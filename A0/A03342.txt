TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, HENRY EARL OF HVNTINGDON, LORD HASTINGS, HVNGERFORD,
BOTTREAVX, MOLINS and MOYLES, Lord Lieutenant of the Counties of LEICESTER, and
RVFLAND, my very singular good LORD.
RIGHT HONORABLE:
THese Lectures which I have for so many years kept by me, and refused to let
them see the light (as judging them both unworthy in themselves to be brought
into public view, and altogether needless also, though they had been much
better, in an age that does so abound with all variety of excellent gifts, both
for preaching and writing) I am now at length (though the importunity of
sundry, that think better of them then my self could ever do;) enforced to
give way that they may be published. And this I have done the more willingly,
that I might have opportunity by this Dedication of them, to give public
testimony unto the world, of my duty and thankfulness unto your Honor, and
unto your Noble House; unto whom (next under God) I do owe whatsoever poor
abilities he has been pleased to give unto me, for the service of his Church.
For as that noble Uncle of yours (whom his wisdom and serviceableness to his
Prince and Country, even with the great neglect of his own estate and family,
and specially his zealous care to promote the Gospel of Christ, did make much
more honorable, then the nobleness of this great birth could possibly do)
did first maintain me in the University, and after brought me to the exercise
of my ministry in this place; so have I been by the favor and bounty of your
noble Grandfather, and of your Honor continued here, now more then forty
years. And unto your honor especially above all other men, is thanks due,
for whatsoever benefit may redound to the Church by these Lectures: because of
that encouragement I did receive from your Lordship in the preaching of them,
not only by your honorable beneficence in maintaining of me, and confirming
that unto me, which by the bounty of your noble Ancestors I did enjoy, but by
that worthy example also you gave unto all my Auditory in your constant and
diligent frequenting of them. Which as you would never have done if you had not
liked them well, or if you had heard any thing taught in them that did disagree
with the Doctrine of our Church, or that had any way tended unto schism or
faction: so have you made me the more bold even in this respect, humbly to
commend the patronage of them unto your Honor. Now the Lord of Lords (who has
already made you truly honorable, not by your Progenitors only, but by many
noble endowments bestowed upon your self, and has promised also to honor
them that honor him:) continue and multiply all his graces and blessings upon
your Lordship, and upon your family, to the increase of your present and
everlasting comfort, through JESUS CHRIST. So prays still:

Ashby-Delazouch, June the first, 16^8. Your Honors to all duty and service
ever most obliged: ARTHVR HILDERSAM.

TO THE GODLY READER, WHETHER MINISTER, OR PRIVATE CHRISTIAN.
THis Book which now at the length, the good hand of God has put into thy
hand to read, deserves a name in this kind of writing (to speak freely and
at once, what I truly judge) like one of the chief of David's Worthies, not
amongst the thirty, but amongst the first three. In reading most of the best
Books extant, the studious Reader is wont to select and transcribe the pith of
such Notes, as stand like Lights, or Goades, or Nails, in the body of the
discourse, and in the Spirit of the Writer: But in this Book (to tell you what
I find) I find such variety of choice matter running throughout every Vein of
each discourse herein handled, and carried along with such strength of sound
and deep Judgment, and with such Life and Power of an heavenly Spirit, and
withal expressed in such pithy and pregnant words of wisdom, that I knew not
what to select, and what to omit, unless I should have transcribed the whole
Book.

In the Authors manner of handling this Scripture, Ministers shall observe a
double excellency: i. e. An exemplary Pattern of Preaching in the evidence of
the Spirit. The evidence of the Spirit is shown in discovering the hidden
Treasures of the Graces of the Spirit, partly breathing in the Scriptures
(which he either handles of purpose, or alleges occasionally; partly flowing
out of the abundance of the good treasure of his own heart. Both which
manifested to the conscience of the Hearer, do shine like a light in a dark
place, and do discover both God to the Soul, and the Soul (in his own
feeling) unto God, so that the Soul discerning the presence and Power of God,
is ready to cry out (like Jacob) Doubtless God is in this place; this is no
other but the Word of Life, this is the gate of heaven.

Again Ministers may further observe in this Treatise, an exemplary Pattern
of reading and studying the Scriptures, so as thereby to make a man of God
perfect to every work of his Ministry. For this Treatise euidenceth, that this
Author in reading the Scriptures, has so diligently pondered, and searched out
the true sense of the Holy Ghost, and has so wisely digested the knowledge and
wisdom of the Scriptures to the clearing of every Commonplace, and Doctrine
of Religion, that whether he speak to Explication, or Application of any Text,
He fitly and fully amplifieth and presses all, from Scripture-grounds: that
you may at once both adore the perfection of God in the Scriptures, making the
Man of God perfect unto every good work: and may also admire the dexterity, and
skill of a Scribe taught unto the kingdom of God, and bringing out of his
treasure things both new and old.

When Scholars furnish themselves with store of other writers, besides the
Scriptures, and being little conversant in the Scriptures do draw the
Scriptures to the Authors, whom they most affect, and not their A^thors to the
Scriptures, their Divinity proves but Humanity, and their Ministry speaks
to the brain, but not to the conscience of the Hearer. But he that diggeth all
the Treasures of his knowledge, and the grounds of Religion out of the
Scriptures, and makes use of other authors, not for ostentatio^ of himself,
nor for the ground of his faith, nor for the principal ornament of his
Ministry, but for the better searching out of the deep wisdom of the
Scriptures, such an one belieueth what he teaches, not by an humane Credulity
from his Author, but by a divine faith from the Word: and because he belieueth,
he therefore speaks: and speaking from faith in his own heart, he speaks
much more powerfully unto the begetting and strengthening of faith in the
Hearer.

The private Christian in the diligent survey of this Treatise, shall observe
lively decyphered, the scornful vanity of corrupt Nature, the lothsomenesse
and desperate danger of sin, the wonderful power of Gods Grace in the
conversion of a sinner, the trial of a man's own deceitful heart, the amiable
life of Gods grace in the regenerate, the comfortable benefit of afflictions,
sundry sweet consolations of a troubled spirit, the vanity of Popery, the
necessity of a faithful Ministry, the beauty of Gods Ordinances holily
administered, and the resolution of sundry cases of conscience fitting these
times: and all delivered with such evidence of Scripture Light, and Christian
experience, that the hearts of the godly Readers, will at once bless God, who
has given such gifts to men: and bless the Writer, who having spent the
strength of his years in a faithful and fruitful Ministry (to the great
comfort and succor of many Ministers, and people, far and near, round about
him) does now at last adorn his hoarie head with this Crown of glory, to
bring forth his works to more public Light, now more at the last, then at the
first.

My hearts desire is, that God would add yet many days more to the Authors
life, and support him still both in body and spirit, to bring to light many
other such monuments of his fruitful labors: not only that elaborate
Commentary upon the 51. Psalm, but likewise such Sermons or Treatises, or
Letters touching cases of Conscience, as happily have lyenby him, these many
years. Why should any Talent lie buried in a Napkin, or candle lie hid under a
bushel, which being set on a candlestick, might give light to all that are in
the house? Such (Opuscula) little Treatises, as himself would hardly
acknowledge under his own Name, might be of special use, and much esteem,
with others. Witness those questions and Answers, wherein he has comprised
the doctrine of the Lords Supper: which though without his Name, they be
annexed to a little Treatise of the like Argument, set forth by a godly learned
Divine, M. William Bradshaw: yet have they been of singular good use to many
poor souls, for their worthy preparation to that Ordinance. And in very deed
they do more fully furnish a Christian to that whole spiritual Duty, then any
other, in any language (that I know) in so small a compass: yea, and that one
Letter of his to a Gentlewoman against the separation which without his
consent, a separatist printed and refuted, has so strongly and clearly
convinced the iniquity of that way, that I could not but acknowledge in it both
the wisdom of God, and the weakness of the separatist. His wisdom, in
bringing to light such a beam of the Light of his truth by the hand of an
adversary, against the Authors mind: and the weakness of the other, to
advance the hand of his adversary to give himself, and his cause such a deadly
wound in open view, as neither himself nor all his associates can be able to
heal. In which respect, I conceive it was, that the industrious Doctor Willet
(in his Dedicatory Epistle to CHRIST'S College, before his harmony upon the
first of Samuel) styles this our Author, Schismaticorum (quivulgo Brownistae)
Malleum, the Hammer of Schismatiques, whom they commonly call Brownists.

Now the God of all grace, prosper the works of his servants, to those good
ends himself has appointed, and they have aimedat, the glory of his own
great Name, in the edification and salvation of his people in Christ.

So I take leave, and rest, desirous to provoke my self and thee to a
thankful, and fruitful use of such mercies.

The unworthiest of the least of Gods Mercies, and Servants: I. C.

A Table of some principal Points that are handled in these Lectures.
Abstinence.
See Fasting.
Admonition.
See Reproof.
Adoption.
A. NO man can worship God aright till he have the Spirit of Adoption, and can
conceive of God, as of his loving Father, page 182 Four notes to try whether
we do indeed know God to be our Father, page 183.
Adoration, Worship. See Reverence.
The whole worship of God, is called Adoration, page 111.
Admiring of men.
It is folly and sin to admire any man much, page 40.
Affection.
He that has an upright heart, serves God with affection, page 480. No service
pleases God, that is not done with feeling and affection, page 198, 199.
Natural Affection.
See Parents.
Affl^ction.
In it own nature it is a curse, neither is it a sign of Gods love to all,
page 394. The greatest may not hope to be exempted from it. page 388. All men
should prepare for it; and how, 389 It is greatly profitable and necessary for
Gods Elect, page 394. It is no sign of Gods wrath, but of his love rather,
page 398. We may be sure God will do us good by it, and remove it when it has
wrought kindly on us, and support us in it, and give a comfortable end unto it,
page 399. It is a sign of election to profit by it, and the contrary of
reprobation, page 401. In every affection we should take notice that God is
angry with us, page 402. Six degrees of Gods proceeding in sanctifying
affections to us, which may be, so many notes to try whether our affections be
san-ctified, page 40^. 40^. Extremity of it will make us unfit, both to profit
by the Word, and to pray. page 433
Alacrity.
See Cheerfulness.
Antiquity.
How far forth it is to be regarded in the matter of Religion, page 141. It is
dangerous to ascribe too much to it, 144 Our Religion is most ancient, 145. The
popish plea touching the antiquity of theirs, is most vain and insufficient,
ibid.
Apostacy. See Perseverance.
How far forth the good things that have been in a man, may be lost, ^0, 51.
A dangerous thing to fall from grace, or to decay in it, 54. Two chief causes
of it, ibid. Comfort for the faithful that live in times of general
Apostacy, 430, 431.
Apostles.
Christ has taught his Church the whole will of his Father by them, 207.
Apparel.
See Attire.
Appearance
of evil is to be avoided, 86.
Application.
Ministers must apply the Word, and hearers must endure it, 373, 374.
Assemblies.
See Church Assemblies.
Assurance of salvation.
See Certainty of salvation.
Attention.
All should attend diligently at the hearing of the Word, 125. 134. 135. Means
to keep our hearts attentive from wandering in prayer, etc. 198.
Attire.
Modesty in attire required of Christians, 87.
Authority.
The wicked are apt to abuse the authori^y and credit of holy men, to the
disgrace of Gods truth, 35 273. This honor is due to Christ alone to be
believed (in matter of Doctrine) upon his bare Word, 149. Nothing is to be
believed and received in religion, upon the credit and authority of any man,
1^0.
B.
Baptism.
It is both unprofitable and hurtful to the wicked, 5. The whole congregation
should continue together at the Administration of it, 120. It should be
administered in the public assembly, 12^.
Blessing.
The ecclesiastical Blessing pronounced by the Minister, is not to be
neglected, ibid. What behavior is fittest for the people to use then, 126.
Body.
Care is to be had even of our body, and of the body of our neighbor, 256,
257. The sin of them that by disorder over throw their health, 258. God
requires bodily service of us, as well as spiritual, 189. 190. Christ in the
days of his flesh showed his miraculous power most in curing the bodies of
men, 445.
Brownists. See Church.
Their sin is great in separating from our Churches, 1^7.
C.
Calling.
A man may be soundly religious, and yet follow diligently his wordly Calling,
238. Cautions for them that leave the works of their Calling to follow Sermons
on the week days, 2^0. Calling, how far it may be neglected, ibid.
Calling to the Ministry.
Wherein the inward calling does principally consist, 261.
Catechizing.
It is a profitable and necessary duty of the Minister, 205.
Censures of the Church.
The neglect of them toward scandalous sinners, is a great contempt done to
Gods Worship, 132, 133.
Ceremonies.
Difference in judgment about Ceremonies, should not alienate the affections
of brethren, 301. 303. 30^.
Ceremonial Law. See Worship.
It was a carnal Worship, 184, 185. It was abrogated at Christ's Passion, 188.
The Ceremonies were shadows, and we have have in our Worship the substance of
that that was signified by them, 186. 188. Popery exceeds iudaisme in
Ceremonies and therein discouers much hypocrisy, 197, 198
Certainty in Religion.
The Elect and such as have good hearts, may attain unto it, 140 212. 214.
Means whereby we may attain to it: 140. Comfort for Gods people that
complain they want it, 215. All men are bound to seek for it, 138. 141. They
that have historical faith are certainly persuaded of whatsoever God has
revealed in his Word, 332. The faithful are certain that the Scripture is the
Word of God, and that it is God himself that speaks to them in his Word,
349.
Certainty of salvation.
All the faithful are not in the same measure certain of their salvation,
333. They that have the greatest certainty are not without al doubts and
distrusts, 333. 348. 349. Nor feel this certainty at all times, 336. They that
have most assurance, must yet live in fear, 334. Yet may the faithful in this
life be certain of their salvation, 334. 341. All are bound to seek for this
certainty, 341. 342. The means whereby it may be obtained, 343 The notes whereby
true assurance may be discerned from that which is counterfeit, 345 Comfort to
the faithful that complain they want it, 215, 216.
Cheerfulness.
Required in all the duties of Gods service, 263 It is a sin in the faithful
to be vncheerefull, ^0 They have just cause to be cheerful, and to serve God
willingly, notwithstanding their infirmities, 265, 266. 461.
Chambering. See Dalliance.

Children.
They should seek to requite their parents love, 391.
Christ.
He is the greatest gift that ever God gave to man, 11. How far He was abased
for our sakes, 12. Why he is called Christ and Messiah, 200. 202. The benefit
and merit of his death belongs not to all men, 329. Yet is it necessary, that
the benefit men received by him, should be expressed in most general terms,
330. Poor sinners should go boldly to him in all their distresses, 450. We
should not rest contented with any blessing, till we have Christ, 14. Notes to
know whether Christ be ours, 15. He did constantly use prayer, and other parts
of Gods worship, and why, 163, 164. He is in the ministry of the Word to be
offered unto all in a most general manner, 330.
Church.
Papists give more credit to it, then to the Word, 150. 348. We may not
separate from a true Church that enioyes the Word, and professes the Doctrine
of salvation, for the corruptions that are in it, 165, 166. 384, 385. Yet may
we not communicate with a true Church, in any corruption, 167. Every man is
bound to join himself unto and to be a member of the true Church, 138 The
profession of the true Doctrine of Christ, is the only proper and certain note
of the true Church, 167. How far forth the testimony of the Church helps to
bring us to faith, 348, 349.
Church Assemblies.
They are a means of our protection and safety from all dangers, 382. The most
public and solemn Church Assemblies, are greatly to be esteemed and
frequented, 129. 153. The sin of such as neglect them, 128. The greatest are
hound to carry themselves reverently in them, 117.
Circumcision.
What it signified, 180.
Comfort.
To be found in Christ in all our distresses, 450 No worldly thing can yield
comfort to the distressed in mind, 44, 45. The Spirit of grace and
regeneration is able to do it abundantly, and nothing else 46. They that fear
God have cause to be comfortable, and upon what grounds, 90. Fine rules of
comfort for such as are afflicted in mind, 346, 347. See Prayer.
Commonnesse of sin.
Sin is never the less dangerous to a man bebecause it is general, 74. 384.
How to carry our selves in evil times, when foul sins grow common and
general, 428, 429 It should trouble us and cause us to look for some common
calamity, ibid.
Company.
Haunting bad company, argues a bad heart, 87 What they should do that live in
evil times and places, 429.
Commonwealth.
The true causes why God spares our land though sin abound in it, 429.
Conference.
Cautions for them that confer and move questions of Religion, 499, 500.
Confession.
The properties required to true confession, 85. No man is bound to acknowledge
all his sins to a priest, 102. He that is truly penitent, will be ready to
acknowledge his sin, even unto men, when he is charged with it, 103. It is
profitable and necessary to confess some sins, even unto men, and dangerous to
hide them, 103, 104.
Conscience.
A good Conscience will breed unspeakable peace and joy, 437. 438. And
assurance of a man's salvation, 343.
Constancy.
Constancy in obedience a good sign, 481.
Contentment.
Grace breeds Contentment, 3.
Controversies.
Every Christian is not bound to study controversies, nor to meddle with them,
136. Yet some are, 137.
Conversion.
No man (by nature) can do any thing to help forward his own conversion, 20.
It is a miraculous work of God, 29. They that are truly religious, will be
careful to w^nne others to God, 224. 235. Who are most charged and have most
opportunity to do good this way, 236. Note of a true Convert, 239. True
Conuerts show great respect and reverence unto their Ministers, 215. Conversion
of man depends on Gods free grace 250. Four things required in them that would
win others to God, 236. Private Christians have many ways whereby they may ^in
others. 245. All men are bound to do what they can to win others to God, 3^4.
Gods manner of working in man's conversion is diverse and wonderful, 325. 326.
Country.
Every man owes a duty to the place of his birth and breeding, 351.
Credit.
A great sin for a man to be careless of it, 86.
Custom.
The good customs of a Church are not to be broken or neglected, 143. 144. Yet
it is dangerous (in matter of Religion) to ascribe too much unto it, 144. Most
men make common custom the rule of their conscience, 426. Remedies against
this corruption, 427.
D.
Dalliance.
Wanton dalliance is dangerous and sinful, 90. Death. Faith will make a man
willing to die, 337. Every man should look and prepare for sudden death, 44^,
443.
Delay.
It is dangerous to put off the making of peace with God till sickness, 442.
443.
Delight.
Natural and worldly means of delight are not unlawful, and what cautions
are to be used in this, 439. 440.
Desire.
An unfeigned desire of grace, is a singular grace, 9. Five differences in this
desire, between the natural man and the regenerate, 9. He that has saving
knowledge will feel the want of it, and desire it, 22.
Disputing.
It is dangerous to dispute against known truths, 151.
Dissension.
How far forth Ministers should seek to agree, and the means how that may be,
301. Difference in judgments should not alienate godly men's affections one
from another, 302
Domestical Instruction and Worship.
We should use the exercises of Religion in our families, 157. How and by what
means a man should best instruct and win his family unto God, 241
Doubting.
Doubtfulnesse and unsettledness in matters of our faith and religion is
dangerous, 137. 140 Even the doubting of the truth of ought God has said, is a
dangerous sin, 413, 414.
E.
Examination.
Christians should examine that, that is taught them, 151, 152. And the good
things seem to be in our selue, 53. Every affliction should drive us to
examine what it is that has thus provoked God, ^04
Examples.
The examples of some men do great hurt in hardening of others, 74. Many make
this the rule of their conscience, and remedies against this corruption, 426.
It is not safe to make the best man's examples the rule of our conscience, 428.
Exercises of Religion. See Christian domest^call worship.
Every man is bound to spend some part of every day in them, 241. The
conscionable use of them will preserve us from sin, 93.
Eye.
A covenant is to be made with our eye, 91.
F.
Faith.
Motives and encouragements to believe in Christ, 13, 14. How to know whether
we have truly received Christ, 15. In it there is a particular application of
Christ, 310. There is great certainty and assurance in true says, 3. 8. 332.
It works 1 peace of conscience, 2 joy in the Holy Ghost, 3 boldness in prayer,
4 willingness to die, 335, 336, 337. True faith is grounded upon the word
only, and neither upon sense or experience, 348, 349. Most men ground their
faith not upon the Word, but upon sense only, 420. He that has true faith,
has an upright heart, and none but he, 484. Four notes to try it by, 484. It
is imperfect in the best, 333, 334. It breeds in the heart true joy, and that
upon five grounds, 436, 437.
Falls of the godly.
How far the regenerate man may fall from grace, 50, 51, 54. Great difference
between them and the sins of the wicked, 455. 471. 473.
Family. See Domestical.
Sin will bring Gods curse upon the house and place where it is committed, 158.
Piety will bring Gods blessing upon our houses and dwellings, ibid.
Fasting.
Christ put no holiness in fasting nor was given unto it, ^56.
Fathers.
No cause why we should so rely upon the Fathers as many do, 39. The Papists
give not more due honor to them then we, 38. What respect is to be had to our
Fore- fathers in the matter of Religion, 142, 143. We do not condemn our Fore-
Fathers, 145.
Feasting.
Though it be lawful, yet it must not be ordinary, 92.
Fewness of Believers.
Comfort for the faithful that live where they have few or none that join
with them in piety, 430, 431.
Fornication.
It is a most heinous sin, 71. Four causes of the commonnes of it now, 74.
Both Magistrates and private men should show their zealous hatred to it, 78,
79. Fornicators must look for Gods judgments even in this life, 79, 80. They
have also cause to fear the judgment of final impenitency and hardness of
heart, 84 We may not give men cause to suspect us to be given to this sin,
and that is done four ways, 87. Seven Preservatives from this sin, 90.
Frugality.
A Christian should be frugall, and seek to increase his worldly estate, 238.
G.
Gestures.
Rules for bodily gestures in Gods worship, 118, 119.
Gifts.
All difference in gifts among Ministers, does not make an inequality between
them, because one may excel in one gift and one in another, 307, 308. The
variety and difference among Gods servants makes much for his glory, 308. They
should be teachable and receive the word with all readiness, and wherein it
consists, 312, 213. God has given a variety of gifts to all men, not all to
any one man, 308. Variety of gifts and graces increases love and unity among
men, 319. It is a sin against God, and contempt done unto his good gifts, not
to make use and profit of them, 320. Gods children ought to make use of their
Ministers gifts in private, 321. That gift is to be esteemed best which edifies
most, 287. 291.
God.
Why he (even the whole Trinity) is called Father, 148. His love is
unchangeable, 180. 340. The knowledge of his omni-presence, and omniscience is
of great necessity and use, 67. 70. He hates and is severe against the sins
even of his own people, 95. Gods servants in private may forbear to reprove
some, 293.
Grace.
The love of God in Christ to us is most free, 14 Grace (and the means thereof)
is highly to be esteemed, 53. Grace may be known, 463. Notes whereby grace may
be known, 468. The diversity of the gifts of God in men comes of his free
disposition, 308.
H.
Hardness of heart.
Wicked men harden themselves in sin even by the Word. 57, 58. They are apt to
harden their own hearts against Gods corrections, 402.
Hearing.
A great sin to hear with delight filthy songs and talk, 88. The necessity of
constant hearing of the word 278. Cautions and encouragements for them that
follow Sermons on the week days, 240. Hear as often as thou may, 172. What
behavior is fittest at the hearing of the Word preached, 125, 126. 134. The
best way to win others to God, is to draw them to hear, 246.
Hearers.
Be willing to hear one truth as well as another, 59. A good sign to like
that Ministry best, that does most effectually discover to a man his sin, 112,
113. Examine that that is taught, 152. Pains must be taken (in four things)
to profit by that we hear and read, 173. Consider of the true cause, why thou
profitest not by the means of grace, and be troubled for it, 250. We may
lawfully frequent that Ministry we can best profit by, 253. Cautions for them
that leave their own Pastors to hear others, 268. 270. Their goodness and
badnes is of great force to hearten or discourage their ministers, 293. 295
Though they may affect some Minister more then other, yet must they reverence
and love every faithful Minister, 305. 309. They that have truth of grace,
will gladly, show kindness to Gods faithful Ministers, 315. 285. The chief
kindness they can show to their Teachers, is to make use of their gifts and
obey their Doctrine, 319, 320, 321. A good sign of Election to profit by that
thou hear presently, and by all thou hear; yet all the Elect do not so,
305. 308. They must yield honor to their Ministers, and that consists in four
things, 358. 362. The Ministers weaknesses should not cause any to despise
their Ministry, 371. 372. They should esteem their own minister best and the
true cause why they do not, 366, 367. 342. When they are said to receive Gods
Ministers, 374. Try thy estate by the judgment thou have to discern of sound
teaching, 313. The sin both of curious and careless hearers, 151 A dangerous
sign to enjoy long good means, and not to profit by it, 305, ^06. Praise God
even for the great variety of able teachers thou enioyest, 308, 309. Seek to
live under such a ministry as thou may profit by, 199. What hearers they be
that do rightly comme^d and praise their Teachers, 199. Hear with judgment,
291. They should propound their doubts to their Teachers, 227, 228. Hearers
duty, 227. Hearing men of better gifts, breeds a loathing of the gifts of their
own Pastor, ^09. It is the Hearers fault that he profits not by the meanest
Minister, 309. Hearers ought to go with an open heart, willing to learn
whatsoever shall please God to teach them, 312. Hearers ought likewise to go
with a resolution to obey, what shall be taught the^ of God, 312 Hearers ought
not to dispute against any truth revealed of God by their Minister, though it
be contrary to their reason and humor, 312. Hearers may not refuse information
from any, though their inferior, 312. It argues an ungracious heart when a man
cannot be persuaded of a truth, 314. Partiality in bearers and the grounds
thereof, 306, 307.
Holiness of places, or things.
Though before Christ's death some places were holier then others, yet now none
are so, 153 150. Reasons against popish superstition in this point, 15^.
Humiliation.
It pleases God highly to see us hunbled, when he shows himself angry, 403.
Hypocrisy.
The natural man has self respects in all the shows he makes of goodness,
55. 58. Many love Religion for their worldly aduan. tage, 56. God cannot abide
the service, that hypocrites do, unto him, 193. Yet must they serve God for all
that, 194. There be three kinds of hypocrites, 198, 199. He strengthens
himself in his sin, even by the Word. 57. The Hypocrite is in a woeful case,
58. 465. Yet many good things may be in him, 467. 481, 482.
I.
Idleness.
It is a sin and provocation to lust, 92.
I^wes.
The Church of the Jews was extremely corrupt in Christ's time, 165. The
Church of the Jews is the Mother and Primitive Church from which all true
Churches are derived, 175. 179. How unlikely it is that that people should find
mercy with God above all other people, 177. Yet so it shall be, and the reason
of it, 177, 178 How we should stand affected to the name and nation of the
Jews, 179, 180.
Ignorance.
It is the chief cause of prophanes and al sin, 16 The danger of it, 16, 17.
137, 138. How men are kept from the sense of that danger, 17, 18. The extreme
ignorance of most people, 18. 152 Wilful ignorance will be no advantage to
any, 424. Comfort for the faithful that complain of it, ^15. The extreme
blockishnesse of all men by nature, 27.
Impatiencie.
It is a judgment that iewd men have cause to fear, 83, 84.
Impenitencie.
Sin is never the less dangerous to a man, because men punish it not, 77, 78,
79. 388. Impenitencie in sin, 68.
Infidelity.
Men are apt to believe God, no further then they see means of help, 30.
Remedies against this corruption, 31, 32. It is a most heinous sin, 32. Gods
people need not despair of help from him in any distress, 3^. Four
preservatives against the doubting of the truth of Gods Word, 415. The danger
of them that cannot believe the Word, and that most that live in the Church are
such, 416. And of such as cannot be persuaded of many truths though most
clearly taught, 424
Infirmities.
God will not reject the services of his people for their infirmities, 97. The
regenerate have infirmities, but no reigning sins, 452. All men are too apt to
despise their brethren for their infirmities; see remedies against this
corruption, 458. The Lord is displeased even with the infirmities of his
children, 452. Yet will not reject his children for their infirmities, 452.
Intent.
A good intent how far forth it makes men's actions good, 433.
Joy.
We should joy much in the conversion and forwardness of others, 266. 268.
Faith breeds joy in the heart, 336. 436. Four means of sound joy, 436. 440.
Vain is the joy of all carnal men, 437.
Day of Judgment.
Why the Lord has appointed it to be at the end of the world, 297.
Judgments of God.
The Lord cannot endure to see men slight and contemn his judgments, 403,
404. See commonnesse of sin, and signs, and Commonwealth.
Judging rashly.
Despair of none so long as they have the means, and are willing to hear,
30^. How far forth we are bound to esteem well of all that profess the fear
of God, 457, 458 See infirmities.
K.
Kneeling.
It is the fittest gesture to be used in prayer, 124. 134. The sin of such as
drink healths kneeling, 134.
Knowledge.
We should labor to breed it in all we have charge of, 18. 205. The means to
bring men unto it, 20. 140. All knowledge in Religion argues not truth of
grace, 21. 203. 204. How many wicked men attain to a great measure of it, 204.
Saving knowledge is to be sought for, 22. He that has it, feels the want of
it, and desires increase, 22. How it may be differenced from that that is
natural, ^3. 206. 469. It cannot be attained without an effectual knowledge
of sin, 64. More is required of some then others; yet all must seek for a
clear and certain knowledge in Religion, 1^6. No man can know God aright, but
by his Word, and the difference of the knowledge got by other means and this,
160. No vprightnes of heart without sanctified knowledge, 468, 469. Carnal men
attain to knowledge of the truth and how, 204. Why God imparts it unto them,
204. The knowledge even of the unregenerate (if they belong to God) is a great
advantage unto them, 205. Who know Christ, less regard the world, 238.
Knowledge, sanctified notes thereof, 238, 239. The benefit of such as desire
knowledge 360.
L.
Liberty.
The true knowledge of our Christian liberty in the use of things indifferent,
is a great help against unnecessary heaviness and sorrow, 439, 440.
Lectures.
On the week day are lawful, ^42.
Love.
Love of the regenerate, 480. Love of the people is true when they make use of
their Ministers gifts, and will be direrected by them, 319. To love and
countenance a Minister, but not to hear him, may procure a temporal reward,
but no sound comfort, 321.
M.
Masters of families.
They should see that their whole family join with them in Gods worship, 123.
How they should gain love and reverence from their servants, 496.
Matrimony
Second marriages are lawful, 7^. Though Marriage be not necessary for all,
for some it is, 94.
Means.
The Lord does often both prepare me^ to grace and confirm them in it, by other
means besides his word, 417. Of grace, not to be despised because they seem
weak and contemptible, 32. Both the giving of them, and the success of them,
depends only on the good pleasure of God, 250. 253. To sin against the means
of grace greatly aggrauates sin, 422.
Melancholy.
We are bound to strive against the passion of it, 434. The best means to
preserve us from the danger of it, see sorrow.
Mercy of God.
The hainousest sins of the Elect, hinders not God from calling them, 95. He
thinks never the worse of them, for their old sins, after their conversion,
96. 97. He reiects not their services for the corruptions that cleave to them,
97, 98. 192. He causes their fow lest sins to turn to their great good, ^8.
The knowledge of it tends greatly to the comfort of the faithful. 99. He will
not reject his children for their infirmities, but is therein very tender and
respectfull toward them, 452. Four things in the Lords gracious disposition,
that should move us to serve him willingly, 463.
Mercifulness.
We should learn to be merciful by the example of our heavenly Father, 100.
Ministers.
They must do the work of their calling with a willing mind, 261. Their mutual
agreement and love will much further the Gospel, 299. Yet are we not bound to
agree with or like of all, but we may lawfully discountenance and publicly
reprove some Ministers, 300. 301. The difference in judgment or practice,
about the Ceremonies, should not alienate the affections of godly Ministers one
from another, ^01. 303. He must be diligent and careful to teach profitably,
367. He must be faithful and wherein that consists, 367. 368. His life must be
exemplary for piety, 368. They had need be godly men, 215. They should
encourage their people to move their doubts to them, 227. What they should do,
when the people leave them to hear others, 271. Faithful ones need not fear
want, but shall be sure of good reward, 8^. His chief care should be to see
fruit of his labors, and how he may do that, 284, 289, 290. The best have been
apt to be discouraged by the badnesse of their hearers, 294. They must not
envy, but esteem lovingly and reverently of their brothers, 297. How far they
should seek to agree together, and how that may be wrought, 299. 305. The
Minister to which a man belongs, is not to be forsaken, 269. Ministers that are
faithful shall be rewarded, 283. A faithful Minister need not be covetous for
the things of this life, nor fear the malice or subtlety of enemies, 284.
Ministers must labor to be fruitful, 289. Ministers encouraged by peoples
forwardnes, 293. A man may be a faithful Minister and approved of God, though
his gifts be far inferior to other of his fellow laborers, 309. Ministers
ought not to be daunted in the presence of any wicked in the exercise of their
Ministry, 294. Ministers ought to carry themselves so as that they may deserve
respect from the people, 316. Ministers are bound to teach the whole council
of God, 317. Corruptions may be in the delivery of the truth, but the Word has
no corruption in it, 317. A Minister may tell his people of the duty they owe
him, and yet not be proud, 317. Their faults may be publicly and sharply
reproved, 300, ^1. There is an honor due to every true Minister, 360. 375. The
Lord makes high account of the honor that is done to his faithful Ministers,
and is highly displeased with the contempt and indignities done to them, 359.
This should not puff him up, but humble him, 361. Four degrees of honor due
to them, 362. They have (for the most part) least esteem in their own
country, and amongst them that are nearest to them in birth and acquaintance,
364. How they may get and maintain reverence in the peoples hearts, 367, 368.
They should strive to apply them particularly to their hearers, 373. They have
authority to reprove sin in any man, 106. 360. They must not be discouraged at
the unfruitfulness of their labors, 3^8. The people look for angelical
perfection in them, 366. The faithful one shall be sure to have both honor,
maintenance, and fruit of his labors, 375. Comfort for them against the
contempt of their calling and persons, 376. The fearful estate of such as
despise, or do any indignity to them, 359. 360. 376. Men show respect to their
Ministers and comfort them, when they make use of their gifts in private, 319.
Conceitednesse is a cause they do not, 222. The Priests had their houses near
the Temple for this end, 221.
Ministry of the Word. See Means.
Great is the necessity of it, 278, 279. A sound Ministry is the strength of a
State, 279 This of the new Testament is far more fruitful then that was under
the law, 287, 288, 289. A great mercy to teach us by men, rather then
immediately or by Angels, 107, ^42. It is the salvation of men, and why it is so
called, 2^7, 168. How it becomes effectual, 169. Whom God intends to save, he
gives the ministry of the Word unto, and grace to profit by it, 305, 306. God
has been wont to make it effectual in as many as he means to save, within a
short time after they have first enjoyed it, 324, 325. God never gives it to
any people, but he makes it effectual to save some, 376. 289. The ministry of
the new Testament in regard of the profitablenesse of it to win souls is far
more excellent then that of the old, 287 The ministy of the Prophets prepared
men to receive the ministry of the Gospel, 287. They that esteem of the
message, esteem of the messenger, 309. Ministry effectual, 28^. Ministry of
the Word of great necessity, 278.
Miracles.
The chief end of them was (not to convert men, but) to gain credit to the
Word in their hearts, and make them willing to hear, 37. New forms of Gods
worship and new functions were wont to be confirmed by miracles, 378. We need
none now, 378. Popish miracles are false and counterfeit, 379. They are not
done by the power of Christ, 449 Christ showed his power most in curing the
bodies of men, 445. 447. Six points observed in these miraculous cures 446.
Difference between Christ's miracles, and those of the Prophets and Apostles,
447, 448
Multitude.
Faults that the common sort are especially addicted unto, 2^4. It is no safe
thing to do as the most do, 427. Comfort for the godly that are scorned for
their singularity, because they will not do as the most do, 430. 431.
N.
Name.
A man is bound to have care of his good name, 86. Why Hebrew names are used in
the new Testament, and why we give Hebrew names to our children, 202.
Nature.
See how void of all goodness, and full of corruption every natural man is,
26, 28. How much goodness may be in a natural man, 174.
Nazaret.
Why our Savior did shun preaching in Nazaret above all other places, 351,
352.
O.
Obedience.
No service pleases God but that that is done in obedience to his Word, 160.
This is a certain note of an upright heart, 473 Seven notes of sincere
Obedience, 474. Regenerate able to obey, 473. Difference betwixt obedience of
regenerate and other, ibid. Others salvation to be sought, 246.
Obstinacy. See hardness of heart.
This greatly aggrauates sin, 422. Most men that live in the Church, sin
obstinately, 424. Four signs of a heart that is not hardened nor obstinate in
sin, 423. The fearful state of the obstinate, 423.
P.
Painting.
Painting of the face is unlawful, 87.
Papists.
They are like to the Samaritans in many things, 36, 37. They are Idolaters,
and worship the devil, 163
Parents.
Great is their affection to their children, 391. This should confirm us in
the assurance of Gods love to his children, 392. They must take heed of over
loving their children, and how we may best do them good, 392. What respect is
to be had to the example of our parents in the matter of Religion, 143. The
hope and comfort Christian Parents may have concerning their children, 180.
Their sins will bring Gods curse upon their children and what sins chiefly,
393. What a kind of service and solemnity it was, 380.
Patience.
The faithful have been very patient in affliction, and showed it four
ways, 398. The means to breed it in us, 398. 399.
Peace of conscience.
It is a fruit of true faith, 336. There is a false peace, see presumption.
Every affliction should drive us to make peace with God, and that three ways,
404.
Peace Offerings.
What they signified, 187.
People. See Hearers.

Persecution.
None can be saved that is not willing to suffer, and even to die for the
truth, 139. To deride a Minister, is to persecute him, 28^.
Perseverance.
The regenerate shall persevere and are careful so to do, 481. He that is
truly regenerate, shall never fall fi nally, nor totally, yea he may be in this
life certain of it, 339, 341. Our chief care must be, to be best at our end,
274, 275.
Physic.
They sin greatly that despise or neglect it, 256, 257.
Pilgrimage.
Reasons against it, 156.
Poverty.
The poor that are godly have no cause to murmur, or distrust God, 33. The
frequenting of religious exercises with an honest heart, will beggar no man,
244.
Prayer.
Helps to keep the heart from wandering in it, 198. Every man must ask and cry
for grace, yea all whom God means to save, shall do it, 5 Objection against
the necessity of prayer an swered, 5, 6. All that can unfeignedly seek to God
for grace shall be sure to have it, 8. The weakest Christian should not be
discouraged from prayer, 9. Spiritual blessings rather to be prayed for, then
temporal, 9. Faith breeds boldness in prayer, 336, 337. God seems often to
neglect the prayers of his people, and that four ways, 407. Comfort for Gods
people in this case, 408, 409 Labor to pray so as thou may speed, 411.
Christ himself used much to pray, 203. God delights greatly in the prayers of
his people, 193. Affliction drives the faithful to it, 3^6. Promises upon
which we should ground our faith in prayer, 407. Three reasons why God seems
often to neglect and reject the prayers of his people, 408. Signs whereby we may
know God accepts our prayers, though he grant not our Suit, 410, 411. We should
inquire after the success of our prayers, 411, 412. Properties requisite in
the prayer that would speed well, 412. Poor sinners should go boldly to
Christ for help in all their distresses, 450.
Preaching, See Minisry.
A man may try his estate by the judgment he has to discern of sound
teaching, 113 It is lawful to keep Lectures, and to frequent them even on the
week days, 243. Some are bound to go to Sermons, even on the week day, 242.
Even they that cannot, should yet desire to do it, 243. How to judge of the
best Preachers and Preaching, 291. The necessity of it, 278, 279, 280.
Preparation.
We can do no duty of Gods service well without it, 487. It is a great and
necessary help for our profiting by the Word, 487. This preparation consists
in six points, 489. Think of the evil day and prepare for it, 488
Presumption.
Lewd men have no cause to hope they shall repent and find mercy, 82, 83. They
can have no sound comfort in the knowledge of Gods mercy, 99. 452. They are
confident of their salvation, and the notes whereby true faith may be discerned
from this presumption, 345.
Pride.
Noe sin makes us more odious to God, 394. The greatest must beware they be not
proud, either against God or men, 388. All men are strangly prone to this soul
sin, 295. Affliction is a singular mean to abate it, 395
Profaneness.
The sin of such as carry themselves profanely in Gods public worship, 134,
135.
Profession.
We should all be willing and ready to make profession of our faith, 349, 350.
Professors.
Poor men, young men, such as have been formerly scandalous, and women, have
been usually most forward in Religion, 222. This has been ever a great
scandal to the Word and why, 224. Preservatives against this scandal, 225.
Professors should strive to remove this scandal, and how they may do it,
226.
Providence.
God by his providence gouernes all things; and orders them for the good of his
Elect, 217. The knowledge of this is useful many ways, 219.
Psalms.
It is fit they should be sung in the Congregation, 121, 122. How we should
behave our selves in singing them, 126.
Public worship. See Church Assemblies.
It is necessary all should be present at every part of it, 121. 128. 129. To
be preferred before any private, 129, 130. 153. All should come to the
beginning and stay till the end of it, 120. 131, 132. Rules for reverence in
it, see Reverence. All may profit by every part of it, and every part of it
has good warrant in the Word 121. 122. The whole congregation should join
together in it, as one man, 122, 123.
Q.
Questions, disputing. See Conference.
Never any proved a good Scholar in any learning, but he that had doubts and
would move questions 322. How far forth it is lawful to make question of, or
to reason against Gods Word, or Works, 230, 231.
R.
Reading.
We should exercise our selves in the reading of the Word, 172. 291.
Reason.
A great sin to examine Religion by carnal reason, and to believe no more,
then we can see reason for, 151.
Reformation.
What properties are required in true reformation and leaving of sin, 85.
Regeneration.
Notes to try it by, 5.
Religion.
There is but one true way, to salvation, 139. It is the strength of a state,
429. 279.
Religious duties.
Great force in a conscionable use of them to keep a man from uncleanness and
other sins, 93. And to breed in a man a confortable assurance of his salvation,
343.
Repentance.
There is more required to it, then most men dream, 84, 85. Late repentance is
dangerous, 442. Sins repented of (though never so many and heinous) will make
us never the less acceptable to God, 95. No man has an upright heart, that
forsakes not all known sins, 470. Notes to try our sincerity in leaving of
sin, 471 Repentance, 470. Repentance of regenerate and natural men
distinguished, 471.
Reproof.
The Minister must plainly and particularly reprove sin, 63. Great wisdom is
required in reproouing sin 63 Motives to persuade Ministers to faithfulness in
this, 66. How they may make their reproof effectual, 66. He that has grace,
will take reproof well. and love him the better, that deals faithfully with
him this way, 106. 112, 113. Three things that keep men from accepting it, and
preseruatines against them, 106. Though men's lewdness may restrain us from
reproving them in private; yet may it not their Minister from public reproof,
294, 295. Men disdain to be reproved by such as are no better then
themselves, and four remedies against that corruption, 364, 365. 369, 370 Fret
not against the public reproof of thy sin in the ministry of the word, 108.
373. 374. A common sin it is and dangerous not to endure reproof, 109.
Reverence.
Though outward reverence be not sufficient, yet can we perform no duty of
Gods worship well, especially in public without some signification of
reverence, even in the outward gesture of our body, 115. 120. Reasons for
bodily reverence in all parts of Gods worship, 116. Rules for it, 119, 120.
125. More reverence should be showed at the hearing of the Word read, then
preached, 126. We can perform no service to God well without fear and
reverence, 115.
S.
Sacraments.
Our Sacraements are more clear and effectual then those under the law, ^0.
In the administration of them, we should make use of our eye and behold what is
done, 127.
Sacrifices.
What they and their manner of offering them, did signify, 189.
Samaritans.
The Papists resemble them much, 36.
Scripture.
The undoubted certainty of every thing that is written therein, 249. It is
much more full and perfect now, then it was under the Law, 207. To humble and
honest hearts, they are not obscure, 349. 212. What are the causes why they are
obscure, 213 Pretense of their obscurity will not excuse the neglect of reading
them, 173. Scriptures ought to be the rule of trial, for what is taught. 174.
Secret sins.
The Lord can discern and is privy to our most secret sins, 69. Sin is never
the less dangerous to a man, because it is cunningly and closely committed,
75.
Security.
The false ground on which ignorant and wicked men secure themselves, 76. 429.
General sec^rity is a sign of general calamity approaching, 42^.
Seducers.
They are cunning; and who are most in danger to take hurt by them, 138.
Servants.
They should love their Masters, and desire and seek their comfort, 492.
Sundry other duties they owe, but this is the root of all, 493. Cautions
limiting their duty, 495. Three things whereby they should show their love to
their Masters, 495.
Severity.
Required in the Magistrates and all Christi ans in the discountenancing and
punishing of whoredom and other sins, 78.
Sickness. See Delay.

Signs.
It is not simply unlawful to desire signs for the confirming of our faith,
404. Signs of judgment approaching, 428, 429.
Silence.
From good words not always unlawful, 293
Sin.
Great is the necessity of an effectual knowledge of sin, 6^, 65. The sins of
the elect (how heinous soever) shall not hinder their salvation, but tend to
their good, 95. Dangerous to hide our sins, and that is done four ways, 104.
It will bring Gods curse upon the house and place where it is committed, 158.
It is a most loathsome thing and defiles a man, 4. Satan draws men to sin
through some error of their mind, and by deceiving them, 73. Of sinning against
the Means; see Means. It will certainly bring sorrow, 438, 452.
Sincerity.
The Lord makes great reckoning of the uprightness of the heart, 465.
Necessary to examine whether our hearts be upright, 53, 54. 481. Notes to try
that by, 53. ^9. 471. 473. 476 480 The Lord delights in the weakest services
that are done in spirit and truth, 192, 193. 465. He that has an upright heart
may know he has it, 239. We should labor by diligent examination to find
whether our hearts be upright, 465 466.
Sorrow.
Properties required in the sorrow for sin, 85. Extremity if it will disable us
from praying and profiting by the Word, 433. Moderate is very profitable and
necessary, 4^3. We must strive against that that is excessive and immoderate,
43^. Four remedies against such, 436. There is great difference between that
of the regenerate and that of the carnal man, 437. Sin will bring sorrow, and
great sins great sorr^wes, 438.
Soul.
All men's chief care should be for their souls, 450.
Speech.
To speak wickedly is a greater degree of sin then to think ill, 228. Filthy
speech a great sin, 87. So is the delight to hear it, 88.
Spirit.
The spirit of God (in whomsoever it dwells;) is like unto water in four
respects, 3. Why God is called a spirit, 196. By the testimony of the spirit
the faithful are assured of their salvation; and he that has it, may know he
has it, 339. The Lord requires and delights in the service of the spirit, see
Worship.
Superiors.
Disdain not to be admonished or reproved by thy inferior, 107.
Superstition.
Papists are many ways grossly superstitious, 156, 157
Supper of the Lord.
It should be administered in the public assembly, 122.
T.
Talk see Speech. Tractablenesse.
A good sign of election to receive the truth with all readiness, 312, 313.
Affliction opens the ear and makes men tractable, 397. We should pray for a
tractable heart, four notes to try it by, 423. The danger of such as cannot
be persuaded of many truths, though they be never so clearly taught and
confirmed to them, 424, 425. This hypocrisy is in all by nature, that they
scorn to be taught by such in whom they discern any infirmity, 365. Remedies
against this corruption, 371
Temperance.
It is necessary even in our diet, 92.
Temples.
Our Churches need not to be stately and glorious, as the Temple of Jerusalem
was, 119. Neither is there that holiness to be ascribed to, or reverence due
to our Churches, as was to that Temple, 119. 154. Neither is there that
necessity of temples now, as there was under the law, 119. Yet is it fit we
also should have places set apart for Gods public worship; and (having such)
it is no where so well done as in them, 119. 129. Even our Churches should be
decently kept, 120. 127. The temple of Jerusalem was a Type of Christ and how,
155.
Tentation.
We must carefully shun tentation, 89. Tentations incident to our lawful
calling, God will preserve us in, 89.
Terror.
Wicked men have cause to be in continual terror, 33.
Testament. See Ceremonial worship.
Though in temporal things, Gods people had more particular direction then we
now, yet not in spiritual, 207. The Ministry of the New Testament is more
fruitful then that was under the law, 287 Under the law God revealed himself
to his people moresensibly and bodily, then under the Gospel, 196. The estate
of sinners is far more damnable now then it was under the law, 291.
Thanksgiving.
Of Sacrifices of Thanksgiving, 187.
Thoughts.
Conscience to be made even of them, 91.
Trouble of mind.
All men must look to be brought one day to a painful sight and sense of
sin, and of Gods anger due unto it, 42, 43. No wordly thing can content or
comfort the heart in that case, 44, 45. Means whereby they that have lost the
assurance of their salvation may recover it, 346. 347.
V.
Unity.
Unity in all points among Gods servants in this life is not to be expected,
302.
Vows.
We should in our affliction vow amendment, and perform it when we are
delivered, 405.
W.
Walking with God.
We should labor to walk with God, and how we may know whether we do so or
no, 70.
Will Worship.
No worship is to be given to God, but such as he likes of, and delights in,
even such as is done by the direction of his Word and in obedience to it, 160.
192. In will worship men serve not God, but the devil, 161. God requires more
service of every man, then he has expressly and particularly commanded him,
and yet this is no will worship, 242, 243 He that has an upright heart, will
make conscience of such things only as God has commanded or forbidden, 473.
Women.
How just causes they have to be humbled in themselves, 225. How they may
adorn the Gospel, 226.
Word of God.
No man can know God aright; but by his Word, and the difference between the
knowledge gotten so, and any other, 160, 161 It is the salvation of men, 1^8,
169. All that have it are not saved by it, 169. Salvation not to be ascribed
to any virtue that is in it, 169. By it all other means of grace are made
effectual, 169, 170. It is exceeding powerful and effectual to save men,
170, 171. We ought highly to esteem it, 172, 173. Notes to try whether we
esteem and love it indeed, 173. The wicked hardens himself in sin even by it,
98, 99. It is to be esteemed a high favor of God that we enjoy it, 162. It is
the only ground of true faith, and assurance of salvation, 338. The faith and
Religion of Gods Elect, is not grounded upon any thing, but the word only, 348,
349. 418. 419. Seek good ground in the word for that thou hold in Religion,
429. Dangerous to doubt of the truth of it, see Infidelity. The word to be
heard on week days, 241. The word to be examined, 467. Rules thereto. 499.

That only is a good work, that is commanded of God, 474.
Works of God.
Men may be prepared unto faith, and much confirmed in it by the works of God,
417. We should observe the works of God, and how God does by them ratify his

World.
By this word (sometimes) the Elect only are meant, and why Christ is called
the Savior of the world, 329, 330.
Worldly things.
No worldly thing can satisfy or comfort the soul in distress, 44, 45. It is
great folly to set our heart upon or esteem too much of any worldly comfort,
390. 438, 439. He that is truly converted makes not that reckoning of worldly
things as he did before 238.
Worship of God, See Adoration. Ceremonial Law. Exercises of Religion.
Reverence.

Most men worship not God according to his Word, 163. Reasons for the altering
of the manner of Gods worship, at Christ's coming, 190. 191 No service pleases
God, but that which is spiritual, 191, 192. He requires spiritual worship
more under the Gospel, then he did under the Law, 19^ 197. All the parts of
Gods worship, may (in some cases) be used in private houses, 120. 129. And are
as acceptable to God in one place as in another, 156. Christ himself did
diligently use to worship God in religious duties, and why, 163, 1^4. The
difference between Gods worship under the Law and under the Gospel, ^87, 1^.
189. God requires bodily worship of us as well as spiritual, but not so much
as under the law, 189, 190. Even the wicked est men that live are bound to
worship God, 195.

THE FIRST LECTURE, ON IANVARIE XXXI. MDCVIII.
IOH. IIII. X. Jesus answered, and said unto her; If thou knew that gift of
God; and who it is that says to thee, give me to drink; thou would have
asked of him, and he would have given thee, living water.


THE occasion of these words, and the dependence they have upon that which went
before, is this; Our Savior hearing that John was imprisoned by Herod, and
foreseeing that they that had prevailed thus far against John, would now
also Mar. 1. 14.
practice against himself, (because he knew the Pharisees had heard, that he
had made and baptized more Disciples then John; to prevent this danger, Ver. 1.
and that he might not be interrupted in his ministry, before he had finished
his course) he fled, and left Judea, and departed into Galile, because (though
Herod that had imprisoned John, was Tetrarch of Galile; yet) the Pharisees (who
had the Ver 3. Luke 3. 1.
chief hand in John's troubles) were not so strong there, as in Judea, and
about Jerusalem. Now in his journey from Judea into Galile, he went through
Samaria, (not of set purpose to teach the Samaritans, for as he forbad his
Disciples when he sent them forth to preach, to enter into the Cities of the
Samaritans, and bad them go only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel;
so he says Mat. 10. 5, 6.
of himself, that he was not sent, but unto the lost sheep of the house of
Israel) but by occasion only: because it lay directly in his way, from that
part of Judea Mat. 15. 34.
(where he was) into Galile; and therefore the Evangelist says, He must needs
go through Samaria. As he passed through that country; he came to Sychar a
City of Samaria, that was famous in sundry respects, for Jacob had Luke 9. 52.
Ver. 4.
dwelt there, and given to Joseph his best beloved Son, his possession near
unto it; and dug a Well, which to this day remained, and bare the name of
Jacobs Well. Upon this Well our Savior sat him down; both because he Ver. 6.
was weary with travail; and also because he was a thirst; and it was about
noone. For (to show himself to be very man, and how he was content to take on
him the form of a servant, and debase himself for our sakes) he took our
nature with all the infirmities thereof (excepting sin,) and was (as it
seems) even more wearied and weakened with travel, and more thirsty also
then his Disciples were; for they were able to go further into the City without
resting themselves or desiring water. As he was sitting thus upon the Well, to
rest, cool, and refresh himself, There came a woman of Samaria to draw Ver. 7.
water; and he asks her some to drink. Not so much because he did thirst
after drink (though indeed he did so, as has been said) for he knew before
she spoke what she would answer him, and how she would deny him as because he
thirsted after the salvation of this wretched woman; and would take occasion
hereby, to confer with her, and to instruct her. For so soon as he was
entered into conference, he forgets his thirst, and desires no more any
water of her. Now the Evangelist says, the occasion he took to ask her
water, was this, that his Disciples (whose service he might have used for the
drawing of him some water) were gone into the City to buy meat. Ver. 8.
For our Savior (though he had no house and land of his own) yet he lived not
by begging, nor of mere alms, but had money of his own, which his hearers
and friends bestowed on him. The woman perceiving (both by his speech and
apparel) that he was a Jew; gives him no water; but wondereth; that he being
a Jew, should ask any of her being a Samaritan, and gives this for the reason
why she wondered; because such was the mortal hatred that the Jews did bear
to the Samaritans (partly by reason of their difference in Religion, and partly
because of the old injuries that they had received from them) as that the Jews
meddled not at all, nor would have any dealing with the Samaritans. Hereupon
follow the words that I have now read unto you, wherein our Savior does
neither reject her in wrath, (for being so void of humanity, as not to give a
little water to one that asked it in his need) nor answers directly her
question; nor importuneth her further for water; but gently reproves her; yet
not for denying water, but for not making that use of him she should have done,
and takes occasion thereby, to discourse unto her of another manner of water,
that he had to bestow upon her; which she would have asked of him, if she had
known him. But yet because he would draw her on to further speech, and stir
up in her a desire to question and inquire of him; he does not in plain terms
deliver his meaning to her, but in a parable, as if he should have said thus
unto her; Thou take me to be an ordinary Jew, and therefore refusest to
gratify me in this small thing; but if thou knew me well, and what a gift
the Lord makes offer of unto thee, and all his people, in sending me into the
world; thou would have esteemed of me better then thou do; thou would
have thought thy self not good enough to have given me water; but would
have begged of me, and I would have given thee a better and far more
excellent kind of water then this is, that I have desired of thee.

Now there are in these words three principal things to be observed.

1. What it was that he had to bestow on her, and which he was desirous to have
bestowed on her, water of life, by which (though in the letter he means
spring water, for so she understood him, and so is this word used, Genesis 26. 19.
Isaaks servants dug in Gerar a Well of living water, yet thereby) as by a
Metaphor he meant the Spirit of God.

2. What her duty was to have done, and how she might have obtained this water
of life, She should have asked it, and he would have given it her.

3. What the cause was, why she asked it not, She knew not Christ whom he
calls here that gift of God, and who was the person that now spoke unto her.

The first thing then that offers it self in these words to our
consideration is this, that our Savior calls the spirit of regeneration,
water of life. For that he means this of the Spirit, it is evident both by
that which he says, ver. 14. (where also we shall have more fit occasion to
inquire why he calls it, Spring water, or water of Life) and more plainly,
Ioh. 7. 38, 39. Where when he had said, He that belieueth in me, out of his
belly shall flow rivers of water of life, in the next verse the Evangelist
interprets him thus, This spoke he of the spirit; from thence then we have
this to learn.

That the Spirit of God, in what heart soever it dwells, is in effect and
operation like unto water. For the proof of this, all those places might be
Doct. 1.
brought, where the Spirit of God is compared unto water: but I will content my
self with one or two, Esa. 44. 3. the promise which in the beginning of the
verse is made, I will power water upon the thirsty, and floods upon the dry
ground, is interpreted thus in the latter end of the same verse, I will power
my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thy buds; So Ioh. 3. 5. Unless a
man be borne again of water and the spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom
of God. In which respect also it is used in Baptism, to signify, not only
the blood of Christ, but the spirit of regeneration also.

The reason is the great similitude that is between the Spirit of God and water
in effect and operation: which may be discerned principally in four points.
Reason.


First, whereas before a man be regenerate, the Lord is to him, and in his
apprehension, as a consuming fire, as the Apostle speaks, Heb. 12. 29. He
never 1.
thinks seriously of him, and of his appearing before him, but he is troubled
and ready to say with them, Esa. 33. 14. Who among us shall dwell with the
devouring fire? the Spirit of God, and nothing but it, (like water) allayeth
this heat, cools and refreshes the soul of man; for by it, the love of God
is shed abroad in our hearts, as the Apostle speaks, Romans 5. 5. and the blood
of Christ is effectually applied and sprinkled upon the conscience.

Secondly, whereas before a man be regenerate, he is (like unto the dropsy 2.
man) in a continual thirst; or like him that has the disease which is called
the dogs hunger, never satisfied, never contented: the Spirit of God (like
water) quenches this thirst, and satisfies the soul of man, by it the hungry
soul is filled with good things, as the blessed Virgin speaks, Luke 1. 53.
by it the soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness. As David speaks,
Psalm. 63. 3. This (by the assurance that it gives to the heart of the favor
of God in Christ) works that contentment in it, as it makes a man able to
say, as Jacob did when he heard that Joseph was alive, Genesis 45. 28. It is
enough. He that has once received the spirit of grace (which is the pledge and
earnest of our eternal inheritance) will be able (out of full contentedness
of mind) to glory with David, Psalm. 16. 6. The lines are fallen to me in
pleasant places, yea I have a goodly heritage.

And whereas nothing so much hinders the tranquillity of our minds, as the
immoderate desire of worldly things; the Spirit of God slaketh that thirst, and
insatiable desire; and teaches us to be contented with a little. A little
wealth, a little pleasure, a little credit will content us when we have this
spirit. Therefore when Paul had said, that Godliness with contentment (that is,
which always makes a man content with his own estate) is great gain, 1 Timothy
6. 6. he tells us immediately how mean a state a man will be content with, if
he be godly indeed: if we have food and raiment, (says he) v. 8. So that, he
that has the spirit of grace, uses not these earthly things, with that thirst
and greedy appetite, that other men do; but with more sobriety and
indifferency of mind. Using, but not ouer-using them, 1. Cor. 7. 31. using them
so, as he can want them, if need be. I may do all things (says Paul, 1 Cor. 6.
12.) but I will not be brought under the power of any thing. and Phil. 4. 11.
12. I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content, I know how
to be abased, etc.

Thirdly, whereas a man before he be regenerate, is filthy and unclean, his
words unclean, Mat. 15. 18 his best actions unclean, Pro. 15. 5. but his
heart 3.
especially more filthy then any sink, Ier. 17. 9. yea so filthy, that as he
that was unclean under the Law, made every thing he touched unclean, Number. 19.
22. yea though the thing were otherwise holy, Hag. 2. 14. so is it in this
case, Tit. 1. 15. Unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure.
And thus filthy is the unregenerate man, not in the Lords eyes only, as the
Lord speaks, Zach. 11. 8. My soul loathed them; and in the eyes of every
good man, Pro. 29. 27. An unjust man is an abomination to the just, but even in
his own eyes also, when God shall be pleased to open them. Insomuch as the man
that takes most pride in himself, if the Lord should lay him naked to
himself, would loath, and abhor himself, as Job says he did, Job. 42. 6.

If the Lord should break up that sink that is in him, he would not be able to
abide himself; as in that fearful example of Judas, Mat. 27. 4, 5. we may
plainly see.

Now where the Spirit of God comes, it (like water) cleanses all things; it
makes the heart clean, the tongue clean, the whole man clean, The fear of
the Lord is clean, says David, Psalm. 19. 9. and Ezekiel. 36. that which is said,
verse. 25. I will power clean water upon you, and you shall be clean, is thus
expounded, verse. 26. 27. A new heart will I give you, and a new spirit will I
put within you, I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
statutes. The Spirit of God is this clean water that makes us clean.

Fourthly, whereas a man before his regeneration, is as barren and unfruitful,
as any desert, and thereunto compared, Esa. 32. 15. 16. yea as unable to 4.
do, speak or move to any thing that is good, as a dead man is, Ephesians. 2. 1.
Altogether unprofitable, not one that does good, no not one, as the Apostle
speaks, Romans 3. 12. Where the Spirit of God comes, (like water) it makes the
heart fruitful unto God, it makes our desert like Eden, and our wilderness
like to the garden of the Lord, as the Prophet speaks, Esa. 51. 3. Insomuch as
though every one that has the Spirit of God, be not in the like measure
fruitful, (for in the good ground the seed brings forth in some but thirty, in
some sixty, in some an hundred fold, Mar. 4. 8.) yet every one is fruitful in
some measure: yea able to bring forth his own fruit in due season, as the
Prophet speaks, Psalm. 1. 3. Able, not only to wish well, and have good
motions; but to speak, and do well also.

He that was lame before, shall leap as an Heart, and the tongue of him that
was dumb before shall sing, Esa. 35. 6. yea the Spirit of God makes him that
has it, able even in the time of heat (of persecution) to continue fruitful,
as the tree planted by the waters, that spreads out her roots by the river,
which shall not see when heat comes, but her leaf shall be green, and shall
not be careful in the year of drought, neither cease from yielding fruit,
Ier. 17. 8.

This Doctrine serves for a touchstone for every one to try himself by: we
Use.
all profess that we are baptized, and so washed with this water, even borne
again of water and of the holy Ghost, Ioh. 3. 5. without which we shall be as
much the better for our outward Baptism; as the wicked Egyptians were, by the
Red Sea which was a type of it, 1 Co. 10. 2. (that which was the means of
safety and escape unto Gods people, was a means of utter perdition unto them,
Neh. 9. 11,) and as they are, for the Lords Supper, that receive it unworthily,
He that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation unto
himself, (says the Apostle) 1 Corinthians. 11. 29. We profess we have the Spirit
of God (and indeed our case is most miserable without it. If any man have not
the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his, Romans 8. 9.) Let us try our selves by
this Doctrine. If the Spirit of God be in thee indeed, thou shall discern it
by these four effects, wherein it is like unto water. 1. It will pacify thy
conscience, and free thee from the slavish fear of God, and of his wrath. 2.
It will breed contentment in thy mind, by abating in thee the immoderate desire
of earthly things. 3. It will cleanse thy heart and life from that filthiness
wherewith before thou were defiled. 4. It will make thee fruitful unto God,
meet for thy Masters use, and prepared unto every good work, as the Apostle
speaks, 2 Timothy 2. 21.

But of the uses that this Doctrine serves unto, we shall have occasion to
speak further upon the 14. verse.

Lecture the second, Feb. 7. 1608.
Follows now the second part of this text, viz. What this woman should have
done, and how she might have obtained this Water of life, she should have
asked of him, and he would have given it her. If she had known him aright, she
would have asked it, and he blames her for not asking it; and if she had asked
it (though she were a Samaritan, and one that for so many years to this
present had lived in so great sin) yet would he have given it her.

Where we have first to learn. That it is not only the duty of every one
Doct. 2.
that would be saved, and obtain Gods grace, to ask it; but it is also the
property of all that God means to save, to beg grace of God: Look whom God
purposes to bestow his grace and salvation upon, they shall desire it
unfeignedly, and ask it of him. Every man must ask and cry for grace; every man
shall certainly do it, whom God intends to save. I shall best confirm this
Doctrine, by answering that which our profane hearts are apt to object against
it.

No man can desire grace till he have received Gods Spirit, 2 Cor. 3. 5. We Ob.
1.
are not sufficient of our selves to think any thing that is good.

I answer, that this is true indeed; but yet this is the first work of Gods
Spirit, in those whom he means to save: he works in them a feeling of the
Answ.
need they have of grace, and makes them able to cry to him for it. He first
makes them poor in spirit, and mourners, meek also and humble for that their
poverty, and then he breeds in them an hunger and thirst after righteousness,
as we may see in that Gradation Christ uses, Mat. 5. 3. 6. He powers upon
them the spirit of grace and of supplications as the Prophet speaks, Zach.
12. 10. The spirit of grace, so soon as it enters into the heart (so soon as
the work of grace is begun in a man) it makes him plentiful and abundant in
supplicating and suing unto God for mercy and grace. Because ye are sons,
(says the Apostle, Gal 4. 6.) God has sent forth the spirit of his Son into
your hearts; and how does the Spirit first show himself to be entered into our
hearts? surely by his crying Abba Father; that is, by making us cry to God as
to our Father for mercy and grace.

The Lord knows our case well enough, and what we need, to what purpose then
should we thus pray? Your Father knows what things ye have need Ob. 2.
of, before you ask him, (says our Savior) Mat. 6. 8.

I answer: that is a good reason indeed against vain babbling, when (as if we
had to deal with a man, that cannot know our desires, but by our words) we
Answ.
are more abundant in words then in affection. But though God know our wants
before we ask, yet he wills us, to make by prayer our desires known to him,
even as if he were otherwise ignorant of them. In every thing (says the
Apostle, Phil. 4. 6.) Let your requests be made known unto God, by prayer and
supplication. Yea, he has conditioned thus with us, that if we would have any
good thing from him, we must pray for it. Ask and it shall be given you, says
our Savior, Mat. 7. 7. and Ier. 33. 3. Call unto me and I will answer thee,
and show thee great and mighty things which thou know not, Pro. 2. 3, 5. If
thou call after knowledge and criest for understanding, then shall thou
understand the fear of the Lord.

The Lord has determined in his eternal Counsel who shall be saved, and Ob.
3.
who shall have grace. He works all things after the Counsel of his own
will, says the Apostle, Ephesians. 1. 11. And my prayer cannot alter his purpose:
God is not as man, that he should repent, says Samuel, 1 Samuel 15. 29.

I answer: that as God has determined who shall be saved and attain to Answ.
grace, so has he decreed this to be the means, whereby they shall attain to
grace and salvation. So that by this a man shall know, whether God have
purposed to save him, if he give him an heart to cry to him for it, Ezekiel. 36.
37. When the Lord had declared how he had decreed the return of his people
from captivity; He adds, I will yet for this be sought of the children of
Israel to perform it unto them. And Ier. 29. When the Lord had promised them
Verse 11. I know the thoughts that I have thought toward you, even the thoughts
of peace, and not of trouble, to give you an end, and your hope; he adds,
that when the time of their visitation should come, that he should execute and
perform his decree unto them, ver. 12. Then shall ye cry unto me, and you
shall go and pray unto me. So that even as a man cannot, nor may not presume to
search into Gods Counsel, till himself be pleased to reveal it, nor give
any guess, what God has decreed concerning him, till he begin to execute his
decree: Deuteronomy. 29. 29. The secret things belong unto the Lord; so can no man say
that God has purposed his salvation, till he give him an heart unfeignedly to
desire it.

The Lord is not of that disposition men are of, who will not give unless they
be asked; He is far more gracious and bountiful, and gives to them Ob. 4.
that never asked, Esaias 65. 1. I am found of them that sought me not.

I answer: that indeed we can never seek to him for grace, till he by his
Spirit of grace begin effectually to call us; but when the hour once comes,
Answ.
that God has determined to execute the decree of our election, and to call
us, the first grace he works in us, is the Spirit of supplication, as we
heard before. Therefore it is said in the same place, Esaias 65. 1. I have been
sought of them that asked not. Though we had no ability nor mind to ask grace
of him before, yet then he makes us to seek to him for it. And though the Lord
be of a bountiful and gracious disposition, yet uses he (in spiritual things
especially) not to be bountiful to any but to those, unto whom he gives grace
to seek to him: and is not this bounty sufficient? Moses speaking of Gods
marvelous goodness to his Church, expresses it thus, Deuteronomy. 4. 7. What nation
is so great unto whom the gods came so near unto them, as the Lord our God is
near unto us in all things that we call unto him for. So David sets forth
the plenteousnesse of Gods goodness and mercy by this, Psalm. 86. 5. Thou Lord
art good and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy, unto all them that call
upon thee. And Paul speaking of Gods bounty, says, Romans 10. 12. He that is
Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him.

The Reasons why none can look for grace and mercy from God, but those that
ask for it, why he will be sought unto for it, are three. Reason.


The first of them respects the Lord himself and his glory, for God counts
himself greatly honored, when his people pray unto him, and depend 1.
upon him; as it is an honor to a man on earth, to be much sought unto, and to
have men rely wholly upon him. This the faithful knew well, and have by this
consideration been provoked to this duty. Therefore David says, Psalm. 63. 4.
I will magnify thee all my life, and lift up my hands in thy name; when he
lifted up his hands unto God he magnified him: and Psalm. 66. 17. I called unto
him with my mouth, and he was exalted with my tongue. He esteemed (doubtless)
meanly enough of his own prayers though he thus spoke; but he knew that God
accounts himself to be highly exalted and honored by this, when his
servants thus seek unto him. In which respect also the Church voweth this to
God, as a duty whereby she knew God accounted himself to be much honored,
Psalm. 80. 18. Quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.

The second respects the benefit we receive by it; for by praying, our faith,
repentance, love and zeal is exercised; and as the strength and vigor 2.
of our bodies, is by exercise maintained and increased; so is grace also
increased by exercise, Jude 20. But ye beloved, edify your selves in your most
holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost. By exercising our faith, and repentance,
and love, in prayer, we shall edify our selves.

The third respects the nature of grace, for he that once has but the least
measure of a true taste of it, will esteem it above all things in the world, 3.
and therefore cannot choose but earnestly desire more of it, and he that does
not desire it, contemns it. He that has found the true treasure, and ioyeth
in it; will sell all that he has to purchase it, Mat. 13. 44. 2. Every
blessing is the sweeter to the godly, and certainer token of Gods love; if they
can feel they have obtained it by prayer. David gives this for the reason of
his thankfulness, and why Gods mercy in his deliverance was so sweet unto him,
why he would extol the Lord for it, Psalm. 30. 2. because he obtained it by his
prayer. O Lord my God (says he) I cried unto thee, and thou have healed me. 3.
Yea though they obtain it not, they can bear the want of it the better, if
they know they have prayed for it, Phil. 4. 6. 7. In every thing by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God, and
the peace of God which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and
minds through Christ Jesus.

The Use of this Doctrine is, first, to exhort every man to four duties.

1. Labor for an unfeigned desire of grace; for till this, thou can never
have any assurance of thy salvation, nor receive any grace from God: Luke Use 1.
1. 53. He fills the hungry with good things, and the rich he sends empty
away.

2. Labor for the Spirit of prayer and supplication; for without this thou
can receive no good thing from God, specially no grace, James 4. 7. Ye have
not, because ye ask not.

3. In the best means, cry and pray to God for grace; else shall they not
profit thee. Thus did David, though he enjoyed excellent means of grace, Psalm.
25. 4. 5. Show me thy ways O Lord, teach me thy paths, lead me in thy truth,
and teach me. and 119. 12. 33. Teach me thy statutes: teach me O Lord the way
of thy statutes.

4. If thou ever had this desire, this Spirit of supplication, and feel it
decayed in thee, oh stir it up again, and strive to recover it; and herein I
may say to thee, as the Apostle to them, Heb. 10. 32. Call to remembrance the
former days; and as our Savior to the Angel of the Church of Ephesus, Reu.
2. 5. Remember (even in this) from whence thou art fallen and repent. For as
your desire of grace decays, so does your assurance and comfort decay.

Secondly, this doctrine serves to reprove the wicked, and show the fearful
estate of such as are void of all desire of salvation, Psalm. 119. 154.
Salvation 2.
is far from the wicked, for they seek not thy statutes. Certainly thou art
yet in thy sins, in the state of a child of wrath. If thou say well, if God
have decreed to save me, I shall do well enough: I answer, thou presumptuous
fool, what have thou to do with Gods secrets, Deutr. 29. 29. while thou
continuest with^t all desire of grace, thou have cause to fear thou art a
reprobate.

But we shall make the better use of this Doctrine, when we have learned the
doctrine that follows.

We are therefore further to observe, that as Christ tells her, what she
should have done to obtain this water of life, she should have asked; so he
tells her also what he would have done if she had asked, he would have given
it her: though she were a Samaritan, and a most wicked woman also.

Whence we learn, That all such as can unfeignedly desire and ask grace Doct.
3.
of God, shall be sure to obtain it. See the express promises of God for
this: Mat. (...). 6. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after
righteousness, for they shall be filled. Mat. 7. 8. Every one that asks
receives, and he that seeks finds, and to him that knocks it shall be
opened. Romans 10. 13. Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be
saved. Reu. 22. 17. Let him that is a thirst come. And whosoever will, let him
take the water of life freely.

The reasons of this are three. Reason.


1. The infinite goodness of the Lord, and the earnest desire he has of 1.
the salvation and conversion of men. See this here in Christ; he labors to
work this desire of the water of life in this wretched woman. So Esaias 65. 1.
Behold me, behold, etc. and so ver. 2. I have spread out my hands all the day
unto a disobedient people. Can he then reject them that unfeignedly desire his
grace, who is himself so earnest a suitor to us that we would seek and
receive it.

2. The delight God takes in, and the readiness that is in him to accept of
the prayers, and to grant the requests of his servants, Psalm. 145. 19. He will
2.
fulfill the desire of them that fear him, he also will hear their cry and
will save them; specially the prayers they make for spiritual things. The
speech pleased the Lord that Solomon asked this thing, 1. Kin. 3. 10. and Luke
11. 13. How much more shall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them
that ask him? as if he should say, that is a gift which you may be sure to
obtain if you beg it, and which is meet for your heavenly Father to give.
Insomuch as the Lords manner has been to meet his servants as it were in the
midway whom he has seen coming toward him this way, and to prevent them,
Esa. 65. 24. Yea before they call I will answer and while they are yet
speaking, I will hear. As the Father of the Prodigal did, Luke 15. 20. When
he was yet a great way off, he saw him, and had compassion on him, and ran, etc.

3. He that desires grace must needs have the spirit, for this desire cannot
come of nature, Phil. 2. 13. It is God that works in you both to will and to
do, of 3.
his own good pleasure. Yea this is a singular grace, Ye have begun (says the
Apostle, 2 Cor. 8. 10,) not only to do, but also to be willing; making it a
greater grace to be willing and desirous to do well, then it is to do the thing
that is good, and thereupon infers verse 12. If there be first a willing
mind, a man is accepted according to that he has, and not according to that he
has not. Yea, this is almost all that the faithful have, many times to
comfort themselves withal, that they find in themselves an unfeigned desire to
please God. This was all that Nehemiah could say of himself, and the rest of
his brethren, Neh. 1. 11. that they did desire to fear Gods name. And the
Church, Esa. 26. 8. The desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the
remembrance of thy holiness; and Verse. 9. with my soul have I desired thee in
the night. This was Paul's comfort Romans 7. 18. To will is present with me. They
must needs be sure therefore of grace, that have an unfeigned desire of it, for
they have it already. No man can unfeignedly desire faith, that has not faith,
nor repentance, that has not repented, etc.

This Doctrine serves, first for the comfort of such as mourn in Sion,
because of their great want of grace. Their faith, knowledge, hatred of sin,
etc. Use 1.
are so weak, that they cannot discern them, and therefore doubt, they are
not in the state of grace. Let such for their comfort apply this doctrine to
themselves. Thou desire nothing in the world more then Gods favor and grace;
thou mournest for the want of it; Be of good comfort, God accepts graciously
of this unfeigned desire. Remember to thy comfort, Christ will not quench the
smoking flax, Mat. 12. 20. Remember how he accepted the weak faith of that
poor man, Mar. 9. 24. the truth whereof appeared most in a desire to believe.

They that can but sobbe unto God unfeignedly, have the Spirit of prayer, though
they know not what to pray as they ought, Romans 8. 26. 27. This thy desire is a
certain sign thou art in the state of grace, and that thou shall increase in
grace also. To every one that has (and by exercising it, does show that he
has any measure of true grace) shall be given (says our Savior, Mat. 25.
29.) and he shall have abundance. And though thou do not yet, thou shall be
sure one day to find comfort, according to that prophetical prayer of David,
Psalm. 40. 16. which also implies a promise in it, Let all those that seek
thee, be glad and rejoice in thee.

For exhortation unto two duties. 1. That what grace soever any of us 2.
want, wherein we find our selves most weak, and defective (as who feels not
in himself many defects?) we should seek (with faith and confidence) to draw
it out of the walls of salvation (as the Prophet speaks, Esa. 12. 3.) by this
bucket of hearty prayer. 2. Be in thy prayers more earnest and plentiful for
heavenly, then for earthly blessings. For first, no prayer pleases God so
well. Secondly, In no prayer thou can have so much assurance to prevail. 3.
This is the readiest and surest way, even to obtain earthly blessings; if thou
can seek heavenly first and more earnestly: according to that promise, Mat.
6. 33. First seek the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these
things shall be added unto yon.

For the reproof and terror of ungodly men. First, Is there not so much in
thee as unfeignedly to desire Gods grace, and thine own salvation? then art 3.
thou certainly quite void of all grace; and consequently, in a most miserable
estate. For the smallest measure of true grace, that can be in a man, is to
hunger after grace in the want thereof. Secondly, This discovers the
fearful estate of all such as shall perish everlastingly; They must needs be
all inexcusable that perish, because they did not so much as desire salvation,
nay, (like profane Esaus) they contemned it: The Lord would have saved them,
and they would not; as Christ complains of the Jews, Mat. 23. 37. Insomuch
as, in the day of the Lord, the father shall not pity his own child that is
damned, nor the child his own father, but even in this that shall be fulfilled
in that day which the Prophet speaks in another case, Psalm. 58. 10. The
righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance.

But against all that has been said of this point, it may be objected, that
this is a hard and absurd Doctrine, may any man be saved that will, that
desires Object.
salvation? is there any man so mad that would not be saved? Do we not read of
Balaans, Numb. 23. 10. and of sundry others, Mat. 7. 2^. and 25. 11. Luke 13.
24. that have desired to be saved, and yet have perished everlastingly?

I answer, it is true; and I say further, that if every one that has a kind of
desire to be saved, might come to heaven, there would be but a few in hell.
Answ.
But this I say also, that none of all those have missed of salvation, or of
saving grace that have desired it unfeignedly.

Five differences may be observed between the desires of those men, whose
examples have been objected, and the desires of Gods children.

1. They desire it not unfeignedly, because they desire it not earnestly: for
they will take no pains to obtain it, nor use the means with any diligence:
Pro. 13. 4. The sluggard lusts, but his soul has naught; and 21. 25. The
desire of the slothfall slays him, for his hands refuse to work. They will
forgo nothing for it. The rich Ruler seemed earnestly to desire salvation,
Mar. 10. 17. but indeed he did not; there were other things he loved much
better. When a man will pretend a desire to be saved, and yet will not leave
his whoring, drunkenness, swearing, profaning the Sabbath, but hates to be
reformed in these, and such like things, shall we say he does unfeignedly desire
it? No, no; they that seek him with their whole heart, will work none
iniquity, but walk in his ways; says David, Psalm, 119. 2, 3. Contrarily, the
godlies desire is earnest, Ye shall seek me, and find me (says the Lord, Ier.
29. 13.) when ye shall search for me with all your heart.

2. They desire it not unfeignedly, because they desire it not constantly, but
as by fits of an ague, and flashes of lightning: All their goodness is (as the
Prophet speaks, Hos. 6. 4.) as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goes
away. Contrarily, the godlies desire is constant: My soul breaks (says
David, Psalm. 119. 20.) for the longing that it has to thy judgments at all
times.

3. They desire it not unfeignedly, because they desire it not seasonably, but
put it off till the day of salvation, and time God has set for their
conversion, be past, when the Master of the house is risen up, and has shut to
the door, (as our Savior speaks, Luke 13. 25.) Whereas that which a man
desires unfeignedly and earnestly, he will seek presently and without delay.
He, whose soul thirsts after God, will seek him early, as David speaks,
Psalm. 63. 1. The Kingdom of God must be sought in the first place, Mat. 6. 33.

4. They desire it not unfeignedly, because they desire it only out of the
slavish fear of God, and of his wrath, When their fear comes as a
desolation, and their destruction like a Whirlewind, (says Solomon, Pro. 1.
27. 28.) then they call upon God, but he will not answer them, they seek him
early, but find him not: Whereas, the godly desire it out of love to God, and
his grace principally, as David did so earnestly desire to dwell in Gods house,
that he might behold the beauty of the Lord, Psalm. 27. 4. And out of the love
he bare to him for his goodness.

5. They desire mercy, but not grace, and freedom from their misery, which is
the fruit of their sin, rather then from their sin, which is the root of
their misery: They choose iniquity rather then affliction, as Elihu speaks, Job
36. 21. Whereas the godly desires as well grace, and power to repent, and to be
delivered from the power of sin, as mercy and favor for the pardon of his
sin. So did David, Psalm. 51. 10. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and
renew a right Spirit within me. Hearken unto me (says the Prophet, Esa. 51.
1.) Ye that follow after righteousness, Ye that seek the Lord. No man seeks
the Lord and his favor aright, but he only that follows after, that is,
does earnestly and with his whole endeavor, seek and desire to lead a godly
life.

Lecture the third, Feb. 14. 1608. JOHN IIII. X.
Follows now the third part of the Text, viz. what the reason was, she begged
not of Christ this water of life: She knew not that gift of God, and who it was
that said unto her give me drink. By that gift of God, he means himself,
(as shall appear in the Doctrine;) and the words following are an explication
of these words. As if he should say, If thou knew that gift of God, that is,
if thou knew who it is that says unto thee, give me drink, if thou knew
me, thou would have asked, etc.

In the words three things are to be observed.

1. That he calls himself that gift of God.

2. That he says, the cause why she asked not the water of life of him, was
for that she knew him not.

3. That he says, if she had known him, she would have asked it of him.

First then, in that our Savior calls himself that gift of God, we learn,
That Christ is a gift of God, yea the chief, the greatest gift, the principal
fruit of Doct. 4.
his favor that ever God gave unto men. Many other excellent gifts he has
bestowed on men. A wonderful token of Gods love to man it is, that he made all
the creatures (whereof many are far more glorious and excellent then
himself) for his use. This David (when he considered it) wondered at, Psalm. 8.
1. 9. So the comfortable use of his creatures, and that gladness of heart, he
gives us, in the enjoying of them, filling our hearts with food and gladness,
as the Apostle speaks, Acts 14. 17. Is also a great gift of God, and so
Solomon calls it, Eccl. 5. 18. And yet a greater gift then these it is, that he
makes us partakers of the divine nature, and gives us his spirit: The Apostle
calls this an unspeakable gift, that the Corinthians were able to yield a
voluntary submission to the Gospel; and to give chearefully for the relief of
the poor Saints, 2 Cor. 9. 15. And David, when he saw how willingly the people
had offered to the building of the Temple, wonders at this grace and gift of
God bestowed on them, 1. Chro. 29. 14. Who am I (says he) and what is my
people that we should be able to offer willingly after this sort? In a word,
the gifts of God upon man, and the tokens of his favor to him are so many and
so great, as no man is able to express them, Psalm 40. 5. O Lord my God (says
David) thou have made thy wonderful works so many, that none can count in
order to thee thy thoughts toward us: I would declare and speak of them, but
they are more then I am able to express.

Yet are none of them worthy to be named in comparison of this gift: the giving
of his own Son to us, is a far more excellent gift, and token of his love,
then all the rest. When the Prophet had spoken of the great joy of Gods people,
Esa. 9 3. They have rejoiced before thee, according to the joy of harvest, as
men rejoice when they divide a spoil: He gives the reason of this joy, Verse
6. For to us a Child is borne, to us a Son is given. So the Apostle comparing
Christ, and the benefits we receive by him, with Adam, and the damage we
sustain by him: Romans 5. Calls Christ often the gift of God, Verse 15. The gift
is not so as the offense, for if through the offense of one many be dead, much
more that grace of God, and the gift by grace: which is by one man, Jesus
Christ, has abounded unto many. And Verse 17. For if through the offense of
one, death reigned through one, etc. So our Savior himself speaks of this,
as of the greatest love that ever God showed or could show unto man: Ioh. 3.
16. God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son. And the
Apostle John, 1 Ioh. 4. 9. In this appeared the love of God toward us, because
God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through
him: and Ver. 10. Herein is love, not that we loved him, but that he loved us,
and sent his Son to be a reconciliation for our sins.

The reasons, whereby this may appear to be the greatest gift that ever God
gave man, are three.

1. In respect of the Lords affection toward us, declared in this gift.

2. Of the benefit we receive by this gift, and the fruits and consequents of
it.

3. The freeness of this gift. For the first, though Christ were more worth
then ten thousand worlds, being in the form of God, and one that thought it no
robbery to be equal with God, Phil. 2. 6. Though he were infinitely dearer to
his Father, then any of our children can be to us. Mat. 12. 18. His beloved, in
whom his soul delighted. I was daily his delight (says he, Proverb. 8. 30.)
Yet (as if we were of more worth and dearer unto him, then his only begotten
Son) he gave him for us, and that he might express his love to us, he
neglected him as it were, and withdrew his affection from him, Romans 8. 32. He
spared not his own Son: He caused him to take upon him the form of a
servant, and to be of no reputation; Phil. 2. 7. to make us Kings, Apoc. 1. 6.
2 Cor. 8. 9. He being rich, for our sakes became poor, that we through his
poverty might be made rich. So that in this, it may seem God has respected
and loved us above his own Son. 2. He caused him to be tempted by Satan, for
forty days together, and that in the wilderness, (a place of great terror)
Mark. 1. 17. And surely this was a far greater indignity, and reproach to be
done to him, then it would be, to the greatest Empress in the world, that she
should be solicited, by the basest scullion or rogue in a kingdom, to commit
filthiness with him: yea, he permitted him so far to the power of Satan:
that he in those forty days carried the precious body of the Son of God, up
and down at his pleasure: one while to the top of an high mountain, Luke 4.
5. Another while to a pinnacle of the Temple, Luke 4. 9. And why did he thus
give his own Son over thus far to the power of Satan? Surely to deliver
us from the power of Satan: Hebrews 2. 15. So that in this respect also it
may seem, he has respected and loved us more then his own Son. 3. He
powered shame and contempt upon him, greater then ever any creature endured. In
his life often he endured great contempt, but specially in his death, he died the
shameful death of the cross; hanged between two thieues; both before and
after his execution, so many reproaches and contempts were done to him, as no
Chronicle can remember the like ever done to any malefactor: The whole band of
the soldiers being called together, clothed him with purple; platted a crown
of thorns, and put it about his head; and began to salute him, Hail King of
the Jews: and smit him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and
bowing their knees, worshipped him (as the holy Evangelist records, Mar. 15.
16. 19) We have known many notorious traitors and other malefactors executed,
(as for example, the gunpowder-traitors, in whose death all good subjects had
cause to rejoice) but did you ever know any so reproched and insulted over in
their death, as Christ was? In which respect, the Prophet says of him, Esa.
53. 2. He had no form nor beauty, he was despised and rejected of men, we hid
as it were our faces from him, he was despised and we esteemed him not: and
himself complained in the person of David (that was a type of him) Psalm. 22.
6. I am a worm and not a man, a shame of men, and the contempt of the people.
And why did God power this contempt on his own Son? Surely to deliver us from
that shame and confusion that did justly belong unto us, To us belongs
confusion of face, (O Lord) to us belongs confusion of face, (says the
Prophet) Dan. 9. 7, 8. So that in this also it may seem the Lord has
respected and loved us above his own Son.

4. He made him to be sin which knew no sin, 2 Cor. 5. 21. As if from the
soale of his foot to the crown of his head, nothing had been whole on him,
but wounds and swellings, and sores full of corruption, as the Prophet speaks
in another case, Esa. 1. 6. imputing to him, and (as it were) clothing him with
all the drunkennesses, adulteries, murders, blasphemies, of all the Elect,
througout the world. And why did he thus make him sin? surely to make us free
from all sin, thas we might be made the righteousness of God in him, 2 Cor.
5. 21. So that in this also it may seem the Lord has respected and loved us
more then him.

5. Lastly, he made him a curse for us, Gal. 3. 13. so as (for a time) nothing
could be seen on him, but the curse of God; no sign of his favor at all. He
was in the garden in such sorrow and fear, as that he was feign to desire
poor weak men to watch with him, Mat. 26. 36. and that he shed many tears,
cried out and roared with strong cries, Heb. 5. 7. and sweat water and blood,
Luke. 23. 44. and upon the Cross, the curse of God was so heavy upon him, that
he cried, Mat. 27. 46. My God, my God why have thou forsaken me? so that that
which is said in another case, of the Church, Lam. 1. 12. that might our
Savior have said at that time, Behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto
my sorrow which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord has afflicted me in the
day of his fierce wrath. And why was he thus accursed? Surely he was made a
curse for us, that the blessing of Abraham might come upon us, says the
Apostle. Gal. 3. 13, 14. he endured the sorrows and terrors of hell, that we
might be brought to the joys of heaven. So that in this also, it may seem,
the Lord has respected and loved us more then his own Son.

Let no man think, that I have strayned my self, to amplify this matter more
then needed; no, if I had The tongues of men and Angels, I were not able,
suficiently to express unto you; the love of God to man in bestowing this
gift: and therefore the Apostle says, the Angels wonder at, and desire to pry
into this mystery, 1. Pet 1. 12. Yea the Prophet says, that the Lord himself
(a wondering at his own love in this gift) shall call Christ's name wonderful,
Esa. 9, 6. The Lord might have forborne to create us; or when we were created,
he could have preserved us from falling: and when we were fallen, he could
without this cost (this gift and price) have redeemed us; but then he should
not sufficiently enough have declared his love to mankind.

The second reason whereby this may appear to be the greatest of all gifts, 2.
is in respect of the benefit we receive by the gift, and the fruits and
consequents of it.

For first, whereas all worldly benefits, yea and many excellent gifts of Gods
spirit also a man may enjoy and perish with them; as Esau, Saul, and Judas did,
this whosoever receives can never perish, Job. 3. 16. whosoever believes in
him, shall not perish but have life everlasting.

2. All other gifts and benefits proceed from this, as from their fountain, or
else they are no blessings, nor can do us any good. Earthly blessings we have
no title to, neither can they do us any good, without we have him also, and
them for him, and his sake, him has he appointed heir of all things, says
the Apostle, Heb. 12. and God has created them to be received with
thanksgiving (says he, 1. Tim. 4. 3) of them which believe and know the truth;
nor spiritual blessings neither, he has blessed us with all spiritual
blessings in heavenly places in Christ, says Paul, Ephesians. 1. 3. in which respect
also the Apostle says, that for all blessings we must give thanks to God the
Father by him, Col. 3. 17. and Heb. 13. 15. By him let us offer the sacrifice
of praise to God continually.

3. If we have this gift, we may be sure, never to want any other blessing that
shall be good for us, how shall he not with him also, says the Apostle, Romans
8. 32, freely give us all things? and so says our Savior also, Mat. 6. 33.
seek you first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things
shall be added unto you.

The third reason whereby this may appear to be the greatest of all gifts, is
in respect of the freeness of this gift. This gives great price and value to
every gift; the more free it is, the more it is esteemed. Now of all the gifts
that ever God bestowed upon man, this was the freest gift.

First, nothing (neither the good works he foresaw we should do, nor the
faith he foresaw we should have) moved him at the first to find out this way
for our salvation, and to purpose to bestow this gift upon us, but his own
good pleasure only and free grace, He predestined us unto the adoption of
children by Jesus Christ unto himself, says the Apostle, Ephe. 1. 5.
according to the good pleasure of his will.

2. Nothing moved him to give and bestow this gift upon us, but his own good
pleasure and free grace: for what was there in them, upon whom he b^stowed it,
to deserve it by? Consider who they were. He bestowed not his gift only upon
some rare persons for their piety and holiness, as Abraham, Job, Mary (though
if he had, it had been free enough, for there was nothing in them to deserve
it) but upon us all, Romans 8. 32. upon the world, Ioh. 3. 16. and what could
there be in the world to deserve such a gift, (...). Ioh. 5. 19. The whole
world lies in wickedness. It is therefore to be observed, that the Lord (that
the freeness of this gift might be the better acknowledged) sent his Son at
that time, when all things in the Church and Commonwealth, amongst his own
people, were most corrupt and out of order. This greatly amplifies the love of
God in this gift, Romans 5. 8. God commends his love toward us, in that when
we were yet sinners (and enemies also, ver. 10.) Christ died for us.

Thirdly, nothing he requires at our hands for the making of this gift our
own, but only that we should feel the need of it, and receive it at his
hands. He cries, Esa. 55. 1. Hoe, every one that thirsts come, and Ioh. 1.
12. as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God.

The Use of this doctrine is.

First, to teach us not to rest contented, nor to bless our selves, in any
blessing Use. 1
or token of Gods favor we have received, till we be assured, that God has
given us his own Son. This is the only sound cause of joy, Esa. 9. 3. 6.
esteem basely of all other things in comparison of this, as Paul did Phil. 3.
8. no other blessing may give us just cause of joy but this only, Luke. 10.
20. in this rejoice not, etc. but rather rejoice because your names, etc. for
this is the only certain and infallible argument of Gods favor, no outward
thing can assure thee of it. No man knows either love or hatred, by all that
is before them, all things come alike to all, says Solomon. Eccl. 9. 1, 2.
Esau had all outward blessings, in far greater plenty then Jacob had, and yet
(as it is said, Mal. 1. 3. Romans 9. 13.) God hated him. Then only shall we be
truly thankful to God, and love him heartily, when we can be persuaded he
has so loved us, as to redeem us by his Son from hell, when we can say to
him, as David does, Psalm. 86. 12, 13. I will praise thee, Oh Lord my God, with
all mine heart, and I will glorify thy Name for evermore. For great is thy
mercy toward me, and thou have delivered my soul from the lowest hell. 2


2. To confirm us against desperation. Has the Lord so loved the world that
he gave his Son to that end, that whosoever etc. (not excepting, nor
excluding thee, but offering him universally) John 3 16. 2. Yea commanded that
to thee in particular, in the Ministry of the Gospel he should be offered,
Mark 16. 15. Preach the Gospel (says he) to every creature. 3. Yea,
commanded thee in particular, to believe that he belongs to thee, that he dyed
for thee. 1. John 3. 23. This is his commandment that we should believe etc.
4. Requiring nothing at thy hands, to make this gift thine own, but only to
accept and take it at his hands, John 1. 12. 5. So desirous, that thou may
have the benefit of this gift, that he has revealed in his word, that of all
thy sins and rebellions, he takes this for the worst, and accounts it the
most heinous, if thou will not believe, and take this gift of him. The Holy
Ghost shall convince the world, says our Savior himself. John. 16. 9. Of
sin, because they believe not on me, and will thou yet doubt, that he loves
thee not, wilt not thou believe, that he means as he says? and that in this
inestimable love of his, he had respect unto thee, as well as unto any other.

3. To teach us to inquire, how we may know, that this gift belongs 3
to us; the rather, because it is certain, it belongs not to all. John. 17. 9.
I pray not for the world, no, not to all that pretend title to it, and seem
very that it is theirs. Mat. 7. 21. Not every one that says Lord, Lord, shall
enter into the Kingdom of heaven.

Three notes we shall try by, whether we have indeed received this gift.

1. No man ordinarily comes to Christ till the law has schooled him, and
brought him to Christ: Gal. 3. 24. till then we are like the Laodiceans, Revel.
3. 17. we say that we are rich, and increased with goods and have need of
nothing; we know not that we are wretched and miserable, and poor, and
blind, and naked, till then we are so proud that we will never crave, nor
stretch out, or open our hand to receive this gift: First we must be poor in
spirit and mourners for that, before ever we can hunger and thirst, etc. as
appears by our Saviors gradation, Mat. 5. 3. 4. 6.

2. So soon as we have received Christ, we have received also the Spirit of
Adoption. Romans 8. 15. And as so soon as he was in the ship, all was calm
and quiet: Mat 14. 32. so shall we find that upon the receiving of Christ our
hearts will be at peace: Romans 5. 1, Being justified by faith we have peace with
God.

3. So soon as we have received Christ, we have received also the Spirit of
sanctification. 2. Cor. 5. 17. If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.
And howsoever a man may receive all other gifts from God, and never love him;
but even set their mouth against the heavens, as the Prophet speaks, Psalm.
73. 9. Yet, this can none receive, but he shall love the Lord dearly, and
study how to honor, and show himself thankful unto him. See this in David,
Psalm 18. 1. I will love thee O Lord my strength; 2. the Lord is my God, etc.
and Psalm. 116, 1. I love the Lord, because he has heard my voice and my
supplications, and the occasion of those supplications, the hearing whereof
made him so to love the Lord, he expresses, verse 3. The sorrows of death
compassed me, and the pains of hell got hold upon me, I found trouble and
sorrow. He that has truly felt (being schooled and nurtured to it by the
ministry of the Law) his own miserable estate by nature, and has received by
faith this assurance, that Christ has ransomed him from it; (has received
this gift) can not choose but love the Lord dearly for it.

Lecture the fourth, Feb. 21. 1608. JOHN IIII. X.
THe last day, beginning to speak of the cause that our Savior gives, why
this woman did not ask of him the Water of life (which was the third general
part of this text) she knew not that gift of God, nor who it was that said,
etc. I told you, there were 3. points to be observed in these words. 1. That he
calls himself that gift of God. 2. That he says, the cause why she asked
not this Water of life of him, was for that she knew him not. 3. That he says,
if she had known him, she would have asked it of him. The first ^f these three
points we finished the last day, and learned from it, that Christ is the
chief, the greatest gift, the principal token of his love, that ever God gave
unto men. It follows now, that we come to the two last points:

1. That he says, the cause why she asked not, was that she knew him not. 2.
That he says, if she had known him, she would have asked.
In the first we must observe, that our Savior says, the cause why this woman
made no use of him, made no reckoning of that Water of life, which he had to
bestow, was for that she knew him not: and from thence we learn: That
ignorance is a chief cause of all profaneness, and contempt of Gods grace.

This we shall find noted of them that have been notoriously profane; the
reason why they refused to serve God, and asked what profit they should have by
praying to him, is said to be this, that they knew him not, for so they said,
Job 21. 15. Who is the almighty, etc. and Psalm. 10. 4. When David had said, the
wicked is so proud that he seeks not for God, he gives this for the reason,
he thinks always there is no God. Neither is it so only with notorious
Atheists, but with every natural man, even the ciuillest man in the world,
whom you see careless in religion, and a contemner of grace, his ignorance is
the cause of it. The cause why the heathen did not call upon God, Psalm. 79. 6.
is said to be this, that they knew him not, Romans 3. 11. There is none that
understands, there is none that seeks God, Ephesians. 4. 18. What makes all the
Gentiles strangers from the life of God? Having their understanding darkened,
they are strangers from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them.

If men knew, and were persuaded of the comfort that is to be found in
godliness, and the reward thereof, they could not but desire and love it. So
men fear not hell, for that they foresee it not, if they could see that pit
open, if they knew and believed the torments that the damned do endure in it,
they would certainly fear it, and the way that leads to it.

The reason of the Doctrine is evident, even in nature, for the will and
affections Reason.
are moved by the understanding; that sits at the stern in the soul of man. A
man can neither fear, nor love, nor desire, nor hate, nor joy, nor grieve, for
any thing, but according to the apprehension he has of it in his
understanding. That is the reason, why the Scripture imputes all the sins of
Gods people, to the error of the mind, all their sins are called the errors
of the people, Heb. 9. 7. As at the first Satan drew Eve to sin by deceiving
her, 1. Tim. 2. 14. So has he done all her posterity ever since. Sin
deceived me, says the Apostle, Romans 7. 11. Therefore the Lord in his word
makes it the first and greatest work of grace to reform the mind and
understanding: Romans 12. 2. Be ye changed by the renewing of your mind. Col. 3.
10. The new man is renewed in knowledge. And there is great cause why this
should be acknowledged to be so, because the imaginations, and thoughts, and
conceits of the mind, are, as the Apostle calls them, 2. Cor. 10. 4. 5. Those
strong holds, and those high things within us that are exalted against the
knowledge of Christ. Yea, knowledge is the root and fountain of all other
graces, 2. Pet. 1. 2. Grace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of
God, and Verse. 3. His divine power has given us all things that pertain to
life and godliness; through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory
and virtue.

The first use of this doctrine is, to persuade every man of the evil and
danger of ignorance, of the great necessity of seeking the knowledge of Gods
Use 1.
Word. Shall all men think it necessary to take pains for skill and knowledge
how to live here, and shall any be so far given up to a reprobate mind, as to
think there is no danger to live in the ignorance of Gods Word? that there is
no pains nor care to be taken for attaining the knowledge of Gods Word? Yet
(because many are of that mind) I will in few words endeavor to show them the
danger of this ignorance.

1. He that wants the knowledge of Gods Word, can neither have true patience,
nor comfort, nor hope in any affliction, Romans 15. 4. Through patience and
comfort of the Scripture, men come to true hope; Experience teaches this; that
all ignorant men like to Foelix, Act. 24. 25. are apt to tremble, (when once
the conscience is awakened) at the very thought of death and judgment. That
made David say, Psalm. 94. 12. Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord,
and teach him out of thy law. As if he should say, it is a great happiness
for a man that is in affliction to have understanding, and to be instructed by
the Lord in the knowledge of his Word.

2. He that wants the knowledge of Gods Word, is still in the power and
dominion of Satan, as is plain by that speech of Christ unto Paul, Act. 26.
18. I send thee (says he) to turn them from darkness to light, and from the
power of Satan unto God. In which respect also Satan is called, Ephesians. 6. 12. the
Ruler of the darkness of this world, Satan leads such whither he will, 2.
Tim. 2. 25. 26. And (as the Proverb is, the blind swalloweth many a fly) so
certainly such swallow many a great sin, without any scruple or remorse for it.

3. He that wants the knowledge of Gods Word, can never go to heaven; but
must needs perish eternally; God brings all to heaven by knowledge, he will have
all men to be saved (says the Apostle, 1. Tim. 2. 4.) and to come unto the
knowledge of the truth. God has said, none that want knowledge, shall come
there, My people perish for want of knowledge says the Lord, Hos. 4. 6. Yea
God has sworn it, They have not known my ways (says the Lord) Psalm. 95.
10. 11. Unto whom I swear in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.

But because men have many figge-leaues to cover their shame in this point, and
many conceits, whereby they bless themselves, against all that may be said
against them for their ignorance. I will show you how the Holy Ghost in the
Word, drives them by all their shifts, and thrusts them out of their starting
holes.

1. One blesses himself in this; that though he have no Scripture-learning,
yet he is just in all his dealings with men, and leads as honest and
unblameable a life as the best. Yea, but the Scripture says, thou must join
to thy virtue knowledge, or it is nothing worth, 2. Pet. 1. 5.

2. Another in this, that he has more then so; he has not only civil
honesty, to commend him to men; but he uses also to pray, and show devotion
toward God: yea, but the Scripture says, thy prayer can do thee no good,
while thou art void of the desire of knowledge, it is but the sacrifice of
fools, Eccl 5. 1. Pro. 28. 9. He that turns away his ear from hearing the
law, even his prayer shall be abominable.

3. Another in this, that he thanks God he has a good mind, a good meaning,
and intent to please God, as good and as upright an heart toward God, as the
best: but the Scripture says, the man that wants knowledge, cannot have a good
mind nor a good meaning, Pro. 19. 2. Without knowledge the mind is not good.

The Scripture teaches us, that uprightness of heart and knowledge are
inseparable, there can be no uprightness of heart, where there is no
knowledge: their good meanings and intentions will not bring any to heaven. The
true Religion and way to heaven, is called the way of understanding, Pro. 96.

4. Another blesses himself in this, that yet this is his comfort, that
Christ died for sinners, and he trusts to be saved by Christ, though he care
not for the means of knowledge, he says with them, 1. Cor. 1. 12. I am
neither of Paul, nor Apollo, nor Cephas, I depend not on, nor care for any
Ministry, I am of Christ. But the Scripture says, that no man can say that he
is in Christ, till he have knowledge, Ioh. 12. 46. I am come a light into the
world, that whosoever belieueth in me, should not abide in darkness. No man
can be justified by Christ, or obtain any benefit by him that is void of
knowledge, By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many, says the
Lord, Esa. 53. 11.

5. Another ignorant man comfort himself in this, that yet God is
merciful: and he trusts to be saved through Gods mercy. But the Scripture
says, none shall have benefit by Gods mercy, that is void of knowledge, Oh
continue thy loving kindness to them that know thee, says David, Psalm. 36.
10. Esa. 27. 11. It is a people of no understanding, therefore he that made
them will not have mercy on them.

6. Another in this, that he hopes, God will not look, that he should have
this knowledge of the Scripture; for he through his education and age is
unlearned, and simple, and unable to learn. But the Scripture says, He that
is skillful and wise enough in the things of this life, and can understand and
bear away other things (as ballads and foolish songs) and yet is too
weakeheaded to conceive in any measure of the Word of God, shall never be
excused by his simplicity before God; He that is wise to do evil, but to do
good has no knowledge, as the Lord complains, Ier. 4. 22. Yea, how simple
soever thou art, if thou had the fear of God, and an honest heart, thou
might attain to the knowledge of the Word: for in this very point the
Scripture has an excellency above all other learning, Pro. 1. 4. Psalm. 119.
130. It gives understanding to the simple.

If this beso; how miserable is the state of the most of the people in all
Application.
places of the land? Surely such, as if we had the same mind in us that was in
Christ; it would make our bowels to yearne within us as his did, Mat. 9. 36.

For first, they are extremely ignorant, and it may be said of them, as Acts
17. 23. They worship an unknown God, they worship the true God ignorantly.
Examine them, and ask whether they know themselves to be sinners, they will
answer (in general it may be) all men are sinners. But try them in particular,
and you shall find that they know not what sin is, they know not any
commandment which they have broken. Ask them whether they be assured that they
shall be saved; their answer will be no, none can be sure; but they hope well.
Ask them how they hope to be saved, some will answer by their good deeds;
others by Gods mercy. Tell them that God is just, as well as merciful, and
ask them how they hope to have his justice satisfied: their answer will be,
they cannot tell, they are not learned.

Ask them what Christ is? their answer will be, a man I trow; if you ask was
he no more? They will say, yes he was more; ask what more? then they will say
that is too deep a question, they were never asked the like before.

2. Yea they are not only so extremely ignorant, but they desire not knowledge
nor the means thereof, but say unto God in their hearts like those, Job 21.
14. Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. If they be
thus questioned withal (though by their Minister) yet they are all the while,
like the fish out of the water, desirous as may be, to be rid of his company:
yea they love their foolishness and ignorance, they hate and despise, flout,
and scorn all means of knowledge, and such as seek after them, as the Holy
Ghost speaks, Fools despise wisdom and instruction (says Solomon, Pro. 1.
7. and Ver. 22.) How long ye simple ones (says he) will ye love simplicity,
and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge: They
hate knowledge you see, yea they hate it with a perfect hatred; and this is
that, that makes their estate so fearful, Pro. 1. 28. 29. They shall seek me
early, but shall not find me, for that they hated knowledge. This is that that
will cause the Lord to deny them all comfort of his mercy, when they shall most
desire it, because they hated knowledge and the means thereof.

The second use of this doctrine is, for the direction of every one, whom God
has charged with the care of other men's souls; to labor first in this; 2.
to bring them to knowledge, till then, they can have no good affection, no
desire or care of their salvation.

1. The Minister is bound to labor in this, to bring the people to knowledge;
and therefore bound to teach diligently, 2 Timothy 4. 2. and to teach plainly
also. The Levites caused the people to understand the Law (Neh. 8. 7. 8.) they
read in the book, in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused
them to understand the reading. Think it not enough to tickle the ear, or to
move the affections, but lay a good foundation of Doctrine, teach soundly and
substantially, Reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine
(says the Apostle, 2. Tim 4. 2.) Doctrine must be the ground and foundation of
all exhortations and reproves. Yea he must catechize as well as preach, 1.
Cor. 3. 2. He must give milk to the babes, as well as strong meat to grown
men.

2. The Magistrate is bound to see that the people be taught and instructed,
this was Iehoshaphats care, (...). Chron. 17. 7. Yea he is bound also to
compel them to the use of the means of knowledge, Luke 14. 23. Compel them
to come in, says the Lord to his servant, and the Magistrate is Gods servant
as well as the Minister is in this work.

3. The Master of the family is bound to use all means, to bring them that are
under him, to knowledge. Train up a child in the way he should go in (says
the Lord to the parent, Pro. 22. 6. and Deuteronomy. 6. 7.) Thou shall teach my words
diligently to thy children. Parents (we see) are bound themselves to instruct
their children in religion; yea and they must also bring them to the public
means of knowledge, as is plain by the fourth commandment, Exodus 20. 10.

4. Every Christian is bound, to seek by all means, to draw others to
knowledge, Col. 3. 16. Teach one another. Yea he is bound to persuade them also
unto the means of knowledge, saying, as, Esa. 2. 3. Come ye, let us go unto
the mountain of the Lord, and as Philip did to Nathanael, Ioh. 1. 46.
specially his friends and kindred, as Cornelius did, Act. 10. 24.

We all complain of the profaneness of the people, and of their contempt
Application.
of the Word. The Minister complains of the stubbornness, and unthankfulness
of his people; and of their profaneness and contempt of the Word, in his
Ministry. The Magistrate also finds cause often times to complain of the
overmuch pronesse of the people to naughtiness; of the increase of thieues
and murderers. The parents, of their childrens unnaturalness, disobedience,
and riot. The master, of his servants idleness, unfaithfulness, and
stubbornness. All men of the badnesse of the times, and that small fidelity,
and love, and piety, that is to be found among men. But few or none look to
the cause, and fountain of all this, few or none lay any part of this upon
themselves; we may complain in this case, as the Prophet does, Ier. 8. 6. No
man repents him of his own wickedness, and neglect of duty, no man says,
what have I done, have not I been a great cause of all this? The cause of all
this is the want of the knowledge of God, There is no knowledge of God in the
land, and that is the chief causes why by swearing, and lying, and killing,
and stealing, and committing adultery, men break out, and blood touches
blood, as the Prophet complains, Hos. 4. 1. 2. And because there is in men
naturally, neither knowledge, nor desire of it, but a scornful contempt and
hatred of it, every one of us in our places, should have done as much for them,
as the friends of the Palsy-man did, Mar. 2. 3. We should have done what we
could to bring them to the means of knowledge, as they did take great pains
to bring him to Christ (who had otherwise never come to him) Mar. 2. 3. And if
we had done this for them with as good a heart as they did that, for that poor
man, we should have no cause to doubt, but Christ would have had been as ready
to accept and bless our labor in it, as he was theirs, of whom it is said,
Ver. 5. that Christ when he saw their faith, did as much for the poor man as
they desired, and more too; for he not only cured him of his palsy, and
restored life and sense to the members of his body, but pardoned his sin, and
so revived his soul also. And certainly on the other side, if we have not dove
our endeavor to bring them to knowledge, we have made our selves guilty of all
their sins.

The third use of the Doctrine is, to persuade us to a diligent use of all
means, that may bring us to knowledge. I say to the use of all Use 3.
means.

1. Hearing, of which our Savior says, Mar. 4. 24. that proportionable to our
frequency and diligence in it, our growth in knowledge and grace shall be. With
what measure you mete (says he) it shall be measured to you again, And to you
that hear shall more be given. 2. Reading, by the diligent use whereof the
Lord says, Deuteronomy. 17. 19. We shall learn to fear him, and to keep all the
words of his law. 3. Conferring and questioning with others, wherein while the
Disciples that were iournying toward Emaus, did reverently and devoutly
exercise themselves, Christ drew near and joined himself unto them, and
opened the Scriptures unto them, as we read, Luke 24. 15. 32. Yea we are to be
persuaded to the diligent use of these means. If we desire knowledge, and love
it indeed, and be persuaded of the danger of ignorance, we will use these
means with diligence and care, we will hear ordinarily and constantly,
Watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors, as the wisdom
of God speaks, Pro. 8. 34. 2. When we hear we will give diligent attention,
and mark how the Doctrine that is delivered, arises from the text. Whether
the proofs be rightly alleged, and do naturally and soundly confirm that
they are alleged for. How the exhortations and reproves that are given, are
grounded on the Doctrine. Such a hearing is required of them that desire
knowledge, Esa. 55. 2. 3. Hearken diligently unto me, incline your ear, and
come unto me, hear and thy soul shall live.

3. Be careful to remember that thou hear, Hide my commandments with thee,
says Christ, Pro. 2. 1. And we ought to give earnest heed (says the Apostle,
Heb. 2. 1.) to the things which we have heard, least at any time we should let
them slip.

4. Meditate, and call it to mind, after thou have heard, Thou shall meditate
in the book of the Law (says the Lord to Joshua chap. 1. 8.) day and night,
that thou may observe to do according to all that is written therein. q. d.
Thou shall never attain to that knowledge of the Word, as will bring thee to a
conscionable practice of it, unless thou use to meditate of it when thou have
read it or heard it. And it is made a note of the godly man, Psalm. 1. 2. That
his delight is in the Law of the Lord, and he does meditate in it day and
night. q. d. He that delights in it, cannot choose but meditate much in it; and
none but he that does so, can keep himself from walking in the counsel, etc.

5. Pray heartily to God for his blessing upon all the means thou use to
obtain knowledge by. If thou cryest after knowledge (Prou. 2. 3. 5.) and
liftest up thy voice for understanding; then shall thou understand the fear of
the Lord, and find the knowledge of God. Therefore David (though he were much
given to reading and meditation and all other good means of knowledge, yet)
used to cry often to God for this grace, Psalm. 119 26. 27. Teach me thy statutes,
make me to understand the way of thy precepts.

To reprove such, and discover their contempt of knowledge, that use not the
means; or not all the means; or use them not with any care and diligence:
Application.
never take the bible into their hands; at least, read it not constantly;
hear, either not at all, or not ordinarily, or not diligently, cannot endure
to talk of religion. Many of these pretend, that though they follow not, nor
care for Sermons, nor read much, yet they thank God they have knowledge enough
for their salvation. But these men will one day find, that this knowledge they
have thus of themselves; without the ordinary means of instruction, shall do
them no good, Ier. 10. 14. Every man is a beast by his own knowledge, and
saving knowledge can never be attained unto without instruction, Pro. 8. 33.
Hear instruction and be wise, and refuse it not, he only loves knowledge
that loves instruction, Pro. 12. 1.

Lecture the fifth, Feb. 28. 1608.
WE have already heard that in the third part of this Text, (viz. the cause why
this woman of Samaria asked not of Christ the water of life, She knew not that
gift of God, and who it was that said unto her, give me drink,) three points
were to be observed.

First, that Christ calls himself that gift of God.

Secondly, that he says, the cause why she made no use of him, was for that
she knew him not.

Thirdly, that he says, if she had known him, she would have asked of him,
and he would have given her the water of life.

Of these three points, the two first we have already handled. Now it remains
that we come to the third and last.

Whereas therefore our Savior says of this woman that was a Samaritan, and
one of the worst of all the Samaritans) that if she had known that gift of God
if she had known him, she would have made use of him, even this use; she would
have asked of him the water of life. We learn, That whosoever Doct. 6.
knows Christ aright, cannot choose but feel in himself the want of grace,
and earnestly desire it.

This Doctrine, and this speech of Christ, upon which it is grounded, at the
first hearing, may seem strange and incredible; for certain it is, many have
knowledge; that neither have grace, nor any true desire of grace: but are as
ungracious men as live in the world, and that makes the Apostle to speak so
contemptibly of knowledge, We know (says he, 1 Cor. 8. 1.) that we have all
knowledge; knowledge puffs up.

Yea, 2, A man may have the knowledge of the Scriptures, and of those holy
things that are contained in them (which of all knowledges is the most
excellent, I have more understanding (says David, Psalm. 1 19. 99.) then all my
teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.) and yet be void of all grace,
and all desire of grace too, Ioh. 7. 48* 49. The people that knew not the Law,
had more desire of grace then the learned Pharisees.

3. A man may even have the knowledge of Christ, and yet be void of grace;
Satan himself wants not the knowledge of Christ, as appears, Mar. 1. 24. Yea
the most certain and undoubted knowledge, for he believes also, I am. 1. 19.

4. Yea, there is a kind of kingdom, which (of all the corruptions that are in
the nature of man) is the greatest impediment, and bar unto saving grace,
Romans 8. 7. The carnal mind (and wisdom of the flesh) is enmity against God,
for it is not subject, etc. Esa. 47. 10. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge it has
perverted thee. In which respect it is noted as a wonder, Act. 6. 7. That a
great company of the Priests were obedient to the faith.

But this knowledge which I have now spoken of, is not true and sanctified
knowledge; but knowledge falsely so called, as the Apostle speaks, 1. Tim. 6.
20. Wonder not, that that which the Scripture calls knowledge, I deny to be
true knowledge; for so does the Holy Ghost in many places. Our Savior Mat. 11.
25. speaks of some that were wise, and men of understanding (in the Scriptures
he means) and yet the mysteries of Gods Kingdom were hidden from them, and
Paul, 1. Cor. 8. 1. 2. Speaks of some, that have knowledge, and yet know
nothing as they ought to know. And though it be said of all the Jews, Romans 2.
18. That they knew the will of God, and approved the things that were
excellent, in that they were instructed in the law, yet does the Lord often
complain of the Jews, that they had no knowledge. Hos. 4. 1. 6. Romans 10. 2.

But he that knows Christ aright, cannot choose but feel in himself the want
of grace, and earnestly desire it. See the proof of this in the description
our Savior makes of a true Christian, Mat 5. 3. 6. (he is poor in spirit; he
mourns, for that he is meekned and humbled thereby; he hungreth and thirsts
after righteousness) and in the experience of all that have best known Christ
and have been most assured of Gods favor in him. David knew Christ well, and
see what want of grace he felt in himself, and the desire he had of it, As
the Heart brayeth for the rivers of water, so pants my soul after thee O God,
Psalm. 42. 1. Paul knew Christ well, and see the feeling he had of the want of
grace in himself, and desire he had to it. To will is present with me, says
he, Romans 7. 18. q d. I would feign do better I would feign have more grace,
and verse 24. o wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of
this death? q d. how feign would I be delivered from this corruption that
cleaves so unto me. And Phil. 3. 10. he professes his earnest desire was to
know Christ and the power of his resurrection: that is, to know him better and
better every day.

The reason why, men that before felt no want of grace in themselves, when once
they know Christ aright, fe^le the want of nothing so much, hunger and Reason.
thirst after nothing so much as Gods grace, is this; that, 1. their
regeneration (as well as their knowledge) is imperfect, 1. Cor. 13. 9. 1.


2. The true knowledge of God, is like unto the light, yea to a maruallous
light, 1. Pet. 2. 9. and the nature of light is to discover and make all things
manifest, 2.
Ephesians. 5. 13. and consequently they that have most grace and saving knowledge in
them, must needs discern better the want of grace in themselves, then they
that want grace can do.

The use of the Doctrine is, first to kindle in us a desire of saving
knowledge, and an earnest endeavor to obtain it by the use of all the good
means God has appointed.

For first, as a man can have no assurance of his Election, till he feel that
the Lord does effectually call and convert him, and so execute his eternal
decree of electing him within himself: so this is one of the first works of
Gods grace, whereby a man shall perceive that he is actually elected, when God
works knowledge in him, and an endeavor to increase in knowledge, Hos. 6. 2.
After two days he will reuine us, and in the third day he will set us up, and
we shall live in his sight. ver. 3. Then shall we have knowledge, and
endeavor our selves to know the Lord, Have thou no knowledge? no endeavor
after knowledge? surely God has not yet begun to revive thee, but thou
remainest dead in thy sins, Psalm. 67. 1. 2. When God once begins to be
merciful unto us, and to cause his face to shine upon us, then shall his ways
and saving health be made known unto us.

2 Knowledge is the foundation of all other graces, if our faith, zeal, love,
etc. be grounded upon knowledge, they will last and abide, as the house built
upon the rock; but if we have never so good and holy affections, they will be
of no continuance, unless they be grounded upon knowledge, yea proportionable
to the measure of saving knowledge, is the durablenesse and comfort of all
other graces, 2. Pet. 1. 2. Grace and peace be multiplied to you, by the
knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ our Lord, and ver. 3. According, as his
divine power has given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness,
through the knowledge of him that has called us unto glory and virtue. That
is the reason of this fervent prayer Paul makes, Col. 2. 2. That their hearts
might be comforted, and they knit together in love, and in all riches of the
full assurance of understanding, to know the mystery of God the Father, and of
Christ. So that if thou endeavor not to increase in knowledge, all thy good
affections will vanish as the morning deaw, when they should stand t^ee in most
stead.

3. Knowledge brings with it all other saving graces; so that he that has
true and sanctified knowledge, shall be sure to want no grace that is needful
for his salvation, John 17. 3. This is life eternal to know thee.

In which respect, you shall see, how singular a blessing and token of Gods
favor, David esteemed the knowledge of the word to be, by his so frequent and
fervent prayers he makes to God for it, Psalm. 25. 4. 5. 8. 9. 12. 14. and in
sundry other places of the Psalms.

What shall we say to them then that care not for knowledge, use no means
Application.
to obtain it, read not, hear not, or if they do, do it not ordinarily, or
i^ ^hey do that, do it not with any care to profit in knowledge by that they
hear or read; surely they are far from salvation, as David pronounces, Psalm.
119. 155. and how well soever they think of themselves, the Holy Ghost
pronounces them to be profane Atheists and contemners of God. They that do
thus profess in their lives that they desire not the knowledge of his ways,
they have said in their hearts, unto God: Depart from us, who is the Almighty,
that we should serve him. Job. 21. 14. 15.

2. Use, is for them that persuade themselves they have knowledge; that 2
seeing we have heard, there is a knowledge that is common to many a reprobate,
and will do a man no good, but much hurt; and there is a knowledge, that is
proper to the elect, and a certain sign of Gods favor and unchangeable love:
that therefore we rest not in this, that we have knowledge, but seek for
saving and sanctified knowledge, and examine our selves well whether we have
yet attained to this knowledge that accompanies salvation, yea or no. I will
therefore give you, out of Gods word, certain notes whereby you may discern
it, and they may be referred to three heads, for saving knowledge, the
knowledge of the elect, may be discerned from the knowledge, that may be in the
reprobate. 1. By the efficient causes. 2. By the effects. 3. By the properties
of it.

The efficient causes of it are four. 1. The Spirit of God is the only worker
of it, no wit, nor means, nor study can work it, but the Spirit of God is
the only worker of it: John 6. 45. it is written, they shall be taught of God.
And in that respect no man is capable of it, but he that has the Spirit of
God. Psalm. ^5. 4. The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he
will show them his Covenant. 2. It is not attained, but by the hearing of the
word ordinarily. By reading, and other means, I deny not, but a man may
attain to a great measure of knowledge, but the least measure of saving
knowledge, of that knowledge that may yield him sound comfort, no man can
(ordinarily) attain to, but by hearing: 1. Cor. 1. 21. It has pleased God, by
the foolishness of preaching, to save men. The glory of the Lord his power,
and justice, sufficient to make us to fear him seruilely may be seen
elsewhere, but the beauty of the Lord, which may make him amiable to us (the
comfortable knowledge of God) is to be seen no where, but in the Temple, and
in this ordinance of his, the ministry of his word. Psalm 27. 4. 3. It is
gotten by earnest prayer; the man that never prays, may attain to knowledge,
but (say he have the best means, the best ministry) he shall never attain to
the least measure of sanctified knowledge, if he use not to pray heartily for
Gods blessing upon the means. Prou. 2. 3. 5. If thou cryest after knowledge,
then shall thou understand, etc. that made David to cry to God so earnestly for
this, Psalm. 119. 18. 4. It is confirmed by experience, Psalm 119. 140. thy Word
is proved most pure, and thy servant loves it, Romans 12. 2. Be ye changed by
the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what that good and acceptable and
perfect will of God is. This is that knowledge Job got by his afflictions, Job
42. 5. Now mine eyes sees thee, says he. This is that spoken of, Ier. 32. 8.
Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord, he knew before, but experience
now added to the certainty of his knowledge.

The effects whereby saving knowledge is to be discerned from the other, are
three.

1. It puffs not up a man as other knowledge does, 1. Cor. 8. 2. but makes
him to have a lowly conceit of himself; because he discerns much more
ignorance then knowledge in himself. The cause why the Laodiceans were so well
conceited of themselves, was, for that their eyes were not opened, Apoc. 3. 17,
18. Experience shows this to be true in the best of Gods servants, and such
as have most profited by the word, they are humble minded, and ever complaining
of their own ignorance, surely I am more brutish then any man, says Agur,
Pro. 30. 2. 3. and have not the understanding of a man, I have neither learned
wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.

2. It rests not in the brain, but works upon the heart and affections,
Esa. 51. 7. Ye people that know righteousness, in whose heart is my law. This
light is not like that of the Moon, but of the Sun, that not only gives
light, but warmeth and quickneth every thing. Paul prays their love might
abound in all knowledge, and in all feeling or judgment, Phil. 1. 9. No man
truly knows God with a sanctified knowledge, but he loves him also, and thus
are these two graces coupled together, Psalm. 91. 14. Because he has set his
love upon me. thereforewill I deliver him. I will set him on high, because he
has known my name No man truly knows God with a sanctified knowledge, but
he also puts his trust in him, Psalm. 9 10. They that know thy name, will put
their trust in thee.

3. It works reformation of heart and life, Job 28. 28. To depart from evil
is understanding, 1. Ioh. 2. 3. Hereby we are sure that we know him, if we
keep his commandments, and verse 4. He that says, I know him and keeps not
his commandments, is a liar: and verse 11. He that hates his brother is in
darkness, and walks in darkness, and knows not whither he goes, because
that darkness has blinded his eyes. Therefore it is said of the sons of
Eli, 1. Sam 2. 12. That they knew not God.

4. It makes men strong to resist and stand against temptations, Prou. 24. 5. A
wise man is strong, yea a man of knowledge increases his strength.

The properties of saving and sanctified knowledge are two.

1. It is clear and certain, not confused and doubtful, 1. Cor. 2. 15. He
that is 3.
spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is judged of no man: he is so
certain, that no contrary judgment or censure of any man, can make him to
alter his judgment. So 1. Ioh. 2. 27. Ye need not that any man teach you, but
as the same anointing teaches you of all things.

2. There is no satiety in it, but the more a man has of it, the more he does
desire it. As a newborn babe (says the Apostle, 1. Pet. 2. 3) he desires
the sincere milk of the word that he may grow thereby. A wise man (says
Solomon Pro. 1. 5.) will hear and will increase learning, Apollo Acts. 18. 24.
26. though he were already mighty in the scriptures, and able to teach
diligently the things of the Lord, yet was glad to have the way of the Lord
taught and expounded unto him more perfectly by Aquila and Priscilla. And how
earnest is David himself (a man endued with more then an ordinary measure of
knowledge, as appears by that which he says of himself, Psalm. 119. 69, 100.)
yet how earnest, I say, is he often with (God) that he would give him more
knowledge, Psalm 119. 18. 26. 27. Every thing by nature does desire to increase
in that good, wherewith it is already endued; yea the more it has of it, the
more it does desire, because it feels so much the more the sweetness of it; as
so we see, that none are so desirous of riches as the richest, of knowledge as
the best learned. And so is it in saving and sanctified knowledge also, he that
has it indeed, cannot choose but desire to increase it.

THE SIXTH LECTVRE, ON MARCH VII. MDCVIII.
IOH. IIII. XI, XII. The woman says unto him, Sir, thou have nothing to draw
with, and the Well is deep; from whence then have thou that living water?

Art thou greater then our father Jacob, which gave us the Well, and drank
thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?


WE have heard in the former Verse, how our Savior did take occasion upon this
Woman's refusal to give him a little water to drink; both to make himself
known unto her, and to speak, and make offer unto her of a better water, that
he had to bestow upon her. In these words is set down a reply that the woman
makes unto this speech of his: for, she not understanding his meaning, but
thinking that he had spoken of material water, reasons against him after
this manner. The water thou speak of, is either the water of this Well, or
some other better then this: but I cannot see, how thou should give me any
of the water of this Well, because thou have nothing to draw with, and the Well
is deep. And as for any other water that is better then this; I cannot see how
thou should come by it; for Jacob our father gave us this Well, and this was
the best water he could give: for it was the same that himself, and his
children, and his cattle did drink of; and howsoever thou speak of thy
self, as if thou were some rare and excellent man, yet is it possible that
thou should be greater then Jacob?

So that there are two parts of this Text, as there be two reasons why she
could not understand nor believe that which Christ spoke.

1. The reason why she could not perceive and believe that he could give her of
the water of that Well; he had no means, Verse 11. Thou have nothing to draw
with, etc.

2. The reason why she could not perceive or believe, that he could give her
any better water then that, she thought he could not be greater then Jacob,
Verse. 12. Art thou greater then our father Jacob?

Now, before we come to these parts, this is generally to be observed out of
her whole answer, that though she had now begun to feel such a divine power,
as had wrought some change in her mind and affections, yet she cannot
understand Christ, but refuses and reasons against this gracious offer that
he had made unto her. That Gods grace began to have some work in her, it may
appear in that she being a Samaritan, and so wicked a woman also. 1. Does not
answer him scornefully and tauntingly, after this manner; if thou have such
water to bestow, why ask thou water of me to drink? 2. She does not utterly
reject his speech of the water of life that he had to bestow, as ridiculous and
incredible, but doubts of it only, and cannot see how it should be. 3. She
calls him Sir, which is a title of reverence, as we shall see, 1. Pet. 3. 6.
in Sarahs speaking unto Abraham. And yet for all this, that God had begun some
work of grace in her, see the maruailous blindness and perverseness of nature
that appeared in her: for first, though she might well perceive by many
reasons, that he could not mean material water; for 1. She had no need of
that. 2. She saw he had no means to give her that. 3. She heard him speak of
himself, as of some rare and extraordinary person; yet she understands him of
material water. Secondly, she reasons and struggleth against that offer that
he makes unto her, and that work that Gods grace had begun in her.

Whence we learn: That no man by nature can do any thing to further Doct. 1.
or help forward his own conversion, but he does all that he can to hinder
and withstand it. The truth of this doctrine we shall discern in three points,
all which we have an example and experiment of in this poor woman.

1. The natural man has in him no desire of grace, nor the means of grace,
never thinks of it, till God by his word make offer of it unto him. Though he
be in extreme misery, he perceives it not, nor once thinks of any way to come
out of it, but is well persuaded of his own estate. See the experiment of this
in this poor woman: though she were a most filthy and loathsome wretch in Gods
sight, not only by nature, but by that lewd life she had led; and God in his
gracious providence had now sent Christ unto her, that had the water of life to
bestow upon her; and (by the absence of the Disciples) had given her such an
opportunity to have opened her mind unto him, yet she makes no use of him,
never asks of him the water of life.

And this is the state of every man by nature. There is none that seeks God,
Romans 3. 11. I have been found of them that sought me not, and I said, behold
me, behold, etc. Esa. 65. 1. Though the means of grace be never so near him,
though he have never so good opportunity given him of God, to make use of the
means of grace, yet can he not do it, A price is put into his hand to get
wisdom, and he has no heart to it, as Solomon says, Pro. 17 16. Nay, he
feels no need of grace, nor of the means of grace, for he is well persuaded
of his own estate, Reu. 3. 17. he says, He is rich, and increased in riches,
and has need of nothing: see this in Paul before his conversion, I was alive
without the law, says he, Romans 7. 9. Though he neither have knowledge, nor
will take pains for any, yet is he persuaded that he has knowledge enough,
Pro. 26. 16. The Sluggard is wiser in his own conceit, then seven men that can
render a reason.

2. When God by his Word does make offer of his grace unto him, the natural
man cannot perceive it. Our Savior began to make himself known unto this
woman, and makes offer to her of the water of life, but she understands him
not. And this is the state of every man by nature, 1. Cor. 2. 14. He cannot
know them, because they are spiritually discerned. Even they that have
otherwise the best capacities, are strangely sottish and blockish in conceiving
the things belonging unto Gods kingdom, Ioh. 1. 5. The light shined in the
darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. Christ speaks of the eating
of his flesh, and drinking of his blood; his hearers understood him (as Papists
now do) of eating him corporally, Ioh. 6. 53, 60. yea, see an evident proof of
this, in such as the Lord had begun grace in. See it in Nicodemus, a master and
teacher of Israel, when Christ spoke to him of the necessity of regeneration,
he thought he had meant that a man must enter the second time into his mothers
womb, and be borne. And when our Savior had explaned himself, that he spoke
not of a corporal regeneration, but of a spiritual, he judged his Doctrine to
be most absurd and incredible, How can these things be, said he, Ioh. 3. 4. 9.
See it in the Elect Disciples; when Christ had bidden them Beware of the leaven
of the Pharisees and Sadduces, they understood him of material leaven, Mat.
16. 7. Though Christ had often and plainly taught them the Doctrine of the
Resurrection, Mat. 16. 21. and 17. 23. and 20. 19. And they were a great while
the ordinary hearers of so excellent a Teacher, and had also the benefit of
private conference with him, yet see how far they were from understanding it,
John ^0. 9. And if they were so blockish, whose eyes the Lord had begun to
open, and in whom his grace had already begun to work, how great must the
blindness and sottishness of the mere natural man needs be? So that the
calling of every one of Gods Elect may be fitly resembled by the Lords calling
of young Samuel. Three times the Lord called him, and he perceived it not, but
thought it had been only Elies voice, 1. Samuel 3. 10. Thus did Samuel (says
the Text) before he knew the Lord, and before the Word of the Lord was
revealed unto him. And so may it be said of the best of us; many a time we
heard the Lord speaking unto us in his Word, and perceived nothing.

3. When God by his Word and Spirit begins to enlighten the natural man, and
not only makes offer of his grace unto him, but makes him in some measure able
to perceive it; he is so far from embracing it, that he does oppose and
contradict it by all means.

See how witty this woman is in rejecting the grace that Christ offered unto
her, see how she reasons and struggleth against that light that began to
shine in her heart. So is it with every natural man, when God begins to call
him; Oh how he draws back, what delays he uses, how unwilling he is to go!
This is fitly resembled in the many excuses those made, whom the King bade to
the marriage feast, Luke 14. 18. 20. And in the Lords calling of Lot out of
Sodom, Genesis 19. 15. The Angels hastened Lot, and Verse 16. Yet he prolonged the
time, and they caught him and his wife, and daughters by the hands (the Lord
being merciful unto him) and brought him sorth of the City, and Verse 17.
Again, they hasted him, escape for thy life, look not behind thee, neither
tarry in all the plain. Yet again, he draws back, and the Angel was feign
to call upon him again, Verse 18. 22. This corruption shows it self even in
Gods children, Cant. 5. 3. I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on? I
have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?

2. Yea, he is not only thus slack and backward, but he refuses and
gaine-sayeth the Lord, Romans 10. 21. All the day long have I stretched out mine
hand unto a disobedient and gaine-saying people. This appears four ways.

1. Though he see the truth he will not yield unto it, Psalm. 58. 4. 5. They are
like the dease adder that stops her ear, which will not hear the voice of
charmers, charming never so wisely. He will wrangle and reason against it.

2. Yea, the better wit a man has, the stronger reasonings and oppositions
shall he find in himself against the truth, The wisdom of the flesh is enmity
against God, says the Apostle, Romans 8. 7. and the imaginations of the mind are
those strong holds and high things that are exalted against the knowledge of
Christ, as the Apostle calls them, 2. Cor. 10. 4, 5.

3. He scorneth and hates the truth, it is foolishnes unto him, 1. Cor. 2. 14.
How long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity, and the scorners delight in
scorning, and fools hate knowledge, Pro. 1. 22. He is well enough if these
Preachers would let him alone, if this foolishness of preaching did not so
much trouble him; but this religion, this preciseness, he is ever speaking
against, and exercising his wit when he is on his ale-bench in flouting and
scorning of it; and esteems him his chief enemy that would bring him to
grace, as Ahab did of Eliah, 1. King. 21. 20.

4. Yea, the more God calls upon him, and seeks to bring him to grace, the
worse he will be, Genesis 19. 9. When Lot admonished the Sodomites, though in a
most mild manner, they tell him plainly, they would be the worse for his
counsel. And this is the nature of every man, Romans 7. 8. Sin took occasion
by the commandment, and wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. The better
the means of grace are, and the more clearly Gods truth is taught, the more
lewd and malicious will the natural man show himself.

The reasons of this Doctrine are three, according to these three degrees of
that corruption which is in the natural man. Reason.


1. The reason why he has no desire of grace, is this, the natural man is 1.
dead in trespasses and sins, Ephesians. 2. 1. and therefore our conversion is
called not the restoring of a sick man, nor the healing of a lame man, but the
raising of a dead man, Reu. 20. 6. And how can a dead man desire life, or use
any means to attain it?

2. The reason why he is so blind and blockish in heavenly things, is 2.
this; Adam (not contenting himself with that excellent knowledge and wisdom
which he had by his creation, aspired to be equal with God in knowledge, Genesis
3. 6. And so (through Gods most righteous judgment) lost that knowledge he
had, and brought this sottishness upon himself, and all his posterity.

3. The reason why, when he sees the truth, he does so peruersely resist,
gainsay, and hate it, is, partly the corruption of his own nature; but
chiefly because he is under the power of Satan. He gouernes and rules, and
works in him, Acts 26. 18. Ephesians. 2. 2. 2. Tim. (...). 26. And we know they
in whom Satan reigns, cannot abide Christ nor his Word, but must needs be
disquieted with it, as we see in the example of the Daemoniack, Luke 4. 34.

This Doctrine serves to reprove and convince the religion of the Papists of
gross error in three points. Use.


1. They say, the natural man is able to prepare himself to receive grace:
whereas the Scripture says, 2. Cor. 3. 5. We are not sufficient of our selves
to think any thing as of our selves.

2. That he is able by his free will to accept of grace, when it is offered,
yea to desire it, like the man that lay in the way to Jericho half dead, Luke
10. 3. Whereas the Scripture says, we are not half, but quite dead by nature
in trespasses and sins, Ephesians. 2. 1. and Phil. 2. 13. It is God that works in
you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.

3. That the natural man is able to do some good works, whereas Christ says,
Ioh. 15. 5. Without me ye can do nothing.

And if there were nothing else to assure us; that it is a false and
antichristian religion, this might suffice to do it, for antichrist is called
(...); one that opposes himself to God and his truth, 2. These 2. 4. And even
in this Doctrine he contradicts, 1. The plain and express words of the
Scripture. 2. The whole scope and drift of the Scripture; which is, to debase
the pride of man, and to advance the glory of Gods free grace, God will have no
flesh to glory in his presence, he will have him that glories to glory in the
Lord alone, as the Apostle speaks, 1. Cor. 1. 29. 31. By the law (or
doctrine) of faith (not of works) all boasting is excluded, (says he) Romans 3.
27. And again, Ephesians. 2. 8. 9. By grace are ye saved (says he) through says,
and not of your selves, it is the gift of God. Not of works (whatsoever, done
either before faith received or after) least any man should boast.

2. To teach us what to think of, and how to be affected toward other men
that embrace not the truth.

1. Marvel not, that there be so many that care not for the Gospel, but do so
peeuishly and maliciously reject it. Marvel not, that thou hear of so many
that dote upon that gross and absurd religion of the Papists. Be not offended,
that there be among them very learned men, great disputers, that bring many
arguments against the truth.

You that have to deal with families and flocks, wonder not at that
blockishnesse, and want of capacity, memory, and care, that you find in them.

Wonder rather that there be so many that do love and embrace the truth indeed.
Certainly, they have more cause to wonder at us, then we at them, (as the
Apostle says they do, They think it strange (says he, 1. Pet. 4. 4.) that
you run not with them to the same excess of riot) for they do but their kind,
whereas it is contrary to nature, that any of us should desire, or love, or
obey the Gospel, which is an incredible and a great mystery, 1. Tim. 3. 16.
Yea, the conversion of a sinner is the greatest miracle that ever God wrought.
This changing of our nature is as great a miracle as the changing of the nature
of the Wolf and Leopard, so as to make them lie with the lamb and kid, Esa.
11. 6. Or the making of a Camel to go through the eye of a needle, as our
Savior speaks, Luke 18. 25. For a man to live in the world, and to be kept
unspotted of the world, is as great a miracle, as that the three noble Jews
should be in the fiery furnace, and not be consumed by it, Dan. 3. 27.

2. Oh pity them and pray for them, be not uncharitably affected toward them,
but do what thou can to help them. Remember the compassion and help that
God commands thee to yield to the very beast of thy brother, that is in
misery, and needs thy help, Exodus 23. 5. Yea do it with meekness and
gentleness, as the Apostle charge thee, 2. Tim. 2. 25. 26. and Titus 3. 2.
3. And seeing thou hear, that they are even by nature so unable and so
unwilling also, to receive any good this way, therefore do thou for them, as
the friends of him that had the palsy did, Mar. 2. 3. 4. Seeing of themselves
they cannot come to Christ, nor to the means of grace; use then that credit
thou have with them, to draw them to it.

The third Use is for our selves. 1. Be persuaded of the necessity of the
ministry of the Word, which is the means whereby God has ordained to 3.
show his power in the conversion of man, Romans 1. 16. Yea of a constant and
ordinary Ministry; of a plain Ministry; forasmuch as there remains in the
best of us so much blindness and perverseness of nature.

2. Comfort thy self even in thy desires to the Word, and means of grace, and
in thy weak obedience, if it be sincere, and praise God for it; for thou have
not this by nature, but by grace; thou have attained to that, that very few in
the world (nay in the true Church) have attained unto.

Lecture the seventh, March 14. 1608. JOHN IIII. XI. XII.
IT follows now; that we consider of those reasons that she brings as they
Doct. 2.
lie in order. And first in this, that she cannot believe that which Christ
said, because she saw no means he had to perform that which she spoke of. We
learn, That there is this infidelity and corruption in the nature of man, as
not to give any further credit to any thing the Lord has said, then he can see
likely means how it may be performed.

1. While God gives him means, he will seem full of faith.

2. While he may have the means, he is so full of faith, that he will make no
reckoning of the means, but rely wholly upon God, as Satan would have had
Christ to do, Mat. 4. 6.

3. But when he can see no means, or no likely means, then let God say what
he will, and protest, and swear too, yet he cannot believe him. We shall find
this true, both in the promises that concern this life; and in the promises
that concern a better life also. For the first, see the experience of this
corruption, not in those only that we call Infidels, but in Gods own people,
even in the whole people of Israel (whom the Lord calls his son and his first
borne, Exo. 4. 22.) Though they had had so many and so wonderful
demonstrations of Gods truth and power; yet still when they saw no means of
help, they could never believe Gods promises. Insomuch as the Lord complains
of them, Number. 14. 11. How long will this people provoke me, how long will it
be, yer they believe me, for all the signs which I have showed amongst them?
So Psalm. 78. 40. How often did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him
in the desert? and ver. 41. Yea they returned and tempted God, and limited the
holy One of Israel. Yea Moses and Aaron (the chief Guides and Captains of
them) though they went not so far in infidelity and rebellion, as the
multitude, yet did they also bewray this corruption. See this in Moses alone,
The people among whom I am (says he, Number. 11. 21. 22.) are six hundred
thousand footmen, and thou have said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat
a whole month. Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them to suffice
them? Or shall all the fish of the sea, be gathered together for them to
suffice them? See it also in Moses and Aaron both. The Lord told them, he would
give water to suffice all that people, and their cattle also out of a rock;
this they could not believe, for (though they seemed to believe, in yielding so
presently to the Lords commandment herein, yet) the Lord himself charge
them that they did not believe, Number. 20. 12. Another example we have for this
in Sarah; for, she hearing the promise God had made to her husband concerning a
son, God would give to him by her, she laughed at it, Genesis 18. 12. which was
as if she should have said, That is a jest indeed.

2. The like we shall see in the promises that concern a better life. The
chief cause why men have rejected them, has been this; because the means God
has promised to work them by, are most unlikely. That by Christ's death we
should come to life; by his extreme shame and dishonor we should come to
glory; that by the wars and combats with Satan, and the wrath of God which
he endured, we should be brought to peace and quietness everlasting; that by his
stripes and wounds we should be healed, as the Prophet speaks, Esa. 53. 5.
This seems utterly incredible and impossible to the natural man: In which
respect the Apostle says, 1. Cor. 1. 23. That the preaching of Christ
crucified, was to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishnes.
That the preaching of the Gospel without all show of humane learning, (which
so few esteemed of that were of any estimation for wisdom and authority in the
world) the foolishnes of preaching, should be the only and ordinary means to
bring men to grace; that would not down with them; that could they never be
persuaded of, as the Apostle shows us, 1. Cor. 1. 18. 23. That such kind of
Preachers (especially) that want years, or such other means of learning,
should do any great good, that they cannot believe; See this in Christ's
countrymen, Mat. 13. 55. 57. They were offended at him, and could not honor
him as they ought, because they knew the meannesse of his parentage and
education.

This doctrine serves; first, generally to exhort every one of us to take
notice Use 1.
of this vile corruption in our selves, and to strive against it, Take heed
brethren (says the Apostle, Heb. 3. 12.) least there be in any of you an evil
heart of unbelief. Consider with thy self, 1. Thou can have no comfort in
God, unless thou have faith, Heb. 11. 6. Without faith it is impossible to
please him.

2. Though it may seem an easy thing to believe while thou art in peace, and
in abundance of all good means of comfort (as Papists say, this is too easy a
way to be the right way to heaven) thou will find it hard in the time of
extremity, when that evil day shall come, which the Apostle speaks of, Ephesians. 6.
13. Of all things that God has commanded us, this most needs the mighty hand
of God, and the exceeding greatness of his power, to make us able to perform
it, and so speaks the Apostle of it, Ephesians. 1. 19.

3. Thou have no true faith, unless thou can believe whatsoever God has
said; or if thou do distrust the Lord when the means do fail. Be not
therefore too well persuaded of the strength of thy faith, but pray, and use
all other means to get it increased in thee, and to have the infidelity of thy
heart subdued more and more.

The remedy and means for the subduing of it, is the consideration of these
three points. Remedies against our distrust in God, when means are wanting.


1. That which the Scripture has revealed touching the omnipotency of God,
Genesis 18. 14. Shall any thing be hard to the Lord, ler. 32. 27. I am the Lord
God of all flesh, is there any thing too hard for me? The Lord can do more then
he will do; he can of stones raise up children unto Abraham, Mat. 3. 9. Christ
could by prayer have obtained of his Father more then twelve legions of Angels,
to rescue him from his enemies, Mat. 26. 53. God could have kept Christ from
drinking the cup of his wrath for us, Mar. 14. 36. Yet may no man build on Gods
power, nor can have true comfort in it; or say, God can do this or that if it
please him, unless he have his revealed will to build upon, as well as his
omnipotency. The Papists in their doctrine of the real presence, and many
carnal Protestants, in their contempt of the ordinary means, are grossly
mistaken in this point. Therefore, the faithful professing the comfort they
took in the faith of Gods power, use to join his power, and his truth or
faithfulness together, as Psalm. 89. 8. O Lord God of hosts, who is a strong
God like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee? And where we have
his word and promise for any thing, we may build upon it, and be fully assured,
that he will perform it, be it never so unlike, because he is able to do it.
Thus is the strong faith of Abraham commended by the Apostle, Romans 4. 21. He
was fully persuaded that what God had promised, he was able also to perform.
And thus does David magnify and set forth the omnipotency of God. Psalm. 115.
3. Our God is in the heavens, he has done whatsoever he pleased. See this
proved by sundry plain experiments; for of this truth, we may say as Psalm.
119. 140. Thy word is proved most pure; (by good experience) therefore thy
servant loves it. And these experiments are to be observed in three points.

1. He has done mighty things by very weak means. By three hundred he
overthrew the huge host of the Midianites and Amalakites, who were like
Grasshoppers in multitude, and their Camels without number, Judge 6. 7. 12.

2. He has done mighty things without any natural and ordinary means, he
overthrew the mighty walls of Jericho, and delivered the City into his peoples
hands, only by the blowing of trumpets of Rams horns, and the shouting of the
people, Josh. 6. 20. which made Asa cry to him, 2. Chro. 14. 11. It is nothing
for thee to help with many or with no power.

3. He has done mighty things, when all means have seemed as it were to be
armed against him; and quite contrary to the nature of ordinary means, that he
might show himself to be indeed the Lord of Hosts, as in the case of Isreal's
passing through the Red Sea, Exo. 14. 21. 22. And in the preservation both of
the three noble Jews in the fiery furnace, Dan. 3. 27. and of Daniel in the
Lions den, Dan. 6. 22.

2. To consider how highly God is provoked with this sin, Psalm. 78. 21. 22.
22. 40. 41. They provoked and grieved him; how? by tempting and limiting 2.
him: when Elisha had said, To morrow a measure of fine flower should be sold
for a shekell, because the Prince did but say, Though the Lord would make
windows in heaven, could this thing come to pass? The Prophet in Gods name
threatened, he should see it, (for increase of his misery) but not taste of it,
and so it came to pass, for he died a strange and base death, 2. King. 7. 19.
20. When Zachary (a man just before God, and one, of whose tongue God might
have had more use then of many others) did but make a doubt, upon this ground
he was smitten dumb for forty weeks, Luke 1. 20. Moses and Aaron for doubting
(upon this ground also) of Gods promise, see how severely they were punished
for it, Number. 20. 12.

3. The consideration of the nature of this sin; for, as faith is the root of
all other good things in us: It is that that purifieth the heart, Act. 15. 9.
It is 3.
that that sets love and every grace on work, faith works by love, says
the Apostle, Gal. 5. 6. It is that whereby in our whole conversation we are
enabled to live a holy life, The just shall live by his faith, says the
Prophet, Hab. 2. 4. And there is nothing wherein we so much give glory to God
as by our faith, Romans 4. 20. Number. 20. 12. So on the other side, nothing so much
corrupts the heart of man, as infidelity does, no sin that we can commit,
does the Lord so great dishonor, as when we do thus limit him, and cannot
trust him further then we see him, Ioh. 5. 10. He that belieueth not, has made
him a liar. And what greater disgrace can you put upon any man, then to give
him the lie? Infidelity as it was the first sin whereby Satan deceived and
poisoned mankind (he called Gods truth in question, and sought to bring them
into a doubt of it, Genesis 3. 4.) so is it the root of all other our sins,
whereby we depart from God, Heb. 3. 12. Therefore does our Savior mention it
as the only sin that the Holy Ghost shall convince the world of, Ioh. 29. 6.
and the Apostle as the only thing that depriues us from entering into Gods
rest, Heb. 4. 1.

The second Use is more particular, for our direction and comfort in three
cases. 2.


1. To confirm us against the contempt and base estimation of the means of
grace, It cannot be denied, but if they be judged of by carnal reason, they
will appear to be exceeding weak, and unlikely to effect any such matter. How
can the applying of a little water in Baptism, help to wash the soul from
all sin? or the eating of a little bread, and drinking of a little wine in
the Lords Supper, help the soul, to feed on the body and blood of Christ?
What is there in preaching, (specially this plain kind of preaching, where
little or no learning is showed, specially in the preaching of such and such as
the world knows (by reason of their years and education) have had no means,
or very slender means to bring them to learning) that preaching I say, and
such preaching, and the preaching of such men, should be said to be the only
means of salvation. Now if this conceit do at any time trouble thee,
strengthen thy self against it by considering; First, has God appointed these
means, and promised to effect these things by them: (as it is plain he has,
1. Cor. 1. 21.) then look not to the weakness of the means, but to the power
of him that has ordained them: he is able by weak means to work mighty
things, The foolishness of God (says the Apostle, 1. Cor. 1. 25.) is wiser
then men; and the weakness of God is stronger then men. My strength is made
(that is, declared to be) perfect in weakness, says the Lord, 2. Cor. 12. 9.
Use these means in faith and obedience to Gods Ordinance (not looking too much
to the means) and thou shall find Gods mighty power in these weak means, The
weapons of our warfare are mighty through God, says the Apostle, 2. Cor. 10.
4. If thou can believe in this power of God, and rely in thy hearing (not
upon the excellency of the means) but upon the power of God, that is able to
do whatsoever he has ordained and decreed to do even by the weakest means,
thou shall find this weak ordinance of God, powerful and effectual to thine
own salvation, remember that the Apostle says, Romans 1. 16. It is the power of
God unto salvation. And 1. Cor. 2. 4. That though his preaching was not with
the enticing words of man's wisdom (which he did purposely avoid) yet it had in
it the demonstration of the spirit and of power.

2. To comfort us in all extremities and distresses. When thou shall be at thy
wits end, and can see no means of escape and deliverance, upon this doctrine
thou may stay thy heart and find comfort, Prou. 18. 10. The name of the Lord
is a strong tower, the righteous runs to it, and is exalted. See an example
of this in David when he was in great distress, and in danger to be stoned by
his own soldiers, yet He encouraged himself in the Lord his God, 1. Sam. 30.
6. And Psalm. 61. 2. When my heart is oppressed (says he) bring me unto the
rock that is higher then I. And I will tell you how you must do to find
comfort in the knowledge of Gods power in such a case. 1. Consider and meditate
of these promises of God, Heb. 13. 5. 6. He has said, I will not fail thee,
nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my help, I will not
fear what man can do unto me, Psalm. 91. 4. He will cover thee under his wings,
and thou shall be sure under his feathers, his truth shall be thy shield and
buckler, Psalm. 84. 11. No good thing will be withold from them that walk
uprightly, and Romans 8. 28. We know that all things work together for good to
them that love God. 2. Labor to know thou art one to whom these promises are
made; that thou art a belieuer, and one that fears God. For to them that are
wicked, I can promise no protection nor deliverance from any danger; but to
them I say, that they have cause to fear danger at home and abroad, by night
and by day continually, Genesis 4. 14. Cain, though there were none living in the
World, but his own parents and sisters, yet is he afraid, that whosoever met
him would kill him. So it is said of the wicked, Job 18. 11. Terrors shall
make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet. Yea, Psalm. 5^.
5. There were they in great fear where no fear was. 3. When by due trial of
thine own heart, thou can find, that (notwithstanding thy weaknesses) thou
fear God unfeignedly, and these promises belong unto thee; then let not thy
extremities and want of means trouble thee, but rest upon God who is able to
make good his promise. Consider,

1. These extremities are brought on thee for trial of thy faith, as that was
upon Abraham, Genesis 22. 1.

2. The Lord has ways enough to deliver thee, Psalm. 66. 20. To the Lord God
belong the issues of death.

3. The Lords manner has been, to defer his help, till the last pinch; not
to help his people, till they are brought to the brinke of death; so dealt he
with Abraham and Isaac, Genesis 22. 10. When Abraham had stretched forth his hand
and took his knife to slay his son, the Lord stayed him from doing it, and
not before.

3. To comfort and strengthen the poor against murmuring and impatiency in
hard times. Say not, this is my charge, and these are my means; how is it
possible these means should maintain this charge? must I not needs either
steal or famish both I and mine? But, first, consider and meditate what
promises God has made to his people in this case. The eye of the Lord (says
David, Psalm. 33. 18. 19.) is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in
his mercy; to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in
famine. and 34. 10. They that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing; and
37. 19. In the days of famine they shall be satisfied. and 132. 15. I will
abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread. He has
said (says the Apostle, Heb. 13. 5, 6.) I will never leave thee nor forsake
thee; so that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper. He is pleased to bring
thee to this want of means, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove
thee (says Moses unto Gods people, Deuteronomy. 8. 16.) to do thee good at thy latter
end. Secondly, labor to get assurance, that thou art one to whom these
promises do belong, that thou art a belieuer; that thou fear God: for to the
wicked I can promise no sufficiency. No, I can assure them, that (though they
had their houses full of gold, and never so great possessions) yet they may
want and beg, and famish before they die. For, though the Lord in infinite
bounty, do bestow those blessings on wicked men, in great abundance, Psalm. 145.
9. yet can no wicked man be assured of sufficient food and raiment for him and
his, because he has no promise for it; nay, the contrary they have cause to
look for. Thirdly, But if thou be assured that thou art one to whom these
promises do belong, then, 1. Know that God does this to humble thee, Deuteronomy. 8.
2. and labor to find out thy sin, and to make peace with God, Lam. 3. 39. 2.
Know, that God is able to help thee, either by inclining the hearts of the
rich (hard though they be) to show compassion on thee; yea, such as of all
other thou had least hope to receive relief from, (he can make Esau kind to
Jacob, Genesis 33. 15. and the Egyptians bountiful to Israel, Exodus 12. 36.) 3.
If he give thee no better means then thou have, yet he can make them stretch
out, and suffice thee. Daniel and his fellows that did eat nothing but pulse,
and drank nothing but water, were fatter and fairer then all the children that
did eat the Kings meat, Dan. 1. 12, 13. A little that the righteous man has
is better then the riches of many a wicked man, says David, Psa. 37. 16.

But, will God work miracles now?

Yes surely, rather then his promise should fail, that he has made to his
Object.
people, Is my hand shortened, says the Lord? Esa. 50. 2. This resolve upon,
Answ.
2. Chro. 16. 9. The eyes of the Lord run to and fro, throughout the whole
earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them, whose heart is perfect
toward him. And of this also, Mark. 9. 23. All things are possible to him that
belieueth. And therefore be thou confident with Job, Chap. 13. 15. Though he
slay me, yet will I trust in him; and (with the three nobles) to die rather
then to help thy self by unlawful means, Dan. 3. 13.

Lecture the eight, March 21. 1608. JOHN IIII. XII.
IT remains now, that we proceed to the second reason she gives against the
speech of Christ, and that is set down in this Verse; she could not understand
or believe, that Christ could give her any other water, that was better then
the water of that Well, because Jacob gave them that Well, and it was the best
water he could give; for it was the same that himself and his children and
cattle did drink of; and she thought it was not possible, that he could be a
greater or better man then Jacob, or be able to give a better water then he was
able to give; Art thou greater then our father Jacob? says she.

Now; for the better understanding of these words, that so we may receive
instruction and profit by them: three errors are to be observed in this reason
the woman uses; For, 1. Jacob gave not that Well to the Samaritans, but he
gave both it, and that part of the country where it stood, to his son Joseph,
as the Evangelist has said, ver. 5. They and their ancestors were placed in
that country by Shalmaneser the King of Ashur, and not by Jacob, as you shall
see, 2. King. 17. 24. 2. Jacob was not their father, neither according to the
flesh (for you shall read who were the ancestors of whom the Samaritans were
descended, 2. King. 17. 24.) nor according to the spirit, for in this case,
those only were to be accounted the children of Jacob, that were of Jacobs
religion, and walked in his steps, Psalm. 24. 6. This is Jacob. John 8. 39. If
ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. But so did not the
Samaritans, for Jacob never worshipped any Idol nor Image, nor would suffer
any in his family to do it, as ye shall find, Genesis 35. 2. But the Samaritans
worshipped many false gods, 2. Kings 17. 29, 30. and Images, verse 41. 3. Admit
Jacob had been their father, and had given them that Well, yet was Christ able
to give her better water, then that which Jacob gave to his children. And
though Jacob were of great authority and credit in the Church for his faith and
piety, yet was it great ignorance and infidelity in her to prefer him before,
or match him with Christ; or to allege his authority, to the discrediting of
that which Christ had said; for, the grace Jacob had, he had it from Christ,
and he was but a servant, Christ was his Lord, Heb. 3. 5, 6.

The Doctrine then that we are to learn from this reason and argument that the
woman uses against the speech of Christ, is this,

That the credit of good and holy men is often abused by the ignorant and Doct. 3.
wicked to the discredit of Gods truth. This woman alleges not against
Christ, the credit and authority of any of her neighbors, or of their true
ancestors; but Jacob is the man whom she sets against Christ. Yea, the more
holy and virtuous that Jacob was, the stronger she takes her argument to be
against Christ. I will not trouble you with many proofs. Take the example of
the Jews in Christ's time, and you shall find proof enough of this doctrine.
The worthiest men that ever lived in the Church, and such as would have counted
it their happiness to have lived in that time, when God was manifested in the
flesh, as our Savior teaches us, Luke 10. 34. They were ever the men, whose
name and credit was set in opposition against Christ. The Jews often advance the
credit of Abraham and Moses and the Prophets, as if they had been admirers of
their virtues, when they saw that they might thereby discredit Christ and his
Doctrine: John 8. 53. Art thou greater then our father Abraham which is dead?
and the Prophets are dead; whom make thou thy self? and John 9. 28. 29. Be
thou his Disciple, we are Moses Disciples, but this man, we know not from
whence he is. Was Abraham indeed, or Moses, or the Prophets on their side
against Christ? or were they indeed the true children of Abraham, or of the
Prophets? Nothing less; but if any of them had been living, they would have
been as bitter enemies to them, as they were to Christ, and this our Savior
often tells them of, Ye seek to kill me (says he, Ioh. 8. 40.) a man that
has told you the truth, which you have heard of God; this did not Abraham. And
Ioh. 5. 45. There is one that accuses you, even Moses in whom ye trust. And
Mat. 23. 30. He taxes them for gross hypocrisy, because they said, that if
they had been in the days of their fathers, they would not have been partakers
with them in the blood of the Prophets.

The reasons why they did so, and why all wicked men have been so apt to abuse
the name and authority of the most holy and worthy servants of Reason.
God; are principally two.

1. To gain credit to themselves with the people. For, they know that all men
generally have a reverent opinion of such men. This reason is given why the
Pharisees durst say nothing against John, Mat. 21. 26. For, all held John as a
Prophet. Herod himself thought reverently of him, Mar. 6. 20.

2. To secure their own hearts in their errors and sins. The finding of
this little goodness in themselves, that they hate not all good men, but can
think and speak reverently of them, does strangely quiet the conscience of
hypocrites for a time; as that little goodness he found in himself did that
Pharisee, Luke 18. 11.

The Uses of this Doctrine are three. 1. To discover unto us the weak Use 1.
foundations of the Popish faith and religion, which yet I would not be large
in, had I not two reasons to move me to it. 1. That though I see no cause to
doubt that any of you should be inclined that way, yet (partly, the great
increase of Papists of late, and partly, their strange boldness and confidence
in their religion, and readiness to maintain and broach their opinions, in
every company) may cause you sometimes to stagger, and think they have some
truth on their side, if you be not the better grounded and confirmed against
them. 2. My text here gives me direct occasion to do it, yea, more direct, then
any other that I can think of, in all the Scripture. Consider therefore that
as the Papists do resemble the Samaritans, in many other things, so in this
point especially, that is described in this text: namely in advancing the
credit of good and holy men, to the discrediting of the truth of God. The
Papists are right Samaritans, and do resemble them in many things.

1. The Samaritan in many points of Religion agreed with the people of God, for
he worshipped the true God, Ezra 4. 2. 2. King. 17. ^8. He acknowledged the
five Books of Moses; he used Circumcision, and the Sacrifices of the Law, 2.
Kings 17. 32. he looked for the Messiah, that was to come, John 4. 25. So does
the Papist agree with us in many points of Religion.

2. The Samaritan corrupted these parts of the true Religion with gross
Superstition and Idolatry; for he had many things besides the Lord that he gave
divine honor unto, 1. Kings 17. 29. Every nation made gods of their own, and
put them in the houses of the high places, which the Samaritans had made, every
nation in the cities where they dwelt. He worshipped the true God in Images,
These nations feared the Lord, and served their graven images, says the text,
2. King. 17. 41. And in that respect, though the Holy Ghost say of them, 2.
Kings 17. 33. They feared the Lord; because they retained many parts of Gods
true worship, yet in the very next verse he says, They did not fear God, they
did not worship the true God, because they served him not according to his
Word. And our Savior denies, Ioh. 4. 22. that there c^uld be any salvation
had in their religion. In this point also the Papist is like the Samaritan; he
has many petty gods that he gives divine honor unto; he worshippeth the true
God by Images; and in that respect, we may as truly say of him, as it was said
of the Samaritan, he worshippeth not the true God at all, because he
worshippeth him not according to his Word; how then can salvation be found in
the religion of the Papist?

3. The Samaritan was ever the chief practiser against the re-edifying of the
Temple, and of the holy city. See some of their practices, They weakened the
hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building; and hired
Counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus,
as we read, Ezra. 4. 4. 5. And Neh. 6. 12. 14. They made some of the Prophets
and Prophetesses their instruments to hinder the work. So has the Papist ever
been the author of all the means whereby the growth of religion has been
hindered amongst us, The strange slanders, whereby many of the servants of God
have been discredited, both with the Magistrate, and with the people, have
come from the Papist. The domestical dissentions, and iarres we have had among
our selves, have come from the Papist also.

But in nothing, has he better resembled the Samaritan, then in this case that
is here described in this Text: namely, in pretending great love, and respect
to the Saints departed; and in advancing their credit and authority, to the
discredit of the truth of God. The Samaritan pretended great reverence to
Jacob, they pretended for this Well from which they fetched their water, that
Jacob gave it them. The Papist pretends, for the power and authority of their
Pope (from whence in very deed, all their religion is derived, and upon which
it is grounded) that Peter gave it him, that Peter used it himself, and left
it to the Bishops of Rome, that are his successors; and for their whole
religion, they pretend that the ancient Fathers, and Doctors of the Church,
delivered it unto them. And therefore let us bring never so good evidence out
of the Word of God against them, they are ready to put us off, as the Samaritan
does here; Are you, or the founders of your religion (Luther and Calvin)
greater then Saint Peter? Are you or they better or more likely to see the
truth in religion, then all the Fathers who gave us this religion, and
themselves professed it, and all such as were taught by them? We honor the
Fathers (say they) you reject and despise them. The ancient Doctors of the
Church, are for us, and against you, and your new religion.

Now for answer unto them we say, that the very same errors, will be found in
this plea of theirs, as we have found in the argument of this Samaritan-woman;
for, 1. As Jacob gave no such Well to the Samaritanes, so it is evident, Peter
gave no such power and authority to the Bishops of Rome, as they pretend. Mark
how we prove this. 2. He had no such power, and authority himself, as the Pope
exercises. Peter exercised no such temporal and civil jurisdiction, nay, he
might not do it, The king of the Gentiles (says our Savior unto him and the
rest of the Apostles, Luke 22. 25, 26.) exercise lordship over them; and they
that exercise authority upon them, are called Benefactors, But ye shall not be
so. Peter never took upon him, nor thought he might take upon him, to depose
Princes, that should abuse their authority against the true Church and
Religion, or to absolve subjects from their Oaths of allegiance; for he taught
the contrary, submit your selves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake,
says he, 1. Pet. 2. 13. He had no such ecclesiastical supremacy over the
whole Church, as the Pope exercises; for all the rest of the Apostles were
equal to him; Paul professes so of himself, in nothing am I behind the very
chiefest Apostles says he, 2. Cor. 12. 11. The same commission, the same gifts
of the Holy Ghost, the same keys of the kingdom of heaven, and power to bind
and loose, was committed to them all, as was to him, to them all he said as my
father has sent me, so send I you. And when he had said this, he breathed
upon them, and says unto them, receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whosoever sins,
etc. Ioh. 20. 21. 22. 23. He (in respect of his Ministry) is called a rock
upon which Christ says he would build his Church, Matthew. 16. 18. so are all
the Apostles, the wall of the City (the new Jerusalem) had twelve foundations,
and in them the names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb, Reu. 21. 14. Yea,
Peter was so far from exercising any such supremacy over the rest of the
Apostles, that writing to the ordinary Pastors and Elders of the Church, he
makes himself equal to them and calls himself, (...), 1. Pet. 5. 1. and
makes the title of (...) proper to Christ himself, 1. Pet. 5. 4.

2. Though Peter had had such authority, as the Pope exercises, and exercised
it himself, yet follows it not, that the Pope has the like. For, they can
never prove that Peter left the authority that he had to the Bishops of Rome,
or that they are his successors. Mark the proof of our second argument. 1.
They can never prove by the Scripture, that Peter was ever at Rome. Say they
have Ecclesiastical history to prove it; we say, that for a point of religion
so fundamental, it is necessary they should have evident Scripture also. 2.
Their Ecclesiastical history for Peter's being and continuance at Rome (viz.
that he should come thither in the twenty seventh year of Claudius, and tarry
there twenty five years) is expressly contradicted by the Scriptures; For, 1. He
was at Jerusalem three years after Paul's conversion, Gal. 1. 18. and
fourteen years after that, Gal. 2. 1. 2. When Paul sends salutations to the
Church of Rome, he makes no mention of Peter, Romans 16. 3. If Peter had been at
Rome, when Paul was in trouble there, Paul would never have written as he did,
Col. 4. 11. These only are my work-fellowes to the Kingdom of God, which are
found to my consolation, 2. Tim. 4. 16. At my first answering no man assisted
me. If Peter had been then there, would not he have been a comfort to him,
would not he have assisted him in his troubles? 4. Though it were evident that
Peter had been at Rome, and continued there twenty five years, yet could he
not be Bishop of Rome. For, 1. The office of a Bishop or Pastor, is an office
distinct from the office of an Apostle, and inferior also unto it, Ephesians. 4. 11.
2. Peter was specially appointed to be the Apostle of the Circumcision, Gal. 2.
7. And the Jews (in this time that they pretend Peter should be Bishop of
Rome) were banished from Rome, Acts 18. 2.

2. The second error in this plea is this, that they say the Doctors of the
Church are their fathers, that they are for them, and against us, as the
Samaritans said, Jacob was their father. But for our selves, we may say in this
point, 1. We despise not the Fathers, but reverence them highly for their
learning and piety. 2. We esteem them good helps for the understanding of the
Scriptures. 3. We study them, and allege them also in our writings. 4. There
is scarce any matter of moment in religion, which we cannot anouch from some,
or more of them.

On the other side, the Papists do not give unto the Fathers that honor they
pretend to do: For, 1. In many points they renounce their authority. 2. They
prefer Aquinas before the most, or all of them. 3. They match with the
ancient Fathers, sundry bastard and counterfeit fathers. 4. They have foisted
into their writings parts of tracts, and whole treatises, that were never
theirs. 5. They have by their Indices expurgatorij cunningly altered, or razed,
and quite put out many of their sentences and books; and that with strange
impudency, though they have known well, that we have many printed and written
copies to control them by. Of these Indices they have made five already; as
never satisfied with the correcting of the Fathers; Neither do they in these
Indices correct, alter, or raze the prefaces, marginall notes, collections and
observations made out of the Fathers only (as some pretend) but the very texts
of the Fathers also. All this our learned men have made evident to the world in
sundry books.

3. The third error in this plea of the Papists is this, that as the Samaritan
here thought, it was not possible that God should do for any, more then he did
for Jacob, Christ could give no better a water then Jacob did, Christ was not
so great as Jacob: so they think none can see any thing in Religion now, which
the Fathers did not see; yea, they oppose the judgment and authority of the
Fathers against Christ himself, and the manifest testimony of his Word.
Whereas though it were granted, that there are many things in popery, that were
received from the Fathers; and in ours, which the Fathers received not, yet may
that which they hold, be erroneous and evil, and that which we hold, sound and
good for all that; For, 1. Nothing in religion is to be received upon the
authority of the Fathers, unless it have warrant from the Scriptures. They are
not to be admitted as Law-giuers and Authors of opinions in religion, but as
Interpreters of the Scriptures, they are not Judges of the Scriptures, but are
to be examined and judged by them. This we prove, 1. By plain testimony of
the Scriptures, There is no Lawgiver, says the Apostle, Iam. 4. 12. And our
Savior forbids us, Mat. 23. 9, 10. to acknowledge any for a father or master
with such absolute dependence upon him, but his heavenly Father and himself
only. 2. Themselves acknowledge the perfection of the holy Scriptures. 3.
Themselves do disclaim this absolute authority, and hold that they ought not
to be further received, then they bring warrant for that they teach, from the
holy Scriptures. 4. The Fathers themselves do differ one from another, and from
themselves also. 5. They were subject to error, Every man is a liar, says the
Apostle, Romans 3. 4. that i, he is subject unto error, he may be deceived
himself, and he may also deceive others. And indeed the Fathers did mistake in
many things, and erred, (yea, and that very grossly) as the Papists themselves
do confess also. 6. There is no certainty even of the most legitimate books
of the best Fathers; for, heretics have gelded and corrupted them, and
foisted into them their own errors.

2. Though they were holy and learned men, yet it may well be, that the Lord
has revealed that to his servants now, which they saw not; for, the Lord has
often done so, David had more understanding then his teachers had, Psalm. 119. 99.
and the Disciples of Christ saw many truths which many of the Prophets (though
they were (it may be) holier men then they) did not see, Luke 10. 24. Many
points of Gods truth are revealed now, even to babes which the Patriarchs and
Prophets (though holy men, and highly in Gods favor) saw not. It was ever
unlawful to have many wives: for it was forbidden to the King himself, Deuteronomy.
17. 17. to multiply wives. And the Lord in the first institution of wed lock
(when, if ever, there was most use and necessity of polygamy for the
propagation of mankind) made but one woman for one man. And why so? that he
might seek a godly seed, says the Prophet, Mal. 2. 15. Intimating that the
seed and posterity that came by polygamy, could not be holy or pleasing unto
God. Yet neither Jacob, nor David knew, how heinous that sin was. Iephthah
(though a rare man for faith, Heb. 11. 32. yet) understood not the liberty God
had given him by his Law, to redeem his daughter, Leu. 27. 4. nor how lawful
it was for those that were consecrated to God (even for the Nazarite) to marry,
Judge. 11. 35. Josiah is praised for destroying those monuments of idolatry,
that Solomon had set up, though both Solomon himself after his repentance, and
Asa, Iehosaphat, and Hezekiah (all good Kings) saw not the necessity of
destroying them, 2. King. ^3. 12, 13. 2. Many good reasons may be given, why
learned Divines in these days may know more, and have better judgment in
Religion, then the Fathers had. 1. They are borne and bred in the knowledge and
profession of the truth, and have known from their childhood, the holy
Scriptures, which are able to make them wise unto salvation, as the Apostle
speaks of Timothy, 2. Tim. 3. 15. whereas most of the Fathers were bred and
had lived long in Gentilisme and Heresy, before they came to the knowledge of
the truth. 2. They enjoy the benefit both of all the Fathers own labors, and of
the writings of many other learned men also, which the Fathers themselves could
not do. 3. They have the help both of far better translations of the
Scripture, then the Fathers could have, and of the knowledge of the tongues
also, which the chief of the Fathers are well known to have been wanting in.

Thus much for the first use of this Doctrine.

The second Use concerns us all, for this Doctrine serves to admonish us,
that we take heed, we make not an Idol of any man, how holy, or how 2.
good soever he be; which is then done, when we oppose, and set the judgment,
or practice of any man against the Word of God, when we advance the credit of
any man, to obscure the glory of God. Four rules I will give you to direct you
in this case. 1. Rest not so much on the judgment, advice, or example of the
best men, but examine them by the Scriptures. Follow me as I follow Christ,
says the Apostle, 1. Cor. 11. 1. and 1 Thessalonians. 5. 21. prove all things and
hold fast that that is good. For, good men have often proved Satan's instruments
to deceive others, Satan himself did mis-guide David, 2. Sam. 7. 3. and the
young Prophet was dangerously deceived even by the old Prophet, who was also a
good man, 1. King. 13. 18. and Peter played Satan's part in dissuading our
Savior from suffering, Mat. 16. 22. 23. 2. Esteem not of the excellentest man
in the world, when his credit is advanced to obscure Gods glory and truth, see
how contemptibly the Apostle speaks of the most excellent teachers in this
case, 1. Cor. 3. 5, 7. Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos? neither is he that
planteth any thing, neither he that waters. 3. Count it no great sign of
grace to be able to praise and speak well of some good men, if thou do it to
the discredit of that goodness that is in another; to praise one Minister,
with an intent to disgrace and derogate from the credit of thine own Minister,
or of any other. 4. Count it no just cause of comfort to be able to love and
commend some good men, unless thou be careful to imitate their goodness; for
this shall increase thy condemnation, rather then do thee any good.

The third use concerns them, whose judgment and practice men are in 3.
greatest danger to abuse. 1. Desire not, that any should give thee, the honor
that is due to God, as to make thy will, thy judgment, or practice the rule of
his conscience, oh shun this by all means. See two notable examples for thee
to follow in this case, the one of the Apostles Barnabas and Paul, who (when
the men of Lystra would have given divine honor unto them, Act. 14. 13. 15.)
did withal expressions of sorrow, and fear, and indignation, disclaim it,
and put it from them. The other of the twenty four Elders (representing the
whole body of the Militant Church) of whom we read Reu. 4. 10. 11. that they
fell down before him that sat upon the throne, and did worship him, and cast
their crowns before the throne, saying, thou art worthy O Lord to receive
glory and honor. They renounced (before God) their own glory, and ascribed
all glory and honor unto God alone. Remember this is the way to bring
fearful ruin upon thee, when thou shall accept of any honor (such as this
is) as is due to God alone, as we may see in the fearful and shameful end
that came upon Herod, Acts 12. 23. Because he gave not God the glory; but
accepted of, or (at least) endured divine honor to be given unto him. 2. Let
such as are of note for their knowledge and profession, take heed what example
they give: It is the Apostles charge, 1. Cor. 8. 9, 10, 11, 12. 3. Let
superiors especially take heed what example they give, for their inferiors
will be ready to do as they do, though it be to the manifest peril of their
own souls.

THE NINTH LECTVRE, ON MARCH XXVIII. MDCIX.
IOH. IIII. XIII, XIIII. Jesus answered, and said unto her, whosoever drinks
of this water, shall thirst again.

But whosoever drinks of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst:
but the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a Well of water springing
up into everlasting life.


WE have heard in the two former verses, that this poor woman of Samaria could
neither understand, nor believe that which Christ had said unto her, but
reasoned and disputed against it, yet does not our Savior give her over for
this her blockishnesse and infidelity; but as he that came to seek that that
was lost, still continues to labor with her, to bring her to an admiration
and desire of grace; which (taking the present occasion from the Well, where he
now sat, and the water which this woman came to fetch) he calls the water of
life. Now whereas she had falsely boasted, that Jacob was their father, and gave
them that Well, and had asked him, whether he were greater then Jacob: he
neither denies that which she had falsely affirmed, nor is he offended with her
for so odious a comparison; neither does he in plain terms affirm himself
to be greater then Jacob, (because she was not yet fit to hear that, that
might have bred in her some suspicion of vainglory in him, and made her
unwilling to have any further speech with him) but he proves the water that he
had to give (viz. the grace of his holy spirit) to be far more excellent then
the water of that Well, or then any water Jacob had to give, by an argument
taken from a far more excellent effect that this water had, above any other
water in the world besides. As if he should have said, whereas one principal
use that the water of this Well in these hot countries serves for, is to
quench the thirst, (Jacob himself, and his children, etc. did drink of it)
the water that I have to give is far more excellent for this use; for this
water will not so quench the thirst, but a man that has drunk of it, shall
within a while be as thirsty again as if he had never drunk, because the
moisture and coolness thereof will be by the heat that is in him consumed and
dried up: but he that has once drunk of the water that I have to give, shall
be so satisfied with it, as he shall never thirst again, because the cool
moisture that it yields, can never be by any heat dried up; but shall be in
him as a fountain that will never leave springing, till it have brought him to
everlasting life. So that in these words there be three principal points that
offer themselves to our consideration.

1. That as the body, so the soul of every man is subject to a kind of thirst.

2. That no wordly thing can perfectly and fully quench this thirst, that the
soul of man is subject unto.

3. That the spirit of grace, which our Savior calls here, the water of
life, is able fully and perfectly to quench the thirst that the soul of man is
subject unto.

Of these three points we will consider in that order that I have propounded
them in.

And first from this, that our Savior makes this a principal use that the
water of life, the Spirit of God serves unto, to quench the thirst, we learn,
That as the body of man, through the heat that is in it (partly natural,
partly accidental) is subject unto thirst, which if it be extreme, is one of
the most Doct. 1.
painful and intolerable passions, that it endures in this life; so is the
soul of every man, through the heat that it feels when it shall apprehend
the anger of God due to him for sin, subject unto thirst, that is, to such a
desire of comfort against Gods wrath, as is never a whit less, but much more
painful then the thirst of the body is. For the thirst that the body is
subject unto, how intolerable it is when it grows to extremity (though I need
allege no proof but common experience, which has found it to be more violent
and intolerable then hunger is) we may see it in two examples; The one of
Sampson, who though he were so strong and valiant, that he could alone with the
iaw of an ass, slay a thousand Philistims, Judge. 15. 15. yet could he not
vanquish nor endure this passion, but was afraid he should have died of thirst,
and cries earnestly to God for help against it, Judge. 15. 18. And our blessed
Savior, that was never heard to complain of any other bodily torment that he
did endure, He gave his back to the s^iters (as the Prophet speaks, Esa. 50.
6.) and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; he hid not his face
from shame and spitting. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted (Esa. 53. 7.)
yet he opened not his mouth; he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter; and as
a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth. Yet feeling
the extremity of this passion immediately before his giving up the ghost, he
cried out (and that with a loud voice, as may appear by comparing, Mat. 27.
48. with John 19. 28.) I am a thirst.

And that the soul (even the soul of every man first or last) shall be
subject unto thirst, that is, to such a desire of comfort against Gods wrath,
as is painful and intolerable, is most evident. See the proof of it in three
conditions and estates of men. 1. All Gods Elect, those poor and
brokenhearted. ones, that Christ was sent to be a Savior unto, are said to
have had this thirst in them, before they could have any benefit by him: David's
soul panted after God, as the chased Heart does after the water brooks, (Psalm.
42. 1, (...).) his soul thirsted for God. And every one that thirsts (and
none but he) is invited (Esa. 55 1.) to partake of all the comforts of the
Gospel. And he only has a promise to be satisfied with righteousness (to be
comfortably assured of his righteousness before God, which consists in the
pardon of his sins, and the imputation of Christ's righteousness unto him) that
does hunger and thirst after it, Mat. 5. 6 2. Such of the wicked as have bin
most profane and desperate deriders, and contemners of al piety and religion,
have ost (even in this life) had such a sore and intolerable thirst upon them,
that had they had all the kingdoms of the world, they would have given them
for a little comfort against the sense of the wrath of God. See the proof of
this, Amos 8. 11. The Lord speaks of wicked men that shall wander from sea to
sea, and from the North to the East, and shall run to and froto seek some
comfort out of the Word of the Lord, and shall not find it. In that day (says
he) shall the fair virgins and the young men (who for the most part sin with
a high hand in open contempt of piety) perish for thirst. Even such as have
most hardened their hearts against Gods fear; the Lord is able to bring to this
thirst. The mouth of the Lord has spoken this, and his hand has fulfilled it
upon many a one.

3. Such of the wicked as never feel any thirst in this life, but live and die
like senseless beasts (as many thousands doubtless do) shall be sure to feel
it in so much the greater extremity in the life to come. See the proof of this
in Luke 16. 24. The rich man whose life was full of pleasure, and who was all
that while never troubled with this thirst, in hell was so tormented with it,
that he cried for Lazarus (the man against whom he had showed most cruelty) To
dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool his tongue.

The reason of this (if we will enquire into it) we shall find to be this, that
as the extremity of bodily thirst grows from some distemper of heat; so is
Reason.
it also with this thirst of the soul. 1. The sense of sin, and of Gods
anger, has a burning and scorching heat in it. The Lord in respect of his just
anger against sin, is called a consuming fire, Heb. 12. 29. and the sting of
conscience which is wrought by the sense of sin, is compared to the sting of
the fiery serpents, Ioh. 3. 14, 15. which made Job, Chap. 30. 30. say his bones
were burnt with heat.

2. There is no man, but at one time or other (here or in the life to come)
shall be brought to the sense of sin, and of Gods anger provoked by his sin.
The most sleepy, blind, and senseless conscience shall be one day awakened; for
so we read, Eccl. 12. 14. God shall bring every work into judgment, with
every secret thing, whether it be good or evil, and Psalm. 50. 21. I will
reprove thee, and set them in order before thee. Ier. 2. 19. Thine own
wickedness shall correct thee, know therefore and behold that it is an evil
thing and bitter, that thou have forsaken the Lord thy God.

This Doctrine serves to warn every man to provide against this thirst.
Consider, thou must one day feel either the thirst of Gods Elect, or that of
Use.
the Reprobate. Be not so foolish, as to think thou shall never feel any such
heat in thy self; but be assured thou must one day feel what it is to have
offended God. It has been a proverb that men use to put other men's faults in
that part of the wallet that is before them, and have them ever in their eye,
but their own in that part of the wallet that hangs behind them; but be not
deceived, be thou assured, God will turn the wallet one day; thy old sins, the
sins thou have forgotten (if thou have not repented of them) shall be brought
into thy remembrance again; the sins thou foundest most pleasure in, thou
shall feel the bitterness of one day, either here, or in the life to come: It
was thus with Gods dear servant Job, Job 13. 26. Thou writest bitter things
against me, and make me to possess the iniquities of my youth. Then thou
shall feel a thirst in thy soul; and by how much the more thou have despised
piety and religion, the more vehement shall thy thirst be in that day. Provide
for this thirst, I advise thee; choose rather to have David's thirst in this
life, then Dives thirst in the life to come; yea choose rather to bring thy
sins into thy remembrance thy own self, then that the Lord should do it, for,
Heb. 10 31. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
But alas, most men instead of providing for the quenching of this thirst, do
by desperate continuing and increasing in sin, laborall they can to add fuel
to this fire, and increase this thirst, as drunkards use (it is the comparison
the Holy Ghost uses, Deuteronomy. 29. 19.) by all means they can to provoke thirst,
that they may drink the more. But know assuredly, that proportionable to the
number and heinousness of they sins will thy heat and thirst be; and to
these men I may say as Esa. 50. 11. Behold all ye that kindle a fire, that
compass your selves about with sparks, walk ye in the light of your fire,
and in the sparks that ye have kindled; this shall ye have of my hand, ye
shall lie down in sorrow. Say not, this is a hard doctrine, and tends to
terror; mislike it not for that; oh that the Lord would so follow it, and so
press it upon our consciences, that it might work fear in you. Nothing is
more wholesome and profitable for us in this secure age, then this fear, Prou.
28. 14. Happy is the man that fears always. It was profitable for Paul to be
acquainted with the terrors of the Lord, 2. Cor. 5. 11. And if Paul had need
of them, much more have we. This is the mean to keep thee from those
everlasting fears, Hab. 3. 16. I trembled in my self, that I might rest in
the day of trouble.

And thus much for the first part of this Text. The second point to be observed
in it, is the Antithesis that our Savior makes between the water of Jacobs
Well, and the water of life: and this opposition holds true, not between the
water of Jacobs Well only, but between all other things and the water of
life, for he makes it the peculiar and proper effect of the water of life to
quench this thirst. From whence we learn; That no worldly thing Doct. 2.
can perfectly and fully quench the thirst of the soul. I cannot deny but
there be many wicked men, who never tasted of other then worldly comforts, that
may seem to have as much peace and quietness in their conscience, as any man
in the world has, Job 21. 9. Their houses are peaceable and without fear.
Psalm. 73. 5. They are not in trouble as other men are. Luke 11. 21. When the
strong man keeps possession of the house, all things are in peace. Yea, such
as have had this thirst, may seem to have quenched it well, even by worldly
means. Neither do I deny, but that there be many worldly things, that for a
time will seem to slake this thirst, and quiet the heart that is troubled with
the sense of sin, 1. Sam. 16. 23. When David played on the harp, Saul was
refreshed and eased. And our own experience may tell us of some that have had
much trouble of mind for sin, and this vehement thirst, that yet now, by
giving over their precise course, and giving themselves to worldly mirth, are
as quiet in their minds as any man living. Yet can no worldly thing soundly
quench the thirst of the soul, nor satisfy the heart that desires comfort
against the sting of conscience and sense of Gods wrath. And to such as make
such reckoning of worldly helps in this case, I may say as Esa. 55. 2. Why do
you labor for that which satisfies not? For as the promise is made only to
the godly, Psalm. 8^. 8. He will speak peace to his people and to his Saints.
So of every wicked man it is said, Esa. 57. 21. There is no peace to the
wicked; yea of every natural man, Romans 3. 17. The way of peace they have not
known. What shall we say then to the peace of wicked men? Surely either it
grows from senslesnesse, they never yet knew what sin is; they never felt
the heat of the sting of conscience, and sense of Gods anger; and then how can
it be said, their thirst is quenched that never felt any thirst? Their case is
described, Esa. 29. 8. A man dreameth, and lo he is drinking, but when he
awakeneth, behold he is faint, and his soul longs. 2. Or else, if ever they
had this heat, and felt this thirst, the peace and joy they seem to have, is
in the face only, and not in the heart, 2. Cor. 5. 12. Do you not think that
many a man that makes show of great iollity and mirth, has his inward
stingings and gripes of conscience. 3. Or if ever they had this thirst, and
have now quenched it with worldly comforts, they shall surely thirst again,
and that in a more vehement and intolerable manner then ever they did before.
See this judgment threatened against them, that make up the breach that God
has made in their conscience with untempered mortar. Ezech. 13. 13. Therefore
thus says the Lord God, I will even rent it (the wall that was thus daubed
with untempered mortar) with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an
ouerflowing shoure in mine anger, and great hailestones in my fury to consume
it.

The Reasons of this Doctrine are these. Reason. 1.


1. If there were never so good su^iciency in worldly comforts, yet cannot a
man be sure to have them, when he shall stand most in need of them, for the
satisfying of the thirst of his soul, for the Lord deals often with men in this
case as he dealt with Jacob, Genesis 32. 24. he wrestleth with them, and smites
them in the night, and when they are alone; when neither their companions, nor
other means of worldly comfort are at hand.

2. Say a man enjoy them in great abundance, yet in that case, a man shall not
be able to relish them, or feel any comfort in them. See an experiment of 2.
this, when God had awakened the conscience of Belshazzar, and summoned him to
judgment, and thereby smitten his heart with deadly terrors, Dan. 5. 5. 6.
neither the vine, nor any of the exquisite dainties, nor all the pleasant
compahe had at his great feast, could yield him any comfort, he could relish
no sweetness in them, yea by how much the more, a man has delighted in them,
in former times by so much the more, he is wont to distaste, refuse, and ab
horre them in this case. The soul in that case is apt t^ refuse these
comforts, and to loath them, Psalm. 77. 2. That which the Prophet says of gold
and silver, Ezekiel. 7. 19. that in the day of extreme anguish men can take no
comfort in them, but shall be willing to cast them into the street, and put
them out of their sight; the same may likewise be said of all worldly comforts.
Merry talk and music at that time, will be but as the casting of vinegar
upon nitre, as Solomon speaks, Pro. 25. 20. So that a man may fitly compare
all these comforts, to that broken staff or reed, mentioned, 2 Reg. 18. 21.
Upon which if a man lean, it will go into his hand and pierce it.

3. Say a man in this case enjoyed all worldly comforts, and did also esteem
as much of them then as ever he did; yet is it not possible they should be
sufficient, to quench the thirst, that is caused by the sense of Gods anger;
for God only is able to cure the wounds that he has made, he makes sore and
binds up (says Eliphaz, Job 5. 18.) he wounds, and his hands make whole.
So that, that which is said of riches, Pro. 11. 4. may be said of all other
worldly comforts, They avail not in the day of Gods wrath.

The use of this doctrine, is not to work despair, or dismay any whose hearts
desire is to please God; for to their comfort I may say as Ezra 10. 2. Use.
There is hope in Israel concerning this, Zach. 13. 1. There is a fountain
opened to the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and
for uncleanness. But to exhort every man 1. To make less account of all worldly
comforts, and to esteem better of the water of life. I deny not, but we may
take comfort in these things, 1 Timothy 6. 17. they are given to us in abundance
to enjoy. But we must take heed of trusting in them, or making them our only
comfort. Consider what the Apostle writes, 1 Cor. 7. 29. 31. They that have
wives should be as though they had none; and they that rejoice as though they
rejoiced not; and they that bay as though they possessed not; and they that use
this world as not ouer-using it; for the fashion of this world passes away. We
should use also the comforts of this life with so indifferent a mind, that
they be no clogs unto us, to hinder us in the way unto a better life. Oh the
misery of them that have no comfort, but in their wealth, or in their company,
or in their pleasures. To them we may say as Psalm. 4. How long will ye love
vanity, and follow after leasing? Jonah 2. 8. They that observe these lying
vanities forsake their own mercy.

2. To get (without delay) assurance to our souls of our interest in Christ
(from whom only this water of life which quenches the thirst of the soul, is
to be had) according to the counsel of the Psalmist, Psalm. 2. 12. Kiss the
Son least he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled
but a little, blessed are they that put their trust in him.

Lecture the tenth, April 4. 1609. JOHN IIII. XIIII.
IT follows that we proceed to the third point, which I told you was to be
observed in this and the former verse, namely, That the Spirit of grace, which
our Savior here calls the water of life, is able fully and perfectly to
quench this thirst that the soul of man is subject to; for our Savior here
says, that whosoever drinks of the water that he would give him, should
never thirst: and gives a reason why he can never be a thirst again. The
water that I shall give him, shall be in him a Well of water, springing up into
everlasting life.

Now (that we may build upon a sure foundation) we must call to mind that which
I told you (in the handling of the 10. Verse) that by this water of life, is
meant the Spirit of God. This was then proved evidently by two places, Esa. 44.
3. I will power water upon the thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground, I will
power my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thy buds, and Ioh. 7. 38.
He that belieueth in me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of water of life.
Verse 39. This spoke he of the spirit, which they that believed in him, should
receive. So that when our Savior says here, whosoever drinks of the water
that I shall give him, shall never thirst, it is, as if he should have said
thus in plainer terms, Whosoever shall receive the Spirit of regeneration
which I shall give him, and which none can receive, but by me, and through my
merits, shall never be more a thirst; that is, he shall not only obtain sound
and perfect peace in his conscience against the apprehension of Gods wrath due
to his sins; but this peace and comfort of his conscience shall never die nor
decay in him, he shall never fall into a deadly thirst again; nor into that
painful and intolerable desire of comfort against Gods wrath, that he was
subject to before? For, that seed of God, and Spirit of regeneration which he
has received of me, can never be dried up or wasted, but will still in all
temptations and afflictions, yield him comfort and satisfaction, and peace of
conscience, and never leave him, till it have brought him unto eternal life.

The words then contain in them a commendation of the water of life, the
spirit of grace and regeneration. 1. From the efficacy and sufficiency of it;
it is able to quench the thirst of the soul. 2. From the durablenesse and
perpetuity of it; where once it is received, it will never be wasted or dried
up.

First then from this, that our Savior says, that he that drinks of the
water that he shall give him, yea whosoever (how thirsty soever his soul were
before) drinks of the water he shall give him, shall never be more a thirst; we
learn,

That the Spirit of grace and regeneration, wheresoever it is received, Doct. 3.
quenches the thirst of the soul, satisfies and quieteth the conscience,
against the sense of Gods wrath.

Before I confirm this Doctrine, I will clear it and make it plain by
answering two objections that may be made against it.

Such as have the Spirit of God, do yet still thirst after grace, and have
Object. 1.
an incredible desire to increase it, as both the Scripture, and daily
experience does prove: yea there was never any that truly tasted of the
sweetness of Gods Word and grace, but they will still long after it, and
think they can never have enough of it, in this life, 1 Pet. 2. 2. As newborn babes they desire the sincere milk of the Word, that they may grow
thereby. See an experiment of this in David his affection to the Word, and
desire to learn it, was every whit as vehement, as if he had scarce learned
the first Principles of it, Psalm. 119. 12. 19. 33, 34. and verse 10. My soul
breaks for the longing it has to thy judgments, at all times. How is it
then said here that they that have drunk of this water, shall never thirst
again?

I answer. The thirst, which our Savior says, he shall never feel again,
that drinks of the water of life, is extreme and painful, hurtful, and
Answ.
such as causes death; as the thirst of the body will, if it be extreme; but
the thirst of the godly, is wholesome, and a sure sign of a sound and
healthful soul, as in the body, it is a sign of health, when one has an
appetite to his meat and drink. And Physicians observe it for a sign, that
their Physic has wrought well, and that the body is sufficiently purged,
when the patient grows thirsty. 2. It is not extreme and painful, but they
find a swetnesse and pleasure and satisfaction in it: So David that Psalm. 63.
1. professed his longing after the public worship of God, does yet, ver. 3. 4.
acknowledge that he was not without great satisfaction even in the want of
those public ordinances of God. Because thy loving kindness is better then
life (says he) my lips shall praise thee. Thus will I bless thee while I
live; I will lift up my hands in thy name.

Secondly, it may be objected, that many of the godly, are subject, even to
that kind of thirst, that is painful; are troubled and disquieted, in their
Object. 2.
mind and conscience, with the sense of Gods indignation. The Prophet
complains of this, Psalm. 88. 7. Thine indignation lies upon me, and thou
have vexed me with all thy ways. How is it then true that our Savior says
here, Whosoever drinks of the water, that I shall give him, shall never
thirst.

I answer, that their thirst, is not deadly, nor extreme, though in their own
sense it seems so to be; but even as it is with the wicked, that they think
Answ.
their state better then indeed it is, Esa, 29. 8. As the thirsty man that
dreameth he is drinking, and when he awaketh behold his soul is faint for
thirst. So in the time of tentation, the godly (as one in a dream) thinks
himself much drier, then indeed he is. For the Spirit of God and that grace
that is in him, sustaineth him, so as he faints not, nor perishes in this
thirst. When he knows not what to pray, the Spirit helps him, Romans 8. 26.
Even then when he seems so tormented with the sense of Gods wrath, he is
assured of Gods favor, though he feel it not. See a plain proof of this in
David, Psalm. 22. 1. Though to his sense God had forsaken him, yet he had the
spirit of prayer even then, even the spirit of adoption, that made him able to
pray and even to cry, My God, my God.

So that now you see the meaning of the doctrine, that every one that has the
Spirit of God, can never have in his soul that thirst that is painful and
extreme, that is hurtful and deadly, but the grace of regeneration
wheresoever it is, satisfies and quieteth the conscience, works in it that
peace of God which passes all understanding, Phil. 4. 7. and that joy which is
glorious and unspeakable, 1 Pet. 1. 8.

So that though the reward and comfort, that accompanies godliness in this
life, be nothing in comparison of that, that is prepared for it in heaven, when
it shall be said unto us, Mat. 25. 23. Enter into thy masters joy, for 1 Cor.
2. 9. Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither has entered into the heart of
man, the things which God has prepared for them that love him. There only, we
shall be perfectly freed from all thirst, then shall we neither hunger nor
thirst any more, Apoc. 7. 16. then shall we be satisfied with the likeness of
God, Psalm 17. 15. yet even in this life, it yields marvelous comfort, and
peace to the conscience. See the proof of it in three points.

1. There is not any one duty of piety that is performed with a good heart, but
it uses to yield presently, a sweet satisfaction and contentment to the
conscience, that makes it say, I am glad I have done this. Our Savior says
after, verse 34. that it was his meat to do the will of God, 1 Chronicles. 29. 9.
The people rejoiced, when they offered willingly, for they offered with a
perfect heart. This we shall find in our prayers, even in those we have powered
out in greatest bitterness of soul. See the comfort David found in that
prayer which he began in great heaviness of spirit, Psalm. 6. 8. Depart from me
(says he) all ye workers of iniquity, for the Lord has heard the voice of my
weeping; the Lord has heard my supplication, the Lord will receive my prayer.

2. True godliness and uprightness of heart does not only yield comfort for
the present, but it makes the heart truly joyful and comfortable at all
times; that though most men judge, that the life of a Christian is the most
tedious and uncomfortable life in the world; the entering into this profession,
is a bidding adue to all mirth and joy; yet as our Savior said to his
Disciples here, verse 32. so may a Christian say to these, I have joy that you
know not of, Pro. 14. 10. No stranger can meddle with, or skill of our joy. The
man that truly fears God, has that joy that he would not give a dragm of it
for a pound of thy joy, as you may see in that speech of David, Psalm. 4. 7.
thou have put gladness in my heart, (says he) more then (they have, then
worldlings have) in their time that their corn and their wine increased. It is
true that the godly have their dumpes sometimes, and fits of heaviness; but 1.
Though they do not for the present joy, yet they shall be sure to find
comfort in the end, Psalm. 97. 11. Light is sown for the righteous, and
gladness for the upright in heart. 2. When they bethink themselves well, of
their own estate, and by due trial of themselves, find that they have in
themselves this Well of water that Christ here speaks of; that the seed of God
abides in them; then do they check themselves for being so uncomfortable, as
David does, Psalm. 42. 11. and find they have just cause not to be sad, but to
rejoice, and to be of good cheer. That whereas wicked men, the less they
look into their own hearts, and think of their estate, the merrier they are;
it is quite contrary with the godly man, Gal. 6. 4. Let every man prove his
own work, and then he shall have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in
another.

Thus I have made this second point plain unto you, let us now prove and
confirm it in a word or two. The Spirit of God is called, Psalm. 45. 7. the
oil of gladness; because it makes a man to look cheerfully; therefore also
it is said, Pro. 29. 6. In the transgression of an evil man, there is a snare,
but the righteous does sing and rejoice. See an experiment of this in Paul, 2
Cor. 1. 12. Our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in
simplicity and godly pureness, and not in fleshly wisdom, but by the grace
of God, we have had our conversation in the world, yea he says, 1 Cor 9. 15.
He would rather die, then loose this rejoicing, that he found in the testimony
of a good conscience.

The third and last point, wherein the truth of this doctrine appears, is
this, that even in the evil day, when all other comforts will fail a man;
(...).
when most tokens of Gods anger shall be upon a man, and Satan shall be
busiest with him, and his own weak heart, shall be most subject to fear,
and to that thirst we heard of the last day; even in that day, this water of
life, an upright heart, and a godly life, will yield unspeakable boldness and
security, peace, and comfort, to the conscience of a man. And well fare that
comfort that will stick by a man, and show it self most; when a man shall
have most need of it. Solomon commends a true friend by this note, a friend
loves at all times says he, Proverbs 17. 17. It is much to the commendation
of good works that that Daniel said to Nebuchadnezzar when he would direct
him how to escape that temporal judgment, and fearful plague, that God had
threatened; he tells him, this was the way, Daniel 4. 24. Break off thy
sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor,
if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity. Good works will prevent and
keep off Gods judgments: But good works will do much more then so; they
will free the conscience from fear in the evil day, they will work peace and
comfort in the heart, in the day of anguish and tentation, Psalm 112. 4. Unto
the upright there arises light in darkness, Proverbs 28. 1. The wicked flee
when no man pursues, but the righteous is bold as a Lion. Such a one is like a
house built upon a rock, no winds, nor floods can hurt him, Matthew 7. 24, 25.
Therefore Paul speaking of the spiritual armor, whereby we may be made able
to stand in the evil day, names righteousness for the brestplate, Ephesians
6. 14. See the experiment of this in Job 6. 10. Yet this comfort I have (though
I burn with sorrow and he spares me not) that I have not denied the words
of the holy one. And that makes the Apostle say, James 2. 13. Mercy rejoices
against judgment.

The Reason why the water of life, has such virtue to quench Reason.
the thirst of the soul; Is, for that the spirit applies the merits of
Christ, unto the conscience. A godly life assures us, that Christ and his
merits belong unto us indeed. For (to speak properly) Christ only is the
refuge against this tempest, and shadow against this heat, as he is called,
Esaias 25. 4. and his blood is that drink that quenches this thirst, and
satisfies the soul. John 6. 55. My Flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is
drink indeed, and verse 35. He that comes to me shall not hunger, and he
that believes in me shall not thirst. It is not our own righteousness that
can shade us from the heat of Gods wrath, but the righteousness of Christ
only. Therefore Paul desired that he might be found in him, not having his
own righteousness, Phil. 3. 9. and Nehemiah 13. 22. Spare me according to
the greatness of thy mercy. But forasmuch as Christ's righteousness is without
us, the spirit is that that applies it to us, and unites us to him; and a
godly life is that that assures us, that our faith is a true and living, not a
false and dead faith, 1. John 3. 7. He that does righteousness, is righteous,
even as he is righteous. Therefore this also is said to quench the thirst. In
which respect good works are also called a foundation. 1. Tim. 6. 19.

The Use of this Doctrine is; First, for the satisfying of all men Use 1.
in the question between us and the Papists touching good works, and for the
conuincing them of slander; you hear what we grant. 1. That good works, are
marueilously profitable, godliness is profitable unto all things, says the
Apostle, 1. Timothy 4. 8. 2. That they are also so necessary, that no man can
be saved without them. Only we deny; first, that they can justify us before
God: secondly, that they can merit heaven, or a far meaner reward then heaven
is, at Gods hands.

2. To admonish all men to seek grace and the fear of God. 1. All men desire
joy, and esteem it the only felicity; they abhor 2.
sadness and sorrow as the devil; but be not deceived, do what thou can,
hunt after these delights as greedily as thou can, yet will God make thee one
day know and feel what thou have done, for all these things God will bring
thee unto judgment, Ecceles. 11. 9. and then shall thy heart be made sad, Luke
6. 25. Woe be to you that laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep. 2. Oh
seek for sound and true joy, such as may make thy heart glad and comfortable,
when thou shall have most need of comfort. Thou must come to be one day in that
case that Hezekiah was in, labor that thou may have that comfort, that he
then had, when the message was brought him from God that he must die and not
live, and he by examination of his own heart, and fervent prayer, sought to
prepare himself for death, this was that that he found comfort in, in that
case, remember now O Lord I beseech thee (says he, Esaias 38. 3.) how I have
walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which
is good in thy sight. The uprightness of his heart and constant care he had to
please God in all his ways yielded him comfort in that estate. If thy
conscience shall say in that day, as Psalm. 90. 9. All our days are passed away
in thy wrath. If thou never had in thy life any good evidence of Gods
special favor: Oh, how great will thy misery then be? 3. Flatter not thy
self with this conceit, that Christ died for thee, and thou beleeuest in
Christ; for if thou have not the Spirit of Christ, thou art none of his, Romans
8. 9.

3. To encourage such as begin inwardly and unfeignedly to affect good things;
let not the scorns of others, nor the difficulties 3.
thou find in a good course discourage thee; for thou shall find the
sweetness of it one day. That which Solomon says of one, may be said of all
good duties. Thou shall find it after many days, Ecclesiastes 11. 1. and 1.
Corinthians 15. 58. Be ye steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the
work of the Lord, for as much as you know, that your labor is not in vain in
the Lord.

4. To reprove such Christians, as yield too much to the dumpishnesse and
heaviness of their own hearts. I do not 4.
wish men that fear God to give too much liberty to themselves, in hunting
after carnal joy, or the means thereof; after recreations, and keeping
company with profane men. Of such mirth, we may say as Eccl. 2. 2. I said of
laughter, it is mad, and of mirth what does it?

I know the best Christians have oft-times just cause to be sad, 1. In respect
of their own sins. 2. In respect of the state of the Church of God, If I do
not remember Jerusalem, let my tongue clean to the roof of my mouth; if I
prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy says the Prophet, Psalm. 137. 6. But
if such, as are indeed in the state of grace, and continue not in any one sin
wittingly, which they have not repented of, do not stir up themselves to be
joyful and comfortable, they are in a great fault. The Lord would have such to
be cheerful, Rejoice evermore says the Apostle, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 16. and
Philippians 4. 4. rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say rejoice. The
Lord would have such to be merry at work and merry at meat, Deuteronomy. 12. 18. Thou
shall rejoice before the Lord thy God, in all that thou put thine hand
unto. And if they be not cheerful, they offend much.

For first, they sin against God, who delights most in the service that is
done to him with cheerfulness, and with a glad heart. God loves as well a
cheerful worshipper as a cheerful giver, 2. Corinthians 9. 7. That was the
cause why Anna abstained from the sacrifice, because she could not be
cheerful, 1. Sam. 1. 7. Mark what account God makes of this, Deuteronomy. 28. 47.
Because thou seruedst not the Lord thy God with ioyfulnesse, and with gladnsse
of heart for the abundance of all things; therefore shall thou serve thine
enemies in hunger and in thirst, etc.

2. They sin against themselves, both against their bodies, in making them
more unserviceable to their souls in any good duty, Prou. 17. 22. A merry
heart does good, like a medicine: but a broken spirit dries up the bones. And
against their souls in making them less able to resist Satan's tentations,
Neh. 8. 10. The joy of the Lord is your stre^h.

3. Against men, in causing them to think very hardly of Religion, as of that,
that will deprive a man of all the comfort of his life, and cast him into
continual melancholy, and doubts, and sadness of heart.

Lecture the eleventh. April 11. 1609.
WE have heard the last day, that this verse contains in it, a commendation of
the water of life (the Spirit of regeneration) from two arguments, viz. first
from the efficacy and sufficiency of it, it is able to quench the thirst of
the soul, and fully to satisfy and quiet it; secondly, from the durablenesse
and perpetuity of it. The first of these we finished the last day; Now it
remains that we come to the second. From this then that our Savior says
here, 1. Whosoever shall drink of the water that he shall give him, shall
never be more a thirst. 2. That the water that he shall give shall be in him
that has once received it, a Well of water springing up to everlasting life.

We learn: That he that has once truly received the Spirit of grace, can
never lose it. Before I confirm this Doctrine Doct. 4.
to you, I will first clear the meaning of it unto you. For it may seem an
absurd and incredible Doctrine, contrary to reason, contrary to sense and
experience, to say, that a man that is once regenerated, and has received
grace, can never lose it. I will show you therefore how far forth we grant,
that a man may lose the good things he has had.

1. There be certain gifts of the spirit that may be lost, viz. outward 1.
gifts, whereby men are fitted to the outward duties of their calling. The
Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul. 1. Sam. 16. 14. But what was that Spirit
of the Lord? The spirit of prophecy, 1. Sam. 10. 10. and the spirit of
government, 1. Sam. 11. 6. but it is the spirit of Sanctification, of which we
say, it cannot never be lost.

2. There be certain shows of sanctification, and reformation 2.
which are the fruits of nature, and they may be lost. A natural man does
oft-times many good things. 1. Out of a carnal respect to his credit, that he
might be well thought of; so did the Pharisee and hypocrite pray and fast, and
give alms, Mat. 6. 2. 6. 15. 2. Sometimes out of a servile fear of Gods wrath,
while he is under the whip, ye shall have him cease from sin, speak many good
words, seem very religious, Psalm. 78. 34. When he slew them, then they sought
him, etc. Now in these good things, there is no durablenesse or constancy, For
all flesh is grass, 1 Pet. 1. 24. Whatsoever excellency is in it, or comes
from it, has no durablenesse in it. But of true sanctification, that comes of
grace, we affirm that it can never be lost.

3. A man that has only tasted of this wate^ ^f life, and received certain
fragments, and superficial beginnings of true sanctification 3.
and grace, may fall quite away and lose them. Heb. 6. 4, 5. Such as have been
enlightened, and tasted of Christ and of the good word of God, and powers of
the world to come, and have been partakers of the Holy Ghost, may fall away.
2. Pet. 2. 20. 22. Such as had escaped from the filthiness of the world,
through the acknowledgement of the Lord, and of the Savior, may be entangled
therein again, and overcome, so as that their latter end may become worse then
ever their beginning was. But he that has not only tasted, but drunk a sound
draught of this water of life and let it down can never lose it, never cast it
up again.

4. A man that has not only tasted, but drunk of this water of life, 4.
and truly received the Spirit of sanctification; may seem to have lost it
sometime; for he may decay for a time, in the measure of grace, and lose the
heat, and feruency of the spirit, that once he had, as Christ complains of
the Angel of the Church of Ephesus, he had left his first love, Apoc. 2. 4. 2.
He may for a time lose the comfortable feeling and assurance of grace, and be
in his own sense, as a man utterly void of grace. This was the case of the
Spouse of Christ, Cant. 3. 1. 2. and 5, 6. Her well-beloued was gone. 3. He
may lose for a time, the power and e^icacie, and operation of grace, and fall
into as gross sins, as any other man. David and Peter may be examples of
this: yea, the best are in great and continual danger to fall thus, if they
take not great heed unto themselves. Nay, it is a very hard thing for any of
Gods children to keep themselves from these decays. Therefore are those
exhortations so often used, 1. Cor. 10. 12. Wherefore let him that thinks he
stands, take heed least he fall, Heb. 12. 15. Looking diligently least any
man fail of the grace of God, least any root of bitterness springing up,
trouble you, and thereby many be defiled, Phil. 2. 12, 13. Wherefore, my
beloved, as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only, but now much
more in my absence; work out your salvation with fear and trembling. For it
is God that works in you both to will, and to do, of his own good pleasure.
You see then, how even they that have indeed drunk of this water of life, may
seem to have it quite dried up in them. But yet though this seem so, it is
not so indeed: for in all those three cases I have mentioned, ye shall see the
children of God that had drunk of this Water of life, they had in themselves
this Well of water, they had grace in them even then, when they seemed to have
lost it. There is soundnes of grace in many a one that is much decayed in
zeal, as is plain in the case of that Angel of Ephesus, Apoc. 2. 2, 3.
Notwithstanding this his delay in his first love, the Lord knew (approved of)
his works and commends him for his labor and his patience, and for this
that he could not bear with them that were evil, and that he tried them that
said they were Apostles and were not, that he had borne and had patience, and
for his names sake had labored and had not fainted. 2. There is much grace in
many a one, that have lost for a time their feeling, as is plain in the
example of the Spouse, Cant. 5. 6. She grieves, and never gives over seeking,
till she had found her beloved. 3. There remains grace in the regenerate,
even then, when they have fallen most fearfully. Whosoever is borne of God
(says the Apostle, 1 Ioh. 3. 9.) does not commit sin; for his seed remains
in him, and he cannot sin, because he is borne of God, the seed of God
remains in him, and therefore he cannot sin, as other men do, he cannot
sin with the full consent of his will, with the full sway of his soul as
before he did. This is evident in the example of David, for when he complains
as if he had quite lost the spirit, Psalm. 51. 11, 12. Even then he prays, and
prays so, as he could never have done, if he had not had the spirit of grace
in him. For how can men call upon him, in whom they have not believed says the
Apostle, Romans 10. 14. and Romans 8. 26. it is the spirit it self that makes
intercession for us and makes us able to pray.

Having thus cleared the Doctrine, let us hear how it may be confirmed. Let us
hearken unto some plain and pregnant testimones of holy Scripture to prove
this, that whosoever has truly received the Spirit of grace can never lose
it, Psalm. 15. When David had spoken of sundry fruits of regeneration, he
concludes the Psalm thus, verse 5. He that does these things, shall never be
moved, Psalm 19. 9. The fear of the Lord is clean and endures for ever,
Psalm. 23. 6. Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my
life. So he that hears the Word and does it, is compared to a house that is
built upon a rock, which no rain, nor floods, nor winds (nor tentations how
strong soever) can overthrow, Matthew. 7. 24. 25. And Luke 8. 13. 15. Though the
other hearers believe but for a time, yet he that with an honest and good
heart, hears the Word shall keep it, John 6. 56. He that eats my flesh,
and drinks my blood, abides in me. In which respect, saving grace is
called, The good part that shall not be taken away, Luke 10. 42. The immortal
seed, 1. Peter 1. 23. and was fitly resembled by that fire that came down
from heaven, that never went out, Leuit. 6. 12.

The Reasons of this are principally three.

1. The unchangeableness of Gods love and decree. No man has Reason. 1.
received the Spirit, but only such as God has elected to salvation, and
loved in Christ before all worlds, Romans 8. 30. Whom he predestined, them he
called, and none but them, Acts 13. 48. So many as were ordained to eternal
life, believed. Therefore true faith is called, Titus 1. 1. The faith of Gods
Elect. A man may make his election sure this way, 2. Pet. 1. 10. Now such as
are elected, cannot possibly fall away, this our Savior speaks of as of a
thing utterly impossible. The false Christ's and false Prophets shall show so
great signs and wonders that they shall deceive, if it were possible the very
elect, faith lie, Matthew. 24. 24. The love of God in Christ is unchangeable,
Ier. 31. 3. I have loved thee with an everlasting love, says the Lord,
therefore in mercy have I drawn thee. Whom Christ loves, John 13. 2. he loves
unto the end. And those that come to him (that is, which believe in him, John
6. 35.) he will never cast away, John 6. 37. The gifts and calling of God
(says the Apostle, Rom 11. 29.) that is, such gifts of God, as accompany an
effectual calling, are without repentance. Every good and perfect gift (says
the Apostle, I am. 1. 17.) and what he means by the perfect gift, he expounds
verse 18. viz. the grace of regeneration; is from above, and comes down from
the Father of lights, in whom is no variableness, neither shad^w of changing.
Though we be wonderfully unconstant and changeable, yet is there not so much
as a shadow of changeableness in the Lord in this case. Insomuch as we may
conclude this first reason with the words of the Psalmist in Psalm 118. 2, 3,
4. Let Israel now say: that his mercy endures for ever. Let the house of Aaron
now say: that his mercy endures for ever. Let them now that fear the Lord,
say: that his mercy endures for ever.

2. The power that is in God to perform what he has promised, 2.
1. Peter 1. 5. We are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.
And this reason our Savior gives in John 10. 28. They shall never perish,
neither shall any pluck them out of my hands, verse 29. My Father which gave
them me, is greater then all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my
Fathers hands. For any strength that is in us (alas) we might fall quite away
every day, considering the temptations that we are subject to; but this power
of God, is that, that keeps us from falling irrecouerably, Psalm. 37. 24.
Though he fall, he shall not be cast off, for the Lord puts under his
hand. We our selves are apt enough (alas) to lose that grace we have
received, but the power of God preserves us, and the weaker we are, the more
is Gods power glorified in preserving us. To which purpose that may be
applied, 2. Cor. 4. 7. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the
excellency of the power may be of God and not of us, and 2. Cor. 12. 9. My
grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness.

3. The prayer and continual intercession that Christ makes for us. For 3.
as he prayed for Peter (and that was the cause why he, though he fell
grievously, yet he lost not all grace, Luke 22. 31, 32.) so he has prayed for
all the faithful, John 17. 20. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them
also, which shall believe on me through their word. And this is a principal
part of the prayer that he made for them, verse 11. Keep them in thy name,
even them whom thou have given me, verse 15. I pray not that thou should
take them out of the world, but that thou keep them from evil. And this
intercession is continual, Heb. 7. 28. He is able perfectly to save such as
come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them. And
these are the Reasons why though we fall, we cannot loose quite that grace that
we have received.

The Use that this Doctrine serves unto, is,

1. To work in us a love and desire of grace, and the means of grace. In
worldly things we love certainties and perpetuities; therefore (though there be
more use of ready money for the present) yet men rather desire land then money.
Behold, there is no certainty nor durablenesse in any blessing but this. Our
Savior calls all the profits of this life, another man's goods, (because we have
no certainty, but they may (we know not how soon) be taken from us, and
bestowed on another) but grace he calls our own, Luke 16. 12. Therefore nothing
but grace only can be called durable riches, Prou. 8. 18. Therefore our
Savior says, Ioh. 6. 27. Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for
the meat which endures unto everlasting life. Indeed if it were true (as the
Papists and some others say) that grace may be lost, there were the less cause
to desire it: for what inward peace or joy, could we have in this case without
certainety? but this ministers unspeakable comfort to the soul, that when we
once know we have grace, we may be sure, we shall never loose it. And as I said
this should make us in love with grace; so should it with the means of grace,
even the ministry of the Word, which is called the ministration of the spirit,
2. Cor. 3. 8. We read of the foolish Virgins when they came to their fellows
to ask some oil, they received this answer, Matthew. 25. 9. Go ye to them
that sell, and buy for your selves. Behold, we are they that fell this oil:
there is no man here so void of grace, but may conceive assured hope to obtain
it, if he can submit himself as he ought to the means of grace, Esaias 55. 3.
Hear and your souls shall live. And therefore if God shall begin now, or at
any time to touch, and draw thine heart, struggle not against this work of his
(as many do) Heb. 3. 7, 8. To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your
hearts as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness.
Stand not our against God, but yield thy self, and say to him as Cant. 1. 4.
Draw me, and we will run after thee.

2. To exhort every man, to try the good things that are in him, whether they
be of nature, or grace. This duty we are often exhorted to, 2. Cor. 13. 5.
examine your selves (says he) whether ye be in the faith, prove your selves,
especially when we are to renew our Covenant with God in the Sacrament, 1. Cor.
11. 29. To persuade thee to this duty: Consider, 1. There may be good things in
a natural man. Say not with thy self, I have some good things in me, and
therefore I have the Spirit of God, because the Scripture says, of them that
are mere natural men, that of them there is not one that does good, no not
one, Romans 3. 12. that we are not sufficient of our selves to think a good
thought, 2. Cor. 3. 5. And the Apostle says of himself that he knew that in
him, that is, in his flesh (in his vnregeneratc part, and so far forth as he
was a natural man) there dwells no good thing, Romans 7. 18. Deceive not thy
self by the misunderstanding of these places. For though it be true, that no
natural man can do any thing that is truly good pleasing unto God, (a
corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit, says our Savior, Matthew. 7. 18.)
yet may there be in a mere natural and carnal man, such things as are
naturally and in themselves good things and commanded of God. I tell thee,
there may be good things in a natural man, who besides the corruption of
nature, has also some remnants of Gods Image in him. Every man that comes
into the world has some light in him, John 1. 9. Every man is made after the
similitude of God, Iam. 3. 9. 2. It will yield thee unspeakable comfort, if
thou can find by due trial that thou have indeed received the Spirit of
God, Gal. 6. 4. But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have
rejoicing in himself, and not in another. The more precious this treasure is,
the more need thou have to take heed thou be not deceived in it. As the wise
Merchant did, when he had found the true treasure, he hides it, and for joy
thereof ((...) subducit sese) he withdraws himself to consider well and try
whether it were true treasure indeed, before he sells all that he has to buy
the field where it was, Matthew. 13. 44. 3. Thou may (if thou will try)
certainly discern this, 1. Cor. 2. 12. The Spirit is given us to that end
that we may know the things that are given us of God. Some rules I will give
thee whereby thou may know whether the good things that are in thee be, the
fruits of grace indeed. 1. If they be done by the direction and warrant of the
Word, thus is Josias goodness commended by the Holy Ghost to be true goodness
indeed, it was according to that which was written in the Law of the Lord, as
we read, 2. Chron. 35. 26. 2. If thy intent in doing of them, be to please,
serve, and honor God, not to serve thy self or men. By this note, the Apostle
describes truth of grace, both in himself and in others. Of himself he
says, Gal. 1. 10. that he did not in his Ministry seek to please men, but
that he served God in his spirit in the Gospel of his Son, Romans 1. 9. And of
others he says, Romans 14. 6. that he that did either regard or not regard a
day, was not to be despised or judged an hypocrite, so long as he did that
which he did unto the Lord, and in a care to please and approve himself unto
him. 3. If thou do what thou do in love to him, because thou know how
much he is delighted with and honored by thy obedience. For the Apostle says,
Gal. 5. 6. that that is true faith, and such as will avail a man and stand him
in stead, that works by love, and causes him to do every good work that he
does out of love unto God. And our Savior by this argument comforts Peter, and
assures him that the fall that he had taken, was not unto perdition, because
(as he proves by appealing to his own Conscience, Ioh. 21. 15.) there was
still (notwithstanding he denied him with his mouth) in his heart an unfeigned
love unto him. 4. Ifthou do what thou do of faith, and the love thou
bear to him grow from thy assurance that he loves thee in Christ, and that
thou art his child, that he has forgiven thee all thy sins, this was the root
of Marios love, Luke 7. 47. she loved much, because (she knew) many sins
were forgiven her.

3. To exhort such as have received any grace, to take heed of going back.
This doctrine tends not to licentiousness (as Papists slander it) For 3.
1. We grant the best may fall, and cannot choose but fall, unless he take
great heed. 2. God will be as angry with their sins, and correct them as
sharply as others, God is very terrible in the assembly of his Saints, says
the Prophet, Psalm. 89. 7. as is evident in the example of his severity toward
David, 2. Sam. 13. 11. 12. Though they cannot fall to death, they may receive
such bruises and maimes, as they shall never clawe of (happily) while they live,
and loose the sense of Gods favor which they esteem more of then of all the
world, David professes, Psalm. 46. 7. that there was no joy in the world
comparable unto the joy that he found. Thy love is better then wine says the
Spouse, Cant. 1. 2. 3. If ever they recover (as they that ever had truth of
grace shall certain do, yet) they shall do it with more difficulty then any
other sinner, as we may see in the example of David, Psalm. 51. Observe
therefore and take heed of those things, whereby the good estate of thy soul
may be impaired. And those are two principally. 1. As it is with the state of
the body, withold food, and rest, and exercise from it, and the strongest
body will decay; so is it with the state of the soul, withold from it the
means of grace, and it will decay, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 19. 20. If Prophecyings be
despised, the spirit will be quenched: yea Pro. 29. 18. Where there is no
vision, the people will decay. Yea Heb. 3. 13. If we do not daily by all good
means exhort and stir up our selves we are in danger to be hardened. 2. As
it is with the body, by poisoning or wounding it, the life of it (if it be not
quite taken away) yet will be endangered, and the health and strength of it
impaired greatly: so it is with the soul, by sinning against conscience (which
is as poison and a stabbe given unto it) it is greatly impaired. See this in
David and Peter, after they had yielded once, to sin against their
conscience; they grew weaker and weaker, more and more ungracious. When David
had once yielded to his lust, then he cloakes it, and adds sin to sin in a
strange manner. Peter when he had denied once his Master, then he does it with
oaths and execrations, and strange impudency.

THE TWELFTH LECTVRE, ON APRIL, XXV. MDCIX.
IOH. IIII. XV. The Woman faith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I
thirst not, neither come hither to draw.


Our Savior having in the two former verses proved, that the Water of life
which he had to give, was far more excellent then the water of Jacobs Well,
this poor woman (though she had before objected and reasoned against it) is
now through the divine power that she felt in his word, convinced, and
believes that he had indeed a water to give that was better then that of
Jacobs Well, which he that has once drunk of, shall never thirst again. And
(out of this persuasion she had of the truth of that he had said) she did now
bear a reverent estimation to his person (whom at first she esteemed basely
of, as of an ordinary Jew) she desires this water that he had spoken of, and
says unto him. Sir, give me of that water, yet (still conceiving that this
thirst he had spoken of, was but the thirst of the body, and the Water of life
but a material water) she desires it only out of a carnal respect she had to
her own profit and ease, for so she says, Sir give me of that water that I
may not thirst, and come hither to draw. First, then in that this woman (being
yet a natural and wicked woman) believes now the word of Christ, likes it, and
was affected with it, and desires this water he had spoken of, and yet does all
this in a carnal respect to her profit and ease. We learn, That the
principal thing the natural man respects Doct.
in the affection he seems to bear unto the Word, is his carnal ease and
contentment; so far as religion is a friend to that, he likes and imbraceth
it: but when once it crosses him in that, he regards it not, but will be ready
to renounce it. Before he entertaineth any truth of God, he uses to enquire
first whether it will further or hinder his profit, be for or against his
advantage yea or no. What profit should we have if we pray unto him, say such
kind of men, Job 21. 15.

The truth of this Doctrine will appear in these three points.

1. Many things in Religion he likes, because they seem to make for his profit.

2. There is no truth that he receives, but he turns and applies it to his
worldly and carnal advantage.

3. There is no truth that he is so well persuaded of, but he will be ready to
renounce it when once it proves an occasion of loss and trouble to him in the
world.

1. A natural man, yea, a very wicked man may in many things consent unto the
truth of God, and both in profession and practice, show a liking and love to
religion; and that only for the carnal contentment, and benefit that he
finds in it. You shall find (John 6. 14, 15.) that a great multitude of the
Jews, about 5000 people, give a notable testimony of Christ, and show a
marvelous affection unto him. Of a truth this is the Prophet (say they) that
should come into the world: yea they would needs have made him a King. But our
Savior says of these with a vehement asseueration, that they did this only,
because they had eat of the loaves and were filled, verse 26. And the Lord
says of the wicked Israelites, Hos. 10. 11. E^hraim is as an H^yfer used to
delight in threshing (alluding to the manner of their threshing; the oxen that
trod out their corn, were at liberty to eat, and might not be musled, Deuteronomy.
25. 4.) that is, they took delight in such duties of religion, as did not
curb nor cross their nature, but yielded profit unto them. Ye shall have many
a mere natural man, yea many a very wicked man, that uses ordinarily to
pray, and will seldom miss a Sermon, yea sometime perform extraordinary
duties, yea and that not for the credit he hopes to receive thereby from men
(for those are the grosser sort of hypocrites, Matthew. 6. 5. but) even because
he is persuaded in his conscience, it will be profitable unto him in his
worldly estate, and that God will that way reward him for it. See a proof of
this, Esaias 58. 2. They seek me daily, and will know my ways even as a nation
that does righteously; yea they fasted, verse 3. and what moved them to do
this? Surely, their worldly profit and safety, they looked for and hoped to
merit thereby, as appears verse 3. Wherefore have we fasted, and thou see it
not. Some temporal judgment (it seems) befell them, which they hoped by
their forwardness in religious duties to have prevented, whereby God (as they
conceived) testified that he regarded not their services, and this did greatly
disquiet them.

But can any one be so simple, as to think the serving of God will advantage
him in the world? Object.


Yes surely; for 1. The natural man may know that the earth is the Lords; and
that God has made many great promises, even for this life, unto them that Answ.
serve him, godliness is profitable unto all things (says the Apostle, 1. Tim.
4 8) having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come, such
a promise is that, Psalm. 34. 9, 10. O fear the Lord ye his Saints, for there
is no ^ant to them that fear him: The young Lions do lack and suffer hunger;
but they that seek the Lord, shall not want any good thing. 2. He finds by his
own experience, that when he has served God (even after his fashion) he has
prospered the better: for such is the love the Lord bears to piety, as he
has been wont to reward with outward and temporal blessings; the very
outward duties of his service, when they have been performed, but even in a
natural devotion; without an upright and faithful heart. See a manifest
proof of this, Ps. 78. 34. They sought him. Ver. 37. Their heart was not
upright. Ver. 38. Yet he being merciful, forgave their iniquity, destroyed
them not, but oftentimes called back his anger. So it is said of Ieho^haz, 2.
King. 12. 14. He besought the Lord, and the Lord heard him, and yet ver. 2. he
was a most wicked man. While the Ark of God did but remain and rest in the
house of Obed-Edom three month, it is said, The Lord blessed the house of
Obed-Edom, and all that he had, 2. Chro 13. 14. Never did man entertain any
guest that will pay so well for his lodging, and so recompense the kindness he
receives, as religion will do God has ever been wont to bless the family
where the outward duties of his worship have been constantly performed and but
an outward conformity yielded unto them. 3. Yea, God has bin wont to bless
many a wicked man, for the piety of such as have belonged unto him, and to whom
he has given entertainment* though himself have not served God at all, Genesis
12. 2. Thou shall be a blessing (says God to Abraham) and expounds himself in
the next words, Verse 3. I will also bless them that bless thee. See an
experiment of it in Putiphar, Genesis 39. 5. The Lord blessed the Egyptians house
for Joseph's sake. Now this many a natural man observes well: and this makes
him both to serve God himself, and to like Religion in others. It is certain,
many a natural man likes his child and his servant the better, if they be
religious; and if they be not, he wishes that they were. But why does he so?
surely, he knows that he shall have the more profit by them, if they were so,
he knows they will be more diligent, and more dutiful, the more faithful
unto him, and that God will bless him the better. You shall see a plain
proof for this in Putiphar, Genesis 39. 4. He loved no servant so well as he did
Joseph, he trusted him more then any, and advanced him above all, but mark the
reason, Verse 3. His master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord
made all that he did, to prosper in his hand: I do not say that every natural
man is thus minded, for many have not that wit and policy in them, either they
see not that Religion brings such blessings to the place where it is
entertained, or they are so wicked and profane, that they will rather lose
these blessings, then they will be beholding to Religion for them. But yet this
is the disposition of many, they like Religion, because it is so commodious;
and were it not for this* God should have no service at all done to him by
them, there would not be so much as a show of Religion in them; so that of
these men it may be said, as Romans 16. 18. They that are such, serve not our
Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly.

And thus much for the first point.

2. The second point wherein I told you the truth of this Doctrine may appear,
is this; That there is no truth which the natural man receives, but he 2.
turns and applies to his carnal advantage; he reads and hears, only in
hope to find contentment to his flesh. The most holy and wholesome parts of Gods
truth, he understands carnally, and applies to the feeding of his own
humor, and contentment of his flesh. This is the only use tha^ they make of
all that they hear and read, that they may sin with more contentment and
quiet of mind. Even as the spider that gathers poison of every flower, Unto
them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure, but their minds and
consciences are defiled, Tit. 1. 15. Whenever they come to hear Gods Word,
they bring with them an Idol in their heart (some corruption or other) and
whatsoever they read or hear, they turn to the service of their own Idol,
Ezekiel. 14. 1, 3. These men have set up their Idol in their hearts, and put the
stumbling block of their iniquity before their face. Yea it is certain, that
many wicked men receive not that confirmation, that quiet and contentment to
their heart, in their sin, by any thing in the world, as they do by the
blessed and holy Word of God. Such there were in the Apostles days, Romans 3. 8.
who did affirm that the Apostles said, Let us do evil that good may come of
it. They wrest the Scriptures (says the Apostle, 2. Pet. 3. 16.) to their own
destruction. They turn the grace of our God into lasciviousness, says
another Apostle, Jude 4. Thus most men pervert these most comfortable Doctrines
that are taught in sundry places in the holy Scripture; as that in Mat. 24 24
that it is not possible for the elect to be deceived, or to perish. And that in
Romans 4. 5. To him that works not, but belieueth in him that justifies the
ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. And that Romans 6. 14. Ye are
not under the Law but under grace. And that 1. Ioh. 2. 1, 2. If any man sin,
we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the
propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of
the whole world. And that sentence wherewith we begin our Lyturgie (which,
though not in the same words, yet in sense and effect is delivered by the
Prophet, Ezekiel. 18. 21, 22.) At what time soever a sinner does repent him of his
sins from the bottom of his heart, I will put all his wickedness out of my
remembrance, says the Lord.

And this is also the cause, why they will hear and confer with, and move
questions to the best Preachers of the Word; because they are in hope to get
some what from them, that they may make to serve for their purpose; and if they
can, it will quiet and comfort them more, then the speeches or judgments of an
hundred other men. It is true indeed, they love the corruptest teachers best,
the good fellow Priest, Mic. 2. 11. If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood
do lie, saying, I will prophecy unto thee of wine, and of strong drink, he
shall even be the Prophet of this people. But yet they will not only hear
such, but the best also, in hope to hear from them somewhat that may serve
their turn. These are like Balaam, that when God had given him his answer,
Number. 22. 12. yet out of this hope he waited still for another answer, verse 19,
20. So Ahab, 1. King. 22. 16. had wont often to send for Michaia, and to charge
him to speak nothing but the truth, why so? It would have comforted him more
to have gotten somewhat from Michaia for his turn, then from all the four
hundred Prophets besides.

Thus you see then this second point confirmed, which I observed to you
concerning the affection that a natural man bears unto the Word. Now as this
is a fearful sin, so two things are to be observed concerning the dangerous
estate of these men.

1. That in all the places where the Scripture speaks of them, there the Holy
Ghost sets a black mark upon them, and speaks of them as of Reprobates; the
Apostle Paul speaking of such as perverted the Word and Doctrine that he
taught, whose damnation is past, says he, Romans 3. 8. And Peter speaking of
them that wrested the Scriptures, says, 2. Pet. 3. 16. that they did it to
their own destruction. And Jude says of them that turned the grace of God
(the doctrine of Salvation by Gods free grace only) into lasciviousness, that
they were of old ordained unto this condemnation, Jude 4.

2. That the Lord has threatened to feed these men in their humor, so as, such
men do never lightly read, or hear, but somewhat they find that may serve their
turn. To Ahab that was unwilling to be faithfully taught, and acquainted with
the will of God, but willing to be flattered and deceived, God sent a lying
spirit with efficacy of terror, Thou shall persuade him, says the Lord, 1.
King. 22. 22. And prevail also: go forth and do so. And of every one that
having set up his Idol in his heart, came unto the Prophet, the Lord says,
Ezekiel. 14. 4. That he himself would answer that man according to the multitude
of his idols.

3. The third point. The natural man will be ready to forsake and renounce any
truth that he has seeme^ to have been best grounded in, and to have received
with greatest comfort, when once it becomes an occasion of loss or trouble to
him in the world: while peace and prosperity lasts, he may seem to like the
Gospel, and every truth of it, as well as any man: but if he cannot profess
it without interrupting his peace, he is ready to renounce it. See the proof
of this in the hearer of the Word that is resembled to the stony ground, Mat.
13. 20. 21. He hears the word, and anon with joy receives it; but when
tribulation or persecution arises, because of the word, by and by he is
offended. And in that rich man that had seemed for a time full of zeal and
devotion toward Christ, Mar. 10. 17. 22. Of these the Apostle says, that
because they are enemies to the Cross of Christ, and mind earthly things,
therefore their belly is their God, and their end damnation, Philip. 3. 18, 19.

1. To teach us how to judge of others that make profession of Religion, and
show love to the Word. Praise God when thou see any (how lewd Use 1.
soever they have been) to do so; and hope the best; and fret not, nor like
worse of our assemblies and Religion for this, as the Pharisees did of Christ,
because the Publicans resorted to him, Luke 15. 2. But yet build not too much
upon this, as if that therefore they must needs be soundly religious; nor be
offended with Religion, because thou hear and see many of these to fall
away; for they may have gone thus far, upon mere carnal respects, and be
very hypocrites.

2. To teach us how to judge of our own profession, and liking to the Word
whether it be carnal or spiritual. It is necessary every one of us 2.
should examine this. Take heed (says our Savior to them that showed such
zeal in hearing of him, Luke 12. 1.) of hypocrisy. And Luke 8. 18. Take heed
how ye hear. We should in this case ask our own soul, as Christ does Andrew,
and the other Disciple, Ioh. 1. 38. What seek you? Labor to approve thy heart
to God in that profession thou make; for what have we gained by all our
hearing and profession, if we be still hypocrites? Romans 8. 8. They that are in
the flesh cannot please God.

I will therefore give you four notes, whereby you may approve your hearts to be
upright in the profession of the truth.

1. If thou can be willing to hear, and receive (without difference) every
truth of God, though it cross thee in thy disposition and delights never so
much. True it is, 1. A man is not bound to receive any thing in Religion, upon
the credit of any man whatsoever, till he have tried and examined it by the
Scriptures. They that heard the Apostles themselves, were not bound to do so,
Act. 17. 11. Now we are expressly forbidden to do so; Prove all things, says
the Apostle, 1. These. 5. 21. And when, or upon what occasion says he so?
Surely, immediately upon the Charge he had given in the former Verse, against
despising of prophesying. And therein he teaches us plainly, 1. That we must
prove and examine whatsoever we hear in Prophecyings and Sermons, whosoever
the Preacher be. 2. That this is no despising of prophesying, nor contempt done
to the Ministers of the Word, to examine the doctrine that they teach by the
Word of God.

2. A man may be more desirous to hear some truths and doctrines taught and
delivered, then some others, because some are of more use to him then others
are: As the Minister may and ought to teach some truths, and to insist upon
them, with more diligence and zeal then others. This is a faithful saying
(says the Apostle, Tit. 3. 8.) and these things I will that thou affirm
constantly. So may every Christian hear some truths with more desire and
affection then others, Tit. 3. 8.

3 Some truths may be (in Christian wisdom) for a time concealed, because the
audience is not fit to hear them: We have our Saviors own example for this
point of wisdom, Mar. 4. 33. He spoke the Word unto them as they were able to
hear it. Yet he that has a good heart, will be willing to hear and receive
one truth as well as another, and when he sees it to be Gods truth, will
(without reasoning) receive it, and yield unto it; and not prescribe, what
shall be spoken to him in the Lords name, as they did, Esa. 30. 10. But comes
to the hearing of the Word with Cornelius resolution, Acts 10. 33. We are
prepared before the Lord to hear all, things whatsoever that are commanded
thee of God. His soul says to God as Samuel was taught to say, 1 Samuel 3. 9.
Speak Lord, for thy servant hears. He is willing to be acquainted with every
part of Gods will; though it make never so much against him. A notable example
we have of this in old Ely; for though he had just cause to judge, that that
which Samuel had to say to him from the Lord, would be little to his comfort;
Both because of a heavy message he had received from the Lord a little before,
1 Samuel 2. 27. to 36. And because he saw Samuel was very unwilling to let him
know what the Lord had said unto him, 1 Samuel 3. 15. Yet see how earnest he is
with Samuel to know all, God do so to thee and more also (says he, 1 Samuel 3.
17.) if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that the Lord said unto
thee. And surely this should be the desire of all Gods people to their
Ministers, that they would deal faithfully with them, and acquaint them with
the whole counsel of God.

For, 1. All the holy Scripture is of equal authority, and therefore if we
receive any one part for his sake that is the Author of it, we will receive
all, 2 Timothy 3. 16. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God. And Iam. 2.
11. He that said, do not commit adultery, said also, do not kill.

2 The Minister of God is bound to deliver the whole will of God to his people,
There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before
all the congregation of Israel, Josh. 8. 35. And Joshua in that case was no
further bound then, than every Minister of the Gospel is now. Go stand and
speak in the Temple to the people (says the Angel of the Lord to Peter and
John, Act. 5. 20.) all the words of this life. And it was Paul's comfort, as he
professes, Act. 20. 27. That he had studied to declare (unto the Church of
Ephesus) all the counsel of God.

3 God has charged the people to hear all, Observe and hear all these words
that I command thee, says the Lord, Deuteronomy. 12. 28. And, Him shall ye hear in
all things whatsoever he shall say unto you, says the Lord concerning Christ,
Acts 3. 22.

4 Every truth of God revealed in his Word, concerns every one of Gods people,
and is profitable for them to know: Those things that are revealed (says
Moses, Deuteronomy. 29. 29.) belong to us and to our children for ever, that we may do
all the words of this Law. And the Apostle teaches us, 2 Timothy (...). 16. that
All Scripture is profitable. And Romans 15. 4. that Whatsoever things were
written aforetime (even in the Old Testament) were written for our learning.
Insomuch as the Minister shall do them great wrong, and make himself guilty of
their blood, if he conceal any part of Gods truth from them, Act. 20. 26.

2 If thou respect not in thy profession any worldly profit, benefit, or
contentment, but only the kingdom of heaven, and the salvation of thy soul.
True godliness has the promises even of this life, 1 Timothy 4. 8. and we may be
sure not to want any thing that shall be good for us, if we truly fear God,
Psalm 34. 10. But that is not the chief thing we should have respect unto, nor
the mark we must aim at, nor the profit and reward we must seek for, in
serving God: but the kingdom of heaven: Seek ye first the kingdom of God,
says our Savior, Mat. 6. 33. Our conversation is in heaven, it is heaven that
we trade for, says the Apostle, Phil. 3. 20. and 1 Cor. 9. 25. We run and
strive (iaith he) to obtain an incorruptible crown. And he tells the
Thessalonians' 2 These. 1. 5. that all the sufferings he did endure, were for
the kingdom of God, that they might not miss of that.

3 When our care is to make use of all that we hear and learn, for the
edifying of our selves in faith, and a good conscience; not to feed any humor
of our corrupt nature, or that we may be able to talk well: but that we may
practice that we hear, Desire the sincere milk of the word (says the
Apostle, (...) Pet. 2. 2.) that ye may grow thereby. That is the only right
use that should be made of the Word, to be edified in our faith, as the Apostle
teaches us, 1 Timothy 1. 4. Thy word have I hid in my heart (says David, Psalm.
119. 11.) that I might not sin against thee. In which respect also the whole
truth of God revealed in his Word is called 1 Timothy 6. 3. The doctrine which is
according unto godliness, it tends wholly unto this, to make men godly. And
they that use it to any other end, pervert it dangerously unto their own
destruction.

4 When thou so receiuest the love of the truth, that thou can resolve to
suffer any thing, rather than thou will renounce or fall from any part of Gods
truth, that thou know, and art persuaded of. True it is, 1. A man may have a
good heart, and yet use wisdom in shunning persecution and disgrace. 2. The
Lord in his goodness tendereth the weakness of some of his servants so far,
as that he never brings them to any trouble for his sake. But every one that
has a good heart, resolves with himself, and is willing, to suffer any
disgrace and loss for the truths sake, if God shall see good to call him to
it. Yea, we must all be willing, to contend earnestly for the maintenance of
the faith, Jude 4. And without this willingness to suffer none can be saved:
If any man will come after me, and enjoy heaven, where I am to be, (says our
Savior, Luke 9. 23.) Let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and
follow me. And Luke 14. 26, 27. Whosoever does not bear his cross, and come
after me, cannot be my Disciple.

THE THIRTEENTH. LECTVRE ON MAY II. MDCIX.
JOHN IIII. XVI, XVII, XVIII. Jesus says unto her, Go, call thy husband, and
come hither.

The Woman answered, and said, I have no husband, Jesus said unto her, thou
have well said, I have no husband.

For, thou have had five husbands, and he whom thou now have, is not thy
husband: in that saidest thou truly.


WE heard the last day (out of the former Verse) that this Woman though now she
began to conceive better, both of the person and speech of Christ than she had
done before, and did not only give credit to that which Christ had said
touching the water of life, but was also so affected with his speech, as she
did desire him to give her of that water, yet did she not understand his
meaning, but thought still that Water of life he spoke of, had been no other
than a material water, and therefore desired it only in a carnal respect she
had to her ease and profit. Two causes there were of this her blockishnesse.
First, That she knew Christ no better; but took him to be an ordinary man. The
other, that she knew her self and her own estate no better; but lived
securely in known and heinous sin. Our Savior for all this gives her not
quite over, because of her blockishnesse and vncapablenesse, but now (leaving
the speech of the water of life) he begins to make himself, and her own
estate better known unto her. To this purpose he discouers to her the most
secret things that ever she did; especially such as might stir up in her a
thirst after the water of life. For, it appears by her own words to her
neighbors, Verse 29, 39. That he had told her many other things, that were
unknown to all men. But the Evangelist mentions this only, of all the secrets
that he told her, because in this the infinite mercy of Christ did most shine,
that had such respect unto, and was so careful of the salvation of so vile a
woman. Now he does not charge her with her sin in plain terms, nor deal
roughly with her, he calls her not Whore, nor tells her at the first, that she
lived in filthy adultery (for he knew in his divine wisdom, that this
sharpness would not be needful, but hurtful rather) but first bids her go
and call her husband, and come again. And though he knew it well she had no
husband, yet did he think it fit, to draw out so much from her own mouth,
which when she had confessed, then did he plainly discover how privy he was to
the whole course of her life, and tells her (for the further aggravating of her
sin) that though she had had five Husbands, yet she kept one now that was not
her Husband.

So that, these words afford four principal things to our consideration.

1. That our Savior thirsting after the Salvation of this poor Woman,
discovers to her her sin, and that nothing he had said before, could work
upon her conscience, till he took this course with her.

2. That the sin he did discover unto her, was a secret sin unknown to all
men.

3. That of all the sins she was guilty of, when he would touch and awaken
her conscience, he makes choice of this sin of Fornication, and charge her
with that.

4. That notwithstanding she lived in so heinous a sin, yet he reiects her
not, nor deals roughly with her, but he deals most tenderly with her, and
shows much care and desire of her salvation.

First then, in that our Savior seeking the salvation of this Woman, that he
might make her more capable of that he had said concerning the water of life,
and work in her a true desire of it, tells her of the heinous sin she lived
in. We learn,

That they that would win souls to God, must plainly and particularly Doct. 1.
discover to men their sins.

Before I confirm this doctrine, two cautions and rules are to be observed
from this example, for the better understanding of it. 1. A Minister is not
always bound in plain terms, imperiously, sharply, and bitterly to reprove
the sins he knows by his hearers; but he is bound to take that course which
he sees to be most likely to prevail and do them good. For our Savior here
calls not this woman whore, nor at the first directly tells her of her sin
(that might happily have driven her from him) but goes about her, and uses a
holy cra^t and cunning with her. So speaks the Apostle of himself, 2. Cor.
12. 16. For as much as I was crafty, I took you with guile. Thus dealt Nathan
with David, 2. Sam. 12. 1. 4. He uses a Parable and long circumlocution to
make way into his heart for his reproof. He that wins souls is wise (says
Solomon) Proverbs 11. 30. And Proverbs 15. 2. The tongue of the wise uses
knowledge aright. To the application of the Word, a special Wisdom is
required, 1. Corinthians. 12. 8. The Pastors gift (whose work stands principally
in application) is called there, the word or utterance of wisdom.

2. Sin must so be reproved, as that the credit and estimation of the person
that sins may be preserved as much as may be. Private sins must not be
made public. Our Savior therefore here when he discouers to this Woman her
secret sin, does it in secret, between them two, he would not have so much
as any of his Disciples by. This our Savior gives for a rule to be observed by
all that desire to win their brother, Mat. 18. 15. Go and tell him his fault
between him and thoe alone. Yet nevertheless, this must be done by all that
would win souls to God, they must plainly and particularly discover to them
their sins. Let them do it with as much wisdom as they can, and with as much
love as they can, so they do it. This must needs be done.

This is made a chief part of the office and duty of a Minister, when the
Apostle had deeply charged Timothy, 2, Tim. 4. 12. to preach the word, and to
be instant in season and out of season, he tells him how he should perform
that duty to do it well, reprove (says he, yea) rebuke, exhort, etc. and the
contrary noted as the most proper mark of a false Prophet, Lam. 2. 14. Thy
Prophets have looked out vain and foolish things for thee, they have not
discovered thine iniquity. Yea, this must be done, 1. Particularly and plainly,
that the party may feel himself and his own sin touched: as plainly
appears by the Prophet Nathans dealing with David, 2. Sam. 12. 12. Thou art
the man; yea, 2. If they be public and scandalous sins, they must be reproved
publicly, 1. Tim. 5. 20. 3. It must be done effectually and zealously. Cry
aloud (says the Lord, Esa 58. 1, 2.) lift up thy voice like a trumpet. Yea, 4.
In some cases with sharpness and bitterness also, Tit. 1. 13. Rebuke them
sharply. This sharpness Christ himself used sometimes, Mat. 23. 33. Ye
serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?

The Reason of this is, the benefit that comes to Gods people, by having their
sins thus plainly and effectually discovered unto them. Reason.


1. Till men have the true sense and knowledge of sin, they can never
understand rightly, or clearly believe any thing in Religion with any
certainty or assurance. This we have an experiment of in this poor woman, how
blockish was she, till Christ revealed unto her her sin: and one chief reason
why she was so unable to understand the Word of Christ, was, because she lived
securely in a grievous sin. As the earth cannot receive the seed till it be
plowed up, so the heart of man cannot receive the Word, till the Lords plow
have been in it. This comparison the Holy Ghost uses, Ier. 44.

A kind of knowledge in Religion, I grant is in many that live securely in
grievous sins, and never had their consciences touched with an effectual
knowledge and sense of sin; but you never knew any such that did attain to a
clear and certain knowledge. The Lord will teach sinners (says David, Psalm.
25. 8. that is, such as know and feel themselves to be most miserable and
grievous sinners) in the way, and verse. 9. The meek (such he means as are made
meek this way, such as through poverty of spirit and mourning for that, are
made meek and humble, according to that gradation our Savior uses, Mat. 5.
3, 4, 5.) will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way. And
of the rest the Apostle Paul says, that such as have pleasure in unholiness
and unrighteousness, cannot receive the love of the truth, no nor believe the
truth, but shall be apt to believe lies, and to be seduced, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 10, 12.

2. Till men have the true knowledge and sense of sin, they can never know
Christ to the comfort and salvation of their own souls. Of this also we have
an experiment in this poor Woman of Samaria. She never knew the gift of God,
nor who it was that spoke unto her, she knew not Christ aright, nor esteemed of
him, till he had discovered to her her sin. Such only are fit to come to
Christ, Matthew. 11. 28. Such and such only shall be refreshed by him as are
weary and heavy laden this way. And indeed that no man can come to true
comfort, till he have the true knowledge and sense of his sin, is evident by
this, that no man can find mercy with God for the pardon of his sin, till he
can with a penitent and humbled heart confess his sin unto God, Proverb. 28.
13. He that covers his sins shall not prosper, but he that confesses and
forsakes them, shall find mercy. And therefore David uses this as a reason to
move God to mercy, Psalm 51. 3. For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my
sin is ever before me.

Many think that the Ministry that plainly and powerfully rebukes sin,
serves to no other use, then to bring men to despair, and to fill them with
melancholy; but this is a fond conceit. The true knowledge and sense of sin,
is the only way to comfort, John 16. 7, 8. Christ says, the Spirit the
Comforter which he would send, should reprove and convince the world. The
Spirit of God never comforted any till he had first reproved and convinced
them. Therefore Paul rejoiced greatly to hear of the Corinthians sorrow, 2.
Cor. 7. 7. and tells them, ver. 8. That he repented him not that he had made
them sorrowful, and says ver. 9. That he had done them no hurt at all in
reproving them so sharply, and bringing them to such heaviness, and gives this
for the reason of it, ver. 10. Godly sorrow causes repentance never to be
repented of, but worldly sorrow causes death. And the Apostle James when he
had exhorted them to humiliation for sin, and said Iam. 4. 9. Be afflicted, and
mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy into
heaviness. He preuents this objection, and tells them, ver. 10. if you be once
thus humbled, then he will lift you up: as if he should say, that is the way to
sound comfort; according to that promise he had spoken of, ver. 6. God
resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.

3. Till men have the true knowledge and sense of sin, their hearts can never
be subdued to the obedience of God, nor come to a true reverence and fear of
God. This also may be seen in this poor woman; till Christ told her of her
sin, she answered him scornfully, and rejected him, and objected, and reasoned
against him. What was it in the Ministry of Peter that wrought that wonderful
conversion, when about three thousand souls received the word gladly, and were
baptized, and added to the Church, Act. 2. 41. even such as had before mocked
and scorned the Apostles, ver. 13. Surely it was this plain and effectual
discovery of their sin, God has made (says he to them, ver. 36.) that same
Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard this
(says the holy story, ver. 37.) they were pricked in their heart. What was
that in the Ministry of the Prophets that wrought such a change in the man that
was before ignorant and an Infidel, of whom we read, 1. Corinthians. 14. 23.
Surely it was this plain and effectual discovery of his sin unto him, he
was convinced of all (says the Apostle, ver. 24 25.) he was judged of all. All
the Preachers that he heard (as if they had conspired together) did discover to
him his sin and damnable estate, and even convinced his conscience of it. And
then were the secrets of his heart made manifest, and so falling down on his
face, he worshipped God, and reported that God was in them of a truth. The man
that knows sin aright, and the burden and danger of it; will be desirous to
know what he may do to please God; he will be obedient and tractable, ready to
do any thing that God shall require of him: and till then men will hear what
they list, and do what they list. See this in the fruit of John Baptists
Ministry, when he (in the spirit and power of Eliah) had sharply reproved his
hearers, and denounced Gods vengeance against them, and so humbled them deeply
with sense of sin, and fear of Gods wrath, then even the Publicans and
soldiers also (as we read Luke 3. 12, 14.) came to him and said, Master, what
shall we do? And in Saul, Act. 9, 6. When he trembled and was astonished by
this means, then he was ready to say, Lord, What will thou have me to do?

If any man shall object and say, what need Preachers trouble themselves with
this; seeing there is no man so simple, but he knows himself to be a sinner;
Object.
yea his own conscience will tell him that, it will tell him that these and
these things that himself has done are sins, as well as the Preacher can
tell him?

I answer, yes, sometimes it will do so indeed. But yet this is the ordinary
means to bring a man to an effectual knowledge of his sin. Answ.
This Woman was not so simple, but she knew that she lived in adultery, and
that that was a sin; but she came not to remorse and repentance till Christ
had told her. So also was David brought to a saving knowledge of his sin,
even by Nathans plain and effectual reproving of him, 2. Sam. 12. 12, 13.
True it is, the conscience of every man will (when God shall awaken it) tell a
man of his sins plainly and roundly, severely and sharply, as we may see,
Romans 2. 15, 16. But it lies a sleep for a time, and will either say nothing,
or flatter a man, and is therefore compared to a Band-dogge that lies at the
door, Genesis 4. 7. The Ministry of the Word is the effectual and mighty or
dinance of God, to awaken the conscience, Romans 3. 20. By the Law comes the
knowledge of sin. The use of this Doctrine is first for the Minister. Use. 1.


1. To exhort him not to neglect this part of his Ministry, by the
consideration: 1. Of the great charge that is laid upon him, and the danger he
is in, if he neglect it: Think seriously of these two places, If thou do st
not speak to warn the wicked from his way (says the Lord, Ezekiel. 33. 8.) that
wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine
hand. And Ier. 1. 17. Speak unto them all that I command thee, be not dismayed
at their faces, least I confound thee before them. 2. Of the small cause he
has to despair of good success in it, if he perform it with a good heart.
How forcible are right words, Job 6. 25. See an example of this in 2. King. 5.
13, 14. what success the admonition and reproof even of a servant, had
(through the blessing of God) with a great Lord that was but a heathen man. 3.
Of the recompense and supply God will make of any friends he shall lose
thereby, There is no man that has left (willingly lost) house, or brethren, or
sisters, or father (says our Savior, Mar. 10. 29, 30.) or mother, or wife, or
children, or lands, for my sake and the Gospels; but he shall receive a hundred
fold now in this time: houses and brethren, etc. and in the world to come
eternal life. 4. Of the reverence and estimation that is gained by it usually,
even in the hearts of such, as at first most distasted it, Pro. 28. 23. He that
rebukes a man, afterward shall find more favor, then he that flattereth with
the tongue.

2. To exhort him, that since he must be a reproouer of sin in his people, he 2.
use all means, and carry himself toward them, so as his reproves may
prevail with them. And those are chiefly two. 1. He must so carry himself
toward them in his whole course, that it may appear he loves them
unfeignedly. See the force of this in the Apostles speech, Romans 15. 14. I am
persuaded of you my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness (that is, of
kindness and readiness to do good to them you live with) filled with all
knowledge, able to admonish one another. Teaching us that no man is so fit to
admonish another, as he that is both full of knowledge, and able thereby to
convince him; and also full of goodness, and one of whom the party may be
persuaded that he bears a kind and loving affection toward him. 2. He must so
live, as by his unblameable and holy conversation, he may gain authority in
their hearts. See how this will prevail, It is said of Herod, Mar. 6. 20. that
he feared John the Baptist, and observed him, and when he heard him, he did
many things, and heard him gladly. And the reason that moved him so to do, is
said to be this, because he knew him to be a just and an holy man. And for this
cause the Apostle gives that charge unto Timothy, 1. Tim. 4. 12. Let no man
despise thy youth, but be thou an example of the belieuers in word, in
conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity: as if he should say,
if thou be such a one, they will never despise thee, no not when thou shall
command and teach, when thou shall teach and reprove them with boldness and
authority, though thou be so young a man.

The second use of the Doctrine is for all Gods people. 1. To admit and accept
of this part of Gods ordinance, even of the word of reproof, as well as of
instruction or comfort, receive with meeknes the ingrafted word which is able
to save your souls, (Iam. 1. 21.) that is, every part of Gods Word, which will
quite change your nature and disposition, when you have once rightly received
it. Count it not pride in the Minister to reprove the sin of any that lives
under his charge. For, 1. He has authority to do it, he is set over them in
the Lord, 1. These. 5. 12. and therefore has authority to admonish them. He
speaks to them in Gods name, and by commission from him. And who may think
himself too good to receive a reproof from the Lord? Hear ye and give ear
(says the Prophet, Ier. 13. 15.) Be not proud, for the Lord has spoken. The
faithful Minister unto his hearers in Christ's stead, 2. Cor. 5. 20. 2. The
faithful Minister takes no pride in it, but performs it unwillingly: see how
Gods holy Prophets have bewailed their own condition, by reason of this task
that God has laid upon them. Woe is me my mother (says Jeremy, Ier. 15. 10.)
that thou have borne me a man of strife, and a man of contention to the whole
earth. 2. Desire to be acquainted with thy sins, and pray as David, Psalm. 141.
5. Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness, let him reprove me, it
shall be an excellent oil that shall not break my head. And as Job, Job 13.
23. Make me to know my transgressions and sins.

Lecture the foureteenth, May 30. 1609.
IT follows, that we proceed to the second of those four points, we observed
in these words. The sin he discouers to her, was a secret sin, unknown to
all men. For though it were well enough known to her self, both that she
lived in fornication, and that fornication was a sin, yet may it well
appear, that she had the reputation of an honest woman, among her neighbors,
and consequently, that her sin was unknown to them. For, 1. Upon her motion,
they came forth unto him, as unto the Messiah, verse. 30. 2. Yea, many of them
believed in him, for the report that this woman gave of him, verse. 39. and from
hence we learn,

That the Lord is privy to all the sins of men, and able to lay them open, and
Doct. 2.
charge them with them, how secretly soever they have been committed. Who
knows not this, may you say unto me? Or what needs any proof of a thing that
is so plain and evident? Surely there is no man will seem to make doubt of
this, and yet it appears evidently by the lives of men, that there be very few
that believe it indeed. But there is this secret Atheism lurking in the hearts
of all, more or less, that they either fancy to themselves such a god, as the
Epicure did, that sits idle in the heavens, and knows not, or regards not what
is done here below; or at least are not fully persuaded of this, or never think
seriously of it, that God sees and hears them. The Prophets make this secret
Atheism the root of all other sins that men commit, neither were they Heathen
and Infidels whom they thus charged, but such as lived in the Church of God,
Psalm. 10. 11. He has said in his heart, God has forgotten, he hides his
face, he will never see it: Ezekiel. 9. 9. The land is full of blood, and the City
full of perverseness, for they say, the Lord has forsaken the earth, and the
Lord sees not. We have all of us therefore need to be confirmed in this truth
by the Word of God, whereby faith only is wrought in the hearts of men.
Observe therefore the proof of this Doctrine in six points.

1. There is never a one of us, but the Lord knows us perfectly, what we are,
and what we have been, There is not any creature (says the Apostle, Heb. 4.
13.) that is not manifest in his sight, but all things are naked and opened to
the eyes of him with whom we have to do. There is nothing that ever any of us
did, but the Lord is privy to it, Psalm. 119. 168. For all my ways are before
thee.

2. We never uttered any word, but the Lord is privy to it, 2. King. 6. 12. The
Prophet could tell what the King of Aram spoke in his privy chamber. Ps. ^39.
4. There is not a word in my tongue, but lo thou know it wholly O Lord.

3. We never had evil thought in our heart, but the Lord is privy to it, Job
42. 4. I know (says Job) thou can do all things, and that there is no
thought hid from thee.

4. Yea, such of our actions, and words, and thoughts, as have been most
secret, most closely, and cunningly carried, those are not hid from him, but
those chiefly, he has an eye unto. The Lord is therefore called often by Christ,
Our Father which sees in secret, Mat. 6. 4. 6. 18. Psalm. 90. 8. Thou have set
our iniquities before thee, and our secret sins in the light of thy
countenance (says Moses) When Elihu had said, Job 34. 21. His eyes are upon
the ways of man, and he sees all his goings, he adds verse. 22. there is no
darkness nor shadow of death, that the workers of iniquity may be hid therein.

5. He does not carelessly cast his eyes upon that we do, but observes and
marks diligently the things we do, yea, he ponders and considers whence it
proceeds, and whereunto it tends: Psalm 11 4. The Lords Throne is in heaven,
his eyes will consider, his eyelids will try the children of men. Proverb. 5.
21. The ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his
paths. Therefore Proverbs 24. 12. the Lord is called, He that pondereth the
hearts. The Prophet could tell Gehezi, not only what he had gotten of Naaman,
but also to what use he meant to employ it, 2. Kings 5. 26. Went not mine heart
with thee when the man turned again from his Chariot to meet thee? Is this a
time to take money, and to receive garments, and olives, and vineyards, and
sheep, and oxen, and men-seruants, and maid-seruants? Had Gehezi received
olives, etc? No, but Elisha in the Spirit, set his heart upon that Gehezi did,
and considered his intent was to raise and make himself great by that money he
got so.

6. He so observes us, and all our ways, as he can never forget them.
Therefore he is said, to write them in a book. Esa. 65. 6. Behold, it is
written before me, and I will render and recompense it into their bosom. And
(as men do their chief evidences, which they are most careful to keep) he is
said to lay up these records in store with him, and to keep them, sealed up
amongst his treasures, Deuteronomy. 32. 34.

The reason why this must needs be so, the Lord must needs be privy to all the
sins, even the most secret sins of men, are two. Reason.


1. Because he is present every where. This reason is given, Ier. 23. 24. When
he had said in the beginning of the Verse, Can any one hide himself in 1.
the secret places that I shall not see him? he adds, do not I fill heaven and
earth, says the Lord. Psalm. 139 7. Whither shall I go from thy Spirit, or
whither shall I fly from thy presence? Acts 17. 27. Doubtless he is not far
from every one of us: for, in him we live, and move, and have our being.

2. Because he is the Judge of the whole World, and is to judge every man
righteously, according to his works: God shall bring every work into 2.
judgment (says the Holy Ghost, Eccl. 12. 14.) with every secret thing
whether it be good, or whether it be evil. For though he shall not want
witnesses at that day, yet it is necessary himself should have perfect
knowledge of all the actions of men, Esa. 11. 3. He shall not reprove after the
hearing of the ears. Therefore David Psalm. 94. confuting the Atheism of the
wicked that said, verse 9. The Lord shall not see, uses (among other) this
argument to convince them, ver. 10. He that chastises the Nations, shall not
be correct; be that teaches man knowledge, shall not he know?

The use of this Doctrine is double. 1. This Doctrine (if the Lord will be Use.
pleased to persuade our hearts to believe it) is most effectual, both to move
our hearts to speedy repentance for sins past, and to restrain us from sin
in time to come. The thing that most emboldeneth to sin, is the hope of
secrecy, as we may see, Genesis 39. 11. It is said of Joseph's Mistress, that he
coming into the house, when there was no body within but they two, verse 12.
Therefore she caught him by the garment, etc. True it is, that there be many
that are grown to that impudency, that they dare speak or do any thing
whosoever be by. They declare their sins as Sodom, Esaias 3. 9. Such a one was
Absolon, 2. Sam. 16. 22. He went in to his fathers Concubines in the sight of
all Israel. Such a one was the unjust Judge, Luke 18. 2. who neither feared
God, nor regarded man. Yea, that will the rather, swear and speak filthily,
when such are by, as they know they may grieve by it; as counting it a
disgrace, to be restrained by the presence and reverence of any man: but these
are far gone, these sin supernaturally; these are in a fit of frenzy and
madness, company and mirth has made them madd, and desperate, as indeed it
will do, Eccles. 2. 2. For naturally, and for the most part, the knowledge of
men will 1. Restrain them from sinning; and 2. Will work shame and trouble of
mind in them, when they have sinned. There are many sins that men would never
commit, but that they hope, to keep them secret: the presence of a godly man
would restrain them; yea, the presence of a little child would restrain
them. Darkness and hope of secrecy, is the principal encourager of men unto
most sins; they cannot sin securely, unless they may sin in secret. And
in this respect (amongst others) all sins are called the works of
darkness, Ephesians. 5. 11. Therefore Job speaking of sundry kinds of sinners,
says, Job 24. 13. These are they that abhor the light, verse 15. The eye of
the adulterer waits for the twilight, and says, none eye shall see me, and
disguiseth his face, and verse 17. If one know them, they are in the terrors
of death. Now, if the knowledge and priuitie that men have of our sins be of
such force: how much more would the knowledge the Lord has of them do it, if
men were fully persuaded of it. For, 1. A man may often sin so secretly, that
no man shall know of it; but he has the Lords eye upon him at all times;
though no man sees him, God sees him: Yea, he knows all our ways,
perfectly observes them, and takes notice of them, so as he can never forget
them. 2. No man can possibly dislike, or abhor us so much for any sin, as
the Lord does: Job 10. 4. Have thou carnal eyes, or do thou see as man
sees? Hab. 1. 12. Thou art of pure eyes, and can not see evil, thou can
not behold wickedness. 3. The more cunning any shall use in concealing his
sin, and keeping it secret, the more the Lord abhorrs him for it. Thus is
Achans sin aggrauated. Joshua 7. 11. They have even taken of the accursed
thing, and have also stolen and dissembled also. And so is the sin of Israel,
2. King. 17. 9. The children of Israel did secretly those things that were not
right against the Lord their God. 4 As he sees and disliketh all our sins, so
he certainly will one day charge us with them, either in this life to our
salvation, (as to this woman here) by the ministry of his word, as he did that
poor man that was before ignorant and unbelieving, 1. Cor. 14. 24, 25. which
is indeed the natural property of the word to do, it is a discerner (and
discouerer) of the thoughts and intents of the heart, as the Apostle speaks,
Heb. (...). 12. or in the life to come to our confusion, as he threatens
wicked men that he will do, at one time or other I will reprove thee, and set
thy sins in order before thine eyes says the Lord, Psalm. 51. ^1. and Eccl. 11,
9. Know thou that for all these things God will bring thee to judgment. 5. He
will also bring the secretest sins of men to light one day, and lay them open
even to men, Pro 10. 9 He that peruerteth his way shall be known, 1. Tim. 5.
25. They that are otherwise cannot be hid. He does often in this life discover
Hypocrites (by giving them up to the committing of open sins) Psalm. 125 5. Such
as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord will lead them forth with
the workers of iniquity. But this shall chiefly be done in the great day of the
Lord, then will the Lord lighten all things that are now hid in darkness, and
make the counsels of the hearts manifest, 1. Cor. 4. 5. This is the reason
our Savior uses, to dissuade men from hypocrisy, Luke 12. 1, (...). For
there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed, neither hid, that shall
not be known. The conclusion then of this first Use is, that we would not
flatter our selves in the secrecy of our sins, but seek the pardon of them,
and pray with the Prophet, Psalm. 19. 12. Cleanse thou me from secret faults.
Seek to have them blotted out of the Lords Book of remembrance, that he may
never charge us with them. And the way to obtain that, is now in the time of
grace, to lay them open before the Lord, and to charge our selves seriously
with them, with penitent and humbled hearts, Pro. 28. 13. He that confesses
and for saketh his sins, shall find mercy. For as he to whom sin is
forgiven, shall be sure to have his sin covered and hidden with the Lord:
Psalm 32. 1. So he that by remission and repentance has them not blotted out,
shall be sure to have them laid open, and brought to light: and though they
were committed in secret corners, they shall be published on the house top.

The second Use of this Doctrine is to exhort us to nourish in our hearts
continually, the persuasion of the Lords presence, and priuitie to all our 2.
ways, to walk with him continually. It is that that God required of Abraham,
Genesis 17. 1. and that is spoken to the praise of Enoch, Genesis 5 22. Enoch walked
with God.

For, 1. This is the best means to purge the heart from hypocrisy, and make
it upright, Walk before me, and be thou perfect says the Lord, Genesis 17. 1.
And therefore uprightness of heart is thus described. It is said of David, 1.
King. 3. 6. He walked before God in truth, and in righteousness and in
uprightness of heart; and of Hezekiah, Esaias 38. 3. I have walked before thee
in truth, and with a perfect heart. That which made them so upright and void of
hypocrisy in all their ways, was this, that they did walk before God, and
had him always in their eye.

2. It will yield unspeakable comfort to the conscience, even in affliction:
This was Jobs comfort, behold my witness is in heaven (says he, Job 16. 19.)
and my record is on high, and also Hezekiahs, Esaias 38. 3.

The means to try whether we walk with God, and are persuaded of his presence
is this. 1. When a man is the same alone and in company, when the sin that I
would not commit in the presence and knowledge of men, I forbear to do it,
when I am by my self alone, and have opportunity to commit it safely and
secretly. Thus Joseph showed that he walked with God: he durst not sin against
God in that sin that he was most strongly tempted unto, though he had
opportunity to have committed it secretly enough, Genesis 39. 9. 11. 2. When the
good duties I use to perform in open places, in the presence of others, I
accustom my self to them in secret. This our Savior prescribes, Matthew. 6.
6. Thou when thou prayest (says he) enter into thy closet, and when thou have
shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret.

Lecture the fifteenth, June 6. 1609.
IT follows now, that we proceed to the two last points in this Text 1. The
sin he charge her with, is the sin of fornication she now lived in. 2.
Though he knew she lived in this sin, he reiects her not. Where first, it
is to be observed, that though he tell her of the five husbands she had had,
yet, his meaning is, not to charge her with that, as with a sin, but only
with this, that the man she now kept; was not her husband. For (howsoever it be
in the judgment of Papists, who never give the Ecclesiastical blessing to
second marriages, and of all carnal and worldly men, who are ever apt to judge
profanely and irreverently of Gods holy ordinance in the state of wedlock) yet
is it no disgrace to a Christian woman in the sight of God, if the necessity,
or conueniency of her state, shall call her unto it, to have had five husbands.
So that the sin that Christ charge her with, was not that she had had five
husbands, but that the man she now had, was not her husband. This is evident by
four reasons. First, the Apostle gives liberty to every widow, to marry
again: 1. Cor. 7. 39. The wife is bound by the Law so long as her husband
lives, but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to marry with whom she
will, only in the Lord. 2. He calls the marriage of all persons honorable:
Heb. 13. 4. 3. He calls it a doctrine of devils, to condemn it, or hold it
unlawful: 1. Tim. 4. 1. 3. And 4. He commands it in some cases: 1. Tim. 5. 14.
(where he speaks of widows only) I will therefore (says he) that the
younger women marry and bear children. If any shall object, 1 Timothy 5 9. That
the Apostle would have none to be chosen for a Church-widdow, that has had
above one husband, which argues, that he esteemed it some blot, or infamy unto
a Christian woman, to have had more husbands then one; I answer, that he
excludes only such women, as being unjustly divorced (as many were in those
days) were during the life of their first husband, married to another man. So
that the fault he notes there, is the same which our Savior speaks of: Mark
10. 12. If a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she
commits aduicery.

Now it is to be observed, that our Savior, when he would effectually touch
the conscience of this woman, with the sense of sin, and bring her to
repentance, charge her not with all the sins he knew by her, (though
undoubtedly he knew many, and intended also to draw her from all her sins as
well as from one; and when she repented truly of this one sin, she repented of
all the rest) yet I say, he does not tell her here of all her sins; But (as he
has been also wont to deal with other of his servants in the like case) of
the huge heap, of her innumerable sins, he makes choice of one principal
and chief one, and lays that only to her charge, presses that only upon
her conscience, and this one principal, and chief sin, which amongst all her
sins, he makes choice of, for this purpose, is the fornication she lived in.
From hence then arises this instruction.

That among all the sins that men are given unto, Fornication is a principal
Doct.
sin, and will lie more heavy upon the conscience, and wound the soul more
deeply, then other sins; when God shall once effectually discover it to a man,
and charge him with it. See the proof of this in Job 31. Where being driven
(partly by the heavy hand of God, that lay upon him, partly by the unjust
accusations of his friends that charged him to be an hypocrite) to enter into a
serious examination, of the life that he had led, there is no one thing that he
could find, in the whole course of his life, that he took so much comfort in,
as this, that he had ever made conscience of, and kept himself free from this
sin: and therefore having begun with it, verse 1. to the 4. he speaks of it
again, verse 9. to 12. But mark what reasons he gives why he was so afraid
of this sin above others, verse 2. For what portion shall I have of God from
above, and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high? verse 3. Is not
destruction to the wicked, and strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?
and verse 11. For this an heinous crime (says he) yea it is an iniquity to
be punished by the Judges. verse 12. Yea, this is a fire that shall devour to
destruction, and which shall root out all mine increase.

The Reasons whereby this may appear, to be not only a sin, but one Reason.
of the heauiest and most fearful sins that a man can be guilty of, are
principally four.

1. It is not only a sin, but a mother-sinne, a cause of many other sins,
it draws men to many other sins, yea to other most heinous sins, Pro. 23.
28. She increases the transgressions among men. Do not prostitute thy
daughter (says the Lord, Leuit. 19. 29.) to cause her to be a whore, least the
land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.

2. It is not only a sin, but a punishment of other sins. I might allege
the punishments that God has been wont, and will certainly inflict on this
sin. But I reserve that to another place, Solomon in Eccles. 7. 26. speaking of
the woman, Whose heart is as nets and snares, and whose hands are as bands: he
adds, He that is good before God, shall be delivered from her, but the sinner
shall be taken by her, Pro. 22. 14. The mouth of a strange woman is as a deep
pit, he with whom the Lord is angry, shall fall therein. So Romans 1. 24.
Speaking of such as God gave up to their hearts lusts, and to uncleanness, and
verse 26. to vile affections, and verse 28. to a reprobate sense; he names the
sins that provoked God to deal thus with them, verse 28. they regarded not
to know God, and verse 21. when they knew God, they glorified him not as God,
nor were thankful. And therefore God gave them up to this sin. Many speak
much, how this sin abounds in such towns, where the Gospel has been most
plentifully and powerfully preached; and think they have great advantage
against religion for it; but indeed, this makes much for the honor of the
Gospel, that the Lord cannot endure the contempt of it, but uses to punish it
in this fearful manner. And who are they that in such places fall into this
sin? Surely such as either regard not to know God, Romans 1. 28. Or if they do
know him, have not glorified him as they ought, Romans 1. 21. but have been
hypocrites, and nourished under the profession of Religion some grievous sin,
Whosoever pleases God shall escape from her (says Solomon, Eccles. 7. 26.) but
the sinner shall be taken by her. Wonder rather, there be not more tainted with
this sin, seeing there are so many that regard not to hear, and of those
that do hear, so many that make no conscience of any thing that they hear.

3. There is no sin, that is so directly opposite to sanctification, and
holiness as this sin. Therefore as the Spirit of God is every where called the
Holy Ghost, because there is no one work wherein he shows himself,
wheresoever he dwells, more then in holiness; So the wicked spirit is called
the unclean spirit, Matthew. 12. 43. because there is no one sin, whereby it may
be better known where he dwells and reigns, then uncleanness Of all the
sins that man commits, there is no one, that has more force to quench the
Spirit, to dull, and banish all grace out of the heart then this sin has.
See the proof of this, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 3. 4. 5. For this is the will of God, even
your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication: That every one
of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor,
not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles that know not God, verse
7. For God has not called you unto uncleanness, but unto holiness. See how
sottish, Solomon became, after he had given himself to fleshly lusts, his
nines turned away his heart after other gods, (says the Holy Ghost, 1. King.
11. 4.) and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God. Yea it puts out
the light and judgment that was in man by nature, they that lived in lust were
given over, (...) says the Apostl^, Romans 1. 28. in a mind void of judgment.

4. There is no sin that is committed with such delight and pleasure as this
is, and therefore it must needs bring in the end more bitterness and anguish
to the soul, then other sins do. For the more pleasure men have found in sin,
the more bitterness shall they find in their consciences one day for sin,
Luke 6. 25. Woe be to you that laugh now, for ye shall wail and weep, and
16. 25. Remember thou in thy life time receiuedst thy pleasures, now therefore
thou art tormented. Therefore the Scripture speaks so often of the bitterness
of this sin: Heb. 12. When he had said verse 15. Let no root of bitterness
spring up and trouble you. He adds verse 16. Let there be no Fornicator, Job
13. 26. When in the beginning of the verse he had said, that the Lord wrote
bitter things against him, charged him with bitter sins, he adds what those
bitter things were, Thou causest me to possess the sins of my youth. These
tricks of youth will be bitter to men one day, Pro. 5. 3. The lips of a strange
woman drop as the honey comb, verse 4. But the end of her is bitter as
wormwood, and sharp as a two edged sword, Eccles. 7. when he had said ver.
25. That he had compassed about to know wickedness and folly, the foolishness
of madness, he adds verse 26. I find more bitter then death, the woman whose
heart is as nets and snares, etc.

Lecture the sixteenth, June 13. 1609.
IT follows now; that we come to the Uses, that are to be made of the
Doctrine we have heard, touching the heinousness of the sin of Fornication;
which the last day (being prevented by the time) we could not deliver.

And this Doctrine serves: Use. 1.


To convince the judgment, and conscience, of them that live in this sin
without fear. For it is evident (and all honest men complain of it) that this
sin abounds every where; Yea many, that esteem themselves Christians, read
the Word, hear it, come to such assemblies as this, sit before us, and look
us in the face, when we speak against this sin: do yet live in this sin,
and live securely in it; as if all that is said out of Gods Word against it,
were but a Fable. And what is the cause of this? Surely, somewhat there is that
deceiues them, that they cannot perceive, it is so dangerous a matter to live
in this sin, as indeed it is.

It may truly be said of all sin, that Satan draws a man to it, and
hardens him in it by some error of his mind or other, whereby he deceives
him. How drew he our first Parents first to sin, 1. Tim. 2. 14. The woman was
deceived, and found in the transgression, 2. Pet. 3. 17. Beware least ye be
plucked away with the error of the wicked, and fall from your own
steadfastness. What is that that hardens a man's heart in sin? The Apostle will
tell us, Heb. 3. 13. Least any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of
sin. What are those strong holds, that keep the Word, and grace of God, from
entering into, and conquering the heart of man? The Apostle will tell us that
there are certain imaginations, and thoughts, which Satan puts into the
mind, which till they be cast down, we can never be brought to the obedience
of Christ, 2. Cor. 10. 4, 5. And as this may be said of all sin, so specially
of this; Satan puts many erroneous conceits, and imaginations into the minds
of men, whereby he deceiues them, and makes them think, it can be no matter of
great danger to live in this sin. Therefore the Apostle speaking of the
danger of this sin, says, 1. Cor. 6. 9. be not deceived, neither
Fornicators, nor Adulterers, nor Wantons, etc. and Ephesians. 5. 5, 6. When he had
said this, Ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person has any inheritance
in the Kingdom of Christ, and of God, he adds, Let no man deceive you with
vain words. And thus Solomon describes the man that is drawn to it; Pro. 7.
22. 23. He goes after her straightway, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or
a fool to the correction of the stocks, till a dart strike through his liver.
As a bird hastes to the snare, and knows not that it is for his life. If his
understanding were not blinded, if he knew well what he did, if he were not a
fool, and as void of the true use of his reason, as the bruit beast is, he
could not do as he does.

I will therefore endeavor by the weapons of our warr-fare, such as I have
received from the Lords Armory (the holy Scriptures) to cast down those
thoughts and Imaginations, whereby Satan deceiues men in this case, and
hardens them in this sin. And these weapons, if you will receive them, and
learn to use them, you shall find will be mighty through God to cast down
strong holds, as the Apostle speaks, 2. Cor. 10. 4. This is the sovereign
Preservative to keep us from all Satan's Temptations. By the words of thy lips
(says David, Psalm. 17. 4.) I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.

Now the means whereby Satan deceiues men, and draws so many into this
sin, I find to be principally four. 1. The generality of this sin. 2.
The hope of secrecy. 3. The hope of impunity. 4. The hope of repentance, and so
of pardon.

1. The generality of this sin deceives many: How can this be so great a
sin (think they) that is so common in all places, and among all 1.
sorts and conditions of men? How usual is this among such as are of chief
credit, yea, are not many professors faulty in this? yea, are there not
Preachers, and good Preachers too, that will do as bad as this comes unto,
and worse too?

This error has of old deceived many: The example of some persons does
strangely comfort and harden men in sin. The Prophet says, Ezekiel. 16. 54.
that the Jews by their Iewdnesse and evil example, were a comfort unto them,
of Sodom and Samaria. When a sin is become common, and grown into fashion,
it is presently counted no sin, or no great sin at least. See how this
hardened them, Ier. 44. 17. We will burn incense to the Queen of heaven. And
why, we have done it, and not we only, but our Fathers, our Kings, and our
Princes in the Cities of Judea, and in the streets of Jerusalem. And surely
these times are such, and this sin is grown so common, as men shall have
much ado to preserve themselves, and their families from it. As when the
Plague is in a town, if but some one or two houses be infected, a man may
without danger go to the town, and live in it: but if the infection grow
general, all men are afraid of it: so is it in this case. This made the
Prophet complain so, Esaias 6. 5. Woe is me for I am undone, because I am a man
of unclean lips (apt to offend in my speech, and how can I choose, but be so?
For) I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.

So that there is small hope, I shall any more prevail in speaking against
this sin now, then Lot did when he sought to oppose himself to the multitude
in the like case, Genesis 19. 4. All the men of Sodom from the young to the old,
even all from all quarters had compassed his house, and he verse 7. sought to
persuade with them, but verse 9. see their answer, He is come alone as a
stranger, and shall he judge and rule?

Yet because Gods sheep will hear his voice, Ioh. 10. 27. I will give you out
of Gods Word, some sovereign preservatives against this temptation. Resp.


No man's example should be the rule of our conscience, that were to prefer
Preser. 1.
man before God. And it is a poor excuse, a poor comfort, for any to say,
such a man's example drew me to this. What help found Adam in this excuse, when
he said, Genesis 3. 12. The woman gave me of the tree, and I did cate? Nay it is
a token of Gods wrath upon thee to lay such stumbling blocks before thee,
Matthew. 18. 7. Woe be to the world, because of offenses. And it is a certain
sign of reprobation in thee, that thou stumblest, and take occasion to fall
by such examples. Those whom God has ordained to destruction, he will lay
stumbling blocks before them, that they may perish: as he threatens, Ier. 6.
21. Behold I will lay stu^bling blocks before this people, and the fathers, and
the sons together shall fall upon them, the neighbor, and his friend shall
perish.

No sin is the less odious, nor the danger of it the less, because it is
common: for as it is certain, the greatest part shall be damned, Matthew. 7. 2
1^. Broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there be which go
in thereat. God has made Tophet wide and large, as the Prophet speaks, Esaias
30. 33. So (though with men many times it be a means of immunitie from
punishment to a lewd man, that he has many that join with him in that sin,
yet) with God it is not: Though hand join in hand (says Solomon, Pro. 11.
21.) the wicked shall not be unpunished, Nay the more common a sin is, the
more odious it is to God: and the more dangerous for them that live in it. For
nothing will hasten Gods vengeance so much as that. It was the generality of
sin in the old world that brought destruction upon it, Ge^. 6. 12. And upon
Sodom likewise, Genesis 19. 4. See a notable proof of this, Ier. 5. 7. How
should I spare thee for this? and verse 9. Shall I not visit for these things?
Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? And mark the reason
why the Lord must needs be avenged, verse. 7, 8. They committed adultery; and
assembled themselves by companies in Harlots houses: every man neyed after his
neighbors wife. And yet (though the generality of sin do hasten and
increase Gods vengeance upon men in this life) if it would be any mitigation to
the torments they should endure in hell, that they shall there have so many
good fellows to bear them company, the matter were the less: but this shall
also increase their torment there. As may appear by that suit the rich man
makes to Abraham, Luke 16. 28. that no^e of his brethren might come to him,
into that place of torment.

So that (if we have grace) this should not cause us to make the less account
of this sin, that it is now grown so general; but this should cause us to
hate it the more, and be the more afraid of it, and take so much the more heed
to preserve our selves, and our families from it. So the wickedness of the
time, and place that Lot lived in, affected him. His righteous soul was vexed
with it, 2. Pet. 2. 8. So speaks David of himself, Psalm. 119. 53. Horror
has taken hold upon me, because of the wicked that forsake thy law.

The second deceit whereby Satan draws men to this sin, and hardens them in
it, is hope of secrecy. That they may commit it, and live in it, and yet it
shall never be descryed or known; or if they cannot be so close (if they
accustom themselves to it long) but men will surmise somewhat, and judge the
worst, yet so long as none can convince them, what need they care. They see
many that would cry out upon, and thrust away out of their house, any that
should be evidently convinced of the fact; that yet think never the worse of
any for surmises, and presumptions, be they never so strong. Nay it is
certain, many are the better liked for this: as if it were an argument of
great wit, and sufficiency in any to be able to take their pleasure in this
sin, and yet so to save their own credit, and the credit of the family that
they live in. And this is the cause of the monstrous, and unnatural practices
that many use to cover, and hide this sin by. That this is a principal thing
that deceiues many, is evident not only by experience, but by that that the
Scripture speaks, Job 24. 15. The eye of the Adulterer waits for the
twilight, and says none eye shall see me, and disguiseth his face. And indeed
they that live in this vile and abominable sin, are usually marvelous close
and secret, and subtle to conceal it. The Harlot is said (Pro. 7. 10.) to be
subtle of heart. See also the subtlety of these sinners noted and described,
Pro. 30. 19, 20. The Prophet Agur reckons the way of a man with a maid, and
the way of an adulterous woman, (the cunning and secret practices of filthy
persons of both sexes for the hiding of their sin) among these things which
neither himself nor any other man was possibly able to discover and find out,
and compares it unto the way of three things, which no wit or industry of man
is able to descrie.

The preservative against this temptation is the meditation of these three
Preseru.
points.

1. That God is present with thee at all times, and in all places, and
beholds 1.
the secretest of all thy actions, yea in such places, and in such company as
no good man dare go into, in which thou may be sure to be free enough from
the censuring eye and tongue of those precise fellows whom thou fear and
hate so much; yet will the Lord be with thee even there. If I make my bed in
hell (says David, Psalm. 149. 8. as indeed the places where such companions
often use to lodge, are little better) behold thou art there. This God
alleges as a forcible reason against this sin, Ier. 13. 27. I have seen
the lewdness of thy whoredoms. And Ier. 29. 23. Even I know, and am a
witness faith Lord. This meditation did Job great good in this case, Job 31. 4
Does not be behold all my ways and tell my steps? O if thou could remember
that he sees thee, and set thy self in his presence, and bring thy heart to
that pass, that thou could even desire ever to have his company, and that he
would ever take notice of thy ways, this would preserve thee from this, and
all other sins. Why will thou my son (says the wisdom of God, Pro. 5. 20,
2^.) Embrace the bosom of a stranger? For the ways of man are before the eyes
of the Lord; and he pondereth all his goings.

Thou would not commit this sin, if thou were sure thy pastor, thy
neighbor, thy servant, thy child should know of it: thou would seem to
them to be another manner of person. And that is the cause why you shall have
the most notorious Harlots, that will seem very religious, I have peace
offerings with me (says the Harlot, Pro. 7. 14) this day have I paid my
vows. O the Atheism of thy heart, take notice of it, mourn for it, strive
against it, pray against it. Thou fear the eye of a mortal man, and fear
not the presence of the eternal God: who (according to that which he
threatens, Mal. 3. 5.) will be a swift witness against the adulterers. Yea
the Lord has often brought unclean persons (sometimes by terror of conscience,
sometimes by frenzy) to that pass, that themselves have been the blazers and
proclaimers of their own secret filthiness. He has constrained many of them to
cry out of themselves as the Leper, Leuit. 13. 45. I am unclean, I am
unclean. Or rather as Judas did, Matthew. 27. 4. who in extreme desperation,
and having received in himself the sentence of his eternal damnation, cried
out openly and cared not who heard, saying I have sinned. And what know thou
(that art so confident in the secrecy of thy sin) but either thy self or the
party with whom thou committest this lewdness, may be brought to this pass
before thou die? The meditation of this point is prescribed by our Savior, for
a preservative against hypocrisy, and this conceit of sinning secretly and
closely in any kind, Luke 12. 1, 2. Beware of the leven of the Pharisees which
is hypocrisy: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed, nor
hid that shall not be made known.

2. The more cunning thou have been in keeping thy sin secret, the more does
God abhor thee, 2. King. 17. 9. The children of Israel had done things
secretly, that were not upright before the Lord, says the Holy Ghost, when he
would aggrauate their sin, and show the cause why God destroyed them. The
more wit, and cunning any man shows in contriuing of sin, the more culpable
he is before God. Thus God aggrauateth their sin, Ier. 4. 22. They are wise to
do evil, Romans 16. 19. I would have you wise to that that is good, and simple,
concerning evil.

3. No unclean person can have any assurance of hope, that his sin shall
always be kept secret. In the day of the Lord all men's secrets shall be
discovered to all the world, 1. Cor. 4. 5. He will then lighten all things that
are hid in darkness. Then shall every unclean person be made a gazing stock
to the world, and to Angels, and to men, as the Apostle speaks, 1. Cor. 4. 5.
in another case. And even in this life God does strangely discover many
unclean persons that have lived long in secret. Solomon brings in the
fornicator complaining and bewailing his misery, even in this respect, Pro. 5.
14. I was almost brought into the extremity of misery in the midst of the
congregation and assembly. And observe this in them that are the cunningest in
this sin, that (though no body peradventure can convince them evidently of
the fact) yet every body (through this just judgment of God) condemns them
for it. As the Lord sees their secretest villainies, so even in this life, often
times he uses to testify against them.

Lecture the seventeenth, June 20. 1609.
THe third error of mind, whereby Satan deceiues men, and draws them to
this sin, and hardens them in it, is the hope of impunity. For (says he)
admit thou do slip, and have the ill fortune to be discovered, what shall thou
be the worse for it?

1. With men thou shall not fare much the worse for this. The civil Magistrate
1.
will not meddle with thee. All the punishment is (if thou be a poor body)
but to stand a while in the Church, and say thou art sorry for it: and if thou
be rich, thou may avoid that too: but what is that?

And secondly, as for thy credit, thou shall not lose much: unless it be with
a sort of Precisians, whom every man despises. But for the most, thou see 2.
they will like never the worse of any for this, not of a servant, nor of a
neighbor. Nay, thou may see, that men that make most open profession of this
sin, are esteemed and desired by many, as the best companions: and professors
also will be as ready to show any kindness to such as are noted for this, as
to any other.

And thirdly, as for the Lord, thou can see no cause to think that he likes
much the worse of a man for this. If he did, neither thy self, nor many 3.
others that thou know could prosper as they do.

This (as both experience, and the Scripture teach us) preuailes marueilously
with most men, Eccl. 8. 11. Because sentence against an evil work is not
executed speedily, therefore the heart of the children of men, is fully set in
them to do evil. See also the force that is in this to harden men in all kind
of sin, Mal. 3. 15. We call the proud happy (say the profane of that age) yea
they that work wickedness are set up, yea they that tempt the Lord are even
delivered. Certainly, if the law had as well provided for, and the sword of
the Magistrate were as ready to be drawn out for the punishment of this sin,
as of theft, we should have as few whoremongers as thieves. Or if in the want
of the law in this case, all such as are esteemed honest, and free from this
sin themselves, would but hate it in others, and discountenance it as they
might; doubtless they might restrain many from it.

But first the law has not appointed any punishment for it, that is any way
proportionable to the heinousness of the sin: And secondly, the civil
Magistrate almost every where is unwilling to use that authority that the law
has given him for the punishment of this sin; but counts it as a disparagement
unto him to meddle with it at all: And thirdly, the punishment of carting and
whipping, which was wont to be inflicted (especially in Market towns) is
grown out of use: And fourthly, some Magistrates and private persons, do make
so light account of this sin, that it is not to be wondered at, that this sin is
grown so common as it is.

For the conuincing of this error, and preserving men from it, two things are
to be considered. Answ.


First, that though the Magistrate do not, yet it is his duty to punish this
sin, as far as law gives liberty, and his great sin that he does not: And
though private Christians do not, yet it is their duty to show detestation to
this sin.

Secondly, though men fail in their duty, yet is there no cause any should
commit this sin upon hope of impunity, for though men do not, yet will God
certainly punish this sin.

For first, as for the Magistrate, we know that by his calling he is Custos
vtriusque tabulae, and charged with the law of God to see it kept by those that
are under his authority. He is the Minister of God to take vengeance on him
that does evil, Romans 13. 4. The authority he has, and the pre-eminence God
has given him above other men, is given him to that end. And the Magistrate is
bound by Gods law to punish this sin as well as any other, Job 31. 11. This
is a wickedness, and an iniquity to be punished, by the Judges.

And both of the Magistrate, and of every private Christian this is required
(as he desires that Gods mercy should be upon him and his posterity) that he
abhor this sin, and do that that in him lies, to bring it unto shame and
punishment, Amos 5. 15. Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish
judgment in the gate; it may be that the Lord God of hosts will be merciful
to the remnant of Jacob.

I know it is esteemed by many a sign of a good nature, and disposition to be
kind to all persons how lewd soever they be. But mark what the Holy Ghost in
the Scripture speaks of this kindness. 1. He makes it a sign that a man has
no fear of God in him when he cannot abhor sin, Psalm. 36. 1, 4. 2. He says
that that man makes no conscience of sin himself, that is ready to speak in
favor of a lewd man, Pro. 28. 4. They that forsake the law praise the wicked,
and are apt to speak for them, and to take their part: but they that keep the
law, set themselves against them. 3. He makes it a greater sign of an
ungracious heart for a man to favor sin in others, then to commit sin
himself, Romans 1. 31. Which men (though they know the law of God, how that they
that commit such things are worthy of death yet) not only do the same, but
also favor them that do them.

And whereas on the other side it is counted pride, and malice, and cruelty,
for a man to seek the disgrace, or punishment of any lewd person, the Holy
Ghost says, there is no true love in any, but in such only.

1. There is no true love to God in any, that cannot unfeignedly hate sin,
whereby he is dishonored, Psalm. 97. 10. Ye that love the Lord, hate the thing
that is evil.

2. There is no true love to our selves, to our families, and the place we
live in, unless we hate such sins as will bring Gods curse upon us. Till
Achan was punished, Gods curse was upon the whole host of Israel, Josh. 7. 12.
Neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the excommunicate from
among you. And see what a blessing, Phineas brought both upon his own house,
and upon all Israel, by the zealous hatred he showed against this sin, in
the punishing of Zimry and Cozby, Numbers 25. 11, 12.

3. There is no true love in any to their neighbors and country, but in such
only. For the shame and punishment, that one man is brought unto, is a means
to restrain many from committing this sin, and so to preserve them from the
curse of God that is due unto it. That is the reason, the Lord gives for the
severity that he enjoined the Magistrate to use, Deuteronomy. 13. 11. That all Israeli
may hear, and fear, and do no more any such wickedness as this among you.

4. There is no true love to the sinner himself in any but in such only. For
the disgrace and punishment that he is brought unto, is the likeliest and best
means to bring him to true repentance, Psalm. 83. 16. Fill their faces with
shame, that they may seek thy name O Lord, 2 Thessalonians. 3. 14. If any man obey
not our sayings, have no company with him that he may be ashamed, verse 15.
yet count him not as an enemy.

Secondly, It is no advantage to the unclean person that men fail in their
duty, and do not show that detestation to his sin that they ought to do. For
all kind of sinners may assuredly look for plagues from God even in this life,
though Magistrates should wink at them. Behold (says Solomon, Pro. 11. 31.)
the righteous shall be recompensed on the earth, much more the wicked and the
sinner. And Eccl. 8. 12, 13. Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and
his days be prolonged; Yet surely, I know, that it shall be well with them
that fear God, which fear before him. But it shall not be well with the
wicked, neither shall be prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he
fears not before God, Nah. 1. 2, 3. God is jealous, and the Lord reuengeth;
the Lord reuengeth, and is furious, the Lord will take vengeance on his
adversaries, and he reserueth wrath for his enemies. The Lord is slow to
anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked: The Lord has
his way in the Whirlwind, and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of
his feet. But of all sinners, none have more cause to look for fearful
judgments from God, then they that live in this sin. For God hates this
sin, and will certainly punish, and plague it: though men do not. Yea,
there is no one sin, (specially against the second Table) which he has set
more evident marks of his indignation upon, and witnessed it, by executing his
judgments upon men for it, then this. Is not destruction to the wicked (says
Job, speaking of this sin, Job 31. 3.) and a strange punishment to the workers
of iniquity, Heb. 13. 4. Whoremongers, and Adulterers, God will judge. For this
very sin, therefell of Israel in one day, three and twenty thousand, 1. Cor.
10. 8. And the Apostle tells us that all judgments, that befall a Nation, a
Country, or Town, are to be imputed chiefly to this sin, Ephesians. 5. 6. Let no
man deceive you with vain words, for because of these things comes the wrath
of God upon the children of disobedience. But I will show you more particularly
how God is wont to punish this sin: And I am deceived, if any one sin has
so many punishments, so particularly threatened in the word against it, as this
has.

1. God plagues men in their bodies for this sin. Not only as Solomon
speaks, because Pro. 5. 11. It consumes the flesh, and the body, but he has
invented a plague proper, and peculiar to this sin: even that infectious, and
loathsome disease, which at the first was called the disease of Naples, and
after, the French disease, but now may as well be called the English disease.
For of very many in all places, that may now be said, which Zophar speaks to
Job 20. 11. His bones are full of the sin of his youth, and it shall lie
down with him in the dust. Other diseases may well be called the fruits of
sin: but is there any sin that has a disease that is so natural a fruit
of it, and that bears his name in the forehead thereof, so as this does?

2. God plagueth men in their goods for this sin, Pro. 6. 26. Because of the
whorish woman, a man is brought to a morsel of bread, Job 24. 18. Their
portion shall be cursed upon the earth. Many a man is brought to beggary by
it. Yea, this sin is able to destroy Kings, as Salomons mother taught him,
Pro. 31. 3.

3. God plagueth men in their good name, and reputation for this sin, Pro. 6.
33. He shall find dishonor, and his reproach shall never be put away. Let him
have never so much wealth, and power, he shall have no true credit, nor
estimation with men, no not with his own servants, or children, or such as are
most bound unto him. God told David, that when he committed this sin, he
despised him, 2. Sam. 12. 10. And those that despise God, shall be sure to be
despised, 1. Sam. 2. 30.

4. God plagueth men in their posterity for this sin, Job 31. 12. This is a
fire, that shall devour to destruction, and root out all mine increase, Job
21. 19. God will lay up the sorrow of the father, for his children. Many a
goodly family has been overthrown by this sin. Yea, for this sin God
denies a posterity to many. It is not only the curse whereby God threatens the
man that commits incestuous uncleanness that he shall die childlesse, Leuit.
20. 20, 21. but of all adulterers and fornicators, also the Lord says, Hos. 4.
10. they shall commit whoredom and shall not increase. Judah though in all
likelihood he were but thirty years old when he lay with Tamar, Genesis 38. and
had two sons by her yet do we never read that he had any child after: sure
it is that from them two only, and Selah whom he had before, the families of
Judah are reckoned, Genesis 46. 12. Number. 26. 19. 22. 1. Chron. 2. 3, 4.

5. God plagueth the family, and town, where such men dwell, for this sin,
Gen 29. 18. God shut up every womb of the house of Abimilech because of Sarah,
when there was but a purpose in him to commit adultery with Sarah, though he
intended it unwittingly altogether. The family and town is polluted and made
guilty of sin, Ier. 2. 2. Thou have polluted the Land with thy whoredoms,
Number. 25. 1. The people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab;
and verse 3. The wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel; and verse 4. He
sent a plague, that consumed twenty four thousand.

6. Because many an unclean person will be ready to say: none of all these
plagues, I thank God have hitherto, nor do now touch me: I say unto such men.

1. The longer Gods plagues are deferred, the heavier they will be ^hen they
come: the longer he is fetching his blow, the deeper will he cut when he
smites, Romans 9. 22. The cause why God suffers with long patience the vessels of
wrath prepared for destruction, is, that he might show his wrath, and make his
power known upon them the more.

2. Thou may be plagued of God with a plague that is of all others most
grievous, and never feel it: thou may be plagued in thy soul, and
conscience, Pro. 6. 32. He that does it destroys his own soul. When God
would punish Pharaoh, so as he might make his power seen upon him, Romans 9.
17. He punished him with hardness of heart, Exodus 9. 12. which was a greater
plague then all the rest of the plagues of Egypt. So this is spoken of as of
the most fearful punishment, Romans 1. 28. When God gives a man up to a
Reprobate mind.

3. If thou were altogether spared in this life, and neither punished in thy
body, nor in thy soul, yet is there another place prepared for thee, where
thou shall be sure to be punished; with far more fearful punishments then
any can be felt here. Thou shall never be able (continuing in thy sin) to
escape the damnation of hell, which is in a special sort threatened against
this sin, whoremongers shall be sure to have their part in the lake that
burns with fire and brimstone which is the second death, Apoc. 21. 8. That
makes Solomon say, they are as near to hell, as they that have one foot there
already, Pro. 5. 5. Her feet go down to death, her steps take hold on hell.
And Pro. 9. 18. Her guests are in the depth of hell.

And as the Lords forbearing wicked men in this life, and causing them to
prosper, is a certain argument he has determined to reserve their full
punishment for hell, it is an evidence token of a righteous judgment to come
(says the Apostle, (...). These. 1. (...). 6) when wicked men are spared here.
So is it said that of all sinners the Lord has chiefly reserved the unclean
persons to be punished there, 2. Pet. 1. 9. 10.

And by how much the more they have been spared here, by how much the more
patience, and bounty the Lord has showed them here: by so much the more
grievous, and fearful shall their torment be there, Luke 16. 25. Son,
remember (says Abraham to Dives) That thou in thy life time receiuedst thy
good things, and likewise Lazarus evil thing, but now he is comforted, and
thou art tormented. And Romans 2. 4, 5. Despisest th^n the riches of his
goodness, and forbearance, and long suffering, not knowing that the goodness
of God leads thee to repentance. But after thy hardness and impenitent
heart, treasurest up unto thy self wrath against the day of wrath, and
revelation of the righteous judgment of God.

So that if thou were wise, thou would think it no advantage to thee, that
thou have so well escaped all the plagues which God has threatened against thy
sin in this life; but desire rather that the Lord would punish thee here
(where he always uses in wrath to remember mercy) and not reserve thy whole
punishment for the life to come, where there shall be judgment without mercy:
his punishments there shall have no mixture of mercy in them.

Lecture the eighteenth, June 27. 1609.
THe fourth and last error of mind whereby Satan draws men to uncleanness,
and hardneth them in it, is the hope of repentance, and so of pardon.

For there are very many whom he cannot so far blind, but they know it is a
sin, and a heinous sin, and a sin that they are sure they shall be
damned for, if they should not repent of it. But such he encourages to this
sin, by persuading them. 1. Thou know by the Scripture, that whenever
thou shall repent thee of it: (though it be not before thy death) God will
surely pardon it, Ezekiel. 18. 21. 2. Thou have no cause to doubt, but thou shall
be able to repent, and dye in Gods favor. For 1. Thou see many that have
lived in this sin, that yet have now left it, 2. Many that although they
never left it before, yet on their death beds have repented, and dyed as well
as any. And thirdly, thine own experience will tell thee what thou art able to
do. For have thou not often felt that thou have repented and been sorry for
this sin after thou have committed it? 3. And if thou may but dye well, dye
in Gods favor, what need thou care for more? No matter how thou live, so
thou may dye well.

Thus seemed he to have persuaded Balaam, Let me die the death of the
righteous, and let my last end be like his says he, Number. 23. 10. And with this
deceit (doubtless) he persuades many, and preuailes more with men, then by
any other of his tentations and subtilties whatsoever. For what is the cause
why you shall find men, much more careful to conceal this sin from men,
then from God; Yea, they will not stick to commit perjury, and murder (which
are far more heinous offenses against God) that they may hide their
whoredoms from men. Surely they think they may be bold with God, it is no
matter how they provoke him, they can deal well enough with him; he is more
merciful, and ready to forgive then man is; and if they do but repent, and
say they are sorry for their sin, he will forgive them straight.

Now the preservative, and remedy against this so dangerous a deceit of Satan,
consists of three points, 1. The true knowledge of God, and of his
disposition, toward such sinners. 2. The true knowledge of ourselves, and of
that state we cast our selves into, when once we fall into such sins. 3. The
true knowledge of the danger we have brought the party unto, with whom we have
committed this sin.

First; It cannot be denied, but the Lord (to them whom he loves in Christ) is
infinitely more merciful, then any man can be, to them whom he loves most
dearly. That made David say: 2. Sam. 24. 14. Let me now fall into the hand of
the Lord (for his mercies are great) and let me not fall into the hand of man.
And when the Lord had spoken of his great mercy: He will have mercy upon him,
our God is very ready to forgive. He amplifieth it, verse 8. by comparing his
mercy with the mercies of man. My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are
your ways my ways, but verse 9. As the heavens are higher then the earth: So
are my ways higher then your ways, and my thoughts then your thoughts.

But as he is more merciful then any man: so he hates sin more then any man
can do. Hab. 1. 13. He cannot see, he cannot beheld it, Psalm. 11. 5. The
wicked, and him that loves iniquity does his soul hate, verse 6. Upon the
wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and stormy tempest, this is
the portion of their cup.

Yea Christ (through whom only we hope to find mercy with God) hates sin
with an infinite hatred, Exodus 23. 21. Provoke him not, for he will not spare
your misdeeds, because my name is in him. And it is a far more fearful
thing for a wicked man (though not for such a one as David was) to fall into
his hands, to have his displeasure, then the displeasure of all the men in the
world, Heb. 10. When the Apostle had said, verse 30. Uengeance is mine, I will
recompense, says the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people,
Whereas some desperate sinner might have said (as now many do) if that be all,
I care not; let me shun the shame and punishment of the world, and (as for
the Lord) I shall do well enough with him: he adds verse 31. It is a
fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, Psalm. 75. 7. Thou
even thou art to be feared; and who shall stand in thy sight when thou art
angry? This the Elect have felt. This made David cry out, Psalm. 51. 4. Against
thee, thee only have I shunned, and done this evil in thy sight. His worldly
punishment, and shame never troubled him in comparison of this. And this shall
the wickedest man in the world feel one day when God shall awaken his
conscience. He shall wish rather he had to deal with all the men in the world
then with the Lord: he will make no reckoning of the displeasure, and contempt
of the whole world in respect of the Lords wrath. See an experiment of this in
Judas: he cared not for displeasing the chief Priests and Elders, nor for
shaming himself so publicly; but the wrath of God which he had the sense of,
was intolerable to him, Mat. 27. 4, 5. And if the wrath of God be so
intolerable in this life to the wicked, what shall it be in the day of wrath
(as the day of judgment is called, Romans 2. 5.) Surely, the stoutest and most
profane sinners that in this life have made so small account of Gods
displeasure, and thought they could do well enough with him, and have gloried
so much in Christ, Apoc. 6. 15. 17. Even Kings and Captains, and every bond
man, and every freeman, shall cry to the mountains and rocks, fall on us, and
hide us from the presence of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of
the Lamb: for the great day of his wrath is come, and who can stand?

2. As ready as the Lord is to forgive sin, and easy to be entreated, yet
can he not pardon any but upon their unfeigned repentance. It is as possible for
a woman to be delivered of a child in her sleep: as for a man to be delivered
from the guilt and punishment of this sin, before he have unfeignedly repented.
Christ is called a Prince, and a Savior to give repentance unto Israel, and
remission of sins, Acts 5. 31. He can give remission of sins to none, but such
as he has given repentance unto.

3. Though the Lord be so merciful, that upon repentance he gives pardon to
every sinner, yet such a man's sin may be, that the Lord will most severely and
sharply correct, and scourge him for it; even after he has repented, and
obtained mercy and pardon. For though when God pardons sin, he remit not
only the guilt of it, but the punishment also: yet he chastises often times
very sharply such as he has pardoned. See an excellent experiment of this in
David, when Nathan had dealt particularly with him, he repented and God
pardoned his sin, 2. Sam. 12. 13. But did he hear no more of his sin after
he had repented? yes: the outward miseries threatened by the Prophet, 2. Sam.
12. 10, 11. fell all upon him for all that. And he endured such inward anguish
of conscience, as put him to such pain, as if all his bones had been broken
with it, Ps. 51. 8. And in comparison whereof all his outward miseries seemed
but as flea-bitings to him.

And if thou belong unto him, be sure he will deal with thee also after this
manner. Let no man therefore say: howsoever I have lived, if I repent, I shall
never be damned, and so long I care not. For though thou may be sure thou shall
never be damned, if thou can unfeignedly repent, yet may thou for all thy
repentance fall into many great miseries in this life, such as may make thy
heart to ache: and such as (if thou could believe and think upon) thou
would be loath to buy thy sweetest sins at so dear a rate. The Magistrate
(thou see) has many punishments for sin besides death: he has the stocks
and the jail, and the whip, and the pillorie, etc. and so has the Lord.

Now come I to the second preservative against this tentation: which is the
true knowledge of our selves, and of that estate we come into, when once we
fall into such sins; for every unclean person has just cause to fear, that
when once he has committed this sin, he shall never be able to repent of it.

This I prove by four reasons.

1. No man is able to repent of himself, but it is a great and supernatural
grace of God, whereby any man is made able to repent, 2. Tim. 2. 25, 26. In
meekness instruct those that oppose themselves, if God peradventure will give
them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth. And that they may recover
themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his
will. Observe in those words. 1. This comes of Gods gift only. 2. That every
sinner is in Satan's snare, out of which it must needs be hard to get out. When
once a man has fallen into any sin against his conscience, it is natural for
him to go on in it further and further, till his heart be hardened in it, Ephesians.
4. 18, 19. The Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind, Having their
understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, through the
ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart, who being
past feeling, have given themselves over unto lasciviousness; to work all
uncleanness with greediness. It is natural for sin to harden the heart,
and to deprive a man of that sense and trouble he found when he first committed
it; Heb. 3. 13. Take heed least any of you be hardened through the
deceitfulness of sin. Yea when a man has once accustomed himself to any
sin, he cannot leave it, or repent of it, though he would, no more then the
Leopard can change his spots, Ier. 13. 23.

2. God has threatened to punish such as sin against the light of their
hearts presumptuously, by withdrawing his grace from them, and hardening their
hearts, Deuteronomy. 29. 19, 20. He will not spare that man that blesses himself in
his heart. Because I have purged thee (says the Lord, Ezekiel. 24. 13.) and thou
wast not purged: thou shall not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I
have caused my fury to rest upon thee. When Pharaoh had hardened his heart
first, by continuing in sin, and resisting the work of Gods grace in him,
Exodus 8. 15. then did God harden his heart in a supernatural manner, Exodus 9.
12.

3. Above all sins, God has specially threatened to punish this sin with
hardness of heart, and impenitency, Prou. 2. 19. None that go unto her (the
strange woman) return again, neither take they hold on the paths of life. And
Prou. 23. 27. An Whore is a deep ditch, and a strange wom^ is a narrow pit. Of
these sinners chiefly it is said, that God reserueth them to the day of
judgment to be punished, 2. Pet. 2. 9, 10.

4. Experience proves this also. For, 1. Observe it, and you shall find that
they that are once given up to this sin, are more impudent then other
sinners; more graceless, profane, and blasphemous; deriders and contemners of
all piety. Therefore impudent sinners are said to have a Whores forehead, Ier.
3. 3. And that is thus described, Pro. 7. 13. She caught him and kissed him.
Therefore are they compared to dogs, Deuteronomy. 23. 18. 2. Sam. 3. 8. Therefore they
are said to be destitute of understanding: and to have lost even the light of
nature, Pro. 6. 32. and 7. 7. and Prou. 9. 13. the whore her self is said to
be simple and to know nothing. And the lewd man that is allured and overcome by
her, (verse. 16.) is said to be simple and void of understanding. (...). We have
known many that have fallen into this sin, and lived in it: but how many
have we known that have truly repented? It is a strange speech of Solomon,
Eccl. 7. 28. One man among a thousand have I found, but a woman among all those
have I not found.

I cannot deny, but we may have known many that have come thus far as to
confess this sin, and to show sorrow for it, and to leave it also: but alas,
there is more required to true repentance then this comes to.

1. Not every sinner that can confess his sin, may be said to repent: for,
then Pharaoh repented, Exodus 9. 27. And Judas also, Mat. 27. 3, 4. But he that
confesses it, 1. Particularly, as Achan upon Ioshuahs fatherly counsel did,
Josh. 7. 20. 2. Freely, without extenuating of it, or excusing it, as Paul did
his, 1. Tim. 1. 13. 15. Dan. 9. 4. 19. Of the sixteen verses that contain his
prayer, fourteen of them are spent in confessing and aggravating of their
sins. 3. With grief and shame, as Gods people did, 1. Sam. 7. 6. when in
their fast they shed tears, so abundantly, as if they had drawn buckets full
of the water, and powered them out before the Lord.

2. Not every sinner that sorroweth for sin, may be said to repent; for so
much is also said of Judas, Mat. 27. 4. And of Ahab too, 1. King. 21. 19. But
he that sorroweth, 1. Deeply and seriously, as a man would mourn for the loss
of his only son, or of his firstborn, Zach. 12. 10. And proportionably to
the quality of his sin, as Manasses did, 2. Chron. 33. 12. 2. Constantly,
suffering sorrow to abide upon his heart; and not seeking to put it off by
worldly comforts, before it have had a good work in him. It is not enough to
hold down our head for a day like a bulrush, Esa. 58. 5. This is but a dawbing
up of the breaches God has made in our hearts with untempered mortar (as the
Prophet speaks, Ezekiel. 13. 11.) that had not time enough allowed in the making
and tempering of it; and therefore could not last. 8. Not for any worldly shame
or hurt that his sin already has, or is like to bring upon him, nor for the
fear of Gods wrath only: but chiefly for that he has sinned against, and
offended God, Against thee, thee only have I sinned says David, Psalm. 51. 3.
Therefore true repentance is called repentance toward God, Act. 20. 21.

3. Not every sinner that has left this sin, may be said to have truly
repented: for a man may grow weary of sin in carnal respects, she has
wearied her self with lies, says the Lord, Ezekiel. 24. 12. and sin may have
left him.

But he that, 1. Leaves sin upon a detestation to sin: and a godly sorrow
that he has offended God by it, 2. Cor. 7. 10. 11. 2. Leaves all known
sins as well as some, whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend
(wittingly and willingly) in one point, he is guilty of all, Iam. 2. 10. 3.
Shunneth carefully all shows and appearances of evil, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 22. all
occasions and prouocations to the sin he has left, true repentance has in
it carfulness to shun all prouocations and fear to fall into the same
again, as the Apostle speaks, 2. Cor. 7. 11. And the true penitent will make
a covenant with his eyes, as Job did, Job 31. 1. 4. That hates it in others,
and is careful to draw others from the sin that himself has left, Then
will I teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall be auerted unto thee,
says David, Psalm. 51. 13. Specially those of his own family, and such as he
may most prevail withal, Job 11. 14. Let not wickedness dwell in thy
tabernacles.

The third preservative against this tentation is, the considering of the
danger we have brought that party unto, with whom we have committed this sin.
For, though the Fornicator were sure God would give him grace to repent; yet
must it needs be a great cause of fear, and trouble to his conscience, unless
he be also sure that the party whom he has drawn to this sin, has truly
repented as well as himself. In this respect this sin is worse then either
theft or murder; in those the wrong that is done unto another, may be done
without any hurt or danger to his soul; but so it is not in this sin: In
which respect we know this badge of Gods indignation is set upon Jeroboam often
after his death: Jeroboam that made Israel to sin.

Now the use and end of all this that I have spoken, is not to drive any to
despair, For, 1. Though it be so hard a thing truly to repent, and impossible
to man, yet is God able to give repentance to him that has committed and lived
long in this sin, All things are possible with God, Mat. 19. ^6, 27. 2.
Though few have obtained this grace to repent after they have committed this
sin, yet some have. Yea, some examples God has given us in his Word for it;
as Luke 7. 37. 50 least any humbled sinner should despair. 3. Though God had
never yet given to any this grace, yet is he able to do it now to thee.

But I have thus far urged this point.

1. To persuade such as do offend this way to seek betimes with all
earnestness and importunity for this grace of unfeigned repentance, and not to
grow secure upon hope, that they may have it hereafter when they will.

2. To persuade such as (having heretofore lived in this sin) do now think
they have truly repented; to examine their repentance carefully.

3. To teach and persuade all men, that (whereas Satan uses to draw men to
this, and all other sins by this hope, that they may be able to repent:) this
above all things should terrify and restrain men from sin, that they are
uncertain whether they shall be ever able to repent: yea, that they have so
great causes to fear, that they shall never be able to repent: and that they
know the least sin they commit, will damn them, if they do not repent.

Lecture the nineteenth, July 4. 1609.
IT remains now, that we come to the second use of the former Doctrine.

That forasmuch as fornication, and all uncleanness is proved to be so heinous
and dangerous a sin: we would therefore every one of us hearken unto, and
embrace that exhortation of the Apostle, 1. Cor. 6. 18. Fly fornication: and
2. Tim. 2. 22. Fly also from the lusts of youth. Which is more then if he
should have said, abstain from fornication, abstain from the Lusts of youth.
His meaning is, that no Christian should too far presume of his own strength
in this case, but (to show his detestation of this sin, and care to avoid it)
he should fly as far from it, as he can. So that the exhortation consists
of two branches.

1. That we should shun all shows, and signs, and appearances of this sin.

2. That we should shun all occasions and prouocations to this sin.

No Christian must think it sufficient, to abstain from this sin, but every
one is bound so far to detest it, as to shun all shows and appearance of it,
that may give men occasion to suspect us of it. Tush (will some say) what care
I what men think of me: so long as God and mine own conscience can witness
with me, that I am free from sin? And in this many do maruellously flatter
and deceive themselves. Some that are indeed free from the sin it self, and
some that are guilty of the sin, please themselves in this, that men can
charge them no further then with appearance, and shows of this sin: and what
care they for that? But mark what the Holy Ghost says in this case: 1 Thessalonians.
5. 22. Abstain from all appearance of evil. Exodus 23. 7. Thou shall keep
thee far from a false matter. And the Apostle says, that true repentance
will work in a man a care to clear himself from the sin he had committed,
2. Cor. 7. 11. And whereas they say, they care not what men think of them: It
is certain, that he that cares not what men (specially good men) think of
him, has no true fear of God in him, Proverbs 22. 1. A good name is to be
chosen above great riches; And the Apostle would needs have Titus, and two
other chosen by the Church, to join with him in carrying the benevolence of
the Church of Macedonia to Jerusalem; because he was careful to avoid all
suspicion of dealing ill in that business, 2. Cor. 8. 20. Avoiding this, that
no man should blame us, in this abundance that is ministered by us. Ver. 21.
Providing for honest things, not only before the Lord, but also before men.
And on the contrary, it is noted as a sign of extreme ungraciousness in the
unrighteous Judge, that he neither feared God, nor reverenced men, Luke 18. 2.
So that it is plain every Christian should so hate this sin, as to shun
all signs and shows whereby he may give men occasion to suspect him of it:
or to think he does not much dislike it.

This reprooueth five sorts of men.

First, such as entertain familiarity with such as are infamous for this 1.
sin. Every ones heart and disposition may be known by his company. David
takes comfort in this (as a special note of the uprightness, and innocence of
his heart) That he had not haunted with vain persons, nor kept company with
the wicked, Psalm. 26. 4, 5. And on the contrary, it is made a sign of a wicked
man: Psalm. 50. 18. to be partaker with Adulterers. And Paul wrote to the
Corinthians that they should not keep company with fornicators, 1. Cor. 5. 9.

There be some men so infamous for this sin, that there is none (how honest
soever) whom they are familiar with: but they must needs incur a blot in
their reputation by them. Let none such comfort themselves in their innocence,
for if they did fly fornication, and hate it as they ought they durst not
seek, or desire the familiarity of such persons.

Secondly, Such as haunt suspected houses. Solomon speaks of such a one: Pro.
7. 8, 9. Who passed through the street, by the corner where the 2.
harlot dwelt, and went toward her house in the twilight of the evening, when
the night began to be dark. Lo he haunted a suspected house at a suspicious
time. Therefore he calls him a fool, a youth void of understanding. And
therefore he gives every one counsel: Pro. 5. 8. Keep thy way far from
her, and come not near the door of her house. I deny not but some that use
such houses may be honest, they may have other intents in going to them: but
surely such as haunt them do not fly fornication, nor detest this sin, as
they ought to do.

3. Such as use light, and immodest attire: and setting out of their beauty. It
is a fond, and profane conceit to think it mattereth not how men, and 3.
women go attired, so that their mind be honest: For the Holy Ghost commands
all (specially women) to show modesty and shamefastness even in their attire:
1. Timothy 2. 9. I will that the women attire themselves in comely apparel,
with shamefastness and modesty. And there is a kind of attire, and setting
forth the beauty, which is called an harlots attire (because harlots first
devised it; and do most use it) Proverbs 7. 10. Behold there met him a woman
in an harlots attire (ornatu meritricio, as the word in the original
signifies, and all the best Interpreters read it) And to this the Lord
alludeth: Hosea 2. 2. Let her take away her fornications from her face, (for so
it ought to be read (...)) and her adulteries from between her breasts. How
could there be fornication in her face, and adultery between her breasts?
Truly the meaning is: she wore the badge and cognizance of that sin in those
parts. The laying out, and painting of the breasts is called, the adultery of
the breasts: and the painting of the face (which is noted by the Holy Ghost, 2.
Kings 9. 30. Jeremy 4. 30. to have been the practice of harlots) is called
the fornication of the face. I make no doubt but many that are honest use this
now a days: yet can I not, nor dare I excuse them that use it: but I must
needs say, that though they sin not in fornication, yet they sin in
immodesty. Though they seem to make conscience of this commandment (thou
shall not commit adultery) yet there is another commandment, Fly fornication,
avoid all appearance of evil) which they make no conscience of at all: and
therefore they are guilty of heinous sin.

Such as use filthy talk, and filthy songs. It is strange to see what liberty
many (even some that in many things will seem religious: will pray 4.
daily; and hear devoutly) will give to themselves this way. Though they have
no other exercise of their wit (if their company serve them) but in scurrulous
jests, and filthy communication, no such music in their mirth as amaroas and
filthy songs; yet if they can say they are honest for all this, they think
they are well. These men I would have to observe these things. 1. Filthy words
(whatsoever thou say) do argue a filthy heart: Matthew 15. 18. Those things
which proceed out of the mouth, come from the heart, and they defile the man,
Matthew 12. 34. From the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. Yet have we
many old fornicators (whose bodies are disabled to this sin) that have yet as
bad hearts as ever they had, and show that by the delight they take in speaking
filthily. And yet (silly fools) they slatter themselves in this, that they
have left that sin. 2. Say thy heart were clean, that is not enough: thou
must also make conscience of thy words. The froward mouth do I hate (says the
Lord) Pro. 8. 13. and 18. 21. Death and life are in the power of the tongue,
Matthew. 12. 37. By thy words thou shall be justified, and by thy words thou
shall be condemned, James 1. 26. If any man among you seem to be religious,
and bridle not his tongue, but deceiues his own heart, this man's Religion is
vain. Ephesians. 4, 29. Let not corrupt (rotten) communication come out of your
mouths; And 5. 4. Let no filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, be
once named among you. Mark how jesting ((...)) is joined to filthy talking:
because men are wont to excuse it thus, they speak in jest, they mean no
hurt, we must give them leave to be merry: Such speech (though it be used but
in jest) is condemned. This is one kind of that mirth that Solomon speaks of:
Eccl. 2. 2. I said to laughter thou art mad. Pro. 26. 18. 19. Like mad men they
cast about them firebrands, and deadly things and say they are in sport. 3. Our
tongue of all the members of our body is given of God, to be the principal
instrument, whereby we may glorify God. Therefore it is in the Hebrew Phrase
called our glory. Psalm. 30. 12. Therefore shall my glory praise thee, and not
cease. James 3. 9. Therewith bless we God. That is the cause why the Lord can
worst endure to be dishonored by that member. Therefore Dives is said to have
felt a special torment in his tongue: Luke 16. 24. Send Lazarus that he may
dippe the tippe of his finger in water, and cool my tongue, for I am tormented
in this flame. To conclude; pretend, and glory never so much of thy honesty,
certain it is if thou did fly fornication and hate it as thou ought,
thou durst not accustom thy self to thy filthy talk.

Such as delight in, or can endure filthy talk: such as will provoke filthy
persons to speak filthily; such as will call to the Musicians for the
filthiest 5.
songs they have. For this is a shrewd sign of a filthy heart, specially in
women, because modesty is chiefly required of that sex: it argues an unclean
heart to delight in the lewd speech of others: Pro. 17. 4. A wicked do^ gives
ear to a naughty tongue. 1. Certainly it will grieve, and vex an honest
heart to hear such things. Ephesians. 4. 29, 30. Let no corrupt communication come
out of your mouth, verse. 30. grieve not the holy Spirit of God. It is said of
Lot, his righteous soul was vexed with hearing such things as he heard in
Sodom. 2. Pet. 2. 8. 2. There is a special force in such speech to corrupt
them that hear it. 1. Cor. 15. 33. Be not deceived: evil communications
corrupt good manners. 3. The ear is given of God to another end, that is, to
hear the Word, and to be (sensus disciplinae) that sense whereby knowledge
should be conveyed into the heart: he that has ears to hear (Gods Word he
means) let him hear, says our Savior, Matthew. 11. 15. 4. A good man should
not endure him that uses to bring lies to him, and raise slanders, Psalm 101.
7. He that tells lies shall not tarry in my sight, much less should he
endure them that talk filthily. 5. If any shall object. How can I let lewd men
from speaking lewdely? It is to no purpose to reprove such, they would be the
worse for it. I answer, that if honest men would show that dislike as they
might, they would not be much troubled with such varlets. That which Solomon
says in another case (Pro. 25. 23. An angry countenance drives away a
backebiting tongue) would hold in this also. They might even with a countenance
restrain, or chase them away. And that which he speaks, Pro. 20. 8. Is not
true of Kings, and great men only (though in them principally) but of all
Christians; They may scatter away evil, and lewdenesse, even with their eyes,
and countenance.

Lecture the twentieth, July 11. 1609.
IT remains now, that we come to the second branch of the Apostles
Exhortation, of which we have already heard: and that is this. We are bound
(out of a holy fear, least we should at any time fall into this sin, and out
of that detestation we should bear unto it) to shun all occasions, and
prouocations that might draw us to it; and to use all good means that may be
to preserve us from it. True it is that it is God only that preserues any of
us from this or any other sin. Psalm 18. 35. Thy right hand has stayed me;
and 56. 13. Thou have kept my feet from falling. But the means whereby he does
it, is by working in us a fear of falling, which makes us carefully to shun
tentations. See how this fear is commended to us in Gods Word, as a wise man
fears and departs from evil, Pro. 14. 16. And blessed is the man that
fears always, Pro. 28. 14. and work out your own salvation with fear and
trembling, Phil. 2. 12. 2. An endeavor to use all means that may preserve,
and strengthen us from falling. I kept my self (says David, Psalm. 18. 23.)
from mine iniquity: and 1. John 5. 18. He that is begotten of God keeps
himself, and that wicked one touches him not. There is none so strong or full
of grace, but he may fall into the most fearful sins that are, if he be not
careful to shun temptation: and to use the means God has appointed to
preserve him from sin. Therefore Christ charge his Disciples both to watch
and to pray against temptation: Matthew. 26. 41. And Esaias 33. 15. It is made the
note of a man that has a sound heart, and may have boldness with God, that he
stops his ear from hearing of blood (that is, from hearing of that that might
provoke him to shed blood) and shuts his eyes from seeing of evil. The
Apostle gives no hope to any Christian that he shall be able to resist in the
evil day, and to stand fast to the end; unless he take to him the whole
armor of God, Ephesians. 6. 13.

There is not the best man that you know, but he would prove as bad as the
worst man you know, if he should keep such company as he does: and neglect the
means of grace as he does. I do not say, that every one that has tentations
to sin, must needs be a wicked man.

There be some places and conditions of life that God has called men unto,
wherein they have fewer means of grace, and stronger tentations to evil, then
they should have in other callings. Now the faithful have a promise from God
to preserve them from such tentations as are incident to their lawful calling,
and which they cannot avoid, unless they would forsake their calling, Psalm.
91. 11, 12. He shall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all
thy ways (seem they never so dangerous, and full of tentation) they shall
bear thee in their hands, that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone. Pro.
10. 29. The way of the Lord is strength to the upright man. The man whose heart
is upright shall find strength enough against every tentation, while he is in
the Lords way, 2. Chron. 15. 3. While we are with him, he will be with us,
we may be sure. This is the reason why Joseph continued so religious and
chaste, even in Putiphars house, Genesis 39. 10. And Obadiah in Ahabs house, 1.
King. 18. 3. And diverse of Neroes household servants were the most zealous
Christians that were in all Rome, Phil. 4. 22. Therefore the Apostle charge
Christian women and servants that they should not forsake their husbands and
masters that were Infidells, 1. Cor. 7. 13. 21. All these (doubtless) had
slender means of grace, and strong tentations to evil, and yet they were not
corrupted. Why so? Because they did not wittingly neglect any means of grace,
neither did they willingly run into tentation, but shunned them, and avoided
them as much as they were able without forsaking their callings: and because
they were in Gods way, they were under his protection. But on the contrary,
such as wittingly (presuming on their own streugth) do run into tentation,
and neglect the means God has appointed to preserve them: such are out of
Gods protection, and can have no assurance to be preserved, but it is just with
God to leave such to themselves, that they may fall into most fearful sins.
See two notable examples of this. Solomon presumed he was too wise and learned,
to be corrupted in Religion by any of his wives: he would be abled to convert
them rather, and make good women of them: but see how God forsook him, and how
strangely he fell: 1. King. 11. 4. His wives turned his heart after other gods.
Peter presumed he had that love to Christ, as though all men should be offended
at him, yet would he never be offended, Matthew. 26. 33. In so much as though
Christ foretold him that he would deny him thrice, he could not believe it,
verse 33. Though I should die with thee, yet would I not deny thee, In this
presumption of his he ran into tentation, verse 58. He went into the High
Priests hall, and sat there with his servants: but see how God left him to
himself, and how fearfully he fell, verse. 72. 74. It is certain then that
they that (presuming on their own strength) dare venture upon any tentation to
uncleanness, use not the means that God has prescribed to preserve men from
it: they do not fear this sin, they do not hate it as they ought to do.

If any desire to know what be the tentations and prouocations to this sin,
that we must shun, and what be the means we must use to preserve us from it.

I answer, that I find in the Word seven special things prescribed to them
that desire to keep themselves from this sin.

1. He that would keep himself from this sin, must shun all wantonness
and dalliance: yea all chambering and secret familiarity with women. This is
forbidden (as a work of darkness and dishonesty by Gods express
commandment, Romans 13. 13. Let us walk honestly as in the day, not in
chambering and wantonness. Many are wont to say, may not a man do so much,
and yet be honest enough. I beseech you mark the words well, and consider they
are not my words, but the Holy Ghosts. When Abimelech saw Isaac in a secret
place sporting with Rebecca, he concluded from thence, certainly, She is thy
wife, Genesis 26. 8, 9. He knew that such a one as Isaac durst not have used such
familiarity with another woman, no not with his sister. It is said of Joseph
that he shunned the company of Putiphars wife, he would not be with her alone,
Genesis 39. 10. This is a strange preciseness (will some say.) Well, let him that
is sure he has more strength then Joseph had, give himself more liberty in
this case then Joseph durst do. But you know the Proverb, who is so bold as
blind Bayard? who so venterous as he that has least strength? and because most
men and women are so confident that this may be done without hurt, I beseech
you mark what the Holy Ghost (who knew what the force of this tentation is,
and what our strength is better then any of us does) speaks of this matter,
Pro. 6. 29. He that goes in to his neighbors wife, shall not be innocent,
whosoever touches her. Why what hurt is there in going into her chamber,
sitting with her in secret, touching her? He shall not be innocent says the
Holy Ghost: yea, it is as impossible (says he) for any to do this, and not to
receive hurt by it; as it is for one to carry fire in his bosom, or to go
barefoot on hot coals, and not be burnt, Pro. 6. 27, 28.

2. He that would keep himself from this sin, must take heed to his eye, and
not give it too much liberty to look on every thing that it desires to behold
that which he knows will, or may set his heart on fire. When a City is
besieged by an enemy, the chief care is to look to the gates, and to fortify
the walls, because he is with much more ease and safety resisted while he is
without, then he can be when he is entered into the City. The gate whereat
usually this enemy of ours, lust, seeks to enter, is the eye. Nothing does
more kindle this fire, then the beholding of unclean pictures, reading of idle
books, setting the eye upon the beauty of wanton women. The Apostle describing
unclean persons, says, They have eyes full of adultery, and that could not
cease to sin, 2. Pet. 2. 14. He that has an unclean eye, that gives liberty
to his wanton eye, cannot cease to sin. And Solomon makes it a chief cause of
all the outrageous lusts of youth, that they walk after the sight of their
eyes, Eccl. 11. 9. And it is noted in the Gospel, that the beholding of
Herodias daughter when she danced, did so strongly inchant, and bewitch the
unclean heart of incestuous Herod, that (like a madman) he had her ask what
she would and he would give it her: and not contenting himself so, he did
swear to her, that whatsoever she should ask, he would give it her, even to
the half of his kingdom, Mar. 6. 22. I will not take upon me to say, that all
dancing is unlawful: but this I will boldly say, that that kind of dancing
that is now in use, is now, and ever has been a strong provocation to this
sin. If I should relate unto you, what many of the ancient Fathers have spoken
and written of it, you would not think (as many of you are apt to do) that
none but foolish Precisians do mislike it; but you would rather wonder (as I
my self have often done) to see many Divines, who seem to be the greatest
admirers of the Fathers (who were indeed holy and reverend men: worthy for
their piety and learning, of great esteem in the Church of God) show so little
zeal and detestation against this heathenish custom. To conclude this point
we read of Job, that by reason of the danger that he knew was in the eye to
corrupt the heart, he made a covenant with his eye, and bound it to the good
behavior, Job 31. 1. Let him that is sure he has more strength of grace in
him then Job had, give liberty to his eye to read what he lists, and behold
what he lists: but if he have no more strength then Job had, let him take heed
how he does it.

3. He that would keep himself from this sin, must make conscience of, and
restrain his thoughts: he may not take pleasure in, nor seek to nourish
unclean thoughts in his heart. When Job had said he had made a covenant with
his eyes, he adds: Why then should I think of a maid? Why should I give
liberty to such thoughts, Job 31. 1. For, 1. All uncleanness begins there,
Matthew. 15. 18, 19. Those things that proceed out of the mouth of man come from
the heart, and they defile a man. For out of the heart come evil thoughts,
murders, adulteries, fornications, etc. Therefore when Solomon would give a
Preservative against this sin, he says, Pro. 6. 25. Desire not her beauty in
thy heart. 2. No man can be sure he shall stay himself there: but from his
mental, and contemplative fornication, he will be in great danger to fall unto
that which is actual, Iam. 1. 15. Lust when it has conceived brings forth
sin, Pro. 14. 22. Do not they err that imagine evil.

3. If a man could stay himself there (though among men he might be esteemed
honest yet) God counts him a filthy wretch. He sees and abhors, and judges
these unclean thoughts, and lusts of the heart, Pro. 15. 26. The thoughts of
the wicked are abominable to the Lord. And Matthew. 5. 28. I say unto you, that
whosoever looks on a woman, and lusts after her, has committed adultery
with her already in his heart.

4. He that would keep himself from uncleanness, must use the comforts of
this life (meat, and drink I mean) soberly, and moderately: and not pamper
the flesh too much. Among the causes of the Sodomites beastly lust, fullness of
bread is named: Ezekiel. 16. 49. And when Solomon had said, Woe to them that
tarry long at the wine, to them that go, and seek mixtwine (no drink is
strong enough for them) Prou. 23. 30. He gives this for a reason, verse 33.
thine eyes shall look upon strange women (though thou have a wife of thine
own) and thine heart shall speak lewd things. True it is that God has given
us liberty to use his good creatures, not only for our necessity, but
liberally, and for our delight also. The Lord allowed, and commanded his people
three times of the year, in public profession of their thankefullnesse, for
certain excellent and public benefits he had bestowed on them, to meet
together: and at such meetings to keep a feast seven days together: Deuteronomy. 16.
15. And in this feast they might eat of the best, and drink of the best, and
please their appetite: Deuteronomy. 14. 26. Thou shall bestow thy money for whatsoever
thy heart desires, whether it be ox, or sheep, or wine, or strong drink,
or whatsoever thy heart desires. And though Christ's friends that were married
in Cana were not very rich, yet had they a feast at their wedding, and wine and
such like extraordinary fare: yea our Savior was not only present at the
feast, but miraculously provided them great plenty of wine: and though the
feast was almost done; and they had drunk well before, John 2. 6. 10. But
though this be so, yet is it not lawful for any man to use these creatures of
God so liberally every day: the Apostle says, they are as bruit beasts led
with sensuality, and made to be taken and destroyed, that count it a pleasure
to live deliciously every day (so it is to be translated) 2. Pet. 2. 12, 13.
And our Savior notes it to the shame of Dives, (though he were a rich man)
that he fared well and delicately every day: Luke 16. 19. And Eccl. 10. 17.
Blessed art thou (O Lord) when thy Princes eat in time, for strength, and not
for drunkenness. And it is noted, Matthew. 24. 28. as a sin in the old world,
that they were ((...)) given to eating. Now if this be unlawful for any, then
much more for such, whose calling, and condition binds them to lead a single
life. If such give themselves to such excess: and their ordinary diet will not
content them (though it be good and plentiful) but they must go every day to
the tavern, or to the alehouse: these men proclaim to the world, that they
fear not this sin. To conclude this point, mark what the Apostle James says
of these men: James 5. 5. Ye have lived in pleasure and in wantonness. But
how proves he them wantons? Ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of
sacrifice or feasting. They that keep feasts so often, must needs be wantons.

5. He that would keep himself from uncleanness, must take heed of
idleness, and sluggishnesse. Among the causes of the Sodomites sin, this is
reckoned by the Prophet for one, Ezekiel. 16. 49. Yea the Holy Ghost speaks of
these as of the causes of David's fall: he grew idle and neglected his calling.
At the time of the year when Princes go forth to battle, he sent Ioab and
tarried at home himself, 2. Sam. 11. 2. And he gave himself too much to
sleep, 2. Sam. 11. 2. When it was toward evening, he rose from his bed, and
walked on the roof of his house. Idleness is dangerous for any man, and will
breed much corruption in the heart: as the land untilled will grow full of
weeds, and the standing poole full of filthy and noisome things. That made
Solomon speak thus of the idle person, Pro. 6. 14. Lewd things are in his
heart, he imagines evil at all times.

But especially it is dangerous for such, as whose condition and estate forces
them to lead a single life. The Apostle having spoken. 1. Tim. 5. 11. of
wanton young widows, verse 13. He notes this a cause of their wantonness
that they were idle, and went about from house to house as they that had
nothing to do.

To conclude this point; if any single person can fare plentifully, and live
idly, never doing any work, never taking any book in hand, seldom rising
before ten a clock: and yet keep himself chaste in body and mind. I dare
be bold to say he has more strength in him then ever David had.

6. He that would keep himself from uncleanness, must exercise himself in
the duties of piety with an upright heart. When the Apostle had said, 1 Timothy 4.
7. Exercise thy self unto godliness. He adds a reason, verse 8. Godliness is
profitable unto all things. And if for all things then will it preserve a man
from this tentation also. This we shall find prescribed by the wisdom of
God, Pro. 23. 26, 27. My son give me thy heart, and let thine eyes observe my
ways. For a whore is a deep ditch, and a strange woman is a narrow pit. The
Word of God if a man exercise himself in it; and hear, and read, and
meditate in it with an honest heart, has this virtue in it to preserve a man
from this sin, Pro. 6. 23. 24. The commandment is a lantern, and
instruction a light, corrections for instruction are the way of life. But how
proves he that, verse 24. To keep thee from the wicked woman. And Pro. 2. 10.
11. When wisdom enters into thy heart, and knowledge delights thy soul,
then shall counsel preserve thee, and understanding shall keep thee. And
verse. 16. It shall deliver thee from the strange woman. If any man shall
object, that there are many that have professed Religion, that yet are known
to have lived in this sin. I answer. That such were hypocrites, and professed
Religion with an irreligious heart, Eccl. 7. 28. He that is good before God,
shall be delivered from her: but the sinner shall be taken by her. And on the
other side, he that despises Religion, let him use never so many means to
keep himself chaste, yet can he have no assurance to be preserved from this
sin. Because God has threatened to punish the contempt of Religion in men, by
giving them up to this sin: Romans 1. 28. As they liked not to retain God in
their knowledge, he gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things
that are not convenient: being filled with all unrighteousness, fornications,
etc.

Now as all men that desire to keep themselves free from this sin, had need
to pray much, to hear, and read the word much: so specially such young men as
by their condition, and estate of life, are enforced to lead a single life:
Psalm 119. 9. Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed
thereto according to thy word. So that if such single persons as do fare
plentifully, live idly, seldom, or never pray; seldom or never hear, or read
the Word, yea despise, and hate piety; should keep themselves chaste, it were
one of the greatest wonders, that ever God wrought.

7. He that would keep himself from uncleanness, must not despise or
wilfully neglect the benefit of lawful marriage. True it is: all are not
bound to marry. For, 1. Such as God has given the gift of continency unto, may
use that gift, and live single, all men cannot receive this saying (says our
Savior, Matthew. 19. 11.) save they to whom it is given, and verse 12. He that
is able to receive it, let him receive it. 2. All such are bound to seek of
God, and use all means to obtain that gift: as (by reason of their outward
estate) cannot see how they shall be able to live in wedlock, without much
trouble, and distraction, I would that all men were even as I my self says
the Apostle, 1. Cor. 7. 7. and verse 26. I suppose that this is good for the
present distress, I say that it is good for a man so to be, that is, to be
single and unmarried. 3. There is no faithful man, whom the Lord has by
necessity restrained, and withheld from the benefit of marriage (as the child
that cannot obtain consent of parents; the married persons who by sickness,
or necessary absence are separated for a time) but if by all good means with
an honest heart he seek it of God, he may be assured to obtain this gift.
For that grace without which they cannot choose but live in sin, the faithful
may be assured (by virtue of that promise, Luke 11. 13. If you being evil know
how to give gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly father
give his holy spirit to them that ask him.) to obtain if they seek it.

But the person whom the Lord has not thus restrained from marriage, if he
cannot by the use of all good means, obtain the gift of continency, is bound
to marry, to avoid f^rnication let every man have his own wife, and let every
woman have her own husband; says the Apostle, 1. Cor. 7. 2. Yea, and say he
could contain himself from any filthy act, if he cannot contain from inward
burning, he is bound to marry, if they cannot contain let them marry, it is
better to marry then to burn, says he, 1. Cor. 7. 9. For this is the chief
means ordained of God to preserve men from this sin. Yea, this is now the
chief end, and use of this ordinance of God (though at the first institution
before the flood, propagation of the Church, and mutual help, and comfort was
the chief end: Wherefore did God at the first ordain marriage, and made for
Adam but one Woman? because he sought a godly seed says the Prophet, Mal. 2.
15. And the Lord said (in the first institution of wedlock, Genesis 2. 18.) it is
not good for man to be alone, I will make him an help meet for him. To
preserve us from uncleanness, to avoid fornication, let every man have his
own wife, etc. says the Apostle, 1. Cor. 7. 2. Neither is it possible for any
that wants the gift of continency, to keep himself chaste, if he do wilfully
neglect marriage, either for that he judges that estate less holy then the
single life, or more chargeable, and more subject to trouble: Nay, though he
do marry if he be not therein careful to marry with such a one as he can find
in his heart to love, and delight in above any other, he shall never be able to
keep himself cha^t, rejoice with the wife of thy youth; let her be as the
loving Hind and pleasant Roe: let her breasts satisfy thee at all times, and
be thou ravished always with her love. And why will thou my son be ravished
with a strange woman, and embrace the b^some of a stranger, says the wisdom
of God: you see it is not so much the having of a wife, as the having of her
and delighting in her, that is the means that God has sanctified to preserve
a man from whoredom, Pro. 5. 18, 19, 20. And that is the chief cause, why the
Popish Clergy (through the just judgment of God) does so abound in all
unnatural uncleanness because they do not only forbear marriage, but
bind themselves by vow against it, and condemn it in their doctrine, and both
think and speak dishonourably of it.

Lecture the One and twenty, August 8. 1609.
WE have often heard, that these words from the 16. verse to the 18. do offer
unto our consideration four principal points.

1. That our Savior thirsting after the salvation of this poor Woman,
discovers unto her her sin; and nothing he had said before to her could work
upon her conscience, till he took this course with her.

2. That the sin he discovers to her, was a secret sin unknown to all
men.

3. That among all the secret or open sins which he knew by her, when he
would touch and awaken her conscience, he makes choice of the Fornication she
lived in, and charge her only with that.

4. That though he knew she lived in so heinous a sin, he reiects her not for
all that.

The three first points we have already spoken of, it remains now that we
come to the last, though he knew she lived in so heinous a sin, he reiects
her not for it.

From whence (that we may the better receive that comfortable instruction which
the Holy Ghost intends to give us in this example.) Let us consider 1. What a
manner of person this Woman was. 2. The gracious respect Christ had unto her.
She was 1. An Idolater: and what sin is more odious to God then Idolatry? 2.
She was an Idolater of that nation, which of all others was most odious to Gods
people. Among them it was the most odious term of reproach to call one a
Samaritan, John 8. 48. 3. She was a filthy harlot. And yet see how Christ
respected her, 1. He seeks her conversion. 2. He bears, with her
blockishnesse, and frowardness in rejecting that offer of grace he made unto
her; and gives her not over for that. 3. When he saw there was no way to do
her good, but by charging her conscience with the sin she lived in, he does it
most gently and lovingly, for fear of discouraging of her: he called her not
harlot, but only intimates to her that he knew how she lived; and that in
most secret manner also, while his Disciples were away, and no body by, but
they two only. Now then the Doctrine that we learn from hence, is this:

That the sins of Gods Elect, how many, or how heinous soever they be, cannot
hinder their salvation, nor separate them from the love of God, after Doct. 4.
they once repent of them.

Before I confirm this unto you, three things are to be promised to prevent
the mistaking of this Doctrine.

1. It is certain God hates all sin, in all men, as well in the Elect as in
the Reprobate, with a perfect and infinite hatred, above that that any tongue
can express, or heart conceive of, Hab. 1. 13. Thou art of pure eyes, and
can not see evil, thou can not behold wickedness.

2. If any of Gods own people fall into gross and scandalous sins, he is
wont to correct, and scourge them shapely for them. David may be an example of
this, 2. Sam. 12. 10, 11.

3. He is wont to bear less with his own people in this life, then he does
with the wicked: and to correct them for such small faults, as he uses to
pass over in the ungodly: Amos 3. 2. You only have I known of all the
families of the earth, therefore will I visit you for all your iniquities.
Moses did but omit, and delay the circumcision of his child, and the Lord met
him, and would have slain him for it, Exodus 4. 24.

Yet can no sin of Gods Elect how heinous soever, cause God to hate or reject
them: though he hate sin in them, he cannot hate them for sin: though he
correct, and scourge them for sin, yet he cannot hate them for sin: but
notwithstanding their sins be never so many, never so heinous, he loves them
never the less with the love of a father, with a most tender, and unspeakable
love.

The truth of this Doctrine may appear unto us, in four principal points.

2. He is never a whit the more unwilling to offer his grace unto them, and to
seek their conversion, for any heinous sin they lived in before their
calling.

2. He thinks never a whit the worse of them for that they have been, or for
any sins they have lived in before their conversion, after once they have
repented of them.

3. He likes never the worse of the good works, done by them after their
conversion, because of the corruption that is mingled with them.

4. He makes their very sins turn to their good, and to the furtherance of
their salvation.

Of these four point I will speak in order, as briefly as I can.

For the first. Man's reason can conceive cause why God should have some 1.
respect unto us after our conversion: but that he should regard us so far as
to seek our salvation, with such endeavor, care and patience, when we were
utterly without grace, children of wrath, enemies to all goodness, specially
so notorious sinners as many of us were, this argues a special, and
wonderful love indeed: and yet so he did. What a one was Paul? one that
breathed out threatenings and slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord, Acts
9. 1. one that was not a blasphemer and threatner himself and injurious, that
is, such a one as cared not what wrong he did the faithful, though he had no
color of right or law for that he did against them, 1. Tim. 1. 13. But one
that did also counsel others to blaspheme the name of Christ against their own
knowledge and consciences, Acts 26. 11. And what were those whom Christ showed
most kindness unto, most care to win? Surely the most notorious, and
infamous sinners, that lived in the world. See this here in the example of this
woman: see it also in another woman, an infamous and notorious sinner, Luke 7.
39. see it, Matthew. 9. 10. Many Publicans and Sinners came and sat down with
him at Matthewes feast. Insomuch as lewd hypocrites took great offense at
this: Matthew. 9. 11. and 11. 19. Luke 7. 39. and 15. 2. Of this the Lord
speaks: Esaias 65. 1, 2. I said behold me, behold me, to a nation that called
not upon my name, I have spread out my hands all the day, unto a rebellious
people, which walked in a way that was not good. And Ezekiel. 16. 6. When I passed
by thee, I saw thee polluted in thine own blood, and I said unto thee when
thou wast in thy blood, thou shall live, even when thou wast in thy blood, I
said unto thee, thou shall live.

Secondly, the Lord thinks never the worse of any for that they have been,
for any sins that they have lived in, when once they have repented of 2.
them. Ezekiel. 18. 21, 22. If the wicked will return from all his sins that he
has committed: and keep all my statutes. All his transgressions that he has
committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him. And Ier. 31. 34. I will
forgive their iniquity, and will remember their sins no more. But as the Lord
does joy more in one that has been a notorious sinner, after once he has
repented, then in many others, as our Savior teaches us both in the Parable
of the lost sheep, Luke 15. 45. and of the lost piece of money, verse. 8, 9. and
of the lost child, ver. 32. and in plain terms, verse. 7. so he is wont to
show himself, more kind, and loving to such ever after, then to any other of
his people. Observe this in the History of the Gospel, that our Savior never
showed so much kindness to any, as to such as had been the most notorious
sinners. He bids himself to Zacheus house: Luke 19. 5. He accepts of a strange
kindness from a woman that had been a notorious sinner; He lets her come
behind him as he was sitting at table; and wash his feeet with her tears; and
2. wipe them with the hairs of her head; and 3. kiss them; and 4. anoint
them, Luke 7. 38, 39. The first of all that he appeared unto after his
resurrection was Mary Magdalen: Mar. 16. 9. He loved Peter never the less for
denying, and forswearing him, after he had repenced, but showed more kindness
to him, then to any of the Apostles beside: to him he appeared after his resur
rection, before he appeared to any of the rest: 1. Cor. 15. 5. and when he did
appear to him, in stead of vpbraiding him with his heinous sin, he comforts
him, and renewes his calling to the Apostle-ship, John 21. 15. And whereas (a
thing worthy to be marked) there be but* four women mentioned in the pedigree
of our Savior, Matthew. 1. there is never a one of these four upon whom the
Scripture has no: set a mark of infamy for notorious sin. The first was
Tamar, Matthew. 1. 3. with whom Judah her father in law had committed incest, Genesis
38 18. The second Rahab, Matthew. 1. 5. and she was a common strumpet, Heb. 11.
31. The third was Ruth, Mat. 1. 5. and she came of Moab, whom Lot begot of his
own daughter, Genesis 19. 37. The fourth Vriahs wife, Matthew. 1. 6. whom David had
committed adultery with: and for whom he was so plagued of God: 2. Sam. 12. 9,
10. This I say is worthy to be observed, the rather because, 1. It is not
usual with the Holy Ghost to mention women in the Genealogies. 2. No woman in
this Genealogy is mentioned but these. 3. No one unfaithful or wicked man is
mentioned in his legal genealogy by Joseph. Luke 3. but in this his natural
genealogy only. 4. No reason can be given, nor use imagined of mentioning these
four (specially of three of them) but only to teach us this, that poor
penitent sinners shall have never the less honor with God, shall be never the
worse esteemed, for that which they have done, after they have once truly
repented, and turned to God. And thus have we seen that the Lord likes never
the worse of any of his elect, for the sins they lived in before their
conversion. Now let us come to the two last points I propounded to you.

Thirdly, Whereas after our conversion the best works we do are imperfect, 3.
and stained with many corruptions, insomuch as the Prophet says in the name
of the true Church: Esaias 64. 6. We are all as an unclean thing, and all our
righteousnesses are as filthy rags. So that if the Lord should mark the
iniquities of his children, they cannot stand: Psalm. 130. 3. Yet does he not
reject, nor abhor them for these stains; But 1. Accepts them never the
less, and takes them in good part, our spiritual sacrifices are acceptable to
God through Christ, 1. Pet. 2. 5. 2. Delights and takes pleasure in them, Cant.
2. 14. Show me thy sight, let me hear thy voice, for thy voice is sweet, and
thy sight is comely. 3. He will reward them also, and that with the reward of
the inheritance, Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of
inheritance says the Apostle, even to the poorest servant that of conscience
toward God should perform to their Masters that were but infidels, Col. 3.
24. 4. He will not so much as take notice of, or see many of these blemishes,
that are in our best works. But even as we stand affected to our own children
whom we love dearly, there is many a blemish which in another man's eye is a
great deformity (as a mole in the face, or pockholes, or a squint eye) which to
us seems none at all, because love blinds us: so is it with the Lord, such
is his love to his children that Number. 23. 21. He secth no iniquity in Jacob,
nor any transgression in Israel, but Mic. 7. 18. Passes by the transgression
of the remnant of his heritage: which makes the Prophet in the beginning of
that verse in admiration to cry, Who is a God like to thee?

Fourthly, he is so far from rejecting his Elect for their sins, that 4.
he (like a most skillfull Physician that can make an Antidote, and sovereign
medicine of the most deadly poison in the world) makes the very sins of his
Elect, to turn to the furtherance of their salvation, according to that which
the Apostle speaks, Romans 8. 28. This we shall see in three points.

1. The greatest sinner is sooner brought to the sense of his misery, and of
the need he has of Christ, to hunger and thirst after Christ: then he that
has lived a more civil life, Matthew. 21. 31. The Publicans and Harlots went
into the Kingdom of God, and repented before the righteous Pharisees.

2. The greater that a man's sins have been before his conversion, the
greater will his love be to God, and care to please him after his conversion.
Luke 7. 47. she loved much because many sins had been forgiven her.

3. The great corruptions the godly find in themselves, keep them from being
proud in themselves, and from despising of others. And so the Apostle says, of
that thorn in his own flesh that he complained so much of, 2. Cor. 12. 7. So
that we may truly say, that though we our selves are bound to account the
corruption that remains in us an intolerable burden which we must be
continually humbled for, and groan under and strive to lessen and desire to be
eased of as the Apostle did, Romans 7. 24. because our most holy and heavenly
Father is grieved and offended by it; and because it is ever budding and
bringing forth in us such fruits as are most bitter unto us and breed us much
woe; yet the infinite wisdom, and power, and goodness of our God, makes
this a great benefit to us that we are not in this life perfectly regenerated,
but that the Lord suffers sin to dwell in us, so long as we abide in this
tabernacle.

If any man shall demand of me the reasons of this Doctrine: the cause Reason.
why the Lord should thus love his Elect, and be so partial toward them: that
though he hates sin in all, and hates the Reprobate, and damnes them for
their sin, yet he hates not his Elect for their sins, but loves them even
before there is any grace in them at all, even before they have repented of
their sins, I can give no other reason of it, but his own good will and
pleasure only, he has mercy on whom he will have merry, says the Apostle,
Romans 9. 18. and Ephesians. 1. 11. He works all things after the counsel of his
own will. And in this it becomes every mortal man to rest without inquiry
any further, and to say with the holy Apostle, Romans 9. 21, 22. Has not the
Potter power over the clay? What if God will do thus.

2. The respect God has to the Son of his love to whom he gave them before
the world was, He has chosen us in him (says the Apostle, Ephesians. 1. 4.)
before the foundation of the world, and verse 6. He has made us accepted in
his beloved.

Now of this Doctrine I may say as the Prophet does in another case, Esaias 28.
9. To whom shall we teach this Doctrine? Who is fit to hear and Use.
receive it? The Apostle speaks of some that stumble at the Word, 1. Pet. 2.
8. and such there have ever been in the Church. But there is no part of the
Word, no truth of God, that so many do stumble at, as at this Doctrine of the
infinite mercy of God unto sinners. For where shall we find a man (almost)
that does not abuse this Doctrine, to the encouraging of himself to sin: and
to the hardening of his heart against all check of conscience for sin? yet
must this doctrine (so clearly and plentifully delivered in the holy
Scripture, and tending so much to the comfort of Gods people) be taught, though
there be never so many wicked men that will take hurt by it. The childrens
bread must not be kept from them, because of the dogs that will be ready to
snatch it out of our hands when we break it to them. Yet before I give the
children their bread, and apply this Doctrine to them, unto whom it only
belongs, I will endeavor to drive away the dogs, by showing that the
profane and impenitent sinner, that turns Gods grace into wantonness, and
encourages himself to sin by the knowledge of Gods mercy, has nothing to
do with this Doctrine, nor any cause at all to take comfort in it.

For 1. All this that is spoken in the Word, of Gods mercy, belongs only to
the Elect, which are therefore called Uessels of mercy, not to the Reprobates 1.
which are called Vessels of wrath, Romans 9. 22. 23.

If thou say I may be one of Gods Elect too. I answer thou may indeed, but
till thou know thy self to be so, and can find the marks of Election in
thy self, thou can take no comfort in this Doctrine. Therefore every where
in Scripture this mercy of God is restrained to them that fear him: the
Scripture every where teaches, that none else have cause to glory in it, or
trust to it, Psalm. 118. 4. Let them that fear the Lord now say, that his mercy
endures for ever. And 115. 11. Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord.

2. This is noted by the Holy Ghost to be a fearful sign of reprobation, and
that thou shall never taste of Gods mercy; because thou stumblest, and 2.
take occasion of being more wicked, even from the pure and holy Word of God,
and from the doctrine of his mercy, 1. Pet. 2. 8.

3. This God (whose mercy thou so much gloryest in, and the doctrine of whose
mercy thou do so much abuse) and Christ Jesus (through whom 3.
thou trustest to find him so merciful) will appear unto thee one day so
terrible, as thou shall cry to the hills and rocks to fall upon thee to hide
thee from his presence, Apoc. 6. 15, 16. Yea this shall increase thy horror at
that day, that thou have sinned against so merciful a God; and when thou shall
discern that he that is so infinite in mercy toward others, yea (happily) toward
such as were more notorious sinners then thy self, has no mercy for thee at
all, Luke 13. 28. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall
see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God,
and you your selves thrust out.

But to let them pass, and to apply this Doctrine to such, as to whom indeed
it only belongs.

First it serves for the unspeakable comfort of all such as can find in
themselves the assured tokens that they are the Elect of God. And indeed 1.
this Doctrine is to such the foundation of all true comfort. If thy sin
cannot hurt thee, nothing can hurt thee, neither prosperity, nor adversity,
life, nor death, the world, nor the devil. For as sin is the sting of death,
1. Cor. 15. 56. So is it of every other thing that thou have cause to fear.
Now if thou be Gods Elect, thou may be thus secure, that (though thy sins
may make thee subject to many a correction and scourge in this life, yet) shall
they never be able to separate thee from the love of God, or hinder thy
eternal happiness. Every man therefore that desires to enjoy this comfort,
must labor to make his election certain to himself: and that shall he do by
making his effectual calling certain to himself: 2. Pet. 1. 10. And this is
an argument of an effectual calling, when he finds that through Gods grace
he is able unfeignedly to repent of all his sins, that is, so to grieve for
offending God by them, that he can hate, and forsake them. For this grace of
unfeigned repentance is given to none but them that are of the Israel of God,
the Elect of God, Acts 5. 31. And the departing from iniquity is made a
certain note of Election, 2. Timothy 2. 19. So that if thou find thy self
able through Gods grace to repent of thy sins, there is no cause thou
should fear damnation for thy sins, or the loss of Gods favor. For if
notwithstanding the gross sins thou liuedst in before thy calling, when there
was in thee no grace at all, nor love to God, he then loved thee so far forth
as to give thee his Word, to offer his Son to thee, to give thee his spirit:
how can thou doubt but he will much more love thee, and not cast thee off for
thy sins, now he has given thee a heart to love and fear his name?

Secondly, this Doctrine serves for our instruction and imitation that
profess our selves to be the children of God: we should be followers of God 2.
in this as dear children, Ephesians. 5. 1.

1. As the heinous sins of his Elect do not hinder God from seeking their
calling and conversion: so we should not be discouraged from endeavoring with
all long sufferance, by all means (especially by prayer unto God) the
conversion of such as are yet without grace, be they never so wicked, specially
such of them as God has tied us unto by any special bond: when the Apostle
had charged Timothy to take principal care of this, that in the Church
assemblies prayers of all sorts may be made for Kings and all in authority
(whereof at that time there few or none that professed or favored the truth)
1. Tim. 2. 1, 2. he tells him, verse. 3. that this is good and acceptable in the
sight of God our Savior; and gives this for the reason of it, verse. 4. because
he will have all men (of all sorts and conditions of men some) to be saved and
to come unto the knowledge of the truth. And 2. Tim. 2. 24, 25. he says the
servant (and minister of the Lord) must be gentle unto all men, apt to teach,
patient instructing with meekness even them that oppose themselves. And Tit.
3. 2, 3. he requires of all the faithful that in their whole conversation they
show all meekness to all men, considering how bad themselves (even the best
of them) were before their conversion.

2. As the Lord loves no man the worse for that he has been, after once he
has unfeignedly repented: no more should we. See this in the Apostles charge
concerning the incestuous person, Ye ought (says he) to forgive him and
comfort him, lest peradventure such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch
sorrow. Wherefore I beseech you that you would confirm your love toward him,
2. Cor. 2. 7, 8.

3. As the infirmities of Gods children do not cause the Lord to despise them,
or dislike their good works: no more should the infirmities we discern in
them that fear God, cause us to despise them, or minish that reverence, and
love that we owe unto them, Despise not any of Christ's little ones, Matthew. 18.
10. Honor all that fear God, Psalm. 15. 4.

THE TWO AND TWENTIETH LECTVRE, ON AUGUST, XV. MDCIX.
IOH. IIII. XIX, XX. The Woman says unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a
Prophet.

Our Fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the
place where men ought to worship.


We have heard that in the former verses, our Savior seeking the conversion
of this poor woman, and finding she could not, or would not understand what he
had said unto her in the commendation of the water of life which he had to
bestow upon her, discovers to her the secret whoredom that she lived in. Now
in these words the Evangelist sets down the effect, which this reproof did
take in her heart, and how the grace of true conversion did now begin to work
and show it self in her. And this he notes in three singular effects, and
fruits of grace that did appear in her. First, she denied not, nor excused, or
extenuated the sin which he had charged her with: though she might well think
he was never able, either by witness or presumptions, to convince her of it.
Secondly, neither does she like ever the worse of him for dealing thus with
her, though (if she had had in her no better a spirit then she had at the
first) she would have scorned and defied him, that he (being so mean a person
as his habit did give him to be) should thus control her; she would have told
him, that he spoke this but out of a malicious and hard conceit that he had
either against her nation, because she was a Samaritan, or against her person,
because she had denied him water. This I say she had been likely to have done,
if she had had nothing but nature in her: but she does not so, but (out of a
tender conscience which the word of Christ and his Spirit had wrought in her)
she freely acknowledges her sin: yet does not the Evangelist (who sets down
but the brief sums of those things that were spoken and done) report that
she confessed her sin in plain terms, but that she did it in a far more
effectual manner to express her repentance, then could otherwise have been
done in so few words, more effectually, then if she should plainly have said,
It is true indeed Sir, that man that I keep is not my husband, but I live in
shameful Whoredom with him. For in these words, Sir I see that thou art a
Prophet: She does not only confess the truth of that which he charge her
with, but she does also profess the reverence and honor she bare to his
person, and that she esteemed now of him much better then she did before. And
this is the second fruit of her conversion which the Evangelist does record.
The third is this, that perceiving him to be a Prophet, and one that (through
the divine knowledge and holiness that was in him) was not only privy to her
secretest sins, but ready also to charge her with them, yet she does not (out
of a servile fear and guilty conscience) shrink away from him, and shun his
company, but desires further communication with him, and seeks instruction
and resolution from him, in a case of conscience, that did most nearly
concern her. For (being touched in conscience with remorse for her sin, and
careful to seek peace with God) she desires to be resolved by him, in the
right way how she may seek the Lord, and do him that service that may be
acceptable unto him. Now of these three signs of grace and fruits of a true
conversion that are noted in this poor Woman, let us consider in order, so as
we may receive instruction and comfort by them.

And first in that it is noted as a fruit of true conversion and repentance in
this Woman, that being charged with her sin though it were secret, she
presently acknowledges it, and says, as one being out of all doubt, and fully
resolved, Sir, I see that thou art a Prophet.

We learn: That he that is truly penitent for any sin, will be ready to
acknowledge his sin, even to men, when he is charged Doct. 1.
with it.

He will be ready to acknowledge his sin even unto men when he is charged
with it. I do not say that a man is bound to acknowledge all his secret sins
unto any Priest as the Papists teach without all warrant of Gods Word. For 1. A
man may obtain comfort and assurance of the pardon of many sins, only by
confessing them unto God, though he never acquaint any man with them, for so
David professed he did, Psalm. 32. 5. I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and
mine iniquity have I not hid: I said I will confess my transgressions unto the
Lord, and thou forgauest, etc.

2. The party that is required by the Apostle, James 5. 16. to acknowledge his
secret sins unto men, is he only that is afflicted in conscience, and cannot
by his secret confession of them unto God find comfort, as is plain by the
context, verse. 13. 14. for he requires him first in every kind of affection to
seek comfort from God by his own prayer, before he advises him to send for
the Elders of the Church.

3. The Apostle does not inioyne there, that the party that is so afflicted,
should go to the Priest only, but leaves him to his liberty, to make choice
of any other, who (for his wisdom and faithfulness, experience and love) is
fittest to yield him comfort in that case; and therefore it is to be observed,
that whereas he directs them to seek for help against the sickness of the
body, from the Elders of the Church, to whom God had given that extraordinary
gift of healing, verse 14, 15. when he comes to give them direction to seek
for help, against the sickness and affliction of the mind, he bids them not
acknowledge their faults to the Elders of the Church but one to another, verse
16.

4. This course of theirs is most opposite to Gods will: for that which he
would have kept secret, they will have to be revealed, and those things that he
would have published, they teach that secret confession will serve for; and
those sins that are discovered to the Priest under the seal of confession
(though they tend to the damage of a whole state) they teach, may in no case
be discovered.

But such sins as (being either openly committed, or any way brought to light
by the hand of God) men shall be able to reprove us for, and charge us with;
if God have given us hearts to repent of those sins, we will be willing to
acknowledge them even unto men. This we shall find proved by many examples in
the Word of God.

1. In a private man, when God had discovered Achans sin, and Ioshuah charged
him with it, and requires him not only to confess it to God but to him, Show
me and hide it not, Josh. 7. 1, 19. He confesses it not to God only, but to
Ioshuah, and the people of God that knew of his sin, and he does it freely,
fully and particularly: for he confesses more then they could charge him
with, Josh. 7. 20. 21. So when John had sharply reproved sin, and preached
repentance to his hearers, it is said, Matthew 3. 16. They came and were baptized
of him confessing their sins. The like we read of the Ephesians, Act. 19.
18. Many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their works.

2. We have the example of the Prophets and Ministers of God for this. The Lord
bids Samuel a child, charge Eli with his sins, and that in a very sharp
manner; the old man yields presently, It is the Lord (says he) let him do
what seems him good, 1. Sam. 3. 18. The Lord discovered the sin of Jonah by
a lot unto the Mariners they charge him with it, he confesses it to them, and
tells them more then they could charge him with, Jonah 1. 9. 10. he told them
his country and his religion, and how he had fled from the presence of the Lord.

3. We have the example of great men, and chief Magistrates for this. The
Prophet Nathan comes to David, and reprooues him for his sin, he presently
confesses it to him, and that in so penitent a manner, as the Prophet was
feign to comfort him presently, 2. Sam. 12, 13. and not contenting himself to
confess it to him, because his sin was grown public, and scandalous, he
make the 51. Psalm publicly to be sung in the Temple, and left to all
posterity, and in the very title of it confesses his sin, and that he could
not repent of it, till the Prophet Nathan had come to him.

The reasons why they that have grace and are truly penitent, are thus Reason.
willing to acknowledge their sin, even to men, are diverse.

1. It is a means to give satisfaction to men, whom by our sins we have 1.
offended. For no man is bound to think well of a sinner till he hear him
profess his repentance, in that place where our Savior presses this duty of
charity most, he does it upon those terms, if he turn again to thee,
saying, Irepent, thou shall forgive him, Luk 17. 4. And we are bound to give
satisfaction unto men this way, that have been offended by our sin, first be
reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift, Matthew. 5. 24. And
it is noted as a chief cause of Zedechias confusion, that he did not humble
himself before Jeremiah the Prophet, 2. Chron. 36. 12. Who knew his sin, and
had charged him with it.

2. It is a means to give glory to God, My son, give I pray thee glory to the
Lord, and make confession unto him, and tell me now what thou have done: hide 2.
it not from me, says Ioshuah to Achan. Josh. 7. 19. For as by our sins we
have dishonored the Lord, so by professing our repentance, we greatly glorify
him. That is the reason why Gods servants have published such shameful sins
against themselves. Moses reports of himself, how hardly he was drawn to go
on Gods errand unto Pharaoh, and how often he drew back, Exodus 3. and 4.
Jeremiah reports, how that in impatiency (seeing the opposition he found in his
Ministry) he cursed the day of his birth, Ier. 20. 14, etc. Paul reports, not
only before Agrippa, and many profane men, Acts 16. 11. How he had been mad
against Gods servants, and compelled them to blaspheme Christ; but to the whole
Church of God, 1. Tim. 1. 13. 15. And why did they this? they knew, that this
public acknowledgement of their sins, would gain much glory to God, and they
cared not how much they disgraced themselves, so they might honor God.

3. It is a means to give themselves assurance of Gods mercy; Pro. 28. 14. He
that confesses and forsakes his sin, shall find mercy. 1. In respect of
the assurance of pardon. That was the cause why Ioshuah, though he knew Achans
sin, and was resolved he should die for it, yet is so earnest with him to
confess it, because he would have him die with comfort. Josh. 7. 19. My son,
give I pray thee glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession unto him,
and tell me now what thou have done, hide it not from me. 2. It is a means to
find mercy with God for the recovery of their credit with men. Who thinks the
worse of David, or Paul, for the publishing of their sins? nay who thinks not
much better of them for it? and it must needs be so, because of the promise of
Christ: He that humbles himself shall be exalted says our Savior, Luke 14.
11. For as he that loses his life for Christ's sake, shall find it, Matthew.
10. ^9. So he that of conscience toward God, can be content to neglect his
credit and estimation with men, shall be sure to loose no credit by it. On the
other side, he that hides his sin shall not prosper: Pro. 28. 13. Either the
trouble of his guilty conscience shall be increased thereby, Psalm. 32. 3. When
I held my tongue my bones consumed, when I roared all the day. Or 2. he shall
be further hardened, and made more profane, and more graceless, more unable
to repent. Therefore Solomon when he had spoken of the benefit of confessing
and danger of hiding sin, adds immediately, Pro. 28. 14. Blessed is the man
that fears always, (that has a tender conscience as he has that is apt to
confess his sin) but he that hardneth his heart (as he usually does that
uses all the wit and learning he has to hide his sin) shall fall into
mischief. For 3. nothing that he takes in hand shall prosper, not his prayers,
not his meditations, Gods graces shall not prosper nor thrive in him. See an
example of this in David, who though (doubtless) he used to pray, and frequent
Gods worship, during the space of that year, which passed between his sin
and his repentance, yet all did him no good, till he had confessed his sin.

To exhort us that we therefore would seek to get our selves this testimony
of our unfeigned conversion; that when we are reproved for our sins, Use.
we can confess them. When the Lord in the Ministry of his Word, meets with
thee particularly, and thou have such secret sins discovered unto thee, as
neither the Minister himself, nor any other can charge thee with, (as often it
falls out, for the Word is lively in operation, and of a searching nature, as
the Author of it is: Heb. 4. 12, 13.) if I say when thou art thus met with,
thou would presently acknowledge thy sin unto God in secret, (as he did of
whom we read, 1. Cor. 14. 25. when the secrets of his heart were made manifest
unto him by the Ministry of the Word, he fell down on his face and worshipped
God) no doubt thou might find much comfort in it. 2. Yea we should desire
that we may be thus met with, even to hear that that particularly touches our
selves as John Baptists hearers did, Luke 3. 10. 12. 14. That mind should be
in every one of us that was in David, Let the righteous smite me (says he,
Psalm. 141. 5.) it shall be a kindness, and let him reprove me, it shall be as
excellent oil. 3. When thy sin is known, and is become offensive unto men,
thou must be willing to confess it, even unto men. Remember the danger and
curse of God threatened to them that hide their sin, and take heed of it.

Now there be many ways whereby men hide their sins. 1. By justifying and
defending them. As Jonah 4. 9. Do thou well to be angry for the Gourd, he
answered, I do well to be angry to the death. As many delight to show their
wits in defending many sins that the word condemns. 2. By denying them as
Cain, Genesis 4. 9. and Gehezi, 2. King. 5. 25. And Ananias, Acts 5. 8. 3. By
excusing and extenuating their sin, as Adam. For says Job, Job 31. 33. Adam
hid his sin; and that was only this way, he excused and extenuated it; and
so did Eve hers, he laid the fault upon the woman which God had given him, and
she upon the Serpent. Genesis 3. 12. 13. and thus did Saul seek to hide his sin
by excusing it and laying the fault upon the people, 1. Sam. 15. 21. 4. By
senseless silence not acknowledging them, or being affected with them as Judas
did, who though he heard our Savior in great trouble of spirit, speak
plainly of his sin, John 13. 21. and particularly pointed him out to be the
man, John 13. 26. 27. though he had heard the fearful words he denounced
against him for it, Mat. 26. 24. though he saw how much all the elect Apostles
were moved and troubled with it, Matthew. 26. 22. yet could not he confess his
sin, nor seek mercy, nor was once moved or troubled with it for this.

Lecture the three and twenty, August 22. 1609.
IT follows that we proceed to the second sign of grace and fruit of true
conversion in this woman, she esteemed better of Christ after he had thus
touched and reproved her then ever she did before. She now in her heart
esteems him, and with her mouth acknowledges him to be a Prophet of God; and
from hence we learn:

That he that is truly penitent will not hate or storm against him that shall
admonish or reprove him for sin, but love him the better rather. He Doct. 2.
that is poor in spirit and mournes for sin, will be meek also. Matthew. 5. 3,
4, 5. Pro. 9. 8. Rebuke a wise man and he will love thee, and 25. 12. As an
earing of gold, and an ornament of fine gold; so is a wise reprouer upon an
obedient ear: he counts it no disgrace, but an ornament and honor to him, to
be thus faithfully dealt with. David esteemed better of Nathan after he had so
plainly rebuked him, then ever he did before, see the reverent respect he
showed unto him, when he came to speak with him, he had present access to
him, 1. King. 1. 23. and you shall find, verse 27. that the King was not wont
to conceal from him, but to advise with him about all his affairs of greatest
moment, so Acts 2. The same men that had mocked the Apostles before, verse 13.
when by their ministry they were plainly rebuked, they esteemed reverently of
them. Acts 2. 37. So did he also of whom we read, 1. Cor. 14. 25. he reported
(to all men and upon all occasions) that God was of a truth in that Ministry.

Reasons. 1. Because they know God is the Author of that reproof that Reason.
is given them according to his word, whosoever be the instrument: 2. Chron.
35. 22. Though Pharaoh Necho were Josias enemy, yet the counsel and reproof
he sent him came from the mouth of the Lord, and it was his ruin, that he
hearkened not unto it. He that reprooues me for any sin according to the word,
speaks to me on Gods behalf. This is not his word, but Gods, and so to be
received, not as the word of an inferior but as the word of God; be that
despises, despises not man but God, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 8. And when we have to deal
with God, the greatest must lay aside his dignity, and think he can never be
humble enough, Judges 3. 20. Eglon himself did (in reverence) rise out of his
seat when a message was brought him from God.

2. Because they know it is a great benefit and fruit of Gods love, when he
sends his servants to deal plainly with them, and to reprove them, when so
they sin against him, Pro. 6. 23. Reproves of instruction* are the way of
life. See it in that speech, Reu. 2. 15. Whom I love I rebuke. See it also in
David's prayer. Psalm. 141. 5. Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a
kindness. Therefore is this theatned, as a grievous judgment, for God to give
over reproouing of men by his servants. Hos. 4. 4. yet let no man strive or
reprove another, for this people are as they that strive with the Priest.

3. Because they know it is the best fruit of love, that any can perform unto
them, to admonish and reprove them: thou shall not hate thy brother in thine
heart, but thou shall in any wise rebuke thy neighbor and not suffer sin upon
him says the Lord, Leu. 19. 17. And 2 Thessalonians. 3. 15. He counts thee a brother
while he admonishes thee: 2. Cor. 2. 4. I wrote to you so sharply, that you
might perceive the love which I have specially unto you. See also Pro. 27. 5,
6. Open rebuke is better then secret love, faithful are the words of a friend.

1. This Doctrine serves to exhort every Christian, to strive after, and pray
for this grace, to be able to take a Christian admonition or reproof in Use.
good part; and to love him the better that deals faithfully with him that
way; whatsoever the party be; be he a Minister, or private man. This is the
exhortation of the Apostle, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 12, 13. Esteem them highly in love,
for their works sake. And this is their chief work, verse 12. to admonish
you.

Mark. 1. How earnest the Apostle is with them in this point, he knew well,
that unless men do esteem reverently of their Ministers, and love them, they
shall never be able to profit by their Doctrine; and this experience proves
most true. 2. Mark why he would have them to love their Ministers with a
singular love (for their works sake) and what the chief work is he names,
(they admonish you) even for this cause they should love them.

Now there be three things principally that keep men from taking a reproof
in good part, against which I will labor (out of Gods Word) to strengthen you.

1. We are ready to think of every one that admonishes or reprooueth us, that
he usurps authority over us, makes himself our better, seeks 1.
to reign as a Lord, and to have our heads under his girdle. And we cannot
abide that a man whom we know to be either our inferior or equal, should
take that upon him. When Lot an equal, in the mildest manner did admonish the
Sodomites, they reject him thus, Genesis 19. 9. He is come alone as a stranger,
and shall he judge and rule? We cannot endure it from an equal. When Moses a
governor in as mild a manner as was possible, seeing two of his brethren at
variance, admonished them, and would have set them at one, saying to them, Acts
7. 26. Sirs, ye are brethren, why do you wrong one another. verse 27. He that
did the wrong thrust him away, and said, who made thee a Prince and a Judge
over us? When the Prophet came to Amaziah King of Judah, and reproved him for
his Idolatry, he was rejected with this taunt, Have they made thee the Kings
Counselor, 2. Chron. 25. 16. So that whether he be our inferior or equal,
or whether he be one that God has given a special calling unto to admonish
us, we are apt by nature to reject it upon this ground.

For strengthening our selves against this corruption, we must consider, 1.
That it is no pride, or presumption for the Minister of Christ to reprove 1.
sin in any man. Indeed every man must in reproouing of his betters, show due
reverence and respect to their calling, 1. Tim. 5. 1, 2. Rebuke not an Elder,
but admonish him as a brother, the elder women as mothers, yet it is no
presumption in the Minister of Christ to reprove sin in any man: For it is
his calling, Ezekiel. 3. 17. I have made thee a Watchman, yea we are in Christ's
room, 2. Cor. 5. 20. And it is necessary Gods people should know this. Know
them that are over you (says the Apostle) 1 Thessalonians. 5. 12. If therefore you
disdain to be taught and admonished by us, you disdain to be taught and
admonished by Christ, Luke 10. 16. He that hears you hears me, and he that
despises you, despises me, and he that despises me, despises him that sent
me.

2. It is no pride, nor presumption, nor sign of a busy body for a private
Christian to admonish or reprove his neighbor. For he has also the
commandment of God for it, Heb. 10. 24. Let us consider one another to provoke
unto love and good works, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 11. Comfort your selves together, and
edify one another as also ye do. Every man has a calling, and is charged to
see Gods law observed by others so far as in him lies.

3. It is no disparagement to the best man, to be put in mind of his duty to
God even by one, that is much his inferior, and to hearken to him. See an
example of this in a master, Naamans servants admonish him, and he by
hearkening to them received great good by it. 2. King. 5. 13. In a husband, in
all that Sarah has said unto thee hearken unto her voice, says the Lord to
Abraham, Genesis 21. 12. In a Father, Terah hearkened unto Abraham and left his
own country as appears by comparing Genesis 11. 31. and 12. 1. In a Prince, David
hearkened to the counsel of Abigail, and blessed God for it, 1. Sam. 25. 32.
33. Nay the meaner the person is that admonishes thee, the more shall thou
show thy obedience to God, and the power that his Word and Spirit has had in
thy heart, if thou hearken to his counsel, Esaias 11. 6. A little child shall
lead them.

The second corruption that hinders men from accepting reproof, is 2.
this, if we can say that the party that reprooues us, has his faults as well
as we: and every man is eloquent and witty in discovering the faults of
Preachers; either such as they are indeed guilty of, or such as are maliciously
and slanderously devised, and reported of them, and think it a sufficient
reason why they should reject all that the Preacher can say against their sins.
This we shall see an example of, John 9. 34. thou were altogether borne in
sins, and durst thou teach us?

To strengthen us against this corruption, we must consider, that though no man
can with comfort, nor ought indeed, to reprove sin in others, that is
himself a wicked man, unto the wicked says God, what have thou to do to
declare mystatutes, seeing thou hate instruction, and castest my words behind
thee, Psalm. 50. 16, 17. And a Bishop must be blameless, 1. Tim. 3. 2. Yea if
he have been heretofore infamous for any scandalous sin, and have now
repented, he ought not to exercise his function in that place, where that
infamy continues, for he must be one that has a good report even of them that
are without, lest he fall into reproach, and (by that means) into the snare of
the devil, 1. Tim. 3. 7. The cause why Paul by no means, would accept of
Mark to join with him in his Ministry, was because he had given offense to
the Church by departing from him before, Acts 15. 37, 38. Yet it is no just
exception to the reproof that is given, because we know some faults by him
that reprooues us: for then may we reject all reproof from men, seeing the
holiest Minister has his infirmities and faults, we also are men of the like
passions with you, say the Apostles themselves, Acts 14. 15. Yea it it
profitable for us, that God teaches us not by Angels, nor by his Spirit
immediately, but by poor weak men, that are sinners as well as we; for by
this means, they may teach us with more feeling, experience, and compassion,
then otherwise they could have done, this reason the Apostle gives why our
blessed Savior himself was in all things (excepting sin) made like unto us,
Heb. 2. 17. that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest. Yea, say
they that teach and reprove thee be guilty, not of humane infirmities only,
but of gross sins; yet that cannot warrant thee, either to refuse to hear
them, or to obey such reproves as they give thee by warrant from the Word of
God, for the people were bound to hear and obey the good doctrine of the
Scribes and Pharisees, though their works were naught, Matthew. 23. 2, 3. And
the people of God transgressed, because for the sins of Elyes sons the
Priests they abhorred the offerings of the Lord, 1. Sam. 2. 17. 24.

The third and last of those corruptions which usually hinder us from taking
reproof in good part is this, that we take such as reprove us (especially 3.
publicly) to be our enemies, or to be set on by some tale-bearers that love
us not: if he would have come to me (says many a one) and told me of my fault
in private, I should have takenit well; but this exclaiming of me, and
disgracing me in public, argues no love. An example of this corruption we
have in Ahab, who accounted the Prophet Eliah his enemy, 1. Kings 21. 20. and
those proud men spoken of, Ier. 43. 2, 3. who charged the Prophet that Baruch
had set him on to preach so against them as he did.

To strengthen us against this corruption, we must consider of these four
points.

1. That a man may have his sin touched and reproved in the Ministry of the
Word, when the Minister intends not to touch him, nor so much as knows of his
sin, as it was with that man that came to hear the Prophets, he was convinced
of all, he was judged of all, and had the secrets of his heart (which were
unknown both to the Prophets and to all other men) made manifest to him, 1.
Cor. 14. 24, 25. We use not to busy our selves in inquiring curiously or
maliciously into your faults, nor entertain tale-bearers; but may say to you
as the Prophet, The Lord teaches us, and shows us your practices, and makes
us able to meet with them, when we think not of you, Ierem. 11. 18, 19.

2. That when a man's offense is known and scandalous to many, the Minister is
not bound to admonish him in private; but may (without malice) reprove it
publicly, for so did John deal with the Pharisees and Sadduces, Matthew. 3. 7.
and Paul even with Peter himself, Gal. 2. 14. and we have an express
commandment for it, 1. Tim. 5. 20. them that sin (publicly and notoriously he
means) rebuke before all, that others also may fear^.

3. Though the sin be private, and known to no more but the Minister
himself; it may (oft-times be much fitter for the Minister to touch and
reprove it in his public Ministry, then to admonish the party in private;
provided, that he so touch the sin, as he touch not, nor note the person. And
that for these three reasons. 1. Howsoever most men will brag, how well they
would take it, to be admonished in private, yet they that will try it, shall
find there be very few, that will take it well. 2. There is much more power
and authority in such public reproof as I have spoken of, then in any
private, because of the promise Christ has made to be with his servants in the
execution of all the parts of their Ministerial function. Matthew. 28. 20. 3. By
such a public reproof many others may receive profit, which is the reason the
Apostle gives of that commandment, 1. Tim. 5. 20.

4. If his reproof be according to Gods Word thou ought to receive it,
whatsoever his affection be, that delivers it; yea thou should count it a
dangerous sin for thee thus to censure, and judge of the Preachers affection,
when thou can not justly blame his doctrine, and so the Lord speaks of it as
of a great sin, Hos. 4. 4. this people are as they that strive with the Priest.

This Doctrine serves also for reproof; and to discover the unsoundness and
hypoc^isie of most men. Ought every Christian to love his Minister with Use.
more then an ordinary love, and that for this cause, because he uses to
admonish and reprove him? will he that has any wisdom or grace in him, love
the man the better that rebukes him? is it not possible for any man truly to
have repented of any sin, that hates and storms against him, that dislikes and
censures his sin? then surely are most men far from grace, and far from true
repentance. For there is many a man like Ahab, who though they acknowledge
their Minister to be the faithful servant of God, as he did Micaiah, yet hate
him only because he prophecies not good to them, 1. King. 22. 8. And generally
the people hate the Ministers of the Word only for doing this work and duty
of their Ministry, they hate him that rebukes in the gate, and they abhor
him that speaks uprightly, Am. 5. 10. yea though they give them no other
occasion at all, I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury
(that is, I never had to do with them about any worldly occasions) yet every
one of them does curse me says the Prophet, Ier. 15. 10. Now I would have such
men to know that it is not the committing of any sin (how heinous soever) that
makes their case so desperate, or is so certain a sign of their perdition, as
this, that they despise admonition, Better is a poor and a wise child, then
an old and foolish King who will no more be admonished (says Solomon, Eccl. 4.
13. By this the Prophet knew that the Lord had determined to destroy Amaziah,
2. Chron. 25. 16. because he scornefully rejected his admonition and would not
receive it. And this is given as an undoubted sign of the utter ruin of the
kingdom of Judah, 2. Chron. 36. 15, 16. that when God sent them his messengers
to admonish and reprove them, they mocked his messengers and misused his
Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord rose against his people, till there was
no remedy. David committed two heinous sins, but was Gods child and found
mercy, Why? being admonished he took it well, and profited by it, 2. Sam. 12.
13. But let it be the least sin that can be committed, if being admonished, a
man will not be reclaimed, he is to be esteemed as a Heathen, and a Publican,
Matthew. 18. 17. The highest degree of sin is the sitting in the seat of the
scorner, Psalm. 1. 1. and who is a scorner? he that will not endure admonition,
but hates him that reprooues him, Pro. 9. 8.

THE FOUR AND TWENTIETH LECTVRE, ON AUGUST, XXIX. MDCIX.
IOH. IIII. XX. Our Fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in
Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.


WE have already heard, that the Evangelist in this verse and the former, does
set down the effects of that speech, whereby our Savior did discover to this
poor Woman, her secret sin, and reprooues her for it, and this he sets
forth in three notable fruits and signs of a true conversion which it brought
forth in her. 1. She acknowledges her sin. 2. She esteems far more
reverently of Christ then she did before. 3. She seeks to him for instruction
and resolution in a doubt that troubled her conscience. The two first we have
spoken of in the former verse. Now it remains that we proceed to the third and
last, as it is set down in this verse. For this must needs be acknowledged
another notable fruit of Gods Spirit, and sign of her conversion, that
(perceiving him to be a Prophet, and one that through the divine knowledge and
holiness that was in him, was not only privy to all her secretest sins, but
ready also to charge her with them, yet) she shrinkes not from him, nor leaves
his company, but desires further communication with him, and seeks
instruction and resolution of him in a case of conscience that did most nearly
concern her. Now before we can well receive that instruction, which the Holy
Ghost intended to give us in this verse, five questions must be answered for
the opening and unfolding of the meaning of the Text. 1. What the worship was
that she here speaks of. 2. What mountain was that she here speaks of. 3.
Who were these Fathers that she says did worship in that mountain. 4. What
moved her to make any doubt of this matter. 5. Why seeks she to be instructed
in this question rather then in any other.

For the first, the word that is here used (...) signifies properly
Adoration, even a bodily and outward worship, when by some reverent Quest. 1.
gesture of the body, we testify the inward subjection and honor that in our
hearts we bear unto God. Now because we can do no part of worship and service
unto God well, but there must be in it, even some bodily signification of
reverence unto him, therefore also the whole worship we do unto God, is often
called adoration: yet in this place, it is not put for the whole worship of
God, but only for the most public and solemn worship, which stood in
sacrifices and ceremonies appointed by the Lord. For she knew well that there
were many parts of Gods Worship which the Jews did use as well in any other
place as in Jerusalem. They used to pray in the Synagogue, Matthew. 6. 2. Yea and
in their private houses also. Dan. 6. 10. They used to read and preach the Word
in their Synagogues, Acts 15. 21. And they had Synagogues not in Jerusalem
only, but in all parts of the world, at Damascus, Acts 9. 2. at Salamis, Act.
13. 5. at Antioch, Act. 13. 14. at Iconium, Act. 14. 1. at Thessalonica, Act.
17. 1. at Corinth, Act. 18. 17. at Ephesus, Acts 18. 19.

2. The mountain that she speaks of here, was Mount Gerizim, as appears, not
only because both Josephus, and the author of the Macabees, Quest. 2.
2. Mac. 6. 2. do affirm that the Samaritans Temple stood upon that
mountain, whose authority (though it be merely humane, and therefore such as
the conscience of man cannot rest upon, nor be convinced by in the matter of
faith or manners either, because we know all men are subject unto error, Romans
3. 4. yet in a matter of fact and story is of some use, as those civil stories
and Chronicles were that we read of in the holy Scriptures, namely that book
of the wars of the Lord mentioned, Number. 21. 14. and that book of Iasher,
Josh. 10. 13. and that book of the acts of Solomon mentioned, 1. King. 11. 41.
But specially, because it is plain by Judge. 9. 7. that Mount Gerizim was the
Mount that stood by this town Sychem.

3. By their Fathers, she means not only the true Ancestors of the
Samaritans, which were Heathens and Infidells, as ye shall read Quest. 3.
2. King. 17. 24. But Jacob also and the Patriarchs, as ye shall find in the
12. verse.

For the fourth question. The reason of her doubt and scruple was this, 1. For
Mount Gerizim, she had reason to think it was as holy a place as Quest. 4.
Jerusalem, not only 1. because her true Ancestors had worshipped there and
in the Temple that stood there; but 2. Specially, because it was the place that
the Patriarchs and Jacob himself had worshipped in, for it is said, Genesis 33.
18. 20. that Jacob hard by Sichem built an Altar, and called it, The mighty God
of Israel; and it is very probable, that the place upon which he built that
Altar, was this Mount Gerizim, which stood hard by Sychem; for the Patriarchs
(before the Temple was built) were wont to make choice of mountains to serve
God on, for the better stirring up of their affections by the contemplation of
Gods works, and that by Gods own direction also. 1. This is noted of Abraham,
Genesis 12. 8. and 22. 2. Of Jacob, Genesis 31. 14. of the Israelites the posterity
of Jacob, Exodus 3. 12. and in a fond imitation thereof that seems to be, that
the idolatrous Jews did offer incense and power out their drink offerings
upon the roofes of their houses, Ier. 19. 13. 3. Besides upon this mountain,
the Lord had appointed that the Priests and Levites should stand to bless the
people so soon as ever they were come to the Land of Canaan, Deuteronomy. 11. 29. and
27. 12. On the other side she had reason to doubt that Jerusalem was the place
where this solemn service should be done unto God, because he whom she found
to be a Prophet of God and all of his Religion, all the Jews, did say so.

For the fifth and last question. It is no marvel though she (having the
opportunity of such a Prophet) desire to be instructed in this question, and
Quest. 5.
resolved in this doubt, rather then in any other. For 1. She might well know
by the books of Moses that there could be no atonement made between God and
her, nor remission obtained of this heinous sin, that her conscience was now
touched with remorse of, but by a Sacrifice: all things by the law were purged
with blood (of a sacrifice) and without shedding of blood there was no
remission, Heb. 9. 22. 2. She might well know that God would accept of no
Sacrifice, that was offered to him in any other place, then in that one place,
he had chosen to put his name in. Mark how often this commandment is repeated
in one Chapter: Deuteronomy. 12. 5, 6, 11, 1;, 17, 26, 27. Yea, she knew that the Lord
did account of all Sacrifices that were offered in any other place, besides
that one place, that he had chosen to put his name there, no better then of
wilful murder: Leuit. 17. 4.

Having thus opened the meaning of the Text, let us now come to the instruction
that the Holy Ghost intends to teach us in this Verse.

First, then in that this woman is not afraid of Christ, when she had found
him to be a Prophet that had searched and troubled her conscience, but desires
further speech with him, and seeks to have her conscience healed by that very
hand, that had wounded it; We learn:

That he that has grace will not be afraid of, or shun that ministry, in
which he has felt the power of God rebuking and judging him; ransaking Doct. 3.
and troubling his conscience for sin, but (of all others) will desire it
most. See the proof of this in all sorts of John's hearers. He had preached
the Law, Luke 3. 7. to 9. yea Luke 1. 17. in the spirit and power of Elias. Yet
see Luke 3. 10. 12. 14. How all sorts seek to him and depend upon him. See
this also in such as heard Peter, when by his ministry they had been pricked
in their hearts with a effectual sight and sense of their sins and of the
wrath of God due to them for the same, they run to him for comfort rather then
to any other man, and says unto him and the rest of the Apostles, Men and
brethren what shall we do? Acts 2. 37. This will better appear by comparing
it with the contrary. Ungodly men cannot endure such teachers, as do with any
power reprove sin, and preach the Law, as we may see in the example of Ahab,
who for this cause could not endure Micaiah, 1. King. 22. 8. And of Felix, who
when Paul's doctrine made his heart to tremble by putting him in mind
effectually and in a powerful manner of the chief sins he had been most
given unto, and of the dreadful judgment he must come to for them, would
hear him no more, Act. 24. 26. But so will not they (as we have heard) that
have truth of grace in them.

1. The sense of sin, and trouble of conscience which Gods Spirit works in
the Elect is ever mixed, with hope of mercy, and sense of Gods Reason.
love, which keeps them from flying from God, or dispairing in his mercy:
Psalm 2. 11. Even in trembling they have some joy. He is called the comforter
even when he rebukes us for sin, John 16. 8, 9. when he makes them mourn for
their sin, as for their own child, yet he makes them supplicate and seek
to God: Zach. 12. 10. You shall see this in Peter, he was deeply touched with
remorse for sin, Mark 14. 75. Yet was he of all the Apostles the forwardest
in seeking to Christ, though John did outrun him and gat to the Sepulcher
before him, yet went he first into the Sepulcher, to see that there that might
confirm him in the faith of the Resurrection of Christ, Ioh. 20. 6, 7.

2. The experience he has that God works with such a Minister, must needs
cause the child of God to reverence and like him, and to expect a blessing
from him rather then from another. That is said to be the cause of the
reverence which the vnbelieuer did show to the Prophets when he was rebuked
and judged of them, 1. Corinthians 14. 25. This makes them to acknowledge them
and reverence them as able Ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter
only, but of the spirit and power of God, 2. Cor. 3. 6.

3. He knows the Lords manner has been to heal his servants by the very
hand, by which he has wounded them. The Prophet Gad was the man, by whom the
Lord sent such a heavy message to David: 1. Chron. 21. 10. 15. And he was also
the man, by whom the Lord gave him comfort, verse 18. Esaias was the man by whom
the Lord sent such a message to Ezechia, as made him weep soar, Esaias 38. 3.
and Esaias was the man by whom God gave him comfort, Esaias 38. 4. to 8.

1. This Doctrine serves for a Touchstone whereby every one may try whether he
have any grace, or be still a carnal man dead in his sins. For Use.
by the judgment thou have, to discern of true preaching, and of the
Minister, which is most to be affected, thou may know thine own state. If
grace be in thy heart thou will affect that ministry the most, not that
delights or tickleth the ear, no nor that which only brings thee to
knowledge, but that wherein thou feel the spirit and power of God working
upon thy heart rebuking thee for sin, wounding thy conscience and giving thee
no rest till it have reformed thy heart. This Paul speaks of his own
Ministry, 1. Cor. 2. 4. My preaching (says he) stood not in the enticing
speech of man's wisdom, but in plain evidence of the Spirit, and of power,
and makes this a note of an able and sufficient Minister: 2. Cor. 3. 6. And of
the Corinthians (he says) that they were carnal men because they affected
such a Ministry as had fine words but no power in it: 1. Cor. 3. 4. For though
he names himself and Apollos there, he does it but figuratively as he says:
1. Cor. 4. 6. But the men they affected were not Paul nor Apollos, but their
own vainglorious teachers, whom he describes: I will come and know, not the
speech of these men that are puffed up, but the power. For the Kingdom of God
is not in word but in power, says he, 1. Cor. 4. 19, 20. Then the hearer that
has grace, when he comes to a Sermon, comes not to hear man, but God; not to
hear what a man can say, or to judge, what gifts the Preacher has, but to
hear what the Spirit speaks to the Church: Apoc. 2. 7. He comes with that
mind that David did: Psalm 85. 8. I will hear what God the Lord will speak.

2. This Doctrine serves for reproof and to discover the hypocrisy of most
men; to show that most hearers have no grace in them. For though 2.
they be content to hear sometimes, and to hear ordinarily, yea, and to be at
charge also with maintaining the Ministry of the Word among them, (as many most
ungodly men that we have read of in the word have been content to do) yet in
three things they show themselves to be carnal and ungodly men. 1. In that in
their hearing, they respect not edification but delight only, and the tickling
of their ears. The word it self which is the food of our souls, they respect
not so much as they do the art, and eloquence, and other gifts of the man that
does deliver it unto them; They esteem much more of the sauce and cookery,
then they do of the meat it self. Yea, a carnal kind of teaching, wherein
there is nothing but show and ostentation of humane gifts (as wit, memory,
reading, eloquence, and the like) they do prefer much, before that Ministry,
wherein the evidence and power of Gods Spirit is seen and felt. For that
teaching wherein there is nothing but the plain interpretation of the
Scripture, by Scripture, and application of it to the use of the Church, they
despise, and count it as the conceited Corinthians also did: 1. Cor. 1. 21. The
foolishness of preaching. We grant that he that should convert souls had need
have the tongue of the learned, Esaias 50. 4. and that knowledge of the arts and
tongues, are to be acknowledged excellent helps and ornaments, unto a
Preacher. Paul thanks God for the gift of tongues, 1. Cor. 14. 18. And also
that without study and reading, no man can be fit to perform this work well,
as is plain by the charge the Apostle gives, 2. Tim. 4. 13. When thou come
to me, bring with thee the books, but specially the parchments. Paul himself
made use of books though he were so great an Apostle. Yet it is certain, that
the power of the Spirit of God, for the working upon the conscience, lies
neither in the sentences of any Fathers or other Authors, nor in the art and
eloquence of the Teachers, but in the Word it self, Luke 8. 11. The seed is
the Word of God, Heb. 4. 12. The Word is lively and mighty in operation,
Psalm 19. 7. The Law of the Lord is that that conuerts the soul. Ierem. 23.
29. Is not my word like fire, and as a hammer? 2. In that they cannot endure
that Ministry, that does with any power reprove sin, specially those sins,
themselves are given unto; but use to indent with their teachers, and limit
them, as they did of whom the Prophet speaks, Esaias 30. 10. They said unto the
Prophets, prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things,
Prophesy deceits. 3. Though they do both hear ordinarily, and in words also
commend the faithfullest Ministers, yet in their deeds and unreformed lives,
they shame and disgrace their Teachers. The only good commendation and
testimony the people can give their Teachers, is this, when the power and
virtue of their Teachers Ministry, may appear in the reformation of their
lives. When it may be said to them: 2. Cor. 3. 2. Ye are our Epistle written in
our hearts read and known of all men.

Lecture the five and twentieth, September 12. 1609.
IT remains now, that we come to the second of those three principal points
I told you were to be observed in this verse. viz. The question she moves
unto Christ; which is about the true worship; about the most public and
solemn worship of God, as I showed you the last day. Now the word that the
Evangelist uses to express this worship by, that he speaks of, is (...),
which signifies to adore, so that the words may be plainly and fitly thus
translated; Our Fathers adored in this mountain, etc. Now, adoration (to
speak properly of it) is an outward and bodily worship, when by some reverent
gesture of the body, we testify the inward reverence, and subjection of the
heart. And the Greek word which the Evangelist here uses (in his primitive
sense) signifies to give a kiss unto another, and it is taken from a custom
they had in old time, to testify the reverence and subjection they did bear
to any, by giving them a kiss. So soon as Samuel had anointed Saul to be
King to testify his homage to him, he gives him a kiss. 1. Sam. 10. 1. When
the Lord would describe his people that had not given religious worship unto
Baal, he calls them such as had not bowed their knee to him, nor give him a
kiss with their mouths. 1. King. 19. 18, And when the Prophet would exhort
the great men of the world to worship Christ, and to acknowledge him their Lord
and King, he bids them kiss the Son least he be angry, Psalm. 2. 12.

Now the thing that we are first of all to observe at this time is, that the
true worship of God is called adoration. In the four verses following Christ
calls all that do any true worship unto God, such as do adore him. So the
whole worship whereto the Gentiles should be called, is signified under this
Phrase, Esaias 45. 23. unto me every knee shall bow. And in this verse you see,
they that did perform public and solemn worship to God in his Temple, are
said to adore him. Acts 8. 27. The Eunuch is said to have come to Jerusalem to
adore, and Acts 24. 11. Paul says of himself, he came to Jerusalem to Adore.
And from hence we have this to learn for our instruction:

That no man can perform any Part of Gods worship well, (specially of his
public and solemn worship) without some signification of Doct. 4.
his reverence and subjection unto God, even in the outward gesture and
behavior of his body. It is true, 1. That this is not enough, for the chief
est part of Gods service; but when with the soul we worship him, for thus
far an hypocrite may go. 2. It is a high degree of contempt done to God,
when we think it enough to give him the knee, if the heart bow not to him, if
we scrue him not with the heart: it is as the offering of the blind, lame and
sick in Sacrifice, of which the Lord says, Mal. 1. 8. is that no evil? offer
it to thy Prince, etc. Yet is the service of the body also necessary, and a
part of Gods worship. The chief worship we do unto God, is done not with the
body, but with the soul and Spirit; as we shall hear when we come to speak
of the 23. verse of this Chapter, when in true reverence and subjection we bow
our hearts unto him, to walk in his ways, and whatsoever reverence we can
make show of with our bodies, if our hearts do not withal thus bow unto him,
it is but abominable hypocrisy in the sight of God. But yet is it not
sufficient to worship God with our souls and hearts, if in every part of his
worship we do not also adore, and give bodily worship unto him, and by the
reverent behavior of our body, testify the inward submission and reverence of
our hearts unto him, though our souls therein were never so full of reverence
and devotion, yet do we but serve him by the halues, neither can our service
be acceptable unto him.

You shall hear this confirmed to you by the examples of Gods servants that
are commended to us by the Holy Ghost. See the conscience Gods people have made
of this in all the parts of Gods worship. Observe it in five points,

1. In prayer, when they even in private have prayed to God, they have been
wont to kneel. For this we have the example of Daniel, Dan. 6. 10. and of our
Savior himself, Luke 22. 41.

2. When they have given thanks (though but in private) they have used
adoration. When Abraham's servant perceived that God had prospered his journey
so far forth as to bring him, and guide him safely to Bethuells house,
presently he lifted up his heart in thankfulness to God, yet thought not that
enough, but Genesis 24. 26. The man bowed himself and worshipped the Lord. And as
his success increased, so his thankefullnesse to God increased, and so did the
outward reverence of his body also, verse 52. When Abraham's servant heard them
give consent that Rebecca might go with them, then he bowed himself to the
very earth to the Lord. So Jacob being to give thanks unto God, and unable
through weakness to stand or kneel, yet in token of reverence, raised
himself up to his beds bead, and being not able through feebleness to sit
upright, he leaned, and bore himself upon his staff, and so adored God, Gone.
47. 31. Heb. 11. 21. See the conscience the good old man made of this duty, and
the pains he took in it.

3. When they have taken an oath, they have been wont to use such gestures of
their body as might stir up reverence in their hearts, Genesis 14. 22. Abraham
when he swear, he lift up his hand to the Lord, the most high Possessour of
heaven and earth.

4. When a message has been brought them immediately from the Lord, they have
been wont in token of their reverence, to rise and stand up. Judges 3. 20.
When Ehud told Eglon that he had a message to do to him from God, presently
Eglon rose out of his throne, though he was a wicked man, yet this he
(doubtless) had learned, from the custom and practice of Gods people. So did
Balaam likewise require Balaac the King to do: Number. 23. 18. Rise up Balaac and
hear. Nehem. 8. 5. When Ezra opened the book of the Law to read, all the
people stood up. Rise up ye women that be at ease (says the Lord) Esaias. 32.
9. hear my voice, alluding (doubtless) in that speech to the holy custom
used among Gods people at the first intimation given them of a message from God.

5. Lastly in the public, and solemn worship of God specially, they have held
themselves bound to show this outward reverence, Psalm. 29. 1, 2. The Psalmist
calls upon great men to give to God the glory due to his name, and tells them
how they may do that, adore him, bow your selves to him in his glorious
Sanctu^y. So Psalm. 95. 6. Mark how many words the Prophet uses to persuade to
this, when he calls men to the public worship. Come, let us adore, and fall
down, and kneel, before the Lord our maker. Therefore the reverence to be
done in Gods public worship, is made a chief means to preserve Religion, and
coupled with the observation of the Sabbath, Leu. 19. 30. and 26. 2. Ye shall
keep my Sabboths, and reverence my Sanctuary.

The Reasons of this Doctrine are of two sorts: Some concern the outward
Reason.
reverence to be used, in all the parts of Gods worship, whether private, or
public; some peculiarly concern the public and solemn worship of God.

1. The humility that befits every one, even the greatest person to show 1.
when he has to do with God. See this in David's speech to Michol, 2. Sam. 6.
20. 22. when he danced before the Arc she scoffed at him, he answers, it was
before the Lord, and adds, I will be more vile, and I shall lose no honor by
it. It is no disparagement for the greatest to debase, and humble himself to
the very dust before the Lord, nay we can never be humbled enough, Behold now
(says Abraham, Genesis 18. 27.) I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord
which am but dust and ashes, and indeed who are we (even the best of us) that
we should presume to speak unto God, or to appear before him: It becomes all
men to cast down their crowns before him, as the 24. Elders did, Reu. 4. 10.
Yea the holy Angels (Esaias 6. 2.) cover their faces in his presence. No service
we can do is pleasing to him, unless it proceed from an heart humbled in the
sense of his high Majesty, and our own vileness. Psalm. 2. 11. Serve the Lord
with fear. Mic. 6. 6. Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow my self
before the high God. Eccl. 5. 1. Be not rash with thy mouth, neither let thine
heart be hasty to utter a matter before God, for God is in the heavens and thou
in the earth, etc.

2. Our bodies are the Lords as well as our souls, and therefore he will be 2.
served with the body also. They are his by right of Creation, Redemption,
Sanctification, This Reason the Apostle gives, ye are bought with a price,
therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods, 1. Cor.
6. 20.

3. That the humility and reverent gesture of the body, may help to humble 3.
and work reverence in the heart. Our hearts are profane, and stand in need of
all good outward helps, to stir up devotion in them. That is a chief reason
why it was used both by Daniell 6. 10. and Christ, Luke 22. 41. even in secret
prayer, and if they needed to do so, how much more do we.

4. To profess and testify the humility of the heart, and reverence of the 4.
soul. Therefore is this put for the whole profession of our homage and
obedience to God, Unto me every knee shall bow, Esaias 45. 23. Because in matter
of Gods service, hypocrites are wont to pretend, they have as good hearts as
the best, the Lord is wont also to call so often for the service of the body, Let
not sin reign in your mortal body, Romans 6. 12. and present your body as a
living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, Romans 12. 1. and glorify God in
your body, 1. Cor. 6. 20.

The reasons of that outward reverence that is to be used specially in the
public and solemn worship of God, are three.

1. The presence of Gods people. There is a reverence due from the greatest
Prince to the meanest of Gods servants, his brother must not seem vile unto
him, no not then when by any fault he has made himself worthy of punishment,
Deuteronomy. 25. 3. Matthew. 18. 10. See that ye despise not one of these little ones:
but specially to the congregation of Gods people, when they are assembled to
serve him. This reason the Apostle gives against certain abuses in the
congregation of Corinth, 1. Cor. 11. 22. have ye not houses to eat and drink
in (he might have said, if he had lived amongst us, to sleep in, to talk, and
laugh in) despise ye the Church of God.

2. The presence of the holy Angels, which as they have a charge from God to
minister and do service to his people, Heb. 1. 15. and to pitch their tents
about them, Psalm. 34. 7. so specially at that time when they are assembled
together to serve the Lord. This was figured to Gods people under the law. The
curtains that the Tabernacle was made of, were full of Cherubins, Exodus 26. 1.
So were the walls of Salomons Temple round about. 1. King. 6. 29. to typifie
the presence and attendance of the holy Angels upon the whole Church and body
of Gods people for their protection and safety, as at all other times, and in
all other places, so specially in their Church assemblies. This reason the
Apostle gives, why women should have modest attire in the congregation. 1. Cor.
11. 10. The woman ought to have power on her head because of the Angels.

3. The presence of the Lord himself, who though he be every where, (Ier. 23.
24. Do not I fill heaven and earth says the Lord, Acts 7. 48. The most high
dwells not in Temples made with hands) yet is he in a special sort present
in the congregation of his people, as is evident by those two promises made by
our blessed Savior, Matthew. 18. 20. and 28. 20. In which respect the public
worship of God is called the face and presence of God, Psalm. 105. 4. and 42. 2.
And Cain being for his murder deprived of the benefit of Gods public worship,
complains he should now be hid from his face, Genesis 4. 14. That is the reason
of David's desire, to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of his life:
Psalm. 27. 4. That I may says he behold the beauty of the Lord. And Psalm. 48.
9. We wait for thy loving kindness O Lord in the midst of thy Temple. The
place of Gods public worship under the Law, is called the glorious Sanctuary.
Psalm. 26. 2. because the glory of the Lord did sensibly appear in the
Tabernacle, Exodus 40. 34. and the Temple, 1. King. 8. 10. And the Assemblies of
Gods people now may as well be called glorious, because the glory of the Lord
appears also in them, though not so sensibly, yet no less comfortably and
effectually, as is plain by that comparison the Apostle makes between that
ministry and worship of God that was under the Law and this that is under the
Gospel, and by his preferring this (for glory and excellency) far above the
other, 2. Cor. 3. 8, 9. 11.

Lecture the six and twentieth, September 19. 1609.
THe Use that is to be made of this Doctrine, is: 1. For Exhortation. 2. For
reproof. 1. To exhort all men that they would learn to carry Use.
themselves reverently, in all the parts of Gods worship and service, specially
in his public worship. And that ye may learn this the better, I will give you
certain rules out of Gods Word for your direction in this case. And these
rules shall be of three sorts. 1. Such as belong in common to the whole worship
of God. 2. Such as concern the public worship of God in general. 3. Such as
are particular, and concern the several parts of that worship we do unto God
in the public assemblies.

And of those rules that are common to the whole worship of God, this is the
first.

1. We are not bound to use all the same gestures in Gods worship now, which we
read in Scripture were of use among Gods people, but such as by which in the
Country where we live, men are wont to express their reverence unto their
Superiors. For this we find was the rule the faithful have followed in all
ages. We read that Ioshuah, and the Elders of Israel, when they had received
the foil at the siege of Ai, and came before the Ark of the Lord to pray,
they rent their clothes and put dust upon their heads. Josh. 7. 6. And
Hezekiah when he came into the house of the Lord to pray at that time when
Senacharib besieged Jerusalem, rent his clothes and put on sackcloth, Esaias 37.
1. Now none of these ceremonies and fashions were peculiar unto Gods worship,
or appropriated thereunto, but such as (in their common use and custom) men in
those times and countries did use to express their grief by. For rending the
clothes, and putting dust and ashes on the head, we have an example in Tamars
case, 2. Sam. 13. 19. and for putting on sackcloth in Benhadads servants: 1.
King. 20. 31. So we read, Josh. 7. 6. that in prayer he and the Elders fell
down to the ground on their faces. So did our Savior, Matthew. 26. 39. But this
gesture was not peculiar to Gods service, but such as was taken from the civil
use of those times and countries to express their reverence to their
Superiors, in that manner, as we see in the example of Ruth, Ruth 2. 10. So
their teachers were wont to sit, when they taught the Scribes, Matthew. 23. 2.
Our Savior, Matthew. 5. 1. and 13. 2. and 26. 25. Luke 5. 3. and 4. 20. John 8.
2. the Apostles, Acts 8. 11. upon the same ground doubtless, because (in
civil use) men were wont by that posture of their body to express that which
they did in their places, they did with authority and not as private men, as
appears by that phrase so often used, Psalm. 69. 12. Pro. 28. 1. King. 29. 27.

2. The second rule that concerns our reverent behavior in the whole worship
of God is this. More liberty may be taken in private and secret duties of Gods
worship, then in public, and that both in the use of outward gestures, and in
forbearing the use of them. 1. Knocking of the breast (^s Luke 18. 13. in a
private prayer though the place were public) lifting up the eyes and hands to
heaven, sighing and groaning, and shedding of tears, use of the voice, yea,
extention of it by crying and roaring, may fitly be used in secret prayer; but
not so in public, because danger and appearance of hypocrisy may be in it if
we use these before others, if we go beyond the rest of the congregation
therein, therefore our Savior Matthew. 6. 16, 17. charge us carefully to
conceal from men all shows and appearances of our private devotion. Therefore
Nehem. 2. 4. Nehemiah prayed, but used no gesture. 2. In secret prayer we may
pray in our bed lying all along, and on horse back, and at our tables sitting;
but in the congregation to do so could not be without evil example, and so
offensive and scandalous.

3. The third rule is, outward gestures may be omitted when we cannot use them
without evident danger of health, or with such pain to the body as would
distract and trouble the mind in Gods service. For 1. God prefers mercy before
sacrifice. Matthew. 12. 7. 2. No outward gesture can be acceptable to God when it
hinders the service of the heart and spirit.

The Rules that concern the whole public worship of God in general, are
five. 1. The first of them is this: that for the reverence of Gods public
worship, care must be had that the place where the congregation assembleth may
be decent and comely. True it is, it is neither needful nor fit that our
temples should be either for building or furniture so glorious and rich as was
that of Jerusalem. Of that it was said, Ier. 17. 12. A glorious high Throne
from the beginning is the place of our Sanctuary. For the stateliness of that
house was ceremonial and typical, it was a type of the spiritual grace and
glory of the body and kingdom of Christ Jesus, as is plain by that which we
read, John 1. 14. ^6 compared with John 2. 19, 21. It has been the folly and
superstition of the Papists to think that their temples could never be (for
their building and furniture) stately and glorious enough; or that the
magnificence and rich ornaments of these temples does add any thing to the
worship that is done unto God in them. When our Savior heard some admiring the
building of the Temple, and how it was garnished with goodly stones and
consecrate things, he reproved their folly, and said unto them. Are these the
things that ye look upon, Luke 21. 5, 6. 2. Neither is that holiness to be
ascribed, or reverence due to our Temples, as there was to that; Gods special
presence was tied, to that place his eye and his heart should be there
continually, 2. Chron. 7. 16. Of that Temple the Lord said he had hallowed it,
to put his Name there for ever, and a special promise was made to the prayers
made in that Temple, 2. Chron. 7. 15. Mine eyes shall be open and my ears
attend to the prayer made in this place. Therefore Gods people esteemed that
the best and fittest place even for their private and secret prayers, as we see
in the examples both of Anna, Luke 2. 37. and of the good Publican, Luke 18.
10. And when they could not go thither to pray, yet they were wont to make
their private prayers toward the Temple, Dan. 6. 10. But we do not find that
ever they showed that reverence and respect to any of their Synagogues; they
were not wont to go into their Synagogues to make private prayer. Our Savior
notes that to have been the fashion of hypocrites only, Matthew. 6. 5. Such
holiness I say is not to be ascribed, neither is there such reverence due to
our Temples. They are never a whit more holy then our houses are, neither is
Gods presence tied to them, but to the congregation, and Gods people assembled,
and the exercises of Religion performed in them; they are never a whit fitter
places to make our private prayers in, then our own houses and chambers are,
then when thou prayest (he means this of private prayer) enter into thy closet
says our Savior, Matthew 6. 6. 3. There is not that necessity of a Temple for
Gods worship now, as there was for the ceremonial worship that was commanded
under the Law: for that might be performed in no other place but in the Temple,
Deuteronomy 12. 13, 14. In so much as when the Temple was profaned by Idolatry and
shut up from Gods people as in the days of Ahaz: 2. Chron. 28. 24. So as they
could not possibly come into it; and for seventy years together while they
were in captivity, yet durst they not presume, no, not in this case of
necessity, to do it in any other place. But the public service of God now is
not so tied to any Temple, but that when we cannot have Temples to do it in,
it may be performed every whit as acceptably to God, and as much for the
comfort of Gods people, in another place. Our Savior preached sometimes in the
mountains: Mat. 5. 1. 2. Sometimes out of a ship: Mar. (...). 1, 2. Sometimes in
private houses; Mar. 2. 2. So did Paul: Acts 28. 30, 31. So for public prayer,
the Godly used it sometimes in private houses: Act. 1. 13, 14. Sometimes by the
rivers side: Act. 16. 13. The Sacrament of Baptism has been administered in a
private house: Act. 10. 48. and 16. 33. And the Sacrament of the Lords Supper
also: Act. 20. 7, 8. But though all this be so, Yet even of our Temples it may
also be said. 1. It is fit we should have some places to assemble in, that are
set apart for this purpose. And when we may have such, Gods public worship is
no where so well performed as in the Temple. Therefore Christ's custom was
chiefly to preach in the Synagogues and Temples: John 18. 20. 2. For the
reverence of Gods public worship, care should be had, that the place where the
congregation assembleth, may be decent and comely. And that there should be
some outward beauty and comeliness in those things that are used in Gods
service. It is noted as an argument of the holiness of the Centurion, and love
he bare to the Jews Religion, that he built them a Synagogue, and at his
charge provided them a fit place to worship God in: and our Savior when he
heard it, was the rather moved to go and help his servant: Luke 7. 5, 6. And
our Savior (as little as he regarded stateliness and pomp in the whole
course of his life) yet he made choice of an upper chamber that was large and
trimmed, and prepared to celebrate the Passover, and the Lords Supper in: Mark
14. 15.

The second general rule is. At our coming into the Congregation, and during
the whole time of our abode in the Congregation, we 2.
should behave our selves reverently. We may not come into this place, as we
would do into a dancing School, or Playhouse, leaping, or laughing, or
^oying: neither may we go out of this place, as we would do out of such a
one. But in our very coming in, and going out, and whole outward carriage, we
should give some signification of the reverence that we bear to this place,
and that we do indeed account it the House of God. When God had revealed
himself to Jacob in Bethell, and he perceived that God was in that place and
he not aware (and I showed you the last day, that the Lord is in a special
sort present in our Church Assemblies also) it is said, he was moved with
reverence (as the best translators read it) and said, how reverent is this
place, this is none other then the House of God, and this is the gate of
Heaven: Genesis 28. 6, 7. So David also professes he would go to Gods House in
the multitude of his mercies, and in his fear he would worship toward his
holy Temple, Psalm. 5. 7. All things that are done in the Congregation should be
done to edifying: 1. Cor. 14. 26. We should so carry our selves, as our good
example herein, may edify and stir up reverence in others, and not so, as we
may grieve and give offense to others.

The third general rule is this. We must come all to the beginning of Gods
public worship, and tarry till all be done. See this Zach. 8. 21. 3.
And the inhabitants of one City, shall go to another, saying, let us go
speedily to pray before the Lord, and to seek the Lord of Hosts, I will go
also. Ezekiel. 46. 10. The Prince shall go in, when they go in, and when they
go forth, they shall go forth together. Yea, It is the duty of Gods people in
reverence of his public worship, to be here before the beginning. It becomes
them to wait for the Minister of God, and not to let him wait for them. The
conversion of the Gentiles is noted by this sign that (they shall so love the
word of Christ that) they shall wait for his Law. Esaias 42. 4. And to such
hearers is the blessing promised: Proverbs 8. 34. Blessed is the man that
hears me, watching daily at my gates, and giving attendance at the posts of
my doors. It is said of Cornelius (and yet he was a great man and a Captain)
that when he had sent for Peter, he called together his kinsfolk, and special
friends, before Peter came, and waited for him: Acts 10. 24. And for tarrying
till the end, we have a notable example, Luke 1. 21. Though the public worship
that Zachary the Priest performed, were not such as the people could make that
use of, as our people may make of every thing, that the Minister uses in our
assemblies; and though Zachary tarried much longer then ordinary, yet they
waited till he had done, and would not away till he had dismissed them, and
given them the blessing. The reasons of this are two. 1. There is nothing done
in our assemblies, but all may receive profit by. 1. By the confession of
sins and all other prayers used in the congregation, a man may receive more
profit and comfort then by any other. That is the reason why the Apostles (even
after the Ascension of Christ, when the typical honor of the Temple was
abolished, and it had no more holiness in it, then our Temples have) were so
delighted to go to the Temple to pray, at the times of public prayer: Acts 3.
1. and 22. 17. And all the Godly women at Philippi even with peril of their
lives, were wont every Sabbath to meet together, only for prayer: Acts 16. 13.
2. By hearing of the Word read in the congregation, all may profit, as you may
see: Deuteronomy. 31. 12, 13. Thou shall read this law, before all Israel in their
hearing that they may hear and that they may learn to fear the Lord your God
and observe to do all the words of this law. 3. By hearing the Word preached,
even by the meanest Minister of Christ, all may profit, if the fault be not in
themselves, James 1. 21. It is able to save our souls, 1. Cor. 14. 21. Ye may
all prophecy one by one, that all may learn, and may have comfort. 4. The
singing Psalms in the congregation, furthers the fruit of the Word in the
hearts of all the hearers; When the Apostle exhorts the faithful that they
would let the word of Christ dwell in them richly in all wisdom, Colos. 3.
16. he tells them that (to that end) they should teach and admonish one another
in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. 5. All the faithful may receive
benefit by the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: 1. Cor. 10. 16. The cup of
blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The
bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the body of Christ? 6. By
being present at the administration of Baptism, all may receive profi^, for
thereby we are put in mind of the Covenant, that God made with us in our
Baptism, and the benefit that was sealed to us by it; that which is said by
the Apostle, Romans 4. 11. of Circumcision, may be said likewise of baptism that
is come into the room of it, it is a seal of the righteousness which is by
faith. And we are also thereby put in mind of the Covenant we made with God in
our Baptism, whereof it is good we be often put in mind, as appears by the
care Ioshuah had to set up a great stone by the Sanctuary to keep in the
remembrance of the people, the Covenant they had made with God, Josh. 24. 26.
27. Thereby also we perform a duty of love to the infant and his parents, and
to do good (in this kind especially) we should not forget, for with such
sacrifices (and fruits of our love) God is well pleased, Heb. 13. 16. 7. By the
blessing pronounced by Gods Minister, all may receive good. When Aaron and his
sons should bless the people, the Lord says they should put his name upon
the children of Israel, and he would bless them, Number. 6. 27. When the Priest
and the Levites blessed the people, 2. Chron. 30. 27. it is said; Their cry was
heard, and their prayer came up to heaven, his holy habitation.

2. Though we could receive no profit by the exercises used in our assemblies,
yet we must be present at them all, to do our homage unto God, and show the
reverent respect we have to his ordinances: for there is nothing done in Gods
public worship among us: but it is done by the institution and ordinance, and
commandment of the Lord.

1. It is his ordinance that whenever the congregation assembleth, there
should be all sorts and kinds of prayer used, yea this is a chief duty to be
performed in our assemblies, 1. Tim. 2. 1, 2. I exhort therefore, that first of
all supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for
all men. For Kings and for all that are in authority, etc.

2. It is his ordinance that in our public assemblies the Word should be read,
Deuteronomy. 31. 11, 12. When all Israel is come to appear before the Lord thy God in
the place which he shall choose, thou shall read this law before all Israel
in their hearing: Gather the people together, men, women and children, and thy
stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may
learn and fear the Lord your God, and observe to do all the words of this
law. And it is plain by that place, Acts 13. 15. compared with Acts 15. 21.
that it was the custom of the Jews (while they continued to be the true
Church and people of God) to read the Law and the Prophets (the whole
Canonical Scripture) in all their Synagogues every Sabbath day.

3. It is his ordinance that the Word should be preached, interpreted, and
applied in our public assemblies, Eccl. 4. 17. When thou go into the house
of God be more ready to hear, etc. Acts 15. 21. Moses after he was read, was
preached in the Synagogue every Sabbath day.

4. It is his ordinance that the Lords Supper should be administered in the
public assemblies, It was not only the custom of the people of God in
Corinth to receive this Sacrament in the Church and place of their public
assemblies as is plain by that which the Apostle writes, 1. Cor. 11. 22. but
they are also charged and commanded by him so to do, verse 33. 34 Wherefore my
brethren, when ye come together to eat (the Lords Supper he means, as
appears plainly by that which went before) tarry one for another; And if any
man hunger, let him eat at home, that ye come not together unto condemnation.

5. It is his ordinance that Baptism should be administered in the public
assemblies; as John did administer it in a solemn assembly, so our Savior
when he desired it, sent not for John to come to him to Nazaret to administer
it, but came (though along journey, fourteen Dutch miles as Geographers
think) from Nazaret to Bethabara, where John used to baptize, Matthew. 3. 13.

6. It is Gods ordinance that in our public assemblies Psalms should be sung,
for as it is evident by their titles that they were penned for the use of the
whole Church in the most solemn worship of God; so were they used accordingly
not only by David, 1. Chron. 16. 4. 7. and Iehosaphat, 2. Chron. 20. 21. 22.
and Iehu did, 2. Chron. 33. 15. and Hezekiah, 2. Chron. 29. 30. but by our
blessed Savior himself also, at the celebration of the Passover and of his
holy Supper, Matthew. 26. 38. yea it is plain by Psalm. 81. 4. that there was a
direct commandment and law of God, that required them so to do.

7. It is his ordinance that the Minister should dismiss the congregation, by
pronouncing Gods blessing upon them, Number. 6. 23. Deuteronomy. 10. 8. and 21. 5. So
that to refuse to come to any part of Gods public worship, or to go away
before all is done, is a disgrace and contempt done to the ordinance of God.

The fourth general rule is this, we must (when we are present) join with the
congregation in all the parts of Gods worship, and do as the 4.
congregation does. I speak not of every congregation; but of a congregation
of the faithful, of a congregation that is instructed and reformed according
to the Word of God. It makes much for the comeliness and reverence of Gods
worship, that all things in the Congregation be done in good order, and without
confusion, 1. Cor. 14. 40. Paul being absent from them, rejoiced to think upon
the reverend and goodly order that was in the assemblies of the Colossians.
Col. 2. 5. And it is a principal part of the good order that should be in the
Congregation when they all come together, and go together, pray together, sing
together, and kneel together. In a word, when every part of Gods worship is so
performed by the Congregation, as if the whole Congregation were but one man;
and on the other side it is a great confusion, when while some are hearing,
others are praying; some sing, and some are silent. Therefore it is said,
Nehem. 8. 1. All the people assembled themselves as one man, and Acts 2. 46.
They continued daily in the Temple (...), with joint consent, as if they had
had all but one soul. And it is not fit for any Christian, either to come
short of, or go beyond the Congregation in gestures of reverence and devotion
in the public worship of God.

The fifth and last general rule is this, we must teach our servants and
children to show reverence to the Sanctuary and public worship of God. Men 5.
may not suffer their children and servants to show contempt unto it. I showed
you the last day, that the keeping of the Sabbath, and reverence of the
Sanctuary are twice coupled together, Leuit. 19. 30. and 26. 2. Because no man
can keep the Sabbath well, that does not reverence the Sanctuary. And for the
Sabbath, you know, God counts us not obseruers of it, unless we see to it,
that our children and servants observe it also, Exodus 20. 11. Let no man say,
If I my self reverence Gods Sanctuary, it is no matter though I keep in my
house such as despise it. Abraham had been never the better, nor the more
assured of Gods blessing for serving God himself, if he had not commanded his
sons and his household after him to do so too, Genesis 18. 19. David vowed unto
God, that no deceitful person (that had a hollow heart toward Religion)
should dwell in his house, Psalm. 101. 7. Durst he then (think you) have kept
any that was an open despiser of Religion? Neither let any say, it is no matter
for children what behavior they use in the Church, though they prate or play,
or cry to the disturbance of the Congregation: for I tell you God cannot endure
profaneness or contempt of Religion, no not in children, as is plain by his
fearful judgment upon the children of Bethel, for scorning of his Prophet,
2. King. 2. 23, 24. Yea it stands us all upon to use the uttermost authority we
have, to maintain the reverence of Gods Sanctuary: for the open contempt done
by any, may bring Gods curse on us all; Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit
a trespass in the accursed thing, (says Phineas, Josh. 22. 20.) and wrath
fell on all the Congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his
iniquity. And certainly among other causes of the plague and other judgments
of God upon the land this is not the least, that Gods public worship is
performed amongst us with so little reverence and devotion as it is, for this
cause (says the Apostle, 1. Cor. 11. 30.) many are weak and sickly among you,
and many sleep.

Lecture the seven and twentieth, October 3. 1609.
WE have heard already out of the second general point that is to be observed
in this verse, viz. the question she mooues to our Savior, that the worship of
God is here called adoration, and from thence we were taught, That in all Gods
worship, not an inward devotion only of the soul, but an outward reverence of
the body is required. And the last day we began to deliver the use of the
Doctrine touching the necessity of outward reverence in the whole worship of
God, and heard first that it served for Exhortation, then for Reproof. The
Exhortation was that we should all learn to carry our selves reverently in all
the parts of Gods worship. And for our direction therein, I told you there were
rules given us in the Word, whereof some of them were general, and those were
five (which I delivered to you the last day) and some particular which direct
us how to carry our selves in every part of Gods public worship. And those I
am now to deliver unto you: let me entreat your attention and patience while I
finish this doctrine, the rather because it is not so pleasing I know unto the
ear as many other things that may be taught unto you.

But 1. It is a truth Christ has taught us in his Word, and whatsoever God is
pleased to teach, we must be content to hear. For thus says the Lord of
Christ, Ye shall hear him in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. Acts
3. 22.

2. It is a truth naturally arising out of this Text, and such as there be few
places in Scripture from which it may be so fitly delivered as from this.

3. It is a truth of continual use, and therefore we are bound to teach it, I
have kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, says the Apostle, Acts
20. 20. and if we be bound to teach it, you are bound to hear it also.

4. It is a truth you have not often heard; and my desire is to speak so fully
of it now, that I may not need to teach it again.

I told you the last day that there be six duties of Gods worship used in our
Assemblies, and all of them by the ordinance and commandment of the Lord. For
1. We pray togeher. 2. We hear the Word read. 3. We hear the Word preached.
4. We sing Psalms. 5. We have both the Sacraments administered. 6. We hear and
receive the blessing of God pronounced by his Minister. Now the Word of God
has given us particular direction how to carry our selves in every one of
these. For prayer we find three directions. 1. We should (if conveniently we
may) kneel at prayer. The fittest gesture in prayer, is kneeling: because we
have no gesture in use amongst us, so fit to express our humility by. For
this we have a plain commandment, to use it when we may, Psalm. 95. 6. Come
let us worship and fall down, and kneel before the Lord our maker. So Paul
taking his leave of the Elders of Ephesus, kneeled down and prayed with them
all. Act. 20. 36. And so all the Christians at Tyrus accompanying Paul to the
ship with their wives, and their children kneeled down on the shore and
prayed, Acts 21. 5. Yea we have the example of far greater persons for this,
namely of Solomon, 1. King. 8. 54. And of one that was greater then Solomon,
even out Savior himself, Luke 22. 41. 2. They that cannot conveniently
kneel, should stand, or at least do as much reverence with some other gesture
and posture of their body as they can. Some cannot conveniently kneel at
prayer, through age and other infirmities, and we know God preferres mercy
(even in this kind to our selves) before sacrifice, Matthew. 12. 7. Some by
reason of their Seats cannot kneel conveniently. If the Minister should
kneel at prayer in many Churches, the people could not hear him; no more
could many of them do if they should kneel down themselves at his prayers.
And edification should be more respected then gesture, or any other thing that
is but a matter of circumstance, the Apostle blames the neglect of this as a
chief fault in Gods public worship, 1. Cor. 14. 17. and professes, verse 19.
that himself had a chief respect unto this in all the parts of his Ministry;
and verse. 26. gives this charge to the Church concerning every thing that is to
be done in the Church Assemblies, Let all things be done to edifying. Such I
say as cannot conveniently kneel should either by standing, or by some other
gesture show as much bodily reverence as they can. For standing up at prayer,
we have direction, Nehemiah 9. 2. 5. Mark 11. 25. Luke 18. 13. And for the
bodily reverence that they should strive to show, that can neither kneel nor
stand up, we have old and weak Jacobs example, Genesis 47. 31. And Israel
worshipped or adored toward the beds head.

If it be objected that David sat at prayer, 2. Samuel 7. 18. I answer, the
word there used signifies as properly and usually to remain and abide in a
place, or at a thing, as to sit; as Genesis 27. 44. Leuiticus 14. 8. 1. Samuel
1. 22. and 20. 19. 2. Samuel 19. 32. in all which places the very same word is
used in the original tongue, and must be understood not of the gesture of
sitting, but of continuing and making some abode, as all the best translators
do render it. And so it is also to be taken and understood there. David
continued before the Lord. 3. All should with silence join in heart with the
Minister, and in their understanding and affection, go with him in his prayer,
and at the end of prayer witness their consent by saying Amen. And that this
is the part and duty of the people in public prayer, is evident both by the
example and direction of the Word in these places, 1. Chron. 16. 36. Nehemiah
8. 6. 1. Corinthians 14. 16.

2. At the hearing of the Word preached, all must attend and hearken
diligently, and our whole carriage must be such, as may no way hinder, but
stir up, and help our attention to that that is taught, Acts 8. 6. The
people gave heed to those things which Philip spoke with one accord. And we
are commanded to hearken diligently: Esaias 55. 2, 3. From day light till noone
the ears of all the people were attentive: Nehemiah 8. 3. and Proverbs 2. 2.
cause thine ears to hearken. Therefore it is noted to have been the use of
the people of God (for the help of their attention) to fasten their eyes upon
the Teacher: Luke 4. 20. and to keep their places: Nehemiah 8. 7. So that to
sleep at Sermon, or to talk, or to suffer the eyes to wander here and there,
or to read, (yea, though it be on the Bible, if we hinder our attention
thereby to that that is taught) argues want of reverence, and is a kind of
contempt done to Gods Ordinance. Job speaking of the reverence that men did
bear to him, says: Job 29. 9. When he spoke, the Princes stayed talk, and
laid their hand upon their mouth, and verse 21. unto me men gave ear, and
waited, and held their tongue at my counsel, and ver. 23. they waited for me
as for the rain. In this respect, writing, and taking notes at Sermons
(because: 1. It helps to keep the mind attentive to that that is taught. And
2. It helps the memory) is not unfit, how ever it be thought by some to be
some hinderance to the words working upon the affection in hearing.

3. At the hearing of the Word read, some further gesture and outward
signification of reverence is to be used, then is required at the hearing of
the Sermon. See a proof of this in the example of the Teacher: Luke 4. 16. Our
Savior when he read his Text, stood up to read; When he began his Sermon he
sat down: verse 20. See another proof of it in the example of the hearers:
Neh. 8. 5. When Ezra opened the book to read the Scriptures, all the people
stood up. But when they heard the Sermons, they were wont to sit, Ezekiel. 33. 31.
My people sit before thee and hear thy words.

If you ask what reason there is for this, seeing 1. The people of God do
(out of doubt) receive more profit and comfort by the Word preached, then by
the Word read: faith comes by hearing says the Apostle, Romans 10. 17. and 1.
Cor. 1. 21. it has pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save such
as do believe. 2. God works more mightily by the preaching of the Word, then
by the Word read: When Paul says, Romans 1. 16. That the Gospel is the power of
God unto salvation, what means he by the Gospel? surely the preaching of the
Gospel, as appears, verse. 15.

I answer, that though this be so, yet is the Word read in it self of far
greater excellency, authority, and certainety then the Sermon of any Preacher
in the world. For, 1. It comes more immediately from God: all Scripture is given
by inspiration of God, 2. Tim. 3. 16. And though it be translated by men, yet
is there in it far less mixture of humane ignorance, and infirmity, then in
preaching. While the Word is read, we are sure we hear God speaking unto us,
and that it is the truth that we hear: But not always so when man preaches,
for the best man is subject to error: Romans 3. 4. and 1. Cor. 13. 9. We know in
part, and prophecy in part. 2. The Word that is read, is the foundation of all
Sermons, and the very Touchstone whereby they are to be tried. To that which
we hear read, simple and absolute obedience is due, without any question made
of the truth and certainty of it, so is it not to that we hear preached,
further then we find it agreeable to the written Word: Acts 17. 11. They of
Berea are commended for examining that which the Apostles themselves did teach.
And a commandment is given us: 1 Thessalonians. 5. 11. to prove that we hear, and
comparing that with verse 20. it is plain that in doing so, we show no
contempt to our Teachers. So you see the custom of our Churches in sitting
bare, while the Word is read, is grounded upon good reason and warrant from the
Word of God, and such as it well becomes every one of Gods people to conform
themselves unto.

4. I have been long in directing what outward behavior should be in these
three exercises. In the three following I will be the briefer. In singing of
Psalms; though we should respect the matter more, then the Tune, or Music,
and use the Tune only as a means to stir up, and increase good meditations
and affections in our souls, Col. 3. 16. Teaching and admonishing one another,
in Psalms, and Hymns, and spiritual Songs. Yet is there (for the reverence
of this part of Gods worship, due respect also to be had of keeping the Tune.
And as they show contempt to the ordinance of God that sit mute and join not
with the Congregation in it, so do they also, that by not keeping the Tune,
do disturb and breed confusion in the Congregation. It is said of those that
sung in the Temple, that they sung as if they had been all but one man, making
one sound to be heard in praising the Lord. 2. Chron. 5. 13.

5. In the time that either of the Sacraments are administered, we have partly
learned how we should behave our selves by that which we have already heard.
For in the administration of both the Sacraments the greatest part of the time
is spent in prayer, and in reading of the Word, and in singing of Psalms. But
besides all this that has been said, this one direction is peculiar to the
Sacraments, that we must use the help of our eye, and behold that which is
done in the Administration of the Sacraments, we must be hold when the Water is
applied, the Bread broken, the Wine powered out and given. In the other parts of
Gods service, the Lord teaches, and helps our edification, by the use of our
ear, in this by the use of our eye also. In which respect also the Sacrament
is called a visible word. When Moses took the blood of the Sacrifice and
sprinkled it upon the people, he bad them behold the blood of the covenant
which the Lord made with them: Exodus 24. 8.

6. When the blessing is pronounced by the Minister of Christ, at the end of
Gods public worship, and dismissing the Congregation. The people (in reverence
to the Lord whose blessing they are to receive thereby) should stand up. When
Solomon (who in that was more then a King) blessed the Congregation of Israel,
it is precisely noted by the Holy Ghost, that the gesture the people used while
Solomon gave the blessing, was standing, 1. King. 8. 14. 2. Chron. 6. (...).
and all the Congregation of Israel did stand. Thus have I finished the first
Use of this Doctrine, touching the outward reverence due to the Sanctuary, and
given you directions out of Gods Word, how yo^ should carry your selves in his
public worship.

Lecture the eight and twentieth, October. 10. 1609.
IT remains now that I come to the second Use, and that is for reproof of
such as bear no reverence, but show open contempt to the public Use 2.
worship of God. And I find three principal faults in this kind. 1. The
neglect that is had of the place it self where our Church assemblies are kept,
I mean of our Churches and Temples. 2. The refusing to be present, and to
join with the assembly in Gods worship. 3. The vnreuerent behavior and
contempt that is done to Gods worship by them that use to be present at it.

1. It is a sin and contempt done to Gods public worship, when our Churches
are spoiled and defaced. The Prophet complaining of the enemies of Gods people,
Psalm 74. 10. that they did blaspheme Gods name, that they blasphemed and
reproched the Lord, verse 18. he gives this for one reason of it, verse 8. that
they burnt up the Synagognes of God. Yea it is a sin and contempt done to
Gods worship, when there is not care had that they be decently and comely kept
and maintained. I have already granted that it has been the folly and
superstition of the Papists to think, that Lect. 26.
their Temples could never be (for the building and furniture) stately and
glorious enough. And if any shall object for their superstition, the glory and
stateliness of Salomons Temple. I answer, the comparison and proportion will
not hold between that Temple and ours, but between the Synagogues that the
Jews had and our Churches. By reason of three notable differences that are (as
I then showed you) between the Temple at Jerusalem and our Temples; yet may we
truly say, that as superstition made the Papists too careful and bountiful,
so profaneness and Atheism has made us too void of care herein. The dust and
cobwebs where with the seats and Pulpits, and walls of our Churches in most
places are hung, the small reparations that are made of them, do proclaim
su^iciently to God and men, how small reverence we bear unto the Sanctuary and
worship of God. It is a foul sin and contempt done to Gods worship, that
Parishioners either will not be at charge to maintain such as may keep the
Church decently, or (if they be willing to be at that charge, yet) are
altogether careless to see it done, to see that such as they maintain to this
purpose do their office. David thought it unfit (though he were a King) that
his own house should be more handsome then the House of God, 2. Sam. 7. 2. And
though the Lord would not let him build him an house, yet he commends his
affection for it. Thou did well (says he, 2. Chron. 6. 8.) that thou were so
minded. But with us every mean man's house is more handsome and better kept,
then the House of God: yea the barnes and stables of many men, are better kept
then their Churches are. When the Tabernacle of the Congregation was to be
built, the people of all sorts, rich and poor, men and women contributed so
bountifully and readily toward it, that Moses was feign to make a Proclamation
that they should bring no more. Exodus 36. 6. I warrant you, there needs no such
Proclamation now adays. Every man grudges to give two pence a year toward
the repairing of the House of God. The cause that moved David to be at such
cost in preparing for the building of the Temple was this (as himself tells
us, 1. Chron. 29. 3.) because He had a delight in the House of his God. And the
true cause then why we now a days will be at no cost with Gods House, is
because we have no delight in the House of God. David rejoiced greatly, and
praised God for the zeal and willingness that he saw in the people to
contribute toward the building of the Temple, because he knew God was highly
pleased with it, and would bless them for it, 1. Chron. 29. 9, 10. And it must
needs then be a just cause of grief to every godly man to see the
irreligiousnesse of the people now adays, and how extremely careless they
are of the House of God; because he cannot but know, that God must needs be
highly offended with the people, and plague them for this sin. And so we
find that the Prophet speaking of a curse that was laid upon the Jews in
their substance and labor, Hag. 1. 6. He gives this for the chief reason of
it, that themselves dwelt in seeled houses and suffered the House of God to lie
wast, Hag. 1. 4.

The second kind of contempt done to Gods public worship, is the refusing to
be present, and join with the assembly in the worship of God And I find three
sorts guilty of this sin.

The first are they, that do ordinarily (without any just or necessary
occasion) absent themselves from the assembly, keep their beds, or their
shops, or the alse-house when they should be here. I know these men will be
ready to say, our Preachers are proud, they would have all men to hear them,
they take it in great budgin if one be away when they preach; and it is no
marvel sure, for what good shall we get by hearing of them? If such or such
eloquent learned famous men did preach, we would give them the hearing. To
these men I say first, be not deceived, there is none of us so simple as to be
proud of such hearers as you be. Can a Preacher think you be proud to see
drunkards, or whoremongers, or blasphemers, or profane fools that scorn all
goodness to come and hear him? Surely as much as Ezechiel was, when the Lord
told him, Ezekiel. 2. 3. 5. I send thee to the house of Israel, and thou shall say
unto them, thus says the Lord. But surely they will not hear for they are a
rebellious house; and see what comfort he took in such hearers, Ezekiel. 3. 14.
he went in the bitterness of his spirit to preach unto such men No, no, we
glory not at all to have our ministry frequented by some men; but there are
many, that we are glad to see that they keep themselves away, and sorry at the
heart when we see them come into the Church; as it may seem John was, when he
saw the Pharisees and Sadduces come to hear him, a generation of Vipers (says
he, Matthew. 3 7.) who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come? as if he
should have said, who brought you hither, what do you here?

But 2. let me tell thee, thou might receive profit (if the fault be not in
thy self) by the meanest of us that preach, at least more then thou can do
in thy bed, shop, or alehouse.

3. If thou were sure thou could not profit yet must thou come to do thy
homage to God, and show thy reverence to his ordinance, give unto the Lord the
glory due unto his name (says the royal Prophet, 1. Chron. 16. 29.) bring an
offering and come before him; worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness, thou
denyest to give to God the glory due unto his name, if thou neglect to come
before him, and to worship him in his Sanctuary. We do not require you to come
to do any duty or homage therein unto us, but unto God, and if (in refusing to
come) you did but discountenance, disgrace, and show your contempt to us, then
the matter were not great; but thou will find one day, that by this wilful
absenting of thy self, thou have discountenanced and disgraced the ordinance
and worship of God, and so despised and showed contempt to the Lord himself.
Thou shall one day find that Christ will make that good upon thy soul which
he has said, Luke 10. 16. He that hears you, hears me, and he that
despises you despises me, and he that despises me, despises him that sent
me: and can that seem unto thee a small matter?

The second sort that offend in refusing to be present at Gods public worship
are they that prefer the service that is done to God in a Chapel or private
chamber before that that is done in the public assembly. True it is (and no
man may deny but) it may be lawful to have all the parts of Gods public
worship used in a private Chapel, or for want thereof in a chamber. For
preaching of the Word, we have a plain warrant in the example of the Apostles
who used to preach in houses sometimes, even then when they had liberty to
preach in the Temple, Acts 5. 42. Yea the Sacraments (which are the most
solemn parts of Gods worship) may also sometimes be lawfully administered in a
family, namely when 1. Either through persecution the doors of Gods House are
shut against us, and we cannot be permitted to receive them in the Congregation
according to Christ's ordinance, or 2. When a family is of it self a competent
and distinct Congregation, and such as uses to join together in all parts of
Gods public worship without offense to Church-gouernement. For so we read of
Baptism administered in Cornelius house, Acts 10. 44. 47. and the Communion in
a chamber at Tr^as, Acts 20. 8. But the most solemn and public, and best
frequented assemblies of Gods people, are much fitter places for Gods public
worship, then any private Chappells or Chambers, and to be preferred before
them. And for any (through niceness, or idleness, or out of disdain to join
with the base multitude) to neglect the Church Assemblies, and to rest in their
domestical devotions, is a great sin. See what account the godly made of the
public assembly, and what an adventure they made for it, and that even in such
a duty, as they might have performed in private, namely in prayer, Acts 16. 13.
Nay see what account our Savior himself made of the public assembly, Luke 4.
16. his custom was (even before he was a Preacher) to frequent the Synagogue
every Sabbath day.

Three Reasons there be why all men should prefer the worship that is done in
most public assemblies, before that that is done in more private places.

1. The respect of our own good: for we may look for a greater blessing from
God upon his ordinances in the public assemblies then in more 1.
private meetings. Even to our Church assemblies that may be applied that we
read, Psalm. 87. 2. The Lord loves the gates of Zion above all the habitations
of Jacob, Matthew. 7. 7. Prayer is compared to seeking of a thing that is lost,
and to knocking at a gate we desire to enter into. And when many seek a thing,
there is more hope of finding it, when many knock at heaven gates they will be
the better heard. Therefore when Gods people have showed more then ordinary
desire to prevail with God in their prayers they have showed more then
ordinary care that the assemblies might be as public as might be, Joel 2. 15.
Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, verse 16.
Gather the people, assemble the children, etc. as if he should say, leave none
out. Iehosaphat, 2. Chron. 20. 3. proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah, verse
13. All Judah stood before the Lord with their young ones, wives and children,
and Judge. 20. 20. Then all the children of Israel went up, and all the people
came also into the House of God, and till then they prevailed not. That is the
reason also why Hezechias was so careful to gather such a solemn assembly to
keep the Passover, 2. Chron. 30. 1, 2.

2. The respect we should have to the good of others, for we may much benefit
others by our good example. David professed he received much 2.
good by beholding the forwardness of his people in going to the House of God,
Psalm. 122. 1, 2. How much more good, will the example of great men do of the
multitude, when they are such diligent frequenters of Gods worship. That is the
reason why the Lord would have the Prince not only to join with Gods people
in his service, but to be in the midst of them, that they might all see him,
Ezekiel. 46. 10. It is said that the scaffold Solomon made for himself in the
Temple, was in the midst of the Court, so as all the people might see him, 2.
Chron. 6. 12, 13. And of King Ioash it is said, that so soon as ever Athalia
came into the Temple, she saw the King stand by the piliar as the manner was,
2. King. 11. 14. So it is also said of Iosia, 2. King. 23. 3. By which three
examples it is plain that the Kings seat was so set in the Temple, that all
might see him there.

3. The respect we should have to the honor of God, for the more public the
assembly is wherein we worship God, the more public is the profession 3.
which we make of the homage and duty that we owe unto him. Therefore it is
required, Psalm 29. 12. of great men to worship the Lord in the Sanctuary,
that so they might give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name. That is the
reason why David vowed he would give thanks to the Lord in a great
Congregation, and praise him among much people, Psalm. 35. 18. And Hezekiah
resolved to go up to the House of the Lord the third day so soon as ever he
was recovered, 2. Kings 20. 8. And David professed that it had been one of the
chief comforts he had in the world, that he had been wont to go with the
multitude to lead them to the House of God, Psalm 42. 4.

Lecture the nine and twentieth, October 17. 1609.
THe third sort that offend in refusing to be present at Gods public worship,
are such as make no conscience to come to the beginning of it, and to stay to
the end of it. I condemn not all, that sometimes come after the beginning, nor
all that sometimes go out before the end; but them that do this ordinarily,
them that make no conscience of this, I condemn; nay the Doctrine that I have
taught you out of Gods Word (concerning the outward reverence that we owe to
Gods public worship) condemns such. And because I see many of them that have
most knowledge, and are forwardest professors offend this way, I will manifest
the sin of these men in three several respects and considerations.

1. They sin against themselves, and they hinder themselves of the profit
they might receive by the worship of God. For as he that is away from 1.
any part of the Sermon, shall profit the less by that which he does hear (if
he come after it is begun, or go away before it be ended) So is there no one
part of Gods service (not the confession, not the prayers, not the Psalm, not
the blessing) but it concerns every one; and even one may receive edification
by it, as I proved to you at large, not long since. Besides, it would be a
great help to men's profiting by Gods service, if they would not rush suddenly
into it, out of their worldly business, or worldly and profane talk, but
come so into Gods House, that they may have some time to set their hearts in
tune, and lay aside all worldly thoughts before Gods service do begin. This is
that, that was signified by that ceremony which God enjoined Moses, Exodus 3. 5.
Put off thy shoes, for the place whereon thou stand is holy ground. The
promise that is made to our prayers, runs thus, Job 11. 13. If thou prepare
thine heart, and stretch out thine hands unto him: the stretching out of our
hands (or of our voice either) is to little purpose, if our heart be not
prepared first. If we could say before every part of Gods service, as David
did, Psalm. 57. 7. My heart is prepared O my God, my heart is prepared, I will
sing and give praise; doubtless we should find more comfort and edification
thereby then we do.

2. They sin against the Congregation and hinder the profit, and edification of
others. One chief cause (doubtless) why so many offend this way, 2.
is because they see such and such, that are their betters, and have more
knowledge then they, use to do so. In so much, as let us teach men their duty
in this never so plainly, out of Gods Word, we shall never be able to reform
many, till some of you give better example. When the people answered Jeremy so
desperately, the word that thou have spoken unto us in the name of the Lord, we
will not hear it of thee, Ier. 44. 16. The reason is given, verse. 17. that
they had the example of their Fathers, and Princes, and husbands, to justify
that they did. Besides many coming so late, give occasion of distraction, and
drawing away the minds of others, from that part of Gods service, that is in
hand. And this may seem to be one reason, why there is such a special charge
given to the Prince (above others) that he shall neither come into Gods House,
after the people are assembled, nor go out before them, Ezekiel. 46. 10. Because,
if he should come or go by them, while they are at any part of Gods service,
(though it be while they are upon their knees at prayer unto God) they would be
ready to leave the service of God, and rise up to do reverence to the Prince,
how unfit soever it be for them to do so.

3. They sin against the worship of God it self, For as the forwardness in
coming betimes to Gods service, argues our reverence 3.
we bear to it, and delight we take in it; so our coming so late, must needs
argue the contrary. It Is noted for a property of Gods people, that they came
willingly at the time of the assembly, Psalm. 110. 3. And the Holy Ghost speaks
it to the praise of Hezekiah, 2. Chron. 29. 20. that upon the day, that he was
to do public worship in the House of God, he rose early. Certainly by this
example we should learn, that they that cannot in a short time be ready to
come to Gods House, but have much to do in the morning, they should rise
earlier on the Sabbath, and on such days of public exercise, then on other
days, 2. Chron. 29. 36. It is said to have been a great comfort to Hezekiah
to see, with what readiness and forwardness the people came to the House of
God. And as that was so to him, so on the contrary, it is a just cause of
complaint, and grief to the godly, to see the backwardness of the people now
adays in coming to Gods House. Besides, look what part of Gods service, we
refuse to yield our presence to, to that we do a contempt, and show abase
estimation we have of it. And in esteeming basely of the least part of Gods
service, used in the Congregation, we show contempt to God. For there is
nothing done in our assemblies, but by his ordinance, as I have proved to you
at large not long since. So that I may conclude as, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 8. He that
despises these things, despises not man, but God.

If any man shall say, though this be a fault, it is but a small fault, and
therefore it is no great matter, though he use it still, notwithstanding all
this, I have said against it. I would wish him to consider these five points.

1. That he that gives himself liberty wittingly and willingly to continue in
the least sin, has obtained the pardon of no sin: James 2. 10. He that keeps
the whole Law, and fails in one point, is guilty of all.

2. This is a sin against the first Table, that immediately concerns God
himself, and therefore cannot be a small sin: Matthew. 22. 28. The first is
called the first and great command meant.

3. It is a public and scandalous sin, and no sins that are public and
scandalous unto others, can be small sins. The Lord gives this as a reason,
why he so sharply punished Moses and Aaron, for not believing his promise (of
giving water out of the rock) because it was in the presence of the children
of Israel, that they showed this infidelity: Number. 20. 12. It was a public and
a scandalous sin.

4. Though it seem a small sin to come after the beginning of Gods service,
and go before it be ended, yet the root from whence this grows, is a
despising, and an vnreuerent estimation of Gods ordinance, (as I have already
proved) and that is no small sin. The Lord when he would make known to
David the heinousness of his sin, calls him to the consideration of this
bitter root, from whence it grew: 2. Sam. 12. 10. The sword shall never depart
from thine house, because thou have despised me and taken the wife of Vriah.

5. Though this sin were small, when you committed it of ignorance, it cannot
be small, now it is thus revealed to you by the Word, to be a sin, and you
shall commit it against knowledge, James 4. 17. To him that knows how to do
well, and does it not, to him it is a sin, with a witness as we say: 1. Sam.
15. 23. Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and disobedience or repugnancy
to the will of God, is wickedness and Idolatry.

3. The third and last sin, that I told you was to be reproved by the
Doctrine, is the vnreuerent behavior and contempt that is done to Gods
worship, by them that use to be present at it. Three sorts of people I find
that are to be blamed in this kind. 1. Such as admit to all the privileges of
the Church, them that are scandalously profane and wicked men. 2. Such as 1.
join with us in Gods service, and show not the outward reverence that
becomes 2.
them in it. 3. Such as being present, do show themselves openly profane, and
contemners of Gods Sanctuary and service. 3.


1. It is a great contempt done to Gods public worship, when all without
difference, are admitted to the privileges of the Church, as if they had
equal interest in them with the people of God. When such as are known to the
Congregation to have committed whoredom, have their children instantly
admitted to Baptism, (no necessity on the infants part requiring have) before
themselves have given satisfaction to the Congregation by their repentance:
when such as are known to the Congregation to be ignorant, malicious,
unclean, unjust persons, drunkards, and blasphemers, are admitted to the Table
of the Lord: when the House of God is made as a common Inn, that receives
guests of all sorts to come into it, and entertaines all alike. The gates of
Gods House are called the gates of righteousness: none should presume to enter
into them, but such (as in profession and endeavor) are righteous men, Psalm
118. 19. 20. Open ye unto me (says David) the gates of righteousness, that I
may go into them, and praise the Lord. This is the gate of the Lord, the
righteous shall enter into it. They had therefore under the Law, by Gods
appointment, at the time of the assemblies, certain Levites that were Porters
set by the gates of the House of the Lord, that none that was unclean in any
thing should enter in: 2. Chron. 23. 19. And you shall see what diligence was
enjoined them in their office: 2. Chron. 35. 15. The Porters waited at every
gate, and might not depart from their service. And has God less care of his
service under the Gospel, then he had under the Law? John admitted none to
Baptism, but such as made profession of their repentance. Matthew. 3. 6. And may
we admit such now (for children now are admitted in their parents right) as are
known to have begotten those children in whoredom, that they bring to
Baptism, and profess not repentance? None that had any legal uncleanness
upon them, might eat the Passover, Number. 9. 6. And it is said that Ezra had
none to join with him in the Passover, but such only, as had separated
themselves from the filthiness of the Heathen, and joined themselves to Gods
people to seek the Lord God of Israel, Ezra 6. 21. And may we admit to our
Passover, such as separate themselves from no filthiness nor seek at all to
know and please the Lord?

Three great evils there are that come of this. 1. Occasion is given to the
weak to mislike our Religion. This is one principal cause that has made our
assemblies and worship so contemptible, and odious to the Brownists, and caused
them to separate from us, and to make so fearful a schism, and rent in the
Church; (I excuse them not in it; I know they sin grievously) but I say in this
case as our Savior does, Matthew. 18. 7. Woe be to the world because of
offenses; Woe be to the Brownists that take this offense; but withal I say, as
Christ says there: Woe be to the man by whom the offense comes; and as the
Holy Ghost speaks of the sin of Elies sons, so speak I of the sin of
these men, 1. Sam. 2. 17. The sin of the young men was very great before the
Lord; for men abhord the offerings of the Lord. Did the people well to abhor
the offerings of the Lord? No verily, it was the peoples sin so to do, as you
shall find verse. 24. But yet the sin of Elies sons was very great before
the Lord; because they gave the people occasion so to do.

2. The blessing we might otherwise receive from God in our Church Assemblies,
is greatly hindered thereby. The Lord (out of the care he has of his Vineyard)
has taken order, 1. That it should have an hedge and fence about it, and not
lie open to every beast that would come in. 2. That the stones (that might
hinder the fruitfulness of it) might be gathered out of it. 3. That there
should be a Watchtower even in the midst of it, Esaias 5. 2. And one chief
cause (doubtless) why the Lords Vineyard among us is no more fruitful then it
is, is this, that it wants this fence, it lies open, the stones are not
gathered out of it; either we have not any Watchtower in the midst of it or
(if we have) there is no body in the Tower to watch, who comes to pluck and
gather, who comes to spoil and devour the Lords grapes.

3. The holy things of God are profaned thereby. The Lord complains by his
Prophet, Ezekiel. 22. 26. That the Priests of Judah had defiled his holy things,
and he was profaned amongst them; and gives this for the reason: They put no
difference betwixt the holy and profane, neither discern between the clean
and the unclean. And the Apostle tells the Corinthians, that if they did not
put the incestuous person from among them, but were so remiss, in exercising
the censures of the Church, the whole Congregation would be endangered thereby,
1. Cor. 5. 6. Know ye not (says he) that a little leaven leaueneth the whole
lump. This is a chief cause of the marvelous increase of drunkenesse,
uncleanness, and profaneness in most places; that infamous sinners are thus
admitted to the privileges of the Church. I say more, this extreme
profanation of Gods ordinances amongst us, may give us all just cause of
fear, that God will deprive us of them; and of this gracious liberty in his
worship and service, that we do enjoy, and say of us ere long, as he said of
his ancient people, not long before their captivity, Ier. 11. 15, What has my
beloved to do within mine house?

2. The second sort of them that I told you were to be charged with this third
and last sin, are such as join with us in Gods service, and show not the
outward reverence in it, that becomes them. Of this sort there are very many.

1. Some attend not to the worship of God, that is in hand though they be
present at it. It is a sin and a disorder (I say not to sleep or talk at
any part of Gods service; for they that are blind, may discern the sin of
such as do so) but even to be busied in any action (that is otherwise good
and holy) if thereby we be hindered from attending to the public worship of
God. The reading of our Bibles, or turning to the places that are alleged (if
thereby we be hindered from attending) is a sin. The Noble men of
Thessalonica, while they heard, received the Word with all readiness, and
(afterward) daily searched the Scriptures, Acts 17. 11. To be at our private
prayer, while any public part of Gods worship is in hand (because it draws
away our mind from the public worship which is to be preferred before the
private) is a disorder certainly, and some degree of contempt done to Gods
public worship.

2. Some will not vouchsafe to be bare at the reading of the Word; some will be
bare at the Psalms, not at the Chapters. And if they could justly pretend
infirmity for it, they were to be excused, But they will not be bare many of
them, so long as the Text is in reading; yea every youth and boy in our
Congregations, are wont to be covered while the Word is read.

3. But the chief abuse in this kind, is the neglect of kneeling in prayer;
many that will kneel at their own private prayers (which they make at their
coming into the Church) can never be seen to kneel at the common and public
prayers. 2. Many that will kneel at the Lords prayer, will kneel at no other;
whereas (though the Lords prayer be in sundry respects more excellent then any
other; yet) there is as much reason we should kneel at any other prayer, as at
it. For the reason of our kneeling, is not the excellency of the words that
are used in prayer, but the reverence and duty we owe to the person we pray
unto. 3. Some use not to kneel at any prayer; though they use kneeling in a
buttery or a seller, or alehouse, in drinking of healths, they can never be
seen to kneel in the House of God in prayer to him. I know what men pretend
for this; if the person to whose health they drink be such as to whom (in the
civil custom of our country) the knee is due, it cannot be (say they)
unlawful, and unfit in drinking to their health to kneel down. But (how
witty soever these men be to excuse their sin) it is certain, this use was
first taken up in scorn and contempt of prayer. And therefore it is not to be
marvelled, if they that have thus abused their knee in doing homage to the
devil, be so void of grace as never to bow their knee to the honor and
service of God. But let them that use so often to drink healths upon their
knees, consider what they will answer to the Lord for so great profaneness.

3. The third and last sort of them that I told you are to be charged with this
sin (of not showing due reverence to Gods worship when they are 3.
present at it) are they, that though they will come sometimes to the House of
God, (specially if they have the example of their betters to draw them unto it)
yet carry themselves so, as if they did study to show that they despise our
assemblies, and the worship we do to God in them. As many Papists that are
present when we give thanks to God in our meals, will by some outward
behavior witness their dislike, so do these men, (being in heart either
Papists, or Atheists which is worse) carry themselves in our public
assemblies. By prating, and laughing, and playing the parts of iesters, and
profane fools, they do purposely both hinder themselves, and all that are
near unto them, from profiting by any thing that is taught; yea endeavor all
they can to make the Word and service of God ridiculous and contemptible unto
others. Surely, the sin of these men is exceeding great before the Lord. Our
Savior calls these despisers and scorners of holy things dogs. Matthew. 7. 6.
When the Holy Ghost would show that Nimrod was an oppressor in high contempt of
God, he calls him, A mighty hunter before the Lord. Genesis 10. 9. And surely
these that dare be thus profane even in the place of Gods special presence
(before the Lord) may well be said to be profane in the highest degree,
profane in high contempt to God himself. It were to be wished such men would
keep themselves away from Gods Sanctuary; or that we had such porters to keep
them away as they had under the law, 2. Chron. 23. 19. For they do enough to
bring Gods vengeance on us all by their sin.

But to conclude I will say to these men (though I hope there be none such
here, and if there were, I have small hope to do them good, as the Apostle
does) 1. Cor. 10. 22. Do you provoke the Lord unto anger; are you greater then
he? Ier. 7. 19. Do they provoke me to anger says the Lord, do they not
provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces? Did thou never feel
the terror of the Lord? Did the fear of his glorious power and majesty never
strike thine heart, and make it to tremble? How have thou been affected in the
thunder and lightning this last summer? If thou have, let this restrain thee
from this profaneness, and teach thee to adore and do him reverence
specially in his Sanctuary. See how this reason is urged by the Prophet. Psalm.
29. when he had exhorted the greatest, verse 2. to give unto the Lord the glory
due unto his name, which they could never do unless they did worship and adore
him in his glorious Sanctuary; he speaks much, verse. 3. -- 9. (as an
effectual reason to move them to it) of the glory, and greatness, and power
of God that appears in the thunder and lightning; and verse. 9. concludes his
speech, in it thus and in his temple does every one speak of his glory, as if
he should say, in his temple his glory appears much more then in that; and the
greatness and glory of God that appears in that, makes men give the more
glory to God in his Sanctuary, and show the more reverence in it.

Lecture the thirtieth, October 24. 1609.
IT remains now that we come to the question it self, which this woman
propounds to our Savior, wherein (that we may the better receive our
instruction from it) these three things are to be observed.

1. That (perceiving him to be a Prophet, and one that could tell secrets) she
sought not to know her fortune (as we say) how long she should live, how many
more husbands she should have; or how many children, what manner of ones they
would prove, or such like matters; which (if she would have yielded to that
curiosity, that is in us all by nature) she would have questioned with him
about; but (being effectually touched in conscience by the Spirit of God with
remorse for her sin, and desire of salvation) she seeks only to be instructed
by him in a chief ground of Religion, and case of conscience.

2. Though she were but a woman, and a Samaritan, and an harlot, yet did she
take notice of a maine controversy, that was between the Jews, and
Samaritans about the right way to salvation, and true manner of serving God,
yea she was acquainted also with the chief reason, that the Samaritans
alleged for themselves.

3. She satisfies not her conscience in the long custom of all her neighbors
and antiquity of their Religion: neither fears the imputation of lightness
and inconstancy amongst her neighbors; but calls in question the Religion
which her self and all her ancestors had profe^ed, and earnestly desires to be
resolved by Christ, whether it were the true Religion or no. And from this
example thus considered, we have this Doctrine to learn for our instruction:
that

Every Christian, even women are bound to seek to be resolved, and settled in
the knowledge of the true Religion of God. Before I come to the Doct. 5.
proof of this, two things are to be premised for the right understanding of
the Doctrine.

1. I do not say that every one is bound to study the controversies, so as to
be able to answer an adversary. For this is a special gift required of the
Minister to be able to convince the Adversary, Tit. 1. 9. And to stop his
mouth, verse 11. Yea it may do hurt to a weak Christian, to busy himself
much with controversies, to read the books of adversaries to the truth, or
confer with them, Romans 14. 1. Him that is weak in the faith, receive, but
not for controversies in disputation.

2. I say not that there is the like measure of knowledge required of every
Christian. For 1. Of us that live in these days (in which the light is so
clearly revealed, in which, besides the Ministry of the Word, there are books
of all sorts written) more knowledge is required, th^n was of our forefathers.
2. Of such as live under better means of instruction, more is required, then
of such as live under a dumb and ignorant Ministry. The Apostle sharply
reprooues the Hebrews, Chap. 5 12. for that (whereas considering the time they
lived in, and means they had inioyed, they ought to have been teachers, yet
had need to be taught their first principles: and tells them, Heb. 6. 1. 3.
That unless they were careful to grow forward to perfection, they were in
great danger to fall into the unpardonable sin. 3. Of such as have more
leisure, and fewer distractions through worldly business, God requires a
greater measure of knowledge then of others. That which the Apostle speaks of
unmarried persons, holds good proportion with Gentlemen and others, that (by
reason of their estates) are freed from that toil in worldly business that
others have, 1. Cor. 7. 32. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord,
how he may please the Lord, verse 33. He that is married cares for the things
of the world. 4. Of such as God has given best natural parts, best wits, and
best memories unto, he requires more knowledge then of others. For that speech
of Christ is general; To whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much
required, Luke 12. 48.

Yet remains the Doctrine true, that every Christian (of what sex and
condition soever) is bound to seek to be resolved and settled in the knowledge
of the true Religion of God. Observe the confirmation of this Doctrine in three
several points.

1. Every one is bound to seek the knowledge of the truth: 1. Tim. 2. 4. God
would have all men (all sorts) to be saved; but how? and to come to the
knowledge of the truth. Though the Lord be infinite in mercy, yet they can have
no comfort in his mercy, that have no knowledge: Esaias 27. 11. It is a people of
no understanding, therefore he that has made them, shall have no compassion of
them, and he that formed them, shall have no mercy on them: Say a man lead an
honest and virtuous life, that will not serve his turn, without knowledge: 2.
Pet. 1. 5. Join to your virtue knowledge: Say a man has a good meaning, and
be devout and careful to please God; this will do him no good without
knowledge: Romans 10. 2. The Jews had the zeal of God, but it was not according
to knowledge; and therefore for all their zeal the wrath of God came on them
to the utmost: 1 Thessalonians. 2. 16.

2. No man is to content himself with some smattring, or small measure of
knowledge, but every one is bound to seek for certainety, and to have a sound
judgment, and settled resolution in the matters of his Religion. Romans 14. 5.
Let every man be fully persuaded in his mind, that he may be able to say, as,
Romans 14. 14. I know and am persuaded through the Lord Jesus. And Paul's prayer
to God for the Colossians was (and if he desired it for them, they were bound
to desire it for themselves) that they might know the mysteries of Religion in
all riches of the full assurance of understanding, Coloss. 2. 2. and verse 7.
requires, that they would seek to be rooted, and established in the faith.
And Peter reports of all the faithful he wrote to, that they had knowledge and
were stablished in the present truth. 2. Pet. 1. 12. And 2. Pet. 3. 17. Beware
least ye fall from your own steadfastness; verse 18. but grow in grace and in
the knowledge of our Lord. And Paul tells the Colossians: Chap. 1. 22, 23. That
Christ will present them holy and unblameable unto God, if they continue in the
faith, grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the
Gospel. Though it be not required of every Christian to be able to answer
every thing that is objected, yet should he be, propositi tenax, so sure of
that truth, which he has learned out of Gods Word, that nothing that is
objected by any adversary, may draw him from it: 1. Cor. 2. 15. He that is
spiritual discerns all things, and he is judged of no man: Insomuch, as
though the learned man in the world, yea an Angel from heaven should object
against it, yet he would not yield to him, Gal. 1. 8. 9. In this respect the
faithful man is compared to a tree that grows by the rivers of water, and is
well rooted. But the hypocrite to the chafe, Psalm. 1. 3, 4.

3. Every one that has means is bound so far forth to take notice of the
controversies of Religion, as may serve for the settling of his own heart in
the truth. 1. Cor. 14. 20. Brethren, be not children in understanding, but of
a ripe age: Phil. 1. 9, 10. And this, I pray, that your love may abound yet
more and more in knowledge, and in all judgment, and verse 11. that you may
allow those things that are best that you may be pure and without offense
until the day of Christ. It is the commandment of God to his people, Ier. 6.
16. that they would stand in the ways, and behold, and ask for the old way,
which is the good way. When a man sees, there are diverse ways, and broad
ones too, it is not good to go on carelessely, but he should stand still, and
consider, and behold, which is the likelier way, and ask of such as can direct
him. It would be a good confirmation to a Christian (that has means to direct
him) to compare the Doctrine of Papists with ours, and the weak grounds they
have to build upon.

1. Our Religion is our chief inheritance, Psalm. 119. 111. and our glory:
Reason.
Psalm. 4. 2. Every one seeks certainty in his inheritance, if he see any hole
in his lease, or evidence, he will give no rest to himself, nor spare cost,
till he have made it sure.

2. It is necessary to the salvation of every man, that he profess the true
Religion, and be a member of the true Church. For out of the true Church and
Religion, no man can find assurance of salvation and comfort. See the
necessity of this profession: Romans 10. 10. With the mouth man confesses to
salvation, Isay 44. 5. One shall say, I am the Lords, another shall be called
by the name of Jacob: another shall subscribe with his hand to the Lord, and
surname himself by the name of Israel. Mark how the profession of the true
Religion, yea, the very hope of salvation, and joining to the true Church, go
together. So Noah desiring the salvation of Iaphets posterity, prays that God
would persuade Iaphet to dwell in the tents of Sem: Genesis 9. 27. And 2. Chron.
11. 16. All such as set their hearts to seek God, came to Jerusalem. So it is
said, God added to the Church such as should be saved: Acts 2. 47. And it was
David's comfort and glory, that he was the son of Gods handmaid, Psalm. 116.
16. As if he should not else have been Gods servant. Therefore the true
Religion and Church is called often the Kingdom of heaven: Matthew. 13. 44. 47.
And that promise that is made: Esaias 33. 24. (the people that dwell there shall
have their sins forgiven) though it be to be understood of the Church
Catholic, as it is in our Creed, and not of any particular visible Church,
Yet may it thus far forth be applied to the Church visible, as that a man may
say boldly, none can ordinarily attain to salvation, that is not a member of
the true visible Church. Now there is but one true Church and Religion: there
may be in matters of less moment, sundry differences in the true Church (as
between us and the Lutherans, and Brownists, and among our selves) but these
make us not several Churches: because in the fundamental points of Religion,
(the knowledge whereof is absolutely necessary to salvation, and the profession
whereof makes a true Christian) we all agree. It is a damnable conceit of
some, that a man may be saved in any Religion. There is but one faith: Ephesians.
4. 5. one way to life, and one gate. Matthew. 7. 13. Gods promise is to all his
Elect, that he will give them one heart, and one way: Ier. 32. 39. It stands
men therefore upon to enquire diligently which is the only true Church, which
is the only true Religion.

3. Such as are not well grounded in Religion, and careful to attain to
certainty and resolution in it, are in continual danger to be seduced, and to
fall from their profession, either on the right hand or on the left. The
Apostle gives the reason why he desired the Colossians might attain to all
riches of the full assurance of understanding least any should beguile them,
Col. 2. 24. That that is halting, is easily turned out of the way, and
therefore it is necessary to go steddily and strongly in the right way: Heb.
12. 13. They that are children in understanding and wavering, will be easily
carried away with every wind of vain doctrine, Ephesians. 4. 14. Whom did the
seducers in old time prevail with? 2. Tim. 3. 6, 7. With simple women that
were ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth: And
2. Pet. 2. 14. With unstable souls. And no marvel: For (though we are wont to
wonder at the absurdities of every contrary Religion; and think a simple man
may easily be able to answer, whatsoever they can say. And the confidence we
have in our selves this way, is a chief cause why we do not more carefully
seek to ground our selves in the knowledge of the truth; yet) it is certain,
that the grossest adversaries of the truth are able to use such reasons and
persuasions as have in them great probability and show of truth. The Apostle
says of the Seducers of his time, that they had. Coloss. 2. 4. (...), and
Ephesians. 4. 14. (...), and (...), a notable vein in persuading; a great deal of
cunning, even such as cheaters and coggers at dice do use, much craft to
beguile and circumuent them that they deal with.

4. No man can be saved, unless he be willing to suffer for his Religion,
yea, even to die for it, If any man will come after me says our Savior, Luke
9. 23. let him deny himself and take up his Cross daily and follow me. And
Luke 14. 26. If any man come to me and hate not his own life, that is, be
not willing to part with it for my sake, he cannot be my Disciple. And Revel.
3. 10. Be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee the crown of life.
And who can do that but he that is well grounded and certain of the truth of
his Religion. No man can have peace in his conscience, nor comfort in the evil
day, in the hour of death or time of great affliction, that is uncertain in
his Religion.

5. A good conscience that gives a man assurance that he is in the state of
grace, in the right way to life, will yield a man unspeakable comfort at all
times, when a man is sure that God accepts his work, then may he well say to
himself, Go eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a cheerful
heart, Eccl. 9. 7. Yea in the time of greatest affliction, such a one may have
much comfort. On the other side how can he have comfort in that day that is
unresolved? when he shall consider that he must either go to heaven or hell,
and that there is but one way to heaven, and that he is uncertain whether he
be in that one way or no; how can he choose but be in extreme perplexity. As
the man that trauells in a tempestuous weather, ready to be benighted, and
knows not the way, and is sure that if he miss the right way, he shall fall
into the hands of thieves, or other certain peril of his life, must needs be
in extreme fear and anguish of heart: so it is in this case. Say such an one
do use to pray, and do good works, all this can yield him no comfort. He
that doubts (says the Apostle, Romans 14. 23.) is condemned if he eat,
because he does it not of faith: and whatsoever is not of faith, is sin. Even
the doubts that the faithful feel in themselves (though they be not quite
void of faith and certainty) cause much discomfort to them as it appears by
the tears that that poor man shed (...) ^is unbelief, Mar. 9. 24. and by
that sadness and sorrow of heart, which ^e two Disciples of Emaus felt in
themselves when they doubted whether Christ were the true Messiah, Luke 24. 17.
How much more such as have no faith, no certainty at all mixed with them?
Therefore the Lord bids them that would find rest to their souls, use all
means to find out the good way and walk in it, Ier. 6 16. And the Apostle
gives this for one reason, why he did so much desire, that the Colossians might
attain to all riches of the assurance of understanding, that their hearts
might be comforted, Col. 2. 2.

2. The example of the Papists. Though this have been a maine principal in
their Religion, that ignorance is the mother of devotion; yet now even women
among them grow perfect and ready in the grounds of their Religion, and are
able to give a reason of that they hold, and to teach their children also. And
what shame is that for us?

1. For exhortation to diligence in the use of all means whereby we may Use 1.
grow to certainty in our Religion. 1. We must live under and frequent an
ordinary Ministry. For that is ordained for this end, that we may be no longer
as children tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine, Ephesians. 4. 14. And ye
hear of few seduced either by Papists or Brownists, that did enjoy an ordinary
and settled Ministry. 2. We must give our selves to reading of good books,
specially of the Scriptures; for they are able to make us wise to salvation, 2.
Timothy 3. 15. 3. We must use in our doubts to confer and move questions to
such as are able to resolve us, the Priests lips should keep knowledge, so
the people should seek the law at his mouth, Malachy 2. 7. And Cornelius was
directed to send for Peter and to seek resolution in all his doubts from him,
Acts 10. 5. 32. 4. Because the Lord only is the teacher that can resolve and
persuade our hearts, we must give our selves much to humble and faithful
prayer, so did David, Psalm 119. 18. open thou mine eyes, etc. so did the
Spouse of Christ, when she found her self in danger to be seduced, Cant. 1. 7.
and Cornelius being in doubt and perplexity this day, sought by fasting and
prayer to receive direction and resolution from God, Acts 10. 30.

2. For reproof, 1. Of them that willingly remain unsettled in Religion upon
this pretense, that by reason of the many differences in Religion, 2.
they find in the world, and the great show of reason each side has, and the
foul faults that they discern in men of all Religions, they see great cause
to doubt them all, and small hope to attain to any certainety, and therefore
they will serve God, and not trouble themselves to enquire whether side has
the truth. For the Elect, and such as have grace, and good hearts, shall be
able to attain to certainty, though there were never so great differences and
occasions of doubting. Of the Elect it is said, Matthew. 24. 24. That it is not
possible for them to be deceived, and John 10. 4, 5. That Christ's sheep know
his voice and will follow him; and a stranger they will not follow, because
they know not his voice: and of the godly and such as use the means of grace
and knowledge with a good heart, it is said, that the Light shall shine upon
their ways, Job 22. 28. That God will instruct and teach them in the way that
they should go and guide them with his eye, Psalm 32. 8. That the secret of
the Lord is revealed to them that fear him: and his covenant to give them
understanding, Psalm 25. 14. That their ears shall hear a word behind them,
saying, this is the way walk ye in it, Esaias 30. 21. That they shall know of
that doctrine which is taught them, whether it be of God, or whether their
teacher speak of himself, John 7. 17. That they have an unction from the holy
one, and know all things: John 2. 20. Such shall understand the Scripture and
grow unto certainty. For the testimony of the Lord is sure, and makes wise
the simple, Psalm. 19. 7. It is able to give subtlety to the simple, and to the
child knowledge and discretion, Pro. 1. 4. So that all such as resolve that
they will remain neuters, and seek for no certainty, give evidence against
themselves, that they belong not to Gods election, nor have any grace in them.

2. Them that are ignorant and utterly unacquainted with matters of Religion,
that think and speak of these things carelessly, or as of things that nothing
concern them. Such are the most, even of those that have best leisure, and
best wits and memories; to them that may be applied, which is in Hosea 8. 12. I
have written to them the great things of my Law: but they are counted as a
strange thing. But how well soever these persons judge of themselves, the Holy
Ghost pronounces them to be plain Atheists and contemners of God, as you
shall see, Job 21. 14, 15. they (do in deed and heart) say unto God depart from
us, that say we desire not the knowledge of thy ways, yea such do say in
their hearts, what is the Almighty that we should serve him, and what profit
should we have if we pray unto him.

3. Such as (though they approve of the truth) wish well to them that profess
it, (and profess it themselves) yet do they it upon no other grounds then
this, that the state, and place we live in, do profess it, or upon this, that
such and such good men teach and hold it. Whereas we should not receive our
Religion upon any man's credit, but labor to see the grounds of it with our
own eyes. The people of God are not drawn to a resolution in Religion by
company or compulsion, but upon their free choice. They examine it, Matthew. 13.
44. Acts 17. 11. And see good reason and ground for it; and thereupon advisedly
and voluntarily choose it, Psalm. 119. 30. I have chosen the way of truth: and
thy judgments have I laid before me. So as they are able to say, We believe
and know. John 6. 69. We should be able to give a reason of that we hold in
Religion, 1. Pet. 3. 15. And it is noted for the property of the unsound
hearted hearer, Mar. 4. 6. That h^e receives with gladness immediately what
he hears, without ever examining it before. The faith and Religion most men
have, is rather sucked in with their mothers milk, then received by the
instruction of their teachers. They hold it, because it is commonly believed;
not because it is certainly true. It is not chosen by them upon their own
judgment, but taken in, upon common credit.

Lecture the one and thirtieth, November 7. 1609.
THe last day we heard what the question was, that troubled the mind of this
Woman, and wherein she did desire to be resolved by our Savior; namely,
concerning the true Church and Religion of God, which I told you was the second
part of this Text: follows now the third and last part of it; namely, the
reason that moved her to doubt of this matter, and to be perplexed in her mind
about this question; and that was this. On the one side her Fathers had
worshipped God in Mount Gerizim, and that made her think that that was the
best place to serve God in: and on the other side, Christ whom she knew to be a
Prophet, and all others that were of his Religion, said, that in Jerusalem was
the place where men ought to worship, and that made her doubt she had served
God amiss all this while. Where we have to observe, that the Samaritans made
the example and custom and authority of their forefathers the rule and warrant
of their Religion, and that was that that deceived them.

And from thence we learn this Doctrine: That it is not safe but dangerous in
matters of Religion to ascribe too much to antiquity, and to Doct. 6.
the example and custom of our forefathers. But before I confirm this
Doctrine, least any should think we make no account of antiquity, or of the
example and authority of our forefathers, four things shall be premised for
the right understanding of this doctrine, concerning the account that is to be
made in matters of Religion, 1. Of antiquity. 2. Of our forefathers. 3. Of our
natural parents and ancestors. 4. Of the customs of the places wherein we
live.

1. There is an antiquity which is a certain and infallible note of the true
Religion. The old way is called the good way, Ier. 6. 16. The true Religion is
the most ancient Religion. So the Prophets that seduced Gods people to Idolatry
are said to have caused them to stumble in their way from the ancient ways,
Ier. 18. 15. So the Idolatry of the Jews is disgraced by this note that it was
new, Deuteronomy. 32. 17. They served new gods newly come up. And the true Church of
God is called, The ancient people, Esaias 44. 7. No people of any Religion in the
world may compare in antiquity with the true Church ofGod. But that is only
truly ancient in matters of Religion, which was from the beginning.

It is not the continuance of a thousand or two thousand years that can make
any thing in Religion truly ancient; but it must be from the beginning, or it
is not truly ancient. The Gospel is called an eternal Gospel, Apoc. 14. 6.
And so John commends his Doctrine, 1. John 1. 1. to be that which was from the
beginning. So our Savior gives this rule to try a truth in Religion by, Matthew.
19. 8. From the beginning it was not so. And the Apostle, 1. Cor. 11. 23.
grounds his Doctrine of the Sacrament, and the direction he gives to the Church
about it, upon the first institution of it. That is truly ancient in matters
of Religion that can fetch his original from him that is called the ancient of
days, Dan. 7. 9. That is from God himself and his Word. That that is derived
but from men is of no antiquity in this case. So the Lord in that place I cited
even now, Deuteronomy. 32. 17. calls the idolatry of the Israelites the worshipping of
new gods newly come up (though they had continued in the world many hundred
years. (For Abraham's ancestors were Idolaters, Josh. 24. 2.) because it was
but the device of man, and had not warrant from his Word. That which is
grounded upon the authority of the Prophets and Apostles, which wrote by divine
inspiration; that, and that only, has true antiquity for it: which made John
say, 1. Ioh. 2. 7. The old commandment is the Word. So that whatsoever
Doctrine is taught and confirmed by the authority of the Word; though it may
seem new to men, because they never heard of it before, yet it is not new in
it self; neither can they that teach or receive it, be justly called
Nouellists or newfangled men. It was no innovation or new-fanglednesse in
Nehemiah to celebrate the feast of the Tabernacles, Nehemiah 8. 17. Though it
had been out of use from the days of Joshua unto that time, because it had
the warrant and authority of the Word of God. And whatsoever Doctrine is
taught, or custom received in the Church, without the warrant and authority of
the Word, though it could be proved to have been taught and received one
thousand six hundred years ago, by such and such famous men, and ancient
Churches, yet it is a novelty, and has no true antiquity to commend it unto
us.

2. As we have this to say for antiquity, so say we also of our forefathers,
that there are certain Fathers whose example ought to be of great authority
with us in matters of Religion. Remember the days of old (says the Lord)
Deuteronomy. 32. 7. Consider the years of so many generations; ask thy father, and
he will show thee, thine elders and they will tell thee. And Job 8. 8. Inquire
of the former age, and prepare thy self to search of their Fathers. And it is
often noted, as Deuteronomy. 32. 17. Ier. 44. 3. and 194. to aggrauate the sin of the
Jews that they served new gods, newly come up, gods whom their fathers knew
not. So that if we should walk in a new way that our elders and forefathers
had not walked in, we had just cause to fear we are not in the right way. Our
Savior directing his Church how to find the right way, bids her observe the
steps of the old flock: Cant. 1. 8. and Ierem. 18. 15. He calls the false way,
a way that was not trodden. But these Fathers that should be of such authority
with us in matters of Religion, are they only that have followed the direction
of the word. Amon is blamed for forsaking the God of his fathers: 2. Kings 21.
22. Yet walked he in the way of his own father, and of most of his ancestors;
Yea, it is expressly said, that he did evil in the sight of the Lord, as his
father Manasses did: verse 20. How is it then said, that he forsook the God
of his fathers? The reason is rendered in the same place: verse 22. because he
walked not in the way of the Lord. Those are the fathers we are to have respect
unto in the matters of Religion, that walk in the way of the Lord, and none
but they. So that, as our Savior says: Matthew. 12. 50. Whosoever shall do my
fathers will which is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother; So
may we truly say, that all the godly that in former ages have walked in the
way of the Lord, they were our fathers. And though that we did know none of our
own ancestors that professed the Religion that we do; Yet so long as we
profess no other Religion then the Patriarchs, Prophets and Apostles did, and
many other holy men that have lived since the Apostles times, we cannot justly
be said to have forsaken the God of our fathers, or to be of any other Religion
then our forefathers were of.

3. In some cases there is great respect also to be had to the example even of
our natural parents. It should be a great bond for a Christian to keep him in
the love of the truth, when his own parents and ancestors have been lovers
and professors of the true Religion. This is noted to the praise of Azaria and
Iotham, 2. King. 15. 3. and 34. They did uprightly in the sight of the Lord,
according to all that their fathers did. That is the reason why Paul puts
Timothy in mind of the piety that was both in his mother and grandmother: 2.
Tim. 1. 5. And a double condemnation shall doubtless fall upon such, as have
had religious parents. if themselves become either Papists or profane men.
This is noted to the shame of the Israelites: Judge. 2. 17. That they turned
quickly out of the way wherein their fathers walked, obeying the commandments
of God, but they did not so. And Iehoram the King of Judah received a writing
from Eliah the Prophet, threatening extreme vengeance against him; because he
had not walked in the ways of Iehosaphat and Asa; having so good a father, and
so good a grandfather, that he yet became himself so ungracious a man: 2.
Chron. 21. 12. 14.

4. Some authority and religious respect, is also sometimes to be given even to
the customs, and fashions of the places where we live. Paul alleges the
custom of the Churches to stop the mouth of contentious men, 1. Cor. 11. 16.
Good customs taken up upon good grounds, received and long continued among
Gods people, should not lightly be broken and laid down. For the Israelites,
2. Kings 17. 34. are blamed for breaking their customs. The Apostle commends
sundry truths to the people of God by this argument, that they had received
them and makes that a further bond unto their conscience: 1. Cor. 15. 1. I
declare to you the Gospel which I preached to you, which ye also received and
wherein ye continue. And Phil. 4. 9. Those things which ye have both learned
and received, those things do, and the God of peace shall be with you. Yea it
is no small sin for any private man, to break the good orders and customs
of the Church of God, or to seek to be privileged and exempted from them.
There is a general rule given us: Pro. 2. 20. Walk in the ways of good men,
and keep the ways of the righteous: and God has made a promise to them that
will learn the ways of his people, and conform themselves unto them. Ier.
12. 16. Say there were no law to bind us to give every Sabbath somewhat at
Church to the relief of the poor: yet the very custom of a Congregation
(being) according to the word (for the Apostle says he set this order in all
the Churches of Galatia, 1. Cor. 16. 1.) should bind us to continue in it, and
cannot be despised by any without sin. Say there we^ no law to bind such as
have committed fornication, with the public scandal of the Congregation, to
profess their repentance publicly, for the satisfaction of the congregation,;
Yet the very custom of the congregation grounded upon Gods Word, as this is
(for the Apostle required that the fornicator should be put from among them,
that is, separated from the privileges of the Church, till he had professed
his repentance. 1. Cor. 5. 2. And our Savior inioynes him that had given
offense, but to one member of the Church, not to presume to offer his gift to
God, till he had made satisfaction to his neighbor: Mat. 5. 24. And how much
more respect is to be had to a whole congregation, then to any one member) I
say this very custom of the congregation thus grounded upon the Word, should
not be violated in favor of any man.

These four points being thus premised, it remains that I confirm the
Doctrine. viz. That it is dangerous in matters of Religion to ascribe too much
to antiquity or to the custom or example of our forefathers. For proof of
this Doctrine look into the holy Scriptures, and into the examples of all
ages, and you shall find that the chief hardner of men in superstition has
been the ancient custom and use of their forefathers: so the Prophet speaks
of the Jews in his time, Ier. 9. 14. They walked after the stubbornenesse of
their own hearts and after Baalims which their fathers taught them. And the
Apostle Peter says of them he wrote to: 1. Pet. 1. 18. That all their vain
conversation was received by tradition of their fathers: and in this place, the
thing that hardened the Samaritans in their superstition, was this, their
fathers worshipped in this mountain.

The Reasons why it is not safe, but dangerous in matters of Religion to rely
too much upon antiquity and upon the custom of our forefathers, are these.

1. Because it is evident that many of the grossest errors that ever were in
Religion are of great antiquity. The Idolatry of the Pagans was of Reason.
great antiquity: Ioshu. 14. 2. The superstition of the Jews that hold the
observation of Moses ceremonies necessary to salvation, is of great antiquity.
For it began in the Apostles days: Acts 15. 1. The corruptions of Religion
that the Pharisees held in Christ's time, were very ancient: Matthew. 5. 21, 27,
33. Ye have heard it has been said to them of old time, etc. And so the
errors of the Papists may not be denied to be very ancient. For the mystery of
iniquity began to work even in the Apostles time: 2 Thessalonians. 2. 7.

2. It is no undutifulness in a child, to swerue from his fathers example in
any thing, wherein his father has swerued from the Word of God. Our parents
must be obeyed in the Lord, Ephesians. 6. 1. and are called the parents of our
bodies; and the Lord the Father of our spirits and consciences. Heb. 12. 9. And
in this case we have a rule: Matthew. 23. 9. Call no man father upon earth, for
one is your father which is in heaven.

The Use of this Doctrine is manifold. First: For the justifying of our
Religion against one of the chief objections the Papists make against it, Use
1.
(namely, that it is new, and no elder then Luther) and for the confirming our
hearts against it. If this should be true, it were indeed sufficient to prove
it a false Religion. But first it should not seem strange to us to have the
true Religion of God charged with novelty. This is an old slander, What new
doctrine is this, say the Jews of Christ's own doctrine, Mark 1. 27. May we
know what this new doctrine is whereof thou speak, say the Athenians to
Paul, Acts 17. 29. 2. It is evident by authentical stories, that this truth
that we profess has had many witnesses in every age since the Apostles times,
even in the darkest times of Popery. And though Master Luther were Gods blessed
instrument to bring it to light in this last age, as Hilkia was of finding the
book of Gods Law, 2. King. 22. 8. Yet was not he the author of it, no more
then Hilkia was of that. 3. Say we could not show any that had professed it for
1500. years before Luther, yet because we hold nothing but that which has
witness of the law, of the Prophets, as Romans 3. 21. Our Religion must needs be
held to be truly ancient.

2. For defending of our selves against the imputation of undutifulness
toward our ancestors which the Papists also cast upon us, as if by professing
this Religion we did condemn all our forefathers. For first many that lived in
the midst of the darkness of Popery, were extraordinarily preserved from the
gross errors of the Papists (as the three children were in the fiery furnace,
Dan. 3. 27.) and enlightened with the knowledge of the truth, which we our
selves do now profess, as may evidently be proved by story. Neither should
this seem strange, since we know the Lord has been wont at such times, and
in such places as he has denied the ordinary means of grace unto, to
preserve, instruct, and save his Elect extraordinarily: so he had 7000. in the
ten Tribes that had not once bowed their knee to Baal, 1. King. 19. 18. So he
wrought faith in Rahab while she lived among the cursed Cananites, Heb. 11. 31.
And in the wise men while they lived in the East in the midst of Pagans and
Idolaters, Mat. 2. 1. 2. 2. Many that professed Popery in their life time,
might yet find mercy with him (specially in the most fundamental point of
faith the doctrine of justification) at the hour of death; which we have no
cause to doubt of, not only because the Scripture has revealed that the Lord
uses to call some at the last hour, Matthew. 20. 6, 7. But because we find by
experience, that even now adays, though men be now far more obstinate, and
more settled in Popery, then our forefathers could be (as having stronger means
to corrupt and poison them then they had) and though their sin be far
greater then the sin of our forefathers was, because they sin against the
light that is so clearly revealed, yea many of them in Apostasy, from the
truth they had formerly professed. Yet even now adays many Papists find that
mercy with God as to renounce Popery at the hour of their death in that maine
doctrine of justification by works. 3. We have the rather cause to hope and
judge that our forefathers, many of them did find that mercy with the Lord;
because we know by those monuments of piety that they left behind them, that
they had the zeal of God in them, which is a good ground of hope, as we may
see, Paul's hearty desire and prayer to God for Israel was that they might be
saved, because they had the zeal of God, Romans 10. 1, 2. 4. Say the Papists
could certainly prove that our ancestors did both live and die Papists, yet
is it no undutifulness in us, to swerue from their example in that wherein we
are sure they swerued from the Word of God: and we are often charged in the
Scripture not to make the example of our forefathers the rule of our conscience
in this case, as we have heard.

3. For the discovering of the weak foundations that most Papists have to
build their conscience on in the matter of their Religion, which is no more but
this, that their parents and ancestors were of that faith, and not Papists
only, but even the greatest part of ignorant people, have no other ground for
many things they hold in Religion but only this the custom of their
neighbors, and of their forefathers.

4. For the conuincing of Popery to be a false Religion, even by this their
own argument, that it is a new Doctrine, and has no true antiquity to commend
it unto us. 1. We are well able to show that many of their errors were not
received into the Church 600. years after Christ. We are able to name the
first authors of many of their corruptions. 2. Though we could not prove they
sprung up since the Apostles times, nor name the time when they first were
broached, it would not follow from thence, that their Religion is the faith
that was first delivered by the Apostles. For 1. Many heresies began in the
Apostles days, 1. John 2. 18. and 4. 1. yea of Popery it is said that it began
to work then, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 7. 2. It is often noted in the word of sundry spirits
of error, that they use to creep in so privily, that they cannot easily be
spied or discerned. Matthew. 13. 25. Gal. 2. 4. 2. Tim. 3. 6. 2. Pet. 2. 1. Jude
4. And above all heresies Popery is called a mystery, These. 2. 7. No marvel
therefore though men could not discern when first it began to work. 3. There
be many gross errors that have been held in the Church (as the Papists
themselves will confess) the first author whereof can not be named. 4. The
Reason is evident, why the errors of Popery were not easily discerned at the
first, nor opposed: because they (many of them especially) carried so great
show of holiness and were (happily) first broached by such as were esteemed holy
and good men, 1. Timothy 4. 3. They teach lies through hypocrisy. 3. Though we
had no other reason to prove their Religion to be new, this is sufficient,
that it is not grounded upon the holy Scriptures.

THE TWO AND THIRTIETH LECTVRE, ON NOVEMBER XXI. MDCIX.
IOH. IIII. XXI, XXII, XXIII. Jesus said unto her, woman, believe me, the
hour comes when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor at Jerusalem worship
the Father.

Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know: for
salvation is of the Jews.

But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the
Father in spirit and truth: for the Father requires even such to worship him.


THese words contain the answer, that our Savior gives unto that question
and doubt, which the woman of Samaria had propounded to him in the former
verse. Her question was (as we have heard) concerning the place of Gods
worship; yet not concerning the place of Gods moral worship; (for she knew
well enough, that the Jews used to pray, and to read, and preach; not in
Jerusalem only, but in all their Synag gues.) But her question was, concerning
the place of Gods solemn worship, which stood in sacrifices and other
ceremonies, appointed in Moses Law; which the Jews held might be performed
only in Jerusalem; the Samaritans only in the Temple they had upon mount
Gerizim. This she (being ignorant and superstitious) esteemed to be the only
worship of God. And concerning the place where this worship was to be
performed, she desires to be resolved by our Savior Christ. Our Saviors
answer to her question consists of two parts. First, concerning the place of
Gods worship, which she desired to be resolved in, and that is set down verse
21. The second concerns the worship itself, which she did so highly esteem
of, and that is set down in the three verses following. The sum of the first
part of his answer, which is contained in this 21. verse, (and concerns the
place of Gods worship) is this: that though the time had been, that the Jews
(by good warrant of Gods Word) had held Jerusalem and the Temple there, and the
Samaritans (out of their superstition) had held mount Gerezim and the Temple
there, holier then any other place in the world besides, and that the worship
done there (even for the place sake) was more acceptable to God, then if it had
been done in any other place; yet the time was now at hand, that all
difference of places for Gods worship should be taken away, and this
partition wall that was between the Jews, and the Samaritans, and all other
nations, should be broken: and that therefore there was no cause, she should
trouble her self about the place of Gods worship, to know whether of the two
places were the holier, or the better to serve God in. And this he is not
content barely to affirm, but confirms it to her by a vehement asseueration;
Woman, believe me, this is so. For the interpretation of the words, and
clearing them from all obscurity, we must observe. 1. That by the hour, he
speaks of here, he means the just time, and moment, that God in his eternal
counsel had set for the abrogation of the ceremonial Law; and that was the
time of his death, and Passion, when so soon as he had said, John 19. 30. It
is finished; He gave up the Ghost, and presently the veil of the Temple was
rent from the top to the bottom, Matthew. 27. 51. From that hour there was no
more holiness in the Temple then in any other place.

2. By saying the hour comes, and not shall come, his meaning is to note, It
should come presently. So Micah 7. 4. The day of thy watchmen and thy
visitation comes. So Psalm. 37. 13. he sees that his day is coming.

3. That when he says, they shall worship God, neither in this mount, nor at
Jerusalem, his meaning is not, that it should be unlawful after his death, to
worship God, in either of those places. For the Apostles and the rest of the
faithful did after his death, and ascension continue daily with one accord in
the Temple, Acts 2. 46. But his meaning is, they should not do it only there,
nor be addicted to those places, more then to any other.

4. That when he says, ye shall neither in this mount, nor at Jerusalem, etc.
speaking to one person in the Plural Number, he means all such, as desired
to serve God aright (as this poor woman now did) intimating also therein, that
this woman should become a true Christian, a true worshipper of God.

5. That by the Father, is not meant the first Person in the Trinity (as if our
worship and prayers were only to be directed unto him) but the whole God head:
As 1 Cor. 8. 6. There is but one God, which is the Father, Ephesians. 4. 6. One God
and Father of all, which is above all, and through all, and in you all. And the
reasons, why God is called the Father, are these. 1. Because he is the
fountain of our being, and of our whole welfare. As Mal. 2. 10. Have we not
one Father? Has not one God made us? 2. Because this of all names, is fittest
to allure us to worship him, and call upon him; so soon as Gods Spirit makes
us able to pray, it teaches us to cry Abba Father Gal. 4. 6. And our Savior
of all the names, and attributes of God, teaches us to call him by that name,
when we would pray unto him, Matthew. 6. 9. 3. In this place specially he calls
him the Father, rather then God, to meet with the superstitious conceit this
woman had of her Fathers; and to teach her, that in the matter of her
conscience, and Religion, one Father only is to be acknowledged, even the
Lord; according to that: Matthew. 23. 9. Call no man your Father upon earth, for
one is your Father which is in heaven.

These words then thus interpreted, divide themselves into two parts.

1. The asseueration whereby he confirms and seeks to persuade this Woman in
the Doctrine that he teaches, in these words. Woman believe me.

2. The Doctrine it self which he teaches, and confirms to her by this
asseueration; The hour comes, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor
at Jerusalem worship the father. Now that we may receive instruction from the
first part; it is to be observed here, that our Savior being to teach unto
this woman a great point of Doctrine, touching the abrogation of the law of
Moses, and of the Temple, such a point as he had not taught before unto any, as
being a Doctrine indeed which the Jews were not fit to hear; he uses no
proof and authority to confirm it unto her, but his own bare testimony,
Woman believe me, as if he should have said; rest not thy conscience upon the
example of thy forefathers, nor of thy neighbors: give not credit unto them in
this case; believe me, give credit to me.

Whence we learn this Doctrine: This honor is due to Christ, and to him alone
to be believed in matter of Doctrine upon his own Word. Doct. 1.
None of all the Prophets durst challenge this to themselves, but as they that
came not in their own name, but were only messengers from another; and
interpreters of the will of another; they delivered their Doctrine always
under this warrant, Thus says the Lord, Ier. 2. 2. Ezech. 2. 4. Nor any of the
Apostles: whatsoever Paul taught, he was wont to confirm it by authority of
the written word, Act. 28. 23. He preached to them out of the law of Moses,
and out of the Prophets. They did not desire that any thing should be received
into the Church upon their credit, but they did carefully shun this, as an high
presumption. This was the speech of the Prophets, Esaias 21. 10. That which I
have heard of the Lord of hoasts, the God of Israel, have I showed unto you.
And this was the speech of the Apostle, 1. Cor. 11. 23. I have received of the
Lord, that which I have delivered unto you. And on the other side, we shall
find our Savior taught after another fashion, not as an interpreter of the
law, but as the lawgiver himself, Luke 4. 32. They were astonished at his
doctrine, for his Word was with power, and Matthew. 7. 29, He taught as one
having authority, and not as the Scribes; nor as any other teachers were wont
to do. Indeed, he often confirms his Doctrine by Scripture, John 6. 45. Luke
19. 46. and 24. 46. This he did 1. Either in respect of their weakness, whom
he did instruct; because they did not so fully know him to be the Son of God,
but the testimony of the Scripture was of more authority with them, I receive
not the testimony of man (says he, John 5. 34.) but these things I say that
ye may be saved. Therefore he alleging the Scripture, calls it their law,
John 8. 17. and 10. 34. and 15. 25. Or 2. To confirm unto them the authority
of the Scriptures, and to give us an example. But that was more then he was
bound to do, or then he was wont usually to do. Therefore this was the usual
confirmation he gave of his Doctrine, John 3. 3. 5. Verily, verily I say unto
you. And against all the false interpretations of the law of God, that had
been delivered by the ancient fathers, he opposes no more but his own
authority, ye have heard that it was said thus and thus to them of old time.
But I say unto you, thus and thus, Matthew. 5. 22.

The Reasons of the Doctrine are two. 1. The Reason why our Savior was to be
believed on his bare word, is, because even as he Reas. 1.
was man, there was no sin nor error in him, 1. Pet. 2. 22. He did no sin,
neither was there guile found in his mouth. But he was more then man, he was
God himself. He was the Author of the whole Word of God, which is therefore
called the Word of Christ, Col. 3. 16. and therefore he needed not to confirm
any thing by Scripture. Every word he spoke, was the Word of God, and therefore
credit was of right due unto it, without any further proof. It was he that
said, Pro. 8. 8. All the words of my mouth are righteous.

2. The Reason why no man's word is to be taken in matters of Doctrine, Reas. 2.
or Religion, is this; because all men are subject unto error, 1. Cor. 13. 9.
There is imperfection in our knowledge, and imperfection in our prophesying and
teaching of others, Romans 3. 4. Let God be true, and every man a liar. This is
proper to God, that he cannot be deceived himself, nor deceive others. And
Gods people have been in great danger, in giving too much credit and authority
even unto very good men, as we may see in these three examples, first, that of
the old Prophet, 1. King. 13. 18. that of Peter, Gal. 2. 13. and that of the
brethren, who diswaded Paul from going to Jerusalem, Acts 21. 12.

This Doctrine serves both for exhortation, and for reproof.

The first Use is to exhort every one of us, to give this glory unto Christ, as
to believe him upon his Word, to give credit unto the Word of God, Use 1.
even without the testimony or authority of any man: yea though we see no
reason for it; yea though it seem never so contrary unto our own reason. We
must in this case be like Pythagoras his scholars, and so rest in that (...).
When once we hear, Thus says the Lord, this must suffice us, in stead of all
reason: here we must rest and satisfy our selves. This is called the
obedience of faith, Romans 16. 26. Yea this is the first and chief obedience
that God requires of us; discente^ oportet credere. The first work of his
grace in us, is to subdue our reason, 2. Cor. 10. 5. Casting down the
imaginations, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of
Christ. Till we have attained to this simplicity, we shall never become wise
unto salvation, nor come to any comfortable certainty in the matters of
Religion. This is that simplicity which is spoken of, Psalm. 19. 7. The
testimony of the Lord is sure, and gives wisdom to the simple, and Pro. 1.
4. To give unto the simple sharpness of wit.

The second Use of this Doctrine, is, to dissuade us from giving that honor
unto any man, as to receive any thing in Religion upon his word 2.
or credit. For this honor as you have heard, belongs unto Christa lone. The
Apostle requires indeed, that Gods people should obey them that have the
oversight of them, and subject themselves, Heb. 13. 17. But this obedience is
not Coeca obedientia, such as the Jesuits bind themselves and their scholars
unto, absolute obedience, to receive and believe every thing that they teach:
but there is liberty and commandment also given to all Gods people, to try the
Doctrine of their teachers, whether it be agreeable to the Word of God or no;
and accordingly to receive or reject it. You know that the Beraeans are
commended for doing this: though they had no meaner teachers then Paul and
Silas, Acts 17. 11. And it was to the people, that that commandment was given,
1 Thessalonians. 5. 20, ^1. Despise not prophecyings, prove all things, and 1. Ioh. 4.
1. believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they be of God.

The third Use of this Doctrine is for reproof. For many there be that give
too little credit unto Christ, and too much unto man. 3.


1. The Papists give every whit as much credit unto the Church, as they do
unto the Word of God, nay more a great deal. They will not believe the
Scripture, unless the Church give testimony unto it: but the Church they will
believe even in those things, wherein the Scripture gives no testimony to it at
all. Let the Scripture teach any thing never so plainly, never so clearly,
they will still make doubt of the meaning of it: and how know you this to be
the meaning say they? as if the Scriptures (of which the Holy Ghost says, Romans
15. 4. What soever is written, is written for our learning, and 2. Tim. 3. 16.
The whole Scripture is profitable to instruction, were uttered, and written
like Apolloes oracles, so darkely, as none could have any certainty of the
meaning of them; on the other side let the Church hold any thing, be it never
so absurd, so contrary to Religion, and to reason also; yet may there not any
question be made of it. So that to them doubtless that curse belongs, Ier.
17. 5. Cursed be the man that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, and
withdraws his heart from the Lord.

2. The disputer of the world, of whom the Apostle speaks, 1. Cor. 1. 20.
Where is the disputer of this world? ((...)) such as will receive no more in
Religion then they can see reason for: Scripture will not serve their turn,
they must have reason. Such as give liberty to themselves, not only to nourish
in their own hearts many reasonings and oppositions against such truths, as
are manifestly taught in the holy Scripture; but dare also openly reason, and
maintain argument against the Word of God. 1. I blame not any for asking,
doubting, or making question of the meaning of such places of Scripture, as are
obscure, (as some places indeed are, 2. Pet. 3. 16.) For the Disciples did so
(Mar. 4. 20.) and are not reproved for it. But this I blame, that they dare
reason against such places of Scripture, as are plain and manifest. 2. I do
not deny, but a Christian may desire to know the reason of that he holds and
believes in Religion, and of whatsoever is taught him, so he do it, 1. With
reverence, 2. Out of a desire to be further confirmed in the truth, 3. With a
resolution to yield to that reason which God has revealed in his Word, and to
seek no further. For every one should be able to answer them that demand a
reason of him of the hope that is in him, 1. Pet. 3. 15. And Christians should
seek to be not children, but of a ripe age in knowledge. 1. Cor. 14. 20. and
the blessed Virgin is not blamed for asking with this mind; How can this be?
Luke 1. 34. But it is a dangerous sin, not to rest in the authority of the
Scripture, not to count it, (...). Let every man take heed how he gives
himself liberty to cavil and dispute against such truths, as are clearly
revealed in the Scripture; that is that which the Apostle does so reprove,
Romans 9. 19. 20. speaking of the high mystery of Gods Predestination, Thou will
say then unto me, why does he yet find fault? for who has resisted his
will? Nay, but o man who art thou that replyest against God? Those things which
we cannot understand, we must admire, and say, as the Apostle does, Romans 11.
33. O the depth, etc. Laying the fault not upon the Scriptures; but on our own
blockishnesse, and inability to conceive the reason of it. For there be many
truths of God revealed in the Word, which are such mysteries, as it is not
possible for man by reason, and by light of nature to conceive: nay indeed the
whole doctrine of the Gospel is so, we speak the wisdom in a mystery says
the Apostle, 1. Cor. 2. 7. and 1. Tim. 3. 16. Great is the mystery of godliness,
yea the more a man excels in natural reason and understanding, the more
unable shall he be to conceive them, Romans 8. 17. The wisdom of the flesh is
enmity to God. It is God only, that by the supernatural light of his Spirit
reuealeth these things. Matthew. 16. 17. And God will reveal it to none, but to
those that are meek and humble, to none that have such high conceit of
themselves, and attribute so much to their own reason, Psalm. 25. 9. the meek
will he teach his way.

3. The curious hearer that disdaines that Ministry, as unlearned, and of no
worth, that brings no other authority, nor other testimonies, but the testimony
of the Word of God; and yet it is evident, this was the course that the
Prophets and Apostles, yea and Christ himself took in their Ministry. 2. The
Scripture is sufficient to every purpose that concerns the Ministry, even to
make men wise unto salvation; to teach, to convince, to reprove, to exhort,
and even to make the man of God (the Minister of God) perfect, thoroughly
furnished unto every good work that he has to do in the whole exercise of his
ministry, 2. Tim. 3. 15, 16, 17. 3. There is no such certainetie in any other
testimony as the conscience can rely upon, because every man is subject to
error, Romans 3. 4.

4. The careless hearer, that never examines what he hears, but receives
every thing upon the credit of such as teach him. It is the commandment of
Christ, Mark 4. 24. Take heed what you hear. And it is too much readiness in
receiving that that is taught us, if we receive it before we have examined it,
Acts 17, 11. It is said to be a properti^ ^f a fool, to believe every thing,
Pro. 14. 15. Yea it is noted for the misery of a natural man, that (like a
beast) he is carried away as he is lead. 2. Cor. 12. 2. Three benefits
Christians should find in this, if they would examine by the word whatsoever
they hear, and labor to see the ground of it in the Scripture, before they
receive it.

1. They should grow to certainty in that they hold, when their faith shall
stand not in the wisdom of men, but of the power of God, as the Apostle
speaks, 1. Cor. 2. 5. so cannot the other.

2. They would persevere, and hold fast that they have learned, Matthew. 13. 44.
When he had withdrawn himself, and examined the treasure, he sold all for it.
Contrarily, he that incontinently and ouer-hastily received the Word, was soon
gone, Matthew. 13. 21.

3. They would obey, and make conscience of the practice of that they know, so
cannot the other, when the Apostle speaks of the obedience of the
Thessalonians, and of the power his Ministry had in their hearts and lives, he
gives this for the reason of it, 1 Thessalonians. 2. 13. that they received the Word
of God which they heard of him, not as the word of man, but as it was indeed
the Word of God, which also did work effectually in them that believed. For
then would the Doctrine be mighty in operation, when it is once found to be
well grounded upon the Word, of which it is said, Heb. 4. 12. that it is lively
and mighty in operation.

Lecture the three and thirtieth, November 28. 1609.
THe last day we heard, that this verse contains the first part of Christ's
answer to the question that this Woman propounded to him, and that it
consists of two parts. 1. An asseueration whereby he confirms the Doctrine
that he was to teach her in these words, Woman believe me. 2. The Doctrine it
self in these words; The hour comes, etc. The asseueration we finished the
last day, it remains now we come to the Doctrine it self.

The words I interpreted the last day to you, and told you the meaning of them,
was this, that the time was then at hand (namely the time of his Passion) when
all that did desire to worship God aright (as this Woman did) should not stand
more addicted unto, or put more holiness in Mount Gerizim (or Jerusalem
either) then in any other place. So that the Doctrine we are to learn from
these words, is this,

That this is one benefit we have by the death of our Savior, that now all
religious difference of places is taken away; no one place is holier then Doct.
2.
another. Before I confirm this Doctrine, I will clear it from an objection
that may be made against it. If all difference of places be taken away, then it
seems a man may serve God in his shop, or chamber as well as in the Church. I
answer. 1. Our Savior compares not private places with public; but public
with public, private with private. 2. It is true indeed, there is more respect
to be had, and more good to be received by the service, that is done to God in
the Church, then by that that is done in any private house. For the Apostle
speaks of this, as of a fearful sin, and step unto the unpardonable sin,
to forsake the assemblies, (...), Heb. 10. 25. 26. But that that makes the
service, we do to God there better then that we can do to him in houses, is
not the place or any holiness in it, but the assembly with which we join. 1.
In the public assembly we have the help of the Ministry of the Word and
Sacraments, the use whereof is to inflame and kindle devotion in our hearts,
did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us, and while he
opened to us the Scriptures, say the Disciples, Luke 24. 32. and to convey Gods
Spirit and grace into us, and is therefore called the ministration of the
spirit, 2. Cor. 3. 8. 2. We have the example of the zeal and devotion, and
cheerfulness of other of Gods servants, with whom we join; which is of great
force to correct our own sluggishnesse and drowsinesse, and to quicken Gods
graces in us, Your zeal provoked many, (says Paul) 2. Cor. 9. 2. And David
professes that he received much good, by beholding the forwardness of the
rest of Gods people, in frequenting the house of God, Psae. 122. 1, 2. And I
doubt not, but very many wicked men have found in their own experience, that as
it is said of Saul, when he came among the Prophets, though he came even with
evil mind; yet another heart was given him, and the Spirit of God came upon
him also, and he became like one of them, 1. Sa^. 19. 23, 24. So these men in
the assembly of Gods people, by beholding the reverent attention and devotion
of others, have found many good motions wrought in themselves. 3. There is much
more force in the prayers, wherein many of Gods servants join together, then
there can be in those, that any of them shall make severally and apart. The
joint forces of many, must needs prevail more with God, then if they were
single. Prayer therefore is compared to seeking and knocking, Matthew. 7. 7. And
when many seek a thing, there is more hope of finding: when many knock at
heaven gates, they will be the better heard, Matthew. 18. 19. Verily I say unto
you that if two of you (much more if many) shall agree on earth upon any thing,
whatsoever they shall desire, it shall be given them of my Father which is in
heaven. See the force of public prayer, wherein many of Gods servants do join
together. Therefore Gods people at such times as they have most desired to
prevail with God in prayer, have been careful to gather together, as public
assemblies, as they could possibly, ^oel (...). 15, 6. vt supra page 125. 4.
Christ has promised to be present in a more special and comfortable manner in
the assemblies of his people, then in any of our houses, or in any other place,
Matthew. 18. 20. and 28. 20. So that (for the assemblies sake) the service we do
to God in the Church, is to be preferred before that we can do in any other
place; not for any holiness that is in the place it self. And so much for the
clearing of the Doctrine from the objection that might be made against it. Now
I come to the confirmation of it. And to this purpose we must observe a notable
difference in this case, between the time before the death of our Savior
Christ, and that that followed.

Before our Saviors death we shall read of diverse places, that were holier
then others.

1. The whole land of Canaan, (because it was a type of the Church of Christ,
and of the kingdom of heaven) was esteemed by Gods people a better and more
holy place then any other in the world. That (among other reasons) made Jacob
and Joseph to be so desirous to be buried there. Five things are worthy to be
observed in Jacobs desire of this, He desired to be buried in Canaan. Though 1.
It was a great way off: 2. It could not be without great offense. Of Jacob we
read he calls Joseph, and charge him, Genesis 47. 29. 31. And not contenting
himself with that, he charge all his sons with it. Genesis 49. 29. 2. When?
immediately before his death; as a matter that he had the greatest care of,
Genesis 47. 29. 3. In what manner? exceeding affectionately and earnestly, Genesis
47. 29. If I have found grace in thy sight, deal mercifully and truly with
me, bury me not I pray thee in Egypt. 4. He bound his good son Joseph by
oath to it, and would not take his word, Genesis 47. 29. 31. 5. When he had gotten
Joseph to swear, his heart was so comforted, that he gave solemn thanks to
God for it, Genesis 47. 31.

2. In the land of Canaan, some places are said to have been more holy then
others: namely such, as wherein God did manifest himself in a special, and
sensible manner. So the place where the Son of God appeared to Moses in the
fiery bush, is called holy ground, Exodus 3. 5. And that wherein he appeared to
Joshua, Josh. 5. 15. And the Mount wherein he was transfigured is called by
Peter, The Holy Mount, 1. Pet. 1. 18. But these places were no longer accounted
holy, then during the time of this special presence of the Lord in them.
Neither can we read that any of Gods people did either go on pilgrimage to
those places after, or gave any religious respect unto them.

3. Jerusalem, because it was the place that the Lord had chosen to put his
name there, was ever (from the days of David to Christ's time) holier then any
other place of the world beside. It is called the holy City, Matthew. 4. 5. yea
even to the very moment of Christ's death it so continued, notwithstanding the
marvelous sins and corruptions of it, it is called the holy City still, Matthew.
27. 53.

4. The Temple (because God had hallowed it to put his name there for ever, 2.
Chron. 7. 16.) was yet a more holy place then any other place in Jerusalem, and
is therefore often called, The holy Temple, Psalm. 5. 8. Five things there be that
show their Temple to have been a most holy place, 1. Gods people were bound
wheresoever they dwelt, to resort thither at certain times, three times every
year all the males were bound to appear there, Exodus 23. 17. and the Eunuch
you know came even from Ethiopia to worship there, Acts 8. 27. 2. Many parts of
Gods worship they might perform no where, but only there, thither shall ye
bring all that I command you, your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your
tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all the choice vows, which ye
vow unto the Lord, Deuteronomy. 12. 11. 3. Those parts of Gods service which they
might perform in other places, (as prayer, even private prayer) was much
better and more pleasing to God, and more available to their comfort there
then in any other place. In which respect it is called; Matthew. 21. 12. The
house of prayer. And 2. Chron. 7. 15. Mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears
attentive to the prayer made in this place. Therefore David desired to behold
Gods power and glory, as he had beheld it in the Sanctuary, Psalm. 63. 1, 2.
Therefore it is said of Anna, that (though through the affliction of her mind,
she could not partake with her husband in the sacrifice and offerings) yet
she went up with him duly to the House of the Lord, even to make her secret
prayers there, 1. Samuel 1. 12. She continued praying before the Lord. David
went thither to make his private prayers, 2. Sam. 7. 18. So did the good
Publican, Luke 18. 10. Yea 4. when they could not go thither to pray, yet the
very looking toward the Temple, made their prayer more acceptable with God,
according to that prayer Solomon made in the dedication of the Temple that it
might be so, 1. King. 8. 44. 48. 5. Yea so holy was that Temple, and such
religious reverence did Gods people bear unto it; that after the Caldeans had
burnt it, they honored the very place where it had stood, and esteemed it
holier then any other. This appears by those 80. persons whom Ishmael
murdered, Ier. 41. 5. And by Daniels opening his windows toward Jerusalem
when he prayed, Dan. 6. 10.

5. In the Temple it self, though all the parts of it were holy, yet some
places in it were more holy then other some. For there was a place, where the
people stood separated from the Priests, Luke 1. 10. And this was an holy
place, so holy, that Mar. 11. 16. Christ would not suffer any to carry any
vessel through it. And there was a place where the Priests executed their
Ministry, which was holier then that, that the people stood in, and is
therefore called the holy place, Leuit. 16. 30. And 3. there was a place which
the high Priest might only enter into, and that but once a year, and that is
called the Holy of holies, the holiest place of all, Heb. 9. 3. Now since the
death of Christ, there is no place of the world, holier then other. No nation
is holy as the Land of Canaan was, no town as Jerusalem, no place where God is
worshipped, as the Temple was. Prayer is as available with God in one place as
in another. 1. Private prayer is so. For 1. Cor. 1. 2. Paul describes the
faithful to be such as call upon God in every place. 2. Public prayer is so,
1. Tim. 2. 8. I will that men pray every where. 3. Generally the whole worship
of God is so, Matthew. 18. 2. Wheresoever two or three are gathered together in
my name, etc. And this the Lord foretold to his Prophets, as a singular
privilege, that should come to the Church in the days of the Gospel, Zeph.
2. 11. Every man in all the parts of the heathen, shall worship God from his
own place, Mal. 1. 11. In every place from the rising of the Sun, to the going
down thereof, incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering
(incense and offering are named as the service that was peculiar unto the
Temple) Esaias 19. 19. In that day shall the Altar of the Lord be in the midst of
Egypt, and a pillar by the border thereof. And if this privilege was
vouchsafed to Egypt, which of all nations had most of all provoked God, how
much more to other nations?

To make this truth the more evident to the world. As the veil of the Temple
did rend immediately upon Christ's death, so within forty years after, (when by
the Apostles Ministry this Doctrine was sufficiently manifested to the world)
the Temple and City was utterly subverted and overthrown, according to the
Prophecy of Christ: Luke 19. 44. They shall make thee even with the ground,
and not leave in thee a stone upon a stone. And as Daniel Chap. 9. 26. Long
before prophesied that the Romans should destroy both the City and the
Sanctuary. The Reasons of this great alteration and change; why this great
difference, that was in places before, Reason.
is now quite taken away; why Jerusalem and the Temple lost all that holiness,
that was in them before, are principally four. 1. Because by Christ's coming
(and specially by his death) all that was fulfilled, that 1.
was signified by the Temple. For the Temple was but a type and shadow of
Christ's humanity, as our Savior himself witnesses: John 2. 21. And the
proportion stands in two points. 1. As the Lord dwelt in the Temple, and his
glory sensibly appeared in it, 1. Kings 8. 11. So all the fullness of the
Godhead did dwell bodily, and personally in Christ, Col. (...). 9. 2. As no
sacrifice was acceptable to God, unless it were offered in the Temple, So none
of our prayers, and spiritual sacrifices, are acceptable unto God, unless
they be offered up to God in Christ, 1. Pet. 2. 5. So that it is necessary,
that when the body was come, the shadow should cease. 2. Since Christ's death,
all difference of persons is taken away; 2.
and all nations are as acceptable to God, as the Jews were: Acts 10. 34, 35.
Of a truth I perceive, God is no accepter of persons: but in every nation, he
that fears God and works righteousness, is accepted of him, Gal. 3. 28.
For there is neither Jew nor Grecian, bond nor free, male nor female: for ye
are all one in Christ. And therefore all difference of places must needs also
be taken away. For this difference of places, was as a partition wall, between
the Jews and all the Gentiles: Ephesians. 2. 14, 15. He is our peace, which has
made of both, one, and has broken the stop of the partition wall, in
abrogating through his flesh the hatred, the law of commandment, which
stands in ordinances. 3. The grievous sins, whereby Jerusalem, and the
Temple were defiled, caused God to destroy and profane it; and of the 3.
most holy and honorable place, to make it the most miserable and abominable
of all the places of the world. For the profanation of the Temple, our Savior
tells them, they should see, Matthew. 24. 15. the abomination of desolation
(that is an abominable desolation) stand in the holy place. And for the
destruction of it, it was such as never the like happened to any place.
According as the Lord said: Ier. 26. 9. I will make this place as Shilo, and
this City a curse to all the inhabitants of the earth: So miserable a
destruction, that our Savior says, they should cry, Luke 23. 30. to the
mountains, fall on us, and to the hills, cover us. And this is reckoned to be
the cause of it: Matthew. 23. 37, 38. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the
Prophets, and stonest them that are sent to thee. How often would I have
gathered thy children together, as the Hen gathers her chickens under her
wings, and ye would not? Behold your habitation shall be left unto you
desolate. 4. The Lord has not since the destruction of the Temple and City
of Jerusalem, sanctified 4.
any other place in the world, or consecrated it to a more holy use then the
rest; and it is Gods institution and Word only, that can make any thing, or
any place holy, every creature and ordinance of God is sanctified by the Word
of God and prayer, 1. Tim. 4. 5. Nothing can be sanctified but by the Word and
prayer. The Sabbath is an holier day then all the rest; because the Lord by his
institution sanctified it: Exodus 20. 11. The Water in Baptism is holy, because
the Lord in his Word has consecrated it to that holy use; God sanctifies and
cleanses us with the washing of water by the word, Ephesians. 5. 26. The Bread and
Wine in the Lords Supper are holy, because the Lord appointed them to be used
in that holy action, he took Bread and Wine, and after he had blessed them
by his prayer and thanksgiving, used them in this holy action as signs of his
Body and Blood, and Seals of the new Covenant, Matthew. 26. 26, 27. Luke 22.

The Use of this Doctrine is threefold. 1. To reprove sundry superstitions of
the Papists, and of ignorant persons, that have by tradition received Use 1.
it from the Papists. 1. Their going on pilgrimage to the holy Land, (as they
call it) and to other places which by reason of some relics of 1.
Saints, that are said to be there, are accounted more holy then any other
places. This is counted a chief work of piety, and devotion among them. Five
Reasons there are against this superstition. 1. Nothing can make a place, or
ought else holy, but the ordinance and institution of God, as we have heard. 2.
Of all places, Jerusalem does now worst deserve the name of the holy Land. For
Numb. 35. 33. blood defiles the Land; and in it was the blood of all the
Prophets and of Christ himself shed, Matthew. 23. 37. 3. The relics of Saints,
which they pretend do make those places holier, are notoriously known to be
counterfeit. 4. If the true bodies of the Saints were indeed there, yet ought
not such religious respect to be had to those places for them. For, for this
cause the place where Moses was buried (even under the Law when some places
were holier then other) was so carefully concealed, least the people of God
should give religious respect unto it. Deuteronomy. 34. 6. Yea, Michael strove, and
disputed with the devil about this point: Jude 9. 5. It is Iudaisme and a
denial of Christ to be come, to hold that one place is holier then another, as
is evident by this Text. 2. The second superstition of Papists reproved by
this Doctrine, is this that they 2.
put more holiness in some places of burial, then in others. For they hold,
that it is more beneficial to the dead, to be buried in the Churchyard, then
out of it; and in the Church more then in the Churchyard; and in the Chancell
more then in the Church; and near the high Altar, more then in any other place
of the Chancell; and that upon this conceit, that these places are consecrated
and hallowed, that they are holier then other places are. 1. I do not deny,
but a Christian may lawfully desire to be buried in the place, where the rest
of the faithful are buried. 2. There may be more civil honor done to some
Christians, then to others, even in the place of their burial, it was an
honor lawfully done unto Hezekiah, that he was buried in the chiefest of the
Sepulchers of the sons of David, 2. Chron. 32. 33. But to put any holiness
in this thing, or to think the place where one is buried, can any way tend to
the benefit of the dead, that is gross superstition, that is most unlawful.
3. The third superstition condemned by this Doctrine is this, that they hold
private prayer made in a Church more available, 3.
(because the Church say they is a more holy place) then any other. Whereas it
is evident by that has been said, that our houses and chambers are in
themselves, as holy places, as the Churches are. 2. That for private and secret
prayer they are fitter places then any Church: When thou prayest enter into thy
closet, and when thou have shut the door, pray to thy father which is in
secret, Matthew. 6. 6. 4. The fourth superstition condemned by this Doctrine is,
that they put holiness and Religion even in the situation of their Temples, 4.
and placing of their bodies in prayer. For the Temple (say they) should be
built toward the East, and we should worship toward the East. Whereas, it is
not religiously material, which way our Churches stand, or which way we turn
our selves in prayer, so our hearts be lifted up and directed to our Father
which is in heaven. Yet if any part of Heaven be more unfit for us to turn
our faces toward in prayer then other, the East is the unfittest. Because we
find Idolaters blamed for doing so: Ezekiel 8. 16. Which we cannot find noted
of any other part. 2. Though the matter it self be of small moment, yet to
put holiness in it, is a great sin, as is evident by that bitter inuectiue
our Savior makes against the Pharisees and Jews, for the holiness they put
in washing of hands and cups and such like things, Mark 7. 6. 9.

The second Use of this Doctrine is, to exhort us, that since we have learned
that this is one chief privilege, we have by Christ's death, that all
religious difference of places is taken away, and our nation now is as holy as
Canaan, our towns as Jerusalem, our houses as the Temple, we should therefore
make use of this privilege in serving God, not in our Temples only, but in
our houses also, in establishing the exercises of Religion in our families, and
using them there constantly and conscionably. We read of Abraham, that
wheresoever he pitched his tent, he was wont to erect an Altar unto God, Genesis
12. 8. and 13. 18. And many Christians are said to have had Churches in their
houses: Romans 16. 5. Col. 4. 15. Philemon 2. Under the Law they were wont to
dedicate their houses, and consecrate them to God before they dwelt in them,
Deuteronomy. 20. 5. Psalm. 30. in titulo. Though this were done then with sundry
ceremonies, which are now abolished, yet the equity remains, and we also
should dedicate our houses unto God; and that can we do no better way then
this: 2. Sam. 6. 11. God blessed the house of Obed-edom, while the Arc was
entertained in it. And how can this choose, but bring a blessing from God upon
our dwellings; if he were served constantly in them. Contrarily, Ier. 10. 25.
There is a Prophetical imprecation against those families, wherein no prayer
is used.

The third Use of this Doctrine is, to teach us, that such is the severity of
God against sin, that he will not only plague them that commit it; Use 3.
but curse the very place where it has been committed. Jerusalem and the
House of God, may be an example to all places in the world in this point. For
what places in the world had so many privileges as Jerusalem and the Temple
there? Of which it is said, 2. Chron. 7. 16. I have now chosen and sanctified
this place, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart
shall be there perpetually: And Lam. 4. 12. The Kings of the earth, and all
the inhabitants of the world would not have believed, that the adversary and
the enemy, should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem: and yet behold how
the sins committed therein, made it the most accursed place in the world. It
is a special blessing often promised to the godly, that their habitation and
dwelling shall prosper, Pro. 3. 33. That he will make the habitation of their
righteousness prosperous, Job 8. 6. Yea that they shall know and feel, that
peace shall be in their Tabernacles, Job 5. 24. And about them, and their
houses, and all that they have, God keeps such a fence, as Satan cannot hurt
them: Job 1. 10. It is the protection of God alone, that keeps our houses from
the calamities of fire within, and lightning from heaven, and from the
annoyance and molestation of evil spirits, and other judgments. On the other
side it is certain, the curse of God is upon the habitation of the wicked,
Pro. 3. 33. and 14. 11. the house of the wicked shall be overthrown. Sin
defiles the house where it is committed, and brings Gods curse on it, the
houses upon whose roofes Idolatry had been committed shall be set on fire,
says the Lord, Ier. 32. 29. The curse shall enter into the house of the
thief, and of him that swears falsely, and it shall remain in the midst of
it, and it shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof,
Zach. 5. 4. Destruction shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of
his, brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation, Job 15. 15. O that men
would believe this! Then would Victualers, either not endure such swearing,
uncleanness, and drunkenness in their houses; or if they could not avoid it
(living in that calling) they would give it over. Then would Masters of
families not content themselves, to be themselves free from swearing,
drunkenness, and filthiness; but would put these sins far from their
Tabernacles also, as Eliphaz speaks, Job 22. 23.

Lecture the four and thirtieth, December 5. 1609.
WE have already heard that the answer which our Savior makes to the question
that this woman moved unto him, consists of two parts. The first concerns
the place of Gods worship, concerning which she desired to be resolved, and
that is set down in the 21. verse, which we finished the last day. The second
concerns the worship it self about which she moved her question; namely,
the ceremonial worship that was done to God in Jerusalem, and mount Gerizim;
and this part of his answer is contained in this part of the verse that I have
now read, and those two that follow it. The sum and effect of this part of
his answer is this: that though the worship which the Jews did to God, were
far better then that of the Samaritans; yet this ceremonial worship about
which she is now so inquisitiue, whether it were that, that the Jews used, or
that, that the Samaritans used, was not so much to be esteemed, as she
conceived; but should shortly be abolished, and in stead thereof, another form
of Gods worship should be established, which should not consist in ceremonies
and shadows (that suited so well with our carnal and corrupt nature) but
should be spiritual (as best agreeing with the nature of God) and should have
in it the truth and substance of all that which was figured and shadowed in
those ceremonies. So that these three verses divide themselves into two parts,
1. A commendation of that outward worship of God, that the Jews used in
comparison of that of the Samaritans, and that is set down in this verse. 2. A
discommendation of that outward worship of God, that the Jews used in
comparison of that, which God would shortly establish in his Church; and that
is contained in the two verses following. In this verse, he commends the
Religion and worship of God that the Jews used and prefers it before that of
the Samaritans, by this argument; because the Samaritans worshipped they knew
not what. But so did not the Jews, and that he proves, because salvation was
of the Jews. The obscurity that is in any of these words, I will clear, and
interpret it, as I come to the handling of the Doctrines that arise out of
them. 1. Then we are to observe here, that our Savior says, they worshipped
they knew not what. How could that be, seeing: 1. They knew that they
worshipped the true God, even the same God that the Jews did. For so say they
to Zerubbabel; Quest.
Ezra 4. 2. We seek JEHOVAH your God as ye do. Yea the Holy Ghost says of
them: 2. Kings 17. 3. Thus they feared the Lord, and appointed Priests, out of
themselves for the high places, who prepared for them sacrifices in the house
of the high places. 2. They knew what manner of worship they gave unto him. For
they offered sacrifices unto him: Ezra 4. 2. They served him as they were
taught and directed by one of the Priests that had served in Israel, before
they were carried away captive by the Assyrians, 2. Kings 17. 28. One of those
Priests came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should serve the
Lord. What then does our Savior mean to say, they worshipped they knew not
what? Surely, because they did not know him by his Word, they did not worship
him according to his Word. Answ.
Therefore they are said to worship they know not what. This interpretation is
grounded upon that we shall find written in 2. Kings 17. 34. They did after
the old manner, as verse 19. They neither feared God, nor did after their
ordinances, nor after their customs, nor after the Law, nor after the
commandment which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob. On the other side,
because the Jews had the Word of God, they knew God by his Word, the worship
they did to him, was appointed by his Word. Therefore are they said, to worship
what they knew. And this interpretation is further confirmed by the words that
follow: Salvation is of the Jews. For what means he by salvation? Surely the
Word, the Doctrine and means of salvation: as it is also called: Heb. 2. 5.
How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation. This was the chief
Prerogative the Jews had above others. So that these words, salvation is of
the Jews, are the very same in effect with that which the Prophet Esaias has,
Esaias 2. 3. The Law shall go from Zion, and the Word of the Lord from
Jerusalem. So that the first Doctrine we are to learn is this:

That no man can know or serve God aright without the direction of his Word.
The Doctrine has two branches. 1. No man can know God aright, Doct. 3.
nor conceive rightly of him, but by his Word. 2. No man can serve or worship
God aright, without the direction of his word. 1. The God which ignorant men
and such as are not instructed by his word do serve, is not a true God, but an
Idol and fancy of their own, Psalm. 76. 1. God is known in Judah. On the
other side it is said of all natural men: Gal. 4. 8. But even then when ye
knew not God, ye did service unto them, which by nature are not Gods. So it is
said of the ten Tribes: 2. Chron. 15. 3. Now for along season Israel has
been without the true God, because they had been without a Priest to teach,
and without the Law. True it is, God makes himself known not to his Church
only by his Word, but to all the world by his works. Men cannot open their
eyes, or look any way, but they may see him in his works, Romans 1. 20. The
invisible things of him, that is, his eternal Power and Godhead, are seen
ever since the Creation of the World, being considered in his works. Yea he
says of all the Gentiles that (verse. 21.) they knew God; and verse 19. that
which may be known of God is manifest in them, that is, in their hearts and
consciences, for (says he) God has showed it unto them. So that there is no
man living, but he has even by nature some knowledge of the true God in him.
But this is not the true knowledge of God, it is not a comfortable and saving
knowledge of him. Sundry notable differences may be observed between the
knowledge of God, men attain to by the light of nature, or by the creatures,
and that which is attained to by the Word. 1. That serves to make men only
without excuse, and cannot bring them unto salvation, Romans 1. 20. But this is
all-sufficient to make men wise unto salvation, 2. Tim. 3. 15. and therefore is
called salvation here, and Iam. 1. 21. it is said to be able to save the soul.

Secondly, that light is as a dim light, that knowledge is dark and obscure,
and uncertain, notwithstanding this knowledge they have of him by his
creatures and the light of nature, men have many strange conceits of God, and
know not what to think of him, Romans 1. 21. Though they knew God, yet they
became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish hearts were full of
darkness. But the Word reuealeth God unto us, so clearly and so certainly,
that the simplest may know him, Psalm. 19. 7. The testimony of the Lord is sure,
and gives wisdom to the simple.

Thirdly, the knowledge of God that is gotten by the creatures, has no power
to change and reform the heart, Romans 1. 21. When they knew God, they glorified
him not as God, neither were thankful: but the knowledge of God that is
gotten by the Word, has power to convert the soul, Psalm. 19. 7.

Fourthly, the knowledge of God that is gotten by other means, brings no
comfort nor joy to the soul, but works in it rather a slavish fear of him,
Eccl. 1. 14. I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and
behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit: and verse 18. in much wisdom
there is much grief, and he that increases knowledge increases sorrow, but
the knowledge of God, we attain to by the Word rejoices the heart, so as the
better we know him, the more comfort we have in him, Psalm. 19. 8. 10. So that
you see now the first branch of the Doctrine confirmed unto you, that no man
can know God aright, know him to his comfort, know him to his salvation but by
his Word. The second branch of the Doctrine shall be made as plain unto you,
that no man can worship God aright, but by the direction of his Word. No
service can please God, but that that is done by direction, and in obedience to
his Word. When the Lord had forbidden his people to serve him as the Cananites
had done, he adds, Deuteronomy. 12. 32. Whatsoever I command you, take heed you do
it; thou shall add nothing thereto, nor take ought therefrom; that is, do
neither more nor less in my service then I have appointed. Say that we do
that in his service which he has not forbidden, yet if he has not commanded
it, we highly offend him, as is plain in the case of Nadab and Abihn, They
offered strange fire before the Lord which he commanded them not, and there
went out fire from the Lord and devoured them, Leuit. 10. 1, 2. When the
Tabernacle was to be built, Moses (though a wise and holy man was not to be
trusted with any thing, but straightly charged, Heb. 8. 5. See, said he, that
thou make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the Mount.
This charge was four times repeated, Exodus 25. 9. 40. and 26. 30. and 27. 28.
And it is said when all was done. Exodus 39. 43. Moses beheld that they had done
all in every point as the Lord commanded, and he blessed them. So when mention
is made that Solomon set the courses of the Priests and singers, and of the
Porters for the House of God; least we should think he did it of his own
head; his warrant is set down, and its expressly said, For so was the
commandment of David, the man of God, 2. Chron. 8. 14. And yet more plainly,
2. Chron 29. 25. When Hezekiah appointed the Levites to use in the Church of
God, Cymbals, and Viols, and Harps, least we should think he took upon him to
appoint any thing in Gods service, its said, He did it according to the
commandment of David and Gad the Kings seer, and Nathan the Prophet. For the
commandment was by the hand of the Lord, and by the hand of his Prophets. See
how precise God would have us to be in sticking close to the direction of his
Word, in the matter of his worship. Yea it is certain, when we do him any
service, that he has not appointed us in his Word, we serve not him, but we
serve an Idol. This is plain here in the example of the Samaritans, they
intended to worship the true God, 2. Kings 17. 32. Ezra 4. 2. And yet it is
said they did not worship the true God, 2 King. 17. 34. What did they worship
then? surely an Idol of their own brain. They worshipped they knew not what.
Why so? Because they made not the Word the rule of their worship: but the
custom of the country, 2. King. 17. 34. 40. Yea while men think they serve
the Lord, they serve the devil, if the worship they do to God, be not
grounded upon his Word. This is plain in three examples.

1. It is certain, the Gentiles (as they had some knowledge of the true God,
Romans 1. 21. so) in all their superstitions they intended to worship him. For so
Paul tells the Athenians, he preached no other God to them, but the same whom
they did worship. Acts 17. 23. Yet it is said of them, 1. Cor. 10. 20. They
worshipped devils and not God. Why? because they worshipped him ignorantly,
and not according to his Word, Acts 17. 23. they serve the unknown god.

2. Aaron and the Israelites intended to worship the true God in the similitude
of the golden Calfe, as is plain, Psalm. 106. 20. They changed their glory into
the similitude of an Ox that eats grass. And Nehem. 9 ^8. This is the God
(said they) that brought thee out of the land of Egypt, and Exodus 32. 5. Aaron
made an Altar before it, and proclaimed, To morrow shall be an Holyday to
JEHOVAH. And yet the Lord for this, charge them that they had offered a burnt
offering to the devil, Leuit. 17. 7. Why? Because they were turned out of the
way that he had commanded them, They swerued from the direction of his Word,
Exodus 32. 8. they have turned quickly out of the way which I commanded.

3. The ten Tribes intended to worship the true God when they erected the two
calves, even the same God that was worshipped at Jerusalem, 1. Kings 22. 28.
Behold O Israel thy gods, (that is, the similitude of thy gods) that brought
thee out of the land of Egypt. And yet the Holy Ghost says, they served the
devil, 2. Chron. 11. 15. He ordained him Priests for the high places, and for
the devils, and for the calves that he made. And why? Because they worshipped
him not according to his Word, 2. Chron. 15. 3. Israel has been without the
true God. Why? Because without a Priest to teach and without the Law.

The Reasons of the Doctrine are these.

1. For the first branch. No man knows the Father but the Son, and Reason.
he to whom the Son will reveal him, Matthew. 11. 27. And the means 1.
whereby Christ reuealeth and makes his Father known unto us is the Word, John
17. 6. I have declared thy name to the men that thou gave me out of the
world, verse 8. For I have given unto them the Word which thou gave me.

2. For the second branch, Whatsoever is not done of faith (that is upon 2.
a persuasion we please God in it) is sin, Romans 4. 23. Now faith is grounded
upon the Word. And how can a man be persuaded he pleases God in that service
he does to him, unless he have his Word for it. For if we follow our own
good intent, while we think we please God, we may most highly offend him, the
Jews when they killed the Apostles, thought they did God good service, Ioh.
16. 2. and so did Paul when he was exceedingly mad against the faithful, and
compelled them to blaspheme, Acts 26. 11. and he says that this was then the
height of his zeal he persecuted the Church, Phil. 3. 6.

The First Use of this Doctrine is to teach us, 1. To esteem this a singular
prerogative, that the Lord has not suffered us to walk in our Use 1.
own ways, Acts 14. 16. But to be thankful that we have the Word, and to
make our use of it. This was the chief preferment of the Jew above the
Samaritan and all others, Romans 3. 1, 2. If any want this, the god that they
serve is not the true god, but an Idol, and fancy of their own, 2. Chron.
15. 3. They worship they know not what, whereas we have a comfortable
assurance that the worship we do, pleases God.

2. If therefore thou desire to serve and please God, let this be thy first
care to live under a good Ministry, and to get knowledge, Israel 2.
was without the true God, while it was without a teaching Priest, and without
the Law, 2. Chron. 15. 3. all the devotion that ignorant people use, is but the
Sacrifice of fools, till they be ready to hear and willing to be instructed
that way, Eccles. 5. 1. Therefore also the Lord complains, Hos. 4. 6. that
there is an ignorant Priest that cannot instruct them, the people perish for
want of knowledge.

3. Count it thy wisdom to cleave so precisely to the Word, as (in the matters
of Gods service) not to do any thing which thou can not find warranted by
the Word, Psalm. 119. 31. I have cleaued to thy testimonies, O Lord confound me
not.

4. Conceive no otherwise of God then he has revealed himself in his Word.

Now if we apply this to our selves, we shall find that the most of our
people are in no better case then the Samaritans were; who worshipped Applica.
they knew not what.

1. Indeed we have the whole Word of God, and so had not they. But is our case
ever the better for that? No surely it is so much the worse: they wanted it; we
have it and contemn it. We count it no prerogative to have it, we make no
benefit of it, we read it not, we seek not the knowledge of it, we care not
what Ministry we live under, we count it no benefit to live under an able
Ministry, Heb. 2. verse 3. How shall we escape if we neglect so great
salvation?

2. Though they do join with Gods people in his true worship, yet do they it
not upon this ground, that they know by the Word, God will be thus served. But
the rule they follow, is either first the commandem^nt of men, as it is said of
the Pharisees, Matthew. 15. 9. or secondly, the custom of the place where they
live, as we read the Samaritans of old did, 2. Kings 17. 40. or thirdly, their
own good meaning, contrary to that commandment, seek not after your own
heart, Numb. 15. verse 39.

The second Use is to justify our Religion against the Papists. For it is Use
2.
evident we may truly say to them as our Savior does here: Ye worship that
which ye know not, we worship that which we know. 1. It is not possible they
should have any assurance, that they please God in that service they do unto
him (how confident soever they seem to be) because they do not worship God
according to his Word. 2. While they think they worship God, they worship the
devil. Of them certainly that is spoken, Apoc. 9. 20. And the remnant of men
which were not killed by these plagues, repented not of the works of their
hands that they (...) not worship devils, and Idols of gold and silver, and of
brass and of st^ne, and of wood, which neither can see, nor bear, nor go.
For if the Israelites in Aarons and Ieroboams time, were truly said to worship
devils, when they worshipped the true God under the similitude of a molten
Image; then is their worshipping of Images no better then Idolatry, and
worshipping of devils, notwithstanding that they say, that they neither
worship the Image it self, nor any false god in or by it. The worshipping of
the Virgin Mary, as well as the worshipping of Venu^, or any of the heathen
gods; the kneeling before the picture of God the Father, or Christ crucified,
as well as the kneeling before Baal, is a worshipping of devils.

Lecture the five and thirtieth, December 12. 1609.
IN this Verse as we have heard, three things offer themselves to our (...).

1. The fault he finds with the Samaritans worship, Ye worship that wh^h y^e
know not.

2. The commendation he gives to the Jews worship, we worship that we know.

3. The reason whereby he justifies this commendation, he gives to the Jews.
For salvation is of the Jews, It follows now that we proceed to the two last
points contained in these words, We worship that we know* for salvation is of
the Jews. In which words for the help of our memory and understanding, three
things are to be observed. 1. That Christ prof sieth of himself that he
worshipped God. 2. That he worshipped God as the Jews did. 3. That he
affirms salvation is of the Jews. Then the first Doctrine that we have here
to learn, is this;

That our Savior himself, though he were the Son of God, did use when he
was here on earth to serve and worship God. 1. He was wont Doct. 4.
diligently to frequent the place of public prayer, Luke 4. 16. He went into
the Synagogue on the Sabbath day as his custom was. 2. He was wont to use
prayer in his own family, Luke 9. 18. As he was alone praying, his Disciples
were with him. 3. He was wont always at his meals to give thanks, and pray
to God for his blessing upon the creatures, and that (not only when he was to
work a miracle, Matthew 14. 19. He (...) up to heaven and blessed the food that
was prepared, that is, gave thanks and prayed) but ordinarily, Luke 24. 30. As
he sat at table, he took the bread and gave thanks. 4. Besides all these
kinds of prayer, he was wont to pray in secret, and by himself, Luke 5. ^6. He
kept himself apart in the wilderness and prayed; he used this kind of praying
in the morning, Ma^e 1. 35. In the morning very early before day he arose, and
went out into a solitary place and there prayed. He used it also in the
evening, Matthew. 14* ^3. He went up into a mountain alone (having no house of
his own^, he was wont to go abroad into the most solitary place) to pray, and
when the Evening was come, he was there alone. Yea this was his custom, Luke
22. 39. He went as he was wont to the Mount of Olives. 5. He was wont to
perform this worship of God with gestures and signs of as much reverence,
humility and submission, as we shall read any of Gods servants have been wont
to do, Luke 2^. 41. He knecled down and prayed, Matthew 26. 39. He fell on his
face and prayed.

The Reason why he was thus diligent in worshipping God, wa^ not so much for
his own sake, as for us. For he had no need to pray, for he had Reason.
all creatures in heaven and earth at command; and by his word was able to do
what pleased him, Matthew. 8. 8, 9. Speak the word only, and (...) (...) shall
be healed. For I am a man also in authority, etc. Why then did he thus use to
worship God? surely for our sake only, and not for himself, but in respect of
us. Three Reasons there were for it.

1. That he might purchase to us eternal life, it was necessary he should
perfectly keep the law: for thus runs the Covenant, Matthew. 19. 17. If thou 1.
wilt enter into life, keep the commandments, yea perfectly Gal (...). 1^.
This we were not able to do, therefore he, Gal. 4 4, 5. Was made under the Law
that he might redeem them that are under the Law, that we might receive the
adoption of sons. Therefore it became him to fulfill all righteousness
Matthew. 7 5. And this is a chief part of that righteousness God requires of
us in his law that we worship him, Mat. 22. 38. This is the first and the great
comm^ndement.

2. That he might give us an example: for that which he speaks of one of his
actions, may be said of all that he did in obedience to the moral Law, John
13. 15. I have given you an example that you should do as I have done.

3. That he might obtain for us the Spirit of God, whereby we may be made able
to do the like, For as the disobedience of Adam, deserved that all his
posterity should loose the Image of God, and become like unto him, Romans 5. 22.
By one man sin entered into the world; so the active obedience of Christ has
deserved that God should renew his Image in all the faithful, and give them
his quickening spirit, Romans 8. 2. the Law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
has made me free from the law of sin and of death.

The Use of this Doctrine, is to stir every one of us up to a greater
conscience and diligence in all the duties of Gods worship, specially in
prayer. Use.
For if the Son of God (that had not such need to do it in respect of
himself) yet used it so constantly, and used it only because the Law requires
it of us, and that he might make himself an example to us; and that he might
obtain grace for us to do it; what excuse can we (that are bound unto it by
Gods Law, and stand in such need of it) have for our ordinary neglect of
public prayer, of prayer with our family, of secret and private prayer.

2 The second thing we are to observe here, is this, that our Savior in
commending the worship and Religion of the Jews, makes himself one of their
number, acknowledges himself a member of their Church, professes that
himself did worship God as they did; from whence this Doctrine arises for our
instruction;

That those assemblies that enjoy the Word and Doctrine of salvation, though
they have many corruptions remaining in them are to be acknowledged Doct. 1.
the true Churches of God, and such as none of the faithful may make
separation from. We shall need no further proof of this Doctrine then the
example of our Savior himself. If we consider on the one side how corrupt the
State of the Jews Church was in his time, and on the other side how far
forth our Savior did communicate with them in the service of God.

1. For the first, what the state of that Church was in his time, we may know
if we consider, 1. What the Priests and teachers were themselves that had the
ordering of Gods worship. 2. What the people were, with whom he was to join in
Gods worship. 3. What the worship it self was, wherein he was to communicate.

1. The Priests and teachers, 1. Were ignorant and unlearned, Matthew. 23. 16. 2.
They were wicked and ungodly, Matthew. 23. 3. 3. They had a corrupt and unlawful
entrance into their calling, yea even the high Priest himself. For whereas by
Gods ordinance he was to hold that office during his life; this office was
bought and sold, and made annual, John 11. 49. Caiphas was high Priest for
that year.

2. And what were the people? Surely the most of them in all places where he
conuersed, were notoriously and obstinately wicked. In Nazaret where he had
lived most, see what they were, Luke 4. 28, 29. All that were in the Synagogue
when they heard this Doctrine, were filled with wrath, and rose up and thrust
him out of the City, and lead him to the edge of an hill to cast him down
headlong. But were they better in other places? No, he vpbraided all the
Cities, where most of his great works were done, Woe be to thee Corazin, woe
be to thee Bethsaida, Matthew. 11. 20, 21. And were the people of Jerusalem any
better? you shall perceive that by that affection they showed at the Passion of
our Savior. When Pilate a Gentile had made such an offer to them, Luke 23. 18.
All the multitude cried at once, not him but Barrabas, and Matthew. 27. 25. When
Pilate had washed his hands and protested for Christ innocence, then answered
all the people and said desperately, his blood b^ on us and our children.

3. The worship it self that was used in that Church had many corruptions in
it. 1. They used many superstitious ceremonies, the observation whereof they
urged more strictly then the commandments and ordinances of God, Mar. 7. 9. 2.
The Temple was profaned and made a den of thieves, Matthew. 2^. 12, 13. 3. The
discipline and censures of the Church were shamefully abused, John (...). 22.
The Jews had decreed that if any did confess that Jesus was the Christ, he
should be excommunicated, ipsofacto. 4. The Doctrine was corrupt in many
points, as you shall find, Matthew. 5. 2^. 48. 5. Some corruption also was crept
into the administration of the Sacraments. For they kept it a day after our
Savior, (who observed the just time appointed by God) John 19. 14. the day of
his Passion was but the day of the preparation to the Passover. Thus we have
seen how corrupt the state of the Church was. And yet mark how our Savior
made no separation from it, but communicated with it in the worship of God. 1.
When he was an infant he was circumcised, and by that Sacrament incorporated
into that Church, Luke 2. 21. 2. When his mother was purified, he was brought
to the Temple and presented to the Lord, and an oblation was given for him, as
for other children, Luke 2. 22. 3. He was content to be an hearer of such
teachers as taught in that Church, Luke 2. 46. 4. He was every Sabbath wont to
join in public prayer with the Congregation that was at Nazaret, Luke 4. 16.
5. He received the Sacrament of Baptism in a Congregation of that people, Luke
3. 21. When all the people was baptized, he was baptized also. 6. He
communicated in the Passover with the people, and the Priests, John 2. 13. 7.
He allowed his Disciples to hear those teachers, Matthew. 23. 12. Yea he
commanded the Leper whom he cleansed, to go and show himself to the Priest,
and offer his gift in the Temple, Matthew. 8. 4.

The Reasons why all men are bound to count such assemblies the true Churches
as enjoy the Word and Doctrine of salvation, and may not separate Reason.
from them for their corruptions, are these.

1. So long as God continues his Word and the Doctrine of salvation to a
people, so long it is evident God dwells among them, and has not forsaken 1.
them, I will set my Tabernacle among you (by which he means his solemn
worship, whereof this is a principal part, Leuit. 26. 11, 12.) and my soul
shall not abhor you. And I will walk among you, and I will be your God, and
ye shall be my people. In Judah God is known, his name is great in Israel.
Psalm. 76. 12. In Salem also is his Tabernacle and his dwelling place in Sion.
And till God has forsaken a Church, no man may forsake it. For shall we be
holier and hate corruption more then the Lord? It is no sufficient warrant for
any to separate from a Church, because it is guilty of such sins and
corruptions as deserve God should forsake it; and for which God in his Word
has threatened that he will forsake it: till it may appear unto us God has
indeed forsaken it, and put in execution that which he has justly threatened
against it, no man may forsake it. Though adultery (either in the man or the
wife) give just cause of separation, and that the bond of wedlock should be
broken, so as the innocent party may justly forsake the offender, yet till a
bill of diuorcement have passed between them, they remain still man and wife,
notwithstanding that sin, the woman whom her husband had wronged in this
kind, is called his wife, Mal. 2. 15. Esau had justly deserved to loose the
prerogative of his birthright and superiority he had over his brother when he
had despised it and fold it, Genesis 25. 34. and Saul to be deprived of his
Kingdom; yea God by his decree and oracle had said of Esau and Jacob, The
elder shall serve the younger, Genesis 25. 23. And of Saul and David, that he had
rejected the one, and appointed the other to reign in his stead, 1. Sam. 13.
14. and 15. 23. 26. 28, And yet till the Lord saw it good to put this his
decree and oracle in execution, and actually to depose the one from his
birthright, and the other from his Kingdom, Jacob acknowledges Esau his Lord
and superior, Genesis 32. 4, 5. and so did David, Saul, 1. Sam. 24. 7. 9. So
though a Church for the many corruptions that are in it, be unworthy the name
of Christ's Church, and be also such as the Lord has threatened to make no
Church, yet till the Lord has put this his threat in execution, and taken away
his tabernacle and worship from it; it is still to be acknowledged and
reverenced as the Church of Christ. Use.


2. Because no separation may be made from those assemblies, where men may be
assured to find and attain to salvation, Lord to whom shall we go, thou have
the words of eternal life, says Peter unto our Savior, accounting this a
sufficient reason why they might not leave him, John 6. 68. But men may be sure
to find and attain to salvation in such assemblies where the Ministry of the
Word, and the Doctrine of salvation is continued. For the Word and Gospel of
Christ is called salvation here, and Heb. 2. 3. Because it is the ordinary
means ordained of God to bring men to salvation, Romans 1. 16. 1. Cor. 1. 21.
Yea it is at one time or other effectual in all Gods Elect that do enjoy it,
Iam. 1. 21. calls it the engrafted Word which is able to save your souls.

To teach us what to judge of our Church, and of the Brownists, that separate
themselves from it. 1. We may not deny, but that there is just cause Use 1.
of fear, that God may take away his Tabernacle from amongst us, and remove
our Candlestick: Even the general decay of our first love may cause us to to
fear it: Apoc. 2. 5. And the great neglect of the Church censures upon
scandalous offenders, in respect of that the Apostle says, know ye not that a
little leaven leaueneth the whole lump, 1. Cor. 5. 6. But specially the
general increase of all filthy and abominable sins in the land, Thy Camp
shall be holy, that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee,
Deuteronomy. 32. 14. see thou not (says the Lord, Ezekiel. 8. 6.) the great
abominations that the house of Israel commits here, that I should go far
off from my Sanctuary? 2. Though we acknowledge our Church to be a true Church,
yet may we not communicate with it in any corruptions, that shall be detected
or approved to be in it. Herein we have our Saviors example to guide us.
Though he esteemed the Church of the Jews to be a true Church, and joined with
it in Gods worship, yet would he not communicate with it in the least
corruption. He would not use so much as their superstitious purifications;
Mark 7. 6, 7. When they put off the Passover a day longer then God had
appointed, he would not join with them in that; Matthew. 26. 17. 3. We should
mourn for, and show our dislike to those things that are evil in our Church,
so did the faithful before the captivity, Ezekiel. 9. 4. So did Christ, Luke 19.
41. But we may not separate our selves, nor deny it to be a true Church for the
reasons above alleged.

2. To convince the Papists of error, in their doctrine touching the notes of
the true Church. None of their notes are proper and infallible; for the
profession 2.
and preaching of the true Doctrine in all fundamental points is the only
proper and certain note of the true Church: as we see here in the argument
Christ uses to prove the Church and worship of the Jews, to be the true
worship and Church of God. For salvation is of the Jews. This was the chief
privilege, the chief badge and cognizance of the old Church, that the Oracles
of God were committed to them, they enjoyed the true Doctrine of salvation,
Psalm. 147. 19, 20. Romans 3. 2. And thus does the Apostle describe the true
Church under the Gospel; he calls it the household of God built upon the
foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself, being the
chief Cornerstone, Ephesians. 2. 19, 20. He calls it also the pillar and ground
of truth, 1. Tim. 3. 25.

Lecture the six and thirtieth, December 26. 1609.
THe two first parts of this Verse we have already finished, and are now to
proceed to the third and last. viz. The Reason whereby Christ justifies the
worship which the Jews did unto God, in these words: Salvation is of the
Jews: wherein two things are to be observed. 1. What he means here by
Salvation. 2. How this Salvation that he speaks of is said to be of the
Jews. By Salvation in this place is meant the Word of God, and the Ministry
thereof, as may appear by these three Reasons. 1. The Salvation here spoken
of, is that whereby the Jews knew how to worship God aright; else there had
been no consequence in this Reason, we worship that we know: For salvation
is of the Jews, q. d. Because we have Salvation. Now the only means whereby
the Jews knew how to worship God aright, was the Word. 2. This Salvation here
spoken of, was the chief prerogative whereby the Lord did prefer the Jew
before the Samaritan, and all other nations, and so is it mentioned here. And
the chief prerogative of the Jews was the Word, Psalm. 147. 19. He shows
his Word to Jacob, his statutes and his judgments to Israel (verse 20.) He
has not done so with any other nation, neither have they known his
judgments. And Romans 3. 2. The chief preferment of the Jew was this, because
to them were committed the Oracles of God. 3. The salvation here spoken of, is
that that was to be derived from the Jews to Gods people of all nations. And
what was that? The Law shall go from Zion, and the Word of the Lord from
Jerusalem, Esaias 2. 3. And the reason why it is so called, is, for that it
works the salvation of men: Which teaches us;

That the Word of God, and the Ministry thereof, is the salvation of men. See
for proof of this, what titles are given to it by the Holy Ghost. Doct. 6.
1. It is called the Word of grace, Acts 20. 32. 2. It is called the Word of
life, Phil. 2. 16. John 6. 68. 3. It is called the grace of God, Titus 2. 11.
4. The Kingdom of God: Matthew. 21. 43. The Kingdom of God shall be taken away
from you, and given to a nation, etc. 5. Salvation it self and everlasting
life here, and Heb. 2. 3. Act. 28. 28. John 12. 50. I know that his
commandment (that is, his Word which he has commanded me to teach) is
everlasting life. These are improper and strange speeches to be spoken of the
Word; yet are they far more effectual to set out the dignity and excellency
of the Word, then if the Lord should have said only in plain terms, that it
is the means and worker of our salvation. Before I come to show the Reasons
why it is so called, I will answer three questions and doubts that may arise in
your minds, which may hinder you from understanding aright, and conceiving the
meaning of this Doctrine.

1. Can none be saved that want the Word? Quest. 1.


To this I answer. It cannot be denied but some have attained to salvation Answ.
that never enjoyed the Word. Neither must we imagine that God either could
not, nor never did save any without the Word; or that all they are to be judged
to be in the state of damnation, that either in times past, or at this day live
and die in those places where the light of the Word did never shine. For God is
able to do whatsoever it pleases him, Psalm. 115. 2. He has appointed means
not to tie himself, but us only unto them: and as the invisible Church (the
company of Gods Elect) is a Catholic Church in all ages, and in all places;
so in such times and places as he has denied the Word unto, he has been wont
to save his Elect without the Word. While his people were in the wilderness,
where they could not have the ordinary means of tillage, God did feed them
extraordinarily, and gave them bread from heaven, John 6. 31. So Rahab had
faith even while she dwelt in Jericho, Heb. 11. 31. And the Wise men of the
East, before they came to Iudaea, Matthew. 2. 2.

2. Shall all be saved that have the Word? that read it, that hear it, Quest.
2.
that profess it?

To this I answer. That it is certain, all are not saved that enjoy the Word.
For in all ages, there have been many that have lived under Answ.
most faithful and profitable Ministers, and have heard them also ordinarily,
and yet have not been saved: such an one was Judas, John 6. 70. Yea the most
part of them that have enjoyed the Word, have missed of salvation. In so much
as in all ages, the best of Gods servants have had cause to complain, as: Esaias
53. 1. Who will believe our report? And to whom is the arm of God revealed?
Yea, it may well be, that those that have enjoyed the Word most abundantly, may
be far worse men for all kind of wickedness, then such as never heard the
Word in their lives. So it is said of Jerusalem, that it exceeded Sodom in all
kind of abominations: Ezekiel. 16. 48. The Word uses not to save any, unless it
be by preaching opened and applied, Acts 8. 31. 1. Cor. 1. 21. For it saues
none but such as can understand, believe, and obey it. It saves none but Gods
Elect. Only those that God has ordained unto life shall profit by it, shall
find it effectual to their salvation: Acts 13. 48. The rest cannot profit by
it, Many are called but few are chosen, Matthew. 22. 14. The rest shall be made
worse by it. The Word of God is like unto the water of jealousy, mentioned,
Numb. 5. 27. 28. When it is received into an honest and good heart, it does it
good and makes it fruitful; when into a corrupt heart it rotts it, and makes
it worse.

3. Is the salvation of any to be ascribed to the Word it self, or any virtue
that is in it? Quest. 3.


To this I answer. That 1. The salvation even of those that are saved by the
Word, is not to be ascribed to the Word it self, or any virtue Answ.
that is in it; as if it were to be accounted the author and worker of any man's
salvation. 1. The glory of this work is to be ascribed wholly unto God: the
Word is but the instrument that God is pleased to use in this work. God only
is our Savior: 1. Tim. 2. 3. 2. Neither is it as a natural instrument that
has virtue in it self to regenerate or save (as food has to nourish, and a
medicine to heal the body) but only as a tool God is pleased to use in this
work: So that as the excellentest tool the Ioyner has, or uses, can work
nothing unless his hand go with it, and work with it. So is it in this case.
The Word saues and regenerates men not by any natural virtue that is in it,
but only by a supernatural power it receives from God, the weapons of our
warfare are mighty through God, 2. Cor. 10. 4. Nay the Word it self, say it be
delivered in the Ministry of a man that has the most excellent gifts, is not
able to work the least measure of saving grace in the heart of any. A man
would think it was no great degree of grace in Lydia, that she attended to
the thing that Paul spoke, yet could not the word that Paul spoke (though he
had such excellent gifts) work so much, but God opened her heart, Acts 16. 14.
To come to Christ, is the least measure and degree of saving faith; yet could
not the word that Christ himself spoke (as he was man) move a soul so far;
this is the only work of God, No man can come to me, unless my Father draw
him, John 6. 44, 45. I have planted, says Paul, and Apollos watered, but God
gave the increase, 1, Cor. 3. 6. The Preacher (if he desire his Ministry should
do good) had need to cry to God for his help, and the hearer if he desire to
profit by the Word, had need to cry to God to make his Word effectual to his
salvation. Therefore Christ (when he was to send forth his Apostles) spent a
whole night in praying to God for his blessing upon their Ministry, Luke 6. 12.
And doubtless one chief cause why the Word saues so few, is this, that men
rest too much upon it, and cry not earnestly to God, that he would bless it,
and make it effectual in their hearts.

This being so, it may be demanded why the Word should be called the Word of
life, the Kingdom of God, the salvation of men.

The Reasons why these glorious titles are given unto it by the Holy Ghost, are
these. Reason.


1. Because it is the only means the Lord has sanctified to work saving
grace in his elect, and to bring them to eternal life. Though where 1.
this cannot be had he does save by other means, or without means, as
pleases him; yet has he not said nor revealed that he will save men by any
other means then this; which caused the Apostle to move that strange
question: How shall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? or how
shall they hear without a Preacher? Romans 10. 14. And to pronounce of all that
are strangers from the covenants of promise, that they have no hope of
salvation, Ephesians. 2. 12. 2. Though men may have many good things in them
without the Word, the Gentiles which have not the law, do by nature the things
contained in the Law, Romans 2. 14. yet saving grace, such good things as may
bring a man to salvation, none can attain to ordinarily but by the Word, for
that is the incorruptible seed whereby we are regenerated, 2. Pet. 1. 23. 3.
Though there be many other means of salvation besides this, yet all the rest
receive their force and virtue from this, nothing can do us good without this.
1. Meditation of the works of God, must be acknowledged to be a good means of
grace, and so of salvation, David made great use of it to further himself in
grace, Psalm. 8. 3, 4. But no man can profit by that, till he have first
profited by the Word, Make me to understand the way of thy precepts, and I
will meditate in thy wondrous works, Psalm. 119. 27. 2 Affliction is a great
furtherance to our salvation, He chasteneth us for our profit, that we may be
partakers of his holiness, Heb. 12. 10. But it can do us no good till it be
sanctified to us by the Word, Psalm. 94. 12. Blessed is the man whom thou
chastisest, O Lord, and teach him in thy Law. 3. The Sacraments are great
helps to our salvation, 1, Pet. 3. 21. Baptism saves us. The Bread that we
break is it not the Communion of the body of Christ, 1. Cor. 10. 16. but they
have all their efficacy from the Word. Christ sanctifies and cleanses his
Church by the washing of water through the Word, Ephesians. 5. 26. and that was the
cause why Paul in that Congregation, that was assembled principally for the
celebration of the Lords Supper, spent so much time in preaching, Asts 20. 7.
4. Prayer is an excellent means of salvation, Whosoever shall call upon the
name of the Lord shall be saved, Romans 10. 13. But no man can pray with
comfort, till the Word has wrought with him, How shall they call on him, in
whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him, of whom they
have not heard? Romans 10. 14. Till the Lord has first said to a man by his
Word, thou art my child, he can never say to God in his prayer thou art my
father, Zach. 13. 9. I will say it is my people, and they shall say, the Lord
is my God.

2. Because it is ever powerful: God ever uses to make it effectual unto the
salvation of his Elect. This may appear in two points.

1. Though it be sometimes sent in judgment, and to be a savor of death unto
death in some, Go and tell this people, hear ye indeed but understand not; 2.
and see ye indeed but perceive not; Make the heart of this people fat, etc.
Esaias 6. 9, 10. yet was it never sent to any place only in judgment, only to
harden; but to work the salvation of some. When God sent Paul to Corinth, and
continued his liberty there but one year and an half, The reason is given,
Acts 18. 10. That God had Much people in that place. The like we shall find
noted of all places the Apostles preached in, that some were converted by them
in every place.

2. In Gods Elect it will certainly be effectual to their salvation, as many
as were ordained to eternal life believed, Acts 13. 48. And though not at the
first, yet it will be effectual one day, as the doctrine that John the Baptist
taught became effectual in sundry of his hearers after his death and not
before, John 10. 41, 42. And when this will not save and convert, nothing will
be able to do it, If they hear not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they
be persuaded, though one rose from the dead, Luke 16. 31. Therefore is so much
spoken of the power and efficacy of the Word, that it is lively and mighty in
operation, Heb. 4. 12. that it conuerteth the soul, Psalm. 19. 7. that it is
the power of God unto salvation, Romans 1. 16. that it is able to save our
souls, James 1. 21. that it is able to make us wise unto salvation, 2. Tim. 3.
15.

This power and ability that is in the Word to save, may be seen in four
cases.

1. It is able to enlighten and bring unto saving knowledge, the simplest that
shall hear and read it with an honest heart: Psalm. 19. 7. and 119. 130.

2. It is able to reform the heart and life of him, that has the strongest
corruptions, and greatest temptations, if he give himself to the hearing and
reading of it with a good heart, even the young man may reform his ways, if
he would take heed to them according to the word, Psalm. 119. 9.

3. It is able to comfort and revive the heart that is most cast down, either
with inward or outward afflictions, I create the fruit of the lips, (the lively
voice of the Ministry) peace, peace, (to be the mean of abundant and constant
peace) to him that is far off, and to him that is near, (to every one of
mine Elect both Gentile and Jew) says the Lord, and I will heal him, Esaias 57.
19.

4. It is able to preserve and add knowledge and grace to them that have best
profited, I commend you to God and to the Word of his grace, which is able to
build you up, Acts 20. 32. And Mark 4. 24. to you that hear shall more be
given.

3. Because it is the only evidence that we have to show, and whereby we
claim eternal life, and whereby also we may be able to hold and 3.
defend the right we have unto it, against Satan himself: Psalm. 119. 111. Thy
Testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever. As the deeds and evidence of
mine eternal inheritance. The truth of this appears in two points. 1. It is
the only ground of our faith, and is therefore called the Word of faith: Romans
10. 8. Whatsoever we believe concerning our eternal salvation, is but a
deceivable fancy, unless it be grounded upon the Word. Unless by the Word
we know, that Jesus Christ the Son of God has satisfied Gods justice for us:
that through him we have obtained remission of all our sins, we can never
have any comfort in the hope of our salvation, through the patience and comfort
of the Scriptures, we come to true hope, Romans 15. 4. When the Apostle Peter had
spoken, 2. Pet. 1. of the ground of all that he had taught the Church
concerning Christ and their salvation, and said, verse 16. he had not followed
therein, cunningly devised fables (such as many of the chief points of
devotion in the Roman Church which pretends to be built upon Peter, is
grounded upon) he tells them, verse 19. what is the sure rule and ground to be
followed and rested upon in this case, We have (says he) a more sure word of
Prophecy, etc. And as it is the only ground of our faith: so is it, Secondly,
the only Touchstone whereby we may try, and surely know, that we are in the
right way to salvation: whether our faith, repentance, love and works be such,
as God will accept of, John 3. 21. by our coming unto this light our deeds
shall be made manifest that they are wrought according to God and by no other
way.

Lecture the seven and thirtieth, January 2. 1609.
IT remains now, that we make Use of the former Doctrine, and so proceed to
finish that, which remains in this Text.

The Doctrine which we heard the last day serves principally for two Uses.

First, to work in every one of us an high estimation, and love of the Word of
God. Every man desires to be saved. And indeed, what is all Use 1.
our wealth, and bravery, and mirth, we enjoy here, if in the end our souls be
not saved? Matthew. 16. 26. Well, as thou esteemest, and love, and desire the
salvation of thy soul: so must thou esteem of the Word of God. The Word (as
thou have heard) is the salvation of man. It is the only evidence any man can
have to show, for his eternal inheritance. It is the field wherein this
inestimable treasure of eternal life is to be found: John 5, 39. Search the
Scriptures for in them ye look to find eternal life. It is able to make
thee wise unto salvation, how simple soever thou be. It is able to convert thy
soul, and reform thy life, how strong soever thy corruptions or tentations
be. It is able to give thee comfort in any affliction, how bitter, or heavy
soever they be Yea, if ever thou be saved, the Word must save thee. There is
nothing under heaven, so necessary: nothing that we may not better want, then
the Word. This is the thing our Savior spoke of, when he said, Luke 10. 42.
One thing is needful, Mary has chosen the better part, etc. If God have given
thee a heart to believe this: thou will esteem of it as David did: Psalm. 119.
72. The Law of thy mouth is better to me then thousands of gold and silver. And
verse 97. O how love I thy Law. So that of all such as care not for the Word, I
may boldly say: as, Psalm. 119. 155. Salvation is far from the wicked, for
they seek not thy statutes. And Acts 13. 46. They that put it from them, judge
themselves unworthy of everlasting life.

Now, because every man pretends that he esteems highly of the Word: and
there is no man so vile (will some say) but he loves the Word. I will give you
some notes, whereby men may try whether they esteem of Gods Word as they
ought, and love it indeed.

1. He that esteems the Word as he ought, will hear it when he may: not only
sometimes, when he has nothing to do else, but constantly, as his chief
work; and for the love of it, neglect other things: this is that that Solomon
says: Pro. 23. 23. Buy the truth and sell it not. By this note our Savior
commends Mary (not as for doing more then she was bound to do, but) for
esteeming of the Word as she ought; Luke 10. 42. Not only they that will not
hear it at all, but they that hear it seldom, that suffer every worldly
business and occasion to withdraw them from it: will be found not to have
esteemed it; Heb. 2. 3. How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation.

2. He that esteems the Word as he ought, will exercise himself in the
reading of it. Though he be an ordinary hearer of the best Ministry under
heaven, yet he must not rest in that, but exercise himself in the reading of
it: get him a Bible, and either read it himself, or get some other to read
it to him. It is a commandment that God lays upon the King himself, that
(though he above all others might best plead want of leisure) though he
enjoyed the ordinary Ministry of the Prophets, and Levites, and Priests, (as we
know that David had both Nathan and Gad) yet must he have his Bible with him,
wheresoever he went; and every day read in it, it shall be with him, and he
shall read therein all the days of his life, Deuteronomy. 17, 19, 20. And mark the
reasons there given for this, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to
keep all the words of this Law, and these Statutes, to do them: That his
heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the
Commandment, etc. It was Jobs comfort in his affliction, that he could say he
had esteemed Gods Word more then his appointed food, Job 23. 12. More duly
then he kept his meals, did he tie himself to the reading, and meditation of
it. Such then as will not get them Bibles: have money to spare many other ways
unnecessarily, but none to spare to buy them Bibles, out of doubt esteem not
of the Word as they ought to do. Men count it their shame if they have not
furniture in their houses, not only for their necessity, but even for
ornament, and decency; or if they should come to Church in indecent apparel:
but Christians should count it a greater shame to be without a Bible in their
house, to come to Church without their Bibles; I mean such as may conveniently
enough bring them with them. Nay, say men have Bibles, yet if they read not in
them: say they read sometimes, yet if they read not constantly, if they set
not themselves times for this duty, certainly they esteem not of the
excellency, and necessity of the Word, as they ought: they shall want that
comfort in their affliction that Job had. How shall we escape Gods wrath for
this wilful negligence, for this neglect of so great salvation? Heb. 2. 3. I
know Christians pretend for their excuse.

That 1. They can find no time: they have no leisure. Object. 1.


But the true cause why they have no leisure, is that their hearts esteem Answ.
not of the necessity of this duty, as they ought, they take no delight in it,
they savor it not, if they did, they could find time to read it oftener then
they do.

2. That they cannot understand it, it is so dark, that they cannot read it
Object. 2.
with delight.

But this will not excuse thee. For 1. Many books of Scripture are plain Answ.
and easy. 2. If the fault were not in thine own heart, they would not seem
so difficult to thee. Pro. 8. 9. They are plain to him that understands. 3.
Even those places thou can not understand, it is profitable for thee to
read; and when thou shall hear them interpreted in the Ministry of the Word,
it will be an advantage to thee, that thou have read them before: as we may see
in that example, When Christ was risen from the dead, his Disciples remembered
that he had said this unto them, and they believed the Scripture and the word
which Jesus had said, John 2. 22.

3. He that esteems, and loves the Word as he ought, will read it, and hear
it with great diligence, desire, and care to profit by it: Hebrews 2. 1. We
ought diligently to take heed to the things which we have heard, least at any
time we should let them slip. The Word (as I told you) is the field wherein
the treasure of our salvation is hid: but they that desire to find this
treasure, must search for it: John 5. 39. To this end four duties are enjoined
by the Lord. 1. Before our hearing, and reading we must prepare our selves.
They that desire the sincere milk of the Word that they may grow thereby; will
first lay aside all their carnal and corrupt affections; 1. Pet. 2. 1, 2. 2.
When we have heard or read it, we must meditate upon it, ponder, and think
of it, that we may understand it, be affected with it, remember it and put it
to use. David makes this a note of a happy man, Psalm. (...). 2. And of
himself he says, Psalm. 119 15. I will meditate in thy precepts, and consider
thy ways: and he adds two fruits of it, verse 16. 1. I will delight in thy
statutes. 2. I will not forget thy Word. 3. We must delight to talk and
confer of it with others: Deuteronomy. 6. 7. Thou shall rehearse them continually to
thy children, and talk of them in thy house, and by the way. Josh. 1. 8. This
book shall not depart out of thy mouth. 4. We must cry to God by prayer that
he would teach us to profit by it. As David does often, Psalm. 119. 18. 33.

They that hear, and read the Word ordinarily, but without all care to profit
by it; never use any preparation before, never meditate nor think of it after,
take no delight to talk, or confer of it, never pray that they may profit,
doubtless esteem not, nor love the Word as they ought to do.

4. He that esteems, and loves the Word as he ought, will make it the rule,
and guide of his life, will be directed and guided by it, yea, will be afraid
to transgress it, Psalm. 119. 24. Thy testimonies are my delight, and my
Counselors. He was wont to take nothing in hand, but he would first advise,
and consult with the Word. Yea, Psalm. 119. 161. When Princes did persecute him
without cause, his heart (he says) stood in awe of Gods Word. He had rather
have them against him, then to have Gods Word against him. It is noted for a
property of Gods Elect to tremble at his Word, Esaias 66. 3. So that though a man
hear, and read the Word never so ordinarily, and say he profess great love
to it, yet if he will not be ruled, and reformed by it, if he will live as he
list, if he bear that mind, that let the Lord forbear to punish him (though
the Word be against him) he cares not. Certainly he loves not the Word, nor
esteems of it as he ought to do.

The second Use of this Doctrine is, to teach us to examine those good things
that seem to be in us, whether they be such as do accompany salvation; Use 2.
such as may give a man any assurance of his salvation in the day of trial:
the Apostle calls upon the faithful themselves, to examine themselves, 2. Corinthians. 13. 15. And Galat. 6. 4. Let every man prove his own work.

Here are two rules given us in this Doctrine, whereby we may be much helped in
this case.

1. The Word is the only worker of every saving grace, we are borne again of
the incorruptible seed by the Word of God, 1. Pet. 1. 23. There may be many
good things in a natural man: Romans 2. 14. A Gentile without the Law, may do
the things contained in the Law. 1. He may make conscience of many sins, Luke
18. 11. The Pharisee could say he was no extortioner, no adulterer. 2. He may
do the works of justice. Luk 18. 12. The Pharisee could say he gave tithe of
all that he possessed. 3. He may do the works of mercy, Matthew. 6. 2. The
Hypocrite gave alms in Synagogues, and streets, and had a trumpet blown
before him which he would never have done, if his alms had not been large and
bountiful. 4. He may do good works of piety, Matthew. 6. 5. The Hypocrites
used to pray in the Synagogues, and corners of the street. 5. He may be a good
neighbor: a kind and thankful man to his friend, Matthew. 5. 46, 47. The
Publicans were such. 6. He may be apt enough to forgive an enemy, 1. Kings
20. 32. Ahab when he saw his enemy Benhadad humble himself, and seek his
favor, forgave him presently, and used him kindly. Now these civil virtues
are in themselves very good things, for God in his Law requires them: Yet can
none of all these civil virtues, yield the natural man any true comfort, nor
give him assurance that he is in the state of salvation. Why so? They are but
the fruits of the flesh, they are not the fruits of the Spirit: because they
are not wrought in him by the Word. Unless a man can say, the Word has
brought me to make conscience of these and these things, which before I made no
conscience of: these works of justice, of mercy, and of piety, I have done
them in obedience to the Word, a man can never have comfort of any good thing
that is in him. If either the authority of the Magistrate only, or the example
of thy neighbors, or the respect thou have to thine own praise, and profit,
or the inclination of thine own mind, thy own good meaning, has drawn thee
to it, if the Word have not brought thee to it, thou shall never have comfort
of it.

The second rule this Doctrine affoords us for the trial of our selves,
whether we be in the state of grace, is this. That the Word (as it is the only
worker of every saving grace) so is it the only Touchstone, whereby every
saving grace may be tried, and discerned, from that which is counterfeit. Thy
faith is but a fancy, thy repentance, thy charity, thy good works are but
counterfeit, unless thou can approve them by the Word: John 3. 21. He that
is of the truth, comes to the light, that his deeds might be made manifest,
that they are wrought according to God.

We see then, how vain that confidence is, that most men have in their estate
toward God, they glory in some good things that are in them, in a kind of
devotion toward God; and care of an honest life toward men, and yet none of all
this has been wrought by the Word, or proceeds from any conscience or
obedience unto it. They think they have faith, repentance, and other saving
graces, but they cannot approve them by this Touchstone of Gods Word.

The third Use of this Doctrine is for such as though they hear, and read Use
3.
the Word, can find in it no such light, power, or comfort as we have heard
of. 1. Either thou have not sought it aright, not with earnestness, or not
with a good heart. 2. If thou have, and do not at first find it, yet shall
thou hereafter, if thou seek it here with an honest heart, John 13. 7. What I
do thou know not now, but thou shall know hereafter. And 12. 16. These
things understood not his Disciples at the first; but when Jesus was glorified,
then remembered they that those things were written of him: and that they had
done these things unto him. 3. If the Word cannot save, inlighten, convert, and
comfort thee, nothing shall be able to do it: John 8. 47. You therefore hear
not (that is not with understanding, and love, with faith, and feeling, with
profit, and fruit) because you are not of God.

Lecture the eight and thirtieth, January 9. 1609.
IT remains now, that we come to the second point that I told you was to be
observed in these words, namely: how this salvation is said to be of the
Jews. Now when our Savior says here salvation is of the Jews, his meaning
is: that the Word of God, the means of man's salvation was to be received from
the Jews. So that the Doctrine we are hence to learn, is this: That

All the nations of the world have ever received the Word, and true Religion of
God from the Jews. Doct. 7.


In this respect, the Catholic Church, and whole company of Gods Elect are
called the house of Jacob; and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Zach. 12. 10. The
celestial Jerusalem, Heb. 12. 22. The Israel of God, Gal. 6. 16. The
Commonwealth of Israel, Ephesians. 2. 12. And Jerusalem is called the mother of us
all, Gal. 4. 26.

This honor and prerogative that God vouchsafed to the Jews, will the better
appear if we consider it in these three degrees. 1. In the state that the
Church was in before Christ's coming. 2. In the state that the Church was in
after Christ's coming. 3. In the state that the Church shall be in before the
end of the world, and second coming of Christ.

1. Before Christ's coming in the flesh, the Jews were the only Church: and
all that professed the true Religion of God, received it from them, and joined
themselves unto them. In this respect, God calls Israel his first borne, Exodus
4. 22. To them pertained the giving of the law, and the service of God, Romans 9.
4. All the Scripture of the Old Testament was written in their language, and
committed to them, Romans 3. 2. In which respect our Savior also calls all the
Scriptures of the Old Testament (not the ceremonial and judicial laws only)
their Law, John 10. 34. and 15. 25. (both which places are cited out of the
Psalms) at that time none could worship God aright; unless he joined himself
to the Jews, and became a member of that Church. So the Holy Ghost when he
would declare that many of the Persians when they saw the success God gave his
people against Haman, were converted and embraced the true Religion: he says,
Ester 8. 17. Many of the people of the land became Jews.

2. After Christ's coming in the flesh. 1. The Gospel was first sent to them:
therefore are they called the children of the Kingdom, Matthew. 8. 12. John
Baptist was sent only to them, Luke 1. 16. Our Savior himself was sent to
them, and exercised his Ministry only amongst them: and therefore is called a
Minister of the circumcision, Romans 15. 8. And he says, Matthew. 15. 24. He was
not sent to any, but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. The Apostles
before Christ's Ascension were forbidden to preach to any but to them, Matthew.
10. 5. And after Christ's Ascension were charged to preach first to them, Luke
24. 47. beginning at Jerusalem. All the Apostles did exercise their Ministry at
Jerusalem, Romans 15. 19. And made their abode there more then in any other
place, Acts 8. 1. 14. And it is expressly said, Acts 11. 19. That they which
were scattered abroad upon the persecution, which rose about Stephen, traveled
as far as Phenice and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the Word to none but
unto the Jews only. Yea Paul and Barnabas, though they went unto the Heathen,
Gal. 2. 9. yet in every place where they came, they first offered their
Ministry, and preached unto them, Acts 13. 5. and 14. 1. and 17. 1, 2, 17. and
18. 4. And if they had not rejected it, it had never been preached to the
Gentiles, Acts 13. 46. It was necessary that the Word of God should first have
been spoken to you, but seeing ye put it from you: lo we turn to the
Gentiles, Romans 11. 11. Through their fall, salvation comes to the Gentiles:
and verse 28. Concerning the Gospel they are enemies for your sake. The poor,
the maimed, the halt and the blind, had never been admitted to the feast: if
the guests that were first bidden, and for whom the feast was prepared, had not
refused to come, Luke 14. 21. 2. As the Gospel was first offered to them: so
(though many of them rejected it) yet they were the first that embraced it. The
first Church that ever received the Gospel, the Doctrine, the Sacraments, the
discipline of the New Testament, was the Church of the Jews, it is the power
of God unto salvation to every one that believes, to the Jew first, Romans 1.
16. yea you shall not find any one place, where the Apostles preached with so
great success, and increase of the Church as they did at Jerusalem, and among
the Jews, Acts 2. 41. 44. 3. All the Churches of the Gentiles conformed
themselves unto the Church of the Jews; and esteemed the Church at Jerusalem
as the mother Church, and gave special honor and respect unto it. To the
Church at Jerusalem, as to the mother Church and chief Church in all the
world, other Churches were wont to resort for their direction, and for the
deciding of such controversies as did arise amongst them, Acts 15. 2. So when
Agabus had signified to the Church at Antioch, what a dearth would come upon
the whole world, Acts 11. 28. The Disciples determined to send relief to the
brethren in Judea, verse 29. Why to them rather then to any other? Surely,
because of the chief respect they knew was due to that Church above all
others. See the like care in the brethren of Macedonia, and Achaia, Romans 15.
26. And mark the reason that is given, verse 27. Their debtors they are. Why
so? because they received the Word, and worship of God from them. 4. Yea all
the Churches of the Gentiles received the Gospel from the Church of Jerusalem,
and were derived from that Church. For even as the Lord had foretold by his
Prophets, Psalm. 110. 2. The Lord shall send the rod of thy power out of Zion.
And Esaias 2. 3. The Law shall go from Zion, and the word of the Lord from
Jerusalem: so was it fulfilled. For as the Apostles that converted the Gentiles
were all Jews: so in Jerusalem they received the gift of the Holy Ghost,
whereby they were fitted to instruct the Gentiles, Acts 1. 4. And it is
expressly noted, that from Jerusalem they all went that first carried the light
of the Gospel to the Gentiles, Acts 8. 4, 5. and 11. 19, 20. 5. All the
Gentiles that believed, joined themselves to the Church of the Jews, and
became members of it. Thus it was prophesied that they should do by Noah,
Iapheth should dwell in the tents of Sem, Gen 9. 27. And by Ezekiel, Ezekiel. 16.
61. Thou shall receive thy sisters (Sodom and Samaria under which two are
comprehended all the Gentiles) thine elder and thy younger; and I will give
them to thee for daughters. And by Zacharia, Ten men shall take hold out of all
languagues of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a
Jew, saying, We will go with you; for we have heard that God is with you,
Zach. 8. 23. This Paul says was fulfilled, Romans 11. 17. Thou being a wild
Olive, art grafted in amongst them, and verse 24. Thou art contrary to nature
grafted into a good Olive tree.

3. Before the second coming of Christ, the Jews shall be converted, and
become a most famous Church again: and they shall be the means of the
salvation of all the Elect, that shall remain to be converted among the
Gentiles. This Doctrine the Apostle plainly teaches, Romans 11. 25, 26. I would
not brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, that blindness in
part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in,
and so all Israel shall be saved, etc. 1. Obstinacy is in part come upon Israel
(not a total nor final obstinacy.) 2. Till the fulness of the Gentiles be
come in. 3. And so all Israel shall be saved. 4. He calls this a mystery;
because no man can conceive how it should be. 5. He would not have the Gentiles
ignorant of it.

And when once they shall thus have received the Gospel again, then shall
salvation again be derived from them unto the Gentiles: they shall be a means
of the converting such of the Gentiles as shall remain to be converted; and
such as were before converted, they shall draw to greater purity and zeal then
ever they had before. This the Apostle teaches, if the fall of them be the
riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles:
how much more their fullness? If the casting away of them, be the reconciling
of the world: what shall the reconciling of them be, but life from the dead?
Romans 11. 12, 15. This is that which is foretold; Esaias 60. 3. The Gentiles shall
walk in thy light: and Kings at the brightness of thy rising up, and verse 5.
The forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee. And the Apostle John speaking
of this new Jerusalem, says, Apoc. 21. 24. The people that are saved shall
walk in the light of it, and the Kings of the earth shall bring their glory
and honor unto it.

You see then this Doctrine confirmed unto you, that in all these three
several ages (as it were) and conditions of the Church, salvation has
heretofore, and shall hereafter ever come from the Jews: and from them it has
been, and shall be derived unto the Gentiles.

Now the reason why God vouchsafes this honor to that Nation, is to be
considered: and surely (if we consider well of the matter) we may wonder at it.

For 1. Never was there any Nation upon earth more unworthy of this honor then
the Jews, never any that did more provoke God, specially since the coming of
Christ in the flesh, They both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own Prophets,
and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men;
Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles, that they might be saved, to fill up
their sins always: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost, 1 Thessalonians.
2. 15, 16. 2. Never was there any Nation so unlikely to receive the Gospel as
they, Romans 11. 8. God has given them the spirit of slumber, etc. unto this
day. No people under heaven do bear so bitter hatred to Christ and the
Gospel as they do; daily in their Synagogues they blaspheme and curse Christ.
3. Never was there any Nation so unlikely that God should show this mercy unto
as the Jews. For what people ever did bear so evident marks of Gods wrath
and indignation as they have done? What people was ever so like to be a people
that God has hated and accursed, and rejected as they? Which makes the Apostle
to say, 1 Thessalonians 2. 16. Wrath is come upon them to the uttermost. These things
considered, we may wonder, that the Lord should ever vouchsafe them that
honor, as to make them his stewards, to put them in trust with the keeping of
all his treasure, and with the dispensing of it to his whole family; but
specially we may wonder that ever the Lord should now show them that mercy
again to become his people. No marvel though the Apostle calls this a
mystery, Romans 11. 25. Well; has the Lord revealed to us any reason of this,
why he should thus far forth honor this nation? yes surely.

1. They have thus rejected the Gospel, not of mere malice, but ignorantly
Reason.
out of a blind zeal, And now brethren, I wo^e that through ignorance ye did
it as did also your fathers, Acts 3. 17. In persecuting the faithful they
thought they did God service, John 16. 2. They had in them the zeal of God
even then, Romans 10. 2.

2. The purity and life of Religion which they shall discern in the Gentiles,
shall be a means to draw them; as the Idolatry, and other sins of Christians
has been the means to harden them thus long, Salvation is come unto the
Gentiles; for to provoke them to jealousy; that through your mercy, they also
may obtain mercy, Romans 11. 11. 31.

But thirdly, the chief Reason is that ancient and unchangeable love, which
God did bear to their fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: and the Covenant he
had made with them: With Abraham the Lord had made this everlasting Covenant,
Genesis 17. 7. and 22. 18. In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be
blessed. This Covenant made with their fathers is often alleged for the reason
why God showed such mercy unto this Nation, I will remember my Covenant with
Jacob, and also my Covenant with Isaac, and also my Covenant with Abraham will
I remember, and will remember the land, Leuit. 26. 42. And Ezekiel. 16. 60.
Nevertheless I will remember my Covenant with thee in the days of thy youth,
and I will establish unto thee an ever lasting Covenant. And this is alleged
by the Apostle for the only reason why they were trusted with Gods Oracles,
Romans 3. 3. What if some of them did not believe? shall their unbelief make the
faith of God without effect? And why (notwithstanding the fearful Apostacy
wherein now they lie) God will show mercy to them again, and make them his
people, Romans 11. 16. If the first fruits be holy, so is the whole lump: if the
root be holy, so are the branches.

The Use of this Doctrine is. 1. To convince the Religion of the Papists. Who
though they do apishly and superstitiously imitate the Jews in those Use 1.
things, which God has forbidden them to imitate them in (for all their
pompeous service and ceremonies are used in imitation of the Jews: and it is
evident that God has long since abrogated that ceremonial worship, Ioh. 4.
21. 23. the hour comes when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at
Jerusalem, worship the Father. But the true worshippers shall worship the
Father in spirit and in truth: yea he has condemned the use of it. Behold I
Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing,
Gal. 5. 2.) yet do they deny that honor to the Church of the Jews, which our
Savior here has given unto it.

For 1. They receive sundry books for the Old Testament, which the Church of
the Jews never acknowledged. Whereas all the Scripture of the Old Testament is
called their Law: all the Oracles of the everliving and just God, in the Old
Testament were committed to them, and they faithfully kept them to Christ's time
(or else Christ or the Apostles would have taxed them for this rather then for
any other corruptions) yea to this very day they do keep them truly and
faithfully, insomuch as (though their Rabines have given very many false and
blasphemous interpretations and glosses) yet they cannot be charged in any of
their writings to have corrupted the Text, by adding one word or letter unto
it, or by taking or diminishing one word or letter from it.

2. They hold Rome to be the mother Church unto all the world, to which all
other Churches are to conform themselves, and from which they are to receive
direction: whereas we have heard that honor belongs only to the Church of
Jerusalem.

3. They have very many things in their Religion which they hold for matters of
salvation (their whole Hierarchy, and many Doctrines also that they teach)
which never came from the Church of the Jews. Whereas it is very evident and
certain, that though they can pretend never so great antiquity for any thing
they hold, if they cannot prove it was taught and received in the Church of the
Jews, it cannot be of God.

To teach us how to stand affected to the people, and Nation of the Jews,

1. We should observe and wonder at the fearful judgment of God upon Use 2.
that Nation not only in that slavery, bondage, and contempt they have lived
in for these sixteen hundredth years, but specially in that strange obstinacy
and hardness of heart that has been thus long upon them. For if God have
thus dealt with that people for their sin, and contempt of his Gospel, which
of all people in the world he loved best, and had most obliged himself unto:
how can we hope to escape if we sin as they have done? This use the Apostle
makes, Romans 11. 21. if God spared not the natural branches, take heed least he
also spare not thee.

2. We should observe and wonder at the truth and mercy of God, who for his
promise sake has so strangely preserved that Nation and people all this while:
insomuch as they remain at this day an exceeding great people.

3. We may not hate their name and Nation, but love them, and pray for them,
and use all means to further their conversion. Sundry forcible Reasons there
be to move us unto this.

1. The affection that Gods good and godly servants, yea Christ himself did
bear unto this people: not withstanding their sin and obstinacy. See Paul's
affection to them, his hearts desire and prayer to God for Israel was, that
they might be saved. Romans 10. 1. and 9. 2, 3. he had great heaviness and
continual sorrow in his heart, and could have wished that himself bad been
accursed from Christ, for restoring of them into Gods favor. See what
affection Christ did bear unto them, Luke 19. 41, 42. he wept and expressed
exceeding compassion toward Jerusalem.

2. For their Ancestors sakes, the most honorable Nation under heaven they
have been, Christ himself was a Jew. No nation is able to derive their
pedigree, nor bring so Authentical Records for it as they. See how Paul (even
before the Corinthians that were Gentiles) glories in this, 2. Cor. 11. 22.
Are they Hebrews? so am I: are they Israelites? so am I: are they the seed of
Abraham? so am I: This reason the Apostle gives for the affection he bare to
them, Romans 9. 5. For if such respect was had to Iezabel, because she was a
Kings daughter, though otherwise she had been a wicked woman, 2. King. 9.
verse 34. How much more respect deserves this Nation even for this?

3. The promise we have heard God has made unto that Nation, that he will call
them, and make them his people again, should provoke us to pray for them, See
the force of this reason, 2, Sam. 7. 27. For thou, O Lord of hosts, God of
Israel, have revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house:
therefore has thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.

4. The glory that shall redound to God by their conversion: For then shall he
be more purely worshipped then he is hitherto by all his Elect throughout the
world.

5. The good that we our selves have received from them. For they before the
time of our calling prayed for us, and earnestly desired our conversion, as
appears, We have a little sister, and she has no breasts: what shall we do
for our sister, in the day when she shall be spoken for? Cant. 8. 8. and by
sundry Psalms, Psalm. 87. And from them we received the Gospel, and worship of
God: in which respect also we may be called their debtors, as Romans 15. 27.

To comfort such as have at any time had good evidence of Gods love to them in
Christ. For such may by this example be assured, that though they Use 3.
have justly deserved he should cast them off: and though (through the tokens
of Gods anger that are upon them, either inwardly or outwardly, their own
reason and sense may persuade them he has cast them off indeed; yet) whom he
has once loved in Christ, and received into his covenant, and called
effectually to be his people, and given his Spirit unto; them he will love to
the end, and can never cast them off, Ier. 31. 3. I have loved thee with an
everlasting love: therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee. And John
13. 1. whom Christ loves, he loves to the end. And Romans 11. 29. the gifts and
calling of God are without repentance. Let us therefore give all diligence to
make our calling and election sure: and seek good evidence to our selves that
God loves us in Christ, 2. Pet. 1. 10. There is no certainety in the love of
any mortal creature, which yet thou so much dotest upon, but the love of God
is certain and unchangeable.

For the comfort of Christian parents. Many are the privileges which the Use 4.
Lord has vouchsafed unto our children; but this is the chief, that if we
know our selves to be the children of God, we may be assured that some of our
posterity shall be so likewise.

So that this may quiet and secure our hearts (though we have many children,
and little to leave them) not only in the whole course of our lives, but even
in the hour of death. If 1. We have good assurance that ourselves are within
Gods Covenant. 2. That we have done our endeavor to bring up our children in
Gods fear, and to make them his children.

THE NINE AND THIRTIETH LECTVRE, ON IANVARY, XXIII. MDCIX.
IOH. IIII. XXIII, XXIIII. But the hour comes, and now is, when the true
worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father
seeks such to worship him.

God is a Spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit, and in
truth.


WE have already heard, that the answer our Savior makes to the question
which the woman of Samaria moved unto him, consists of two parts. 1. A
commendation of that outward worship the Jews used in comparison of that of
the Samaritans. 2. A discommendation of that outward worship of God which the
Jews used in comparison of that which God would shortly establish in his
Church. The former part of this answer is set down in the 22. verse, which we
finished the last day. The latter part of his answer is contained in these
words which I have now read unto you. The sum and effect of this part of his
answer is this.

That though the worship which the Jews then did to God, were far better
then that of the Samaritans; yet this ceremonial worship which the Jews used
(though it were commanded of God himself) was not so much to be esteemed as
she conceived, but should shortly be abolished, and in stead thereof another
form of Gods worship should be established, which should not consist in
ceremonies and shadows which suited best man's carnal and corrupt nature: but
should be spiritual as best agreeing to the nature of God, and have in it the
truth and substance of all that which was figured and shadowed in those
ceremonies.

The parts of this Text are two. 1. A proposition or Doctrine concerning the
true worship that Christians are to give unto God. Now, the true worshippers
shall worship the father in spirit, and in truth; which is repeated with some
increase, they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.

2. The Reasons of this doctrine and Proposition, and they are two. 1. Because
the Father even seeks or desires to have such worshippers. 2. Because God is
a Spirit; and must therefore have such worship and service done unto him, as is
suitable to his nature.

The Proposition or Doctrine is enlarged, or set forth by two circumstances. 1.
The Person to whom this spiritual worship is to be given: the Father. 2. The
time when this spiritual worship shall be given unto him: the hour comes,
and now is.

First then it is here to be observed: that our Savior speaking of the
worship that Christians should give unto God (which should be far better then
that which the Jews then used) calls God to whom this worship was to be done:
the Father, and that so often, even three several times, once verse 21. and
twice in this verse: What should be the reason of this? Surely our Savior
does hereby intimate one chief cause why the Christians under the Gospel
should do God better service then the Jews had done under the Law, because
they shall conceive of God as of their Father. True it is, the Lord was a
Father to his people under the Law, and so they conceived of him: but the Lord
has revealed his fatherly affection, and love in Christ more fully and
clearly to us, then he had done to his Church under the Law, Gal. 4. 3. 4, 5.
We, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world; But
when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son made of a
woman made under the Law, To redeem them that were under the Law, that we
might receive the adoption of sons.

From hence then we have this Doctrine to learn: That

No man can worship God aright till he know God to be his Father: Doct. 1.
the better a man is persuaded and assured of Gods fatherly love to him in
Christ, the better service he shall do unto him. Therefore our Savior
teaching us to pray, bids us say, Our Father, Matthew. 6. 9. As if he should say,
presume not to ask any petition of God, till thou can so conceive, and be
persuaded of him. And the Apostle tells us it is the spirit of adoption that
makes us able to pray: and makes this the voice of the spirit of prayer, it
cries, Abba, O Father, Romans 8. 15. Yea he makes it an impossible thing for any
man to pray aright without this assurance, Romans 10. 14 How shall they call on
him in whom they have not believed.

The reason of it is first, because till we know God is our Father, and Ioueth
us Reas. 1.
in Christ, we cannot be assured that he will accept us. When we know, he is
our Father in Christ, it makes us go to him with boldness and confidence, in
Christ we have boldness and access with confidence through faith in him, Ephesians.
3. 12. I will arise and go to my father (says the Prodigal, Luke 15. 18.) and
will say unto him, father I have sinned against heaven and before thee: Though
he had sinned so outragiously, yet the consideration of this that it was his
father he was to go unto, gave him boldness. It gives us assurance, that not
withstanding our infirmities he will accept us, I will spare him (and deal
gently and indulgently with him says the Lord, Mal. 3. 17.) as a man spares
his son that serves him. When the Prodigal was yet a great way off, his
father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed
him, Luke 15. 20. And nothing graceth our prayers more with God then this
confidence and boldness, Let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may
obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need, says the Apostle,
Heb. 4. 16. But without this faith and persuasion that God is our Father, we
can have no assurance that any thing we do in his service pleases him,
without faith it is impossible to please God, Heb. 11. 6. And the best thing we
do in his service without this assurance that we please him in so doing is
sin, Romans 14. 23. Whatsoever is not of faith is sin.

Secondly, because till a man be per^waded of Gods love and fatherly affection
toward him in Christ, he can never serve him of love, nor with a Reas. 2.
good heart, but upon some by-respects, upon a servile fear, or hope of merit,
Heb. 10. 22. We can never draw near to God with a true heart, till we have
assurance of faith, and our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience. No man
can truly love God till he be persuaded by the spirit, of Gods love to him,
We love God, because he loved us first, 1. John 4. 19. true love comes from a
pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned, 1. Tim. 1. 5. And
whatsoever service we do to God, unless it proceed out of a good heart, and
from love to God, it cannot please him, though a man should give his body to be
burned in Martyrdom, yet if that proceed not from his love to God, it would
profit him nothing, 1. Corinthians 13. 3. For what man would accept of any
service from him that he knows loves him not.

The Use of the Doctrine is to exhort us to get good assurance to our hearts
that God is our Father, that he bears a fatherly affection Use.
to us: above all sins strive against infidelity, Examine your selves whither
ye be in the faith, prove your selves, 2. Cor. 13. 5. Many want this
assurance, and seek it not; many seem to have it, and have it not. I will
give you four notes to try it by.

1. God is a Father to no man, but in and through Christ, John 1. 12. So many
as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to
them that believe in his name, Galathians 4. 5. He has redeemed us that were
under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of sons: so that unless a
man ground his assurance and confidence, that God is his Father, only upon
Christ: if he ground it upon this that God has made him, and preserved him,
etc. his assurance is in vain.

2. He that is persuaded indeed, that God is his Father, will ^adly and boldly
resort to him in prayer, Because ye are sons, God has sent forth the spirit
of his Son into your hearts, crying Abba Father, Gal. 4. 6. They that seldom
pray, or pray with no willingness and cheerfulness, or pray with no
confidence, doubtless are not persuaded that God is their father.

3. He that is persuaded that God is his Father, will not murmr against, nor
be put out of heart by any of Gods corrections, but be persuaded of his love
even in affliction, according to that of the Apostle, Heb. 12. 7. 9. If ye
endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons: for what son is he
whom the father chasteneth not? And Romans 15. 3. Being justified by faith we
glory even in tribulation. They that in the time of their peace and prosperity
only are confident in Gods love, but have no heart, no comfort in affliction,
are not indeed persuaded that God is their, Father.

4. He that is indeed persuaded that the Lord bears the affection of a Father
unto him, will bear the affection of a child unto God; will love him, and be
careful to please him, fearful to offend him, Mal. 1. 6. If I be your
Father where is mine honor? Heb. 10. 22. No drawing near to God in assurance
of faith, till we be sprinkled in our hearts from an evil conscience, and
washed in our bodies also. They that have no care to please God, nor fear to
offend him, doubtless are not persuaded that God is their Father.

Now come we to the principal Doctrine which our Savior teaches us in this
place, namely,

That the only true worship of God, the only worship that pleases Doct. 2.
God (now especially under the Gospel) is that which is spiritual: the
worship that is proper to the Gospel, the true Christian worship is
spiritual: For so says our Savior here, The hour comes, and now it is,
that the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit, and in truth: and
again, They that worship him, must worship him thus.

Now for the right understanding of this Doctrine, six questions must be
moved and resolved.

1. What our Savior means here, by worshipping God in spirit. Quest. 1.


The answer is: that to worship God in spirit, is to worship him Answ.
without such ceremonies as were under the Law. This appears by this note of
diversity which our Saulour here uses: (but) as if he should say: the worship
the Jews now use (which chiefly consists in their sacrifices, oblations,
purifications, and such like ceremonies) is good, because it is done upon
knowledge of Gods will revealed in his Word: but now such as worship God
aright, shall worship him in another manner, namely not in such ceremonies, but
in spirit, and truth: So that to worship God in spirit, is opposed to the
ceremonial worship, because that was not a spiritual, but a carnal worship.
See this in that opposition Paul makes: Gal. 3. 3. Are ye so foolish? having
begun in the spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? So the ceremonial
Law is called a carnal commandment, Heb. 7. 16. and all the ceremonies are
called carnal rites, Heb. 9. 10. A strange term to be given to the worship
that God himself ordained. But the ceremonies are so called. Because 1. They
were all outward, and bodily actions. Yea, if we look over all the ceremonial
Law, we shall find nothing enjoined, either to the Priests, or people, but
external and bodily things: the service of the spirit and conscience, is
seldom or never mentioned, Heb. 9. 9, 10. The first Tabernacle was a figure
for the time then present; in which were offered both gifts, and sacrifices,
that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the
conscience, which stood only in meats, and drinks, and diverse washings, and
carnal ordinances imposed on them, until the time of reformation. Whereas the
service God requires under the Gospel, is in a manner wholly inward, and
spiritual. For thus the Lord speaks of the days of the Gospel, wherein he
will make a new Covenant with his people, Iere. 31. 34. They shall all know me
from the least of them, to the greatest of them, says the Lord. And verse ^3.
I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts. Now the
Lord still calls for the service of the spirit, and heart at our hands. Our
preaching pleases not God, unless it be the action of our spirit, Paul served
God with his spirit in the Gospel of his Son, Romans 1. 9. Our hearing pleases
him not, unless it be the action of our heart and spirit, the Holy Ghost
opened the heart of Lydia to attend, Acts 16. 14. Our prayers please not God,
unless they be the service of the heart, and spirit, pray with all prayer and
supplication in the spirit, Ephesians. 6. 18. Our singing, making melody in your
hearts to the Lord, Ephesians. 5. 19. Our communicating in the Sacrament pleases
not God, unless it be the service of our spirit, no man receives worthily
unless he examine himself before, and be able to discern the body of the
Lord in that ordinance, 1. Corinthians 11. 29.

2. They are called carnal, because they were all transitory: and to inindure
but for a time. To this reason the Apostle has respect, Heb. 7. 16. 18. When
he calls the Law of the Leuiticall Priesthood a carnal commandment, because
it was to be disanulled. Whereas our worship shall continue, and never be
altered, and in this respect the Apostle preferres the state of the Church now,
before that of the Old Testament, Heb. 1. 1, 2. that whereas the Lord delivered
his will to his Church not all at once, but at sandry times by the Prophets; he
has by his Son fully made his mind known unto us in these last days, not
at sundry times, but at once. And therefore also the Apostle Jude calls it the
faith that was once (for all) delivered unto the Saints, Jude 3. In which
respect the whole time since Christ's Ascension, is called also the end of the
world: 1. Cor. 10. 11. And the last times, 2. Tim. 3. 1. Acts 2. 17. 1. Pet. 1.
20. 1. Ioh. 2. 18.

3. Because the effect, and fruit of them reaches no further then to the body,
and outward man, they could not make holy concerning the conscience, him that
did the service, Heb. 9. 9. and 10. 1. they could not make the comers
thereunto perfect: but sanctified only as touching the purifying of the flesh,
Heb. 9. 13. Therefore they are called, Gal. 4. 9. Weak and beggarly elements.
Whereas the service of God under the Gospel, works wholly (in a manner) upon
the conscience, and inward man, the Kingdom of God (the true Religion and the
sincere profession of it) is not in word, but in power, 1. Cor. 4. 20. If the
Word be preached, and heard, the Sacraments administered, and received, prayer
used as they ought, they will work upon the conscience, not upon the outward
man only. Therefore it is called 2. Cor. 3. 8. the ministration of the Spirit.

4. It is called a carnal worship, because it is very pleasing to the
natural, and carnal man: he makes great conscience of it, and delights much
in it. In which respect also the Apostle says, Gal. 4. 3. it was a service fit
for Gods people when they were children. Our Savior observes the Pharisees to
have been very precise in the observation of the ceremonial Law, and to have
made much more conscience of it then of the moral, they paid tithe of mint,
and annise, and commin, and omitted the weightier matters of the Law,
Judgment, Mercy, and Fidelity, Matthew. 23. 23. And the Lord by his Prophet
speaking of such, as for their wickedness he calls Princes of Sodom, and
people of Gomorrah, says: they offered a multitude of Sacrifices, brought many
oblations to God and much incense, observed diligently the new Moons, and
Sabbaths, and solemn days: Esaias 1. 11. 13. Yea all heathen men, and pagans
have had their sacrifices and ceremonies: Balaam and Balak used them, Numb. 23.
1 -- 4. Whereas the service that God requires of us under the Gospel, is such
as no natural man can relish, or find any savor in. Nay, none but such as
have the spirit, can make any account of our worship, can hear, receive, pray
with conscience and delight, 1. John 4. 6. He that is of God, hears us, he
that is not of God, hears us not. So 1. Cor. 2. 14. The natural man
receives not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto
him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.

Thus we see what our Savior here means by worshipping God in spirit.

Lecture the fortieth, January 30. 1609.
WHat means he by worshipping God in truth? Quest. 2. 2.


The answer is, to worship God in truth, is to worship him Answ.
without such ceremonies, as were under the Law. This appears by that note of
diversity here used (but) which I observed before. Truth then is not here
opposed either unto a false worship, or unto hypocrisy, but unto the
ceremonial worship. So that in both these words, one, and the self same thing
is understood by our Savior: and it is as if he should have said, the true
worshippers now shall worship God without ceremonies. Yet are neither of these
words superfluous, but as spirit is opposed to the ceremonial worship, as it
was an external, and carnal worship: so truth is opposed to it as it was full
of shadows, and figures. And thus is this word (truth) taken, Dan. 7. 16. I
asked him the truth of (that is the meaning, and that that was signified by)
all this, so he told me, and made me the interpretation of the things. All the
ceremonies were shadows: Colos. 2. 7. The whole Tabernacle was a figure, Heb.
9. 9. Yea Heb. 10. 1. The Law had the shadow of good things to come: and not
the very live picture of them.

Now our Savior says, that the truth and substance of those things that were
shadowed by the ceremonial worship, shall be in our worship under the Gospel,
We shall find that the ceremonies were shadows, and figures, not only of
Christ, and of those good things we receive by him, but also of those graces,
and good things as should be in the faithful the members of Christ.

1. Circumcision was but a shadow. What was the truth, and substance of it?
Surely the circumcising, and cutting off (by true mortification) the corruption
of the heart: Romans 2. 28. That is not circumcision which is outward: as if he
should say, that was but a shadow: then verse 29. Circumcision is that of the
heart in the spirit, and not in the letter. The Jew had but the shadow of
circumcision, every true worshipper now has the truth, and substance of it.

2. The casting of leaven out of all their houses in the feast of the
Passover: Exodus 12. 15. was but a shadow. What was the truth, and substance of
it? That they that would serve God with comfort, and joy, must purge out the
old leaven of malitiousnesse, and wickedness, and keep this feast with the
unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, 1. Cor. 5. 7, 8. The Jew had but the
shadow of the Passover, every true worshipper now has the substance of it.

3. The Jews had in their worship many propitiatory sacrifices for the
obtaining of the remission of all kind of sins that they had committed
against God, Heb. 9. 22. Without shedding of blood there was no remission. And
the Law was, that whosoever brought one of these sacrifices to God, must (in
presenting it to be offered by the Priest) put his hand upon the head of it,
and lean upon it, or else it could not be accepted of the Lord for his
atonement, Leuit. 1. 4. And that when it was slain by the Priest, the blood
of it must be sprinkled upon the people, Exodus 248. Now this was but a figure
and a shadow; what was the truth and substance of it? Surely, that no man ever
shall have Christ's Sacrifice accepted of God for his atonement, unless by a
lively faith he can apply Christ unto himself, leaning and relying with
confidence of heart upon him; unless he be able to say, this is my sacrifice,
this is he that has borne my sins and my punishment, as Gal. 2. 20. He has
loved me, and given himself for me. And Esaias 53. 4. Surely he has borne our
infirmities, and carried our sorrows. The blood of Christ will do a man no
good, unless it be sprinkled and applied to his own conscience by the Spirit
of God, 1. Pet. 1. 2. The Elect are to be saved through the obedience and
sprinkling of the blood of Christ: which is therefore called the blood of
sprinkling, which speaks better things then the blood of Abel, Heb. 12. 24.

4. They had also many Eucharisticall Sacrifices, Sacrifices of thanksgiving,
which were called Peace Offerings. When they would solemnly profess their
thankfulness to God for any blessing received, they were wont to do it by
sacrifices and peace offerings: yea as the cause of their thanksgiving did
exceed: so were they wont to exceed and abound in these Sacrifices. So it is
said of the people of God after their return to Jerusalem out of their
captivity, Neh. 12. 53. The same day they offered great Sacrifices, and
rejoiced, for God had given them great joy. And of Solomon it it is said, that
at the dedication of the Temple, he offered a sacrifice of two and twenty
thousand bullocks: and an hundredth and twenty thousand sheep, 2. Chron. 7. 5.
Now this manner of serving God was but a figure and shadow. What was the truth
and substance of it? Surely the spiritual sacrifices whereby Christians are to
praise God, and show themselves thankful unto him for his mercies, were
figured and shadowed by those Sacrifices: as namely,

1. A contrite heart. When a man (out of the consideration of Gods mercy) can
unfeignedly repent and lament, that he has by his sins offended so good a
Father, this is a true Sacrifice of thanksgiving, Psalm. 51. 17. the Sacrifices
of God are a broken spirit.

2. Obedience. When a man can (in thankfulness to God for his mercies)
sacrifice himself unto God, resign himself wholly unto his obedience and
service, this is a true sacrifice of thanksgiving, Romans 11. 1, 2. I beseech
you by the mercies of God that you give up your bodies a living sacrifice,
holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable serving of God; and fashion
not your selves like unto this world, but be you changed by the renewing of
your mind.

3. Prayer. When a man can find, that the experience he has had of Gods
goodness, stirs him up to go often to God in prayer, and so to depend upon
him for all good things: this is a true sacrifice of thanksgiving, Heb. 13.
15. Let us therefore by him offer the sacrifice of praise always to God, that
is the fruit of the lips which confess his name. And Psalm. 116. When David had
said, verse 12. What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits toward
me? He resolves himself, verse 13. I will take the cup of salvation, and call
upon the name of the Lord. And Psalm. 50. When the Lord had showed to the Jews
how small pleasure he took in all their sacrifices: he sets down, verse 14,
15. What are the true sacrifices of thanksgiving which he delighted in. Offer
unto God praise, and pay thy vows to the most high, and call upon me in the
day of trouble.

4. Good works. When a man in thankfulness and love to God (for all his
mercies) does deal justly and mercifully with all men for the Lords sake: then
offers he to God a true sacrifice of thanksgiving, Heb. 13. 16. To do good,
and to distribute forget not, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. So
Paul calls the relief which the Philippians sent him when he was in prison at
Rome, An odor that smelled sweet, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasant unto
God. Phil. 4. 18. So then we see now what our Savior means, when he says,
the true worshippers shall worship God in truth. The Sacraments and sacrifices
of the Jews were but shadows and figures: the true worshippers of God under
the Gospel, shall have in them the truth and substance of that, which was
shadowed in those ceremonies. The true and substantial worship of God
consists in a lively faith, unfeigned repentance, absolute obedience to the
will of God in all things, hearty prayer, love, justice, mercifulness,
sincerity, and such like graces of Gods Spirit.

Thus have I gone through the two first questions, I propounded for the better
understanding of this Doctrine. In the four other that follow, I will be
briefer.

The third question is. What means our Savior, by the hour that comes and
now is? When should the true worshippers worship God in Spirit Quest. 3.
and in truth? When should this spiritual and substantial worship of God that
we have heard of, begin? was the ceremonial worship at an end when he spoke
this?

I answer no, For after this time, Matthew. 8. 4. Christ sends the Leper to the
Priest, and bids him offer his gift appointed in the Ceremonial Law. Answ.
And Christ himself observed the feast of unleavened bread, at which time the
Text says, Luke 22. 7. The Passover must be killed. This hour and time
began not till Christ had suffered, and was glorified, and ascended into
heaven. Presently when Christ had said in his Passion, John 19. 30. It is
finished. It is said, Matthew. 27. 51. The veil of the Temple was rent in twain
from the top to the bottom: then was the Ceremonial worship abrogated. And
when Christ ascended and was glorified, then began the time, when the true
worshippers should worship God in spirit, and in truth. This is plain, John 7.
39. This spoke he of the Spirit, which they that believed in him, should
receive, for the Holy Ghost was not yet come, because that Jesus was not yet
glorified. Now because this time of Christ's Passion and Ascension was at hand
even now, therefore our Savior says here: the hour comes, and now is.

The fourth question is. Was not God worshipped in Spirit and truth before the
time of Christ's Passion and Ascension? Did all Gods people under Quest. 4.
the Law, and such as lived in Christ's time, Simeon, Anna, Mary, Zachary, and
Elizabeth worship God only in ceremony, and shadow, not in spirit and truth?

I answer. 1. That even under the Law, the Lord was never satisfied with a
ceremonial worship, but did ever require to be worshipped in spirit Answ.
and truth. So said Samuel to Saul, 1. Sam. 15. 22. Has the Lord as great
pleasure in burnt offerings, and sacrifices, as when the voice of the Lord is
obeyed? To obey is better then sacrifice, and to hearken is better then the fat
of Rams, So Psalm. 51. 16. Thou desire no sacrifice, though I would give it,
thou delightest not in burnt offerings, Hos. 6. 6. I desired mercy, and not
sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more then burnt offerings. Mic. 6. 8. He
has showed thee O man what is good; and what does the Lord require of thee,
but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God. Mark.
12. 33. To love the Lord with all thy heart, and with all thy understanding,
and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and to love a man's neighbor
as himself is more then all burnt offerings and sacrifices. 2. The people of
God under the Law did not worship him only in ceremony, but in spirit and
truth. So David when he had said, Psalm. 40. 6. Sacrifice and offering thou do
not desire: he adds verse 8. I desired to do thy will O my God, yea thy Law is
within my heart. And the Ministry they enjoyed, was not the Ministry of the
letter only, but of the Spirit also. So it is said of the Ministry of Leui,
Mal. 2. 6. He did turn many away from iniquity.

But though this be so, yet our Savior says here, The hour comes, and now
is; as if he should have said, it has not been so before, because 1. Though
God gave his Spirit to his people then, yet not so generally then as now: but
then only to the Jews, now Acts 2. 17. In the latter days I will power out
of my Spirit upon all flesh. Nor so fully to them that did receive it as now.
The Prophet speaking of the days of Christ, says, Esaias 11. 9. The earth shall
be full of the knowledge of God as the waters that cover the sea, Zach. 12. 8.
He that is feeble among them in that day shall be as David. 2. Though the Lord
did then also require a spiritual worship, and the faithful performed it, yet
they did not serve God only in spirit and in truth, but also in ceremonies and
shadows, and so God required them to do, Leuit. 4. 3. yea, he required it of
them upon a great penalty, Exodus 5. 3. Let us go and sacrifice unto the Lord,
least he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword, yea he was much
pleased and delighted in it: and it is therefore called an oblation made by
fire for a sweet savor unto the Lord, Leuit. 1. 9. So that these words are to
be understood comparatively: as if he should say, Though the Father were
worshipped in spirit and truth before, yet in comparison of that he shall be
after my death and Ascension, he was not worshipped in spirit and truth before.
So is that place also to be understood, Heb. 9. 8. The way into the holiest of
all (into heaven) was not yet opened while the first Tabernacle was standing.
That is not so wide, not made so common, not so fully opened as afterward.

From hence arises the fifth question. Must we now under the Gospel serve God
only in spirit? Does God now require of us no other worship Quest. 5.
but that only that is spiritual?

I answer: 1. That God has appointed for us a bodily and outward worship also;
yea he has given us some significant ceremonies to use in his Answ.
worship and service: namely, both our Sacraments which are visible signs of
invisible grace. He requires not only the service of our hearts, but also the
service of our tongue and knee in calling on his name, and singing of Psalms;
the service of our ear in hearkening to his Word; the service of our eye in
beholding that that is done in the administration of the sacraments; the
service of our whole body in presenting our selves before him in the public
assemblies. So that it is but the speech of a profane Hypocrite to say thus.
Though I make not that show as others do, though I use not to kneel and say
my prayers either with my family, or apart, though I go not so much to Church
as other do; yet I serve God as well as they, I serve him in my heart, I lift
up my heart unto him, I serve him in my calling, I get my living by my earnest
labor, I deal justly with all men; and God is a Spirit, and will be
worshipped in spirit; it is the service of the heart that he looks for, he
cares not for these hypocritical shows; it is no matter though I serve him
not outwardly so long as I have a good heart.

And there be three Reasons, why men may not content themselves to serve God in
spirit only, but must do him outward and bodily service also.

1. In respect of God: for he having created, redeemed, and sanctified our
bodies as well as our souls, is of right to have homage and service done him
by both, 1. Cor. 6. 19, 20. Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a
price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, for they are
Gods.

2. In respect of our selves, for the service we do to God in our bodies, is a
great and necessary help to our spirits, Romans 10. 17. Faith comes by hearing.

3. In respect of others: for our light should so shine before men, that they
may see our good works (see that we worship and serve God) and glorify our
Father which is in heaven, Matthew. 5. 6.

Why then (may you say) how does Gods service now differ from that Object.
which was under the law: seeing the faithful then served him in spirit, and
truth as well as we: and we serve God, with an outward ceremonial worship as
well as they?

I answer, the difference stands in these two points. 1. Though we have some
outward worship, and significant ceremonies now, yet have we Answ.
nothing so much outward worship required of us, as was of them; nor so many
significant ceremonies as they had. Besides their Sabbaths and new Moons, they
had many other festival days which they were bound to observe; their Temple
and every thing in it, their sacrifices, their offerings, and purifications,
their Priests, and every thing that belonged to them, were significant
ceremonies, we have but a little outward worship in comparison required, and
but two only significant ceremonies left unto us by Christ. 2. Even that
outward worship that we have is much more plain and spiritual then theirs
was, much more effectual to work upon the understanding and conscience then
that was: our ceremonies do much more clearly set forth and represent that
which they signify, then their ceremonies did.

Did not circumcision more clearly represent the remission of our sins, and
regeneration by the merits of Christ's blood, then Baptism? Did not the Object.
slaying and eating of the Paschall Lamb more clearly represent the Passion
of Christ, and the nourishment our souls receive by it, then the Lords Supper
does?

I answer no. For they represented Christ that was to come, and take our nature
upon him, and perform therein the work of our redemption. Answ.
Ours represent Christ that is come, and has already taken our nature upon
him, and performed fully the work of our redemption. And therefore theirs were
both of them bloody Sacraments, to show and figure unto Gods people, that blood
was to be shed for the obtaining of these good things for them; ours are
without blood, to show to us, that Christ's blood is already shed for us, and
that there is no more blood to be shed for our sins. Therefore Christ
instituting the Lords Supper, calls the wine his blood that was already shed,
Matthew. 26. 28. So that as the faithful that lived in Christ's time, and saw all
that performed which God had promised concerning him; were much more confirmed
in their faith, and had much more comfort in the knowledge of Christ, then
those had that lived before, and believed in him, your father Abraham rejoiced
to see my day, and he saw it (by faith) and was glad, John 8. 58. I tell you
that many Prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which ye see,
and have not seen them, and to hear those things which ye hear, and have
not heard them, Luke 10. 24. When Simeon (who had waited for the Consolation of
Israel, that is, for Christ's coming, Luke 2. 25.) had both seen Christ and
taken him up in his arms, he was so comforted, that he desired to live no
longer, but cried, Lord now let thou thy servant depart in peace, according
to thy word, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, Luke 2. 28, 29, 30. So our
Sacraments that represent Christ as one that is already come, and has
performed the work of our redemption, must needs make much more for the
confirmation of our faith, and comfort of our conscience, then theirs did.

The sixth question follows. What was the cause of this alteration in the
Quest. 6.
worship of God, that the Lord (in whom there is no variableness nor shadow of
change, Iam. 1. 17.) would be served after one manner under the Law, and
another under the Gospel? under the Law with many ceremonies, under the
Gospel in a more spiritual manner.

I answer, that this grew not from any alteration in the Lord, but from Answ.
the change that was in the state and condition of his Church.

In appointing that ceremonies and pompous worship under the law, the Lord
respected not so much his own disposition, as the weakness of that people,
and condition of those times.

1. The Lord gave them that kind of worship to restrain them from Idolatry,
which otherwise he saw they were strongly inclined unto. Now that the Church
is of greater strength, he has appointed another manner of worship more
agreeable to his own nature, and disposition.

2. That worship was fittest for the Church in her childhood: the outward
worship is easily performed, though it have most straight conditions annexed to
it, as we may see by that question and offer that hypocrites made, Micah 6. 6,
7. Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?
Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of
rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of
my body for the sin of my soul: but the inward and spiritual worship is not
only hard, but impossible to be performed without the grace of God.

And therefore it pleased God in tender regard to the weakness of his Church
under the Law, to appoint unto them more of that outward worship, and to accept
of their spiritual service, though it were in small measure; but now to
require a greater measure of spiritual worship, and enjoin little of the
other. Of children we require a bodily service, in saying their prayers, and
graces, and Catechism: and though they have little or no vnerstanding, and
sense of that they say, yet we take it in good part.

3. Though God was able to have established his spiritual worship before, and
to have given his spirit to his Church under the Law in as great measure as
now, yet was it fit this honor should be reserved unto the coming of Christ
in the flesh: he being the Son of righteousness, it was fit that at his rising
all those mists and shadows should vanish away.

It was fit that God should honor and solemnize the marriage of his Son with
his Church, and his triumph over Satan, etc. by bestowing his gifts and graces
more abundantly upon men, then he had done before. To this the Apostle has
respect, when he says, Ephesians 4. 8. When he ascended up on high, he lead
captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.

Lecture the one and fortieth, February 13. 1609. JOHN IIII. XXIII.
We have already heard, that these II. Verses consist of a Doctrine, and of
two reasons that are used to confirm it. The Doctrine is this, that they only
worship God aright (specially now under the Gospel) as worship him not with a
ceremonious worship, but in spirit and truth. The Doctrine we finished the last
day, it remains now that we proceed to the Reasons that our Savior gives
here to prove that they that should now worship God with a ceremonious worship
(as the Jews had done hitherto) should not worship him aright, but they only
that worship him in spirit and in truth.

The 1. Reason is in these words, for the Father requires even such to worship
him, or the Father even seeks and desires such worshippers. The Reas. 1.
force of this reason stands in three points.

1. That worship only is to be given to God (not which pleases and seems
best to us) but which himself requires, and delights in. It is no better
then Idolatry, and spiritual whoredom for us to follow our own heart and
good meaning in this case, Number. 15. 39. Yea a man shall highly provoke God if
he do him any service that he requires not. Nadab and Abihu were destroyed
with fire from heaven for offering incense with fire that he had not commanded
them to use, Leuit. 10. 3. yea the care of a Christian must be, not only to
do God that service that he requires, but to do it also in that manner, as he
may please God in doing it, or else he does but loose his labor. David was
exceeding careful of this in all his prayers, Psalm. 19. 14. Let the words of
my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight. And he
professes that if God when he prayed, did not answer him (that is, give him
some comfortable assurance that he accepted, and took his prayer in good part)
it would be even a death to him, Psalm. 28. 1. Be not deaf to me, least if
thou answer me not, I be like to them that go down to the pit. And this
should be every Christians care, Heb. 12. 28. Let us have grace to serve him,
so as we may please him.

2. The Lord seeks, and desires to have such to serve him, as worship him in
spirit and in truth, he even seeks such worshippers, yea he is greatly
delighted with such a worship. A strange thing it is, that God should seek or
desire this at our hands that we should worship him: For he has no need of our
service, neither can he receive any benefit at all by any worship we do unto
him. If we pray constantly in secret, and constantly frequent the public
assemblies, the benefit is wholly our own, Pro. 9. 12. If thou be wise, thou
shall be wise for thy self: what shall the Lord gain by it? Job 37. 5. If
thou be righteous, what give thou to him, or what receives he at thy hand?
Nay, the best service we can do, is so weakly and unto wardly done, as it is
a wonder that God abhorres it not, Esaias 64. 6. All our righteousness is as
filthy clouts. Insomuch as the best of Gods servants seldom please themselves
in any service they do unto him, but see cause of shame in the very best
actions, and services they have done unto him. Nehe. 13. 2. Pardon me O my God
according to thy great mercy. Why? what had he done that he craves pardon for?
Surely, he had done an excellent piece of service unto God; he had showed a
marvelous zeal for the sanctifying of the Sabbath; but he knew that good
service of his was so imperfect, so full of stains that he had need of pardon.
And yet such is the wonderful goodness of God to them whom he loves in
Christ, such is the delight that he takes in his own graces, in the fruits of
his own spirit, that (as if he should receive some great benefit by it) he
seeks to us, and desires us to serve him, Call upon me in the day of trouble,
Psalm. 50. 15. seek, ask, knock, that is, pray earnestly and importunately,
Matthew. 7 7 pray without ceasing, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 17. ye he professes that he
takes marvelous delight in our poor services we do unto him. This is plainly
proved by that speech the Lord uses to his Church, which is the company of
all the faithful, Cant. 2. 14. My dove that art in the holes of the rock in
the secret places of the stairs, (that is, whose state is most stable and
sure, and against whom the gates of hell shall never be able to prevail) show
me thy sight (let me see thee often, come often unto me) let me hear thy voice
(pray often to me) And mark the reason why he sues thus to his Church: For thy
voice is sweet, and thy sight comely (As if he should say, howsoever thou
think of thy self, whatsoever thou iudgest of thine own prayers, I assure
thee, that in my ear there is no music to that, in mine eye there is no
person in the world so well favored as thou art.) That even as the affection
that is in us that are parents, toward our little children when they begin to
speak, makes us delight to hear them prattle: (though to another that has
not that affection it be very troublesome) and though in another eye they
seem hard favored, yet this fatherly affection makes us think them to be
very pretty and well favored children: so is it with the Lord our God: the
fatherly affection he bears to us in Christ, makes him desirous to have us
come often to him, to pray and worship him often, and to delight so much in our
poor prayers, though in themselves they be not worthy to be delighted in: The
Father seeks such worshippers, Apoc. 5 8. The hearts of all the faithful are
compared to golden Viols full of odors. What were those odors? The prayers of
the Saints, of these true worshippers that worship in spirit and truth. Why are
the prayers of the godly called odors? 1. In respect of the godly themselves,
because for the most part they yield a sweet savor, and unspeakable comfort
unto their own hearts, John 16. 24. Ask that your joy may be full. But 2.
Chiefly in respect of the Lord (for the faithful themselves sometimes feel no
sweetness in their prayers) but to the Lord their prayers are even as the
sweetest odors: even such prayers as themselves feel small sweetness, or
delight in, are most pleasant and delightsome to the Lord. Hezechia felt small
sweetness in that prayer he made, when in his sickness he turned his face to
the wall, and wept sore, when his heart was so oppressed with grief that he
could not speak, but in his prayer chattered like a swallow, and mourned like
a dove, Esaias 38. 14. But the Lord took great complacencie and delight in it,
as may appear by the reward he gave him for it presently; for before the
Prophet Esaias (whose message from the Lord you know had been the occasion of
that good Kings heaviness) was gone out into the middle of the Court, the Lord
bad him turn again with a quite contrary message, and tell Hezechia, that he
had heard his prayer (even that uncomfortable prayer) and seen his tears and
healed him; so as within three days he should be able to go up into the house
of the Lord, yea that he would also add unto his days 15. years, 2. King.
20. 4, 5. David felt small sweetness in the prayer he made at that time, when
he said in his have, he was but a castaway; but even that prayer was a sweet
odor unto God, as appears by the comfortable answer he received from God,
even at that time, Psalm. 31. 2^. Though I said in my have I am cast out of thy
sight, yet thou heardest the voice of my prayer when I cried unto thee.

Will God so far forth respect the prayers that his poor servants make unto
him in spirit and in truth, even when their hearts are so oppressed with
grief, that they cannot pray with any cherfulness; yea then, when (in
affliction of mind) they have so far forth yielded to their infidelity, as
that they doubt they are no better then Hypocrites, and Reprobates, that he
desires even then such prayers, he would have them even when they are in that
case to pray to him, yea he delights and takes pleasure even in such prayers.
Then is this most true, which our Savior here teaches us, that the Father
even seeks and desires such worshippers as can worship him in spirit and in
truth, though they do it weakly and imperfectly.

3. Yet will the force of this reason the better appear if we consider the
third point. Viz. How the Lord stands affected to that worship which hypocrites
do unto him, that worship him only in ceremony, not in spirit and in truth.

1. He regards not such service men do to him, nor takes any pleasure in it,
Esaias (...). What have I to do with the multitude of your sacrifices? (as if he
should say) what care I for them? Genesis 4 5. Unto Cain and to his offering the
Lord had no respect. No not when they pray to him with most devotion and
earnestness, as in their extreme affliction, yet the Lord regards it not, no
more then you regard the roaring of the Bear, or Bull when they are baited.
This the Hypocrites complain of, Wherefore have we fasted and thou see not?
Wherefore have we afflicted our soul and thou take no knowledge? Esaias 58.
3. And thus the Lord threatens, Pro. 1. 26, 27. 28. I also will laugh at your
calamity, I will mock when your fear comes, when your fear comes as
desolation, and your destruction comes as a whirlwind, when distress and
anguish comes upon you; then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer,
they shall seek me early but they shall not find me. Though such a man do
the very same service unto God, that the Lord has in his Word commanded;
though he say good prayers, hear the Word sincerely taught, receive the
Sacraments sincerely administered, he does but loose his labor, he has done a
thankelesse office, because God desires no such matter at their hands, Psalm.
50. 16. Unto the wicked God says, What cause have thou to do to declare my
statutes, or that thou should take my Covenant in thy mouth? As if he should
say, What have thou to do to serve God. Therefore it is added in that place of
Esaias 1. 12. Who required this at your hands to tread in my Courts? As if he
should say, fitter for you to be in your shops, or in the alehouse, or any
where else then here, Psalm. 118. 20. This is the gate of the Lord, the
righteous shall enter into it. Many others come in, that are not righteous, nor
have so much as a desire to be godly, or purpose to leave their sins, but
hate them that are godly with all their hearts; but alas the Lord takes no
pleasure to see such here, but asks them, who gave them authority to come
hither? It is not so dangerous a presumption (I assure you) for a Rogue that
has the plague running on him to press into the Kings privy Chamber, and
there to offer to wait at his Table, as for the drunkard, and whoremonger, and
swearer, and hater of godliness, to come into Gods House, or to take upon him
to do God any service. Mark how the Lord casts this in the teeth of ungodly
men, Ier. 7. 9, 10, 11. Will you steal and commit adultery, and swear, and
come and stand before me in this house, whereupon my name is called, Is this
house become a den of thieves (or a receptacle for whores and adulterers, for
swearers and drunkards) behold even I see it, says the Lord.

2. He desires not their service, but reiects it, Esaias 1. 11. I desire not the
blood of bullocks, nor of lambs, nor of goats? No, Did not the Lord himself
require and command these sacrifices? yes to his people the true worshippers he
did; but not to the hypocrite and wicked man.

3. He abhorres the best service they can do to him, and detests them, even
for praying to him, and taking upon them to do him service, Esaias 1. 13.
Incense is an abomination to me I cannot suffer your new Moons, nor Sabbaths,
my soul hates your new Moons, they are a burden to me, I am weary to bear
them. It is a thing the Lord abhorres, and hates to see a wicked man use
prayer, frequent the Church Assemblies. A strange and fearful, yet a most
true saying, mark upon what warrant I speak it, Pro. 21. 27. The sacrifice of
the wicked is an abomination, how much more when he brings it with a wicked
heart? As if he should say, Though he do not mean ill in it, but have a good
meaning in it to serve God, yet is it an abomination to the Lord.

If any shall say this is strange Doctrine, if we be never so bad, would Object.
you not have us come to Church, would you not have us pray, and serve God?
Many a bad man has received much good by coming to Church.

I answer, 1. God indeed has commanded all men to serve him, the Moral Law
was given to Adam and all his posterity, wicked men shall Answ.
be damned, because they have not used to pray and hear his Word, yea, it
shall be easier in the day of judgment for that wicked man that has used to
serve God, then for him that is utterly irreligious and profane. Therefore the
Lord condemns the very Atheist because he did not pray, Psalm. 14. 4.

2. The wicked by the service he does to God, does often obtain freedom from
temporal judgments that otherwise would fall upon him, and gets temporal
rewards, 1. King. 21. 29. Ahab did so.

3. Many a wicked man by coming into Gods House, (yea even when he has come
with a wicked intent) has been effectually called, as the unbeliever that
Paul speaks of, 1. Cor. 14. 25, 26. And those messengers that were sent to
apprehend Christ, John 7. 46. In which three respects, it may be thought good
policy for the wicked man to pray, and hear, and serve God.

4. No sin that any man has lived in, in former time, can make his prayers
or service ever a whit the less acceptable to God, if he do now repent, the
Publican upon his unfeigned humiliation and repentance went home justified, Luke
18. 13, 14. So that this Doctrine tends not to the terror, and discomfite of
any the most notorious sinner that is penitent; but to the impenitent sinner,
to the man that continues in sin, it is indeed a fearful doctrine (and if
it be not fearful now being uttered by a weak man, yet it will certainly be
fearful to thee when the Lord shall charge it upon thy conscience) God
regards not any service thou do to him, nay he would not have thee to do
him any service, nay he abhorres whatsoever service comes from thee.

Lecture the two and fortieth, February 20. 1609.
ANd thus have I finished the first Reason, that our Savior here brings for
the confirmation of this Doctrine: his second Reason is this. God is a Spirit.
Now in this second Reason we must consider, first the meaning of Reas. 2.
the words, then the force they have to conclude that for which Christ
alleges them.

First then we must not take these words as a perfect definition of the nature
of God. For that that is here spoken of God, agrees also to the Angels, and to
the soul of man The Angels are spirits, Psalm. 104. 4. He makes the (...) his
messengers, and Heb. (...). 14. Are they not all ministering spirits. The soul
of man also is a spirit, Eccles, 12. 7. The spirit shall return to God who
gave it, A^s 7. 59. Lord Jesus receive my spirit. But because of all the
creatures God has made, these do most fully and lively resemble the divine
nature, it has pleased the Lord (having respect therein to the weakness and
shallowness of our capacity) to call himself a Spirit both here, and in other
places of the holy Scripture, 2. Cor. 3. 17. The Lord is a Spirit, Heb. 9. 14
Christ's Godhead is called the eternal Spirit. 1. As they are immortal, so
the Lord is immortal, yea he only has immortality (1. Tim. 6. 16.) of
himself. 2. As they are wise and understanding natures, so the Lord is of
himself infinite in wisdom. In which respect he is called God only wise, 1.
Tim. 1. 17. 3. As they are simple, invisible, incorporeall, not having (...)
mixture, nor consisting of any corporal substance. And therefore (...) ^oues
himself after his Resurrection, not to be a spirit by this reason, (...) (...)
Behold my hands and my feet, handle me, and see, for a spirit (...) (...) ^d
bones as ye see me have, so is the Lord: and in this respect principally is
the Lord called a Spirit in this place, because he is not a visible, sensible,
corporal, but a spiritual nature.

Now for the force that is in this reason to conclude that for which Christ
brings it: the true worshippers must worship the Father in spirit and truth,
not with a ceremonial and outward worship, because God is a Spirit. The force
(I say) of this reason is evident. His worship must be answerable to his own
nature. Such as himself is, such must the worshippers be that he delights
in. According to the Proverb, like will have like; like master, like man. Such
as a man's own disposition is, such he desires they should be that serve him.
David had no better an argument to prove that he did unfeignedly fear God then
this, that all his delight was in godly men, Psalm. 16. 3. Specially that his
care was to seek out such to serve him as feared God, Psalm. 101. 1. Mine eyes
shall be to the faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me, he that
walks in a perfect way, he shall serve me. This reason the Lord often uses,
Leuit. 19. 2. Ye shall be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy. As if he
should say: because you are my servants, my people, you must frame your selves
to my disposition, and seek to be like me. The Lord therefore being a Spirit
himself, sets his eye upon the spirit and heart of man, to see how he is
served there, 1. Samuel 16. 7. The Lord looks not as a man looks: for man
looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.

His delight is to have service done to him with the spirit and heart, Behold
thou desire truth in the inward parts, says David, Psalm 51. 6. Let the
adorning of a Christian says the Apostle 1. Pet. 3. 4. be the hidden man of
the heart in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and
quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. So that he that
thinks a ceremonial and bodily worship will content the Lord, does judge
erroniously of his nature, and indeed makes an Idol and a false God of him.

But it may be objected, that there seems to be no consequence Object.
in this Reason, the true worshippers must now after Christ's Ascension worship
God in a more spiritual manner, then they have done under the Law, because God
is a Spirit; for God was a Spirit then also, as well as now.

To this I answer, that it is true indeed, and therefore he always required to
be worshipped in spirit, for even to them under Answ.
the Law it was said, Deuteronomie 10. 16. Circumcise the foreskin of your
hearts, and Hosea 6. 6. I desired mercy and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of
God more then burnt offerings. But as the Lord has more clearly revealed
himself now to be a Spirit, to be of a spiritual nature, then he did under
the Law, so he requires spiritual worship of his people now more, then he
did under the Law. Then God revealed himself to his people in many sensible
apparitions, visions, and voices, having respect therein to the infirmity of
his Church, while she was in her childhood. We know the Lord appeared to
Abraham in the body of a man, and talked familiarly with him, as one friend
does with another. Genesis 18. 28. And in a vision to Ezekiel he appeared in the
similitude of a man sitting upon a throne, Ezekiel. 1. 26. So with an audible and
sensible voice, he delivered the Law unto his people, Deuteronomy. 5. 26. In a
sensible and visible manner, he guided his people through the wilderness in a
pillar of cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night, Exodus 13. 51. By a
sensible and material fire that came down from heaven, he witnessed oft-times
his approbation of the sacrifices that his servants offered unto him, 1. Cor.
21. 26. In a sensible and visible manner, his glory filled both the Tabernacle
and the Temple, 2. Chron. 7. 2.

Now since the days of Christ, the Lord has not been wont to reveal
himself to his Church in this corporal and sensible manner, but as he is a
spirit, so in a spiritual manner only has he revealed himself to his Church.
It is therefore spoken of, as a blessing peculiar to the days under the
Gospel, that upon all sorts of his people, he will power his spirit in a far
more plentiful manner, then ever he had done before, Joel 2. 28, 29.

Having now finished the Doctrine that our Savior delivers in these two
verses, and both the Reasons that he brings for the confirmation of it, it
remains that we make our use of it.

The first Use of it is, to condemn the religion of the Papists. If we had no
other reason against Popery; this were sufficient to prove it a false worship,
such as God allows not, because it does every way match, yea far exceeds
the form of worship that was under the Law, even in that point, for which our
Savior does here condemn it. The vestments their Priests use in Gods service,
the Church-musicke and many other things are used in imitation of the Jews.
But 1. In observation of days and times, in the number of their holy days: 2.
In the multitude of their significant ceremonies: 3. In the pomp and worldly
stateliness of their Prelates and Clergy: 4. In their superstitious ringing,
and set service, and other ceremonies about burial: they do far exceed the
Jews.

If that form of worship which God himself appointed under the Law, must
needs be abrogated as Christ has here taught us, and no true worshipper might
use it any longer, because it stood so much in external and carnal rites, in
shadows, and significant ceremonies, then certainly they that use and delight
in such a kind of worship that was but devised by men must needs be deemed
hypocrites and false worshippers of God. See the judgment that our Savior
gives of these kind of ceremonies, and of them that are addicted to them. The
Jews in his time had a ceremony that they would not eat meat before they had
washed often, holding the tradition of the Elders, Mark 7. 3. This might as
lawfully have been used, as any religious ceremony that was devised by man:
for it was not used in Gods service, and might have seemed to be but a civil
ceremony. Yet our Savior discerning that it was enjoined by the Elders, and
was observed by the Jews as a significant ceremony, a Doctrine to the
conscience, a mean to put it in mind of a spiritual duty, Mark 7. 7. A thing
wherein they put holiness, and which they accounted as a worthy service done
unto God, he would not use it himself, Luke 11. 38. and taught his Disciples
to refuse it, and defends them for so doing, Mark 7. 6. And this he did
though he saw it would provoke the Pharisees much, and be likely to draw him
and his Disciples to trouble, Mark 7. 3. And three Reasons he gives against
them. 1. He makes it a certain note of an hypocrite (of a carnal man that
has no soundness of grace in him) to be addicted to these ceremonies, Mark
7. 6. In which respect also (among others) the ceremonial Law is called a
carnal commandment, Heb. 7. 16. and the rudiments of the world, Gal. 4. 3. 2.
That it is a vain worship, Mark 7. 7. there is no profit nor sound
edification that can come to the conscience by it. The Apostle therefore
calls the ceremonies, impotent and beggarly rudiments, Gal. 4. 9. Observe it
well where they are used with most conscience and devotion (as in Popery they
are) they work no knowledge or sanctification in men. 3. That where they are
used, they will make the commandments of God of no authority, Matthew. 15. 6.
They will destroy the power of true piety and godliness, and even eat out the
heart of it. And that was the cause, why Satan labored not in any thing more
busily in the Primitive Church then to bring in again the ceremonial worship,
after God had abrogated it, and the Apostle calls them that were his
instruments in this work, dogs; that is, enemies to all piety, Phil. 3. 2.

The second Use of the Doctrine does more nearly concern our selves: Use 2.
for it teaches us to take heed of hypocrisy in the service of God. Strive to
worship him in spirit and truth, Luke 12. 1. Take heed to your selves (says
our Savior) of the leaven of the Pharisees which is hypocrisy. The Lord does
exceedingly abhor hypocrisy in his service. The more service thou do to
God, the more thou prouokest him if thou be an hypocrite, Job 36. 13. The
hypocrites in heart heap up wrath. For the hypocrite is a false worshipper; he
makes an Idol of God; he thinks he can deceive God as he does men.

Now there be three kinds and degrees of hypocrites that worship not God in
spirit and truth, and are therefore called here by Christ, false worshippers of
God.

1. They that do any service to God with their bodies only, without the
understanding and feeling, and devotion of the heart, in every service we do
to God he calls still for the heart, My son give me thy heart says he, Pro.
23. 26. Paul had not pleased God in preaching, if he had not in preaching
served God in his spirit, Romans 1. 9. Lydia had not pleased God in hearing the
Word, if her heart had not been opened, if she had not heard with feeling and
affection of heart, Act. 16. 14. No man can please God in praying unto him,
unless he pray with the feeling and affection of his spirit, Psalm. 86. 4.
Rejoice the soul of thy servant, for unto thee Lord do I life up my soul; nor
in singing of Psalms, unless he sing with grace in his heart unto the Lord,
Ephesians. 5. 19. Our prayers are compared unto odours, Reu. 5. 8. and unto
incense, Psalm. 141. 2. and the feruency of our affection is as the fire without
which these odours and incense can never send up any sweet savor unto God. In
which respect the Apostle bids us be fervent in spirit as serving the Lord,
Romans 12. 11. as if no service could be acceptable unto God without feruency of
spirit. Let every one of us therefore have a principal care of that, both in
our prayers, and in every other part of the worship we do unto God.

Two good helps are needful to be used to this purpose: 1. Watchfulnes,
Continue in prayer and watch in the same. Col. 4. 2. for unless we have an eye
to, and watch our hearts well, they will be rouing. And as this is needful in
all our prayers, so especially in prescript and set forms of prayer, which we
have often accustomed our selves unto. 2. To set our selves as in Gods presence,
and bring our hearts to a reverent fear of Gods Majesty before whom we
appear, Serve the Lord with fear, Psalm. 2. 11. in thy fear will I worship
toward thine holy temple. Psalm. 5. 7.

The second sort of hypocrites that do not worship God in spirit and truth, 2.
are they that use Gods worship or any part of it, as a matter of ceremony and
formality only, and never seek in it, the edification of the spirit and
conscience. 1. That Preacher is but an hypocrite that seeks not so to preach,
as his preaching may have power in the hearts of his hearers, I will know, not
the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power. For the kingdom of God
is not in word but in power, 1. Cor. 4. 19, 20. And he makes this a note of an
able Minister of the Gospel, when he is the Minister of the spirit, 2. Cor. 3.
6. It is that, we should seek to see Gods seal upon our Ministry in the
hearts of our hearers, The seal of mine Apostleship are ye in the Lord, yea
he says this was his maine answer and defense to them that examined him and
questioned his Ministry, 1. Cor. 9. 2. 3. We had therefore need not only to
preach, but to teach such Doctrine as is profitable, and which particularly
concerns, and is of use to those we teach, this was Paul's direction to Titus,
to teach and stand upon those things in his Ministry that were good and
profitable unto men, Tit. 3. 8. neither only to teach, but to use application
also, Preach the Word, -- reprove, or convince, rebuke, exhort, 2. Tim. 4. 2.
2. Those Christians also are no better then hypocrites, who (so they have a
form of Gods service) never care whether it edify their conscience or no.
Such are they as rest content with a dumb Ministry, for what power feel they
in it? Such also are they as hear good Preachers, and praise them, but never
examine what profit they receive in their conscience by them. When you praise a
good Preacher (whose Ministry you frequent) with your tongue, your life, and
unreformed course does disgrace him. Those hearers only praise their teachers
indeed that have profited in reformation of heart and life by their Ministry;
in whose hearts the spirit of God has written that of their Ministers
commendation, as may be read of all men, 2. Cor. 3. 2.

3. The third sort of hypocrites that worship not God in spirit and truth, are
they that will be devout in the exercises of Religion, and zealous in
profession, 3.
Make a show of godliness, but deny the power of it, 2. Tim. 3. 5. True
Religion where it is received, will command the heart and the whole man. Let a
man profess what he will, if his heart and life be not reformed, he is an
hypocrite; and whatsoever worship he does to God, is but a false worship, We
know that God hears not sinners, but if any man be a worshipper of God, and
does his will, him he hears, John 9. 31. yea the very service he does to God,
does but increase Gods wrath against him: either amend thy life, or give over
serving of God.

THE THREE AND FORTIETH LECTVRE, ON FEBRVARY XXVII. MDCIX.
IOH. IIII. XXV, XXVI. The Woman says unto him, I know that Messiah comes,
which is called Christ, when he is come, he will tell us all things.

Jesus says unto her, I that speak unto thee, am he.


THese words contain the conclusion of that conference that was between our
Savior, and the Woman of Samaria. In the interpretation of the words, for the
help of your memory, these five questions are distinctly to be opened and
resolved.

Whom means she here by Messiah, seeing it is plain, she uses this word
as the proper name of some person. Quest. 1.


I answer, it is evident by the words following, that she means the same Answ.
person that is called Christ. For as our blessed Savior being promised to the
Church from the beginning of the world, was described and made known to them
both by his natures, specially his humane nature; I will put enmity between
thy seed and her seed, it shall bruise thy head, Genesis 3. 15. And Genesis 22. 18.
In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, and by those offices
he should exercise, and whereby he should procure the salvation of his people,
viz. 1. His Prophetical office, I will raise them up a Prophet, from among
their brethren like unto thee, Deuteronomy. 18. 18. His Priesthood, He shall be a
Priest upon his throne, Zach. 6. 13. His Kingly office, Rejoice greatly O
daughter of Zion, shout, O daughter of Jerusalem, behold, thy King comes unto
thee, Zach. 9. 9. and by the place where he should be borne, But thou Bethlehem
Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee
shall he come forth unto me, that is to be ruler in Israel: whose goings forth
have been from old, from everlasting, Mic. 5. 2. So had he three proper names
in the Old Testament, given him: 1. One in respect of his two natures
hypostatically united in one person, Esaias 7. 14. He shall call his name
Immanuel. 2. Another in respect of the obscure place of his education, Zach. 6.
12. Behold the man, whose name is the Branch. 3. A third in respect of his
office, Dan. 9. 25. Messiah the Prince. Now of all the names whereby our
Savior was described in the Old Testament, this name was the most famous among
the Jews. When Herod gathered together all the chief Priests and the Scribes
to resolve him in the question that the Wise men came to Jerusalem to move, he
asked them where Messiah should be borne, Matthew. 2. 4. For though the
Evangelist writing in Greek, use the word Christ in that place: yet it is
certain, that he in his language used the word Messiah. So John 1. 41. We have
found the Messiah, says Andrew to his brother Simon. Now this Hebrew name
Messiah, and the Greek name Christ do in our language signify the anointed
one; and we shall find it was given to sundry others in the holy Scripture,
for the Kings of Gods people were called the Lords anointed, 2. Sam. 19. 21.
and so were the Priests, Leu. 10. 7. and so were the Prophets, Psalm. 105. 15.
Because every one of these were by the ceremony of anointing (as by a
Sacramental sign) assured from the Lord, that he would inwardly anoint them,
that is, endue them with such graces of his holy spirit, as whereby they might
be enabled to discharge those offices that he called them unto, yet was this
name of Messiah, Christ, the anointed of the Lord, made a proper name only
unto our blessed Savior.

1. Because all those Kings, Prophets, and Priests, that by Gods appointment
were anointed among his people, were but types of this King, of this Prophet,
of this Priest; and all the good that Gods people received by them, was but a
figure and shadow of the infinite benefits Gods people should receive by Christ.

2. Christ our Savior only had all those offices, unto which by Gods
ordinance men were anointed. Melchisedech was both a King and a Priest, Genesis
14. 18. David was both a King and a Prophet, 2. Sam. 23. 1, 2. Ezekiel was both
a Prophet and a Priest, Ezekiel 1. 3. But never was there any whom God
anointed to all these three offices, but only our Savior.

3. Though there was never a one of those whom God had anointed to any of
those offices, but they received from him the gifts of his spirit, whereby they
were made fit to discharge those offices; Their anointing was not an empty and
impotent ceremony, but together with the visible sign, they received also the
invisible grace that was signified by it. (Insomuch as we read of Saul, that
though he was but an hypocrite, and one also that had been rudely and basely
brought up, yet so soon as he was anointed, God gave him another heart, an
heroical spirit, the spirit of magnanimity, and the spirit of government, 1.
Sam. 10. 9.) yet our Savior received the spirit, whereby he was made fit to be
a Prophet, Priest, and King, in a far more excellent manner then any of them,
God has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows, Psalm.
45. 7. Nay indeed God gave him not the spirit by measure, John 3. 34. For in
him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, Col. 2. 9. He could never
have discharged these offices: he could not have been our Prophet to teach us
the whole will of his Father; nor our High Priest to offer such a Sacrifice, as
might satisfy the justice of God for our sins, and to make continual
intercession for us; nor our King to vanquish Satan with all other the enemies
of our salvation, and to rule and govern us by his spirit; unless he had had
the spirit in another measure, then any of those anointed ones ever had; nay
indeed unless he had had it above measure, unless the fullness of the
Godhead had dwelt in him: So ye see then for the answer unto the first
question, who is meant here by Messiah, and why our Savior is so called.

The second thing to be inquired for the opening of the meaning of the words is
this, seeing Messiah and Christ are all one name, why uses she both these
words?

I answer these words (which is called Christ) are not the words of the woman
(who spoke in the Syracke language) but of the Evangelist, who writing in
Greek, interprets the Hebrew name Messiah by the Greek name Christ, as he
does likewise in reporting the word of Andrew, John 1. 41. We have found the
Messiah, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.

It may then thirdly be demanded why the Evangelist retains the Hebrew word
Messiah, which was the word the woman used in her own Quest. 3.
language, and yet interprets it by a word of that language, wherein he wrote?

I answer: 1. He uses the Hebrew name Messiah, because it was a Answ.
name so famously known among the Jews. And we shall find that the Apostles
in the New Testament, in reverence of that ancient Church of the Jews, and of
that holy language, in which it pleased God first to pen his Word, have
retained in the New Testament (which they wrote in the Greek tongue) sundry
Hebrew words, as Amen, 1. Cor. 14. 16. Hosanna, Matthew. 19. 9. Halleluiah, Reu.
19. 1. By which warrant also we use now to give to our children in Baptism,
Scripture names, though they be Hebrew names; because though every parent
understand not the signification of them, yet we know, 1. That as the
principal thing we are to respect in giving of names is not the signification
of the name it self, but the desire we have our child may imitate the worthy
example of that person, whose name he bears; so 2. We are sure that to those
men's examples which God has commended to us in his Word, and to those names
which the Holy Ghost has sanctified with his own pen, there is greater
reverence and respect due, then to other. 2. He uses not the name Messiah
without interpretation in a respect he had to the Gentiles, for whose use
specially he wrote his Gospel; that the Ministers of the Gospel may know,
that as they may never in their Ministry use for ostentation, to speak much in
a strange language; so when they are constrained to use a word or two in a
strange language (as sometimes they may be) they be careful to interpret it,
and to speak nothing which the simplest of Gods people they speak unto, may
not understand. This was a thing that Paul took great comfort in, that though
he could speak languages more then all the flaunting and conceited Preachers
among the Corinthians, yet he had rather in the Congregation speak five words,
so as he might be understood and instruct others, then ten thousand in a
strange language, 1. Cor. 14. 18, 19.

The fourth question is, how falls she into this speech of the Messiah?
Quest. 4.
Did she distaste that answer our Savior made to her question, and the speech
he had used in the condemnation of the Samaritans worship? was it her meaning
to put him off, and to reply upon Christ after this manner; well, since thou
give me no better an answer, let us leave this question to be decided by the
Messiah himself when he shall come; he will not be partial either of our side
or yours, but as an equal Judge and vmpire betwixt us, he will indifferently
end and compound all our controversies.

I answer, that is not her meaning, but she approues of Christ's speech, and
Answ.
that that he had said (touching the alteration should be made in the whole
form of Gods worship) puts her in mind of the Messiah coming; as if she
should say, I know this indeed that thou say, there will be shortly a great
alteration made in the Church, for the Messiah comes (the word in the
original is the present tense, not future, as we translate it) he is even
coming, and when he comes, he will tell us all things, that is, all these
things that we speak of, concerning the worship of God, he will teach us far
other wise then we have been taught hitherto. And no marvel, though that
speech of Christ touching so great a change that should be made in Gods worship
shortly, did put her in mind of the Messiahs coming. For it was generally
received, that he when he came would make a great alteration in the Church.
That is the reason why when the Jews heard of the new and strange Ministry
that John the Baptist did exercise, they sent Priests and Levites from
Jerusalem to him to know of him, whether he were the Messiah, for that that was
their question it appears, plainly by his answer, he confessed and cried
not, but confessed, I am not the Christ, John 1. 20. That was one reason why
not Herod only, but all Jerusalem with him were so troubled, when they heard
that the Messiah was borne, Matthew. 2. 3.

The fifth and last question is, how this woman being a Samaritan, should come
to know; 1. That there should come a Messiah; 2. That he was now Quest. 5.
coming: 3. That when he came he should more fully and perfectly instruct the
Church in all things that concern Gods worship and their salvation, then ever
they were instructed before?

I answer; 1. She might know it by hearing that the Jews of all sorts, Answ.
had now for a good while lived in an expectation of the Messiah coming. Even
at that time when Christ was borne, there were many that looked for redemption
in Jerusalem, Luke 2. 38. One while they thought John to be the Messiah, Luke
3. 15. All men mused in their hearts of John, if he were not the Christ.
Another while they thought our Savior himself to be he, as may appear both
by their reasoning among themselves, John 7. 40. Many said of a truth this is
the Prophet; others said this is the Christ; and by the question they move to
him, how long do thou make us to doubt? if thou be the Christ, tell us
plainly, John 10. 24. 2. She might know this well by the books of Moses; for
the Samaritans as well as the Jews did receive the books of Moses: and there
it was written that the Scepter should not depart from Judah, till Shilo came,
Genesis 49. 10. And they all saw that the Scepter was either altogether, or almost
now gone from Judah. So Moses prophesying of him, had said, That he should be
such a Prophet, as God would put his words into his mouth, and he should speak
all that God commanded him, Deuteronomy. 18. 18. Having thus opened the meaning of the
words, let us observe the Doctrine which the holy Ghost intends to teach us
in them.

And first in that this woman, though she were but a Samaritan, no member of
the true Church, and one also that had lived long in gross sin, yet had this
measure of knowledge in the Principles and grounds of the true Religion; for
she knew 1. That the Messiah should come: 2. That he was now coming: 3. That
when he came he would teach the Church all things; and this knowledge she got
not now by conference with Christ, but had it before.

We learn: That it is no certain sign of grace to have some knowledge Doct.
1.
of the truth, knowledge is no grace peculiar to the Elect, but a common gift.
No man has cause to bless himself in this, as in an argument that he is in
the state of grace, that he knows somewhat in Religion: For 1. There be, and
ever have been many very wicked and graceless men, that have had knowledge of
sundry excellent grounds and principles of the truth. Paul says of the wicked
Jews, that they knew Gods will, and were instructed out of the Law, Romans 2.
18. 2. Such there are that are far better persuaded of their own knowledge
then any of Gods servants are: whereas the godly are poor in spirit, ever
complaining of their ignorance; they think they have knowledge enough, they
are highly conceited of their own knowledge, are we blind also? say the
Pharisees, John 9. 40. 3. Yea it cannot be denied that many such have had more
knowledge indeed, then many of Gods children. Judas doubtless knew more, then
many of Christ's good hearers did; and Satan the Prince of darkness knows
the truth much more clearly then many of Gods Elect do; he could say to
Christ even then when he was unknown to the greatest part of the Church, Mar.
1. 24. I know thee who thou art, even that holy one of God. 4. Yea, it is
certain, that the knowledge that many wicked men have, and the high conceit
they have of it, is that that makes them more wicked then otherwise they would
be. What is it that makes them to despise the means of grace, and scorn such
as follow Sermons? Surely, this persuasion, that they know enough for their
salvation, they can say their ten commandments, the Lords prayer, and the
Articles of their faith; they know they must love God above all, and their
neighbors as themselves; they can speak of many parts of the Word, and of the
Principles of Religion. They know Christ dyed for sinners, and that is enough.
Of those men, that may be said, which the Prophet speaks, Esaias 47. 10. Thy
wisdom and thy knowledge, they have caused thee to rebel, and thou have said
in thy heart, I am, and none else. And that which Solomon speaks, Pro. 26.
16. The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit, then seven men that can render a
reason.

Three ways there be, whereby many graceless men attain to some knowledge of
the truth. 1. By the light of nature, for some Principles of the truth, God
has engraven in every man's heart by nature: Romans 1. 19. That which may be
known of God, is manifest in them (that is, in their hearts and consciences)
for (says he) God has showed it unto them. 2. Some of them God goes further
with, for he disposes so of them, in his providence, that they live in his
Church, and under the means; they cannot choose but get some knowledge, even
by tradition, though they have no desire of it, nor love to it at all. Such a
one was this woman. And that makes the Apostle say to the Corinthians: 1. Cor.
8. 1. We know that we all have knowledge. 3. Some the Lord goes yet further
with, for by his Spirit he does enlighten them. The Apostle speaks of such as
may fall into the unpardonable sin, and says they were enlightened: Heb. 6. 4.

The Reasons why God makes this gift of the knowledge of his truth so common,
are worthy to be observed, why he gives such means of knowledge, Reasons.
such measure of knowledge even to wicked men. For we may be sure of this, God
is not so prodigal as to mispend his goods, to cast away his gifts, but where
he bestows them, he sees well he shall make a gain, and advantage of them.

There are therefore two Reasons of it. 1. In respect of the Reprobate. For
this is done to make them inexcusable, and to increase their condemnation. 1.
For, as no wicked man's condemnation shall be so heavy, as his that has had
most knowledge: Luke 12. 48. So to them that God has ordained the most heavy
condemnation, to them he gives the means of knowledge. So speaks the Apostle
even of that divine light that God gives to the natural man by his works, the
invisible things of God from the Creation of the world are clearly seen,
being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and
Godhead, so that they are without excuse: Romans 1. 20. And this is then much
more true of the clearer light he gives men by his Word, Ioh. 15. 22. If I had
not come, and spoken to them, then they should not have had sin, but now have
they no cloak for their sin. Let every man say thus to his own heart, it is the
Lords doing that thou art borne in these days of light, that thy lot is fallen
into such a place, where thou have good means of knowledge, that thou have
attained to knowledge above many others, if thou profit not hereby, and be not
won unto God, certainly, God has determined to glorify himself in thy
condemnation, more then in a thousand others that he has not done so much for.

The second Reason is, in respect of the Elect, that God may use this 2.
knowledge they have, as a preparatiue and help to their conversion, in the
day of their visitation. True it is, that the natural man has nothing in him,
whereby he is able to prepare himself to his conversion. Yea, he is ready to
become the worse (as we have heard) for this knowledge he has of the truth.
But if he be the Lords Elect, one whom he has determined to call, this shall
be his advantage, and he shall have cause to praise God for it, that he has
lived in Gods Church, and among Gods people, where he has heard somewhat of
Religion, and seen some profession of it, that he has had some knowledge in
the grounds, and principles of the truth; yea, if he have but lived under an
ignorant Ministry, where he has heard the Word read only, though that cannot
convert him, nor any are to rest in it; yet that small light he may get by it,
shall be an advantage to him. So was it with this poor Woman, The knowledge
she had gotten by hearing Moses read, and by living so near the Jews, now the
time of her visitation was come, proved an advantage to her. So that which the
Jews heard of John concerning Christ, though for the present they regarded it
not, but rather were offended at it, in the day of their visitation proved an
advantage to them: John did no miracle, but all things that John spoke of this
man were true, and many believed on him there, John 10. 41, 42. So the Apostle
says that the elect Gentiles that had lived among the faithful, to hear
them, and see their good examples, though they hated them for the present, yet
in the day of their visitation, they should praise God, and account this a
great benefit, 1. Pet. 2. 12.

The Use of this Doctrine is, first for conuincing of them, that mislike, Use 1.
we should deny the Church of Rome to be a true Church of Christ, or teach
that they that die in the faith thereof, cannot be saved, or inueigh with any
bitterness against Papists, because (say they) they hold many truths. By this
reason both the Samaritans of old, and the Jews, and the Turks now may be
held to be true Churches, and in the state of salvation.

2. To teach every one of us to seek for knowledge, which is the foundation 2.
of all other graces; without it can no man ordinarily be saved: God will have
all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth, 1. Tim. 2. 4.
Though many miss of salvation, that have some knowledge, yet there is much
more hope of the worst man that has knowledge of the truth, then of the
ciuillest man that is void of knowledge. Of all the sorts of ground where the
seed was cast, that by the high way side was the worst, Matthew. 13. 9. Let
Ministers therefore principally labor to ground their people (by Catechizing)
in the Principles of Religion, because him in whom thou may discern a
competencie of knowledge in the fundamental Principles of Religion, thou
may with comfort admit to the Sacrament, (if his life be not scandalously
wicked) though thou cannot otherwise discern any fruit of the Spirit in him,
because that man has in him (as I may say) the matter and seed of
regeneration. And this should encourage parents to train up their children in
the instruction and information of the Lord; for though 1 many so trained,
prove ungracious; 2 little ones have little sense of that they learn; yet if
they belong to God, this will one day prove an advantage to them.

3. To teach professors not to glory in that they have some knowledge, but to
labor for that which is proper to the Elect. Three differences may be
observed betwixt a Samaritans knowledge, and a true Christians.

1. She received Moses (some parts of the truth) but rejected the Prophets; we
desire to know the whole truth so far forth as God shall give us means, we
refuse not to know any truth, that God has revealed, nor wink with our eyes,
nor content our selves with fragments; but seek to be informed in the whole
body of Religion, in the whole form of Doctrine, Rom 6. 17. Yea we seek to
grow and increase daily in knowledge, 2. Pet. 3. 18. grow in grace and in the
knowledge of the Lord.

2. She though she knew somewhat which she learned of Moses, yet that that
concerned specially her own direction and practice, she knew not* Moses had
plainly enough condemned all Idolatry, Take ye therefore good heed to your
selves (for ye saw no manner of similitude, on the day that the Lord spoke to
you in Horeb, out of the midst of the fire) least ye corrupt your selves and
make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, Deuteronomy. 4. 15, 16. which
yet the Samaritans used. We desire chiefly the knowledge of those points, that
are most necessary and profitable, and most concern our selves, as all John
Baptists good hearers did, as appears by the direction craved of him, Luke 3.
10. 12. 14.

3. Her knowledge had no power in her heart, for she lived in gross
whoredom, notwithstanding it; and therefore was no true knowledge of God: of
the sons of Ely it is said, that because they were sons of Belial, lewd men,
that they knew not the Lord, 1. Sam. 2. 12. our knowledge reformeth and rules
us, and that only deserves the name of true knowledge, the fear of the Lord
that is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding, John 28. 28.

Lecture the four and fortieth, March 6. 1609. JOHN IIII. XXV.
THe last day we heard, that this Woman hearing our Savior speak of an
alteration that should shortly be made in the manner of Gods worship, was
thereby put in mind of the Messiah coming. Concerning which she professes two
things. 1. That she knew well he was coming, his coming could not be far off:
2. That when he should come, he would tell them all things. In the former we
observed the last day, what knowledge of the truth there may be in an
unregenerate and wicked man. It remains now that we proceed to that which she
speaks touching the office of Christ, When he is come (says she) he will
tell us all things. She professes that she knew Christ when he came, would
teach the Church far more excellently, fully and perfectly then Moses and the
Prophets had done. By all things she means only all those things that
concern the worship of God and the salvation of man: as if she should say,
when he comes he will tell us all these things, all such things as we speak
of. So is the word taken also in that speech of Christ, Ioh. 14. 26. The Holy
Ghost whom the Father shall send in my name, he shall teach you all things. So
that which Paul says, Act 20. 27. Of declaring to them all the counsel of
God, he interprets thus, verse 20. I have kept back nothing that was
profitable to you. For many other things before Christ's coming were more
particularly and fully revealed to the Church, then they have been since. You
shall find more spoken in Leuit. 26. and Deuteronomy. 28. of the temporal rewards of
goodness, and of the temporal punishments of sin, then in all the New
Testament. In things and matters concerning this life, the Prophets told more,
and gave more particular and clear direction then Christ has done. When Saul
seeks for his Fathers asses that were lost, he comes to Samuel, and he
tells him of them. When Iehosaphat would know, whether he should have
success when he went with Ahab in battle against Ramoth Gilead, he asks
counsel of the Lord, and sends for the Prophets, 1. Kings 22. 5. 7. When
David feared that Saul would come to besiedge Keilah, and that the men of
Keilah would deliver him into his hands, he asked counsel of God, and received
a direct, and clear answer, 1. Sam. 23. 11. 12. When any was sick, and they
desired to know whether he should dye or escape, they were wont to send to the
Prophet, and he would tell them, 1. Reg. 14. 1, 2. Elisha could tell the King
of Israel the words that his enemy, the King of Aram spoke in his Privy
Chamber, 2. Reg. 6. 12. Now Christ tells us no such things. The Lord under
the Gospel does not give us so clear direction in these outward things. But
in heavenly and spiritual things, that concern Gods worship, and our
salvation, Christ has told us more then Moses and the Prophets; we have a more
clear and perfect direction now, then they had under the Law. In which respect
the light they had then is compared to the light of a candle, that shines in a
dark place, and that which we have now unto the day light, 2. Pet. 1. 19. Of
these spiritual and heavenly things this woman speaks here.

2. For the second point. Though these be not the words of the Evangelist, that
wrote by divine inspiration but the words of a weak sinful woman reported
by the Evangelist, yet may we ground a Doctrine upon them, whereupon our
consciences may safely rest. For 1. Our Savior by his answer approoues and
confirms her speech. 2. This is a truth she learned from the Word of God; she
knew Moses had said thus of Christ, Deuteronomy. 18. 15. 18, 19. The Lord thy God will
raise up unto thee a Prophet like unto me from among you, even of thy
brethren, unto him ye shall hearken. Whereby she well understood he should be
a greater Prophet then Moses.

Then the Doctrine that we are to learn here is this. That Christ since Doct.
2.
his coming has fully and perfectly revealed all things concerning the
salvation of his Church. This honor God reserved unto his Son that he should
teach his Church more fully then the Prophets did.

How, or where has Christ taught us more then Moses and the Prophets, Object.
1.
seeing he taught but three years and a half, or thereabouts, and that but in
Jury only; he did but begin to teach as it is said, Acts 1. 1. Heb. 1. 3.

Surely by the Doctrines and writings of the Apostles. He by word of mouth, and
by his spirit taught the Apostles all things, and by their Doctrine Answ.
and writings has perfectly instructed his Church that shall be to the end of
the world. This is plain, John 15. 15. All things that I have heard of my
Father have I made known unto you, and 17. 8. I have given unto them the word
which thou gave me. After his Resurrection he conuersed with them by the
space of forty days, and instructed them in the things that pertain to the
kingdom of God, Acts 1. 3. And after his Ascension he did yet more fully
instruct them, and by their doctrine and writings the whole Church. This is
that that he says, Ioh. 14. 25, 26. Christ did not teach his Church all things
by word of mouth when he lived upon earth, but by the Ministry and writings of
the holy Apostles. These things have I spoken unto you being present with you,
but the Holy Ghost which the Father will send, he will teach you all things,
and 16. 12. 13. I have many things to speak unto you, but you cannot bear
them now, but when he is come that is the spirit of truth, he will lead you
into all truth. So that in the time of the Apostles he did fully instruct his
Church, and perfectly reveal the whole will of his Father, so as nothing might
after be added unto it.

How can Christ or his Apostles be said to have taught more then was taught
before, seeing that the Scriptures which the Church enjoyed before, did
contain a perfect direction for Gods people, both in faith and manners, and
neither Christ nor his Apostles taught any more then was contained in the
Scriptures, as is evident by that we read, Luke 24. 27. 44, 45. Acts 26. 22.

Three things there are wherein the Scriptures as they are now perfected and
consummate by the writings of the Evangelists and Apostles, do excel the
Scriptures of the Old Testament. 1. Though the Scriptures did before the
Apostles time give clear direction to the people of God in those things that
concerned their salvation. As David could say, the entrance of thy words
gives light, it gives understanding unto the simple, Psalm. 119. 130. yet they
do it now much more plainly and clearly then they did before, that was but a
light that shines in a dark place, (as the light of the Moon or of the
Stars, or of a candle) this as the daylight, 2. Pet. 1. 19. yea the things
contained in the Old Testament are made more plain to us then they were to the
Prophets themselves, of which salvation the Prophets have enquired, and
searched diligently, who prophesyed of the grace that should come unto you.
Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did
minister the things which are now reported unto you, 1. Pet. 1. 10. 12. 2. They
were perfect before the Apostles times, and gave sufficient direction in all
things to the Church that then lived, the law of the Lord is perfect, says
David, Psalm. 19. 7. yea so perfect it was even in Moses time, that it was then
said, ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye
diminish ought from it, Deuteronomy. 4. 2. but now they give a perfect direction to
the whole Church that shall be to the end of the world. It is said that the
whole household of God is built upon the foundation of the Apostles and
Prophets, Ephesians. 2. 20. Yea the Apostles are called the foundations of the new
Jerusalem, Apoc. 21. 14. 3. That had additions made to it in every age, to this
never shall be any, Therefore the Apostle John (who lived to see all the books
of the New Testament written, and the whole body of the Canonical Scripture
perfected and to give his testimony to them all) concludes his book of the
Revelation (which is the last of them all, and of the same and no more divine
authority then all the rest) and so sets his seal to the whole Canon; I
testify unto every man that hears the words of the prophecy of this book;
If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues
that are written in this book, Reu. 22. 18. Therefore the Apostle observes
this difference betwixt the former times, and the times of Christ, Hebrews 1.
1, 2. At sundry times, and in diverse manners, God spoke in old time to our
fathers by the Prophets, in these last days he hath-spoken to us by his
Son: 1. We have a more excellent and perfect teacher given us then they had;
they had the Prophets, we have the Son of God himself. 2. Then God revealed
his will at sundry times, now all at once. In which respect also thirdly, it is
to be marked, that he calls that time wherein Christ and the Apostles lived the
last days, as Acts 2. 17. 1. Pet. 1. 20. And the ends of the world, 1. Cor.
10. 11. Why are they called so, so many 100. years, so many ages before the
worlds end? Surely, because there shall be no more alteration made in Religion,
the will of God shall be no further revealed then it was then, there shall be
no more additions made to that which Christ has taught unto his Church.

The Reasons of this Doctrine are three. 1. It is a part of Christ's
Mediatorship, Reas. 1.
and one of the offices whereunto he was called and anointed of his Father to
be the Prophet and teacher of his Church, so Peter interprets and applies that
place of Moses to be meant of Christ, For Moses truly said unto the Fathers, a
Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto
me, him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say unto you, Acts
3. 22. yea he is called the only Doctor and teacher of his Church, Matthew. 23.
8. 10. One is your Doctor, to wit Christ.

2. There was no want of ability in him to reveal the whole will of his Father
to the Church. For John 1. 18. He is in the bosom of his Father, and 2.
knew all his secrets, and Col. 2. 3. In him are hid all the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge.

3. There was no want of faithfulness in him, he was faithful in his 3.
office as Moses, Hebrews 3. 2. yea more faithful then Moses, Heb. 3. 5, 6.

This Doctrine serves for the improouing and conuincing of three Use.
errors.

First, Of the Papists that deny the perfection of the Scriptures, and still
add traditions and unwritten verities unto them. Christ has taught us all
things, and whatsoever he taught us, he taught it in his own life time, and in
the days of the Apostles. And whatsoever he taught in his own person, is
contained in the Scriptures, Luke 24. 27. 45. Whatsoever the Apostles taught is
contained in the Scriptures, Acts 26. 22. The Scriptures, before Christ and his
Apostles had put the last hand unto them, and revealed all the will of God,
were perfect and sufficient to keep men from damnation, Luke 16. 29. To make
them wise to salvation, 2. Tim. 3. 15. so as the Church then needed no
traditions, nor indeed might receive any, how can they then be imperfect now?

The second error to be improoued by this Doctrine is of them that make too
light account of sundry things that Christ taught by the Apostles, judging them
temporary, and abrogating them at their pleasure; and esteem the direction
that God gave to his Church under the Law, in matters of his service more
clear and perfect then that which he has given to his Church under the
Gospel, and that more is left to the power and discretion of the Church now,
then was then. They grant that then nothing was to be done without Gods
particular direction, neither by the Church, According to all that I show thee,
after the pattern of the Tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments
thereof, even so shall ye make it, Exodus 25. 9. neither by the Magistrate,
David (not as a King but) as a man of God, (a Prophet) commanded the courses of
the Priests, etc. 2. Chron. 8. 14. And of the Musicians that were employed in
the Temple, it is said, that it was done according to the commandment of
David, and of Gad the Kings Seer, and Nathan the Prophet; for so was the
commandment of the Lord by his Prophets, 2. Chron. 29. 25. but now they say
there is more liberty given to the Church then was in those days. But this
conceit is evidently overthrown by this Doctrine. We have heard that Christ
has taught us all things that concern Gods worship; indeed not expressly every
thing that belongs to the circumstances of Gods worship (no more did he under
the Law, no express direction was given, for the hour when the morning and
evening sacrifice should be kept, for setting up the Synagogues or Pulpits, for
the form of burial and marriage) but he has given us rules to direct us in
all these things, and those more clear and certain, and sufficient to resolve
us in all our doubts, and to decide all controversies that may arise about
them, then they had under the Law.

The third error is theirs that hold and put holiness in sundry superstitious
customs touching burial, fasting, etc. for which they have no warrant, but
the tradition of their fathers, as the Apostle speaks of many other vanities,
1. Pet. 1. 18.

The second Use is for reproof of them that are ignorant in these days of the
Gospel when all things are so clearly and fully revealed, that the simplest 2.
person, which with an honest heart shall use the means of knowledge God has
given, may attain to a greater measure of knowledge, of these days it is
prophesied that the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of God, as the
waters that cover the sea, Esaias 11. 9. If then God under the Law did so much
abhor ignorance in the Minister, Hos. 4. 6. in the people, Esaias 27. 11. how
much more in us now? if he required then, that all should be instructed before
they came to the Passover, Exodus 13. 8. how much more now?

3. The third Use is for exhortation and encouragement to learn of Christ,
Matthew. 11. 29. this will bring much rest to our souls, which we must now 3.
do by the written word and ministry thereof, God has committed to us the
word of reconciliation and we are in Christ's stead, as the Apostle teaches, 2.
Cor. 5. 19. 20. And seeing his office is to teach us all things, let us seek
in all things, in every place (as well at home as at the Church) in every
condition of life (in prosperity, adversity, as we are Masters, Servants,
Landlords, etc) in every thing that we go about (as buying, selling, apparel,
recreations, etc) to receive direction from him. In every thing inquire what
says Christ concerning this? What would he have me do? That which Paul says
of marriages and meats, may be said likewise of apparel, recreations, all the
commodities and gains of this life, they are good to us when they are
sanctified by the Word and prayer, 1. Tim. 4. 4, 5. Many will hear Christ
willingly in some things, but in many things they will do as they list,
whereas Acts 3. 22, 23. We should hear him in all things that be shall say
unto us, and every soul that will not hear this Prophet shall be destroyed
from among the people.

THE FIVE AND FORTIETH LECTVRE, ON MARCH, XIII. MDCIX.
IOH. IIII. XXVI. Jesus says unto her, I that speak unto thee, am He.


WE heard the last day, what a confession this Woman of Samaria made of the
Messiah; 1. She knew he would come: 2. She knew his coming was then at hand:
3. She knew that when he should come, he should teach his Church all things
that concerned Gods true worship, and the salvation of man. In these words that
I have now read, and the verse following, two things are set down.

1. How Christ made himself known unto her to be the Messiah, which she spoke
of, verse 26.

2. How this conference between them was broken of, by the coming of the
Disciples, verse 27.

In the first, we are to observe, that it is somewhat strange, that he thus
plainly reuealeth himself unto this Woman here, and to inquire what may be
the reason of it, that so we may receive a doctrine and instruction from it.

1. We shall not find that in any Sermon he made to the Jews, he did ever
manifest himself so plainly to be the Messiah, as he does here to this Woman
of Samaria, and yet we know he was not sent to the Samaritans, but unto the
lost sheep of the house of Israel, Matthew. 15. 24. We read John 10. 24. That
the Jews came about him as he was walking in Salomons Porch, and compassed him
round (that he might not get from them) and expostulated with him in this
manner, how long do thou hold us in suspense; If thou be the Christ, tell
us plainly, yet would he not in plain terms tell them that he was he, yea
when John the Baptist sent two choice Disciples to him to know whether he were
he that should come, or they should wait for another, he makes them not a
plain and direct answer, but bids them show John what works of his they had
seen done, Luke 7. 19. 22. yea he straightly charge his Disciples, Matthew. 16.
20. That they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ, and yet behold
he plainly makes himself known to this poor Woman.

2. The Reason why he vouchsafes this rare favor to this poor Woman is for
that he saw her heart was now prepared to receive the truth; he told her not
so much at the first, till he saw her heart was prepared to receive it: he saw
her heart was now truly humbled in sense of her sin, he saw she esteemed
reverently of his person; he saw she was very desirous of saving knowledge; he
discerned in her a longing desire for the Messiah coming, because she knew
when he came, he would teach his Church all things; and therefore now he thus
plainly reueales himself unto her. In this manner did Christ also deal with
the poor man that was borne blind, when he had heard, what zeal and grace he
had showed in answering of the Pharisees, and enduring of their
excommunication, he sought him out, and finding him, made himself more
plainly known unto him, then he did unto any other almost, Ioh. 9. 3^. 37. To
the Jews in John ^0. ^4. he did not make himself so plainly known, because
he saw they sought it out of an evil purpose. And he charged his Disciples not
to make him known, because he saw the people were not yet prepared to receive
this truth.

This then is the Doctrine that we are to learn here. That the Lord will
Doctrine
clearly reveal himself, to all such as with an humble and honest heart do
desire to know him.

When God has thus prepared the heart of any, and made it 1. Humble in sense
of his own ignorance and sin. 2. Unfeignedly desirous of saving knowledge. 3.
Desirous of it with an honest heart and purpose to obey the truth, he never
uses to leave it there, but is wont further to reveal his saving truth unto
that soul

See how this is confirmed in all these three particulars. For the first: Psalm.
25. 9. They that be meek shall he guide in judgment, and teach the humble his
way, The man that sees his ignorance and corruption, is poor in spirit, and
mournes for nothing so much as for it, you see God has promised he will teach
him his way For the second: the blessed Virgin says in her Song that this has
ever been Gods manner, Luke 1. 53. To fill the hungry with good things, and to
send the ri^h away empty, to such as unfeignedly and earnestly desire to know
Christ, he will undoubtedly reveal himself. For the third: Psalm 25. 12. What
man is he that fears the Lord, him shall he teach in the way that he shall
choose. And verse 14. The secret of the Lord is revealed to them that fear him,
and his Covenant to give them understanding, John 14. 21. He that loves me,
shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and show mine own self
unto him. And Psalm. 50. 23. To him that disposes his way aright, will I show
the salvation of God. Such as with an honest heart desire to be taught of God,
because they fear to offend him, because they love him, and desire to please
and serve him, such he will teach the way they should choose, he will reveal
his secrets to them even the secret of all secrets, his decree touching their
eternal election.

The Reasons of this are three. 1. The good pleasure of God, The free, and
Reas. 1.
infinite love the Lord bears to them that are his. This Reason our Savior
gives: Mat. 11. 26. even so Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.

2. The unchangeableness of this love of God, and care he has to perfect 2.
his own work: according to that, to every one that has shall be given, and
he shall have abundance, Mat. 25. 29. And that speech of the Apostle, Phil. 1.
6. Being confident of this very thing, that he which has begun a good work in
you, will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.

3. The respect God has to his own glory, which he knows he shall receive
thereby according to that, Psalm 50. 15. I will deliver thee, and thou 3.
shall glorify me.

This ser^es 1. To answer them (be they Papists, or carnal Protestants) Use 1.
that are wont to complain so much of the difficulty and obscurity of the
Scriptures, they say it is not possible for a man by reading or learning the
Word, to grow unto any certainety in Religion. The Scriptures say they are very
obscure, and there is great difference even amongst learned men about the
interpretation and meaning of them. Therefore say the Papists, 1. It is the
safest way to depend upon the Church for the interpretation of the Scriptures.
2. And to receive only that in the matters of our Faith and Religion, which the
Church teaches. Therefore (say they) 3. It is not fit that common people
should meddle with the Scriptures, but it is meet they should content
themselves to believe as the Church believes. Therefore also says the carnal
Protestant, it is to no purpose to trouble our selves with the reading of the
Scriptures, or to busy our heads about matters of Religion, it is sufficient
to know God is merciful, and to believe Christ died for sinners, and there is
an end.

Before we give ^ull answer to these men, three things are to be granted. 1.
That the Scriptures, and matters of faith and Religion set down in them, are
indeed obscure and hidden from most men. No man by his own wit and learning,
shall ever be able to attain to a sound and comfortable understanding, and a
full persuasion in these things, therefore Paul says: 1. Cor 2 7. We speak
the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, verse 8. Which
none of the Princes of the world has known, and verse 14. The natural man
receives not the things that are of the Spirit of God, for they are
foolishness to him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
discerned. Therefore is the true Religion of God called a hidden treasure,
Matthew. 13. 44. Many things there be that hide this treasure from most men. 1.
The obscurity of the Scripture. 2. The differences and dissentions that are
amongst learned men about it. 3. The scandalous life of such as profess it. 4.
The great disgrace that it is in with the world. These and such like things are
so many means whereby this treasure is hidden from most men. 2. There be some
things obscure in the Scripture to the best of Gods servant, For that which
Peter said of Paul's Epistles: 2. Pet. 3. 16. may much more be said of the whole
volume. The best learned of Gods servants may well profess they understand not
all things: you know who it was that said, we know but in part, 1. Cor. 13. 9.
3. The true Church and Ministry thereof is a necessary help ordained of God to
bring his people to the true understanding of his Word, neither does God
ordinarily instruct his people but by this means, for so said the Eunuch: Acts
8. 31. How can I understand except some man do guide me.

But yet for answer unto these men, these three things we must know.

1. The cause why the Scripture is so difficult, and this treasure is hidden
from most men, is not in the Scripture it self, but in the blind and corrupt
heart of man. To the carnal man it is dark, he cannot understand it, (no more
then the blind man can see the light of the Sun when it shines most bright)
But to the man whose eyes God has opened, whose heart God has prepared, the
Scriptures are very plain. All those points the knowledge whereof is necessary
to salvation are plainly set down in them, so as the simplest man that
comes to the reading of them with an honest heart may clearly understand
them, that that is more darkely set down in one place, is clearly set down
in another. This is that, that David speaks, Psalm. 119. 130. The entrance into
thy Word shows light, and gives understanding unto the simple. And Proverbs
8. 9. They are all plain to him that understands, and straight to him that
would find knowledge.

2. There is no man, that with an humble and honest heart, desires to know God,
but God will give him a good teacher. God has that care of them whose hearts
he has thus prepared, that he will provide his ordinance for them. This you
may see in the example of the Eunuch, Acts 8. 26. 29. and of Cornelius, Acts
10. 20. and of the Macedonians, Acts 16. 9, 10. And this I dare confidently
say, that the people that want a good Teacher (whatsoever their Patron be, how
bad soever the times be) if they had good hearts, and could unfeignedly desire
to be instructed, God would send them better means. The Lord of the harvest is
neither so careless, nor so poor or mean a person, that he should suffer any
of his corn to be lost for want of laborers to inn it.

3. There is no man, that with an humble and honest heart desires to know God,
but God will in his hearing and reading clearly reveal himself, make
himself and his will clearly known unto him, so far forth as it shall be
necessary and good for him. The Spirit that indicted the Scripture will
interpret them to such, and resolve them in the true meaning of it. John 6. 45.
It is written in the Prophets, and they shall be all taught of God. And Matthew.
5. 8. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Yea, so certainly
and clearly will he reveal his will to such, as that though the whole Church
should (if that were possible) judge otherwise, it should not move him, He
that is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is judged of no man, 1.
Cor. 2. 15. If the faithful Martyrs even simple men and women, had not been
thus taught of God, and thus clearly and certainly resolved in the truth,
could they have suffered such things as they did, with such constancy and
cheerfulness? This reason the Apostle gives for this constancy in suffering:
2. Tim. 1. 12. For which cause I also suffer these things: Nevertheless I am
not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.

How chance you differ then so much among your selves, Caluinists from Object.
Lutherans, and Puritans from Protestants?

We deny not but Gods own people may be ignorant in some parts of his Answ.
truth. God has not promised to any the perfect knowledge of every thing that
is revealed in his Word; but in fundamental points, God has promised to give
by his spirit clear direction, to all such as truly fear him, and with an
honest heart do earnestly desire it. And in such points, we do all agree.

Every Schismatique and Heretic will pretend for themselves, that they Object.
have the spirit, and that they are thus taught of God.

Does it follow, that none have it, because that there be very many Answ.
that pretend to have it, that have it not? Shall Gods promise be therefore
false, and fulfilled to none, because there be very many to whom it was never
made, that do falsely challenge an interest and right unto it?

2. The spirit and the interpretation that it gives of any place that is any
way difficult or obscure, is to be clearly discerned by this, if it be
consonant to the Scriptures in other places that are more plain, Esaias 8. 20.
To the law an^ ^o the Testimony, if they speak not according to this word, it
is because there is no light in them.

Application. 1. When therefore thou go to read or hear, labor to bring
with thee an humble and honest heart, fearing God, 1. Pet. 2, 1, 2. Laying
aside all malice, and all guile, etc. As newborn babes, desire the sincere
milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.

2. If thou can learn nothing, grow to no certainety in thy Religion, though
thou read and hear much, and do thy endeavor to serve the Lord in all
things, yet the Lord has not made himself known unto thee, examine and find
out the true and just cause, lay the fault where it is, upon the badnesse of
thine own heart, and upon nothing else.

2. The second Use is to show how necessary it is, that every Preacher Use 2.
should be a sanctified and godly man; for they of all men, had need to be
taught of God. Now the Lord (as we have heard) uses not to reveal his secrets
to any, but to those that fear him with all their hearts. A man of a proud and
profane heart, and of a dissolute life, say he be the greatest Doctor, the
most learned and eloquent man that lives, yet can he not indeed be a sound and
good Divine. He cannot himself have any sound and comfortable understanding in
the matters of salvation, neither can any of Gods people have any sure or sound
hope, to receive resolution from him in the doubts and perplexities of their
consciences. Therefore see how God commends this Ministry of godly men,
Malachie 2. 5, 6. I gave him my fear, and he feared me, and was afraid
before my name. The Law of truth was in his mouth and iniquity was not found
in his lips, he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many
from their iniquities. And so is the Ministry of Barnabas commended unto us
likewise, Acts 11. 24. He was a good man full of the Holy Ghost, and of faith.

Application. 1. This should therefore be our chief study, to have good and
sanctified hearts, this is the only way to make us good Divines, 2. Tim. 2.
15. stand to show thy self approved unto God.

2. And for you that are Gods people, when you hear the credit and learning of
any Divine spoken of, to discredit any truth of God, that you have learned (as
the manner has always been, have any of the Rulers or of the Pharisees
believed him? Ioh. 7. 48) mark what manner of men they be; true it is, That
though an Angel from heaven teach any other Gospel then that we received, we
should account him accursed, Gal. 1. 8.

But if they be proud and pompous men, if worldly and covetous, if licentious
and dissolute, if utterly void of all care to reform themselves and their
families, know you that it is a very unlikely thing, that these men should be
of any great judgment in matters of God and his Religion. This rule the
Apostle gives, I beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and
offenses -- for they that are such, serve not the Lord Jesus Christ but their
own belly, Romans 16. 17, 18. And it is madness for Christians to be moved
much with the credit and authority of such men.

3. The third Use is for the comfort of such as unfeignedly fear God, Use 3.
and desire nothing more then to know his will that they might obey it. Many
such are often in great doubts and perplexities, and complain that they cannot
be certain of their salvation; the Lord Jesus their Savior does not show
himself to them; they cannot profit by that they hear or read; they are
discouraged from reading, because they profit so little by it. To such I say in
the Name of the Lord, Do thou unfeignedly fear and serve God? Would thou
do nothing that might offend him? ^hast thou no grief to this that thou can
not serve and please God as thou would? Then 1. Certainly (though he hide
himself from thee for a time,) before it be long, he will reveal himself to
thee, and he will show thee his salvation; he will give thee that certainety as
thou shall be able to die with comfort; for Psalm. 145. 19. He will fulfill the
desire of them that fear him, he also will hear their cry, and will save
them.

2. In the mean time, comfort thy self in the consideration of these two
points. 1. That this very desire that is in thee, is an infallible fruit of
grace, nourish it, and make much of it, so long as thou can find this, be
sure thou art in the state of grace, for if there be first a willing mind, it
is accepted according to that that a man has, and not according to that he
has not, 2. Cor. 8. 12. 2. That the Lord withholds from thee this certainety,
and continues thee in these doubts to humble thee, and to prepare thee better
for the receiving of his grace.

THE SIX AND FORTIETH LECTVRE, ON MARCH, XX. MDCIX.
IOH. IIII. XXVII. And upon this came his Disciples, and marvelled that he
talked with the Woman, yet no man said, what seek thou? or, why talkest thou
with her?


THe last day we finished the conference that was between our Savior and the
Woman of Samaria. In these words, the Evangelist reports how, and by what
occasion this conference was broken of. By this time that our Savior had so
plainly made himself known to her to be the Messiah, and not before, the
Disciples were come back unto Christ, from the town Sychar, whither they had
gone to buy meat, as verse 8. and upon their coming (whether it were from the
bashfulnesse and modesty of the Woman, that was not willing in the presence of
so many men to have any further speech; or whether it came from the reverence
that she bare to Christ, that she would not now trouble him any longer, seeing
meat was brought for him to go to dinner, or whether it proceeded from the
desire she had to make have to call her neighbors) but upon the coming of the
Disciples the conference brake off; not before their coming; for they saw him
talking with her, but before they came so near, that they could hear any
thing that they said, the speech brake off. Now the Disciples perceiving him a
good while (it seems) before they came near him to be in earnest talk and
conference with a Woman, maruailed at it, as not conceiving any reason why he
should so do, but thinking it unbeseeming the gravity and dignity of his
person, and the holiness of those matters which they knew he was only wont to
talk of, that he should confer with a Woman. Yet such was the reverence they
did bear unto him, that (though they did conceive some dislike of this in
their minds) they durst not utter or express it.

So that th^se words offer to our consideration two principal points.

1. Concerning the providence of God in disposing of the time of the Dis^es
returning unto Christ.

2. Concerning the Disciples themselves. And of them we have two things to
^serue 1. Their maruelling to see him talk and confer with a Woman. 2. Their
silence.

For the First, in that God in his providence did so dispose, that the
Disciples should not only be all away when this Woman came to the Well* (For
else 1. Christ should not have had any occasion to ask her water, verse 7, 8.
Nor 2. Christ could have had fit opportunity to tell her of her secret and
f^wle sin she lived in. Nor 3. she could have been bold to open her mind to
him.) But 2. Also that they should tarry so long away, till Christ had even
finished his conference with her; And 3. That they should come presently, so
soon as he had made himself known unto her to be the Messiah, and not
before: We learn:

That God by his providence does govern all things, even the least things
Doct. 1.
that fall out in the world, and orders them for the good of his Elect. Mark
the confirmation of this Doctrine in these six particulars.

1. Not such things only as come to pass by an ordinary course that he has
set in nature, and we can conceive a reason for, but those that seem to hap
by mere chance, fall out by his providence. See a case of chance-medley
propounded, Deuteronomy. 9. 5. for relief of whom the City of refuge is appointed. In
this case it is said, Exodus 21. 13. The Lord offered him into his hand, and
Pro. ^6. 31. The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is
from the Lord.

2. Not matters of great moment only, but the least matters of all, and such
as man's foolish reason would think it unbeseeming the Majesty of God to take
notice of, even such fall out by his providence, even to the falling of a
Sp^row to the ground, Matthew. 10. 29.

3. Even such things as wherein man has free will (as in natural and civil
actions he has) fall out by Gods providence. The Disciples going to Sychar to
buy meat, and their coming back to their master, sooner or later, was a matter
wherein they had free will, and yet we see Gods special providence even
orders this matter. See another example in this kind, Genesis 24. 15. 20.
Rebecca comes to the Well, just at that time, when Abraham's servant, that was
sent to seek a wife for Isaac came thither, she let him drink of her
pitcher, she offers to draw water for his Camels. And the Holy Ghost notes, God
had a special hand in this, verse. 21. 26.

4. He does not only see and permit, whatsoever falls out in the world, but he
has an hand in every thing, he is an agent in it, Ephesians. 1. 11, He works all
things according to the good pleasure of his will, Esaias 45. 7. I form the
light, and create darkness, I make p^ace and create evil, I the Lord do all
these things.

5. He has not only a hand in the actions of his children, but he is an agent
in all the actions of the wickedest man, and of Satan himself, to order and
direct them. When the Sabeans and Caldeans, and the tempest that Satan raised,
had spoiled Io^ of his goods and servants and children, he professes it was
the Lord that did all this, Job (...). 21. and the Holy Ghost adds verse. 22.
that in saying so, he did not charge God foolishly. The worst action that ever
was done in the world, was the killing of the Lord of life, and yet we shall
find, Acts 4. 28. God had a hand in that, his enemies did nothing but what his
hand and his counsel determined before to be done.

6. In the governing and ordering of all things even the least matters that
fall out, he has special respect to the good of his Elect. The Disciples
going here to the town when they did, and tarrying there so long as they did,
was a matter of small moment; yet did God order and direct this matter by his
providence, for the good of this poor Woman. If they had not gone when they
did, and tarryed as they did, she could not have had this blessed opportunity to
confer with Christ, which was the means of her salvation. See another
example in Genesis 27. 34. Old Isaacke bids Esau go kill him some Venison, and
dress it to his liking; Rebecca hearing him, she teaches Jacob to beguile and
lie unto his Father; Jacob brings his Father meat; and the old man blessed him;
immediately, when Jacob was scarce gone out from his Father, Esau comes in, and
not before. God had a hand in all this, if Isaak had not said so to Esau, if
Rebecca had not heard him, if she and Jacob had not used this policy (which in
them both was wicked) if Esau had not tarried so long in the field as he did,
Jacob had not had the blessing.

The Reason of this Doctrine; why God by his providence gouernes all things,
even the least things that fall out in the world is, 1. The respect that Reas.
1.
he has to his own glory.

To flesh and blood it seems to make nothing for Gods glory but for his
dishonor rather to have an hand in every small matter; especially in the
actions of ungodly men; but indeed it is otherwise. As there is no creature so
small and contemptible, but God receives glory by it, or else he would never
have made it, he has made all things for himself, Pro. 16. 4. Which is the
cause why David exhorts all his works in all places of his Dominions to praise
the Lord, Psalm. 103. 22. and more particular, Psalm. 148. 7, 8. Dragons, and
all depths, fire and hayle, snow and vapors, stormy winds; yea and verse 10.
Beasts and all cattle, creeping things, and feathered foul. So is there no
action, or accident that falls out in the world, be it never so small, be the
instrument never so wicked; but God will receive glory by it, else he would
never permit it, much less have a hand in it, as we have heard he has. This
is manifest in that form of thanksgiving which our Savior teaches us to
use as a reason of all our petitions, Matthew. 6. 13. For thine is the kingdom,
and the power and the glory, for ever. And in that of the Apostle, Romans 11.
36. For of him, and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory
for ever. Therefore says he, 2. Tim. 2. 20. In a great house there are not
only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, some to
honor, and some to dishonor. The lewdest men are Gods vessels, and such as
he has necessary use of.

2. The special and fatherly affection he bears to his children i^ Christ, as
there is no wise and good Father, but (how many, how great or public soever 2.
his affairs be in the midst of them all, he will have a special care of his
own children, have them in special remembrance) so is it with our heavenly
Father, the very hairs of your head are numbered, Mat. 10. 30. And he is the
Savior (or preserver) of all men, specially of those that believe, 1. Tim. 4.
10.

The Uses of this Doctrine are of two sorts. 1. More general. 2. More
special. The general Use is this. Labor to be fully persuaded of this Use 1.
truth, Job 5. 27. Hear thou it, and know it for thy good; and to see and
discern this providence of God in all thy ways, and in all things that have
befalne thee in the whole course of thy life; in thy wealth and poverty; good
and ill successes; marriage, children, dwellings, credit, discredit, health,
sickness, life, and death. This is Salomons counsel, Pro. 3. 6. In all thy
ways acknowledge him. Thus did David, Psalm. 139. 3. Thou compassest my paths
and my lying down, and art accustomed to all my ways. And this will yield
unto a man many unspeakable comforts. Some few of those many I will name unto
you, and they shall serve for those more special uses I told you this Doctrine
served unto.

1. To persuade us to the use of prayer. They that are assured God by his
providence orders all things, and the good success of every thing we take in
hand depends upon his providence, must needs be careful to commend the
success of every thing they take in hand unto God by prayer. Our Savior
teaches us to use this as a reason, why we beg all good things of God,
because his is the kingdom and the power, Matthew. 6. 13. When Abraham's servant
was to take a journey, he commends it to God by prayer, Genesis 24. 12. When
Nehemiah was to make a suit to the King his Master, he commends it to God by
prayer, Neh. 1. 11. and 2. 4. When Christ was to feed the people, he commends
the creatures to Gods blessing by prayer, Matthew. 14. 19. Yea the Apostle says,
that marriage and every creature of God is sanctified to us by the Word and
prayer, 1. Tim. 4, 5. And on the contrary side, the chief or only cause why
men neglect to pray, is that men know not, or believe not this Doctrine of Gods
providence, when David had said that the fool says in his heart there is no
God, Psalm 14. 1. he give this for one reason to prove it, verse 4. they call
not upon the Lord.

2. It will free the heart from those cares wherewith it is wont to be
disquieted and vexed about the success and event of things. The time and
success of every thing and action is appointed of God, and depends wholly on
his providence, To every thing there is a season (appointed of God he means)
and a time to every purpose under the heaven, as Solomon shows at large
Eccles. 3. 1 -- 8. And thereupon he infers, verse 9. What profit has he
that works, in that wherein he labors? seeing things do not depend only
or principally upon the labor or endeavor of any man; It is therefore a vain
thing for men to disquiet themselves with care of the success of things, a man
must do his duty enjoined him of God, and (with a quiet and cheerful heart)
commit the success unto him alone. Many have no heart to do good duties God
calls them unto, because they can see no likelihood of good success; many vex
themselves with care and fear of that that may fall out hereafter. He that
truly is persuaded of Gods providence, is free from this care, when he has
done his duty, and commended the matter to God by prayer, he casts his care for
the success wholly upon God, to whom only it belongs, Be careful for
nothing: (says the Apostle, Phil. 4. 6.) but in every thing by prayer and
supplication, with thanksgiving, let your request be made known unto God,
Cast all your care upon him, for he cares for you, 1. Pet. 5. 7. This is able
to free our hearts from care concerning our children (even at the hour of
death) have thou labored to bring them them up in Gods fear, given them good
education, commended them to God? cast thy care then upon him.

3. It will work patience in all afflictions, I was dumb, I opened not my
mouth, because thou did it, Psalm. 39. 9. See a notable example for this, 2.
Sam. 16. 10. Who dare then say, wherefore have thou done so. See the use Job
makes of this in affliction, Job 1. 20. 22. 1. It kept him from charging God
foolishly. 2. It made him rent his garment, shave his head, fall down to the
ground and worship God. 3. It made him give thanks, this was much, but no more
then his duty, 1. These. 5. 18. In all things give thanks. He knew that since
God the ordering of it, it should tend to his good in the end, 2. Sam. ^6. 12.
It may be the Lord will look upon mine affliction, and do me good for his
cursing this day.

4. It works security in the heart, and quietness from all fear of wicked
men, and of Satan himself. And it is not possible that any (who considers
rightly how infinite dangers his life is subject to, how many witches, how many
vile men there be) should be without continual fear, were it not for this.
For what is it that preserues us from danger? surely the Lords providence.

1. He so ouer-rules their hearts (for without him, neither Satan, nor wicked
men can move, in him all live and move and have their being, Act. 17. 28.)
that they have not so much as a will or desire to practice any mischief
against us, Exodus 34. 24. No man shall desire thy Land.

2. He watches and keeps us and our houses, Behold he that keeps Israel
shall neither slumber nor sleep, The Lord is thy keeper, Psalm. 121 4, 5. He
wat^heth us when we are asleep, and protecteth us from many unknown dangers,
without any care or forecast of ours, when Joseph was asleep he admonishes
him of the danger they were in, Matthew. 2. 13. This is that that Job professes,
that in the days of his youth and prosperity, Gods secret (for so it is in the
original) was upon his tabernacle, that is, his hidden and secret providence,
protecting him and blessing him in a hidden and secret manner, Job 29. 4. And
2. What is it that frees the heart from fear of all dangers, surely the
knowledge and persuasion of the providence of God, The Lord reigns, let the
earth rejoice, Psalm. 97. 1. I will both lay me down in peace and sleep, for
thou Lord only make me dwell in safety, Psalm. 4. 8 and 31. 14, 15. I
trusted in thee and said, thou art my God, my times are in thy hand. So Luke
13. 31. 33. When the Pharisees came and said to Christ, Get thee out, and
depart hence, for Herod will kill thee. See how he secures himself by the
knowledge of his fathers providence, Go ye and tell that fox (says he)
behold I cast out devils, and do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day
I shall be perfected, nevertheless I must work to day and to morrow, and the
day following. He knew God in his providence had set down the just time and
moment, how long his liberty and life should last, and when it should have an
end; and that neither Herod nor all the men in the world could alter that time.

Lecture the seven and fortieth, March 27. 1610. JOHN IIII. XXVII.
WE heard the last day, that these words did offer to our consideration two
principal points: 1. The time when the Disciples returned from the town to
their master, and found him talking with the Woman, in these words, upon that
came his Disciples. 2. How they were affected with it, when they came and found
him talking with a woman. From the first (in that the Lord disposed, that the
Disciples should not only be all away when this Woman came to the Well, but
should tarry away so long and not return, till Christ had plainly revealed
himself unto her to be the Messiah,) we learned the last day, that God by his
providence does govern all things, even the least things that fall out in the
world, and orders them for the good and benefit of his Elect. It remains
now that we come to the 2. part of this verse, and consider how the Disciples
were affected with it, when they found their master talking with a woman. And
concerning this, 2 things are noted by the Evangelist: 1. They marvelled, that
he talked with a woman. 2. Though they did marvel at it, and inwardly dislike
it somewhat, yet no man said, What ask thou, or why talkest thou with her?
Now for their maruailing (before we can receive our instruction from it) we are
to inquire what should be the cause of it.

Four things there be, whereof every one may be thought a cause, why they
marvelled to see him talk with the woman.

1. They might marvel to see him talk with a Woman, whom they knew to be a
Samaritan, specially so long and earnestly, because of the inueterate
strangeness, and alienation of heart, that was between the Jews and the
Samaritans. But that could not be the cause of their maruelling at this time;
for then the Evangelist would not have said, They maruailed that he talked
with a woman; but they maruailed that he talked with that woman, or with such a
woman.

2. They might marvel to see him talk with so wicked a Woman. For this was a
thing generally distasted among all the Jews, and that which they took great
offense at, to see him show any kindness, or familiarity to any infamous
person, they all murmured saying, that he was gone to be guest with a man that
is a sinner, Luke 19. 7. But that could not be the cause of their maruelling at
this time: for 1. Her sin was secret and unknown unto them: 2. If that had
been the cause of their maruelling, the Evangelist would not have said, They
marvelled that he talked with a woman, but they marvelled that he talked with
that woman, or with such a woman.

3. They might marvel to see him talk in this manner, so long, and so
familiarly with a woman alone, and with such a woman especially, as was
unknown unto them, for this they knew he had not been wont to do. Our
Savior, though he could not possibly receive any hurt by it, as any other man,
even the chastest and holiest man may do (and that made Joseph himself to shun
it carefully, Genesis 39. 10.) yet, can we not read, that ever he used in private
and secret manner, to keep company with any woman, because he would teach us
by his example, to shun not only all evil, but all show and appearance of
evil also. Therefore (as malicious as the Jews were, and ready to take the
least occasion to slander him) yet did they never object any thing against him
in this kind.

But neither could this be the cause of their maruelling at this time, for 1.
They knew him to be the Son of God, and therefore could not entertain the
least suspicion of evil against him: 2. The place where he talked with her,
was so open, and commonly frequented, and it was also at such a time of the
day, as might well have freed any man of good report from all suspicion in this
kind.

There remains only a fourth and last, which I take to be the only true
cause of their maruelling. They might marvel to see him talk in this manner
with a woman, because they knew he was wont to confer of no matters, but
only such as concerned the kingdom of heaven, and they (in their ignorance
and carnal reason) thought it a very unfit thing that he should speak of such
matters to a woman; they marvelled therefore, that he would confer with a
woman. Then from this, that the Disciples did marvel, and that not one or two,
but all of them to see Christ talk with a woman, and marvelled for this cause;
for that they thought the matters he was wont to speak of, were too high and
excellent to be communicated to a woman; we have this Doctrine to learn:

That the baseness of the persons to whom the Lord is wont to reveal Doct. 2.
himself, is a matter of great offense unto flesh and blood.

There is scarce any one thing that flesh and blood does more repine at, that
more alienateth men from Christ and his Religion then this, that he passes by
them, that in the eye of the world are more worthy, and calls and reuealeth
himself to such as are mean and unworthy persons, Brethren, ye see your
calling (that is, what manner of persons God is wont to call, and to choose out
of the world to make his peculiar people) that not many wise men after the
flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called, but God has chosen the
foolish things of the world to confound the wise, etc. 1. Cor. 1. 26, 27, 28.
Our Savior calls the kingdom of heaven, Matthew. 13. 44. A hidden Treasure. And
surely there is nothing hides it more from men, and makes them unable to
discern this treasure then this.

The truth of this Doctrine we shall the better discern, if we look into
four sorts which the Lord has had most respect unto this way, and whereat the
world has taken great offense. He has often had more respect, 1. To men of
mean condition for wealth, wisdom and authority, then to men of better
degree and account: 2. To young men then to the ancient: 3. To persons that
have been infamous, then to men that have lived ciuilly and unblameably: 4. To
women more then to men.

For the first. For one man of degree, and note in the world (for birth,
wealth, wisdom, and authority) the Lord has been wont to call many of the
meaner, and baser, and simple sort. This is plain, 1 Cor. 1. 26. And Mat. 11.
2^. Thou have hid these things from the wise, and prudent, and have revealed
them unto babes. And Iam. 2. 5. Hearken my beloved Brethren, has not God
chosen the poor of this world that they should be rich in faith, and heirs,
etc. And how natural men have stumbled at this you shall perceive by that
speech of the Pharisees, have any of the Rulers, or of the Pharisees, believed
on him? but this people which knows not the Law are cursed, Ioh. 7. 48, 49.
and by that speech of our Savior, who when He had told John's Disciples: the
poor receive the Gospel, adds presently, blessed is he that shall not be
offended in me, Matthew. 11. 5, 6.

2. The like may be said of the second sort. The Lord has often given more
grace, more zeal, and faithfulness, more piety, and conscience of their
ways, to many young men then he has to them of riper years. For zeal where
shall we find among all the Kings, such a one as young Josiah, 2. Chron. 34.
3. Or for faithfulness among all the Prophets, such a one as young Samuel, 1.
Sam. 3. 20. Yea, for wisdom and true discretion among all Job's friends, such
a one as young Elihu was: Job 42. 7. And this also the world has ever repined,
and stumbled at. See an example of this corruption, Matthew. 21. 15, 16. When
they heard the children cry Hosanna, they disdained, and said, hear thou,
etc. so that Christ was feign to make an Apology for them.

3. For the third sort that I propounded. The Lord has often had more respect
this way, unto some that have been formerly infamous in the world, for their
lewd life: and has vouchsafed more grace, and zeal to such, then he has done
to sundry, that (to the judgment of men) have lived a civil, and unblameable
life. Christ bids himself to Zacheus house, which we never read he did to any
other, Luke 19. 5. After his Resurrection he appears first to Mary Magdalen,
out of whom he had cast seven devils, Mark 16. 9. He honored Paul (that had
been a notorious persecuter and blasphemer) with more abundance of gifts, and
success in his labors, then any of the Apostles beside, 2. Co. 11. 23. And 1.
Cor. 15. 10. Now this has also ever been a matter of great scandal to the
natural man, when the Pharisees saw what respect our Savior showed unto
Publicans they murmured, saying, this man receives sinners and eats with
them, Luke 15. 2. And of the elder brother (who was a type of the wicked and
hypocritical Jews) it is said, Luke 15. 28. that when he heard that his
father had received with such joy his Prodigal son, he was angry and would
not go in.

4. For the fourth sort. God has often revealed himself further: and given more
grace, more tenderness of conscience, more zeal, more love to him, and his
truth, yea (which is stranger) more knowledge, more resolution, and courage,
more constancy in good duties unto many women, then unto men. Examples are
infinite in this case; I must make choice but of a few: Exodus 38. 8. See the
zeal of many women in the first establishing of Gods Religion under the Law.
1. They used to flock together unto the Tabernacle. 2. They were wont to come
betimes, and give attendance at the door of the Tabernacle. 3. They were
content to bestow the best things they had (even their looking glasses) upon
Gods Sanctuary. And of Samsons mother we read, that (though her husband Manoah
were a holy, and good man, yet) Christ appears to her, rather then to her
husband; Judges 13. 9. gave her more knowledge, faith, and resolution, then her
husband; yea, makes her his instrument to confirm, and comfort him, verse 22,
23. It is recorded that there was much more zeal in that noble woman the
Shunamite, mentioned, 2. Kings 4. 8, 9. then was in her husband (and yet he a
good man too) It was she that took that care for the Prophets entertainment:
it was she that would needs go to the Prophet upon a day, that was neither
Sabbath, nor holy day, which her husband thought much of, verse 23. And in the
New Testament it is worthy to be observed; 1. That Christ after his
Resurrection showed himself first to sundry women, and made them his
messengers to the Apostles, Luke 24. 10. 2. That zeal and diligence, that
woman showed in hearing the Word, and all other parts of Gods service, more
then men, They were women that are noted to have been the special followers
of our Savior to hear him preach, Luke 8. 2. It was a woman that showed such
zeal to hear him, that (neglecting all other business) sat at his feet to
hear him; and to whom our Savior gave that testimony that she had chosen the
good part, which should not be taken away from her, Luke 10. 39. 42. They were
women that were wont in Philippi every Sabbath day to meet and pray together,
Acts 16. 13. 3. The kindness they showed in Ministering to Christ's necessities,
which is not reported of any man, Luke 8. 3. 4. The constancy, and courage
that they showed in following him, and showing their love to him even to his
Cross, when the Apostles themselves fled for fear, Luke 23. 27. and in their
care to embalme his body after he was dead, Luke 23. 55, 56. and 24. 1. 5. The
faith which was stronger in them then in any men we read of, Mat. 15. 28. Luke
24. 8, 9, 11.

Now this respect that the Lord has been pleased to have unto women in this
kind, how offensive it is to the natural man, you may perceive here by the
disposition of the Disciples themselves, which were more then natural men, and
by common experience also. For if women shall flock to the Tabernacle of God,
and show any zeal and diligence in frequenting his house; if any Shunamite
shall show her self kind in entertaining Gods Prophets, or Susanna in
ministering to their necessities: what natural man is there almost that will
not be ready to slander, and misconstrue this? Yea, to account it a most
ridiculous thing, and argument of the weakness and foolishness of our
Religion.

The Reasons of this Doctrine are three: whereof;

The first concerns the Lord. The Reason why he uses to pass by the Reas. 1.
more worthy persons, and to show such grace to the more unworthy, is, the
respect that he has to his own glory. For whereas we are apt to think thus,
O if Nobles, and men of degree, and credit, were religious, and zealous, what
good might they do? What honor might they gain to God? In very deed, it is
nothing so; God receives more honor by calling these mean persons, then he
should do, if he called the other: That is the cause why our Savior gives
thanks for this: I thank thee o father Lord of heaven and earth, because thou
have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them unto
babes, Matthew. 11. 25. And rejoiced in Spirit at this: Luke 10. 21. Gods power,
and mighty hand is best discerned therein: my strength is made perfect in
weakness, says he, 2. Cor. 12. 9. And the freeness of his grace, and the
glory of man's salvation, is by this means wholly ascribed unto God, which
otherwise it would not be, and this reason the Apostle gives of the Lords
dealing thus in this case that no flesh should glory in his presence, 1. Cor.
1. 29.

The second concerns the persons that take this offense. For all natural men
are proud, and think best of themselves, and do envy, that any other should
be in better state then themselves, specially such as they judge to be their
inferiors, Do you think that the Scripture says in vain, the spirit that
dwells in us, lusts unto envy? James 4. 5. And above all, that any should be
thought to serve God better, or to be more in Gods favor then themselves. This
is the chief cause of the hatred that the wicked have borne to the godly in
all ages, Wherefore did Caine hate and slay Abel? because his own works were
evil and his brothers righteous, says the Apostle, 1. John 3. 12. Because
Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice (and more acceptable to God)
then Cain did, Heb. 11. 4.

The third concerns the persons themselves, against whom this offense 3.
is taken. For there is never a one of these four sorts, whom the Lord is wont
to have most respect to in this case, but they have (for the most part) such
infirmities, and faults in them, as cannot choose but give some occasion to the
natural man to think that it is no credit at all to Gods truth to be
professed by such.

1. The multitude, and common sort of people are for the most part void of
judgment, carried by affection, rather then by good reason, easily lead this
way, or that, unconstant, and unstable, this is plain in the example of that
people, that flocked after Christ; A little before his apprehension they
honored him exceedingly, a very great multitude spread their garments in his
way as he was riding toward Jerusalem, and cried Hosanna unto him, Matthew. 21*
8, 9. And when he was come thither, all the people were wont to come into the
Temple early in the morning to hear him, and that daily also, Luke 21. 37, 38.
yea they were wont all of them at that time to hear him with that attention
and affection that they are said even to have hanged on him, Luke 19. 48. But
so soon as they saw how he was apprehended, and vilifyed by the chief Priests
and Rulers, the same men that had honored him so much a little before, and
seemed to take so much delight and comfort in his doctrine, did all with one
consent cry, let him be crucified, let him be crucified; yea they preferred
Barabbas a murderer before him, and said, His blood be upon us and upon our
children, Matthew. 27. 22, 23, 25.

2. Young men for the most part are 1. Proud, and highly conceited of
themselves: that made the Apostle to say, 1. Tim. 3. 6. A Minister must not be
a nouice least being lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the
devil. 2. Rash, and void of judgment, as appears by the example of Rehoboam
himself and his young Counselors, 1. King. 12. 8. 10. I discerned among the
youth a young man void of understanding, Pro. 7. 7. 3. Inconstant; which made
the Apostle to exhort Timothy, 1. Tim. 4. 16. To take heed to himself, and to
the Doctrine, and to continue in them. And the experience the World has of
many that in their youth were zealous, and afterward have grown cold, and
worldly, makes them to think all will do so.

3. Such as having been of scandalous, and lewd life, grow to be professors,
seldom prove sound, and constant, Can the Ethiopian change his skin? or the
Leopard his spot^? then may ye also do good that are accustomed to do evil,
Ier. 13. 23. This is the reason of that speech, 1. Tim. 3. 7. He must have a
good report of them that are without; For Satan will be busier with such, then
with any other, Matthew. 12. 44. he says, I will return unto my house, frow
whence I came out.

4. Women are 1. Weaker in judgment then men, and more subject to passion, 1.
Pet. 3. 7. The weaker vessel. That is the cause why Satan assaulted Eve,
rather then Adam, Genesis 3. 1. they are more easily deceived, and corrupted then
men. 2. The Scripture to the disgrace, and humbling of them, ascribes the sin,
and corruption of mankind to that sex, rather then to the other, Adam was not
deceived, but the Woman being deceived was in the transgression. 1. Tim. 2. 14.
What is he which is borne of a woman that he should be righteous, Job 15. 14.
How can he be clean that was borne of a woman, Job 25. 4. In sin did my mother
conceive me, Psalm. 51. 4, 5. In which respect under the Law she was accounted
unclean, and enjoined a time of separation from the Sanctuary, after she had
brought forth a child, and that time also was to be double as much when she had
borne a female, as when a male, Leuit. 12. 4, 5. And that curse of God
threatened, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception, In sorrow
shall thou bring forth children, Genesis 3. 16. remains upon that sex, as a
real demonstration of this. 3. Experience shows that where they are wicked,
they are far worse then men; for cunning, and hypocrisy, for uncleanness,
and beastliness, for cruelty, and hard-heartednesse, for profaneness, and
impiety. Iesabel was worse then Ahab: Herodias then Herod: And Solomon speaks
this from experience, Eccles. 7. 28. One man among a thousand have I found, but
a woman among all those have I not found.

For to exhort all men to take heed they stumble not, nor take offense, at Use
1.
the baseness, or unworthiness of any person whom the Lord has called: Take
heed that ye despise not one of these little ones, Matthew. 18. 10. Despise not
any Professor for their sex, poverty, age, or former lewdness: but labor to
be of the same mind that was in Christ himself: rejoice in that wisdom and
goodness of God that appears in this, as he did, Matthew. 11. 25. Luke 10. 21.
This is a necessary caveat: for he is a happy man, that does not like the worse
of Religion for this: or that does not go the more unwillingly, vncheerefully,
and heavily in the way that leads to life, because he shall have no better
company in that way: that made our Savior say, Matthew. 11. 5, 6. the poor have
the Gospel preached unto them, and Blessed is he that shall not be offended
in me. If many were demanded the cause of their dislike, or coldness in
Religion, they would be as ready to give this as any, even the conception they
take to the persons of them that profess it.

Three good remedies I will give you against this corruption. 1. Consider thy
own self well, and thou shall find more cause to esteem basely of thy
self, then of any professor thou know, and to wonder more that God should
have such respect to thee, then to wonder at his mercy to any other. If these
Disciples had done so, they would never have repined, or wondered to see their
Master confer with this poor woman. This remedy the Apostle prescribes Tit.
3. 2. 3. showing al meeknes to al men for we our selves also were sometimes
foolish. 2. Consider it is Gods doing, whom then art thou angry at, when thou
repinest at this, Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?
Is thine eye evil because I am good? Matthew. 20. 15. 3. Consider for what end
the Lord has taken this course, God has chosen the foolish things of this
world to confound the wise, 1. Cor. 1. 27. This will one day confound many men,
that they have seen many women so zealous, full of knowledge, and grace; and
yet themselves have continued so void of all grace. The like may be said of
great men, of ancient men, of such as have lived ciuilly: that they have seen
so much knowledge, and grace, in the meanest sort of people, in young ones, in
men that have been formerly notorious sinners, and yet themselves remain so
void of all grace.

To exhort all professors of the truth; that forasmuch as the natural man
(...)
takes such occasion to mislike Gods truth, for the exceptions he is wont to
take against the persons of them that profess it: that they would therefore be
careful to remove (so far as in them lies) this stumbling block out of
their way. To this end there must be great care.

1. In the ordinary sort of professors, that they be 1 painful in their
callings: and even redeem the time they spend in frequenting holy exercises by
rising the sooner, going to bed the later, abating somewhat in their diet, and
apparel, to prevent decay in their estate. This the Apostle prescribes unto
all the faithful as a mean to prevent scandal, and to gain credit to the
Gospel, When we were with you this we commanded you, that if any would not
work neither should he eat. For we hear that there are some which walk among
you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies, 2. These. 3. 10. 12. 2
Just in all their dealings with men, showing all good fidelity, that they may
adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things, Tit. 2. 10. 3 Obedient,
and dutiful to all such as God has placed over them, Submit your selves to
every ordinance of men for the Lords sake; For so is the will of God, that with
well doing, ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men, 1. Pet. 2. 13.
15.

2. In such as are young, that they be 1 Humble, not selfe-conceited, Elihu had
waited till Job had spoken; because they were elder then he, Job 32. 4. and
verse 6. I am young, and ye are very old, wherefore I was afraid and durst not
show you mine opinion. 2 Stayed, and well grounded in judgment, Exhort young
men to be sober-minded, Tit. 2. 6. and because Titus was a young man himself,
he charge him to show himself a pattern unto his people (as in other
things, so) in gravity, in sound speech and doctrine that cannot be condemned,
Titus 2. 7, 8.

3. In such as have been men of a scandalous life, before they undertook the
profession of the truth; that they be 1 Humble, as the Apostle did (out of that
respect) show himself to be, 1. Cor. 15. 9. 2 Careful to take heed of
relapse, forasmuch as Satan will be busy with them, as we heard even now, out
of Matthew. 12. 44. 3 Such as shun all appearance of their former sin, and
strive so much the more carefully to gain credit to the Gospel, by the
fruitfulness of their life hereafter. As Zacheus who had in the former course
of his life offended by oppression and extortion, professes after his
conversion, Behold Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I
have taken any thing from any man, by false accusation, I restore him
fourefold, Luke 19. 8.

4. In women: that they be 1 Modest and sober, Let women adorn themselves in
modest apparel with shamefastness and sobriety, 1. Tim. 2. 9. 2 Meek and
quiet, Let women's adorning be, the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which
is in the sight of God of great price, 1. Pet. 3. 4. 3 Merciful, and given to
good works, as Dorcas is commended to have been, Acts 9. 39. 4 Obedient and
subject to their husbands, as the Apostle inioynes them, Tit. 2. 5.

Lecture the eight and fortieth, April 3. 1610. JOHN IIII. XXVII.
IT follows now, that we come to the second point that is observed concerning
them: namely, that though they did marvel at it, and inwardly dislike it, yet
none of them said unto him, why do thou so? what ask thou? or why talkest
thou with her?

Now, before we can receive our instruction from hence, it is fit that we
inquire, what it was that stayed them from speaking to him at this time
Considering that at other times when they had any doubt, they were wont boldly
to speak unto him, and to ask him any thing.

1. When he had taught any Doctrine publicly that they could not well
understand, their manner was, first to confer among themselves of it, but if
they could not receive satisfaction that way, they were wont always when they
had him alone, to go and move their questions unto him. A notable example for
all hearers. 1. Pass not over carelessely what you hear, and understand not,
but seek to know the meaning of it, and to be resolved. 2. Confer among your
selves. 3. If you cannot so be resolved, go to the Minister, your teacher. 4.
If that will not serve, go to Christ by prayer, When they had heard him (by
occasion) speak of the Resurrection from the dead, first they demanded one of
another what the rising from the dead should mean: and because (though they
received some light that way yet) there was one doubt they were not able to
resolve one another in, they went to him, and asked him that question: Mark. 9.
10, 11.

2. And this was so usual a course with them, that when our Savior saw them
conferring, and questioning among themselves about somewhat that he had taught
touching his Ascension, it is said, that he knew they would ask him, and
therefore he prevented them, and told them vn-asked, Ioh. 16. 19. When he had
taught the parable of the sower, they (when he was alone) asked him the meaning
of it, Mar. 4. 10. So when (teaching against the Jewish purifications) he had
said, that that enters into a man defiles him not, but that that comes from
within him, when he came into the house away from the people, they asked him
the meaning of it, Mark 7. 17. So when he had taught the Doctrine of divorce
very plainly, yet when he came into the house, they asked him again of the
matter, they would needs have a repetition of that Doctrine, Mar. 10. 10.

3. He had made himself so familiar to them that way, that they were bold to
make all their doubts known unto him, though in some of them, they could not
do it without incurring just blame for their shameful ignorance and
infidelity. When they saw the man that was borne blind, they ask him a
strange question, Ioh, 9. 3. Was it this man's sin or his parents that was the
cause? When they saw he had cast Satan out of one that had been possessed
from his childhood, Mark 9. 28. When he was come into the house, his Disciples
asked him secretly, why they could not cast him out. Such questions they durst
never have moved, if they had not been very familiar with him. But indeed
(though he were their Lord and Master, and took it upon him, and knew how to
maintain his honor in their hearts well enough, John 13. 13. Ye call me
Master and Lord, and ye say well, for so I am, yet) did he give them great
encouragement, and made them very bold with him that way. One notable example
more I will give you for this, John 16. 5. Now I go my way to him that sent
me, and none of you ask me whither go thou. 1. He blames them for not
asking him. 2. Yet they had asked him that very question before. Peter, John
13. 36. And Thomas, John 14. 5. Lord we know not whither thou go. But his
meaning is, they had not asked him often enough of that matter. Whereas friends
are wont to move many questions to a friend that is going from them, into a
far country, they were so overcome with grief by hearing of his departure,
that they were too mute, and moved not half questions enough to him about
that matter. A notable pattern for every faithful Minister of Christ not to
show himself stately, or austere, or churlish, or strange to any of his
hearers, that shall be willing to make use of him that way.

This being so, that at other times, and in other cases, they were so ready to
ask him any thing they doubted of, how falls it out that at this time though
they marvelled at it, yet no man asked him why he talked with this woman? Might
not this have been as profitable a question as many other, that they
propounded to him? Surely they knew they had offended, in entertaining in their
minds the least dislike of that that Christ did, or doubt of the lawfulness or
fitness of it: and they knew that by uttering their dislike they should have
offended in a further degree: and therefore they durst not do it: though they
had offended in thinking irreuerently, and undutifully, yet they durst not
speak. And why durst they not do it? What restrained them from uttering that
which they had conceived in their minds? Surely the reverence they bare to his
person: because they knew him to be the Son of God, the fear of God restrained
them.

Here then we have to observe, two notable effects and fruits of the true fear
of God.

1. General; it restraines the corruption of the heart, and keeps it under.

2. In special it restraines a man from calling into question, or speaking
irreuerently of any of the words, or works of God.

The first Doctrine then is this:

That it is an increase, and a further degree of sin, and a worse sign of a
graceless man, to speak then to think evil. Doct. 3.


True it is, that every man must make conscience of his thoughts, Keep thy
heart with all diligence, Pro. 4. 23. For 1. Men may be condemned for their
thoughts: The thoughts of the wicked are abomination to the Lord, Pro. 15. 26.
2. No man can make conscience of his words or works, that makes no conscience
of his thoughts, Matthew. 12. 34. How can ye being evil speak good things?
Ier. 4. 14. Oh Jerusalem wash thy heart from wickedness that thou may be
saved: how long shall vain thoughts lodge within thee? 3. Good men that
obtain strength from God to restrain the outward man, yet are vexed and
humbled much for the evil thoughts they are subject to.

But yet evil words and actions are worse then evil thoughts: and it is an
increase, and a further degree of sin, a greater sign of a graceless heart
to speak then to think evil. Certain it is, there is a latitude in sin,
there are degrees in it. Four degrees are mentioned, James 1. 14, 15. 1. The
motion and suggestion unto sin, which proceeds from our own lusts and
concupiscence. 2. The consent that is given unto that evil motion, when a man
is drawn away by it and entised, finding a kind of pleasure and contentment
in it, which the Apostle calls the conception of sin. 3. The committing of it
actually, which he calls the bringing forth and birth of sin. 4. The getting of
a habit by continuing and persisting in it, which he calls the finishing of
sin. While sin is in the thought, it keeps it self within the two first
degrees, Pro. 30. 32. If thou have been foolish in lifting thy self up, (viz.
in choler or desire of revenge, verse 34.) and if thou have thought wickedly,
lay thine hand upon thy mouth. So is it spoken of Esaias 59. ^3. We have spoken
cruelty and oppression, conceiving and uttering out of the heart false
matters. This is noted for a high degree of sin in great men, Micah 7. 3. The
great man speaks out of the corruption of his soul. They tempted God in
their hearts, by asking meat for their lust. Yea they spoke against God, they
said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness, Psalm. 78. 18, 19.

Reasons of the Doctrine, why it must needs be a great increase of sin, and
worse sign of a graceless man, when the corruption of the heart breaks out
into word^ action, are chiefly these two.

First it argues, that sin has got a more full dominion and sovereignty
Reas. 1.
over a man (is riper and perfecter) when it commands the body and outward man,
then when it rests within the heart. There is no man can possibly free his
heart from corruption in this life, Pro. 20. 9. Who can say I have made my
heart clean? No more can he his body neither, will you say. What man is free
from sin in word and deed, James 3. 2. yet this is far easier then the
other. Insomuch, as many a natural man may go far that way, Philip 36.
Concerning the righteousness which is in the Law, I was unrebukable. How much
more easily may the man that has grace? Therefore the Apostle does likewise
say, Romans 6. 12. Let not sin reign in your mortal body, sin reigns when
once it has gotten the command of the body.

When a man's corruption and sin breaks out into speech or action, it
dishonors God much more, and does more hurt to men, then Reas. 2.
the sin of the heart can do, 1. Cor. 15. 33. Evil speeches corrupt good
manners.

The Use of this Doctrine is:

1. To exhort every Christian to make trial of his estate in this one point.
The best man shall have much ado with the corrupt thoughts of his heart; Use 1.
but do thou strive against them? and have thou obtained that power over thy
self, that thou can keep them in, of conscience to God; this may give thee
exceeding comfort, Prou. 21. 23. He that keeps his mouth and tongue, keeps
his soul from troubles. The soundness of a regenerate heart, is seen in
nothing more, then in making conscience of our speech, Matthew. 12. 37. By thy
words thou shall be justified: and by thy words thou shall be condemned. See
two notable examples of this, one in Job, he glories much in this, Job 31. 30.
I have not suffered my mouth to sin, by wishing a curse etc. The other in
David, Psalm. 17. 3. Thou have tried me, and found nothing, for I was purposed,
that my mouth should not offend. And 39. 1. I said I will take heed to my
ways, that I sin not with my tongue, I will keep my mouth as with a bridle.
Yea he does also fervently pray for this, Psalm. 141. 3. Set a watch O Lord
before my mouth: keep the door of my lips.

2. To reprove the madness of profane men, that glory in this, that they are
no hypocrites: they mean no hurt, they have as good hearts as Use 2.
the best, though they speak merrily (for so they call all their scurrulous
and bawdy talk) and though they speak vainly and foolishly (for so they call
their swearing and blasphemy, Though they be such as have said and resolved
with themselves, as Psalm 12. 4. with our tongues we will prevail, our lips
are our own, who is Lord over us? But to these men I say, 1. It shall be
easier for the secret Hypocrite in the day of judgment then for thee: because
thou have dishonored God more, and done more hurt to men. Esaias 3. 9. Yea, they
declare their sins as Sodom they hide them not, woe be to their souls,
etc. 2. Whereas thou gloriest, thou meanest no hurt, thy heart is not so bad;
know thou there is much more filthiness, profaneness, and wickedness in thy
heart then comes forth at thy mouth. Matthew. 12. 34. For of the abundance of
the heart, the mouth speaks.

The second point to be observed is this, what it was that restrained them from
uttering that mislike that inwardly they had conceived, viz. the reverence that
they did bear unto his person whom they knew to be the Son of God, which
teaches us:

That there is that reverence and honor due to God, as we may not dare Doct. 4.
to make any doubt or question of his words or works, of any thing he says or
does, though we cannot conceive the reason of it.

That we mistake not this Doctrine, I will tell you how far forth we may make
question of Gods words and works.

1. We may enquire into Gods secrets so far forth as he has revealed them
in his Word: neither must men content themselves to be ignorant of any truth
that God has revealed in his Word under this pretense, that we may not be
inquisitiue into Gods secrets, the things revealed belong to us and to our
children, Deuteronomy. 29. 29. There is nothing revealed in the Word, but it concerns
us and our children to know, Romans 15. 4. Whatsoever is written, is written
for our learning.

2. We may examine, and make question of any Doctrine that is taught us by men,
be they never so good, so that we examine it not by our own reason, but by the
Scripture, Acts 17. 11. the Beraeans are commended for this.

3. If any thing we find in Scripture, and know to be Gods Word, seem to us
to be against sense and reason, it is not simply unlawful to make a question
of it, so we enquire only of God in humble desire to be taught, and examine
the matter by the Scripture, should not a people seek unto their God, to the
Law, and to the testimony, Esaias 8. 19, 20. The Papists cry out of our
infidelity and profaneness, because we will not rest in the plain Word, Matthew.
26. 26. This is my body. We enquire at God by the law and testimony, and find
that he has been wont in speaking of Sacraments to give to the sign the name
of the thing signified, and we do find also why he has done so. This kind of
making question even of that, that God has spoken, did never offend him, Luke
1. 34. the blessed Virgin did so.

4. It is not unlawful to enquire a reason of God works: so we seek it only
in the Scripture, David when he considered the manner of Gods government,
sought to know the reasons of it, but it was too painful, till he went into
the Sanctuary, Psalm. 73. 16, 17.

But yet for all this, this honor and obedience is due to God that we may not
make question of any thing he has said or done, to doubt of it, or dislike it,
because we cannot conceive the reason of it. We may not make our foolish reason
the judge, or the examiner of Gods Word, or works, we must admire and adore
that we cannot understand. Our thoughts and reason must be brought into
captivity, 2. Cor. 10. 5. For the Word of God, even such parts of it as our
thoughts and affections are most apt to rise against, See 2. notable examples.
The one in Eli, It is the Lord, let him do what seems him good, 1. Sam. 3.
18. The other in Hezekiah, good is the Word of the Lord which thou have spoken,
2. Kings 20. 19. For the works of God see this direction, and rule given us in
two of the strangest and most wonderful works of God, namely the reiection of
the nation of the Jews, and the reprobating of a great part of mankind in his
eternal counsel. Even concerning these here what the Apostle says, Romans
9. 20. Nay, but O man, who art thou that replyest against God? Shall the thing
formed, say to him that formed it, Why have thou made me thus? And 11. 33 --
35. O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how
unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out? For who has
known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor? Or, who has
first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? And generally
of all his works, Job 9. 12. Who will say unto him, what do thou? and 36.
23. Who has enjoined him his way? Or who can say, Thou have wrought iniquity?

Reasons of it.

1. The high estimation we ought to have of him in our minds, for his
excellency and greatness, He is the most high God possessour of heaven and
earth, Reas. 1.
Genesis 14. 22. This is is the ground of all piety, The fear of the Lord (this
high esteem of him in our hearts) is the beginning of wisdom, Psalm. 111. 10.
Now there is no man whom we honor indeed, and esteem reverently of, but we
will judge the best of his words and actions, Job 29. 24. If I laughed on them,
they believed it not. See an example of this toward an equal, Matthew. 1. 19.
Joseph (out of the reverent opinion he had of Mary) judged the best of that
which he could not conceive good reason for; and durst not make her a public
example and a rule for it toward all, Charity thinks no evil, 1. Cor. 13. 5.

2. His wisdom, justice and power, is so infinite and absolute, that it is
not possible he should err or do wrong, He is excellent in power, and
judgment, Reas. 2.
and in plenty of justice, Job 37. 23. His will is the rule of all
righteousness, the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to
whomsoever he will, Dan. 4. 32. He works all things after the counsel of
his own will, Ephesians. 1. 11.

3. The Lords manner has ever been to conceal from men, even from his best
servants oft-times his meaning and intent, in many of his works, Reas. 3.
Romans 11. 33. How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding
out? No man can fully understand his meaning in his word, that that we know, is
but a little, in comparison of that we are ignorant of, of all that God has
revealed to us touching his will, we may say with Eliphaz, Job 4. 12. mine ear
received a little thereof, and with the Apostle, 1. Cor. 13. 9. We know in
part, yea of his works also, with Job 26. 14. Lo, these are parts of his
ways, but how little a portion is heard of him? No not is his ordinary works
(howsoever Philosophers have bragged much of their skill that way) do men
perfectly understand the causes of them, and his manner of working in them, God
thundreth marueilously with his voice, great things does he which we cannot
comprehend, Job 37. 5. Much less in his extraordinary and immediate works of
justice or mercy. Yea, it is for Gods glory thus to do, It is the glory of God
to conceal a thing, Pro. 25. 2. And one chief cause of it, is our want of
capacity and ability to understand the Word and works of God. The good
Schoolmaster teaches his scholar, so much only as fits his capacity. It is
therefore a good rule for us to follow, which Elihu gives, Job 36. 24. 26.
Remember that thou magnify his work which men behold: every man may see it,
man may behold his work afar off. Behold God is great and we know him not,
neither can the number of his years be searched out.

The Use of this Doctrine is:

1. To Exhort every Christian to settle in his heart this reverend persuasion
Use 1.
of the Word, as to acknowledge and admire the truth, and holiness of it, even
in those things which he understands not, nor can conceive the reason of; and
to reject with detestation, all blasphemous thoughts that may rise within
himself, and all lewd persuasions that he may receive from others, to esteem
irreverently of any part of it. Take in this the Apostle for an example, who
having mentioned two objections which profane men are apt to make against the
truth, reiects them with detestation, and says God forbid, Romans 3. 6. and 6.
2. Till a man become thus simple, and have his thoughts thus captiuated, he
shall never attain to true wisdom, Gods Word gives Wisdom to the simple,
Psalm 19. 7. and if any man seems to be wise in this world, let him become
a fool that he may be wise, 1. Cor. 3. 18.

To Exhort us, in all Gods judgments and corrections upon us, to Use 2.
take heed of murmuring, or opening thy mouth against God. but do as Psalm
62. 5. My soul keep thou silence unto God. Take rather this course. 1. Seek
and enquire what is in thee: and what thou have done that has thus provoked
God, Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Lord, Lam. 3. 40. 2.
Though thou can find no notorious crime in thy self, or such as might
provoke him to so extraordinary a judgment, yet rest resolved, he cannot wrong
thee, though he should cast thee into hell; and therefore submit thy self in
all reverence, and seek peace with him, Whom, though I were righteous, yet
would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my Judge, Job 9. 15. 3. Be
assured, that if thou unfeignedly fear him, he intends thy good in this his
judgment, though thou cannot yet perceive it, Psalm. 25. 10. All the paths of
the Lord are mercy and truth: unto such as keep his Covenant, and his
testimonies.

THE NINE AND FORTIETH LECTVRE, ON APRIL, X. MDCX.
IOH. IIII. XXVIII, XXIX, XXX. The Woman therefore left her Water-pot, and went
her way into the City, and says unto the men:

Come see a man which told me all things that ever I did, is not this the
Christ?

Then they went out of the City, and came unto him.


WE have already heard the conference, that our Savior had with the Woman of
Samaria, and how it was interrupted and broken of, by the coming of the
Disciples. In these words is set down the notable effect and fruit that came
of it.

The parts of the Text are two.

1. The endeavor that this Woman used to draw her neighbors unto Christ,
verse 28, 29.

2. The success God gave to this her endeavor, verse 30.

Concerning her endeavor, three things are to be observed. 1. The zeal and
forwardness she used, in going to her neighbors, verse 28. 2. The motion and
persuasion she used, when she was come unto them: she desired no more of them,
but that they would come and see Christ. 3. The reasons she used to draw them
to this.

For the first, there be three things noted by the Evangelist, verse 28. that
do much commend the zeal and forwardness of this woman, in seeking to draw
her neighbors unto Christ. 1. That he says, The woman therefore (for so it is
in the original) went her way into the City. 2. That he says, she left her
water-pot, or payle behind her, for the word (...) signifies any vessel used
to carry water in. 3. That he says when she came into the City, she said unto
the men, Come see a man that has told me all things that ever I did.

The word therefore implies, that somewhat that is mentioned before, was the
cause of her so sudden and hasty departing from Christ, and running into the
City, and what was that? Surely if we look back into the two former verses,
we shall find two causes of it. 1. Because the Di^ciples were now come out of
the City with meat for him, and she thought he would be gone as soon as he had
eaten somewhat; therefore she made have to go, and call her neighbors, for
fear he should be gone, before they could come. 2. Because Christ had plainly
told her, he was the Messiah, therefore she went her way: Why? but that should
rather have stayed her still with him, and made her desirous of further speech.
No verily; for she did undoubtedly believe, that he was so indeed as he had
said, and her heart was so astonished with sudden joy, and earnest desire to
draw her neighbors to him, that she could neither speak, nor tarry any
longer, but away she goes into the City, and tells her neighbors.

But why did she leave her paile behind her? Surely though she came to the
Well, of purpose to fetch water, and she had need, and use of water, for some
work she had to do at home; yet the joy she found, in the knowledge of
Christ, and the zealous desire she had to win her neighbors; made her
careless both of the water, and of her paile also; and forgetful of the work
she had to do at home. 2. She left it for haste, because if she should have
taken it with her, and carried it home, she could not have gone with that
speed, to fetch her neighbors, as she thought it was needful she should do.
3. It is to be observed that the Evangelist says when she came into the City,
she said to these men (...), or (as the best translaters read it) to the men
of that place, that is, the neighbors among whom she lived, and all of them
without difference, she sought to draw them all unto Christ.

Having thus opened the meaning of this verse, let us now observe two points in
it for our instruction. 1. The zeal she had to run and fetch her neighbors.
2. The leaving of her paile behind her.

And first in that the Holy Ghost has here observed, that this Woman, so soon
as she knew and believed in Christ, was so zealous to draw her neighbors to
him, that for their sakes she was content to leave Christ, though no doubt she
desired much to continue with him; and to deprive her self of the comfort and
benefit, she might have found if she had tarryed longer with him. 2. And made
such have to fetch them for fear he should be gone, before she could bring
them. 3. And called them all, she says to the men, one as well as another,
without special respect to any, with neglect of others. 4. And thus she did,
being but a woman, a poor and simple woman.

We have this Doctrine to learn. That every one that truly knows Christ,
and finds comfort in him, will be careful and ready to draw others Doct. 1.
to him.

1. When they have found this comfort, they cannot choose but speak of it to
others, their hearts would burst if they should not speak of it, Gods grace is
like fire in their bones, as Ier. 20. 9. They cannot hide it: Though Christ had
charged the two blind men he cured, that they should say nothing of it, Matthew.
9. 30. Yet when they departed, they could not for their lives conceal it.

2. That which the Apostle requires, of all that have received the wealth of
this world, 1. Tim. 6. 19. that every one will do that has received the
heavenly riches of Gods grace, they will do good with it to others, they will
be ready to distribute and communicate it to others, Paul wished heartily that
both Agrippa and all that heard him were altogether such as he was, excepting
his bonds, Act. 26. 29. in this is grace not unlike to worldly wealth, no
usurer is forwarder so soon as money comes in, to put it out again, then
every true belieuer is to put out the grace that he has received, he that had
received the five talents went and traded with them, Matthew. 25. 16. See this in
sundry examples, Psalm. 51. 13. David says, he would teach Gods Ways to
others, they that feared the Lord spoke often one to another, Mal. 3. 16. So
soon as Christ had found Philip, Philip went and found out Nathaniel, John 1.
45. So soon as Matthew was converted, he gathered together a great company of
Publicans and others to meet at his house, Luke 5. 29.

The Reasons why it must needs be so, are many. 1. They know Reasons.
the Lord has straightly commanded and bound them, that no man should content
himself, to know, believe, repent, but seek also to cause others to do it,
Ezekiel. 18, 32. Cause therefore one another to return, and live ye, Luke 22,
32. When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren, 1. Pet. 4. 10. Let every
one as he has received a gift, minister the same one unto another, as good
disposers.

2. The love they bear to God, provoke them to do all they can to enlarge
his kingdom, Knowing the terror of the Lord, we persuade men, 2. Cor. 5. 11.
verse 14. and the love of Christ constrains us.

3. The love they bear to their neighbors. The first and chief work of
faith is love, faith works by love, Gal. 5. 6. And there is no love in him to
his neighbor, that loves not his soul, Thou shall not hate thy brother in
thy heart: thou shall in any wise rebuke thy neighbor, and not suffer sin
upon him, Leuit. 19. 17. Count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a
brother, 2 Thessalonians. 3. 15. If the conscience of the Lepers accused them for not
acquainting the City that was ready to be famished, with the victuals and
spoil the Assyrians had left behind them, 2. Kings 7. 9. how much more will
it do that in this case.

4. They know it is the best means to increase the grace they have. The more
they draw to knowledge and faith, the more will their own knowledge and faith
increase in them, I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual
gift; that I may be comforted together with you, Romans 1. 11, 12. As the casting
forth of your seed brings it you back again with great increase, 2 Cor. 9.
6. Because God knew Abraham would make good use of that he knew, for the
instruction of his family, therefore he would hide nothing from Abraham, Genesis
18. 19.

5. They know, no good work they can do, will have the like recompense of
reward, as this: the works of mercy men have done but to the bodies of others,
have often turned away Gods plagues from them, that otherwise would have fallen
on them for their sins, as appears by the counsel Daniel gives to
Nebuchadnezar, break off thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it
may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity, Dan. 4. 24. But a far greater
promise is made to him that has done this work of mercy to the souls of
others, James 5. 20. Let him know; he that has converted his brother, has
saved a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.

6. Lastly: this is the end God respects in bestowing his graces upon any,
not that they should keep them to themselves, but benefit others by them, Men
do not light a candle and put it under abushell, but on a candlestick, etc.
Mat. 5. 15. The manifestation of the spirit (that is, those gifts where it is
manifested that men have the spirit of God) is given to every man to profit
withal. God comfort us in all our tribulations, that we may be able to
comfort them which are in trouble, 2. Cor. 1. 4.

The Use of this Doctrine is first to exhort all men to approve the truth Use
1.
of their conversion by this, them specially whom God has given most means
unto, for the winning of others. And those are three sorts of men.

1. Such as are men of wealth and authority, as Magistrates, Landlords,
Richmen, for they might draw many to Christ, by their example, much more by
their persuasion, Acts 18. 8. When Crispus once believed, many of the
Corinthians believed also, and were baptized. And Pro. 19. 6. Many reverence
the face of the Prince, and every man is a friend to him that gives gifts. If
such would but say to them that depend upon them, I wish you well, and would
do you good, but I should love you better, and do more for you, if I saw more
Religion in you, and love to the Word, Oh what good might they do! And because
they do it not, but the contrary, to them principally, will the destruction of
Gods people be imputed. So that now it may be said of all profaneness and
impiety in the land, Ezra 9. 2. The hand of the Princes and Rulers is chief in
the trespass.

2. Such as are kinsmen and men of special acquaintance, that have many
friends, are most bound to this duty, 1. Tim. 5. 4. Let them learn first to
show godliness toward their own house, and to recompense their kindred, for
that is an honest thing, and acceptable before God. It is said of Andrew, that
so soon as he knew Christ, he went first and found out his brother Simon, John
(...) 41. And Cornelius, against Peter should come, had called together his
kinsmen and special friends, Acts 10. 24.

3. Such as are Masters of families, husbands, parents, are more bound then
others to this duty. For they may prevail greatly, if the fault be not in
themselves: therefore it is so often spoken of good men, that when they received
the faith, all their family became religious, John 4. 53. Acts 18. 8. and 10.
16. and 15. 33. Indeed this is not always so, but if there had not been very
much in this, surely the Holy Ghost would not have given so many examples of
it. Therefore is Joshua so confident, Josh. 24. ^5. As for me, and my house,
we will serve the Lord. He would undertake for them.

2. Since all are bound to this duty, and the more we can gain to God, the Use
2.
greater shall our comfort be, let every Christian be exhorted to fit, and
enable himself to do it. Four things there be that will make a man fit to
win others to the love of Religion. 1. He must have knowledge and be able to
convince them, that they are out of the way, ye are filled with all knowledge
able to admonish one another, Romans 15. 14. 2. He must himself be fully
persuaded that it is necessary all men be religious and live under a true
ministry, and that they are in a miserable estate that live otherwise: and have
an inward compassion of them, we also believe and therefore speak, 2. Cor. 4.
13. Christ's bowels yearned in him for the people that were as sheep without a
shepherd, and therefore showed such desire they might have more teachers,
Matthew. 9. 36. 38. 3. He must resolve to meet with many discouragements, if he
will undertake this, as Lot did in admonishing the Sodomites, and even of his
own sons in law, Genesis 19. 9. 14. and arm himself with patience to endure
them. Without this resolution and patience, no man shall be able to do any
good service to God. Be strong and of a good courage, Josh. 1. 6. and again,
verse 7. only be thou strong and very courageous that thou may observe to
do according to all the Law which Moses my servant commanded thee. Specially
in this kind, 1 Thessalonians. 5, 14. Be patient toward all men. Thou must consider,
1. That though thy endeauours have not prevailed hitherto, yet they may
hereafter, they may glorify God for thee in the day of their visitation, 1.
Pet. 2. 12. 2. That though they do not prevail at all, yet shall thy comfort
and reward be nevertheless, though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be
glorious in the eyes of the Lord, Esaias 49. 5. 4. He must live so, as he may
gain credit to his profession by his holy life: it is the honest conversation
of Christians and the good works that will win natural men, and cause them to
glorify God for them in the day of their visitation, 1. Pet. 2. 12. Whereas on
the contrary it may be said of many professors, as Genesis 34. 20. They make all
of their profession, to stink amongst the inhabitants of the land.

The third Use is for reproof; for what conscience most men make of this duty,
we may discern it if we look but on their children and servants. Use 3.
Nay, many even of them also that would be counted professors, some
neighbors, some parents, yea some Ministers fret at nothing more, then at the
forwardness of such as they should have drawn to Christ, and discourage them
all they can. I will say no more to such, but wish them to remember what a
curse Nehemiah in the Spirit of Prophecy, wished to Sanballat, and Tobia, for
discouraging Gods people by taunts, etc. Nehem. 4. 5.

I know many parents will say, that they send their family to the Ministers to
be instructed, and it is he that has charge of all the souls in his Parish;
and wherefore else do we pay him our tithes? But to them I say, 1. The most of
you will not see that they come to the Minister; nor can endure he should be
over busy with them this way. 2. Thou should be an help to thy Minister
this way, his burden is too great if thou help not, Phil. 1. Philemon was
Paul's fellow laborer. 3. Thou art as straightly charged with thine own family;
as he is with the Congregation, and so much the more as thou have more means
to prevail with them then the other. 4. It is the speech of a Cain, Genesis 4. 9.
Am I my brothers keeper?

Lecture the fiftieth, April 17. 1610. JOHN IIII. XXVIII.
IT follows now that we come to the second point, wherein this Woman showed
her zeal, viz. in leaving her payle behind her. And that we may ground our
instruction well from this example: observe in it these points. 1. She came for
water, and therefore sure had need and use of water for some businesses she had
to do at home: 2. Yet, she leaves both her water and her payle, and the
business she had to do at home: 3. Why did she so? Surely her heart was so
taken up with joy that she knew Christ, and with zealous desire to make him
known to her neighbors, that she came careless and forgetful both of her
water and of her payle, and worldly business:

2. Though it was not unlawful for her after she knew Christ, to follow her
worldly business, yet she knew by doing it at this time she should have
sinned, because she should have neglected a greater duty then the carrying
home of her water, or doing other of her worldly business; she feared that she
could not have brought her neighbors soon enough to Christ, if she had gone
home with her water, and therefore she had rather neglect both her water and
her payle, and the business she had to do at home, then to neglect a work of
far greater importance, even the drawing of her neighbors to Christ.

The Doctrine then that we have to learn from this example, is this: That the
man that knows Christ aright, and is truly converted, cares less for
worldly things then he did before.

Before we confirm this Doctrine, to prevent the mistaking of it, two things
must be observed.

1. She was not bound now she had found Christ, and knew him to her comfort,
to forsake the world quite, and give over her worldly business. There is no
opposition between these things, so as it should be necessary for all that
desire to serve God, and seek his kingdom, to give over their worldly
callings, neither is this the way to perfection, as Papists have dreamed. No
man has warrant to spend his whole time in private devotion, upon pretense
that he will forsake the world. Indeed the Minister should say as the Apostles
do, Acts 6. 4. We will give our selves continually to prayer, and to the
ministration of the Word. But no other Christian need say so, but rather
should seek to live in such a calling, as wherein he may have somewhat else to
employ himself in, for the profit of others, Ezekiel. 18. 18. Because he has not
done good among his people he shall dye in his iniquity. Christ uses not to
draw men from their callings, but such only as he chooses to be his
Ministers, when the man that was dispossessed would have continued with him, he
sent him away, saying, return to thine own house, Luke 8. 38, 39. The true
cause why most men and women, by following their worldly business, loose all
grace, and become so earthly minded, is not in their worldly callings, but in
themselves and their own corruption. There have been Christians that have had
great dealings in the world, yet daily served God, and received thereby no
decay of grace, for in them they served the Lord Christ, Colos. 3. 24. Let
Joseph be an example for men in this case; he had great dealings in the world,
both while he was in Potiphars house, and specially afterward, yet continued he
a very religious and holy man. And for women, Let her be an example that is
mentioned, Pro. 31. A better huswife cannot be found, verse 13. 15. 27. Yet her
chief praise is this, that she was a woman very religious, verse 30. And
therefore the Apostle speaks to a Christian servant, having an Infidel to
his master, whose condition in that respect was hardest of all other, 1. Cor.
7. 21. Art thou called being a servant care not for it.

2. She was not bound, now she knew Christ to her comfort to cast away her
payle, now she had found this treasure, to cast away her worldly goods. Nay
Religion binds a man to be a good husband, to seek to preserve and increase
also that estate that God has given him. The eighth commandment, that binds
a man not to impair, but to increase, so far as in him lies the good estate
of his neighbor, binds him much more to have a care of his own estate. It
is not lawful for a man to be careless of his estate, no not upon pretense of
charity or mercifulness to the poor, as is plain by that strait charge that
is so often given us to take heed how we become sureties for another man, Pro.
11. 15. and 20. 18 and 22. 26. yea even in releeuing the Saints, we must have
respect to our ability, Acts 11. 29. The goods that any man has are not his
own, but they are Gods gifts; the silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says
the Lord of hoasts. Hag. 2. 9. and he is but the steward of them, and shall be
called to account how he has used them, My meat also which I gave thee, fine
flower, oil, and honey wherewith I sed thee, thou have even set it before them
for a sweet savor. Ezekiel. 16. 19. And therefore to cast any of them away, even
the least bit of bread (oh that our gamesters and drunkards, and Prodigals
could believe this) is a sin against God. And that is the reason of that law,
Deuteronomy. 20. 19. Thou shall not destroy the trees, for thou may eat of them;
and of that commandment of our Savior, Ioh. 6. 12. Gather up the fragments
that remain that nothing be lost. These two points being thus premised, let
us now proceed to the confirmation of the Doctrine.

This is a certain fruit, and sure note of a true Convert; he makes not that
account of worldly things as he did before. But as the love of worldly riches,
when it once seizes upon any heart, it presently decays grace in it, and
draws it away from the love of heavenly things, Matthew. 13. 22. The cares of
this world, and the deceitfulness of riches choke the Word, and makes it
unfruitful. So on the other side, when once God has given a man a true taste
and love of heavenly things, he shall grow to adistaste and light regard of
worldly comforts. Yea according to the measure of a man's inward love and joy he
takes in heavenly things, shall his neglect and contempt of the world be in
him. The expectation and desire Abraham had of heaven, made him willing to
leave his own country, and to continue out of it all his time. The Church is
said, Apoc. 12. 1. To have the moon under her feet, that is, all worldly
things which like the Moon, are subject to continual change.

The power that Gods grace has this way, may be observed in three points.

1. It makes a man willing to part with whatsoever is dearest to him in the
world, if he cannot hold it with Gods favor. That is a treasure for which a
man will be content to sell all that ever he has, Matthew. 13. 44. to loose all
things, and to count them but dung in comparison of it, Phil. 3. 8. This made
all Gods people in Israel to leave their dwellings and possessions there, and
to come to Jerusalem where God was purely worshipped, 2. Chron. 11. 16. This
made Moses willing to forgo all his honors, and pleasures, and hopes he had
in Pharaoh^ Court, and to join himself unto Gods afflicted and despised
Church, Heb. 11. 24. 25.

2. It moderateth the affection of a man to earthly things, and teaches him to
use them with more sobriety and indifferency; so as he does neither so greedily
desire them, nor is so discontented in the want of them, nor so lifted up in
the abundance of them, as others be, it makes him able to say with the Apostle,
I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content. I know, both
how to be abased, and I know how to abound; every where and in all things I am
instructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer
need, Phil. 4. 11, 12. He uses them as the traveler does his good lodging he
finds in his Inn, for his necessity, and the better enabling him to go
forward in his journey homeward, but sets not his heart upon them, Psalm. 62.
10. And thus he professes that he is but a stranger and pilgrim upon earth,
and seeks for another country, Heb. 11. 13, 14.

3. It so takes up a man's heart (specially in his first conversion, in his
first love) as it makes him very careless and forgetful of all things else.
As Peter and Andrew, James and John straitway left their ships, their net, and
their father, and followed Christ, Matthew. 4. 20. 22. This made Christ's hearers
Mar. 8. 2. so careless of their meat for three days together, and Mary to
neglect her hu^wifry, in the entertaining of Christ, and leaving all to sit her
down at Christ's feet, to hear his words, Luke 10. 39.

The Reason of this Doctrine is this, that they have found another treasure,
and where the treasure is, there will the heart be, Matthew. 6. 21. He Reason.
that once counts Religion his treasure, cannot set his heart on the world;
the heart can no more be divided between them, then it is possible for a man
at the same time to look with one of his eyes toward heaven, and with another
upon the ground. These two things, the love of the world, and the love of God,
are of a masterfull disposition. Into what heart soever they enter, they will
be commanders, and rule alone, which is the reason of that speech of our
Savior, Matthew. 6. 24. No man serves two masters.

1. To instruct us what to judge of such Christians, as use not only on the
Sabbath day, but on the week days also to go to Sermons and Exercises Use 1.
of Religion; worldly men think of these men, that they do more then they
need, yea, more then they ought to do, that this will bring them to beggary.
Yea, many are afraid to be religious, or to frequent the Ministry of some men,
for fear least they should be drawn to do thus as they see many of their
hearers are. In handling this point I will show: 1. What is to be said for the
warning and admonition of these men. 2. What is to be said for the
encouragement and defense of them.

1. It is indeed a great sin in any professor to neglect his calling, upon
pretense of following Sermons, and serving God, specially if he have a charge,
and want other means to live by; and that many of the better sort of
Christians are too much inclined to this sin, appears by Paul's beating on
this point so much in his Epistles to the Thessalonians, Study to be quiet and
to do your own business, and to work with your own hands as we commanded
you, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 11. We hear that there are some which walk among you
disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies. Now them that are such,
we command, and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ that with quietness they
work, and eat their own bread, 2 Thessalonians. 3. 11, 12. but this is a great
sin. For 1. Every Christian should desire to live of himself, that he may
not be chargeable unto others, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 11, 12. When he had charged them to
follow their own business, and to work with their hands, he gives this for a
reason, that nothing may be lacking to them. 2. If a man have a family, and
provide not for it, he is worse then an Infidel; 1. Tim. 5. 8. Therefore Paul
says, 1. Cor. 7. 33. The married cares (and that lawfully) for the things of
the world. 3. Say a man could provide for himself and his family sufficiently,
yet he must also have a care to follow his calling, that he may have to give
others that need, Rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that
is good, that he may have to give to him that needs, Ephesians. 4. 28. And this
reason the Apostle gives why himself did at Ephesus with the labor of his
own hands minister unto his own necessities, and to them that were with him;
and why (according to his example) others in the like case of necessity and for
the avoiding of scandal should do the like; even the remembrance of the words
of the Lord Jesus, how he said it is a more blessed thing to give then to
receive, Act. 20. 24, 35. 4. Say a man have enough for all this, yet must he
have care of his estate, for this cause, because if he decay in it, he shall be
a scandal to his profession, and alienate others from the truth, Pro. 14. 20.
The poor is hated even of his own neighbor. Therefore Paul makes this one
reason for this, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 11, 12. Do your business and work with your
own hands, that ye may walk honestly to them that are without. 5. Say a man's
estate were so plentiful, that no decay could be discerned in it to the
scandal of his profession, yet is he bound to live and take pains in some
calling wherein he may be profitable to others, else can he have no true
comfort in any of Gods blessings that he does enjoy, for thus runs the
promise, Psalm ^28. 2. When thou eatest the labors of thy hands, thou shall
be blessed; and it shall be well with thee, 2. Thessalonians 3. 12. They
only eat their own bread, that labor in a calling.

2. It is to be granted that there is not the like necessity of frequenting the
public exercises of Religion on any other day as there is on the Sabbath, for
that, there is an express commandment, and on that even the poorest is bound
to keep an holy rest unto the Lord, for the commandment binds all men, and
none is exempted from it, Exodus 20. 10. which on the other days they are not.

3. It is not to be denied, but some Christians may and ought to spend more
time in the exercises of Religion then other some. Such as are of wealth and
ability to live of themselves, are more bound to frequent the public exercises
on the week day, then poorer men. Such as by their callings have more leisure
and freedom from worldly employment, then such as have more necessary and
important business. Of rich men it may be said, There is a price put into
their hands to get wisdom, Pro. 17. 16. That makes the Apostle speak as he
does of the privilege that the single person has above the married, the
unmarried man cares for the things that belong to the Lord how he may please
the Lord: The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may
be holy both in body and in spirit, 1. Cor. 7. 32, 34. and the widow also,
she that is a widow indeed and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in
supplications and prayers night and day, 1. Tim. 5. 5. Whereas verse 14. Other
women have other employments. Such a widow was Anna, Luke 2. 37. she departed
not from the Temple, but served God with fasting and prayer night and day.

Lecture the one and fiftieth, April 24. 1610. JOHN IIII. XXVIII, XXIX.
IT follows that we come now to show, what is to be said for the defense and
encouragement of those men, that not contenting themselves to serve God upon
the Sabbath, do upon the week days, leave their worldly business, and spend
much time in Gods worship. And that I will deliver (for the better help of
your memory and mine own) in five principal and chief points.

1. Every Christian is bound to serve God not upon the Sabbath only, but to
spend some part of every day in Gods worship. This was signified in the Law: 1.
When God commanded there should be a morning and evening sacrifice offered
every day, Exodus 29. 39.

And the King is commanded (notwithstanding all his weighty employments) to
read some part of Gods Word every day, Deuteronomy. 17. 19. and that we should pray
every day, it is evident by the fourth petition of the Lords pray. Therefore we
read that Gods servants did set themselves certain times for prayer every
day, and observed them precisely, Psalm 55. 17. Dan. 6. 16. and yet both these
were men that had much business. Reasons for this are these: 1. Though the
Sabbath in a special sort be called the Lords day, yet is every day his too,
Psalm. 74. 16. Therefore as the Apostle proves, we must glorify and serve God
with our bodies as well as our souls, because they are both his, 1. Cor. 6.
20. so may we prove that God is to be served every day, as well as on the
Sabbath day, because every day is his.

2. If we do not by this means every day stir up, quicken, and nourish Gods
grace in our selves. The deceitfulness of sin and Satan, and worldly
occasions will by little and little harden us, and steal away our hearts from
God, security will creep upon us before we be aware, Heb. 3. ^3. And the more
dealings a man has in the world, the greater cause he has to fear this. That
is the reason that is given, why the Lord will have the King to read every day,
Deuteronomy. 17. 20. That his heart be not lasted up, and that he turn not from the
commandment.

3. The little time spent in Gods service every day, will bring Gods blessing
upon the whole day; and upon the business and occasions of that day. As the
first fruits that Gods people gave to him, brought his blessing upon all the
rest, Deuteronomy. 26. 10, 11. It is that, that gives us a sanctified use of the day,
and of all the comforts of it; of our own labors, and of the labors of our
servants, 1. Tim. 4. 5. So that when a man shall remember how many hours in
every day he has spent, in sleeping, eating, drinking, and sporting; and how
few hours, yea minutes of the day, he has bestowed on the Lord, and on his
own soul, he shall have cause to complain, as Job 7. 6. My days are swifter
then a Weauers shuttle, and are spent without hope.

2. It is lawful to have public assemblies, to keep Lectures and Exercises,
not on the Sabbaths only, but on other days also; and for Gods people to
frequent them. This is evident in the practice and example of the Primitive
Church, and of our Savior himself. It is spoken to the praise of Gods people
in the Primitive Church, that they continued daily with one accord in the
Temple, Acts 2. 46. And Luke 19. 47, Christ taught daily in the Temple and had
a great audience, verse 48. All the people hanged on him, and 21. 37, 38. In
the day time he taught in the Temple, and at night he went out to the mount of
Olives; and in the morning all the people came to hear him in the Temple, Mar.
8. 13. We read, that a very great multitude had followed him, and continued
with him three days; and some of them came from far; so that besides those
three days, they spent some good time, in coming to him, and going back. If
it had not been lawful to keep Lectures and exercises upon week days,
doubtless he would not so usually and often have preached on those days, and
if it had not been lawful for Gods people of all sorts to frequent them,
surely he would not have suffered them to do it, he would have reproved them
for it. So that he that shall reprove or deride, or blame Gods people for
this; out of doubt he has not the spirit of Christ in him.

3. Though no man be so expressly and particularly commanded to go to Sermons
on the week day, as on the Sabbath; yet all that are able to do it, whose
necessities will permit them, are as well bound to go to Sermons on the week
day, as on the Sabbath. God requires more service, of every man then he has
expressly and particularly commanded. Besides the sacrifices that God had
expressly commanded, there were free offerings under the Law; which men of their
own voluntary will did bring unto God, Leuit. 1. 3. and 7. 16. None were
expressly commanded, to go up to Jerusalem at the three feasts, but only the
males, Exodus 34. 23. nor among the males any that were under 20. years of age
(for such only were wont to be numbered, Exodus 30. 4) and yet we find that
Elkanah was wont to take with him all his family, his wives, his sons and
daughters every year to those feasts, 1. Sam. 1. 4. 21. So did the blessed
Virgin, every year keep the Passover at Jerusalem with her husband. And our
Savior himself when he was but twelve years old, was wont to go with them,
Luke 2. 41, 42.

If any shall object and say that God allows no will worship; but has Object.
straightly charged us in his worship and service, to follow precisely the
direction of his Word, Deuteronomy. 4. 2. Ye shall put nothing to the Word that I
command you, nor take ought therefrom, that ye may keep the commandments of
the Lord your God which I command you.

I answer, this was no will worship; neither did they in this more, then they
were bound to do; for 1. The service it self that they did to God, Answ.
was expressly and particularly commanded, and not of their own devising,
Leuit. 1. 3. A law was set down for voluntary offerings. They that would offer
of their own voluntary will are expressly limited what they should offer, and
where, and how. 2. Though there were no particular and express commandment;
for these persons to do this service; yet there was a general commandment
that bound them to do it, if their health and ability and necessary occasions
would permit them. There was a general commandment that bound them to do God
what service they were able to do, Thou shall love the Lord thy God with
allthine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might, Deuteronomy. 6. 5.
Which law our Savior gives for the sum of the first Table, Matthew. 22. 37.
The Lord did not expressly command them this service: 1. Because he would not be
burdensome unto them, women and children might have many just lets: 2. Because
he would try their love. The like we may say for the Sabbath, God has expressly
commanded us no more but one day in seven to rest from our labors, and spend
in his service, Exodus 20. 9, 10. 1. Because he would not have his service
burdensome unto us. 2. To try our love, and what we will do voluntarily; for
he takes great pleasure in a voluntary and free service, The children of
Israel brought a willing offering unto the Lord, every man and woman, whose
heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the Lord had
commanded to be made by the hands of Moses, Exodus 35. 29. Therefore David vowed
this to God, Psalm. 54. 6. I will sacrifice freely unto thee. He and the people
rejoiced, and found wonderful comfort in this, when they had offered
willingly, 1. Chron. 29. 9. While Anna gave suck, she knew, she was not bound
to go to the feast, she said to her husband, I will not go up, till the
child be weaned, 1. Sam. 1. 22. The journey was long, and she was to tarry
long there; but when she was free from that necessary let, she knew she was
bound to go every year, and she missed not. So that as they that can plead
just necessity to keep them from Sermons on the week day, shall be held
excused; so they that are not withheld by any such necessity, and use their
liberty as an occasion to the flesh, Galathians 5. 13. shall be judged void
of all love to God and his Word, if they never hear the Word but upon the
Sabbath. Take heed therefore of pretending necessity in this case; say not,
thou would go to the Sermon, but thou can not spare so much time. If thou
can spare every week as much time in the alehouse, or in some unnecessary
recreations, or can spare so much money as can be gotten in this time, in
sundry idle and unnecessary expenses, and can not spare so much to go to a
Sermon, thou art no better then an Hypocrite.

4. Even they whose necessity will not permit them to frequent the public
assemblies on the week day, yet are bound to nourish in themselves, a willing
mind to do it if they were able, they should be willing even above their
power, 2. Cor. (...). 3. They should desire that liberty that others enjoy this
way, in this case I may, that to every one which (in another case) the Apostle
says to the servant, if thou may be made free, use it rather, 1. Cor. 7.
21. and esteem it a just cause of grief to them, that they have not that
liberty to follow the means of their spiritual comfort as others have, we
should all strive to be so affected toward the Lords Tabernacle, as David was,
when he said, How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! My soul
longs, yea even faints for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh
cries out for the living God, Psalm 84. 1, 2. Every man is bound to esteem
it a great happiness to enjoy that liberty, that he may often resort to Gods
House, and to count that time of all other best spent, and most to his profit
and benefit that is spent in Gods service, Proverbs 8. 33, 34. Hear
instruction and be wise, and refuse it not: Blessed is the man that watches
daily at my gates, Psalm 27. 4. One thing have I desired of the Lord, that I
will seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my
life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his Temple, Luke 10
42. One thing is needful, Mary has chosen the better part which shall not be
taken away from her. Every man is bound to esteem this the true and proper end
of his being here, to get grace and salvation; and to think them happier then
himself, that may enjoy more liberty this way then he does; and though he
cannot in person be present with them, yet to be with them in heart and desire,
and to say with David, Psalm. 84. 4. Blessed are they that dwell in thy house.

So that of them that are glad of any business or excuse to keep them from
the Sermon; and count them fools that take more pains this way then
themselves, we may boldly say, their hearts are not upright within them.

5. They that with an honest heart, do use to spare some time from their
callings to employ this way, shall not need to fear that this will bring them
to beggary.

For 1. Godliness has the promise of the life that now is as well as of that
that which is to come, 1. Tim. 4. 8. And there is general promise made to all
that fear God, they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing, Psalm
34. 10. No rich man under heaven can be so assured, that he and his shall be
preserved from beggary, as every poor Christian may be.

2. There is a special promise this way, made to this part of godliness above
all other; that they that can make more account of Religion and Gods service,
then of earthly things shall be sure not to be loosers thereby, Psalm. 119. 165.
Great peace have they which love thy Law, and nothing shall offend them. Matthew.
6. 33. First seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness; and all these
things shall be added unto you. and 19. 29. Every one that has forsaken
houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or lands for my Name
sake, shall receive an hundred fold, and shall inherit everlasting life.

3. God has made these promises good by providing miraculously this way, for
such as have neglected their worldly estates, their profits, or ease out of
love to his service, No man shall desire thy land, when thou shall go up to
appear before the Lord thy God thrice in the year, Exodus 34. 24. yet were
their houses to be left very weak, all that while that all the males above 20.
years old were to continue at Jerusalem in those three feasts; and they had
many enemies in all their borders. So we read that our Savior did twice work
a miracle, to feed them that came far, and tarryed long to hear him preach,
Matthew. 14. 15. 21. and Mar. 8. 2 -- 9. And no marvel, for Heb. 6. 10. God is
not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of God. And what good Master
would suffer his servant to decay, and grow to beggary, by doing him service.

So that whosoever they be, that are thought by following Sermons, to have
decayed their estates, be you assured, that either their idleness and
unthriftiness otherwise has decayed them, or else they have followed
Sermons, for some by-respects, and not with uprightness of heart.

The second Use is for reproof; 1. To discover the unsoundness of most men's
hearts, who make so great reckoning of earthly things, and Use 2.
set their hearts upon them. It is evident they never yet found the true
treasure: they never truly tasted of heavenly comforts, they affect these
things so much, for that they know no better. This is made a note of the man
that shall ascend into the hill of the Lord, that he has not lift up his soul
unto vanity, Psalm 24. 4. If any man love the world the love of the Father is
not in him, 1. John 2. 15. Their end is destruction that mind earthly things,
Phil. 3. 19.

2. To reprove such Christians, as so ouercharge themselves with worldly
business, as they can find no time for Gods service.

Lecture the two and fiftieth, May 8. 1610. JOHN IIII. XXIX, XXX.
THe first point, wherein this Woman showed her zealous endeavor to draw her
neighbors unto Christ, we finished the last day; and now we are to proceed
unto the two last, viz. 1. The thing she moved her neighbors unto, when she
was come unto them: 2. The reason she used to persuade them to that she moved
them unto.

For the first, that we may understand her words well, and ground our Doctrine
upon them; it is to be observed.

1. Though she was her self fully persuaded that Jesus was the Christ, and did
with all her heart desire, that they might be also so persuaded of him; yet she
takes not upon her to teach and convert them her self, but seeks only to
bring them to the same means, whereby her self was converted.

2. Though she were able, by a good argument, to convince their consciences,
that he was the Messiah, and seeks also to do it; yet she thought not that
enough, she rests not in that, but would needs have them to come to him
themselves.

3. She desires no more of them, but that they would come and see him. Why (may
one say) what good would that do? could they know by seeing him, that he was
the Messiah? Did she think that the beholding of him would suffice to bring
them to faith? No surely, for many saw him that never could believe in him. One
would think she should rather have said; Come and hear him, then come and see
him; for faith comes by hearing, and not by seeing, Romans 10. 17. If the
having of Christ's picture before our eyes (that we may behold it when we pray)
had been such a help to faith and devotion as the Papists imagine; out of
doubt the Holy Ghost would have so described his stature, complexion and
countenance, in the History of the Gospel, as that we might have had some
directions to make his picture by. Why then desires she no more of them, but
that they would come and see him? I answer: 1. She doubted not, but if they
would but come to him, he would take occasion to instruct and convert them, as
he had done to her self: 2. When she bids them come and see, she means,
come and prove, and make trial whether he be not the Christ; as the same
phrase is used, Psalm. 34. 8. Taste ye and see how gracious the Lord is. So that
this is the Doctrine we are to learn from hence for our own instruction.

That this is a chief duty whereby every man must show his zeal and Doct. 3.
desire of the salvation of others, to draw them to the same means whereby
themselves were converted, to use that credit and power they have with them, to
draw them to the Ministry of the Word.

True it is, this is not all, that a private Christian may, and must do to
procure the conversion of others. For, 1. Some private Christians, are able to
teach their families, and neighbors themselves, and may do great good that
way; and all should seek to be able to do this. Aquila and Priscilla,
expounded the way of the Lord to Apollos, Acts 18. 26. Even women should be
able to teach their children, Pro. 1. 8. and 6. 20. and their servants, Pro.
31. 26. and their neighbors, Tit. 2. 3. 2. There is great force, in private
admonition and exhortation, to further the conversion of others, else our
Savior would not have prescribed this course for the restoring of a brother
that is fallen, that before we tell the Church, we should deal with him
privately, neither would he have given hope of giving our brother this way, as
he does, Mat. 18, 15, 16. Neither would this have been noted as a thing so
highly pleasing unto God, and in these desperate and profane times, Gods
people did use this means to preserve themselves from the common contagion,
Mal. 3. 16. Then they that feared the Lord spoke often one to another, and the
Lord hearkened and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him,
for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name. 3. A private
Christian, may greatly further the conversion of others, by his holy example.
Christian women may and ought so to live, as their husbands that obey not the
Word, may (without the Word) be won by the conversation of the wives, 1. Pet.
3. 1. The like may be said of children, servants, and neighbors also. 4. A
private Christian may do much, for the procuring of the salvation of others, by
his fervent prayer unto God for them, 1. John 5. 16. If any man see his brother
sin a sin that is not unto death, let him ask, and he shall give him life
for them that sin not unto death. When the Holy Ghost had mentioned the
fervent prayer that Steven made for his persecutors, Acts 7. 60. immediately he
adds, Acts 8. 1. And Saul consented to his death. As if he should say, Saul
was one of these he prayed for, and on him that prayer did light, whatsoever it
did on the rest.

But though a man, that has any zeal and desire of the salvation of others,
have thus many means whereby he may procure it, yet the chief means he can
use, is to draw them to the Ministry of the Word, to persuade them to hear.
See the proof of this, in the example of all such Christians as the Holy Ghost
has most commended, for their zeal in seeking the salvation of others. 1. For
neighbors; when the zeal that the faithful should have under the Gospel, is
prophesied of; it is said they should show it this way, Esaias 2. 3. Many people
shall go, and say, come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to
the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his ways. 2. For parents,
and Masters of families, we have the example of Elkanah the father of Samuel;
whose care of his children, and servants is commended in this, that though he
was well able to instruct them himself, yet he was wont always when he went
up to Shiloh (the place of Gods public worship) himself, to take all his
family with him, 1. Sam. 1. 21. 3. For kinsmen and special friends, we have
the example of Cornelius, whose zealous desire of the salvation of his kinsmen
and special friends was declared in this, that though he was one, that might
have been very likely, to prevail much with them, both by his prayer, example
and knowledge, yet he rested not there, but when the Lord had bid him send for
Peter, and told him he should speak to him words, whereby both himself, and
all his house should be saved, he got them all together, against Peter should
come, that they might be partakers of his Ministry with him, Acts 10 24.

The Reasons of this Doctrine are two. 1. It is the best means to remove that
prejudice which alienateth the minds of most men from the love Reasons.
of Religion, if they could be got to hear. It is a chief policy of the
devil whereby he keeps most men from the love of Religion, to work in them
a hard conceit of the best Ministers; either for some absurd opinions, that
they imagine them to hold, or for some gross crimes, that they think they
live in: This was the portion of all the Prophets, they had all manner of evil
spoken of them falsely, Matthew. 5. 11, 12, Yea this is so universal, that our
Savior makes it a note of a false Prophet, when a Minister has no slanders
raised on him, Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you; for so did
their fathers to the false Prophets, Luke 6. 26.

Now there is no such way whereby this prejudice may be removed out of the
minds of men, as if they could be drawn to hear. When Philip had spoken much
good of Christ: Nathaniel could not believe it: Why? Nathaniel had conceived
prejudice against Christ: how does Philip seek to remove this? Come and see
says he, John 1. 46. The officers that were sent to apprehend our Savior had
a very hard opinion of him, but when they had once heard him, they conceived
better of him, and said, John 7. 47. Never man spoke like this man.

2. There is far more power in the Ministry of the Word to prevail with the
heart of man, then in any means a private man is able to use, say he have as
good knowledge, and gifts as any Minister: No man has cause to hope, that
either the instruction he can give, or his good example, or his prayers, should
be able to do that good, as the Ministry of the Word may. For, 1. It is the
means God has ordained to do this mighty work by, It has pleased God by
the foolishness of preaching to save such as do believe, 1. Cor. 1. 21. and
is called therefore, 2. Cor. 3. 8. the Ministration of the Spirit. 2. God has
made a special promise to this ordinance of his, above all other means, that
he will be with it, to assist and bless it, Matthew. 28. 20. So as, 1. A man
has no hope, that any means he can use, should be able to convert his child,
servant, kinsman, or neighbor, till he can get him to be an hearer, How shall
they call upon him in whom they have not believed? How shall they believe in
him of whom they have not heard? Or how shall they hear without a preacher?
Romans 10. 14. 2. He may be assured this means will at one time or other (if
he belong to Gods election) prevail with him. Esaias 55. 3. Incline your ears
and come to me, hear, and your soul shall live; and if this prevail not,
nothing will, Luke 16. 31. If they hear not Moses and the Prophets, neither
will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

The Use is, 1. For all in general, to direct us in our prayers for the
Parliament Use 1.
at this time. We must hold our selves bound in conscience, to pray earnestly
to God, for the States of the Realm, now assembled in Parliament. Ester
undertaking a business that did much concern the whole Church (as they now
assembled in Parliament do) craved this help of Mordecay, and all Gods
people, that they would fast, and pray to God for her, Ester 4. 16. Pray that
their principal care may be to take order. 1. That an able and conscionable
Ministry may be placed every where 2. That all the people may be compelled to
hear. For the first, It is said of Iehosaphat, 2. Chron. 17. 6. That he did
lift up his heart to the ways of the Lord (and Oh that our States now would
do so!) But how did he show that, verse 7. He set Princes throughout all the
Cities of Judah to teach, that is, to see the people taught, verse 9. And see
the fruit and effect o^ this, verse 10. And the fear of the Lord fell upon all
the kingdoms of the Lands, that were round about Judah, so that they made no
war against Iehosaphat. This would free us from fear of the traitorous
Papists at home, and abroad. For a faithful Ministry (if it were placed every
where) would be as the charriots and horsemen of Israel, 2. Kings 13. 14. Even
the King himself acknowledged so much. And yet see a second fruit of it, 2.
Chron. 17. verse 12. And Iehosaphat waxed great exceedingly, and he built in
Judah Castles, and Cities of store. This would make our State and Kingdom to
prosper, and flourish; if the States would lift up their hearts to this work.
There would be no crying in our streets, Psalm. 144. 14. no danger of invasion,
or such like evils.

The second thing we should pray for them, is that they may take order, Use 2.
that where there is such a Ministry planted, the people may be compelled to
hear. It is to no purpose to bind Papists to come to Church, unless order
first be taken that they may be well taught when they come there. But it is
certain, that where there is a good Ministry established, the Magistrate may
and ought to compel all his subjects to come and hear, notwithstanding all
pretense of their conscience to the contrary. This is evident by the speech the
Lord uses to his servant (by whom not the Minister only but the Magistrate is
meant) Luke 14. 23. Go out into the high ways and hedges, and compel them to
come in, that my house may be filled: and by the practice of good Josiah, 2.
Chron. 34. 22, 23. who compelled all that were found in Israel to serve the
Lord their God.

The second Use of this Doctrine, is for direction to Masters of families. They
have a calling and authority to teach their children and their servants, as we
have heard: but they must know their office and calling is subordinate to the
office and calling of the Minister; he may not presume above his calling and
gift. His chief duties are these: 1. To use his authority and interest that he
has in the hearts of his children and servants, to draw them to go with him
to the Ministry of the Word, as we heard out of 1. Sam. 1. 21. When Elkanah
went to Shiloh, he took all his house with him. When Naaman came to do his
homage to God, 2. Reg. 5. 15. It is said, he and all his company came and stood
before the man of God. 2. He must use his best skill and endeavor to make the
Ministry of the Word profitable to his family, by examining them, by making
things plainer to them, and applying them more particularly then they were in
the public Ministry. This our Savior himself used as the most profitable
family-exercise that could be; for examining them, see Matthew. 13. 51. and for
opening things unto them which they had heard, Mar. 4. 34. This will give an
edge to that that is publicly taught, Deuteronomy. 6. 7. in the margin. 3. Though he
may when he reads a Chapter in his family, give notes, and observe what he
learneth out of it; for his own and their instruction, yea he may ask his
family also what they can learn and observe out of that they read, (for Romans
15. 4. Whatsoever is written is written for our learning) yet may not he take
upon him to interpret the Scriptures, or to teach any thing out of them to his
family, but what he has learned at the public Ministry. Say a man have been
trained in Schools of learning, and have never so great gifts, and fitness to
exercise a public office in the Church; yet may he not take upon him to
Minister, till he first be proved, 1. Tim. 3. 10. Much less may a private
Christian take upon him, to analyze or interpret (which is the most difficult
thing, and requires most skill, of any thing that belongs to the work of the
Ministry) not being approved to have such a gift.

That would certainly open a gappe to most dangerous confusion and schism,
and error. It is good therefore for all private Christians to hearken to that
counsel the Apostle gives, Romans 12. 3. For I say through the grace given unto
me, to every one that is among you, not to think more highly of himself then
he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God has dealt to every
man the measure of faith.

The third Use of this Doctrine is for reproof; for this argues plainly,
that there is in most men (even of them that make a good profession) Use 3.
no desire or care either of their own salvation, or of those that are
nearest, and ought to be dearest unto them: because 1. They care not what
Ministry they live under, whereas this ought to be the chief care of a
Christian, to plant himself and his, and to dwell there where he and they may
enjoy Gods ordinance, as you may see, One thing have I desired of the Lord that
I will seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of
my life, Psalm. 27. 4. 2. In placing of their children either in service, or
marriage, they are utterly careless, what Ministry they shall live under:
whereas though they have given them never so good education while they have
lived with them, they have just cause to fear, they shall decay and loose that
grace they have, if they shall not continue to live under a true Ministry,
Where there is no vision the people decay, Pro. 29. 18. Nay, for the most part
they of all other prove the most ungracious that have had best education, when
once they loose the benefit of the public Ministry.

Lecture the three and fiftieth, June 12. 1610. JOHN IIII. XXIX.
IT remains now that we come unto the third and last thing, that the
Evangelist observes in the endeavor of this woman, to draw her neighbors
unto Christ, viz. the reason she used to persuade them to come unto him, to
Come and see him, in these words, Come and see a man which has told me all
things that ever I did. She does not in plain terms affirm him to be
Christ, but alleging the experience herself had had of his divine and
supernatural knowledge, she appealeth to their own consciences whether this
be not a good argument to prove him to be the Messiah, He has told me all
things that ever I did.

Now before we come to the Doctrine that the Holy Ghost intends to teach us
in this place, two doubts are to be answered for the better understanding of
the words, 1. How she says, Christ had told her all that ever she did, seeing
it may seem by verse 17, 18. that Christ told her of no sin, but of her
fornication only.

The answer is: 1. That it may very well be, that our Savior told her much
more, then is there expressed; for the Evangelist (we know) uses not to set
down fully, and at large, all the speeches or actions of our Savior, but
those points which were principal and of chiefest use. 2. It is evident verse
18. That he told her, not only of the whoredom she lived in at that present,
but how many husbands she had had, and so declared that he knew well what her
life had been from the beginning. 3. There is no inconvenience will follow, if
we grant that (out of the abundance of her heart, as in all languages men have
been wont to do in like cases) she did use an excess of speech which we call
Hyperbole; so that when her meaning was to say, he has told me many things
that I have done, even the most secret things that ever I did, she might well,
and without all untruth express it thus, He has told me all that ever I did;
as Matthew. 3. 5. It is said that Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region
round about Jordan, came to John to be baptized, because very many out of those
parts came, and though it be evident by Luke 7. 30. that they came not all. And
Christ is said, Heb. 2. 9. To have tasted death for all men, because he dyed
for many, as it is expressed in the very next verse, He brought many children
unto glory.

Now in that this Woman that had now truth of grace in her; not only affirms,
that Christ had told her all that ever she did, but also alleges this as an
argument, to prove him to be the Messiah, the Son of God.

We learn this Doctrine: That the Lord is privy to all the ways of men, and
can tell us all that ever we did. But this Doctrine and the Uses Doct. 2.
of it we have alread handled in the fourteenth Lecture, and therefore I will
pass by it here.

Lecture the four and fiftieth, June 19. 1610. JOHN IIII. XXX.
Follows now the success, God gave to the zealous endeauours that this Woman
used to draw her neighbors unto Christ, which is set down in this verse. In
which we are to observe, that which we may wonder at, if we observe it well; 1.
That upon her speech they went out of the City and came to Christ: and 2. They
were a great many that did so, as may appear, verse 39. 41. 3. They believed
upon her report that he was the Messiah, verse 39.

Now from hence we have this instruction to learn: That the conversion Doct.
of a man to Christ, depends neither on the worthiness of the party that is
converted, nor on the excellency of the means, whereby he is converted, but
only upon the free grace and pleasure of Almighty God. This is that the
Apostle teaches, Iam. 1. 18. Of his own will begat he us, with the word of
truth, Romans 9. 18. He has mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will
he hardens. But the truth of this Doctrine shall more clearly appear to you
in these points.

1. He gives the means of grace to some, and denies them to other, every whit
as worthy as they, he forbad Paul to preach in Asia or Bithynia, and called
him to preach in Macedonia, Acts 16. 6, 7, 10. Our Savior did that at
Capernaum which he refused to do at Nazaret his own country; as Elias was
sent to a widow in Sarepta, and not to any of the widows that were in Israel;
and Elizeus cleansed Naaman the Syrian, where as there were many lepers in
Israel that were not cleansed by him. England has had the preaching of the
Gospel these fifty years together, Spain nor Italy never had it since the
days of the Primitive Church: nay, Ireland for the most part (though it be
under the same government) never had it; nay, even in England, many Towns have
had it without intermission these 50. years together; many never had it yet.
And what may be imagined to be the cause of this? Surely this has come to
pass, neither by chance, nor by the will of man, but it has been the Lords
doing alone. He that said, Amos 4. 7. I have withheld the rain from you,
and I caused it to rain upon one City, and caused it not to rain upon another
City; it is he only that has caused the Word to be preached in some places,
and caused it not to be preached in other some: And what has moved him to do
this? Surely no worthiness he saw in these Countries, towns or persons, to
whom he granted his Gospel, above the rest, to whom he has denied it; but his
good pleasure only, as the Apostle teaches, 2. Tim. 1. 9. He has called us
with an holy calling, not according to our own wrokes, but according to his
own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the world
was.

Secondly, among those to whom he gives the means, we shall find to some they
are blessed; Others (every whit as worthy; and more likely to receive good by
them) are never the better for them: 1. Some few in those places that enjoy the
means, feel Gods power in them to their conversion, Ier. 3. 14. One of City,
and two of a Tribe; and the greatest part (by far) is never the better for
them, Matthew. 22. 14. Many are called, but few are chosen. 2. Some simple rude
people, are wont to find such a blessing on the means, as that they attain
to great measure of knowledge, and grace by them; whereas others of better
nature, capacity and education, enjoying the very same means, can feel no
sweetness, or power in them. I give thee thanks O Father, Lord of heaven and
earth (says our Savior, Matthew 11. 25.) that thou have hidden these things
from the wise and prudent, and revealed them unto habes. 3. Some that have
been notoriously and infamously wicked, we see are often converted by the
means, and made new men. Others become most vile and wicked men by them, that
were very civil and moral men before. By the same Ministry whereby the
Publicans and Harlots were converted, the Scribes and Pharisees were made
outragiously wicked, Matthew. 21. 31, 32. And from whence comes this, that the
means of salvation, do good on some, and no good on other? Surely, not from
the worthiness of the persons that are converted, or from the excellency of
the means, but only from the good pleasure of Almighty God, according as we
have seen, Even so, O Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight, Matthew. 11.
26. He has mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardneth,
Romans 9. 18.

3. Though he do use to work by means; yet the means, he is wont to work
by, are so weak and simple, that they are more likely to hinder his work,
then to further it at all. In his most miraculous works, he has been wont to
use means; but they were such, as all the world might see, had in themselves
no force at all to effect that which he wrought by them. See this, Josh. 6. 3.
(...). They must 1. Go round about the City for six days together, once a
day, and seven times the seventh day. 2. The last time they had gone round
about it, the Priests must blow the trumpets of Rams-hornes seven times. 3.
When these trumpets had been blown the seventh time, all the people must give
a shout, and then the walls fell down flat. Do you not think the men of
Jericho scorned them all this while, and thought them out of their wits? The
like we shall see in a miraculous cure done upon Naaman the Leper, he must go
wash himself in ^ordan seven times, and then he should be clean 2. Reg. 5.
10. And upon a man that was borne blind, Christ made clay with his spittle, and
a^nointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, John 9. 6. And so does he
in the great work of man's conversion use means, yea he has set down and
appointed in his Word what means he will use, and without which he never uses
to work. But what are these means: Surely, (...). Corinthians 1. 21. The
foolishness of preaching, that is; 1. Preaching, which the most men, and
wisest men in the world, all that perish, esteem contemptibly of, and account
mere foolishness, 1. Cor. 1. 18. 23. 2. The preaching of such men as have no
show with them in the world, no outward means to draw men after them; such as
the Apostles were, poor Fishermen of Galilee, such as were commonly esteemed
ignorant and unlearned men, Acts 4. 13 3. Such a kind of preaching, as is
plain, and without all ostentation, and show of humane gifts, as the Apostle
protests his was, 1. Cor. 2. 4. his speech and his preaching was not with the
entising words of man's wisdom.

2. Yea, we shall find he has been wont to work more mightily by very weak
and unlikely means, then by such as have been far more excellent and likely
to do good. As he fed five thousand with five loaves, and yet twelve baskets
full of the fragments remained, Matthew. 14. 17. 21. and but four thousand with
seven loaves, and yet but seven baskets of fragments remained, Matthew. 15. 36.
38. And this poor woman prevailed more with a great company of Samaritans,
then either Mary, or the two Disciples could do with the eleven Apostles,
Mark 16. 11, 13. Yea, she drew more to Christ, at one time, then we read
either the twelve Apostles that were sent forth to preach, Matthew. 10. Or the
seventy Disciples that were sent forth to preach, Luke 10. Or John the Baptist
did at any one time. Joshua though a person far inferior to Moses in gifts,
and but his servant, yet was his government blessed far above Moses; and the
people much better in his time, then they had been in the days of Moses;
Insomuch as, he in his age gives that testimony of them, Josh. 23. 8. that
they had stuck fast to the Lord, even to that day. And there were many more
converted by the Ministry of the Apostles, then by Christ himself; yea, many
that despised him while himself preached, by their Ministry were converted to
him, John 8. 28. When ye have lift up the Son of man, then shall ye know
that I am he. 3. Yea, we shall find that God has been wont to prepare such
of his servants, as by whom he has intended to do greatest good to his Church,
by making them see, how weak and insufficient they have been, and by bringing
them to a base conceit of themselves. So dealt he with Moses, Exodus 4. 10. with
Esaias, Esaias 6. 5. with Jeremy, Chap. 1. 6. and with Paul, 1. Cor. 2. 3. and 2.
Cor. 2. 16.

Would you know the reason why God gives the means to some, and denies Reason.
them to others more worthy then they; why he blesses the means to some, and
not to others; why he uses to work by such weak means, and more by them
(often) then by stronger? Surely the reason is this, that his glory might the
more appear in them whom he does save. For if all should have the means of
grace; or if all should profit by them that have them, Gods mercy should not so
much be magnified in the conversion of the Elect; or if the Lord should use to
work by strong means only, the glory of the work would be ascribed to the
means, and not unto him, whereas now the whole praise redounds to the Lord
himself, 2. Cor. 4. 7. The excellency of the power is of God, and not of us.
Matthew. 21. 16. Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou have perfected
praise.

1. To persuade all men if they want the means, to seek to God for them, yea
to persuade us that have the means, to pray for them that want Use 1.
the means, and cannot feel their own want, nor pray for themselves: for 1.
There is no hope God will save men without means, Romans 10. 14. How can they
believe unless they hear: 2. It is the Lord only that withholdeth the means
from them, and who only must give them the means whoeuer be the instrument,
Matthew. 9. 38. He is the Lord of the harvest, and he only must send forth
laborers into his harvest. 3. Why does he withhold the means, because he has
no respect to them, nor care of their salvation, Act. 17. 30. The times of this
ignorance God regarded not. If men were persuaded of this, they would not live
under a dumb Ministry themselves, yea they would pity them more that do.

2. To persuade such as enjoy the means, yea the best means, not to rest in
this; or to think it sufficient, that they frequent the means; but to seek 2.
earnestly to God, both before they come, and after, for his blessing; and to
carry themselves with that reverence and devotion, while they are in the use of
the means, as they may approve themselves to him; for 1. The best Ministry
shall never do thee good, unless the Lord work with it, as the water of
Bethesda (though it had virtue in it, to heal all infirmities) yet it cured
none, until the Lord had sent his Angel to stir the water, John 5. 4. so
though the Ministry of the Word have a great virtue in it, and be able to save
our souls, Iam. 1. 21. yet can it convert none, unless the Lord work with
it, 1. Cor. 3. 7. Neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that waters,
but God that gives the increase. 2. If it do thee no good, it will do thee
hurt, 2. Cor. 2. 16. It is a savor of death, where it is not a savor of life.
3. The true cause (as thou have heard) why thou profitest not, is because the
Lord favors thee not; the Lord has no respect unto thee; those whom the
Lord loves, shall profit by the means, yea by very weak means. Thou have
enjoyed great and excellent means a long time, and can not profit by them.
Consider the true cause of it, John 8. 47. Ye therefore hear not (that is
profitably, for they all heard) because ye are not of God. If men were
persuaded of this, they would be troubled for their great unprofitableness;
they would be more earnest with God for his blessing upon his ordinance

3. To admonish Christians, not to despise the Ministry of the meanest of Gods
servants; but to reverence Gods ordinance, even in the weakest 3.
Ministry. I speak not this, to countenance and justify the Ministry of every
one that takes upon him to preach, or to tie Gods people to rest upon them.
For I know well: 1. There be many that run before they be sent, Ier. 23. 2^.
2. It were as intolerable bondage and tyranny, to bind Gods people to rest
upon the Ministry of such as cannot instruct them, as it were to compel
infants to abide with such nurses, as have neither suck nor food to give them
I dare not condemn such Christians, as having Pastors in the places where
they live, of meaner gifts, do desire (so they do without open breach or
contempt of the Churches order) to enjoy the Ministry of such as have better
gifts; and sometimes do leave their own, to hear the other; so they do it
without contempt of their own Pastors, and without scandal and offense to
th^mand their people. Because, 1. That though sundry of the hearers (not of the
Scribes and Pharisees only) but of John the Baptist also did often frequent
Christ's Ministry, not only on other days, but even on Sabbaths also; yet I
cannot find, that our Savior did ever blame them for it. 2. Though the Lord
do oft-times work most mightily by weakest means, yet ordinarily and for the
most part, as by the wholesomest and best food, he gives the best nourishment;
so by the Ministry of them that have the best gifts, he does most edify his
people. Therefore the great success of John's Ministry is partly ascribed to
the excellent gifts God gave him, and whereby he fitted him for that work, he
shall go before him, in the spirit and power of Elia to turn the hearts of the
fathers to the children. Luke 1. 17. So this is alleged for one cause of the
success of Barnabas his Ministry in Antioch, Act. 11. 14. Because he was a
good man, and full of the holy Ghost and says; and of the fruit that both his
Ministry, and Paul's had in Iconium, that they preached in such a manner, so
soundly, so substantia^ly, with such evidence of the spirit, Act. 14. 1. They
so spoke that a great multitude both of the Jews, and also of the Greeks
believed. Therefore ^aul calls upon Timothy, to stir up his gift, 2 Timothy 1.
6. and to give himself diligently to study for the increase of his gifts, 1 Timothy 4. 14, 15. and tells him this was the way, to save himself, and them
that hear him, ver. ^6. So. Cor. 14 12. He exho^t them to seek for such
gifts, as whereby they might excel to the edifying of the Church. Why (might
some have objected) what needs this? seeing we may do as much by mean, as
by excellent gifts? But the Apostle plainly declares by these exhortations
that he was of another mind. 3. Every Christian has right and title to the
gifts of all Gods servants, and therefore it is no sin for them (when
conveniently they may) to make their benefit of them, Whether Paul, or Apollo,
or Cephas, all are yours, 1. Cor. 3. 22. yet must every Christian take heed
that he do not so admire Gods gifts in any, as that he despise the Ministry of
the meanest of Gods servants; nor commend one to the disgracing of others, nor
rest or addict himself so to one, as that he despise others. This was that
sin, for which the Apostle so taxes the Corinthians, every one of you says,
I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, 1. Cor. 1. 12, For 1. It is
our sin and shame, and just cause of humbling to us, if we cannot profit by
the meanest Minister that God has sent, ye may all prophecy one by one, that
all may learn, and all may be comforted, all may learn by every one that
prophecyeth and preaches the word soundly, and may receive comfort and
edification by him, 1. Cor. 14. 31. 2. The power of the Ministry depends not
(as we have heard) on the excellency of the teachers gifts, but upon Gods
blessing that he has promised, and is wont to give to his own ordinance.

4. The fourth and last Use, is to encourage every man, in his place, to do his
endeavor, to draw others to God, both Ministers, and Masters of families, 4.
and private Christians also. For, 1. If thou do prevail, and God make thee
his instrument to convert but one soul, the comfort, and blessing of it, will
be unspeakable, Let him know that he which conuerteth a sinner from the error
of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins,
James 5. 20. 2. If thou endeavor it with an honest heart, be thy gifts never
so weak and mean, thou have cause to expect Gods blessing, and that thou
shall prevail with some, 2. Chron. 29. 11. Deal courageously, and the Lord
shall be with the good. An example of this we have in this poor woman. 3. Say
thou prevail with none, yet shall thy endeavor, used with a good heart, be
every whit as well accepted of God, and rewarded also, as if thou had
converted many. Thy work shall be with the Lord: Esaias 49. 4. 2. Cor. 2. 25.
For we are unto God a sweet savor of Christ, in them that are saved and in
them that perish.

THE FIVE AND FIFTIETH LECTVRE, ON JUNE, XXVI. MDCX.
IOH. IIII. XXXI, XXXII, XXXIII, XXXIV. In the mean while, his Disciples
prayed him, saying: Master eat.

But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.

Therefore said the Disciples one to another, has any man brought him ought to
eat?

Jesus says unto them, my meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to
finish his work.


We have heard in the former verses, what zeal the Woman of Samaria (being
converted her self) did show, in seeking the conversion of all her neighbors,
and what a blessing God gave to her endeauours therein: For (upon her
persuasion) they went out of the City, and came to Christ. Now in these verses
that I have read, and those four that follow, the Evangelist reports the
speech, that passed between Christ and his Disciples, in the mean time while
the woman was in going to call her neighbors, and they in coming out of the
City unto Christ. And this speech consists of two parts. 1. The declaration
of our Saviors zeal, in preferring the work of his Ministry before his meat
and drink, (contained in these four verses I have now read unto you;) 2. The
exhortation that he gives unto his Disciples, to follow his example therein,
(in the four verses following.) And in the first part (the verses I have now
read) four things are noted by the Evangelist: 1. The motion which the
Disciples make unto him, that he would eat somewhat, a motion no whit unfit,
or unseasonable for them to make at this time. For, 1. It was now dinner time,
as appears ver. 6. and his manner was (as it seems) to eat two meals in a
day, as we read also that Eliah (notwithstanding his strict course of life)
was wont to do, 1. Kings 17. 6. 2. They perceived him to be weary, verse 6.
and in that respect also to have need of refreshing. 3. They found him to be
now at leisure, and free from other employment 4. They thought they should have
gone forward their journey to Galilee that afternoon, verse 3, 4. 5. They
perceived by him, that (though he was hungry, and had sent them into the Town
to buy meat, yet) now they were come to him with meat, and had set it before
him, he had no disposition to eat any, and therefore (out of their duty and
love unto him) they desire him to eat, verse 31.

2. The answer Christ makes unto this their motion, verse 32. He had meat to
eat, that they knew not of. He says not, that he had eaten already; yet was
he (doubtless) refreshed, with the pains he had taken, and good he had done
already upon the Woman of Samaria; but he looks for a second and a better
service, and keeps his stomach for it. He knew (and so did not they) what a
multitude of the Samaritans were coming toward him.

3 The question which the Disciples had among themselves about this answer
their Master had made unto them, verse 33. They wondered how he (in that place)
should come by meat. Yet (out of the reverence they bear to his person) they
durst not ask him, but only inquired among themselves, how that might be.

4. The manifestation that Christ himself makes of his own meaning in that
answer he had given unto them, verse 34. The meat he spoke of, was 1. To do
the will of him that sent him, that is, to instruct and save souls. 2. To
finish his work. It is my meat (says Christ) to finish it, to exercise my
self in it still, even to the end of my days. And this he calls his meat. 1.
Because of the appetite and desire he had to it, as men have to their meat, he
desired nothing so earnestly. 2. Because it refreshed him maruailously; no
food, no dainties, were so sweet unto him.

The first thing then that in these verses offreth it self to our
consideration, is this, that the Disciples (out of the love and respect they
had unto our Savior) do move and entreat him to eat somewhat, and that he
blames them not for this. From whence we have this to learn.

That though a Christians chief care should be for his own soul, and the
souls of other men, yet the bodies of men may not be neglected, but must be
Doct. (...).
nourished, and cared for also; especially theirs, whose health and strength
may be of most service, and use to God, and his Church. 1. For the care of our
selves this way, see a plain direction given us by the Apostle, Ephesians. 5. 29.
No man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it. And 2.
For the care we should have of others, it is to be observed, that when our
Savior had restored the daughter of Iairus to life, he commanded that
something should be given her to eat, Mar. 5. 43. and that all those works of
mercy unto which the Lord will show such respect at the day of judgment,
Matthew. 25. 42, 4^. are such as had been showed upon the bodies of Gods
servants. And lastly, for the special care should be had of the bodily health,
and strength of such, as whose service may be of special use to God and his
Church: We have a notable example in the care of the Apostle had of Timothy,
for Timothy being a young man and unmarried, for the suppressing of the lusts
of youth, and the better obtaining of the gift of continency, did altogether
forbear the drinking of wine, and used to drink water only, and thereby
weakened his stomach, and brought upon himself many other infirmities. Paul
therefore forbids him, 1. Tim. 5. 23. to drink water any longer, and charge
him to drink wine.

The Reasons of the Doctrine are four.

1. The commandment of God that forbids us to kill and take away the Reasons.
life either of our selves or others, Exodus 20. 13. commands us to use all
good means for the preserving of life both in our selves and others. Our
bodies and lives are not our own to do with, what we list, but the Lord is
the God of our life, Psalm. 42. 8. and our bodies are his, and not our own, as
the Apostle speaks, 1. Cor. 6. 19. 20. and therefore the wrong we do to our
bodies, redoundeth unto him.

2. All the creatures of God that serve for the preservation and health, and
comfort of our bodies, are given us by God, to that end that we might use and
enjoy them, and give him praise, I brought you into a plentiful country (says
the Lord, Ier. 2. 7. to eat the fruit thereof, and the goodness thereof. And
the Apostle, 1. Tim. 6. 17. He gives us richly all things to enjoy, and 1. Tim.
4. 3. God has created meats to be received with thanksgiving of them which
believe and know the truth. And therefore the neglecting to use them for the
comfort of the body, must needs argue unthankfulness unto God, and a light
esteem of his goodness and bounty.

3. The bodies of Gods servants are the members of Christ, 1. Cor. 6. 15. and
the Temples of the Holy Ghost, 1. Cor. 6. 19. and in that respect they must not
be neglected, but there is an honor due unto them.

4. And lastly, the body is the servant of the soul, and the instrument
whereby it works, and therefore the neglect of it will greatly disable the
soul, and hinder the functions and actions of it, and besides make it subject
to many passions and fancies that otherwise it might be free from. Therefore
when our Savior speaks how the Lord fitted him to the work of mediation and
redemption, says Heb. 10. 5. A body have thou prepared me, thou have given me
a body fit for that work and service.

The Use of this Doctrine is: 1. For reproof of such as in their health Use.
(upon pretense of Religion and mortification) neglect and macerate their
bodies, and deny them such helps and comforts as are necessary for them. I
grant that it is sometimes profitable and necessary to abridge our selves of
the comforts of this life: 1. For the taming and mortifying of the flesh, and
bringing of the body in subjection to the soul, I keep under my body and
bring it into subjection, 1. Cor. 9. 17. 2. For the profession of our
repentance and humiliation before God, Ezra did eat no bread, nor drink
water, for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been
carried away, Ezra 10. 6. 3. For our help in extraordinary prayer, Let them
not feed nor drink water, but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and
cry mightily unto God, Ion. 3. 7, 8. In which three respects, God enjoined his
people to keep a day of solemn abstinence once every year, though they had
no other extraordinary occasion to move them to it, Leuit. 23. 29. But even at
such times the Lord requires us to keep that measure as that we neglect not
the health of our bodies, nor make them unserviceable unto us, I will have
mercy, and not sacrifice says the Lord, Matthew. 12. 7. And the rather because
we are easily drawn to hypocrisy this way, and even to put holiness in
willworship, and humility, and neglecting of the body, as the Apostle notes,
Colos. 2. 23.

2. For reproof of such as in their sickness refuse or neglect the benefit of
Physic. True it is: 1. That it is the Lord only, who both sends sickness
upon others, and withholds those diseases from us and our families that fall
upon others; and who heals us when we are sick, whether we have taken
Physic or no; if we recover our health, it is the Lord that heals us, he is
the God of our life, Psalm. 42. 8. and of our health also, he is the strength of
our life, Psalm. 27. 1. yea, it cannot be denied, but that he recouereth many
out of most dangerous diseases without the help of Physic, when the Lord had
promised this as a blessing to such as fear him, and hearken diligently to his
voice, that he will bring none of these diseases upon them that he has brought
upon others, this reason he gives for it, Exodus 15. 26. For I am the Lord that
heals thee. 2. That some receive no good by Physic, because they seek not
first to God, but make an Idol of it, as Asa is noted to have done, 2. Chron.
16. 12. 3. That many receive hurt by it; because they use it when they have no
need of it; some use it out of niceness and pride, to make themselves fine and
beautiful; some because they would not be accounted among the common sort; nay
some to that end that they may make their bodies the more apt to sin; and so is
Tobacco abused by many people. And surely for these sins, God often depriues his
good creatures of their virtue to do good. 4. That the greatest part can
receive no benefit by it, because the covetousness of most Physicians bars
and excludes them from it. We read of a poor woman, Mar. 5. 26. that had spent
all she had among them, and was not bettered by them. And yet for all this, it
is most certain, that many perish before their time, and are guilty of their
own death by the wilful neglect of Physic. And it is a great sin for a
Christian in a dangerous sickness, not to seek the benefit of Physic, if he
may have it: for 1. It is the ordinance God has appointed for the restoring of
health to them that are sick. God provided in his law that when any man was
hurt by another, 1. Means should be used that he may be healed, yea thoroughly
healed. 2. That he that had hurt him should be at the whole charge of the cure,
Exodus 21. 19. And Joseph we know kept Physicians of his own, Genesis 50 2. And
the sick have need of a Physician, says our Savior, Matthew. 9. 12. 2. It
being Gods ordinance every man that needs it, and may have the benefit of it,
is bound to use it, Every creature is good (says the Apostle, 1. Tim 4. 4.)
and nothing ought to be refused. 3. It is a high degree of sin (even a
tempting of God) to expect health from God, when we wilfully refuse this
means, whereby he has appointed to give us health, as our Savior says he
should have tempted God if he should have cast himself down from the pinnacle
of the Temple, in expectation of an extraordinary protection from God when
there was an ordinary way from him to come down by, Mat. 4. 7. It carries (I
know) a great show of piety and patience, when men shall say, let the Lord do
his will, I commit my self into his hands, but this is a high degree of sin.

The Doctrine serves also for the reproof of such as by excess and disorder,
do overthrow the health and estate of their bodies, namely such as by 3.
pampering of their bodies, do quite overthrow them. Such are not only our
common drunkards, but they also that drink more then does them good, such as
use excess of wine or strong drink, 1. Pet. 4 3. that seek out the strongest
drink they can find, and use to sit long at it, Pro. 23. 30. that count this
their glory that they are mighty to drink wine, and strong to power in strong
drink, Esaias 5. 22. These men are certainly guilty of many sins: 1. They sin
against God in abusing his good creatures. The wine and strong drink they thus
abuse is not their own, nor the money neither that they buy it with, but the
Lords, she did not know that I gave her corn and wine and oil, and multiplied
her silver and gold, Hos. 2. 8. and the right use God has given it, for, is 1.
The cheering of the spirits of such as are heavy hearted, Pro. ^1. 6, 7. 2.
That men in the liberal use of them might serve him with ioyfulnes and gladness
of heart, Deuteronomy. 28. 47. But these men abuse them to the disabling of themselves
for his service, and grow thereby profane, and haters of all goodness: 2. They
sin against their neighbors, not only by evil example, but even by provoking
God to deprive us of our plenty, and to bring a dearth. And that is the cause
why the drunkard is first of all called upon to mourn for the dearth that God
threatened, Joel 1. 5. 3. They sin against their own souls, by impenitency,
that they cannot leave this sin; nor so much as discern it in themselves,
though all other men see it and note them for it. Thus the Holy Ghost
describes the drunkard, Pro. 23. 35. They have stricken me, shall thou say,
and I was not sick, they have beaten me, and I felt it not, when shall I
awake? I will seek it yet again. 4. They sin against their own bodies, 1. By
bringing upon them diseases, Hos. 7. 5. The Princes made him sick with bottles
of wine 2. By making them unserviceable to their souls, through a strange
sottishness they have brought upon themselves thereby, Hos. 4. 11. Wine and
new wine take away the heart, bereave them of all use of their reason and
understanding. And it is no small matter (I tell you) to sin thus even
against their body; for the Apostle aggrauateth this sin of fornication even
by this argument, 1. Cor. 6. 18. He that commits fornication, sins
against his own body.

Lecture the six and fiftieth, July 3. 1610. JOHN IIII. XXXII, XXXIV.
IT follows that we proceed unto the answer which our Savior makes unto
their motion. And for the better understanding of the words, we must know 1.
That the cause why he did now forbear to eat, was not for that he had no need
of meat; for it is certain, that he was subject to hunger and thirst, and had
as much need of meat and drink as we have. We read Matthew. 21. 18. that he was
hungry in a morning. And at this time also, he was both hungry and thirsty, else
would he not have asked water of the Woman to drink, nor sent his Disciples
into the town to buy victuals.

2. Neither was this the cause why he did forbear to eat at this time,
because he put some holiness in abstinence; or thought that the service he
should do to his father in instructing the Samaritans, would be ever a whit
the more meritorious or acceptable unto him, because he did it fasting; or 3.
For that he purposed herein to give unto his Disciples an example of
mortification, and of contempt of these earthly comforts. For 1. Then he would
have used thus to abstain from meat at other times, as well as now. Whereas we
do not read that ever he was much given to fasting. Nay he professes
himself to have been unlike unto John the Baptist, even in this point, the
Son of man came eating and drinking says he, Matthew. 11. 19. yea he was wont
to take the benefit of Gods creatures; not of such only as serve for man's
necessity, but of such also as God has given us for our delight. It was noted
of him by his carping enemies that he was wont to drink wine, Luke 7. 34. And
it is said of him twice, that he suffered his feet to be anointed with very
precious ointment, Luke 7. 38. and John 12. 3. 5. neither refused he to go to
feasts when he was bidden; no not upon the Sabbath day, Luke 14. 1. And for his
Disciples, we know there was offense taken at him, because he did not teach
them to fast, Luke 5. 33. Why then does he forbear his meat at this time?
surely because he would not let slip a notable occasion and opportunity of
winning souls to God, which he knew was now to be offered unto him. He had
another matter in hand, which he calls his meat, which he did as earnestly
desire as any hungry man can desire meat, and which he knew would delight,
refresh and comfort him as much as any meat, can do him that stands most in
need of it; and that was to win and convert souls unto God. Why but (may
some say) he might have eaten somewhat in the mean while, in the space wherein
the woman was going to fetch her neighbors, and they in coming out of the
City unto him. So that his eating of somewhat, need have been no hinderance to
that good work he so much desired to do, but a furtherance rather unto it. I
answer, it is true, he might have done so, but his heart was so taken up either
in secret prayer to God for them, or in meditation of that he was to teach them
when they should come, or with the joyful expectation of their coming, and of
the good he knew he should have occasion to do, as it made him quite to forget
all hunger and thirst. Now that we may receive our instruction from this
notable example of our Saviors zeal, which is here set forth for our
imitation, let us observe these three points in it. 1. That he is so careful
to take the occasion and opportunity Obseru.
that is here offered of enlarging his Fathers Kingdom, that (though he was
hungry) he neglects his meat for it. 2. That he calls this his meat, to do
the will of his Father, in instructing and converting of men. 3. That (though
he had time to eat without any hinderance unto that work) yet the care he had
of this business, and joy he conceived in the expectation of the good he was
to do, made him forget his hunger.

And from hence this Doctrine will arise for our instruction: That, he that
will be a true Disciple of Christ, must be zealous in the Lords business,
Doct. 2.
zealous in serving God, and seeking to honor him. It is not sufficient to a
man's comfort, that he has professed the truth, served God in his calling, done
the duties God has required of him, unless he have done it with a zealous
heart, and earnest affection. This is required of us that would approve our
selves to God in preaching of his Word. Apollos is commended for this, Acts 18.
25. that being fervent in the spirit he taught diligently the things of the
Lord, This is required in them that hear the Word, Luke 24. 32. Did not our
hearts burn within us when he opened to us the Scriptures. This is required
of them that would pray with comfort, James 5. 16. The effectual fervent
prayer, of a righteous man avails much. This is required in every part of
that service that we do unto God, we must be Romans 12. 11. Fervent in spirit
serving the Lord. Yea this is in general required of us in our whole
profession and practice of Religion, Tit. 2. 14, Christ gave himself for us to
purify to himself a peculiar people zealous of good works. Therefore it is
noted to the praise of Iehosaphat, that he lift up his heart to the ways of
the Lord, 2. Chron. 17. 6. And of Hezechia it is said, that in all the works
he began for the service of the house of God, to seek his god, he did it with
all his heart and prospered, 2. Chron. 31. 31. And of Josiah, that he turned to
the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might. 2.
King. 23. 25. They maintained and held out the profession and practice of Gods
pure Religion with great zeal and earnestness of affection.

The Reasons and grounds of the Doctrine are principally three. Reason. 1.


1. Every one that looks to be saved by Christ, must be a follower of Christ,
He that says he abides in him (says the Apostle, 1. John 2. 6.) must
himself walk also, even as he walked. The best evidence that we can have,
that we remain in him, is when we are conformed unto his example, and by his
spirit made like unto him. 2. The Lord cannot abide such as 2.
serve him without zeal. This is plain by that speech of Christ to the
Laodiceans, Reu. 3. 16. 1. He professes that he likes not so ill of him that
is cold, that is an Idolater or a worldling, a man of no Religion, as he does
of the Christian that is lukewarm: 2. That he will spue such a one out of his
mouth; yea he threatens the Church of Ephesus, that because she had lost her
first love, her zeal that once she had, he would come against her shortly, and
remove her candlestick, if she did not repent and amend this fault. Reu. 2.
5. 3. The Spirit of God is said to be like unto fire, in all them that have
received it, and from thence comes that speech, quench not the spirit, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 19. And all that are regenerated by the Spirit of Christ, are said to
3.
be baptized with the Holy Ghost, and with fire, Matthew. 3. 11. and where fire
is, there must needs be some heat.

The Use of this Doctrine is.

1. To convince a great error in judgment that is common in the world. Use 1.
We see this is held as a perfect definition of a good Protestant, that he is a
man found in judgment, and in the knowledge of the truth, but not forward nor
zealous either in the profession or practice of it: yea it is counted the
wisdom of a Christian, and even of a Minister too, to be a moderate man in
Religion, not forward, nor hot, nor zealous in it. Whereas we have heard, that
such as are regenerate, and have Gods Spirit, cannot be without this heat and
zeal: 2. That in Gods account, neither Papist nor Turk is in so bad an
estate, in some respect, as the Gospeller is that is void of zeal: 3. That God
has threatened to deprive them of the Gospel that profess it without zealous
love unto it.

2. To exhort us to examine our selves well whether there be any true zeal in
us, yea or no, that if we want it, we may be humbled and seek 2.
to God for it, if we have had it, and now begin to wax cold, and to decay in
it, we may strive against our coldness and lukewarmenesse, and labor to
recover our selves, and to stir up that good gift of God that is ready to
dye. If we have it, we may be thankful to God for it, and strive to nourish
and maintain it by all good means. And for our help herein: I will show you
the properties of true zeal, as they are described unto us in this example of
our Savior here, which we are bound to imitate and conform our selves unto.

He that has true zeal, serves God desirously and willingly. He gladly takes,
and will not let slip any opportunity of doing good. That 1. Prop.
was one cause why our Savior says here, it was his meat to do his Fathers
will. It is usual (we know) in Scriptures, to express an earnest desire we
have or should have to any thing, by the Metaphor of hunger and thirst, Matthew.
5. 6. as we say in our Proverb, we would do such a thing as willingly as we
would eat, when we are hungry.

Let us that are Ministers examine our selves by this.

1. A Minister can have no good assurance, that God ever called him, or will
work with him, unless he can find that the thing that moved him to enter
into this calling, was an earnest desire to do good in it: If any man desire
the office of a Bishop (says the Apostle, 1. Tim. 3. 1.) he desires a good
work. It is true indeed, that the best of Gods servants have been at the
first exceedingly unwilling and backward; but before they have entered upon
this function, they have been made by Gods Spirit maruellously willing and
desirous to be employed in it. When the Prophet Esaias (who had been a little
before greatly dejected in the sense of his own unworthiness and unfitness
to this function, Esaias 6. 5.) heard the Lord say, verse 8. Whom shall I send?
or who shall go for us? then I said (says he) here am I, send me. By this
property Moses knew them, whom God had called and fitted for the building of
the Tabernacle, Exodus 36, 2. He called Bezaliel and Aholiab, and every one
whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it. Yea, this zealous
desire to do good must be in a Minister at all times, when he goes about the
Lords work; he must go to it as willingly, as he goes to his meat, when he
is hungry, Feed the Flock of God (says the Apostle, 1. Pet. 5. 2.) and care
for it, not by constraint, but willingly, not for filthy lucre, but of a ready
mind. The servant of the Lord (says Paul, 2. Tim. 2. 24.) must be apt to
teach; yea say a man preach diligently and constantly, yet if he do it not
willingly, if the thing that mooues him to it, be not this desire to do good,
he can expect no blessing upon his labors. Though I preach the Gospel (says
he, 1. Cor. 9. 16. 17.) I have nothing to glory of, if I do this thing
willingly I have a reward. Behold then one chief cause, why the Ministry of
the Word does so little good in many places, and is so unfruitful, as if the
Lord had even commanded the clouds to rain no more upon it, as he speaks,
Esaias 5. 12. Surely, many that have excellent gifts, have had other ends in
entering into this calling; the desire they had to do this worthy work, moved
them not to be Ministers. And therefore seeing the Lord never sent them, what
marvel is it, though he work not with them? yea this should make the best of
us ashamed, for that we have been no more apt to teach; but have gone so
heavily about the Lords work, as if we had done it by constraint only. To
this (certainly) we may impute the small fruit of our labors; and therefore
we should hereafter labor and strive against it.

2. By this property also must every one of Gods people try themselves, even by
that willingness and unfeigned desire that is in them to serve God, and to
enlarge his kingdom.

The faithful are often described by this property, and have rejoiced and found
comfort in this, that though their ability to do God service has been
slender, yet they have had an earnest desire to do it: their desire and will
has been far above their ability this way. I desired to do thy will O my
God, says David, Psalm. 40. 8. and the Church, Esaias 26. 8. The desire of our
soul is to thy name. Hearken (says he, Neh. 1. 11.) to the prayer of thy
servants that desire to fear thy name. We should go to prayer, to the hearing
and reading of the Word, and to every duty of Gods service, as willingly and
desirously as we go to our meat, when we are hungry. Thy people come willingly
(says the Prophet, Psalm. 110. 3.) At the time of assembling we should think
often of that which the Apostle says, (...). Cor. 8. 12. If there be first a
willing mind, a man is accepted. And who is there that may not justly blame
himself in this? we do all things in Gods service, as by constraint, and are
haled to them, as the Bear to the stake. Well, learn to acknowledge this to
be thy great corruption, bewail it, and strive against it.

Lecture the seven and fiftieth, July 10. 1610. JOHN IIII. XXXII, XXXIV.
Follows the 2. Property of true zeal. He that has true zeal, takes
delight, 2. Prop.
and finds comfort in serving God. This is a second reason (as we have heard)
why Christ calls it here his meat to do his Fathers will. Meat (by the
ordinary blessing of God) satisfies a man, and comfort him; it refreshes
and reuiueth his spirits: When Jonathan (having been long fasting) had eaten a
little, his eyes received sight, 1. Sam. 14. 27. And it is said of the poor
Egyptian servant, that had neither eat nor drunk in three days, that when
David had given him somewhat to eat, 1. Sam. 30. 12. his spirit came again to
him. And therefore Christ calls this here his meat, because it even did him
good, satisfied, refreshed, and delighted him maruailously to do the will of
him that sent him; no food, no dainties were so sweet unto him. This is that
that Solomon speaks, Pro. 21. 15. It is joy to the just to do judgment.

True it is, that the best of Gods servants want this joy and gladness of
heart in Gods service, sometimes; and that is the cause why that prayer is so
often used, 2. Chron. 6. 4. Let thy Saints rejoice in goodness, Psalm. 7. 11.
Let them that love thy name, be joyful in thee, Psalm. 70. 4. Let all those
that seek thee, be glad and rejoice in thee. But this is 1. Only in the time
of tentation, when the light of Gods countenance is hidden from them, and they
want the feeling of his favor: 2. It is but from the flesh and unregenerate
part, that they are so uncomfortable; for in this case they may say with Paul,
Romans 7. 22. I delight in the Law of God after the inward man: whereof this is a
sign, that they are not satisfied with ought they do in Gods service, if they
feel not joy and comfort in it. And whatsoever they do, if they feel they do
it with an upright heart they rejoice in it, as they did, 1. Chron. 29. 9. This
you shall find observed by the Holy Ghost, and commended in Gods servants, as
a notable sign of their zeal, and of the vprightnes of their hearts, that
Gods service was as meat and drink unto them, they took great comfort and
delight in it. David reports that he and the rest of Gods people with him, were
wont to go toward Gods house, With the voice of singing and praise, as a
multitude that keeps a feast, Psalm. 42. 4. And so he stirs up all Gods
people to do, Psalm 120. 2. Serve the Lord with gladness, come before him with
ioyfulnesse. So it is said of every part of Gods service, that Gods people have
found joy and comfort in it. Of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob it is said, Heb. 11.
1^. That when God preached the Gospel and the promises of salvation by Christ
unto them, they received them thankefully, saluted and welcomed them, they
ioyed in them. And of three thousand that Peter converted, it is said, Acts 2.
4^. That they received the word gladly. That hearer hears with zeal, that can
do so.

It is said likewise of the faithful that they found great comfort and joy in
prayer. It is said of David, that as in all his heaviness and extremity, his
manner was to betake himself to prayer, Psalm. 109. 4 so that he was wont to
find exceeding joy and comfort in it; when he makes mention how in his great
affliction, he betook himself to prayer, Psalm. 30. 8, 9, 10. He tells us,
verse 11. what comfort he found in it, Thou have turned for me my mourning into
dancing, thou have put of my sackcloath, and girded me with gladness,
according to that promise made unto the faithful, Esaias. 56. 7. I will make
them joyful in my house of prayer.

Thus have they ioyed also in the receiving of the Sacrament, 2. Chron. 30. 21.
They kept the feast of unleavened bread with great gladness, which is also
again repeated ver. 25, 26. The like is also reported of the Passover that
was kept in Ezraes time, Ezra 6. 22. they kept the feast of unleavened bread
with joy, for the Lord had made them joyful.

Yea even in giving of alms for the relief of Gods servants, the faithful
have found great joy. Thus the Apostle reports of the Macedonians, 2. Cor. 8.
2. In great trial of affliction their joy abounded, and their most extreme
poverty abounded unto their rich liberality. It was a great comfort unto them,
that God had given them a heart to show such love unto his Saints.

To conclude, this is observed to the praise of Gods servants, that as they
were wont to come to Gods house as to a feast, so were they also wont to go
away from it as from a feast, refreshed and comforted in their souls. They
found such sound and lasting comfort in Gods House, and in all the parts of
Gods worship, as they were wont to go from it with joy. And the comfort they
found in it, wrought in them a love unto it, and a desire to frequent it often.
It is said of Gods people, Neh. 8. 12. that after Gods service was finished,
they showed a great deal of joy, because they had understood the words that
had been declared unto them by the Levites. And when David professes, Psol.
84. 1, 2. That his soul: longed, and even fainted for the Courts of the Lord,
his heart and his flesh cried out for the living God. He gives this for the
reason of it, because he had found such sweetness and comfort in Gods worship
and ordinances there, Oh how amiable (says he) are thy Tabernacles O Lord of
Hosts.

The Use of all this that has been said of this second property of true
zeal, is 1. For reproof. Is this a note of one that serves God with true
zeal, Use (...).
when the service of God is as meat and drink unto him? when it does him good
at the heart, and even refreshes him, he finds joy and comfort in it? Then
surely have we all cause of shame and humbling, cause to suspect that we are no
better then Laodiceans, lukewarm Professors, of whom I told you the last day,
that they are in some respect in worse state then such as are key-cold, then
Idolaters and men of no Religion. Do we come to Gods House as to a feast?
Truly some do, some go further to a Sermon, and with more gladness of heart
then ever they did to a feast. But the most go to Gods house as unto ward
children go to School; or as malefactors that are under bail, go unto the
Assizes; they must needs go, but they go with no joy. 2. Can we say we have
found comfort in every part of Gods service? many cannot tarry till all be
done, but by their going out, proclaim to the whole Congregation, that they
account it a weariness and most tedious thing, like those, Mal. 1. 13. 2. And
of many of them that tarry it out, it may be said that the trial of their
countenance testifies against them, that they hear with no joy, they are so
drowsy, they look so heavily, as a man may easily discern by their very
looks, that they feel no sweetness nor savor in any thing that they hear.
It is said of a poor lame man, Acts 14. 9. that he heard Paul preach with so
joyful and cheerful a countenance, that Paul beholding him, perceived by his
very countenance, that he had faith to be healed. True it is, that Paul could
see further then any of us, yet may we also give a great guess, when you hear
with any spirit and affection, even by your looks, and have cause given us
thereby, many times to wish, that either you would hear with more
cheerfulness, or that you would sit behind us, that you may not grieve and
discourage us, in the work of our Ministry as you do. 3. A third sign, that
many take no co^ in Gods Word, is this, that (whereas Gods servants as we have
heard, use to go away from the hearing of the Word more comfortable, then they
came unto it, and love (...) it, and the messengers of God, from whom they
received it, much (...) then they did before) these men seldom or never go
from (...), but they are much more vexed and disquieted in their mi^ (...) they
were before, they hate the Preacher more then they did (...) Now I would have
these men to consider what it is that disqui^ (...): I know they will pretend,
that the Minister has either (...) (...) error, or that he has maliciously
girded, and rayled upon the^ (...) ^urely if any Preacher do so, he shall
bear his condemnation, If (...) (says the Apostle, 1. Pet. 4 11. let him
speak as the oracles of God. (...) is usually a slander. Many will object
against the Preacher thus, I know he meant me: yea he so^spake, as many in the
Church knew he meant me: and what call you this but malice? if he had loved
me, he would have told me in private. To these men I say: 1. A Minister is not
bound in reproouing sin to beat the air, but he may in his reproves mean
and intend to touch such as hear him: yea it is his duty to bring his doctrine
home as particularly as he can to the conscience of every one that hears him,
like a good steward to give unto every one his own portion, Luke 12. 42.

2. Admit he had spoken out of malice, yet if he have spoken nothing but upon
good warrant of Gods Word, and thy heart be so disquieted by it, surely thy
case is fearful; Gods people have ever been wont to find comfort in his
Word, even in that part of it, that has most galled them, by discovering to
them their sins: Let the righteous smite me (says David, Psalm. 141. 5.) it
shall be a kindness, and let him reprove me, it shall be as an excellent
oil. And thy heart tells thee, thou feel no comfort in it, but it vexes
thee so, that were it not for such and such an alehouse, where thou may
find company of thine own mind; that will take thy part in railing and
scorning of the Preacher, thou should not know what to do; surely thy case
is fearful? If thou had any grace in thy heart, the Word of God would not
be so bitter unto thee. Do not my words (says the Lord, Mic. 2. 7.) do good
to him that walks uprightly. Do they not do him good at the heart, do they
not cheer and comfort him? and because thou may the better discern of thine
own case in another man's person then in thine own, I will show thee in a few
examples what thy state is. Cain was such a one as thou art: for he because he
could not be as well accepted, as well thought on for his Religion as his
brother was, Genesis 4. 5. went away from Gods worship in a rage, and hi^
countenance fell down. Ahab was such a one as thou art, for he because Eliah
and Micaiah dealt faithfully with him in their Ministry, and effectually
discovered to him his sins, went never from their Ministry, but with a
discontented and vexed heart, he counted them his enemies, and hated them, 1.
King. 21. ^0. and 22. 8. The man that was possessed with a Legion of devils was
in thy case, for he being in the Synagogue where Christ preached, was tormented
by his Ministry, Luke 4. 33, 34. Mar. 5. 79. Though Christ had not spoken to
him in particular ever a word, or once meddled with him. Finally the cursed
Jews that stoned blessed Stephen to death were in thy case, for when they
heard Stephen, Acts 7. 54. They were cut to the heart, and they gnashed upon
him with their teeth.

Lastly, this serves to discover the sin of such as are always discontented
with the length of the Sabbath, and grudge that the Lord should have one whole
day in a week allowed unto him: That would have the Sabbath day but four
hours long at the most, even no longer then the time is that is spent at
Church upon that day. That say in their hearts, as Amos 8. 5. When will the
Sabbath be done, that we may set forth wheat, making the Ephah small and the
Shekell great, and with them, Mal. 1. 3. Behold what a wearines is it* What a
tedious thing is it to keep a Sabbath for a whole day? whereas God has
expressly commanded, Exodus 20. 10. That on the seventh (...) should do no manner
of work, but keep it holy unto him, (...) given six days to do all that we
have to do in, and even on the Sabbath (on his own seventh part of the week)
allowed us to do works of present necessity. And what is the true cause why
the Sabbath seems to us so long a day above any other? Surely because we take
no delight in it, nor in the works and duties of it: we do not call the
Sabbath a delight; as we ought to do, Esaias 58. 1^.

The second Use, that this which we have heard of the second property 2.
of (...) zeal serves unto, is to exhort all Gods servants to strive against
that vncheerefulnesse that they are so much subject unto, and to labor to
serve God with joy and gladness of heart: Say unto thy soul as David did,
Psalm 42. 11. Why art thou so heavy O my soul, and why art thou so disquieted
within me. Know thou, that even when thou have most cause to be humbled and
dejected in thy self through any affliction, either outward or inward, yet
even then thou art bound to strive against thy vncheerefulnesse, when thou
go to do any service unto God, even in thy trembling thou should
rejoice, Psalm. 2. 11.

Consider with thy self how great reason thou have to do so.

1. No service pleases God so well, as that which his people do perform
cheerfully and with joy, Deuteronomy. 28. 47, 48. Because thou seruedst not the Lord
thy God with ioyfulnesse and with gladness of heart for the abundance of all
things, therefore thou shall serve thine enemies which the Lord shall send
against thee.

2. The Lord is not so strict and severe, as to reject the service that with a
good heart we do unto him, for the infirmities and failings that he does
discern in it, but delights in it notwithstanding, Let me hear thy voice, for
sweet is thy voice, Cant. 2. 14. And this is a just cause of encouragement to
all that fear God, not only to do service unto him, but to do it
cheerfully and with gladness of heart. As for me (says David, Psalm. 5. 7.) I
will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy, and 130. 3. 4. If thou
Lord should mark iniquities, O Lord who should stand? But there is
forgiveness with thee that thou may be feared.

3. Thou have cause to doubt the soundness of thy heart, if thou can find
no sweetness nor comfort in Gods Word and worship, for of the godly and
vpright-hearted it is often noted, that the Word of God was sweeter to them then
the honey or the honey comb, Psalm. 9. 10. That they rejoiced, because with an
upright heart they had offered willingly unto the Lord, 1. Chron. 29. 9. The
righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and shall trust in him, and all the
upright in heart shall glory, Psalm. 64. 10.

Lecture the eight and fiftieth, July 17. 1610. JOHN IIII. XXXII, XXXIV.
Follows the third Property of true zeal to be observed in this example of
our blessed Savior. He that has true zeal, rejoices in the zeal and
forwardness of others: For this was (as we heard) one cause that made our
Savior to forget both hunger and thirst at this time, even the joy that he
conceived, in foreseeing the readiness and forwardness of the Samaritanes, in
coming unto him at this motion, and persuasion of the Woman. And this he more
plainly expresses in that speech which he used to his Disciples verse 35.
Lift up your eyes, and look on the regions, for they are white already unto
harvest. See this truth confirmed by the example of others of Gods servants in
five degrees.

1. They have ioyed greatly in the grace that they have seen in others. Thus
did the Apostle John, 2. John 4. I rejoiced greatly, that I found of thy
children walking in the truth, and 3. John 4. I have no greater joy then to
hear that my sons walk in verity.

2. They have held themselves bound to give hearty thanks to God for this;
even as if they had themselves received some great benefit by it: Thus Paul,
Ephesians. 1. 16. after he had heard of their faith and love, he ceased not to
give thanks for them. The like we shall find, Phil. 4. 1, 3. and Philemon 4.
Yea he professes, 1 Thessalonians. 3. 9. that he was so affected with joy for this,
that he knew not how to be sufficiently thankful unto God for it. And that
being in great affliction, the good tidings that Timothy brought him of the
piety he found among the Thessalonians, did even comfort and revive him, 1 Thessalonians. 3. 6, 7.

3. Yea (above all the graces they have discerned in others) they have most
rejoiced, and praised God for this, when they have seen men zealous and
forward. David professes, that the more any of the Saints did excel in grace,
the more he delighted in them, Psalm. 16. 3. Paul when he had said that he,
Siluanus and Timothy, ought always to praise God for the Thessalonians, gives
this for the reason, because their faith did grow exceedingly, 2 Thessalonians. 1. 3.

4. They have been wont to rejoice, not only for the grace they have
discerned, in such as have been converted by their own Ministry (for this
might grow from self-love, because 1. That the good we know, we have done by
our Ministry, is our best defense against wicked men, Satan and our own
conscience, 1 Cor. 9. 2, 3. 2. The more good we have done, the more grace men
have received by our Ministry, the greater shall our reward be, he that (by
employing his pound) gained unto his master five pounds, was made ruler over
five cities, Luke. 19. 19. and he that gained ten, over ten cities, Luke 19.
17. 19. And the Apostle professes that the Thessalonians that were won to God
by his Ministry, were his hope, and joy, and crown of rejoicing even in the
presence of Christ, 1 Thessalonians. 2. 19.) but they have rejoiced thus in the grace
they have seen or heard of in any others, As Paul does in that grace that was
in the Romans, Romans 1. 8. and 16. 19 and in the Colossians, Col. 1. 3.

5. Yea they have done thus; when themselves (in the judgment of flesh and
blood) have become loosers by it; when the forwardness and zeal of others
could not choose but tend (in some sort) to their own disgrace, yet they have
rejoiced in it. This was a notable trial of their zeal. When Moses (that had
been the only Prophet and man of fame in Gods Church) sees Eldad and Medad
(obscure men) receive of the same spirit that himself had, prophesy as well as
himself, have every whit as good a gift, and likely to be as well thought of
in the Church as himself (if not better) he was never a whit discontented at
it (though Joshua enuyed this himself, and provoked him to do so too) but he
rejoiced at it and checked Joshua, and wished that all the Lords people were
Prophets as well as he, Numb. 11. 29. It is to a carnal Professor, a matter
of great coffeehouse, when he sees such as were very lewd before, become as
forward in Religion as himself, that has professed the Gospel many years;
or when he sees such as are young, and newly crept out of the shell, as
forward as himself. Nothing fretted the wicked Jews so much as this, when
they heard Paul say he had a calling from God to preach to the Gentiles, they
cried, Away with such a fellow from the earth, for it is not fit that he
should live, Acts 22. 21, 22. This was that, that vexed the elder brother of
the Prodigal son, Luke 15. 28, 29. So when the chief Priests and Scribes
saw the children so zealous, and heard them cry Hosanna the son of David,
they disdained, Matthew 21. 15. But there is a quite contrary disposition in all
that truly fear God; they count it no disparagement to see any (how young
soever they be, how wicked soever they have been) to become as forward in
goodness as themselves, but they rejoice in it. Paul and Barnabas in every
place as they went, between Antioch and Jerusalem, declared to the believing
Jews, the conversion of the Gentiles (as the best news they could bring them)
and it is said, they brought thereby great joy to all the brethren, Acts 15. 3.
Yea Gods servants have been wont to rejoice to see others more forward then
themselves; yea though they have been their inferiors. See this in David, He
was glad when the people provoked him unto forwardness, and said unto him, Let
us go into the House of the Lord, Psalm. 122. 1. And John Baptist, when he saw
his hearers grow so forward and zealous, that his Ministry would not content
them, but they left him, and went to Christ; yet (because he saw they went
forward, they went to Christ) it never troubled him, he never rated them for
it, (no though he were provoked to it by some that were a little too jealous of
his credit, Ioh. 3. 26.) but he rejoiced in it, and verse 24. This (he says)
fulfilled his joy.

The Use of this point is first for trial and examination of every one of Use
1.
our hearts. If we profess the truth and be but lukewarm, have no zeal, we
are in worse case then they that are stark cold. Let us try by this property,
whether there be any zeal in us or no. Do we thus rejoice in the grace we see
in others? does it do us good to see or hear of the increase of Gods Church?
Do we thank God for it? Do we delight in a man, and love him the more, the
more forward and zealous he is? Surely, the most of us will hardly be able to
find this in our selves: yea many are so far from that; as they disdain to
see others forwarder then themselves, and fret at nothing so much, as at the
zeal they see in others. The only true cause of that hatred many bear to
Gods people, is their zeal, because they follow goodness, Psalm 38. 30. Many
have that accursed humor in them which Sanballat is noted for, Neh. 4. 1. He
was angry and sore grieved to see the walls of Jerusalem builded. And they fret
to see Gods Church grow and increase.

See this humor also in the wretched Pharisees; the peoples zeal in following
Christ vexed them, and was the chief cause of their practices against him,
Mark 11. 18. They sought how they might destroy him, for they feared him
because all the people were astonished at his doctrine.

The second Use shall be to resolve us in a case of conscience, that concerns
2.
many of you; what we are to think of the people that go from their own
Pastors to hear others.

This I had occasion to speak of, not long since; but I was not well
understood then by some; and therefore intend now to deliver my See Lect. 54.
mind more fully and plainly for the resolving of this doubt. And to this
purpose, somewhat must be said, First, to the people that use to leave their
own Pastors: 2. To the Pastors that are so left by their people.

To the people I say: 1. If thy own Pastor be a man whose gift is approved
by Gods Church, and one who is conscionable in his place, and of Cautio^s.
unblameable life; though his gifts be far inferior to some others; yet take
heed thou leave him not at any time with contempt of his Ministry. And then
thou contemnest his Ministry when thou speak or think thus in thy heart,
alas he is no body, a good honest man, but he has no gifts, I cannot profit by
him. Mark the reasons why you may not do this: 1. A man may be a true
Minister, though his gifts be far inferior to many others, Matthew. 25. 15.
The Lord gave to one of his servants five Talents, to another but two, to
another but one.

The Apostle uses this as a reason to persuade all the members of the Church
to unity, that they of meaner gifts might not envy them that had better, nor
they of better gifts despise them that had meaner, Ephesians 4. 7. To every one
of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.

2. If thy Pastor be a true Minister of Christ, and can preach the Gospel in
any true measure, thou art bound to love him, and reverence him, and thank God
for him. By this reason Paul commends Timothy to the Church of Corinth, 1.
Cor. 16. 10. If he come to you, let him be without fear (take heed you wrong
him not, disgrace him not) for he works the work of the Lord even as I do,
as well as I. This is that the Apostle speaks, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 13. Have them in
singular love for their works sake, and Romans 10. 15. If he bring to us the
glad tidings of peace, the glad tidings of good things, his feet must be
beautiful in our eyes. On the other side, the contempt done to the Ministry of
the meanest of Gods servants, reaches unto Christ himself, Luke 10. 16. he
that despises you despises me.

3. If thy Pastor be a true Minister of Christ, and have received a gift, then
(doubtless) thou may profit by him, if the fault be not in thy self, 1.
Cor. 12. 7. The manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit
withal, and ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may
be comforted, 1. Cor. 14. 3^. The best Christian that is, may profit by the
meanest of Gods servants. Paul professes this was one cause why he so
earnestly desired to come to the Romans, that he might receive some good, some
increase of faith even from them, Romans 1. 12. And I am persuaded, there is
never a Minister, that is of the most excellent gifts (if he have a godly
heart) but he can truly say, he never heard any faithful Minister in his
life, that was so mean, but he could discern some gift in him, that was
wanting in himself, and could receive some profit by him.

4. The fruit and profit that is to be received from the Ministry, depends not
only, nor chiefly upon the gifts of the man that preaches, but upon the
blessing, that God is pleased to give unto his own ordinance. Who then is
Paul? and who is Apollo? but Ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord
gave to every man. I have planted, Apollo watered, but God gave the increase.
So then, neither is he that planted any thing, nor he that waters, but God
that gives the increase. Now he that planteth, and he that waters are one,
1. Corinthians 3. 5, 6, 7, 8. And God does often give a greater blessing to
weaker then to stronger means, as we have heard not long since. So that thou
must depend upon God for his blessing on his ordinance, rather then upon the
gifts of the teacher. And consider, the fault Lect. 54.
may be rather in thy self, then in thy teacher, that thou can not profit.
And indeed how is it possible, thou should profit by his Ministry, if thou
come with prejudice, without any reverence and delight unto it, and do
scarce acknowledge Gods ordinance in it, nor ever seek to God for his blessing
upon it.

Secondly, no Christian may usually and ordinarily leave his own Pastor (who
is so qualified, as in the beginning of the first caution is set down) to 2.
hear another of better gifts; for 1. As it is the ordinance of God, that
every Pastor should have his own flock to attend, and take heed unto, the
Apostles ordained Elders in every congregation, Act. 14. 23. (neither is that
excuse of some ought worth, that they are not tied to one Parish, but Ministers
of the Church of England, so as wheresoever they are, they cannot justly be
called non-residents from their flock) so is it Gods ordinance, that every one
of Gods people, should have a Pastor of his own to depend upon, 1. Pet. 5. 3.
Now he cannot be said to depend upon his Pastors Ministry, that does ordinarily
and usually leave it, and go to another.

2. It is also Gods ordinance (as it is agreeable to good order) that
Christians should be distinguished, and sorted into Congregations, according to
their dwellings; that they that dwell next together, should be of the same
Congregation, and from hence the name Paroichia first came. This may appear by
the general equity of that rule, God is not the author of confusion, but of
peace, as in all Churches of the Saints, and let all things be done decently
and in order, 1 Cor. 14. 33. 40. and specially by that we read, that Paul left
Titus in Creta, to ordain Elders in every city, they that lived together in
the same town, should be under the charge of the same Elder, Tit. 1. 5. He
only makes right use of the benefit of hearing such as have more excellent
gifts then his own Pastor, as learneth thereby to like his own Pastor the
better, and to profit more by him. The excellent gifts God has bestowed on
others in this case, may fitly be resembled unto Physic. They use Physic
well, and are blessed in the use of it, whose appetite is amended, and who are
by it made able to relish and like their ordinary food the better; but they who
use it so often, as that their stomach is thereby overthrown, and they made
unable to feed on their ordinary food, abuse this good ordinance of God, and
find not his blessing, but his curse in it. So do many abuse this, that they
should use as Physic for their soul. After they have heard a while, a man of
excellent gifts; they begin to distaste the Ministry of their ordinary
Pastors; and can like of none, profit by none, unless they be of rare and
excellent gifts: yea they become at length like unto those, who by accustoming
themselves, to drink hot and strong waters, bring their stomach to that
pass, that they can find no relish in any drink or water be it never so hot
or strong.

3. He that leaves his own Pastor to hear another, must be careful 3.
to approve his heart to God, that he seek nothing in it but sound
edification only, he goes to the other only, because he finds he can
profit in knowledge, or faith, or sanctification, by him more, then by his own
Pastor. This caution will be found very necessary, if we consider the great
want of judgment that appears in Christians, in the choice they make of
their teachers, and applause they give unto them. Some admire and follow
another, rather then their own Pastor, because he can make more ostentation
of eloquence, and reading, and learning, and such like humane gifts; then their
own Pastor does. So the Corinthians preferred sundry teachers they had before
Paul, which makes him enter into these terms of comparison, and commendation
of his own gifts, I suppose, I was not a whit behind the very chief Apostles;
But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been
thoroughly made manifest to you in all things, 2. Cor. 11. 5, 6. Some leave
their own Pastor, and go to others, only for varieties sake. Say their own
have never so excellent gifts, yet can they not like any one man long, they
have itching ears, and must have an heap of teachers, 2. Timothy 4. 3. Some
prefer others before their own Pastors, only because they show more zeal
in their, voice, and gesture, and phrase of speech, and manner of delivery;
though (happily) the Doctrine it self be nothing so wholesome, or powerful, or
fit to edify their conscience, as the Doctrine of their own Pastor is.
These, though they be the best of the three sorts, and pretend much love and
zeal, yet we may wish to them more knowledge and judgment, as the Apostle
does, I pray (says he) that your love may abound more and more in knowledge
and in all judgment, Philippians 1. 9. Some dislike their own Pastor,
because (as he knows them better then a stranger, so) he uses in his
Ministry to meet oftener with them, then a stranger can do, which is indeed a
chief thing wherein the faithfulness of a Minister may be seen, Preach the
Word (says the Apostle) be instant in season, and out of season, reprove,
rebuke, exhort, 2. Timothy 4. 3. and for this cause they hate him as Ahab did
Eliah and Micaiah, (...). Kings 22. 8. and 2^. 20.

4. When thou do leave thine own Pastor and go to another, though thou
do it in uprightness of heart, only in a desire to edify thy 4.
self, yet must thou seek to do it with the consent, and good leave and
liking of thine own Pastor: for 1. Thou must acknowledge that by Gods
ordinance thou ow^st a duty to him, as to thy superior, in the things that
belong to thy soul, Know them which labor among you and are over you in the
Lord, (...). These 5. 1^. 2. Thou art bound to seek his comfort, and to give
him all good encouragement, that he may do the work of his Ministry with joy
and cheerfulness, Heb. 13. 17. And these are the cautions which the hearer
that would with comfort, and Gods allowance, leave his own Pastor to hear
another, must observe.

Now to those Pastors that are thus left of their people, three directions I
have to give.

1. If thou know any that (out of a factious humor, and in contempt of thy
Ministry without a sincere respect to his edification) does leave thee, thou
may lawfully dislike, and think ill of him, and reproo^e him sharply,
neither art thou bound to think well of him, till he have showed himself
penitent for this his offense, if he turn again to thee saying, I repent,
thou shall forgive him. Luke 1^. ^4.

2. Seek to draw them back unto thee, and to hold them, by increasing thy
diligence in thy Ministry, and labor to teach more profitably. Follow that
direction that is given, Cause them to hear thee. How shall that be? Not by
presenting them, and troubling them, but by searching forth and preparing many
parables, by seeking to find out pleasant words and an upright writing, even
the words of truth as Solomon speaks Eccles. 12. 9. that is, Show thy self
painful in study, and careful to come so prepared to the work of thy
Ministry, that thou may teach soundly and profitably: Hea ken to the
exhortation Paul gives to Timothy, 1. Tim (...). 13. Give attendance to
reading first, then to exhortation and doctrine. As if he should say, That thou
may be able to exhort and teach, study hard, Verse 14. Despise not the gift
that is in thee: as if he should say, Suffer it not by idleness to decay, but
stir it up, nourish and increase it, Verse 15. These things exercise, and
give thy self unto them, that it may be seen how thou profitest among all
men: as if he should say, Strive so to teach, as it may appear thy gifts
increase daily. When the Apostle fore-telleth, that in these latter times men
should have itching ears, and should after their own lusts, get them an heap
of Teachers, 2. Timothy 4. 2, 3. he prescribes to Timothy this remedy to cure
it, Preach the Word, be instant in season and out of season, improoue, rebuke,
exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine: as if he should say, Teach
diligently, teach zealously, teach profitably, using not only doctrine, but
application, grounding thy exhortations and reproves substantially upon sound
doctrine Gods people in these days are past children, neither is it sufficient
for a Minister, to give them that food, that in it self is wholesome and good;
but they must give them that food, that is fit for their age and condition, for
some, milk is fit food, for some stronger meat, 1. Corinthians. 2. As it is a
shame for a people, that have had good means of growth, to be unable to bear
strong meat, and to stand still in need of milk, Heb. (...). 12. so is it a
great shame for a Teacher, to have nothing but milk to set before his people,
that are able to bear, and stand in need of strong meat. He that in these
days would approve himself to be a Scribe, taught to the Kingdom of God,
(fitted of God for the work of the Ministry) must be like unto the householder,
which has a treasury of good provision in himself, and brings forth of it
things both old and new, Matthew. 13. 52.

This I thought needful to stand upon, because I find, that those Ministers
of all others, are most vehement and bitter in complaining of their people for
going from them, who are either utterly unable to teach profitably, and take
upon them to fly, before they have wings; or such as are idle men, and make no
conscience to stir up that gift, that God has bestowed upon them.

3. The last direction I have to give to such Pastors, is this, That if they
see cause to judge, that such as leave them sometimes, do it without contempt
of their Ministry, in a dutiful manner, seeking nothing in it but their profit
and growth in grace, and that they do indeed profit by another more than they
did by themselves, that they are much bettered in knowledge, zealous love to
the Word, reformation of life, conscience of all their ways, since they went
to hear such a man; then take heed thou repine not at it, but rejoice
heartily, that this work is wrought in them, though not by thy self. Remember
the doctrine that thou have now heard: Yea, say they were such as left thee
with some contempt, yet if they profit more by another than by thee, thou
should be willing to take knowledge of the good things that are even in
thine enemy, and to rejoice in them also. The Corinthians began to despise
Paul's Ministry, and to entertain false Apostles, that sought to disgrace him;
and yet does he take knowledge of the good things were in them, and praises
God for them also, 1 Cor. 1. 4, 5. The like example he gives us also, he
rejoices that Christ was preached even by them, who (though they had good
gifts, and did both for matter and method, teach profitably, yet) had naughty
hearts, and preached out of envy and desire to add affliction unto his bonds,
Phil. 1. 15, 16, 18.

Lecture the fiftieth ninth, June 24. 1610. JOHN IIII. XXXII -- XXXIV.
Follows the fourth Property of true zeal, to be observed in this example
of our blessed Savior. Though he had spent much time already in instructing
the Woman, yet (as if he had done nothing hitherto) he earnestly desires to do
more: Yea, he professes it was his meat, to finish and perfect his fathers
work. He that has true zeal, will not rest in any thing he has already
done, but will still endeavor to go forward, and to be better than he has
been, and to finish his work well. Two branches there are (you see) of this
property:

1. He that has any true zeal in him, is careful to grow, and go forward:
there is no one more essential property of true zeal, than this desire to
grow. See a plain example of this in Paul, he had attained to a great measure,
and done much service to God, yet hear what he says, Phil. 3. 13, 14. I count
not my self that I have attained to perfection: but one thing I do (as if he
should say, This is all my perfection) I forget that that is behind, and
endeavor my self to that which is before, and follow hard toward the mark.
There is no certainer a sign, that a man has saving grace in him, than this,
when he earnestly desires and endeavors to have more grace. They that have
had most store of grace, have ever been most covetous, and greedy to get more;
as none are so desirous of riches, as they that have most wealth, nor any so
desirous of knowledge, as the best learned. It is made a title of the servants
of God, to hunger and thirst after righteousness, Matthew. 5. (...). See an
experiment of this in David, how he hungered after the saving knowledge of Gods
will, Open thou mine eyes (says he) that I may behold wondrous things out of
thy Law. Teach me thy statutes; make me to understand the way of thy precepts,
Psalm 119. 18. 26, 27.

2. His chief care is to finish his work well. This we may see in Paul, Acts
20. 24. I pass not at all, I care not what I endure, so I may fulfill my
course with joy. And it is noted by the Holy Ghost, of the best of Gods
servants, that they never showed such zeal and faithfulness in the work of
the Lord, as when they were near their end, when they saw, they were not to
continue long. Jacob, Moses, Joshua, David, Peter, showed more care of the
Church, and zeal of Gods glory toward their end, than ever they did before.
Yea, our Savior was never so zealous and painful in instructing and praying
for his Disciples, as he was a little before his death, See what he says of
this, Ioh. 9. 4. I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day;
the night comes when no man can work. And see what he did also, how he
doubled his diligence in preaching and praying for his Church immediately
before his Passion. In the day time (every day) he was teaching in the Temple,
and at night he went out and abode in the Mount of Olives: And all the people
came early in the morning to him in the Temple to hear him, Luke 21. 37, 38.

To reprove such as stand at a stay, and think they have done enough. Use 1.
It is a certain sign of a man that is but lukewarm in Religion, when he
thinks he has grace enough, when he has no desire, nor uses any endeavor
to get more grace. Thus is the lukewarm Laodicean described, Apoc. 3. 16, 17.
he said he was rich, and increased with goods, and had need of nothing. It is
not possible, but he that has any soundness of grace in him, must needs have
in him a desire to grow. As in the natural body, every member grows till it
come to full stature; so is it in the mystical body of Christ, Col. 2. 19. All
the body furnished and knit together by joints and bands, increases with the
increasing of God, John 15. 2. Every branch that bears fruit, he purges it,
that it may bear more fruit. Therefore though the Thessalonians were grown so
far, that the Apostle praises God for their effectual faith, and diligent
love, and patient hope, 1 Thessalonians. 1. 3. and says of them, that their faith
grew exceedingly, and their love one toward another abounded, 2 Thessalonians. 1. 3.
yet he earnestly exhorts and beseeches them, that they would increase more
and more, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 1. 10.

2. For conuincing of their error, that seek to justify many corruptions,
both in manners and religion, by this Argument; In such and such a man's days,
such things were used, and I hope he was a learned man, and a good man: and why
may they not then be used now? To these men I answer; First, that it has been
an old trick of hypocrites, to pretend great reverence, and respect to the
servants of God that are dead, when their credit might serve to the disgrace of
Gods servants, that do now live and are their teachers. So did the Jews
speak gloriously of Moses and the Prophets, Matthew. 23. 29. They builded tombs
for the Prophets, and garnished the Sepulchers of the righteous. Whereas on the
other side, the faithful are described by this note, that they embrace, and
are established in the present truth, 2. Pet. 1. 12. in that truth that is now
taught them. Secondly, admit that the servants of God, whose judgment and
practice these men do seem to stand so much upon, had been never so learned
and godly men, yet we may not build our conscience upon the credit of any man;
neither of them that have taught us heretofore, nor of them that teach us now,
but only upon the Word of God. We have a notable rule given us, how far
forth we may receive, and rest upon the judgment or example of any of those
worthy men that have been our teachers, Heb. 1^. 7. Remember your guides,
which have declared unto you the Word of God, as if he should say, So far
forth, as they brought you the warrant of Gods Word for that they held and
practiced, have them in reverent remembrance. Whose faith follow. As if he
should have said, Follow them in every thing, but follow their faith, which we
know is only grounded upon Gods Word. If any (though far inferior to them
in piety and learning) shall bring you the manifest Word of God against such
and such an abuse, and you say you will not receive it, because such a learned
and good man was of another mind, you sin in an high degree against God; for
you oppose the credit of man, to the authority of Gods Word. For example; when
we bring plain Scripture, to prove that recreations are not to be used upon
the Sabbath; and you tell us you will not believe us, because such a learned
and godly man allowed bowling on the Sabbath, and shooting on the Sabbath; we
ask you, did the man, whose credit thou stand so upon, bring as plain
Scripture for the justifying of it, as we do for the condemning of it? If no;
take heed how thou set the credit of any man against the authority of Gods
Word. In this case thou must remember what the Apostle says, though we, or an
Angel from heaven, preach any other Gospel unto you, then that which we have
preached unto you (and he taught nothing but what he grounded upon the holy
Scriptures and confirmed by them as is plain by that which himself says,
Acts 26. 22. Romans 1. 12.) let him be accursed, Gal. (...). 8. Thirdly, we are
not bound to rest in the judgment and practice of those good men that have
lived before us, for as it is with the particular members of the Church, so is
it with the whole Church; it must grow and increase in grace. Though Asa was a
good King, and in his first days reformed much, yet Iehos phat reformed more,
2. Chron. 176. And Josiah went further yet, than either Iehosaphat, or any
other that had been before him, 2. King. ^3. 25.

3 To exhort every man, that his chief care be to finish his work well, and
to strive, that his diligence and zeal in doing the Lords work, may be more
toward his end, than at his beginning. An exhortation necessary for us that are
Ministers, and for all Christians: for first, if we should live a thousand
years, we can never finish our work, nor do all the service we owe to God
and his Church. As Christ could not say, It is finished, till he was even ready
to give up the Ghost, John 930. no more can any of us. Secondly, God will judge
and reward us, not according to our first, but our last works, Matthew. 24. 46.
Blessed is that servant, whom his master when he comes shall find so doing,
2. Pet. 3. 14. Be diligent, that ye may be found of him in peace, without
spot, and blameless. Thirdly, it argues a man never did any service to God in
sincerity, if he continue not to the end, Psalm. 92. 13, 14. Such as be planted
in the house of the Lord, shall flourish in the courts of our God: they shall
bring forth fruit in their age: they shall be fat and flourishing. Fourthly the
better a man was in the beginning of his days, the worse shall his case be, if
he hold not out to the end, if he finish not his course well, 2. Pet. 2. 31. It
had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than
after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment given unto them.
Fifthly, it is a great honor to a man, both with God and men, when he is better
in his age, or toward his end, than he was before; when it may be said of him
as of Ruth, Chap. 3. 10. Thou have showed more goodness at thy latter end than
at the beginning, Pro. 16. 31. Age is a Crown of glory, when it is found in
the way of righteousness. And on the other side, there is nothing that makes
a man so base and contemptible to God and men, as to have been religious and
zealous at the beginning, and to become an enemy, or a worldling, or a drone
in the end, Matthew. 5. 13. The salt that has lost his savor, is good for
nothing, but to be cast out, and trodden under foot of men.

Follows the fifth property of true zeal. He that has true zeal, will 5.
prefer Gods honor and service, before any comfort of this life. Our Savior
here prefers the doing of his fathers work, before his meat and drink:
though he were hungry, yet the desire he had to do his fathers work, makes
him forget his hunger. It makes a man willing to neglect his ordinary food,
as our Savior did both here, and Mar. 3. 20. It makes a man willing to
neglect his ordinary rest, our Savior admitted Nicodemus to come to him in the
night, and even then spent much time with him in teaching of him, Ioh. 3. 2.
And Paul spent the whole night in preaching at Troas, A^s. 8 1^. It makes a man
willing to neglect his reputation, as David did in his manner of dancing before
the Arc, 2. Sam. (...). 20, 2^. and our Savior in making a scourge of cords,
and driving out of the Temple with it the oxen and sheep, and men also, and in
pouring out the changers money and overthrowing the table^ Insomuch as his own
Disciples when they saw it, remembered and applied unto him that which was
written, The zeal of thine house has eaten me up. They saw his zeal had even
eaten him up and made him to neglect himself and his reputation, John 2. 15.
17. It makes a man willing to forget, and fall out with his dearest friends in
the Lords quarrel, as Moses says of the Tribe of Leui, Deuteronomy. 33. 9. Who said
to his father and mother, I have not seen him, neither knew he his brethren,
nor knew his own children. It makes a man willing to foregoe the things he
has most delighted in, as these women did that gave their looking glasses made
of fine brass (the instrument that they had use of for the dressing and
adorning of themselnes) toward the building of Gods Tabernacle, Exodus 38. 8.
It makes a man careless of his worldly ease and peace. See what stripes, and
imprisonment, and perils Paul endured, that he might profit the Church, 2. Cor.
11. 23 -- 26. It makes a man willing to neglect the comfort of society. Paul
was content to tarry at Athens alone, and to want the comfort, of Timothies
society, rather than the Church should want his service, 1 Thessalonians. 3. 1.

In a word, though a man may lawfully use and enjoy the comforts of this life,
yet if he cannot sometimes be content to weane himself from them, and to want
them for the Lords sake, and his service; he has no true zeal nor love of God
in him. Nay, a man shall never have any sound comfort in Religion, till he can
say it has cost him somewhat, I will not offer burnt offerings unto the Lord
my God, of that which does cost me nothing says David, 2. Sam. 24 24. No man
can enjoy this pearl with comfort, that prizeth it not above all other things,
and cannot be content to sell all he has for it rather then he will want it,
Matthew. 13 46.

For reproof of such as pretend they love the Lord and his Word, and yet
prefer every trifle that has the least show of profit and comfort before Use.
it; will suffer nothing for it, will foregoe or forbear no comfort, or
contentment of this life for it; these men shamefully deceive themselves,
Matthew. 10. 37. He that loves father or mother more then me, is not worthy of
me.

Specially, this serves to discover the hypocrisy of such, as cannot forbear
their sports on the Lords day: first, they violate the manifest commandment of
God, who forbids us to do that we take pleasure and delight in upon his holy
day, and tells us we do not esteem the Sabbath in our hearts as we do, nor
honor him in it, if we do that wherein we find pleasure, upon that day, Esaias
58. 13. secondly, their sin is much increased and aggrauated, because they do
it openly and publicly, they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not,
Esaias 3. 9. thirdly, they do it in contempt of the Word, by the Ministry whereof
the unlawfulness of this has been discovered unto them, and they have been
admonished and reproved for it. And this as the Apostle says, Romans 7. 13.
makes sin exceeding sinful. This circumstance made even the gathering of a
few sticks upon the Sabbath a capital crime, Number. 15. 35. Let them also look
to this, that suffer their servants so to do, and set them on too.

Follows the sixth and last property of true zeal. He that has true 6.
zeal, makes the revealed will of God the guide and directour of his zeal.
Our Savior here showed his zeal, in doing the will of him that sent him, and
finishing his work, Gal. 4. 18. It is good to love earnestly always in a good
thing, says the Apostle. Pro. 19. 2. Without knowledge the mind is not good,
and he that hastes with his feet, sins: as the faster a man goes, if he be
out of the way, the greater his danger is. If a man be in the right way, he
cannot be too forward, zealous, or precise, Psalm. 119. 32. To run the way of
Gods commandments is a duty, and no fault.

To exhort such as desire to please God, to seek the knowledge of Gods Use 1.
Word. Many good souls have many troubles and discomforts, and make their
lives far more irksome than they need, by making conscience and scruple of
many things they need not, by being righteous overmuch, as Solomon speaks,
Eccles. 7. 18.

To exhort all men to examine their zeal. Zeal if it be not well guided, is
like a sword in a mad man's hand; the most dangerous thing that may 2.
be, and that that will draw us into the most heinous sins, even to be most
bitter enemies and persecutors of Gods truth and servants. Such is their zeal,
that stand for, and urge so eagerly the traditions of men. This zeal was the
chief cause of the greatest malice, that ever was borne to the Doctrine and
Church of God; the devout women in Antioch were the fittest instruments the
Jews could use to persecute the Apostles and expel them out of their coasts,
Acts 13. 50. and it was Paul's zeal toward God, that made him persecute the
way of Christ even unto the death, Acts 22. 3, 4. And that that made the Jews
and other enemies of the Gospel, to excommunicate Gods servants and to kill
them, was this conceit they had (out of a blind zeal) that they did God good
service in it, John 16. 2.

THE SIXTIETH LECTVRE, ON IVLY, XXXI. MDCX.
IOH. IIII. XXXV -- XXXVIII. Say not ye there are yet four months, and then
comes harvest? Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the
fields; for they are white already to harvest.

And he that reapeth receives wages, and gathers fruit unto life eternal:
that both he that sows, and he that reapeth may rejoice together.

And herein is that saying true: One sows, and another reapeth. I sent you to
reap that, whereon ye bestowed no labor; other men labored, and ye are
entered into their labors.


Our Savior, having in the former verses given a most plain demonstration of
that ardent desire that was in him, to win souls unto God, does in these
verses labor to stir up and kindle the like affection in his Disciples. And
this he does by three very effectual arguments: First, from the present
necessity of their care and diligence, because the harvest was now even ripe,
and ready for the sickle, verse 35. Secondly, from the great reward and comfort
they should be sure to receive for doing of this work, verse 36. Thirdly, from
the easiness and facility of the labor God required of them, verse 37, 38.
The first of these three arguments, taken from this present necessity, our
Savior sets down, verse 35. by a comparison taken from the care that men
have of their harvest; they think of it, and talk of it, and provide for it,
even four months before it come. They so cast and dispose of their business,
that they may have nothing to hinder them in harvest; much more will they have
care of it, when their corn grows ripe, and ready for the sickle: then they
will neglect all other business, and break their sweetest sleep, and labor
early and late, and forget their meals, to save and gather their corn. And
the reason of this care and diligence of men in their harvest works, is the
present necessity; when the corn is once ripe, it will bear no delay, because
if it be not reaped and inned, it is in danger to be lost and spoiled.

Now, says our Savior, the Lords corn is already white unto harvest, it is
ripe and ready for the sickle; if it be not now reaped and gathered, it will be
lost and spoiled: and that you may easily perceive, if you will but lift up
your eyes, and look upon the regions. Behold, how God has prepared the hearts
of men to receive the Gospel. See in what multitudes, and with what great
desire they flock unto it, and that not only in Judea, but even here among
the Samaritans.

Now the Doctrine, that our Savior intends to teach us here, is this, That
the Ministry of the Word is a matter of great necessity, for the Doct. (...).
salvation of men. For our Savior here compares the people of God unto corn
that is ripe, and the Apostles (in respect of their Ministry and preaching)
unto reapers; and uses this reason to stir them up to zeal and diligence in
teaching, because as the corn that is ripe, must needs perish, if it have
none to reap and gather it; so must Gods people needs perish, if they have
none to teach and instruct them. It is not only good, and profitable, and fit
that Gods people should have Preachers; but it is a matter of necessity also
Many proofs might be brought for this Doctrine, but I will at this time insist
only in this argument of comparison, which our Savior uses in this place. We
shall find therefore, that there is scarce any one truth in all religion,
which the Holy Ghost has taught us so plainly, by so many familiar
comparisons and similitudes, as he has done this truth of the necessity of the
Ministry of the Word. And the cause why the Holy Ghost teaches us this by
similitudes, is, because we can far more easily understand earthly than
heavenly things. The necessity of having Preachers few can conceive: the Lord
has therefore taught it us by such comparisons, as every man can understand
and judge of. Five of these comparisons I will propound unto you:

1. Sometimes Gods people are called the Lords pleasant Garden, and f^full
Orchard, Cant. 4. 12, 13. and the Preachers are called Planters and Waterers of
it, 1. Cor. 3. 6. And if you have a plot for a Garden or Orchard in the best
soil under heaven, it is not possible it should yield you any pleasant fruit,
if it have had none to plant and water it.

2. Sometimes the people of God are called the Lords building, 1. Cor. 3. 9.
his house and temple, 2. Cor. 6. 16. and the Preachers are called the Lords
Masons and Carpenters, that must both lay the foundation, and set up the whole
building, 1. Cor. 3. 10. I have laid the foundation, and another builds
thereon.

3. Sometimes Gods people are called the sons and daughters of God, 2. Cor.
6. 18. and then Preachers are called both the spiritual fathers, by whom they
are begotten unto God, 1. Cor. 4. 15. and the nurses, by whom they are fed with
milk, while they are babes in Christ, I have fed you with milk, 1. Cor. 3. 2.
and the Lords stewards, that must provide stronger meat for them, when they
are grown to ripe years, and at whose hands they must receive their portion
of meat in due season, Luke 12. 42.

4. Sometimes Gods people are called Pilgrims, that travail in a strange, and
unknown, and dangerous way, 1. Pet. 2. 11. and then Preachers are called their
guides, Heb. 13. 7. and the light of the world, Matthew. 5. 14.

5. Lastly, Gods people are called sometimes the Lords husbandry, and corn
field, 1. Cor. 3. 9. and then Preachers are called both his laborers, that by
stocking, and dunging, and plowing the ground, prepare it, we are laborers
together with God, 1. Cor. 3. 9. and his seeds-men, that sow it, the sower
sows the Word, Mar. 4. 14. and his reapers and haruest-men, that get down
his corn, and bring it into his barn, as you may see, the harvest truly is
great, but the laborers are few, pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest
that he would send forth laborers into his harvest, Luke 10. 2. and in this
Text most plainly.

The Reason why preaching is of such absolute necessity (as we have heard)
Reason.
to the salvation of men, is that which the Apostle gives, 1. Cor. 1. ^1. It
pleased God, by the foolishness of preaching, to save such as believe: not any
excellency that is in us, or in our preaching; for doubtless, the holy
Scriptures, the written Word of God, which you have in your hands, is of far
greater worth and excellency, than any Sermon we can make unto you. Neither is
it any inability in the Lord, to save whom he pleases without preaching; but
the only reason is, that it has pleased God, to ordain and appoint this to be
the mean, whereby he will begin, and perfect the work of grace in his Elect.

The first Use of this Doctrine, is to convince the judgment of men in this
point: For there is scarce any one truth of God, that finds more strong
oppositions Use 1.
and reasonings against it, in the nature of man. Yea, the more excellent parts
of nature men have, the greater enemies they are wont to be unto this truth.
But howsoever he that is a mere natural man, or an Atheist, that believes
not the Scriptures, may still doubt of, or oppose this truth: let no Christian
any longer withstand it, or make any question of it (now he has heard it so
clearly and evidently confirmed to him out of Gods Word) lest he be found even
a fighter against God, as Gamaliel speaks, Act. 5. 39. But let him learn to
captiuate his reason to the obedience of God, 2* Cor. 10. 5. and pray against
his infidelity, as Mark 9. 24. even cry with tears unto God, to help his
unbelief.

The second Use of the Doctrine, is to reprove them that think and say, so
much preaching is needless, we have too much preaching; that 2.
count the calling of the Ministry the most unnecessary calling in the
Commonwealth; that think of all callings and conditions of men, Preachers may
best be spared: and therefore spoil this function, and disgrace it by all
means. Of those men it may be said, as Psalm. 73. 9. they set their mouth
against heaven. For, how can a man more directly contradict the Word and Spirit
of God, than by saying or thinking thus? But know this (beloved) for a
certainty, that as in the Church there is no calling of that necessity as a
good Ministry (the Lords Orchard, the Lords Building, the Lords Family, the
Lords Husbandry cannot possibly be without it) so even in the Commonwealth,
there is no calling but one so necessary, no calling but one (the Magistracy
I mean) whereby the Commonwealth receives so great benefit, as by the
Ministry, Thou leddest thy people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and
Aaron, Psalm. 77. 20. Yea the best policy that any state can use, to cause the
Commonwealth to prosper and flourish, is to plant in every part of it, in
every Congregation, an able and a faithful Ministry. That is the reason, why
the Prophets of God are wont to be called the Chariots and Horsemen of Israel,
2. King. 2. 12. the chief strength and munition that Israel had. So when the
Levites that fled from the ten Tribes received entertainment under the
government of Rhehoboam, and exercised their ministry there, it is said
expressly, 2. Chron. 11. 17. that they strengthened the Kingdom of Judah, and
made Rhehoboam the son of Solomon mighty. And when Iehosaphat had sent
Preachers to all the Cities of Judah, to teach the people, 2. Chron. 17. 9. it
is immediately added, Verse 10. that the fear of the Lord fell upon all the
Kingdoms of the lands, that were round about Judah, and they fought not against
Iehosaphat. And there be two reasons for this, that no wit of man is able to
gainsay: First, the sins of the land are the bane of the Commonwealth, the
only things that bring ruin upon a state, for the transgression of a land
many are the princes thereof, Pro. 28. 2. And there is no such mean to
restrain men from sin, as the Ministry of the Word. No law of man can do
it, because it cannot work upon the conscience; the ministry of the Word will
do it, when it is backed and countenanced by the authority of the Magistrate.
Secondly, the strength and prosperity of a kingdom consists in this, when
superiors rule well, and inferiors obey well, and equals live justly and
lovingly together. Now the Ministry of the Word, where it is backed and
countenanced by the Magistrate, will cause men to do this, and to do it even
out of conscience to God, which is the strongest band of all other, ye shall
fear every man his mother (she is named first because children are most apt to
neglect their duty to her) and his father, and (as a mean thereof) keeping my
Sabbaths, Leuit. 19. 3. And therefore (to conclude) Magistrates and great men
can no way better show themselves to be indeed fathers of their Country, and
good commonwealths-men, than first, by placing able Ministers in all places
where they have to do, as Iehosaphat did: 2. Chron. 17. 9. and secondly, by
countenancing and giving encouragement to good Ministers, by all good means,
as Hezekiah did, 2. Chron. 30. 22.

The third Use of this Doctrine, is for exhortation; that every one of us 3.
would submit our selves in practice to this ordinance of God, and be
persuaded, it is a matter of great necessity, to live under a good ministry,
to hear, and to hear often. Three reasons there be, which if we could weigh
them well, would move us to it. First, that the Holy Ghost makes it a mark
whereby he may be known, whom God has elected unto life, to be willing and
desirous to hear, my sheep hear my voice, John 10. 27. and the contrary, a
mark of a reprobate, ye therefore hear not Gods Word, because ye are not of
God, Ioh. 8. 47. a greater sin than the sin of Sodom, Matthew. 10. 14, 15.
Secondly, because every man has cause to suspect that the good things that
seem to be in him, be but the fruits of the flesh, and not of the spirit, if
he came not by them by this means. For a mere natural man may have many good
things in him, as remnants of Gods Image, and do many good things, the
Gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law,
Romans 2. 14. but the only means of regeneration, is the Word preached, being
borne again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the Word of God,
1. Pet. 1. 23. and this is the word which by the Gospel is preached unto you,
ver. 25. Therefore is it so expressly noted of those Churches and persons, whose
conversion the Holy Ghost gives testimony unto, that they were converted by
preaching. Observe this in all the Churches and persons, that the Apostles
wrote their Epistles unto. The Romans were in the number of those that were
converted by Peter's Ministry, Acts 2. 10. the Corinthians were begotten anew by
Paul's Ministry, 1. Cor. 4. 15. the Galatians received the spirit by the hearing
of faith (the doctrine of faith) preached, Gal. 3. 2. the Ephesians trusted in
Christ after that they had heard the word of truth and not before, Ephesians. 1.
13. the good things that were in the Philippians they had received by hearing
of Paul, Phil. 4. 9. the Colossians brought forth no fruit unto God, till the
Gospel came to them, and they had heard it preached by Epaphras, Col. 1. 6, 7.
the Thessalonians were won to God by Paul's Ministry, 1 Thessalonians. 2. 13. Timothy
was begotten to God by Paul's Ministry, 1. Tim. 1. 2. and so was Titus, Tit. 1.
4. and so was Philemon, Phil. 1. 9. the Christian Hebrews were required to
follow the faith of them that had spoken to them the Word of God, Heb. 13. 7.
and they to whom the Apostle James did write, were begotten by God through the
Word of truth, James 1. 18. and so were they to whom the Apostle Peter wrote,
1. Pet. 1. 23. and those to whom John wrote, had that grace which he desires
should abide in them, by hearing, 1. Ioh. 2. 24. the good things that were in
the Elect Lady and her children were wrought in them by John's Ministry, 2. John
8. and Gaius was one of his children also, 3. Ioh. 4. and the faith full unto
whom Jude writes had been hearers of the Apostles, Jude 17. Thirdly, whatsoever
a man's state and condition be, he has need to hear: First, such as are both
ignorant and void of sense and care of their salvation; for this is the means
to open their eyes, and bring them out of the power of Satan, Act. 26. 18.
Secondly, such as have already good affections and desires; for they are in
danger to perish, not withstanding their good desires, if they be not
instructed; as appears by the comparison our Savior uses here, Ioh. 4. 35.
which I opened unto you even now. Thirdly, such as have attained to a good
measure of knowledge: for knowledge without faith avails not; and this is the
only means to make us believe that we know, Rom 10. 14. Fourthly, such as
have both knowledge, and good affections, and true faith, and sanctification,
because these graces are imperfect in the best, and will dye if they grow not,
and be not nourished; and this is the means of growth and perseverance, it is
ordained for the perfecting of the Saints, and the edifying of the body of
Christ, Ephesians. 4. 12.

The fourth Use, is to stir up the Minister to diligence in his calling, to
which he is tied by a double bond; first, in respect of the commandment 4.
of God, necessity is laid upon me, yea woe is unto me if I preach not the
Gospel, 1. Cor. 9. 16. secondly, in respect of the necessity of the people, he
is set as a watchman over Gods people, etc. Ezekiel. 33. 6. To this end it is
profitable for him to do as Christ here wills his Disciples, viz. lift up
his eyes, and behold the regions, that is, consider the estate and condition of
his people, and seek to take particular knowledge of the estate of every one
of his people (as Paul did who taught them at Ephesus from house to house, Acts
20. 20. and warned every one of them, verse 31.) And this will make him
diligent, and careful to teach them, if he have any bowels in him. This
wrought compassion toward the people in our Savior, Matthew 9. 36. When he saw
the multitudes, that they were as sheep scattered abroad, having no shepherd,
he was moved with compassion toward them.

The sixty one Lecture. August 7. 1610. JOHN IIII. XXXVI.
IT follows, that we proceed now unto the second argument, that our Savior
uses, to move his Disciples to zeal in their ministry, which is set down in
this verse; and that is taken from the reward and comfort they shall be sure to
receive, if they be faithful and painful in their ministry. For our Savior,
continuing the comparison which he had begun in the former verse, gives here
three notable encouragements, from the example of the haruest-man:

1. The harvest man thinks not much of his toil and labor, because he
knows he is sure to receive wages; yea better wages, and better cheer for
haruest-worke, than for any other work in husbandry. All men are wont to be
liberally minded toward their harvest folk: and it is noted for a sign of a
cruel and unmerciful man, at that time, when God bestows his blessings on
him, with a liberal hand, to be hard and miserable toward them, by whose
service and labor he receives them. They that tread their winepresses,
suffer thirst, says Ioh, speaking of the cruel oppressor, Job. 24. 11. And
James 5. 4. Behold, the hire of the laborers which have reaped your fields
(which is of you kept back by fraud) cries, and the cries of them which
reaped, are entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts. And if men be wont to
respect their haruest-folke so much, then surely (says our Savior here) my
Father will not suffer you, that are his haruest-folke, to want. He that
reapeth, receives wages; he that gains a soul to God, shall be sure to be
well rewarded.

2. The haruest-man is encouraged to do his work much more chearefully, when
the corn that he reapeth is good (without weeds, heavy in the sheafe, and
good for the yield) though it be not his own corn, though he receive no more
wages for reaping it, than he should do, if it were bad; yet does he his work
far more chearefully, in a plentiful harvest, when the corn is good, and
will yield good increase and profit unto the owner. Yea, in such a case, when
the corn is such, as the reaper may fill his hand, and the gleaner his lap,
they that pass by will rejoice, and will be ready to encourage the reapers,
and say, The blessing of the Lord be upon you, we bless you in the Name of
the Lord, Psalm. 129. 7, 8. Now (says our Savior) the fruit that you shall
gather, which are the Lords reapers, is another manner of grain and fruit than
they work for; far more excellent in nature, more durable, such as yields
far greater profit and comfort to the owner of it. Whosoever reapeth the
Lords corn, gains souls to God, shall not only be sure to receive good
wages, but gathers fruit unto eternal life. The fruit of his labors, the
grace that by his Ministry is wrought in the hearts of men, shall never perish,
but endure unto everlasting life And therefore (says he) it is a shame for
you, if you take not pains, if you do not your work dililigently and
carefully.

3. The haruest-man is encouraged to do his work, to toil and labor in it
chearefully, because he knows that when harvest is done, they shall have mirth
and joy, he and all his fellow servants shall be merry together; not only
those that have reaped with him, but even those that did sow the corn, which
they have now reaped, shall rejoice as well as they, when by the plentiful
harvest they shall discern, that their pains and labors they took was not
lost, but has prospered so well. And this custom of making merry, and
rejoicing after harvest, we shall find it has been very ancient, Esaias 9. 3.
They have rejoiced before thee, according to the joy in harvest. Yea, the Lord
has commanded and enjoined his people a public and solemn rejoicing, and
ordained, that the feast of Tabernacles should at this time be kept to that
end, Deuteronomy. 16. 1^, 14. Thou shall observe the feast of the Tabernacles seven
days, when thou have gathered in thy corn, and thy wine, and thou shall
rejoice in this feast, thou, thy son, thy daughter, thy servant. And verse
15. Thou shall in any case be glad. Now (says our Savior here to his
Disciples) no haruest-man can have so great encouragement to his labor in this
respect, as you may have; for when your work is done, you shall have great and
vnspeakcable joy: yea, this shall increase your joy; you and the Prophets, that
have labored before you in this work of the Lord, and sowed what you shall
reap, shall meet and make merry together.

And thus have I showed you the meaning and purpose of our Savior in these
words. The principal Doctrine that the Holy Ghost intends to teach us in
them, is this,

That the faithful Minister, that labors to win souls to God, shall be
sure to be well rewarded; how ill soever the unthankful world reward Doct. 2.
him, God will certainly reward him

For the proof of the Doctrine, observe it in these two points: First, that
even in this life, while they are doing their work, the Lord has care to
provide well and liberally for them, that they may want nothing while they are
doing his work, as the husbandman does for his haruest-men. Secondly, that
when they have done their work, the Lord uses to give them better wages, a
greater reward than other of his servants, as the husbandman also does to his
haruest-men. The first of these two points, if we judge of it by sense and
reason, we shall hardly be able to conceive how it can be true; for no kind of
men has ever seemed to be more neglected of God in this life, than the
faithful Minister. For the Prophets, we know what Stephen says, Which of the
Prophets, have not your fathers persecuted? And James 5. 10. Take my brethren
the Prophets, who have spoken in the Name of the Lord, for an example of
suffering affliction, and of patience. And for the Apostles, hearken what Paul
says, 1. Cor. 4. 9. I think (says he) God has set forth us, as men
appointed unto death; we are made a gazing stock to the world, to Angels, and
men, And verse 11. We suffer hunger and thirst, and are buffeted, and have no
certain dwelling place.

But if we will look into it with a spiritual eye, we shall find this to be
true, that even in this life God has special care to provide for faithful
Ministers above all other men. This may evidently appear to us in three points:

1. None of Gods servants have such promises for sufficiency, and a competent
measure of the blessings of this life, as the faithful Minister has. Moses
has a strange speech to this purpose, Deuteronomy. 10. 8, 9. At that time the Lord
separated the tribe of Leui, to bear the Arc of the Covenant of the Lord, to
stand before the Lord, to minister unto him, and to bless in his Name unto
this day. Wherefore Leui has no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the
Lord is his inheritance, according as the Lord thy God promised him. He gives
two reasons why Leui should have no inheritance: first, because God has
separated, and put him apart for his service: and secondly, because the Lord is
his inheritance, as he promised him. As if he should say, Because I have
separated him to my special service, I will take the care of providing for him
specially: and that my care of him may the better appear, he shall have no
other inheritance, but me. And when Christ sent forth his Apostles to preach,
Matthew. 10. 10. he bids them carry no victuals, nor change of apparel, nor
other provision with them; and gives this for the reason, Because the workman
was worthy of his meat. Yea, the Lord has showed the like care even of the
wife and children, that the faithful Minister has left behind him. See an
experiment of this, in 2. King. 4. 1 -- 7. One of the sons of the Prophets dyed
in debt, and left his wife and children in great distress, but God
miraculously provided both for the payment of his debts, and for his wife and
children also to live upon.

2. None have such promises of protection and deliverance from trouble, as the
faithful Minister, Psalm. 122. 16. I will cloth her Priests with salvation.
Ier. 1. 18. Behold, I have made thee a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and
walls of brass against the whole land, verse 19. For they shall fight against
thee, but shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee, to deliver thee,
says the Lord, Revel. 2. 1. Christ holds the stars; yea, all of them, in
his right hand. If any man shall ask, How falls it out then, that in all
ages they have been so much in trouble, and that their enemies have so
prevailed against them, and that oftentimes even unto the death? I answer, the
reason was, not that the Lord became careless of their peace, and liberty, and
safety; but, first, either because their testimony was finished, and that work
which God in his wisdom had determined to work by them: As it is said of
Gods two witnesses, Revel. 11. 7. When they have finished their testimony, the
beast that comes out of the bottomless pit, shall make war against them,
and shall overcome them, and kill them. Or else, secondly, because the Lord
sees he shall receive more honor by their suffering, and constant confession
of his truth, than by their peace, as the Apostle says of his own troubles,
the things which happened unto me, have fallen out rather to the furtherance of
the Gospel, Phil. 1. 12.

3. None of Gods servants have so many, and so clear promises, that God will
take their part against their enemies, and revenge their wrongs, as the
faithful Minister has. When David had said, Psalm. 105. 14. He suffered no man
to do them wrong, but reproved Kings for their sake: he expresses, ver. 15.
who they were, that God had this special care of above the rest. Touch not
mine anointed, and do my Prophets no harm. Hitherto belongs that
benediction and prophetical prayer, that Moses made for Leui, Deuteronomy. 33. 11.
Smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate
him, that they rise not again. Therefore we shall find, that of all the sins,
whereby a people have provoked him, God has been least able to endure this, 2 Chronicles. 36. 16. Judah was guilty of many sins, before their captivity, but
mark which of all their sins did the most provoke God against the land; They
mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and mis-used his
Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord rose against his people, and till there
was no remedy.

And this may suffice, to show what care God has of his reapers, his faithful
Ministers in this life, while they are doing his work. Now for the second
point, that when their work is done, and the day of payment shall come, the
Lord will have greater respect unto them, than to other of his servants, is
also very evident in the holy Scriptures: First, when the day of reckoning and
payment shall come, they shall be the first that shall receive their wages.
Reu. 11. 18. The time of the dead is come, that they should be judged, and that
thou should give reward unto thy servants the Prophets, and to thy Saints,
and to them that fear thy Name. Secondly, as they shall be first in the
reward, so shall they receive the greatest reward. Matthew. 5. 12. Great is your
reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the Prophets. Dan. 12. 3. They that be
wise, shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many
to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever.

The Reason of all this, is, Because God receives more honor by their Reason.
work and service, than by the labors of any other of his servants. Luke 1.
15. He shall be great in the sight of the Lord: the reason is given, verse 16.
Many of the children of Israel shall he turn unto the Lord their God.

The Use of this Doctrine, is, to encourage and comfort the Ministers of
Christ, against all the grieuances and discomforts they receive from the Use.
world: First, the discomforts and indignities that we endure, are nothing to
that which the Prophets and Apostles did endure; and we have many outward
comforts which they wanted. Secondly, if our conscience can witness with us,
that we are faithful in our calling, and careful to employ that talent we
have received to our Masters profit, we may be sure that the Lord esteems
well of us, and we are dear unto him. And what man, that is in high favor
with the Prince, will be disquieted, if a child or a mad man, that he meets
with in the street, refuse to do him reverence, or mock him? If we be
faithful, we shall not need to be covetous, or to disquiet our selves with
care for the things of this life, nor to fear the malice or subtilty of our
enemies. Let us do the Lords work faithfully, and cast our care upon him for
those matters.

2. Remember that the reward thou shall receive, when the day of reckoning
shall come, will abundantly recompense all the toil, and care, and disgraces
thou have endured. This reason the Apostle uses, 1. Pet. (...). 24. when he
had said, Feed the flock, care for it, do it willingly with a ready mind; he
gives this for the reason, verse 4. And when the chief Shepherd shall ap
pear, you shall receive an incorruptible crown of glory. It is very
profitable for every Christian, to meditate often of this day of reckoning, when
every man shall receive his wages, according to his work. And this is one
notable difference, between a godly man and a wicked; that whereas it is a
hell to a wicked man to think of his end, and of the life to come, Amos 6.
(...). They put far from them the evil day; the godly man has no comfort
nor encouragement like unto that. Psalm. 27. 13. I should have fainted, except I
had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.

To exhort all men that they would show themselves the children of their
heavenly Father, in esteeming of good Ministers, as the Lord esteems of 2.
them. We are fallen into an age, wherein the very calling of a Minister, is
grown into a general contempt with most men. If a man have not somewhat else
beside his Ministry to grace him (friends, or wealth, or titles) every one,
even the youngest and basest, will despise him I know well, a great cause of
this is the just judgment of God upon the insufficiency, idleness,
covetousness, and lasciuiouinesse of many Ministers; for so says the Lord,
Mal. 2. 9. I have made you to be despised and vile before all the people,
because ye kept not my ways, but have been partial in the law. But these
are not the Ministers I would have you esteem of: for God esteems not of
such; but such as are able Ministers in any good measure, and faithful; them I
exhort you to love and esteem of Learn not of Papists or Atheists how to
esteem a good Minister, but learn of thy heavenly Father how to esteem of
him. I say, not only take heed thou persecute them not, wrong them not,
disgrace them not, deride them not, grieve and discourage them not, (He that
derideth and disgraceth Ministers, is a persecutor of Ministers; when Ismael
mocked Isaac, the Holy Ghost says, He persecuted him, Gal 4. 29. and he that
grieueth and discourageth a Minister, hinders Gods work in his Ministry,
therefore the Apostle says, it is unprofitable for the people when the
Minister cannot do his work with joy, but with grief, Heb. ^3. 17.) But I
say more, see thou love every good Minister, and esteem of him, encourage him
by all good means, if thou will show thy self the child of thy heavenly
Father: so have good men been wont to do, Hezechia spoke comfortably to all
the Levites, and taught the good knowledge of God. 2. Chron. 30. ^2. yea he
commanded the people to give the portion to the Priests and the Levites, that
they might be encouraged in the Law of the Lord, 2. Chron. 3^. 4. and of
Josiah, it is said, that he encouraged the Priests to the service of the house
of the Lord, 2. Chron. 35. 2. Let no man count himself religious that does not
love and reverence every good Minister, Matthew ^0 11. Enquire who is worthy
(that is, who fears God, loves the Word) and there be bold to tarry and
receive entertai^ement; As if he should say, Every one that is worthy, will be
ready to show kindness unto you. If ye have judged me to be faithful to the
Lord (says Lydia, Acts 16. 15.) come into mine house and abide there, and she
constrained us.

The sixty two Lecture. August 21. 1610. JOHN IIII. XXXVII, XXXVIII.
WE have already heard, that in these verses, and those two that go before,
our Savior has endeavored, to stir up his Disciples to that diligence in
their Ministry, and that zealous desire to win souls to God, as they saw to be
now in him; and that he uses three effectual arguments to persuade them
thereunto, all set down in an allegory and comparison, taken from them that
do haruest-worke: two ofthem we have already handled and finished in the two
former verses; the first taken from the present necessity of Gods people, verse
35. and the second taken from the reward and comfort themselves should be sure
to receive by it. It follows now that we proceed unto the third and last,
which is set down in these two verses that I have now read: and that is taken
from the facility and easiness of that work that they were to do in
comparison of that wherein their fellow servants the Prophets that had been
before them had labored. This argument he amplifieth by a prouerbiall speech
that was common among the Jews: when they saw any enjoy the fruit of another
man's labor, they were wont to say, One sows and another reapeth, As we also
say in the like case, One beats the bush and another goes away with the
bird. This proverb, says our Savior, in some respect, may fitly be applied
to your case, though in another respect it agrees not with it: Herein is the
saying true, As if he should say, Though not in all respects, yet in this it
is; And in the next verse he shows two points, wherein this proverb agrees
to their case.

First, as he that reapeth takes nothing so much toil and pains, as he did
that sowed, and did the first works that belong to husbandry; so is it in your
case, you are to be employed in the best, and easiest, and most comfortable
labor that belongs to my Fathers husbandry, not in manuring, or plowing, or
sowing, or harrowing, or weeding of his ground; that is, in preparing men to
receive grace, and laying the foundation and first principles of religion in
the hearts of men, as the Prophets were (whose pains in that respect were
far greater than yours can be) but in reaping, and converting men effectually
to the faith, and obedience of the truth; you shall presently see the fruit of
your labors: but so did not they. I sent you to reap that, wherein ye
bestowed no labor; Other men labored, etc.

Secondly, as when one receives the benefit of another man's labor, so is it
in your case; the Prophets took pains for you, you shall enjoy the fruit of
their labors: the pains they took shall be a great advantage to you in your
Ministry; ye shall be able to do the more good by your preaching, because of
that, that they have done before you. Other men labored, and yet are entered
into their labors.

The point wherein this proverb could not fitly be applied to their case, was
this, that whereas when one sows, and another reapeth, he that sowed has no
comfort or fruit of his labor, but esteems it as a judgment of God upon
him, and repents himself of the pains he has taken, when he sees another
man has reaped the fruit of it. It is far otherwise in this case: for, as he
had said before, verse 36. he that sows and he that reapeth shall rejoice
together: the Prophets shall not think their labor lost, but though they
converted few or none, in comparison of that that you shall do, yet when they
shall understand what good you have done in your Ministry, and what help you
shall have received by their labors, they shall be so far from envying and
murmuring at it, that they shall rejoice in it exceedingly.

So that we see these words do offer to our consideration, three principal
points, as the fountains from which the Doctrine and Instruction must arise,
which we are to receive from them. First, that the Prophets and Ministers under
the Law were sowers; they prepared and made men fit to receive good by the
ministry of the Apostles; and the Apostles were reapers, they converted and won
more to God than the other did.

Secondly, that the service and labor of the Apostles, was in this respect far
more easy and comfortable, than the labor of the Prophets had been, because
by the Prophets Ministry, the people of God were prepared to their hands, and
made ready to receive and obey the truth.

Thirdly, that the Prophets shall be no whit discontented at this, when they
shall understand, that the Apostles have done much more good than themselves
were able to do, but shall rejoice in it rather.

This then is our first Doctrine, that we are to learn in this place:

That the Ministry that the Church enjoys now under the New Testament, is in
this respect more excellent, than that which the Church had before Doct. 3.
Christ's coming; that this is more profitable, and fruitful, and effectual
to win souls unto God than that was; they were sowers, and we are reapers.

For the proof of this Doctrine which I have delivered, and for the right
understanding of our Saviors meaning in this place; it shall be profitable for
us to consider; first, how the Prophets are here said to have been sowers
only; secondly, how the Apostles are called reapers.

For the first, The Prophets are said to be sowers in three respects: first,
they sowed the seed of the Gospel: and the Apostles did reap nothing, but
that which the Prophets had sown before. They won the people to the profession
of no other faith and religion, but that only which the Prophets had taught; no
more do we at this day. This Paul plainly professes, Acts 26. 22. that he
had taught no other thing, than that which Moses and the Prophets had taught
before.

Secondly, the Prophets by that that they taught, prepared the people, and made
them desirous and fit to receive the Doctrine of the Apostles. How could that
be (may you say) seeing there was none of those to whom the Apostles preached,
that ever heard any of the Prophets? Answ. I answer, that by the writings of
the Prophets they were thus prepared. We read, that at the time when our
Savior came, and when the Gospel was to be preached by him and his Apostles,
the people of God were maruellously prepared to receive it. So it is said of
Simeon, that he waited for the consolation of Israel, Luke 2. 25. and Verse 30.
it is said that Anna spoke of Christ, to all that looked for redemption in
Jerusalem. Yea (as we heard Verse 25. of this Chapter) not only the Jews but
even the Samaritans also, were thus prepared to receive him; they all (both
Jews and Samaritans) expected his coming at this time, and the performance of
those glorious promises that God made to the Church in him; yea they even
waited and longed for it at this time; thus were they prepared to receive the
Gospel, All the regions round about were white even to harvest. And how were
they thus prepared? Surely by the writings of the Prophets. So, after, we read
that the thing that made them so ready to receive and believe the Doctrine of
the Apostles, was this, that they found it so consonant to that which they had
read in the writings of the Prophets, Acts 17. 11. 12. So that the Apostles
could never have done that good they did in their Ministry, had they not been
helped by the labors and writings of the Prophets.

Thirdly, the Prophets did no more, but sow the seed, they reaped not, they
saw not the fruit of their own labors. Ob. How can this be? Did not the
Ministry under the Law convert souls also? did it not reap and gather some
corn into the Lords barn? Answ. Yes surely; for of the Ministry of the
Prophets it is said, Ier. 23. 22. that such of them as stood in Gods counsel,
and declared his words to his people, should turn them from their evil ways,
and from the wickedness of their inventions. And of the Ministry of Leui, it
is said, Mal. 2. 6. that the law of truth was in his mouth, and he did turn
many from iniquity. But if we compare the fruit of that Ministry, with the
Ministry of the Apostles, with the Ministry of the New Testament, it was
nothing. They may be said to have reaped nothing, to have gotten no corn at
all; yea they labored not so much for themselves and the times they lived in,
as for us and our times. This is that our Savior here speaks to his
Apostles, Other men labored, and ye are entered into their labors. And more
plainly the Apostle Peter, 1. Pet. 1. 12. It was revealed to the Prophets,
that not unto themselves, but unto us they should minister. This is plain
also, Romans 16. 25, 26. the mystery which was kept secret since the world began,
is now made manifest, and by the Scriptures of the Prophets according to the
commandment of the everlasting God made known unto all nations. We receive
more good by their labors, than either the Church in their time, or themselves
did. They are better understood now, than they were then. And thus have we
seen how the Prophets are said to have been sowers.

The Ministers of the New Testament, on the other side, the Ministers whom
Christ does send, are called reapers; because they see much more fruit of their
labors, than the Prophets did. This Ministry is much more powerful and
effectual to convert souls, than the Ministry of the Prophets was. This is
that that Christ says here, I sent you to reap: and John 15. 16. I have
chosen and ordained you, that you go, and bring forth fruit. You shall never
read that they preached in any place, but they did good, and won some to God
there. Yea the fruit and efficacy of their Ministry was exceeding great;
insomuch as Peter at one Sermon converted more than either any of the Prophets,
or John Baptist, or Christ himself did in all their time, Acts 2. 41.

Neither was this efficacy and fruitfulness peculiar to the Ministry of the
Apostles (though they had it in greater measure than any other) but this may
also be truly said of all the Ministers of the New Testament, That they are
far more fruitful and profitable in their Ministry, than the Prophets were.
For though Christ speaks here to his Apostles only, yet this comparison
holds between the Prophets and all the Ministers of the Gospel, they were
sowers, and we are reapers. This is plain by another speech of Christ, Matthew.
11. 11. for there, having preferred John Baptist before all the Prophets, and
that in this respect (among others) because he gained more to God by his
Ministry, than any of them had done, as appears, Verse 12. From the time of
John Baptist hitherto, the Kingdom of heaven suffers violence: he adds in
the latter end of that 11. verse, Notwithstanding he that is least in the
Kingdom of heaven, (that is, in the new estate of the Church, is, not in
respect of his person and gifts, but of his Ministry) greater than John Baptist.

Hitherto belong those prophesies, that in the days of the Gospel, the Church
should so increase, Esaias 54. 2, 3. Enlarge thy tents; for thou shall encre ase
on the right hand, and on the left, and that knowledge should then abound, Esaias
11. 9. and sanctification also, after those days (the days of the Gospel he
means) says the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it
in their hearts, Ier. 31. 33. Nay, the Lord never sends any faithful
Minister to a people, but he uses to make his Ministry fruitful unto some,
the sower never goes forth to sow, but he meets with four sorts of ground,
whereof the one is good, as our Savior teaches us in that Parable, Matthew. 13.
3 -- 8. Yea, this is made a note of an able Minister of the New Testament, 2.
Cor. 3. 6. he is a Minister not of the letter only, but of the spirit.

The Reasons of this Doctrine are three:

1. All things that concern our salvation, are more clearly taught and
Reasons.
more fully, in the Ministry of the Gospel, than they were under the Law. This
is plain, Colos. 1. 26. where the Apostle calls the Gospel a mystery, which
had been hidden since the world began, and from all ages, but now is made
manifest to all his Saints.

2. The mercy of God and his free grace, is more fully made known, and offered
unto men in the Ministry of the Gospel, than it was under the Law. This
reason the Apostie gives, the grace of God that brings salvation has
appeared unto all men, Tit. 2. 11.

3. The Spirit of God (which only makes the Word of God effectual in the
heart of man) is much more plentifully bestowed since the time of Christ's
Ascension, than ever it was before. This is plain, John 7. 39. The Holy Ghost
was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.

This Doctrine serves for the Use and profit, both of us that are Gods
Ministers, and for all you that are Gods people. First, we that are Ministers,
Use. 1.
are to be exhorted by this Doctrine, that we labor to be fruitful, and
profitable in our Ministry. Seek not wealth, or ease, or credit, but fruit.
Labor to find that thy Ministry has done good, that it has been effectual
to the conversion of some. This made Paul so earnestly desirous to see the
Romans, that he might have some fruit among them also, as he had among the
other Gentiles, Romans 1. 13.

Four Reasons may be given to move us to this care:

1. God has placed us in this calling, and given us the gifts we have to this
end, even for the perfecting of the Saints, and for the edifying of the body of
Christ, Ephesians. 4. 8. 12. the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man
to profit withal, 1. Cor. 12. 7.

2. Every man should count it his misery to be unprofitable, it is noted for a
great part of the misery of our estate by nature, that we are altogether
unprofitable, Romans 3. 12. how much more a Minister? Matthew 21. 30. cast ye
the unprofitable servant into utter darkness, there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.

3. Nothing will yield us that comfort in life or death, as this; not all the
wealth we have gathered, nor the credit and applause we have had, 1 Thessalonians. 2.
19. they whom he had won to God were his hope, and joy, and crown of rejoicing.

4. This is the chief thing that will assure us, that God has indeed called
us to be Ministers of his Gospel, and approves of our Ministry, when we are
fruitful, when the porter (the Holy Ghost) appears unto us, and gives
entrance to our Ministry into the hearts of the people, John 10. 3. as we know
he did to Paul's Ministry into the heart of Lydia, Act. 16. 14. We have heard
all the Ministers of the New Testament, are reapers. The servants, to whom God
committed his talents, if they were good and faithful servants, gained
somewhat to their Master, Matthew. 25. 23. Thus Paul approoueth himself to be an
able Minister of the Gospel, the Corinthians that were converted by his
Ministry, were his letters of commendation written in his heart (yiedling him
much inward comfort and assurance of his calling) and also known and read of
all men, such an evidence of his calling as was apparent unto all men, 2. Cor.
3. 2. this he calls the very seal of his Apostleship, 1. Cor. 9 2

Now, seeing this is so necessary, I will give some few rules out of Gods Word,
which if we follow, we shall be sure to reap fruit of our labors:

1. We must be diligent and painful, both in study and in preaching, give
attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine, neglect not the gift that
is in thee, but both by diligence in study, and in preaching labor to stir
it up and increase it says the Apostle unto Timothy, 1. Tim. 4. 13, 14.

2. When we teach, we must labor to teach that (not wherein our selves may
show most learning or eloquence, but) which may be most profitable, and of use
to them we teach, speak thou the things which become sound (wholesome)
doctrine, Tit. 2. 1. and the things that he would have Titus to affirm
constantly, and to insist upon in his Ministry, are the things that are good
and profitable unto men, Tit. 3. 8.

3. Strive to teach in that manner, as may most profit thy hearers. Mark 4.
33. Christ preached so, as they were able to hear. This was Paul's mind,
though he excelled all the flaunting preachers at Corinth in the tongues, yet
he professed that in the Church he had rather speak five words to the capacity
and edification of others, then ten thousand words in an unknown tongue, 1.
Cor. 14. 18, 19. Hitherto belongs that exhortation, preach the Word,
reprove, rebuke, exhort, that is, apply thy doctrine always to the present
estate and condition of thy hearers, 2. Tim. 4. 2.

4. Take heed to thy life, that thou do nothing to hinder the fruit of thy
labors, take heed unto thy self, and unto the doctrine, 1. Tim. 4. 16. And 1.
Cor. 9. 15. it were better for me to die, then that any man should make my
glorying void, that is, rather then that any man should be able to object ought
against me, that might disprove my uprightness of heart and faithfulness in
my Ministry which is the maine thing I have to rejoice and glory in.

5. Be earnest with God in prayer, that he would make thy Ministry fruitful,
Paul bowed his knees unto God for the Ephesians, Ephesians. 3. 14. for it is he
only must give us grace to teach profitably, we are not sufficient of our
selves to think any thing as of our selves (to meditate of any good thing) but
our sufficiency is of God, 2. Cor. 3. 5. and our people grace to hear
profitably, he teaches them to profit, Esaias 48. 17. We should importune the
Lord in that manner, as Rachel did Jacob, Genesis 30. 1. give me children or else
I die.

6. Enquire for fruit, and deal with thy people in private, to see how they
profit by thy labors, so did our Savior with his hearers, Matthew. 13. 51. have
ye understood all these things? And the Apostle did not only teach publicly
but from house to house, Act. 20. 20. Heb. 13. 17. Thou must watch over their
souls.

This Doctrine serves also for the Use of all Gods people.

1. It teaches us how great profit we may make of reading the Scriptures. 2.
Though God have not appointed that to be the mean, to work faith and
regeneration; yet does it notably prepare, and make men fit to receive good by
hearing. We have heard, the Apostles could never have done that good by
preaching, if the people had not been prepared by reading of the Prophets, our
Savior therefore commands his hearers to search the Scriptures, and to
acquaint themselves well with them, John 5. 39. One chief cause you profit so
little by your hearing, is, for that you exercise not your selves in the
reading of the Scripture. If parents would train up their children in the
principles of Religion, and in reading of the Word at home, while they be
young, it would be a great advantage to them for their profiting by preaching.

But alas, we might as well allege to any of you, a sentence out of Bernard or
Augustine, as out of the holy Scripture: for you cannot tell whether we allege
it right or no, so unacquainted you are with it, God has written unto you (for
your use) the great things of his law, but they are accounted by you as a
strange thing that belongs not unto you, as the Lord complained of the Jews,
Hos. 8. 12. But if he only be an happy man, that can delight in the law of the
Lord, Psalm. 1. 2. then are you doubtless in a wretched case, that take no
delight in it at all, never read it, no not on the Lords day. You count it a
tedious thing to keep the Sabbath: you know not how to spend it without
gaming, etc. because you take no delight in the reading of the Scripture. The
Lord enjoined the King, to read the Word all the days of his life; and gives
this for the reason, that he may learn to fear the Lord, and that his heart
be not lifted up above his breathren, Deuteronomy. 17. 19, 20. What marvel then, if
great men grow proud and tyrannous oppressors; and if both great men, and
mean be so void of Gods fear, so profane as they are, seeing they read the
Scriptures so seldom and negligently as they do?

2. Learn by this Doctrine to judge of the best kind of preaching. He that
reapeth most fruit unto God, wins most souls, is the most able Minister of
the New Testament. That kind of preaching, whereby the people of God profit
most in knowledge and sanctification, is the best kind of preaching: not that,
whereby carnal men are most delighted, or which feeds the humor of a
natural man, and tickleth the ear, but which best edifieth the conscience.
Let no man say he is unlearned, that teaches profitably, and has won many
unto God, for he that wins souls is wise, Pro. 11. 30. when God has
allowed of a man, and commended him, and set his seal on his ministry (as on
these he has done, 1. Cor. 9. 2.) who art thou that dare dispraise, or
despise, or disgrace him? Gods people should not allow best of him that
praises himself (that is, that by his manner of preaching declares
evidently, he seeks his own praise, more than the profit of the people) but
of him whom the Lord praises, by working with him in blessing his labors, 2.
Cor. 10. 18. As Paul says he would judge of the Ministers in Corinth, so
should all Gods people learn to judge of Ministers, 1. Cor. 4. ^9 ^0. I will
know, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power: for the
Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.

To this case our Proverb may well be applied, Show me not the meat, but show
me the man. Compare the hearers of these learned and eloquent Teachers, whom
thou so much admirest, with these who preach plainly, and whom thou despisest
for that cause, see whether have most knowledge and grace, and so thou shall be
able to judge whether is the best Teacher.

3. To teach us, that the state of wicked and ignorant persons, is far more
dangerous and damnable now, than it was under the Law: first, because this is a
time of far greater light, than that was, this is the condemnation that light
is come into the world, John 3. 19. secondly, greater grace is offered now,
than then (yea, received also by such as live under an ordinary and able
ministry of the Gospel, the Apostle Peter speaks even of some hypocrites,
that they had escaped the pollution of the world through the knowledge of
Christ by the Gospel, they were brought to a great reformation, 2. Pet. 2.
20.) Hitherto belong those fearful sentences, if every transgression and
disobedience to the law, received a just recompense of reward, How shall we
escape if we neglect so great salvation, etc. Heb. 2. 2, 3. And again, it is
impossible for those who were once enlightened, etc. Heb. 6. 4 -- 8. declaring
in many words the fearful state of them that have not only enjoyed great
means of grace, but also received some common beginnings of grace by them, and
yet prove naught afterward. And so does he likewise, Heb. 10. 28 -- 31. show
how it is far more dangerous for them to sin under the Gospel then it was
under the Law. Consider therefore, how God under the Law hated and punished
ignorance, it is a people of no understanding, therefore he that made them,
will not have mercy upon them, Esaias 27. 11. the breach of the Sabbath, if ye
will not hearken unto me to hallow the Sabbath day, I will kindle a fire in
the gates of Jerusalem, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, and it shall
not be quenched, Ier. 17. 27. Adultery, It is a fire that consumes to
destruction, and would root out all mine increase, Job 31. 12. Swearing, the
book of Gods curse shall fly upon every one that swears to cut him off,
Zech. 5. 2, 3. And know assuredly, he hates these and all other sins more now,
and will more severely punish them, than he did then; specially, with
spiritual plagues. A sinner shall be more unable to repent now, than under the
Law: yea, the better, and more profitable, and powerful Ministry any wicked
man lives under, the more dangerous and damnable his state is.

Lecture the sixty third. August 28. 1610. JOHN IIII. XXXVII, XXXVIII.
WE heard the last day, that these two verses do contain the third and last
Argument, whereby our Savior stirs up the Apostles to zeal and diligence
in their Ministry; which is taken from the easiness and facility of that
work, they were to be employed in, in comparison of that, wherein their
fellow-seruants, the Prophets, had labored. And in this argument, three things
we heard are offered to our consideration: First, that the Prophets and
Ministers under the Law were fowers, the Apostles and Ministers of the Gospel
are reapers. Secondly, that the service and labor of the Apostles, was to be
(in this respect) far more easy and comfortable, than the labor of the
Prophets had been; because by the Prophets Ministry, the people of God were
prepared to their hands, and made ready to receive and obey the truth. Thirdly,
that the Prophets shall be no whit discontented at this, when they shall
understand, that the Apostles have done much more good in their Ministry, than
themselves were able to do; but rejoice in it rather.

The first of these three points, we finished the last day. It follows now
that we proceed to the two last.

First then we must enquire how this is to be understood, that our Savior
says here to the Disciples, They should reap that, on which they bestowed no
labor, and that other men, (viz. the Prophets) had labored, and they were
entered into their labors: seeing we know; first, that the Ministry of the
Word now, is an office that requires great labor and pains, as well as it was
under the law. Neither shall a man ever be able to do good in this calling,
unless he be a painful man. The faithful Ministers are called (...), 1.
Tim. 5. 17. To pull men's souls out of the kingdom of Satan, and to bring
them unto God, is an endless piece of work, a labor of all labors. It were
a matter of far greater ease, for a man to take upon him the charge of so
many Bears and Wolves, than the charge of men's souls. Let other men think of
us as they please (that of all men we earne our livings with most ease, that a
very mean recompense will serve for the work that we do) I do assure you,
there is not a Minister, that is conscionable and careful to do good, but he
would often be ready to wish, he might live in any calling, rather than in this,
were it not for three things:

First, the conscience we make of our duty, and the necessity that is laid upon
us, to employ the gifts God has given us, 1. Cor. 9. 16.

Secondly, that the work it self (though painful) is a worthy and excellent
work, 1. Tim. 3. 1.

Thirdly, the respect we have to the recompense of reward, that we shall
receive for this work, in doing this thou shall save both thy self and them
that hear thee, 1. Tim. 4. 16.

2. As for the Apostles, their labors were equal, if not far greater, than
any of the Prophets. This will be plain, if we shall but mark what one of
them reports of his own labors, 2. Cor. 11. 23. unto 28.

How is it then that our Savior makes the labor of the Apostles nothing, in
comparison of the Prophets? The answer is:

First, it was not so great amongst the Jews, as the Prophets had been,
because the Prophets by their ministry had prepared the Jews, and made them
ready and desirous to receive the Gospel in the ministry of the Apostles.

Secondly, though it were amongst the Gentiles, as great as the labor of the
Prophets had been amongst the Jews, yet was it in this respect more easy and
comfortable, because they did see much fruit of their labors, and so did not
the other.

This then is the Doctrine we are to learn from hence:

That the forwardness and readiness of a people, in receiving and obeying
Doct. 4.
of the truth, gives great encouragement to the Minister, and makes his labor
far more easy and comfortable unto them. The Preacher of the Word may
receive either great help or great hinderance in his ministry, even from his
people and auditors. When he is to speak to a people, that he knows come with
a prejudice against his person or gifts, or such as he has no hope to do good
on, he cannot do his work so comfortably and cheerfully as he should. Such
hearers discourage him greatly, and cause him to do the work of the Lord more
heavily, with less life and spirit than he ought. True it is, this may be our
fault: for we should do the Lords work faithfully and chearefully, whatsoever
our hearers be. Indeed, in private, the servant of God may, and ought to
forbear to reprove some, even when they do most grievously dishonor God; and
refuse to speak good things in their hearing (yea, though he be asked) but sit
amongst them, as though he had nothing to say; when they be such, as he has
just cause to think, are despisers of the Word, and will be never the better,
but the worse rather, for that which he shall say. Pro 9. 7. He that reprooueth
a scorner, purchases to himself shame, and he that rebukes the wicked,
gets himself a blot. And verse 8. Rebuke not a scorner. Pro. 23. 9. Speak
not in the ears of a fool: for he^ will despise the wisdom of thy words. We
have two notable and strange examples for this silence. When railing Rabshakeh
had spoken most blasphemously against God, it is said, The people of God held
their peace, and answered him not one word, and that Hezekiah had commanded
them not to answer him, 2. King. 18. 36. Another example we have of our Savior
himself, of whom it is often noted, that (though he were able to speak so
graciously and effectually as he was, yet) in the presence of wicked men, he
kept silence from good words. It is said, that Herod questioned with him in
many words, but he answered him nothing, Luke 23. 9. And when he was accused,
both before the High Priests and Pilate, of many things that did nearely touch
both the credit of his Doctrine, and the glory of God, and they provoked him
earnestly to speak and answer for himself, yet would he say nothing; in so
much that they marvelled greatly at him, that he was so mute, Mark 14 60, 61.
and 15. 4, 5.

Let no wicked man think, that when he swears, or talks profanely and
beastly, in the hearing of such as have a note for profession of Religion, and
they hold their peace, that it is either because they are fools, and can say
nothing, or base minded, and dare say nothing; for God has enjoined them
silence, and forbidden them to meddle with thee: therefore they can say
nothing, therefore they dare say nothing. Thou art a privileged person (I tell
thee) and I dare say, thou gloriest much in it. But thou will find it a woeful
privilege one day. Cain had such a privilege and protection, Genesis 4. 15. God
forbad all men to kill him, or to touch him, because he would have him to be
spectacle of his wrath unto men. And thou have a privilege too, God has
forbidden all men to rebuke thee, to speak of good things in thy presence,
that thou may go on, and fill up the measure of thy sin, to such as thou
art, the Lord himself speaks in this manner, Rejoice O young man in thy
youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth; and walk in
the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes, Eccles. 11. 9. If
thou had so much grace, as to judge rightly of this thy privilege, thou
would take small pride in it: but pray rather, that thou may so live, as no
godly man may be unwilling, or afraid to reprove thee, according as David, a
great King did, Let the righteous smite me (said he) it shall be a kindness,
and let him reprove me, it shall be an excellent oil, Psalm. 141. 5. But you
must observe, that when our Savior Christ was thus silent, he stood as a
private person. In his public ministry he spoke good things, and taught the
will of God nevertheless freely and boldly, though the Pharisees, and other
wicked men were present, when he taught. And by his example we are taught, that
we should not be daunted nor discouraged in our ministry, by the presence of
any wicked man whatsoever he be, but we should do our work faithfully and
chearefully, whatsoever our hearers be. For first, though any come to hear us
with never so bad a mind, God can, and does often catch him, and change his
mind, as he did the officers, whom the Pharisees had sent to apprehend Christ,
John 7. 45, 46. and that unbeliever, 1. Cor. 14. 25. Secondly, and though he
do not so, yet our labor shall not be lost upon them; no, not upon the
carpers, the scorners that hear us: for they shall one day know, there has
been a Prophet amongst them, Ezekiel. 33. 33. yet though this be an infirmity in
a Minister, to do his work heavily, amongst such as he sees no hope to do
good upon, yet it is such an infirmity, as the best of Gods servants have been
subject to; they have been apt to receive great discouragement in their
ministry, by a bad auditory. When God had made known unto Ezekiel, what a bad
auditory he should preach unto, Ezekiel. 2. 3 -- ^5. They are impudent children,
and stiffe-hearted, surely, they will not hear thee, neither will they cease:
for they are a rebellions house: it is said, Chap. 3. 14. He went to preach to
them in much bitterness and grief of spirit: but (says he) the hand of the
Lord was strong upon me: that is to say, Else I had never gone. It may seem by
that speech that John Baptist used, when he saw many of the Pharisees and
Saduces come to hear him, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee
from the wrath to come? Matthew. 3. 7. that he was never a whit proud of such
hearers. No more, surely, are any of us now, to see notorious drunkards, or
whoremongers, or blasphemers, or profane fools, that scorn all goodness,
come to hear^e us. On the contrary side, when we have such a people to hear
us, as show by their constancy and cheerfulness in hearing, and by their
conversation also, that they are such whose hearts God has prepared to receive
and obey his truth; it does us good to preach to such a people, be they never
so learned: this gives heart and cheerfulness to us in our ministry, and even
set; an edge upon our gifts, and makes us do our work with more freedom of
spirit, and with a larger heart than otherwise we should. The zeal and
feruency, which people show in hearing, does even warm their Minister, and
make him more zealous. The Apostles had excellent gifts, you know, and yet the
goodness of their audience did even mend their gifts. Though they had received
commission to preach to all Nations, Matthew. 28. 19. yet they were at first
unwilling to go to the Gentiles. How did God encourage them? Surely, by making
known the forwardness and readiness of the Gentiles, to receive the Gospel.
Before Paul preached to the Gentiles at Antioch, they besought him to do it,
the whole city came together to hear the Word of God; and upon their first
hearing of the Word, they showed much gladness when they heard that God had
allowed his Word to be preached to the Gentiles, and commanded it also; yea
they glorified the Word of the Lord, Acts 13. 42. 44. 48. This made Paul so
zealous and forward to go to Macedonia, he saw in a vision a man of Macedonia
that prayed him saying, come over into Macedonia and help us, Acts 16. 9. That
made him show such a zealous desire to go and preach to the Romans, because
they were so good a people, Romans (...). 8. 10. Yea, our blessed Savior
himself received (as it were) some help, and increase of gifts, by the
forwardness and zeal of his hearers, seeing the multitudes (that flocked so
to hear him) he went up into a mountain (that they might the better hear
him) and be opened his mouth (set and bent himself to speak so as they might
hear and understand him) and taught them, Mat. 5. (...), (...). What made him
deny so much time to himself from preaching, as might serve even for his
necessary repast, both at this time, and also, Mar. 3. (insomuch, as his
kinsfolk even thought him mad for it, Mar. 3. 21.)? Surely, the zeal of the
people, and their great desire to hear, the multitude comes together again,
so as they could not so much as eat bread, Mar. 3. 20. And if the Apostles,
and Christ himself had even need, or at least received good by this help,
how much more may we?

The Reasons of this Doctrine are two:

1. The faithful Minister has no joy comparable to this, when he sees
Reasons.
the forwardness of Gods people, in receiving and obeying the truth. John the
Baptist rejoiced to see his hearers flock after Christ. John 3. 29. The friend
of the Bridegroom rejoices greatly, because of the Bridegroomes voice: that
is, that the Bridegroomes voice is so well accepted, that he finds so good
entertainment with the Bride.

2. The more zealous and prepared the audience is, the better assistance of his
Spirit God is wont to give to his servants. As it is with thy prayer; the
better thy heart is prepared to pray, the more comfortable and fruitful shall
thy prayer be, when he prepares our hearts, then will he cause his ear to
hear, Psalm. 10. 17. So it is with thy hearing, when thou come best prepared
to hear, then shall the Minister preach best, and most to thy comfort. And
that is the cause, why Gods people have ever found his presence most gracious
and comfortable in the most solemn assemblies, as you have heard before. This,
you that can remember our public fasts, can witness from Lect. 28.

1. To persuade all Christians to the love of the most solemn assemblies Use.
of Gods people, where the most and best of Gods people are wont to meet
together.

2. To exhort Gods people to give all good encouragement to their faithful
Minister, Heb. 13. 17. If they do not their work with joy, it will be
unprofitable for you. And that, the hearers may do three ways. First, by
their diligence in coming to the assemblies, and frequenting their ministry,
that (as we have heard) wrought even in Christ himself great alacrity and
readiness to the work of his ministry. Secondly by showing cheerfulness and
diligence in attention when they are present, as our Saviors hearers at
Nazareth did, Luke 4. 20. the eyes of all them that were in the Synagogue were
fastened on him. And as the creeple at Lystra did, he heard Paul with that
attention and cheerfulness, as Paul perceived by his very countenance that he
had faith to be healed, Act. 14. 9. Thirdly, by obeying and practicing their
doctrine, and causing their teachers to see how they profit by their ministry,
and that is the greatest encouragement of all other, obey them and submit your
selves that they may do their work with joy, Heb. 13. 17. And on the other
side nothing humbles and afflicts the faithful Minister more then to see the
unto wardnesse of his people. I fear when I come, my God will humble me among
you, and that I shall be wail many that have sinned and have not repented,
etc. 2. Cor. 12. 21.

Lecture the sixty fourth. September 4. 1610. JOHN IIII. XXXVII, XXXVIII.
WE have already heard, that these verses contain the third and last reason
our Savior uses to encourage and stir up his Disciples to diligence in
their ministry, which is taken from the easiness and facility of that work
wherein they were to be employed, in comparison of that wherein the Prophets,
their predecessors, and fellow servants had labored. And in this argument,
three points have been observed, as you have heard. The two first of these
points, we have already finished: it remains that we proceed to the third and
last of them.

The third point is evidently grounded upon the last words of the 36. verse That
both he that sows, and he that reapeth may reioyee together. The handling of
which words I have referred to this place, because they do more naturally
belong unto this third, than unto the second argument. Now for the meaning of
the words, that we may the better receive instruction from them, we must
understand, first, that by him that sows is meant the Prophet and the
Minister of the Old Testament: by him that reapeth the Apostle and Minister of
the New Testament, as I have already showed.

Secondly, that the Prophets rejoicing, was for the success and fruit, not of
their own labors so much, as for the fruit of the Apostles labors. The
Prophets should rejoice, to see what good the Apostles had done in their
ministry.

Thirdly, that this is not so to be understood, as if the Prophets being then
in heaven, did particularly understand what good the Apostles did upon earth.
For we have just cause to doubt, that the faithful that are departed this
life, do not know in particular, what is done by us upon earth, further than
God is pleased by the ministry of the Angels, or otherwise to make it known
unto them, when he sees it may tend to the increase of their joy, and for the
benefit of his Church upon earth.

How is this then to be understood, that the Prophets should rejoice in the
fruit of the Apostles Ministry? for if they knew it not, they could not rejoice
in it.

I answer: first, they knew it in part while they lived: for God revealed it to
them by his spirit, how knowledge and grace should abound in the Church after
Christ's coming in the flesh, that the earth should be filled with the
knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea, Esaias 11. 9. that God would
(then) put his Law into the inward parts of his people, and write it in their
hearts, ler. 31. 33. To them it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but
unto the faithful, that they should in these last days, minister both by
their preaching and writing the substance of the Gospel which is now preached,
(...). Pet. (...). 12. And therein they rejoiced, even to foresee this, as
Abraham did to foresee Christ's coming in the flesh, John 8. 56.

Secondly, they shall know it perfectly at the day of judgment, at which time
(and not before) it shall be fully known what every man has done, what fruit
every man's labors has yielded, judge nothing before the time, until the Lord
come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will
make manifest the counsels of the heart^: and then shall every man have
praeise of God, 1. Cor. 4. 5. Which is one reason, why (besides the particular
judgment that every soul goes unto, so soon as ever it is departed out of
the body, after death comes the judgment, Heb. 9. 27.) there shall be a
general judgment, wherein also at the last day, the Lord will then judge
every man according to his works; because before that day it cannot be known
to men and Angels (though to the Lord it be) how much good any good man has
done, or how much hurt any wicked man has done. For, as we know the sins of
many wicked men may do much hurt after they are dead and rotten, as it is said,
2. King. 23. 15. of Jeroboam, that it was he that made Israel to sin, even in
Iosia's days, which was about three hundred and sixty years after his death:
so may the good works of the faithful, fructify and do great good long after
they be departed this life. As David's holy example did good on Josiah four
hundred years after David was dead, he walked in the ways of David his
father and followed his good example, 2. King. 22. 2. At the end of the world,
then when it shall be fully known to men and Angels, how much honor or
dishonor every man has done unto God, the Lord will have a general
judgment. And it is evident, that the rejoicing of the Prophets, that our
Savior speaks of in this place, is to be referred unto this time. For, first,
it is then when the reapers shall receive their wages. Secondly, when the
reapers and the sowers shall rejoice together.

Now then from hence, that our Savior says the holy Prophets and Apostles at
the day of judgment shall rejoice together, though it shall then well appear
unto them, first, that there was great inequality of gifts between them (for
the Apostles had far greater gifts than any of the Prophets.) secondly, that
there was great odds in the success of their Ministry (for the Apostles did
much more good than the Prophets) yet they shall not envy nor disdain one
another, but rejoice together, take comfort one in another. The Prophets shall
rejoice, to see what good the Apostles have done, though they could not do so
much themselves; and the Apostles shall rejoice to see what good the Prophets
have done, though it were not so much as themselves have done.

From hence, I say, we may learn this Doctrine: That there ought to be no
emulation amongst the Ministers of Christ, but (how great inequality soever
Doct. 5.
there be in their gifts, or in the fruit of their labors) they ought to love
and esteem one of another, and one to rejoice in the good that is done by
another. For this we shall need no other proof, than the examples of the
Apostles themselves, that were Master Builders, and whose example we are
commanded to imitate and follow, Phil. 3. 17. Brethren, be followers of me.

Three things we will briefly observe in their example, that are very fit to
confirm this Doctrine:

1. That though they did not only far excel all other Ministers in gifts,
and in the fruit of their labors, but also were above them in calling and
function, and had a higher degree of Ministry than they, which no Ministers of
the Gospel now have; yet they were wont to esteem reverently of the meanest
faithful Minister in the Church, and to account of them, as of their fellows
and equals. So Paul esteemed not only of Tim^thy and Silas (which were
Evangelists) joining them with him as his assistants, in the writing of sundry
of his Epistles, 2. Cor. 1. 1. Phil. 1. 1. Col. 1. 1. Philem. 1. 1 Thessalonians. 1.
1. but even them that were but Pastors (a degree lower than the other) He calls
Epaphroditus his compation in labor, and fellow soldier, Phil. 2. 25.
Epaphras, Tychicus, Clement, and others, his fellow-scruants, and his
fellow laborers, whose names are written in the book of life, Col. 1. 7. and
4. 7. Phil. 4. 3.

2. They are not wont to speak of any faithful Minister, without
signification of a special love and brotherly affection, they did bear unto
them. So Peter using the testimony of Paul, for confirmation of a point of
Doctrine, calls him his beloved brother, 2. Pet. 3. 15. So Paul calls Tychicus
his dear brother, Ephesians. 6 21. and Epaphras his dear fellow-seruant, Col. 1.
7. Neither did he use these as words of course only.

3. They are wont to show great care of the credit of other Ministers, which
they spoke and writ of, especially, with their own people. So Peter speaks
reverently of Paul, and maintains the credit of his Doctrine, against some
that cauelled at it, 2. Pet. 3. 15, 16. And Paul, speaking of Tychicus, calls
him a faithful Minister, Col. 4. 7. So speaking of Epaphras to the Colossians
(where it seems, he was a Pastor, or an Evangelist) he says of him, that he
was for them a faithful Minister of Christ: and that they might the better
respect him, he gives this testimony of him further, That he was earnest with
God for them in prayer; yea, I bear him record (says he) that he has a great
zeal for you. So when Timothies ministry was to be employed among the
Philippians, see how he commends him to them, Phil. 2. 20. 22. I have no man
like minded, who will faithfully care for your matters. But ye know the proof
of him, that as a son with the father, he has served with me in the Gospel.
And speaking to them of Epaphroditus (who, it seems was their Pastor) he
commends him for the great care he had of them. Phil. 2. 26. He longed after
you all, and was full of heaviness, because ye had heard that he had been
sick. And when he had said, he would therefore send him to them speedily, he
adds, Verse 29. Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and make
much of such. See how careful he was to maintain and increase the credit of
good Ministers, amongst their own people; and how far he was from engrossing
all credit and esteem with the people into his own hands. And this mind was
in our Savior himself, who speaking to the people that had been John's
hearers (and did admire him too much) he enters into a large commendation of
John, and of his ministry, Matthew. 11. 7. to 15.

The Reasons of this Doctrine are principally two:

1. For the calling and works sake wherein we are all employed, let a man
Reasons.
so account of us, as of the Ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries
of God, 1. Cor. 4. 1. esteem them very highly in love for their works sake,
1. These. 5. 13. If Timothy come, see that he may be with you without fear
(lack to his safety from the practices of any adversary, and provide for his
comfort every way) for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do. Let no
man therefore despise him, though he be a young man, 1. Cor. 16. 10, 11. which
places do not bind the people only, but as also, to love and esteem one of
another.

2. Because this will greatly strengthen the credit of our ministry with the
people, and cause them to regard us and our Doctrine the more, when they shall
see agreement and love in one of us toward another. That it will greatly grace
our ministry, we may see, Ps. 133. 1. Behold how comely a thing it is, for
brethren to dwell together in unity: that is, to hold society and brotherly
fellowship among themselves: And verse 2. It is like the precious ointment upon
the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aarons beard, that ran down to
the skirts of his garment. So Esaias 52. when he said, verse 7. How beautiful
upon the mountains are the feet of him that declares and publishes peace,
and declares good things, and publishes salvation: he adds as a reason, that
made their feet so beautiful in the eyes of Gods people, verse 8. Thy watchmen
shall lift up their voice, and shout together: that is, they shall agree and
consent together, they shall have but one voice. And that it will not only
make our ministry more gracious in the eyes of Gods people, but also more
fruitful and profitable to them, that is as plain in the same place, Psalm.
133. 1. where he does not only say, It is a comely and pleasant, but a good
and profitable thing for brethren, to dwell even together. And verse 3. he
expresses the fruit of it thus, It is as the deaw of Hermon, that falls upon
the mountains of Zion. And when the Apostle describes the profit and power of
prophecy (that is, of the true preaching of the Word) how it will make an
infidel and ignorant man fall down on his face and worship God, and say
plainly, God is in them indeed: He makes the consent and agreement that is
among the Prophets, in their Ministry, to be one chief cause of it, 1. Cor.
14. 25. He is rebuked of all, he is judged of all. And on the contrary side,
the disagreement and dissension that is amongst the Ministers, cannot choose but
be a great stumbling block to the people, and means to hinder their profiting
by the Word. No engine, that Satan or Antichrist have, does endanger the
Church more than this; and therefore nothing, that by their instruments they
labor more in, than to blow the coals amongst us, and increase the heat of
our contentions. Paul alleges this for the reason, why he went up to
Jerusalem, to visit the chief Apostles, to acquaint himself, and to confer
with them, lest by any means (says he) I should run, or had run in vain,
Gal. 2. 2. This is the cause of that strange earnestness and importunity that
Paul uses in this matter, Phil. 2. 1, 2. If there be any consolation in
Christ, if any comfort in love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any
compassion and mercy, fulfill my joy, that ye be like minded, having the same
love, being of one accord. And Phil. 4. 2. he speaks thus to two women (who
though they were no Ministers, yet labored with him in the Gospel, as he
says, verse 3.) I pray Euodias, and beseech Syntiche, that they be of one
accord in the Lord.

This Doctrine is of great Use, both to us that are Ministers of God, and to
Use.
you that are his people; for we are all jointly to be exhorted by this
Doctrine, first, to pray earnestly unto God (who only is the God of peace and
love, 2. Cor. 13. 11.) that he would at length compound the dissentions that
are in his Church, and work a holy concord amongst all his servants. This is
every man's duty, neither may any look to prosper, that cannot do this, pray
for the peace of Jerusalem (which is by this means best procured) they shall
prosper that love thee, Psalm. 122. 6. Secondly, that every one of us would
endeavor in our places, to procure it as much as in vslyeth, Matthew. 5. 9.
Blessed are the peacemakers.

But beside this general, there is a particular use to be made of this
Doctrine, both by us that are Ministers, and by all you that are Gods people:
but in this I desire to be more large, than the time will now permit me to be;
and therefore I will defer it until the next day.

Lecture the sixty fifth, September 11. 1610. JOHN IIII. XXXVI -- XXXVIII.
THere is particular Use to be made of this Doctrine; first, by the Ministers
of the Gospel: and secondly, by all the people of God.

All that are faithful Ministers are to be exhorted by this Doctrine, that Use
for Ministers.
notwithstanding all excellency of gifts, or difference in judgment, or
practice, that may be amongst any of them, yet they would seek to keep the
unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, to love and esteem one of another.
That we may all of us receive the more good by this exhortation, I will speak
of it distinctly, and show you, first, how far forth the Ministers of the
Gospel must agree together: secondly, the reasons that may move us to seek
this agreement: thirdly, the means whereby we may attain unto this agreement.

For the first, we must know, there is nothing spoken (in the handling of this
Doctrine) in favor of such Ministers, as are ignorant and ungodly men. None of
us are bound to love and esteem of all Ministers. But (though in respect of
their coat and function, they be accounted our brethren, yet) if they be
Idols, or wicked and ungodly men, we are not bound to esteem of them. Nay, the
more high and excellent the function and calling is, which they have taken upon
them, the more vilely and contemptibly should all good men esteem of them.
Matthew. 5. 13. If the salt be unsavory, it is fit to be trodden under foot of
all men. If we cannot be familiar with such, if we can show no respect to such,
let no man account us proud or malicious, we do no more than we are bound to
do. The Jove and agreement that should be between Ministers, binds us not to
like of, or wink at the faults that are in Ministers. I know, some men count
it a breach of the Churches peace, and an argument of a contenti^ and unquiet
spirit in a Minister, if he speak against careless non-res^ncy, if he
reprove the idleness, and pride, or covetousness, or (...) life of any
Minister: But these men are much deceived. No m^ns (...) deserve so sharply to
be reproved, as these sins of Ministers; for the^ are indeed the chief causes
of all other sins committed in the land. (...) 2^. 15. From the Prophets of
Jerusalem is wickeanesse gone forth into the (...). And in this respect, when
Gods people in their public fast, made (...) confession of those sins,
whereby God had been most provoked against them; they make confession, chiefly
of the sins of their Magist^s and Ministers, as the principal causes of all
their plagues. Neh. 9. (...). Our Kings and our Princes, our Priests and our
Fathers, have not done thy law, nor regarded thy commandments, nor thy
protestations.

Object. And whereas some are ready to say, this makes the ministry
contemptible among the people.

Answ. I answer: First, the Holy Ghost says the quite contrary. These sins
that some Ministers do commit, and the rest wink at, and will not reprove,
are the true cause of that contempt the ministry is grown unto. Mal. 2. 9. I
have made you to be despised, and vile before all the people, because ye kept
not my ways, and have been partial in the law. Secondly, it is not unlawful
to bring disgrace and contempt upon such Ministers. They were Preachers, whom
both John Baptist, Matthew. 3. 7. and our Savior, Matthew. 12. 24. calls
generations of Vipers, and that in the hearing of them that were their ordinary
hearers. And see what strange terms of disgrace Peter gives unto certain
Preachers in his time, 2. Pet. 2. 12. They are bruit beasts, led with
sensuality. And verse 4. Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease to
sin: they have hearts exercised with covetousness, and are cursed children.

Object. Why but the Pharisees sat in Moses chair, and taught some good
Doctrine, and held many truths, in which respect, Paul, even after his
conversion, calls himself a Pharisee, Acts 23. 6. so that there was great
danger, lest our Savior so disgracing their persons, might work in their
hearers a contempt of their Doctrine.

Answ. I answer: He saw, that (though they taught some truths, yet) by their
life and other Doctrines, they did more hurt than good; and that the more
credit they had with the people, the more hurt they were likely to do: and
therefore he disgraceth them thus. But though we be not bound to esteem well
of all Ministers, yet of all able and faithful Ministers we are. There has
been long (and is at this day) great difference of judgment amongst Gods
servants in our Church; some hold that there is a form of Church government
set down in the Word, which was practiced in the Apostles times, and which all
Churches are bound unto, unto the end of the world: other of Gods servants are
of another mind. Some hold the ceremonies to be unlawful, others hold them to
be lawful and fit. And this difference in judgment, has wrought great
alienation of heart and affection among Gods servants: but this ought not to be
so.

1. We should reverence and esteem one another; so many as we see to be able,
and painful, and godly men, we are to reverence and esteem of,
notwithstanding these differences in judgment, we ought not to despise or
condemn one another for these things. Romans 14. 3. Let not him that eats,
despise him that eats not, and let not him which eats not, condemn him
which eats. The odious terms of Puritans, or Formalists, of Schismatickes,
or Time-seruers, ought not to be heard amongst brethren.

2. We should avoid all bitterness of contention about these things. Though
we differ in judgment in these things, yet should we endeavor, that the
people may discern no difference, nor disagreement in Doctrine amongst us.
True it is, we may and ought to seek resolution for our consciences out of
Gods Word, even in these things, seem they never so small Romans 14. (...). Let
every man be fully persuaded in his mind. And when we have received good
resolution in these things, we ought to hold that fast, so far forth as God
has revealed his will unto us, the Minister especially, it is required that he
hold fast the faithful Word, Tit. 1. 9. But if we dissent one from another in
these things, it must be without bitterness, in a brotherly manner. Ephesians. 4.
^5. Follow the truth in love, says the Apostle. It is not to be held want of
zeal, or alteration in judgment, but true wisdom in a Minister, to shun
in his Ministry and Doctrine (so far as in him lies) these points that
brethren differ in; and to spend his time in such points wherein we all agree,
and which are more profitable for the people to know. Paul kept back nothing
that was profitable, Acts ^0. 20. In the building of Salomons Temple, it is
said, that there was no noise of hammer, or axe or any tool of Iron heard in
the house, while it was building, 1. King. 6. 7. It were to be wished, that in
our Ministry (whereby Gods spiritual Temples are to be built) there might be
no noise heard of any iarres or contentions that are among our selves; but that
we all would do as David did; though his brethren the Jews had provoked him
much, yet could he not be stirred to fight against them, but used all his skill
and force against the Philistines, 1. Sam. 27. 7 -- 12. So should we all join
our forces against the common adversary. It is promised as a blessed fruit of
the Gospel, which every godly man prays for and desires to see, Esaias 11.
13, 14. That Ephraim and Judah may cease to envy and vex one another, but
that they may join together, against the common adversary.

3. Howsoever we cannot agree in judgment, yet should we love one another, and
be glad to embrace one another acquaintance, and to rejoice one in another
gifts, and faithfulness, and success in his labors nevertheless, for the
difference that is in judgment amongst us about these things. We have a
worthy example for these things in the Primitive Church, Acts 4. 32. The
multitude of them that believed were of one heart and one soul: and therefore
it is said of them, Acts 2. 46. that they were not strange one to another, but
maintained a sweet society together, and rejoiced one in another. They did eat
their meat together with gladness and singleness of heart.

The Reasons that may move us to this agreement, are these. Reason,


First, the great advantage, that all sorts of wicked men, Papists, Atheists,
and ignorant persons, take at our contentions and disagreements. When the Holy
Ghost would intimate one cause why Abraham was so loath to fall out with Lot,
so desirous to compound the differences that were between their heard-men, he
says, Genesis 13. 7. And the Canaanites, and the Perizzites dwelt at that time in
the land. Doubtless we have in our land many Canaanites and Perizzites at this
day, that do take great offense at this, and make it their chief occasion to
alienate their hearts from the truth of God, and from the reverence of our
calling, Matthew. 18. 7. Woe be to the world because of of offenses: it must
needs be, that offenses shall come: it is just with God, and necessary, such
wretches should have somewhat laid in their way to stumble at; but Woe be to
that man by whom the offense comes; woe be to us if we become occasions of
such offense unto them.

Secondly, such as we differ from in judgment, may be Gods dear children and
faithful servants, though they err, and cannot see the truth in these
matters, as we think we do. True it is, that God has made this promise to all
the faithful, Ier. 32. 38, 39. They shall be my people, and I will be their
God, and I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for
ever. But this is meant, that in fundamental points they shall all agree. True
it is also, that it is a thing greatly to be wished and sought after, that all
Gods servants might be of one judgment in all points. It is worthy to be
observed, how often the Apostle beats upon this point, 1. Cor. 1. 10. Be ye
knit together in one mind, and in one judgment, and 2. Cor. 13. 11. Finally,
brethren be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and
the God of love and peace shall be with you. Phil. 3. 2. fulfill my joy, that
ye may be like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, and of one
judgment. The Apostle knew well, that the nearer we agree in judgment, the
faster will our affections be knit one unto another. But though this be to be
desired and endeavored after, yet can it never be attained in this life, that
all Gods faithful servants should agree in all points. Perfect unity, is not
to be looked for in the Church of God, till the number of all the elect be
fulfilled, till the Church be come to her perfection. Ephesians. 4. 13. Paul
speaking of the unity of faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, this
unity, the perfect unity; tells us when it is to be looked for, Even when we
shall all meet together, unto a perfect man, and unto the measure of the age
of the fullness of Christ. It is great rashness and ignorance in any, to doubt
of the soundness of every man's heart, that does not receive and embrace every
truth, that himself does see. If one should say thus of any godly man that
does conform, Surely the truth is so clearly revealed in these points of
difference in our Church, that he cannot choose but see it, only the love of
the world, and fear of trouble, keeps him from acknowledging and yielding to
it: or if another should say of any godly man that does not conform, Surely it
is not possible, but he sees well enough, that these are but trifles, and not
to be laid in balance with the liberty of his Ministry, only a carnal
respect to his credit (because he has stood out and spoken against these
things) keeps him from yielding; surely both these should offend much. God
forbid we should judge thus one of another. For my part, I am fully persuaded,
there are godly and conscionable men on both sides, that will not stick to
profess, every truth that God has revealed unto them, how much soever they
might disadvantage themselves thereby, in their credit and estate amongst men.
It is of fundamental points that the Apostle speaks, 2. Cor. 4. 3. 4. If our
Gospel be then hidden, it is hidden to them that are lost, in whom the God of
this world has blinded their mind. For it is certain, that in as great
matters as these are, about which we differ, there have been many of Gods
dearest children and excellent servants, that have not had the truth revealed
unto them, but it was hidden unto them, they could not see it. Barnabas was a
good man, and yet could not see that that Paul saw, how unfit it was to take
John and Mark with them, who had before given great offense by departing from
them at Pamphilia, and refusing to go with them to the work, Act. 15. 38, 39.
And both he and Peter were good men, and yet could not see that that Paul saw,
viz. that it was lawful and fit for them, to converse with the Gentiles, even
in the presence of the Jews, Gal. 2. 11 -- 14. God bestows his gifts on his
servants in different measure and degree. He reueales some parts of his truth
to some, which he conceales from others, even of his faithful servants;
neither is there any, that clearly sees the truth in all things, but in some
points he is ignorant and does err, 1. Cor. 13. 9. We know it in part, and
prophecy in part. Yea say it were passion or prejudice, that blinded the
judgment of him that differs from thee, (though that be a greater infirmity
than simple ignorance) yet may he be a godly and good man for all that. You
know who it was that said of himself and Barnabas, Act. 14. 15. We are even
men subject to the like passions that ye be.

Thirdly, if any be a godly man, and has an upright heart, thou art bound to
love and reverence him, how much soever his gifts are inferior to thine, or
how much soever he differs from thee in judgment. It is certain, we are to
acknowledge and reverence Gods gifts, wheresoever we see them, though they be
but such as may be in a wicked man. Though Ioab were but a natural man, an
hypocrite, yet the Holy Ghost does often speak of and commend sundry good
things in him: but if we see a man to be a godly man, to have an honest and
upright heart, then are we much more bound to love and reverence him; yea we
should be unwilling and afraid, to note or eye any of his infirmities so, as
our hearts should be alienated or estranged from him. In this we should show
our selves the children of our heavenly Father, He has not beheld iniquity in
Jacob, neither has he seen perverseness in Israel, Number. 23. 21. Is he that
differs from thee a brother, a child of God? take heed how thou despise him,
take heed that thou love him. This was Abraham's reason to Lot, Genesis 13. 8. and
Paul's, we should endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
peace, because there is but one body and one spirit, and we are called in one
hope of our calling, Ephesians. 4. 34. By this we know we are translated from death
to life, because we love the brethren, 1. John 3. 14. And David makes this a
note of one that shall go to heaven, Ps. 15. 4. that he honors them that
fear the Lord. Yea, though he be far thy inferior, though he be full of
infirmities, the Apostle charge Christian husbands to give honor to their
wives as unto the weaker vessels, because they are heirs together of the grace
of life, 1. Pet. 3. 7. We have heard what agreement ought to be among Gods
faithful servants; we have heard the reasons whereby they are to be moved to
it: I will now proceed to the third and last point, which I told you I would
handle in this exhortation: viz, the means whereby we may attain to this
unity and concord; and they are principally three:

1. If we would all of us seek after holiness; till then there can never be
true peace amongst us, follow peace with all men, and holiness without which
no man shall see the Lord, Heb. 12. 14. By this we know that we love the
children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments, till then, we
can never bear a true and holy love unto any man, 1. John 5. 2. Every man that
truly fears God, is of a peaceable disposition, they are the quiet in the
land, Psalm. 35. 20. And the chief raisers and pursuers of contention in the
Church, have been ungodly and graceless men such as serve not the Lord Jesus
Christ but their own belly, Romans 16. 17, 18. And so does the Apostle Jude
describe the seducers of his time to have been, Jude 8. 11, 12. Ungodly men
cannot love nor endure such, as unfeignedly fear God; no, though they be such
as agree with them in judgment in all points, that are in controversy in our
Church, yet will they esteem them as Puritans, and hate them nevertheless,
and experience shows the truth of that which the Lord has taught us, he that
is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked, Pro. 29. 27. These men,
howsoever they talk much, and pretend great care of the Churches peace, yet
are indeed the the chief causes of all our contentions. They are like those
mentioned, the words of their mouth are smoother then butter, but war is in
their heart, Psalm. 55. 21. they hate peace, and the more we seek it, the more
they are bent to war, Psalm. 120. 6, 7. there is no hope at all of peace and
agreement with such men.

2. If we would all of us labor to be humble minded; for pride is the chief
cause of contention, only by pride comes contention, Pro. 13 10. He that is
of a proud heart, stirs up strife, Pro. 28. 25. and humility is the chief
breeder and preserver of unity. If we desire to be kindly affectioned one to
another in brotherly love, we must in honor prefer one another, Romans 12. 10.
And when he exhorts them to unity and love, he tells them first they must with
all holiness and meekness and long suffering forbear one another, or else
they can never keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, Ephesians. 4. 2,
3. And when he had exhorted them, Phil. 2. 2. to be of one accord and of one
mind, he tells them, verse 3. that if they would do so, they must in lowlines
of mind each esteem other better then himself.

3. If we would all of us strive to be zealous of Gods glory, and careful to
set forward his work. The true way to have peace on earth, is to give glory to
God on high, Luke (...). 14.

Lecture the sixty sixth. September 18. 1610. JOHN IIII. XXXVI -- XXXVIII.
THe Use that the people of God, that are hearers of the Word, are to make of
the former Doctrine, is this, That seeing there ought to be no emulation among
the faithful Ministers of Christ, but (how great inequality soever there be in
their gifts, or in the fruit of their labors, or how great difference soever
there be among them in judgment, yet) they ought all to love and esteem one
of another. That therefore the people of God ought to esteem and reverence all
Gods faithful Ministers, hear all, rejoice in all, praise God for all,
notwithstanding any diversity of gifts, or difference in judgment, that they
may discern among them. That as it is made a note of a man's sincerity, in the
love of the Saints, when he loves all the Saints, Ephesians. 1. 15. Colos. 1. 4.
Philem 5. because it is evident, such a one loves a righteous man, in the name
of a righteous man, not in any carnal respect, Matthew. 10. 41. so this is a
note of a man's sincerity, in his love to Gods Ministers, when he loves all
Gods Ministers; because this shows he loves a Prophet in the name of a
Prophet, and not in any carnal respect, Matthew. 10 41. True it is, that
Christians may acknowledge a difference in the gifts of Teachers, and prefer
one before another; yea, they should seek to have judgment, that they may be
able to do it. It is Paul's prayer for the Philippians, Philip. 1. 9, 10. This
I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge, and in all
judgment, that ye may discern the things that excel. Yea, they may desire
to enjoy the benefit of the best gifts, to hear him that has the best gifts.
The speech of the Apostle is general, not to the Ministers only, but to the
people in the Church of Corinth, 1. Corinthians 12. 31. Desire, even with zeal
and holy emulation, the best gifts. And the rule which you should follow, in
discerning who has the best and excellentest gifts, is this: As in general,
all men ought to esteem that the best gift, whereby the Church is most
edified; it is the Apostles reason, 1. Cor. 14. 4. He that prophesies, is
greater than he that speaks with strange tongues, because he edifieth the
Church more: So in particular, every man is bound to be most thankful to God
for, and esteem best of that Ministry, whereby himself has received most
good. By this reason, Paul challenges respect and reverence among the
Corinthians, above other Teachers, 1 Cor. 4. 15. Though ye have ten thousand
instructers in Christ, ye have not many fathers. Thou have cause to say, He is
a good Preacher, by whom thou find thou have profited in knowledge and
grace, whatsoever other men think of him. Thou may say, as 1. Cor. 9. 2. If
he be not a good Preacher unto others, yet doubtless, he is unto me. And
indeed, he only is able truly to commend a Preacher, that can show ^e has
profited and received good by his Ministry; when not his tongue only, but his
life commends his Teacher: when the knowledge, faith, and sanctification thou
have received by his Ministry commends him, then thou commendest him well. 2.
Cor. 3. 2. Ye are our Epistle of recommendation written in our hearts, (that
is, wherein we do inwardly and heartily rejoice) which is understood and read
of all men. 2. Yea, more than that, every Christian should desire to hear
such, to live under such a Ministry, as he may profit by. It should not content
a man, that the Ministry he lives under, is a preaching Ministry, unless it
be such a one, as he may profit by; such a one, as if he be but a babe in
Christ, can give him milk, speak to his capacity, teach him plainly and
familiarly; and such a one, as if he be past a child, grown to further
ripeness, is able to give him stronger meat. It is noted for a property of
the ordinance of God, that it is able to build further, to go forward with
Gods building, Acts 20. 32. And Gods people should desire the sincere milk of
the Word, that they might grow thereby, 1. Pet. 2. 2. Many Christians
(doubtless) are too indifferent in this point; they respect not this in the
Ministry they live under; though it be such as they cannot profit by, they care
not, they grieve not, they seek not further, they make Gods service nothing
but a matter of formality and indifferency. And this indifference in the
people, makes many Ministers more idle and careless, in stirring up Gods
gifts in themselves, than otherwise they would be.

But though the people may acknowledge a difference in the gifts of Teachers,
and ought not to rest in any Ministry they cannot profit by, yet are they not
to despise any. Many hearers offend much, in a partial and factious estimation
they have the Ministers of the Gospel in. And this partiality I find arises
from two grounds:

1. The respect they have to difference of judgment, that is among us in
smaller matters (such as I spoke of the last day) for in this respect, there be
many that affect such only as are of their own minds, with the dislike of
all others, that are of another judgment. One sort have this prejudice against
them that dislike the ceremonies, that for that very cause they despise them,
refuse to hear them, speak all evil of them, whatsoever their gifts, or
doctrine, or life be. Another sort conceive such a dislike against them that
are conformable, as they will not acknowledge, nor make use of the excellent
gifts God has bestowed upon such, only for this cause.

2. The second ground of this partiality, is the respect they have to the great
difference of gifts that is among Preachers; and in respect of this, there be
many that will hear, and follow, and admire some teachers, whom they judge to
be of excellent gifts, but despise and contemn all others.

This factious disposition in the hearers of Gods Word, has in all ages been
the cause of much confusion in the Church of God, and greatly hindered the fruit
of the Gospel of Christ. So when Paul complains, 1. Cor. 1. 11. that he
heard, there were contentions among them; he gives this for the cause, Verse
12. Every one of you says, I am Paul's, and I am Apollos, and I am Cephas. q.
d. Every one makes choice to himself of some one Preacher, whom he does
admire and follow, with contempt of all other; and how can it choose then but
there must needs be contentions among you? and 1. Cor. 4. 6. he forbids them
to swell one against another, for any man's cause. Christians grew very bitter,
and swelled one against another in the quarrel of their teachers, because one
would esteem and admire the teacher he affected, another his, with the
disparagement and disgrace of all others. And whereas they in whom this humor
reigns, are wont to glory, as if they had more judgment, and could discern
better of gifts than others (Alas poor people, that esteem so highly of such
a man's gifts (say they) if they had any judgment and understanding, they would
count him no body) the Apostle tells us, it is quite contrary, and that this
argues rather, that they had very little judgment or grace in them; yea this
made them incapable of profit by the word; while they were of this mind, they
could not profit by it, 1. Cor. 3. 1. I could not speak unto you as unto
spiritual, but as unto carnal men, even as unto babes in Christ: and verse. 4.
for when one says I am Paul's, and another, I am Apollos, are ye not carnal?

I will therefore give you some remedies out of Gods Word, against this humor,
some reasons to dissuade Christians from this partiality in judging and
affecting of their teachers. Of that former, which rises from the respect they
have to our difference in judgment about discipline and ceremonies, I will say
nothing now, but refer you to that I spoke of this matter the last day. For
if these differences should cause no breach of love, or alienation of
affections between us that are Ministers, (as I showed you then at large) then
much less may they give just occasion to Gods people, to dislike or despise
any able and faithful Minister.

I will therefore come to the second, and give you some Reasons, why the
difference and inequality of our gifts, should not cause you to dislike any, in
whom you discern any measure of gifts and faithfulness; but you ought to
esteem and reverence all, be willing to hear all, rejoice in all, praise God
for all.

First, there may be great difference of gifts in Ministers, without any
inequality at all, for which the one should be preferred before the other. You
may hear many teachers, and observe a difference in all their gifts, and yet
not be able justly to say which of them all has the best gift, because every
one of them excels in his kind. God gives his gifts to his Church in a
marvelous great variety, insomuch as you shall scarsly hear any two
Preachers, but you may observe some difference in their gifts. 1. Cor. 12. 4.
There are diversities of gifts (says the Apostle) but the same spirit. If any
man have received a gift (says Peter) let him minister the same one to
another; that is, employ it, put it forth, as good disposers of the manifold
grace of God. The grace of God this way, is very manifold and diverse. John
Baptist had a very powerful gift to terrify secure and obstinate sinners.
Luke 1. 17. He came in the spirit and power of Elias. Our Savior on the other
side had a very mild gift, Matthew. 12. 20. He would not have broken the
bruisedreede, nor quenched the smoking flax. The tendrest and weakest
conscience might have heard him without fear. No one man has all gifts that
belong to the Ministry; but he that excels other men most in some gifts,
has other of his fellow-seruants, that match and excel him in other gifts.
Among the twelve Apostles, it is very likely that Peter in some gifts did
excel the rest, and that was one cause, among others, why Christ did in
special give to him the charge of feeding his lambs, John 21. 15. And yet for
a powerful gift in reproouing sin and denouncing Gods judgments, James and
John excelled him, and were therefore surnamed by Christ, Bonarges, sons of
thunder, Mar. 3. 17. Which also may seem to be the cause why Herod and the
Jews raged most against James, Acts 12. 2. Paul had many excellent gifts, both
for knowledge, 1. Cor. 11. 6. and for utterance too (though he spoke so of
himself in the former place, according to that conceit the Corinthians had of
him) Acts 14. 11. The people at Lystra called him Mercury, because he was the
chief speaker; he had a better utterance than Barnabas: and yet in a gift to
comfort those that were afflicted in mind, it may seem Barnabas excelled him,
who had therefore that name given him by the Apostles. He was called of the
Apostles Barnabas, which is by interpretation, the son of consolation, Acts
4. 36. And in respect of this gift we read of him, Acts 11. 24. he was a good
man, and full of the Holy Ghost, and of faith.

So to one God has given an excellent gift for interpretation of the
Scripture, and to breed and increase knowledge in men; to another an excellent
gift for application, and to breed conscience and good affections in men. This
is the Apostles meaning, when he says, 1. Cor. 12. 8. To one is given by the
spirit the Word of wisdom (this is the Pastors gift) and to another the word
or utterance of knowledge by the same spirit, that is, the Teachers Spirit.

And if you observe this, you shall find, that though some one may have some
more of these gifts than another (as some are very good both at teaching and
exhortation) yet no one man has all gifts, nay none has many in the like
measure and degree. Many ascribe this diversity of men's gifts to the difference
of their education, or industry, and think if such and such were as good
scholars, or would study and take pains as much as others, they might teach
as well as such a one does, and exhort as well as such a one. And indeed much
is to be ascribed to study and diligence in this case; for God uses now to
give his gifts by such means, give attendance to reading says the Apostle, 1.
Tim. 4. 13. But this is not all; but this diversity of gifts comes of Gods
free disposition, so as though we were all equal in learning, and equal in
diligence, yet would there be diversity in our gifts. This is that which the
Apostle says, 1. Cor. 12. 11. All these things works the self same spirit,
distributing to every man severally as he will. Yea this makes greatly for
the glory of God and the benefit of his Church, that the Lord has thus
dispensed his gifts, that he has given so great variety of gifts to his
servants, and not given all to any one man. For first, this does much magnify
the largess and bounty of God, and the riches of his mercy toward his Church,
Christ in his great triumph over Satan and all the enemies of our salvation,
when he ascended up on high, and led captivity captive, gave gifts unto men in
this great variety. To some he gave the gifts fit for Apostles, to some for
Prophets, to some for Evangelists, to some for Pastors, to some for Teachers,
Ephesians. 48 11. Secondly, this was necessary in respect of the several
dispositions of Gods people: for as it is with the bodies of men, all like not
the same meat, and therefore God in his goodness has provided such variety
of his creatures to serve every appetite. So for some this man's gift is
fittest, others will profit more by another gift; yea the same man may for
knowledge profit best by one man's gift, for memory by ano there is, for conscience
and affections by a third man, John had one gift meet for the disposition of
some kind of men, and our Savior a very diverse gift from his, yet more meet
for the disposition of some kind of men, Matthew. 11. 17 -- 19. Thirdly, the
Lord has done this for the increase of love and unity among his servants, that
we might see the need we have one of another, even of every one of Gods
servants, and so might love and esteem of all accordingly, 1. Cor. 12. 21. The
eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee, nor the head again to the
feet, I have no neeede of you.

So that to conclude this first reason, If Christians were as they should be,
it would be a great benefit to them to hear (if it were possible) all Gods
servants. It was so to the first and Primitive Church of Jerusalem, when all
the Apostles and sundry other worthy men did exercise their Ministry at
Jerusalem, the faithful did greatly profit in knowledge and grace by the great
variety of Gods gifts in his servants, as it appears by many testimonies the
Holy Ghost gives of them, Acts 2. 42 -- 46. and 4. 32 -- 37. We might see just
cause (if the fault were not in our selves) to praise God for his great bounty,
in bestowing such plenty and variety of his gifts, and we might also receive
good by every one, whether Paul or Apollo or Cephas all are yours, 1. Cor. 3.
22.

But this that God has given for so great a benefit, most men (through their
corruption) have turned to a great mischief. It were a great benefit to some,
if they never had heard any but their own Pastors; for by hearing men of other
gifts which they better affect, they grow to a loathing of the gifts of their
own Pastor and of all other men; but this shall doubtless tend to their
further condemnation, if they profit not but receive hurt by this great variety
of gifts God has bestowed upon his servants, as is plain by that exprobration
our Savior uses against the Jews that profited neither by John's ministry nor
by his, Luke 7. 31 -- 35.

Secondly, even where there is apparent inequality of gifts to be discerned,
yet no one should be so admired, as that others should be despised. For first,
a man may be a faithful Minister, sent, and approved of God, and yet his gift
far inferior to other of his fellow-seruants: even he that received but two
talents, and gained but other two with them, had the commendation of a
faithful servant, as well as he that received five and gained five, Matthew. 25.
22, 23. Secondly, the Word of God should be esteemed, and received not for his
sake that brings it, but for his sake that sends it, even the Scribes and
Pharisees so long as they sat in Moses chair, and taught nothing but the
Doctrine of Moses, were to be respected in that which they taught though they
were most wicked men, Matthew. 23 2, 3. And the contempt that is done to the
Ministry of the meanest whom Christ sends, is done to him, He that receives
whomsoever I send receives me, Ioh. 13. 20. and he that despises him
despises Christ, Luke 10. 16. Thirdly, thou may profit by him that has the
least gift, if the fault be not in thy self, Every gift that the meanest of
Gods servants has, is given him for the profit of the Church, 1. Cor. 12. 7.
Ye may all prophecy one by one, that all may learn and all may be comforted,
1. Cor. 14. 31. for thy profit depends not so much on the gifts of the
teacher, as on Gods blessing, it is God that gives the increase, 1. Cor. 3. 7.
and who can tell whose Ministry he will bless most? the wind blows where it
lists, John 3. 8. And he often works most mightily by the weakest means, my
strength is made perfect in weakness, says he, 2. Cor. 12. 9. And that which
is said of the works of mercy, Eccl. 11. 6. In the morning sow thy seed, and
in the evening withhold not thine hand, for thou know not whether shall
prosper either this or that; may fitly be alluded to in this case, hear one of
Gods servants as well as another, at one time as well as at another, for thou
know not whose Ministry it is, what Sermon it is that God will please to
work most within thy heart, and make most effectual to do thee good.

THE SIXTY SEVENTH LECTVRE, ON SEPTEMBER, XXV. MDCX.
IOH. IIII. XXXIX, XL. And many of the Samaritans of that City believed on him,
for the saying of the Woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.

So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would
tarry with them; and he abode there two days.


WE have already heard in the eight former verses, what speech passed between
Christ and his Apostles, after the woman of Samaria was gone from him to call
her neighbors. And therein we have heard, that our Savior, so soon as she
was gone from him, did foresee what success she would have, and what a number
of her neighbors she would draw unto him. The expectation of their coming,
filled his heart with such joy, and desire of their salvation, that he forgot
his hunger, and the faintness of his body; yea, he uses it as a reason to
stir up his Disciples to zeal and diligence, because they should by and by
see, by the great number of the Samaritans that would flock unto him, that
Gods people were now prepared to receive the Gospel. In these words, and the
two verses following, the Evangelist declares how that was indeed fulfilled,
that our Savior did foresee and speak of; for many of the Samaritans come to
him, and bring with them hearts well prepared to receive good by him. They
believed in him, before they came to him, upon that which the woman had spoken
of him: they came to him, with a desire to be instructed by him; and therefore
they entreat him to make some abode with them, and when they had prevailed
with him so far, as that he was content to lodge with them two days, they made
good use of him, while they had him among them: for they received such
confirmation in their Faith, by that which they heard from him, as they
profess to the woman, that the light they received from her, was nothing to
that they had gotten by hearing of him. By her speech they were brought to
believe, that he was a Prophet; but by hearing of him, they were well assured,
that he was more than a Prophet, even the Savior of the world.

The four verses divide themselves into two parts: For the Evangelist sets
down, First, the beginnings of the faith and conversion of the Samaritans,
verse 39, 40. Secondly, their increase and proceedings therein, verse 41, 42.
In the beginning of their faith he observes three things: First, the cause and
means whereby it was wrought: Secondly, the effect and fruit whereby it showed
and manifested it self, verse 40. Thirdly, the respect Christ had unto them,
when he saw it in them. The means whereby these beginnings of faith were
wrought in them, was that which they had heard the woman say of him. And what
was that? they heard the woman testify (that is, protest and affirm with
great earnestness and affection, as Jesus being troubled in spirit testified
and said, (that is, spoke it with great earnestness and vehemence of
affection) verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me,
Ioh. 13. 21.) that he had told her all things that ever she did. How this is to
be understood, we heard, when I spoke of verse 29. He had told her sundry
things that were so secret (viz. that she had had five husbands, and that now
she lived in whoredom) that by that she knew well, he was able to tell her all
that ever she did; and therefore out of the abundance of her affection (in an
Hyperbole and excessive kind of speech) she said, and testified, that he had
told her all that ever she did: which they had reason to give credit to,
because out of her zeal and desire to do them good, she was so willing to
publish her own disgrace. And this speech of the woman (whereas one would have
thought, it might have made them afraid to come unto Christ, lest he should
have told them also all their secret sins, yet God so prepared their hearts,
and wrought so with them, that this) was that that brought them to believe and
to come unto him. For by this they understood he must needs be a Prophet at the
least; and because the Church had now bin long without any Prophet, and they
knew (by the Scriptures) that about this time the Messiah was to come, they
were induced to believe that this was indeed the Messiah.

The effect and fruit, whereby these beginnings of their faith did show and
declare themselves, are set down, verse. 40. When they were come to him, they
besought him, that he would tarry with them. So soon as they were come to him,
even before they had heard him themselves (that it may appear to be a fruit of
that faith, which the woman's speech had wrought in them) they earnestly inuit
him to come to their City, and to tarry with them. And this they did, partly to
show their love and respect unto him, in giving him entertainment, and chiefly
out of that desire they had to be instructed by him, and to be further
confirmed in that faith, which was already begun in them. The respect Christ
had unto them, when he discerned these beginnings of faith in them, is set
down in the last words of verse 40. for he yielded to their request and abode
with them two days. And this shall suffice to be spoken for the interpretation
of this Text: Now let us come to those Doctrines, that the Holy Ghost intends
to teach us from this example: First then, we must observe here how easy of
belief these Samaritans were; first, upon the speech of one poor woman, many
of them believed in Christ. She told them, he had made known to her all that
ever she had done; she told them this in a very earnest manner; she appealeth
to their conscience, whether this could be any other than Christ; she desired
them to go with her unto him; and hereupon many of them believed, and went out
unto him, to inuit him unto their City. Secondly, the Holy Ghost commends
them for this, and our Savior gives that approbation unto them in this, and
shows that respect unto them for it, as we shall scarce read he did the like
unto any other.

And from thence we have this Doctrine to learn:

That it is a great grace of God, and sign of election in any, to be
tractable, and teachable, easily drawn to receive and believe the truth of
God, Doct. 1.
ready to yield unto it, when it is once revealed unto him. True it is, that
men may be too credulous and light of belief, it is noted for the property of
a silly man, to believe every thing he hears, the simple believes every
word, Pro. 14. 15. They should not be so simple, as (in the matters that
concern their souls) to receive ought upon the credit of any man, how good
soever he be; no, nor upon the credit of a whole Church: but they ought in this
case to try before they trust, to examine that that is taught them, by the holy
Scriptures, whosoever has bin their Teacher: So it is said of those worthy
Christians at Beraea, that they examined diligently the Doctrine, even of Paul
and Barnabas, they examined their Doctrine by the Scriptures, and are commended
for it, Acts 17. 11. Yea, we have a straight commandment for this, take heed
what ye hear, Mar. 4. 24. prove all things, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 21.

But yet when once the truth is revealed to them, they ought to yield presently
unto it, to receive it with all readiness. So it is said of those worthy
hearers, Acts 17. 11. that they received the word with all readiness of mind.
This readiness consists in four points:

1. When we go to hear or read Gods Word, we should go with an open heart,
willing to learn whatsoever God shall be pleased to teach us. This mind was
in Cornelius, Act. 10. 33. we are all here present before God, to hear all
things that are commanded thee of God. This is made a note of the true subjects
of Christ, Esaias 32, 3. The eyes of the seeing, shall not be shut, and the
ears of them that hear, shall hearken: As if he should say, Whatsoever they
see, they shall willingly see, and whatsoever they hear, they shall willingly
hear. We should even be glad to understand and learn, whatsoever God shall be
pleased to teach, Acts 2. 41. The faithful are called such, as gladly received
the Word.

2. When we go to hear or read Gods Word, we should go with a full
resolution, that when he shall reveal his will unto us, we will obey it. This
resolution was in the Church, he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk
in his paths, Esaias 2. 3. This mind was in David, Psalm. 119. 33. Teach me, O
Lord, the way of thy statutes, and I will keep it unto the end. And Uerse 34.
Give me understanding, and I will keep thy law; yea, I will keep it with my
whole heart. Yea, even when he had fallen grievously, yet so soon as God sent
his servant to him, to show him his sin, he yielded presently, (...) Sam. 12,
13.

3. When once God has revealed his will by his Word unto us in any thing, we
must not dare to dispute, or cauil against it, be it never so contrary to our
reason, be it never so much against our own humor. Romans 9. 20. O man, who art
thou, that wilt reason the case with God? Every thought within us must be
brought into that captivity, into that obedience of Christ (2. Cor. 10. 5.) as
that they may not dare once to rise up within us against any truth of God: For
this we have a notable example, Job 6. 24. Teach me, and I will hold my
tongue, and cause me to know wherein I have erred: As if he should say,
Reveal to me by thy Word, wherein I have offended, and I will lay my hand upon
my mouth, I will not dare to reason in the defense of it.

4. We should be ready to receive Gods Word, and be informed in his will by
any, how much soever he be our inferior. This is that that the Prophet
speaks of the powerful work of Gods Word and Spirit, Esaias 11. 6. where it
prevails, it makes them that were before as Wolves, and Leopards, and Lions,
so tame that a little child may lead them. This Job professes of himself, Job
31. 34. Though I could have made afraid a great multitude, my wealth and
authority was such, that I could have crushed them by my power; yet the most
contemptible of the family did fear me: so I kept silence, and went not out
of the door. If the meanest of my family had come to me, and said, Sir, you
have broken Gods law, you have sinned against God, I durst not have fretted
against him, or rejected his counsel, but I would have yielded to him, and
humbled my self, and shut my self within my closet, till I had made peace
with God. The like example we have in David, 1. Sam. 25. 32, 33. Abigal a weak
woman, and the wife of his enemy, that had contemned and reviled him, comes
to him, even when he was in a great heat against Nabal, and puts him in
mind, that if he should follow his passion, and revenge himself, he should sin
against God; he scorned not her counsel, nor said, Shall I that am a Prophet
and a King, be taught and directed by a foolish woman? But he yielded
presently, though he were in so great a passion; he durst not but receive Gods
Word at the hands of any person how mean soever: yea, he praises God for her,
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which has sent thee this day to meet me,
and blessed be thy counsel, and blessed be thou, which have kept me this day
from coming to shed blood.

The Reasons of this Doctrine, why we must receive Gods truth, when it is once
revealed unto us, with such readiness, why we must be so apt to Reasons.
believe it, to yield unto it, are these: 1. Because the Lord has promised,
that such as shall offer themselves to be taught by him, with such yielding
hearts, them he will teach and guide, he will preserve them from error, he
will resolve them in the truth, and give them a comfortable assurance in the
matters of their salvation, the law of the Lord will give wisdom to the
simple, Psalm. 19. 7. The meek he will guide in judgment, and the meek he
will teach his way, Psalm. 25. 9. If any man will do his will, he shall know of
the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of my self, John 7.
17. so this here in this place. And on the other side, such as are unwilling to
see the truth, will not with love receive it, the Lord is wont to leave them in
uncertainty, and to send them strong delusions, that they may believe lies; to
show himself as unwilling to teach them, as they are unwilling to learn of
him. When our Savior had spoken of that fearful judgment upon the Jews,
hearing they should hear but should not understand, and seeing they should see
but should not perceive, he gives this for the reason, that they had closed
their own eyes, and had not been willing to see and receive the truth that
God revealed unto them, Matthew. 13. 14, 15. And the Apostle prophesying of them
that should fall away unto Popery, tells us that therefore God would send them
strong delusions that they should believe any lie, because they would not
receive the truth with love when it was taught unto them, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 10, 11.
An example hereof we have in Ahab, he was not willing to be taught by Gods
faithful Prophet, but hated him, and therefore God sent a lying spirit into
his false prophets that might deceive him, 1. King. 22. 8. 12. 2. The Lords
sovereignty over us is such, as it becomes us to yield absolute obedience to
him, without all reasoning or gaine-saying, O man, who art thou that replyest
against God? Romans 9. 20. This reason the Lord gives, ye shall keep my
Sabbaths, and reverence my Sanctuary, and why? I am the Lord, Leuit. 26. 2.
This made Eli so to yield, that he durst not once winch against a message God
had sent him by young Samuel, It is the Lord, (says he) let him do what
seems him good, 1. Samuel 3. 18. 3. It is not possible Gods Word should
deceive us, Thy testimonies are very sure, Psalm 93. 5. All the words of my
mouth are in righteousness, there is nothing froward or perverse in them,
Proverbs 8. 8. and therefore there is just cause we should receive it with all
readiness.

The Use of this Doctrine is for Reproof. For if this be a sign of Use.
grace to be so apt to receive Gods truth, when once it is revealed unto us,
then surely, many of us will be found to be void of grace, that yet think very
well of our selves.

1. There be many have heard sundry truths often taught, and plainly confirmed
by the Word of God, that cannot discern them, nor be persuaded of them; as
touching the observation of the Sabbath, the frequenting of the exercises of
Religion, etc. And why can thou not yet see, nor be persuaded in these
things? Surely, if thou had a good heart, half the teaching thou have, would
persuade thee, the very entrance into Gods Word (the first hearing of it) would
have given thee light, Psalm 119. 130. Thou have an ungracious heart, and that
is the cause thou can not see these truths, nor be persuaded. If our Gospel
be hidden, it is hidden to them that are lost. These women that were ever
learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth, were such as
were laden with sins, and led away with diverse lusts, 2. Tim. 3. 6, 7. To
these I may say, Thou can not now see, nor be persuaded of these truths, but
thou shall one day, there shall be only fear to make you to understand the
hearing, when Gods terrors shall come upon you, which none of you can tell how
soon they may come, they will make you to understand well and believe those
things which you have heard, and will not now believe, Esaias 28. 19.

2. There be many that dare reason and dispute against manifest truths, that
use to exercise their ripe heads and fresh wits, in wrestling with the truth of
God, and take it for a glory, to give it a foil; that toss Gods Word up and
down like a tennis-ball, and show no more reverence to it in their talking of
it, nor give more authority to it, than to a piece of Tully. So far as they
see reason for it, they will receive it, and no further. To these men I may
say, as Job 9. 4. Who has hardened himself against him, and prospered? It is
made a note of Gods child, to tremble at his Word, Esaias 66. 2.

3. There be many, that are so far from practicing what they hear, and
obeying the truth, that they glory in this, that they can give us the hearing;
but are not so foolish to believe, and be ruled by us, or to alter their course
for any thing we can say. These men glory in their shame: for there is no worse
sign of Reprobation than this. Elyes sons hearkened not to the voice of
their father, because the Lord would slay them, 1. Samuel 2. 25. I know that
God has determined to destroy thee, because thou have not hearkened unto my
counsel, 2. Chron. 25. 16.

Lecture the sixty eighth. October 2. 1610. JOHN IIII. XL.
WE have already heard, that in this verse, and that before, the Evangelist
sets down the beginnings of the faith and conversion of the Samaritans, and
that therein he observes, 1. The cause and means whereby they were wrought,
verse 40. 2. The effect and fruit whereby they showed themselves. 3. The
respect Christ had unto them, when he saw in them these beginnings of grace.
The first of these is set down, verse 39. which we finished the last day; it
remains, that we proceed to the two last, set down in this verse. The effect
and fruit, whereby these beginnings of grace did show themselves, was this,
When they were come to him, they besought him, that he would tarry with them.
And this they did, 1. Out of their love and reverent respect unto him, that
they might give him entertainment: 2. Out of their desire to make use of him,
and to be further instructed by him.

Now for the first of these two respects, it is to be observed, 1. That they
who before would have been unwilling to give him entertainment, though he had
desired it, the Samaritans refused to receive him, or give him lodging, Luke 9.
53. yea, to have performed a far less kindness to him, as we may see, verse
9. this woman ye know refused to give him a little water to quench his thirst,
now they begin to believe, beseech him earnestly to abide with them. 2. They
show this kindness and respect unto him, though they knew they should hereby
expose themselves to the hatred of their neighbors. 3. They do this, because
they believed him to be a Prophet; for as yet they were not persuaded fully (as
it seems, verse 42.) that he was the Messiah. 4. They are commended by the
Holy Ghost, and approved by Christ for it; which teaches us:

That it is the property of all that have received any true beginnings of
grace, to love, and be glad to show kindness unto the Prophets and Ministers
Doct. 2.
of God.

This the true servants of God in all ages, have declared in four points: 1.
Such as before their conversion were the proudest contemners of them and their
Ministry, have after their conversion ever bin wont to show great reverence and
respect unto them. See this in Naaman the Syrian. He that a little before was
in a rage against the Prophet, 2. King. 5. 11. so soon as ever he was by his
miraculous cure brought to the true God; he with all his train came and stood
reverently before him, and would feign have showed real kindness and bounty
unto him, ver. 15, 16. see it also in those that Peter converted; they that a
little before mocked the Apostles, and counted them no better then men that
were drunk, Acts 2. 15. presently upon their conversion come and speak
reverently unto them, and seek to them for comfort, ver. 37. yea they have bin
apt to exceed that way, as we know Cornelius was, when he fell down at Peter's
feet and worshipped him, Act. 10. 25. 2. They have ever borne a most loving
and kind affection unto them, when he took his leave of the Disciples at
Ephesus, they all wept sore and fell on his neck and kissed him, Acts 20. 37.
when he was to go from Tire, all the Disciples with their wives and children
brought him on his way, Acts 21. 5. The Philippians loved their Pastor
Epaphroditus so dearly, that he (being dangerously sick at Rome) took great
care to keep it from their knowledge, because he knew it would grieve them so
much to hear it, Phil. 2. 26. 3. They have showed great care of their peace
and preservation from trouble and danger, when Paul would have adventured (for
the appeasing of the tumult at Ephesus) to have gone out to the multitude, and
to have spoken to them, the Disciples besought him not to do it, nor they
would not suffer him, Acts 19. 30, 31. when the Disciples at Ptolemais had
heard by Agabus what troubles Paul should endure at Jerusalem, they besought
him with many tears so earnestly not to go thither, that they even broke his
heart with their kindness, Act. 21. 12, 13. Priscilla and Aquila to save his
life, had laid down their own necks, adventured their own lives, Rom 16. 4.
4. They have ever been ready to show their reverence and love unto them, by
entertaining them gladly, maintaining them and ministering unto their
necessities. The Shunamite and her husband you know what kindness they showed
to Elisha, and what entertainment they gave him, 2. King. 4. 8. 10. The good
women that followed Christ, and found comfort in his doctrine, ministered unto
him of their substance, Luke 8. 3. Lydia after she was converted, constrained
Paul and his fellows to come to her house and to abide there, and professes
she should have taken it for a sign that they had doubted of the truth of her
conversion, if they had refused to accept of that kindness, Acts 16. 15. and
the Iaylor washed the wounds of Paul and Silas, and gave them kind
entertainment in his house, Acts 16. 33, 34. The Galatians thought nothing too
dear to bestow upon Paul, though it had been to the plucking out of their own
eyes, Gal. 4. 15. The Philippians sent relief often to Paul when he was in
prison, Phil. 4. 10. 14. 16.

The Reasons of this have bin two:

1. The comfort they have received by them. For if men esteem of the Reasons.
message that is brought unto them, they cannot but esteem of the messenger
that brings it. If they have once found comfort in their doctrine, they must
needs esteem of their persons, esteem them very highly in love for their
works sake, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 13. The Elders (specially) that labor in word and
doctrine are worthy of double honor, 1. Tim. 5. 17. How beautiful are the
feet of them (how welcome are they) that bring good tidings of peace, yea, he
speaks of this as of an inseperable consequence of the Gospel in some of
those to whom God gives preachers of his own sending, Romans 10. 15.

2. That they may thereby help the truth it self, and further the Lords work
in their ministry, we ought to receive such that we might be fellohelpers to
the truth, 3. John 8. so Paul says of the house of Stephanas, that by the
kindness they showed him, they helped him in his Ministry, 1. Cor. 16. 15, 16.
And Hezekiah by the kindness he showed to the Levites, and by the provision he
made for them encouraged them in their ministry, 2. Chron. 30. 22. and 31. 4.
Gods faithful servants have many discouragements in their ministry from the
wicked; and they had therefore need of this help from the kindness of the
godly toward them.

The Use of this Doctrine is,

First, for the Ministers, then for all Gods people. For we that are Ministers
Use. 1.
are to be admonished, that we so carry our selves in our ministry, as we may
deserve this love and respect from the people of God. Every ignorant, careless
and unconscionable Minister is apt to urge this doctrine of the duty and
respect the people owe to Gods Ministers, but they never consider what manner
of Ministers they have bin, to whom Gods people have given this respect, and
for what reasons it is due unto them. If thou be faithful and profitable in
thy ministry, they that unfeignedly fear God, cannot choose, but unfeignedly
reverence and love thee. 2. 1. Exhortation.


The Use that Gods people are to make of this Doctrine is,

First, for Exhortation, that they would be content to receive this truth as
well as others, and not to reject it, because we seem herein to plead for our
selves. Be not un willing to learn from us, even those duties you owe to us as
well as others; nor count it folly, or pride, or covetousness in us, when we
teach you such things; for 1. We are bound to teach you the whole counsel of
God, Acts 20. 27. 2. Remember, whatsoever corruption may be in our hearts in
delivering of it, yet no part of Gods truth has any corruption in it, all the
words of my mouth are righteousness, there is nothing froward or perverse in
them, Pro. 8. 8. 3. A Minister may teach the people what respect they owe to
him, and yet be neither proud nor covetous. Paul himself taught this doctrine,
and pleaded for special reverence and respects at the Corinthians hands, 1.
Cor. 4. 15. and for love, Gal. 4. 17. and that they would pray for him, Ephesians.
6. 19. and even pleads for maintenance also, 1. Cor. 9. 1. 4. We respect not
our selves so much as the peoples profit in teaching this.

Secondly, for Reproof: for if every one that has received any true
beginnings 2. Reproof.
of grace, does bear this reverence and love to Gods Ministers; then surely
many that take themselves to be right good Christians, have no grace in them.
For 1. Many esteem not at all, nor show any reverence to any Minister, because
he is a Minister; but though he be such a man as for birth, education,
learning, wisdom, speech and conversation, they could reverence; for this
very cause only they despise him, because he is a Minister. To these I will say
no more, but wish them well to consider what Christ says, Luke 10. 16. He that
despises you, despises me, and he that despises me, despises him that sent
me. 2. Some will seem to love preachers, but will part with nothing to
maintain them. Like to that hypocrite, that says unto his poor brother that
is naked and destitute of daily food, depart in peace, be thou warmed and
filled (God help thee, get thee to a good fire, get thee some meat) but gives
him nothing, I am. 2. 16. This is the cause of that general complaint that is
made in all places, where the Ministers maintenance rises from the benevolence
of the people, that even where the people are most forward, it uses to decay
much in a very short time. I would wish these to consider the charge God gave
his people, take heed to thy self, that thou forsake not the Leuite as long
as thou live upon the earth, if thou do, thou shall have the worst of it
thy self, Deuteronomy. 12. 19. and the practice of Gods servants, who have ever bin
wont to keep a proportion, between the blessing God has given them in
outward things, and their liberality in contributing to the maintenance of Gods
service, since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the
Lord, we have had enough to eat and have left plenty, for the Lord has
blessed his people, and that which is left, is this great store. The peoples
readiness to pay their tithes and offerings, brought Gods blessing upon them;
and the more God blessed them, the more liberally and cheerfully they brought
in their tithes and offering to the Priests and Levites, 2. Chron. 31. 10. 3.
Some (and that a great some too) are wont to withhold that, which by Gods law
and man's is due unto the Minister; they think ever the Minister has too much;
they envy and cannot endure he should live so plentifully; they count him
covetous if he seek his own, though in the most peaceable manner that he can;
yea where is a man to be found, almost, that pays his tithes willingly? which
yet the Minister has as much right unto by law, as they themselves have to any
thing they possess. These I would have to remember, that all men of worth were
wont to count it their honor to give somewhat to the maintenance of Gods
service, David the King, and the chief fathers, and the captains over
thousands and hundreds and the Captains of the host; and Samuel the Seer, and
Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Ioab the son of
Zeruiah; were wont to dededicate of their substance and of the spoils that
they won in battle, to maintain the house of the Lord and his service there,
1. Chron. 26. 26, 27, ^8. 2. That God promises this as a blessing to his
Church, that in the plenty and abundance he would give to his people, his
Ministers should also be plentifully provided for, when he had spoken of the
plenty of wheat, and wine and oil, and cattle (abundance of all earthly
blessings) that he would give unto his people. he adds, And I will satiate
the souls of the Priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with
goodness says the Lord, Ier. 31. 12. 14. 3. That of all thefts and
oppressions, this is the most dangerous and damnable, when men by fraud or
violence withhold that which is due to the Ministers of God: will a man rob
God? yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, wherein have we robbed thee? In
tithes and offerings, Ye are cursed with a curse, for ye have robbed me, even
this whole nation, Mal. 3. 8, 9.

3. For comfort to such as are Patrons to good Ministers, as relieve and
countenance them; no good work you can do, will give that assurance of Gods
blessing in outward things, as this. I have heard it often said of some, that
their bounty unto Ministers did undo them; but I could never hear it proved. I
doubt not, but such might fall into decay (for Gods promises for earthly
blessings are all with this condition, so far as shall be good for them) but
this, doubtless, was not the cause of it. Mark the promise of God, Honor the
Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits of all thine increase; so
shall thy barnes be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with
new wine, Pro. 3. 9. 10. Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that
there may be meat in mine house; and prove me now herewith, says the Lord
of hosts, if I will not open to you the windows of heaven, and power you out a
blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I will rebuke
the deuourer for your sake, etc. And all nations shall call you blessed, for
ye shall be a delightsome land says the Lord of hosts, Mal. 3. 10, 11, 12.
Observe also the experimennt of this in sundry examples, who were greatly
blessed of God for this, the widow of Sarepta for providing for Elia, 1. Kings
17. 15. the Shunamite for providing for Elisha, 2. King. 17. 30. Ebedmelech for
the kindness he showed to Jeremy, Ier. 39. 17. Yea, in temporal things, even
wicked men have bin blessed of God for this, Rehoboam and his Kingdom were so
for harboring and entertaining the faithful Levites, 2. Chron. 11. 17.
Secondly, if you do this with a good heart, and show this love and respect
unto them, even for their works sake, it will yield you great assurance of a
better reward also, even of spiritual and eternal blessings, He that
receives a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall receive a Prophets reward,
Matthew. 10. 41. That Nehemiah knew this well appears by his prayer, when he had
taken order that the Priests and Levites might be plentifully provided for,
Remember me O my God (says he) concerning this, and wipe not out the good
deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof,
Neh. 13. 14. And Paul assures the Philippians, that the kindness they showed
to him in ministering unto his necessities, was a fruit that would abound unto
their account when the day of their account should come, it would be abundantly
rewarded, Phil. 4. 17.

Lecture the sixty ninth. October 16. 1610. JOHN IIII. XL.
IT remains now, that we proceed to the second end and respect they had in
beseeching him to tarry with them, and that was (as appears plainly by the
two verses following) that they might be instructed by him: they invited him to
tarry, not only that they might show kindness to him, but that they might
receive good from him. Yea, this was the chief respect they had in beseeching
him so earnestly, that he would tarry with them: 1. They unfeignedly desired to
be instructed by him: 2. They fully purposed to believe and obey his Doctrine.
From thence we have this Doctrine to learn:

That this is the chief way whereby men are to show their love and respect to
the Prophets of God, when they make use of their gifts, and seek to Doct. 3.
be directed by them, when they receive and obey their Doctrine. This shall be
proved in the example of such, as the Holy Ghost has commended for their love
and respect they have borne to Gods Prophets and Ministers. We read of great
reverence that Cornelius showed to Peter, Act. 10. 25. He went out to meet him,
and fell down at his feet: and doubtless, the rest of his entertainment was
answerable. But the best entertainment he gave him, and that wherein he showed
most reverent respect unto him, is mentioned verse. 33. We are all here present
before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God. We read of
certain women, that showed exceeding love to Christ: 1. They ministered to him
of their substance, Luke 8. 8. 2. They forsook him not in his troubles, but
followed him to the very Cross, and as they went, showed their affection in
weeping and lamenting for him, Luke 23. 27. 3. They continued all the time of
his Passion beholding him and being eye and eare-witnesses of all that he
endured and spoke, Mat. 27. 55. 4. When he was dead, their affection toward him
dyed not, but they observed the place where he was buried, and went and
prepared ointments to embalme his body, Luke 23. 56. But were these the only
ways whereby they showed their love and respect unto him? No, they made use of
his Ministry. Mat. 27. 55. They had followed him from Galile to Jerusalem in
his last journey, when he took more pains in preaching (as I showed you not
long since) than he had done before in so much time all his life long: yea, as
it will appear to them that well weigh the speech of the Evangelist, Luke 8.
1. they made use of his gifts, not only publicly, but privately also. Before
the multitude assembled, and Christ began his Sermon to them, these women and
the Twelve were with him. Yea, only they (indeed) may be said to receive Gods
Prophets, and to give them that entertainment that is due unto them, who make
use of their Ministry, and will be directed by them, and obey their Doctrine.
Paul is earnest with the Corinthians, that they would receive him 2. Cor. 7. 2.
Receive us, we have done wrong to no man, we have consumed no man, we have
defrauded no man. His meaning was, not to crave of them kindness in any outward
entertainment; for he was not among them, nor purposed to go shortly to them,
but only he desires them to obey his Doctrine. Matthew. 10. 14. Whosoever shall
not receive you, nor hear your words, when you depart out of that house or
city, shake off the dust of your feet. It may be, the Apostles might come into
many a town, that would give them good entertainment for their miracles which
they wrought, and into many a house that would receive and welcome them for
kindred sake; but such receive you not, says our Savior, unless they hear
and obey your Doctrine. And therefore what outward kindness soever they may
offer to do unto you, they shall receive the reward of such, as have contemned
and rejected Gods Prophets. I will give you a plain example for this. It is
said of our Savior, Ioh. 1. 11. He came unto his own, and his own received him
not. How is this meant? Did not the Jews receive him? they flocked after him
by great multitudes to hear him, Luke 12 1. 2. They often praised him highly,
and accounted him to be an excellent Prophet, Luke 7. 16. 3. They invited him
to their houses, and made great feasts for him, Luke 14. 1. 4. They would have
bestowed great preferment on him, they would have taken him by force to make
him a King, Ioh. 6 15. how is it then said, that they received him not? Surely,
because they obeyed not his word; they would not be taught and directed by him,
as John the Baptist interprets it, John 3. 32. What he has seen and heard,
that he testifies, but no man receives his testimony.

The Reasons of this Doctrine are three:

1. In respect of God. It is the commandment and will of God, that all Reas. 1.
men should make their use and profit of such gifts, as he has bestowed on any
of his servants, above themselves; else they sin against God, and do contempt
to his good gifts. The Queen of Sheba is commended by our Savior, for coming
from the utmost parts of the earth, to make use of the excellent knowledge God
had bestowed on Solomon, Mat. 12. 42. And how did sue it? she asked him
questions, and propounded all her doubts unto him, 2. Chron. 9 1. And the like
is spoken to the praise of all the Kings of the earth, 2. Chron. 9. 23. All the
Kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that
God had put in his heart. So children should make use of the knowledge that is
in their parents, and move questions to them, Deuteronomy. 6. 20. When thy son shall
ask thee in time to come, what mean these ordinances, and testimonies, and
laws, which the Lord our God has commanded you? And wives should make use of
the knowledge God has given their husbands, above them, 1. Cor. 14. 35. If
they would learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home. But
specially the people of God should make use of his Ministers this way, not
only to hear them publicly, but privately to move questions to them, and to
enquire the will of God at them in all their doubts. For this means God has
sanctified above all others to that end. Mal. 2. 7. The Priests lips should
preserve knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth. Hag. 2. 12.
Ask now the Priests concerning the law. And so we shall find Gods people have
made great use of their Ministers gifts this way, even in private. Our Saviors
Disciples did so, Mar. 4. 10. and 7. 17. and 10. 10. So the Christians in
Corinth moved their doubts to Paul in sundry cases of conscience, 1. Cor. 7. 1.
10. 22. And at Ephesus he did much good in private houses, Acts 20. 20.

2. In respect of Gods Prophets. This is the best way whereby Christians may
yield comfort and encouragement unto good Ministers, when they make use of
their gifts, and show themselves desirous and ready to receive good by them.
See a notable example of this in Titus, his spirit was refreshed much by all
Gods people at Corinth, 2. Cor. 7. 13. how? by the use they made of his gifts,
they received him with great reverence, and were obedient to his doctrine, as
appears verse. 15. This has ever bin the mind and speech of a faithful
Minister, which Paul expresses, 2. Cor. 12. 14. I seek not yours, but you. The
Apostle, when he charge the faithful so to carry themselves toward their
Ministers, as they may do their work with joy, and not with grief, Heb. 13.
17. he tells them how they may do that, Obey them, and submit your selves. No
kindness that any can show us, can so bind us to them, as this, when they make
use of our Ministry, and profit by us. Mar. 3. 34, 35. He looked round about
on them, which sat in compass about him, and said, Behold my mother and my
brethren: For whosoever shall do the will of God, is my brother, etc. Nay, we
can have small comfort in the maintenance and countenance we have from such, as
receive no good by our Ministry. I cannot say it is unlawful for a Preacher,
to take maintenance from them that receive no good by his Ministry, so long as
he does his endeavor faithfully to do them good; but surely, a little
kindness received from the other, does him more good, and is sweeter to him
than a great deal from such men. They that Christ is said to receive
maintenance from, were such as made use of his Ministry, Luke 8. 3. And he
bids his Apostles, when they came into any city or town, to enquire who was
worthy in it, and there to abide, till they went thence, Matthew. 10. 11.

3. In respect of themselves: for this is the only sure argument that their
hearts are upright in the love they show unto Preachers, when they make use of
their gifts, and will be directed and ruled by them. By all other ways but
this, a man that has no grace may show love and kindness to Gods Minister.
Herod reverenced John, Mar. 6. 20. Nebuchadnezzar did patronize Jeremy, and
countenanced him, and maintained and provided liberally for him, Ier. 39. 11,
1^. yet had neither of these any grace in them.

The Use of this Doctrine, is for Reproof of diverse sorts of men, which all
Use.
of them pretend much love and respect to good Ministers, yet it is not with an
upright heart, or such as shall be able to yield them any sound comfort in the
evil day. 1 Such as love them, and will commend and countenance them, and
maintain them too; yet they seldom or never hear them, or make use of their
Ministry; and yet they bless themselves in this, as in a great sign of grace,
that they love and maintain good Preachers. To these men I say, this may
procure thee a temporal reward, as it did Potiphar to have Joseph in his
house, though he made no use of his knowledge and piety, Genesis 39. 5. God
blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake. But sound comfort this can never
yield thee; for thou receiuest not a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, Mat. 10.
41 but either out of a natural affection thou bear to the man, or carnal
respect thou have to thine own credit, or some light that thou have received
from Gods Word, that it is good to love Preachers, or some taste thou have had
of the power and sweetness of his Ministry, whom thou do thus affect; but
none of all these respects will yield a man any sound comfort, but rather be a
strong evidence against him in the day of the Lord. 2. Such as not only like,
and commend, and maintain Preachers, but hear them also ordinarily, yet never
make any use of their gifts in private, never move any questions to them, nor
seek to be directed and informed by them in the will of God, concerning any
their particular and private occasions. The will of God is, that the Minister
should be resident, and dwell upon his charge. He is called a watchman to the
house of Israel, Ezekiel. 3. 17. The Priests had therefore their lodgings
appointed them near the house of God, 1. Chro. 9. 27. for this cause (among
others) that the people, if they had any doubts to propound to them, and
occasion to enquire the will of God of them, might know where to find them.
But our Ministers may be non resident well enough, all the week long, for any
use the people will make of them this way, unless it be to baptize a child,
or bury a corpse, or visit one that is sick, they can spare him well enough.
And for visiting the sick, if he be such a one, as uses to deal plainly, and
will not suffer them to pass to hell in a dead sleep, he shall not be often
troubled that way: and when he comes, what use make they of him? Surely, they
use to propound no doubts to be resolved in, but only to have him pray, and
speak some comfortable words to them, they send for him. Of David we read,
that he kept always a Prophet about him, even when his state was but mean and
poor, yet had he the Prophet G^d with him, 1. Sa^. 22. 5. And why? To be
directed by him in the will of God, in all his occasions; as we may see as it
appears by his consulting with Nathan, 2. Sam. 7. 2. yea it may seem by that
which we read, 1. King. 1. 27. that he was never wont to undertake or resolve
upon any matter of great moment, till he had first consulted with the Prophet,
and enquired what the will of God was in that case.

And now adays also many keep good Prophets about them, but what use make they
of them? Surely, little more than they might do of a dumb Minister; yea, they
count it a disgrace to make a Prophet of their counsel in any thing.

Let a Minister be with them never so often at their Tables, never so long in
their houses, they will make no use of his gifts, seek no direction from him in
any case of conscience. Let a Lawyer be with them, they will make use of his
knowledge: let a Physician be with them, they will move some questions to him
concerning his art; only the Divine is the man they can make no use of. And
what is the reason of this? is it because they are full of knowledge, they know
as much as we can teach them? Indeed, conceitednesse is a great cause. But
(alas) there be many maine points in Religion, that they are very ignorant in.
What is then the chief cause? Surely, men have no care to please God, and to
know his will; if they had, they could not but have many doubts: when this care
was wrought in John's hearers, they came to him after this manner, what shall we
do? and what shall we do? Luke 3. 10. 12. 14.

And there is no man, that has a care to know Gods will, but he shall have
many doubts. There was never any proved a good scholar in any learning, but he
that had doubts, and would move questions. Neither is there any man, that has
a true care to please God, but he has many occasions in his life, to enquire
whether that he does be agreeable to the will of God, or no. In the times of
superstition, men gave too much to their Priests, when they thought no sin
could be pardoned, unless they confessed it to a Priest, and took his
direction for their repentance; but the profaneness of these times has
drawn men too far into the other extreme, that they have no need of the
Ministers direction in any thing.

3 Such as will indeed move questions, but they are curious (of such things as
God has not revealed in his Word) or at least vain and unprofitable, Tit. 3.
9.

4. Such as will move questions only to try the Ministers judgment, that they
may take advantage, either at his insufficiency, or at his dissent in judgment
from other Preachers, as the Scribes and Pharisees did unto our Savior, they
moved questions to him tempting him that they might have to accuse him, Ioh. 8.
(...).

5. Such as will hear and commend a good Preacher, and thank him even for such
Sermons, as wherein he has touched them most nearly, but will reform nothing,
nor practice what they hear, such were the Prophets hearers, they heard his
words but would not do them, with their mouths they showed much love, but their
heart went after their covetousness, Ez. 33. 31.

The third and last thing to be observed, in describing the beginnings of the
faith and conversion of the Samaritans, is the approbation Christ gave unto
them; He abode with them two days: which we shall not read he did upon the
entreatie of any other: and which showed his special love to them, and desire
he had to perfect the good work that was begun in them. Which teaches us this
doctrine: That they that unfeignedly desire to know the will of God, God will
prouid means for them, that they may be instructed. Two plain proofs Doct.
we have of this, in the example of the Eunuch. Act. 8. and Cornelius, Act. 10.

To confute the blasphemous Doctrine of the Papists, that deny the people can
grow to any certainty in the knowledge of Religion, or that they should Use 1.
be allowed to read the Scriptures.

2. To show the true cause why so many continue still under the heavy judgment
of a dumb Ministry; they are such as you may read of, even such as say unto
God, Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways, Job 21. 14.

But of this Doctrine we have formerly spoken at large; and therefore this
shall now suffice to be spoken of it.

THE SEVENTIETH LECTVRE, ON OCTOBER XXIII. MDCX.
IOH. IIII. XLI, XLII. And many more believed, because of his own Word.

And they said unto the Woman, Now we believe, not because of of thy saying,
for we have heard him our selves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the
Savior of the World.


WE have already heard, that in the two former verses, the Evangelist has set
down the beginnings of the Faith and Conversion of the Samaritans. By the
speech and persuasion of a poor Woman their Neighbor, many of them did
believe in Christ, and they testified and declared their Faith, by coming to
him, and beseeching him that he would tarry with them; and our Savior so far
approved of them for these beginnings of Faith, which he discerned in them,
that he yielded readily to their request, and abode with them two days. Now in
these words I have read unto you, the Evangelist sets down their increase and
proceedings in Faith, and what use they made of our Savior in those two days
that he spent among them. And in setting this down, he offers four
principal points to our consideration. 1. That by this abode which Christ made
among them, they increased greatly in the number of Believers: for many that
made no reckoning of the Woman's words, nor would (upon her persuasion) stir
out of their doors to go to him; yet when he was come unto them, and they had
heard him teach, believed in him: Many more believed, because of his own word.
2. That they increased greatly in the measure of their Faith also: for whereas
they that had believed in him, upon the Woman's speech, were but weak in Faith,
and not fully resolved, whether he were the Messia or no; now (by hearing him)
they were confirmed and fully assured, that he was indeed the Christ, the
Savior of the world. 3. The reason is set down why they did thus increase,
both in the number of Believers, and in the measure of their Faith, Because of
his own Word: because they had heard him themselves. 4. They make confession
of this their Faith, and certainty they were grown unto; as also of the
means, whereby they were brought unto it, unto the woman that was the first
instrument of their conversion, and profess plainly to her, that the good
they received by her was nothing to that which they had gotten by hearing him
themselves. They said unto the Woman, now we believe, not because of thy
saying, for we have heard him our selves.

First then we must observe here, that which the Evangelist speaks of, the
increase of the number of Believers among the Samaritans, in that short space
that Christ tarried with them. Many more believed because of his own Word.
From whence we learn:

That a man may be one of Gods Elect, though he cannot profit by some Doct. 1.
means of his salvation, that God offers unto him; though he do not profit by
the means of his salvation at the first. See the proof of this Doctrine,
first, in the example the Holy Ghost has given us in this place: 1. These
Samaritans, mentioned in the 41. verse, were the Elect of God, as well as those
mentioned in the two former verses, else they could not have believed. 2. Look
what means the other had to bring them to the faith, these had the very same:
for the woman had spoken, and persuaded, and dealt as earnestly with them as
with the other, verse. 28. when she ran from Christ into the city, She said
unto the men (that is, to all indifferently) Come and see, etc. 3. These had
had greater means to bring them to Christ than the other: for (beside the
speech of the Woman) they had also the example of many of their Neighbors to
provoke them. 4. Yet neither the Woman's speech, nor their Neighbors example,
could prevail with them: but when they had heard Christ themselves, then they
believed on him.

Now before I proceed further in the confirmation of this Doctrine, three
Cautions must be first premised, to prevent the mistaking of it. 1. All whom
God means to save (ordinarily) shall have the means of grace vouch safed unto
them, at one time or other, and shall have also grace given unto them to profit
by them. Other sheep I have (says our Savior, John 10. 16.) which are not of
this Fold, them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice. And again,
verse. 27. My sheep hear my voice. And as it is a good sign, God has an
Elect people in that place that he gives the means of grace unto (as is
plain by that reason he gives to Paul why he would have him continue in
Corinth, for I have much people (says he) in this city, Acts 18. 9, 10.) and
on the other side an evil sign, that a people are such as God has no
gracious eye or respect unto, when he denies them the means of grace, the
time of this ignorance (while he denied to the people that lived in that time
the means of grace) God regarded not, Acts 17. 30. So is it also a good sign
of Election to every particular person, when God gives him not only the means
of grace, but also a heart to profit by them, so many as were ordained unto
life believed, Acts 13. 48. and the contrary is a fearful sign of
Reprobation, when God giving to a man the means of grace, denies him a heart
to profit by them, ye therefore hear not because ye are not of God, Ioh. 7.
47. I know that God has determined to destroy thee (says the Prophet to
Amaziah) because thou have done this, and have not hearkened unto my counsel,
2. Chron. 25. 16. 2. It is a comfortable sign of a man's election, when he
receives the Word with all readiness, and his heart makes answer unto God so
soon as he calls upon him, when thou said, seek ye my face, my heart said
unto thee, thy face Lord will I seek, Psalm. 27. 8. These were more noble then
those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, Acts
17. 11. And on the other side it is a dangerous sign of Reprobation, when a
man does wilfully put the Lord off, and takes day with him. He that refuses
thus to come when God calls him, has just cause to fear, God will call him
no more, Because I have purged thee (used the means, and endeavored to purge
thee) and thou wast not purged; thou shall not be purged from thy filthiness
any more, Ezekiel. 24. 13. 3. The Lord has been wont, when he has given the
means of grace to a people, to make them effectual to the Conversion of so
many as he means to save, within a very short time after they have first
enjoyed them. And (if we observe this well) we shall find, that such Preachers
as God has made most fruitful in their Ministry, have converted more to God,
at their first coming to a People; and that their labors afterward, have
served rather to confirm and build men forward, than to convert them. It is
noted of Peter's Ministry, Acts 10. 44. that even while he was preaching unto
Cornelius, and those that were there assembled, the Holy Ghost fell upon all
them that heard the Word. And Paul, Phil. 1. 5. speaking of the success of his
ministry among the Philippians, praises God for the fellowship they had in the
Gospel from the first day (that he had preached unto them) until then. And he
twice puts the Thessalonians in mind of their state when he came first among
them. 1 Thessalonians. 1. 9. They show what manner of entering in we had unto you, and
how ye turned from Idols to God, to serve the living and true God: and 2. 1.
Your selves, Brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain.
As if he should have said unto them, O those were comfortable times. So does he
put the Galathians in mind of the great success his Ministry had among them,
at his first coming unto them, Gal. 4. 13, 14, 15. So the Holy Ghost speaking
of the first Sermons that Paul and Barnabas preached to the Gentiles at
Antioch, says, Acts 13. 48. that at the hearing of them, as many as were
ordained to eternal life (among them) believed.

These Cautions being premised; we shall (yet) find the Doctrine to be most
true, That even among the Elect themselves, there is great difference to be
observed, in their receiving and profiting by the means of their first
Conversion unto God.

See the proof and confirmation of this Doctrine in three several points.

1. A man may be the Elect Child of God, and be a fruitless hearer of some
good Preachers, and yet profit by some other. The Ministry of John the Baptist
was a very holy and powerful Ministry, and the whole drift of it was to draw
men to believe in Christ; and yet many of Gods Elect that had heard him, could
not be converted by him to the Faith, which yet afterward, when they came to be
hearers of Christ himself, became true Believers, and said, John did no
miracle, but all things that John spoke of this man were true. And many
believed on him there, John. 10. 41, 42. So it is evident, that many of those
five thousand that were converted by two Sermons that Peter made, Acts 4. 4.
had heard Christ himself preach sundry times (as is plain by Luke 19. 48. and
21. 38. where it is said that at Christ's preaching in the Temple, (immediately
before his Passion) all the people resorted daily to him to hear him) yet
could not be converted by him. By stronger and more excellent means they could
not be converted, and yet were converted by weaker means.

2. A man may be a fruitless Hearer a long time, even of that Ministry that
God has ordained to convert him by, and yet afterward profit by it. With many
of his Elect the Lord has been feign to stand long at the door and knock
(as he speaks, Revel. 3. 20.) before he could get entrance into their hearts;
to continue the means long unto them before they have profited by them. Many
of Gods children have been like young Samuel, 1. Sam. 3. 10, the Lord has
called them often by the Ministry of his Word, before they could answer him, or
once discern that it was he that spoke unto them. There has been many a one
that has been a hearer a long time, before he has been won unto God; yea,
that has heard the same Preacher many a time without all fruit, by whose
Ministry at the last he has been converted unto God. There were many of Gods
Elect that heard that powerful Sermon of Peter, mentioned Acts 2. and profited
not by it; which yet hearing him at another time were converted by him: for
those two thousand that we read were added to the Church in Jerusalem, Acts 4.
4. and that by his Ministry, as may appear (Acts 3. 12. 48.) had certainly
heard that Sermon, and seen also the fruit of it, as is plain by that we
read, Act. 2. 5, 6. for the multitude of them that were in Jerusalem heard
that Sermon.

3. A man may be the Elect child of God, though he can receive no good by the
most powerful and fruitful Ministry, till God have prepared him by humbling
him greatly through fore affliction. Paul himself may be a notable example for
this. It is not to be doubted, but that he, living in Jerusalem while all the
Apostles continued there (for he was brought up in that City at the feet of
Gamaliel, Acts 22. 3. and there he gave consent to the death of Steven, Acts 8.
1. and there he began to persecute the Saints, Act. 26. 10, 11.) and the
Church did so flourish there, did hear the Apostles preach sometimes, and
heard Steven dispute with the Libertines, and Cyrenians, Acts 6. 9. and yet,
till God by his mighty hand had humbled him, all this did him no good at all.

The Reasons and grounds of this Doctrine are principally three:

1. The Elect of God have no better hearts by nature, than the worst of all the
Reprobate have. Till God be pleased to call them, to open their Reason.
ears, and incline their hearts, they are every whit as backward and untoward
as the worst: they are by nature the children of wrath, even as others, Ephesians 2
3.

2. The Conversion of Gods Elect depends wholly upon the free pleasure and will
of Almighty God, and not upon any thing that is in man himself. The Wind
blows (says our Savior, John 3. 8.) where it lists, (and when it lists
also) so is every one that is bor^e of God. Of his own will (says the
Apostle, James 1. 18.) begat he us, with the word of Truth.

3. The Lord has herein had respect unto his own glory. Which this way is
better seen and manifested than otherwise it could be: for if all the Elect
should profit by every good Minister of God, or if they should profit presently
so soon as ever they do enjoy the means of grace; certainly the glory of
this mighty work of God would be ascribed either to the means, or unto some
good inclination that is in our own hearts, and not to the Lord himself only.

This Doctrine we may make good Use of, both toward our selves, and toward
others also. First, let no man abuse this Doctrine unto Presumption, Use.
and say, I may be Gods Elect child, though Ineuer received good yet by any
Sermon in my life: But let every man account it a fearful sign, and a just
cause of trembling, if God have given him good means of grace, and he has
enjoyed them long, even such means as he has seen many others have received
great good by, and yet he cannot profit by them, he cannot believe and obey the
truth. For, 1. It is no small sin to neglect, or not to receive good by the
means of grace. If it were, our Savior would not have spoken of it as he did,
Matthew. 10. 15. Uerily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for the Land
of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of Judgment than for that City. 2. If a man
do wittingly neglect to regard and obey the means of grace presently, so soon
as God offers them unto him, while it is called to day, he is in danger to be
given up of God unto hardness of heart, Heb. (...). 13. 3. Though it be not
always (as we have heard in the Doctrine) yet it is for the most part a sign
of a man that God has not ordained to life, but determined to destroy, to
enjoy long excellent means of Conversion and Repentance, and to receive no
good by them, as I showed you even now out of Ioh. 8. 47. and 2. Chron. 25. 16.
And as is also plain by that speech the Lord uses, Pro. 1. 24. 28, 29.
because I have called and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand and no man
regarded; They shall call upon me, but I will not answer, they shall seek me
early but shall not find me, because they hated knowledge.

Secondly, let us learn by this, to praise God, for the great variety and
choice of worthy Ministers that we may hear. Take notice of the gracious
respect God has had to thee in it. As he has provided for every age, for
every constitution, bodily food that may be fit for it; so has he done for thy
soul. If thou can not profit by one, thou may by another. Despise not
therefore the Ministry of any of Gods servants, but hear all, esteem of all:
for what know thou which is the Preacher, or which is the Sermon that God
has appointed to work thy salvation by? That which the Apostle says, 1. Cor.
3. 5. is often to be thought upon by Gods people: We are the Ministers by whom
you must be brought to Faith; but which of us is the man by whom this work
shall be wrought in any of you, that depends wholly upon the will of God, as
God shall give to every man.

Secondly, toward others also, this doctrine teaches us how to stand
affected: we that are Ministers must not be discouraged, because we see 2.
so little fruit of our labors in them that hear us. They that are most
untoward, may profit by us one day, though they do not yet: we must therefore
according to that of the Apostle, 2. Tim. 2. 25. instruct still the worst of
them with meekeness, proving if God at any time will give them Repentance. We
must hearken to that counsel of Solomon (though given by him in another case,
and to another purpose) Eccles. 11. 6. In the morning sow thy seed, and in the
evening withhold not thine hand: for thou know not whether shall prosper,
either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good. 2. Thou that art
a private Christian, learn not to despair of any how ignorant, unreformed, or
profane soever they be, so long as God is pleased to give them the means of
grace, and makes them willing to hear; but hope well of them. When John
Baptist saw the Pharisees and Sadduces come to his Ministry, though he knew
them to be most wicked men (even a generation of Vipers, Matthew. (...). 7.) yet
does he note this to be a good sign in them, a sign that somebody had warned
them to fly from the wrath to come.

Lecture the seventy one. November 13. 1610. JOHN IIII. XLII.
THe last day we heard that the Evangelist describes in these two Verses
(this, and the former) the use and profit that the Samaritans of Sychar made of
our Savior Christ, in those two days that (upon their earnest entreatie) he
made his abode with them. And therein observes, 1. How the number of Believers
increased among them in that time. 2. How they that before had begun to
believe through the speech and persuasion of the Woman, did increase in the
strength and measure of their Faith, in this short time that he spent among
them. The former of these two points is set down in the 41. Verse, which we
handled and finished the last day. Now we are to proceed unto the latter, which
is contained in this verse. Wherein we are to observe four principal points:
1. The object of their faith, that is, the thing they believed, viz. That he
was the Christ, the Savior of the World. 2. The certainety of their faith, We
know he is indeed the Christ, etc. 3. The means whereby they were brought unto
this certainety or ground, whereon they did build this their faith, viz. his
own Word, We have heard him our selves. 4. The fruit and effect whereby they
declared this increase and measure of their faith, namely, the Profession they
made, both of this certainty they were grown unto, and of the means whereby
it was wrought in them; unto the Woman that had been the first instrument of
their Conversion. Of these points we will speak in order.

And for the first, touching the object of their faith, the thing they
believed. Before we can receive our instruction from it, two doubts are to be
resolved, for the better understanding of the words: 1. Whether this was a
saving and justifying faith, to believe thus in general concerning Christ,
that he was the Savior of the World. 2. Whether they did believe, that all men
should be saved, as their words seem to import.

For answer to the first, I say: 1. That this had not been a justifying Faith,
or such as would have saved them, if they had only believed thus Quest. 1.
in general, and been fully persuaded, that Christ is the Savior of the
World, unless they had also believed in particular, that he was their Savior:
for thus much many Reprobates, and the Devils themselves have been persuaded
of. Thus much Caiphas could see, and did prophecy of, John 11. 51, 52. that
Jesus should dye, not for that Nation only, but that all Gods children, that
were scattered abroad, should be gathered into one by him. Thus much the
Devil did know and profess, Luke 4. 41. Thou art the Christ, the Son of
God. The Faith of Gods Elect is more particular than so: it inableth every
faithful man, to apply Christ to himself, and to rely upon him, to trust,
and put his affiance in him, for his own salvation: it makes him able to say,
Esaias 9. 6. To us a Child is borne, to us a Son is given: and with Thomas,
John 20. 28. Thou art my Lord, and my God: and with Paul, Gal. 2. 20. He loved
me, and gave himself for me. No man can be saved by the blood of Christ,
unless it be thus sprinkled and applied to him by the Spirit of God. 1. Pet.
1. 2. Elect unto Sanctification, through the obedience, and sprinkling of the
blood of Jesus Christ. It is therefore called, Heb. 12. 24. The blood of
sprinkling. Therefore true Faith is called a believing in his Name, John 1. 12.
Romans 4. 5.

2. Under these general words, their particular, and justifying Faith was
implied. As if they should have said, We know indeed he is the Savior of the
world, therefore our Savior. So in the Confession that Peter made of his
Faith, Matthew. 16. 16. though the words be general, and none other than the
Devil used, Luke 4 41. Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God: yet
in his heart he made particular application of them to himself, or else Christ
would not have answered as he did, verse 17. So in the Articles of our Faith
that concern the Church: though the words be general, and such as an
Hypocrite may say without hypocrisy, and believe; yet the faithful makes
particular application of them to himself. As if he should say, I believe
this, and know it belongs to me, and take comfort in it.

For answer to the second Question, I say, their meaning could not be as their
words seem to import: but by the World, they mean all the Quest. 2.
Elect of God, that were to be gathered out of the whole world. This answer
shall be cleared, and confirmed unto you in three Points: 1. That the World in
this place cannot possibly be taken for all mankind. 2. That by the World may
well be meant the Elect only, that are scattered throughout the World, 3. The
Reason why the Holy Ghost (intending only to teach that Christ is the Savior
of all the Elect) uses this Phrase to express it by, and calls him the Savior
of the World.

1. That the world in this Place cannot be taken for all mankind, is evident:
because then, this sentence should be contrary to many other plain places,
which teach us, that Christ is not the Savior of all mankind. For it is
expressly said in Scripture, 1. That many in the world shall not be saved by
him. Matthew. 7. 22, 23. Many will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we
not by thy Name prophesied, etc. And then will I profess to them, I never knew
you. 2. Yea, that the greatest part of men in the world shall not be saved by
him, wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and
many there be, that go in thereat, because straight is the gate and narrow is
the way that leads unto life, and few there be that find it, Matthew. 7. 13,
14. 3. That he shall be an occasion of damnation to many in the world. Romans 9.
32. 3. They have stumbled at the stumbling stone, as it is written, B^held I
lay in Zion a stumbling stone, and a rock to make men fall. 4. God does not so
much as offer Christ, nor make him known to all men in the world. For as it
was under the Law, he has not dealt so with any nation, and as for his
judgments they have not known them, Psalm. 147. 20. so may it truly be said,
that in every age since, there has been many thousand souls, that never so
much as heard of the name of Christ. As he did by immediate Reueration, forbid
his Apostles to go unto some people, Act. 16. 6, 7. So still by his providence
he withholds the means of grace frommany, He does in this case with the
heavenly rain of his Word, as he often does with the natural rain, I caused it
(says he) to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another
city, one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not
withered, Amos 4. 7. 5. Christ desired not that all men in the world, nor that
the most men in the world, should have benefit by his death. Ioh. 17. 9. I pray
for them, I pray not for the world, but for them that thou have given me, for
they are thine. Thus have I made it evident, that when Christ is here called
the Savior of the world, it cannot be meant, that he is the Savior of al men
in the world.

2. Now for the second point, that by the world here, may well be meant the
Elect only that are scattered throughout the world, is as plain. First,
because 2.
the like general speeches are so taken in other places, Look unto me and be
ye saved all the ends of the earth, unto me every knee shall bow, and every
tongue shall swear, Esaias, 45. 22, 23. and All Kings shall fall down before
him: all nations shall serve him, Ps. 72. 11. Secondly, because in many places
of Scripture the benefit of Christ's death is restrained, and limited to a
peculiar and choice company. Esaias 53. 6. He has laid on him the iniquity of us
all. Mat. 1. 21. He is called Jesus, because he shall save his people from
their sins. Ioh. 10. 15. I lay down my life for my sheep. Ephesians. 5. 23. He is
the savior of his body. Thirdly, because in other places of Scripture, by the
world is meant the whole company of Gods Elect only. Ioh. 6. 33. The bread of
God is he, which comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world. 2.
Cor. 5. 19. God was in Christ, and reconciled the world to himself not
imputing their sins unto them. Will any say, that he has given life unto, or
reconciled unto God all persons in the world?

3. To come to the Reasons why the Holy Ghost (intending to say no more but
this, that Christ is the Savior of all the Elect) expresses it not 3.
in those terms, which one would think were more plain, but says he is the
Savior of the world. 1. John 4. 14. The Father has sent his Son to be the
Savior of the world. John 3. 16. God so loved the world. Ioh. 1. 29. and 6.
51. I give my flesh for the life of the world, not for our sins only but for
the sins of the whole world, 1. John 2. 2. God will have all men to be saved,
and he gave himself a ransom for all, 1. Tim. 2. 4. 6. He tasted death for
every man, Heb. 2. 9.

The Reasons hereof, are these:

1. To express that the number of the Elect, the number of those that shall be
saved by Christ, should be exceeding great, according to that promise, Genesis 13.
16. I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth. And 15. 5. Innumerable, as
the stars in the firmament. For so when we would express that a thing is
commonly known, we are wont to say, All the world knows it. And so the
Scripture it self speaks, Ioh. 12. 19. The world goes after him. Romans 1. 8.
Published throughout the whole world. So Mat. 3. 5, 6. It is said that all
Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, went out to John, and were
baptized of him.

2. To show the better, that Christ and his Merits, should belong not to the
Jews only, but to the Gentiles, to some of all parts and corners of the
world, some of all sorts and conditions of men. This was necessary to be
taught, and expressed in most significant terms, specially in those times,
wherein Christ and the Apostles lived; both because the Jews for a long time
had been the only people of God, and all of other Nations might judge
themselves excluded, as all the Gentiles are called strangers, and brought in
complaining, Esaias 56. 3. The Lord has surely separated me from his people: as
also because Christ, while he was on earth, seemed to have been sent only to
the lost sheep of the house of Israel, Matthew. 15. 24. Now the Lord could not
in more significant terms have expressed this, That the Lord had his Elect,
not among the Jews only, but also among the Gentiles, in all sorts and
conditions of men; than by saying, Christ is the Savior of the World. And this
is certainly the Apostles meaning both in 1. John 2. 2. not for our sins
only (that are Jews, and have been his ancient people, and to whom he was
first and chiefly sent) but also for the sins of the whole world, of his elect
Gentiles dispersed throughout the whole world. And in 1. Tim. 2. 4. who will
have all men of all sorts some of Kings and such as are in authority (though
they be yet strangers and enemies to the truth) to be saved. And Tit. 2. 11.
the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared unto all men, to men and
women, old and young, Ministers and people, servants and masters. As if he
should have said, Not us only that are already called, but even many of those
that are yet unconverted, that are strangers from the Commonwealth of Israel,
and enemies to the truth. And, lest this interpretation should seem strange,
we shall find the same phrase so taken, Genesis 41. 57. All Countries came to
Egypt to buy Corn of Ieseph: that is, of every Country some.

3. That by this kind of speech, the Elect might be the better encouraged to
take hold on Christ; and that this might be a help against their weakness,
doubts, and discouragements, when they hear the merit of Christ propounded in
the Gospel in so large and general terms. This is used as a Reason to
encourage the abiects of the Gentiles, Esaias 45. 20. to believe in Christ: verse.
22. Look unto me, and ye shall be saved; all the ends of the earth shall be
saved. And this may seem to be the principal thing that encouraged these
Samaritans to believe in Christ; because they heard him teach in those two
days that he spent amongst them, that he was sent of God to be a Savior to
all the world: and that therefore they had no cause to doubt but that they
might have benefit by him, they might be saved by him, as well as others.

The Doctrine then we are to learn here, is this:

That though all men shall not be saved by Christ; yet is He in the Ministry
Doct. 1.
of the Gospel to be offered to all in most general manner, without excepting
or excluding of any. So did our Savior in this place teach the Samaritans. So
did he in all places wheresoever he preached, Repent you (says he to all) and
believe the Gospel, that is, that you shall be saved by my merits, Mar. 1. 15.
for so the Angel defines the Gospel, Luke 2. 10, 11. I bring you good tidings
((...)) of great joy which shall be to all people. And what is this good
tidings this (...), this Gospel? that he tells us in the next words, that unto
you is borne this day in the city of David a Savior which is Christ the Lord.
And so he commanded his Apostles to do, Go ye into all the world and preach
the Gospel unto every creature, Mark 16. 15.

Object. 1. The Law is to be preached to some, and not the Gospel.

Answ. True, it is: No hope of mercy by Christ is to be given to any man,
whilst he continues impenitent, the law (the doctrine of the law, of the rigor
and curse of it) is made (is appointed and ordained) for the lawless and
disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, etc. 1. Tim, 1. 9, 10. yet to the
wretchedest man that is in the world, we are to offer Christ, and to give him
hope that he may have part in Christ, if the fault be not in himself. Luke 14.
21. Bring in hither the poor and maimed, etc. and verse 23. Compel them to
come in.

Object. 2. How can we say, that Christ belongs to all, since we know he belongs
only to the Elect; and we are not sure who are Elect?

Answ. 1. Though we are sure there are Reprobates in the Church; yet there is
no particular person that lives in the Church, but we are to judge and hope he
is one of Gods Elect. So the Apostle judges of all the strangers he wrote
unto, he calls all the strangers, the Jews that professed the Gospel
throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithinia, elect according to
the foreknowledge of God, 1. Pet. 1. 2. So Paul (in the judgment of charity)
says of some, that (through scandal given to them) might perish, that they
were such as Christ dyed for, 1. Cor. 8. 11.

2. God has commanded us to offer his Gospel to every particular person, unto
whom he sends us, and that lives in his Church. His secret decree he keeps to
himself, his revealed will is, that we should offer Christ to every one, Mar.
16. 1^. As (on the contrary side) when he sent Esaias to Hezekiah, Esaias 38. 1.
and Jonah to Nineveh, Jonah 3. 4. he bids them preach death and destruction
unto such, as he yet in his secret decree intended should live.

3. We are sure that every one, to whom we offer Christ, shall indeed have
benefit by Christ, unless his own infidelity, and rejecting of Christ do
hinder him, John 3. 18. He that belieueth on him is not condemned; but he that
believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of
the only begotten Son of God.

Reason. No man that knows his own unworthiness, and how far he has
provoked Almighty God, can be encouraged to believe, unless the Gospel be in
this general manner propounded to him, unless by this means hope be given
him, that he may have benefit by Christ, that the promise belongs even to him.
And that (as I have told you) is the cause of the speech, Esaias 45. 22. and so
it is likewise of those, The promise is to you and to your children, and to all
that are afar of, even as many as the Lord our God shall call, Act. 2. 39. ye
are the children of the Prophets and of the Covenant which God made with our
fathers, Act. 3. 25.

Use. 1. For the terror of the presumptuous sinner, that imboldens himself in
sin by this conceit, that Christ dyed for all men, and that it is an easy
thing for him to believe when he lists.

2. For the comfort of the humbled sinner, that doubts he is so wretched a
sinner, that he can have no benefit by Christ, ^e cannot believe that ever
Christ died for him.

Lecture the seventy two. November 20. 1610. JOHN IIII. XLII.
We heard the last day, that in this Verse is set down how these Samaritans
that had begun to believe upon the speech of the Woman their Neighbor, were
confirmed and strengthened in their Faith, by hearing of Christ himself, in
those two days that he made his abode with them. And that there be four
principal points to be observed in it: 1. The object of their faith, the thing
that they believed, viz. That he was the Christ the Savior of the world. 2.
The certainty of their faith; We know (say they) that he is indeed the Christ.
3. The means whereby they were brought unto this certainty, or ground whereon
they did build their faith; not the saying of the woman, but the hearing of him
themselves. 4. The fruit, and effect whereby they declared this their faith,
namely the profession they make of it unto the woman that had been the first
instrument to draw them unto Christ. The first of these four points we handled
and finished the last day: it follows now that we proceed unto the second.
From this then that these Samaritans making here profession of their faith; in
Jesus Christ, i. e. declare their faith by the certainty of their knowledge,
and express what they meant by saying they did believe in this manner, Now we
believe, for we know that this is indeed the Christ; we learn:

That there is great certainty and assurance in true faith. It is more than an
Doct. 2.
opinion, than a conjecture, than to hope well: it is a certain and undoubted
persuasion of the heart.

This you shall find true in all the kinds of true Faith which the Scripture
speaks of.

1. They that had the Faith of Miracles, never attempted the doing of any
Miracle, but they were certain they should effect it. And therefore Christ
told his Disciples, that the cause why they could not cast out a Devil, Matthew.
17. 19, 20. was, that at that time they had not the Faith of Miracles, in any
measure: if they had had so much of it, as a grain of mustard seed, they
might have been assured to prevail in that great work.

2. They that have an Historical Faith, are certainly and fully assured, that
all that God has revealed in his Word is undoubtedly true. They are certain,
that Christ was the Son of God. John 17. 8. They have known surely that I am
come from thee, and they have believed that thou did send me. They are
certain of every Commandment God has revealed to them in his Word; That they
may not do any thing of their own works on the Lords day; that they may not
revenge themselves, etc. They are undoubtedly persuaded, that every curse
threatened in the Word against the wicked, shall certainly light upon them; and
that every blessing promised to the godly, shall undoubtedly be performed to
them: though reason, sense, and experience be never so much against it, yet are
they fully persuaded of it, because God has said it. Therefore the Apostle
calls faith, Heb. 11. 1. An evidence of things not seen. Two notable instances
are given us for this: 1. Concerning the Beginning and Creation of the World.
2. Concerning the End and Dissolution of it. The one we have, Heb. 11. 3.
Through Faith we understand that the World was ordained by the Word of God. So
that as certainly as we are persuaded that there is now a Sun in the
Firmament, whose rising, and approaching to us causes the day, whose setting,
and departing from us causes the night (because our sense teaches us this;)
so are we every whit as certainly persuaded, that there were sundry days and
nights, before there was any Sun to rise or set in the world, because God
has said so in his Word, that there were three days before the Sun was
Created, Genesis 1. 13, 14. 2. The other instance, for the certainety of this
Historical faith, is, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 2. Ye your selves know perfectly that the
day of the Lord shall come.

3. He that has a true justifying faith, may not only hope well, and
conjecture, but he may be certainly and undoubtedly persuaded, that Christ and
all his merits do belong unto him: he may be in this life certainly assured,
that he shall be saved.

Now because this is the faith, that my Text speaks of, and this is a point,
that it much concerns us all to be well instructed in; I will be larger in
speaking of this kind of Faith, than of the former two. And before I come to
the proof of this point, I will give you four Cautions, which shall preserve
you from mistaking and misunderstanding this Doctrine; and which may serve for
answer to all the material objections, that are made against it.

1. Though we say, that every true Believer may be certain of his own
salvation; yet do we grant, there are degrees of Faith and knowledge; that all
Believers are not in the like measure certain of their salvation: neither may
any from this Doctrine conclude, I am but an Hypocrite, I have no true Faith,
because I have not the certainety that such, and such I read of in the Word,
had; because I cannot do as such and such can. For God gives all his graces in
diverse measures, even to his Elect ones, according to his own good pleasure.
Matthew. 13. 23. The seed of the Word in some brings forth an hundred fold, in
some but sixty, in some but thirty. One has a strong Faith, as Abraham, Romans
4. 19, 20. and the Woman of Canaan, Matthew. 15. 28. Another a weak Faith, as
the man whose child was possessed, Mar. 9. 24. A little Faith, as the
Disciples, Matthew. 8. 26. And yet this weak, this little Faith, is as true a
Faith, as effectual to justification and salvation (though it yield not a man
that measure of certainety and comfort) as the other. It is the truth and
soundness, not the measure and quantity of Faith, that saues us.

2. They that have attained to the strongest Faith, to the greatest measure of
Faith, cannot be so certain of their salvation, but they shall have some
doubts, and some distrust left in them. The Thessalonians are commended for
their Faith above all the Churches; yet it is said of them, that they had
somewhat lacking in their faith, 1 Thessalonians. 3. 10. Yea, Paul himself was not
perfect in faith, not as though I had already attained it, either were already
perfect says he, Phil. 3. 12. It is a good sign of true Faith, to discern,
grieve, and strive against doubts, and motions of distrust. He may be sure he
has no true Faith, that feels not infidelity in himself: Yea, a man may have
at the same time both Faith and doubting: Lord I believe, help thou mine
unbelief, Mar. 9. 24. yet does this doubting proceed, not from the spirit, but
from the flesh, from the unregenerate part: neither is it a virtue, as Papists
would have it, or a property of true Faith; but a thing most contrary and
opposite to the nature of it. True Faith has certainety in it, and excludes
all doubtings. James 3. 5. Let him ask in Faith, and waver not. Matthew. 21. 21.
If ye have faith, and doubt not. Matthew. 14. 31. O thou of little faith,
wherefore did thou doubt?

3. They that have the strongest Faith, feel not this certainty of their
salvation at all times; but may (for a time) be quite deprived of the feeling
of it. As the Apostle says, 1. Pet. 1. 6. Ye greatly rejoice in your faith,
though now for a season (if need be) ye are in heaviness through manifold
tentations. They that before were most full of confidence and assurance, yet in
tentation show much weakness, Matthew. 14. See Peter's confidence, verse. 28, 29.
see his weakness, verse 30. Eliah that before feared not to meet Ahab, and
deal so roundly with him, a while after quaked and fled at the threat of
Iezabel, and grew impatient, 1. King. 19. 3, 4. David sometimes was full of
confidence and certainety, and could say, as Psalm. 27. 1. The Lord is my light
and salvation, whom shall I fear? And 23. 4. Yea, though I should walk
through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art
with me. At another time you shall hear him complain, Psalm. 55. 5. Fear and
trembling are come upon me, and an horrible fear has covered me. Yea, 31, 22.
I am cut off from before thine eyes. So you shall have the Church, and Spouse
of Christ, the Mother of us all, sometimes (in fullness of assurance) glorying,
as Cant. 2. 6. My well-beloved is mine, and I am his. At another time you shall
hear her complain, as Cant. 5. 6. My well-beloved is gone, I sought him, but I
could not find him, I called him, but he answered me not.

4. The man that has the strongest Faith may, and ought to live in continual
fear. Without this we can never work out our salvation, Phil. 2. 12. In which
respect, it is said to be the happiness of a man, if he can nourish in
himself a fear to fall, and offend God continually, Pro. 28. 14. For first,
though he be sure God will never quite cast him off, nor disinherit him; yet he
knows withal, it is possible for him to fall into heinous sins, yea even as
heinous (for the outward act) as they can do that want all grace. And even to
this, that may be applied which Solomon speaks in another sense, Eccles. 9.
2. All things come alike to all. 2. He knows, that if he do thus fall, he
shall offend, and grieve his heavenly Father: which a good Child will be
afraid to do: there is a fear of his father, even in the most gracious
child; ye shall fear every man his mother and his father, Leuit. 19. 3. 3.
He knows, that if he sin against God, though he cannot be dis-inherited; yet
he may be grievously scourged: he may lose his certainety, and feeling of Gods
favor, which is dearer to him than his life. Psalm. 63. 3. Thy loving kindness
is better than life. He may bring upon himself many fearful plagues both
spiritual and temporal, God is very terrible in the assembly of the Saints,
Psalm. 89. 7. therefore he lives in continual fear. But this fear stands well
enough with the assurance and certainety of salvation, it hinders it not, but
furthereth it greatly, for it is the chief means to preserve them from
falling away, Ier. 32. 40. I will put my fear in their hearts that they shall
not depart from me, such fear makes us the fitter to do any service unto God;
and therefore hinders not our assurance or comfort in God, but furthers it
much; a man may rejoice in such trembling, serve the Lord with fear and
rejoice in trembling, Psalm. 2. 11. Thou stand by Faith, be not high minded,
but fear.

These four points being thus premised: let us now come to the confirmation of
the Doctrine, That by a true Faith a man may be in this life certain and sure
of his salvation. And I will confirm it to you three ways: 1. By declaring to
you the profession that the Faithful have made of the certainety they have
found in themselves of their own salvation. 2. Then by the effects it has
wrought in them, whereby they have declared themselves to be indeed as
certain, as they have made show of. 3. By giving you the reasons, why it must
needs be so, that they that have true Faith, are indeed certain of their
salvation. And for the first; mark the marvelous certainty the faithful have
ever made profession of. 1. They were sure that Christ, with all his merits,
did belong to them, Job 19. 25. I am sure that my Redeemer lives. 2. They were
sure of the forgiveness of their sins, and of the imputation of Christ's
perfect righteousness, Esaias 45. 24. He shall say surely in the Lord have I
righteousness and strength, 3. They were sure God was become their Father
through him, Esaias 63. 16. Doubtless thou art our Father, though Abraham be
ignorant of us. 4. They were sure, that after this life they should inherit
eternal life, we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands eternal in
the heavens, 2. Cor. 5. 1. ye know in your selves that ye have in heaven a
better, and an enduring substance, Heb. 10. 34. 1. John 3. 14. We know, that we
are translated from death to life, because we love the brethren. 5. They were
sure that all things (their prosperity, adversity, yea their tentations and
sins) should in the end work for their good, we know that all things work
together for good to them that love God, Romans 8. 28. 6. They were sure, they
should persevere in Gods favor to the end of their life, and never fall away
finally, This God is our God for ever and ever; he will be our guide, even unto
death, Psalm. 48. 14. I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust
in the mercy of God for ever and ever, Psalm. 52. 8. Surely shall one say, in
the Lord have I righteousness and strength, not righteousness only and pardon
of my sins, but strength also to uphold me and make me persevere in the state
of grace, Esaias 45. 24. Psalm. 23. 6. Doubtless, kindness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life. Romans 8. 38. 29. I am persuaded, that
neither death, nor life, etc. shall be able to separate us from the love of God
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. In which words observe: 1. That he speaks
thus confidently, not of himself alone, but of all the faithful, verse 39.
Us. 2. That the ground on which he builds this assurance, is not any special
revelation, but such a foundation as is common to all the faithful, namely
because God spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, verse 32.
because it is God that has justified us, ver. 33. because it is Christ that
died, yea rather that is risen again; who is even at the right hand of God,
who also makes intercession for us, verse 34. 3. Though the Faith of the
meanest Christian be in degree and measure different from that which was in
Paul; yet is it in nature all one with his, and as effectual to save him as
Paul's was, 2. Pet. 1. 1. that have obtained the like precious Faith with us.

Lecture the seventy three. November 27. 1610. JOHN IIII. XLII.
Follows now that we come unto the effects, which true faith has wrought in
Gods children, whereby they have declared themselves to be certain of their
salvation. And there be four effects it does work in all true believers,
which do evidently argue, that it is a certain persuasion of Gods favor, and
of eternal life.

The first is peace of conscience; it works sound peace in the conscience,
John ^4. 27. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, not as the world
gives, give I unto you. This peace is Christ's peace, his gift; and that no
common gift. It is another manner of peace, than that that is in worldly men.
1. It is a sounder, and a greater, and a more hearty peace than theirs is,
Psalm. 4. 7, 8. Thou have put gladness into my heart, more than (they have) in
the time that their corn and wine increases: I will lay me down in peace,
etc. 2. It makes the heart quiet and secure, not only in time of health and
prosperity, but even in time of greatest danger and affliction. Psalm. 112. 7,
8. He shall not be afraid of evil tidings, his heart is fixed trusting in
the Lord, his heart is established. Yea in the time of tentation, and inward
affliction of mind, 2. Cor. 5. 6. We are always confident. He means not at
all times (for this peace may be for a time interrupted) but in all estates.
Matthew. 7. 25. The rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew,
and beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock. 3.
It frees the heart from slavish fear, not only of the rage and power of men
(as it did those three noble Jews, Dan. 3. 16. and the Martyrs) but it makes
the heart secure and quiet, even against the sense of Gods wrath due to sin.
Romans 5. 1. Being justified by faith, we have peace with God. 4. The least
measure of true Faith works this peace. Indeed according to the measure of our
Faith, so shall the measure of our peace be; but not only the strong Faith
(such as was in the Martyrs, and other extraordinary men) but the least measure
of Faith will work this sound peace in some measure: as the least Faith will
justify us, so will it work this peace in us also, Romans 5. 1. See therefore
how general terms are used in this case, Matthew. 7. 24. Whosoever hears my
word, and does it. And 1. John 5. 4, 5. Whatsoever is borne of God overcomes
the world; and this is the victory that ouercometh the world, even our faith.
Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the
Son of God? Now the faithful (that know, that the Lord is great in power,
and will not at all acquit the wicked, Nah. 1. 3. and that none can be saved,
that does not continue to the end, Matthew. 24. 13.) could never have this peace,
unless they were certain, not only that they are for the present in Gods
favor, but also that they shall so continue; according to that speech of
Christ, John 6. 35. I am the bread of life, he that comes to me shall never
hunger, and he that believes on me shall never thirst.

2. It works in them joy in the Holy Ghost: It works a sound, constant, and
unspeakable joy in the heart of every one that has it. Acts 8. 37. He went
his way rejoicing, 1. Pet. 1. 8. In whom now, though you see him not, yet do
you believe, and rejoice with joy unspeakable, and glorious. Yea it makes a
man able to rejoice, even in the greatest affliction, it made Paul and Silas
after they had been shamefully and grievously scourged, sing merrily even at
midnight, even in the dungeon, even in the stocks, Acts 16. 25. As we have
also seen in the example of the Martyrs: no threats, no torments could daunt
them, but they have expressed a marvelous joy, even in the midst of all their
tortures. What was the cause of it? The Apostle tells us, 1. John 5. 4. This is
the victory that overcomes the world, even our Faith. And though every one of
the faithful attain not to that measure of joy, as these; yet in every true
believer, Faith works this joy in some measure. It is the same Faith we have,
that they had, the like precious faith, (...). Pet. (...). 1. and the same
work it will have in every one, Being justified by faith we have peace with
God; and rejoice in hope of the glory of God; and not only so, but we glory in
tribulation also, Romans 5. 1, 2, 3. Now they could not thus rejoice, unless
they were certain, not only for the present, that they are in Gods favor,
but also (for the time to come) that they shall so continue: For otherwise it
were extreme folly in them thus to rejoice, as they that triumph before the
victory. And indeed the Papists do deride us for this Doctrine we teach of
confidence and glorying, and say to us as Ahab did to Benhadad, 1. King. 20.
11. Let not him that girdeth on his harness, boast himself, as he that
puts it off. It is a folly for men (say they) to be so confident, and to
glory thus, seeing we have not yet gotten the victory, but are in warfare; we
know not how far we may fall before we die. But to them we answer, as Esa^
40. 2. Our warfare is accomplished, the victory is already gotten, our iniquity
is pardoned; whatsoever we may fall into, we have (in our head) received at the
Lord bands double for our sins: and therefore we are so confident.

3. It makes a man able to go to God in prayer; 1. At all times, even in times
of greatest anguish of heart: as we shall see, Psalm. 88. When he had said,
verse 7. Thy wrath lies hard upon me, and thou have afflicted me with all thy
waves, yet even then, he prayed as he says, verse 9. Lord I have called daily
upon thee. 2. In all his occasions, Phil. 4. 6. In every thing let your
requests be made known unto God. 3. And that not for himself only, but for
others also, If any man see his brother sin, a sin which is not unto death, he
shall ask, and he shall give him life, for them that sin not unto death, 1.
John 5. 16. 4. And that with great assurance to speed, and prevail with God,
1. John 5. 14. This is the confidence we have in him, that if we ask any thing
according to his will, he hears us. Yea 5. with a marvelous confidence and
boldness. Ephesians. 3. 12. By him we have boldness, and entrance with confidence
by faith in him. It makes us able (as Etiphaz says, Job 22. 26.) to life up
our face to God, Heb. 4. 16. Let us go boldly unto the Throne of grace.
Therefore also we shall often observe in the Scriptures, a marvelous familiarity
between the faithful and God. Job 13. 24, 25. Wherefore hidest thou thy face,
and hold me for thine enemy, etc. Psalm. 13. 1. How long will thou forget me
(O Lord) for ever? How long will thou hide thy face from me, etc. Psalm. 89. 46,
47. How long, Lord, will thou hide thy face for ever? Shall thy wrath burn
like fire? Remember how short my time is: wherefore have thou made all men in
vain? Now the faithful (knowing that to be true of all wicked men, that live
in their sins, which Joshua speaks, Josh. ^4 1^. Ye cannot serve the Lord:
for he is an holy God, he is a jealous God, he will not forgive your
transgressions, nor your sins) durst never speak thus boldly and familiarly
unto God, if they were not certain of his favor, and of the forgiveness of
their sins; for that is the only ground of this boldness and familiarity
with God. Heb. 10. 22. Let us draw near with a true heart in assurance of
faith sprinkled in our hearts from an evil conscience.

4. The fourth is willingness, and desire to dye. Faith freeth the heart from
the fear of death, and makes a man willing, yea desirous to dye. This we shall
observe in sundry of the Martyrs, that when death has come to them in his most
ougly shape, they have not feared him, but insulted over him: and as Eliphaz
says, Job 5. 22. They have laughed at destruction. Thus Paul brings in the
faithful, defying, and insulting over death, 1. Cor. 15. 55. O death, where is
thy sting? O grave where is thy victory? verse 57. Thanks be unto God, which
has given us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Yea they have been so
far from fearing death, that they have embraced it when it came, and desired
it earnestly. This we shall see in Simeon: so soon as he had seen Christ, he
bursts out into this prayer unto God, Luke 2. 29. Now let thou thy servant
depart in peace according to thy Word. And Paul. Phil. 1. 23. I desire to be
dissolved, and to be with Christ, which is best of all. Yea he makes this the
disposition of all the faithful, 2. Cor. 5. (...). Therefore we sigh (as
those that bear a great burden, verse. 4.) desiring to be clothed with our
house which is from heaven. And indeed there is never a faithful man, but
(though he find in himself sometimes a fear of death, yet) before he goes
from hence, his Faith will free him from this fear, and make him willing and
desirous to dye, mark the perfect man and behold the upright: for the end of
that man is peace, Psalm. 37. 37. Now it were not possible the faithful should
thus be freed from the fear of death, should thus desire to die (seeing they
know, Heb. 2. 14. that Satan has the power of death, and Heb. 9. 27. After
death comes judgment) if they were not fully assured of their salvation: and
this reason the Apostle gives, 2. Cor. 5. 6. 8. therefore we are always
confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from
the Lord, we are confident I say, and willing rather to be absent from the
body, and to be present with the Lord.

Lecture the seventy four. December 4. 1610. JOHN IIII. XLII.
I Have already proved unto you, that by Faith a man may be assured, and
certainly persuaded of his salvation, both by the confession of the faithful,
and by the effects it works in the heart that has received it. Now let us us
come to the reasons, why they that have Faith, may be so certain, and assured
of their salvation, yea cannot but be certain of it.

And the first Reason is, because this persuasion is grounded upon the
testimony of Gods Word, that cannot deceive them, therefore there is certainty
Reas. 1.
in it. May not a man be fully assured of that, which he has Gods Word for?
There is no such certainty in the knowledge that is gotten by sense,
observation, experience, or any other way, as in that, that is grounded upon
Gods Word. ^sal. 93. 5. Thy testimonies are very sure, says David. Now the
true believer does not build his persuasion upon any deceivable fancy, but
upon Gods Word only: the Faith of the Elect is therefore called the Faith of
truth, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13. and the Word is called the Word of Faith, Rom 10. 8.
Therefore says David, speaking of the ground of his confidence, Psalm. ^0. 10.
I will rejoice in God because of his Word, in the Lord will I rejoice because
of his Word. And Psalm. 130. 5. I have waited on the Lord, my soul has waited,
and I have trusted in his Word. If a man cannot prove by Gods Word, that Christ
dyed for him, that his sins are forgiven, that he is one that shall be saved,
his persuasion of it is but a fancy, it is no Faith, he can have no assurance
or certainety of it, specially in the time of tentation. Sa^han will be beaten
back no way, but by this sword of the Spirit, Ephesians 6. 17. As Christ resisted
him (Matthew. 4. 4. 7. 10.) so must we. But if a man can prove by the Word, that
Christ dyed for him, that his sins are forgiven him, that he shall be saved;
then may he be fully assured indeed, then shall he have no cause to doubt of
it. Now God has given us his Word to assure us of this, and put us out of
doubt in this matter. The Apostle makes this the reason, why God made a new
Covenant with us, abolished the Covenant of works, and gave us the Covenant of
grace, and promised eternal life upon condition of Faith, and not of works;
that the promise might be sure to all the seed of Abraham, Romans 4. 16. Not
sure in respect of God (for so it was in the old Covenant) but sure to the
believers. And John says, 1. John 5. 13. These things have I written to you
that believe, that you may know you have eternal life. And 1. John 1. 4. These
things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. Why, but will you say, who
can bring any Word to prove that he shall be saved? I answer, that it is
written, that whosoever believes in Christ shall not perish, but have life
everlasting, John 3. 16. And verse 36, He that believes in the Son, has
everlasting life. And therefore he that can say, he is sure he does believe in
Christ (as every faithful man can) has Gods express Word to assure him, that
he shall be saved. Now a man that has Faith, may (by the fruits of it)
certainly know that he has it indeed. This is evident by 2. Corinthians 13.
5. Prove your selves whether ye are in the Faith, examine your selves, know
you not your own selves, how that Christ Jesus is in you, except ye be
reprobates?

The second Reason, why they that have Faith, may be so certain of their
salvation, is, because their Faith is grounded upon the testimony Reas. 2.
of Gods Spirit, that cannot deceive them. 1. John 2. 27. The anointing which
ye have received of him abides in you, and it is truth, and is no lie.

Now the Spirit of God is given to the faithful to assure them of their
salvation, the spirit it self bears witness with our spirit that we are the
children of God, Rom 8. 16. 1. John 3. 14. We know that we are passed from
death to life, because we love the brethren. He that has but that one grace,
may be sure of his salvation; how much more he that has many, and more
special graces of God? Therefore the Spirit of God is called a seal, and an
earnest-penny, 2. Cor. 1. 22. And well may it secure a man, because he that
knows he has it, may be sure he shall never lose it; it is an immortal seed,
1. Pet. 1. 23. it endures for ever, Psalm. 19. 9.

Object. No doubt, but he that has the Spirit of God to witness to his
conscience, that he is Gods child, may indeed be certain of it: but who can
be assured that he has the Spirit of God? How easy is it for a man to be
deceived in this, seeing 1. The heart is so deceitful, Ier. 17 9. 2 There be
many remnants of Gods Image in a natural man, that may seem to be the fruits
of the Spirit. And 3. There be many common gifts of the Spirit, which an
Hypocrite, and Reprobate may have?

Answ. I answer, i^ is true indeed: and therefore the faithful are often called
upon, to examine themselves, 1. Cor. 11. 28. and prove the good things that are
in them, Gal. 6. 4. But yet this I say, that he that has the Spirit of God,
may certainly and undoubtedly know, that he has it: and as the Spirit is
given us to witness to our spirits, that we are Gods children, so (like a good
witness) he speaks so evidently and plainly, that he that has him, may know
and discern his voice, and plainly understand what he says. Hezechia knew he
had walked before God in truth, and with a perfect heart, and had done that
which was good in his sight, Esaias 38. 3. and Peter knew well, that he loved
Christ unfeignedly above all things, John 21. 17. and Paul could say, he was
assured he had a good conscience in all things, Heb. 13. 18.

And least any should say, these were extraordinary men: may all that have the
Spirit be so certain they have it, as were these three? I will therefore show
you, that this is the case of all them that have Gods Spirit; not of some rare,
and extraordinary persons only. The Apostle speaks thus not in his own name
only, but in the name of all the faithful. 1. John. 5. 19. We know that we
are of God; that is, borne of God Yea, they that have received the Spirit, have
been so certain of the uprightness of their hearts, that no opposition of
men, or Satan, nor any affliction could drive them from it. For this we have a
notable example in Job, Job 27. 5, 6. God forbid that I should justify you;
until I dye, I will never take away mine innocence from my self, I will keep
^y righteousness, and will not forsake it, mine heart shall not reprove me
all my days.

3. The third Reason, why he that has Faith may be so certain of his
salvation, is, because the hope and assurance he has of his perseverance Reas.
3.
to the end, is grounded wholly upon God, not upon any thing that is in
himself. 1. Pet. (...). 2. Peter says of the faithful, that their faith and
hope is in God. The maine argument against the certainety of salvation, is the
uncertainty of perseverance. Now I have showed you in the proof of the
Doctrine, that the faithful may be certain of their perseverance unto the
end. Psalm. 1^ 8. 8. The Lord will p^rfect that which concerns me, Phil. 1. 6.
Being confident of this very thing, that h^e which has begun a good Work in
you, will perform it, until the day of Jesus Christ. Upon what ground (will
you say) is this certainety built? Surely not upon any thing that is in us (for
we are exceeding variable, and apt to fall, and when we had our salvation in
our own keeping, though we were then far stronger than now we are) we lost
it quickly. But now our state in Christ is in this respect better than it was
in Adam: we cannot now lose it, because it is not in our own keeping, our
assurance of perseverance is grounded wholly upon God. If we look upon our
selves, we see cause of fear and doubting; but if we look up to God, we shall
find cause enough of assurance, Psalm. 61. 2, 3. Lead me unto the Rock that
is higher than I: for thou have been a shelter for me, and a strong Tower. 2.
Tim. 2. 19. The foundation of God is sure. This Rock how sure it is, you shall
see in three points.

1. We are marvelous unconstant and fickle in our love to God, and good
things; we are apt quickly to turn out of the good way, Judge. 2. 19. but God
is constant and unchangeable in his love, I have loved thee with an everlasting
love, Ier. 31. 3. The decree and counsel of God is unchangeable, I am the
Lord, I change not, Mal. 3. 6. From hence the faithful man reasons thus: By
his spirit which I know he has given me, I am sure God elected, and loved me
in Christ, before all worlds: for he never bestowed justifying faith on any,
but on such, so many as were ordained unto eternal life believed, and none but
they, Acts 13. 48. therefore true faith, is called the faith of Gods Elect,
Tit. 1. 1. he never called any to the love and obedience of his truth, but
such, whom he did predestinate, them he also called, Romans 8 30. Therefore I am
sure, that how unconstant and unchangeable, how prone soever I am to fall; yet
I shall never fall finally: for he is constant, in him is no variableness,
neither shadow of changing, James 1. 17. His decree is immutable: it is not
possible, that any whom he has elected should perish, if it were possible,
they shall deceive the very elect, Matthew. 24. 24. his love that he has borne
to any in Christ, is unchangeable, having loved his own which were in the
world, he loved them to the end, John 13. 2. For, his love was free, not
occasioned by any goodness he foresaw would be in us; but the cause of it was
his own good pleasure only, Ephesians. 1. 5. At that time when he did perfectly
foresee how ignorant, weak, untoward, unconstant, ungracious we would be, yet
even then he set his love upon us: and what should then alter, or alienate his
affection from us? Therefore God speaks thus of his love to his Elect, Jeremy
31. 3. I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore in mercy have I
drawn thee. Esaias 54. 10. My kindness shall not depart from thee, says the
Lord, that has mercy on thee. Esaias 64. 5. In those is continuance, and we
shall be saved. When God has once drawn a man by his spirit to the faith and
obedience of his truth, he may then be sure he has loved him with an
everlasting and unchangeable love. Romans 11. 29. The gifts and calling of God
are without Repentance. Upon this David grounded his comfort and assurance,
Psalm 25. 6. Remember Lord thy tender mercies, and loving kindness, for they
have been for ever. And thus he stirs up all Gods people to do, Psalm 118.
2, 3, 4. Let Israel, and the house of Aaron, and they that fear the Lord now
say, that his mercy endures for ever.

2. We are weak and unable to resist the least tentation, much less those
mighty enemies that we have to encounter with; and therefore Christ bids us,
Mat. 26. 41. Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: We might (for
any strength that is in us) fall quite away from God every day. But the Lord
our God is strong, and of power sufficient, to keep that that is committed
unto him, 2. Tim. 1. 12. I suffer, and am not ashamed; for I know in whom I
have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that that I have
committed unto him, until that day. We are kept, says Peter, 1. Pet. 1. 5.
by the power of God through Faith unto Salvation. This reason our Savior gives
for the perseverance of the faithful, John 10. 28, 29. They shall never
perish, neither shall any pluck them out of mine hand: my Father which gave
them me is greater than all, and none is able to pluck them out of my Fathers
hand. This is that that keeps the Faithful from falling irrecouerably. Psalm.
37. 24. Though he fall, he shall not be cast off; for the Lord puts under
his hand.

3. We do enough every day to deserve that God should take his holy spirit from
us, and cast us off for ever. But, though we deserve no better, Christ has
deserved, that God should continue his grace and favor toward us unto the
end: and this is that, that is sealed and confirmed to us in the Lords Supper:
yea, he continually pleades this merit of his for us before his Father, and
makes intercession for us. The cause why Peter, though he fell fearfully, yet
could not fall totally nor finally, was that Prayer that Christ made for him,
Luke 22. 31, 32. Now look what prayer Christ made for Peter, he made for all
the faithful, as is plain, John 17. 20. neither pray I for these alone, but
for them also which shall believe on me, through their word. And this is a
chief part of that prayer he makes for them, verse 11. Holy Father, keep them
in thy Name, even them that thou have given me: and verse 15. I pray not, that
thou would take them out of the world, but that thou keep them from that
evil one: And that prayer was but the sum of that intercession, that he
makes for us continually, at the right hand of his Father, Heb. 7. 25. He is
able perfectly to save such as come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to
make intercession for them. And therefore (to conclude) seeing the Faithful
have such a rock to build their assurance upon, what marvel is it though they
be so fully assured, and undoubtedly persuaded of their salvation?

Lecture the seventy five. December 11. 1610. JOHN IIII. XLII.
IT follows now that we proceed to the Use that is to be made of the former
Doctrine: for it is certainly a Doctrine of great use. And in teaching you the
use of this Doctrine, I might first apply it to the confutation of the Papists,
who directly contradict this Doctrine, which has been so clearly and
evidently confirmed unto you by the holy Scriptures. But that I hold not to be
so needful or profitable in this place; specially, because in confuting the
error of the Papists in this point, I should but repeat what I have already
taught in the confirmation of the Doctrine. I will therefore make but three
Uses of this Doctrine: whereof the first shall be for Exhortation, the second
for Reproof, the third for Comfort.

First, if a man may in this life grow so certainly and undoubtedly assured
Use 1.
of Gods favor, and of his eternal salvation, we are all to be exhorted by
all means to seek for this certainetie. 1. Many think they have faith, that
yet are not, nor ever were certain of their salvation; have no assurance from
God what he means to do with them; what shall become of them after this
life; but go blundring on in an uncertain opinion, or wavering hope of Gods
favor, and rest in that, never seeking for any certainety. 2. Some that are
possessed with the spirit of bondage, and often vexed with terrible doubts and
fears about this matter; yet will never set their hearts to seek for this
certainety. 3. Some that have felt in themselves this comfortable assurance,
and now through their folly have lost it, yet seek not to recover it, as if it
were a matter of no worth. Well, we are, I say, to be exhorted to use all good
means, to be delivered from the spirit of bondage, and not to rest in an
uncertain opinion or wavering hope, but to seek to have this assurance; if we
have lost it, labor to recover it; if we have it, take heed we lose it not.
Cause not the light of his countenance to fall, as Job speaks of himself in
another case, Job 29. 24. Heb. 10. 35. Cast not away your confidence. This is
the exhortation of the Apostle, 2. Pet. 1. 10. Give diligence to make your
calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never be
moved. As if he should say, This certainety may be attained unto, if ye be
diligent. If we hold any land, or lease, we will spare no pains nor cost, to
make it as sure as we can, specially if we have ever an adversary that contends
with us about it: how much more does it stand us upon, to make this certain?
This is a matter we can never make too sure. Paul prays for all the
faithful, Col. 2. 2. That their hearts may be comforted in all riches of the
full assurance of understanding. And Verse 7. That they may be rooted and
built in Christ, and stablished in the Faith, abounding therein with
thanksgiving. And for the Ephesians he prays, Ephesians. 3. 17, 18, 19. That
being rooted, and grounded in (the assurance of Gods) love, they might be able
to comprehend with all Saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and
height, and to know the love of Christ which passes all knowledge, that they
might be filled with all fullness of God.

Me thinks, I should not need to use reasons to persuade, and move you to
seek for this assurance; yet, because we have all so great need to be stirred
vpto this duty, I will give you a few. First, it would free the heart from all
slavish fear that vexes and disquieteth it, and work a marvelous
quietness, and holy security in it. Psalm 46. 1, 2, 3. God is our hope and
strength, therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved, though the
mountains fall into the midst of the sea, etc. Romans 8. 31. If God be on our
side who can be against us? And without this we can have no true quietness of
mind, specially, in the time of extreme danger. Secondly, it would make our
hearts maruellously comfortable, and cheerful in every estate, 1. Pet. 1. 8.
You believe, and rejoice with joy unspeakable. In prosperity it would give a
sweet relish to all Gods blessings, Ioh. 29. 3. -- 7. Job, speaking of the
comfort he took in all Gods blessings, in the time of his prosperity, in the
recreations and delights of his youth, in his house, in his children, in his
riches, in the honor that God gave him; he alleges this for the reason of
it, Verse. 3. His light shined upon my head. Yea even in affliction it would
make us comfortable, Romans 5. 3. Neither do we so only, but we rejoice in
tribulations: and without this we can have no true joy, but either, 2. Cor. 5.
12. rejoice in the face not in the heart, or for a very short moment; our joy
will be, as Eccles. 7. 8. like the noise of thorns under the pot, so is the
laughter of fools. Thirdly, it would make us able to go to God in prayer, at
all times with boldness and delight, Job 23. 26. Thou shall then delight in
the Almighty, and lift up thy face unto God. But on the contrary, he that wants
this assurance, can take no comfort or delight in prayer, will he delight
himself in the Almighty, will he always call upon God? Job 27. 10. Fourthly,
to conclude, we have no true Faith, unless we strive for this assurance: and
what have we to yield us comfort in life or death, if we be without Faith?
Without faith it is impossible to please God, Heb. 11. 6. Now though a man may
have a true Faith, and yet so weak, that he may want this assurance for a
time, or have it in great weakness; yet without a mourning for, and striving
against our doubtings, without a seeking for this certainety, there can be no
true Faith in us, the poor man whose child was possessed, had much unbelief
and doubting in him, but he wept for it and cried to Christ for help against
it, Mar. 9. 24. For Gods Spirit wheresoever it is, lusts against the flesh,
Gal. 5. 17. That makes the Apostle say, Heb. 3. 6. His house we are, if we hold
fast our confidence, and the rejoicing of our hope unto the end. Now if we
desire to attain to this certain assurance of Gods favor, and of our
salvation; to keep it when we have it, to recover it when we have lost it; I
will show you some of the principal means, whereby this may be obtained.

The first is, to esteem highly of it, and account it our chief treasure and
happiness; for then our heart will be ever upon it, then we will look to it,
and be afraid to lose it, where your treasure is, there will your heart be
also, Matthew. 6. 21. the wise Merchant when he had found the treasure and
resolved to purchase it by parting with all that he had, did hide it so, that
he might not lose it, Matthew. 13. 44. The chief cause why many have so little
assurance of their salvation, is, for that they make no reckoning of it; there
be a thousand things they regard more than it. David made another manner of
reckoning of it, Psalm. 4. 6. Many say who will show us any good, but Lord lift
up the light of thy countenance upon us. As if he should say, Let me see it,
and be assured of it; that will suffice me. And 63. 3. Thy loving kindness is
better than life. And 80. 7. Cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.

The second means is, to use diligently and conscionably the exercises 2.
of Religion, and parts of Gods worship: for they are all ordained of God, to
work this assurance in our hearts. First, the reading of the Word, 1. John 1.
4. These things write we unto you, that your joy may be fu^l. Secondly, the
hearing of the Word, Luke 1. 77. The ministry of the Word is ordained of God,
to give knowledge of salvation to his people for the remission of their sins.
Thirdly, the receiving of the Sacrament; for every Sacrament is ordained to be
a seal of the righteousness of Faith, Romans 4. 11. Fourthly, Prayer, John 16.
24. Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full: And this may be
said generally of all the exercises of Religion. Therefore David gives this for
one reason, why he did so desire to dwell in Gods house, that he might behold
the beauty of the Lord, Psalm. 27. 4. A chief cause why many want this
assurance, is, for that they use not these parts of Gods worship constantly and
conscionably.

The third means is, to keep a good conscience carefully. Pro. 15. 15. A good
conscience is a continual feast. Peace and confidence is often ascribed 3.
to the practice of piety, Matthew. 7. 24. He that hears of me these words,
and does the same, is like to him that builds on a rock. Experience and
practice of godliness, are chief means to work this full assurance, 1. Tim.
6. 18, 19. Charge them that are rich, that they do good, laying up in store
for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay
hold on eternal life. 2. Pet. 1. 5. Join virtue with faith, and with virtue
knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, love. Then
follows, verse 10. Give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for
if you do these things, ye shall never fall. And verse 11. For by this means,
an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly, into the everlasting
Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. On the other side, the chief
cause why many can never grow to any assurance, and many having had it, have
lost it, is the neglect of a good conscience, their falling into sins against
their conscience. Me thinks, this should have great force to restrain men
from sin: see what ado Gods dear servants have had, to recover their
certainty and comfort, when they have fallen into foul sins, Psalm. 51. 8.
Make me to hear joy and gladness. Verse 11. Cast me not away from thy
presence. Verse 12. Restore me to the joy of thy salvation.

The fourth means is to observe our own ways diligently: and when we have
slipped into any sin, to humble our selves speedily before God, in the sense
and acknowledgement of it, and to seek peace with him. This is a sure way to
preserve our assurance. Job 13. 15. Though he slay me, I will put my trust in
him, and I will reprove my ways in his sight. Psalm. 32. 5. Then I acknowledged
my sins unto thee, neither did I hide mine iniquity: for I thought, I will
confess against my self my wickedness unto the Lord, and thou forgauest the
punishment of my sin. And this all Gods children have often found by
experience, that they never had a more sweet sense and assurance of Gods love,
than when they most deeply humbled themselves before him; in the free
acknowledging and bewailing of their sins. When they have sowed most tears
(this way) they have reaped most joy, Psalm. 126. 5. When they have been most
ready to accuse themselves, the Lord has been most ready to justify them, as
we see in the example of that Publican, Luke 18. 14. When they have cast
themselves lowest, the Lord has lifted them up highest this way, Humble your
selves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up, Iam. 4. 10. The more
humble and poor we are, the fitter we are to trust in God, I will leave in the
midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name
of the Lord, Zeph. 3. 12.

The last means to maintain this comfortable assurance of our salvation, is
to make continual observation of the experiments of Gods favor 5.
we daily receive, and of the undoubted fruits of Gods grace we find in our
selves: for experience breeds hope, Romans 5. 4. So says David, Psalm. 71. 5, 6.
Thou art my hope, O Lord God, thou art my trust from my youth, my praise shall
be always of thee. 2. Cor. 1. 10. Who delivered us from so great a death, and
does deliver us, in whom we trust, that hereafter he will deliver us. And for
observing the fruits of Gods grace in our selves, see what stead it stood Job
in, Chap. 29. and 30. and Gal. 6. 4. Let every man prove his own work, and
then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. And thus
much for the first Use.

Lecture the seventy six. December 18. 1610. JOHN IIII. XLII.
THe second Use of this Doctrine, is for the examination and trial of that
confidence and assurance we seem to have of Gods favor, and Use 2.
of our own salvation. For it is certain, that many a man has had a false
peace and persuasion of Gods favor, and of his own salvation. 1. Cor. 10. 12.
A man may think he stands that does not. To most wicked men God says, Ier. 3.
4. Did thou not still cry unto me, Thou art my father, and the guide of my
youth? Micah 3. 11. Yet they will lean upon God, and say, Is not the Lord
among us, no evil can come to us? Yea, they count them beasts that make any
doubt of this, they wonder to see Gods children so full of doubts and fears;
and conclude from thence, That either they have been notable hypocrites, and
more notorious sinners than other men, or else that they are mad and
frantic: And for one that Satan has overthrown by desperation, there are
twenty whom he has overthrown with this false assurance. We are therefore to
be exhorted to examine our assurance. Pro. 8. 26. He that trusts in his own
heart, is a fool. For, as the true assurance of Gods favor, is a comfortable
thing; so is a false peace and assurance one of the most grievous judgments
that can befall a man. Esaias 29. 9, 10. When he had said, Stay your selves and
wonder; he adds this to be the judgment they should wonder at: The Lord has
covered you with a spirit of slumber, and has shut up your eyes. Of the two,
it were better for a man to be vexed with continual doubts and fears, than to
be lulled asleep with such an assurance. For, besides that it keeps a man
from seeking to God, it will not hold, but fail him, when he shall have most
need of it. Job 11. 20. Their refuge shall perish, and their hope shall be
sorrow of mind. As the Apostle says of true confidence, Heb. 10. 35. Cast not
away your confidence, which has great recompense of reward. So may I say on
the contrary side to wicked men, Cast away this your confidence, for it shall
have no recompense of reward.

I will therefore give you some notes, whereby you may try whether the
assurance you have of Gods favor, and the peace you find in your selves, be
from faith or from presumption.

1. From the time when first we came unto this assurance. They that have this
false assurance, have had it from their Mothers womb, they were never of other
mind, they were never troubled with any fears or doubts this way: But the
faithful can say, there was a time when they had the spirit of bondage in
themselves, which wrought much fear, and after that had soundly humbled them,
then they came to this comfortable assurance. This is the ordinary way, ye
have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received
the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father, Romans 8. 15.

2. From the means whereby it was wrought in us. For, the assurance that the
faithful have, was first wrought in them by the Ministry of the Word, and is
thereby daily increased, I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace, Esaias 57.
19. They that have this false assurance, never found comfort in the Word, never
cared for it, nay, if any thing ever interrupt their peace, it is that; the
seldomer they hear it, the more quiet they are in their mind, Apoc. 11. 10.
These two Prophets vexed them that dwelt on the earth.

3. From the grounds whereupon our assurance is founded and built. For, their
assurance that have this false peace, is grounded, 1. Either upon Gods
temporal blessings, Hos. 12. 8. I am become rich, I have found me out
substance: in all my labors they shall find none iniquity in me, that were
sin. Or 2. Upon a general persuasion of Gods goodness, and Christ's merits,
Jeremy 3. 5. Will he keep his anger for ever? Will he reserve it to the end?
Matthew. 7. 2^. Not every one that says, Lord, Lord. Or 3. Upon some civil
virtues that they discern in themselves, which many other do want, as that
proud Pharisee did, God I thank thee that I am not as other men are,
extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this Publican, Luke 18. 11.
Whereas the faithful (as you have heard in the Doctrine) ground their
assurance upon Gods Word, upon the Testimony of Gods Spirit, upon the
Unchangeableness of Gods Love, and All Sufficiency that is in him, to keep
that that is committed to him.

4. From the measure of this assurance. For, the faithful have not this
assurance so perfect, but they are often troubled with doubts and fears. Gal. 9.
17. The flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and
these are contrary one to another. They find cause to cry, as Mark 9. 24.
Lord, I believe, help mine unbelief. But they that have this false assurance
are most confident, and never have any doubts. Luke 11. 21. When the strong man
armed keeps his palace, the things that he possesses are in peace.

5. The fifth and last difference, is from the effects and fruits of this
assurance. For in the natural man, his assurance of Gods favor works no
change at all in his life, makes him never the better: He has no more fear to
offend God because of this, no more care to please him: He can commit very
heinous sins, and never be troubled with them, they never interrupt the peace
of his conscience. Psalm. 64. 4. They shoot in secret at the perfect, suddenly
do they shoot at him, and fear not. Yea, his very assurance that he pretends
he has of Gods favor, emboldneth him to sin. Jeremy 3. 4, 5. Did thou not
still cry to me, Thou art my Father, etc. but thou do evil even more and
more. They are wicked: therefore can they have no true peace, there is no peace
says my God to the wicked, Esaias 57. 21. But on the other side, the true
assurance that Gods Spirit works in the faithful, makes them careful to
please God, fearful to offend him. Psalm 26. 3. Thy loving kindness is
before mine eyes: therefore have I walked in thy truth. Psalm. 119. 166. Lord, I
have trusted in thy salvation, and have done all'thy comman. dements. 1. John
3. 3. Every one that has this hope in him purges himself, even as he is
pure. And indeed none can have any true trust in God, but such as fear him,
Psalm 115. 11. Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord. For God uses not
to speak peace to any, but to his Saints, and such, as he does withal by his
grace restrain that they turn not again unto folly, Ps. 85. 8.

The third Use of the former Doctrine, is for the comfort of such as do
unfeignedly fear God, and have sometimes had an undoubted assurance Use 3.
of their salvation, and have now lost the feeling of it. This has been the
case of many of Gods servants, and may be the case of every one of us. You know
the Church complains of this, I sought him whom my soul loves, I sought him
but I found him not, Cant. 3. 1. And how often does David complain, That his
soul cleaued to the dust, Psalm. 119. 25. That is melted for heaviness, verse
28. That his spirit was in perplexity, and his heart within was amazed, Psalm.
143. 4. Lord, why do thou reject my soul, and hidest thy face from me,
Psalm. 88. 14. He said in his haste he was cast out of Gods sight, Psalm. 31.
22. Yea secondly, sometimes he continued in this estate a great while together.
Psalm. 13. 1. How long will thou forget me, O Lord? how long will thou hide face
from me? Psalm. 119. 82. Mine eyes fail for thy promise, saying, When will thou
comfort me? And thirdly, he had these fits oftentimes also, Psalm 88. 16. From
my youth I suffer thy terrors. Seeing therefore the dearest of Gods children
do often lose this comfortable assurance, and when they have lost it, are so apt
to conclude against themselves, that they were never in the state of grace,
they never had true faith; I will therefore give you five Rules for the comfort
of such as are thus distressed.

1. The first is to search out the special sin that has deprived thee of
this comfort, and repent of it. This Rule is prescribed, why is living man
sorrowful? Let us search and try our ways, and turn again unto the Lord,
Lam. 3. 39, 40. Thus did David recover his comfort, when I kept silence, my
bones waxed old, through my roaring all the day long, and I acknowledged my sin
unto thee, etc. and thou forgauest the iniquity of my sin, Psalm 32. 3, 4. 5.

2. To call to mind the grace that in former times thou have felt in thy
self, whatfaith, and feeling, and comfort in prayer; what care of a good
conscience thou art sure thou have had in thee heretofore: for from thence thou
may boldly conclude, That there is grace in thee still, though thou can
not now feel it, the gifts and calling of God are without repentance, Romans 11.
29. This rule David followed, when he had lost his feeling of Gods favor and
grace. Psalm. 77. 5, 6. Then I considered the days of old, and the years of
ancient time: I called to my remembrance my songs in the night. And 143. 5. Yet
do I remember the time past.

3. To search thine own heart diligently, and thou shall observe (even when
thou art at the worst) certain notes of grace in thee. Now there is no
Christian, but when he is at the worst, and has least feeling of his Faith,
and of the certainety of his salvation, but if he would look into himself, he
should find these graces in himself: 1. That he yields not to his
infidelity, but strives against it, and grieves unfeignedly that he has lost
the assurance of Gods favor. Psalm 77. 2. His soul refused comfort. Uerse 3.
His spirit was full of anguish. Verse 10. And I said, this is my death. 2. That
he desires above all things, and seeks unfeignedly and earnestly to recover his
feeling of Gods favor again. Cant. 3. 1, 2, 3. The Spouse sought her Beloved
in her bed, verse 1. about in the City by the streets, and by the open places,
verse 2. enquired of the Watchmen for her Beloved, verse 3. So says David of
himself, when his spirit was in perplexity within him, Psalm 143. 6. I
stretched forth mine hands unto thee, my soul desires after thee, as the
thirsty Land. 3. That though he have no feeling of Gods love to him, yet he
loves God, and desires to please, and honor him, is afraid to do any thing
that might offend him. Psalm 44. 18, 19. Our heart is not turned back,
neither have our steps declined from thy way, though thou have smitten us down
to the place of Dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death. Now if any
one of these graces be in thee, thou may be sure thou art alive. As if we
discern in one that (by many likelihoods) seems to be dead, that he either
breaths, or moves, or hears, we are sure there is life in him: So is it in
this case. And every Christian is bound (in the affliction of his conscience)
to take notice of that grace that is in him, as well as of that corruption that
is in him, that he may be as well thankful to God for the one, as he is
humbled for the other. 1 Thessalonians, 5. 18. In all things give thanks: for this is
the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you. This rule David followed, Psalm
77. 6. I communed with mine own heart, and my spirit searched diligently.

4. Use the benefit of their advice, that can better judge of thine estate,
than thou thy self, for the present, can. This rule the Apostle prescribes,
Is any sick among you? Let him send for the Elders of the Church, and let them
pray over him. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall
raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be sorgiuen him.
Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, James 5. 14, 15,
16. and this course the Church took, when by her secret and private endeauours
in her bed by night, she could not find her beloved, she went out into the
streets of the City among her godly acquaintance for their help; and when that
would not serve, she sought help of the watchmen and Ministers of the Church,
Cant. 3. 2, 3.

5. Lastly, rest assured, that though thou have for the present lost it, yet
thou shall, before thou go hence, recover thy assurance and comfort again.
See this in that prayer of David, grounded (doubtless) upon Gods promise,
Psalm 39. 13. Stay thine anger from me, that I may recover my strength before
I go hence, and be not. Yea, be thou sure it will return with advantage, as
the seed that is cast into the ground uses to do. Psalm 97. 11. Light is
sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart.

Having now finished this Doctrine, which we have learned from the second part
of the Text, viz. the certainety that was in the Faith of these Samaritans; it
follows now, that we proceed unto the third, viz. the means whereby they
were brought to this certainety, the ground whereupon they did build their
Faith; and that they say, was not the saying of the Woman, but the hearing of
him themselves. And from hence we have this Doctrine to learn:

That the Faith and Religion of Gods Elect, is not grounded upon the testimony
of any man, but upon Gods own Word only. The judgment that others, whom we
reverence and respect, have of Religion, and the testimony that they give unto
it, causes us at the first to have a good opinion of it: the State, learned
men, parents, and friends, specially the good example of those that profess
it, have great force thus far: thus the Apostle says, that they that obey
not the Word may without the word be won by the conversation of their wives, 1.
Pet. 3. 1. And we are to hold it a great mercy of God, that we were borne, and
brought up not among Papists, or Infidels, but in the Church of God, where his
true Religion was professed, and where we might enjoy these helps, so the
Apostle says, that men shall glorify God in the day of their visitation, that
they lived among such as by whose godly and honest conversation, they were won
to a liking of the true Religion which they did profess, 1. Pet. 2. 12. But
yet all this will not bring us to Faith, or certainty in our Religion, till we
hear God himself speak, and give testimony to it in his holy Word. John
Baptist gave testimony to Christ: and because the Jews had a reverent opinion
of John, they also (for a while) conceived highly of Christ; and yet they could
not certainly believe he was the Messiah. Why? Because they could not hear
God himself speak, and give testimony to it in his holy Word: ye sent unto
John and he bore witness of me, etc. and the works that I do bear witness
of me; and the father himself has borne witness of me; ye have neither
heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape; And ye have not his word
abiding in you: search the Scriptures, etc. John 5. 33, 35, 37, 38, 39.

2. The Ministry of the Word, brings us not only to a good opinion of
Religion, and to an outward profession of it, but works Faith and Certainety
in our consciences, Faith comes by hearing, Romans 10. 17. But the means
whereby it works this Faith and Certainety in us, is the Word it self, by
causing us to see the ground of that it teaches us to believe in the Word:
therefore Paul says, Acts 26. 22. Having obtained help of God, I continue
unto this day, witnessing both to small and great: saying none other things,
than those things which the Prophets and Moses did say should come. When once
we hear God in his Word to teach us any truth, then are we certain of it, and
not before. Acts 17. 11, 12. Therefore many of them believed. Then we believe
no longer, because men teach us, but for that we are taught of God himself:
and though they that did first teach us, and draw us to a liking of the truth,
should fall from it, yet will not we forsake it, when once we can say we
have heard him our selves.

The Reason of the Doctrine is, that all men are subject to error; and Reason.
therefore their testimony is too weak a foundation to ground our Faith upon:
and on the other side, there is no possibility of error in Gods Word: every
man is a lier, that is, subject to be deceived himself and so to deceive
others, Romans 3. 4. Psalm 93. 5. Thy testimonies are very sure.

To show the difference between our Religion, and that of the Papists, Use 1.
and whether has most certainety. The Papist grounds his Faith upon the
testimony of the Church, I will not say of what Church: but say it were the
true Church of Christ, yet it consists only of men that are subject to
error; and consequently, the conscience cannot with any certainety rely upon
the testimony thereof. But we ground our Faith only upon the Word of God.

Object. 1. How can we know the Scripture to be the Word, but by the testimony
of the Church?

Answ. Indeed, the testimony of the Church does first incline us to think,
that the Scripture is the Word of God, and makes us willing to hear and read
it: but after we, by hearing and reading it, attain to further certainety and
assurance: for God himself speaks to us in the Scriptures, he spoke by the
mouth of his holy Prophets which have been since the world began, Luke 1. 70.
God at sundry times, and in diverse manners spoke in times past unto the fathers
by the Prophets, Heb. 1. 1. and that so clearly and evidently, that the
faithful are undoubtedly assured, it is he that speaks, it is indeed his
Word. And they can say, as Cant. 2. 8. It is the ^oice of my Belou^d. And 5. 2.
It is the voice of my B^loued that knocks. This is promised to the faithful,
Esaias 52. 6. They shall know in that day, that I am he that does speak, behold
it is I. John 7. 17. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the
Doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of my self. And indeed, if
we could not now be undoubtedly certain, that it is indeed Gods Word, the
case of the Church were worse now, than it was when God spoke to his people in
visions and dreams; for they were (without any external testimony from men)
fully assured then, that it was the Lord himself indeed that spoke unto them,
if Abraham had not been so, he would not have been so forward to sacrifice
his Son, Genesis 22. 3. nor Cornelius in obeying the commandment he had
received in a vision to send for Peter, Acts 10. 7. After Paul had seen the
vision, immediately he endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering
that the Lord called him to preach the Gospel unto them, Acts 16. 10. No it is
certain, that we may be more sure that God speaks to us in his Word, than
they could be of his speaking unto them in visions, 2. Peter 1. 19. We have
also a more sure word of prophecy.

Obi^ct. 2. The Scriptures are obscure, and no man can be certain of the sense
of them, but by the Church.

Answ. 1. To the natural man indeed they are obscure, the natural man
receives not the things of the spirit of God, 1. Cor. 2. 14. 2. But in
themselves they are plain and clear to them, whose eyes God has opened, the
entrance into thy Word gives light, it gives understanding unto the simple,
Psalm. 119. 130. 3. God has promised to teach all his Elect, and to give them
his Spirit to open their minds, that they may understand the Scriptures in
those points, the knowledge whereof is necessary to their salvation, they shall
be all taught of God, Ioh. 6. 45.

Seeing all are bound to seek for certainety in the matters of their Religion,
Use 2.
we are all to be Exhorted: First, That we would in these matters not rest upon
the credit of any man, but seek to ground our consciences upon the Word of
God; else will we be found in the day of tentation, no better than the foolish
man that built upon the sand, Matthew. 7. 26. Secondly, That we would labor to
bring good and honest hearts to the reading and hearing of the Word, because to
such only the promise is made, that God by his Spirit will instruct them, What
man is he that fears the Lord? him shall he teach in the way that he shall
choose, Psalm 25. 12.

Follows now the fruit and effect, whereby they testified their Faith; Viz.
the open profession they make of it to the Woman, that first drew them to
Christ: which teaches us this Doctrine:

That he that has true Faith, will be ready to make profession of it, when
occasion shall be offered, with the heart man belieueth unto righteousness
Doct.
and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation, Romans 10. 10. We having
the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed and therefore
have I spoken, we also believe, and therefore speak, 2. Cor. 4. 13.

God sets up the light of his grace in no man's heart, for his own private use
only, but that it might give light unto others, men light not a candle, and
Reason.
put it under a bushel but on a candlestick, and it gives light even to all
that are in the house, Matthew. 5. 15.

1. To reprove the Nicodemites of our time, such as pretend to have Faith, and
to have received the love of Gods truth; and yet are ashamed, Use.
or afraid to make profession of it among such, as will hate or scorn them
for it: such I would wish to meditate of these two places, Job 6. 10. Then
should I yet have comfort, yea, I would harden my self in sorrow, let him not
spare: for I have not concealed the words of the holy One. And Matthew. 10. 32,
33. Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my
Father which is in Heaven: but whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I
also deny before my Father which is in Heaven.

2. To reprove the Hypocrites, who will pretend to have grace: and yet no man
of judgment that conuerseth with them, is able to discern it, either in their
words or deeds. One principal way, whereby we are to make profession of our
Religion, is a holy life, Let your light so shine before men, that they may see
your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven, Matthew. 5. 16. A
verbal profession without this, is little worth.

THE SEVENTIE SEVEN LECTVRE, ON IANVARY XV. MDCX.
IOH. IIII. XLIII, XLIIII, XLV. Now after two days, he departed thence, and
went into Galile.

For Jesus himself testified, that a Prophet has no honor in his own
Country.

Then when he was come into Galile, the Galileans received him; having seen
all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the Feast: for they also went unto
the Feast.


THe last day we finished the History of that speech, that our Savior had with
the woman of Samaria; and of the great good that came of it, both unto her
self, and unto her neighbors: it follows now, that we proceed unto the
History of his going into Galile, the place which it pleased him to make choice
of, for the exercise of the greatest part of his Ministry, and to spend most of
his time in. This History was begun in the three first verses of this Chapter,
and has been hitherto interrupted and discontinued, by a long relation of
that which fell out in the way. These three Verses which I have now read, do
summarily set down our Saviors return into Galile. But before we come to the
division of the Text, and the handling of the several parts of it, one doubt
and difficulty is to be removed, to make our way plain unto the Doctrine that
is to be delivered from it. For it may be demanded, whether Galile were not his
own Country, and (if it were) what sense is there in Quest.
this reason, He went into Galile, because a Prophet has no honor in his own
Country?

To this I answer, that though Christ were brought up in the Province Answ.
and Country of Galile (for Nazaret was a city in Galile, Mark 1. 9. in which
respect also, he was sometimes called Jesus the Galilean, Matthew. 26. 69.) yet
in this place, by his own Country, is meant Nazaret (as it is also called,
Matthew. 13. 54. Luke 4. 23.) because, though he was not borne there, but at
Bethlehem in Judah; yet Nazaret was the town where his parents had dwelt, Luke
2. 39. and wherein he was brought up, and had lived by the space of thirty
years, Luke 4. 16. In which respect also, the Jews were wont to call him
Jesus of Nazaret, Matthew. 21. 11. Luke 24. 19. Yea, it was necessary he should
be brought up there, because of that Prophecy that had been made of him.
Matthew. 2. 23. He came and dwelt in a City called Nazaret, that it might be
fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophets, He shall be called a Nazaren. So
that the words that I have now read, are as if the Evangelist should have said
in plain terms, thus, After two days he departed thence, and went (not to
Nazaret, for he shund that town of purpose, but) into other parts of Galile:
for he knew that in Nazaret, his own Country, he should have no honor, his
Ministry would not be regarded at all. So that in these Verses that I have now
read, there be four principal points to be observed: First, our Saviors
leaving and shunning of Nazaret, his own Country, and going into other parts
of Galile. Secondly, the reason why he did so, because he knew he could have no
honor there. Thirdly, the good entertainment that he found in those parts of
Galile, that he went unto; When he was come into Galile, the Galileans
received him. Fourthly, the cause of that good entertainment he found among
them, They had seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the Feast: for
they also went unto the Feast.

For the first, it is a thing worthy of our observation, that our Savior
(being now to begin to preach (for till after this time, he had seldom or
never preached, as is plain by that we find, from that time (after this his
coming into Galile) Jesus began to preach, Matthew. 4. 17.) and making choice of
Galile, rather than of Jerusalem, or all Judea, to exercise his Ministry, and
spend most of his time and labor in) passes by Nazaret, and refuses to make
choice of that place to preach or live in. Yea, it is twice recorded that he
passed by Nazaret; here in this place when he went to Cana, and again, Matthew.
4. 13. when he went to Capernaum. We read indeed, that once he preached at
Nazaret, Luke 4. 16. but it was but once, he made no abode there; and that one
Sermon was made not so much in mercy, as in judgment, to make them without
excuse: as appears by the answer he makes to a secret objection they might
make against him, Luke 4. 25 -- 27. Which was (in effect) as if he should have
said unto them, I am not sent to you, God has forbidden me to preach unto you.

Secondly, But why did he thus leave and shun Nazaret, his own Country,
which he did (doubtless) owe more duty unto, than to any other place? For it
is certain, every man owes a duty to the place of his birth, and specially of
his education and dwelling, in respect of the many blessings of God he has
received there: therefore also every City and Town in Israel, was called a
mother in Israel, 2. Sam. 20. 19. In respect hereof, the light of nature has
taught men, that every man's Country may challenge some right and interest, in
whatsoever gifts or abilities God has given unto him. See what an affection
the Apostle expresses toward his Countrymen, he calls God to witness, that
he had great heaviness and continual sorrow in his heart to see their
blindness and obstinacy, Rom 9. 12. his hearts desire and prayer to God for
them was that they might be saved, Romans 10. 1. And (doubtless) Christ loved
his own Country, as dearly as ever any good man did, and more too. All good
affections were in him, in far greater perfection, than in any of us. What
was then the cause, why he showed so little respect now unto his own Country?
Was it the baseness and obscurity of that place? No verily: For (for ought we
can read in the Scripture, or any other Author) it was every whit as populous,
and of as good note, as either Cana, or Capernaum, or Corazin, or Bethsaida.
Yea, it had this honor above all the Cities either in Galile or Judea, that he
had dwelt so long there, and bore his name (in part) from that place. Was it
then for any notorious wickedness, that did abound in that town, more than in
any other town in Galile? Surely, ^o such thing is recorded of it: but (for
ought we can read) it was as civil a place as any other that Christ conuersed
most in. True it is, that on a time after he had preached there, they thrust
him out of their City, and would have thrown him down headlong from the top
of an hill, Luke 4. 29. but that was long after this time, as will appear, if
we well observe what is written, whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum,
do also here in thy country, Luke 4. 23. he had done many miracles in
Capernaum before that time. The only true cause why he passed by Nazaret, and
refused to exercise his Ministry there, was because he knew he could have no
honor there, as it is plainly said here, verse 44. He himself (without the
disswasion of any) had testified (that is, with great earnestness and
compassion affirmed to his Disciples, as they had had speech of that matter in
the journey) that neither he nor any other Prophet, could have any honor in
his own Country.

Now these two points being thus observed in the Text, the Doctrine that
arises from hence for our instruction is this:

That there is an honor due unto every true Prophet and Minister of God; and
the Lord holds all such unworthy of the comfort of his Gospel, as will Doct. 1.
not honor his Prophets. There be two branches (as you see) of the Doctrine,
and we will confirm them distinctly and severally.

1. That it is the will of God, that his people should honor his Prophets and
Ministers. See the proof for this out of the Old Testament, Judges 13. 17.
Manoah asks the Angel, that brought him word of the birth of Sampson, whom
he took to be a Prophet and Messenger of the Lord, what his name was: and
gives this for the reason; that when his sayings were come to pass (and so
they should prove that he was a true Prophet indeed) they might honor him.
And Lam. 4. 16. it is noted for a foul sin, and sign of marvelous
confusion, that they reverenced not the face of the Priests. Plain places also
there be for this in the New Testament, 1. Tim. 5. 17. Let the Elders that rule
well, be counted worthy of double honor, especially they that labor in the
Word and Doctrine. So no man takes this honor unto himself, but he that is
called of God, Heb. 5. 4. hold such in reputation, Phil. 2. 29.

2. The second branch of the Doctrine is also evident. The Lord holds all
such unworthy of the comfort of his Gospel, that will not esteem of, nor
honor his Prophets. For this point also, I will bring you two plain places
out of the Old Testament, and two out of the New. When the causes are laid
down, 2. Chron. 36. for which God deprived the Jews of his Word and Worship,
this is reckoned for the chief, verse 16. They mocked the Messengers of the
Lord, and misused his Prophets. And Hosea 4. 4. the Lord threatening this
fearful judgment to the Jews, that they should have none to rebuke or
reprove them for their sins, he gives this for the reason of it: For this
people are as they that rebuke the Priest. Two plain places also there are in
the New Testament for this. Matthew. 21. 43. when our Savior prophesies that
the Kingdom of God should be taken from the Jews, he gives this for the
chief reason of it (which had been mentioned by him in a Parable in the
former Verses, specially verse 35. viz.) the indignities they had offered to
Gods Prophets and Messengers. And Matthew. 23. 39. when he had threatened them of
Jerusalem, that (whereas he had often preached unto them, and sought their
conversion in as loving and careful a manner, as the Hen gathers her
Chickens under her wings) now he would leave them, and they should see him no
more till the day of judgment, he alleges no particular sin for the cause
of this, but the dishonor and contempt they showed unto the Prophets, verse 37.

Before I come to the Reasons of this Doctrine, let me entreat you to observe
with me, what account the Lord makes of the honor of his Prophets, and how
highly he is displeased with the dishonours and indignities that have been
done to his Ministers, in the example of four Kings of Judah: which in the
beginning of their reign had been worthy and excellent Princes, and never
prospered after they had done contempt and dishonor to Gods Prophets. The
first of these was Asa, 2. Chron. 16. Hanani the Prophet came to him, and
delivered faithfully a message from the Lord, and it is said, verse 10. Asa was
wroth with the Seer, and put him into prison: But look what followed to the
end of verse 12. and you shall see, he never prospered after. The next of these
Kings was Ioash, 2. Chron. 24. Zachary the Prophet (the son of Iehoiadah the
Kings Cousin-Germane) delivers faithfully a sharp message from the Lord;
Ioash commands him to be stoned for it, verse 21. But see Uerse 25. what an end
he came to shortly after: and observe, that (though he had many other sins,
yet) the Holy Ghost says, this was the sin that brought that ruin upon him.
The third of these Kings was Amaziah, 2. Chron. 25. 16. A Prophet came to him
in the Name of the Lord, and plainly reproved him; Amaziah rejects him with
great disdain: Have they made thee the Kings Counselor? Sir, must you direct
me, and tell me what I have to do? then he puts him to silence. But mark
what followed; the Prophet tells him plainly, he knew God had determined to
destroy him, because he had done that. And so it fell out indeed, verse 27. he
was murdered by treason. The fourth and last of these Kings was Uzziah, 2.
Chron. 26. he would needs (out of the pride of his heart) take upon him to
incroach upon the Priests office; the Priests withstood him, verse 19. he was
cruelly angry (as the word signifies) with the Priests, raging against them,
and threatening them: but what followed? even that which the Priests told him,
verse 18. Thou shall have no honor from the Lord God. The thing he respected
was his honor: forsooth, it was not for his honor, to be ruled by the
Priests; but what honor got he by it? First, he was smitten immediately,
while he was raging against the Priests, with a Leprosy, and the Leprosy rose
in his very forehead, verse 19. Secondly, verse 21. He was a Leper to the day
of his death, and dwelt as a Leper in an house apart, because he was cut off
from the house of the Lord. Thirdly, verse 23. After his death, they buried him
apart (though in the same field) from his Ancestors: for they said, He is a
Leper.

The Reasons of the Doctrine are these. 1. In respect of their gifts, there
Reas. 1.
is an honor due to the true Prophets and Ministers of God. It is a barbarous
thing, not to reverence and honor learning, and Gods gifts wheresoever we
discern them. Pro. 13. 15. Good understanding makes a man acceptable. And
Eccles. 8. 1. The wisdom of a man makes his face to shine. And above all
gifts and learning this deserves most honor, when a man has a gift to divide
the Word aright, rightly to interpret the Scriptures, and to apply them to the
use of Gods Church. When the Apostle had said, 1 Cor. 12. 31. Desire you the
best gifts: he comes to tell them which are the best gifts; and having showed
in general, Chap. 13. that no gifts are ought worth to a man's own comfort,
unless they be used in love, and care to profit others, he adds, Chap. 14.
1. Follow after love, and covet spiritual gifts; but rather that ye may
prophecy: And verse 5. I would that you all spoke with strange languages, but
rather that ye prophesied; for greater is he that prophesi^th, than he that
speaks with tongues.

2. In respect of their work and office that they are employed in, honor is
due unto them. For, how mean and base soever we are, yet is 2.
our office great and honorable. Luke 1. 15. He shall be great in the sight
of the Lord. We are the Messengers of the Lord of Hosts, ^al 2. 7. We are
Ambassadors for Christ, 1. Cor. 5. 20. Yea, we are his Messengers and Em
bassadours in matters concerning the soul, the precious soul of man; not in
matters of this life, but in the matters of God. Heb. 5. 1. The Priest was
taken from among men, and ordained for men in things pertaining to God. You
cannot have the means of salvation, the Word and Sacraments, but from us. 1.
Cor 4. 1. Let a man so esteem of us, as of the Ministers of Christ, and
Disposers of the Mysteries of God. Yea, you cannot have saving knowledge, nor
faith, nor regeneration, nor eternal life without us, ordinarily. Romans 10. 14.
How can they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? And how can they
hear without a Preacher? Ioh. ^0. 23. To us the keys of the Kingdom of
Heaven are committed. And (though it be certain that God has respect to the
Prayers of the meanest of the faithful, and it may fall out that many a
private Christian has also a better gif^ in prayer than many a good Minister,
yet) has the Lord more respect to the prayers of his Prophets and Ministers,
than to any other, and they are more effectual to the comfort of Gods people.
Genesis 20. 7. He is a Prophet, and he shall pray for thee, James 5. 14. Moses
and Aaron were among his Priests, and Samuel among such as call upon his Name:
these called upon the Lord, and he heard them, Psalm. 99. 6. So it is said, 2.
Chron. 30. 27. that at the end of the solemn passover that was kept by
Hezekiah, The Priests and the Levites arose, and blessed the People, and their
voice was heard, and their Prayer came up to heaven to his holy Habitation. In
respect of all this that I have said concerning the office and function of the
Minister, the Apostle tells the Corinthians, there was no proportion between
that they could give to their Ministers, and that they received from them. 2.
Cor. 9. 11. If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing
that we reap your carnal things? Yea, more than that, he tells Philemon,
verse 19. that he did owe to him, even his own self, And so much may every
faithful Minister say to so many as have been converted to God by his
Ministry.

The third Reason why the Lord makes such account of the honor of 3.
his Prophets, and is so highly displeased with the indignities that are done
unto them, is, because men cannot honor, nor esteem of their Doctrine and
Message, unless they honor and esteem of them. The contempt done to them,
reaches to the holy things they are employed in, and to the Lord himself. It
is not possible for a man to love the Word, but he must love and honor the
Ministers of it, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Gospel of
peace, Romans 10. 15. Ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your
rejoicing, 2. Cor. 1. 14. Nay, it is not possible for any man to love, or bear
honor to the Lord himself, but he must needs love, and honor the Prophets
and Messengers of God, he that despises you, despises me, Luke 10. 16. And
that is the cause why the Apostle is so importunate with the Thessalonians, to
persuade them to esteem well of their Ministers, we beseech you brethren to
know them, which labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish
you; And to esteem them very highly in love for their works sake, 1 Thessalonians.
5. 12, 13. And indeed this was the true cause, why our Savior in this place,
stood so much upon his honor (he would preach no where but where he might have
honor, and be well esteemed of) Why? was he a man that cared much for honor?
No, he professes of himself, and in his whole life made it good, Ioh. 8. 48,
49. I honor my Father, I seek not mine own praise. This was then the reason,
why he would preach no where, but where he might have honor, because he knew
none ^ould receive good by his Ministry, that did not esteem reverently of his
person. They that honor not the Teacher, cannot honor, nor profit by his
Doctrine.

IT follows now, that we proceed to the Uses of this Doctrine.

1. For us that are Ministers: That seeing there is an honor due unto us, and
it is not possible for us to do any good in our Ministry where we have no
honor; and all the honor that is due to us, is due to us only for our gifts,
and for our works sake: we should therefore be humbled in our selves, and
judge our selves unworthy to be employed in this function; and both before we
are entered, this should keep us from being ouer-hasty and forward to take this
calling upon us: and when we are entered, this should make us to walk in it
with fear and trembling. John the Baptist professed himself unworthy to be
employed, even in the basest office about Christ, not worthy to bear his
shoes, Matthew. 3. 11. not worthy to stoop down to untie the latchet of his
shoe, Mar. 1. 7. And Paul said he was unworthy to be called an Apostle, 1.
Cor. 15. 9. and having spoken of such an honor that belongs to our Ministry,
which (as one would have thought) would have puffed him up, rather than have
humbled him, he presently (as admiring that God should ever advance any mortal
man to that dignity) breaks out into these words, (...). Cor. (...). 16. Who
is sufficient for these things? For, as God never advanced any to honor above
others, but he requires some greater service from them than from others (in
omni honor est onus) in all honor there is a burden; to whom men have
committed much, of them they will ask the more, Luke 12. 48. In which respect
Saul, when he was called of God and his people unto the place of greatest
honor, shunned it as much as he could, and hid himself, 1. Sam. 10. 22. so
has it fallen out in this; No man that has rightly conceived of the burden
God has annexed to this honorable function, has been over hasty to take
this calling upon him, no man takes this honor to himself, but he that is
called of God, Heb. 5. 4. till God have even thrust him in (as it were) by
violence, by the head and shoulders. Two famous examples we have for this, the
one in Moses, who three several times hung of, and excused himself, Exodus 3.
11. and 4. 1. 10. 13. the other in Jeremy, who cried out thus, ah Lord God,
behold I cannot speak, for I am a child, Chap. 1. 6.

Every ignorant, idle, covetous, and scandalous Minister is apt to glory in
Application.
this Doctrine, and to challenge to himself this honor that is due to the
Ministers of the Gospel: but he never thinks of the burden God has annexed
to this honor.

The second Use of this Doctrine, is for the people; that seeing it is evident
by this Doctrine, that you owe us honor, neither can you profit by our 2.
Doctrine, unless you can give honor unto us: and, God esteems you as
dogs and swine, unworthy of the comfort of his Gospel, if you cannot esteem
of us: therefore it stands you upon, to learn what honor is due to us; and
when you know it, to give us our due in this kind. The Apostles rule is
general, Romans 13. 7. Render to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due,
fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.

First then you must know, that the honor you owe unto us, is not such as is
due to the Magistrates, and great men of the world; we do not challenge to our
selves, either that civil authority, or that reverence, or those titles, or
that outward pomp and state, or that wealth and abundance that is due unto
them. Our Savior Christ gives this for the reason, why he had not such a
retinue and company of servants, as might have rescued him from them that
apprehended him, because his Kingdom was not of this world, Ioh. 18. 36. The
chief honor that is due to us, is more inward and spiritual; and stands in
four points principally.

The first degree of honor that you owe to us, is in your minds and
judgments, that you rightly esteem of the need you have of Gods Ordinance 1.
in our Ministry, and of the inestimable benefit you receive by it. This is
that the Apostle teaches us, when he says, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 12. I besecch you
Brethren, that you know them that labor among you. And 1. Cor. 4. 1. Let a man
so account of us, as of the Ministers of Christ, and Stewards of the mysteries
of God. On the other side, a chief dishonor it is to the Ministry, when men
think it is a calling of no such necessity, but that they may well enough be
saved without it, as they did among the Corinthians that said they cared
neither for Paul, nor for Apollo, nor for Cephas, they were Christ's, they did
so wholly rely upon Christ for their salvation, as that they regarded not the
Ministry of any of his servants, 1. Cor. 1. 12. that they can profit better by
reading good Books, etc.

The second degree of honor you owe to us, is in your affections, that 2.
you reverence us in your hearts, and have us in singular love for our works
sake, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 13. You should count it your happiness, to have such
Teachers as you may reverence; for otherwise, you shall be able to profit
little or nothing by their Ministry. On the other fide, they are to be held
contemners of the Ministry, that desire none, but such as may be their
underlings, such as they may rule at their pleasure, even in the matter of
their Ministry, and prescribe unto them, what they shall preach and what they
shall not preach, and say, prophecy not unto us right things, speak unto us
smooth things, Esaias 30. 10. 12. or else such as are good-fellowes, whom they
may draw into any sin, that will drink with them, and game with them, and
swear with them, and play the wantons with them. Of these the Holy Ghost
speaks, Amos 2. 12. 13. Ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink, and commanded
the Prophets, saying, Prophecy not: Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart
is pressed, that is full of sheaues.

The third degree of honor you owe to us, is in your practice; when you yield
obedience to our Doctrine, and will be directed by us according to the 3.
Word of God, an obedience (doubtless) is due from the people of God to their
faithful teachers, I write to try, whether you be obedient in all things, 2.
Cor. 2. 9. Having confidence in thy obedience, I wrote unto thee, Philem. 21.
obey them that have the rule over you, and submit your selves, Heb. 13. 17. On
the other side, they will be found contemners of Gods Prophets, that will not
be directed by them, nor be obedient to their Doctrine, whatsoever respect
otherways they seem to show unto them. Whosoever shall not receive you-nor
bear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake of the dust
of your feet, Mat. 10. 14. They that will not hear, or be directed by our
doctrine, receive us not, but contemn us in an high degree. This was the
contempt that Amaziah did to the Prophet, for which the Lord destroyed him,
because thou have not hearkened unto my counsel, 2. Chron. 25. 16. For though
sin be the transgression of Gods Law, and the disobeying of him; yet is sin
greatly increased, by disobeying his Prophets and Messengers, He did that which
was evil in the fight of the Lord, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah
the Prophet speaking in the name of the Lord, 2. Chron. 36. 12. Therefore also
the Lord says, Ezekiel. 33. 33. that when that should come to pass (when the
judgment should fall upon them which he had threatened, verse. 27.) they should
then know that a Prophet had been among them. Their own conscience should in
their affliction aggrauate their sin against them by this circumstance, that
the Lord had sent his Prophet to them to admonish them, and they had not
regarded nor obeyed him.

The fourth degree of honor you owe to us, is in allowing us such maintenance,
such an estate and outward respect, as may serve to preserve our persons 4.
from contempt, this is that honor the Apostle means when he says, the
Elders that rule well, are worthy of double honor, specially such as labor in
the Word and doctrine. For the Scripture says, Thou shall not muzzle the ox
that treads out the corn: and, The labourer is worthy of his reward, 1. Tim.
5. 17, 18. For though (as I have said) we may neither challenge, nor accept of
that worldly honor and outward estate, as is due to Princes and great
Magistrates, yet what reverence may be given to private men, may be given to us
also. Yea it is not possible you should reverence us in your minds and hearts,
but you must needs give some outward respect and reverence unto us. Elizeus
(even in those times) was able to keep a man to attend him, 2. Reg. 4. 1^* and
6. 15. And such maintenance is to be allowed the Minister, as he may be both
comely (not base and sordid in apparel, or otherwise) and able also to keep
hospitality, 1. Tim. 3. (...). On the other side, it argues a great contempt
of the Ministry, when men seek of purpose to keep them bare as may be, lest
they should be too proud and presumptuous (as they call it) in their Ministry.
These are like those profane Soldiers, Mat. 27. 28, 29. who when they had
st^ipped our Savior, they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him. This also
shows what the reverence is, that many forward Christians seem to show to
Gods servants and Ministers. If they did indeed bear true love and reverence
to them, they would not be so careless in ministering to their necessities as
they are; much less would they rob them, by withholding that, which by Law
is due unto them.

Lecture the seventy nine. January 29. 1610. JOHN IIII. XLIIII.
WE have already heard, that these three Verses which do summarily contain
the History of Christ's return into Galile, do offer to our consideration
three principal points.

First, that our Savior, returning into Galile to exercise his Ministry there,
did of purpose refuse to go to Nazaret, and went into other towns of Galile,
Because he knew he could have no honor in Nazaret, verse. 43.

Secondly, the reason why he knew he could have no honor at Nazaret; Because
it was his own Country, verse 44.

Thirdly, the entertainment he found in those parts of Galile he resorted
unto, verse. 45.

The first of these three, we finished the last day; and now it follows that
we proceed to the second, which is contained in this verse; He knew he could
have no honor in Nazaret, because it was his own Country: it was the place
where he had lived long, even from his infancy, till he was about thirty years
old; the place where his parents and kinsfolk did dwell. Now because this
reason is somewhat strange, and given by Christ, not here only, but in sundry
other places of the Gospel, it shall be profitable for us to weigh and
consider it well, that so we may be the better able to receive our instruction
from it. First then it is to be observed, that he makes not this his own case
only, nor the fault of Nazaret, but the case of every true Prophet, what
Country soever he shall live in: for as here he speaks indefinitely, A
Prophet has none honor in his own Country; so Luke 4. 24. you shall find
it thus set down: No Prophet is accepted in his own Country. Secondly, that
he says, Mark 6. 4. the place where a Prophet wants this honor, is his
own Country, among his own kinsfolk, and in his own house: as if he should
say, It is rare to see him have honor in the town and place where he has
dwelt longest; but more rare among his own kinsfolks; and most rare of all in
his own house. The nearer any are to him in the bond of nature, in carnal
familiarity and acquaintance, as he is a man, the farther off shall he find
them, from yielding that honor and estimation that is due unto him, as he is a
Prophet of God. Thirdly, that he says, Matthew. 13. 57. and Mar. 6. 4. that a
Prophet is not without honor, save in his own Country: as if he should say,
He shall be sure of honor every where else. Fourthly, that he spoke this so
often: All the four Evangelists (as you have heard) mention this speech to have
been used by him at sundry times; as bewailing (upon sundry occasions) that
he could do no good in his own Country, and giving this for the reason of
it. Fifthly, and lastly, that he affirmed this with so earnest an asseueration:
for here it is said, Jesus himself had testified, that a Prophet has no
honor, etc. And Luke 4. 24. Uerily I say unto you, no Prophet is accepted in
his own Country.

These things thus observed, do yield us this instruction:

That the Ministers of God (for the most part) have least estimation in their
Doct. 2.
own Country: they that are nearest unto them in dwelling, in carnal kindred
and acquaintance, are of all others the farthest off from giving them that
honor that is due unto them.

Indeed this is not always so: for we shall read, that John the Baptist was
highly honored even by his own Countrymen. Matthew. 3. 5, 6. There ^nt out to
him all Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the Regionround about lordan, and
were baptized of him, confessing their sins. Yea, after his death they
retained an honorable opinion of him: for so we read, Matthew. 21. 26. All men
h^ld John for a Prophet. But for the most part it has ever been otherwise. So
soon as ever Joseph had showed himself a Prophet, he was no where so much
despised and hated as by his own Brethren; yea, it is twice said, verses 5.
and 8. They hated him so much the more, because of his dreams: And 6 19 Behold
this Dreamer comes. So when God had gi^en unto David, not only an Heroical
and Princely spirit to fight with Goliath, but also a Prophetical spirit to
declare unto Gods People their deliverance from him, he found not so much
contempt and disdain in all the host of Israel, as from his own Brother, 1.
Sam. 17. 28. Jeremy found not that bitterness and deadly malice, neither in
any of the Jews, nor in the Caldeans, as he did in the men of Anathoth his
own Countrymen and Kinsmen. Ier. 11. 21. The men of Anathoth sought his life,
and said; Prophecy not in the Name of the Lord, that thou dye not by our
hands. And Paul, in all the Countries that he came in, received not so many
contempts and indignities from any, as he did from the Jews. He was whipped
five times by them, and received every time forty stripes save one, 2. Cor. 11
24 So none esteemed more contemptibly of Christ, than his own Kinsmen, Mar. 3.
21. John 7. 5.

Well: we have seen sufficient proof of the Doctrine in all these examples;
let us consider now what might be the reason of this. In it self doubtless it
is a great favor of God, to send us such Prophets as have been bred and borne
amongst us, such as are of our own kindred and acquaintance, as is evident by
the promise God makes his people, Deuteronomy. 18. ^5. The Lord thy God will raise up
a Proph^t from among you, even of thy Brethren, to him ye shall hearken. So is
it also spoken of Amos, I raised up of your sons for Prophets; and of your
young men for Nazarites; is it not even thus O ye children of Israel says the
Lord? Amos 2. 11. How falls it out then, that for the most part, men esteem
not ofthis favor, and that they will hearken rather to any Prophet than to
such a one? The Reason thereof is to be imputed to Reason.
four common corruptions that the nature of man is tainted with. The first, is
envy and pride: the second, hypocrisy: the third, curiosity and desire of
novelty: the fourth, self-love, and desire to be flattered and soothed in
their sins.

The first Reason of this (I say) is that envy and pride that is in the nature
1.
of man. For we cannot endure, that one that we know is, or has been our
equal, or inferior, should take upon him to teach, and direct, and reprove
us as all true Prophets use to do Now every Prophet among his own Kindred and
Countrymen where he has been borne and and bred, is so; either they know him
to have been their inferior, in wealth, or parentage, or (at the most) that
he was once but their equal, their Schoolefellow, their play-fellow. This is
expressly noted for the cause, why our Savior was not esteemed at Nazaret. Mar.
6. 3. Is not this the Carpen^er, Marie's Son, the Brother of James and Ioses,
and of Judah, and Simon? and are not his Sisters here with us? and they were
offended in him (not at him) viz. even in his mean estate.

The second Reason of this, is the hypocrisy that is in the nature of man:
those whom they have conuersed long with, familiarly, they must needs 2.
observe sundry infirmities in them; and there is this hypocrisy in us, that
(though we think never the worse of our selves for many foul faults that are
in us, yet) we are apt to despise another for the least infirmity we discern
in him. All Gods graces are not of that force to move us to reverence and
honor him, as the least of his infirmities has to make us censure and despise
him. This corruption our Savior notes, Matthew. 7. 3. We are not only apt to
see the least moate in our Brothers eye, but also (as appears by comparing
verse 1. with 3, 4. apt to judge (that is, to censure) condemn, and despise
him for it. Specially in a Minister men look for Angelical perfection; a
Minister (they think) should be so holy that he should not need marriage; so
full of Faith, that he should not care for the things of this life, he should
not provide for his family, he should not require his tithes, nor his debts.
Neither can men (unless there be more in them than nature) reverence a
Minister, if they do discern the least blemish in him, or can but remember any
fault and infirmity they have known to be in him in times past. Yea, such
perfection we look for in Ministers, that we are apt to despise them, even for
the blemishes we discern in any that are near unto them; in their wives,
their children, their servants, their companions. Number. 12. 1. Aaron and Miriam
spoke against Moses, because of the Ethiopian Woman which he had married. This
corruption gave occasion to that Law which the Apostle gives, 1. Tim. 3. 2, 4.
That none should be chosen to be a Bishop, unless he be such a one, as is not
only unreprovable himself, but such a one also, as rules his own house
well, having his children in subjection with all honesty. To this corruption of
our nature Solomon seems to have respect in that saying, Eccles. 10. 1. Dead
Flies putrify the precious ointment of the Apothecary, and cause it to stink:
so does a little folly him that is in estimation for wisdom and glory. It
does so indeed, but that is through our corruption; for it ought not to do so.

The third Reason, why (for the most part) a Prophet has no honor 3.
in his own Town, in the place where he has long lived, is the curiosity
that is in the nature of man, and desire of nouelty. For, naturally we loath
those blessings that are common, and which we have long enjoyed; and esteem
more of that that is new and strange, though it be indeed of less worth than
the other. Though Manna were the excellentest food that ever mortal man did
live upon; yet when the Israelites had been used to it a while, they loathed
it, and preferred the fish, and cucumbers, and onions, and garlic of Egypt
before it, Number. 11. 5, 6. Of this corruption the Apostle speaks, 2. Tim. 4.
3. Men will not endure wholesome doctrine: and why so? They have itching ears,
and will, after their lusts, get them an heap of Teachers. Their own food,
be it never so wholesome, they cannot endure; they must have variety, that that
is new and strange, and that (not because they may profit more by them, than by
their own, as sometimes it falls out) but only to feed this itching humor
of curiosity. This is the cause, why the Apostle is so earnest with the
people, even with the people of God, with good people, to esteem well of their
own Pastors, And we beseech you brethren, know them which labor among you,
and are over you in the Lord, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 12. Obey them which have the rule
over you, for they watch for your souls as they that must give account, Heb.
13. 17.

The fourth and last Reason, is the self-love that is in all men by nature, 4.
and great desire to be flattered in their sins. For the Minister that has
lived long among them, knows them better than any stranger, and is able more
particularly to touch, and reprove their sins. If he in his doctrine do but
come near any corruption they know themselves guilty of (though he know no
such thing by them, nor once think of them) they judge presently he aymeth at
them, he intends to disgrace them. Though a stranger inueigh against their
sins, every whit as particularly and sharply as their own Pastor; yet
(because they think he knows nothing by them, he aymeth not at them) they
can take it in good part, and commend him too. This was the cause of the hatred
Ahab bare both to Eliah, 1. Reg. 21. 20. and to Micaiah, 1. Reg. 22. 8.

We have heard the four Reasons of the Doctrine: let us now come to the Uses
of it. For it is a Doctrine of good Use, both for us Ministers, and Use.
for all you that are the people of God.

1. For us that are Ministers. This Doctrine serves to exhort us to use all
good means to preserve the credit and estimation of our persons in the hearts
of Gods people. This we are bound to do, 1. Tim. 4. 12. Let no man despise thy
youth. Tit. 2. 15. See that no man despise thee. For, if we lose our reverence
and estimation in the hearts of Gods people, our Doctrine will do them no good.
And we may perceive by this Doctrine, how apt the people are to despise us,
specially when we have lived long amongst them. It stands us upon therefore,
so much the more carefully to use all good means, whereby we may maintain our
estimation in their hearts. And I find in Gods Word three special means,
whereby this may be done:

First, by our Diligence and Care to teach profitably. That is the chief 1.
thing that will procure us reverence and estimation, if we do our work well.
1 Thessalonians. 5. 13. Have them in singular love for their works sake. This is
that, that the Apostle teaches, 2. Tim. 2. 15. Study to show thy self
approved unto God, a Worke-man that needs not be ashamed, dividing the Word
of God aright. And, 1. Timothy 4. having charged Timothy verse 12. too look
to it, that no man despise his Youth: he tells him by what means he may
preserve his Person and Ministry from contempt and disdain, verse 13. and
stands principally upon this, Give attendance to reading, to exhortation, and
to doctrine. Verse 14. Despise not the ^ift that is in thee: but stir it up,
and seek to increase it; And adds, verse 15. These things exercise, and give
thy self unto them, that it may be seen how thou profitest among all men. If
this care and conscience be in us, we shall be sure to have honor, though
Satan and all the world should conspire to disgrace us, A Prophet (a true and
faithful Prophet he means) is not without honor, Matthew. 13. 57. Mar. 6. 4.
If this be wanting, no wealth, no titles, no hospitality, no good works we can
do, will be able to preserve us from contempt.

The second means, is by our faithfulness in our ministry. This differs
from the former; for a man may be a diligent and very sufficient Teacher, 2.
and yet not faithful in his Ministry. This is faithfulness, when we are
careful to deliver the whole counsel of God to his people, not concealing any
part of it for favor, or fear of any man. Ier. 23. 28. He that has my Word,
let him speak my Word faithfully. 1. Cor. 4. 2. It is required of Gods
Stewards, that every man be found faithful. 2. Tim. 2. 2. What things thou
have heard of me, the same deliver to faithful men, which shall be able to
teach others. This has great force to procure us reverence in the hearts of
all men. When the Pharisees would give a reason of the reverence they pretended
to bear to our Savior, they give this, Matthew. 22. 16. Master, we know that
thou are true, and teach the way of God truly, neither carest for any man;
for thou considerest not the person of man. And when the Apostle charge Titus
to look to it, that no man despise him, he prescribes him this way, to keep
himself from contempt. Tit. 2. 15. These things speak, and exhort, and
rebuke, with all authority, see that no man despise thee. Titus might have
said, This was a strange direction; this is the way rather to procure us the
contempt and hatred of all men, if we shall not only teach such particular
duties as he had mentioned before, but apply them also so particularly, by
exhorting, and rebuking men, specially, if we do it with such authority and
boldness, as thou speak off. No (says the Apostle) fear it not, this will
gain thee estimation and honor in the hearts of men, yea, of all men; yea,
even of them that were most offended with thee for thy faithfulness, if they
belong to God. And this is that that Solomon says, Pro. 28. 23. He that
rebukes a man, shall find more favor at the length, than he that flattereth
with his tongue. On the other side, if a man will make himself a base
underling to any, in the matter of his Ministry, so as he dares not deliver
some parts of Gods truth, he dares not reprove some faults for fear of man;
if he had all the learning in the world, yet shall he have no true honor; for
thus says the Lord, speaking to the Priests and Teachers of his People, Mal.
2. 9. Therefore have I also made you to be despised, and vile before all the
People, because you have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the Law.

The third and last mean we are to use to maintain our honor and estimation
in the hearts of Gods people, is to make our selves an example and pattern to
them, in all the duties of holiness toward God, and righteousness toward men;
and to show care of this, not in our selves only, but in all that are of our
family also. This direction is given, Tit. 1. 6. He must be unreprovable; and
not so only, but his children also must be faithful, not scandalous for riot,
neither disobedient. See the great force that this has to gain reverence to
our Persons and Ministry, in two examples, 1. Tim. 4. 12. Let no man despise
thy youth, but be unto them that believe, an example in word, in conversation,
in love, in spirit, in faith, and in pureness. The other is in John Baptist:
see what honor the holiness of his life did gain him with all men, Mar. 6.
20. Herod reverenced John, because he knew him to be a just man, and an holy.
Insomuch, as though he did hate him for his faithfulness, and persecuted him
to the death, yet he did it against his conscience; and that was the cause, why
it was after, such a vexation and torment unto him: When he heard of the fame
of Jesus, he thought straight of John Baptist, Mar. 6. 14. John Baptist is
risen from the dead: And 6. 16. When Herod heard it, he said, It is John, whom
I beheaded. As if he should say, This will never out of my Conscience, that he
was a good man, and a just, and I hated him for his faithfulness, I troubled
and persecuted him. On the other side, had we all the means in the world to
make us great, yet if our selves make not conscience of the things we teach
others, yea, if we be not careful to put all iniquity far from our
Tabernacles, we shall grow contemptible and vile; for the mouth of the Lord
has spoken it. See two plain proofs of this, the one is Esaias 43. 27, 28. Thy
Teachers have transgressed against me: therefore have I profaned the Rulers of
my Sanctuary: The other place for this, is 1. Sam. 2. 30. in the example of
Eli: he was himself unreprovable, but because he had not that care he should
have had of his family, but suffered his children to run to riot, to the
great scandal of the Church, the Lord threatens to bring great contempt upon
him; and thereupon gives this general Rule, Them that honor me, I will
honor, and they that despise me (mine Ordinances, my Word, my worship) shall
be despised. A sentence worthy to be often thought upon, by us specially that are
Ministers; and not by us only, but by all men, as being spoken by him that is
able to make his word good, that is able to pour contempt even upon Princes,
1. Sam. 2. 30. Them that honor me, I will honor, and they that despise me,
shall be despised.

Lecture the eighty. February 12. 1610. JOHN IIII. XLIIII.
IT remains now, that we proceed to the second Use this Doctrine serves
unto. The Use therefore that the people of God are to make of this Doctrine, is
this, That for as much as 1. Our Savior here notes it for a great sin in
all such as cannot honor a Prophet if he be their own Countryman: and that
2. Christ for this cause refused to teach at Nazareth: and that 3. They can
receive no profit by the Doctrine of their Teachers if upon any pretense they
despise their persons: and that 4. The chief cause why men refuse to give due
respect unto their own Prophets, are those four faults which I spoke of in
the Reason of this Doctrine: That therefore all the faithful would take heed
of, and labor to arm themselves against these four corruptions, which are in
the nature of every one of us, and which if we take not good heed unto, we
shall never be able to yield that honor that is due to the Ordinance of God in
the Ministry of his servants. I will therefore speak of all these four
corruptions particularly, and give you remedies against them out of the Word of
God.

The first of these four corruptions (as we have heard) is Pride. We disdain
to be directed and reproved by such, as we know to be no better men than our
selves, specially, if we know them to be our inferiors, men of baser or meaner
estate in the world than our selves. For we are apt to think that every
Preacher, that with any plainness and power admonishes, and reprooueth our
sins, seeks to usurp authority, and to reign as a Lord or Pope over us, to
hold our heads under his girdle; and that we can by no means endure. Hereupon
it is, that you shall seldom hear any fall out with a faithful Minister, but
they will be ready to vpbraid him with the means of his estate, and to charge
him with pride; that he being no better a man should take so much upon him:
though in no other thing he show himself proud, but in the plainness of his
Ministry only. Thus did the Sodomites reject the most humble admonition of Lot,
Genesis 19. 9. He is come alone as a stranger, and shall he judge and rule? Thus
did Corah, with his Company, reject the Ministry of Moses and Aaron, though
Moses were the meekest man upon earth. Number. 16. 3. Ye take too much upon you --
wherefore lift ye your selves above the Congregation of the Lord?

Now there be four excellent remedies given us in Gods Word against this
corruption.

1. To consider it is no pride nor presumption in the Minister of Christ (how
mean a person soever he be in worldly respects) to urge all men to yield
obedience to the Word, to reprove the sins of any man, yea, to do this plainly
and boldly, as one having authority; for he has a commission and calling from
God to do this, Tit. 2. 15. These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with
all authority; see that no man despise thee: Yea, we are bound to do this upon
pain of Gods Curse, Ier. 1. 17. Speak unto them all that I command thee; be
not afraid of their faces, lest I destroy thee before them. Why should any
then count it pride in us to do that, that we have so good a warrant to do,
and that God has so straightly charged us to do?

2. The second remedy against this pride, is to consider, that the message is
to be regarded, not according to the worth of him that brings it, but of him
from whom it comes: look not (in the ministry of the Word) to the meandness
and baseness of the messenger, but to the Majesty of him that has sent him to
speak to thee in his Name. 2. Cor. 5. 20. Now then we are Ambassadors for
Christ -- we pray you (we teach you, exhort you* reprove you) in Christ's stead.
When thy heart begins to rise at any thing thou hear taught, and urged
upon thy conscience out of Gods Word, say as Joseph did, Genesis 50. 19. Am not I
under God? This man (me thinks) is some what too plain, somewhat too bold,
somewhat too bitter: but whose Word is it that he speaks, in whose Name does
he speak unto me? Am not I under God? Hear ye, and give ear, be not proud,
for the Lord has spoken, Ier. 13. 15. We do not require you to give that
respect to every thing we say: if we speak our own fantasies, reject them in
Gods Name: but if we speak nothing but upon warrant of Gods Word, take heed
how you reict it, how you spurn against it for our sakes. Acts 9. 5. It is
hard for thee to kick against the pricks. Does the Word prick thee? think
not thou shall find any ease by spurning and kicking against it. Job 9. 4. Who
has been fierce against the Lord, and has prospered? I beseech you all (as
you love your own souls) take heed, lest while you think you fret and rage
only against us poor men, you fret not, nor rage against God and his Word:
for Matthew. 21. 44. Whosoever shall fall on this stone, he shall be broken,
and on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. This was that
that kept Eli from fretting at, or disdaining of Samuel, when he had delivered
a very sharp and bitter message from the Lord unto him, 1. Sam. 3. 18. It is
the Lord. And this kept the Galatians from despising Paul, Gal. 4. 13, 14. When
through the infirmity of the flesh, he preached the Gospel to them at the
first, the trial of him, which was in his flesh, they despised not: Why?
Because they received him as an Angel (or Messenger) of God, yea as Christ
Jesus. They considered who had sent him, and in whose Name he came unto them.

3. The third remedy against this pride, is to consider, that it makes much
for Gods glory, to teach thee by such mean persons. Herein a notable
difference may be discerned, between the wisdom of God, and the wisdom of
man. The wisdom of man would think, that God should have gained and won
more a great deal to the obedience of his Gospel, if he would have employed
such in the work of the Ministry, as had been men of state and pomp in the
world; but God (in his wisdom) has judged the quite contrary: he has from
the beginning made choice of such to be his Ministers, as have been of very
mean estate in the world. 1. Cor. 1. 28. Vile things of the world, and things
which are despised, has God chosen. And why has this seemed good to the
wisdom of God? the Apostle gives the reason, 2. Cor. 4. 7. We have this
treasure in earthly vessels: and what he means by earthly vessels, he
expresses, verse 8, 9. We are afflicted, says he, we are in poverty, we are
persecuted. But why did the Lord suffer his Ambassadors to live in so base an
estate? who would have thought, that ever such poor contemptible persons
should have done any good, or that any respect should have been given to their
ministry? Surely, the Apostle gives the reason, verse 7. That the excellency of
the power may be of God, and not of us: as if he should say, If men of wealth,
or power, or authority in the world, should have been employed in this work
of converting souls, the good that had been done, would have been ascribed
to their wealth and authority, rather than unto God.

4. The fourth and last remedy against this corruption, is to consider, 4.
that it is greatly for our benefit, that God gives us such Ministers, rather
than such as are much our superiors in the world: for though (as I have showed
you, when I spoke of the honor that is due to the Ministers of the Gospel)
there ought to be that outward estate and maintenance yielded to the Ministers
of the Gospel, as may keep their persons and calling from contempt of the
people; yet it is (doubtless) a great benefit to the people of God, when they
have such Ministers, as are not by their outward estate, lifted so high above
them, but that they may be bold to make the doubts and distresses of their
conscience known to them, and go unto them for direction and advice. This is
that that Elihu speaks unto Job, Job. 33. 6, 7. Behold, I am according to thy
wish, in Gods stead; I also am formed out of the clay: Behold, my terror shall
not make thee afraid, etc.

2. The second corruption that keeps men from giving that reverence to Gods
Ministers (specially their own) that they ought, is Hypocrisy, that men
cannot reverence the ministry of that man, in whom they have espied any
weaknesses or infirmities. And this also is a very common corruption among
men, as I showed you the last day. And there be four remedies also against
this.

1. The first is this, Gods people should be loath and unwilling to see the
infirmities of their Ministers. I speak not to excuse the gross faults and
scandalous crimes of any Minister, nor to persuade you to think every thing
well done, that is done by us; but this I say, that because a Christian is
bound to reverence every true Prophet and Minister of God, or else he shall
never be able to profit by his ministry: that therefore he should rather set
his eye upon Gods ordinance, and the good things that are in them, and that
they receive by them; than upon their infirmities. This wisdom is taught us
in the example of Sem and Iaphet, the sons of Noah, Genesis 9. 23. when Cham had
seen and looked upon his fathers nakedness, and told them of it with delight,
and provoked them to do so too, They took a garment, and put it upon both
their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their
father, with their faces backward; so they saw not their fathers nakedness.

2. The second remedy is, that we should not look for Angelical perfection in
any of Gods servants; but make account, that they are men as well as you,
subject to the same infirmities that your selves are. True it is, they ought to
be patterns and examples to the flock, 1. Tim. 4. 12. But yet the best
Ministers that ever were, have had some wants or errors in their judgment:
(you know who it was that said, we know in part, and we prophecy in part, 1.
Cor. 13. 9.) have bewrayed some impotency and weakness, in governing and
moderating their passions, we also are men of like passions with you, Acts 14.
15. yea, have showed some frailty, and committed some slips in their lives and
conuersations with men, in many things we offend all, Iam. 3. 2. and therefore
this should not be a matter of wonder, or offense unto us.

3. Consider that their Ministry, and the Ordinance of God, is never the less
to be regarded, nor shall be ever a whit the less effectual to thy comfort,
for their infirmities, if the fault be not in thy self, Matthew. 23. 2, 3. The
people of God were bound to observe and do, whatsoever the Scribes and
Pharisees, sitting in Moses chair (that is, teaching the Doctrine of Moses)
did bid them to do, though they themselves were most wicked men; much less
may the small infirmities of a godly Minister, privilege the people, to make
light account of his wholesome Doctrine. Paul rejoices that Christ was
preached, even by those that preached him with an intent to add affliction to
his bands, Phil 1. 18. which he would never have done, if the gross sins of
the Minister (much less if his small infirmities) had force to make the holy
Doctrine he delivered, unavailable to the comfort of Gods people. The
infirmities of Gods servants, shall not hinder the fruit of their Ministry, nor
cause God to withhold his blessing from it. This is plain in the example of
Jonah, whose Ministry became effectual to the conversion of the Ninevites,
Jonah 3. 4, 5. though he himself had many and strange infirmities, Ion. 1. 2.
5. and 4. 1.

4. Lastly, it makes much for your benefit, that God teaches you not by
Angels, nor by men of Angelical perfection, but by poor weak men, that are
sinners as well as you: for by this means, we are able to teach you with more
feeling, experience, and compassion, than otherwise we could do. This is that
which the Apostle teaches concerning the High Priest under the Law. Heb. 5. 2.
He was able, sufficiently to have compassion on them that were ignorant, and
that were out of the way, because that he also was compassed with infirmity.
So that we see the infirmities we discern in Gods Ministers, are no just cause
why we should despise or contemn their Ministry.

3. The third corruption which causes men to contemn the Ministers of God
(specially their own Pastors) is curiosity and desire of nouelty, because men
cannot esteem of those blessings that they have long enjoyed, but still desire
variety and change; men are apt to grow weary of their own Minister (be their
gifts never so good) and to prefer a stranger before him, though his gifts
be far inferior to their own.

The remedies I will give you against this corruption, are these three.

1. The people of God owe most reverence and love to their own Pastors,
specially if they be such, as in whose Ministry they have already found the
blessing of God, and cooperating of his Spirit: to such I say, they owe more
respect, than to any other, though their gifts be greater. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 12, 13.
Now I beseech you brethren, know them that labor among you, and are over you
in the Lord, and admonish you, and have them in singular love. That was the
cause, why the Apostle was so careful to commend to the people of God their
own Pastors; as Tychicus to the Ephesians, 6. 21. Epaphroditus to the
Philippians, 2. 25, 26. Epaphras to the Colossians, 1. 7. and 4. 12, 13.
Therefore also Gods servants may, without any presumption, challenge a more
special respect from their own people, than from any other; as Samuel says
to Saul. 1. Sam. 15. 1. The Lord sent me to anoint thee King over his people:
now therefore obey the voice of the word of the Lord. So Paul to the
Corinthians, 1. Epist. 4. 15. Though ye have ten thousand instructers in
Christ, yet ye have not many fathers.

2. The people of God may receive much more good, and expect a greater blessing
from God, by hearing constantly one and the same man, than by hearing now one,
and then another. For this in a special sort is Gods ordinance, that every
flock should have a Pastor of their own, on whom they may depend, and whom
they may hear constantly, 1. Pet. 5. 2. Feed the flock of Christ that
depends upon you. Acts 14. 23. They ordained them Elders in every
Congregation.

3. Lastly, there is no just occasion given to any to loath or be weary of the
Ministry of any of Gods faithful servants, how often, or how long soever they
have heard them. For though they hear the same men, they shall not hear the
same things; but they shall have variety and choice enough, even at their own
table, if their Minister be a faithful steward. Matthew. 13. 52. He brings
forth out of his storehouse things both new and old. Cant. 7. 13. In our gates
are all sweet things, both new and old. Eccles. 12. 9, 10. The good Preacher
searches forth and prepares many Parables, he seeks to find out pleasant
words, and an upright writing. Yea, though he teach but the same things, that
thou have often heard, yet if thou were such a Hearer as were renewed in the
spirit of thy mind, thou would find small cause to complain, Behold it is
a weariness, Mal. 1. 13. For, as they that have Gods spirit, when they give
God praises, even for those blessings which they have long enjoyed, and often
praised God for, do yet sing. as it were a new song, Reu. 14. 3. so do they,
when they hear the same things they have often heard, always find some new
increase; either of knowledge, or of holy affections; so as they hear it
always as a new Doctrine.

The fourth and last corruption, that alienates the heart of Gods people from
his faithful Ministers, specially from their own Pastors, is felfe-loue, and
desire to be flattered and soothed up in their sins. Their own Pastor, that
knows them, deals (they think) too particularly in his Ministry; in all
his Doctrines and Reproves he points at them.

The Remedies against this corruption are these four:

1. To consider, that the Minister should desire to have that knowledge of all
his hearers, that he may be able to speak as particularly to every one as is
possible. Ier. 6. 27. I have set thee in a Watchtower among my people, that
thou may know, and try their ways. Though he may not make private faults
public, or so touch the sin, as he note and disgrace the person; yet he may
apply his reproves particularly, so as the party himself that is guilty, may
know, and feel himself touched with the reproof. Thus dealt Nathan with
David, 2. Sam. 12. 7. Yea, he ought to be as particular as he can in his
Ministry; it is the life and excellency of Preaching. We must in preaching aim
as directly as we can, at him whom we desire to profit. Our Doctrine must be as
a garment, fitted for the body it is made for; a garment that is fit for every
body, is fit for no body. Paul says of himself, Col 1. 26. that in his
preaching he labored to admonish every man, to teach every man, to present
every man perfect in Christ Jesus.

2. It may well be, that our ministry may touch your sins particularly, and
hit upon the very secret thoughts that are in your hearts, and upon the words
you have spoken in your privy Chambers, though we our selves know no such
matter by you. For, the Word is a searcher, and discouerer of the secrets of
the heart, as the Lord himself is, Heb. 4. 12. and compared in that respect to
light, all things that are reproved (or fit to be reproved) are made manifest
by the light, Ephesians. 5. 13. And we should be so far from fretting at the
Ministry of the Word for this, as we should honor it for nothing more; as
acknowledging in this, the cooperation of Gods spirit with it, as that man did
of whom the Apostle speaks, 1. Cor. 14. 24, 25. He is convinced of all, he is
judged of all: And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest, and so
falling down on his face, he will worship God, and report that God is in you
of a truth.

3. It is profitable for you to be particularly spoken to in the Ministry of
the Word, yea, you should desire it always when you come to hear. Psalm 85. 8,
I will hearken what the Lord God will say (in, or to me, secundum 72. and
vulgatam Latinam) for he will speak peace to his people, and to his Saints. As
if he should have said, If I be one of Gods people, how much soever Gods Word
seems to be against me, yet I know it will in the end tend to my comfort.
Thus he esteemed of it, Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness,
and let him reprove me, Psalm. 141. 5. and thus God says his Word will ever
prove to them that be upright, do not my words doegood, to him that walks
uprightly? Micah 2. 7. And indeed this is the wisdom of a Christian in his
hearing. Pro. 14. 8. The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way.

4. If that that is spoken, be according to the Word, thou ought humbly to
receive it, and take heed how thou spurn against it. whatsoever thou think
the Preachers affection was in delivering it. Remember how great a sin, and
dangerous a sign it is to stumble at the Word, the Apostle makes this a
property of most wicked men, and such as shall have no benefit by Christ, and
says they were (in Gods eternal counsel) appointed thereunto, 1. Pet. 2. 8.
Yea, consider that it is a dangerous sin, thus to censure and judge of the
Preachers purpose and affection, when thou can not justly blame any thing he
has said, this people are as they that strive with the Priest, Hosea 4. 4.

Lecture the eighty one. February 19. 1610. JOHN IIII. XLV.
WE have already heard that in this, and the two former Verses, three
principal things were offered to our consideration.

First, our Saviors refusing to exercise his Ministry at Nazaret; Because he
knew he could have no honor there.

Secondly, the Reason why he could have no honor there; Because it was his
own Country.

Thirdly, the entertainment he found in other parts of Galile, though he could
have none in Nazaret, his own town.

The two first points we have already finished, and now it remains that we
proceed unto the last, which is set down in this verse. And in it three
things also are to be observed. First, the readiness of the Galileans to
entertain Christ and his Ministry, in these words, Then when he was come into
Galile, the Galileans received him. Secondly, the Reason why they were so ready
to give him this entertainment, in these words, They had seen all the things
that he did at Jerusalem at the Feast. Thirdly, the occasion whereby they came
to see all those things, that he had done at Jerusalem at the feast, in these
words, For they went also unto the Feast. Now for the first of these three
parts, it is first to be enquired, what the Evangelist means, when he says
here, the Galileans received him: and we shall find men have been said to
receive Gods Prophets, 1. When they have harbored them, and entertained them
with love and kindness to their persons, as Matthew. 10. 41. He that receives a
Prophet in the Name of a Prophet, and a righteous man in the Name of arighteous
man: and that is expounded, verse 42. Whosoever shall give to one of these
little ones to drink, a cup of cold water, etc. And in this sense the
Galileans received Christ, for he found not so much kindness this way in any,
as in the Galileans, Matthew. 27. 55. Those good Women which had ministered to him
of their substance in his life time, and showed more love to him at his death
than the Apostles themselves did, and after his death provided carefully for
his burial; were such as had followed him from Galile. 2. When men have
willingly heard them, and obeyed their doctrine, they have been said to
receive Gods Prophets. Matthew. 10. 14. Whosoever shall not receive you, nor
hear your words. And in this sense also the Galileans received him; for they
heard him gladly, and flocked after him: all their Synagogues were open to him.
Matthew. 4. 23. He went about all Galilee, preaching in their Synagogues. Yea,
they so followed him, not on the Sabbath only, but on other days, that they
gave him no rest. In so much as when he being at Capernaum had gotten out
privily before day out of Peter's house, where he lay, into a solitary place to
retire himself, first Peter, and some with him, went to look for him, and
when they had found him, told him, All men seek for thee, Mar. 1. 37. And
after it is said, Luke 4. 42. The People sought him, and came to him, and kept
him that he should not depart from them: Neither would they have suffered him
to have gone, but that he told them, verse 43. Surely, I must preach the
kingdom of God to other Cities: for therefore am I sent.

Now from this, that our Savior that could have no honor in Nazaret, found
such entertainment among the rest of the Galileans; this Doctrine arises for
our instruction:

That the true Prophets and Messengers of God, shall be sure to find some
Doct. 3.
that will receive them and their Ministry, though they be rejected by others.
See the proof of this in three points. First, they shall be sure to find some,
that will reverence and honor them for their gifts and calling, Mat. 13. 57. A
Prophet is not without honor. Secondly, they shall be sure to find some
friends, that will be ready to show kindness to them. Every faithful man has
a promise, that God will minister unto his necessities; that though he cannot
be sure he shall be rich, and live plentifully, yet he may be sure to have that
that God shall see needful and good for him: he shall have sufficiency. Psalm.
34. 10. They that seek the Lord, shall want nothing that is good. And 37. 19.
In the days of famine they shall have enough. So verse 25. I have been young,
and now am old, yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken. But no faithful
man has so many promises for this, as the faithful Minister has. Deuteronomy. 10.
9. Leui has no part nor inheritance with his brethren: for the Lord is his
inheritance, as the Lord thy God has promised him. Therefore, when Christ had
in the first sending out of his Apostles, given them a charge which was
peculiar to them, and to them for that time also (as appears, by that which
our Savior said unto them. Luke 22. 36. but now he that has a purse let him
take it, and likewise his scrip. And by that which is said of Paul's cloak which
he left at Troas, 2. Tim. 4. 13.) Matthew. 10. 9, 10. Provide not gold, nor
silver, nor money, nor a scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither
shoes, nor a staff: he gives a reason that is common to all faithful
Ministers with them; For the workman is worthy of his meat. Yea, as Luke 10.
7. has it, The labourer is worthy of his wages: and wages (we know) if it be
just and equal, is more than will serve for food. And Luke 22. 35. he seeks
to confirm them by that experiment, When I sent you without bag, or scrip,
or shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. Thirdly, they shall be
sure to find some, that will receive their Doctrine also, and profit by it.
This is plain in the Parable of the sower: the sower loses not all his seed;
but though some fell on the high way, and some on stony ground, and some among
thorns, yet some fell in good ground, Mar. 4. 8. 20. So we shall find in the
story of the Acts of the Apostles, that notwithstanding the places they went
to, were deeply settled, and strongly rooted in Idolatry, and that also, they
ever met with most bitter opposition of the Jews, yet they never preached any
where, but some received profit by them. This is noted at Paul's being at
Thessalonica. Acts 17. 4. Some of them believed, and joined in company with
Paul and Silas. And at Athens, verse 34. though some mocked, and others were in
suspense, Howbeit certain men claue unto Paul, and believed. And at Rome, Acts
28. 24. Some were persuaded with the things that were spoken, and some believed
not.

The Reason of this Doctrine is this, That God makes that precious account of
the Ministry of his Gospel, that he never bestows it upon Reason.
any place, were he has not some of his Elect. Other blessings God bestows
in as great plenty upon Reprobates, as upon his Elect. Eccles. 9. 2. All things
come alike to all, and the same condition is to the just, and to the wicked.
But this blessing God gives to no place, where he has not some people to
save. This the Lord expressed unto Paul, when he gives him the reason, why he
would have him preach at Corinth, Acts 18. 9, 10. Fear not, but speak, and
hold not thy peace -- for I have much people in this City. And Christ gives
this for a reason, why he sent forth the Seventy, because the Lords harvest was
then great; God had much good corn to gather into his barn, Luke 10. 2. And
the Apostle, when he would prove, that God had an Elect people among the
Gentiles, and had a purpose to save the Gentiles, uses this argument to prove
it by, Romans 10. 18. But I demand, have they not heard? no doubt, their sound
went throughout all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world. Now
if God never send his Prophets and Messengers to any people, but where he has
some of his Elect, then can they not choose but find some that will honor
them, some that will be kind unto them; yea (which is more) some that will
hear, and receive their Doctrine. For so says our Savior, John 10. 27. My
sheep hear my voice.

The Use of this Doctrine, is for our encouragement that are Ministers of the
Gospel, against the general contempt and hatred that is borne (not to our
persons only, but) to our Doctrine and Ministry also. 1. Though no man
regarded us nor our Ministry, yet if we have the testimony of a good
conscience, every one of us may comfort our selves, as the Prophet does Esaias
49. 4, 5. My judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God, though
Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and
my God shall be my strength. But yet the Lord has given us this further
encouragement, That if the fault be not in our selves, we shall not want
honor, maintenance, or success; but though many do despise us, yet some
shall receive us, esteem of us, love us, and hear us with delight and profit.
And we have more cause of comfort in the love of one good man, that fears
God, how poor soever, than we have cause of discouragement, in the hatred and
scorn of an hundred wicked men. Yea certainly our hearts are not upright in
us, if we be not of this mind. This was David's mind, Psalm. 119. 79. Let such
as fear thee, turn unto me, and such as know thy testimonies.

2. The second Use of this Doctrine, is for the reproof of wicked men, that
receive us not. This example of the rest of the Galileans, did doubtless
increase the condemnation of them of Nazaret, in rejecting Christ. Many flatter
themselves in this, and think it is no sin, to despise Preachers and
Preaching, because it is the fashion; all men do so. For this is certainly a
great comfort to wicked men, to see that many do, as they do, or worse then
they do. Ezekiel. 16. 54. Judah by her sins comforted Sodom and Samaria. But
know thou, though this be a poor and wretched comfort, yet thou shall not have
so much as this to comfort thee. For thou see, there be many that esteem us
and our Ministry, Wisdom is justified of her children, Matthew. 11. 19. yea
many of thine own sort and rank, Gentlemen as thou art, Seruing-men as thou
art, Husbandmen and Tradesmen as thou art, men of as good calling and degree as
thy self, men of poor estate as thy self; this is that, that will one day
confound thee: yea, say they were all thy inferiors, their example in this
will confound thee. 1. Cor. 1. 27. God has chosen the foolish things of this
world, to confound the wise: their zeal will confound thy backwardness, their
love, thy hatred and malice. Yea, this thine own conscience knows well; and
that is the cause, why thou frettest so to hear and see this, that there be so
many resort to our Ministry, so many that love and esteem us, Mark. 11. 18.

Follows now the reason that moved the Galileans to receive Christ; They had
seen all the things, that he did at Jerusalem, at the Feast. Why? what did he
at the Feast? Surely, there is nothing expressed that he did, but that, John 2.
15. He made a scourge, and drove all out of the Temple that sold oxen, and
sheep, and doves, and poured out the changers money, and overthrew the tables.
Yet it is certain, he did there at that time many miracles, though it be not
expressed what they were: for so it is said, When he was in Jerusalem at the
Passover, many believed in him when they saw the miracles that he did, Ioh. 2.
23. And Nicodemus was drawn to believe that he was come from God, because of
the miracles that he had done, Ioh. 3. 2. And here we see the fruit and use of
those miracles: they that saw them, were made willing to receive and hear him.
The Doctrine then is this, That the chief end of all true miracles, Doct. 4.
has been to gain credit and estimation to the Doctrine and Word of God. This
is evident in the miracles of the Prophets; when Eliah had restored the child
of the widow of Sarepta, she said unto him, 1. Reg. 17. 22. Now I know, that
thou art a man of God, and that the Word of the Lord in thy mouth is true. The
like we see in the miracles of the Evangelists and Apostles, Acts 8. 6. The
people gave beed to those things that Philip spoke, with one accord, hearing
and seeing the miracles that he did. And Acts 13. 12. When the Deputy saw what
was done (upon Elymas, stricken blind by Paul) be believed, and was astonished
at the Doctrine of the Lord. And this also was the vseof our Saviors own
miracles, John 10. 41, 42. John did no miracle, but all things that John spoke
of this man were true, and many believed in him there. What, did his miracles
work saving faith in them? No: this honor was ever peculiar to the Word,
Faith comes by hearing, Romans 10. 17. but they drew them to have a good opinion
of him, to be willing to hear him, that so they might be converted by him; to
begin to believe that he was indeed a Prophet sent of God: and so this their
believing in him is expounded in the beginning of Ver. 41. And many resorted to
him.

Three examples there be of those that received this good by them, but none
converted. The first is here in this place, compared with Matthew. 11. 20. Where
Christ vpbraideth these Galileans for this, that though they had seen so many
miracles, yet they repented not. The second example is John 2. 23. Many
believed in him, when they saw his miracles which he did: but lesus did not
commit himself to them, because he knew them all; he knew what was in them.
The last example is Nicodemus, Ioh. 3. 2. he alleges this to be the thing
that drew him to Christ, as to a Prophet sent of God: No man can do the
miracles that thou do, except God were with him; yet was he not converted by
these miracles, but by the Doctrine of Christ. And that is the reason, why our
Savior first preached the Word, and then wrought miracles; that it might
appear, the end why he wrought miracles, was to gain credit to his Doctrine.
Matthew 4. 23. He went about all Galile, teaching in their Synagogues, and
preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom, and healing every secknesse. And though
there be little mentioned of his preaching, before this his return into
Galile, yet it is evident by Nicodemus speech to him, that he preached while he
was at the Feast. Ioh. 3. 2. Rabbi, we know that thou art a Teacher come from
God.

The Reason why our Savior wrought miracles, to gain credit and authority to
his Doctrine (though he were able to preach with such power Reason.
and authority) was this; That his Doctrine was new, his calling and function
that he exercised in the Church was new. And the Lords manner has been
always, when he erected any new worship and service, or any new function or
calling in his Church, to give testimony to it from heaven this way, that it
might be known to be of God. Thus God gave testimony to the worship under the
Law. So soon as the Tabernacle was erected, Exodus 40. 34. The glory of the
Lord filled the Tabernacle. So when the Temple was finished, 1. Reg. 8. 11. The
glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord. And thus God gave testimony to
his new worship, established under the Gospel, Mark 16. 20. They went sorth,
and preached every where, and the Lord wrought with them, and confirmed the
Word with signs that followed. So when God has raised up a new calling and
function in his Church, he has been wont this way to give testimony unto it
from Heaven. Moses his calling was confirmed thus, Exodus 4. 5. and Eliah's, 1.
Reg. 17. 24. and though John wrought no miracles, Ioh. 10. 41. yet was his
calling confirmed by many miracles: first, he was borne of parents that were
both old, and his mother barren also, Luke 1. 7. 18. Secondly, his father was
made dumb for doubting of Gods promise, Luke 1. 22. Thirdly, he leaped in his
mothers womb for joy, as soon as his mother heard the voice of Mary's
salutation, Luke 1. 44. Fourthly, presently upon his birth his father was made
able to speak again, Luke 1. 64. Insomuch as, it is said, all the neighbors
gathered from all these things, that certainly he would prove some
extraordinary man, Verse. 66. All they that heard of them, laid them up in their
hearts, saying, what manner of Child shall this be? So the calling of the
Apostles, God did bear witness unto them with signs and wonders, and with
diverse miracles, Heb. 2. 4. So that of the Evangelists, The people gave ear
to those things that Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miracles that he did,
Acts 8. 6. So was the calling of all the Elders, whether teaching or ruling
only, confirmed. Is any man sick among you? let him call for the Elders of
the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of
the Lord; and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall
raise him up, Iam. 5. 14, 15. So Christ himself thought good to confirm his
new calling by miracles, and by this argument proves himself unto John's
Disciples to be the true Messiah, Mat. 11. 3. -- 5. and John 6. 14. When they
had seen the miracles that Jesus did, they said, This is of a truth the
Prophet that should come into the world.

The Use of this Doctrine is, first, for defense of our Church and Religion
against the Papists, who would from hence conclude, our Church and Use 1.
Religion must needs be false, because we have no miracles, and that theirs
must needs be true, because they have the gift of miracles. First, for our
selves we confess, that neither we have this gift, nor need it, (and
themselves grant, that miracles wrought there; where there is no necessity, are
to be suspected.) For neither our Doctrine, nor our Function, being any other,
than such as Christ and his Apostles did teach and ordain; they are by the
miracles that they wrought, sufficiently ratified and confirmed. For indeed, to
this end served the miracles of Christ and his Apostles, to be as seals to
confirm the Faith of Gods people in the Doctrine they taught, Many other
signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his Disciples, which are not written
in this book; But these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the
Christ the Son of God; and that believing, ye might have life through his
name, John 20. 30, 31. And seals they were, not such as are set in wax, the
stamp whereof might be worn out in time, and had need to be renewed; but such
as were engraven in brass, the stamp whereof may be as well seen now, as when
it was first done. All the miracles of Christ, and of the Prophets and
Apostles, are ours, as being done for the confirmation of that Doctrine, which
we teach and profess. And touching the miracles they brag of, we answer;
First, the most of the miracles they glory in, we have just cause to suspect,
that they were never done. The reports that are made of their miracles in the
golden Legend, all the world may discern to be notorious lies; many of them
also were but tricks of Legerdemaine; as the nodding, and weeping, and sweating
of their Images: whereas the miracles that Christ and his Apostles did, were
done before witnesses; not in the dark, and vnderboard; without all suspicion
of fraud, such as were evident to the senses of men: see what store of
witnesses he had of those miracles that are mentioned, Mat. 4. 24, 25. Mark
33. Yea where he did most affect secrecy, yet would he have some witnesses of
unsuspected credit; as in the raising of Iairus daughter, though he put forth
the most that were in the house, and commanded that this miracle might not be
spoken of, yet would he have three of his Apostles, and Iairus himself, and
his wife to be eyewitnesses of the miracle, Luke 8. 51, 56. So as his miracles
had testimony, not only from all the people, John 6. 14. but even from his
most mortal enemies, This man does many miracles, say they, John 11. 47.
Secondly, those things that can be proved to have been done indeed, are no
greater, than such as false teachers have been able to do: that is, such
things as have been so wonderful and strange, as they have seemed miracles
unto men, and which few or none have been able to distinguish from true
miracles; so our Savior says of false Prophets, They shall show great signs
and wonders, insomuch that (if it were possible) they shall deceive the very
elect, Matthew. ^4. ^4. Yea such, as is expressly foretold, should be done by
Antichrist and his Church, His coming is after the working of Satan, with all
power, and signs, and lying wonders, 2. These. 2. 9. And he does great wonders,
so that he makes fire come down from heaven in the sight of men. And
deceives them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he
had power to do, Ren. 13. 13, 14. Thirdly, we are sure they can be no true
miracles that they work, when the Doctrine they would confirm by them is
false, and contrary to the Word. For seeing, that things which may seem to be
miracles (in the judgment of the wisest man on earth) may be wrought by false
teachers, we must judge, not by the miracles, what Doctrine is true, but by the
Doctrine, what miracles are true and divine, If there arise among you a
Prophet, and gives thee a sign, or a wonder; and the sign or the wonder come
to pass whereof he spoke unto thee, saying: Let us go after other gods, and
serve them; thou shall not hearken to the words of that Prophet, Deuteronomy. 13. 1,
-- 3.

2 Seeing all Christ's wonderful works were done, to gain credit and
estimation to his Doctrine and Worship, let us make the same Use also of all
Gods wonderful works, that are done in our eyes; for they also are done to
that end, to draw us to a greater reverence, and better regard of his Word and
Worship* All his wonderful and strange judgments and corrections, wherein we
are constrained to acknowledge his finger, these things are done to open the
ears of men (to make them able to hear with more reverence and fruit) and to
seal their instruction, to confirm unto them, and make them better able to
believe that which they are taught by the Word, as Elibu speaks, Ioh 33. 16.
all the strange thunders and lightenings, etc. that we have seen and heard,
are done to that end: as is plain, Psalm. 29. 2, 3, 9. When the Prophet, to
persuade the greatest men on earth, to give unto the Lord the glory due unto
his Name, by frequenting with all reverence his public worship, and attending
upon his ordinances, mentions in many verses together the glorious power of
God which appears in the thunder, which he calls there the voice of the Lord;
and concludes all that he said of it thus, Verse. 9. And in his temple does
every one speak of his glory, even this mighty and dreadful work of God,
makes every man give glory to God in his Temple, and perform all duties of his
worship more diligently and reverently.

Lecture the eighty two. February 26. 1610. JOHN IIII. XLV.
WE heard the last day, that this Verse does offer to our consideration three
principal points: First, the readiness of the Galileans to entertain Christ
and his Ministry, in these words, Then when he came into Galile, the Galileans
received him. Secondly, the reason that moved them with so great readiness to
receive and entertain him, in these words, Which had seen all things that he
did at Jerusalem, at the Feast. Thirdly, the occasion whereby they came to see
all those things, that he did at Jerusalem, at the Feast, in these words, For
they went also unto the Feast. The two first points we finished the last day,
and now it remains that we proceed unto the last: where, for the raising of
the Doctrine that we are to receive from hence, three things are to be
observed: First, what this Feast was that the Galileans went unto; and that is
evident, (John 2. 23.) that it was the Passover. And the Passover is called a
Feast, because (beside the Paschall Lamb, which was then to be eaten by every
family) the people of God were wont then, for seven days to eat and drink
together with joy. This you shall see in the Passover kept in Hezekiahs time,
2 Chronicles. 30. 21. Two thousand bullocks, and seventeen thousand sheep were
spent at that Feast, Verse 24. And in that Josiah celebrated, 2 Chronicles. 35. 7,
8, 9. seven and thirty thousand sheep, lambs and kids, and three thousand eight
hundred bullocks were spent. Secondly, the use and end of this Feast; for it
was no civil or common Feast, but holy and religious, Leuit. 23. 6. it was
called the Feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord: that is, it was kept to his
honor and service. They went not thither, to make merry in a carnal manner,
but to rejoice before the Lord, Deuteronomy. 12. 12. that is, with an heavenly and
spiritual joy. They did not seek in that Feast the feeding of their bodies so
much, as the nourishment and comfort of their souls: therefore these sheep and
bullocks, that were given by Hezekiah and the Princes, are said to have been
given for peace offerings, 2 Chronicles. 30. 22. which were a kind of Sacramental
food, to the people that did eat of them. Therefore they were commanded to
have both on the first day of the Feast, and on the last day also, an holy
assembly, Exodus 12. 16. And we shall find, that Gods people then, had no
ordinary Church-assembly, that was so public and solemn as the Passover:
yea, not so only, but they were enjoined (besides the ordinary morning and
evening sacrifice) to offer sacrifices unto the Lord, upon every one of those
seven days, Numb. 28. 23, 24. whereby also it appears, that it was a
chargeable service that God required of them. And yet this is more plain by
that that is written, Deuteronomy. 16. 16, 17. where they are charged, that no man
come to this Feast empty-handed, without bringing somewhat with him, to give
and offer unto the Lord. The third and last thing to be observed, is, that the
Galileans used to go to this holy Feast; first, though it were so chargeable:
secondly, though it were kept at Jerusalem, so far from them: thirdly, though
they had also Church Assemblies to go unto in their Synagogues at home, every
Sabbath day; as it is plain, Luke 4. 16. 31. fourthly, though at this time,
both the Priests that were to celebrate the Passover, were very corrupt, ever
mortal enemies to Christ, Matthew. 21. 45, 46. and the Temple it self also was
greatly polluted, and made even a den of thieues, Matthew. 21. 13. fifthly and
lastly, though these Galileans were a rude and base people, and in that respect
contemptible to those Jews, whom they should meet at Jerusalem. John 7. 52.
Art thou also of Galile? search and look, for out of Galile arises no
Prophet: yet they went also unto the Feast, and the Holy Ghost commends them
here for it.

The Doctrine then that arises from this example, is this, That the public
Doct. 5.
and most solemn Church Assemblies are greatly to be esteemed, and diligently
to be frequented by all Gods people. Now because the proof that my Text
yields to this Doctrine, is taken from example, I will insist only upon this
kind of proof; because as we naturally use to regard examples more than
precepts, so the examples of Gods people, commended by the Holy Ghost, are
every whit of as great force, as any Commandement^s, Proverbs 2. 20. Walk in
the way of good men, and keep the way of the righteous. See therefore the
proof of this in three sorts of examples.

First, such as have been poor, and in that respect might best have been
excused. Luke 2. 41. The parents of Christ (though they were poor, and dwelt
far from Jerusalem, and the one of them not bound by express Law to do it,
yet) went every year to Jerusalem to the Passover, the most solemn
Church-assembly that Gods people had in those days. Behold, a witness against
them, that pretend poverty for their excuse in this case.

Secondly, in such as have been men of the greatest measure of knowledge and
grace, and (in that respect) one would have thought, had had no need to have
gone to them, but might have served God as well at home. And here we have the
example both of the Apostles after Christ's ascension, Luke 24. 53. who were
continually in the Temple; and of the Primitive Church, Acts 2. 46. who
continued daily with one accord in the Temple. And of our blessed Savior
himself, whose custom was to go to the Synagogue every Sabbath day, Luke 4.
16. and who did constantly go to Jerusalem to every Passover, John 2. 13. And
here are witnesses against them that pretend they have no need, they can get no
good by going to them.

Thirdly, such as were great persons; and therefore might have disdained to
sort themselves, and join with the base multitude in Gods service.

And here we have both Hezekiah the King, who resolved so soon as ever he
was recovered, to go up to the house of the Lord, Esaias 38. 22. and specially
David, Psalm 26. 8. O Lord, I have loved the habitation of thine house, and
the place where thine honor dwells. And Psalm. 84. 12. O Lord of hosts, how
amiable are thy Tabernacles, my soul longs, yea, and faints for the Courts
of the Lord. And these are witnesses against them, who (out of affectation of
state) use to have the Communion in their houses, and think it a disparagement,
to join with the base multitude in the service of God.

The Reasons why the Church Assemblies are so much to be regarded, are four.

1 In respect of the exercises of Religion that are used in them, I mean,
Reas. 1.
the Ministry of the Word and Sacraments, the prayers and praises that are
offered up unto God; for in them Gods people find more sweetness than in any
thing in the world besides. Of this the Prophet speaks, Esaias 25. 6. In this
mountain shall the Lord of hosts make to all people a feast of fat things, a
feast of fined wines, of fat things full of marrow, of wines fined and
purified. Indeed, every man cannot find such sweetness in these things; he is
a happy man that can savor and relish these dainties: but so those whom I have
mentioned, did; and every one that is regenerate, is able to do so in some
measure, Psalm. 65. 4. Blessed is the man, whom thou choosest, and causest to
come to thee, he shall dwell in thy courts, and we shall be satisfied with the
pleasures of thine house, even of thine holy Temple.

2 In respect of the fellowship and presence of Gods people, that assemble
there; for as every godly man loves all such as fear God, (Psalm 15. 4. and
delights in their company, Psalm 119. 63. I am a companion to all them that
fear thee, and keep thy precepts:) so does he take most comfort in their
company, when they meet together in the Church assemblies to serve God. It
shall be a great part of our happiness in the life to come, to meet together
with all the faithful, and to stand in the assembly of the righteous; as may
appear by that obtestation of the Apostle, We beseech you brethren by the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, 2
Thessal. 2. 1. and by that speech also of the Prophet, Sinners shall not stand
in the congregation of the righteous, Psalm 1. 5. And some resemblance and
taste of that comfort we have in our meeting together with Gods people in the
Church Assemblies here, Hebr. 10. 25. Not forsaking the assembling together
that we have among our selves. For there is great force even in the presence
and fellowship of Gods people, both to confirm, and nourish, and increase
grace in us, As iron sharpneth iron; so a man sharpneth the countenance of his
friend, Pro. 27. 17. And when the brethren met Paul at Appij Forum, he praised
God, and took courage; it was a great comfort and reviving of his spirit to
meet with them, Act. 28. 15. First, because of the help we receive by their
example, and the grace that is in them, which seems to be the cause of the
meeting together unto prayer of those good women we read of, Acts 16. 13. As a
little spark will keep heat, while it is on the hearth with the rest of the
fire; but pluck it from the rest, and it will die straight: so has experience
proved it to be in this case. Secondly, because they know, that the more of
Gods people meet and join together, the more public and solemn the assembly
is, the more acceptable will their service be unto God, and the more available
to their comfort. And that is the reason why, when Gods people have showed more
than ordinary desire, to prevail with God in prayer; they have showed more
than ordinary care, to assemble as many of them together, as possibly they
could, Joel 2. 15, 16. Blow a trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn
assembly, gather the Elders, assemble the children, let the Bridegroom go
sorth of his chamber, and the Bride out of her Bride-chamber: as if he should
say, Leave none out. That was the reason why Hezekiah was so careful to gather
together such a solemn assembly to the Passover, 2 Chronicles. 30. 1. -- 5.

3 The third reason is, the promise that God has made of his special, first,
Presence: secondly, Protection: and thirdly, Blessing, to the public
assemblies, more than to any other people upon the earth. First, in respect of
this special presence of God, the Prophet calls Sion the habitation of Gods
house, and the place where his honor dwells, Psalm 26. 8. In this respect
also the place of Gods public Worship is called the face of God. Psalm 105.
4. Seek the Lord and his strength, seek his face continually. And Cain could
complain (when he was banished from his fathers house, the only place where
Gods public Worship was to be had then) that he should be hid from Gods
face, Genes. 4. 14. and Verse 16. He ^t out from the presence of the Lord. And
least we should think, this w^ peculiar to the Temple, or Tabernacle, or place
of Gods ceremonial or ship (which had indeed some privileges above our
Temples) you shall find, that this is spoken also of the Synagogues: Psalm 83.
12. They also are called the Habitations of God. Yea, to our assemblies also is
this promise made as well as to theirs. Matthew 18. 20. Where two or three are
gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midst of them. Revelation 2. 1.
Christ walks in the midst of the seven golden Candlestickes. Secondly, Now for
the promise of special protection, it is certain, that the Church Assemblies
(where God is purely worshipped according to his Word) are means to preserve
such as do frequent them, and the places where they are kept, from many
judgments, that would otherwise fall upon them. This was figured by that
Ceremony, The walls of the Temple were carved round about with figures of
Cherubins, 1 Kings 6. 29. And this we have partly found in our own experience;
both in the preservation of our Land in general, from foreign invasion, and
domestique treasons; and in the safety sundry Congregations have enjoyed. And
we should certainly find it more than we do, if our infidelity, and other our
grievous sins hindered it not. See the promise for this, Esaias 33. 20, 21.
Look upon Sion, the City of our solemn Feasts; thine eyes shall see
Jerusalem, a quiet habitation, a Tabernacle that cannot be removed, and the
stakes thereof can never be taken away, neither shall any of the cords thereof
be broken; for surely the mighty Lord will be unto us a place of floods, and
broad rivers, whereby shall pass no ship with oars, neither shall great ship
pass thereby. This is alleged for one reason, why David did so esteem of
Gods Tabernacles, Psalm 84. 11. For the Lord God is the sun and shield unto
us. and 27. 5. For in time of trouble he shall hide us in his pauilion. In this
respect they that are separated from the Church Assemblies, are said to be
delivered up to Satan, unto his power and will, as men that are under Gods
protection no longer, 1 Corinthians. 5. 5. Thirdly and lastly, in speaking of the
Promise of a special blessing, that God has made unto the Church Assemblies;
I will not stand upon the temporal blessings that God has promised to such as
do love and frequent them; (which, yet David makes one reason of his love to
Gods Tabernacles, Psalm 84. 11. No good thing will he withold from them that
walk uprightly. And certainly, if men with upright hearts do frequent them,
they shall be sure of Gods blessing in outward things, even the rather for
this.) But this is the special blessing I will desire you to observe, That God
has promised to give a greater blessing to that service that is done to him at
Church, than to that that is done in any other place. The same Prayers you may
use at home that are used there, the same Psalms you may sing, the same Word
you may read, and meditate of, and have it also expounded to you; yea the same
Sacraments you may have (upon necessity) administered to you in your chambers
and parlours, that are administered there: but you may not expect that blessing
upon any of these Ordinances of God in any place, as you may find in the
Church assemblies. This David alleges for another chief reason, why he so
esteemed Gods Tabernacles. Psalm 84. 11. The Lord will give grace and glory.
And 133. 3. For there (in Sion, orin the place where Brethren dwell even
together; join together in Gods worship) The Lord appointed the blessing, and
life for ever.

The fourth and last Reason that should move us to esteem the
Church Assemblies, and frequent them diligently, is, for profession sake. Say
that neither the exercises of Religion that are used there, nor the
fellowshippe of Gods people which we may enjoy there, nor the special
presence, protection, and blessing of God that may be found there, could move
us to esteem of them; yet this should move us. The best way we have to
profess our Religion, our Homage, and Obedience to God, our love and
thankfulness to him for his mercies, is, to frequent diligently the public
and most solemn Assemblies of his Church. So the Lord, having (in the former
Verse) forbidden his People the profession of a false religion, Leuit. 26. 2.
prescribes them two things, whereby they should profess themselves to be of
the true Religion, Ye shall keep^ ^y Sabbaths, and reverence my Sanctuary. And
Psalm. 29. 1, (...). exhorting great men to profess their homage and subjection
unto the Lord, he tells them this is the best way to do it. And speaking how
he himself will profess his thankfulness to God for all his mercies, he
says, Psalm. 35. 18. I will give thanks to thee in a great Congregation; I
will praise thee among much people.

The use of this Doctrine is, first, for exhortation: secondly, for reproof.
And the exhortation concerns, first, our selves: secondly, a duty that we
must perform unto others.

First, for our selves: We are to be exhorted that we would love
Churchmeetings, and delight more in them, and be more thankful to God for
them, Use.
than we have hitherto been; Labor for that affection that David had, Psalm.
122. 1. I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go unto the house of the
Lord. Yea, pray for the continuance of our solemn Assemblies, both here and in
other places of the Country. This was also David's heart, Psalm. 122. 6. Pray
for the peace of Jerusalem, they shall prosper that love thee. And mark the
Reasons, Verse. 8, 9. For my brethren and Companions sakes I will now say, Peace
be within thee. Because of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek thy good.
And therefore labor to walk worthy of this blessing, and to profit by it. For,
no enemy can put down our meetings, till God for our sins do put them down.
Lam. 2. 6. He has destroyed his Tabernacle as a garden, he has destroyed his
Congregation.

Secondly, concerning others, there are two duties we are to be exhorted unto:
1. That every one of you would call upon his Neighbor and Friend, and draw
them to frequent the Church Assemblies. When the Lord had prophesied, Esaias 2.
2. that under the days of the Gospel, All nations should flow unto the house
of the Lord; he adds, Verse. 3. that this should be the mean to draw so many
to his house, Many people shall go, and say, Come, let us go up to the house of
the Lord. 2. Masters of Families and Parents are to be exhorted, that they
would not think it sufficient to come to Church themselves, but see that their
children and servants come also. We should suffer none to attend us in our own
house, that will not attend and go with us to Gods house. Exodus 20. 10. Son,
Daughter, Man, Maid, Stranger. Josh. 24. 15. I and my house will serve the
Lord. David speaks of this, as of one of the greatest comforts he had had
upon earth, Psalm. 42. 4. That he had gone with a multitude, and led them into
the house of God. and Psalm. 101. 7. There shall no deceitful person dwell in
mine house. Sure he would much more have said; there shall no profane
contemner of Religion dwell in my house.

The second use of the Doctrine is for reproof. And there be two sorts 2.
of men that are to be reproved by this Doctrine: 1. Such as neglect the
Church Assemblies in all the parts of Gods worship and se^uice. 2. Such as
separate themselves from the Church Assemblies in some parts of Gods public
worship.

Of the first kind there are four sorts: 1. Such as separate from our
Churchassemblies upon pretense of the corruptions that are in them. These are
marked with a black coal by Jude, verse. 19. These be they who separate
themselves, sensual, having not the spirit. But herein Christians must learn
wisely to distinguish between such as are unjustly separated by others from
the Church Assemblies, and such as voluntarily separate themselves; these
deserve to be called Schismatics, and not the other. Neither are they to be
accounted Schismatics, as (though they dare not be agents, or practisers of
any corruption that remains in the Church; yet) can bear and tolerate them
as burdens, without forsaking the Church for them. To this first sort I will
say no more, but wish them well to weigh the examples of Gods servants, that
have been mentioned in this doctrine, which frequented so diligently the
public worship of God used in Jerusalem, when there were far greater
corruptions, both in the Priests, and people, and worship it self, than can be
found in ours.

2 Such as absent themselves from the Church-meetings, out of respect they have
to their profit, they must needs spend some Sabbaths in going to Faires; they
must go iournies on that day sometimes, and make bargains, etc. they cannot
spare any time from the works of their calling, to come to Lectures on the week
day. They cannot get their living (they say) by going to Church; and when they
do come to Church on the Sabbath, they cannot bring their whole family with
them, they must leave some behind them, to look to their houses for fear of
robbing. These are like those, Mal. 3. 14 that said, It is i^ vain to serve
God, and what profit is it, that we have kept his ordinances? To these I say no
more but this: First, if thou could come to the Church, either on the
Sabbath or week day, with an upright heart, thou should not need to fear,
that that would make thee poorer, The Lord God would be a sun and shield unto
thee, no good thing would he withold from thee, Psalm 84. 11. Secondly,
though thou may (in sundry cases of necessity) leave some at home, when thou
come to Church, yet take heed thou pretend not necessity, where none is.
For, if thou dare leave thy house empty when thou go to a Fair, or to
harvest work, and can trust God with keeping of it then, and dare not do
so on the Sabbath, when thou come to serve God, be thou assured, thy heart
is naught, and God will not hold thee innocent: For, God has made a further
promise to thee for keeping of thine house, when thou leauest it upon this
occasion, than at any other time: Neither shall any man desire thy land, when
thou shall go to appear before the Lord thy God thrice in a year, Exodus 34.
24.

3 Such as though they have nothing to do, if their finger be sore, or their
head do butake, will absent themselves: I would have such to remember the
example of Hezechiah, who in three days after he had been sick of a most
painful and mortal disease, went into the Temple, Esa. 38. 22. and the woman,
that on the Sabbath resorted to the Synagogue, though she had had a spirit of
infirmity eighteen years, Luke 13. 10, 11. And because the true cause of
their absence, is for that they find no comfort, nor take any delight in our
Church-exercises; I would have them to consider, that there is no one more
certain sign of a dead heart, void of all grace, and sense of Gods love, than
this, not to be able to take any delight in his public worship; as may appear
by the contrary in these two places, Psalm. 84. 12. David loved Gods Tabernacles
so well, because his heart, and his flesh rejoiced in the living God. And 1
Pet. 2. 2, 3. Such as have tasted how sweet the Lord is, will desire the
sincere milk of the Word. And know thou, that as thou carest not for appearing
in the Assemblies of the righteous in this life; so have thou cause to fear,
that thou shall not stand in the Assembly of the righteous in the life to come,
Psalm. 1. 5. when thou will esteem better of them, than now thou do.

4 Such as absent themselves upon this pretense, that they can serve God as
well, and spend their time as well at home, as at Church; they can pray, and
read good Books, out of which they may learn more then they shall do at
Church. But such I would have to consider, Psalm. 87. 2. The Lord loves the
gates of Sion, more than all the dwellings of Jacob. And the example of David,
who though he could serve God as well in private as any of these, and had also
with him (in his banishment) both a Prophet, 1 Samuel 22. 5. and a Priest, 1 Samuel
23. 9. yet did he for all that, long for the public worship, and bewailed
greatly the want of it, Psalm. 84. 1. -- 3.

Of those that though they do not absent themselves from the Church, as the
four sorts I have mentioned; yet do separate themselves from the
Church Assemblies in some parts of the public worship: Three sorts specially
are reproved by this doctrine.

1 They that seldom or never receive the Sacrament, which is (of all other)
the most solemn part of Gods public worship; and in frequenting whereof, all
the faithful, both under the Law and Gospel, have showed most zeal, as in
this Text, and the other Examples mentioned in this doctrine we have showed.

2 They that care not to come to the beginning of Gods public worship, and to
tarry till the end.

3 Such as being present, either sit as dumb persons, when the Congregation
sings, or are down on their knees at their private prayers, when the rest of
the Congregation are hearing Gods Word; or by their sitting (when the rest of
the Congregation kneeleth, or stands at prayer) do openly profess a
separation from the Congregation in that duty.

THE EIGHTY THIRD LECTVRE, ON MARCH V. MDCX.
JOHN IIII. XLVI, XLVII. So Jesus came again into Cana of Galile, where he made
the water wine: And there was a certain noble man, whose son was sick at
Capernaum.

When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galile, he went unto him,
and besought him, that he would come down and heal his son: for he was at
the point of death.


IN the three former Verses, we have heard of our Saviors return out of Judea
into Galile. In these that I have now read, is set down the first miracle that
he wrought there after his return. And in this History four principal things
are to be observed: First, the occasion of the miracle, Verse 46, 47. Secondly,
the manner how this miracle was wrought, Verse 48. -- 50. Thirdly, the fruit
and effect of this miracle, Verse 51. -- 53. Fourthly, the conclusion of the
History, Verse 54. In the occasion of the miracle, which is set down in the
two first Verses, three things are observed by the Evangelist: First, that
Christ came into Cana, Verse 46. Secondly, that a certain Ruler had his son
sick at Capernaum, Verse 46. yea so sick, that he was even ready to die, Verse
47. Thirdly, that this Ruler, hearing of Christ's return out of Judea into
Galile, came to him to Cana and besought him to go down to Capernaum to heal
his son, Verse 47.

Now for the first, many Interpreters have coniectured, that the reason why
Christ returning into Galile, went first to Cana, was this, That he might
confirm them of Cana in the Faith, that was begun in them, by the miracle he
had wrought there at the wedding; because in this place that miracle is
mentioned. But there is no good ground for that conjecture: for first, we
cannot find that any in Cana received good by that miracle, but the contrary
rather. John 2. 11. This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana, a town of
Galile, and showed forth his glory, and his Disciples believed in him:
intimating, that none else did so. Secondly, the reason of his coming to Cana
now, might well be this; that coming out of Judea into Galile, through
Samaria, and of purpose leaving Nazaret, Cana was the next town in his way, as
will appear to any that shall look in the Mapp of Judea. Thirdly, the reason
why the miracle is here mentioned, might well be this, to distinguish it from
another town of that name, which was also in Galile, in the tribe of Asher,
upon the coasts of Tire and Sidon, of which we read, Josh. 19. 28. and where
the faithful Cananite, of whom we read, Matthew. 15. 22. did dwell. But why then
(will you say) is his coming into Galile mentioned here by the Evangelist?
Surely, to declare the occasion that was offered unto Christ of doing this
miracle. So soon as ever he was come into Galile, while he was at Cana, the
first town that he abode in, the Ruler dwelling at Capernaum (which was about
fifteen of our miles from Cana) hearing of his being there, came unto him. And
this is the first thing that is observed in the occasion of the miracle, which
we will thus pass over.

The second is, that a certain Ruler had his son sick at Capernaum. He is
called in the original, not (...) (as the vulgar Latin that translateth it
regulus, a petty King, seems to have read it) but (...), one belonging to the
King. To what King, will you say? Surely, not to Caesar, of whom the high
Priests said, John 19. 15. We have no King but Caesar: for the officers that
Caesar appointed to govern under him, were usually Gentiles; but this was a
Jew, as appears by Christ's speech to him, Uerse 48. He was then an officer to
Herod.

Object. Why but that Herod that lived now, Herod Antipas (son to Herod the
first, that lived when Christ was borne) was no King; for after the death of
Herod the Great, the Emperor, to prevent rebellion, divided the Kingdom of
Herod into four parts, between the three sons that Herod had left: and gave
two parts to Archelaus his eldest son, and the other two to Philip and Herod,
two of his younger sons. Herod's part was Galile; and he is therefore called
Tetrarch of Galile, Luke 3. 1. that is, one that had the government of a fourth
part of the Kingdom; namely, of Galile.

Answ. The answer is, that though he were but Tetrarch, yet both the people
generally that were under his government, did call him King, and in Galile he
did rule as a King, and his authority was every whit as great, as his fathers
had been. And therefore also the Evangelist Matthew, that Chap. 14. 1. calls
him Herod the Tetrarch, Uers. 9. calls him King.

Well then, this Ruler, this (...), was an officer of King Herod, yea, as the
Syriacke (which is the most ancient translation of the new Testament) has it,
he was the Kings Deputy, one that ruled the Country under the King, or in the
Kings absence. A great man he was, as may further also appear, by the great
family he kept, Verse 53. and by this, that sundry of his servants came forth
to meet him, to bring him tidings of his sons recovery, Verse 51. yet this
great man has his son sick, yea sick unto death, which (to such a man as he
was) is a greater cross, than the loss of many children to a meaner man. And
it well appears indeed in the Text, that he was greatly afflicted with it.
The Doctrine then we learn here is this, That no man's Doct. 1.
wealth or greatness in the world can free him from affliction. This Rulers
wealth, nor his authority and honor in the Country, nor his favor with the
King, could keep off Gods hand, either from his child, or from his own heart,
but his child is sick of a painful and mortal disease, and himself is
maruellously troubled and afflicted with it. Though men that are rich, and of
great estate in the world, have more means to keep themselves from many
afflictions than others have, and from the sense of those afflictions which are
upon them; yet can they not be exempted from Gods judgments. No doubt, this
Rulers child wanted no attendance, no good diet, no advice and help of the
Physician; and yet will not all serve the turn, but he is sick unto death. And
the Ruler himself wanted no means to put grief from his heart; company,
pleasures, recreations, etc. yet is he as deeply wounded with this affliction,
as another man. This is that that Solomon says, Riches avail not in the day
of wrath, Pro. ^1. 4. They cannot fence a man from Gods strokes: Yea, it is
certain, that oftentimes Gods plagues even in this world, light more heavily
and fearfully upon them, than upon other men, Psalm. 76. 12. He shall cut off
the spirit of Princes, he is terrible to the King: of the earth. And 82. 7. Ye
shall die like men, and fall like one of the Princes.

The Reasons of this are principally two: First, they are sinners as well as
Reas.
others, and sin will bring misery. Job 5. 7. Man is borne (says Eliphaz) to
misery and trouble, as the sparks fly upward: that is, ever since the fall,
it is as natural for man to have misery, as for the the sparks to fly
upward: yea, usually (unless Gods grace prevent them) they sin with an
higher hand, and with more pride than other men. That made the Prophet, Prou.
30. 9. pray for a mean estate, least (says he) I be full, and deny thee, and
say, Who is the Lord? And God delights to show his power in abasing proud
sinners. 1 Peter 5. 5. He resists the proud. Job 40. 6, 7. Cast abroad the
indignation of thy wrath, and behold every one that is proud, and abase him;
look on every one that is arrogant, and bring him low; as if he should say; I
do so. It is no marvel therefore though they be plagued above other men.

Secondly, they are usually exempted from the censures of men. The Laws of men
are like the Spiders webb, these great Flies will easily burst thorough them;
and as for the reproofs of Gods Word, they will not endure them. Ier. 5. 5.
These have altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds. And therefore it is
necessary, God should take them in hand. For so the Lord has said, when men,
whom he has given authority unto, to reprove and censure wicked men, either
dare not, or will not do it. When they hide their eyes and wink at him, then
will I (says the Lord) set my face against that man, and against his family,
and will cut him off, Leuit. 20. 4. 5.

The Use of this Doctrine is, first to warn us, that we suffer not any outward
Use.
privilege we have above others to puff up our hearts, and make us proud, 1 Timothy 6. 17. Charge them that are rich in this world that they be not
high-minded, and that they trust not in uncertain riches. Remember how God
hates pride. If he see thee proud, he can abase, yea he will abase thee one
way, or other. Think often of this, that he beholds every one that is
proud, and abaseth him, Job 4. 11. Remember an example of it, even in Hezekiah
who was the dear child of God; his heart was lifted up, therefore there was
wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem, 2. Chron. 32. 25. First, take
heed of being proud against any man, even the poorest and basest of thy
Neighbors to despise him, because thou art richer than he, better than he.
Pro. 17. 5. He that mocketh or despises a poor man, reproacheth him that made
him. Deuteronomy. 17. 20. Even the Kings heart must not be lifted up above his
Brethren. But 2. Specially take heed thy wealth, etc. make thee not proud
against God, to despise Religion, as it did Uzzia, 2. Chron. 26. 16. When he
was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction. Know thou, that
humility is that which seasoneth all religious duties, and makes them sauoury
to God. Micah 6. 8. He has showed thee, O man, what is good, and what the Lord
requires of thee: surely to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly
with thy God. As if he should have said; God and thou can never walk together,
never agree together, till thou have an humble heart. Know, there is as great
cause thou should fear God, and humble thy self before him, reverence
Religion, tremble at his Word, as the meanest man that lives upon the earth;
and thou can never show too much humility toward God. David may serve as a
notable example for this: when he had showed such zeal and joy in bringing
home, and dancing before the Arc, Michol his Wife, a profane Woman, when she
saw him, despised him in her heart. 2. Sam. 6. 16. (as every one that shall
show any zeal, devotion, or reverence to Religion now adays, shall be sure to
meet with many a Michol:) but what said David to her, 2. Sam. 6. 22. I will yet
be more vile than thus, and will be low in mine own sight. And of the very
same maide-seruants which thou have spoken of, shall I be had in honor.

The second Use, is, to exhort all to prepare for affliction, and to provide 2.
for comfort against the evil day, seeing no man may hope to be exempted from
it. Ephesians. 6. 13. Provide, that ye may be able to resist in the evil day.

To this end I will commend unto you three Rules: First, to meditate, 1.
and think often of, and look for the evil day; resolve with thy self thou
must not live always in peace, and health, and prosperity, but there will be a
change, there will come a time, when thou shall part with all thy dearest
comforts, there will come a time of trouble, sickness, adversity, if a man
live many years and rejoice in them all: yet let him remember the days of
darkness for they shall be many, Eccles. 11. 8. It was David's folly, which we
must all take heed of, and he complains of, Psalm. 30. 6. In my prosperity I
said, I shall never be moved. But it was his wisdom, which we must all strive
after, which he mentions, Psalm. 39. 4, 5. Lord, let me know mine end, and the
measure of my days what it is, Let me know how long I have to live: Behold,
thou have made my days as an hands breadth, and mine age is nothing in respect
of thee; surely every man in his best estate is altogether vanity. And to this
end it is profitable to observe, and think upon the afflictions of others.
Eccles. 7. 4. It is better to go into the house of mourning, than into the
house of feasting, because this is the end of all men, and the living shall lay
it to heart.

Object. And if any shall object, that this were the way to bring unnecessary
heaviness upon our own hearts; when affliction comes we shall have grief
enough, it were folly to hasten it, by thinking and musing of death or
sickness, or loss of our dearest friends aforehand. Matthew. 6. 34. Care not
for the morrow, for the day has enough with his own grief.

Answ. I answer, that it is folly indeed to care for to morrow, with
distrustful taking thought for the things of this life: but to think
aforehand of the evil day, and to provide for it, is not folly, but wisdom.
The heaviness that these thoughts bring upon the heart, is a wholesome and
profitable heaviness. Eccles. 5. 7. By the sadness of the countenance the
heart is made better. And, what hope is there, that they that put far from
them the evil day, Amos 6. 3. and cannot endure to hear, or think of it,
should be able with patience and comfort to bear it, when it shall come upon
them?

The second Rule is, to make our peace with God, and our accounts straight
between him and us before the evil day come: for then we shall be unfit 2.
to do it. Eccles. 12. 1. Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth,
before the evil days come, and the years approach, wherein then shall say, I
have no pleasure in them. If a man (says our Savior, Luke 14. 32.) have an
enem^e coming against him with greater power than he is able to resist, while
he is yet a great way off, he will send an embassage, and desire conditions of
peace Since we must look for a time, wherein the winds will blow, and floods
beat upon our house, it shall be our wisdom before hand to ground it upon
the Rock. Let us therefore now treasure up to our selves good grounds of
comfort against the evil day: for then we shall not be able for to do it;
that will be a time of spending the stock we have gotten, not of increasing
it. Pro. 0. 14. Wise men lay up knowledge. Give thy self much to prayer now;
for in extremity of affliction, thou will not be so well able to do it: of
that time it is that the Apostle speaks, we know not what we should pray for
as we ought, Romans 8. 26.

The third Rule is, to take heed of esteeming too highly, or ouerlouing any of
the comforts of this life. That that David says of riches, may be said of 3.
all other outward comforts. Psalm. 62. 10 Trust not in oppression, become not
vain through robbery; if riches increase, set not thine heart upon them. This
is an extreme vanity; for first, thou must part with them. secondly, the
nearer thou have set them to thine heart, the less comfort, and the more
bitterness shall thou find in parting with them. It is the Apostles
counsel, 1. Cor. 7. 29. Let them that have wives, be as though they had none,
and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not, and they that buy, as
though they possessed not, and they that use the world, as though they used it
not: and he gives two reasons: first, the fashion of this world goes away:
secondly, the time that remains, is short. Let us rather set our whole heart
upon those comforts that are durable. The Word of God, and the comforts that it
yields, are durable comforts, 1. Pet. 1. 24, 25. Luke 0. 42. Mary has chosen
the good part, that shall not be taken away from her. Oh, count it miserable
folly for thee, to have no other felicity but in this life, in eating, and
drinking, in playing, in sporting, etc.

Lecture the eighty four. March 12. 1610. JOHN IIII. XLVI, XLVII.
WE have heard the last day, that these verses contain in them the occasion,
that was ministered unto Christ, to work this first miracle; and that therein,
three things are to be observed: First, that the great man had a great cross:
Secondly, what his cross was: Thirdly, the benefit and profit he received by
his cross. The first of these three points we finished the last day; it
follows now, that we proceed to the two last. And let us now observe what
this cross was, His son was sick, yea even ready to dye: whether he had any
more than this or no, it is not expressed. But of this it is said, that he was
a young one; for verse 46. he calls him (...). Go down before my little boy
die. And see how this father was affected with this cross: First, though he
was a great man, he comes himself to fetch Christ: Secondly, and that so
soon as he was come into Galile: Thirdly, he humbly besought him, that he
would go down to him: Fourthly, see how it troubled him; when Christ seemed
to make some delay, verse 49. he makes no direct answer to Christ, nor seems
to regard what he says; all his mind was of his son: Sir, go down before
my little boy dye: Fifthly, see how thankful he was to God for restoring his
child, verse 53. In all these points, observe the abundance of tender
affection in this great man toward his child; and from hence learn this
Doctrine:

That great is the affection and love that parents do bear toward their
children. Loss of children went nearer the hearts of the Egyptians, than any
Doct. 2.
other plagues did, Exodus 11. 6.

This is so natural, and (as I may say) so inseparable a property of all
parents, that when Solomon would find out the true Mother, 1. Reg. 3. 25. he
sought to find her by this note; and so indeed he did: for the true Mother
(though she were an Harlot) yet chose rather to part with her child to her
adversary, than to see him divided, verse 26. Her compassion (says the Text)
was kindled toward her son, and she said, O my Lord, give her the living
child, and slay him not: but the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine,
but divide it. See this also in Hagar, Genesis 21. 16. she could not endure to see
her child dye.

But though this be natural, yet it is no part of the corruption of our
nature, but a remainder of that image of God, according to which we were first
created.

The holiest of Gods servants, have been most full of this natural affection.
Three only examples I will give you for this, though I might give you many
more. The first is of Abraham, who though he saw nothing in Ismael, that might
deserve it, though he were the son of the bondwoman; yet see his affection
toward him, when God had promised him a son by Sarah, and a most blessed
posterity, he bursteth out into this speech, Oh that Ismael might live in thy
sight: as if he should say, I love Ismael so well, that I care for no more,
Genesis 17. 18. yea afterward, when for mocking and persecuting Isaac, Sarah would
needs have him cast out the bondwoman and her son, it is said, Gen 21. 11.
This thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight (not because of Hagar, but)
because of his son. Before, when Sarah was offended with Hagar, he yielded to
her, Genesis 16. 6. Behold, thy Maid is in thine hand, do with her as pleases
thee. But now she will have him to cast out his son, This thing was very
grievous in Abraham's sight, because of his son. The second example is in
David, who though he had so much cause to have hated Absolon, a murderer of his
own brother, a rebel against his own father, a filthy and shameless defiler
of his own fathers bed, and that in the sight of all Israel: yet see the
affection that he bare unto him; the father loved, when the child hated. 2.
Sam. 18. 5. He gave Ioah, and Abishai, and Ittai, and all the Captains
straight charge, thus; Entreat the young man Absolon gently for my sake: yea,
he gave it so, as all the people might hear him; and when some came to him
with news, touching the success of the battle, the first question he asked
him was this, 2. Sam. 18. 22. Is the young man Absolon safe? And when he heard
he was slain, he could not contain, but (though he sought a secret place to
cry his fill in, yet) he could not hold till he came thither, but as he went,
burst out into this outcry, O my son Absolon, my son, my son Absolon,
would God I had dyed for thee, O Absolon, my son, my son, 2. Sam. 18. 33.
Though Absolon could forget David was his father, yet David could not forget
that Absolon was his son. The third example is of the Widow of Sarepta, 1.
Reg. 17. who, though first, she was a very poor woman, verse 10. Eliah found
her gathering sticks: secondly, though the time also was very hard, even a
great dearth, verse 7. thirdly, though she could not maintain her self nor
her son, without the Prophets miraculous help, verse 22. yet see how this
poor woman loved her child, what an affliction it was to her to part with
him: first, she kept him in her bosom a good while after he was dead, verse
19. secondly, she grew so impatient, and into such a passion, that she fell out
with the Prophet, and imputed the death of her child to him, Verse 18. What
have I to do with thee, O man of God, art thou come unto me to call my sin
to remembrance, and to slay my son? So that you see, though there be nothing
in children to deserve this, though there be never so much in children to
deserve the contrary, though the parents be so poor, as they have much ado to
maintain their children, yet will parents, godly parents, bear a tender and
dear affection unto them.

The time will not permit to give you a reason of this; and indeed, if it
would, yet were it folly in me, to go about to give a reason of this: for who
can give a reason of those Sympathies, and Antipathies that are in nature?

Let us therefore come to the Use of this Doctrine: Use. 1.


First, you that are children, and have parents living, learn from hence the
duty you owe to your parents: You can never match them in love, you can never
recompense their kindness; but yet strive to do it. 1. Tim. 5. 4. Let them
learn first to show godliness toward their own house, and to recompense
their parents. Take heed of giving them just cause of grief, Pro. 17. 25. A
foolish son is a grief to his father, and an heaviness unto her that bare
him. This is noted for one of Esau's chief sins; by matching wickedly, he
did that, that was a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebecca, Genesis 26. 35. But
specially, take heed thou despise them not, contemn them not: the Prophet
speaking, Pro. 30. 11. of four sorts of the vilest men, places these in the
first rank. Pro. 20. 20. He that curses (speaks evil of) his father or his
mother, his light shall be put out in obscure darkness. Though the Magistrate
punish them not so, God will. Men should remember the example of Cham, and take
heed how they delight to see, or speak of the infirmities and faults of their
parents, Genesis 9. 22. 25.

Secondly, you that are parents, and have children, learn your duties 2.
here: First, to show natural affection to them, else art thou a beast, rather
than a man or woman. It is made a note of a man, whom God has given up to a
reprobate mind, to be without natural affection, Romans 1. 30. And Job notes it
for a property of a most wicked man, that so he may enjoy wealth and pleasure
while he lives, he cares not what becomes of his house and children after
him. Job 21. 21. What pleasure has he in his house after him, when the number
of his own months is cut off? And the Apostle says, 1. Tim. 5. 8. He has
denied the faith, and is worse than an Infidel, that prouides not for his own
house. Let all Unthrifts and Belly-gods think of these things.

Secondly, since it is so easy to exceed in natural affection, seek to
moderate it by knowledge and religion. It is no singular thing to love thy
children; the Harlot did so, 1. Reg. 3. 26. but take heed of ouer-louing them,
of loving them more than God; as they do, first, that love their children so,
as that they love also their faults, rejoice to hear them curse, or do
unhappily: secondly, that will not have them crossed in any thing, or
corrected: thirdly, that for love to their children, will shrink from Gods
truth, or otherwise offend God; as Eli did, 1. Sam. 12. 29. Be sure God will
plague thee by thy children, if thou dote upon them, and love them too much.
Prou. 29. 15. A child set at liberty, makes his mother ashamed, and his
father too. Know the chief thing thou should show thy love to thy child
in, is in loving his soul, Ephesians. 6. 4. If thou love thy children, fear God,
that is the only sure way to do them good, the generation of the upright shall
be blessed, Psalm. 112. 2. take heed of those sins that will bring Gods curse
upon them: oppression will do it, this is the heritage of the oppressors
which they shall receive from the Almighty; if his children be multiplied it is
for the sword; and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread, Job 27.
13, 14. whoredom will do it, it is a fire that consumes unto destruction and
would root out all mine increase, Job 31. 12. contempt and hatred of Religion
will do it, as is plain by the reason God gives of the second commandment
which concerns his outward worship, I will visit the iniquity of the fathers
upon the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,
Exodus 20. 5. generally, all wickedness will do it, Cursed shall be the fruit
of thy body, Deuteronomy. 18. 18.

Thirdly, let us all learn by this, what a happy thing it is to have God for
our Father: If we that are evil, Matthew. 7. 11. when our child asks us 3.
bread, will not give him a stone; if we when he asks fish, will not give him
a serpent: if we, Mal. 3. 17. do so spare them: if we, Esaias 49. 15. cannot
forget them: if we be so apt to receive our child, how hainously soever he
has offended us, upon his submission, how much more will the Lord receive us?
Luke 15. 20. If we show our affection most, when our children are in extremity,
how much more will the Lord? his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel,
Judge. 10 16. If we take no pleasure in beating our children, how much less the
Lord, he does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men, Lam. 3. 33.

Lecture the eighty five. March 19. 1610. JOHN IIII. XLVII.
NOw it remains that we proceed unto the third and last point, which we
observed in these words; namely, the benefit that this great man received by
his affliction. Concerning which, these three points are to be observed: First,
it humbled him greatly, and abated his pride; for (as great a man as he was,
yet) he himself seeks help for his son: and 2. he meekely and patiently
bare a very sharp check that Christ gave unto him, verse 48 without ever
replying or expostulating the matter with him. Secondly, it did drive him to
seek to Christ; yea, to seek earnestly and importunately for help.
Doubtless, first, he had heard much of Christ before this time, and did also
esteem him a great Prophet; but whether it were for fear of Herod, or some
other carnal respect, he came not unto him, till this affliction did drive him
unto him: secondly, he had also used the benefit of physic, and all other
ordinary means before; and till that he sees no means would prevail, but
his son grew into extremity, and was even ready to dye, he comes not to
Christ.

Thirdly, this affliction became unto him a mean and occasion of his unfeigned
conversion; for first, it softened his heart, and prepared it to believe the
word of Christ: secondly, it brought both himself, and his whole family to the
Faith.

The Doctrine then we have here to learn, is this: That affliction is greatly
Doct. 3.
profitable and necessary unto all the Elect of God.

Mark, that I say, unto the Elect of God; for affliction in it self is a
curse of God, and fruit of his wrath due to sin: whether we be afflicted in
our bodies, or in our minds, or in our children, or in our goods, or in our
good name; there is no affliction of what kind soever, but it is in it own
nature a curse of God, the Lord makes this preface to all the particular evils
and afflictions that he threatens, If thou will not hearken to the voice of
the Lord thy God, then all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee,
Deuteronomy. 28. 15. And daily experience teaches us, afflictions are not profitable
to all men. Pharaoh had afflictions enough, but still his heart was harder and
harder. Of all the afflictions of the Reprobate, we may say, as our Savior
speaks in another case, Matthew. 24. 8. All these are but the beginnings of
sorrows. The losses and afflictions, the pains and sorrows they feel in
this life, are but as earnests of those unspeakable and everlasting torments,
that are prepared for them in the life to come. This that I speak of
therefore, that men should receive so great good by affliction, is a privilege
peculiar to the Elect of God. Romans 8. 28. All things (and he speaks
specially of afflictions) work together for the best to them that love God,
even to them that are called according to his purpose. To them all things are
sanctified, all things are made good; even those things that in themselves are
most evil. 1. Cor. 3. 21, 22. All things are yours, whether it be this world,
or life, or death, or things present, or things to come, all are yours, and ye
are Christ's. The Cross of Christ (like unto the Tree that God showed Moses,
Exodus 15. 25.) has made affliction (which was before as the waters of Mara,
bitter and unwholesome) to be sweet and wholesome to all his people.

To all such (I say) affliction is both profitable and necessary. For the
profit of them, you know what David said. He had afflictions of all kinds and
of them all he says, Psalm. 119. 71. It is good for me, that I have been
afflicted. And the Church, Lam. 3. 27. speaks more generally, It is good for
a man that he hear the yoke in his youth. But I say not only they are
profitable, but they are necessary also; as necessary as meat and drink.
Unless God would see us perish, he must needs afflict us: yea, the best man
that ever was, has had great need of it to his dying day. Psalm 73. 14. Daily
have I been punished, and chastened every morning. Acts 14. 22. We must
through many afflictions enter into the Kingdom of God, or we can never come
there. That is the reason of that strange and passionate speech the Lord uses
of his people, Ier. 9. 7. Behold, I will melt them and try them: for what
should I else do for the Daughter of my People? As if he should say, I can
devise no way to do them good, but by casting them into the furnace of
affliction.

Reasons of this Doctrine I might give many: but I will content my Reason.
self with those few that the Text affords me in the example of this Ruler.

First, his affliction (as I showed you) did humble him. This is the first
Reason why it is so profitable and necessary, because it humbles the heart of
man, and abateth his pride. There is no one sin (we know) that makes a man
more odious to God, or that is a greater bar to our salvation than pride is.
Prou. 16. 5. All that are proud in heart, are abomination to the Lord. James 4.
6. The Scripture offers more grace: and therefore says, God resists the
proud, and gives grace to the humble. Neither is there any man, high or low,
rich or poor, godly or ungodly, but he has in him that old leaven that Paul
speaks of, 1. Cor. 5. 7. which puffs up his heart, and causes him to
swell, and to think too well of himself. All the oppression and cruelty that
the Mighty practice upon their inferiors, proceeds from this root. Psalm.
119. 122. Let not the proud oppress me: and so does the malice and
unreconcilable heart that is in men, Pro. 13. 10. Only by pride does man make
contention. From hence it comes, that men show such contempt to the Word,
that every mean man scorneth to be admonished, and reproved by it. Ior. 13.
15. Heat and give ear, be not proud: for the Lord has spoken it. Yea, the
best of Gods children are extremely prone to this sin, to think too well of
themselves, if they enjoy prosperity but a while. When other sins decay in us,
this grows and increases: and a man will be proud of grace, nay, proud even
of this, because he is more humble than other men. It is said of good Hezekiah,
2. Chron. 32. 25. that when (upon his repentance and humbling himself) God had
restored him, and added fifteen years to his life, that his heart was lifted
up. Many think they have no great need of affliction for this; they are not
proud, because they are not curious in apparel, nor of their bodies. But
alas, that is but one fruit of pride; a man may be a proud man, though he be a
very slouen this way. Now affliction will humble a man, and abate this pride of
heart; and nothing but affliction will do it. Elihu noted this to be one end
that God aymeth at in correcting man, Job 33. 17. That he might hide the pride
of man. For the pride we have in our beauty, and strength of our body, a little
sickness will abate it, and cause us to acknowledge it to be indeed as the
Apostle calls it, Phil. 3. 21. Avile body, unworthy of the cost, and care,
and time, that we have bestowed upon it. And what end would there be of this
vanity, if God should not now and then visit his Children with some correction
or other? But let us consider more distinctly the benefit and fruit of
affliction this way.

1. It abateth the pride that is in man toward man. It daunteth the spirit of
the proudest and cruellest oppressor; as we shall see in Job 31. 13, 14. If I
did contemn the judgment of my Man-seruant, or of my Maid, when they did
contend with me, what then shall I do when God stands up? and when he shall
visit me, what shall I answer? David in his prosperity, cared not what wrong
he did to his faithful servant, and dear friend Uriah: but in his
adversity, he durst not do the least harm to his mortal enemy, he durst
not put forth his hand against Saul, 1. Sam. 24. 10. Ye have seldom seen any
that had any mind to wrong others, when Gods hand has been heavy upon them.
On their death bed you shall hear the cruellest Oppressors relent, and talk
of a desire and purpose they have, to make satisfaction to them, that they have
wronged this way. But if men should now live to that age, that they did before
the flood, oh how would the earth be filled with cruelty and violence, as the
Lord complains it was in those days? Genesis 6. 13.

2. It abateth the pride that is in man toward the Lord himself. If there be
then a Messenger, etc. says Elihu. Job 33. 23. as if he should say, Then may
Gods faithful servant find audience, even with the proudest man. And how does
affliction abate thus the pride of man? Surely, it makes a man to know
himself, and of how little worth he is, how unable to help himself: 1.
Whereas in prosperity we are apt to advance, and think highly of our selves,
(It was so even with good Hezekiah himself as we read, 2. Chron. 32. 25.)
affliction makes a man know himself and of how little worth he is, how unable
to help himself, Ps. 39 11. When thou with rebukes do chasten man for
iniquity, thou as a Moth, make his beau ty to consume; surely every man is
vanity. 2. Whereas in prosperity our sins are never wont to trouble us, but we
are apt to think our state good enough; affliction uses to awaken the
Conscience, and to bring those sins into their remembrance, that were unknown,
or forgotten before. It summoneth them to appear before God, and constraines
them to think of God, and of his anger due to sin. So says Elihu, Job 36. 8.
When men are tied in the cords of affliction (that is, have some such extreme
affliction upon them, as they know not how to get out of it) then will he show
them their work, and their sin. A notable example we have of this in Joseph's
Brethren: The grievous sin they had committed many years before, and when they
committed it, it never troubled them. Gen, 37. 24, 25. When they had cast him
into a pit, they sat down to eat bread: But when grievous affliction came
upon them, and they were taken for spies, and cast into prison, then their
conscience was awakened, and their sin came into their remembrance, and the
justice of God also, which they had provoked thereby, Then they could say one
to another, Genesis 42. 21. We have verily sinned against our Brother, in that we
saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us, and we would not hear him;
therefore is this trouble come upon us. See this also in David, Psalm. 40 12.
when innumerable evils had compassed him about, then his iniquities took hold
upon him. And this is the first Reason, why affliction is so profitable and
necessary for all Gods children.

Secondly, affliction makes a man seek to God: it wrought so we see here in
this Ruler. In prosperity while we can help our selves, or can find help any
where else, we seldom or never seek seriously to God; we seldom pray, or (if
we do sometimes) we do it full coldly, and drowsily, with great
unwillingness and tediousness. This corruption is in every one of us. Romans 3.
11. There is none that seeks after God. This is notably set forth in the
Parable of the Prodigal, Luke 15. First, while his purse was full, and he in
his iollity, he cared not for his Father, he cared not though he never came at
him, verse 13. Secondly, when he began to be in necessity, he claue to a
Citizen in that Country, verse 15. and thought not yet of returning to his
Father; Thirdly, when he came into extremity, then he said, verse 18. I will
go to my Father. This fruit of affliction is so general, that the Prophet
says, Esaias 26. 16. (as if it wrought so in all men) Lord, in trouble have they
visited thee, they poured out a Prayer when thy chastisement was upon them. So
does David also speak of it, then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble,
Psalm. 107. 6. and repeats it often, verse 13. 19. 28. as if it were the
ordinary use of all men to do so. Two notable examples we have for this: the
one in Psalm 142. 4, 5. I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was
none that would know me: all refuge failed me, and none cared for my soul.
Then cried I unto the Lord, and said, Thou art mine hope. As if he should have
said, I cried not to the Lord, till all other refuge failed me. The other in 2.
Chron. 33. 12, 13. When he was in tribulation he prayed unto the Lord his God,
and humbled himself greatly before the God of his Fathers, and prayed unto
him. True it is, the faithful often in extremity (in their own feeling) seem
unable to pray; but yet the spirit even then helps them, and makes them able
to pray, Romans 8. 26. Yea, (because the Lord greatly delights to have his
people seek to him, let me hear thy voice for it is sweet, Cant. 2. 14.)
this is one chief end he aymeth at in bringing affliction upon them, even to
make them seek and sue unto him, I will go, and return to my place, till
they acknowledge their offense, and seek my face, in their affliction they
will seek me early, Hos. 5. 15.

The third and last Reason, why affliction is so profitable and necessary, is
this, That it prepares the heart to the understanding and obedience of the
Word. True it is, afflictions cannot soundly convert the heart, that honor is
proper to the Word of God, the Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the
soul, Psalm. 19. 7. yet it is a great help to a man's conversion, and of great
use and necessity to prepare the heart, to receive profit by the Word. Yea,
there are few or none that would regard the Word, or profit much by it, if the
Lord should not humble them by afflictions. The Lord has two Schools, wherein
he nourtereth his children. A man that is exercised by affliction, will profit
more by one Sermon, than another will do by ten. Esaias 26. 9. Seeing thy
judgments are on the earth, the inhabitants of the world shall learn
righteousness. When God by affliction has humbled men, and prepared their
hearts, if they might then have good Teachers, they would profit greatly, If
there be then a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand to
declare unto man his righteousness, then he is gracious unto him, etc. Job 33.
23, 24. That made the Psalmist say, Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest O
Lord and teach him out of thy law, Psalm. 94. 12. This David speaks of
himself, Psalm. 119. 71. It is good for ^e that I have been afflicted, that I
may learn thy Statutes. Though he were a most teachable Scholar, yet he
learned better by it, than he could have done without it. While we are in
prosperity, we are like wanton children, apt to play with our meat; many
things we hear we cannot understand, nor be persuaded of: we will believe what
we list, obey what we list, laugh at some truths that are taught us, fret and
rage at other. But affliction will open our ears, if we belong to God, and
make us understand, and be persuaded of many truths, which before we could not
believe. Job 33. 16. Then he opens the ears of men, even by their
corrections, which he has sealed. So that to them that will not be persuaded
it is such a great sin to swear now and then, or to profane the Sabbath, or to
be drunken; that there is such a necessity of hearing the Word preached, as we
have taught; we may say as the Prophet does, Esaias 28. 19. There shall be only
fear, to make you understand the hearing. I warrant you, if you belong to God,
he will by affliction persuade you one day, and make you to understand these
truths. Yea, affliction brings a man to a more clear, certain, and
experimental knowledge of God, and his truth, than ever any without it have
attained unto. 2. Chron. 33. 13. Then Manasses knew that the Lord was God. Job
42. 5. I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye sees
thee.

Lecture the eighty six. April 2. 1611. JOHN IIII. XLVII.
IT remains now, that we proceed to the Uses, that are to be made of this
Doctrine, touching the profitablenesse of affliction, which the time would not
permit us to enter upon the last day. Which I am the more willing to insist
upon, because this Doctrine was never more seasonable (I think) than it is at
this day, in regard of the general Visitation of God, that either is now, or
has been of late in every Village, and in every Family; nay (I think) there
is scarce any one of you, but you are still, or you have been of late,
afflicted with sickness, either in your own persons (as this Rulers son) or
in some that are near and dear unto you (as this Ruler himself was). Two
principal Uses there be then, that we are all to make of this Doctrine: first,
it teaches us how to bear afflictions; secondly, how to profit by them.

For the first: The man that does believe this Doctrine, and is fully
persuaded, that to all Gods Elect, affliction is profitable and necessary, will
first, bear afflictions patiently: secondly, will be comfortable and
cheerful in affliction: thirdly, will even kiss the rod, and be thankful
for afflictions: fourthly, will be so far from desiring to be freed from
affliction, that he will rather desire it, and pray for it. See the experience
and proof of this in Gods children (that were flesh and blood as well as we,
and subject to the same passions and infirmities that we are) in these four
points. First, they have been quiet in their minds, and free from murmuring
and impatience, Psalm. 62. 1. He says (not only as in Psalm. 39. 9. I was
dumb, I opened not my mouth, because thou did it, but) My soul keeps
silence unto God. Secondly, they have been cheerful, and full of joy. Romans
5. 3. Neither do we so only, but also we rejoice in tribulation. Thirdly,
they have been thankful unto God for their afflictions. Job 1. 21. Blessed be
the Name of the Lord. Psalm. 42. 11. Wait on God; for I will yet give him
thanks. Fourthly, they have even desired and prayed for affliction, mistake me
not in this point: I know well affliction is not simply to be prayed for. It is
in it own nature a curse (as I have told you) and fruit of Gods wrath; yet
because the child of God knows it is a mean that God has been wont to do
his people that good that he has not used to do any other way, he may
lawfully desire of God that he would rather afflict him (and that sharply too)
then suffer him to perish, rather use this means to humble and reclaim him,
then tosuffer him to go on in his evil way, else would not the Prophet have
prayed as he does, Ier. 10. 24. O Lord correct me, but with judgment, not in
thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.

I know you will be ready to think, that it is very strange that any should be
able in this manner to bear affliction; and that it were a marvelous
happiness to a man, if he could attain to this measure of grace. I will
therefore show you the mean, whereby the faithful have attained to it, and
where by we also may attain unto it; and that is the believing and considering
of Means to attain to patience. 1.
five principal points, all grounded upon this doctrine.

The first of these considerations, is, That affliction is not a sign of Gods
hatred, but of his love rather; not only his shaking and holding out of his
rod, is a sign of his favor, as that was we read of, Ester found favor in
his sight, and the King held out unto her the golden scepter, Est (...) 2. but
even his whipping and scourging of us with it. Though it be a sign of his
anger, and of a little wrath, as the Lord speaks, Esaias 54 8 yet of his hatred
it is not. Pro. 3. 12. The Lord corrects him whom he loves, even as a father
does the child, in whom he dlighteth. Heb. 12. 6, 7. Whom the Lord loves, he
chasteneth, and scourges every son whom he receives; if ye endure
chastening, God offers himself to you as to sons: for what son is it
whom the father chasteneth not? Therefore Job wondereth at Gods love in this.
Job 7. 17, 18. What is man, that thou do magnify him, and that thou set^est
thy heart upon him, and do visit him every morning, and try est him every
moment? And that is the reason, why the Lord (though he pass by a thousand
foul faults in the wicked) is wont to whip his own people, if they do but
tread awry. Amos 32. You only have I known of all the families of the earth:
therefore I will visit you for all you^ iniquities. And on the other side, it
is spoken of as an argument of God^ wrath and indignation, against desperate
sinners, that God will for beare^o-correct them. Esaias 1. 5. Wherefore should
ye be smitten any more? for y^ fall away more and more. And Hosea 4. 14. I
will not visit your Daughters, when they are Harlots, nor your Spouses, when
they are Whores. Oh, how great is the blindness of such, as because (though
they have often committed gross sins, yet they prosper still, are ready to
conclude, God loves them; and that they that have greatest afflictions, are the
worst men, most out of Gods favor? No, no, affliction is not a sign of Gods
hatred, but of his love rather. And who will not be patient and comfortable in
affliction, that believes this?

The second consideration is this: The Lord certainly intends our good in all
our corrections; yea, to do us that good by them, which we 2.
could not receive by any other means. Be thou assured of this, that if thou
unfeignedly fear God, the Lord intends thy good in every affliction of thine,
though thou cannot yet perceive it. Psalm 25. 10. All the paths of the Lord
are mercy and truth, to all such as keep his covenants and his testimonies.
Heb. 12. 10. He chasteneth us for our profit, that we might be partakers of his
holiness. 1. Cor. 11. 32. When we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord,
that we might not be condemned with the world. Affliction is a medicine,
which (though it be bitter) yet it is well approved by the experience of all
Gods people, that ever were, to be most wholesome and sovereign. If any of us
should in our sickness, have a physician come to us, whom we knew to be so
wise and learned, that he perfectly knew our estate, and what would do us
good, and so loving and good a man also, that he did unfeignedly desire to do
us all the good he could; if this man should prescribe to us a potion, and tell
us, he had no other means to do us good but that, if we take it not, we must
needs die; if we do take it, it will certainly do us good; how strange soever
the working of it seem to be for a while, yet in the end it will certainly do
us good, and recover us: there was never any of his patients received it, but
it did them good; would any of us be so mad, as to reject such a potion, given
us by such a Physician? would we not willingly drink it off every drop, though
it were never so loathsome in color, how bittersoeuer it were in taste, how
much soever it were in quantity? Now such a Physician is the Lord, and such a
medicine is Affliction, When we are judged we are chastened of the Lord, that
we may not be condemned with the world, 1 Cor. 11. 32. He chasteneth us for our
profit; that we might be partakers of his holiness, Heb. 12. 10. Blessed is
the man whom thou chastenest O Lord, and teach him out of thy Law, that thou
may give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be dug for
the wicked, Psalm. 94. 12, 13.

The third consideration that may make us patient and comfortable in
affliction, is this, That God will surely remove it, when it has had that 3.
good work in us, that he has appointed it for. The Lord our God is not like
those hard hearted Chyrurgions, that care not what pain they put their
Patients to; but he is very merciful and tenderhearted: he uses not to apply
corasiues, nor to lance, or sear, but upon great necessity. Lam. 3. 33. He
does not punish willingly, nor afflict the children of men. 1 Pet. 1. 6. Now
for a season (if need require) you are in heaviness, through manifold
tentations. Is thy affliction sharp and painful? certainly, the Lord sees
thou have need of it, or else he would handle thee more gently. When a man has
a deep wound, and festered at the bottom, full of corruption, or has some
bullet, or arrow head, or point of a sword, that must be taken out; the
Chyrurgion can never cure him well, but he must needs put him to great pain,
lance him, and cut him, and make the wound bigger, before he can heal it: and
even so deals the Lord with his patients. Job 5. 17, 18. Behold, blessed is
the man whom God corrects: as if he should say, Happy man is he that ever
came under the hands of this Chyrurgion. Therefore refuse not thou the
chastening of the Almighty: for he makes the wound, and binds it up, and his
hands make whole. The like must we think of the continuance of our afflictions.
Is thy affliction long? certainly thy need requires it should be so; it has
not had the good work in thee yet, God sent it for. The Lord is not like those
covetous and wretched Chirurgions, that (for their own advantage) will
protract their cures; but he is most faithful, and will not keep his patients
a day longer under his hand, than their necessity does require. This made David
say, Psalm. 119. 75. I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that
thou of very faithfulness have caused me to be troubled.

The fourth consideration is, That we have had much more experience of 4.
his goodness toward us in giving us prosperity, than we have had of his
anger in afflicting us; and there is no proportion betwixt the time of our
afflictions and prosperities, that which the Lord speaks by his Prophet, For
a small moment have I for saken thee, but with great mercies will I gather
thee, Esa. 14. 7. that the faithful have found most true in their own
experience. And shall we receive good at the hand of God (and so much good as
we have done) and shall we not receive evil? shall we not patiently bear a
little affliction? Job 2. 10.

The fifth consideration is this, That God will surely support us in all
afflictions, and lay no more upon us, than he will give us strength to bear.
That 5.
place of the Apostle is well known, 1 Cor. 10. 13. God is faithful, and will
not suffer you to be tempted above measure. This is one maine difference
betwixt the afflictions of the reprobate, and the elect; in them, God has no
respect to their strength, but makes them even mad and desperate with his
judgments, They shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, Ier. 25. 16. They
gnawed their tongues for pain, and blasph med the God of heaven because of
their pains, Reu. 16. 10, 11. but it is contrary with the godly: I will
correct thee in measure, says the Lord, Ier. 30. 11. The principal thing that
troubles Gods children in affliction, is the fear of this, That they shall not
be able to abide and en dure it, if it be extreme, if it be long. But against
this fear, comfort thy self in this consideration. Indeed it may be, the Lord
will so press thee with afflictions, that he will cause thy weakness to
appear to thee, more than ever it did. The best have bewrayed great weakness
in extreme affliction. But be thou sure, the more thy weakness appears, the
more will his power appear in supporting and strengthening thee. A very
comfortable place we have for this in 2 Cor. 12. 8, 9. For this thing I
besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And be said unto me; My
grace is sufficient for thee; for my power is made perfect through weakness.
Very gladly therefore will I rejoice rather in my infirmities, that the power
of Christ may dwell in me. On this David stayed himself, Psalm 62. 2. Yet he is
my strength, and my defense: therefore I shall not much be moved: as if he
should say, Somewhat I may be moved, but much I shall not. Psalm 37. 24. Though
he fall, he shall not be cast off; for the Lord puts under his hand. 2 Cor.
4. 89. We are afflicted on every side, yet are we not in distress; in poverty,
but not overcome of poverty; we are persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down,
but perish not. Look which of his servants God has been pleased to exercise
with his greatest crosses, to them he has been wont to give the greatest
measure of strength, that they might be able to bear them. As Abraham, Job,
David, Paul: And so may every one of the faithful be assured he will like wise
deal with them.

The sixth and last thing that may make us patient and comfortable in
affliction, 6.
is the consideration of the blessed end, that God has been ever wont to make
of the afflictions of his servants. When they have endured any great fight in
affliction, he has ever used to bestow some special favor or other upon them
as it were in liew and recompense of their affliction, that they have endured;
as Princes use to do on them that have undergone any great loss or danger in
their service. When God has visited his servants with any sore affliction, he
has never been wont to depart without leaving a blessing behind him, as he did
when he had wrestled with Jacob, Genesis 32. 28, 29. yea, proportionable to the
measure of the affliction, has the blessing been wont to be. They that have
had the bitterest crosses, have received the sweetest comforts.

1 He blesses them with temporal blessings sometimes, and makes their estate
better after it, than it was before. I will visit upon her the days of Baalim
(that is, all the time of that extreme affliction which I brought upon her for
that grievous sin) wherein she burnt incense unto them, etc. therefore,
behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak
comfortably unto her; And I will give her, her vineyards from thence, and the
valley of Achor for a door of hope, and she shall sing there, etc. Hos. 2. 13,
-- 15. For your shame you shall have double; and for confusion they shall
rejoice in their pertion; therefore in their land they shall possess the
double, Esa. 61. 7. James 5. 11. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have
known what end the Lord made. And what was that? Job 42. 10. The Lord turned
the captivity of Job, and gave him twice so much as he had before. Iocl 2. 25,
26. I will restore to you the ears that the Locust has eaten, and the
Canker-worme, and the Caterpillar, etc. and ye shall eat in plenty, and be
satisfied. In respect of this proportion the Lord uses to keep, Moses prays,
Psalm. 90. 15. Comfort us according to the days that thou have afflicted us,
and according to the years that we have seen evil.

2 Sometimes God gives an increase of spiritual comforts and grace. Esa. 30.
20, 21. When the Lord has given you the bread of adversity, and the water of
affliction, thy Teachers shall be no more kept back, but thine eyes shall see
thy Teachers, and thine ear shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is
the way, walk ye in it, when thou turnest to the right hand, and when thou
turnest to the left. This Paul speaks in his own experience, 2 Cor. 1. 5. As
the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation abounds through
Christ. Yea, he assures the faithful of the same in a very confident manner,
Verse 7. And our hope is steadfast concerning you, in as much as we know, that
as ye are made partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the
consolation. In all thy afflictions therefore think of this blessing, wait for
it, and comfort thy self in the expectation of it. This is that that kept
David from fainting in his affliction. Psalm. 71. 20. 21. Thou have showed me
great troubles and adversities, but thou will revive me; and wilt come again
and take me up from the depth of the earth, thou will increase mine honor, and
return and comfort me.

Lecture the eighty seven. April 9. 1611. JOHN IIII. XLVII.
THe last day I came to the Use that was to be made of the Doctrine touching
the profitablenesse of affliction; and showed you that it served, First, to
teach us to bear afflictions patiently and comfortably. Secondly, to examine
and judge of our estate by the profits and benefits we make of Use 2.
our afflictions. The former of these we handled the last day, and now are we
to proceed to the second. For, if affliction be so profitable (as we have
heard) to all Gods Elect, then may every one of us judge of his own estate, by
the profit we have received by our affliction. To have affliction, is no
certain sign of Gods favor: for the Reprobate as well as the Elect are
subject unto it. But there is a marvelous difference betwixt the afflictions
of the Elect and those of the Reprobate. Has he smitten him, as he smote those
that smote him, says the Prophet? Esaias 27. 7. As if he should say, Has the
Lord smitten Israel, as he smote them that were the enemies of Israel? And this
is a principal difference, that the children of God are made the better by
their afflictions; but the reprobates and ungodly are not made the better, but
the worse rather, by their afflictions. Of the one it is said, Romans 8. 28. All
things work together for the good of them that love God: Of the other, Ier.
12. 13. They were sick, and had no profit. Let every one of us therefore
labor to find in us this mark of our Election, this difference betwixt our
selves and the Reprobate, that God has not smitten us, as he smote them, that
our affliction has been sanctified unto us, we have profited by it, we are
able to say with David in the truth of our hearts, Psalm. 119. 71. It is good
for me that I have been afflicted. In all our afflictions let us do as Jacob
did, Genesis 32. 26. that is, we must not let the Lord go till he have blessed us.
Weep and pray for that blessing, which (as I told you the last day) the Lord is
wont to give unto his children, when he has wrastled with them, and afflicted
them: as the Prophet says Jacob did, Hos. 12. 4.

And for your help and mine own in this examination of our selves, I will
give you out of Gods Word six Notes, whereby we may try whether our affliction
has been sanctified unto us. And those are (as it were) six degrees whereby
the Spirit of God proceeds, in sanctifying the afflictions of all his
children, and teaching them to profit by them.

1 He causes them (by all their afflictions) to take notice that God is
displeased with them, God has some matter against them. In all extraordinary
and strange judgments that are upon us, every one of us should say to his own
heart, as God says his people would say, Deuteronomy. 31. 17. Are not all these
troubles come upon me, because God is not with me? because God is offended with
me: yea, this should we do also in the most ordinary and small afflictions that
do befall us. When God had taken away from Naomi her two sons (though by an
ordinary and usual death) she says, Ruth 1. 13. That the hand of the Lord was
gone out against her. We can never profit by affliction, till we can resolve
upon this, in every sickness, in every cross, that God is the Author of it;
God visits us; the hand of God is upon us; and that he uses not to strike any
till he be angry with them. When we are judged (says the Apostle, 1 Cor. 11.
32. though it be but with such judgments as he there speaks of, Verse 10.
sickness and weakness) we are chastened of the Lord. And (though the Lord do
sometimes afflict his children, rather for their trial, than for any
displeasure he has conceived against them, as in Jobs case it was, yet)
usually he never strikes till he be angry. So the Lord speaks of the
afflictions of his dear children, Esaias 54. 8. For a moment in mine anger I hid
my face from thee. And 57. 17. For his wicked covetousness I was angry with
him; I hid me, and was angry. We should therefore in the least affliction upon
us, labor to take notice of this, and do as we are required, Micah 6. 9. Hear
the rod, and who has appointed it. There is never a rod of God, but it has a
voice: by it (as by a Herald) God proclaims, and testifies against us, that
he is offended; as it is said, Ezekiel. 38. 22. I will plead against him with
pestilence and with blood: we should therefore hear the rod.

Let us then examine our selves by this first Note, and we shall find, that
Application.
there be very few of us, that receive any profit by our afflictions: for we
never take notice of Gods displeasure in them. It may be, in some sudden and
extraordinary judgment we will, but in ordinary diseases, and other crosses,
we never discern the hand that smites us; but harden our selves to bear them
off with head and shoulders by these and such like conceits: There is no man
but shall have crosses, none but they shall be sick sometimes; such and such
have had this Ague, and done well enough, and so I hope shall I. Thus God
brings in his people, reporting how they had hardened their hearts against his
corrections, Ier. 10. 19. I thought it is my sorrow, and I will bear it.
Should any man be so foolish (say they) as to think that God is angry with
him, because he afflicts him sometimes? Why, the best have had their
afflictions: and whom God loves, he chastens. And with these conceits many
that have no one good argument of Gods fatherly love, harden themselves against
the sense of his anger in their afflictions. For this senslesnesse God checketh
his people, Hos. 7. 9. Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knows it
not; gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knows it not. As if he
should say, Extreme misery and grief had brought gray hairs upon him, and yet
remained he senseless, and never took notice from whence this came, Esaias 42.
25. He has powered upon him the fury of his anger, and yet he knew not; and it
burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.

The second Note to try whether our affliction be sanctified to us, whether we
have profited by it, is this, If it have caused us to humble our selves under 2.
the hand of God that is upon us, if it have made us sorrow and grieve that we
have offended God. This is a singular fruit of affliction; and he has begun to
profit by his affliction, that finds this in himself: for God is maruellously
pleased with this, to see men humbled when he has showed himself angry. See
the respect he had to Josiah for this, 2 Kings 22. 19, 20. Because thy heart
did melt, and thou have humbled thy self before the Lord, when thou heardst
what I spoke against this place; behold therefore thine eyes shall not see all
the evil that I will bring upon this place. Nay, see what respect God had to
Ahab for this, or rather for an outward show of this, 1 Kings 21. 29. See
thou bow Ahab is humbled before me? because he submits himself before me, I
will not bring evil in his days. This is the way to be rid of affliction. 1
Pet. 5. 6. Humble your selves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt
you in due time. And on the other side, God cannot endure the contempt of his
judgments; to see us merry and iocund, when he is angry, or to set light by
his corrections. Esa. 22. 12, -- 14 When God called to weeping and mourning, to
baldness and sackcloth; and behold joy and gladness, eating flesh and
drinking wine: eating and drinking, for tomorrow we shall die. Surely this
iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, says the Lord of hosts. And
surely, if every affliction be a sign that God is displeased with us, it
becomes the child of God to be humbled by every affliction; though not in
respect of the cross it self (which happily is common, and such as many have
had, and done well enough) yet in respect of the Lord and his displeasure, from
whence it comes, Hear the rod, and who has appointed it, Micah 6. 9. For, is
it a small matter to have the Lords frowns and displeasure? Amos 3. 6. Shall a
trumpet be blown in a City, and the people not be afraid? or shall there be
evil in a City, and the Lord has not done it? When Moses was a suitor for his
sister Miriam, he received this answer from the Lord, Numb. 12. 14. If her
father had spit in her face, should she not have been ashamed seven days? as
if he should say, How much more should she be humbled and ashamed, when I have
showed my self to be offended with her? For this, we have a notable example in
Job 1. 20. who, though he was so holy and righteous a man, and though he could
say, Blessed be the Name of the Lord, for all his afflictions, yet when he
considered all this came of God (he thought neither of the Sabeans nor
Caldeans, the fire nor the wind; but he considered, The Lord had given, and
the Lord had taken:) Then Job arose, and rent his garment, and shaued his head,
and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped: and the Holy Ghost says, Verse
22. In all this Job did not sin. And if Job did thus humble himself, when Gods
hand was upon him, what man is there whom it will not well become to do so? On
the other side, this is noted to be the disposition of the wicked, to whom
affliction is not sanctified, that it does not humble them at all. Ier. 5. 3.
Thou have stricken them, but they have not sorrowed; thou have consumed them,
but they have refused to receive correction. And this is the cause, why God is
constrained to bring strange and more grievous judgments upon us, because we
will not feel, nor be moved with ordinary corrections, If ye walk contrary
unto me, and will not hearken unto me (for all this) I will bring seven times
more plagues upon you, according to your sins, Leuit. 26. 21.

The third note, whereby we are to try whether our affliction be sanctified unto
us, is this, If it cause us to search our ways, and to enquire into the cause
3.
of that displeasure God has conceived against us, we must enquire into the
cause; it is to no purpose to be sorry and humbled for our affliction, unless
we do this. Every man must desire to know the cause of his affliction, Every
man must know the plague of his own heart, find out the cause of the plague in
his own heart, 1 Kings 8. 38. and say with Ier. 2. 17. Have thou not procured
this unto thy self, in that thou have forsaken the Lord thy God, when he led
thee by the way? This was the course God directed Joshua to, when he was
humbled, because the Lord had showed himself to be angry with the Congregation
of Israel, Josh. 7. 10, 11. Wherefore lie thou upon thy face? Israel has
sinned. Search and find out the man, that has provoked me to anger. For this
we must rest resolved of, That man's sin is ever the cause of Gods anger, Esaias
57. 17. For his wicked covetousness I was angry with him, and have smitten
him. And 64. 5. Behold, thou art angry; for we have sinned. And therefore it is
to no purpose, for a man to grieve and vex himself in his affliction, if he
rest there; he shall never have ease, till he can find out the cause of it in
himself. Ier. 30. 15. Why cryest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is
incurable for the multitude of thine iniquities. As in a wound, that has some
point of a sword, or bullet, or such like thing in the bottom of it; till that
be found, there can be no hope of cure. Lam. 3. 39, 40. Wherefore then is the
living man sorrowful, man suffers for his sin, let us search and try our
ways. Let no man say, Tush, that cannot be the cause of my affliction; though
I be a sinner, yet I am no worse than other men: I am no such notorious sinner.
God sees, thou think too well of thy self, and he has therefore afflicted
thee, to make thee look more narrowly unto thy own ways. Be thou assured of
this, that he cannot wrong thee. And say, Psalm. 119. 75. I know that thy
judgments are right, and that thou have afflicted me justly. And therefore, if
at the first view thou can not find out the cause, search better; yea, pray
the Lord to help thee in this search, as he did, Job 10. 2. Show me wherefore
thou contendest with me: and 13. 23. Show me my rebellion and my sin. For
this we have a notable example in David, 2 Samuel 21. 1. When there was a famine
in the land, David asked counsel of the Lord. The meaning is (as appears
plainly by the Lords answer) he enquired into the cause of that famine. The
contrary is observed, as a note of a desperate sinner, that contemns Gods
chastisements, and receives no profit by them. Ier. 8. 6. No man said, what
have I done? And Ezekiel. 16. 43. I have brought thy way upon thine own head, yet
have thou not had consideration of thy abominations.

The fourth note is, If it have made us careful to make our peace with 4.
God. For this we have a notable example, Numb. 16. 46. Moses said to Aaron,
take the censer, and put fire therein from off the Altar, and put incense
therein, and go quickly unto the Congregation, and make an atonement for them:
for there i^ wrath gone out from the Lord, the plague is begun. This is that
the Lord looks for at our hands, in all our crosses; and the chief end he
aims at in afflicting his children, is to cause them to seek him more
diligently, and to get better assurance of his favor. Esa. 27. 5. Will he
apprehend (that is, take notice of, and acknowledge) my strength, that he may
make peace with me, and be at one with me? And we shall find three ways,
whereby the faithful have sought peace with the Lord in this case. First, by
acknowledging freely unto him their sin, and so justifying him in his
judgments, as David did, Psalm. 32. 5. Then I acknowledged my sin unto thee,
neither hid I mine iniquity: for I said, I will confess against my self my
wickedness to the Lord, and thou forgauest the punishment of my sin, Job 33.
27, 28. Secondly, by praying earnestly unto God, and seeking assurance of his
favor in the pardon of their sin, Job 9. 15. Esaias 26. 16. Lord, in trouble
have they visited thee: they poured out a prayer when thy chastisement was upon
them. Thirdly, by forsaking their sin, whereby they had provoked him, and so
removing the cause of his displeasure. Esaias 27. 9. By this therefore shall the
iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit, the taking away of his
sin: This course the Ninevites took, Jonah 3. 8. The contrary is observed as
a note of a desperate sinner, when in his affliction he never seeks to God.
Hos. 7. 14. They have not cried to me in their hearts, when they howled upon
their beds. Esaias 9. 13. The people turns not to him that smites them,
neither do they seek the Lord of hosts. And 57. 17. I hid me, and was angry,
yet they went away. These men are like unto ungracious Absolon, 2. Sam. 13. 38.
when his father was justly provoked, he never sought to him, but fled, and went
to Geshur, and was three years there: his father was readier to seek to him,
than he unto his father.

The fifth note, If it have brought us to vow unto God greater obedience, 5.
and care of our ways for the time to come. Psalm 66. 14. David speaks of
vows which his lips had promised, and his mouth had spoken in his affliction.
And 61. 8. and 132. 1, 2. Remember David, Lord, with all his afflictions, who
swear unto the Lord, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob, etc. and 119. 7.
It is said of our blessed Savior himself, Heb. 5. 8. Though he were the Son,
yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered: that is to say, he
showed his obedience more then, than before; how much more should we? Of
Hezekiah it is said, 2. Kings 20. 8. that he asked the Prophet, What is the
sign that the Lord will heal me, and that I shall go up the third day to
the house of the Lord: and the reason of the demand was, because God had
promised him, verse 5. that he should do so. But if we compare that with
Ezekiahs prayer, Esaias 38. 20. it will appear, that God had respect in that
promise, to the desire that Hezekiah had had, and the vow that he had made in
his affliction, that he would love the house of the Lord the better while he
lived: yea this, the very light of nature has taught men to do, the mariners
that carried Jonah did so; they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows.
Jonah 1. 16.

The sixth note is, If we be careful to perform the vows we have 6.
made, when our affliction is gone and past. Most hypocrites have many good
motions and purposes, and seem to be new men in their afflictions; but when
Gods hand is removed, they return to their old byas again: yea, become worse
than before. An example we have of this in Pharaoh often times, specially, when
he saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder were ceased, he sinned yet
more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants, Ex. 9. 34. and in the wicked
Israelites, when he slew them then they sought him and they returned and
enquired early after God, Psalm. 78. 34. But on the other side, the Elect are
able to say, they are the better for their afflictions afterward, as David
did, Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I have kept thy word, Psalm.
119. 67. And of all the chastisements God lays on his children, it is said,
that afterward they bring the quiet fruit of righteousness, Heb. 12. 11. Let
every one therefore consider, what he promised to God in the time of his
affliction, and how he has kept promise with God since; and think well of
that speech of Solomon, Eccles. 5. 3, 4. When thou vowest a vow unto God,
defer not to pay it; for he has no pleasure in fools: pay therefore that
which thou have vowed. Better is it that thou should not vow, than vow and
not pay it.

THE EIGHTY EIGHT LECTVRE, ON APRIL XXIII. MDCXI.
JOHN IIII. XLVIII, XLIX, L. Then said Jesus unto him, except ye see signs
and wonders, ye will not believe.

The Noble man says, Sir, come down ere my child dye.

Jesus says unto him, go thy way, thy son lives: and the man believed the
word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.


WE have already heard, that from the beginning of the 46. verse, to the end of
the Chapter, the Evangelist sets down the History of the first miracle, that
our Savior wrought after his return out of Judea into Galile. And that this
History stands upon four parts: first, the occasion that was offered unto
Christ, to do this miracle: secondly, the manner how Christ wrought this
miracle: thirdly, the fruit and effect of this miracle: fourthly, the
conclusion of the story. The occasion is set down in the 46. and 47. verses,
which I finished the last day. It follows now that we proceed to the manner
how this miracle was wrought, which is contained in these words I have now read
unto you. And in setting down this, the Evangelist observes three things:
First, the check and reproof, that Christ gave unto this great man, and to
his whole Nation, verse 48. Then said Jesus unto him, except ye see signs and
wonders, ye will not believe. Secondly, the answer this great man made to
Christ, when he had been thus rebuked by him, verse 49. The Ruler said unto
him, Sir, go down before my son dye. Thirdly, the comfort and satisfaction
that Christ gave unto the Ruler, after he had thus reproved him, and received
this answer from him, verse 50. Jesus says unto him; go thy way, thy son
lives.

First, then we must observe here the course, that our Savior took with this
great man. Then, when he saw him to be in great heaviness, for the extremity
that his son was in; Then, when he saw him come in this humble manner unto
him, to beseech him for help, when one would have thought, he should have
pitied his case, and spoken comfortably unto him, and commended and fostered
those good beginnings that he saw in him, and rejoiced, that he had so great a
man come to him for help: even then, I say, does he take a quite contrary
course with him; he seems to be not at all moved with his misery, nor to
regard his suit: but in stead of comforting of him, and helping him, he checkes
and rebukes him: Then said Jesus unto him, except ye see signs and wonders,
ye will not believe. As if he should say, I can do you no good, except you
had Faith, and you (neither thou nor thy Contrymen) have any Faith; no, you
will not believe, you are obstinate in your infidelity. God has by his Word,
and by the Ministry of John the Baptist, sufficiently manifested me to be the
Messiah, yet you will not believe his Word, unless you may have miracles to
confirm it: yea, I have already (by many miracles) declared my self evidently
to be the Son of God, (which also you have heard of) yet that will not serve
the turn, but unless you may see with your own eyes, you will not believe.
Nay, you have (many of you) seen my miracles, yet will not that serve neither,
but unless ye may see signs and wonders, that is, many miracles, miracles of
all sorts; you will not believe. Mark, how roughly he deals with him, and
yet for all this, he intended not to reject him, but he loved him dearly; even
when he did thus vpbraid and disgrace him, he purposed to help him, and to
grant his request: yea, he purposed to convert and save his soul; as appears
by that which follows in the story. And therefore even in seeming thus to
neglect him, in rebuking him after this manner, he sought his good. From hence
then this Doctrine arises for our instruction:

That the Lord often times sees it to be good for his dearest children, Doct. 1.
to put them off for a time, and seem to neglect them, and their prayers.

Before I confirm the Doctrine, let me entreat you to consider well of the
matter, and you will see cause to wonder at it, and so you will be the better
stirred up, to attend unto the proof and confirmation of it. First, he has
bound himself by promise, to hear his servants when they call upon him, and
to grant what they ask, according to his will John 15. 7. If ye abide in me,
and my Words abide in you, ask what you will, and it shall be done unto you.
Secondly, and specially has he bound himself to hear them in those prayers,
that they make unto him in their afflictions. Psalm 50. 15. Call upon me in
the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shall glorify me.
Thirdly, yea this has been the chief means, whereby Gods people have sought
comfort in all their afflictions, even to pour out their hearts to God in
prayer. Psalm 109. 3, 4. They compassed me about (says David) with words of
hatred, and fought against me without a cause, for my friendship they were
mine enemies, but I gave my self to prayer. And fourthly, the thing that has
encouraged, them, and given them heart in prayer, has been this hope and
assurance, that they should find audience and respect with God. Psalm 65. 2.
Because thou hear prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come. And 86. 7. In the
day of my trouble, I will call upon thee: for thou hear me. Fifthly,
therefore above all their afflictions, this has most afflicted them, this has
gone nearest their heart, when they have prayed, and could not perceive that
God has heard them, or has had any respect unto their prayers. Psalm 28. 1.
O my God, my strength, be not deaf toward me, lest if thou answer me not, I
be like them that go down into the pit. And yet for all this, the Lord has
seemed often unto his dearest children, to fail in this his promise, to neglect
them altogether, and to have had no respect unto their prayers, they have made
unto him in their affliction. See the proof of this in four degrees.

First, when they have prayed unto him, and that also according to his will, he
has long forborne to grant them their requests; he has made them wait and
attend so long, till they have been almost weary with waiting, as here he
holds off the Ruler. Psalm 69. 3. David complains thus, I am weary with
crying, my throat is dry, mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. And 119.
8. Mine eyes fail for thy promise, saying, When will thou comfort me? And
verse 123. Mine eyes have failed in waiting for thy salvation, and for thy just
promise.

Secondly, he has not only thus forborne long to grant them their requests,
but has even refused for a time to give them any answer at all, or to show any
respect that he has had unto their prayers. As here, he makes no answer at all
to the Rulers suit, nor shows any compassion on him. This we shall find the
faithful often complaining of, that they could find no comfort in their
prayers, they could not perceive they were ever the better for them. Lament. 3.
8. When I cry and shout, he shuts out my prayer. And verse 44. Thou have
covered thy self with a cloud, that our prayers should not pass through. Job
30. 20. When I cry to thee, thou do not hear me, neither regardest when I
stand up. And Psalm 22. 2. O my God, I cry by day, but thou hear not, and
by night, but have not audience.

Thirdly, he has not only forborne to grant their requests, and refused to
give them any comfortable answer; but he has seemed to frown, and hide
himself from them, and even to shake them off in anget; to be more offended
with them for praying to him, than he was before. So dealt he here with this
Ruler, that came to him in his misery, and besought him for help and succor,
he checkes and chides him, as you have heard. So dealt he also with the poor
woman of Canaan, Matthew. 15. First, when the poor woman cried to him, verse 22.
Have mercy on me, O Lord, the son of David, my daughter is miserably vexed
with a Devil: it is said, verse 23. that he answered her not a word.
Secondly, when his Disciples became suitors to him for her, verse 24. He
answered and said, that he was not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of
Israel. Thirdly, when the poor woman came, verse 25. 26. for all this, and
worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me; He answered and said, it is not good to
^ake the childrens bread, and cast it unto whelps. And thus has it fallen out
with Gods dear children, they have been so far from finding comfort in
their prayers, and obtaining a gracious answer from God, that their discomforts
and terrors have seemed to increase much thereby; they have been further
persuaded of Gods anger against them, than they were before. This the Church
complains of, Psalm. 80. 4. O Lord of hosts, how long will thou be angry
against the prayers of thy people.

Fourthly, neither has he seemed thus to refuse to grant their requests only,
when they have begged temporal blessings of him (as the Ruler in this place)
but even in those prayers they have made unto him for spiritual blessings. 2.
Cor. 12. 8. Paul besought the Lord thrice, that the prick in his flesh, the
messenger of Satan, that was sent to buffet him, might depart from him: But
could not obtain it.

Let us now come to consider of the Reasons, why the Lord has been wont to
deal in this sort with his children. Reason.


To humble them the more deeply for their sins, and so to make them 1.
more capable of his grace, he seems for a time to turn away from them' and
to stop his ears at their cries. We are apt to think, that a little sorrow
for sin is enough, and that we should be undone, if we should continue in it
any time; but the Lord sees, that it is very profitable and necessary for many
of his servants to be deeply humbled, and that it is not good for them to be
comforted too soon. And what measure and continuance of sorrow is sufficient
and good for us, he knows best. This the Lord had respect unto in refusing to
grant Paul's request, 2. Cor. 12. 7, 8. he saw he would be in danger to be
exalted and not be humbled enough, if he should ease him of that affliction so
soon as he desired.

The Lord does this to try and exercise the faith and obedience of his 2.
servants, that the same being found to be sincere, it might yield them the
more comfort. He tries their obedience whether they will continue to seek unto
him, and call upon him (because they know he has commanded them to do it)
though they feel no comfort in it. And he tryes their faith, whether they will
believe his promise, and wait for the performance of it, though he delay it
long. This Christ had respect unto in those repulses he gave to the poor woman
of Canaan; as appears plainly Matthew. 15. 28. O Woman, great is thy faith, be
it unto thee as thou desire.

The Lord does this to make his servants more fervent and importunate in prayer
unto him, for his grace and favor, that so they may 3.
feel the more comfort in it, and make more account of it when they have
recovered it. As when a man has obtained a thing by long suite, and it has
cost him much, he will esteem of it the more, and think himself the more
beholding to him that granted it. To this the Lord Jesus had respect in
withdrawing himself so long from his dear Spouse. Cant. 3. 1 -- 4. She
sought him, first, in her bed by night, she sought him but she found him not;
secondly, then she sought him in the City by the streets and open places, she
sought him, but she found him not; thirdly, then she inquired of the Watchmen
that went about the City, Have ye seen him whom my soul loves? At length
(when with so great pains and diligent seeking she had found him) she says,
She took hold on him, and left him not. This is the fruit of extreme
affliction, to increase feruencie in prayer. It was so in our Head, Luke 22.
44. being in an Agony, he prayed more earnestly: And so it is in all his
members likewise.

This Doctrine serves principally for two Uses: 1. For comfort. 2. For
exhortation.

First, it serves to comfort such of Gods servants, as the Lord shall at any
time deal in this manner with, as he did here with this Ruler; that Use. 1.
in their affliction pray, but obtain not: they pray long and often, and
receive no comfort at all. If this be thy case (as it may be the case of any of
us) be not discouraged, faint not under this tentation, cease not, nor give
over to pray, and seek unto God, though he seem to turn away from thee, and
to stop his ear, yea to be angry with thee for it. Consider it is thy duty to
wait, rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him, Psalm. 37. 7. I waited
patiently for the Lord, and he inclined unto me and heard my cry, Psalm. 40. 1.
But for thy comfort and encouragement, observe these five points.

1. Thou art not the only man with whom the Lord has dealt thus; but there
have been many of his dearest children (of whom thou can make no doubt that
they were highly in his favor) whom he has been wont to use in this manner;
nay, with whom he has dealt far more roughly than he does with thee; as I
have made it evident unto thee, in the proof of the doctrine. Nay, there is
scarce one of a thousand of Gods children, but (at one time or other, in one
degree or other) they have been exercised with this tentation. This
consideration has great force to comfort Gods children, in this and all other
their afflictions. By this argument the Apostle comfort the faithful, 1.
Pet. 4. 12. Dearly beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial
which is among you, to prove you, as though some strange thing were come unto
you. and 5. 9. Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same
afflictions are accomplished in your Brethren that are in the world.

2. Be thou fally assured, that thou never calledst upon him in truth and with
an upright heart, nor askedst ought according to his will, but he heard thee,
and took it in good part, and regarded thy prayer, and will certainly grant
thy request, whatsoever he has seemed to thee to do. To this end think often
of these promises. Esaias 30. 10. He will certainly have mercy upon thee at the
voice of thy cry; when he hears thee he will answer. Psalm. 145. 18, 19. The
Lord is near to all that call upon him, yea to all that call upon him in
truth. He will fulfill the desire of them that fear him, he also will hear
their cry, and will save them. 1. John 5. 14, 15. This is the confidence that
we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will he hears us.
And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the
petitions that we desired. Yea, though thy prayer be imperfect and weak, yet
remember that this promise is made to all. Romans 10. 12, 13. He that is Lord
over all, is rich unto all, that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon
the Name of the Lord shall be saved. See the proof of this in a prayer, made
in much infirmity, when David said in his have and passion (through the
violence of his tentation) that he was cut off from before the eyes of God
(that he was but a castaway) yet for all that, God heard the voice of his
supplications, Psalm. 31. 22. Yea, be thou sure of this, that he is much more
ready to give than thou can be to ask. 1. Pet. 3. 12. His ears are open, as
a kind mother or nurse; which use to be so wakefull, as they will hear the
child so soon as ever it begins to cry. Dan. 5. 10. Fear not Daniel, for
from the first day that thou did set thy heart to understand, and to humble
thy self before thy God, thy words were heard. And Esaias 65. 24. Yea, before
they call I will answer, and while they speak I will hear. This the faithful
have gloried in, Psalm. 4. 3. and 17. 6. and 38. 15. This reason is of great
force to encourage and hearten us to perseverance in prayer, O thou that
hear prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come, Psalm. 65. 2. In the day of my
trouble I will call upon thee, for thou will answer me, Psalm. 87. 7.

3. It may well be that God regards thy prayer, and answers thee too, though he
do not presently grant that, that thou desire of him. If after thy prayer
thou find the comfort and peace of thy conscience increased, thou art well
enough, though thou obtain not that thou askedst: Yea, this is the most
comfortable answer of all, that God uses to give to the prayers of his
servants. By this (as by the fire which he was wont to send from heaven to
consume the sacrifice, 2. Chron. 7. 1.) he does testify, that he is well
pleased with the prayers of his servants. And this kind of answer the godly
seldom fail of. Psalm. 35. 13. I humbled my self with fasting, and my prayer
was turned into mine own bosom. This answer David received, even whilst he
was praying, Psalm. 6. 8, 9. Away from me all ye workers of iniquity (mark
what case he was in before, from verse 1. to 7.) for the Lord has heard the
voice of my weeping, the Lord has heard my petitions, the Lord will receive my
prayer. This the Apostle speaks of, as a thing the faithful may be sure of,
whenever they pray aright, in every thing by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving, let your request be made known unto God, and the peace of God
which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through
Christ Jesus, Phil. 4. 6, 7.

The fourth comfort against this temptation, is this, If the Lord do for a
time withold, not only the thing thou prayedst for, but this answer also; yet
be thou assured, he does it for thy good: he does it for one of those three
ends thou heardest of in the doctrine. And if thou can find that the Lords
delays have had those effects in thee (they have humbled thee, they have
approved thy faith and obedience, they have increased thy desire and estimation
of his favor) thou art a happy man. The Lord in granting our requests,
respects not so much our words, as the meaning of his spirit in our prayers,
Rom 8. 27.

A fifth comfort against this tentation, is this, That till the appointed time
come, till God see it good to give thee, either the thing thou ask, or that
sweet peace and comfort of conscience that I spoke of, he will certainly give
thee strength to abide this trial. This is the thing thou most fear and
complainest of, thou feel thy self ready to faint and give over; but be of
good comfort, though he let thee feel thy weakness, and how unable thou art
to stand or go alone, yet (as the Nurse that dandles the Child) he holds
thee, and will not let thee fall. Thus David speaks of himself in the time of
a most grievous temptation, Psalm. 73. 22, 23. I was as a beast before thee, yet
was I always with thee, thou have holden me by my right hand. Thus though God
refused to hearken to Paul, in causing the messenger of Satan to depart from
him (though he prayed thrice for it), yet did he hear and answer his prayer,
2. Cor. 12. 9. He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my power
is made perfect through weakness. And this may be a certain argument to a
man that God has heard, and received his prayer (though he do delay to grant
his request) when Gods grace makes a man able to continue in prayer, and to
hold out, though it be with much pain and discomfort. For this comes not of
our selves, but is a singular gift of God. This is plainly proved, Psalm. 10.
17. Lord, thou have heard the desire of the poor, thou will prepare their
heart, thou will cause thine ear to hear. And this testimony every true
believer may be sure to find in himself, even when to his own feeling he
has least grace, the spirit of God will help and sustain his infirmity, Romans
8. 26. Therefore (to conclude this first Use) I will say to them, whom God
exercises with this tentation, that which the Apostle does to them that suffer
persecution for righteousness sake, and fear they shall not be able to hold
out, 1. Pet. 4. 19. Let them commit their souls to God in well doing, as unto
a faithful Creator.

The second Use of this doctrine, is, to exhort all Gods people that they would
labor so to pray, as they may have assurance to be heard when they Use. 2.
pray; for these comforts belong not to all, but to such as pray aright.

It has bin wont to be a matter of greatest discomfort to Gods people (as we
have heard) when they have prayed and could not find any audience with God, be
not silent unto me, lest if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go
down into the pit, Psalm. 28. (...). Therefore should we both mark well, what
we have prayed for, and observe what entertainment we find when we go to our
Father, listen and hearken what answer we receive from him. David prays often
for an answer, in thy faithfulness consider me, Psalm. 143. 1. As he that is a
suitor to the King, or any great man, when he has delivered his petition, will
be diligent to enquire what the King says to it; so should we do. Psalm. 8^.
8. I will hearken what the Lord God will say, for he will speak peace, etc.
Two benefits we should receive by it: 1. It would work in us a great increase
of comfort and assurance of Gods favor, of thankfulness and love to God, if
we might perceive that he had respect to our prayers whenever we called upon
him, so did it in David, as we shall find in many places of the Psalms, Psalm.
6. 8, 9. and 28. 6. and 66. 19, 20. and 61. 4, 5. and 116. 1 -- 4. 2. If by
observing we shall find that he has had no respect to our prayers, it would
humble and drive us to search into the cause of it, and so enforce us to make
peace with him.

Four things there are required in him that would so pray as he may have
assurance to find audience, and to receive a good answer from God. 1. The man
himself must be in Gods favor, and know himself to be reconciled unto God in
Christ, the Lord had respect to Abel and to his offering, first to Abel and
then to his offering, Genesis 4. 4. 2. He must bring a heart that has unfeignedly
repented of all known sins, and resolved to do the will of God in all
things, If I regard iniquity in mine heart, the Lord will not hear me, Psalm.
66. 18. we know that God hears not sinners, Ioh. 9. 31. If thou will not
hearken to God, thou can have no hope that he will hear thee, as he cried
and they would not hear, so they cried and I would not hear, says the Lord
of hoasts, Zach. 7. 13. 3. He must take heed the things he prays for be such
as God has in his Word warranted him to ask, this is the confidence that we
have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us, 1.
John 5. 14. 4. He must not pray coldly, nor drowsily, but fervently, I will
pray and cry aloud, and he shall hear my voice, not for the loudness of his
voice, but for the feruency of his spirit that made him cry so loud, Psalm. 55.
17. The effectual seruent prayer of arighteous man, avails much, James 5. 16.

Lecture the eighty nine. June 11. 1611. JOHN IIII. XL VIII -- L.
IT follows now to consider why, and for what fault, our Savior thus
rebukes this Ruler. And we shall find, that his sin that he rebuked him
for, was his infidelity, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not
believe. As if he should say, I can do thee no good, except thou had Faith;
but you, neither thou nor thy nation, have any true faith, you do not believe
me to be Christ, the Savior of the world, as the Samaritans of Sychar did;
nay, which is worse, you will not believe, you are obstinate in your
infidelity. God has sufficiently by his Word, and by the Ministry of John
Baptist manifested me to be the Messiah: but that will not serve your turn,
you will not believe, except you have miracles to confirm it: yea, I have
already by many miracles declared my self evidently to be the Son of God:
which also you have heard of, but that will not serve your turn, neither;
unless you may see with your own eyes, ye will not believe: Nay, you have (at
least many of you) seen my miracles your selves, yet will not that serve
neither; but unless you may see signs and wonders, that is, miracles of all
sorts, many miracles, ye will not believe. So that we have in this reproof
that our Savior gives to this great man, four principal points to be
observed: First, that the infidelity of the Jews is the only sin that
Christ here reproves in them, that alone had power to restrain him from
yielding to this Ruler that help that he desired of him, when he besought him
to come down and heal his son; Christ returns him this answer, You believe
not, you have no faith. As if he should say, I can do you no good, unless you
did believe in me. Secondly, the argument whereby Christ conuinceth the Jews
of infidelity, and proves them to have no true faith; which is this, because,
except they might see signs and wonders they could not be lieue. Thirdly, that
Christ aggrauateth the infidelity of the Jews by their obstinacy in it, Except
ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. Fourthly, that though this was
the sin (not of this Ruler only, but) of all the Jews, common to him, with
his whole Nation; yet Christ counts that no excuse to his sin, but checks and
rebukes him for it nevertheless; nay, he so speaks of it, as it may appear
he hated this sin the more, because it was vitium gentis, and he dislikes him
the more, and judged him the more unworthy to receive help from him, because
he and his nation were guilty of this sin. Therefore purposing to check him
the more sharply, speaking to him alone, he speaks in words of the second
person plural, Except ye see, etc. Now of these four points we will speak in
order. And first, in that Christ speaks here of infidelity, as the chief sin
of the Jews, as of that, that did most provoke God against them, that that did
stop the stream of Gods mercy, and (as it were) dis-enable Christ from doing
the good that he desired: This Doctrine does arise for our instruction.

That no sin offends God so much, as infidelity, when men will not believe
his Word; no sin is such a bar to all Gods mercies, as this. See Doct. 2.
the proof of this Doctrine, both in the examples of wicked men, and of Gods
dear children. For the wicked, we have two famous examples in the Old
Testament, and two other in the New: The first is in the Israelites, that
perished in the wilderness. Many grievous sins they were guilty of; but none
provoked God to wrath so much, none were such bars to Gods mercy toward
them, as their infidelity. When the Lord had said, he would give them such
abundance of flesh, as they should have enough to eat, Number. 11. 18, -- 20. Not
one, or two days, or five, or ten days, or twenty days, but for a whole
month together: they said among themselves, Can God prepare a table in the
wilderness? Can he prepare flesh for his people? Psalm. 78. 19, 20. They did
not (as it may seem by the acknowledgement they made, Verse. 20.) absolutely
deny that, that God had said (as many now adays will do) but only made a
question and doubt of it: but mark what followed, Psalm. 78, 21. Therefore the
Lord heard, and was angry, and the fire was kindled in Jacob, and also wrath
came upon Israel. Why? what was the cause? He had told us before in the
beginning of the 21. Verse. But because he would have us in any case mark this
well, he repeats it again in the 22. Uerse, because they believed not in God,
and trusted not in his help. And whereas God did swear unto their fathers,
that he would give the Land of Canaan to them and their seed after them, Deuteronomy.
1. 8. we shall find that there were but two only (Caleb and Joshua) of all
those that came out of the Land of Egypt, that entered into it. What was the
cause? Surely, they had many sins; they sinned in Idolatry, they sinned in
Whoredom, and many other ways; but of all other sins, that that most
provoked God, that that barred them out of the promised Land, was their
Unbelief: as the Apostle plainly affirms, Heb. 3. 19. So we see they could
not enter in, because of Unbelief. The other example we have of this kind in
the Old Testament, is of a Prince of Israel, a great man under Ioram the King,
of whom we read, 2 King. 7. when he had heard Elisha (whom he knew to be the
Lords Prophet, and to speak from the mouth of the Lord) say (in the time of a
great famine) To morrow this time, a measure of fine flower shall be sold for a
sheckle, and two measures of barley for a sheckle, in the gate of Sa^aria, 2
King. 7. 1. The Prince did not absolutely contradict that, which the Prophet
had said in the Name of the Lord (as many now adays will do) but only doubted
of it, and made a question of it. Though the Lord (said he) should make
windows in the heaven, could this come to pass? 2 Kings 7. 2. But mark what
followed. The Prophet in Gods Name threatened, he should see it (for the
increase of his misery) but he should not eat thereof, Verse 2. and so indeed
it came to pass; for he died a strange and base death: for the people trod
upon him in the gate, and be died, Ver. 20.

The examples we have of this kind in the New Testament, are two: First, the
men of Nazaret, of whom we read, that though Christ desired (out of the love he
bare to the place of his education) to do good among them, yet he could do no
great works there, Mar. 6. 5. viz. It was so much against his revealed will,
that it was impossible even for him. And what was that, that disinabled so the
Almighty Son of God, and so bound (as it were) his hands behind him? Surely,
the Unbelief of the men of Nazaret, as it follows in the next words, Mar. 6.
6. And he marvelled at their Unbelief. And more plainly, Mat. 13. 58. He did
not many great works there, for their Vnbeliefs sake. The other example is of
the Nation and Church of the Jews (though their privileges and prerogatives
were great every way, yet) we know, that when some forty eight years after
Christ, or thereabouts, the wrath of God came on them to the utmost, so as it
did never upon any Nation under heaven, though they were the natural branches
of the Lords Olive, yet did he break them off, and cast them away. And what
was the cause of it? Surely, they were guilty of many heinous sins: but the
Apostle plainly says, the chief cause why God rejected them, was their
Unbelief, because they did not give credit to his Word, Romans 11. 20. Through
Unbelief they were broken off, says he.

So that in these four examples, God has given evident demonstration how much
he abhors this sin, and how it barreth him from showing mercy on men. But
yet this will appear more plainly, if we shall look into some examples of
Gods dear children. I will only name two of them, one in the Old Testament,
and the other in the New. The first is Moses (a man highly in Gods favor,
above all the men in the world) when God had bidden him speak to the rock
before all the people, and promised that it should give forth water in that
abundance, that the whole congregation, and all their cattle should have
enough to drink, Numbers 20. 8. Moses did not absolutely refuse to give credit
to the Word of the Lord, but only doubted, and made a question of it; and that
not so much out of any distrust he had of Gods power and truth, as out of the
conceit he had of the great unworthiness of that wicked people. Numb. 20. 10.
Hear now ye rebels (says he) shall we bring you water out of the rock? But
see how severely God punished his servant Moses for this. For this sin he
shut him out of the Land of Canaan, Numb. 20. 12. Yea, though Moses earnestly
sought to him for it, as we shall find, Deuteronomy. 3. 25. I pray thee, let me go
over, and see the good Land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain of
Lebanon. But the Lord was angry with me (says he) for your sakes, and would
not hear me. And the Lord said unto me, Let it suffice thee, speak no more to
me of this matter.

The last example is Zachary (a man just before God:) when the Lord had
promised him by his Angel, that his wife Elizabeth should bear him a son,
Luke 1. 13. Zachary did but doubt, and make a question of the matter, and said
unto the Angel, whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife is
of great age, Luke 1. 18. But see how sharply God punished his servant Zachary
for this. Though he were a Priest (and such a one, as whose tongue God might
have had more use of, than of many others) yet was he smitten dumb for this,
and so remained full forty weeks. Luke 1. 20. Behold (says the Angel) thou
shall be dumb, till the day that these things be done, because thou belieuedst
not my words.

The Reasons of this Doctrine are two.

As there is nothing wherein we so much give glory to God, as when we Reas. 1.
believe and give credit to his Word: so there is nothing wherein we do so much
derogate from Gods honor, and rob him of his glory, as when we refuse to give
credit to his Word. When we believe whatsoever the Lord has spoken, we do
thereby give him the glory of his truth, his power, his justice, his goodness.
John 3. 33. He that has received his testimony, has sealed, that God is true.
So the Apostle says of Abraham, that when he doubted not of the promise of God
through unbelief, but was strengthened in the faith, he gave glory to God,
Romans 4. 20. On the other side, he that cannot give credit to Gods Word,
dishonors him in the highest degree. 1 John 5. 10. He that belieueth not
God, has made him a liar: and what greater disgrace can ye put upon any man of
worth, than to give him the lie?

The second Reason of the Doctrine is this, Because Infidelity (as it was the
first sin, whereby Satan got entrance into the heart of man, and drew him
from God, Genesis 3. 4.) so is it still the root and mother of all other sins.
Heb. 3. 12. The evil heart is called the heart of Unbelief; there it begins,
that is the first thing that corrupts the heart: As faith is the root and
fountain of all other graces, that is it that purifieth the heart, Act. 15. 9.
If we believe his Word, we cannot choose but love him, fear him, obey him, and
put our trust in him; So on the other side, Infidelity is the fountain of all
ungraciousness, and when once men begin to entertain a doubting of the truth
of any thing God has revealed in his Word, then begins their heart to be
poisoned and corrupted, then begin they to depart from the living* God, and
fall from his fear, and love, and obedience.

Let us now come to the Use of this Doctrine, and we shall find it serves,
first, for exhortation: secondly, for reproof: thirdly, for comfort. First,
Use.
seeing no sin offends God so much as infidelity, no sin is such a bar to
all Gods mercies, no sin has that force to poison and corrupt the heart; we
are therefore all of us to hearken to the exhortation, Take heed, brethren,
lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, Heb. 3. 12. Take heed
of entertaining the least doubt of any truth, that God has clearly revealed
to thee out of the Word. And because, first we are all by nature full of
infidelity, as appears by this, that Christ so often checks his elect
Disciples for this. Matthew. 6. 30. O ye of little Faith. And secondly,
proportionable to the measure of faith, will our fear, and love, and
obedience, and comfort be. Strive therefore by all good means, to obtain an
undoubted certainty of the truth of Gods Word, and to confirm thy heart
against all doubts and infidelity. And four principal means I find that we
are directed to in this case.

1 The consideration of the testimony which the Lord himself has given of the
undoubted certainty of his holy Word, Matthew. 5. 18. Truly, I say unto you,
till heaven and earth perish, one jot or one title of the Law shall not escape,
till all things be fulfilled. Yea, it is a notable thing to observe how precise
God has been in this point, that as it is said of Samuel, 1 Samuel 3. 19. That
God let none of his words fall to the ground: So has he showed himself
careful of the words and writings of all the rest of the Prophets; yea, of the
least jot and title of them, that it might not fall to the ground, but be
fulfilled, Matthew. (...). 18. When the Holy Ghost will give a reason, why
Christ's parents fled with him into Egypt, rather than into any other place,
Mat. 2. 15. And why (after his return) he was brought up at Nazaret, rather
than in any other place, Matthew. 2. 23. Why at his death the soldiers cast lots
for his garments, Matthew. 27. 35. Why when he was crucified, the ungracious
soldiers brake not his legs, according to the custom, but one of them with a
spear pierced his side, John 19. 36, 37. This is only given for the reason of
all, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the mouth of the Prophets,
that the Scripture might be fulfilled. Now consider with thy self, that these
things were but iots and titles in the Writings of the Prophets; and therefore
if God were so careful to see these small things fulfilled, how much more will
he be of the weightier matters of the Law, that concern mercy, and judgment,
and fidelity? Mat. 23. 23.

2 The diligent and conscionable use of Gods ordinance in the Ministry of his
Word and Sacraments. For as Faith comes by hearing, Romans 10. 17. so the
constant use of it is appointed of God to this end, to bring men into certainty
in the matters of their Faith. Ephesians. 4. 14. That we henceforth be no more
children, wavering and carried about with every blast of Doctrine.

3 Fervent and hearty prayer, when our Savior had taught his Disciples a truth
that to flesh and blood seems most incredible; namely, that we are bound to
forgive our brother (upon his repentance) though he wrong us never so often, They
said unto the Lord, increase our faith, Luke 17. 5. For no man can be
undoubtedly assured of the truth of Gods Word, without the revelation of the
Spirit, Flesh and blood has not revealed this unto thee, but my father which
is in heaven, Matthew. 16. 17. Yea it is a mighty work of God. Paul calls it,
Ephesians. 1. 19. the exceeding greatness of his power toward us that believe,
according to the working of his mighty power.

4 An honest heart and care to please God. Mar. 1. 15. Repent and believe the
Gospel. Ioh. 7. 17. If any man shall do his will, he shall know of that
Doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of my self.

The second use is for reproof, and to discover the wretched estate of all
unbelievers: First, if they had no other sin, yet this is enough to make Use
2.
their state miserable: Secondly, how civil soever they seem in show,
doubtless, they are as painted sepulchers: for their heart must needs be
corrupt and naught: Thirdly, neither the power of Christ's merits, nor the
infiniteness of Gods mercy can profit them; but the knowledge they have of the
sufficiency of Christ's merit, and the infiniteness of Gods mercy will but
increase their misery, as in the case of that Prince in 2 King. 7. 2. Behold,
thou shall see it with thine eyes, but shall not eat thereof.

And surely, this is the case of most men, even of such as live in the
Application.
Church, and profess the truth. That that is said of the time, when Christ
shall come to judgment, may be said of these times, When the Son of man
comes, shall he find faith on the earth? Luke 18. 8. This appears by three
apparent signs: First, the contempt of the word of exhortation, in the
Ministry of Gods servants; which, if they believed the Word, they would give
credit unto, Believe in the Lord your God, so shall you be established, believe
his Prophets, so shall ye prosper, 2 Chro. 20. 20. The people believed the Lord
and his servant Moses, Exodus 14. 31.

Object. You cannot agree among your selves; and how should we give credit to
you?

Answ. In matters, the knowledge whereof is necessary to salvation, we all
agree; against thee, and such as thou art, we all agree, Thou art convinced of
us all, thou art judged of us all, 1 Cor. 14. 24. Secondly, the truths they
seem to have received with greatest assurance, yet are they glad to hear
ought objected against them: whereas the contrary is in them that believe, when
occasion of doubting was given unto the two Disciples that went toward Emaus,
that that which they had believed concerning Christ, was not true, it made
their hearts sad, Luke 24. 17. Thirdly, their hearts and lives are utterly
unreformed, which were not possible, if they had true Faith.

Lecture the ninetieth. June 18. 1611. JOHN IIII. XLVIII.
IT follows, that we now proceed to the three other points, that I told you
are to be observed in this Verse. And first, in that our Savior, charging them
with infidelity, does not say simply they would not believe; but says, that
unless they see signs and wonders they would not believe: therefore they had
not Faith: This Doctrine arises, That true Faith is grounded upon the Word of
God, and is able to give credit to the Word, though it see nothing else to
confirm it. They that cannot believe except they see, Doct. 3.
have no true Faith. Before I confirm this Doctrine, I will explain it in
four points:

1 True it is, that the Lord is wont by his works to give testimony to his
Word, and to confirm it: yea, all the mighty works, that God works in his
Church, are done to that end, to ratify his Word, and to gain credit unto it.
Mark 16. ^0. God confirmed the Word with signs that followed. And Acts 14. 3.
God gave testimony to the Word of his grace, and caused signs and wonders to
be done by their hands. Surely, the Lord would not do this, unless he saw it
needful; and if he see it needful, why then does he blame the Jews here for
desiring this? And to this purpose it is, that though the Lord have appointed
the day of general resurrection, to be the day of judgment, Acts 17. 31. Yet
is there never a curse, that he has in his Word denounced against the wicked,
nor blessing he has promised to the godly, but in every age, and in every
place he has made it good upon some, that men may sensibly see his Word
confirmed unto them by his works. Psalm. 7. 11. God judges the righteous, and
him that contemns God every day. In which respect it is said, Psalm. 107. 42.
The righteous shall see it and rejoice, and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.

2 It cannot be denied, but the heart of man may be notably prepared to the
Faith, before his conversion, by many things which he may see: so the miracles
which the Jews saw Christ work, were notable preparatiues unto them, and made
them much more willing to hear and receive his Doctrine, than otherwise they
would have been Of this we have had an example before in the Galileans, Verse
45. So that is to be understood, John 2. 23. Many believed in his Name, when
they saw the miracles which he did: viz. they had received some preparations
unto Faith, they began to conceive reverently of his Doctrine, and were willing
to hear him: and this was all, as appears; Verse 24. But Jesus did not commit
himself to them, because he knew them all. So the good life that they have
seen Gods servants to lead, has been a means to draw many a one to the
Faith. The Apostle uses this as a reason, to persuade Christians to an honest
life, That the Gentiles by their good works which they should behold, might
have cause to glorify God in the day of their visitation, 1 Pet. 2. 12. That
they that obeyed not the Word, might without the word be won by the
conversation of their wives, 1 Pet. 3. 1. So the corrections of God, which they
have seen and felt upon themselves, have been the mean to open many a man's
ear, and to make him willing to hear, Job 33. 16. So the wonderful
deliverances, that men have seen God give to his Church, and overthrows to
the adversaries thereof, have won many a man to the liking of Religion. Hest.
8. 17. Many of the people of the land became Jews: As I nothing doubt, but the
wonderful deliverance God gave us from the Powder Treason, has drawn many a
one from Popery, to the love of the Gospel.

3 It is certain also, that the Faith of the best Christians may be much
confirmed by the works of God which they see. So the Faith of Gods children
was greatly confirmed by the miracles of Christ, and of his Apostles, John 2.
11. This beginning of miracles did Jesus, and showed forth his glory, and his
Disciples believed in him. So are the faithful greatly confirmed by Gods
corrections on themselves, when they are soundly humbled thereby, Job 42. 5. I
have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but no^ine eye sees thee. So by
the sensible experiments they have had of Gods mercy in themselves, they are
greatly confirmed in the Faith of Gods promises. 2 Corinthians. 1. 10. Who has
delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver us, in whom we trust, that
yet hereafter he will deliver us: yea, the beholding of Gods judgments on
wicked men, and his mercies toward his faithful servants, has greatly
confirmed their Faith in the Word of God, when they can say, As we have heard,
so have we seen, Psalm 48. 8. and 58. 10. The righteous shall rejoice, when
they see the vengeance: and why so? Verse 11. And men shall say, Verily, there
is a reward for the righteous; doubtless, there is a God that judges the
earth. And in this respect men ought carefully to mark and observe the works
of God, how God makes good his Word by his works. A principal point this is
of Christian wisdom and piety, and great good might every man receive by it.
Psalm. 107. 43. Who is wise, that he may observe these things? for they shall
understand the loving kindness of the Lord. Yea, say a man be never so
diligent in the reading and hearing of Gods Word; yet if he do not likewise
observe the works of God, he is guilty of a great sin. Psalm. 28. 5. They
regard not the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands: therefore
break them down, and build them not up.

4 It is not simply unlawful, or a sign of infidelity, for a man even to
desire these sensible helps to confirm his Faith. Hezekiah was a true
Belieuer, yet desired a sign, 2 Kings 20. 8. Gedeon was a true Belieuer, yet
he asked a sign of God, Judges 6. 17. And when God had given him one, he asked
another, Verse 38, And when God had given him that, he asked yet another, Verse
39. and God was never a whit offended with him. When a man that does in any
measure truly believe, and give credit to the Word, shall desire that God would
sensibly confirm to him the truth of his promises, by delivering him from any
affliction he is in, by blessing him in his body, in his estate, in his
children, especially by giving him the inward feeling of his favor, he does no
more than he may well do. Psalm. 86. 17. Show a token of thy goodness toward
me, that they which hate me may be ashamed, because thou, O Lord, have helped
me, and comforted me. And Psalm. 90. 16. Let thy works be seen toward thy
servants, and thy glory upon their children.

Now though all this be so, as you have heard in all these four points, yet
remains the Doctrine firm, That true faith is not grounded upon any thing we
see (upon sense and experience) but only upon the Word of God. Whatsoever the
faithful man belieues, he belieues it, because God has said it in his Word.
This the Apostle makes the ground of Abraham's faith, Rom, 4. 18. He believed
that he should be the Father of many Nations, according to that that was spoken
unto him. This was the ground of the Apostles faith (not all the miracles they
had seen) John (...). 22. They believed the Scriptures, and the Word which
Jesus had said. This was the ground of the Ephesians faith, Ephesians. 1. 1^.

2 Insomuch as though there be sundry truths in Gods Word (as I showed you)
which the Lord does use to give us sensible proofs and demonstrations of in
the world; yet he that has true faith, belieues those very things, not so much
for any thing that he sees, as for that he knows God in his Word has said
so. So that he is able to say, I believe, that Goods unjustly gotten, will
certainly come to naught; that Whore-mongers and Adulterers God will judge;
that God will smite through the loins of them that rise against Leui, and of
them that hate him; and that not so much because I see this confirmed in such
and such examples (indeed I believe it the more for this) but not so much for
this, as because God in his Word has said it. Romans 10. 17. Faith comes (not by
sight) but by hearing. 2 Cor. 5. 7. We walk by faith, and not by sight. He that
walks by sight, walks not by faith.

3 The true belieuer gives credit to the Word, though he see nothing to
confirm it. The bare Word of God is of sufficient credit with him, and he
belieues as verily those truths which his sense nor reason can discern any
proof of (such as are all the Articles of our Faith) only for the Words sake,
as he does those truths that are most confirmed unto his sense or reason. Heb.
11. 1. It is the evidence of things not seen. Ioh. 20. 29. Thomas, because
thou have seen me thou belieuest, blessed are they that have not seen, and
have believed. 1 Pet. 1. 8. Whom ye have not seen, and yet ye love him; in
whom now though you see him not, yet do you believe, and rejoice with joy
unspeakable and glorious. As if he should say, You believe nevertheless
assuredly in him, though you did never see him.

4 The true belieuer gives credit to the Word, not only in those truths
wherein he has no help from sense or reason to confirm him, but even where
they are both against him. Romans 4. 18. Abraham against hope (of sense and
reason) believed under hope (of Gods Word) that he should be the Father of many
Nations.

Let us now come to the Use of this Doctrine, and we shall find it serves, Use.
first, for instruction: secondly, for reproof: thirdly, for comfort.

First, for instruction to the Teacher: secondly, to the Hearer. 1 To us that
are teachers, since our Ministry is ordained to bring men to Faith, and there is
no other means else ordained to that end, Romans 10. 17. and faith is grounded
only upon the Word; that therefore our chief care should be to bring good
evidence from the Word, for every thing that we teach. Mar. 4. 14. The sower
sows the word, that is the only seed of grace. 2 Timothy 4. 2. Teach the Word,
improve, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering, and Doctrine.

2 This serves for the instruction of the Hearers, seeing the excellency and
happiness of a Christian consists in his Faith. (By faith we are justified
in Gods sight, and have peace toward God, Romans 5. 1. By Faith we are
sanctified, Acts 15. 9. By Faith we stand and persevere in the state of grace,
Thou stand by faith, Romans 11. 20. By Faith we quench all the fiery darts of
the Devil, Ephesians. 6. 16.) And this faith is grounded only upon the Word of
God. We are therefore to be exhorted to seek good ground in the Word, for that
that we hold in Religion; and therefore both to acquaint our selves with it in
private, and in frequenting the public Ministry thereof, to hear with
judgment, and to mark well, how that that is taught us is grounded upon the
Word. Every Christian should esteem it a singular favor of God, that we may
have his Word in our houses to read on when we will, and a foul sin not to
make our use of it: This God complains of as of a foul sin, I have written
unto them the great things of my Law, and they were counted as a strange thing,
that did not belong unto them, that they had nothing to do withal, Hos. 8. 12.
And the Prophet, describing unto us the man that shall be saved, describes him
by this, Psalm. 1. 2. that his delight is in the Law of God. Every man will
grant, that there is no hope a man should come to happiness, unless he be
such a one as is described, Psalm. 1. and such a one thou can not be, till
thou can delight in Gods Word.

So likewise when we frequent the Ministry of the word, we should learn to
hear with judgment, and not so much to regard the zeal or utterance of our
Teachers, as to mark well, how they ground that that they teach upon the Word
of God. Phil. 1. 9. This I pray (says Paul) that your love may abound, yet
more and more in knowledge, and in all judgment. For this those Noblemen of
Berea are commended, Acts 17. 11, 12. They searched the Scriptures daily,
whether those things were so. Therefore many of them believed.

The second Use of this Doctrine, is for reproof and terror of carnal men.
He that wants faith, it is impossible for him to please God, Heb. 11. 6. 2.
but the wrath of God abides on him, John 3. 36. And by this Doctrine it is
evident, the most men want true faith, because the faith they seem to have, is
grounded (not upon the Word of God, but) only upon sense, they believe no
farther than they see.

This shall appear evidently in three Points.

1. The faith they have is grounded, not upon Gods Word, but upon sense. Those
truths that they see generally received, and allowed of by men, those they are
content to hold; but those truths that are rejected by men, (though they have
never so good a ground in Gods Word) yet they cannot believe. I might instance
this in sundry particulars, if time would permit. Whereas, he, whose Faith is
grounded upon Gods Word, likes never the worse of any truth God has revealed
to him, because he sees it rejected by men: but even as it is in other cases;
(This is the trial of our love to men, Pro. 17. 17. A friend loves at all
times, and a brother is borne for adversity) so it is in this, It is time for
thee Lord to work, for they have made void thy Law; therefore love I thy
commandments above gold, yea above fine gold, therefore I esteem all thy
precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate eve ry false way, Psalm.
119. 126, 127, 128. He that indeed loves Gods truth, will love it the more,
because it is rejected by the world.

2 The faith they have in Gods justice is grounded, not upon the Word of God,
but upon sense only. When the heavy hand of God is upon them in some
judgment, they can believe indeed he is justly offended with them for their
sins. When they hear the terrible thunder, and see the lightening, they can
tremble before the Lord: but so soon as this is past, they cast off all fear
of God; nothing that they hear spoken out of Gods Word against their sins,
can move them one whit. Whereas the true belieuer, that grounds his faith upon
Gods Word, has the fear of God in him at all times, Blessed is the man that
fears always, Pro. 28. 14. and is much more assured of Gods justice and hatred
against sin, by that that he has learned out of Gods Word, than by any thing
he can see or feel, They tremble at the word, Esa. 66. 2. So Noah being warned
of God concerning things not seen, (though himself was expressly exempted from
the judgment) yet was moved with fear, Heb. 11. 7. For this the Nineuites are
commended, Jonah 3. 4, 5. By the preaching of Ionab they were brought to that
fear and humiliation, though they saw not, nor felt any thing that might cause
them to fear.

3 The Faith that the carnal man has in Christ, and persuasion of Gods mercy,
is not grounded upon the Word, but upon sense only: he is indeed often very
confident of Gods favor, both for the present, and for the time to come, he
says to his soul, Eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry
heart, for God now accepts thy works, Eccles. 9. 7. But what is the ground of
his assurance? He says, he sees Gods love, and feels it daily, The judgments
of God are far above out of his sight, Psalm. 10. 5. But alas, this will be
found a false ground. Eccles. 9. 2. No man knows either love or hatred, of
that that is before them. Whereas the child of God is assured of Gods favor
for the present and the time to come, by that which he hears and reads in the
Word; though he see or feel little to persuade him to it, yet he has the
promise, Godliness has the promise both of this life and of the life to come:
this is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptance, for therefore we
labor and suffer reproach because (upon this ground) we trust in the living
God, etc. 1 Timothy 4. 8, 9, 10. And this promise is of great force and
account with him, Having these promises, let us cleanse our selves, 2 Corinthians.
7. 1.

The third Use of the Doctrine is for comfort to the godly, that know they
fear God unfeignedly, and yet are often perplexed, because all sensible tokens
3.
of his favor, both inward and outward, are taken from them.

First, in thy outward affliction and distress, acquaint thy self well with
Gods promises made unto thee, namely such as that, they that seek the Lord
shall not want any good thing, Psalm 34. 10. Secondly, assure thy self, God
withholds from thee the sensible performance of them, to prove whether thou
can believe though thou see not, To humble thee, and to prove thee, and to
know what was in thy heart, whether thou would keep his commandments or no,
Deuteronomy. 8. 2. Thirdly, give thou glory to God in believing, and say as Job 13.
15. Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him. And all will be well assuredly,
If thou can believe, all things are possible to him that belieueth, Mark. 9.
23.

In the affliction of thy mind, and loss of the feeling of Gods favor, first,
acquaint thy self with the promises: Whom Christ ever loved, he loves to the
end, Ioh. 13. 2. The gifts and callings of God (such gifts and graces of God as
do accompany an effectual calling) are without repentance, Romans 11. 29. He
has said, I will never fail thee, nor forsake thee, Heb. 13. 5. Secondly,
rest assured, God does this for thy profit, he always chasteneth us for our
profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness, Heb. 12. 10. Thirdly,
consider not too much of, nor reason too much with thy temptation, Abraham
considered not (thought not much upon, nor reasoned with, or objected against
the promise of God) his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred year
old, neither yet the deadness of Sarahs womb, Romans 4. 19. Fourthly, though
thou feel nothing, yet say with David, Psalm. 56. 10. In God will I praise his
word, in the Lord will I praise his word.

Lecture the ninety one. June 25. JOHN IIII. XLVIII.
IT remains now, that we proceed to the two last points observed in this
Verse. The first thing then that we are now to observe, is this, That our
Savior charge the Jews with obstinacy, and aggrauates their infidelity by
their wilfulness: Ye will not believe, says he. And this ye shall find often
charged upon them, and made the chief cause of their reiection. John 5. 40.
But ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. And 8. 44. Ye are of your
father the Devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. Matthew. 23. 37.
How often would I have gathered you together, as an Hen gathers her chickens
under her wings, but ye would not. Romans 11. 25. Obstinacy is come to Israel,
until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in. They had had all good means to
persuade them to believe in Christ: the Scriptures did bear witness unto him,
and so did the Shepherds, and Simeon, and Anna, and John the Baptist, and the
miracles that Christ himself had wrought; therefore it must needs be
wilfulness and obstinacy in them, that they did not believe. From hence then
this Doctrine arises, That this greatly aggrauateth every Doct. 4.
sin in the sight of God, when it is committed with wilfulness and
obstinacy. When men sin, not of simple ignorance, but (God having given them
the ordinary means of knowledge, and faith, and reformation of life) they
stand out against the means, and will not be reclaimed.

Observe the proof and demonstration of this Doctrine in all the ways,
whereby the wrath of God is revealed from heaven, and ye shall ever find, he
hates the man that sins wilfully against the means, above all other. First,
in the everlasting punishment and torments of Hell. Though Turks and Pagans,
that never sinned wilfully against the means of grace, shall be damned: and
therefore it is said, Mar. 16. 16. He that belieueth not (not he that will not
believe)* (...), shall be damned. And 2 These. 1. 8 In flaming fire rendering
vengeance on them that do not know God. And Romans 2. 12. As many as have sinned
without the Law, shall perish also without the Law: yet shall there be
certainly in those everlasting torments (the least measure whereof shall be
such, as no heart of man is able to conceive; and because the least shall be
vnconceaueably extreme, and everlasting, it passes man's reason to imagine how
there should be any degrees in it) great odds and difference. And the Lord (who
is infinite in wisdom, and justice, and power) has appointed far more
grievous, and fearful torments in that Lake, for them that have sinned
wilfully and obstinately against the means, than for any other sinner. This is
plain by that speech of our Savior, Matthew. 10. 15. of every City that
refuses the Word, Truly, I say unto you, it shall be easier for them in the
land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that City. And of
Capernaum, that (did not refuse to hear, but) did wilfully refuse to believe,
and obey the truth which they heard, Matthew. 11. 24. I say unto you, it shall be
easier for the Land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee. And that
of the Apostle, Romans 2. 8, 9. Indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish,
shall be upon the soul of every man that does evil, of the Jew first, and
also of the Grecian. And why of the Jew first, or chiefly? Because (as I have
showed you) obstinacy is come upon Israel; their obstinacy against the means
of grace, which they had above the Grecian, is the cause of it. 2. In those
corporal and temporal plagues that God is wont to bring upon men in this
life, God shows this also evidently, in those he inflicteth upon wicked men in
their bodies, and goods, and good name, in their children and posterity. For,
first, though God in this life show wonderful patience, in bearing with
sinners; yet some he cannot forbear, till the life to come: but (James 1. 15.)
sin, when it is finished, brings forth death. And the thing that makes up
the measure and perfection of sin, is this, when men grow obstinate in sin,
and will not be reclaimed. Thus says Daniel to Belthasar, of the King his
Father, Dan. 5. 20. When his heart was puffed up, and his mind was hardened in
pride, he was deposed from his Kingly Throne, and his heart was made like the
beasts. And this is so certain a sign, that some judgment or other is near
unto a man, when his heart is thus hardened, and grown obstinate in pride, or
in drunkenness, or in uncleanness, or in oppression, or in any other sin;
that the Prophet tells Amazia to his face, 2 Chronicles. 25. 16. He knew by that,
that God had determined to destroy him; as you shall find he did indeed, ver.
27. And though the Jews had many grievous sins, yet you shall find there
never came any strange and common judgments upon them, till they grew to this.
Dan. 9. 6. We would not obey thy servants the Prophets, which spoke unto us in
the Name of the Lord. Verse 11. Therefore the curse is powered upon us.
Secondly, God never is so fierce and terrible in his temporal judgments
against any sinners, as against those that have enjoyed the best means, and
obstinately neglected and rebelled against them, God is very terrible in the
assembly of his Saints, Psalm. 89. 7. Under the whole heaven it has not been
done, as has been done unto Jerusalem, Dan 9. 12. Wrath is come upon them
unto the uttermost, 1 Thessalonians. 2. 16. Thirdly, and principally, in Gods
spiritual judgments we may discern this: 1. Such as wilfully refuse to
receive and embrace the truth, when it is revealed unto them, God is wont to
take their judgment and understanding from them, hearing you shall hear, and
shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive, for
this people have closed their own eyes, Matt. 13. 14, 15. Because they
received not the love of the truth that they might be saved, for this cause God
shall send them strong delusion, 2 Thessalonians. 2 10, 11. 2. Such as use obstinately
to sin against their conscience, God is wont to give them up to a reprobate
mind, and unto beastly and vile affections. Marvel not therefore to see such
as have had the best means (if they prove bad) to become of all bad men the
most profane and ungracious: if you see children of most godly parents, people
that have lived under most faithful Pastors, prove such, wonder not. It is
said of Manasse, the son of Hezekiah, that he wrought more wickedly, than all
the Amorit^s that had been before him, 2. Kings 21. 11. 3. God has threatened
against some sinners that he will never comfort them, nor show mercy on them,
and consequently not give them grace to repent; which is the grieuousest plague
of all plagues, the Lord will not spare that man, but the anger of the Lord and
his i^alousie shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are
written in this book shall lie upon him, Deuteronomy. 29. 20. And the cause hereof
you shall find in the former verse to be the presumption and obstinacy in
sinning that was in that man. See this in Pharaoh, Exodus 9. 12. the Lord
hardened his heart that he could not repent. But what was the cause? Exodus 8.
15. 19 32. He had hardened his own heart, and wilfully refused to hearken to
the message that was brought him from God, or to be humbled and moved with his
judgments.

The Reasons of the Doctrine are two. Reason.


1. This obstinacy in sin, argues that sin has the full possession of the
heart, and that men love it unfeignedly; and that is one cause why God hates it
so much. Psalm. 11. 5. The wicked, and him that loves iniquity does his soul
hate. And 66. 18. If I regard wickedness in my heart, the Lord will not hear
me. Our sins are then become our idols and gods, these men have set up their
idols in their hearts, Ezekiel. 14. 3. when we give divine honor unto them.

2. It argues a rebellion and proud contempt of God, when men will not be
reclaimed by his Word. Job 34. 37. He adds rebellion unto his sin. And 1.
Sam. 15. 23. Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft. Yea, this obstinacy will
bring the heart by little and little into that impardonable sin, that is
committed in mere malice against God. Therefore when the nature of that sin
is described, it is called a sinning wilfully, Heb. 10. 26. And David, Psalm.
19. 13. speaks of presumptuous sin as of the next step to the great
transgression.

The Use of this Doctrine is both for Exhortation, and for Reproof, and for
Comfort also.

We are all to be Exhorted by this Doctrine, to take heed of obstinacy in Use.
1.
any sin, and to count it a great favor and grace of God (which we should
pray for, and by all means labor to attain unto, viz.) to have tractable and
teachable hearts. This is made a note of Gods Elect, to receive the Word
gladly, Acts 2. 41. and with all readiness of mind, Acts 17. 11. Four notes
we may try this by: 1. When in going to hear the word we go with an open
heart, willing to learn whatsoever God shall teach us. Acts 10 33. We are all
here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God. 2.
When our reason is so captiuated unto God, that we dare not dispute, nor cavil
against any truth God has clearly revealed unto us in his Word, seem it
never so contrary to our reason and affections. Job 6. 24. Teach me and I will
hold my tongue, and cause me to understand wherein I have erred: as if he should
say, Reveal to me by thy Word, any thing wherein I have offended thee, and I
will lay my hand upon my mouth, I will not dare to reason in the defense of it.
3. When we are ready to receive Gods Word, and be informed in his will, by any,
how much soever he be our inferior; when we dare not reject good counsel and
admo^ition from any. Esaias 11. 6. A little child shall lead them. 4. When the
Lord having revealed his will unto us by any means, we show an earnest care
and endeavor to obey it, Psalm. 119. 34. Give me understanding, and I will
keep thy Law, yea I will keep it with my whole heart.

For Reproof and terror of all wicked men that live in these days of 2.
light, Esaias 33. 14. The sinners in Sion are afraid, says the Prophet. And
indeed, no sinners under heaven have so much cause to fear, as the sinners in
Sion have; they that have enjoyed the best means. They cannot pretend
ignorance, for excuse of their sins; all their sins will be judged to be done
obstinately and wilfully.

But two special sorts of sinners are reproved here: First, such as are
wilful and obstinate against the knowledge of the truth: Secondly, such as are
obstinate and wilful against the practice and obedience of the truth. Two
sorts there be of them, that will not know the truth: as first, they that
refuse to hear, because they think their ignorance will be some advantage to
them; their conscience will be the quieter for it. And these are like Felix,
Acts 24. 26. who, when he felt his conscience awakened and troubled by Paul's
Ministry, would hear him no longer. But alas, this will be no advantage to
them: for first, there is light enough in them by nature to condemn them,
though they never hear Sermon, as many as have sinned without the Law, shall
also perish without the Law, Romans 2. 12. Secondly, the knowledge of the Word
will not work unquietness, but peace in the heart of them that do obey it,
learn of me -- and ye shall find rest to your souls, Matthew. 11. 29.
Thirdly, wilful ignorance shall no way lessen, but increase thy condemnation.
The Apostle, 2. Pet. 3. 5. speaking of Atheists and Mockers, says, This they
willingly know not. Mat. 10. 15. It shall be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah,
than for them that will not hear.

The second sort of them that will not know the truth, are they that can be
content to hear, but yet will not be persuaded of many truths, that have often
been clearly taught them out of Gods Word. They cannot be persuaded, that
preaching is the only ordinary means of salvation; that we must so precisely
rest from our own labors upon the Sabbath; that a man is bound to frequent
every part of Gods worship, both in Church and house; that every master of a
family is charged with the souls of his whole family, and shall answer for the
sins that are committed in it. These men I would have to weigh, first, that
it is spoken to the praise of many, and noted as a mark of Gods Elect, to
receive the Word with all readiness, Acts 17. 11. and the very entrance of
Gods Word gives light unto them, Psalm. 119. 130. And the contrary is noted by
the Holy Ghost to the dispraise of men, that they were long ere they could
believe, o fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have
spoken, Luke 24. 25. yea, it is spoken of as a mark of a reprobate, you
therefore hear not (believe not, obey not) because ye are not of God, Ioh. 8.
47. if our Gospel be hidden, it is hidden to them that are lost, 2. Cor. 4. 3.
Consider the true causes of it, and they are said to be three: First, the
badnesse and ungraciousness of the heart, women laden with sins and led away
with diverse lusts, are ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of
the truth, 2. Tim. 3. 7. Secondly, the special work of Satan, the god of
this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not, 2. Cor. 4. 4.
Thirdly, the just judgment of God upon thine own wilfulness, as we heard
before out of Matthew. 13. 14, 15. Remember the Doctrine, and take heed of
sinning wilfully.

The second sort, that I told you were to be reproved by this Doctrine, are
such as are wilful and obstinate against the practice and obedience of the
truth: and of them there are three sorts: First, such as will not obey the
truth, when they see it, but glory in this, that they can give us the hearing,
and yet are not such fools as to be ruled by us, they said we will not walk
therein, Ier. 6. 16. as for the word which thou bast spoken to us in the name
of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee, Ier. 44. 16. Secondly, such as will
not endure particular admonition, be it private or public. Thirdly, such as
will be the worse for admonition, sin taking occasion by the Commandment,
Romans 7. 8. And such (for the most part) are our youths, whose outrages are
usually committed in an opposition, and contempt to the Word: but let them
remember, these youthful sins will be heavy and bitter one day, thou writest
bitter things against me, and make me to possess the iniquities (the
punishment of the sins) of my youth. Job 12. 26.

The third Use of this Doctrine, is for the comfort of the faithful, who
(though they have many corruptions, yet they) are able to say, that to will 3.
is present with them; their will, and the desire of their heart, is set to
please the Lord, Romans 7. 18. 20.

Lecture the ninety two. July 2. 1611. JOHN IIII. XLVIII.
IT follows now, that we come to the fourth and last point, that I have told
you is to be observed in this verse: in which (that we may the better receive
our instruction from it) these things are to be marked: First, our Savior
charge the whole Nation of the Jews with this sin of infidelity, and
says, that this was the common fault of all the Jews of that age; they would
not believe, except they saw signs and wonders. Matthew. 12. 29. An evil and
adulterous generation seeks a sign. 1. Cor. 1. 22. The Jews require a
sign. Secondly, that our Savior, purposing to reprove this Ruler for his
infidelity, and to humble him, and to show him, that for that cause he was
unworthy to receive help from him, does not say, Except thou see, etc. but in
the plural number, Except ye see: as if he should say, If this were thy sin
only, I could the better bear with it, but it is the sin of you all: and
this he speaks, not to extenuate his sin, but to humble him the more. Hence
then this Doctrine arises:

That the commonnesse of any sin, is no excuse for sin. No man has cause
to make the less account of any sin that he lives in, because he sees Doct.
5.
it is common, and grown into fashion; but to fear it the more, to be humbled
the more for it, because of that. A plain proof of the Doctrine we have,
Leuit. 4. from verse 13. to 35. where the Lord (prescribing a form, how
atonement should be made for all sorts that had sinned of ignorance, he)
requires more solemnity to be used, and more to be done, for the expiation of a
sin, that a whole Congregation is guilty of, than either for the sin of any
Magistrate, or for the sin of any private man whatsoever.

The Reason of the Doctrine is this, That the more common sin is, the more
God hates it, and the less can he bear with it. The more there be Reason.
that do conspire in sin, the more fierce will Gods wrath be upon them.
Nothing hastens Gods vengeance upon sinners more than this: as the generality
of repentance, and joining together in the profession of it, is of great force
to stay Gods wrath; as we may see in two famous examples, namely in the fast
that Israel kept for success against the Beniamites, and in that of the
Niuites, Judge. 20. 6. and Jonah 3. 5. so is the generality of sin of great
force, to hasten and increase the judgments of God. See the proof of this in
three famous examples of Gods vengeance upon sinners. First, in the destruction
of the old World; mark the story, and you shall find, that the generality of
sin then, brought that general flood. Genesis 6. 12. Then God looked upon the
earth, and behold, it was corrupt: for all flesh had corrupted his way upon
earth. And verse 11. The earth was filled with cruelty. The second example is
in the destruction of Sodom: of that the Lord says, Genesis 18. 20. The cry of
Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and their sin exceeding grievous. But what made
the cry of their sin so great? Look Genesis 19. 4. and ye shall find it was
this; The men of Sodom compassed Lots house from the young even to the old, all
the people even from all quarters, they were all corrupted with that beastly
filthynesse, they did all burn with that lust. The third example is that of
the captivity in Babylon; before it fell out (when the causes of it are laid
down by the Prophets) nothing is so much stood upon, as this, that all sorts
and conditions of Gods people had corrupted themselves. See this in Ier. 5. 7.
How should I spare thee for this? And verse 9. Shall not I visit for these
things, says the Lord? shall not my soul be avenged on such a Nation as this?
Why? What was the cause? verse 7. They assemble themselves by companies in
Harlots houses. And verse 8. Every man neighed after his neighbors wife.
Adultery was grown to be the sin, not of a few, but of all sorts. See this
also, the children gather the wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the
women knead the dough to make cakes to the Queen of heaven, etc. Ier. 7. 18.
20. A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my Covenant --
therefore behold I will bring evil upon them, etc. Ier. 11. 9 -- 11. The like
complaint we shall find, Ezekiel. 22. 6. Behold, the Princes of Israel, every one
in thee, was ready to his power to shed blood. And verse 11. Every one has
committed abomination with his neighbors wife, and every one has wickedly
defiled his daughter in law, and in thee has every one forced his own sister,
even his fathers daughter. And after the captivity was come, you shall see it
was imputed to this chiefly. Dan. 9. 11. Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy.
Law, and have turned back, and have not heard thy voice; therefore the curse
is poured upon us. In all these examples we see, that whiles sin kept it
self within any bounds, the Lord did forbear to bring these common and
general calamities upon men; but when (like a flood) it ouerflowed the banks,
and ran over all, then could God forbear no longer.

The first Use of this Doctrine is for Reproof: most men count this a
sufficient Use 1.
excuse, and defense for any thing they hold, or for any thing they do, that
they are not alone; they hold as most men do, and do as most men do; they
make the example of men, the rule of their conscience: First, the good things
they do, they do upon no other ground, but because it is the custom; they
hold this Religion to be the truth, they keep the Sabbath, they come to Church
only upon this ground. All men do so, even the wisest men we know; they Faith
stands in the wisdom of men, as the Apostle speaks, 1. Cor. 2. 5. Secondly,
let all the Preachers in the world speak never so much against some sins (as
the resting upon a dumb Ministry, the superstitious observations of many
Popish customs, giving and answering of challenges, following the newest
fashions, the immodesty of women in their apparel and attire) yet will they
not be persuaded that these are sins, only because they are so general, and
in fashion every where. In this point our people are like those we read of,
Ier. 44. 17. We will burn incense to the Queen of heaven: And why so? We have
done so, both we and our fathers, our Kings and our Princes, in the Cities of
Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem. Thirdly, let us out of Gods Word never
so clearly prove the necessity of sundry duties (as to have prayer in our
families, etc.) yet can they not be persuaded to it: And why? I pray you, who
does so? a few precise fools, whom every body derides. John 7. 48, 49. Do any
of the Rulers and Pharisees beleene in him? but this people that know not the
Law are cursed. Fourthly, in such things, as they know to be sins (as
swearing, whoredom, drunkenness, etc.) they bless, and secure, and quiet
their consciences by this, that they are not alone. Ezekiel. 16. 54. Thou have
comforted them of Sodom, says God to the Jews. And who is not in some degree
or other guilty of this corruption? I will therefore give you some remedies
against it out of Gods Word:

1. Consider that we have just cause to suspect, that that way which the most
men take, is not the right way; that if we do as the most do, surely we do
not well. Matthew. 7. 13, 14. It is the broad way that leads to destruction,
and many there be that go in thereat: but the gate is strait, and the way
narrow, that leads unto life, and few there be that find it. The most have
ever swarued from the right way; yea, even the most of them, that have
professed the true Religion, many are called, but few are chosen, Matthew. 22.
14. Christ's true flock has ever been a little flock, Luke 12. 32. Therefore
Christ has a strange speech, Luke 6. 26. Woe be to you, when all men speak
well of you.

2. If we do swerue from the right way, and sin against God, it will not
avail us to have all the men in the world on our mind, or to take our part:
they cannot plead for us. 1. Sam. 2. 25. If a man sin against the Lord, who
will plead for him? Those which by their example or otherwise, have drawn us
to sin, will be far enough from pitying, or speaking a word for us, when God
shall call us to judgment. What comfort can the companions of wicked men yield
to them, when they are on their deathbed? Surely, as much as the Priests and
Elders did to Judas, when they had drawn him to betray his Master, when he (in
the anguish of his soul) cried to them, Mat. 27. 4. I have sinned, in
betraying the innocent blood They say, What is that to us? see thou to it. But
(say they were willing to take our part) alas, they can do us no good, when God
shall call us unto an account, they cannot shroud us from Gods wrath. Earthly
Princes are feign often to spare malefactors, because they are too strong, and
have many to join with them: as David did Ioab, 2. Sam. 3. 39. But the Lord
will not do so. Pro. 11. 21. Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not
go unpunished. What is the example of the whole world, to stand against God?
It Is as easy for him to destroy a whole world of men, as one man, behold the
nations are as the drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the
balance; behold he takes up the isles as a very little thing. All nations
before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less then nothing and
vanity, Esaias 40. 15. 17. Yea (as we have heard in the Doctrine) he is so much
the more ready to execute vengeance upon any sin, the more common it is, the
more there be that join in it; as in the example of the old World and Sodom,
it has appeared. At the day of judgment, thou that art an adulterer, a
drunkard, a swearer, etc. shall see all that have been of thy fashion gathered
together; then thou shall have company enough, thou shall then be able to say,
thou art not alone: but a las, that shall yield thee no comfort at all. But in
that day, thou shall find that true, which the Prophet says in another case,
Esaias 44. 11. Behold, all that are of the fellowship thereof shall be
confounded, -- let them all be gathered together and stand up. yet they shall
fear, and be confounded together. Yea (howsoever many desperate sinners are
wont to jest at Hell, and say they had rather be there, than in Heaven; for
there will be most good fellows to bear them company, yet) they shall find
one day, that that will be no mitigation at all to their torment, but the more
of their companions and fellows that they shall have with them there, the more
extreme and intolerable shall their pains be. And that may seem to be the
only cause, why Dives was so importunate with Abraham, that Lazarus might go to
keep his brethren from that place of torment, Luke 16. 28. So that it stands
every one upon, to hearken to the exhortation of the Apostle, Gal. 6. 4, 5.
Seek to have matter of rejoicing in thy self alone, and not in another: for
every man shall bear his own burden.

The third remedy against this corruption, is, to consider that it is not safe
3.
to make the example of any, no not of the best man, the rule of our
conscience. That honor is due only to Gods Word: The example even of the best
man, may deceive and mis-leade us. So did the example of the old Prophet
deceive the young Prophet, 1. Kings 13. 19. So did Peter's example deceive
Barnabas, and many others, Gal. 2. 13. So that we cannot be sure we do well, if
we have no better ground. Yea, it is a most high dishonor done to God, to make
any man's example the rule of their conscience. Ier. 17. 5. Cursed be the man
that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, and withdraws his heart from
the Lord.

The second Use of this Doctrine is for instruction and direction unto us all,
Use 2.
how to carry our selves in these evil times, wherein most foul finnes are
grown exceeding common and general, and do ouerflow all places, all sorts,
and conditions of men. This is the general complaint of all men, that sin was
never so rife, never so common, as it is now. Profaneness and contempt of
Religion, swearing, drunkenness, unmercifulness, murder, falsehood, and
security. They that go into places of most common resort, as to Faires, and
Assizes, and observe the behavior of men, would wonder at Gods patience, and
think there were not a godly man left in the Land, as the Prophet complained
in his time, Psalm. 12. 1. Well, let us learn what is our duty to do that live
in such an age; specially theirs, that live in the worst places. Four duties
especially I find enjoined to Gods people in such an age. 1. We should take
this for a sign of Gods vengeance approaching; this should work in us fear
and humiliation. It is made the property of a wise hearted Christian, Pro. 22.
3. To see the plague, and hide himself, to observe the signs of a judgment
coming. As God has given us signs to discern a tempest, so has he of his
judgments. And the Lord blames his people, Ier. 8. 7. for that they had less
sense and wisdom, to discern the approaching of his judgments, than the
Storke, and Turtle, and Crane, and Swallow had, to discern their appointed
times. Now this is one of our signs, that judgment is near, when sin is
grown so rife and general, as I have showed in the Doctrine. Certainly, when
a godly man considers of it, it will work fear and sorrow in him. Psalm. 119.
53. Fear is come upon me, for the wicked that forsake thy Law. Thus the
Prophet brings in himself, and all the godly, mourning and complaining, Micah
7. 1. Woe is me, for I am as when they have gathered summer fruits, -- there is
no cluster to eat. Mark one reason, verse. 2 -- 6. viz. the generality of sin:
And another, verse 4. the approaching of judgment. He that is thus affected
with this generality of sin, shall find comfort in the evil day, and none but
he, set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all
the abominations that be done in the midst thereof, Ezekiel. 9. 4.

If any shall object, This needs not trouble us, neither is this such a
certain Object.
sign of judgment approaching; for though sin were never so rife as now, yet
did our Land never enjoy more sign of Gods favor, nor more likelihood of the
con^inuance thereof, than now. Some twenty years since, when sin was nothing
so common, yet were there more signs of Gods wrath toward the Land, than now.

I answer: 1. Judgment may be at hand notwithstanding all this, that we Answ.
boast of. Genesis 19. 23. It was a fair sunshine morning when Lot entered into
Zoar, yet that very day fire and brimstone came from heaven upon Sodom. And
our general security (that we cannot see, nor feel any tokens of Gods anger)
is one of the fearfullest signs that can be, that judgment is at hand, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 3. When they shall say peace and safety, then destruction shall ceaze
upon them. 2. I will tell you the true causes, why God has spared us all this
while, and does spare us still, though sin so abound; and it is good every one
of us should take notice of them, that we may not call Gods truth and justice
into question: 1. The Gospel, and the true Religion of God is soundly
preached, and professed still in the Land. It Is true, sundry faithful Prophets
of God are much maligned, and sundry dangerous errors are broached and taught
by some men; yet for the substance, the true Religion and Worship of God
(blessed be God) we still enjoy it in a comfortable manner, yea in greater
sincerity and power than any other Church under heaven does; and that with
public allowance, and countenance of Authority. And this is one chief cause,
why God spares us. 1. Chron. 13. 14. While the Arc remained in the house of
Obededom, God blessed Obededom, and all his household. This the Prophet uses as
a most effectual reason to move the Lord unto mercy toward Judah, Ier. 14. 9.
Yet thou. O Lord, art in the midst of us, and thy Name is called upon us,
forsake us not. and Ezekiel. 20. 8. I thought to pour out mine indignation upon
them, and accomplish my wrath against them: but I had respect to my Name, that
it should not be polluted before the Heathen. 2. God has still a great people
in the Land, that fear him unfeignedly. It is true, that in many places he has
not so many as he has had, their numbers decrease very sensibly in sundry
places; yet has he still a great people in the Land. And this is another
chief cause, why the Lord spares the Land: Gods people are a blessing unto it,
thou shall be a blessing, Genesis 12. 2. As bad as Potiphars house was, Genesis 39.
5. The Lord blessed it for Joseph's sake, and the blessing of the Lord was upon
all that he had in the house, and in the field. Yea, as bad as Sodom was, if
there had been but ten righteous men in it, they had saved it, Genesis 18. 32. And
certainly of our Land it may be said, that neither the wisdom of our
Counselors, nor the valor of our Soldiers; but as Job 22. 30. The innocent
have delivered the Island, and it has been preserved by the pureness of their
hand. 3. There be many of Gods faithful servants that pray unto him fervently
day and night, and so stand in the gap, to keep out Gods judgments from the
Land. It is true, fasting and prayer is not so much in use as of old it was:
yet still is it used by many: and this has great force to keep away Gods
judgments. Psalm. 106. 23. The Lord minded to destroy them, had not Moses his
chosen stood in the breach, to turn away his wrath. and Exodus 32. 10. the Lord
says unto Moses, Let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them.

1. Every man the more he sees iniquity to abound, the more fervent should he
be with God in prayer, that so he may be one of those that stand in the gap, to
turn away his wrath. The increase of sin in the land should increase our
feruency in prayer. So did it in Moses, Exodus 32. 11. and Number. 16. 4. And this
the Lord looks for at the hand of all his people. Esaias 59. 16. When he saw
there was no man, he wondered that none would offer himself, Ezekiel. 22. 30. I
sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap
before me for the Land, that I might not destroy it; but I found none. And this
is the first thing we must do in such evil times.

2. Take so much the more heed to thy self, that thou be not plucked away
with the common error, 2. Pet. 3. 17. and that thy heart be not by little and
little drawn to the liking of sin. This is pure religion indeed to keep our
selves unspotted from the world, Iam. 1. 27. For it is a marvelous hard thing
for a man not to receive infection where sin is common. Experience shows how
hard it is for a man (that lives where swearing and drunkenness, or filthy
talk, or Sabbath breaking are in continual use) to keep his heart in the
detestation of those sins. Yea men shall be apt to think a sin to be no sin,
when he sees it to be in general use. See the danger of this in two examples,
Joseph had learned in Egypt to swear by the life of Pharaoh, Genesis 42. 15. And
the Prophet complains he was a man of unclean lips, because he dwelt among a
people of unclean lips, Esaias 6. 5. This must therefore cause us to take the
more heed to our souls. Ephesians. 5. 15, 16. Take heed you walk circumspectly,
not as fools; but as wise, redeeming the times, because the days are evil.
Men must do in this case, as they that live in London, when the plague is very
rife, they seek preservatives, and go not abroad without their Pomanders, nor
till they have eaten and drunk some thing, that may preserve them. The worse
the times are, and the less comfort thou have in them, the nearer should
thou draw to God, when the Prophet had spoken in the two former verses of the
extreme badnesse of the times he lived in, see what use he makes of it,
therefore will I look unto the Lord, I will wait upon the God of my salvation;
My God will hear me, Mich. 7. 7. the worse the places are thou live in, the
more diligently should thou give thy self to reading, and hearing, and
prayer. Obadia living in Ahabs house made use of Gods Prophets in private, 1.
King. 18. 4. And Daniel, while he lived in the Court of Darius was given much
to secret prayer, Dan. 6. 10. They that live now in such like places, and give
themselves never the more to praying or reading, declare plainly they have no
care of their souls.

3. The third duty is, that the worse the times are and places we be in, the
more careful we should be to preserve others from the common infection.
Ministers must so much the more vehemently reprove sin, by how much the more
common it grows to be in the place where they live. Titus 1. 12. The Cretians
are always liars, evil beasts, etc. It is Vitium gentis. Therefore verse. 13.
rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the Faith. Parents and Masters
should do in such times, as Joshua did, he resolved thus with himself, but as
for me, and my house we will serve the Lord, Josh. 24. 15. So one Christian
should the rather stir up another, as they that feared God did, Mal. 3. 16.

The third and the last Use of the Doctrine is for comfort and encouragement of
the godly, that are every where hated for nothing so much as for Use 3.
this, that they will not be content to do as their neighbors do, they think
it strange that ye run not with them into the same excess of riot, speaking
evil of you, 1. Pet. 4. 4. and (good souls) they are often ready to faint, and
give over an holy course even for this; as even Elia himself was, 1. King. 19.
10. because they are alone. I will therefore give unto such some encouragements
out of Gods Word, to confirm and comfort them against this temptation:

1. Remember the Commandment of God so often given to his people in his word, to
separate themselves from the world, and be unlike to them. The Lord instructed
me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, Say not ye a
confederacy to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy, Esaias 8.
11, 12. Come out from among them, and be ye separate, says the Lord, and touch
no unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and
ye shall be my sons and daughters says the Lord Almighty, 2. Cor. 6. 17, 18.

2. Remember the necessity that lies upon thee, that thou must do otherwise
than they do, or thou must perish. Better it is to go to heaven alone, and with
the ill will of all thy neighbors than to go to Hell with company, and with
the love of all men. Indeed you should desire their love, and to have peace
with them so far as is possible, and as in you lies, but no further, Romans 12.
18.

3. This is not thy case alone, but has ever been the condition of the godly,
to go thus alone, and to be hated for it, if ye were of the world, the world
would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen
you out of the world, therefore the world hates you, John 15. 19.

4. Consider that thou art not alone; but besides those, that thou may see by
the eye of faith (God, and his Angels, and all the faithful that live already
in glory, who are all of thy side, Heb. 12. 22. 24. In respect of whom, thou
may say, as 2. King. 6. 16. They that be with us, are more than they that be
with them) you shall also find, if you look abroad, and come into such
assemblies as this, that thou have a great number, even in this world, that are
of thy mind. And thou should esteem more of the love of one godly man,
than of the hatred of a thousand such as scorn thee.

5. The fewer that thou have to go with thee, and the more enemies thou find
for this, the surer thou may be, that thy heart is upright, and the more
praise shall thou have with God, Noah was a just man, and perfect in his
generation, Genesis 6. 9. And that was the thing that highly-commended him unto
God. Come thou and all thy house into the Arc, for thee have I seen righteous
before me in this generation, Genesis 7. 1. I know thy works, and where thou
dwell, even where Satan's seat is, and thou hold fast my Name, and have
not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful
Martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells, Reu. 2. 13.

6. Thy living among so many and bad neighbors, shall not hurt thee, if God
have called thee to it, the woman which has a husband that believes not, if
he be pleased to live with her, let her not leave him; for the unbelieving
husband is sanctified by the wife, etc. 1. Cor. 7. 13, 14. but advantage thee
exceedingly. For first, it will make thee so much the more watchful over thy
ways, ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach
of the heathen our 1.
enemies? Neh. 5. 9. Secondly, it will increase thy zeal, Lots zeal and piety
was much increased by living in Sodom, 2. Pet. 2. 7, 8. Thirdly, if thou so
live 2.
amongst them as thou ought, it shall much increase thy glory. God has 3.
promised that the faithful shall be a blessing where they are, Genesis 12. 3.
And what know thou, whether God has placed thee there to that end thou
may win thy neighbor? Who knows (says Mordecay to Ester) whether thou art
come to the kingdom, for such a time as this, Est. 4. 14. what know thou O
wife, whether thou shall save thy husband? and how know thou O man whether
thou shall save thy wife? 1. Cor. 7. 16. Labor so to live, as thou may stop
their mouth, and win them also, as the Apostle exhorts all the faithful that
lived among the Gentiles, and Christian women that had unbelieving husbands to
do, 1. Pet. 2. 12. and 3. 1.

THE NINETY THIRD LECTVRE, ON IVLY XVI. MDCXI.
JOHN IIII. XLIX, L. The Noble man says unto him, Sir, come down ere my
child dye.

Jesus says unto him, Go thy way, thy son lives. And the man believed the
word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.


WE have already heard, that from the beginning of the 46. verse, to the end of
this Chapter, the Evangelist sets down the History of the first miracle Christ
wrought, after his return out of Judea into Galile; and that this History
stands upon four parts: First, the occasion that was offered unto Christ to
do this miracle: Secondly, the manner how Christ wrought this miracle:
thirdly, the fruit and effect of this miracle; Fourthly, the conclusion of the
story. First, the occasion is set down in the 46. and 47. verses. Secondly,
the manner how it was wrought, is declared in the 48. verse, and in these two
that I have now read. And in setting of them down, we have heard the
Evangelist observes three things. First, the check and reproof that Christ
gave unto this great man, and to his whole Nation, verse 48. Secondly, the
answer that this great man made to Christ, when he had been thus rebuked by
him, verse 49. Thirdly, the comfort and satisfaction that Christ gave unto this
Ruler, after he had thus reproved him, and received this answer from him, verse
50.

The first of these three points were finished the last day; it follows now
that we proceed to the two latter: viz. the answer that this great man returned
unto Christ, when he had been thus rebuked by him, and the comfort that in the
end he received from Christ. And first, in the answer of this Ruler, it is to
be observed: 1. That he neither denies, nor confesses the fault Christ
charged him with: 2. He is neither troubled by it, so, as to bewail his
infidelity, and seek pardon and help for it, neither does he excuse or lessen
it any way. 3. Nay (which is strange) he seems not at all to have regarded, or
been moved with this sharp reproof of our Savior, though he so highly
esteemed of him. And what was the cause of it? his grief and care for his
son was so very extreme, that he could mind nothing else, nothing else could
affect him. This had taken up all his thoughts, and all his affections. And
from this example then, we have this Doctrine to learn for our instruction:

That extremity of worldly grief, will make the mind and heart of man
incapable of heavenly things. The proof of this you shall observe in Doct. 1.
two points, which both Scripture and Experience does confirm unto us: First,
it makes the heart unfit to receive benefit by the Word: Secondly, it makes the
heart unfit to pray. For the first, though it be true, that a man is never so
fit to receive good by the Word, never so teachable and tra^table, as when
affliction and sorrow has opened his ear, Job 3^. 16. yea if either
affliction or sorrow be extreme, it so oppresses the heart, it straighteneth
and closes it so, as it makes him unable to profit by the best teacher that
shall come unto him. Tell a man, in such a case, of his sins, tell him of the
rebukes and threats of Gods Word, and you shall not m^ue him; as we find in
this example. So let the best Preacher come to a man in that case, and tell
himof the promises of God, and apply unto him the consolations of the Gospel,
he will be able to find no sweetness in them; yea, he will be unable to
regard them. A notable example we have for this, Exodus 6. 9. Moses and Aaron
came to them with as glad tidings, as could possibly be brought to a people in
their case, (verse 6. 8) yet, though first, the message was so comfortable:
secondly, the persons that brought it were such, as they knew came immediately
from God, Exodus 4. 30, 3^. thirdly, before when they brought them a message,
that was not altogether so full of comfort as this, they received it, and
praised God for it, Exodus 4. 31. yet now it is said, Exodus 6. 9. they hearkened
not unto Moses, they made no reckoning of any thing he had said. And the reason
is given, for angui^h of spirit, and for cruel bondage. And this was not their
case only, but it is the very natural property and effect of extreme
heaviness, to make the soul apt to refuse and reject all comfort. So is it
said of Jacob, when he thought Joseph had been slain, Genesis 37. 35. All his
sons and his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he would not be comforted.
And David complains often, that in this case his soul refused comfort, Psalm
^7 (...). Now for the second point: The man that has had the best gift in
prayer, shall be hardly able to make use of it in this case. Extremity of
sorrow will make a man unfit, and unable to lift up hi heart to God in prayer,
in any comfortable manner. True it is, that first, a man is best able to pray
in affliction and sorrow, if it be moderate, Lord in trouble have they visited
thee; they powered out prayer when thy chastening was upon them, Esaias 26. ^6.
Secondly, no affliction can utterly quench the spirit of prayer in the child
of God, even then when (through extremity of anguish) we know not what to pray
for as we ought, the spirit it self helps our infirmities, and makes
intercession for the Saints according to the will of God. And the Prophet says
that he cry^d unto God and sought him by prayer, even when his spirit was
overwhelmed with sorrow, when he was so troubled that he could not speak,
Psalm. 77. 1 -- 4. that he prayed in that case. But he did it without comfort,
verse 3. I thought upon God, and was troubled; I prayed, and my spirit was f^ll
of angnish. In which respect, the man that is in extreme affliction, is
compared to a drunken man. Esaias 51. 21. Hear now thou miserable and drunken,
but not with wine. And what good can a drunken man receive by the Word? O how
can a drunken man pray?

The Uses of this Doctrine are four: First, to persuade every man to take heed
of immoderate grief, and to fence his heart against excessive Use 1.
sorrow, specially for worldly things. I do not dissuade you from all sorrow:
for I know that all sound Christians are given much to mourning, Blessed are
they that mourn, Matthew. 5. 4. John 16. 20. Verily, verily I say unto you, that
ye shall weep and lament, and the world shall rejoice, and ye shall sorrow.
And this exhortation must not be delivered without caution in this secure age,
wherein men had more need to use all their skill to move men to mourning and
lamentation. And know therefore, that first, it is a sign and note of an
ungracious heart for a man to abandon all sorrow, and repose all his felicity
in carnal joy. Luke 6. 25. Woe be to you that now laugh. Eccles. 7. 6. The
heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in
the house of mirth. Secondly, there be sundry cases, wherein a man is bound to
force his heart to grief and sorrow: as first, for his sins, when the
faithful look upon him whom they have pierced by their sins, they shall
mourn for him as one mourns for his only son, etc. Zach. 12. 10.
secondly, for Gods corrections and tokens of his anger, thou have stricken
them, but they have not grieved, Ier. 5. 3. thirdly, for the dishonor that is
done to God by the sins of others. Psalm. 119. 136. Mine eyes gush out, etc. and
fourthly, for the miseries and afflictions of others. Job 30. 25. Did not I
mourn for him that was in trouble? was not my soul in heaviness for the
poor? Thirdly, know that sorrow is not always hurtful for a man, but many
times exceeding wholesome and profitable. Eccles. 7. 4. It is better to go
into the house of mourning, than into the house of feasting: because this is
the end of all men, and the living shall lay it to his heart. Yea, verse 5.
Anger is better than laughter: for by a sad look the heart is made better.
Though the grief be such which a man conceiueth upon this occasion, that it
even troubles and disquiets the mind (for that is meant by Anger in this
place; and in that also, 1. Chron. 13. 11. David was angry that the Lord had
made a breach in Vzzah.) And though it be so great, that he cannot hide it, but
make show of it in the sadness of his countenance, yet this will do the heart
good. And of godly sorrow, the Apostle says, 2. Cor. 7. 8. Though I made you
sorry with my Letter, yet do I not repent. It were a fond conceit for men to
think, that if they should give place a little to godly sorrow, it would bring
them to despair. No, no, there is no such danger in it, no, it is the readiest
and surest way to attain to true and sound comfort, Be afflicted and mourn
and weep, let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into
heaviness. Humble your selves in the fight of the Lord and he shall lift you
up, Iam. 4. 9, 10. But though this be so, yet is this also the counsel and
exhortation of the Holy Ghost, to moderate our sorrow, and to take heed of
that sorrow that is immoderate and excessive, There is a time to weep, and a
time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance. No man is bound to mourn
continually, to spend all his time in sorrow, Eccles. 3, 4. sufficient unto the
day is the evil thereof, men should not give way to unnecessary sorrows,
Matthew. 6. 34. They that weep should be as though they wept not, they should so
moderate their grief, as it may no way hinder them in any duty to God or man,
1 Cor. 7. 30. yea, even of excessive sorrow for sin, 2. Cor. 2. 7. Ye ought to
comfort him, lest he be swallowed up with over much heaviness. And this
exhortation the Holy Ghost inforceth with sundry reasons:

1. Immoderate sorrow and heaviness of heart is a great curse of God. Deuteronomy.
28. 65. The Lord shall give thee a trembling heart and a sorrowful mind. And
on the other side, a cheerful heart is spoken of as a great blessing, Act.
14. 17. Filling our hearts with food and gladness.

2. It is a great enemy to our health, which God has bound us to have care
of. Pro. 17. 22. A joyful heart causes good health, but a sorrowful mind
dries up the bones. Psalm. 31. 10. My life is wasted with heaviness.

3. It is a maine hinderance to grace in the use of the word and prayer, as we
have heard in the Doctrine. Pro. 15. 13. By the sorrow of the heart the spirit
is broken.

4. It gives great advantage to Satan. It is an old saying, that Melancholia
est vehiculum Daemonum. And experience proves, that we are never so weak, so
apt to receive the temptations of Satan, so unable to resist them, as when we
are oppressed with melancholy and sadness of heart. And this is that that is
said, Neh. 8. 10. The joy of the Lord is our strength. In this respect Paul
charge the Corinthians to comfort the incestuous person, and take heed lest
he were not swallowed up with overmuch heaviness, lest Satan, says he,
circumuent us. For we are not ignorant of his enterprises, 2. Cor. 2. 11.

Lecture the ninety fourth. July 23. 1611. JOHN IIII. XLIX, L.
THe last day we began to speak of the answer, that this Ruler returned unto
Christ, when he had been rebuked of him, and charged with infidelity: which
answer is set down in this verse I have now read unto you. And in it we
observed, that he neither denies, nor acknowledges the fault Christ charged
him and his Nation with. Secondly, he neither shows himself troubled with it,
by confessing his infidelity and seeking pardon, nor does he excuse or lessen
it any way. Thirdly, though he esteemed highly of Christ, and counted him a
Prophet, yet seems he not at all to regard, or be moved one whit with this
sharp reproof he had received from him. Fourthly, no other cause can be
imagined of his senslesnesse and stupidity, but only this, That his grief and
care for his son was so very extreme, that it took up all his thoughts and
affections; it did so oppress him, that he could mind nothing else, nothing
else could affect him. And from hence we received this Doctrine; That extremity
of worldly grief, will make the mind and heart of man incapable of heavenly
things. It makes a man unfit to receive benefit by the Word, and it makes a man
also unapt to pray with comfort. For the Word, though the heart of man be never
so apt to profit by it, never so teachable, as it is in the time of affliction
and heaviness, if it be moderate; yet when it is in extremity, it so
oppresses the heart, that neither the threats of the Law, though they be
pressed upon it by a son of thunder; nor the sweet promises of the Gospel,
though they be applied by such an one as Barnabas, a son of consolation, will
be able to move it, or do it good. And as for prayer, though we are never so
fit for it, as in time of affliction and heaviness, if it be moderate; and
secondly, the spirit of prayer is such a grace, and of that immortal nature,
as no affliction, be it never so extreme, is able utterly to quench it, or to
deprive a man of it, that did ever truly enjoy it: yet if affliction and
sorrow be extreme, it will make the best of Gods children unfit to pray with
that comfort they were wont.

And the reason of this, I showed you, is the great weakness and impotency of
man's nature. Then came we to make our Use of the Doctrine. And the first Use
was to persuade every Christian, to learn the right way how to prevent and
keep his own heart from immoderate sorrow, specially for worldly things.

But because most men are apt to stumble at this exhortation, and this age is
so secure, and so set upon iollity and carnal mirth, that it may seem more
needful for us to use all our skill to humble men, and bring them to remorse
of conscience, than to teach them to strive against sorrow: I did therefore
propound unto my self this order, in handling of this first Use of the
Doctrine. First, to show you how far forth sorrow is fit and necessary for
Christians. Secondly, that yet they must take heed of excessive sorrow.
Thirdly, how, and by what means a man may best preserve and confirm his heart
against it. And of these three points, I finished the two first the last day;
but the time would permit me to go no further. It now remains, that we
proceed to the third and last, and so come to the second Use of the Doctrine.
All men esteem it a miserable thing, to have a heart oppressed with grief,
and seek to shun it by all means. And on the other side, all men esteem it
an happy thing, to have a cheerful and merry heart: but most men are
miserably deceived in the means, whereby the heart may be preserved from
excessive sorrow, and brought unto true joy. But we must know, that true peace
is the peace of God, as the Apostle calls it, Phil. 4. 7. and true joy is the
gift of God. And every Christian should be able to call the Lord, the God of
his joy and gladness, as David does, Psalm. 43. 4. and make no reckoning of
that peace and joy, whereof God is not the author. So that if we would attain
to true peace and joy indeed, we must seek it by such means as God has
directed us to use, and not by any other. Now I find four things especially,
which God has in his Word directed us to use, as remedies and preservatives
against excessive grief, and means to bring us to true joy:

The first is, to get a true justifying faith, and good assurance of our 1.
salvation. This is a sure way to keep the heart from excessive grief, and
make it cheerful: no joy comparable to this, Lord lift up the light of thy
countenance upon us; thou have put gladness in my heart more then in the time
that their corn and their wine increased, Psalm. 4. 6, 7. The joy that grows
from this ground, is unspeakable and glorious, 1. Pet. 1. 8. This is able to
make a man rejoice, when he has never so many means to make him heavy, being
justified by faith we glory in tribulations, Romans 5. 1. 3. this made Paul and
Silas sing so merrily even in the stocks at midnight, Acts 16. 25. For true
faith gives a man many grounds and reasons of sound comfort: First, it assures
him of the pardon of his sin; and when he knows that, no affliction need
trouble him. Matthew. 9. 2. Son, be of good comfort, thy sins are forgiven
thee: for sin is the very sting of death, and of all affliction, 1. Cor. 15.
56. Secondly, he knows he shall never lose the favor of God, after he has
once obtained it, how many signs of Gods anger soever may be upon him. Romans 8.
38, 39. I am persuaded, that neither life, nor death, nor principalities, nor
powers, etc. shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in
Christ our Lord. Thirdly, he knows God will have tender respect to his
weakness, in whatsoever affliction he shall lay upon him, that it shall not
exceed his strength: God will by the strength of his Spirit support and enable
him to bear it, the spirit it self will help his infirmities, Romans 8. 26. 1.
Cor. 10. 13. God is faithful, that will not suffer you to be tempted above
that you be able. Fourthly, he is assured, that whatsoever affliction God
lays upon him, it shall in the end tend to his good, and to the furtherance
of his salvation, Romans 8. 28. Fifthly, he knows the end will pay for all; and
that after a while, all tears shall be wiped from his eyes, and he shall enjoy
unspeakable comfort. Psalm. 27. 13. I should have fainted, except I had
believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Now on the
other side, the man that wants this assurance of his salvation, though he have
all the means in the world to secure and quiet his heart, and to make it
merry, yet can he never attain unto true joy and comfort, nor keep off
extremity of grief, when the evil day shall come upon him.

If any shall object against this, that many of Gods children (that are Object.
assured of their salvation) are yet much oppressed with heaviness, and their
lives are very uncomfortable: and on the other side, that many who want this
assurance, are known to have the lightest and merriest hearts of all other men.

I answer. For the faithful, first, That they have much inward joy, though
they show it not as other men; yea often times when their life seems most Answ.
uncomfortable to the worldly man, and most full of misery. Yea, as Solomon
says of wicked men's joy, Pro. 13. 14. Even in laughter the heart is
sorrowful: so of the heaviness of the godly it may be said often times, that
even in weeping their heart is full of comfort. 2 Cor. 6. 10. As sorrowing, yet
always rejoicing. That as Christ said, Verse. 32. of this Chapter, I have meat
that ye know not of: so have the godly much comfort, which worldlings have no
skill of. Pro. 14. 10. The stranger shall not meddle with his joy.

2 Though they be sometime in great heaviness indeed, yet it is not possible
they should be overcome of it; but they shall certainly recover themselves: as
2 Cor. 4. 8. We are afflicted on every side, yet are we not in distress; in
poverty, yet not overcome of poverty; we are persecuted, but not forsaken;
cast down, but perish not. Because they have ever in them the seed and root of
true joy. Psalm. 97. 11. Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the
upright in heart. So that, as it is not possible for him that is once truly
regenerate, to sin as other men do, because the seed of God, and Spirit of
Sanctification abides in him, 1 Ioh. 3. 9. So it is not possible for him, that
has once attained to true assurance of his salvation, to sorrow as other men
do, or to perish in despair; because the seed of God, the Spirit of Adoption
(which is called the oil of gladness, Psalm. 45. 7.) abides in him. For this
is that that Christ says of this joy, Ioh. 16. 22. Your hearts shall rejoice,
and your joy shall no man take from you. And that makes David say so
confidently, Psalm. 37. 37. Mark the upright man and behold the just: for the
end of that man is peace. And as for that which is objected concerning the joy
of them, that have no assurance of their salvation, I answer: First, that many
times their mirth is but forced and counterfeit; and when outwardly they make
show of much mirth, their hearts within them are as heavy as lead. 2 Cor. 5.
1^. They rejoice in the face, and not in the heart. Pro. 14. 13. Even in
laughing the heart is sorrowful. And secondly, though they seem very secure
and pleasant in the time of prosperity (while like drunken, or mad men, they
have no apprehension, nor sense of their own estate) yet in the evil day, when
their conscience shall be awakened, their joy will fail them, and stand them
in no stead. That which is said of riches, Pro. 11. 4. may be said likewise of
merry company, good cheer, pastimes, and music; They will not avail in the
day of wrath. While they are out of Gods presence, and forget him, and their
own estate, they are quiet and merry; but when Gods glory shines but a little
in their souls, they are troubled out of measure: as we see in the example of
Balthazar, Dan. 5. 6.

O consider this, ye that forget God; esteem not of the joy of worldly men,
give no rest to your selves, till you have gotten good assurance of Application.
your salvation, and of the favor of God in Christ: For without this, nothing
will be able to give you content and comfort in the hour of death, and in the
evil day. Let this be thy desire, and daily prayer to God, that was David's,
Psalm 106. 4, 5. Remember me, O Lord, with the favor of thy people; visit me
with thy salvation, that I may see the felicity of thy chosen, and rejoice with
their joy.

The second preservative against excessive sorrow, is the care of a good
conscience. That man that in all things is careful to please God, and to keep
2.
his conscience pure, that he fall not into any known and grievous sin,
shall ever have a quiet and cheerful heart. 2 Cor. 1. 12. Our rejoicing is
this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly pureness,
we have had our conversation in the world. Yea, this will make a man cheerful
at all times, and preserve him from sorrow; not in prosperity only, but even in
adversity, he that is of a merry heart (he means, whose heart is made merry
this way, even with the testimony of a good conscience) has a continual
feast, Pro. 15. 15. And in this respect, the Apostle, Ephesians. 6. 14. calls
righteousness the Breast Plate, that will defend the heart even in the evil
day. But on the other side, the man that has no care of a good conscience, but
gives himself liberty to live in any one known sin, can never have any
sound joy in his heart; but must needs be overcome of sorrow, and swallowed up
with heaviness, when affliction shall come upon him. For sin certainly will
bring sorrow, sooner or later, not only in the life to come, There shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth, Mat. 8. 12. but even in this life sin will
bring sorrow: it is the proper and natural effect of sin, and cannot be
avoided, Pro. 29. 6. In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare:
that is, matter of sorrow and tears, as appears by the other part of the
Verse: But the righteous does sing and rejoice. They that have multiplied their
sins, shall have their sorrows multiplied; yea, great sins will bring
great sorrows: as we see in the example of Judas, Mat. 27. 3, 5. And many such
examples God gives men in every age. Neither has it been so with such as
Judas only, but even with Gods dear children, when they have neglected the
care of a good conscience, and fallen into gross sins: great sins have
brought them into great sorrows. The sins that have been committed with most
iollity and pleasure, did of all other bring them to the most sorrow of heart
in the end. This Job felt when God caused him to possess the sins of his
youth, he says, Job 13. 26. that he did write bitter things against him. He
found much bitterness in the remembrance of those sins. And David, though he
were of a sanguine constitution, 1 Samuel 16. 12. and consequently, cheerful
naturally; though he were likewise an excellent Musician, and a King also, that
had all outward helps to keep sorrow from his heart; yet when he had given
liberty to himself to commit that sweet sin (as the world calls it) he lost his
chearefulnes, and grew to that inward anguish of spirit, that he cries out in
Psalm. 51. 8. Make me to hear joy and gladness, that the bones which thou have
broken may rejoice. And Ps. 31. 10. My life is wasted with heaviness, and my
years with mourning.

1 O think upon this, you Belly-gods and Wantons, that can find no pleasure but
in offending God. As pleasant as you be now, you will have the heauiest
Application.
hearts one day of any people under the Sun, Woe be to you that laugh now, for
ye shall mourn and weep, Luke 6. 25. 2 And you, Beloved, Would you have a
cheerful heart, and be comfortable even in affliction, in the time of your
sickness, and at the hour of your death? have care then of a good conscience,
take heed of known sins. Do you feel your hearts at any time begin to be
oppressed with heaviness? Examine your lives, find out your chief sins,
purge your selves from them by repentance, and so shall ye keep your selves
from being overcome with grief.

The third preservative and means to keep a man's heart from excessive grief,
(specially for any worldly occasion) is to make the Lord his treasure, 3.
and not any earthly thing. If a man do not ouer-value these earthly comforts
(husbands, wives, friends, children, health, wealth, liberty, peace, etc.) nor
count them his chief treasure, but esteem them, as they are indeed,
transitory comforts; and count the Lord his favor and grace, his chief
treasure: If a man set not his heart on these things, but love them only in the
Lord, then shall he not be oppressed with immoderate sorrow for them, when God
shall take them away. What a notable help it is against excessive sorrow, when
a man can keep his heart from the overmuch love of these things, we shall
find, 1 Cor. 7. ^0 where (when the Apostle had said, Let them that weep be as
though they wept not) he adds presently, And they that rejoice, as though they
rejoiced not: as if he should say, Would thou keep thy self from weeping and
mourning too much for these things, when thou shall lose them? then rejoice not
too much in them, when thou do possess them. And for the other point, what
force there is in this, to stay the heart from immoderate grief for worldly
things, when a man can make the Lord (his favor and grace) his chief
treasure, you shall find, Esa. 33. 6. There shall be stability of thy times,
strength salvation wisdom, and knowledge: for the fear of the Lord shall be
his treasure: As if he should say, In all times, the man that has made the
fear of the Lord his treasure, shall have stability, and strength, and
salvation, wisdom, and knowledge. And our Savior, when he dehorts his
Disciples from that care for earthly things, as will bring grief and vexation
to the heart, prescribes this for a remedy against it, Mat. 6. 33. But seek ye
first the Kingdom of God, and the righteousness thereof, etc. On the other
side, the man that makes these worldly things his chief treasure, and sets his
heart upon them, cannot choose but be oppressed with sorrow, when he shall be
deprived of them: as we see in the example of Ahab, 1 King. 21. 5, 6. When he
could not get Naboths Vineyard, his spirit was exceeding sad, and he could not
eat his meat. And why so? His pleasure was his treasure; he loved Naboths
vineyard too well, and it was a death to him to be kept from it.

Then may I say to every one of you, that have no felicity but in earthly
Application.
things; in your wealth, your belly-cheere, your merry company, your pastimes
and sports, your brave apparel, your credit and favor with men, you love them
more than God, you affect them, and care for them more than for God: as our
Savior in another case said, Luke 21. 6. Are these the things that ye look
upon? Have you no better comforts than these? Alas, how woeful will your case
be, when you must part with these things? Consider what is said, Job 27. 8.
What hope has the hypocrite, when he has heaped up riches, if God take away
his soul? Can he hope that God will hear his cry, when trouble comes upon
him? Will he set his delight on the Almighty, and call upon God at all times?
Follow therefore the counsel of our blessed Savior, Mat. 6. 19. Lay not up
treasures for your selves upon earth; but lay up treasure for your selves in
heaven. And mark well the reason of our Savior, which he gives, Verse 21. For
where your treasure is, there will your hearts be also: q. d. If you make
earthly things your treasure, you will immoderately joy in them, when you have
them; and grieve for them, when you shall want them.

Consider first, that these things are not our proper goods; but cast more 1.
plentifully on reprobates, than on Gods children, If ye have not been
faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your
own? Luke 16. 12. But Gods favor and grace is our peculiar portion.

These things are not durable, neither can we have any certainty in them,
Trust not in uncertain riches, 1 Timothy 6. 17. But Gods favor and 2.
grace is everlasting, The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever,
Psalm. 19. 9.

These things are vain, and can yield us no help, no comfort, when we shall
most stand in need, Riches profit not in the day of wrath, Proverb. 11. 3.
4. Whereas the sense of Gods favor and grace will yield us comfort, even in
the greatest affliction, it will make us even to glory in the greatest
tribulation, Romans 5. 3.

The fourth and last preservative against immoderate sorrow, is, for a man to
be rightly persuaded of his liberty in the use of the outward comforts 4.
of this life, as a good diet and good company, and following our worldly
callings, and recreations, and such like. Let no man say this preservative
might well be spared, as beseeming the Physician, much better than the Divine;
for first, many a good soul have great need of this preservative, and give
great advantage to Satan in the anguish of their conscience, by persuading
themselves they should much offend God, if they should give liberty to
themselves to enjoy the creatures of God for their delight; if they should
keep company, or follow their callings, or be merry at any time, or use
recreations. Secondly, in speaking of this Point I will keep my self in mine
own element, and speak that which I have received, not from the Physician,
but from the Lord. Yet have I reserved this preservative for the last place;
because that which you have heard in the three former, will much help you to
receive this with profit, and not with hurt. For, first, that which I have to
say in this point, belongs only to such as know themselves to be reconciled to
God in Christ Jesus; the rest must go to the Physician for comfort in this
case: I have none for them. To such I say, as delight is not seemly for a
fool, it is an unseemly and absurd thing in the eye of every wise man, to see
an ungracious man so merry and iocund. Pro. 19. 10. God has created all the
comforts of this life to be received with thanksgiving of them that believe and
know the truth, and of none else, 1 Timothy 4. 3. Secondly, If a man use things
without sobriety, and affect them too much, as if he had no better comforts
than these, he shall never receive good by them. It is made the note of a man
that shall never go to Heaven, Psalm. 24. 4. To lift up his mind unto vanity.
It is easy for a man to surfeit, and take too much of these things, Prou. 25.
16. If you have found honey (says Solomon) eat that that is sufficient for
thee, lest thou be over full, and vomit it. Of the comfort and refreshing that
many take in these things, it may be said, as Prou. 14. 13. The end of that
mirth is heaviness: yet certainly, there is great force in these things, being
rightly used, to keep the heart from being overcome with sadness, and to make
it cheerful. This appears plainly by the contrary, even by the restraint
God has enjoined unto his servants, in the use of these things, at such times
as he calls them to mourning. On the day of the Fast, because it was to be a day
of humiliation, Leuit. 23. 27. and 29. 32. men might not enjoy the liberal use
of Gods creatures. In those days I Daniel was mourning three whole weeks: I
ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I
anoint my self at all till three whole weeks were fulfilled, Dan. 10. 2, 3.
Nor follow the works of their lawful callings, Whatsoever soul it be that
does any work in that same day, that same soul will I destroy from among his
people, Leuit. 23. 30. Nor allow to themselves the comfort of society, Let the
bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her bedchamber,
Joel 2. 16. In it men separated themselves from their wives, Zach. 7. 3. The
husbands kept it (in a secret fast) apart, and their wives apart, Zach. 12. 12.
Nor use recreation, nor the means of mirth; Gods people in the time of their
mourning for Jerusalem when they were in captivity, did forbear their singing,
and all other means of mirth, preferring Jerusalem before their chief joy,
Psalm 137. 4, 6. And indeed, it is very evident, that these are good means
appointed of God, to refresh and comfort the heart of man.

First, for a liberal diet, we know what is said, Pro. 31. 6, 7. Give ye
strong drink to him that is ready to perish. And 1 Timothy 4. 4. Every creature of
God is good, and nothing ought to be refused (specially, not upon conscience,
and conceit of unlawfulness) if it be received with thanksgiving.

Secondly, for society; what a comfort it is we may find by this, that Satan's
best advantage to tempt Christ, was, when he was all alone in the wilderness,
and utterly barred from all society of men, Matthew. 4. 1.

Thirdly, for following our callings, the many promises of comfort and joy that
are made unto them that walk diligently in their callings, prove it plainly,
When thou eatest the labors of thy hands, thou shall be blessed, and it shall be
well with thee, Psalm. 128. (...). Ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand
unto, Deuteronomy. 2. 7. The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, Eccl. 5. 12.

And for them all, that a Christian, upon no pretense of humiliation for sin,
or for too long a time, may altogether deprive himself of these outward
comforts, may have a notable example of David, even then when he had as great
cause to be humbled, as any poor sinner can have, 2 Samuel 12. 20. 4. 29. 31.
When the child was dead (though the remembrance and sense of his sin died not
with the child) he arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself;
yea he used again the lawful comfort of the marriage bed, he exercised
himself again in the works of his calling, and fought the Lords battles, and
showed great severity against the enemies of the Lord.

Lecture the ninety fifth. July 10. 1611. JOHN IIII. XLIX, L.
WE have already observed in the speech of this Ruler which is set down, Ver.
49 that his heart was so oppressed with care, and fear, and grief for his
son, as he could not mind what Christ said unto him; he could not be troubled
or moved at all with the sharp reproof he received from him; though he
esteemed highly of him, yet does he not regard what he said unto him. And from
hence we have received this Doctrine, That worldly grief and affliction, if it
be extreme and violent, is wont to make the mind and heart incapable of
heavenly things; unable to receive any benefit by the Word, and unfit also to
pray with comfort. And the first Use I told you was to be made of this
Doctrine, is, to persuade every Christian to learn the right way, how to
prevent and keep his own heart from immoderate sorrow, specially from worldly
things. And thus far we proceeded the last day. It remains now, that we
come to another Use, that is to be made of this Doctrine, and so we will
proceed unto that that follows. The second and last Use of the former
Doctrine, is, to dissuade all men from putting off the care of their souls,
and providing for the welfare and salvation of them until the evil day. It is
wisdom for a man to seek reconciliation with God, and assurance of it,
presently and without delay, while he is in his best health. And to make his
best benefit of all good means of grace, and to get good grounds of assurance
of his salvation, before affliction come; while his mind and memory is free,
and his heart cheerful. This we know is the exhortation of Solomon, Eccl. 12.
1. Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil daeies
come not, nor the years of affliction, wherein you shall say, I have no
pleasure in them: q. d. Thou should think of thy Creator, and make thy peace
with him, serve and fear him now presently, even in the days of thy youth:
for the evil day will certainly come upon every man (he speaks properly there
of age and sickness, but the same may be said likewise of all times of bitter
affliction) for at that time thou shall have no lust or pleasure, to think or
do any thing. And this is that also which the Apostle means, Ephesians. 6. 13.
Take unto you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to resist in the
evil day. When should they thus provide themselves of armor? Why, now before
the evil day comes. What means he by the evil day? Certainly, the day of
affliction and temptation, which every man must look for. What man will have
his armor to seek, when he is to go into the field, and buckle with his enemy?
This is the wisdom we are taught to learn of the silly Pismire, Pro. 6. 7.
She prepares her meat in the summer, and gathers her food in harvest. And
indeed, there is not one of a thousand, but he is thus wise for his body. He
makes provision for his corn, and fodder, and fuel, now in summer and
harnest, and lays it up against winter. Who is so mad, as to have his
provision to make in winter, or his seed to sow in harvest, when he should
reap? And thus wise should we be for our souls. Prou. 10. 14. Wise men lay up
knowledge beforehand: he treasures up such grounds of comfort through the
knowledge of the Word, as he may not be to seek in time of need. What man will
have his cuidence to seek, when his cause is to be tried? And what man is
there that has not need of this exhortation? What man is there that plays the
good husband for his soul? that labors and takes pains to provide for it in
the summer time, when the weather is fair: I mean, in the days of his youth,
and health, and peace, and cheerfulness? that does not fully purpose and
resolve with himself, to go about his business far more seriously and
carefully, when he shall be old, or when he shall be sick on his last
sickness, than ever he did yet? Nay, it is certain, there is many a man, that
would not for all the world die in that state that now he is in, having no
better assurance of his salvation, than yet he has, having no better repented
than yet he has done; and yet he never takes any course to better his estate,
because he is persuaded in his heart, he may do that soon enough hereafter;
and that the fittest time of all for this business, will be the time of
sickness and affliction. And (quite contrary to Salomons counsel) he says
this to his own heart, I will not remember my Creator in the days of my
youth, before the evil day come, and the years approach, wherein I shall say,
I have no pleasure in them. But then, lo, will I prepare my self for God, and
make my peace with him; then will I send for the Preacher, and he shall give me
good counsel out of Gods Word, and pray for me; then will I repent me of all
my sins, and take order by my Will, for restitution of all that I have
unjustly gotten; then will I become a new man. I will therefore give you some
reasons out of Gods Word, that may enforce this exhortation upon the conscience
of every man.

The first reason is the uncertainty of this life. There is no man but he may
die suddenly. And it is certain, that no man can be assured when he lays him
down at night, that he shall rise in the morning; when he rises in the
morning, that he shall ever go to bed again. Therefore remember thy Creator
now: presently, without delay, repent and seek assurance of his favor, put it
not off, no not for a day; for no man knows what may befall him before to
morrow. James 4. 13, 14. Go to now (says the Apostle) ye that say, to day or
to morrow we will go into such a City, and continue there a year, and buy,
and sell, and get gain, and yet ye cannot tell what shall be to morrow. For,
what is your life? it is even a vapor. Confider with thy self that thou may
die suddenly. For, first, what year is there wherein thou have not heard of
sundry good men, and bad, of all sorts, whom God has taken away suddenly, and
not given them one days, nor one hours respit to prepare themselves for him?
And what assurance have thou that he will deal better with thee? This Solomon
speaks as of a thing that has fallen out in all ages, and whereunto all sorts
of men (as well good as bad) have been subject. Eccl. 9. 12. For neither does
man know his time; but as the fishes which are taken in an evil net, and as
the birds that are caught in a snare; so are the children of men snared in the
evil time when it falls upon them suddenly. But as every man (even the best)
may die suddenly; so the carnal and wicked man (that presumptuously puts off
his repentance, upon this hope, that God will not take him away so suddenly,
but he will give him space and time of visitation before his death, as he does
to most men) has just cause to fear, he shall die suddenly. For God has often
smitten many such men in the act of their sin, he did so to Zimri and Cozby,
Number. 25. 8. and with Elah the king of Israel, 1 King. 16. 9, 10. and with king
Herod also, Acts 12. 23. and has often threatened this unto ungodly men, Psalm. 64
7. God will shoot an arrow at them suddenly, their strokes shall be at once.
and 73. 19. How suddenly are they destroyed, perished and utterly consumed. 1
These. 5. 3. When they shall say, Peace and safety, then shall come upon them
sudden destruction. If any shall object, that if this were so, then most men
should die suddenly, whereas experience shows, that not one of an hundred does
so. I answer, that as no godly man may be said to die suddenly (that fears
always, and is at peace with God, and ever prepared for death) so there is not
one wicked man of an hundred, but he dies suddenly: for though the Lord gives
him a great space, and he be never so long sick before his death; yet he is
still ready to think he shall live a little longer: and so death comes upon him
before he looked or prepared for it. This is that the Apostle teaches, 1 These.
5. 4. But ye brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should come upon you
as it were a thief. q. d. To no true belieuer it comes as a thief, but to
every one that is in darkness, it does.

The second Reason that may justly make a man afraid to put off the care of
providing for the salvation of his soul, till the evil day, is, That no man 2.
can tell how long he shall enjoy the means of grace, no man can meet the
Bridegroom, unless he have oil in his lamp; and that he cannot have but of
them that sell it, Mat. 25. 9. No affliction or sickness is able to save a
soul without the Word, that made the Prophet say, Blessed is the man whom thou
chastenest O Lord, and teach him out of thy Law, Psalm. 94. 12. Nay every
Preacher will not serve the turn, but he had need to be a rare man that should
do good in such a case, Job 33. 23. If there be then a messenger, an
interpreter, one of a thousand, he had need have the tongue of the learned,
that should know to minister a word in time to him that is weary, Esa 50. 4.
And who can assure himself to have such a man to be with him in his last
sickness? They only that have esteemed the Word in their health, may assure
themselves to have it for their comforter in sickness. But the wicked man,
that has despised the ministry of the Word, in the days of his health and
prosperity, has just cause to fear, God will deprive him of the comfort of it
in his sickness and affliction. For so God has threatened such contemners of
his Word, Amos 8. 12. They shall wander from sea to sea, and fr^ the North even
to the East shall they run to and fro to seek the Word of the Lord, and shall
not find it: and Ezekiel. 7. 25, 26 When destruction comes, they shall seek
peace and shall not have it. Calamity shall come upon calamity, then shall
they seek a vision of the Prophet; but the law shall perish from the Priest,
and counsel from the ancient: q. d. O then let every man make his benefit of
the means of grace, now while he does enjoy them; while Gods merchant men are
among you make you provision of oil for your lamps. No man can be sure to have
the like means, when he would himself. 2 Cor. 6. 2 Behold now the accepted
time, behold now the day of salvation.

The third reason to persuade men to reconcile themselves to God, and to get
assurance of their salvation, presently in their youth, and in their best
health 3.
is this, that though a man were sure he should have as good means for his
instruction, and conversion, and comfort, in his last sickness as he has now;
yet he shall find himself most unfit at that time, to make his benefit of
them. Sickness and extreme affliction will so dull the mind, and make the
heart so heavy: yea, a man shall then have so many means to trouble and
distract him, as he shall not be able to relish any sweetness in the best
counsel that is given him, in the holiest prayers that are made by him. These
are the days which Solomon speaks of, Eccl, 12. 1. Wherein a man shall say, I
have no pleasure in them. Remember what case the best of Gods servants have
been in, in their extreme affliction. They have been unable to pray; they have
been astonished and could not speak, Psalm. 77. 4. yet thou say, thou will then
pray. They have been unable to relish or profit by the best means, They
harkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, Exodus 6. 9. Yea, their souls
have refused comfort, Psalm. 77. 2. and thou say, then thou will send for the
Preacher, and take his counsel. They have been oppressed with the burden of
their sins; David says of himself at such a time that his iniquities had
taken such hold upon him, as he was not able to look up, that they were more
in number then the hairs of his head, and that therefore his heart failed him,
Psalm. 40. 12. and thou say, then thou will cast off all thy sins, and get
assurance of the pardon of them. They have been feign to spend upon the old
stock, and to comfort themselves (not with that which they have found in
themselves for the present, but) by calling to mind the good things they knew
were in them in former times, Job seeks to recover his comfort this way, as is
plain, Chap. 29. and 30. and 31. and so did David likewise when his spirit was
overwhelmed within him, his heart within him was desolate, then he remembered
the days of old, Psalm. 143. 4, 5. They have sown before unto themselves in
righteousness, as the Prophet speaks, Hos. 10. 12. And all thy hope is in
the comfort you shall find then: Thou deferrest to sow till that time when thou
should reap. O foolish man, deceive not thine own heart any longer; do not
imagine thou shall be in better case, when sickness and extreme affliction
shall come, than the best of Gods children have been.

Whilst thou art now in health, get assurance of thy salvation; for thou will
be then unfit to do it. Seek and lay up knowledge now; for that will be a time
of spending thy stock that thou have gotten, not of increasing it. Give thy
self much to prayer now, and get assurance that thou have the spirit of
prayer; for then thou will be hardly able to do it.

The fourth Reason to dissuade a man from putting off his repentance till
sickness, is this, That though he were sure to have never so good means of 4.
repentance, and though sickness and grief it self had no force to hinder
him from profiting by them; yet shall he be unable to receive good by them,
unless the Lord be pleased to work with them, O Lord, I know that the way of
man is not in himself; It is not in man that walks to direct his steps, Ier.
10. 23. And every man that has wilfully deferred and put off the time of his
repentance, has just cause to fear, that God will not then work with the
means to do him good. For first, as God has in his counsel set and
determined the day of every man's visitation, the just time and moment of every
man's conversion, which, if he pass, he shall never be converted: So is every
man to account, not the time to come, but the present time, when God by his
Word and Spirit moves him to repent, to be his day, the time of grace and
repentance to him. Therefore Heb. 3. and 4. this is four times repeated, To
day if you will hear his voice. Secondly, the nature of sin, is, to harden
the heart, and the longer that any sin is continued in, the harder it will
make the heart, and the more unable to repent. No man that once gives liberty
to himself in any sin, is able to say, Thus far will I go, and then I will
stay my self; thus long will I continue in it, and then I will repent. The
longer a man continues in this net and snare, the more he shall be entangled in
it, and with the more difficulty get out: the deceitfulness of sin will
harden the heart, Heb. 3. 13. Thirdly, the Lord has threatened to punish the
presumptuous sinner with hardness of heart. Ezekiel. 24. 13. Because I would have
purged thee from thy filthiness, and thou wast not purged, thou shall not be
purged from thy filthiness, till I have caused my wrath to light upon thee.

The fifth and last Reason, to dissuade from this putting off our repentance,
is this, That though a man were sure, God would both give him as 5.
good means of grace, as ever he had in his age or last sickness; and also
work effectually with them to his unfeigned conversion, yet can he not
(ordinarily) have that comfort in it, as he might have had, if he had been
converted sooner.

First, in respect of the cause and fountain, from whence this change of his
does spring: For he shall have cause to doubt and fear, that his repentance
proceeds rather from a servile fear of Gods judgments, than a sincere love of
God himself Many (we know) have seemed in affliction very penitent, whose
hearts have proved very unsound, When he slew them, then they sought him: and
they returned, and enquired early after God: nevertheless, they did flatter
him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongue; for their heart
was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant, Psalm. 78.
34, 37.

Secondly, in respect of the fruits of repentance; which are a singular
testimony and evidence of the sincerity thereof; and consequently, a
principal means of comfort, Bring forth fruits meet for repentance, says John
Baptist to his hearers, Mat. 3. 8. This was Paul's great comfort, Our rejoicing
is this, even the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly
sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God we have had our
conversation in the world, 2 Cor. 1. 12. And this he says will be a great
comfort to every man, when he can approve the truth of his repentance by his
works and conversation: Let every man prove his own work, and then shall he
have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another, Gal. 6. 4. A great part
of this comfort they are deprived of, that die so soon as they have begun to
repent.

Thirdly, in respect of the Lords acceptance: for he shall have cause to doubt
and fear, lest when he has bestowed on Sin and Satan all the best of his time,
the Lord should refuse to accept of the dregs, and refuse of it, according to
that, If ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the
lame and sick, is it not evil? ye brought that which was torn, and the lame,
and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand,
says the Lord, Mal. 1. 8, 13.

Lecture the ninety sixth. August 11. 1611. JOHN IIII. L.
WE have already heard, that in this Verse is set down the comfort and
satisfaction it pleased Christ to give to this Nobleman, after he had rebuked
him, in these words, Jesus said unto him, go thy way, thy son lives. And
herein the goodness of Christ is to be observed in two points: First, that he
showed his divine power in the cure even of a bodily infirmity: Secondly, that
he did it at the request of a man, that was so weak in Faith, as this Ruler
was. This is (I say) first to be observed, that our Savior here showed his
Divine power in the cure of a bodily disease. And because this is the first
time, that mention is made of a miracle of this kind, in the harmony of the
Gospel, and it is afterward often spoken of; we will here (once for all)
consider and handle this point, as the Doctrine which this Text gives us direct
occasion to observe, That our Savior (in the days of his flesh) showed his
divine power no way so much, as in curing the bodies of Doct. 1.
men. This is a point worthy to be observed, That whereas our Savior was sent
into the world, not to do the office of a Chyrurgion or Physician to the
bodies of men, but to give life and salvation to their souls, God sent his
only begotten Son, to the end, that whosoever belieues in him, might not
perish, but have life everlasting, John 3. 16. and had the name of Jesus, a
Savior, given unto him, in no other respect, but because he should save his
people from their sins, Mat. 1. 21. and therefore also, when he gives
himself the title of a Physician, he expounds himself, and says, he was a
Physician, not for the body, but for the soul; the physic he had to give,
served to cure the soul of sin, by calling men to repentance, Mat. 9. 12,
13. Yet for all that, if we look into the story of his life, we shall find,
that for one man, whose soul he cured, by bringing him unto repentance; there
were many, whose bodies he helped, and restored unto health; yea, that the most
of all the miracles, that he wrought upon earth, were done in the curing of the
bodies of men. Indeed, after his resurrection and ascension, he declared his
power wonderfully in curing and converting the souls of men, as Peter
speaks, Acts 3. 26. God has raised up his Son Jesus, and h^ ^e has sent
to bless you, in turning every one of you from your iniquities. A^ (...). 31.
Him has God lift up with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Savior, to give
repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. But in the days of his flesh
he did perform the part of a Physician, for the body rather than for the
soul: for he did most diligently and carefully exercise him^e, in d^ng cures
upon the bodies of men. This you shall the better understand, if you will mark
six points, which I have observed in these cures that ou^ Savior wrought,
which I will run over as fast as I can.

First, the persons whom he cured; he refused none, that came unto him for
help: he excepted against none. Mat. 12. 15. Great multitudes followed him,
and he healed them all. Yea, Luke 4. 40. He laid his hands on every one of
them, and healed them.

Secondly, the diseases themselves that he cured, Agues, Mat. 8. 15. palsies,
Mat. 9. 2. dropsies, Luke 14. 2. leprosies, Luke 5. 12. issues of blood, Mat.
9. 20. blindness, John 9. 1. deafness, Mar. 7. 32. dumbness, Matthew. 15. 30.
lamenesse, Mat. 21. 14. lunacy, Mat. 4. 24. In a word, there was no kind of
disease whatsoever, that he refused or failed to help men of, that came unto
him for help. Mat. 4. 23. He healed every sickness, and every disease among
the people.

Thirdly, observe the time he took for curing of men: he neglected no
opportunity to do it: he cured very many on the Sabbath days, Luke 13. 14.
yea, after he had spent himself by preaching in the Synagogue at Capernaum
upon a Sabbath day, yet when Even was come, and the Sun was down, they brought
to him all that were diseased thereabout, and he healed them, Mar. 1. 32. Yea,
the Evangelist Luke, speaking of that very miracle, Luke 4. 40. says, He laid
his hands on every one of them, and healed them.

Fourthly, observe the place wherein he did these cures, he did them often times
in the Synagogues and Church. assemblies, Matthew. 21. 14. Mark 3. 3. Luke 13.
10. 12.

Fifthly, his readiness and willingness to help men in this case. He did not
this only when he was sought unto, but of his own accord many times. If he
did but see any that was diseased, he was ready to offer his help unto them,
though they never desired it. This you shall find observed especially, in all
those that he cured on the Sabbath days: whether it were for fear of their
Teachers and Rulers, or out of a superstitious conceit that themselves had
entertained of the Sabbath, there was not any one of them all, that sought his
help this way upon the Sabbath day, but he sought unto them rather, and offered
his help unto them, Luke 6. 6. 8. and 13. 12. and 14. 2. 4. Ioh. 5. 6. and 9.
1. 16. 14.

Sixthly and lastly observe, with what affection and compassion of heart he did
these cures; even as one that had in himself a feeling of all those pains and
miseries that they did endure. Matthew. 20. 34. Moved with compassion (toward
the two blind men) he touched their eyes. And Mark 1. 41. Jesus had
compassion, and put forth his hand, and touched the Leper. And Mark 7. 34. He
sighed, and said unto him, Ephphata.

Let us now come to the Reasons, that moved our blessed Savior thus far Reason.
forth to debase himself, as to cure the diseases of the bodies of men in this
sort. And I find three principal Reasons of it:

First, he did this to prove himself to be the Son of God. For the curing 1.
of such diseases, in such a manner as he did, was sufficient to convince the
conscience of every man, that he was indeed the Son of God. John 15. 24. If I
had not done works among them, which none other man did, they had not had
sin. So does he reason with the Scribes, Matthew. 9. 6. That ye may know that
the son of man has authority upon earth, to forgive sins (then said he to
the sick of the palsy) Arise, take up thy bed, and go to thine house. If any
shall object against this argument, that the Prophets and Apostles did also
miraculous cures upon all manner of diseases; I answer, It is true, they did
so; yea, the Apostles did greater miracles than those that our Savior did;
according to that promise, John 14. 12. He that believes in me, the works
that I do, he shall do also, yea greater than these shall he do: for I go
unto my father. And Act. 19. 11, 12. God wrought no small miracles by the hands
of Paul; so that from his body were brought unto the sick kerchiefes and
hand-kerchiefes, and the diseases departed from them. Yea, it may appear, Acts
5. 15. That the very shadow of Peter di^ure many.

But yet I say that though the Prophets and Apostles did the same, yea greater
miracles than our Savior did, yet did not they them in the same manner that he
did: he did them in that manner as never any other did, and as did evidently
prove him to be the Son of God. Two notable differences therefore you shall
observe between the miracles of the Prophets and Apostles, and the miracles of
Christ. First, he wrought his miracles in his own name, and by his own power
and commandment; and so did none of them. They were wont to use earnest
prayer, when they were to do a miracle, that they might declare the power
whereby they were to work, was none of their own, but to be received from
above, so did Eliah in restoring of the widow of Sareptaes child to life, 1.
King. 17. 20. 21. and Peter in restoring of Tabitha, Acts 9. 40. so did the
Elders in the miraculous curing of the sick, by anointing them with oil,
Iam. 5. 14, 15. Or if any time they did not use prayer, but did their miracles
rather by way of commanding, than of invocation; yet they ever professed they
did them not in their own name, or by their own power, but only in the name
of Jesus. Acts 16. 18. I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ, that thou
come out of her. Secondly, he had this power at all times, and could do these
miracles whenever he would: so could none of them. The Apostles (though they
had received the gift to cast out Devils, Matthew. 10. 8.) yet could they not do
it at all times, Matthew. 17. 16. And Paul (though he had that marvelous power
to heal all diseases, even with the hand-kerchiefes that were carried from his
body, Act. 19. 12.) yet had he not this gift at all times; for then would not
he have suffered Epaphroditus to have been so near unto death as he was,
Phil. 2. 27.

The second Reason why Christ wrought so many miracles for the curing of men's
bodily infirmities, was to prove himself to be that Messia 2.
and Savior that God had promised by the Prophets. When the Prophet had
foretold the coming of the Messia, Esaias 35. 4. Behold your God comes, even
God with a recompense, he will come and save you: He tells them in the next
words, verse 5. 6. what manner of miracles he should do when he came, whereby
they should know him: Then shall the eyes of the blind be lightened, and the
ears of the dease be opened; then shall the lame man leap as an Heart, and the
dumb man's tongue shall sing. And our Savior (when John Baptist sent two of
his Disciples unto him, to know whether he were the Messiah that should come,
or whether they should look for another) he proves himself to be so, by the
manner and kind of miracles which he wrought. Matthew. 11. 4, 5. Go and show
John what things ye have heard and seen, the blind receive sight, the halt
do go, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf do hear, the dead are raised up.
And we shall find this notable difference between the miracles of Christ, and
those of all the Prophets and Apostles; that whereas some of their miracles
tended to the hurt and punishment of man (as Moses miracles in Egypt, and Elias
in calling fire from heaven, to destroy two wicked Captains, and an hundred
soldiers, 2. Kings 1. 10. and Peter's in the destruction of Ananias and
Saphira, Acts 5. 9. and Paul's in striking Elymas with blindness, Acts 13. 11.)
Christ never showed his divine power in executing vengeance upon any man; but
all his miracles tended only to the profit and benefit of man. They were all
suitable to that office he had received from his father, and fit to declare him
to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world; they were all agreeable to the
Doctrine that he was to teach; namely, the glad tidings of the Gospel. Indeed,
he showed in two mighty works of his, in causing the figtree to wither, and
the soldiers that came to apprehend him to fall backward upon the ground,
Matthew. 21. 19. John 18. 6. what he could have done this way; but he never did
by his miraculous power hurt any man. The time he lived in was as corrupt as
ever any age was, and he had many mortal enemies; and his own Disciples (even
those he loved best, James and John) provoked him earnestly to it, after the
example of Eliah: yet could he never be brought to do the least hurt to any
man. But rebuking these Disciples sharply for their motion, he gives this for
his reason, Luke 9. 56. The Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but
to save them: as if he should have said, I must do only such works, as may
show and declare me to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world.

The third and last Reason, why our Savior did so busy himself in 3.
curing the diseases of men's bodies, was that he might thereby the better draw
men to seek unto him for the health and salvation of their souls. That as at
that time when Christ lived upon the earth, the people of God were vexed with
more and more strange diseases, than they were in any age before, that ever we
can read of: there were more Lepers, and Lunatickes, and men possessed with
Devils, than in any age before; that God might by this means humble men, and
bring them to the sense of sin, and of the wrath of God, and so cause them to
feel the need they had of a Savior, and to long after the coming of the
Messiah: so by this marvelous power and willingness that they saw in him, to
deliver them from all their bodily diseases and miseries, he sought to teach
them, that he was indeed the Savior they were to look for; and to draw them
to seek unto him for full deliverance from all their sins, and from the
wrath of God, which they had deserved by them. That was indeed the chief end
he propounded to himself in all his miracles; as we shall see plainly
expressed in sundry places. When they brought one to him to be cured of the
Palsy, Matthew. 9. 2. he said unto him, Son, be of good comfort, thy sins
are forgiven thee. So Matthew. 8. when the Evangelist had said, verse 16. He
healed all that were sick: he adds, verse 17. That it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet, He took our infirmities and bare our
sicknesses. As if he should say, This was done to signify unto men, and to
teach them, that this was he, by whom should be fulfilled that which was spoken
by the Prophet, touching the satisfaction that was to be made unto God for all
our sins. So the end he aimed at, in feeding the bodies of men miraculously,
was to draw them, to seek from him, a better food, even the food of the soul;
as himself tells them, John 6. 26, 27. So when he was to cure the blind man,
John 9. to show his intent in doing that cure, he says, verse 5. So long as I
am in the world, I am the light of the world, and verse 6. so soon as he had
thus spoken, he cured the man: as if he should have said in plain terms, My
meaning in doing this cure, is to teach men, that I am the light of the world.
So we read, Matthew. 11. 20. that he vpbraided the Cities, in which most of his
mighty works were done, because they repented not: whereby it appears, that
the thing he aimed at in doing those mighty works, was to bring them unto
repentance. So that by the mercy and goodness he showed upon their bodies,
(which they were most sensible of) he sought to draw them both to the knowledge
and desire of the salvation of their souls.

This Doctrine teaches us what to judge of all Popish miracles, of which they
boast so much, and wherein they think, they have so great an advantage Use. 1.
against us. Surely, by this we may know they are no true miracles; either they
are mere tricks of legerdemaine, or (at the best) they are such lying
wonders, as the Apostle speaks of, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 9. done by the working of
Satan, and not by the power of God; because they are altogether unlike the
miracles of Christ, they tend no way to the benefit or profit of men. For (to
pass by the apish tricks that they observe and admire in sundry of their
chief Images, the nodding of their heads, and rolling of their eyes, their
weeping, and sweating, and bleeding) let us consider the chief of all their
miracles in their sacrament of the Altar (wherein they say, that by the
omnipotent power of Christ, the substance of the bread and wine after the words
of consecration, is turned into the substance of his body and blood) let us I
say examine this grand miracle by the Doctrine we have now heard; and we shall
find, that this is no miracle of Christ; there is no such thing done in the
Sacrament, by the omnipotent power of Christ, because it tends no way to the
benefit or profit of men; for, first, there is no certainety in it, no Papist
(I say) can be certain, that the Sacrament he receives, is the very body and
blood of Christ, unless he were certain, that the Priest (when he consecrated
it) did intend to make the body of Christ. If the Priest had his mind wandering
upon any other matter, when he did consecrate (as why may he not have idle and
wandering thoughts as well then, as when he says his prayers?) then by their
own Doctrine, here is no Transubstantiation made; but he that worships the
Sacrament commits idolatry. Secondly, say they were certain there is indeed a
Transubstantiation wrought, yet were this no benefit at all to the receiver:
for (by their own Doctrine) the wicked and reprobate receive with their
bodies, the very flesh and blood of Christ, as well as the Elect; and it is the
spiritual receiving and feeding on him by Faith (not the bodily receiving and
feeding on him) that profits the soul; according to that, it is the spirit
that quickneth, the flesh profits nothing, John 6. 63. Thirdly and lastly, it
is so far from profiting the people of God, that it tends greatly to their
hurt and prejudice: for whereas the Lord, for the singular help of our Faith,
has ordained in the Sacrament, sensible and visible signs and elements, most
fit to represent unto us that invisible grace, which he offers us in it, this
miracle of theirs takes from us those sensible and visible signs, and so
depriues us wholly of that help our Faith might receive by them: For as for
the color, and shape, and taste of the Bread and Wine, which they say, remain
after Transubstantiation, they can be no fit signs to represent unto us the
body and blood of Christ, and that spiritual nourishment and refreshing we
have by it, because there is no analogy or proportion at all between them:
seeing it is not the color, or shape, or taste of those elements, that do
nourish or refresh the body, but the substance of 2.
them only.

Secondly, this should greatly comfort all poor penitent sinners, and
encourage them, to go boldly to Christ for help in all their miseries and
distresses. And in this Doctrine, such may find four notable grounds of
comfort and encouragement: First, if when he was here in the form of a
servant, he was able (though absent in body) to see and take notice of the
misery of this child, and able to relieve and cure him; how much more is he
able to do the like for us now, when he fits at the right hand of his father?
Secondly, if he being on earth, had that compassion even of the bodily wants,
and pains, and miseries of men, as to be troubled and grieved to see the
people continue with him three days and had nothing to eat, Mat. 15. 32. and
to sigh to see a man to be deaf, and to have an impediment in his speech,
Mark 7. 34. if he were then so ready to help and give good success to them,
in the labors of their callings, as he did to Peter and his fellows when they
were fishing, Luke 5. 5, 6. what should move thee to doubt, but he will now
also much more have compassion on thee, and be ready to relieve thee in all thy
wants and distresses; specially in the anguish and misery of thy soul?
Thirdly, if being on earth, he was so ready to offer his help to them in
misery; if in his whole conversation he was then so meek and gentle toward all
men, and all his miracles were done so for the profit of men, that he might
encourage all poor sinners without fear, to come unto him for help: What
should move thee to think, that he will reject thee that come, and seek,
and prayest to him for help in thy distress? Fourthly, if he were so good and
gracious to all sorts (even to wicked men, yea to his enemies; such a one as
Malchus was, Luke 22. 51.) why would thou doubt, that fear to offend him,
and studiest in all things to please him, but he will be much more ready to do
thee good?

The third and last use of this Doctrine is for instruction; that seeing one
end Christ aimed at in curing and helping the bodies of men, was thereby 3.
to draw them to seek to him for help of their souls: therefore the weal
and woe of our bodies should draw us to a consideration and care of the estate
of our souls.

First, If the pain and misery that sin has brought upon the body be so
grievous and intolerable, think what the pain and misery of thy soul will
be, if thou seek not help for it. Pro. 18. 14. A wounded spirit who can
bear? For thy soul has been the fountain, from whence all the sins of thy
body have sprung, Mar. 7. 21. From within out of the heart of men proceed
adulteries, fornications, murders, thests, etc. and thy body has been but as
a servant and instrument to thy soul in these sins.

Secondly, if thou find such sweetness and comfort in the blessings God has
provided for thy body, think how much sweeter and more desirable those
dainties and pleasures are, that he has provided for thy soul; what it is to
be satisfied with the good things of his house, even of his holy Temple; as the
Prophet speaks, Psalm. 65. 4. what that fullness of joy and pleasures are,
which God has prepared for them that love him, in his everlasting Kingdom, in
thy presence is fullness of joy, at thy right hand there are pleasures for
evermore Psalm. 16. 11.

Thirdly, if thou have such care to provide for thy body, that it may be kept
free from all misery, and abound in delights of all sorts; how much more
careful should thou be to provide thus for thy soul? seeing, first, if it
be well provided for and saved, thy body shall be sure to be saved also.
Therefore we shall see, that both our blessed Savior at his death, Luke 23.
46. and Steven also at his, Acts 7. 59. commend only their souls into the
hands of God, and show no care, nor make any mention at all of their bodies.
Secondly, even in this life the welfare of thy body depends on the good estate
of thy soul, ye shall serve the Lord your God, and he shall bless thy bread
and thy water, and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee, Exodus 23.
25. My words are life to those that find them and health to all their flesh,
Pro. 4. 22.

Lecture the ninety seventh. August 20. 1611. JOHN IIII. L.
THe last day we heard, that the first words of this verse, contain in them
the comfort and satisfaction, that this Ruler received from Christ, after he
had been so sharply rebuked by him. And that herein the grace and mercy of
Christ appeared in two points: first, that he showed his divine power, in the
cure even of a bodily infirmity: secondly, that he did this at the request of a
man, that was so weak in Faith as this Ruler was. The former of these we
finished the last day, and now it remains we proceed to the latter; namely,
that the wants and weaknesses of this Ruler notwithstanding, Christ granted his
request, and healed his child. Now that we may the better receive instruction
from this example, we must observe in it these three points: First, the great
ignorance and want of Faith, that was in this Ruler at this time, when he
craved help of Christ for his son. Secondly, the great goodness and respect
that Christ showed unto him, notwithstanding this. Thirdly, the reason why
Christ did show this respect to so ignorant and weak a man. For the first, how
ignorant and weak in faith he was, you shall discern in five points: First,
by the check and reproof that Christ gave him, verse 48. Secondly, in that he
sought not to Christ for help, till all other means failed him, and his
child was even ready to dye, verse 47. Thirdly, that he thought Christ could
not help his son, unless he went down to him, verse 47. 49. he thought, he
must needs either pray with him, or anoint him, or touch him, or use some
other ceremony and solemnity about him, or else he could do him no good; being
in this (as it seems) of Naamans mind, Behold (says he) I thought, he will
surely come out to me and stand, and call on the Name of the Lord his God, and
strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper, 2. Kings 5. 11.
Fourthly, in that he thought it would be to no purpose for Christ to go to his
son, if he were once dead, ver. 49. Fifthly and lastly, being rebuked by Christ
for his infidelity, he regarded it not, nor seems to be at all affected with
it; but was more troubled with his affliction, than with his sin, verse 49.

Now for the goodness and respect that Christ showed unto him notwithstanding,
we may observe it in three points: First, that he expostulateth no further with
him concerning his infidelity, but perceiving that his mind was so oppressed
with grief, that he could not regard, nor be affected with that which was said
concerning his sin; he bears with him in it, and says no more of his sin.
Secondly, that he yields unto his importunity, and heals his son, as he
had desired. Thirdly and lastly, he grants him more than he did desire, or
could hope for at his hands: for whereas he desired only, that he would go
down and heal his son, verse 47 49. and that would have required some time;
Christ does immediately deliver his child from all his pain and danger, and
restores him to health.

And for the Reason that moved Christ to show such respect to this weak man
(which is the third point I told you is to be observed in the Text) though it
were chiefly in himself, even in his own mercy; he showed mercy on him,
because it pleased him so to do, Romans 9. 18. yet had he (doubtless) respect
unto those small seeds and beginnings of Faith and uprightness of heart,
which he discerned in him. He saw, first, that he came to him for help, with
an honest heart, and persuasion that he was able and willing to do him good:
secondly, that he was constant, and importunate, and would not be driven away
by the repulse he received from him. And for this cause had Christ so great
respect unto him, notwithstanding all the faults and weaknesses, that he
discerned in him. Then from these three points, thus observed in the Text, this
Doctrine arises for our instruction:

That the Lord is not wont to reject his servants for any of their infirmities.
True it is, the Lord is not so blinded with affection toward his children,
Doct. 3.
as he cannot see any fault in them; or doteth so upon them, as to delight in
their blemishes; or is so indulgent toward them, as he is loath to grieve and
displease them, as many foolish parents are: for first, he mislikes, and is
displeased even with the least fault he sees in any of his children. Hab. 1.
13. He has pure eyes, and cannot see evil, he cannot behold wickedness. See
this in the angry reproves, that Christ has been wont to give, even to his
best beloved Disciples, even for their ignorance, are ye also yet without
understanding? Do ye not yet understand? Matthew. 15. 16, 17. and for their
weakness of Faith, o faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be
with you? how long shall I suffer you? Matthew. 17. 17. and therefore none that
has grace, may please himself in the least of his corruptions, but ought to
be grieved and humbled for it. Yea, if his children do slip into any foul
faults, he will as sharply correct them, as he will do any other. Amos 3. 2.
You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will
visit you for all your iniquities. See an example of Gods severity toward
Moses, for delaying the circumcision of his son, in the June the Lord met him
and sought to kill him, that is, he did break forth upon him by some grievous
judgment that was so sensible, as both Moses and Zipporah took notice of it
and of the cause of it too, viz. the neglect of circumcising their son, Exodus
4. 24. yea, the Lord will sooner bear with gross sins in others, than with
the appearance and show of evil in his own. The Lord your God is a jealous
God among you, Deuteronomy 6. 15. and a jealous husband, cannot endure so much as the
shows of unchaste love in his wife toward another; in looks, or talk, or
gesture, or secret company. And therefore the nearer any man draws to God in a
profession of piety and religion, the more careful had he need be, to look to
his ways. And he is a mad man, that imagines, because he is a professor, God
will bear with him in his sins. And yet for all this, the goodness of the
Lord is (certainly) wonderful this way, in bearing with his servants, and not
rejecting them for their infirmities: for (besides, that none of all their
frailties shall be imputed unto them to their condemnation, Romans 8. 1.) He
sees no iniquity in Jacob, nor transgression in Israel, Number. 23. 21. He does
so pass by many of the foul infirmities of his children, as he does not so
much as correct them in this life for them, nor check them, nor make any
mention at all of them. And this is surely very admirable, considering how just
the Lord is, and how he hates sin, which made the Prophet to burst forth into
that admiration, Micah 7. 8. Who is a God like to thee, that takes away
iniquity, and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? This
we shall the better believe to be so, by considering three points: First, that
though the Lord hate all sin even in his own servants, and they dislike
themselves for it, yet he likes never the worse of them for their frailties.
Job, we know, showed great impatiency, Job 3. insomuch as afterward, when he
considered how he had carried himself, he says, Chapt. 42. 6. I abhor my
self, and repent in dust and ashes: but God sees no such matter in him, God
counts him a most patient man; when he condemned himself, God justified him,
Ioh 42. 7, 8. and twice charge his friends thus, Ye have not spoken of ^e
the thing that is right, like my servant Job. The like we shall see in David,
he complains of himself, Psalm 40. 12. that his sins were more than the
hairs of his head: therefore his heart failed him. But the Lord had a far
better opinion of him, than he had of himself; for thus God says of him, 1
Reg. 14. 8. that he had followed him with all his heart, and done only that
that was right in his eyes. Secondly, these very works, wherein his servants
have showed much frailty, he has accepted of, and taken them in good part, and
has not been wont to reject the good works they have performed, because of
the corruption they have showed in them, 2. Chron. 6. 8 Whereas it was in thine
heart, to build an house to my Name (says the Lord to David, yet was it
ignorantly and fondly done of him, to purpose such a thing without warrant from
God, as appears, spoke I a word to any of the judges of Israel (whom I
commanded to feed my people) saying, why have ye not built me a house of
Cedars? 1. Chron. 17. 6.) thou did well in that thou wast so minded. The like
to this we may see in a prayer David made, Psalm. 31. 22. I said in my haste, I
am cast out of thy sight (and what more wicked or corrupt thought could any man
have in prayer?) yet mark what follows, Yet thou heardest the voice of my
prayer, when I cried unto thee. God rejected not his prayer, though it were
tainted with so foul a corruption. But what speak we of David? Esaias 64. 6.
All our righteousnesses (says the Church) are like filthy clouts. But does God
therefore reject them? No: first, he accepts them, and takes them in good
part, they are acceptable to God by Jesus Christ, 1. Pet. 2. 5. secondly, he
delights, and takes great pleasure in them, sweet is thy voice, Cant. 2. 14.
thirdly, yea he will also reward them, not only in this life (yet godliness
has promises even of this life, 1. Tim. 4. 8.) but even with the reward of the
inheritance, as the Apostle speaks, Col. 3. 24. When the dead shall be
judged, he will give reward, not only unto his servants the Prophets, and to
his Saints, but to all that fear his Name, both small and great, Apoc. 11. 18.

Thirdly and lastly, he is so far from rejecting his servants for any their
infirmities, that of all other he has most care of them that are most troubled
with their infirmities; he shows most tender respect unto them. In this
respect, it pleases the Lord to compare himself to a careful and good
shepherd, that shows his care most of all toward those sheep, that are
most weak and feeble in the slock. Esaias 40. 11. He shall feed his flock like a
shepherd, he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his
bosom, and shall guide them that are with young. And Ezekiel. 34. 16. I will
seek that which was lost, and bring again that that was driven away, and will
bind up that that was broken, and will strengthen the weak. In this respect
it is said of Christ, Mat. 12. 20. Abruised reed shall he not break, and
smoking flax shall he not quench. See an experiment of this in those two
Apostles, which above all showed most weakness of Faith, Thomas and Peter; and
you shall find Christ showed more tender respect to them two, than to all the
rest. For Peter, Christ was most careful, that his resurrection should be
revealed unto him, Mark 16. 7. Yea, 1. Cor. 15. 5. He was seen first of
Cephas, and then of the twelve: yea, to him specially he gives the commandment
to feed his sheep, Ioh. 21. 15. And for Thomas, see the care Christ had of
him, John 20. 24 -- 26. first, he appeared again to his Disciples, when he
was among them, and for his sake chiefly: secondly, he singles him out from the
rest, and gives him sensible helps and means to confirm his Faith.

The Reasons of this Doctrine are principally two: first, the love that the
Lord bears to our persons through Christ. Genesis 4. 4. God had respect to Reas.
1.
Abell, and to his offering. Through Christ, God is become our father, he
bears a fatherly affection to us; yea a far more tender affection than any
of us that are parents can bear to our little ones, yea a mother may forget to
have compassion upon the son of her womb, yet will I not forget thee, Esaias
49. 15. And yet even we that are evil stand thus affected to our little ones,
that we cannot loath them, or neglect them for any out-breach, or looking
asquint, or any other such like deformity; yea many a thing which in another
man's eye is a great blemish (as the pocke-holes in the face, or such like) to
us seems none at all; yea the weaker and more feeble any of our children are,
the more tender we are over them: And this is much more so with the Lord toward
his children, Psalm. 103. 13. As a father has compassion on his children, so
has the Lord compassion on them that fear him. Mal. 3. 17. I will spare them,
as one spares his own son, that serves him.

The second Reason is the respect the Lord has to the work of his 2.
own spirit that dwells in his children, and to the uprightness of their
heart. Psalm. 51. 6. Behold, thou love truth in the inward affections,
therefore have thou taught me wisdom in the secret of my heart. Uprightness
of heart is the chief work of Gods spirit, therefore David begs this so
earnestly of God that he would renew a right spirit within him, Psalm. 51. 10.
and describes the man whose iniquities God has forgiven to be such a one as
in whose spirit there is no guile, Psalm. 32. 2. Where God discerns this, he
will bear with many other wants. Though Asa had many foul faults, yet is he
for this commended, Asa his heart was perfect with the Lord all his days, 1.
Reg. 15. 14. But on the other side, it is said of Amazia, that (though he had
not so many faults as Asa, but did in many things much better than he, yet) the
Lord rejected him, and made not that account of him, as he did of weak Asa, he
did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not with a perfect
heart, 2. Chro. 25. 2.

The Use of this Doctrine, Before I can deliver it, I must labor to prevent
Use.
the abuse of it. For whereas this is the childrens bread, many dogs, and
whelps will be snatching at it, many a wicked and ungracious man will be ready
to abuse this Doctrine to the blessing of himself in his ungodly ways, and
say, The best have their faults, God is not so severe as to mark every thing
that is said or done amiss, he will bear with the infirmities of his
children, my heart is good, etc. But to such I say, they have nothing to do
with this doctrine; but first, as of the godly I have said, that none of all
their foulest sins shall ever be imputed to them: so to thee I say, that all,
even the least sin that ever thou committedst, shall be laid to thy charge,
know thou that for all these things, God will bring thee to judgment, Eccles.
11. 9. of every idle word that such men shall speak, they shall give account
at the day of Judgment, Matthew. 12. 36. Secondly, As the duties the godly have
performed, even those that have been most full of blemishes, shall be accepted
and rewarded; so the very best things* that ever thou did, are abominable to
God, and shall increase thy condemnation, the sacrifice of the wicked is an
abomination to the Lord, Pro. 15. 8. Thirdly, As the foulest sin that ever a
godly man fell into, was but his infirmity, so the least offense that ever thou
committedst is a reigning sin. And because thou comfortest thy self so much in
this, that the godlyest have their faults, and thy sins are but thine
infirmities; I will show thee sundry differences between the faults of the
godly, and thy sins, between the infirmities of the one, and the reigning sins
of the other.

First, Before the committing of it; The regenerate man does not commit any
foul sin with purpose and premeditation of heart, but he is overtaken
before he be aware, and slippeth suddenly into it through the violence of
tentation. Thus Paul describes the sin of a regenerate man, Gal. 6. 1. If
any be fallen by occasion, overtaken with any fault. So David speaks of
himself, Psalm. 39. 22. I said in my haste, I am cast out of thy presence, and
116. 11. I said in my haste, all men are liars. The purpose and desire and
resolution of the heart in every regenerate man, is to please God in all
things. Esaias 26. 8. The desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the
remembrance of thee. See an example of this in two that fell into the foulest
sins, of any regenerate man we read of in Scripture, David and Peter. What the
purpose and full resolution of David's heart was, you may see, Psalm. 119. 106. I
have sworn, and will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.
How fell he then into so foul a sin? Surely he was suddenly overtaken with
some passion of lust before he was aware, and so he fell. So likewise of Peter
we may see, what the full purpose and resolution of his heart was, Matthew. 26.
33. 35. Though all men should be offended by thee, yet will I never be
offended: though I should die with thee, yet I will not deny thee. How fell he
then into so foul a sin? Surely he was suddenly overtaken with a passion of
fear, before he was aware, and so he fell. Now it is quite contrary with the
unregenerate man; For he fears not to sin, Pro. 14. 16. The fool rages and
is careless, he commits sin with prepensed purpose and determination of heart.
Psalm 364. He imagines mischief on his bed; he sets himself upon a way
that is not good, and does not abhor evil, Romans 13. 14. He takes thought for
the flesh to fulfill the lusts of it. Yea (as if their inclination to evil by
nature were not strong enough) They draw on Iniquity with cords of vanity, and
sin as with cart ropes, Esaias 5. 18.

The second difference is in the diverse disposition of their heart, even at
that time when they do sin. The regenerate man never falls totally into any
sin, nor commits it with the whole sway of his soul, with full consent of
his will. But when the flesh tempts and draws him to sin, the spirit
resists the motion, and draws another way, even when they sleep their heart
waketh, Cant. 5. 2. 1. John 3. 9. He that is borne of God sins not, neither
can he sin; because the seed of God remains in him. Gal. 5. 17. The flesh
lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; and these are
contrary one to another; so that ye cannot do the same things that ye would.
He obeyes sin as the slave does his master. Romans 7. 14. This (though it be not
always felt by himself, yet) to another that is a spiritual man, it will
appear by two notes:

1. Try them even when they are at the worst, and some grace will appear in
them; blow away the ashes, and ye shall discern some sparkles of grace in
them, see this in David's readiness to yield to the reproof of Nathan and to
confess his sin even when he had fallen so fearfully, and lain so long in
his sin, 2. Sam. 12. 13. And in praying and crying to God, and calling him most
affectionately his God, even when he thought (in his passion and tentation)
that God had forsaken him, Psalm. 22. 1. As if thou come to the poor distressed
Christian, that complains he is but an hypocrite, and vtters many words,
sauouring of nothing but infidelity and despair; and ask him whether he be
not afraid to offend God, and love not his children, etc. and he cannot deny
this; or if he do, yet may thou evidently discern, that he speaks falsely
against himself.

2. Observe them, and thou shall find their joy is not as it has bin, after
once they have yielded to the temptation, that made David cry, Make me to hear
joy and gladness that the bones that thou have broken, may rejoice, Psalm. 51.
8. so we shall find the two Disciples that were going to Emaus, when they
began to doubt and waver, were made sad in heart by it, Luke 24. 17. It is with
them in this case as it was with Rebecca when she felt the two twins struggling
with her, Genesis 25. 22. When they say, they have no Faith nor Grace in them,
ask them whence then comes this sorrow, and palenesse, and loss of sleep,
etc. Now the wicked man is of a quite contrary disposition: for he is all
flesh, and has no such resistance in himself, (unless it be, first, from the
light of his natural conscience, for the effect of the Law is written in their
hearts, as the Apostle speaks, Romans 2. 15. or, secondly, from the
repugnancy of his lusts between themselves, their lusts war in their members,
James 4. 1.) Luke 11. 27. All things are at peace: he sins willingly, and with
all his heart, John 8. 44. Ye are of your father the Devil, and the lusts of
your father you will do.

A third difference is the diverse disposition of heart, after they have
committed sin: For the godly is wont to find much pain and grief in his
heart, much remorse of conscience, even for the smallest sins he has
committed against God; as we see in David, his heart smote him for cutting off
the skirt of Saul's garment, and for giving commandment for the numbering of the
people, 1. Sam. 24. 6. 2. Sam. 24. 10. and in Paul, the remnants of original
sin in him, made him cry out, o wretched man that I am, etc. Romans 7. 24. If
sin be an infirmity, it will put the heart to this pain, as all bodily
infirmities will the body. And though David lay long in his sin, before he
could recover himself by sound repentance, yet from the day he committed his
sin, this remorse began in him, and he never found true joy again, till he had
effectually repented, Psalm. 51. 8. Now it is not so with the wicked, but after
many foul and heinous sins their hearts are as quiet, and as iocund as before:
An example of this we have in Joseph's brethren, after they had conspired to
slay him and (being dissuaded from it) had stripped him of his cote and cast him
into a pit, they sat down to eat bread, Genesis 37. 24, 25.

Another difference there is in the diverse disposition of their hearts, after
they have committed sin; which is the fourth and last difference. The godly
cannot continue in sin, but after he has fallen, he rises again: yea, he
obtains further strength against his corruption, and power to forsake his
sin; so that he will not be so apt to fall into it again, as he was before.
True it is, a regenerate man may fall into the same sin again, neither can
any man define how often, and into how heinous sins a man that is soundly
regenerate may fall: yet do we not find, that any child of God has fallen
often into the same heinous and scandalous sins. Indeed, in a smaller slip of
concealing his wife, and causing her to say she was his sister, we find
Abraham taken twice, Genesis 12. 13. and 20. 2.

But for their foul sins we shall find, that Noah was never drunk but
once; nor David committed adultery but once; neither Peter returned ever again
to his Apostasy; nor Paul to his persecution, after they had once repented.
This is expressly said of Judah, after he truly saw his sin, he knew Tamar
again no more, Genesis 38. 26. Secondly, it is made a property of them that are
in Christ Jesus, in the state of grace, that they walk not after the flesh,
Romans 8, verse 1. Though they cannot kill or restrain all outward lusts, yet
they are made able to keep them from reigning in them, so as willingly to obey
it in the lusts thereof, as the Apostle speaks, Romans 6. 12. but they (by
little and little, at the least in the unfeigned desire and endeavor of their
hearts) do mortify the deeds of the body by the spirit, Romans 8. 13. And it is
a shrewd sign, that it reigns, when it has once the body at command, which
made the Apostle say, Let not sin reign in your mortal bodies, neither yield
you your members as instruments of vnrightonsnes unto sin, Romans 6. 12, 13. On
the other side, he is called an enemy of God, that (Psalm. 68. 21.) goes on in
sin. And 2. Pet. 2. 19. its made a note of a graceless man, when he cannot
cease from fin. The Reason is plain, because the virtue of Christ's death is
never separated from the merit of it. When the merit of it is effectual to
justification, and pardon of sin, then the virtue of it is effectual to
sanctification, and to the destroying of the power of sin, when once the Lord
has sprinkled clean water upon us, and (through the imputation of Christ's
sufferings and righteousness) made us clean; when he has thereby cleansed us
from all the filthiness of our sins, then he will also give us a new heart
and a new spirit he will put into us, he will take the stony heart out of us,
and give us a heart of flesh, Ezekiel. 36. 25, 26. He so speaks peace unto his
people, and to his Saints, that they may not turn again unto folly, Psalm. 85.
8. Now the unregenerate man continues and walks in sin; yea, like the
dropsy man, the more he sins the more he may: one foul sin, being as a
shooing-horne, to draw on another.

Lecture the ninety eighth. August 27. 1611. JOHN IIII. L.
NOw (having the last day, prevented the mistaking and abuse of it) it remains
that we proceed to the Uses, that are to be made of this Doctrine, and they are
principally three:

The first is for instruction, to teach us, that for as much as the Lord
reiects 1.
none of his children for their infirmities, but loves and esteems of them
nevertheless for their weakness: Therefore we should learn, not to despise
or reject any child of God, because of his infirmities: for therein the
perfection of a Christian shall appear, even in following and striving to be
like his heavenly father, Matthew. 5. 45. And we are his children, when we
resemble him, and are of his disposition, be ye therefore followers of God as
de are children, Epes. 5. 1. And will any of us seem to be holier than God? to
dislike sinners more than he does? That were gross hypocrisy.

Object. But you will say, there is small consequence in this reason: seeing
they that are Gods children, and upright in heart, are perfectly known to him,
so are they not to us. If we knew who were Gods Elect, and who had upright
hearts indeed, we would hold our selves bound to love and bear with all such,
notwithstanding many weaknesses that we discerned in them; but we know the
world is full of hypocrites, that will make a good profession, and yet have but
false hearts.

Answ. I answer, that if a man profess the fear of God, and his course of
life be agreeable thereunto, though he have many frailties, we are bound to
esteem him the child of God. Rom 8. 1. They are in Christ Jesus that walk
not after the flesh. And 1. Sam. 16. 7. Man judges according to the outward
appearance. And though we may well be deceived in this, because men's hearts are
deceitful, Ier. 17. 9. yet this is a safe and holy error, I may say: Our
judgment, though it be erroneous in this, yet it is the judgment of true
charity: and therefore such as God commands, and we may have comfort in 1. Cor.
13. 5. It thinks not evil, verse 7. It believes all things, it hops all
things. Now it cannot be denied, but in many of these there be sundry
infirmities; in some, error in judgment; in other, much frowardness,
unthankfulness, pride: nay, in some, foul faults and slips in their
conversation. I say not, that thou art bound to think well of all that
professors do: No, we heard the last day, the Lord favors not the faults of
his dearest children.

But three duties thou owe to every one, that so profess the fear of God.

First, thou must delight, and gladly take notice of the good things that are
in him; observe him well, to see if you can discern any one testimony of
soundness of heart, any one sign of the life of grace, and gladly take notice
of it, Let us consider one another says the Apostle, Heb. 10. 24. and 1. Cor.
16. 17, 18. Having spoken of the excellent things that were in Stephanus,
Fortunatus, and Achaicus, he charge the Church, that they should know, or
acknowledge, such men. Therefore it is to be wished, that Christians, when they
meet, would exercise themselves so, as they might have proof of that grace
that is in each other: and this would exceedingly increase love.

Secondly, because if he do in any measure soundly fear God, thou art bound
to honor him in thine heart, Psalm. 15. 4. None shall go to heaven that cannot
honor them that fear the Lord. Therefore you must not be glad, but loath to
see or hear of his faults or infirmities. Thou should do to every child of
God, because thou art bound to honor him, as Sem and Iaphet did to Noah,
because they were bound to honor him, Genesis 9. 23. cover his nakedness. Every
one of us should count it a foul corruption in our nature, be ashamed of it,
bewail it to God, and strive against it, that we are so like the Beetle or
Horse-flie, that if he fly into a field that is never so full of sweet
flowers, yet if there be but a little filthy dung in it, his eye and sent is
only to that, and upon that only will he light. So are we apt to pass by all
the good things that are in any Christian, but his slips and infirmities we
gladly observe, we hear and inquire of them with great delight. Matthew 7. 3.
And why see thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye, etc.

Why art thou so curious an obseruer of his smallest infirmities? And yet this
is not the corruption of wicked men only, but even of the professors of Gods
truth, that they hear nothing, they talk of nothing so willingly, as they do
of the faults of others, even of their brethren. Psalm. 50. 20. Thou sit and
speak against thy brother, etc. There is no talk that men will sit so long
at, and so willingly as this. Pro. 18. 8. The words of a talebearer are as
flatteries, and they go down to the bowels of the belly. O if the Lord should
so gladly pry into all the faults of his servants, as we that are
fellow-seruants, do into the infirmities one of another, who were able to abide
it? Psalm. 130. 3. If thou, O Lord, shall straightly mark iniquities, O Lord,
who shall stand? Let us therefore in this also show our selves the children of
our heavenly father; that as he does unwillingly see the faults of his
children, he has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, Number. 23. 21. and passes by
many of their transgressions, Micah 7. 18. so let us learn to do. Let us be
loath to see and hear of the infirmities of Gods servants.

Thirdly, thou must take heed, that when his infirmities and faults be such, as
thou can not choose but take notice of, then that thou despise him not, nor
reject him for his infirmities: not for error in judgment, Let not him that
eats despise him that eats not; and let him that eats not judge him that
eats. Why do thou judge thy brother? or why do thou set at naught thy
brother? Romans 14. 3. 10. not for infirmities and slips in his life and
conversation. Mat. 18. 10. See that ye despise not one of these little ones.
Where our Savior calls the faithful so, neither in respect of their stature,
as verse 2. nor in respect of their poverty and contemptible estate in the
world, but in respect of their many errors and infirmities; as is plain by
the comparison he uses, verse. 12. It is not lawful to despise so little and
mean a Christian, as (through his errors and falls) is like unto a stray and
lost sheep. And mark our Saviors reason for this, verse. 10. Because God
despises them not, but makes great account of them, and has appointed his
Angels to guard and attend them: yea verse 11. he sent his Son into the world,
chiefly for their sakes; therefore must we take heed we despise them not. Now
it is certain, that many offend this way, that take themselves to be right
good Christians; they that pretend great love and respect to good men, and even
to all them that fear God, yet will be found to be despisers of these little
ones. This will appear evidently in three things.

First, by the aptness that is in Christians, to judge one another. If any
differ from them in judgment, but even in the controversies of our Church,
about matters of ceremony. If we discern in any professor never so little
frowardness, or unthankfulness, or pride, or such like corruption (though
both the one and the other do profess the fear of God, not in word only, but
in their whole conversation) straight we are apt to conclude, surely he is but
a carnal man, he is but an hypocrite, there is no soundness or sincerity of
heart in him. Now this is a plain despising of Christ's little ones. When the
Apostle had said, Romans 14. 34. Let not him that eats, despise him that eats
not: he adds presently, And let not him that eats not, judge him that eats:
for God has received him. Who art thou that condemnest another man's servant?
he stands or falls to his own master.

The second sign of this is, the aptness that is in Christians, to estrange
themselves one from another in affection, in countenance, in society, for every
small infirmity they discern one in another. This is also a plain despising
of Christ's little ones, and a spice of that foul sin, that the Prophet notes
in the hypocrites of his time, Esaias 65. 5. Which say, Stand apart, come not
near me: for I am holier then thou. Of our Savior we read, that though his
kinsfolks, and all the company that met at the wedding in Cana of Galile, were
addicted to the superstitious purifications of the Jews, yet did not he for
that their error in judgment and practice, shun their company and society,
John 2. 6. And of the first Christians in the Primitive Church it is said, Acts
2. 42. that as they did join together in the Apostles Doctrine, and
fellowship, and breaking of bread, and prayers; so they were not strange one to
another, but maintained a sweet fellowship and society together. verse. 46. They
did eat their meat together with gladness, and singleness of heart. And so
should we (doubtless) do upon the same ground. Certainly, they that are of the
same mind in all substantial points of Religion, and are enliued and guided
by the same spirit of grace, ought not to be strange one unto another. Not love
only, but brotherly kindness is required of us one toward another, 2. Peter
1. 7.

A third sign of this is, the general neglect of all means, to reclaim or
strengthen a weak brother: we are apt to observe every fault in a weak
brother, to dislike him for it, to speak of it also to others; but neither by
prayer to God, nor by brotherly admonition will we seek to reclaim him. This
is a plain despising of Christ's little ones, count him not as an enemy, but
admonish him as a brother, 2 Thessalonians. 3 15. we count him not as a brother, but
as an enemy, whom we refuse to admonish. Now because this is so general a
fault, and such a fault, as greatly hinders not only the love that should be
among us, and the comfort that Christians might find in their mutual society,
but also the growth of grace and religion in the Church; I will therefore show
you out of Gods Word, by what means every one of us may master and sudue this
corruption in our selves.

The first is, the consideration of the commandment of God, whereby we are so
often and straightly charged, to show our love and tender respect to Christ's
little ones. We know it is often made a certain note of one that is in the state
of grace, when he can love the brethren, when he can love a Christian, because
he is a Christian; and he that loves not his brother, abides in death, 1.
John 3. 14. Now this is no certain argument, that we love the brethren, when
we can love and esteem such, as excel in grace (for so far forth many a
wicked man has loved Gods servants, Herod himself reverenced and esteemed of
John, Mar. 6. 20.) but therein appears the truth of our love, when we can love
such a one as we know to be a brother, though we do see sundry faults and
infirmities in him. The loving of all the Saints, is often noted for an argument
of this true love, Ephesians. 1. 15. Col. 1. 4. Phil. 1. 5. Mark therefore how often
we are charged with this respect to the weak Christian, him-that is weak in
the faith receive you, Romans 14. 1. we that are strong ought to bear with the
infirmities of the weak, Romans 15. 1. Take heed lest by any means this
liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak, 1. Cor. 8 9.
If any be overtaken in a fault (through infirmity) ye that are spiritual,
restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, Gal. 6. 1. support the weak,
1 Thessalonians. 5. 14.

Secondly, the consideration of this, how many and how gross infirmities may
be in a man, whose heart yet is found and upright before God. If thou knew a
man to be Gods child, and a temple of the Holy Ghost, thou durst not but love
him, and esteem well of him; but thou can not be persuaded, that such and
such, in whom thou see so many faults, can possibly be Gods children.
Consider therefore, and weigh this well, that a man may be the child of God,
and soundly regenerate, and yet have many strange infirmities in him. A man may
be very ignorant of many truths; yea, though he have never so many means to
inform him in the truth, he may be long ere he can be persuaded of many
truths, and yet be Gods child: of all the elect Apostles it is said even after
Christ's resurrection as yet they knew not the Scripture, that he must rise
again from the dead, John 20. 9. See also what pride and ambition was in James
and John, Mar. 10. 37. what strange peevishness and frowardness was in
Barnabas, Acts 15. 39. See how impatient Job was, Job 3. 1. and how
rebelliously Jonah murmured against God, Jonah 4. 3. 8, 9. how Peter and
Barnabas both dissembled, Gal. 2. 13.

These things I repeat, not to encourage or give comfort unto any, that live
securely in any of these or the like sins: For, first, he that does so, sins
presumptuously, and has cause to fear, God will never be merciful unto him,
Deuteronomy. 29. 19. specially, when he stumbles at the Word, and makes that a Bawd to
his sin, and an imboldner of him in it, 1. Pet. 2. 8. Secondly, none of
these, whom I have named, did walk in these sins, nor wallow in them. But I
speak this, only to stay men from judging rashly of other men, for their
faults. Surely, if we should see in any that profess Religion, far less
faults then these that I have named, we would be ready to cry, Are these your
professors? Fie upon these hypocrites; for shame follow Sermons no longer;
carry the Bible no longer under thy arm. But stay thy self, man, and say as
Psalm. 73. 15. If I say, I will judge this, behold, I should offend against the
generation of thy children.

The third means to preserve us from rash judgment, is the serious
consideration of our own frailties, how many and gross they have been, and
that even since the time of our calling. This remedy we shall find prescribed,
Iam. 3. 1. My brethren, be not many masters, or teachers: and mark the reason,
which he prescribes as a remedy, Ver. 2. For in many things we finne all. So,
Gal. 6. when he had said Ver. 2. Bear ye one another burden, he adds, Ver.
3. For if any man seem to himself that he is somewhat, when he is nothing, he
deceives himself. And Ver. 4. Let every man prove his own work. Mat. 5. 5.
He that is poor in spirit, and can see, and mourn for his own sins, will
be meek: that is, void of pride and malice against others. Mat. 7. 5.
Hypocrite, first pull out the beam out of thine own eye.

The fourth remedy against this corruption, is, the evils and dangers that a
man shall draw upon himself by this sin; and those I find to be principally
three: First, thou shall be sure to find others, that will be as apt to
censure, and mislike, and slander, and judge thee, as thou have been to do thus
unto thy brother; that will have as little care of thy credit, as thou have had
of the credit of thy brother. This is plain, Matthew. 7. 1, 2. and Luke 6. 38.
it is said, that men shall mete the same measure to us again, that we have
measured to other men. Secondly, this will provoke the Lord to leave thee to
thy self, and to give thee over to the power of the like temptation, whereby
thy brother was drawn to evil: this reason the Apostle gives, Considering thy
self, lest thou also be tempted, Gal. 6. 1. And certainly to this may many
impute their own foul slips, that they were so rigorous and extreme in the
censuring of the frailties of their brethren, when themselves seemed to stand.
Thirdly, this will provoke the Lord to be more sharp and extreme in his
judgment upon thee: His Lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormenters,
till he should pay all that was due unto him, Matthew. 18. 34. He shall have
judgment without mercy that has showed no mercy, Iam. 2. 13. Whereas therefore
the best of us have cause to pray, as Psalm. 143. 2. Enter not into judgment
with thy servant, for in thy sight shall no man living be justified: let us be
more sparing and charitable in censuring of our brethren.

Lecture the ninety ninth. September. 3. 1611. JOHN IIII. L.
IT follows that we come now to the two other uses that are to be made of the
Doctrine that we heard the last day.

The second use then that this Doctrine serves unto, is for the comfort and
encouragement of all the godly. It may make them cheerful and comfortable at
all times, in all the occasions of their life. And this encouragement the best
of Gods servants have need of; for we shall find by experience, that many who
have greatest care to serve God, and to please him in all things, have sadder
hearts, and are subject more to fears than any others. And if we enquire into
the cause of it, we shall find, it grows from this principally, that the
conscience of their many frailties and infirmities, puts them into
continual fear, that they are not in Gods favor, that he accepts nothing
that they do. This has been the old complaint of Gods people, Esa. 49. 14.
Zion said, the Lord has forsaken me, and my Lord has forgotten me. Now we
have heard in this Doctrine, that if a man have in him the least dram of saving
grace, if he be able to say, he is no hypocrite, though he have many frailties,
his heart is upright, then may he assure himself, that the Lord will not reject
him, nor like the worse of him for any of his infirmities, as the Lord
answers his people in the same place, Can a woman forget her sucking child,
that she should not have compassion of the son of her womb? yea, they may
forget, yet will I not forget thee, Esa. 49. 15. so that such a one is bound to
strive against the heaviness and vncheerfulnesse of his own heart, and to say
to his soul as David does, Psalm. 4^. 11. Why art thou cast down, O my soul,
and why art thou disquieted within me? True it is, that every Christian man
has in himself cause enough of sorrow, and he ought to mourn, not only for
every evil action that he has committed through infirmity, but even for the
wants and corruptions that he espieth in his best works: for so did Paul, even
for this cause, O wretched man that I am, says he, Romans 7. 24. Yea, he is
only an happy man, he only shall find true comfort that is able so to mourn,
Mat. 5. 4. yet has he not so much cause of sorrow in himself, as he has to
rejoice in the Lord: yea it is a greater sin not to rejoice in Gods
goodness, than not to mourn for his own corruption. Therefore it is very
well worth the observing, how often and with what earnestness this duty is
enjoined the faithful by the Lord, Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice ye
righteous; and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart, Psalm. 32. 11.
Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord, Phil. 3. 1. Rejoice in the Lord
always, and again I say rejoice, Phil. 4. 4. Rejoice evermore, 1 Thessalonians. 5.
16. To conclude therefore this first encouragement, I would have these men to
consider: First, they dispraise the Lord their Master much, by being so heavy
and uncomfortable. As the King that Nehemiah served, could not abide to see his
servants sad, Neh. 2. 1. no more can the Lord; he delights in the peace and
comfort of his servants, Psalm. 35. 27. and is much offended with them, if they
serve him not with ioyfulnesse, and with a good heart, considering how
bountiful and good a Master he is, Deuteronomy. 28. 47. Secondly, that they discredit
their Masters service, and do what lies in them to alienate men's hearts from
the liking of it. And indeed, what one thing causes natural men more to
dislike Religion, than this? whereas God makes this the only privilege of
his servants, and that that should greatly commend his service unto men, Esa.
65. 13, 14. that when others shall be ashamed, and cry, and howl, his servants
shall rejoice and sing.

The second encouragement that this Doctrine yields to the godly, is this: It
may make them willing and desirous to serve the Lord, to the uttermost of their
endeavor, and even to thrust and enforce themselves gladly to do him any
service. The most men we see do fly Gods service, and count it more base and
painful, than any bondage and drudgerie in the world, as the Israelites did
esteem the house of God, to be an house of greater bondage and misery, than
Egypt it self, Were it not better for us to return into Egypt, say they,
Numb. 14. 3. Yea, we shall find, that Gods own children have often times no
heart at all to do him that service, that he requires; but are ready to shift
it off, as Jonah did, Ion. 1. 2, 3. and the chief thing that alienateth man's
heart from religious duties, is this; That men find they cannot perform them
in that manner that God requires; and therefore they have no heart to do any
thing at all. It was the excuse that the unprofitable servant made for his
idleness, and doing nothing in his Masters service, I knew thee, that thou art
a hard man, says he, Matthew. 25. 24. And indeed, if the Lord our God were so
hard and strict a Master, as would accept of no service, unless it were done
in all points according to his commandment, and would bear with no frailties
and infirmities in his servants, what mortal man could serve him with any
comfort and delight? True it is, and it cannot be denied, that that to the
natural man it is utterly impossible, to do that service God requires. That
which our Savior speaks of the covetous man, may be said also of the
voluptuous, proud, malicious, and ignorant man, Luke 18. 25. It is easier for a
Camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for him to enter into the
Kingdom of God. Yea, it is certain, that even to the regenerate man, Gods
service is painful, and full of difficulty. This we shall find said of the
first degree of it: viz. the forsaking of our selves, and of all known sins.
If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross
daily, and follow me, Luke 9. 23. Resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite
thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also; and is any man will sue
thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also, Mat. 5.
29, 30. And the like may be said of every spiritual duty. To say a prayer is
an easy thing; but no man can pray aright without great striving and labor,
Lift up thy prayer, Esa. 37. 4. Unto thee O Lord do I lift up my soul, Psalm.
25. 1. Strive together with me in your prayers to God for me, Romans 15. 30. To
sit at a Sermon an hour is an easy thing; but to hear, as we ought to hear,
is a painful thing; to incline our ear, and to apply our heart, Pro. 2. 2.
And in a word, to make a profession of Religion, as most men do, has no
hardness in it; but the whole course of his life, that is a Christian indeed,
and not in show only, is called by our Savior, a striving to enter in at the
strait gate, Luke 13. 24. But yet, if we knew well the disposition of this
Master whom we serve, and in what manner he requires service of us, we would
confess, that his service has neither any impossibility nor hardness in it
at all; but we would acknowledge that to be most true, which both our Savior
and the Apostle speak of, Mat. 11. 30. My yoke is easy, and my burden is
light. 1 Ioh. 5 3* His commandments are not grievous. Yea, we would account
his service the most perfect freedom, and esteem it to be the greatest
happiness in the world, to be admitted unto it. That which the Queen of Sheba
spoke of Salomons servants, may much more fitly be spoken of them that serve
the Lord, 1 Reg. 10. 8. Happy are thy men, and happy are these servants, which
stand continually before thee. When God first established his Worship under the
Law, the people did so strive, who should be most forward in serving him (even
to the parting with of their goods by contributing to his Tabernacle) as that
Moses was feign by solemn proclamation to stay them, Exodus 36. 6. And in the
first times of the Gospel, men were so forward in offering themselves to serve
God in the work of the Ministry (though that calling was then subject to much
more hardness and danger, than now it is) and women also were so forward in
offering themselves to serve him, in the office of Church-Widowes, (which, you
know, required much base and painful service) that the Apostle was feign to
give charge, not to admit all that so offered themselves; but such only as were
qualified according to his direction, 1 Timothy 3. and 5. And surely, if we knew
our Masters disposition well, we would all be as forward and desirous to thrust
our selves into his service, as they were; for one hour that we have been wont
to spend in his service, we would willingly spend three. Yea, the more time our
calling would permit us to spend in his service, the happier would we count our
selves: according to that, Psalm. 84. 4. Blessed are they that dwell in thy
house, they will be always praising thee. Consider therefore, and think often
(for thy encouragement) of the gracious disposition of thy Lord and Master: and
that in these four points.

First, he stands not so much upon our actions, as upon our affections;
though we be able to do very little, yet if he discern in us an unfeigned
desire to do well, he is ready to accept us, Is there be first a willing mind,
it is accepted, 2 Cor. 8. 12. He accepts the will as the deed: Because
Abraham was willing and ready to have offered up his son in sacrifice to God,
the Holy Ghost says of him, that he did offer him up, Heb. 11. 17. And for
this cause Paul says of Aquila and Priscilla, that for his life they laid down
their own necks, Romans 16. 4.

Secondly, he much more esteems of this unfeigned desire of our heart to do
better, than if we could do any thing never so well, when he sees us willing,
and sorry that we can do no better: The Apostle praises the Macedonians for
this, that their will exceeded their ability, 2 Cor. 8. 3. So does he the
Corinthians, that they had begun before, not only to do, but also to be
willing and forward a year ago, 2 Cor. 8. 10.

Thirdly, if he see our heart set and resolved to do his will, in any duty he
has enjoined us, he will be ready to help us, and make that easy to us,
which was full of difficulty and impossibility before: Draw nigh to God, and he
will draw nigh to you, Iam. 4. 8. Arise, and be doing, and the Lord shall be
with thee, 1 Chronicles. 22. 16. Deal courageously, and the Lord shall be with the
good, 2 Chro. 19. 11.

Fourthly, with how much the more labor and difficulty he finds we have
served him in any duty, and by how many the more tentations and lets we have
striuen against, in doing of it, by so much the more acceptable shall our
service be unto him, God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of
love, Heb. 6. 10. And who would not be glad to serve such a Master?

The third and last encouragement that this Doctrine yields to the godly, is
this, that it may cause them to sing at their work, and to take much 3.
comfort, even in the poorest service they are able to do unto God. A
wonderful thing it is to see, how little joy men take in good duties; and the
true cause of it is this, that they are apt to doubt, when they do any good
duty, they do it not well, nor in that manner as they ought; and if they epsy
any infi mitie and corruption of the flesh, that mixeth it self with the ^orke
of the spirit in any good action they have done, (though they have striuen
against it, and grieved sor it) they are straight apt to think, that God will
judge of their work according to that corruption, and reject it. True it is,
and cannot be denied, but that the godly may find cause enough in themselves
to be humbled, even for their best actions when they have performed them, and
to cry with Nehemiah, Remember O my God concerning this, and spare me according
to the greatness of thy mercy, Neh. 13. 22. and they have also cause of fear
before they undertake them, nay it is not possible we should do any good duty
well, unless we do it in fear. None of us can preach well, unless we
undertake this business with fear least we should not do it well, and approve
our selves to God: in it Paul professes of himself, that he was (in the
exercise of his Ministry among the Corinthians) with them in weakness, and in
fear, and in much trembling, 1 Cor. 2. 3. None of you can hear well, unless
you come with fear and reverence, unless ye be humbled at the Lords feet to
receive his word, Deuteronomy. 33. 3. Paul praises the Corinthians for this, and
says, Titus ioyed much to see it in them, that they received the doctrine and
Ministry of Titus with fear and trembling, 2 Cor. 7. 15. In a word, we cannot
pray or do any other religious duty well, unless we undertake it in fear,
lest we should not perform it as we ought, Serve the Lord with fear, Psalm. 2.
11. Let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably, with reverence, and
godly fear, Heb. 12. 28. Nay we cannot conscionably and well perform any duty
in our Christian conversation, unless we do it in fear: Servants must obey
their masters with fear and trembling, Ephesians. 6. 5. Yet as there must be in us
this fear rising from the apprehension of the Lords holiness, and our own
great insufficiency to do any good duty; so must there be in us joy and
gladness of heart, rising from the consideration of the Lords goodness, and
readiness to take in good part the poor service we do unto him. There must be
in us in every service we do unto God, these two contrary affections; fear,
in respect of our own unworthiness and insufficiency; joy and gladness of
heart, in respect of the gracious disposition of the Master whom we do service
unto. This is that the Prophet means, Psalm. 2. 11. Serve the Lord with fear,
and rejoice with trembling. We should come with cheerful and glad hearts to
his service, Serve the Lord with gladness, come before his presence with
singing: enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with
praise; be thankful unto him, and bless his name. For the Lord is good, his
mercy is everlasting, and his truth endures unto all generations, Psalm. 100.
2, 4, 5. and so should we depart from it. And three Reasons there be may move
us to do so.

1 He will not straightly mark, but pass by and pardon many infirmities in
our service we do to him with upright hearts, Who is a God like unto thee that
pardons iniquity, and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his
heritage: he retains not his anger for ever, because he delights in mercy,
Mic. 7. 18. If thou Lord should mark iniquities: O Lord, who shall stand!
But there is forgiveness with thee that thou may be feared. I wait for the
Lord, my soul does wait, and I trust in his word. Let Israel hope in the Lord,
for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption, Psalm.
130. 3, 4, 5, 7.

2 He does not exact of us that we utterly banish all corruption, so as it may
not dwell in us, but only that we should not suffer it to reign in us, Rom 6.
12.

3 He not only accepts and takes in good part the poorest service we do to
him, notwithstanding our corruptions and frailties, but even delights and
takes great pleasure in them, Cant. 2. 14. He accounts all our good works
as the fruit of the Vine, Esa. 5. 4. Yea, it cannot choose but be so; for,
Christ casts of his odours into them, and so presents them to his Father,
Reu. 8. 3.

Lecture the hundredth. September. 10. 1611. JOHN IIII. L.
IT follows now that we come to the third and last Use that is to be made of
the former Doctrine, and that is, to exhort every man, that for as much as the
Lord has such gracious respect to all his servants, in whom he does discern
truth and uprightness of heart: he will bear much with them, and accept of
them and their services, notwithstanding all their infirmities; that therefore
we would every one of us labor by diligent trial, and examination of our
selves, to find that there is this truth and uprightness in our hearts. Now
to stir up my self and you all to this care; let us consider these three
things. First, the blessed estate and condition of that man, who is sound and
upright in heart. Secondly, the dangerous estate of the man that is an
hypocrite, and has a false heart. Thirdly, the difficulty of discerning the
uprightness of the heart, and putting a difference between him that is an
hypocrite, and him that is upright in heart. And for the first, the man that
knows his heart void of hypocrisy, though he have many 1.
weaknesses and frailties, may be sure that he is Gods child, and may be out of
doubt that he is in Gods favor, and that nothing shall ever be able to
separate him from the love of God. It is often said, the Lord valueth and
esteems of every man's actions, according to the heart they proceed from. Ier.
17. 10. I the Lord search the heart, and try the reins, even to give every
one according to his ways. 1 Reg. 8. 39. Be merciful, and do, and give to
every man according to all his ways, as thou know his heart. He accepts
Abels sacrifice, not Cains; Abraham's laughing, not Sarah's; Mary's question,
not Zacharies; esteems more of a cup of cold water that one gives, than of
many thousands that another gives, of the widows two mites, more than of all
that the rich men cast into the treasury, Luke 21. 3, 4. And when the Holy
Ghost speaks thus, his meaning is to say, God esteems every man according
to that grace he discerns in him; the man that has any saving grace in him,
he acknowledges for his own; and the words and actions that proceed from his
grace and spirit, he will accept of. In this respect, they that have received
the Spirit of God, are said to have the Lords mark, Ezekiel. 9. 4. and the Lords
seal upon them, Ephesians. 4. 30. But why is this respect that God has to the grace
of his Spirit, called, the beholding of the heart, the respecting of the heart?
Surely, because the heart is the chief and most proper seat of Gods grace, and
of the spirit of regeneration in every man; the seed of God is sown in the
furrows of the heart, 1 Ioh. 3. 9. Therefore also is the regenerate part
called often the inner man, Romans 7. 22. 2 Cor. 4. 16. Ephesians. 3. 16. and the hid man
of the heart, 1 Pet. 3. 4. Now as God esteems of every man's actions,
according to that heart and inward grace it proceeds from, so yet he
esteems men, not so much according to the measure and quantity of grace they
have, as according to the truth and soundness of grace, that he discerns in
them: and this is a comfortable point, if it be well considered. If a man have
any one grace in him in truth and soundnes (though it be but one, though that
one be exceeding small and weak, as that little spark in the smoking flax;
and, you know a very little spark will make flax to smoke, Mat. 12. 20.) he
may be sure he is the child of God. Mark therefore how often this is spoken of,
as the most infallible note of Gods child. Ioh. 1. 47. Behold indeed an
Israelite (says Christ of Nathaniel) in whom is no guile. Psalm. 32. 2. Blessed
is the man, to whom the Lord imputes not iniquity. (But how shall we know this
happy man, whose sins are forgiven? he adds) and in whose spirit there is
no guile. And Ver. 11. Be glad ye righteous, and rejoice in the Lord, (Yes, but
who is righteous? If none may rejoice but those that are righteous, what are we
the better? therefore he expounds himself in the next words) and be joyful all
ye that are upright in heart. Hear what a prayer the Prophet makes, Psalm.
125. 4. Do good unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in heart.
See the Lords answer to that prayer, Esa. 63. 8. He said, Surely they are my
people, children that will not lie. So I was their Savior. Mark what comfort
the poor servants of God have found in this, Remember now O Lord I be sees
thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, Esa.
38. 3.

Now on the other side, consider the dangerous and fearful condition of every
2.
hypocrite, of every man, who has a false and unsound heart; for let such a
one live never so ciuilly before men, yea, let him perform never so good
duties, and such as God commands: yet, 1. He does but lose his labor; God
accepts nothing that he does: as it is said of Amazia, 2 Chro. 25. 2. He did
that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not with a sound heart. 2.
His state shall be fearful in the life to come, as well as the state of the
vilest liver. Mat. 24. 51 God will cut him off, and give him his portion with
hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 3. When God does by
affliction awaken his conscience, and discover to him the unsoundness of his
heart, he has usually as little comfort, as hope in God, he is wont to be as
much overwhelmed with terrors and anguish of heart, as the most profane and
lewd man in the world. Job 27. 8. What hope has the hypocrite when he has
heaped up riches, if God take away his soul? and 36. 13, 14. Hypocrites in
heart increase the wrath: for they call not when he binds them; their soul
dies in youth, and their life among the whore-mongers.

The third and last Reason, that may move us to examine our hearts well, 3.
and try whether there be any truth and soundness in them, is, in
consideration of the great difficulty that there is in discerning the
uprightness of the heart: for, first, the heart of man is exceeding
deceitful, Ier. 17. 9. There is indeed an hypocrisy and falsnesse of heart,
which is not unknown; but all hypocrisy is not so gross: a man may be an
hypocrite, and have a false heart, and himself not know it. Secondly, a man
that has no grace at all, nothing but nature, may have many good things in
him: First, he may be free from many sins, as the Pharisee gloried he was,
Luke 18. 11. There was a kind of incest that was not heard of among the
Gentiles, 1 Cor. 5. 1. Yea, more free than the child of God. Abimelech would
never have desired Sarah, if he had known she had been another man's wife, Genesis
20. 5. Secondly, he may do many good things, The Gentiles which have not the
Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law, Romans 2. 14. and therein go
beyond many a child of God; he may show much justice in his dealings with men.
The Pharisee could say, Luke 18. 11. I give tithes of all that I possess: he
may give much to the poor, Mat. 6. 2. The hypocrite gave alms in Synagogues
and Streets, and had a trumpet blown before him, which he would never have
done, if his alms had not been large and bountiful: he may be a good
neighbor, and a kind and thankful man to his friend, Mat. 5. 46. the
Publicans were such; he may be apt enough to forgive an enemy, Ahab was even
too apt to do so, 1 Reg. 20. 32. Thirdly, yea, he may have great shows in him
of sanctification, he may feel in himself a check and remorse of conscience,
when he has done evil, by reason of the effect of the Law that is written in
his heart, his conscience will sometimes be ready to witness against him, and
his thoughts to accuse him, Romans 2. 15. He may have some care and conscience to
pray, as even the mariners had, Ion. 1. 5. Yea, to join fasting with prayer,
as the hypocrites profess they did, and glory in it, Esa. 58. 3. He may show
great love to Gods Word, and delight in it. Esa. 58. 2. They seek me early,
and will know my ways, even as a Nation that did righteously. Yea, he may do
this, not in show and pretense only, but unfeignedly: Mar. 6. 20. Herod heard
John gladly. Yea, the Word may cause him to leave many sins he lived in
before, and in many things to lead his life like a Christian. Mar. 6. 20. When
Herod heard John, he did many things. And 2 Pet. 2. 20. it is said of certain
hypocrites, That they had escaped from the filthiness of the world, through
the knowledge of the Lord, and of the Savior Jesus Christ. You see then, no
man may conclude thus, I have these and these good things in me; therefore I am
Gods child: but every man (if he be wise, and desire to provide for the sound
comfort of his soul) had need to search and examine diligently, whether these
things be the fruits of grace, and proceed from an upright and sanctified
heart, yea, or no. Satisfy not thy self with shows and shadows of
goodness. To this purpose belongs that exhortation of the Apostle, 1 Cor.
13. 5. Examine your selves, whether ye be in the Faith. Yea, we should pray to
God to help us in this work, as David did, Search me O God, and know my
heart, try me, and know my thoughts; and see if there be any wicked way in me,
and lead me in the way everlasting, Psalm. 139. 23, 24. Thirdly, there is much
evil and corruption in every regenerate man; the good things that are in him,
are as a little fire in such a heap of ashes, as a little corn in such a deal
of chafe, mixed and intermingled with corruption, that it is hard for them to
discern the work of grace in themselves, We all are as an unclean thing, and
all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags, Esa. 64. 6.

Lecture the hundred and one. September. 17. 1611. JOHN IIII. L.
IT remains, that we now proceed to that which the last day the time would
not permit me to speak of: namely, to show how, and by what notes a man may
certainly discern the uprightness of his own heart, and put a true
difference between grace and nature, between the good things that are proper
to the regenerate, and those good things that may be found in the hypocrite and
carnal man. For to exhort you (as I have done) carefully to examine, whether
there be truth of grace in your inward affections, may do you much more hurt
than good, unless I shall also direct you, how that may be done, how you may
come to know that. For our encouragement then (to make entrance into so
profitable and necessary a matter) we must first understand this, that though
it be difficult and hard, yet it is not impossible for a man that has grace,
to know assuredly that he has it, to be undoubtedly persuaded of the truth and
soundness of his own heart. It is true indeed, that it is a far more easy
thing for a regenerate man, to discern that corruption that is in him, than
that grace that is in him. When the Apostle speaks of the fruits of the flesh,
Gal. 5. 19. he says of them, That the works of the flesh are manifest: But
when he comes to speak of the fruits of the Spirit, he says not so of them,
Uerse 22. The grace of Gods Spirit is a hidden and secret thing; and is called
(therefore) the hidden man of the heart, 1 Peter 3. 4. and will not certainly
be discerned, unless a man take great heed to observe and mark it well, to
try and examine it. It is said of the good Merchant, that when he had found
the hidden treasure (before he could be so certain, that it was the true
treasure, as to be willing to sell all that ever he had to buy it) he was feign
to withdraw himself (as Merchants use to do, that have great accounts to
make) that he might try whether it was the true treasure or no, Matthew 13.
44. Yet is this also certain, that a regenerate man, that will take the pains
to examine his own heart, may be undoubtedly assured, that he has grace; that
he has more in him, than ever natural man or hypocrite could attain unto:
else had the Apostles exhortation been in vain, that we should Use diligence to
make our calling and election sure, 2 Peter 1. 10. if it were not possible for
a man to be certain and assured, that he is effectually called. Paul was
assured, that he had a good conscience in all things, and was willing to live
honestly, Hebr. 13. 18. and Peter knew well (even then when he was so humbled
for his fearful fault) that he did unfeignedly love Christ above all, John 21.
17. And Hezekiah, in the time of his great affliction, knew assuredly (and was
able to call God for a witness to his conscience in it) that he had walked
before God in truth, and with a perfect heart, Esaias 38. 3. And the Apostle
(speaking in the person, not of himself only, or some rare and extraordinary
persons, but) of all the regenerate, says, John 5. 19. We know that we are of
God; that is, borne of God: as is plain by the former Verse. This then being
so, that a regenerate man may certainly know he has soundness of grace in
him; let us consider how, and by what notes we may know it. And because if a
man have any one grace in him in truth and soundness, he may be certain, that
his heart is upright, and that he is truly regenerate; I will therefore insist
only upon four graces, by which we may make trial of the soundness of our
own hearts sufficiently; and those four are these: 1. Knowledge. 2.
Repentance, and forsaking of sin. 3. Obedience, and practice of good duties.
4. Faith, and confidence in the mercy of God.

First then, every regenerate man has a sanctified knowledge and understanding
Knowledge.
of the will of God revealed in his Word; and the man that has any measure of
sanctified knowledge, doubtless, has a good heart. This is the first work of
grace, and the foundation of all the rest. The new man is renewed in knowledge,
says the Apostle, Col. 3. 10. without that there is no vprightnes nor grace in
the heart. When the Wiseman had said, Pro. 19. 1. Better is the poor man that
walks in his uprightness, than the fool that abuses his lips: he adds, Ver.
2. For without knowledge the mind is not good, or is destitute of goodness. And
this is said to be the first and chief work of the ministry of the Word, to
open the eyes of men, and to bring them from darkness unto light, from the power
of Satan unto God: till mine eyes be opened, and they be turned from darkness
to light, they remain still under the power of Satan, Acts 26. 18. and Psalm.
36. 10. Extend thy loving kindness to them that know thee, and thy
righteousness to them that are upright in heart. He that says he has a good
heart toward God, and has no knowledge, cares not for it; or he that praises
such and such men for good men, that have no knowledge of the Word; is a liar,
and the truth is not in him.

Quest. But may a man conclude thus, I have knowledge; therefore I have grace,
and an upright heart?

Answ. No; for, many a natural man and hypocrite have attained to a great
measure of knowledge: the Apostle says of the hypocritical Jews, Romans 2. 18.
Thou know his will and allowest the things that are excellent, in that thou
art instructed by the Law. And v. 20. Which have the form of knowledge, and of
the truth in the Law. As if he should say, thou art exercised in, and
acquainted with the whole body of Religion set down in the Law. And He. 6. 4.
of such hypocrites as may fall into the impardonable sin, he says, They may be
enlightened. But the knowledge of the natural man, and of the regenerate, do
differ in these points:

First, the man that has saving knowledge, is willing and desirous to know the
whole will of God revealed in his Word; as Act. 10. 33. We are present here
before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God: yet chiefly
those things that are most necessary and profitable, and that do most concern
his own practice, he is most desirous to hear and learn. As it is noted as a
special fruit of grace in the poor Publicans and Soldiers, that came to
hear John; every one desired to hear what they should do, Luke 3. 10, 12, 14.
Yea, he is willing to hear that part of the Word, that makes most against him:
he likes that Preacher best, that (with most plainness and power) discovers
and rebukes his sins, so he do it by the Word of the Lord. As it is said of
Eli, that (though he saw just cause to think, that the message Samuel had to
deliver, was much against him, yet) he charge him, 1 Samuel 3. 17. God do so to
thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me, of all that the Lord has
said unto thee. On the contrary side, the natural man (though he may busy
himself in seeking the knowledge of some points that minister questions rather
than godly edifying which is in says, as the Apostle speaks, 1 Timothy 1. 4.)
is unwilling and afraid to know some parts of Gods truth; such as he has
conceived a prejudice against, such as touch himself in particular: at such he
winks with his eyes, as our Savior says, Mat. 13. 15. Esa. 30. 10. He says
unto the Seer, See not, (such truths as these, though they offer themselves
never so clearly in thy Text) and to the Prophets, Prophecy not unto us right
things. I may not stand to apply every particular note unto you, do it your
selves: if ye desire to know the vprightnes of your own hearts, examine your
knowledge by this first note.

Secondly, the regenerate man seeks the knowledge of God with no other intent,
but that he may practice that he knows, and direct his life by it. Psalm. 119.
34. Give me understanding, and I will keep thy Law: yea, I will keep it with
my whole heart. 1 Peter 2. 2. As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of
the Word, that ye may grow thereby. On the other side, the natural man seeks
knowledge, only for knowledge and speculation sake, or that he may maintain
talk with it, as occasion shall serve. Ezekiel. 33. 31. My people sit before thee,
and hear thy words, but they will not do them.

Thirdly, the regenerate man is apt to approve of Gods truth, when it is
revealed unto him, and to believe and receive it. Indeed he may be ignorant of
many truths, and may oppose them for a time, even when the means are used to
reveal them unto him: but he is able to discern the truth from erour, when
both are laid before him, how soever he did not see it before. Ioh. 10. 4, 5.
The sheep follow him, for they know his voice, and they will not follow a
stranger: but they fly from him, for they know not the voice of a stranger.
And of the Noble Bereans it is said, Acts 17 11. That they received the word
with all readiness. And in this respect the Apostle says, that the Lords
intent in suffering heresies to spring up in his Church, was, That they that
were approved among them, and had sound hearts, might be known, 1 Cor. 11. 19.
Therefore the Apostle speaks so fearfully of the Jews for not receiving the
truth when it was clearly manifested unto them, Hearing ye shall hear, and
shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive; for the heart
of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their
eyes have they closed, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with
their ears, and understand with their hearts, and I should heal them, Acts
28. 26, 27. On the other side, the natural man, though he have much knowledge
and excellent gifts, yet is he of a corrupt mind, and unsound judgment in some
clear and manifest truths or other, full of reasoning, and oppositions against
it, (1 Timothy 6. 5.) If any consent not to the wholesome words of the Lord Jesus
Christ, and uses vain disputations, he knows nothing, (says the Apostle)
his mind is corrupt, and destitute of truth.

Fourthly, the knowledge of a regenerate man may be discerned by this, It has
power to reform and rule his heart, and works in him a care of practice and
obedience. Luke 8. 15. They that with an honest and good heart bear the word,
keep it, and bring forth fruits with patience. 1 John 2. 3, 4. Hereby we are
sure we know him, if we keep his commandments: he that says, I know him, and
keeps not his commandments, is a liar. Esa. 2. 3. He shall teach us his
ways, and we will walk in his paths. Yea, sanctified knowledge makes a man
strong, to resist and stand against tentation, The fear of the Lord, that is
wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding, Job 28, 28. Prou. 24. 5. A
wise man is strong; for a man of understanding increases his strength: He that
can say, as Psalm. 17. 4. By the word of thy lips, I have kept me from the path
of the destroyer, is a happy man, he knows the truth with a saving knowledge.
On the contrary side, the natural man's knowledge swimmeth in his brain, and
has no power in his heart. It is said of the sons of Eli, They were wicked
men, and knew not the Lord, 1 Samuel 2. 12. They had no jot of sanctified
knowledge in them.

Fifthly and lastly, the regenerate man, though he find himself wanting
sometimes in these properties of sanctified knowledge, yet feels he this
ignorance, and bewailes it; and what measure of knowledge soever he has
attained to, he satisfies not himself in it, but the more he knows, the more
he desires to increase in knowledge. This you shall see in David, Open thou
mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law; teach me thy
statutes, make me to understand the way of thy precepts, Psalm 119. 18, 26,
27. On the other side, the natural man is well persuaded of his own
knowledge, thinks he knows enough, and is full, Woe be to you that are full,
Luke 6. 25.

The second grace, wherein I told you, we were to make trial of the Repentance.
soundness of our hearts, is Repentance; by which I mean (in this place) only
the forsaking of sin. Now there is no one grace in soundness and
uprightness in that man's heart, that has not unfeignedly repented and forsaken
his sins. Acts 11. 18. Then has God also to the Gentiles granted repentance
unto life. Unless we can be able to say, These and these sins I know I have
left, surely, we have not repented: We were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
deceived, serving diverse lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy,
hateful and hating one another, Tit. 3. 3. And the man that has unfeignedly
repented and forsaken his sins, doubtless, has an upright heart. Thus says
David of himself, Psalm. 18. 23. I was upright before him, and kept my self
from mine iniquity: for he that has repented, is justified and has his sins
forgiven him. Act. 5. 31. Christ is called a Prince and Savior, to give
repentance and forgiveness of sins. If yan man shall ask, May not some natural
men forsake, and leave the sins they have lived in? I answer, Yes; Peter
speaks of some temporaries and hypocrites, that had escaped the filthiness of
the world, 2. Pet. 2. 20. and our Savior of one that had the unclean spirit
cast out of him, and his house swept and garnished, Matthew. 12. 44.

But these differences there be, betwixt the repentance of the regenerate and
natural man.

1. The regenerate man forsakes sin of conscience to God, even because he
knows God has forbidden it, is offended and dishonored by it, as his sorrow
for sin is according to God, 2. Cor. 79. so is his forsaking of sin also, 2.
Cor. 7. 10. Yea, his forsaking of his sin grows (though not only, yet) chiefly
from the knowledge he has of Gods mercy, and from the love he bears to God
for his goodness, he forsakes his evil way, and returns to the Lord out of
this hope and persuasion that he will have mercy upon him, and that our God
will abundantly pardon, Esaias 55. 7. He fears the Lord and his goodness, Hos.
3. 5. The grace of God that brings salvation (the Gospel which makes known
to us Gods love in Christ) has taught him to deny ungodliness and worldly
lusts, Tit. 2. 11, 12. On the other side, the hypocrite forsakes his sins or
rather seems so to do, first, for that he wants means to follow them, as of
old: or, secondly, no occasion is offered to show his corruption in: thirdly,
or out of respect he has to his credit with men: fourthly, or out of the
apprehension of Gods wrath only.

2. The regenerate man forsakes not one or two, but all known sins. Why then
there is no man regenerate (will you say) For in many things we sin all,
James 2. 3. But my meaning is, though he cannot shake off every sin, yet there
is no known sin, that willingly he gives liberty to himself in, be it small
or great, when once it is discovered to him to be a sin, he makes a conscience
of it, as Daniel did of defiling himself with the Kings meat, Dan. 1. 8. he
kept Gods law (and his conscience to obey it) as the apple of his eye, which
the least more will offend, Pro. 7. 2. This is called preciseness, and foolish
niceness. I grant, that it is indeed a note of an hypocrite, to be precise and
strict in small matters, and make no conscience of gross sins, to tithe mi^t
and cummin, and to neglect the weightyer points of the law, to streine at a
gnat and to swallow a cammell, Mat. 23. 23, 24. yet he that shall say of the
least sin, Tush, that is nothing; If I never do worse, I shall do well enough:
doubtless, that man has no soundnes in his heart. James 2. 10, 11. Whosoever
shall keep the whole Law, yet fail in one point, is guilty of all. For he
that said, Thou shall not commit adultery, said also, Thou shall not kill. The
least sin committed wilfully and presumptuously, becomes dangerous and
damnable, the soul that does ought presumptuously, shall be cut off from among
his people; as the man was by Gods express commandment that had (in that
sort) but gathered a few sticks upon the Sabbath day, Number. 15. 30. 32. On the
other side, no natural man or hypocrite ever made conscience of all sin, but
either he has some one sin, that is, his beloved sin, which he will not part
with, as Herod had, Mar. 6. 20. or of many sins, which he counts small, he
makes no conscience at all, but even despises his ways in them, as Solomon
speaks, Pro. 19. 16.

3. The regenerate man, though he slip often, yet the unfeigned desire and
purpose of his heart, is to forsake all his sins. This is a sure note of grace,
in this Paul comfort himself that he allowed not himself in any evil that
he did, but hated it, that to will was present with him, To. 7. 15. 18. And
Nehemia in this that he was one of these that did desire to fear Gods name,
Neh. 1. 11. And David in this, that the full purpose of his heart was that he
would not offend no not so much as in word, Psalm. 17. 3. And the vnfainednesse
of his desire may be discerned, first, by his willingness to be admonished,
and to have his sins discovered to him, he can say with David, Let the
righteous smite, yea let him reprove me, Psalm. 141. 3. yea he can heartily pray
unto God with Job, make me to know my transgression and my sin, Job 13. 23.
Secondly, by his careful shunning of all means, that might draw him to sin,
as Joseph did, he shunned the company of his lewd mistrisse and would not be
with her alone, Genesis 39. 10. Thirdly, by his earnest praying to God, for
strength against his sins, as David did, cleanse thou me from secret faults;
keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins, let them not have dominion
over me, Psalm. 19. 12, 13. Order my steps in thy word, and let not any iniquity
have dominion over me, Psalm. 119. 133. Fourthly, by the continual fear of his
heart, lest he should at any time do that that might offend God, happy is the
man that fears always, Pro. 28. 14. Fifthly, by the ability and strength he
has given him of God, not only to will, but to do also in some measure,
actually and indeed to forsake his sin, for God has not given us the spirit of
fear, but of power, and love and of a sound mind, 2. Tim. 1. 7. Though he may
often fall through frailty, yet ordinarily, and for the most part, grace
preuailes above his corruption; he cannot walk after the flesh, Romans 8. 1. He
cannot continue in sin, the power of sin is daily weakened in him. Now such a
desire and purpose to forsake sin, was never yet found in an hypocrite or
natural man.

Lecture the hundred and two. September 24. 1611. JOHN IIII. L.
IT remains now, that we come to examine the two latter of these four
graces, which I told you, I would instance in for the trial of the truth, and
uprightness of our hearts. If any man shall mislike, that I stand so long upon
this matter, and think it needless, to bring so many notes to try the truth,
and uprightness of the heart by (seeing, as I have told you already, if a man
have any one grace in him in truth, he may be certain of his regeneration) I
will make answer unto him, as the Apostle does in another case, Phil. 3. 1. It
grieueth me not, and for you it is a sure or safe thing. Though it were far
more ease for me to pass over this matter, and to proceed to such other things
as follow in my Text, yet being entered into so profitable an argument (not
without the good guidance of Gods spirit, as I am well assured) it grieueth me
not to stand thus long upon it, to give so many notes of true regeneration. And
for you that hear me, this is a sure and safe course; for this will tend
greatly, first, to the comfort of so many of you as are regenerate. He that
cannot find every one of these notes in himself (as it falls out often with
many a good child of God) yet among so many, he may be sure to find some; and
(though from some one note a man may infallibly conclude, he is in the state of
grace, yet) the more of these notes any man shall, be able to find in
himself, the more certain assurance, and strong consolation shall he have.
And secondly, to the humbling of every one of you that is yet unregenerate, and
causing you to seek betimes for to better your estate, when (among so many
notes of true grace) you shall not be able to find in your selves any one,
when you shall have so many evidences to convince your conscience, that you are
yet in your sins, and the wrath of God abides upon you; Let us therefore come
to the third grace, wherein this trial is to be made.

Every regenerate man is in some measure made able to obey the commandments 3.
Obedie^se
of God, and to practice the good duties he requires of him: and there is no
one grace in soundness and uprightness in that heart, that is not obedient
unto God. This is plain, 1. John 3. 10 Whosoever does not righteousness, is not
of God. 1. King. 8. 6. let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord your
God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments. As if he should
say, Therein stands the perfection, and uprightness of the heart, thereby it
may be known. So does Hezekia demonstrate the vprightnes of his heart, Is. 3.
38 I beseech thee Lord, remember how I have walked before thee in truth and
with a perfect heart, and have done that which was good in thy sight. And on
the other side, he that can in any measure yield true obedience unto God, or
perform any one duty well, is certainly a regenerate man. For every natural
man is a child of disobedience, Ephesians. 2. 2. he is to every good work
reprobate, Tit. 1. 16. neither can he perform a right any one good duty, that
God requires. Romans 3. 12. They are made altogether unprofitable, there is none
that does g^ood, no not one. Mark this well, and examine thine own heart by
it, if thou have any one fruit of the spirit, if thou can do any good work,
perform any one duty well; I say not, if thou can pray well, but if thou
can do but the least, and lowest of all good duties well, thou may be
certain, that thou art more than a natural man, that thou art in the state of
grace: this is plain, as the branch cannot bear fruit of it self unless it
abide in the vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me; without me ye can
do nothing, John 15. 4, 5. See therefore what assurance the Scripture says
may be grounded upon our obedience unto God, even in some one duty: if a man
can but love the brethren, 1. John 3. 14. if he be but poor in spirit, Matthew.
5. 3. if he can but mourn a right, Matthew. 5. 4. if he can but hunger and
thirst after righteousness a right, Matthew. 5. 6. he is a blessed man. True it
is, that it is not possible one should have one grace alone, as he whom Christ
has once washed with his blood is clean every whit, John 13. 10. so the grace
of regeneration is like leaven that leaueneth the whole lump, Matthew. 13. 33. it
goes thorough the whole man: but diverse of the faithful are often in that case,
that they can feel some one good thing in themselves, when they can discern
no more. In which case, this Doctrine is very comfortable and useful unto them.

Object. This Doctrine I like well (will many a one say that hates Religion
with all his heart) I thank God, I have been able to do some good; yea, more
than many of your professors: and therefore, I know I have more grace, and a
better heart than they. Yea, we know, how the Papists boast against our
Religion, and all that profess it: We are more devout, and zealous in prayer
(say they) we are much more abundant in fasting, almsdeeds, and other good
works, than you: and therefore also we have more grace than you.

Answ. But to these I answer: First, all this may be very true (and would to
God it were not too true, of many that profess the truth.) But know you, many
hypocrites and natural men have been able to do such works, as outwardly, and
in appearance, have been very good (as I showed you in sundry particulars the
last day, but one.) Yea, they have been able herein to compare with, and even
to excel many a good Christian. Esau seemed outwardly, to seek the blessing
with far more devotion and zeal than Jacob; he cried much louder, and shed
many more tears for it, than Jacob did, Genesis 27. 34. 38. And Ahab in outward
show, was much more humbled for his sin, than Hezekia was, 1. King. 21. 27. He
rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon him, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth:
and you shall find none of all this in the repentance of Hezekiah, Esaias 38. 2,
3. And the Pharisee could say (and I doubt not, but he said truly) that he both
fasted more, and was outwardly a far iuster man in his dealings with men,
than the Publican was, Luke 18. 12. But none of all these works were good in
Gods sight; neither can any natural man do any good work, that is good in
Gods sight; their best works are but beautiful sins: though they be often
highly esteemed among men, they are abomination in the sight of God, Luke 16.
15. I will therefore show you out of Gods Word sundry manifest differences,
between the good works of the regenerate, and of the natural man. And these
differences we will observe: First, in the matter of their works, the things
wherein they show their obedience unto God. Secondly, in the manner how these
good works are done, and performed by them. In the matter of their works, I
will observe unto you three notable differences:

The regenerate man makes conscience only of such works, counts 1.
them only good works, as God has in his Word commanded, such only as may
be called, John 6. 28. the works of God, and not of men. To count nothing a
good work but only that which God has ordained for us to walk in, as the
Apostle speaks, Ephesians. 2. 10. To make no conscience of any thing, but only of
that that God has prescribed in his Word, is a singular note of an upright
heart. This we shall find, Psalm 119. 1. Blessed are those that are upright
in their way, and walk in the law of the Lord. As if he should say, So shall
you know them that are upright in their way. Thus Job comfort himself, and
proves the uprightness of his own heart, Job 23. 10. But he knows my way,
and tries me, and I shall come forth like the Gold; how proves he that? verse
11. My foot has followed his steps, his way have I kept. On the other side,
this is made the note of an hypocrite, to put holiness in, or make conscience
of such things as God never commanded. Mar. 7. 6, 7. Christ calls them
hypocrites that made conscience of the Jewish purifyings (though that were an
old, and general custom) because it was but a commandment of men, a
tradition of men. This proves all Papists to be Hypocrites; many of their
chief good works that they put most holiness in, are such as God never
commanded. Nay there is no natural man under heaven that makes this reckoning
of the word, or that does thus cleave unto it. First, he makes the custom, and
example, and commandment of men the chief rule of his conscience. Secondly,
he does in many things that that is good in his own eyes. Let us therefore
tric our obedience by this first note.

The second note of difference is this, The regenerate man makes conscience 2.
of every duty God has in his Word commanded: every commandment has a divine
authority in his heart, him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he
shall say unto you, Acts 3. 22. This is noted of Zachary and Elizabeth, Luke 1.
6. That they walked in all the commandments, and ordinances of the Lord
blameless. Gods child is willing to be directed by his Word in all things;
even in the least, not in matters of godliness only and in our duties toward
God, and of righteousness in all our duties toward men, but even in matters
of sobriety also and in the moderating of our selves in the use of all such
things as are neither expressly commanded nor forbidden by God, Tit. 2. 12. This
we shall also find, is made an infallible mark of an upright heart. Observe
this in David's prayer, 1. Chron. 29. 19. Give to Solomon my son a perfect
heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do
all things. Neither our meat, nor recreations, nor the labors and affairs of
our calling, are sanctified unto us, unless we use them according to the word,
1. Tim. 4. 5. And we find what conscience our Savior made, even of a matter
of circumstance in the Ceremonial Law; namely, touching the just time when the
Passover was to be celebrated. True it is, that a regenerate man may (and does
often) fail in many duties God requires; but he makes conscience of every
duty; the unfeigned desire, and endeavor of his heart, is to keep every
commandment of God, to obey God in one thing as well as in another. This was
David's comfort and assurance, Psalm 119. 6. Then shall I not be confounded,
when I have respect unto all thy commandments. John 15. 14. Ye are my friends
if ye do whatsoever I command you. Now there was never any hypocrite or
natural man, that was able to go thus far; but either he seems to make
conscience of the second Table, and neglects the first; or he seems very
devout in the duties of the first, and is unconscionable in the second: many
commandments in the Word have no authority at all in his heart. I might
instance against many of you, in that one mentioned, above all things my
brethren swear not, James 5. 12. and against many others of you in other
commandments of God. Thus was the hypocrisy of Iehu and Herod descried,
though both of them went very far. If we look into Iehu's story, we shall
see cause to think, that surely, he was a good man: For, first, he was
immediately chosen by God to be King, 2. Kings 9. 3. secondly, so soon as he
was called, he showed strange diligence and zeal, in executing on Ahabs house
and friends, the commandment he had received, 2. Kings 9. 7. compared with
verse 14 -- 18. 24. 33. 2. Kings 10. 6. 11. 14. 17. thirdly, he destroyed Baals
Priests, and Images, and purged the land of that Idolatry, 2. Kings 10. 21 --
28. fourthly, he did all this in a zeal for God, 2. Kings 10. 16. in so much,
as the Lord himself commended him for it, 2. Kings 10. 30. fifthly, he bore a
notable hatred to the foul sins of Iezabel, 2. King. 9. 22. sixthly, he bore
a reverend regard to Gods Word, which he showed by remembering it so long, and
acknowledging the certainety and righteousness of it, and his care to see it
performed, and by doing that he did, by direction of it, and in obedience unto
it, 2. King. 9. 25, ^6. 36, 37. and persuading others to acknowledge the
certainty and righteousness of it, 2. King. 10. 10. seventhly, he had a
reverend respect to good men, 2. King. 9. 36. and 10. 10. he mentions not
Eliah's name without title of reverence, he shows great respect to Iehonadab,
2. Kings 10. 15, 16. yet this man was no better than an hypocrite, his heart
was not sound, Iehu took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord God of Israel
with all his heart, 2. King. 10. 31. and therefore God esteemed no better of
all that he did, than of murder, I will avenge the blood of Iezreel upon the
house of Iehu, Hos. 1. 4. And the principal (if not the only) thing, whereby
his hypocrisy was discovered, was this; He did not in all points follow the
direction of Gods Law, nor make conscience of it: though he hated some Idolatry
(as that of Baal) yet he hated not all Idolatry, he departed not from the
Idolatry of Jeroboam, 2. Kings 10. 29. 31. So Herod went very far, Mar. 6. 20.
but in this his hypocrisy was discovered; he could not make conscience of all
that John taught him, nor forsake all his known sins.

The third note of difference is this, The regenerate man, though he make 3.
conscience of every duty God has enjoined him, yet makes he most conscience
of, and is most careful to observe the greatest commandments, and such duties
as God has most straightly enjoined. This note we shall find given by our
Savior, Matthew. 23. 24. he makes it a property of hypocrites to strain at a
Gnat, and swallow a Camel; this is often noted for a property of the hypocrite.
The Pharisees were exceeding precise for the external rest of the Sabbath,
even more than any Law of God required them to be, Luke 13. 14, 15. They tithed
Mint, and Annise, and Cummin, but they neglected the waightiest matters of the
Law, Matthew. 23. 23.

If you ask me, which be those waightier matters of the Law; I answer, They be
chiefly of three kinds: first, the inward worship of God, thou shall shall love
the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
mind, this is the first and great commandment, Matt. 22. 37, 38. secondly,
judgment, mercy, and fidelity toward men, Matthew. 23. 23. thirdly, the duties
of our particular and special callings: this may appear, Esaias 1. 17. Learn
to do well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless,
plead for the widow. Who must do this? Verse 10. Ye rulers of Sodom, ye
people of Gomorrah. And by the Apostles often beating upon this point, in all
their Epistles; the duties of Masters, Servants, Husbands, Wives, Parents,
Children, Subjects, Pastor, Flock: and by that conclusion, Paul makes to this
Doctrine, Tit. 2. 15. These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all
authority. On the contrary side, the hypocrite is more careful, and busy
about other men's duties, and the reformation of other men's faults, than his
own, he can see the least mote in his brothers eye, but cannot discern a beam
in his own, he seems very careful to reform the least fault he sees in
another, but has no care of reforming himself, Matthew. 7. 3 -- 5. He binds
heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lays them on other men's shoulders,
but himself will not move them with one of his fingers, Matthew. 23. 4. Herein
then, I pray you, make trial of your selves, if you desire to know the
soundness of your own hearts.

Lecture the hundred and three. October 1. 1611. JOHN IIII. L.
IT follows, that we come now to show you the difference, betwixt the good
works of the regenerate and natural man, in the manner of their doing, and
performing of them.

And indeed, this is a principal thing we must have respect unto, if we desire
to know, whether the good duties we do, proceed from true grace, yea, or no.
See this in that direction the Apostle gives, he that gives, let him do it
with simplicity, he that rules with diligence, he that shows mercy with
cheerfulness, Romans 12. 8. For the Lord has often noted the false and
counterfeit obedience of the hypocrite, by this property, that (though he have
done such works, as for the matter of them have been right and good, yet) he
has never done them in a right manner, not with a right affection: as it is
said of Amazia, 2. Chron. 25. 2. He did uprightly in the eyes of the Lord, but
not with a perfect heart. And on the other side, it is noted for a property of
true and saving obedience, when there is care, not only to do the thing God
commands, but to do it also in that manner, and with that affection of
heart, that God has commanded: as we shall see in the example of the children
of Israel, Exodus 39. 42, 43. According to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so
the children of Israel made all the work. And Moses looked upon all the work,
and behold, they had done it as the Lord had commanded. And in the speech and
example of our Savior, John. 14. 31. That the world may know, that I love the
Father, as the Father has commanded me so I do: not only what the Father
has commanded, that I do; but I do as he has commanded. I find therefore in
Gods Word four evident notes of difference between the good duties that are
performed by the natural man, and by him that has a sound and sanctified
heart, even in the manner of doing of them.

The regenerate man intends, and the end he aims at in doing good duties, is
to please, and honor God; he has a single and sincere respect to God, Note 1.
and nothing else: he does that which he does, because he knows God has
commanded it; he is pleased with, he is honored by that which he does. The
notice he knows God will take of it, his allowance, and reward, contents him,
and he seek no more. The regenerate man serves God, even in those duties he
performs to men, even in the duties of his calling. Romans 12. 11. Not
sloathfull to do service (he means one to another, as is plain, verse 10.)
fervent in spirit serving the Lord. And exhorting Servants to their duties to
Infidel Masters, he says, Colos. 3. 24. Ye serve the Lord Christ. True it
is, an intent and desire to please God in that we do, is not sufficient to
argue a sound and sanctified heart, unless it be guided by knowledge: the
wretched Jews (even in contradicting and persecuting Christ and his Gospel)
had the zeal of God, Romans 10. 2. and without knowledge the mind, and intent
of a man's heart cannot be good, Pro. 19. 2. But yet this is a singular and
certain note of an upright heart, when in doing the duties which he knows God
in his Word has commanded, the intent of his heart is only to please and
honor God thereby, and nothing else. This is made the touchstone to try the
sincerity and uprightness of the Magistrates heart by, Psalm. 101. 1. I will
sing mercy and judgment, to thee O Lord will I sing. As if he should say, That
shall be the mark that I will aim at in all that I do both in my works of
mercy, and of justice also. So Christ makes this the touchstone to try the
uprightness of the Ministers heart by, John 7. 18. He that seeks his glory
that sent him, the same is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him. So
Paul, laboring to restrain the faithful from condemning their brethren that
differed from them in practice about indifferent things, gives this reason:
Judge them not, for they do that they do with an upright heart. How proves he
that? Why (says he, Romans 14. 6.) he that observes the day, observes it to
the Lord, and he that observes not the day, observes it not to the Lord. He
that eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks, and he that eats
not, eats not to the Lord, and gives God thanks. Why but (may some say) how
could he that observed the day, and abstained from eating, do it to the Lord,
viz. to please and obey the Lord: when the Lord, now (since the death of
Christ) required no such thing of him? I answer, he knew God had in his law
required him to do so, and he knew not that God had abrogated that law; This
ignorance God passed by, and had respect to this uprightness of his heart
notwithstanding it. In this respect, of all works, those will yield a man
greatest comfort and assurance of the uprightness of his heart, wherein there
is least danger of having any other respect but only to the Lord: as first, of
all liberality that which is showed to the poor, Eccles. 11. 1. Cast thy bread
upon the waters: for thou shall find it after many days. Luke 14. 13, 14.
When thou make a feast call the poor, maimed, lame, blind, and thou shall
be blessed, because they cannot recompense thee, for thou shall be recompensed
at the resurrection of the just. So secondly, of all love and kindness, that
is the surest sign of grace which we show to our enemies, and to such
Christians as are poor, and in whom we see sundry infirmities, Matthew. 5. 44,
45. I say unto you love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to
them that hate you, and pray for them that hurt you, and persecute you; that
you may be (that is, may be known to be) the children of your father which is
in heaven: and Mat. 10. 42. Whosoever shall give to one of these little ones to
drink a cup of cold water only in the name of a Disciple; verily I say unto
you he shall not lose his reward. So thirdly, of all duties of piety,
domestical duties will yield a man more assurance of his sincerity, than
public. Psalm. 101. 2. I will walk in my house with a perfect heart: and
secret more than domestical, Matthew. 6. 6. But when thou prayest, enter into
thy chamber, and when thou have shut thy door, pray unto thy father which
sees in secret, and thy father that sees in secret shall reward thee openly,
Zac. 12. 12, 13. The land shall bewail every family apart; the family of the
house of David, Nathan, Leui, Shimei apart, and their wives apart. O that the
time would permit me to stand upon the application of this point; but I cannot
do it, you must do it your selves. By this note try thine own heart, in all
the duties thou performest to men, in all the duties of thy calling, but
specially in the duties of Gods service, ask thine own heart that question
which Christ asked Andrew, and his fellow when they first followed him, John 1.
38. What seek ye? Do thou that which thou do in obedience to him? is the
intent and purpose of thy heart to please and honor him? Surely the least duty
thou do so, will yield thee both comfort and reward also. Col. 3. 24. knowing
that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of inheritance ((...)) for ye
serve the Lord Christ. A man may do the thing God would have him do, and yet
be plagued for it, because he does not serve the Lord in it. Baasha is
threatened for killing Jeroboam, 1. Kings 16. 7. and yet it is said, 1. Kings
14. 14. the Lord stirred him up to do it; he did execute and fulfill the Lords
will. And certainly so shall it be with many a Preacher and hearer, they do the
duties God would have them do, but they serve not God in them. No natural man
can serve God in any good thing he does; his eye is not directed toward the
Lord, but he looks asquint, and has by-respects to his credit, or profit, or
pleasure, or merit: he seeks himself in every thing he does, even in the most
religious duties. Thus God charge the hypocrites, Zach. 7. 5. When ye
fasted, and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years,
did ye fast unto me, even unto me? He repeates this: as if he should say, This
was that that was wanting in your Fasts.

Yea, but (you will say) cannot a man have any soundness of grace in his
heart, unless he have this sincere and single respect to God in every thing
that he does? This is a hard saying, will many a poor Christian think.

I answer, that the best cannot wholly free himself from self-love, and
overmuch respect to himself, not only in the duties of his calling, but even
in Gods worship. Yet this he has; First, though in sundry particular actions
he fail, yet ordinarily, and in the course of his life, he has this respect
to God: and this is a blessed sign of grace, when our walking and our course
of life and conversation is not after the flesh, but after the spirit, Romans 8.
1. Secondly, in his mind he consents to this, that he should thus do, and his
conscience checks him, if he do it not: and even in this Paul himself found
great comfort, that in his mind he served the law of God, Romans 7. 25. Thirdly,
the desire and endeavor of his heart, is thus to respect the Lord in every
thing; he grieves, and strives against his corruption: and this with God is
accepted for the deed, if there be first a willing mind it is accepted, 2.
Cor. 8. 12.

Lecture the hundred and fourth. October 8. 1611. JOHN IIII. L.
LEt us now come to the second note of difference, that is to be observed in
the manner of doing good duties.

The regenerate man performs the good duties he does with his heart. This we
shall find made a property of true obedience, and the note of a sound
conversion. Romans 6. 17. God be thanked, that ye have been the servants of
sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart the form of Doctrine, whereinto ye
have been delivered. He is the same inwardly, and in his heart, which he
makes show of; yea, he has more goodness within him, than he can make show
of, out of the good treasure of his heart he brings forth good things, Matthew.
12. 35. For the chief and most proper seat of grace is the heart; and
therefore the regenerate part is called the inner man, Romans 7. 22. In his
dealings with men, a man may know the soundness of his regeneration, by this
note, Psalm 15. 2. He walks uprightly and works righteousness, and
speaks the truth from his heart. Colos. 3. 23. Whatsoever ye do, do it from
the heart, as to the Lord, and not to men: as if he should say, Else ye serve
not God in any thing ye do. So in the works of mercy, Esaias 58. 18. If thou
draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall
thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noone day. But
specially, in the duties of Gods worship, a man may know the soundness of his
regeneration, by this note, when he has a care to do that which he does from
the heart: he makes outward profession of good things, but his chief care is
to be religious within. He makes conscience also of (...) thoughts, cleanse me
from my secret faults, Psalm 19. 14. He is most troubled with his inward
corruptions, as Paul was, O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from
the body of this death? Romans 7. 24. Psalm. 84. 5. Blessed is the man, in whose
heart are thy ways. He knows well, that if the heart be reformed, it will be
easy to reform the words and works. Matthew 23. 26. Thou blind Pharisee,
cleanse first the inside of the cup and platter, that the outside of them may
be clean also. Mal. 2. 16. Keep your selves in your spirit, and transgress
not. So also in the particular duties of Gods worship, it may give a man
assurance of his regeneration, when a man's care is to perform them with his
heart. Every one of us in preaching, must be able to say with Paul, Romans 1.
9. I serve God in my spirit, in the Gospel of his Son: And every one of you
in hearing, must feel that in you that Lidia did, Acts 16. 14. The Lord opened
her heart, that she attended to the things that Paul speak. And we all, when
we pray, must be able to pray as Paul speaks, Ephesians 6. 18. With all
manner of prayer, and supplication in the spirit. And when we sing Psalms,
We must make m^lody to the Lord in our hearts, Colossians 3. 16. As if he
should say, The Lord regards no melody but that. True it is, there is many a
regenerate man, that finds much want of this inward truth of heart, in the
profession and practice of Religion; and there is much hypocrisy in the heart
of the best man that lives. That which the Apostle speaks of Christ, 1. Peter
2. 22. Who did no sin, neither was there guile found in his mouth: is proper
to Christ, and could never truly be spoken of any mere man; Let God be true,
and every man a liar, Romans. 3. 4. But yet this every regenerate man shall
find in himself, and may comfort himself in it: First, that this is a matter
of grief and humbling to him, when at any time he has felt this hypocrisy in
himself, and has had his heart away in any outward service he has done unto
God. Secondly, that ordinarily his care and unfeigned desire has been, in
every duty he has done to God, to do it with his heart: and so could never
hypocrite nor natural man say. No hypocrite or natural man has his care, to
serve God with his heart, either, first, in duties to men; they do as the
Prophet speaks, with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak,
Psalm 12. 2. secondly, and in duties to God; they are as they are described,
thou art near in their mouth, but far from their reins, Jeremy 12. 2. they
draw near to God with their mouth, and with their lips they do honor him,
but have removed their hearts far from him, Esaias 29. 13.

The third note of difference is this, That the regenerate man performs the
duties that he does out of love to God; yea, out of such a Note 3.
love as grows from Faith, even from the assurance he has of Gods love to him
in Christ. True it is, he fears Gods judgments, pass the time of your
soiourning here with fear, 1. Pet. 1. 17. and he is partly moved unto
obedience, by the fear of Gods judgments, and ought so to be. Eccles. 12. 13.
Fear God, and keep his commandments. And we find by experience, that many a
good heart is subject even to this fear. Psalm. 119. 120. My flesh trembles
for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgments. Yea, the Lord sees it
very profitable and necessary for them, that they should thus be made
acquainted with his terrors: the flesh and unregenerate part, would hardly be
kept in any obedience without this curb, nor would be forward to any good
duties without this spur. 2. Corinthians 7. 1. Finish your sanctification in
the fear of God. Yet is this a sure note of difference between every
hypocrite or natural man, and him that is truly regenerate. The regenerate
man's obedience grows chiefly from a love to God: yea, from such a love as
grows from Faith. You shall see clear proof for both these branches.

Every regenerate man loves the Lord. This is often made the title of Gods
servants, they are called such as love him, Psalm 5. 11. Let them 1.
that love thy Name rejoice in thee: and 69. 32. The seed of his servants
shall inherit Zion, and they that love his Name shall dwell therein. And 119.
132. Look upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou use to do to them
that love thy Name. Romans 8. 28. All things work together for good to them that
love him. 1. Corinthians 2. 9. Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither has
it entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them
that love him. James 1. 12. When he is tried, he shall receive the Crown of
life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him: and 2. 5. Has not
God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom,
which he has promised to them that love him? Yea, the regenerate man loves
the Lord, even then when he corrects and wounds him; even then would he not
for any thing, do ought that might offend God: he desires above all things to
be reconciled to him, and to please him; he bewailes the loss of his favor.
So that even when he is in the greatest affliction of mind, he may be said to
be sick of love, Canticles 2. 5. his love to God is the chief cause of his
sorrow and anguish. And his love appears in this, he serves God willingly and
desirously; yea, his will and desire is above his ability, 2. Cor. 8. 3. he
loves Gods Word, he delights in the law of the Lord in his inner man, Romans 7.
22. thy commandments are my delights, Psalm. 119. 143. he loves his servants,
by this we know we are translated from death to life, because we love the
brethren, 1. John 3. 14. Yea, this love he bears to God, is the root of all
his obedience. His obedience proceeds rather and more from love, than from
fear. Deuteronomy. 7. 9. He keeps covenant and mercy to them that love him, and
keep his commandments. Which sentence you shall find repeated twice in the
very same words. Neh. 1. 5. Dan. 9. 4. his love to God is that that makes him
careful to keep his commandments. His love to men also grows from this
root. 1. John 5. 2. By this we know, that we love the children of God, when
we love God. Heb. 6. 10. God is not unrighteous to forget your love, which ye
have showed toward his Name, in that ye have ministered to the Saints, and
still do minister. Yea, even his fear of God proceeds of love. Hos. 3. 5.
They shall seek the Lord their God, and fear him, and his goodness.

And for the second branch, this love of the regenerate man grows 2.
from faith, even from the assurance he has of Gods love to him in Christ. 1.
Tim. 1. 5. The end of the commandment is charity, out of a pure heart, and of
a good conscience, and of Faith unfeigned. 1. Ioh. 4. 19. We love him, because
he loved us first But what love is that he speaks of? The natural man may
pretend he loves God, because God loved him first, as Acts 14. 17. He has done
us good, and given us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, and filled our
hearts with food and gladness. But if a man know no further love of God than
that, have no better fruit of Gods love than that, he can never be able soundly
to love the Lord: till he know God has loved him in Christ, he can never be
soundly persuaded of Gods love, nor soundly love the Lord again. This is the
love that John means in that place, when he says, 1. John 5. 19. We love him,
because he loved us first: as is plain, verse 10. Herein is love, not that we
loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be a reconciliation for
our sins. And 1. John 3. 16. Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he
laid down his life for us. So Luke 7. 47. Her sins which were many, are
forgiven: for she loved much. And every one that can find this love in him to
God, and that the service he does to God, he does it of love, may be sure his
heart is upright in him. 1. Cor. 8. 3. If any man love God, the same is known
of him. Thus our Savior seeks to recover and comfort Peter, making known to
him the uprightness of his heart by this, and to prove unto him, that though
he fell fearfully, ye he fell not totally. John 21. 15. Love thou me? love
thou me? as if he should say, Remember, that though thou seemedst even to hate
me by denying me, yet thou love me still. On the other side, no hypocrite or
natural man, does that he does of love, specially not out of such a love as
grows from Faith unfeigned. It is evident, that for the most part all his
obedience grows from fear. What good duty soever they do, wherein they have
any respect to God, they use to do it of fear, and not of love. Psalm 78.
34. When he slew them, they sought him, and they returned, and sought God
early. And what things soever he seems to do of love to God, it is but a
counterfeit and unsound love: for, first, he loves not Gods Word, but hates it.
John 3. 19, 20. He loves darkness rather than light, because his deeds are
evil: every one that does evil, hates the light. 1. John 2. 5. He that
keeps his word, in him is the love of God perfect indeed; hereby we know that
we are in him. Secondly, he loves not Gods servants, but hates them. John 15.
19. Because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world,
therefore the world hates you. Thirdly, he has no faith, nor assurance of
Gods love to him in Christ. Ephesians. 2. 12. Ye were at that time without Christ,
and were alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and were strangers from
the covenant of promise, and had no hope, and were without God in the world.

Lecture the hundred and five. October 15. 1611. JOHN IIII. L.
IT remains ^ow, that we come to the fourth and last note of difference, that
may be observed between the obedience of the regenerate and natural man, in
the manner of performing good duties: And that is this, Note 4.
The regenerate man is constant in his obedience to God. This we shall find is
a chief, and one of the most certain and sensible notes of an upright heart.
For there is scarce any one good thing that is in Gods child, but it may seem
to be in the hypocrite, save only this. We will therefore show, first, that in
every regenerate man this may be found: secondly, that it can be found in none
other. The first is plain, Pro. 10. 25. The righteous is an everlasting
foundation: he is no changling. You shall see this constancy of his estate:
first, in the grace of regeneration it self; for the nature and essential
property of it, is to be constant: and thus it may be discerned and known. The
spirit of regeneration is like unto that holy fire, that came down from
Heaven, and was kept in the Sanctuary, that never went out, Leuit. 6. 12, 13.
If ever a man had grace, he can never lose it. It is called therefore an
immortal seed, 1. Pet. 1. 23. The good part that shall never be taken away
from him that has once received it, Luke 10. 42. An everlasting name, that
shall not be put out, Esaias 56. 5. Secondly, in the fruits and effects of it.
Psalm. 92. 13, 14. Such as be planted in the house of the Lord, shall bring
forth fruit in their age. And thus shall those good duties, which are the
fruits of true grace, be discerned from such as proceed from some other root.
If a man do truly love the Word, and the profession of it, he will persevere
in his love, and profession, and never forsake it, Matthew. 13. 20, 21. of that
hearer that heard the Word, and incontinently with joy received it, and endured
but for a season; our Savior says the cause was, because he had no root in
himself: He never had sound heart. And 1. John. 2. 19. They went out from us,
but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued
with us. So is it likewise in all other good duties which any man has been
given to: if they were the fruits of grace, if ever a man did use to do them
with a good heart, he will do them still. I cannot stand upon all good duties
in particular; I will instance but in one, whereby we may judge of all the
rest, for there is the like reason for all. If ever a man were wont to be
merciful and liberal in relieuing Gods poor servants out of a good heart, he
will be so still. You shall see this, Esaias 32. 8. The liberal man will devise
of liberal things (that is, he will study and think with himself which of
Gods servants stand in need, and how he may show himself merciful to them)
and he will continue his liberality. Another notable place there is for this,
Heb. 6. The Apostle says of the Hebrews, verse 9. He was persuaded there were
better things in them (than in such hypocrites as he had spoken of before) and
such as accompanied salvation. And verse 10. he gives this for the reason: in
that (says he) ye have ministered to the Saints, and yet minister, and he
adds, verse 11. We desire that every one of you show the same diligence to the
end. And why so? To the full assurance of hope, says he. As if he should have
said, There is no full assurance of hope, no not in so excellent a fruit of
faith, as this is, unless ye continue to the end.

Two objections you may (happily) make against this, which I must give you to
answer to.

That in many that have been truly regenerate, great intermissions, Object. 1.
and giving over of good duties have been found, the fruits of grace have
been strangely interrupted, and broken off in them. He that had come to David
at that time when after his adultery, he practiced the death of Uriah; or to
Peter when he forsware his Master, and with such direful curses denied that he
knew him; would have been able to discern no more fruits of grace, nor
conscience of their duty to God in them, than in Saul, or Judas. A man
therefore, you will say, may be Gods child, and have a sound heart, though he
be not thus constant in his obedience as you have said.

To this I answer, first, That though in the time of temptation, or of some
spiritual desertion, the case may be thus with Gods child for a Answ.
time, yet he cannot continue so, but he shall recover himself, and do his
first works again: according to that, Psalm. 55. 22. He will not suffer the
righteous to fall for ever. Secondly, that during the time of this his fall,
and giving over the practice of those good duties he was wont to perform, the
child of God has lost the assurance of his hope, and of the soundness and
uprightness of his own heart; neither can any other man, or himself, say
that any good thing he did before, was done in truth now he has given it over.
And indeed if thou observe it, thou shall find that none such take any comfort
at all to hear, or think of any good thing he did in times past. Herein I
may appeal to the consciences of every one of you (if any such be here) that
were in times past diligent, zealous, and conscionable Preachers, or such as
used conscionably and carefully to pray in private, or such as were careful to
have the exercises of Religion in your families, and have now quite given over
these things; is it any comfort to you that you were such kind of people in
times past? Nay is it not rather a vexation to your minds to think of those
times, because your hearts are apt to tell you all that was done but in
hypocrisy? Certainly, till you recover your selves, and do your first works
again, you cannot have any assurance, that there was ever any truth or
soundness in your hearts.

Yea, but (will you say) though they that are quite fallen from the good duties
they were wont to perform, can have no assurance of the truth of Object. 2.
their hearts, yet there is many a one that has a good heart, that yet finds
great inconstancy in himself, and that he often omits the good duties he should
perform, and has not at all times that aptness and alacrity in prayer, and
such like holy exercises, as he has at some times. Can such a one have no
assurance of the uprightness and soundness of his heart?

I answer: First, that it is certain, that many a good man may decay in the
Answ.
measure of his practice, and doing of good duties, even through a natural
decay of his spirits; by age, or sickness. Secondly, he may also lose that
heat and feruency of spirit that sometimes he had. This is plain in the Angel
of the Church of Ephesus, Apoc. 2. 4. He had left his first love. and yet had
much grace in him still. verse 2. I know how thou can not forbear them that
are evil. And verse 6. Thou hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also
hate. Yea, without daily watchfulness, and stirring up of our selves, it will
not be possible to keep our selves from this decaying in our first love, and
feruency in good duties, if we do not exhort and stir up our selves daily, we
shall be in danger to be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin, Heb. 3. 13.
But yet this you shall find in every regenerate man ordinarily, unless it be
in that case of tentation and spiritual desertion, that I spoke of in the
former objection: First, he does still perform good duties of conscience
toward God, though not with that cheerfulness and aptness, as at other
times. He keeps his way still, and goes on, though not so fast and comfortably
as he was wont; grieuing for his decaies, and striving against his dullness,
and this God greatly delights in even in this Labor of love, as the Apostle
calls it, Heb. 6. 10. Secondly, he rests not in any thing he has done, but is
careful to persevere, and continue to the end. For this we have two notable
examples: First, in David, Psalm. 146. 2. I will praise the Lord during my life,
as long as I have any being, I will sing unto my God. And 101. 2. I will do
wisely in the perfect way, till thou come to me. And Psalm. 119. 11^. I have
applied my heart to fulfill thy statutes always, even unto the end. The second
is in Paul, Phil. 3. 12. One thing I do (as if he should say, this is the
chief thing I have to comfort my self in) I forget that that is behind, and
endeavor my self to that which is before. Thirdly, he lives in fear, lest he
should fall away before his death, and having begun in the spirit, should end
in the flesh. Ier. 32. 40. I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall
not depart from me. Fourthly, he desires to continue under the means of
grace. Psalm. 27. 4. One thing I have desired of the Lord, and that I will
require, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.
And whosoever is thus constant, and careful to persevere, may be certain of
the soundness and uprightness of his heart. No natural man ever was so. John
8. 31. If ye continue in my Word, ye are verily my Disciples. Psalm. 106. 3.
Blessed are they that keep judgment, and do righteousness at all times.
Pro. 28. 14. Happy is the man that fears always. It is said of Caleb, he had
another spirit than the rest of the spies, Number. 14. 24. and the reason is there
given, but more plainly, Josh. 14 9. because he followed the Lord constantly.
He that serves God constantly, certainly has another spirit in him, than ever
any natural man could attain unto.

And thus have we finished the examination of the three first graces which I
propounded, and wherein I said I would observe the difference betwixt the good
things that are in the regenerate man, and those that seem to be in the
natural man. I have showed you the difference between them in their
knowledge, in their repentance, and in their obedience unto God. It follows
now, that we proceed to the fourth and last: namely, to the faith and
confidence that they have in the mercy of God. First then, every regenerate man
has says. No one grace, no goodness at all can be in that man's heart in
soundness and uprightness, that wants a lively faith, that is not in some
measure truly assured of Gods favor to him in Christ. For that is the root of
all saving graces, Acts 5. 9. It purifieth the heart: and 26, 18. it
sanctifies him that has it.

And on the other side, the man that has any measure of true faith, though it
be very weak, doubtless, has a sound and upright heart. This is plain in
the words of Hanani the Prophet to Asa, 2. Chron. 16. 9. The eyes of the Lord
behold all the earth, to show himself strong with them that are of a perfect
heart toward him. But whom means he by them that are of a perfect heart?
Surely, such as rest upon him, as you shall see in the former verse.

But herein also many a natural man and hypocrite seems to match the child
of God; yea to exceed him much. He says, he has a strong faith, and is as
fully persuaded of Gods favor, as any other man. Ier. 3. 4. Did thou not
still cry unto me (says the Lord to the wicked hypocrite) Thou art my father,
and the guide of my youth. And Micah. 3. 11. Yet they will lean upon God, and
say, Is not the Lord amongst us? no evil can come to us. Yea, he may live and
dye in a strong persuasion, that he is in Gods favor. How then shall we be
able (will you say) to distinguish between the true faith of the regenerate,
and the false and vain presumption of the natural man? Four sensible and
plain notes of difference I will give you out of Gods Word, between the true
faith of the regenerate man, and the seeming faith of him that has no grace in
his heart.

The first is from the means, whereby it is wrought in a man For the faith of
the regenerate, is wrought in him by the Ministry of the Word of God, and is
increased and nourished by it, and by the other good means of grace which God
has ordained: First, by the preaching of the Law his heart is humbled and
prepared, John Baptist by his ministry was to prepare the way for Christ, Mark
1. 2. Secondly, by the preaching of the Gospel his heart is comforted. Romans
10. 17. Faith comes by hearing. Esaias 57. 19. I create the fruit of the lips to
be peace. Art thou then able to say, thy faith was wrought in thee by the
Ministry of the Word? it wrought in thee first the spirit of bondage, and then
the spirit of adoption, Romans 8. 15. and thou find it cherished, and made
more lively and strong, when thou do diligently and conscionably attend upon
Gods ordinance, in hearing, reading, praying, and receiving of the Lords
Supper; then have thou cause to judge, that thy assurance is indeed the faith
of Gods Elect, against which, the gates of hell shall never be able to
prevail. On the other side, if thou never foundest any such power or comfort
in the Word, but thy assurance has grown with thee even from the womb, thou
were never of other mind thou thankest God: neither the ministry of the law did
ever work in thy heart any sound and lasting humiliation, nor the ministry of
the Gospel any great comfort: thou carest not for the ministry of the Word,
nor find any relish in any religious exercise, but wonderest at their folly,
that make such reckoning of them; then be thou assured, that thy confidence is
but presumption, and not faith.

The second difference is in the grounds, on which their faith is founded. The
third in the measure and degrees of it. The fourth and last, in the fruits and
effects of it. But for these three last notes, I must refer the Reader to the
76 Lecture, where I have handled them at large.

THE HUNDRED AND SIXTH LECTVRE, ON OCTOBER XXII. MDCXI.
JOHN IIII. L. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him,
and he went his way.


WE have already heard, that from the beginning of the 46. Verse, to the end of
this Chapter, the Evangelist does set down the History of the second miracle
that our Savior wrought in Galile, in curing the son of a certain Ruler:
And that the History stands upon four parts: First, the occasion that was
offered to Christ to do this miracle, Uers. 46, 47. Secondly, the manner how
Christ wrought this miracle, Uerse 48, 49. and the beginning of this Uerse.
Thirdly, the fruit and effect of this miracle. Fourthly and lastly, the
conclusion of the story. The two first parts we have already finished, and are
now to proceed to the third; namely, to the fruit and effect of this miracle,
which begins in the words I have now read unto you, and lasts to the end
of the 53. Verse.

And in this part there be three principal things to be considered: First, the
beginning of the faith and conversion of this Ruler, in these words of the 50
Verse, And the man believed the words that Jesus had spoken unto him, and went
his way. Secondly, the means whereby this faith that was begun in him, was
confirmed and increased, in Verse 51, 52. and part of 53. Thirdly, the
confirmation and stablishment which he received in his faith by these means,
and the fruit whereby he declared it, in the latter end of the 53 Verse.

Now for the first, it is said, that the man believed the word that Jesus had
spoken unto him: and to declare, that he did so indeed, he gave over
importuning him any more, and went his way. It may seem somewhat strange (if
we mark it well) to see so great and sudden a change wrought in this great man.
Even now he was of that mind, that he would not believe, unless he might see
signs and wonders; now he belieues Christ's bare word, though he did see
nothing at all done. Before he thought Christ could do his son no good,
unless he would go down to him to see him, and pray over him, or touch him,
and use some solemn ceremony about him; now he belieueth his son is
recovered, though Christ did none of all these, but only spoke the word. And
if we enquire into the causes of it, we shall find them to be principally two;
the first in the Lord, the other in himself.

First, the Lords gracious pleasure was the cause of this, who works man's
conversion, when and by what means it pleases him (Ioh. 3. 8. The wind blows
where it lists) and who had appointed this to be the time of this Noblemans
conversion; and this word of Christ to be the means whereby it should be
wrought. This should make us careful to be constant hearers of the Word. For,
first, some point of great importance may be taught in one Sermon, which
(happily) we shall not hear again in an hundred. Secondly, though at all times
Gods Elect may profit by their hearing, yet has God his times and moments
(determined with himself) wherein he will work with his Word, more mightily
than at other times. And who can tell which is the Sermon that God has
appointed to do him most good by? We should therefore frequent Sermons, as good
husbands do their faires and markets; and provident Merchants the times of the
Royal Exchange, that no opportunity of a good bargain may escape them.

Secondly, his heart was well prepared to receive good by Christ; both by that
hand of God that was upon him in the sickness of his son, and also by that
reverend and good opinion he had conceived of Christ, by that that he had
heard, or seen of him before; he esteemed him to be a great Prophet, one that
was able and willing to do him good. And this reverend opinion he had conceived
of him, made him willing (as great as he was) to come himself to him so great
a way. Now by these means his heart was much better prepared, and made fit to
give credit unto that that Christ should say unto him, than otherwise it would
have been. From this first point then we have this Doctrine to learn, That

It is a matter of great use and necessity for our profiting by the Word, to
Doct. 1.
come to it with a heart that is rightly prepared. The man that brings to the
Word a prepared heart, shall receive more good by once hearing of it, than
another shall do at many times. True it is, that many a man has received some
good by the Word, and felt himself much moved by it, that yet has come to it
without a due preparation: as not only Agrippa that was almost caught, Act. 26.
28. but even Foelix also: Paul's ministry wrought mightily upon his heart, it
made him to quake and tremble, Act. 24. 26. and Herod (though doubtless his
heart was never well prepared when he came to hear John) yet can it not be
denied, but he received much good by hearing him, he heard him gladly, and
reformed his life in many things by hearing of him, Mar. 6. 20. Yea many have
felt a divine power in the Ministry of the Word, as have come to it with very
bad hearts; such were those officers that were sent to apprehend our Savior,
John 7. 46. Yea sometimes God has so far forth glorified his power in this
his own ordinance, as he has wrought thereby even the effectual conversion
of some that have come to it without all good preparation of heart: as the
Athenians which heard Paul, Act. 17. first, with what hearts they came to hear
him, it is plain, Ver. 18. Some said, what will this babbler say? and the best
of them heard him only out of a desire to hear news, Verse. 21. and yet see
how God wrought by that Sermon in the hearts of sundry of them, Verse. 34.
Howbeit certain men claue to Paul, and believed, among whom also was Denis
Areopagita, and a woman named Damaris, and other with them. And (upon these
experiments) it were much to be wished, that all men, even the wickedest, would
be brought to hear, yea though they came but by occasion, or as intending some
other thing; yea, though they came even with an evil intent to carp, or to
mock, yet I would they would come. Possibly they might be caught, though they
came even with such hearts. Yea, it were to be wished, that such as can by no
other means be drawn to hear, might even be compelled, and forced to it by
Authority. Josiah is commended for this, 2 Chro. 34. 33. That he compelled all
that were found in Israel, to serve the Lord; and if you look into Jeremy, and
others that prophesied in Iosiahs time, you shall find there was many a
notorious lewd man in Israel in those days. And if there be any part of Gods
service that men may and ought to be compelled unto, certainly it is rather
this than any other; therefore even the excommunicate persons (by the ancient
Canons of the Church) were allowed to come to the Sermon. It is therefore a
great error in any to imagine, that it is to no purpose to urge such and such
to come to Church, because they think they are either so sottish, or so lewd,
that they can receive no good by coming: and therefore it matters not whether
they come or no.

But though all this be so as you have heard, yet first, this is a singular
help and furtherance to our profiting by the Word, to come to it with a
prepared heart: secondly, and where God means his Word shall prosper to work
saving grace, there he prepares the hearts of men to receive it: thirdly,
neither does it ordinarily prevail to work true faith, and sound conversion,
but in a prepared heart. The former examples are very rare. Mark this
therefore in the course God has been wont to keep in the conversion of men;
either by his miracles and strange works, or by his corrections, or by the
terrors of the Law, he has been wont to fit the hearts of his elect to
receive the Gospel. Acts 5. 14. The number of them that believed in the Lord,
both of men and women, grew more and more. Mark the reason, Verse 11, 12. By
his fearful judgments on Ananias and Saphira, and sundry other strange
miracles wrought by the Apostles, God had prepared the hearts of men notably,
to the receiving of the Gospel. Acts 12. 24. The Word of God grew and
multiplied. Mark the reason, Ver. 23. By a strange judgment on proud Herod,
God had prepared men's hearts. Act. 19. 10. The Word of God grew mightily, and
prevailed. See the reason, Ver. 11. 17. By the wonderful miracles Paul
wrought, and the strange judgments that befell the sons of Sceua for
counterfeiting of them, a marvelous fear came upon them all in those parts;
and thus were they prepared to receive the Word.

For the second, we have Job 33. 23. If there be then an Interpreter. As if he
should say, Then there will be great hope of doing good. And for the third, we
have Act. 2. 41. The same day there were added to them about three thousand
souls. Mark the reason, Ver. 37. They were pricked in their heart with that
which Peter had said. And this is Gods usual course: he sends John Baptist
before Christ to preach the Law. Why? Mar. 1. 2, 3. To prepare the hearts of
men to receive Christ.

And as the Word seldom preuailes at first, to the conversion of men, till the
heart be prepared to receive it: so it is certain that it seldom preuailes to
confirm and increase grace, unless men come to it with prepared hearts. As in
prayer it makes much to a man's comfort, to prepare himself to it: so is it
also in this duty. When the people of God were to receive the Law, God
commanded they should prepare themselves to receive it. Exodus 19. 10. Go to
the People, and sanctify them to day, and to morrow, and let them wash their
clothes, and be ready on the third day. Yea when Samuel offered a sacrifice
unto the Lord at Bethlehem, 1 Samuel 16. 5. He sanctified less and his sons
before he called them to it. And it is noted as the best thing that was in
Iehoshaphat, 2 Chronicles. 19. 3. That he prepared his heart to seek God.

The reason of the doctrine is, That our hearts are ordinarily profane, and
Reas. 1.
unfit to deal with holy things; naturally they are so, and (by dealing with
worldly things) they are made so more and more. Act. 10. 14. Common and
unclean are made all one. Mar. 7. 2 Common hands are unclean hands: and
certainly of our thoughts and affections it may more truly be said, take them
as they are commonly, and they are unclean and profane. We must strive to have
other than our ordinary and common thoughts and affections, when we are to
deal with God, or else we shall go about to sow good seed among thorns, Ier.
4. 8. Yea worse than so; for it is not only the loss of the seed, but the
loss of our selves also. There must be a proportion kept between the vessel
and the wine, or else both will be lost: Luke 5. 37, 38. New wine must be put
into new vessels, so both are preserved. Men use to wash the cups that are to
receive their drink, and the dishes that are to receive their meat: but they
have more need to cleanse and sanctify their hearts, that are to receive the
Word. For, first, the heart is fowler than any cup or vessel can be, The heart
of man is desperately wicked, Ier. 17. 9. Secondly, put a clean thing into an
unclean vessel, and it will receive pollution by it. If one that is unclean
touch any of these, shall it be unclean? and the Priest answered and said, it
shall be unclean, Hag. 2. 13. Thirdly, the honesty and uprightness of the
heart gives the price and worth to every good duty we perform, and accordingly
God does esteem of it. Our hearts are (like Instruments) ever out of tune; we
must either every time that we go to serve God, take some pains to set them in
tune, or we shall never make good music in the ears of God. That made David
say, Psalm. 57. 7, 8. Mine heart is prepared, O Lord, mine heart is prepared, I
will sing and give praise: awake my tongue, awake violl and harp, I will awake
early.

The first use of this Doctrine, is, to exhort us not to despise, or neglect
the Lords preparations. When God has (by any means) fitted after a special
Use 1.
manner, and prepared thy heart unto his service; take the time, neglect not
the opportunity, for then shall thou be able to serve God with more fruit and
comfort, than at another time: strike while the Iron is hot, James 5. 13. Is
any afflicted? let him pray: Is any merry? let him sing. So when God by his
corrections has softened and humbled thy heart, then give thy self to reading
and meditation of the Word, thou shall profit more by it then, a great deal,
than at another time. Psalm. 119. 92. Except thy Law had been my delight, I
should have perished in mine affliction. He found (doubtless) more sweetness
in it then, than at another time.

The second use of the Doctrine, is, to show to us the true cause why we profit
so little by the Word, and find so small comfort in it, surely we seldom Use.
2.
or never come rightly prepared to it. We find great comfort and profit in our
prayers when the heart is prepared before: this is therefore spoken of a
condition required in all those prayers that God will give gracious answer
unto. If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him, Job
11. 13. Thou will prepare their heart, thou will cause thine ear to hear,
Psalm. 10. 17. So is it with the Word; men use to come to it with common hearts;
nay, often with worse than common hearts. If we had care of this, we should find
more power and sweetness in one Sermon, than we are wont to do in an hundred.
And because we must not serve God only at such times, as he by affliction, or
such like means has prepared us after a special manner; but as we must pray
every day, Pray without ceasing, 1 These. 5. 17. so must we exercise our selves
in Gods word every day, even of the King it is said, He shall read therein all
the days of his life, Deuteronomy. 17. 19. and if we come not rightly prepared to it,
we shall receive little good by it, nay we shall be in danger to receive much
hurt by it. As we cannot do the work of our Ministry well unless we sanctify
our selves: Sanctify your selves, and prepare your brethren, said good Iosia
to the Priests, 2 Chro. 35. 6. so neither can you do the duty of hearers well,
unless you sanctify your selves before you come. I will therefore show you
how a man's heart should come prepared to the hearing of the Word, that desires
to receive comfort by it; what affection and disposition of heart we should
bring with us.

We must not come in our sins unto Gods house; but labor to cast off (by 1.
unfeigned repentance) all our known sins, before we come. In this respect
the wisdom of the Church is to be commended, in beginning our public worship
with a holy and good confession of sins: it were to be wished, that men would
make more conscience to join with the congregation in it, and to do it with
feeling and understanding hearts, than the most do. This is that that was
signified by putting off the shoes, and washing of the clothes, Exo. 3. 5 and
19. 10. and is more plainly taught, I am. 1. 21. Lay apart all filthiness, and
superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the ingrafted word. In
this respect it is worthy to be observed, that (Ezekiel. 23. 38, 39.) the Lord
notes this for a circumstance, that greatly aggrauated their whoredoms and
murders, That they came the same day into Gods Sanctuary. And what marvel is
it then, that so many receive no profit, but hurt rather by the Word; being
guilty of heinous sins, they come to Gods house, without the least motion of
remorse for them, or purpose to forsake them? Yea, many come on the Lords day
to Gods house, having spent the greatest part of the night before, some in
drunkenness, some in gaming, and other disorders.

We must labor to bring our hearts to a religious fear of the Majesty of 2.
God, with whom we have to deal, and in whose presence we are to appear in a
special sort. Set thy self as in Gods presence, and that will keep thy heart
from wandering. Acts 10. 33. We are all here present before God (says
Cornelius) to hear all things that are commanded thee of God. That which
Solomon uses as a reason, to restrain men from rashness, and irreuerence in
prayer serves as fitly to restrain from rashness and irreuerence in hearing:
for reverence is as well required when God speaks to us, as when we speak to
God. Eccl. 5. 1. Be not rash with thy mouth, nor let thy heart be hasty to
utter a thing before God: for God is in the heavens, and thou art on the earth.
This fear of God (rising from the apprehension of his glorious presence) is a
singular means to prepare the heart to hear well. Thus God prepared Abraham,
Genesis 15. 12. A fearful darkness fell upon him first, and then the Lord
delivered to him the word of promise. Serve the Lord with fear, Psalm. 2. 11.
and 5. 7. I will come to thy house in the multitude of thy mercies, and in thy
fear will I worship toward thy holy Temple. No marvel then, though many
profit so little, both in their coming into Gods house, and sitting in it; The
very trial of their countenance testifies against them: as Esa. 3. 9. that
there is no fear, nor reverence of Gods presence in their hearts.

Thou must rid thy heart of all prejudice and hard conceit of him thou art to
hear, and labor to be well persuaded of thy Teacher. This has great 3.
force to further our profiting by that we hear. This was that that made Herod
himself not only to hear John gladly, but also to practice many things he
taught, Mar. 6. 20. This made Paul so earnest in protesting his love, and
declaring his affection to them he wrote to, that he might win them thereby
to have a good opinion of him, because he knew how much this would avail to
their profiting by his Doctrine: See how many words he uses to persuade both
the Romans and Corinthians of this, in the beginning of his Epistles unto
them, Romans 1. 8, 15. 1 Cor. 1. 4, 8. This made him so earnest with the
faithful in that exhortation, And we beseech you brethren, to know them which
labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; and esteem
them very highly in love for their works sake, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 12, 13.

We must bring with us an appetite, even an earnest desire to profit by that 4.
we shall hear, As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the Word, 1
Pet. 2. 2. This will greatly further our profiting; for the Lord uses to fill
the hungry with good things, and to send the rich empty away, Luke 1. 53.

We must bring with us an honest heart, even a sincere purpose and resolution,
5.
to obey the Word in all things, and to learn to know the will of God, to no
other end, but that we may direct our lives according to it: resolving, as Esaias
2. 3. Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and he will teach
us his ways, and we will walk in his paths. And as Psalm. 119. 34. I will
observe thy Law with my whole heart. Such shall be sure to profit, If any man
will do his will, he shall know of the Doctrine, whether it be of God, Ioh. 7.
17. What man is he that fears the Lord, him shall he teach in the way that he
shall choose, Psalm. 25. 12.

We must use to pray before we come. We must (Pro. 2. 3.) call (unto 6.
God) for knowledge, and cry for understanding: Verse 5. Then shall we
understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God. And the reason
is added, Uer. 6. For the Lord gives wisdom, out of his mouth comes
knowledge and understanding: As if he should say, it comes not out of the mouth
of the excellentest man that thou can hear, it comes from the Lord only;
and therefore thou must seek to him for it.

THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTH LECTVRE, ON OCTOBER XXIX. MDCXI.
JOHN IIII. LI, LII, LIII. And as he was now going down, his servants met him,
and told him saying, Thy son lives.

Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend; and they said unto
him, Yesterday, at the seventh hour the Fever left him.

So the father knew, that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said
unto him, Thy son lives; and himself believed, and his whole house.


WE have already heard, that from the beginning of the 46 Uerse, to the end of
this Chapter, the Evangelist does set down the History of the second miracle
that Christ wrought in Galile, in curing of the son of a certain Ruler. And
that the History stands upon four parts: First, the occasion that was offered
unto Christ to do this miracle, Uers. 46, 47 Secondly, the manner how Christ
wrought this miracle, Verse. 48, 49. and the beginning of the 50. Thirdly, the
fruit and effect of this miracle, from the latter end of the 50 Verse, to the
end of the 53. Fourthly, the conclusion of the story, in the 54 Uerse. And in
the fruit and effect of this miracle (which is the third part of the story) we
have heard there be three principal things to be observed; First, the
beginning of the faith and conversion of this Ruler, in the words of the 50
Verse. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and went
his way. Secondly, the means whereby this faith, that was begun in him, was
confirmed and increased, in these words I have now read unto you. Thirdly, the
confirmation and stablishment which he received in his faith by these means,
and the fruit whereby he declared it, in the latter end of the 53 Uerse. The
first of these three points we finished the last day; it remains now, we come
unto the second: namely, unto the means, whereby the faith that was begun in
him, was confirmed and increased. Now in these words two principal things are
to be considered: First, his servants meeting of him, and bringing him word of
his sons recovery, Verse 51. Secondly, the enquiry he made of them concerning
the just time of his sons recovery, and the satisfaction that he received
therein, Uerse 52, 53. For the first, it is worthy to be observed here, what
care these servants had of the comfort of their Master: first, they knew how
much the sickness and danger of his son did disquiet and trouble him.
Secondly, they knew that he was gone to Cana unto Christ, to seek help for
him. Thirdly, so soon therefore as they perceived that the child was recovered,
they come to tell him, that they might ease him of his grief, and comfort him;
and would not let him abide in his grief, till he might come home, and see his
son recovered, but they come to bring him the news of it. Fourthly, there
comes not one servant only to bring him this news, but sundry of them, each
of them being unwilling (as it should seem) to be ouer-gone by another in this
duty to their Master. Fifthly, yea, they showed great care not to deceive their
Master with false news; and therefore they did not come forth so soon as they
perceived the child began to mend, (for it is said, they met not with their
Master, till the day after the child began to amend: and Cana being but five
miles (or thereabout) from Capernaum, and the child beginning to mend about one
of the clock in the afternoon, they might have been with him the same day,
if they had come forth presently) but they would be well assured, that he did
mend indeed; and therefore they tarried a while, that they might have some
proof of his amendment, before they went: and thereupon they come, and tell
their Master confidently, Thy son lives: that is, he is recovered, and past
the danger of this his sickness; The sever has left him, as Verse 52. The
Doctrine that we are to learn from the example of these servants, is this,
That it is the duty of every servant to love his Master, to desire and seek
the comfort of his Doct. 1.
Master. This Doctrine concerning the duty of servants (peradventure) will
seem to many not very profitable, or fit to be stood upon. But I would have
such to consider, First, that my Text draws me to it, and I must not seek
matter, but take such as my Text gives me direct occasion to speak of.
Secondly, that this is a Doctrine very necessary to be taught sometimes.
Observe (I pray you) in the Epistles of the Apostles, how often this point is
taught, and with what earnestness it is urged, Ephesians. 6. Colos. 3. 1 Timothy 6.
Tit. 2. 1 Peter 2. And mark how the Apostle concludes it, 1 Timothy 6. 2. These
things teach and exhort. And Tit. 2. 15. These things speak, and exhort, and
rebuke with all authority. I will therefore handle this point as briefly and
profitably as I can, so as not servants only, but all you that hear me, may
receive some benefit and edification by it.

This is then the Doctrine, That every servant is bound to love his Master, to
desire and seek the comfort of his Master. And that which you shall hear me
speak concerning the duty that the servant owes to the Master, you must
understand to be meant as well of the duty that the servant owes to the
Mistress. For there is the like reason for both; and thus runs the Commandment,
whereby all inferiors are taught their duty to their superiors, Exodus 20. 12.
Honor thy Father, and thy Mother: that is, the superior of either sex. Say a
servant should be never so true unto his Master, never so diligent, never so
profitable, yet if he love not his Master, if he desire not by all the means
he can, to procure the comfort of his Master, he has not discharged his duty
before God. We have here in the Text an example of servants, that yet were not
converted to the Faith, and it should be a foul shame for servants that
profess the Gospel, to go behind them in this duty to their Masters. But I
will give you examples also of such servants, as no Christian servant, of what
degree soever, can disdain to propound to himself for his imitation. The one
is Eleazar Abraham's servant, and steward of his house, of whose love to his
Master, and care to procure his Masters comfort, we shall read, Genesis 24. He saw
what a trouble it was to Abraham when he was old, for fear his son Isaac
should take a wife of the Canaanites, and what a comfort it would be to him, if
he might see him matched with one of his own kindred. See the marvelous love
of this man to his Master, and care he had of his comfort: First, in the
diligence he showed in the business, Ver. 33. When he was come to Labans
house, they set meat before him, but he would not eat till he had done his
Masters business. And so soon as he had obtained his suit, and done his
business (though his entertainment were very good) he would not be stayed one
day longer, but would needs return to his Master with all speed; as you shall
find, Ver. 54, 56. because he knew well what a comfort it would be to his
Master, when he had understood how he had sped. Secondly, you shall observe his
love to his Master, in the joy he took in that good success God had given him
in his business, (not so much in respect of himself, or any reward he looked
to receive for his good service, but) even for his Masters sake, because he
knew how great a comfort it would be to his Master. See this, Ver. 26, 27. when
he perceived, that God had brought him directly and safely to Bethuels house;
The man bowed himself, and worshipped the Lord, and said, Blessed be the Lord
God of my Master Abraham, which has not with-drawne his mercy and truth from
my Master. See still all his respect was to his Master: A good servant will
rejoice in his Masters comfort as much as in his own, it will do him good to
see his Master prosper. The other example is Nehemia, who was Cup Bearer or
Taster to the greatest Emperor that was then in the world: and he professes
of himself, Neh. 2. 1. That he had never been wont to be sad in the presence
of his Master. Why? was that unlawful? No, doubtless, it well beseemes a
Christian to be sad sometimes, Sorrow is better than laughter, for by the
sadness of the countenance (that inward grief which cannot be hid, but shows
it self in the countenance) the heart is made better, Eccles. 7. 3. but his
Master liked it not, he knew it would discontent his Master, as appears, Verse.
2. he was sore afraid, when his Master perceived by his countenance that he was
sad. And though his Master were void of religion, yet he held it his duty to
give contentment to him in this, he did strive to be cheerful in his
countenance always when he came to attend him. I have now given you two
examples for this; I will give you two precepts also, and so come to the
reasons. The first is that the Apostle teaches, Ephesians. 6. 7. when he requires
servants to do that service that they do with good will: he means not in those
words to exempt them from duty and obligation; as if he would say, The service
you do, is done but of courtesy; but though you do no more, than in duty you
are bound to do, yet must you do it of love and good will, or it is naught
worth in Gods sight. So Tit. 2. 9. Let servants be subject to their Masters,
and please them in all things, not answering again. And mark what kind of
servants they were, of whom this duty was required; the yoke that servants did
bear in those days, was an iron yoke, in comparison of that that servants
bear now: For, 1. They were usually bondmen, either won in battle, or
bought with money: and consequently they were 1. bound during life, or at their
Masters pleasure: 2. they could refuse no drudgery they were put to. 2. Their
Masters were most of them Infidels, and enemies to the Gospel. And yet those
servants were bound to love their Masters, and to seek to please them in all
things. How much more are servants now bound to do this, whose yoke is far
more easy and tolerable?

The Reasons of the Doctrine are these. First, love is the root of all duties
we do perform to men: neither can any be well done, unless it proceed Reason.
1
from love; and where there is love, all duties will follow. Romans 13. 9, 10.
Every Commandment is brie^ty comprehended in this saying, even in this; Thou
shall love thy neighbor as thy self: therefore love is the fulfilling of the
law. There be sundry other duties the servant owes to his master, but all
depend upon this: First, he must be obedient unto his Master, Col. 3. 22. In
all things, says the Apostle, and to that end he must be subject to him, not
answering again, Tit. 2. 9. else he cannot be obedient unless he acknowledge
himself to be under him, and can take an angry and cross word patiently, yea,
though it be given without cause: and to that end also he must honor and
reverence him in his heart, They must count their Masters worthy of all honor,
1 Timothy 96. else can he never be subject to him, nor bear his reproof.
Secondly, he must seek his masters profit. Phile. 11. One simus had been an
unprofitable servant, but so soon as he was converted, Paul gives his word for
him, that he would be profitable to his Master. And to that end he must be
faithful and true, Titus 2. 10. Not pickers, but such as show all good
faithfulness: to that end also they must be painful and diligent in their
places: else, though they be never so true, they are unprofitable. Pro. 18. 9.
He that is s^othfull in his work, is even the brother of him that is a great
^aster. But the servant that loves his Master, will make conscience of all
these duties, and none but he.

Every servant is to esteem his Master as a Father. So Naamans servant (that
saw no further than by the light of nature) calls him, 2 King. 5. 13. 2.
And so the Lord himself in the fifth Commandment terms all such as he has
made our superiors in any degree, Exodus 20. 12. because from every one of
them, the inferior receives some benefit, as from a Father. Because God has
made thy Master his instrument of thy maintenance, thou receiuest from God by
his hand, either food and wages, or food and knowledge in some trade, whereby
thou may live the better, and be more profitable to the Commonwealth,
therefore thou art bound to love him, and owe duty unto him.

The third Reason, is in respect of God and his ordinance. How unworthy so ever
the Master himself be of this love, yet because God has set him 3.
over the servant, and will have him to do it, he must love him. This reason
the Apostle gives, Ephesians. 6. 6, 7. The servant must do his service of good will
and love, because therein he serves Christ, does the will of God, he serves the
Lord, and not men, Col. 3. 23. they do it to the Lord, and not to men: and 1 Timothy 6. 1. Every servant must count his Master worthy of all honor. First, of
all honor; not of cap and knee only, etc. but of love and obedience.
Secondly, every Servant must so esteem of his Master, even those that had the
worst Masters. Thirdly, he must count him worthy of all honor. How can that
be, will you say, if he be an idolater, a filthy person, or a drunkard? Yes, in
respect of Gods ordinance, because God will have him to be honored and loved,
he must do it, though there be nothing in the man that deserves honor and
love. Who will not give honor to him, whom the King will have to be honored,
how unworthy soever he be otherwise? Though Mordecai were in Hamans judgment
very base, and one whom he hated extremely, yet ye see how ready he was to
give honor to him, when the King would have him to do it, Est. 6. 11. If God
will have us to love our deadly enemy, that has nothing in him to deserve
love, but the contrary, we must do it, or we can have no comfort in God, Mat.
5. 44. This will greatly adorn and gain credit to the profession of the
Gospel, and nothing more, when men shall see it 4.
works this conscience in servants, that a servant professing religion is more
dutiful, more careful of his Masters comfort and profit, than any other. This
reason the Apostle gives, Tit 2. 10. That they may adorn the Doctrine of God
our Savior in all things: and 1 Timothy 6. 1. That the name of God and his
Doctrine be not evil spoken of. And the credit of the Gospel is dearer to
every true Christian than his own life.

The last reason is, because how unworthy, or unthankful, or unable soever thy
Master is, yet, if of conscience toward God thou do thy duty 5.
thus, thou shall be sure God will reward thee; and so on the other side, if
thou do not thy duty, thou shall have no reward. Ephesians. 6. 8. Know ye that
whatsoever good thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord,
whether he be bond or free. First, the Lord will reward thee in the life to
come, Col. 3. 24. knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of
inheritance. Secondly, even in this life the Lord will reward thee with the
like when thou shall be a Master thy self, with what measure ye mete, it
shall be measured to you again, Mat. 7. 2. Take no heed to all words that
are spoken, lest thou he are thy servant curse thee; For oftentimes also thine
own heart knows, that thou thy self likewise have cursed others, Eccles. 7.
2^, 22.

The Use this Doctrine serves unto, is: first, for Servants; secondly, Use 1.
for Masters also.

And as for servants, before I exhort them to the duty that this Doctrine
requires of them, they are first to be admonished (by way of caution and
prevention) to take heed they be not too careful to please their Masters,
that they show not too much love unto them. The Lord has set you limits and
bounds in this case, which you may not pass. Love and obedience is not
absolutely due to any Master upon earth, so as we may do any thing to please
them, any thing they would have us to do: this honor is due to God alone, whom
the Apostle therefore calls, Jude 4. (...), The only Master. All other Masters
are called twice by the Apostle, Ephesians. 6. 5. Col. 3. 22. Masters according to
the flesh: they have nothing to do with the conscience, that is to be reserved
to God alone, in that case they have a charge given them, ye are bought with a
price, be not ye the servants of men, 1. Cor. 7. 23. I will show you some
particulars, that servants must take heed of in this case: First, a servant may
not, to please his Master, conform himself to a false and idolatrous
religion, this was the thing that Naaman after his conversion was fearful
lest he should offend in 2. Kings 5. 18. Secondly, a servant may not, to please
his Master, lend him his oath, and swear whatsoever he would have him, Genesis
24. 5. As well as Eleazar loved his Master, he would not presently swear when
he bad him, but he would perfectly know the matter he should swear to, and how
he might be able to keep his oath, before he would swear. Thirdly, a servant
may not (to please his Master) execute his malice, and revenge all his
quarrels, as Absolons servants did upon this ground, 2. Sam. 13. 8 Kill him,
fear not, have not I commanded you? but all Saul's servants (save Doeg) refused
to do it, they would not kill the Lords Priests, though the king their master
commanded them, 1. Sam. 22. 17, 18. Fourthly, a servant may not (to please his
Master) counsel him to oppress and wrong his tenants. The Scripture imputes
the oppression that many great men used, to their servants. Amos 4. 1. They
oppress the poor, and destroy the needy, and say unto their Masters Bring,
and let us drink. Fifthly, a servant may not (to please his Master) feed his
humor in his uncleanness and filthiness. Genesis 12. 15. Pharaohs servants saw
Sara, and commended her to Pharaoh, so she was taken into his house. Sixthly, a
servant may not, to please or enrich his Master, tell a lie, or deceive any;
for he shall do his master hurt, and no good, by getting any thing that way.
Pro. 21. 6. The gathering of treasures by a deceitful tongue is vanity, tossed
to and fro of them that seek death. Seventhly, a servant may not, to please
his Master, feed his humor, by bringing him lies and slanders. Pro. 29. 12. If
a Ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked. And Hos. 7. 3. They make
the King glad with their wickedness, and the Princes with their lies. And so
much for the caution, that is to be given unto servants. The exhortation is
this, That every servant would subscribe to this commandment of the Lord, as
well as unto others, and say of it, as Romans 7. 12. This commandment is holy,
and just, and good, and endeavor to show the truth and soundness of that
grace that is in him, by making conscience of his duty in the calling God has
placed him in. Three ways especially there be, whereby thou may show, that
thou do indeed love thy Master: First, if thou seek by all means, and
can rejoice in his prosperity and welfare, as we have heard Eleazar did, Genesis
24. Secondly, if thou can bear with his infirmities, and not blaze them to his
discredit, Servants, be subject to your Masters with all fear, not only to the
good and gentle, but also to the froward, 1. Pet. 2. 18. Thirdly, if thou be
tractable, and willing to please him, and be ruled by him, specially in those
things that concern Gods service and worship: every man in such things should
be willing to please his neighbor, Romans 15. 2. much more should the servant be
willing to please his Master in them.

The Use that Masters are to make of this Doctrine, is: First, to draw them Use
2.
to love Religion, which is such a friend to them, and to desire to have such
servants as are religious. If men were not extremely wicked, this would
persuade them to love the Gospel, that no means, which the wit of man can
devise, have such force to make good subjects, children, servants, and
neighbors, as this has. Secondly, to exhort them to carry themselves so
toward their servants, as they may deserve love and reverence of them. The
fifth Commandment that binds all inferiors, to honor their superiors as
parents, binds all superiors to be as fathers to their inferiors; and indeed
every Master should be so to his servants, even Naaman the Syrian was such a
Master, that made his servant when he spoke unto him, say O my father, 2. King.
5. 13.

Three special ways there be, whereby the Master may gain love and reverence
of his servant.

1. If thou deal justly with him, performing thy covenant with him, paying him
his wages, not oppressing nor wronging him, Masters give unto your servants
that which is just and equal, knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven,
Col. 4. 1.

2. If thou show a love to thy servant, not respecting him only for thine own
advantage, but showing a desire, that he may benefit himself by thy service
also. Our beasts and cattle we may keep only for our own benefit; but in
all our dealings with men (specially Christians) we are bound to respect also
the good of him we deal with, and not our own good only, Look not every man
on his own things, but every man also on the things of others, Phil. 2. 4.
Therefore the Lord gave a Law to Masters, Deuteronomy. 15. 12, 13. that they should
not let their servants go away empty.

3. If thou cause him to perceive in all thy ways, that thou do indeed
fear God, and art wont to be more offended with him, for his sin against
God, than for any neglect of duty to thy self, when the people vow their
obedience unto Joshua, they add this (as the chief thing that would keep them
in this obedience) only the Lord thy God be with thee as he was with Moses,
Josh. 1. 17. This will gain thee reverence, even with a most wicked man, as it
did to John Baptist from Herod himself, Mar. 6. 20. yea, with thine enemy,
when a man's ways please the Lord, even his enemies shall be at peace with
him, Pro. 16. 7. how much more with thine own servant?

Lecture the hundred and eighth. November 12. 1611. JOHN IIII. LII, LIII.
IT follows now, that we proceed unto the second point, which is contained in
the words I have now read unto you: namely, the enquiry which this Ruler made
of his servants, touching the just time of the recovery of his son, and the
satisfaction that he received therein. Where it is to be observed, that this
Ruler (of whom it was said before, that he believed the word that Jesus had
said) does now enquire of the truth of that which Jesus had said. For the
reason that moved him to ask of his servants the just hour when his son
began to amend, was, because he would know whether that were true which Christ
had said, whether he began to amend at that time when Christ said he began to
amend, whether the cure were done by virtue of Christ's word, yea or no: and it
appears by the blessing that followed, that this he did was well done, and
acceptable unto God. The Doctrine then we have to learn here, is this: That it
is not unlawful, nor against faith, but a good sign of faith and grace, for a
Christian to examine and Doct. 2.
make trial of the truth of Gods Word. Two proofs there are of this Doctrine
in the Text: first, this Ruler here, after he had believed, does both enquire,
and move questions concerning that which Christ had said unto him: and
secondly, he is careful to observe, how Christ in deed, and effect, did make
that good which he had spoken unto him.

Object. Why but (may some say) what need he to have made any question, or
sought any confirmation of that which Christ had said, if he had indeed
believed his word, as it is said he did? That honor is due to Gods Word, as we
are to rest in it, to give absolute credit unto it, and make no question of it,
though it seem never so contrary to sense or reason. When God had told Abraham
he should have a son by Sarah, in whom he should be the father of many Nations,
it is said, Romans 4. 18. That he above hope believed under hope, according to
that that was spoken to him. And in so doing, it is said, verse. 20. he gave
glory to God. And so did Noah in a matter that was most unlikely, and that was
not to fall out of an hundred and twenty years after, By faith Noah being
warned of God, of things not seen as yet, moved with fear prepared the Arc,
to the saving of his house, Heb. 11. 7. And on the contrary side, God has been
angry with men for doubting of that which he has spoken, and has punished
them for it, as he did Zacharias, Luke 1. 18. 20.

An. I answer: to make question of any thing God has spoken, as doubting of
it, is a sin; but to move questions concerning that which God has spoken, out
of a desire to be further confirmed in our faith, is a thing most acceptable
unto God. Four notable examples we have for this. When God had promised to
Abraham, that he would give him the land of Canaan to inherit, Abraham asks
him this question, Genesis 15. 8. O Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall
inherit it? And yet before it is said, ver. 6. He believed, and that was
counted to him for righteousness. So Gideon after God had said unto him, that
he should be the deliverer of Israel from the Midianites, and he be believed
also, as it is plain, Judges 6. 34. yet he desires still a further
confirmation, verse 37. and yet another, verse 39. and God was never a whit
offended with him for it. So Hezechia, after he had received Gods Word and
promise for his recovery, and he believed, yet (...). Kin. 20. 8. he desires to
be further confirmed in it, What shall be the sign that the Lord will heal
me? The last example is the blessed Virgin, Luke 1. who though she believed,
verse 45. yet makes a question and doubt verse 34. How shall this be, seeing I
know not man? We see therefore for the first proof, that it is not unlawful to
move some questions of Gods Word, so it be out of a desire to be further
confirmed in the truth. And for the second, Christians may and should observe
carefully, how God makes good his Word, and fulfils in his works that which he
has said in his Word. In this respect we have those Commandments often given us
to observe his works of mercy, to the godly. Psalm. 107. 43. Who is wise that he
may observe these things: he shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord:
and his works of judgment on the wicked. Psalm. 66. 5. Come, and behold the
works of God, he is terrible in his doings to the sons of men: and generally
of both, Psalm. 111. 2. The works of the Lord are great, and ought to be sought
out of them that love them. And on the contrary side, it is noted for a sin
that much prouokes God, when men never observe the works of God, to see how by
them he makes good whatsoever he has said in his Word. Psalm. 28. 5. They
regard not the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands: therefore
break them down, and build them not up.

The Reasons of the Doctrine are two principally: first, every Christian, even
the best, had need to be further confirmed in his faith, and better assured
Reas. 1.
of the truth of Gods Word. Paul says of the Thessalonians, that there was
some thing lacking in their faith, 1 Thessalonians. 3. 10. How much more would we find
it so, specially if we should be brought to trial? yea that man certainly
has no faith, that feels no weakness of faith, nor need to grow. For not
only the man whose child had a dumb spirit, Mar. 9. 24. and the Apostles, Luke
17. 5. but even Paul (when he was at the best) professes with great
earnestness and care (to prevent in others that conceit of him) that he was
not perfect, but desired to grow in faith, Phil. 3. 12, 13.

Secondly, this course that the Ruler here took, this questioning and
inquiring, but specially this observing of the works of God, is a singular 2.
means to increase and confirm us in the faith, Psalm. 92. 4. Thou Lord (says
David) have made me glad by thy works, and I will rejoice in the works of thy
hands. For this experimental knowledge is the most certain of all other.
Psalm. 48. 8. As we have heard, so have we seen in the City of the Lord of
Hosts, in the City of our God, God will establish it for ever. Job 42. 5. I
have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye sees thee. See
in particular, how this observation of Gods work confirms our faith in the
truth. First, in the truth of Gods Word generally. Psalm. 119. 140. Thy Word is
proved most pure, and thy servant loves it. Secondly, in the truth of Gods
promises made to his people, see how the faithful are confirmed in them by the
experience of Gods dealing with other of his servants. Psalm. 22. 4. Our Fathers
trusted in thee, they trusted, and thou did deliver them: and 34. 5. They
shall look unto him, and run to him, and their faces shall not be ashamed.
Why? what should make them so confident in Gods mercies? verse. 6. This poor
man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. But
specially, the experience a man has had in himself, of the performance of
Gods promises, will maruellously confirm him. Romans 5 4. Experience brings
forth hope, in this case especially. See this in David, Psalm. 4. 1. Hear me
when I call, O God of my righteousness, thou have set me at liberty when I was
in distress, have mercy upon me, and hearken to my prayer. See this also in
Solomon, who have kept with thy servant David my father, that thou promisedst
him; thou spakest also with thy mouth, and have fulfilled it with thy hand, as
it is this day. Therefore now Lord God of Israel keep with thy servant David
my father, that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man
in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel -- And now o God of Israel let thy
word I pray thee be verified which thou spakest to thy servant David my father,
1. King. 8. ^4.-26. Another notable example we have for this in Jacob, Genesis 32.
9. Thou said unto me, remove into thy Country and to thy kindred, and I will
do thee good: there is Gods word and promise. Then follows the experience he
had already of the performance of this promise, verse 10. I am not worthy of
the least of all thy mercies which thou have showed unto thy servant, for with
my staff came I over this Jordan, and now have I gotten two bands. Then
follows the confirmation he received in his faith by this experience, verse.
11. I pray thee deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esan.
Thirdly and lastly, this is of great force to confirm our faith in the truth
of Gods threats against sin. Psalm. 58. 10. The righteous shall rejoice when he
sees the vengeance; and why so? verse. 11. and men shall say, verily there is a
reward for the righteous, doubtless there is a God that judges the earth.
Esa. 26 9. Seeing thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world
shall learn righteousness.

The Use of this Doctrine is twofold, according to the two branches of Use. 1.
the doctrine. It serves to exhort and persuade us all, that we would seek to
increase our knowledge and faith, by conferring, questioning, and reasoning
among our selves of the Word of God. This is a singular means ordained of God
to confirm us; by this we might learn much we know not, and this would help
our memory and affections: and we deprive our selves of a great benefit by the
neglect of it. See a Commandment of God for it, Ier. 23. 25. Thus shall ye
say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, what has the
Lord answered, and what has he spoken? There is a Commandment for one private
Christian, to question and reason with another of the Word of God: and Mal.
(...). 7. there is a Commandment for the people to move their doubts and
questions to the Minister, they shall seek the law at his mouth. See an
experiment of the fruit of it, Luke 24. in the Disciples that went to Emaus;
they conferred and moved their doubts one to another, verse. 14. and then verse.
15. It came to pass as they communed together, and reasoned, that Jesus
himself drew near, and went with them: and verse 27. he expounded in the
Scriptures unto them, and verse 45. he opened the understandings of all those
that were gathered together. Yea see the fruit even of that conference and
reasoning that a father shall use with his children, or a master with his
servants, or one neighbor with another, as they walk or ride together. Deuteronomy.
6. 7. Thou shall whet or sharpen them to thy children, when thou tarriest in
thy house, and when thou walk by the way. Christians when they have any
doubts in the matters of their faith and religion, should enquire and seek to
be resolved. Ier. 6. 16. They shall stand in the ways, and enquire for the old
way. When in reading or hearing of the Word they meet with doubts, they should
not lightly pass them over, but enquire; How is this to be understood, how may
this be proved? We have a notable example for this, of them that read the Word,
Act. 8. 34. I pray thee of whom speaks the Prophets this, of himself, or of
some other man? and for them that hear the Word, in the Disciples of our
Savior, who, whenever they had heard him teach ought that they did not
understand, were wont first to confer and reason among themselves about it,
and then if that would not serve, to go to their teacher. John 16. 17 -- 19.
Mar. 4. 10. and 7. 17. and 10. 10, 11. Christians should be asking of them that
are able to teach them the meaning, and reason of that they see done in the
administration of the Sacraments. Exodus 12. 26. It is said, that children
should ask their fathers concerning the Passover: What service is this you
keep? and Joshua 4. 6. What mean you by these stones? and Deuteronomy. 6. 20. What
mean these ordinances and testimonies and laws, which the Lord our God has
commanded you?

What is then the true cause why this duty is so much neglected; that
Christians when they meet, never confer or reason of good things: nay, when
they come in company with such as are able to teach them, they never move any
question of religion to them, but their talk is only of worldly and vain
things? Surely, it is because they have no doubts, no need to learn, or be
confirmed in the truth. And why have we no doubts, when the Eunuch and
Disciples had so many? Surely, our hearts are profane, and regard not what we
hear, or read, like those, Job 21. 14. who say to God, Depart from us: for we
desire not the knowledge of thy ways.

Now to conclude this Use, I will give you some few cautions and rules to
direct you in conferring and reasoning of Gods Word.

1. Your questions must be of such points as are profitable; not curious, of
such things as God has not revealed; or vain, of such things as you know no
use of, charge them not to give heed to fables, and endless genealogies which
minister questions, rather then edifying which is in faith 1. Tim. 1. 4.

2. You must move them with a desire and purpose to be resolved, and to yield
to the truth, when it is revealed unto you: not like Ahab, who enquired of many
of his Prophets whether he ought to go up to Ramoth Gilead, but was resolved
(...) and (say they what they list) what he wo^ do, 2. Chro. 18. 5. or the wom^
^ntioned, which will never be reso^ or settled, ever learning (...) ne^ able to
come to the knowledge of the tr^ (...) ^m. 3. 7. Of such Questionists it is
said, Mar. 8. 12. Christ sighed deeply in (...) ^t, and said, Why does this
generation seek a sign?

3. You must move questions, and talk of relig^ (...) great reverence, not
profanely, in a merry and jesting vain. 2. Tim. 2. (...) Stay profane and vain
bablings; for they increase unto more ungodliness.

4. Questions of religion must not be handled in ^on, in heat of contention,
as when men seek their own praise, and to get the victory one of another. The
Apostle, 1. Tim. 6. 4. condemns questions and strife of words, whereof comes
envy, strife, railing, and evil surmising.

The second Use of the Doctrine, is, to exhort us to use this means also for
the confirmation of our Faith, even the observing of Gods works, and the
experiments Use. 2.
we may therein find of the truth of his holy Word. It is good for us to this
end, to observe Gods dealing toward others. See what a notable use the Lord
says he knew Abraham would make of his judgment on Sodom, I know him that he
will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the
way of the Lord to do justice and judgment, Genesis 18. 19.

But specially it is good to observe, how God has made good and confirmed his
Word to thee, even in thine own experience. 1. His promises, by blessing thee,
while thou have walked carefully and conscionably before him; answering thy
prayers, etc. To this purpose belongs that exhortation, Psalm. 34. 8. O taste,
and see that the Lord is good* Labor to be able to say, as Psalm. 119. 56. This
I had, because I kept thy precepts: and verse 65. Thou have dealt well with thy
servant, according unto thy word. 2. His threats, by crossing and correcting
thee, when thou have swerued from his ways, that thou may also be able to
say, as Psalm. 119. 71. It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I
might learn thy statutes. 3. Generally, the truth of every part of his word,
that thou may, as Romans 12. 2. Prove what is that good, that acceptable, and
perfect will of God: and say of it from thine own experience, as Psalm. 19. 10.
that it is more to be desired than gold, ^ea, than much fine gold: sweeter also
than honey, and the honey comb. What man is there that might not often observe
some such experiments in himself? And how great is the benefit we might reap
by observing them?

FINIS.
