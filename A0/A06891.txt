To his assured good friend I. O. Stationer.
SIr, you having many times been in hand with me about a book entitled, The
Queen of Nauarres Tales; which (as you say) you have caused to be translated
out of French, at your proper charges, on mind to Print it, and you have
several times bin in hand with me to write you a Preface. You know I never
read the Book, and therefore I am not able to say what argument it holds,
nor otherwise what it concerns, which were behouefull to be known to him that
shall write a Preface: but the Title is enough to grace the Book, bearing the
name of the Queen of Nauarres Tales; whereby any man may conjecture that the
contents are some pithie Discourses, written for pleasure and recreation: and
so great a Princess vouchsafing so to honor them with her own name, who can
think but that the pleasure is contained within the limits both of wit and
modesty? For the curious conceited fellows that live now in the world, though
not possessed with any great store of malice nor wit, but are yet of such a fine
jesting humor, that they will dry-bob any man that writes, of what subject
soever. In stead of a Preface I will present them with a piece of an old
tale, a fiction, and fained, I know not by whom; but if the Author will not be
found, let me father it my self, the fable is this.

Nature having many years ago so wasted her treasures, in the perfiting of
woman's beauties, that by her former prodigality, her perfections are so
consumed and spent, that the women of this age are enforced to supply their
defects by periwigs and painting, by bombasting, and bolstering, and such other
artificial helps; the poor Lady (finding her own scarcity, not able to
perform that excellency, as before she had done in the feminine sex)
determined yet to make proof, and to try her cunning what she could do in the
masculine. Undertaking the task, with this settled curiosity, she proportioned
a man of such excellent perfection in all his limbs and lineaments, that Nature
herself began to wonder at her own work: and as the curious Artificer, who
thinks his labor to be but lost, that is still concealed and never brought to
sight, so Nature bringing forth this superexcellent personage to be viewed,
appointed him in such a place where the people of several Nations had their
continual recourse: the first that passed by was a Spaniard, who taking a full
survey of this new formed man, crossing himself, both his forehead and breast;
then throwing up his hands with admiration to the heavens, he said with a
loud voice; O most glorious and excelent creature in countenance, more amiable
and lovely than our lady of Loretta, in personage more comely than S. Iago of
Compostella: but how shall I extol thy praises? my comparisons are too weak;
I will therefore leave thee and bless Nature, who has blessed her self in
featuring of thee. Nature that stood fast by, where she might both hear and
see, and yet unseen her self, was well pleased with this first salutation, and
the Spaniard thus departed. The next that came by was an Italian, and he (as
the Spaniard before, but with alitle more circumspection) taking the view of
this goodly creature, fell first into a fit of wondering; from that, into an
ecstasy of praising, then to protesting, that for a thousand ducats he would
not have his wife to have a sight of this temtation: and now he fell to
swearing, that to prevent all perils, he would keep her still locked up in a
chamber; and thus he went his way. With this Nature smiled to see the
passionate demeanor of the jealous headed Italian. And let it suffice that I
deliver (though not in this particular sort) how the people of sundry other
Nations as they passed by, what praises and commendations they would all of
them attribute to this handiworke of Nature, imputing it to be without fault,
blemish, imperfection, or any manner of defect: till at the last there fortuned
to come by an Englishman, I think some of the same traveling fellows whereof
there are some, that running through the world to seek new fashions abroad,
do lose al their wits that they carried with them from home; or perhaps it
might be some worthy soldier, that if he has but discharged a case of
pifle-pots out of a Gentleman's chamber, seen an Ensign three times spread in
the field, puts himself by and by into the arming doublet, the points with
the great silver tagges, tied in the pitch of the shoulder: then at every word
he must be caled Mas Captain: then if he have but learned thus much of the new
Discipline, as to say, Double your Ranks on the right hand, now again as you
were, double your Files on the left hand, close your Ranks, open your Files:
why so, this is enough to make him able to coosin an hundred and fifty
soldiers of their pay. Now for table-talke you shall hear nothing out of their
mouths, but of the scaling of forts, the assaulting of breaches, the taking of
citidales, and by their words they will seem to undertake the winning of a
greater town than Lysbourne, but with discharging two or three volies of oths.
To conclude, when they are angry, there is nothing in their mouths but the
stab; and when they are pleased, their greatest friendship is not worth an
ordinary of eighteen pence. I speak not to prejudice any gentleman that has
traveled for his own experience, whereof there be many worthy of
commendations, nor to disgrace any soldier that is of desert, whereof there
are none but are worthy of honor: but I speak of those counterfeit
Companions, that under these titles and pretenses do countenance themselves,
taking authority to slander, jest, scoff, and find fault at any thing. One of
these privileged people now passing along the street, his gesture so governed
as if he carried a whole com mon wealth in his head, his eyes so fixed as if he
were in the meditation of his mistress, his countenance so graced, as a man
might see a dicker of fools in his face, his salutation to such as passed by
was a nod with his head, and his hand clapped over his lips, which they do call
the Bassiles manus, his speeches compendious and short, nothing but sentences:
this finicall fellow being now come to the place where Nature was yet abiding,
rejoicing to hear herself so glorified for this excelencie of her work, he
began as the rest had done, to survey every part, every proportion and
lineament, from the top to the toe, he went about him, and round about him,
behind, and before, prying, and beholding with more curiosity than any of the
rest had done before him, and when he had looked til he was weary, said never a
word, but shaking a little his head was going away, till nature seeing this
strange demeanor called him back, and in courteous sort demanded of him how he
liked of the object, that he had so advisedly perused: to the which he
answered; In faith it is not to be misliked, it is a very goodly presence,
hansome, comely, God had done his part, and he saw nothing but the man was well
enough. But I pray said Nature again, what is it that you mislike? I perceive
by your speeches there is something amiss, and therefore tell me what it is
that you do think might be amended. Gentlewoman (said he) seeing you press
me so far, I will deal plainly with you; the fault that I find is this, It
is pity that he is not an English man borne, but if he had been an English
man borne, I could then have commended these perfections, which I will now
forbear. And it is pity (said Nature) that thou art an Englishman borne; for
if thou were not an Englishman borne, I would so display thy imperfections,
which in regard of that renowned Nation now I will omit. This poor pedant
meeting with such a counter-buffe, thought it not good to fall a scolding with
a Gentlewoman, but caling her cursed queen, went his way scratching of his
head. And here an end of an old tale.

Now M. Oxenbridge I will direct my text again to your private self, how shall
you and I escape the gentle frump from these same perilous conceited fellows,
that will not omit to find a fault at any thing, nor will not forbear to
break a jest upon any man? mary I Will tell you how we will stop their mouths if
we can, we will give them the fool aforehand: I do not mean to any friendly
Reader, that will sooner wink at a fault, than find a fault, but to these
mungrell curres, that although they cannot bite, will yet stand aloof and
bark. And this Misacmos in his Apology of Ajax says is a figure, and he
calls it Prolepsis or Prevention. Now if we by giving the fool aforehand,
could prevent them that they should not snarle at us, twere a pretty trick. And
why not? For now I remember me, I knew the practice of it long before I knew
Misacmos, and learned it of a Gentlewoman that had borne a bastard before she
was married, who for prevention sake would call whore first, and would raise
slanderous reports of every other woman, how honest soever, because she would
brand them all with her own mark. Call you this a Figure? No sir, it was wit,
and I warrant you it proceeded from a very quick conceit: as how? Mary she
would not venture upon a husband, til she had made trial how she was able to
endure the bearing of a child: for Omnia probata wittrieth all things. Sir, I
do commend her for her wit; but by your leave, if my wife were but half so
wise, I would think that a Carte were fitter for her than a Coach.

Well, I thank you Misacmos, we have made a little bold with your Figure, and I
hope without offense; and I see prevention is very good, but I like not of his
prevention, that being a known cuckold himself, and to prevent ill language,
would hang horns in the night at his neighbors door: Like to a cunning
fellow that I know, I will not say a Conie-catcher, but a scaulled squire
named Will Cogge, a trencher scraping cullion but this other day, who in less
then a years cogging (being skillful in that faculty) has got more, then
now by his trade heel get these seven years. This Canniball (I say) in the
night would hang up horns at his neighbors doors, that they might seem as
shameful to the world, as he shameless: and now associating himself with
one, a jolly fellow, who though he seem to the view of the world (by the
carriage of his body) a well accomplished K: at arms, yet otherwise, but a
paultry shifting wenching companion, when a man has made the best of him; who
because he might not have the maidenhead of his neighbors wise the first
night, but Jack Drummers entertainment, after he had shamefully demanded it,
runs up and down (threatening highly) in his hose and dublet like a
masterlesse man, with his collar turned down round about his neck, making way
for the halter, as one that were going to be hanged, to mince them as small as
flesh to the pot. Well, birds of a feather will hang together; these two,
knaves I found them, and knaves I leave them, and that is all the reckoning I
make of them. Well, let them winch that are rubbed on the gall, but if they
kick, I will stand aloof and cry, guppe old Jade are you coltish? And when
I have a little laughed, I will lean my self to this old axiom, Qui moccat
moccabitur; the which in our mother tongue may thus be interpreted, she is a
sorry Lady that has never a Ioynter. Thus M. Oxenbridge, if you shall accept
of these lines thus hastily hatched, I hope the courteous Reader will not be
offended, and for the malicious I care not. Thus with my commendations to your
self I end.

Your assured friend, A. B.

The Queen of Nauarres Tales.
The first Novel.
Of a woman of Alancon that had two friends, one for pleasure, the other for
profit, which caused one of them to be killed that first perceived her deceit,
for the which she obtained a pardon both for her self and her husband that
was fled, who after that to save a piece of money wherein he was condemned,
sought counsel of a Coniurer; but his enterprice being discovered, they were
both punished.

IN the Town of Alancon, in the time of Duke Charles that last deceased, there
dwelt an Attorney that had married a gentlewoman of that country, more fair
than honest; who by reason of her beauty, together with her lightness, was
greatly sought unto by a religious man, whose name I will conceal, for the
reverence of their state, who to attain to his desire, entertained her husband
so well, and used him so friendly, that being blinded with simplicity, could
not perceive the lewdnes of his wife: but which is more, caused him to forget
the affection that he always had to the service of his master and mistress, in
such sort, that of a faithful servant, he became so contrary, that in fine he
sought by Coniurations to bring the Duchess to her end. This priest lived
long time, in that manner with this wicked woman, which obeyed him more for
desire of money than for love, as also that her husband ceased not to incite
her thereunto. But there was a young man in the said town of Alancon, son to
the lieutenant general, whom she loved with so great affection, that for his
love she was in a manner half beside her wits. Wherein ofttimes she holp
herself by the priests means, by sending her husband forth, whereby he
being busied, she might with better leisure visit the lieutenants son. This
manner of behavior continued so long time, that for her profit she entained
the priest, and for her pleasure received the other, unto whom she swear that
all the entertainment she gave unto the priest was only by that means freely to
use his company, and that whatsoever passed between them yet she said the
priest had obtained naught of her but words, and that he might be well assured,
that never any man but himself should reap other pleasure at her hands. Upon
a day as her husband went to see the priest, she asked him leave to go into
the country, saying that the air of the city was somewhat contagious for
her: and being at her country house, she wrote unto the lieuetenants son that
he should not fail about ten of the clock at night to come unto her, which
he failed not to do: but at the door he found the maid that used to let him
in, who spoke unto him and said; Friend, you must now go walk some other way,
for your place is taken up. He thinking her husband had bin come, asked her
the cause: wherewith the poor maid pitying his estate, and perceiving him to
be so fair, and honest a young man, and one that loved so well, and so little
beloved again, opened her mistress folly unto him, thinking that when he
understood thereof, he would blame himself for loving so constantly. She
told him that the priest was but newly come thither, and gone to bed to her
mistress, whom at that time she looked not for, in that she had not appointed
him to come before the next day; but he having busied her husband about his
affairs, was secretly come that night to visit her. If any man ever
dispaired, assure your selves it was the lieutenants son, who for that time
would scant believe it, But to try the truth, he stayed at a house hard by
till he saw the priest come forth, not so well disguised but that he knew him
better than he would. In which despair he went to Alanson, whicher, not long
time after, his counterfeit friend returned, who thinking to abuse him, as she
had often done, went to speak with him: but he said she was too holy
(having touched consecrated things) to speak with him being so miserable a
sinner as he was, whose repentance was so great that he hoped it could soon
be pardoned. When she perceived her wanton life discovered, and that neither
excuse, oathe, nor promise never to do it again would aught prevail, she made
complaint unto the Priest. And having consulted with him, went and told her
husband, that she could no longer stay in Alanson, because the lieutenants
son whom she accounted for her friend* sought continually to dishonor her;
whereupon she desired him to give her leave to stay at Argenton, thereby to
cease suspicion: her husband that suffered himself to be ruled by her, yielded
to her request. They were not long at Argenton, but this wicked woman sent
word unto the lieutenants son, that she thought him the wickedest man at
that time living on earth, and that she had heard that he ceased not openly
to speak evil of her and of the priest, for the which she swore she would be
revenged. The young man that never had spoken thereof but to her self, and that
feared the priests displeasure, with two of his servants went strait unto
Argenton, and found the woman in the Iacobins Church at evening prayer, where
he went and kneeled down hard by her, and said unto her: Gentlewoman, I am
come hither to protest unto you by the living God, that I never spoke to any
man of you to your dishonor, but only to your self, and yet you have committed
so heinous an offense in my behalf, as I have not used half so many injurious
speeches in your behalf as you deserve, for if either man or woman will affirm
that ever they heard it from my mouth, I am come hither before your face to
prove them liers. She perceiving many people to be in the church, and that he
was accompanied with two lusty seruingmen, spoke as softly as she could saying
unto him, she doubted not but he said the truth, and that she counted him too
honest to speak evil of any woman in the world, specially of her, being one
that loved him well, but she said her husband had some inkling thereof,
wherefore she desired him that he would clear himself before him, whereby he
might be thoroughly persuaded of her honesty, which he agreed unto; and
thinking to bring her home, took her by the arm: but she told him it was not
good for him to go with her, for if he should, her husband would conceive that
she had caused him to come. And therewith taking one of his men by the cloak,
she said unto him, let your man go with me, and when time serves, I will send
him to fetch you, mean time go you unto your lodging: he not fearing her
conspiracy, went thither, and she being at home made his man that went with
her to stay to supper, who demanded of her oftentimes when he should fetch his
master: she answered he would come time enough. When midnight came, she sent
one of her servants secretly to fetch him, who nothing doubting her pretended
mischief, went boldly to saint Aignans house, where the gentlewoman stayed his
servant, whereby he had but one with him. And when he was at the door, her
servant told him, that his mistress would feign speak with him before her
husband, and that she stayed for him in a chamber, only with his own servant,
saying he should do well to send his other home, which he presently did: and
going up a pair of darke-staires, the Attorney that had set men to watch in a
chamber hard by, hearing the noise of his feet, asked who went there? and it
was told him it was a man that would secretly come into his house. With that
one Thomas Guerin a common murderer, and by the Attorney hired for the
purpose, struck so many blows with his sword at the poor young man, that
what defense soever he made, he could not save his life, but was presently
slain. His man that in the mean time was talking with the Gentlewoman, said
unto her, I think I heard my master on the stairs, I will go see. But she
made him stay and said; take you no care he will come soon enough. But not long
after hearing his master say, alas, I am dead, Lord receive my soul, he said
he would go help him: yet she still held him saying, doubt not, it is nothing
but that my husband has taught him how to leave his youthful tricks: let us go
see; and looking down from the stairs head, asked her husband what the matter
was, saying, what have you done? who replied, come down and see. Now have I
revenged you of him that lought you so much shame, and saying so, with a
poinyard that he had, thrust ten or twelve blows into his belly being dead,
that living he durst not assaise. After the murder done, and that the dead
Gentleman's servants were both fled, to certify his father: the said Aignan
knowing it could not be concealed, and that the Gentleman's servants could not
be allowed as witnesses in law, and that not: any man in the house had seen
it done, but only the murderers, an old maid, and a young wench of fifteen
years old, thought secretly to take the old maid, but she found means to
escape away, and fled into the Iacobins church, being the surest witness to
prove the murder. The wench for a time stayed within the house; but he found
such means, that one of the murderers enticed her, and he falling in love
with her led her to Paris, and there kept her in the common stews, by the
which means she was not a lawful witness. And the better to hide the murder,
he caused the dead body to be burnt, and the bones that were not consumed, to
be put into a mortar and stamped to powder: sending in all haste unto the
Court, to ask a pardon, giving it to understand, that he had oftentimes
forbidden his house to a certain young man, whom he suspected in his wifes
behalf, who notwithstanding was come thither by night, secretly to speak with
her, and finding him at her chamber door, more filled with rage than reason,
had slain him. But he could not so soon dispatch his letter to the
chancellor, but the Duke and the Duchess by the father of the dead man were
certified thereof, who to stay his pardon, wrote letters to the contrary.
Whereupon the unhappy wretch perceiving he could by no means obtain it, fled
with his wife, and diverse of his kindred into England: but before his departure
he said unto the murderer, (who at his request had done the deed) that he had
received express letters from the King to take him, and cause him to be
hanged: but in respect of the service he had done, he said he was content to
save his life, and therewith gave him ten crowns to fly out of the realm.
Which he presently did, and never was seen again. But the murder was so well
proved and justified, not only by the servants of the dead man, but by the
maid that saues her self in the Iacobins church, as also by the bones found
within the mortar, that in the absence of the said S. Aignan and his wife, the
process was made and sued against them, whereby they were both condemned by
default, and judged to be hanged, their goods confiseate to the prince, and
1500. crowns given to the father of the dead man, for the charge of the suit.
Mean time the said S. Aignan being in England, and seeing that by course of
law he was condemned in France, did so much by his service unto diverse
Noblemen, as also by the means of his wives kinsmen, that the King of England
wrote unto the king to grant him pardon, and to restore him to his goods and
credit again. But the king having understood the heinousness of the fact,
sent the copy of the process unto the king of England, desiring him to look
into it, and to consider whether such a fact deserved pardon; certifying him
likewise, that the duke of Alancon only had that privilege within his realm,
to grant pardons for all faults committed within his Duchy. Al these excuses
notwithstanding, the king of England did not content himself, but wrote so
earnestly therein, that in fine at his request, the Attorney obtained his
pardon, and thereby returned into France. But being at home, the better to
accomplish his iniquities, he acquainted himself with a certain coniurer
named Gallery, hoping by his means and devilish art, to be exempted from
paying the said fifteen hundred crowns to the dead man's father. Which to
effect, he and his wife went disguised unto Paris, where his wife perceiving
her husband with the said Gallery to be so long time shut up into a chamber,
and made not her acquainted with the cause, one morning she watched them, and
saw. Gallery show her husband five Images of wood, whereof three had their
hands hanging down, and two held up their hands, and speaking unto him said,
we must make the like Images in wax, and they that have their arms hanging
down, shall be the Images of such persons as we mean to consume to death, but
those that hold them up, shall be for those of whom we mean to win the favor.
Then the Attorney said, this shall be for the king, of whom I will be loved,
and this for Monsieur Brinon Chancellor of Alancon. Gallery said, you must set
the Images under the alter where mass is usually said, with certain words,
which as then (said he) I will cause you to pronounce: and speaking of the
images that held their arms down, the Attorney said, that one of them was
for Master Giles de Mesuil the dead man's father, as knowing well, that as long
as he lived, he would never leave the suit, and one of the images, made for
women that had the arms hanging down shall be (said he) for my Lady the
Duchess of Alanson the kings sister, because she loved her old servant Don
Mesuil so well, and to the contrary, knew so much of the atturneys villainy, that
if she died not he could not live: and the second image of a woman having the
arms downward, he said was for his wife, as being cause of all his
mischief, being well assured, she never would amend her life. When his wife
that saw all this through the key hole of the door, and understood he placed
her among the dead, thought it better to send him thither first: so that making
as though she went to borrow money of her uncle, being master of Requests
unto the duke, showed him what she had heard and seen her husband do. Her
uncle like a trusty old seruitor to the duke went unto the Chancellor of
Alancon* aduertising him thereof: and because the Duke and the Duchess of
Alancon were not on that day at the Court, the Chancellor went and told it to
the lady Regent the queen mother, and likewise to the Duchess, who presently
sent for the provost of Paris called La-Barre, who made such haste, that he
took the attorney and Gallery his Coniurer, who without (...) or any
con^^raine confessed their fault. Whereupon their process being made, was
carried to the King, to whom (some of the Court desirous to save their lives)
said in their behalf, that by their inchantme^ts, they sought but only to
(...) his favor, and not to destroy him* But the king having his sisters life
as dear as his own; commanded that judgment should be given in as strict a
manner as if they had practiced his own death. Nevertheless the Duchess of
Alanson his sister, besought him to save the Attunies life, and to change his
death into some hard and grievous corporal pain; which was granted her, so
that he and Gallery were sent to Marseills, there to row in the galli^s of
Saint Blanquart, where in they ended their days in great captivity; and
thereby had means to confess and acknowledge the greatness of then sins:
and the wicked woman in the absence of her husband continued in her wickedne^
more than ever she did before, (...) ^ie^ miserably*

The second Nouel.
The pitiful and chaste death of the wife of one of the Multiers of the Queen
or Navarre.

THere dwelt in the town of Ambois a multier that served the Queen of
Navarre* sister to Frauncis the French king, whose wife lay in childbed of a
son within the City of Blois; whither the s^id^ multier (...) receive his
quarters wages, leaving his wife at Ambois, lodging beyond the bridges: now he
had a servant that of long time had so desperately loved his wife, that upon a
certain day he could not choose but (...) i^ unto her: bu^ she b^ing an
honest woman, took it (...) that (...) reproved him, but threatened to cause
her husband to beat him, whereby hemener after durst venture to speak unto
her, or once show any countenance thereof, keeping it secret in his heart
until such time his master was gone abroad, and his mistress in S. Florontines
(a church belonging to the castle, and standing far from thence) at evening
prayer. And he being at home without company, it came in his mind to seek
that by force and violence, which by prayer and service he could never obtain,
and to that end brake a planke out of the wall, between the chamber of his
mistress, and that where he lay, which, because the side of the head, as well of
his master and mistress, as of the servants on the other side stood close
unto the wall, could not be perceived, whereby his wicked pretense could never
be espied, till upon a time, she being in bed with a young wench of eleven or
twelve years old, and in her first sleep, this villain in his shirt entered
through the said hole into the chamber with his naked sword in his hand: but
as soon as she felt him by her, she quickly sprang out of the bed, dissuading
him by all means and exhortations, that possibly an honest woman could devise;
but he that had naught but heastly love, and better understood in the Mules
language, than her honest reasons, showed himself beastilier than those beasts
with whom he had long continued: for perceiving that she ran so fast about
a table that he could not have his will, as also that she was so strong, that
she had twice loosed her self out of his hands, being in despair never to
have his pleasure while she lived, gave her a great blow upon the reins,
thinking, that if neither fear nor force could make her yield, yet pain
would do it: but he found the contrary, for that even as a good soldier,
perceiving his blood, is thereby more moved to revenge himself, and win his
honor, so her chaste heart enforced her much more to run and fly out of the
villains hands, always giving him the fairest words she could, thinking by
such means to make him know his fault: but to the contrary he was so furious,
that by no means he would be ruled by her good counsel, giving her diverse other
blows, which to avoid, she never ceased to run, as long as her legs would
hold. But in the end, when with the loss of so much blood she felt her death
approach, listing her eyes to heaven, and holding up her hands, she yielded
thanks to God, whom she named her force, her virtue, her patience, and her
chastity, beseeching him to accept that blood (which to obey his
commandment) she then had shead in reverence of Christ Jesus his son,
whereby she steadfastly believed all her sins to be forgiven, and saying, Lord
receive the soul that by thy mercy has freely been redeemed, she fell with
her face upon the ground; and being fallen, the wicked villain gave her diverse
blows; wherewith having lost her speech, and strength of body failing, the
villain took by force that which she for want of strength could not defend.
And having satisfied his filthy lust, fled so hastily, that never after (what
means soever was wrought) he could be found. Mean time the young wench that
lay with the Multiers wife, with fear crept under the bed: but perceiving the
man to be gone, came out, and finding her mistress to be without either speech
or feeling, she cried at the window to the neighbors round about for helps,
whereat such as loved and liked her well came presently unto her, bringing
Surgeons with them, and found she had received five and twenty deadly wounds
upon her body, which, as much as in them lay they sought to heal; but all in
vain: nevertheless, she languished without speech in that sort for the space
of one whole hour, moved her hands, and eyes, whereby she showed not to have
lost her memory; and being by a priest examined of her faith, she made
thereof such evident signs, as that by word of mouth she could not have done
better, showing that her trust was in the death of Jesus Christ, whom she hoped
shortly to behold within his heavenly seat: and so with a cheerful
countenance, her eyes looking up to heaven, she yielded her chaste body unto
the earth, and her soul unto the Lord: and being taken up, and her body wownd
and set before the door, staying for company to bring her to her grave, her
husband chanced to come home, where he espied his dead wife standing at the
door before he knew thereof: and having inquired of the cause, had double
reason to be grieved thereat, whereby he fell so sick, that hardly he escaped
death. In this manner that martire of chastity was buried in saint Florentines
Church, whither all the honest wives within the town failed not to bear her
company, accounting themselves most happy to be of such a town where so
virtuous a woman was found: and therewith those that were not so wise, but
lighter of behavior, seeing the honor done unto that body, determined from
that time forwards to change their wicked lives.

The third Novel.
A King of Naples abusing a Gentleman's wife, in the end ware horns himself.

BEcause Gentlewomen (said Saffredant) I have often wished my self to be
companion in the fortune of him, whereof I mean to speak, I will show you
that in the city of Naples in the time of king Alphonsus, whose lascivious
life was his Scepter, there was a Gentleman so honest, fair and courteous, that
by reason of his perfections an old Gentleman gave him his daughter in
marriage, that for beauty and good grace was nothing inferior to him, who
loved well together, until Shrouetide after, that the King in masking went
from house to house to sport himself, wherein each man enforced themselves,
to honor him as they could: and when he came to the Gentleman's house, he was
received and entertained much better than elsewhere, as well with banquets, as
with music, and the fairest wife (in his mind) that ever he had seen, who
after the banquet was done, she and her husband sang a song with so good
grace, that it increased her beuty: wherewith the king perceiving two
perfections in one body, took not so much delight in their pleasant voices, as
in devising how to break thaccord: but the difficulty he found, was, the
great and perfect love he saw to be in them, which made him hear that: passion
in his mind as covertly as he could: but to ^ase himself, he caused certain
banquets to be made, for all the Ladies and Gentlewomen within the City of
Naples, where the Gentleman and his wife were not forgotten. And because a man
is easily induced to believe whatsoever he sees, it seemed the Gentlewomans
eyes promised him some good fortune, if the husbands presence were no
hinderance thereunto: and to prove it, he sent her husband for 15. days or
three weeks on message unto Rome: who was no sooner gone, but his wife that
never had bin so long without his company, made exceeding sorrow: but being in
his absence often visited by the king, as time and leisure served, both with
fair speeches, presents, and with gifts, she was not only comforted, but well
content her husband should stay longer: and before the three weeks ended,
wherein he should return, she waxed so amorous of the king, that she was as
much grieved at his coming again, as she had been sorrowefull for his going.
And not to loose the presence of the king, they agreed, that when her husband
went into the country, she would make it known to him, who thereby might
assuredly come to her, and so secretly, that the man whom she feared more than
her own conscience, should not he burt: in hope whereof this Gentlewoman was
joyful, so that at her husbands return she seemed very glad, who although he
heard that in his absence, the king had often visited his wife, yet he
suspected no ill, but in process of time, that ^^re so hardly to be covered,
began by little and little to show, in such manner, that the husband in thend
doubted some deceit, keeping so good watch, that he was thereof assured: but by
reason of the fear he had of him, that did him injury, he made no show thereof,
determining to dissemble, as desiring rather to live in secret grief than once
to hazard his life for a women that had no love in her. Nevertheless, in that
despite he thought to yield the like unto the king, if possibly he might:
and knowing that oftentimes despite: makes women do more than love,
specially such as have great hearts, and honorable minds, he being in the
queens presence was so bold to say unto her, that it pitied him to see her
not so well beloved of the King as she deserved. Whereunto the Queen that
knew the love the king bare to his wife, answered him, and said, I cannot both
have honor and pleasure at one time, I know I have the honor, but another
reapeth the pleasure, and she that has my pleasure yet has she not my honor.
He that perceived full well why she uttered that speech, answered her and said:
Madam, your honor proceeds from birth, as being so nobly born, that any
degree cannot augment your glory, but your highness beutie, grace, and
honesty, has deserved so much pleasure, that she which takes that from you
that is your due, does her self more wrong than you, for that for a certain
glory, which turns to shame, she loses as much pleasure as you or any
Gentlewoman in this land can have. An^ (...) much Madam I will tell you, that if
the king would lay his ^^owne aside, I think he should have small advantage at
my hands to please a woman, being well assured hereof, that to conte^^ so
honest a person as your self, it would be better for him that (...) were of my
complexion. The queen laughing answered him and said, although the king my
husband be of more de^icate complexion than your self; yet it is the love he
be^^^th m^^ contenteth me so well, that I prefer the sa^^ before all other
things. The Gentleman replied and said: (...), if it were so, you would not
pity me, for hereof am I assured, that the honest love which rests in your
heart would (...) you more conten^ment, if it found the like within the king;
but God has well provided otherwise, to them that you not finding that in him
which you desire, you should not use him for your God on earth. I assure you,
said the Queen, the love I bear him is so great, that in no woman^ heart but
mine the lik^ is to be found. Pardon me Mada^* (said the Gentleman) you have
not yet well tried the love of all men's hearts: for this I dare well say, there
is one that loves you, whose love is so importable, that yours in his respect
is not to be compared; and for that he sees the kings love much quenched
toward you, his does so much in crease, that if you like thereof, you shall be
satisfied for all your losses past. The Queen therewith began as well by
outward gesture, as by words, to find his speech proceeded from his heart:
and calling to mind, that of long time her sought to do her service, with such
affection, that he wholly seemed melancholy, which she esteemed because of
his bad wife, but as then the steadfastly believed it was for the love of her,
as also the virtue of love, which makes it self felt not being done, assured
her of that which no man else could tell: And beholding the Gentleman to be of
greater beauty than the king, perceiving him also clean cast off by his wife,
as she was of the king, being urged with despite and jealousy of her husband,
and moved with the love of the Gentleman, with tears ready to drop out of
her eyes, sighing she spoke and said, O God! must revenge of wrong work that
in me, which love could never do: Which the Gentleman hearing, answered her and
said: Madam the revenge is easy to him, that in place of killing his enemy
gives life to a perfect friend: me thinks it is time that truth should take
from you the foolish love you bear to him that loves you not again; and that
the just and reasonable love should drive that fear out of your mind, which
never can remain within a virtuous heart. Now Madam, let us lay aside the
greatness of your state, and consider our selves to be the man and wife in
this world, most mocked and betrayed of those we dearly loved: let us revenge
our selves (good Madam) not so much to give them their desert, as to satisfy
the love which on my behalf can no longer be forborue, unless it cost me my
life: and this I think if your heart be not hardened more than a Diamond, it is
impossible you should not feel some spark of fire which increases so much
more, as I seek to cover it, if pity of me, which for your love still die,
cannot move you to love me, at least, the love of your own self should
constrain you thereunto, who being so perfect, deserve the hearts of all the
honest Gentlemen in the world: being despised and forsaken of him, for whom
you have disdained all the rest.

The queen hearing these words was therewith in such a transe, that fearing
once by countenance to show her troubled mind, and leaning on the Gentleman's
arm, went into a Garden adjoining to her chamber, where she walked long
before that she could utter any word, but the gentleman perceauing her to be
half won, being at the Allies end where no man could discover what they did,
showed her by effect the love he had so long conceald from her, and finding
themselves to be of one consent they took revenge in that, whereof the passion
seemed intolerable, and there* they did agree, that as often as he went into
the Country, and the King into the Town, he would not fail to come unto the
Castle to see the Queen, and in that manner deceiving the deceivers, they
should be four participants of that pleasure which two alone thought only to
inioye: this agreement made, the gentleman returned home, and the Queen into
her Chamber, with such contented minds, that all their former grief was
clean consumed, and the fear that each of them might have of the Kings
repair unto the gentlwoman, was wholly turned to desire, which caused the
gentleman oftener to go (then he had used) to his country house, being but
half a mile from thence. Which the King no sooner knew, but he went to see the
gentlewoman: and the gentlman when night came went likewise to the Queen, as
lieuetenant to the King so secretly, as it never could be spied: which life
continued long, notwithstanding the King, being no common person, could not so
well dissemble his love, but that the world perceived it full well, whereby all
honest men took pity of the gentleman's estate in that some bad companions
refrained not to mock and scorn him, which he perceived well, where with he
was so well content, that he esteemed his horns as much as the king esteemed
his crown. Who on a time being with the Gentleman, could not refrain (seeing
a hearts head nailed up in the Gentleman's house) to smile before him, saying
that such a head became the house full well. But the gentleman in courage not
inferior to the King, wrote over the head, saying, I bear these horns as
every one may see, but some do bear them that believe it not. And when the
king came thither again, and found the same writing there, he asked the
gentleman the meaning thereof, who made him answer: if the kings secret be
hidden from the heart, it is no reason why the hearts should be declared to the
king: but comtent your self (my Lord) said he, that all those which bear
horns go not bare head, for that they are thought, that they uncover no man,
and he bears them lightest, that thinks he has none. The king knew well by
th^se words that somewhat was discovered, yet never suspected the love between
the queen and him: for that the more the queen contented her self with the
kings behauior, so much the more she seemed discontent, whereby long time they
lived in that sort, on all parts, until by age they were constrained to leave.

The fourth Novel.
The rash enterprise of a Gentleman toward a Princess of Flaunders, with the
shame and discredit he reaped thereby.

THere dwelt in the country of Flaunders a Lady of such state as better there
could not be; a widow of two husbands, by whom she had no children, whereby
during her widowhoode she continued in her brothers house, of whom she was
well beloved, he being a great Lord and husband to a kings daughter. This young
prince was much given unto his pleasure, loving hunting pastimes, and company
of Ladies, as youth requires, having a wife so troublesome and melancholy,
that her husbands pleasures were no delight to her at al: wherefore the said
Lord still desired his sisters presence, being a pleasant Gentlewoman, and the
best companion that might be found, yet very wise and of great honesty. There
was in this great Lords house a Gentleman, whose port, beauty, and good
behauior surpassed all the rest of his companions. This gentleman perceiving his
Masters sister to be a Gentlewoman addicted unto mirth, and always pleasant,
thought to assay, if moving her with the choice of an honest friend would not
offend her: which he did, but found contrary answer to her outward show: and
though her answer was such as became an honest woman, and so great a Princess,
yet perceiving him to be so fair, and courteous withal, she easily forgave
his bold attempt, showing by outward countenance not to be displeased with him,
in speaking unto her; telling him nevertheless, that her desire was not that
he should move her any more therein: which he promised to observe, thereby
not to loose the honor and contentment he received in dark speaking to her.
Nevertheless in time his affection so much increased, that he clean forgot
his former promise, not that he sought to hazard it by words (as having
overmuch, and sore against his will tried her wise denial) but thinking if he
could find her in some place convenient, that she being a widow, young, lusty,
and of good complexion, would possibly take pity of them both. Which to
effect, he said unto his master, that not far from his house, he should find
good store of game, and that if it pleased him to go thither to hunt three or
four stags, in the month of May, he should not find so pleasant sport
elsewhere. Which the Lord, as well for the love he bare unto the Gentleman, as
for the pleasure he usually took in hunting, agreed unto: going unto his house,
which he found, not only fair, but excellently furnished, as any Gentleman's
within that country, where he lodged the lord and his lady in one chamber, and
in an other chamber right over against that he placed her whom he loved
better than himself. The chamber being so well hanged with arras, both round
about and over head, and so well matted, that it was impossible once to
perceive a trap door, under her bed that went down into the chamber where his
mother lay, being an old Gentlewoman, and somewhat lame, who by reason of her
cough, fearing to disease the Princess that lay in the chamber over her,
changed chambers with her son: and every night after supper this old
Gentlewoman brought comfets into the Princes chamber, whereat the Gentleman was
assistant, who being well-beloved, and secret with her brother, was not excluded
from her when she ^^de her ready, or when she went to bed, where still he
found occasion to augment his love, in such manner, that one night after he
had kept the Princess waking so long time, that she being sleepie, caused him
to retire, he went into his chamber: and having put on his brauest and best
perfumd shirt he had, with a night coife suitable thereto, it seemed unto him
(in looking on himself) that not any Lady in the world could find in her
heart to refuse his love: wherefore persuading with himself a happy success,
he went to bed, wherein he lay not long, by reason of the great desire and hope
he had to obtain a far more honorable success* and having sent his servants
forth, he rose to shut the door, listening if he could hear any stirring in
the princes chamber; and being well assured that every man was at rest, meant
to bring his long desired travail to effect, by little and little letting
down the trap, which being so well trimmed and lined with cloth, made not any
noise: which being done, by the same way went into the ^^inces chamber, and to
her bed (who as then began to sleep) not once remembering the promise made
unto her, neither yet respecting her high parentage, where without reverence or
once asking leave he lay down by her, who sooner felt her self between his
arms, then once perceived his coming. But she being strong, unloosed her
self, and asking what he was, began in such sort to strike, bite, and scratch,
that for the fear he had she should cry out he was constrained to cover her
mouth, which nevertheless he could not do, so that when she perceived he
spared not all means to force her to his will, she spared not again to keep
him from it, calling her waiting gentlewoman as loud as possible she could,
that slept within her chamber, and an old and virtuous lady as any could be
found who in her smock came strait unto her mistress. But when the gentleman
perceived himself discovered, he was in so great fear to be known unto the
lady, that in as great haste as he could he got down by the trap, and so with
as much desire and hope as before he had to be received, with much more fear
and deep despair he was glad to go away; and taking his glass in hand,
having a candle upon the table, he beheld his face by her all bloody,
scratched, and bitten, whereby the blood ran down upon his shirt, in such
manner, that it appeared more bloody than wrought with gold. Wherewith he said:
O beuty, thou now have won thy just reward, for by thy vain promise, I have
enterprised a thing impossible, which in lieu of increasing my desire, may be a
strong redoubling of my grief: being well assured, that if she once do
perceive that contrary to my promise I have enterprised this folly, I shall not
only leese my honesty, but the daily frequentation with her, that more than
others. I usually have hade that which my glory, beuty, and good grace has well
deserved, I ought not once to cover; but to obtain her love, I should not so
have ventured, to force her chaste and princely body, but rather by true
service, and humble patience attend the time when love might be victorious,
because that without it all the virtues, and forces of man can naught avail. In
which sort he passed the night in tears, sighs and griefs impossible to
rehearse: and in the morning perceiving his face al mangled, he fained to be
sick, and not able to endure the light til all the company was gone. The Lady
that had won the victory, knowing, that not any man in her brothers house,
durst once attempt so bad an enterprise, but only he that had so boldly opened
his love unto her, persuaded her self assuredly it was her host: and having
with her Gentlewoman sought round about the chamber, to see if they could
find him: in a great rage she said, Assure your self this is not doont but
only by the master of the house; but in the morning I will so deal with my
Lord my brother, that with his head he shall witness my chastity. Which his
fury the gentlewoman perceiving, said: Madam, I much rejoice at the great care
you have unto your honor, which to augment, you would not spare the life of
him, that by the force of love has hazarded himself, but oftentimes there are
such as seek to increase it, to the contrary do diminish it: wherefore Madam I
beseech you not to disclose the truth. And when the Princess had told her
how it happened, the Gentlewoman said unto her: Your Ladyship assures me that
he obtained naught of you but blows and scratches. Of that I assure you said
she, and in such manner, that if he found not a good surgeon, I think the
marks will easily appear. Madam, seeing it is so, said the Gentlewoman, me
thinks you have more occasion to praise God, than to think on your revenge:
for you may well suppose that, seeing he had so good courage to enterprise such
a thing, than the despite he has received in failing thereof, you cannot give
him any death, that would not be much easier unto him. If you desire to be
revenged on him, let love and shame work which know how to torment him
better than your self, and do it for your honor; beware Madam I say to fall
into the like; for that in lie^ to obtain the greatest pleasure that he could
devise, he has received the most extreme displesure that any gentleman can
have. And you madam, thinking to increase your honor, may thereby diminish it:
and by making complaint thereof, make that known, that never was known before:
for by him you may be well assured it never shall be revealed: and say my Lord
your brother should do that justice you require, and thereby the poor gentleman
loose his life; yet the common voice would be, that he had his pleasure of you;
and again men would not stick to say, It is impossible for a gentleman to
enterprise such a thing, unless the Lady have given him great occasion. You
are both young and fair, living merrily in companies: there is not any man in
the Court but sees well what favor you show to him whom you suspect, which
will make all men judge, that if he has enterprised such a thing, it was not
done without some fault committed on your behalf. And your Honor, which
hitherto has made you hold your head aloft, shall by that means be brought in
question wheresoever it shall be known. The Princess hearing the good reasons
alleged by her gentlewoman, knew well she said the truth, and that with good
reason she should be blamed, considering the private and good countenance
she had always shown unto the gentleman, asked her what she were best to do,
who answered her, and said: madame, seeing it pleases you to hear council,
perceiving from what affection it proceeds, me thinks you should be merry at
your heart to see, that the fairest and honestest gentleman that ever I knew,
could neither by love nor force, make you dishonest your self. Wherein madame,
you ought to thank God, acknowledgeing it not to be done of your self, for
that many women, leading far more stricter lives then you, have been overcome
and vanquished by men less worthy to be loved then he: and you ought now more
then ever to abstain from hearing any discourses of love, because many there
are, which having anoyded the first occasion, yet in the second could not
resist. Remember good madame, that love is blind, and blinds men in such
sort, that where men think the way to be most sure, there commonly their feet
do soonest slip. And me thinks madam that you ought neither unto him nor any
other make it known, and though he would remember you thereof, yet make you as
though you knew it not, thereby to avoid all dangers that ensue, the one of
vain glory, in respect of the victory you have had, the other in calling
things to mind that are so pleasant to the flesh, that most chaste persons
have much to do to keep themselves from some sparks thereof, although they
shun them as much as in them lies. And further (Madam) to the end he shall
not think that he has hazarded a thing which might content or please you: I
am of this opinion, that by little and little you shall withdraw the good
countenance you have used toward him, to the end he may perceive how much
you dislike of that his folly, and how great your goodness is, in contenting
your self with the victory that God has given you, without requiring further
revenge of him. And I beseech God madam (said she) give you the grace to
continue the honesty he has put into your heart; and knowing that all
goodness comes from him, you may love and serve him better than ever you did
before. The princess therewith determined to follow her Gentlewomans counsel,
and thereupon slept with as quiet and glad a mind, as the gentlman to the
contrary waked in great despair. The next day the Lord would ride away, and
ask for his host, who was certified he was so sick that he could not endure
to see the light, or speak to any man; whereat the prince was much abashed,
and would have seen him, but knowing he took his rest, would not disease
him, and so without bidding him farewell, departed from his house, taking both
his wife and his sister with him: who understanding the gentleman's excuse, that
would not see the prince, nor yet his company before they went, was well
assured it was he that so had troubled her, not daring to show the marks she
had set upon his face: and although his master sent often for him, yet would
he not return unto the Court, before he had perfitly healed all his wounds,
except that only which love and despite had made within his heart. But when
he went unto the prince, and that he found himself before his victorious
enemy, he could not choose but blush; and he that of all others had bin most
aduenturous, was so astonished, that ofttimes in her presence he was abashed,
whereby she assured her self their suspicion to be true, and by little and
little estranged herself from him, not so covertly, but he perceived it well,
yet durst not be seen therein, fearing to have worse, and kept his love within
his heart, with the patience of withdrawing it, which he had well deserved.

The fifth Novel.
Of a Watermans wife that escaped from two Friars that would have forced her,
and wrought in such manner, that their fact was discovered.

AT the port of Cullen hard by Nyort, there was a woman that both night and day
did continualy bear men over the water, where it happened two friars to pass
over in her beat, and no other company with them: and for because that it is
one of the longest passages in France, to the end they might keep her from
weariness, they moved her with love, wherein she answered them as she ought
to do. But they not being weary of the way, neither yet by reason of the
coldness of the water, any thing a^olde, nor at the woman's denial once seemed
abashed, each of them determined to force her, and if she cried out, to cast
her into the river: but she being as wise and subtle as they malicious fools,
spoke unto them, and said: I am not altogether so discourteous, as outwardly I
show; but first I would desire you to grant me two requests, which done, you
shall well perceive that I have better will to obey you than you desire. With
that the friars swore unto her by their good S. Frauncis, that whatsoever she
asked of them she should be sure to obtain, so they might have their
desires. First then said she, I will have you swear and promise me of your
faiths, never to make it known to any man but your selves, which they
willingly yielded unto: and then she said that they should take their pleasures
one after an other, for that said she I should be much ashamed that any man
should look upon me while I did it, wherefore said she, cast lottes between
you who shall first begin. They saw her requests so reasonable, the younger friar
consented that the elder should be first, and aproching near an Island she said
unto the younger, Pray you here in this Island till I have carried your fellow
into an other Island, and if at his return he do like well of me, we will
leave him here, and go to an other place with you. Wherewith the younger Friar
leapt into the Island, staying the return of his companion, whom the woman
brought into another, and being at the shore, making as though she tied the
boat, said unto him: Friend, look what place we were left to go into,
wherewith the good father stepped into the Island, to find convenient place, and
he was no sooner on land, but she giving a thrust with her foot against a
tree, made her boat to give back into the river, leaving the two holy fathers
in the Isles, to whom she cried as loud as ever she could, and said: Stay
there my masters till God send his holy Angel to comfort you, for of me, as
this day, you get not any thing that may content you. The two poor friars
perceiving her deceit, kneeled down upon the shore, desiring her not to
discredit them, promising her, if that she would carry them to the haven, they
would not trouble her: but she rowing on, said unto them: I might well be
counted a fool, having escaped your hands, to put my self into your dangers
again. Which done, returning to ye village, she called her husband and the
officers, desiring them to help to take two great devouring wolves, from whom
(by Gods help) she had escaped. They being well accompanied, went thither,
for that neither great nor little within the village, but was desirous to be
partaker of that sport. The two poor friars perceiving so great a company
coming to them, hid themselves in the Isles (like Adam from the presence of
God) shame setting their sins before their eyes, and fear of punishment made
them so tremble, that in a manner they were half dead. But that kept them not
from being taken and led to prison, not without great shouting and crying of
the people: some saying, these good fathers preach chastity unto us, yet would
defile our wives: and her husband said, they dare not handle money, and yet
will handle our women's thighs, which are more dangerous. Others said, they are
sepulchers all beautified without, and inwardly filled with dead and rotten
diseases. And others cried, and said, that by their fruits men might perceive
what trees they were. So that you must believe that all the passages which are
found to be in the holy Scriptures against hypocrites, were alleged against
those poor prisoners, that by the gardiens means were succored and
delivered: who in great haste came thither to fetch them, assuring the
officers, that he would use greater justice against the^, then the secular
Judge could do. And to satisfy the party, he protested they would say as
many prayers for her as she would desire: whereupon the Judge granted him his
request, and delivered him the prisoners, that were so well schooled by the
gardien (being an honest man) that never after they passed over the river
without making the sign of the holy cross, and commending themselves to God.

The sixth Novel.
The subtlety of a woman, that found means to let her friend escape, when her
husband (having but one eye) thought to surprise him.

THere was an old servant of the chamber to Charles last duke of Alonson,
that had lost one of his eyes, and was married to a woman much younger then
himself, he being by his master and mistress as well beloved as any man of
his estate could be, whereby he had not means to visit his wife so often as
willingly he would, which was the cause that she forgot both honor and
conscience, and fell in love with a young Gentleman, which in fine was so well
known, that at length her husband was advertised: which he would not believe,
by reason of the great and outward signs of love his wife did show unto him.
Nevertheless, one day thinking to find it out, and if he could, to be
revenged on him that did him wrong, he fained to go into the country not
far from thence, where he said, he must stay at the least two or three
days. He being gone, his wife sent for her man, but he had not been with her
above half an hour, when her husband came again, and in great haste knocked
at the door, which the perceiving, told her friend, whereat he was so much
abasht, that he wished himself in his mothers belly, and cursed both her, and
love, that had brought him to that danger: she bade him take no thought, saying
she would find means to let him go without shame or harm, willing him with
all speed to make him ready. Mean time the husband knocked still at the door,
and called his wife as loud as ever he could, but she counterfeiting as if she
knew him not, said unto her servant, why do you not rise, and make them leave
their noise, that knock and call so hastily at the door: is this a time of
night to come and knock at honest men's doors? if my husband were here, he
would make you leave. The husband hearing his wife speak, called her as loud
as he could, and said, Wife, open the door: will you let me stand here till
it be day? And when she saw her friend was ready to go out, opening the door,
she said unto her husband: Oh hushand, how glad am I that you are come; for I
had a strange dream, wherewith I was so well pleased, as possible might be,
because I dreamt that you had recovered ye sight of your other eye, and with
that embracing and kissing him, she took him by the head, and with one of her
hands stopping his good eye, asked him, do you not see better then you were
wont to do? and while he could not see at all, she let her friend go out.
Whereof her husband doubted, and said: By God wife, I will never watch you
again, for that in thinking to deceive you, I have found the finest subtlety
that ever was invented. God amend you, for it is not in the power of any man
living, to prevent the malice of a woman, unless he kill her. But seeing the
good enterteinment you have had at any hands, could not procure you to amend,
it may be, my absence will force you thereunto. Which said, he went his way,
and left his wife in great discomfort, who by means of his kinsemen, friends
excuses, and tears, was of him received again.

The seventh Novel.
A merchant of Paris deceived the mother of his love, to cover their fault.

IN the city of Paris there was a merchant that loved a maid that dwelt hard
by him, or to say the truth, better loved of her, then she of him: for that
the show he made to love her, was but to cover a more honorable and haughty
love then hers. But she that was content to be deceived, loved him so well,
that she had wholly forgotten the manner that women ought to use, in refusing
men. This crafty companion, after he had long time taken pains to go to her,
in the end made her so fond, that she ran after him: which her mother, being
an honest woman, perceiving, wholly forbade her the company of that merchant,
which if she observed not, she said she would place her in a religious house.
But the daughter that loved the merchant more then she feared her mother, made
more of him then ever she did: and one day being in a chamber alone, the
merchant went in, who finding place convenient, spoke as secretly unto her as
possibly he might, but a certain maid seeing him going in, went and told her
mother, who in great cholar ran thither: and when her daughter heard her
come, she wept unto the merchant, and said, Alas my love, now the love I bear
unto you, shall be dearly bought, here comes my mother who will surely know yt
which she always feared. The merchant that therewith was not abasht, left her
presently, and went to meet her mother, and opening his arms, embraced her as
hard as ever he could, and with the same fury wherewith he used the daughter,
he threw the poor old woman upon a bed, who found that manner of enterteinment
to be so strange, that she knew not what to do, but only to say, what will you
have? what are you mad? but for all that he left not off to handle her in
such sort as if she had been the fairest maid in all the world: and had it
not been that she cried so loud, that both her men and mayds came in to
help, she had past the same way which she so much feared for her daughter.
Wherefore by maine strength they took the poor old woman out of the
merchants arms, without once knowing, nor yet could ever know, the cause
wherefore he used her so. Mean time her daughter got into another house,
wherein there was a wedding, which time the merchant and she did often call to
mind, and laughed thereat, but to the old wives cost, that never could
perceive it.

The eight Novel.
A certain man having lien with his wife, thinking she had been his maid,
sent his companion thither, that made him cuckolde, his wife not knowing
thereof.

IN the county of Aller, there was a man called Bornet, that had married an
honest woman, whose credit and reputation he loved, as all the husbands that
are here in place (as I think) do, and although he desired his wife should
be faithful unto him, yet he would not that the law (in that case) should
be equal to them both: for that he became amorous of his maid, in which
exchange he feared nothing, but that diversity of meats would not please him.
He had a neighbor, of one condition, named Sandras, both a Drum maker and a
Tailor, between whom there was so great familiarity, that their wives only
excepted, their goods were in a manner common: whereupon he showed his friend
the enterprise he meant to make upon his maid, who not only liked it well,
but to his power help to bring it to pass, hoping to have some share therein.
The maid that would not consent thereto, perceiving her self so hardly
followed, showed to her mistress, desiring her to give her leave to go unto
her friends, saying she could not live in that sort. The mistress that loved
her husband well, whom she did suspect, being very glad to have occasion
thereby justly to charge him, said unto her maid, content your self, and
hold my husband with fair words, and in the end appoint him to lie with you,
but fail not at any hand to tell me certainly the night when the same shall
be, and take heed that no man knows it. The maid did as her mistress had
commanded, which pleased her master so well, that he went to tell his friend,
who desired him, that seeing he had been a partner in making the match, he
might likewise have some part of that he left. The promise made, and the time
come, the master went to bed (as he thought) with his maid, but she that had as
then renounced the authority of commanding, for the pleasure to be a servant,
had laid her self in the mayds bed, and received her husband therein, not as
a wife, but rather seemed a bashful maid, and in such manner, that her husband
could never perceive it. I cannot tell you which of them was best pleased,
whether he in thinking to deceive his wife, or she to deceive her husband: but
when he had been with her, not so long as pleased him, but as he found
himself able to bear it out, being not altogether so stout a warrier, as
otherwise he had been, he rose and went out of the house, where finding his
companion stronger and younger then himself, told him that he had found the
best gown that ever he saw. You know said his companion, what you promised me.
Go then quickly, said the master, lest she should rise, or that my wife should
call her for some business. His companion went thither, and found the same
maid there which the husband had mistaken, who thinking him to be her husband,
refused not whatsoever he would ask: I mean by asking, taking, for he durst
not speak. And there he stayed longer then the husband did before: whereat the
woman wondered, for she was not wont to have such kind of nights:
nevertheless, she was content, comforting herself with the speeches which in
the morning she meant to use unto him, and with the mockery. About break of
day the man rose up, and in departing from her, being disposed to play, by
chance he took a ring from off her finger, which ring her husband gave her
when they married: (a thing which the women of that country do keep in great
solemnity, and honor much that woman which keeps her ring until she dies:
and to the contrary, if she chance to lose it, she is discredited, as having
given her faith unto another man besides her husband) she was content that he
should take it, thinking that it would serve for a certain token of his late
deceit. When the companion returned again, he asked him, what he had done, and
how he liked the match: he told him he was of his opinion, and that if he had
not feared day, he had not come as yet, wherewith as softly as they could they
went to bed. In the morning, as he made him ready, the husband perceived the
ring which his companion ware upon his finger, in all points like to that which
he had given his wife when they were married; wherewith he asked his companion
of whom he had it: but when he understood he had snatched it from the maid, he
was abasht, and began to lean his head against the wall, and said: Good God,
have I made my self cuckolde, my wife not knowing it? his companion to comfort
him, spoke and said, It may be, your wife when she went to bed, gave your maid
the ring to keep. With that the husband went into the house, where he found
his wife, fairer, finer, and merrier then usually she had been, as she that
much rejoiced to have saved the conscience of her maid, and tried her husband
even to the full, with no more loss then watching for a night. The husband
perceiving her to seem so pleasant, said within himself: If she knew my
fortune, she would not look so merrily upon me: and speaking unto her of
diverse things, he took her by the hand, and perceiving she had not the ring,
which she never put off her finger, he became so much abasht, that with a
trembling voice, he asked her and said, What have you done with your ring? but
she that was full glad that he began to move that which she her self desired
to utter, said unto him: O the most wicked man that ever lived on the earth,
from whom think you, you took the ring? you thought you took it from my
maid, for whose sake you have spent double so much more of your good nesse,
then ever you did for me: for the first time that you came to me, I esteemed
you so amorous of her, that more you could not be, but after you went out, and
then came in again, you seemed to be a devil, and not a man; O unhappy
wretch; think with your self what blindness has bewitched you, so much to
use my company whereof you have received the pleasure, and yet esteemed it not.
It is not then the beauty or person of your maid that made you find such
pleasure at this time; but it is sin and filthy lust that burns in your
heart, and makes your head so mad, that you had taken a goat at that time
for a wench. Now husband, it is time to mend your life, and content your self
with me, knowing me to be your own, and an honest woman, and think what you
have done, supposing me to be your chamber maid: that I have done was only to
withdraw from you sin, to the end that in our age, we both may live in love,
with quiet consciences. For if you mean to live as you have done, I had rather
separate my self, then daily to behold the destruction of your soul, your
body, and your goods before my face. But if you will confess your fault, and
purpose now to live in godly sort, obeying him, I will forget all former
faults, as I beseech the Lord to pardon my ingratitude, in not loving him as I
ought. If ever man was abasht, and in despair, surely it was this man,
perceiving his wife so fair, so chaste and honest, to have been left by him,
for one that loved him not, and which is worse, to have been so accursed, to
have made her do amiss, not knowing it, and made another partaker of that
pleasure that only was for him, whereby he made himself to wear the horns,
to his perpetual shame. But perceiving his wife so moved, touching the love he
bare unto the maid, was well advised not to disclose the wicked touch he had
played with her, but asking her forgiveness, with promise to forgo his wicked
life, he gave her the ring again, which he had taken from the other man, whom
he besought not to disclose the fact. But diverse things are spoken secretly
that after come to light: for not long time after the truth thereof was
known, and he was called cuckold, without disgrace to her.

The ninth Novel.
The pitiful death of an amorous Gentleman, by having over late received
comfort, from the Gentlewoman whom he loved.

Between Daulphinois and Prouance there was a Gentleman much richer in virtue,
beauty, and honesty, than of worldly goods, that extremely loved a
Gentlewoman, whose name I will not now rehearse, for her kindred sake, that are
proceeded of great and rich houses; but assure your selves the thing is most
true: and because he was not of the like house, he durst not discover his
affection, for that the extreme love he bare unto her was so great and so
perfect, that he had rather die than to desire any thing that might have been
to her dishonor, and perceiving himself to be of so mean parentage in
respect of hers, was wholly out of hope to marry her. Wherefore his love was
grounded upon no other point, than only to love her with all his power, as
perfectly as he could: which he so long continued, that in the end she had
some inkling thereof; and perceiving the love he bare unto her, so full of
virtue and good speeches, she esteemed herself most happy to be beloved of one
that was so virtuous, and gave him thereupon so good countenaunces, that he
which sought no other thing, was there with well pleased. But malice the enemy
of all quietness, could not endure this honest and happy life, for that certain
men said unto the mother of the gentlewoman, that they were much abashed what
that gentleman made so much within her house, and that it was thought her
daughters beauty was the only cause, with whom he was often seen to speak.
The mother which nothing doubted of the gentleman's honest behavior, whereof
she assured herself, as much as of any of her own children, was very sorry to
hear that it was taken in evil part, insomuch that in the end (fearing some
slander by malicious heads might thereby arise) desired him for a time not to
frequent her house, as usually he had done: a thing which he found very hard
to be visgested, knowing that the honest speches he had used to her daughter
deserved no such cause of absence. Nevertheless, to the end he might cease
evil speeches, he forbear for so long time, and at last returned thither
again, as he had done before, whose absence had not diminished his goodwill.
But being in the house, he understood they meant to marry the Gentlewoman
with a gentleman, who in his opinion was not so rich, that he should do him
such wrong, to have his love, no more thou he himself. And thereupon began
to take heart, and to employ his friends to speak for him; thinking that if
the choice were put unto the gentlewoman, she would prefer him before the
other: nevertheless, the mother of the gentlewoman and her friends, because
the other was richer, chose him; where at the gentleman was so much displeased,
that knowing his friend lost as much contentment as himself, by little and
little without other sickness, began to consume, and in short space was
changed, and that in such sort, that it seemed he covered the beauty of his
face, with the mask of death, whereunto from hour to hour he still
approached: yet could he not refrain, but sometimes went to speak with her
whom he so dearly loved. But in the end when strength failed him, be was
constrained to keep his bed, whereof he would not once advertise her whom he
loved, fearing to procure her cause of grief, and so suffering himself to
fall into despair, he lost both his eating, drinking and his natural rest, in
so much that it was impossible to know him by reason of his leanenes and strange
countenance. By chance a friend of his advertised the mother, of his love who
being very charitable, and on the otherside loved the Gentleman so well, as
that if all the friends had been of her and her daughters opinion, they had
preferred his honest behavior before all the riches of the other Gentleman: but
the fathers kindred would not consent thereto. She with her daughter went to
visit him, whom she found rather dead then living, and knowing his death to
approach, had confessed himself, and received the holy sacrament, thinking
presently to die and never to see any man again: but being as it were within
two fingers breadth near to death, seeing her that was his life and
resurrection, felt himself so strong that he cast himself upon a bed saying
unto the lady, what occasion has brought you hither Madame to come and visit
him that has his foot already in the grave, and of whose death you are the
cause? what (said the Lady) may it be possible that he whom we love so well,
should receive his death by our means? I pray you show us for what cause you
use this speech? Madame said he, although as much as in me lay, I have
dissembled the love I bear unto the Gentlewoman your daughter, so it is that
my friends speaking of her marriage and mine together, have spoken more then
willingly I would, considering the mischief that is fallen upon me, to loose
the hope, not for my particular pleasure, but because I know full well she
shall not be so well used, nor so well beloved as she should have been with
me. The good I perceive she loses of the best and most affectionat servant
and friend that she has in this world, procures me more grief, then the
loss of this my life, which for her only I would preserve, but seeing it can
serve her to no end, in loosing it, it is to me great profit. The mother and
the daughter hearing his discourse, sought by all means to comfort him. The
mother saying unto him, be of good courage and I promise you of my faith, that
if God send you your health, my daughter shall never have other husband then
your self, and here she is in presence, whom I command to give her faith unto
you, The daughter weeping, labored to do that which her mother promised she
should: but he knowing that when he should be whole, he should not have his
love, and that the good speech she uttered unto him, was only but to prove
if that she could reviue him. Once again he said unto her, that if those
words had been spoken unto him three months before, he had been the
healthfullest and the happiest Gentleman in France, but the relief came now so
late, that it could not be believed, nor yet hoped, and when he saw they
enforced themselves to make him to believe it, he said unto them: Well seeing I
perceive you promise me that good which never will come to pass, although you
desire it should; for the weakness wherein I am, I crave of you, a thing much
less then that, which hitherto I never was so bold for to require: with that,
both of them swear to grant it bidding him freely speak. I beseech you then
said he, that you will give her into my arms, whom you do promise me shall
be my wife, and command her to embrace and kiss me. The daughter that never
had used any such entertainment, thought to deny it him: but her mother
commanded her expressly, perceiving there was no more lively feeling in him,
then in a dead man. Therewith the daughter by her mothers commandment went to
the sick man's bed, and said unto him, my good friend, I pray you comfort your
self. The poor languishing Gentleman as well as he could in his extreme
weakness, stretched forth his arms, nothing but shinne and bones, and with all
the strength of his body embraced the cause of that his death, and kissing her
with his pale and cold lips, held her as long as possible he could, and then
said unto her, the love I have borne unto you has been so great and honest,
that never (marriage set apart) did I desire other favor at your hands, then I
have now: for want whereof, and therewith I will most gladly yield my spirit
unto God, who is perfect love and charity, and knows the greatness of my love,
and my honest desire beseeching him (having my whole delight between mine
arms) to receive my spirit in his hands and saying so, took her again into his
arms so vehemently, that the weak heart being not able to sustain that
force, was wholly forsaken of all his lively spirits, for that the joy made it
so to rejoice, that the soul abandoning her place, departed from the body, and
although the poor body continued without life, and by that means could no
more hold her grief, nevertheless the love, which the Gentlewoman had
always hidden showed it self so much at that time, that the mother and her
servants had much ado to separate their bodies. But by force pulled the living
almost dead from the dead whom they caused honorably to be buried: but the
greatest triumph used at his obsequie was, the tears, sorrows and cries of
the poor Gentlewoman, which showed so much the more after his death, as she
dissembled them during his life, in a manner satisfying the wrong that she had
done unto him, and since that time, (as I have heard) what husband soever she
had given her, she was never merry at her heart.

The tenth Novel.
The incontinencie of a Duke, together with his impudency to attain his
desire, with the just punishment of his evil intent.

LOng since there was a Duke of Florence, that had married the lady Margaret
bastard daughter to the emperor Charles the fifth: and because as yet she was
so young, that he might not lie with her, staying till she came to years, he
used her very kindly, for that to spare her he was amorous of certain Ladies
in the city, which by night he went to visit, while his wife slept. Among
others he loved a very fair, wise, and honest Gentlewoman, sister to a
Gentleman, of whom the Duke made great account, and to whom he gave so great
authority in his house, that his word was as much feared and obeyed as if he
had bin the Duke himself: and there was no secret in his heart, that he made
not known to him, in such sort that he might well be termed a second Duke. The
Duke perceiving his sister to be so honest, that by no means he could declare
his love unto her; after he had sought all means he could, he went to the
Gentleman, whom he loved so well, and said unto him: If there were any thing
in this world (my good friend said he) that I would refuse to do for you, I
should fear to show you my desire, and much more to entreat you to be
assistant unto me. But I bear such love unto you, as that if I had either
wife, mother, or daughter, that might be a means to save your life, I would
rather employ them therein, than let you die for want of them. And I esteem
the love you bear to me, to be no less, and in such sort, that if I my self
which am your master, do bear you such affection, you can not at the least
bear less to me. Wherefore I mean to utter a secret unto you, the secrecy
whereof brings me in such a case as you now see, whereof I never hope
redress, but only by death, or by the service which in this respect you now
may do unto me. The Gentleman hearing his masters reasons, and perceuing his
face, unfeignedly wet with tears, took such pity on him; that he said unto
him: My Lord, all the good and honor I have proceeds from you, you may speak
to me, as to your friend, being well assured, that the thing which is in my
power, is already in your hands. With that the Duke began to declare unto
him the love he bare unto his sister, which was so great and strong, as that if
by his means he could not obtain the same, he was not able to live long, as
knowing well that in regard of her, neither prayers nor presents would ought
prevail, wherefore he desired him, that if he loved his life, as much as he
his, he would find means to win him that favor, which without him he never
hoped for. The brother that loved his sister, and the honor of his house, more
then the Dukes pleasure, sought by certain reasons to dissuade him, beseeching
him to employ him in any other thing rather than that, which might be so great
a dispight unto him, as to purchase the dishonor of his own blood, saying that
his heart and honor could not agree to do him service therein. The Duke
inflamed with an insupportable rage, put his finger in his mouth, biting his
nail, and answered him in great fury, Well seeing I find no friendship in
you, I know what I must do. The gentleman knowing the cruelty of his master,
was in great fear, and said unto him: My lord, seeing it is your pleasure, I
will speak unto her, and tell you what she says. The Duke answered, going
from him, if you love my life, I will likewise love yours. The Gentleman
understood well what that word meant, and was a day or two before he saw the
Duke again, thinking what he had to do: on the one side he set before his
eyes the duty he ought unto his master, with the riches and honors that by
his means he had received, on the other side, the honor of his house, the
honesty and chastity of his sister, whom he knew would never consent to so
dishonest an action, if by subtlety she were not deceived, or by force
compelled thereunto: a thing which he would find very strange, seeing that
thereby both he and his should be defamed. Wherefore he determined, that he had
rather die, then commit so wicked a fact against his sister, being one of the
honestest women in all Italy, and that he would rather deliver his country of
such a tyrant, then by force to bring so great a shame upon his own house: for
that he was assured, that without the Dukes death, his life, nor yet his
friends could be in saftie: wherefore without speaking to his sister, he
determined by one means to save his own life, and revenge her shame, at the
end of two days he went unto the Duke, and said unto him, that he had so well
practiced with his sister (not without great pain) that in the end she
consented to his will, upon condition he should keep the thing so secret, that
none but her brother should know thereof. The Duke that desired those news,
believed him, and embracing the messenger, promised him whatsoever he would
desire, desiring him to bring the same to pass with as much speed as might
be: whereupon they did appoint the day. If the Duke was glad, you need not
doubt: and when he knew the night (he so much desired) to approach, wherein he
hoped to obtain the victory of her, whom he esteemed invincible, he withdrew
himself with the Gentleman only, not forgetting to put on his coife and
perfumed shirt, the best that could be found. And when all were gone to rest,
he went with the Gentleman unto his house, where he entered into a very
pleasant chamber: there the Gentleman pulled off his night gown, and laid him
in his bed, saying unto him, I will go fetch her, that will not enter into
this chamber without blushing, but I hope before morning, she will be assured
of you: with that he left the Duke, and went into his chamber, where he found
but one of his men, to whom he said: Dare thou be so hardy to follow me unto
a place, where I will revenge my self of the greatest enemy I have in all ye
world. His man ignorant what he would do, said: Sir, that I will, were it the
Duke himself. With that the Gentleman led him so suddenly that he had no
other weapon then a poinard at his back. When the Duke heard him come again,
thinking he brought her with him whom he loved so well, he opened the
curtains to see and receive her, he had so long attended, but in sted of
seeing her by whom he hoped the preservation of his life, he beheld his own
headlong falling into death, being a naked sword which the gentlman had drawn,
wherewith he struck the Duke being in his shirt, who being destitute of arms,
but not of heart, set himself upright within the bed and took the Gentleman by
the middle, saying unto him, Is this the promise you keep? and seeing he had
no other weapon but his teeth and nails, he bit the Gentleman by the thumb,
and by strength of arms defended himself so well, that both of them fell upon
the bed: the Gentleman being not well assured, called his servant, who finding
the Duke and his Master so hardly elasped together, that he knew not which
to choose, drew them both by the feet into the middle of the chamber, and with
his poniard assaied to eut the Dukes throat, who defended himself until the
loss of his blood made him so weak that he could do no more. Then the
Gentleman and his servant laid him in his bed, where with the stabs of a
dagger they made an end of killing him, and drawing their curten they went
their ways, and shut the dead body within the chamber, and when he found
himself victorious of his enemy, by whose death he hoped to set the common
wealth at liberty, though his cruelty should yet be imperfect, if he do not as
much to five or six of those that were the Dukes nearest kinseme^. And to
bring the same to pass, he said unto his servant that he would go and fetch
them one after the other, to deal with them as he had done with the Duke: but
his servant being neither strong nor bold, said unto him, me thinks sir, you
have done enough at this time, and that you shall do better in thinking how
to save your own life, then seek to take it from others, for if we stay so
long to kill each of them, as we do about the Duke* the day will sooner
discover our enterprise, then we shall bring it to an end, although we found
out enemies without defense, the Gentleman, whose wicked conscience made him
fearful believed his servant, and taking him with him, went unto the Bishop
that had charge of opening the gates of the City, and to command the posts and
said unto him, I have this night received news that a brother of mine is at the
point of death, so that I have desired license of the Duke to go unto him, who
has granted it me, wherefore I pray you command the posts to give me two good
horses, and will the porter to open me the gates. The Bishop that esteemed his
request no less then the commandment of the Duke his master, gave him
presently a billet, by virtue whereof the gate was opened unto him, and the
horses delivered according to his desire, and instead of going to see his
brother, he went to Venice, where he caused the bytings he had received by the
Duke to be healed, and from thence went into Turquie. In the morning the Dukes
servants seeing him so long before he came, suspected he was gone to see some
Gentlewoman, but perceiving him to stay, began on al sides to seek him out.
The poor Duchess that began to love him well, knowing he could not be found,
was in great fear: but when the Gentleman he loved so well, could no more be
found then he, they went to seek him at his house, and finding blood at his
chamber door, entered into the chamber, but no man could tell them news, and
following the tears of the blood, the Dukes poor servants came to the chamber
wherein he was, which they found locked, but they soon brake down the door:
and perceiving the place all full of blood, they drew the curtin and there
found the poor body within the bed, sleeping his long sleep. You may well
think what sorrow his poor servants made, that bare the body to his palace,
whither the Bishop came, who told them how the Gentleman was departed by night
in great haste under pretense to go and see his brother: wherefore it was
evidently found that it was he that had done the murder. And it was proved
that his poor sister, had never heard thereof, who although she was abashe at
that had happened, yet she loved her brother the more, that had delivered her
from so cruel a Prince, enemy of her chastity, not having for the safeguard
thereof, feared to hazard his own life: and continued more and more her honest
and virtuous life, in such sort, that although she was but poor, because
their house and goods was all confiscate, yet she and her sister found as rich
husbands as any were in Italy, and ever since have lived in great reputation.

The eleventh Novel.
The subtilty of an amorous gentleman, that under the favor and countenance of
a good friend, obtained of a Gentlewoman of Millan the fruits of his forepassed
labors.

IN the duchy of Millan at such time as the great master of Chaumont was
governor: there was a Gentleman named the Lord of Boniuet, who after for his
virtues, was Admiral of France. He being at Millan well-beloved of the great
Master and of all others, for the virtues that were in him, used much to
bankets where the Ladies and Gentlemen did resort, of whom he was better
esteemed then ever any French man before him had been, as well for his beuty,
good grace, and pleasant speech, as for the report given of him, to be one of
the valiantest and stoutest warriors that ever was in his time. Upon a day
being in a mask in shroue week, he led one of the brauest and fairest
Gentlewomen in all the City to dance with him, and when the hautboies paused,
he failed not to solicit her with love, which he knew better then others how
to do. But she that was not behind in answering him, would suddenly cast her
fan before her face and stay him, assuring him that she loved not, nor ever
would love any but only her husband, wishing him not to hope for any other at
her hands. This answer made not the Gentleman to forbear, but ernestly
pursued her, until lent: but for a resolution he found her firm and constant
in determination, neither to love him nor any other, which he could not
believe, considering the hard countenance of her husband and her great beauty:
wherefore seeing she so much dissembled, he determined likewise to use deceit.
And from that time forwards left off his suite, and enquired so well of her
life, that he found she loved a very wise and honest Gentleman of Italy: the
said Lord of Boniuet by little and little acquainted himself with the said
Gentleman, in such crafty and subtle manner that he never could perceive, but
he loved him so well, that after his Lady, he was the man that in the world he
most loved. The Lord of Boniuet to find the secret of his heart, feined to show
him his, and that he loved a Gentlewoman whom he never thought upon, desiring
him to keep his secret, and besought him that their hearts and minds might be
all one. The poor Gentleman to show him the like favor told him at large of
his love he bare unto the Gentlewoman, whereof Boniuet sought to be revenged,
and once a day they met in some place or other to show their good fortunes
that day past, which the one told in good truth, the other dissembling. And
the gentleman confessed that he had loved that gentlewoman for the space of
three years together, without ever obtaining any other things at her hands,
than only fair speeches, with assurance to be beloved of her. The said Boniuet
counseled him the best way he could, to find the means to bring his
purpose to pass; whereby he found himself so well eased, that in few days
after she granted him his desire: and there rested nothing but to find the
means to execute the same, which by the lord Boniuets means was soon found
out.

One day before supper the Gentleman said unto him. Sir I am more beholding to
you than to all the men in the world, for that by your good counsel I hope this
night to reap that I have so many years labored to obtain. I pray thee
said Boniuet show me the manner of the enterprise, to see if there be deceit or
hazard therein, that I may aid and serve thee as a friend. The Gentleman told
him how she meant to leave the street door open, under pretense of a certain
disease that one of her brethren had, for whom at all times of the night they
were forced to fetch some thing or other: and that he might assuredly enter
into the Court: but that he was to take heed he went not up the great
stairs, but rather, a small pair of stairs on the right hand, and so enter
into the first gallery, where he should find that all the doors of the
chambers of her father and brother in law did open, and that he should choose
the third door nearest unto the said stairs, and that if in thrusting it
softly from him he found it shut, he should not stay, being assured that her
husband was come, who nevertheless was not to return in two days, and that
if he found it open, he should go in softly, and then shut it to him, knowing
thereby not any body to be therein, but she her self; and that above all, he
should not forget to make shoes of felt, fearing to make any noise, and that
he should likewise be sure not to come before two hours after midnight, because
her brethren that loved play, never used to go to bed before one of the clock
at night: the said Boniuet answered him and said: Go my friend, God be thy
speed, I beseech him to keep them from encumbrance, if my company may
pleasure thee, I will not spare any thing that is in my power. The Gentleman
thanked him most heartily, and told him that in such an enterprise he could
not be too sure, and went presently to take order for the same. The L. of
Boniuet for his part slept not, and perceiving it time to be revenged on his
cruel Dame, withdrew himself in good time unto his lodging, and caused his
beard to be cut of the same length and breadth that the Gentleman ware his
beard, and cut his hairs likewise, to the end that by touching, their
difference might not be known: he forgate not his felt shoes, and the rest of
his apparel like unto the Gentlewomans: and because he was much beloved of
the father in law to that Gentlewoman, was not afraid to go thither in good
time, thinking that if he were perceived, he would go strait unto the old man's
chamber, with whom he had some business to do; and about midnight entered into
the gentlewomans house, where he found diverse of the house stirring, but yet
he passed and was not known, and so entered into the gallory; and touching the
two first doors, he found them shut, but not the third, which he thrust softly
from him, and being in the chamber, he shut the door to him, and perceived
all the chamber to be hanged with white linen cloth, the floor and the roof
in like sort, and a bed of linen very fine, so well wrought with white work
as possible might be, and the Gentlewoman alone within the bed in her smock
and a wastecoate all set with pearls and stones, which he perceived through the
curtains, not being seen of her, for there stood a great candle of white wax
upon the table, that made her chamber seem as light as day: but fearing to be
known by her, he put it out: that done, he put off his clothes unto his shirt,
and laid himself down by her, she thinking it had been the Gentleman that
had loved her so long, received him in as friendly manner as she could: but he
that knew it was done in the name of another man, would not speak a word, but
thought only to execute his revenge, which was to bereave her, both of honor
and chastity, without giving her thanks: but against his will and
determination, the Gentlewoman contented herself so well with that revenge,
that she thought she had recompensed him well for his pains, until an hour
after midnight, that it was time to bid her farewell, and then as softly as he
could, he asked her if she were as well content with him as he with her: she
thinking it had been her friend, said that she was not only content, but
marueiled at his great love, that had made him stay an whole hour from
speaking unto her: with that he began to laugh, saying unto her, Well
Gentlewoman, will you refuse me another time, as til now you have used to do?
She that knew him by his speech and laughter, for shame was almost desparate,
and more then a thousand times called him villain, traitor, and cousiner,
thinking to rise out of the bed, to find a knife to kill herself, seeing she
had been so accursed, to lose her honor, for a man she loved not, and that to
be revenged on her, might make it known to all the world. But he held her in
his arms, and by good and fair speeches, assured her to love her more then
him she^ loved, and that he would be secret, in such sort that she should never
hear it. Which the poor fool believed: and understanding his invention, and
the pains that he had taken for to win her, swear she would love him better
then the other, that could not keep his secrets: and said that she then knew
the contrary of the false report given of French men, for they were wiser, more
perceiuant, and discreet then the Italians: wherefore from thenceforward she
would desist from her opinion touching his countrymen, to content her mind
with him. But she desired him very earnestly, that for a time he would not be
in place, or banquet where she might come, but only in a mask, because she
knew full well she should be so ashamed, that her countenance would make it
known to all the world. He promised her it should be so, and prayed her that
when her friend came about two of the clock, that she would bid him welcome,
and that after by little and little she might cast him off. Whereof she made so
great difficulty, that but only for the love she bare unto him, she would
have granted it. Nevertheless in bidding him adue, he contented her so well,
that she would willingly have had him stayed longer. After he was up and made
him ready, he went out of the chamber, and left the door as he had found it:
and because it was almost two of the clock after midnight, and that he feared
to meet the Gentleman in the way, he stayed at the top of the stairs, where
presently after he saw him pass by, and enter into the chamber. Which done he
went straight unto his lodging, to rest him of his travails, in such sort,
that at nine of the clock in the morning they found him in his bed. When he
was rising, the Gentleman came in, that failed not to show him his fortune, not
so good as he hoped it should have been: for said he, when I entered into the
chamber, I found her up, and set in her mantle, with a fit of an ague upon her,
her pulses beating sore, her face all in a color and sweating, her disease
beginning to come upon her, in such manner, that she desired me presently to
depart, for that fearing some inconvenience, she durst not call her women,
whereby she was so ill at ease, that she had more cause to think on death,
then upon love, and rather to hear speaking of God then of Cupid, being very
sorry for the hazard wherein I had put my self for her, seeing she had not the
means in this world to render me the like, but she hoped to do it in the
world to come. Whereat I was so abasht, that my fire and joy were turned into
ise and sadness, and so I presently departed: and in the morning about break of
day I sent to know how she did, and news were returned me of a certain that
she was very sick: and saying so, he wept so bitterly, that it seemed he
would yield his spirit with tears. Boniuet that had as much desire to laugh as
the other to weep, comforted him the best he could: saying unto him, that
things of long continuance have always a hard beginning, and that love gave
him a delay to cause him to feel a enjoying thereof to be more pleasant, and
therewith they departed from each other. The Gentlewoman for certain days
after kept her bed, and recovering her health, gave her first servant his
farewell, grounding it upon the fear she had of death, and remorce of
conscience, and contented her self with the lord of Boniuet, whereof the amity
endured (according to the custom) as the beauty of the flowers in the field.

The twelfth Novel.
Of a Gentlewoman in the Kings court, that perceiving her self to be disdained
of her husband, that loved other women, she revenged her self by the like
means.

IN the Court of King Francis, the first, there was a Gentleman whose name I
know full well, but I will not name it, he was but poor, as having but 500.
frankes yearly rent, to live on, but so much esteemed of by the King, for the
virtues wherewith he was endowed, that he married so rich a wife, as that a
great Lord would have contented himself with her, and because she was very
young, he desired one of the greatest Ladies in the court to keep her in her
house, which she willingly did. This Gentleman was so honest and so full of
good grace, that all the Ladies in the court made great account of him, and one
among the rest the King loved, yet not so fair nor so young as his own, and
for the great love he bare unto her he made so small account of his wife, that
hardly once a year he lay with her, and which was more importable for her,
was, that he never spoke unto her, nor showed any signs of love: and although
he enjoyed her goods, yet he gave her so small a portion, that hardly was she
apparelled as her estate required, neither as she desired, whereby the Lady
with whom she was, oftentimes reproved the Gentleman, saying unto him: your
wife is fair, rich and of a good house* and you esteem not of her, which her
infancy and young years has borne unto this time, but I fear that when she
shall perceive her self to be fair and of good stature, that some one that
loves you not, seeing beauty (which to you is not esteemed) will seek to
court her so, that in bespight she will do that, which being by you will used
she durst not once conceal. The Gentleman that had set his heart in another
place, mocked her, and for all that ceased not to follow his old course: but
two or three years being past over, his wife began to be one of the fairest
women in all France, and so fair, that she had the whole report in the court
not to have her match: and the more she perceived and felt her self worthy to
be beloved, the more it grieved her to see her husband, that made no account of
her, in such sort, that she took so great displeasure thereat, that without
the comfort of her mistress she was in a manner desperace: and having sought all
means she could to win her husbands love, though with her self it was
impossible, but that he should love her considering the great love she bare
unto him, unless his mind were called otherwise, which she so subtly went
about to know, that in time she found the truth, and that he every night was
so busy elsewhere, that he forgot both his conscience and his wife: and after
she was assured of the life he led, she was so malancholy, that she would wear
nothing but black, nor haunt any places where mirth or good cheer was used.
Which her mistress perceining, did what she could to withdraw her from this sad
conceit; but it was impossible and although her husband were advertised
thereof, yet was he readier to mock her, then to take any order therein. You
know Gentlewoman that grief overcomes joy, and that grief by joy is
overcome. Wherefore it happened that a great Lord near kinsman unto the
mistress of the Gentlewoman and that came often thither, understanding the
strange manner of the Gentlewomans husband, had so great pity on her, that he
thought to try if he could comfort her: and speaking with her found her so
fair and virtuous, that he had more desire to win her favor, then to speak
unto her of her husband: unless it were to show her what small occasion she
had to love him.

The Gentlewoman perceiving her self forsaken of him that ought to love her,
and on the other side loved, and sought unto of so great and fair a prince,
counted her self happy to be so much in his favor. And although she always
desired to preserve her honor, yet she took great pleasure to speak unto him,
and to see her self beloved; a thing whereof she had great want. This love
continued for a time, until by chance the King perceived it, who loved the
Gentleman her husband so well, that he would not suffer any man to procure his
shame or displeasure: wherefore he desired the prince to withdraw his mind,
saying that if he did it not, he would be offended with him. The prince that
loved the kings favor and goodwill better than all the Ladies in the world,
promised him, that for his sake he would leave his enterprise, and that at
night he would take his leave of her: which he did as soon as he understood
her to be in her lodging, and the gentleman himself was lodged in a chamber
over hers: and looking out of his chamber window, perceived the prince to enter
into his wifes chamber being under his. But the prince that saw him well,
stayed not to enter, and bidding her adieu, whose love as then did but begin,
told her the reason was because the King had commanded him so to do. After
many tears and sighs that continued until an hour after midnight, the
gentlewoman for conclusion spoke and said: I thank God (my Lord) that it has
pleased him to alter your opinion, seeing it is so small and feeble that you
can take and leave it at man's commandment. For as for me I have not asked
counsel either of mistress, or of husband, or of my self to love you; for love
helping it self with your beauty and honesty, has had such power over me,
that I have not known other God or King than it: but seeing your heart is not
filled with so true love, that fear as yet remains therein: you cannot be a
perfect friend; and of an imperfect I will not make afriend, for that I love
perfectly, as I had determined to love you, but now (my lord) I am constrained
to bid you farewell, whose fear does not deserve the freedom of my love. With
that the Lord departed weeping, and as he went away, he perceued her husband
still standing at the window, that had both seen him go in and out: wherefore
the next day he told him the occasion why he went unto his wife, and the
commandment the King had given him, wherewith the Gentleman was well pleased,
and thanked the King: but seeing his wife daily to wax fairer than she was,
and he to the contrary became old and less beautiful, began to change
course, taking that which he had caused his wife full often to use, for that he
made more of her than usually ^e did, whereby he took more heed unto her. But
the more she perceived herself sought unto by him, the more she estranged
herself from him, desiring to give him part of the sorrows and griefs she
had had, in being little beloved of him, and not so soon to lay hold on that
pleasure, which love began to show her, she addressed her self unto a young
Gentleman so fair, so well spoken, and of so good a grace that he was beloved
of all the ladies in the court. And making her complaints unto him, how she had
bin well used, moved him to have pity on her, in such manner, that the
Gentleman forgot not any thing that might comfort her: and she to recompense
herself for the loss of a prince that had forsaken her, set her love so sure
upon the gentleman, that she forgot her sorrow past, and thought of nothing
else but how to behave her self therein, which she could do so well, that
her mistress never perceived it, for she never spoke unto him in her presence.
But when she would speak unto him, she went to visit certain ladies that
lodged in the Court: among the which there was one whereof her husband fained
to be amorous; and upon an evening after supper this gentlewoman stole out when
it was dark without company, and went into the ladies chamber, wherein she
found him whom she loved better than her self; and sitting hard by him,
leaving on a table, they spoke together, making semblance as if they had been
reading upon a book: but some one whom her husband had appointed to watch
her, told him whither his wife was gone: he being crafty, went presently
thither, and entering into the chamber, perceived his wife reading in a book,
but making as though he saw her not, went among the ladies to speak to them:
The poor gentlewoman perceiving her husband had found her in his company, to
whom in his presence she had never spoken, was in such fear, that she lost
all sense; and having not the means to pass by a bench, she slid along by a
table, and came away, as if her husband had followed her with a naked sword in
his hand, and went into her mistress chamber, who as then was come into her
lodging; and when her mistress was a bed, she went into her own chamber, where
one of her maids told her, that her husband asked for her: she boldly made
answer, she would not come at him, saying that he was so strange and cruel*
that she feared he would do her some mischief. But in the end, lest worse
should happen, she went unto him: when she came into his chamber, her husband
gave her not a word before they were in bed, where she that could not
dissemble, as he had done, began to weep: And when he asked wherefore she
wept, she said: because she feared he was angry with her, for that he had
found her by a gentleman reading in a book. Whereunto he answered he had never
forbidden her to speak to any man, and that he disliked not of her speaking to
him, but for that she ran away, as if she had done some thing worthy reproach,
and that her running away made him verily suspect she loved the gentleman:
wherefore he forbade her, that from that time forward she should not speak
either privately or publicly unto any man, assuring her, that the first time
she should do it, he would kill her without mercy, which she promised to
perform, making her account at other times not to be so foolish. But because
that in the things that we most desire, the more we are forbidden, so much the
more we desire them. This poor woman had soon forgotten her husbands
threatenings, for that the same night being returned to her chamber to lie with
other gentlewomen that attended on her: she sent to seek the gentleman,
desiring him to come that night to see her. But her husband that was so plagued
with jealousy, that he could not sleep, rose up, and casting a cloak upon
his shoulders, calling one of his servants, went out of his chamber, because he
had understood that thy young gentleman went thither by night, and went and
knocked at his wives chamber door: she that looked for nothing less than her
husband, rose up, and putting a mantle about her, and perceuing that three or
four of her maids slept, went out of the chamber, and came to the door where
he knocked: and asking, who is there? answer was made in the gentleman's name
that she loved: but she for more assurance opened a little hatch, saying: if
you be he you say you are, give me your hand, and I shall know the better: and
having touched her husbands hand, she knew it well, and in all haste shutting
the hatch began to cry out: O sir, it is your hand: her husband answered her
and said; yea it is the hand that shall keep promise with you, wherefore
fail not to come when I send for you: and saying so he went unto his lodging,
and she returned into her chamber rather dead than living, and spoke aloude
unto her women saying: Up my friends you have bin over sleepy for me; for
that I thinking to deceive you, have deceived my self: and saying so she
sounded and fell down in the middle of the Chamber. The poor women at that
cry rose up, much abashed to see their mistress lie upon the ground, and to
hear the words she spoke so that they knew not what to do, but only to find
means to recover her: and when she could speak, she said unto them: this day
(my friends) shall you see me the most miserable creature living on the earth;
and therewith showed them the cause, desiring them to help her, for that she made
full account to lose her life.

They thinking to comfort her, there came one of the Gentleman's servants, that
attended on him in his chamber, that told her his master had sent for her.
She there at (embracing two of her mayds began to weep) desiring them not to
let her go, seeing she was assured to die. But the page assured her the
contrary, and that he would venture his life, that the should have no hurt. She
perceiving that no resistance would serve, cast herself into her servants
arms, saying unto him, My friend, seeing it must be so, do thou ^ary this
unhappy body unto her death: and therewith, half dead with grief, she was
borne by the page into her husbands lodging, at whose feet the poor
Gentlewoman fell down, and said: Sir, I beseech you to have pity upon me, and
I swear unto you, of my faith, I will show you the truth of all. With that,
like a desparate man he said: By God you shall tell me the truth: and
therewith sent all his servants forth. And because he had found his wife to
be very devout, he thought she would not forswear herself, if that she swear
upon the cross: wherefore he called for a very fair Crucifire, that he had
borrowed, and they two being alone together, made her swear by it, that she
would tell him truth in whatsoever he should ask. But she that already had
past the first brunt of the fear of death, took comfort, determining before
she died, not to hide any thing from him, and also not to tell him any thing
whereby the Gentleman whom she loved, might sustain any wrong: and having
heard the questions he propounded, answered him, and said: I will not justify
my self, neither yet dissemble the love unto you I bear unto the Gentleman
whom you suspect, for that you neither can nor ought to believe it,
considering the experience that this day you have had, but I am very desirous
to show you the occasion thereof: wherefore, sir you must understand that never
any woman loved her husband so well as I love you, for that since I married you
until this time, there never entered any other love into mine heart then only
yours: you know that I being a child, my parents sought to marry me unto a
man of greater renown then yourselfe, yet could they never make me agree unto
it, after I once had spoken unto you, for that against al their minds I
remained constant, to have you, not respecting your poverty, my friends
instructions to the contrary: and you are not ignorant what interteinement I
have hitherto had of you, and how you have loved and esteemed me, whereby I
have had so much sorrow and grief, that without the help of my lady with whom
you placed me, I was in manner desparate: but in the end perceiving my self to
wax of more years, and of all men, except your self esteemed fair. I began
in such sort to feel the displeasure of the wrong you did me, that the love I
bare unto you, turned into hatred, and the desire to please you, changed into
revenge: and in this despair a prince resorted to me, who to obey the king
more then love, left me at such time as I began to feel the comfort of my
torments by an honest love: and leaving him, I found this Gentleman, that
needed not to entreat me, for that his beauty, honesty and virtues deserved to
be required and sought unto of all women of good judgment. At my request, and
not at his, he has loved me, with so honest a mind, that never in his life
did he require any thing of me contrary to mine honor. And although the small
love that I have cause to bear unto you, gave me occasion neither to show
faith nor loyalty unto you, the love which I only bear to God and to mine
honor, have hitherto preserved me from doing that, for the which I should need
any confession, or fear of shame. I will not deny, but that as often as
possible I could, I went to speak with him in a gallery, under pretense to go
to prayer, for that I never put my trust either in man or woman to be a means
therein. I will likewise not deny, that being in so secret a place, and out of
all suspicion, but that I kissed him with a better heart, then ever I kissed you,
but yet I never ask mercy at Gods hands, if that between us two there ever
was other kind of priuity, or ever he sought more at my hands, or that ever my
heart had other desire, for that I was so well pleased to see him, that me
thought there was no greater pleasure in the world. And you sir, that are the
only cause of my mishap, would you be redenged on a deed, where you your self
have so long time given me an example, yours being wholly without honor or
conscience? for you know and I am well assured, that she whom you love
contenteth not her self with that which god and reason commands. And
although the laws of man do attribute so great dishonor unto women, that love
other men besides their husbands, yet it is so, that the law of God does not
exempt the husband that loves other women then his wife: and if both our
offenses were put into a pair of balance it would soon be tried which were
heauiest: you are a man in years, wise and of good experience, to know and
understand how to avoid evil; I am young and wholly without experience to know
the force and power of love. You have a wife, that seeks, loves and
esteems you, more then her own life, and I have a husband that flies from
me, that hates and despises me, more then a poor servant. You love a woman
already in years, and of no great beauty, in respect of me, and I love a
Gentleman younger, fairer, and amiabler then you. You love the wife of one of
the greatest friends you have in all the world, on the one side offending the
Aunte, and on the other side the reverence you bear unto them both; and I love
a Gentleman that is not bound nor linked unto any, but only to the love he
bears me. Now sir I pray you without partiality to judge, which of us two is
most worthy of punishment or to be excused, I know not any man of experience,
but would lay the fault on you, seeing that I am young and ignorant, despised
and contenmed of you, and loved of the fairest and honestest Gentleman in
France, whom I love, being in despair never to be beloved of you.

The Gentleman hearing those speeches full of truth, and uttered with a
countenance so fair, together with so good a spirit, that thereby she showed
not any fear to have deserved punishment, found himself so surprised with
doubt, that he could make her no other answer, then only that the honor of a
man and of a woman make no less, nor yet all one, but that nevertheless
seeing she swear there was no sin between her friend and her, he determin^d not
to do her any hurt, so that she never used it again: and that neither he
nor she would ever call to mind their griefs and injuries forepast, which
she promised to observe; and with that they went to bed, as good friends. In
the morning an old Gentlewoman that was in great fear of her mistress life,
came unto her when she arose, asking her and said; well Madame how do you?
she answered her laughing, why sweet heart, there is not a better husband in
the world then mine, for he believed me upon mine oath. In that manner five or
six days passed over, wherein the Gentleman so narrowly watched his wife, that
both night and day, she had those that looked to her: but he could not watch
her so well but that she spoke unto him she loved in a very dark and
suspicious place. Yet she did it so secretly that neither man nor woman could
ever have known it, had it not been for a report that a seruingman gave forth
that he had sound a Gentleman and a Gentlewoman together in a stall under the
chamber of this Lady: whereat the Gentleman her husband had so great suspicion,
that he determined to kill the Gentleman, and to the same end assembled a great
number of his kinsmen and friends, that if they could find him in any place
to kill him: but his chief kinseman was so great a friend unto the Gentleman
whom he sought for, that in steed of taking him, advertised him what was done
against him: who on the other side was so well beloved in the court, and so
well accompanied that he feared not his enemies, so that he could not be found;
but being in a Church, went in to the mistress of his love, that never had heard
of any thing that had past, for that before her he never spoke unto her. The
Gentleman told her of the suspicion and hatred her husband bare unto him, and
that notwithstanding his innocence he was determined to absent himself by some
long voyadge, to avoid the suspicion already begone: the princes, mistress to
his friend, was much abasht to hear those speeches, and swear that the husband
did wrong to suspect so honest a woman as his wife, in whom she had never found
other then virtue and honesty. Nevertheless because of the authority of her
husband, and to quench suspicion, the princes counseled him to absent himself
for a certain time, assuring him that she would not believe any of her
husbands folies or suspicions. The Gentleman and the Gentlewoman her waiting
maid were very well content to remain in the good opinion and favor of the
princes, who counseled the Gentleman, that before his departure he should
speak with her husband, which he did, finding him in a gallery hard by the
Kings chamber, where with a bold countenance (giving him his due honor) he
said unto him. Sir, I have always had a great desire to do you service, and
for my labor I understand that the last night you sought to kill me, I
beseech you sir remember that you have more authority and power then I have,
yet I am a Gentleman as well as you, it would grieve me much to loose my life
for nothing: I beseech you likewise think that you have an honest woman, and
that if there be any man that will affirm the contrary, I will plainly tell
him that he lies, and for my part, I think I have not done any thing whereby
you should have cause to bear me ill will; wherefore if it please you, I am
your friend, if not I am the Kings, whereby I have occasion to content my
self. The Gentleman to whom he spoke said, that truly he had had some
suspicion of him, but that he accounted him so honest a man, that he would
rather desire his love, then otherwise; and bidding him farewell with his hat
in hand embraced him as his great friend. You may well think what they said,
which the night before had had commission for to kill him, when they saw so
great shows of friendship and love between them, whereof every man did
speak: with that the Gentleman departed: but because he was not so well
furnished of money as of beauty, his Lady gave him a jewel worth 3000.
crowns, which he laid to pawn for 1500. And not long after his departure the
married Gentleman went unto the chamber of the Princes, his wives mistress,
desiring her to give his wife leave for a time to lie at one of his sisters
houses: which the princes found very strange, desiring him to let her know the
cause, who told her part, but not all. After the young married Gentlewoman had
taken her leave of the princes, and of all the court without weeping or any
sign of grief, went unto the place where her husband had appointed, being in
the conduct of a Gentleman that had express charge to look carefully unto
her, and especially that as she rode in the way, she should not speak unto him
for whom he suspected her. She that knew her husbands straight commandment,
every day during their journey, gave them some alarm, mocking both them and
their negligent watch: and one day among the rest, as they went out of their
lodging, she found a friar on horseback, and she likewise on a gelding,
enterteined him from noone till night: and being about a mile from their
lodging, she said unto him, Father, for the good counsels and comforts you have
given me this afternoon, there are two French crowns which I give you, that are
within a paper because I know you dare not touch them, praying you that as soon
as you depart from me, you will gallop in all haste over the fields. And when
he was somewhat far off from the Gentlewoman, she spoke aloud unto her
servants, saying: Do you think your selves good servants, and careful of your
charge, when he whom ye are expressly commanded not to let speak with me has
been with me all this afternoon, and you never sought to hinder him: you
deserve that your master, which trusts so much in you, should give you
blows in stead of wages. When the Gentleman that had charge of her, heard
those speeches, he was in such a rage, that he could not speak a word, but
spurred his horse, and calling two of the men with him, did so much that they
ouertooke the friar: who seeing them come toward him, fied as fast as he
could, but because they were better horst then he they ouertook him, and he
that knew not wherefore, cried them mercy, and putting off his hood with more
humility to entreat them, they knew well it was not he they sought, and that
their mistress had mocked them, which she did much more at their return,
saying unto them: Such men as you, ought to have the keeping of a woman, for
when you have letten her speak you know not to whom, giving credit to her
words, you go and do injury to the servants of God. And after all these mocks,
she atriued at the place where her husband had appointed her to be, being by
her two sisters in law, and one of their husbands kept in great subjection.
Mean time her husband understood that her iewellay at pawn for L500. crowns,
for the which he was sorry: but to save his wives credit, and to have it
again, he told her that she should fetch it, and he would pay the 1500.
crowns. She that cared not for the jewel, seeing her friend had the money,
wrote unto him, how that her husband would constrain her to redeem the
jewel: and to the end he should not think she did it for want of good will,
she sent him a diamond that her mistress had given her, which she loved more
then any jewel she had. The Gentleman willingly sent her the merchants
obligation, and contented himself to have had 1500. crowns and a diamond, and
to be assured of his friends good will, although that as long as her husband
lived he had no more means to speak unto her but by letters. And after her
husbands death, because he thought her to be the same she always promised him,
he used all the means he could to have her in marriage. But he found that his
long absence had gotten her a friend whom she loved better: whereat he took
such grief, that shunning all Gentlewomen, he sought adventures, where he
obtained as much honor as any young Gentleman could have, and so ended his
days.

The thirteenth Novel.
A Gentlewoman of Millan tried the boldness and great courage of her lover,
for the which after that* she loved him perfectly.

IN the time of the great master du Chaumont, there was a Gentlewoman esteemed
one of the honestest women in her time living within the City of Millan, she
married an Italian Earl, whose widow she was, living in a house of her
husbands brethren* never caring or desiring to hear any speech of marying
again, behauing her self so wisely and so holily that there was not any
French man or Italian within that Duchy, which made not great account of her.
Upon a day as her brethren and her mother in law made a great feast for the
great master du Chamount, this Lady being a widow was constrained to be
there, which in other places she used not: and when the French men saw her,
they esteemed much her beauty and good grace, specially one whose name I will
not disclose: but it suffiseth you to know that there was not any Frenchman in
Italy worthier then he to be beloved; for that he was adorned with all the
beauties and good qualities a Gentleman may have: and although he saw this Lady
(being a widow) wearing a black sipres, separated from the younger Ladies,
and bearing company with the elder sort, as one to whom man or woman could
never procure fear, he began to entertain her, taking away his vizard and
leaving off to dance, that he might sit by her, and all that night left not off
to speak unto her, and the old ladies together, wherein he found more
pleasure then with all the brauest and youngest Ladies in the court, in such
manner, that when he should recite he thought he had had the leisure only to
sit down: and although he spoke not to this Lady, but only of common matters,
which might be spoken in such company, yet she perceived well he was desirous to
acquaint himself with her: so that she determined to abstain as much as
possible she might, in such manner that he could never after find her at any
feast or banquet: whereupon he enquired what her common exercises were, and
found that she often used to the Church and diverse religious houses, where he
made so good watch, that she could not go so secretly but he was there before
her, and that he stayed in the Church as long as he might have means to see
her, and that as long as he was there he beheld her with so great affection,
that she could not be ignorant of the love he bare her: which to avoid, she
determined for a time to feign her self sick, and to hear mass within her
house; whereat the Gentleman was so grieved as more he could not be, for that
he had no other means to see her but only as I said before: she thinking to
have broken off that custom, went unto the Churches as before she used to do,
which love presently made known unto the Gentleman who renewed his first
devotions, and fearing least she should find out some other means of
hinderance, and that he might not have the time to let her know his mind, one
morning as she thought her self well hidden within a little Chapel, where
she heard mass, he went and placed himself, at the end of the alter: and
perceiving that she had but small company, as the Priest held up the Corpus
Domini, he turned unto her, and wi^h a vnfi^ speech and great affection said
unto her: Madame, I take him whom the Priest holds in his hands for my
damnation, if you only be not the cause of my death, for although you take
from me, all means of speaking to you, yet can you not be ignorant of my
desire, seeing that truth sufficiently declares it unto you by my languishing
eyes, and dead countenance. The Lady counterfeiting not to know his meaning,
answered him and say^; God ought not to be served in this manner, but Poets do
commonly say, that Gods do laugh at the oaths and lies of lovers, wherefore
women that love their honors ought to be neither credulous nor pitiful. And
saying so she rose and went unto her lodging: if the gentleman was displeased
at those words they that have tried the like will say yea: but he that wa^ted
no courage, desired rather that hard answer, then to have failed to declare
his mind, which for the space of three years he held most constantly, and
both by letters and other means ceased not daily to solicit her: but during
three years space, he could never obtain other answer, but that she fled
from him, as the wolf does from the dogs, fearing to be taken, not for any
hatred she did hear unto him, but for the danger of her honor and reputa^^on,
which he perceived so well that more earnestly then before her followed his
suit: and after many pains, refusals, torments, and d^spaires, perceiving the
continuance of his love, this Lady had pity on him, and granted him that he
had so long and earnestly desired, and when they had agreed upon the means,
the French Gentleman failed not to hassard him self to go unto her house,
although his life thereby might be in great danger, because his kinsemen lodged
in the same house. He that had no less subtilty then beauty, behaved himself
so wisely, that he entered into her chamber at the time she had appointed,
where he found her alone lying in a rich bed, and as he made haste to put off
his clothes to go to bed unto her, he heard a great noise of men's voices
speaking softly, and of swords that struck against the walls.

The Lady with a face half dead said unto him, now at this time your life and
my honor are in the greatest danger that ever they were, for there I hear my
brethren which seek for you to kill you: wherefore I pray you hide you under
the bed, for when they find you not, I shall have an occasion to be offended
with them, for that without cause they have given me such alarm. The Gentleman
that as yet had never been afraid said unto her, and what are your brethren to
make an honest man afraid? if all the race of the^ were here in presence, I am
sure they would not stay the fourth blow that I should give, wherefore lie you
still, and let me keep the door: with that he wrapped his cloak about his arm,
and having his sword in hand, he went to open the door to see his enemies
weapons, whereof he heard the noise, and having opened it, he saw two maids
that had two swords in each hand, wherewith they gave him that alarm, which
said unto him, pardon us sir, for we have commandment from our misteris to do
so: but you shall have no more trouble by our means. The Gentleman perceiving
them to be weomen, could not do less then wish them at the devil, shutting
the door against them, and as soon as he could, went to bed unto the Lady,
whose fear had not in any thing diminished his love, and forgetting to ask
her the causes of her skirmishes, had no other thought but to satisfy his
desire. But perceiving day to appear, desired her to tell him why he had done
him that injury, not only in prolonging time, but also in that last
enterprise, she laughing answered him, saying: my determination was never to
love which sure my widdowe-hood I had always observed, but your honesty from
the time you spoke unto me, at the banquet made me, change opinion, and that I
began as then to love you as much as you loved me, it is true chst lone which
always guided me, would not permit that love should cause me do the thing
whereby mine honor should be ought impaired but as the hind wounded to death,
thinks in changing places, to change the evil which she hears in her body,
so I went from Church to Church thinking to fly that which I bare within my
heart, whereof I have made so perfect proof, that it has made mine honor to
consent unto my love, but to the end I might be well assured to place my love
and my heart in a perfect honest man, I thought to make this proof which my
maids have now effected, assuring you, that for fear of life or other
respect, I had found you fearful, so that you had hidden your self under my
bed, I was determined to have risen, and have gone into another chamber,
without ever seeing you more: but because I have found you fair, of good
grace, and full of virtue and hardines, more then was certifyed unto me, and
that fear could not overcome your heart, nor in any sort lessen the love you
bear unto me, I am dotermined to content my self with you, until I die,
being assured that I cannot put my life and honor into a better hand, then in
his, whose like for virtues I never found. And so as if the minds of men were
not mutable they swear and promised that which was not in their powers, that is
a perpetual amity, which cannot spring nor yet dwell in man's heart, and they
know it well, that have tried and known how long such opinions do continue.

The foureteenth Novel.
A poor simple country man, whose wife loved the Curate of the Church
suffers himself easily to be deceived.

IN the County of Maime, in a villadge called Arcelles there was a rich
husbandman, that in his age had married a fair young wench, that had no
children by him: but for the loss she had by him, till the recompensed her
self with other men, and when gentlemen and other good companions failed she
turned to her last relief, which was the Church, and made him companion of her
sin, that could obsolue her, which was the Curat, that oftentimes came to
visit his sheep. The husband being old and crasie, suspected nothing, but
because he was rude and churlish, his wife played her part as secretly as she
could, fearing that if her husband should perceive it, he would kill her. Upon
a day as he was abroad, his wife thinking he would come so soon again, sent
for the Curate to confess her, and as they made good there together, her
husband came in upon the sudden, whereby the Curate had not leisure to go unto
his house, but devised means to hide himself, and by the woman's counsel went
into a barn, and covered the stairs head where he went up with a fan of
corn, the husband being in the house; she least he should suspect her, made
him so good cheer to dinner, that she spared no drink, whereof he took so
much, that together with the wearines he had by laboring in the fields, he
fell a sleep, sitting in a chair before the fire. The Curate being weary to
be so long in the barn, hearing no noise in the chamber, went unto the stairs,
and thrusting out his neck as far as he could to look down, perceived the
good man to be a sleep, and looking earnestly upon him, leand so hardly upon
the fan, that both fan and he fell unto the ground, hard by the old man
that slept, where with he waked: the Curate that arose up sooner then the man
could open his eyes, said unto him there is your fan, and I thank you,
wherewith he went his way, and the poor man being abasht asked what it was:
she answered him, it is your fan that the Curate borrowed, and now has
brought it home, he grumbling said, do men use to bring home things they
borrowe in such rude manner, I thought the house would have fallen down, by
which means the Curate saved himself to the poor man's cost, that found fault
with nothing but that he brought his fan so rudely home.

The fifteenth Novel.
The strange fragilitie of man, that to cover his horror falls from evil to
worse.

IN the time of king Jews the twelfth, one of the house of Ambois nephew to
the legate of France named George, being legate in Auigneon, had in the country
of Languedoc a Lady, whose name I will not rehearse for her kinreds sake, that
had better than four thousand crowns yearly revenue: she being very young was
a widow, and had but one child, being a son; and for grief she had for the
loss of her husband, as also for the love of her son, determined not to
marry again. And to avoid all occasions would not use the company of any
other than religious persons, thinking that sin causes temptations, whereby
the young widow gave her self only to divine service, wholly forsaking worldly
company, in such manner that she made conscience to go to any wedding, or to
hear the Organs play within the church. When her son was seven years old,
she chose a man of zealous life to be his schoolemaister, by whose good means
he might be brought up in godliness. When her son entered into his fifteenth
year, Nature, which of it self is a secret Schoolemaister, finding him too
delicately nourished, and full of idleness, taught him an other lesson, than
his master used to do, for that he began to behold and respect things that
seemed fair; and among the rest a gentlewoman that lodged in his mothers
chamber, whereof no man ever doubted, for that they no more respected him, than
a young infant; no other thing being spoken of in the whole house but
godliness. This young gentleman began secretly to seek unto the maid that told
it to her mistress, who loved and esteemed her son so much, that she suspected
the maid to tell it her, only to make her hate him: but she was so
importunate with her mistress, that she said unto her, I will know if it be
true, and assure your self I will correct him if I find it to be so: but if
you tell me an untruth, I will make you feel the price thereof. And to find
the truth she willed her to appoint her son to come about midnight to lie
with her in a bed near unto the door of the chamber where the maid lay. The
maid obeyed her mistress: and when night came the Gentlewoman laid her self in
her maids bed, determining if it were true, to correct her son so well, that
never after he should desire to lie with maid again. And in that thought and
displeasure her son came to bed unto her. She, although she saw him lie
down, would not yet believe he would commit any dishonest art, but stayed to
speak with him, until she perceived some signs of bad desire: but not being
persuaded with so small a sign, that he would proceed further, was so long
pa^ient, and so frail of nature, that she converted her choler into a most
abominable pleasure, forgetting the name of mother: and even as water that by
force is holden in, when it issues forth, meketh more noise than that which
runs his ordinary course, so this poor lady turned her glory into the
restraint she gave unto her body. And when she proceeded to decline from the
first degree of honesty, she found her self suddenly carried and borne unto
the last; and the said night became with child by him, whom she sought to
keep from getting others with child. The same was no sooner committed, but
the remorce of conscience, brought her into into so great torment, that the
repentance never left her during her whole life, which at the first was so
sharp, that she rose out of the bed from her son, that knew no other but it
had bin the maid, and went into a closet, where calling her good determination
unto mind, and the wicked execution thereof, she passed all the night in weeping
and lamenting all alone: but in stead of acknowledging of the impossiblitie of
our flesh, that without Gods help, can not but sin, desiring by her self,
and by her tears to satisfy her fault past, and by her wisdom to avoid the
evil to come, she laid the excuse of her sin upon the occasion, and upon
the weakness of flesh and blood, whereunto there is no remedy but only by the
grace of God: she thought to do that, whereby in time to come she might not fall
into the like inconvenience, and as though there were but one kind of sin to
damn men, ^he devised all the means she could to avoid the same. Bu^ the
root of pride which external sin should heal, increase^ (...) her heart,
in such manner, that by avoiding one mischief she fell into diverse others: for
the next morning as son as it was day, she sent for her sons School
master and said unto him; Now my son begins to wax great, it is time to
send him abroad. I have a kinsman that dwells beyond the mountains with
Mousis the great master du Chaumont that will be very glad to have him in his
company, wherefore I pray you bring him thither: and to thend I be not grieved
with his departure, let him not come to take his leave of me. And saying so,
she gave him money to bear his charges for the voyage: and the same morning
caused the young gentleman to depart, that was very glad at nothing else than
after the inioying the pleasure of his love, to go unto the wars. The lady
continued long time in great melancholy and distress; and had it not bin for
the fear of God, she had often ^^shed the end of the vnfort^nat fruit she bare
within her bo^^. In the end she fained to be sick, that under that under th^^
(...) might cover her imperfection: and being re^dy to (...), remembering that
there was no man in the world in whom she so much trusted, as a bastard
brother of hers, whom she entertained and did him much good; she sent for him,
and showing him her hard fortune (but made him not acquainted that it was by
her son) desired him to help her, and to save her honor, which he did: and
not long before she should lie down, he gave her counsel to change the air,
and to go to his house, where she might sooner recover her health than in her
own. She went thither but with small train, and there she found a midwife
ready for her, that by night not knowing her, brought her to bed of a fair
daughter: the gentleman delivered it unto a nurse, and caused it to be nursed
for his own. The Lady having stayed there a month, went home unto her own
house, where after that she lived more strictly than ever she did, both in
fasting and discipline. But when her son became great, perceiving no war to
be in Italy, he sent to desire his mother that he might come see her: she
fearing to fall into the evil from whence she had escaped, would not permit
him, till in thend he was so importunate with her, that she had no reason to
deny him. Nevertheless she sent him word, that he should never come unto her,
if he were not married to a wife that he loved well; and that he should not
respect her riches, so she were honest, and it should suffice. In the mean
time bastard brother perceiving the daughter whereof he had the charge, to wax
great, and very fair, thought to place her in some house far off, where she
should not be known; and by the mothers counsel, gave her unto the Queen of
Navarre. This daughter named Katharine grew to the age of twelve or thirteen
years, and became so fair and honest, that the Q. of Navarre bare her good
affection, and desired much to mary her richly. But by reason she was poor,
she found her self to have suitors great store, but none that would be her
husband. Upon a day it happened that the Gentleman that was her unknown
father, returning from the other side of the Alps, went unto the Queen of
Nauarres house, where he had no sooner espied the maid, but he became amarous
of her, and because he had license of his mother to mary one that liked him, he
took no care but only to have a wife that pleased his fantasy, and knowing
her to be such, asked her in marriage of the Queen, that most willingly
consented as knowing the Gentleman to be rich, and with his riches both fair
and honest. The marriage being finished the Gentleman wrote unto his mother that
from thencefoorth she need not refuse him her house, for seeing he brought
with him as fair a wife as any could be found, the Gentlewoman that enquired
with what house he had matched himself, found he had married their own
daughter, wherewith she was in such despair, that he presently thought to die,
perceiving that ye more she sought to hinder her grief, the more she was the
means to increase the same. Whereupon not knowing what to do, she went unto
the Legate being at Auignion, to whom she confessed the greatness of her sin,
asking his counsel what she should do therein. The Legate to satisfy her
desire, sent for certain deuines, to whom he uttered the matter not naming the
persons, and found by their counsel, that the Gentlewoman ought not to make it
known unto her children, for that for their parts considering their ignorance,
they had not sinned, but that she during her life ought to do penance without
making any show thereof. Which done, the poor woman returned home, where not
long after arrived her son and her daughter in law that loved so well, that
never husband nor wife loved in better sort, for she was both his daughter,
sister, and wife, and he too her father, brother and husband; in which great
amity they continued long: and the poor Gentlewoman in her extreme penance,
that never saw them merry, but she withdrew her self to weep.

The sixteenth Novel.
Of a merry conceited Bricke-layer, that had a cursed queen to his wife, and of
that which happened.

IN the town of Bleare nere Aragon, there is a village called S. Mortis the
fair, where there dwelt a handsome propper fellow, as any in Paris, where he
was borne; and for his valor he durst have travailed into any Gentleman's
buttery, where all the barrels had been full, without either dagger or sword
about him. For his resolution, if he had once gotten under a maids chamber
window, he would never have started, till they had emptied a chamber pot on his
head. For his courage he durst have gone into any baudy house, and would have
come out again as honest a man as when he went first in. For his credit, he
might have run on the score for six pots with any Alewife that kept house
within five miles where he dwelt. For his qualities every manner of way, he had
the pre-eminence amongst all the youths that were in those quarters; for at
Maytide, who was the ringleader for the fetching home of a Maypole, but he? at
Midsummer he was chosen the Summer lord: at every bridal, who must dance with
the bride, but lusty Roger? Thus for a pleasant life, the Constable of Paris
lived not more merrily then he. And for his reputation, he was almost as much
reverenced as our Churchwardens. But as the stoutest stand of ale at last is
set on tilt, and the fattest goose comes soonest to the spitte; so his former
fortunes were drawn to the latest date, and his prime of pleasures concluded
with mishap. But oh love, oh cruel love, that was the first fruit to his
felicities. But who can resist love, if it be once crept into the bottom of a
man's belly? oh what a rumbling it makes in his gu^s, and how it bethrobs him
about the heart. And see now the sequel of his mishappe: he fortuned to be at
a sheepshearing, where he met with a pretty wench, named Sisly, in a fine red
peticoate, with damask upper bodies, a white apron before her: and upon her
head a broad felt hat, with a brave branch of rosemary sticking in her bosom,
appointed amongst the rest with a pair of sheares to help sheare sheep, and
he having brought forth a lusty young ram, would have laid him in her
lap; but she refusing to take him, said unto him: Now good friend Roger, if
you love me, bring me none but polde sheep; for of all things in the world, I
cannot abide these horned beasts. When he heard these mild words, that gently
spoken, and how kindly she pronounced this sentence (Good friend Roger, if you
love me) oh heavens (thought he) what a sweet charm is this? then noting her
modesty, that she could not abide the sight of an horned beast, he began to
think with himself, how happy might that man be accounted that could light of
such a wife. And having but a little given scope to his own affections, love
that had his tinder box ready to strike fire, by this time had set his fancy
of such a flame, that not longer able to endure the heat without a cup of
sack, he said unto her: Sister, your manner of phrase has wonderfully troubled
me: for in your first speeches you call me your good friend Roger, and then you
came in with a doubtful demand, in these words (if you do love me) as though I
could be your good friend, and yet did not love you: but Sisley, since you have
popt me such a doubtful question, if you and I were alone by our selves, I
would pop you such an answer, that you should well find that I loved you, and
that hereafter you might leave out your, If, and say Roger Ass you love me.

With these words, pretily casting her head at one side, she gave him such a
leering look, that might as well have danted him with despair, as gave him
comfort and hope of grace, for the one of her eyes was bleared, and seemed as
though she wept, the other was a pretty pinkeny, looking ever as though she
smiled, so that in her very countenance at one instance, you might easily
behold pleasure, and pain, pity, and rigor, courtesy and cruelty, love and
disdain; and then with a sweet voice, like one that were asking an alms, she
said: Roger, if you love me as you say, your love shall not be lost: but men
are so crafty now adays before they are married, that they will make a maid
believe they love her, till they have got up her belly, and then they will not
stick to deny their own children, and that makes women when they be once
married, to play their husbands such a cast, that they shall not know their own
children, but if your love be no such love, Roger, you shall not find me
unkind: when he heard the wisdom of the wench, it made his pulces so to
beat, that he had thought his codpisse point would have broken a sunder: but
for an answer he said.

Sisly, your sober speeches so wisely delivered, together with your sweet
countenance so lively placed, has so prevailed with your good friend Roger,
that for the better confirmation of my love receive here this token, as a
pledge of my good will, and taking then a twopenny piece which he had in his
purse, he bowed it and gave it unto her, the which when she had received, she
said.

Well Roger, now I do account you as mine own, and at night when my mother is
gone to bed, if you will come home, we will there talk further of this
matter: and for your welcome I will bestow of you a mess of cream.

Sisly, (said he) look you keep your promise, for I will be there, and because
you will be at so much cost with a mess of cream, I will bring with me a
penny worth of spice cakes: and although they had thus referred their further
speeches til their next meeting, yet during the time that they remained there
in place, many amarous glances, and loving countenances, there passed still too
and fro between them: but at night the appointed time being come, thither he
went, and Sisly, was at the window watching for his coming, who having once
espied him, she opened the door, where she received him with such a sweet
kiss, as if her breath had been lately perfumed for the purpose, whose dainty
smell was as savery, as if it had been a red herring that had been newly
roasted, her lovely lips pleasant and soft, like a lock of wool, that was but
then come out of the seame basket: but should I tell you of all the other love
tricks that passed betwixt him and her that night, I might either oppress your
stomachs to think of it, or otherwise perhaps make you ashamed to hear it.
But let this suffice, before they departed their marriage day was appointed, and
Sisly, in time made her mother acquainted with the matter, who nothing
misliking of her daughters choice, gave her her blessing, with many other good
helps to furnish forth her bridal day: the which when time had drawn to be
solemnized, and that the lusty youths of the parish were gathered together to
go with us to Church, and the young damsels were flocked on a heap to wait on
the bride, attending her coming forth, the good old woman her mother, who
had been ever chary of the lovely chickin her daughter, and even at the very
instant when we were ready to go to church, she was schooling of her with this
exhortation.

Sisly (said she) the day is now come which you have so much longed after, it
is twenty years ago since you first wished for a husband, and byrlady
daughter, you were then seventeen or eighteen years of age, so that at this
present you want not above two or three of forty: now if wit went by years,
you are old enough to be wise: but I being your mother, besides my many
years, which might advance my skill: so I have buried four several husbands
(the heavens he praised for it) which has so much the more confirmed my
experience in the dispositions of men, and can the better judge of their
natural inclinations: and by all that I have gathered by my own proof and
practice, I have found it still by trial, that the fantasies of men, are ever
best fitted with the follies of women: but leaving generalities, and to come to
so much as concerns but thy self, thou art now to be married to a husband,
who in respect of his age thou might be his mother: and could thou now but
consider, what a comfort it is for an old woman, to be embraced by a young man,
O daughter daughter, thy mothers mouth begins to water, but with the very
imagination to think of the pleasure, and therefore happy may thou deem
thy self, that art so likely to enjoy it.

But here is now agreat piece of discretion to be used, for as age conceiueth
such contentment with the society of flesh and pleasant youth, so youth will
quickly fall a loathing of old and crooked age, if the parties be not wise to
enforce that by art, that they are otherwise deuaied by nature: which is, to
show a youthful disposed mind how far soever they be spent in years, for
it is a tired jade that cannot cry we he, and a sorry mare that cannot wag
her tail: thou art now to consider the inequality of the years between thy
self and thy husband: and therefore a little to whet him on to make him to
like the better of thee, it shall not be a miss for thee to show some
youthful conceit, especially being thy bridal day, it is tolerable for thee
a little to play the wanton. I tell thee daughter, men are well pleased to see
their wives youthfully given, as there is nothing does more delight them, then
to see them wantonly disposed: and this is the means to win your husbands
liking, and to draw him to that appetite, which your many years might quench,
remember therefore what I have told you, and fail not for your advantage, to
show some youthful trick.

Sisly, making a manerly courtesy, said: yes forsooth mother, I will remember
all that you have told me: by this time all things being prepared, to Church
they went, where the Priest having once done his office, they returned again,
and were accompanied with her neighbors and friends that went home to dinner
with them, for whom there was provided furmentie, and minced pies, besides
other good meats both roast and sad, the which being all ready, Sislie was
placed at the upper end, between two of the most substantial honest men
according to the custom of the parish and himself likewise (as the manner was)
did wait that day at the table with a napkin hanging on his shoulder.

But o what a comfort it was unto him, to see how dainetily Sisly fed of every
dish that came to the table, and how lustily she laid about her for her
victuals, and (though he) if it be true as some men say, that a good feeding
horse will go through with his labor, then I warrdnt you if I give Sislie her
meat, I need not fear to ride her where I list: but dinner being almost at
an end, and the cakebread and cheese ready to be set on the table, the good
old woman her mother who had likewise been very busy that day in taking
pains to fill the pots, and to carry away empty dishes, began to cheer up the
company, bidding them welcome, and telling them she was sorry there was no
better cheer for them.

Sislie, presently upon the sight of her mother, bethought her self what she
had to do, and calling now to mind what lesson she had given her, and how she
had willed her that day to show some youthful trick, thereby to purchase the
favor of her husband, and picking out at that very instant a sit opportunity
to perform it, she called to her mother, in this youthful manner, Mamma, up
and cack, the old woman hearing her daughter, said: why how now Sislie, fie for
shame, will you speak bugs words? could you not pretily have said I pray you
mother have me up to pick a roase, nay now I see you play the wanton too
much, then speaking to the company that sat by, she said: I pray you bear
with my daughters childishnes, for I know it is the furmentie that does so much
annoy her, for even from her infancy, if she had taken any spoone meat, she
was still troubled in the bottom of her back side with a great ventosity.

The neighbors seeing the cleanelinesse of the wench, did ever after that call
her by the name of manerly Sisly. Let this suffice: within a very few months
after he was married, Sisly began to grow ielous: for if she had bin once
thirsty, and that he wanted money to send to the alehouse, she would tell him
that he spent away his thrift amongst some other young queanes. Here began our
first falling out: and to set forward the matter, there dwelt at the very next
house by him a Tailor that had a wife, who was sure once a day to measure the
breadth of her husbands shoulders with his own metyarde.

Sisly and this Tailors wife grew to be acquainted: and amongst other
conclusions it was agreed between them, that to prevent diseases, and to
preserve them in health, they would every morning next their hearts, take a
physical diet, which was, a full quarte of the quintessence drawn from an Ale
tub, warmed by the fire, with a grated nutmeg, half a yeard of black pudding
roasted, a quantity of salt, with a measure of fine wheat flower, first made
into paste, and after baked in a loaf of bread: these ingrediences after they
had incorporated together, they would afterward lightly fast till noone: and
they found such a commodity in using the medicine, that if the Tailor and he
had not every morning given them money to pay for the simples, it had not been
good for them to come that day after in their sights; for the Tailors wife she
could handle a metyeard or a cudgel passing nimbly. But Sisly had gotten the
practice of all manner of weapons; and besides that, she had the use of her
nails, which she employed many times about my face: she could likewise handle
a pair of bellows about my pate, a pair of tongues a thwart my shinnes, a
firebrand sometimes should fly at my head, a ladle full of scalding liquor
otherwhiles in my bosom, a three footed stool, a pot, a candlestick, or any
other thing whatsoever came next her hand, all was one to her; and she had
learned such a dexterity in the delivery, that they should have come
whirling about my ears. But in thend, he devising with himself a remedy for
these mischiefs, he found means to be made the Constable, hoping that his
office would have bin a protection to him for a year, and that she durst not
have stricken her Majesty's Officer. But within a day or two, it was his
fortune to find out a pot of strong ale, which she had set up in a corner for
her own drinking; and he (being thirsty) gave it such a soope, that he left
very little behind; the which afterward when she came to seek for, and found
her store so pitifully impaired, against his coming home at night, she
provided her of a waster: and he was no sooner entered the doors, but forth
she comes with her cudgel in her hand, and with such a terrible countenance,
that were able to affright any man that should behold it.

Roger (said she) I had thought you would never have given me occasion to be
jealous of you; but now I see you love a cup of strong ale better than you love
me: and do you not think then that I have great reason to be displeased with
your unkindness toward me, and to beat out that lack of love that causes
you so lightly to regard me? Sisly (said he) take heed what you do, for you
know that I am her Majesty's Officer, and here I charge you in the Queens name
that you hold your hands. What master Constable (said she) have you gotten an
enchantment for me? or do you think that your charm shall serve to excuse
you? No sure, no, for now you have deserved double punishment: first, you being
an officer, if you offer wrong, your punishment must be so much the more
grievous: and is it not mere injustice to take that which was not provided for
you? Next, you have deserved to be well punished, for the little reverence you
have used in the execution of your office, commanding me in the Queens name
to hold my hands with your cappe on your head, nor using any other duty or
reverence. But master Constable, I will teach you how to use an office: and
with that she let fly at his head, shoulders, and arms, and would still
cry, Remember here after how you do your office, remember your duty to the
Queen; remember when you do command in her Majesty's name, that you put off
your cap, and do it with reverence; and such a number of other remembrances she
gave him, as (I think) there was never poor Constable before nor since, so
instructed in an office as he was. To tell of many other like remembrances
which at other times she bestowed on him, would be but tedious: but the
conclusion is, he is now rid of her, she being dead, heel keep himself a
widower (for her sake) as long as he lives.

The seventeenth Novel.
Mahomet one of the Turkish Emperors, executes cursed cruelty upon a Greek
maiden, whom he took prisoner at the winning of Constantinople.

IF you do ever make any proof or trial, to know of what trampe the arrows
of love be, and what fruit they bring to them that do use and practice the^, I
am assured you shall be touched with some pity when you understand the beastly
cruelty of an Infidel lover toward his Lady. He of whom I will declare the
history is Mahomet, not the false prophet, but the great grandfather of Soliman
Otiman Emperor of the Turks, which reigned at that time: he it is that to the
shame and eternal infamy of all Christian Princes of his time, did win
Constantinople, and took away the East empire from Constantine, a Christian
emperor. Mahomet then having obtained so great a victory at Constantinople,
among the spoils of that rich city, there was a fond Greek maiden, of such
rare and excellent beauty, as she allured the eyes of every wight to wonder and
behold her, as a thing miraculous, whose name was Hyerenae, of the age of
sixteen or seventeen years, whom a Captain to gratify his Lord did
present: a jewel (as he thought) most acceptable unto him, above all things
of the world. The emperor Mahomet, young and wanton beyond measure, after that
he had cast his eye upon the young maiden, and had graven her beauty in his
heart, gave a straight charge that she should be kept for him, hoping after the
tumult of the war was ended, to bestow convenient time upon her. The retreict
sounded, and the affairs of the empire reduced to sure estate, remembering
himself of the beauty of Hyerence, which had made a breach and entry into his
heart, commanded that she should be brought forth unto him, and having viewed
her at his pleasure, he felt himself surprised with the new flame, that he
conceived no other delight, but to play and dally with her, in such sort, as
his spirits being in loves full possession, love dealt with him so cruelly, as
he could take no rest day nor night, who yielded himself such a pray to his
darling Hyerence, that he felt none other contentation in his mind, but that
which he received of her. And this amorous passion endured the space of three
years, taking such vigor and increase by little and little, that he began
to forget that which apperteined to the ornament and honor of his empire,
leaving the whole administration of public causes unto his Baschats, he
himself being so negligent, as he reposed in them all matters concerning the
state of the empire. During this disorder, the vulgar people began secretly to
grudge, as well for the confusion and disorder of the empire, as for the ill
government of the same (and specially because the Baschats corrupted with
avarice, employed themselves to the particular profit, and to enrich themselves
with the spoil of the people:) the Ianisaries on the other side a warlike
people, and brought up in continual exercise of arms, began with open voice
to detract and slander their lord, commonly complaining how he consumed his
life like an effeminate person without inferring or doing any profit to the
empire. To be short, the matter came to such desolation, as it might rather
have been called a sedition, then a murmr: and yet there was none so hardy,
as durst attempt to declare the same to the emperor, knowing him to be of
nature terrible, cruel and rigorous, that with a word would put him to death
that went about to withdraw him from his desire: so that he was so drunk
with the beauty of the Greek, that the least matter wherewith they might give
occasion to withdraw him from his negligent life, was enough to draw him into
rage and fury. This poor emperor was so bewitched, as not only he consumed
days and nights with her, but he burned with continual jealousy, whose beauty
was so lively painted in the inward parts of his mind and heart, that he
remained thus overwhelmed in beastly pleasure. Every man in particular, and all
in general conspired against him with one determinate mind, to yield no more
obedience unto him in time to come, and purposed to choose some emperor that
were more warlike and martial, through whose succor and counsel they might
not only conserve the things gotten, but amplify the bounds and limits of
their empire. Mustapha which was brought up with the emperor, a gentle
personage, frank of talk, and so near to his majesty, that he might go into
his chamber although ye Greek was present: when he perceived convenient time,
such as he desired to have, repaired to the emperor upon a day, who liking well
of his devices, walked alone with him into his garden: to whom after he had
made great reverence, according to their custom, he said: My sovereign lord
and master, if I might speak freely, without servile fear, which stays me,
or if ye terror of your displeasure might not abash me, I would willingly
declare unto your majesty that which concerns not only your security and
sauegard, but (which is more) the safety of your whole empire. Whom Mahomet
answered with merry countenance, in these words: Cast away such cold fear as
stayth thee, and speak hardly thy mind, show me what it is that touches me. I
doubt, and it shall please your majesty, lest I shall seem over presumptuous,
and rash, if Idiscouer the secrets of my heart; but over ancient education, the
duty of my conscience, with the experience that you have always had of my
fidelity, have so much forced me, as being no longer able to rule my self, I
am constrained (by what virtuous provocation I know not) to manifest things
unto you, that both time and necessity will make you think them good and
necessary: although (it may so be) that now your eyes be so bound up in the
veil of your disordinate affection, that you can not digest or take the same
in good part. The life (my lord) which you have led since the taking of
Constantinople, and the excessive pleasures wherein you have been plunged these
three years; is occasion, that not only your soldiers, and the rest of your
popular people, but the most faithful lords of your empire, do murmr,
conspire, and conjure against you: and pardon me (my lord) if I speak so
irreverently in things touching your preservation, for there is no man, but
does very much marvel of this great and new alteration that appears in
you, which does so abase you, and makes you to degenerate from your ancient
generositie and valiance: your self has given over your self to be a spoil
and pray to a simple woman, that you wholly depend upon her flatteries and
allurements; reason or counsel can take no place in your passionate and
afflicted heart: but I humbly beseech your majesty to enter a little into your
self, and make a survey of your life that you have led these three years past.
The glory of your ancestors acquired and come by so much shedding of so much
blood, kept by so great prudence, conserved by so happy counsel, have they no
representation or show before your face? the remembrance of their memorable
victories, does it not touch the depth of your conscience? the magnanimity
and valiance, whereby they be immortalized, and their fame registered through the
whole world, is it extinguished in you? their trophies and momuments gotten,
and advanced to all the corners of the earth, be they thrown down and
defaced, from the siege of your remembrance? But where is now the ardent desire
which boiled in you from your infancy, to make Italy tributarie unto you, and
to cause your self to be crowned at Rome, emperor as well of the Orient as of
the Occident? this is not the way to amplify and enlarge your empire, but
rather to restrain and diminish the same: this is not the way to preserve it,
but to spoil it, and to make it less. If Ottomon the first Turk or stock of
your gentle family and kindred, had thus given himself to be corrupted in
idleness, you had not now inherited the noble kingdom of Greece, nor governed
the countries of Galatia and Bithinia, and many other provinces, which inuirone
the great sea. Semblably his son Orcan (a lively image of his father, and a
follower of his valiant facts, had not triumphed over Licaonia, Phrigia, Caria,
nor dilated the bounds of his empire, to Hellesponte. What shall I speak of
Amurates the successor of Orcan, who was the first that invaded Europa,
conquered Thrafia, Siria, Rasia, and Bulgaria. and Bajazet likewise, did not he
cut off the head of the great Tamberlaine, which called himself the scourge of
God, and brought into the field four hundredth thousand Sithians a horseback,
and six hundredth thousand footmen? shall I pass over with silence the
courteous exploites of your grandfather, Mahomet, who conquered Masedonia, and
made the countries to feel the edge of his sword, even to the sea Tonicom,
letting pass many wonderful expeditions and iornies, by him made against the
Lidians, and Scicillians: but now I cannot revive the memory of your father
Amurate, but to my great sorrow and grief, who by the space of forty years,
made the sea and earth to tremble and quake and with the fury of his strong
hand, used such cruel revengment over the greeks, that the memory of the
wounds do remain at this day, even to the mountains of Thomao, and Pindus,
he subiugated the Phecians: made tributarie Athens, Boetia, Aetolia, Caramania,
and all the barbarous nations, from Morea, to the straites of Cornitte, what
need I here to bring in the cruel battle that he fought with the Emperor
Sigismounde, and Phillippe Duke of Burgundia, wherein he ouerthrewe the whole
force of the christians, took the Emperor prisoner, and the Duke of Burgundia
also, whom he sent to Andrionopolis; or to remember other fierce armies which
he sent into Hungaria, whereof your Majesty is a faithful witness, your self
being still there in your own person.

Judge then my Lord what diligent and intolerable travel he used in his
manifold glorious enterprises, and famous victories, do you think that if he
had been idle in his palace, amongst the Ladies you had inherited your Empire
or had now been Lord of so many provinces; which he is not sufficient to
rule, that cannot provide to confirm, and establish the same: there be many of
your subjects and vassals at this day, that do obey and honor your Majesty,
more for fear, than good love they bear you, that would rebel against you, if
fortune would turn her back. The christians of long time (as you know) have
sworn your ruin and destruction: moreover they say that their high bishop the
Pope of Rome, has conuocated al his prelates to unite, and reconciled the
princes and monarchs of christendom together to ouerrun you, and to take the
scepter out of your hands, and to dispoile you of your empire, but what know we
whether they will join their forces with the power of the Persian Sophi, your
capital enemy, or with ye souldan of Egypt, your ancient adversary, which if
it come to pass (as god forbid) your Empire will be consumed: gather your wits
then together, from henceforth my Lord and call again reason, which so many
years you have banished away from you: awake out of the deep sleep, that
has sealed up your eyes, imitate and follow the steps of your ancestors which
ever loved better one day of honor then a hundredth living years of shame and
reproach, attend to the government of your empire, leave off this effeminate
life, receive again the smell of your generositie and virtue, and if you
cannot at one time cut off and remove all that amarous heat, which undermines
so your heart, moderat the same by little and little, and give some hope to your
people, which think you to be utterly lost, and desperate of recovery, or if
so be the greek do so much delight you, who shall let you to carry her with
you in all your iornies and expeditions? why, cannot you both enjoy her beauty
together, and use the practice of arms? me think that your pleasure shall be
greater after you have won some victory, and subdued some country, to enjoy
her in your arms, then to remain in a house with eternal infamy, and
continual grudging of your subjects: but prove I pray you, to separate your
self certain days from her, and you shall certainly judge, how far more
passing, the pleasure be so deferred, then those that be daily used: yet one
thing more, and it please your Majesty, there rests to be said, which is,
that all the victories of your progenitors, or the conquests, which your self
has made, be to small purpose if you do not keep them, and increase them, the
keeping of a thing gotten, being of no less glory and praise, than the
conquest: be now then a conqueror of your self, humbly beseeching your
Majesty, that if I have spoken any thing, disagreeable to your mind,
according to your wonted clemency to pardon the same, and to impute the fault
to my bounden duty, and the care that I have of your honor and safety.
Mahomet, after he had heard the long discourse of this slave, stood as still as
a block, and fixing his eyes upon the ground, with sudden change of color,
declared by outward signs, the cogitations and unquietness of his mind in such
wise, as the poor slave Mustapha, seeing in him those alteratio^s, was in
doubt of his life; whose words so pricked ye Emperors heart, that he knew not
what to do, or whereupon to be resolved: and feeling his concience troubled
with a furious battle, knowing evidently that Mustapha had spoken the truth,
and that he uttered the same like a trusty servant to his master: but on the
other side the beauty of the greek was still before his eyes, and the mind he
had to abandon her, gave him such alarm, that he seemed at that instant, as
though his heart had been torn out of his belly, and thus moved with diverse
tempests, and disquieted with sundry thoughts, having his eyes inflamed with
great rage and fury, he said unto him: although thou have spoken irreverently
enough, yet our education together, and the fidelity that I have proved in
thee in time past shall be thy pardone for this time. To the purpose; before
the sun does compass the Zodiac, I will let it be known to thee and other,
what puissance and power, gouernes me, whether I am able to bridle mine
affection or not; take order in the mean time, that all my noble men, the
Baschats, and the principal of my men of war, be assembled together to morrow
in the midst of the great hall of my palace. This determination finished, the
Emperor went into the gre^ke with whom he reioiced all that day and night,
and made more of her then ever he did before; and the more to flatter her, he
dined with her, and commanded that after dinner, she should adorn herself
with her best jewels, and deck her with the costliest apparel she had:
whereunto the poor wench obeyed, not knowing that it was her funeral garments:
on the other side Mustapha uncertain of the Emperors mind at the hour
appointed, caused all the nobility to be assembled in the hall, every of them
maruailing what moved ye Emperor so to do, since he had so long time shut up
himself, without showing his person abroad: being thus assembled, and every
man talking diversely of this matter, according as the affection served: behold
the Emperor entered the hall, leading the Greek by the hand, who being adorned
otherwise than she was wont to be, was accompanied and garnished with beauty,
so rare and excellent that she resembled rather an heavenly Goddess, then a
human creature: the Turk being come into the hall, after that the Lords had
made their reverence, according to the woonted manner, he holding still the fair
greek and the left hand, and stood still in the midst of the same, looking
furiously round about him, he said unto them. So far as I understand, all
you do mutine and grudge, because I (being vanquished with love) cannot be
divided, nor yet content my self day nor night from the presence of this
greek: but I do know none of you all so continent, and chaste in love, that
if he had in possession, a thing so rare and precious, so amiable, endowed with
beauty so excellent, but before he could forget her, and gitie her over, he
would three times be well advised. What say you to the matter* every of you
shall have free livertie, frankly to tell me your mind: but they rapt with
an incredible admiration, to see so fair a thing, said that he had with great
reason passed his time with her. Whereunto the barbarous cruel prince
answered: well, now then I will make you to understand, that there is no
earthly thing that can bind up, or captiuate my senses so much, but that from
henceforth I will follow the glory, of mine ancestors, and imitate the
valiance of the Ottomans, which is so fixed in my breast, as nothing but death
is able to blot it out of my remembrance. Those words finished, incontinently
with one of his hands, he catched the Greek by the hair of the head, and
with his other hand, he drew forth his falchion from his side, and folding
his hands about her golden locks, at one blow, he struck of her head, to the
great terror of them all* when he had so done, he said unto them: Now ye
know, whether your Emperor is able to repress, and bridle hi^ affec^ions, or
not. Within a while after, meaning to discharge the rest of his choler, he
adressed a camp of four score or an hundredth thousand men: with whom piercing
Bossiue, he besieged Belgrade, where fortune was so contrary unto him that he
was put to flight, and lost there a notable battle against the christians,
under the conduct of John Huniades, surnamed le Blancke.
