AN Exhortation to the Bishops to deal Brotherly with their Brethren.
ALthough both through lack of learning and experience / I be far short in
ability / to exhort or dehort in any respect / especially sithe the matter
does concern those that are or should be both well learned and experienced
themselves / and thereby understand more then I can advise: yet being grieved
in conscience / and somewhat I find in you blame worthy / and seeing you bend
not your knowledge to amend that in you is amiss: pardon me though I presume
to admonish you in brotherly sort / as my slender skill will permit. But justly
it may be objected to me that there are many far more fit and able / then I
to deal in such a matter / and sith they do not / it may be thought great
arrogancy in me to intermeddle in the same: In deed my want of ability / as
before / so again I confess / and the great plenty of others that are far
more able / I must needs acknowledge / and withal my heart I wish better
wills in men added to their skill / then (the Lord knows) are to be found
amongst us: as for arrogancy to be imputed to me in this case / surely I hope
there shall not / for / God is my witness / I only seek to discharge my
conscience in showing my dislike of that / wherein as I think you deal scarce
brotherly. If any good fall out hereby I shall be glad / and praise God for the
same / if none / yet have I satisfied mine own conscience in uttering my
mind. Thus much for excuse / now to the matter. I understand / beloved in
Christ / of a certain book lately published abroad by some of our brethren /
the matter whereof as it is much misliked / so is the manner not well allowed of
/ and both so evil taken as our poor brethren for the same feel the pain
and punishment of most heinous offenders: if their fault be great yet they are
our brethren / and therefore by you ought somewhat to be regarded / if it be not
great / as they are our brethren / you not regarding them / are greatly to be
blamed. And surely for my part I think your duty were to discover unto the
world by ye warrant of the word / how truly or falsely they have written /
which if you would do in symplicitie of conscience / then perhaps their fault
would not be so grievous as you make it / wherein I durst appeal unto your
own conscience if the matter did not touch you so nearly as it does. For I
pray you examine their case with me a little: they put forth a Book in the
time of Parliament / wherein they disclose the disorders of our church of
England / and humbly desire a Reformation of the same according to the rule of
Gods word: is this an innovation? they say there ought to be no Lordlinesse
in the ministry: Bishops livings ought to be abated: their great circuites
cut shorter: and them selves made equal to their brethren: is this to
overthrow a whole state? they say the Book of common Prayer is full of
corruptions / they mislike with our unlearned ministry / they find fault
with our disorderous Discipline / and put down their opinions how these
things may be reformed: is this intolerable? their Book stands on many
points needelesse here to be rehearsed / and if in any part thereof they show
such contemptuous disobedience toward our sovereign as some seek to
enforce / none shall think them more worthy punishment then I: but to seek
reformation of deformities in Gods church / to say the Bishops should be
vnlorded and abridged of their huge livings / and to crave that all deformities
may be cut of and corrected by the prescripte rule of Gods holy word / is to
seek the furtherance of Gods honor and glory / and therefore great blame worthy
are they that so seek to aggrauate the matter / in charging them with
disobedience to her Majesty / as though to honor the almighty / were to
dishonor the Prince. I marvel that men of learning professing christian
religion / will contrary to their profession deal so vnchristianlye with their
brethren: surely in my iudgemnt these be very slender arguments to say / these
men desire a reformation / therefore they seek innouations / as though it
were so strange a matter to have a church reformed / it is as weak an
argument to say they would have Bishops vnlorded / their livings abated / the
ministry brought to his right course / and true discipline restored /
therefore they would overthrow the whole state. A third reason is used / as
fond and feeble as the rest: and that is / that their dealing is intolerable /
surely what it is to innouate in your sense I know not / but sure I am / there
can be no innovation found in that motion that has any part of Gods word to
warrant it. For that is far more ancient then the disorders of our church /
or any order devised by man / and till our disorders be removed and Christ his
ancient orders set in place / till we cease to be guided and ruled by men /
and yield to be directed by the word of God / I can not hope of any great good
in our congregations. As for overthrow of the whole state truly England were
in a strange case / if the state thereof / either in increase or decay /
depends upon the maintenance or overthrow of the Bishops Lordships and
livings. And as for your argument of intollerablenesse / in deed in one sense
it may hold true / and that is in that your selves will not tolerate their
dealings herein / but aggrauate their cause to make it seem more grievous in the
sight of men / otherwise I see no reason how (justly) their doing may be
thought intolerable / for it may be counted tolerable that Gods word does
allow. But whether their book agree or disagree with the word of god / I
mean not to deal / leaving that to be judged by the learned / as for me /
according to my grief conceived / I mind to exhort you to Bishoply and
brotherly dealing with these yt are (although you bear the titles and names
of Lord and Lords grace) fellow pastors and preachers of ye eternal word of
God / together with you. In deed my purpose tended somewhat further / but that is
cut off by a contrary report that I have heard / and therefore leaving this as a
thing needelesse to be rehearsed I proceed to the matter in hand: Your
brethren are in prison and have been these many days for the book before
named / and which of you all since their emprisoning has opened his mouth to
speak one word for their delivery? nay / which of you has not inueighed
bitterly against them by word / since the publishing of that book? They have
been dealt as close prisoners a long time / so yt no friend / no not skarce
their wives may come to them / and which of you all have sued for their further
liberty? nay which of you all has not been ready to hinder their liberty
sought for by others? They have lien long at great charge / and are very pore
and needy / and which of you all has opened your pursse to relieve them? if
any of you have (though it be your duties) I must needees commend him or
them: if none of you / as it is your duties / I must needs condemn you. A
lamentable case that Lording should so lead away ye hearts of the learned /
that they forget their duties in their calling: for see how foully you forget
your selves: Papists lie abroad in your diocesses untouched / in contempt of
the truth and her Majesty's laws / refuse to frequent divine service and
sermons / and yet if any honest man present them unto you / a favorable
speech or letter of some worshipful (though not very godly) in the Shire /
shall easily obtain their dispatche. But if any of our brethren strive or
endeavor them selves zealously to further the building of Gods temple / and to
procure reformation of things amiss / it is easelye seen by these / what
help they should have at your hands / and if a christian brother make suit
for him / favor is hardly obtained / or not at all / if it fall out
otherwise / by this I shall be glad and yield my self faulty in saying thus
of you. Many lewd light books and ballades fly abroad printed / not only
without reprehension / but cum priuilegio / the authors and printers whereof
continue daily amongst us without controlment / and yet the Lord by his holy
scriptures forbids all filthy communication / and therefore writing: but if
any of our brethren put in Print any book of a godly zeal / that tends to
the furtherance of Gods glory and sincerity / and urges a reformation of
things amiss / he is new fangled / he is not friend to Caesar / he is to be
removed from amongst the people. Alas dear brethren what has so bewitched
and blineded you / that you can not perceive / and see your own evil dealing
herein? if the title of Lordship / cast it off / if your huge livings /
forsake them: be not so wrapped in the desire of worldly things / that you
neglecte your duties in your vocation and calling: I can not think so well of
you / but that I must needs say you neglect your duties: I think surely
there is none of you but would be glad to see reformation of things amiss /
for some of you I know have said so / neither can you deny but that many
things are out of order in our Church of England / even many things that they
make mention of in their book: what then moves you to make their offense so
grievous in the sight of the world / or rather why do you not allow that is
good in their book / seeing they seek reformation thereby of that you would
gladly see reformed your selves: surely I think (to speak my conscience) that
there are some things in the book / which gladly you would have omitted / that
hinders your liking of the rest / and that is the inueying against your
Lordships and livings / for most of you would be glad to have all remnauntes of
Popery / superstition / and Idolatrye utterly removed / but none of you would
willingly lose his Lordly dignity and living / Hinc illae lachrymae against
your pore brethren / hence rises your dislike / this is ye cause you seek not
their deliverance / liberty and release / you would be glad of a reformation /
but you would not be reformed your selves / but in these things / there is but
one truth or falshode. If they hold the truth / why the^ resist you it in
these private respects to please your selves? if their opinion be false /
show the reason and then will we believe you / but wrest not the word to
satisfy your own fancy / and whether your honors and Lordships stand or
fall / let not the holy scriptures lose their due dignity and reverence. It is
a lamentatable thing to behold how (to make their own matters good) men will
in these days mangle ye scriptures of God / but the Lord will not be so
dallied with all / how so ever they please to dally with the simple men of the
world / and he will be revenged on you for neglecting to see this foul fault
redressed. But to my purpose our brethren lie in prison / where besides their
bonds they lack liberty of enioyinge the company of their friends / and have
great need to be relieved: let them in some sort find you careful and
mindful of them / travail for their delivery / if that will not be obtained
/ yet endeavor to procure them some further liberty / if neither will be had
/ forget not to releue them. Their book is out and cannot be called back
again / if it may be justified by the word of truth / take heed yt by you the
truth be not betrayed / try it by the touch stone / examine it by the word /
set al affections aparte / think it no disgrace to come down from your Lordly
dignities / if the word of the Lord will have it so. Feed not your own
fantasies / but follow the word / and think not scorn to be controlled by the
same word / out of whose mouth so ever it come. Balaam was a Prophet of ye Lord
/ yet at one instant his Ass taught him a better lesson than he could teach
him self / I am not to teach you / neither mean I so to take upon me / only
I exhort you to deal Bishoply and brotherly / and let no vain love of Lorldly
dignity make you careless of your brethren / who wish you good in the Lord /
though they would be glad you were vnlorded / not for malice / but because
scripture allows no such title to a Bishop. If passionate affection shall so
carry you away / yt because your Lordlinesse is touched / you will therefore not
deal so / but against your brethren I know not what others will conceive
thereof / but for my part (to speak as I think) I must needs doubt / your
Lordlinesse has made you utterly to forget what ought to be in a Bishop. If
they do hold any error or behave themselves licenciously and losely / or
neglected their vocation / I were easily put to silence / but in doctrine they
are sound / in life not to be touched / that ever I heard / and were diligent
in their calling: why then should you so little esteem them / or why should
you not use them as brethren / let it not be truly said of you / that the
blasphemous swearer / and the filthy adulterer may find more favor among you
then our christian brethren / and fellow workmen in the Lord / I know for the
first of these there is no law to touch him / and for the second very
slender punishment provided / yet for both the Lord has left unto us very
sharp laws / these are unexecuted / and ye wicked escape many times for money.
Many good laws (thanks be to God) are provided to bridle the wicked / but in
them oftentimes the godly are snared / and by them you your selves (if not
now) yet at other times have been instruments to burden your brethrens backs
/ and that has some of them felt in more sharp sort (as I have heard) then I
will hear speak. Well / let that pass / and now deal more christianly for ye
Lords sake with your brethren / let not laws that were purposely made for the
wicked / be made snares by you to catch the godly / lay aside this Lording /
and show your selves brethren in deed / if they have offended you / admonish
them brotherly / let not ye usurped names and titles of Lord and Lords grace
so puff you up / as you forget your selves to be pastors, preachers: ye lord
called you or ye most of you to this office to join as laborers together with
your brethren in his vineyarde / he never called you to these lordly names and
dignities: the office of bishop I find appointed by scripture: the office of
Lordbishop I find no warrant for there / but in this I mean not to wade
further / only I beseech you / yt as Christ has allotted you to be fellow
ministers together with them / so you will as companions in the Lord join
together to further one truth and sincerity / and let these pore men taste of
your christian charity toward them / as brethren / and cease lordly to neglect
them / and Lord it no longer / think it no discredit to you / or an abasing of
your selves / to ioyn in equaliti with your brethren / but think it great
presu^ption in you to clime higher then the lord has appointed: remember it
was not in vain said of Christ our savior / Principes gentiu^ dominantur in
eas, etc: inter vos autem non erat sic, I seek not to teach / neither take I
upon me so to do / yet despise not the admonition of your faithful brother in
the Lord / who wishes to you all such godly consideration of your duties / as
in no respect you omit any part thereof.

To conclude / in the name of god I beseech you yield no such fruits of ye
gospel / as where you should be careful / you show your selves careless of your
brethren / nether post ye matter over in such sort as you have done / from one
to an other / but so long as they keep them within the limits of the law of
god: join christianly and brotherly with them and assist them / and cease so to
affect lordship and living as thereby you be wtdrawne from yelding to a known
and manifest truth. The Lord in his rich mercy give every of us grace so to
avoid all snares of satan / as wholly without let or hinderance we may be
dedicated unto him / and yield our selves all together obedient unto his will /
so yt what he has commanded we may strive to maintain / and what he has
forbidden / we may endeavor to suppress. Thus praying your favorable
acceptatio^ hereof I commit you to ye lord Jesus.

An Exhortation to THE BISHOPS AND THEIR Clergy to answer a little book
that came forth the last Parliament / and to other Brethren to judge of it by
Gods word / until they see it aunsweared / and not to be carried away with any
respect of man.
COnsidering the unity of the body of Christ which are we (because it is
governed with one head and one spirit / and yet notwythstanding a diversity
of parts and members / for the body is not one member / for if they were all
one member / where were the body)? 1. Cor. 12.13.14.19.
I have to direct my talk to a whole body / yet so yt either part hearken
to that only which is belonging unto him / not snatching yt unto him / which
is not proper to him / and unto every member severally / but in such sort /
that they be not divided or cut a part from the whole. There are in the
Church of Christ eyes and ears / there are also hands and feet / to either
of these I have a request to make / for their profit / if they hear it / to
their smart / if they reiecte it. 15.26.
I speak unto them in the Lords name / and do herein but his message. I
require understanding ears therefore / and watchful eyes / I demand diligent
hands / and painful feet. It is not unknown (brethren) how it has pleased
the Lord of late to bring forth to the eyes and hands of you all a little
scroll / containing as you know / matters concerning the true reforming and
building of gods church / whether it tend in deed to that end or not / I have
not here to debate / but that it pretends / at this I have seen some
stormyng / as in ye grief of man is easily to be perceived: and the authors of
it / as we know also / are in the place of thieves and murderers: for them I
have naught else to say / but that they are there justly / if falsely and
untruly they have gone about to spoil and rob us of an unfeigned truth / and
murder our souls with a corrupt and poisoned water / drawn out of a stinking
puddel of the filthy dunghill of man's brains. For how were that to be
suffered in the civil laws of earthly princes / that some one of the commen
sort / or else other / should go about to disanul the order and law set out by
the Prince / Gods lieuetenau^t in earth in those cases / to place his own
devise? much more in the house of God / which is his church. To me it seems
a thing so intolerable / yt all the New gates and old gates yea and all
tibournes in England are too little for such rash and presumtious heads / that
will not give God leave to rule / but will take the scepter out of his hand.
Being more over and besides that / a shameful and horrible thing to make
strife and contention between the people of God / which are commanded to be
one as their head / and his father are one. Ioh. 17.22
It was ye last and newest commandment that Christ left unto us / that we
should love one a another / even as he loved us / and this he told us / should
be a sign whereby we should be known to be his disciples / if we love one an
other as he loved us / which is not fleshlye or carnally / or for any worldly
respect / but in the consent and agreement of his commandment / in following
the prescrypt of his word / wherein consists the cause of all our love / and
cause of al hatred / even of our parents / when they swerve from it: Ioh. 15.11
13.35.
John. 14.23.15.10.14. mat. 10.35
which surely cannot be maintained / where new and strange orders in Gods
matters are invented / broched / and publyshed / be who so be may / the causers
or founders of such devises. And therefore better it were for them / that a
mylstone were hanged about their necks / and they drouned in the myddest of
the sea / then one of the least of ye kingdom of Christ / should be offended
by their devises. mat. 18.0.
But as I said / I mind not to entreat of that matter / my desire is / and
that for Isreal's sake / I mean the children and church of God / yt they which
are the eyes of the church / and are our overseers to watch for our souls
(for our blood must be required at their hands) would take this matter in hand
/ to debate the equity and truth of the cause / by the scriptures and word of
God / which is the only food of our souls / and stay for the direction of
all our godly actions / that we the sheep of Christ might know false fodder
from true / corn from chafe / Schism from Truth / Christ from Antichriste.
Eze. 3.17.
Ioh. 6.27 Heb. 5.12. Psalm. 119.105.
The accusation is grievous wherewith our clergy is burdened / they are
indired as ye folowers of Antichrist / their mynisterie is vouched to be from
the Pope / their superiority which they have by order of this realm / as
Lords spiritual / and a necessary part of ye high house of Parliament in
establishyng politic laws for the profit of the common weal / beside the
jurisdiction episcopal / which they have over their diocesses / is there
condemned as a thing in no wise tolerable by the word of God / which thing
amaseth and daseleth the eyes of us the simpler and unlearned sort / that we
know not how to esteem of them / or of our selves / if the truth be so / we
ought not to hear them / although they speak a truth / more then the devil
was to be suffered / although he professed Christ. Luke 4.41
If it be not so / we marvel why so short and piuyshe a thing is not by them
answered / that many simple-men / which will well to gods cause / and are
somewhat shaken with this pamflet / might have better stay / that they be not
carried away with it. Therefore my humble suit is to the learnedder part in ye
name of Christ / and the behalf of his congregation / that they would answer
it and healpe us which are unlearned. And here in I shall in Gods name / and
as they will answer at the last day / exhort them to use simple and sincere
dealing / and not to wring the scripture to serve their own turn / or other
men's fantasies. For if they do / it will easily be spied: and beside other
inconuenices that will ensue thereof / the people whom they shall deceive
thereby / shall be their condemnation at that day. Cogge not therefore / nor
forste / neither bumbaste it with Rhetoric / or man's authoritiy to make a
show / but let the word of the eternal be judge between both / which is
goulde and silver / and which is dross and stubble: which is corn / and which
is chafe. Call I beseech you / to remembrance this saying of an a^cient
father. quam sapiens argumentatrix sibi videtur humana ignorantia, Tertullian
lib. de spectaculis.
praesertim cum aliquid de gaudijs et fructibus seculi metuit amittere? How
wise a dysputer (says Tertullian) does man's ignorance seem to it self /
chiefly when it fears to lose any pleasure or worldly profyt. But answer I
pray you the whole book / and not by pieces / for otherwise your doings will
be suspected / neither do it in hudder mudder / or secretly / or in a tongue
that the people know not / for then it will be said that you dare not
publyshe it / but do it openly / that all the people may see that you stand
upon a good ground / upon which if you do stand / let not your doyngs fear
the light. Job. 10.12
We crave nothing of them / but what they are bound unto of duerye / they are
our wachmen: we take / yea rather they themselves take these for wolves / why
then do they not chase them away? They are fast enough ye will say. It is true
/ but their tales are not? they free as fire brands from place to place / and
set all the country on fire. It is requisyte also that they be prysoned; but
that will not otherwise be / they with the like reason must captiuate reason / a
word will not be bound but with a word / the keys of the kingdom of heaven
must come forth here / or else the keys of Newgate will do no good. And if
they do not come torche / ignorant men and simple / will say that the other
are to little purpose brought forth. There is a better way for Bissops / and
Bishops of Christ / to confute a schism by / tha^ prisons and chains: those
were and are Antichrists bishops arguments being taken a part: as they are
the just weapons of a lawful and godly Maiestrate / if the other go before.
Some say they remember well that godly saying of that learned man / Augustine / I
think it be: Si terrerentur et non docerentur improba quasi dominatio
videretur. If they should be feared and not taught / it might seem a wicked
governance / the^ sent not practiced of the clergy / they are glad to see
their Prince to come with terrerentur, they would as fame see the Bishops come
with docerentur. So you see what of duty they require / and surely let me say
with your Honors patience what I think / is it not a great discredyte to your
Lordships that such a scalde trifeling book can not be answered in this season?
It is very short / you bear us in hand it is folyshe / join the follye of
it with the breuitye / it might easily have been answered ere this; If there
had been taken almost but for every leaf a month: there are skarce so many
leaves in it / as there are months past since it came forth / what remains
then / but that I renew my suit / that herein (with the consyderation of Christ
and his flock) you would have regard to your own honors and creadyte /
that it be not further spread / and said you could not answer it? They do not
satisfye them selves with pollytyque reasons / in that that some say even from
your L. that it is a subuersyon of a state / it is a great troublyng of a
governance. They say the question is not / whether it be troublesome to bring
that in which they would / but whether it be a truth that those men say or
no? If that be once resolved / then have they to stay them selves: They are
ready enough to object the difficulty of Elyas time / how hard a thing it was
in the ears of the king and people to speak to the^ of ye worship of one god
/ which were now dotyng worshyppers of their Balims: 1. re. 18.17.
what an impossible thing it was to bring in the true priesthode of Moses
amongst a sort of Idolaters which had cast Moses out of the temple. mat.
21.33. Ioh. 19.12 Acts. 4.7.
They have the example of Christ and his Apostles at the fyngers end / and
that the priests then said / by what authority do thou this. And again to
Pilate / if thou let him go thou art not Caesar his friend. In his good and
just purpose they could accuse him of treason / of a conspiracye / and for
their own parts ask him by what authority / and so is it now say they with
our Bishops / they go not to the scryptures as Christ wylleth in the person
of the scrybes / but they cry out against these pore men they are not ye
Queen's friends / they make a trouble in a state / these and such like are
their words / your honors have to consider upon the matter accordyngly. And
thus much to your honors wyshyng your sauetye / if it so please God without
any shaking / and that your thrones may stand for ever / if they be from God /
which these men seem to call in doubt / and I trust your Lordships will show in
vain / and how vaynely they stand. Now to you my brethren / which are of the
inferioure sort / I have to desire you to cleave to the truth / and be not
moved for what so ever. If this be truth which our honorable clergy do now
maintain / cast away that peeuyshe and fond book / let not a leaf of paper
scrabled / and blyndly by stealthe Prynted / more prevail with you / then an
order so long mayntayned by ancient canons and civil law / let not one or
two private men of no account or countenance / more persuade with you then
multytudes of good place / and doers in the behalf of your virtuous Prince and
Country. Let not the judgment of young men prevail against the graye
heads of old fathers: for so may you quickly fall from a truth / and go
astray when you thyncke you go strayghte. 1. reg. 12.8
Set before you the example of Rehoboam / who if he had followed the advise of
his old counselors / and not the rash and green heads of young men / his
kingdom had not been so soon rent from him. 1. reg. 1.21. Act. 4.19.5.30.
But if on the contrary side / the truth go on their side / if by good and
dilygent conference of the scryptures / you may see that they are in the right
way / the^ what other counsel should I give you / but if Baall be God / follow
him: if the Lord be God / follow him / better it is to obey God than man.
Better it is to go strayghte with Elias and Christ / then to go a whoryng
with all the Baalites / Scribes / and Pharisees: a multitude may as easly err
as one / it was so then / it is so now / four hundredth and fifty Prophets of
Baal for one Elias / four hundred false Prophets against one Micheas: 1. re.
18.22. 1. reg. 22.6
the most part of the world now Mahometistes and Papists: and surely it was
truly said of him / who so ever he were Nihil omnino agimus qui nos per
multitudinis exempla defendimus. We do nothing at al / which defend our selves
by example of the multitude: Not always the best learned were the wisest in
Gods matters: example of Nicodemus / who understood not what it was to be born
again: John. 3.4. Ioh. 9.30. mar. 7.2.3.
Not always the wysest favor wisdom most / but rather resyst it / and
strive more for the washyng of hands and pottes then they do for the kingdom
of God. Masters of religyon are not always the most zealous in setting forth a
truth / sometimes they can say to the pore lame man / Sabbathum est, Ioh. 5.10.
it is the sabbath day / non licet tibi tollere grabbatum: it is not lawful for
thee to take up thy bed: and if the blind will stand and dispute with the^ /
and say that Christ is not homo peccator a sinful man / although to their
thinkyng / Sabbathum non seruat, Ioh. 9.34.
he keeps not the Sabbothe / he shall be excommunicate. The unlearned
sometime are so allowed of God for their good and godly endeavors / that he
makes them scholemaysters of the learned and great doctor. Look upon pore
Philip how he instructed Nathanaell Inuenim sillum, Ioh. 1.46.
we have found him of whom Moses wrote / and the Prophets even Jesus the
son of Iosephe / that man of Nazareth. And let not the vileness of
Nazareth any thing amase us / such false preiudicies may shut up the
kingdom of heaven against us / we can not say that no good can come out of
pore me^nes studyes / if we do so / we should speak folyshly as they did in
those days / can there any goodness come from Nazareth. God is not in deed
bound to Nazareth: Mark. 1. Luke 2.8. Math. 22. Mat. 28 Ioh. 20.18
no more is he debarred from doing good by Nazareth: he is not bound to any
poor simple man: no more is he cut of from showing ye vision of Angels unto
shepherds / and himself to women / but slender messengers to the syghte of the
world / to inform the world and witty of the birth and resurrection of
Christ. It says oftentimes also / that the wise and mighty men of ye world
will say to Christ / of and against the crying out of his pore disciples) chyde
the^: Lu. 19.39.
But if they do you know what Christ said at ye time / and he says so now to:
I tell you / if these hold their peaces / the stones shall straight way cry
out: his disciples may hold their peace / I say the Bishops may hold their
peace / and I say because Christ said / stones / these stones may speak:
There may be a foul gloss made upon a good matter / an evil favored cloak
put upon a fair body: The truth may be accused of sedition / of trouble / of
breaking of states / Act. 14.5.
if it be so / it is no new thing / if ye be once assured of an undoubted
truth / if it be not foul within / and fair without / if it be gold and
silver / and not stubble grounded upon the true foundation Jesus Christ care
you not / for that Christ called his truth a sword / a fire / and he himself
long ago was spyted at for ye / and accused to. Luke 20 20. John. 11 20. Mat.
10 25.
Non est seruus supra magistrum, there is no servant above his master / if
they called the master of the house Beelzebub / how much more them of his
household? the more ye men are cried out upon for calling for the practice of
Gods word / if it should destroy al policies in the world / (although they yt
say so / say nothing / for the contrary is true / the practisyng of Gods word /
and walking in his religion uprightly / is the establishing and strengthenyng
of kyngdoms) the more I say they are cried out upon / the more they ought to
go forwards / as well as the blind man did / when whole multytudes bad him
hold his peace: they may not cease I say / although whole multytudes cry out
against them / and say hold your peace / hold your peace / if they will be
restored to their sight / and be delivered from blindness to cry / and to cry
out a loud: Luke 15.39.
Thou son of David have mercy on me: These pore men may cry out / yea ought
to cry out / if they see us in blindness / O son of David have mercy on them
/ and so they deserve our favor and friendship / rather then prysons and
Newgate: if we be blind / I say if we be / for yt will be discussed I trust by
the learned. And if they hold their peace / we have to think we are in
blyndnesse / and that they cry well / son of David have mercy upon us. In
deed if their book be true (and that I may speak as one of you / simple and
unlearned / I shall think it to be true / until I see it confuted by the
scriptures) the^ will I also as well as you / as well as they / cry out in
despyte of all ye multitude / because I have a greater desire to be restored to
sight / the^ fear to dysplease the^ / O son of David have mercy upon us:
And if all Jerusalem should be displeased because I say / blessed is he that
comes in the name of the lord / yet would I alone cry out / blessed is he ye
comes in the name of the Lord / were it as new and as strange as it was then
/ seem it never so great a monster to call the Samaritanes from worshipping in
the mountain Garazim / or the Jews from the settled place Jerusalem / from an
old and ancient custom / which has possessyon many hundredth years / yet had
I rather be with Christ / than with the woman of Samarie / until she come to
Christ. John. 4.20.
Antiquity may deceive us, nay we see it has deceived us / I can not tell
whether it would still deceive: it is not true to say / it is old / therefore it
is good: Ioh. 14.30.
Satan has been Lord of this world a great while: Antichrist of Rome pleads
ye continuance of many years (I know not) how many C. years / neither does it
follow it is new / therefore it was naught: Mar. 1.27.
it was said to Christ / what new doctrine is this: yet it was no false
doctrine: so said the false priests and Bishops of Paul's doctrine and the
rest / but it was not therefore naught: Act. 24.14.
will you try ye old and the new / and see in deed which is the new / which
is the old / search ye scriptures. If it be found there / it is old / say
Bishops what they will / let the Priests call it as new as they list: if it be
not found there / it is new / let them say what they can / and bring never so
many fathers / and never so good fathers: better the^ she brought / I am sure
they can not / and yet did Christ prevail / and so will he still: for he is
the same in his word / that he was then in bodily presence / the writing of
the Apostles do paint him out truly / and nothing but him. If it be true yt
they say / that this authority of Bishops / and church hierarchy which they
maintain / come from the Pope / and has no ground but in his law / and that
God can not suffer to be served according to men's pleasures in ruling of his
house / as though he were such a fool yt he could not set order himself or were
careless (which is no point of wit) yt he did not: or yt he see so little / as
to devise an order which could not be for all times and places / so that we
should have need of a new holy ghost / (for all this follows upon that ground
yt they stand upon) away with that vile doctrine / or what so ever ye list to
term it / what inconvenience so ever were like to ensue / what antiquity so
ever be against it / for you see there is a blasphemy joined with it / which
makes our God a folish / a careless / an uncircumspect / and improvident god.
Well / peradventure they see something more then they say / and some things I am
sure they would have to be reformed / which they can not bring to pass as they
would / and therefore think it better with policy to save the gospel / then
to have it clean shut out: It is a common saying of two evils it is best to
choose the least: Ih. 10.1
better it is to have a gospel of Christ joined with a piece of Antichriste /
then to have none at all: thus they persuade them selves / the other do not so
/ they think it not lawful to join God and Belial together: surely they have
some reason / nay they have great reason / for what society has light with
darkness. 2. Cor. 6 14.
If all the world might be gained with a little breach of Gods word / it were
not to be done / better it were that the whole world should pearishe / then one
jot of Gods truth should be over slipped: Ih. 19.1.
Pilate thought he had behaved himself wisely when he whipped Christ / and
put upon him a robe of scarlet / thinking by that means / making him to
appear vile to ye Jews / to have had him let go / that they might have
contented themselves with that little punishment / and so might Christ have
preached still. But it is wickedly done to policy the matters of Christ after
that sort. Who so ever thinks by putting a foles cote upon Christ and
clothing him with a garment which is not his own / to entertain him still /
and thinks he is content by such means to have license to go preaching
amongst the people / he deceives himself / and shall right well understand at
the day of accomptes / that God will not be mocked. Thus in some respect you
have well to weigh the things that are put forth unto you / by the scriptures /
without further circumstances / least in leaving the rule / ye go out of rule.
But I doubt not but our lords and clergy will quickly show you whether it be well
ruled or no / they have said already in their sermons to you / yt it is a very
folish book / I trust they will give it unto you in writing / yt you may ye
better way both. But before al things take heed to ye word let not ye show of
man deceive you: Peradventure some of you will be persuaded / because a bishop
an old man / a very learned man says so / because this state has continued a
great while many years amongst good fathers: John. 5.39. Act. 1.21
do not so / yt is no warrant of ye word / you have had examples enough to show
unto you / how easy it is to be deceived therein / on ye other side let not ye
simplicity of men bear you away / for yt way also you may err: the only
straight way (as I have told you) to keep you from going astray / is ye word
of god / wherwt they as well as you / I trust / will be co^te^t to be tried /
otherwise they have no ground against the papists: if they will not / but
refuse to be judged by ye word / leave the^ there / those pore prisoners have ye
right / whether they be whipped and scurged / or utterly hanged / and assure
your selves as well of them as of your selves / if they suffer with Christ / they
shall be glorified with Christ / and so shall you. Romans 8.17.
That we may so do / god give us ye knowledge of the truth / and when we know
it to stand steadfast in ye truth / yt the love of the world / and fear of man
may not more prevail with us then the love of heaven and fear of god. These
things yt I have said unto you rudely / I pray you take in good part (good
brethren) both you yt are of ye learned sort / and you yt are of ye sympler / I
pray you lay forth the truth / as your duty binds you / and you give ear
to the truth. Confute scismes by ye scriptures / and judge you the^ by
scriptures also / as prisons be used / so let the word which is the armor of
your warfare be practiced: Let not newegate be the only means to stay false
procedings: If you do so / where error is redressed by ye magistrate / you
shall be judged because you did not your duty / and bring the^ into ye way if
they be out / or by such good co^fere^ce they bring you home. The which ye
father of al mercies grant through his son Christ by our co^fortor the holy
ghost.

FINIS.
