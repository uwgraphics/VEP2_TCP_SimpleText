DE Laudibus Legum Angliae written by Sir JOHN FORTESCVE L. Chapter Justice, and
after L. Chancellor to K. Henry VI. Hereto are ioind the two Sums of Sir
RALPH de HENGHAM L. Chapter Justice to K. Edward I. commonly called Hengham Magna,
and Hengham Parua. Never before published. Notes both on FORTESCVE and HENGHAM
are added.

To the Reader.
THis Author, Sir John Fortescue, was Chief Justice to Hen: VI, as the Records
of the later half of his Reign, every where show; and that he might Statum
suum decentius manutenere, in Part. 1. Rot. Pat. 20. Hen. 6. membran. 10. an
annuity of CLxxx marks is given him out of the Hamper, with Cxvj.s.xj.d. q.
Percipiendum singulis annis ad Festum natalis Domini pro vna roba and furrura
pro eadem, erga idem festum, and Lxvj.s.vj.d. singulis annis ad festum
Pentecostes pro vna roba and linura pro eadem, erga idem festum. He is called
his Chancellor also. In this book, his title, given by himself, is
Cancellarius Angliae, and in his Declaration, or rather Retractation, of that
he had written against the title of the house of York, himself puts in the mouth
of a friend of his expostulating with him, these words, Considering that ye
were the Chief Chancellor to the said late King. It seems, being with Henry
VI. driven into Scotland, he was made his Chancellor, the memory whereof (as
it could hardly be otherwise) wants in the Patent Rolls. His books which I
have seen are three. This now newly published, his Difference between Dominium
Regale and Dominium Politicum and regale, and that Declaration touching the
title of the Crown. Neither of the two last were ever published, but they
remain Mss. in diverse hands. As touching his descent; by good testimony, he
is made son to Henry Fortescue son of Sir John Fortescue knight (Captain
of Meaux and Governor of Brie in France under Hen: V.) who was second son of
William Fortescue of Wimeston in Devonshire Esquire. Because he was Englisht
by him that first published him, this, part of the title, and the Notes on him
are in English. what he has of the Commendations of the Law of England, must
not be expected to be so copious, as if all, that might thereof have been
said, had been hunted for by him to be here congested. He shows that he
instructed the young Prince, and only in some such few occurences of our
trialls and positions, as might be, without difficulty, apprehended by a
mind so tender and strange to the Courts of judicial contention. Neither
gives he enough to satisfy or the malice, or the ignorance of some foul
mouthed declaimers against it, who for the most part (if they descend to
particulars and make a case to find fault withal) either ridiculously compact
things incompatible, just like the Sycophant in that Geographie of his in
Trinummus, Omnium primum in Pontum aduecti ad Arabiam terramsumus and thence Ad
Caput amnis quod de coelo exoritur sub solio Iouis, or else, measuring an
established and universal proceeding or position only by their own damage,
never coming near apprehension of the true reason, rail at it, with like
judgment, as the Parasit, in a lost Comedy of Plautus, does at the certain
course of sun Dialls, being thence only moved, because the shadow went not so
fast as his stomach, which when he was a Child was the only Dial, and that --
iste monebat esse, nisi quum nihil erat.
Nunc etiam quod est non est, nisi SOLI lubet
But no place is here for more of this, and nos hac a scabie tenemus vngues. To
this edition, are added the Su^mes of Sir Ralph de Hengham Chief Justice to
Edward I. never till now printed; in whom although most of the learning be
touching Essoines, Defalts, and course of proceedings in such actions which are
in seldom use at this day, yet diverse things occur both specially obseruable
in what he has touching those proceedings (which a professor of the Law
cannot but wish to know) as also he often otherwise gives light to the
Customs or Law of his time, whence, as through an ancestor of the right line,
we must deduct that of the present. Of him in the preface to the Reader,
before him, enough is said, and of his Sums. Of his language, which with the
rest of our Common Law Latin is accused of Barbarism, somewhat is there brought
in excuse. That preface was thought fit to speak Latin, the author of the book
himself being published only in that tongue. But the Notes are English. For what
other readers then English are to be expected? Many an ignorant had been
deterred by pure Latin, and to have used Barbarism in them would have turned
the stomach of a polite Reader. Though diverse Copies of Hengham were examined
in preparing this, yet could not a perfect one be extracted from them all. As
one helped another, choice was so made that this might be the best; which yet
is not without many faulty passages. So faithfully it is published from the Mss.
that even the false language, which by consent of old Copies appeard not to be
the transcribers, but proceeded from the ages either negligence or ignorance,
is religiously retained* so should the lost monuments of ancient writers be
given to the public; so should we abstain from wronging their Manes. Some
places, that the erring hands of such as anciently Copied him corrupted, are by
way (among other observations collected in the heat of the press) noted, and
either by conjecture restored, explaned, or, marked with asteriskes, left to
better Judgment. The varying of letter, in the print, is only to lead the
Readers eye the sooner to what he may look after. Farewell from the Inner
Temple, September XXIV.M.DC.XVI.

Vale.
To the right Worshipful John Walshe, Esquire, one of the Queen her learned
Iusticers of her Highness Court of common Plees, Robert Mulcaster, wishes
life and health.
IT happened me of late (Right Worshipful sir) to light upon this little
Treatise, which I incontinent desired to run over, because it seemed to
discourse upon some points of the Laws of our Country, whereof I my self then
was and am now a Student. When I had overrun it, my desire to read it,
became nothing counteruailable with the gladness that I had read it, for my
desire to read it came upon hope, to find some profitable lessons for my
study, but my gladness after reading sprang of the excellency of the
argument, whereon I did not dream, neither to find so rich a treasure in so
simple an habit. And because I wished al men to have part of my delight, me
thought it good to translate it into English forth of Latin, in which tongue it
was first written. The author of the book was one master Fortescue Knight,
Serieant at the Law, and for his skill and virtues preferred by king Henry the
sixth, to be Chancellor of this Realm. The entry of the book it self shows,
where, and upon what occasion, it was written. It was written in Berrie in
France, where Prince Edward, son to Henry the sixth, afterward slain at
Tewkesburie by Edward the fourth, did then remain with his mother Queen
Margaret in the house of Renate her father Duke of Angew and king of Cicile,
during the time that Edward the fourth reigned in the Realm, and Henry the
sixth was fled into Scotland. The occasion was this: The Chancellor being fled
into France with the young prince, and perceiving his delight to be all bent to
Chivalry as a thing of greatest need, considering he meant by force the
restitution of his father, and thereby his own, to the kingdom of England,
took occasion (for that his hope was to see the Prince reign here) to move
him to a division of his affairs, and as he armed himself against the enemy, so
to adorn himself against his being king, with skill of Laws, which do
preserve each state so in peace, that it may, if need be, war; and so guard it
in war, that it may have peace in it. The argument is this, that the skill of
the Country laws is needful for the Prince, although not so deep as for
purposed professors, yet so full as to their honor may and ought to fall in
Princes. And for that the Prince should think the thing to be a princely
knowledge, he takes occasion (by comparing the government of this realm with
others, and the laws of this land with the Civil, with whom it is of all men
lightly compared, and the betternesse of points wherein they both travel, and
provisions by the one wiselier foreseen then by the other) to prove the
singularity of this state which it behooued the Prince to learn, seeing he
was like to succeed his father, and to understand the Laws, which makes the
state to be singular. The particulars I refer to the book, whereof thus much
I do and no less could well say, Why I did choose your worship to be protector
of my labors, I shall not need tediously to touch, it shall be sufficient to
say that in choice of many, I picked you alone, not doubting your liking in
allowing, seeing mine election in dedicating: And so committing to the
Almighty the good preservation of your worship, I humbly take my leave,

Robert Mulcaster.

The introduction into the matter.
DUring the cruel rage of the late mortal wars within the realm of England,
when the most virtuous and godly King Henry the sixth with Queen Margaret his
wife, the Kings daughter of Jerusalem and Scicile, and their only son Edward
Prince of Wales, were forced to fly the land: and the king himself afterward
in the same civil tumult falling into the blody hands of his deadly enemies his
own subjects, was of them committed to prison, where he a long time remained in
strait captivity, the Queen and the prince her son thus banished out of their
country, making their abode in the Duchy of Berrie, a dominion of the foresaid
king of Jerusalem.

The Prince shortly after growing to ma^s state, applied himself wholly to the
feats of arms, much delighting to ride upon wild and vnbroke^ horses, not
sparing with spurs to break their fiercenes. He practiced also sometimes with
the pike, sometimes with the sword, and other warlik weapons after the manner
and guise of warriors according to the use of martial discipline, to assail
and strike his companions, I mean the young men that attended upon his
person. Which thing when a certain ancient knight, being Chancellor to the
foresaid king of England saw, who also in the miserable time did there remain
in exile he spoke thus to the Prince.

SEuiente dudum in regno Angliae nefandissima rabie illa, qua pijssimus ibidem
Rex Henricus sextus, cum Margareta Regina consorte sua, filia Regis Jerusalem
and Sciciliae, ac eorum vnigenito Edwardo principe Walliae, inde propulsi sunt
sub qua and demum Rex ipse Henric' a subditis suis deprehensus, carceris
diutinum passus est horrorem, dum Regina ipsa cum sobole, patria sic extorris,
in Ducatu Berren^ praedicti regis Jerusalem dominio, morabantur.

Princeps ille, mox vt factus est adultus, militari totu^ se co^tulit
disciplinae, and saepe ferocibus and quasi indomitis insedens caballis, eos
calcaribus vrgens, quandoquelancea, qua^doque mucrone, alijs quoque
instrumentis bellicis, sodales suos, iuuenes sibi seruientes, bellantium more
inuadere ferireque, iuxta martis gimnasij rudimenta delectabatur. Quod cernens
miles quidam grandae^us, praedicti regis Angliae Cancellarius, qui etiam ibide^
sub hac clade exulabat: pri^cipem sic affatur,

First he moves the prince to the knowledge of the law. Chap. 1.
YOur singular towardness, most gracious Prince, makes me right glad, when I
behold how earnestly you do embrace martial feats: For it is convenient for
your grace to be thus delited, not only for that you are a soldier, but much
rather for that you shall be a King. For it is the office and duty of a King
to fight the battles of his people, and also rightly to judge them, as in the
viii. chapter of the first book of kings you are plainly taught. Wherefore I
would wish your grace to be with as ernest zeal given to the study of the
laws, as you are to the knowledge of arms, because that like as wars by
force of chivalry are ended, even so judgments by the Laws are determined.
Which thing Justinian the Emperor well and wisely and advisedly pondering, in
the beginning of the preface of his book says thus: It behooves the imperial
majesty not only to be guarded with arms, but also to be armed with laws, to
the end that he may be able rightly to execute the government of both times
as well of war as of peace. Howbeit for your most earnest endeavor to the study
of the Law, the exhortation of the chiefest lawmaker Moses, sometime captain
of the Synagogue, ought to be of much more force with you, then the words of
Justinian whereas in the xvii. Chapter of the book of Deuteronomie he does by
the authority of God straightly charge the Kings of Israel to be readers of the
law all the days of their life saying thus: When the King shall sit upon the
princely seat of his kingdom, he shall write him out this law in a book,
taking the copy thereof of the priests the Levites: and he shall have it with
him, and he shall read it all the days of his life, that he may learn to
fear the Lord his God, and to keep his Commandments and ordinances written
in this Law, And Helynandus expounding the same says thus: A Prince therefore
must not be ignorant of the law, neither is it tolerable that he under the
pretense of warfare should be unskillful in the Law. And a little after he is
commanded, says he, to receive the copy of the law of the priests the
Levites, that is to say, of catholic and learned men, Thus much he: For the
book of Deuteronomie is the book of the laws, wherewith the kings of Israel
were bound to rule and govern their subjects. This book does Moses command
kings to read, that they may learn to fear GOD, and keep his Commandments,
which are written in the Law.

Behold the effect of the law is to fear God, whereunto man cannot attain,
unless he first know the will of God, which is written in the Law. For the
principal point of all service is to know the will and pleasure of the* lord
or master to whom service is due. Howbeit the lawmaker Moses first in this
charge mentions the effect of the Law, that is the fear of God, and next he
allureth us to the keeping of the cause thereof, that is to say, of Gods
commandments. For in the mind and intent of the exhorter, the effect goes
before the cause. But what fear is this, which the Laws do propone to the
obseruers thereof? Surely it is not that fear whereof it is written: that
perfect charity or love expels fear. Yet this same fear, though it be
bond and servile, oftentimes provoke kings to the reading of the laws: but
it proceeds not out of the law. But that fear wheerof Moses here speaks,
which also proceeds out of the Laws, is the self same fear, that the
prophet speaks of, saying: The fear of the Lord is holy, and endures for
ever and ever. This is such a loving fear as naturally children bear to their
dear parents, commonly termed the reverence of the child toward his parents.
Whereunto there is no punishment due as a thing wrought by love. For this fear
proceeds out of the Laws, which teach to do the will of God, so that it
deserves no punishment. But the glory of the Lord is upon them that fear
him, and he does glorify them. Yea this fear, is even that same, fear
whereof Job, after that he had diversely searched for wisdom, says thus:
Behold the fear of the Lord is perfect wisdom, and to forsake evil is
understanding. That the forsaking of evil is the understanding of the fear of
God, this do the Laws teach, whereby it follows that the same fear
proceeds out of them.

GAudeo vero, serenissime pri^ceps, super nobilissima indole tua: videns quanta
auiditate militares tu amplecteris actus, conuenit namque tibi taliter
delectari, nedum quia miles es, sed amplius quia Rex futurus es. Regis nempe
officium pugnare est bella populi sui, and eos rectissime iudicare, vt primo
regum capitul.cviij. clarissime tu doceris. Quare vt armorum, vtinam and legu^
studiis, simili zelo te deditum conte^plarer, cum vt armis bella, ita legibus
iudicia peragantur. Quod Iustinianus Augustus, aequissima librans mente, in
initio prohem^j libri sui institutionum, ait: Imperatoriam Maiestatem non solum
armis decoratam, sed and legibus oportet esse armatam, vt vtrumque tempus
bellorum and pacis recte possit gubernare. Tamen vt ad legum studia feruide tu
anheles, maximus legislator ille Moses, olim Synagogae dux, multo fortius
Caesare te inuitat, dum regibus Israel diuina auctoritate ipse praecipiat,
eorum leges legere omnibus diebus vitae suae, sic dicens: Postquam sederit Rex
in solio regni sui describet sibi Deuteronomij Leges in volumine, accipiens
exemplar a sacerdotibus Leuiticae tribus and habebit secum, leget* que illud
omnibus diebus vitae suae, vt discat timere Dominum Deum suum, and custodire
verba and ceremonias eius quae in lege scripta sunt, Deuteron. capit. decimo
septimo, quoth exponens Helynandus dicit: Princeps ergo non debet iuris ignarus
esse, nec praetextu militiae legem permittitur ignorare. Et post pauca, a
sacerdotibus Leuiticae tribus assumere iubetur exemplar legis, id est a viris
Catholicis and literatis, Haec ille: Liber quippe Deuteron. est liber legum,
quibus Reges Israel subditum sibi populum regere teneba^tur. Hunc librum.
legere, iubet Moses Reges, vt discant timere Deum, and custodire mandata eius,
quae lege scripta sunt.

Ecce timere Deum effectus est legis, quem non consequi valet homo, nisi prius
sciat voluntatem Dei, quae in lege scripta est. Nam principium omnis famulatus,
est scire voluntatem domini cui seruitur. Legis tamen lator Moses, primo in
hoc edicto effectu^ legis videlicet timorem Dei commemorat: deinde ad custodiam
causae eius, videlicet, mandatorum dei ipse inuitar. Nam effectus prior est
qua^ causa, in any mo exhorta^tis. Sed quis est timor iste, que^ promittu^t
leges obseruatoribus suis? Vere non est timor ille, de quo scribitur: Quod
perfecta charitas for as mittit timorem. Timor tamen ille, licet seru^lis, saepe
ad legendum leges, reges concitat. sed non est ipse proles legis. Timor vero,
de quo hic loquitur Moses, quem and pariunt leges, est ille de quo dicit
propheta: Timor Domini sanctus* permanet in seculum seculi. Hic filialis est
and non nouit paenam, vt ille qui per charitatem expellitur. Nam iste a legibus
proficiscitur, quae docent facere voluntatem Dei, quo ipse paena^ non meretur.
Sed gloria do mini est super metuentes eu^, quos and ipse glorificat. Timor
autem iste, timor ille est, de quo Job, postquam mul tifarie sapientia^
inuestigat, sic ait: Ecce timor domini, ipsa est sapie^tia, and recedere a malo
intelligentia. Job ca. 28. Recedere a malo, quoth intelligentia timoris dei est,
leges docent, quo and timore^ hanc ipsae parturiunt.

The Princes reply to the Chancellours motion. Chap. 2.
HAEc vt audiuit princeps, erecto in senem vultu, sic locutus est. Scio,
Cancellarie, quod liber deuteronomy. quem ^u commemoras, sacrae scripturae volumen
est; leges quoque and ceremoniae in eo conscriptae, etiam sacrae sunt, a domino
edi^ae, and per Moysen promulgatae: quare eas legere sanctae conte^plationis
dulcedo est. Sed lex, ad cuius scientiam me inuitas, humana est, ab hominibus
aedita, and tracta^s terrena: quo, licet Moses ad Deuter lecturam Reges Israel
astrinxerit, eum per hoc reges alios, ad consimiliter faciendum in suis
legibus, concitasse, omne^ effugit ratione^, cu^ vtriusque lecturae non sit
eadem causa.

THe Prince hearing this, and steadfastly beholding the old man, spoke thus to
him. I know good Chancellor that the book of Deutronomie, whereof you speak,
is a book of holy Scripture: The laws also and ordinances therein contained
are holy, of the Lords making, and published by Moses: Wherefore the reading of
them is a pleasant act of holy contemplation. But that Law, to the knowledge
whereof you counsel me, is humane, made by men, and entreating of worldly
matters: wherefore though Moses bind the Kings of Israel to the reading of
Gods Law, yet that thereby he forces all other Kings (...) do the like in
their own laws, that stands by no good reason, seeing that of both the
readings the cause is not like.

Here the Chauncelour fortifieth his assertion. Chap. 3.
I Perceive (quod the Chancellor) by your answer, most worthy prince, how
earnestly you have considered and weighed the quality of my exhortation: So
that hereby you do much encourage me, both more plainly, more largely, and
also more deeply to discourse ye same. Wherefore you shall understand, that
not only Gods Laws, but also man's, are holy, for so much as the Law is
defined by these words: The law is a holy sanction or decree, commanding things
that be honest, and forbidding the contraries: Now the thing must needs be
holy, which by diffinition is determined to be holy. Right also, by
description is called the Art of that which is good and straight, so that in
this respect a man may well call us Sacerdotes, that is to say, giuers or
teachers of holy things (for so by interpretation does sacerdos signify.)
For So Much then as ye laws are holy, it follows that the ministers and
setters forth of them may right well be called Sacerdotes, that is giuers and
teachers of holy things. Furthermore all laws published by men have also their
authority from God. For as the Apostle says: All power is from ye Lord God.
Wherefore the laws, that are made by man, which thereunto has received power
from the Lord, are also ordained of God, as also appears by this saying of
the Author of all causes: What soever the second cause does the same does the
first cause by a higher and more excellent mean. Wherefore Iosaphat the king
of Judah says to his Judges: The judgments, which ye execute, are the
judgments of God, in the nineteenth Chapter of the second Book of Cronicles.
Whereby you are taught, that to learn Laws, though they be Man's laws, is to
learn holy laws and the ordinances of God: so that the study of them is not
with out a pleasant sweetness of holy co^solatio^. And yet such sweet pleasure
was not the cause, as you suppose, wherefore Moses commanded the kings of
Israel to read the laws of Deuteronomy. For this cause moves not kings no more
then the common sort to ye reading of it, nor to the Book of Deuter. more then
of any of the other books of Moses, in which, as well as in ye book of
Deuteronomy, is plentiful store of godly lesso^s and holy instructions,
wherein to be devoutly occupied is a holy thing. Wherefore yt there was none
other cause of this commandment, the^ for yt ye laws, whereby the king of
Israel is bound to rule his people, are more precisely contained in the Book
of Deutronomie then in the other books of the old testament, the circumstaunces
of the same commandment do manifestly inform us. For which cause you ought,
most worthy Prince, no less then the kings of Israel to be moved and
provoked, to be a diligent trauailer in the study of those laws, where by
hereafter you shall rule your people. For that which was spoken to the king of
Israel, must be understood to be figuratively spoken to every king having
dominion over godly people. And have I not then well and holsomly propounded
unto you the commandment given to the kings of Israel, co^cerni^g the lerning
of their law?

Forasmuch as not only his example, but also his like Authority, has taught
you, and bound you to the like doing in the Laws of the Kingdom, which
Godwilling you shall inherit.

AT Cancellarius. Scio (inquit) per haec quae iam dicis, princeps clarissime,
qua^ta aduerte^tia, ex hortationis meae tu ponderas qualitate^, quo me non
infime co^citas super inceptis ne du^ clarius, sed and profu^dius quoda^modo
^ecu^ disceptare: Scire igitur te volo, quod no^ solu^ Deuteronomy. leges, sed and
omnes leges humanae sacrae sunt, quo lex sub his verbis definitur: Lex est
sanctio sancta, iubens honesta, and prohibens contraria: sanctum etenim esse
oportet, quod esse sanctum definitum est. Ius etiam describi perhibetur, quod
illud est ars boni and aequi, cuius merito quis nos Sacerdotes appellat.
Sacerdos enim, quasi sacra dans, vel sacra docens, per etimologiam dicitur,
quia vt dicunt, iura, leges sacrae sunt quo eas ministrantes and docentes,
Sacerdotes appellantur. A deo etiam sunt omnes leges editae, quae ab homine
promulgantur. Nam cum dicat Apostolus, quod omnis potestas a Domino Deo est,
leges ab homine conditae, qui ad hoc a Domino recipit potestatem, etiam a Deo
constituuntur, dicente Auctore causarum: Quicquid facit causa secunda, facit
and causa prima, altiori and nobiliori modo. Quare Iosaphat Rex Judah, ait
Iudicibus suis: Iudicia, quae vos profertis, iudicia Dei sunt, secundo
Paralipo. xix. Capitul. Ex quibus erudiris, quod leges, licet humanas,
addiscere, est addiscere leges sacras and editiones dei, quo earum studium no^
vacat a dulcedine co^solationis sanctae. Nec tamen, vt tu conjicis, dulcedo
hm^odi cau sa fuit, cur Moses reges Israel Deuteronomy. legere praeceperat. Nam causa
haec, non plus reges qua^ plebeios, ad eius lecturam prouocat, nec plus Deuteronomy.
libru^, qua^ alios Pentateuchi libros legere, pulsat causa ista, cum non minus
libri illi, qua^ Deuteronomy. sacris abundant carismatibus, in quibus meditari
persanctu^ est. Quare non alia^ fuisle causam mandati huius, quam quia in Deuteronomy.
plus quam in alijs libris veteris testamenti, leges inferuntur, quibus rex
Israel populum regere obnoxious est, eiusdem mandati circumsta^tiae manifest
nos informant. Quo, and te, princeps, eadem causa, non minus, quam reges Israel
exhortatur, vt legu^, quibus populum in futuru^ reges, tu sis solers indagator.
Nam, quod regi Israel dictu^ est, omni Regi populi videntis deum, typice dictum
fuisse intelligendu^ est. An tunc non conuenienter vtiliterque proposui tibi
mandatum Regibus Israel latum, de eorum lege addiscenda?

Dum nedu^ eius exemplum, sed and eius auctoritas figuralis, te erudiuit and
obligauit, ad consimiliter faciendu^ de legibus regni, quod annuente Domino
haereditaturus es.

Here the Chancellor proves that a Prince by the laws may be made happy and
blessed. Ca. 4.
NOn solu^ vt deu^ timeas, quo and sapiens eris, princeps colendissime, vocant

est perfectus vsus virtutu^. His ^a^ p^sup positis, co^siderare te volo etia^
ea quae sequentur. Leges humanae no^ aliud sunt qua^ regulae, quibus perfect
iusticia edocetur. Iustitia vero, qua^ leges reuelant, non est illa, quae
co^mutatiua vel distributatiua vocatur, seu alia quaeuis particularis virtus
sed est vir tus perfecta, quae iusticiae legalis nomine designatur. Quam
Leonardus praedictus ideo dicit esse perfecta^, quia omne viciu^ ipsa eliminat,
and omnem virtutem ipsa docet: quo and omnis virtus ipsa merito nuncupatur. De
qua Homerus dicit, similiter and philosophus quinto Ethicoru^, Quod ipsa est
praeclarissima virtutu^, and, nec Lucifer, nec Hesperus, vt illa, est
admirabilis. Iusticia vero haec, subiectum est omnis regalis curae, quo sine
illa Rex just non iudicat, nec recte pugnare potest. Illa vero adepta,
perfecteque seruata, aequissime peragitur omne officium Regis. Vnde cum
perfectus vsus virtutum sit foelicitas, and Iusticia humana, quae non nisi per
legem perfect na^ciscitur, aut docetur, nedum sit virtutum effectus, sed and
omnis virtus: Sequitur, quod iustitia fruens, foelix per legem est, quo and per
eam ipse fit beatus, cum idem sit beatitudo and foelicitas in hac fugaci vita,
^uius and per iustitiam ipse summum habet bonum. Tamen non nisi per gratiam lex
poteritista operari, neque legem aut virtutem sine gratia tu addiscere poteris,
vel appetere. Cum, vt dicit Pariss. in libro suo de Cur Deus homo, virtus
hominis appetetiua interior, per peccatu^ originale ita viciata est, vt sibi
vicioru^ sua^ia, and virtutum aspera opera sapiant. Quare, quod aliqui ad
amorem sectationemque virtutis se conferunt, diuinae bonitatis beneficiu^ est,
and non humanae virtutis. Number tune leges, quae, praeueniente and comitante
gratia, omnia prae^nissa opera^tur, toto conamine addiscendae sunt? dum
faelicitate^, quae secu^dum Philosophos, est hic finis and complementum humani
desiderij, earum apprehensor, obtinebit, quo and beatus ille erit in hac vita,
eius possidens summum bonum. Vere, etsi non haec te moueant, qui regnum
recturus es, mouebunt te and arctabunt ad disciplinatu^ legis Prophetae verba
dicentis: Erudimini, qui iudicatis terram: non enim ad eruditionem artis
factiuae, aut mechanicae, hic mouet Propheta: Cum non dicat, Erudimini, qui
colitis terram, nec ad eruditionem scientiae tantum theoricae, quamuis oportuna
fuerit incolis terrae, quia generaliter non dicit, erudimini qui inhabitatis
terram, sed solum ad disciplinam legis, qua Iudicia redduntur, Reges inuitat
Propheta in his verbis, Cum specialiter ipse dicat: Erudimini, qui iudicatis
terram. Et sequitur: Ne qua^do irascatur Dominus, and pereatis de via iusta.
Nec solum legibus, quibus iustitiam consequeris, (fili Regis) imbui te iubet
sacra Scriptura, sed and ipsam iustitiam diligere, tibi alibi praecipit, cum
dicat: Diligite Iustitiam, qui iudicatis terram, Sapientiae capitulo primo.

NOt only to the intent you should fear God and so become wise, do the Laws
with the Prophet call you saying, Come Children, hear me, I will teach you
the fear of the Lord: but also that you may aspire unto felicity and
blessedness (as far forth as in this life they may be attained) do the Laws
will you, most gracious Prince, to be studious of them. For all the
Philosophers, which have so diversely reasoned of felicity, have al agreed
together in this one point, that felicity or blessedness is the end of all
man's desire, and therefore they call it chief goodness. How be it the
Peripatetikes placed it in Virtue, the Stoikes in Honesty, and the Epicures in
Pleasure. But seeing the Stoikes defined Honesty to be that, which is well
and laudably done with virtue, and the Epicures held nothing to be pleasant
without virtue, therefore al those sects, as says Leonard Aretine in his
Introduction to Moral Philosophy, agreed in this, that it is only virtue that
causes felicity. Wherefore Aristotle also in the 7. book of his politiques
defining Felicity says, that it is the perfect use of Uertues. Thus much
being now presupposed, I would have you to consider these things also that
follow. Man's laws are nothing else but certain rules, whereby Justice is
perfectly taught. But that Justice, which the Laws do show, is not the same
that is called Commutatiue or distributive, or any other particular virtue, but
it is a perfect virtue expressed by the name of Justice legal. Which the
foresaid Leonard does therefore affirm to be perfect, because it excludes all
vice* and teaches all virtue: For which cause also it is worthily called by
the name of all virtue. Whereof Homer says, and likewise Aristotle in the
fifth Book of Moral Philosophy, that it is the chiefest of all virtues, and
that neither Lucifer nor Hesperus are so bright and beaming as it is. Moreover
this justice is the thing whereupon all Princely care depends and rests,
without the which the King can neither rightly judge, nor yet duly fight. But
this being once obtained and perfectly kept, then all the whole duty required in
a king is justly performed. Now then seeing that the perfect use of virtues is
felicity, and that Justice used amongst men, which cannot be obtained unto nor
learned but by the Law, is not only the effect of virtues, but is all virtue
it self: hereof it follows, that the practiser of Justice is by the Law
happy, and so thereby he is made blessed, for so much as blessedness or
happiness and felicity are both one in this short and transitory life, of
the which* life through Justice he enjoys the chief and principal
goodness. And yet the law is not able to perform these things without the
assistaunce of grace, without the which also you cannot learn nor covet either
Law or vextue. For, as says Pariss. in his book entitled Cur deus homo, the
inward virtue of man, wherein his desiring is placed, is so through original
sin defaced and corrupt, that it esteems vicious works for pleasant, and
virtuous works for unpleasant. Wherefore, in that some men apply and endeavor
themselves to the love and following of virtues, it proceeds of the bou^tiful
goodness of God, and not of ye power of man. Is there not the^ special cause
why ye laws, which being prevented, and accompanied with grace, do perform all
the promises, should with all diligent travel be learned? Seeing that who so
has perfectly attained thereunto, the same shall enjoy felicity, the end and
performaunce, as the Philosophers say, of man's desire, by means whereof he shall
in this life be blessed, in ye he now possesses ye chief goodness thereof.
Doubties if these things move you not, which shall have the rule and government
of a kingdom, yet the words of the Prophet shall move you, yea and force you to
the study of the Law, which words be these: Be ye learned you that are
Judges of the Earth: Here the Prophet exhorts not to the learning of a base
art or a handicraft, for he says not: Be ye learned you that are
thinhabiters of the earth, neither does he counsel to the lerning of
knowledge speculatiue, though it be not unnecessary for ye inhabiters upon the
earth, For he says not generally: Be ye learned you that dwell upon the
earth, but by these words does the Prophet call Kings only to the learning of
ye law, whereby judgments are executed, for so much as he specially says, be ye
learned you that are Judges of the earth. And it follows: least the Lord ware
angry, and so you perish from the way of righteousness. Neither does holy
scripture (O kings son) command you only to be skilfully instruct in the
Laws, whereby you shall purchase and obtain the possession of justice, but
also in an other place it bids you unfeignedly to love justice, where it
says: O set your love and affection upon Justice, you that are Judges of the
Earth, in the first chapter of the book of Wisdom.

Ignorance of the Law causes the contempt thereof. Cap. 3.
SEd quomodo iustitiam diligere poteris, si non primo legum scientiam, quibus
ipsa cognoscatur, vtcunque apprehe^deris? Dicit namque Philosophus, quod nihil
amatum nisi cognitum. Quare Fabius Orator ait, Quod felices essent arts, si de
illis soli artifices iudicarent. Ignotum vero non solum non amari, sed and
sperni solet. Quo poeta quidam sic ait. Omnia quae nescit, dicit spernenda
colonus. Etnon coloni solum vox haec est, sed and doctoru^ peritissimo rum
quoque viroru^. Nam si ad Philosophum naturale^ qui in Mathemat. nunquam
studit, metaphisicus dicat, quoth scie^tia sua co^siderat res separatas ab omni
materia and motu secundum esse et secundu^ ratione^: Vel Mathematicus dicat,
quod sua scientia considerat res co^iunctas materiae, and motui, secundu^ esse,
sed separatas secu^du^ ratione^: a^bos hos, licet philosophos, philosophus ille
naturalis qui nunquam noui^ res aliquas separatas a materia and motu, essentia
vel ratione, spernet, eorumque scientias, licet sua scientia nobiliores, ipse
deridebit, non alia ductus causa, nisi quia eorum scientias ipse penitus
ignorant. Sic and tu, Princeps, legis Angliae peritum miraberis, si dicat, quod
frater fratri sibi nequaquam vterino, non succedet in haereditate paterna, sed
potius haereditas illa, sorori integri sanguinis sui descendet, aut capitali
dn^o feodi accidet vt escaeta sua: Cum causam legis huius tu ignores, in lege
tamen Angliae doctu^, huius casus difficultas nullatenus perturbat. Quare and
vulgariter dicitur: quod ars non habet inimicum nisi ignoranten^.

Sed absit a te, fili Regis, vt inimiceris legibus Regni, quo tu successurus
es, vel vt eas spernas, quum iustitiam diligere, praedicta sapientiae lectio te
erudiat. Iterum igitur atque iterum, Princeps inclitissime, te adiuro, vt leges
Regni patris tui, cui successurus es, addiscas. Ne dum vt inconuenientias has
tu euites: Sed quia men's humana, quae naturaliter bonum appetit, and nihil
potest appetere, nisi sub ratione boni, mox vt per doctrinam bonum
apprehenderit, gaudet and illud amat, ac quanto deinceps illud plus recordatur,
tanto amplius delectatur in eodem, quo doceris, quod si leges praedictas quas
iam ignoras, intellexeris per doctrinam, cum optimae illae sint, amabis eos. Et
quanto plus easdem mente pertractaueris, delectabilius tu frueris.

Nam omne, quod amatur, vsu trahit amatorem suum in naturam eius. Vnde, vt
dieit Philosophus, vsus altera fit natura: sic ramunculus pyri, stipiti pomi
insertus, postquam coaluerit, ita pomum trahit in naturam pyri, vt ambae
deinceps, merito pyrus appellentur, fructusque producant pyri, Sic and vsitata
virtus habitum generat, vt vtens ea deinde a virtute illa denominetur, quo
modestia praeditus, vsu modestus nominatur, continentiae continens, and
sapientiae sapiens. Quare and tu princeps, postquam iustitia delectabiliter
functus fueris, habitumque legis indutus fueris, merito denominaberis iustus,
cuius gratia tibi dicetur, Dilexisti iustitiam, quo and odisti iniquitatem,
propterea vnxit te dominus Deus tuus oleo letitiae prae consortibus tuis
regibus terrae.

BUt how can you love Justice, unless you first have a sufficient knowledge in
the laws, whereby the knowledge of it is won and had, for the Philosopher
says, that nothing can be loved except it be known. And therefore
Quintilian the Orator says, That happy should Arts be, if Artificers only
were Judges of them. As for that which is unknown, it is wont not only not to
be loved, but also to be despised. And therefore a certain Poet thus says:
The plowman does despise and skof,
The thing he is not skillful of.
And this is the saying not of Plowmen alone, but also of learned and right
skillful men. For if unto a natural Philosopher, that never st^ided the
Mathematical sciences, a supernatural philosopher should say, that this
Science considers things severed from all matter and moving, according to
their substantial being and reason: or the Mathematical man should say that
this Science considers things joined to matter, and moving, after their
substance, but severed according to reason: both these, though Philosophers,
will the natural Philosopher, which never understood things severed from
matter and motion, either in being or in reason, utterly despise, and their
sciences, though in deed more excellent then his, will he laugh to scorn,
moved so to do by none other cause, but that he is altogether ignorant in
their sciences. Likewise you, most worthy Prince, would wonder at one skillful
in the Laws of England, if he should say, that the brother shall not succeed
his half brother in their Fathers inheritance, but rather his inheritance shall
descend to the sister of the whole blood, or else it shall be entitled to the
chief Lord of the fee as his escheat: Hereat you would much marvel, because
you know not the cause of this law, howbeit the difficulty of this case
nothing troubles him that is learned in ye laws of England. Wherefore it is a
common saying, that an Art has no foe but an ignorant person.

But God forbid, O noble Prince, yt you should be an enemy to the Laws of
that Realm, which you shall by succession inherit: or that you should despise
them, seeing that ye aforecited text of scriptu^e instructs you to the love
of Justice. Wherefore, most Sovereign Prince, I do with most earnest
affection require you to learn the laws of your fathers kingdom, whom you
shall succeed, not only to the intent you may the rather avoid these
inconveniences, but also because man's mind, which naturally desires the thing
that is good, and can desire nothing but in respect that it is good, as soon
as by learning it has taken hold of that which is good, it becomes joyful
and loves the same: and the more that it is afterward occupied in the
remembrance of the same, so much it is more delighted therein: Whereby you are
taught yt if you once by learning attain to ye understanding of ye foresaid
laws, wherein you are now ignorant, seeing they be perfectly good, you must
needs love the^. And ye more yt you record the^ in your mind, so much ye more
delight and pleasure shall you have in the^. For whatsoever it is that is loved,
the same draws the lover of it into the nature thereof. So that as the
Philosopher says, use or exercise becomes an other nature: So a slip of a
Pear tree being graffed into the stock of an Apple tree, after yt it has
taken, it so draws ye apple tree into ye nature of the pear tree, yt they
both for ever after are rightly called a pear tree, and do bring forth the
fruit of a pear tree. In like sort, continual use and practice of virtue
causes a full perfection thereof, in so much that the practiser of the same is
afterward named thereby: as a man endued with modesty, of the use thereof is
named modest, He that uses continency is called continent, and one garnished
with wisdom is called wise. Wherefore you also, most mighty prince, when you
are plesantly delited in Justice, and therewith endued, in respect of the
perfection of the law you shall worthily be called Just, For which cause it
shall be said unto you: Thou have loved Justice and hated iniquity, and
therefore the Lord thy God has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above
the Kings of the earth thy companions.

Here the Chancellor briefly repeateth the effect of all his persuasion.
Cap. 6.
NOw, most gracious Prince, is not all this enough to move your Highness to
the study of the Law? Seeing that thereby you shall indue your self with
Justice, which shall yield unto you the name of a just man, And shall also
eschew the infamy of ignorance in the Law, And further by the Law you
enjoying felicity, shall be blessed in this life, And finally being furnished
with a loving fear, which is the wisdom of God, you shall obtain and
possess Charity, which is a steadfast love to God-warde, and by the mean
thereof cleaving to God, you shall by the Apostles saying, Be made one Spirit
with him.

But forasmuch as the Law without grace cannot accomplish these things, it is
necessary and requisite, that above all things you make earnest intercession
for it: and also that you become a studious sercher of Gods law, and of the holy
scripture. For Scripture says, that all men are vain, in whom is not the
knowledge of God, in the xiij. chapter of the book of Wisdom. Wherefore, most
noble Prince, while you are yet young, and while your soul is as it were a
smooth blanke table, write in it these things, least hereafter you happen to
take pleasure in writing lesso^s of less profit therein.

For as a certain wise man says: Whereof the vessel new, did first receive
the taste,
Therein, when it is old, the sent will ever last.
What handicraftes man does so neglige^tly regard the profit of his child,
whom whiles he is young, he will not see brought up in such an occupation, as
thereby he may afterward obtain to lead a merry life? So ye Carpenter
teaches his son to cut with an axe: the smith to strike with an hammer: and
whom he entendeth to make a spiritual minister, him he procures to be
trained up in learning: So likewise is it convenient, that a Kings son, which
shall govern the people after his father, be in his youth instructed in the
laws. Which order if the Rulers of the world would observe, then the world
should be governed with much more* Justice then now it is, Unto whom, if you
will follow mine exhortation, you shall minister no small example*

NOnne tunc, Princeps serenissime, haec te satis concitant ad legis rudimenta?
cum per ea iustitiam induere valeas: quo and appellaberis iustus, ignorantiae
quoque legis euitare poteris ignominiam: ac per legem foelicitate fruens,
beatus esse poteris in hac vita, and demum filiali timore indutus, qui Dei
sapientia est, charitatem, quae amor in deum est imperturbatus, consequeris,
qua Deo adhaerens, per Apostoli sententiam, Fies vnus spiritus cum eo.

Sed quia ista, sine gratia lex operari nequit, tibi illam super omnia
implorare necesse est, legis quoque diuinae and sanctarum scripturarum indagare
scientiam.

Cum dicat scriptura sacra, quod vani sunt omnes, in quibus non subest scientia
Dei, Sapientiae cap. xiij.

His igitur, Princeps, dum adolescens es, and animatua velut tabula rasa,
depinge eam, ne in futurum ipsa figuris minoris frugi delectabilius depingatur.

Quia etiam (vt Sapiens quidam ait) Quod noua testa capit,
Inueterata sapit.
Quis Artifex tam negligens profectus suae prolis est, vt non eam, dum
pubescit, artibus instruat, quibus postea vitae solatia nansciscatur? Sic
lignarius faber secare dolabro, ferrarius ferire malleo, filium instruit: and
quem in spiritualibus ministrare cupit, literis imbui facit: Sic and principi,
filium suum, qui post eum populum regulabit, legibus instrui, dum minor est
conuenit. Qualiter si fecerint Rectores orbis, mu^dus iste ampliori, quam iam
est, institia regeretur, quibus, si tu, vt iam hortor, facias, exemplum no^
minimum ministrabis.

Now the Prince yields himself to the study of the Laws, though he be yet
disquieted with certain doubts. Cha. 7.
SIlente extunc Cancellario, Princeps ipse sic exorsus est. Vi^^sti me, vir
egregie, suauissima oratione tua, qua and animum meum ardore non minimo, legis
fecisti sitire documenta. Sed tamen duobus, me huc illucque agitantibus, animus
ipse affligitur: vt tanquam in turbido mari Cimba, nesciat quorsum dirigere
proras. Vnu^ est, dum recolit quot annorum curriculis leges addiscentes, earum
studio se conferunt, antequam sufficientem earundem peritiam nanciscantur: quo
timet animus ipse ne consimiliter ego praeteream annos iuuentutis meae. Alterum
est, an Angliae Legum vel Ciuilium, quae per orbem percelebres sunt, studio
operam dabo. Nam non nisi optimis legibus populum regere licet, etiam vt dicit
Philosophus, Natura deprecatur optima, Quare libenter super his, quod tu
consulis, auscultaremus. Cui Cancellarius. Non sunt haec, fili Regis, tantis
celata mysterijs, vt deliberatione egeant ingenti, quare, quid in his mihi
visum est prodere, non differemus.

THus when ye Chancellor had said, he held his peace, to whom the Prince began
on this wise to speak. You have overcome me, well-beloved Chancellor, with
your most pleasant talk, wherewith you have inflamed my mind with a fervent
desire toward the knowledge of the Law. Howbeit two things there be, that
do toss my mind too and fro, and so disquiet it, that like a Ship in the
raging waves it knows not which way to incline for ease. The one is, while it
considers how many years the students of the laws bestow therein before
they can attain to sufficient knowledge of the same: Which causes my mind
also to dread, least that I should likewise spend the years of my youth. The
other is, whether I shall apply my self to the study of the Laws of England,
or of the Civil laws, which through out the whole World are chiefly
esteemed: For people may not be governed but by right good Laws, and as the
Philosopher says, nature coueteth that which is best. Wherefore I would gladly
hear your council in this behalf. To whom the Chancellor made this answer.
These matters, O Kings son, are not hid under so deep and dark mysteries,
that they require any great deliberation, or aduisement. And therefore what I
think best herein I will not hyde

So much knowledge of the Law as is necessary for a Prince, is soon had.
Chap. 8.
ARistotle in the first Book of his natural Philosophy says, that then we
suppose our selves to have the knowledge of every thing, when we know the
causes and beginnings thereof even to the principles, upon the which text the
Commentatour says, that the Philosopher by beginnings or principles did
understand the causes efficient, by the term Causes he understood causes
final, and by Elements, matter and form. But in the Law there are not matter
and form, as in things natural and compound. How be it there be in them
certain Elements, out of ye which they proceed as out of matter and form,
these are customs, statutes, and the Law of nature, of the which all the laws
of the realm have their beginning, even as all natural things have of matter
and form, and as all things that are written and read do consist of letters,
which also are called elements. But principles, or beginnings, which are as the
Commentary says, causes efficient, they are certain universal propositio^s,
which they, that be learned in the Laws of England, and likewise the
Mathematicals do term Maxims: the Rhethoricians do call the same Paradoxes:
and the Ciuilians term them rules of the law. These in deed cannot be proved
by force of arguments, or by demonstrations Logical: But as it is said in the
second book of Posterioum, they are known by induction by the way of sense
and memory. Wherefore in the first book of his natural Philosophy, Aristotle
says, that principles are not made of others, nor one of them of another, but
all other be made of them, And according thereunto in the first book of his
Topikes he writes, that every principle is a sufficient proof of it self.
And therefore the Philosopher says, that such as deny them, ought not to be
disputed or reasoned withal: because that as he writes in the sixth book of
his Moral phylosophie, there is no reason to be given for principles. Wherefore
whatsoever they be that covet to profit in the knowledge of any faculties,
they must needs first be furnished with principles. For by the^ are opened the
causes final, unto the which by y^ direction of reason, through the knowledge
of the principles, we do attain; wherefore these three, viz. Principles,
Causes, and Elements, being unknown, the science, whereof they are, is
altogether unknown. And the same three being known, the science also, whereof
they are, is thought to be known, not determinatly or precisely, but
superficially after a confuse and universal sort.

Thus we think our selves to have the knowledge of Gods Laws, when we
understand our selves to know says, charity, and hope, and also the
Sacraments of the Church, and the Commandments of GOD, leaving to the
Prelates of the Church the other mysteries of Theology. Wherefore the LORD
says unto his Disciples: To you it is given to know the mystery of the
kingdom of GOD, but to others in Parables, that seeing they may not see, etc.
And the Apostle says, Not to be wiser, then it behooves. And in an other
place, Not being high in wisdom. In like manner, O most worthy Prince, it
shall not be needful for you with long study to search out the secret
mysteries of the Law of England, It shall suffice for you, as you have profited
in grammar, so also to profit in Law, Unto the perfection of Grammar, springing
out of Etimologie, Orthographie, Prosodie, and Construction, as out of four
fountains, you have not exactly attained* and yet you are so sufficiently
grounded in grammar, that you may well be called a Grammarian. Likewise shall
you be well worthy to be called a Lawier, if you search out the principles
and causes of the Laws, even to the elements, after the manner of a scholar or
a learner. For it shall not be needful or expedient for you by the travel of
your own wit, to study out the hid mysteries of the Law, But let that gear
be left to your Judges and men of law, which in the Realm of England are
called Serieants at Law, and to other professors of ye Law commonly called
Apprentices: For you shall better execute judgments by other, then by your
self: Neither has it been seen that any King of England has pronounced
judgment with his own mouth, And yet nevertheless ye judgments of the Realm
are his, though by other they be uttered and pronounced, Like as also King
Iosaphat affirmed the sentences of all the Judges to be the judgments of God.
Wherefore, most gracious Prince, you shall in short time with little labor be
sufficiently learned in the Laws of England, so that you do apply your mind
to the optaining thereof. For Seneca in an Epistle to Lucillus, says: There is
nothing which earnest travel and diligent care atchiueth not. And so well do
I know the prompt towardness of your nature, that I dare be bold to say,
that in those Laws (though the exact knowledge of them such as is required in
judges can skant be gotten in the space of xx. years) you shall sufficiently
in one year attain to so much understanding as is convenient for a prince.
Neither in the mean time shall you neglect and omit the study of martial
discipline, whereunto you are so fervently given, but during all the same year
in stead of recreatio^ you shall use the practice thereof at you pleasure.

PHilosophus in primo Phisicorum dicit, quod Tunc vnumquodque scire arbitramur,
cum causas and principia eius cognoscamus vsque ad elementa. Super quem textum
commentator dicit, quod Aristoteles per principia intellexit causas
efficientes, per causas intellexit causas finales, and per Elementa materiam
and formam. In Legibus vero non sunt materia and forma, vt in Phisicis and
compositis. Sed tamen sunt in eis Elementa quaedam, vnde ip sae profluunt* vt
ex materia and forma, quae sunt consuetudines, statuta, and ius naturae, ex
quibus sunt omnia iura regni, vt ex materia and forma sunt quaeque naturalia:
and vt ex literis, quae etiam elementa appellantur, sunt omnia quae leguntur.
Principia autem, quae Commentator dicit esse causas efficientes, sunt quaedam
vniuersalia, quae in legibus Angliae docti, similiter and Mathematici, Maximas
vocant: Rethorici, Paradoxas: and Ciuilistae, Regulas iuris denominant. Ipsa
reuera non arg^mentorum vi, aut demonstrationibus logicis dignoscuntur: Sed vt
secundo Posteriorum docetur, inductione, via sensus and memoriae, adipiscuntur.
Quare and primo Phisicorum phylosophus dicit, quod principia non fiunt ex
alijs, neque ex alterutris, sed ex illis alia fiunt, quo primo Topicoru^
scribitur, quod vnumquodque principiorum est sibi ipsi fides. Vnde, cum
nega^tibus ea, dicit Phylosopus, non est disputandum: quia, vt scribitur vj.
Ethicorum, ad principia non est ratio. Igitur principijs imbuendi sunt, quiqui
gliscunt aliquas intelligere facultates. Ex eis etenim, reuelantur causae
finales, ad quas, rationis ductu, per principiorum agnitionem, peruenitur;
vnde, his tribus, videlicet, Principijs, Causis, and Elementis ignoratis,
scientia, de qua ipsa sunt, penitus ignoratur. Et his cognitis, etiam scientiam
illam cognitam esse, non determinate, sed in confuso and vniuersaliter
arbitratur.

Sic Legem diuinam nos nosse indicamus, dum fidem, charitatem, and spem,
sacramenta quoque Ecclesiae ac Dei mandata, nos intelligere sentiamus; cetera
Theologiae mysteria Ecclesiae presidentibus relinquentes. Quare dominus
discipulis suis ait: Vobis datum est nosse mysterium regni Dei, caeteris autem
in parabolis, vt videntes non videant, etc. Et Apostolus dixit, non plus sapere
quam oportet sapere. Et alibi, non alta sapientes. Sic and tibi, Princeps,
necesse non erit misteria legis Angliae longo disciplinatu rimare, sufficient
tibi, vt in Grammatica tu pro^^cisti, etiam and in legibus proficias.
Gammaticae vero perfectionem, quae ex Ethimologia^, Ortographia, Prosodia, and
Syntaxi, quasi ex quatuor fontibus profluit, non specie tenus induisti, and
tamen gra^matica sufficienter eruditus es, ita vt merito gra^maticus
denomineris. Consimiliter quoque denominari legista mereberis, si legum
principia and causas, vsq ad elementa, discipuli more indagaueris. Non enim
expediet tibi, propria sensus indagine, legis sacramenta rimare, sed
relinqua^tur illa iudicibus tuis and aduocatis, qui in regno Angliae seruientes
ad legem appellantur similiter and allis peritis, quos Apprenticios vulgus
denominat: melius enim per alios, quam per teipsum iudicia reddes, quo, proprio
ore, nullus regum Angliae iudicium proferre vsus est, and tamen sua sunt omnia
iudicia regni licet per alios ipsa redda^tur, sicut and Iudicu^ omnium
sententias, Iosaphat asseruit esse iudicia dei. Quare, tu princeps serenissime,
paruo te^pore, parua industria, sufficienter eris in legibus regni Angliae
eruditus, dummodo ad eius apprehensionem tu co^feras animu^ tuu^. Dicit na^que
Seneca in epistola ad Lucillum: Nil est quoth pertinax opera, and diligens cura,
no^ expugnat. Nosco namque ingenij cui per^picacitate^, quo audacter pronuncio,
quoth in legibus illis, licet earum peritia, qualis iudicibus necessaria est, vix,
xx. annorum lucubrationibus acquiratur, tu doctrinam Principi congruam in anno
vno sufficienter nancisceris, nec interim militarem disciplinam, ad quam tam
ardenter anhelas, negliges, sed ea, recreationis loco, etiam anno illo, tu ad
libitum perfrueris.

A King, whose government is politic, cannot change the Laws of his Realm.
Chap. 9^
THe second point, most worthy prince, whereof you stand in fear, shall in like
manner, and as easily as the other, be confuted. For you stand in doubt, whether
it be better for you, to give your mind to the study of the laws of England,
or of the Civil laws, because they thorowout the whole world are advanced in
glory and renown above all other man's laws. Let not this scruple of mind
trouble you, O most noble Prince: For the king of England cannot alter nor
change the laws of his Realm at his pleasure. For why, he governs his
people by power, not only royal, but also politic. If his power over the^
were roial only, the^ he might change the laws of his realm, and charge his
subjects with Tallage and other burdens without their consent, and such is the
dominion that the civil Law purporte, when they say, The Prince his pleasure
has the force of a Law. But from this, much differs the power of a King,
whose government over his people is politic, For he can neither change Laws
without the consent of his subjects, nor yet charge them with strange
impositions against their wills. Wherefore his people do franckly and freely
enjoy and occupy their own goods, being ruled by such laws as they themselves
desire, Neither are they pilled either of their own king or of any other, Like
pleasure also and freedom have the subjects of a king ruling only by power
royal, so long as he falls not into tyranny. Of such a King speaks
Aristotle in the third Book of his Civil Philosophy, saying, that it is
better for a City to be governed by a good King, then by a good Law. But
forasmuch as a King is not ever such a man, therefore Saint Thomas in the
Book, which he wrote to the King of Cyprus, Of the governance of Princes,
wishes the state of a Realm to be such, that it may not be in the kings
power to oppress his people with tyranny, Which thing is performed only,
while the power Royal is restrained by power politic. Rejoice therefore, O
sovereign Prince, and be glad, that the Law of your Realm, wherein you
shall succeed, is such, For it shall exhibit and minister to you and your
people no small security and comfort. With such Laws as says the same St.
Thomas should al man kind have been governed, if in Paradise they had not
tra^sgressed Gods commandment, with such Laws also was the Sinagogue ruled,
while it served under God only as King, who adopted the same to him for a
peculiar kingdom, But at the last, when at their request they had a man king
set over them, they were then under royal Laws only brought very low, And
yet under the same Laws, while good Kings were their Rulers: they lived
wealthily, and when wilful and tyrannous Kings had the government of them,
then they continued in great discomfort and misery, as the book of Kings does
more plainly declare. But for so much, as I suppose, I have sufficiently
debated this matter in my work which at your request I compiled of the nature
of the law of nature, therefore at this time I surcease to speak thereof any
more.

SEcundum vero, Princeps, quod tu formidas, consimili nec maiori opera
elidetur. Dubitas ne^pe, an Anglorum legum, vel ciuilium studio te conferas,
dum Ciuiles supra humanas cunctas leges alias, fama per orbem extollat
gloriosa. Non te conturbet, fili Regis, haec mentis euagatio: Nam non potest
rex Angliae, ad libitum suum, leges mutare regni sui. Prineipatu namque, nedum
regali, sed and politico, ipse suo populo dominatur. Si regali tantum ipse
praeesset eis, Leges regni sui mutare ille posset, Tallagia quoque and caetera
onera eis imponere ipsis inconsultis, quale dominiu^ denotant leges ciuiles,
cum dicant quoth principi placuit, legis habet vigorem. Sed long aliter potest
Rex, politice impera^s genti suae, quia nec leges ipse sine subditorum assensu
mutare poterit, nec subiectum populum renitente^ onerare impositionibus
peregrinis, quare populus eius libere fruetur bonis suis, legibus, quas cupit
regulatus, nec per Regem suum, aut quemuis alium depilatur, consimi^liter tamen
plaudit populus, sub Rege regalit tantum principante, dummodo ipse in
tyrannidem non labatur. De quali rege dicit philosophus iij. politicoru^, quod
melius est Ciuitatem regi viro optimo, quam lege optima. Sed quia non semper
contingit praesidente^ populo, huiusmodi esse virum, sanctus Thomas in libro,
quem Regi Cipri scripsi^, de tegmine principum, optare censetur, regnu^ sic
institui, vt rex non libere valeat populum tyrannide gubernare, quod solum fit,
dum potestas Regia lege politica cohibetur: Gaude igitur, princeps optime,
talem esse legem regni, in quo tu successurus es, quia, and tibi, and populo,
ipsa securitatem praestabit non minima^ and solamen. T^li lege, ut dicit idem
sanctus, regulatu^ fuisse totu^ genus humanum, si in paradi^o Dei mandatu^ non
praeterijsset tali etia^ lege regebatur Sinagoga, dum sub solo Deo, Rege, qui,
eam in regnum peculiare adoptabat, illa militaba^, sed demum eius petitione,
rege homine sibi constituto, sub lege tantum regali ipsa deinceps humiliata
est. Sub qua tamen, dum optimi Reges sibi praesuerunt, ipsa plausit, and dum
discoli ei praeessebant, ipsa inco^solabiliter lugebat, vt regum liber haec
distinctus manifestauit. Tamen quia de materia ista in opus culo, quod tui
contemplatione de natura legis naturae exaraui, sufficienter puto me
desceptasse, plus inde loqui iam desisto.

Here the Prince demands a question. Cha. 10.
TVnc princeps il lico sic ait. Vnde hoc cancellarie, quod Rex vnus plebem suam
regaliter tantu^ regere valeat, and regi alteri potestas huiusmodi denegatur,
aequalis fastigij cum sint Reges ambo, cur in potestate sint ipsi dispares
nequeo non admirari.

Immediately the Prince thus said. How comes this to pass, good Chancellor,
that one King may govern his people by power Royal only, and that another
king can have no such power, seeing both these Kings are in dignity equal, I
cannot chose but much muse and marvel why in power they should thus differ.

The answer to this question is here omitted, for that in an another work it
is handled at large. Chap. 11.
I Have sufficiently, quod the Chancellor, declared in my foresaid work, that
the King, whose government is politic, is of no less power, the^ he that
royally rules his people after his own pleasure, howbeit they differ in
aucthority over their subjects, as in the same work I have showed, and say I
still. Of which difference I will open unto you the cause as I can.

CAncellarius. No^ minoris esse potestatis, rege^ politice imperantem, qua^
qui, vt vult, regaliter regit populu^ suu^, in supradicto opusculo sufficie^ter

How kingdoms ruled by royal government only first began. Chap. 12.
Men in times passed, excelling in power, gredy of dignity and glory, did
many times by plain force subdue unto them their neighbors ye nations
adjoining: and compelled the^ to do them service and to obey their
commandments, which commandments afterward they decreed to be unto those
people very laws. And by long suffera^ce of the same, the people so subdued,
being by their subduers defended from ye injuries of other, agreed and
consented to live under the dominion of the same their subduers, thinking it
better for the^ to be under the empire of one man, which might be able to
defend the^ against other, then to be in danger to be oppressed of all such
as would violently offer them any wrong. And thus certain kingdoms were
begun, And those subduers thus ruling the people unto them subdued, took upon
them of ruling to be called rulers, which our language terms kings, And
their rule or dominion was named only royal or kingly. So Nemroth was the
first that got unto himself a Kingdom, And yet in the holy Scriptures he is
not called a King, but a stout and mighty hunter before the Lord: For like as
a Hunter subdueth wild beasts living at their liberty: so did he bring men
under his obedience. So did Belus subdue the Assirians, and Ninns the most part
of Asia. So also did the Romans usurp the Empire of the whole world, and thus
almost were the kingdoms of all nations begun. Wherefore ye Lord, being
displesed with ye children of Israel requiring to have a king, as the^ al other
nations had, commanded the law regal to be declared unto the^ by the Prophet.
Which law regal was no other thing, but the pleasure of the king their
governor, as in ye 1. book of the kings more fully it is contained. Now you
under stand, as I suppose, most noble Prince, the form and fashion of ye
beginning of those kingdoms, yt be regally possessed and ruled. Wherefore, now
I will assay to make plain to you, how and by what means ye government of ye
kingdom politic, took his first entrance and beginning, to the end and
intent, that when you know the beginnings of them both, it may be right easy
for you thereby to discern the cause of the diversity, which in your question
is contained.

HOmines quo^dam, potentia praepollentes, auidi dignitatis and gloriae, vicinas
saepe gentes sibi viribus subiugarunt, ac ipsis seruire obtemperare quoque
iussionibus suis co^puleru^t, quas iussiones extunc leges ho minibus illis esse
ipsi sancieru^t. Quarum perpetione d^utina, subiectus sic populus, du^ per
subijcie^tes a ceteroru^ iniurijs defe^debatur, in subijcie^tium dominiu^
consentierunt: Oportunius esse arbitra^tes, se vnius subdi imperio, quo erga
alios defendere^tur, quam omnium eos infestare volentium oppressionibus exponi.
Sicque regna quaedam inchoata sunt, and subijcientes illi, dum subiectum
populum sic rexerunt, a regaendo sibi nomen regis vsucparunt, eorum quoque
dominatus tantum regalis dictus est. Sic Ne^broth primus sibi regnum
co^parauit, tamen non rex, ipse, sed Robustut venator coram domino sacris
litteris appellatus est: Quia vt v^nator feras liberate frue^tes, ipso ho
mines sibi compescuit obedire. Sic Belus Assyrias: and Ninus quam magnam Afiae
partem, ditioni suae subegerunt. Sic and Ronani orbis imperium vsurparunt
qualiter fere in omnibus ge^tibus regna inchoata sunt. Quare, dum filij Israel
rege^ postulabant, sicut tunc habuerunt omnes gentes, dominus inde offensus,
legem regale^ eis per Prophetam explanari mandauit. Quae no^ aliud fuit, quam
pla citum regis eis praeessentis, vt in primo Regum libro before edoceretur.
Ha bes nunc (ni fallor) Princeps clarissime, forma^ exordij regnoru^, regaliter
possessorum. Quare, quomodo regnum politice regulatum, primitus erupit, etiam
iam propalare conabor, vt cognitis amborum regnorum initijs, causam
diuersitatis, quam tu quaeris, inde elicere tibi facillimum sit.

How Kingdoms of politic governance were first begun. Chap. 13.
SAint Augustine in the xxiii. chapter of his xix book de Ciuitate Dei, says,
That a people is a multitude of men associated by the consent of law, and
communion of wealth. And yet such a people being headless, that is to say,
without a head, is not worthy to be called a body. For as in things natural,
when the head is cut off, the residue is not called a body but a truncheon, so
likewise in things polititique, a communaltie without a head is in no wise
corporate: Wherefore, Aristotle in the first book of his civil philosophy
says, that whenever one is made of many, among the same, one shall be the
ruler, and the other shall be ruled, wherefore a people that will raise
themselves into a kingdom, or into any other body politic, must ever
appoint one to be chief ruler of the whole body, which in kingdoms is called
a King. And this kind of order, as out of the embrion rises a body natural,
ruled by one head, even so of a multitude of people arises a kingdom, which
is a body mystical, grounded by one man as by an head And like as in a
natural body, as says the Philosopher, the heart is the first that lives,
having within it blood, which it distributeth among all the other members,
whereby they are quickened and do live: semblably in a body politic, the
intent of the people is the first lively thing, having within it blood, that is
to say, polititique provision for the utility and wealth of the same people,
which it deals forth and imparteth as well to the head as to all the members
of the same body, whereby the body is nourished and maintained. Furthermore
the law under the which a multitude of men is made a people, represents ye
semblance of sinews in the body natural: because that like as by sinews the
joining of the body is made sound, so by the Law, which takes the name a
liga^do, that is, to wit of binding, such a mistical body is knit and preserved
together: and the members and bones of ye same body, whereby is represented the
soundnes of ye wealth whereby ye body is sustained, do by the laws, as the
natural body by sinews, retein every one their proper functions: And as the
head of a body natural cannot change his sinews, nor cannot deny or wthold
from his inferior members their peculiar powers, and several nourishments of
blood, no more can a king, which is the head of a body politic, change the
Laws of that body, nor withdraw from the same people their proper substance
against their wills and consentes in that behalf. Now you understand, most
noble Prince, the form of institution of a Kingdom politic, whereby you may
measure the power, which the King thereof may exercise over the Law and
subjects of the same. For such a king is made and ordained for the defenc^ of
the law of his subjects and of their bodies, and goods, whereunto he receives
power of his people, so that he can not govern his people by any other power.
Wherefore to satisfy your request, in that you desire to be certified, how it
comes to pass that in the powers of Kings there is so great diversity:
Surely in mine opinion the diversity of the institutions or first ordinances of
those dignities, which I have now declared, is the only cause of this
foresaid difference, as of the premises by the discourse of reason you may
easily gather. For thus the Kingdom of England out of Brutes retinue of the
Troyanes, which he brought out of the Coasts of Italy and Greece, first
grew to a politic and regal dominion: Thus also Scotland, which sometime
was subject to England as a Dukedom thereof, was advanced to a politic and
royal Kingdom. Many other kingdoms also had thus their first beginning not
only of regal but also of politic government. Wherefore Diodorus Siculus in
his second book of old histories, thus writes of the Egyptians: The Egyiptian
kings lived first, not after the licentious manner of other rulers, whose will
and pleasure is in stead of law, but they kept themselves as private persons
in subjection of the laws, And this did they willingly, being persuaded that by
obeying the laws they should be blessed. For of such rulers, as followed
their own lusts, they supposed many things to be done, whereby they were
brought in danger of diverse harms and perils. And in his fourth Book thus he
writes: The Ethiopian king as soon as he is created, he orders his life
according to the laws, and does al things after the manner and custom of his
country, assigning neither reward nor punishment to any man, other then the
law made by his predecessors appoints. He reports likewise of the king of
Saba in Arabia the happy, and of certain other kings which in old time
honorably reigned.

SAnctus Augustinus in libro xix. de Ciuitate Dei, cap. xxiij. dicit, Quod
populus est caetus hominu^, iuris consensu and vtilitatis co^munione sociatus.
Nec tame^ populus hm^odi dux acephalus, (.i.) sine capite, esse corpus vocari
meretur. Quia vt in naturalibus, capite detru^cato, residuu^ non corpus, sed
truncum ap pellamus, sic and in politicis, sine capite communitas nullatenus
corporatur: Quo, primo polit. dicit Philosophus, quod qua^docunque ex pluribus
constituitur vnu^ inter illa, vnum erit regens, and alia eru^trecta, Quare
populum se in regnu^ aliunde corpus politicum erigere volente^, semper oportet
vnum praeficere totius corporis illius regitiuum, quem Regem nominare solitu^
est. Hoc ordine, sicut ex embrione corpus surgit phisicum, vno capite
regulatum, sic ex populo eru^pit regnum, number, quod corpus extat mysticu^ vno
homine vt capite gubernatum. Et sicut in naturali corpore, vt dicit
Philosophus, cor est primu^ viuens, habens in se sanguine^, que^ emittit in
omnia eius membra, vnde illa vegeta^tur and viuunt: sic in corpore politico
inte^sio populi primum viuidum est, habens in se sanguinem, viz. prouisione^
politicam vtilitati populi illius, qua^ in caput and in omnia membra eiusdem
corporis, ipsa transmittit, quo corhus illud alitur and vegetatur. Lex vero sub
qua caetus hominum, po pulus efficitur, neruoru^ corporis phisici tenet
rationem: Quia sicut per neruos compago corporis solidatur, sic per legem, quae
a ligando dicitur, corpus huiusmodi misticu^ ligatur and seruatur in vnu^, and
eius de^ corporis me^bra acossa, quaeveritatis qua co^munitas illa suste^tatur,
soliditate^ denotant, per lege^, vt corpus natural per neuos propria, retinent
iura: Et vt no^ potest caput cor porisphisici, neruos suos co^mutare, neque
me^bris suis pro prias vires, and propria sanguinis alime^ta denegare, nec rex,
qui caput corporis polici est, mutare potest leges corporis illius, nec eiusde^
populi substa^tias proprias sub trahere, reclamantibus eis aut inuitis. Habes
ex hoc iam, princeps^, instituti omnis politici regni forma^, ex qua metiri
poteris potestate^, qua^ Rex eius in leges ipsius, aut subdi tos valeat
exercere. Ad tutela^ na^que legis subditoru^, ac eoru^ corporu^, and bonoru^,

habet, quo ei non licet potestate alia suo populo dominari: quare vt

obediuit, in regnu^ creuit politicu^ and regale. Alia quoque plurima regna,
nedu^ regaliter sed and politice regulari, tali origin ius sortita sunt. Vnde
Diodorus Siculus in secundo libro historiaru^ priscarum de Egyptijs, sic
scribit: suam primum Egyptij reges vitam non aliorum regnantium, quibus
voluntas pro lege est, traducebant licentia, sed veluti priuati tenebantur
legibus, neque id egre ferebant, existimantes parendo legibus, se beatos fore.
Nam ab his, qui suis indulgerent cupiditatibus, multa censebant fieri, quibus
dampna periculaque subirent. Et in quarto libro sic scribit: Assumptus in Regem
Ethiopum, vitam ducit statutam legibus omniaque agit iuxta patrios mores, neque
premio, neque pena afficiens quenquam, praeter per traditam a superioribus
legem. Consimiliter loquitur de rege Saba in foelici Arabia, and alijs
quibusdam regibus qui priscis temporibus feliciter regnaba^t.

Here the Prince compendiously abridgeth all that the Chauncellor before has
discoursed at large. Cha. 14.
CVi Princeps, Effugasti, Can cellarie, declarationis tuae lumine tenebras,
quibus obducta erat acies me^tis meae, quo clarissime iam conspicio, quod non
alio pacto gens aliqua, proprio arbitrio, vnquam se in regnum corporauit, nisi
vt per hoc, se and sua, quorum dispendia formidabant, tutius quam antea
possiderent, quasi proposito ge^s huiusmodi fraudaretur, si exinde facultates
eorum eripere possit Rex suus, quod antea facere vlli hominum no^ licebat. Et
adhuc grauius multo populus talis laederetur, si deinde peregrinis legibus,
etiam ipsis forsan exosis, regerentur. Et maxim, si legibus illis, eorum
minoraretur substantia, pro cuius vita^da iactura, vt pro suorum tutela
corporum, ipsi se Regis imperio, arbitrio proprio, submiserunt, non potuit
reuera potestas huiusmodi ab ipsis erupisle: and tamen si non ab ipsis, Rex
huiusmodi super ipsos nullam obtineret potestatem. E regione, aliter esse
concipio de regno, quod Regis solum auctoritate and potentia incorporatum est,
qui non alio pacto ge^s talis ei subiecta est, nisi vt eius legibus, quae sunt
illius placita, gens ipsa, quae eodem placito regnum eius effecta est,
obtemperaret and regeretur. Neque, Cancellarie, a mea hucusque memoria elapsum
est, quod alias in tractatu de natura legis naturae, horum duoru^ regu^
aequalem esse pote^tiam, doctis rationibus ostendisti, dum potestas, qua eoru^
alter perperam agere liber est, liberate hm^di no^ augetur, vt posse
languescere, moriue, potentia no^ est, sed propter priuationes inadiecto,
impotentia potius denominandum. Quia vt dicit Boethius, potentia non est nisi ad
bonum, quod posse male agere, vt potest Rex regaliter regnans, liberius quam
Rex politice dominans populo suo, poti us eius potestatem miniut, quam
augmentat. Nam sancti spiritus, iam confirmati in gloria, qui peccare nequeunt
potentiores nobis sunt, qui ad omne facinus liberis gaudemus habenis. Solum
igitur mihi iam superest a te sciscitandum, si Lex Angliae, ad cuius
disciplina^um me prouocas, bona and efficax est ad regimen regni illius, vt lex
ciuilis, quasacrum regulatur imperiu^* sufficiens arbitratur ad orbis regimen
vniuersi? Si me in hoc, demonstrationibus congruis, indubium reddideris, ad
studiu^ legis illius ilico me co^^era^ nec te postulatio nibus meis super his,
amplius fatigabo.

TO whom the Prince thus answered. You have, good Chancellor, with the clear
light of your declaration quite driven away the cloudy mist, wherewith the
brightness of my mind was darkened: so that I do most evidently see that no
nation did ever of their own voluntary mind incorporate themselves into a
kingdom for any other intent, but only to the end, yt thereby they might with
more safety then before maintain the^ selves, and enjoy their goods from such
misfortunes and losses as they stood in fear of, And of this intent should such
a nation be utterly defrauded, if then their king might spoil them of their
goods, which before was lawful for no man to do. And yet should such a people
be much more injured, if they should afterward be governed by foreign and
strange Laws, yea and such as they peradventure deadly hated and abhorred.
And most of all, if by those Laws, their substance should be diminished, for
the safeguard whereof, as also for the defense of their own bodies, they of
their own free will submitted themselves to the governance of a King, no such
power surely could have proceeded from them: And yet if they had not been,
such a King could have had no power over them. Now on the other side I perceive
it to stand much otherwise with a kingdom, which only by the authority of
a king is incorporate, For such a Nation is no otherwise subject unto him, but
that the same Nation which by his pleasure is made his kingdom, should obey
his Laws, and be ruled by the same being nothing else but his like pleasure.
Neither have I yet, good Chancellor, forgotten that, which in your treatise
of the nature of the Law of Nature, you have with pithie reasons clarkely
proved: concerning that the power of these two kings is equal. Howbeit ye
power of the one, whereby he is at liberty to deal wrongfully, is not by such
liberty augmented and increased, as to be of ability to decay and die, is no
hability, but in respect of ye privation and feebleness in the thing, it is
rather to be called a dishabilitie. Because that as Boethius says: hability and
power is not but to good: So that to be of ability or power to do evil,
(as is the king that Regally does rule, and that with much more liberty, then
the King that has a politic dominion over his people) is rather a diminution
then an increase of power. For the holy spirits, which are now established in
glory, and cannot sin, do in power far excel and pass us which have a
delight and pleasure to run headlo^g into all kind of wickedness. Now therefore
I have but this one only question to demand of you, whether the law of
England, to the study whereof you exhort me, be as good and effectual for the
government of that kingdom, as the Civil law, whereby the holy empire is
gouernned, is thought sufficient for the government of the whole world? If with
sound reasons and apparent demonstrations you resolve me in this point, I will
straight yield me to the study of the Law, without further troubling you
with my questions in this matter.

That all Laws are the law of nature, customs, or statutes. Chap. 15.
THe Cha^celor answered saying: you have well committed to memory, most worthy
Prince, all that I have hitherto declared unto you, Wherefore you are well
worthy to have this doubt opened, whereupon now you have moved your question.
You shall therefore understand, that all humane Laws are either the Law of
nature, or customs, or else statutes, which are also called constitutions. But
customs and the sentences of the Law of nature, after that they were once put
in writing, and by the sufficient authority of the Prince published and
commanded to be kept were changed into the nature of constitutions, or
statutes, and did after that more penally, then before, bind the subjects of
the Prince to the keeping of the^, by the severity of his commandment, Of
this sort are the most part of the Civil laws, which of the Roman Princes
are digested in great volumes and by their authority commanded to be
observed. And not they only are called by the name of the Civil Law, but also
all the other statutes of Emperors. Now then, if that among these three
welsprings of all Law, I prove the preeminence of the Law of England to excel
above the rest: I shall therewith prove the same Law to be good and effectual
for the government of the kingdom. And further, if I do show it to be as
commodious for the wealth of that Realm, as the Civil Laws are for the
wealth of the Empire, then shall I make evident and plain not only yt this law
is of much excellency, but also that it is an elect and chosen law, as well as
the Civil laws are: which is ye thing that you require. Wherefore to the
proof and declaration of these ij. points, thus I proceed.

CAncellarius, memoriae tuae, Princeps optime, commendasti, quae tibi hucusque
suggessi, quare and quae iam interrogas, meritus es vt pandam. Scire te igitur
volo, quod omnia iura humana, aut sunt lex naturae, consuetudines, vel statuta,
quae and constitutiones appellantur. Sed consuetudines and legis naturae

voluminibus redigitur, and eorum auctoritate obseruari ma^datur* Vnde legis
Ciuilis, vt caetera Imperatoru^ statuta, iam pars illa nomen sortita est, Si
igitur in his tribus quasi omnis iuris fontibus, legis Angliae praestantia^

regimen, etiam comprobaui. Deinde si eam, ad eiusdem regni vtilitatem, vt leges
ciuiles ad imperij bonum, accommodam esse lucide ostenderim, nedum tunc legem
illam praestante^, sed and, vt leges ciuiles, electam (vt tu optas) etiam
patefeci. Igitur haec duo tibi ostendere satagens, sic progredior.

The Law of nature in all countries, is all one. Chap. 16.
LEges Angliae in his, quae ipsae sa^ciu^t legis naturae ratione, non meliores
peioresue sunt in iudicijs suis, qua^ in co^similibus sunt omnes leges
caeterarum nationu^. Quia, vt dicit Philosophus 5. Ethicoru^: Ius natural est,
quod apud omnes homines eandem habet potentiam, quare de ea amplius disceptare
non expedit. Sed quales sunt Angliae co^suetudines similiter and statuta, est
amodo perscruta^du^, and primo consue^udinu^ illarum visitabimus qualitates.

THe laws of Englad, in those things, which they by force of the Law of nature
do ratify and establish, are neither better nor worse in their judgments,
then the laws of all other nations are in ye like cases. For as Aristotle in
the 5. book of his Moral Philosophy says: The Law of nature is that which
among all people has like strength and power, wherefore hereof to reason any
longer it shall not avail. But now henceforth we will search out what manner
of Customs and Statutes these of England are. And first the quallitie of those
customs we will consider.

The Customs of England are of most ancient antiquity, practiced and received
of v. several Nations, from one to another, by succession. Chap. 17.
THe Realm of England, was first inhabited of the Britons, next after them the
Romans had the rule of the land and then again the Britons possessed it,
after whom the Saxons invaded it, who changing the name thereof did for
Britain call it England, after then for a certain time the Danes had the
dominion of the Realm, and then Saxons again, but last of all the Normans
subdued it, whose descent continues in the government of the kingdom at this
present. And in all the times of these several nations and of their kings, this
realm was still ruled with the self same customs, that it is now governed
withal. Which, if they had not been right good, some of those kings moved
either with Justice, or with reason or affection, would have changed the^, or
else altogether abolished them, and especially the Romans, who did judge all the
rest of the world by their own laws. Likewise would other of ye ^oresaid
kings have done, which by the sword, only possessing the realm of England,
might by the like power and aucthority have extinguished the Laws thereof. And
touching the antiquity of the same, neither are the Roman Civil laws, by so
long continuance of ancient times, confirmed, nor yet ye Laws of ye Venetia^s,
which, above al other are reported to be of most antiquity, for so much as their
Ila^d in ye beginning of ye Britons was not the^ inhabited, as Rome then also
vnbuilded, neither ye laws of any Paynim nation of ye world, are of so old and
ancient years: Wherefore the contrary is not to be said nor thought, but that
the English customs are very good, yea of all other the very best.

Here he shows with what gravity Statutes are made in England. Chap. 18.
STatuta tunc Angloru^, bona sint necne, solum restat explorandum. Non enim
emanant illa a principis solum voluntate, vt leges in regnis, quae tantum
regaliter gubernantur, vbi quandoque statuta ita constituentis procurant
co^modum singular, quod in eius subditoru^ ipsa redundant dispendium, and
iacturam: Quandoque etiam inaduerte^tia principu^ huiusmodi, and sibi
consulentium inertia, ipsa tam inconsulte edu^tur, quoth corruptelarum nomina
potius, qua^ legum, illa merentur. Sed non sic Angliae statuta oriri possunt,
dum nedum principis voluntate, sed and totius regni assensu, ipsa conduntur,
quo populi laesura^ illa efficere nequeunt, vel non eoru^ co^modu^ procurare.
Prudentia, etia^ and sapientia necessario ipsa esse referta putandu^ est, dum
non vnius, aut centu^ solu^ consultoru^ viroru^ prudentia, sed plusqua^
trecentoru^ electorum hominum, quali numero olim senatus Romanoru^, regebatur,
ipsa editasu^t, vt hij qui par liame^ti Angliae forma^, conuocationis quoque
eius ordinem and modum, nouerunt, haec distinctius refer noru^t. Et si
statuta haec, tanta solemnitate and prudentia edita, efficatiae tantae, quantae
co^ditoru^ cupieba^ intentio, non esse continga^t: concito reformari ipsa
possunt, and non sine co^munitatis and procerum regni illius asse^su, quali
ipsa primitus emanaru^t: pate^t igitur iam tibi, princeps, legum anglorum
species omnes. Earum quoque qualitates, vt si bonae ipsae sint, metiri tu
poteris prudentia tua, comparatione etiam aliarum legum: and cum nullam tantae
praestantiae in orb reperies, eas nedum bonas, sed tibi optabilissimas fore,
necessario confiteberis.

NOw whether the statutes of England be good or not, that only remains to
be discussed. For they proceed not only from the Princes pleasure, as do the
laws of those kingdoms that are ruled only by regal government, where
sometimes the statutes do so procure the singular commodity of the maker, that
they redound to the hinderance and damage of his subjects: Sometimes also by
the negligence and oversight of such princes, and their slight regard,
respecting only their own commodities, they are so unadvisedly made, that
they are more worthy to have the name of disorders, then of well ordered Laws:
But statutes can not thus pass in England, for so much as they are made not
only by the Princes pleasure, but also by the assent of the whole Realm: so
that of necessity they must procure the wealth of the people, and in no wise
tend to their hinderance. And it cannot otherwise be thought but that they are
replenished with much wit and wisdom, seeing they are ordained not by the
devise of one man alone or of a hundred wise Councellers only, but of more then
three hundred chosen men, much agreeing with the number of the ancient
Senators of Rome: as they that know the fashion of the Parliament of England,
and the order and manner of calling the same together, are able more distinctly
to declare. And if it fortune these Statutes being devised with such great
solemnity and wit, not to fall out so effectually, as the intent of the
makers did wish: they may be quickly reformed, but not without the assent of
the commons, and states of the Realm, by whose authority they were first
devised: Thus most worthy Prince, you do plainly understand all the kinds
of the Laws of England. And touching their qualities, as whether they be good
or no, you shall be able to mesure that, as well by your own wit, as by
comparing them with other laws: And when ye shall find non in ye whole world
of like excellency, you must of force grant them to be not only good, but also
on your behalf most to be embraced.

Here he deuiseth a mean how to know the diversity, between the Civil
Laws, and the Laws of England. Chap. 19.
ONe only doubt, wherwt your mind is troubled, remains now behind
undiscussed, And yt is this: whether as the civil laws, so likewise ye laws
of England, be fruitful and effectual, these for the Realm of England, as
the other for the Empire, and whether they may worthily be judged fit and
meet. Comparisons, most noble Prince, (as I remember I heard you once say) are
compted odious. Wherefore I am loath to meddle with them: but whether they be
both of like worthynesse, or that the one deserves an higher commendation then
the other hereof you may gather a pithier argument, out of those points,
wherein their sentences do differ, then by my declaration. For where both the
Laws do agree, the praise of them is equal. But in cases where they
disagree, the worthier Law is most praise worthy. Wherefore we will now
propound some such cases, to the intent you may indifferently ponder and weigh,
whether of these does most justly and better define the same: And first, we
will put forth examples of cases of much weight.

SOlum iam vnu^ de his, quibus agitatur animus tuus, restat explanandu^ vz. an,
vt Ciuiles, ita and Anglorum leges, frugi sint and efficaces, isti Angliae
regno, vt illae imperio, etia^ and accommodae iudicari mereantur. Comparationes
vero, Princeps, vt te aliqua^do dixisse recolo, odiosae reputantur: quo eas
agredi non delectator: tu, an ae qualis sint ambae leges meriti, vnaue altera
celsius praeconium mereatur, non ex meo iuditio, sed ex his, in quibus earum
differunt sente^tiae efficatius carpere poteris argumentum, Nam vbi conueniunt
leges ambae, aequalis laudis ipsae sunt, sed in casibus, vbi ipsae,
dissentiunt, praesta^tioris legis praeconia, digna pensatione refulgent. Quare
casus hm^di aliquos iam in medium proferemus, vt que legu^ illarum, eos iustius
meliusque definiat, aequa lance valeas po^derare and primo ex casibus maximi
ponderis, exempla proponamus.

The first case wherein the Civil Laws, and the Laws of England do differ
Chap. 20.
IF they that have a matter of controversy depending before a Judge, come to
the contestation of the suit upon the matter of the deed, which the Lawiers of
England call the issue of the plea: the truth of such an issue, by the civil
Laws, must be tried by the deposition of witnesses wherein two allowable
witnesses are sufficient. But by the Laws of England, the truth of the matter
cannot appear evident to the Judge, without the oaths of twelve men
neighbors to the place, where such a deed is supposed to be done. Now
therefore the question is, whether of these two so diverse proceedings ought to
be esteemed more reasonable and effectual for the opening of the truth, which
thus is sought for. For ye Law, that can more certainly and better show the
truth is in this behalf of more excellency, then the other that is of less
efficacy and force, wherefore in the search of this matter thus we proceed.

SI coram Iudice conte^dentes, ad litis peruenia^t contestationem super materia
facti quam Legis Angliae periti, exitum placiti appellant: Exitus huiusmodi
veritas, per Leges Ciuiles, testiu^ depositione probari debet, in qua duo
testes idonei sufficient: Sed per leges angliae veritas illa, non, nisi 12.
hominum de vicineto, vbi factu^ huiusmodi supponitur, sacrame^to, Iudici
co^stare poterit. Quaeritur igitur, quis horum duoru^ processuu^ tam
diue^soru^, rationabilior ce^seri debeat and efficatior ad veritate^, quae sic
quaeritur, reuelanda^ Quia lex, q^ea^ certius meliusque ostendere potest,
praesta^tior in hoc est lege altera quae non tantae efficatiae est and
virtutis, quare in hu ius rei indagine sic procedimus.

Here are set forth the inconveniences proceeding of that Law, which no
otherwise then by witnesses admits trials. Cha. 21.
BY the Civil Laws, the party which in the issue holds the affirmative,
must bring forth witnesses, which he himself at his own pleasure shall name.
But the negative cannot be proved directly, though indirectlie it may. For the
ability of him is thought to be very small and weak, and his wit much
less, which among all the men that he knows, is not able to find two so
void of conscience and truth, which for dread, love, or profit, will not be
ready to gainsay all truth. Such then may he produce for witnesses on his
side. And if the other party would object any thing against them, or their
sayings, it chances not ever, that they and their conditions and doings are
known to the contrary party, so that by reason of their foul lives and
vicious behavior such witnesses might be reproved. And while their sayings
contain ye affirmative, it shall be very hard to reprove the^ by
circumstances, or any other indirect means: who then shall be able to live in
surety of his goods or of himself under such a law, that ministers such aid
to every busy body ye lusts to troble another? And what 2. wicked men are so
unwary and vncircu^spect, which touching the deed, whereof, they shall be
examined in judgment, will not, before they are called forth for witnesses,
secretly imagine and devise a form and fashion thereof, and frame theru^to al
circumstances, even such, as must needs have bin so, if the thing had bin true
indeed? For the children of this world (says the Lord) are wiser then the
children of light. So the most wicked Iesabel brought forth 2. witnesses of
the children of Belial in judgment against Nabot, whereby he lost his life, and
King Achab her husband obtained ye possession of ye vinyarde. So the most
chaste matron Susanna should have died for aduoutrie by the witness of two old
dotards being judges, if the Lord had not marueilously delivered her by a
wonderful feat of prudence, which of nature the young child had not, being yet
under age. And though ye same child by their altering and doubling in their
depositions did convict the^ to be false wretches, yet who (save only the
Lord) could have known that in their sayings they would thus have disagreed?
Seeing their was no Law that did move them to have in remembrance what kind
of tree it was, whereunder the fact was supposed to be done. For the witnesses
of every wicked deed are not thought to consider al circumstances
apperteining to the same, being such as do nothing help to the aggrauation
and detection of the fault. But while those wicked Judges, willingly swearing,
did alter touching the kinds of trees, their own words proved them to be
false varlets: Wherefore they worthily suffered the same punishment themselves.
You also, most gracious Prince, do know how that lately Master John Fringe,
after that he had continued three years in the order of Priesthood, was
compelled by the deposition of two wicked persons, which witnessed that he
had, before he was made Priest, betrothed himself to a certain young woman,
to forsake the holy order of Priesthood, and to marry the same woman. With
whom when he had lived fourteen years, and had begotten seven children of
her, at the last being convicted of Treason, conspired against your Highness,
he confessed before all the people even at the very point of death, that those
witnesses were hired, and that their depositions were false. And thus many
times are judgments perverted by the mean of false witnesses, yea and that
under the very best Judges, as unto you it is not unheard, nor to the world
unknown, while this wickedness (the more is the pity) is often committed.

PEr leges Ciuiles, pars, quae in litis contestatione^ affirmatiua^dicit,

produxit, quo ipse vitam perdidit, and Achab rex, eius vinea^ possidebat. Sic

castissima Susanna, si non eam miraculose liberasset dominus inexcogitabili
prudentia, quam a natura non habuit puer junior, nondum aetate prouectus. Et si

Of the cruelty of Rackings. Chap. 22.
THerefore the law of France, in offenses criminal, whereupon death depends,
is not content to convict the party accused by witnesses least by the testimony
of false persons, innocent blood should be condemned. But that law choseth
rather to torment such offenders with racking, until they themselves confess
their own fault, rather then by the deposition of witnesses, which many times
through wicked affections, and sometimes by the subornation of evil men, are
moved to perjury. Upon this, and such like cantels and respects, offenders
and suspect persons are in that realm with so many kinds of rackings
tormented, that my pen abhors to put them in writing. For some are
stretched out upon a horse in such wise, that their sinews break and their
veins gushe out with streams of blood: Again other some have diverse great
weightes hanged at their feet, whereby their lymmes and joints are dissolved
and unloosed: Some also have their mouths so long gaged open till such
abundance of water be powered in, that their belly swells like a hill or a
tonne, to the intent that then the belly being piersed with some boring
instrument, the water may issue and spout out thereat, and at the mouth
streamwise, not much unlike a Whale, which, when he has supped up, and
swallowed down a great quantity of Sea water, with herrings and other small
fishes, gusheth out the same water again, as high as the top of any Pine
apple tree. My pen is both weary and ashamed to rehearse the outragiousnes
of torments devised in this behalf: For the number of them is so great, that
it can skant well be noted in a whole skin of parchement. Moreover the Civil
Laws, for want of witnesses, do fetch out the truth by such rackinges: And
so do diverse other Countries too. But who is so hard hearted, which being once
released out of so cruel a Rack, though he be innocent and faultlesse, would
not yet rather accuse himself of all kinds of offenses, then again to commit
himself to the intolerable cruelty of the torment once proved: and had not
rather die at once (seeing death is the end of all miseries) then so often to
be killed, and to sustain so many hellish furies, painfuller then death it
self? And did not you, most worthy Prince, know a certain offender, which in
such torments accused a worshippefull, yea a right good and faithful Knight of
Treason, wherein, as he said, they two had conspired together, which treason,
he himself being released from the rack, afterward attempted and
accomplished, thereby to acquit himself from coming to the torture again.
But at the last, by mean of those torments being so maimed in his body, that
thereby he was brought in despair of his life, and thereupon receiving his
howsell, he then swore by the same body of the Lord and by the death which he
believed that he should forthwith die, that the said knight was innocent and
guitlesse in all things whereof he had accused him, howbeit the pains,
wherein he was at the time of that his accusation, he said were so extreme,
that rather then he would feel the same again, he would not stick to accuse
the said Knight again, yea and his own Father to, This he said being then at
the very point of death, which he believed he could not then escape, no, nor
he escaped not the death which he then feared. But afterward being hanged,
at the time of his death he cleared the said Knight of all crimes whereof
before he had defamed him. Thus (O pitiful case) do many other wretches,
not for the truths sake, but forced thereunto by the extremity of torments,
And what certainetie then can arise of the confessions of miserable tormented
persons? But if some innocent body, having his mind fixed upon eternal
salvation, would in such a Babylonicall Furnace, with the three Children bless
and magnify the LORD, and not lie to the damnation of his own* soul, in that
the Judge pronounces him vnguiltie, does not that Judge by the self same
judgment judge himself guilty of all the cruelty and pains, wherewith he
has tormented the innocent? O how cruel is such a Law, which in that it can
not condemn the syely innocent, condempneth the Judge? Surely such a custom
is not to be accounted a law, but rather the high way to the Devil. O Judge,
in what School have thou learned to be present, while ye offender is
tormented. For the executio^s of judgments upon offenders ought to be done by
men of base degree: the doers whereof do purchase to themselves present infamy
by the deed doing, insomuch that ever after they are disabled from the
preferme^t of a judge: neither does ye Lord God execute his judgments,
pronounced against the dampened, by angels, but by devils. Yea and in Purgatory
ye souls there remaining, though they be predestinate to glory, yet are they
not tormented with good angels, but of evil. Those also are evil and wicked
men by whom the Lord in this world does minister to wretched sinners deserved
punishment. For, when God said in the two and twentieth Chapter of the third
book of Kings: Who shall deceive Achab? It was an evil spirit that answered: I
will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. For it becomes not a
good spirit to take upon him the execution of such things, though this
judgment proceeded from the Lord, that Achab should be deceived by a lie. But
the Judge peradventure will say: I with mine own hands did nothing in these
torments. But what differs it, whether one be a doer with his own hands, or
else be present at the doing, and the thing that is done to exasperate it vy
his commandment. It is only the Master of the ship that brings it to the
Haven, though by his commandment an other be the stirresman, I believe that
the wound wherewith the mind of the Judge thus tormenting any man is plagued,
will never be healed again, especially while he remembers the extremity of
the pains sustained by the poor wretch in those miserable torments.

NOn igitur co^tenta est lex Franciae in criminalibus, vbi mors imminet, rerum
testibus conuincere, ne falsidicoru^ testimonio sa^guis innoce^s condemnetur.
Sed ma^ult lex illa reos tales torturis cruciari, quousque ipsi eorum reatum
co^fitea^tur, qua^ testium depositione qui saepe passionibus iniquis, and
quandoque subornatione malorum, ad periuria stimulantur. Quali cautione and
astutia, criminosi etiam and de criminibus suspecti, tot torturarum in regno
illo generibus affliguntur, quod fastidit calamus ea, literis designare* Quidam
vero in equuleis extenduntur, quo eorum rumpuntur nerui, and venae in sanguinis
flue^ta prorumpu^t: Quorundam vero, diuersorum ponderum pendulis dissoluuntur
compagines and iuncturae: Et quorundam gaggantur ora, vsque dum per illa, tot
aquarum infundantur fluenta, vt ipsorum venture montis tumescat more, quo tunc
ve^ter ille, fos^orio vel simili percussus instrume^to, per os aquam illa^
euomat, ad instar Balenae, quae, cum halecibus and alijs pisciculis mare
absorbuit, aquam despumat ad altitudinem arboris Pini. Piget (proh pudor) iam
penna exquisitorum ad haec cruciatuu^ enarrare immania. Nam eorum variatus
numerus vix notari poterit magna in membrana. Leges etiam ipsae Ciuiles,
deficiente testium copia, in criminalibus, veritatem consimilibus extorquent
tormentis: Qualiter and faciunt etiam quam plurima Regna. Sed quis ^am duri
animi est, qui semel ab atroci tanto torculari laxatus, non potius innoce^s
ille, omnia fateretur scelerum genera, quam acerbitatem sic experti iterum
subire tormenti, and non semel mori mallet, dum mors sit vltimum terribilium,
quam toties occidi, and totidem gehennales furias morte amariores sustinere? Et
nonne, princeps, tu nouisti criminosum quendam qui inter tormenta huiusmodi,
militem nobilem, probum, and fidelem de proditione quadam, super qua, vt
asseruit, ipsi duo insimul coniurarunt, accusare, quoth and consta^ter postmodum
ipse fecit, a torturis illis relaxatus, ne ite rum eadem tormenta ipsa ipse
subiret. Sed demum, cu^ ex paenis illis laesus vsque ad mortis articulu^
infirmaretur, vltimu^ quoque viaticu^, christi videlice^ corpus sumpsisset:
Iurauit tunc super corpus illud, and per mortem, qua^ tunc protinus credidit se
passurum, militem illu^ innocente^ fuisse and immunemde omnibus in quibus eum
accusauit, tamen ait paenas, in quibus ipse tempore delationis suae fuerat, ita
atroces extitisse, quoth priusqua^ eas iteru^ experiretur, etia^ eu^dem milite^
ille iterum accusaret, similiter and patrem proprium, licet tunc in mortis
limine, qua^ non credidit se posse euadere, fuerit co^stitutus, necvero, ipse
mortem, qua^ tu^c metuit, euasit. Sed demum suspensus, tempore mortis suae
ipsum militem purgauit ab omni crimine, de quo dudu^ defamauit. Taliter, proh
dolor, and qua^ plures alij miseri faciunt, non veritatis causa, sed solum
vrgentibus torturis arctati, quid tunc certitudinis resultat, ex confessionibus
taliter compressorum? Caeterum si innoce^^ aliquis non immemor salutis eternae
in huiusmodi Babilonis furnace, cum tribus pueris benedicat domino, nec mentiri
velit in perniciem animae suae, quo iudex eum pro nunciat innocente^, no^ne
eode^ iudicio, Iudex ille, seipsum reum iudicat omnis saeuitiae and paenarum,
quibus innocentem afflixit? O qua^ crudelis est lex talis, quae dum innocentem
dampnare nequit, iudice^ ipsa co^demnat? Vere non lex ritus talis esse
perhibetur, sed pot^ us semita ipsa est ad gehenna^. O iudex quibus in Scholis
didicisti, te praesentem exhibere, dum paenas luit reus? Exe cutiones quippe
iudiciorum in criminosos, per ignobiles fieri conuenit: Nam earum actores,
infames solent esse ipso facto, quo and ipsi de inde ad iudicialem apicem
redduntur indigni: non enim per angelos, sed per daemones, exequi facit dominus
iudicia sua reddita in damnatos. Nec reuera in purgatorio crucia^t animas, qua^
uis praedestinatas ad gloriam angeli boni, sed mali. Maligni etia^ homines sunt
perquos dominus in hoc mundo, miseris tribuit malum paenae. Nam, cu^ dixerat
Deus iij. Regum in Capitulo vicesimo secundo: Quis decipiet mihi Ahab? malus
erat spiritus, ille, qui respondit: Ego ero spiritus me^dax in ore omnium
Prophetarum eius. Non enim decuit spiritum bonu^ exequi talia, licet a domino
prodijt iudicium, quod Achab mendacio deciperetur. Sed dicet Iudex forsan: Ego
nihil egi manibus meis in cruciatibus istis. Sed quid refert proprijs facere
manibus, an praesentem esse, and quod factum est, mandato suo iterum atque
iterum aggra^are: Solum magister nauis est qui eam ducit ad portum, licet eius
mandato alij agitent proram. Credo quod vulnus, quo sauciatur animus iudicis
paenas huiusmodi infligentis, nunquam in cica^^cem veniet, maxim dum recolit
a^erbitatem paena^u^ miseri sic afflicti.

Here he shows that the Civil Law often fails in doing of Justice. Chap. 23.
PRaeterea, si ex contractibus, illatisue iniurijs, vel haereditatis titulo,
ius accreuerit homini agendi in iudicio: si testes non fuerint, vel, si qui
fuerint, moriantur, succumbet ipse agens in causa sua, nisi ius suu^ probare
valeat ineuitabilibus coniecturis, quoth facere crebro non contingit. Quare de
domi nijs and alijs possessionibus iure civilly regulatis, similiter and in
omnibus actionibus cadentibus sub eode^ iure, actiones agentium pro defectu
testium quam pluries suffocantur, ita quod earum vix pars media optatum finem
sortiatur. Qualis tunc est lex huiusmodi, quae iniuratis, taliter deficit in
iustitia reddenda? dubito an ^usta vocari mereatur, quia in eadem lege
scribitur quod Iustitia vnicuiqu^ tribuit quod suum est, quod non faciat lex
talis.

Moreover, if by reason of bargaining, or by suffering of injuries, or by Title
of inheritance, right do accrewe to a man, to plead in Judgment: If there
be no witnesses, or if such as were witnesses be dead, the Plaintiff must
needs let his Action fall, except he be able to prove his right by
inevitable conjectures, which is seldom seen. Wherefore concerning
Lordeshippes, and other possession ruled by the Civil Law, And in all Actions
falling under the same Law, the Actions of the Plaintifes, for want of
witnesses, many times are choked, so that scante the half part of them
attaineth to the desired end. What manner of law then is this, which to them
that sustain wrong thus fails in yielding Justice? I doubt whether it
deserves to be called a just Law, because in the same Law it is written, that
Justice renders to every man that which is his own, But this cannot such a
Law do.

Here he declares, how Counties are divided, and Shirifes chosen. Chap. 24.
EXposita ia^ forma, qua leges Ciuiles de veritate facti in Iudicio deducti

His iam sic praesuppositis, ad eorum, quae quaerimus, indaginem procedamus.

NOw that we have opened, after what manner the Civil Laws do inform a Judge
of the truth of a matter brought into judgment, it is conseque^t to declare
by what means the laws of England do boult out the truth of such a matter.
For the orders of both the Laws being laid together, the qualities of them
both will more plainly appear: for so much as the Philosopher says, that
contraries, placed one by an other, will show themselves more evidently. But
herein, after the manner of Orators, in stead of a Proheme, it shall not be
amiss, that we open certain things before, the knowledge whereof will give
light to things which hereafter shall come in talk, wherefore thus we do
proceed. The Realm of England is divided into Counties, as the Realm of
France, is into Baylywickes, so that in England there is no place that is not
within the body of some County. Counties also are divided into Hundreds,
which somewhere are called Wapentages. And Hundreds are divided into Villages,
under which appellation are contained Borowes, and Cities. For the bounds of
Uillages are not contained within the circuit of Walls, Buildinges, or
Streets, but within the compass of Fields, great Territories, certain
Hamlettes, and many other, as of Waters, Woods and waste Grounds, which it is
not needful now to set forth by their names: because that in England there
is skant any place, which is not contained within the compass of Uillages,
though certain Privileged places within villages, are supposed to be no
parcel of the same Uillages. Moreover in every County there is one certain
officer called the Kings Sheriff, which among other duties belonging to his
Office, puts in execution all the commandments and judgments of the kings
courts, that are to be executed within his counties: His office endures but
for one year, so that after the expiration of the year, he may not minister
in that Office, Neither shall he, within two years next ensuing, be admitted
to the same Office again. This officer is thus chosen. Every year, the
morrow after All souls day, all the Kings Counselors meet together in the
Kings Exchequer, as well the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, as all other
Justices, all the Barons of the Exchequer, the Master of the Rolls, and
certain other Officers, where all these with one common assent do name of
every County three Knights or Esquires, whom among other of the same County
they take to be of good disposition and fame, and best disposed to the Office
of Sheriff of that County: Of the which three the King chooses one, whom,
by his letters patents, he appoints Shyrife of the County, that he is
chosen of, for the year then following: But he, before he receive his patent,
shall swear upon the holy Gospel, among other articles, that he shall well
and faithfully and indifferently exercise and do his office all that year,
and that he shall receive or take nothing of any other man then the King, by
color or mean of his office.

These things being thus now presupposed, let us proceed to the search of
those things that we seek for.

How Jurors must be chosen and sworn. Chapter 25.

AS often as suitors in the courts of the King of England, are come to the issue
of their plea upon the matter of the fact, forthwith the Justices by virtue of
the Kings writ, do writ unto the Shirife of the County, wherein the deed is
supposed to be done, that he do cause to come before the same Justices at a
certain day by them limited, xij. good and lawful men, neighbors to the
place where the fact is supposed to be done: the same to be such as be of no
kin to either of the pleaders, to the end that by their oaths it may
certainly be known, whether the deed were done as the one party affirms,
or else as the other party denies. Upon the day aforesaid, the Shirife shall
return the said Writ before the same Justices, together with the pannell of
their names, which he heereunto has summoned: When they are come, either
party may refuse them, alleging that the Shirife has made that pannell
favorably for the other party, of persons not indifferent: Which exception,
if it be found true by the oath of two men of the same pannell chosen
thereunto by the Justices, that pannell shall immediately be quassed: and then
the Justices shall write to the Coroners of the same county, that they shall
make a new pannell. Which when they have done, if it be likewise found
faulty, it shall also be quassed: And then the Justices shall elect and choose
two of the Clerks of the same court, or other of the same County, which in
the presence of the court upon their oaths shall make an indifferent pannell,
which by neither of the parties shall be challenged: Howbeit, when the men so
impannelled are come into the court, either of the parties may make exceptions
against the parson of any of them, as he may also do in all cases and at all
times, when any man by any means impanelled that appear to be sworn in ye
court upon the truth of such an issue: saying, that the person impanelled is
cousin or alied to the other party, or by any kind of amity so knit unto him
that he is not indifferent to declare the truth between the^: and of these
exceptions there are so many kinds and sorts, that they cannot be in few words
rehearsed. Whereof if any one be found true, the^ shall not he be sworn,
against whom the exception is proposed, but his name shall be cancelled in the
panel. So also shall be done of all ye names of ye persons impanelled until
xii. of them so indifferent be sworn, that neither party can have against the^
any matter of exception or challe^ge: Also of these xii.iiii. at ye least
shall be of the hundred, where the village stands, wherein ye fact whereupon the
suit rises, is supposed to be done: And every such Iurer shall have lands or
revenues for term of life, at the least, to the yearly value of xl.s. And this
order is observed and kept in all actons and causes criminal, real, and
personal, saving where the damages or debt in actions personal exceeds not
the sum of xl. marks of English money: For then it is not requisite, that
Iurers in such actions, shall be able to dispende so much. Yet they shall have
land or rents to a co^petent value after ye discretion of the Justices,
Otherwise they shall not be sworn, lest for need and poverty, such Iurers
might easily be corrupt and suborned. And if by such exceptions so many Iurers
names be cancelled in the pannell, that their remains not a sufficient
number to make thereof a Jury, then the Shirife by the Kings Writ shall be
commanded to adioyne more Iurers, which thing man often be done, so that for
lack of Jurors, the inquisition of the truth upon such a plea shall not remain.
And this is ye form, how iurers, and inquisitors of truth ought to be chosen
in ye kings court, and likewise to be sworn: Wherefore, how they most be
charged and in formed of ye uttering of ye same truth, this now rests to be
discussed.

How Iurers ought to be informed by evidences and witnesses. Chap. 26.

Twelve good and lawful men being at ye last sworn in form aforsaid having
beside their mouables, sufficient possessions as before is declared whereby they
may be able to maintain their own states, and being to neither par^y suspect
or hated, but neighbors to the^ both, the^ shall be red before them in English
by ye court, all the record and process of the plea depending between ye
parties, with a plain declaration of the issue of the plea, touching the
truth whereof those sworn men shall certify the Court: which things being
done, either party by himself or his Counselors, in ye presence of the Court,
shall utter and open to the said sworn men, al and singular matters and
Evidences, whereby he thinks he may best inform them of the truth of ye
issue so impleaded. And then may either party bring before ye same Justices and
sworn men, al and singular such witnesses on his behalf, as he will produce,
Who by the Justices being charged upon the holy Gospel of God, shall testify
all things proouing the truth of the fact, whereupon the parties contend. And
if need so require, those witnesses shall be severed and divided, till they
have deposed all that they will, so that the saying of one shall not move or
provoke another to testify the like. The premises being done, then after that
those Jurors have had talk at their pleasure, upon the truth of that issue,
with as much deliberation as themselves shall require, in the keeping of the
ministers of the Court, within a place to them for the same purpose assigned,
to the intent that no man in the mean time may corrupt them, they shall
return into the Court, and certefie the Justices upon the verity of the issue
so joined, in the presence of both the parties, (if they will be there) and
specially of the plaintiff. The report of which Iurers, by the laws of
England, is called a verdict, by the which word is meant, a true report, or a
report of the truth: And then according to the quality of that verdict the
Justices shall frame and form their judgment. Notwithstanding, if the other
party, against who^ the verdict is given, complain, that he is thereby
unjustly grieved, then the same party may sue a writ of attainte against those
Jurors, and against the party that has prevailed By force of which Writ, if it
shall be found by the oath of twenty and four men, in form aforesaid
returned, elect, and sworn, which shall be men of much greater livings, then
the first Iurers were, that the same first Iurers have made a false oa^he, then
the bodies of the same first Iurers shall be committed to the Kings Prison,
their goods shall be confiscate, and all their possessions shall be seized
into the Kings hands, their Houses also and Buildings shall be rased and
thrown down, their Woods felled, and their Meadowe grounds plowed, And also
the same first Iurers shall for ever after be noted for infamed persons, and
shall in no place be received to testify the truth: And the party, which in
the former plea had the overthrow, shall be restored to all things, which by
occasion thereof he has lost. Who then, though be regard not his souls
health, yet for fear of so great punishment, and for shame of so great
infamy, would not upon his oath declare ye truth? And if one man peradventure
have so little respect to his honor or estimation, yet some of so many
Iuroures will not neglect their own good fame, nor will not thorough their
own default, suffer themselves thus to be spoiled of their goods and
possessions. Is not this order now for the boulting out of the truth better
and more effectual, then the process which the Civil laws do procure? Here
no cause, for no man's right quaileth through death or for want of witness,
Here are not brought forth unknown witnesses, hired persons, poor men,
vagabonds unconstant people, or such, whose condition and naughtiness is
unknown. These witnesses are neighbors able to live of their own, of good
name and fame, of honest report, not brought into the Court by the party, but
by a worshipful and indifferent Officer chosen, and so compelled to come
before the Judge. These know all, that the witnesses are able to depose, and
they know also the constancy and inconstancy of the witnesses, and what
report goes upon them. And what will ye have more. Doubtless, there is
nothing, that may disclose the truth of any doubt falling in contention, which
can in any wise be hid from such Iurers, so that it be possible for the
same to come to man's knowledge.

Here he shows, how causes criminal, are determined in England. Chap. 27.
SEd quomodo in criminalibus leges Angliaescruta^tur veritatem etia^ rima re
pernecessariu^est, ve and in eis plenarie agnita ambaru^ legu^ forma, quae
earu^ efficacius latentem reuelat veritate^ certius agnoscamus. Si reus
quispiam de felonia aut proditione in Anglia rettatus, crimen suum coram
iudicibus dedicat, mox vicecomes comitatus, vbi facinus illud co^missum est,
venire faciet coram eisdem iudicibus, viginti quatuor probos and legales
homines de vicineto villae, vbi illud factu^ est, qui rettatu^ illu^ nulla
affinitate attingunt, and quoru^ quilibet C.s. habeat terrae and redditus ad
certifica^dum Iudic' illos super criminis il lius veritate. Quibus
co^pare^tibus, rettatus ille eos calumpniare potest, eade^ forma, qua in
actionibus realibus fieri debere superius describitur. Et insuper reus ipse in
fauore^ vitae suae calu^pni are potest 35. ho^ines, quos ipse maxim for midat,
qui ad eius calumpnia^ cancellabunt^ in panello aut signis talibus notabu^ tur,
quod (vt verbis legis vtar) illi super eum no^ transibunt, licet ipse nulla^
causa^ assignare sciat exceptionis seu calumpniae suae. Quis tunc mori posset
inique in Anglia pro crimine, cum tot iuuamina habere ille poterit ob fauorem
vitae suae, and non nisi vicini eius, probi and fideles homines, versus quos
ipse nullam habet materia^ excaeptionis, eum condemnare poterunt? Mallem reuera
viginti facinorosos mortem pietate euadere, quam iustum vnum unjust
condemnari. Nec tamen reum que^piam sub hac forma, reatus sui paena^ euadere
posse suspicandum est, dum eius vita et mo res timori deinceps erunt eis, qui
eu^ sic purgaru^t a crimine. In hoc equide^ processu, nihil est crudele, nihil
inhumanum, nec laedi poterit innocens in corpore aut membris suis: Quare nec
formidabit ille calu^pnia^ inimicorum eius, quia non torquebitur iste ad
arbitriu^ ipsoru^. Sub hac igitur lege viuere quietu et securu^ est. Iudica
ergo, Princeps optime, quae legu^ haru^ tibi electissima foret, si tu priuata^
spirares vitam.

BUt it is also necessarrie to discuss, how in matters criminal, the laws of
England do fetch out the truth, that perfectly understanding the form of both
the Laws, we may the more certainly perceive and know, whether of them both
does more effectually discover the hidden truth. If any man accused of felony
or treason in England, do at his arraignement before the same Judges deny
the offense, forthwith the Sheriff of the County, where the deed was done
shall cause to come before the same Judges four and twenty good and lawful
men dwelling nighe to the village, where the fact was done, such men as to the
party accused be nothing allied: and such as every of them has an hundredth
shill^nges of Lands and Revenues, to certify the Judges upon the truth of
the crime. Which at their appearance the party accused may challenge, in like
sort as in actions real may be done, as before is described. And moreover the
same party in favor of his life may challenge five and thirty men such as
he most fears: which upon his challenge shall be cancelled in the pannell:
or shall be noted with such marks, that they shall not pass upon him:
though he be not able to show any cause of his exception and challenge. Who
then can unjustly die in England for any criminal offense, seeing he may have
so many helps for the favor of his life, and that none may condemn him but
his neighbors, good and lawful men, against whom he has no matter of
exception. Indeed I would rather wish twenty evil doers to escape death
through pity, then one man to be unjustly condemned. And yet it is not to
be suspected, that any offendour can under this form, escape the punishment
of his offense, forasmuch as his life and conversation shall be afterward a
terror to them that have thus cleared him of the crime. In this kind of
proceeding there is no cruelty or extremity used, Neither can the innocent and
unguilty person be hurt in his body or limbs: Wherefore he shall not stand
in fear of the slander of his enemies, because he shall not be racked or
tormented at their will and pleasure. Thus under this Law a man may pass his
life with quietness and safety. Judge you therefore, most noble Prince,
whether of these laws ye had rather choose, if you should live a private life.

The Prince grants the Laws of England to be more commodious for the
subjects, then the Civil Laws in the case now disputed. Chap. 28.
CVi Princeps, arduu ambiguumue, Cancellarie, non conspicio, quoth morosum me
titubantemue redderet in electione rei, qua^ interrogas. Nam quis non sub lege,
qua secu^am ducere posset vitam, viuere po^^u^ eligeret qua^ sub legetali, sub

Vere tutus quisqua^ esse non poterit in corpore aut in bonis, quem ^imicus eius
(in omni causa) conuincere poterit, testibus d^obus etia^ ignotis, per^p^mmet
electis and productis. Et licet quis morte^, per dicta eorum, subire no^
cogatur, parum tame^ releuatur ipse qui mortem euasit, contractione neruorum,

qua^ tu iam dudum explicasti. Sed tale ma^u^ operari nequiu^t testes, qui

testium mores, maxim si vicini ipsi fuerint, noscunt etiam, and si ipsi sint
ctedulitate digni. Omnes etiam duodecim tales latere omnino non poterit,
quicquid actum est, per, aut inter vicinos eorum. Nosco namque ego certius,
quae iam aguntur hic in Barro, vbi sum modo conuersatus, quam quae in Anglia
fiunt. Nec effugere posse puto notitiam probi viri ea, quae aguntur, licet
quodammodo occulte, prope domicilium eius. Sed tamen cur praedicta lex Angliae
quae tam frugi and optabilis est non est toti mundo communis, vehementer
admiror.

WHereunto the Prince answered and said: I see no hard or strange matter, good
Chancellor, that should make me doubtful or dangerous in the election and
choice of the thing that ye ask. For who would not rather choose to live
under that Law, wherevnder he might live in security, then under that Law,
which would set him naked and succourlesse against the cruelty of his enemies?
Uerely, no man can be safe in body or goods, whom his adversary may convince
in every cause, with two unknown witnesses of his own choosing and bringing
forth. And though a man be not compelled by their sayings to die, yet is he
little relieved, y^ has escaped death, being shronke in all his sinnewes and
lim^nes and cast into a perpetual impotencie of his body, And truly into
such danger may the craft of a spiteful person bring any manne, that lives
under the Law, which here while you speak of. But such mischief and
inconvenience cannot be wrought vy witnesses, yt make their depositions in the
presence of twelve credible men, neighbors to the deed, that is presently in
question, and to the circumstances of the same: which also know the manners and
conditions of the same witnesses, especially if they be nigh dwellers, and
know also, whether they be men worthy to be credited or no. And further all
those twelve can not be ignorant in those things, that were done by and among
their neighbors. For I know more certainly the things that are done here
in Berry, where I am now remaining, then those things that are done in
England. Neither do I think, that things can be kept from the knowledge of
a good and honest man, being done nigh to his house and almost under his nose,
be they never so secretly done. But yet I marvel much, why the foresaid law of
England, which is so good and commodious, is not common to all the whole world.

Why inquestes are not made by Iurers of xij. men in other Realms, as well as
in England. Chap. 29.
YOur highness came very young out of England (quod the Chancellor) so that
the disposition and quality of that land is unknown unto you. Which if ye
know, and should compare therewith the commodities and qualities of other
Countries, you would nothing marvel at these things, which now do trouble
your mind. Indeed England is so fertile and fruitful, that comparing
quantity to quantity, it surmounteth all other lands in fruitefulnesse, Yea it
brings forth fruit of it self, scant provoked by manns industry and
labor. For there the Lands, the Fields, the Groves, and the Woods, do so
aboundantlye spring, that the same untilled do commonly yield to their owners
more profit then tilled, though else they be most fruitful of Corn and
Grain. There also are Fields of pasture enclosed with Hedges and Ditches,
with Trees planted and growing upon the same, which are a defense to their
heardes of Sheep, and Cattle, against storms and heat of the Sun, And the
pastures are commonly watered, so that Cattle shut and closed therein, have
no need of keeping, neither by day, nor by night. For there be no Woolues,
nor Bears, nor Lions, Wherefore their Sheep lie night by night in the Fields
unkept within their Foldes wherewith their Land is manured. By the means
whereof, the men of that Country are ^cant troubled with any painful labor,
Wherefore they live more spiritually, as did the aun^ient Fathers, which did
^ather choose to keep and feed Cattle, then ^o disturb the quietness of
the mind with care of Husbandry.

And hereof it comes, that men of this Country are more apt and fit to
discern in doubtful causes of great examination and trial, then are men
whollye given to moyling in the ground: in whom that rural exercise
ingendereth rudeness of wit and mind. Moreover the same Country is so
filled and replenished with Landed men, that therein so small a thorpe cannot
be found, wherein dwells not a Knight, an Esquire, or such a Householder, as
is there commonly called a franklayne, enryched with great possessions. And
also other Freeholders, and many Yeomen able for their liueloodes to make a
Iurye in form before mentioned. For there be in that Land diverse Yeomen,
which are able to dispende by the year above a hundred pounds, Wherefore the
Iuries before declared, are there very often made, specially in great matters, of
Knights, Esquires, and others, whose possessions in the whole amounts yearly
above the sum of five hundred marks.

Wherefore it cannot be thought, that such men can be suborned, or that
they will be perjured, not only for that they have before their eyes the
fear of God, but also, for that they have a careful regard to the
preservation of their Honors, and to the eschewing of reproach, and damage
thereupon ensuing, and also that their heiers be not impeached thorough their
infamy. After this manner, O mighty Prince, are none other Realms of the
world disposed and inhabited.

For though there be in them men of great power, of great riches, and
possessions, yet they dwell not one nigh to another, as such great men do in
England, Neither so many inheritours and possessours of Land are elsewhere, as
in England.

For in a whole town of any other Country, it is hard to find one man,
which for his liueloode is able to be received into a Jury. For there,
except it be in Cities, and walled Towns, very few there be, beside Noble
men, that have any possessions of Lands or other immoueables. The Noble men
also have there small store of pasture, And to labor in vineyards, or to put
their hands to the plough, that is unfit for their estate and degree, And
yet in Uineyardes, and eareable ground, consists the Substance of their
possessions, saving only a few fields next adjoining to great rivers, and
saving also certain Woods. the pastures whereof are common to their tenants
and neighbors. How then can a Iurye be made in such Countries of twelve
substantial men, nigh adjoining to the place of any deed brought in
judgment, seeing they cannot be called neighbors that dwell so far a
sunder. Truly twelve sworn men, there, must needs be far distant from the
place of the deed, when the defendant in those Countries has challenged
thirty five men of the next dwellers, without showing any cause why:
Wherefore, in those lands a Jury must be made, either of such, as dwell
far off from the place of the deed that is in controversy, and therefore
cannot attain to the knowledge of the truth thereof, or else it must be made
of poor men, that be not ashamed of infamy, neither do fear the loss of
their goods, which they have not, They also blinded wi^h rusticall and brute
rudeness, are not able to behold the clear brightness of the truth.

Marueyle not therefore most worthy Prince, if the Law, whereby the truth is
sifted out in England, be not frequented and used in other nations, For they
are not hable to make sufficient and like Iuries, as be made in England.

CAncellarius, Iuuenis recessisti ( Princeps) ab Anglia, quo tibi ignota est
dispositio, and qualitas terrae illius, quas si agnoueris, and caeterarum
regionum emolumenta qualitatesque eisdem comparaueris, non admirareris ea,
quibus iam agitatur animus tuus Anglia sane tam fertilis est, quod quantitate
ad qua^titatem comparata, ipsa caeteras omnes quasi regiones exsuperat vbertate
fructuum, etiam suum vltro ipsa profert, vix industria bominis concitata. Na^
agri e^us, campi, saltus, and nemora, tanta fecunditate germina ebulliunt, vt
inculta illa, saepe plus commodi afferant possessoribus suis, quam arata, licet
fertilissima ipsa sint segitum, and bladorum. Includuntur quoque in terra illa
pasturarum arua, fossatis, and sepibus, desuper arboribus plantatis, quibus
muniuntur a procellis and aestu solis, eorum greges and armenta, ipsae que
pasturae vt plurimum irriguae sunt quo infra earu^ claustra reclusa animalia,
custodia non egent, per diem, nec per noctem. Nam ibi lupi no^ sunt, vrsi, nec
Leones, quare de nocte oues eoru^ incustoditae in campis recumbunt, in caulis,
and ouilibus, quibus impinguantur terrae eorum. Vnde homines patriae illius,
vix operis sudore graua^tur, quare spiritu ipsi magis viuunt, vt fecerunt
patres antiqui, qui pascere maleba^t greges quam animi quiete^ agriculturae
solicitudine turbare.

Ex quibus, homines regionis istius, apti magis redduntur and dispositi ad
discernendum in causis, quae magni sunt examinis, quam sunt viri, qui telluris
operibus inhabitants, ex ruris familiaritate mentis contrahu^t ruditatem.
Regio etia^ illa, ita respersa, refertaque est possessoribus terrarum and
agrorum, quod in ea, villola ta^ parua reperiri non poterit, in qua non est
miles, armiger, vel paterfai^lias, qualis ibide^ Franklain vul
gariternuncupatur, magnis ditatus possessionibus, necnon libere tenentes alij,
and Valecti plurimi^, suis patrimonijs susficientes, ad faciendum iurata^ in
forma praenotata. Sunt namque valecti diuersi in regione illa, qui plusquam
sexcenta scuta per annum expendere possunt, quo iuratae superius descriptae,
saepissime in regione illa fiunt, praesertim in ingentibus causis, de
militibus, armigeris, and alijs, quorum possessiones in vniuerso excedunt duo
millia scutorum per annu^. Quare cogitari nequit, tales subornari posse, vel
periurari^ velle, nedum ob timore^ Dei, sed and ob honore^ suum conseruandu^,
and vituperium, dampnum quoque inde consequu^iuu^ euitandum, etiam, ne eorum
haeredes ipsorum laedantur infamia. Taliter, fili regis, disposita, inhab^tata
que non sunt aliqua alia mundi regna.

Nam licet in eis sint viri magnae potentiae, magnarum opum and possessionum,
non tamen eorum vnus prope moratur ad alterum, vt in Anglia tanti morantur
viri, nec tanta, vt ibi, haereditatorum est copia and possidentium terras.

Vix enim in villata vna regionum aliaru^ reperiri poterit vir vnus patrimonio
sufficiens, vt in iuratis ipse ponatur. Nam raro ibidem, aliqui praeter nobiles
reperiunt^r, possessores agroru^, aliorumue immobilium, extra civitates and
muratas villas. Nobiles quoque ibidem, pasturarum copiam non habe^t, and vineas
colere, aut aratro manus apponere statui eorum non conuenit, tamen in vineis
and terris arabilibus co^sistit substa^tia possessionu^ eorum, exceptis solum
pratis quibusda^, adiace^tibus magnis riparijs and exceptis boscis, quorum
pasturae co^munes sunt tene^tibus, and vicinis suis. Quomodo tunc in regionibus
talibus iurata fieri poterit, ex duodecim probis hominibus de vicineto, vbi
factu^ aliquod in iudicio deducitur, cum vicini dici non poterunt, qui tanta
distantia distinguuntur? Vere remotos multum a facto duodecim iuratos ibidem
esse opportebit, postquam reus in regionibus illis, triginta quinque (sine
assignata causa) de propinqu^ioribus calumniauerit: quare aut de multum remotis
a facto, de quo contenditur, qui veritatem facti non agnoscunt, in regnis illis
oportebit facere iuratam, aut de pauperibus, quibus non est verecundia
infamiae, nec timor iacturae bonorum suorum, cum ipsa non sint, ipsi etiam
rusticitatis ruditate obcecati, veritatis claritatem nequeunt intueri.

Non igitur mireris, Princeps, si Lex, qua in Anglia veritas inquiritur, alias
non peruagetur nationes, ip sae namque, vt Anglia, facere nequeunt sufficientes
co^similesque iuratas.

Here the Prince commends, the Laws of England, of their proceeding by
Iuries. Chap. 30.
TVnc Princeps, Comparationes odiosas esse licet dixerimus, lex tamen Ciuilis,
in comparatione per te facta, omni se purgabit a crimine: quia, licet ei Legem
Angliae tu praetulcris, odium inde ipsa non meretur, dum neque eam, neque
co^ditores eius increpasti: sed solum patriam, vbi illa regit, causam esse
demonstrasti, quod non tam optabili processu, vt lex Angliae, ipsa in dubijs
elicit veritate^. Legem vero Angliae, in casu iam per te disputato,
acco^modatiorem esse regno illi, quam est lex Ciuilis, ambigere non sinimur,
quo, eam pro Civilly commutare non appetimus: Sed tamen haec Leges Angliae
praeeminentia, ab alterius crimine non euenit, solum enim eam, Angliae
fertilitas sic causauit.

THough we have said, (quod the Prince) that compa^isons are odious, ^et the
Civil Law in the comparison by you made, has cleared it self from all
blame: For, though you have proved the Law of England to be of more
excellency then it, yet it deserves not thereby to be odious, for so much as
you have blamed neither it, nor the makers thereof: But have showed the
country, where it rules to be the only cause, why it does not, in matters of
doubt try out the truth with so commendable a kind of proceeding, as the
Law of England does. But as touching that the Law of England, in the case by
you now discussed, is more fit and meet for that realm, then the Civil law,
hereof we may not doubt: Wherefore, we are not desirous to change it for the
Civil law: Howbeit this preeminence of the Law of England, proceeds not of
the fault of the other, for it is only the fertility of England, that has
caused it to be such as it is.

The Prince doubts, whether this proceeding by a Jury, be repugnant to Gods
law, or not. Chap. 31.
SEd, licet non infime, Cancellarie, nos delectet forma, qua leges Angiae in
contentionibus reuelant veritatem, tamen, an modus ille sacrae repugnet
scripturae, vel non, paululum agitamur: Ait namque Dominus Phariseis, Iohan^
viij. In lege vestra scriptum est, quia duorum hominum testimonium verum est,
and huic applaudens Dominus inquit: Ego sum, qui testimonium perhibeo de me
ipso, and testimoniu^ perhibet de me, qui misit me, pater. Pharisaei quippe
Iudaei erant vnde idem erat dicere, in lege vestra scriptu^ est, and in lege
Moysaica (quae a Domino, per Moysen filijs Israel, prolata fuit) scriptum est.
Quare huic legi co^traire, legi est diuinae refragari, quo sequitur, quoth lex
Angliae, si ab hac lege discedat, a lege diuina, cui reluctari non licet, ipsa
discedit. Scribitur etiam Matthew. xviij. Quod dominus (loquens de correctione
fraterna) inter alia sic ait: Si autem non te audierit frater tuus, adhibe
tecum adhuc vnum aut duos, vt in ore duorum vel trium, stet omne verbum. Si in
ore duorum vel trium, Dominus omne verbum statuerit, frustra plurium hominu^
quaeritur in dubijs veredictum. Nemo enim potest, melius, aut aliud fundamentum
ponere, quam posuit dominus.

Haec sunt, Cancellarie, quae me, de legis Angliae processu in probationibus,
aliquantulum conturbant. Quare, quid his responde^dum est a te, doceri deposco.

BUt, though we be greatly delited in the form, which the Laws of England
use in sifting out the truth in matters of contention, yet whether the same
law be contrary to holy Scripture or not, that is to us somewhat doubtful:
For our LORD says to the Phariseis, in the eight chapter of Saint John's
Gospel: In your Law it is written, that the testimony of two men is true:
And the LORD confirming the same says: I am one that bear witness of my
self, and the Father that sent me, bears witness of me. Now Sir, the
Pharasies were Jews, so that it was all one to say: It is written in your
Law, and it is written in Moses Law, which God gave to the childen of
Israel by Moses. Wherefore to gaynesay this Law, is to deny Gods Law:
Whereby it follows, that if the Law of England swerve from this Law, it
swarueth also from Gods Law, which in no wise may be contraried. It is
written also in the eighteenth Chapter of Saint Mathewes gospel, Where the
Lord, speaking of brotherly admonition, among other things says thus: But if
thy brother hear thee not, then take yet with thee one or two, that, in the
mouth of two or three witnesses, every matter may be established. If the Lord
have appointed every matter to be established in the mouth of twoe or three
witnesses, then it is in vain for to seek for the verdict of many men in
matters of doubt. For no man is able to lay any other or better foundation then
the Lord has laid

These are the doubts, good Chancellor, which, touching the pooceeding of
the law of England in the trial of matters do somewhat trouble me.
Wherefore, what answer may hereunto be made, I would gladly learn of you.

Here is showed, that the proceeding by a Jury, is not repugnant to the Law of
God. Chap. 32.
THe Laws of England quod the Chancellor, are nothing at all repugnant to
these things y^ trouble you, most worthy Prince, though they in matters of
doubt do somewhat otherwise boult out the truth. The law of the general
Council, wherein it is provided that Cardinals shall not be convicted of
criminal offenses, otherwise then by the depositio^ of twelve witnesses, is it
any hinderance to the testimony of two men? If the testimony of two men be
true, of more force must the testimony of twelve men be judged true,
according to a rule of the Law that says: The more, ever contains in it,
that which is less. The Inholder was promised to be rewarded with an
ouer-plus, if he bestowed upon the cure of the wounded man, more then the two
pence, which he received. A man that labors to prove, that he was absent
at the time of the offense, wherewith he is charged, shall i^ not be
needful for him to bring forth more then two or three witnesses, when his
adversary has proved, or is ready to prove the same, by two or three
witnesses? And so he, that trauelleth to convince witnesses of perjury, must
of necessity bring forth many more then they were, so that the testimony of
two or three men shall not ever be judged true: But that Law must thus be
understood, that by a lesser number of witnesses then two, the truth, in
matters doubtful, ought not to be searched for, as appears by Bernarde
assygning diverse cases, wherein by the Laws more then three witnesses must
needs be produced: As in some of them five, and in and in some seven. Nor yet
the Laws of England be not against it, but that the truth may be proved by
two witnesses, when it cannot otherwise be tried. For if things be done
upon the Sea without the body of any County of that Realm, which afterward
be brought in plea before the Lord Admiral, the same things by the decrees of
the laws of England must be proved by witnesses. In like manner it has bin
accustomed to be done before the Constable and Marshall of England, touching
a fact that was done in an other Royalme, so that the heareing thereof
appertains to the Constables court. Moreover, in the Courts of certain
Liberties in England, where matters proceed by Law Merchant, contractes or
bargains, made among Merchaunts in another Realm, are proved by witnesses.
And this comes to pass, because that in these cases there be no neighbors
found, by whose oaths, Iuries of twelve men may be made, as in contractes,
and other cases, arising within the Realm of England is accustomed to be
done. Likewise if a deed, wherein witnesses are named, be brought into the
Kings Court, then process shall ^ee made against those witnesses: and they
together with twelve Iurers shall by their oaths recognize, whether the same
be his deed or no, whose it is supposed to be. Wherefore the Law of
England reprooueth not the Law, which by witnesses tries out the truth,
specially when necessity so requires: For so do the Laws of England too,
not only in the cases now mentioned, but also in certiane other cases, whereof
here to make rehersall it shall not be material. Howbeit this Law never
determines a controversy by witnesses only, that may be determined by a Jury
of xii men: for so much as this way is much more available and effectual for
the trial of the truth then is the form of any other Laws of the world, and
further from the danger of corruption and subornation. Nor this form of
proceeding, cannot in any cause fail for want of witnesses, nor the
testimonies of witnesses (if any be) cannot chose but come to their due end
and effect: Neither can such twelve men be forsworn, but that for their
offense they must suffer most sharp punishment, and nevertheless the party,
by their depositions grieved, shall obtain due remedy: And these things shall
not be done by the will and sayings of strange or unknown men, but by the
oaths of good, of worshipful, and of credible men, neighbors to the parties,
in whom the same parties have no cause of challenge or mistrust, touching their
verdict. O how horrible and detestable dangers happen many times through the
form of proceeding by witnesses! If a man make a privy contracte of
matrimony, and afterward before witnesses, do betroth or assure him self to
another woman, shall he not in the contentious court be compelled to marry
her, and also after that in the Penitenciall court, be judged to lie with the
first, if he be duly required, and to do penance, as often as by his own
motion and procurement he lies with the second, though in both Courts the
Judge be one and the self same man. In this case, as it is written in Job, are
not the sinews of Leuiathan perplexed and intricate? Fie for shame they are
intricate in deed: For, this man can carnally company with neither of these
two women, nor with any other, without punishment either by the contentious
Court, or by the Penitential Court, Such a myschiefe, inconvenience, or
danger, can never happen in any case by the way of proceeding by the Law of
England, no not though Leuiathan himself would labor to procure the same. Do
ye not now see, most noble Prince, that the more you object against the Laws
of England, the more worthy they appear?

CAncellarius. No^ his, quibus turbaris, Princeps, co^traria^tur leges Angliae,
licet aliter quodammodo ipsae in dubijs eliciant veritate^. Quid duorum hominum

minore testiu^ numero quamij. veritas in dubijs non debet exquiri, vt pa tet
per Bernardum extra* de testi. ca. licet in glossa ordinaria, vbi ipso assignat
diuersos casus, in quibus per leges, plures quam tres oportet producere,
testes: Vz. in aliquibus eorum v. and in aliquibus septe^: per duos etia^
testes veritate^ probari posse, cu^ non aliter ipsa pateret, vtique leges
Angliae affirmant. Nam si quae supra altum mare extra corpus cuiuslibet
comitatus regni illius fiant, quae postmodu^ in placito cora^ Admirallo Angliae
deducantur, per testes illa iuxta legu^ Angliae sanctiones probari debent.
Consimiliter quoque cora^ co^stabulario et mariscallo Angliae fieri solitu^ est

Co^stabularij, cognitio eius pertineat. Etiam and in curijs quarunda^
libertatum in Anglia, vbi per legem Mercatoria^ proceditur, probant per testes,
contractus inter mercatores extra regnum factos. Quia in casibus his non
reperiuntur vicini, per quorum sacramenta, iuratae ex duodecim hominibus fieri
possunt, prout de contractibus and alijs casibus, infra regnum Angliae
emergentibus, est fieri consuetum. Similiter, si carta, in qua testes
nominantur, deducatur in curia Regis, processus tunc fiet erga testes illos,
ipsi quoque recognosce^t simul cu^ xij. iuratoribus per eoru^ sacrame^ta vtru^
carta illa sit factum eius, cuius supponitur, an non. Quare, lege^, qua
testibus veritas extorquetur, lex Angliae no^ conde^nat, maxim cum necessitas

decidi poterit, cum sit modus iste ad veritatem elicienda^ multo potior and
efficatior, quam est forma aliquaru^ aliarum legum orbis, and remotior a
corruptionis and subornationis periculo. Nec potest haec procedendi forma in

Angliae tanto magis clarescere, quanto ^isdem tu amplius reluctaris?

Wherefore, certain Kings of England, have had no delight in their own Laws.
Chap. 33.
PRinceps, video, inquit, and eas inter totius orbis iura (in casu, quo tu iam
sudasti) praefulgere considero, tamen progenitorum meorum Angliae regum quosdam
audiuimus, in legibus suis minime delectatos, satagentes proinde, leges ciuiles
ad Angliae regime^ inducere, and patrias leges repudiare fuisse conatos: horum
reuera consilium veheme^ter admiror.

I See plainly, quod the Prince, that in the case, wherein you have now
travailed, they have the preeminence above all other Laws of the world, yet
we have heard, that some of my progenitors, Kings of England, have not bin
pleased with their own Laws, and have therefore gone about to bring in the
Civil laws to the government of England, and to abolishe their own Country
Laws. For what purpose and intent they so did, I much marvel.

Here the Chancellor opens the cause, which the Prince demands Chap. 34.
YOu would nothing marvel heereat, quod the Chancellor, if you did deeply
consider with your self, the cause of this intent. For you have heard before,
how that, among the Civil Laws, that maxim or rule is a sentence most
notable, which thus sings: The Princes pleasure stands in force of a Law:
quite contrary to the decrees of the Laws of England, whereby the King
thereof rules his people, not only by Regal, but also by Politic
government, In so much that at the time of his coronation, he is bound by an
oath to the observance and keeping of his own Law, which thing some Kings of
England not well brooking, as thinking that thereby they should not freely
govern their Subjects as other Kings do, whose rule is only regal,
gouernning their people by the Civil Law, and chiefly by that foresaid
Maxim of the same law, whereby they at their pleasure change Laws, make new
Laws, execute punishments, burden their subjects with charges: and also, when
they lust, do determine controversies of suitors, as pleases them. Wherefore,
these your progenitors went about to cast off the yoke politic, that they
also might likewise rule, or rather rage, over the people their subjects in
regal wise only: not considering that the power of both kings is equal, as
in the foresaid Treatise of the Law of Nature is declared: and that to rule
the people by government politic, is no yoke, but liberty, and great
security, not only to the subjects but also to the King himself: and
further no small lightning or easement to his charge. And that this may appear
more evident unto you, ponder and weigh the experience of both regiments, And
begin with the King of France, perusing after what sort he rules his subjects
by Regal government alone: And then come to the effect of the joint
governance, regal and politic, examining by experience, how and after what
manner, the King of England governs his subjects.

CAncellarius. No^ admirareris, Princeps, si causam huius conaminis me^te
solicita pertractares. Audisti nam que superius, quomodo inter leges Ciuiles
praecipua sententia est, maxima sieve regula, illa quae sic eanit, quod Principi
placuit, legis habet vigore^, qualiter non sanciunt leges Angliae, dum nedum
regaliter, sed and politice rex eiusde^ dominatur in populum suum, quo ipse, in
coronatione sua ad legis suae obseruanciam astringitur sacramento, quod reges
quidam Angliae aegre ferentes, puta^tes proinde se non libere dominari in
subditos, vt faciunt reges regaliter tantum principantes, qui lege civilly, and
potissime praedicta legis illius maxima, regulant plebem suam, quo ipsi, ad
eorum libitum, iura muta^t, noua condunt, paenas infligunt and onera imponunt
subditis suis, proprijs quoque arbitrijs, conte^ dentium, cum velint dirimunt
lites. Quare, moliti sunt ipsi progenitores tui hoc iugum politicu^ abijcere,
vt consimiliter and ipsi in sub iectum populu^ regaliter tantu^ dominari, sed
potius debacchari quea^t: no^ attendentes, quod aequalis est vtriusque Regis
pote^tia, vt in praedicto tractatu de Natura legis naturae docetur, and quoth non
iugu^ sed libertas est politice regere populu^, securitas quoque maxima nedu^
plebi, sed and ipsi regi, alleuatio etiam non minima solicitudinis suae. Quae
vt tibi apertius pa teant, vtriusque regiminis experientiam percunctare, and a
regimine tantum regali, qualiter Rex Fra^ciae principatur in subditos suos,
exordium sumito^ deinde a regalis and politici regiminis effectu, qualiter Rex
Angliae dominatur in sibi subditos populos, experientiam quaere.

The inconveniences, that happen in the Realm of France, through regal
government alone. Chap. 35.
CAll to remembrance, most worthy Prince, after what sort you saw the wealthy
Uillages and Towns (as touching store of Corn) in the Realm of France,
while you were there a soiourner, pestered with the Kings men at arms and
their horses, so that skant in any of the great towns there you could get any
lodging: Where, of the inhabiters you learned, that those men, though they
continue in one village a month or two, do not, nor will pay any thing at
all, either for their own charges, or for the charges of their horses, But
which is worse, they compelled the inhabytants of the Uillages and town
dwellers, whether they came, to provide of their own proper costs, out of the
villages adjoining, wine and flesh for them, and other things that they
needed, at dearer prices, then they might have bought the same at home. And if
any refused thus to do, they were anonne by plain Stafford Law forced to do
it: And when they had spent all the victuals, fuel, and horsemeat, in one
town, then those men went to an other town, wasting the same in like manner,
not paying one penie for any necessaries, either for themselves or else for
their concubines and harlots, whereof they ever carried about with them great
abundaunce, nor for hosen or shoes, and other like, even to ye lest point or
lace but they compelled ye townsme^ where they tarried to bear al their
expenses. And thus were al ye villages and unwalled towns of ye land used, so
yt there is not ye least village there, free from this miserable calamity, but
that it is once or twice every year beggered by this kind of pilling.
Furthermore ye King suffers no man to eat salt wtin his kingdom, except he
buy it of the king at such price, as pleases him to assesse. And if any poor
man had rather eat his meat fresh the^ to buy salt so excessiuely dear, he is
immediately compelled to buy so much of ye kings salt at ye kings price, as
shall suffice so many persons as he keeps in his house. Moreover all the
inhabiters of ye realm, give yearly to ye king, ye iiij. part of all the wines
yt their grounds bears: and every Vintener the fourth penny of ye price of the
wine that he sells And besides all this, every village and borough paieth
yearly to ye king great sums of money assessed upon them for the wages of men
at arms, so that the charges of the kings army, which is ever very great, is
maintained by ye poor people of the villages, boroughes, and towns of the
realm. And yet moreover, every village finds continually ij. Crossebowes at
ye least, and some more, with all furniture and habiliments, requisite for the
kings service in his wars, as often as it pleases him to muster the^ which he
does very often: And, these things not considered, other exceeding great tallages
are yearly assessed upon every village of ye same realm to ye kings use,
whereof they are no year relesed. The people being with these and diverse other
calamities, plaged and oppressed, do live in great misery, drinking water
daily, Neither do the inferior sort taste any other licor, saving only at
solemn feasts. Their shamewes are made of he^p, much like to sackcloth. Woollen
cloth they wear none except it be very course and ye only in their coats
under their said upper garments, neither use they any hosen, but from ye kne
upward: the residue of their legs go naked. Their women go barefoot saving on
holidaies, neither men nor women eat any flesh there, but only larde of bacon,
with a small quantity whereof they fatten their pottage and broths. As for roasted
or sodden meat of flesh they taste none, except it be of the inwards sometimes
and heads of beasts, that be killed for gentlemen and merchants. But the men
at arms, they devour and consume all their pulleine, so, that they have scant
the eggs left to eat for special dainties. And if they fortune at any time to
grow some what welthy in substance, so that any of them be counted rich, he
is by and by charged to the Kings Subsidy, more deeply then any of his
neighbors, so that within short time he is made equal in poverty with the rest
of his beggarly neighbors. And this, as I suppose is the state of the common
and rascal people of that nation. But Gentlemen and Nobles are not so
oppressed, and ouercharged with exactions. But if any of them chance to be
accused of any crime, though it be by his enemies, he is not ever wont to be
cited or called before an ordinary Judge: But many times it has been seen,
that he has in that behalf been talked with in the Kings Chamber, or
elsewhere in some private place, and sometimes only by a Purseuant or
Messenger: And immediately as soon as the Princes conscience has, through the
report of others, judged him guilty, he is without any fashion of judgment
put in a Sack, and in the night season by the Marshalls servants hurled into a
River, and so drowned. After which sort you have heard of many more put to
death, then that have been by ordinary process of the Law condemned.
Howbeit the Princes pleasure, as say the Civil laws, has the force of a
Law. Also, while you were abiding in France, and nigh to the same Kingdom,
you heard of other great enormyties like unto these, and some much worse then
these detestable and damnable, done no otherwise but under the color of that
Law, which here to rehearse would continue our talk too long a time. Now
therefore, let us see, what the effect of the Law politic and Regal, which
some of your progenitors would have changed into this civil, has wrought in
the Realm of England, that you being instructed with the experience of both
Laws, may the better by their effects judge, whether of them ye ought rather
to choose, Seeing the Philosopher, as before is rehearsed, does say, that
contraries laid together do more perfectly appear.

effectus legis, quam quidam progenitorum tuorum abijcere conati sunt. Superius
quoque tibi apparent effectus legis alterius, quam tanto zelo, loco legis
istius, ipsi nisi sunt inducere, vt ex fructibus earum tu agnoscas eas: Et,
nonne ambitio, luxus, and libido quos p^dicti progenitores tui, regni bono
praeferebant, eos ad hoc commercium concitabant? Considera igitur, Princeps
optime, and iam alia, quae sequentur.

WIthin ye Realm of England, no man soiorneth in an other man's house, without^
the love and the leave of the good man of the same house: saving in common
Innes, where before his departure thence, he shall fully satisfy and pay for
all his charges there: Neither shall he escape unpunished whosoever he be, that
takes another man's goods without the good will of the owner thereof, Neither
is it unlawful for any man in that Royalme, to provide and store himself, of
salt, and other merchandises, or wares, at his own will and pleasure, of any
man that sells the same. Howbeit, the King, though the owners would say nay,
may by his Officers take necessaries for his house, at a reasonable price, to
be assessed by the discretions of the Constables of the towns: Nevertheless,
he is bound by the Laws to pay therefore, either presently in hand, or else at
a day to be limited and set by the higher Officers of his house: For by his
Laws he may take away none of his Subjects goods, without due satisfaction
for the same. Neither does the King there, either by himself, or by his
Servants and Officers levy upon his subjects, Tallages, Subsidies, or any
other burdens, or alter their laws, or make new Laws, without the express
consent and agreement of his whole Realm in his Parliament. Wherefore every
inhabiter of that Realm, uses and enjoys at his pleasure, all the fruits
that his land or cattle bears, with all the profits and commodities, which by
his own travel, or by the labor of others, he gains by land or by water:
not hindered by the injury or wrong detainement of any manne, but that he
shall be allowed a reasonable recompense: And hereby it comes to pass,
that the men of that Land are rich, having abundance of Gold and Silver, and
other things necessary for the mainetenance of man's life. They drink no
water, unless it be so, that some for devotion and upon a zeal of penance,
do abstain from other drink, They eat plentifully of all kinds of flesh
and fish, They wear fine woollen cloth in all their apparel, They have also
abundance of bed couerings in their Houses, and of all other woollen stuff,
They have great store of all hustlements and implementes of householde. They
are plentifully furnished with all instruments of husbandry, and all other
things, that are requisite to the accomplishment of a quiet and wealthy life,
according to their estates and degrees. Neither are they sued in the Law, but
only before ordinary Judges, where by the Laws of the Land they are justly
entreated. Neither are they arrested or impleaded for their moueables or
possessions, or araigned of any offense criminal, be it never so great and
outrageous, but after the Laws of the Land, and before the Judges aforesaid.
And these are the fruits, which, government politic and regal conjoined,
does bear and bring forth: Whereof now appear evidently unto you the
experiences of the effects of the Law, which some of your progenitors traveled
to abolish. Before also you saw plainly the effects of the other Law, which
they with such earnest endeavor labored to advance and place in stead of this
Law, so that by the fruits of them both, you may know, what they are: And did
not ambition, riot, and wanton lust, which your said progenitors esteemed above
the wealth of the Realm, move them to this alteration? Consider therefore,
most worthy Prince, and that earnestly this that follows.

A comparison of the worthiness of both the regiments* Chap. 37.
SAnctus Thomas in libro, quem Regi Cipri de regimine principu^ scripsit,
dicit: quod Rex datur propter regnum, and non regnum propter Regem, quo omnis
potestas regia referri debet ad bonum regni sui, quod effectiue con sistit, in
defensione eiusdem ab exterorum incursibus, and in tuitione regnicolarum, and
bonorum suorum ab indigenarum iniurijs and rapinis. Quare, Rex, qui haec
peragere nequit, impotens est necessario iudicandus. Sed si ipse, passionibus
propriis, aut penuria, ita oppressus est, quod manus suas cohibere nequit a
depilatione subditorum suorum, quo ipsemet eos depauperat, nec viuere sinit and
sustentari proprijs substantijs suis: quanto tunc impotentior ille iudicandus
est, quam si eos defendere, ipse non sufficeret erga aliorum iniurias? Reuera,
Rex talis, nedum impotens, sed and ipsa impotentia, dicendus est: and non liber
iudicari potest, tantis impote^tiae nexubus vinculatus. E regione, Rex liber
and potens est, qui incolas suos erga exteros, and indigenas, eorum quoque bona
and facultates, nedum erga vicinorum and conciuium rapinas defendere sufficit,
sed erga propriam oppressionem, and rapinam, licet sibi passiones
necessitatesque huiusmodi relucte^tur. Quis enim potentior liberiorue esse
potest, quam qui, non solum alios: sed and se ipsum sufficit debellare? quod
potest, and semper facit, Rex politice regens populum suum. Quare experientiae
effectu tibi constat, princeps, progenitores tuos, qui sic politicum regimen
abijcere satagerunt, non solum in hoc non potuisse nanciscipotentia^, quam
optabant, videlicet ampliorem, sed and sui bonum, similiter and bonum Regni
sui, per hoc, ipsi discrimini exposuissent, and periculo gra^diori. Tamen haec
quae ia^ de experientiae effectu practicata, potentiam regis, regaliter tantum
praeside^tis, exprobrare vide^tur non ex legis suae defectu processerunt, sed
ex incuria negli ge^tiaque taliter principantis. Quare, ipsa, dignitatem illam
potentia non minuunt, a dignitate regis politice regula^tis, quos paris esse
potentiae, in praedicto tractatu de Natura legis Naturae, luculenter ostendi.
Sed potentiam regis regaliter tantum principantis difficilioris esse exercitij,
ac minoris securitatis sibi and populo suo, illa clarissime iam demonstrant,
quo optabile non for^t regi prudenti, regimen politicum pro tantum regali
commutare. Vnde and sanctus Thomas supradictus optare ce^setur, vt omnia mu^di
regna politice regerentur.

SAint Thomas in his book which he wrote to the king of Cyprus, of the
regiment of Princes, says, that the King is given for the kingdom, and not
the kingdom for the King, Whereupon it follows, that all kingly power must
be applied to the wealth of his kingdom, Which thing in effect consists, in
the defense thereof from foreign inuations, and in the maintenance of his
subjects, and their goods, from the injuries and extortions of the inhabitants
of the same. Wherefore, that king, which is not able to perform these things,
must of necessity be judged impotent and weak. But if he be so overcome of
his own affections and lusts, or so oppressed with poverty, that he can not
withhold his hands from the pilling of his subjects, whereby himself
impouerisheth them, and suffers them not to live and to be sustained upon
their own substances: how much more weak or feeble is he in this respect to
be judged, then if he were not able to defend them against the injuries of
others: Truly, such a King may well be called, not only feeble, but even very
feebleness it self: nor is not to be judged free, being tied with so many
bands of feebleness. On the other side, that King is free and of might, that
is able to defend his subjects, as well against strangers, as against his own
people: and also their goods and possessions, not only from the vyolent and
unlawful invasions of their own countrymen and neighbors, but also from his
own oppression and extortion, though such wilful lusts and necessities do
move him to the contrary. For who can be more mighty or more free, then
he, that is hable to conquer and subdue, not only others, but also himself?
Which thing a King, whose governance is politic, can do and ever does. Thus,
most worthy Prince, it appears unto you by the effect of experience, that
your progenitors, which were thus minded to renounce their politic
government, could not thereby not only not obtain the might and power, which
they wished, that is to say, increase thereof, but rather they should have
endaungered, and greatly hazarded, the wealth as well of themselves, as also of
their kingdom. Notwithstanding these things now practiced, which, as touching
the effect of experience, do seem to blemish the power of a king ruling al
alone regally, never proceeded of the default of their law, but of the careless
demeanor, and negligent loosenes of such a Ruler. Wherefore, that dignity is
not hereby in power imbased, under the dignity of a politic Governor,
which both, in my foresaid treatise of the Nature of the Law of Nature, I have
plainly proved to be in power equal. But the premises do most evidently
declare it to be a matter of much more diffcultie for a king whose rule is
only regal, to exercise his power, and that both he and his people, stand in
much less security, and therefore it were not to be wished of a wise king, to
change a politic regiment into that government, which is only regal. And
according to this, the foresaid Saint Thomas, wishes that all the kingdoms
of the world were ruled by politic governance.

The Prince breaks the Chancellor of his tale. Chap. 38.
Bear with me, I beseech you good Chancellor, quod the Prince, in that with
my questions I have drawn you so far from your purpose: For, the things, which
by this occasion you have discussed, are to me right profitable, though they
have somewhat stayed you, and pulled you back from the end of your intent,
Whereunto I pray you now make haste: and first as you promised, and as you have
begun, open unto me some other cases wherein the sentences of the laws of
England, and of the Civil laws, do disagree.

TVnc Princeps, parce, obsecro, Cancellarie, quod te ad tantam a proposito tuo
digressionem compuli quaestionibus meis, mihi namque perutilia sunt, quae hac
occasion exarasti, licet te parumper retardauerint a meta inte^tionis tuae ad
quam vt tu iam celerius properes, flagito, and primo, vt aliquos alios casus,
in quibus, legu^ Angliae, and Ciuiliu^ discrepant sente^tiae, vt promisisti and
coepisti, mihi ^narres.

The second case, wherein the Civil Laws, and the Laws of England, disagree
in their judgments. Chap. 39.
ACcording to your request, most noble Prince (quoth the Chancellor) I will
open unto you certain other cases, wherein the said Laws disagree. Howbeit,
whether of the same Laws in their judgments, excels the other, that will I
leave to your own determination. The Civil Law does legittimate the child
borne before matrimony, as well as that which is borne after: and gives unto
it succession in the Parents inheritance: But to the child borne out of
matrimony, the Law of England allows no succession, affirming it to be
natural only, and not lawful. The Ciuilia^s in this case, advance their Law,
alleging that by mean thereof, the sacrament or state of matrimony coming
in place, extinguisheth the former sin, whereby else the souls of two
persons should have perished: And it is to be presumed, say they, that they
were at their first copulation both so minded, as the sacrament ensuing
afterward declares. The Church also accepts such children for legitimate.
These, I trow, are the three strongest reasons, whereby they mainetaine and
defend their Law. Which are thus answered by the Lawiers of England: First,
they say, that the sin of the first carnal action, in the case propounded,
is not purged by the matrimony ensuinge, though by the worthiness thereof, the
sinners punishment is somewhat abated. They say also, that they, which thus do
sin, are so much the less repentant therefore, in as much as they perceive
the Laws to favor and bear with such transgressors: And upon this
consideration, they are made the redier to commit sin: thereby breaking the
commandment both of Gods and of the Church. Wherefore this Law does not only
participate with the offense of sinners, but also swarueth from the nature of a
good Law. Forasmuch as a Law is a holy stablishment, commanding things
honest, and forbidding the contrary: Which this Law does not, but rather
allureth the minds of sinners to dishonestie. Neither can it be any defense
to this Law, that the Church accepts such Children for legittimate. For that
loving mother dispenses in many things, which she licenceth to be done, And
it was by way of dispensation, that the Apostle sets Uirgines at liberty,
whereunto he would not counsel them, rather wishing all to continue Uirgines
like himself. And God forbid, that so great a mother, should in this case
withdraw her tender love from her children, which by the intisement of this Law
do many times fall into sin.

And by the matrimony ensuing, The Church is informed, that the parties so
marrying are penitent and sorry for the offense passed, and are willing in time
to come, through matrimony, to live continent. But the Law of England, in
this case, works a much contrary effect, For it provoke not to sin, nor
cherishes or maintains sinners, but puts them in fear, and to keep them
from sin threateneth punishment: For the wantonness of the flesh has no
need of allurement, but rather of discouragement: because the lusts of the
flesh are wanton, and almost untameable. And forasmuch as it is impossible for
man to live ever in himself, he naturally coueteth to live ever in his like,
because every living thing desires to be like the first and chief cause,
which is perpetual and everlasting. And hereof it comes, that man has more
delight and pleasure in the sense of feeling, whereby his kind is preserved, then
in the sense of taste, which preserves only the particular man. Wherefore Noe,
executing vengeance upon his son which uncovered his priuities, did curse his
Nephew the offenders child, that thereby the offender might be more grieved
then with his own mishap: Wherefore the Law that punishes the offenders
issue, does more penally prohibit sin, then that, which plagueth but the
offender alone. Whereby it may easily be considered with what zele the Law of
England abhors unlawful conjunctions, which does not only judge the child
so gotten to be illegittimat, but also prohibiteth it to succeed in the parents
inheritance. Is not this law then chaste and pure? And does it not more
forceably and more earnestly suppress sin, then the foresaid civil Law,
which winketh at the sin of lechery, and leaves it unpunished?

CAncellarius. Quosda^ casus alios, in quibus dissentiunt Leges praedictae, vt
petis princeps, detegere conabor. Sed tamen quae legu^ earu^ praesta^tior sit
in iuditijs suis, non meo sed arbitratui tuo relinquam. Prolem ante matrimonium
nata^, ita vt post, legitima^, lex ciuilis, and succedere facit in haereditate
parentum: sed prolem, quam matrimoniu^ non parit, succedere non sini^ lex
Anglorum, naturale^ tantu^ eam esse, and non legititimam proclamans. Ciuilistae
in casu hoc, lege^ eorum extollunt, quia incitame^tu^ ea^ esse dicunt, quo
matrimonij sacrame^to cesset peccatum, per quod alias duorum animae interire^t:
prae sumendum quoque esse dicunt, tales fuisse contrahentium animos in primo
eorum concubitu, quales esse demo^strat subsequens sacramentum. Ecclesia etia^,
foetus hm^di habet pro legitimis, haec, ni fallor, tria fulcime^ta su^t maiora,
quibus ipsi appro bant, defenduntque lege^ suam. Ad quae, sic respondent legis
Angliae periti: primo dicunt quod peccatu^ primi concubitus, in casu proposito,
no^ purgatur per subsequens matrimonium, licet eius merito delinquentiu^ quodam
modo minuatur poena. Dicu^t etia^ quoth peccati illius co^scij, ta^to minus inde
poenitent, quo leges tra^sgressoribus illis fauere considerant: Quali etiam
consideratione, procliuiores ipsi redduntur ad co^mittendu^ peccatu^, per quoth,
nedum Dei, sed and ecclesiae praecepta negligu^t. Un de lex illa, nedum
delinquentiu^ participat culpa^, sed and legis bonae natural ipsa declinat: cum
lex sit sanctio sancta, iubens honesta, and prohibens contraria: qualia ipsa
non pro hibet, sed potius ad inhonesta animos labe^tium inuitat. Nec vallari
potest lex ista per hoc, quoth ecclesia foetus hm^di pro legi^^^is habet. Pia
namque matter illa, in qua^plurimis dispensat, quae fieri ipsa non co^cedit,
dispensatina enim laxauit Apostolus virginitatis fraena quoth co^sulere noluit,
cu^ oe^s ipse voluerit, vt se virgins permansisse. Et absit, vt matter tanta, a
filijs suis in casu isto pietatem sua^ cohiberet, dum saepe ipsi, etia^ legis
huius ciuilis fomento co^citati, incidu^t in peccatum.

Et per matrimonium subsequens docetur Ecclesia, contrahentes poenitere de
preterito, and de futuro per matrimonium se velle cohibere, Sed long alium, in
hoc casu, lex Angliae effectum operatur, dum ipsa non concitat ad peccatum,
neque peccantes ^ouet, sed terret eos, and ne peccent, minatur poenas: carnis
etenim illicebrae fomento non egent, egent vero froenis, quia irritame^ta
carnis lasciua and quasi infatigabilia sunt. Et homo, quum indiuiduo perpetuari
nequit, perpetuari naturaliter appetit in specie sua, quia omne, quoth viuit,
assimilari cupit causae primae, quae perpetua est and aeterna. Vnde fit, quod
plus de^ectatur homo in sensu tactus, quo seruatur species eius, qua^ in sensu
gustus, quo conseruatur indiuiduum. Quare Noe, vlciscens in filium qui eius
pudenda reuelauit, nepoti suo, filio delinque^tis, maledixit, vt inde plus
cruciaretur reus, qua^ proprio possit inco^modo: quare lex, quae vindicat in
progeniem delinquentis, penalius prohibet peccatum, quam quae solum
delinquentem f^agellat. Ex quibus co^siderare licet, qua^tozelo lex Angliae
illicitos prosequitur concubitus, du^ ex eis edita^ prole^, ipsa, nedum iudicat
non esse legittima^, sed and succedere prohibet in patrimonio parentu^. Nu^
quid tunc, lex ista casta non est? and no^ fortius firmiusque repellit
peccatu^, qua^ facit lex praedicta ciuilis, quae cito, and quasi inultu^
luxuriae crime^ remittit?

Special causes, why base borne children, are not legittimate in England by
matrimony ensuing. Chap. 40.
Moreover, the Civil laws say, that your natural or bastard son is the
son of the people. Whereof a certain Metritian writes in this wise. To who^
the people father is, to him is father none and all:

To who^ the people father is, well fatherless we may him call.

And while such a child had no Father at the time of his birth, surely nature
knows not how he could afterward come by a Father: For, if one woman should
bear two childen of two Fornicatours, and the one of them should afterward
marry her: Whether of these two children should by this marriage be
legittimate? Opinion may somewhat persuade, but reason cannot find: seeing the
time was once, when both those children, being judged the children of the
people, did not know their fathers. It were therefore unreasonable, that a
child afterward borne in the same wedlock, whose generation cannot be unknown,
should be disherited, and that a child which knows no father, should be
heir to the father and mother of the other, specialally in the realm of
England, where the eldest son only inioyeth the fathers inheritance, And an
indifferent Judge would think it no less unreasonable, that a base borne
child should be equally matched with a lawful begotten child in the
inheritance, which by the Civil laws can be divided but only among male
children. For Saint Augustine in the xvi. book de Ciuitate Dei writes thus:
Abraham gave all his substance to his son Isaac: and to the sons of his
concubines he gave gifts: Whereupon seems to be meant, that to bastard
children there is no inheritance due, but only a necessary living. Thus says
he. And under the name of a bastard child, S. Augustine understands all
unlawful issues, and so does holy Scripture also in diverse places, calling
none by the name of a bastard. Lo, Saint Augustine thinks no small
difference to be, and so thinks Abraham too, between the succession of a
bastard, and of a son lawfully begotten. Yea, holy Scripture reprehendeth all
unlawful children under this Metaphor, saying, bastard slippes shall take no
deep root, nor lay any fast foundation, in the fourth chapter of the book of
Wisdom. The Church also reprooueth the same, in that it admits them not to
holy orders, And if so be, that the Church do dispense with such a one, yet
it permits not him to have any dignity or preeminence in the Church,
Wherefore it is convenient, that man's law in the benefit of succession,
should cut them short, whom the Church iudgeeth unworthy to be received in
holy orders, and rejects from all prelacie: yea whom holy Scripture judges,
as touching their birth, much inferior to them that be lawfully begotten. We
read, that Gedeon the puissant begat threescore and ten sons in wedlock,
and but one only out of wedlock, yet this misbegotten child wickedly slew al
those lawfully begotten children, one only excepted, Judges the ninth chapter:
Whereby it is perceived, that there was more wickedness in one Bastard child,
then in lxix. lawful sons. For it is a common saying: If a bastard be good,
that comes to him by chance, that is to wit, by special grace, but if he
be evil that comes to him by nature. For it is thought, that the base
child draws a certain corruption and stain from the sin of his parents,
without his own fault, as all we have received of the sin of our first
parents, much infection, though not so much, Howbeit the blemish, which
bastards by their generation do receive, much differs from that wherein
lawful children are borne, For their conception is wrought by the mutual
sinful lust of both parents, which in the lawful and chaste copulation of
married couples takes no place, The sin of such fornicators is committed by
the mutual consent of them both, Wherefore it is likened to the first sin, and
cleaves more cruelly to the child, then the sin of such as do otherwise
offend alone: so that the Child so begotten deserves to be called the child
of sin, rather then the child of sinners, wherefore the Book of Wisdom
making a difference between these two generations, of the lawful generation
it says thus: O how fair is a chaste generation with virtue! The memorial
thereof is immortal: For it is known with GOD and with men. But the other is
not known with men, so that the children thereof borne, are called the
children of the people. Of which base generation, the same book thus speaks:
All the children, that are borne of wicked parents, are witnesses of
wickedness against their parents, when they be asked. For being demanded
of their parents they open their sin, even as the wicked son of Noe
uncovered his fathers priuities. It is therefore believed touching the blind
borne, of whom the Pharisees in the ninth Chapter of Saint John's Gospel said:
thou art all together borne in sin: that he was a bastard, who wholly is
borne of sin: and where it follows do thou teach us, It seems that
thereby may be understood, that a bastard has no like natural disposition
to knowledge and learning, as a lawful child has. Wherefore, that law makes no
good division, which in the fathers inheritance makes equal bastard
children and lawful children, whom the Church in Gods inheritance makes
unequal, Between whom also Scripture puts a difference in form above
mentioned: and when nature in her gifts seuereth, marking the natuall or
bastard children, as it were, with a certain privy mark in their souls.
Whether therefore of the two laws, English or Civil, do you now embrace, most
noble Prince, and judge to have the pre-eminence in this case.

PRaeterea leges ciuiles dicu^t, filiu^ naturalem tuum esse filium populi, de
quo metricus quida^ sic ait Cui pater est populus, pater est sibi, nullus, and
omnis. Cui pater est populus, non habet ipse patrem. Et dum proles talis patrem
non habuit tempore natiuitatis suae, quomodo ex postfacto ipse patrem nanscici
poterit, natura non nouit: quo, si ex fornicatoribus duobus, mulier vna filios
pe perit duos, qua^ postea, vnus ex concubinarijs illis ducat i^ vxore^, quis
ex filijs hijs duobus, per matrimonium illud legittimatur? Opinio suadere
potest, sed ratio reperire nequit, dum ambo filij illi populi foetus iudicati,
semel parents ignorabant. Inconsonu^ propterea videretur, quod in matrimonio
illo extunc ab eade^ muliere natus, cuius generatio ignorari no^ poterit,
expers esset haereditatis, and filius nescius genitoris sui^ succederet patri
and matri eius, maxim infra regnu^ Angliae, vbi filius senior solus succedit
in haereditate paterna, and no^ minus incongruum esse sentiret abiter aequus,
si filius ex stupro, aequaliter perticiparet cum filio ex legitimo thoro,
haereditatem, quae iure civilly inter masculos diuide^da est. Nam sanctus
Augustinus xvj, lib. de Ciuitate Dei, sic scribit: Abraham omnem censum suum
dedit Isaac filio suo, filijs autem concubinarum dedit dationes: Ex quo videtur
innui, quoth spurijs non debetur haereditas, sed victus necessitas. Haec ille. Sub
nomine vero spurij, denotat Augustinus, omne^ foetu^ illegittimu^, qualiter and
saepius facit scriptura sacra, quae neminem vocat bastardum. Ecce, differentiam
non minimam sentit Augustinus, sentit and Abraham, inter successionem spurij,
and filij ex legittimo concubitu. Caeterum, omnes filios illegittimos
reprehendit Scriptura sacra, sub Metaphora hac, dicens: spuria vitulamina non
dabunt radices altas, nec stabile fundamentum collocabunt, Sapientiae iiij.
Reprehendit and ecclesia, quae eos a sacris repellit ordinibus, and si cum tali
dispensauerit, non eum tame^ permittit dignitate praeesse in ecclesia Dei

ecclesia indignos iudicat sacro ordine, and quos ipsa repellit ab omni
praelatia: ipsos etia^, quos Scriptura sacra in natalibus, minoratos iudicat a
legittime procreatis. Gedeon autem virorum fortissimus, lxx. filios in
ma^rimoni o legitur procreasse, and no^ nisi vnum solum habuisse ex co^cubina
filius tamen ipse concubinae, omnes filios illos legittimos nequiter peremit,

The Prince allows the Law, which does not legittimate children borne before
matrimony, Chap. 41.
SUrely, even to that law do I give the preferment, quoth the Prince, which is
of more force to abandon sin out of the Realm, and to advance virtue. Those
also in the benefit, of man's law do I suppose abject and base, who^ the Law of
God considers unworthy, and whom the Church in her benefits rejects, and
nature also judges more prone unto sin. I think you do not judge amiss, quod
the Chancellor. Wherefore I will rehearse yet other cases, wherein the said
Laws disagree.

LEges ciuiles fa^ciunt, quod partus semper sequitur ventre^, vt si mulier
seruilis conditionis nubat viro co^ditionis liberae, Proles eorum seruus crit:
and e conuerso, seruus maritatus liberae, no^ nisi liberos gignit. Sed lex
Angliae nu^qua^ matris, sed semper patris conditione^ imitari partu^ iudicat.
Vt ex libera, etia^ ex natiua, no^ ni si liberu^ liber generet, and no^ nisi
seruu^ in matrimonio procreare potest seruus. Quae, putas, legum harum melior
est in sente^cijs suis? crude lis est lex, quae liberi prole^ sine culpa subdit
seruituti. Nec minus crudelis censetur, quae liberae sobole^ sine merito
redigit in seruitutem. Legistae vero dicunt, leges Ciuiles p^ualere i^ hijs

Neque arbor bona fructus malos facere. Acomnis legis sente^tia est, quoth
pla^tatio quae libet cedit solo quo inseritur, Certior quoque multo est partus,
quae eu^ fuderu^tviscera, qua^ quis eu^ pater procreauit. Ad haec, legis
Angliae consulti dicu^t q^od partus ex legittimo thoro, non certius noscit
matrem quam genitorem suum. Nam ambae leges, quae ia^ contendunt, vniformiter
dicunt, quod ipse est pater, quem nuptiae demonstrant. Nunquid tunc magis est
conuenie^s, vt filij co^ditio ad patris, potius quam ad matris co^ditionem
referatur, cum de coniugatis dixerat Adam? erunt ipsi duo in carne vna, quoth
dominus exponens in Euangelio ait: Iam non sunt duo, sed vna caro, and cum
masculinum concipiat faemininum, ad masculinum quod dignius est, referri debet
tota caro sic facta vna, Quare Adam and Euam vocauit dominus, non Euam sed quia
caro (...) ipsi era^t* ambo^ eos vocauit ipse nomine vi^i, videlicet, Adam: vt
pa^et Genesis quinto capitulo. Ipsae quoque ciuiles leges dicunt: quod mulieres
semper corusca^t, radijs maritorum suorum. Vnde C. qui professione se excusant,
libro nono, l. fi. textus sic loquitur: Mulieres honor maritorum crigimus, and
genere nobilitamus, and forum ex eorum persona statuimus, and domicilium
mutamus. Sin autem minoris ordinis viru^ postea sortitae, priore dignitate
priuatae, posterioris mariti consequantur conditionem and domicilium. Et cum
nomen patris, and non matris, gerat proles omnis, and maxim masculina, Vnde
tunc prouenire poterit, quoth filius, ratione matris, amitteret honore^,
conditionemue patris sui mutaret, cuius tamen nomen ipse retinebit praesertim
dum honor patris eiusde^ ac condition resplendeat matter eius, and dum viri
honor vel conditio nunqua^ per vxoris vitium denigratur. Crudelis ne^pe
censeretur lex, quae sine causa, filiu^ liberi seruituti committit and terra^,
pro qua liber ille innocens a crimine, sud auit innoce^tis filij sui titulo,
non sudanti, tradet extraneo possidendam, ac patris nomen, etia^ filij
seruitutis nota co^maculat. Crudelis etia^ necessario iudicabitur lex, quae
seruitutem augmentat, and minuit libertatem. Nam pro ea natura semper implorat
humana. Quia, ab homine, and pro vicio, introducta est seruitus. Sed libertas a
Deo hominis est indita naturae. Quare ipsa ab homine sublata, se^per redire
gliscit, vt facit omne, quod liberate naturali priuatur. Quo ipse and
crudelis, iudica^dus est, qui libertati non fauet. Haec considerantia Angliae
iura, in omni casu libertati da^t fauore^. Et licet iura illa iudicent eum
seruum, quem seruus in coniugio ex libera procreauit, non per hoc, iura illa
rigida, crudeliaue sentiri poterunt. Nam mulier, quae coniugio seruo se
subiecit facta ei caro vna, quo ipsa, vt dicunt leges suprascriptae, cius
consequitur co^ditionem, and proprio arbitrio se fecit ancillam, sed potius
seruam, nullatenus a lege coacta, qualiter and faciunt, qui se seruos reddunt
in curijs regum, vel in seruitutem se vendunt, nulla tenus ad hoc compulsi. Quo
modo tunc, liberu^ sancire possunt leges filium illum, que^ matter talis,
taliter est enixa? Nunquam enim sic subiectus est vir vxori, licet maxima
Domina ipsa fuerit, v: subiecta est libera haec seruo, que^ ipsa facit dominum
eius, dicente Domino vxori omni, Eris sub potestate viri, and ipse dominabitur
tibi, Et quid est, quod dicunt legistae illi de fructu arboris bonae vel malae,
nonne co^ditionis liberae vel seruilis, est vxor omnis, qualis est maritus
eius? Et in cuius solo plantauit maritus, du^ vxor eius est sibi caro vna?
Nonne in proprio? Quid si surculu^ dulcis naturae inseuerit ipsesti piti
arboris acerbae: Du^modoarbor illa eius est, no^ne fructus (licet ex stipite
redolent) se^per sint fructus eius: Sic ex muliere genita proles, mariti est
progenies, fuerit matter libera vel ancilla. San^^u^t tame^ leges Angliae* quoth
dominus natiuae a libero in matrimoniu^ sumptae ipso inco^sulto, cum ea^
repudiare nequeat, dice^te Euangelio: quos deus coniunxit, homo non separet:
recuperabit versus liberum illum, omne damnu^, quoth ipse sustinuit ratione
deperditi^ seruitij, and amissae ancillae. Haec ia^ vt aestimo, est su^ma and
forma legis Angliae, in casu ia^ enarrato. Quid igitur ia^ tibi videtur,
Princeps, in casu isto? and quae legu^ p^dictaru^ praestantior aut eligibilior
a te iudicatur?

THe Civil Laws decree, that the issue ever follows the womb, that is to
say, the mother. As for example, if a bond woman be married to a free man,
their issue shall be bond: And contrariwise if a bond man marieth a free
woman, he begets none but free children. But the Law of England never
judges that issue to follow the mothers condition, but always the fathers. So
that a free man begets free children as well of a bondwoma^, as of a free
woman, and a bondsman in wedlock can beget none other but bond children.
Whether of these laws is better think you in their sentences? It is a cruel
law, which without offense subdueth the free man's child to bondage. And no
less cruelty is to be thought in the law, which without any desert
oppresses the free woman's child with bondage. Yet the Ciuilians say, that the
Civil Laws in these their judgments do excel. For an evil tree, say they, can
not bring forth good fruits, nor a good tree bear evil fruits. And by the
consent of all Laws it is agreed, that every plant yields to the nature of
the ground wherein it is planted, the child also has much more certain and
sure knowledge of the mother, then of the father. Whereunto the Lawiers of
England answer on this wise: That a child lawfully begotten has no more
certain and sure knowledge of the mother then of the father. For both these
laws thus disagreeing, agree yet in this point, that he is the father, whom
wedlock declares. And is it not then more convenient, that the condition of
the child should have relation rather to the fathers condition, then to the
mothers, Seeing that Adam speaking of married couples, said: They shall be two
in one flesh, which our Lord expounding in the Gospel says: Now are they not
two but one flesh. And for so much as the male, as more worthy, contains the
female, the^ the whole flesh so united must have relation to the male as to the
worthier, wherefore the Lord called Adam and Eve not by the name of Eve, but
because they were both one flesh, he called them both in the name of Adam, the
man, as it appears in the fifth chapter of Genesis. The Civil Laws also
hold that women do ever glister with the shining beams of their husbands.
Wherefore in the title beginning with these words: Qui se professione excusant,
in the 9. Book L. fi. the text says thus, we auaunce women with the honor of
their husbands, and with the kindred of their husbands we worship them, in the
court we decre matters to pass in the name of their husbands, and into the
house and surname of their husbands do we translate the^. But if afterward a
woman marie with a man of baser degree, then loses she her former dignity,
and follows the condition of her latter husband, And for so much as all
children, specially male children, bear the fathers name, and not ye mothers,
whereof then should it come, that the son by reason of the mother should lose
the honor, or change the condition of the father, whose name nevertheless he
shall still keep, Specially seeing the mother her self receives of the same
Father, honor, worship and dignity which honor, worship and dignity of the
husband can never be desteined or impeached through the fault of ye wife. Truly
that law may well be deemed cruel, which without any cause, commits to
bondage the fremans son, and which, disheriting the innocent son of the
innocent free father, adiudgeth his land to an unworthy stranger, which also
with the base state of bondage in the son defaceth the name of the fre
father. Cruel also of necessity must that law be counted, which augmenteth
thraldom, and diminishes liberty or freedom. For liberty is the thing that
man's nature ever coueteth. For, by man and for sin, did bondage first enter.
But freedom is graffed in man's nature of God. Whereof if men be deprived, he
is ever desirous to recover the same again, like as al other things do, that
are spoiled of their natural liberty. Wherefore wicked and cruel is he to
be deemed that favors not liberty. Which things the Laws of England, duly
considering do in all respects show favor to liberty. And though the same
laws judge him thrall, whom a bondsman in wedlock begets of a free woman,
yet hereby cannot these laws be reputed severe and cruel. For a woman, which
by marriage has submitted herself to a bondsman, is made one flesh with him,
wherefore as the foresaid Laws determine, she follows the state of his
condition, and of her own free will has made her self a bond woman, not
forced there to by the Law, much like to such, as in Kings Courts become
bondemen, or sell themselves into bondage without any compulsion at all. And
how then can the Law determine the child to be free, whom such a mother has
thus borne? For the husband can never be in so much subjection to his wife,
though she be a right great Lady, as this woman is subject to the bond man,
whom she has made her Lord, insomuch as the Lord says to all wives: Thou
shall be under the power of thy husband, And he shall have dominion over
thee, And what is it that these Ciuilians say of the fruit of a good or evil
tree, Is not every wife of a free or thrall condition, according to the state
of her husband? And in whose ground has the husband planted, while his wife is
one flesh with him? Not in his own? And what then if he have graffed a slip
of a sweet nature in a stock of a sower tree: So that the tree be his own,
shall not the fruits, though they ever sauer of the stock, be his own
fruits? So the child, which the wife bears is the husbands issue, whether
the wife be free or thrall. Howbeit the Laws of England decree, that if a
bond woman, without the consent of her lord, be married to a free man, though
they cannot be deuorced, because the Gospel says, whom God has conjoined,
let no man separate, yet shall her lord recover against the same freeman all
the damages, that he has sustained by reason of ye loss of his vassal or
bo^d woman. This now, as I suppose, is the sum and form of the law of
England in the case now declared. What therefore is your opinion most excellent
Prince, in the same case? And whether of these two laws do you esteem to be of
more worthiness and excellency?

The Prince approves the Law, whereby the issue follows not the womb. Cha.

PRinceps, Anglo rum lege^ in hoc casu Romanoru^ legi praestare dubitare nos
ratio no^ permittit. Et optatior mihi semper est lex, quae fauorem potius qua^
rigore^, partibus administrat. Recolo na^que illius iuris reg^ia^, quae sic
dicit: O^^a perstringi, and (...) conuenit ampl^ari. Can^ellarius, Et been
quidem. Aliu^ adhuc casum tibi referam, princeps, in quo concertant leges
istae, and no^ multum postea, tu^c desista^, ne onerosu^ tibi sit, ta^tis
solicitari scismatibus, etia^ ne in fastidiu^ tibi veni at desceptatio mea
diutius protelata.

REason suffers us not to doubt (quod the Prince) but that in this case the
law of England surmounteth the Roman Law. And that Law is to me more
allowable, which unto children shows favor, rather then rigor. For I
remember a rule of the Law, that says: It is behooueable that cruel hate be
repressed, and favor advanced. And good reason (quod the Chancellor) Yet will
I e^presse unto you an other case, wherein these Laws are repugnant, And
shortly after I will make an end, least it be tedious to you, to be troubled
with so many disagreeings, and lest you happen to be wearied with my over long
talk.

The fourth case, wherein the said Laws vary. Chap. 44.
THe Civil laws commit the tuition of Orphans to the next of their blood,
whether the kindred grow on the fathers side, or on ye mother side, that is to
say, to every man according to the degree and order, wherein his turn is next
to succeed the pupil in his inheritance. And the reason of this law is for
that no man will behave himself more tenderly or more favorably in the
careful education of the Infant, the^ he that is next of his blood.

Nevertheless the Laws of England, touching the custody of Orphans, do
determine much otherwise. For there, if an inheritance, being holden in Socage
descend to an Orphane, from any of the kindred of his Fathers side, the same
Orphane shall not be under the keeping of any of that kindred but he shall be
governed by his cosins or kinsfolk of his mothers side. And if the inheritance
come to him from any kinesman of his mothers side, then the pupil with his
inheritance shall be in the custody, till he come to lawful age, of him
that is next of his kin of his fathers side, and not of any kinesman of the
mothers side. For our laws say, that to commit the tuition of an infant to
him, that shall next succeed him, is like as if one should betake a lamb unto
a Wolf to be devoured. But if the inheritance be not holden in socage, but by
Knights service, then by the Laws of the same land, the child with his
inheritance shall be in the keeping of none of his kindred of neither side,
but in the custody of the Lord of the fee, until he come to the age of one
and twenty years. And think you, that any man can or will better instruct
and train up the child in feats of Arms, which, by reason of his tenure,
he is bound to yield to ye Lord of his fee, then the Lord himself, to whom
such service is by him due? Which is also to be judged of more power and
honor, then the friends and kinsfolk of his tenant. For he, to the intent
he may in time to come be the better served of his tenant, will use the more
diligence toward him, And it is to be presumed, that he is more expert and
skillful to trade him in these things, then his other friends, rude
peradventure and unpracticed in martial feats, specially if his patrimony
be but small. And what can be more profitable for the child, which by reason
of his tenure, shall in the service of his Lord, endanger his life and all that
he has, in the acts of Chivalry, then in his nonage, to be brought up in
the discipline and practice of the same, seeing that in his ripe age he shall
not be able to avoid the adventure thereof? And to say the truth, it shall
be no small commodity for the Realm, that the inhabiters of the same be
well expert in the knowledge of Arms. For, as says the Philosopher, every man
does the things boldly, wherein he assures himself to be skilful. And do you
not then, most noble Prince, allow this Law, and commend it above the other
now described?

LEges ciuiles, impuberum tutelas, proximis de eorum sanguine, committunt,
agnati fuerint seu cognati, vnicuique videlicet secundum gradum and ordinem,
quo in haereditate pupilli successurus est. Et ratio legis huius est, quia
nullus, tenerius fauorabiliusue infantem alere sataget quam proximus de
sanguine eius.

Tamen long aliter de impuberum custodia statuunt leges Angliae. Nam ibidem,
si haereditas, quae tenetur in Socagio, descendat impuberi ab aliquo agnatorum
suorum, non erit impubes ille, sub custodia alicuius agnatorum eius, Sed per
ipsos cognatos, videlicet, consanguineos ex part matris ipse regetur. Et si ex
part cognatorum haereditas sibi descenderit, pupillus ille cum haereditate
sua, per proximu^ agnatum, and non cognatu^ eius custodietur, Quousque ipse
fuerit adultus. Nam leges illae dicunt quod co^mittere tutelam infantis illi
qui est ei proxime successurus, est quasi agnum committere lupo ad deuora^dum.
Sed si haereditas illa, non in socagio, sed teneatur per seruitium militare,
tu^c per leges terrae illius, infans ipse and haereditas eius non per agnatos
neque cognatos, sed per dominum foeodi illius custodientur, quousque ipse
fuerit etatis viginti and vnius annoru^. Quis, putas, infante^ tale^, in
actibus bellicis, quos facere, ratione tenurae suae, ipse astri^ gitur domino
feodi sui, melius instruere poterit, aut velit, quam dominus ille, cui ab eo
seruitium tale debetur? and qui maioris potentiae and honoris estimatur, qua^
sunt alij amici propinqui tenentis sui? Ipse namque vt sibi ab eodem tenente
melius seruiatur, diligente^ cura^ adhibebit, and melius in his eum erudire
expertus esse censetur, quam reliqui amici iuuenis rudes forsan and armorum
inexperti, maxim si non magnum fuerit patrimonium eius. Et quoth vtilius est
infanti, qui vitam and omnia sua periculis bellicis exponet in seruicio domini
sui ratione tenurae suae, quam in militia actubusque bellicis imbui, dum minor
est, cum actus huiusmodi ipse in aetate matura declinare non poterit? Et
reuera, non minime erit regno accommodum, vt incolae eius in armis sint
experti. Nam, vt dicit Philosophus, audacter quilibet facit, quod se scire ipse
non diffidit. Nunquid tunc legem hanc, tu approbas, fili Regis, and collandas
super Legem alteram iam descriptam?

Here, the Prince commends the education of Noble men's children being
Orphans. Chap. 45.
PRinceps, Immo, Cancellarie, legem hanc, plusqua^ alteram, ego laudo. Nam, in
eius part prima quam tu notasti, caute magis, quam ciuilis, ipsa prouidet
securitati pupilli. Sedtame^ in eius part secunda, multo magis ego delector*
nam ab ea est, quoth in Anglia, nobilium progenies de facili degenerari no^
potest, sed probitate potius, strenuitate, and morum honestate, antecessores
suos ipsa transcendet, dum in altiori, nobiliorique curia, quam in domo
parentum, illa sit imbuta, licet in domo consimili forsan parents eius educati
erant: Quia consimilis adhuc non erat, domus parentum illoru^, domui Dominorum,
quibus, ipsi pare^tes, and ipsi infantes, seruieru^t. Principes quoque regni
sub hac lege regulati, similiter and domini alij a rege immediate tenentes, non
possunt de leui in lasciuiam ruditatemue labi, cum in pueritia, dum Orphani
fuerint ipsi, in do mo regia nutriu^tur. Quare non infime domus regiae

nobilitatis regni schola quoque strenuitatis, probitatis, and morum quibus
regnu^ honoratur, et floret ac co^tra irruentes securatur, etiam formido, ipsa
erit, inimicis and amicis regni. Hoc reuera bonum accidisse non potuisset regno
illi, si nobilium filij, orphani and pupilli, per pauperes amicos parentum
suorum nutrirentur. Nec regni bono officere potest, licet burgensium filij and
alioru^ libere tenentium, qui in focagio tene^t tenementa sua, quo ipsi ad
militiam no^ astringuntur, in domo consimilium amicoru^ suoru^ educa^tur, vt
perspicue consideranti, lucide apparere potest.

YEs, good Chancellor, quoth the Prince, this Law I do allow much more then
the other. For in ye first part of it, which you noted, it provides much more
warily for the security and safeguard of the pupil, then the Civil law does.
Howbeit in the second part of the same, I do take more delight. For thereof it
comes to pass, that in England Noble men's children cannot easily degenerat,
but rather pass and surmount their ancestors in virtue, in courage, and in
honest conditions, for so much as they are brought up and instructed in an higher
and an honourabler Court, then in the houses of their Parents, though their
Parents were peradventure brought up in the like places: For their Parents
house was never yet like the Lords house, whom as well the Parents, as also the
Children served. The Princes also of the Realm, being ruled by this Law, and
likewise other Lords, holding their Land immediately of the King, cannot
lightly fall to wantonness and unseemliness, seeing that in their
childhoode, while they be Orphans, they are brought up in the Kings house,
wherefore I must needs highly praise and commend the riches and high port of
ye Kings Court, in that it is the chiefest school within the Realm, for the
Nobility of the Land. It is also the Schoolehouse of manhood, of virtue, and of
good manners, whereby the Realm is honored, and flourishes, and is preserved
against invasions: so that it is dreaded both of friends and foes. And to be
plain, this great commodity could not have happened to the Realm, if Noble
men's children, being Orphans and pupilles, had been nourished and brought up
by the poor friends of their Parents. Neither can this be prejudicial or
hurtful to the wealth of the Realm, that the Children of Burgesses, and of
other freeholders, which hold their tenements in ^ocage, and are not thereby
bound to warfare, are brought up in ye houses of their like friends, as to him,
that shall thoroughly weigh ye matter, it may evidently appear.

Yet he rehearses other cases, wherein the foresaid Laws differ. Chap. 46.
THere be yet diverse other cases, quod the Chancellor, wherein, the Laws
aforesaid do vary. As in that the Civil Laws do judge, open Theft, to be
satisfied by the recompense of foure-folde, and privy Theft, by the recompense
of double. But the Laws of England suffer neither of those offenses to be
more favorably punyshed, then with the offenders death, so that the value of
the thing stolen, be above the value of twelve pence. Also a libertine, that
is to say, a freeman, that sometime was bond, if he become unkind or
churlishe, the Civil Laws reduce him into his former state of servitude
again: But by the Laws of England he, that is once made free, be he grate
or ingrate, is adjudged to enjoy his Freedom still. There be other like cases
also not a few, which at this time for breuites sake I ouerpasse. Neither in
these two cases, do I dispute the excellency of the foresaid Laws, seeing
the qualities of the^ require no great search. And I doubt not, but the
quickness of your wit is such, that it can sufficiently discuss the same*

TVnc Cancellarius. Sunt and alij casus nonnulli, in quibus differu^t leges
antedictae. Vt quia leges ciuiles iudica^t furtum manifestum, per redditione^
quadrupli: and furtum no^ manifest^m, per dupli reco^pensatione^, expiari. Sed
leges Angliae, neutrum facinorum illorum, mitius quam co^mittentis morte puniri
permittunt, dummodo ablati valor, duodecim denarioru^ valorem excedat. Item
libertinum, ingratum, leges ciuiles in pristina^ redigunt seruitute^: sed leges
Angliae semel manumissu^, semper liberum iudica^t, gratum and ingratu^. Alij
quoque sunt casus huiuscemodi non pauci, quos iam, studio breuitatis,
praetereo. Et neque in hijs duobus casibus, praedictarum legum praesta^tias,
ego iam describo, cum no^ magnae sint ind^ginis, eorum qualitates, nec diffido,
ingenij tuisolertiam eas sufficienter posse rimari.

The Prince regards not the cases now rehearsed Chap. 47.
NO nor it booteth not, good Chancellor herein much to tarry, quod the
Prince. For though in England, as well open, as privy thieves, are commonly put
to death, yet cease they not there from stealing, as though they had no fear
of so great a punishment. How much less then would they withholde their
hands from theft, if they foresawe once that the punishment were mitigated?
And God forbid, that he, which once has escaped miserable servitude, should
ever after tremble and quake at the threatenings of bondage, specially under the
color of ingratitude or unkindness, seeing the kinds of ingratitude are so
many, that they can skante well be numbered: and man's nature in the cause of
liberty of freedom, more then in other causes, requires favor. Wherefore at
this time, good Chancellor, I beseech you heartily meddle no more with the
examination of any such cases. But now explane and open unto me, why the laws
of England, being so good, so fruitful, and so commodious, are not taught in
the Universities, as the Civil and Canon laws are: and why in the same, none
are commenced Bachelors and Doctors, as in other faculties and sciences it is
accustomed.

PRinceps. Nec ex pedit Ca^cellarie, in hijs multu^ sudare: qa, licet in Anglia
^ures clandestini and manifesti passim morte plectantur, non cessant ipsi
ibide^ omnino praedari, ac si paena^ tantam illi minime formidarent. Quanto
tunc minus, se abstinerent a crimine si paenam praeuiderent mitiorem? Et absit,
a seruitute semel euasum, semper deinde sub minis tremere seruitutis, maxim
ingratitudinis color, cum ingratitudinum species, vix po terint, prae
multitudine, numerari, and humana natura, in libertatis causa fauorem semper,
magis, quam in causis alijs, deprecetur. Sed iam, Cancellarie, obnixe te
imploro, vt amodo amissa plurium casuu^ huiusmodi examinatione, mihi edi cas,
quare leges Angliae, tam bonae, frugi, and optabiles, in vniuersitatibus non
docentur, vt Ciuiles similiter and Canonu^ leges: and quare in e^sdem, non
datur Baccalariatus and Doctoratus gradus, vt in alijs facultatibus and
scientijs est dari consuetum.

Here the Chancellor shows, why, the Laws of England are not taught in
Universities. Chap. 48.
IN the Uniuersities of England, quod the Chancellor, sciences are not taught
but in the Latin tongue: And the laws of that land are to be learned in iij.
several tongues: to wit, in the English tongue, the French tongue, and the
Latin tongue. In the english tongue, because ye law is most used, and longest
continued amongst the Englishmen. In the French tongue, because that after the
French men under William the Conqueror of England had obtained ye la^d, they
suffered not their men of law to plead their causes, but in ye tongue which they
knew, and so do all the men of law in France, yea in the court of Parliament
there. Likewise the Frenchemen, after their coming into England, received not
the acco^pts of their revenues but in their own language, lest they should be
deceived therein, Neither had they delight to hunt, and to exercise other
sports and pastimes, as dice play, and the hand ball, but in their own proper
tongue. Wherefore the Englishmen by much using of their company, grew in such
a per^ectnesse of the same language, that at this day in such plays and
accounts they use the French tongue, And they were wont to plead in French
till by force of a certain Statute, that manner was much restrained, But it
could never hitherto, be wholly abolished, as well by reason of certain
Terms, which pleaders do more properly express in French, then in English,
as also for that declarations upon original writts cannot be pronounced so
agreeably to the nature of those writtes, as in French, And under the same
speech the forms of such declarations are learned. Moreover, all pleadings,
arguings, and judgments passed in the kings court, and entered into books,
for the instruction of them that shall come after, are ever more reported in the
French tongue. Many Statutes also of that realm are written in French. Whereof
it happens that the common speech, now used in France, agrees not, nor is not
like the French used among the Lawyers of England, but it is by a certain
rudeness of the common people corrupt. Which corruption of speech chances not
in the French that is used in England, for so much as the speech is there oftener
written then spoken. Now in the third of the said three tongues, which is the
Latin tongue, are written all Writs original and iuditial: and likewise all the Records of plees in the Kings Courts, with certain Statuts also.
Wherefore, while the Laws of England are learned in these three tongues, they
cannot conveniently be taught or studied in the universities, where only the
Latin tongue is exercised. Notwithstanding the same Laws are taught and
learned, in a certain place of public or common study, more convenient and
apt for attayning to the knowledge of the^ the^ any other university. For this
place of study is situate nie to the Kings courts, where ye same laws are
pleaded and argued, and judgments by ye same given by Judges, men of gravity,
ancient in years, perfect and graduate in the same laws. Wherefore, every day
in court, ye students in those Laws resort by great numbers into those courts
wherein the same Laws are read and taught as it were in common schools. This
place of study is set between the place of the said Courts, and the City of
London, which of all things necessary is the plentifullest of all the Cities
and towns of the Realm. So that the said place of study is not situate
within the City, where the confluence of people might disturb the quietness
of ye students, but somewhat several in the suburbs of the same City, and
nigher to the said Courts, that the students may dayelye a^ their pleasure
have access and recourse thither with out weariness.

CAncellarius, In Vniuersitatibus Angliae, non docentur scientiae nisi in
Latina lingua: Et leges terrae illius in triplici lingua addiscuntur:
videlicet, Anglica, Gallica, and Latina. Anglica, quia inter Anglos lex illa

Here he declares the disposition of the general study of the Laws of
England, and that the same in number of students passes certain universities.
Cap. 49.
BUt to the intent, most excellent Prince, ye may conceive a form and an image
of this study, as I am able, I will describe it unto you. For there be in it
ten lesser houses or Innes, and sometimes more, which are called Innes of the
Chancerie, And to every one of them, belongs an hundred students at the
least, and to some of them a much greater number, though they be not ever al
together in ye same. These students, for the most part of them, are young men,
learning or studying the originals, and as it were the elements of the Law,
who profiting therein, as they grow to ripeness, so are they admitted into the
greater Innes of the same study, called the Innes of Court. Of the which
greater Inns there are four in number. And to the least of them belongs, in
form above mentioned, two hundredth Students or there aboutes.

For in these greater Innes, there can no Student be mayntayned for less
expenses by the year, then twenty Marks, And if he have a servant to wait
upon him, as most of them have, then so much the greater will his charges be.
Now, by reason of this charges, the children only of Noble men do study the
Laws in those Innes. For the poor and common sort of the people, are not able
to bear so great charges for the exhibition of their Children. And Merchant
men can seldom find in their hearts to hinder their merchandise with so great
yearly expenses.

And thus it falls out that there is scant any man found within the Realm
skillful and cunning in the laws, except he be a Gentleman borne and come of a
Noble stock. Wherefore they more, the^ any other kind of men have a special
regard to their Nobility, and to the preservation of their honor and fame. And
to speak uprightly, there is in these greater Innes, yea, and in the lesser to,
beside the study of the laws, as it were an university or school of all
commendable qualities requisite for Noblemen. There they learn to sing, and to
exercise themselves in all kind of harmony. There also they practice dancing,
and other Noble men's pastimes, as they use to do, which are brought up in the
Kings house: On the working days, most of them apply themselves to the study
of the Law, And on the holy days to the study of holy Scripture: and out of
the time of Divine service, to the reading of Cronicles. For there indeed are
virtues studied, and vices exiled. So that, for the endowment of virtue, and
abandoning of vice, Knights and Barons, with other States and Noble men of the
Realm, place their Children in those Innes, though they desire not to have
them learned in the Laws, nor to live by the practice thereof, but only upon
their fathers allowance. Scant at any time is there heard amongst them any
sedition, chiding or grudging, And yet the offenders are punished with none
other pain, but only to be amooued from the company of their fellowship.
Which punishment they do more fear, then other criminal offenders do fear
imprisonment and yrons: For he that is once expelled from any of those
fellowships, is never received to be a fellow in any of the other
felowshippes, And so by this means there is continual peace: and their
demeanor is like the behavior of such as are coupled together in perfect
amity. But, after what manner and sort the laws are learned in those Innes,
thereof here to make rehearsal, it is not needful, for so much as it is not
for your estat, most noble Prince, to put the same in ure. Yet know ye this,
that it is pleasant and delectable, and in any wise expedient, for the learning
of the Law, and worthy with all affection to be embraced. But one thing there
is, yt I would have you to know, yt neither at Orleance, where as well the
Cano^, as ye Civil laws, are taught, and whether, out of many countries,
scholars do repair, nor at Angeo, or at Cane, or any university of France (
Paris only excepted) are found so many students past childehoode* as in this
place of study, notwithstanding that all the stude^ts there are English borne.

SEd, vt tibi constet princeps huius studij ^orma and imago, illam, vt val^o,
iam describa^. Sunt namque in eo, december hospitia minora, and qua^doque vero
plura quae nomina^tur hospitia Cancellariae ad quoru^ quoth libet pertine^t ce^tu^
stude^tes ad minus, and ad aliqua eoru^ mayor in multo numerus, licet no^ oe^s
se^per in eis fimul co^ueniant. Stude^tes etenim isti, proeoru^ part^maiori,
iuuenes sunt, originalia, and, quasi legis eleme^ta addisce^tes, qui in illis
proficie^tes, vt ipsi maturescunt, ad maiora hospitia studij illius, quae
hospita curiae appellantur, assumuntur, Quoru^ maiorum, quatuor sunt in numero,
and ad minimum eoru^ pertinent in forma praenotata, ducenti stude^tes aut
prope. In hijs enim maiori bus hospitijs, nequa qua^ potest studens aliquis
suste^tari minoribus expensis in anno, quam octoginta scutoru^, and si
seruientem sibi ipse ibidem habuerit, vt eorum habet pluralitas, tanto tunc
maiores ipse sustinebit expe^sas. Occasion vero su^ptuu^ hm^di, ipsi nobiliu^
filij ta^tu^ in hospitijs illis leges addiscunt. Cu^ pauperes and vulgares, pro
filiorum suorum exhibitione, tantos sumptus nequeant sufferre. Et mercatores
raro cupiant tantis oneribus annuis attenuare merca^disas suas. Quo fit vt vix
doctus in legibus illis reperiatur in regno qui non sit nobilis, and de
nobilium genere egressus. Vnde magis alijs consimilis status hominibus, ipsi
nobilitatem curant and conseruatione^ honoris and famae suae. In his reuera
hospiciijs maioribus, etiam and minoribus, vl^ra studium legu^, est quasi
gimnasiu^ omnium moru^, qui nobiles decent. Ibi cantare ipsi addiscunt
similiter and se exercent in omni genere harmoniae. Ibi etiam tripudiare, ac

and in festiualibus sacrae scripturae, and cronicoru^ lectioni, post diuina
obsequia, se confert. Ibi quippe disciplina virtutum est and vitiorum omnium
exiliu^. Ita vt propter virtutis acquisitionem, vitij etiam fugam, milites,
barons alij quoque magnates and nobiles Regni, in hospitijs illis ponunt
filios suos, quamuis non gliscant eos legum imbui disciplina, nec ei^us

hofpitijs, hic exprimere non expedit, cum tibi, princeps, ea^ experiri no^
liceat. Scito tamen, quoth delectabilis ipsa est and omni modo expedie^s legis
illius disciplinae, omni quoque affectione digna. Vnum tamen te scire desidero,
quoth neque Aurelianis vbi tam Canones addiscuntur, quam ciuiles leges, and quo, a
qua^pluribus regionibus confluunt scolares, neque Andaginis, aut in Cadomo,
aliaue vniuersitate Franciae, praeterquam solu^ Parisijs, reperiuntur tot

BUt for so much as you desire to know, most gracious Prince, for what cause the
degrees of Bachelars and Doctors are not given in the Laws of England as they
are accustomably given in both Laws within universities, your Majesty shall
understand, that, though there degrees are not given in the Laws of England,
yet there is given in them not a degree only, but also a state no less
worshipful and solemn, then the degree of doctors: which (...) called the
degree of a Serieant at Law. And it is given under the manner and form
following. The Lord chief Justice, of the Common Bench, by the counsel and
assent of all the Justices, uses, as often as he thinks good, to chose seven
or eight of the discreetest persons, that in the foresaid general study have
most profited in the Laws, and which to the same Justices are thought to be
of best disposition, and their names he presents to the Lord Chancellor of
England in writing, Who incontinent, by virtue of the Kings Writ, shall charge
every of the persons elect, to be before the king at a day by him assigned, to
take upon him the state and degree of a serieant at Law, under a great
penalty in every of the said Writtes lymitted: On the which day, every one
of them appearing, shall be sworn upon the holy Gospel of GOD, to be
ready, at the day and place then to be appointed, to receive the state and
degree aforesaid, and that he the same day shall give Gold according to the
custom in that behalf used. How be it, how and after what sort, every of
the said persons shall that day demean himself, and also the form and
manner, how, that state and degree shall be given and received, for so much
as the same can not so briefly be written, as to the shortness of this work
is requisite therefore at this time, I will leave these points untouched. And
yet I have declared the same to you ere now by way of talk. But this you must
understand, that when the day appointed is come, those elect persons among
other solemnities, must keep a great dinner, like to the feast of a Kings
Coronation, which shall continue and last by the space of seven days, And
none of those elect persons shall defray the charges growing to him about the
coasts of this solemnity, with less expenses, then the sum of four
hundred marks, so that the expenses, which eight men, so elect, shall then
bestow, will surmount to the sum of three thousand and two hundred Marks: Of
the which expenses, one parcel shall be this. Every of them shall give ringes
of gold, to the value of forty pounds sterling at the least: And your
Chancellor well remembers, that at what time he received this state and
degree, the rings which he then gave, stood him in fifty pounds. For, every
such Serieant, at the day of his creation, uses to give unto every Prince,
Duke, and Archbishop, being present at that solemnity, and to the Lord
Chancellor, and Lord Treasorer of England, a ring of the value of xxvi.
shillings viij. pence. And to every Earl and Bishop being likewise present,
and also to ye Lord Privy seal, to both the Lords chief Justices, and to the
Lord chief Baron of the kings Eschequer, a ring of the value of xx. shillings.
And to every Lord Baron of the Parliament, and to every Abot and notable
Prelate, and worshipful Knight, being then present, and also to the Master of
the Rolls, and to every Justice, a ring, of the value of a Mark, And likewise
to every Baron of the Exchequer, to the Chamberlaines, and to all the officers
and notable men serving in the Kings courts, rings of a smaller price, but
agreeable to their estats, to whom they are given. Insomuch that there shall not
be a Clerk, specially in the court of ye common bench, but he shall receive a
ring convenient for his degree. And besides these, they give diverse rings to
other of their friends. They give also liueries of cloth of one suit or color
in great abundance, not only to their household meany, but also to their other
friends and acquaintance, which, during the time of the foresaid solemnity,
shall atte^d and wait upon them. Wherefore* though in the Uniuersities, they,
that are promoted to the d^gree of Doctors, do sustain no small charges at the
time of their commenceme^t as in giving of bonets and other rich gifts, yet
they give no gold, nor do bestow any other gifts or costs like unto these
expenses. Nether in any country of the world, is there any special degree
given in the Laws of the same Land, but only in the realm of England.
Neither is there any man of Law through out the universal world, which, by
reason of his office or profession, gains so much as one of these Serieants.
No man also, be he never so cunning and skilful in the laws of the realm,
shall be exalted to the office and dignity of a Justice in the court of plees
before the king, or in the court of the comen bench, which are the chief
ordinary Courts of the same realm, unless he be first promoted to the
state and degree of a Serieant at Law. Neither shall any man, but only such a
Serieant, plead in the Court of the Common bench, where al real actions are
pleaded. Wherefore to this state and degree has no man been hitherto
admitted, except he has first continued by the space of sixteen years in the
said general study of the law, and in token or sign, that all Justices are
thus graduat, every of them always, while he sits in the Kings court,
wears a white Quoife of silk: which is the principal and chief insignement
of habit, wherewith Serieants at law in their creation, are decked: and
neither the Justice, nor yet the Serieant, shall ever put of the quoi^e, no not
in the kings presence, though he be in talk with his majesty's highness.
Wherefore, most noble Prince, you cannot hereafter doubt, but ye these laws,
which so singularly above the Civil laws, yea and above ye laws of al other
Realms are honored, and with so solemn a state of such, as are learned
therein, and do profess ye same, are worshipped must needs be precious, noble
and high, and of great excellency, and of special knowledge and virtue.

After what manner, a Justice is created, and of his habit and conversation.

BUt to the intent the state of Justices as well as the Serieants at Law, may
be known to your grace, as I can, I will describe unto you their form and
office. In the common bench there are customable v. Justices or six at ye most.
And i^ the Kings bench iiij. or five. And as often as the place of any of them by
death or otherwise, is void, the King uses to choose one of the Serieaunts at
Law, and him by his Letters Patents, to ordain a Justice, in the place of the
Judge so seasing, And then the Lord Chancellor of England shall enter into the
Court, where the Justice is so lacking, bringing with him those letters
patents, and sitting in the midst of the Justices causes the Serieant so
elect to be brought in, to whom in the open Court he notifieth the Kings
pleasure touching the office of the Justice then void and causes the foresaid
letters to be openly read. Which done, the Master of the Rolls shall read
before the same elect person, the oath yt he shall take, which when he has
sworn upon the holy Gospel of God, the Lord Chancellor shall deliver unto him
the Kings letters aforesaid, And the Lord Chief Justice of the Court shall
assign unto him a place in the same, where he shall then place him, and that
place shall he afterward keep. Yet you must know, most noble Prince, that
this Justice shall then among other things, swear, that he shall
indifferently minister Justice to all men, as well foes as friends, that shall
have any suite or plea before him, And this shall he not forbear to do though
the king by his letters, or by express word of mouth, would command the
contrary. He shall also swear yt from ye time forward, he shall not receive or
take any fee, or pe^sio^, or livery of any man but of the King only, nor any
gift, reward or bribe of any man having suite or Plea before him, saving meat
and drink, which shall be of no great value. You shall also know, that a
Justice, thus made, shall not be at the charges of any dinner or solemnity, or
any other costs at the time when he takes upon him his Office and dignity,
For So Much as this is no degree in the faculty of the Law, but an office only
and a room of authority, to continue during the kings pleasure, Howbeit the
habit of his raiment, he shall from time to time forward, in some points
change, but not all the ensignements thereof. For being a Serieaunt at Law,
he was clothed in a long roabe priest like, with a Furred Cape about his
shoulders, and thereupon a Hood^ with two Labels such as Doctors of the Laws
use to wear in certain Uniuersities, with the above described Quoyfe. But
being once made a Justice, in steed of his Hoode, he shall wear a Cloak
cloased upon his right shoulder, all the other Ornaments of a Serieaunt still
remaining: saving that a Justice shall wear no partiae colored Vesture as a
Serieaunt may, And his Cape is Furred with none other then Meneuer, whereas the
Sereiaunts Cape is ever Furred with white Lamb. And this Habit I would wish
your Grace to bring into high estimation, when it shall be in your power, for
the worship of the state of the Law, and the honor of your Realm.
Furthermore, I would ye should know, that the Justices of England sit not in
the kings courts above iij hours in a day, that is to say, from viij. of the
clock in the forenoone til xj. complete, For in the afternoones, those courts
are not holde^ or kept. But the Suitors then resort to the perusing of their
writtings, and elsewhere consulting with the Serieants at law, and other their
Cou^saylors* Wherefore the Justices, after they have taken their refection, do
pass and bestow all the residue of the day in the study of the laws, in
reading of holy Scripture, and using other kind of contemplation at their
pleasure, So that their life may seem more contemplative then active. And thus
do they lead a quiet life, discharged of all worldly cares and troubles: And
it has never been known, that any of them has been corrupt with gifts or
bribes. Whereupon we have seen this kind of grace following, that skant any
of them dies without issue, which unto just men is a token of the great and
peculiar blessing of God, And in mine opinion it is to be judged for no small
point of the bountiful goodness of God, that out of the generation of Judges
there have hitherto sprung up more States and Peeers of the Realm, then out of
any other state of men: which by their own wit and policy have aspired unto
great wealth, nobility and honor. Yea though the state of Merchants surmount
the number of Judges by many thousands, being men of such singular wealth, that
among them commonly there be such, as one of them in riches passes all the
Justices of the Realm. For this cannot be ascribed unto Fortune, which is
nothing, But it is to be attributed (as I take it) only to the blessing of
God. For So Much as by his prophet he says, that the generation of righteous men
shall be blessed. And ye prophet in an other place, speking of just men, says,
that their children shall be in blessing. Wherefore, O most magnifice^t Prince,
be you in love with Justice, which thus enricheth, exalts to honor and
adua^ceth to perpetuity the children of the^ that have her in veneration. And
be you a zealous lover of the Law, the very welspring of justice, that by you it
may be said yt it is written of the righteous, And their seed shall remain
for ever.

The prince finds fault with delays, that are made in the Kings Courts.
Chap. 52.
PRinceps. Vnu^ ia^ solu^ super est, Ca^cellarie, declara^du^: quo paru^per
adhuc fluctuat, inquietat^ quoque men's mea, In quo, fi ea^ solidaueris, no^
amplius te quae stionibus fatigabo. Dilationes inge^tes, vt asseritur,
patiuntur leges Angliae in processibus suis plusquam leges aliarum nationum quoth
pe^e^tibus, nedu^ iuris sui prolatio est, sed and sumptuu^ qua^doque
importabile onus, and maxim in actionibus illis in quibus da^na petentibus non
redduntur.

THere remains now but one thing, good Chancellor, quod the Prince, to be
declared, wherwt my mind so^ewhat yet wauereth and is disquieted, wherein* if
you stay and satisfy me, I will trouble you with no mo questions. The Laws of
England as the report goes, suffer great delays in their processes, more then
the Laws of other Nations, which unto suitors is not only a hinderance of
their right, but also many times an importable burden of charges, and chiefly
in those actions, wherein damages are not allowed

Delays, that happen in the Kings Courts are necessary and reasonable. Chap.
53.
IN actions personal, quod the Chancellor out of Cities and Towns of
merchandise, where the manner of proceeding is according to the customs and
liberties of the same, there the proceedings are ordinary. And though they
suffer great delays, yet they be not excessive. But in the same Cities and
Towns chiefly when any urgent cause so requires, there is quick dispatch
made, like as in other parts of the world, and yet not with such hot haste as
in some other places, that the party be thereby endammaged. Again, in
actions real, the proceedings are very slow, almost in all parts of the world,
but in England, somewhat speedier. For, within the Realm of France, in the
highest Court there, which is called the Court of Parliament, there be
certain processes that have hanged there avoue thirty years. And I know yt a
cause of apeale, which in ye court between Rich: Heron an English mercha^t, and
other mercha^t me^, for a transgression made, has bin debated within ye
jurisdiction of that court, has already hanged by the space of x. years, And
it is not yet like, that it can be decided wtin other x. years While I was
lately abiding in Paris, mine host showed me his process in writing, which in
ye court of Parliam^t there he had then followed full 8 years, for iiij. s^.
re^t, which in our money makes not above viii. d. and yet he was in no hope to
obtain judgment in 8. years more: and I know other cases there, like unto these,
So that ye Laws of England, as seems to me, cause not so great delays, as
do the Laws of that country. But to speak uprightly it is necessary that
delays he had in the processes of al nations, so that the same be not too
much excessive. For by reason thereof, the parties, and chifely the party
defendant, do oftentimes provide themselves of good defenses, and also of
counsels, which else they should lack. And in judgments, there is never so
great danger toward, as when process goes forward with over much haste. For I
saw once in the City of Salisburie, before a certain Judge, at a jail
delivery there, with the Clerk of the assizes, a woman attainted and burned
for the death of her husband within a year, after he was slain, In ye which
case, it was in the Judges power to have repriued, or respected ye woman's
araignment till the end of the year, And about a year after that, I saw one of
ye servants of the slain man, convict, before the same Justice, of the death
of the same his master. Who then openly confessed, that he himself alone slew
his master, and that his master his wife, which before was burned, was
altogether innocent of his death. And he for the same was drawn and hanged.
And still, even at ye point of death, he lamented the woman burned, as one
clear from that offense. O wha^ perplexity and remorse of conscience it is to
be thought, yt this so hasty a Justice had of this deed, wc might justly have
stayed ye process? He himself (alas) often confessed unto me yt he should never
during his life be able to clear his conscience of this fact: For many times,
in deliberations, judgments grow to ripenes: but in ouerhasty process, never.
Wherefore ye laws of England admit essoyne, and so do no other laws of all the
world. Are not vouchings to warrant right profitable, are not the aides of them
profitable to whom the reuersion of tenements brought in plea belongs, and
which have the evidences of ye same. Are not also the aides of copertners
profitable, which shall pay according to the rate of a tenement, allotted to
their copertner by force of the Law euicted from him, And yet all these are
delays, as you, most noble Prince, by my talk at other times do well know:
and the like delays to these do no other Laws admit, neither do the Laws
of England admit trifeling and unfruitful delays. And if any such fond
delays should be used they may at every Parliament be cut away. Yea and
other Laws used in the same Realm, when in any point they begin to halt, they
may at every Parliament be reformed. Wherefore, it may well be concluded,
that all the Laws of that Realm are right good, either in deed, or in
possibility, So that if they be not presently good, they may easily be
reduced to the present perfection of goodness. To the performance whereof, as
often as equity so requires, every king there is bound by an oath solemnly
taken at the time of his Coronation.

I Have well and evidently perceived, quod the prince by the process of your
talk good Cha^cellor, that those Laws are not only good but also of most
perfect and excellent goodness. And if any of the^ have need to be amended, yt
may quickly be done, as ye forms and orders of ye Parliame^ts there do plainly
prove. Wherefore ye realm is ever, really, or potentially, governed by most
excellent and most worthy Laws, and I doubt not, but that your instructions,
in this our talk, shall be profitable for the kings of England, which hereafter
shall be: so that they have no pleasure in governing by unpleasant laws. For
the vnhansomnes of the tool or instrument wearieth the workman: and a blu^t
pike or a dull sword makes a cowardly soldiour. But like as a soldiour is
encoraged to fight, not only, when he has handsome and fit weopo^s in a
redines, but also much more, when he is expert and skilful in warlike acts,
according to ye saying of Vegetius in his book of chiualry, ye knowledge and
cunning in Martial feats ministers boldness in fighting (for no man fears to
do that, which he trusts he has well learned) in like manner every King
has a fervent zeal, and earnest desire to the maintenance of Justice, not
only knowing the Laws, whereby that must be done, to be most just, but also
being skilful in the form and nature of the same: Whereof it shall suffice the
Prince to have only an universal, a superficial and a confuse knowledge, ye
discreet and determinate perfectnes, and deep understanding of ye same, being
left to his Judges. So also, ought all princes to be well seen in the holy
scriptures of God, as says Vincentius Beluacensis in his book of the Moral
institution of Princes, Forasmuch as the Scripture above mentioned says, ye
vain are all they, in whom is not the knowledge of God, and for that in the
sixteenth Chapter of the Proverbs it is thus written: Let prophecy, or the
Word of God, be in the lips of the King, and then his mouth shall not go wrong
in judgment. And yet is not a King bound to have profound knowledge and
determinate understanding in the holy Scriptures as it becomes a professor
of Divinity: For it shall be enough for him, superficially to taste the
sentences thereof, as also of his Laws. Thus did Charles the great, Jews his
son, and Robert sometime King of France who wrote this sequence. (Sancti
Spiritus adsit nobis gratia) and diverse other Princes, as the foresaid
Vincentius in the fifteenth Chapter of his Book aforesaid plainly shows.
Wherefore the Doctors of the Laws do say, that an Emperor bears all his
Laws in the box of his breaste: not for that he knows all the Laws really
and in deed, but for that he understands the Principles of them, likewise
their form and their nature, in which respect he is judged to be skillful in
all his Laws, Which also he may altar, change, and repeal: So that in him are
potentially all his laws, as Eve was in Adam before she was made. But now,
good Cancellour, seeing I perceive my self sufficiently persuaded to the study
of the laws of England, which thing in the beginning of this work you
promised to perform, I will no longer trouble you in this behalf, But thus I
instantly desire you that ye will instruct me in the principles of the Law,
as you once began to do: and that you will teach me to know and understand
the form and nature thereof, For this Law, shall be evermore peculiar to me
among all other Laws of the world, among the which I see it shine, as Lucifer
among the Stars. And for so much as I doubt not but your intent, where by you
were moved to this conference, is fully satisfied: both time and reason
requires, that we make an end of our talk, yielding therefore lauds and
thanks to him, which began, furthered, and has finished the same, Whom we
call Alpha and O. who also be praised of every living creature. Amen.

FINIS.
The Table.
AN Introductio^n to the matter. Fol. 3 The Chancellor moves the Prince to
the knoweledge of the Law. 4 The Princes reply to the motion 7 The Chancellor
fortifieth his assertion. 8 The Chancellor proves that a Prince by the Law
may be made happy and blessed. 10 Ignorance of the Law causes contempt
thereof. 14 The Chancellor briefly repeateth the effect of his persuasion. 17
The Prince yields himself to the study of the Laws, though he be yet
disquieted with certain doubts. 19 So much knowledge as is necessary for a
Prince is soon had. 20 A King whose government is politic cannot change his
Laws. 25 The Prince demands a question. 27 The answer is omitted for that in
an other work it is handled at large. 28 How kingdoms ruled by royal
government only first began. 28 How kingdoms of politic governance were
begun. 30 The Prince compendiously abridgeth all tha^ the Chancellor before
has discoursed at large. 33 All Laws are the Law of Nature, Customs, or
Statutes. 36 The Law of Nature in all Countries is one. 37 The Customs of
England are of most ancient antiquity, practiced and received of five
several Nations from one to another by succession. 38 With what gravity
Statutes are made in England. 39 A mean to know the diversity between the
Civil Laws and the Laws of England. 41 The first case wherein the Civil
Laws and the Laws of England differ. 42 Inconveniences that comes of that
Law, which no otherwise then by witnesses admits trialls. 43 Of the
cruelty of Rackings. 46 The Civil Law often fails in doing of Justice. 50
How Counties are divided and Sheriffs chosen. 51 How Iurers must be chosen and
sworn. 54 How Iurers ought to be informed by evidences and witnesses. 57 How
causes criminal, are determined in England. 61 The Prince grants the Laws
of England to be more commodious for the subjects, then the Civil Laws in the
case disputed. 63 Why Enquests are not made by Iuries of xij. men in other
Realms, as well as in England. 65 The Prince commends the Laws of England of
their proceeding by Iuries 69 The Prince doubts, whether this proceeding by
Iuries be repugnant to Gods Law, or not. 70 That the proceeding by a Jury, is
not repugnant to the Law of God. 72 Why certain Kings of England have had no
delight in their own Laws. 76 The Chancellor opens the cause which the
Prince demands. 77 The inconveniences that happen in the Realm of France,
through regal government alone. 79 The commodities that proceed of the joint
government politic and regal, in the Realm of England 83 A comparison of
the worthynesse of both the regiments. 86 The Prince breaks the Chancellor of
his tale. 89 The second case, wherein the Civil Laws, and the Laws of
England, disagree in their judgments. 89 Special causes why base borne
children are not legittimate in England by matrimony ensuing. 93 The Prince
allows the Law, which does not ligittimate children borne before matrimony.
98 The third case wherein the Laws aforesaid disagre. 98 The Prince approves
the Law, whereby the issue follows not the womb. 103 The fourth case
wherein the said Laws vary. 104 The Prince commends the education of Noble
men's children being Orphans. 106 Other cases wherein the foresaid Laws
differ. 108 The prince regards not the cases last rehearsed. 109 The
Chancellor shows why the laws of England are not taught in the
Universities. 110 The disposition of the general study of the Laws of
England, and that the same in number passes certain Universities. 113 Of the
estate and degree of a Serieant at Law, and how he is created. 116 After what
manner a Justice is created, and of his habit and conversation 121 The Prince
finds fault with delays that are made in the Kings Courts. 125 That delays
which happen in the Kings Court are necessary and reasonable. 129 That the
Laws of England are right good, the knowledge whereof is expedient for kings,
and tha^ it shall suffice them to have but a superficial knowledge of the
same. 129

Notes upon Sir JOHN FORTESCVE Knight, L. Chief Justice of England, De
laudibus legum Angliae.
Ad CAP. III.
1 AVctore causaruns.] Questionless he meant the author of the little book De
causis, put in some latin editions at the end of Aristotle's works with some
other ridiculously attributed to Aristotle. There are, who think it to be done
by Alpharabius, others by Auempace, others by Proclus. It was turned out of
Hebrew into Latin, but is not extant in Aristotle's language. It Is ancient, but
clearly beneath the age of Aristotle. In proposit. 1. the substance is of what
he cites.

Ad CAP. VIII.
2 APprenticios.] From Apprendre. i. to learn, comes Apprentice de la ley;
which will denote as much as Discipulus applied by Justinian to somewhat a like
degree in his law. For after he had reckoned his Dupondij or Iustiniani novi
(that is, students of two years standing) his Papinianists (students of three
years) his Lytae (those of four years) and his prolytae (for them of five) to
whom the reading of the whole course of that law and an able understanding was
imputed, he then, comprehending the prolytae and the rest laboring to that
degree, adds; Discipuliigitur omnibus eis legitimis arcanis reseratis, nihil
habeant absconditum, but that they might afterward be Iustitiae satellites and
iudiciorum optimi tam athletae quam gubernatores, in omni loco aeueque
faelices. So he writes C. tit. de veteri iure enucl. l. 1. Deo auctore.. 6.
The antientest mention of an Apprentice in this sens which our published books
have is in 1. Ed. 3. fol. 17. a pl. 3. But in the monuments of Parliament of 20.
Ed. 1. extant in the Tower, this testimony is of them: De Atturnatis and
Apprenticijs, D. Rex iniunxit Iohanni de Mettingham and sociis suis, quod ipsi
per eorum discretiones provideant and ordinent certum numerum de quolibet
co^itatu de melioribus and legalioribus and libentius addiscentibus secu^du^
quod intellexerint quod Curiae suae and populo de regno melius valere poterit
and maius co^modu^ fuerit, and quod ipsi quos ad hoc elegerint Curia^
sequantur, and alij non. Et videtur Regi and eius consilio quod septies-viginti
sufficere poterint etc. Apponant tamen praefati Iustitiarij plures si viderint
esse faciendum vel numerum anticipent, and de alijs remanentibus fiat secundu^
discretionem Iustitiariorum. Mention is of them also in Fleta lib. 2. cap. 37.
Part of that of 20. Ed. 1. is transcribed in the Epistle of the 9. reports,
where more is out of antiquity touching these Apprentices. The name was used
for Practisers, and Apprenticij ad Barros are Barristers in the ridiculous
verses of Andrew Horn before his Mirror aux Justices. These are they, Hanc
legum summa^, si quis vult mira tueri,
Perlegat, and sapiens si vult orator haberi;
Hoc Apprenticijs ad Barros ebore munus,
Gratum iuridicis vtile mittit opus
Horn mihi cognome^, Andreas est mihi nome^.

This Horn lived about Ed. 2. His certain age I yet know not. The verses I
transcribed out of an ancient copy of him, extant in Bennet College Library
in Cambridge, and written, as it seems by the hand, about Edw. 3. or Rich. the
seconds time.

3 Proprio ore nullus Regam Angliae.] Yet certainly the Kings themselves often
sat in court (in the Kings Bench:) and in the rolls of Charters under King
John and the time near him, often occur grants that such or such English
should not be impleded or put to answer nisi cora^ nobis vel capitali
iustitia nostra, and to Normans nisi coram nobis vel capitali senescallo
nostro. For example, in Rot. Chart. 1. Reg. Ioh. Chart. 171. memb. 28. the king
gives to one Jacob a Jew of London and a priest of the Jews, presbyteratum
omnium Iudaeorum totius Angliae for life, and the patent has in it, prohibemus
etia^ ne de aliquo ad se pertinente ponatur in placitum nisi cora^ nobis aut
coram capitali Iustitia nostra sicut Charta Regis Richardi fratris mei
testatur. Here coram capitali Iustitia is divided from coram Rege; the last
signifying before the Kings person; although now pleas held in the Kings Bench
before the successor of the Capitalis iustitia, are entered coram Rege, and
some rolls (as of 44. Hen. 3.) have placita cora^ Domino Rege de Tempore
Hugonis Bigod Iustitiarij Angliae, and also in the same bundle Placita coram
Hugone le Bigod Iustitiario Angliae. And Bracton lib. 3. tract. de Actionibus
cap. 5. si actiones criminales sint, in curia Domini Regis debent terminari,
and hoc coram ipso Rege si tangant personam suam. and in 2. Ed. 4. the king
sat in person.

in the Treasuries of Records. Neither is that of Godfrey of Malmesburie
unnecessary to be here rememberd. He relates that when William 11 was offended
with Malcolm 111. of Scotland, that he would not secundum iudicium Baronum
suorum in curia sua rectitudinem Regibus Angloru^ facere, the Scottish King id
agere nisi in regnorum suorum confinijs vbi reges Scotorum erant soliti
rectitudinem facere regibus Anglorum, and secundum iudicium primatum vtriusque
regni nullo modo voluit, and sic impacati ad inuicem discesserunt. He places
this in 7. Willielmi 2. When this Godfrey lived I know not, his Annals begin
with the Saxons, and end in 29. Hen. 1. He has much of Northern matters, and
the same that is in Roger of Houede^. often and this very passage also is in
Houeden, page 265.

Ad CAP XVII.
5 ALiqui Regum] But questionless the Saxons made a mixture of the British
customs with their own; the Danes with old British, the Saxon and their own;
and the Normans the like. The old laws of the Saxons mention the Danish law (
Danelage) the Mercian law ( Mercenlage) and the Westsaxon law ( Westsaxonlage)
of which also some Counties were governed by one, some by another. All these
being considered by William 1. comparing them with the laws of Norway (which he
most of all affected, mainly, as I think, because by them a Bastard of a
Concubine, as himself was, had equal enheritance with the most legitimat
son. You may see for it Roger de Houeden fol. 347. and 425.) he quasdam
reprobauit (as the words of Geruase of Tilburie in his Dialogue de Scaccario
are) quasdam autem approbans illis transmarinas Neustriae leges quae ad regni
pacem tue^dam efficacissime videba^tur adiecit, but so indeed, that such laws
as he in writing allowd, are, by a denomination from the greater part called
bonae and adprobatae antiquae regni leges by Matthew. Paris in his Ms. life of
Fretherique Abbot of S. Albons, and leges Edwardi Regis quae prius inuentae
sunt and constitutae in tempore Adgari aui sui by Roger of Houeden, and leges
aequissimi Regis Edwardi by Ingulphus Abbot of Crowland, who lived under the
Conqueror, and brought a copy of them from London to his Abbey, as he
remembers in his printed story. And in a Ms. copy, communicated to me,
among diverse other, by that living Treasure of Antiquity and most exquisit
monuments, my noble and much deserving friend Sir Robert Cotton, and continued
by Peter of Blois, after that which is in the print, succeed those laws of
William 1. there spoken of with this title in broken french, Ces sont leis and
les Cus^umes qui li Reys William gra^tast a tutle puple de Engleterre apres la
conquest de la terre ice les meismes que le Reys Edward sun Cousin tint deuant
lut. Ceo est a sauoir, pais a saint Egglise etc. the context of them throughout
being much corrupted. They were you see called S. Edwards laws, and to this
day, are. But clearly, diverse Norman customs were in practice first mixed with
them, and to these times continue. as succeeding ages, so new nations (coming
in by a Conquest, although mixed with a title, as of the Norman Conqueror, is to
be affirmed) bring always some alteration. by this well co^siderd, That of the
laws of this realm being never changed will be better understood.

6. Et maxim Romam] Understand not this neither otherwise, but that the Romans
had their laws in such parts of this land, as they had their most civil
government in. I mean in Colonies hither deduced. For every Colonie was but as
an image of the mother City, with like holy rites, like Courts, Laws,
Temples, places of public commerce, and for the most part with Duumviri in
steed of Consuls, and Aediles and Decuriones in lieu of a Senate: and it is
clear that diverse Colonies from Rome were in Britain, as at Camalodunum (now
Maldon in Essex) that was deduced to be subsidium aduersus rebels (as Tacitus
says) and imbue^dis socijs ad officia legu^. And an old inscription remembers
one Aurelius Bassus to be Censitor ciuium Romanorum Coloniae victri censis quae
est in Britannia Camalodunum. At York was also a Colonie. an old piece of
money of Seuerus, thus, COL. EBORACVM. LEG. VI. VICTRIX.

Another inscription is justifying the same in Camden, page 572. although
Aurelius Victor calls it Municipium in his life of Seuerus. Likewise one was at
Chester, anciently called Deuana, Deua, or Deuuana, (as we see in Ptolomy and
Antoninus) from the River Dee. witness an old coin of Septimius Geta thus
inscribd.

COL. DIVANA LEG. XX. VICTRIX. And a fragment of a stone in Bathes walls has

DEC. COLONIAE GLEV. VIXIT ANN. LXXXVI. Glev, is Gloucester, as the most learned
Clarentius Camden teaches. Some think Colchester had a Colonie too. But here
are enough to show, that the laws of Rome were vsd in Britain, as in other
places where the Romans conquered. Seneca ad Albinam cap. 7. Hic denique
populus Colonias in omnes prouincias misit vbicunque vicit Romanus habitat: and
Gildas of this land, non Britannia sed Romania censebatur. So one anciently
speaking to Mars, Romulus, and Claudius, (under who^ the first Colonies were
deduced hither) in Catalect. vet. Poet. lib. 1. tit. 7.

Cernitis ignotos Latia sub lege Britannos.

After Claudius, the Britons began to learn the arts, to exceed the Gauls in
wit and learning, and they that at first did Linguam Romanam abnuere (as
Tacitus speaks in the life of Agricola) did at length eloque^tiam concupiscere.
Inde etiam (says he) habitus nostri honor and frequens toga; paullatimque
discessum ad delinimenta vitiorum porticus and Balnea and conuiuiorum
elegantiam; idque apud imperitos humanitas vocabatur, cum pars seruitutis
esset: and this is spoken of natural Britons, not Colonies. They affected, we
see, Roman language, Rhetorique, Roman habit, Roman pleasures, diet, and the
like. Neither needed Tacitus to have mentioned their, affecting the laws of
Rome, when they were subject to them as a conquered people. And no doubt is, but
they that imitated their Conquerours, and neighbor Colonies in the rest, were
not backward in affecting those laws, for which the languages and rhetorique
were most useful. Iuvenal speaking of Gaul which he calls in Satyr. 7. --
nutricula Causidicorum, says in Satyr. 15.

Gallia Causidicos docuit facunda Britannos,
De conducendo loquituriam rhetore Thule.
The easier might the use and study of the laws of Rome be received here,
after this Claudius his conquest, in regard that those which before and in
ancient time had the determining of controversies, and the learning of that
kind in their hands, were by him forbidden to use any longer their religion,
for which they were most of all reverenced and regarded. I mean the Druides.
and when their holy rites were prohibited by the Emperor, it is likely enough
that the nations governed by them in point of law (as the Gauls and Britons
were) grew regardlesse, at lest remained nothing so respectfull of them as
before, and so became prone to receive the laws of Rome which had both
conquered them, and also taken away the reverence before given to the Druides.
That the Druides before Claudius were the lawiers and determined controversies
I. Caesar is witness lib. 5. and 6. de bello Gallico, compared with the
Catholic opinion in antiquity of an identity (at least in their office,
actions and learning) in Gaul and Britain. That Claudius took away their
religion, Sueton is author in his life cap. 25. Druidarum religionem apud Gallos
dirae immanitatis, and tantum ciuibus sub Augusto interdictam, penitus
aboleuit. With him agrees Seneca in his Apocolocyntosis. It may well enough be
imagined, that the taking it away in Gaul extended to Britain which was both
the nurs^ry of it, and mother too, as Julius Caesar writes. If only to Gaul;
yet it is probable enough that the Druides in Britain could not but suffer by
it, at least in reputation. For that of Pliny not. hist. lib. 30. cap. 1.
Tiberij Caesaris principatus sustulit Druidas Gallorum; it is to be referred
only to Rome as Lipsius well takes it in Comment. ad Tacit. Annal. 12. number. 98.
and in such sense as Sueton speaks of Augustus his forbidding the^ tantum
ciuibus. And indeed although after Claudius, mention be in Tacitus,
Lampridius, and Vopiscus of them, yet shall you not find any sign of their
legal power extant either in those, or in Ammianus Marcellinus that specially
remembers them, but only attributs a study of the mysteries of nature and a
Pythagoricall learning to them, under Constantius and Julian, as you see in his
15. book. For the matter of Colonies before spoken of; he that desires accurat
instruction of their nature and particular rights, may see, besides what such
as writing of the Roman State universally have of it, Lips. de Magnitud. Romana
lib. 1. cap. 6. and Marc. Velser lib. 2. Antiquit. Augustae Vindelicorum.

7 Leges Ciuiles in quantum Romanorum inveteratae sunt.] The antiquity which he
means of our Laws before the Civil of Rome, is only upon these conditions.
First that the story of Brute be to be credited, and then that the same kind
of law and policy has ever since continued in Britain. That Story supposes
him here CCC. years and more before Rome built. But (with no disparagement to
our common laws) we have no testimony touching the inhabitants of the Isle
before Julius Caesar, nor any of the name of it till Polybius, in Greek, nor
till Lucretius in Latin. Polybius lib. 3. speaks of the British Isles, and
Lucretius lib. 6. has Caelum Britannum. Neither is the book de Mundo
attributed to Aristotle of like age with the falsely supposed author. In that,
Albion is spoken of, but Polybius was before that was spoken, if I deceive not
my self. All testimony of later time, made of that which long since must be,
if at all it were, is much to be suspected. And though the Bards knew diverse
things by tradition, which they only sung, and so a specious argument is made
usually for that common story, because they sung it, yet I see not why any,
but one that is too prodigal of his faith, should believe it more then
Poetical story, which is all one (for the most part) with a fiction. For what
were Bards but such as sung the praises of old supposed Heroes at their
pleasure? As Athenaeus and Marcellinus, of them* and, for later authority, you
may see in Leg. Howeli Dha cap. 25. That the chiefest dignity among the^ was
the Pe^kert of the country, whose place was of great eminency before others in
the welsh court, and his office (when the King was pleased to hear any songs)
was Duo Carmina scilicet vnu^ de Deo, alterum de regibus in interiore part
aulae decantare. Nor he nor the rest were bound to truth of Story, but free to
use invention, which they did in making a founder of the British name out of a
community of sound. 'Twas as easy to fetch Brute out of Brutaine, as it is
often called, as it has been to make Francio out of Francia or Franci,
Hispanus or Hispalus out of Hispania, Scota out of Scotia, Angela for a queen
out of Anglia, Bato out of Batauia, Italus out of Italia, and diverse such,
which are all near fictions or impostures. Scarce indeed is there a nation in
Europe, whose deduction from a like name of the first author, is of sufficient
credit. All testimonies any thing near the supposed time of those first autors
being lost. This writer stands on Brutes arrival, and speaks of it Cap. XIII.
Yet if that would make so much for this side of antiquity of our laws, much
more is to be had from the ancienter and true origination of the Britons, which
is from Iaphet and his Posterity. See Camden. and in the Greek Scaligeran
Chronicle of Eusebius, the British Isles, with all the west, are given by
Noah's last will and testament to Iaphet, But so is Italy too, and the rest of
Europe. This way, might an equally strong argument be for the like antiquity
of both laws, of those of Italy and Britain. And it would be such a one as this
author uses from Brute. For questionless, if Iaphet and his posterity possessed
these parts of Europe (as they did) their government was not without laws. But
in truth, and to speak without perverse affectation, all laws in general are
originally equally ancient. All were grounded upon nature, and no nation was,
that out of it took not their grounds; and nature being the same in all, the
beginning of all laws must be the same. As soon as Italy was peopled, this
beginning of laws was there, and upon it was grounded the Roman laws, which
could not have that distinct name indeed till Rome was built, yet remaind
always that they were at first, saving that additions and interpretations, in
succeeding ages increased, and somewhat alterd them, by making a Determinatio
iuris naturalis, which is nothing but the Civil law of any Nation. For
although the law of nature be truly said Immutable, yet its as true that its
limitable, and limited law of nature is the law now vsd in every State. All
the same may be affirmd of our British laws, or English, or other whatsoever.
But the diverse opinions of interpreters proceeding from the weakness of man's
reason, and the several conueniencies of diverse States, have made those
limitations, which the law of Nature has sufferd, very different. And hence
is it that those customs which have come all out of one fountain, Nature, thus
vary from and cross one another in several Common welths. Had the Britons
receiud the X. or XII. Tables from Greece (which in Rome was, as Liuy says, in
immenso aliarum super alias aceruatarum legum cumulo, fons omnis publici
priuatique iuris) clearly the interpretations, and additions which by this time
would have been put to them here, must not be thought on as if they would have
fell out like the body of the Roman Civil law. Diverse nations, as diverse men,
have their diverse collections, and inferences; and so make their diverse laws to
grow to what they are, out of one and the same root. Infinite laws we have now
that were not thought on D. years since. Then were many that D. years before
had no being, and less time forward always produced diverse new; the beginning
of all here being in the first peopling of the land, when men by nature being
civil creatures grew to plant a common society. This rationally considerd,
might end that obuious question of those, which would say something against the
laws of England if they could. It Is their triuiall demand, When and how began
your common laws? Questionless its fittest answered by affirming, when and in
like kind as the laws of all other States, that is, When there was first a
State in that land, which the common law now gouerns: then were natural laws
limited for the conueniencie of civil society here, and those limitations
have been from thence, increased, altered, interpreted, and brought to what now
they are; although perhaps (saving the merely immutable part of nature) now, in
regard of their first being, they are not otherwise then the ship, that by
often mending had no piece of the first materials, or as the house that is so
often repaired, vt nihil ex pristina materia supersit, which yet (by the Civil
law) is to be accounted the same still, as we see in p. tit. de legate. 1. l.
65. si ita. 2. Little then follows in point of honor or excellency specially to
be attributed to the laws of a Nation in general, by an argument thus drawn
from difference of antiquity, which in substance is alike in all. Neither are
laws thus to be compared. Those which best fit the state wherein they are,
clearly deserve the name of the best laws. And none are best or worst but
secundum quid. But upon this ground more to the purpose might have been said
for the English common laws, compard with the civil of Rome. For it appears
that the Emperors from Justinian, who died in D.LXV. of Christ, until Lothar
the 11. in the year M.C.XXV. so neglected the body of the Civil law (which
now, against an express Constit^^^on of Justinian, commanding that it should
not be read nor taught in any place saving Rome, Berytus, and Constantinople,
is professed in every University) that all that time none ever professed it. But
when Lothar took Amalfi, he there found an old copy of the Pandects, or
Digests, which as a precious monument he gave the Pisans (by reason whereof it
was called Litera Pisana) from whom it has bin since translated to Florence,
where in the Dukes Palace it is never brought forth but with Torch-light, and
other reverence. Under that Lothar, began the Civil law to be professed at
Bologna, and Irner or Werner (as some call him) first made Glosses on it about
the beginning of Frederique Barbarossa in M.C.L. of Christ, and Bologna was by
Lothar constituted to be Legum and Iuris Schola vna and sola. And this was the
first time and place of profession of it in the Western Empire. You may see
Odofredum apud Sigonium de regno Italiae lib. 11. and 7. and Paul. Merul.
Cosmogr. part. 2. lib. 4. cap. 23. Why were they so neglected near DC. years in
the Empire, if their excellency were so beyond others, as is usually laid by
many, that, to the purpose, know nothing of either them or ours? This part of
story of them I have noted elsewhere in the Preface to the Titles of Honor. And
clearly you see the profession of them is not so ancient in the Western Empire,
as the latest of time, to which some most ignorantly refer the beginning of the
common law; I mean as the Norman William, who arrived in the year M.LXVI. I
think not, that good discretion can out of any of this or the like add much
honor to, or detract from either Common or Civil law; yet its sit to be
rememberd in answer of such as ignorantly fetch a reason out of the antiquity
of the profession of the one. As if the profession begun under Lothar, and
since thus continued, were not merely new, and not a recontinuance of what was
in use under Justinian. But hereof too much.

8 TEstes.] But some trialls by our law have also Witnesses without a Jury: as
of the life and death of the Husband in Dower, and in Cui in vita. Examples
thereof are in Bracton lib. 4. tract. 6. cap. 7. 2. Ed. 2. tit. Trial 46.8.
Ed. 2. eod. tit. 95.9. Ed. 2. tit. Judgment 231.2. Elizab. Dyer fol. 185. a.
and in 13. Elizab. Die. fol. 301. a. in Error by an infant to reuerse a fine,
both inspection and the testimony of four witnesses concur to prove his
infancy. and in 26. Ed. 3. fol. 70. a pl. 6. a death in Bretagne, is said,
shall be tried by proofs. But all this is of issues, which properly have no
visne, whence a Jury may be. The course of Declarations also at this day show,
that witnesses were respected in the beginning of every action. The conclusion
is always Et inde producit sectam. Which secta or suit, in law-language, is
nothing but witnesses to prove his action, as in the Counts of writs of Right
they were wont to declare, and hoc paratus sum probare per hunc liberum hominem
meum A. B. and si quid, etc. Which was a tender of Battle, as the other is of
suit or witnesses. See Glanvil. lib. 2. cap. 3. And those proofs of the death
of the husband in dower are called secta by Bracton fol. 302. a, and in Nou.
Narrat. suit and darraign bon, is only secta and disrationatio bona.i. good
proof to maintain the count. In ancient time this suit, or witnesses were
examind before any other issue, as in 18. Hen. 3. Coram Rege apud Windsore rot.
13. in dors. in Turr. Land. In a Recordare loquelam that was in the Bishop of
Salisburies court at Sunnings, the action being for a Mare, by Walkelin de Stok
against William de la Guilhalle, the entry is; Et Willielmus producit sectam
suam and ipsi quos produxit per se discordantes sunt in multis, and in tempore,
and in alijs circumstantijs, quia quidam dicunt quod quaedam equa matter ipsius
pullani empta fuit etc. and quidam dicunt etc. Et Walkelinus producit sectam
qui concordati sunt in omnibus and per omnia and dicunt omnes quos ipsi
producit per se etc. The proofs of both sides are called secta. It was either
this or some like case, that Shard intended in 17. Ed. 3. fol. 49. b in John
Warreins case, speaking of a Justice that examind the suit* and it appears
there that under Ed. 3. the tendering of suit or proofs was become only
formal, as at this day, like the plegij de prosequendo. But in Hill. 44. Hen.
3. Coram Rogero de Thurkelby and socijs suis Iustitiarijs de Banco Rot. 16. in
dorso. One Gilbert Chyteine brought a Repleuin against William le Fouler, and
the defendant pledes non cepit etc. Et hoc offert de fendere contra ipsum and
sectam suam sicut Curia Considerauerit. Et quia praedictus Gilbertus nullam
sectam producit versus praedictum VVilielmum, consideratum est quod praedictus
Willielmus eat inde sine die, and Gilbertus in misericordia. See ad cap. 32. I
omit, that in Englesherie anciently, in a Natiuo habendo, in proving a deed
denied, and such like, witnesses by the common law are required as the special
trial.

9 WApentagia.] In Ethelreds laws, which the Abbot John Brampton has in a Ms.
story, cap. 4. Habeantur placita in singulis Wapentakis, vt exeant seniores
XII. thay^i and praepositus cum eis and iurent super sanctuarium quod eis
dabitur in manus quod neminem innocentem velint accusare velnoxium concelare.
And the laws called the Confessors, cap. 33. say that Yorkshire, Lincoln,
Notingham, Leycester, and Northampton, call that Wapentachium quod Anglivocant
Hundredum and non sine causa. For he that was praefectus VVapentachij, or high
Constable of the VVapentach, came amongst them at the Hundred or Wapentach
court, and with regardfull entertainment, they all cum lanceis suis ipsius
hastam tangebant, and ita se confirmabant per contactum armorum, pace palam
concessa. Anglice n. (so say those laws) arma vocantur Waepun, and taccare
confirmare, quasi armorum confirmatio, vel vt magis express secundum linguam
Anglicam dicamus, Wapentac armorum tactus est. Waepun n. arma sonat, tac tactus
est. Doubtless this deduction of the name sauors of the truth. For amongst the
old Germans (whence our Anglo-Saxons came) that vsd to meet armed in their
courts, when any one had spoken, if he were disliked, fremitu aspernabantur, if
liked, frameas concutiebant (as Tacitus witnesses) which well includes this
touching or striking together of weapons. Honoratissimum (says he) assensus
Genus est, armis laudare. The Wapentakes, Hundreds, and Counties were first
instituted by K. Alfred, about the year DCCC.LXXX. Of him, Ingulphus p. 495. b,
Totius Angliae pagos and provincias in Comitatus primus omnium Commutauit.

10 Villas.] Villa and Villata de Norwich, de Wallingford and the like are in

11 Hamletis.] Hameau or Hamel is a member or part of some ville or town, as
you may see in 14. Assis. pl. 9. and 3. and 4. Ph. and Mar. Dyer fol. 142. it

15 FAlsum fecerunt sacramentum.] The ancient punishment in Attaint was as its
here described, and the like in conspiracy for perjury See Glanvil. lib. 2.
cap. 19.4. Hen. 5. tit. Judgment 220.27. Assis. pl. 59. and 46. Assis. pl. 11.
The judgment is called the villainous judgment in 24. Ed. 3. fol. 34. b. See
Bracton also lib. 4. tract. 5. cap. 5. and Flet. lib. 5. cap. 21. and Stamford
fol. 175. And the case in Temp. Ed. 1. tit. Attaint 70. is more large in my Ms.
Report of 21. Ed. 1. fol. 58. it is brought against the Abbot of Westminster,
as there its showed, but the judgment by Weylond is in these words, Pur ceo
agarde cest court que ceux de l' enquest perdent franche ley de ceo iour en
auant a tous iours e lour terres and leur chateus a la volonte le Roy, and lour
cors a la prison, e John seit assous de cele rent and seit restore de ses
damages. But see now Stat. 23. Hen. 8. cap. 3. another judgment in attaint.

16 Nec alicubi recipientur in testimonium veritatis.] Our books express that,
by que mise ne soit en testimoignance de veritye, 24. Ed. 3. fol. 34. b. 33.
Hen. 6. fol. 55. a. It is titled the loss of frank law, franch ley in 27.
Assis. pl. 59. and 46. assis pl. 11. that is, he which is thus convict of
perjury, shall be no more Otheswurth as Bracton calls it lib. 4. tract. 4. cap.
5. and cap. 19.. 2. where his words are of such a one. Legem amittit, and ideo
dicitur quod non est vlterius dignus lege quod Anglice dicitur, He ne is oaths
worth that is enes gylty of oath broken. Which agrees with K. Knout his law
cap. 33. that one so convicted ne beo thanon forth athes wyrthe, the self same
words almost, being in leg. Edwardi senioris cap. 3. and leg. Athelstan cap.
25. That which is legem amittere in this sense in Bracton, is liberam legem
amittere (answering to the loss of frank law) in the entries of judgment
against them, and legem terrae amittere in Glanvill, and sometime in Bract. and
Fleta. See also Regiam Maiestatem lib. 1. cap. 14.. 5. Hence may be truly
understood that of the grand Charter cap. 29. -- nec super eum ibimus nec super
eum mittemus, nisi per legale iudicium Parium suorum vel per begem terrae. I
would English it thus: Neither will we enter on his possession nor commit him
(for in that place of the Charter of 17. of K. John by which this was made, it
is nec eum in carcere mittemus, perhaps it should be carcerem, as the language
requires) but legal judgment of his Peers, or men of his condition (that is by
Jury) or by trial of him by oath, or wager and doing his law. Lex terrae here
is only as it signifies in amittere legem terrae. And Ley gager and a Jury are
the two trialls, as I suppose, there thought on. And indeed in old rolls
nothing is more usual then in criminal actions (not capital) and civil, of
any kind to admit Ley gager, as in Attachments upon prohibitions, quare
impedits and the like, which is against all knowledge and practice of law in
later ages. Every one knows that at this day Vadiare legem is to offer the oath
upon trial that way, and facere legem is to make the oath. all which show that
lex and lex terrae signify in this notion only the Oath of a man not disabl'd
by law. And, in that statut, it is merely the oath upon Ley gager.

18 SI quae supra altum mare etc. coram Admirallo.] As then, so now, the
Admiraltie has Jurisdiction of things don upon the main sea. and what that
court might or may do is showed and limited by the statuts of 13. Rich. 2. cap.
5. and 15. Rich. 2. cap. 3. and 2. Hen. 5. cap. 6. The first case in our law
extant touching marine jurisdiction is in Temp. Ed. 1. tit. Avowry 192. in a
Repleuin brought of a ship upon the cost of Scarborough, where no mention is
of the Admiralls authority, as the print is in the Abridgment, but conisans of
it is allowed to the common law. Yet in my Ms. Report of 25. Ed 1. fol. 82. b
the case is thus more at large, and expressly speaks of the Admiral. William
Crake de Holtham fuit sommon a respondre a Robert de Beufo de play pur que il

the visne might be out of the adjoining county, as in old trialls of issues in
Wales, I conceiu not their disallowance of the exception against the place,
whence properly no visne could be. For such trialls of issues rising in Wales,
or in Counties Palatin by the adjoining Counties, see especially 18. Ed. 2.
tit. Assise 382.24. Ed. 3. fol. 33. b. 30. Hen. 6. fol. 6. b. 35. Hen. 6. fol.
30. a 45. Ed. 3. tit. Uisne 50. I have transcribd the case according to the
very letters of my copy. It seems by this that in those times the common law
had conisans of things done upon the British sea* howeuer it afterward kept its
limits infra corpus Comitatus, leaving the Sea to the Admiralty. Some cases in
old records justify it also. In Placit. 37. and 38. Hen. 3. Rot. 10. Deuon.
One Galfredus de Leysina brings trespass against Ralf de Valle torta, and
others, quare asportauerunt bona quae fuerunt in naui quae fuit Clementis de
Bolan quae nuper periclitabatur in Costera de Brikesham quae bona dominus Rex
dedit predicto Galfredo tanquam wreccum maris etc The defendants plead, in
effect, the general issue, and sic ad patriam. although, through want of form
in the declaration it appears not whether (...) goods were taken being in or
out of the Sea, yet it seems they held that matter indifferent. So in Itin.
Sussex apud Cicestriam 47. Hen. 3. Rot. 10. A fragment of a torn roll left in
the bundle, has this sign of a declaration remaining. Rogerus de Louere, and
Radulphus de Leuere queruntur de Ricardo de Hatfeuld........ proxima ante
festum sancti Martini hoc anno se credebant saluo............ ibidem fregerunt
nauem suam super quendam locum............. nauis and socij sui circiter
quinque submerserunt. These words are only left upon the 9. roll, the rest
being by some wicked hand, purposely, it seems, torn off. But its easily
coniectur'd that this was an action on the case, brought by one that had
committed himself or his goods to the defendants care for his passage, with his
company, over sea, and that the offense was, that the defendant had by
negligence made shipwreck on the sea, or some such like; and though the
Assumpsit at land might make such an action at this day, maintainable at common
law, according to the learning in Dowdales case Rep. 6. fol. 47. yet in those
times so ancient, I cannot imagine the difference of a contract at land from one
at sea was thought on. Likewise in Trin. 50. Hen. 3. apud Westminster. in Banco rot.
22. the entry is, Suff. Abbas Westmonasterij per atturnatum suum obtulit se
quarto die versus Petrum filium Iohannis, Richardum fratrem eius, Walterum
Cheyney, Augustinum filium Iocei, Iohannem fratrem eius, Richardum Andred,
Anthonium Clunch, and Richardum Silkento de placito cum homines ipsius Abbatis
nuper duci fecissent quandam nauem suam per Costeram maris prope Dunwicu^,
bonis and catallis ipsius Abbatis and hominum suorum cariatum, ijdem Petrus and
alij simul cum Augustino filio Iohannis nauem praedictam cum bonis and catallis
praedictis ab hominibus suis praedictis abstulerunt, and nauem and bona and
catalla sic Ablata detin^nt ad damnum ipsius Abbatis and hominum suorum
sexaginta librarum and contra pacem etc. Unless here the ship were taken upon
the sea super Costeram maris I understand it not. But touching their trialls in
the Admiralty, in some hands is extant a Ms. del' Office del Admiralty,
translated into Latin by one Thomas Rowghton, calling it De officio
Admiralitatis (the use of two copies of it, with the roll of Oleron, written
all about Hen. 6. was communicated to me by that learned and truly sufficient
Sir Walter Raleigh knight) where enditements and trialls are supposd to be by
a Jury of XII. as at common law. But the book it self is rather a monument of
antiquity (yet not above about Hen. 6.) then of authority, and rather as a
purpose of what was in some failing project, then ever in use and judgment held
authentical. Most of it is against both the now received and former practice.
Yet these things has it worth observation* that is, constitutions often
mentioned touch^^g the Admiralty of Hen. 1. Richard. 1. King John, and Edward
1. which are elsewhere hardly found. In rot. Pat. 23. Ed. 1. William Leyburn
is Admiral, and often mention is after that of the Admiralls of the North and
South seas, the distinction being the Thames mouth, as Trent was wont to be for
the general Escheatorship, and is for the Iusticeship of the Forests. The
first mention of the Admiral in our printed law, is in 8. Ed. 2. Itin. Canc.
tit. Corone 399. with that, see 40. Ed. 3. fol. 44.40. Assis. pl. 25. Stamford
cap. des Coroners, Sir Henry Constables case in Rep. 5. fol. 107. and Hill. 2.
Jacob. Philipps case in Com. Banco, and 19. Hen. 6. fol. ^. a. and note that in
7. Rich. 2. Statham tit. Trespass 54. a justification is in trespass in these
words nous les prisomous en le have mere ouesque les Normans queux sont enemies
le Roy, judgment si action, and held good. If this issue offered rising wholly
on the main sea, might not be tried at the common law, how could it be good?
either a trauerse must have been to the taking in the count, or else the
replication must have made the issue upon two affirmatiues (which is against
the course of our law) or else questionless they took it in those times
triable, as it was pleded by a Jury of the visne, either adioining to the coast
(which is fittest) or of the place where the action was laid. See also 46. Edw.
3. Statham tit. Trespass 38.

19 Curiae Constabularij*] That court and the great Officer, chief Justice of
it, has been long discontinued. Neither was any continuing High Constable of
England since 12. Hen. 8. when Edward Duke of Buckingham was beheaded. He was
the last High Constable, and by inheritance of tenure from the Bohuns, as you
see in 6. Hen. 8. Kel. fol. 170. and seq. and 11. Eliz. Die. 285. b. and vide

20 Legem mercatoriam.] that is such as the law of the staple in stat. 2.27.
Ed. 3 cap. 2. Mention is of it in Regist. Orig. in Computo fol. 135. a and
Fitzh. Not. Br. fol. 117. D. Indeed the nature of this law is well expressed by
Bartol. in p. tit. Mandati vel contra l. 29.. quaedam 4. speaking of the
Merchants court (which name may well be given to the court of Pee poudrous.)
Nota, says he, quod in Curia Mercatorum debet iudicari de bono and aequo,
omissi^ iuris solennitatibus. Hoc non dico quod debeat intelligi non habito
respectu ad iura ciuilia quod esset contra l. bona fides tit. Depositi, sed
debet intelligi non inspectis solennitatibus iuris, hoc est non inspectis
apicibus qui veritatem negotij non tangunt, vt si esset intentata actio directa
cum competebat vtilis, vel non erat contestata lis and similia. For in common
society of Merchants, and mutual contracts, equity and good conscience rather
then strict law is required. Tryphonius p. tit. Depositi vel contra l. 31. Bona
fides quae in contractibus exigitur, aequitatem summam desiderat. A special
case of this law Merchant is in Itin. Derb. 2. Edw. 2. Ms. where John Combton
brings debt secundum legem mercatoriam upon a tally, against another merchant,
and tenders suit by two witnesses: the defendant wages his law, but the
judgment is thus by Ornesby pronounced. John de Combton Marchand port un brief
ciens verse un Rauf Marchand and demand vj. marks par un Iusticies form selon
la ley Marchand (it had been commenc't. by Iusticies, and came out of the
common place into the Eire) and ad mis aua^t un taille la que^le il tender a

against the laws of Italy, but remember not any story or authority teaching
that any of our Kings would have had them here vsd. That of Stephen is related
by that noble and most learned Friar Roger Bacon in his Compendium Theologiae,
or his Opus minus (both those names are of one Ms. book) where speaking of the
Civil laws of Italy, and that they are abusd, and too much affected by Clergy
men, leaving their profession to study those laws, he thus adds; Praeterea omne
regnum habet sua iura quibus laicireguntur; vt iura Angliae and Franciae; and
ita fit iustitia in alijs regnis per constitutiones quas habent sicut in Italia
per suas. Quapropter cum iura Angliae non competant statui clericorum, nec
Franciae, nec Hispaniae, nec Almanniae, similiter nec iura Italiae ^llo modo.
Quod si debeant clerici vti legibus patriae, tunc est minus inconueniens vt
Clerici Angliae vtantur legibus Angliae and Clerici Franciae vtantur legibus
Franciae, quapropter maxima confusio Clericoru^ est quod huiusmodi
constitutionibus laicalibus subduntur colla. Rex quidam Angliae Stephanus
allatis legibus Italiae in Angliam publico edicto prohibuit, n^ ab aliquo
retinerentur. si igitur laicus princeps laici principis alterius leges
respueret, multo magis omnis clericus deberet respuere leges laicorum. Addo
etiam quod magis concordant iura Franciae cum Angliae and econvers^ propter
vicinitatem regnorum and communicationem maiore^ gentium istarum quam Italiae
and illarum. Quare deberent magis clerici Angliae subijcere se legibus Franciae
and e converso quam legibus Lombardiae. This was a kind of invectiue against
the receiving of the Civil law among the Clergy in any other nation, saving
that wherein it was first bred* that is the Italian. Our stories have no mention
of this edict of Stephen. But it is in an author of better authority (in regard
of his time) then Friar Bacon. I mean John of Salisbury living under Hen. 2. He
in his De Nugis Curialium lib. 8. cap. 32. speaking of such as too profanely
meddled with what the Clergy had to do, goes on with alios vidi qui legis
libros deputant igni nec scindere verentur, si in manus eorum pervenirent iura
vel Canones. Tempore Regis Stephani a regno iussae sunt leges Romanae quas in
Britanniam domus venerabilis patris Theobaldi Britanniarum primatis asciuerat.
Ne quis etiam libros retineret edicto regio prohibitu^ est, and vicario nostro
indictum silentium. Sed, deo faciente, eo magis virtus legis invaluit, quo eam
amplius nitebatur impietas infirmare. Whereas Friar Bacon takes it clear that he
prohibited the Civil laws, this John of Salisbury (a man of great place and
authority both with the King and Pope) seems to affirm it only of the Canon
law. For he remembers it as an offense to the Church. Indeed in Archb.
Theobalds time both the Canons and Civil law began to be published, and its
like enough that he might bring in Iuo's or Gratian's Decree. Iuo's was written
in time of Hen. 1. and Gratians under K Stephen. That Theobald was before Abbot
of Bec in Normandy, and went to Rome for his Pall, and so, it seems, brought
those laws home with him in 3. Stephani Regis. Its marvel that our stories
are so silent of this of K. Stephen. But see the Monks sub anno 1139. and
specially Guil. Malmesb. hist. Novel. 2. fol. 103. b. touching the council of
Winchester, where the ground of his Prohibition perhaps shows it self.

Ad CAP. XXXIV.
22 QVod Principi placuit.] That is Vlpians in p. tit. de Constit. Princip. l.
1 Quod Principi placuit legis habet vigorem, vtpote cum lege Regia, quae de
imperio eius lata est, populus ei et in eum omne suum imperium et potestatem
conferat. The same is in Instit. tit. de Iure not.. sed and quod. and thence
have the Greek Lawiers their (...), as Harmenopulus a Judge of Thessalonica
expresses it Procheir. lib. a. tit. a. and the Emperor is in Near. Diatax. 105.
cap. ^. titled (...), a living law. The two Codes of Theodosius and Justinian,
the Gregorian and Hermogenian Codes, the Nearae Diataxeis or Authentiques, and
the rest of the Nouellae are nothing but Constitutions by the Emperors, to whom
the State of Rome permitted all by the lex Regia that was before in the people
of Rome.

Ad CAP. XXXIX
23 PRolem ante matrimonium.] This point of Civil law, is text in C. tit. de
Naturalibus lib. l 10. cum quis. Quomodo ( says Justinian) non est
iniquissimum ipsam stirpem secundae posteritatis priorem quasi iniustam
excludere, cum gratias agere fratribus suis posteriores debeant, quorum
beneficio ipsi sunt iusti filij, and nomen and ordinem consecuti. For the birth
of the first is often cause of the marriage following. But it is limited by some
Doctors, that the woman be before in concubinatu, in familia retenta, that
there be indubitatus affectus sicut in vxore etc. as you may see in Bartol. ad
finem p. de Concubinis. Mynsinger. ad Instit. de Nuptijs. Aliquando. Gothofred.
ad Novel. 89. cap. 15. The Canon law agrees with the Civil in this matter, as
is shown in an Epistle of Pope Alexander 3. to the Bishop of Excester in Ext.
tit. Qui filij sint legit. c. 6. Tanta est vis.

Ad CAP. XL.
24 SIbonus est bastardus.] yet see Tiraquell. de Nobilitate cap. 15. and
Pontus Heuterus his collection touching Bastards at the end of his De veteri
Belgio, and you shall find, that most of the brave spirits and able, of the
former times, are in the catalogue of famous Bastards. Remember Euripides in
his Andromache Many Bastards are better then legitimats.
(...), says he, (...).

Ad CAP. XLII.
25 PArtus semper sequitur ventrem.] That is in respect of being free or bond.
In liberali causa, matris non patris inspicitur conditio C. tit. de lib. causa
l. 28. aui and l. 42. placuit and de rei vendic l. 7. Partum. where the DD.
dispute this point. But in matter of honor, or, as it were, hereditarie office
their law is otherwise, as you may see in C. tit. de Decurionibus l. 22. eos.
l. 36. Exemplo l. 44. nul^us. and tit. de Murilegulis l. 15. qui aut. But the
true reason was upon this; that where marriage or iura connubij could not be,
there always partus sequebatur ventrem, in regard no legal father was of such
a birth. and the iura connubij extended, before Christianity received, only to
free men. Vlpian in his Tituli, tit. de his. qui in potestate sunt has these
words, which are more worth then all the barbarous Doctors comments. Connubio
interveniente, liberi semper patrem sequuntur; non interveniente connubio,
matris conditioni accedunt, excepto eo qui ex peregrino and ciue Romana,
peregrinus nascitur: quoniam lex Mensia (from whom that law is so called I
remember not) ex alterutro peregrino natum deterioris parentis conditionem
sequi iubet. Ex ciue Romano and Latina, Latinus nascitur, and ex libero and
ancilla, seruus, quoniam quum his casibus connubia non sunt, partus sequitur
matrem. For his speech of a Roman's marying with an Italian woman (not a
Roman,) believe it not without examination of such story as you may find
collected in Carol* Sigon. de antiq. iure Ciu. Romans lib. 1. cap. 9. and others
dealing with that subject. But clearly its true generally, that where iura
connubij were not, there the Roman law makes the issue follow the mother, as
the law of nature* requires, which the same Vlpian says also in p. tit. de
statu hominum l. 24. lex. in which title l. 19. Celsus agrees with what we
have transcribd from Vlpian. And the marriages with bond persons, were always
accounted but contubernia, and not connubia, and they were styled
contubernales, not coniuges, as appears in p. tit. de legatis 3. l. 41. vxorem.
2. Codicillis, and C. tit. de incest. nuptijs l. 3. cum ancillis.

26 Mulieres honor maritorum.] The text is not voucht out of the true place.
it is in C. tit. de incolis l. fin. and also in C. tit. de Dignit. l. 13.

Ad CAP. XLIV.
27 PRoximis de eorum sanguine.] The Civil law first gave the wardship (of
males till XIV. of females till XII.) to the adgnati, or those qui per masculos
coniunguntur, and this was by the laws of the XII. tables, as appears p. tit.
de legitimis Tutoribus l 1. Instit. de legit. tutela. But the difference twixt
adgnati and cognati both in inheritance, as also in wardships, Justinian took
away in Authent. 118. cap. 5. and this is that which is here spoken of, and so
is that law at this day.

28 Ex part matris.] This matter of socage wardship is grounded upon that
ancient ground, held to this day regularly. Nunquam custodia alicuius de iure
alicui remanet de quo habeatur suspicio quod possit vel velit aliquod ius in
ipsa hereditate clamare. Glanvil has it lib. 7. c. 11. and Bracton lib. 2. c.
37.. 6. which is the same in substance in Litleton. 123. and Breton cap. 66.

29 In actibus bellicis] For, the ground and cause of Knight service wardships,
was in this, that the Lords of whom the infants held, might bring them up till
full age, and instruct them in military performances, that so they might be
better able to do their services by which they held; which because they could
not do in their infancy, the profits of the land was, as at this day, taken
by the Lords to supply the defect of service. Neither is this custom of
Wardship so new, as Randolf Higden in his Polychronicon, or rather some others
not understanding him, ignorantly make it, by supposing the beginning of it
here under Hen. 3. Clearly Wardships were before and from the Normans, at lest.
See the Grand Custumier, and Glanvil lib. 7. cap. 9. Neither, if Higden
himself had understood those words in his Chronicle, which he took out of a
former, written by an other Monk of Chester, which I have seen, had any
authority there been for Henry the thirds beginning them. His words are these,
sub anno 1224. and 6. Hen. 3. Magnates Angliae concesserunt Regi Henrico Wardas
haeredum and terrarum suarum quod fuit initium multorum malorum in Anglia. An
old Chronicle in that inestimable Library of Sir Robert Cotton, written by
another of Hiagens covent, under the same year; Magnates Angliae reddiderunt
Wardas suas Regi quod suit initium malorum. This Monk knew what he said, and
vsd the word Wardas chiefly for Forts, Castells, Honors, and the like. by which
the possessors preserved their safety in those troublesome times. For at
Northampton all such were rende^d to the king by the Nobility, upon the
exaction of Hubert de Burgo chief Justice, as both Matthew Paris, and
Florilegus express in these words, reddiderunt singuli castella, municipia,
honores and custodias Regi quae ad coronam suam spectare videbantur. Perhaps
custodiae might here comprehend the wardship too of some heirs: But if so, yet
they were such as some great men possessed by reason of ancient tenures, and the
King would then have with the Castells, and Fortresses by others held, that he
might enjoy them with their enheritances, as part of security against the
Barons. No such intent is in any of the elder Monks, as some would extract out
of Polychronicon. Neither was that giving of Wardships to the King, other then
as if the Nobility should now give all their Wards to the King; supposing that
the story were chiefly of giving Wardships of body and land in the common
sense of Wardae, as Higden misreports it. But for the true understanding of
that in story, take Rot. Fin. ^. Hen. 3. memb. 4. where a recital is provisum
est de consilio Archiepiscopi Cant. and Episcoporum Angliae and H. de Burgo
Iustitiarij nostri and Comitum and Baronum nost^orum quod a die sci Barnabae
Apostoli proximo praeterito caperentur in manum nostram omnia dominica nostra
etc. and hereupon writs go into all Shires, to seize into the Kings hands all
such lands, castles, forts, manors etc. But for the antiquity of Wardships in
Britain, both England and Scotland, See also Hect. Boet. l. 11. Buchanan Rer.
Scot. l. 6. and 10. and leges Malcolmi 2

Ad CAP. XLVI.
30 DVodecim denariorum valorem excedat.] So is it understood in the statut of
West. 1. cap. 15. that speaks of ^nditements of petit larceny que n' amount
ouster le value de xij. deniers. And therewith agrees Itin. Canc. 8. Ed. 2.
tit. Corone 404.406. and 415. But by Breton cap. 15. value of XII. d. without
more, makes it capital felony. So are also opinions in 18. Assis. pl. 14.22.
Assis. pl. 39. See Stamford lib. 1. cap. 15.

Ad CAP. XLVII.
31 IN vniuersitatibus.] Indeed the study of the common law has not place in
our universities of Oxford or Cambridge, because another university (the Innes
of Court) is appointed for it. Yet the statuts of the University of Cambridge,
Earum legum (says Doctor Cowell in his Epistle before his Institutions, as he
calls it, of the laws of England) quas habet patria nostra, imperitos nos esse
prohibent, vt differentias exteri patrijque iuris sic cognoscamus.

Ad CAP. XLVIII.
32 GAllica.] Touching this, Ingulphus Abbot of Crowland, at the conquest,
thus: Ipsum etiam idioma (Normanni) tantum abhorrebant, quod leges terrae,
statutaque Anglicorum regum lingua Gallica tractarentur: and pueris etiam in
scholis principia literarum grammatica gallice, ac non Anglice traderentur,
modus etiam scribendi Anglicus omitteretur and modus Gallicus in chartis and in
libris omnibus admitteretur. And Robert Holkot a learned Dominican Friar in
lect. XI. super Sapientiam. Narra^t historiae quod cum Willielmus Dux
Normannorum regnum Angliae conquisiuisset deliberauit quomodo linguam Saxonicam
posset destruere and Angliam and Normanniam in idiomate concordare, and ideo
ordinauit quod nullus in Curia regis placitaret nisi in Gallico, et iterum quod
puer quilibet ponendus ad literas addisceret Gallica^ et per Gallicam Latinam,
quae duo vsque hodie obseruantur. He says the French continued till his time.
For he died in the great plague 24. Ed. 3. But by statut of 36. Edw. 3. cap.
15. it was alterd, which is the Statut this author speaks of.

Ad CAP. LI.
33 AD Peruisum.] This, Chaucer remembers in his Sergeant. A Sergeant at law
ware and wise,
That often had been at the Peruise.
It signifies an afternoons exercise or Moot, to the instruction of young
Students, bearing the same name originally (I guess) with the Paruisiae in
Oxford, as they call their sitting Generals in the schools in the after noon;
which ingenuously I confess, I first learned out of Mr Wake his Musae
Regnantes page 125. where he deuides the Quodlibets or Disputationes Magnae,
which are their exercises of Regent Masters in the forenoon, from Paruae, that
is, Scholars exercise in the after noon. Has (are his words) quia ijs

seruitium, etc. quod O. ei deforciat. Ne amplius etc. vel sic.

Rex A. de N. S. praecipimus tibi etc. de quatuor virgatis terrae etc. quas

Hic non dicatur, per annum.

capiuntur de scuto, vel per seruitium vnde december carucatae terrae, vel tot
Hydae terrae faciunt feodum vnius militis pro omni seruicio.

Hic non dicitur, per annum.

Breue de recto de dote semper debet dirigi haeredi viri vel eius custodi, si
haeres infra aetatem extiterit, nisi tenementu^ illud denenerit in manus
capitalis domini pro defectu haeredum; quia tunc debet dirigi capitali domino,
vt inferius patebit suo loco.

CAP. II. Quae placita pertinent ad Maiorem Curiam Domini Regis, and quae ad
Vicecomites provinciarum pertinent placitanda.
COnstat quod placita de Crimine laesae Maiestatis, vt de Nece vel seditione
personae domini Regis vel regni vel exercitus, homicidio, raptu, Incendio,
roberia, pace domini Regis fracta, crimine falsi, and si quae sunt similia, vbi
scilicet imminet periculum vitae and membrorum, ad Curiam domini Regis Maiorem
pertinent audienda and de terminanda. Placita vero de furtis, melletis,
hutesio, plagis, verberibus, transgressionibus, vbi non agitur de pace domini
Regis fracta, ad Vicecomites pertinent audienda and determinanda. De placito
vero terrae, similiter potest vicecomes cognoscere. quemadmodum quando placitu^
aliquod diuertitur a Curia Baronis propter defectum ipsus Curiae, and quando
conuenitur ipse tenens in Comitatu absolute. ex quo dominus feodi non potest ex
officio facere hanc Assisam in Curiam suam venire, videtur quod non defuit
petenti de recto, quando non falsat. Tunc ipse petens supplicabit capitali
domino vt remittat ei Curiam suam. Et tunc potest ire been ad Comitatum si
velit. Et haec est cautela necessaria.

CAP. III. De jurisdiction Curiae Baronis and qualitur procedendum est in
eadem.
QVodlibet autem breue de Rect^, praeterquam breue paruum secundu^
consuetudinem manerij, debet esse patens, and praecipe in capite clausum, and
debet deferri in Curia ipsius Baronis de quo ipse petens clamat tenere terram
petitam. Potest autem petens si voluerit in Curia illa prosequi loquelam suam
vsque ad discussionem litis per narrationem narratam, vel feriationem duelli.
Sed sitenens posuerit se in Magnam assisam domini Regis in Curia illa,
remanebit loquela illa hoc modo. Tenens ille adibit Curiam and habebit breue
Regis ad vicecomitem loci, per quod breue idem vicecomes prohibebit dicto
domino feodi ne teneat placitum in Curia sua, nisi duellum fuerit inde
vadiatu^, eo ordine quo rex mandat quando huiusmodi placitum deducitur in
Comitatum. Et tenens semper gaudebit esionijs suis tam de malo veniendi quam de
malo lecti. Tamen in adoptione petentis erit, si voluerit in eadem Curia tam
diu deducere placitum suum, vel non. Qui si voluerit abinde recedere, adeat
balliuum Regis and probet sacramento suo vel per duos testes Curiam domini sibi
de recto def^cisse, and sic velit nolit dominus ipsius Curiae, etiam invito
ipso tenente, potest huiusmodi loquela sic transferri ad comitatum. Et quid si
Curia ipsius Baronis non defece^^t ipsi petenti de recto, qui sic transtulerit
loquelam suam ad Comitatum? Certe dominus illius Curiae, si voluerit, potest
retrahere loquelam illam in Curiam suam, and eam ibi terminare ordine
praedicto; Dum tamen sufficienter probare poterit Curiam suam de recto dicto
petenti non defecisse. Videtur autem quod idem Dominus Curiae potest adeo
simpliciter procedere in huiusmodi probatione, sicut potest dictus petens in
probatione falsandi curiam suam. In Maiori autem Curia domini Regis, potest
Idem Dominus facere consimilia; tamen raro contingit. Paruum enim seu nullum
dominis curiarum in huiusmodi placitis tenendis proficuum ascribitur. Et
sciendum quod in Curia Baronis non debet Attornatus aliquis admitti sine breui
domini Regis. Potest equidem dominus alicuius curiae si voluerit ex gratia per
literas suas patentes scribere domino Regi quod remisit ei curiam suam, si
tantum diligat ipsum petentem; qua litera porrecta in Cancellaria domini Regis,
petens ipse habebit suum praecipe de recto* diretum vicecomiti, per quod
precipiet tenenti quod reddat terram petitam, and nisi tenens hoc fecerit and
ipse petens fecerit ipsum vicecomitem securum de clamore suo prosequendo tunc
summoneatur ipse tenens quod sit ad certum diem in Banco. Et sic ante aliquem
ingressum litis in curiam comitatus vel Baronis, potest huiusmodi loquela vel
placitum primo die diuerti ad Curiam domini Regis Maiorem.

CAP. IIII. Qualiter procedendum est in Comitatu post Curiam Baronis alicuius
falsa^am. Breue de Pace. Recordum Comitatus. Falsum iudicium in Comitatu.
Sectatores.
PRobata siquidem ea solennitate qua decet, quod Curia Baronis defecerit
huiusmodi petenti de recto, potest ipse p^tens in eadem curia prose qui
loquelam suam si voluerit in omni euentu, vsque ad diffinitam discussionem
litis. Hoc t^. excepto, si tenens posuerit se in magnam assisam domini Regis
super repetita. Et si tenens sic se posuerit, ad proximum sequentem Comitatum,
gaudere potest essonio, ita quod in secundo comitatu protendat in pleno
comitatu breue de pace quod vocatur prohibemus. Tunc remanebit loquela ad
petitionem tenentis vsque dum venerint Iustitiarij ad omnia placita. Ex hoc
liquet quod nec dominus alicuius feodi, nec vicecomes regis, qui mayor est in
jurisdiction, pos^it aliquem liberum hominem ad corporale sacramentum ponere
sine breui domini Regis. quod si facere possent, and tam dominus ille quam
vicecomes ex officio sibi commisso huiusmodi magnas assisas caperent suis
locis. Caveat rursus reus sibi qui se sic in illam assisam regalem posuerit
quod dictum breue de pace deferat ad proximum comitatu^ vel secundum, saluato
t^. per essonium primo Comitatu post talem positionem. Quod si non fecerit, ad
calumnia^ petentis per praecisam amissionis defaltam, se ipsum ac perpetuam
eius successionem priuare iudicabitur de petitis. Hanc vero defaltam habet
Comitatus determinare and inde Recordum in omnibus al. breuibus.
Curijs reportare, quicquid erit in Comitatu in huiusmodi placito, ante
positionem in magnam assisam vel duelli vadiationem. Etiam, si apparentibus
partibus quereletur and respondeatur, sieve loquela per nontenuram vel per
quemcunque al. bipartiuo cum.
bipertijocum cauilletur lis illa, dummodo detur dies ad proximum Comitatum
partibus, ad petitionem petentis, per breue quod dicitur pone, potest
transferri negotium, sieve placitum illud fuerit, coram iustitiaris in Banco vel
Itinerantibus in ipso Comitatu. Et sic ad nihilabitur processus inde habitus,
and stat breue. Petens autem quicunque fuerit moderata gratia potest habere
Pone. Supponendum est n. quod procrastinatio petitionis non praeiudicat
occupa^ti. verbi gratia. si Peterem a te fundu^ hodie mihi restitui, quod me
procurante differtur, possit a casu tibi occupanti proficere. ideo quia ponere
aliquam loquelam extra comitatum vbi celerior litis habetur determinatio quam
in banco al. congrauare
and quia presumitur quod petens petitionem maturare debet. Et sic patet, quia
prorogat quod al. congrauare
congerere debet petens, ex gratia cursoria conceditur sibi Pone, Tenenti autem
ne quaquam, nisi ex gratia maiori, and causa speciali, vtpote, si vicecomes
loci fuerit de stipite consanguinitatis vel aliqua affinitate sieve particeps in
petitione petentis, vel aliquantisper rei offensa separauerit vicecomitem a
tenente. ex dicta causa sieve aliqua alia rationabili interueniente innuitur
tenenti dictum Pone. A vicecomite vero prefixo die litigantibus in Comitatu, ad
primum comitatum potest tenens facere defalta^. Caveat tn. quod infra XV. dies
terram suam replegiet, quod si non fecerit, seisina^ perpetua^, nisi aliunde
recuperet, amittet. vel ad primum Comitatum potest essoniari de malo veniendi,
and ad secundum facere defaltam and ad tertium de malo lecti. Essonium autem de
malo lecti semper sequitur essonium de malo veniendi, and non econtra. Tamen
vicecomes ex officio suo mittere debet qua^uor milites de eodem Comitatu ad
videndum infirmum, eo ordine quo faceret si placitum esset in Banco; and ideo
praecipietur ei hoc idem facere per breue de iudicio. Ipsi quoque milites,
secundum quod infirmus surgere aut languorem capere elegerit, praefigant ei
diem quindenae, vel vnius anni and vnius diei. Breue ad videndum infirmum.

Rex vicecomiti salutem. mitte quatuor legales milites de Comitaetu tuo vsque
N. ad I. qui languidus est ad videndum vtrum infirmitas quase essoniauit de
malo lecti versus B. de placito terrae quod est inter eos in Comitatu tuo, sit
languor necne. Et si sit languor tunc ponant ei diem a die visus sui in vnum
annum and vnum diem apud Turrim London praefato B. inde responsurus, vel
sufficientem per se mittat responsalem. Et si non sit languor tunc ponant ei
diem a die visus sui in XV. dies quod tunc sit ad proximum Comitatum tali
praefato B. inde responsuru^ vel sufficientem etc. Et dic quatuor militibus
illis quod tunc sint ibi ad testificandum visum illum and quem diem ei
posuerunt, and habeas ibi nomina militum and hoc breue.

Ante visum terrae petitum and factum, potest tenens essoniari de malo lecti,
and post visum similiter, precedenti semper essonio de malo veniendi. Sed
tantum vnus languor capi potest ante visum vel post, pro voluntate tenentis,
and non plus, quamuis essonium de malo lecti in Maiori Curia domini Regis,
vtpote ad Bancu^ vel in Itinere Iustitiariorum, iaci debeat tertio die ante
diem placiti prefixum and per duos essoniatores. Et hoc in praesentia
Co^stabularij Castri, ciuitatis, vel Burgi vbi huiusmodi placita tenentur, qui
inde Recordum portat coram eisdem Iustitiarijs vel cora^ Maiore huiusmodi
ciuitatis si Castrum non habeatur, nec per consequens Constabularius. Quia
frequenter euenit quod comitatus tenentur in siluis, and Campestribus foris,
villis and al. tales seu ^alas.
alibi. videtur n. quod calumniatio essonij de malo lecti non proiecti ante
tertium diem, nec per duos testes locum non tenet. quia in talibus locis nulla
residet talis persona quae talia recordare vel testificare posset vel deberet.
Tamen si huiusmodi placitum fuerit coram Iustitiarijs de Banco vel
Itincrantibus, debet ex consuetudine and iure huiusmodi essoniu^ iaci ad
Castrum Comitatus vel Burgi coram Constabulario vel ad Turrim Londoniae pro
Banco, vel alibi in Itinere Iustitiariorum propter huiusmodi reseantiam. Idem
dico de Curia Baronis. Non n. tenens ignorant a quo domino tenet and cui feodo
est annexus. Per duos autem essoniatores solemnizari debet tale essoniu^, vt
vnus per essonium excuset infirmum, and alius propter priorem excusationem in
essonio de malo veniendi, in hoc essonio quasi iterato de vna and eadem
aegritudine, testimonium perhibeat. Et idem iaci debet tertio die ante diem
litis, propter computationem dierum in anno bissextili, vt cum detur dies
languido a die visus sui in vnum annum and vnum diem per ipsum diem integrum
ante tertium diem, ante die^ litis possit saluari dies excrescens in anno
bissextili, and computari in integritate anni, quo dictum essonium proiectum
fuit, Test consilio domini Henrici Regis, ac breui suo inde directo
Iustitiarijs suis de Banco anno regni regis Henrici LIIII. Essonium autem de
vltra mare de iure locum non tenet nisi in prima excusatione iaceatur, and hoc
intelligito nisi reus iter arripuerit versus vltra mare prius quam
summonitionem receperit. si n. reciperetur huiusmodi essonium de vltra mare
post essoniu^ de malo veniendi, vel summonitionemsaltem, frequenter accideret
quod ipse reus malitiose hoc faceret ad prorogandum ius petentis. Et ideo locum
tenet in prima excusatione litis. Quia ex quo implacitatus ille iter arripuerit
ante summonitionem receptam, videtur quod non constabat ei dies de placito
praedicto. Et quid si reus de vltra mare essoniatus tali die essonij proiecti,
fuerit in regno. Certe si petens hoc eodem die calumniet, ad aliud diem placito
prefixum dummodo hoc sufficienter probare poterit, reo adiudicabitur pro
defalta. Interest autem Iustitiariorum inquirere huius rei veritatem. Vicecomes
autem in suo comitatu similiter faciat, aut probationem illius petentis
recipiat sexta manu. Comperto siquidem ipsum reum in die dicti essonij proiecti
extitisse in regno, reus ille amittet seisina^ terrae petitae per defaltam.
Essonium de seruicio D. Regis semper admittitur and locum tenet ad alium diem,
dummodo porrigatur breue domini Regis de warranto essonij praedicti. Et si reus
non porrigat sic, cadit illud breue in defaltam amittendi seisinam terrae. Et
si placitum fuerit de captione auerioru^ cadit in misericordia^ tanqua^
indefensus, and petens habebit per iudicium retornum aueriorum. Quando dominus
Rex est in exercitu, reo secum existente, and hoc liquet in Cancellaria domini
Regis, warrantum habebit, Sed si rege non existente in exercitu miserit aliquem
talem in seruicio suo, si hoc in rotulis Cancellariae non inseratur oportet
quod aliquis miles compatriota ipsius sacramento testificetur ipsum reum esse
tali die in seruicio domini Regis antequam breue de seruicio suo concedatur. Si
n. sine rita examinatione concedetur tale breue, ordo iuris creberrime
peruerteretur. Nam in quocunque statu esset lis huiusmodi sieve post vel ante
positionem in magnam assisam aut duelli vadiatione^, per talem warrantum posset
ius petentis retardari and casualiter imperpetuum. Et ideo tali solemnitate
fiat huiusmodi warrantizatio. De plerisque autem placitis potest Comitatus
far recordum. Vt cum quis alique^ implacitauerit in Comitatu per breue domini
Regis de Consuetudinibus and seruicijs, and ipse reus dedicit in pleno comitatu
ipsi petenti huiusmodi seruicia petita, and ipsum disaduocet pro domino. Tunc
dominus ille posteritate dierum petierit per breue domini Regis de Recto de
petendo tenementum illud de quo dedicta sunt huiusmodi seruicia petita,
habendum in dominico pro seruicio sic dedicto. Si reus ille hoc in responsione
negauerit, sieve in eodem Comitatu id neget, sieve in Maiori Curia, habet
comitatus in hac causa far recordum. Et si Comitatus sic recordatur, petens
recuperabit de praedicto tenente seisinam perpetuam, and si Comitatus
econtrario recordetur, petens amittet clamium imperpetuu^. De his portat
Comitatus Recordum. De positionibus in magna^ assisam, duelli vadiatione,
defaltis post defaltam, vtpote post visum terrae factum; vt in defaltis; si
reus postquam se posuerit in magnam assisam, ad proximu^ comitatum non tulerit
breue domini Regis de pace quod vocatur prohibemus; vel essoniatus fuerit ad
proximum comitatum post huiusmodi positionem and ad secundum non deferat dictum
breue, and in singulis placitis terrae vbi tenens amittet per defaltam. Et in
vt legarijs, and in prosecutione appelli sine breui, vel cum breui, habet
comitatus portare recordum in eodem comitatu, and in maiori curia domini Regis.
Tamen si reus fecerit defalta^ in eodem comitatu post visum terrae factum, and
ad calumniam ipsius petentis summonitus esset ille reus ad audiendum iudicium
suum, and deferat suum pone ad amouendam loquelam illinc coram Iustitiarijs de
Banco, quod per assignationem causarum superius expressarum facere possit ex
gratia speciali, generaliter sunt reincipienda omnia retroacta in comitatu ante
positionem in magnam assisam vel duelli vadiationem. and cum per pone venerit
loquela ad Bancu^ in praedicta defalta post visum, comitatus non portat
recordu^. Singula placita sine breui deducta in Comitatum, extra comitatum
carent Recordo ipsius comitatus. Et omnia placita deducta in Comitatum per
breue transferri possunt per breue coram Iustitiarijs de ^^nco, vel Itinere,
and non econverso. Quia in ipsomet Pone semper sic dicitur; Pone ad petitionem
petentis loquelam quae est in Comitatu tuo per breue nostrum de recto etc. Tunc
igitur sequitur ex verbo illo [ per breue nostrum] quod si pete^s non agat per
breue, quod nulla est ibi loquela. Hoc autem dico ad adnulland^m opinionem
Rusticorum rural^um qui frequenter ex impetuoso garritu, vt appareant quod non
sint, sustinent econverso. Sin autem placitum fuerit in Comitatu sine breui vel
cum breui, executiones Iudiciorum habitorum in comitatu fient and fieri debent
per Balliuos domini Regis eiusdem comitatus. Quemadmodum sieve, per narrationem
narratam, sieve per defaltam post defaltam, adiudicetur ipsi petenti seisina de
petitis, ex praecepto vicecomitis ponat dictus Balliuus petentem in huiusmodi
seisinam, nec oportet ipsum petentem quaerere aliud breue ad hoc faciendum.
Quia vicecomes ex iudicio comitatus in hoc casu naturam and tenorem tam parui
Cape quam magni ex officio sibi commisso habet sine breui. Ideo Iudicia
siquidem comitatus pronunciari debent per aliquem Sectatorem ipsius comitatus.
Et cum aliquotiens euenit, quod quis queratur domino Regi de falso iudicio
reddito in ipso Comitatu, non intelligatur, si comperiatur ipsum iudicium
falsum esse, quod vicecomes inde puniri debet, immo comitatus, id est
communitas comitatus, vnde expedit huiusmod: sectatoribus tale respondere quale
pro iusto potetint aduocare. Si autem vicecomes possit reddere huiusmodi
iudicium, quandoque pretextu lucri, vel causa ignorantiae deuiaret, quod si sic
faceret, indebitum esset and iniquum al. sectatoribus.
prosequentibus huiusmodi causam impingere. Et alia subest causa. Sunt n.
nonnulli vicecomites adeo simplices quod non habeant vnde respondere possint de
misericordia assignata quando convincentur de tali iudicio in curia. Et ideo
statuitur quod totus Comitatus reddat iudicium. Caueant nunc de unjust
procedere. Semper intelligendum est quod quaelibet summonitio fieri debet per
bonos summonitores. Videamus ergo quid and quale sit officium summonitorum.

CAP. V. De officio summonitorum. Lex vadiata. Essonia,
CVm ordo placitandi in Curia Baronis and Comitatu per breue domini Regis de
recto superius in part exprimatur, nunc cum huiusmodi loquela in pleno
comitatu per breue quod vocatur Pone adiornata fuerit in Bancum, opus est
docere quomodo ipsi petens and tenens de caetero debent procedere. Cursorium
est autem, quod quando cunque petens fecerit defaltam, tenens eat quietus sine
die. Et tam petens quam plegij sui de prosequendo in misericordia. Et ideo de
tenente and eius defensionibus loquamur. Primo de placito atterminato ad Bancu^
foris Comitatum per Pone. In primo die potest petens essoniari de malo veniendi
ab initio and gaudere eodem essonio, sed non decet propriam commoditatem
differ. Duo boni summonitores adibunt tenentem dicendo sic. Nos A. and B.
summonemus te quod sis tali die apud London, cora^ Iustitiarijs de Banco
responsurus tali de tanto terrae cum pertinentijs in N. and specificare debent
quantitatem. In iudicando autem essonio semper respicienda sunt breuia
originalia and status placitorum, ne forte per iterationem essonij nimis
differatur petitio petentis seu per machinosam cautelam prosequentis aliquid
huiusmodi essonium. sed si tale essonium irritum fuerit convertatur in
defaltam. Et ideo Iustitiarij sic faciunt ad euitandum periculum and errorem.
Et si summonitores non faciunt officium suum vt praedictum est, tunc non
conceditur secundum legem terrae. Et hoc idem dico, quod si summonitio non sit
secundum legem terrae post terram captam in manum Domini Regis, replegiare eam
potest reus and omnino disaduocando omnia essonia cuiuscunque generis vel
naturae fuerint and defendere summonitionem sic. Sire defaute ne poye ieo fere.
Car ie ne su pas somons selounley de terre. and ceo suy pressed afere quant ke
cest Court agard que fere deueroye. Et tunc debent summonitores, si sint boni,
esse praesentes ad testificandum summonitionem suam. Et nisi se representent ad
testificandam summonitione^, licet illam decenter fecerint non sunt boni
summonitores. Et tunc adiudicabitur reus ad legem suam XII. manu quam facere
potest secure, si non sit summonitus secundum legem ter^ae. Et haec est cautela
necessaria. Et si summonitores sint boni, adhuc dico potest reus esse ad legem
contra eos, licet falso. Et summonitores non portant recordu^ in hoc causa ad
destruendum legem Rei. Ista autem vltima lex potest vadiari ad saluandu^
autumnalia aut Redditu^ assisum. Et potest reus retrahere se de lege and esse
in misericordia, and autumnalia lucrari. In omnibus autem curijs and singulis
placitis potest fieri haec cautela. Qui rite summonent and eandem summonitionem
testantur, vocantur boni summonitores per legem ter^ae and non aliter. Licet
vero praesentia tenentis ex consuetudine regni debet in curia domini Regis
vsque ad quartum diem expectari, infra quam tenens non adiudicabitur pro
defalta, caveat tamen tenens quod essonium suum primo die iaceatur, aut
calumniari potest and in defaltam reduci. Attamen secundo die possunt aliquando
essonia intrari in rotulo; quanquam ex gratia Iustitiariorum quandoque propter
nimictatem essoniorum primo die non possunt intrari.

CAP. VI. Modus essoniandi and reddendi essonia and dies communes in breui de
Recto. Essoniatores. Atturnati.
MOdus essoniandi talis est. Talis versus talem de placito terrae per talem.
and sic irrotulabitur. Modus reddendi essoniorum talis est. Dicat Praenotarius
clamatori. Exige essoniatorem Richardi le Iay. respondeat es^oniator. Ecce
Adsum. Irerum Praenotariu vbi est W. Husse, ac si diceret, petens, qui
similiter dicat ecce adsum. Tu essoniator Richardi affida habendi hic warrantum
tuum a die sancti Michaelis in XV. dies, and tu Willielme serua eundem diem.
Affidatis in manibus vel super virgam clamatoris recedant vtrique si velint.
Potest autem tenens essoniatus, ante redditionem essonij, apparere si voluerit,
and respondere petenti si voluerit. Et si ipse tenens inuentus fuerit iuxta
lege placit^.
plebiscitum, antequam reddatur essonium ad calumniam petentis, coercetur
respondere petenti, velit nolit, de de capitali placito. Et sic per propriam
fatuitatem posset in prima tali apparitione amittere dilationes statutas. Sunt
etiam dies communes dati, ex consuetudine regni, in omnibus placitis secundum
diuersitatem naturarum breuium. In hoc autem breui de recto generaliter dentur
duo dies per annum tantum. Et ratio quare in isto breui assignatur pauciores
dies per annum quam in alijs breuibus; quia de quovis potes dissilire ad istud,
and non econverso. Istud n. stirps est alijs, ita quod quicquid per ipsum rita
determinatione concluditur stat imperpetuu^. Et ideo per hanc moderatam
dilationem parcitur tenenti. Curia namque domini Regis neminem vult decipere.
De diebus omnibus in hoc breui sic distinguo. si breue primo venerit ad festum
Sancti Michaelis de Octabis and Quindena Sancti Michaelis adiornetur a die
Paschae in XV. dies. De tertia septimana, in III. septimanas Paschae, De mense
in mensem, and quinta septimana in quintam septimanam. De in Crastino Animarum
in Crastinum Ascensionis domini. De crastino Sancti Martini in crastinu^
Sanctae Trinitatis, de quindena Sancti Martini in quindenam Sanctae Trinitatis,
vltra quod quindenam Sancti Martini in hoc termino non recipietur breue. Et si
breue venerit ad terminum Sancti Hillarij hoc ordine respondeat ei terminus
Sancti Iohannis Baptistae and econverso. Pascha n. Sanctus Michael, Johannes
and Hilarious in hac regula convertibiliter se habent in omnibus breuibus and
placitis. Essoniator autem, absente vel praesente aduersario suo, tantu^ potest
facere quantum Attornatus omni die, nisi eo die quo oportuerit parts litigare.
Litigare autem pro domino suo non potest essoniator. Sed si petens essoniatus
fuerit vel compareat essoniator tenentis, been potest capere diem versus ^um
adeo been sicut dominus suus vel eius atturnatus, vel si petens fecerit
defaltam idem essoniator in redditione essonij potest calumniare defaltam, and
sic per calumniam suam petens perdet breue suum, and plegij sui in
misericordia, and tenens and essoniatores quieti sine die. Et si reus deficiat
in redditione essonij petentis, reuera essoniator ille potest sequi defaltam
versus cum and habere breue de iudicio ad capiendam terram in manu^ domini
Regis per magnum Cape aut per Paruum de habenda seisina vel de attachiando seu
distringendo secundum qualitatem and diuersitatem breu^um and dierum, adeo been
sicut potest dominus suus vel eius attornatus. Aliter autem posset talis
defalta transcurrere impunita frequenter ad damnum cuiuspiam and in illusionem
regiae dignitatis. Quando autem essoniator sequitur defaltam pro domino suo vel
pro suo atturnato, certum nomen eius irrotulabitur in Rotulatione defaltae
illius, propter ita codices queis vtimur.
tenerem statum ipsius essoniatoris qui in hoc casu tam solemnis efficitur in
potestate. Quando autem atturnatus sequitur defaltam pro domino suo, non sic
fit; nisi dubitetur de fraud atturnati.

CAP. VII. De Attornatis faciendis.
POst igitur essonium redditum, potest reus apparere in Curia and facere
atturnatos. Securum est n. e^ facere duos atturnatos pro periculo infirmitatis,
seu mortis, vel etiam fraudis in quocunque statu esset lis illa. Ambo reus and
petens possunt facere atturnatos and debent fieri per haec verba. Talis ponit
loco suo talem versus talem de placito terrae. Et si prius fecerit attornatos
quos amouere voluerit* sic Et amouet tales quos prius etc. Possunt autem per
breue domini Regis de Cancellaria tam pro reo quam pro petente admitti
Attornati. Et si reus aut petens infirmentur in provincia, and non pos^unt
venire ad curiam coram Iustitiarijs, nec ad Cancellariam domini Regis ad
faciendos attornatos, cum oporteat de necessitate facientem attornatos
personaliter in Curia praesentem esse, tunc ad procurationem volentis facere
attornatos, mitt^t Cancellarius aliquem notum clericum de Cancellaria ad
infirmum coram quo faciat attornatos. Et Cancellarius quando eos recepit,
mandabit Iustitiarijs per breue domini Regis de huiusmodi attornati receptione.
Et quando dominus Rex ex gratia sua dat alicui potestatem recipiendi huiusmodi
attornatos tunc sic. Rex dilecto and fideli suo tali salutem. Sciatis quod
dedimus vobis potestatem recipiendi attornatos tales, quos loco suo atturnare
voluerit, ad lucrandum vel perdendum in loquela quae est coram Iustitiarijs
nostris apud Westmonasterium per breue nostrum, inter praefatum talem petentem
and talem tenentem de tanto terrae cum pertinentijs in N. Et ideo vobis
mandamus quod, cum Attornatos illos receperitis, de nominibus eorundem
attornatorum constare faciatis remittentes nobis hoc breue etc. Si autem petens
sieve reus languidus fuerit, potest habere breue domini Regis de attornato
faciendo sic. Rex vicecomiti salutem. Mitte quatuor legales milites de comitatu
tuo vsque N. ad F. qui languidus est ad videndum quem Idem F. loco suo
attornare voluerit ad lucrandum vel perdendum in loquela quae est in comitatu
tuo coram Iustitiarijs nostris Itinerantibus de tanto terrae cum pertinentijs
in N. and dic quatuor militibus illis quod sint coram Iustitiarijs nostris tali
die ad testificandum quem idem F. in praefata loquela loco suo attornare
voluerit etc. Iustitiarij similiter in provincia possunt recipere atturnatum
and hoc significare socijs suis per breue suum, and stabit atturnatus. Reus
autem in nullo placito quod determinari poterit per legem, non potest facere
atturnatu^ propter imprisonamentum quod subsequitur. quia non debet quis
imprisonari pro delicto alterius. Ex quo illud est personale delictum, nec per
consequens facere debet pro eo legem, nec cum reus fecerit atturnatum,
oportebit petentem se es^oniare versus illum Atturnatum, immo versus
principalem, Attornatus autem si fuerit essoniandus, semper nomine suo
es^onietur and non in nomine principalis.

CAP. VIII. Secundus dies placiti. Defaltae. Magnum Cape. Paruum cape. Non
Pleuine. Legis vadiatio.
SEcundo die placiti potest reus facere defaltam si velit ex consuetudine
regni, dum tamen essoniatus fuerit primo die ordine praemonstrato. Petens autem
expectans quartum diem ipso die offerat se liti sic versus ipsum reum in haec
verba. Richardus le Iay se profre verse William Huse de play de terre, and ils
ent iour par son essoneur iekes ore, and ceo est huy le quart magnum cape. Sed
reo deficiente postquam comparauerit in Curia, capietur terra in manum domini
Regis per paruum cape pro defectu rei qui summonebatur ad audiendum iudicium
suum and ex hoc petens consequetur seisinam de terra petita. Caveat rursus sibi
reus deficiens quod infra XV. dies terram suam captam in manum domini Regis
replegiet, quod si non fecerit, ad calumniam petenti proximo die placiti
amittet seisinam terrae, sicut per defaltam post defaltam. and per magnum cape
returnatum fiet huiusmodi probatio scilicet fiat collatio de die captionis
indorsato a retro breuis illius returnati a vicecomite, and de replegiatione.
Si districto compoto comperiatur terram non esse replegia^am infra XV. dies
post captionem, amittet seisinam per defaltam. Et de hoc seruit hoc verbu^ Et
diem captionis etc. Et ista defalta vocatur gallice Non ple^ine, and
aequipollet naturaliter defaltae post defaltam. In quibus vtrisque defaltis,
and defalta post primam summonitionem, defalta post visum, defalta post
vadiatione^ duelli, defalta post positionem in magnam assisam, defalta post
warrantum vocatum, and defalta si non miserit certu^ responsalem post
consummationem languoris, semper reus amittet seisinam. Terra siquidem capta in
manum domini Regis per visum, non potest replegiari nisi coram Iustitiarijs vel
in Cancellari^ and hoc mandabit dominus Rex Iustitiarijs per breue suum. tamen
vbicunque inv^^tus fuerit aliquis de tali officio priuilegiatus, sieve fuerit
hic coram quo dependeat placitu^ sieve alius coram quo terra sic c^pt^
replegiabitur, ille mandabit socijs suis diem replegiationis. Sed non oportet
eum in propria persona terram suam replegiare. Quilibet n. extraneus pro noto,
and econtra terram alterius potest replegiare. Sciendum est autem quod
vicecomes nequitiam in officio sibi commissam potest facere multipliciter.
verbi gratia si reo non su^monito testetur and indorset vicecomes in breui
remisso ipsum esse summonitu^, vnde magnu^ cape exiuit. and si iterum in magno
cape testetur captione^ terrae quae non capiebatur, and die^ captionis p^textu
cuiusdam fraudis, vnde dicta terra non fuit replegiata, eo quoth reus inde nihil
sciuit, and petens p^cise se capi^ ad defaltam non pleuinae. Et quid si
testetur vltimam summonitione^ quae est in le cape, reo non summonito, and
petens per defaltam recuperet seisinam, cum de iure nulla^ potuit facere
defaltam ex quo summonitus non fuit? sciendum est quod post defaltam irritare
potest per dedicere primam summonitionem per legem se XII. manu. Captio tamen,
vt sanetur defalta non pleuinae, per legem dedici non potest. Nam si reus
vellet dedicere captionem oportet prius euincere fraudem captorum dictae terrae
per visores dictae captionis. and hoc ad impedienda^ vltima^ summonitionem
contenta^ in le cape per quoth reus recuperauit seisina^ dictae terrae petitae,
non potest dedici per legem. Quia testificatum fuit die quo petens recuperauit
seisinam terrae petitae cum reus non fuerit ibidem, and licet affuisset non
expediret ei dedicere summonitionem, cum non posset respondere de capitali
placito nec posset vadiare legem de non summonitione contra summonitores qui
tunc non fuerunt ibi and sic recuperata seisina petentis reus non haberet
partem adversam cui respondere deberet nec diem placiti vnde posset aliquid
dicere vel legem vadiare. Hic nullum habetur remedium nisi dare domino Regi de
suo pro sic, quod faceret venire summonitores ad attingendum huiusmodi
falsitatem, and ita posset recuperare dictam terram suam. Et licet summonitores
testantur aduersus ipsum reum, secundum Henricum de Bathoria, reus potest tunc
dedicere per legem se XII. manu contra summonitores de non summonitione quam
testantur se fecisse and eorum testimonium infirmare, and licet reus perdat per
defaltam non pleuinae vel per defaltam post defaltam, habet tamen recuperare
pro hoc per breue de recto. Essonia siquidem de vltra mare de seruitio domini
Regis and malo veniendi, si terra capiatur in manum domini Regis* quod debita
hora replegietur, possunt infirmari, per dedicere primam summonitionem, and sic
de novo reincipiendum est. Et si terra capiatur in manum domini Regis and
debite replegiatur, tunc potest in apparentia rei petens essoniari.

TErtio die apparente petente, si reus essonietur proculdubio essonium illud
disallo cabile est. quia non potest reus essonium gaudere, donec prima sanetur
defalta postquam terra sua capta fuit. Et si sit essoniatus perdit seisinam
terrae vt per defaltam post defaltam. Facto autem atturnato rei sequenti die
placiti, ambo atturnatus petentis and reus essoniabuntur, atturnatus autem rei
requaquam. Si reus essonietur and atturnatus suus non vel tunc petens ad alium
diem potest calumniare es^onium illius rei, vel non. Certe secundum Henricum de
Bathonia, non. Hora enim hoc faciendi iam praeterijt. Petens autem seu
attornatus suus vel eius essoniator in redditione essonij illius potuit hoc
fecisse and allocaretur de iure. Hic autem probatur de iure quod quando que
aufertur quod differtur. licet tamen generaliter dicatur, quod differtur non
aufertur. Calumnia enim essonij proiecti die p^ambulo hodie al. locu^ non tenet
in ore pet.
devoluta in os petentis, quia expedit debitum tempus calumniandi, hodie locum
non tenet. Hic autem disputari potest quod essoniator in casu plus facere
potest quam atturnatus. Si autem vir and mulier invenia^tur in vno breui,
quemadmodum si terra petita fuerit haereditas ipsius mulieris vel data cum ea
in liberum maritagium, seu est questus illorum viri and mulieris coniunctim,
alter eorum primo die potest essoniari, and alter deficere. Congruit tamen viro
primo essoniari in hoc casu. Quid erit tunc de defalta mulieris? Terra capietur
in manum domini regis aut deerit ordo iuris. Et quid si replegietur hora
debita? Et hoc comperiatur per indorsamentum breuis vicecomitis? Die dato
essonio ipsius viri amitteturne terra petita per defaltam ipsius mulieris? Cum
habeat virum sine quo de iure coniunctim non debet respondere, Certe licet vir
praecellat mulierem generaliter, and in ore suo stet verbum mulieris, si terra
petita fuerit de haereditate ipsius mulieris, videatur quod debeat amitti. Sed
si fuerit talis terrae questus viri and mulieris coniunctim, vel si donetur cum
ea in liberum maritagium, vbi vir tantum habeat in terra illa quantum mulier
aut plus, non amittatur tunc per defaltam illam. Non enim conven^t quoth quis pro
alterius contumacia puniatur. Quid erit tunc de defalta ipsius mulieris?
Resummoneatur vna cum viro suo quod tunc sit ad alium diem. quia hic ordo de
viro primi^us essoniato Locus plerisque exempll. ^oriuptus.
in mulierem primitus essoniatam converti non potest. Caueant vir and mulier
coniunctim implacitati quod semper in essonio alterius alter compareat quamdiu
furcare possint, and, cum vltra non possint, concurrant eorum essonia in suis
locis. Alter autem illorum tantum vnum essonium de malo lecti habere potest.
Haec autem omnia dico de pluribus participibus vbi terra impertita est seu
tenementum. videlicet de furcatione essonij and de defaltis inde
prouenientibus; numerantur in part in Marlbrige cap. 14.
starutis domini Henrici Regis. Si autem plures participes fuerint in breui,
currat ordo communis. Desun quae his signis * * hinc distincta sunt, plerisque
exempll.
Et cum iste erant dilationes tempore quo ista summa erat composita vbi plures
erant participes tenentes per quos iusta petitio vltra quam debuit
prorogabatur, illustris rex Edwardu^ filius R. Henrici in primo parlamento suo
decreuit in praemissis sicut before patebit in West. 1. cap. 43
sexagesimo articulo constitutionum illarum. Essonium autem de vltra mare si
rite iaceatur semper exposcit inducias XL. dierum ad minus. Et semper debet
praecedere essonium de malo veniendi and non econtra. Tertio die placiti post
captionem terrae per defaltam quam tenens fecit die praecurso, aut tunc ipse
tenens defuit aut apparet. Sieve autem appareat sieve non ad pro^rum petentis
inspiciat praenotarius indorsamentum vicecomitis a retro breuis per quod terra
capiebatur. Et si reperiatur non esse replegiatam infra XV. dies post captionem
tunc petens offerat se liti sic Richard le Iay se proffre verse William Huse de
play de terre. A tiel iour fu la terre prise in la main le rey par sa defaut de
non pleuine de tout outre. Ita offerre se debet, si tenens fuerit praesens; and
si se teneat ad defaltam, quod secure facere potest, hoc modo* irrotulabitur

manum domini Regis and quod diem etc. and ipse suum etc. quod esset hic ad hunc
diem. Et vicecomes mandauit diem captionis and quod summonitus fuit etc. and
ideo consideratum est quod praedictus Richardus recuperet seisinam suam versus
eum per defaltam and W. in misericordia. Et si tenens suerit praelens tale erit
breue petentis de Iudicio quod vocatur Scias Rex vicecomiti salutem. scias quod
Richardus le Iay in Curia nostra coram Iustitiarijs nostris apud
Westmonasterium recuperauit seisinam sua^ versus Willielmum Huse de vna
carucata terrae cum pertinentijs in H* pro defectu ipsius Willielmi. Et ideo
tibi praecipimus quod praedicto Richardo de praedicta carucata terrae cum
pertinentijs plenariam seisinam habere facias sicut praedictum est etc. Et si
tenens defecerit post apparitionem, tunc exibit paruum cape sic. Rex vicecomiti
salutem Cape in manum nostram vnam carucatam terrae cum pertinentijs suis in N.
quam Richardus le Iay in Curia nostra coram Iustitiarijs nostris apud
Westmonasterium clamat vt ius suum versus Willielmum Huse pro defectu ipsius
Willielmi, Et summoneas per bonos summonitores praedictum Willielmum quod s^
coram Iustitiarijs nostris apud Westmonasterium tali die ad audiendum Iudicium
suum. Et habeas etc. Tunc autem ad proximum diem reo praesente petens habebit
dictum breue Sci^s per quod adiudicetur ei ^eisina. Et quid si vicecomes ad
alium diem per magnum cape non ceperit terram in manum domini Regis vt
praeceptum fuit ei, nec miserit breue ad bancum? Erit ne ipse tenens inde
perdens, aut derogabitur ne in aliquo ipsi petenti? Respondeo. Tenens ob hoc
non est puniendus. Nam licet contumax extiterit vicecomes, negligent^a
vicecomitis non debet ei impingi. Petens autem amittet vnum diem. Et cadet hac
negligentia vicecomitis in detrimentum vicecomitis sic. Rex vicecomiti salutem.
Praecipimus tibi sicut alias tibi praecipimus quod capias per visum etc. vt
supra in magno Cape and in fine sic. Et tu ipse tunc sis ibi ad audiendum
iudicium tuum de hoc quod praedictam terram in manum nostram non cepisti nec
praedictum Willielmum summonuisti quod esset coram Iustitiarijs etc. nec breue
nostrum quod inde tibi venit, praefatis iustitiarijs nostris ad praefatum diem
non misisti, sicut tibi praeceptum fuit. Et habeas etc. Terra autem post primam
vel iteratam captionem, vt moris est, replegiata, tenens potest secure
essoniari de malo lecti quod quidem essonium sic irrotulabitur. Richardus le
Iay versus Willielmum Huse de malo lecti de placito terraeper talem and talem,
et sic reddi debet. exige essoniatorem Richardi le Iay. vbi ^st Willielmus Huse
etc. vos essoniatores Richardi le Iay quia non constat vtrum dominus vester
velit se capere ad languorem necne vobis non datur certus dies. Sed tu
Willielme sequere breue ad vicecomite^ ad faciendum venire infirmum. Rex
vicecomiti salutem. Mitte quatuor legales milites de comitatu tuo vsque N. ad
F. ad videndum vtrum infirmitas qua Willielmus Huse in Curia nostra coram
Iustitiarijs nostris apud Westmonasterium se essoniauit de malo lecti versus
Richardum le Iay de placito terrae in Comitatu Sussex, sit languor ^^cne, Et si
sit languor tunc ponant ei diema die visus sui in vnum annum and vnum diem apud
Turrim London quod tunc sit ibi responsurus vel sufficientem pro se mittat
responsalem and si non sit languor tunc ponant ^i diem coram Iustitiarijs
nostris a die visus sui in XV. dies quod tunc sit ibi responsurus vel
sufficientem pro se mittat responsalem. Et dic quatuor militibus illis quod
tunc sint coram praefatis Iustitiarijs nostris ad praefatum diem ad
testificandum visum illu^ and quem diem ei posuerint. Et habeas ibi nomina
militum and hoc breue test t^li Iustitiario etc. Ex quo aute^ placitum
capitale est coram Iustitiarijs de Banco quare deb^nt visores ponere languido
diem ^^ud Turrim London cum non sedeantibi Iustitiarij? Solutio. In hoc breui
mitte quatuor legales milites sic dicitur si sit languor tunc ponant ei diem a
die visus sui in vnum annum and vnum diem, and quia milites illi non habent
certum diem videre infirmum, per consequens non potest constare quem diem
praefigent languido. Ergo cum constare non potest adhuc de certo die ponendo a
visoribus quia accidentaliter posset istud essonium iaci in fine vel quasi in
fine alicuius termini, sicut frequenter, and forte infirmus deberet videri tali
hora quod oporteret ei praesigere diem tempore vacationis; Et in vacationibus
nullus in Banco residet priuilegiatus quod possit vel debeat admittere
responsalem languidi cum surrexerit; Ideo ad Turrim London vt dictum est
adiornetur languidus respondere coram Constabulario Turris London qui ibi
residet per totum annum qui ipsum languidum adiornabit quod respondeat coram
Iustitiarijs de Banco proximo die placiti. Et idem Constabularius testificari
debet coram Iustitiarijs in Banco praesente languido, vel responsali suo. Et
quid si languidus ille, die a visoribus praefixo ad Turrim non venerit nec
responsalem miserit? Hoc reuera testificato coram Iustitiarijs in Banco ab ipso
Constabulario, ad profrum petentis reus ex rigore iuris amittet seisinam hoc
modo. Richard le Iay se proffre verse William Huse de play de terre. William se
fist essonier de mal de lyt a teu iour per cely e cely. Richard suist un brief
an viscont a fere le veu de IV. cheualers de count les queux le virent e iour
assisserent per languor quil prist a la Tou^ de Londres soloun le usage d'
Engleterre. Eil ne vent pase ceo est bien testmoigne per le Constable de la
tour que en ceo case port record and testmoignage, d' ont nous demandons
Judgment de se defaute tout outre. Et tunc petens habebit paruum cape, ad
capiendam terram in manum domini Regis and ad summonendum reum ad audiendum
iudicium suum. Et sic recuperabit petens in hoc casu. Et licet reus comparuerit
in Curia vel in Banco in hac calumnia actoris, and non seruauerit diem ad
Turrim tunc ad consimile proffrum petens ipse recuperabit s^isinam per breue
scias propter praesentiam rei qui in absentia sua iudicari non debet. Quia cum
reus ita defecerit quod debeat seisinam amittere si praesens fuerit exibit
scias, si absens, paruum Cape. Istud autem essonium de malo lecti non iacet
nisi in hoc breui patenti vel clauso scilicet praecipe in capite. Tamen
secundum Henricum de Bathonia iacet in breui de consuetudinibus and seruicijs
and post vadiationem duelli vel positionem in magnam assisam and non ante. Si
sorores tres vel quatuor vel plures vel pauciores reae efficiantur coniunctim,
Hae omnes gaudere possunt hoc essonio tamen vna tantu^ pro singulis capiat
languorem. Ex quo tunc generaliter oportet quod duo essoniatores ^aceant hoc
essonium pro vnico reo, and istae quatuor sorores vide^turesse quasi quatuor
reae, quaero si sigillatim per duos essoniatores debent hoc essonium i^ctari
pro illis? Solutio. Ius permittet vnam pro se and reliquis sororibus languere
ad cuius languorem cessabit placitum versus sorores accomplices vsque ad diem a
visoribus p^fixum. Ergo cum per languorem vnius, reliquae in hoc casu excusari
possunt, Quae nam illarum debet capere languorem? Et primitus equidem visa a
militibus languebit* Et quid si disgregentur? id est si inventae non fuerint in
vna villa, and prima secunda and tertia velint surgere, tunc quarta vltimo visa
a militibus capiet languorem. Dico autem per languorem vltimo visae cessabit
placitum ac si omnes concordarent. In fine autem languoris, an ista languida si
appareat die a visoribus praefixo, debeat ne pro se and alijs respondere? vel
responsalem mittere, ita quod in ore aliarum sororum responsio non iacet? in
hoc casu, si praesens fuerit languida, dico quod opor^et illas comparere. Et
quic quid respondebit illa quae languebat tenebitur pro constanti. Et si
miserit responsalem, aliae sorores been possunt absentare. Esto tunc quod per
collusionem inter petentem and languidam vel responsalem eius habitam,
recognoscatur ius petentis in respondendo ad exhaeredacionem trium sororum
huiusmodi per cuius recognitionem petens recuperet seisina^. hic nisi per
remedium Curiae attingatur illa collusio and Curiae deceptio, ad restitutionem
trium sororum huiusmodi nullum habetur recuperare nisi per breue de recto.
Quicquid autem dico de sororibus iunctis in vno breui, dico de viro and muliere
coniunctis and de participibus vbi terra impertita est. Die autem praefixo
tenenti a visoribus, debent visores apparere in Curia ad testificandum visum
suum, quia ex eorum testimonio procedendum est. Videlicet si testentur se
vidisse infirmum tali die, and per districtum compotum liqueat tunc infirmum
illum misisse responsalem suum die ab eis visoribus praefixo, de quibus visu
and responsali ita in Curia computandum est vt supra in capitulo de Ordine
placitandi in Curia Baronis, penitus liquet quod admittendus est responsalis
eiusdem. Et si non venerit tenens nec responsalem miserit, and hoc testificato
a visoribus and comperto per certum compotum quod non seruauit diem ab eisdem
praefixum vt suprascribitur, offerat se petens and obtinebit seisinam per
paruum Cape vel per scias. Et ad proffrum petentis calumniantis defaltam rei,
sic intrabitur defalta illa. Richardus le Iay petit versus Willielmum Huse vnam
carucatam terrae cum pertinentijs in H. vt ius suum etc. and alias se
essoniauit de malo veniendi scilicet tunc, and habuit diem per essonium suum in
Octabis etc. ad quem diem W. essoniauit se de malo lecti, ita quod praeceptum
fuit vicecomiti quod mitteret quatuor legales milites apud etc. ad videndum
vtrum infirmitas etc. esset languor vel non. Et si esset languor tunc ponerent
ei diem a die visus sui in vnum annum and vnum diem apud Turrim London apud
tunc esset ibi vel per se vel per sufficientem responsalem etc. Et si non esset
languor, tunc ponerent ci diem hic etc. vel sufficientem etc. Et Willielmus non
venit nec responsalem ^isit. Ideo consideratum est quoth praedictus Ricardus
recuperet seisinam suam versus eum per defaltam ipsius W. and ipse in
misericordia, and praedictus Richardus sequatur breue suum ad vicecomitem* Et
quid si Willielmus non compareret per se vel per attornatum suum secundo saltem
die sibi dato per essoniatores suos? tunc post essonium de malo lecti procul
dubio petens secure and praecise se capiet ad defaltam illam sic dicens.
Willielmus fecit defaltam primo die placiti eo quod solemniter vocatus non
comparuit, vnde idem petens petit iudicium de defalta rei praecise. Re^s tamen
replicando requirere debet a petente vtrum velit se tenere praecise ad defaltam
illam vel ad capitale placitum. Oportet quod si se teneat ad defaltam illam
quod de toto renunciet capitali placito et eco^verso. Nam inconsu^tum est quod
quis in Curia domini Regis duplici remedio sieve baculo in vno casu simul and
semel gaudeat sieve pugnet. Si autem petens requisitus se teneat ad defaltam
illam praecise, reus potest sic dicere, quoth nullam fecit defaltam, quod venit ad
Bancum primo die placiti, and obtulit se versus praedictum petentem de placito
praedicto and ibi morabatur quousque publico proclamatum fuit per seruientem de
Banco quod omnes offerentes s^ ibidem ad placitandum de quibuscunque placitis,
exceptis placitis vnde magna assisa arramiata fuit, vel duellum vadiatum, sine
occasion reced^rent in crastinum. Et dicit quod si solemniter vocatus fuerit
per serui^nte^ de Banco hoc fuit postquam clamatum fuit sicut praedictum est.
Ista siquidem allegatio super hac defalta peni^us depende^a Recordo
I^stitiarioru^. Et si I^stitiarij recordarentur ipsum (...) vt dictum est
public clamasse proff^um in Banco, Reus eat inde sine die and petens amittet
clamium illa vice and tenens in misericordia. quia praecise se tenuit ad
defaltam. Et si Iustitiarij recordarentur quoth non fuit public clamatum proff^um
in Banco sicut praedictum est, and qu^d omnibus horis primi diei placiti v^que
ad horam nonam praedictus reus solemni^er vocatus non comparuit nec
sufficientem pro se misit responsalem, consideratum est quod praedictus petens
recuperet seisinam versus eum per defaltam, and tenens in misericordia.
Sequatur autem petens breue suum. Caveat autem calumniator huius defaltae quod
sit certus de recordo Iustitiariorum in hoc casu. In defalta quoque post
essonium de malo lecti, post visum terrae factum, post positionem in magnam
assisam and post vadiationem duelli, reus amittet seisinam per absentiam primi
diei. Si visores illi non venerint ad testificandu^ visum suum, quid erit?
semper distringantur donec venerint. Primo per vadios and saluos plegios sic.
Rex vice comiti salutem. Pone per vadios, and saluos plegios A.B.C.D. visores
infirmitatis talis quod sint coram Iustitiarijs nostris, etc. ad testificandum
etc. Quare autem debent primo attachiari cum non summoneantur vt videtur? quia
in hoc breui Mitte quatuor legales milites etc. continetur versus finem istud
verbum quoth vilet summoneas; Et dic quatuor militibus illis qui visui illi
interfuerint quod sint etc. Et sic licet pateat quod non summoneantur, sunt
quasi summoniti. Et ideo primo attachiantur per plegios ratione illius verbi in
breui contenti scilicet and dic. Secundo si Non venerint ad prosecutionem
petentis, sic. Rex vicecomiti, salutem. Pone per vadios and meliores plegios
A.B. C.D. etc. Et tunc sunt primi plegij in misericordia. Tertio per corpora
eorum; Et tunc sunt tam primi plegij quam secundi in misericordia. Quarto per
terras and catalla, ita quod vicecomes habeat corpora and quod manum non
apponant, and quod vicecomes respondeat de exitibus, and interim taceat tenens.
Si autem tenens ad diem sibi datum a visoribus non venerit personaliter sed
responsalem pro se miserit, admittendus est and eius responsalis audiendus
quicunque fuerit responsalis ille, dummodo aetatem habuerit. veruntamen si
determinatiue respondeat, vtpote si debeat iudicium fieri and loquela
terminari, vt de duello vadiato vel de magna assisa summonita, vel aliquo alio
modo vnde loquela debeat terminari^ Tunc debet iudicium illud poni in respectu
quousque per milites de nouo missos per breue domini Regis ad tenentem sciatur
ab eo si aduocauerit responsalem suum praedictum an non. Quod si non fecerit
reuertantur illi quatuor milites and id testentur coram Iustitiarijs de Banco
and tunc procedendum est eodem modo ac si reus personaliter comparuisset and
respondisset. Et si negauerit responsalem and eius responsum dedixerit, tunc
erit manifesta defalta rei, sicut saepe contingit, and debet ad calumniam
petentis iudicari and inde petens breue Scias habebit. Ista siquidem defalta,
sicut omnes aliae, locus in plerisque cxx. depraua^us.
per essonium de seruitio domini Regis, habito inde speciali warranto, saluari
potest. Dato siquidem quod reus omisso hoc essonio de malo lecti, in adoptione
sua erit quod appareat hodie and petat visum terrae sic. Richard le Iay se
proffre per son attorne verse William Huse, de play de terre. Dicat Willielmus
vel eius al. narrator, vt in nonnullis
atturnatus v^ies ci William encontre Richard. Ceo vous monstre Richard que ci

nisi exceptio nontenurae quae proponi debet post visum.] Nescit enim reus
petitionem petentis prius, and facto visu affirmatur breue, ita quod per
dilatoriam cassari non potest, nisi tantum per nontcnur^m. Ideo omissi^ hic
pe^^mptorijs antequam petamus visum, proponamus dilatorias quae ta^es sunt.

Excussis autem istis exceptionibus, aut tenent locum aut non. Si tenent tunc ad
praesens consumitur breue. nec oporter tunc plus facere, si non teneant locum,
nisi petere visum. De visu petendo l^ quimur sic. Tort and force defend W. que
cy est and demand view de la terre ore apermeismes. Concedetur, and
irrotulabitur sic. Richardus le Iay petit versus Will. Huse vnam carucatam
terrae cum pertinentijs in H. vt ius suum, and Willielmus venit and petit inde
visum and habeat; dies datus est ei and ^iat visus per hoc breue. Rex
vicecomiti salutem. Praecipimus tibi quod sine dilatione habere facias
Willielmo Huse visum de vna carucata terrae cum pertinentijs in H. quam
Richardus le Iay in curia nostra coram Iustitiarijs nostris apud
Westmonasterium clamat vt ius suum versus eum. and dicas quatuor militibus
illis qui visui illi interfuerunt quod sint coram praefatis Iustitiarijs
nostris apud Westmonasterium tali die, ad testificandum visum illum, and habeas
ibi nomina militum, etc. Opus est amodo exprimere in quibus casibus potest
denegari visus terrae and in quibus non. Videlicet quantu^ ad hoc breue and
consimilia. Constat quod in hoc breue et in alijs breuibus per quae potest
de^^niri ad duellum vel ad magnam assisam, vi^us generaliter iacet, si petatur
ante duel^i vadiationem, vel positionem in magnam assisam, tamen si plures
fuerin^ tenentes successiue, per vocationem ad warrantiam, nullus habebit visum
nisi primus tenens. and quomodo potest tam primus tenens quam ^uccessiuus
vocati visum amittere? sic. A. petit versus B. vnam carucatam terrae cum
pertinentijs etc. vt ius suum, and B. venit and vocat inde ad warrantiam C. qui
summonitus venit, and ante quam warrantizat vel post petit visum. Non iacet
reuera. Quia cum inculpauerit C. sic A tort ly deforce par sa garantie etc.
Iuris ordo vult quod respondeat ad ca^^am suam vel ad cart^m antecessorum
^uorum, si in carta illa specificatur terrae illa petita. Et licet vocator non
habuerit cartam, vocatus debet been scire de qua terra cepit homagium and
seruitium vocantis. vnde cum warrantizauerit, petens petit eandem terram quam
warrantizauit, and ideo non iacet visus. Et illud idem dicendum est de december
tenentibus si de warranto in warrantum fierent tenentes. Campiones tamen si ad
duellum vel ad magnam assisam peruenerint habeant visum post duelli vadiationem
vel positionem in magnam assisam. Et dicctur eis quoth infra diem sibi dictam,
terram illam videant and hoc pro sacromento suo quod facient secundum quod
perpendi potest in forma sacramenti eorundem. Et possunt quidam casus accidere
de campionibus in quibus denegabitur eis visus terrae. De visu quidem habendo
in placitis intrusionis, dotis, and huiusmodi suis locis tractabitur inferius.
Generaliter autem intellige quod vbi tenens potest vocare ad warrantiam, potest
habere visum, nisi fuerint in casibus quibusdam specialiter exceptis vt
fimulier petat dotem petens non habeat visum de tenementis vnde vir obijt
seisitus, tamen potest vocare ad warrantiam and in breuibus de ingressu vbi fit
mentio de gradibus ibi conceditur visus. variatim se habent hic codd. mss.
veruntamen non potest ibi vocare ad warrantiam extra lineam sed tantum
respondere ad ingressum. and potest aliquando haberi visus vbi non potest
vocari ad warrantiam vt in breui quod permittat. Periculum est autem ante visum
vocare ad warrantiam, verbi gratia. Quidam petijt versus quendam vnam carucatam
terrae cum pertinentijs in H. and tenens ille habuit duas carucatas in eadem
villa, petens vero non habuit ius nec ad vnam nec ad aliam. Ipse tenens cum non
potuit esse certus quid ab eo peteretur, ante quam visus inde sibi fieret,
venit ante quam visum petijt and vocat inde ad warrantiam C. qui summonitus
fuit, venit et petijt sibi ostendi per quoth debeat ei warrantizare qui protulit
quanda^ cartam per quam antecessores ipsius C. and haeredes sui debeant
warrantizare vnam carucatam terrae in ^adem villa and petens dicit quod non
pe^^t dictam carucatam terrae sed aliam, and tenens cum hoc vidit voluit
respondisse de capitali placito and petens petit iudicium si, post warrantum
vocatum, possit tenens respondere de capitali placito, and consideratum fuit
quod non, Sed quod ille quietus de warrantia, and quod petens recuperet
seisinam suam versus tenentem tanquam inde^ensum and tenens in misericordia.

CAP. XI. Quartus dies placiti. E^^onium de seruicio domini Regis.
QVarto die, remisso per vicecomitem breui, per quod visus terrae factus ^uit,
actore se liti offerente, praenotarius inspiciat indorsamentum breuis
vicecomitis; and si reperiatur per nomina militum qui visui interfuerunt quod
visus terrae factus fuit, tunc ad proffrum petentis clamabitur reus qui die
illo just si velit es^oniari potest de malo veniendi, quoth quidem es^onium iaci
and reddi debet quemadmodum superius est expressum. Et quid si habita
collusione inter tenentem and vicecomitem visus terrae factus non fuerit nec
bre^e remissum? proculdubio ita procedendum est erga vicecomitem in hoc ^asu vt
superius distinguitur, quando vicecomes per coli^sionem omitt^t exequi magnum
cape, nec ibi nec hic propter negligentiam vicecomitis r^us debet puniri, nec
petens promoueri. Esto autem quod reus nullo modo venerit ad hunc diem* quid
iuris? petens offerat se liti. Richard le Iay s^ prof^re verse William Huse de
play de terre. William auoit view de terre a teu iour, e la view est
testmoniage per les quatre chiualers queux a la view fuerente il ne vient pas,
d'out nes demand^mous judgment de sa default. Quae de^alta sic intrabitur.
Richardus le Iay obtulit se quarto die versus Willielm Huse, de placito vnius
carucatae terrae cum pertinentijs in H^qua^ clamat vt ius sunm versus eum and
Willielmus petit visum terrae a die etc. and habuit diem hic post visum terrae
factum ad hunc diem and per quatuor milites qui visui illi interfuerunt,
testificatur hic nunc. and praedictus Willielmus non venit, and ideo
consideratum est quod praedicta terra capiatur in manum domini Regis and ipse
summoneatur quod sit hic tali die ad audiendum iudicium suum. and tunc exibit
paruum cape quod supra scribitur. Et sciendum quod isto die and alijs diebus
praeteritis and futuris, absentia rei saluari potest vt p^dictum est, dum tamen
reus ille excusetur per essonium de seruitio domini Regis, and inde praetendat
tale breue. Rex Iustitiarijs suis de Banco, salutem. Sciatis quod Willielmus de
H. fuit coram nobis tali die apud N. per praeceptum nostrum ita quod eo die
interesse non potuit loquelae quae est cora^ vobis per breue nostrum de recto
inter R. petentem and ipsum Willielmum tenentem de vna carucata terrae cum
pertinentijs in H. and ideo vobis mandamus quod praedictus Willielmus propter
absentiam suam illius diei non ponatur in defaltam, nec in aliquo sit perdens,
quia diem illum quoad hoc ei warrantizamus etc. Dato siquidem quod reus
sequendo huiusmodi praedictum breue defecerit die ei dato de breui illo post
visum terrae factu^, gratia dilationis faciendae, quid hoc proficeret ei? Ex
quo autem vt de plano constat, possit prorogari huiusmodi loquela de vno
termino in aliam and in casu lucrari autumnalia aut redditus assisus aut
vtrunque and petens possit interim decedere, and sic breue and processus
irruentur de toto, ideo, quia cauti sunt homines, frequenter fit talis dilatio
ex lege and principis beneficio.

CAP. XII. Quintus dies placiti. Capere languorem semel tantum licet.
QVinto die placiti, postquam reus essoniatus fuerit de malo veniendi post
visum terrae factum, si reus ille hoc die sibi dato per essonium, nullo modo
venerit, quid iuris? Petens se offerat liti sic. Richard le Iay se proffre verse
William Huse de play de terre. William fust essoin a teu iour puis veu de terre
fete, and auoit iour ieskes ore and il ne vient pas, d'unt nus demandomous
judgment de sa defaute. Ista siquidem defalta aperta est per quam petens
recuperauit seisinam, and sic irrotulabitur. Richardus le Iay optulit se IV.
die versus W. de Huse per talem de placito vnius carucatae terrae cum
pertinentijs in N. quam clamat vt ius suum versus cum. Et ipse non venit, and
habuit diem per essonium suum postquam comparuit in Curia and petijt visum
terrae. Iudicium. praedicta terra capiatur in manum domini Regis, and ipse
summoneatur quod hic sic tali die ad audiendum iudicium suum, and tunc exibit
paruum cape pro petente. Ex quo autem in iure permittitu^ quod in placito
terrae, vbi agatur de proprietate recti, vt in hoc breui and suis branchijs,
post essonium de malo veniendi generaliter sequitur essonium de malo lecti, per
hanc regulam, cum ante visum terrae (vt supra in capitulo de IV. die) per idem
essonium caeperit languorem, tamen intelligatur quod languor captus sit
commoditas and exitus essonij de malo locti in litis prorogatione, Quid iuris?
Regula data, quod post es^onium de malo veniendi generaliter subsequitur
es^onium de malo lecti semper se tenet, sed semel potest reus tantum capere
languorem and nonplus, and si reus essoni^t se hodie de malo lecti and prius
cep^rit languorem, d^bitur ei dies per es^onium suum ad proximum diem placiti,
and omittentur mi^tendi quatuor milite^, qu^a non p^^est r^us capere languorem
p^^squam semel. and qui^ reus aliter, vt dictum est, vt sentio, non potest
dedicere demandam petentis quantum ad hunc diem, nisi aliquis respondeat,
transeat per hoc essonium hodie and die sequenti. Ad alia decurramus.

CAP. XIII. Sextus dies placiti. Uoucher. Recovery and counterpleas sur ceo.
Uoucher d'enfant. Warrantia ex Dedi. ex homagio and seruicijs receptis. Age.
SExto die placiti si reus se essonians de malo lecti defecerit, currat lex
communis contra eum sicut faciendum tertio die vt superius quando fecit
defaltam post languorem. si autem reus appareat hodie, quid faciendum est? Si
habeat warrantum est ne bonum quod vocet hodie vel non? Distinguendum est. Si
iste reus ita recenter feoffatus fuerit vel antecessor eius ab ipso warranto
vel antecessore suo qui nihil sciat vel possit dicere a se ipso contra
tenentem, vt per quietum clamium vel huiu^modi, Tunc vocet hodie ad warrantiam
si quem habuerit. Sed si aliquid actum fuerit inter ipsum reum and petentem vel
antecessores eorum per quod pete^s excludi debet ab action sua id proponat
tenens vtpote si habet quietum clameum ab ipso petente, vel si alias in Curia
lis decidatur per aliquem finem inter eos, vel quod non possit respondere sine
participibus, vel qood non teneat totam terram petitam, si ita sit and alia
similia bonum est proponere antequam vocet ad warrantiam. Si autem reus vocare
voluerit ad warrantiam cum petens loquutus fuerit per verba curiae. reus
defendet vim and iniuriam and dicet. Ieo vouche a garrant per aid de cest court
B. and dicit hoc verbum per l'aid de cest court quia vocator non potest facere
vocatum venire ad Curiam autoritate sua propria and tunc petens habebit hoc
breue ad faciendum warrantum venire. Rex vicecomiti salute^. Summon^as per
bonos summonitores B. quoth sit cora^ Iustitiarijs uostris apud Westmonasterium
tali die ad warrantizandum W. vnam carucatam terrae cum pertinentijs in H. quam
Richardus le Iay in Curia nostra coram Iustitiarijs nostris clamat vt ius suum
versus praedictum W. and vnde idem W. in eadem curia nostra vocat praedictum B.
ad warrantu^ versus eum, and habeas ibi summonitores and hoc breue. Ad quem
diem tenens potest essoniari de malo veniendi sic. W. qui vocat B. ad warrantum
versus Richardum le Iay de placito terrae per talem. Warrantus autem vocatus
appareat sed nihil faciendum eo die quia non habet partem adversam, licet
principaliter sequitur essonium illud, and tunc reddat essonium tenentis.
dabitur petenti idem dies vt essoniatori and consimiliter; warranto vocato vnus
and idem dies. Ad quem diem warrantus potest essoniari de malo veniendi, sic.
B. quem W. vocat ad warrantum versus R. de placito terrae per talem. quo die
tenens non appareat sed dabitur sibi and petenti and essoniatori vocati vnus
and idem dies. Nec plus fiat illo die quia primus tenens iam substituit sibi
alium tenentem per vocationem suam. Dato autem die per illud essonium potestne
warrantus essoniari de malo lecti necne? de caetero non potest, nisi post
vadiationem duelli vel positionem in magnam assisam. Vocatio autem ad warrantum
sic debet irrotulari. Richardus le Iay petit versus W. de Huse vnam carucatam
terrae cum pertinentijs in H. vt ius suum etc. and Willielmus venit and vocat
inde ad warrantum per auxilium Curiae B. and habuit dient etc. and si B.
vocatus venerit and vocat alium tunc sic. Richardus petit versus B. quem W.
vocat ad warrantum et qui ei warrantizet vnam carucatam terrae etc. vt ius suum
etc. and quotquot fuerint warranti vocati, tot successiue essonia iactari
debent. Et primus reus post singulorum apparitionem semper potest essoniari de
malo veniendi; si autem warrantus defecerit post essonium, capiatur de terra
ipsius ad valentiam in manum domini Regis per magnum cape. Rex vicecomiti
salutem, Cape in manum nostram per visum legalium hominum etc. de terra B. ad
valentium vnius carucatae terrae cum pertinentijs in H. quam Richardus le Iay
in Curianostra coram Iustitiarijs nostris apud Westmonasterium clamat vt ius
suum versus W. Huse, and vnde idem W. in eadem Curia vocat praedictum B. ad
warrantum versus eum pro defectu ipsius W. and diem captionis etc. omnia vt
supra in magnum cape in prima defalta tenentis post primum essonium. haec
defalta intrabitur sic. Willielmus Huse obtulit se quarto die versus Richardum
le Iay de placito vnius carucatae terrae cum pertinentijs in H. quam Richardus
le Iay in Curia nostra coram Iustitiariijs nostris apud westmonasterium clamat
vt ius suum versus eum. and ipse non venit. and habuit diem per essonium suum
vt supra. Iudicium. de terra praedicti Richardi capiatur in manum domini Regis
ad valentiam etc. ad quem diem si warrantus defecerit Richardus recuperabit
seisinam versus eundem W. and W. versus B. per equipollentiam statim and sine
difficultate per Scias, and hoc erit de pluribus warrantis vocatis successiue.
Si primus vocatus defecerit petens per defaltam recuperabit seisinam suam
versus primum tenentem and primus tenens versus primum vocatum and ille versus
secundum and sic de singulis. Warrantus autem vocatus potest per exceptiones
diuersas derogare ius petentis, sicut and tenens and ponere se in magnam
assisam, vel defendere ius suum per duellum in omni euentu, sieve determinare
negotium per diuersas responsiones, vtpote per finem in Curia domini Regis
finem duelli, per quietam clamiam factam, exceptionem Bastardiae, and
consimilia quatenus viderit expedire. Esto quod reus vocet ad warrantiam and
reo essoniato, appareat warrantus, dico quoth warrantus non potest intrare in
warrantia sine suo vocatore, and sic per essonium ipsius rei dabitur dies ipsi
vocato. ad quem diem apparente vocatore ille vocatus facit defaltam. Quid
iuris? Petens autem dico sequetur defaltam illam. versus quem? Certe versus
vocatum ad warrantiam and non versus vocatorem. Quia vocator vbi and quando
debuit vocauit and post vocationem suam essonium habuit, and die sibi dato
debite comparuit, vnde constat quod nullus deliquit nisi vocatus ad warrantiam.
Quaero tunc cuius naturae debeat esse defalta. vtrum debeat exequi per magnum
cape aut per paruum per paruum cape fiat huiusmodi executio, non pro eo quod
vocatus intrauit in Curiam sine responsione facienda (vt praedictum est in
warrantia intrare non potest sine suo vocatore.) Sed quod die sibi dato in
essonium vocatoris defecerit praecise. Et ideo exeat super ipsum paruum cape
pro vocatore and petens recuperabit seisinam versus eum de petitis. Et sciendum
quod vocatus non potest habere vi^um terrae quod debet been scire vnde vocatur
ad warrantiam. Et generaliter accidit quod vocator prius habet visum. Caveat
rursus is qui vocat ad warrantiam quod non vocet minorem; nisi habeat cartam de
feoffamento in manibus per quam vocat. Quod si non fecerit amittit pro se and
haeredibus suis seisinam imperpetuum. Tamen ex officio suo Iusticiarij possunt
sibi facere gratiam si voluerint. Quum autem supradictum est quod essonium de
malo veniendi generaliter sequitur essonium de malo lecti; inde quaero si
vocatus ad warrantiam postquam essoniatus fuerit primo die de malo veniendi
possit se essoniare de malo lecti. Consequenter non potest, antequa^
warrantizet sed post potest. Esto quod duae sorores tanquam vnus haeres, vna
videlicet mayor and altera minor vocentur ad warrantiam. quid iuris? appareant
ambae in Curia and minor se alleget esse infra aetatem and petat custodem and
habebit. mayor autem non respondebit, sine sorore minori. Et remanebit loquela
illa sine die vsque ad aetatem minoris praedictae. Et cum minor mayor fuerit,
resummoneatur loquela in eodem statu in quo dimissa fuit. Idem dico de
quibuslibet participibus terrarum, de quibus quidam sunt minores and quidam
maiores. Ex iuris ordine siquidem habemus quod minor non habet legem, id est
quod non potest facere legem. and hoc sequitur quod non habet essonium de malo
veniendi, nec per consequens de malo lecti. Quid erit tunc cum aliquis minor
implacitetur, possit gaudere huiusmodi essonio an non? si minor ille feoffatus
fuerit infra aetatem, sieve reus sit, si^e per reum vocatus ad warrantiam, ad
euitandum dilationes suas non amittat propter teneritatem aetatis suae quia per
feoffamentum iam efficitur mayor in hoc casu and habeat essonia sua supradicta.
Quum autem ple^ique sentiunt minus instructi in legibus terrarum quod warrantia
non iacet in Chartis, vbi haec clausula Ego et haeredes mei warrantizabimus non
in^erituro, pus est inde certitudinem exponere. In qualibet simplici charta de
feoffamento per hoc verbum dedi quamuis plus de warrantia nonspecificatur,
tenetur donator vel eius haeres warrantizare si ad horam vocati fuerint, nisi
in feoffamento i. in carta aliquod speciale huic contrarium apponatur. Sic
contigit inter A. and B. coram R. de Thurkelby vnde postea fuit duellum
vadiatum and arrainatum. Non autem dico quod assignati donatoris debeant per
illud verbum dedi warra^tizare huiusmodi feoffato; nisi specificetur in charta
donatoris, quod ille and haeredes and assignati sui debeant warrantizare. verbi
gratia. Si huiusmodi donator antequam feoffasset istum qui modo vocat ad
warrantiam habuisset tres acras terrae, de quibus vnam dedit isti de quo loquor
and postea residuas duas C. vel D. nulla mentione facta in carta primi feoffati
quod assignati dicti donatoris debeant warra^tizare. licet, dico, tertia acra
annexa fuerit praedictis duabus acris, non ^enetur assignatus ille
warrantizare. Et quid si donator talis penitus donauerit and fuerit ita debilis
quod non habeat vnde warrantizet, cum vocatus fuerit vt saepe contingit In hoc
casu nihil scio consulere, nisi quod ille feoffatus adquirat sibi^
confirmationem a Capitali Domino si^ fieri posset. Et si capitalis dominus
illud confirmauerit and vocatus fuerit inde ad warrantiam oportet quod
warrantizet, licet non nominet donatorem. tali dico ratione. Iste capitalis
dominus de quo tenementum illud tenetur, cum se obligauerit ad hoc, per
confirmationem suam, omnia verba in dicto feoffamento contenta tam le dedi quam
le confirmaui vna cum dicto donatore simul firmat coniungens and obligans
fortiter seipsum ad pactionem tenendam dicto feoffato quasi pro defectu ipsius
donatoris. Licet autem superius in hoc capitulo dicatur quoth minor respondere non
debeat si implacitatus fuerit, nec warrantizare cum vocatus fuerit, antequam
peruenerit ad aetatem, non debeat nisi in minore aetate feoffatus fuerit, dico
in eadem aetate respondeat. In action siquidem dotis respondeat minor semper,
sieve petatur ab eo dos, sieve in dote petenda si vocatus fuerit ad warrantiam.
Sed ista lex videtur esse contraria illi quae supra scribitur quae dicit quod
minor respondere non debet donec peruenerit ad aetatem nisi in minori aetate
feoffatus fuerit. Petitio siquidem dotis non praeiudicat proprietatem iuris
haeredis a quo petitur dos. Quia cum mulier petat dotem i. tertiam partem
haereditatis, haeres ipse manifestatur, and quod ea decedente pars tertia
reuertatur ad duas, and quod hic non iacet huiusmodi exhaeredatio haeredis. Et
si mulier expectaret aetatem minoris poterit interim in fata decedere and sic
per consequens semper dotem amittere, statuitur ex iure quoth minor in hoc casu
respondeat. Si quis autem vocauerit minorem ad warrantiam non habens in promptu
cartam vel aliud per quod ipse minor si mayor es^et respondere deberet, sine
vlteriore dilatione ad calumniam minoris amittet ab eo petita. Dato siquidem
quod sorores sint participes a^icuius haereditatis de quibus vna tantum vocata
fuerit ad warrantiam quae se nihil tenere assereret nisi in propartia and
peteret iudicium desicut vocata sola fuit ad warrantiam sine participe;
Distinguendum est vltrum terra part^ta esset inter participes illas necne. Si
impertita fuerit, dicta responsio tenet locum, si vero partita and illa quae
sola vocata fuerit ad warrantiam de proparte sua receperit homagium and
seruitium vocantis, respondeo quod sine participibus respondere non debet non
habet locum, sed debet warrantizare praecise. nisi aliud de nouo proponat
versus ipsum vocantem. Adhuc autem de warrantia sic definio. Walterus petit
versus Thomam vnam carucatam terrae cum pertinentijs in H and versus R. tantum
vt ius suum, and vnde quidam B. antecessor suus fuit seisitus in dominico suo
vt de feodo and iure tempore etc. and Thomas venit and vocat inde ad warrantiam
quendam G qui praesens est and petit sibi ostendi per quod debeat ea
warrantizare and dicit quod tenet dictum tenementum de ipso G. et ei inde fecit
homagium, ita quod ipse est in seisina de homagio and similiter de seruito suo
scilicet de tali redditu assiso and similiter de secta ad Curiam suam ibi de
tribus septimanis in tres septimanas. Et prae^ictus Thomas quesitus si habeat
aliquam cartam vel instrumentum de dicto G. v^l ab antecessoribus suis per quod
teneatur praedictam terram ei warrantizare dicit quod non, and dicit quod non
debet ei warrantizare vt sibi videtur ratione homagij tantum de sicut nihil
ostendit neque cartam neque instrumentum aliquod per quod teneatur ei
warrantizare, tum quia in Cancellaria domini Regis nunquam conceditur aliquod
breue de warrantia nisi express fiat mentio quod is qui vocat ad warrantiam
habeat cartam illius quem vocat vel alicuius antecessoris ipsius, tum quia nec
praedictus Thomas nec antecessores sui inde fuerint se^siti ab eo nec ab
antecessoribus suis. Dicit enim quod quidam Richardus le Iay feoffauit quendam
Widonem auum praedictae Thomae cuius haeres ipse est de praedicto tenemento per
praedictum seruitium per annum. Et idem Richardus dedit cuidam Willielmo auo
praedicti G. cuius haeres ipse est homagium and seruicium Widonis de praedicto
tenemento ita quod idem Wido sponte and voluntate sua atturnauit se de
praedicto seruicio Willielmo, and postea descendit praedictum seruicium ipsi G.
iure haereditario, and dicit quod quando recepit homagium de praedicto Thoma
recepit illud saluo iure cuiuscunque eo quod audiuit quod Walterus qui modo
petit vendicabat ius in praedicta terra, ea ratione quod antecessores sui and
antecessores praedicti Thomae exierunt de duobus fratribus et idem Walterus
exijt de fratre antenato vt asserebat and desicut idem G. cepit homagium and
seruicium suum saluo iure vniuscuiusque, Iudicium si debeat ei warrantizare
ratione praedicti homagij tantum versus ipsum Walterum qui clamat esse
propinquior haeres de eodem stipite and eadem linea parentelae. Adhuc autem
videtur quod non debeat ei warrantizare ratione praedicti homagij tantum. Hac
ratione homagium non obligat nec excludit aliquem ab action nisi tantum
personam illius quae illud homagium receperit. verbi gratia. si quis ceperit
homagium de aliquo tenemento ratione cuius homagij excluditur quod non potest
in vita sua tenementum illud petere in dominico, and si ius haberet in eodem
haeredes sui non excluderentur ratione dicti homagij quin been possint
tenementum illud petere in dominico si voluerint. Et si idem G. warrantizaret
praedicto Thomae praedictam terram and eandem terram per considerationem Curiae
domini Regis postea amitteret versus praedictum Walterum, tunc teneretur facere
praedicto Thomae Exchambium ad valentiam praedictae terrae, absque hoc quod
idem G. nec haeredes sui aliquid possint recuperar^ versus praedictum Thomam
and haeredes suos de praedicto exchambio in perpetuum. and sic contingeret quod
haeredes ipsius G. excluderentur ab agendo de praedicto exchambio, per
praedictum homagium quod idem G. ceperit quod manifest est contra rationem
praedictam. Ex cussis quae in praesenti recoluntur quo ad vocationem warran^^
and quoad exceptiones dilatorias de peremptorijs loqui congruit isto loco. Ad
primum autem distinguendum est vtrum fuerit principalis reus aut per vocationem
substitutus qui respondere debeat, quia vtrique competunt exceptiones futurae
quae tales sunt and vigent singillatim. Praescriptio temporis probata excludit
petentem and haeredes suos ab action quae talis est in hoc breui, si dicatur
quod is de cuius seisina petit actor non fuisset in seisina rei petitae al.

disseisina. Quaeratur autoritas in primo Stat. Westmonast. cap. XLII. and in
secundo Stat. Westminster. cap. XXXII. Item nec in appello de morte hominis iacet
istud essonium vt in secundo Stat. Westminster cap. XIV. Item in quolibet placito in
quo allocatur istud essonium postquam parts descenderint in inquisitionem, non
iacet, nisi semel and hoc ad proximum diem post inquisitione^ adiudicata^. Et
post alias apparentias subsequentes non remanebit per istud essonium inquisitio
capienda. Item post diem datum prece partium non iacet istud essonium; vt in
casu quo parts concedunt venire sine essonio. Quaeratur autoritas vtriusque in
secundo Stat. Westminster. cap. XXXI. Item post diem datum de die in diem quod habet
fieri in eodem termino non iacet continue post defaltam in action Reali. non
competit in personali. non iacet continue post magnam districtionem, nec post
magnum cape, nec postquam praeceptum est vicecomiti quod faciat aliquem venire
vel quod habeat corpus alicuius, vel quod capiat aliquem, vel postquam mandatum
fuerit Episcopo, quod faceret venire clericum suum. In casu etiam quando vir
and vxor vel duo tenentes in communi implacitantur, non habebunt de caetero
nisi vnicum essonium, quia si vnus se essoniauerit and alter compauerit ad
alium diem illi qui comparuit non potest se essoniare quia sunt in statu quasi
vnius personae. quaeratur autoritas in primo Stat. Westminster. cap. XLIII. and in
Stat. Glocest. cap. X. Et istud solum essonium and non aliud tam i^cet
attornato quam principali personae. Ita tamen quod si quis essoniauerit seipsum
and non attornatum suum, non allocabitur ei essonium suum. Et si duos habuerit
atturnatos vel plures, and vnum and non alium essoniauerit vel si plures
habuerit and miserit vnum essonium, non allocabitur ei essonium. Sed videtur
instantiam recipere, in casu quo lex vadiata fuerit per atturnatum, postquam
atturnatus se non poterit essoniare, quia post legem vadiatam dictum est per
Iustitiarios atturnato quod faciat venire dominum suum in propria persona sua
ad faciendum legem. Quartum essonium est de malo lecti, cuius adiornamentum est
in morbo transeunti sicut adiornamentum de malo veniendi, secundum discretionem
Iustitiariorum, and in languore vnius anni and vnius diei a die visus sui apud
Turrim London. Et habet istud essonium quasdam proprietates quas non habent
alia essonia, videlicet, quod alia essonia in ipso primo die placiti proferri
debent, istud in tertio die praecedenti. Item in alijs essonijs sufficit vnus
es^oniator, in isto exiguntur duo essoniatores. Item alia essonia iacent sine
essonio praecedenti immediate, istud essonium non iacet nisi immediate
praecedat essonium de malo veniendi. Praeterea in alijs essonijs datur certus
dies, sed in isto essonio dicitur essoniatoribus quoth eant sine die and iacet
solummodo in omni breue de recto, ante apparentiam and post, exceptis quibusdam
casibus, scilicet in breui in quo non iacet duellum, vel magna assisa, vt inter
eos qui per eundem sanguinem and eundem discensum clamant. Item in alijs
breuibus de recto, quum placitum fuerit in eodem comitatu non iacet nisi causa
sit vera; quia si convincatur falsa, vertetur in defaltam. Quaeratur autoritas
in secundo Stat. Westminster. cap. XIX. Quintum essonium est de seruicio domini Regis
and iacet in quolibet placito and loco, exceptis quatuor casibus, videlicet
Nouae disseisinae, de Dote vnde nihil habet, vltimae praesentationis, and in
Appello de morte hominis. In quibus non iacet, eo quod Rex non concedit
protectionem suam in casibus illis and alijs casibus in quibus nullum iacet
essonium. Et solummodo allocabitur istud essonium si ad diem datum proferatur
warrantum Regis, et licet istud essonium videatur allocatum esse eo quod
adiornatur non tamen adiornatur sine condition sicut alia essonia, quia si ad
diem datum non proferatur warrantum, sequitur paena talis. qui non habet
warrantum in action reali, vertetur in defaltam. in action personali
condemnabitur ad expensas. quaeratur auctoritas in Stat. Glocest. cap. VIII.

CAP. II. Breuia de Dote.
SCiendum quod tria sunt breuia de dote vnde nihil habet, videlicet vnum breue
de communi dote quod est tale. Praecipe A. quod just etc. reddat B. quae fuit
vxor C. rationabilem dotem suam quae eam contingit de libero tenemento quod
fuit praedicti C. quondam viri sui in tali villa vnde nihil habet etc. Et per
istud breue petitur tertia pars tenementi quod fuit viri sui die quo eam
desponsauit and postea. Et aliquando medietas vt de socagio, and tamen non de
omnibus sed de antiquis and de hijs de quibus mulieres dotari consueuerint
secundum consuetudinem certae patriae. Et istud breue aliquando est clausum vt
in casu quando nihil habet and aliquando patens, quando aliquid habet and
aliquid deficit. In quibus casibus vnum and aliud locum habent. Invenietur in
Prouisione de Merton cap. I. In supradicto breui clauso adiudicari debent damna
mulieri de tenementis de quibus vir obijt seisitus. De tenementis vero
alienatis per virum de quacunque dote petita per breue patens non adiudicantur
damna. Aliud est breue de dote nominata, quando vir dotat vxorem suam and hoc
aliquando de minori quam de tertia part, and de hoc tenebit se contentam. Et
aliquando de tertia part in certo loco and si non excedit tertiam partem
remanebit illa certa dos. aliquando autem de maiori and remanebit ei quousque
admensuretur and reddatur ei per breue de admensuratione dotis; and in hoc
breui sicut in alijs adiudicantur damna. Et est breue de dote nominata tale.
Praecipe D. quod just etc. reddat B. quae fuit vxor C. tale manerium de quo
praedictus C. eam dotauit nominatim ad ostium ecclesiae quando eam desponsauit
etc. Aliud est breue quando filius dotat vxorem suam de tenementis patris sui
and de voluntate patris sui quod aliquando est de certo tenemento nominato;
aliquando de tertia part omnium tenementorum patris sui, quo similiter damna
adiudicantur, and est breue tale. Praecipe A. quod just etc. reddat B. quae
fuit vxor C. tale manerium vel tertiam partem tenementoru^ de quo vel de qua
praedictus C. eam dotauit de assensu and voluntate E. patris ipsius C. ad
ostium ecclesiae etc.

CAP. III. Exceptiones contra Breuia de Dote.
EXceptiones contra praedicta breuia, and maxim contra primum potest obijci
quod demandans dotem suam habere non debet, eo quod praedictus C. quondam vir
suus die quoeam desponsauit vel vnquam postea non tenuit tenementum vnde petit
dotem in dominico vt de feodo. Et per hoc non excluditur, quin habebit dotem de
tenemento quod per virum suum vel antecessorem dimissum fuit ad terminum ante
desponsationem and remansit in manu terminarij vsque ad obitum viri. quia licet
commodum rei fuit terminario, tamen feodum and dominicum remansit paenes virum.
Item in omnibus breuibus praedictis potest obijci quum vir suus commisit
feloniam, ob quam fuit suspensus, vtlagatus vel alio modo morti damnatus, vel
demembratus, vel apud Douere infalistatus, vel apud Suthampton submersus, vel
apud Winton demembratus, vel decapitatus vt apud Northampton, in mari
supervndatus sicut in alijs partibus portuum. nec recolo in alijs casibus in
quibus homo habetur pro felone, nisi in casu vbi quis mouet guerram contra
Regem, vel Regnum, ita quod abiurauit regnum, vel in fugiendo tanquam publicus
latro fuit decollatus. Item quod inter ipsam and virum suum diuortium fuit
celebratum. Item si vir suus amiserit tenem^^^m vnde illa dotem petit per
iudicium excepto iudicio per defaltam, de quo dicitur in secundo Stat.
Westmonast. cap. IV. Item amittit vxor dotem in casu de quo dicitur in ijsdem
statutis cap. XXXVIII. Item si minor existens in custodia alicuius duca^ vxorem
sine assensu domini sui, and in minori aetate obierit, dotem amittit. Secus est
si expectet aetatem. Item vxor quae propter minorem aetatem suam, vel propter
minorem aetatem viri sui non potest dotem deseruire ab action dotis excluditur
excepto tamen si a minori dotetur ex voluntate patris, quia licet sit inhabilis
secundum ius commune, volunt^s tamen patris, quae firmatur secundm
conventionem, facit habilitatem. Alia vero exceptio est, si obijciatur quod non
suit viro legitime dsponsata etc. Sed istius exceptionis discussio pertinet ad
episcopum and ordinarium, and secundum eius responsionem procedatur ad
iudicium. Sed quid erit si pro vna muliere petente dotem, cui obiecta fuerit
praedicta exceptio, scribatur episcopo, and per responsum episcopi mulier illa
recuperabit dotem, and post modum venerit alia mulier petens dotem de dono
eiusdem mariti and similiter obijciatur quod non fuit viro legitimo matrimonio
copulata, and ordinarius scribat Regi quod vltima est vxor legitima, and quod
deceptus fuit in priore casu matrimonij? Dato hoc stabitur posteriori mandato
Ordinarij. Sic contingit de Albraeda and Alicia de Pasham. Alia est exceptio,
quod si petat dotem de muliere dotata dicitur quod de dote non debet dotem
habere, sed intelligendum est quod illa exceptio non repellit quamlibet
mulierem ab action vel a petitione dotis. Quia contingit in casu. Radulphus
habens vnam carucatam terrae ducit vxorem and dotat eam and postmodum dat filio
suo vnam virgatam terrae qui ducit vxorem and dotat eam, mortuo filio Radulphi,
vxor filij dotata est de tertia part virgatae terrae, mortuo Radulpho vxor
Radulphi petit dotem de toto. Si obijciatur ei quod de dote non debet habere
dotem, non allocabitur ei exceptio illa, quia in priori contractu matrimonij
inter Radulphum and vxorem suam adquisitum fuit ius vxori praedicti Radulphi de
toto. nec debet ei praeiudicare secundus contractus inter filium Radulphi and
vxorem suam post do^atam. Saecus est si Radulphus obierit ante filium suum and
dotem suam recuperauerit de tenemento quod Radulphus dedit filio suo and
similiter de tenementis quae remanserunt praedicto R. post illud donum, si
postmodum prius mortuo R. praedicto, and postmodu^ filio Radulphi, veniat vxor
filij and petat dotem vers^s vxorem Radulphi quae ius habuit in toto, obstabit
ei illa exceptio, quod de dote dotem non habebit, etc.

CAP. IV. De visu concedendo.
VT sciatur in quibus casibus visus terrae concedatur sciendum est quod in
omnibus breuibus quae incipiunt Praecipe tali quod reddat aliquid quod actor
petit tenere ad minus ad vitam, vel ad terminum vitae alterius, vt in breuibus
de recto, and ingressu, and consanguinitate, de forma donationis, de Eschaeta,
and similibus in quibus tenetur in dominico, visus conceditur; exceptis
quibusdam casibus. Quia per hoc quod dicitur ad terminum vitae excluditur breue
de custodia. Per hoc quoth dicitur breue de Recto de tenementis, excluditur breue
de consuetudinibus and seruicijs, and breue de Recto de aduocatione ecclesiae,
in quo visus non conceditur si tantum sit vna ecclesia in villa in breui
contenta. Et si plures sint ecclesiae and nominetur ecclesia talis sancti, si
plures ecclesiae de illo sancto in eadem villa non habeantur. Per hoc quod
dicitur tenens in dominico, excluditur warrantus sine quo tenens se non posse
dicit respondere. exceptis quibusdam casibus etc. Cuiusmodi sunt commune breue
de dote vnde nihil habet de tenementis vnde vir suus objit seisitus. Item breue
de dote assignata, quando filius dotat vxorem ex voluntate patris and alij sunt
casus expressi ex statutis Westmonast. secundi cap. LIII. Per hoc quod dicitur
Praecipe quod reddat tenementum excluditur breue de nuper obijt in quo visus
non conceditur licet tenementum per illud petatur. Alia sunt pluria breuia in
quibus visus conceditur, nec tamen fit Mencio quod aliquis reddat tali, sed
quod permittat etc. Sicut in omnibus breuibus de ingressu, quae proveniunt and
originem habent a breuibus nouae disseisinae de communia pasturae, and omnibus
alijs de quibus fit mentio in vltimo statuto Westmonast. cap. XXIX. Item in
omnibus alijs breuibus de ingressu de fossato de stagno etc. de quibus iacet
assisa exceptis quibusdam casibus pasturae. Quia si petatur communia vbique in
villa de qua fit mentio, non est necesse concedere visum, sed si in aliquo loco
petatur and in aliquo loco non, necessario habet concedi. Vnum est breue de
recto quod non est de forma supradictorum breuium, scilicet Quo iure in quo
Nonnullis mss. non conceditur.
conceditur visus, si actor dicat Reum nullo modo communicare in terris suis,
sicut dictum est de Pastura. Sunt alia breuia quae ad Vicecomitem pertinent
placitanda quae aliquando ponantur coram Iustitiarijs vt de Domo, muro, porta,
gurgite, in quibus propter nocumentum, visus conceditur; and de quibusdam
consimilibus, vt de mercato, feria, Ouili non conceditur visus quia non est
necessarius.

CAP. V. De breuibus Assisarum. and primo de breui nouae Disseisinae.
SCiendum est de quibus iacet Assisa, and quibus fit modis disseisina, and
quibus personis competit, and contra quos. De quibus; sciendum est quod de
tenementis cuiusmodi sunt terra, pratum, Boscus, Pastura, Vastum, Piscaria
separalis, ad minus versus deforciantes, Gurgites and alia quae numerantur in
secundo statuto Westmonast. cap. XXIX. Quae in seisina alicuius sunt aliquo
titulo in feodo, vel ad minus ad terminum vitae and hoc aliquando ad vitam
possessoris, de quo non fit distinctio. Aliquando ad vitam dimittentis, super
quo distinguitur. vel dimittens nihil aliud habuit quam ad terminu^ vitae vt
Rector ecclesiae, tenens in dote^, and consimilibus in quibus casibus
transfertur liberum tenementu^ in possessore^, vel dimittens habens feodu^
transfert in possessorem ad vitam dimittentis reseruata reuersione haeredibus
vel alijs in quo casu aliquoru^ opinio est quoth liberu^ tenementu^ non
transfertur. Iacet et de Fossato prostrata, vel leuato, stagno prostrato vel
exaltato, sepe prostrata, leuata, vel exaltata, via obstructa, vel arctata,
aqua diuersa, pro cursu aquae ad nocumentum arctato. Quaedam sunt consimilia ad
nocumentum leuata, de quibus non datur Assisa, sed pertinent ad vicecomitem
placitanda, veluti Domus, Virgultum, Porta, ouile, molendinum, Gurges, and
Furnus. Quaedam and hijs similia quae sunt ad nocumentum, quae coram
Iustitiarijs sunt placitanda, vt feria, mercatum.

CAP. VI. De titulis. Hereditaria successione, feoffamento, and Eschaeta.
quomodo acquiritur liberum tenementum.
ET quod dicitur supra de titulo, sciendum est quod very tituli sunt Successio
haereditaria, feoffamentum [perquisitum titulo feoffamenti] Eschaeta. Sed in
quibusdam horum casuum, mayor exigitur seisina, ad liberum tenementum
perquirendum, and in quibusdam minor. Vt in successione vero haeredi per pedis
positionem adquiritur liberum tenementum, quia posito pede adquiritur liberum
tementum de toto tenemento quod annectitur tenemento in quo pes ponitur, vel
cui illud tenementum annectitur. Non sic est de haerede non vero, veluti de
vero Bastardo vel nato ante matrimonium, vel alio de longiore sanguine. Licet
ante aduentum very haeredis stet in haereditate per magnum tempus, videlicet
per dimidium anni vel amplius, and postea verus haeres eum eijciat, non propter
hoc timere oportet verum haeredem breue nouae disseisinae, quia possessio non
very haeredis scisina vel ad quisitio dici non debet sed potiu^ Intrusio. Si
autem contingat quod post mortem alicuius intrat verus haeres, and alius qui
verus non est, and similiter morantur in possessione per magnum tempus, and
postea verus haeres eijciat non verum, non competit non vero actio vel remedium
per disseisinam. Sed si non verus eijciat verum, vero haeredi competit actio,
quia cum ambo essent in seisina, seisina dicitur illius qui maius ius habet. De
titulo liberi tenementi per adquisitionem per feoffamentum, multa sunt
consideranda. Quia cum aliquis feoffat alium non tam cito transfertur liberum
tenementum in feoffatum sicut superius dictum est in successione haereditaria.
Quia primo videndum est vtrum feoffator feoffat aliu^, absque alterius
praeiudicio, in quo casu per bonam transmutationem adquiritur feoffato liberum
tenementum; de his maxim de quibus se dimisit ad plenum, nullo sibi reseruato
praeter seruicium. Et si forte in praeiudicium alterius fiat feoffamentum, non
tam cito adquiritur liberum tenementum feoffato, vt in casu quo feoffator se
facit medium inter Capitalem Dominum and feoffatum, vbi oportet quoth plena and
pacifica seisina fiat feoffato antequam competat actio ei versus feoffatorem,
contra quod tamen potest subueniri per finem factum, vel per Recognitionem
factam coram Rege vel Iustitiarijs, quarum virtute adquiret feoffatus liberum
tenementum non obstante contradictione capitalis domini. Et similiter si vxor
dotata, vir tenens per legem Angliae, vel aliter ad terminum vitae, vel per
feodum talliatum. in supradictis tenuris feoffato requiritur longa seisina and
pacifica antequam adquiratur ei liberum tenementum. Et in huiusmodi
feoffamentis multa alia consideranda, videlicet remo^a absentia illius cuius
interest; tempus quo ad ipsum deuenire possit notitia, potestas eius resistendi
and multa alia. Similiter de Villano alienante villenagiu^, and Balliuo
alienante tenementum in custodia sua existens, in quibus casibus, de breui
seisina, non adquiritur liberum tenementum. In titulo per Eschaetam. adquisitio
quae aliquando adquiritur Capitali Domino per feloniam tenentis and in alijs
casibus his similibus, vt in reuersione post seodum talliatum de iure, and quod
alicui competit per formam donationis, de facili adquiritur liberum tenementum
ratione reuersionis ad personam a qua vel cuius antecessoribus exiuit
tenementum, cessante successione reuertendi, ^l per formam donationis alicuius
remansurum. Sed in istis duobus casibus, diuersa exigitur verificatio in
iudicio, quia in reuersione ratione feodi talliati vel doni sub condition non
exigitur quod clamans reuersionem scriptum aut aliquid aliud ostendat ad
intentionem suam probandam, quam patriam; eo quod carta doni paenes
adquisitorem ex consuetudine remanet and non paenes donatorem. Et ideo
tenementum sine ostensione cartae ad donatorem reuerti potest. In alio casu
quando debet remanere extraneae personae non al. continuo.
coniunctae post mortem alicuius, necesse habet petens ostendere finem vel
cartam de forma doni. Et cum dicitur supra quod titulus liberi tenementi
tripliciter adquiritur, non propter hoc credat aliquis quin alia via adquiritur
alicui liberum tenementum, attamen per aliquem colorem oportet quod supponatur
praedictis titulis, verbi gratia. Quidam ingreditur per disseisinam quae nullum
facit titulum; postea disseisitus remittit and quietum clamat totum ius suum.
Iam habet dis^eisitor titulum liberi tenementi per quietam clamantiam
disseisiti vbi prius non habuit, (...) sic aequipollet quieta clamantia
feoffamento. Praescriptio similiter and praesumptio fit aliquando loco tituli.
verbi gratia. Aliquis ingreditur per disseisinam and disseisitus aetatis and
suae potestatis permittit dis^eisitorem per magnum tempus tenere ipsum non
eijciendo nec versus ipsum impetrando actionem; quare praesumitur, ex quo per
tantum tempus stetit in seisina per aliquem titulum clamauit tenere. Et propter
hoc si post magnum tempus eijciatur, competit remedium per breue nouae
disseisinae. Mulieri etiam dotatae, sieve tenenti per legem Angliae, competit
remedium per breue nouae disseisinae, si eijciantur quia donum viri in dote est
quoddam genus perquisitionis. Similiter adquiritur tenementum ad terminum vitae
viri ducendo mulierem, cuius haereditas tenementum est; and sub eodem genere
comprehendi potest. Quorundam tamen ingressus cum ceperit per praedictos
titulos vel sub color eorundem titulorum nunquam alicui facit liberum
tenementum. Et illis, quibus dimittitur aliquod tenementum ad voluntatem, vel
ad terminum annorum, licet a tam magno tempore tenuerint, cuius dimissio non
poterit haberi in memoria, nunquam adquiritur liberum tenementum, nisi per
consequens factum videlicet per feoffamentu^ aut quietam clamantiam illius cui
fuit liberu^ tenementu^* Et hoc intellige quoth liberum tenementu^ non adquiritur
illi cui supradicto modo facta fuit dimissio, sine facto illius cuius fuit
liberum tenementu^. sed aliquando contingit quoth huiusmodi tenentes ad voluntate^
vel ad terminum feoffant alios de facto, tn. de iure non possunt, and tn. per
eoru^ feoffamentum, adquiritur feoffatis liberu^ tenementum, quod nunquam
euenit per factum illorum qui nullam habent tenentiam. Et quod dicitur supra de
felonia, sciendum quod felones sunt suspensi, vtlagati, and alij de quibus
dicitur hic and supra in cap. de Dote Tertio; vti ha^ distinguitur editione.
secundo.

CAP. VII. Quibus modis fit disseisina:
SCiendum, quod, cum quis tenens realiter eijcitur de tenemento. item absens,
cum ingredi voluerit, eijcitur and repellitur. Item cum al. manuopere.
manuopus alicuius impeditur per No^nullis vel ^er ^uperfluam; alijs,
superstitiosam.
superfluosam, and hoc in tenemento diu ante appruato, vel de tenemento de nouo
appruando. verbi gratia. Si qui vastum suum non prius appruatum redigat in
culturam, salua tenentibus and vicinis sufficient pastura cum libero ingressu
and egressu, cum inceperit appruare impediatur, impeditor pro disseisitore
habetur. Item in pascendo alterius separale fit disseisina vt in vltimo statuto
Westmonast. cap. XXIX. Item aliquando continuando possessionem a qua
abiudicatur. verbi gratia. Diuortium celebratum est inter virum and mulierem,
si post diuortium vir teneat se in haereditate perquisita in maritagio
mulieris, statim cum post diuortium manuoperetur disseisitor est. Item intrando
per iudicium quod non ligat. verbi gratia. A. implacitat B. de tenementis C.
and fit iudicium de tenementis C. cum tria exigantur ad iudicium scilicet
Actor, reus, and Iudex, and in isto iudicio deficiat vnus trium, videlicet
verus tenens qui dicitur reus, ille qui recuperat pro disseisitore habetur.
Eodem modo si in Curia Comitis Glocestriae recuperatur tenementum alicuius quoth
est de feodo Comitis Warreniae; quia defuit ibi Iudex, ille qui recuperat pro
disseisitore habetur. Et tamen illa iudicia non peccant in forma, quia verus
est ibi processus sed substantialia deficiunt. Non sic est in falsis iudicijs
quae habent sua substantialia, scilicet actorem, reum and iudicem (and his non
existentibus fit iniquum iudicium) quia istud iudicium ligat quousque
infirmetur, and solummodo competit recuperare per breue de falso iudicio and
non per breue nouae disseisinae. Item dicitur in ca^^, disseisitor quando non
per factum sit sed per aduocationem in Curia. Et hoc est cum ille qui dimisit
terram ad terminum posuerit se in tenementum ante terminum finitum and
terminarius eum eijciat, si ille qui dimisit terram ad terminum impetrauerit
breue nouae disseisinae versus terminarium, clarum est quod si terminarius
dicat se nihil habere nisi ad terminum and convincatur per assisam quod
terminarius eiectus ante terminum finitum vim vi repellendo se reposuerit,
impetrator nihil per assisam recuperabit. Sed si falso coram Iustitiarijs
clamauerit feoffamentum, and contrarium convincatur per illam falsam
clamationem factam in exhaeredationem illius qui tenementa ei dimisit, habeatur
pro disseisitore. Eodem modo si terminarius eiectus impetret breue nouae
disseisinae versus eum qui ad terminum ei dimisit, convicto quod nihil aliud
habuit quam terminum, per suam falsam clamationem, amittat terminum suum. Et
est disseisina de redditu in omni casu, cum tenementu^ aliquod alicui obligatur
in aliquo redditu, sieve de eo sieve de alio teneatur and districtio * recusetur
vel replegietur.

CAP. VIII. Quibus Personis competit assisa. Exceptiones item dilatoriae and
peremptoriae. De vocando in auxilium. per eundem descensum.
SCiendum est, quoth quibuscunque liberis and in statu liberorum existentibus, quoth
dicatur pro hijs qui in all. natiuitate.
nayvitate procreati sunt, and cum a magno tempore fugerint and ad remota loca
extra astrum se transtulerint and tenementa perquisierint, si ab illis
eijciantur, competit eis remedium per breue nouae disseisinae, and contra veros
dominos quia quousque natiuos in seruitutem per iudicium redigerint, ad
tenementa seisienda manum apponere non possunt. Villanis quidem in Astro
commorantibus non competit huiusmodi remedium versus veros dominos non magis de
perquisito, quam de villenagio. Si tamen de villenagio vel de perquisitis
eijciantur per extraneos competit eis remedium per breue nouae disseisinae;
quia in hoc casu villanus non quo ad veru^ dominu^ sed quoad extraneos pro
libero habetur. Eodem etiam modo Sokemannus de antiquo domino, licet contra
dominum vel vicinum de eodem socagio placitare non possit nisi per paruum breue
de recto clausum, versus tamen extraneum si eum eijciat competit ei remedium
per breue nouae disseisinae. Competit etiam liberis a magno tempore in
seruitutem redactis, illis videlicet quorum patres and aui and quicunque
antecessores a tempore quo currit breue de recto in seruitute^ redacti fuerint.
quamd^u enim in astro morantur competit eis remedium ad liberum al. tenementum.
statum rehabendum per breue Ne Vexes. Et si a tenemento eijcian^ur non
competit eis aliud remedium quam per breue nouae disseisinae. Sciendum est,
quod contra quamlibet personam; dum tamen verus nominetur tenens, quo in breui
non nominato, nihil impetranti acquiritur. Competit etiam aliquando viro contra
vxorem in casu in quo vxor profuga alienat tenementum viri sui, vel etiam
tenementum vxoris. Contra impetrantem competunt exceptiones aliquando
dilatoriae aliquando peremptoriae breuis. Dilatoriae; veluti sententia
exco^municationis. excipitur etiam contra impetrantem quod nihil habet nisi
ratione vxoris, vel contra clericum qui nihil habet nisi ratione ecclesiae
suae, de qua non fit mentio in breui, vel quod Villanus vel Sokmannus est, de
quorum discussione dicitur supra. Item excipitur contra virum and vxorem, si
disseisina facta fuerit mulieri ante matrimonium and conquerantur ambo
disseisiri. Cassatur etiam breue si erratum sit in nominibus personarum,
villae, aut Comitatus. Similiter si dominus questus fuerit se disseisiri de
redditu and conuincatur quod seisitus fuerit de redditu per manus villanorum,
super quo iacet breue nouae disseisinae de teneme^to in dominico potius quam de
redditu. Peremptoriae breuis. eo quod alias assisa transiuit; ad quod
requiritur quod de eodem tenemento inter easdem personas de eodem tempore. Item
si quis clamat liberum tenementum sieve exprimat titulum sieve non, and
recognoscatur per assisam quod iure successionis intrauit, and pendet inter eos
placitum in Curia Christianitatis de Bastardia; quamdiu fuerit placitum in
Curia Christianitatis remanebit placitum in Curia Regis in suspenso. Competit
etiam exceptio quietae clamantiae, feloniae praeiudicatae, exchambij and
consimiles etc. In breuibus assisarum and in ombus alijs breuibus generaliter
locum habet ista exceptio, videlicet si tenens dicat quod nihil clamat nisi cum
vxore sua coniunctim. Et hoc tripliciter, vel quoth fuerint similiter feoffati,
and tunc habet necesse ostendere cartam, vel quoth invenit vxorem suam seisitam,
antequam eam desponsa^it, vel quod tenementum petitum vxori suae descendit iure
haereditario post desponsationem. Item alia est exceptio ad cassandum breue
videlice^ si tenens dicat se nihil clamare nisi ad voluntatem talis vel se esse
villanum alicuius, vel tenere de villenagio tali; quo comperto vel recognito
cassatur breue. in quo casu vel oportet petentem intrudere se in tenementum si
potest vel impetrare aliud breue super dominum ipsius tenentis and super
tenentem. Item potest excipi quod tenens nihil clamat nisi ratione custodiae
talis minoris infra aetatem, qui in breui non nominatur. Replicatio contra
istam exceptionem potest esse quod antecessor illius minoris non obijtinde
seisitus, nec die quo obijt habuit aliud in tenemento petito. Si tenens dicat
quod antecessor illius minoris ius habuit in tenemento illo, and iterum alia
proponatur replicatio quae vera est quod antecessor illius minoris aliquod
habuit, sed id quod habuit dimisit ad plenum eidem petenti per feoffamentum,
tunc vlterius distinguendum est, ex quo tenens cognouit antecessorem minoris
aliquod habuisse etc. si antecessor illius minoris obijt etc. vel non, quod
fieri non potest, sine breui in quo minor nominetur. quia dato quod assisa
transierit contra minorem, minor cum ad aetatem pervenerit non posset facere
attinctam, quia fuit neutra pars in breui priori, and sic cassatur breue. Alia
est exceptio dilatoria quando reus dicit se non posse respondere sine suo
participe; quod est in casu quando haereditas descendit duabus sororibus, aut
pluribus vel exitui vnius vel ambarum, and postquam haereditas partita fuerit,
si vnus haeredum de part sua implacitatus fuerit, excipere possit quoth tenet in
proparte cum tali cohaerede sine quo non potest respondere and in hoc casu
p^cipiatur quoth haeredes summoneantur ad respondendum cum ea si voluerint. Et si
ad die^ venerint and respondere voluerint cum participe audiantur and tunc
procedat placitu^ versus eos, tanqua^ versus vnu^ tenente^. Et si forte ad diem
datu^ non venerint nec essoniatore^ miserint, vel forte ad diem datum per
essonium non venerint, respondeat tenens solus. Sed sane intelligatur quod illa
exceptio locum habet quando res petitur per ius quod competere posset actori
ante mortem communis antecessoris. Quia si quis petat per aliquod ius quod ei
competere posset per factum cohaeredis post participationem haereditatis, satis
clarum est quoth in hoc casu non habebit auxilium participis. quia potest esse
quod cohaeredes rem vnam litigiosam vendiderint, vel excambiauerint vel per
iudicium per malam defensionem amiserint, vel per felonia^ forisfecerint
antequam cohaeres de re litigiosa fuerit implacitatus. In quo casu dicendum est
quoth de nihilo non est auxilium petendum. Dictum est qualiter petitur auxilium
participis quando cohaeredes implacitantur de tenementis. Sed contingit
aliquando quod sectae Curiae, Iurisdictiones, libertates, seruicia, and
consuetudines veniunt in iudicium inter querentem and vnu^ de participibus
tenentem manerium vel tenementum ad quod spectant huiusmodi sectae,
iurisdictiones, libertates seruicia and consuetudines in quo casu, tenendum est
quod sicut tenens habere debuit auxilium participis de principali ita habebit
de accessorio. Dum tamen illud accessorium ad annuum proficuum extendi
posset-hoc obseruato tamen de huiusmodi supradictis quae fuerunt in possessione
co^munis anteces^oris antequam haereditas fuerit partita and quae ad vnicum
haerede^ per extentam proficui devenerunt. Et sic excluditur obiectio. In casu,
si vnus haeredum leuauerit iniustas exactiones and consuetudines de propria sua
iniuria in quo casu non erit auxilium participis petendum. Alius est casus, quo
tenens dicit quod non potest sine alio respondere videlicet cum Rector
implacitatus fuerit de iure ecclesiae suae dicit quod inuenit ecclesiam suam
seisitam and quod non potest sine patrono and loci Diocesano respondere, in quo
casu praecipiatur patrono and loci diocesano summoneri. Et si venerint vel non
venerint vel diem datum per essonium suum non servauerint, seruetur processus
supradictus. Alius est casus consimilis quando tenens per legem Angliae dicit
quod tenementum petitum fuit ius vxoris suae de qua procreauit quendam talem
sine quo non debet respondere. Summonebitur tunc ille and post summonitionem
seruetur processus supradictus. Sed differunt isti duo casus vltimi a
superioribus, quia si tenens in istis duobus casibus vltimis amittat rem
petitam nullum erit suum recuperare super episcopum, patronum, aut haeredes,
sed in superiorib^ casibus de participibus tenens obseruato suo ordine, si
amiserit, recuperabit super cohaeredem per processum vlterius procedendi. Sed
vnam proprietatem habent omne^ isti casus supradicti quod sieve cohaeres sieve
patronus sieve haeres haereditatis quae tenetur per legem Angliae fuerint infra
aetatem, generaliter remanebit loquela vsque ad aetatem haeredis, and per hoc
quod dicitur supra quod rector invenit ecclesiam suam seisitam ^atis excluditur
dubitatio si rector de suo perquisito vel de sua intrusione aliquid appropriat
ecclesiae suae, in quo casu non potest auxilium patroni aut Diocesani sui
petere. Sed est casus quando mulier dotata implacitatur de dote sua in quo casu
distinguendum est vtrum petatur versus eam tenementum vel tenemento annexum, vt
iurisdictio vel secta and huiusmodi in valorem partis dotis suae extensa. In
primo casu vocare potest ad warrantiam tanquam warrantum dotis suae. In secundo
casu cum non iaceat vocare ad warrantiam, habet dicere quod non potest sine
haerede respondere, and tunc summonebitur haeres ad respondendum ficut
praedictum est si voluerit, in quo casu seruabitur processus supradictus. Et in
vtro que casu si vxor pro defectu warranti haeredis amiserit, recuperabitmulier
excambium non tamen ad plenum valorem rei amissae. Cuius ratio been patet
subtiliter intuenti. In assisa mortis antecessoris and in alijs breuibus post
visum terrae iacet exceptio de non tenura; quae sic debet proponi. dicit B.
quod non debet A. ad breue suum responderi eo quod non tenet integram terram
versus eum petitam, eo quod talis inde tantum tenet, and talis tantum inde
tenet, quo comperto per inquisitionem vel recognitionem cassabitur breue
Replicatio contra istam exceptionem. B tenuit die quo breue fuit impetratum and
hoc in feodo vel in dominico vel si illa ten^^t de B. ad terminu^ annorum vel
in villenagio vel ad voluntatem, quo comperto, vel recognito, stabit breue. Et
sciendum quod in breuibus Assisarum potest proponi ista exceptio cum alijs
exceptionibus tangentibus verba breuis. Sed in alijs breuibus si proponatur cum
effectu, cum ea non possunt proponi aliae exceptiones, sed secundum quod per
eam compertum fuerit, fiat iudicium and hoc diuersimode. quia in breuibus
Eschaetae, de ingressu, forma donationis, and consanguinitatis, and alijs in
quibus non iacet duellum vel magna assisa, si inquisitio facit pro excipiente,
tunc cassabitur breue and sic est dilatoria. Si pro part adversa recuperabit
petens tenem^tum, salua tamen tenenti action per breue de Recto. Et si in
breui de Recto proponatur ista exceptio cum effectu adimit ei ius contra quem
transiuit. Proponitur aliquando exceptio huic similis, cum non sit, ^ic
dicendo, quod tenens versus quem petuntur viginti, non tenet viginti eo quod
tenet nisi december. in quo casu si non possit dicere quis teneat residuum,
oportet respondere de eo quod tenet. Tam in breuibus assisarum quam in alijs
breuibus iacent exceptiones dilatoriae sic dicendo. Tu petis versus A. tantum
and versus B tantum, ac si vterque sciret suum separale and ipsi tenent in
communi, quo comperto eodem modo eri^ vt supra. Et est alia exceptio in assisa
mortis Antecessoris sic. tu petis de morte A. and verum est A. obijt seisitus
sed post eius mortem intrauit B. filius vel soror vel neptis vel consanguinea
and de sicut non petis seisinam vltimi seisiti peto iudicium, quo comperto
cassabitur breue sed fallit hoc casu. in casu scilicet in quo non intrat verus
haeres, licet habeatur pro consanguineo, de cuius seisina non cassabitur breue,
pro eo maxim quod si ipse inventus es^et tenens and seisitus potius haberetur
pro iniusto deforciatore quam pro vero tenente. Item quidam pro ratione
feoffamenti quod defunctus ei fecit, post mortem defuncti ingreditur tenem^tum
and sub color feoffamenti est seisitus, licet feoffamentum sic vacuum, venit
post verus haeres and eijcit sic seisitum, per quod tenementum recuperabitur
per breue nouae disseisinae, and postmodum verus haeres per assisam mortis
antecessoris sui pe^at, and excipiatur contra eum quod seisitus fuit post
mortem antecessoris sui, replicare poterit quod illa seisina adnullari poterit
vel adnullata fuerit per assisam ^ouae disseisinae per exceptionem, quo
comperto non valebit sua exceptio. Item duo cohaeredes sunt, vnus antecessor,
and vnus ingreditur in tota haereditate and eijcitur postmodum, si nomine
amborum perquiratur breue mortis antecessoris, and excipiatur quod vnus ipsorum
fuit seisitus post mortem antecessoris, non propter hoc cassabitur hoc breue,
pro eo quod and sunt quasi vnus haeres and per factum vnius, non adnullabitur
actio amborum cum ambo non fuerint seisiti. Alia est exceptio in breui mortis
antecessoris dicendo, tu petis tenementum de morte talis patris sui and been
cognosco quod obijt seisitus and post mortem eius ego intraui, vt filius suus,
nepos, and sumus de eodem sanguine and clamamus per eundem descensum vnde peto
iudicium. proposita exceptione praedicta, praedictis verbis, nisi in contrarium
obijciatur bastard^a vel diuersitas consanguinis cassatur breue, and reuertetur
ad breue de Recto, in quo non iacet duellum nec magna assisa. Sed quid erit si
tenens vocet ad warrantiam, and warrantus postquam warrantizauerit vel vlterius
alium vocauerit ad warrantum? postquam warrantizauerit, cassabitur breue per
eundem descensum. Et similiter si tenens per legem Angliae dicat quod nihil
clamat nisi ratione haereditatis vxoris suae. Et haeres postquam summonitus
fuerit cassat breue per eundem descensum. Et si postmodum petens perquirat
breue de Recto, nunquid poterit tenens defendere se per duellum vel per magnam
assisam, cum non sit de sanguine petentis? certe non* quia ex quo alias
warrantus suus cassauit breue per exceptionem eiusdem descensus, in breui de
recto, non magis defendit se per duellum vel per magnam assisam, quam
defenderit ille qui prius cassat si compertus fuisset tenens.

Notes upon Sir Ralph de Hengham.
Page 1. Primicerijs.] he means Protonotaries. The word is often in
Constitutions of the time of the declining Empire; as Primicerius sacri
cubiculi, Lampadariorum, Officioru^ Palatinorum, and the like. Among them was
Primicerius Notariorum, that is, the Emperors chief Notarie. Alciat. ad Cod.
12. tit. 7. Primicerius, Notarius principis dicitur, and honor inter Notarios
primus, sicut sequens dicitur secundicerius. (...) n. ceram significat, (...)
tabulam signatam, in qu^ antiqui scribebant. ab huiuscemodi igitur tabulis
dicti sunt primicerij. Those primicerij Notariorum in Rome, although discharged
from their office, yet remaind in equal degree of honor with the Proconsuls,
as appears in a Constit. of Gratian, Theodosius, and Valentinian in Cod.
Theodos. lib. 6. tit. 10.

Page 2. Modus Cyrograffandi.] It seems by this, that either we have not all
his first copy, or else he never finished what he here promises. For we have no
more of it.

Page 5. I. filio Alani Comiti de Arundel.] By marriage of a Fitz-Alan with the
heir female of the D' Aubignies Earl of Arundel, came that surname, which is
here, as a word literally signifying, turned into Latin, by Filius Alani. It
was usual in those elder times to do so. As to express Champernoun, by de
Campo Arnulphi 7. Ed. 3. fol. 35. a and 49. b. and the rolls have commonly
Filius Petri, Filius Herberti, de Bello monte, de Bellofago, de S. Leodegario,
de Monte Canisio, de Monte forti, Mortuo Mari, for Fitz-Peeter, Fitz-Herbert,
Beaumont, Beaufage, S. Leiger, Mount-Chensy, Mount-fort, Mortimer, and such
more. So in 29. Ed. 3. fol. 30. b. Colle beside Somersham and Colle iuxta
Somersham (although Colle indeed appeard in the record to be in Somersham) are
held all one in expressing the name of that place. In 30. Ed. 3. fol. 2. b.
villa de Pontefracto is Pomfreit in a praecipe, and in 38. Ed. 3. fol. 28.
Newark is taken in the name of the prioresse of Newark, as a name signifying a
new work. But in 25. Ed. 3. fol. 38. a. Apud villam Sancti Petri is disallowed
for apud Petreston, though one interpret the other. and the case of P. 11. Ed.
3. tit. quid iuris clamat 2. in the ms. is, that John de Brayford brought the
writ against Isabell Peuerell, grounded upon the note of a Fine, whereby
Gilbertus filius Stephani had granted the reuersion of the manor of Wolward
which Isabell held for life, to John in fee; and Parning took exception to the
note and writ, because this Gilberts fathers name was Richard Fitz-Esteuen
which Richard gave the manor in tail to Isabell etc. all that is stood on, in
the argument, is that of the name; and in the ms. occurres also icy fust dit
que tout fust il vtlaghe per tiel nome que il ne sereit pas per tant atteint
etc. and auxi sil fust endite per tiel nome que home ne irreit pas de ly
arreiner etc. and so Stonar (as in the print) gives judgment against the
Conuse. This case is rememberd in 11. Assis. pl. 4. And by 11. Ed. 3. tit.
Estoppell 228. Filius Thomae in Latin cannot be a surname; But, that its a
good plea, to show that the party so designed had a father of another name, its
held 40. Ed. 3. fol. 22. a. 44. Ed. 3. fol. 12. b. and the law has been lately
so taken, as you see in Osbornes case Rep. 10. fol. 132. b For other authority,
how Filius may be understood either as part of a name, as for a legitimate
son, or as a note of only natural relation, see 38. Ed. 3. fol. 22. a. 39.

Ib. Eadem gratia Lincolniensi Episcopo.] nothing is more usual of that time,
the^ to find Bishops, Abbots, Priors, and the like to have Dei gratia in their
titles. But later ages has appropried it to Kings. Jews XI. of France would
not endure, that Francis then Duke of Bretagne should use it. See Bodin. de
Republica lib. 1. cap. 10. and others noted in the Titles of Honor page 116.

Page 6. In liberum Burgagium] As free socage in the country of lands, so free
Burgage in Boroughs, and cities, is the tenure of houses, regularly* and they
are the two base tenures in regard of Knights service. Burgagium, socagium, and
Feodum militare make usually Bracton's tripartit division. See him lib. 4.
tract. de Assis. mort. antecessoris cap. 14. and in cap. praecedent.. 3. of
Burgage: Reuera terminatum est quod potest legari, vt catallum tam haereditas
quam perquisitum per Barons Londoniae and Burgenses Oxoniae, and ideoverum est
quoth in Burgis non iacet Assisa mortis antecessoris. that must be understood only
of such Boroughs as had by custom their lands deuisable. see Burgages
deuisables in Stat. 11. Ed. 1. Acton Burnell, Bract. fol. 272. a. and Thorpe
21. Ed. 3. fol. 21. b. Tradesmen that held these burgages are the Burgenses
intended in Stat. Merton cap. 7. where an heir of a Gentleman (a tenant by
Knights service) is disparaged, if married to Burgensis or Villanus; i. either
tradesman, or husbandman.

Ib. vel Maritagium.] Although Hengham lived and wrote after Westminster 2. yet this,
as other examples of his writs of right are, is of elder time then the statut.
Bracton fol. 329. a. has this very writ in substance, as of his time, and
thither must liberum maritagium be referd. For clearly since the statut of
Westminster. 2. a writ of Right would not lie for lands held in Frankmariage.

Ib. Nec pro omni seruitio.] But Bracton's writ with that tenure has
expressly Pro omni seruitio.

Ib. Portandi breuia.] Now breuia is appropried to the signification of the
Kings writs. Understand it in this tenure (which is mentioned also in Bracton
fol. 328. b. and Regist. Orig. fol. 2. b.) for letters of message and the like.
For, because the Kings writ was a short letter of command, therefore had it the
name of Breue. So Bracton lib. 5. de Except. cap. 17.. 2. and, in the Civil
law, both Breue and Breuis are in like sense. you may see C. tit. de
conveniendis fisci debit. l. 5. de apochis public. l. 1. and tit. 42. lib. 1.
restored by Gothofred. Very often also for letters, Breues and Breuia occur
in Theodosius his Code, Cassiodore's Precedents, Symmachus his Epistles, other
of that time. The later Grecians called it (...) and (...). yet those are as
ancient as Julian and Eusebius, who use them* and those, which wrote them, they
called (...), or Breuiatores which I read in Justinians Auth. 105. cap. 2. si
autem. 4. and an old Glossarie of the law interprets (...) by (...). letters of
presentation given by an Earl in 45. Edw. 3. tit. Exchange 10. are titled
Brief de presentation.

Page 7. Quando XL. solidi cap. de scuto.] So in Bracton also is the service
expressed. But the Register fol. 2. a. has a note that makes this form obsolet.
Now it should be, per seruitium quartae partis vnius feodi militis etc. Escuage
is here apparently meant. Neither had the ancients any more particulars in
denoting it, neither by them was it restrained to war against the Scots or
Welsh only, as by later authority it seems to be, where only Scotland and Wales
are spoken of, as in Litleton, Fitzh. Not. Br. fol. 83. C. Regist. Orig. fol.
88. a. 19 Rich. 2. tit. Guard 165. Plowd. Comm. c. Rice Thomas fol. 129. b. and
elsewhere. In the Red book of the Exchequer, Alexander Archdeadon of Shrewsbury
under Hen. 3. relates an Escuage of two marks out of every Knights see in 7.
Hen. 2. for the enterprise against Toulouse, in 8. Hen. 2. one mark for the
same purpose; In 18. Hen. 2. XX. ^. pro exercitu Hiberniae, and others he has
for war in Normandy, Poiters, elsewhere under Rich. 1. and King John. And
that they were such as are now understood in our tenure by escuage, will more
openly appear in Rot. Claus. 16. Iohannis memb. 24. in dorso, where the
Scutagia Pictauiae are at large in a Catalogue; as, Willus* de Cantebrigia,
quia habuit milites suos cum domino Rege in Pictauia, habet scutagium. And
there is also Mandatum est Domino Petro Wintoniensi Episcopo (he was then,
chief Justice of England) quoth habere faciat Willieimo Comiti Arundell Scutagium
de XVI. feodis militum quae Robertus de Tateshale qui est in Custodia sua de
Domino Rege tenet in capite s. de scuto 111. marcas, which passage I
sufficiently understand not. If Tateshale were in ward to the Earl (as so it
must be taken) either by the Kings grant or otherwise, why should he pay
escuage? if his land held in capite were to him by descent, how came the Earl
to the wardship? except by grant. Admit he had it by purchase, why should the
Earl have the escuage? except by way of liberate from the Kings bounty. Very
many other escuages are there, as Henricus de Tayden habet Scutagium de feodo
VI. militum ad opus filij sui qui est in Pictauia. Robertus de Cardman de LX.
and XIV. feodis militum pro filio suo qui fuit in Pictauia. Thomas Pannell
habet auxilium L. librarum Turonensium de libere tenentibus suis and alijs de
insula de Geresey. But, for the default of tenants not coming to the army, a
place in the Leiger book of Abingdon in the hands of my Noble and much
deserving friend, that best furnished Antiquary Sir Robert Cotton, is worth
observation. Est iuxta Abbe^dune Burgum (are the words) vnius militis mansio
quae Lea vocatur. Hanc Willielmus Regis Camerarius de Lundonia tenebat. This
William held it of the Abbey, and by Knights service; In 2. Hen. 1. forces were
levied to encounter Robert Duke of Normandy, when Faritius Abbot of Abingdon
required of William his tenant to find him a man for the army, as his tenure
bound him to do, but William denied it, whereby the Abbot was driven by other
means to supply the number of his part. The Abbot afterward tamdiu (as the book
says) in praesentia sapientum, hanc rem ventilari fecit, vt ille neutrum
negaret, imo fateri sic esse vera ratione cogeretur. Vnde cum lege patriae
decretum processisset ipsum exortem terrae merito deberi fieri, interpellatione
bonorum qui intererant virorum reddidit terram illam illi. and so the tenant
under fair conditions had his land again. This Lea is now called Besiles-Lee,
and is of the possessions of the Fettiplaces.

Ib. Vnde december carucatae etc.] This form also is disallowed by the Register.
But when it was in use, no particular quantity of the service was expressed,
because the land by reference to a Knights ^ee showed its own services. Bracton
lib. 5. tract. 1. cap. 2. vbi quantitas feodi exprimitur in quantitate terrae
petitae, non ponitur aliquod seruitium, quia in quantitate feodi ostenditur
quantitas seruitij. it being all one in substance to say that one holds IIII.
carues, whereof VIII. make a knights see, and that he holds so many acres or
carues per seruitium dimidij feodi militis. Carues and Hides are uncertain
quantities, yet by that name, division was anciently made in leuying Hidage and
Carucage. See what is noted in Titles of Honor page 270. and seq. and in Codice
Abingdoniae page 42. Goffredus de Ver Albrici filius gives to the Abbey some
possessions Cum duarum hidarum duodecies XX. acrarum terra disterminata. and
Hen. 1. gives to Maurice B. of London, duas hidas de duodccem XX. acris, so
that there 240. acres is taken for a hide. In the Monks ever with one consent
almost, it is always ^ Plough land. and S. Dunstan in the year DCCCC.LXIII.
gives terrae partem septem Aratrorum quod Anglice dicitur septem hydas. Its in
Cod. Chart. Arch. Cant. Thus should Hida and Carucata be all one. for, Carucata
speaks the Plough. Charou in French so signifying, as Litleton also notes. and
by ancient authority Caruca is a Plough, which is found in Iul. Paul. Recept.
Sentent. lib. 3. tit. 7. It seems when Hidage or Carucage was granted, the
commissioners for leuying it (with aid of Jurors) used in every shire to
assesse how much should be in certain reckond for a Hide or Carue. As in 9.
Rich. 1. when an aid of five shillings, of every Carue in the land, was to be
levied, qui electi fuerant and constituti ad hoc negotium regis faciendum,
statuerunt per aestimationem legalium hominum, ad vniuscuiusque Carucae
Wainagium centum acras terrae. Here 100. acres were for that purpose a Hide.
See Roger de Houeden fol. 442. and 443. Neither is any difference twixt
Carucata and Carucae wainagium. For wainagium is tulth as its Englisht in the
ancient English of Magna Charta, or Gainage as its called Westminster. ^. cap. 17.
See Bracton fol. 37. a. 4. Ed. 2. tit. Avowry 200 and especially Lowes case in
Rep. 9. fol. 123. b. and seqq.

Page 8. Seditione personae Domini Regis.] Bracton fol. 118. b. Si aliquid
egerit velagi procurauerit ad seditionem domini Regis vel exercitus sui etc. so
Glanvil. l. 1. cap. 2.

Ib. Vitae and membrorum.] Judgment de vie and de membre is v^d for Judgment of
death, or punishment capital, in Stat. Westminster. 2. cap. 38.3. Edw. 3. fol. 19. a
pl. 34. in 18. Ed. 3. fol. 32. a. pl. 5.13. Ed. 3. tit. Utlarie 49. and
elsewhere often. But anciently also part of it is taken for judgment of loss
of life, and part for loss of member only. as in Westminster. 1. cap. 15. -- pur le
quel un ne doit perdre vie ne membre. And Bracton speaking of punishments lib.
3. tit. de Actionibus cap. 6. says sunt quaedam quae adimunt vitam, vel
membrum, and the like has he in tract. de Corona cap. 36 maiora crimina
aliquando vltimum inducunt supplicium aliquando membroru^ truncationem. One
flying to a Sanctuary by the laws of William 1. had pais de vie and de membre,
as the words of it are in the book of Crowland. And amissio membrorum was a
special punishment of Rape before Westminster. 2. as you see in Bracton l. 3. tract.
de Corona cap. 28. He that was condemned lost his Eyes and his Stones. but by
Glanvil, before Bracton, it appears it was death, lib. 14. ca. 6. But, that the
judgment de vie and de membre in Westminster. 2. cap. 38. was only judgment to be
hanged, and meant, about that time, to be so, is plain by the book attributed to
Breton cap. 14. where the author has reference to the statut of Westminster. 2. made
in 13. Edw. 1. which observe also for another purpose. Its commonly affirmed,
with one consent, that John le Breton Bishop of Hereford under Hen. 3. and Ed.
1. wrote that book. But its clear that this John the Bishop was dead ten years
before the stat. of Westminster. 2. here cited. For he died in 3. Edw. 1. which the
story of Florilegus the Monk of Westminster enough iustifies, yet, that no
scruple in that may remain, its to be proved also by infallible record. In
Rot. Pat. 3. Ed. 1. memb. 203. the conge d'slier, for choice of a new Bishop
there, relates quod cum ecclesia vestra Herefordensis pastoris solatio per
mortem bonae memoriae Iohannis nuper Herefordensis Episcopi sit destituta,
alium vobis eligendi in Episcopum etc. this was 23. Maij; and in memb. 19. of
the same roll, the royal assent is given to the choice of Thomas de Cantilupe
successor to John le Breton being dead. All this is most certain. and it is as
certain, that, about that time, was a Judge of this name. for in Rot. Claus.
51. Hen. 3. memb. 12. Mandatum est Richardo de Ewell and Hugoni de Turri
Emptori Garderobae domini Regis quod habere faciat dilectis and fidelibus suis
Iohanni le Breton and Henrico de Monteforti Institiarijs suis Robas suas
integras prout caeteris Iustitiarijs domini Regis invenire consueuit, quamdiu
steterint in Officio domini Regis. and the Dors. Rot. Pat. of that year has
most frequent mention of John le Breton, and Henry de Bracton for Judges of
special assizes. He is sometimes called Bretun, then Briton, and also Breton.
and Florilegus sub anno 1275. Obijt hoc anno Johannes Bretoun episcopus
Herefordensis, qui admodum peritus in iuribus Anglicanis, librum de eis
conscripsit, qui vocatur le Bretoun. That there was a Judge of that name, and
that about that time one of that name was Bishop of Hereford, here appears
plainly, and that a book of common law called le Bretoun was written, and by
the Bishop, if you believe the Monk and the consent of late writers which speak
of it. But what book ever the Bishop wrote, it cannot be this we have now left
under that name, unless you will allow that one dying in 3. Edw. 1. could cite
a statut of 13. Edw. 1. as our Breton does in this of Rape, or the statut of 6.
Edw. 1. of Cessauit at Gloucester, as he does in his chapter de purchase
conditionel, or the stat. of Winchester of 13. Edw. 1. as he does touching high
ways, in his chapter de plusors torts. Some other author then, then the Bishop
of Hereford, must be sought for that volume. This, by the way. For Judgment de
membre, anciently it was in Appeals of Maihem. to this day the count is
felonice, but nothing but damages are now recouerable, nor was the law
otherwise under Ed. 3. as appears by 22. Assis. pl. 82. 41. Assis. pl. 16. and
other books But before that time, the party attainted lost membre pur membre as
its said 18. Ed. 3. fol. 20. a. pl. 31. with which agrees Breton cap. 25. where
is added si la pleint soit faite de femme que auera toll a home ses members,
en tiel case perdra le semme la vne mein per judgment, come le membre d'ont el
auera trespass. and if a Knight were struck by a Ribaud per felony sans
desert de chiualer, the Ribaud (says the book) was to loose his hand* and it
appears in Glanvil lib 14. cap. 1. and Bract. lib. 3. tract. de Corona cap. 24.
that the trialls of mayhem were by duel or Ordells, as of capital offenses.
See infra page 87. where if the husband had been, by judgment, demembratus, the
wife lost her dower. and, for particulars, see there more, and the notes. By K.
Knouts laws cap. 50. Adultery in the woman was punished by loss of Nose and
Ears, to which, it seems, reference is in that of William 1. his laws in
thems. Ingulphus, ^ femme est iudgee a mortu a defaciun des members Kiseit
enceintee, that justice should not be executed till she be delivered, which in
judgment of death is law at this day. and in Fleta lib. 1. ca. 38. for petit
larcenies, or cutting of purses with nothing in them, the Pillorie and loss of
Ears was the punishment. See 10. Hen. 3. tit. Corone 434. And, in Fleta lib.
2. cap. 5. of every common whore following the Court, the Marshall, at the
first apprehension, was to exact 4. d. at the second, to bring her before the
Steward, who was to take her name and forbid her the Court; at the third,
considerabitur quod amputetur ei tressorium, and quoth tondeatur; at the fourth,
amputentur ei superlabia, ne de caetero concupiscantur ad libidinem. At this
day, saving for striking in the presence of the King or his Courts, no loss of
member is in use by course of common law. Ancient and late examples are of
punishment of such striking by loss of the right hand, in 22. Ed. 3. fol. 13.
a. 19. Edw. 3. tit. Judgment 174.39. Assis. pl. 1.33. Hen. 4. Br. tit. Pain
16. Stamford fol. 38. a. and 2. and 3. Elizab. Die. fol. 188. b. By late
statuts, for some offenses the hand, or ^ares are to be cut off.

Ib. Curiam Regis Maiorem.] He calls that Curia Mayor here, which has conisans
of all capital offenses. and in his following chapters the same name he uses
for the Court whither, by Pone, a suit in a writ of right is to be remoud, that
is clearly the common pleas. and Bracton fol. 105. has loquela a Comitatu
transferri potest ad magnam Curiam, where often to him Magna Curia is the
common pleas plainly. so does he use the same title in fol. 332.. 14. and often
elsewhere. But it seems, that to Hengham, Mayor Curia is no singular name for
any one Court, but for any of those of the Kings highest Courts, which have
that name in regard of all inferior. and the subject which he speaks of with
it, may design what court he means. as here, that he means the Kings bench,
or Aula Regia (as Bracton calls it fol. 105. b.. 2.) appears by the crimes
recited afterward; when he talks of a Pone to remove the suit of a writ of
right into Mayor Curia, there it must be the common pleas. and it seems in
page ^6. he takes the name expressly as well for the Court of Justices in
Eire, as for the Common pleas. Note the words: Quamvis essonium de malo lecti
in maiori Curia Domini Regis, vtpote ad Bancum vel in Itinere Iustitiariorum
iaci debeat tertio die etc.

Ib. Placita vero de furtis.] How the law has been since taken touching pleas
of the Crown to be Viscontiel, is taught in Stamford lib. 1. cap. vlt. and lib.
2. cap. 14. No capital offense was, by this opinion, to be heard and determined
in the County. For though he name Furta here, it seems, he means not that
theft which is capital, but as Furtum is in the Civil law, so he understands
it. that is, only for wrongful taking away goods, as the word Roberie is vsd
in Westminster. 1. cap. 37. And all other kind of felonious taking our author
comprehends before, in Roberia; which in those times expressed also all
felonious taking, or Furtum in that sense, as its now vsd. witness Bracton
cited by Stamford fol. 27. b. yet in Glanvil lib. 1. cap. 2. Furtum is excepted
to the Shirifs Court, as out of such offenses quae vltimo puniuntur supplicio
aut membrorum truncatione. It Is no doubt but Hengham, in writing this, had
regard to Glanvil. as it may appear by the same words in both. so had Bracton
speaking of this matter, lib. 3. tract. de Corona fol. 154. b. Ad vicecomitem
pertinent huiusmodi placita in Comitatu. Cognoscere quidem potest de medletis,
plagis, verberibus, and consimilibus, nisi quaerens adijciat de pace domini
Regis infracta, vel feloniam apponat. Extunc n. se vicecomes non debet
intromittere, cum hoc tangat personam ipsius domini Regis and coronam suam.
But, he says the Coroners were to inroll Appeals of capital offenses, and
present them in the Eire. So that in those times, by Bractons opinion, if one
had sued criminally in the county, and concluded contra pacem domini Regis,
etc. the Court had not jurisdiction, but if contra pacem vicecomiti^, then it
had. so is his difference there and page 145. b. For in the one case, Judgment
de vie ou de membre or imprisonment was to follow in the other only
amerciament, or poena pecuniaria, as he calls it. But see this author page 21.
where he speaks of appells sine breui. Appeals then might be taken or
commenced, but not determined, in the County, if they were de pace Regis
fracta* so it seems. See Stat. Mag. Chart. cap. 17. which belongs hither.
Neither is it amiss to remember a judgment given in the time of Hengham, and
before him in 30. Edw. 1. not from the matter here spoken of. It is in P. 30.
Ed. 1. ms. fol. 280. a. where the Shirife of Yorkshire is commanded que il
feist vener le appel Ion de Morton ensemblem^t oue Ion de Thouthorp attache per

secundum legem and consuetudinem regni, mayor and Coronatores alicuius
Ciuitatis huiusmodi appella coram eis audire non possunt, and terminare, nisi
eorum cognitio per Cartam domini Regis vel progenitorum eius vel per breue
domini Regis de huiusmodi appello coram eis audiendo and terminando specialiter
sit co^cessa, cum ea ad dominum Regem ratione iuris sui Regij and non ad alium,
in Regno Regis, pertineant, Consideratum est quod appellum praedictum coram
ipsis Maiori and Coronatoribus habitum, tanquam coram eis qui nullum in
huiusmodi casu habe^t iurisdictionem adnulletur and pro nullo habeatur. Et quia
praedicti mayor and Coronatores nullam in Curia hic manuopus vel pelfrum
proferunt nec Idem Johannes de Morton solempn^ter voc^tus appellum praedictum
in Curia hic prosequitur, Visum est Curiae quoth ad sectam domini Regis versus
praedictum Iohannem de Thouthorp in Curia hic non est proeedendum. Et ideo
praedictus Johannes de Thouthorp inde sine die. Et ad iudicium de praedictis
Maiore and Coronatoribus qui appellum illud tenuerunt sine warranto. These are
the words of my report very anciently written. I transcribd it all, because
diverse things are in it specially obseruable.

Ib. Melletis.] Glanvil and Bracton have de Medletis, for sudden affraies or
dislikes* the word is so vsd too in Regiam May. l. 1. ca. 3. and hence is
our Chance medley, corrupted from Chaud melle, which signifies hot or sudden
debate. whence, in Scotland, Chaud melle is opposd against Forethought felony,
as Manslaughter with us, against Murder. See Skene ad citat. loc. and de verb.
signific. But, Chance medley is in Stamford otherwise. Skeen interprets Chaud
melle by Rixa in the Civil law.

Ib. Hutesio] Although clamor and Hutesium or Huesium is for huy and cry in our
law, yet it seems here its a word made from Hutin, i. scol^ing, brawling,
contention, whereby the peace of the county was disturbd. For all the rest
here spoken of are offenses, among which you cannot well reckon Huy and Cry.
although of that the Shirif had power to determine, if it grew in question
twixt the appellant and appellee vtrum appellans hutesium leuauerit, Bract.
lib. 3. fol. 145. b.. 2.

Ib. vbi non agitur de pace domini Regis fracta] He means, when the plaintiff or
appellant did not complain of the kings peace broken, but only of the peace of
the shirife* so Bracton teaches the law of that time, that if, for the like,
suits were in inferior Lords courts the conclusion was contra pacem Domini, if
in the court of a corporation, contra pacem Balliuoru^, if in the shirifs,
contra pacem Vicecomitis. Neither means Hengham that those offenses were not in
themselves contra pacem Regis, but that in the suit commenced in the Shirifs
court the Kings peace broken might not be co^plaind of. which well agrees
with, and explanes the law now, that, without writ, the shirif cannot hold plea
de transgressionibus contra pacem domini Regis, as it appears in Fitzh. Na. Br
fol. 47. A.

Page 9. hanc Assisam.] supposing the mise be put on the grand assise.

Ib falsat.] that is, by oath prove that the Lords court has faild him of
right. the two following chapters have more of it. and see Bracton lib. 5. fol.
329. and 330. where the falsifying (as it was called) of the Lords court is by
oath taken by the demandant, with two others, in the Lords court, or at his
manor house; but Hengham allows it by the oath only of the party this Bracton
styles defalta probata. Touching this obsolet usage, a case of 11. Hen. 2. is
worth observation. Its related in Roger de Houeden page 283. when Thomas
Becket desired the King, he might, with his leave, go visit Pope Alexander
then commorant in France, the King answered him Tu prius respondebis mihi de
iniuria quam fecisti Iohanni Marischallo meo in Curia tua. Conquestus n. erat
Regi idem Johannes quod, cum calumniatus esset in Curia Archiepiscopi terram
quandam de illo tenendam iure haereditario, and diu inde placitasset, nullam
inde potuit assequi iustitiam, and quod ipse Curiam Archiepiscopi
falsificauerit secundum consuetudinem regni, cui Archiepiscopus respondit,
nulla Iustitia defuit Iohanni in Curia mea, sed ipse (nescio cuius consilio an
propriae voluntatis motu) attulit in curia meae quendam Toper and iurauit super
illum, quod ipse pro defectu Iustitiae a Curia mea recessit, and videbatur
Iustitiarijs curiae meae, quod ipse inuriam mihi fecit, quia sic a Curia mea
recessit, cum statutum sit in regno vestro, Quod qui curiam alterius
falsificare voluerit oportet eum iurare super sacrosancta euangelia. Rex
quidem, non respiciens ad verba haec, iurauit, quod ipse haberet de eo
iustitiam and Iudicium. Et Barons curiae Regis iudicauerunt eum esse in
misericordia Regis, and quamvis Archiepiscopus nit^retur iudicium illud
falsificare, tamen prece and consilio Baronum posuit se in misericordia Regis
de D. libris and invenit ei fideiussores. That Toper was a Church book of the
time, and it is what in a Constitution of Robert Winchelsey is called Troperium
in Lindw. Prouinc. constit. tit. de Eccles. aedific. ^. vt Parochiani. Of this
falsifying, more in Breton fol. 275 according to Bracton. and the seruiens
domini Regis in Bracton appears to be Bailife of the hundred or some such
minister.

Ib. Iustiti^rij ad omnia placita.] Justices in Eires which were in some like
nature to the now Justices of assise, but had not their circuits so often. The
beginning of them was in 22. Hen. 2. which was by example after followed. See
Houeden page 3^3. and 337. and Geruas. Tilburiens. in Dialogo de scaccario. But
it seems great delay of justice might so have been. For the Eires were not
very frequent. and by some, the distance of them was VII. years. So says
Scrope in Temps Edw. 3. fol. 143. a. and see fol. 149. a. Aldenham. Glanvil
speaks not of them in this case. it being not in use in the infancy of Eires,
to have the prohibemus referrd to them. succeeding time brought in that; and
about Ed. 3. the Eires were left.

Ib. ad Corporale sacramentum ponere etc.] Bracton fol. 106. a. Non potest
aliquis Baro, vicecomes vel alius de liberis tenementis cognoscere, nec tenens
tenetur respondere sine praecepto vel warranto domini regis nec possunt aliquem
de huiusmodi ad sacramentum sine warranto compellere. See Stat. Marlb. cap.

Hengham page 45.

Ib. Anno bissextili.] The four excresscent quadrants of a day in the Julian
year were and are at the end of every four years space, put into one day,
which added to the 365. of the common year makes 366. for the Leap or
bissextile year. the addition was not to the end of the year, but the day is so
intercalculated in February, that it falls to be ioind with the VI. Kalends of
March, which being every fourth year so made of two days ioind, denominated
their year with bissextus, because eo anno bis diceretur sexto Kl. Martias.
That ordinance of the Leap year after spoken of, is dated apud windeshore 10.
die Maij anno regni nostri 54. by Hen. 3. in the old statuts. See for this
matter Bracton fol. 344. b. and 359. b. In the Roman Civil law, the like
account was of the intercalated day, and it, with that wherewith it was ioind,
was as one day. Vlpian in p. tit. de minoribus l. 3. denique. 3. Proinde si in

Ib. Affidatis in manibus.] read affidati. The Affidauits here are taken in
manibus vel super virgam clamatoris. For that in manibus see Bracton speaking
of falsifying the Lords court fol. 329. b. Vadiata probatione defaltae in manum
seruientis domini Regis.

Page 33. l. 4. delicto alterius* Ex etc.] read delicto alterius, ex* etc. What
he means by this, appears not clear enough. Of Pleas determinable per legem
n^w, none is whereupon imprisonment should follow. In alder times indeed Ley
gager (if you take legem here for that) was a trial in many actions which now
admit it not. as in attachment upon a prohibition 24. Ed. 3. fol. 39. a. and
see 28 Ed. ^. fol. 100. a. 18. Ed. 3. fol. 4. a. 2. Ed. 3. fol. 8* b. 48. Ed.
3. fol. 6. a. and in Placit Assis. apud Northampt. 31. Hen. 3. Coram Rogero de
Thurkelby and socijs suis Rot. 11. in dorso. Geruase de Bernake brings a writ
of Mesne against Peeter de Bernake, and the tenant confesses cause of
acquitall, but says the demandant was not distraind through his default, which
plea is tried by his law. And in a roll in the Tower indorsed Circa 34. Hen. 3.
Rot. 7. in a writ de Fine facto by Matthew de Stratton against Ralf Mautanner
about a common, in the count the defendant was charged with using the common
otherwise then the fine would; he pleads he did (...) use it otherwise Et
offert se defendere contra ipsum and sectam suam sicut curia considerauerit.
Ideo consideratum est quod vadiet ei legem se XII. manu, and veniat cum lege
sua a die sancti Hillarij in XV. dies and plegij de lege Willielmus Branthe and
Willielmus filius Roberti. Postea a die Paschae in III. septimanas venit
praedictus Radulphus and fecit legem suam; ideo Consideratum est quoth praedictus
Radulphus inde sine die and Matthaeus in misericordia. Thus different were
ancient times from the present. But what had this Ley gager to do with
imprisonment spoken of in this author? Quaere. Or does he mean by legem, the
arrainment on criminal offenses, which being not capital are punished by
imprisonment? Poni ad legem is a usual phrase in old rolls, especially in that
of 31. Hen. 3 now cited, for one to be arraind, or put to answer to criminal
offenses.

Page 34. Non pleuine.] This is remedied by the stat. of 9. Ed. 3. cap. 4.

Page 37. secundum Henricum de Bathonia.] A Justice of Henry 3. his time is
obuious in the rolls, of that name. But this point of Ley gager against the
testimony of the summoners is in Henry de Bracton fol. 334. b. He cites him
again page 38.47. and 60.

matter is in Bracton fol. 355.3. Hen. 3. tit. Essoine 186.14. Hen. 3. Essoin

might not rise before his being seen by the 4. Knights, which if he did, and
were not found in his bed when they came to make their view, his essoin was
turned into a default, of which also is a notable case of 16. Rich. 1. in the
book of Crowland, where Henry de longo Campo Abbot, though being in possession,
yet sued the Prior of Spalding for entering upon his Marsh contra pacem Regiam,
the Prior pleades, he enterd as into his own see simple, and offers 40. marks
for the grand assise. and the mise is ioind so. The Abbot is essoind de malo
lecti. The writ goes out to the 4. Knights to make the view. while one is
coming to view him he rises, and comes toward the court. the Knight certified
he could not find him in his bed, whereupon judgment was given after long
consideration quod Abbas Crowlandiae qui se essoniauit contra Priorem de
Spalding de malo lecti apud Crowland, and illic non est inuentus in lecto,
quando visus deberet de eo fieri, amitteret ad tempus seisinam. Note, seisin
was upon his default given to the defendant in the suit. The whole plea and
story of it is long, but most worthy the reading, to instruct in the Courts,
Courses of that time, and specially in processes sent out by the L. Chief
Justice of England, in his own name, sitting with the Justices in Banco. Diverse
whole writs from the king beyond sea, and from the Chief Justice at home, are
in it, and the whole is very understandingly related.

legem is here to be able to take a legal oath, and facere legem (as at this
day) to take it. See in the Notes to Fortescue, of legem terrae. By Bracton

Page 72. tenetur donator and eius haeredes] so must you read. so was the law
in feofments before the statut of Quia emptores etc. when a tenure was reserud
to the feoffors. See Stat. de Bigamis cap. 6.13. Ed. 1. apud West. tit.
Garranty 92. and 13. Ed. 1. tit. Uoucher 290.

Page 73. residuas duas C. vel D.] Its supposd by this, that the other land, of
which the feoffor is seisd at the feoffment might be bound by the warranty
comprehended in the deed. So also was the law taken in 16. Hen. 3. in the case
of Alice de Ware reported by Bracton fol. 382. a. being (it seems) the same
with 17. Hen. 3. tit. Recovery en value 25. and see 32. Ed. 1. tit. Uoucher
29^. But its plain now, no land is bound but what the feoffor or his heir has
at the time of the Uoucher, or Warranty de chartres brought.

Page 79. Tempore Regis Henrici] But that in the margin (as some copies are)
agrees with the law of Westminster. 1. cap. 39. wherein, the writ of right was

Page 87. infalistatus.] It appears that several customs of places, made in
those days, capital punishments several. But, what is infalistatus? in
regard its of a custom vsd in a Port town, I suppose it was made out of the
French word Falaize, which is fine sand by the water side, or a bank of the
sea. in this sand or bank it seems their execution, at Dover, was. In this
place the copies vary. no one having all the punishments. but for the raritie
of the remembrance, I took out of diverse copies all these. The old English
translation here helped not.

Ib. vel apud Winton demembratus.] that is of his Eyes and Stones. For, such
was anciently the punishment of Felons in Winchester; as also in Walingford.
One authority iustifies both in 45. Hen. 3. Berk. Coram Gilberto de Preston and
socijs suis in Oct. Purif. B. Mariae Rot. 29. the Jurors of the Borough of
Walingford give in quod nullus de natione istius Burgi pro quocunque facto quod
fecerit, debet suspendi, imo secundum consuetudinem istius Burgi debet Oculis
and Testiculis priuari, and tali liberate vsi sunt a tempore quo non extat
memoria, and so they there say one Benedict Heruey was lately so punished. Et,
quaesiti Iuratores, si tali liberate vsi sunt; dicunt quod a tempore Henrici
aui domini Regis nunc vsi fuerunt eadem liberate per Cartam eiusdem D. Regis
quam eis fecit per quam eis concessit omnes libertates quas Ciuitas Winton
habet etc. They challenged this liberty from a Charter of Hen. 2. who gave
them all such liberties as Winchester had.

Ib. Decapitatus.] See Regist. Orig. fol. 165. a. and Fitzh. Not. Br. fol. 144.
H. of beheading for felony.

Ib. vbi quis mouet Guerram etc.] See 8. Ed. 3. fol. 388. a. 7. Hen. 4. fol.
32. b. and 47. a. 15. Ed. 3. tit. Peticion 2. Plowd. Comm. fol. 263. a. the
sadlers case in Rep. 4. fol. 57. b. Stamford fol. 189. and Park.. 391.

Page 88. Item siminor etc.] By this, and what Glanvil has lib. 7. c. 12. it
appears that in those times greater prejudice was often to the heirs of both
sexes, by marriage without their Lords consent, then the law since burdens them
with.

Ib. dotem deseruire.] that is demereri. By such uncertainty, without
limitation of years, those old autors iudgd of a woman's dower. so Bracton l. 2.
c. 39. Breton c. 109. And by the Roman law non potest videri nupta quae virum
pati non potest. in so much that if a legacy be given to a young girl, to be
paid quando nupserit, if she take a husband before she be viripotens, the
legacy is not yet due, by express text in p. tit. Quando dies legate. vel
fideicomisscedat l. 30. quoth pupilla. So in the Reg. May. of Scotland lib. 2.
cap. 17. a woman looses her dower si sit ita iuuenis, quod non potest habere
rem, hoc est, coire cum viro suo. But in our year books diverse cases are of
later time touching a certainty of years, and now it is taken usually (as
Litleton says) she must be above nine. Besides the common autorities, see
Fleta lib. 5. cap. 22* and for the two cases of this matter, in 7. Ed. 2. tit.
Dower 147. and 12. Edw. 2. tit. eod. 159. they are worth more observation in
the report at large, which is extant in our Inner Temple Library. the first is
between Symond and Benster fol. 107. a. the second is fol. 163. b. where Berry
says expressly, that it lies in the discretion of the Judges, whether she
deserve dower or no.

Ib. requiritur longa seisina and pacifica.] for in those times the law was
taken, both that long seisin so added a title to a disseisin, that the
disseisee might not enter, and also, by some, that short seisin of one that had
right to enter, gave him not so much freehold that he might have his assise
against a disseisor. so it appears in 12. Hen. 3. Itin. Staff. tit. Assise 428.
and 429. 30. Edw. 1. Itin. Cornub. tit. Attaint. 76. Bracton fol. 160. and 161.
Hengham page 98. But see Breton chap. 42. to which (that we may observe the
opinions of that time) add a case, adjudged before our Author, upon this point
of Longa or brenis seisina, and reuerst in the kings bench. In 33. Ed. 1. ms.
fol. 59. b. John le fitz Aueline brought a Mort d' ancestor before Sir Ralph de
Hengham and his compagnions, of the death of John le Clark his uncle, against
Edmond of London gardein of the house of Saint Thomas of Acres. the tenant
pleads pluis darrain seisin in Aueline mother to the demandant, who was seized
after the death of the uncle. Issue upon this is ioind, and the Assise taken;
they find que apres la mort mesme cel^y Ion le Clerk meme cesty Au^line tant
come le corpse fust en la bear entra and l'eins fust reclamant come heir Ion and
per un demi hour de iour ydemurra tan que sur l'emporter du corpse, ou ele se
voleit estre l'eins tenus, vient le dit Emon and la osta. so are the words in
my copy, very anciently written. and to Sir Ralph and his companions (says
the book) it seemd that cele petite seisin and en teu temps ne fust null, and so
they adjudged that the demandant should recover. But by writ of error, and upon
the very point, that judgment was reuerst quia sola (as the report is) pedis
positio vero haeredi seisinam contulit, cy agard la court que Edmond reeit sa
seisin etc. and ses damages, and eit Ion son rescouerir per autre voie sil
voile. And this reuersall agrees well with what our author has in the beginning
of this chapter. See 3. Ed. 3. in Vet. Not. Br. fol. 126. b. in Dum fuit infra
aetatem. But now its plain law, that the lest time is enough for seisin to him
that has right to enter, as in 8. Assis. pl. 25.26. Assis. pl. 42. and
elsewhere. The true meaning of transfertur liberum tenementum in feoffatum etc.
in Stat. Westminster. 2. cap. 29. may be had out of this old opinion* see infra page
99.

Page 103. extra Astrum] All this passage, in the same words, is in Fleta lib.
4. cap. 2. whereby, Astrum must be taken for the Lords dwelling house, or such
like. See the customs of Kent; in particion, there, le astre demor^a al pune
etc. page 574. The elder times had also homo Astrarius for a householder (as I
guess) or in such like signification. Bracton lib. 2. cap. 36.. 7. speaking of
payment of releifs; Esto quod haeres sit astrarius, vel quoth aliquis antecessor
restituat haeredi in vita sua haereditatem and se dimiserit, videtur quod nullo
tempore iacebit haereditas. as if he had said, suppose the heir be householder,
or, as tenant to the Lord in life of his ancestor etc. and in Fleta lib. 1.
cap. 47. Frithborgh est laudabilis homo astrarius. and extra astrum in them, is
to Bracton, extra potestatem dominorum fol. 165. and 166.

Page 104. Sokemannus.] This also is in Fleta lib. 4. cap. 2. and agrees with
that which is called Tractatus de antiquo dominico, and in a very old English
translation of the statuts is titled a statut. being indeed only some lawiers
answer (or in the nature of Ciuilians Consilia, or such like) to questions
proposd touching ancien demesne. But the law in the year books is clear, that
to any real actions or savoring of the realty, auncien demesne is a good plea.
See Bracton fol. 272. and Breton cap. 66. de Gardes.

THE END.
