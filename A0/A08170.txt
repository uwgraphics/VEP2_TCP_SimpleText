A NEW SVRVEY OF THE AFFAIRS of EVROPE.

WITH Other remarkable accidents, not yet published by the ordinary Posts, but
faithfully collected out of Letters of credit and good Relations.

LONDON, Printed for Nathaniel Butter, Bartholomew Downs, and Thomas Archer.

From Constantinople.
WHereas you have a long time expected some relation of news, and discourses
concerning the affairs of Europe; alas, you must consider what you do, when
you come into a well furnished Garden, you see the frost and the snow has
nipped the flowers, and there is scarce any appearance either of sweet herbs
or flourishing plants: only the roots remain safe in the ground, and
peradventure at the spring through the warmth of the Sun, and the nature of
the soil assume as it were new life, and show forth some beautiful
hansomnesse, so has the winter dealt with the affairs of Europe, the Soldiers
have been glad of refreshing, and the Princes taken care to make them strong
with ease and quietness, but now the Spring coming forward, and the storm of
cold ouer-blowne, you shall see peradventure the roots to receive a strange
freshness, and new business, show you a face both of terror and pleasure:
till when I will be bold to unseal certain Letters which shall tell you of
certain well manured grounds, which even this winter have brought forth some
flowers, and simple although they prove Antipathies in nature to some
constitutions: the Letters then from Constantinople assure us thus much, that
whereas Daout Bashaw, the setter up of Mustapha, after the strangling of Osman,
who had married one of the daughters of the Empress, proiected not only the
government of the Empire, but the ouerruling of the Emperor: yea peradventure
the advancing of his posterity to the throne of Othoman, by foisting in a son
of his own, and then to strangle the young brothers of Osman, and so to follow
with the death of Mustapha. The new Viceer, called Huzein Bashaw, coming from
Gran Cairo, as a giver of Antidotes to the poison of these turmoiles, had no
better means to adnance the frame of his greatness, then to call Daout Bashaw
and the Empress in question for so perfidious a plot, and dangerous a treason:
The woman either transformed her self, and so was obscured: or corrupted the
Officers of State, and so was remitted; or confessed all to the principal
Mufty, and so was pardoned. But the Bashaw, the Ianisaries not enduring his
Apology, was presently cut in pieces: so that Mustapha after many changes is
now in the hands of Huzein Bashaw, who taking example by the former
affrightings, hides as yet his panther taients of policy concerning the
augmentation of his own honor, and falls directly to the setting upright
the staggering Commonwealth, and adding as it were a tincture to the beauty of
the Othoman glory, wherein he has proceeded in such a manner, and with so rare
a discipline, that when he sacrificed as it were 200. Ianisaries, who had
been delinquents in the murder to the ghost of Osman, all the rest endured
the punishment and gave a plaudit to his loyalty. Mustapha in the mean time
sits like a shadow, and is glad of the peace which Huzein Bashaws government
has established, loving him because he has effected the observation of the
Soldiers toward him, and fearing himself because he has already seen what
the malignity of time has done, and the insolent Soldier is ready to put in
practice.

For even the other day when the people were distasted with Mustaphus
pusillanimity, and remembered the heroicke sprightfulnesse of murdered Osman,
when they heard of the tumults of Asia, and the suspicious reuolts of the
Bashawes of Aleppo and Babylon, when some had whispered in their ears, O what
a difference is there between the magnanimous countenance and maiesticall
presence of Osman, and the dejected aspect of Mustapha, who men would judge to
be fitter for a Monastry then a Palace; or to pray in a Cel rather then rule in
a Throne: they suddenly called for the sight of Osmans brethren, who very
politikely without any delay Huzein Bashaw brought out of the Serali^, and
advanced in the Hippodrame, assuring the soldiers, that neither it was
Mustaphaes pleasure, nor any motives of Superiors, either to obscure them or
disappoint them: only there was reason by no means to dislocate Mustapha now
reigning, considering their young years, and the suspicious troubles of the
confining Princes. For if any new tumults should arise out of the advantages of
disorder, God knows what the Persian might do in Asia and Arabia, and the
Emperor and King of Poland in Hungary and Transiluania, considering they had
already thriued against their enemies on every side: therefore he commanded
them to quietness and silence, and demand of him an account of the Princes,
when occasion should serve. In this manner was his wisdom so seasonable, that
the flames of this new sedition were delicately quenched: the Princes returned
to the palace: Mustapha established in the Throne, himself prevailed with
their good opinion, and the whole body of the Ianizaries recovered from the
growing infection of reuolts and disorder, so that the city was suddenly
quieted, and all good government observed.

Much about this time, which was in October last, some will have the Persian
Ambassador to ariue; as well to gratefie the new enthronized Mustapha, as to
renew the old and customary treaties of peace: some again say there was no new
Ambassador, but that the Ligier there, had several directions from Persia,
both to present the Emperor certain gifts, and to gratefie the Viceer for his
indulgent care over the Commonwealth, in so dangerous and suspicious times of
innovation. And also to associate himself with the English Ambassador, and
present him with a Target of gold, and other gifts in behalf of the Sophy his
Lord, and by reason of the services, the English had done him at Ormus, who
thereupon took a convenient time, and by way of Visitation came unto him,
using these or the like speeches.

My Lord
I am commissioned from my great Master, The Persian Ambassador to the English
Ambassador.
the Sophy of Persia, not only to visit you, but gratefie you with such
presents as befitteth him to bestow, and you to receive: the motives arising
from the high deseruings of your nation, and the noble renoune of your Prince:
For if Merchants or if you please Merchants Factors, can merit so well of fame,
as to equal great Commanders in heroic actions, what do the Nobles and
Gentiles deserve, who questionless give good example to the rest, and cannot
but rejoice the kings heart to have such subjects, and worthy soldiers: but to
the purpose. The traffic of silk being long since settled at Ormus, the
Portingalls possessing certain places about Iasques, on the Eastern side of
the Persian Gulf, and challenged by the great Mogull of the hither India, not
only debarred all comers as men say, but by extraordinary means, and force
surprised the Castle, and Island of Ormus: which when my great Lord understood
after mature confideration, as unwilling to endure the indignity, besides the
loss of his prerogatives and customs, he capitulated with the English, and
upon certain conditions by way of salary entertainment, admitted them to his
service, and committed the managing of the affairs to their endeavors; so an
army was prepared, but because the Castle could not be obtained, nor the Island
cleared without great Ordnance, and that the English ships lay so conveniently
in the Gulf, he likewise hired their Ordnance, and after many skirmishes,
time and their own valor, mounted two hundred pieces, and banded three
hundred men, who demeaned themselves so valiantly, and bestowed their shot so
effectually, that by degrees we were Lords of the Island, and absolute Masters
of the town; the Portingals not able to endure the encounters, nor brave
assaults without loss and some slaughters.

Thus by degrees they won the Island, and expulsed the Portugals out of the
Town, nothing remaining but the fortified Castle, which was detained but a
while; for the defendants foreseeing an utter destruction by holding out,
considering our Persians were every where so malicious and violent against
them, gained the saving of their lives by orderly composition, and so quite
abandoned the place, and we were quickly masters of all; which without flattery
or other insinuation, it pleases my great Master to attribute to the wisdom
and unmatchable valor of the English, and for which he has recompensed every
man according to his deserving, and is contented that the traffic for Silk
shall remain free to the English, and half the customs of the Town and Island
of Ormus be as it were a yearly compensation to the East India Company at your
City of London. And thus much for Constantinople.

From Poland.
You have often heard how the Tartars and Cossacks of Bogdonia and Poland live
for the most part upon spoil and robberies of Merchants, except the wars
employ them, or they employ themselves to the services of other Princes, which
custom it seems they still retain: for even the other day as bad men (though
enemies) soon agree to commit outrages, and any villainy to enrich themselves:
so did they combine to forage into Russia, and went so far, and prevailed so
well, that if an embucy from Mosio had not acquainted King Sigismond with the
mischief and forcible attempts they had questionless kindled a fire which a
great deal of water could not have quenched: but thus disappointed at that
time, and understanding of a truce and limited peace between the King of
Poland and King of Sweden, and that also the Emperor of Germany, though there
were great preparations for war, was unwilling to entertain them, or to
endure their unruliness either in Hungary or Bohemia, they went another way to
work, and concluded with the Tartars to lay a Plot upon the City of Leopolis,
which being discovered by certain poor Pedlars men and women of the same
trade the Inhabitants prevented. For understanding of their abode and places of
association, they made a brave sally, and by the assistance of the Villages,
not only dissipated their meetings and disappointed their pretended villainy,
but put diverse of them to the sword, and by many fearful slaughters compelled
them out of those Confines, so that they were enforced to hide themselves in
the woods, and fly to the borders of the black Sea.

From Transiluania.
AS after great winds and fearful tempests, though the air is calm, and
they seem appeased, the Sea yet remains turbulent, and the billows mount a
great while: so fared it with the business and affairs of Turkey, though the
City was quieted, and the Ianizaries seemed appeased, yet every man was almost
affrighted, and the whispering Troops amassed the Bashawes, as if the confining
Princes were up in arms, not only to take revenge, as acting one another
part on such traitors as durst lay hands upon their Prince, and such a Monarch;
but to work their own ends for such places, and recovery of such Countries,
as the Turks had usurped both in Persia and Christendom.

Whereupon the Vizier Hazein Basshaw by way of prevention very cautelous
demeaned himself, and in the name of his Emperor Mustapha sent out his
several Ambassadors for the renouation of those ancient contracts and
conditions of peace between the Princes of Asia and Europe, and yet retayning
the majesty of the Othoman glory, he insinuated with none, but the Persian,
and Emperor of Germany: only he laid a strict command upon the Basshawes of
the Provinces, both to maintain the dignity of the Commonwealth, and the
peace of the Cities.

Among whom the Ambassador that came to the Emperor, not only obtained a
resolute combination of peace, but a fair admission of amity, insomuch that
the Transiluanian Prince had a relaxation of his tribute, and augmentation of
his government, so that he thought it meet to compound with the Emperor, that
he might the better prevent the incursions and abuses of the Ianizaries, if
they should in this turbulent time either break into Hungary, or trouble his
own Country: but the Basshaw of Buda being as careful as himself, had
always preparations ready, both to intercept the malignity of time, concerning
his own rebels, and the terror of trouble from the Cofsacks of Poland: in all
which he was countenanced by the Emperor, and emboldned through this new
combination of peace between the Emperor and the great Turk.

From Vienna.
THe Emperor as it were thriuing in all his designs, in the acquisition of the
Palatinate, and the preuailings of Bauaria, especially in the appeasing of a
seditious tumult in Prague, where he showed them the power of a stronger arm,
and taught them this discipline, that the end of treason was death, and
punishment attended the delinquents against the law; seemed yet weary of
extremities, and practiced another way, yea diverse other ways (as I may say)
to corroborate his greatness, and reconcile the affairs of the Commonwealth.
First, he proclaimed peace and quiernesse to all that would return to his
obedience. Secondly, he admitted the Prince of Anholt and many Lords into his
favor; yea he repealed the proscriptions of the Marquess of Iaggendorf, the
Counts of Thorn father and son, and others who had maintained Glatz, and the
revolted Towns of Morauia against him; who yet stood on their guard, and kept
themselves secure in their fast holds. Thirdly, he countenanced the
Protestants in Vienna and many other places, whereby they continued their
assemblies, so that you shall have 50. Coaches at a Sermon: and in Stiria,
Carinthia, Corrinola, Croatia, they meet without fear or danger, yea they pray
for their brethren in the Valtoline: all which he endures, and sees a great
alteration by this quiet course and conniuency. Fourthly, he has changed many
governors both in Morauia and Silesia, and written to the Bishops to be as
sparing in their authortty, as may stand with the dignity of the Roman Church.
Fifthly, he has proclaimed diverse Diets and Assemblies at Auspurg, Regenspurg,
Ratisbona, and other places, whither he has gone with his Empress in person,
and been entertained with triumphs, inuiting as it were the Princes of the
Empire to maintain their accustomed solemnities, and decide the present
controversies for the rectifying the disorders of the Commonwealth. Last of
all, perceiving a kind of thinness in these Assemblies, and that neither
Saxony, Brandenburg, Brunswicke, Hess, nor many other Princes graced the places
with their presence; he caused the Empress to write unto the Duke of Saxony;
whose Letters were to this effect:

My Lord:
The Empress Letter to the Duke of Saxony.
I will neither meddle with the Emperors affairs, nor your discontents; nay I
would not have so much liberty given to a woman, for fear of irregularity,
especially in transcendent business, and above the short reaches of her sex. l
will only challenge my own rights, and take upon me to defend the honor and
prerogative which belongs to my place: I had thought then that for my sake you
would have come to the Diet at Regenspurg, and out of noble respects either
welcomed me into the Country, or given good example to others by your
observation. When I was in my Fathers house, I have heard Gonzala boast of
Saxonies love, and although we had sufficient matter to talk of your
greatness, yet we left all to think of your honor and affinity to the
Emperor. How comes then this slacknesse to visit me that am Gonzalaes sister,
and Ferdinandos wife? Is it because you are offended or distasted with the
affairs? Come a Gods name, and leuiate these tumors; show your griefs, and
justify your Apology, and by the faith of a Princess, whose innocence
warrants your safe conduct, I will not leave kneeling before his Imperial
Majesty; nay our Ladies Altar, until a perfect reconciliation be made, and
your Honor acknowledged to be a great supportation of the Empire.

From the Valtoline.
It has been heretofore generally proclaimed that whosoever would obey the
Church of Rome, and submit to the Spanish government, should have restoration
of estates, and quietness of life; but many contested against it, and the
preuailers turned their admonitions into fury, and ran over the Country with
slaughter: some they beheaded and set upon poles; some they cut out their
tongues, some they punished in other manner, and some they sent into the
inquisition at Millane; amongst whom as the Soldiers in their searches lighted
upon certain Ministers, and Noblemen and women, there was a Gentlewoman of
great years in the rank of our Ladies, fourscore at the least, named
Maddona Paola, who was at the first entreated by many perswasiue reasons to
forsake her Religion and come to the unity of the Mother Church: but her reply
was the Story of the three Children, who would not kneel to Nabuchadnezars
Image, and when they added the terror of the punishment, she smiled in their
faces and told them they should see the Angel to protect her, which answer
they imputed to frenzy and the dotage of her years, and so all enraged and
exasperated, they reviled her and condemned her to the fire, yea to be burnt
in a public Piazza: so the inquisitors went cautelously to work, and not only
bound her hands but gagd her mouth, and so brought her to the stake among them
all: but it should seem the fire had quickly power of her cords and her hands
were as quickly at liberty, so that ere she dyed she showed such signs of
joy and alacrity of spirit, such a lively countenance, such clapping of her
hands, such lifting them up to heaven, such pointing to the people, and then to
heaven, that ere she was confumed to cynders, the thousands of people shed as
many tears, and departed a way murmurring and discontented. In this estate
stands the whole Country of the Grizons at this hour, and so by the advice
of the Swiffe, they have implored the Majesty of France, the Signory of Venice,
the King of Denmark, the Princes of Germany, and the States of the united
Provinces, to speak cheerful things to their souls, and not to see them
subject to the authority of strangers.

From Naples.
AFter the arrival of the Duke of Alua, as Viceroy, and that the Seas were
filled with Galleys and Turkish Carmisans, which Hazein Basshaw had sent abroad
to watch the proceedings of Christian Princes in this time of turbulency on all
sides: the government was so searched and looked into, and yet with that
affability and insinuating care, that the mutinies and seditions formerly
raised, were now appeased, the famine prevented, the Merchant welcomed, diverse
Noblemen discharged out of prison, the factions reconciled, many debts paid,
the money enhawnsed, and a general reformation followed, which once
established, then began a muster in Calabria, Brutia, Apuleia, yea Cicilia it
self, and at last certain troops of horse and Companies listed for any new
emploiment, as the directions of Spain should give them notice: but as yet they
hear of no filuer Fleet arrived: so that in truth, though rumor have been
too lavish in ouer-numbring the Soldiers: yet there is a great probability,
that there shall an army be raised in Italy to attend the Duke of Feria in his
proiects at Millane, where at this hour there is a great suspicion of
reuolting, as you shall hear in due place.

From Rome.
They write from hence, that there was never so Wise, Honorable, and judicious
a Counsel about the Pope, as is now, nor were there Cardinals in their
Conclaue so reposed, and addicted to reformation before: Insomuch that many
enormities have been punished, and both Priests, Friars, and Curtezans,
restrained from that former justifying of their impious lives in so public a
manner, yea many good decrees have of late been enacted, and sundry
Constitutions sent abroad to be practiced.

1 First, that there was a new Bull proclaimed, for avoiding all deceit and
partiality in Electing their Popes.

2 Secondly, that those wonderful fulminations against Heretics, should not
be executed with Fire and Sword in so public a manner as was wont: insomuch,
that whereas the most expected the Bishop of Spalato should have been
condemned to the Fire, he was pardoned, reconciled, and admitted to enjoy his
honors and substance.

3 Thirdly, Cardinal Burghesius falling out with a Jesuit, called him busy
body, and told him to his face, that if ever the Church suffered Diminution
and decay of glory, it might thank the Jesuits, who had been the cause of
all the combustions of Europe.

4 Fourthly, that although the rotten branches of the Vine were to be broken,
pruned, and cut off, yea cast into the Fire, which is meant by obstinate
Heretics: yet was it no Doctrine of the mother Church to destroy innocent
souls with the refractary wicked, nor slaughter ignorant Nouices before
admonitory counsel, and advise for their conversion.

Last of all, that the Cardinals should maintain their eminent Dignity and
places, how ever men except against their originals.

From Venice.
The affairs of the Grizons ouer-clouded with so many misfortunes, draw them
from the line of Nature to the means of preseruations, and so by the
coadiutement of the Swisse their neighbors, they not only acquainted their
confederates with the miseries, that had plunged them into the gulf of
discontent, but implored the assistance of many Princes to remember the Antiqua
foedera, and not suffer them to be forsaken in this loss of their Liberty, and
troubling of their conscience: amongst whom it is said, that one Andrea Planta
was sent to the Signiory of Venice with intimation of their Estates, and
imploration of their help, who was so well entertained, that his message was
not only accepted, but many fair promises returned to their satisfaction: his
Message had these or the like passages.

The Grizons message to Venice.
HIgh and Mighty: I come not to renouate your memoryes, concerning the
combination between us, and the amitv of our Countries, nor to meddle with the
cause of Religion, which of it self were sufficient to move a pity: but to
plead the policies of State, and urge an ancient position by way of Caution:
Tum tuares agitur, paries cumproximus ardet, your Merchants cannot Traficke
into Germany, and vent the commodities of your Country, for now all is stopped,
or blockt up, so that you must with a vigilant eye foresee the danger to come
and prevent the worst: you see what is done already, neither could the Snow of
the mountains, nor the Mountains themselves, the passages of the Woods, the
cut outwayes, the steepy ascendings, the plashing of the pines, the anfractus
of the Hills, the roaring of the Waters, the danger of the pits hinder them,
but they are come thus far already: They began with the Fort Fuentes, they
continued with their Garrisons in many places, and now they have ended in a
manner with the possession of our whole Territories, so that if this inundation
be not stopped, judge your selves, whether it will flow, if it break down the
banks, and if we be not relieved in time, may it not prove a rub to gall
others, as well as our selves: therefore I leave it to your further
consideration, and so without either aggravating the cause, or exasperating the
adversary, I conclude, that there is no husbandry in letting these plants
ouerspread the ground.

To this effect was the Message of the Grizons, but their Answer was not
published, only it was whispered, that if the King of France did not send the
Duke de Rohan, as principal Commander, they would inuit Count Mansfeld to
undertake the business, and be Lieutenant General of those Forces, which should
be there employed: in the mean while they fortefied all the maritine Towns of
Histria, and Dalmatia, filled the Gulf with Gallyes, and sent two Galenzes to
lie between the point of Calabria and Candy.

From Geneua.
The great resort of Noble men and women out of Germany, the Grizons and France
in the time of these troubles and persecutions to Geneua, as a sanctuary has
filled both the Town so the Country, that a great dearth and famine followed,
insomuch that Wheat exceeded our rates, and a Bushel is worth twenty shillings
sterling, whereupon the Magistrates feared some greater mischief, as that the
Duke of Sauoy would take advantage on their distress and pestring of people,
because they heard of diverse Mustrings, and that the King of France determined
to meet him at Lions: But God has the keys of the hearts of Princes, and
opens and shuts them at his pleasure: so they heard no more of hostile
invasion, nor a word was whispered of any proiects against them, not
withstanding they stood on their guard, and besides their continual Prayers
within, had as continual Garrisons and watches without, so that withal care
and diligence they fortified their Ports, and manned their Fortifications: yea
such was the especial favor of God toward them, that all other provision
bare low prices, and for all this scarcity of Corn, their very neighbors and
adversaries, I mean the Catholic Cantons and Bazill it self, supplied their
wants, and contributed money to their relief.

From Spain.
They write from Spain, that howeuer the Soldiers in their fury have
proceeded in the Valtoline, yet have the Inhabitants bin offered fair
Conditions of Peace, and remaining in quiet possession of their estates so they
will disclaim the dependancy on any other States, and acknowledge the King of
Spain their Lord and Protector: but whereas report has sent abroad diverse
Thousands of Ducats to pay the Soldiers, and discharge some Debts of
importance and account, the truth is, the silver Fleet is not yet arrived, but
rather is so watched by the Holanders in those parts, that they cannot make
that speed as is desired, so that there is as great complaining for want of
money, as ever before, notwithstanding the King not only enlarges his Court,
but has proceeded very nobly in diverse reformations, and set down especial
ordinances for the augmentation of his own honor, and detention of the
Subject in modest rules of duty and observation, so that neither can every man
come to the Court as they were wont, nor those that come, pass to such places,
as they accustomed.

From France.
It has pleased God so to divert the King from prosecuting the war against
his Subjects, that here is every where a cheerful face of concord and amity,
and we do not hear of any man that has opposed against the message of the
Swiss and Grizons, but that the King is willing to admit of their imploration
for the defense, or if you will regayning the Valtoline, for which purpose
there has been reciprocal Embassies between the Duke of Sauoy and him, as
far as sending of Presents, and resolution to continue a peace: but they
never met in person, only the Prince of Piemont and his wife have been at
Lions, and great joy is made on all sides for the hopes men have to thrive in
their expectation, especially considering the Archbishop of Rheimes proposes
nothing, but obedience to the Church, and an Unity in Religion, disclaiming the
Jesuits, intermedling with State matters, and pestilentiall devises, to set
all in an uproar again: there has passed diverse courtesies between Duke
Hespernon, the Prince of Condy, the Duke of Guise, and others of that side: and
the Dukes Rohan and Subiss, with the Duke of Bulloigne himself: as for the
mustring of Soldiers, and great preparation of diverse Armies, there is no such
matter as yet, more then a conjecture, that if the King will undertake the
business of the Grizons, it cannot be done without sufficient forces, and
worthy Commanders.

From the Palatinate.
The waters have come down so fast this Winter, that they have removed Tilly
from Frankendale, where that worthy Sergeant Mayor Borregh has not only
defended the place, but made many sallyes to the endamaging the Enemy, and
supplying his own wants: but as I believe, neither Bauaria ^or he has a
purpose to continue there. For they neither fortify themselves, nor repair
the decayed places, or broken ramparts, but rather demolish such holds as may
be made inexpugnable, especially the Castle at Heidelberg, and the new Sconce
at Mainhem, with other places which Captain Dexter had bestowed great pains
about. The Duke of Bauarta himself is gone to his own Country to meet the
Emperor and Empress, who appointed to come thither, and give the Ambassadors
of Saxony and Brandenburg audience.

From Cullen.
The daily forraging of the Country by the Enemy on both sides, has raised
diverse hurliburlies i^ Cullen, so that the Bishop has quite abandoned the
Town, and the whole lands of Westphalia Wast, Luke, and Mank, lie exposed to
the fury of the Soldiers, who spate not to spoil both friends and foes, and
although Gonzales with Grave Vanderberghen have pretended to follow Mansfeild,
and drive him out of Freesland, for which purpose they came as far as Lingen;
yet they have smally prevailed more then common interceptions, as the troops
have taken advantage of one another weakness lying in Garrison: yet they say,
that Gonzales has surprised the Town of Rossendorpe, belonging to the Hauns
Towns: As for Mansfeild, he remains like a rock immovable, 12000.
strong, well armed, and as it should seem resolved to prosecute any action or
attempt.

From Amsterdam.
Here is great preparation of shipping both for the East and West Indies, and
as great joy for the agreement between the States and East India Company (...)
London. They feast one another, and have met i^ their Churches with public
prayers and thanksgiving: yea, the report of the business at Ormus in Persia,
is here so frequent, and well entertained, as if they had been sharers in the
glory of the English: but because they imagine the Portingals will provide for
recovery in some stronger and sufficient manner, they likewise provide by way
of prevention, extraordinary ships, provision, and Mariners for the same place
and purpose, and so determine to join with the English in those parts, if
need be: so that here is a justification published, that they neither looked
on in their dangerous fights, as Neuters, nor will hereafter give way unto any
wrong or indignity, which shall be offered them.

From Antwerpe.
The coming down of the Prince of Orange, the Duke of Brunswick, and Grave
Henry to Breda, and so to ouer-looke Bergen with all her fortifications, which
were presently to be repaired, raised a fearful hurliburly in Antwerpe, as if
the Town were already besieged, or some Treason discovered amongst the
Inhabitants, which fear of theirs was much augmented by the many Ships in a
readiness at the mouth of the Scheld, where the Prince of Orange lost some of
them, and diverse horses by an unlooked for Frost, and so the breaking of the Ice
upon a sudden: whereupon Spinola and his Captains taking some advantage
under ^^^tence of making all sure, would have put in extra^^^inary troops of
Horse, and Companies of Foot (...) the Town: but the Inhabitants answered,
They and a Castle or Citadell already, mand to command (...): what need then
any more for (...) Spin^la ^ot yet satisfied, urged the necessity of manning
their Ports in this suspicious time, and therefore only desired admittance of
four Companies to keep their Courts of Guard about the Ports with the
Burgers: b^t that was also denied, till at last upon ^etter deliberation they
admitted 4. Companies into the Town, but not to guard the Ports; who were no
sooner placed, but Spinola conferres with the Commander of the Citadell, and so
demands a lone of 120000. pound sterling in so gentle a manner, as they knew
not what to say, but that they were not able to disburse it.

FINIS.
