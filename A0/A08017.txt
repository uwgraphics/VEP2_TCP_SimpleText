Momus, and the injurious calumnies of ignominious persons, I went on with a
greater alacrity, and thought it no disparagement to bear my part with such
good Company in such a Consort. The calumnies of Momus are as the praises of
Mecaenas: Diog: Lac^ti in Antist.
Antisthenes did never more suspect himself, than when he had an ignominious
man applaud him, then, then did he use to enquire what evil he had committed.

Art than ignorance, which is ever fraught with malice and detraction. Against
these enemies only these intellectual fruits desire shelter; whilst the
Shepherd is at hand, the sheep are in safety; whilst the Chickens are vner

is careless, and the Hen leaves her Chickens, then do the Wolves and
Vultures tyrannize, and sport themselves in the ruins of those harmless
Creatures.

this Discourse; and weighed it in the balance of judgment, and found it a

THe punishment of our first Father is hereditary to his posterity, he drew
trouble and travel, cares and fears upon himself, and we groan under the
burden of them. No man now is admitted into the world, but upon this
Condition, that in the In sudore vultus victum acquires.

and enjoy the fruits thereof, but we must pass through the troublesome Seas.
Virtue is seated aloft, and the way unto it is by labor and industry.
Hesiodus.
Virtutem posuere dij sudore parandam.
It is action which gives a well-being to every living Creature: the little
Commonwealth so long flourishes, as every member in that little body strives
to bring honey to the hi^e: but when the drones begin to swarm and abound, then
it goes to ruin and decay. The Athenian Commonwealth so long prospered as the
people were in action and employment, but when they brought the delights of the
Court of Darius, and the gold of Aurum Persicum animos Atheniensium
labefactavit, and dira peste infecit.

Persia home unto them, then they began to give themselves over to wantonness,
ease, and delicacie, and to decline their former prosperity. So long as the
Assyrian Commonwealth set forth her self, so long she flourished, but when
Sardanapalus, whom Bocchas will have to be the first that induced idleness into
the world, began to invert the course of nature, to turn the days into
nights, and the nights into days, and to give himself over wholly to
delicacie, then the Commonwealth began to decay. It is industry that has
raised the most famous flourishing Commonwealths out of the dust; and idleness
which has levelled them with the dust. Of this our forefathers were sensible,
when they first instituted mechanical Trades and Occupations, and found out
the knowledge of the liberal Arts and Sciences; which had their institution to
this end, to set us in the way which our Creator had appointed us to walk in,
that is, by the way of labor and travail to get our livings, to the end
therefore that we may live according to our first institution, and banish
idleness from our habitations, which like the stupifying Otium vivi hominis
sepultura.
Sen: epist. 820.
Oppium buryes us alive in the spring and flourishing time of our age. I have
invited you here to the Country, to the City, to Divinity, and the Law. And
have first presented unto you a Countryman, showing unto you the pleasures and
profit of the Country, and the motives that induced him to take upon him that
course of life. Then a Citizen, showing you the Commodities and delights of the
City, and the motives that induced him to take upon him that course of life.
Then a Divine, showing you the vanity of the world, and the motives that
induced him to the profession of Divinity. Then a Lawyer, showing you the
excellency of the Law, and the motives which induced him thereunto.

Briefly, I have showed you a fourefold way to a happy life; Sedentaris vita
ignobilis, nam torpore^ segnitiemque corporibus, aeque ac animis conciliat.
sit no longer still then, gazing and looking about, but rise up and walk, try
and tread those paths throughout, and let not the pleasures of the Country,
nor the profit of the City, nor the vanity of the world, nor any thing hinder
thee until thou come to thy journeys end, then pawse a while, and consider
of the ways which thou have past, and that which thou most affectest, in
aftertimes apply thy self unto; in any Case sit not still. Cernis vt ignavum
corrumpant otia corpus; Ovid. lib. 1. de Pont.

Vt capiant vitium, ni moveantur, aquae.
The standing water stinkes with putrefaction,
And virtue has no virtue but in action.
Farewell. Yet stay a while, remember least thou chance to go out of the way,
that when thou come to that rockie, thornie, craggie way which thou must
pass, not to turn to thy right hand or to thy left, but to go straight
forward to a pillar which thou shall see before thee; whereon thou shall find
his inscription. Dulcia non meruit, qui non gustavit amara.
It is a pillar which Hercules set up to direct passengers the way to virtue,
and is known by his name; and it is the way which Caesar, Pompey, and all the
noble Romans went. It is the way which Littleton, Justinian, and all the
famous Iusticiaries went; and it is the way which will lead thee to the end of
thy journey, a happy life. Farewell once again, commend me to our friends and
familiars, the Disciples and followers of Cujus decus, nec viperina multoru^
ingratitudo, nec occulta malevolorum infidiae, nec apertae adversariorum
calumniae obscurare possint.
Littleton and Justinian, but more especially to the Disciples of Littleton.
Commend me, I pray you, unto them, and afford me that ordinary favor which
cannot well be denied to an enemy, thy love and good will for my labor and
pains, who have to my loss and detriment gone somewhat out of my way, to no
other end and purpose, but to put thee in thy way. Vale.

A DISCOVRSE BETVVEENE A COVNTRY-MAN And a CITIZEN: a Divine and a Lawyer.
Wherein the Commodities of the Country and the City; together with the
excellency of Divinity, and the Law are set forth.
THese four meeting accidentally together, having heretofore been Scholars
together in a Grammar-Schoole, and bred up under one Common Schoolmaster,
after some kind Salutations on each part had, it was desired that some place
might be appointed where they might renew their old acquaintance: unto which
all of them most willingly condescended, and accordingly met together, where
after repetition of many witty pranks and sleights committed during the time
whilst each of them was under the rod, they fell at last to a more serious
Discourse, each of other demanding severally, what motives might induce them to
betake themselves unto those several courses of life. The first Conference
being between the Citizen and the Countryman: the Citizen beginning as
follows.

Urban: Indeed SIR, I must acknowledge that upon the first view of you seeing
you in your Country habit, I did much undervalue you (for which I crave
pardon) fearing that some misfortunes had befallen you, and so poverty had
driven you into that mean habit, and attire, but when I understood, after
some conference had with you, what course of life you took upon you, and that
your habit did suite with your Country and condition, being much different
from our City-fashions, I then wished to my self to have had some opportunity,
having known you from your Cradle until the time that we shook hands at the
Schoole-dore, and observed that docile and sweet disposition in you more fit
for the Court and City, to know the motives that induced you to apply your
self wholly to the affairs of the Country, which at this time hating I shall
desire you to impartit freely unto me.


Rustic. I shall in this your request, give you what satisfaction I can. The
motives that induced me to take upon me this Course of life, were many, but
chiefly my health, which I prefer before all earthly treasure; for I found
that after I left the Grammar-Schoole, that the smoky fumes, and noisome vapors
of the City did much offend me, sometimes driving me into a shaking Ague,
sometimes into a Burning-Feaver, and continually distempering me, so that
during the whole time I made my abode therein, there was scant a week together
at any time that I perfectly enjoyed my self. Whereupon by the advice of the
most learned Physicians, I took my flight into the Country, being by them
persuaded that the sweet and subtle air would best accord and suite with my
Constitution: and this was one of the principal Causes that induced me to take
upon me this Course of life: other motives there were, amongst the rest this
was not the least, that I had often heard, and experience has since verified
unto me that the Beatus ille, qui procul negot^is, Vt prisca gens mortaliu^,
Paterna rura bobus exercet suis.

Countrymans life is the most innocent, harmless, and most pleasing to God of
any profession or state of life in the world. For that he does not raise
himself by the ruins of any: he oppresses no fatherless, nor wrongs no
widows: his Commerce is for the most part with the earth, and although he grow
rich, she grows not poor, or if she do, conceales and buries it in her
self. He never hears of her cries at his doors, complaints in the streets, or
Petitions in the Courts against him; all his actions are exposed to the eye of
the world, he does nothing in obscurity or secrecy, the places of his
Commerce are either the fields or the Markets; the Sun is his light, and the
Standard his measure, false lights and measures are odious and hateful unto
him: He keeps his course as constantly as the Moon: if riches fall in his
way, he stoopes and gathers them up: if not, he uses no sleights or tricks, or
bypath to come to them. Gain he counts goods when it is well gotten,
otherwise wrong and robbery. Ambitious indeed he is, but it is to do his King
and Country service; and Covetous he is, receiving more than ten for a
hundred, yea a hundred for ten; yet keeps himself out of the reach and danger
of the Law, so legal is his usury, so harmless his ambition. These were
motives likewise that induced me to take this Course of life upon me. Others
there were many, and this was not the least, for that it was the most useful
and most necessary course and condition of life of any life in the world,
without which no man can continue and subsist: for who is he that feeds us, or
who is he that cloths us? is it not the Countryman? does Corn grow in the
streets, or are sheep bred in the Markets? Are not the fields our Seminaries?
and does he not play the part of the Alchumist? are they not his labors that
produces and extracteth them? therefore although I attribute as much to the
City as any man, yet so long as a man may be as honest, as just, as good a
Christian, and a better Commonwealths man, I must ever prefer the Country.
These were motives likewise that induced me to take this course of life upon
me: yet these were not all, others there were, for that many Haud Moses, haud

Kings and Princes have taken this profession upon them, and many Priests and
Prelates have taken special notice of the good service the Countryman does in
the Commonwealth, and therefore have honored him with diverse privileges
which they have denied to other professors. The Emperors by the Imperial laws
have appointed that no Lachesse of suite, or not demanding his patrimony
after the death of his Father within the time prefixed, shall prejudice him:
also that he may lay any exception peremptory after sentence given, wherein he
has equal power with the Knight or Soldier. The Kings and Queens of England
likewise well weighing the good service that these men did in the Commo^wealth
upon all occasions, have had a special care of them; and therefore have
ordained that their See the Statute of West. 2^. Cap. 20.

Plowes and Cattle belonging unto them, shall not be taken in execution for a
distress. King Henry the seventh much tendering their good and welfare, did by
a Statute made in the fourth year of his Reign, which passes by the name of
the good Statute, specially provide, that every person of what degree or estate
soever that had any house at any time for three years then last past, or that
then was or that afterward should be letten to farm with twenty Acres or
more, lying in tillage or husbandry should maintain the said house upon the
same, for maintenance of tillage and husbandry.

King Henry the eight likewise by two several Statutes, 7. H. 8. Cap. 1.
the one made in the seventh year of his Reign, the other made in the
twenty-seventh year, 27. H. 8. Cap. 22.
reciting the Statute of King Henry the seventh, by the name of the good
Statute, does confirm what had been granted in his Fathers time, and further
graunts as in the said Statute it may appear. 5. Edw. 6. Cap. 5.
King Edward the sixth by an Act of Parliament made in the fifth year of his
Reign does do the like. Queen Elizabeth likewise in several Acts of
Parliament, made during the time of her Reign, was not forgetful of them. And
Pope Vide Statuta nobilis arti^ agricultura vrbis Roma.
Pius the fifth well weighing and considering how necessary a member the
husbandman is in the Commonwealth in the Preamble to the Charter of
Privileges which he graunts unto them, thus speaks of them, considering how
by the diligent care and pains of our dear Children, our City which in times
past was environed with the Sea, and wanted provision of Corn to relieve her
self, Nostris faelicibus temporibus in these halcyone days of ours is not
only free from wants, but is able to relieve her neighbors, and which is not
the least benefit, we have the air about our City which in times past was
foggie and unhealthful by reason of the waterish and marshie grounds which did
environ it, is by the drayning and plowing of it, become pure and healthful:
and considering again that they which do apply themselves to follow tillage
and husbandry, ought not to be drawn from their business to attend the Courts
of Justice, least thereby tillage should grow into decay. We of our special
grace do confirm unto them all privileges which have been granted unto them
by any of our predecessors, by any former Laws or Statutes; and further
grant, that whosoever shall come unto our City with any Corn or grain, that
he shall be free from the Vt facilius commodiusque omnes postint, ad vrbe^ hanc

payment of all manner of Toll whatsoever, and that all they which inhabit
within forty miles of our City, and use the laudable art of Tillage and
husbandry, shall not be disturbed and molested either in seed or harvest time,
but shall have free liberty as well to gather in their Corn as to sow it; and
that their Oxen belonging to their Plowe Tanquam commoditatis immo necessitatis

shall be free from any distress for any Civil duty or obligation, not only
at the times aforesaid, but also at all other times. And whatsoever privileges
have been granted in the best and most flourishing times, we do most
willingly grant and confirm. So careful and vigilant have the Civil and
Ecclesiastical Magistrates both Prince and Prelate been to uphold and
maintain the husbandmans profession, as the chief pillar of a State, and
welfare of a Kingdom. For they wisely foresaw that if there were not a
special eye and regard had unto it, that those houses which were used to be
receptacles of many honest Farmers and good livers, would in a short time come
to ruin and destruction; that those arable Lands belonging unto them, which
formerly had maintained whole families, would be turned into pasture. Those
Villages which consisted of many families, and that did send forth upon all
occasions the most Ex agricolis et viri fortissimi et milites strenuissimi

service, would be raced and demolished and turned into a Sheep-coate, and all
to maintain one family a Shepherd and his dog. So that by this means,
idleness the destruction of many flourishing Kingdoms and Commonweals would
have a free passage into a Kingdom, and those many men that were used formerly
to have a liuelihood out of those lands, would be sent into the high ways to
seek their fortunes; for what else can be expected when the Country is enclosed
and no admittance to be had there, but that they must roue at random and work
out a fortune though with the adventure of their lives, where they can find
it. The City will not entertain them, and if they would, they are not fit to
do them service, having ever been bred in the Country. So that I may safely
conclude, that the original and first moving causes of many of those What
inconveniences do ensue by the turning of Tillage into pasture. See in the
latter end of Tirringams Case, reported by Sr Edw: Cook, in his fourth Book,

the City are not altogether to be excused, you are Accessaries after the fact

some Charges, which they suppose are wastfully spent upon knaves in the
Country, but their accounts being cast up at the years end, they fail in
their Conclusions. I my self have known some of those saving frugall men, and

changing of a stately Country House for a few rooms in a poor Shopkeepers
Cell. A sufficient color sure to blind some dasled eyes, when there is five
times as much spent another way, in Clothes and Coaches, in sights and shows,
which might have been saved if they had lived in the Country. For there are
so many bewitching attractiues in the City, and Ladies so much given to
longing, that no sooner do they open their Casements in the morning, but they
see something in another, though perhaps Gay golden clothes and garments pounce

Urban. Sir, why do you make us Accessaries to these misdemeanors? we seldom
invite you or send unto you to come unto us. We are men of mysteries and live
by our trades and occupations; our shops are open to all Comers, and our
houses to our friends and Customers, and it were inhumanitie and discurtesie in
us, when your Ladies send unto us to lodge and lie with us, to deny them such a
Courtesy, when as we get our livings by them and such as they are. Or why do
you lay any blame upon your Ladies, as though they were any cause of your ruin
and overthrow. They poor Ladies, desire but Clothes, and those in fashion
(being all the riches that they can justly challenge as their own) and a
little meat and drink in lieu of those great portions which they brought unto
you, and when they have them they keep them as carefully as they do their
eyes, and how can they be the causes of your ruin and destruction?


Rustic. I would I could say so too, and justly excuse them, but alas I cannot,
for it is too true they are our wives that first solicit and persuade us to
come to your Cities, and so the first moving Causes of our ruin oftentimes:

Stews, the Ordinaries, the Play Houses, the Tavernes, and rather than we
shall fail the Brokers will help us to a Commodity of brown Paper to help
us forward; So that I wondered at the first how a Gentleman of our Country
confining himself within the precincts of four or five rooms for the most
part of his time, could consume an estate of a thousand pound by the year
within a dozen years or less; but when I heard what Courses he took, what
Company he frequented, I wondered then how he could continue so long. Our old
Chronicles tell us, and so do our Books of the Laws and 16. R. 2. Cap. 4.

Statutes of the Kingdom of ENGLAND, that Our Elders did not so delight in
trash,
And tempting toys, that brings a man in lash;
They loved plain robes, but hated purses bare:
Made much of men: gave Neighbors beef and bread,
Yet left their heirs rich when they were dead.
They raised no Rents to make the Tenant whyne,
Nor clapped no yoke on friendly Neighbors neck;
Nor made poor folk find fault with Cut-throte fine.
But had the hearts of people at a beck,
As we have now our servants under check.
O how plain men would follow Landlord than,
Like swarms of Bees when any wars began;
Yea glad was he that might with Master go,
Though charge and wife he lest at home behind*
In this fine world the manner is not so:
Hard handling makes men show another mind,
Then loyal love made men's affections blind:
Now can they see and will do what they list,
Cast off like Hawks, come when they please to fist.


It was anciently the honor of the English Nation to keep good His Table

Hospitality, and to be well attended; and men were so much addicted
thereunto, that diverse Laws and Statutes were made to prohibit them from
drawing such long tails after them; but they were not then so forward, but now
they are as backward: that which our forefathers bestowed upon the necessary
feeding of many bellies in the Country, we bestow upon our backs in the City;
and that which they bestowed on many blew Coats with Cognisances, we bestow on
a Coach and avant-Courrier; yet they kept their estates, we spend them, they
lived and dyed rich, we miserable. These were motives likewise that made me
leave your Cities, and betake my self to a poor Cottage in the Country. Yet
these were not all. Other reasons there were that did much prevail with me;
and this was one. For that it pleased the great In Sin^i veniunt, montisque

for it; for that is one of the chiefest reasons that I find to have been
given wherefore God went out into the Quaerentibus, quae causa sir, cur deus

remote places to deliver those sacred mysteries; because he found in your
Cities you were given to pride, to self-love, to detraction, to envy, and
inclinable to arrogate the invention of those sacred Laws unto your selves:
and therefore to give you no occasion to glory in those things wherein you had
no hand, he went out from you, he left your Cities and betook himself into
the Country. In the Mount did God deliver those holy Laws and Statutes. Thus
not only the Kings and Emperors, but even the King of Kings has honored the
Country with many extraordinary graces and favors above the Cities. These
were motives, I say, that did much prevail with me. Yet others there were, as
when I called to mind the happiness generally which the Countryman enjoyes;
how he is not much troubled with cares of building, nor terrified with Non

other for the Summer, and as many servants, one of the masculine, the other of
the feminine sex, and one horse well vnder-laid to carry him and his

that if a misfortune do befall him, his friends and acquaitance can easily set
him up again. Again when I considered how that the Countryman has more

of England. Again, when I considered that the Countryman has not so many

discontent and disquietnes, as you in the City have; for if he at any time
chance to walk abroad, he meets with few or none but poor Cottagers, poor
Carters, diggers and delvers, and in conversing with them is put in mind of
his own happiness, how much he is bound. with Moribundus Plato, naturae
gratias egit, quod homo, non brutum, quod mas non faemina, quod Gracus non
barbarus.

Plato to praise God, who has placed him in degree so far above those poor
men, who might have made him a bruit beast, or a Barbarian, or as mean as the
meanest. In one place he beholds a poor Cottage, that has no other windows
than serve to let out the smoke, no other hangings, than what the Spider
affords, no other bedsteds, or Table-bords, than the bare earth, no other
bedding than plain straw, or such as the barn affoords, no other Cowches, or
Chaires, or stools, or fourmes, or benches, or Carpets, or Cushions, than what
Nature has wrought with her own hands, the ground work being the earth, and
the green grass, the Cowselap, the Primrose, the Honisuckle, the
workenmanship, sweet and sightly enough, but quite and clean out of fashion,
and not in that request as the curious works of Art are. In another place he
beholds one digging and delving in dirt and mire, either in making of ditches
or scowring of trenches. In another place, one standing up to the knees in
stinking excrements, lading his Tumbrell to manure his Land. Here he beholds
one coming from the Market with his Candles in one hand, his Can in the
other, his Wallet on his back, and his Tarbox at his girdle: there another
coming from the Wood with fuel on his back to warm him when he comes home.
In a third place, a poor Shepherd sitting on the side of a hill, or on a
plain in a cold Winters day, shivering and shaking as if an Ague had taken
him, and dropping at the heels, as if he had been taken out of a River. All
of them being clad in Patres nostri oberraverunt cum ovillis et Caprinis

walk abroad, but you meet with objects which offend and discontent you.
Sometime you meet with an Alderman, and repine (though you be rich) that you
are not so rich as he; sometimes you meet with a Baron, and repine, though you
have an Aldermans estate, that you have not an estate of a Baron, and are never

the order of Knighthood, it may thus appear.

Gerrard Leigh writing of Olybion, who was the first and most ancient Knight,
being Knighted with Iaphets fauchion, which Tubal made before the Flood,
affirms Hospitality to be one of the nine virtues, belonging to Knighthood:
Now what Hospitality many of our Knights keeper, the nine ninepenny-Ordinaries
do sufficiently manifest.

The nine virtues belonging to Chivalry are, 1. to worship God, 2. to honor
father and mother. 3. to be merciful. 4. not to wrong the poor. 5. not to
turn thy back to thine enemy. 6. to keep thy promise. 7. to keep
Hospitality. 8. to do maidens right. 9. not to wrong the widow.

Leigh.
Knight, and then you glory that they walk the streets like Citizens, and you
like Knights. Again, when I considered how in the Country every man is valued
according to his worth and merit, and not according to his riches and estate.
If he be a good man, every one there will love him, and honor him; if he be a
dishonest man, every man will hate and despise him. They will not suffer
goodness to be trampled upon, nor knaverie to be applauded. Whereas amongst
you in the City, no man is honored ob id quod valet, sed ob id quod habet. If
he be rich, there he shall be had in authority and renown, be he never so
bad. And if he be poor, there he shall be had in contempt, be he never so
good. Again, when I considered how in the Country* men are more faithful to
their friends, more Non locat infami steriles in faenore nummos,
Et super insontem munera nulla capit

honest in their Conversations, and more loyal to their Sovereigns. It was an
observation long ago that never in a poor Plutarch in Lycurgo.
Country Cottage was there any treason hatched. Again, when I considered how
that the Countryman is better provided with things necessary for the life of
man, than you in the City; he never troubles himself to send to the Shambles
for his Beef or Mutton, nor to the Poulterer for his Poultry: he has
verveces, capreolas, et boves, beef and mutton of his own store, and wants
nothing that the season of the year can afford him: if Pigeons are in season,
he has Columbos domesticos, Pigeons at his door in his own Doue-house: if
Pullets, Capons, or Conies are in season, he has Pullastros, Capones, and
Cunicalos, in his own Warren, and of his own breeding: if Partridges, Cocks,
or Pheasants be in season, he has perdices, palumbos, and phasianos in his
own fields or Woods not far from him: if he want wool to cloth him, he has
the wool of his own sheep ad vestiendum: if he want Bacon, he has Porkes of
his own ad salliendum: if he wants horses, he has Colts of his own breeding
ad opera sua exequendum. So that he wants nothing which does conduce to the use
of man. Again, when I considered how that in the Country there are no Non

Inficit, at caelifacies, et aperta, serena,
Semina languorum discussa tulere per auras.

whom Cambyses would have Cyrus by all means to avoyde. Thus have I showed you
briefly according to my promise, the motives which induced me to betake my
self unto the Country, and judge you whether that I had not just cause so to
do.


Urban. Sir, I am fully satisfied by your relation, that the Country-life is
both a necessary, and a harmless course of life, and that there is no life to
be compared unto it, if we respect the health of our bodies only; but what say
you to the health of the soul, that may languish and pine away whilst you are
caring for your body, wanting those means which we partake of in the Cities.


Rustic. Certainly, in both respects I dare be bold to say, that the Country is
the place (if to any place pre-eminence may be given) wherein God is most
delighted, and which is most pleasing unto him, of any place in the world. Let
us examine the matter a little, to what place was it, I pray you, that our
blessed Savior in his greatest extremities always betook himself to seek
for comfort and relief, to the Cities? No; In monte pernoctavit orans, in
montetransfiguratus, in montem moriturus ascendit, on the mountain he prayed,
on the mountain transfigured, on the mountain he dyed. Where was it that the

Patriarks and Prophets of old time lived? in the Cities? No; they left the

Cities? No; in tabernaculis et Convallibus collocutorem Deum meruit, non in

Country; not among the high towering buildings of the Cities: where was it that
he entertained the Angels? it was under a Sub quercus vmbra glandiferae

did the reverend Fathers of the Church most desire to spend their days in? in
the Cities? No; difficile est in turba invenire Ihesum; it is a hard thing (as
S. Austin was used to say) in a Crowde to find the Lord. And therefore he
betook himself to the Country ad montem Pisani, to find him out. From whose
breasts did that holy Father Saint Bernard suck that abundant measure of
knowledge that did live and dwell in him? Solebat ille dicere omnes, se quas

the woods and fields by praying and meditating, and that he never had any other
tutor than the Oaks and Beeches. Where did that golden Father Saint
Chrysostom live? did he not in his youth abandon the Vitavit turbam and raro

Rome? no, but of a Mountain near unto Aritia, near ten miles distant from

he overcame Hanniball, subdued Africa, and warred a long time in Spain and
Asia, unto Rome? no, he went from thence and betook himself to a little
Village in Campania, lying between Put^olus and Capua, where he spent eleven
years, and neither came either to Rome or Capua. Where was Gueverra.
Dioclesian when the Roman Ambassadors came unto him with Letters from the
Senate to entreat him to take upon him the Empire again? he was inter

what it is to rule, and what it is to labor. I pray you suffer me to live in
peace, for I had rather live quietly by the sweat of my brows, than rule and
govern with cares and fears. Where was Lucullus, who alone of all the Roman
Captains is said to have enjoyed in peace that which he had got in time of
war, when he feasted and entertained all men of quality that came a-neare
him: was he at Rome? No; after the wars between the Romans and the
Parthians, which continued sixteen years were ended, coming unto Rome and
finding it in a combustion, by reason of the two factions of Scylla and Marius,
he left it and betook himself to a Countrey-house, which he built near unto
Neapolis; there it was where he peaceably enjoyed full twenty years that
which with a great deal of peril and danger he had gotten and obtained. To
what place did Cato Censorius (who was in his speech eloquent, in his
conversation sober, in his chastisements severe, in his rewards liberal, in
his diet sparing, in his promises constant, in execution of justice inexorable)
betake himself in the five and fiftith year of his age? he forsook Rome, and
betook himself to a little village not far from Pysa, Et ibi reliquum vitae
tempus, libris pro socijs vtendo tranquille consumebat. There, there this
inscriptio^ was found written upon his dore-porch; O faelix Cato; tu solus scis

horse is to be preferred before ten restie jades, one good hawke before ten
bangling buzzards, one true hunting dog, before ten straggling curres; so one
learned painful Pastor before ten ignorant careless ones. It is true, in our
great Parish we have but one, but such a one, as I dare compare to ten of
yours, being learned, sober, and honest, and which does add a luster to them
all, as hospitable as his means will give him leave, yet hating tippling, as

Action of his being a precept unto us, every word an Oracle, what he says at
the Table we believe, as if we heard him in the Pulpit; so faithful is he in
his words, so honest and just in his conversation, once a year he takes an
occasion to perform his filial rights unto his Father, and to absent himself
from us for the space of some few weeks, during all which time, every hour
seems a day, and every day a month to us his Parishioners, no man enjoying
himself, because they cannot enjoy him, and at his return happy is the man
that can have the honor first to entertain him. And indeed I dare say, there
is no love lost, and that our longing is not so much after him, as his is after
us: so happy are we in him for our souls health. So that we find it
verified in him, that it is not the multitude of Shepherds which make the
sheep thrive, but the diligence of the Shepherds to whom the flock are
committed, and the more sensible are we of this our happiness in this our
Pastor; by reason we see in what Sicat acetum deatibus, et fumus contrarius est

discontentments our neighboring Parishioners live in, what suits and
contentions are between their Pastor and them; how often he comes and sends for
an egg or an apple, and will rather loose the best of his Parish than loose
one of them, upon this pretense, that he has a family, and he that provides
not for it is worse than an Infidel: though indeed the provisio^ be for the
Patron, who did not give but grant, (beshrow him for it) that which he should
have give^, of which they his Parishioners are too sensible, and groan under
the burden of it, having the same measure measured unto them, as the Patron
measured unto him. Whereas we never hear of any such thing, those poor tithes
of Mynt and Cummin our Pastor looks not after, only desires an
acknowledgement of his right unto them, which we most willingly condescend
unto, and thereby he loses nothing, for whereas there is but one often due to
him, we do requite him for those small courtesies ten for one, and more we
would do if be would accept it, so does he win us by his sweet and affable
Conversation among us. Marry I know not what he would do if he had such a
family, or Patron as our neighboring Parishioners say their Pastor has. But
indeed he has no other Spouse then the Church, nor other Children then, the
poor, for whom he does as carefully provide, as if she lay in his bosom,
and were the natural begotten children of his own body. And as for our Church,
I dare compare it with your Mother Church in your Metropolis, that she is not
so beautified without, nor adorned within as our Citie-Parish-Church is; no
sooner can a storm deface any part of it, but every one runs as readily to
repair it, as to extinguish a fire: no sooner can age seize upon it, but every
one adds to a pillar to support it: no sooner can a mote come into her glassie
eyes, but every man is ready to pull it out: we defer not the time until it
be too late. When sight is gone, there is no need of an Occulist, when death
has levelled the body with the dust, no use of the Quum semel occideris, et

and vanish away. Thus do I spend an hour sometimes in musing and meditating:
sometimes again I take a walk into the meades and pastures, taking along with
me one, two, or more Companions; sometimes Vegetius Frontinus, and Aelianus, of
whom I learn how a Soldier should be qualified, and what exercises he should
use when he is not in the wars: how he should be of a good Quem metuu^t

delicacies, which will effeminate the most manlike and warlike spirits: these
things and many other I learn of them. Sometimes I take along with the
Plutarchus Chaeronaeus, Lampridius, and Philippus Comminaeus, of whom I learn
what Demetrius Phaleraeus was used to tell King Ptolomie, and what Severus and
Alphonsus had often in their mouths, that there are no such books for Princes
to look over as are Reading of History very profitable unto Princes. See Phil

wise and discreet men, whose words and works can found their praises and
noble achievements to all succeeding ages. Sometimes I take along with me
Caius Suetonius, of whom I learn in five of the Caesar's, to wit, in Julius,
Augustus, Claudius, Vespasian, and Titus, how good Princes are deified for
their virtues, and smell sweetly in the nostrils of all posterity. And in the
other seven (to wit) in Tiberius, Nero, Caligula, Galba, Otho, De Aula

to spend an hour merrily, I take along with me, either Guzman the Spaniard, or
Bocchas the Italian, or old Ieffrey Chawcer the Englishman, in whose Company I
take much delight, being full of wit and merry Conceits, without offense. And

perplexed about the division of it. Sometimes his Plow-mans tale, wherein I
see the pride, covetousness, hypocrisy, and dissimulation of the Abbots and
Priors, Monks and Friars of former ages. Sometimes his Marchants-tale, by
which I learn what inconveniences do ensue when crooked age and youth,
January and May, are linked in marriage together. Sometimes his Manciples-tale,
where I behold the punishment due to tale-tellers and newes-mo^gers, pictured
to the life in Phoebus his Crow. Sometimes his pardoners tale, wherein I see
the fruits and effects of covetousness, drunkenness, dice, swearing and riot.
And sometimes his Nuns Priests tale, by which I am taught to beware of

love and familiarity. Sometimes I take along with me merry Michael and
Luscinius, of whom I learn how one of our Countrymen entertained his son at
his return from Paris. A Countryman having one only son, sent him to
Paris, Vt imbibitis iHic litteris, gloriam sibi and omni familiae afferret.
That he might better his knowledge, and be a comfort to him and his whole
family, who after he had spent some years there, at last returned home. His
father being desirous to have him put forth himself, and to give the world
some testimony of his learning; his answer ever was, that what was read and
taught at Paris, was extra captam vulgi, out of the reach of vulgar Capacities.
But it so happened that sitting at the Table one day with his Father, seeing
but three eggs in a dish, and five persons at the Table, which he thought to
be a kind of Solaecisme, he took that occasion to show his Father some of his
art, and demanded of him, An in tota hac vicinia sit aliquis, qui apertis
argumentis docere queat, in tribus ovis quinque sontineri? Whether there were
any one in all that neighborhood, that would undertake to prove that in three
eggs there could be five contained? To whom his Father answered, it was a
thing impossible. Marry, quoth the Son, I my self will undertake to do it,
and thus I will make it to appear; Cui tria sunt ova, eidem sunt and duo, et
qui habet tria et duo, habet quinque ^ergo qui habet tria ova habet quinque.
What do you say Father? Marry son, I say he lies that says there are five
eggs in the dish. O but Father, you must answer Syllogistice, and deny some
proposition: and so I will son; Tu duobus ovis vescere quae ars tibi peperit,
ergo tribus his quae edidit gallina famem solabar. And so that Controversy was
decided. Anon after Cheese being brought to the Table, which the mouse had
tasted of, his Father being angry that he should be served with mouse-eaten
Cheese; the son to pacify him, undertook to prove out of Seneca, that the
mowse never touched it. And this was his Argument; Seneca epist. 48.
Mus est syllaba, sed syllaba caseum non rodit, ergo mus caseum non rodit. What
do you say Father? Marry (quoth he) I say he lies that says the mouse has
not touched this Cheese: the son endeavoring to prove it; the Father told
him, that the best way to prove it is to eat it, which he might well do if
the mouse had not been there before; for other Cheese he was not like to have.
And so ended that Controversy. Anon after it fell out, that all sitting mute
at the Table, the son willing to feed them with some discourse, told his
Father that he had spent some hours in the study of Physiognomie, and that if
this art failed him not, the Gentleman that sat by him had horns on his head;
the Gentleman frowning upon him would needs know what he meant by horns: to
whom he answered, that I leave to you to interpret, but that you have so, I

Gentleman moved somewhat with the argument of the young man, in some choler rose
from the Table, and posted home to his wife, and told her in plain terms that
one Mr. Seneca reports that he had horns on his head, which he could not have
but she must graft them there: Whereupon the good-woman repaires to the young
man, to enquire after Mr. Seneca, and meeting with his Father, told him how
she had been abused by his son, who calling him unto him, asked him what he
meant by horns; no harm, quoth he to the Gentlewoman, but only used it as an
Argument to try the Gentleman's patience. Well, well son, I did not send you
to Paris to learn to equivocate, or to be instructed in the fallacies, to
abuse my neighbors, and to make division between me and them, but I am well
enough served, I find now by experience, how great a fault it is to send our

sometimes, and for want of these I find every creature that I meet withal to
afford me matter of discourse. If I cast mine eyes above me, I behold the

beneath me, the birds, the beasts, the trees, the plants, all creatures
generally both sensitive and vegetative to do the like. All of them performing
those solemn rites to God and nature that was first enjoined them, no way

mind in Summer to provide for Winter; in youth to provide for age; the seasons
of the year to do the like for divinity: the Winter demonstrating death and
mortality, the Spring the Resurrection, and the harvest the day of Judgment.
So that I can truly say, I am never less alone, than when I am alone. These
and the like contemplations, for want of other books, are my recreations.
Sometimes I betake my self to the Olympia certamina fuere discus, caeus,

Olympian, Pythian, Nemaean, and Isthmaean Games; and as Vide Ovid. in Epist,

Juno, Minerva, and Venus contended for the golden Apple; so do we contend
for triumph and victory. Sometimes, the throwing of the stone is our sport and
pastime, at which It is reported of Milo, that he slew a Bull at the Olympicke
Games, with his bare hand; carried it a furlong; and eat it every bit.
Miloes brawnie arms always carries away the palm, and the glory of the day.
Sometimes, leaping is our exercise, at which he that can most handsomely rise,
and convey himself furthest, be it at the Iumpe, the Almon, or the
Beare-leape, carries away the glory of the day. Sometimes, running is our
pastime, at which he that can come first unto the goal, be it by slight and
cunning, as Hippomenes overcame Atalanta by throwing out apples of gold which
staid her.
Hippomenes outrun Atalanta, or by swift and nimble footing, as Atalanta
outrun her affectionate followers, obtaines the glory of the day. Sometimes,
wrestling is our exercise, at which that Pancratiasten Graeci esse volunt, qui
est et luctator, et pugil.
Pancratiastes, that can most handsomely cast his Antagoniste on his back, be
it with the Cornish hug, or Norfolk twitch, and trippet, obtaynes the
victory and glory of the day. Sometimes, Fencing is our delight, and exercise,
at which he that can most warily defend himself, and most skilfully offend his
enemy, be it at the single sword, or sword and dagger, single rapier, or rapier
and dagger, long staff, or two handed sword, obtaines the glory of the day.
Sometimes again, in the merry month of May, I betake my self to our
Common-greene, where I behold Tib and Tom, Iug and John, Dicke and Doll, Will

roundly, to bear his head steadily, to run a full Carrere swiftly, and to
stop on a sudden lightly; anon after, to see him make him advance, to york,
to go back, and side-long, to turn on either hand, to gallop the
gallop-galliard, to do the Capriole, the Chambetta, and dance the Curvetty. I
have thought an hour to pass in a moment, when I was young, we thought it a
kind of solaecisme, and to favor of effeminacie, for a young Gentleman in the
flourishing time of his age to creep into a Coach, and to shroud himself
there from wind and weather. Our delight was to out-braue the blustering Boreas
upon a great Horse, to arm and prepare our selves to go with Mars and Bellona
into the field, was our sport and pastime, Coaches and Caroches we left unto
them for whom they were first invented, for Ladies and Gentlewomen, and
decrepit, aged, and impotent people. The Sticklers at the Olympicke games never
look after them. When first I came unto your Cities, after I had long
discontinued them, and beheld a far off the streets barrocaded up with
Coaches, it much troubled me to think they should abound with so many aged and
impotent people, for in those Tartarian-houses I expected none other; but when
I came nearer, and looked into them, and saw youth to sit where age and
impotency were used to do, and shopkeepers and Artizans of all kinds to have
usurped the rooms of Ladies and Gentlewomen, it troubled me a great deal more;
So that oftentimes I wished in my choler, that those tottering movables were
dealt withal as Vespasian set an imposition upon urine.

Sueton: in Vespasian.
Vespasian dealt with urine, to the end to reduce them to their right course
again; and that the owners of them, injuriously usurping the rooms of Ladies,
might be deprived of Caesar's friendship, which Tacitus lib. 3. cap. 5.
Sylanus in Tacitus interpreted to be a banishment: these and the like are our
sports and pastimes. Sometimes again, I betake my self to the brooks and
rivers, and there beguile the poor harmeles fishes, presenting unto them food
and nutriment, when indeed it is lined with ruin and destruction. Sometimes

was won by Archers; every Archer having a sharp stake placed before him.

Agincourt, and other noble atchieuements, I shoot from this bush to that, from
this mark to that. Sometimes I take my bowls, and go unto our Common-greene,

upright bowl; another while I take advantage of the hilly ground with a
biasbowle: yet ever out of these recreations I learn something: by the hook

sharply reproues him for it, as if it had been a sin against the holy
Ghost* for I must confess, I have been glad to hear a Huntsman discourse by
what wiles the harmles Hare that never had any other Mistress than Nature,
escaped her bloody persecutors; how at the first, upon the first vncowpling of
the dogs, and the hearing of the horn, she forsook her form, being many
furlongs off, betook her self unto a River, and took up her seat on the
further side thereof, how from thence being driven, she betook her self to a
long stone-wall, what work she there made, how she past along the one side,
and down again the other, and at last recovered the top of it, and took up
her seat in it a full yard from the ground; from thence being driven, how then
she betook her self unto the sheep; sometimes sheltring her self in one
flock, sometimes in another; how from thence she betook her self to a hard
stony way; how she there doubled and redoubled, jumpt in and out, here and
there, again and again, and how the young whelps went gazing on, and
overshut her, whilst the old stickers, Ringwood and Rockwood found out her
sleights; how in the whole course of this her progress, she ever took
advantage of the wind and weather; in dry weather never coming near the
water, but keeping her self upon the hills, and in the woods, and in foul
weather never coming near the woods and bushie places, but keeping her self
in the moorish ground; and how at last, finding no safety or protection in any
of those places, she betook her self unto the Conies in a Coni-greene, and
there with them as one of them, took up her lodging all night. These things I
can be content to hear and see sometimes, but care not much to be a Master of
the Game; for I never held the pleasure abroad could countervaile the annoyance

Evening, about an hour before the Sun did usually mask himself, unto the
River, where finding of a Mallard, he whistled off his Faulcon, and how she
flew from him as if she would never have turned head again, yet presently
upon a shoot came in, how then by degrees, by little and little, by flying
about and about, she mounted so high, until she had lessened her self to
the view of the beholder, to the shape of a Pigeon or Partridge, and had made
the height of the Moon the place of her flight, how presently vopn the landing
of the foul, she came down like a stone and enewed it, and suddenly got up
again, and suddenly upon a second landing came down again, and missing of
it, in the down come recovered it, beyond expectation, to the admiration of
the beholder at a long flight: And to hear him tell a third time, how he went
forth early in a Winters morning, to the woody fields and pastures to fly the
Cock, where having by the little white feather in his tail discovered him in
a brake, he cast of a taste gentle, and how he never ceased in his circular
motion, until he had recovered his place, how suddenly upon the flushing of
the Cock he came down, and missing of it in the downecome, what working there
was on both sides, how the Cock mounted, as if he would have pierced the
skies; how the Hawke flew a contrary way, until he had made the wind his
friend, how then by degrees he got up, yet never offered to come in, until he
had got the advantage of the higher ground, how then he made in, what speed the
Cock made to save himself, and what hasty pursuit the Hawke made, and how
after two long miles flight killed it, yet in killing of it killed himself.

induced me to leave the City, and how we do wear out the long Summers day;
as for the tedious Winters night, we spend a great part of that before a fire;
discoursing of our Country-affayres, and the best course of husbandry to thrive
by. In which discourse the Baily of our husbandry bears a great part, for he
is usually summoned every night before we sleep to give an account how he has
bestowed himself that day. Yet sometimes we break out, and if we happen to
entertain a stranger that crossed the Seas of late: we are so bold as to
enquire of him, what occurrences have happened in those parts from whence he
came, how our Ships do at Sea, and how the Havens are fortified, and if he can
but tell us that the Ships are well rigd and mand, the Havens well fortified,

deal as freely with me as I have done with you, and to acquaint me what should
be the motives that should work that contrariety in our dispositions, to draw
your affections to the City, and mine from it.


Urban: Sir, as it is the nature of an ingenuous disposition to deal freely,
so I shall deal with you. The motives that first induced me thereunto were
these. I was a Younger brothers are differenced by Armorists in their arms, by
Martleas, which have little use of their legs by reason of the shortness of
them; and therefore by the Graecians those birds are called (...), quasi sine

this difference is given to younger brothers, to put them in mind that having

of virtue and merit.

little, but what I could work out by my labors and endeavors, so that I
presently bethought my self, though I were young, yet I might be old, and
having no more to maintain me than was left me, I must either be a burden to
my friends, or to my Country, which before I would be, I resolved to undergo
any labor, adventure upon any exploit, though with the hazard of my life, that
did not savor of baseness, or unworthiness: so that after long agitatio^

lives of many famous men, that had raised themselves out of the dust by their
valor and worth, to great honor and preferment. But when I reflected mine
eyes upon my self, and found in my self a Constitution not able to endure
storms and tempests, I began to weane my self, and to decline (though with
grief) that resolution. Then I thought to go and search out some vn-inhabited
Country of the world, where I might have elbow-roome enough, and walk freely
out of the reach of envy, and the troubles and turmoiles of the world, but
from this I was likewise dissuaded, when I considered, that man sequestered into
a wilderness, would in a short time differ little from a beast, and therefore
resolved rather to undergo any labor in a Country, where I might have the
benefit of society, than to enjoy the whole world with Timon alone, then it
came into my thoughts to shroud my self under the wings of some man of
quality. In which course likewise I was dismaide, seeing that I have often
heard, that many years Vt oculus parva festuca turbatur: ita Magnatu^ gratia,

painful labors and attendance were oftentimes requited with frowns, upon a
conceit of a thing ill done, when indeed there was no such matter. Then I fell
upon the liberal Sciences, and did consider, that although I had not spent my
time so well as I might have done, when I was a Grammarian, which time if I
might have redeemed, I would have gone as a pilgrim to the holy Land upon my
bare feet, yet I might attain to so much knowledge in some laudable Science,
that when I grew in years, I might make my self capable to procure something
to maintain me withal; but my self accusing my self, that neglecting
knowledge, the means to preferment, when I was young, I was not fit for it
when I was old, and that the Concepta semel opinio, vix deponitur.

opinion of ignorance being once settled in the multitude, would hardly be
removed. So that I did decline that resolution. Then it came into my thoughts,
to raise my self by inveigling of some tender Orphane, whose portion would
afford me some good means of liuelihood, or to beguile some young widow, by
suffering of such who had most interest in her to share with me in the
purchase; which I had often heard was the ordinary means to effect and bring
to pass such a design. But when I considered how such marriages are directly
repugnant to the law of Matrimonium factum sine Consensu parentu^, pugnat cum
lege naturae, cum lege Moysis, cum doctrina Apostoloru^, cum legibus Romany,
cu^jure Canonico, et cum judicijs patrum, vt erudite Zanch. lib. 4. de conjugio

Nature, to the law of God, to the Civil and Canon Laws, and to the
traditions of the Fathers of the primitive Church, and how in the sight of God
my offense would be so much the greater, than if I should deprive him to whose
Custody such an Orphane should be committed, of his personal possessions; for
the acting whereof I should endanger my life, by how much his flesh and blood
is more near and dear unto him than his goods and Chattles, and how I should
subject my self to be deprived of my liberty, and to be fined with a greater
fine than her estate perhaps would well satisfy, by a public Censure. And
how such marriages seldom prosper in the world, but as they are begun in
treachery and falsehood, so they are continued in strife and contention, and
end for the most part in beggary and misery. I resolved rather to spend all my
days in penury and poverty, than to raise my self by such unlawful
treachery and knavery. Then I bent my thoughts to follow some Doctor, Proctor,
Attorney, or some Apprentise of the Law: whereby I might gain so much
knowledge, as to make my self able to execute the office of an Vnder-sheriffe,
Feodary, Escheator, or some other office of note in the Commonwealth; unto
which course of life I did much incline, especially, when I cast mine eyes
about me, and beheld some in that way, Qui culmen ascenderunt, priusquam gradus
inferiores transiluerant; and from Dupondij, to be exalted above the Lytae and
prolytae. But when I considered how contemptible those kind of people have
made themselves by abusing their places, and how difficult a thing it is for a
petifactor to raise himself, without a great deal of juggling and
false-dealing, I began to be discouraged from that course of life. Then I
raised my thoughts so high as to think upon the Hunc lapidem, quidam ob
excellentiam, vocarunt Pandorum, seu universal and magnum dei donum; quia non
modo corpus humanum validum in suo vigore conservat; sed etiam metalla
imperfecta depurando, ad surunt, finem, quem natura ibi intendit, brevi
temporis spatio inducit.

Philosophers stone, and so to aspire speedily unto greatness, but after that
I had consulted with some learned, aged Fathers, who told me that they had
lived forty years twice told, and that during all that time they never knew
any to attain unto it, though many learned men had attempted it, I thought it
would be deemed a vain thing in me, being ignorant, after so many learned men
to busy my self in so endless a work; so that I quite and clean banished
that conceit out of my mind. Then I fell upon diverse projects, thinking
thereby to raise my self, one while the Tipler and Ale-seller came into my
thoughts, and how I might share with him in his winnings, was my first project;
anon after the Vintner came into my thoughts, and how I might share with him
was my second project. A while after the Coachmaker came into my thoughts, and
how I might share with him, who had enhaunsed the prices of boots and shoes
in wasting of much Leather in superfluous movables, was my third project. Then
I fell upon the Tobacco seller, and how I might share with him in his gains
(who had oftentimes caused the staple Commodities of our Nation to be exported,
and in stead of them Drugges and Indian* weeds to be brought home again) was
my last project; with these and the like fond conceits and imaginations, did I
flatter my self for a time, and made no doubt to effect what I went about, for
that I conceived most of those courses of life to be ex diametro, repugnant to
all honest trades and occupations. But when I called to mind what befell to
diverse persons, whose memory savours strong as yet in our nostrilles; how some
have been banished, and remain as a scandal upon record unto all posterity;
how others have been degraded from the order of After publication of his

and broken and every piece of his Armor beaten, bruised, and cast aside.

In ancient time, the form of degradation of a Knight was after this manner;
The Knight was led up to a stage made in a Church, for that purpose; where 30.
Priests sung such Psalms as were used at funeralles, as though the Knight had
been dead; then was he des^oyled of his Helmet, and Gauntlet, and by degrees
of all his Arms both offensive and defensive; then was he proclaimed a
Traitor, or otherwise, as the Case required; then was he tied to a rope and
thrown off the stage, with the greatest ignominy that might be; then was he
dragd to the Altar, where grovelling upon the ground, certain Psalms, full of
curses were read unto him. Innovatores, in repub: sunt odiosi.

of my self a whole year after for having once a thought in my mind to be a
projector, and so quite and clean did abandon all those foolish conceits and
imaginations. Then it came into my thoughts to launch out into the depth to see
what fish the Ocean would afford me, to apply my self unto Caesar's Court, but

shore in safety and security. At last I took into my consideration the life
of a Citizen, and resolved with a constant and settled resolution to perform
all the duties of a true and faithful apprentise for the space of seven
years, projecting to my self, during that time to attain to so much
knowledge in some laudable mystery, and gain so much acquaintance, that when
I grew into riper years I might gain something, to keep and maintain me
withal. Which resolution I constantly pursued, though I was often dissuaded by
my friends from it; they putting me in mind, that the concourse of Company,
which did abound in the City would overthrow me. But this moved me not.
Society I considered was the very marrow and comfort of life; and that it was
not Company, but indiscretion that could not make choice of Company that
overthrew them, and therefore I desired to know all, to eat and drink with
such whom I conceived to be honest, and for life and conversation without
exception: but to make such my Cum quidam in foro sapientia^ venalem

Companions only whom I found to be honest, able, and discreet, such as in
cases of difficulty were able to direct and instruct me, and when any slips
and errors were committed, were able and willing to rectify and reform me.
And thus I have showed you the principal motives that induced me to the City:
other motives there were, as when I called to mind the saying of Nero, when he
forsook his diadem and betook himself to his Fiddlers habit, Si fidibus
tantum audisset te Roma canentem,
Detestande Nero; non tanta intendia tectis,
Non caedes vidisset humo, nec funere natum
Materno insignem.

experience has verified unto me. (...).

Again when I took into my consideration the inconveniences of the
Country-life, which you so much magnify: how many miles you travel to do his
Majesty service at the grand Assizes and Sessions, and upon all other
occasions, as often as his service shall require you, to your great charge and
expense; whereas in the City, we go no further than from our houses to our
common Hall, confined within the precincts of our Cities. Again, when I called
to mind, what cares you undergo in plowing and sowing, in reaping and mowing,
in breeding and rearing, in buying and selling, before you can reap the fruits
of your labors. Whereas we go no further than the Markets within our walls,
and in an instant reap the fruits of those labors, for which you have taken
so great care and pains: again when I considered that the City is the place
where all the Nobility and Gentry of the Land receive their education, where
the Universities are seated, where the Laws of the Kingdom are read and
taught, and indeed the proper place in most parts of the Christian world,
where the Nobility and Gentry make their residence and abode. For although in
these our parts your Country is honored with the personal residence of many
of the Peers and Nobility of the Kingdom; in other parts of the Christian
world it is not so, they leave that as a forlorn Wilderness to Boores and
Peasants, whilst they in the Cities eat the fruits of their labors: it may
be some few weeks they start out for their healths sake, or for pleasure, or
in Vintage time to see their fruits seasonably gathered, and that being done,
they seldom go forth all the year after. Again when I considered how in
times of danger, we are more secure than you in the Country: if either a
foreign enemy happen to invade us, or any Civil discord arise between us,
having walls and bulwarks to defend us: whereas you lie exposed and open to
danger. Again when I considered how we outstrip you concerning the health of
the best part of us: whereas you are enforced upon the Sabbath day to go a
mile or two to hear divine service, and two or three miles to hear a Lecture;
we have divine service at our doors, and three or four Lectures within a
quarter of a mile. Again when I considered how we have diverse other Lectures,
Anatomy, Astronomy, Geometry, whereby we reap much good, which you have not.
Sometimes we hear a learned Physician read upon all the parts both
Homogenean and Heterogenean of the dead Corpse of a malefactor, one while of the
head, showing how from the Cerebrum non solum (...) vorum seeds, et motuum

brain the nerves have their essence and being, and that from thence a power
to the eye is given to see; a power to rast to the tongue; to hear to the
ear; to smell to the nostrill; and see him single out with his silver
instrument the organes themselves, by which this power is so conveyed, and
relating that when these organes are stopped or any way distempered, that the
sense unto which they have relation is out of order. Anon showing how
admirably this special piece of the body of man is hedged in and environed:
how next unto it there is Pia matter est membrana t^nuissima, proximum and

off there is the Dura matter, a covering more firm and fleshie, how yet more
remote, there is the Cranium, the scull it self. Another while we hear him
discourse of the Epar est pars organica infimi ventris, constans carne rubra,
sanguini nuper coagulato simillima, in dextro hypochondrio sita, et sanguinis
officina.

it is composed, what office it bears in the Microcosme, and from whence the
veins have their essence and being, how it is seated in the lower part of the
stomach, under the Hypochondria, on the right side of the body, that it is
nothing else but blood coagulated, of the form and figure of a semicircle, the
one side standing out like a bunch, the other side hollow: that the proper
office of it is to assimilate the Chyle, and waterish matter wrought by the
first Concoction into his own nature, and similitude; and what part thereof is
nutrimentiue, to send it away by her secret conveyances to all the rest of the
vital parts, but what is excrementitious and hurtful, to send it another way
to be cast out at the Common-sinke; another while we hear him relate where the
heart is seated, of what form it is, how it is severed from the natural parts
of the body, and from whence the arteries have their original and being; that
the proper place of the heart is near unto the middle part of the breast plate,
enclining to the left side; that it is in form like unto a Cor est pars
principalis ventris medij, dura, densa, et solida carne constans; figurae
Pyramidali, et nucipineae non dissimilis: facultatis vitalis domicilium: quo
vigente, vige^t omnia, quo languente, languescunt, intereunte, intereunt.
Nut-kernell, that it is severed from the natural parts by the Diaphragma,
which crosses the breast; and that from the lower part thereof the great
artery, by which the vital spirits are transferred to all the parts of the
body, has its original and being: at other times we hear him discourse of
the stomach, of the spleen, of the longs, of the reins and kidneyes, of the
guts, and of all the rest of the parts of the body from the head to the foot.
These things and many more are we taught out of these Lectures. Sometimes
again, we betake our selves to the Astronomy Lecture, where we learn how the
Spheres are placed in degree one above another; and how one star differs from
another in greatness and glory. Sometimes again to the Geometry Lecture,
where we are taught the useful art of Surveying; how to measure out the circle
of the Earth, to know what Compass it bears about, and what distance is
between the Center and the Circumference. Sometimes to the
Arithmeticke-Lecture, where we learn to better our knowledge in the casting up
of our reckonings and accounts, by being taught the rules of Addition, of
Subtraction, of Multiplication, Division, Reduction, and the golden-Rule.
Sometimes to the Physic and natural Philosophy-Lecture, where we learn the
natural causes of the four seasons of the year, of Summer and Winter, Spring
and Autumn, of the winds and earthquakes, of the Comets and Meteors, of
thunder and lightning, hayle and snow, and how it comes to pass that the
Inclusum loculis intactis ebibit aurum,

Of the admirable effects of lightning, see Bart. in his second days work.

Lightning should kill the child in the womb, yet never hurt the mother: how
the Springs do mount to the tops of hills, and are more cold in Summer than
Winter: how the The reason thereof is well set forth by Bartas thus:
-- The Sun and winds withal,
Sweeping the surface of the bri^e ba^l,
Extract as much still of her humors thin,
As weeping air, and waterish earth powers in.

Seas never exceed their bounds, though all the Channels of the earth do
empty themselves into them: how the Clouds composed of heavy materials, do
hang in the middle Region of the air; and why the earth is by many degrees
more cold than the water. The natural causes of these effects there we learn.
Sometimes to the Music Lecture, where I never come but admire, that out of
the greatest discords, should arise the sweetest harmony and concord, that a
Base and Treble, Tenor and Counter-tenor, high and low, should cause a
Diapason. In these, I say, which do better our best part, our knowledge and
understanding, do we outstrip and go beyond you likewise; neither do we
come short of you in the exercises in which you glory so much, the exercises of
the body, in which we take much delight, and at vacant times recreate our
selves. Sometimes ringing is our sport and pastime, to run division upon the
bells, and to make them echo out as many several Changes as the pretty --
Nunc illa gravene, nunc erisp at acutum;
Nunc summos medijs, medios nunc temperat imis
Ipsa sonos, variatque vices, nemorisque per altos

Nightingale does when she is disposed to warble forth her several notes and
tunes, we take delight. Sometimes dancing is our exercise, which in my
youthful days, after I had past my servile years, and came to be mine own
man, I did much affect, and in dancing of the French galliard, the Spanish
paven, or Scottish Iigge, I did often recreate my self. But when I grew into
riper years I began to consider, that as to youth it was an ornament, so to

age it was a blemish and a badge of lightness, and so did abandon that kind of
recreation. In vaulting likewise on the horse, being a recreation used in the
Schools, I took much delight, and have often repented my self that I did not
use it more, for that I found it always useful unto me as often as I had
occasion to take any long progress into the Country; for when others have
stuck in their stirrops and could not get into their saddles without heaving
on the one side, and holding on the other; I have on a sudden mounted into it
without the assistance or adva^tage of the ground or stirrup, and though
crooked age, which tops the tallest Cedars, have bereaved me of that strength
and ability of body, which lusty youth did afford unto me; so that I cannot
do the Pomadoes with that agilitie as formerly I could, yet still I find a
difference between my self and others that never used that delight. A Campus
Martius, Artillery, and military yards likewise we have, whither sometimes I
do resort, and one while behold the Pikemen trayling and shouldering of their
Pikes; another while the Musketeers sloping of their Muskets, and by often
observing of them, have borrowed so much of their skill and cunning, that with
a very little practice, I dare undertake to lead on an Army as well as he that
had been trained from his childhood under Mars in the field. Cockpits,
Bearegardens, Tiltyards, and Theaters likewise we have near unto us: and one
while we go unto the Cockpit, where we behold two The Cock by some Armorists,
is called the Knight of the birds, because he will rather repel danger by
fight than by flight, being always prepared for battles having his comb for
an helmet, his bill for a fauchion, and as a complete soldier, armed from head
to foot, he has his legs armed with spurs.

natural vigor and strength: another while to the Beare-garden to see a
Molossus one while to adventure upon a Lion of Nemaea, another while upon a

I behold especially the skirmishes of the watchful creatures, I cannot but
admire the innated strength which is in them, to see them when they have
received as many Caesar received twentie-three wounds; and in the receiving of
all th^se never used more words than these; Et ^^ fili; seeing Brutus to be one

wounds as Caesar did in the Senate House, then even then, when they lie
gasping for breath, by signs and tokens, by pecking and nodding, to show
signs of vnvanquished spirits, and will rather dye than cry, or yield to a
crowing and insulting enemy. Sometimes we betake our selves unto Caesar's
Court, where we behold the lusty lads of the Olympicke games, stickling for
the palm, at Tilt, Tourney, and Ioco di Canni, and practicing to hit an enemy
in the eye by running at the Ring upon steeds richly Cooparised, and as
serviceable as were the proud warlike steeds of De Bucephalo dicitur, quod

think there was more goodness and integrity to be found there in the days
of our forefathers, than there is in our days. For as for mine own part, I
could never find any such pleasure there. Shadie groves, green pastures, and

Country, says he, for woods and groves, meadows and pastures, fountains and
rivers, fowls and fishes, Corn and fruit, oxen and sheep, and generally for
all sensitive and vegetative Creatures, but the City for reasonable Creatures,
for old men and matrons, young men and maidens is to be preferred. And
Aristotle in his first book of living Creatures implicitly agrees with them,
where he darkely, but sharply condemns the solitaire Country life, the Aves

ferocissimae; quibus omnibus natura latibula, tri^eoque atque horrida^ vitam

others most devouring: the man that lives alone, he compares to these birds
and beasts: wherefore then you should prefer the solitary Country, I know
not, unless it be in this respect, that it undoes what the City has done; it
makes him to be a rude and miserable Creature, whom the City had before made
to be (...), a Quid magis sociale quam homo? profecto neque apes, neque form

Rustic. Sir, you have with Eagles eyes pryed into our Country, and searched out
the discommodities of it. I pray you now give me leave to expostulate a little
with you, and to crave an answer to two or three questions, which I shall move
unto you. First, whether the Commodities of your Cities are not equally
balanced with discommodities? Whether flatterers, whisperers,
vndermining-pioners, and fraudulent ministers, do not flourish, and prosper
there: or whether there is any ill property in any of the wild beasts of the
Country, that is not to be found in the Rogatus Diogenes qua permiciosissime
moederet bellua; ex feris inquit, obtrectator ex cicuribus adulator.

the Horse; some as greedy as the Wolf, others as deceitful as the Fox; some
as biting as the Dog; others as scurrilous as the Ape; some as wanton as the
Goat; others as unclean as the Sow? Whether there are not furious Centaures,
pernicious Chimaeraes, raging Satyrs, filthy Harpies, wicked Sirens,
detestable Ostriches, devouring Gryphins, and greedy Dragons? In more plain
terms, whether Sycophants, Cheaters, rogues, vagabonds, and the worst of men,
do not inhabit and dwell amongst you?

Sycophants we have in them as well as in the Courts and in your Country, but
every child can discover them by their base insinuation; for there cannot a
young Gentleman have a patrimony befall him, but they fawn upon him, and adore
no other god for the present; whatsoever he says, they admire, and with

more than nature, that she has denied them those gifts which she has given to
many others, to find out the many sleights and tricks which are used at play

Irish, as deep mysteries, into which their shallow wits cannot dive: Games
they say, invented at first for great personages, whose thoughts are aspiring;
as for themselves they look not after the surprisall of Kings and Queens,
little Pawnes are their play-fellowes; their thoughts are bent only upon
plain Country recreations, Novum, Passage, or the like, and they trade in no
other merchandise, than in plain bar quater-troys, cuts and fullomes. In these
little bones do they find the sweetest marrow, and in these harmeles sports
do they most delight. Others there are of the same kind, who run a greater
adventure than the former, who like their great Lord and Master, can
transform themselves into any shape, to bring to pass their mischivous
designs and purposes. Sometimes in the similitude of innocence, being clad
all in white, in the habit of a Porter, will adventure upon any Fortress, play
fast and loose upon any Lock, break open any door with as much boldness as
the lawful owner and possessor can do, take what serves their turn, make all
fast again, and at noone day when the Sun is at the highest, out-brave the
multitude with their adventures upon their backs. Others in the similitude of
a fury, all black, being clad in the habit of Vulcan, will perform the like
feats of activitie with such dexterity, that had they lived in the days of
the Spanish Picaroe, he would have been a mere novice unto them: many of
these tame beasts, which bear the shape of reasonable men, we have amongst us.
And women we have of all sorts both good and bad, whom we do value according
to their worth and merit; those which are good we do in a sort adore, for
their purity, and chastity; and study how to do them service; those which
are not, we spurn, and spit, and hiss at as they pass, and sometimes crown
them with urine; sometimes with a more base excrement, and study how to ease
our selves of them, every child can distinguish them by their Meretrices,

their names, because they would not be discovered to be what in truth they are,
Mountebanks, Hermaphrodites, anticks, bawds, strumpets, or any thing that is
repugnant to modesty and civilitie. Ordinaries likewise we have, but we
seldom come there; for we account it a disparagement for any man that has an
habitation to be seen in them, when I was young I looked into them, and if I
liked the Company, I adventured some small sum of money with them, but never
at any time could gain any thing there, yet never could know who gained by me,
for every man complained of loss; at length upon diligent search, we found out
the thief, there was a Heluo stood by us, that said nothing, yet by little and
little robbed us all: which when I found, I resolved never to come there again;
and so since I have been as good as my word. These things have I showed you in
answer to your question, that you may be assured that there is no perfect
body, but has some ill humors in it.


Rustic. Sir, you have given me good satisfaction to my first question; I pray
let me ask you a question or two more, and so I will take my leave for this
time. How comes it to pass, that the course of life you lead, being
attended with so many Commodities, is had in such contempt by the Neapolitan
Gentry, and was so much neglected by the old Romans.


Urban: I cannot give you a more satisfactory answer than by asking you the
like question; How comes it to pass, that the Neapolitan-Gentry are so poor
and needy, and the Venetian-Gentry are so rich and wealthy? The reason is
easily given; the Venetians follow and affect our course of life, and are
industrious and painful, and the Neapolitans contemn it, and are hautie and
idle. I must confess, it has been a continued custom amongst the
Neapolitans, that they will rather marry their daughters to the sons of
Gentlemen, be they never so poor and needy, than to the sole heirs of
Merchants, be they never so rich and wealthy; for they have a foolish conceit,
and an opinion amongst them, contrary to the opinion of all Learned Armorists
make no doubt, if a Gentleman of a coate-armour, marry with a woman that has
none, and has issue by her, that the issue is an absolute Gentleman, and may
give his Fathers coat: yea they hold, if a Gentlewoma^ by birth marry with a
man that has no coate-armour, and has issue a son, by the courtesy of arms
the son may bear her coate-armour during his life with a difference
Cinquefoyle.
wise men, that if a Gentleman of their Country do marry with the daughter of
a Merchant, or a Plebeian, the issue begotten between them, are but Gentlemen
of the half blood; but the Venetians are of a clean contrary opinion, and so
are the Genowayes, who hold it an addirament and increase of honor, to deal
in the way of Merchandise; to live in Venice, and not to do as the Venetians
do, they hold it as dishonorable as it was for the Lacedaemonians to derive
themselves from the loins of Hercules, and not endeavor to be like unto
Hercules: Valentinian, Agathocles, Telephantes, and Hyperbolus, they have in
perpetual remembrance: who being Petifactors themselves, or the sons of
them, became to be Emperors and Kings, and to govern the people. (*) Virtue
they account the chiefest Nobility; and suppose it never casts a better
luster, than when it shows it self in men professing the trade of
Marchandizing: to descend from the loins of noble progenitors with Catiline,
and to be a villain; or with Hermodius to pull an ancient house upon his head,
and to be the last of it; or with Salust to rely wholly upon dead men's bones,
they accounted the greatest Non tam infamis esset Catilina, nisi tam famosa

Trading to raise themselves from mean estates, and from Gentlemen of low
degree, to be potent and mighty, (as Cato did in another course of life from a
poor Cottage in Tuscanie;) that they held the chiefest glory. So that in the
flourishing state of Venice, there is not a Gentleman of note or quality, but
has a stock going in the trade of Marchandizing. It is true, I must confess,
there was a Law amongst the old Romans, which did prohibit Senators and men in
authority, to deal by way of Trade; but the reason of that was not because it
was a disparagement for a great man to Trade, but because Senators were set
apart for another end and purpose; that is, to look to the affairs of the
Commonwealth; and therefore they were not to busy themselves about private
matters. It is true likewise, it is a received opinion amongst the learned
Armorists and Heralds, Mercatura non competit viro generoso, that it is a base
and dishonorable part for any man of quality to deal by way of Marchandizing,
but you must understand it to be meant of Merchandising in poor and mean
Commodities, as in monopolizing of Mercatura si tenuis, sordida putanda est, si
magna, and copiosa, multa vndique necessaria reipub: apportans, non est
vituperanda.

Pinnes, Cards, and Glasses, or such poor Commodities, not beseeming a
Gentleman, or in exporting the bullion of the Kingdom, the iron and lead, the
hydes and skins, the Corn and grain, and in stead of them to bring home

juice of grapes, and things of the like nature, rather hurtful than profitable
to the Commonwealth: but to adventure for the gold of Ophyr, and the useful

Drake, of Frobusher, of Candish, and the noble spirits of former times. So
that without doubt Pegins was in the right, when he affirmed, that it may well
stand with the degree of Knighthood, to deal in the way of trade and
Marchandizing.


Rustic. Sir, let me crave your answer to one question more, and so I will take
my leave of you. I have often heard, that if a Gentleman by descent take upon
him the profession of a Mechanicke, his Gentilitie is quite and clean
extinguished.


Urban: You have heard in your time likewise of Goats flying in the air, of
snailes going faster than the wind, and throwing down Steeples with their
horns as they past; but did you ever hear any, that were versed in the Law of
Arms, seriously affirm it. The best Gentlemen in Venice, I am sure, and
amongst the Gen^wayes, are the best Merchants, and in most of the flourishing
Kingdoms where I have had to do. The Pertinax Augustus non aliter quam
privatus, mercaturam exercuit; idem traditur de Rodulpho Bohemia rege, and de

quos Mercatores non erant admissi.

Leand:
Nobility have thought it no disparagement to use the Trade of Marchandizing.
Gentry is not easily lost, it is a Character which nothing can deface, but
misdemeanors and abuses; indeed it is true, if during the time of our servile
years, we wastfully and riotously consume the goods of our Masters, or when
we come to be Agents for our selves, we carelessly neglect to pay our bills of
Exchange, we loose our credit and reputation, which we account our best Gentry:
the Acts and Arms, so called, because that in ancient time they were painted
upon the shields, helmets, and armours of the beaters.
Arms of our Ancestors we extol and magnify, but rely upon our own
endeavors, as upon the pillars upon which our thoughts are fixed, to raise some
trophies for the benefit of posterity.


Rustic. Alas; What Trophies can you raise for the benefit of posterity out of
mechanical trades and occupations, if you had been so happy as to have
betaken your selves to the study of the liberal Sciences, you might have had
good encouragement to have left some memorials behind you. For I have heard
from the Heralds, Nulli docto, nulli in scientijs liberalibus excellenti,
honoris insignia sunt deneganda, to men deserving in the liberal Sciences,
Ensigns of honor cannot be denied: but it is hard thing in the course which
you are in to deserve any thing worthy of memory.


Urban: No; Admit we should perform some of Hercules labors; admit with Jason
we should fetch the golden-fleece from Colchos; or bring home the
Spanish-fleete fraught with gold and silver from the Indies. Admit with Titus
Manlius we overcome an enemy to King and State in a Duel, and take his Chain
from him; and thereby purchase to our selves the title of Torquatus, and
Equites aurati were so called, because that they alone were allowed to
beautify their armor, and the coperisons of their horses with gold, and to
wear a chain of gold, which had beginning from Titus Manlius, who for that he
overcame an en^my to the State in a duel, and took his chain from him, was
called Torquatus. The form whereof is represented in the collar of SS, which
no man may wear under the degree of a Knight; by the Stat. of 24. H. 8.
Equites aurati: Admit with Frobusher made three several voyages for the
discovery of the North-west passage to the Indies: the first in the year 1576.
the second in the year 1577 the third 1578. Columbus in the days of K. Henry
the 7. discovered the West Indies for the Spaniard, having before tendered his
service to the King of England, who (unhappily) did not entertain him.
Frobusher, or with that valourous, adventrous Gentleman Captain James, we
should launch into the ycie Seas and approach the Articke pole, to discover a
Northwest passage to Iapan; or with Columbus discover some terra incognita,
full fraught with mines of gold and silver: Admit we should build Colleges,
Hospitals, Almes-houses, erect or amend the decayed walls of a City; repair
highways, or make bridges for the ease of passengers, or for the good service
we have done to our Countries, we are honored with the degree of Knights, or
Barons, or Viscounts, do you think posterity shall not reap the benefit of
these things, though we have our original from the City?


Rustic. Without doubt they shall, but if you do nothing else, but heap up
stones together, build fair houses, and compass them about with a little
earth, and so leave them, and think thereby to reap honor to your
posterity; you are much Tales qui mera Principis gratia nobilitatem acquiru^t,

milites, nor partake of the privileges of such as be honorable.


Urban: Well I am glad you do agree so far with us, that we may be Gentlemen
and truly noble, though we take upon us the profession of Merchants, or any
other mechanical trade or occupation. I pray you now being that we are fallen
into a discourse of the titles of honor, to tell me (though it savor a little
of extravagancy) whether the Ladies of your Country (if they marry with
Citizens) do not loose their titles and their places. It comes into my mind,
for that being the last night at our chief officers house, where there were
met many Ladies and Gentlewomen, there arose a great controversy between them
about it: the Ladies confidently affirming, that they did not loose it: the
Gentlewomen as confidently that they did: the Ladies giving this reason, they
did not Quando ratio est idem cum dicto, vana et faeminea esse tenetur inter

because they did not: and the Gentlewomen giving this reason, that they did
because they did: and whose reasons were the better reasons; you being a man of
judgment, and can judge between raysons and raysons, I crave your opinion.


Rustic. Truly in my opinion the reasons which the Ladies gave, were the
better reasons, because they were the better women; but yet I shall tell you
what I have heard my Father say, who had seen Paris and Padua, and knew well
what did belong to Gentry and Nobility, and had good skill likewise in the
Laws of his Country, that unless they were Ladies of the bloud-royall, or
descended from the loins of noble progenitors; or otherwise had their titles
conferred upon them by special grace from Sovereign power and authority,
though they were as deserving as those nine worthy Ladies, whom some have
parallelled for their noble acts and achievements, with the nine worthies of
the world; that is to say, Minerva governed the Lybians, and obtained many
victories: she lived in the days of Isaac the Patriarch.

Semyramis, Queen of the Assyrians conquered Aethiopiae.

Tomyris, Queen of Scythia conquered Cyrus.

Iahel delivered her Country by killing of Sisar.

Deborah governed Israel forty years in peace.

Judith delivered the besieged City of Bethulia from the Assyrians, by cutting
off Holofernes head.

Mawde the daughter of King Henry the 1. being first married to the Emperor
Henry the fifth, and so had the title of Empress, and afterward to Geffry
Plantagenet, Earl of Anjou, and so had the title of Countess of Anjou, never
desisted from the field, until she had caused Stephen of Blois to condescend
to her sons right.

degrees of their husbands, and the reason thereof is as I have heard him say,
for that it should be a monstrous thing in nature, that they whom the Laws of
God have conjoined, and made an undivided body, the Laws of man should sever
and place in degree, the foot above the head, the inferior above the superior,
the wife above the husband.


Urban: But what if she marry with a Gentleman or Esquier?


Rustic. It is all one, Abijt madam, her Ladyship is gone.


Urban: I am glad to hear your Father was of that opinion, he was a learned
man, and one that was well seen in Arms and Heraldry. The reason wherefore I
desire to be satisfied therein is, because there is a Lady, or a reputed Lady
in our City, that was the daughter of a mean man, and afterward married with
a Knight, and buried him, and since has married with a man of mean degree;
and because she was sometimes a Lady, there is not a Gentlewoman, be she the
wife of the best Gentleman in the City, but she will step before her, and take
place of her, and why forsooth, marry because the Custom of the Country does
give it her, as she says. But when I shall tell our City Dames, that the
Custom of the Country is contrary to the Laws of Arms, and the Laws of the
Kingdom; I am sure they will not accustom her to do as she has done.


Rustic. Sir, I thank you; you have given me good satisfaction to all my
questions: and now I cannot but acknowledge, that I am much taken by your
relation, with many of the delights of your City: especially with your Anatomy
Lecture, and Vaulting exercise, and if I may be beholding to you, to tell me
what days your Schools are open, I will make a journey to Town, of purpose
to see some feats of activitie upon the horse, and to hear your Anatomy

which is set apart for another purpose) and admittance you may have at all

Rustic. But do you never come thither after dinner?


Urban: Never upon a full stomach: I must confess, when I was young, I was so
keen upon some violent exercises, that no sooner was I out of my bed in a
morning, but presently I was in the Schools; and no sooner was the meat in my
belly, but I was there again; such a desire I had unto them; but I paid
dearly for it. Those violent motions begat such crudities, and such
oppilations, that to this day I could never be free from headache, of which I
never tasted until that time.


Rustic. It should seem then, that your exercises are more hurtful than
profitable to the body of man.


Urban: It is very true; if they be used at unseasonable times: the best things
may be Nil prodest quod non laedere possit idem.

abused; you know there is nothing more commodious for the life of man than
fire and water, yet if we use the one to the burning of houses, and the other
to the drowning of our neighbors, there is nothing more incommodious: there is
nothing more necessary for the maintenance of life than meat and drink, yet
if we use to eat our meat unseasonably, before we come out of our beds in a
morning, a thing too common amongst Ladies, or drink our drink unseasonably,
then when we are going to bed in the evening, a thing too common amongst Lords,
there is nothing that will breed more crudities, or bring us sooner to untimely
death. There is nothing more necessary for our souls health, than the study
of divinity: nor for the well ordering of our lives, than the study of moral
Philosophy; nor a better ornament to a man, than to be well versed in Poetry:
yet we know the greatest Constat famofot Theologos haereticos magnos fuisse, et
morales Philosophos pessimis moribus imbutos fuisse, sed haec non artium, sed
artibus male vtentium culpa est.

Poets, have had the greatest blemishes and imperfections. There is nothing
more necessary, nor conduces more to the preservation of health, than the
exercise of the body; yet if we use to ride our horses with Caligula so soon
as the meat is in our bellies, it cannot but breed in us as it did in him the
Vid: Annot. in Caligulam in Sueton^
Cardiacus, that will quickly bring us to our ends. Wherefore we seldom use any
violent exercise but in the morning, or in the evening when our stomachs are
empty, and our meat fully concocted, and therefore if you come at those
times, you shall be sure to have admittance, and find us there. And thus ended
the discourse between Rustico and Vrbano. No sooner had Vrbano thus ended his
discourse; but Rustico goes unto Theologo, and as he and Vrbano had questioned
each other, so he demands of Theologo, the motives that might induce him to
take that sacred profession of Divinity upon him; beginning as follows.


Rustic. Sir, when you were young (as I remember) you were more inclinable to
the life of a Soldier, than to take that sacred profession of Divinity upon
you; what might be the motives then I pray you that induced you unto it?


Theolog. I shall therein give you satisfaction, I must acknowledge, I was in
my youth of an active spirit, and more inclinable to any profession than to the
life of a Scholar, whose profession is to be Cloystred up in a College, and
as it were buried alive in a study, but it fell out in those my youthful
times, there was a general peace throughout all Christendom, and so no
employment for such spirits as I was of. Whereupon I resolved to spend some
years abroad in Peregrinatio ad prudentiam multu^ valet, et pene magis quam

travail, that at my return I might do my King and Country the better
service; yet before I would cross the Seas, I resolved to take a Survey of
mine own Country at home, which that I might the better do, I took some
pains in Master Cambdens Britannia, acquainting my self thereby with most of
the famous Cities, Towns, and Villages of the Kingdom, together with the
Shires, the nature of the soil, and the disposition of the people, and not
willing to content my self with a bare speculatiue knowledge, a great part of
the Summer for three or four years together, I took my journey into one part
of the Kingdom or other, to the intent that I might be the better assured, and
that mine eyes might testify those things which I had only heard and read of
before: so that after I had fully satisfied my self, by an exquisite Survey
taken of all the Shires, Cities, Towns, Villages, and Hamlets of note,
together with the dispositions of the people, and the several kind of
speeches, much differing, though but one language, I took my flight at last
over the Seas into France, where I must confess, I was a little daunted and
disanimated at my first arrival, when I saw others make themselves merry with
discourse, and I stood by like the picture of Erasmus in Roterodame, or of
Gresham in the Exchange, staring upon them, not able to answer a word; and one
while I did envy the Invidebam Neronianis illorumque temporum Chironomis et

carding, in bowling and sporting, and neglected to learn the language of my
neighbour-Country; so that I was much perplexed in my thoughts, whether I

trouble me, but at last when I had duly considered, that it was not my case
alone, but the case of most young fresh water travelers, I resolved as soon
as ever I had run over Ortellius, and his Mappes, as I had done before Master
Cambdens Britannia, and thereby acquainted my self by a speculatiue knowledge,
with all the parts of that Country, to take my flight into those parts which
were most useful for the obteyning of the Mother Tongue thereof; which
resolution I pursued, and took my voyage accordingly. Where I resided so long,
until I became so good a proficient in the knowledge of the language of that
Country, as to understand and to make my self to be understood in any manner
of discourse, that was offered unto me in the language thereof. So that after I
had taken a full Survey of that Country, and the people thereof, and borrowed
some of their language to conduct me (being indeed an excellent guide) at
length I past into Italy, taking Ortellius still with me for a companion, and
demeaning my self in those parts as I had done before in France: and after I
had spent some time there, I past further into other Christian Kingdoms, and
out of them as far as Constantinople, and after I had glutted my self with a
full view and sight of those parts, and acquainted my self with the
Occurrences that fell out during the time that I made my abode therein, and
obtained the several languages of the Countries, I returned at length home
again, being by this time near thirty years of age: and now being at home
in my mothers lap, mine own native Country, I was much perplexed in what Course
of life I should wear out the rest of my days, and after that I had long
tumbled and tossed my thoughts over and over, at length I resolved to betake my
self to the University, to become a child again; and there first to
instruct my self in the grounds and principles of Logic, Philosophy, and
Physic, but upon Physic to settle my affections, as upon her from whom I
did expect some liuelihood and preferment. Whereunto partly I was inclined by
reason of mine own weak constitution of body, and partly out of a covetous
desire I had to raise some Trophies for the benefit of posterity, but when I

Tyburne for some notorious offense. These considerations blunted the edge of my
affections, and disheartened me to make the study of Salubre consilium

Divinity. Thus have I unfolded unto you briefly the Causes wherefore I made
the study of divinity my profession.


Rustic. I must acknowledge you have grounded your resolution upon a good
foundation, and must yield unto your choice; but I pray you give me leave to
expostulate a little with you: how comes it to pass, being that you of your
profession have devoted your selves wholly unto God, that you do so much
trouble your selves with the affairs of the world as you usually do, being so
much differing from your profession?


Theol: It is a fault I must acknowledge, but we are men as you are, and
subject to the same infirmities, so long as we carry about us these bodies of
ours: we have wives and children and families, and competent provision must be
made for them, which cannot be had without some care and trouble.


Rustic. It is a thing I have often heard objected against you.


Theol: I know it is a common objection, that under color of providing for our
families, we rob the poor and the Church of God, impropriating that to a few
which belongs to many, and that we have altered the forms of the deeds of
purchase, of our predecessors; in stead of to have and to hold to us and our
successors, we have caused to be inserted, to us and to our heirs; But who are
they that do thus vpbraide us? They are those wandering Quid non absurdum hi,
quivocantur Monachi, aliqua^do declamant? ipsi nihil experti rident fora;
rident leges, non n^vigare, non equitare per illos licet, p^^o, non cacare; and
quae maxima pestis est co^iugia quoque vt rem frivolam detestantor, and humane
and generis propagationi operam dandam non ^utant.

Hu^^enus.
Empyricks, that come into our Country to see and not be seen; who if they
cannot have the Moon to bark at, will bark at their Quibusdam canibus sic

shadows: who whilst we do but that which is commended and commanded, they
do that which is condemned and prohibited, yet are ever bawling and exclaiming
against us. We have wives; It is true, and have the sacred Scripture to warrant
us; they have none, but erect Stews, and have the Scripture to condemn them;
a fault it is I must acknowledge in them that have the gift of Continency, to
ensnare themselves with the Cares of wedlock, in hope of profit or preferme^t.
But a greater fault it is for such as have it not to resolve to spend all their
days in filthiness and uncleanness. No life without question is more
pleasing and acceptable unto GOD than a Quandiu solus erat Adam nemo faelicior;
mox vt comitatus, nemo miserior, solus beatus civis patriae, co^l^atus,

single life for him that has the gift of Continency, and no offense more
damnable than to vow Chastity, and to perform nothing less, better it were
for such a one to marry with deformity it self. Continency is a deep
mystery, and every one cannot dive into it: it is a word upon which every one
cannot lay hold; which made a Reverend Charitas deus meus, accenderre;

Thus ended the discourse between Rustico and Theol: no sooner had Theol: made
an end, but Rustic: steps unto Iurid: and (as Country men when they come to
Town are full of enquiries) requested him to fill up the rest of the time they
had allotted themselves to spend together, and to acquaint him as his other two
friends had done, what might be the motives to induce him to take that
honorable profession of the Law upon him, whose answer was as follows.
Iurid: Sir, I shall therein give you all satisfaction; many indeed were the
motives that gave me encoucourgement unto it, but these chiefly. First, I have
often heard, and experience has since verified it unto me, that it is good
wisdom and discretion wheresoever a man converseth and wears out that time
that is allotted him to spend upon the earth, to know and find out as nigh as
he can the Ad invidiae tela declinanda plurimu^ valet, fi omni hominum generi,
and consuetudini, facete and jucunde quispiam se acco^n. odet; dum tamen
rationis and modestiae fines non transeat, ne cum facetus esse velit, ridiculus
appareat.

nature and disposition of the people with whom he is to converse, and to frame
all his thoughts, words, and actions unto theirs, so long as they do not
savor of baseness, superstition, or unworthiness. As for example, if it had
been my fortune to have lived at Rome, to have put on a resolution to have
lived after the manner and custom of the Romans: if in Italy, Germany, or any
other of our Christian Kingdoms, to have done the like; and if it had so
fallen out, that the Religion which I professed had not suited with the Religion
professed in these Countries, or my disposition with the nature of the people, to
have made choice of some other climate where both our Religion and dispositions
would have more nearely sympathised, for that which mooveth others, prevails
not with me, for though it were mine own native Country, which I must
acknowledge I prefer before all others; and desire (if there be any worth in
me) to communicate it unto it. Yet if my Conscience would not permit me to
observe the Laws there read and taught, and the Religion there professed, I
would seek and search out some other Corner abroad where I might enjoy that
liberty, which I could not do at home. For I have ever held it for a positive
Rule, that he deserves not to live within the confines of a Kingdom, that will
not submit himself to the Vnica gens sit; et vnic^ men's, rex vnicus, and sit
Vnica lex, vnum faedus, and vna fides.
Patrios ritus violare vbique gentium nefarium habetur.
Lips. -- Vir bonus est quis?
Qui consulta patrum qui leges juraque servat.

Laws of that Kingdom, nor to deserve the name of a Subject, that will not
submit himself to the Laws of his Sovereign. And as the Canonists have ever
held him for a schismatic person, that will not conform himself to the
Ecclesiastical orders agreed upon in solemn assemblies by the Reverend
Fathers and Doctors of the Church, but out of a self-conceit, will seem to be
more wise than the general Counsels and Assemblies. So have I ever thought
him to deserve the name of an Outlaw, and to be exempt from the benefit of the
Law, that will not submit himself unto the Laws. Now because it is a hard
thing, yea indeed impossible almost for a man to observe those Laws which he
knows not; therefore did I desire to know the Non invtile consilium
serenissi^^ nuper regis ad Henricum nuper principem. Operam da patrijs legibus;
nam quomodo juxta illas dices sententiam, si tibi fuerint ignotae.

Proprium est sapientiae nosse leges secu^dum quas vivimus.

Keck: lib. 2. Ethic.
Laws of the Kingdom wherein I lived, and thereby as a rule to frame and
fashion all my actions by. And because every good thing the more common it is,
a greater measure of virtue it contains in it: therefore was this one
principal motive wherefore I made the study thereof my profession; unto which
I was the rather induced, because that I had often heard, and upon inquiry I
have found it to be true, that all Laws political are mere derivatives out
of the primitive Law of God and Nature.


Rustic. Sir, if you could but make that appear unto me, I should commend your
choice, and prefer your profession before all other professions, the sacred
profession of divinity only excepted.


Iurid. To give you satisfaction in this point, I will first show unto you what
the Law of Nature is; then what the Law of God is: and lastly, how all Laws
are derived out of both those Laws, and so conclude my Discourse. The Law of
Nature, or rather the unwritten Law of God, is a divine knowledge, to wit,
reason and understanding planted in the soul of man, whereby he has Ratio
perfecta proprium hominis bonum est: caetera illi cum animalibus satisque
communia sunt Valet? et leoues: formosus est? and pavones: velox est? and equi:
corpus habet? and arbores. Habet impetum et motum voluntarium? and vermes, and

dominion over the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, and fishes of
the Sea. For had those Hydra's, Lions and Bulls, in spilling of whose blood
Hercules got so much honor, been endowed and made partaker of this Law,
Hercules could not have gloried and triumphed in those his Victories and
Conquests over them. The Law of nature to procreate and engender, they had in
as ample manner dwelling and abiding in them, but because they wanted this
supereminent faculty of the soul, they were as Sampson without his hair, and
had no power to resist him. It is by the understanding alone, that we have
dominion not only over those Bulls, Bears and Tigers, that are without us, but
over our domesticke enemies, those Tigers, Wolves, and Affectus nostrisunt
quidam Cacodaemones, and appellantur amentes Consiliarij. Plato in convivio

Cacodaemones, our unruly lusts and affections that are within us. It is this
that allayes the hot, fiery, choleric humor, distilling into it most
sovereign cool receipts of patience and forbearance; it is this that
exhilarates our dull and drowsy spirits, infusing into them her quickening
precious Cordials and restoratives; that in the midst of miseries gives us
cause of joy and merriment, and in the midst of joy puts us in mind of our
miseries, so as in the former we be not so much grieved as to neglect our
selves, and so grow into despair; or in the latter so much joyed as to forget
our selves, and so grow proud; it is this that moderates those greedy desires
of rapacity and tenacitie, teaching us with what we have to be contented, not
to loose the benefit of what we Vide apologum de Phil^mela and accipilrei quo
significatur eos esse inconsultos, qui ^pe majorum quae incerta sunt, quae in

little pleasure, which vanishes even in the throat: not to repine at his
costly garments, but rather to smile at them, to see him as much as in him
lies, to invert the seasons of the year, to wear such thin, cut and carved
suits in the midst of Winter, more fit for the heat of Summer, and to let thee
know, that though thine be not so rich, yet they are as warm, and lined it may
be with far more contentment; and that those which he wears artificially,
the beasts wore before naturally; not to murmur at his large Territories, but
to consider that as he has more Corn and fruit, so he has more Semper habet

paid dearly for them, and still groans under the burden of them; for many
are the cares that accompany greatness: the tall Cedar is subject to storms

honestly toward all men, to give unto Superiors honor and reverence, to
Inferiors due respect, to equals mutual love and society; not to deifie the

but to esteem of poverty clad with honesty above Omne tempus feret Clodius,

to deal with all men as we would be dealt withal, to take no advantage of

Quintus Fabius, and Caius Marius sometimes did. If a famine has overspread

instant climb up into heaven and behold Orion and the Pleiades, Aquilo and
Boreas, Phosphorus, and Vesper, much distant one from another. That can on a
sudden descend into the Center of the earth, and in an instant walk the
Circumference, pass through the four parts of the world, discover the
quality and the condition of the people together, with their several Laws,
Customs, and manner of Government; tell us by what means the great and
flourishing Nations of the world have attained unto so much growth and stature,
and by what means again they have come to ruin and destruction; how this man
achieved unto so much honor, how that to so much detestation and hatred. How
Rome became so rich, How Carthage so poor: how Caesar so great; how Pompey so
mean: by the example of the one to follow and pursue, by the example of the
other to fly and avoyde.


Rustic. How comes it to pass, that nature having so excellent a servant,
that she cannot have her rights and Ceremonies more duly performed unto her;
that the body in stead of soundnes in every part, should produce nothing else
but Apoplexies, Gowts, Dropsies, racking diseases of the stone, and infinite
other infirmities: and that the mind in stead of firm and settled resolutions,
should yield nothing else but wavering and wandering conceits and imaginations.

Hercules in the prime of his youth intending some noble achievements, and
thereby to raise an Stat sua cuique dies, breve and irreparabile tempus

manner following. Sir, it does not become a man of your quality to undergo
adventures, to be ever climing the steepie craggie Mountains, and never come
to the top of them, to be by Boreas tossed to and fro both by Sea and Land in
continual danger of death, adve^tures fit for such as have nothing else but
their lives to loose, but as for you that have a paradise bequeathed unto you
upon earth, to be rolling Sisyphus-stone, to be climing up the steepie
mountains, when you may walk in the green pastures, to expose your self to
the heat of Summer, and cold of Winter, when you may be walking in your shady
groves, or in your warm house, to be an Atropos to your self, to pull ruin
and destruction upon your own head, when you may sleep securely, shot-free,
environed with the love of your friends; it is a wilful vanity in my opinion:
which the chaste woman hearing, thus replies; Nulla fides veneri, levi^ est,
interque planetas
Ponitur, haud inter sydera fixa venus.

Beware of her, and of her Counsels, I have known her long and many of her
friends and favorites, but never knew any but ruin and destruction was the
end of them; they were not like other people, but monsters in nature, Qui sunt

troubled with idle, vain, and childish imaginations in the declining time of

they were sober, learned, and wise, and the world has taken special notice of
them for all these, and for you to make your self a bastard, that was so
truly borne, the Fabula vos estis juvenumque senumque tabernis

industry, these are the keys that open the gate to fame and renown, and the
only coin that passes current there. If Caesar had slept and been ruled by
her precepts, his name had been extinguished with his Carcass long before this
time. And the Romans would have had no cause to have trivmphed in this their
valiant Champion for his noble atchieveme^ts against Pompey in the Pharsalian
fields. If Alexander had done the like, the world would have had more Monarkes
than one, and the Macedonians had no cause to glory in him, it was his industry
that raised him, his security that overthrew him. Experience teaches us, that
if we do expect any thing from our friends, that it is fit that we do
endeare them unto us by some noble Est commune proverbium Anglicanum. First
deserve, then desire.

understanding unto the Chaste woman: unto whose Commands so long as the senses
are obsequious, so long God and nature have their rites and ceremonies duly
performed, but when they are directed and guided by the will and appetite, then
they are excluded and debarred of the things which belong unto them: wherefore
may the will and appetite fitly be compared to a L^nam non potuit, potuit

Rustic: But how comes it to pass, that the will and appetite should so much
covet and thirst after those things which tend to ruin and destruction.


Iurid: Sir, your question has been much Controverted amongst the ancient
Academicks of natures School, and the Doctors have been much distracted about
it; some have been so presumptuous as to lay the fault upon Jupiter himself,
and to say that he has two Tubs, the one a Cabinet for virtues, the other a
cage for uncleanness, and that when it seems good unto him, he does distribute
unto one, justice, wisdom, temperance, and fortitude, and to another folly,
pusillanimitie and intemperance; but the most wise and discreet among them,
have acccused and condemned this as a fault of high presumption, and have
affirmed, that as well might they maintain that the Lions might produce
Elephants, Elephants Bears and Wolves; the earth that which is proper to the
heavens, and the heavens that which is proper to the earth, as that the
fountain and source of goodness should produce any thing, but that which is
good. Others have imputed it to the Constellatio^s and Planets under which they
were borne, but this has been rejected likewise as a paradoxe: for as well
might they maintain that order might produce confusion, as the Sun, Moon,
and Stars, that keep their constant courses any such effect: others to their
natural temper and inclination, but this the whole body of nature has
condemned as erroneous, for as it is in the great sublunary world, consisting
of reasonable, sensitive, and vegetative Creatures, the inferior readily submit
themselves to the superior, the vegetative to the sensitive, the sensitive to
the rational, and all to maintain and uphold that great body; So it is in
the Epitome or Dicitur h^mo (...), quia est un versi orbis Epitome, seu
abbreviata mundi tabella; nam continet in se quatuor elementa et omnes mundi

mouth readily performs her office, becomes the gate to let in food and
sustenance, the palate the instrument to try and touch it, the stomach to
chilifie it, the mesuraicke veins to waft it to the Liver, the Liver to die it
into sanguine, and through the great and maine Ocean, the Vena Cava to convey
the virtue thereof to the rest of the parts of the body: so ready is every
part and member of this little world to do their rites and services to each
other. So that in the natural inclination it cannot be, for that Scaliger

anecre^t, it will pull in her boughs, and as soon as he goes away, it will
put them forth again; and therefore is called the shamefast tree. And Arist.

of that natural ingrafted desire in all things to preserve their being.
nature does ever incline to that which tends to the preservation of it, and
the will to destruction, others to nurture and education, but this likewise
has been rejected; for although these great Doctors did attribute much to

seed; that we gather not grapes of thorns or figs of thistles; yet because
there was not the best Aristotelian, Platonist, or best proficient in natures
School, that could perform and pay unto her what of right did belong unto
her, therefore it could not be for want of nurture and education. Thus did the
Philosophers long weary themselves in searching after this mystery, until at
last they found it out, they found that Adam by his fall lost both form and
fashion:
His rosy cheeks are changed to earthen hew,
His tear drowned eyes, a night of Clouds bedyms,
His faynting knees with feebleness are humble,
His dying body drops an icie dew:
About his ears a buzzing horror swims:
His faultring feet do slide away and stumble.

nature was corrupted, that the light of knowledge which shined in them more

nothing more than what is prohibited; how the tongue whose usual tune and tone
was to warble out praises and prayers, spues and vomits out nothing but oaths,
execrations, and blasphemies, how the hands the instruments of charity, are
become the instruments of extortion and oppression, how the very vital parts
are corrupted, how the heart the receptacle of honesty and integrity, is
become a cage of uncleanness: how the Liver that was used to send forth nothing
but pure, clear, and sanguine blood, distills nothing but waterish,
choleric, and melancholicke blood: how the spirits sometimes agile, nimble
and quick, are become dead, and dull, and void of life: how every part of man
is altered and changed from that which sometimes it was: how after the example
of their great Lord and Master, the inanimate Creatures have revolted, how the
air forsakes her proper station, and unnaturally descends into the Cranies of
the earth, and causes a general ague in the whole body of the sublunarie
world; how the fire breaks out in rebellion, wastes and consumes the very
dwelling of her great Lord and Master; how the -The sullen en^i^^^ earth
From blackest cells of her ^oule breast, sends forth
A thousand foggie fumes, which every where,

earth instead of fruit brings forth thorns and thistles, and a thousand
filthy foggie fumes and vapors; how the four Rivers Ganges, Tygris,
Euphrates, and Nilus, instead of watering and refreshing the garden of their
Master, drown and overwhelme it; how all things generally have lost much of
their worth and goodness, which sometimes they had. So that the Heathens by
the glimmering light of nature which remained in them, did point in a manner at
the fall of man. So much satisfaction do they that had no other Academie than
natures School give unto you, but he that is the meanest Disciple in the
School of Christ, that had not only nature for his guide which they had, but
grace which they wanted, can fully resolve you: that in the beginning it
pleased the Creator of heaven and earth to stamp in man his own image and
picture, to give unto him which was denied to all other Creatures, a divine,
pure, and immortal essence, a soul endowed with many rare and admirable
faculties; heaven and earth to hold at will, together with a free use of all
the Creatures, both of the fowls of the air, and fishes of the sea, and of
all the Creatures that walk upon the face of the earth, both sensitive and
vegetative, only amongst the vegetative reserving unto himself a little Tree,
enjoining him upon a strict penalty, that he should not dare to adventure upon
it, being a fruit provided for his own palate; but he not contented with those
things, which were so freely granted him, coveted after those things which were
excepted; wherefore God in justice for his disobedience entered upon the whole,
yet dealt not with him as he had deserved, but out of his abundant goodness and
favor unto him regrants the same, but upon other terms and conditions than
before; for whereas before the earth of her self yielded her increase without
any plowing or sowing; whereas before he had an Antequam peccasset Adam, a^ma

Bartas. Knowledge was then the souls soul sorligh,

understanding more clear than the morning star, whereby he was able to
discern in himself the sum and scope of all those sacred Books which have
been since written of the knowledge of Arts and Sciences, of the heaven and of
the earth, of natural and moral Philosophy by the holy Prophets, Apostles,
and Evangelists, by the reverend Fathers and Doctors of the Church, and by the
learned Sages and Moralists of the world; whereas his will before was guided by
his understanding, and the appetite and the rest of the affections never
exceeded the rules of reason, the case is now altered, the earth will no more
yield her increase of her self; he must not now eat before he has sweat for
it, labor and pains must now be his rent, or else he cannot enjoy the
enheritance; the understanding which was sometimes like Argus, Eagle-ey'd and
clear sighted, is now become like Polyphemus, dark and obscure; the will and
the Our affections are aptly compared to the sword which Hector gave Ajax;
which so long as h^ used against his enemies, served for his defense, but when
he began to abuse it to the hurt of harmless creatures, then it turned into
his own bowels.
affections, which sometimes were as obedient as a servant, are now become as
disobedient as a rebel: all things are now out of order: and all by reason of
the fall and transgression of our first Parents. So you may see the reason
plainly wherefore the will and appetite do so much desire that which tends to
ruin and destruction.


Rustic: Sir, it should seem then that man by his fall is in worse case than
the bruit Creatures, the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field; for
they naturally desire nothing which tends to their ruin and destruction.


Iurid: It is true. If God out of his abundant grace and favor toward him had
not had compassion of him, he had been in worse case indeed, for that he had
subjected himself by his fall to an eternal death and punishment, from which
the bruit Creatures are exempt; but it pleased the Almighty to send his only
begotten Son to help him up again, and to Epitomize the first unwritten
Laws that were in his Quis scribit in cordibus hominum naturalem legem nisi
deus? De qua Apostolus ait; cum enim genies quae legem non habent, naturaliter,
qua legis sunt, faciunt; hi legem non habentes sibi sunt lex, qui ostendunt

Creation planted in his soul, which he by his fall had slubbered and defaced,
and to deliver them unto him by his servant Moses, to the intent that he might
lay hold of them, and reprint them in his soul again, and so be raised and
remitted to his former inheritance.


Rustic: What were those Laws which were delivered unto Moses?


Iurid: You may partly know what they are, by telling you what they are not;
they are not those Canonical Books of Law which were sent from Nihil al^ud in

Rustic: Were the Laws that were first infused into the soul of man so much
defaced, that he should need a remembrancer to put him in mind of his
Creator? or was any man ever so sottish and stupide as not to believe and
acknowledge the true and ever-living GOD to be his God and Creator.

Creatures in the sublunarie world, which Antonius Eremita called his Books,
readily know and acknowledge that it could not be, but there must be some
predominant power that did guide and govern them. All the Sibylls did
acknowledge one absolute God; the Turks do the like; and Pythagoras in
derision and defiance of Idoll-Gods, was used to say, that if there be any one
that dare presume to say, that he is God besides one, let him build such
another world and I will believe him. Nay the Sibylls waded so far, that they
believed the resurrection, and could say, that if in a Si in ave rationis

Thou shall not bow down thy self to them, nor worship them: For I the Lord
thy God am a jealous God, visiting the sins of the Fathers upon the children,
unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me:

And show mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my Commandments.

When the Lord saw man upon all occasions, as his unruly passions and
affections led him, to take his holy Name in vain: sometimes bathing his
polluted hands in his most precious blood; sometimes rubbing of his exulcerate
wounds, and more often calling upon him to damn him than to save him, was
pleased to express himself thus. 3. Thou shall not take the name of the Lord
thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that takes his
Name in vain.

When he saw him profaning of his Sabbath, making no difference of days, when
either pleasure or profit, or preferment was before him, was pleased to put him
in mind; saying, 4. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.

Six days shall thou labor and do all thy work.

But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shall do
no manner of work, thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor
thy maid, thy cattle, nor the stranger that is within thy gates.

For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein
is, and rested the seventh day, wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and
hallowed it.

When he saw him carelessly neglecting them that brought him into the world,
that had undergone many pangs, and sighs, and groans for him, that had
nurtured and educated him, that had labored and toyled all the days of their
life, undergone the heat of the day, and cool of the night, risen early and
gone to bed late, and all to gain an inheritance for him, he was pleased to
put him in mind; saying, 5. Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days
may be long in the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee.

When he saw him likewise valuing the blood of man* no more than of a beast
provided for the slaughter, upon all occasions, without any Commission from him
taking the sword into his own hands, and revenging a word fallen in heat, and
oftentimes drawn out of the speaker with death, yea sudden death, was
pleased to put him in mind; saying, 6. Thou shall do no murder.

When he saw him likewise wandering after beauty, sacrificing to his lusts as
to his God, voluntarily divorcing himself from his legitimate spouse, and
bedfellow, and all to please his sensual appetite, was pleased to put him in
mind; saying, 7. Thou shall not commit adultery.

When he saw him sometimes with a strong hand openly invading the possessions
of his neighbor, sometimes by fraud secretly undermining them, and sometimes
surreptitiously and feloniously entering into them, was pleased to put him in
mind, saying, 8. Thou shall not steal.

When he saw him likewise so presu^ptuously profane, as to dare to call him to
witness that which his conscience before told him, was most false and unjust,
was pleased to put him in mind; saying, 9. Thou shall not bear false witness
against thy neighbor.

When he saw him likewise lo^ging after his neighbors house, neighing after
his neighbors wife, and taking more pleasure to compass that which was his,
than he did to enjoy that which was his own; was pleased to put him in mind;
saying, 10. Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house, thou shall not covet thy
neighbors wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor
his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbors.




Rustic: Are these the Laws out of which all humane Laws are derived?


Iurid: Yes certainly.


Rustic: How does it appear?


Iurid: By the testimony of the most ablest men in their generations.


Rustic: What do they say of them?


Iurid* Positively, that they are the fountain of all humane Laws, and show
Herbach. Primum praeceptum su^mam earum legum quae ad Monarchiam spectat,

precisely how, they say, that out of the Laws of the first Table are derived
all those Laws which do concern our duties toward God; and out of the Laws
of the second Table are derived those which concern our neighbor. Again,
more punctually they say, that out of the first precept of the second Table,
being the fifth in order of the decalogue, all those Laws which do concern
that part of Justice, which the Iusticiaries have named Distributive Justice;
and out of the fourth precept of the second Table, being the eight in order of
the Decalogue, all those Laws which do concern that part of Justice, which
the Iusticiaries have named Commutative Justice, are derived: and out of the
fifth Law of the second Table the Laws of Actions. Yet more punctually, those
Laws which do concern the persons of men are borrowed from the first of the
second Table: and those which concern their estates are borrowed out of the
fourth of the second Table; and those which decide Controversies, are borrowed
out of the fifth of the second Table. Under which titles, persons, estates, and
actions, all Laws are comprehended. Again, yet more punctually they show what
Laws are derived out of every precept, unto which, as the Springs to the
Fountain, all humane Laws have relation one way or other.


R^stic: You do not number the Laws of the Heathens amongst these Laws,
which you will have to be derived out of these sacred Laws.


Iurid: Yes certainly.


Rustic: I pray you, how could they that never knew God, know his Laws?


Iurid: Though they had no perfect knowledge, yet they had a glimmering notion
of them by tradition from the Patriarks, and by some relics which they left
behind them; though Herbach.
(...), by a false worship they abused and corrupted them, giving the honor
due unto the true God, unto their false and imaginary Idols; it was in
imitation of those sacred Laws, that the old Romans made the Laws of the Ten
Tables, and set up their Decemviri, Ten men to see those Laws duly executed,
unto which Numa added two, and so they passed by the Laws of the twelve
Tables. It was from those Laws likewise that Lycurgus framed his Laws, unto
which the Lacedaemonians took such liking and affection, that they resolved so
long as he continued absent from them, to keep them inviolably; who to the
intent his Laws might not be violated, willingly banished himself from his
own Country, and dyed in Delos, by which means his Laws, according to the
Oracle of Apollo continued in force by the space of 500. years. Out of these
likewise Solon framed his, which among the Athenians were of like repute and
estimation, though Anacharsis was pleased to compare them unto Spiders webbes:
and out of these Minos framed his, though the Athenians and Citizens of Megaera
for that he sought revenge for the cruel murder of his son, were pleased to
term him the chief Judge of hell: and from these Numa borrowed his, though he
gave the honor thereof to the Idol goddess Aegaeria.


Rustic: How can you say that Lycurgus and the rest of the Heathens had an eye
unto those sacred Laws in the making of theirs, when as many of their Laws
are ex diametro repugnant unto them? Plutarchus in Lycurg^.
Lycurgus made a Law, that if a child were not strong, well proportioned, and
like to do his Country service, he should be thrown into the Apothetes, the
common-house of office: and Aristotle has the like Law, Nihil Arist. lib 7.
cap. 16. polit.
debilitatum educandum esto, which Laws of theirs, not only the Laws of GOD
and nature, but even the Heathens themselves condemn as barbarous. Ingenio
pollet cui vim naturae negavit.
Says the Poet, the weakest bodies have the strongest wits: and Seneca has
many sayings to this purpose, Ex casa vir magnus exire potest, and ex deformi
humilique corpusculo formosus animus and magnus, out of a poor Cottage
oftentimes proceeds greatness, and out of a deformed and misshapen body a
good and honest heart. Who more deformed then Richard the third, King of
England, yet who more Courageous, and had not his unjust usurpation of the
Crown, and the monstrous unnatural murders of his two Nephews, eclypsed all
the worth that was in him, he might well have had a place in Paulus Iovius
among the magnanimous spirits of the world? Who more Ingenium aliquando male
habitat vt M. Lo^^i^^ soleret jocari in Galbam qui fuit egregi^ eruditus,

Aesopus fuit omnium suae aetatis hominu^ deformosissimus, acuto capite pressis

ide^ enim Aesopus, quod Aethiops, ventrosus, valgus et jucurvus, and Homericum
Thersitem turpitudine formae superans.

Vide vitam Aesopia Planude conscripta^.
crooked then Aesop, yet who more witty than Aesop? Who more deformed than the
William Malmesburie de gesti^ regum Anglia, lib. 2.
Bishop of Collen, of whom William of Malmesbury makes mention, yet who more
holy than he? There was (says William of Malmesburie) in this City, which
heretofore was called Agrippina from Agrippa, but afterward of Trajan the
Emperor Colonia, a poor parish Church, into which there came an Emperor of
Germany one Sunday morning from hunting in the habit of a Soldier, and when
he saw a Priest deformis sane and plane portentum naturae, deformed and crooked
saying of divine service, he wondered with himself; Quare deus a quo cuncta
formosa procedunt tam deformem hominem sacramenta sua perficere permitteret,
wherefore God from whom all beauty proceeds, would suffer so deformed a
creature to serve him in so high a place. But as he was thus excogitating with
himself, it happened, that the Priest read those words which were in the
Psalms appointed for that day; Know you not that the Lord is God, and it is he
which has made us and not we our selves: which words when the Emperor heard,
he took them as Oracles sent from God to give him satisfaction. Wherefore
having fully informed himself of the condition of the man, and finding him to
be both a learned and good man, made him afterward Bishop of Collen. How can
these Laws be derived, I say, out of those sacred Laws when as they do
directly impugn them. Again, Plutarch in Lycurgo.
Lycurgus made a Law, that if a man disabled by nature to procreate, being an
impotent man, should for covetousness sake marry with an inheritrix, she might
make choice of any of her husbands kindred to beget Children of her: which Law
of his is directly repugnant to the Law of God. Again, Plato made a Law, that
young men and women should at certain times of the year, in certain places
appointed for that purpose, which he calls Gymnasia, for the exercise of
their bodies, increase of their strength, and to make women more hardy to bring
forth their children, dance, run and ride naked in the presence both of young
and old people. Again, Eadem lex apud Aegyptios.

Furta apud veteres Aegyptios omnia fuisse licita, and impunita, apud
Lacedamonios laudata refert. Gell. lib. 11. ca. 18.


Lycurgus made a Law, that it should be lawful for boys to steal and prole
petty things, so that they did it handsomely, upon pretense to enable them to
be more fit for pillage when they came to be Soldiers, and make them more
quick of spirit, and others more careful to keep that which they have; how
can these Laws by any means be said to be derived out of the Laws of God,
seeing that they do directly impugn them.


Iurid: Certainly, these were not the Laws but the errors and extravagant
opinions of these men; Nam lex est sanctio jubens honesta, and prohibens
contraria, Laws do command things that are honest to be done, and prohibit
the contrary. Lycurgus, Plato and Aristotle were men, and had their -- Vitijs
nemo sine nascitur
Optimus ille qui ^^^nis vrgetur.
Horas.
errors, though they were the oracles of their times; and the wonders of the
world, and it is no wonder; for the reverend Fathers of the Church had theirs;
Saint Augustine writ two books of Retractions; and of Saint Origin it is said,
Vbi been nemo melius, vbi male nemo pejus, where he did well no man did better,
but where he did ill no man did worse.


Rustic: What are the Laws then that are derived out of those sacred Laws?


Iurid: Generally such as have a correspondency with the Law of God, that do
as they do command things honest to be done, and prohibit the contrary; such
indeed as were the Laws of King Allured, who made the Law of God his Vide
praefatione^ ad leges Allured in priscis Anglorum legibus.
Masterpiece in making of his Laws to govern his people, and set it in the
frontispice of them.


Rustic: I pray you acquaint me more particularly, what are the Canonical and
other Laws now in force that are derived out of those sacred Laws?


Iurid: Sir, if I should give you a particular account of all the Laws that
are derived thence, a mighty volume would not contain them. Wherefore I will
only show unto you the titles and heads of those Laws which are derived out
of every Law. And first I will show you what Laws are derived out of the Laws
of the first Table; and so of the rest as they fall in my way. The Laws which
are derived out of the Laws of the first Table are those, viz. De summa
Trinitate, de fide catholica, de sacrosanctis ecclesijs, de haereticis de
Apostatis, de blasphemijs, de juramentis et similia, which punish as well those
that attribute the honor due to the true God to false and imaginary Idols; as
they which live without God in the World.


Rustic. What kind of persons, I pray you, are they that do so?


Iurid: In the first place is the Atheist that monster of nature, whom the
heathen Orator long ago condemned, affirming, that no Omnibus innatu^ est, and
quasi insculptum, esse deum.

Cicero lib 2 de ^at. deorum. Nulla gens est, neque tam i^ma^suet^, neque tam
ferrea quae deum non agnosc^.

Cicero.
Nation was ever so barbarous or inhumane, but acknowledged one God or other.
In the second place, the Arrian, denying the divinity of our blessed Lord and
Savior, whom the Tempore Constantini Imperatoris Arriana haeresis exorta, quae
corrupto orb toto, Britanniam etiam extra orbem tam long remotam veneno sui
infecit erroris; sed in Nicena synodo delecta atque damnata fuit.

Btd Eccles hist. lib. 1.
Nicene Council long ago condemned. In the third place is the
selfe-conceited, and opinionated heretic and schismaticke, who out of his
singularity, will draw other Conclusions out of the sacred Scriptures, which
the spirit of God and the holy Church never meant and intended. In the fourth
place, are all those Idolaters, lying undertakers, Cum Diogenes intueretur in
vita gubernatores, medicos atque Philosophos, animalium omnium sapientissimum
hominem este dicebat; cum autem inspiceret somniorum conlectores, vates, vel
hujusmodi caeteros, tunc nihil stult^us existimare homine dicebat.

Diog. Laert. in Diog.
Planetaries, Starre-gazers, who draw Conclusions out of their own observations
from the event of things; who because a Cloud moved this way, or was of that
color, or a Hare crossed his way, the Salt fell toward him, a Serpent passed
on his right hand, or a Fox on his left; Julius Caesar nulla superstitione aut
augurio deterreri potuit ab incaeptis; dum in Africam proficisceretur, in

things in the judgment of the wise not to be regarded;) therefore this or
that thing must not be done on this day. Again, those Necromancers, Witches,
and Enchanters, who are in a kind of league and confederacy with unclean
spirits. Such as was the Witch of Endor, possessed with the spirit of Python,
with whom Saul co^sulted to raise up Samuel when he went to war against the
Philistims. Again, those Iuglers, Charmers, Compounders of medicines, and
complexion-makers, who dasle and beguile the senses, presenting objects in
other shapes and forms than in truth they are. Such as were the Egyptian 2
Timoth. 3.8.
Sorcerers, Iannes and Iambres, who resisted Moses, whom Saint Paul compares
to false teachers, who under show and color of godliness, lead captive silly
women. Again, those cunning Wizards now adays called wise Suggestione quidem

Virgil.

women, but indeed are mere impostors, who in ancient time were said to
attain to their knowledge, subtlety, and craft, by eating the principal part
and members of some beast, in which they conceived to reside some special and
singular virtue, and so by a kind of (...) or transmigration, what virtue was
in them, must be conveyed over, and so they become as wife as those beasts.
Again, such as Prognosticate things by the Calculating of nativities, or by
Chyromancie, or Meteoroposcopie, or by any Witchcraft whatsoever. These and
many more of those various shaped monsters, are within the meaning of the Laws
borrowed from the Laws of the first Table. Nay, not those alone, but even they
also who seek for help and succor in any other, though of Acts 4.12.

the Saints, than in our blessed Lord and Savior, a reverend opinion as
examples and patterns of imitation the reverend Fathers have ever had of them,
and no Christian so barbarous as to conceive otherwise of them; but a divine
worship and adoration, the Fathers have denied them, and no Christian (unless
he will come within the penalty of those Laws) must give unto them.


Rustic: What is the penalty of those Laws I pray you?


Iurid: It is in some degree aequivalent to the nature of the offense; the
offenses being Crimina laesae majestatis, the punishments which the Laws of
God and of all Nations have ordained are Capital. The Levit. 20.6. Deuteronomy. 18.10.
soul that turns after such as have familiar spirits, and after Wizards, to
go a whoring after them, I will set my face against, says the Lord, and will
cut him off from the people. And again, that man or woman that has a familiar
spirit, or is a Wizard, shall surely be put to death, and their blood shall be
upon them; such punishments have the Laws of God provided for such
malefactors. Agreeable with those Laws were those Vide Concilium Carthaginense
5ca^.
Canonical Laws which were made about the year of our Lord 398. at a
general Council held under Arcadius and Honorius: by which Laws all the
drugs and relics of Idolatry were utterly abolisht and extinguished. Which
said Laws were made upon this occasion; The Heathens had long before given
forth, that in the year of our Lord 398. the Christians and Christian Religion
should be utterly extirpated and abolished; to the intent therefore that this
their vanity and vain ostentation might appear to the world, it was desired
by the Christians that what they had given forth of the Christian Religion,
might be manifested in extirpating of Idolatry; which request being thought
reasonable, it was decreed accordingly; in pursuit of which decree, it was
decreed in a general Council held at Ratisbone in the year of our Lord 742.
that every Bishop within his Diocese should have a vigilant eye and care, that
none of those Paganish Ceremonies, by which the silly people had been long
deluded, should ever be used amongst Christians. Agreeable likewise to those
Laws were the Laws of Constantine the Emperor, who provided fire for such
malefactors. Agreeable likewise unto them are the Brit. lib. 1. cap. 9.
fundamental Laws of this our Nation: and a special Writ framed by the
Cusitors of ancient time, reciting the Law of God as the platform, by which
the Laws that punish deliquents in this kind are formed; the form whereof we
may see in Fitzh: not. brev: page 269.


Rustic. I pray you go on as you have begun, and as you have showed me what
laws are derived out of the first and second Law of the first Table: so now
show me what Laws are derived out of the third Law of the same Table.


Iurid: I will satisfy you therein, and show you some thing more; I will first
show unto you, what it is to take the name of God in vain: secondly, I will
show you what are the Laws which punish such offenses: and lastly, I will show
you what punishments some have undergone that have incurred the danger of those
Laws, that by their examples, you may be warned and admonished.


Rustic* You shall understand that the name of God is then taken in vain,
either when with the little instrument of the body the tongue, whose proper
office is truly to express to the world the secret cogitations and
imaginations of the heart, and to glorify GOD, we belie the heart, and make
the world by her report believe one thing, when the heart intends another; as
when we dissemble and lie, swear and forswear, taking the holy Name of God in
our mouths to confirm what is said: or otherwise, when we do in our actions
silently profane the name of God, when being Disciples of Christ, and taking
denomination of Christians from him, we do commit those offenses, which the
Heathen Moralists, when they were upon the face of the earth would have been
ashamed to have done, which many of the Turks, and Mahumetans do abhor to
do, and which are not heard of among the most barbarous Indians: as when Sic
vivunt homines, tanquam mors nulla sequatur,
Aut velut infernus fabula vana foret.
Non redit in mentem, his olim motibus
Caelo cecidi^le L^ciferum, quibus nos caelum hodie speramus ^^^ndere.
Petrarch.
we spend our days and years, and times in all manner of licentiousness, in
riotting and drunkenness, in chambering and wantonness, in strife and
envying, in oppression and extortion, and the like. What do we else in doing of
these things but profane the Name of God, and bring the name of Christ into
contempt? How can he be said to be a Scholar of Pythagoras, that never
followed him in any of his footsteps, nor observed and kept any of his rules
and precepts? How can he properly be said to serve under such a General, that
was never with him in the field, or followed him a foot to any skirmish? How
can he be said to be a Christian, that runs a contrary course to the life of
Christ in all his actions? Certainly, he bears the name of Christ in vain,
and the name of Arrius or Atheist would better become him. Christ whilst he
was upon the face of the earth, was just and upright in all his actions, free
from oppression and doing of wrong to any; he was meek and lowly, free from
pride and ambitious thoughts, he was loving and peaceabl^ free from strife and
contention; he fasted and prayed often, free from riotting and drunkenness, or
a licentious course of life. If therefore we will be the Disciples of Christ,
and heirs of the inheritance which he has purchased for us, we must tread in
the paths which he has beaten out unto us; and imitate him in the whole
course of our lives and conversations, it is to do well, which gives life and
being to a Christian; for in vain do we term our selves Christians, when as
we do the works of the Gentiles; it is but dissembled sanctity, double
iniquity; God will not be Vide fabulam de Adolescente and Coquo; qua
ostenditur nihil mali non manifestu^ esse deo. Si quid turpe facis mortales

mocked* nor cannot be beguiled, he is able to discover our hypocrisies and
dissimulations; when as we make his Name but a cloak to free us from the
danger of the Laws of temporal Princes, and profess our selves to be
Christians, because we dare not acknowledge our selves to be Heathens, though
in the whole course of our lives we follow and imitate them. Plato lib. 11.
Plato takes notice of three sorts of Atheists. Of one who with his tongue
acknowledges there is a God, but denies him in his actions, and lives as if
there were none, whom he thinks worthy not of one, but of more deaths. A
second, that lives as if there were a God, yet with his tongue professes there
is none, to whom he enjoyneth five years imprisonment, and if that during that
time he does not decline his opinion, then to dye the death. A third, that
acknowledges there is a God, yet denies his providence on earth, to whom he
enjoyneth perpetual imprisonment, and no freeman ever to have access unto
him: and when he dies his bones to be carried out of the Country, and to be
left unburied. So with Plato the man that Non vox, sed votu^ no^ musica
chorduli, sed cor,
Non clamor, sed amor, clamat in aure dei.

Caudian.
life of a man prevails and persuades more than a great deal of smooth
Rhetoric: Sic loquere vt videam, was a wise speech of a Heathen. It is said
of Tacit. lib. 3. cap. 12.
Vespasian in Tacitus, that his example prevailed more with the multitude, than
a multitude of Laws could have done in the redressing of diverse abuses. If we
will be Christians, then let us show our selves in our Conversations to be so:
let us set before our eyes the example of Barlet: lib. 2. de vlta and gestis
Scanderbegi.
Scanderbeg, who for the Catholic Faith, in the behalf of his blessed Savior
and Redeemer, exposed himself during the whole course of his life, to
continual perils and dangers against the Turks. Let us set before our eyes
likewise the examples of the blessed Martyrs, that are now Saints in heaven,
that suffered such persecutions for his sake alone: and if we cannot do as
they did, yet let us Cum Athenas Pisistratus occupasset, and Solon videbat
conatu^ omnem frustra esse, prolibertate scutum and arma ante fores Curiae
ponens, oo patria (inquit) tibi and dictis and factis opitulatu^ sum.
with Solon do what we can. Est aliquid prodire tenus, si non datur vltra.
Horat.
Even good endeavors are acceptable unto God. Let us seriously take into our
considerations the shortness of this life, and the durable estate of the life
to come. Let us assure our selves what a This, or to this effect have I seen
written with the Queens own hand, and her name to it subscribed, with this
perswasiue entreaty; Good Madam for my sake remember this. It is to be seen
in a Manuscript sometimes Prince Henry's, given to the Vniversity-Library in
Oxonf. by Mr. Connock, and remains in the Custody of my good friend Mr. Rous.
Queen of England once writ to one of her maidens of honor, is most true:
That if in virtue we take any pains:
The pain departs, but virtue remains.
But if we take pleasure to do that is ill;
The pleasure departs, but the ill tarrieth still.
Let us know, that two ways are set before us, the one wherein our blessed
Savior walked, whose paths are thorny and slippery in the beginning, but
green and pleasant in the ending: the other wherein his enemies walked, plain
and even at the first setting out, but full of bogs and quagmires and gulfs in
the ending; the one leading unto life, the other to death and destruction. Let
us with Mary choose the better part, and while Da dum tempus habes, tibi
propria sit manus haeres. A^feret hoc nemo, quod dabis ipse Deo.
we have time, do some deeds of Charity, and not defer the doing thereof
until the hour of our death; for when the gloomie night of death and
sickness approach, it is too late to offer up those sick sacrifices, for then
we cannot properly be said to give but to leave those things behind us which
we could not carry with us. God will not be so served, it is vain and idle to
think, that when we have lived in all manner of licentiousnes, robbed the
fatherless and widows, that by giving of those sick sacrifices, to pray for
our souls, we should save our souls, no, those good deeds which do open
heaven-gate when we die, must be such as do attend an innocent, harmless,
and well led life. Let us therefore, I say, do good while we may; sheede a few
Quanta jucunditas, pro paucis lachtymis interminabilem risum, pro temporalibus

Petrarch.
penitential tears here, that we may enjoy eternal bliss and happiness
hereafter. Let these contemplations take up our serious thoughts and
meditations; and let the practice hereof be our professions, so shall we
deserve the name of Christians, and avoyde the penalty of the Laws derived
out of this third Law of the first Table.


Rustic: You have sufficiently showed me what it is to take the Name of God in
vain. In the next place, I shall put you in mind of your promise, to show unto
me what are the Laws which punish such as presumptuously abuse the Name of God.


Iurid: I shall therein satisfy you likewise. The Laws which punish such
offenders, are comprehended by the Canonists under these titles, De
blasphemijs, de diris execrationibus, and de vero vsu nominis Dei, and

Rustic: But what is the penalty of those Laws?


Iurid: That part I will leave to the Canonists, as being their proper office
to show unto you. Only I will acquaint you what punishments some have
undergone and suffered by the immediate hand of God, for transgressing of them:
and for your satisfaction therein, look into the book of God, and
Ecclesiastical Histories, and you may satisfy your self. You shall there
behold how Numb. 16.
Corah, Dathan, and Abiram went in perfect health to their graves, the earth
opened and swallowed them up, because they abused the Name of God, and
presumptuously rebelled against him. Daniel 4.
How Nebuchadnezar was turned out into the field to gra^e like an Ass, because
he did the like: how Esaias 37.
Senacherib with his whole Army, being a hundred fourscore and five thousand
perished for reproaches which he used toward the living God. Joseph. lib. 12.
cap. 2o. de antiquitate Iudaeor.
Josephus reports of Theopompus a Philosopher, that because he did presume to
insert among his profane Writings, certain things which were delivered by
Moses to the Children of Israel, by special revelation from God, that he was
on a sudden bereaved of his senses. It is reported likewise in the
Ecclesiastical Histories, of a certain scoffer that falling into argument
with his Pot-Companions in a taphouse of the immortality of the soul,
maintained that there was no such thing as the soul, but that it was a mere
illusion and invention of the Priests to terrify the people, and to get a
living by. Which his Companion hearing, being desirous to beat him from that
Atheistical opinion, told him, that the Patriarchs, the Prophets, and
Evangelists, and the Fathers in all the general Councels, nay the very
Heathens themselves generally did all maintain the immortality of the soul.
To whom the Atheist replied; that at all adventures he would sell his for a cup
of Wine, and in the end the Devil in humane shape appears and gave him his
demand: and (as the Story says) animam per aerem avehit Satanas; took away
his soul with him. Joseph. ibid.
It is reported likewise of Theodactes a Tragical Poet, that in a certain
Tragedy of his having taken certain things out of the sacred Scripture, and
inserted them among his own profane Writings, he was struck blind, (and as
the Story says, Glancomate suffusus.) It is reported likewise of Aelian. lib.
4 de varijs historij^.
Pherecides, a Tragical Poet, that he was used to say, that he never offered
Hecatombas, sacrifices to God, yet he led a more quiet life, and had all things
in more abundance, than they which continually attended and served at the
Altar: but this his blasphemous babbling escaped not unpunished, for not long
after he was sore troubled with a continual sweat; which bred such store of
worms and lice in his body, that (as the Story says) he dyed dephthiriasi of
a loathsome lousy disease. Such were the punishments that these Atheistical
blasphemous bablers underwent for abusing Gods holy Name. God is a jealous God
and will not suffer his name to be traduced: and no marvel; for if an
Artificer shall be so careful of his reputation, that he will not suffer
himself to be defamed, but that he will have satisfaction for the wrong done
unto him, for that his credit is his livelihood. If a Peer of the Realm shall
be so tender of his honor, that he will not admit of the least aspersion, but
he will right himself, and take advantage of the Laws de scandalis Magnatum.
If the sacred Majesty of a King will not endure to have any rumors raised,
whereby his government may be scandalized, and dissension grow between him and
his people, but he will have a strict account of it; much more the King of
Kings and Lord of Lords. The Heathen Cicero lib. 1o. Officior. -- Tristia

Orators did ever hold it for a most unseemly and absurd thing, either in re
seriajocari, or in rejocosa serium esse. Sophocles did never more forget
himself, than he did at that time when as he being Praetor with Pericles, and
they with others in a serious consultation of the affairs of the
Commonwealth, cried out, O puerum pulchrum Pericle, seeing a fair boy coming
by him. And certainly, Comaedians do never more transgress the Rules of
Poetry, nor commit greater solaecismes, than they do at those times when in
their sports and pastimes they carelessly invocate the divine power. Comedies
have ever been allowed in all ages, and necessary it is they should be for the
trayning up of youth to exercise their wits, and inventions, and to embolden
them, to make them fit for employment when they come to riper years. It is the
abuse which makes the Frenchman in the Courtier term them Castilio lib. 2.
Buffones; and Justinian to rank them with them, Qui notantur infamia, as when
they do enterlace profane things with divine, Scripture with vain and idle
inventions. What can be more absurd, then when Cato is giving a Charge in the
Senate House, to induce a fiddler or jugler? What can be more gross, than when
Iocasta with her two twins Eteocles and Polynices lie wallowing in their blood,
coming to their ends by untimely deaths, and all the spectators mourning in
sables, and lamenting those unfortunate accidents, to induce a Mimicke to show
some tricks unto them? What can be more incongruous on the other side, than for
a Comaedian in his sports and pastimes profanely to use the sacred and
reverend Name of God? The Orators in former ages did sometimes break forth out
of serious discourses into witty Apophthegmes, but what was ye end of it? it
was to revive and exhilarate the spirits of their Auditors, whom they had
wearied with a Prolixita^ ex rebus non ex literis judicatur. Homerum aut
Virgilium cum versuum millia scripserant, nemo hactenus multiloquos aut longos

Sed tu ( Cosconi) distica longa facis.

long discourse before, but never used any direful oaths and execrations.
Learn you Comaedians, and beware by the examples of Theodactes, Theopompus and
Pherecides. God is the same God, his hand is not shortened, nor his power
abated: the Story of Quid fuit vt tutus agitaret Daedalus alas,
Icarus immensas nomine secit aquas.
Nempe quod hic alie, demissius ille volabat.

take it into our mouths, but with fear and reverence. Thou shall not take my

Rustic. You have showed sufficiently what Laws are derived out of the three
first Laws of the first Table. I pray you go on as you have begun unto the
rest.


Iurid: In the next place I will show you what is meant by the word Sabbath.
Secondly, how many Sabbaths the Jews observed. Thirdly, how they came to be
altered and changed. Fourthly, what Laws have been derived out of this Law,
for the observation of the Sabbath of days, and what care and provision has
been taken for the due execution of them. You shall understand, that the word
Sabbath, properly signifies a Cessation and rest from our labors: so that the
Jews named all their festival days by the name of Sabbath, because y^ upon
those days they did no manner of labor: yet they ever preferred three
Sabbaths before the rest: the first whereof was the Sabbath of days, which is
the seventh day: the second was the Sabbath of years, which was every Levit.
25.
seventh year, in which there was no planting nor grafting, no lopping nor
topping; all mountains and valleys, and all the trees of the Forest from the
Cedar to the shrub, being in some sort sequestered from the use of the owner for
that year; for as the Lord appointed the seventh day for man to rest, so he
appointed the seventh year for the Land to rest. The third was the Sabbath of
Levit. 25.
seven times seven years, which was their great Sabbath, and therefore
called the Sabbath of Sabbaths; in which as there was nothing put in execution,
that was prohibited on the Sabbath of years, all Lands being freed from
agriculture as they then were: so there were diverse other privileges and
prerogatives incident to this year, which were not to the former. If any man
had morgaged or sold his land, it was this year to return home again,
unless they had been houses within some walled Towns, and they likewise, if
they had been the houses of God, of the Church, and of the Levites. If any had
been bound this year, he with his family were to be free, and to return to
his own possessions; wherefore this year was called the year of Iubile, or
the year of mirth and jollitie. By which they accounted all their years, as
the Graecians did by their Olympiades. Which custom continued in use long
amongst them, even until the coming of our blessed Lord and Savior.


Rustic: How came they to be altered and changed?


Iurisp: I will briefly show unto you, and first how the Sabbath of days was
altered. The Jews were grown to that height of impiety, that if the Romans
had not vanquished them when they did, Joseph. de bello Iudaico. lib. 6.
Josephus thought the very earth would have opened and swallowed them up; and
Ammianus Marcellinus reports of them, that wheresoever they came they were
called faetentes Iudaei, stinking Jews. The Christians therefore that they
might be distinguished from them, utterly abolisht their day and their
Ceremonies.


Rustic. How came it to pass, that the Jews should be so odious, seeing that
among all Nations of the world none were more strict than they in the due
observation of the Sabbath, they would not admit of a bit of meat to be baked
or boiled, nor a spark of fire to be kinled on that day, because they supposed
the doing thereof to be a work repugnant to their Laws? Nay, they would not
in defense of their lives wage any battle on that day, until Matthias one of
their Captains made a Proclamation that in defense of their lives and
liberties it was lawful for them to fight on the Sabbath day. Antiochus and
Pompey could not so easily have prevailed against them, had they not known
their resolutio^s to have been to die rather than to fight upon that day. How
I pray you became the Jews so odious, seeing they were so observant of the
Sabbath day?


Iurisp: It is true; the Jews did forbear all manner of bodily labor on the
Sabbath day; but this forbearance was not to a good end, that is, to glorify
GOD, as they should have done. If they had been sensitive Creatures only,
such as had a mere sensitive being in the world, as Oxen or Horses, they had
done well, and satisfied the Law punctually, but they were reasonable
Creatures, God had stamped his own image in them, and made them little
inferior to the Angels in degree; wherefore there was more required at their
hands, they were not to sit still and sleep, but to glorify him with hymns,
songs, music, and melody. Deeds of Charity and necessity are allowed by
God to be done on that day. God that allowed man to lead his Ox and Ass to
water on that day, allows him to kindle a fire to dress his meat on that
day. Indeed to kindle a fire to add furtherance to the building of the
Tabernacle was not permitted. God that created all Creatures for the use of
man, allows him in case his sheep or cattle do fall into a ditch, to pull
him forth on that day. God who is abundant in mercy, allows us to relieve
our brethren in misery and necessity on that day. Math. 12.12.
Bonum est benefacere in Sabbatho, Christ that healed the sick on the Sabbath
day, allows the Physician on that day. Almesdeeds, deeds of Charity, and
holy recreations, which enable us to go on more chearefully in the duties of
our Callings, are at all times acceptable both before God and man. Wherefore as
it is profane to think, that there is no time to be allotted for divine and
holy meditations, Initio mundi dies naturales distincti fuerunt in festos and
profestos; profesti erant sex dies septimanae, in quibus volebat deus vt
homines operarentur, idque suo exemplo; festus erat septimus dies in septimana
in qua volebat homines feriari a rebus profanis and vacare cultui divino. Apud
Romanos fuerunt tria dierum genera, festi, profesti, and intercisi, qui dei,
and hominum erant communes; hoc est, quorum vna pars cultui divino, altera
negotijs humanis impendebatur.

Zench^ lib 6. de luminaribus caeli.
so it is Jewish to conceive there is no time to be allowed for holy and
necessary recreations. The Wiseman tells us, that there is a time for all
things, as there is a time to sow in, so there is a time to reap in, as there
is a time of mourning, so there is a time of rejoicing; as there are six days
to work in, so there is one day sequestered to glorify God in: so sweetly has
the Almighty disposed of the times and seasons for the use of man. Plutarch
has a pretty tale in the life of Themistocles, of the falling out of ye
Working-dayes and Holy Days; Upon a time the Working-dayes brawled with the
Holy Days, and repined that what they carefully got, they wastfully spent;
unto whom the Holy Days answered, Where had you been, if I had not been
before you, and if I were not, alas, what would you be. Indeed the one without
the other could not well be; for as the Working-dayes give a being to the
Holy Days, so the Holy Days reciprocally yield a well-being comfort and
solace unto them. We ought not therefore so to spend our days, as if there
were no nights, nor yet the nights as if there were no days, not so to labor,
as if there were no time to rest, nor yet so to rest, as if there were no time
to labor; but as the night succeeds the day, and as the seventh day does the
six days of the week, so to mingle society with retiredness, Actio and
contemplatio disjungi nolunt; neutra enim sine altera perficitur; sit ergo
vnusquisque vt gladius ille delphieus vtrinque secans, ad agendum and
contemplandum paratus. Sic Alexander non minus in re litteraria, quam orbis
Imperio principatum ambivit. Sic Cyrus Xenophontis libros nunquam de manibus
ponere solebat; cum vero in Africam trajecturus, et quadraginta quinque tantum
dies ad fabricandam et instruendam aciem insumpsisset, tot etiam inter
consultationes in gymnasio libellis etiam operam dabat.
Contemplation with action, that one night give comfort unto the other, and
both to us, to this only end, to glorify God our blessed Lord and Savior.
The which because the Jews did not, but went no further than the bare letter
of the Law, the outside only, they rested, but not to glorify God, therefore
did God abhor their Sabbaths: and the Christians that they might be
distinguished from them, set up a new day, the next day following; yet made use
of the moral part thereof, as a handmaide in the institution of the Lords day.


Rustic: Was this foolish superstition of the Jews the only cause wherefore
the Christians did alter the day?


Iurisp: It was one, but not the only cause, for among many other reasons, in
a general Council held at Paris under the Emperors Lewis and Lotharius,
these are alleged; that upon the day next following the Sabbath of the Jews
our blessed Savior arose from death to life, and Manna was sent from Heaven*
see the Binius
general Council for your further satisfaction. So you see how the Sabbath of
days in use among the Jews came to be altered and changed.


Rustic: But how came the great Sabbath the Iubile to be altered?


Iurisp: How came Rome to be changed, she was sometimes the Mistress of the
world, a virgin pure and immaculate, unto whom all Christian Princes did yield
obeisance, and adore her for her innocence and purity; but afterward she
became a strumpet, a mercenary strumpet, exposed her self for a little profit
to all sorts of suitors: which when the Princes saw, they scorned and neglected
her. The Iubile was sometimes a year of mirth and jollitie, of liberty and
freedom; and for that purpose was it instituted in the Commonwealth of the
Jews, and ordained to be solemnized every fiftith year. For that purpose
likewise was it that Pope Plat. in vita Bonif. 8. Onuph. in Bonif.
Boniface the eighth instituted the same at Rome, and commanded it to be
sole^nised every hundred year, in the year 1300. For that purpose likewise
was it that Pope Plat. in vit. Clem. 6. Onuph. in Clem.
Clement the sixth ordained it to be celebrated every fiftith year, according
to the manner and custom of the Jews, in the year 1350. But for another
purpose was it, that is to say, for profit and Commodity that Pope Plat. in
vit. Bonif. 9. Onuph. in Bonif.
Boniface the ninth, did cause it to be celebrated and solemnized in the year
of our Lord 1400. for he made it a mere market and fair for pardons and
indulgences. For profit and Commodity likewise was it that Pope Plat. in vit.
Xisti 4^^. Onuph. in Xisto.
Xistus the fourth reduced the solemnization thereof in the year of our Lord
1475. to every five and twentieth year, for he knew well that if it were
contracted into fewer years, greater profit would arise, and therefore changed
the time of the solemnization thereof from the fiftith to the five and
twentieth. For profit and commodity likewise was it that Pope Plat. in vit.
Alexand. 6. Onuph. in Alexand.
Alexander the sixth gave license and authority in the year 1500. that the
same might be solemnized and celebrated in certain Provinces, wherein his end
was, as one has well observed, that fewer people and more money might come to
Rome. So that I may well conclude upon these premises, that as the old
Comaedians were used to end all their Comedies in music, marriages, mirth and
jollitie: so the end and scope in solemnising of this, in these latter times,
has been profit and commodity. Old Geffry Chawcer seeing these abuses, being
a Contemporanean with Pope Boniface the ninth, and being well acquainted with
the occurrences of the time as well Chawcer was in his youth of Merton College
in Oxonf. and of the Inner Temple, as it is conceived; afterward he was
employed as Ambassador.

See his life.


abroad as at home, who died in the same year that Pope Boniface the ninth
solemnized his Iubile, being in the year of our Lord 1400. in some indignation
falls upon him in manner following. They said that Peter had the Key,
Of heaven and hell to have and to hold:
I trow Peter took no money,
For no sins that he sold.
Such successors been to bold.
In winning all their wit their wrall.
Her conscience is waxed cold.
And all such faitors foul hem fall.
Peter was never such a fool
To leave his key with such a lorell.
And so goes on bitterly. And William of Malmesburie, a Monk, who lived in the
days of King Henry the first, and dyed about the beginning of the reign of K
Henry the second, in a mournful kind of Elegy with tears bewayling the
miserable estate of Rome as it then stood, and I fear in no better case at
this day; amongst many other Verses of Hildebertus an Archbishop, has these
following. Romani olim rerum domini, nunc dicuntur homines inertissimi, auro
trutinantes justitiam, pretio vendirantes Canonum regulas.

Matthew Paris, a Monk of Saint Alban, is full of such complaints in every
corner of him. Gwicciardine in his History of Italy tells us, that Pope Leo
granted Gwicci^^d. lib. 13. Anno. 1520.
Indulgences without respect of time or place, and that his Ministers did set
to sale upon a game at Tables power to redeem souls out of Purgatory. John
Rosse in the Ghost of Chadwallader thus complains. Haeccine relligio est

seduce the people from their alleagiance to their Sovereigns? to betray their
Countries, to delude the world with equivocations and mental reservations? O
Rome, Rome, how much art thou departed from thy first station? thou wast
sometimes a guide and light unto other Nations, of justice, piety and
Religion; but now thou art become a sink of uncleanness, and with thy
filthiness do annoy and infect the whole world. Thy ambition, thy ambition
is the cause of all, being blinded and bewitched with a greedy desire of
filthy lucre: thou respectest neither Law nor honesty, nor the good of thy
Country. Do the Jesuits thus persuade thee, do they thus instruct thee? I
fear they do, for that now adays he scarce deserves the name of a Roman,
that dare not undertake to betray his Country; alas, alas! all things are out
of order, wickedness sits where honesty was used to do, and what thy
forefathers wrought by entreaties and gentle persuasions, now adays is wrought
with fire and faggot. Religion which binds the Conscience, is made a mere
scarecrow and instrument of delusion, and the handmaid of Tyranny. Let him in
the name of God that desires to gain sheep unto his flock, use his best
means to do it: but let him do it as he should do it, with persuasions and
entreaties, not with force and violence. O Rome, Rome, how art thou fallen, I
say, from thy first station! thy Senators in former times caused that Runnagate
that offered himself to kill their enemy Pyrrhus, to be bound hand and foot,
and to be turned out of the City. When Caesar overcame Pompey in the
Pharsalian fields, and Pompey betook himself for refuge unto the Coasts of
Nilus, where Achillas in stead of protecting him, slew him, and presented his
head unto Caesar, thinking thereby to win Caesar's love and favor. But Caesar
disdaining so base and ignoble an act, would not endure to look upon him, or
his present. When Apophroditus had killed Nero, though he were the monster of
men, a tyrant, and stood condemned according to the Laws and Customs of the
Romans, and though he slew him at the earnest request and solicitation of
Nero himself, yet as soon as ever the Senate heard he made his vaunts in
public of what he had done, they caused him to be put to death. Such, such
was the goodness, virtue, and prowess of the Romans in times past. But how
unlike are you unto them: if your forefathers that were Heathens, were so
tender of the lives of their enemies; how much more tender ought you to be that
fight under the banner of Christ, of the lives of your Kings and Princes; it
was a merry and golden world in those days; but alas the times are now
altered; now Simonie bears the bell in the Church; now either frozen
ignorance, or ignorant fiery zeal sets the Church at variance in it self. It
is sufficient now if a man have a form of godliness, and make a good show of
Religion, let him live never so vitiously, it is no matter; now in Court
ambition, luxury, envy, faction, flattery, lying are the only things in
request, and he that cannot lie or dissemble must forsake that course of life,
or not thrive by it. The Nobility themselves hunt after profit, and neglect
their honor; for these two, filthy lucre and true honor, are incompatible,
and cannot inhabit in one and the self same place together; yea the very
Courts of Justice, which should be kept more pure and clean than other places,
are not without spots and blemishes, and the places of judicature bought and
sold, and how then can a man expect justice to be duly administered; if the
egg be rotten, the chicken will stink and putrify a great deal more without
doubt. Hence it is that suits, debates, and contentions continually arise.
Hence it is that the rich man goes to Law with greedines, whilst the poor man
faints under the burden; the cause of the one being ended with all expedition,
and the cause of the other hanging in suspense: so that the rich man ever
prevails with his money, and the poor man ever goes to the ground. If a man
cast his eyes upon the Citizens and Cities, there he shall find nothing but
fraud, perjurie, usury, whoredom, treachery, drunkenness, luxury,
wantonness. Amongst whom to deceive is accounted the chiefest wisdom, and to
be wise the greatest folly. An ill conditioned people, that relish nothing
well but filthy lucre. To conclude, the whole world is nothing else but a mere
mass of wickedness: here enemies spoil, there thieves kill: here the Atheist
makes a mere mockery of the sacred Word: here the Father sets snares to entrap
the son, there the son to entrap the Father. So that here we may see the
world grows to an end, and every thing worse and worse. Wherefore things
standing as they do, what should I stay here any longer; more content I find
in my Stygian houses, wherefore I take my leave, and bid you farewell, and so
the Ghost departed. So much has Rosse of the abuses of the Court of Rome at
this day. Of the abuses at Rome, see more in Bocchas, in the first day of his
Decameron and second Novell.



Rustic: You have said enough of Rome to make a man loath and detest her, if it
be true which you have said.


Iurisp: Of the truth thereof I make no doubt, for though I saw it not with
mine eyes, yet I speak from the months of such as were eyewitnesses, and were
men of credit and reputation.


Rustic: I pray you yet satisfy me this one doubt, whether in the time of
Gregory the great, Indulgences, or as Peter de Valentia terms them, godly
deceits, were bought and sold as they have been since?


Iurisp: No certainly, in his time there was no such thing used, nor for many
years after, until the time of Plat. in Bonif. 9.
Boniface the ninth, which was eight hundred and odd years after; but then
Ita passim vendebantur vt jam vilescere clavium and litterarum Apostolicarum

Rustic: How came it to pass, that he did not grant them as freely in his
Iubile as his predecessors had done?


Iurisp: The pomp and retinue of the Popes was grown so Tanta est hodie

great, and they so swollen with pride and aspiring thoughts, that the ordinary
revenue could not support it, wherefore needful it was that they should think
of some new projects and inventions. It was not in the days of Boniface the
ninth, as it was in the days of Peter, or when Gregory the first lived. It
was now an ignominy to say, Gold and silver have I none, and to ride upon an

whereof, all things became vendible, Parsonages, Prebendaries, and
Cardinalships, and what not. They maken Parsons for the penny,
And Cannons and her Cardinals.

Marcus Cato says, that not only Cato himself, but his Officers were free
from briberie and corruption. And Chawcer speaking of the Popes, says, that
not only the Bishops themselves, but their officers do pill and pole the
people, and the Church of God. The Bishops Officers gone full gay,
The poor to pill, is all their pray.

Nero and Maximian, two of those ten bloody persecutors that occasioned the

Rustic: Sir, you have given me good satisfaction concerning the alteration of
the Iubile, and the changing of the times for the solemnizatio^ thereof. I pray
you show me now what are the Laws which have been derived out of this fourth
Law of the first Table, for the due celebration of those days and times, and
what care and provision has been taken for the due observation of those
Laws, especially for the Laws made for the keeping of the Lords day.


Iurisp: You shall understand, that the Laws hence derived, are comprehended
under those titles de ferijs et Ceremonijs, de festis locisque deo dicatis, de
sacrilegijs, de ministris Ecclesiae, Episcopis and Clericis.


Rustic: What care has been taken for the observation of those Laws?


Iurisp: Marry this Care; that no servile work was ever to be done and
performed upon this day, because it was a day which God had set apart for
himself; and therefore in the time of the primitive Church they did disburden
themselves of worldly cares, which did glue and fasten them to the earth; and
took into their considerations, those sweet and holy meditations of the birth
of our blessed Lord and Savior, of his passion and resurrection. Again, this
Care has been taken, that upon this day divine service is to be celebrated,
whither Vide in reformatione legum Ecclesiasticarum ab H. ^. and Ed. 6.
provecta; cap. 2^. de divinis officijs.
every one is to come, unless he have some lawful excuse: and for default to
be punished by the head of the Church, or his Substitute, by infllicting on
them a certain mulct, as he or they in their discretions shall think fit.
Again, upon this day the Supper of the Lord is to be administered, and no man
to dare to come unto it Ad sacrosancta^ Domini mensam nemo debet assumi, cujus
fides omnibus partibus perfecta non sit.
vnpreparedly; and therefore this care has been taken, that every one that is
to be a Communicant, is to resort the day before unto him, unto whom the Care
of Souls is Committed, to the intent that he may try and examine him, and if
he find him either ignorant, or contumacious, or wavering, to instruct, to
correct, and to confirm them. Likewise this care has been taken, that this
great Supper of the Lord is not to be administered, but where there is a Si
mensae Domini legitimus Convivarumnumerus defuerit, nullam potius quam
solitariam esse volumus; sed Minister ingrata^ et impiam populi negligentiam a
criter objurgabit, quod ab vsu celeberrimi pretio sissimique sacramenti se
removeant ibid. C. 8.
Competent number of Communicants. For this great feast has a kind of
resemblance to our usual feasts, where the worth and multitude of the guests,
are the glory and honor of the feasts. So careful has the Church been in
the due observation of this holy day. In pursuit whereof, the Kings and
Queens of England have been no less careful of it. King Edward the sixth by
an Act of Parliament made in the fifth and sixth year of his reign, and
Queen Elizabeth by an Act of Parliament made in the first year of her reign,
did in a manner confirm what ye Church had before agreed upon in their
several Synods and Convocations, in the days of King Henry the eight and King
Edward the sixth: and in those several Acts of Parliament, gave special
Charge and Command to the Archbishops, Bishops, and other Ordinaries to see
the Laws made touching the same, to be duly put in execution, as they would
answer before God for such evils, wherewith Almighty God may justly punish
his people for neglecting such good and wholesome Laws; giving authority
likewise to the Justices of peace at the quarter Sessions to enquire of the
same, and to punish the delinquents, by such ways and means as in the said
Acts are limited and appointed. So careful were those Princes to make Laws
for the due observation of this day. And in this they did but imitate their
forefathers: for I find in the Vide Lambert de priscis Anglorum legibus, inter
leges Inae.
Saxon Laws amongst the Laws of Ina before the Conquest, that if a servant
had done any work by his Masters command, he was presently to be made free,
and the Master was to pay 30. s. If he did it without warrant from his
Master, he was to be whipped. If he were a freeman that had done it, he was to
be a bondsman, and to pay 60. s. If he were a Minister, and did serve at the
Altar, the punishment was double as much as was to be inflicted upon other
transgressors. In the days of King Vide Lambert inter loges Edw:
Edward before the Conquest, there was another Law made to prohibit
Marchandizing and Trading upon that day. By which if a Dane had bought or sold
any thing upon that day he was to pay so much; if an Englishman a great deal
more. The Laws likewise now in force, are very tender of the observation of
this day, and will not allow of any Iudices seculares non possunt
jurisdictionem suam, neque placita aut judicia quaecunque exercere diebus ab
Ecclesia indictis, and in quibus populus feriari et cessare solet ab omni
opere, sub paena nullitatis little omnium actuum qui his diebus facti sunt.

Fish and Brockets Case.
day, the Proclamation is void for that cause, and why, because it is a day
exempt; and instituted for another purpose, and not to be numbered among the
Law-dayes. Such care and provision has been taken for the due observatio^ and
solemnization of this day.


Rustic: Sir, I do not wonder that our forefathers were so careful in the
making of Laws for the due celebration of the Lords day: for that I find
diverse of the Heathens, in the celebration of their days set apart for the
performance of their superstitious Rites and Ceremonies, to have come very
little short of them. For did not the old Graecians, before they received the
faith of Christ, or were honored with the title of that Church of which the
Erasmus Chrysostomum concionatorem mellitissimu^ Christique praeconem
indefatigabilem appellat, cui jure optimo (vt ait ille) ob sapientissimam
eloquentiam, and eloquentissimam sapientiam oris aurei cognomen tribuitur.
golden Father Saint Chrysostom, Saint Origin, Gregory Nazianzen, Theophylact,
Athanasius were principal members, being the Greek and Eastern Church,
observe for their Sabbath the first day of the month, and called it Neomaenia
or Novilunium? and did not the old Romans before they knew Christ, or were
honored with the title of that Church of which Saint Austin, Saint Ambrose,
Saint Hierome, Saint Bernard, Saint Cyprian, and Tertullian were pillars, being
the Latin and Western Church, strictly observe for their Sabbath the Nonae
dicuntur in Martio, Mai^, Iunio and October. sex illi dies qui primum sequuntur;
in reliquis vero mensibus quatuor tantum illi dies primum sequentes.
Nones and Ides? And did not the Macedonians strictly observe the day on which
Alexander was borne, on which Philip got two victories; the one by his Mares at
the games of Olympus; the other by his men of Arms in Thracia? And did not the
Persians observe strictly the day on which their rebellious Magi were subdued?
And did not the most barbarous Nations of the Heathens, set apart some time for
the adoration of their foolish and fantastical Idols, and strictly observe
the same?


Iurisp: It is most true. And certainly those Heathens that were a Law unto
themselves, knowing not the Law, shall one day give in evidence against the
professors of the Law and Gospel, for the breach of those Laws, which have
been made for the due observation of their Sabbath.


Rustic: I am well satisfied touching the Laws of the first Table; I pray you
go on unto the second Table.


Iurisp. As out of the Laws of the first Table, you have seen what Laws have
been made concerning divine duties. So out of the Laws of the second Table,
you shall now see what Laws have been made concerning Distributiva justitia
est personaru^ and officiorum ordinatio in omni vita publica and privata.

Hemming. Vt aedificaturus domum non lignum quodlibet quod casu oflertur,
substernit, sed quod est necessarium: ita in repub: non cuivis munus
magistratus imponitur, sed idon^o, and vbiliaec justitia non servatur, actum
est de salute reipub.

Hemming.
Distributive and Commutative Justice: and first I will show you the heads of
the laws which have been made out of the first Law of the second Table; then
what persons are comprehended within those Laws; then what duties are enjoined
by those Laws; then what punishments some have undergone for transgressing of
those Laws; then how careful many of the Heathens have been in informing
their Children in those duties; and lastly, of what antiquity these Laws are.
You shall understand, that the Laws hence derived, are comprehended under
these heads; de jure personarum de statu hominum, de officijs magistrat^um, de
officio praesulis and proconsulis, de liberis agnoscendis, de adoptionibus, de
tutela etc. and the persons which are comprehended within them, are as well
superior as inferior persons, as well Masters as servants, Tutors as Pupils,
Fathers as Children; for the word Father is taken in a diverse sense: there is
as well a politic as a natural father; Kings and Princes, subordinate
Magistrates and Governors, Masters of families, Tutors and guardians, and
generally all other as have any power over inferior and subordinate persons,
are said to be Fathers as well as those our natural parents that beget, breed,
and cloth us: and that all Laws which do bind Subjects in loyal obedience
to their Sovereigns, servants to their Masters, Pupils to their Tutors, are
hence propagated and derived, as well as those Laws which do bind Children
to their Parents. And as concerning the duties which are here enjoined by these
Laws, they are these specially. First, they do enjoyne See the duty of
Princes, servants, and followers, well set forth by Philip Commin: in his third
book and twelfth Chapter. Principibus placuisse viris non vltima laus est.

beginning. These and the like are the duties which these Laws enforce and
command.


Rustic. But what is the penalty, if a man fail in performance of these
duties in obedience to these Laws*


Iurisp: That is the next thing which I promised to show unto you, and for your
satisfaction, I would have you look into the Histories of the Heathens, and
see what befell unto Plu^. in Pausan*
Pausanias* his render hearted mother that would have been the first that
would have rewarded him, if he had done well, was the first that punished him,
because he did ill. Pausanias having conspired with the Persians against his
Country, being discovered, betook himself to the Temple of Pall^s, thinking
to have found safety and protection in the Sanctuary. But Justice whose hands
are long, and will not suffer such offenses to escape unpunished, surprised him
there, for the Ephori after some Consultation had did agree, that although they
could not in justice take him out, yet they might in justice keep him in: and
therefore decreed that the doors should be barrocaded, and that he should
suffer for want of sustenance; of which his Mother being given to understand,
she was the first that rolled the first stone unto the door. Look into
Lugdune^sis, and there you shall see this Story in effect, though delivered in
other terms. A tenderhearted Father, tendering more the welfare of his son
than himself, voluntarily yielded up his whole estate unto him, desiring no
more but a convenient lodging, with necessary food and raiment; the son for a
time suffered his Father to want nothing that was necessary; but ere long it so
fell out, that he married with a young Gentlewoman, who was so tender-eyed and
eared, that she could not endure the spitting and coughing of an aged man, and
being often troubled with queames (a thing incident to new married wives) she
ever imputed the cause thereof to the spitting and spawling of her aged father
in law, and took that occasion to remove him from her Table, and to have him
incorporated into the society of Dicke and Will, and the rest of the ragged
regiment, amongst whom it was designed that he should spend the remainder of
his days, the old Gentleman having now no better cloths than such fripperie as
the Hangmans wandrope does usually afford, nor better a lodging than the dogs
did usually kennell in, no better companions than the brothershood of the
black-guard and the ragged regiment, he began to grow lousy, whereof notice
being given to my young Master, he called order (...) to be bought for him to
make him shi^s, but so course as they that be held them did rather think them
enjoined him as alpenance for some offense com^^^d than for ordinary wearing
shirts, the which coming to the view of his little grandchild (for by that
time my young Master had a son of a prettiest (...) privily conveyed two of
the else of Cloth away, and being demanded what he meant to do within,
answered that he meant to keep it for his Father against he came to the years
of his grandfather. So is the (...) ingratitude and disobedience of Children
generally required by their Children. The like Story has Discipulus,
Discipul. de temp^^ Sermon. xxiiij. prope finem.
where he shows how God does take the (...) of a father into his hands, and
miraculously punishes a son for his disobedience, and it was as follows.

A tenderhearted Father having dispossessed himself of his estate, and made
his son Master of it; the son in requital caused him with his Mother to
be removed into a house to live by themselves, where wanting necessary food
upon a Sunday to dinner, he with his wife invited themselves to his sons
house, whither coming, and finding the doors fast shut, he knocked to come
in, but the son being given to understand, that his Father and Mother were
come to dyne with him, he caused assaturam the meat to be taken off the Table,
and instead of a dinner, staid their stomachs with a pair of single pence, and
so dismissed them; who no sooner were departed, but the meat was set on the
Table again, and (as the Story says) the first morsel that the son did
eat, was turned into bufonem, qui sic ei adhaesit vt pedes superiores cum
duabus maxillis vna caro fierent, into an ugly Toad; whose forefeete were so
fastened to his jaws, as if they had been incorporated into them whilst the
body of the toad did hang out of his mouth; to the beholding of which fearful
spectacle, a Priest being called, he openly declared, that it was the just
judgment of God upon him for his disobedience and careless neglect of his
Father, and forthwith caused him to besent to the Archbishop, before whom
confessing his offense, he enjoined him to be carried throughout all the chief
Cities and Villages of note in France, and the young men in every Village being
called together to be made acquainted how miraculously GOD has punished this
son for his disobedience; to the end that beholding the punishment, they
might be deterred from committing the like offense. Thus miraculously has God
in times past punished unnatural and disobedient Children. Look into the
sacred Scriptures, and read over the stories of Cham, of Reuben, of Absalom,
and of the sons of Heli, and in them you shall behold, set forth to the life,
the punishments due to disobedient children: Whosoever curses his Father or
Mother, shall dye the death, Levit. 20. Nay, whosoever obeys not his Father
and Mother, him shall the people stone, Deuteronomy. 21.


Rustic: But do temporal Laws punish those delinquents with death?


Iurisp: No, not immediately. Yet generally ruin and destruction is the end of
them; for when they fail in performance of these duties, and forsake their
fathers God forsakes them, and leaves them over to their unruly lusts and
affections, which lead them unto ruin and destruction. So that though these
offenses be not immediately punished with death, yet untimely deaths generally
wait upon them.


Rustic: I do not wonder then the duties being so needful, and the
punishments so great, that many of the Heathens were so careful in instructing
of their Children in the knowledge of these duties.


Iurisp: Nor I. In my opinion they might have passed for good Christians as
concerning the observation of those duties, had not their dij deaeque
discovered them to be Heathens. What people in the world was ever more careful
than the Lycurgus praecipiebat vt ne liberos suos vlli in vlla disciplina

Bucephalus, that were most tender and respective of their Masters. So that I
say, had not their dij deaeque discovered them to be Heathens, they might well
have passed for good Christians, as concerning the trayning up of their
Children in the duties enjoined by these Laws.


Rustic* Sir, hitherto you have given me good satisfaction, I pray you let me
crave an answer unto one question, and so I will forbear to trouble you any
further at this time touching these Laws of soveraigntie and subjection;
whether the Laws derived out of those sacred Laws, which do enjoyne the
duties before mentioned, had their original from ancient or from modern
times, or no?


Iurisp: Certainly, they had their original from the beginning of times, long
before the Laws of Moses were written, even from the Law of nature; for no
sooner had God reared up the great fabric of the world, but in the chiefest
place thereof he placed the Sun, and gave it a dominion over the rest of the
Planets; no sooner had he created the sublunary world, but he gave dominion to
the Lion over the beasts of the field, to the Eagle over the fowls of the
air, to the Whale over the fishes of the Sea, to the Cedar over the Trees of
the Forest: yea, no sooner did Adam begin to increase and multiply upon the
face of the earth, but he gave to every father of a family power and
authority over his family, yea no sooner did the waters in the days of Noah
betake themselves to their wonted Channels, and ^he Children of Noah to spread
themselves upon the ^ace of the earth, but he gave power and authority to ^he
sons of Iuphet and Sem, to govern and rule over the posterity of Cham, a
(d) servant of servants was he unto his brethren. So that you see that from the
beginning, long before the days of Moses, there was soveraigntie and
subjection, not only among the reasonable, but even among the inanimate
sensitive and vegetative Creatures.


Rustic: You have given me good satisfaction, I pray you go on, and show me
what Laws are derived out of the second Law of the second Table.


Iurisp: I will therein satisfy you; but first I will show whence this word
murder is derived, and what it is; then how the Civil and Common Law do
differ in setting froth the diverse kinds of Homicide; then the Laws that
punish those offenses, and lastly, the punishments that those Laws have
provided. You shall understand, that some will have the word Murder, to be
derived from the Latins of Mors dira, dira being an Epithet which they did
commonly use when they would set forth any thing to have happened in any
extreme manner, being borrowed from Dirae the furies or implacable spirits of
hell, as dirae depraecationes, detestatio dira, naufragia dira, mors dira,
aconita dira, lues or fames dira; others will have it to proceed from the
Saxon word Mordren, which is a wilful killing of a man upon malice before
thought: others from the French word Meurtre, which is Homicide or killing.
Homicide being then committed cum homo occiditur: others wayving the
Etimologies, as Bracton, Bracton lib. 3.
who lived in the days of King Henry the third, and Britton, Britton Cap. 6.
who lived in the days of King Edward the first, will have murder to be that
kind of Homicide, Quod nullo sciente, nullo praesence, nullo vidente, nullo
audiente, clam perpetratur: that was done so secretly that no man was present
at the doing of it, no man knew of it, no man saw it, no man heard of it; so
that it should seem by their descriptions, that no Homicide was sald to be a
murderer, unless he had done it closely and secretly, either by poisoning or
some magical Enchantments in invocating of some damned spirits, or by some
other secret means, of which no public testimony could be given. But in
after times it was manifestly expressed, that not only they whom Bracton and
Britton make mention of, but all other Homicides, who upon malice forethought,
do bereave any of the Kings Subjects, whether natives or aliens, under the
Kings protection, of their lives, are said to be murderers. Murder being a
wilful killing of a man in cold blood, upon malice forethought. In the setting
forth of the diverse kinds of Homicides, the Civilians do differ from the
professors of the Common Law; for the Civilians do reduce all manner of
Homicides to one of these three, either to Homicide done Fulbecks Parall:
ex casu, ex necessario, or ex destinato: In the first they do include all
such Homicides as are committed accidentally, as if it happen by the throwing
of a stone, by the shooting of an Arrow, or by the running of an Horse, or by
such like casual means, that one man against his will takes away the life of
another: In the second, they do include all such Homicides as happen to be
committed in the defense of a man's own person, or his possessions; as if a
Theife happen to assault him upon the Kings high way, or to break into his
house to rob it; or if upon any other occasion, a man is injuriously assaulted,
and in defense of his person, or possessions, death ensue: In the third, they
do include all such Homicides as are committed out of rancor or an inveterate
malice, when one man out of a deadly hatred sets upon another, and pursues him
to death. So do the Civilians distinguish the diverse kinds of Homicides; the
professors of the Municipall Laws of this Nation do otherwise distinguish
them, that is, by murder manslaughter without malice, felo de se, or killing
of ones self, manslaughter in his own defense, and manslaughter ex casu and
accidenti: So that whereas the Civilians do place felo de se in an equal
degree with murder, the Common Laws do distinguish them, because as it is
not an offense of so high a nature as murder is, unless it be committed by a
Malefactor upon himself, to prevent his trial by the Law, seeing that it
extends no further then to the person of himself, and is committed oftentimes
ex infortunio, either by reason of the extremity of some disease and
sickness, or by reason of some agony and perplexity of mind, yet on the
other side, it is not so much favored in the Law as an act done ex casu and
accidenti; and therefore aptly and upon good ground have the Common Laws
distinguished this kind of manslaughter from the other three, ex destinato, ex
casu, and necessario. Now although the Laws do vary as concerning the diverse
kinds of Homicide, yet do they agree in setting forth the nature of those
Homicides, for both Laws do agree that to be murder which is committed out
of an inveterate malice for some supposed offense to be given before; such as
was in the beginning of the world, the murder of Cain upon the beloved of God
his brother Abel. Homicide ex necessario they do likewise agree to be then
committed, when as the offender having used all means he can to prevent an
untimely death, is of necessity at last compelled to requite Hester 7. v. 10.
Haman with the reward which he provided for Mordochaeus. Homicide likewise ex
casu, they do likewise agree to be then committed, when as a man having no
evil in his thoughts, does yet notwithstanding against his will take away the
life of another, as it often happens in the cases before mentioned, in the
shooting of Arrows, the running of Horses, and the like, so far do both
Laws agree: the disagreeme^t then consists in this, the Civil Laws do
include all Homicides within these, ex casu, ex necessario, and ex destinato,
the Common Laws do not.


Rustic: Sir, you have sufficiently showed wherein the Laws do agree, and
disagree, concerning Homicides: I pray you in the next place, what are the
Laws that punish these Homicides?


Iurisp: The Laws which punish these Homicides, are comprehended under these
titles, de Homicidijs, de Parricidijs, de Sicarijs, de Talione, and the like,
which have been aptly termed by the Ancients either Laws of Plat. in Gorg.
Commonition or Laws of Animadversion.


Rustic: What are the Laws of Commonition, as you call them, I pray you?


Iurisp: They are such as are used to prevent and extirpate the growing evils,
and to take away the causes and occasions of those many quarrels, Combats,
manslaughters, and murders, which are so often committed in the Commonwealth:
which have their original most commonly from offensive provoking words,
afterward break forth into blows, until at last they come to mortal
strokes, wherefore the Per statuta vrbis Romae si quis alicui verba iniuriosa
animo honorem sugillandi dixerit, aut protulerit, paenam december ducatoru^ auri
incurrat; vel arbitrio senatoris corporali paena plectatur; personarum and

Vid. stat. vrbis Romae de verbis iniuriosis, cap. 71.
Laws have been ever careful to provide to prevent a mischief whilst it is
in growing, to nip the fruit whilst it is in the bud, to punish words in a
sharp and severe manner, blows in a more severe manner, and death that
ensues with the greatest severitie that may be. And for that purpose the Laws
have provided several actions according to the nature of the several wrongs
done and committed: actions of the Case to stop the mouths of brawling and
backbiting persons, and actions of Trespass and Mayhem, to bind to the peace
and good behavior, quarrelling offensive persons, which several actions may
well be said to be Laws of Commonitio fit, cum ei qui peccavit levi coertione
mulcta dicta est, vt ad been vivendum emendatior sit.

Plato in Gorgia and Alexand: ab Alexand. lib. 3. cap. 5.
Commonition, or warning pieces unto them, to advertise them to take heed how
they run into further danger.


Rustic: And what are the Laws of Animadversion, as you term them?


Iurisp: They are those Animadversio, non ipsius qui paena afficitur, sed
reliquorum qui supersunt gratia adhibetur, vt metu paenae reliqui eadem noxa
deterreantur.
Laws which punish delinquents, when an offense is committed, that by their
example others may be warned and admonished.


Rustic: And how are they punished?


Iurisp: Either by Inditements at the suit of the King, because that he has
lost a subject; or by appeal at the suite of the party, because that he has
lost a Father, a brother, or a kinsman.


Rustic: I pray you give me leave to expostulate a little with you concerning
the Laws of Commonition. Will you have a man to appeal to the Law for every
idle word that falls?


Iurisp: Old Geffery Chawcer will tell you Had I venged all my harm, My coat
had never kept me half so warm.

Chawcer.

redress.


Rustic: Flesh and blood cannot endure to hear himself to be called a To be
scandalized by the name of a Traitor, a murderer, a departer from his banner,
a ravisher, a false informer of his Sovereign, are scandals of the highest
nature; for whosoever is a Traitor, by the Laws of Arms is to have his
Coate-Armour raced, his Shield reversed, his Spear trunked, his Spurs hewn
from his heels, his horse docked, hi^ sword broken upon his helmet, his Crest
divided, his statues pulled down, his blood corrupted, his possessions taken
from him, and his body tortured quia memoriae eorum destrui debent.

A deflowrer of Virgins by the Laws of Arms, is to have his Eschutchion
reversed.

A teller of false tales to his Sovereign, is branded by the Laws of Arms
with a Diminution in his Coat; and so is a departer from his Captains Banner.


Traitor, a murderer of his father, a departer from his Captains banner, a
deflowrer of Virgins, a false informer, and teller of tales to his Sovereign,
neither to have the honor which he has purchased with the hazard of his life,
to be attributed to another, as when that he has been the first that has
issued out of a besieged City, and given the onset to the enemy, and made him
recoyle; and the last that has returned, or when that he has been the first
that has scaled the walls of a City, and set up his Ensign in honor of it,
and another has usurped and set up his; or when he has taken an enemy
prisoner, and brought home his Arms with him, and another has injuriously
challenged it; or when he has been the man that has guarded such a Fort,
kept such a bridge or passage, maugre all the fierce and furious assaults of
his Antagonists; or when on the other side, he has been the man that with the
peril of his life, and the lives of such as he has commanded, has driven
the enemy from such a Hold, or made his way with his sword over such a passage,
and another has challenged it: these things, I say, being against the Laws of
Arms, flesh and blood cannot endure, but it will discover it self in passion.


Iurisp: It is true, if a man had no m^^re then flesh and blood in him, then

let thy Combating be to rescue poor innocent souls from death and

which quarrel many Christian Princes were interessed, and many harmeles souls
like to suffer by it. Charles being moved as he made show with a Christian
compassion and Princely care, having in some respect, a care of such his
enemies as were drawn into the quarrel as friends and allies, by secondary
means made this proposition to the Kings Ambassador, that the Controversy
between them might be ended by a single Combat, which coming to the
understanding of the French King, he willingly embraced it, and glad he was to
have any occasion to requite him for the entertainment which he gave him at the
siege of Pavia: so that in a public assembly for that purpose called
together in the presence of all or most of the Princes of the blood, in the
presence of all foreign Ambassadors at that time residing in France: the
Emperors Ambassador being then present in his public Hall in his Court at
Paris he caused one of his Secretaries of State with a loud voice to read a
Cartell signed with his own hand, to this effect; that the Emperor accusing
him to have falsified his faith, had spoken untruly, and that as often as he
had or should say so, he gave him the lie; and to the end he should not defer
the deciding of the Controversy by the Combat, he wished him to appoint the
place, and that he would be ready with his Arms either on the Sea or on the
Land, on horseback or on foot, and that if he should not persevere in that
his resolution, he would proclaim his Cowardice to all the Christian world:

thieves, rogues, and vagabonds, until thou have undergone the sharp and
severe sentence of the Law; when thy Lands and goods shall be confiscate, and
it may be conferred upon thy persecutors; when thou thy self shall hang
tottering between heaven and earth as unworthy of either; when thy veins
shall become like Mare mortuum, and thy blood which was used like Crystal
streams to flow from thy liver as from a clear fountain, shall putrify and
be corrupted; when thy harmless posterity, the child unborn in his Mothers

therefore it thou will have honor on earth, or glory in heaven, thou must
observe and keep the Laws derived out of this sacred Law; Thou shall do no
murder.


Rustic: Sir, what are the Laws, I pray you, that are so strict, in Case a man
do happen unfortunately to commit wilful murder?


Iurisp: Even the Laws of thine own Country, which have for their warrant
the Laws of God: the Laws of all Nations do the like, yea, the Laws of the
most barbarous Heathens.

such malefactors?

beginning, and ratified by the Court of heaven, and to this day never

Scripture makes mention, suffered under it. Read but the story of Genesis 4.

done; punished is he in his posterity, his Children, poor Children that never
had evil in their thoughts, are in a sort bastardised and made incapable to

and enemies enjoy those things, which his Ancestors carefully gathered
together; punished is he in his death, an ignominious death does he undergo:
and well were it for him if his punishments might end there; but it cannot be;
death shall be but as a gate to let him in into a place, where, Gehennae

Rustic: But do the Laws of other Nations punish murder with such heavy
punishments as the Laws of England do?


Iurisp: Yes certainly: the Laws of the Heathens do so.


Rustic: How comes it to pass then that in Rome there was no Law to punish
Parricides?


Iurisp: Certainly Plutarch in (...)
Romulus never thought that any man was so barbarous to commit such a fact; who
being demanded this question, gave this reason: therefore the old Romans did
rather think these men to be Tygres and Wolves, than reasonable men, and
provided punishments for them accordingly; for they did usually put them into a
Alexander ab Alexandr^^ lib. 3. cap. 5.
sack, with an Ape, a Cock, and a Viper, to the intent that they might take
some reve^ge of them, and after cast them into Tyber: and the Alexand: ibid.
Persians did usually call such bastards, for they supposed they never had
Fathers.


Rustic: But how was murder and parricide among other of the Heathens punished?


Iurisp: If you search into the Laws and Customs of the Egyptians, Alexander
ab Alexand: lib. 3. cap. 5.
Diod. Siculus lib. 1. rerum Antiquarum. Cap. 3.

you shall find they did usually thrust long Needles under their nails and
toes, the tendrest parts of their bodies, and to cut off their flesh before
their faces, and to throw it into the fire. If into the Laws and Customs of
the Aethiopians, to have used in the City of Elephantina, Vide quomodo apud
Germanos, Lusitanos, Graecos, Macedones, Thebanos, homicida puniebatur.

Alexand: ab Alexand. lib. 3. cap. 5.
to have enforced the murderer to have tasted of the herb called Ophuisa,
which being taken would make his sleep to produce terrible and fearful
dreams, presenting unto them visions more terrible than death it self. So do
the Laws of other of the Heathens punish the same.


Rustic: Do the Laws, I pray you, punish all men alike, that happen upon any
occasion to kill a man?


Iurisp: No verily: they have a special eye and regard to the manner of the
fact; for as there are degrees o^ manslaughter, so there are degrees of
punishments: for if it be not committed ex destinato, of malice and set
purpose, then according to the Laws of God, with men there is mercy to be
found: by the Laws of God there were certain Deuteronomy. 19. v. 5. Loci refugij

Asyla, places of refuge permitted, whereunto the offender might fly and have
absolution; as when a man had gone to the Wood with his neighbor to hew wood,
and his hand fetching a stroke with the Axe to cut down the Tree, the head had
slipped from the helue, and wounded his neighbor, so that he dyed thereof; he
might have fled unto those places, and have found refuge. Some resemblance unto
those Laws have the Laws of Nations, especially the Stanford lib. 1. cap. 8.
Laws of the Nation wherein we live: if any such offender shall betake
himself to the Kings Court for refuge, the King will protect him as touching
his life: yet he shall not escape altogether unpunished; for as by the Law of
God, if a beast had killed a man, the beast was to be Exodus 21. v. 28.
stoned, and no man was to eat of his flesh. The Laws of our Nation have some
resemblance unto those Laws; for if it happen at any time a beast to Stanford.

kill a man, or a Cart laden with grain to go over a man, so that the party
dye by reason thereof, the owner shall escape with his life, yet the Ox, the
Cart, the Corn, and the grain, and all other things that did moove and
conduce to the death of the party, shall be confiscate. Agreeable with those
Laws were the Laws both in Athens and Rome; in Athens the statue of Nico was
adjudged to be Confiscate by the Areopagites, and to be cast into the Sea,
because it fell upon a man sitting under it, and slew him: in Sueton: in
Caesare.
Rome likewise the day, the month, and place, where Caesar was murdered,
suffered for his death; for upon that day by a general Consent of the Senate,
they were never to meet again in Consultation: the Ides of March being the
time when that bloody Massacre was committed, was named Parricidium, and the
place they caused to be dammed up, and never after to retain the name of the
Senate House. So did the things which could by no means be accessarie unto his
death, suffer for it. All which was to show how odious a thing murder is, both
in the sight of God and man. So you see, though no Homicide or murder escapes
altogether unpunished, yet the Laws have a special eye and regard to the
manner of the fact.


Rustic. Sir, you have given me good satisfaction, touching the Laws derived
out of these Laws. I pray you go on unto the third Law of the second Table,
and show me what the Laws are which are thence derived.


Iurisp: I will therein satisfy you: and first, I will show you what is said
to be Adultery in the eye of the Law; then how it is distinguished from Incest
and Fornication; then what are the Laws which punish offe^ders in those kinds;
and lastly, what the punishments are that those Laws have provided. You shall
understand, that Adulter and adulters dicuntur, quia ille ad alteram, and haec
ad alterum se confert.

Spieg.
Adultery is then properly said to be committed, and he or she to be an
Adulterer or Adulteress, who having taken the holy state of Matrimony upon
them, instituted by God in Paradise, shall forgetting the promise which they
sometimes made in the presence of God, in the face of the Congregation, and
confirmed by the Ceremonies of the Church, in a presumptuous boldness, or bold
presumption, dare to infringe and Conjugium ex duobus facit vaum.
Adulteriu^ ex vno facit duos.
Spieg.
untie that knot which God had knit together, by an unlawful Concubinage in
defiling of his neighbors bed, endeavoring as much as in him or her lies, to
induce a spurious generation. Incest is then said to be committed, when they
who by reason of consanguinitie and nearenes of blood are prohibited by the
Laws of God, and the holy Church, to join themselves in Matrimony one to
another, shall yet notwithstanding, carnally know each other. Fornication is
then said to be Committed, when a single man and woman, be she widow or virgin,
having not taken the state of Matrimony upon them, shall carnally know one
another. These are the differences of these several kinds of whoredom.


Rustic: I pray you, what are the Laws which punish those offenses?


Iurisp: They are comprehended under those titles, De adulterijs, de stupris,
incestu, de nuptijs and matrimonio, de divortijs, de sponsalibus, and the like.
And may well be said to be as are the precedent Laws, either Laws of
Commonition, or Laws of Animadversion.


Rustic* What are the Laws of Commonition?


Iurisp: They are Laws made against drunkenness, against pride in Cloths, or
excessive wearing of apparel, and against idle persons, who cannot properly
be said to live like reasonable men, but to subsist and have a being in the
world like the Vana (moriente Theoph:) querimonia de natura putatur, quod breve
sibi, diuturnum cervis and cornicibus vitae spatium dederit; cum non vivere sed
vita valere been est; vt fabula, sic vita, non quam diu, sed quam been acta sit
refert.
bruit sensitive Creatures, the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field:
Man was not borne to sit still and sleep, but like the Quae nobiliora, sunt
mobiliora; iniuemur corpora caelestia, elementa, quaeque ex ijs co^ponuntur, in
perpetuo motu, eoque velociora quo sunt perfectiora consistere. Ecquid fibi
voluit Plato cum homine^ plantam, non terrae infixam, and immobilem, sed
caelestem and radicibus inversam nuncupavit.
Sun in the Firmament, to be ever in motion; and like the little Emmot in the
Summer, to be ever working; and like the Trees and plants in the Spring, to be
ever growing.


Rustic: I pray you give me leave a little to expostulate with you concerning
these Laws of Commonition, as you call them: and first of the last which you
have named; How does idleness conduce to the breach of those Laws? and how
can a man sitting still and doing nothing, be said to be a transgressor of
those Laws?


Iurisp: The wanton Poet in his amorous verses will tell you in Aegistus.
Quaeritur, Aegistus quare sit factus adulter;
In promptu causa est, desidiosus erat. Ovid.
Whilst Venus is Courting of a looking glass, paynting and pruning of her
self, framing of her Countenance, speech, habit and gesture, to give
contentment, Cupid with his two Arrows, opportunity and importunity sets
upon her, and surpriseth her; whilst Diana stands by and is impregnable, Venus
entertaines him, and is Faemi^ae oculatae essa debent, and nunquam sine
supitione degere, nec facile cuiquam credere, quantumvis arridenti, vel

credulous, believes whatsoever he says to be Oracles, Courts him, kisseth
him, sports and plays with him, until she be enchanted with his Charms; and
why, because she cannot entertain the time otherwise: she was never bred to
paines-taking, nor knows what belongs to a Needle, Violl, Virginal, or Lute,
she can Court a looking glass, dress her self of the fashion, and knit a
true loves knot, and this is all that she can do, and is glad of any Company
that suits and sympathizeth with her Condition: but as for Diana, it is not so
with her, she entertaines him too, but it is to make sport with him; she knows
him to be a Verbalist, and so values him, esteeming his words as wind, and his
charms as the charms of Sirens, hears him only, because she cannot avoyde
him, yet keeps him at a distance, and will have no manner of dalliance with
him, but in his greatest importunity, puts him off with some merry conceit or
other, so keeps him to recreate her self withal, and to make sport, yet
keeps her self free from him, and why? because Diana is ever in employment,
she can do any thing that is fit for a Lady or Gentlewoman to do: she can
write and read, sing and play upon the Lute, Violl, and Virginal: Her Mos

daily exercise in the morning, is to offer up some praises and prayers to her
Creator, that being done, for that is ever her first work. Sometimes she takes
into her hands the sacred History, and by daily reading and ruminating thereon,
becomes so good a Textuary, that without troubling of her eyes, she will post
over any Epistle of the Apostles as readily as her Alphabet, nay, more
punctually point out in an instant with an intellectual instrument, the
strength of her memory only, any verse that can be named in any of those
Epistles, and so prettily when she was but a twig of eight or nine years
growth, that I ingenuously acknowledge, I have often cast away my money to
hear and see delights, which have not given me half so much contentment.
Sometimes she betakes her self unto the Courtly Castilio, well known to most
of the Christian Princes of the world, speaking unto them in their own
natural language, in English, Latin, Italian, and French (for so it is indeed
translated out of Italian into all those languages) and in her mother tongue;
informs her self how to choose a waiting Gentlewoman, and how a Qui vivit in
Curia debet cum tristibus severe, cum remissis jucunde, cum senibus graviter,

whisperings of undermining sycophants and flatterers. Sometimes again she
betakes her self to her Lute, Violl, or Virginal, and with her little fingers

Tythraeus, to reviue the most dull and drowsiest spirits. Sometimes she
betakes her self unto her Needle; and with that little instrument, attended
with a silk or silver train, draws out the picture of an Acorne or blossom,
as lively as Apelles could do with his pensill. Sometimes again she goes
into the Dairy, and converseth with the dairy-maide, and in a familiar manner
of discourse (so courteous she is and loving to the meanest) learnes of her the
mystery of her Art. Sometimes again into the Pastry, where she takes much
delight, and there either in raising of a Marchpane like unto a Pyramides, or
in ye pourtrayting out a Pheasant, Cock, or Partridge, she does a while
recreate her self: Sometimes she walks into the open air, to see that no
wrong be done to the seeds of her huswifery, her Hemp and Flax which is
growing without; from thence to her Bees, where she stays a while, beholding
profit come flying home unto her, the little Be bringing honey to the hive.
Sometimes again she walks into the meades and pastures, to see her horned
creatures, that do as duly as the day comes offer up the materials, wherewith
the husbandman and plowman is so much delighted, of Butter and Cheese, of Cruds
and cream, and if Cupid as she walks do come into her way, she will spend
some time with him too, and in exchange of a witty riddle or two put him to a
nonplus: but after the expense of an hour or two, she has enough of him; so

Client would live according to the Law, the Courts of Justice would have
little to do: if the Patient would live according to the Laws of nature, the

Cupid might put up his Arrows into his quiver, and seek him a new trade and
occupation; for so the Poet has long ago discovered. Otia si tollas periere

Gymnosophists, there was a Custom, that always before dinner the younger
people were to be examined how they had spent their time from the rising of the
Sun, and if they could give no good account of it, they were not to be
admitted to the Table: Among the Lacedaemonians, the Custom was, that every
tenth day the Ephabi were to be brought before the Ephori, the young men before
the Governors, and if that during those ten days, they had not improoved
themselves in the knowledge of some laudable thing, they were severely beaten
and chastised. Among the Athenia^s when they came to man's estate, they were
more severely dealt withal, and were put to death as thieves; for they held
idle drones to stand for ciphers, mere nothings, carcasses and dead men, which

removed would stink and putrify, and like a Contagion infect their
neighbors; which made the Poet in his Georgicks affirm, that there is no
better way to keep the pretty sweet Commonwealth in prosperity, than to
root out those degeneres apum reges, buzzing drones that make such a noise and
clamor, yet do no manner of good unto it, and which gave occasion to some of
the wisest men of the world in their generations to affirm, that there are two
sorts of people who dealt in extremes, which are burdensome to all
Commonwealths, the busy negotiator and undertaker, and the idle drone and
sluggard, the one composed of the two light Elements, fire and air, the other
of the two more gross, earth and water; the one so busy that he will have an
Oar in every man's boat, and a hand in every man's business, and so that he may
be doing and going, cares not almost what he does, nor whether he goes; being
one that consults little, but trots and travels much, and his legs for the most
part outrun his wits: the other so lazy, who though he has neither food for
his belly, nor clothes for his back, will rather steal and starve, than take
pains to get a living. The first of these, that is, the Vide fabulam de sue

giddie negotiator, Tacitus thus reproues, there have been, says he, diverse
hopeful men, like to have come to great preferment in the Commonwealth, who
despising that which with little patience might have been had with security,
have hastened to that, which being gotten before due time, has bred their
ruin and destruction. And Lonicerus.
Saint Martin thus in a Coachman, a Coachman travailing to Lutetia, now
called Paris, the prime City of France, in a full Carriere meeting with him,
expostulates with him, whether he might reach y^ night to Lutetia or no, to
whom Saint Martin answered, Si festines excluderis, sin lento passuincedas,
vrbem hoc vesperi ingredieris, if thou ridest not so fast thou may; which the
Coachman taking to heart, thinking the holy man had derided him, drives on as
fast as his horses could well go; but being not gone out of sight, one of the
wheels of his Coach broke, so that he was enforced to take up his lodging
there that night; the Coachman then remembered what the holy man had presaged,
and that if he had gone more easily, he had come sooner to his journeys end:
the other, that is, the idle drone and sluggard is thus reproved by Caesar in
Florus. Ego noto Florus esse,

And thus by the Sueton: in Caesare.
Citizens of Rome in Bibulus, Caesar and Bibulus being Consulls together, when
any thing happened wor^hy of note during the time of their Consulship, the
Citizens pleasantly in derision of Bibulus would say, that it was done when
Julius and Caesar were Consuls, making mention of his two names, as if they had
been several men, and never remembering of Bibulus, but as a Cipher or dead
letter. Non Bibulo quicquam nuper, sed Caesare factum,
Nam Bibulo fieri Consule nil memini.

dye on the Mountains, where honor is to be found, than live with Florus or
Bibulus in Tavernes and Taphouses. Caesar in dying gains immortality, but the
other in living perpetual shame and ignominy: the industrious man lives when
he is dead, but the idle man is dead whilst he lives. Nam qui nihil agit, esse
omnino non videtur, says the Orator. Of both these sorts, that is, both of the
industrious and sluggish people, the Laws derived out of this sacred Law take
special notice; and therefore as they do give due respect to such as live
according to their professions, by the sweat of their brows; So do they See
the Statute of 5. Elizab: cap. 5. Rast tit. laborers and servants.

brand idle persons with the Stigmaticall marks of shame and ignominy, as
incorrigible vagrants and unworthy members in a Commonwealth.


Rustic: But how can drunkenness be said to conduce to the breach of these
Laws?


Iurisp: Very well; and not unto these alone, but unto all other Laws derived
out of the sacred Laws of both Tables, as will be made to appear unto you.
And first that it does conduce unto adultery, fornication, and incest, I would
have you inform your self out of the Tragedy of Oedipus in Seneca, where you
may behold the fruits and effects of this nastie vice, set forth to the life:

from the Oracle, lay with his wife and begat Oedipus; this swolne-foote

natural mother, and of her begat two twins which killed each other, which
the poor distressed mother beholding, in very anguish of soul killed her
self: yet the Tragedy ended not there, for at the funeral of the two Twins
Eteocles and Polynices, which was performed by fire, the ashes of them divided
it self, the ashes of the one flying one way, and the ashes of the other
flying another way; so that as they lived all their life time in dissension, so
they dyed, and as they dyed, so the fruit thereof showed it self in the manner
of their funerals, and in their posterity; for as long as there was any of
their posterity remaining upon the face of the earth, they could never be
reconciled. This Tragedy moralized, will show unto you that from this root of
drunkenness proceed those stemmes and branches Inter decreta Eutichiani

drinking and whoring, and having run into debt further than his state would
satisfy, became an humble suitor to Alphonsus King of Arragon, that he would
be pleased to grant him a protection against his Creditors, that persecuted him
like a Ghost wheresoever he went; to whom Alphonsus answered, that he would
advise of it, and if he found upon inquiry, that he had spent his eestate,
either in his service, or for the benefit of his Country, or in relieving of
the fatherles and widows, then he would not only protect him, but relieve and
succor him; but if he found that he had spent it upon himself, and was able
to give no better an account of it, than the wastfull Steward did, who being
called upon to bring in his books of Account, In his own breast he thought it

His money to enclose;

men; but to drink vsque ad Crapulam, until we be as loathsome as a Sow, as

Laws of the one and the other; and chiefly because it delivers up the

of drunkenness was crept into his Country, thus bewayles the state of it: Nulla

find out a remedy for them; but this Contagion, no physic can cure: how is
our frugalitie turned into luxury? and how do we degenerate from our
forefathers, they with sweat and blood made us to be Lords of the earth? and
how are our spirits effeminated, to suffer that which they so dearly bought to
be taken from us? It is a Germane recreation, and I would to God they would

little discontinuance of acquaintance, would have been a mere stranger unto
them, so puffed were they in their faces, so swollen in their body, so gowtie in
their legs, so deformed in every part and member of their bodies? It has
been a question in the Schools, as those that are Academicks know, whether
Socrates (though sober and temperate) were idem numero in age as he was in

forth the deformity of this nastie vice.


Rustic: Sir, you have shot your sharpest Arrows at this abuse, but you might
as well have kept them in your Quiver, if you do not show us how we may
reform and redress it; for to discover abuses, and not to show how to
redress them, is to lay open a wound, and not to apply a remedy to it.


Iurisp: The Melius quidem vel salubrius remedium (vt inquit Serenissimus nuper

remedy is already prescribed, and if it were not, yet my intent is not to
take upon me the office of a Senator to reform abuses; that I leave to men of
riper judgeme^^, but to show you the deformity of the abuse, that so you may
avoyde both it and the Laws: for believe me Sir, I am of opinion in this case,
as Tiberius was in the like case, that -- Sint paucae leges;
Et valiant po^ius pondere quam numero.

multitude of Laws do little avail, and that in some Cases and at some times
the Laws may well be suffered to take their rest. The Aediles upon a time
complained, that the Laws concerning the excess of expenses was naught set
by, and the sumptuousness of mooveables, which was forbidden, daily increased,
and desired the Lords of the Senate to assist them in the reformation thereof;
the Lords not willing to meddle with the matter, referred the Consideration
thereof to Tiberius himself; Tiberius wisely considering how unseemly and
Fertur dixisse Tiberius, satius omittere quod assequi oequiret, quam tentare
turpiter quod postea non efficeret.

Tacit. lib. 3.
dishonorable it would be to undertake that which could not be effected, or if
it could, yet with the ignominy and infamy of many noble men: he sent his
Letters to the Senate to this purpose; it would be convenient my Lords
peradventure, that in other matters I should be demanded my opinion in your
presence, and speak what I thought behoouefull for the Commonwealth; but in
this I thought it were better to withdraw mine eyes, because it is not in my
power easily to redress it. If the Aediles had before asked my advice, I know
not whether I should rather have persuaded them to let pass strong and rooted
vices, than go so far that it should be known how unable we are to redress
some kind of abuses. If I should go about any such thing, I know not where to
begin. Shall I reduce to the ancient Custom your spacious Country-houses, the
number of your servitors, the quantity of silver and gold, your painted Tables
and Pictures of most curious workmanship, the superfluousnes of apparel both
in men and women, your precious stones, for which our money is transported to
foreign Nations? I am not ignorant that these things are blamed at public
meetings, and a mean wished for; but if any man would make it a Law to punish
them, those themselves that complain would exclaim that the ruin of the
Nobility is sought after, for that there are none free from this crime:
Sapienter dictu cujuscunque illud fuit,
Nec Veneris nec tu vini capia^is amore,
Vno namque modo Vina, Venusque nocent.

Wherefore the best means to redress a general evil is, that every one
would prescribe a Law to himself, and amend one: it was the wish of Tiberius
in his days, and I wish it with all my heart in our days.


Rustic: Sir, you have sufficiently showed how that odious vice of drunkenness
does conduce to the breach of those Laws, I pray you in the next place, show
how Cloths and Apparel does any way conduce unto it.


Iurisp: You must know, that decent apparel is Vestes nigellae and candidi

commended and commanded by the Laws of God and men; it is inordinate
apparel which is prohibited; when as we wear our Cloths not to cover our
nakedness, but to discover it, by dasling the eyes of silly people, with
glorious outsides. A misdemeanor, of which the Prophets, Apostles, and reverend
Fathers of the Church have taken special notice. Saint Peter in his 1 Pet. 3.

first Epistle gives us a special Caveat to abstain from intemperate wearing
of apparel; and the holy Fathers of the Church have in some indignation
arraigned the proud men of the world, and would needs know of them, why they
should so expensiuely lavish out in disbursing of so much money to so little
profit, in fading corruptible garments, and why they should be so proud of
those poor vanities, which being at the best are but borrowed out of the guts
of the earth, or of the silly silkeworme, and Vestis e peccato originem habet.

them. They ingenuously confess, they know no reason unless it be by such
glorious outsides to deceive the world, as did the Evam serpens decepit

garments they shall put on.


Rustic: Sir, I pray you give me leave to expostulate a little with you
concerning those Laws you now speak of: for it does concern us all: Is it
not lawful for a man to wear what Clothes he will?


Iurisp: No; it is not The statute of 24. H. 8. in grounded upon the Laws of
Arms. By the Laws of Arms a Prince may use powderings in his apparel as
thick as he pleases; a Duke in his mantell four ranges only, a Marquess
three and a half, an Earl three only.
lawful for Dukes and Marquisses to put themselves into the habits of Kings
and Princes; nor for Viscounts and Barons to Cloth themselves in an attire
belonging to Earls; nor for Gentlemen to wear such habits as are set apart
for Knights of the order, and men of their quality and degree; nor for yeomen,
husbandmen, and serving-men to attire themselves like unto Gentlemen; briefly,
it is not lawful for such as are sordidati, to put upon them the habit of
Candidati, nor for the Plebei to attire themselves in the habits of the
Patritij, nor for servi to go as do the ingenui: in a word, it is not lawful
for men of low degree to cloth themselves in the habit of men of high degree;
nor honorable for men of high degree to attire themselves like unto men of low
degree; but necessary it is that every man should wear a habit according to
his Forma habitus and vestitus apud veteres stricte observata fuit; nec inter

Rustic: What if a man do transgress in this kind; what danger does he
incur?


Iurisp: Besides the danger of the Laws, and the censure of the multitude, he
does incur the Censure of Caesar. Augustus Caesar upon a time seeing some
Roman Citizens clad in short fullyed cloaks called upon them with a loud
voice, Sueton: in Augusto Caesare.
Romanos rerum dominos gentemque togatam.
As if he should have said, ye Citizens which challenge to your selves a
prerogative to be the Lords of the world, and to be the long-robed Nation; how

the Country, and follow Convenient longae vestes qui publica tractant

scarred with some hag or hob-goblin; of what Nation, Religion, or what his name

the Religion there professed, and his name is Separatist, others say, he came out
of the clouds from Aristophanes City of Cuckoes, and is of the Religion there

fine Cloth as would make him a Gown, and sent it to his Tailor; I. Drake
seeing the Knights Cloth in the Tailors shop, liking it very well, bought as
much of the same, and gave direction to the Tailor to make it up in all points
like unto the Knights. The Knight being given to understand thereof, remembering
the old Proverb, Ne suitor vltra crepidam; commanded the Tailor to cut his
Cloth as full of holes as his sheares could do, and so to make it up, which
the Tailor did accordingly, and in like manner cut I. Drakes and made it up,
and brought it home to him, which when I beheld, he fell into a passion and
swear by his pantosles, that he had spoiled his Gown; Marry quoth the Tailor,
then blame your s^l^e for it, for I have made it according to the Knights in
all points as you commanded; Marry ( quoth To:) if ever I became of the

habits and attire.


Rustic: What Cloths may we wear, I pray you, to avoyde the Laws and the
Censure of the multitude?


Iurisp: Any Clothes that do not savor of irregularitie, of too much
baseness, or too much pomp and gorgeousness. For by the wearing of Cloths, a
man must not think to purchase any Cordato egregioque adolesce^t nihil turpius
est, quam in cute curanda plus aequo operari.

fame or renown: Munditiae mulieribus, labor viris convenit, Neatness and
cleanlines belongs to women, but the only glory and ornament to a man is
valor and magnanimity. Insana est ambitio fimum tegere purpura, and pallidum
cadaver in pheretro aureo pouere, nam quo plus ornatus, eo plus horroris habet,
says one of the wits of his time, the witty and sententious Petrarch was a man
of great accounts in Italy, his Ancestors were Florentines, and lived in
exile, but he returned home, and dyed in his own Country of an Apoplexy,
being seaventie years of age wanting but a day; he was buried at Arquato
Montanere, a village belonging unto Padua, where in honor of him a Sepulcher
of Marble was built, and an Epitaph of his own making inscribed, part whereof
is as follows. Frigida Francisci lapis hic tegit osla Petrarchae,
Fessusque interris, caeli requiescit in arce.

Orator and Poet Petrarch the Italian, it is a kind of madness to enamell
mud-walles with gold and silver. Put a stinking Carcass into a golden Coffin,
it smells never the less. Put what Clothes you will upon a Blackamore, you
shall never make him white, nay, the more rich you cloth him, the more deformed
you shall find him. For Contraries each other best descry,
Swart Crows seem blacker, when white Swans stand by.
Wherefore if my advise might pass for Current, I would have every true
Britain to put on the resolution of a true Roman; and to be like unto
Augustus, who thought it a dishonor and disparagement to himself and his
Country, to be beholding to his neighboring Countries for Clothes to put on
his back.


Rustic: I would to God I had given my Teeme of Horses and Oxen too, that there
were a Law made to tie us to wear our Country-Commodities, and none other; and
the old Law made in the days of King By the Stat. of 11. Edw. 3. Cloth made
out of the Realm was prohibited to be worn.

were put in execution, I am sure, it would be well for us if it were so. Our
Wools would not stick upon our hands as now they do; and I believe the
Citizens would not be sorry for it.


Iurisp: Sir, in my opinion, there should not need a Law in this Case if we
did affect our Countries as we should, every man's reason should be sufficient
to prevail with him. Why should any Englishman trouble himself or others to
send so far as Naples and Persia for silks to Cloth him, when as he may
furnish himself with materials more useful and necessary in his Dictum fuit

own Country? Why should he bestow hundreds in foreign parts to feed moths
and Cankars, when he may feed them at home a great deal better cheap?
Certainly, I know not, unless he will allow this Paradoxe to be a Principle,
That things far fet and dear bought are good for Englishmen. The Laws of
God and nature enjoyne us to love our Countries, and to prefer the useful
Commodities thereof before the superfluous Commodities of foreign Nations, the
Wool of sheep before the excrements of worms. If we lived near unto the
Torrid Zone, or in any hot Country, we might have some color to affect the
Commodities of Persia and Naples; but living in a Climate rather inclinable to
cold than heat, where if one quarter of the year prove hot, the rest is cold.
I know no reason for mine own part, wherefore we should so much affect to
wear those foreign light Commodities. If therefore we cannot be allured to
affect our Countries (which every good disposition naturally does, and
prefers the Commodities thereof before the Commodities of foreign Nations)
by any argument drawn ab vtili and Commodo. Yet let us be allured by arguments
drawn a necessario; yet being as great a Solaecisme for such as live in cold
Countries to put on light Clothes, as for such as live in hot Countries to
wear heavy garments.


Rustic: Sir, if you tell Socrates or Seneca, that they ought to prefer their
Countries; the one of them will tell you, that he is Mundanus, that the whole
world is his Country: and the In quam cunque terram venio, (inquit Seneca) in
meam venio. Patria est, vbicunque est been; illud autem per quod been est; est
in homine, non in loco.
other, that that is his Country where he fares best, and has best
entertainment, and that it is not for Libera men's quae per orbem naviter
vagandi facultatem habet ad vnum angulum, vel angustum vnius Civitatis, aut
provinciolae gyrum terminari nolit.
noble spirits to be chayned and wedded to any one corner of the earth, as to
neglect the other parts of it, having an interest in the whole; it is for
snayles that want legs to walk and wings to fly, for bondmen and slaves that
are debarted of liberty to be tied to places, but for Eagles and free men that
have the world at will, to take benefit of the whole. If the foggie vapors of
the Islands offend them, to fly into the Countries more constant and settled:
and if the heat near unto the line offend them, to betake themselves unto
more temperate Climates.


Iurisp: O but I would tell them again, that Necessity forces every wight,
To love his Country with all his might.
I mean that Country wherein he drew his first breath, where he trod his first
steps, where he received his education, which fashioned his mind, and gave him
a well-being in the world, where his lands and revenewes lie, and where his
friends and acquaintance are bound up fast together in the bonds of
consanguinitie and affinity, and I would send them to no other Schoolemaister
than to the dumb Creatures to be instructed herein: the Naturalists do
observe, that the Hare when she is hunt will hasten to the place where she was
bred, to take her last farewell; that the Fox though he prey abroad, yet will
kennell at home; that the fowls of the air and fishes of the Sea by an
instinct of nature, are so taken with the places where they were bred, that
they will never depart far from them. So that God and nature enjoynes every
one to love the Countries and the Commodities thereof, where they are governed
by good and wholesome Laws, and enjoy their possessions in safety before
other foreign Countries and Commodities; of whose Laws they receive no
benefit.


Rustic: O but if a man suite himself with such Commodities only as his own
Country can afford him, no man will set by him, or regard him, whereas if he be
clad in silks and velvets and the rich Commodities of other Nations, every man
will honor him, as the Cyprus apud Xenoph splendidissimo amictu describitur,
et ob eum apparatum obstupefactos Persas caepifle ipsum adorare, cum antehac
adorafset nemo.

Xenoph: lib. 8. Cyrop:
Persians did Cyrus, when they beheld him in all his bravery.


Iurisp: Truly amongst wise men Clothes make no difference, if they savor not
of irregularitie. Marry glittering shows do oftentimes dasle the eyes of
silly women, and sometimes also of silly and simple men; whose wits have not an
edge to pierce any further than the outside only, but Solon will discover
Croesus to be Croesus, let him put on what Nemo ex istis quos purpuratos vides

habit he will, and a wise man will know an Ass to be an Ass by his neighing,
though he be clad in a Lions or a Foxes skin. It was an apt answer which
Solon once gave Croesus, when Croesus had put himself into a gorgeous habit
and attire, and would needs know of him whether ever he saw a more beautiful
sight in all his life; told him that he had seen the Peacocke, that went more
gorgeously on the week days, than he did on the holy days. It was a pretty
passage likewise which happened between the poor man and the proud man in the
Dialogue. A Glorioso vaunting of his painted Clothes that they were not like
other men's, but of a new fashion and different Cut unto them, which the poor
man hearing, thinking he had been out of his wits, took heart unto himself,
and was so bold as to tell him, that better men were content to wear worse
Clothes, and that worse Clothes would better become him; they being neither fit
for him, nor he for them; and that he did much marvel, that he being but a
servant should not content himself to wear such Clothes as his own Country
could afford him, but should trouble the Tu fortassis aliorum servus
disjunctissimas fatigas gentes, tibi nent, tibi pectu^t, tibi nexunt Belga,
tibi Persae: Augusto cunctorum domino, aut vxor et filia sororque cum neptibus.

Petrarch.
Belgians, the Persians to spinne, card, and weave, to make him a garment,
which was neither civil, nor manly, nor beseeming a Roman, but effeminate,
profuse, and ridiculous. When as the great Augustus, that was Lord of all,
could be well content to wear home-made Clothes, such as his own family, his
wife, his daughter, his sister, and neeces did provide for him. Such respect,
as this Glorioso drew unto himself, do painted Clothes and gorgeous outsides
draw unto a man, making him indeed to be hated and contemned. I would
therefore have every true Britain, I say it again and again, to put on the
resolution of a true Roman, and to be like Augustus, whom I find in the
Catalogue of the most renowned Princes, Sueton: in Augusto.

Petrarch.
Qui vest non alia quam domestica vsus est.


Rustic: I hope you will allow the gallant Courtly Ladies, and the lusty
Country Lasses, that have not disposed of their Virginities, to set forth
themselves in the richest Ornaments and attire that money can buy.


Iurisp: Quae pura sunt nuda videri amant, mos est faeda coloribus abdere;
virtue never appears more beautiful than when she presents her self naked
unto us. It is the condition of vice to cloth her self in colors to cover her
deformity. Certainly, the Ladies of the Court, and the Lasses of the
Country, can no way better set forth themselves, than by putting upon them the
habits of Peregrini odores, atque omne artificium been olendi sunt signa
defectuum; sed bonae famae odor bonus, latiusque sensibilis, quam aromatum, si

modesty and civilitie. These will make them glitter like the stars in the
Firmament; smell like the gardens of Adonis and Alcinous, and draw the
affections of Suitors and affectionate followers unto them more powerfully, than

Outward ornaments of Cloth of silver and tissue, of silks and velvets, of
jewels and precious stones, are common as well to the bad as to the good, to
whores as to chaste Matrons and Virgins: but these alone are impropriated to
virtue and goodness. Yet I will acquaint you with a Custom which the old
Romans used; the Romans were used during the minority of their children, to
make little difference between their sons and their servants, their
daughters and their hand-maides, by clothing and attyring them, that time they
set apart for the beautifying and adorning of their minds in all kind of
literature, and did conceive to pranke them up in Vestitus insignis superbiae
vexillum nidusque luxuriae.

Petrarch.
Clothes, would be a means to withdraw their affections from those things,
which in future times would do them more good; and therefore until the time
they intended to bestow them in marriage, they kept them in a kind of
servitude, but then as Flora in her prime, as the Sun at the highest, or the
Moon in her complement did they set them forth; so that every child took
notice by the sudden alteration of their habits, what their parents did
intend toward them: and so Suitors as to a fair and market repaired unto them.
Which custom of theirs I commend as a most laudable custom, but for such as
are already preferred, to lavish out in Clothes beyond their degrees and
estates, and to no other end, than to steal away the affections of husbands
from their wives, or of wives from their husbands, that I utterly condemn and
disallow.


Rustic: Sir, you have sufficiently showed how idleness, drunkenness, and the
inordinate wearing of apparel do conduce to the breach of the Laws derived
out of the sacred Law; and what the Laws of Commonition are which do punish
the same by way of prevention. I pray you in the next place show what the Laws
are which do punish Adultery when it is committed, and what punishments the
Laws have provided for the same.


Iurisp: The Laws that punish Adultery, are Laws of Anineadversion; which (as
the Laws of Commonition do punish only ad Castigationem, that the delinquent
himself may be stayed and stopped in his unruly courses,) so these do punish
ad ruinam; that others seeing the punishments may be deterred from committing
the like offenses.


Rustic: What are the punishments which the Laws inflict upon offenders in
this kind?


Iurisp: By the Law of God the punishment was no less than death; the Levit.
20. v. 10.
Adulterer and Adulteress shall dye the death. If you look into the sacred
Scripture, you may there behold that for the transgression of one man in this
kind, a whole Tribe has suffered; for the transgression of many, whole Cities
have suffered; for the transgression of the multitude, the whole world has
suffered. If you read but the story of Genesis 34.
Sichem and Dina, you shall there see how that for the transgression of Sichem,
all the Sichemites suffered; how the Judge. 19.
Benjamites suffered for ye abuse offered to the Levites wife: how David for
Vrias wife; how Pharaoh for Abraham's wife; how Sampson for Dalila. If you look
into the story of Sodom and Gomorrha, you may there behold how that this
transgression was a principal cause of the ruin and destruction of those
famous flourishing Cities. If you look into the Tragedy of Troas, you shall
there behold the punishment due to this transgression lively set forth by
Seneca in the beginning of the Tragedy in Hecuba, where she bewayling the
incertaintie and mutabilitie of all worldly pomp and pleasure, wishes all
such as place their felicity in it, to make her and the City of Troy their
objects and looking glasses. Seneca in Troad. initio.
Quicunque regno fidit,
Et magna potens dominatur aula,
Me videat, and te Troja.
Who so in pomp of proud estate,
Or Kingdom sets delight;
Or who that joys in Princes Court,
To bear the sway of might.
Ne dread the fates, which from above
The mighty God downe-flings;
But fast affiance fixed has,
In frail and fickle things.
Let him in me both see the face
Of Fortunes flattering joy,
And eke respect the ruthful end,
Of thee O ruinous Troy.
Senec. in Troad. If you look into the History of the Genesis 6. and 7. Heu tanta
impietas toto grassatur in orb,
Vt submersa deus cuncta animata velit!

old world, you shall there see that this transgression was a principal pioner
to undermine the earth, and to open the sluices to let in the deluge upon it. So
odious has this transgression been in the sight of God, and such sharp and
severe punishments has God ever inflicted upon transgressors in this kind.


Rustic: What Canonical Laws have been made to punish this transgression;
and how did the Jews and the Heathen people punish the same, I pray you
acquaint me.


Iurid: You shall understand, that by the ancient Canons of the Church, that
he or she that was convicted of Adultery, was to do penance for the space of
seven years, before he could receive a plenary absolution. By the peculiar
Canonical Laws of this Nation wherein you live, if a Minister had been
convicted of Adultery, all his goods were presently to Reformat. legum
Ecclesiast: de adulterijs et divortjis. Cap. 2.
devolve unto his wife and children, if so be he had any; if not, to such good
uses as the Judge in his discretion should think fit; and if he had been
formerly promoted to any Benefice, to have been deprived, and to have been
made incapable ever after to have enjoyed any other; and to have been banished,
or otherwise to have suffered perpetual imprisonment; if she had been a wife
that had thus transgressed, she was to loose her dowry, and all the fortune she
could expect from her husband, and either to be banished, or to suffer
perpetual imprisonment. The fundamental Laws of our Nation take no notice of
these offenses, but leaves the punishment thereof wholly to the Ecclesiastical
Judges; but if the Adultery be enforced, then do our Laws not only punish
the malefactors, but their Equus ejus dedecorabitur, cauda ejus abscissa, canis
leporarius, vel alius eodem modo dedecorabitur, si habet accipitrem, perdat
beccam, vngues, et caudam.

Bract. lib. 2.
dumb Creatures, their Horses, Hawks, and dogs, by disfiguring of them, that
every man may take notice by looking upon them, of what condition their
Masters are; which Laws continued in force until about the time of King Edw.
the 1. who by the Statute of Westminster. 1. cap. 13.
Westminster. the 1. mitigated the rigor of those Laws, making this offense to be
but a trespass; but afterward finding some inconveniences to arise, by reason
of this mitigatio^ by the statute of Westminster. 2.38.
West. the 2o. he caused this offense to be made felony again. So strict the
Statute and fundamental Laws of the Kingdom wherein we live been against
enforced Adulteries. By the Laws of the Jews the punishment was death, or a
Bundorf. de Synagoga Iudaica. cap. 34.
punishment as grievous. If the offense had been committed in the Summer time,
they were to undergo the Ant-penance, which was to sit for a certain season
in an Ant-hill, his ears and nose being stopped: if in the Winter time, then
they were enjoined the Water-penance, to sit up to the chin in cold water for a
certain season. Which kind of punishment it is said that Adam underwent in
Medeasch for eating of the forbidden fruit: if the season were neither hot nor
cold, then a certain kind of fasting was enjoined for the present, and when
Winter or Summer which first approached came, then they were to undergo the
Ant or Water-penance. By the Laws of the Heathens the punishment was
different, according to the diversity of Nations. In Tiraquill: in Alexand: ab
Alexand.
Tenedos the punishment was that the delinquents of both sexes should be
beheaded: in Iudaea they were stoned. Among the old Germans the punishment of
the Adulteress was first to have her hair cut off and to be banished from her
husbands house, and afterward to be whipped naked throughout every street of the
Town. Amongst the Pysadas, they were carried upon an Ass, their head toward
the Asses tail. Among the Existimabant Aegyptij mulierem sese ad illicita^
co^tinentia^ exornantem, oportere ea part mutilari, qua facies maxim
exornatur.

Diod. Sic: lib. 1. rerum antiq.
Egyptians, the woman had her nose cut off, and the man his privy members:
which Law was put in execution by the Romans and the Graecians. Carbo among
the Romans was bereaved of his privy members, because he willingly and
wilfully mistook his mark, and Dydimos the Fiddler among the Graecians was
hanged up by that Instrument in which he took most pleasure. Among the
Locrenses, Zele^cus made a Law, that he which committed this offense, should
forfeit both his eyes; which he executed so strictly, that to satisfy the Law,
his son being found guilty thereof, he caused one of his own eyes to be put
out. Among the Parthians, no offense was punished with greater severitie. Among
the Arabians, it was Capital. By the Law of Opilius Macrinus, they were burnt
that committed this offense. And certainly, if the man taken in the very act
of Adultery, had been bereaved of his privy members, it had been good
Justice by the Laws of the Graecians and Romans. The Case stood thus, one
being taken abed with his neighbors wife, the husband coming in, and finding
them abed together, without making any uproar, cut off the nose of the
Adulterer; and so suffered him to depart; this man walking abroad with his nose
in his hand, seeing every man to deride him, that knew upon what terms he lost
it: at the first was much dejected, but afterward putting on as good a face as
a man without a nose could do, gave out how Don Diago being drunk and stark
mad, with foolish jealousy had assaulted him, and taking advantage of his
nakedness, being unarmed, had surprised him and disfigured his face upon a
false ground, that he had been too familiar with his wife: which begat a
suite, and coming to hearing, the judgment was against the nose-cutter, for
that it was not lawful for a private man to do which a public Magistrate
could not: the Quis tibi persuasit nares abscindere maecho?
Non hac peccatum est part (marite) tibi.
Martial. lib. 3. Epig. 84.
nose never offended, and therefore to punish it was to punish the innocent;
but had he served him as Carbo was by the Laws of the Romans, he might have
justified it. So strict were the Laws even of the Heathens against Adultery.


Rustic: I pray you give me leave to expostulate a little with you, seeing that
Adultery and Fornication are things so odious and abominable in the eye of all
Laws, and marriage so honorable, to what purpose were the Julian Laws made,
which did prohibit men after sixty, and women after fifty years of age to
marry.


Iurid: To no purpose at all, and therefore they were repealed by Justinians
Laws; for generally the end wherefore marriage was prohibited was procreation
of children, which did occasion covetousness, and to prohibit that in men of
those years was but to prohibit that which the Laws of nature had prohibited
before. Chastity was ever held an honorable and commendable virtue amongst
the Heathens, yet such a Chastity as was voluntary and not compulsarie. Porcia
had never been recorded amongst the Romans for a chaste woman, had there been a
Law to have restrained her not to have married, nor the daughter of Marcus Cato
for her discreet Answers, who being moved again and again to marriage,
answered no, I know not how to better my self, for if I meet with as good a
one as I had before, I shall fear to loose him as I did him; if with a worse,
the world will condemn me that I could not content my self when I was well:
neither would the memories of Valeria solebat dicere sibi semper maritum suum
vivere: and Artemisia quod defunctum virum sicut vivu^ adamabat.
Valeria and Artemisia have continued so long, had not the love they bore to
their former husbands, and not the Laws restrained them from taking other
husbands unto them. So that without doubt those Laws were made to little or no
purpose at all.


Rustic: To what purpose then were the Laws made which did prohibit second
marriages, upon a penalty that women should forfeite whatsoever they had by

Iurid: Certainly, there were never any Laws made to punish marriages

duly celebrated and solemnized; but the Laws you speak of were made to
punish too too speedy marriages, that is, if the woman had married within the
year after her husbands death, which in Olim tenebatur mulier lugere virum per
spatium 10 menfium; tempus hodie est annus.
ancient time was set apart for mourning and lamentation, and not for mirth
and marriages; which Laws were therefore made to restrain the unbridled lusts
and affections of such immodest women as I shall acquaint you with. There lived
sometimes in Vtopia a certain woman, who so much lamented her husbands death
as if she would have dyed with Thisbe loved Pyramus so fervently that with the
same sword that he slew himself for love of her, she killed her self for love
of him, and dyed upon his Corpse.
Thisbe upon his Corpse, who attending him to his grave in a mournful manner,
sounded out nothing else but I would to God I might lie with thee, I would to
God I might lie with thee; but it so happened that this Mulieri ne credas ne
mortuae quidem.

Horat.
woman that made such a show of lamentation, within very few days after
married her self to a servant of hers, that led her by the arm to see her
husband interred; so that by the sequel the people gathered that her meaning
was yt she might lie with him that led her, and not with her husband in the
grave; which being noysed abroad, she became a scorn even to the children, so
long as she continued in Vtopia. So that I say, that marriages duly executed
were never punishable, but too too speedy marriages, such as this was.


Rustic: To what purpose likewise (if marriage be honorable among all men) were
the Laws made that restrained decrepit, aged and impotent people from marrying
with young wives?


Iurisp: Certainly, I never re^d of any such Laws, and indeed there needs
none, for such marriages are of themselves sufficient punishments unto them, as
appears by the marriage of See the Marchants-tale.

January and May in the English-Poet. Old Father January having past the heat
of youth in a single life, in his decrepit old age doted upon a wife, and none
would serve his turn but a Virgin of fifteen; and why, marry because (to use
the Poets language) A young thing a man may gye,
Right as man may warm Wax with hands plye.
And according to his desire it so happened, that he met with the young Lady
Discipulis quod virga, novis est Virgo maritis: Virga solet pucros, virgo
domare vitos.
May, whom he made his wife; but see what befell him. Not long after the
marriage was solemnized, Balnea vina venus, ventus piper, allia, fumus,
Ista nocent oculis, sed vigilare magis.
See more of this in the tragical History of Sypontus and Victorina; Where is
showed how disp^rity in years ^lome maks true harmony in affections, and how
difficult ^his f^r youth and age to sympathize, and that then it due eternal
praise and commendation, when January and May live like Venus and Adonis.


Venus (as she is a professed enemy to the eyes) deprived him of his sight, and
then as old men naturally use to do, he began to grow peevish, jealous, and
suspicious, and to Conjure his young wife, as she desired to have glory in
heaven, honor on earth, and to enjoy his possessions, to be true unto him: but
notwithstanding she made this protestation. I pray God that never daw the day,
That I ne starve as foul as woman may,
If ever I do my kin that shame;
Or else that I impair so my name.
That I be false, and if I do that lack
Do strip me, and put me in a sack;
And in the next River do me drench,
I am a Gentlewoman and no wench.
Notwithstanding, I say, she made this protestation, yet she suffered Damian
her servant, Damian in whom January reposed his greatest confidence, to defile
his bed: So that (I say) such marriages are sufficient punishments in
themselves, and need no Laws to restrain them.


Rustic: Sir, I am ^^re there are Laws that restrain Clergymen from
marriage, to what purpose were they made (I pray you) if marriage be Honorabile
conjugium inter omnes 13. Heb. 4. neminem excludit qui dicit omnes.

Zanch.
honorable amongst all, and Adultery and Fornication abominable?


Iurisp: You must know, that at such times as those canonical Laws were made,
the Pope sat in the chair and swayed all, profit and commodity was the end
and scope of all, and Hospitality and relief of the poor were clokes and
pretenses to bring to pass and to effect all. For under those goodly pretenses
of Hospitality and relief of the poor, diverse Councels were swayed to
restrain marriage in the Clergy, being alleged that wife and children must
needs occasion covetousness in them, and draw that relief to individualls
which did belong to the multitude: whereas if they were restrained they could
not be so ungrateful, but either in life or death to remember the poor, and
the Church from whose breasts they had sucked whatsoever they had. These were
fair pretenses, and made a glorious show in the Council of Nice, until old
Socrates Schol: lib. 1. cap. 8. Zosom. lib. 1. cap. 22^*
Paphnutius stood up and showed the inconveniences which ensued by reason of
this restraint, maintaining this position, Conjugall Matrimony to be true
Chastity, with such reasons and authorities, that he drew the whole Council
unto him; and these pretenses prevailed much with Gregory the great, until
that he was truly informed, how that at one time there were found in a

incestuous persons, occasioned principally, as it was thought, by reason of
this restraint, for being prohibited the ordinary means, they fell to
extraordinary, and so from one sin to another, from whoredom to murder.


Rustic: If such inconveniences arise by reason of restraining of men from
marriage, it were more needful in my opinion, that the old Law of the Romans
of Tacitus lib. 3. cap. 5.
Papia or Poppaea, which prohibited single life, and provided, that if any
should abstain from marriage and die without issue, the people should inherit
his goods, should be set afoote again.


Iurisp: Without doubt if it were, there would not be so much uncleanness, and
so many exorbitant offenses committed as now adays there is in the world:
neither should we so often as we do, fall from one sin to another, from
whoredom to murder. The Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata.

Singers in the Poet could hardly be drawn to sing at any time by their best
friends, until there was a Law that did command them to hold their peace, but
then their best friends could hardly make them to be silent. The strictest sect
of men are men, and subject to the infirmities of men, and for them to be
restrained from the means which the Law of God and nature does allow to all
Creatures, it cannot but go near unto them. If a woman, a woman? no, but a
monster in the shape of a woman, shall very oftentimes (the more the pity) to
avoyde shame and ignominy only, lay violent hands upon the fruit of her own
womb, and send it to his grave by untimely death, what can be expected from

death for such an offense?


Rustic: Sir, I am of your opinion, that if the Law you speak of were set on
foot, so many murders would not be committed, but I verily persuade my self
that covetousness would more abound.


Iurisp: No certainly; for in whatsoever condition or state of life the
Blackamore lives in, he will never change his hew; to a covetous disposition
it is all one whether he has wife or no wife, child or no child, he will be
covetous still; give Alexander the world, yet he will desire more worlds. The
Kingdom of Greece will scant content Agamemnon, when as Ulysses Ithacam suam

little is enough, but to the covetous nothing. Do we not see some in the
midst of plenty, live in penury discontentedly, and to be ready to put an end

that he would receive all Newyeares gifts thankfully, and then and not before
did he wallow in his heaps of gold and silver. But had his daughter never
been borne, he would have adopted twenty rather than his Coffers should have
been empty. So that it is not the state and condition of life we live in,
that can moderate our affections, and make them either covetous or abstemious,
but it is grace infused in the divine part must do the deed.


Rustic: Sir, give me leave, I pray you, to ask you one question more, and so
I will forbear to trouble you any further touching the Laws of Adultery. What
is the reason wherefore by the Laws of GOD the punishment due to the Adulterer
and Adulteress is death, and by the Canonical Laws but pecuniary and
corporal, which manner of punishment as I conceive, does in no degree suite
with the nature of the offense? for I ingenuously confess, I should sooner
pardon any one that should take away my Horse, my Ox, or my Plowe, nay, my
Horse, Ox, Plowe, and all, though they conduce much to my livelihood, than
that they should dismember me, take away one Maritus and vxor vnum sunt, vna
caro and vna anima, ideoque tenetur apud Iurisco^sultos, quod maritus potest

half of my self, my wife from me. Yet we see continually at our grand
Assizes and Sessions in the Country, how severely the Statute and fundamental
Laws of the Kingdom of England punish the one, and how slightly the
Canonical Laws punish the other.


Iurisp: Sir, you must know, that the Laws of God were as well Ceremoniales
and fore^ses leges Mosaitae, quae tantum Iudaico populo vsque ad Christum, and
ad certum tempus, donec mansura esset politia Iudaica constitutae, cum ea
politia magna ex part extinctae.
Ceremonial and Judicial as Moral, and that as the Moral Laws were to
continue for ever, so the other Laws were but Temporary and Arbitrary and
might be abrogated. Now as the Laws which prohibit the fact of Adultery were
Moral and inchangeble, so the Laws which provided punishments against the
Transgressors were temporary. In the Commonwealth of the Jews this sin
began to spread in self and to grow notorious, and therefore necessary was it,
that the Law should shoot sharp and keen Arrows at it. But the Jewish
Commonwealth being long since abolisht, the Laws of God have left the
punishments to temporal Princes, or to their subordinate Magistrates and
Ministers to punish the same, as they in their discretion shall think fit. So
that although in the Jewish Commonwealth, Adultery was thought worthy of
death, yet in other Commonwealths in after ages, pecuniary and corporal
punishment was thought to be a punishment equivalent to the nature of the
offense, yet this kind of punishment is not a punishment so slightly to be
esteemed of as you would have it: you may know, that Cain suffered more in his
life than in his death; the Serpents, Toades, and Adders live, but they are
continual eye-sores to the beholders; Cain would have dyed, for that his
torment was greater than he was well able to bear, but he could not, a mark
was set upon him, and a penal Law made which did inflict a punishment upon any
one that should ease him of his torment; so that a man may live and Veteres
Aegyptij ignominiam morte graviote^ esse putabant; ideoque in bellis qui
ordinem reliquissent, aut non paruissent ducibus, non morte plectebantur sed
maxima ignominia.

Diod: Sic. Non ego quos rapuit mors defleo; defleo vivos,
Quos vrunt longo fata futura metu.
Morus.
suffer more than if he had dyed for the same offense: the good name and
reputation of a man whilst he walks upon the face of the earth is like the
soul in the body the life of man. When it departs from him, he may well be
said to be a dead man; the Laws Ecclesiastical do punish these offenders by
this kind of death, by taking away their reputations from them, burying them
alive in the face of the Congregation, with their winding-sheets about them,
displaying to the world in notorious Ensigns engraven in great Letters, what
manner of persons they are, to the intent that they that behold their
punishments may avoyde their offenses, and that they may be an ignominy and
scandal to all posterity. So that you may know, the punishment is parallel
in some degree to the nature of the offense.


Rustic: You have given me good satisfaction, I pray you go on, and in the
next place acquaint me what are the Laws which are derived out of the next Law
of the second Table.


Iurisp: I will therein satisfy you. And first I will show you from whence
Furtum, the word Theft has its denomination; then how many Furti nomine been

kinds of theft there are; then who are properly said to be Thieves, and who
improperly; then what the Laws are which are hence derived, which punish
delinquents of both kinds; and lastly, what punishments those Laws inflict
upon delinquents and transgressors. You shall understand, that some will have
the word Spieg.
Furtum to take denomination a furno, from blacknes and darkness, because it is
usually committed closely and secretly, and the night is made the vale to cover
their unlawful practices and designs; others a fraud and ferendo, vel
auferendo, which I do conceive to be the most proper Etymology of it, being
that it does more fully express the nature of it. Theft being nothing else but
an unlawful taking away of that which belongs to another man, be it by force
or fraud, or by any other unlawful means whatsoever. The diverse kinds
whereof are well distinguished by furtum magnum and parvum, Larcenie and petit
Larcenie. Larcenie being then said to be committed by the Fulbeck.
Imperial Laws, when the thing feloniously taken away, amounts to the value
of 5.s. and by the Laws of See the Stat. of Westminster. 1. cap. 15. tit. Mainprise.
England, when it amounts to the value of xij. d. Petit Larcenie when the thing
stolen amounts not unto those values, the delinquents are distinguished either
by open and known, or secret thieves; open and known thieves are such who
make wrong and robbery their profession, and those are of diverse kinds, either
such as make the highways the places of their Commerce, and are commonly
known by the name of highway Thieves and Robbers; or such as make the fields
the places of their Commerce, whom the Imperial Laws term Abigei dicuntur
qui pecudes ex agris alienis abducunt.
Abigei and Drovers of Cattle, who use or rather abuse the driving trade,
interessing themselves in things which they never paid for; and unto which they
have no manner of title but possession, as horse-stealers, sheep-stealers, and
the like; or otherwise such as deal more closely, making private houses the
places of their commerce, such as are Burglarers, breakers of houses,
picklockes, and the like; and generally all such as take any thing from any man
to the values beforementioned surreptitiously and feloniously; Clandestini
sures viliores et sane improbiores sunt illis qui vi rapiunt: hi enim fraud
agunt, illi autem vi, and ideo juxta sententiam Ciceron: hi vulpeculis, illi
leonibus assimilantur.

secret thieves or enemies more dangerous than the former, are Church-robbers,
Usurers, Monopolizers, Enclosers, Engrossers, Regrators, and Forestallers,
corrupt and ill affected Justices, Advocates, Atturneys, double-dealing
Vnder-Sheriffes, and Mechanickes, which use fraud and deceit in the execution
of their Trades and Occupations.


Rustic: Of these latter I have often heard, but I never knew them to be
enemies so dangerous before. I pray you therefore acquaint me how I may know
them, that when I meet with them I may beware of them.


Iurid: Sir, to give you satisfaction, I will acquaint you with some privy
marks, and deliver unto you some rude and impolisht pictures of them, drawn
out though not to the life, in that deformity as they themselves are, yet
deformed enough, so that by looking upon the dead you may know the living, and
by knowing of them avoyde them. And first I will deliver unto you the picture
of the Church-robber. The Church-robber is a kind of pioner that undermines
the Academies, and by his magical spells and enchauntments pulls down
Churches and Steeples, yet never comes near them; that roots out learning and
Civilitie, and induces Barbarism into a Commonwealth, that withholds the
wages from the labourer, and takes away the Panis pauperum est vita eorum.

and the long and tedious voyage to the Indies to be short and momentary; it is
preferment that makes the Father strain himself to train up his son at the
Academie, and the son again to spend many a wearisome hour in musing and
meditating. The ready way therefore to disanimate the Soldier from the field,
to expel and banish the Tradesman and Artificer from the City, to pull down
Colleges, Churches, Academies, is to make an absolute separation and divorce
between industry and reward; and to damme up the way between learning and
preferment. This Julian the Apostata, the great Church-robber, and Arch-enemy
to God and all goodness put in execution; he fell not upon the Priests and
slew them, for he knew the next age would produce more; but under pretense to
set them in a ready way to heaven, he fell upon the Priesthood, and took away
all the rents and revenewes of the Church, making use of the words of the
Evangelist to serve his turn, Redditus Ecclesiae furripuit ne possint ali

you may have a more perfect knowledge of him, you may be pleased to take notice
that this is the man that sets up a Trade that robs the Commonwealth of those
mutual offices of love and familiarity which should be between man and man.
The Evangelist gave this in charge long ago Luke 6. verse. 35.
Mutnum date nihil indesperantes, lend freely, looking for nothing again. And
it was a Custom amongst Christians freely to relieve their brethren in their
wants and necessities; but the Evangelists Charge is wholly neglected, and the
Custom in use among the ancient Christians now quite and clean abolisht, by
the bringing in of that old Jewish trade of Usury. And now it is become a
Custom rather to lend to a Jew, a Turk, or any man for profit and commodity,
than to a friend, yea, the nearest of friends, though in want and necessity.
So that this greedy desire of having hatch out of this Jewish trade, has
been an eyesore in all ages of the world; and the wisdom of all times has
shot sharp Arrows at it, to banish it, especially the Jewish part of it, as
one of the greatest enemies of humane society, yet have allowed of it as the

Laws which do allow of it by way of restraint, and not otherwise do
condemn it as a thing odious and detestable both before God and man. The
Statute of the third year of King Henry the seventh begins thus; that all
unlawful Chevisances and Usury be damned, and none to be used upon pain of
forfeiture of the value of the money so Chevised and lent, and so goes on; the
Statute of the thirty-seaventh year of King Henry the eight begins thus;
where diverse Acts of Parliaments have been made for the avoiding and punishing
of Usury, being a thing unlawful, etc. The Stat. of the fifth year of King
Edward the sixth is verbatim as follows; where in the thirty-seaventh year
of the late King Henry the eight, amongst other Acts and Statutes then made, it
was enacted by authority of Parliament, that no person or persons at any time
after the last day of January in the said thirty-seaventh year, should have,
receive, accept, or take in lucre or gains for the loan, forbearing or giving
day of payment for any sum or sums of money for one whole year above the
sum often pound in the hundred, and so after that rate and not above of and
for a more or less sum, or for longer or shorter time, upon the pains and
forfeitures in the said Act mentioned and contained, the which act was not
meant or intended for the maintenance or allowance of usury, as diverse persons
blinded with inordinate love of themselves, have and yet do mistake the same;
but rather was made and intended against all sorts and kinds of Usury, as a
thing unlawful, as by the title and preamble of the said Act it does appear.
And yet nevertheless, the same was by the said Act permitted, for the avoiding
of a more evil and inconvenience that before that time was used and exercised.
But for as much as Usury is by the word of God utterly prohibited, as a Iure
optimo (inquit Arist.) in hominu^ odia incurrit faeneratio, quoniam ipsa
pecunia fructus ejus est; nec ad permutandas res, cujus causa comparata est

vice most odious and detestable, as in diverse places of holy Scripture is
evident to be seen; which thing by no godly teachings and persuasions can
sink into the hearts of diverse greedy, uncharitable, and covetous persons of
this Realm; nor yet by any terrible threatenings of Gods wrath and vengeance
that justly hangs over this Realm, for the great and open Usury therein
daily used and practiced; they will not forsake their filthy gain and lucre,
unless some temporal punishment be provided and ordained in that behalf. For
reformation thereof be it enacted by authority of this present Parliament,
that from the first day of May, which shall be in the year of our Lord God
1552. the said Act and Statute concerning only usury, lucre or gain of or for
the loan, forbearing or giving days of any sum or sums of money, be
utterly abrogated and repealed. And furthermore, be it enacted by the
authority of this present Parliament, that from and after the first day of May
next coming, no person or persons of what estate, degree, quality, or
condition soever he or they be, by any corrupt, colorable, or deceitful
conveyance, slight, or engine, or by any way or mean, shall lend, give, set
out, deliver or forbear any sum or sums of money, to any person or
persons, or to any Corporation or body politic, to or for any manner of
usury, increase, lucre, gain, or interest to be had, received or hoped for,
over and above the sum or sums so lent, given, set out, delivered or
forborne, upon forfeiture of the value as well of the sum and sums so lent,
given, set out, delivered or forborne, as also of the usury, increase, lucre,
gain or interest thereof, and also upon pain of imprisonment of the body or
bodies of every such offender or offenders, and also to make fine and ransom
at the Kings will and pleasure; the moity of which forfeiture of the said value
shall be to the King, and the other moity to the party that will sue for the
same, in any of the Kings Courts of Record, by Action of debt, Bill, plaint, or
information, wherein no wager of Law, essoigne, or protection shall be allowed
or admitted. So much has the Statute of 5. and 6. of King Edward the sixth.
The Statute of the thirteenth year of Queen Elizabeth, by which in some sort
it is allowed again to avoyde farther inconveniences, has in it this Clause;
for as much as all Usury being forbidden by the Law of God is sin, and
detestable, etc. and by the same Statute, it is enacted that the Statute of
thirtie-seaventh of King Henry the eight shall be most largely construed for
the suppressing of Usury. By the ancient fundamental Laws of the Kingdom of
England, it has been condemned as a thing most By the old Law of England, all
the mooveable goods of an Usurer after his death were to be seized to the use
of the King, though he made a Will, if a Jury found that he lived and dyed in
that sin; and for that cause his heir was to be dis-inherited, and his lands
to escheate.

remain within the Confines of the Kingdom; and if any man had been Convicted
thereof, he was to forfeite all his substance, and to be reputed as an Outlaw.
In the time of King Henry the second, they were denied Christian burial: in
the Court of France, it was the common and ordinary Table-talke, as Edward the
Confessor observed, during that time that he made his abode there, Quod Vide

vsura radix omnium malorum esset, that there was no evil in that Court that
had not that for a beginning. So odious has this been esteemed in these parts
of the world; neither has it been distasteful only to these parts, but Asia
and Africa in general have detested and abhorred it. Lucullus after that he
had Conquered Asia, studying how to win the people unto him, could not think
of a better means then to set them free from Plutarch in Lucullo.
Usury. And Cato having devoted himself to do good unto Sicilia, made this
Law, desirous to free it from unnecessary members, that no Usurer should dwell
within the Confines of it. Licurgus did so much abhor it, that he made a Law,
that in Sparta it should not be so much as named. Bocchoris in Egypt made a
Law, to banish it absolutely, which Solon brought into Athens, and called it

contentment. The reverend Fathers of the Church have made an inquiry, and
examined those kind of people upon Interrogatories, why they should persist in
their Jewish and unchristian course of life, and they can give no other Answer
than what Thieves, Robbers, and Strumpets do for the maintenance and upholding
of their professions, Eleganter redarguit faeneratores August: audent

but not a toto. But can our delinquent plead any such plea? Not; he has taken
away the lives of many, that were never guilty of any such crying sin It was
a pretty passage which happened between the Skinner and the Usurer; these two
meeting on the way, the poor Skinner humbly saluted the proud Usurer, and
desired further acquaintance of him, as being brothers of a fraternity, and
birds of a feather: the Usurer disdainfully beholding him, would needs know how
it should come to pass, that there should be such an affinity between them
two. Marry (quoth he) if with patience you will hear me, I will tell you, and
will not go so far to derive my pedigree, as the Quidam petijt Ele^mosynam a

live, and I deal in the skins of brute beasts and stay until they be dead;

Crows than flatterers; because that Crows feed not but upon dead Carcasses,
but Flatterers upon living men. It may as truly be verified of Usurers; for if
there be any Canniballs in our Horizon, these are they. The Turks hold, that
in the Resurrection all men shall rise again with different faces: that some
shall appear with faces as clear as the Sun; others with faces as clear as
the Moon; others as the Stars: some again with faces as black as darkness
it self; others with swollen tongues; others with Hogs faces; that they which
attained to any perfection of goodness whilst they walked upon the face of
the earth, shall appear as glorious as the Sun; that others that lived
virtuously, but attained not to that measure of perfection, shall appear like
unto the Moon and Stars; that those that lived viciously and lewdly, shall
appear with faces as black as darkness it self; that they which gave
themselves over to lying, swearing, and blasphemy, shall appear with swollen
tongues, but as for Usurers, that they shall have no resemblance of the faces
of men, but shall appear with faces like unto hogs and swine. Nay, they go
further, they hold that they which live upon De faenore viventes non nisi quasi

Usury, shall not rise again, otherwise then with the Devils, as appears
amongst their Tenets in their Alcaron. Where this Caveat is given, Ye which
are good fear God, and eschew Usury, least the anger of God and the Prophet
assoile you. There are many pretty tales whorded up in History of these kind
of people. And amongst those many I find this, that upon a certain time a
Priest being willing to grant absolution to as many as desired it, wished them
according to their several mysteries to stand up as he called them, and as
they were absolved so to depart, and first he began and called upon the Fabros,
who stood up and were absolved and departed; then upon the Pannifices, who did
likewise and departed; then upon the Carpentarios, Ferrarios, and Macellarios,
who all stood up and were absolved and departed: at last, he calls upon
Vsurarios, who being ashamed of their profession, sat still and would not
rise. Whereupon he demanded, Qualiter apparebunt in die judicij ad recipiendam
ae^ernam maledictionem, qui coram hominibus non audent surgere ad
benedictionem? how will they appear in the last day before God to receive a
malediction, that dare not show themselves before men to receive a benediction?


Rustic: Sir, you have said enough, give me leave I pray you, to interrupt you
a little. I have heard of a man whose name was Philo^enum inter gulae proceres
posuit antiquitas, quod convivijs adhibitis in paropsides emungeret, vt
abstinenribus caeteris solus ille frueretur. A junt optasse sibi collum gruis.
Philoxenus, a kind of Epicure and belly-god, that if at any time he had seen
a dish at a Table that he liked above the rest, that he would have taken some
occasion in Paropsides emungere, to spit into the platter where the meat was:
to the end, that others abstaining, he might more freely feed upon it. And of
Philotas, who being in love with Antigona, in all companies where he came,
would most bitterly enveigh against her, to the end, that others absenting
themselves, he might the more freely enjoy her: and of a Aen^as Sylvius.
Usurer that dwelt at Millaine, who in all companies where he came, would
bitter enveigh against Usury, vt prohibitis reliquis solus ipse faeneraretur;
that others forbearing, he might the more freely exercise the trade. But I hope
better of you, that you were never bred up at Millaine a Disciple under that
Scholemaster.


Iurisp: If you will believe me Sir, I never was, neither do I speak
affectionately or maliciously; Vsura pugnat cum lege naturae; contra naturam
est (vt ait Aristot.) vt pecunia pariat pecuniam: pugnat cum lege dei, vt
apparet in diversis locis sacrae scripturae: pugnat cum legibus Canonicis:
Nicano enim confilio damnata est omnis vsura: pugnat cum legibus municipalibus
vniuscujusque provinciae: pugnat cum bonis moribus. Ethnici (vt Plutarch: and
alij scripserunt) totos libros de non faenerando. Approbata est autem solummodo
causa necessitatis, vt apparet in diversis statutis pro bono publico Anglorum
constitutis.
for as I never got any thing by it, nor intend ever to do, so I never lost
any thing by it, nor I hope ever shall do, but because I find it condemned by
the law of God, by the law of Nature, by the Canonical Laws, by the
Municipall Laws of all Nations, yea, even by the laws of the Heathens,
therefore and for no other reason do I condemn it, and adjudge it as a thing
hateful both before God and men.


Rustic: You have given me good satisfaction. I pray you go on to the next in
your Catalogue.


Iurid: The next in the Catalogue is the Monopolizer, who is so deformed in
every part, that if I should go about to paynt out his deformity, I fear I
should purchase no more credit by it then the Painters in Apelles time did by
paynting out of Venus Apelles painted out one part of Venus so to the life,
that he did disgrace all the Painters of his time.
beauty. Yet I will adventure upon him, and first upon the fairest part of
him, which is foul enough, his face is like the face of Vespasian looked as if
he had been strayning for a stool. Sueton: in Vespasian. -- Vultus gibbosus,

Nasus curvatus, and faedus; autis acuta:
Et grandis cervix dependens and macilenta;
Caesaries and barba rigens frons and gena pallens.

Vespasian, or the face which Diogenes spit upon, who coming into a house that
was newly swept and garnished, was requested vt salivam noneijceret, that he
would not spit but into some foul corner of it. Who seeing the good man of the
house pass by him, spit full in his face, and being reproved for it, answered
(...), that in all the house he could not find a fouler place: and for the
other parts of his body, they are proportioned like unto the Reeves in the
English Poet. Chawcer.
The Reeve was a slender Choleric man,

His hair was by his ears round yshorne,
His top was docked like a Priest beforne;
Full long were his legs and eke full leans,

And as for his qualities and condition, they are as deformed as is his outward
feature and proportion; his thoughts are only fixed upon himself, and cares
not though all the trees of the Forest were taken with such untimely fruit, as
Ferunt Timonem cum vidiffet hominem in arbore suspensun, optasse vt quottannis
tali fructu omnes arbores exuberent; ideoque non immerito appellatus est (...).
Timon sometimes unnaturally desired, so that he may but enjoy the fruits of
the Forest. That loves no man, neither is beloved of any. A common enemy, a
general grievance, a stumbling block, and block of offense to the Citizen,
to the Countryman, to the people in general. The Citizen complains of him,
that he takes away his living from him, which he has purchased at a dear
rate, with the expense of seven years painful labors. The Countryman
complains, that he has enhaunsed the Commodities of the City, and that he
finds not that friendly and familiar entertainment there that he was used to
do; that in stead of Optatives, he is entertained with Imperatives, in stead
of mild and gentle persuasions and entreaties, he is entertained with
imperious Commands: and in stead of satisfactory Answers, with sharp
reprehensions; for if at any time he chance to make any enquiries how
Commodities came to be so enhaunsed, he is presently silenced, and must make no
reply, because Monopolium est cum penes vnum aliquem tantum vendendi poteff^^

he knows not whither else to go. The people in general complain, that by
reason of him, Trading is much decayed, for that the Citizen in a manner is
compelled to forsake his habitation, and to betake himself into the Country:
and the Countryman is discouraged to send his son for education to the
City. So that every man you meet withal, can tell you of this man. Yet there
is one other mark, by which you may know him. He is always talking of the
common good, and pretends nothing more, whereas he intends nothing less, for

Thais by her neigbours upon the first sight is discovered to be Thais, not
withstanding all the glorious ornaments and outsides she can put on. And the
first hatchers of these new devises, to be for the most part like Seafaring
men, who having suffered Shipwreck at Sea, are ready to catch hold of every
mast and planke, and pole of the ship, to help themselves. The next in the
Catalogue, are Enclosers, a kind of greedy people, and somewhat allied to the
former, who rob the Kingdom, not of the meanest Commodities of it by
exportation, but of the chiefest treasure of it, the ablest men by expulsion
and depopulation, by taking their lands and livings from them, and sending them
into the highwayes or foreign parts, to seek their fortunes. The next are The

Forestallers, Regrators, and Ingrossers, who out of a covetous desire of
having, will not suffer the Commodities of the Country to come unto the City:
or if they can be content to suffer them to come unto the common Market, yet
there they will meet with them, and so first or last will make their private
Granaries the public Markets, whither every man must come and pray and pay
before he can have it. The next in the Catalogue, are corrupt and ill-affected
Justices; such as Exodus 18. verse. 21.
Iethro wished Moses to be ware of, men addicted to greedy Covetousness, that
make too much use of their hands in the execution of their places, which
Apelles never thought of when he pictured them without hands, as he did Justice
without eyes. And these are of diverse kinds: either such as aspire to places
of authority, not so much to execute the Law according to Justice, as for
their private ends, to pleasure their Nulla erit distantia personarum apud

friends. Which Publius Rutilius reproved in his friend; who soliciting him in
a business not befitting him to do, gave him a sharp answer, which his
friend taking to heart, told him that in aftertimes he would not care for such
friendship: to whom Rutilius pithily replied, nor he for such a friend as would
move him in a thing not beseeming him to do, and which Themistocles reproved
in Simonides the Poet, who soliciting him in an unjust cause, told him that
Simonides could never be good Poet, except he did observe the Rules of Poetry,
nor Themistocles good. Praetor, if he should respect any man's person in the
distribution of Justice. And which Bias took special notice of, when he
affirmed that in matters of Controversy, he had rather have to do with his
enemies that his friends; for that of his friends he was sure to draw one of
them to be his enemy, but of his enemies one of them to be his friend. Or such
as stifle and smoother up Causes in corners, which would be heard in public,
and in the view of the world. Which Antigonus reproved in his Brother Marsias,
who having a suite depending, desired that it might not be scanned in public,
and in the view of the world: to whom Antigonus in some indignation answered;

answered wherefore are the Courts of Justice instituted? I had rather that thy

Councellor replied, What guilty man then will be condemned, if he may be
permitted to make an excuse? To whom Julian again; nay, rather what innocent
may not be condemned, if sentence be given before he be heard. Of which
Alexander took special notice, who upon the hearing of any cause, laid one of
his hands upon one of his ears, and being asked the reason, answered, that he

hearing of Causes, which is well reproved in Plutarch in Philipp^.
Philip of Macedone by the appeal of Machetes, who being tried before him and
condemned, appealed from his sentence, which Philip taking very ill, would
needs know to whom he would appeal, who answered ad teipsum o Rex si
expergiscaris, and attentius audias causam; to none other then to himself,
from Philip sleeping, to Philip waking. And which is reproved in Honorius by
his beloved Sister. Lonicerus.
Honorius being accustomed to put his hand unto writings before he had perused
them, which his Sister perceiving, and observing many inconveniences to arise
by reason thereof, and having a desire to beat him from it; caused a Writing
to be drawn, by which he should promise her in marriage to a man of an ignoble
condition, far inferior unto her in every degree, which the Lady having
gotten into her hands, came unto Honorius upon her knees and desired him that
she might have the privilege of the meanest subject within his Dominion, and
that she might not be enforced to marry such a one as she could neither like
nor love. Which when Honorius heard, he wondered at, and with many protestations
affirmed, that he never dreamt of any such thing. But when the Lady showed him
his handwriting, he found it to be pravam and parum tutam lonsuetudinem, an
ill Custom, and resolved in aftertimes to be more careful how he put his
hand to any Writing before he perused it. The next in the Catalogue, are
Counselors, Advocates, and Atturneys, who to gain a Fee, or a blast of fame
in the world, endeavor as much as in them lie to seduce the Judge that sits to
decide Controversies, and to distribute Justice to every one aright. The next
are Tradesmen and Artificers, which use false weights, lights or measures, of
whom the Deuteronomy. 25.
Laws of God and men have taken special notice. The next are double dealing
vnder-Sheriffes, who by miscarrying of themselves in their places, have brought
the name of Vnder-Sherrife into contempt, and have made the name of Vicecomes
as odious almost as was the name of Vicarius in Martials time. The name of
Vicar was sometimes honorable, and none could execute that office but such as
ex mandato principis Diaecesin aliquam regebant. But afterward when Churches
began to be impropriated by Prioresses and Nuns, which of Quibus in rebus

themselves could not say divine service, nor administer the Sacraments, then
it grew into contempt, for they regularly made choice of such stipendary
Priests to execute the Cures, whom they could have best cheap, whom they
called Vicars. By which means the name of Vicar grew to be more vile than the
name of a servant; as we find in the Martial.
Poet: Esse sat est servum jam nolo Vicarius esse. The name of Sheriff,
Viscount, Comes, and Procomes was ever honorable, amongst the Germans (as
Tacitus observes) none were named Comites but such as were principibus in
Consilijs; and amongst the Romans the Council of the Emperor were called
Caesaris Comitatus is dicitur locus, in quo vitam agit princeps, et Palatini

Comitatus, who were used in secretis, or in remotis. Those which were used in
secretis, were much honored and had access to the Emperor at all times, and
upon all occasions: those which were used in more remotis, were honored
likewise, though not in so high a degree as the other were, as Comes domorum
erat ille, qui in domesticos principis praefecturam habebat.

Caesaris.
Comes patrimonij; all these were Comites and Consiliarij, though in diverse
degrees. When the government of the Roman Empire began to spread it self into
other parts of the world, then this title began to spread it self likewise.
The Saxons used it, but not by the same name as the Romans did; for those
which they called Comites and we Earls the Saxons called Ealdermen, and the
Danes, Earlas, which was a title and dignity not hereditary in this Kingdom,
as now it is, but temporary and arbitrary, until the time of William the
Conqueror, who was the first that made it hereditary; for he having subdued
the Kingdom, the affairs of the State being not fully settled, he created
diverse Counts as Overseers and Watchmen of certain Counties; who because they
were much with the King had Viscounts, who did execute the Kings Command in
these Counties; so that the Office of Vicecomes (vt inquit Ferneus) est, cui
Comes co^mittit vices suas, sive gubernatio ^ nem Castri.
Vicecomes was even from the Conquest, though the hereditary dignity of The
first Viscount that was in England was made in the time of King Hen: the 6. as
says Sir John Davis in his reports. But Sir John Fern in his Book entitled
The glory of Generositie, affirms that Escote Ville was the first Viscount,
and that he had that honor conferred upon him about the days of King Hen: the
1. and King Stephen.
Viscounts were not known until the time of King Henry the sixth in these
parts, or until the days of King Henry the first and King Stephen. But not
long after the very first Creation of their Office, did these Vicecomites and
their subordinate Officers, break forth into diverse outrages, and began to
pill and pole the people, in so much that Pet: Bles: Epist. 95.
Peter Blesensis, who lived in the days of King Henry the second, and was a
Chauncelor of Canterbury, in an Epistle dedicated unto him, thus inveighs
against them. Forestariorum siquidem ac Vicecomitum innumeri officiales, dum
avaritiae and Cupiditati suae satisfacere student, depraedantur pauperes.
Simplicibus insidiantur, fovent impios, opprimunt innocents, exultant in rebus
pessimis, laetantur cum male fecerint, peccata populi Comedunt, luxuriantur in
lachrymis, and in fame pupillorum, in pauperum nuditate, in afflictione
simplicium. Sic pauperes vicecomitum, aut nemoralium judicum and aliorum
Collateralium sunt esca and potus, ac publica depraedationis occasio. In this
Epistle he shows that the greatest grievances in our Commonwealth, have their
original from them, and their indirect proceedings. For that they regularly
return, and make choice of such to enquire of offenses, as either for favor
or commodity, do rather cover and color, then discover and make known
abuses to the world. The King and Judges he freely acquitteth; the King,
because it is impossible for him to understand of all abuses that are
committed: for if in a Cum multa fiunt in domibus quae dominorum notitiae
subducantur, non est vestrae negligentiae aut incuriae ascribendum; si in tam
speciosis and dif^usis regionibus, quibus dominus vos praefecit, singuloru^

private family (says he) diverse things happen which never come to the
understanding of the Master, it is not to be imputed to any carelesnes in any
Prince, if in a Kingdom which consists of many thousand families, diverse
things happen which never come to his knowledge. The Judges likewise he
excuses, because things are smoothered, and either for love or affection, or
consanguinitie and affinity, or for some other respect, they are never
presented, and so he lays the whole blame upon the Forestarios and
Vicecomites. Such were the complaints against these kind of people in the days
of King Henry the second. Again, in the time of King Edward the first, they
were complained of in Parliament for their extortion, and oppression. Whereupon
there was Westminster 1. Cap. 26.
a Law made that no Sheriff should take any thing to do his office of any
other then the King, upon pain to forfeit double as much as he should take,
and to endure imprisonment at the Kings will and pleasure. In the days of King
Edward the third they were complained of again, for that they would not
receive any prisoners without fees paid unto them: whereupon there was Stat. de
An. 4^0. Edw. 3 Cap. 10.
a Law made, that no Sheriff or Jailer should take any thing for receiving of
felons. In the days of King Henry the fourth, they were complained of again
for their extortion. Whereupon there was Anno 1. Hen: 4.
a Law made, that if a Sheriff did any extortion, he should be punished at the
Kings pleasure. In the days of King Henry the sixth, they were complained of
again, for the extorting of excessive fees, for the making of Arrests.
Whereupon there was An. 23 Hen: 6. Cap. 10.
a Law made which did limit and determine what fees they should take. That the
Sheriff should have xx. d. The Bailie that made the Arrest iiij. d. and the
Jailer iiij d. In the days of King Henry the seventh, they were complained of
again, for that they did often enter plaints in other men's names, and caused
Amerciaments to be made for not appearance, whereas the parties amercied were
never summoned, and by that means made pillage of the people. Whereupon there
was 11. Hen: 7. Cap. 15.
a Law made, that no plaint should be entered, unless the party to whom the
debt was due, was then present at the time of the entry thereof. Again, in the
days of Queen Elizabeth, they were complained of again for their taking of
excessive fees upon the serving of Writs of Execution. Whereupon there was An.
29. Eliz. Cap. 4.
a Law made, which does set down what they should take, and no more, viz. if
that the debt did not amount unto above the sum of 100. li. they should take

that this abuse of that honorable title of Count and Viscount, is no innovation
or new thing, but has been growing of old, and now it is come to that growth
of scandal and ignominy, vt probrum pene sit esse probum, that it is a kind
of disparagement for a man to be honest in the execution of the office, or at
least for an honest man to take a deputation of it. It being a Proverb or
byword rather, to be twice or thrice an Vndersheriffe, is to be a dishonest
man ever after. It is regularly an honor we know for any man to undergo any
office of command and authority, and the more often he does it, the more honor
it is still unto him. But in the execution of this place it is not, and why?
because by abuse it is become ignominious, and contemptible. It is worthy our
pains therefore to enquire where the fault is. Is it in the Vicecomes? I wish
I could say no, but I cannot; for he does depute such subordinate Ministers and
Officers under him, as do pill and pole the people. If a Bishop be never so
hospitious, charitable, and religious himself, yet if his Nulla regis
aequitate, vel prudentia, vel labor salva possit esse respub: nisi etia^
magistratus inferiores suum faciunt officium; nam frustra est omnium judicum
industria, fi suu^ Iraenar^^ae subtrahunt anxilium. Vt ait Iac. nuper Rex in
oratione 5ta.
Stewards, Bailiffs, and other his Agents do rack and pole his Tenants, it is
all one to the Tenants as if the Bishop himself did it. If a Judge shall be
never so just, upright, and free from corruption, yet if his servants and
attendants shall exact and extort from the subject, it is all one to the
subject as if the Judge himself had done it. If an Officer be never so regular
and confine himself to take no other fees, than are allowed by the Laws and
Statutes of the Realm, yet if his subordinate Clarks shall prey upon and exact
of the Client, it is all one to the Client, if the Officer himself had done
it. If a Sheriff be never so just, and his intentions never so good, yet if he
commit the deputation of his Office to such as prey upon the Commonwealth, it
is all one to the Commonwealth if the Sheriff himself did it: therefore it
behooveth men in authority to have a special eye and regard whom they do use
in the managing of their affairs; for that the Law will tell them, what they
do by another in case of deputation, they do it by themselves.


Rustic: Sir, you have sufficiently painted out these kind of people: if there
be any more of the same fraternity, I pray you let me know them, that I may
avoid them.


Iurid: I have named unto you all the principalls already, yet Accessaries
there are of both kinds, both Accessaries before, and Accessaries after the
deed done.


Rustic: And who are they?


Iurid: Accessaries before the fact done, are Parents, who train up their
children in idleness, the broad way to destruction; who are well set forth in
the Apologue, in the Peccantem puerum quis-quis non corrigit, odit.
Non inutile consiliu^ poetae;
Qui laetam laeta natorum forte senectam
Optatis patres, duris neu parcite dictis;
Virtutem exemplo, mixtoque docete pudore.
Non secus ac pullos plausis circumvolat alis
Rex avium.
Fathers if you desire your children sage,
should by their blessings bless your crooked age;
Train them betimes unto true vertueslore,
By awe, instruction, and example more.
So the old Eagle flitters in and out,
To teach his young-ones to follow him about.

son upon the Gibbet, and the indulgent Mother, the son upon the gallows
espying his mother among the multitude, called unto her, pretending to have
somewhat to say unto her: whom his sorrowful mother readily observed and came
unto him, and whilst she listened to hear what he would say unto her, the
son espying his opportunity, in stead of his tongue used his teeth, and bit
off her note, and in scorn cast the same amongst the multitude, with this
Anathema, Such reward have all such indulgent Parents as train up their
children to such preferment as he was come unto. Accessaries after the fact,
are such as stop the Course of Justice, interceding for such as deservedly
ought to undergo the Censure of the Law. Who are well set forth in the
Citizens of Lonicerus ex Mar: Luther.
Oinguez villain il vous poindra:
Poinguez villain et il vous oindra.
Anoint a knave and he will annoy you:
But gall a knave and he will anoint you.
These sort of men are aptly compared to Nettles; if you handle them gently
they will sting you, but if you press them they will never hurt you. And as a
child preetily cute told his Father, that there was a thing grew in the garden,
that was worse then a dog, meaning a Netle, because that a dog will never bite
any of his own house: so we say of these people, because they bite very
oftentimes their best friends.


Brandenberg; the Citizens of Brandenberg feeing a young man of a comely
personage and countenance, that promised much, condemned for a light offense;
they all with one unanimous consent, made intercession for his pardon, which
being granted, and the Theife set at liberty; not long after in requital
thereof, he returned to their City and burnt it, and being asked, how he could
be so barbarously ungrateful, to take away the liuelihood of them, that had
been the means to save his life, gave them this answer in effect, that they
deserve no liuelihood, that deprive the Law of life, which is the due execution
of it.


Rustic: I am glad to hear you rank Monopolizers, Enclosers, Regrators,
Engrosers, and Forestallers among the enemies of the Commonwealth; for in many
places I hear they pass for good husbands, wise and provident men, and are
called unto places of command and authority.


Iurid: Truly in our Coasts we esteem of them in the body politic, no
otherwise than we do of boyles and ulcers in the natural body, and will allow
unto them no other place to dwell in, than that City which Philip of Macedone
built for the excrements of his Kingdom, and called it by the name of Plutarch
in Philipp: Maced.
Poneropolis Civitas Nebulonum, yet I must confess, they thrust themselves
sometimes into places of authority and command, and gird themselves about with
Fures privatorum furtorum in nervo atque in compedibus aetatem agunt, sures
publici in auro atque purpura.

Aulaus Gell: lib. 11. cap. 18.
Chains of gold. But the multitude repine at it, for they think they better
deserve it that lie bound in chains of iron; for as to rob and steal from
many is a greater offense, than to steal from a few, so the fault of the one
is greater than the other.


Rustic: I pray you go on, and show me what are the Laws that punish the
delinquents in both kinds.


Iurid: I will therein satisfy you. And first what are Laws which do punish
thieves properly so called: the Laws which do punish thieves properly so
called, are comprehended under those titles, Dererum divisione, de acquirendo
rerum dominio, de rerum vindicatione, de furtis, peculatu, and sacrilegijs,
etc. all which are made to maintain and uphold that part of Justice which the
Iusticiaries have named Commutative Justice, that punish wrong and roberry, and
root out the fraternity of them that live upon the spoil by other men's
labors, such as were in the days of King Richard the first, Robbin Hood and
Little John.


Rustic: What are the punishments which the Laws have provided for such
malefactors?


Iurid: By the Imperial Laws whosoever takes away any thing from any man
above the value of v. s. is to suffer death for the same. If under that value,
for the first offense he is to be branded with the ignominious name of Theft;
and if he be a freeman, he is to be banished for a certain time. If of a
servile condition, he is to undergo the punishment which Commanders use to
inflict upon such soldiers as forsake their Colors; and is called Fustuarium
^^ eretur qui signa reliquit, aut praesidio decedit.

Lips: lib. 5. tolit. This punishment did Tiberius Nero cause to be inflicted
upon one, who having authority to clear the passage, did not do it.

Sueton: in Tiber: Ner. Pro primo peccato fur, pro secundo fur consuetus, pro
tertio fur famosus appellatus.

Fulbeck.
Fustuarium, bastinadoing: for the second offense he is to be branded with the
ignominious name of an old Theife, and to loose one of his ears. For the third
offense, he is to be branded with the name of a notorious old Theife, and toe
suffer death as in case he had taken away the value of us. By the Laws of the
Kingdom of England, whosoever takes away any thing from any man to above the
value of xij. d. his life may be questioned for the same; if under that value,
then to be stockt and whipped.


Rustic: Sir, in my opinion, the Laws of England do very much undervalue the
life of man.


Iurid: No certainly; for no punishment can be great enough for such, who
having eyes, and hands, and legs, and limbs, and are able to purchase a
livelihood to themselves, even in the most barren parts of the world, will yet
notwithstanding roue up and down, beg and steal, and expose themselves rather
to an ignominious death for a trifle at home, then undergo any labor, or
adventure themselves in the face of their enemies abroad, where honor is to be
found, giving occasion thereby to our neighboring friends beyond the Seas, to
condemn our Laws, and to magnify their own. For that in all their Coasts
there are not such mendicant vagrant persons to be seen. The Laws of Plutarch
in Solone.
Draco did punish him in an equal degree, that had stolen but an Apple, with
him that had stolen an Ox. Yet the Lawgivers did not always give full reins
to those Laws, but set them in a Table, as they did the Dragon above the
Judicial seat, to the terror of the beholder. The Alexand: ab Alexand: lib.
6. cap. 10. Eadem severitas inter Romanos; nam lex 12. tabularum adeo furto
adversata est, vt furem manifestum in servitutem tradat illi, cui furto
quidquam substractum foret; and si nocte furtum factum sit, si aliquis occidit,
jure caesus est. Totum hoc commemorat Aulus. Gell: lib. 11. cap. 18. Vbi probat
Decemviros non tam gravi severitate vsos suisse in punie^do fures, vt Draco qui
furtu^ omne morte puni^e vellet; neque tanta lenitate, vt Solon, qui sublato
mortis supplicio duplitantu^ paenam furibus indixit, sed mediam quandamrationem
puniendi delegisse.


Laws of the Athenians likewise did punish idle persons in an equal degree
with thieves and robbers; amongst whom, if the mendicant Scholar had set up
his trade, their Laws would quickly have found him out. It was a pretty
passage which happened upon a time, between a Scholar and a Farmar; A
Scholar coming to a Farmars house for an Alms, the Farmar seeing him to be
young and lusty, and well able to take pains for a living, fell foul upon
him, and plainly told him, that he was Multis authoribus docemur non tam
paupertati condolete, quam mendicitatem detestari; nam public mendicare, and
circumire civitates, semper vbique gentium ab initio prohibitum suit: In lege
Romana atcte statuit Iustinlanus Imperator, vt si quis laborarepote^s elcemo.

Cornel: Agripp.
an idle knave, and bid him be gone and work for his living as he did: which
the Scholar taking very disdainefully, answered him thus, Non te pudit
(sordide agrestis) Bacchalaureum septenarum liberalium artium temerario ore
lacerare, are you not ashamed, you Country Clown, to revile a Bachelour of
seven Arts with such opprobrious terms? To whom the Farmar again replied; of
what Arts, Sir, are you a Bachelor? Of none other I believe then of the
drinking art, of the whoring art, of the theeving art, of the cheating and
cosening art, of the lying and swearing art, of the begging art, and of the
reviling and backbiting art. Ego art vnica Agriculturae and vxorem and multos
alo liberos, and tu, qui septem jactas arts, turpiter mendicas; I have but one
art, and with that one I maintain my family, my wife and children; and you
with your seven Arts are not ashamed basely to beg of me that have but one.
Abi impostor, and take it for a warning, that if I catch you here again, I
will make you know that we have Laws will punish such Bachelors of seven
Arts, whom we call sturdy rogues and mendicant vagabonds. If this man (I say,)
had set up his trade in Athens, it had been death unto him. So strict were the
Laws of the Athenians against idle persons, though they took nothing away.
The Adversum errones (vt inquit Iac: nupet Rex in orationest1) legem habemus ab
Edw: 6t^ lata^; cujus regis prudentia magis h^c en^^uit in incunte aet^te, quam
aliorum in adulta.
Laws of England, I must confess, in the strict execution of them, do punish
a small offense sometimes with death: yet those Laws do receive diverse
mitigations. First, it is in the bosom of the Jurors to mitigate the same; for
trials of Criminal causes being regularly by the oaths of 12. honest and able
men. Those honest men in their wisdoms and discretions, if the value of the
thing taken and stolen away, do not plainly appear unto them, do often
value the thing though it be of treble the value of xij. d. to be under the
value, then the wisdom of the Kingdom by several Acts of Parliament have
specially provided, that if the felony be not aggravated with some
circumstances odious in the eye of the Law, the offender is admitted to his
Clergy, and so undergoing some light punishment, such as the Laws in such
cases have provided, the offender is to escape without any other punishment.


Rustic: Sir, by the Law of God, a quadruple restitution was held a good
satisfaction, how comes it to pass then, I pray you, that the punishment
should now be so grievous, and so much differing from the penalty appointed by
the Law of God?


Iurid: In the time of the Jewish Commonwealth, the Iubile was solemnised
every fiftieth year; but in the Commonwealth of the Romans, it was changed
from fiftieth to a hundred, from a hundred to fifty again; from fifty to
twentie-five; one of the Popes being demanded the reason why in the
solemnization of the Iubile, the Roman Commonwealth did so much differ from
the Jewish, gave them this Answer, Non convenit politia Indaica politiae
Romanae, that those several Commonwealths were governed by several Laws and
Customs, and that which was thought fit in the government of the one, was not
thought necessary in the government of the other: the same answer in effect may
I give unto you. Non convenit politia Indaica politiae Anglicanae, the
Commodities of the earth when Moses Laws were given to the Jews, were not of
that estimation as in after times they were in those parts of the world where
the Laws are so strict against thieves and robbers. And therefore there needed
not such severe punishments, as now are provided against such malefactors.
Again, the Laws of Commonwealths ebb and flow, rise and fall, live and die;
that which was Law in the times of our progenitors, perhaps in our times is no
Law, and that which is now Law, perhaps in the next age, though in the same
Commonwealth, will be none; therefore no marvel, though the Laws of one
Nation differ from the Laws of another; the Laws of England from the Laws of
the Jews.


Rustic: You have sufficiently showed what the Laws and punishments against
private thieves are; in the next place, I pray you, acquaint me what are the
Laws against pulicke thieves to the Commonwealth, I mean, Enclosers,
Forestallers, Regrators, and Engrossers, and Sheriffs that abuse their places.


Iurid: Sir, the punishments are of different natures, according to the
different Laws. The punishment of the Enclosers in one kind, the punishment
of the Forestaller in another, of the Sheriff in another. The 4. Hen: 7. Cap.
19.
punishment of the Encloser, that shall turn tillage into pasture, is a
forfeiture of one half of the revenue of the land so converted: the punishment
of 5. Edw: 6. Cap. 14.
the Forestaller, Regrator, and Ingrosser, is for the first offense two months
imprisonment, and a forfeiture of the goods so forestalled and engrossed. For
the second offense, a forfeiture of double the value of the goods so
forestalled and engrossed, and half a years imprisonment. For the third
offense, it is imprisonment at the Kings will and pleasure; together with the
punishment of the Pillory, and forfeiture of all his goods and Chattels; who in
former times were grown so odious in the eye of the Commonwealth, that they
were not thought fit to live in a Civil Society: and therefore by a
Statute Law made in the days of King See the Stat. of the 3I. year of Edw.
the first.
Edward the I. they were turned out of all Towns, and sent into the remote
places to seek their habitations. The punishment of the Sheriff for exacting
more than is allowed him by the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, is An. 29.
Eliz. Cap. 4.
treble damages to the party that is abused, and forty pound to the King,
whereof one moitie is to go to the King; the other moitie to the partle that
will sue for the same; as in case a Sheriff for making of an Arrest will take
above xx. d. and in case of serving of a Writ of Execution, will take above
xij. d. in the pound, where the sum amounts not to the value of a hundred
pound. Thus briefly have I showed what punishments the Laws have provided
against private thieves; and what punishments they have provided, for many of
those before-named public thieves, or enemies to the Commonwealth.


Rustic: I pray you go on and acquaint me, what Laws are derived out of the
next Laws, as they stand in order in the Decalogue.


Iurid: I will therein satisfy you likewise; and first I will show unto you
what the Laws are; then the excellency of those Laws by the antiquity of
them; then how strict the Turks, and the very Heathens have been in keeping of
them, by the performance of such vows and promises as they made; then how
odious and detestable the infringers, that is to say, liars, swearers,
rumor-raysers, and perjured persons have been amongst them, and what
punishments they provided for them; then how miraculously God has punished
those kind of people; and, lastly, what punishments the Laws under which we
live, have provided for them. You shall understand, in the first place, that
all those National Laws, that conjoyne Princes in Leagues and Truces one to
another, all the several municipall Laws of Nations, that decide
Controversies between party and party, and generally all Laws that uphold
society and commerce between man and man are hence derived, and are
comprehended under these titles, De actionibus and judicijs, de accusationibus,
de calumniatoribus, de pravaricatoribus, de testibus, probationibus and
appellationibus. The excellency of which Laws is manifested unto us by the
long use and continuance of them, it being the most true and surest mark of a
good and absolute Law; they being approved, and practiced by all sorts of
people, by the Prophets and Patriarks, Apostles and Evangelists, Turks and
Mahumetans, Heathens and Barbarians. Abraham amongst the Patriarks used it, he
made a Covenant with Abimeleck, and took an oath, and because he had done so,
he faithfully observed it, though it were to Abimeleck. The apostles and
Evangelists used it, and that it might not loose the honor and reverence due
unto it, gave special Command that in trivial affairs an oath should not be
administered, nor in any other places, but at the August.
Tombs of the Martyrs; which in the time of the primitive Church were the
places where Controversies were decided. Amurah took an oath, and though it
were to the King of Hungary, a Christian King, yet observed it: and Regulus
took an oath, though it were to the Carthaginians his professed enemies, yet
would not violate it: and Pompey having made but a promise, that he might not
be thought careless of it, exposed himself to imminent danger: so that oaths
were used even from the beginning, by all sorts of people, though in a
different manner. The Book which the Prophets and Patriarks did use to swear
upon, was the Book of Moses; the Book which the Apostles and Evangelists used
was the book of the new Testament; the Book which the Turks and Mahumetans
used, was their Alcoran;the obligation by which the Heathens bound themselves,
was the name of Jupiter regularly. Yet they had their Multiplex apud gentes

Alexand: ab Alexand. lib. 5^
diverse forms of oaths: Socrates had his goose to swear by; Zeno his dog;
Plato his Themides; yet all had their Jupiter; whose presence when they
implored, they would sooner, die; than infringe their faith. It is remarkable
to see how strictly the old Romans did observe their words, and observe such
engagements as they had undertaken: they had a custom amongst them that when
any league or truce had been made between them and their enemies, to put the
same in Writing; and afterward to cause their Faeciales, which did execute the
same Office with them as our Heralds do with us, to proclaim the same in the
Frontiers of the enemies Country, and to call upon their great God Jupiter, to
bear witness that whatsoever was to be performed on the parts of the Romans,
they did promise to keep Faeciallium juramentum fuit haec verba proferre; si
sine dolo hoc faedus facio, dij mihi cuncta faelicia praestent; sin aliter
facio, aut cogito, caeteris omnibus salvis, solus ego peream.

Alexand: ab Alexand. lib. 5. cap. 10.
inviolably; and if they failed in the performance thereof, they desired no
more mercy or compassion to be showed unto them, then they showed unto that dog
which they then killed: so that if at any time they had failed in the
performance of such Articles, as they had agreed upon, they had a strong
conceit, that some evil would suddenly befall them; as it did that year that
Fabius profaned the rites and Ceremonies of their Faecialls, at which time
their chief City was sacked by the Gawles.


Rustic: Have the Heathenish Romans and Turks been so punctual in
observance of their engagements?


Iurid: Yes certainly, as I will show you in two memorable examples of the
Romans, and one of the Turks. Regulus, a Roman, being taken Captive by the
Carthaginians, was sent unto Rome upon this Embassy, either to procure so many
Captive Carthaginians, which the Romans had taken, to be sent home unto
Carthage for his ransom, or else he to return again: but before he took his
journey, they caused him to take an oath, that if he did not procure their
release, than then he himself should return to Carthage. Cicero lib 2. Offic.
Regulus went accordingly, and coming unto Rome he related unto the Senate the
cause of his coming; the Romans overioyed with the sight of their Regulus,
being one that had deserved well of them, granted what he desired before they
knew what his desire was; which he taking most kindly, yet refusing their
kindness, after some short stay of Congratulation with them, told them that he
had a second request unto them, which was that he might have their love and
leaves to depart from them: at which the Romans being astonished, and not so
much joyed at the first with the sight of him, as they were now grieved that he
would depart from them; would needs know of him the motives that induced him
unto it. Regulus willing to give unto them all satisfaction, told them that he
was abashed to come unto them upon so unwelcome a Message, but desired them to
excuse him for that he was sent by the Carthaginians, and he must needs go
whom the Carthaginians drove. The cause wherefore he did now leave them was,
not for any ill will he bare them, or by reason of any unkindness conceived,
but out of his Vicit amor patriae ratione valentior omni.

Omnium societatum nulla est gratior (inquit Cicero,) nulla charior quam ea
quae cum repub. est vnicuique nostrum; chari sunt parents, charlliberi,
propinqui, familiares; sed omnes omnium charitates patria vna compleza est; pro
qua quis bonus dubitet mortem oppetere, si ei sit profuturus?

Cicero lib. 1. Offic:
love and respect unto them, for that he was now grown old and full of diseases
and infirmities, and not able as formerly he had been to do them service: and
that he was but one, nor one neither, but half one: one foot being in the
grave already, and why so many captive Carthaginians should be delivered for
the ransom of one Roman, the meanest of which were better able to do them
service than he was, (which was the cause of his Embassy) he saw no reason for
it; and that they might justly tax him of his neglect of them, if he should
request so unreasonable a thing of them, and so desired them as formerly that
he might have their loves to return again: with which the Romans being yet
not well satisfied, persuaded yet further with him, that as he had ever-loved
them, so he would continue it to the last, and leave his bones with them. My
bones (alas quoth he) in them there is nothing but rottenness and
putrefaction, but that which is dearer unto me, my heart I will: but as for O
terque quaterque beazil

my bones, seeing I have given my faith to the Carthaginians, to them I must
bequeath them, and return again. When reply was made, but it was to the
Carthaginians. O! but with the Carthaginians faith is not to be violated. And
so notwithstanding all the persuasions that could be used, he returned again:
upon whose return the Carthaginians caused new kind of torments to be
inflicted upon him, cut off his eyelids, to the intent that he might not
sleep, and inflicted upon him such ineffable punishments, as no Quis funera
fando Explicet? aut possit lachrymis aequare dolores?

Virgil: Aeneid. 2.
tongue or pen is able to express. The like Roman resolution is said to be
in Plutarch. in regu^ Apopht.
Pompey, who having with some others engaged himself in a great dearth at Rome
to make provisio^ for the Citizens, being ready to hoyse up sail, there fell
out on a sudden very stormy and tempestuous winds, insomuch that they that
were with him on the shore, and they which were with him in the Ship, and were
to accompany him in the voyage, desired him to stay until the storm were
over; unto whom Pompey answered, Vt eam, non vt vivam, necesse est, needful it
is that I should go, not that I should live; for without me, Rome may well
subsist, but not without meat and drink; so in the midst of the storm, that
he might not be thought careless of his word and promise, and of what he had
undertaken, he took his voyage. Vide generalem historiam Turcarum in Amurah.
6.
Amurah, a Turk likewise, having made a truce with the King of Hungary, and
taken his oath upon his Alcaron to keep it inviolably, turned his forces
intended for Europe into the Coasts of Asia. Of which when the King of Hungary
had notice, notwithstanding his oath, by the persuasion of Julius the Popes
Legate, and other the Romish Bishops, was drawn to invade the Turks
Territories in Thracia, contrary to the league, of which when the Turk was
given to understand, he reduced his Forces forthwith into Europe again, and
set upon the Christians: where after a long Skirmish, the Turk enveighing
against the treachery of the Christians, listed up his eyes and hands and cried,
O Jesus Christ, if thou be God, as they say thou art, revenge this abuse
offered unto thy Name: and no sooner had he spoken it, the Battle being
before doubtful, but the victory fell to the Turk: the King being taken, and
his head as an Ensign of treachery being set upon a Spear, the Popes Legate
and many of his Bishops being slain with him. If Regulus a Heathen, and Amurah
a Turk, were so regular, so strict and precise, that they would not profane
the name of their Gods, invocated to witness a vow made unto their professed
enemies; with what face can a Christian stand before the Tribunal of God at
the last day, that has so often mocked and deluded him?


Rustic: Regulus in my opinion, might well have dispensed with his oath, being
made to his open and professed enemies.


Iurid: If he had been a Christian he could not; for he vowed no more then
what he might well have performed; which was either to return again, or to
send so many Captive- Carthaginians from Rome; but if he had made a vow that
had been evil in it self; such as was the vow of Math. 14. verse. 7.
Herod unto Herodias for the cutting off John Baptist head; for which both he
and she are branded with infamy, and the stigmaticall Characters remain as
yet undefaced in them; or such as King 1 Samuel 25. verse. 22.
David made for the killing of Nabal; or such as our Votaries now adays do
for the leading of a single life, choosing rather to be the Fathers of a
spurious generation, then to break the vow which they have made. In these and
the like cases, they may very well Melius est vota stultae promissionis non
implere, quam crimen admittere. Morus ironice commendat fidelitatem Herodis his
versibus.

Morus in Epigram. de Herod: and Herodiad. Illicitum juramentum non est

fail in the strict performance. The Laws of Nature and Nations teach us,
that no tie or obligation, be it never so strong, will tie a man to do a
wicked act, or any thing that is in it self mischievous; as if a man make a
solemn vow and protestation, or bind himself in an obligation to kill such a

withal, because they are against the Laws of God and men.


Rustic: Admit that Regulus should not so strictly have performed the vow which
he made to the Carthaginians: what harm or wrong could it have been unto him,
seeing that he was now at home amongst his friends, through whose importunity
and solicitation he did what he did?


Iurid: Certainly besides the horror of his conscience, which is the Maxima

greatest torment that any man can undergo, the Romans would not have endured
him, for they held him unworthy the name of a Roman, and not fit to live
amongst them that was false and perfidious, and that faith even with thieves
and robbers was to be observed, and for no respect to be violated, no not for a
Kingdom. Apud Homerum Achilles non secus ac mortem odisse inquit se cum, qui
aliud ore promit, aliud pectore claudit: and inter mendacem and perjurum nihil

Alyar they hated as death, and made no difference between a liar, swearer,
and perjured person; for he that would lie would swear, and he that would
swear would forswear, if occasion were offered. A tale-teller likewise and
rumor-rayser they could not endure; whom Plutarch in the life of Alexander in
Philotas has well set forth: As in a fury of a dreadful fight,
Their fellows being slain, or put to flight;
Poor Soldiers stand with fear of death dead stricken;
So with Antigona was Philotas taken.

Phylot as having settled his affections upon the fair and lovely Antigona a
Curtisan, whom he took Captive at the Battle in Sicilia, being desirous to
endear himself unto her, let fall some speeches tending to the dishonor of
Alexander, affirming that what was done at that Battle, was done by his Father
Parmenio and himself, and that they two kept the young man (for so he styled
Alexander) in his throne, but no sooner had Antigona taken her leave of him,
but meeting with one of her acquaintance, related unto her what Philotas had
told her, and what words he used of Alexander; and so it went from one to
another, whereby a fame was raised, which coming to the understanding of
Craterus fuit Alexand. in delitijs, Ephestionem amabat maxim, sed Crateru^
honorabat maxim^.
Craterus, he forthwith acquainted Alexander with it, who sent for Philotas,
and he for his vain and foolish babbling, received condign punishment. Such
kind of men as was this Philotas they would not endure, nor give any Credit
unto their words and testimonies: but as for Per leges Aegyptiorum perjuri

fraternity and society; for though they love the perjurie, by reason of the
benefit that comes unto them by it, yet they hate the person; for that he
which was sometimes perjured in their behalf, may undo what he has done, and
speak the truth when times serve. Solomon loathed and abhorred the Traitor
that betrayed Rhodes unto him, and in stead of his daughter whom he expected to
be given him in marriage for a reward, he caused him to be fleyed and salted,
and in derision told him, that it was not fit for a Christian to marry with a
Turk, unless he put off his old skin. (...), Paulus Aemilius lib. 1. Derebus
gest: Franc. in Clodo^a^.
Charles the fourth rewarded the Soldiers that betrayed their Lord and Master
with counterfeit coin, and being desired to deliver current money, answered,
that counterfeit coin was the proper wages for counterfeit service. The same
reward (as Paulus Aemilius reports) did Clodovaeus bestow upon them that
betrayed Cannacarius into his hands. Alexander caused Bessus that betrayed
Darius to be put to death; and Caesar would not endure to look upon Herodotus
and Achillas, that presented him the head of Pompey: and certainly, if Maenas
had cut the Cables at that time when Pompey feasted Caesar and Anthony in his
Galleys, Pompey would have rewarded him as Alexander did Bessus. It is reported
of Constantius Caesar, the Father of Constantine the Great, that he decreed
that all such Christians as would not adore his Gods, should depart from his
service; yet all those that denied their faith, he banished too, for this
reason; for that he which has been once false to God, will never be true to
men. A liar or perjured person amongst the Romans was not to be believed,
though he had spoken or sworn the truth. Vide Apologum de mendaci puero: quo
ostenditur mendaces hoc consequi, vt veru^ cum dicunt nemo credat.

Cicero lib. 2. Offic.
Quoniam qui semel est malus semper praesumitur esse malus in eodem genere
mali. For that he that has been once false is ever to be suspected in the
same kind of falsehood. Wherefore faith is aptly compared to a glass, which
being once broken, can never be repaired; or to opportunity, which once
omitted, can never be recovered: therefore if Reg^lus had stayed at Rome,
contrary to his oath, the Romans certainly would never have endured him,
though he was thereunto required; so odious and detestable were those sorts of
people in the Roman Commonwealth.


Rustic: Had the Heathens any Laws, I pray you, to punish these kind of
people: viz. liars, rumor raysers, and perjured persons?


Iurid: The Heathen Orator will tell you, that by the Laws of the Heathens,
the same Eadem paena came mendacio quam perjurio a dijs datur.

Cicero.
punishment was due to the liar as to the perjured person, and that amongst the
most barbarous people of the Heathens the Alexand: ab Alexand.

have undergone any office, but to have had his fingers and toes cut off; and as

rumor-rayser, you shall find it well set forth in the end of the life of
Nicea in Plutarch. It happened upon a time that a stranger coming into a
Barbers shop, to be disburdened of some superfluous excrements which he carried
about him, whilst was under the Barbers hands, told him of some strange
Occurrences which happened in Sicilia, which the Barber conceiving to be true,
relates the same unto the Citizens where he lived; the Citizens upon the
hearing of it make an vproare, which the Magistrate endeavoring to suppress,
would needs know of them the cause of the tumult, which they affirmed to be by
reason of some occurrences which happened in Sicilia, and being demanded to
tell where they had their intelligence, it was found that it proceeded from a
Barber; who being su^moned to appear before the Magistrate, affirmed, that
what he related he heard of a stranger in his shop; but because he could not
produce the stranger Pro mendace and Civitatis turbatore in rotam deligatus,
and diu tortus est; he had the punishment of the wheel, as a disturber of the
peace of the City, and was cruelly tortured and tormented.


Rustic: But how do these kind of people stand in the sight of God,
especially perfidious truce breakers, and false-hearted perjured persons?


Iurid: Most odious and contemptible; as is manifested in all our histories
both sacred and profane; look in the Histories of former ages, and you shall
see how miraculously God has ever punished this offense of perjurie. Diodorus
Siculus, and Macrobius speak of a religious lake in Sicilie, where the
Sicilians did use to take their oaths for the deciding of controversies; and if
they had sworn the truth, they returned without harm; but if they forswore
themselves they were drowned. And Aristotle speaks of another lake near unto
it, which is called Fons Acadinus; into which the depositions of the Witnesses
are thrown, and if they contain nothing but verity, they swim on the top
of the water; if otherwise, they sink to the bottom. And Solinus in
Collectancis rerum memorabilium.
Solinus has something of a lake in Sardinia, with the water whereof the
deponents are commanded to wash their eyes, and if they have deposed the truth,
their eyes became more clear; if false, it put out their eyes. And Diodorus
Siculus speaks of another Lake near unto Tiana, of which they that take an
oath are accustomed to drink, and if they swear the truth, it affords a sweet
and pleasant relish to the palate, and becomes nutrimentall to their bodies;
if false, it makes their bodies leprous, and so benummes them, that they are
not able to stir, but continue there, bewayling their miserable estate and
condition; the like water he reports to be in Aethiopia. Thus miraculously does
God punish this offense. Look again into the Book of God, and there you
shall see what punishment 1 Regum Cap. 21. v. 23.
Iezabel, and the rest that conspired against Naboth underwent; how the
accusers of Daniel were punished; and the Sea the history of Susanna, verse. 26.
false Witnesses that rose up against Susanna? How Saul's 2 Samuel 21. verse. 1.
posterity were punished for the breach of the league which Iosuah made with
the Gibeonites? How Genesis 49. verse. 5.
Simeon and Levi were cursed by their Father at his death, for that they
destroyed Sichem and Hamor, contrary to the Covenant and league made with them.
Look into the Ecclesiastical Histories, and there you shall see how the
Eusebius: Ecclesiast. histors. lib. 5. cap. 8.
three Witnesses that rose up against Narcissus, Bishop of Jerusalem were
punished; how according to their several wishes they received condign
punishment: three false brethren having co^spired against the good Bishop, to
the end that they might dazzle the eyes of the world, and make the world
believe, that what they had said was true, made three voluntary wishes: the
first wished, that if that which he had said were not true, that a sudden fire
might come down from heaven, and consume him; the second wished that some
extreme sickness might befall him, and like a Cankar eat out the marrow of his
bones; the third, that his eyes might fall out; and according to their wishes
it happened to them all: the first was burnt with all his possessions; the
second perished with a languishing and loathsome disease; the third perceiving
the punishment to happen to the other according to their wishes and desires,
confessed his offense, and desired pardon of the Almighty, and by reason of
his continual penetentiall tears which he shed, at length lost his eyes. So
the Bishop that fled out of fear, fearing that innocence could not have
withstood the fury of three such violent Witnesses, was sent for home again,
and restored to all his possessions. Look again into the Monkish and other
Histories, and you shall see how William Malmesb. de gestis regum Aug. lib. 2.
cap. 6. page 28.
Aelfred a Nobleman of England was miraculously punished for perjury, who
having plotted and conspired against Adelsta^e to put out his eyes, was put to
his oath to make his purgation, by reason no evident testimony could be made
thereof, who for that he took an Oath contrary to the truth and his
conscience, he fell down presently, and within three days dyed. You shall see
again how H. Hi^nting d^ lib. 2. p. 210. Precatio Godwin^. Si deus caeli verax,
and justus, hoc panis frustulum concedat ne guttur pertranseat, si vnquam te
prodere cogitaverim; Deus autem (vt est in historia) audivit vocem proditoris,

Earl Godwin, Father to King Harold, who having conspired the untimely death
of King Edward the Confessor, denied it with many protestations, being charged
therewith; but at one time above the rest more seriously and solemnly wished,
that the bread which he had in his hand might be his last, if ever he had any
such thought; and as he wished, so it befell him; for in the eating of it he
was choked. Look into Plutarch, and you shall see how Plutarch. in Regum
Apophtheg:
Cleomenes was punished for the breach of the Truce which he made with the men
of Argyers. Cleomenes having made a Truce with the men of Argyers for seven
days, set upon them in the night, and slew many of them, and being reproved
for doing so, answered that he made a Truce but for seven days; but he
escaped not unpunished; for as the Story says, assayling of the City, he had
a most shameful and disgraceful repulse by the women, which so perplexed him,
that he fell mad, and ripped up his own bowels. Look again into Plutarch, and
you shall see how Alexander Ecclipsed the glory of all his Enterprises by
putting of the poor Indians to death, See Philip Commin: how the Duke of
Bourbon was punished in his house for delivering up of the Constable of France
unto the King, after he had given him safe conduct.

Lib. 4. cap. 13.
contrary to his promise, who submitted themselves unto him. So odious have
Truce Breakers and perjured persons been ever in the sight of God.


Rustic: The offenses of lying, rumor-raysing, and perjurie, being offenses of
so high a nature; how comes it to pass, that we have no Laws amongst our
selves to punish them?


Iurisp: Sir, you are mistaken, we have Laws which punish them in a high
degree, though not in so high a degree, as did the Laws made in the days of
our forefathers and progenitors.


Rustic: What Law is there, I pray you, to punish a rumor-rayser, and how were
they punished in the days of our progenitors?


Iurisp: By the Ancient Qui falsos rumores in vulgus sparge^diautor est, lingua
ei praecisa erit, nisi capitis aestimatione vult redimere, per leges Alured:
idem supplicium in coldem, per leges Edgari. Vid. Lam. Sax. ^eg.
Laws of England, if any one had been the Author of any false rumor, his
tongue was to have been cut out, unless he would have redeemed it with the
price of his head. The Laws of England now in force, have provided punishments
which have a resemblance unto the punishments spoken of in the life of Nicea,
which were inflicted upon the Barber by a See the Stat. of Westminster 1. cap. 33.
Statute Law made in the days of King Edward the first; If any one shall raise
any rumor whereby discord and dissension shall grow between the King his
people and Nobles, he that does raise the same shall be kept in prison until
he has brought him forth that did speak the same. In the days of King
Richard the 2. there were See the Stat. 2. Rich. 2. cap. 11.
Laws made, that if any one should counterfeit any false News, lies, or tales
of any Prelates, Dukes, Earls, Barons, or other Nobles of the Realm, or of
the Chauncelor, Treasurer, Clerk of the privy seal, Justice of one bench or
other, the great Officers of the Realm, which by the said Lords were never
spoken nor thought of, whereby debate may arise between the Lords and Commons,
and thereby great mischief incur unto the Realm, he was to undergo such
punishments as was provided by the Statute made before in the days of King
Edward the first; and to endure such further punishments as the Lords in their
discretions should think fit; as by another See the Stat. of 12. R. 2. cap. 11.
Statute made in the said Kings Reign may appear. So do the Laws of the
Kingdom where you live punish rumor-raysers.


Rustic: But how do the Laws of our Kingdom punish perjured persons?

The Sea the Stat. of 5. Eliz. Per antiquas leges Aug^a si quis jufiurandum
violaverit, fides ei in posterum non fuit adhibenda, verum in Ordalium adiu
dicandus. Vid. Lam. in priscis Angl leg. inter leges Edw: Idem supplicium per
legem Canuti, and per legem Edw: and Guthlemi; mulierculae perjuriosae a
finibus regni relegantur.

Vid. Lamb. Apud Persas lingua magis castigabatur, quam vllum probrum.

Curtius.
Statute-Lawes of the Kingdom of England do thus punish them; as they have
endeavored as much as in them lie, to corrupt the Judge that decides
Controversies, and to infringe the bond that unites and ties man to man, so as
an enemy to mankind does the Law behold them; for after that she has branded
them for perjured persons, and burdened them with a fine more heavy than
their shoulders will well bear, she sequesters them by imprisonment, as not
fit to partake of humane society, and disables their testimonies in all other
cases whatsoever. So do the Laws of our Kingdom punish perjurie.


Rustic: I pray you resolve me this doubt, do the Statute-Lawes punish all
false Witnesses alike, making no difference between a Witness whose
testimony tends only to the taking away of the goods or good name of a man,
and a Witness whose testimony tends as well to the life as liuelihood of him.


Iurid: Certainly, in both Cases the punishment is but pecuniary and
corporal, yet more or less according to the nature and quality of the
offense; for if a See the Stat. of the fifth year of Queen Elizabeth.
false testimony be used in any Cause depending before the Kings Justices in
any of his Highness Courts of Record at Westminster. be it by Writ, Action, Bill,
Information, or in any Leets, view of Frankpledge, Law-day or ancient Demesne
Court, Hundred, Court Baron, or in the Court of Stanneries in Devonshire or
Cornwall, for any Lands or Tenements, Goods or Chattels, the punishment is
certain, that is to say, forty pounds against a suborner and procurer, and
twenty pounds where no subornation is, if he has wherewithal to satisfy; if
not then imprisonment for half a year, without bail or mainprise, and to
stand upon the Pillorie for half an hour, within the Market-Towne where the
offense was committed, or in some Town near adjoining; but if it be in Case
of Confederacy or Conspiracy, where the life of a man is questioned, then the
punishment is more or less, according to the nature and quality of the
offense; as the Lords in their discretions shall think meet and convenient.


Rust: Give me leave, I pray you, to expostulate a little with you; how can a
pecuniary punishment be in any degree aequivalent to the nature of the offense,
which tends to the taking away of the life of a man; and how comes it to
pass, that the intent in some cases shall be punished with death, when it
ex^ends no further then to the taking away of the goods of a man; and in other
Cases when it extends to the taking away of his life, it shall be punished but
with a pecuniary and corporal punishment. As for example; If a man have an
intent to rob a dwelling house, and pursue it so far as to break down a wall,
though he take nothing away, yet if his felonious intent do appear by the
remoovall of goods out of their places, and packing them together, making them
fit for portage, he shall undergo the same punishment as he should have done
if so be he had taken them away: but if a man shall suborne two Witnesses to
depose a thing which trencheth to the life of a third person, though this
subornation, plot, and Conspiracy be proved by Confession of the party, or
otherwise, yet the offender shall escape with a pecuniary and corporal
punishment. By the Law of God such a Witness was punished with death; Lex
Taelionis fuit inducta a Pythagoreis ex authoritate Rhadamanthi, qui inter
caeteras leges hanc tulit. Si quis quod fecit patiatur, jus erit aequum.
Aristos. lib. 5. de iure Talionis. Oculus pro oculo, dens pro dente, Deuteronomy.

Lex Talionis was put in execution, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
And as well by the Vide Stat. de Ann. 37. Edw: 3. cap. 18.
Laws of England made in the days of King Edw: the 3. as by the By the Laws
of Scotland, he that accuses another of treason, who is acquitted, commits
treason. 1^. Stat. Scot. 11. Parliam. Iac: 6^. cap. 49.

Laws of Scotland made in the days of King James the sixth; False accusers
were punished with the same punishment as they should have been that were
accused, if the accusation had been true.


Iurid: Certainly, I know no reason, why the one should live, and the other
dye, unless it were to that end and purpose, as Sueton: i^ Nerone 34. Corn^l:
Tacit. lib. 14. cap. 3.
Nero was suffered to live that his punishment might be the greater, who after
the murdering of his Mother, was continually terrified with the apparition of
her Ghost, and with conceits that the furies persecuted him with burning
torches; or to that end and purpose as Phil: Commin: lib. 7. c 11.
Alphonsus King of Naples was suffered to live, who having unjustly murdered
four and twenty of his Barons, could never afterward sleep quietly, but
ever cried in the night, that he heard the Frenchmen coming, and the trees
and stones sounded France: or to that end and purpose, as Sir Thomas More in
Ri. 3. page 69.
Richard the 3. was suffered to live, who never enjoyed himself after the
murder of his Nephews: of whom Sir Tho: More thus writes. I have heard
(says he) by such as were secret with his Chamberers, that after this
abominable deed done, he never had quiet in his mind, he never thought
himself sure; when he went abroad, his eyes whirled about, and his body was
privily fenced, his hand ever on his dagger: his countenance in manner as if he
had been always ready to strike; he took no rest at nights, lay long waking
and musing, so wearied with care and watching, rather slumbered than slept;
troubled with fearful dreams, suddenly sometimes started up, leapt out of
his bed, and ran about the Chamber, and so his restles heart was tossed and
tumbled with a tedious impression and stormy remembrance of his abominable
deed: or unless it were for that end and purpose, as they were suffered to
live in the days of William the Conqueror, when the punishment in no case was
Guilielmus Conquestor inter caeteras leges hanc tulit, vt ne quis occidatur,

proditionis suae. Vid. Lamb. interleges Guil. Conquest.
Capital; yet more terrible than death, the punishment sometimes being the
loss of a hand, sometimes of a leg, sometimes of every member of the body;
Ita quod truncus solum remaneat in signum nequitiae, according to the quality
of the offense. I say, I know no reason, unless for these reasons they were
suffered to live. And therefore I have ever been of opinion, that if in any
case in the case of Susanna, and Phoebus his wife, Si quis quae fecit patitur
justissima paena est.
-- neque lex est iustiorvlla,
Quam necis artifices art perire sua.
Ovid. 1. De Art Aman. Expectes eadem quae nobis feceris (Albi)
Nam quem tu laedis, te ferit ille libens.

Lex Talionis should be put in execution, and have often wished that some good
Law were made to punish false Witnesses by the example of the Crow, which
Chawcer in a few Verses has well remembered. Beware my Son, be no Author new,
Of Rebus in humanis magna est doctrina tacere.
Magnu^ hoc ad requie^ pharmacon invenies.

tidings be they false or true;
Wheresoever thou come among high or low,
Keep well thy tongue, and think of the Crow.



Rustic: You have given me good satisfaction hitherto, I pray you go on unto
the next, which is the last Law in the Catalogue, and acquaint me (as you have
done of the former) what Laws are thence derived.


Iurid. I will therein satisfy you. And first I will show you what
Covetousness is; then how unto it as the springs unto the fountain, all
mischiefs and inconveniences in a Commonwealth have relation; how from it
arise discords and dissentions, factions and seditions, tumults and
insurrections; how it subverteth the Laws of God and nature; how it makes a
man miserable both in life and death; how the poor man that lives contentedly
with a little, is in better state than the rich covetous man; then, how the
wi^est of the Heathens did abhor it, and how the wisest of Kings prayed
against it; and lastly, what Laws have been made to restrain the unbridled
affections of covetousness and intemperate persons; and so conclude for this
time. You shall understand, that Avaritia quae Graece (...) dicitur, non in
solo argento vel nummis, sed in omnibus rebus quae immoderate capiuntur
intelligenda est. Vbicunque omnino plus vult quisque quam sa^ est.

August. Ambitious hunting after honors, and worldly goods, were the causes of
the civil Wars between the 2 houses of York and Lancaster.

See Philip Commin: lib. 1. cap. 7.
Covetousness is nothing else but a thirsty and greedy desire after any thing
which is prohibited; not of gold alone, sed vbicunque plus vult quisque quam
sat est, but wheresoever any one desires more than enough of any thing; which
the Ancients have aptly termed radix and scaturigo malorum, the root and
cause of all mischiefs in a Commonwealth; for what evil is there in Court or
Country, that has not this for an original? what factions are there in City
or society, that has not this for a beginning? is it not this that disturbes
both Sea and Land, Church and Commonwealth, that makes the son to wish his
Father in his grave defore his time? that makes the nearest and dearest friends
fall foul one upon another? Pylades upon Orestes, and Damon upon Pythias? Nee

inexplebilis fames, of their too much hungring and thirsting after greatness;
they were but two, but too many by two; for had they perished in the womb, or
dyed as soon as they were borne, it had been happy for the Roman State, how
many thousand harmless souls suffered, to satisfy the pride of their
hearts, and ambitious thoughts? How did the streets stream with blood, and the
poor Mothers mourn and lament to see their babes and sucklings taken from
their breasts, and in their sight exposed to the fury of the beasts, before
they were able to measure the ground with their pases? How did the poor
Fathers sometimes lay violent hands upon themselves, sometimes upon their
children, and all to prevent the fury of the enemy? How were the Squallida stat

Market places, overgrowne with Moss and grass, thorns and briars? how was
the mistress of the world forlorn and become like an Owl in the Desert? It is
reported by the Roman. Writers, that during the last ten years Wars
between Marius and Sylla, were slain one Oros. lib. 5. cap. 22. Eutrop. lib.

days. And besides those that were slain by his Watchword, which was that it
should be a sufficient Warrant to kill a man of quality, Cui fatalem illam

Skeleton of K: Henry the 4. The Gymnosophists, upon whom Alexander doated so
much, that he promised to give them whatsoever they would demand; being
desirous to beat him from that greedy desire of his of compassing the world,
demanded of him immortality. Unto whom Alexander answered, that they demanded
a thing which was not in his power to give, he was a mortal man, and that
immortality was proper unto the Gods to give, and not unto men. Which when the
Gymnosophists heard, they replied, If thou be a mortal man, as thou say
thou art, why are thy thoughts so infinite and boundless, that nothing but the
world will satisfy thee? Macedone is a fair possession, and thy forefathers
lived contentedly with it. Why should thou inherit their possessions, and
not their virtues? Remember that thou art a man, and that nature is contented
with a little. When Alexander afterward had compassed the world, and by reason
of his victorious enterprises set himself on high, and would be called a God,
the Curt. lib. 7.
Scythian Ambassadors set upon him, and told him, if thou be a God, as thou
say thou art, remember thy self to be so; the Gods do no wrong, they give
and take naught from any man. If Alexander could have added years to his life,
as he did Kingdoms to his possessions, he might well have styled himself to
have been a God; or if he could but have assured himself to have attained to
the age of his Forefathers, Adam, Methuselach, or any of the Patriarchs that
lived so long in the time of the old world; so that he might have enjoyed what
he attained unto with such perils and dangers, he might have had some cause to
have gloried and triumphed in his many victories and Conquests, but seeing that

Monopolized no Commodities, nor debarred him of any privileges; he has done

true judgment it is not so. It is true, better attendance and more observance
he has, but it is better for him to be without them; for to what end do they
wait upon him? Certainly, to none other, than the Crows wait upon a Carriers
Hackney, or Iockys Palfry, that lies gasping for breath upon the road; that
they may pull out his eyes, and prey upon him. One waits upon him for Chremes
his sake, and when he is ready to go out of the world, pulls him back again,
and wishes him to remember his old Uncle Chremes, that has been beaten with
storms and tempests, with crosses and losses in the world. Another attends him
for Pasibulaes sake, and cries remember, O remember Pasibula the fair
Pasibula, your old uncle Chremes his daughter, that is come to woman's estate,
and wants a portion to prefer her in marriage: a third attends for Davus his
sake, and calls upon him to remember Davus, his old servant Davus, that spent
his youth and his best days in his service, and now being old wants succor
and relief: a fourth attends to find a fit opportunity to speak for
himself: every man's end and aim is to get a fleece from him: no man waits
upon him for Gods sake, or for any love they bear unto him. But is it so with
the poor man? No; he is never troubled with any such remembrancers, when death
calls him, and sickness like unto Philips Page, summons him with a Memento
mori, he has a free passage without disturbance. We read in histories, that
it is a Custom in some Mos Aegyptiorum suit, vt illi de quibus sumenda erat

society of him whom he never saw; but either on the highway, or in a Common
Inn, or in the Marketplace; but to leave a familiar bosom friend hopeless
to see him again; for Demas to leave this present world, or Dives his Mammon,
and to be sequestered into a dungeon of darkness and misery, there to remain
throughout all eternity, that is torture and torment: and this is the Case of
the covetous man, for what can that man expect when he dies, that never adored

that miserable in his life, miserable in his death, miserable in his body,
miserable in his soul, and miserable in his possessions, upon which he so much
doated, is the covetous man; for when death comes, he knows not what to do
with it, keep it he cannot, and leave it he will not, feign would he carry it
along with him, but his Conscience tells him that in justice he is bound to
leave it behind him, to make satisfaction for the many wrongs and injuries he
has committed; feign would he then live to make satisfaction, but the sentence
of death being past, dye he must, feign would he then dye, but dye he cannot;
for on the one side stands the husbandman and disturbes him, calling upon him
for satisfaction for the wrong done unto him by depopulating of the Village
wherein he lived: on the other side stands the Citizen and disturbes him,
calling upon him for satisfaction for the wrong done unto him, for Engrossing
of the Commodities whereby he was accustomed to get his living, round about him
stand the poor, the fatherless and the widows, calling upon him for
satisfaction for the wrong done unto them; so standing distracted as it were,
between life and death, at length death seizes upon him, and carries him out
of the flame into the fire, into an Avaritiam et rapinam redarguit August:

materials for the disease to feed upon; and courage to the Current, to run
more swiftly: the wound putrifies and corrupts within, whilst it is stubbered
over, and made fair to the eye only: and this is the Case of the Covetous
man. The other likewise, he betakes himself to his accustomed diet, which is
either to eat nothing with Nullo modo mihi placet bis in die comedere, and

Galen and Hippocrates, and which of these two is the happier man, judge you.


Rustic: Certainly, if I be Judge, I must adjudge as all our Country does
(notwithstanding any thing you have said to the contrary) the rich man to be
the more happy man, for that every where, both in Country and City, he is
cleped by the name of a good man, and is honored and reverenced, when the poor
man is neglected and despised; and for evident demonstration, I will tell you
what I saw with mine eyes. Not long since being in the City, it was my chance
to come into a Barbers Shop, where I beheld two men attending the Barber to
have his help for the cutting off their hair; the one was rich, and had his
purse full of Crowns, the other poor, and had not a penny in his purse; the
Barber entertained them both, but with a great deal of difference, he that had
the Crowns, had the finest linen, the purest water, the sweetest balls, the
choycest powders, the sharpest rasor, the keenest sissers, and as much of his
art as he could afford him; but he that came for Gods sake, had no other
linen, than what he carried about him, his own shirt to wipe his hands; no
other water than what issued out of the Barbers mouth, he spat on his face, and
with that water did he shave his hair, and in stead of a rasor did he use a
kind of a saw, which did rather deglubere than tondere. So shaved him that ad
singulos tractus lachrymae exoculis vbertim manabant; that water issued out of
his eyes at every drawing of his hand. In so much, that a little dog that had
been beaten in the streets, coming into the shop for refuge, the poor man
thinking that he had shaved the dog as he had done him, because he cried so,
demanded, O canis number tu rasus es ob dei timorem, alas poor dog, have thou
been shaven too? For if he had been a dog, he could not have been used worse
than he was used. So that in my opinion, it is an easy matter to judge which
is the more happy man, the rich man or the poor.


Iurisp: The man you speak of Sir, was a true Odi hortulanum qui ab radice
olera abscindit: odi hominem qui pennas ita incidit, vt nequeant renasci.

Lips: lib. 4. Pol.
Cut-throate, and a Jew, no Barber, and I must confess, amongst the Jewish
fraternity in every place, Judas with his bag, is better esteemed than Peter
that had neither gold nor silver. It is the familiar language I know of that
fraternity, to confound virtue and riches. He is a good man, says the Cicero
saepe Socraticam exaggerat ironiam: viri boni in populo nuncupantur qui sunt
divites, etsi vitijs omnibus inquinati sunt. Pet. Orat. de avaris. vitanda.
Broker, when he means a rich man. But these men never knew where goodness
dwelt. Our forefathers in their Hierogliphicks, did usually picture out the way
unto the Temple of honor, to be by the Temple of virtue; but this viperous
generation has dammed up this way, and found out another way. O Cives, Cives,
quaerenda pecunia primum est,
Virtus post nummos.


The golden way is now the way that leads unto the Temple of honor.


Rustic: Certainly, the fraternity of Brokers, as you term them, are in the
right; for in most parts of our Country, if a man have no Non me praeterie

amicos, ad contubernales: quantum sit pe^uniae, tantum est nobilitat^s and

money, let him be as just as Aristides, as learned as Homer, as valiant as
Hector, as wise as Solomon, yet we value him not. Quantum quisque sua nammorum

wherefore if at any time, we mean to overcome an enemy in the field, we arm
our selves with Argenteis pugna telis, ac omnia vinces.
silver weapons, which have this power in them to pierce and make way through
any Armor, be it Pistol, Musket, or Cannon-proofe, and to vanquish our
enemies, though they do exceed us in multitude; as the French did the English
at the Battle of Poytiers and Cressey; by drawing them unto us, as the Sun
does the vapors, and the fire the moisture. Therefore if at any time we
besiege a City, or any Hold or Fortress, if we can but send an Omnia Castella

Ass laden with gold into it, it will make way, though the gates be of iron,
and the walls of brass. So that in the time of war we are confident, there
is no such weapon as money is, what ever it be in the time of peace.


Iurid: It is an excellent weapon in the time of war I must confess, and
that Alexander aurum and argentum raro cuiquam, nisi militibus dedit. Lamprid.
in Alexand.
Alexander knew well, who would at no time part with his ready money, but unto
his Soldiers: but how many have we heard of in the time of peace, whom their
riches have caused to have been made fools upon record; who otherwise might
have p^st for as wise men as their neighbors. How many have we heard of, whom
their estates have brought into misery and confusion, and made their own
Children become their butchers and executioners? Do we not read of a Citizen
of Venice, who being banished for a misdemeanor, and Proclamation made, that
whosoever could bring his head, should have his estate, his son only being
made privy where he made his abode, to gain his estate, became his
executioner? Do we not read of Vislar, a King of Gothland, who by his greedy
Covetousness, having heapt up an abundance of riches, and for that cause being
had in Contempt of all men, that his sons thinking he had lived too long,
seized upon his treasure, set fire upon his house, and burnt him, with all his
family? Do we not read that it was Croesus great revenue that set Cyrus
teeth on edge, and made his body indefatigable, until he had subdued him? Do
we not read, that it was Crassus proud speeches (being the greatest man of
wealth in his time) that no man was worthy to be accounted rich, unless with
his proper goods he could maintain an Army; that drew the Parthians upon him,
and made them never to give him over, until they had overcome him, and filled
his mouth with gold, after which he so much thirsted? Do we not read again,
that it was the Covetousness of the Jews, that caused twenty thousand of
them at a siege of Jerusalem under Vespasian, to have their bowels ripped up,
and be massacred? And do we not read in Diodorus Siculus, of the Citizens
inhabiting the Islands in the Spanish Seas, to have cast all their treasures
into the Seas, fearing they might be motives to draw a foreign enemy upon
them, or to make them fall foul one upon another? So that you see, the golden
way is not always the surest and safest way.


Rustic: Though some have perished in that way, and by their greedy
Covetousness, have pulled their houses upon their heads, yet, I hope, you will
not blame that man that having a long journey to go, makes some provision to
relieve him in his journey, and relyeth not wholly upon fortune.


Iurisp: Mistake me not. I condemn him not; for as I hate to see an old man
covetous, so I love to see a young man provident. I cannot but commend him, who
having a journey to go, makes provision to succor him in his journey: but for
him that is at his journeyes end: for an De senili avaritia quid efficatius

Rustic: Sir, what would you have a man do, or how would you have him live?


Iurid: Go to Theol: and he will tell you; it would be deemed presumption in
me to undertake such a task: Yet I will tell you freely, what I have heard him
say; If thou be a head of the Church, live like thy self, as God has placed
thee in degree above others, so be thou in thy conversation, a light and lamp
unto others; keep Perta patens ^sto, nulli claudaris honesto, scripsit quidam

thy duty so to do; for so much is enjoined thee by the general Councels, and

man, live thou like thy self, be not so eager after the poor vanities of the
world, as if thou were borne to no other end or purpose, but to rake and scrape
together; nor yet so retire thy self, as if thou were borne only to eat,

show the fruit thereof in thy life and conversation: Deserts and solitary
places are provided for the Savages, and the Cloisters for Maxima virtutis laus

Monks and Friars; but for men of action, there are Cities and Villages
provided. It was a good and holy resolution of Hilarion: Hilarion having cast
out a legion of devils by the spirit of God out of Orion, Orion to show his
thankfulness unto him, woulds needs have rewarded him with some gratuities,
which Hilarion perceiving, in some indignation asked him, whether he never read
or heard what befell Gehezi? and when Orion still pressed him to accept of his
gift, he made him this further answer; Why should I that have Nemo negligens
in re sua, praesumitur diligens in re aliena.
left mine own, accept of yours: and when a third time, he pressed him to
accept of it, and to give it to the poor; he answered, who should better know
how to dispose of yours, than your self, and who should better know who had
most need than you, who walk through the high ways, and Cities, and
Villages; as for my self, I live in a Cloister, and what I do I must do by
others; but you may make your own eyes your overseers. This was a holy
resolution, and did well become this good man, because he was a man of God, and
had sequestered himself from the affairs of the world: but for a secular man,
that should be a man of employment, to sequester himself from the affairs of
the world, and to sit Sunning himself with the Cynicke all his life time, I
cannot commend it in him. Diogenes was named by the name of a dog, and well he
deserved it, because he would not endure the company of men. The sentence of
Jupiter was just upon the snayle, when Jupiter had courteously invited the
snayle, with the rest of the creatures to a feast, when all other came, the
snayle stayed at home; which Jupiter taking ill, would needs know wherefore he
came not with the rest of his neighbors: unto whom the snayle returned this
Answer; Novi, Jupiter, nusquam gentium delicias optabiliores, quam domi;
certainly, my meat never rellisheth so well with me, as it does at home: but
he received a condign punishment for his careless neglect, because he loved
home so well, his punishment was that he should never depart from home, but
should carry his house upon his back. It was an unseemly answer which
Diogenes gave to Alexander, when Alexander was pleased to stoop so low as to
come unto him, and to tell him, that he understood he was in want, and that he
was come to supply his necessities; he had not the manners to thank him, but
expostulates the Case with him, whether of the two wanted most, he that wanted
but a Vter nostrum plu^ eget? ego, qui vltra peram nil desidero, aut tu qui non
es co^tentus paterno regno?
scrip or sachell, or he that wanted Countries or Kingdoms? Tyanaeus might
well have accepted the gift which Vespasian sent unto him, without any
disparagement, and forborne to have given that Answer unto him which he did,
which was, that he would be pleased to turn his Courtesies another way, upon
the greedy and covetous, that looked after such things, as for himself he had
enough, and looked after no more. For as to look after every thing is greedy
Covetousness; so to look after nothing is careless wretchedness: our
desires therefore and affections, should be guided by the rules of reason and
discretion; if they be dull, they should be quickened and rowsed up with the
thought of penury and necessity; if they be too free, they should be curbed
and kept in with the thought of shame and ignominy; for as he cannot be but a
poor man, and fall into misery, that having nothing cares for nothing; so he
cannot be but a dishonest man, that having all things is contented with
nothing: for him that has but a little to refuse a reward from him that has
more, and can better spare it than he want it, it will be accounted folly or
arrogancy in him; but for him that has enough, to be catching and snatching
from him that has not, it will be accounted base covetousness and cruelty in
him. An example of abstinence in this kind we may take from Tamerlaine
without disparagement; Tamerlaine being told that a Countryman within his
Territories had found much treasure, he caused the same to be brought unto him,
which he perusing and finding by the effigies and inscription, that it was the
Coin belonging to the Romans, and not the proper Coin of his Country, he
caused the same to be delivered back again; saying, What God had sent unto
him, he would not take from him: the poor man had need of it, and therefore
was it given him. The like patterns may we take from diverse others. Plutarch.
in Dionysio.
When Dionysius understood of a great rich man that had much treasure, and put
it to no other use than the Anacharsis olim site de Athenicusibus dixit;
nummis cos vti duntaxat ad numerandum.
Athenians did, he caused his house to be ransackt, and a great part of his
treasure to be taken from him; which when the rich man saw, he was at his wits
end, and being desirous to know what offense he had committed that he should be
so used; it was told him, that Dionysius took it ill that he should hord up
his treasure, and put it to no use, he having daily occasion to use it: which
when the rich man heard, fearing the rest might go the same way, he began to
bestirre him, to buy and sell, trade and traffic, and no man was then more
active than he; of which when Dionysius was given to understand, he sent him
his treasure back again, and withal sent him word, that it was not his money
which he looked after, but to let him know, that money was therefore Coined that
it might be used, and that silver and gold does loose its luster and beauty
when it is horded up. Gueverra.
Philip of Macedone having overcome the Athenians, one night after Supper asked
this question of the wise men that attended him, what they thought to be the
greatest thing in the world; one answered, the water, because a man may see
more of that than of any other thing; another answered, the Sun, because it
did enlighten both heaven and earth; a third, the mountain Olympus, because it
did extend itself above the Clouds; a fourth, the Giant Atlas, upon whose
sepulcher the fearful Mountain Aetna was founded; a fifth, the Poet Homer,
who was so much honored both in his life and death, that seven Cities waged
war for his bones a long time, as sacred relics; but the wisest of them all
concluded, that animus magna despiciens, a mind despising the world, and the
vanities thereof, is the greatest of all. Gueverra.
Plato who had been in his youth an active and stirring man in the world, and
was experienced as well in mechanical trades and occupations, as in civil and
military government, being requested by a familiar friend of his, to tell him
in what Course of life he found the greatest contentment, gave him this answer
in effect; not in coveting after honors and preferments, because they are
accompanied with perils and dangers, not in gathering riches and treasures,
because they are attended with cares and fears, not in pleasures and vain
delights, because they quickly vanish and fade away. Ego nunquam tam been
contentus fui, quam eo tempore quo negotijs civilibus relictis ad libros meos
veluti bonos socios vitae meae reverti, I never received so much contentment in
any thing as in looking over my Books in my study. Charles the fifth, a
puissant and a mighty Prince, of whose magnanimity the Antipodes were
sensible, having past the blustering time of his youth, and composed all the
differences between him and Francis the first, contemplating the vanity of the
world, forsook all, In the year 1565. on the 20 th of October. Charles the
fifth resigned the Kingdom of Spain to Philip his son, with great Ceremony
at Brussell. The year following, on the 7 th of September. he resigned his
Empire to Ferdinand his brother, and betook himself to a Monastery near to
Placentia, in the Province of Estremadura.
resigned his Kingdom to Philip his son, and his Empire to his brother
Ferdinand, and betook himself to a Cloister, taking four servants only
along with him, to wait upon him. Aristarchus, a man of great account among
the Thebanes, was used to say, Quid optes, aut quid fugias nescis, ita ludit
tempus; What a man should desire, or what a man should eschew, he knew not,
times were so fickle, and therefore his resolution was, if he could but get a
little meat and drink, and a few Clothes, he would be therewith content.
Dioclesian and Maximinian, brothers rather than Copartners in the Empire, so
lovingly did they live and rule together, voluntarily laid down their Crowns
both in a day, and betook themselves to private lives. The Plutarch. in Solome.
seven wisemen of Greece, one after another refused the golden Table that was
taken up by the Fishermen of Coo in Milesia: the Case was thus; a certain man
having bought the next draught that should be taken up by the Fishermen; it
fell out, that in the draught there was a golden Table taken up, and to whom it
should belong, grew a question: the Fishermen pretended that it did belong to
them, for that they affirmed they sold but the Fish that should be taken; the
buyer pretended that it did belong to him, for that he affirmed he bought
whatsoever should be taken in the next draught: whereupon by Consent the matter
was referred to Apollo to be decided; who to put them both out of strife did
adjudge it to the wisest man of Greece, and so by a general Consent it was
given to Thales, but Thales would none of it, but put it off to Bias, Bias
refused it, and put it off to Pyttacus, Pyttacus to another, and he to another,
until at length it came to Solon, Solon resigned it to Apollo, and desired him
to dispose of it to some other; for that he took no pleasure in it. Omnia

feasts did not consist of variety of dishes, but of variety of dainties; and
happy was that man that could be admitted thereunto; there was no greedy
Philoxenus, that to please himself would displease his neighbor; nor no man
there did eat to please his palate; every man's desires were to have his ears
more expanse, that he might hear more, and his memory more strong, that he
might bear away more; there were never two hands in a dish, nor two tongues
walking together, whatsoever was spoken was spoken without interruption, and no
man would proffer to begin before the first had made an end, or to disturb
the speaker: merry they would be often and jesting, but their jests were
without offense, Semper haec ingenuis libertas permissa est, vt in commune

elegant, facetious, and void of scurrilities, obscaenities, and effeminate
ribaldry; invectiues were not heard of amongst them, unless they met with
oppression, extortion, bribery, corruption, and the like. These vices they
lanct to the depth: and Invenall was not so jerking as they were then. These
feasts were instituted for the Continuance of friendship and familiarity
between them, and in requital of Courtesies which past between each other,
and the guests were regularly sophi and philosophi, sober, discreet, wise men,
no combibones, por-Companions, rumor raysers, or tale-tellers were hitherto
admitted; but if they could fill up the music, bear a part in the Consort,
and end a Comedy with some witty Apophthegme and Conceit, they were welcome
guests: their Entertainments generally were such as King Edward the third gave
to Sir At the taking of Callis the King was stricken twice upon his knees by
this Knight, but in the end the King took him and diverse other Knights
prisoners, and beyond his expectation most royally feasted him, and graciously
set him at liberty, and gave him a Chaplet beset with pearls from his own
head, by which his clemen^ie he drow his very enemies unto him.

Feasts, were wisdom, temperance, justice, fortitude, and the like. Of which
every one tasted, yet seldom or never but of one dish at one time. Sometimes
wisdom was preferred, upon which every one fed liberally, as upon a receipt
as could in a sort antidate their days, and give them an essence and being
with the holy Patriarchs, Prophets, and Evangelists, with the reverend Fathers
and Doctors of the Church, and with the learned Naturalists and Moralists of
the world, that were departed in peace to their graves long before their great
Grandfathers were borne; by telling them how they lived, and how they dyed;
that by their examples they might prudently husband the time present; amend and
reform what had been amiss in times past, and carefully provide for the time
to come. Sometimes Temperance was preferred, upon which every one tasted
liberally likewise, as upon a Cordial that could add years to their lives,
and prolong their days; unto which every man's purse would not Cuiuslibet edere
e^ bibere est, sed cum modo et mensura id paucorum est.
extend. Sometimes Justice was preferred, which they did compare for goodness
unto the Sun in the firmament, unto the soul in the body, to the rule of
life, affirming there was no such Current to water a dry and thirsty land, no
such bond to unite and tie man to man as this was, without which no Quid s^nt
regna nisi latrocinia remota justitia, quae est legum effectus.

City, society, or Commonwealth could subsist. Sometimes Fortitude was
preferred, which they did compare unto a Mineral, more sovereign than that
aurum potabile, of which the Paracelsians make so much use of, that in times of
greatest danger can afford them ease and comfort, animating them patie^tly and
courageously to undergo that which they could not necessarily and conveniently
avoid. Non inuerse Consilium, cave ne cui haec dixeris; nam omne arcanum

Epaminondas, that he never knew any that knew so much and spoke so little.


Secrecy likewise they highly esteemed, especially in things agreed upon at
their solemn feasts, for the good and welfare of their Cities; they knew well
that a little vent in a vessel is able to deade^ the strongest wine; a little
hole is enough to drown the mightiest Ship; and a babbling tongue able to
overthrow the greatest designs. Wherefore in matters agreed upon at their
solemn meetings, they were as secret as Peter King of Arragon, who being
demanded by Pope Martin the 4th, what he meant to do with that great Fleet he
had provided, answered that if he did but know his shirt did know it, he would
cast it off. Unity and amity most necessary in a Commonwealth:

Plutarch, in Solone. Non sic excubiae nec circumstantia tela,

Quam tutatur amor Claud, Hoc eleganter exprimit Scilurus in fasciculo
jaculorum. Scilurus, qui filios relinquebat octoginta, cum mortivicinus esset,

possit nemo, ipse iacula singula extrahens, omnia co^treg^t; docens illos, si
co^cordes essent, permansuros validos, imbecilles evasuros fi essent dissociati
and distracti.

Plut. in regum Aphyhibeg. Cum pugnant singuli, vincuntur omnes.

Tacit.
Unity and amity likewise they much esteemed, and supposed their Cities never
to be better fortified, than when the people were at unity amongst themselves.
Wherefore if any one had been contentious, they did esteem him as an alien,
not as a Citizen, and studied how to disburden their Cities of him; they knew
well, that one scabbie sheep in a flock, is able to do more harm to those
that are whole, than twenty Shepherds could do good to the diseased; that
one infected man in a pestilentiall sickness, was able to do more hurt to
those that were sound, than the whole College of Physicians could do good to
those that were infected; that one ill-affected member in a City, that knew
the secrets and private passages thereof, was able to do more harm unto it,
than the whole Council could do good. Wherefore if they could not reclaim
such a one, they endeavored by all means to remove him. Sometimes liberality
and affability were preferred, which they did commend as See the effects of
liberality, excellently set forth by Chawcer in his Book entitled the Romant
of Rose.

advice and Counsel was preferred, which they did compare unto Salt, seasoning

in the body, being the first thing that lives, the last that dies; to a
benediction, that in all services has the first and last place* to a cup of
Nectar and Ambrosia, that warmes and prepares the stomach before meat, and to
a well-made Conserve that closes up the stomach after meat, so that where
this was wanting, bread, beer, salt and spoones, and all things were wanting.

Dido in the Poet, they had a fellow-feeling one of another misery.
Contentions there were often amongst them, but they were such as are moralized

each other in the doing of Courtesies, and performing of friendly offices one to
another, who should be most hospitable, and make more invitations? who should
entertain most neighbors, and relieve most poor? who should compose most
strifes, and be most ready to make peace between such as were at variance?
who should be most forward to undertake a commendable and worthy achievement,
and most backward to attempt a dishonest action? most ready to patronize the
good, and most slow to support the evil: most wise to find out the subtlety
of the oppressor and extortioner, and most simple to offer the least wrong to
the innocent: in a word, who should be most observant of that golden Rule of
Morality, not to offer that to another which he would not have done to
himself. Nihil vtilius est quam res regum non intelligere: vnde celebratur

Matters of state they looked not after; they knew they were standing and
reserved dishes, which Alexander had provided for his own palate, and
commanded that no man under the degree of Craterus and Ephestion, should
presume to pry into them, unless they would incur the danger which the men
of 1 Samuel 6. verse 19.
Bethshemesh did in prying into the Arc; and therefore with the wise Senators

Tiberius, they did oftentimes profess they had dined and supped when their
stomachs were empty; because they would not have Tiberius have the least
suspicion of them, that they gaped after the dishes which he had reserved for
his own palate. Prodigality they cared not for, they knew well that though it
did delight the taste, and tickle the palate, yet it engendered naught but
corrupt, waterish, and melancholic blood, which would quickly waste and fade
away; and therefore this saying went Current amongst them, as nothing can
savor of greater intemperance, than for a little pleasure which vanishes in
the throat, to adventure the health of the whole body; so nothing can savor
of greater Subitae largitionis comes paenitentia: nim^^ hauriendo fontem ipsum

madness and folly, than to waste and estate to be accounted a brave fellow
for a short season, when he shall be accounted a fool ever after. Ostentation
they looked not after, they knew it to be a meat that would set the whole body
on the Tenters, and produce nothing but noisome and ill-smelling savours; and
therefore aptly compared it to wind in the belly, which being evacuated,
becomes unsavory to every one but Suus cuique crepitus been olet.

such a one as Castilio has well set forth in his Courtier, that would be
talking of Arms unto Ladies, every one stopped his ears, as they did use to do
their nostrills against ill-smelling savours; for they did use ever, rather to
assume too little with Cato, than too much with Thraso to themselves; they
delighted not to garnish and set forth their dishes with leaves, words they
compared unto leaves, which had their Vt silvae folijs pronos mutantur in annos,

blown away with every wind; and therefore in a style that the meanest
Capacity might understand them, not in tropes and figures, riddles and
obscurities, or in phantasticke orpedanticke terms, did they express
themselves. Sloth and idleness they did eschew as two dangerous rocks and
gulfes, that would dash them in pieces, and swallow them up quick, without
leaving any manner of remembrance behind them. Hatred and intestine malice
never came in in any service, but was as loathsome as Swines flesh to the Jews;
If any offense had been given that was not of an high nature, submission was
ever held a sufficient satisfaction. You Kings that bear the sword of just

moderation by which he drew his very enemies, the Indians and Scythians unto

of whom he came to have notice by the means of young Tiberius upon a time

Petulancy and peevishnes they look not after, but left it for children and
old folks that were come unto their dotage, to feed upon: and as for See
Avarice excellently described by Chavvcer in his Book entitled the Romant of
the Rose. Avarice held in her hand,
A purse that hung by a hand;
And that she hid and bound so strong,
Men must abide wonder long.
Out of this purse ere there came ought,
For that near comes ^^ her thought;
It was not certain her intent,
That fro that purse ap^^y went.

Avarice, every one detested it, as Severus did an unjust Judge, and wrote
bitter invectiues against it; one called it stercus, another lupus, another
demon: one showed how Platoes Commonwealth flourished, because this was a
stranger there; another how the Commonwealth of Sparta perished, because this
was a familiar there: In Platoes Commonwealth (said one) no man wanted,
because no man abounded; every man had enough, because no man had more than
enough: In the Commonwealth of Sparta, many men wanted, because many men
abounded; many men had not enough, because many men had more than enough. Which
disproportion of est^tes occasioned a kind of corruption in the manners and
conditions of the people; it made the rich grow proud, high-minded, and to give
themselves to oppression, and unto a licentious course of life: it made the
poor to repine, to murmr, and to Inequality causes tumults and
insurrections.

flourishing Commonwealth upon her knees: which the Romans fearing made a
Law, which was called Lex Agraria, whereby inequality of possessions was Cried
down. Such were the feasts that these wise men made, that gave such
contentment to their guests, that every one was well satisfied; yet every one
rose with an appetite. Thus did these men spend and end their days, dying
neither too rich nor too poor, having enough to carry them through the world
to their graves, without being burdensome or troublesome to any. It was a

prayer, and well beseeming the wisest of Kings; Give me not too much, least I
grow proud and so forge thee, nor too little, least I grow too much dejected,
and so forget my self: a little to the wise, is better than great possessions
to the foolish: a Cottage well gotten, is better than a Palace gotten by wrong
and robbery. Which made old 1 Samuel 12. verse. 3.
Samuel arraigne himself and make Proclamation, that if he had taken any man's
Ox or Ass from him, or if he had wronged or oppressed any man, or if he had
taken a gift, unlawfully against any man, he was there ready to restore it.
The days of man are few and evil, and that which in the end of those few
days shall give most contentment to a man, shall be this; that no man can
justly say, that he has taken ought unjustly from him. It was a glory to
Cyrus, that he was accounted pater patriae, and he carried it to his grave with
him; but it was an ignominy to Darius, that he was accounted a Negotiator, and
he left it behind him: We brought Incedebant nudi Adam and Eva in Paradisum:

nothing into the world, neither shall we carry any thing out. Why then should
we so greedily Covet our neighbors house, our neighbors wife, our neighbors
Ox, his Ass, or any thing that is his?


Rustic: You have sufficiently showed me what Covetousnes is, and the fruits
and effects of it; I pray you now show me what Laws have been made out of this
sacred Law, to restrain the unbridled affections of Covetous persons.


Iurid: You shall understand, that from hence are derived all those Laws
called Tacit. lib. 11.
the Cyncian, the Julian, and Calphurnian Laws. By the first, Orators were
restrained for taking of rewards for pleading; by the second, suing after
dignities was prohibited; by the third, bribery and extortion in Magistrates
was condemned and punished. Again, you shall understand, that all those Laws
which are called Leges Cibariae, or sumptuariae, which do take away excessive
diet and superfluities, and all those Laws which are called leges Agrariae,
which punish the Depopulator and Encloser, are hence derived. Again, all those
Laws which punish Incests, adulteries, and fornications, and all those Laws
which punish thefts, greater or lesser, public or private, and which are
comprehended under these Titles, de Adulterijs, Abigeis, finium regendorum,
Larcenie, petit Larcenie, and the like: generally all Laws, by which any
exorbitancie or intemperancie in any kind is condemned, are hence propagated
and derived.


Rustic: I pray you Sir, satisfy me in one thing before you go any further: I
have often heard, a man may be as intemperate in his studies as in his meals.
Is this kind of intemperance within the Compass of these Laws?


Iurid: Yes certainly; vbicunque pluus vult quisque quam sat est; in what case
soever a man desires more than Plus scire velle quam sat est, intemperantiae
genus est; Senec. and Aeschylus; qui fructuosa, non qui multa scit, sapit.
enough, he incurres the danger of those Laws; and for your further
satisfaction, I would have you look into Tacitus in Agricola circ. principium.
Tacitus, and there you shall see how Agricola restrained his affections, set
a-fire after learning: and why? marry because (as he says) the most part of us
at this day are as intemperate in our studies, as in all other things; and
learn not how to live, but how to dispute. So that Lips^ lib. 1. poli^.
Lipsius confidently affirms, that the rude multitude that know no more than
what is needful for them to know, are more wise than many of our talking men,
that have a swimming knowledge in the brain, and can utter good things, but
never make use of it to reform their lives, or amend their manners. It was a
Rule amongst the Ancients, and it was a good one. Non fis fax aut tuba litis,

Let not the husbandman enterfare with the Citizen, nor the Citizen with the
husbandman: let not the Lawyer meddle with the Divine, nor the Divine with the
Lawyer. It is not for Glanco vmbra and rasa Tabula, white paper, upon whom a

It is Caesar's part to rule and govern: it is Glanco's part to serve and obey.


Rustic: O but Sir, if the husbandman shall in stead of Wheat utter chafe and
tares, will you not allow the Citizen to tell him of it? if the Citizen shall
sell and send forth base Commodities in stead of good and marchantable, will
you not allow the Countryman to do the like to him? if the Lawyer, whose house
(as Crassus says in the Orator) is as the Oracle in the City, shall set a man
out of his way, will you not allow the Divine to tell him of it? and if the
Divine shall publish false doctrine, will you not allow the Lawyer to do the
like to him?


Iurid: By no means; for in every well governed Commonwealth, there is
special care taken to have superintendents, to whom the redressing of abuses
in every faculty are committed. If a Divine offends, it belongs not to thee
being The Polypragmon or busie-body needs not to go^ any further than to the

a layman to redress it, but to the Bishop, go to him and acquaint him with
it, and if he will not do it, let the blame light upon him; thou have done thy
duty. If the Lawyer offend in his faculty, it belongs not to thee being a
Divine to redress it, go to the Judges and acquaint them with it, and if they
will not do it, let the blame light upon them. If the Citizen offend, it
belongs not unto thee being a Countryman to reform it, go to the Magistrate
and acquaint him with it, and if he will not do it, let the blame light upon
him. If the Countryman offend, it is not for thee being a Citizen to redress
it, go to the Justices and acquaint them with it, and if they will not do it,
let the blame light upon them; it is a duty belongs unto them; and thou must
not Covet that which is theirs.


Rustic: O but Sir, if a Divine shall publish in writing any thing repugnant to
the doctrine of the Church wherein he lives, I hope you will not think it
unfit for any man of the same Church to write against it and confute it.


Iurid: Nothing more unfit; unless he do it by special Command from higher
powers; for in so doing thou give occasion whosoever thou art, to the
Adversaries of the Church whereof thou art a member, to triumph and say, it is
no marvel they agree not with us, seeing they agree not amongst themselves.
Again, amongst wise men thou shall be accounted a fool for thy pains, though
perhaps among the ignorant multitude thou may win a little fame and
renown; Nam sapientes ambigunt vter stultior, is^e qui stulte dicit, an qui

use thy best means to suppress them; which is the best answer thou can
give unto them; and do not thou reprint them by answering of them; So shall
not thou incur the danger of the Laws made against intemperance or
exorbitancie in studies.


Rustic: You have given me good satisfaction; and to Conclude all, let me
desire you before we part, to tell me your opinion, in which of those four
ways you have proposed, you would have a young man that is now to take his
journey into the world to walk and pass through.


Iurid: I might answer you as Ptolemie answered the Ambassadors touching their
Laws; There being met in Ptolemies Court at a supper, where he himself was in
person, seven Ambassadors; one from Rome, another from Carthage, a third from
Sicilie, a fourth from Rhodes, a fifth from Athens, a sixth from Lacedemonie, a
seventh from A City of Peloponesus neer^ unto Corinth.
Sicion. Ptolemie moved this question unto them; Quaenam istarum provinciarum
respublicae melioribus laegibus regerentur, which of their Provinces were
governed by the best Laws? Which question after it had been wittily for a
time debated, every one standing for the Laws of his own Country. Ptolemie to
determine the Controversy, desired them vt quilibet tres leges quas in sua
quisque repub: sciret observari omnium optimas, proserret, eaque ratione
futurum putabat, vt, quaenam illarum melius regeretur, facile perspiceretur,
that every one would propose three of their best Laws, by which he made no
doubt but he should be able to judge which of the Countries had the best Laws.
Whereupon the Romane-Ambassador began thus; Romaetempla honorari, magistratibus
obedientiam praestari, malos Castigari; at Rome God is glorified, Magistrates
are obeyed, wicked men are punished. After him the Carthaginian Ambass: began
thus; Carthagine nobiles viros semper cum suis hostibus decertare, populum
laborare, Philosophos rudiores informare; at Carthage the Noble men always
wage war in person with their enemies, all men are in action, and those that
are skillful instruct those that are ignorant. After him the Sicilian Ambass:
thus; Sicilia justitia administratur, veritas amatur, aequalitas laudatur; in
Sicilie justice is duly administered, truth is beloved, and aequalitie
preferred. After him the Ambassador from Rhodes, thus; Rhodi honestos esse
viros senes, pudicos juvenes, tranquillas et illabefactas matronas; at Rhodes
old men are honest, young men are shamefast, matrones are sober and without
spot and blemish. After him the Athenian Ambass: thus; Athenis non permittuntur
divites factiosi, populus otiosus, gubernatores imperiti; in Athens it was not
permitted that rich men should be factious, poor men idle, and Governors
ignorant. After him the Lacedaemonian Ambass: thus; Lacedaemone nec invidiam,
quia omnes ibi erant aequales, nec avaritiam, quia omnia erant communia, nec
desidiam, quia omnes laborabant regnari permitti; In Lacaedemonie envy has no
place, because all men are equal, Covetousness is thrust out of doors,
because all things are in common; idleness is banished, because all men are
made to work. After him the Sicion Ambass: thus, Sycione nullos extraneos, qui
res novas excogitarent, nullos medicos, qui been valentes enecarent, nullos
advocatos, qui lites in infinitam protraherent, admitti; at Sycion no new Lords
are admitted to make new Laws: no Physicians to kill men being in perfect
health, no Advocates to spinne out and protract causes to the end of the world.
All which when Ptolemie heard, and seriously pondered them in his thoughts, he
affirmed they were all so good that he knew not, Quaenam illaru^ sit lex
praestantissima. What Ptolemie said of the Laws of those Countries, I may well
say of the ways we have past through. They are all so good, I know not which is
best: let the young man take his choice, as his fantasy leads him, he cannot
choose amiss. A more satisfactory Answer at this time I cannot give you; for
you know it is a hard thing for an Artificer to fit a man with a habit whom he
never saw, and knows not whether he be high or low, little or great; and it
would be deemed an inconsiderate part in me to take upon me to Velle suum
cuique est; huc valde pertinet responssi cuiusdam erronis, qui misere in soro
flagellis caesus, cuidam adhortanti, vteo magis sestinaret quo citius tantis
cruciatibus liberaretur, tale dedit responsum; tu cum itidem per plateas virgis

direct another what ways he should walk, when as by the Laws of Licurgus,
Nemo sequi debet id quod alterius judicio sequi jussus est, sed id tantummodo
ad quod a natura propensu^ se videt maxim. Yet I will tell you what I would
do in the like case. If I thought the young man you speak of would prove a
Choleric Capito, I would advise him to walk the private Country way
invisible as near as he could; if a patient wise man, then to take his journey
through the Cities; if a devout religious man, then through the Temple; if an
honest just man, then through the Courts of Justice. And withal, I would
advise him to bear in mind these Cautions: if he did pursue the Countryrode,
then to take heed that he did not waste too much time in the vain delights
thereof, and so the night steal upon him, and penury seize upon him, and strip
him out of his rich robes of plenty, into her own rags of ignominy. If he
had a mind to take the Cities in his way, then to take heed that he did not
trifle out the time too long in dallying and feasting with Bacchus and Venus,
and their associates, and so the night overtake him and he be compelled to take
up his lodging in Ludgate or Newgate. If he had a mind to take his voyage
through the Temple, then to beware that Simonie and Hereditarius ille morbus,
qui ab initio mundi eclesias afflixit, and pestundedit, est ambitio mixta
avaritia vt ait Iac. nuper Rex in lib. 2 ad Henric. nuper principem.
Covetousness, pride and luxury, envy and malice, did not hinder him, and so
the night overtake him, and he be compelled to take up his lodging with Simon

vidislet signa and miracula ab Apostolis facta fuisle, per impositione^ manuu^,
adductus desiderio huiusmodi gratiam assequondi, pecuniam afferebat Petro, cui
Petrus respondebat, pecunia tua tecum sit in perditione^, quia existimasti

Simon Magus, and his fraternity If he had a mind to take his voyage through
the Courts of Justice, then to take heed that he be not hindered with falsehood
and double-dealing, with lying and false informing, with bribery and
corruption, and so the night overtake him and lustice seize upon him, and make
him a scandal to all posterity. To conclude, I would advise him which way so
ever he went, to pay for what he called for, to owe nothing to any man but
love, and to carry a good tongue in his head, which if he did observe, I would
pawn my Credit, that he might walk any way until he were weary, without
disturbance and molestation. And thus the Conference ended. And thus am I come
to a period of my Discourse. Wherein I have endeavored to show that Laws are
not, as they have been fondly and ignorantly conceived, the streines and
quirks of men's wits, or the mere invention of man; but as Vniversavita
mortalium natura and legibus gubernatur; and id est lex, cuineceflarium est
omnibus parere; and cum multis alijs de causis, tu^ praeseriim, quod omnis lex
est inventum et munus Deorum (vt in quit Demosthenes) in oratione contra
Aristogitonem.
Demosthenes long ago observed (...), the invention and gift of God himself,
and given to that end and purpose, as Kings and Princes were set up in the
beginning, when the great and mighty began to oppress the poor and needy:
God set up a man whom the Graecians have well set forth in their (...) (i. e.)

(...), to whom they might flee for succor and relief. Now admit those sacred
mysteries are administered in earthen Vessels by polluted hands. Admit that
Catoes Officers do pill and polle the people, taking for their Syngrapha and
Opistographa, more then is due or belongs unto them: shall the springs of a
pure fountain loose any of their proper worth and virtue, because they run
through some unhallowed putrified Channels or Concavities, or shall Cato be
condemned? No; the Laws are springs of a pure fountain, derivatiues out of
the primitive Law of God, which cannot be polluted with unwashed hands; we
ought therefore to have a reverend opinion of them; and be more Rex et lex
differunt vna sola littera.
Si in Plut. Lycurgi et aliorum illustrium jura legendo, in quibus parum
fructus inesse solet, multum temporis consumere solemus; ne fit itaque indignum

been esse, imo esse quid, nequeant, paululum temporis consumere.


Conversant with them, because they are springs proceeding from such a
fountain.

LIPSIVS having written four Books of Civil government, and intending to
write something of military discipline, knowing how prone the multitude would
be to Censure and condemn him, that Vmbrosus one that had always lived in his
house, and mued himself up in his study amongst his Books out of the troubles
and turmoyles of the world, should presume to write of Arms and Military
Discipline, desires them to take it into their consideration, how Alexander,
great Alexander (for so he was indeed in re militari vere magnus) did esteem
of Homer a Poet, and but a Poet, that writ of wars and nothing else, and to
do him that honor that if they found him to have received what he had written
from the mouths of men of Credit and reputation, not to be too rash and
forward in their censures of him; if otherwise, then to value him and that
which he had written vt quisquiliae volantes, and venti spolia, as dust and
chafe which the wind drives to and fro. Erasmus likewise after that he had

has a tale of a scole, who by his fooling did his Master more good than all
the Physicians could do with their skill and cunning: and this it was; there
was a great rich man that lived in Vtopia, who was much troubled with the wind
Cholicke, and his daily prayer was, pro Crepitu ventris, to have the wind to
be loosed out of his belly; but finding no ease for a long time, and despayring
of health, he changed his dittie, and prayed pro regno Caelesti, that God would
give him the Kingdom of Heaven. Which his fool hearing, burst out into a
great laughter; and when the standers by reproved him for it, and demanded of
him why he was so merry, his Master being so sick, answered, to think that
his Master should be so very a fool, as to think that God would give him a
Kingdom, that denied him so small a matter as a fart. Which when his Master
heard to proceed from his fool, fell into such a laughter, that shook his
entralls, that he vented forth a little wind; in so much, that the Physician
gave out, that the venting of that wind was worth a Hunc flatum centum creed

had been a thunder dent, and demanded of the Physician what that was worth,
that so far surpassed Et tantillus (ait) si fie (te judice) tanti;

his Masters; which the Master hearing still to proceed from the fool, fell
into a second laughter, and vented so much wind, that he became a sound and
perfect man. So that Morio cured his Master, when as Quid admiraris opem
medicorum,
Si pretiosa magis podice pauper habet?

Medicus could not. I shall need no other Apology for this my Quaternio, or
more truly my Moria. If any man shall rip up those merry gigs which Sir Thomas
More made in his youth for his recreation; the scope whereof is, ne suitor vltra
Crepidam, and say; He that has left his Hosiers trade, and falls to maken
shun:
The Smith that shall to painting fall, his thrift is well me done.
When a Hatter shall go smatter in Philosophy:
Or a Pedlar wax a Medler in Theology:
A man of Law that never saw the ways to buy and sell;
Weening to rise by Merchandise, I pray God Speed him well.
If any man shall rip up those Rhymes, I say, and say, as I suppose I hear
some whispering that it is not proper to a professor of the Law to personate a
Countryman, Citizen, or Divine, or to talk of dogs and hawks, things out of
the lists and limits of his profession. To him I answer that Erasmus showed no
less Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit vtile dulci,
Lectorem delectando, pariterque monendo.
Indicat ingenium stultitia ista tuum;

Art in writing of his Book, for which he made this Apology, than he did by
setting forth the learned Labors of St. Austin, St. Hierome, St. Cyprian, and
St. Chrysostom. And Sir Thomas More gained no less credit and reputation in
writing his Vtopia, than he did in putting forth the life of Pycus de
Mirandula; and the story of King Richard the 3. Nam vt nihil nugacius est quam
Ludicra dum tracto graviter, studeo quoque, ludens;
Dum leviter tracto seria, ludo studens.
Owen:
seria nugatorie tractare: ita nihil festivius, quam ita tractare nugas, vt
nihil minus quam nugatus, fuisse videaris; as nothing is more detestable than
to handle a serious subject carelessly and negligently, so nothing is more
delectable than to handle a toy and trifle elegantly and wittily. Who cannot
go in a Common rode without a guide, and who cannot write an Encomium of the
four Cardinal virtues, when as every Book will yield unto him a helping
hand? But with that honorable Knight to write an Vtopia, or with Erasmus to
write a Panegyre of folly, or with Synesius in praise of baldnes, or with
Glauco in praise of injustice; to extract virtue out of a red Herring, or to
make a Cat speak, hic labor, hoc opus est. Who cannot discourse of the nature
of Countries, and tell how Lutetia is situated, and from thence direct the way
into Italy, and commend Naples for noblenes, Florence for fairenes, Bononia for
fatnes, Ravenna for oldnes, Venice for richnes, Millaine for greatness, and
Genoa for statelines? But with the three Optimi ad scribendu^, pessimi ad

best and worst Orators, Demosthenes, Cicero, and Isocrates, to draw the
affections of the Inhabitants of those Countries unto them, as the Adamant does
the iron, that is prayse-worthy. Who cannot glut himself, having an appetite,
that has meat enough before him? and who cannot give freely, that wallowes in
wealth and abundance? But to extract water out of a Rock, to satisfy
himself, and relieve others, that is praise worthy. Who cannot write in
Commendation of the Country life, when as Cato, Columella, Varro, Palladius,
and diverse others, have written at large de re rustica? And who cannot commend
the Laws to be most excellent, when as many before have written of that
subject? But with Seneca to read unto us golden lessons of Morality, and to
teach us how to behave our selves in the City, and in the Country; and with
Herbachius, to show whence the Laws receive this excellency, that is
prayse-worthy. If unto this I have given thee a helping hand, give God the
praise, give me thy love and good will.
