TO THE READER.
REader whosoever. If many and great judgments have descended from their high
imploiments, to please themselves at leasurable hours, with light exercises and
mirthfull recreations as Sr Thomas Moore did, when he pend his Vtopia, Erasmus
his praise of Folly, Fannius his Nettle. I trust thou will hold me excused
who at this time having no employment at all, have made this relation of the
late Progress of Meum, and Tuum, two Foot-posts, that dis-ease the whole
Kingdom, set at strife Lords and their Tenants, Clergiemen and their Parishes,
Citizens and Country Chapmen, Inkeepers and their Guests, Carmen and Coachmen
about the way, Pedlers for their standings at Faires, Gamsters in the
BowlingAlleyes, Water-bearers at the Conduite, in a word, men of all estates
and condition, one with the other. I am informed they mean shortly to visit
all the Shires in England and Wales, and in those Shires every Market Town, to
follow all Assizes, to get acquaintance among Proctors in all Spiritual
Courts, and where they cannot be themselves, to send their Deputies; So that at
their next return to the City, I shall know their full intent; which (with
what has passed since their last being in the Country) I will from their own
information hereafter (as near as I can) relate. Vale.

A MERRY DISCOVRSE OF MEUM, AND TUUM, OR, MINE, and THINE.
MEum and Tuum, borne at a Town called Wrangle in Lincolnshire, are very
anciently descended, for they can produce their Pedigree, from shortly after
the building of the Tower of Babel. Plutus was the first of their Family, who
took to Wife Eris, the Daughter of Rhadamanthus, Lord Chief justice, and
judge of Hell; she was a woman of a very contentious spirit, eager of Revenge
for the smallest wrong done unto her, she was a slaunderer of all good
Actions, a deadly enemy to Charity, but most of all she hated Unity and Amity
among neighbors and friends: if she held in with any, they were Witches and
Southsaiers, for, of all others, these were most inward with her, and of her
counsel, by whose assistance she did much mischief in the world.

Plutus had by her four Sons, and three Daughters; who sucking their Mothers
manners, with her milk, grew so quarrelsome and contentious, that one house
could not hold them, but needs they would betake, and divide themselves, into
the four parts of the world, viz. Europe, Africa, Asia, and America, where
since their Posterity is grown so numerous, that you shall come no where, but
you shall find whole Nations, City, sprivate Families, and persons at ods,
and together by the ears, upon one occasion or other.

And without question, a race of this Family have been in our Country of Great
Britain ever since it was first inhabited, ever and anon disturbing the peace
and quiet thereof, (though it has laien undiscovered) even from the Triarchie
after Brute (if you believe there was a Brute) unto the time of the Romans, so
to the Heptarchie of the Saxons, the coming in of the Danes, after of the
Normans, to our present times.

And to make this probable, not many years ago, there was an ancient man,
whose name was Harpax, dwelling in Wrangle aforesaid; whose ancestors, as he
said, were Welchmen, and could derive their pedigree from presently after
Noah's flood; and often he would report, that they were the most ancient
Gentlemen of that part of the Country where they dwelt; but so apt to quarrel
one with the other, and to set whole Countries and Kingdoms at odds, that,
what with mutual brabbles, and many times single Duels, together by siding
with contrary factions, (as the houses of York and Lancaster) they in time
were worn out, that only himself and another brother (who went to live far
North) were remaining alive.

Upon what occasion Harpax left Wales, to come to live in those parts, it is
unknown; it may be the goodness of the Soil, and the benefit of the Fenne on
the one side, and the Sea Marshes (so commodious for feeding of sheep) on the
other, were the motives of his leaving Mountainous Wales: but howsoever the
matter is not great.

This Harpax was extremely, and beyond measure covetous, and miserable, and as
great an Usurer as was in those parts, beloved of none, but equally hated of
poor and rich; for it was never known that he gave an alms at his door, or
elsewhere, in all his life. I have heard, that when he was made Churchwarden
of his Parish, he collected ten Grotes to a Breve, for a Town that was
burned in Yorkshire; and hereof he reserved sixteen pence to himself. He
never would eat Butter with his Egg, so long as it was at three pence the
pound in Wa^^flet Market; for he thought the price too high. And at the
beginning of winter, because the Draper should not be a gainer by him, he
would hang Dogs for their Skins, and suite himself with their Leather.

His wife was as bad, or rather worse; and took upon her to tell of things
that were stolen, or lost; whereby she deceived a number of poor people,
taking of them Bacon, a Cheese, a Hen, or such like, for telling them in whose
possession they were, and by whom they were conveyed away, accusing those
that were innocent, whereby, much trouble and discord arose among neighbors,
yet none durst question her for the same, for her husband was rich, and
consequently, powerful, and able to prevail with those, who should reform
these and such like abuses

This Harpax and his wife, had only two sons, who were twins, borne at one
birth; who not a whit degenerating from their predecessors; for shortly after
their birth, they would seem to wrangle for the Mothers breast, and grown
bigger, they would scratch and take hold one of another; then, after two or
three years, fall out about milk, bread and butter; and grown great boys,
at play about counters, or points, insomuch, as they never were without blew
eyes, or scratched faces; and so unhappy they were, that no other Children
would keep them company; yea, they were charged so to do by their Parents, if
they meant to live in quiet, and keep their estates, when they were men. On
the working days (for at home they had little to do) they used to go with
fisher men to the Sea, whom they made to fall out daily, about setting their
stakes, removing of nets, and division of their fish. Faires and Markets they
haunted continually, and set Gentlemen, playing at Cards or Tables, at
difference about a chance thrown, laying down a stake, or a deal'd Card
mistaken, and the like. Nay, they set their own Father and Mother at ods, in
so much not they, but the whole Country grew weary of them. Old Harpax thought,
if they stayed at home continually with him, they would eat him out of doors;
the Mother thought, they might bring her in question for a Witch, and so to a
shameful end; the Parish intended, at the next press to have packed them away
for Soldiers: but a Gentleman of good rank, and one who had been abroad,
living in the Parish, would not agree hereunto; for (quoth he) they are by
nature so contentious and quarelsome, they will raise a mutiny, and so
overthrow the whole Army.

In brief, their Father resolved to be troubled no longer with them, but to
send them into the world, to seek their fortunes, and rather forthwith while
the Summer lasted, the weather was fair, the days long, and (if extremity
constrained them) while there was means to get something in the field, as by
Hay-making, sheepe-shearing, shocking of Corn, pitching the Cart, and the
like; hereupon, as well for lightness in hot weather, as saving his money, he
clad each of them in a parchment suite, made of old Bonds and Leases out of
date; the large black lines served for lace, and the waxen seals for buttons;
for hats they had two old Monmouth Caps their father brought out of Wales,
wherein they stuck a Fen-Cats-taile or two; weapons they had none, save each of
them a broom staff in his hand, with some small sum of money in their
pockets: and thus accoustred, out of doors they go (without either asking
their Parents blessing, or once bidding them farewell) on their intended
voyage, bidding their sweet and native soil of Wrangle (for how long they
knew not) a friendly adieu.

To make a Topographicall description of this Town, (by way of digression) it
stands seven miles beyond Villam Butolphi, alias, Boston, at the hither end
of the spacious and fruitful Marsh, well known for the plenty of the biggest
and fattest sheep of England; it is adjoining to that arm of the Sea, called
by Ptolomey, Metaris Aestuarium; it was sometime a Market Town, and in the
time of Canutus the Dane, it had a fair Haven, which since the Sea has
forsaken, and is now toward the Sea filled up with sand, and upon Land become a
deep valley, wherein grass grows, and is common for their sheep. But to
return to Meum and Tuum: away they went, not gone many miles, but they fell
together by the ears, about a shoeing-horne; Tuum averring that it was given
him by his Mother, in stead of her blessing; Meum protested it was his Fathers,
and he had kept it ever since he was married, they could not agree about it;
in brief, after many bitter and unbrotherly words, they resolved one to leave
the other; so Meum went one way by Sea over to the Icenians, and Tuum by land
another: but see how it happened, after some three weeks absence one from the
other, it was Tuum's hap to come to the same Town, among the Icenians, where
Meum had placed himself with a Proctor of a Spiritual Court thereabout; this
Proctor dwelt in a Parsonage, which he farmed of an old Parson, who was a
Bachelor, and had been a Priest in Queen Mary's time; keeping only a Curat
to read prayers. The Proctor finding Meum to be pregnant and witty, taught
him the grounds as well of the Civil as common Law, caused the Curate to read
the Grammar unto him, that being grounded in the Latin, he might be fitted as
a Clerk or Notarie to write under him: the Curat, I must tell you, was no
great Scholar, or ever graduate in any University, but with long teaching
Schole in the Church, he became perfect in his ruls: preach he could not,
neither lay he in the parsonage house (which was miserably fallen to ruin, the
Barnes, Stables, and Dove-coat, being only propped up, and both unwalled and
untiled) but he had a Flock-bed upon a pallet in the Steeple of the Church,
which was both his Chamber and his Study; the Press wherein he laid those books
he had were holes in the walls, where IackDawes had formerly bred; neither did
the Bells trouble his study, or his sleep, for they rang not to prayers from
one end of the week to another, except upon the Sunday, and then not till ten
a clock. Meum being thus entertained, and having gotten an handsome black
suite, which his Master bestowed upon him; he became in no long tract of time
very skillful in his practice, and mavelous cunning in the way of suing and
citing men into the Court, for the least misdemeanour, as it shall by the
sequel appear. News was brought to the Proctor his Master, how that a
Farmer in the Parish had sold a Sow and eleven young Pigges, on purpose to
cheat him of his tyth: Meum draws a citation, to call this man to answer it
the next Court day at Icenium. Tuum in the mean time, was by strange fortune
entertained by an Attorney dwelling in the same Parish, but a mile and an half
off from the Church, who also took a great liking unto him, and made him an
under Clerk under another, that he might get experience, learn to make
Bonds, and Leases; and having likewise well clothed him, (now ashamed of his
parchment suite) he gave him Littleton's Tenures in English to read, with
Doctor and Student, and such like, to initiate, and bring him to knowledge: to
be short, Meum grew not so experienced and cunning one way, but Tuum as crafty
in another. Now this Attorney being a subtle Fox, took the Parish part
against the Proctor, in any suit that fell between the Parson and the Parish,
concerning matter of Tith. Tuum, whither he had learned so much from his
Master, or some other had instructed him, comes to him that ought the Sow and
Pigges, and tells him, he had learned that the custom was in that country,
that if the Tith Pigge were not marked for the Parson, within eight days after
the farrowing (as it was not) the owner might lawfully sell off the Pigges,
without paying Tyth at all: this suit, through the instigation of Meum on the
one side, and Tuum on the other, began earnestly to be followed and defended:
but an honest and a quiet minded Gentleman, who loved no strife among honest
neighbors, labored to make all parties friends; and it had been then
presently effected, but for Meum and Tuum, (who did vehemently ever oppose each
the other) Now in the mean time the old Parson dying, the suit ceased, and all
became friends. Now to the late old Parsons living was presented a young man, a
Mr. of Arts of Cambridge, who was as diligent in his place, as his predecessor
was remiss; for he preached every Sabbath, and Catechized in the afternoon,
reading prayers every Wednesday and Friday, observing the Canons duly in every
thing; and which crowned his other good parts, he was a great lover of Peace
and Unity among his neighbors, and could not endure any wrangling, or brabling
among his Parishioners: so that hearing what contention and strife had lately
been kindled in his Parish, through the means of Meum and Tuum, of whom he
had notice, and how that they lived in his Parish; he resolved by all means to
rid the Town of them. They on the other side, seeing now all things tending to
peace and quietness, and little left to set them on work (for as Eeles in
mud, Beetles in dung, and Swine in the mire, they delighted in nothing but base
brabbles, quarrels, and suits in law) and well knowing, they in that Country
had gained experience sufficient, pour passer par tout, and to set a a whole
Country together by the ears, they resolved forthwith to travel toward
London, and to go by Cambridge: forward they go, and the first night they
take up their Lodging in an Inn, in that ancient Town called of the Romans
Sitomagum; here they stayed four or five days, one lying at the one end of
the Town, and the other at the other: but in this little space of their stay,
they made work a twelve Month after, for all the Lawiers within ten miles
of that place: for they set the Lords of two neighboring Towns at odds; yea,
two Swinheards of the same Towns, who beat one another fearfully, about
their Swine trespassing one upon another Common: and another accident
happened, whiles they were in that Town. A certain Bailife, did use to
impound and take waifes and straies of all manner of Cattle, as fell within
that Lordship; on a time, there were taken up as straies, two Milch Kine, and
an Ox: the Bailife to cheat the owner, (if at any time he came to enquire for
Beasts) had this trick; he would provide a great Rye loaf, taken hot out of
the Oven, and put it upon the Beasts horns, whereby he would bend them which
way he listed; if they grew narrow, he would make them wider; if they
declined backward, with his hot loaf, he would bend them forward; so that
when the owner came to challenge his Cattle, he knew them not, for he would
say; surely the brand, and the eare-marke is mine; but my Cow, or Oxes horns
stood another way, this beasts horns, hang in his forehead, mine stood
upright; but surely it is as like my Cow as ever I saw: so the honest man that
owned them, durst not challenge them, but they fell as a cheat to the Lord,
rather to the Bailiefe.

This trick being discovered to Meum and Tuum, by some who had practiced the
like; Meum growing acquainted with the owner, importuned him to sue the
Bailife: Tuum persuaded the Bailife to sue the owner, for giving out threatening
words against him, and laying claim to that, which he could not justify for
his; but the Bailife being an old and a constant Guest to the Hostess, where
Meum lay, (who was a very handsome Less) She undertook they should be all
friends, and shake hands, and upon that condition, She vowed to bestow a good
piece of Beef, a dish of Eggs, and a Gallon of nappy Ale for a breakefast.

Meum and Tuum got nothing hereby, for the world was now grown wise, and
honest neighbors ended their strife and differences among themselves; so that
although they had gotten skill sufficient in these parts, yet they had gained
little for their maintenance and livelihood. Hereupon they resolved to visit
the famous University of Cambridge, and to see if they could meet with any of
Wrangle at Sturbridge Fair (for it was now after Bartholomew-tide) and going
on their way, they come to a Town called QVI, where they went into an honest
Alehouse to drink (for the weather was yet warm,) here they found the Clerk
of the Parish, a Suffolk Cheesemonger, and a Baker of Chesteron, exceedingly
joviall and merry, for they had spent eleven Grotes in sheare Ale only, beside
Cheese and Bread, which the Suffolk man and the Baker had of their own: a
reckoning being called for; the Baker, who had long served that house with
bread, denied that it came to so much, for, quoth he, Hostess, for every Pot
that came in, I unbuttoned a button; so that here are not so many, as you say
we have had Pots; but the truth is, the Baker being half foxed, had not so
many buttons at his Doublet, as Pots were broughtin; but the Hostess would
have her reckoning.

Meum and Tuum hearing this difference between the Hostess and Baker, began
to devise how they might interpose themselves, to come clear off, for what
they had called for in the house, and get somewhat more to bear charges. Meum,
while the Baker stepped out of Doors, came and whispered him in the ear, and
told him, that he was an Informer, lately come from Bury, and was going by
Cambridge toward London, and that if he would keep his counsel, he would
teach him how to be even with her, for the smalenesse of her Pots, being under
the allowance of the Statute, so that he might see them filled, and so take his
oath safely; the Baker calls in for half a dozen more, and drinks an Health
to Meum: Meum again to the Parish Clerk; he to the Cheesemonger; so the Baker
well pleased, fetches from his basket two Manchets, and gets Cheese of the
Suffolke-man, and bids Meum fall to and welcome. The Hostess, not suspecting
any judgling or Treason against her at all, sits quietly, talking in the
Kitchen with Tuum; who having overheard those ill words the Baker gave her, and
his misreckoning; calls her on the one side, and tells her in private, that he
was a Promotour, belonging to the Exchequer, and by his oath and office, he
could not choose but inform against the smalnesse of his Bread, wanting in
every penny Loaf two Ounces (for they borrowed Scales and sealed Weights, to
weigh it, at a Chandlers in the Town) the Hostess finding her self to have
been cheated, for many years together; willingly consented to be revenged
upon the Baker: Tuum takes the day and year in his Table Books, faithfully
promising the Hostess, forthwith to inform; and that for his part, he would
freely bestow his part of the Fine upon her, as pitying her loss, for so long
a time: The Hostess, with a low courtsie, thanks him heartily: hereupon Tuum
called to pay; truly not a penny, if it were twice as much, quoth the Hostess;
with that she fetched forth a quarter of a roasted Pigge, and a dish of new
gathered Damsins, with a Mazer of good Ale, wherein she powered a little cup of
Anise-seede water, and drank to Tuum, desiring him to know her house another
time; he promised he would. So calling his Brother Meum from the Bakers
company, to set forward toward Cambridge, the Clerk of QVI desired Tuum to stay
but a little, and knocking upon the Table with the Church-dore Key, called for
a Cap of Cambridge beer, and drank to Tuum, craving his name; he told him; I
am his Brother, quoth Meum; in good time, quoth the Clerk, came you not out of
the Land of Pronounes? and have you no relation to our Town of QVI? no, quoth
Meum, your Town should rather have relation to us, for every Grammar Boy
knows, that QVI is a Pronoune Relative, and we are Possessives; in good time,
quoth the Saffolke man, we have too few of you in our Country, (when indeed
they had too many) but the day being far spent, Meum desired to be going;
but the Baker following him out of doors, spoke something in secret unto him,
and very likely gave him something to follow his suit; howsoever they all
parted in a friendly manner, they going their several ways, and Meum and Tuum
for Cambridge.

Being come to Cambridge in very handsome and civil apparel (for they had
long since, sold their parchment suits to a Tailor for Measures) like wise
Travailers, the first thing they did, they enquired for, and took up their
Lodging, which was (an Emblem of themselves) at he Two Wrestlers in the
Petit-curie, where having taken up two several Beds, they were quiet and
merry, for that night; the next day they went abroad to view the Town, and
especially the ruins of the Castle, built by William the Conqueror,
Pythagora's School, and the Round Church, sometimes a Synagogue of the Jews,
the Nunnery of Saint Radigunde, now converted into Jesus College, and not
far beyond, that sometimes fair and well seated Abbey of Barnwell, built by
Sir Pain Peverell, Standard Bearer to the Conqueror, returning back, they
visited the Colleges; and one showed them Erasmus his Chamber and Study, in
Queens College, where he lay while he was in Cambridge, as appears by many
of his Epistles: but above all other, they desired to see the common Schools,
and desired to hear the Disputations, and wranglings of Sophisters; with some
of whom after they had acquainted themselves, they learned all the rules of
Arguing, with the Nature of Syllogismes, and every Fallacy, whereby they
enabled themselves, for reasoning pro and con in all places, and upon every
occasion; and were now became able to entangle any Adversary, or Opposite in
Logical limetwigs. Now having well viewed the University and Town, and being
furnished with Latin and Logic, enough for the practice of the Law, they take
their leaves, and to London forward by Trompington they go: being gone some
ten miles from Cambridge on their way; they espied many people at a Towns end,
gathered in a cluster together, about a Pearetree, that grew in the midst of
an hedge, and amongst them the Clerk of the Parish. Meum wondering to see them
there, could not devise what the occasion might be; quoth Tuum, surely there is
a Swarm of Bees in the Tree: that time of the year is past, quoth Meum, it
may be there is some Foxe-earth, Hedghog, or the like; nay, then why should the
Clerk be there? he has no skill in Foxe-hunting; it may be, sometime he
will follow the Hounds for his recreation: but the truth was, indeed that
Peare-tree was in controyersie between the owners of the Closes, on either
side of the Hedge, and they in contention, who should have the Pears; the
Vicar knowing not of whom to demand the Tyth of that Tree, attended there, till
the controversy was ended; those people were ancient men and neighbors, who
came to ma^^ peace, and to testifi^ (...) whom ^s they thought the right lay:
Meum and Tuum argued the case, as Lawyers, and concluded after a long dispute,
that some lusty fellow in the company should go up, and shake the Tree, and
what Pears fell on either side the Hedge, should be theirs who owed the
grounds, and those that fell in the Hedge, should appertain to neither of
them, but all should go to the Vicar, for his Tyth: they were all contented,
and so carrying Meum and Tuum to their Alehouse, which was hard by the
Church-stile, at an old Widdow-womans, they gave them great thanks, with the
courtesy of their Town, and to boot, their pockets full of Pears.

Forward they go, and at last get to London, a place they long longed to see,
especially Westminster, and the Courts there in Term time: wherefore they
resolved to lodge and place themselves thereabout. Meum took a Chamber in
Theeving-lane: Tuum, a little dark room, that had but one window, no bigger
then a Cat might creep through, hard by Hell, near to the upper end of
Westminster Hall: being provided of their lodging, the next day they had an
humor (having yet nothing to do,) to go see a Beare-baiting, over the Water;
but coming to Westminster Bridge, they found the Watermen pitifully fallen
out, and railing one at another, and almost together by the ears, about their
Fares; one crying out, Sir Thomas, or Sir Henry, I am your first man, here is
your worship's Boat, I carried you to Brainford last Thursday: they seeing the
Gentlemen so vexed, with haling and calling on every side, with such a thunder
of several tones, that were able to make a man more deaf then the Cataracts
of Nilus; Tuum craves silence of them, and thus speaks to the Gentlemen in
private; Gentlemen, quoth he, it is now Vacation, and the deadest time thereof,
and I suppose you are going over the water, as we are, I will tell you, for a
quart of Wine, and a pecke of Oisters on the other side, I will lay a Spell
under this Bridge, where the Tide shall not wash it away, that as long as it is
there, from hence forward, the Watermen every Vacation shall be silent and of
very few words, and during the Term they shall have the gift of curing all
that are thick of hearing; the Gentlemen, being ingenuous and free,
condescended; and I have heard, the same Charm or Spell lies under
Westminster Bridge yet.

But now come over to the Beare-garden, and seeing the manifold contention and
quarrels between the Beare-wards and the City Butchers, for the first turns,
or courses with their Dogs, all having promiscuously paid their money, and
were ready with their bats to knock one another down; Meum began to give hard
language to the Beareward, taking the Butchers part: a Bearward (as they are
feirce and chollerick) like their pupils, the Bears) strikes at Meum with a
good Crab-tree cudgel; he to avoid the blow, fell backward, quite over a
Bears back; herewith the Bear fell a roaring: Tuum (whose back was turned)
looking behind him, and seeing Meum, as he thought, felled to the ground and
slain, and verily believing it was he that rored, when he fell, ran, as if he
had been frantic, out of doors; and as he came hastily by where a Bull was
baited hard by, (such was his hard fortune, that) to avoid the press of the
people, he came within the Bulls reach, the Bull being become furious and mad,
with many blows, Dogs, slitting his ears, and the like, runs full at Tuum,
and with his horn taking hold of his Breeches, tossed him up; but Tuum having
but one point, that brake, and his Hose fell about his heels; which made all
the standers by forget the Bull, to laugh at, or pity him: away then goes Tuum
to the water side, and taking a Boat, leaves Meum to follow at his leisure.

The same night both meeting with either at Westminster, they related their
hard fortune, professing never to come any more among Dogs and Bears: but
the Term being at hand, to keep company with Lawyers, and their Clients only.

The Term being come, they now thought it best to acquaint themselves with
some understanding Attorneys, and Clerks of the Innes of Chancery, who might
as well set them in a way to practice, as to get them acquaintance: and first
they enquired for Lions Inn (a Country Careier directed them to the Tower,
where the Lions were) which when they had found, they grew acquainted with many
Students, who were Cornish and Devonshire Gentlemen: who (when Meum and Tuum
had related unto them their names, whence they came, and those various
accidents that had befell them, in their journey, ever since they came from
Wrangle) made very much of them, imagining they had been great Students, and
very expert in the Laws: but being examined and thoroughly tried by a very
honest Attorney of that house (who wanted his sight) he found them to be
nothing else, then incendiaries and make-bates in the Common wealth, and wished
them to live in the country, and rather go make peace among their neighbors,
then set them at variance; for we (quoth he) who are Attorneys, if men would be
quiet and agree among themselves, would never entreat or sue for employment
from them; but when as suits, by delay or neglect (as wounds) begin to fester
and gangrene, then indeed we ought (as Surgeons) to do our best to make an
easy and speedy cure; with many other good Adviso's, which they little
regarded: but taking their leaves, went to some houses (I will not name) where
they found good respect and entertainment. And finding some encouragement, to
Westminster they go, where looking about them, they admired the largenes and
stateliness of the Hall, and above, that the timber of the roof, having been
there so long, should be without Cobwebs; perhaps, quoth Tuum, they are swept
down against the Term; quoth Meum, thou art a fool, all Kentstreete cannot
afford a beesome so long; a country man over hearing them, answered, the roof
was made of Irish timber, which no Spider durst touch; if there were any
Cobwebs, they were beneath, about the Clarks and Notaries Seats, which are
seldom or never swept. When they had sufficiently gazed about, and observed as
much as they could, coming out with the Country man, they viewed well the
great door of the Hall; where they espied two Stags Couchand, with Crowns
about their necks, and chains thwart their backs; they asked the reason of
their being there: the Country man said, doubtless it was because so much
Venison had been eaten in that Hall, when the Kings of England held their
great feasts there: Tuum thought rather they were some tame Dear, because of
their chains: but the truth is, the Hall of Westminster was built anew by K.
Richard the second, and they were his Badges, for the Kings Mother, whom the
black Prince married, was widow to Lord Holland, Earl of Kent; and being one
of the most beautifullest Ladies of England, and called the fair Maid of Kent,
before her marriage, She gave for her Devise (or Crest) the white Hind; which
her Son the King, altered into a Stagge. But to return to our new Termers,
Meum and Tuum; within a day or two, they ordered the matter so, that they gat
acquaintance in all the Courts of Westminster; and in no long time, by
observation and practice, they grew so expert, that they were still at one end
of every Cause that was pleaded: not a Counselor, nor Attorney belonging
either to the Kings Bench, Commonpleas, or any other Court, but grew acquainted
with them, and many times, in friendly manner, would salute them with, Good
morrow Mr. Meum, Save you Mr. Tuum, I pray let me see you at my Chamber, I have
been, (and so have we all) much beholding unto you, for your acquaintance and
furtherance, we many times fare the better for you: yet Meum and Tuum they
were like the Whetstone, that could sharpen every thing, yet it self was
blunt, they could enrich others, yet were ever in want (for indeed men ever by
suits and contention beggar themselves, as we see by daily experience,) howbeit
they gat sufficient to maintain them hand somly, and now and then to go to the
Dog Tavern at Westminster, (who I remember, the last day of the Term, bit
Meum fearfully) to bid a friend to Supper, and the like: and whereas before
they were called by their bare names only, they were called now Mr. Meum, and
Mr. Tuum. Now having been thoroughly acquainted with Westminster, but
Westminster better with them, and some three or four Terms past, and the long
Vacation coming on; they heard there was a controversy between certain
Gentlemen, Projectors, and of the Country where they were borne, about the vast
and spacious Fennes thereabout; whereupon imagining there might be good
fishing in those troubled waters, they resolved to go down thither, to make a
division among them, if they could not agree among themselves. So putting money
convenient in their purse, away for their Country they go, playing many merry
tricks by the way, which would fill three such books as this, if I should
recount them in order. Now by the way, if they should happen to want money,
Meum resolved to take upon him the name and profession of a Physician, and to
cure all manner of diseases and griefs by stroking the part pained, and
uttering some few words, by way of charm (as you shall hear anon,) Tuum
would, like a Gypsey, be a teller of Fortunes, especially to widows and young
wenches; and indeed they got hereby much money, and grew famous. One thing I
must not forget, by the way, as they went three or fourscore miles from
London, as they walked down a Lane, a great shower of rain fell, which
constrained them to go through a Gentleman's yard, who had been a Justice of
the Peace, and was sitting in a wicker chair, (and the Constable of that
Parish, a little distance off, upon an Hogstrough) to see his Swine ringed: the
Justice was clad in cloth, spunne in his own house, seldom came he up to
London, but ever staid at home, keeping a good house among his neighbors: Meum
and Tuum passing by, saluted him with all due respect; my friends, quoth he,
you are welcome, where is your dwelling? quoth Meum, An't please your worship,
in Westminster, in a place called Theeving Lane, and my Brother about, or near
to Hell; by my honesty, quoth he; both bad and naughty places, I wonder my
fellow Justices thereabouts will take no order with that Lane, either to place
honest men in it, or to remoove it further off, from his Majesty's Court: I
have heard that in Queen Elizabeth's time, much Pla^e, Hangings, and other
things, stolen from White Hall, have been found thereabouts; it may be so,
quoth Tuum, Thieves may be found in all places, but I assure your worship,
many as honest and substantial people dwell in that Lane, as in any other
place about Westminster; how it came by that name, I know not, it may be out of
envy some gave it that name: indeed quoth the Gentleman, it may be so, but it
is impossible: How, I pray you, may I call your names? our names, quoth Meum,
are Meum and Tuum, they are, as I take it, out landish names; no indeed, quoth
Tuum, they are Latin; it is true, quoth the Gentleman, Tuum is mine, and Meum
is thine, I have not forgot my Latin; and whither are you travailing this way?
indeed, quoth Meum, we travel all places, but now we go directly for our
own Country (except some occasion extraordinary detain us by the way) that
is, down into the Fennes, and from thence back to London; we are dablers in
the Laws, and well known to all the Courts about Westminster; I pray God not
for Pickpockets; we cut, nor pick no purses, quoth Tuum, but empty them after
a legal way, for there is not a trial but we have an hand in the same, and in
every suit, though never so long depending; I wonder quoth the old quondam
Justice, how you escape from being indicted for common Barreters? quoth Meum,
all Judges are beholding to us for their Reports, we are the Steel and Flint,
who hew out the fire, and afford light to their judgments and understandings,
and, as it were, ^liciendo veritatem, mutuo collisu, per experientiam and longo
rerum usu, for every Term we devise and bring to light new and strange cases;
those beget others, and so in infinitum: it is very probable, quoth the
Justice, for I have seen Strife, I think you call it Lis in Latin, painted,
going upon skrewes in stead of Legs; and, as I take it, it stands in my
worthy friends Hall, Sir Daniel de Ligne, at his house at Harlaxton by
Grantham; but, I am glad I have met with you, to ask your opinion in one
thing. About twenty years ago, when I sat at our Sessions, and was Eldest
Justice, a Tinker was brought us for stealing of a Porredge Pot, and his
inditementranne, for felloniously taking and carrying away, upon such a Day, in
such a Month, one brazen Porredge Pot, weighing forty nine pounds, with three
ears, and two feet; now, as we all know, a Porredge Pot has only two
ears, and three feet: I was the first that found this same error in the
indictment, whereupon the Jury brought in Ignoramus; whether was it not well
done of me or no? An't like your worship, quoth Tuum, they could do no other.
Again, there was within some three or four miles of me, an ancient farm
house, the title where of was in controversy, and the Owner herein had placed
four or five lusty fellows, his friends and servants, to keep the
possession; now in the Rogation week last past, the Minister and the whole
Parish were to go their Procession; their way (which was the division of two
Parishes) was through the Hall and the Kitchen, and through the midst of the
Orchard, by the end of a Swine-coate; they who kept possession, denied entrance
to the Procession, and barred up the Gates against the Minister and the whole
Parish: they seeing this, sent for a Smith, and brake up the doors, and
moreover pulled down a wall, that stopped their way. I now demand, Mr. Meum,
whether the Owner (who indeed was my near Kinseman) might sue the Parson and
his Parish for a Riot or not? quoth Tuum by no means, a Procession must have a
way made to their hands, or make it themselves; beside, the public custom of
a Parish, must be preferred, before a private Title in question, provided no
Park be prejudiced thereby; yet if my Brother and I, quoth Tuum, had been
entertained in that, or the like case, we would have held the Parish to it for
one seven years: God forbid, quoth the good Gentleman, there were no
Conscience or Charity in that; yet when both of you are soundly out, and at
odds, one with another, you little think of Conscience or Charity, nay, upon
my knowledge your selves, or get others to do so much for you. With that he
called to have the old Sow well ringed, for rooting up her Mistrisses Parsneps;
and sends Cicelie his Maid, for a Flaggon of good beer, of that Hogges-head
which stood under the Stairs; which being done, he heartily drank unto them,
desiring that if they at any time passed by his house, they would visit him,
and if he had any occasion to use them (which he thought he should never have,
grown in years, and loving peace, and his rest, he would employ them: they
thanking him kindly, take their leaves and departed.

Being on their way, they heard of a great Fair, which was at a Market Town
about eight miles of; thither they resolved to go, to try what acquaintance
they could meet withal, or what purchase they could come by: coming to the
Town, they heard of one Master Lime, a rich Attorney, who was much troubled
with the gout. Meum imagined there might some good be done with him, in regard
as well that he was a Lawyer, as diseased, because it was vacation, and he
intended to practice Physic; Tuum staying at an Alehouse in the Fair, Meum
enquires after Master Limes, (who by this name should seem to be a Dorset
shire man) this Master was, it is true, of late years an Attorney, but grown
rich, old, and unfit for Travel, had given over his Practice, and now only
betook himself to a private life, (being exceeding rich in money and lands)
and only now endeavor to make peace among his neighbors, if any suits or
dissension arose among them, which indeed he truly performed; for if any two
rich landed men were at strife, about some piece of ground, cottage, and the
like, one of these, sometime both, would come to him for his counsel; him, in
whom he knew the right to remain, he would tell; it would prove a chargeable
and a tedious suit, and likely to be brought into the Chancerie; the quantity
was not great, it held in Knights service, and might bring the rest of his land
into bondage; he would advise him to take money, and sell his right: then
sending for his adversary, he tells him his title was not worth a rush, the Law
was plain against him, and wished him (as he did the other) to take a piece
of money for agreement, and so order the matter (if it were land that lay for
his turn,) as next his own, or near his house) he would hook it in to
himself, at no great rate: then with a quart or two of wine, at the next
Tavern, make them both friends, and very kindly to shake hands together.

Again, if some young Heir, newly come to his lands, had formerly run into
the lash four or five hundred pounds thick, and his Creditors taking the
opportunity of his fortunes, would bear with him no longer, but lay out to
arrest, and every way to vex him; old Lime underhand would furnish the young
Gentleman with money, to satisfy them all; but before take a Morgage of all
his land, happily might be worth an hundred, or sixscore pounds, per Annum;
which he being unable to redeem, at the appointed day, taking up a second
sum, sells it all unto him out right, then calls his Creditors together, and
makes him and them friends, and undertaking the debt himself, he there
tenders them down the one half of their money, the rest he paies by parcel
and petty sums at his leisure.

Sometimes he is trusted with money gathered in the Country for charitable
uses, as Building, or repairing of Bridges (in regard of the great credit he
has in the Country, and his acquaintance with the better sort) reparation of
Sea-banks, High ways, and the like, but he keeps it close, till extremity,
and the fear of a Pursevant wrings it out of his fist.

But Meum and Tuum, not knowing any way in the world to come by money, in case
Master Lime should be from home, and the humor take him to lend them none,
considering he had been so much beholding unto them, or their kindred: Meum,
as I said, began to practice in the Town, taking upon him to cure all Aches,
Tumors, Wounds, Dislocations, Distemperatures, and in general all manner of
Diseases by stroking with the hand, and uttering certain words by way of a
charm: Tuum took upon him to be his man, and was to make good whatsoever he
spoke of himself, and his depth of skill in that manner of cure. Beside, Meum
had in a readiness a Catalogue, and a counterfeit Testimonial of Lords,
Ladies, Gentlewomen, and Merchants Wives, Mayds, and of all sorts, whom he had
cured after that way, some of Dropsies, the Chollicke, Agues, and the like:
Tuum was to affirm, he was the seventh son of a seventh son: but this one
thing troubled Meum much, that was, if any patient should demand of him the
name and quality of his disease, and what were the Symptoms of the same, he
could not tell; wherefore he held it the best course of professing, to cure all
at once; neither durst he go any Empyricall way to work, in giving this or
that to his Patient, for he had no more skill in a Drug then my Dog, knowing no
more what to give, then they knew what to take, and stroking was a thing of
neither labor, or cost, which a little Loveret; or the veriest Ass in England
might do: yet to let the world know he was not ignorant in the knowledge of
Simples, by the way, he would dig up some roots with his knife, no matter
what, which cut in pieces and clean scraped, he would put into his
handkercher: these dried by the fire, and beaten to powder, he would give alike
to all, yea those that were most dangerously sick, either in Posset-ale, or
the pap of an Aple, and if any such recovered by the strength and benefit of
Nature (as some do) then (as he would often say) his fame would fly far, and
his name be made known to all the Country. The roots he carried commonly
about him were called Morsus Diaboli the devils bit which grows in Corn
fields, and Meadows, the Fenne Parsnep, which is sweet and has the taste of
our common Parsnep, but present poison, (as one Hamon Rainard in the Fenne
prooved, for bringing home many, caused them to be boiled and buttered, but in
the space of the burning of a Candle, his Wife, Children, and himself died)
sometime he would venture upon Sol^^am or nightshade, one Dram whereof is able
to kill a Cariers Horse. Such a Doctor I remember, I my self met withal at
Vtrecht in the Low Countries, who commonly was called Docter John, an English,
or a Welsh man, I known well whether, this Doctor (for so the people called
every Mountebanke) was much sought unto, and was had in great admiration for
his judgment, in so much he could not eat or drink in quiet, for patients
flocking unto him; Scholar he was none, for he could hardly read, or write his
own name: I having been one day at dinner with that noble Gentleman, the
Grave or Earl of Culenberge, by chance I there in a Garden met with Doctor
John, (having been formerlie acquainted with him) and demanded of him, whence
he had those rare drugs, whereby he wrought such wonders in his profession?
John having well tasted of the Earls wine, as in vino veritas, confesses
freely unto me, he had nothing from either Indies, City Druggist, or
Apothecarie, saving some herbs and roots, which he gathered in the Spring,
under a great quick-set hedge on my left hand, in the way to Vtrecht (which was
three miles off,) and these were commonly the roots of young Bri^rs, Brionie,
Daisies, Dandelion, Crow-feete, and the like, which dried upon a Tilestone or
Slate, he also (as Meum did) beat to powder; and gave his Patients to drink
in posset drink, white wine, and the like; but if they were taken with
pestilent, or continual burning Fevers, then he gave them the said powder in
Canarysack, Anise-seed, Wormwood: water, or the like.

Meum being furnished, as you have heard, now verily believed that he was a
good Physician indeed; and now having a mind (as the Proverb is) to see the
Town served; and to provide for a good lodging, as well during the time of the
Fair, as after; at the corner of a Lane, they met with an old Woman, carrying a
Pitcher of Buttermilke in one hand, the other held up her apron, wherein was a
Cat blind folded; of her they enquired of an honest Alehouse, or private house,
where they might hire a couple of Chambers; she told them, in a lane on their
right hand, was a very good and a quiet house, at the sign of the two Bears,
and the Bee-hive; herein they entered, and found entertainment, and having
caused their apportements to be laid up, away they go to Master Lime's house;
knocking at the door, out comes a spruce and a dapper youth, surrounded at the
knees with points, russet Boots and Spurs, with a pen in his ear; he
asking our errand, we told him, we came to speak with Master Lime, and we
suppose you are his Clarke; I am indeed, and my name is Twig, quoth he, will
you be pleased to enter, my Master is not very busy; in they came, and found
Master Lime in an upper Chamber, sitting by a good fierin a Wickar Chair, with
three or four night Caps, and an old greasy Hat on his head, one foot upon
the Tongues, in the Chimneycorner, and the other on a little buffet stool upon
a Cushion, his leg many times bound about with a rouler of red cloth; my
friends, quoth he, you are welcome, have you any Law business? Sir, quoth
Meum, you have heard of us heretofore, though you never saw us till now; our
names are Meum and Tuum: Body a me, quoth Master Lime, I never saw you indeed,
I have been much beholding to some of your name: those are near of kin to
us, quoth Meum, it may be we are those you mean: quoth Lime, Twig set some
stools, and give me your hands; Meum and Tuum have helped me to many a fee;
but now I have given over my practice, I have sold my Chamber at London, now I
keep home, and love to make peace amongst my honest poor neighbors, for I
tell you, we live in a jangling corner. Master Meum, do your brother and you
follow the Law still? I mean your soliciting causes? No Sir, quoth Meum, it is
now not Term time, but a dead Vacation, and I addict my self, to avoid
idleness, to the practice of Physic; Heaven, Sir, has given me a great
gift to cure any manner of disease, only by stroking, whether in Man, Woman, or
beast; it is very rare and a wonderful gift indeed, Twig fetch me a Cup of
Beer, and Master Meum, if I may see you in the morning, I will try your skill
upon this lame leg of mine, I lie long a bed, you may come when it pleases
you, but fail not, so good night to you both, quoth Lime. They taking their
leaves, went home, and having supped, betook themselves to their lodgings: now,
there being two Beds in one Chamber, where they were to lie (for they never lay
together) they fell out for the best Bed, but drowsinesse and desire of rest,
being tired with long journeyes, decided their difference.

Up they rise the next morning; Meum goes to Master Limes, and being by Twigge
brought up to his Chamber, there lay upon a mat, under Lime's bed, a foul
crop-eard Curre (which a Scrivener had given him not long before) whom they
called interest, a fierce, a cruel Mastive, for where he laid hold, you could
hardly get him off, and commonly he would make his teeth mere; he spying Meum
in somewhat a strange habit, and a part of his shirt hanging out at his knee,
flies suddenly upon him, tears his breeches down from the wast to his hammes;
Meum cries out; Twigge, who was gone down the stairs, comes running up,
crying to Interest, come out, out here you Curre, the Devil take him, quoth
Meum, he comes out too fast, I pray Master Twigge call him in: I have told you
often enough, quoth Master Lime to Twigge, of letting this Dog be untied;
come Interest, you must be friends with Meum, and Tuum by the rules of Lilly,
a Tailor shall be sent for to mend your hose; I but, quoth Meum by the law of
Littleton it is otherwise, but there is no remedy against a mischance. I pray
you (quoth Lime) to look upon my Leg, and tell me how you like it; I will
assure you Sir, quoth Meum, though it be now gouty and much swelled, it
appears to be a very straight and an handsome Leg, and I believe you have
been an excellent dancer in your younger days; indeed a pretty one, for I
danced out of the North to this Town, but with fourteen pence in my Purse,
and I have a pretty convenient estate, of some five hundred by the year, and
not a Child living; but I pray, Sir, look upon my Leg; Meam tuckes up his
sleeves, warmes his hands, stroking his Leg and Foot above and beneath,
gently touching every Toe; then casting up his eyes, after a ceremonious
manner, pronounces these words in the Bohemish tongue, Uobiesh lesa^ atac
zhogi le non hatua. Which in Latin is; suspende corpus, and pes sanabitur:
[that is, hang up the body, and the Leg will mend:] which done and his Leg
bound up again; I promise you, quoth Master Lime, I find pretty good Pase
already: Twigge, give Master Meum half a e eece for his pains, toward the
mending of his Breeches; and Master Meum I heartily thank you, if any of my
neighbors stand in need of your help, I will bring you acquainted with them;
how long stay you in Town? We are uncertain, Tuum has some employment I
believe and cannot yetgoe, although our employment is, ike to be great, when
we come among the Fennes, for indeed that way we are going, but shortly to
return toward London: then I pray let me see you as you return back: Meum
promised he would, and so took his leave: but going down the stairs, Twig
followed him at heels, and whispers him closely in the ear, that he had a
friend hard by, which was an handsome one (indeed a Tanners daughter, who was
his sweetheart) who was troubled with a great swelling, and if he could do
her any good, he should have content to his desire: but that cure passed
Meum's skill.

Tuum was not idle all this while at his Hostesses, for by her means he had
gotten many Clients, who came to him for goods lost and stolen, as Hogs
straied away, Turkies stolen; a Maid came to Tuum for a silver Spoone, stolen
out of the Noursery; another made pitiful moan to Tuum for the loss of his
wife, who was run away with a Miller, besides something he got, for telling
Maids and Widows their fortunes.

Meum to endeare himself the more (for rarity is the mother of admiration)
kept himself close in his Chamber; and if any had occasion to use him, they
mustrepaire unto him at night, or early in the morning; at what time there
resorted unto him people of all sorts, Ladies, Gentlewomen, and other honest
Women, for sore Breasts, swellings in the Throat, Cankers in the mouth, the
Toothach, and all griefs else whatsoever. Meum seeing his Patients come so
thick, grew into an humorous pride, that he would stroke but whom he listed,
and when he listed; but howsoever in few days they had gotten nine or ten
pounds; so that they thought it was now high time to be going, remembering well
that, Ficta persona non diu geritur; overnight making even with their Hostess,
away they went the next morning.

But this one thing fell out most strangely, that as many as Meum had stroked,
both men, women, and children, very presently after fell cruelly out one with
another: Master Lime sued the Parson of the Town; Women of the better sort,
the next Holy Day fell out flat in the Church, for place and precedence, who,
forsooth, should sit uppermost in the same seat: which quarrel the Minister of
the place would moderate and settle with good words, in this, or the like
manner.

I think honest neighbors and friends, there ought in the Church, (saving for
decency in the placing of Magistrates, and chief Governors) to be no
difference: and this ambition for place and superiority in the Church, cannot
be but foolish, if not impious; when time, in not many years, will make no
difference in lodging you, even in those Alleyes you sit in, and tread upon;
therefore I have heard it is a custom in the Netherlandr, for Burgers wives
and their daughters every one to carry their Leather little chaires to Church
with them, there taking their places as they fall: Another, wife to a
Rope-maker at a Churching would eat no meat, because a Ioyners wife sat
above her: but do what they listed, Meum and Tuum had got themselves away, and
were far enough.

Being come at last down into their native Country among the Fennes, which
seemed to be in Controversy, between the Projectors and the Country, they
found all things appeased and quiet, all parties were agreed, and nothing
remained for Meum and Tuum to work upon; whereupon they resolved to go
farther Northward: but even at this time, they hearing of old Harpax their
Father's death, back they returned to Wrangle, where I hear they are now in
suit, at strife, for his land and goods; Meum affirming himself to be the
elder Brother, Tuum says he is as old as he, for they be twins: which is
like to prevail we shall know at this next Term, when they return up to
London. In the mean time I leave them wrangling, at their Native Town of
Wrangle, where I first found them.

FINIS.
