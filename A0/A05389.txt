THE MOST NOBLE ancient, and learned play, called the Philosophers game,
invented for the honest recreation of students, and other sober persons, in
passing the tediousnes of time, to the release of their labors, and the
exercise of their wits.

Set forth with such plain precepts, rules, and tables, that all men with ease
may understand it, and most men with pleasure practice it. by Rafe Lever and

Vulnere virescit virtus. The Lord Robert Duddelye.


The Physnogmie here figured, appears by Paynters Art:
But valyant are the virtues that, possess the inward part.
Which in no wise may painted be, yet plainly do appear.
and shine abrod in every place with beams most bright and clear
TO THE RIGHT HOnorable, the Lord Robert Dudley, Master of the Queens
Majesty's horse, Knight of the most honorable order of the Garter, and one of
the Queens majesty's privy Counsel, JAMES ROVBOTHVM heartelye wishes
longelife, with increase of godly honor and eternal felicity.
Since that your honor is full bent,
(right honorable lord)
To vvisdo^ and to godliness
with true faithful accord
Since that in deed you do delight,
in learning and in skyll:
The shovv vvherof does well express
a perfect godly will.
Since that also you have in hand,
affairs of force and weight:
And study do both day and night,
to set all things full straight.
I thought therefore your honor should
not lack some godly game:
Whereby you might at vacant times
your self to pastyme frame.
Whereby I say you might release,
such travails from your mind:
And in the mean while honest mirth
and prudent pastyme find.
Remembering then this ancient play,
where vvisdome does abound:
Called the Philosophers game,
me thinkth I have one found.
Which may your honor recreate,
to read and exercise:
And which to you I here submit,
in rude and homly wise.
Pithagoras did first invent,
this play as it is thought:
And thereby after studies great,
his recreation sought.
Yea thereby he would well refreshe,
his studious vvery brain:
And still in knowledge further vvade
and plye it to his gain.
Accompting that a wicked play,
vvherin a man leudely:
Mispendes his time and wit also,
and no good getts thereby.
But grievously offendes the Lord,
and so in steed of rest:
With trouble and vexation great,
on every side is pressed.
Most games and plays abused are,
and fevve do now remain:
In good and godly order as,
they ought to be certain.
For why? all games should recreat,
the heavy mind of man:
And eke the body ouerlayde:
with cares and troubles than.
But now in stead of pleasant mirth,
great passions do arise:
In stead of recreation now,
reuengings we practice.
In stead of love and amity,
long discords do appear:
In stead of truth and quietness,
great oaths and lies we hear.
In stead of friendship, falshode now,
mixed with cruel hate:
We find to be in plays and games,
which daily cause debate.
Pithagoras therefore I say,
to make redress herein:
Invented first this godly game,
thereby to fly from sin.
Since which time it continued has,
in French and Latin eke:
Still exercisde with learned men,
their comforts so to seek.
VVherby without a further proof,
all men may be right sure:
That this game unto gravity,
and vvisdome does allure.
Else would not that Philosopher,
Pithagoras so wise:
Have labored with diligence,
this pastime to deuyse.
Else would not so well learned men,
have amplified the same:
From time to time with travel great,
to bring it into fame.
But let us nerer now proceed,
and come we to theffect:
And then shall we assuredly,
this pastime not neglect.
For it with pleasure does assuage,
the heavy troubled heart:
And with like comforts drives away,
all kind of sourging smart.
The mind it makes circumspect,
and heedfull for to be:
The time that thereon is bestovvd,
is not in vain truly.
The body it does stir and move,
to lightsomnes and joy:
The senses and the powers all,
it no wise does annoye.
It practices Arithmeticke,
and use of number shovvth:
As he that is conning therein,
assuredly well knovvth.
In Geometry it truly vvades,
and therein has to do:
A learned play it is doutlesse,
none can say nay thereto.
Proportion also musical,
it ioynes with the other tvvayne:
So that therein three noble arts,
are exercisde certain.
What game therefore like unto this,
may gotten be or had?
There is not one that I do know,
the rest are all to bad.
It causes no contention this,
nor no debate at all,
By this no hatred wrath nor guyle,
in any wise does fall.
It stirs not such troubles that,
our friend becomes our foe:
It moves not to mischief this,
as many others do.
Let us avoid the vvorst therefore,
and cleue we to the best.
So shall we shun all wickedness,
and purchase quiet rest.
So shall we serve the living Lord,
and walk after his will:
So shall we do the thing is good,
and fly that which is ill.
So shall we live right christianlyke,
and do our duties well:
So shall we please both god and prince,
none shall us need compel.
And then the Lord of his mercy,
will prosper us alvvayes:
And grant us here to have on earth,
full many godly days.
Yea then the Lord of his goodness,
and grace celestial:
Will guide and govern our affairs,
and bless our doings all.
Which Lord grant to your honor here,
good days and long to have:
with much increase of health and wealth
and from all hurt you save.
Your honors most humble, James Roubothum.

To the Reader.
I Dout not but some man of severe judgment so soon as he has ons read ye
title of this book will immediately sai, that I had more need to exhort men to
work, then to teach the^ to play, which censure if it proceed not of such a
froward morositie that can be content with nothing but that he does himself, I
do not only well admit, but also willingly submit my self thereto. And if I
could be persuaded that men at mine exhortation would be more diligent to
labor, I would not only write a treatise twice as long as this, but also
think my whole time well bestowed, if I did nothing else, but invent, speak,
and write that which might exhort, move, and persuade them to the furtherance
of the same. But if after honest labor and travel recreatio^ be requisite,
(and that need no further probation because we favor the cause well enough) I
had rather teach men so to play, as both honestye may be reserved, their wits
exersised, they them selves refreshed, and some profit also attained, then for
lack of exercise to see them either pass the time in idleness, or else to have
pleasure in things fruitles and uncomely. And if great Emperors and mighty
Monarchs of the world have not been ashamed by writing books to teach the
art of Dyceplaying, of all good men abhorred, and by all good laws condemned:
have I not some color of defense, to teach the game, which so wise men have
invented, so learned men frequented, and no good man has ever condemned? The
invention is ascribed to Pythagoras, it bears the name of Philosophers,
prudent men do practice it and godly men do praise it. But because many herein
(as in a play) have challenged much authority, they have filled this game with
much diversity. In which as I could perceive the most differens of playing to
consist in three kinds, so have I plainly and briefly set the^ forth in
English not as though there might not more diversities be espied, but that I
thought these to them whom I have written to be sufficient. yet for that I
would be loathe, from play and game, to fall to earnest contention, if any man
in this doing or any part thereof shall think I have done amiss, and will do
better himself, so far am I from envying his good proceeding, that I will be
right glad, and give him heartye thanks therefore.

All things belonging to this game
for reason you may bye:
At the book shop under Bochurch,
in Chepesyde redilye.
The books verdicte.
VVanting I have been long truly,
In english language many a day:
Lo yet at last now here am I,
Your labors great for to delay,
And pleasant pastime you to show,
Mynding your wits to move I trovve.
For though to mirth I do provoke,
Unto VVisdome yet move I more:
Laying on them a pleasant yoke,
Wisdom I mean, which is the door,
Of all good things and commendable:
Dout this I think no man is able:
CATO.
Interpone tuis interdum gaudia curis:
Vt possis animo quemuis sufferre laborem.
The diffinition
THat most ancient and learned play, called the Philosophers game, being in
Greek termed (...), is as much to say in English, as the battle of numbers.
Numbers be either eue^ or odd, wherefore the even part is against the odd,
either part having a king, which being taken of the adversaries part, and a
triumph celebrated within his camp, the game is ended.

Of diverse kinds of playinge.
Among the diverse kinds of playinge this game, we shall set forth three
sorts, of which the reader may chose whether of them he lyketh best. And of
all those three, we shall give such short and easy rules, that no man
(although he were altogether ignorant in Arithmetike) shall find the game so
hard, but that he may learn to play it.

Of the parts of this Game.
HE that will learn this game, any of the three ways, must first be
enstructed of these six parts. The table as the field.2. the men and the
numbers of them as the host.3. the placynge of them, as the encampinge.4. the
order of play and remouynge the men, as the marchynge and fighting 5. the
manner and laws of conqueryng and taking.6. and last of all the triumph after
the victory,

Of these parts in the first kind of playng.
The table must be a plain board containing.128. squares that is.8. in
breadth and.16. in length set forth in two diverse colors. Or for a
plainer understanding, the table is a doble chesse board, as it were two
chessebordes joined together, the length of two, the breadth of one, whereof
this is an example.



Of the men.
THe men be in number.48. Whereof.24. be of one side and must be known by one
color, and.24. on the other side, which also must be marked with a contrary
color, as White and Black, Blew and Read, or what colors else you like best.
But in the colering these.3. things must be observed, ye bottom or lower part
of every man (except the two kings) must be marked with his adversaries
color, that when he is taken, he may change his coat and serve him unto
whom he is prisoner.

The second thing considered in the men, is their fashion: for of either
side.8. are rounds, other.8. are triangles and.7. (the king making.8) are
squares. There fashion is such roundes triangles squares

The kings because they consist of all three sorts, as it is known by the
learned speculation of the numbers, bear the fashion of all three kinds, his
foundations are two squares, on which are set, two triangles and upon them
rounds. But this difference is between the kings, yt the king of the even
nubers, has a pointed top, the king of ye odd numbers is not pointed, the
cause depends upon ye consideration of there numbers by which they arise into
piramidall fashion. The third thing considered in the men, is the number that
must be written or graue^ upon them which to learn plainly for practice mark
these short rules.

There be of each kind of men, two ranks or orders.

The first rank or order of roundes be ye digites even or odd namely of the
even.2.4.6.8. of the odd.3.5.7.9.

The second order of rounds are found by multiplyinge these digites by
themselves as.2. times.2. is.4.3. times.3. is.9. Of the even they
be.4.16.36.64. of the odd they be.9.25.49, 81.

The first order of the triangles are found by addinge two of the roundes
together one of the first order and another of the second order, as.2. and.4.
make six 3. and.9. make twelve, on the even side they are these.6.20.42.72. on
the odd side.12.30.56.90.

The second order of triangles be made by adding one to every one of the first
order of roundes, and then multiplying that number in him self: as.2. is one
of the first order of roundes, thereto add one, yt is.3. then.3. times.3.
is.9. a triangle of the second order, on the even side. Likewise to three a
round on the odd side, add.1. so is it.4. then.4. times.4. is.16. On the even
part, they be.9.25.49.81. on the odd part.16.36.64.100.

The first order of squares (in which are contained the kings) be made by
adding two triangles together, one of the first order, and another of the
second, as.6. and.9. make.15. likewise 12. and.16. make.28. Among the even
they be.15.45. and.91. the King.153. among the odd they be.28.66.120.
and.190. the King.

The last order of squares be found, by dobling of every one of ye first order
of roundes, and after adding one, last of all by multipling that number in it
self, as twice.2. is.4. and.1. added is.5. so.5. times 5. is.25. likewise
twyse.3. is.6.1. added is 7. then.7. times.7. is.49. These be on the even
side.25.81.169.289. And of the odd side.49.121.225.361.

These numbers must be set upon the men both on the upper side, and also on
the nethersyde. Except one of ye kings, which must with the whole number of
their pyramid, be marked, only on the bottom. Because the sides must have
other numbers, namely the highest point of the even king, must have.1. ye
round next under him mark with.4. the vpermost triangle with.9. the nethermost
with.16. The upper most square must have.25. The nethermost square shall
have.36. The king of the odd upon his head, which is a round, not pointed
has.16. upon his first triangle.25. on the second triangle.36. upon the
first square.49. upon the lowest square.64.

Finally it shall be good for the auoydance of confusion, to draw a line under
every number. Else may you take one for another, as the even round and ye odd
round, may be taken one for another with out this line or some such mark,
likewise and Tryangles both of one side. And this is sufficient for the men,
the fashion, colors and numbers.

The reason of these numbers and the knowledge of their proportione.
FOr them that seek the speculation of these numbers, rather then the practice
for playing, and have some sight in the sciens of Arithmetike, some thing must
be said of proportion. For this purpose there be three kinds of proportion.
Multiplex, superparticuler and superpartiens.

Of multiplex.
MULTIPLEX proportion, is when a great number conteyneth a less number many
times, and leaves nothing, as.8. conteyneth.2 four times and nothing
remains.16. contains.4. etc, this proportion seems best to agree with
roundes because the one number conteyneth the other and nothing remaineeth as
the first order (...) roundes be.



The second order be these.
doble. quadruple. sextuple. occuple.
proportion.
triple. quintuple. septupl. noncuple


Of superparticuler proportion.
SUper particular proportion is when a greater number contains a lesser with
one part of it, which may measure the whole, as.12. contains.9. and 3. which
is a third part of nine.6. conteyneth.4. and.2. that is one half to 4. This
proportion being the chief, next unto multiplex, is best figured by a
trianguler form, which has fewest lines and angles next unto a circle. For
the manner of this proportion consider this figure.

sesquialter. sesquiquart. sesqui. sext. sesqu. oct.
sesquiter. sesquiquint. sesquisept. sesquinona.


Superpartiens proportion.
THE superpartiens proportion is when the greater number contains the lesser
and mo parts of it then one as.15. conteyneth.9. and.6. which is two thirdes
of.9. like wise.28. coteineth.16. and.12. that is 3/4; of.16. This proportion
contains diverse parts beside the whole number therefore is well figured in the
square, which also conteyneth more corners and sides. For the manner of their
proportion consider this table.

The first order of squares.
superparticulres added
being the squares.


The second order follows.
Third fyft seventh ninth 5. 9. 13. 17. 10. 36. 78. 136.



superbipartiens tertias. superquadrupartiens quintas. supersextupartiens
septimas. superoctupartiens nonas

Fourth sixth eight tenth 7. 11. 15. 19. 21. 55. 105. 171.



supertripartiens. quartas. superquintupartie^s. septimas. superseptupartiens.
Octauas. supernonpartiens. decimas.

Of the kings.


THE kings contain in them such numbers, as being all added together, make
the whole piramidall number, the lowest square of the even, is 36. which rises
of the multiplying of.6. in it self. The next square that must be less,
is.25. arisinge by the multiplyinge of five in it self and so follows.16.
of.4 then.9. of.3. last.4. of.2. and single.1. all these added together,
make.91. After the same manner consists the king of odd. The lowest square
is.64. arisinge of.8. multiplied in himself. The next.49. of 7. times.7.
then.36. of.6, 25. of.5. and.16. of 4. these numbers make the whole pyramidall
number.190. which because it rises not to the poynct of one, ought not to be
sharp poyncted, as has been said before.

Of the placing, encamping or setting in araie.
TO return again to the plain and easy playing of this game, next to the
army and their armor, follow either the order of their battle or encamping.
Which because it is more plain and easily seen which the eye, then learned by
the ear, I refer thee unto the table where the battle is appointed in such
order as this kind of Play requires.



Of the marchinge or removing of the men.
THE battle being duly placed, it follows next, to know the manner of
marching and removing, for every kind of men, has their proper kind of
motion, and first we must speak of the roundes.

The motyon of the roundes.
THE roundes must move into the space that is next unto them corner wise, as
in the table, from the space A. to any of these.B.C.D. or.E.

Of the triangles.
THE triangles pass three spaces counting that in which they stand for one,
and that into which they do remove for another, that is leaping over one space.
As from the space.A. he may remove into any of these spaces.F.G.H. or.I. this
is the motion of the triangle in marchyng or taking. But in flying he may
remove the Knights draught of the chesse, as from.A. into.X. or.W. etc.

Of the Squares.
THe Squares remove into the fourth place from them, that is leaping over two,
right forward or sydelong, as from* the place of.A. to any of these spaces.L.
N. P. R. flyinge they may remove after the Knyghts draught, but that they must
pass four spaces, as from.P. to.Y. or.T. etc. And this for the marchinge and
remouyng of the men, where note, that with their flying draughte they can take
no man, but if need be help to besiege a man.

Of the Kings marching.
THe kings because they bear ye form of al ye three kynds, may remove any of
all their draughts when they list, into the next with the round, into the
third with the triangle, and into the fourth with the square, and finally in
all points like the Queen at the Chesse, saving that he can not pass above
four spaces at the most.

Of the manner of taking.
THe men may be taken six ways, namely by Equality, Obsidion, Addition,
Substraction, Multiplication and Division, and also if you will, and soagree,
by Proportion Arithmeticall. Geometrical. Musical.


Of Equality.
BY equality men may be taken, when one man after his motion, sees his enemy
being of the same number that he is, standing in such place as he may remove
into, then may he take away his enemy and not remove into his place, as in
this example.9. a triangle of the eue^ army, after he has removed, espyeth.9.
a round of the odd army, him may he take up and not remove into his place.
But if.9. the triangle, espy nine the round, before he remove, standing in
his draught, he may take him up and remove into his place.

These men may be taken by equality 9.16.25.36.49.64.81. because they are
found in both the armies, and in as much as any man taken being turned with
his bottom upward, and that bears his adversaries colloure, may serve his
enemy on whose side he is taken, there may yet be taken by equality.4. and 6.

Of taking by obsidion.
BY obsidion any man may be taken even the king him self, if he be so
compassed with 4. men, that his law full draught be hindered, as for example
the round standing in the place of.1. and 4. men of what kind it skylleth not,
occupying the places of.2.3.4.5. after you have set your last man in his place
may be taken up, also if a triangle be enclosed, as in.a. with any four me^
standing in.b.c.d.e. he may be taken, even so may a square be taken. Also
Triangles and squares may be beseged, it al ye four me^ or any of them, the
rest standing nearer, do stand in the third or fourth space from them so
that they have no way to remove, as a triangle or square standing in.A. may be
beseged by.4. men or any of them (the rest standing nearer) in.F.G.H.I. Also
a square standing in.A. may be taken by (...), if the four men or some of
them (the rest standing nearer) do stand in L.N.P.R. and this is sufficient
for Obsidion, by which every man may be taken in manner and form as it has
been taught.

Of taking by Addition.
WHen two numbers are so brought that they find one of their enemies, which is
as much as both they being added together, standing in such place as both
they might remove into, they shall take him up, without removing into his
place, so soon as the latter of those two is set down, but if the adversaries
men be in their danger before they remove, one of them whether the player
list, shall be removed into the place of that man which is taken by Addition. As
for example.12. the triangle is in.A. if you can bring six the round, to
stand in.B. and.6. the triangle to stand in.G. because.6. and.6. being added
make.12. and both may remove to.A. you may take up the triangle.12. by
addition. Also.120. the square standing in.P. and.49. the round standing in.B.
or else.49. the square standing in.L. which being added together make.69.
which stands in.A. shall take the said square.169. by Addition.

Of taking by Substraction.
WHen two men do so stand, that the lesser being subtracted out of the
greater, the number remaining, is all one with the adversaries man that
stands in both their draughtes, so soon as the latter is set in his place,
he may take away the adversary, not removing into his place, unless he find
him so before he remove: as for as example, 2. the round standing in.B. and.9.
the triangle standing in.6. shall take their adversary.7. standing in.A.
for.2. out of.9. remains.7. Another example. The round.2. standing in.A.
may be taken by.30. the Triangle standing in H. and the square.28. standinge
in.P. for take.28. out of.30. and their remains.2.

Of taking by multiplycation.
WHen two numbers stand so, that being multiplied one by the other, the
producte is all one with their adversaries man standing in both their
draughts, they may take that man so sone as the latter is placed. And if they
lie so before they remove, being so left of ye adversary, one of them shall
succeed in his place that is taken, as in example. The round.3. stands in.D.
and 5. stands in.E. these two shall take the square 15. standing in.A.
because three times five is.15. another example. The round 2. standing in.B.
and the triangle.6. standing in.I. shall take their enemy the triangle.12.
standing in.A. by multiplycation for.2. times.6. is.12.

Of taking by division.
BY division a man may be taken, when two of his enemies do so stand, that
one of them being divided by the other, the product is the same that their
enemy is, standing in their draught, immediately after the latter is placed,
the enemy may be removed. If he were left in their danger before remouyng,
one of them may remove into his place, an example. The round 4. standing in.D.
and the triangle.20. standing in.F. may take ye adversary.5. standing in.A. by
division, because.4. in.20. is contained.5. times. Another example, the
round.5. standing in B. and the triangle 30. standing in.F. may take their
enemy.6. standing in A. for.5. in 30. is contained.6. times.

Of the taking of the kings.
THe game is never won, until the King be taken. The Kings (as has been
said) may remove any way, so they pass not the fourth space. They can not be
taken by equality. But by obsidion the whole king may be taken away. Also his
whole number at ones, that is.91. or.190. by Addition, by Subtraction, by
Multiplication, or by Division. Also he may be taken by parts, when any of
his side numbers may be taken then leseeth he that draughte, as when any of
his square numbers is gone he can not remove the square draught, and so of the
rest, till nothing of him be left, then must he be taken away, and the triumph
prepared.

The law of prisoners.
WHen any is taken captive, he must be turned with his conquerers collor
upward and placed in the hindermost space of his victors camp, and from thens
being removed must fight against his conquerours enemies, and serve him also to
make his triumph.

By this Table any man though he have small or no skyll in Arithmeticke, may
learn to play at this game, and in playinge learn some part of Arithmeticke.

Of taking by proportion.
IF the Gamesters be disposed, they may take men also by proportion,
Arithmeticall, Geometrical, or Musical. But because it is not necessarily
required that they should so do, I will first prosecute the manner of triumph,
in which also they may learn to take by proportion, as afterward shall be
seen. For when they can join two or three of their men to one of their
adversaries men in such order as the triumph is set, so that those three or
four numbers have any of these three proportions they may take their
adversaries man.

Of the triumph.
WHen the King is taken, ye triumph must be prepared to be set in the
adversaries camp. The adversaries camp is called all the space, that is
between the first front of his men, as they were first placed, unto the neither
end of the table, containing.40. spaces or as some will.48* When you entend to
make a triumph you must proclaim it, admonishing your adversary, that he
meddle not with any man to take him, which you have placed for your triumph.
Furthermore, you must bring all your men that serve for the triumph in their
direct motions, and not in their flying draughtes.

To triumph therefore, is to place three or four men within the adversaries
camp, in proportion Arithmeticall, Geometrical or Musical, as well of your
own men, as of your enemies men that be taken, standing in a right line,
direct or cross, as in.D.A.B. or else 5.1.3. if it consist of three numbers,
but if it stand of four numbers, they may be set like a square two against
two, as in.E.B.D.C. or.2.3.4.5. and after the same manner must you set them so
that your adversaries man make the third or fourth, when you take by
proportion.

Of diverse kinds of triumphs.
THere be three kinds of triumphs a great triumph, a greater triumph, and
the greatest and most noble of all.

Of the great triumph.
THe great triumph stands in proportion, either Arithmeticall, Geometrical,
or Musical only.

Of Arithmeticall proportion.
ARithmeticall proportion, is when ye mydle number differs as much from the
first, as from the third, that is to say, when the third has so many more,
from the second, as the second has from the first, as.2.4.6. Here, two, is
the distans, for.4. excedeth 2. by two, and.6. is more then four by.2.

A rule to find out Arithmeticall proportion between the first and the last.
WHen you have the first and the last if you would find out the middle in
proportion. Add the first and the last together, and divide the whole into 2.
for the half is the middle in proportion as I would know what is the middle
number in proportion between.5. and 25. first I add.5. to.20. that is.30. the
half of thirty is.15. which is middle in proportion between.5. and.30. so have
I.5.15.35. in Arithmeticall proportion.

A table of all the Arithmetical proportions that be in this game.

Of Geometrical proportion.
Geometrical proportion, is when the second has that proportion to the
first, that the third has to the second, as.2.4.8. as.4. excedeth.2. by 2.
so.8. excedeth.4. by.4.

A rule to find the mydle number in Geometrical proportion.
Multiply the first by the third, and of the product find out the root
square, for that is the middle, if the numbers have any root square in whole
numbers. The root square is a number multiplied in it self, wherefore you
must seek such a number, as multiplied in it self, makes ye producte of the
first and the third number multiplied one by the other.

As.20. multiplied by.45. is.900. the root is.30. square, which multiplied in
it self is.900. But if you list not to take such pains, here is a Table
that may serve your turn for Geometrical proportion to be used in this game.

27.

Of Musical proportion.
MUusicall proportion is when the differences of the first and last from the
mids, are the same, that is between the first and the last, as.3.4.6.
between.3. and.4. is.1. between.4. and 6. is.2. the whole difference is.3.
which is the difference between.6. and.3. the first and the last.

A rule to find the first, when you have the two last.
Multiply the second by the third, divide the producte by the distans and the
third number, and the quotient is the first, as having.6. and 12. I would
find the first, 6. times.12. is 72, the difference between.6. and.12. is 6,
which added to.12. is.18, divide.72. by 18. the quotient is.4. so have
you.4.6.12. in Musical proportion.

To find the middle between the first and the last.
Multiply the first by the last, then double the producte, and divide the
whole by the first and the last added together, the quotient is then the mydle
number. As having.6. and.12. I would know the mydle in Musical proportion.
First I multiply one by the other, the product is.72. that doubled is 144,
this divided by.18. which is the addition, of.6. and 12. gives the quotient 8.
so have I.6.8.12. in musical proportion. And thus must you work to find out
the third in musical proportion. But if you had rather play then work, this
table following shall serve your torn.

Of the greater triumph.
THe greater victory is, when four numbers be brought together, which agree
in two proportions, either Arithmeticall and Geometrical, or else
Arithmeticall and Musical, or else Geometrical and Musical. Of these three
conjunctions the greater triumph consists, of the which the table follows.

THe greatest triumph is of Arithmeticall, Geometrical, and Musical
proportions all joined together.

Arithmeticall, Geometrical, and Musical proportions, all together.

And thus is the first kind of playing at an end. And this is sufficient to
teach you to play, but if you would learn to play conningly, you must use to
play often, so shall you learn better then by any precepts or rules.

Of the second kind of playinge at the Philosophers game.
THere is in this kind of playing to be considered, the table, ye men, the
marking of them, the setting of them in array, their marching, their laws of
taking, and the manner of triumphynge.

Of the Table.
THe Table is the same that was first described, namely a double chesbord.

Of the men.
THe men be as before in number 48.23. on a side, and two contrary kings of
even and of odd. They must be of diverse colors, as has been said, the
bottom of every one must have his enemies color, and his own mark of number,
differing in this poinct from the former playing, that the enemies men taken,
may serve only to celebrate a triumph, but not to fight on his side that
takes them.

Of the markyng of the men.
THey be marked with the same numbers, that have been showed before and
therefore so are to be found out as is taught before. But they be marked
beside their numbers, with cossicall signs, which be signs used in the rule
called regula cossa, or algebra, betokening roots, quadrats, cubes,
fouresquared quadrats, sursolides, and quadrates of cubes. All these.6. signs
must be contained in this game.

The sign of the root. {powerof1} of the quadrate. {powerof2} of the cube, or
solid quadrat. {powerof3} of the fouresquared quadrat. {powerof4} of the
sursolide. {powerof5} of the squared cube. {powerof6}


Every number may be taken for a root, as.2. this number multiplied in it
self is a square as.4. The quadrat or square multiplied by the root gives a
cube or solid square, as.4. multiplied by.2. gives.8. that is a cube.
Multiply the cube by the root, so have you a squared quadrat, as.8. by.2.
gives 16. which is a quadrate of a quadrate. Multiply the square or quadrat
of quadrat by the root, and the product is the sursolyde, as.2. times.16.
is.32. which is a sursolide. Multiply the sursolide by the root, and the
product is the quadrate of a cube, as.2. times.32. is.64. which is a quadrat of
a cube. So have you the root quadrat, cube, quadrat of quadrat, sursolide,
quadrat of cube.2.4.8.16.32.64. So.2. referred to.4. is a root of a square,
referred to.8. it is a root of a cube.2. referred to.16. is the root of a
four squared quadrate.2. referred to.32. is the root of a sursolide.2.
referred to.64. is ye root of a quadrate of a cube. These numbers must have
the proper cossicall signs. Also one number having diverse relations, may have
diverse cossical signs, as 9. referred to.81. being root, has the sign of a
root {powerof1}, but being referred to.3. it has the sign of a quadrate, for
it is a quadrate of.3. and is thus signed. {powerof2}. and so of the rest that
have like relation.

The marking of the men.
THe first order of roundes in both numbers, must have the sign of the root
upon them al after this manner.

8 {powerof1}
6 {powerof1}
4 {powerof1}
2 {powerof1}
9 {powerof1}
7 {powerof1}
5 {powerof1}
3 {powerof1}


THe second order of roundes found out as before, be not all marked with
cossicall signs, but only.4. and.9. with the root, and.81. with the
quadrate. The rest have none, because among their adversaries men there is
none that can be cossicall root to them in such manner as this game requires.

64.
36.
16
4 {powerof1}
81 {powerof2}
49
25
9 {powerof1}


THe first order of triangles (having the same numbers that have been taught
before) do all lack the cossicall signs, except only.6. which is signed with
the root.

72.
42.
20
6 {powerof1}
81
56
30
12


THe second order of triangles, have all except one (which is the number
of.100.) their cossicall signs, as 9. both of the root and of the quadrate,
25.36. and.49. have the sign of the quadrate.64. of the quadrate and the cube,
and also the quadrat of cube.16. and.81. of the quadrate, and the four squared
quadrate.

81 {powerof2}.{powerof4}
49 {powerof2}
25 {powerof2}
9 {powerof1} {powerof2}
100
64 {powerof1}. {powerof3} {powerof6}
36 {powerof2}
16 {powerof2} {powerof4}


In the first order of squares, only 15. is marked with the root, all the
rest do want their cossicall signs in this game.

153.
91
45
15 {powerof1}
190
120
66
28


THe second order of squares has.3. numbers marked with cossicall signs,
that is.25. and.225. with the sign of the quadrate.81. is marked with the
sign of the quadrate and the foure-squared quadrate.

289.
169.
81 {powerof2}. {powerof4}
25. {powerof2}
361.
225. {powerof2}
121.
49.


And thus have you all the men that be marked with cossicall signs.

The setting in array.
THe teachers of this kind of playing, do not so well allow, the former
kind of placing or any other, as the natural placing of every man under him
of whom he aryseth. So they conteyne.6. ranks in length, extending to the
furthermoste edge of the Table after this sort.



The marching or moving.
THe men may remove every way, into void places, forward, backewarde,
toward both sides, direct or cornerwyse. So that the round men remove into
the next space, the triangles into the third place, and the squares into the
fourth place, accompting that place in which they stand for one.

Also every man saving the two kings to besiege his enemy, or to fly from
the siege him self, may remove the knights draught in chesse, but neither take
any man (except it be by siege) nor erect a triumph by such motions. The
kings move even as squares, but that they have not the flyinge draughte.

It is compted lawefull among such as will so agree, that the Triangles and
Squares, may remove into void places, though the spaces between be occupied
of other men.

The manner of taking.
THe men may be taken seven ways by Obsidion, by Equality, by Addition, by
Substraction, by Multiplication, by Division, and by Cossicall Signs.

Of taking by Obsidion.
ALl men may be taken by Obsidion when by four men they be let of their
ordinary draughte, as has been taught before.

Of taking by Equality.
BY Equality may these men take or be taken, as has been said before,
9.16.25.36.49.64.81, as if after you have played your.9. you see your
adversaries.9. stand in your man's draught, you may take him up not remouyng
into his place, unless you espy him standing in your draught before you
play, then must you take him up and remove into his place.

Of taking by Addition.
THe taking by Addition is all one with the first kind of play, in all
respects, saving that some require the men that should take by Addition to
stand in the next spaces to him that is taken, either directly, or cornerwyse,
but the former way is better.

Of taking by substraction.
THat which was said in the first kind of substraction and that which was
last said of Addition may be both referred hither. For this substraction
differs not from the former, but for the opinion of them, that would have the
two takers stand only in the next spaces to him that is taken.

Of taking by Multiplication.
Taking by multiplication does differ. For in this kind of playng, it is thus.
When your man stands so, that being lesser then your adversaries man, you may
multiply your man by the void spaces between them, and the product is all one
with the aduersarye, you may take him up, not remouynge into his place, except
you espy him so, before you remove your man.

Of taking by Division.
Likewise by Division, if your man being greater then the aduersarye, stand
so, that being divided by the void spaces, the quotient is all one with the
aduersarye, you may take him up, not remouyng into his place, unless you see
him so standing before you draw.

Of taking by Cossicall signs.
BY Cossicall signs any man that has these signs, {powerof2} {powerof3}
{powerof4} {powerof6}. meeting with his root in his ordinary draught that has
this sign {powerof1}. takes him up, or else is taken of him, without
remouyng into his place, except he may take him before he remove.

Of the Kings, and their taking.
THe King of the even must be four square, having six steps, every one
losser then other, on one side he must have on him these roots.1.2.3.4.5.6.
on the other side the quadrates arising of these rots, that is 1.4.9.16.25.36.
The King of the odd men, must have but five steps, that is.4.5.6.7.8.
lackyng the roots that he can not end in.1. The quadrates of his roots be
these.16.25.36.49.64. These must be so set on, that the least must be highest
and the greatest lowest.

The Kings be taken by Obsidion, or if their Pyramidall number, be taken by
any of the aforsayde means. Also if by such means you can take all his
quadrates one after another.

The privilege of the King.
IF any of the Kings quadrates be taken, he may redeem it by any of his men
having the same number, and must remove into his place, which redeemed him.
But if he have none of the same number, he may redeem him for any man of his,
that his aduersarye will choose, and likewise remove into his place by whom he
is redeemed.

Of the triumph.
THe triumph is after the King be clean taken away, to be created in the
adversaries camp, as well of your own men as of your adversaries men that be
taken, or of both in proportion as has been showed before, and proclaimed that
those men ons placed, may not be taken, as it was declared sufficiently, and no
difference between the triumphs, saving that some will not allow a triumph
but of four numbers, and two proportions at the lest. All three for the
greater victory, making but two kynds of triumphs.

Here follows the third kind of playing at the Philosophers game.
THere must also in this third kind be considered the table, the men, their
markyng, the order of their battle, the motions, their taking, and last of all
their triumphing.

The table is the same that has been twyse already discribed. Yet some will
not have it so long, but at the lest it must conteyne.10. squares in length
and always.8. in breadeth. The longest is best.

Of the men.
THe men be.48. as it has been said of two contrary collor, the head and
bottom all of one collor, because men ons taken be no more occupied in this
kind of playing.

The inscription and fashion.
THe fashion is as has been last declared both of the men, and of the kings,
the inscription of numbers the same, but without cossical signs.

Of the order of the battle.
THe order of battle is after the first manner, but not so far from the
bordes end, namely the.4. squares standing in the plattes nearest to the
bordes end the rest accordingly joined to them, as in the first kind of
playing.



Of their motions.
THe men move froward and backward, to the right hand, and to the left hand,
but not cornerwise, except the gamesters so agree, the rounds into the next
space, ye triangles into the third, and the squares into the fourth, the kings
move as squares. And these be their ordinary draughts in marching.

Of their taking.
THey are taken by encountering, by eruption, by laying wayght, and by Obsidion.

Of taking by encou^tering.
TO take by encountering is to take by Equality, as has been twyse before
declared.

Of taking by eruption.
TO take by eruption is when a less number being multiplied by the spaces that
are between him and his adversary, ye product is as much as his adversary, he
may take his enemy away whether he stand directly from him or cornerwise.

For men that may be taken by eruption look in the table of taking by
multiplication in the second kind of playing.

Of taking by deceypt or lying weight.
TO take by deceypt or lying weight, is to take by addition, not as before when
the adversary stands within the draught of two men which being added make the
just number of the adversary, but when the.2. numbers that are to be added,
stand in the next spaces to the adversary. For to take by deceit, look in
the table that was set forth for taking by addition in the first kind of
playinge.

Of taking by Obsidion.
BY Obsidion all men may be taken, when four men besiege the aduersarye,
standing in the four next spaces about him directly, or cornerwise, the man
so besieged can not escape, because he can not remove cornerwyse, therefore
may be taken up, so soon as the last of the four is set in his place.

In all three kinds of playing no Obsidion can be of any man with some of his
fellows, but all four must be his adversaries.

In this third kind, these men can be none otherwise taken but by Obsidion.
Namely among the even.2.4.4.135. among the odd.3.5.7.190.

In all manner of taking this is to be noted, that we must not place the man
which takes in place of him that is taken, but when he may be taken before we
draw, then shall we remove our man into his place.

The privilege of the king.
THe king stands for so many men as he has steps, that is the even for.6.
the odd for.5. if any of these (except the lowest and greatest) be taken the
king may redeem him, by any man of his that is of the same number. If he have
none of the same number, he may redeem him by any of his men that his
adversary will choose. But if his lowest square be taken, no ransom will deliver
him. Also if the whole king at ons that is the whole number of Pyramid be
taken, he can not be redeemed.

Of the triumph.
TO take away the tediousnes of long play from them that be young beginners,
writers of this game have invented diverse kinds of short victories, wherefore
they divide victory into proper and common. Of the proper victory need nothing
here be spoken, for all things thereto belonging are sufficiently set forth in
ye first kind of playing.

Of the common victory.
THe common victory (they say) is after five manners, for men contend either
for bodies, goods, quarelles, honor, or else for both quarrels and honor.

Uictory of bodies,
VIctory of bodies is only to take a certain number of men, as if the gamesters
agree, that he which first takes 4.02.5.02.6.02.10. men etc, shall win the
game.

Uictorye of goods.
Victory of goods, is to take a certain number without respect of the men. As if
it be couenanted, that he which first takes men amou^ting to ye number of.100.
or.200. shall have the victory.

Uictory of quarrel.
Victory of quarrel is when neither the men, nor the number, but the
characters of the number be considered. As if it be determined that he which
first takes.100. in.8. characters not regarding in how many men they stand,
shall win. As.2.4.6.8.24.64. so you have.100. in.8. characters it skilleth
not, although there be more then.100. as in this example there is more
then.100. by.4.

Uictorie of honor.
Victory of honor, is when a determined number is made in a determined number
of men, as if it be determined that he which first comes to.100. in.8. men,
shall win the game. As in these.2.4.6.8.4.16.45.15. And though there were
somewhat more then 100. so it be in.8. men, it skilleth not.

Of victory of honor and quarrel.
THe victory of honor and quarrel, is when one obteyneth the decreed number,
in the decreed number of men and the decreed number of characters: as let.100.
be the decreed number 8. the determined number of men, and 9. the determined
number of characters, He that obteyneth.2.4.6.8.4.6.9.64. obteineth the
victory of honor and quarrel. It shall be no hinderance though.8. men and.9.
caracters conteyne somewhat more then.100. so that there be not.100. upon one
man, as in the victory before.

Uictorie of standers.
THey have invented another victory, that is of standerdes, by counterfeyting
two armies, one of the Christians, another of the Turks. The white men, that
is the even host, conteyneth.1312. footmen (not compting the roots of
squares expressed in the kings) let the first and last be captains and let
them divide the whole army into.10. standerds so every standerd shall
have.130. men, beside the two captains and the ten standerd bearers. The black
men, yt is the odd army (except ye kings roots) be.1752. The two captains
and ten standerd bearers taken out, there remains.1740. souldyers, to every
standerd.174. He that wynneth more standers has the victory. If the even
host wine.348. men he has obtained two sta^derds if he win.522 he has
gotten three standerds and forth of the rest.

If the odd army win.260. they wyn two standerds.390. three standerds and
so of the rest.

A Table of the victory of standerds.
One standerd of ye even, conteyneth. 130. Two standerds. 260. Three standerds.
390. Four standerds. 520. Five standerds. 650. Six standerds. 780. Seven
standerds. 910. Eight standerds. 1040. Nine standerds. 1170. Ten standerds.
1300. One sta^derd of the odd, conteyneth. 174. Two standers. 348. Three
standerds. 522. Four standerds. 696. Five standerds. 870. Six standerds.
1044. Seven standerds. 1218. Eight standerds. 1392. Nine standerds. 1566. Ten
standerds. 1740.

YOu may use any of these six kinds of common victory, in every one of the
three kynds of playing.
