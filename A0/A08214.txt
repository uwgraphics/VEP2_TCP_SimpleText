He bideth captiued therein everlasting.

Of all these Perrels great and small /
Take-heede with all your Thought and Might /
Have nothing common therewith at-all.
But Psalm. 1.2.

In the Service of Love / and by her Nation bright /
Hold you alone, continually ye shall.

Yet exalt not your Hearts therein / in any-wise:

Ne rob nothing from him at any time.

take the place:
Also the Sects / of Works most-fell /
Respect the same now therefore well: now therefore well.
