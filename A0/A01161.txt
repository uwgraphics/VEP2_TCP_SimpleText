THE HISTORY OF FRANCE: THE FOUR First Books.

LONDON Printed by John Windet. 1595.

TO THE RIGHT EXCELENT and virtuous Lady, the Lady Anne Countess of Warwick:
and to the right Noble, and worthy Lady, my Lady and Mistrisse, Katherine,
Barons Howard of Essingham; and to the rest of the illustrious Ladies of her
sacred Majesty's most Honorable privy Chamber.
IF in this Epistle, (Excellent Ladies) I contain not my style within the
bounds of brevity, let the large scope which the field of your virtues
proffereth, be a sufficient excuse to my imputed blame: if in the course of
the work, which this Epistle presents to your Patronage, multitude of errors
have been ouerslipped, yet I humbly beseech it be so much graced by your
beauty, as what is good may be acceptable unto you, and my infirmities which
are most may with all other (who be they never so great, are or have been
servants to some in your place) for your sake lie covered, my weakness being
the more augmented, in that my pen is so mere a stranger to my profession,
entertayning it only, and that rarelye to overcome that Idleness of time,
which to my self is over familiar, rather in wast and void papers exercising
the fame, then fit for any end or purpose. Among which a few parcells have
^^ne Translated by me some years since unseen or unthought of and had still so
continued, had J not (Noble Countess) been by those which had full power over
me otherwise enjoined. Wherein I have sooner chosen to eternise my own
insufficiency, the render their perfections any ways unsatisfied. And
therefore have made choice to publish these four first Books by an unknown
(without name, but a most just and faithful) Author, at the first digested in a
foreign tongue, wherein J must needs yield to add so much more to my own
imperfectness, as shall come within the view of your eyes, or ponder of your
judgment, as then receiving most blemish, when you shall vouchsafe the Author
in his own and proper language: Who cannot in himself but much satisfy such
is his style, judgment, truth and variety of matter, wherein the mind of man
most delighting, does undoubtedly covet History, before all other writings,
and if History what more pleasing then is in him contained? So many events and
alterations disclosed; secret disseins, and intentions of mighty Princes
revealed; Emperors not enduring equality, Kings disdained, swelling wars,
treacherous truces, Popes practisers, and triumphing in periuries, general
Councels disauowed, Empires voluntarily resigned, princes murdered, Crowns
usurped, Popes deposed, Rome beseaged, his holiness and Cardinals in danger to
be hunger starued, descriptions of Cities, Towns, Castles and fortes,
representations of Royal armies, Inundations, Plagues, Earthquakes, famines,
and other Gods wrathful judgments, Sects and Scismes in hollie Churches, hot
persecutions, Religion made a Couerture to faction and ambition: the self same
Kings at one instant prosecuting in their own Realms, what in person they
assisted, and protected in the Empire; with the true cause, root and
foundation of all the miseries, which the state of Christendom at this day, and
since fifty years has endured; under the discourse of the French estate,
ouerrunning al worthy occurents of Europe, Turkey, and America: A History
though modern, and familier to many now living Actors therein yet yielding
precedence, for matter, method, knowledge and judgment, to none, but thee
triumphant Tacitus, sacred Emperors lying subject to thy pen, and the mightiest
Monarchy of the earth, to thy censure. As my poor travails (which most of all
kept me from being willing to diuulge the same) obscured by thy stately Sauile.
Exquisite Sauile honor to thy University, though in thy virtue an enemy to
me, ouerdropping and shadowing my endeavors, as the high broad Oak does young
and tender sproutes, wrong not thy self and country with longer silence of thy
pen, proud in thy Author, proud in thy Saint, and not least proud in the
commender of thy work, thy A. B. thy secret and haughty Mecaenas, disguised
in the two first letters, the whole Alphabet not being enough to set forth his
worth, but he may not so escape in a shaddowe, his eloquence discovers his
Art, his judgment his experience, and his experience (in having assaulted the
dreadfullst Monarch of our world, to the very gates of his chiefest City,)
has confirmed his valor, to his never dying glory. But how much the more
naked I stand frustrate of countenance, subject to errors, and so thorough
error to reprofe, (as whatsoever is mine can be no other worth, so much more
(high and worthy Countess) does the power of your patronage in my protection,
extend it self, and the grace of your favor in vouchsafing the reading of this
work unworthy only by my own unableness, to set it forth unto you like it
self. The subject whereof, though lofty in mannaging the glorious actions of
anointed Sovereigns, and representing the fierce exploits of unmerciful and
bloody wars, can no ways yet be strange, or dissonant to your ears,
daughter to so great an Earl of Bedford, grave Councellor, commander and
governor, sometimes of that Royal town and Garrison, which bordereth on the
Scottish soil: and dear wife to that redoubted Ambrose, Earl of Warwick,
expert and faithful Councellor, (Son to so puissant and Magnanimious a Duke)
his name, his fame, his valor resounding in foraine Regions, while he had the
honor to be commander and Lieutenant general over a Royal English army,
by your birth and Marriage seeming to be chosen, and consecrated to Mars
himself, happy in father, more happy in husband, but most happy in your
Sovereigns grace, ornament of her Court, true pattern of piety, devotion,
charity and virtue.

And you (Excellent Mistrisse) to whom as well for your honor, bounty and
favors, my fruits and Labors are most due; as having first undertaken the
same, eating of your bread, vouchsafe your Patronage, and disdain not my
Authors English weed, who presents his attendance upon your Person, at such
time as wearied with other occasions, you are accustomed to retire your self
to your Books and Muses. Verified is that in you, that never, Les alone; then
when most alone, for the more part spending your vacation of time, either in
Meditation of holy letter, or conference and reading of some notable and
famous History, which whether it treat of peace, policy, war, or martial
exploits, can hardly discover ought, new or strange unto your wisdom, the one
by your high place, long services, and Courtelie conversation, made familiar
unto you, the other by nothing more, then the signal acts, and heroical
prowes of Magnanimious and victorious Charles, your Lo. and husband, true
patriot, careful Councellor, vigilant commander, rightly and justly dear to
his Sovereign and Country, dreadful to the enemy, terror to traitors, and
scourge of Spanish Monarchy, which the defeat of that invincible army, (for
so in Print the^seues published) can best testify, the glory whereof can not
but stir up those two young Jmpes of great hope and expectation, (over whom
you have ever been a careful Cornelia) as well to succeed their renowned
Father, in his virtues (which never shall perish) as other his human dignities
and possessions; whereof if you shall not in this History have the like
proffered to your view, (for no age has left any such record) yet contemn not
the reading of my Author, by whom you shall receive the true first motive of
all the Civil and foraine wars of France in our age, and her neighbor
Countries: with such memorable accidents and occurents, as continually were
ministered. Not like to that impudent, though excellent writer, Paulus Iouius,
no less worthy to be a Bishop, then a Historiographer, who plainly auerred,
nay was not ashamed himself in his Books to vaunt, how he made no accounte in
writing a lie, were it in matter of consequence, or to please the appetite of
great ones, which should set him a work: for that where there was one in his
time, which knew the fault from the truth, all posterity hereafter would
notwithstanding believe and give credit to what he should set down, my Author
contrariwise, has been so little tickled with the covet of reward or
ambition (capital enemies to the truth) as that he refuses to set his own
name to his so painful labors, mildely and with such great temperance
ouerrunning the proceedings of all enemies, as he cannot justly be suspected
of any partial leaning to the one side more then the other, wishing for my own
part that some one there were (according to my taste given) who in this scribbling
age (whereof translating humors and quoters are plenty) would finish out the
rest, many fragments and sundry Books yet lying by me (as I once intended,
but since, through an accident that happened) in a pelt flong away my pen,
confining what I had done, (as I then thought) to utter darkness, weary of
giving Liueries to other men's retayners, like a conceyted builder, rather
delighted with an inferior model of his own framing, then to rough-cast, or
adorn a more goodly and sumptuous palace left unto his hands, reserving my
self to somewhat (though simplier) of my own hammering and digesting, which
the project already being fausied, time may finish and peradventure bring to
light, if fear of receiving foil by that illustrious Camden, do not
otherwise withdraw my humorfoyle, yet honor enough to be an imitator, and
carrier of thy Books, (Precious and curious Camden) thy own Country prints
not sufficient to extend thy name, worthy to find Kings thy nurcing fathers,
and Queens thy nurses; rare Jewel of Britain land, enemy to inglorious
oblivion, tresurer of memory, trumpet of Albyons fame, register of Antiquity
and poursiuant of eternity.

It now rests (glorious and beautiful Ladies) adorned with your stately
rank and place, humbly to intercesse pardon for my presumption in seeking so
boldly to shrowde the infirmities of my pen, under the shadow of your wings.
And that it will please you to grace with your general safe conduct this my
new English Denizen to pass from place to place, (free from any Menippean
search) until he may make his rende-uous in some contemplative, or retired
hands, who though he now seem Clownish and Rogish like, yet notwithstanding in
his own Country guise, is well esteemed of, and very commendable. In which
albeit many of you be singularly well able to judge of him, yet if it please
any of the rest, to vouchsafe to entertayne his broken English, I dare assure
that for his discourse, you shall find him very delightful, for his news not
ordinary, and for his truth can bring good security, when soever he may be
permitted to attend upon your leisure, not importioning his access, until
weried with your more weighty and serious services, a desire may possess you,
insteede of recreation, to spend with him some few hours of the day. A matter
heretofore accustomed (in my knowledge) by many high and lofty Ladies, who
often times to be meet with wearisomnes, exercised themselves in study, and
reading of worthy writers, as Marguerite Countess of Lennox, Anne Countess
of Oxford, Francis Countess of Sussex, Elizabeth Countess of Lincoln, the
Lady Marie Sydney (living my thrice honored mistress) truly liberal and
bountiful, rare Mother of so heroical an offspring, by her noble mind and
carriage easily discovering greatness of birth and Princely parentage; and that
wise good, and godly Lady aduancer of so many excellent personages, both in
Art and Arms, employing her credit with her Sovereign, (then whom none had
greater) in doing good offices, for all sorts in general, but especially
preferring those, in whom she might perceive any signification of virtue to
appear. That grave Matron, harmless Courtier, and faithful servant Francis
Barons of Cobham, (late wife to the noble L. and trusty Councellor yet
living) to whom I was so much bound (in many duties being likewise to the
whole house) as that both in her health and languishing Malady, she sundry
times admitted me, to confer or read with her, finding in the
Ecclesiastical History her most delight. But no ways may I here without
extreme note of gross oversight pretermit in this lift, that famous Religious
and learned Lady (flower of her family,) provident mother, blessed in her
posterity, Mildred Barons of Burghlie, besides her knowledge in the Latin
letters, (wherein of a subject she excelled) such were her studies, exercises,
and continual Meditation in the Greek Doctors of the Church, (especially
Basil, Ciril, Chrysostom and Nazianzene,) as a chief reader in that tongue (
Laurence by name) has ere now confessed unto me, that in his judgment she
Egalled if not ouermatched any, in whose profession (as expected so) most was
to be required. Neither were these excellent parts of hers, only Theoricall,
but still put in practice like an other Dorcas, full of piety and good works,
as without any ostentation or (...), besides her readiness in soliciting for
poor and distressed suitors unto her dear Lo. (the ancients Councellor of
Europe, Pater Patriae, pillar of the state, thorough whose prudent policy,
and careful watchings justly may be applied, Neque periculum in R. P. fuit
grauius unquam, noc maius otium) in her life time setting on her own charge so
many poor aworke, her exhitition to Scholars, liberallitie to Universities,
bounty to exiled strangers, and her most abounding charity every quarter to
all the prisons about London has manifestly declared; I hope that in so long
insisting upon the virtues of this Lady and others, I shall not be misliked,
for insinuation, less fear to be suspected, namelesse like my Author and yet
if known most will confirm, that Non mihi promptum in adulationes ingenium.
But I have the rather presumed of your patience, in delighting of these
honorable personages, to the end to incite you to tread in their steps, and
imitate their examples. Such as you are, were they, and such as they now are,
shall every one of you be, who though they seem faded, and as it were
vanished from among us, yet does their goodness, and memory still remain
fresh and fixed in the minds and hearts of many.

But how can it otherwise fare (Illustrious Ladies) but that you must needs
succeed, or rather abound in all or greater worthiness having the honor and
bliss to be trained up, in the same School, from the which they (and all
other) borrow their light as the Moon does from the Sun, at the mouth of that
divine Oracle, Ex cuius ore, melle dulcior fluit oration, that sacred Queen,
vnmachable and victorious Virgin, Supereminens omnes, Man's mirror, Jove's
darling, worlds wonder, and natures perfection, whose Angelical face so often
as I do behold, (as behold to often I can not) me thinks J still (with
daseled eyes) see as it were in full aspect Solarem Maiestatem, cum Saturnina
grauitate.

That the powerful and essential thing of things, may number the peaceable
years of her Reign like the sands of the Sea, that the shadow gonne down in
the Dyall of Ahaz, may be ten and ten degrees brought backward, that the Sun
abide, and the Moon stand still, until she may be avenged of her enemies. Let
all her Subjects pray, our age rest thankful, posterity admire, and the
heavens eternise her name for ever.

The History of France.
THE FIRST BOOK.
NOw that those our Actions are most worthy of praise, which can both please
and profit together, wherein a History ought to have the advantage to excel
all other, I do not well know, and though I did, hardly could I tell, whether in
representing unto you the estate of France, and nations neighbors unto it,
since fortye years past I might do a general pleasure, considering the
malice, envy, and diversity of judgments of every man. True it is, that if
I be not deceived through the self liking of my own labor, the truth herein
so clearly represented, the free desire of every ones profit in sundry sorts,
the variety and notable euente of so many accidents do sufficiently promise
unto me a gracious acceptance, even at the hands of the more gentle and
better understanding sort of strangers, who being far from my knowledge, and
thereby less tickled with envy, (an ordinary compagnion of the living) shall
be more rightly able to judge of my labors. I do less doubt, how small or
much pleasing soever the first Treatises of this History shall be, but that all
will even hasten to see the progress and issue thereof, some allured thereunto
through the pleasure, which the diversity of so strange and memorable an
Argument offers unto them, and other of a curiositye praise worthy, to be
willing to know the meruailes of Gods judgments, the great hatreds and small
charity: So many peaces broken, so many wars renewed, so strange cruelties,
so small favors: in sum all the Potentates of christendom at banding for, and
against the French, who most miserably have made themselves the fool in the
play, and the unhappy end and variable reencounter of more rare miseries, then
ever worldlings did practice. I clean contrary knowing the very causes and
means through which we have been cunningly led to such pouertye, endeavor
as much as possibly I may, to estrange from my self the consideration of so
miserable effects, and fetch my history from more high, reaching somewhat
beyond the beginning of our civil wars, where wandering in a true discourse
of foreign affairs, and such as are common unto us, with our neighbors; I
seek the recompense of my pains. In this chiefly that as master of my
self, I command my own affections for a while, to forget our calamities
passed, from which I may boldly borrow so much leisure as I shall esteem
necessary, to turn away for a season so sorrowful and pitious a
remembrance, as thereby I am howrely put in mind of: and albeit the memory of
such greefes ought not any ways to cause a virtuous disposition to swerve from
the truth, no more then the friendship of some, hatred of other, or respect of
great personages should do, and though he is very rarelye to be found, which
is not spyed in the end: if not throughlye gained, yet at the least tempted by
some one of these passions, especially in so confuse, grave, and deep a
matter: I will notwithstanding be found so little partial as all men shall
have more cause in other matters to disgrace me, then in the truth of such
accidents as are here set forth: which if they shall bring a form of a more
agreeable setting forth, either by the number of strange occurrents, or
exceeding by a more excellency of delivery, the rudenes of my natural
language: howsoever it be, so far am I from envying so great a benefit to
those of my age, that I shall hold my self for well satisfied, when I shall
not gather any other profit of my long watchings, then to see my self at the
end of so great travails, to have undertaken more for the pleasure of others,
then my own particular. And now that among Historiographers my name rests as
obscured, their high valor and number which are able to shadow the light, will
bring me some comfort: joined therewithal is, that my quality holding more of
action then of contemplation, does dispense with me to make any profession of
writing, but in matter of consequence wherein I am most delighted: which being
the cause that I best judge of my insufficiency: for being able to conduct and
profit so laboursome a travail, I will call upon his grace which is able to
bless the beginning, pursuit, and last end of such a labor.

Being then resolved to lay before your eyes the estate of France and her
neighbors since fortye pears passed, and considering how the causes of
human accidents are maintained by an eternal bond, and known of few
people, I thought I should make my work a great deal more commendable, if I
did fetch the matter from more high, though not from the first spring, yet at
the least from the more apparent occasions which have brought forth so strange
occurrents. For when I should entreat but of the wars between Charles the
Emperor, and Philip his son, against the Kings of France, or of the change
of Religion throughout Christendom, or of the Seditions that ensued thereon, I
should work you very small pleasure and less profit, in laying down these
matters so rawly unto you, leaving in the mean time undiscovered, the root
and cause of these great ones enmities: the beginning and progress of the
reformation, the pains and pursuites against such as were wilful in the
faith, when, whence, and how the Lutherans were dispersed throughout the whole
world, by what means and success they have been maintained against the
Catholics in every Country: together with the motife and conduite which both
the one and the other pretended to bring, to the defense of the true and
ancient religion. And hereby in showing you the beginnings and preparatiues of
the stomacking wars among the Christians, I shall make you to judge how the
most notable broyle which ever was seen in Christendom, had his beginning
from the diversities of opinions, in the explanation of the religion of our
Fathers. To the maintenance of which, the persecutions which were ordained and
pursued against the more steadfast in their faith, have brought forth less
troubles in all sorts of virtues, but much greater be it in quantitye or
quality of vices, yea surpassing all misfortune, number, and variety of
notable accidents, all the wars which ever our ancestors had against their
neighbors: as the narration of the pitiful effects both of the one and
the other worldly passion shall make apparent unto you, if you will patiently
abide the reading thereof until the end.

The peace which was concluded between Charles 5. Emperor, The state of
France and countries adjoining from the year 1544.
and Frauncis the first, together with that which ensued at Ardres between
Henry 8. K. of England, and the K. of France, maintained as well the estates
and subjects of these Princes, as of sundry other Christians which by alliance,
neighborhood, or other duty of friendship communicated with their passions, in
such rest and advantage, as all esteemed themselves happy of their present
ease, considering their toils passed: every one rejoicing so much more, as
having suffered a world of miseries, under the continuance of so long and
cruel wars, they had even fully persuaded themselves that the immortal
hatreds of their Sovereigns, would utterly envy the coming of so greatly a
desired peace: led hereunto, for that finding their heart burns grounded
upon a slight enough despite, yea more ambitious then reasonable, they often
enough saw them counseled by those, who having naught else the^ their
Masters pleasure and their own particular before their eyes, represented unto
them but an appearance of good: The beginning of wars and miseries among
christians.
the pursuit whereof being always unfortunate to subjects, brought only honor
and profit, to such as full cunningly knew how to make their own markets. But
such was the eternal providence, or to speak naturally, the indiscreet
lightness of the French, joined with a too vain ambition of their neighbors,
drawing from so evil guided a passion, a lamentable spring of all our miseries
to come, that so young a peace could not be suffered to wax old among the
Christians, who too ticklish in their ease, and as it were leaping with a
desire of new cha^ges, seemed to seek nothing else the^ an occasion how to free
themselves from this rest, which already seemed too noisome unto the^. Now as
according to the infinite reencounter of human accidents, they could not long
want matter to entertain the fire of their ancient enmities, the occurrence of
the protection of Parma presented it self but too soon to heat the well
near tempered affections of these Princes, of their people and allies, by a
new motion which so greatly changed their counsailors hearts, not yet full cooled
of their burning enmities, that there needed no long time to persuade them to
make warn, and fall together by the ears with greater stomach then ever.
Behold the very chief occasions.

The ancient hatreds between the Spaniards and French, grounded upon the
pretense of Naples, Milan, Flaunders, Burgundy, Wars begun between the
French and Spanish.
and sundry other rights (for the maintenance whereof so much Christian blood
has been shed) revived between Frauncis the first, and Charles of Austria, and
continued for light enough occasions, were no less entertained through the
envy of the glory which the French achieved, at the memorable defeat of (at
their times) the invincible Swissers at Marignan, the conquest of Milan, and
sundry other great advantages happened to the Flowredeluce, then the jealousy
of the honor and and advancement, which Charles got at such time as the seven
Electors of Germany bestowed upon him (to be meet with the French) the title
and sovereign power of Emperor over the Christians: and since being tooth and
nail pursued by the ambitious and sturdie nature of these two, though young,
yet the greatest Princes of Christendom, there ever fell out such store of
matter to nourish this fire of enmity, that one could not but judge it
eternal, if Charles had not first showed both to the Princes of his own time
and to come, as well by his succession to the goods and rights of his
ancestors, as by his voluntary resignation of his estates, and free retreat
into a solitary life void of the pranckes of this world, how one ought to
take and leave hatreds, rather with discretion then blind passion or advise of
evil counselors, into which almost all Lords, by indiscretion, faintnes of
heart, or other insufficiency, suffer themselves to be but too much led.
Charles notwithstanding was cunning, The nature of Charles 5.
a dissembler, a great husband as well in the expense of his time, as treasure,
patient, staide and well settled, courageous in adversity, discreat in his
words and actions, of a good and strong stature, scorning the outward gloryes
and shows of the world, having for counterpease of his good parts, the
indisposition of his person, self will in his own opinion, and the wealth of
his estate for the end of his actions, more then reason, honor or justice, what
ever could be alleged unto him to the contrary. Frauncis on the other side

apparel, buildings, and other outward things, royal in perfourmance of his
word, valiant, courageous, a great friend to learning and other rare matters,
but blemishing his praiseworthy parts with too sudden a change of opinion,
and and too free credit giving to such as he had lightly enough chosen for his
chief favorites, no less then by worldly pleasure, which carrying him to
the fruition of things corporal and fleshly, shortened the course of his life,
which otherwise could not choose but have been very long; considering the
estate of his person, and a reasonable good form of diet which he held by
the advice of his Physicians. Both of them friends to the people, whom they
would not ouercharge but in great necessity, courageous, ambitious, yea to
have imagined each one in their own conceit, to have had the Empire of the
world, alike frended of Fortune, if you compare the losses which Charles
sustained at Metz, in France, in Affricque, and els-where, with the
imprisonment of Erauncis, they both left their children heirs to some of their
virtues, as well as of their wealth and passions: but much surpassing them in
yielding credit to their counselors, to whom they meerelye referred the
resolution of good or bad, which sometimes they too much put in practice for
their own particular, as well as for the good of the estate. Of which leaving
unto the history to discover the ouer-plus unto you, I will but deliver the
matter of Parma, which reviving their half dead contrariety of affections,
seemed unto them a sufficient occasion and fit means to be thoroughly revenged
of whatsoever had been before passed.

Pope Paul 3. had exchanged certain of the church lands, by the consent and
ratification of the College of Cardinals, with Parma and Plaisance, in which
he invested his son Pierre Loys Farneze, and in the end obtained the
Emperors consent (for that in time past they had appertained to the Duchy of
Milan:) Upon condition of some recompense, and the marriage of his natural
daughter with Octauian, eldest son to Pierre Louys. Who imagining to assure
the insolences of his frail and arrogant life, thorough the rigorous carriage
of himself, and his strong fortresses which he there built, especially at
Plaisance, was notwithstanding in the end stabbed in with a Dagger, by the
Paluoysins his Subjects and others as he sat at dinner. But shortly after
Ferdinande Gonzague Lieutenant for the Emperor in the Duchy of Milan was
ready to enter, both with horse and foot to sease of Plaisance to the use of
the Emperor, which made men to think that he favored the plat: So the Pope
greatly offended as well at the loss of his son, as of his lands, and
especially by him who had been so greatly benefited, by him and his house, to
which he was himself alied, found no more ready way for the defense of the
rest (knowing that a number of the country about Parma yielded day by day to
Gonzague, and others for the Emperor) then to send Camillo Vrsino, Paul 3.
dies. July 3. chosen Pope.
one of the Captains of the Church to Parma: being himself clean worn with
age, his end the rather hastened by so sorrowful news: And seeing himself
even ready to depart, ordained by his will that Parma should be rendered to his
grand child Octauian, the which was confirmed by Ialie the third, before
Cardinal of Mont-Aretin, chosen Pope after certain defferents which had passed
in the conclaue, commanding Camillo to deliver unto him the City which he
did. Notwithstanding, that the Emperor had earnestly required him to deliver
it into his hands as Protector of the substance of the Church, The means
which Charles the Emperor used to get Parma.
and besides as Lord of Millane, from whence these places had been dismembered,
declaring unto him the great charge of expense convenient for the tuition
thereof; yea proceeding so far as to threaten Camillo if he did not deliver
it. And seeing he could not by these means obtain it, he offered high rewards
to Octauian, who notwithstanding utterly despised them, fearing like sundry
other he should become clean frustrate as well of his certainty, as his hope.
The Pope for all that deeply pressed in the end thorough the soliciting of
the Emperor, signified unto Octauian that he would no longer sustain the
expense which he had promised toward the protection of his dominions.
Whereupon, he being greatly astonished, especially for that the other seemed
clean to forget himself, having received his first advancement from the house
of Farneze, and considering that his father in law endeavored but his spoil, in
the end besought the King of France to receive him under his protection: Who
being persuaded that the action was worthy of commiseration, and that by the
example of his ancestors, he ought to show himself therein ready to succor the
afflicted, and above all things a protector of the goods of the Church: first
comforted him with a hope of succor, and not being able to bring the Pope to
take up the matter otherwise, he undertook the defense thereof upon favorable
conditions, to the Church of Rome: The King of France takes Octauian Farneze
and Parma into his protection.
so as the French entered there very shortly after, which the Emperor took in
very evil part, attributing it to a mere and wilful breach of Peace so
solemnelye concluded. The K. notwithstanding to make manifest his entente
herein, which he foresawe would be evil construed of such as were ignorant of
his meaning, and chiefly to put out of every man's head such reproaches and
backbitinges, as by his enemies might be supposed, that he should have a
further end then he would discover, made known to all men by two several
ways, that banding himself against the Pope and his partakers, he would not
be separate in ought might appertain to the union of the church of Rome: first
by the persecution which he was counseled to sharpen and double against the
Lutheranes, secondly, by his protestations which of his own deliberation he
sent, as well to the counsel of Trent as dietts, of the emperor and other
christian princes: touching the first he presently made a most sure testimony
thereof, to such as cheeflie desired his enmity with the Pope, and banding
against the Chatholick obedience, for upon the complaint which the Clergy made
unto him of the unbridled company of Lutheranes, which increased to a great
eyesore throughout his Realm, he caused a marvelous rigorous Edict to be
made for their searching out, revealing, condemnation and punishment. The which
being made at Chasteau-Briant where then he was, the 27. of June 1551. was
called the Edict of Chasteau-Briant: by virtue whereof all the ancient Edicts
which punished Heretics were revived and made in force; the sovereign
knowledge given to the Presidiaux, to the end to make speedy expedition, and
among sundry other articles for the punishing of Printers, Booke-binders, and
other sellers of suspected books, it was enacted that the Estates of
Judicature thereto ordained, and Regentes of Schools should be bound to bring
proof to witness that they were well reputed of among good Catholic
Christians: that information should be made against the negligence of such
Judges as slacked their punishment from three months to three months, that
the Mercuriales should be in force in sovereign Courts, in which should be
chiefelye handled the points of faith, especially for the purging of such
faults as might be found in any suspected of heresy, whereof he willed
information should be made: the goods of heretics retired to Geneua, to be
confiscate to the King, except good proof were made that they were simply
bought: together with sundry other rigorous articles. Now for that to the end
the estate of France might be the better assured and maintained, the Kings at
all times have been contented to yield this authority to that Parliament of
Paris (being assembled of the most remarqued Frenchmen, for their knowledge,
experience and other virtues, as well Clergy as Layetie) to judge whether the
letters, statutes, Edicts, and ordinances, although they were before resolved
of by the Privy counsel, were fit to be put in practice throughout the
Realm, to the end they should be either received, published, and engrossed of
record in their Court, or sent back again to the King if they were not found
just, reasonable, and aduantagious to the estate: together with their
declarations which they must send both in writing and word of mouth, by some
one of their own body, which to that purpose they dispatch. The Edict was
presently carried to the Kings Counsel (which are his Proctor and 2.
Advocates ordained for his assistance) at the earnest suit of the Clergy,
requiring to have it engrossed of record in the Court, but it was refused for
many considerations, which a number of Counselors alleged, that at that time
stood suspected, and since found to be Lutherans, as hereafter I will
declare. In the end notwithstanding by the earnest and continual instance of
the Cardinals and other of the Clergy about the King, who besides would make
him self appear most Christian throughout all Europe, especially for the
reasons above mentioned, Religion well maintained preserves all estates.
the Court was so pressed, that all the articles of the Edict were there in
public audience read, the 3. of September 1551. in the Chamber called Doree.
Of all which Pierre Seguier the Kings Advocate, demanding the engrossing of
the behalf of the Proctor general, said that it was well known how the
Kings of France had been always zealous protectors of christianity, of the
faith and union of the Church, for which they worthily deserved the name of
most Christian: that there was no doubt but zeal of Religion was one of the
principal causes, for which it pleased God to maintain the estate of that
Realm in that greatness it was until that day, that historyes did witness,
among all the misfortunes and unhappiness which fell out between the Roman
Kings, the reign of Numa Pompilius to have been found most long, happy and
peaceable, because he was most zealous in Religion. And Titus Liuius and
Plutarch write, Quod Numa Primus condidit templum fidei: primus fidei solemn
instituit. And albeit that the Religion of Numa was not ruled after the word
of God, yet having had so great an increase of good fortune in his Heathenishe
Religion, it may very well cause us to think that the care and zeal which
the Kings of France have had for Christian religion, has greatly auailed and
helped toward the maintenance and enlarging of the Monarchy of France.
Contrariwise negligence of Religion, the leaving and apostacy of faith, and
the scismes and divisions in the Church, are the beginning and spring of all
mischiefs, and the forewarning of desolation and ruin to a Commonwealth. The
examples are very common De neglecta Religione, both in Valerius and other our
own Histories, as the Books of Moses do testify, that the children of
Israel, while they held themselves united in the faith of God, and precepts of
Moses, prospered and overcame all adversities, but when they withdrew
themselves from religion, they fell into great ruin. The most Christian King
considering and well understanding these things, has studiously and diligently
searched by all possible means, how the error of the Pseudo-christians might
be extermined, and clean rooted out of this Realm, and to this end has
commanded these letters now read, to be approved in this Court: and further
said that he could not omit to yield due thanks unto the King for his most
gracious, royal, and most Christian will, most humblye beseeching God that it
would please him to preserve the King in this charity, devotion and zeal,
many years, and hereupon concluded, and required the publication and approving
of the letters, enioyning the Prelates and Clergy in what appertained to their
charge, to obey the contents thereof. Then the Presidente after the counselors
had delivered their opinions, gave this sentence. The Court in obeying of the
Kings will, ordains that upon the plight of the said letters shall be set
down, Lecta, publicata and Registrata, audito and requirente procuratore
generale Regis, and that the Judges Presidiaux, and such as assist them in
judgment of criminal enditementes, shall upon sight thereof cause the
prisoners to be brought before them and hear them speak in person, and such
judgments as shall be so given by the Presidiaux and their assistantes, shall
not be held and reputed for sufficiently concluded and awarded, except it
pass the consent of two at the least, according to the ordinance. And gave in
charge to the Court of the said Judges, that after judgment given upon the
said criminal enditements, they should make them safely to be kept by such
Greffiers as the court should appoint, to have diligent care of the same, to
the end they might both deliver and answer the same, whatsoever they should be
called upon. Moreover, he warned and exhorted the Court, the Archbishops, and
Prelates that resorted thereunto, enioyning them to keep and fulfill the
contents of the said letters, in whatsoever might concern them, the 3. of
September 1551. Now let us handle again the imperials practices against the
French: you shall below see in place fitter for it, the second means which the
King had to justify himself for his actions in the occurrence of Parma.

If the Emperor were angry knowing of the Kings resolution in favor of the
Farnezes, Pope Iulye made no less show thereof, Pope Paul seeks to retain
Octauian Farneze.
and thereupon the 11. of April he bitterly accused Octauian by a writing
published to that end. When (said he) he received Parma at my hands, and the
estate of Supreme Governor, he promised me upon his faith that he would
never serve other Prince, nor put any Garrison of Strangers into Parma without
my leave: and as soon as any appearance was of any change, I oftentimes very
lovingly admonished him by men expressly, and by his own brother the Cardinal
Alexander, that he should remember his duty. But because he answered very
strangely, I threatened him by letters under great pains, if he should forget
himself: hoping in time to have won him. But since being advertised how
far he swarueth from the accord, I have great cause to be extreamelye angrye,
that one whom I had enriched and advanced to honor, should offer me such an
iniurye. Now then though it were lawful for me to pronounce judgment in so
apparante and clear a matter, yet to the end to make him know my courtesy, I
charge him to appear at Rome within 30. days, to answer to his accusations,
and to put in good security for his coming: if hereof he make no account, I
condemn and hold him for guilty of treason, disloyalty and other crimes,
willing and meaning that all his goods shall be confiscat: for which I require
aid of the emperor; that he will hold a strong hand to help me to punish the
same, forbidding all in general to yield him any relief or succor. Paul de
Terms with the Pope in the French Kings behalf.


The King of France in the mean time to appease the Pope and his Cardinals,
declared by his Ambassador Paul de Terms of purpose sent unto Rome, that he
was no whit at all to blame for receiving of Octauian into his protection,
considering it a matter proper to the office of Kings to succor the afflicted.
Besides, says he, he sought no particular profit to himself, but all for the
benefit of the Church of Rome, according to the example of his progenitors,
which had enriched the same more than all other, and oftentimes defended it
with the sword: for considering that Parma was of the patrimony of the Church,
he would especially seek to prevent, that it might not fall into the hands of
any stranger, which was the very reason that he was at so great and
ordinary an expense. Therefore he earnestly besought him to take it in good
part, and not to remain in that hard opinion he had conceived of him, a
matter which should bring great profit to the commonwealth. But if refusing
all satisfaction, he preferred war before peace, he might well perceive the
danger which would ensue to the whole Church, and to Europe it self, in that
it was impossible in the mean time to assure or establish any matter of
religion, besides the trouble which would fall out among Christians, the
Council summoned could not assemble, or if it did, it must of necessity be
dissolved, for that as the case stood he should not be able to send any
of his Bishops to the Council of Trent. Above all things no fault could be
laid upon him, who not only desired the conditions of peace, but also was
ready to embrace them, the which he publicly protested. But July relying
upon the Emperors promises, would never a whit relent for this: but having
condemned the Duke Octauian, as a rebellious vassal of the church, gave leave
to the Emperor to recover Parma in what sort he could. Wherefore Fernande
Gonzague assembling with all speed the garrisons of Millaine and Piemont, and
besides joined with the troops which John Baptista lead under the Apostolic
title and authority, began to brave it in the country about Parma, and in the
end besieged Parma and Mirandolle, which the French said were adjudged by Paul
the fourth, to be held under the protection of King Henry and his
successors, who shortly after sent thither Horace Farneze, brother to Octauian,
with De Terms, D' Andelot, Cypierre, and sundry other: commanding Brissac,
his lieutenant in Piemont, to put as many as he was able into the field, to
make Fernande raise his siege, and to annoie him as much as in him lay. Which
he so readily performed, that he took Quiers, Saint Damian, and other places
of the Marquisate of Mont-ferrat, ready to have reached further, if Gonzague
had not well bestirred himself to hinder his enterie into the Duchy of
Millaine. Behold then these Princes which with the fire of their miserable
Country begin to feel, or at least to foresee the ruin of their poor
subjects.

Now as they might well think, that many would easily know and at leisure
judge, that this fire of eternal ambition had soon made them forget the
covenants and promises of so general a peace, of the year 1546. so did every
of them, as well by their writings, as Ambassadors into all parts, seek to
lay the fault and first motion of breach of peace upon his enemy. The king of
France to this end, and by the self same hand to be meet with such rumors as
his enemies might cause to be given out of him, contrary to his own meaning,
sent the Abbot of Bellozane to the council of Trent, where sundry Princes and
Prelates were assembled by the Emperor and Pope July, as well for the matter
of religion, as affairs of the Empire, and other particulars, the Cardinal
Crescence there as chief in the name of the Pope. The Emperor had sent
thither Frances of Toledo, The French king terms the Counsel of Trent but
an assembly.
Hugues Earl of Mont-fort, and Guilliaume of Poictiers: and for that the
Council day fell on the first of September, the Abbot presented him self
there with his Letters addressed to the assembly. After that he had delivered
them to the Popes Legate, and that the superscription was read, they consulted
together, why he rather termed it an assembly than a council: some being of
opinion that they ought not at all to have been received, except the
Ambassador showed his warrant for the same. Thereupon arose a great tumult,
with a long houting, which chiefly proceeded from the Spanish Bishops. But
when the Ambassador answered that his commission was contained in the Letters,
the Popes Legate rose up, and calling the fathers into the priuatest place of
the Temple, debated of the matter, where it was agreed that he should be
heard, considering that the superscription might be as well construed in good
part. After then that the Letters had been read in private, by which the King
declared in brief the wrong which was done him, and the displeasure which
thereof he conceived, requiring credit to be given to whatsoever his
Ambassador should deliver, they fate all down again. And after that the
Letters were there publicly rehearsed, they answered, that they could not take
in evil part, the King tearming of the Council an Assembly, not willing to
mistrust any evil, by so great a King, surnamed Most Christian: that if he
should have any other intention or meaning, in that case they held them as not
written, and so commanded him to deliver what he had in charge. Then he began
his Oration, which was long, The French Ambassadors oration in the Council of
Trent.
wherein the King recited all that had passed between the Pope and the Senate
of Cardinals, by his Ambassador Paul de Terms, and that by no means he could
do any good, albeit he had done as much as in him lay for peace. But that
Pope July, who by the example of his ancestors ought, if not clean to appease,
yet at the least to mittigate the debates and contentions of Princes, had
contrariwise lighted a great fire in a most unseasonable time: to wit, when the
state of Christendom was maruellously weakened, and since it is so, that he
carries so bitter and eager a heart against him which is the eldest son of
the Church, he protested, as before he had done at Rome. First, that for the
great affairs and inconveniences whereof his hands were full, it was neither
lawful nor convenient that any Bishops of his realm should be suffered to
go to Trent. Besides, that he does not hold it for a public and general
council, but rather for a private congregation made to serve some men's
particular profit and commodity, and not for a commonwealth. And that
touching any Decree which they should there make, neither he nor any of his
realm could be liable, or should be bound thereto: and farther, that if the
matter so required, he would serve himself with such remedies as his
ancestors were accustomed to do in like cases. True it is, that he would
always carry a pure heart, bear a good affection to religion, and the church
of Rome, and keep himself from doing ought worthy of reprehension. But
for so much as he found himself highly grieved at the injuries and hatreds of
some, which he never deserved, he could do no otherwise for the present time,
and that they should take this his protestation in good part, and make him an
act whereby he might inform all other Princes and christians of all that had
been passed. The Kings Letters being read, the fathers said that they would
answer him in the first Session, provided that the King should acknowledge it
for a council which was held at Trent, as touching that which then passed, they
received it as far forth as the law would permit. Wherefore they could not
deliver unto him any act or testimony whatsoever.

Whereas the King said, that he would use the remedy his ancestors were wont
to practice, it grew thus. In France as well as other countries, The choice of
Bishops and Clergy denied to the Pope.
if any Bishopric or Abbey became void, those whom they termed Chanons or
Monks had liberty to choose: the other Benefices which were not elective,
were bestowed by the Bishops and Patrones, and all suites for matter of
Benefices were determined each one in his own province. But the Popes by
little and little began clean to alter these elections, and to draw for
themselves all the profit to Rome, by reseruations and expectatiue graces, and
caused all suites to be brought thither, even at the first instance. This
change began in France in the time of Jews the ninth, who notwithstanding
stoutly resisted it, by the advice of his Council and Parliament, and made an
ordinance in the year: 1267. by which he commanded the ancient custom should
be maintained, and for all that no man to pay ought to the Pope, which law
stood in force many years after. But the authority of the Popes became in
the end mistress, scattering among the Clergy throughout Christendom their
graces and reseruations, which were most chargeable and odious unto every man,
until the Council of Basle utterly abolished this manner of taking, relying
upon the ancient laws of collations and elections, and forbidding the exaction
of Auates. So as Charles the seventh after that he had summoned a Council of
the choicest men of all his realm, approved that Decree of the Council, The
enacting of La Pragmatique Sanction
and in the year 1438. confirmed it by an Edict, which was commonly called La
Pragmatique Sanction. Yet afterward Eugene the fourth pronounced this council
of no valor, so as the Popes which since succeeded, have utterly refused this
Decree, and named it Schismatic. Yea Pope Pius the second, sent his
Ambassador to Jews the eleventh son of Charles the seventh, by whom he
tooth and nail insisted to make La Pragmatique Sanction to be abolished. But
the king took council of the Parliment of Paris, which is the most renowned
of all France, composed of learned personages, and experienced in the Civil
and Canon law, and in matters of estate, or other public charge. Who fetching
many things from the antiquity and ordinances of the very Popes themselves,
and Councels in time passed, alleging likewise what his progenitors
Clodo^^^, Charlemagne, Philippe Dicudonne, Jews the ninth, Philip le Bell,
Jews Hat^^, John the first, and finally what his own grandfather had ordained
therein. And taking occasion thereby to show how exceedingly France then
flourished, and how in present she was desolate and weakened, delivered unto
him boldly, that if the ancient laws should not remain in force, all order of
the Clergy would come to utter confusion, and that France would be in the
end left clean uninhabited, by reason many retired themselves to Rome, by
little and little sucking out the whole treasure of the realm, whence would
ensue that the Churches and such like buildings would in the end be utterly
ruined throughout the whole realm. As concerning the treasure, said they, if
the law of your Father take not place, there will yearly be transported to
Rome a million of gold. For, omitting the rest in the time of Pope Pius, at
the least twenty Bishoprics were void, whereof every one paid as well for
the Anates, as other charges, six thousand crowns: about three score Abbeyes,
whereof every one paid two thousand, and above two hundred other Benefices,
of which every one paid above one thousand crowns. Besides, that there is in
your realm more than an hundred thousand parishes, from which a mass of money
is drawn by this invention of the Popes. Follow then your Fathers traces, and
stick fast to the Decree of Basle. Such was the counsel which the Parliament
gave him. But the King overcome with the authority or subtlety of the Pope,
ordained the abolishing of La Pragmatique Sanction, by means of the Cardinal
Balne, one very familyar about the King, and deeply bound to the Pope.
Notwithstanding the Kings Proctor general, and the University of Paris, which
had a great interest therein, courageously withstood it, and appealed from the
Pope to a Council. Jews the twelfth was at great odds with July the second
about the same, and it was referred to the Council of Latran. But Frances the
first agreed thereunto, upon certain conditions with Leo the tenth, in the
City of Bologne la Grass, after that he had gained all Lombardie. To wit,
that a Bishopric or Abbey becoming void, the Chapter should not have power
to choose, but that it should appertain to the King, to name some one within
six months to the Pope, which he thought meet for such a charge. This was the
matter which the King meant, when he spoke of a remedy by his Ambassador: for
this was the reign wherewith the Kings ever brideled the Popes, and when they
fall a quarrelling with them, they press to have La Pragmatique Sanction
revived, cheefely in this time in which Popes commandments are not so much
reverenced as heretofore they have been: and in respect that France is large
and rich, Rome cannot well miss the money without great loss. Now the King
since performed in deed, what he threatened here to Pope Iulye, as we will
handle hereafter. Philip le Bell King of France, used the same remedy against
Boniface the eight, for because that he had charged him to pass the Seas, and
to make war against the Sarrazins, not taking in good part his excuses, he
forbad him to levy any monye upon the Churches, (which the King of necessity
was constrained to do) and if he would not obey, excommunicated him. The King
sent for all his Lords and estates of his Realm to Paris, where after having
discoursed of the outrage of Boniface, and that all the Bishops, Princes, and
Gentlemen confessed that they held all their substance merely of his grace,
bounty, and liberality, he forbad that any money after should be transported to
Rome, and to that end caused a diligent watch to be kept in all the entries and
passages. The sum which was found in the account of the Parliament of Paris,
of that which the Bishoppricks and Abbeys being void did pay, must be
understood of the time passed, for at this present the Taxes are augmented,
and pass the annual revenues, so as some of the Clergy have been feign to
leave their Bulls in the banquers hands for the ouer-great exaction. Now there
are in France twelve archbishoppricks, Aix, Vienne, Lions, Narbonne, Tholouze,
Bourdeaux, Aux, 12. Articles in France.
Bourges, Tours, Rouen, Reims, and Sens: there are about 96. Bishoppricks, by
the vacaties of which is carried to Rome a mass of monye, and of the
Archbishopprickes about threescore thousand, three hundred crowns, as it is
apparent by an account made in the time of King Lewis the twelfth.

Hereupon the King of France not content with the rigorous pursuites he
renewed against the Lutheranes, The K. letters and complaints against the Pope.
to the end that notwithstanding the war he was resolved of against the
Pope, he might entertain the Catholic Princes in good opinion of his faith
and Catholic religion, would make further show of his duty, and just
occasions of war, by a writing sent unto the Pope, of whose deep disgrace
he stood well assured: declaring therein what iniurye was done him. The
cause of the war of Parma, and why receiving of Octauian into his protection,
he forbad under great penalty any money to be transported to Rome: for
considering that monye was the very sinew of war, what follye were it said
he to nourishe a man's enemy with his own wealth? The property of Popes was
to pacify quarrelles among Kings, which Pope Paul the third did, who
altogether creeping with age, came as far as Nice into the Country of Genes,
to reconcile his late Father to the emperor. But Iulye ran a clean contrary
course, for having no sooner published the counsel most necessary for the
commonwealth, he presently moved a war, whereby the French Church one of
the most principal of Christendom, was clean excluded: requiring a lawful
counsel might be summoned, to amend as well the faults of the Prelates and other
Ministers of the Church, as a number of other things being there handled, to
correct the vices of every one. This was publyshed at Paris by sound of Trumpet
the seventh of September: anon after he had proclaimed the Edict of
Chasteau-Briant against the Lutheranes. Shortly after, the Imperials caused the
clean contrary to be given out and proclaimed, in which the beginning of the
war of Parma was specified, where having showed how great reason the Pope had
to be angry with Octauian and the Lord of Mirandolle, how contrary the King of
France was bent, that sought all occasions and wrought all means to hinder
the most honest enterprises of the Emperor, gave notwithstanding to wit, that
Charles of Austria who held his practices for little worth, would most
courageously and stoutly pursue the end thereof. And whereas Octauian gave
out, that he was constrained by necessity to put himself under the safegarde
and protection of the King of France, by reason of the outrages and pranckes
of Ferdinand Gonzague, it was clean refuted, for had there been any occasion
of fear (quoth the Emperor) he was the motyfe, who had often sought means to
cause him to be killed: it was after declared how Plaisance was rendered up to
the emperor, by reason that Pierre Louis the Popes Bastard, enjoying Parma and
Plaisance, behaved himself so cruelly in his government, that he drew the
wrath of God upon him, and every man's hatred: by the example of Nero,
especially for his execrable wickedness, not only with women, but very men:
wherefore he was most justly murdered in his own house by the Citizens,
which could not endure his cruelty any longer. This done, the inhabitants
forseeing their apparent and imminent danger, if they should fall again into
the subjection of the Pope and Church of Rome, could find no other refuge or
more assured liberty, then to render themselves to the Emperor: namely,
having been at other times vassailes of the empire: they solicited then
Gonzague and prayed him to receive the^ into the Emperors protection,
otherwise they would think of some other succor and defense: it is but
counterfeit then in making semblance of fear, for the Emperor never gave him
occasion, as one that had greatly benefited the Farnezes, having chosen
Octauian for his son in law, and given the City of Nouarre for ever to his
father Louis, and bestowed on him the honor of Marquess: but both of them
oftentimes showed themselves maruelouslye ungrateful, and especially when they
made show of ayding him against certain rebels of Germany, for in the mean
time they endeavored to take from him both Lombardie, and Gennes it self: for
proof whereof Ioannin Dorie a virtuous man, if ever were any was most
villanously murdered in the tumulte, while he faithfully employed himself for
the Emperor, and sought to deliver the Country from that danger into which
he saw it most ready to fall: The K. answer to the Emperors objection.
there was shortly after an answer put in print under the name of the King of
France, in which was rehearsed how the Emperor desiring to win unto him
Paul the third, had bestowed upon his son Pierre Louis, the title and
dignity of Marquess, had taken Octauian son to Pierre for his son in law,
yielding goodly benefits to Alexander his other son, besides which he had
made an alliance with the Pope, wherein was especially set down, that the
Emperor should confirm the decree of the consistory of Cardinals, namely,
that the Emperor should confirm the principallitie of Parma and Plaisance to
the familye of Farnezes. Now whereas the Emperor made war in Germany,
punishing some private rebellions under pretense of setting up of religion:
this slight meruailously displeased the Pope, considering by this means he
showed well enough that he had no regard but to his particular profit, and
making of himself great. And in truth said the King, the Pope was no whit
therein misconceiued, for as soon as the war was finished, and the Emperor
no more in need of the Fernezes aid, he publicly declared his evil meaning
conceived against the Pope: for his Liuetenants of Italy had already found
means to compass Plaisance, and anon after murderers were hired to kill
Pierre Louis in his chamber: and before that ever the Citizens had notice of
the murder, men of war were sent in to seize of the Castle in the name of
the Emperor, who if he had been so ignorant of the fact, it had been great
reason that after the death of Pope Paul, he should have sought the delivery of
the City to the Church of Rome: but so far was he from it, as he went about
to take Parma out of the hands of his own Nephewe, yea while Pope Paul lived,
he made pursuit thereof, in such sort that Paul taking a conceit thereat
died for grief. Afterward Ruffians were found at Parma, which of their own
accord confessed that Fernande Gonzague had given them in charge to murder
Octauian. He then perceiving himself in this distress, that such as ought to
have preserved him, yea his own father in law, sought to take from him not only
his substance but his life, demanded succor of the King, and yielded himself
into his hands, which he could not by any means gainsay, pressed thereunto
by so many tears and reasons. The case standing thus, and for these occasions
all the Princes being animated, every one bestirred him to do the worste he
could against his enemy. Captain Powlin having in readiness his galleys and
fleet at Marseilles, furnished and victuailed for Scotland, took certain
Merchants Ships of Flaunders, upon the English Sea, the which he rifled,
alleging that under color of traffic, they transported the victuail and
munition of the Realm, to make themselves the better able to prevail against
France. Elsewhere the Governors of the frontires prepared themselves openly
to the war: the Queen of Hungary in like sort being gouernesse for her
Brother in the Low country, made stay of all Frenchmen and their goods, near
at the same time, that the emperor discharging of Marillac Ambassador for the
King about his person, with many hard and angrye speeches against his Master,
had resolved to pass an army into France, to be revenged of the wrong which
he faide he had sustained. And because it was doubted that he would enter by
Champagne, where Bourdillon was with certain Troops, the Duke of Neuers was
sent thither with 10. companies of men at arms, which he distributed for the
better strengthening of the weaker Garrisons, providing as well as he could for
the fortifications and munitions of those places, where he bestowed the eight
old bands which the King had sent unto him: while it was thus in working,
they put out into the field, to be the better able to put in execution some
soddaine surprisales, according to their old intelligences, whereof very few
took good effect. Then each party tarrying for the maine of his army, made
many little skirmishes, now with good, and now with bad fortune, as well on the
one side as the other. In the mean time happened the defeat of a number of
Bourgonians, which the company of Gasper de Coligny called Chastillon, defeated
near unto Montcornet in Ardennes: leaving five hundred dead on the place, for
recompense whereof, other making a show but of a small company of
Harquebusiers, presenting themselves near unto Mauber-Fontaine, charged and
killed in an ambuscade, the Captain Gourdes, accompanied with five and twentye
old soldiers, too ventrous and ill advised, in not tarrying for Bourdillon
and his people, who being arrived after their death, followed the Bourgonians,
already retired safe by the benefit of the wood, into which for want of
Harquebusiers, they could not hinder more then two parts of them that had the
victory, to retreat in surety: as Mazaeres stood in great want of provisions,
join thereto that a Soldier loves best to get from the enemy, and keep his
own for his necessity: Captain Villefranche having in the night planted a
number of matches fiered, upon the top of the Castle Ditches at Lumes, while
that the Imperials discharged at them both Harquebusies, Culuerins, and other
shot, took all the cattle and other provisions which the inhabitants kept
by favor of the Ports: out of which, some of the most courageous having
sallyed by little, saw themselves so bepelted with Harquebusies, that they were
constrained to let their provisions be carried to Maizieres. But the Burgonians
having surprised the Castle of Aspremont, which the young Earl yielded up to
the Duke of Neuers, and in a course killed Captain Ligneres, and defeated the
greatest part of his company between Hedin and Monstreuilse, greatly bragged
that they had been so well revenged. At the same time the Garrisons of
Pickardie under the Duke of Vendosme, and his brothers the Duke of Anguien and
Prince of Conde, were no less often and painefully awakened, then those of
Champaigne all the long winter, in which their masters notwithstanding were
busied about more high enterprises the^ those before mentioned, as I will make
you well to perceive.

Behold these Princes hard at it, and the original and preparation of their
quarrels: whereupon I think good before that I pass any further to fetch the
affairs of the Christians from more high, to the end I may not give any
occasion that should turn you from the knowledge of that which I will entreat
of: for as I speak of war, of Religion, policy and other humane actions, when
you shall see the Counsel of Trent mentioned, and not know to what end, when,
nor by whom it was held: the Lutheranes and obstinate pursued with fire and
blood, of the time whereof you should be ignorant, and of the places where they
came into the world, by whom, and in what doctrine they stood instructed: if
I speak of the Protestants banded, against so great Potentates, and you not
know whence they descended, nor why their Father was so named, nor the variable
success of their enterprises, nor how, nor why they were succored by the
Kings of France, England, and other Princes, with a number of things which
would remain unknown unto you, for that you could not understand their
beginning and progress, you would take very small delight therein: at the
least you will take double contentment, if all the whole be made manifest and
plain, as you would your self desire: since then that the knowledge of
natural things content not the spirit, if the cause and reason thereof rest
unknown amidst many accidents, a somewhat less agreeable discourse, by reason
of the ignorance of their original, shall satisfy the more curious sort, if
in representing therein unto you their very spring and true motife, I shall not
fetch it from over far.

which may easily be seen in all vocations, especially in the doctrine which
all embrace to the conduct of their salvation. For to hold my peace of the
diversity which is among the Christians, half Christians, Mahometists, Jews
Paganes and other, yea of the multitude of different and contrary opinions,
which is in every one of them, it has been ever seen, that Christendom how
general soever it has at any time been, was always set at controversy by
some particular judgment: now in matter of substance, now in discipline, now
in ceremonies and outward apparances, be it that it proceed of ignorance or of
a good zeal, of malice or some indiscretion of persons, which advance
themselves to speak. And if we shall seek further examples then the memory of
our fathers, it is most certain that religion planted in France in the time
of the Pagans, grown under the line of Clouis, was no sooner established under
Pepin and his successors, but the authority and consequently abuse of certain
of the Clergy, increasing with the abundance of wealth, the zeal and
curiosity of such as would reform the discipline and life of the officers,
encouraged men by little and little to attempt to the substance, and some to
band themselves secretly and by writings, others with open mouth, against the
Articles of doctrine, which they little judged of, less understood, or worse
practiced. As notwithstanding the Pastors confirming their general received
doctrine, by a better life then ours, authorized both by one and the other
thorough a severe punishment of justice, to the example of every one; so the
reformation being hindered to grow by the diligence and study of the Bishops
and iusticers, it could not spread so far but that at this day, (when all
estates are only curious of their pleasure and particular profit) they have
themselves given entry to what they most complained off and least doubted. So
many held their peace, and the hardest could not gain so much, as to make any
other opinion run among the people then the common, until that the officers
of the Church and justice, surprised in their duty, by such as spied but an
occasion fit to give entry unto their opinions, saw themselves sooner beaten
then assailed, by those whose very first March they always before despised.
How the doctrine of the Vaudois and Albigeois was dispersed thorough Europe
Then after many and light brunts with the common faith received in France,
(since the sure and public establishmentes of Christian Religion) by Berenger
of Tours, Abeyllard Breton, Amaury of Chartres, Arnold of Bresse, and other,
followed by a great number of Sectaries as well in this Realm as else where,
it never was so earnestly assaulted as by the Vaudoios and their successors in
Guienne and Countries about, which they named Albigeois of the town of Alby
chief of Albigeois, situate between Languedos and Quercy. Who in spite of
all the Potentates of Christendom sowed about the year 1100. and even since
their doctrine smally differing from the Protestants at this day: Not only
through France, but almost all the Countries of Europe. For the French,
Spanish, English, Scots, Italians, Germans, Bohemians, Saxons, Polonians,
Lithuaniens and other people have mightily defended it until this present.
After that this doctrine had a while crept thorough France, in the end as the
heat of burning coals does exhalate and pearce thorough by little and little,
the thickness of the Sinders not able to quench it, it grew more commonly
known, by Prayers, public exhortations, administrations of Sacraments and
other uses, the course whereof the Clergy not being able to hinder, sought
under the authority of the Pope, aid and force at the hands of Christian
Princes, Opinions sooner changed by ease and rest then violence
whom they speedely armed against the Albigeois. Whom after a number of
assaults, battles, reencounters, losses, ruins, victories and reciprocal
advantages, from the year 1200. For 50. years after ever maintaining by arms
and force the outward show of their lives, their doctrine and their Country
together; until that the chief of them were defeated and empouerished, other
gained by fair protestations and promises of better hap, and all in general
together weary with the continuance of so long Civil wars: The Christian
Princes and Prelates of the Church left (as in contempt) a wandering people of
all parts terrified with so cruel a war, insisting in their first opinion,
which rather the ease of the rest they after felt caused them to change, then
any rigor of their enemies. So as all the French anon! after returned to the
same doctrine, from which their fathers had so much swarued, except such as
retired themselves into the mountains, chiefly the Prouencaux, Sauoyarts,
Dauphinois, and Piemontois: of whom there were many sent into Lombardie,
Calabria, Pouille, Sicille, German and other places, to the end they might
plant the fruit of that doctrine which they stood assured was the most true
and ancient of Christendom. Now the English was Lord of Guienne in the time
of these Albigeois wars, by reason that Henry of Aniou after the death of
Stephen became king of England, Duke of Normandy, Earl of Aniou Tourraine and
Maine. The English Lords of Guienne in france Normandy, Poictou, Anioy, etc.
And afterward grew to be Earl of Poictou and Duke of Aquitaine (called
Guienne) by virtue of Eleonor his wife daughter to Guillame, last Earl of
Poictou, whom king Louys le Ieune had diuourced. So as sundry English men,
which ordinarily came into those countries, either by reasons of trafique and
merchandise, or war against the French, had speedely enough being imbrued
with the same opinions, spread them abroad in their own Country. Which having
been conceived and explaned by many, in the end fell from hand to hand into
the head of Wicklife, about 50. years after, a greatly renowned Divine in the
University of Oxford, and Curate of Luteruorth in the Diocese of Lincoln.
Who in the end being a Doctor in Divinity thorough his eloquence and rare
Doctrine, gained so far the hearts and understandings of the English, The
Religion of the Vaudois dispersed thorough England.
and chiefly of the greatest sort, as the Duke of Lancaster uncle to king
Richard, Henry of Persye, Jews Clifford, the Chaunlor Kegli, the Earl of
Sarisburie and others, as a long time after he preached, wrought and dispersed
with all liberty what best seemed good unto him. Most chiefly under King
Edward. True it is that Pope Alexander thorough the sollicitings of the chief
of the Clergy, VVicklife his Doctrine.
animated Richard his successor, much against him in the year 1382: Who
prevailed so far, that after sundry disputations of the Articles of his
faith, he was banished, afterward called home, and dyed. 1387. But 40. years
after his decease, his body was pulled out of the ground by the Popes
commandment, and his bones burned at Oxford 1410. before the Abbot of
Shrewsberie then Chancellor. And albeit that 13. years after his death, 1401.
his doctrine was utterly condemned in open Parliament, with an Iniunction to
all men to seek out those Lollards, (so called they such as professed that
order of doctrine, Lollards in England, Liuonia Sermatia, etc.
according unto those of Pologne, and borderers unto it) yet for all that,
could it not hinder the multiplying thereof as well in that Country as else
where. Chiefly in Germany, by reason of the great learning which was taught
by the famous Fathers of the University of Oxford: Where among other, How the
doctrine of the Vaudois and Wicklife was carried into Polonia, Bohemia, and
other countries of Almaine.
a Scholar of Bohemia, being much delighted in a book of Wicklifes called The
Vniversals, carried a Coppie thereof with him into his Country, where the
University of Prague was of great commendations. In which John Hus more
renowned then the rest for his quicknes of spirit, made himself for all that
much better known after the reading of those books: which he explaned and so
much thereby increased the doctrine which long since was spread abroad in those
quarters, that many of the people, Scholars, and of the very Nobles and Clergy
themselves, followed the same as a matter worthy to be received among men. Now
among the rest of the people which for their conscience were persecuted, the
Bohemians had been long before John Hus, The Bohemians and Almaines persecuted
by the Popes inquisitors before John Hus.
by Venceslaus King of Bohemia, who made great search after them and roundly
punished them. And by the Pope, who long before that, had sent thither an
inquisitor of the ill affected of the faith, who ( John Hus living) was named
Bishop of Nazaret. Be it then that the persecutions either coolled this kind
of people thorough out Christendom, or that the Princes and Clergy made no
accounte of those, who standing favored by no great personages became all
simple people and inhabitants of the Montaignes, as those of Piemont, Sauoye,
Calabria, and other, the Bohemians stood at that instant most renowned and
worst meant to. Especially after that Hus had reformed his preaching, leassons
and writings by the tradition of Wicklife. So as in the year, 1414. the
Counsel being summoned at Constance, for the controversy of the Popes, and
reformation of the Clergy, John Hus a Bachelor in Divinity, to the end to
purge himself of the heresy which was laid to his charge, was cited thither
by the Pope, and after having refused to come, accounting it no safe or sure
place, he was persuaded by Sigismond the Emperor that they might safely go
thither and return again, at the request of his brother Venceslaus King of
the Country: and besides that Venceslaus of Dube, and John De Chlum Gentlemen
of Pologne, should accompany him. But so far was he from being suffered to
present himself to the assembly of the Council, to render accounte of his
faith as the Emperor and his brother would have had it, that the Cardinals
clapped him up close prisoner: Council of Constance summoned for the refomation
of the Church.
and clean contrary to the earnest requests, which not only many Gentlemen
of Bohemia, but the very University of Prague made, that he might not be
condemned before he were publicly hard. But in the end the Emperor being
persuaded, that there could be no defense, safe conduct or other means
yielded to him, which had been already condemned as an heretic, and
especially a Protestant, public professed, and that he ought rather to prepare
wood and fire to consume him into ashes, John Hus, condemned, and burnt as an
heretic at Constance, notwithstanding the Emperors safe conduct.
if he would not decline from his obstinacy, the seventh of July presiding
amidst all the Princes and Prelates with his imperial robes in the great temple
of Constance, after certain Articles there drawn out of his writings as
heretical, one of the deputies which examined him, pronounced that the
Council declared him for an heretic, a Disciple and favorer of Wicklife,
whose books had been already burnt by a Council at Rome, that he was wilful
in his heresies, for the appeal which he had cast in from the Council to
Jesus, reproving his appellation as scandalous and injurious to the Popes
authority and Ecclesiastical jurisdiction: and therefore he was to be
disgraded of his Priestly order, with all infamy and reproach, afterward the
Bishops attired him in a profane garment and estate, and gave him a crown of
Paper one cubite high, painted with three black and ougly Devils, having for
devise Heresiarcha as one should say the chief and Prince of heretics.
This done the Emperor into whose hands the Clergy had put him, as the
secular arm, commanded D. Louis of Bauiere, kneeling before him with his
ornament in his hand an Apple of Gold and the figure of the Cross) to deliver
him to the hangman, who having burned his books, and tied him fast with an
iron cheane to a stake, piled up with wood and straw to his chinne, soon
consumed him to ashes, which they flong into the Rhine, to the end no more
memory should remain of him. Hereupon the Princes for to remedy all abuses,
and replante the Church in her first glory, deposed Pope John 24. of that
name, as a Simonous heretic, and man-slaier, who fled disguised to Scafusen,
and from thence to Fribourg in Brisgoe: But being taken in the fifth year of
his Pontificate, was three years kept prisoner. Gregory who likewise had held
him self for Pope, Popes deposed.
dismissed himself of the popedom. And Pierre de la Lune named Pope Benoist,
was condemned for sundry offenses. John Gerson Chauncelor of the University
of Paris (which had sent him with others to Constance) said that never there
would be any Peace in the Church until the Moon were taken away. Martin
the fifth of that name before called Ame de Sauoie, was chosen and approved of
all.

Hierosme of Prague companion to John Hus, understanding of his entertainment,
departed out of Bohemia, and the 4. of April 1415. arrived near Constance to
comfort him, and offered to answer all such injuries in open council as were
given out of them of Bohemia, if they would give him any safe conduct: Jerome
of Prag condemned and burned at Constance as John Hus.
which being refused by the Emperor, he contented himself in obtaining of the
Lords and Protector of Bohemia, their letters sealed with their seals,
witnessing his innocence, and that he was come to answer such reproaches as
his adversaries had given out: but as he thought to have returned, he was
taken and carried to Constance, where he was so straightly used and examined,
that in the end he publicly rehearsed a form of abiuration, which they
delivered unto him, confessing further that John Hus was lawfully punished. But
as they let him go never a whit the sooner for that, and thereuppon certain
Carmos of Bohemia being come with new accusations, he recanted and stuck so
fast to his first opinion, that the council condemned him as before they did
John Hus, whence he appealed unto Jesus Christ: so that (said he) after one
hundred years you shall make account for me: but the hangmen did as much for
him as the other. Poge Florentin being present at all, greatly commended in a
wrighting which he sent unto Leonard Aretin, the eloquence, grace, knowledge,
and marvelous constancy of Hierosme: thinking nothing wanting in him but a
conformity of the common faith. Now when these news were carried into
Bohemia, such Gentlemen and other as had been instructed in this doctrine,
growing marvelous angrye, sent their letters to the Princes and Prelates of
Constance, The Bohemians angrye, grow more resolute by the death of Hus and
Hierom.
to testify their conceived displeasure, and their resolution to persist in
the same opinion even to the death and cost of the most mischievous, four and
fifty of the best calling signed and sealed it with their seals. And indeed
as rigours only do not cause men to change opinion, but oftentimes make them
more wilfully to persist therein: the Hussite Bohemians multiplying more and
more, besought of their King Venceslaus many Temples, in which they might
exercise and advance their doctrine, being such a number of people as hourly
were gained, Captain Zischa leuieth men against the Priests and Monks of
Bohemia.
among the rest John Zischa of Trosnouie, one of the most renowned warriers
that followed the King, and which had lost one of his eyes in the former
factions, levied a number of men to the ruin of as many Priests and Monks as
they found to have been authors of the matter of Constance: and so began to
pull down Temples, bruise the Images, throw down the Monasteries, and pull out
the Monks, whom they named Swine fatted in their Cloister: finally in small
time were assembled more then forty thousand men, maintaining the doctrine of
John Hus. In the mean while Sigismond the Emperor, and true heir to the
kingdom of Bohemia by the decease of his Brother, going thither to take
possession, found all passages shut by the people, who extremely hated him for
breach of his faith: so as after many a good and badde reencounter on the one
side and the other, he lost his other eye likewise at the siege of Rabi, and
yet ceased not for all that to conducte and govern his army, yea oftentimes
breaking the troops of Sigismonde, composed of Hungarians, Bohemians, Moraues,
Almanes and Danes: for Eric King of Denmark was come thither to succor him,
with Pierre Infant of Portugal; in sort that the Emperor perceiving that he
could not otherwise remedy it, gained him by fair promises of granting unto
him what charge soever he would require. But Zischa as he was going to the
Emperor dyed of the Plague, and being asked in his sickness where he would
be buried, answered that he would have them flea his body after his death, and
with his skin head a Drum, at the sound whereof he doubted not but all
his enemies would soon betake them to their heels.

From this time forwards the persecutions continued in the church, almost
throughout all Christendom, Luther and his beginning 1518.
at the pursuit of the Inquisitors who were annimated enough against the ill
affected in the faith, but more again some particular and simple people then
persons of mark, until the coming of Luther, which then they the more
augmented as they saw men's faith, belief and charity, to diminish toward men
of the Church: so as the Christian faith being received and oppugned almost in
euerlye country, though in some one less sharply then other (where great
ones countenanced them out, by credit, force of arms, and other means) you may
not find it strange if the religion less common and more secret, seeking in
all times and places but occasion and means fit to lift up and spread it
self abroad, knew well how to take her time in the end 1518. to make her
self known by the negligence of the German Prelates, and the diligence and
hardines of Luther, who reviving of these old opinions, and adding thereunto
what before but by the ignorance of the simple people he thought omitted,
afterward explaining the same by a well ordered delivery, and expressing it in
his Sermons and wrightings, through his eloquence and doctrine, discovered unto
us such a kind of reformation, as has engendered more strange effects then
ever any man could see, read, or understand to have been practiced in any other
place. Now for that the particulars are very memorable and worthy to be left to
the posterity, I am contented to fetch the narration thereof, from the first
original, to the end I would not leave any thing unto you, which might stay
you from the entire knowledge of so notable accidents, as upon this occasion
made all christendom both admire and stand wonderfully astonished.

The pardons which Pope Leo published throughout the world, 1517. to get money,
and provide for a war pretended against the Turk, General pardons published
through Christendom 1517.
were an occasion together with the abuses his Treasorers offered in the leuying
thereof, (as the most learned and notable writers as well of Germany as Italy
has left) that Luther first declared himself an enemy to the ouercharging of
consciences, then a Censor of Popes and ecclesiastical abuses, to reform in
the end the more received doctrine in the Christian Church, for first he found
himself agreeued at the pardons, next banded himself against the insolences
of Receivers, and having put in question the autoritye of the Pope, which
defended them, he came by little and little clean to contemn the doctrine of
the Church of Rome: next to reform it, and in the end utterly to reiecte it.
Now as Leo (say they) used too licentiously the authority of the Romish Sea,
chiefly in such graces as the Court gave of spiritual and beneficial matters,
by the council of Laurens Puccy Cardinal of the title of 4. Sains, so he
scattered throughout, without distinction of time or place, his general
pardons of pleanary remission, as well for the quick as the dead: and delivered
souls out of the pains of Purgatory. And because such favors were delivered
so there were money, and that the Treasurers bought their offices at the Popes
hands, and that little which did come unto his hands was spent badly enough in
other affairs, that he saw many of his Ministers sell for small price, yea
play away at Tauernes, power to deliver souls out of Purgatory, and that the
Pope (who by the meekenes of his own nature, exercised in many things his
pontifical office with little enough Majesty) had at one blow given unto his
sister Magdelaine the profit of such Indulgences as might be reaped in sundry
Countries of Germany, who deputed for her the Bishop Arebaut, that executed his
charge but with too much covetousness and extortion: and that Leo had permitted
the King of France, to use the last payments of his own Realm as should
please him until the war against the Turk; all saving 50. thousand crowns
which he gave to Laurence de Medicis his Nephew. Luther a Regent Doctor in
divinity, thought the^ he had read, seen, and heard enough to despise such
Indulgences, and to be able to tax therein the authority of the Pope: but
afterward a great number of Auditors running thither, to the end they might
hear some noueltye to delight them, the popular wind, no less then the
favor of the Duke of Saxe, one of the electors of the Empire, and the greatest
landed of all Germany, so egged him forward that he did not only band himself
against the power of the Popes, and authority of the Church of Rome, but
yielding himself to the anger conceived, for the injuries and sharp pursuites
of the Receivers, and such as spurned against him, he grew in the end to make
open war against the doctrine of the Church. The Pope as they say bestirred
himself well in the beginning for to quench this fire, but not using the
proper remedies and medicines, Luther cited to Rome.
he did but impair so great a malady, for he cited Luther to Rome, he forbad
him to preach, and after seeing of his disobedience, he gave him over to the
censure of the Church, never himself in all this time abstaining from many
things of evil example: which having been with reason blamed by Luther, were
by his Sermons, lessons, and writings, rendered a great deal more odious to
every man: so as proceeding against him with Ecclesiastical weapons, without
amending matters of evil example in his own Court at Rome, (and which since
they were made and constrained to reform) so much the more grew the reputation
of Luther among the people, as they saw him more persecuted for the innocence
of his life, and pure doctrine which he preached then any thing else. And
albeit that many were of opinion both at Rome and elsewhere, that it were less
inconvenience to dissemble the fire of such folly, which peradventure would
grow of it self into smoke, then in kindling and blowing it through the
sharpenes of such pursuites, to make it increase and grow in greater blaze
then before: and chiefly for that a little wealth and honor had in the
beginning, made him to eat his word, namely, at such time as he was banished
by the Emperor at the Diet of Worms, assuring themselves to have seen him in
such a fright, as if the injurious and threatening words of the Cardinal S.
Xixte, Legate had not led him to a last despair, he would gladly enough have
been reconciled to the Church, and been made to leave his opinions. So it
came to pass (as men are rather inclined to remedy inconveniences by
vehemence and rigor, then fair means and courtesy) that not only the
persecutions which augmented daily against him and his Lutheranes, but also a
terrible excommunication being resolved against the Duke of Saxe, rendered this
Prince more fervent the^ ever, to the defense of the cause. True it is that the
opinion which was held among many Princes, that the followers of this doctrine
were no less enemies to the temporal Lords, then to the authority of the
Churchmen, was an occasion that many soueraign and other Magistrates, What
caused a stay of Luthers reformation.
diligently hindered, and with great severity, the publication thereof in their
countries. Besides that the multitude and contrariety of most absurd heresies,
which crept in at that very time, did maruelously retarde the beginning, yea
and bring a marvelous abatement to the doctrine it self: but the liberty
which the people in the end resumed in their manner of life, (I will hold my
peace as concerning the merit of the doctrine) and the covetous obstinacy of
great ones, who could never be brought to leave any more their ancient manners,
then the goods which they usurped of the Church, did add unto him so strong
wings, that many presaged his more high and loftye flight, then has as yet
been seen, howsoever in a word to teach perticularlye the beginning of his
reformation.

Martin Luthers beginning, profession, and carriadge of life.
Martin Luther borne the 10. of November 1483. at Islebe in the Countye of
Mansfelde, sent to Magdeburg and Iscena to plye his study, and then being
given altogether to Logique and Philosophy at Erforde, shortly after rendered
himself Munke in the Convent of Augustines, against the will of his parents
and friends, giving himself to the study of Divinity, Luther himself
confesses it in his answer to the book which H. D. of Brunwick wrote against
him 1541. as Sleyden reports in the 14. of his history, repeating Luthers
words, who discovered the occasions which moved him to preach and write against
pardons. My name, says he, began to grow famous because no man was found else
that durst oppose himself. This little glory was pleasing as then unto me, etc.
in liew of the Civil and Cannon law, to the expectation whereof as well his
first bringing up, as the desire of his parents would have destined him. So as
Stupice Vicar of the order of the Augustines, who had the charge of the
University lately erected at Witemburge in Saxe upon the River of Albye, made
Luther go thither to read Divinity Lecture: since being returned from Rome,
whether in the year 1510. his brethren had sent him to solicit and follow a
suit which they had there, he passed himself Doctor at the expenses of Duke
Frederic of Saxe, elector of the empire, under whom as he seldom employed
himself but in his study, and that more then 2. thirds of Christians, with
one consent approved the faith and catholic Roman religion, the sudden and
unlooked for accident of general pardons, occasioned him though unskillfully,
to debate in the beginning, by way of College disputations, some points
different in Religion. Afterward the fire of an ambitious anger, inflamed by
the indiscreet covetousness of certain Questors, increased by the injurious
gain-sayinges of such and other his adversaries, joined thereto the zeal which
he had to guide the more simple sort, in a way which seemed better unto him,
encouraged him to reform and in the end to reject almost all the doctrine
which had been generally received of our fathers, as soon as he saw himself
excommunicated by the Pope, and banished by the Emperor Charles the fifth,
1519. See here the beginning of pardons, and true motife of the Croizade, the
fruits whereof at first being ordained for the defense of the Christian faith
and nation, were employed notwithstanding as you shall perceive.

Selim King of Turks, a natural and ancient enemy to the Christians, had
made himself in that time so much more dreadful to them all, as besides the
consideration of his new conquests, whereby he had increased the Ottoman
empire, he dreamed of nothing more puffed up by reading of the happy carriages
of Alexander the great, then to make the conquest of the world more easy to
himself then the other: for having caused Bajazet his Father (who had thought
to have made Acomat his eldest brother King) with Acomat, Corcu his brethren,
and all their race to be murdered, Selim King of Turks dreadful to his
enemies.
was half persuaded to have done as much to his own only son Solomon: he
tamed the Aduliens, defeated the Zophy in battle, took Tauris chief City
of Persia, and part of the Realm, which being forced to leave for want of
victual, Selims cruelty toward his father, brethren and race.
and turning toward Syria, overthrew two Souldanes of Egypt, and after having
made a clean end of Mamelus race, principal of the Souldanes, he invested
himself in their kingdoms, for government whereof having left a Lord in
Caire, chief City of the Country, almost doubled his reuennues, and
entertaining arms both by Sea and land, for the execution of higher intents,
made himself so horriblye feared of his neighbors, as the less assured took
all pains to animate the rest of the Potentates to oppose themselves against
his enterprises: who fearing least the good hap of his so great victories
achieved, would make his heart swell to the aspiring of their ruin, chiefly
considering that he so prosperously accompanied his power and valor with a
burning desire of making himself a Monarque, and by his famous enterprises,
his name appeered most glorious to posterity: determined at the earnest
soliciting of the Emperor Maximilian, and Pope Leo, to make the greatest
mass of men, armor, and money, that they were able, to the end they might at
least exclude his entry into Christendom, if they found not themselves able
to perfourm any way his ruin: imagining that he would attempt Rhodes or
Hungary, if he meant not to discende into Italye, by the example of Mahomet
his Grandfather, Pope Leo endeavors the Christian Princes to enter league
against the Turks.
who surprised Otrante with a very small power which he sent thither. The Pope
then and the whole Court of Rome after certain solemn Processions, in which
they went barefooted, sent briefes to all Princes, to give them warning of the
imminent danger, and to pray them that all their quarrels set aside, they would
readily advise for the defense of Religion and common health, growing so
uncertain, if by a general force and agreement they would not make war in
Turkey, to assail the enemy in his own home: whereupon having well considered
of the estate between the Turks and Christians, it was resolved that the
Emperor accompanied with Hungarians, Polonians, and Germans, should set
forward through Danube in Bossine, (anciently Misia) to the end to pass into
Thracia, and so approach Constantinople, the chief seat of Ottomans: that the
King of France with the Italians and Zuissers, should pass from the Port of
Brundiese into Albanie, How the Christians army should be bestowed to annoy
the Turk.
(a very easy and short passage) to conquer Greece, which being peopled with
Christans, and in general too rigorously handled by the Turks, was in a
manner ready to reuolte, that the King of Spaines, Portugal and Englands
forces, joined by Sea at Carthage, and havens thereabouts, should prepare for
the straight of Gallipoly to assault Constantinople, after having taken the
Dardanes, otherwise the Castles seated at the mouth of the straight, that the
Pope should follow from Ancone with one hundred Galleys, and that for the
maintenance thereof should be made the greatest provision of monye that was
possible, by a voluntary contribution among the Princes, and a form of Impost
free in general to be gathered thoroughout Christendom. This act proclaimed
universal Truce for five years thoroughout Christendom, under pains of
great censures to the breakers thereof: and to the end that all particulars of
greater importance which sprung from so high an affair, might be the better
resolved of the one side and the other, by the advice of the Princes
Ambassadors which were resident about his person, he sent out men of worth and
reputation, (all Cardinals) for his Legates to all Princes. Now albeit this
beginning had bred in the heart of every one, a great hope of a laudable conduct
and mo^^ happy end to ensue the whole plat, yea after the Truce was accepted of
among them, which showed themselves with great vaunts and mighty words, ready
for the execution of such an enterprise, yet each one finding very uneasy the
conduct of a matter so greatly important, the event uncertain, far distance,
and more appertayning to the estates of the one then the other, and which asked
a far longer time to compass among themselves so universal an union and
affection, as was requisite to this action, Christian Princes rather respected
their particular, then the common cause.
the private interests and commodities clean carried away the consideration of
the public. In such sort that these practices were not only not brought to
any assured hope of to come, but were handled lightly, and almost in a kind of
ceremony, each one to acquit himself so of his duty: according to the
nature of men to whom things in the beginning seeming most terrible, do so
diminish day by day, and vanish by little and little in such sort, that
without a chance of new accidents which may renew their fear, they yield
themselves but too soon assured of what may afterward betide them: so as this
negligence of the public cause, and immoderate affection of some particular,
was the more confirmed by the death of Selim, Selim dies, Soliman succeeds.
(whose long sickness had delaied, and his death after clean broken the
preparations of the war) who left so great an Empire to his son Soliman,
young of age, but accounted of a mild spirit and little courage, (though his
effects after showed the contrary) that the Christians not esteeming him borne
for arms, soon enough freed themselves of the fear which they had had of the
actions passed. Notwithstanding before the death of Selim, and during the
occasions as yet they had to fear the Turk, the Emperor assigned a day at
Ausbourge, whether all the Princes christened were summoned to answer. And to
that end Pope Leo sent his Bulls of great pardons throughout all Christendom,
with promise of remission of sins, and kingdom of heaven, to all such as
would help the Church with a certain sum of money: and as well to advance
forward his Indulgences, as to animate the Christians to this war, he
dispatched Thomas Caietan his Legate into Germany. Hereupon the quick and
prompt spirit of Luther, who as the most renowned of his own profession had
already read many sorts of Books, in the most famous University of Germanye,
found the preachinges and cariadges of these Questors very strange. Afterward
coming to doubt of the virtue of pardons, because he said that he never
remembered he found in his books that one ought to make traffic of the sins
of men; and least that they could be redeemed with any money, but the blood of
Christ, since that the Cannon did teach sins could not be remitted by
pardons, no more then that the Preachers ought to sell license, to eat Eggs,
Milk, Flesh, and Cheese, upon days forbidden, promising besides to forgive
all sins, The palorepiscopal mantle, how made and given by Popes.
how great soever, yea and to come, sent out his letters in October 1517. to
certain Prelates of Germany, praying them to take order therein, to refourme
the preachinges and imprinted books of those Questors: and since sent ninety
five propositions (a little before published at Witemburge in manner of a
scholasticall desputation) of Purgatory, Penance, duty of Charity,
Indulgences and pardons, to search out, said he, the truth, and not to
resolve: protesting that he would affirm nothing therein, but submit all to
the judgment of the holy Church. Now he first addressed himself to the
Archbishop of Mayence for the reasons which ensue. Albert of Brandebourge
having been lately by Pope Leo created Archbishop of Mayence, seeing that the
Chaptre and Cannons excused themselves by reason of their former charges, not
to be able to furnish him with monye to buy his Made of the wool of two white
Mattons, set upon the Altar in S. Agnes Church, while Agnus Dei is sung upon
that holy day, and afterward given to the Subdeacons of S. Peter's, who shere
them at shering time, and of the yarne which comes from them among other,
makes a mantle three fingers broad, and reaching from the shoulders to the
calfe of the leg with little knobs of lead at the skirts, from thence laid
upon the corpse of S. Peter and S Paul, with certain prayers, and kept there
one night, with great ceremony, after delivered to him that must have it, and
is only for Archbishops.
Episcopal mantle, which will cost above thirtye thousand Crowns, before it
be brought home, found means by accord with the Pope, to send John Tekel a
Iacobin, to preach pardons (already published else where) throughout all his
Diocese, and to set forth their virtue to all such as would disburse monye,
with charge that half the gain should return to Rome, for the building up of
the Church of S. Peter, for in as much as the Foucres of Germany had impressed
their money, there could not be a better means then this found to repair
them. Such was the first, howsoever the most apparent beginning of our evils,
drawn from a third of wool, which since has been by so many people, in so
many places, and so strongly winded and writhed, as many millions of men have
been thereby hanged and strangled. Now beit for fear of censures, or thunder
of excommunication, which these Questors carried about with them, no man durst
lift up his head to band against them but Luther: many Divines and Lawyers,
to apease the murmures and shut his mouth, began to inueigh against him by a
form of answer to his solate and hardye propositions: among the rest John Tekel
published certain theames clean contrary, at Frankfort on the Viadre, in the
seignorie of Brandebourghe, praising therein above all, the authority of the
Pope, the profit of pardons, and the wooden Cross, which the Pope had caused
to be set up in all Temples, comparing it to Jesus Christ, as Leo to S. Peter:
whereupon Luther taking occasion to manifest himself, sent the explication of
his own to sundry, and even to Leo himself, in June 1518. declaring unto him
what follies his Questors had taught, and their pickerie of the simplier
people, trusting upon or abusing his authority, and for that he doubted he
might be accused toward him, he besought him to give no credit to their
calumnies, considering that Frederick the Elector, the university of
Wittenberge, nor so many other would have approved his actions if there had
been any impiety in them: In sum, he submitted his writings, his life, and
his health to his good pleasure, accounting whatsoever should proceed from him
as from Christ, not refusing to have his head struck of if he would so ordain
it. Hereupon John Eccius a Divine, published to the contrary a Book, entitled
Les Effaceurs, to cote the faults of Luthers writings. But he that most of all
animated him, was Siluestre Prieras, Iacobin master of S. Pallaies, by a book,
where having set down the Pope above the Council, yea and the scripture it
self, which said he had no virtue and authority but from the Church and Pope
of Rome, he seemed to take occasion to digress upon the great virtue of
Indulgences, for Luther setting himself to answer it, said that it was a
book so full of horrible lies and blasphemies against the divine name, that
there is great appearance that Satan was the very author: that if the Pope
(says he) and his Cardinals be of the same opinion, and if the like be held
and taught at Rome, there is no doubt but that it is the true seat of
Antechrist: wherefore Greece and Bohemia were most happy that were separated
from it, and those contrariwise miserable that held never so little thereof:
if then the Pope would not repress this Prieras, if he made him not unsay it,
he protested that he would be at discord with him, and that he would be so
far from acknowledging the Church of Rome for a true church, that he would
contrariwise hold her for a taste of all villainy, and for a place vowed to
all impiety: upon this difference heated by Siluestre, he made him be cited to
Rome, to come and defend his propositions: Leo commanded Caietan rather by
force of the emperor to bring him to Ausbourghe, and from thence to Rome,
commanding all men to obey this commandment, on pain of infamy and loss
of goods: yea giving entire absolution of all sins, to such as would employ
themselves to the execution thereof as abouesaide: and praying Frederic not to
favor him, but to send him away with speed, promising to send him back
again, if he were not found culpable: he warned also that Gabriel a Venetian,
great Vicar of the Iacobins, that he should not suffer him to teach, and
earnestly solicited him by letters and messages, for by extreme diligence
(said he) the fire already kindled must be quenched. As things newly sprung
up cannot carry any great force, but if by delay a mischief be suffered to grow
stronger, it is to be feared, that afterward it may grow incurable,
considering that day by day the evil increased, in which nothing is more to be
shunned then delay: Luther would not go thither, saying that the place stood
very suspicious and dangerous for him, but solicited to have the cause debated
in some free place of Germany. The university of Witemberg wrote in his favor
to Pope Leo, to whom having protested that he would neither think nor speak
against the faith received in the holy Sea, Luther appears before Caietan the
Popes Legate.
gave notwithstanding attestation of his good life and better doctrine, and
besought him to ordain indifferent Judges in Germany: Frederic in the end
dealt so far with Caietan, that by the safe conduct of the Emperor, he
should be admitted to defend his cause at Ausbourghe before him, without going
at all to Rome: who set before him that he should repent himself by
acknowledging of his error, and that he should no more wright ought which
might trouble the peace of the Church: for the first, he said he could not
acknowledge that he had failed, but for the second he would obey it. But
Caietan telling him that he did not esteem so highly of the Popes authority as
he ought, and that in his propositions he should say the merits of Christ were
not the treasure of Indulgences, (contrary to the decree of Clement the sixth)
and that faith is necessary to such as would receive the holy Sacrament, in
sort that they assured themselves their sins were pardoned; It is false (said
he) before diverse witnesses, one Notaire, and four Councellers of the
Emperors: and protested that he had ever honored and reverenced the Church of
Rome, and that if he had said ought repugnant thereunto, he would not abide by
it: but in that he was urged to renounce his error, he said he did not
think that ever he spoke any thing contrary to the scripture, opinion of
ancient fathers, decree of Popes, or the right reason it self. Notwithstanding
for that he confessed he might fail, a matter natural to man, he submitted
himself to the knowledge of the holy church, and refused not that the
universities of Germany and Paris should yield their opinion, requiring then
that the knowledge of the fact might be sent to the Pope, nothing being able
to come more pleasing unto him, then to have the voice of the Church upon the
same: he acknowledged how he had been too bitter and less reverent toward his
dignity, but the fault was to be laid upon th'importunitye of the Questors,
and prayed that he might be pardoned, promising ever after greater modesty,
and that even in his preachings he would content the Pope, and would speak no
more of pardons, if they would likewise shut up the mouths of his adversaries:
Luther apealeth from Caietan.
whereupon seeing that Caietan pressed him so sore to recant, otherwise
threatened him with pains ordained by the Pope, and excommunication if he
repented not, he was cou^celled to appeal from him to the Pope. The appeal
contained that the question of Pardons had been disputed by many, and yet never
certainly determined; and that in such questions it was lawful especially for
Divines to dispute, the which he the rather did, by reason of so sottish
Questors, as exacted the people in so many kind of sorts, and yet not to
affirm any thing therein, but the better to know the truth, leaving the whole
to the judgment of the most learned and Leo himself. Notwithstanding by the advice of the B. of Scoli and Prieras his Judges established by the Pope, he
had been cited to Rome, and from thence the cause sent back to Caietan, whom as
suspected he might well have refused, yet for all that he rendered all
obedience, but seeing himself still pressed to recant, threatened with great
pains, yea and ready to have had worse, grieved with such preiudicies, The
foundation of pardons and Indulgences.
he appealed from an ill informed Pope to a Pope better councelled. The decree
of Clement which he so urged, is in the extrauagants of the Cannon, where
speaking of the benefit of Christ, he says that one drop of his blood was
sufficient to have redeemed mankind, but so much being shed as nothing whole
and entyre rested behind, it was left for a great treasure to the use of the
Church, commanding Peter and his successors to distribute the same as good
Stewardes, to such as should be truly repentant, and confess their sins, in
pardoning them such temporal pains as were due unto their sins, adding
thereunto the merittes of the Virgin and other Saints, so as this treasure
could not be drawn d^ye. Now as he founded the virtue of pardons upon this
decree, Luther on the other side maintained that there was nothing committed to
Saint Peter and his successors but the Keys and administration of the word, by
which Christ would that in a full affiance in him they should pronounce
remission of sins to the believers: and if that the decree did agree with so
true a sense of the Scripture it was then good, if otherwise, false: besides
that the merittes of Saints were clean repugnant to the word, for what men
soever they be, they do never more then they ought, nay they never come near
their duty, and therefore not saved but by the mere mercy of God. As
touching that council which approved the souerainty of Popes to be above
councils, see what it is in the 4. and 5. session of the council of Constance,
as in sundry other, it was ordained that the Pope should obey the ordinances of
the council, and ratified in the 3. and 8. session of that of Basle, but
Eugene 4. not willing to be present at that of Basle, as much as he was thither
cited, declaring it of no force, assigned another at Ferrara 1438. from Ferrara
they went to Florence, where the Popes soueraigntye was established above the
Church and all Christians, whereas Luther referred himself to the University
of Paris, it was for that Gerson a Doctor in Divinity, much renowned at Paris,
having been at the council of Constance, sent thither among others by the
university, and having greatly allowed that decree by which the Pope was made
in subjection, he therein was followed by them of Paris, and a number of others,
he died 1429. And before that Luther had ever put any thing in light, that
University had appealed from Pope Leo to a Council, because that he with
Frauncis the first had abolished La Pragmatique Sanction, very profitable for
Scholars, to whom it opened the door of offices, charges and honors
throughout the whole Realm.

Now as since upon Leo his sending to Frederic, Charles Miltit a Germane his
groom of his Chamber, with letters to sundry other to cause them to abandon
Luther, and Miltit seeing of him more supported, had found sundry means to
appease him, and reconcile himself to Leo, Luther eager against the Court of
Rome.
had not the disputation of Eccius at Lipse against Luther, which he grounded
upon the difference of the Popes supremacy, clean dashed all these hopes: for
Luther not able to leave his eagerness against the Court of Rome, proffered
greater injuries then ever, tearming it more wicked and corrupt then Babylon or
Sodom, that she was the sincke of impiety, to which naught could be added, and
that Antechrist put thereto his helping hand: saying that he greatly grieved
that Leo did remain among them like a Lamb among wolves. S. Bernard, quoth he,
lamented the estate of Pope Eugene, when as Rome was less filthye: but now
that she is the receate and bottomless gulf of all villainies, there is much
more reason to bewail her: further he besought by letters the new Emperor
Charles the fifth, as a puissance established by God, to render justice, and to
supporte the weak against the injury of the more mighty, that he would
protect him, considering that he wrote nothing but by constraint of his
adversaries, and what was approved by the best men of knowledge in all Germany:
joined withal that he offered to recant, if his errors might be proved: he
professed as much before the Electors, the B. of Magdebourg and others. In
sum all the Princes lightly regarded it save Frederic, who in the end
flatlye refused to send him to Rome, and less to punish him. Now Frederic
standing in much awe of the Pope, and yet carrying some affection to Luther, for
that he saw him so much profit his Subjects and other of his University, was
very desirous that this difference might have been passed over with meekenes,
without displeasing the one side or the other: but being solicited on both
parts, in the end he resolved to behave himself according to the advice of
the most sufficientest personages of all his Country: therefore not
attributing so great authority to himself, as to be able alone to judge of
this doctrine, he demanded the opinion of sundry aged and learned men: yea
often of such Princes, Lords, and Gentlemen as were of his acquaintance: Among
other he would needs hear Erasmus speak at a Diette which the Emperor
Charles the fifth held in the City of Cologne, after his coronation: causing
him then to come unto him, he declared amiably, that amidst all these debates,
he had rather the earth should open and swallowe him up quick, then cleave to
any false opinions, or favor them the least that might be, against the
general approved doctrine: but that if Luther justly taxed the errors, and set
forth the springes of a more pure doctrine, he would never contrary the truth,
what evil soever should befall him or his, as he foresawe it, that he would
not too much stick to his own advise, Erasmus his opinion of Luther.
but desired to understand the mind of the more learned, coniuring Erasmus
freelye to deliver unto him his opinion. Who beginning his speech with a kind
of smyling, saying that Luther had committed two great faults: first in
touching the bellye of the Monks, next the crown of the Pope, then coming to
the matter, confessed that Luther had great cause to tax certain errors,
considering that faults in the Church, increasing by as natural a corruption
as diseases did in man's body, reformation then was, and all times had been
necessary in the Church, but that it ought to be handled with discretion,
without difiorming the Church, no more then man's body, to restore it to
health. He added likewise that the summarye of Luthers doctrine was true, but
that he could have wished a greater temperance and modesty in the proceeding
thereof: Laurence Bishop of Virtzbourge, wrote the very same to th'elector
Frederic, Luther condemned by Pope Leo.
affirming he had taken the opinion of many learned men therein, so as Frederic
persuaded by the authority of such and like personages of value, made
afterward no difficulty in maintayning Luther against the Churchmen. About
the sixth of Iulye 1520. Pope Leo having called together the Senate, the
College of Cardinals, and a number of learned men as he affirmed in his
Letters to Frederic, sent every where his Bull out, in which after alleging
certain textes of Scripture fit for his purpose, I pray Christ, says he,
Saint Peter and Saint Paul, and all the he and she Saints of Paradise, to
turn away such danger from the Church, as Luthers writings might bring,
afterward reciting certain articles drawn out of his doctrine, he reproved
them, commanding all Magistrates and other to shun it, under a pain set
down to every one according to his quality, as a thing repugnant to Christian
charity, and to the reverence which all men ought to bear toward the Sea of
Rome: further willing that such books of Luther as contained like doctrine,
should be publicly burned: commanding him to meddle no more with teaching;
to whom he gave threescore days to reform himself, abolish his books, and
publicly recant his doctrine, otherwise he abandoned him as an Heretic and
excommunicate person, and willed he should be punished according to the laws:
forbidding all men to haunt him, comprehending under the same law all such as
should do the contrary. But he standing advertised of his condemnation at
Rome, repealed his appeal the seventeenth of November 1520. and more crossely
then ever maintained the Pope to persist in his tyranny and impiety: as being
so far out of the way, as to have condemned him, without calling him, hearing
him or conuicting him of any error; his appeal grounded upon many points:
First, for that without having heard the matter, and without being convicted,
he condemned him at his pleasure. Secondly, that he commanded him to reject
all faith necessary to the Sacraments. Thirdly, that he preferred his own
opinions and rauinges before the Scriptures, and that he referred nothing to
any council, which he offered to approve whenever it pleased his superiors.
Then he besought the Emperor and the rest of the Magistrates, that for the
honor of God and defense of a Councels liberty, Luther appealed again from
the Pope.
they would receive his appeal, that they would bridle the tirannie of the
Pope, that they would not account his Bull any manner of way able to touch the^,
and that they would innouate nothing, until the cause might be worthily
pleaded: for all this notwhithstanding the Pope urged Frederic to burn all his
Books, and that he should either cut of his head, or making him Prisonner
deliver him up to be punnished in example. Frederic prayed him not to proceed
so eagerlye, but to choose good and skillful Personages, to confer of the whole
matter amyablye to give sure safe conduct to Luther, and that his books might
not be burned before he had defended his cause, then if he were convicted by
sure testimonies of the scripture, he would not approve his enterprise, albeit
that already he consented not to his doctrine, and though he should not be
able to maintain his fact, yet he hoped the Pope would not require at his
hands a matter which he could not perform: for the rest he hoped (by Gods
assistance) to fulfill the office of a Prince of the empire and of an obedient
Son to the Church.

To which the deputies of Leo having in vain replied, the end of the
conference was that necessity pressed them to do according to the contents of
the Popes Bull, wherefore anon after they burned Luthers books: then began he
much more eagerlye to go to work, Luther publicly burns the cannon law
and Popes Bull.
for being advertised of all this passed, he assembled together all his
scholars of Witemberge, and in the presence of many learned personages, he
publicly burned the Cannon law, together with the Popes new Bull, the 10. of
December. Afterward to render reason of his exploite he alleged these:
First, that it was an ancient custom to fling corrupt books into the fire, as
it is seen in the Acts of the Apostles: besides, it is his part which is
baptized into Christ, which is a professor and public teacher of the
Scriptures, to combat against false doctrine, and propose that which is
wholesome for mankind; as touching the Pope and his sequel, they are so
miserable and accursed, that they do not only withstand the holy ordinances,
but condemn the doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, to make their own shine
for the brighter: from the^ceforth he employed himself ever after to write
against the excessive abuses and mischiefs, which he said was in the Court
and doctrine of Rome, as others on the other side very bitterly maintained the
contrary, each with many injuries and reciprocal inuectiues far unworthy of
Christians. So as a certain desire of honor, stirred up by a duty to the
explaining, according to his charge of the holy scripture, made him become so
resolute and stubborn, by the peevish thwarts of his adversaries, that then he
became open banker out to the catholic and romain doctrine, so as having been
summoned to the Diet of Worms, whither he had the Emperors safe conduct, to
render an account of his faith, there to be punished or justified according as
he should maintain; he said frankely the 18. of April 1521. that he would not
recant one inch, except lawfully they made the contrary to appear unto him,
being the cause that the Emperor on the next morrow sent his letters to the
assemblye of Princes, in which he contained that his ancestors who had made
profession of Christian Religion, had ever obeyed the Church of Rome: now since
Luther oppugned the same, his duty was to follow the steps of his
Predecessors, and to defend Christian Religion, in succouring the Church of
Rome: wherefore he determined to banishe Luther and his Adherents, and use
other remedies fit for the quenching of this fire: but because of his faith,
which he had plighted, he would send him home safe. The 24. of April the
Archbishop of Treuues, and other of the Lords called him to them, where after
having wished him to recant, or at the least submit his writings to the
judgment of the Emperor, and of the council of the Princes and general
council to come: he would not in any case but that all should be resolved by
the authority of the holy scripture, which Eccius the Lawyer and others said
was not reasonable, considering the diverse sense of Scripture, which every man
interprets after his own fancy: and that further, by this means should
never any thing be sure or clearly determined, that it was not to be suffered
that every man should ask a reason of every point, as of a matter impossible
in nature. Brief, that since it was not a thing reasonable, to dispute a
matter already resolved or condemned by the Church, men ought simply and
absolutely to hold that doctrine which their good Fathers had left unto them.
In sum Charles the 5. of the age of one and twenty years, Luther banished by
Charles his letters pattents at Worms.
banished him the eight of May 1521. by his Letters Pattentes, by which
considering it was his duetye to take order that no filthe should enter into
the Empire, by the example of his Predecessors; he assembled all the Princes
and States of the Empire at Worms, where he communycated the matter of
Luther, and diligently examyned it. Now albeit the laws forbid to hear a
manifest heretic, so many times condemned and separated from the communion of
the Church, yet to stop the passage to all calumny, he sent him a letter and
dispatched his Herald with safe conduct, to cause him to come unto him and
render account of his writings: afterward having recited the propositions,
desseines, Luthers answers and all that had passed at Worms, he said that in
case Luther did still defend his errors, and wilfully persevere in them, he
approved the Popes bull, and to witness that he would maintain it, he condemned
and banished Luther as an author of schism, and an obstinate heretic,
commanding al men to hold him for such: and after 21. days which he gave him
of favor to reclaim himself he charged every man with all force to endeavor to
take him and deliver him up into his hands: he banished also all such as any
manner of way whatsoever favored him, enioyning his books to be utterly
abolished, with great pains from thence forward for any booke-binders that
should sell any of them; and ordained that his decree made in the council of
the Princes and all the estates should remain for ever inviolable.

Luther then much spiting at his having been thus condemned, and his books
burnt by the Deuines of Cologne and Louaine, after 1521. by those of Paris, was
at Rome given up to the Devil, the 28. of March 1521. by the Pope, together
with all heretics, Pirates, Imposers of new tributes, falsefiers of Bulls,
Merchants furnishing the enemies of the faith with weapons, or other things
forbidden, Massacrers, possessors by violence, and other which they are
accustomed to condemn and curse the Maundy Thursday before Easter, in the Bull
which they call In caena Domini: Afterward banished by the Emperor in a
general assembly of the Princes of the empire: you may not doubt if he were
then put into a heat to skirmish more eagerly then ever he did, so as that
being published throughout, and otherwise pricked forward by the threats and
outrageous speeches of Cardinal S. Kiste and other his adversaries, and
besides seeing himself supported as well by Frederic Duke of Saxe his Mecenas,
as many other Lords, gentlemen, and great personages, attempted (a matter which
never before he durst so much as have dreamed of) clean to abolish the Mass
by his writings which he published, to that end at Witemberg. First with
Frederic whom by little and little he gained as well by his own arguments, as
by the authority of Philip de Melancthon, a professor at Witemberge, The Mass
first abolished in Germany.
Iustus Jonas and other to whom this Prince had given in charge, to examine the
consequence of so notable a change, afterward in many places of Germany, so as
leaving that fear which had as it were before bound him fast with the chains
of modesty, he durst then make open war against the Pope and all other that
would maintain his doctrine, by the same weapons themselves used, beginning to
effectuate the Prophecy which he turned to himself, of John Hus and Hierosme
of Prague. The Bohemians to witness the great displeasure which they conceived
at those men's deaths at Constance, caused pieces of money to be coined which
they called Hussites, about which were engraven those words which he uttered at
his departure. After one hundred years ye shall answer God and me. As if
knowing they should live no longer, he would have said that the Judges should
the^ come before the throne of God to render an account of their act. But
Luther interpreting it to himself in his commentaries upon Daniel, takes it
for a certain prophecy that John Hus should be the forerunner of his
reformation, bringing in John Hus, as if he should say, John Hus prophecieth of
Luther.
they shall roast the Goose, (for Hus is as much to say as a Goose, in the
Bohemian tongue) but they shall not roast the Swan which will come after me.
Indeed he was burned 1414. and the difference moved by Luther upon the
pardons began 1517. Among the cheifest of his adversaries which openly declared
themselves Henry 8. K. of England, presented himself, who above all the rest
disalowed his judgment upon the Indulgences, defending the opinion and power
of the Pope: thence he proceeded utterly to condemn by a book dedicated to
that end, all the disputation of the Sacraments of the church, taking his
argument to write upon the Captivity of Babylon caused by Luther: who thereunto
answered very bitterlye, not sticking to declare unto him that he made no
account of the dignity or magnificent appearance of any person. Pope Lea
received hereat so great contentment, that he gave unto him the title of
Defendor of the faith, and afterward 1524. Clement 7. of Medices, sent unto
him a Rose of gold, which he had consecrated three months before Easter.

The Emperor visits in person the K. of England.
Hereupon the Emperor being embarked to pass out of Germany into Spain,
where certain seditions were stirred up, in his way visited the K. of England,
to whom the better to assure himself of him against the K. of France, he
promised the 13. of June 1522. at Windsor upon the Thames beyond London, to pay
annually one hundred thirty and three thousand crowns, which the french
yearlye did owe unto the English. And for a greater alliance it was agreed that
in time and place the Emperor should take in marriage Mary, daughter to K.
Henry then of the age of seven years, and that if this accord held not, he
should pay four hundred thousand Crowns.

Luthers doctrine in the mean season dispersed throughout Germany, profited in
many places, Images broken down in Germany.
so far as his Disciples in their abundance not content to go any more to
the Mass, egged the people to the plucking down of Images, and cheefely Andre
Carolastade, for which act being misliked by the University of Witemberg, they
condemned this attempt, showing that it was not the way wherein they ought to
proceed but before all to pull out the Images of the spirit, and to teach the
people that only through faith we please God, Luther misliketh the breaking of
Images by the people.
and that Images served to no end, which being beaten down in the spirit, and
men well taught, the corporal Images would soon fall down of themselves: not
for any mislike they had to have them clean taken away, but that it ought to
be done by the hand of the Magistrate: for it was not permitted to every man to
do according unto his fancy. Shortly after 1523. 1524. Zuinglius did as much at
Zurich in Suizerland, and many other Cantons in like time followed after. In
sum that a man cannot tell how lightly, how secretly, and in what a short
space this doctrine crept into the hearts and brains of many thousands of
Christians, especially then when every one saw that Leo had not employed any
part of the great mass of money come of his pardons against the Turk, who in
the mean time had ruyned Hungary, attempted upon Bohemia, taken Rhodes, and
done a thousand mischiefs against the Christians, albeit that the Pope, the
Emperor, the Ecclesiastical Princes and others, had flung all the stones they
could to the contrary, even causing the Edict and decree of Worms to be
observed against Luther and his doctrine, the which was notwithstanding hindered
as well by the reformed Princes and their partakers, as by the writings and
ancient arguments of Luther and his companions, so as there is no marvel if
the people, Leo 10. dies, Adrian 6. succeeds.
and above all the comminalty of towns, not finding their passions stayed by
any laws or pollitique ordinances, licenced themselves to grow more wilful
in their impressions then ever.

Leo being departed, whose Father was Laurence, and Cosme his Grandfather, who
had enobled and exalted the family of Medices: Adrian the 6. of Vtrech in
Holland, succeeded him 1521. as well in the dignity, as hate and bitter
pursuit against Luther: and the Churchmen seeing the protection which many
Princes gained by little and little, thorough his doctrine, gave to Luther
least any should attempt against his person, turning the effect of their hatred
upon his disciplines, gave a beginning to most cruel and continual
persecutions of the evil affected toward the faith. Now as the seed of this
reformation was taken out of the convent of Augustines, so did they make seen
the first treates of their bitter punishments upon John and Henry, Augustine
Friars of Brusselles, who after many disputations with Jacques Hocstrat, the
Inquisitor a Iacobin, having been deposed of the priestly order, disgraded of
the lesser orders, Adrian dies, Clement 7 de Medices succeeds.
clad with lay and profane habites, after delivered up to the secular
Justice, were burned alive the first of July 1523. Hereupon Adrian died the 13.
of September 1523. to whom Clement of Medices 7. succeeded, under whom the
doctrine of Luther began to creep in amidst the French: among whom albeit
covertly and secretly the Lutheranes were soon enough suspected and known:
afterward examined of their faith, were very often pursued by the Clergy, so
as the French army being broken up, and the King taken before Pauie by Fernand
Daual Marquisse of Pescaire, Charles of Bourbon, and Charles De Launoy Viceroy
of Naples, 14. of February 1525. who carried him prisoner into Spain, his
mother Loyse regent in his absence, desiring in this so great an affliction, to
entertain the good favor of Christian Princes, especially of the Pope,
besides the good affection and singular reverence which by her letters she
protested to carry toward the Church of Rome, Letters from the Pope to the
Parliament of Paris
demanded at their hands succor against such an accident, and Council how
she might stay the course of heresies, which were already hatched thorough
out the whole Realm. Then Clement the seventh besides his private letters full
of hope and comfort, signified from Rome the 20. of March 1525. to the
Parliament of Paris, that he had understood by letters from the regent, how
those wicked heresies began to slide thorough the whole Realm; and whom by
great prudence and good advise, they had deputed certain, to whom they gave
charge to see the punishment of such as strove to abolish the faith and
ancient Religion: whom so deputed he confirmed by his own authority. It is
necessary, says he, that against this great and maruailous disorder, sprung
from the malice of Satan, and the rage and impiety of his supporters, the
whole world should bend their forces, to preserve the common health:
considering that this forcenerie would not only confound and broyle Religion,
but also, all principality, Nobility, laws, orders and degrees. For his own
part he would neither spare any diligence or labor, to remedy such an
inconvenience: that they in like sort whose prudence and virtue has every
where been highly renowned, ought to employ themselves to the preserving of
the true and right faith: And moreover, that to the end the weal of their
Realm, and dignity of their estate should be exempt, from the peril and
domestical mysteries which this pernicious and pestilent heresy sowed round
about, they needed not to be pricked forwards, considering how great
testimony of their prudence they had already yielded; yet to make his duty
appear, and show the good will which he bore unto them he would do no less
then add this. For that which they hitherto had done, was most agreeable unto
him, and was the cause why he exhorted them, from thence forth to keep good
watch against so mischievous a plague of heretics, for the honor of God and
safety of the Realm. In some he assured them that this their diligence
should be greatly acceptable to God and worthy of much praise before men, that
he in like sort would set to his helping hand, and give unto them aid and all
possible favor.

Upon this then the Divines of Paris, during the imprisonment of King Francis
the first tormented greatly among other, Iacques Le Feure of Estaples, King
Francis writes in the behalf of Iacques Faber
who has left behind him many books in Philosophy, and Divinity. In sort
that he was enforced to retire out of France. The King advertised hereof
especially by the recommendation of his sister Marguerite, who greatly favored
Le Feure for his virtue, sent letters to the Parliament of Paris, in which he
signified how he had been given to understand, that they had indicted Iacques
De Feure, and sundry other of excellent knowledge before them at the pursuit of
the Divines who deeply hated Le Feure, for even before his departure out of
France, some of that faculty had highly accused him before himself, but
wrongfully and without cause. That if it had been so, says he, he gave charge
to the greatest personages and most notable in all erudition to canuisse out
his books and writings wherewith he was charged, which they diligently
executing, and every thing thoroughly examined, a most ample and honorable
testimony was delivered unto him touching the said Feure, considering then
that the truth is such as he did afterward understand: that he was highly
esteemed among the Italians and Spaniards for his doctrine and virtue, he would
stand maruailously discontented, if they should offer any injury, or put in
any danger so innocent a person. And for that, at that instant he meant to have
justice more rightly and rigorously administered thoroughout his Realm then
before; as also for that he resolved to show all favor and amity toward
learned men, to that end he commanded that if they had put any men of
knowledge in question since his departure, that it should be suspended by his
mother the regent to the end he might be advertised by her, and that they
should therein attend his intention and good pleasure: In the mean time not to
proceed any further: but surcease until his return, which he hoped would be
shortly by the grace of God, or until that he or his mother should be
otherwise advised. These letters were dispatched to go from Madrila City in
Spain the 12. of November, and presented unto the Parliament of Paris the 28.
of the same month.

League between the regent and Henry the 8. King of England.
Loyse shortly after seeing that she was not able to wind the Emperor to such
an accord as she desired for the delivery of her son, made alliance with
Henry the 8. King of England, about the end of August 1525. The first Article
purported that they should employ them selves to the repelling of the Turks
strength and courses, together with the pestiferous sect of Luther, no less
dangerous then the Turks. Now as the Emperor, perceiving the King to grow
very sick in respect the pretended accord could take no good effect, feared
least by the increasing of his sickness he might loose thorough a sudden
death, so certain advantages as presented themselves he went to see him at
Madril, comforted him and put him in better hope then ever. In the end the 14.
of January 1526. the treaty was concluded. Among the Articles whereof, it was
specially set down that the Emperors and Kings principal end was to have the
enemies of the faith and heresies of the Lutherans clean rooted out: And that
a peace being concluded between them, Peace concluded between the Emperor
Charles and Francis ye first
they should settle the common wealth, and undertake a war against the
Turks, and heretics excommunicate, and cut off from the communion of the
Church. A matter above al most necessary, and to which the Pope had often
dealt and solicited them to become watchful. To satisfy then his good
pleasure, they resolved to beseech him to command Ambassadors from all
Kings and Princes, to meet at a day in some certain place, with general
charge and commission, to advise how they might well make a war against the
Turk and defeat the heretics enemies of the Church, that the Pope would
permit every Prince according to custom, to leauie money in his own
Country, for so holy and charitable a work: and also suffer them to leauie
some dismes upon the Clergy. In sum the Princes prepared themselves of all
hands to feast well the Lutherans.

Their number increased notwithstanding from day to day: Suissers reformed.
especially after the disputation at Berne, whether many of the Zuisser Cantons
sent of their people to answer, Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Bucer, Capito,
Blaurer and other. The conclusion thereof was made the 25. of January 1528, at
such time as the Articles published by them were approved by the voice of the
greater part, and put in practice by the authority of the Magistrate as well
at Berne, as sundry other places adjoining: the Mass, Aulters and Images being
clean put down. They of Constance had already made a beginning under Ambrose
Blaurer: But after this disputation they did as the Bernois, and they of Basle
likewise in the beginning of February 1529. Those of Geneue did in like sort,
by reason whereof the Bishop and Clergy standing terribly anangred, quitted
the town 1528. Whether many French men persecuted for their conscience, Geneue
a first retreat to French Lutherans.
began as then to retire. But in Germany the Lutherans held up their head,
fearing nothing but the Emperor and some few other, against whose enterprises
they began already to league them selves. Now whereas the Emperor had assigned
a day at Spire, to resolve there of the matter of Religion, of the decree of
Worms, and war against the Turk, it was agreed that they should attend a
general Council: and that for the decree of Worms every man should in the
mean time so govern himself in his Religion, without altering ought in any
sort, The decree of Spire permitted every man to maintain his Religion
without alteration.
as he might be able to render a good account to God and the Emperor. Before
this decree 1526, the Prince of Saxe and the Landgraue, called unto the^ the
deputies of Strasbourgh, Noremberg, Ausbourgh, and others to whom they
delivered, that by reason they saw the Bishops and other Papists machinate
some thing against them, for cause of their Religion, it were good to practice
some league and alliance, to the end that if any should be in peril for this
profession, he might be succored of the rest: but there was nothing as then
concluded, saving that the deputies having received no charge thereto,
demanded a time to communicate thereof. Now as afterward in March 1529 they
repeated in the self same assembly at Spire, what had been concluded
touching the decree of Worms, The beginning of the league of Smalcade among
the Protestants.
and alleged that many abused the same (for under color of the decree, men
defended and excused all horrible doctrines) it was ordained that such as
until that time had observed the Emperors Edict, should continue until a
Council, (whereof the Emperor gave hope) and constrain the people to do the
like, that they which had received other doctrine then they were able to quite,
for fear of sedition, should take heed not to innouate any thing until then.
And that their doctrine which taught otherwise then the Church, touching the
supper should not be received nor the Mass abolished, and where there should
be any new fashion of doctrine, hindering such as would go to Mass,
whosoever did the contrary should be proscribed. But the 19. of April, 1529.
the Prince of Saxe, George of Brandebourgh, Ernest, and Francis of Lunebourg,
the Landgraue, he of Anhald opposed themselves to the decree, and in writing
published the occasions of their opposition. Beseeching the rest of the Princes
not to think amiss of that, if therein it agreed not iumpe with them: for as
the former decree (said they) was established by a common accord, so could it
not be broken without all did consent thereunto. One party of the principal
Cities having consulted together, joined themselves with this protestation of
the Princes, to wit, Strasbourg, Noremberg, Vlme, Constance, Ruthelin,
Vuinsseme, Merbinge, Lindaue, Campodun, Hailbrun, Isne, Vuisseburg, Norling,
Saint Gal, to which many more after likewise joined. Whence the name of
Protestants first sprung.
And for that they all protested to follow the first decree of Worms and
reject the new, they were always after called Protestants. Who after that made
and published an act of their appeal, containing by order a narration of all
the matter in which they appealed from the day of Spire, and decree there made
to the Emperor, and a lawful general council to come; or a national of
Germany, and in effect to all Judges of whom there was no cause of suspicion:
and thereupon they dispatched men to the Emperor, to beseech him not to
mislike any thing therein, and in the mean time offered unto him all obedience,
service, and other duties which he could desire at their hands, the which I
have been willing to describe somewhat at large unto you, because there will
oftentimes fall out speech of these Protestants and their league, whereof the
matter fell out thus.

I have already delivered unto you how the Saxon and Landgraue had here before
at the same day of Spire, made entrance to a certain confederation and
alliance, which was afterward sufficiently and diligently pursued, and as
principallye a man advises himself more upon an occasion then at any other
time: in like manner after this decree they much more diligently bethought
themselves, so as they did some little matter at Noremberg, as a project which
was since mightily increased. And in October the Deputies of these Princes and
towns being at Schuabach, it was proposed in the name of Frederic and George
of Brandebourg, that since the defense of Religion was the very motive and
foundation of this alliance, it was above all things necessary that all their
wills were of accord therein: wherefore they recited a summarye of doctrine,
The opinion of the Supper being diverse among the reformed, is cause of great
inconveniences.
which was approved of all, but they of Strasbourgh and Vlme said, that in
respect there had no mention at all been made thereof in the precedent
assembly, it passed their charge to deal therein. The opinion of the Supper
grew diverse, which was the only hindrance thereof: the one holding the opinion
of Zuinglius, that men took the body of Christ by faith: the other of Luther,
that men eat it really: which being the cause that at that time they could not
conclude of ought, they ordained an other assembly at Smalcade 13. of December.
The Protestant deputies being brought into Plaisance in Lombardie, to give the
Emperor to understand the reasons of their appeal, had answer, that that was
done for fear of novelties, and to be meet as well with all kind of sects
to come, as such as at this day wandered throughout, and to establish a peace
in all Germanye, so as they ought not to make any difficulty for letting it
pass; joined withal that the custom did not carrye, that what was ratified
by the greater part of the empire, should be disanulled by a few, which must
needs cause him to write to the Duke of Saxe and his companions, commanding
them to consent thereto, or else he would cause such a punishment, as all
should take example thereby, which they of themselves ought to have done,
considering how much the Turk at this day wasted Hungary: and albeit that they
furnished all against the Infidels, yet except there were a mutual consent by
a peace, and brotherly benevolence among the estates, no thing could be brought
about aduantagious against so puissant an enemy: the Deputies notwithstanding
gave up their appeal in writing, and in the end had leave to depart, so as
all being delivered in council, the 14. of October 1529. the Princes and
others assembled toward the end of November at Smalcade, where the difference
of Religion hindering as yet any resolution, they departed under condition,
that whosoever would in each point consent to this doctrine and receive it,
should meet at Noremberg the sixth of January 1530. there to deliberate of what
were to be done. Now they concluded nothing but to tarry until the day which
the Emperor should publish in the Spring, which was at Ausbourg, the 8. of
April 1530. Charles the fifth elected Emperor in June 1519. at Francforde upon
the Rhyne, (notwithstanding the contrary pursuites of the French for their
Prince) after the death of Maximilian the 12. of January, and sacred at Aix in
the end of October, was crowned at Bologne le Grass the 24. of February, by
Clement. And whereas upon the 20. of June, when the day assigned by him at
Ausbourg where he made his entry began, he commanded the Duke of Saxe to carry
the Sword before him going to the Mass, (according to the office of Marshall
to the Empire, Hereditarie to the house of Saxe) the Elector would first take
the advice of his Doctors, who persuaded him that it was lawful, considering
that he went thither to execute his office, and not to hear the Mass: he was
there then only accompanied by George of Brandebourgh. After many affairs
proposed and debated, in the end he caused to be published this decree for
religion, that having rejected the confession of the Protestants faith, he
ordained in sum that nothing should be changed in matters concerning faith
and divine service, that whosoever should do the contrary, should be
punishable both in body and goods, that reparation should be made of all the
injuries which had been done to the Churchmen; and to the end this decree
should remain inviolable for religion, he assured that he would imploye all
the means which God had given him thereto, even to the spending of his blood
and life: yea it was forbidden that any should be able to plead in the
imperyall chamber which astonished a great many: for the Emperor took good
assurance of all the rest for the execution thereof: whereupon the Protestants
being assembled the 22. of December 1530. at Smalcade, concluded a form of
alyance to succor one another: to the which the Princes at that instant bound
themselves, and with them many other Lords and free Cities, thinking good to
try therein the King of Denmark, and Princes of Pomerania and Magdeburg, with
all to write to the Kings of France and England, to dissuade them from such
false reports, as their enemies might make run of them and their religion,
which they accordingly did the 16. of February 1531. The Landgraue allied
himself with them of Zurich, Basle, and Strasbourg, in November, upon
condition to succor one another for their religion; but after the breaches
between the five little Cantons and the rest (which passed in certain
reencounters where the reformed had the worst) and the accord made between
them since that, in October 1531. was put this clause, that they of Zurich,
Berne, and Basle, should quit the alliance of the Landgraue, and Strasbourgh
with the five Cantons of K. Ferdinandes. Afterward the 29. of March 1531. they
met again at Smalcade, where they received but slender answers from Denmark
and Pomeranye, they consulted of means how to have succors ready at need, of
men, monye, and munition, and for that they had had the opinion of learned men
before they confederated together, and that Luther had before taught and
published in writing, that it was not lawful to resist the Magistrate, he now
changed his mind, for when as their Lawyers did declare in this meeting that
such a case might be offered as the Laws permitted a man to resist; as they
did in this, he said he was clean ignorant of that point, for that the Gospel
did not impugn the laws pollitick, but often times confirm them: and because
they said that such an accident might arise in which necessity and duty of
conscience did put the sword into their hands, he made a book by which he
admonished all men in general not to obey the Magistrate, The King of France
and England, succor the Lutheranes.
if he sought to employ them in such a war, for they stood well assured how
that the Emperor solicited by the Pope and other, went about some mischief
for them, under color of having a care for the common wealth of Germany: King
Frauncis the first wrote courteously back unto them the 21. of April 1531. with
offer of his help, so did the K. of England the 3. of May. Now after the
decree of Ausbourg the Emperor being solicited by the Pope and other of the
Cleargye, seemed that he would make the Protestants range themselves to the
common doctrine: but for that certain Princes more peaceably addicted among the
Catholics, saw that that could not be brought to pass but with great
inconveniences to all Germanye, considering that the Protestant Princes and
confederate Cities had already prepared themselves, they councelled the
Emperor to assign some days, to examine therein their doctrine, and to seek
means of peace and accord in religion, which often had been assaied and ever
in vain, by reason of the great difference thereof: and that the Princes (as
Luther at other times had done by Pope Leo his Bull) had appealed from the
Decree of Ausbourgh to a future council, to whom properly appertained the
debating of Religion. In the end notwithstanding about the beginning of
October, the Princes wrote again to the deputies Ambassadors for peace, that
if any did think or could prove that their doctrine proposed at Ausbourg were
erroneous in any point, or in default of so doing, would submit himself to the
testimony of the holy Scripture, they held it most agreeable, that if the
Emperor would assign a day at Spire, and give safe conduct and ostages to
themselves, The Protetestants demand of the Emperor.
their associates and Luther, which they meant to bring thither, besides if he
would permit their free and public preachinges, together with the use of the
Supper according to Christ's institution, and not constrain them to make
difference of meats, they or their Deputies would be present with full power:
and if their doctrine were not confuted, they trusted the Emperor would no more
hinder them in their Religion. In the mean time since that they had formed an
appeal to a lawful Council, they besought the Emperor that he would not in
the mean season innouate ought against them. Now besides the point of
religion, the election of Ferdinande to be K. of Romans, Election of the K. of
Romans.
was proposed by the Emperor, and courageously refused by the Duke of Saxe,
(who died about the 13. of August 1532.) and other Protestants, Frederic of
Saxe elector dies.
in favor of whom the King of France had already consigned one hundred
thousand crowns. But in the end of June 1534. by accord made between
Ferdinand and the son of Frederic late departed, it was said among other
things, that he should acknowledge him for K. of Romans without prejudice to
come to the Electors, Accord between Fredederic K. of Bohemia and the D. of
Saxe.
and that within two months the Emperor should ratify the succession of
Frederic, as well to the goods of his Father as his Grandfather: and should
confirm the marriage passed with the Duke of Cleues. In sum the endeuourers
of peace, the Bishop of Maience and elector Palatin, prevailed so far, and
the Turks coming into Austria more, that the Emperor to have succor of all
hands, Peace thoroughout Germany and Religion free.
in the beginning of June 1532. at a day held at Noremberg, confirmed a
general peace throughout all Germany, with forbidding any should be troubled
for Religion until a Council, or if that held not, until the Estates had
found means to appease that difference, upon grievous pains to the breakers
thereof, and promised himself would be a means to the Pope, that a Council
should be published within six months, to begin one year after: or if the
Council should not hold, advice should be taken in the imperial days, to
resolve the whole: to which the protestants promised to do all duty against
the Turk. Concluded the 23. of January, and ratified the second of August, by
the Emperor, and afterward published, the Emperor holding a day at Ratisbone.

Since the Emperor being returned from Vienne in Austria, went into Italye,
where he assured himself of Clement the 7. from thence passed into Spain.
Afterward Clement at the request of King Frauncis, came from Genes to
Marseilles in the Automne 1533. Where to confirm a reciprocal and everlasting
amity, he gave Katherine his Niece to Henry Duke of Orleans, being 15. years
of age, a marriage no less coueted of the one side then the other. True it is
that Clement would never assure himself thoroughly thereof, until he saw them
in bed together. The K. in like sort (notwithstanding any offers and
assurances which the Emperor and other Princes offered unto the Pope, so as he
would not persevere therein,) took no rest until it was accomplished, as well
for the dignity and singular recommendation of that race, and the hope which
his affairs might breed in Italye, as contrariwse, that the Emperor might
soon enough thereby be impaired: Now to the end that such as willinglye
suffer themselves to be commanded by their passions, or in like sort judge
every thing according to the report and opinion of others, may have the truth
delivered of what they ought to believe, of the house of Medices.

The race has appeared very great, highlye renowned, The race and descent of
Medices, in which the translator does desire the indifferent Reader to consider
what scandalous libels have of late years by to humorous affections been cast
out in disgrace of the house of Medices, only to a base the royal race of
Vallois, of this look Guicciardin in his first book, etc.
and most honorable as well among the Christians as many of contrary faith: be
it that you look into the Fathers stock an Italian, or the Mothers a French:
for the first being endewed with the virtues of charity and discreet
liberality (either public or private) for the foundation of her greatness, a
man would judge the pollitique government of the Medices in Florence, much
more worthy of praise, then the reign of a number of other christian Princes:
their power and credit increased by John de Medices, (named of Bicci) contrary
to the Nobles, who sought clean to ruin the whole estate of the town, so as
having been preferred to all their dignities and estates, without ever suing
for any one, peaceable and succourable to all, he dyed most rich and wealthye,
freended of every man: leaving as well for heir of his virtues as his fortune,
Cosme surnamed the great, in respect he was the most famous personage, (not
bearing arms) which ever was seen or read of in any discourse, remarqued above
all his virtues for his magnificent liberality, from whence all men reaped
profit, and advancement in their affairs: even so far as he made search to
help any of the Nobles, or other which he knew stood in any want, to relieve
their disseanes, so as when he was dead, the names of al his fellow Citizens
were found in an inuertour which Pierre his son took of his goods: carrying
the title of Father of the Country, which the Tuscanes caused to be engraven
upon his Tomb. And albeit the life of Pierre and his virtue was much more
short the^ was expected, he left behind him notwithstanding Laurence and
Julian of Medices, so renowned in their time, that he being traitorously
murdered by his enemies (leaving a Posthumus named Clement the seventh) the
Prince of the Turks would not fail, but with speed enough send Bernard
Baudin the murderer to Laurence to use him at his pleasure, so much had he
their honor in recommendation. But so greatly were his graces recommended
through Italy, that even as he living, they balanced his virtue in
counterweight of the vices of the Christian Potentates for maintaining of whole
Italye and all the Princes adjoining in peace, so he being departed, all the
Lords of Italye before rayned with the bridle of his wise councelles, took
such a liberty to their free passions, that Charles the eight, drawn in by
the Duke of Milan against the King of Aragon, for the conquest of Naples, and
as soon the rest of the Potentates banding against him, and since among
themselves Italye never had from that time other occasion, then to mourn the
loss of his presence, whom they knew not sufficiently enough to honor,
considering the greatness of his deserts: he left behind him Pierre, Julian,
and John, which was Leo the tenth.

So as Julian being departed without issue, his goods and credit descended to
Pierre, though chased out of Florence, he was after drowned at the mouth of
Gariglan, leaving for his heir Laurence of Medices, whom Pope Leo and
Frauncis the first married to Madame Magdalaine of the house of Bologne in
Anuergne, predecessors to the Q. Mother, who in stead of the County of
Bologne, enjoyed the County of Lauraguez in La^guedoc; for so much as Lewis 11.
would needs have the County of Bologne in exchange for Lauraguez at the hands
of Bertrande Earl of Anuergne, great Grandfather to the said Queen. See now
the race on the mother side, derived from Robert the last of that name, Earl
of Bologne and Anuergne, (whose ancestors held rank about the Kings before
the Constables, Chancelors, great Chamberlaynes, or other officers of the
crown) who left Guillaume and John his heirs: the first had only Iodhe
married to Philip Duke of Burgundy, and in her second marriage to John K. of
France, to whom by will deceasing without issue, she left the Duchy of
Burgundy. And so the Counties of Bologne and Anuergne came to John her Uncle,
who had John which married Eleonor of Comminges, of whom he had Ioane, whom she
brought to the Castle of Ortais to Guston de Foix her Cousin, brother in law to
Charles the first K. of Navarre, and left her there, fearing least the Earl of
Armignac who had taken from her the Earldom of Comminges should take her to
wife, to the end he might make himself a peaceable Lord: and went her self to
abide with her Uncle the Earl of Durgel in Arragon; but her daughter was
married unto John Duke of Berrie, widower of Ioane of Armignac, dying
notwithstanding without issue, succeeded unto her in the Counties of Bologne
and Anuergne, Mary of Bologne her Cousin germane, The Q. Mother descended out of
the house of Bologne by the mother side.
who was married to the Lord de la Tour, and of Montgascon father to Bertrant
de la Tour, and Gabrielle wife of Lewis de Bourbon, first Earl of Montpensier,
great Grandfather to the Duke living. Afterward came Magdalaine wife to
Laurence of Medices, ancestors to Catherine of Medices, Q. Mother to the K.
living at this present day.

About this time the Landgraue being come into France 1533. got of the K. a
mass of money, to continue the amity which he carried unto the Princes of
Germany, upon the morgage of the Countye of Montbelliard, in the name of Vlrich
D. of Witemberge his Cousin, by the league of Suaube expelled his Duchy, (given
by the same League to the Emperor, who since gave it to Ferdinand in partage)
upon condition that if he were not repaied within three years, the County
should remain unto him, he had besides other money of his liberality, K.
Frauncis aideth the Protestants.
and with that he levied men and recovered the Country, and placed against
his Cousin in May 1534. Afterward paid the first monye back, gratified with an
overplus: upon this Clement 7. who at the marriage of his Niece to pleasure the
K. had made Cardinals Odet de Chastillon, Philip de Bologne, Claude de Guiry,
and John le Venier B. of Liseux, having run sundry fortunes died in the end
of September 1534. Pope Clement dies, Paul Ferneze succeeds.
Paul Ferneze succeeding him, who presently made Cardinals Alexander son to
Pierre Louis his base son, and Ascanio, son of Catherine his base daughter.

As the doctrine of Luther profited in Germany, Flanders, England, Italy, and
cuntries adjoining, France felt it no less, rather it seemed to increase by
the greatness of persecutions, which might be seen, by the hot persecutions
in the year 1534. for searches and informations were no sooner made of the
prisonners, Persecutions in France.
but they were as speedily burned quick, tied to a stake, after swinged into
the air, were let fall into the fire, and so by a pullise pulled up and down,
until a man might see them all roasted and scorched by a small fire, without
complaining, not able to speak, by reason that they had taken out their tongue,
and gagged: Afterward the K. to the end that might not be a means of
diminishing of the Princes of the Empire their amitye toward him, and to turn
away the wrath of God which he feared would fall upon his Realm, for the
opinion of these people made a solemn and general procession to be made at
Paris, where the relic of Saint Geneuiefe patrones of the Parisians
descended, which happens but rarely. In the mean time he excused himself
toward the Protestant Princes by his Ambassador, assuring them that he made
them to be punished for their sedition, not for their faith; to confer
whereof he prayed them to send some of their divines to meet with his, for as
he said Pope Leo had himself heretofore told him, that he must needs
acknowledge many light ceremonies and humane traditions, which were fit to be
changed in time: afterward Guillaume du Bellay called de Langeay, his
Ambassador about them, being assembled 1535. at Smalcade, seeing that he could
not conclude a general alliance with them, (for they ever excepted the Empire
and the Emperor) returned without doing ought, after having exhorted them in
the Kings name, not to receive Mantoue for the place of Council which the Pope
promised, The Pope has no authority to assign a council.
nor any other place without advise of the K. of France and England, who would
do nothing the one without the other. Louis 12. K. of France said, he by his
Ambassador in time past, maintained that it did not appertain to Pope July to
publish a council, without consent of the Emperor and christian Princes, and
because the K. of Navarre was of the same opinion, July excommunicated him, and
under this title Ferdinande K. of Spain seized of the Kingdom of Navarre: the
K. of France is at this present of the same opinion, that he can allow of no
council but in a sure place, not suspicious, where it may be lawful for every
man to deliver his mind. Edward Fox B. of Hereford, Ambassador for the K. of
England, spoke much more affectionately, and showed that his master greatly
affected the same doctrine, which he had already in a great part established
within his Realm, for which the protestant Princes humbly thanked the^,
praying that they would no more suffer such as were of like faith as they, to
be persecuted. After the 12. of December 1535. by a decree made at Smalcade on
Christmas even, they renewed for ten years their alliance which expired at the
end of that year, and deliberating among the rest of provision and munitions,
it was there concluded that they would all receive the confession of Ausbourgh,
and be content to run the same race: among other there were the Princes of
Pomerany, Vlrich of Witemberg, Robert of Bauiere, he of Deuxponts, the Cities
of Ausbourg, Franckeforde, Campodum, Hambourg, and Hanobry, with many more, who
joined themselves at Franckford in April 1536. and after Guillaume de Nassaw,
and albeit that the Landgraue did not accord with them there, in respect of
their claim which was made to the signory of Hesse, yet he promised that if
there should be any outrage for the profession of the Gospel, he would not
abandon them whatsoever ensued thereon. In the end of March 1538. Christian K.
of Denmarck and John Marquess of Brandebourg, brother to the Elector, were
both receued therein. Now for so much as Held who had been sent from the
Emperor to the Germane Princes, to bring them to agree to such a Council as
the Pope had assigned, and therein to resolve upon all their differentes in
religion, etc. could gain nothing, charging them every way, if they refused so
reasonable conditions of Peace, he framed a League, of which he said the
Emperor and King Ferdinande were the authors, the associates to be the
Archbishops of Mayence, and of Salisbourg, Guillaume and Louis of Bauiere,
George of Saxe, Eric and Henry of Brunswich, that it was concluded upon at
Noremberg, upon condition that if any were troubled for the ancient religion,
succor should be ready at hand, and to endure for 12 years under the name of
the holy League, as made for the glory of God, and defense of the Church.
Afterward 1539. the 19. of April at Francforte, the peace of Germany was
accorded upon such conditions: the Emperor grants to the confederates of
the confession of Ausbourg which are at this present, that he will hold a
Colloquie of learned men within 15. months for the matter of Religion, that he
will make an Edict, forbidding any to be disquieted for their conscience, that
the accord of Noremberg and imperial Edict of Ratisbone, shall remain in full
force, if within 15. months Religion were not fullye accorded, this peace
should hold until the first assembly of the Empire, that if a Diette should
happen before these 15. months were expired, then this peace shall take place
until the next: the Protestants should in like sort do their duty and
remain in peace.

In January 1540. The Emperors Interim.
there was a day assigned by the Emperor at Ratisbone for a peace to be
concluded throughout Germany, and a union of faith, and in the mean time was a
colloquie at Worms, to prepare the accord, but being broken by the Emperors
Letters, the whole was referred to Ratisbone, in April whether the Emperor
came in person, in whose name his duty toward the Common wealth, having
been proposed, and certain Divines chosen on the one side and the other, for
to confer with the Presidents, witnesses and Notaires the 27. of April,
Granuelle offered unto them all a book in written hand, which he said had been
presented unto the Emperor, by certain well affected and learned men, as a
matter proper to make both parties of accord, containing the principal points
of the doctrine: wherefore the Emperor was willing, to the end they might have
a lawful argument, and good entrance to the matter, that both parties should
examine it together: approving and reproving as best seemed good unto them: it
was in some corrected, and certain articles approved, other not: so as
contrary to the Catholic Princes minds, and to Conteran the Popes Ambassador,
(who said they would not change ought of the Religion already received, that
the matter of religion ought not to be determined but by a Council, and the
whole should be sent back to the Pope, who for that end had promised one) the
Emperor made a decree the 28. of July 1541. by which he put over the
colloquie of the learned men, and all the affairs to a Council, and for
defaulte thereof, because an opinion was held that the Pope would shun it by
many delays, to an assemblye of all Germany, or the estates of the whole
Empire, he promised to solicit the Pope for a Council, and in defaulte of a
general or provincial, he would ordain a day imperial within 18 months,
to accord Religion, and that the Pope should send thither his Ambassador,
commanding the Protestants not to innouate ought from the accorded articles,
which should stand in force until then, and further suspend the decree of
Ausbourge, enioyning the clergy to reform their life, their abuses, and
Churches after all, one side and the other promised succors against the Turk,
which was come down into Hungary and Austria, and had seized upon Bude,
Hungary, and Pest, having defeated the army of Ferdinande, with great
mortality of the Christians, while that their Princes stood disputing and
quareling together, like people irreconciliable. This was also confirmed in a
day at Spire, in June 1544. And other day was held at Worms in April and
May 1545. where the Emperor referring the matter of Religion to a Council,
(for the Pope had coursed him that he should undertake to decide the matter of
religion by a conference of Lay men, appertaining only to him) would meddle
only in taking order against the Turk: the Protestants contrariwise said, The
Protestants oppose themselves to the decree of the Emperor.
that they would contribute nothing toward it, and much less go themselves,
if they had not first an accord or an assured peace for Religion, by reason of
which, their wives, children, and subjects, might be tormented in their
absence: so as nothing being done, the Emperor ordained a Colloquie for
Religion at Ratisbone among the best learned, in December 1546. where the
Disputers, witnesses, and auditors, being chosen, the Saxon said that he would
not approve of the conditions of the colloquie and revoked his people, after
the Landgraue and other of the Protestants did the like, promising to return
if the colloquie continued. Hereupon the council of Trent, published the year
passed on the 15. of March, began in the end of the year 1546. The Pope having
sent thither as his Legates, John Maria de Monte, Marcel Seruin, Council of
Trent.
and Reinold Pole an Englishma^ all Cardinals, Iacques Mendose came thither to
excuse the emperors absence, upon the testimony which he had often re^dred of
his diligence in purchasing of that assembly, and his duty and obedience
toward the holy Sea, and that which should be ordained. But more then the
Monks orations to the fathers, and publication of the Bull of the Popes great
pardons, there was nothing done, because the Fathers hastened no whit thither,
saving that the 7. of January where besides the Cardinals, were four
Archbishops, thirty three Bishops, two French, five Spaniards, one Illiric,
the other Italians, thirty five Monks, and twelve not Monks: as the number
of Bishops grew somewhat greater the Council began, and after they were all
assembled in the great Temple, and that Mass was said, the Legates read their
Orations to the Fathers. Afterward it was declared how that the Council was
held for three causes: to root out heresies, restore the discipline of the
Church, and recover peace: upon that they said that the fault of the present
calamity ought to be imputed to the Ecclesiastical estate, considering that
none did their duty, nor diligent to labor in the field of the Lord, whence
heresies sprung up like thorns, and albeit that they were not of their own
part the inuenters of any heresies, yet they were to be charged for not well
tylling of the Vineyard, they have not sown the field, they have not plucked
up the Darnell which began to spring up, that they then ought to advise, and
every man to examine his own conscience, and try if he have performed his
duty: it is certain that they were to be blamed, for that all the discipline
of the Church had been so trodden under foot: the third evil is war, which
is a punishment sent from God, in respect of carelessness in religion and want
of discipline: for Christendom stands not only invaded by Turks and
strangers, but also by civil and domestical arms: during that the Kings
combat, or that they which are revolted from the obedience of their Pastors,
do overthrow all order, and pyll the goods of the Church, they have
administered the occasion to the evils, by their most wicked example of life
through ambition and covetousness. God then is the just Judge, which afflicts
them by these means, and yet the pain is much more gentle then their deserte.
True it is that such are happy as endure for righteousness sake, which may not
be applied to those which are worthy of more rude chastisement, that every one
then acknowledge his sin, and endeavor to appease the wrath of God: for if
they do not acknowledge that, there will never be any amendment, and for no
end shall the Council be held, and in vain shall the aid of the holy Ghost
be called upon, it is a singular benefit of God, to have given unto us the
means to begin a council, after the Church delivered from so long and
grievous a shipwreck, taking harbor, is no more nor less restored, then was
Jerusalem after so long a captiuitye. Esdras, Nehemias, and the other
Captains, being returned out of Judea, earnestly admonished the people of
Israel, to confess their own sins and their Fathers, and to call upon the
divine mercy, we ought to follow the like example. He found in that time
scoffers, which sought to hinder, and mocked the Jews, which reedified the
City of Jerusalem: we in our time have no want of people, which undertake
the like, and in effect perform it: but we must march on hardly, in the
assurance of Christ, whose commandment is here executed, and the business set
in hand. But for so much they are here as Judges, they ought well to advise,
not to suffer themselves to be led by their affections, but hold themselves
neat from the hatred of wrath and enmity, not ordaining ought to please man
in this world, nor accommodating themselves to the ears or desire of any
person, but contrariwise yield all honor and glory to God alone: for all
estates are straied out of the right way, and there is none which does good.
God himself and his Angels are the beholders of this assembly, and there is no
thought of any the assistantes, which is hid from him, that they should then
proceed roundly and soundly, and that the Bishops which are sent from Kings
and Princes should so furnishe their charges, that above all things they have
the reverence and honor of God before their eyes, without respect of hatred or
favor: for considering the assembly is held to establish peace, they must
cast far from them all contention and partialitye. The Oration finished, the
decree of the Synod was read by John Fonseca B. of Castrimare, a Spaniard, by
which all Christians were admonished to amend their lives, fear God, often
confess themselves, and often visit the Monasteries of Saints, Decree of the
Council of Trent.
that they should pray to God for a public peace; that the Bishops and other
Priests should be attentive to prayers, and say Mass at the least every
Sunday, praying for the Pope, Emperor, and whole Christendom: that they
likewise exercise themselves in fasting and doing of alms in the great Temple;
that every Thursday in the week they say a Mass of the holy Ghost, and during
the saying thereof, that all be attentive to the Priest, especially in time of
the Sacrifice, and that they keep themselves from chatting; that the Bishops
live soberly, taking away all superfluity of their tables, shunning all idle
and light discourse, that they accustom their people to like discipline, in
sort that they show themselves honest in words, apparel, and whatsoever they
shall do. And for so much as the end of the Council is to endeavor that the
darkness of errors and heresies, which since a good while have reigned upon the
earth, being chased away, the light of the truth may shine forth; all are
admonished, and especially men of knowledge, carefully to advise by what means
this may be brought to pass, in delivering of their opinions that they follow
the decree of the Council of Toledo, and do all things modestlye without
cries, nor be riotous or obstinate, but pronounce all sweetly and leasurely.
The other Session was the fourth of Februarye, where nothing was dispatched nor
resolved, save only that they confessed the Creed of the faith, and put over
the other Session until the eight of April, by reason of such as were already
on their way, whom they thought good to attend, to the end the authority of the
decrees might be of greater weight.

differents which were between the Counts for their livings and inheritance, in
form of an amiable compounder and Arbitrator. And albeit they desired they
might bury him in their Country, yet the Elector of Saxe would needs have him
brought to Witemberg. He left of a Nun which he married 1505. John, Martin,
and Paul, his children, which have not followed any course, either for the
diminishing or increase of his reputation.

Hereupon to confirm the suspicions which many had of a war at hand for
Religion in Germany, were seen the first effects in the holy League of the
Imperialles, and that of the Protestants made and renewed at Smalcade as I have
declared unto you.

succor from them, at the least not to favor the enemies of the common
Country, and of Christian Religion, giving them to understand, after he had
made them see what his duty and affection was to the good of the common wealth
of Germany, how this war was not prepared against the Cities, but against
certain rebels, which had committed treason, who had confronted the authority
of the Emperor, pilled the goods of Princes and of the Church, and would in

rather to order them by justice, then by arms to ruin all Germany,
considering that all differents between an Emperor and the Princes ought to
be adjudged by the Empire. Now as the Landgraue, being called for by him, had
in familiar speech at Ratisbone (where the continuance of the Colloquie was
assigned) told him that his companions had been advertised from all parts,

how he meant clean to run over those of the confession of Ausbourg, how he
attended succors from the K. of France, and how he had made truce for one
year with the turk, by means of the French, and that this council had been
begun by the Pope, to the end the decrees made against them might be put in
execution, notwithstanding that they had yielded him succor against the Turk
and King of France, and that as well at Spire as at Ratisbone he had assured
the^ of a firm peace, albeit they could not accord of religion, he answered
that he never thought it, praying them not to believe such reports: that he
had made peace with the French, it was all, and truce with the Turk to make
poor Germany take so much more breath, to the end that during this truce they
might make ready to ouerrunne the Turk, when it should be extermined
considering cheefely that they above all, had so oftentimes lamented the misery
of Germany: but that the council held to determine the matter of Religion as
they had so often required. And after that the Landgraue had replied, that
there could be no good concluded for them, considering the Pope their mortal
enemy commanded there, and that even the Monks called again there in doubt
the articles accorded, that they were promised a free and sure on in Germany,
together with the reformation of the Imperial chamber so bitter against them,
and that hardlye they could send their Doctors, much less come themselves to
Ratisbone as the Emperor desired, for the reasons which he alleged, he
retired himself into his Country, and anon after their Deputies at Worms
having intelligence of this communication, slunk away the 23. of April, the 8.
whereof the fathers concluded upon certain points, but of the general sort
and least controversied in the Church. In sum the holy league was set down
in writing, and after the 26. of June 1546. proclaimed, by which the Pope

other Princes.
Crowns at Venice, over and above one hundred thousand already given, and
furnished twelve thousand Italian Fantassins and 500. Horse, paid for six
months, permitting unto the Emperor to take for that year the moitie of the
reuenew of the churchmen in Spain, and to sell as much of the yearelye rents of
the Monasteries of Spain, as amounted unto five hundred thousand Crowns, so
as he employed them only in this war: upon condition that he should morgage
as much of his own demaine, for which he should make assurance, to the Popes
good liking. Upon this Vlrich of Witemberg, and the Cities of high Germany
were first in arms against the Emperor, after the Princes joined themselves,
the Elector Palatine standing neutrall, prayed them to submit themselves, and
demand pardon of the Emperor. They, the Emperor, and Pope, entreated the
Zuizers to stand Neutrall. The Protestants sought succors of the K. of France
and England. Now the Emperor sought to hide his game, until his forces might
be in readiness, namely, the Italians which were to pass the Alps, where the
passages are easy to be kept, for there are but two to go into Germany, from
Trent to Enipont. To go from thence into Bauiere where the Emperor was,
stood at the parting of the Mountains, Ereberge, a forte almost impregnable,

had not the subjects of K. Ferdinand risen. So the Italians came under
Octauian Farneze Cardinal, with many renowned Captains: Cosme of Medices
joined thereto 200. Horse of ordinance: Hercules Duke of Ferarra 100. under
Alphonso his base brother: the 20. of July the Emperor bannished the Saxon and
Landgraue by his letters Pattents, in which he declared the reason at large,
as perjured persons, rebels, seditious, guilty of treason, and disturbers of
the public tranquillity, whom he determined to chastise according to their
deserte, withal those that should take their part. And the 12. of August the
Protestants sent him letters of defiance, naming him but Charles pretending
himself Emperor. Upon this the Emperor sent the first of August the copy of
their banishment to Maurice, who having talked very familiarly with the
Emperor, went home, and thence to Prague toward Ferdinande. Now for that he
was near kinseman to the bannished, in sort that he might pretend some right
to their goods, he commanded him and his brother Augustus to sease thereon,
otherwse it should be to the first occupier: in sort that the right of
consanguinitie and contracts should nothing at al serve his turn, joined
withal that he should be comprehended under the same pain, as having been
disobedient unto him: and commanded the Nobility, and people to fulfill his
commandment.

The two armies being encamped before Ingolstat upon the Danube, The
Protestants fault and error.
the Protestants were the stronger in number of horse and artillery, but the
Emperor had more Fantassins, Lords, and Captains of Mark. In sum, the
Protestants lost there a fair occasion, to have broken the Emperor, who yet
had not his camp well entrenched, nor the succor of ten thousand Fantassins,
and four thousand Horse, which the Count de Bure brought unto him, they also
lost the time at Nerlinge, so as the Emperor being seized of the places
bordring of Danube, and having it so at his devotion, as he could cause all
sort of victual to be brought, pursued them then with great advantage: for
they ill husbanding the opportunities which presented themselves, and adding
thereunto that they were two heads equal, and banded in their opinions,
Schertelin first, afterward other, retired themselves from them. Maurice in
the mean time had prayed his Cousin the D. of Saxe by his Father in law the
Landgraue, to take in good part that he seized of his living, but perceiving
himself refused, joined with Ferdinande, who to enforce the Bohemians to
ouerrunne Saxe, (utterly refusing it, considering the alliance which they had
made with that house, and for that they verilye thought he had wrong done
him) caused his cauallerie of Hussaries of Hungaries to come down, and some
Silesians, Maurice warreth against his cousin and the Protestants.
with whom he put all Saxe to fire and sword: Maurice ever saying, that he
had rather sease thereof himself then a stranger should, considering that the
mines of silver were common to him with his cousin, and that his lands were
shut in within the others, which he made sure by this means: besides that
he did nothing but by the advice of the estates, who had written to that end
to his Cousin: and further that the Emperor had sworn unto him, that he meant
no harm but to the Rebels, and not to Religion: wherefore in all cases the
faith excepted, one ought to obey that Magistrate, which suffered in his
Country the exercise of religion; and so determined to pursue his own right,
and the differentes which so long time he had had with the Elector, fearing
least his lands should fall into the hands of Strangers: offering when he
should be reconciled to the Emperor and Ferdinand, that he would restore up al
unto him, whereof he certified his Cousin and his Son, so as the Hungarians
following of him, he took all the places except Gothe-aenac and Witemberge,
binding all the subjects to sweat unto him. For which he was misliked by every
man, rendering so poor a recompense unto him, whom he ought to have held for a
father, and author of all his good. He was son to Henry, whose brother
George Duke of Saxe, had ordained by his testament, that the Emperor should
enjoy his province until that his brother had renounced the Protestant
Religion: But the Elector and Landgraue hindered it, making his testament to be
broken, and took Henry and his children into their league. Moreover whreas
George had given unto him a pension in money, and that they feared for spite of
Religion he would refuse to pay it, the Protestants promised him in case it
should so fall out, to furnish the sum unto him themselves, so the Saxon
being called on that side, and seeing the Landgraue (having left unto him his
people) retire himself, and that the Allies furnished no more supplies, he
went aganst Maurice, out of whose hands in the end he got again all the
places, and took a number of his people, and whatsoever Ferdinand had taken
from him, shutting both them into Bohemia, he subjected to himself also the
Bishoppricke of Magdeburg, and Halbestat, having conuented with John Albert the
Bishop. The Emperor in the mean time triumphed thoroughout Germany,
ordayning and imposing great ransomes to all the Princes, and Protestant Cities,
even to the Elector Palatine, who before as a Neutre, was ready to have
reformed his Churches by Paul Faggius, had not this accident fallen out, and
was feign to have pardon of the Emperor for the 400. horse which he had sent
to the Protestants: albeit he protested that it was not meant against him, but
by right of Obligation, carried by a particular contract with the Duke of
Witemberg. Whom likewise, and his son Christopher he pardoned, but would
not his brother George, all renouncing the Leage, and not speaking of Religion.

Afterward the Emperor pursuing of the Saxon, the 22. of April 1547. arrived
at Misnes which Frederic had quit, and burning the wooden bridge, encamped
himself at Mulburge near the river of Albye; the Emperor still hastening for
fear he should enclose himself within Witemberg. So as with a thousand
Spanish Harquebusiers, which waded into the water, to pass forward, he
assailed the guard on the other shore notwithstanding the Cannon shot, which
showred down on every side. Afterward with the small Boats which Frederic
had abandoned, he made a bridge, over which the Hungarians of Ferdinand and
the light horse passed first, followed with the rest, hastening to follow
Frederic, who was reencountred 3. leagues from Albye, near the forest
Lochane, where he charged him so hard, that after a long combat, he was
defeated, hurt, taken and brought by the Duke of Alua unto him, The Elector
hurt taken and brought to the Emperor.
to whom having said, I render my self thy prisonner, most merciful
Emperor; and pray thee to give me entertainment worthy of a Prince, he
answered. Now then thou do acknowledge me an Emperor, but I will handle thee
according to thy desert. Shortly after being condemned to death, the Elector of
Brandebourge so much appeased the Emperor, that he had his life, not refusing
any conditions offered unto him, saving to obey the Emperors ordinances or the
Council, choosing rather to die. It was then ordained that the Emperor should
confiscate all his goods, which he gave to Ferdinand and Maurice, upon
condition that Maurice should yearly pay unto the Saxon and his children
fifty thousand crowns. If it so seemed good to the Emperor and Maurice, he
should enjoy Got, so as he raised the Castle and fortefied not the Town. And
for that he was much in debt, Maurice should give unto his children one
hundred thousand crowns, to be employed to the payment of his debtes grown
before the league of Smalcade: and that Maurice should discharge all such debts
as his lands, which had been confiscat, and given unto him by the Emperor
were liable unto: And so all suites to be had at an end, and his children to
have the vsufruite of the goods mentioned, if they approved these conditions,
and the people likewise. And in respect his life was saved, he should for ever
after remain prisoner to the Emperor, and to his son the Prince of Spain.
He surrendered likewise his right and dignity of Elector into the hands of
the Emperor, who put Maurice as well in possession of the dignity as lands of
Frederic. And by his decree it was ordained, that if the other should chance
to dye without heirs masles, Augustus his brother and his children should be
in remainder thereunto, which was done the 24. of February 1548. at
Witemberge. Frederic regarding the ceremonies of his house all the Electors
present, the Landgraue under suertie of Brandebourge, Maurice, and Volfange his
sons in law, rendered himself almost to the discretion of the Emperor, who
afterward proposed a league at Vlme, to appease all such troubles as might
ensue either for Religion or otherwise: But the whole was referred to
Ausbourge. Hereupon the Landgraue having demanded, and received pardon, and
promise that he should not remain prisoner, was stayed and commanded to
follow the Emperor, after that he had accomplished all the rest of the
conditions. Great ransomes which the Emperor had of the Germans.
For which Maurice and Brandebourge, being his suerties for his liberty grew
in great rage; so as the Emperor to defraye the expense of his war got, what
with these ransomes, and otherwise among the Catholics, and Lutherans above
sixtene hundred thousand crowns, and well five hundred pieces of Artillery,
which he sent into Spain, Naples, Milan, and the low country.

The Emperor after these victories assigned a day first at Vlme, The Emperor
would have the Council removed from Bolonia to Treat.
then at Ausbourg to accord points in Religion, reform the Justice of the
chamber, and obey the Council. The Palatin, Maurice, and Brandebourge would
not consent to any but in place free and sure. In the end, that thereby they
might the sooner get the Landgraue out of prison they accorded one, and by
their example, the more resolute Cities, by writing granted somewhat of their
demand: So as the Emperor being very joyful thereof, made great instance
toward the Pope, that he would remove the Council to Trent from Bologne
where he had appointed it to be held 1544. in respect of the vnholsomnes of the
air said Hierosme Fracastor who monthly had a great pension from him. And upon
the difficulty which the Pope made therein, he sent Mendoza to protest of his
part before the Pope, and the rest of Bologne, that he held of no account
whatsoever should be there concluded: declaring that he would provide thereto
well enough, by a lawful convocation of the estates of Germany, 1548 which
were of his very opinion being assembled at Ausbourge. And further for that he
would not have the Council to be clean in despair of being held, the
delaying thereof so much importing him, when as power was given unto him to
choose the Collocutors, Judges, and witnesses, he took Iules Flug Bishop of
Numbourg, Michael of Sidoine, John Alebe Agricola, who 18. years before had
been a Lutheran, Melancthon, and Brence, who very secretly wrote a Book of
Religion, and after they had again perused and corrected it, presented it unto
him: But Bucer finding many things contained therein, refused to sign it,
saying that the Popes doctrine was there manifestly confirmed, and since that
in like sort they added sundry other things: So as both the Pope and
Protestants allowed of it, albeit small reformation was had therein of any such
Articles as were generally received of the Catholics. Romee general of the
Iacobins wrote against it at Rome, and so did Robert Bishop of Auranches in
France, for that this book permitted marriage to Priests, and the Supper
under both kinds. The Emperor notwithstanding pressed the estates hard to
stick fast unto it, and not to innouate any thing either in their preachings
or writings to the contrary, attending the decree of a Council. Afterward
the fiftenth of May the Archbishop of Mayence chief of the Electors, thanked
him for his so great care of the public, in the name of them all, and said
that all ought to obey his decree: The which he accounted as a common
approbation, and would not for ever after admit of any other reason or excuse
to the contrary, whosoever would say that they had not consented thereunto: In
sort that he caused it to be imprinted both in the Latin, and vulgar German
tongs. Four days after he besought the estates to contribute by head, toward
the remedying of such inconveniences, as either for Religion or otherwise might
fall out in the common wealth, and that the money might be reserved as a
public treasor in some places fittest for that purpose, to have succors
ready at need: and Ferdinand required as much to relieve him against the
Turk the five years of truce being expired. Afterward the Emperor somewhat
and superficially reformed the state of the Church about the end of June 1548.
and caused a Book to be imprinted: Maurice departing from Ausbourge about the
end of 1548. went into his own country, where his estates urging him with his
promise to maintain among them the pure confession of Ausbourge, in the end
he caused to be made a form of Religion which all ought to hold: from whence
great Scandale arose. All the Princes and Cities except Breme, and Magdebourge
consented to the decree of Ausbourge, an occasion that the latter was by the
Emperor exposed as a pray to all such as would war upon him in the year
1549. Now as this decree of Ausbourge was already as it were generally
received throughout all Germany, so greatly did the victory and Spanish
Garrisons of the Emperor, together with the Saxons and Landgraues
imprisonment, astonish the people, at such time especially when there was an
apparent change of Religion thoroughout all the countries of Maurice, the
ministers of the Churches of Lubec, Lunebourg, and Hambourge confuted well at
length the Book and decree of Ausbourge, by another contrary, which they
caused to be put in printe, whereof John Epin was the principal author.
Shortly after the Doctors of Magdebourge, Nicholas Amstroff, and above all
Mathias Flaccius an Illiricque, borne in the City of Albonne, who since was
one of the principal authors of the Ecclesiastical history of Magdebourge,
and Nicolas Le Cocq opposed themselves stoutly against them of Witemberge and
Lipsa, and condemned them in sundry printed Books as dissemblers, over
simple, to timorous, and by indifferent and mean things how they had made a
high way to the papisticall Religion: the which at the first proceeding from a
good beginning, grew in simplicity, afterward suffered it self to corrupt
thorough a disordinate license of such things among the Christians of the
primitive Church: who overcome by little and little, with to great a fear of
displeasing, and roundly resisting such as at the first would bring in their
fantasies for sure rules of Faith, in the end clean marred, under a Mask of
things indifferent and such like human traditions, the true and pure word of
God. For conclusion they set down this rule, that all ceremonies and fashions,
how indifferent soever they may be of themselves, are no more near at this
present, considering that the virtue, opinion and necessity of service is now
annexed thereunto, and that the occasion of impiety is yielded thereby.
Illiricque one of the authors of this learned and laborious Ecclesiastical
history, had been certain years an Auditor and Disciple of Melancthon: but
in this different, retired himself to Magdebourge: and caused a Book to be
imprinted wherein he rendered the reason of his act. They of Hambrough wrote
likewise to them of Witemberg, and especially to Phillip Melancthon, making a
Catalogue of such things as they termed Neuter, or indifferent, and setting
down what might be received, and together prayed them to write openly of
their side, what they would have comprehended under that name, to the end men
might agree on somewhat, and follow it without varying. And for fear least the
name of Neutralitie might give occasion to sundry other errors, which by little
and little might be engraued in the brains of men, Melancthon, a man sweet;
fearful, Melancthons answer
and a great enemy to all ryots, answered among other things that some
servitude might well be borne, provided that it were without any impiety.

Now not to long to leave behind, the persecution of the Catholics against
the Lutherans in the Realm of France, Persecution of Lutherans.
K. Henry seeing at Paris the 19 of November 1549. the Edicts of his father
very evil executed by the negligence of the Ecclesiastical Judges which was
complained of unto him (co^tending with the sovereign courts and other Judges
of their natural jurisdictions and powers) ordained the better to conform
himself to the title of Thrise-Christian: that the Royal judges should take
knowledge, jointly of the said faults as the cases should offer themselves: as
touching the information and decree only, after having well executed the
decree, and examined the accused, they should deliver the^ up to the Church, to
judge of the errors, or simple heresy, in case it proceeded rather of
ignorance, error, and human frailty, lightness and britlenes of the tongue of
the accused, then of mere malice or will to cut himself off from the union of
the Church: and in case together with heresy were found any public scandal
popular commotion, sedition, or other crime importing any public offense and
consequently in case priueledged, then to be tired by the Royal Judges, and of
the Church together. And after the common fault shall be judged by the Church
the^ the case priueledged shall be judged by the Royal, charging that any appeal
made from the sentence should be brought into Parliament. And for that the Judge
Ecclesiastical had not the seasure of men's persons out of their Pretoire, for
the aid which the one Justice ought unto the other, it was now given by
privilege unto him, and as far as should please him, that in this crime only
he might cause, under his authority, by their seargeants, to be put in
execution the decrees of such arest of bodies as should be judged by the^,
without asking any permission of any secular Judges, for fear that in
delaying, the accused might be advertised thereof, and so escape, and if the
ecclesiastical judge stood in need of any aid; it was enjoined to all officers
Royal to execute the Ecclesiastical decrees, without taking any knowledge of
the cause. And in case the accused, or any such as it should be decreed
against, should absent themselves, it was ordained that the Judge Royal,
within three days should proceed against them by seasure of their goods,
that the accused should be delivered up to the judge of the Church, to be
proceeded against as above said. Afterward upon the engrosing of this Edict
in Parliament at Paris the twenty nine of November, the Court ordained at the
request of the Proctor general, that upon the plight should be set down at
the charge, that the Judge Ecclesiastical shall not condemn any man, for crime
of heresy, be he lay or Clarke, in any pecuniarie fine: and further that when
in crime of heresy he shall have given any judgment, either of perpetual
prison, or otherwise he shall no more in the end of the condemnation use
these accustomed words, Salua misericordia Domini: And that forbidding should
be made as well of the one, as the other. And for that the King perceived how
slowly enough they proceeded to the execution of this Edict, the greater part
of the Royal judges not so forward in favoring the Ecclesiastical as they
desired, to be meet therewith he was councelled to send his commandment to
the Parliament of Paris from Fountainbleau the 9. of February 1549. willing
them to appoint commissioners out of their body, to make the inditements of
such as stood evil affected to the faith, in case the Presidiall, or
otherwise the Royal Judges should be negligent, who should pay the expenses
of such appointed deputies.

Diet of Ausbourge.
Hereupon the 27. of July the Emperor began the day of Ausbourge, proposing
there to continue the Council, to keep the last decree of Ausbourg, to punish
the rebels, and restore the jurisdiction and goods of the Church. But Maurice
declared by his Ambassadors, as it were alone against all the rest, that he
could not avow the council except all begun a fresh, and that the Divines of
the confession of Ausbourg might bother hard, with power to decide the matters,
that the Pope should not sit as chief, but submit himself to the Council,
that he should absolve all Bishops of their oath made unto him, to the end they
might freely deliver their mind. But it was not permitted that this
declaration should be registered. In the mean time George D. of Megelbourg with
a maine army wasted the country of Magdebourg, against whom the inhabitants and
soldiers issued forth. But having in the hinder part of his army placed all
the Merchants and Villagers, for that the best were in the fore front, they
defeated the^, took the Artillery, Baggage, and sundry of the inhabitants.
This done, as they entertained notwithstanding Maurice in all duty, the Elector
of Brandebourg, Albert his cossen, Henry of Brunsuich, and sundry other
addressed troops the better to shut the^ in. But salied forth upon them
conducted by certain Gentlemen, Captains and soldiers, who in dispite of
Brunsuich were retired thither, and carried themselves so fortunately, as they
took their George of Megelbourg author of all. After Maurice was declared
chief of the army by the Emperor and the estates, with intent to block the^
in, ordaining one hundred thousand crowns for the expenses past, and
threescore thousand for every month to come. Upon the displeasure in the mean
time which the Emperor conceived for that the decree of Ausbourg was not
practiced, the Protestants said that they could not so soon root out the
Religion, which had so long time grown old in the hearts of men and the
Catholics laid the fault upon the Priests, negligence of Magistrates, and
wickedness of the Lutheran ministers, so as nothing could be resolved of, but
all referred to the Council. Hereupon Pope July assigned the Council at Trent
the first of May 1550 by his Bull which he sent unto the Emperor. Now as the
Emperor departing out of his country to come to Ausbourg, had left the
Landgraue at Malines, Maurice and Brandebourg made earnest instance for his
delivery: but it was answered that not only he, but also his children and
Counselors had so be haued themselves, that he might not as yeat be
delivered. The Guard likewise told him that he was to be carried into Spain:
which made him seek aid of his children, to whom setting before their eyes
the fidelity wherewith they were tied unto him, he gave in charge, that they
should cite Maurice to appear according to the tenor of his obligation, which
they did, and cited their friends many times most instantly. But they now
together, now apart, one while by messengers, an other while in person, showed
that it would neither turn to their profit nor their Father to run to work
so headily. And from time to time alleged new reasons, whereby they hoped that
he might be delivered without any danger, they prayed them then to take
patience, and demanded respite. The Emperor who had already solicited the
Landgraue, by De La Lare, to deliver up into his hands the letters of
Obligation, seeing himself again importuned for his deliverance, sent Lazarus
Schuende to his Children and Counselors, commanding them not only hence
forward to take heed they pressed no more Maurice and Brandebourge, but also
to send unto him all the letters and renounce any more the following thereof.
If they failed therein, he threatened the^ that they should well abide the burden
of it. And yet for all that he prevailed not, he declared in like sort al such
Princes as were bound quit, and absolved of their promises: The Landgraue then
seeing not any hope left, determined to make an escape if it were possible for
him; upon which he sundry times consulted with his people which he caused to
come from Hesse: But fearing the danger, they were very slack, in the end he
made Conrad Bredesten, and John Romelia, undertake the matter, who from his
own country as far as Malines laid post horses, upon which he might escape.
But the matter came out by one of his own servants, who in great friendship
had told one at Malines, The Landgraue discovered minding to have made an
escape.
that within a few hours he should be at liberty, for being come from hand to
hand to the captain of the Gards ears, even upon the pinch that he was ready
to take his heels, the matter burst out and two of his servants slain in the
place, the rest taken and beheaded, and him self clapped into a more close
prison. Whereof the Emperor being advertised, he took it maruelously at the
heart, and wrote to Maurice and Brandebourg that this so audatious an enterprise
turned to his dishonor, being resolved rigorously to punish those which had
either Council or assisted him therein. They sent the Copy of these letters to
Guilleaume du Lantgraue, telling him among other matters, that if he would any
more attempt the like, they would in naught be bound unto him: Maurice
notwithstanding conforted him apart, promising for the deliverance of their
father not only al his substance, but also to adventure his own life, assuring
him that at such time as commodity should present it self, he would represent
himself in Justice, when as matters should be so settled as they should have very
small cause to care for the mislike of any. Which made many to surmise that at
that time he practiced some league with the French.

Maximilian of Austria son in law to the Emperor, Difference about succession
in the empire.
and chosen in his absence K. of Bohemia came at this time from out of Spain
to Ausbourg, called thither by Ferdinand his father, for the different which he
had with his brother the Emperor, as touching the succession of the empire. For
the deciding whereof the Emperor had caused his sister Mary to return
thither, who was parted from him in the month of September: for knowing how
material the annexing of Germany was unto himself, he desired there to ensure
and establish the seat of his son, who ought to rule over so sundry, and
separate provinces. Ferdinand who tended to the same end, was as well resolved,
not to frustrate the attempt or profit thereof, were it either for himself,
or his children. Now Maximilian was of so mild a nature, and understood so
many tongues, and singularly the German, endued besides with such a courtesy
in his manner of life, that he was not only agreeable unto all the people, but
his virtues procured unto him such good hap, and advancement, as I shall in
place hereafter declare unto you.

For the better assistance of this council whether the Emperor had given
assurance to the Protestants to come in safety, they chose these divines,
Melancthon for Sax, Council.
Bucer for Witemberg, united in opinion, and approved by the^ of Strasbourg:
and after agreed upon such points as were to be there proposed, for all this
Maurice to gain time, spy his opportunity, and enforce the Emperor to deliver
and set at liberty his father in law, trayning the siege of Magdebourg in
length, wrote back unto him, that for his part he stood very well contented,
with that faith which he had given unto him, Maurice demands a more
safeconduct.
and could require very little more. But for so much as he was informed, that
there stood in force a decree made by the council of Constance, by which it was
ordained that informatio^ should be made against al heretics or any suspected
of heresy, if perchance any sommoned to a council should appear there, and
that sentence should be there pronounced against the^, albeit that the Emperor
should give the^ his faith and safe conduct, he desired a sufficienter
assurance, for says he this decree remains ingrosed, and they right well put
it in practice, The Catholics held that faith was not to be holden with

in putting John Hus to death. Who barely relying upon the faith, and safe
conduct which the Emperor Sigismond gave him, went thither, the matter being
the^ thus, could not by any menes send any of his own people to Trent except
the Prelates which were there did in like sort give their faith, in the name of
the whole Council, as it was done at the Council of Basle, which
incontinently followed that of Constance, for the Bohemians having been made
wise by that which was before done, would by no means come to Basle but under
a safe conduct from the whole Council, he required then that by virtue of his
authority and credit, he would cause them to do as much, otherwise if they
did not give safe conduct in like manner as had been before given at Basle, he
protested, that it ought not to turn to any matter of consequent, either to
himself, or any of like Religion, if they sent no man thither I have above
spoken of John Hus, of the Council of Constance, and of the war which the
Bohemians made against the Churchmen for such co^demnations. Now for that
there was a decree made at Constance, that the first Council should be held
five years after, the other 7. and then from ten years, to ten years, the
fathers assembled together again at Basle: and for so much as the Bohemians
had not as then been reconciled, Safe conduct from the counsel at Basle for
the Bohemians.
pursuit was made against them by letters and messages, so as in the City of
Egre, there was a form of safe conduct set down in writing, the Bohemians
saying that they would not make any difficulty at all to appear at the
Council, provided that the fathers would agree to that: after that they which
had been sent in Embassage had made report, of that which they had done, the
fathers approved it and dispatched away the like safe conduct sealed, and by
the most loving letters exhorted them to make themselves ready, so as, when the
safe conduct of the Emperor Sigismond should be in like sort sent unto them,
they might presently set forwards on their journey. This was during the four
Session, in the year of grace 1432. Maurice then being thereof advertised by
his people, solicited the Emperor, and earnestly insisted upon the ordinance
of Basle, both as being the last, and most convenient for that time. For the
case now of the Protestants, and then of the Bohemians was almost alike. And
the Council published at Trent for the like causes in effect, as it was at
Basle: to wit, to root out heresies, to restore the peace and tranquillity of
the common wealth, and for the amendment of the Church, all vices being
utterly secluded.

The Emperor in the mean time, changed the estates of the Cities of Germany
alongest as he passed by, as at Ausbourg where he altered the Senate, and
reformed all at his pleasure. Afterward retired into Flanders, he sent Henry
Hase 1551. al along the Suaube appointing new Counselors, and deposing all
such Preachers and ministers as would not obey the decree of Ausbourg. In the
mean time Magdebourg was continually battered and rudely entreated, but after
many skirmishes reciprocal between the army of Maurice, and those which
were besieged in Magdebourge for one whole year together, Magdebourg delivered
up.
the 3. of November 1551. Hedec being sent from Maurice came to Magdebourg,
where having caused the Captains to come forth into the next forte, he agreed
of all things, and there passed letters signed and sealed: Pasport was granted
to the men of war to depart in safety, but as soon as they were cassirde,
they were secretly entertained again and enroled, under the charge of
Megelbourg, who by accord had been set at liberty; for Maurice to good
purpose, would by no means have his own name come in question. The conditions
of peace were these that they should beseech pardon of the Emperor, attempt
nothing against the house of Austria and of Burgundy: submit themselves to the
chamber; obey the last decree of Ausbourg; represent themselves in justice at
the request of any which would bring action against them; raise the
fortifications of their City at the Emperors pleasure; receive Garrison at al
times pay 150 thousand crowns to the public treasor, delivered to the emperor
12 great pieces of Artillery toward the charges of his war and release the
Duke of Megelbourg, and all the rest of the prisoners. The same very day that
those which had been besiedged went out, which were 2000 Pietons and 130
horse, Maurice caused five ensigns of Fanterie to enter in, and the next
morning himself entered the City with his Cauallery. The Senate went out to
meet him, to whom he caused an oath to be ministered to become true to the
Emperor, the empire and himself, afterward having left a sufficient Garrison,
he caused all the rest to void. That done he sent for the preachers, and
greatly complained by his Counselors Facius, Calebric, and Mortise, of the
injury which they had done unto him, in little Books, and Pictures imprinted
by them, as if he had been one revolted from the Doctrine of the Gospel, and
had made war against the City for their constant profession of the truth.
Wherefore he said, he had just cause to be revenged of them if he would follow
his own affections, but he quitted all to the common wealth. Requiring from
thence forward that they should exhort the people to amendment of life, and to
bear reverence to the Magistrate, he commanded also that they should make
public prayers for the Emperor, for himself, and for all other Magistrates.
He said further that the Council was then held at Trent, to which he would
present a confession of the true doctrine, as well in his own name as of all the rest of the Princes and estates, that they should pray to God then to
prosper the enterprise, and take heed hereafter from proceeding in like
injuries as they had accustomed. The ministers after having consulted together
answered, that it was not they themselves which had published those Pictures,
and yeat they could not esteem them worthy of any reprehensio^, for that it
was not to be denied, but since three years last past many of his Country
were revolted from the pure doctrine; besides that it was an easy matter to
prove how the City had been besieged for the Gospels sake, if they would
only regard but who were the first authors of the war; that they had ever
done their duty in admonishing of the people, which they would in like sort
do ever after: as touching the Council which was assembled to deface the
truth, and in which the Pope was as chief, that was not lawful for them to
make any other prayer unto God, then that it would please him to break in
sunder, bruise, and scatter their devises and imaginations, for naught could
they else attend from thence then all my mischief. The Articles of composition
were then published. But it is certain that they were put in good assurance of
their liberty and Religion: Besides that Maurice chose rather, that the town
should be yielded to him then to the Emperor, as the issue afterward declared.
Now the end of the miseries of Magdebourg, was the beginning of a war to the^,
who had been the authors of their afflictions as we will tell you. In the mean
while that Maurice remained in the town, he sufficiently open himself, and
gave out that it should cost him his life, but he would set his father in law at
liberty: yea so far as the next morning he did not stick to tell it franckly
to one which was talking with him. He had before sent his Ambassadors to the
Emperor, for the delivery of the Landgraue, having associated unto him the K.
of Denmark, and sundry Princes of Germany as we will show you, being resolved
to proceed therein by force, if he could not otherwise obtain it besides that
he had already made a covenant with the K. of France, Embassage from the king
of France to Maurice.
who had secretly sent thither John de Fersne B. of Bayonne. Who having a long
time negotiated in Germany had good understanding of the tongue. But it seemed,
that the Emperor made very small accounte of all these matters, and dreamed of
nothing else then the war of Parma, and Council of Trent.

Hereupon the children of the Landgraue wrote again to the Emperor for the
delivery of their father, whereof they would feign see an end. Who in the
beginning of November 1551. was gone as far as Enipont, as well at the request
of the Prelates to favor the holding of the Council, as the better to provide
for the war of Perma between him and the King of France, to which he seemed
so wedded as persuading himself that the King would not undertake any other
matter, he scarce believed the preparatiues of war which were said to be
made in Germany. Then the Ambassadors of these two Princes, being come in the
beginning of December, after having most humblye saluted the Emperor in the
name of their masters, spoake in this sort. Maurice and Brandebourg
Ambassadors speech.
You know most merciful Emperor, in what pain remain at this day the most
excellent Princes Electors Maurice and Brandebourge for the detaining in hold
of the Landgraue, a matter happening unto them beyond all expectation, such
time, as thorough a singular affection which they carried unto you, by reason
whereof they were desirous to prepare unto you the way to an easy and notable
victory, they sought naught else then to ease you of a great charge by a long
war, and restore the Country to peace and tranquillity. For which respect
they have so often been suitors unto you, as well in their proper person, as by
their Ambassadors, that it might please you to regard them, and release the
prisoner: your answer to their last Ambassador was, that you could not do it
until you saw the issue of the day prefixed to be held, besides that you made
no other promise, but that he should not always remain captive if he^ cpt the
accord: But for so much as they being busied about other affairs, have not
been able at the same day to be in person themselves, they again solicited
you at Ausbourge, by their Counselors and reiterated letters. In answer
whereof you wrote back unto them the reasons of your conceived displeasure
against him, pronouncing the Princes absolved of their obligation toward the
children of the Captive. Wherefore they determined to importune you in the like
again. And had come themselves in person, had it not been for what you know,
they were both of them employed in the war of Magdebourge, besides that
Brandebourg himself was sick, which was the cause that they have given us in
charge, to declare unto you for the first point. That when you did ordain that
the Landgraue should yield himself unto you upon condition, they understood
your intention by the B. of Arras, which was, that he should receive, and keep
such conditions, as you had proposed and imparted unto them. If it stood a
matter needful to persuade him to yield himself in such sort, it was as
needful to declare unto him that he should not be kept as a Captive, nor
worse dealt with then the treaty of peace contained. The Princes then were his
pledges, which your Councellers also well enough understood. And where as the
Landgraue still insisted, that they should declare unto him some Articles of
th'accord, and required that for the dispatch thereof he might not be stayed
above six days, it was granted unto him, after that the matter had been
proposed to the B. of Arras. As touching the rest of the points the Princes
obtained therein more then they demanded. And admit that in this proceeding
matters should not be a like understood of the one side, and the other, and
that the Landgraue being come was imprisoned against the faith promised, yeat
had the Princes never accused you for the same, had they not the same time,
having been graciously promised by your self, gone themselves in person to
Halle, and set him thence, at such time as the Landgraue approaching sent unto
them to come unto him to Numbourg. For at that time they spoake with you,
signifiyng unto you that they had persuaded him to stand to the conditions
proposed, and that he was not far off, yea that if it pleased you they would
go and meet him: In the mean time praying you that since he yielded
himself upon their faith and assurance, he might be charged no farther, to
which you condiscended. Now in the last dispatch, there was no mention at all
made either of prison or detention, as your own people the Bishop of Arras
and of Selde can very well witness. For the first had all the charge in this
matter, and sometimes called the other to assist him: for after that the
conditions were accepted of, and pardon demanded, the Princes stood fully
assured, that he should be incontinently released; which they had reason to
imagine for sundry causes. First, for that the Counselors never made once
mention of retaining him, which was a principal point in the treaty which the
Landgraue perceived, and considered of above all. Moreover, sundry things are
contained therein, which is not possible for any Prince captive to accomplish,
but for him only which is at liberty. After that he had besought you pardon,
you remitted his fault, and were contented to revoke his banishment, and give
him letters of reconciliation, besides that you received pledge and assurance,
wherein it was set down, that if he did not perform the accord, the people
should deliver him up unto you, and the pledges should by force of arms
constrain him to do his duty. All these things certes, had served to nothing,
and had been mere superfluous, if they had thought he should have endured
corporal punishment: but they imagining nothing less, considering especially
that the Counselors never made men^ion thereof, brought him upon this
assurance, promising to deliver him back again before his children, and to
endure like punishment that he should do, if any outrage were offered him. Such
was their intention, which was since more confirmed, when after great request
the Duke of Alua invited them to Supper at his house with the Landgraue. It was
not possible for them to conster in so ill a sense, this summons and
hospitalitye (considering the custom and fashion of the Princes of Germany)
that he should go into the D. of Alua his house, as into a prison: and that
they should go with him side by side, and bear him company thither, which had
they never so little made doubt of, who can imagine what they would have done?
for considering how they are Princes of Germany, and also Electors, issued from
right honorable familyes, never would they have been a means that a Prince of
an excellent house, both their allie and friend, should have been brought to
such a banquet to fall into so great troubles, and that they should lead him
as captive, and they were no whit at all made privy to the fact, until after
supper when the D. of Alua told him, that he must remain in the Castle as in
prison: howsoever the matter was, they went to work with a good meaning, as we
said in the beginning; and for so much as they have plighted their faith, you
may well perceive how hard and grievous a matter it will be both to them and
their children, if after having been often put in mind of their promises, and
after caution given, the Landgraue he detayned prisoner: you perceive likewise
(most puissant Emperor) you, who derive your race from the Germans,
(considering that the Children of the Captive Prince pursue their right, and
press the^ to redeliuer him unto them, according to the condition of the bond)
what becomes them to do according to the ancient custom of the Nobility of
Germany, for to preserve their honor and good reputation, and how they should
be inexcusable toward all the rest of the Princes, when the power of citing
should be taken from them, or the instrument of the bond, in such form as
remains in their hands, that if perchance the Landgraue who neither is
prisoner by faith given, nor by composition, but by occasion before specified,
through the grief and impatience of his so long restrainte, have sought some
means to escape, and that his men have attempted ought against the Guardes,
the Princes beseech that it may turn no ways to their damage: but for that by
reason of the obligation they are in so extreme distres, out of which you alone
after the immortal God, are able to deliver them, and that you are most
certain how they stand enwrapped in these inconveniences; besides that you
stand fully assured of their good affection, loyalty, and service, for that in
your adversities they neither have spared their goods, nor blood for your
profit, according to the example of their ancestors, they beseech you as much
as is possible, that you will succor them in delivering of the prisoner, and
that therein you weigh not so much the fact of the Landgraue, as their persons
who hold you in singular reverence, considering cheefelye that many of their
families have neither spared goods or lives for your ancestors, and for the
house of Austria and of Burgundy: and if perchance you fear that when he
shall be at liberty, he will break the accord, you do very well when the
matter shall proceed so far, but the Nobilitye and people of Hesse shall
promise the contrary unto you by oath, and as the Princes have made themselves
pledges, so if you desire any further assurance they have often offered it, and
do at this present, having given power unto us to do as much with you: as
touching such conditions as they have been able to accomplish, they do not
think that ought is left remaining; and when you shall know the cause for
which their fortes have not been so soon raised, they make no doubt but that
you will easily excuse and purge the children of the captive: if there rest any
other thing they will in every respect employ themselves to content you.
Therefore if they, their Fathers or Grandfathers, have ever done service to
your self, to the Emperor Maximilian, or any your ancestors, or if you think
that in time to come they may pleasure you in any occasion, they beseech you
affectionately that you suffer them to taste some fruit thereof, and that you
will cause them to see some effect of the hope and promise, which you gave them
first at Halle, secondly at Numbourg, and thirdly at Ausbourg: to the end in
time to come they may have the greater courage to honor you, being able to
glory in that the fidelity and service which they have done unto you, has been
by you acknowledged according to their deserte, if they be refused, you may
well think (excellent Emperor) what inconveniences will ensue, when they
shall be enforced to appear and approve their innocencye: but they hope well
that you will regard their prayers, which they will receive for a singular
benefit; and as well they, as the Landgraue with his children and alliance,
shall for ever endure all pain to acknowledge it. And for so much as this matter
touches so nearly their honor, they have solicited the rest of the Princes
to entreat with them, whose Ambassadors you see here present, to the end
that what themselves have not been able to obtain at your hands until this
present, either by prayers, messages, or letters, these here may obtain by
their credit and favor, beseeching you to take it in this part.

After that they had thus spoken, they presented unto him the letters of
Ferdinand K. of Romans, of Albert D. of Bauieres, of the Brethren of
Lunebourg written in the behalf of the Landgraue: those Princes which made
request by their Ambassadors, were the Elector Frederic Palatine, Wolfang de
deux pontz, John Marquess of Brandebourg, Henry, and John, Albert D. of
Megelbourg, Ernest Marquess of Bade, and Christophre D. of Witemberg, whose
Deputies after having showed their commission spoke in this manner.

The Princes Ambassadors.
The Electors Maurice and Brandebourg finding themselves greatly troubled for
the imprisonment of the Landgraue, and being minded to make request unto you
for him (most merciful Emperor) have required our Princes to join with them
in this their request, to the end it might be of greater weight and efficacy
on their behalf, which they could not deny unto them, in regard of that duty
of alliance, freendship, and conjunction which is between them. Considering
then that the matter stands on such terms, as the Ambassadors have at
length fully declared, and that if the captive be restrained any long time, it
may turn to the damage and blame of those which have pauned their faith, the
Princes which have sent us hither do beseech you, and carefully warn you to
weigh all these things, for they hold themselves greatly interessed if the
honor, dignity, and renown of them be not countergarded: a matter likelye to
ensue, if the Landgraue be not released. They require then most humblye that
these their requests may somewhat prevail with you, especially considering
that he has already acknowledged his fault, and besought pardon on both his
knees: that it is now a long time he has lien by it, and above all, in regard
that the extreme necessity of the two Electors demands it, who are fallen
into this inconvenience, for their proceeding herein in good faith, and their
willingness to do you service, that if peradventure there may have been some
fault committed, or that some matters have not been so well understood, yet it
is a matter honest and proper to your mercy, to prefer equity before the
rigor of law, and not so much to regard him which is captive, as the
inevitable necessity of the Electors, and to deal gently and liberally with
them, according to the example of your ancestors, who have always been
careful to preserve the honor of the Princes of the Empire: that will turn
to your great honor toward all men, and them especially. And it will breed
courage in them, to remain unto you singularly, faithful friends, and
affectionate servants, and to employ themselves in all things for the love of
you. The King of Denmark in like sort had sent his own Ambassador, who made
the like request.

The Emperor made answer certain days after, that the matter was of
importance, and required ripe deliberation, and for so much as he was
advertised that Maurice purposed to make his repair very shortly unto him for
other matters of consequence, in sort as having written unto him he attended
him daily, he would defer it until his coming, hoping that the matter might
then be entreated of most commodiously in his presence, for their parts they
might return again to their Princes, and tell them as from him, that he would
well carry in remembrance their demandes, and so guide himself in this action,
that they should well understand that their recommendation carried great weight
toward him.

Thus Maurice not able to pick any certainty out of all this, and causing
himself in the presence of many to be importuned by the Landgraues children,
who threatened to put both him and Brandebourg in suit for breach of promise,
had no sooner resolved with the Ambassador of France, (whose charge every man
was almost ignonorant of) of what succor he was to draw thence, then he
determined to make open war against the Emperor, but for all that, the
better to cover the fainednes of his intents, he sent his deputies to Trent, to
demand such another safeconduct as the Bohemians had at Constance, that the
Pope should submit himself unto the Council, and acquit the B. of their
oaths, Maurices demands at the council.
that all Nations might have free access thither, and that whatsoever had
been decreede before the coming of the divines should be cancelled. Srasbourg
and the D. of Witemberg his Ambassadors said as much. This coming of the
Ambassadors, and the promise which he made shortly after to be with the
Emperor, took away all suspicion of war, for the very Emperor wrote to the
Archbishops of Mayence, Treues, and Cologne, to leave Trent, and to go home
and defend their Countries from such soldiers as had been retained after the
siege of Magdebourg: and as the Emperor had in like sort prayed them to do,
they received very courteously: Maurice his deputies giving unto the^ their
safeconduct, saying that they had summoned thither all Nations, that all were
free there, but that reason and their duty would by no means permit them to
disanull or cancel ought, and much less to submit the Pope to the council.
The Ambassadors after having examined their safeconduct, found it different
from that of the Bohemians, and after that they had hastily read it over, they
found the principal articles changed, and the rest clean omitted: for in the
safeconduct which was given out to the Bohemians, there was among other
things, that they should have power to decide, that in all differents they
should take for judge the holy scripture, the practice of the ancient Church,
such councels and interpreters as agreed with the holy Scripture, that it
should be lawful for them to say divine service in their houses, in a tongue
which they understood, that nothing should be proffered in contempt and blame
of their doctrine, the first, third, and last of these points were clean
omitted, the second which is the principal, was altogether altered: this being
considered of according to the form of the decree of Basle, they prescribed
another safeconduct, and answered that it was not lawful for them to exceed
their commission, which carried that they were not to take any safeconduct, but
according to the contents of that at Basle. The Protestant deputies for the
causes before said would depart, Diversities of opinions in the Council of
Trent.
and also for that they were not able to endure the injurious preachings of
certain Monks against them and their religion, of which likewise they had not
free exercise in their own houses: besides the brute of the war which
hastened then as well as the rest of the Germans and Italians, who on the
other side suspected that the Prelates of Spain, Scicilie, Naples, and other
Imperialls, which demanded the continuance of the Council, would require a
reformation in the Popes authority, (whose Court they esteemed already
stretched to far) and in the discipline and manners of the Church, that the
superfluity, ambition, and example of their evil life, might be taken away,
that every man should take charge over his Church, and hold but one benefice,
to which sundry Germane catholics put to their helping hands, albeit
otherwise they did not acknowledge any error in the doctrine, and yet were of
opinion that Councels might err. In sum both they and the Italians (who they
say never greatly loved to hear of Councels) fearing that they would enter
into this consideration, trussed up their bag and baggage, as soon as they
had news of the taking of Ausbourg, which Maurice and his company took the
fourth day of April, three days after the siege, from the Emperors Garrison.
And albeit that the day of the Session was ordained to be the first of May, yet
altogether in despair, the Fathers which remained, assembled together the 20.
of April, The Council of Trent deferred for 2. years. Crescence Cardinal,
Legate and president for the Pope, died of an apprehension.
and proroged the council for two years, by reason of the discord happened
between the Kings and Princes, and for longer to, if in the mean time they
could not be reconciled. But the Legate Crescence President of the Council,
remained in his bed, frighted with a spirit which he saw by night, whereupon
shortly after he fell sick, imagining that he could never escape it, any
comfort that his friends or familiars could yield unto him: so he died at
Veronne. The Pope in the mean time had accorded with the K. of France, who
prepared himself against the Emperor, as I will tell you.

You have seen the siege of Magdebourg, and what Maurice did for the deliuerye
of the Landgraue, who perceiving the Emperor, fed him with nothing but hopes,
practiced as many Princes, Captains, and other, as he was able in Germany, to
maintain the liberty of Religion, and the common wealth. After that he made
an alliance with the K. of France, and gave hostages on the one side and the
other: and the^ they caused the occasions of the war to be imprinted and
spread abroad, to draw the more unto them. In the mean season the emperor caused
the Drum to be struck up at the foot of the Mountains, and assembled his men
of war at the town of Rutte, as the most commodious Rende-uous for all his
troops.

The birth of H. 3. K. of France and Pologne.
Upon the 21. of September 1551. Queen Catherine of Medices was brought a bed
at Fontaine-bleau, of a Son, named Edward Alexander D. of Angoulesme, by the
deputy of Edward K. of England, and of Antoine of Bourbon, D. of Vendosme,
with the Duchess of Mantua, who since notwithstanding left those names, to
take that of his Fathers, so as he shall be ever hereafter named Henry the third,
K. of France and of Pologne.

The Baronnie of Montmotency erected into a Duchy, with right of a Petre.
Much about the same time, the K. curious to acknowledge from well to better, the
good and agreeable services done unto him by Ane de Montmorency his Constable,
erected his Barronie of Montmorency into a Duchy, together with the right and
prerogative of a Peer.

If the French lived in peace, the Germans smallye caring for their rest,
prepared themselves not only to a civil and dangerous war, but also desired
to bring in among them, the Prince of the Flower de Lys, for a counterpease to
the Emperor Charles, whom they sought to enforce, for the delivery of the
Saxon and Landgraue, which he held prisoners, as also to restore Germanye to
her former estate. To this end they had already made him to understand,
together with their complaints, what means they had to constrain him
thereunto, if he would but relieve them with his succor. To which the K. of
France being councelled to listen and yield all favor, for natural and
ancient desire to abate the greatness of such an enemy, before that he would
put his forces into the field, (to which he gave the Rende-uous at Vitry in
Partois, having already sent the Governors into their Provinces, to leuye the
best trained, and most voluntary Soldiers that they could) he caused to be
published throughout his own Realm, Italye, high and low Germanye, and other
quarters, the declaration of his will and true purpose touching those succors,
which he was minded to yield unto them. The letter which he caused to be
made, The K. letter to the Electors.
to this effect at Fontaine-bleau, the 3. of February 1552. which Du Fresne
brought with him into Germany for the same end, were of this tenor. That the
greatness of an estate Royal, fetching his increase from the enterprises which
redounded to the profit of many, and above all to the friends of a Crown, he
in like sort was ever studied from his infancy in this holy exercise, and in a
desire to show himself gracious, and succourable to the whole world, and that
therefore coming to be King, he had likewise undertaken the protection of the
Queen and Realm of Scotland, renewed the ancient alliance with the Suizers,
and in the end concluded peace with his Brother the King of England, that the
Emperor had lesie no craft or wilines, whereby he might break this peace, to
the end that France might be enwrapped with war and discordes, albeit that
hitherto himself was never willing to have begun the broile, or to arm
against him, standing only to his own defense. But having heard the particular
complaints and greefes of sundry Princes, Lords, and States of Germanye, as
touching the tirannie and violence which the Emperor used over them, under
color of reuniting those whom the diversity of religion had separated and
disioyned, of reforming of abuses, and ouerrunning the Turk, a common enemy
to Christendom. And seeing that herein he went about nothing else the^ to
encroche upon the Monarchy, and make it successiue to the house of Austria:
for these considerations the K. remembering that he was descended from the blood
of the ancient Franks or Francons, issued out of Germany, and the perpetual
alliance and amity, which in all time had been between the Gallique nation
and the Germane, the which the Emperor and his Grandfather ever went about to
break, he could do no less then have regard thereunto, and provide for such
mischiefs as are offered themselves on that part, as the Emperor should execute
his plats and enterprises. His most christian Majesty, fearing leash the
alteration of the Germane liberty might prove the ruin of that Nation, and by
consequence a great shaking to the glory and power of the Gauls, which have
Germany for their rampire, has considered it to be a matter almost necessary
for all Christendomes preservation, that they should join their forces
together, to came whatsoever he were, any one that should presume to encroche
ought upon their liberties: it imported further, that his Majesty had seen so
great disorder among the Princes and States of the empire, that he was not
able to judge whether all, or part of them, had prayed him to show himself a
protector and defendor of this Germane liberty almost shaken in pieces: that
at this time many Princes as well Electors as other, had besought him to assist
them, and be their help in this so urgent a necessity. And in case that he
would not do it, he protested before God and men, the mischief that was
likely to befall them, and of which his Majesty only should be the cause,
greatly iniurying his own reputation, and doing wrong to that which he owes to
the ancient league between Gaul and Germany. Besides that he showed to those
Princes, Electors, and others, and to the free Cities, that since that Charles
and his brother had taken upon them to command the Empire, every thing fell
into confusion and disorder. And that that was true, a man might see with his
eye, how he had fleeced the Empire, the Cities, comminalties, and other
places, as Gueldres, Vtrech, Cambray, and Constance, which he had made become
proper to the House of Austria: and that by a thousand devices he went about to
encroche upon the Archbishop of Treues, and the Dukes of Cleues and Witemberg,
and clean to ruin the principality of Hess. The King further complained how
that Charles and Ferdinand had clean excluded the Ambassadors of France,
from the Dietts and general assemblies of Germany, where in times past they
had their place: and that contrary to the liberties of Germany, he would bridle
the liberty of the Soldiers, and keep them from serving any in the wars but
himself: and that it was not lawful for them to come under his pay, without
incurring of condemnation, as breakers of his Edicts, and attainted of treason:
he blamed the Emperor of Fellonye and crueltye, in causing many brave warriers
to be cruelly put to death, because they had received pay of the K. of France,
he made instance of the Colonel Vgesberg, whom the Emperor caused to be
beheadded in his own presence, of the banishmentes and confiscations decreede
against Captain Recrod, the Ryngraue, Riffiberg, and Schertelin, against whom
he showed himself so obstinately and cruelly carried, that he caused to be
proclaimed by sound of Trumpet, 4000. Crowns to whosoever could bring alive or
dead any of these Lords, to make a good pastime with the effusion of Germane
blood, for the Spanish bands. This discourse and other matters finished, he
concluded that he had made an alliance with sundry of the Princes of Germanye,
and that together with them he was resolved to imploye both his forces and his
person, for defense of the liberty of whole Germanye: without expecting any
other recompense, then the honor, in having done his duty, and tied unto him
so puissant a nation as the Germane, of which this his desire and pretense, he
gave assurance upon his oath, taking God to witness, and swearing that in the
word of a King, and faith of a Prince: and that in general having no other
intention, then to deliver all the estates of Germanye from the oppression of
the Emperor, and of his: in particular, he pretended to do it in favor of
his most dear and most beloved Cosins, John Duke of Saxe, and Philip Landgraue
of Hess, detained in miserable servitude by Charles, whatsoever he had
promised or sworn to the contrary, thereby to get immortal praise as sometimes
did Flaminius, for having affranchised Greece. And toward the latter end of
the letter were these words: We promise you in liksorte by the almighty God,
before all the Kings, Princes, and Potentates of Christendom, that we will not
in any sort suffer, that either to you in general, or to any one in
particular, of what estate or condition souer he be, to our knowledge any wrong
or injury shall be offered. And less will we endure, who carry the title of most
Christian, that any damage shall be done to the goods and persons of you, most
reverend Prelates, Abbots, and other of the Clergy, as it has been
wrongfullye given out by our adversaries: rather we determine to receive you
into our protection and safegarde, provided that you declare your selves for us
and our allies: and give us sufficient assurance of your intents, hoping for
the reunion of the Church, which we attend by the recovering of the public
liberty: to which we will employ (God willing) all our power, the which we
were willing to let you to understand, most reverend Prelates, and most
excellent Princes, and other the estates of the holy Empire, to the end you
should not be ignorant of the true occasion of this war: by which we pretend
to pursue the Emperor with fire and sword, and (albeit very loath) to cut him
of as a rotten member from the body of the common wealth, or at the least to
enforce him to cease offering you any more injury. As touching ought which more
particularly may touch us, or the affairs of the holy Empire, you shall know
it by our beloved and feal councellor and Ambassador John du Fresne B. of
Bayonne, whom to this end we have dispatched, praying you to give credence
unto him, in whatsoever he shall deliver on our part, and that by him you will
advertise us of your intention. Yeouen at Fountaine-bleau the 3. of February
1552. and in the 5. year of our reign. By this so autenticall a promise and
solemn league, the K. made him self defendor of the Germans, and was called
Father of the country, and protector of the Germane nation and holy Empire:
and was so proclaimed throghout all the imperial cities, with inscription and
triumphant arcks and shows, reco^mending this his courtesy, that of gallantnes
of mind, he would at so great charge oppose himself, to so happy and puissant
a Monarch. On the top of this writing printed in the vulgar tongue, there was
a hat between two daggers, and written about liberty: underneath was the K.
represented, who called himself Protector of Germany, and of the Princes in
Captivity.

Whereas he said that the Emperor had ordained a price to such as could kill
certain of his Colonels, it was thus. Charles 5. reviving his Edicts, had
again banished out of the empire the Colonels Ringraue, Recrod, Ritteberg, and
Schertelin, all in the Kings wages, so far as to promise 4000. crowns, to
whomsoever would bring any of them unto him alive or dead: for they pushed hard
at the wheel, and after the league was concluded whereof we have spoken,
carried souldiars into France.

In the mean season Maurice having left his Brother Augustus behind him as
his Liuetenant in his Country, marched into the field, and with the
Landgraues son, who took with him Du Fresne the K. Ambassador, joined
together the forces of the associates at Tonouert. Afterward Albert of
Brandebourg came unto them with a great number of foot and horse, at Koburg,
they brought all as they passed along under their subjection, and infringing
whatsoever had been ordained by the emperor, they established there new
officers, and a new kind of government, constraining al to furnish them with
money; albeit the Emperor, and especially his brother Ferdinand besought the^ of
peace, for which they promised their best endeavor, notwithstanding that the
emperor caused the drum to be stroke up at the foot of the mou^tains, for the
assembling of his army: an occasion that Maurice went to Lincy in Austria, to
know of Ferdinand the conditions of peace, for he was willing to pacify
matters at the will of the emperor, who on the other side had exhorted by his
letters the principal Princes of Germany that they would bestow some pains in
quenching this uproar, and advise of some means of peace, to which his best
endeavor should not be wanting: and whereas some demanded succor of him, not
seeing themselves strong enough against so great a force, he assured them of a
good hope, answering that now they were in terms of making peace, which as he
hoped should take good effect: if otherwise, he would succor the^ with his
means and the whole common wealth of Germany: Vlme was besieged 6. days, and
the 19. of April the Princes went to Stoach, a town of Hegouia where in the
name of the K. of France 3. months pay was given the^, according to the accord,
Hostages of France and Germany.
and there was given for hostage on the French part, James of the house of
March, for the other (to wit the Earl of Nantueil) died on the way. The
hostages which the Princes gave unto the King, were Christophle Duke of
Megelbourg, and Philip son to the Landgraue. The last of April the Princes
returned to the Danube, some leagues below Vlme. In the mean space Albert of
Brandebourg set fire on all the Towns and villages of Vlme, and got as much
money as he was able, afterward he took the forte of Helfesten, situated
upon an high mountain, and there put garrison: that done, he rated the town
of Gisling, which is three leagues from Vlme, with certain other villages
about, at 18. thousand crowns. In the mean while Maurice arrived at Lincy,
proposed certain articles touching the delivery of his father in law, for the
appeasing of the difference in religion and doctrine, of well and dulye
establishing the common wealth, The propositions of Maurice.
of making peace with the K. of France their companion and alye, of receiving
into grace the banished men, as the Ringraue and the other abouenamed, among
which was likewise Hedec, who some years before had placed himself in the
service of Maurice: but the Emperor had not set down any certain price to
him that could take him, were it for fear of offending Maurice, or any other
occasion. Upon that Ferdinande (who had with him his son Maximilian, his
son in law Albert of Bauieres, and the Emperors Ambassadors) made answer to
his demaundes, that the Emperor made no refusal to deliver the Landgraue,
provided that they laid aside their arms, for regard of religion and the
common wealth, it pleased him well that they should advise thereof in the first
assembly, but it was a matter too noisome to the Emperor to comprehend therein
the K. of France, and yet that Maurice might do well to know of the K. under
what conditions he would appoint it: as for the banished persons, they night
reenter into grace, so as they observed such conditions as the Emperor would
set down. Further Ferdinande demanded of Maurice aid against the Turk in
Hungary, The resolution of peace deserred, and wherefore.
after that the peace should be concluded, and that he would not suffer any
soldiers to retire toward the K. of France. To which Maurice answered that
it was not lawful for him to conclude of anything, without the consent of his
companions, so as they departed upon condition that the 26. of May they should
meet again at Passau, which is between Ratisbone and Lincy, at the
reencounter of Danube and Eno, whether the Princes who had the handling of the
matter, should repair, if not, their deputies furnished with ample power:
where we will leave the^ preparing of peace, and the French of war, for the
maintenance of the Germane liberty, as I will show you by and by, to the end
to run as far as into Prouence, where notable accidents present themselves,
worthy of the posterity.

I will not pass any further without informing you of a most notable
occurrence which happened in this time among the Prouencials, I have before
told you of the Albigeoise religion, The Vaudois of Prouence how, when, by
whom, and wherefore persecuted as Heretics.
and how by force the Albigeoise quitting of France, went to inhabit in diverse
cuntries of christendom, especially among the mountains of Sauoy, Piemont and
Prouence, where continuing the exercise of their religion, they were named
Vaudois. Now for that in all times they never acknowledged the supremacye of
the Pope, from whose doctrine theirs differed in many points, cheefelye after
the coming of Martin Luther, and publishing of his writings, which they
courageously embraced, as nearer approaching to their ancient doctrine, they
were oftentimes accused and pursued, as Heretics and Rebels to the
Magistrate, so as with the zeal of the Clergy, increasing the persecution
upon all Lutheranes, in the year 1540. at the instance of the Kings Proctor in
the Parliament of Aix in Prouence, the inhabitants of Merindol, were adiourned
in the person of certain named in the arrest (which we will recite) to
appear personally, according to which adiournement, the within named came to
Aix to present themselves to the Court. At the day assigned unto them, they
addressed themselves to the skilfullest Advocates, to ask their advise how
they were to guide and govern themselves in this affair. The Advocates and
Proctors told them, that it was not lawful for them to give council unto any
that were suspected of the Lutherane sect. Notwithstanding one secretly and
aparte advertised them, that they were not to present themselves to the said
Court, except they were ready, and prepared to endure to be burned, yea at
little fire, without any form or figure of trial: for that had already been
concluded of among them. With these speeches the Merindoliens were greatly
astonished, and more afterward when indeed they saw sundry of their sect to be
cruelly murdered, having no other cause alleged for their condemnation, but
that they had spoken and maintained such matters, as had been declared
Lutherane, by the censures and determinations of the Doctors in Diuinitye,
which they of Merindal perceiving, retired themselves without ever appearing at
the assignation, so as defaulte was pronounced against them, by virtue whereof
the Court ordained an Arrest, which ever after was called the Arrest of
Merindol, the tenor whereof was in this wise. At the demand the profit and
vtility of defaultes obtained by the Kings Proctor General, Arrest of the
parliament of Aix.
demaunder in case of crime of divine and humane treason, against Andrew
Menard, and adiourned to three peremptory days, not appearing, but making
defaulte, the charges and informations considered, made at the request of the
K. Proctor general, They were about 24. as well inhabitants of Merin, dolas,
other their neighbors.

adiournementes of peremptorye days, being decerned against the said accused,
and making defaulte the 30. of July 1540. the said adiournements of 3.
peremptory days being passed, the defaults obtained by the said Proctor
general, against the said accused, the K. letters patents of the last of May
in the said year 1540. addressed to the said Court, to proceed against the
Vaudois and Lutheranes, and other holding contrary sects, and derogating from
the Christian faith and religion: and also other letters pattents of the said
Lord, of the 16. of July 1535. and of the last of May 1536. by which he
granted pardon and grace, to such as were charged, accused, and suspected of
heretical errors, so as they would renounce the said errors, and abjure them
within six months, after the publication of the said letters, the certificat
of the witnesses, having been well examined in the above said informations,
other charges, informations, and process, being brought forth by the said
Proctor general, to make it appear how most notoriously all they of Merindol
hold Vaudoise and Lutherane sects, reproved, and contrary to the holy faith and
christian religion, withdrawing and concealing many strangers and fugitives
charged to be of the same sect, nourishing and favoring of them, how in the
same place there is a school of errors and false doctrines of the said sects,
which dogmatise their said errors and false doctrines, and bookbinders, which
imprint and sell books full of such false doctrine: and also that they of
Merindol under the ground, and in rocks, have made caves wherein they retire
and hide themselves, their accomplices and goods, and make themselves strong:
other information being taken by the judge of Apt, to make it more manifest,
how after that Colin Palleng named of the plane of Apt, as a sectator of the
said sects, was some days passed condemned and burned, and his goods
confiscate to the K. in despite hereof many of the said people of Merindol,
their accomplices and adherents in great assemblies of six or seven score men
armed with harquebuses, halbeards, swords, and other weapons, brake into the
Mill of the said Colin Palleng and Thomas Palleng brethren, beat and outraged
the Miller, and threatened him and as many as should intermeddle with any goods
of any their sect. All this considered, it was said that the Court has said
and declared, does say and declare, the said defaultes to have been well
obtained, and for the profit of them, that all the abouesaide accused, and
adiourned are true defaulters, and stubborn, barred of all defense, attainte,
and convinced of the cases, and crimes laid unto them: having detained,
maintained, and followed hareticall sects and doctrines, reproved, and contrary
to the faith and Christian religion, and to the holy prohibitions of the King:
and being the retirers and receivers, the releeuers and favorers of men
charged, and diffamed to hold like damnable doctrines, and reproved sects,
for remedy whereof, it has condemned, and does condemn the above named: and
in case that they cannot be taken and apprehended, from henceforward it has
banished them al, and does banish them out of the Realm, lands and signories
of the K. with interdiction and prohibition, not once to enter therein upon
pain of the gallows, and declares all and every the goods of the abouesaid
condemned, and banished, their wives, children and families, acquitted and
confiscate to the said L. and also prohibiteth all Gentlemen, vassales, and
other subjects of the said Lord, that they receive not, nor conceal any of the
said condemned, their wives, children, servants, or families, nor give them any
favor, aid or comfort, in any manner whatsoever, upon pain to such as shall
do the contrary of confiscation of their goods, and other arbitrary pains.
And moreover considering that all the said place of Merindol, is the notorious
retreat, den, refuge, and forte of people holding such damnable and reproved
sects, the said court has ordained and does ordain, that all the houses
builded in the same place shall be pulled down, razed, and laid even with the
ground, and the said place be left uninhabitable, so that none shall reedifie or
build there, without the pleasure and permission of the K. likewise that the
Castle, and den, ram parts and forts, being in the rocks and woods of the
land of the said Merindol shall be ruined, and laid in such sort, as none shall
be able to make there any more residence, and that the places shall be uncovered,
and the woods where such fortes are cut down, and grubbed 200. paces about:
and further it prohibiteth and forbids, that no part of the inheritance of
the said place shall be let to farm, rent, or otherwise, to any of the surname
or line of the above condemned. Published in judgment at the Parliament of
Prouence sitting at Aix the 18. of November 1540.

Particular judgments upon the merit of the arrest.
Afterward the court ordained to every judge ordinary, of Aix, Tomes, S.
Maximia and Apt, the execution of what might concern him in the Arrest, which
many found very strange, as a thing done too headily against persons, which
never were once heard or come to their answer, yea so cruelly against the
feminine sex, and young infants, and the execution made against all of a whole
country, albeit the proceedinges, had only been against certain particular men
therein mentioned. Others holding with the arrest said, that in case of
Lutherane sect, judges were not bound to observe either common or ordinary law,
so as it tended to the rooting out of those, which are suspected to be such.
The president La Chassane differreth the execution of the arrest, and his
reasons.
And to set forward the execution, the Archbishop of Arle, the B. of Aix and
others, met oftentimes, soliciting the President La Chassane, and other, to
the same effect: so far as to assure them to furnishe their charges, and to
turn upon them any the Kings indignation or other men's, who said he might
very well be angry at such a destruction of his subjects: and that it was
rather made to hold in awe the Lutheranes, being so great a number of them in
Prouence, then to execute it according to the Tenor: and moreover that it was
not definitive, and that the laws and ordinances of the Realm do not permit
the execution before other procedings, yet they prevailed so far as he
co^descended unto the^, and stroke up the drum to assemble the people of
Prouence which were commanded to march, which they did: Cause of delay of the
execution.
but they were as soon countermanded and discharged by the lively propositions
among other of a very learned gentleman named D. Alence, how that this
proceeding by way of act and force, was against all form and order of
justice, and without distinction of the culpable, and innocente. Now it was so
as this President had put in light and published in print, a book entitled
Catalogus gloriae Mundi, Catalogus gloriae mundi, made by Chassane, and printed
at Lions.
in which by way of pastime he set down the proceedings which he fained had
sometimes been held against the Rats, by the officers of the spiritual Court
of the B. of Authun, as if it were, that through all the Bailliwick of
Laussois, there had been such a quantitye and great multitude of Rats, that
they destroyed and eat the corn of all the Country, whereupon it was thought
good that some body should be sent to th'officiall of Authun, to excommunicate
these Rats, and that thereupon the Official having heard the plaintiff of the
Proctor fyscall, ordained before that he would proceed to excommunication,
that a warning should be given by order of justice, whereby the Rats should be
cited at 3. peremtorye days, and for default of appearance then to proceed,
etc. The three days being passed, the Proctor presented himself against the
Rats, and for fault of appearance obtained default: by virtue whereof he
demanded that they would proceed to excommunication: whereupon it was
iudicially concluded, that the Rats should be provided of an Advocate to hear
their defense, etc. considering it was a question of their total rooting out
and destruction. This Gentleman serving his turn herewith, said to the
President. Sir, remember the council which you wrote in a matter of nothing,
when as being the K. Advocate at Authun, you defended the Rats, and declared
that the time given unto them to appear in was to short, and moreover how
there was so many Cats in the villages, as the Rats had some reason to absent
themselves, etc. with many other rightes and passages alleged by you, and
amply handled in your book made at pleasure. Now so it is Sir, as by such a
pleading of a matter of vain importance, you have gotten the brute to have
rightlye set down the manner whereby judges ought to proceed in criminal
matters: now will you not learn right by your own book, which will even
manifestly condemn you, if you proceed any further to the destruction of these
pore people of Merindol? is it not as convenient that they should have as much
law and equity as you will give to Rats? Through these persuasions the President
was so much moved, that incontinently he revoked the commission which was
given, and caused the men of war to retire who was come within one league and a
half of Merindol, whereof they of Merindol rendered thanks to God, comforting
one another, and animating themselves for ever to retain the fear of God, and
submit themselves to his providence. The brute of this enterprise, and
execution of the said arrest together with the patience and constancy of them
of Merindol, grew so great, and esteemed of such importance, that it was not
hid to K. Francis, who sent letters to Langeay, who at that time was his
lieutenant in the country of Piemont, to make dilligent enquiry of the truth of
the whole matter: Guillaume du Bellay. L. of Langeay, lieuetenant for the K. in
Piemont.
whereupon he sent into Prouence two personages, to whom he gave charge to
bring him the coppie of the Arrest, and to enquire of all that which followed,
and likewise of the life and manners of them of Merindol, and the rest which
were persecuted in the country of Prouence, which they did, and counted unto
him the injustice, pilferies, and villainies which as well the ecclesiastical as
secular judges daily used against the^ of Merindol and other. And as touching
the life and ma^ners of the said persecuted persons, they made report that the
greatest part of the inhabitants of the country of Prouence, affirmed that
those which were persecuted were people of great travail, and that since 200.
years they retired out of the country of Piemont, to dwell in Prouence, and
had taken to see farm many hamlets destroyed by the wars, and other desolate
places: besides so great laborers they were, and so good husbands, that in the
places where they inhabited was great abundance of corn, wine, oil, honey,
almonds, and great cattle, so as the whole country about was relieved thereby,
yea that before they came to inhabit in the said country, Merindol was used
to be let for four crowns by year, and now it amounts to above 350.
crowns yearly rent to the Lord: and that it was even so in Lormarin, and
sundry other places of Prouence, which dad been deserts and laid open to
thieves, until such time as they came thither to inhabit. They found likewise
by information made in Prouence, that the Merindols and other of the
persecuted, were a peaceable people, beloved of all their neighbors, of fair
conditions, keeping their promises, and paying well their debts, without suit or
brabling, charitable, not suffering any to be in need, of great alms to
strangers, and other poor passengers according to their power. The Prouenaeals
affirmed likewise, that they of Merindol, and the rest might very well be
discerned from all other of the country of Prouence, for that they could never
be brought so much as to name the Devil, or any ways to swear, if it were not
in judgment, or passing of some contract. A man might likewise know them for
that if they were in any company where lascivious speech were used, or
blasphemy against the honor of God, they would incontinently depart out of the
same: we know not any other matter against them, saving (said they of Prouence)
that when they go to the market or about the town, they are so seldom seen go
into the Minster, and if they do chance to go in, they say their prayers
without regarding of either he or she Saint, and that in the high way as they
pass by crosses and images, they use no reverence. The Priests being likewise
hard as touching the same, said that they did not cause any Mass to be said,
nor Libera me, nor De Profundis, and that they never took any holy water, and
if any were given them at their houses, that they would never say grandmercie
to him that brought it, and they perceived very well that they conned him small
thanks, that they never went on pilgrimage to gain pardons, that they never
made the sign of the cross when it thundered, but only looked up into heaven
sighing, and prayed without crossing themselves, or using any holy water, that
they were never seen make any offering, either for the living or for the dead.
In sum, Langeay following his charge, advertised K. Frauncis of the whole,
who having fully understood it, sent letters of grace, not only for such as
were condemned upon default and co^tumacy, but also for all other within the
country of Prouence, who were either accused or suspected for the like case,
commanding expressly the parliament, that from thence forward they should not
in such a case proceed so rigorously as they had done for the past. Behold the
letters.

The K. Letter in behalf of the Vaudois.
FRancis by the grace of God King of France, Earl of Prouence, Forcalquier,
and countries adjoining,
to our well-beloved and feal, the people holding our Court of Parliament in the
said Country of Prouence, sitting at Aix: health and love.
As we having understood, how some swarued from the right way of faith and
Christian Religion, whom they call Vaudois, assemble themselves in certain
places of our said Country of Prouence, where they continue in their errors,
through the seducing of some evil spirits, whereto it were necessary to yield
good and wholesome provision, to the end this venom may not proceed any
further: we make you to know, how we enclining rather to mercy and clemencye,
then to the rigor of justice, and willing to assaye rather by way of courtesy
and persuasion, to retire and redress the said wandered persons from the way
of salvation, then by rigorous punishments to make them fall into despair:
considering especially the great multitude of them, which they say are fallen
into these faults and errors, and that we may hope that through the bounty of
God our creator, they will rather reduce themselves to the way of salvation,
the^ to be out of the congregation of God, and faithful christians, and remain
continually in the fear of the rigorous justice as well of God as man. We for
these considerations have given and do give by these presents grace, pardon and
remission as much as in us lies; to the said Vaudois. And have acquitted the^,
and do acquit them of al pains and offenses, and of al punishments and
condemnation, which might touch them either in person, or goods, by virtue of
any judgment given, or to be given. Provided nevertheless, that within three
months after notise of these presents duly made unto them, they return to God
our creator, and make such an abiuration, and solemn recantation, as is
requisite for all the errors, and false doctrines, into which they have
heretofore fallen: from whence they shall entirely depart, and promise to live
Catholiquely and faithfully, as it is requisite and necessary for all good
Christians, living according to the law of God, and the Church. And to this
end, and for to understand, if they will accept of this our present grace and
mercy, we will that they shall come or send unto us, such a number of persons
as shall be thought fit and ordained by you, in full suertie as well to come,
remain, as return, without that during the said time any disturbance or
hinderance be offered unto them, in their persons, goods, or manner whatsoever.
And in case they shall not accept hereof, but remain in their obstinacy, you
shall make such punishment thereof, as you shall think the case deserves: and
for the better accomplishing hereof, we have given and do give full power,
authority, commission, and commandment by these presents. By which we will,
and command all our justices, officers and subjects, be they of war, or
otherwise, that to you, your commissioners and deputies, they lend, and give
all aid, favor and assistance, when and as often as by you and your deputies
it shall be required.

Yeouen at Fountaine-bleau the eight of February. The year of grace 1540. and
of our Reign 24.

Thus signed, by the K. Earl of Province, Bayard. These letters went for a
time suppressed, but in the end they were signified to certain prisonners,
who were detayned in the prisons of Aix, of whom it was demanded, if they
would take the benefit of those letters, which should be commnicated unto
them, every one paying one crown of the sum for the Coppie. By this means
the prisonners were enlarged in paying their expenses, and promysing to appear
at the Court, when and as often as they should be demanded.

Afterward having obtained that they might appear in Parliament by Proctor,
they took out a Copy of the proceedings against them, which before they had
not; at the request of the Kings Council, which pursued them, they sent a
confession of their faith, to Cardinal Sadolet Bishop of Carpentras, and
other, Confession of the Vaudois faith.
and after to King Francis the first, taught unto them (said they) ever since
1200. years after the coming of Christ: as their ancients and ancestors
witnessed unto them. The which his ordinary reader Castellanus read unto him,
containing the Articles of God the father creator of all things: of the son
advocate and intercessor for mankind: of the holy Ghost, comforter and teacher
of the truth of the Church, which they said to be assembled of all the
chosen, having Jesus Christ for head: Of ministers: Of the Magistrate, whom
they confessed ordained of God, to punish malefactors, and defend the good, to
whom it suffices not only to carry honor, but also to pay taxes and
Imposts, without acception of state whatsoever: and that at the example of
Christ who did likewise practice it: Of Baptism, which they maintained to be a
visible, and exterior sign, representing unto us the regeneration of the
spirit, and mortification of the members: Of the Lords Supper, which they
hold for a thanksgiving and commemoration of the benefit received by Christ:
Of marriage, which they said was not forbidden to any, by how much it was
holy, and ordained of God: Of good works, wherein they ought to employe
themselves continually: Of man's traditions, which they ought to shun:
protesting, in some that the rule of their faith, was the old and new
Testament: and that they believed al, which was contained in the Apostles
Creed. In conclusion they besought the King to give credit to their saying,
offering themselves to prove it false, if ought else had been otherwise
reported against them, whenever it should please him to give them audience.
In the mean time the Bishop of Aix, and of Cauaillon, pursued the execution
of the arrest; so as it was ordered by the Court of Parliament of Prouence,
that according to the Kings letters pattents, master John Durandy, a Councellor
of the Court with a secretary, and the Bishop of Cauaillon, with a doctor in
Divinity, should go to the place, and persuade the inhabitants of Merindol,
and cause them to abjure those errors, which most plainly they should make
appear unto them, and in case, that convicted by the word of God to have
followed and lived in errors, and heresies, they would not make recantation,
that then of all that had been done, Verbal process should be made, to
proceed against them as the Court should think good. But as the Churchmen
were in hand with them to make them recant their doctrine, they refused,
offering to prove it, by the word and truth thereof, and offering to renounce
if they could be proved heretics thereby. They were questioned with, and
answered simply: so as by little the persecution, not the hatred ceased
against them, especially upon the sudden death of Cassane, the President, of
John De Roma Monk a severe inquisitor, who would fill Boots with hot
scalding grease, and after make them to pull them on. Of which and such like
behauiors, Francis the second being advertised, gave commandment by his
letters pattents to the Parliament, that he should be arrested, and his process
made. But having warning thereof he fled to Auignon, where being ryfled of his
own servants, and from great wealth become a beggar, he was tormented with so
horrible griefs, that nothing could yield him any rest. So as no man being
able to endure the stincke of his ulcers, he desired naught, but to dye, which
he did. In the end John Minier, of Oppede, President, near to Merindol, and
Cabriers, (the inhabitants whereof had at an other time made head against him,
and put him to his heels) having given the King to understand, that as many of
them being assembled as came to fiftene thousand, they were gone in arms to
take Marseilles, and to Cantonise it, besides that all the Countries round
about were in great danger of being lost, being all Lutherans, he obtained
letters, to enable him to execute the arrest, by means of the Cardinal of
Tournon, and other, so as he prepared himself to the execution of the arrest
against Cabrieres, Merendol, and twenty two Villages. Whereof they being
advertised, repaired again to King Francis, in the year 1544. to whom they
gave to understand how from the year 1540. his Majesty having perceived the
evident oppression, and nullitie of the said arrest of contumacie, had caused
the execution thereof to be differred, forbidding there should be any more
proceeding in such rigor. And how notwithstanding many had oppressed them, and
meant to oppress them more, and more, briefly they presented unto him the whole
proceedings as above said. An occasion that he revoked the execution of the
arrest of contumacie, and all such proceedings as had been before done, and
agreed by the Parliament as well from which, as from his Proctor general, he
took away the Conisance of the cause, until he might be informed by one of
the masters of requests of his house, and a D. in Divinity of the University
of Paris, whom he had deputed to go to those places, to the end they might
well and amply inquire of the life, The proceedings used in the process of them
of Merindol.
faith, and conversation of those of Merindol, and the rest. This reuocation
was published in Parliament, and insinuated to the Proctor general in the end
of October following. The Parliament at the instigation of Oppede, commanded
Philip Courtin Husser of the Parliament, to make great suite for the obtaining
of the K. letters to execute the arrest, and notwithstanding the interdiction,
the Articles and instructions were made by the said president, with a request
signed by the Proctor general; yea the pursuit was made for money, which had
been ordained by the Parliament, for the charges of the suite: Whereupon
Courtin did so much by his diligence, and subtlety, that thorough the favor
of the Cardinal of Tournon, he obtained letters in the month of January
following, under the name of the K. Proctor general, from the privy council,
to put in execution the arrest of contumacy, notwithstanding the reuocation
above mentioned.

John Minier chief President, having received the letters sent unto him in
January 1545. which he concealed until the 12. of April, assembled the Court,
and there recited the K. letters, by which it was commanded that the arrest
should be put in execution, so as certain of the Parliament were appointed
Deputies for the execution. Minier promised to aid them, for because in the
absence of Grignan he was left his Liuetenant, in the government of Prouence,
The war lie exploit of Minier upon the execution of arrest.
he had before at the K. commandment levied troops of men of war, to go
against the English, but he served his turn with them against these. Moreover
he had sent a commandment to Marseiles, Aix, and Arle, under great pains to
all such as carried arms, that they should put themselves in readiness, and
march at their first call: there came likewise succors unto him out of the
Countye of Auignon, a possession of the Churches. Their first course
notwithstanding was not against Merindol, but over the Country near to the
town of Pertuis, so as the 15. of April Minier accompanied with a number of
Gentlemen and Captains, came to Cadenet, in the time that some of his company
ouerrunne two Villages near unto Durance, where practicing a thousand pillages
and insolences, they put all to the fire and sword, except a great number of
Cattle which they carried away with them, there was no less done in other
places. They of Merindol seeing all on a fire round about them, presented a
supplication to Minier, craving only liberty to depart in their shirts with
their wives and children into Germany, but having for answer that he would
send them all to inhabit in hell among the devils, they abandoned their
houses, and fled into the woods, passing that night near the Village of S.
Falaise in great fright. The inhabitants of the Village were already determined
to fly: likewise the B. of Cauaillon vice-legate of Auignon, had given charge
to some Colonel to make a short dispatche of the world, so as the next
morning they got somewhat further into the wood, for there was every where
danger throughout: and Minier had forbidden upon pain of death, that no soul
should help them, but that they should be all alike sacked wheresoever they
were found. The like forbidding was made in all places round about, bordering
upon the Popes territory: besides that the Bishops defraied a great part of
the army: The poor paisants then marched on through a monstrous vile way,
carrying their little children upon their shoulders, in their arms, or in
cradles, yea some of their wives following the^ great with child. Being arrived
at the place appointed, they found many who had saved themselves there, after
having lost all: but soon enough news was brought them, how Minier had gathered
together all his men of war to come and follow them: This was toward night,
an occasion that after a whiles co^sultation, they took a sudden and an hasty
deliberation, and for that they were to pass by hard and rude ways, they left
their wives, daughters and children, with some other, among which was one of
their Ministers: the other went on to Mussi, as they had agreede, hoping the
enemy would take some pity of such a multitude, without weapon, and unable to
defend it self: Every man may well guess what groans and sighs, what tears,
what imbracings they made one with another at the parting, having travailed
sore all night, and in the end gained the top of the Mountain of Lebron,
they could discover nothing but a number of villages and farms all on fire.
Minier hereupon divided his troops into two parts, and for that he had
understanding by a spy which way they of Merindal were gone, he went to the
village and sent the rest to follow them. Before that these men had entered the
forest, a certain Quidam of pity being moved, ran before, so as being at
the brim of the Rock, and having cast two stones where he gessed those people
rested, cried out to them that had reposed themselves, that they should fly to
save their lives, albeit that he no ways perceived them. At that instante two
of those that were gone to Mussi, gave them warning that their enemies were
coming, and then they made the Minister run away, with the rest which were
left to guard the women, showing to them a high way throughout the Forest, by
which they might escape: hardly were they departed, but that the soldiers were
come with fair naked swords, and great howtes, crying that all should pass
by the point and edge of their swords: notwithstanding they put none to the
sword. But after many insolences, they led away the women bare both of victual
and money, hindered of doing worse by a Capten of horse, who by chance passed by,
and threatened that they should die if they did the contrary: but commanded them
with all speed to repair to Minier, so as the enterprise was clean broken of:
in sort that having left the women, which were above 500. they rushed on upon
the butyn, and cattle. Minier in the mean time came to Merindol, and finding
it clean void of inhabitants, pilled and burned it, after an horrible
execution done of whatsoever was found therein, for having met with a young lad,
he made him be tied to an Olive tree, and slain with harquebuse shot: from
thence he went to the town of Cabrieres, battred it with Canon, and by means
of Captain Poulin, persuaded the inhabitants to open unto him the gates, and
yield themselves, promising the^ that they should sustain no injury: but anon
after that the Soldiers became masters, every one was cut in pieces, without
regard of age, sex, religion, alliance, neighborhood, or any other respect,
some fled into the temple, other into caves of the castle, but they were all
drawn thence, and led through a medowe, where being stripped bare, they
passed all by the sharp of the sword, not only men, but women, and of them
some great with child: afterward Minier made about 40. women to be enclosed
into a barn full of hay and straw, where he set it a fire, and as some strove
to quench it with the wind of their gowns, and prevailed naught, other ran to
the windows of the barn, into which they were wont to pitch in the hay, with
intent to have leaped down: but being driven back from thence with blows of
Pikes and Clubs, they were all burnt the 21. of April. After that Minier sent
one part of the army against La Cost, they so no sooner were departed, then
those were found which were thrust together in the cave of the Castle of
Cabrieres, then all cried out against those that were shut in the cave, and
calling back those which were gone to La Cost, they made likewise as strange a
shambles, without reserving any one: eight hundred were counted for dead, as
well without as within: sundry infantes which were saved were rebaptised, that
done Minier sent his troops to La Cost: the Lord whereof had already
persuaded the Citizens to carry all their arms into the Castle, and to raze
the town in four places, promising upon his credit with Minier, that no
injury should be offered unto them, he was believed and obeyed: but departed
from thence to beseech Minier, he was not far until he found the army, which
spared not to pass forward: at the first entrye they did naught to the town,
but the next morrow they gave a more fresh assault, upon a few that defended
it, so as having set the fanebourges on fire, they took it at their ease,
because that many that were fearful slunke away, and slipped down by ropes,
abandoning their companies, and the place ordained for their defense. In sum,
the town being taken and pilled, with great murder of all such as were met
there, they run all to a garden near unto the Castle, where without any
regard they enforced the wives, and maids which were retired thither with a
great fright: yea having shut the^ in a whole day and a night, they entreated
them so inhumanely, as such as were with child and the young maids died
presentlye after. In the mean time they of Merindol and their companions,
wandering through the woods and rocks, if they were taken, as soon slain, or
sent to the Galleys, saving those which died of famine. About 25. were hidden
near unto the town of Mussi, within a cave, but being disclosed they were all
as well strangled as burned, There was not then any kind of cruelty that was
not practiced, some but very few escaped the slaughter, who saved themselves at
Geneue, and places bordring upon it. Now for that the K. before continued the
persecutions and burning pains against the Lutheranes. The princes of Germany
write to the King of France in favor of such of his subjects as were
persecuted.
In the month of May the Protestant Princes of Germany, besought the K. by
letters written from Ratisbone, for his subjects who were so researched and
pursued for the same faith which they held. And for that some made their own
peace, redeeming their life, their goods, and estates, by abiuration of their
faith, they besought him that that condition might be taken away, declaring how
dangerous a thing it was so to wound and make servile the consciences of men.
But the brute of so strange an effusion of blood animated them the more, and
offended many, which greatly abated the credit which the King had gotten
throughout Germanye: no less then in Zuizerland where the reformed ceased not
as nearest neighbors, to be mediators toward the K. that he would take pity
of th'escaped: but for a full answer, he sent unto the^ word, that for just
cause he had commanded that execution to be done, and that they had no more to
do with what he did in his own country, or what punishment of justice he made
over his malefactors, then he had to intermeddle with their affairs. See now
how the will and nature of men changing with the affairs and reports: King
Frauncis ordained a punishment for the Authors of this tragedy: how his son
Henry carried himself in the execution thereof, and all that which followed,
to serve for most remarqueable occurrences, which may possible happen to any
estate.

That which moved Henry 2. King of France, to publishe his letters pattentes,
in form of adiournement, against those of the Parliament of Prouence, who had
shed the blood of the inhabitants of Cabriere and Merindol, and other
neighbors about, was that his Father King Francis at the point of death,
touched with remorce and grief, that he could not before he died make a
punishment in example of such, as under his name and authority, This touch at
the point of death, leaves neither King not subject unsought, without any
respect: an especial warning to all princes.
had wrought so strange cruelties against his subjects of Prouence, charged
his son with great obtestations, not to defer the punishment, how otherwise God
who leaves no such outrages and sackings unpunished, would work the revenge,
and so much the more (says he) as this affair touches our honor among all
nations, it cannot be better repaired, then in making all them suffer, who in
such cruelty abused the duty of their charge, without sparing great or small,
weak or mighty: that by their example all men hereafter might take heed of
any the like enterprises. This was the occasion why King Henry decreede by his
letters pattents as follows.

Letters pattents against the executioners of the arrest in Prouence, upon
Cabrieres and Merindol.
HEnry by the grace of God King of France,
to our first Hussier greeting:
Our Proctour in our great Council, appointed by us Proctour in causes after
mentioned, has caused to be delivered and told unto us, how in the year
1540. the 18. day of November, there was a certain judgment given in our
Court of Prouence, which they would call and term the arrest of Merindol, by
virtue of which 14. or 16. particular men therein named, inhabitants of
Merindol, stood condemned for defaulte and contumacy, to be burned as
heretics and Vaudois: and in case they could not be apprehended, to be burned
in picture, and their wives, infants, and maidens, were defeated and abandoned:
and in case they could not be taken, they were then pronounced banished, and
their goods confiscate, a matter notoriously iniust, against al law and reason.
And albeit that the inahbitants of the said Merindol were never heard nor
called to their answer, yet by the said judgment it was set down that all the
houses of the said Merindol should be thrown down, and the town made
uninhabitable. And in the year 1544. the said inahbitants made their repair to
the late K. of famous memory our father last deceased, whom God absolve, and
others who were likewise held for heretics, declaring how against all truth
they were termed Vaudois, and heretics. They obtained letters of our said
late Lord and father, whom they had let to understand, how they were daily
troubled and molested by the Bishops of the Country, and by the Presidents and
Counselors of our Parliament of Prouence, who had already sued for their
confiscations and lands for their kinsfolks, minding hereby to drive them
clean out of the Country: beseeching our said late Father, that he would
search out the truth. Whereupon it was ordained, that a Master of Requests and
a Doctor of Divinity, should go down to those places, and thoroughly enquire
of their manner of livings and for that the said Lord could not so readilye
send thither, he should in the mean time take into his own hands, all such
suits as were depending by reason thereof: and forbid all cognoissance thereof
to the people of our court of Parliament of Prouence, the which euocation was
signified to our said court the 25. of October following: which standing much
discontented with the contents thereof, sent to the K. an Hussier to pursue
letters of reuocation, which were obtained the first of January after, by which
upon information made to the late Lord the King, how they had been in arms,
in great assembly, forcing towns and Castles, pulling prisonners out of
prisons, and rebellious to all justice, keeping it in subjection, the said
late Lord permitted them to execute the Arrestes given against them, reuoking
the said letters of euocation, in regard of the relapse having not abiured:
And ordained that all such as should be found charged and culpable of heresy,
and the Vaudoise sect, should be extermined. And that to that end the Governor
of the Country, or his Lieuetenant, should thereto employ his forces, whereby
justice might be obeyed: which letters were not signified but kept until the
12. of April following, which was the day of Quasimodo, on which day after
dinner, the first President Master John Minier, caused the said Court to
assemble, and caused our Proctour to present the said letters, and require
execution of the said pretended Arrest, of the 18. of November 1540. of which
no mention was made in the said letters, but only in general terms of arrests
given against the Vaudois: and hereupon it was set down, that the said
pretended arrest should be executed according to the form and tennor, making
like error as before. And that the said Commissioners already deputed, should
go to the said place of Merindol, and other places requisite and necessary
for the execution thereof, and that all those that were of the said sect
should be extermined, and such as were taken prisonners should be led into the
Gallyes for a prison: there were appointed for the executioners, Master
Francis de la Fond, second President, Honor de Tributiis, and Bernard de Badet
Counselors, with whom likewise, M. John Minier President, went as Lieuetenant
to our said late Father, to give as he said a strong hand only to justice,
and to that should be needful thereunto: and carried with him* men and
artillery, who never keeping the way to Merindol, went to Cadenet, in which
place the said Minier held a council in the said quality of liuetenant of our
said late father; and upon that they said it was reported unto the^, how there
were a great number of the said inhabitants in arms, who made a bulwark,
without any further inquiry, they concluded to go assail them to break the
said Bulwark, and kill them all if they resisted, and if they fled, that their
houses should be burned, distributing to the Captains sundry villages to be
burned, and consequently ransackt, albeit there was no mention made at all
thereof in the said pretended arrest, which they would seem to execute, nor
any of the said inhabitants either in general or particular, at any time
called to their answer. Sundry villages were distributed to Captain Poulin,
appertaining to the Lady of Cental, who had both advertised him, and also the
said Minier; how her Senates were good laboring men, and good christians, and
not of the Vaudois sect, praying them not to offer unto the^ any injury,
offering to make them submit themselves, and obedient to justice; whereof the
said Poulin advertised the said Minier, President, and how he had sent unto
him a man of the long roabe to know what he should do. Notwithstanding without
having any regard at all to the said aduertisements, there were 22. towns
burned and pillaged, without any inquisition or cognoisance of cause of those
which were culpable or innocent, and without any resistance made of the
inhabitants part, or any bulwark, and therwithall the goods of the said
inhabitants had been pilled, and many women and maidens forced, and other
execrable crimes committed; that done, the said pretended Commissioners went to
Merindol, where they found only one poor boy of 18. or 20. years of age, who
had hid himself, whom they caused to be tied to an olive tree, and killed
with harquebuses shot; then pillaged the town, and burned it, and that done
they went to Cabrieres, where were slain men, women, and maidens ravished,
even within the Church: great number of men bound together, and carried into a
Meadow, and there cut in pieces, and sundry other most execrable cases
committed, the said Minier there assistant. About La Cost were many men
slain; women and maidens ravished, to the number of 25. within one grange, and
infinite pillages committed for the space of more then 3. weeks: and the said
Minier imagining the better to be able to cover the said cruelties and
inhumanities, made a commission narratiue, how he was advertised that they had
as well pillaged and sacked the good as the bad Christian and Vaudois, by which
he commanded to be proclaimed by sound of trumpet, a forbidding to pill any
save such as leave should be given against, by our said late Father, or
himself. Also he set forth another commission in these terms; ye Captains
and Soldiers, who have in charge to ruin and waste the persons and goods of
the Vaudois, touch not the tennants of the L. of Faulcon, who was his kinseman,
forbiddance was also made by sound of trumpet, as well by the authority of the
said Minier, as of the said de la Fond, not to give either to eat or to
drink to any of the Vaudois, without knowing who they were, and that upon
pain of the Iibbet: by reason whereof many women, children, and old people
were found along the ways eating and feeding upon grass like brute beasts,
and in the end dead for extremity of hunger. After the said cruelties and
inhumanites thus committed and done, they sent commisioners to inform who
they were which were suspected of heresy, and made a number be carried to the
Galleys, by form of prison, where a great part since is dead: other their
inditements being made, they enlarged quousque, saving unto our Proctor more
amply to inform, and other they condemned in little fines, other they purely
and simply absolved, and chiefly the subjects of the Lady Cental, as appears
by the judgments produced: and yet all their houses should remain burned, and
their goods pillaged: for this cause the said first and second Presidents, and
the said de Tributijs and Badet counselors, seeing how euilly they had
proceeded, and contrary to the tenor of the said letters of our said late
Father, which required cognoisance of the cause, seeing also how the people of
our said parliament of Prouence, had given judgment contrary to al right and
reason, the better imagining to be able to cover their faults, assembled
together the 5. of May following, and upon the speech and report of the said
Minier and de la Fond, they gave another judgment upon the pretended arrest,
that the execution begun should be perfected, and that to this end should be
sent of the commisioners of our said Court, into each of the benches, to make
their process, and declare the confiscations of goods, and again the 20. of the
said month and year they again assembled, and gave an other judgment
according to the precedents, containing sundry heads still thinking to cover
their faults; and knowing that the complaint was come as far as to the ears of
our said late Father, they sent the said de la Fond toward him, who under
his information and process verbal, obtained letters. yeouen at Arques the 18.
of August 1545. approving under hand the said execution, never having let our
said late father to understand the truth of the fact, but supposed by those
letters, that all the inhabitants of such towns as were burned, were condemned
and adjudged for heretics and Vaudois: by which letters they were commanded
to receive to mercy all such as would repent and abjure: and since we being
advertised of the truth of the fact, how, without any distinction between the
culpable and the innocent, contrary to all form and order of justice, and
without any judgment or comdemnation before given against them, they proceeded
by way of fact, and of force, whereupon those cases and crimes abouesaid
ensued, had appointed commisioners to inform, and that the criminal process
should be made to the said Minier, la Fond, de Tributijs and Badet, in the
proceeding to whose judgments, our Proctor did require from the first day
commission to call the people of our court of parliament of Prouence, to come to
answer by Proctor or Sindic, to such conclusions as he purposed to take against
them, for the iniquity and occular error of the said judgments, which were
the causes of the said crimes, cruelties and iniquities, upon which there has
not as yet been done him any right: and seeing that they passed further in
judgment of process, without thereupon doing any right, doubting he would say
that he was not the appellant, he presented a request to the Commissioners
chosen by us Judges of the said process, to the end he might be received
appellant, of the execution of Merindol, and of that which ensued thereon. And
for that to receive our said Proctor appellant of an approved execution, by an
arrest or judgment of a court of Parliament, depended only of our authority,
and the power and commission of our said commissioners stretched not so far,
and for that it grew also a case wherein judgment was to be given against one
of the courts of our parlaments: we willed and ordained that our court of
parliament of Paris (which is the first and principal court of all our
sovereign courts) should have the proceeding and trial thereof: and to that
end we made our letters pattents be dispatched the 21. of January, but it was
found, how the very day that the said first appellations (which were of the
said conclusion to burn, made at Cadenet, of the execution done in the person
of him which was shot thorough with harquebusies, of the forbiddance to give
no food) were pleaded by our said Proctor before our said Commissioners, and
that in pleading of the said appellations, the said Presedents, Minier, de la
Fond, de Tributijs and Badet, cou^cellors, stood principally to the points not
to receive, saying that they were the arrests and judgments of our court of
parliament of Prouence, and that by the letters pattents of our said late
Father, the said execution was allowed, so as he could not be received
appellant, but that his request and appellations were joined to the process
criminal, for that cause he presented another request, to be received
appellant of the said judgments or pretended arrests, as given by such as were
no judges, without ever hearing of the parties, upon simple requests of the
Proctors of our said late father, without cognoisance of the cause, and
containing unrighteous errors, cruelties and inhumanities, persisting to that,
that according to our said letters pattents, the said appellations might be
pleaded in the great Chamber of our Parliament of Paris, etc. For this cause it
is that we after having understood the quality of the fact, which is in
question, the scandale which was and is not only throughout this Realm, but
also strange countries, and to the end that in like sort as so miserable
executions having been done in the said places, were publicly done, so they
may be publicly repaired, if there be any faults, and the truth known not
only to our Judges, but also to all our Subjects and Strangers, who may
stand therein amiss conceived, as well as for the duty of justice, and
preservation of the memory of our said late L. and Father, have by these
presents, of our certain knowledge, full of puissance and royal authority,
euoked, and do euoke to our parson, the instance of the request made by our
said Proctor of the Queens Chamber, presented before the Judges of the said
chamber, and the appellations formed by him, of the executions done in the said
place of Merindol, and other Villages, upon which the parties have already been
heard before the said Judges, appointed to council, and joined to principal
process, to be anew pleaded, as the said requests and appellations being
inseparable, with the request and appellations a new cast in by our Proctor,
with the request likewise presented, tending to the end to be received, to
carry himself for appellant of the pretended judgments and executions of the
said letters pattentes above specified, and all the whole we have by these
said presents sent back, and do send back into our Court of Parliament of Paris,
in the said great Chamber of pleading, on the 20. day of May next coming,
there for to be publicly and with door wide open pleaded, and the parties
being heard, to ordain thereon what shall seem fit by reason.

So we command and ordain by these presents that the people of our Parliament
of Prouence, together the said Minier, De la Fond, Badet and Tributijs, and
others to whom it may appertain, be cited at the said day, to our said court
of Parliament at Paris, in the said great chamber of pleading, to maintain and
defend their said judgments and executions, and of the said letters pattentes,
and the proceedinges and other wrongs and greefes, and to see them repaired,
corrected and amended, if need so require; if not, to proceed further
according to reason, and to adiourne at the said day the said people of our
Parliament of Prouence, to appear in our said Court by Sindic or Proctor, who
shall be appointed by them to defend the said appellations, and answer to our
said Proctor, and likewise the said Minier, De la Fond, de Tributijs and
Badet, and other the adverse parties of our said Proctor if any there be;
commanding them that they be and appear, at the said day in our said
Court, if they see it needful, and that the said appellations may any ways
touch them or appertain unto them: making unto them such inhibitions and
forbiddances as are in such cases required, to which our said Court of Palament
of Paris, in the said chamber of pleading, of our special grace, full of
puissance and royal authority, we have (as is above said) attributed, and do
attribute, the cognoisance and decision of the said appellations,
notwithstanding any establishing of our said Parliament of Prouence, or any
appointments given by our said Commissioners, upon the request of our said
Proctor, joined to the criminal process, with the first appellations already
pleaded, wheerin we will not prejudice our said Proctor, and what other edicts
soever, commandments, restraints and forbiddances to the contrary
notwithstanding: from which, wherein it shall be needful, we have derogated and
do derogate of our said puissance and authority by these said presents; for
such is our pleasure.

Yeouen at Montereau the 17. of March, in the year of grace 1549. of our
Reign the 3. So by the King.
Sealed with the great seal of yellow wax, upon a single Lable.


These letters of euocation being signified, and the Parliament of Paris
possessed of the cause, there appeared in person the President Minier L. of
Opide, de la Fond, de Tributijs and Badet, and the overplus of the Parliament of
Aix by a Proctor. The cause was pleaded in the great Chamber of the Palace, by
the most famous advocates of that time, Riant was for the King, Robert for the
Judges of Prouence, Auberi for the^ of Merindol and Cabrieres, an other for the
Lady of Cantal, to the number of 12. and their pleadings and declarations
endured a long time, more then 50 hearings. Every man ran thither out of al
parts to hear such matters as never were heard the like, for excess of
cruelty: and albeit the Advocates of the Plaintifes part did not recite the
tenth part of that which was, yea rather dissembled the cause for which so
much innocent blood had been shed, yet so it was as all men were ravished with
a kind of astonishment, hearing so great and strange matters, an occasion that
every man expected a last judgment worthy of the matter, after such and so
long pleadinges, but in the end from so high mountains there can come out but
a very little smoke, which also very suddenly does euaporate it self into a
cloud out of the sight of men: the President Minier chief in all accusations,
having been a long time detained prisonner, attainted, and convinced of
whatsoever they would lay to his charge, in the end escaped their hands: Guerin
hanged at paris.
the Advocate Guerin being hanged at Paris, Minier found means not only to
escape, but also to be restored to his former estate, after having promised and
assured, that he would cleanse Prouence of these new Christians, yea and that
all his life long he would be revenged, for that by their occasion he was
driven so near his neck verse. Let us now look back into the desseines of K.
Henry, who prepared himself to lead an army, for the Protestants succor of
Germany against the Emperor.

The voyage of the army of Henry King of France, for the succor of the
protestant princes of Germany, against the Emperor Charles the fifth.
K. Henry 2. having assigned day and place to such forces as he would conduct
to the succor of the Germans against the Emperor, which amounted nere to
25000. Fantassins of French, 7000. Lanseknights, 1200. men of arms, with their
archers, two thousand light horse, and as many harquebusiers, mounted under the
Duke D'aumalle, went to hold his bed of justice in the Parliament of Paris,
where having admonished every man of his duty, advertised his subjects of his
enterprise, and made a number of ordinances as well for the reformation of
justice, as the discipline of war, and ordained the Admiral D'Anebaut Viceroy
throughout France, causing the Constable to march before with the auantgarde,
he passed on his way to Ginuille, where the Dowager of Lorraine presented her
self, to yield her self with her son, and the whole Duchy into his
protection, and also to excuse her self of some intelligences, Privileges of
Metz debated.
which it was reported she had with his enemies; afterward she retired
herself to Blamont: from Toulh the Constable auanced the army right to Metz,
the deputies whereof had until that time debated of their ancient privileges,
confirmed by a number of Emperors and Kings of France, offering
notwithstanding victualles to the whole army, without that any other saving the
K. with certain Lords might enter in: but the Constable who as the stronger,
would not debate such pretenses, by any other laws, then the right of the
Cannon, having limited unto them a day for their last answer, resolved to
enter therein with 2. Ensigns of 600. men, which being doubled, they were
found so long, that the first which were entered had means enough to repel the
inhabitants, Metz, Toulh, Verdun, Nancy, etc. taken by the French.
whilste that the rest entered peecemeale to assure that Town, the tenth day of
April to the Flower de lys: in the mean time that the King entered in arms
within Toulh, followed with his whole train, the Heralds of arms clad in
their Crimson velvet coats, azured, thick embrodered with Flowers de lys, with
their Trumpets, Privileges of the towns maintained.
Clarions, after having sworn to maintain their privileges, and reformed the
government and policy at his pleasure, he advanced forwards to Nancy chief
City of Loraine, where came forth to meet him, the young Duke, co^ducted by
the earl of Vaudemont his uncle, and sundry others. The K. having made his
entry as at Toulh, ordained there Vaudemant Governor of the Cuntry, to the
profit of the Duke, and having provided him of his estate, he sent him under
the charge of Bordillon to Reimes, where were the Dolphin and his brethren:
after going further, and approaching near Metz, he saw his army in this manner.
There were three square battles of Fanterie, The army of France represented
in the field, and first the Fanterie.
of which the first was of the old ensigns, paid and entertained in the time
of the late K. for the wars of Piemont, Champagne, and Boulogne, with other new
companies, levied in the beginning of these wars (without co^prehending
therein any soldiers of mark, or young gentlemen who were there for their
pleasure and without pay) to the number of between 15. and 16000. men, whereof
between nine and ten thousand were armed with Corselets, Bourguinots with
beuers, vambraces, gauntelets and tases, down to the knee, carrying long
staves, and the greatest part a Pistol at their girdle: and between a five
and six thousand harquebusers, armed with iacks and sleeves of mayle, with
rich Morions, and of goodly workmanship, a harquebuse or handgun, bright, well
polished and light, their furniture exquisite and brave, the rest being armed
according to the quality of their persons. The second battle was of
Gascoines, Armignacs, Basques, Bearnois, Languedois, Perigourdins, Prouenceaux,
and Auuergnacs: making show between ten and twelve thousand men, expert, and
used to the war, as well at Sea as land, whereof between eight and nine
thousand carried long staves, armed with corselets, and almane riuets, and two
or three thousand harquebusers, with mailes and morions. The third was of
Germans, to the number of 7. or 8. thousand, under the Count Ringrafe their
Colonel; men of war and assured, as they made good proof in their order,
and march of battle, well enough armed according to their manner, as well Pikes
as shot. The men at arms and light Caualierie.
Touching the men of arms, and light Caualerie, the whole was ordained by
ranckes upon the flancks of these battails, in number of 1000 or 1100. men at
arms, with the company of archers. The men at arms were mounted upon great
Roussins, or coursers of the realm, Turks and Ginets, with bardes of of such
colors in silk, as the Captains carried from the crown of their head to the
sole of their foot, with head pieces and pouldrons, the lance, the sword, the
dagger, the courtlasse, or the Mace, with reckoning their train of other
horses, whereon were their servants and grooms: over all which right well
appeared the cheeftaines and members of these companies, and other great Lords,
very richly armed with gilte, and cunningly engraued harness, upon
readiehorses, barde and caparisond, with bards and of steel, light and rich,
or else of strong mayle and light, covered over with Velvet, cloth of gold and
goldsmiths work, and Embroderers, with great magnificence. The archers lightly
armed carrying the half lance, the pistol at saddle pommell, the sword or
the courtlasse, mounted upon horses sturring, and curuetting at pleasure, among
which according to the power of each one, nothing was forgotten to set forth
himself, who should do best. Light Caualerie.
As touching the light Caualerie, there might be near 2003. light horse, which
were armed with corselets, vambraces, and bourguinots, the half lance or
pistol, the courtlasse, if it seemed good, or the Geldersword mounted upon
caualins, double courtals or horse well shaped and very swift. Harquebusiers
mounted.
The harquebusiers on horseback were between 12. and 1500. armed with iacks and
sleeves of maile, or curats, the Bourguinot, or the morion, the harquebuse of
3. foot long at the saddle pummel, mounted upon good courtals, every man
according to his ability, under the Duke of Aumaile, general of all the light
Caualerie. There was also 3. or 400. englishmen departed out of their country
to practice the war, under a certain Lord, upon geldings and little nags, swift
and prompt, Englishmen.
without being much armed, clad in short Ierkins and red caps, according to
their manner, and a lance like a half pike, which they very well know how to
handle, They are good men, desirous to know and exercise the wars, as such
have very well proved as have been with them. But as all men muzed much at the
sight of this army, even such as were appointed to keep the baggage, a number
of soldiers, servants and pesants, come out of Theonuille brake in, cheefely
on the side of the Lance-knightes, from whom they carried the better, before
people could be appointed to follow the^, which occasioned since many young
Frenchmen, especially of the light horse, to attache the garrison, and to try
themselves, against those of Theonuille with more pleasure and warlike exercise
notwithstanding, the^ harm that happened to the one part or the other.

The K. army before Metz.
The King having taken great pleasure at the order, equipage, behavior, and
salutation, which all they did unto him, commanded them to march continually in
battle, armed at all peaces, afterward he was saluted by his artillery,
placed a little above the army, within the vignes upon a platform: to wit, 16.
great Canons, 6. long Culuerines, 6. lesser, 12. bastard culuerins, the whole
conducted by D'Estre, great master and general of the artillery of France:
the next morrow the King entered into Metz, at the gate Champanoise, with great
magnificence under a Canapie, carried by four of the best Gentlemen of mark
in the Country, marching after the Officers, the Clergy before followed by
Cardinals, then the Constable barehead, armed at all peaces, bearing a naked
Sword before the King, who at the gate of the great Temple swear upon the
Evangelists to maintain them in their rights and ancient privileges: The K.
entry into Metz, and priueledges granted to the town.
after having given order to the government and fortifications, above all to
cut the town, to raise there a rampire upon the height of a mount, which
commanded, and having left Arthus de Cosse called Gonor, brother to the
Marshall Brissac governor, with 200. light horse, a company of ordinance,
twelve ensigns for the guard of victuals which from all parts was to come to
the army, he departed the 20. of April, after his Auantgare led by the
Constable: and leaving behind him in form of arreregarde, four hundred men
at arms, with a number of light horse, to advance and assure the rearegarde,
in like sort the three troops marched continually in battle, and all their
arms on their back, how dangerous a time and place soever they found. An
occasion that many, who before had lived at great ease and delicacie, died: and
many more for having drunk too much of those old waters, fell sick at their
return. The army rested two days in the fair and rich plain of Sauerne,
about the beginning of May 1552. to refresh the Soldiers, after the Caualiere
gave within one league of Strasbourg. In the mean season, and while the King
remained at Sauerne, to repose his army, and attend news from the Germane
Princes, they of Strasbourg wise by the example of the Messins, negociated with
the King, as well for the commodity of his army, The K. aprocheth to
Strasbourg.
as surety of their town: the King had already demanded them to provide
victuals for the army, and for that cause they deputed Pierre Sturme,
Gotessem, and Sleiden, who brought unto him great quantity of Come and wine,
but the Constable no whit regarded what they offered, by reason of the greatness
of the army: And albeit the Ambassadors were departed from him in such sort,
that they were to advertise the Senate, and after to yield him answer: yet the
very next morning he sent two gentlemen, The K, demand to them of Strasbourg.
by whom he pressed the^ to answer with a long discourse of the Kings good
will toward Germany, and for what cause he had entered into arms, and been at
so great a charge: to wit, to recover their liberty, now eslaued by the
Imperials, his other demand was, that by reason the men at arms, stood in
need of sundry things, that it might be lawful for them to buie them within
the town, and that it might be permitted to the artificers, to bring their ware
to the Camp, and sell it there: whereupon the Senate answered, that in matters
of so great importance, they were not accustomed to conclude of ought, but by
advise of the general council of all their Seignory, and that after having
consulted with them, they would send Deputies to declare their mind, so leave
being given them to depart, the next morrow, the same men were sent to the
Camp, which as yet remained at Sauernes. Their tale being heard, joined
thereto that they brought a little more munition then at first, and their
reasons set down why they might not suffer any men at arms to enter the
town, the Constable began to speak in choler: and in delivering how unjustly
they judged of the benefits of the King, and of the injuries of the Emperor,
he added certain biting terms, the end of his tale was that the next morrow
the King would speak with them in person, and confirm whatsoever he had
uttered. The same day the Ambassadors repaired to the King, with whom was the
Cardinal of Lorrain, the Prince of Vendosme, and the Constable, where they
recited as much as had been delivered by them to the Constable, at two parlies,
and presented unto him as much Oats as they had done before Wheat, and a
little more Wine; beseeching him that for the ancient amity which the signorie
of Strasbourg had with the King of France, and for his own courtesy, he
would take in good part their offer, the rather for that there was a great
Garrison within the Town, called thither for fear of surprise, and a great
number of Paisants were likewise retired thither out of the Country, which
caused the City not to be so well able to spare her provision. The King after
having conferred with his Council, began himself to repeat the cause which
made him come into Germany, in like sort as the Constable had the day before
delivered, how that victuals was a matter most necessary, and not to be denied
to any person in the ward, offering to pay for them, were he not an enemy,
otherwise if his stood in any need, he would find means to find it, cost as
it could, which would turn to a great damage, as every man might perceive. In
the mean time he refused nothing which was offered, but would needs have bread,
the Deputies on the other side besought him that he would be contented with
corn: as they could not fall to agreement, so away they went without doing
ought, the Deputies being returned into the Town, the Senate ordained, that
albeit they were not able to deliver any of the Corn within the town, yet
they should make bread in the Countries near hand, as much as they might be
able, for they had both told the King and the Constable, that the estate of
the town and disposition of the time was such, as they were not to tarry for
ought, but if they could reap any thing of the Countries about, they would
most willingly part with it. The which the Senate had ordained, to the end no
wrong might be offered to the people of their Villages, nor their goods, so
whatsoever could be found in any the Towns or Villages, was carried to the
Camp, but it was no great matter.

Now all Lorraine being surprised, together with the Town of Metz, Strasbourg
leuieth men* fortifieth it self by the e^^mple of Metz.
they of Strasbourg soddainely leauied five thousand men for the defense of
their town, afterward they pulled down many buildings, as well public as
particular, they spoiled the gardens, and rooted up the trees, and generally
all that which might either hinder the view or serve the enemies use, and of
that part which they esteemed most necessary, they fortefied the Town the best
that they were able: that without all doubt annoyed some of the French in such
sort, as the Constable could not hold his peace, the last time that he spoke
to the Deputies: and the Germans persuaded themselves, that as under a color
of some amity they had entered into Metz, so they would attempt the like at
Strasbourg, but knowing the town to be marvelous strong, and seeing all things
so diligently prepared for the defense thereof, they changed their minds as
they say; and the better to pass by the removing of their Camp, The Princes
deputies sent to the King.
they took the way of Haguenau and Wisbourg, thither the deputies of the
Prince Palatine, of the Archbishops of Maience and Treuues, of the Dukes of
Cleues and Witemberg, who had been assembled at Worms for the good of the
common wealth, came unto the King, whose request was, that he would not waste
the plain Country, and would take pity of the poor comminaltie, The
Germans be^^^^h the K. not to enter Germany* but retire.
and since that he protested that he had made this war for the liberty of
Germany, that he would stay his army, for that if he passed further, it would
be to the great damage of the Empire, they besought him then that he would
incline his heart to the making of a peace, of which as they had already spoken
to the Emperor, so would they again deal with him, having a good hope
thereof. As touching his demand of making an alliance between them, they
besought him to have regard to their honor and good renown, for that they
could not by any means perform, by reason of their faith, by which they were
bound to the Empire; notwithstanding they would employ all their endeavors to
the establishing of a public peace. Moreover they most affectionately
besought him not to endemnifie the territory of Strasbourge, which is a free
City of the Empire, and that at his request Albert Duke of Brandebourg, would
more courteously entreat the B. of Wicibourg. At the very same time, to wit,
the eleventh of May, Maurice sent letters to the King, wherein was contained
all that had been done at Lincy, where the confederate Princes of Germany had
entreated of certain articles of peace with Ferdinand, who negociated the same
for the Emperor, of whose part he had promised a good and prompt resolution,
for the benefit and quiet of all Germany. In like sort he required of the
King (whom he would should be comprehended in the same treaty of peace) that
he would set down under what conditions he would compound with the Emperor.
These letters being received contrary to his expectation, and knowing well that
the Queen of Hungary with troops of men of war, had taken Satenay, and
burned whatsoever she met without defense, judging besides of Maurices purposes
as he thought good, he determined of his return, so as having divided his army
into three parts, the better to conduct it with fewer disco^modities, and to
make it march by diverse ways, and yet arrive altogether at one place, he left
Germany; but before his departure he answered to the Princes Deputies, The K.
answer to the Deputies.
that he had obtained that, for which he was come into Germany with all his
army, for the Captive Princes should be delivered which was the occasion of the
war: he had then attained glory enough, if ever it should happen that
Germany should stand in need of him, he would neither spare travail nor
expense, nor would fail to put himself again into all dangers, for to
succor them; at this present he would retire into his own Realm with his
army, for he understood that the enemy did ouerrunne his Country. As
touching the complaints of the poor people, he received great displeasure
thereat, but discipline can never be so good in a Camp, but that military
license will breed some damage; for his own part he gave the best order that
he was able, that no man should be interessed, if not, yet the least that might
be, and that the offenders should be rigorouslye punished: As touching that
which they wrote of the Emperor, and of a peace, he referred himself to them;
through his travail, diligence and prowess, Germany stood now freed from
those miseries in which she stood enwrapped: henceforward it was for them to
look to it, that they did not villanously loose that liberty, which he so
honorably had rendered unto them, he could not deny their demand, on the
behalf of those of Strasbourge, albeit that at such time as he was with his
army upon their marches, many behaved themselves insolently and immodestly
toward his people; notwithstanding to entertain his confederates, and to have
a man always in Germany, which might assure him of the true estate of the
affairs, as they passed between the Imperialles and the confederates, and the
better to be advertised of the Emperors intents, he left Du Fresne B. of
Bayonne his Ambassador about Maurice, who did there as you shall understand,
after having represented unto you the estate, in which in the mean time stood
the armies of the Emperor, and of Maurice joined with his allies, together
with the conduct and last end of their enterprises; in which it shall be an easy
matter for you to judge, what favors and disaduantages the K. of France his
army brought to the one side and to the other.

We have before told you how Maurice was departed from Lincy, The exploits of
Maurices army upon the Emperors troops.
where they had articulated certain conditions of peace, Ferdinand suddenly
after the assembly, took his journey to Enipont toward the Emperor, to make
him understand the whole. In the mean time Maurice being come back to the
Camp, drew toward the Alps with his companions, where being egged forward by
the Ambassador of France, he determined to set upon those troops which the
Emperor had caused to be leuyed in that country, so as the 17. day of May
approaching near unto Fiesse, a Town situate at the entry of the Alps upon
the river Lech, and having vnderderstoode by his spies sent to descry the
countenance of the enemies, how they had seized on all the straites, and had so
ensconced themselves, as it was impossible to do them harm, he contented
himself to send certain of the cheifest, which galloped even to their Camp,
and took some, which they brought away with them, The princes gain the
straites of the mountains,
among whom they took Langue du Keste. The next morrow advancing forward with
the Infanterie, 200. men at arms, arrived at the straites of the mountains,
which about 800. of the Emperors soldiers kept with two field pieces, but
they quickly severed them, so as they being put to flight, sufficiently
astonished those which were nere unto Rute, the rather for that the Princes
following them foot by foot in such sort, set upon the rest, that they
defeated them, in killing about one thousand, and sundry other as well taken
as drowned within the River of Lech, with an Ensign there left behind.

The next morrow they battered the forte of Ereberge, with so good hap as they
took the fortress seated on the top of the Castle, thereby rendering
themselves masters of the Causie, and of the great Cannons which they found
there, which done they clambred up the mountain, strong and painful, even to
the Castle, albeit the bullets fell among them like hailestones,
notwithstanding which, it was for all that rendered up unto them, by 13.
Ensigns of foot, whereof nine were taken, The defeating of the Emperors
people.
and four saved themselves, and among them three were of Germans, and three
of Italians, about two thousand prisoners were led away, with some loss of the
other; this done, and as Maurice would have gained the Causey, the soldiers
over whom Rifeberg had charge, refused to go on any further, Sedition in
Maurices Camp.
except they might receive extraordinary wages, by reason of the taking of
Ereberg: whereupon having caused one of the seditious persons which cried out
highest to be taken, the rest did not only bend their Pikes against him, but
many in like sort shot a number of bullets at him out of Harquebuses, in such
sort as he hardly saved himself: in the end notwithstanding the Chiefetaines
appeased all, and the 21. of May, two regimentes were sent by the Alps to
Enipont, which was but two days journey thence, the Cauallerie remaining with
a regiment of Fantassins about Fiesse and Rute, to keep the passage: The
Emperor flies.
then Maurice and the Princes allied, followed the next morrow, and joined
with the Infanterie near Ziole, distant from Enipont two leagues; an occasion
why the Emperor having received news of the winning of Ereberge, departed
from Enipont in the night in great haste and much trouble, with his brother
Ferdinand, who was come thither but a little before to persuade a peace, as
has been told you, so as by keeping the way of the mountains on the left
hand, which leads to Trent, The D. of Saxe delivered out of prison, but
follows the Emperor throughout Germany.
he retired himself to Villac a town of Cornia upon the Diane: he likewise
had set at liberty a little before that, John Frederic Duke of Saxe, whom he
had caused to be shut up in prison five whole years together, and now
released him, for fear least the enemy should arrogate the same to his glory,
which likewise the captive was not himself desirous of: being at liberty, he
notwithstanding accompanied the Emperor whether soever he went.

Maurice being arrived at Enipont, whatsoever was found left of the Emperors
stuff, or appertaining to any of the Spaniards, or to the Cardinal of
Ausbourg, was pilled, but no harm was offered to the goods of Ferdinand, nor of
the Citizens: And for so much as there rested then but three days of the
truce, which had been accorded in respect of the future treaty, Maurice went
from thence to Passau, but the princes his companions, returned back the same
way they came, and rendered themselves at Fiesse the 20. of May; and afterward
published letters at Ausbourg, as well in their own name as in Maurices, in
these terms.

The confederate Princes letters against the Emperor, for religion, and the
liberty of Germany.
WHereas in our former wrightings we have affirmed that our entrance into
arms, was for the defense of religion, and the liberty of Germany, the matter
it self and our bound duty does require that we ordain sufficient Doctors for
the Churches, and instruction of youth, for it is most clear and has not any
need of more ample proof, how the enemies of the truth have ever employed all
their force to destroy the good Doctors, thereby to establishe their Popish
Idol, and cause youth to increase therein, being nourished in these errors,
and false doctrines, for even at that instant when they durst not publicly
speak their minds of religion, they then studied by all means to root out at
the very bottom all true doctrine, and not only have they imprisonned the
good doctors, Ministers and Schoolemasters restored by the Protestant princes
in Germany.
but likewise in this very town unlooked for, and with great inhumanity have
they constrained them by oath to depart out of the whole teritorie of the
Empire: and albeit that this oath be most wicked, and not grounded upon any
right or equity, yet to take away all occasion of detraction, we have revoked
the self same Ministers and Schoolmasters which our adversaries had chaced
hence: wherefore we declare all those absolved, which have been cast out by
means of the band wherewith they stood bound through their oath: we restore
them to their full liberty, with commandment that not only in this city,
but also in all other places they preach the word of God purely, and according
to that confession which has been here at other times presented, and teach
their youth rightly and holesomelye in good learning, relying upon our succor
and protection. We forbid in like sort, that none taunt the^ with any
injurious word, as if they had done ought against their faith and oath,
considering that without any deserte, but merely for confession of the truth,
that they have already lived many months in exile, we make no doubt but good
men will greatly pity them, and esteem them worthy of being succored and
relieved with all favor. And for so much as those which in the absence of the
other have taught in this City, be men suspected and unconstant, so as by
reason of their diverse fashion of teaching they may not be commodiously with
those which we have called home. We require the Senate to take from them the
chair, and to carry themselves in such sort as this our present Edict may
remain in force.


After that the Princes had published these letters the 7. of June, five days
after they installed again the Protestant Ministers in their places, and gave
them again a great charge to preach, to the wonderful rejoicing and pleasure
of the people.

Maurice went his way in the mean time to Passau to entreat of peace, where
the first of June all that had been handled at Lincy was repeated, Maurice his
complaint against the Emperor.
and the whole matter set down and explaned at large by Maurice. There were
present the Emperors ambassadors, King Ferdinand, Albert D. of Bauiere, the
Bishops of Salisbourg and Deistet, and the Ambassadors of all the Princes
Electors of Cleues, and of Witemberg. Maurice greatly complained how the common
wealth of the Empire, which ought to be the freest of all other, was governed
by strangers, how the authority of the Princes Electors, was from day to day
diminished, how many things were done without ever once demanding their
advice, how sundry appertinances were dismembered, and clean aliened from the
Empire, and the means sought how their right might be utterly taken away from
the choosing of the Emperor, how in the imperial days for the most part they
left behind the opinions of the Electors, how the particular assemblies of the
Electors remained there, I know not with what fear how their jurisdiction
diminished, for so much as contrary to the ancient custom the Chamber
received the griefs and complaints of those, which were the appellants of that
which they had ordained: the differents of the estates of the Empire were
thereby increased, and could not be pacified until both parts were greatly
interessed, how it grew to too great an expense and trouble, but to have
audience in the Emperors Court, for that causes could not ordinarily be
throughlye understood, for want of well understanding the language: how not
only great charge grew thereof, but much time there spent without any profit;
how at the imperial days there was small amitye, for if any one proposed
ought for the benefit of the common wealth, it was strait construed in the
worst part, how Germany drew it self clean dry through these so often and long
assemblies, and in the mean time many things went to rack at home, and yet
for all that the public estate waxed not better but worse, and still enwrapped
in more miseries, how it was forbidden by a rigorous Edict, that none should be
entertained in wages by strangers, how such as are reconciled are bound not to
carry arms against any of the Emperors provinces, and by that means are
separate from the Empire; how those which in the war of Smalcade served but
their own Lords, were condemned in great fines, and how they levied money in
like sort of those, which during the said war continually remained in the
amitye of the Emperor, yea upon pain of seeing their goods sold before their
eyes, except they made a quick dispatch; and because their Deputies accorded
together, incontinently proclamation was made that they should depart from the
Court upon pain of death; how often they had brought strangers, men at arms
into Germany, and after the last watre dispersed them throughout the provinces,
where they committed a thousand villainies and disorders, and bragging how they
had tamed Germany, and boasted that she should be annexed to the Emperors
patrimony, and how in the chief and principal Cities should be erected
fortes and bulwarks to bridle them in, how as it were in mockery, they carried
out of Germany to strange nations great quantity of pieces of artillery, and
furniture of war; how some for extreme covetousness of vain glory, have
engraued in such pieces as they caused to be new cast, the arms of the
Princes of Germanye, as who would say that they had won them from them; how
they had imprinted little books, yea with privilege of the Emperor, to the
great dishonor of Germany, as if she had been utterly tamed and brought into
bondage; how at public assemblies some were received to the number of the
Princes and estates, under the name of the Emperors provinces, which was
craftily done, to the end that the number being increased, they might gain
their wills by multitude of voices; how four years passed they had erected a
Parliament of the Chamber, and how laws were priuatelye made by some, and since
published not without the great damage of a number, and especially of those, of
the religion of Ausbourg, for they gave unto them no place at all in this
assemblye; it is then most necessary, said he, that the laws should be
examined at the very first assembly, Maurice proposed these things and sundry
other more, requiring to have them amended, considering how they touched the
Empire, and that the Empire might be restored to her ancient brightness, and
that it might not be lawful for other to scoff them or despise them: the
Commissioners after having consulted together, judged that these demands
contained nothing in them but great equity, and yet to the end the Emperors
honor might be preserved, and that himself might the rather be persuaded
thereunto, they were of opinion that many matters which concerned the
reformation of the public estate might very well be reserved to an imperial
day.

There was also Du Fresne the French Ambassador, who made his oration in full
audience of all the Princes, The French Ambassadors oration.
the 13. of June, saying: That in old time and long before ever the name of
French was heard of among men, there had been so great a conformity of life
between the Gaulois and the Almans, that at other times they were called by
the Latins, Germans, as brethren to the Gaulois: but after that the French had
seated themselves in Gaul, the two nations were so united together, that it was
one self same Empire, under the same Prince and the same laws. Afterward as
in change of time the empire was transferred to Germany, so did the Saxons and
other Emperors always entertain amity with the French, for because they
were descended from the Kings of France: in such sort as Philip Augustus
caused to be engraued in letters of gold, that ancient alliance which was as
it were clean abolished thorough antiquity, and to be set up in the most
holy place, and not without cause, for whilst that this conjunction endured,
the commonwealth of both the people flourished, and the force of Germany was so
great, as it gave laws not only to the Hungarians, Bohemians, Pollakes and
Danes, but also to the very Italians: and the Kings of France in like sort
curious to amplify Religion, did often bear arms against Sarazins, Turks,
and other enemies of Christendom, through Asia, Africa, and Europe, in
atchiuing of most glorious victories. Since that, we are come in a more
unhappy age, when as some Emperors as it were engraffed in, and not of the
natural stock of Germans, and unworthy of their estate, have clean
abandoned this amity of the Kings of France: whereupon there ensued great
misfortunes in the Common wealth. But this soar was healed by the grace of
God, by means of the noble families of the Princes of Luxembourg, out of which
some Emperors descended, men of high renown, and great friends to the Kings
of France, for the Father of Charles the fourth died in fighting for the King
of France. The Princes of Austria have been in like sort affected, among
whom Albert the first could not possibly be induced by any of the Popes
promises or threats, to make war against France, which he recited to the
end it might be understood, how ill some of the familiars and and servants to
the most puissant emperor Charles the fifth order the common wealth, not only
seeking by all their travel to disioyne these two most excellent Nations the
one from the other, but before this thorough their subtilties and wilines they
have prevailed so far, as the most famous Prince King Frauncis was condemned
for an enemy without being heard. It is true that that redounded to their
particular profit, but to the great damage of the Commonwealth, for it may
evidently enough be perceived, how hard a matter it is to decay the liberty of
Germanye, and to build their Realm to make it last so great and so long, as
the amity between these two nations has endured, for because at this present
standing in fear of the French armies, they proceed therein more slackely,
and insist not so lively to impose their Spanish yoke: they be they for
certain, which have obtained peace at the Turks hands, by prayers and
tributes, and who under color of Religion and obedience, have brought a
thousand enormities and factions into Germany, which have beaten her with her
own rod, warring against her with her own power, which have drawn money
from all, and rendered the condition of Germany into so pitious an estate, as
may be well seen by the Spanish Garrisons, disposed on the one side and the
other, which have unfurnished those places of arms where they were kept in
store, which have made open the way to the examination of the treasure, for it
is grown to that pass at this day, that the seal of the Empire, and the
judgment of the Chamber, and the right or privilege of imperial days, is in
the sleeue of the B. of Arras, for what means this, to execute by way of
justice, or to banish in offering great rewards to the murderers? all those,
as for their maintenance, have put themselves into the wages of strangers; I
omit so many murders, so many whordomes, pilferies, and sackings of Cities,
and above all religion; which now was handled of one sort, and now of another,
accordingly as the time served. Certes whatsoever has been done since some
years passed, has tended to no other end then to trouble the laws of the
Empire, or constrain or allure King Ferdinand by fair promises, as also to
terrify the Princes by fears and dreades, to the end the Prince of Spain
might be chosen Emperor: were it not rather to be wished by men of valor, to
dye then to see the light of the Sun in such miseries and calamities? I do
not think that any man can be found so blockish or barbarous, that he does not
feel himself galled with these things. Therefore no man ought to marvel, if
at the last some Princes have been found, and among them the Electour Maurice
D. of Saxe, which stand resolved to hazard their lives for the recovery of the
liberty of their common Country, and which finding themselves too feeble, and
not able alone to sustain the charge, have demanded succor and alliance of
the King of France, who clean forgetting any mislikes of the time passed,
has not only employed thereto all his wealth and treasure, but also has not
spared his own person in a matter of so great consequence: contracting an
alliance with them, wherein among other things there is set down, that they
shall not make any accord with the enemy, without the Kings good liking: and
albeit that Maurice be bound thereunto, yet desiring the prosperity of the
Country, and to accommodate himself to Ferdinand, which did so earnestly
require it, he very lately besought the most christian King, to signify unto
him, under what conditions he would have the peace treated of: that, to say
the truth fell out otherwise then he hoped for, considering his benefit
toward them to have been such and so great, that he thought it fitter to
entreat nearer hand, and not so far off, of matters which so nearly
concerned him: nevertheless for so much as he ever preferred the public weal
before his own particular, he would deny nothing to a Prince his allie:
wherefore if the soars of the common wealth might be healed as they ought, and
that good assurance may be given that in time to come they shall not be
refreshed; if the Captive Princes may be released under the conditions set
down in the treaty, further if the ancient alliances between France and the
Empire, and the last Capitulation with Princes, may be so confirmed, as that
for ever they may remain in force: if these things I say may be well
brought to pass, he is so affectionate to the Common wealth, that not only he
will willingly accord to a treaty of peace, but also yield most humble thanks
to God, that herein he has aided you with council, and succors. As touching
private matters, as the Emperor has detained from him many things by force,
and made war upon him without any just occasion; the King thinks it a
matter very reasonable, that he which has been the occasion of the injury,
should first show the way of satisfaction. The King in truth no whit
distrusteth at all of his own power, nor yet of the equity of his cause, and
notwithstanding he will give them to understand how much he loves peace; and
how much he desires to agree with them all, and with Maurice.

The Princes answered hereunto, that his discourse fet from antiquity, The
confederate Princes answer to the French Ambassador.
as concerning the conjunction of Germany and France, was most agreeable unto
them, and no less that the King preferred the common wealth before his
particular profit, making no refusal to the confederate Princes accord with
the Emperor, for it is not only the profit of one nation,, but of all
Europe, which having been turmoyled with civil calamities, tended to an
evident ruin. As for the conditions which the K. demanded, they doubted not
but that they might be obtained, for the Emperor always bare good will
toward the common wealth, both heretofore and in these present troubles, he
never understood that the liberty of Germany was any ways diminished. There
was likewise great hope that in very short space he would set at liberty the
Captive Princes. As touching the renewing of their ancient alliances; the King
well understands in his own wisdom, that a matter of so great weight could
not be brought to pass in this assembly: notwithstanding they greatly desired
that the amity which ever had been between the two nations might remain
firm and inviolable: they likewise desire above all the rest, that the
differentes between the King and the Emperor might be pacified, protesting
that therein they would neither spare travail not diligence whatsoever. But
for so much as the K. said that the Emperor did possess sundry places which
appertained to him, and openly made show of many which he would repeat; it
seemed unto them a matter very reasonable, that he should declare what they
were, for they were determined fullye to infourme the Emperor thereof, and to
be a means in the cause. Further they besought the King to take the same in
good part. Family of Luxembourg.
That which the Ambassador spoke of the familye of Luxembourg grew upon this:
Henry Earl of Luxembourg had a son named Henry, who afterward was the
seventh Emperor of that name, he had a Son named John, who by manage was
King of Bohemia, and gave succors to Philip de Valois against Edward the third
King of England, being present himself in person at the day of battle; but
there remained he, for that the Englishmen had the better. Among other he left
Charles his eldest Son, who afterward was the fourth Emperor of that name,
Father unto Wenceslaus and Sigismond, who both came after to be Emperors, and
the latter was likewise King of Hungary and Bohemia, Albert of Austria.
and solicited the council of Constance Albert of Austria of whom he spoke,
was Emperor son to Raoul the Emperor, who always entertained good amity
with Philip le Bell, King of France, albeit that Boniface the eight, enflamed
him as much as possibly he could to make war. But it is now time to look back
to the French.

I have told you how the King of France being come as far as Strasbourge,
with an army of thirty thousand men, for the succor of the Protestant
Princes against the Emperor, afterward resolved of his return, understanding
of the Peace concluded between the Germans, had divided the body of his
forces into three parts, to make them to march sundry ways the easier, and
with less discommoditie of victuals; The Q. of Hungary causes the K. army to
return.
and especially to encounter the sooner the Q. of Hungaries army, which she had
to the borders of Cha^pagne. This Princess knowing how the affairs of the
Emperor her brother, went but even hardly by reason of those occasions which I
have made you to understand: and above all that this French army would prove a
cross girde to his intents, determined to retarde the same by such troops as
she could leuy throughout the low countries, which would be in such sort
able to prejudice the realm; as the K. should be enforced to return for
succor of the same; and so having solicited Martin Vanrosse, the bastard and
Marshall of Cleues she caused him to come down into the duchy of Luxembourg,
with 3000. soldiers of Cleues, Valois, and Geldres, The Imperials army in
Luxembourg.
assisted with 600. horse, all which being joined with Count Mansfielde, the
governor of the Duchy, the Bailife of Auanes, the Governors of Cimetz, and
other chieftanes, made up the number of 12000. Fantassins, and 3000. horse,
with which they determined to enter into France, and there to do the worst
they should be able; they took Satenay upon the Meuse, by a Lorraine Captains
voluntarye deliuerye thereof, which the Dowager of Lorraine had left there
without other Garrison; where suddenly they employed themselves to repair the
breaches, and to restore it into his former estate, building of a bulwark
behind on the side of Dun le chasteau, and a platform toward La justice. Now
upon the brute that they meant to assail Villefranche, Bourdillon went in with
seauenteene horse, and the same night made his company of men at arms to enter
in, with as many men and provisions as he was able, but being advertised how
they changing of their opinion were determined to return to Mouson, he left
Chastellus his Lieutenant at Villefranche, issued from one of the ancient
houses of Burgundy, with such full authority as the Queen, and the Admiral
D'Anebaut had given unto him to command there; and with the rest of his
company entered at break of day into Mouson, where Roche de Maine was with his
company of men at arms, and the three hundred Fantassins of the Barons of
Cerny; but if the cheifest sort did not agree, much more were the inhabitants
perplexed through the feeblenes of the place, commanded by a high mountain
near unto it, notwithstanding any rampire which they were able to make to
cover it: besides, that the principal of the town had already trust up their
baggage; Bourdillon notwithstanding having assured them of the Kings coming at
hand, and having caused his cobbarde, and other more precious moueables to be
brought in, and swearing not to abandon them, they a little assured themselves.
The Imperials for all that being saluted with the Cannon shot of
Villefranche, and councelled not to remain there, crept along the river, as
far as the village of Brioles, where they burned the Church and the forte,
then to Mont-faucon which they burned, and so descended into the plain, to put
men into the Castle of Boulandre, which they took, by stealth getting of
victuals and provisions, which they carried to Satenay: from thence all along
the river they sacked sundry villages as far as Grampre, a little Town upon
Air, near Chalons and Atigni, where they rested: and understanding how the
Admiral having put the Legionaires of Champagne in arms, and united the
Zuizers with the French men of war, approached near; they set fire on
Grampre, Boulandre, and other places, to retire themselves to Satenay, where
they had intelligence that the light horse of the Kings army who advanced
forward, were already at Luxembourg: an occasion that to retire themselves,
they all abandoned it, leaving the most part of those of Cleues and Geldres,
for the assurance of Yuoy, if any should go about to force it. King Henry in
the mean time, who heard the complaints of these miserable Subjects, the
sooner to hasten the revenge, The K. army aduanceth forward.
put out of his army almost all the sick persons, and left the baggage under
the conduct of the Earl of Arraine, and Visdome of Chartres with their
companies, and some light horse, and Harquebusers mounted, for the conueying
thereof into Metz, or any other place which they should think more assured:
afterward the discamping of the imperials being known, and the immoderate
diligence used at the retiring of his troops, the conquest of the duchy of
Luxembourg was deliberated of and resolved to annex it unto the crown, as a
proper succession fallen to the house of Vendosme, by the death of the
Constable S. Paul, true Lord and peaceable possessor thereof, in carrying the
name and arms, as the authors of that council maintained, albeit that since
that time Charles Duke of Burgondie had ever usurped the same, the rather for
that many neighbors therabouts said that it was the very true refuge of
thieves and outlawes, therefore did the army draw right to the Castle of Roc
de Mars, all along the Mozelle between Treues and Theonuille, seated on the
steep of a hill, strong enough for situation and fortification, with a little
Town beneath it, under the title of Viscount. The Castle summoned made
refusal, for a number of Gentlemen, Ladies, and other neighbors of
reputation, were retired thither, imagining that the King would first employe
his forces against Theonuille, and that at all assaies they might ever be
received at an honorable composition after the first brunte. But the King
contrariwise was councelled to attempt that, in respect of the victuals and
provisions which the army so much wearyed should there find, and that the
sacking thereof might rather be given to the Soldiers, how Theonuille was too
strong and well provided, What place the army was first to attempt.
to be gotten in so short time, which they were not any ways to consume but
with assured profit, how thereby they should loose the occasions of executing
other things, how in the mean time they would fortefie the rest of the places
with all commodities: besides how Theonuille stood between Metz and that
Castle, which they might so repair, as the Garrison of Theonuille should be
blocked in, and their provisions clean stopped, which would be a means that
in the end it should likewise be rendered up to the French, with less charge,
less loss of time, and less hazard: six Cannons were planted on the hill
for batterye, two Culuerins battered against the wall, where there was but one
gross square tower for a flanker, and the Portall which served for another.
After between the town and the Castle was dressed a battery beneath, right
against a great Tower and a canton of the wall, so as they within besieged,
feeling the shaking of the Towers and walls, were not hard to Parley. But the
Soldiers having the sacking promised unto them, fearing least a Parley would
cause a voluntary rendering, and never tarrying other volley of the Cannons,
leapt into the ditches, which were deep, high, and broad, Roc de Mars
besieged, battred, taken and sacked, by the French.
whereof some clambering up, others mounting with their Pikes to the wall,
while the rest were with wood and fire at the gates, so greatly astonished the
besieged, that all retired themselves into Caves, Chambers, Sellers, and other
secret places, to shun death, which was even before their eyes; especially
after that some French men having found and broken open the gate of a Posterne
which went out of the base Court into the Ditch, had made themselves to be
perceived and feared on al parts, for that as soon as being mounted, they gave
entrye to all the rest, which had no regard but to throw down, rifle, and
take all. At such time as the Earl Ringraue Collonell of the Germans, who did
not imagine the taking thereof upon such a soddaine, went to beseech the King
in consideration of all his services, to spare unto him that place, the Lady
whereof was his near Kinsewoman, which the King granted unto him, commanding
Coligny to cause the Soldiers to retire. Afterward Mont S. Iean, Solieure,
and other places were sacked and burned, during the continual and fresh
skirmishes between the French and Imperialles before Theonuille; from whence
the army being passed Estain, turned face to take again the way of D'anuille,
about which was already the Admiral d'Annebaut, with the Legionaires of
Champaigne, 4. thousand Suizers, and 200. horse, with which he had already
hindered such succors, as Marcy governor of that place attended from his
partakers: it is in a place plain and fennie, but the hot season dry through
the Solstice of the Summer, Deanuille represented, besieged, battred, and
rendered to the K. discretion^
was so favorable to the approches of the French, that two thousand
Fantassins, and 3. hundredth light horse since named Carabins, nor the Cannon
shot could have hindered the Artillerye from being planted on the top of the
Castle ditche toward the Medowe, without the battery from a little hill, of
six Culuerines, to bar and annoye such defenses as it was very ill provided
of, albeit it was made at pleasure, to the end it might be impregnable: The
K. entry into Verdun.
during these approches, the King made his entrye into Verdun, albeit it was
full of the sick persons of his army, and after that the Cardinal had
feasted him at Dinner within the Bishops Palace, he returned to view the
batterye, which lasted from the fourteenth to the sixteenth of June, making two
breaches, whereof one was toward the river, and the Castle ditche was for all
that full of water the height of a Pike, and above that they were feign some to
ascend more then a fadome and a half: but as the Fanterye presented
themselves at the assault, those which were within refused of any composition,
rendered themselves in the end to the discretion of the King, which was that
the chief and principal persons should remain Prisonners, that the Soldiers
should depart with white sticks down, having full liberty to go whether it
pleased them best, the goods should remain to the Kings use, which he
afterward bestowed (the artillery reserved) upon the Earl of Coligny called
Chastillon, whereat the Soldiers began to murmr, seeing themselves frustrate
of the sack of both those places, being ill apparelled and little in their
purses by reason of their long voyage, and the most part of them very sick.
The Captain Villefranche one of the cheifest men of mark among the old
bands had the government, but having been hurt there with a Musket shot,
he died: and Le Bruil a Bourgonian Gentleman, before Liuetenant to Salsedo,
had his company, and Rabodanges the government.

Whilste that the King with promise of honorable entertainment received the
Prince of Salerna, who greatly grew discontented with the Emperor, the
Constable having understanding how the Earl Manfielde was gotten into Yuoy,
whereof Strinchant was Governor, sent to block him in with two thousand foot,
The Prince of Salerne quitting the Emperor comes to the King.
and a number of horse, to hinder any goings forth or entries in: after the
rest encamped there, the Earl showing himself a great husband of his
provisions, and causing no sallye to be made forth, which proved not very
hurtful to the French. The Town is situate at the foot of a Mountain, Yuoy
and his representation, siege, battery and yielding up to the K.
and on the other side is a medowe, and a fair spacious plain, along the
which runs La Chesse, a little River which comes toward D'anuille,
swelling greater hard by with many other brooks which fall into it:
afterward it comes into Meuse near Sedan. The greatest part of the
Garrison was of Germans, Cleuois, and Geldrois, not accustomed to abide great
famine nor long thirste, no more then to sustain other discommodities of such
sieges, with the Earls company of 100. men at arms, and 500. horse, as well of
the Gentlemen about; was of these Carabins, and Harquebusiers mounted. They
very well performed their duties by ordinary sallies, and right sharp
skirmishes to hinder the aproches of the artillery: but in the end it was
planted in 2. places, as near the brinke of the ditch of Mouson side against a
little Canton of a wall, which only remained of the rampire, the height of 3.
fadome and somewhat above, which battered in point blanck. They had set upon
the hill 6. culuerins, which spoiled all the streets and the length of the
courtins, right on the back of the breach, so as those within besieged, not
seeing any walk sure for them, without being scarred, and so near their ears
that the hear remained there, lost their courage, and being with one consent
assembled under the hale and with them the brauest of the company, albeit that
the greatest breach could not hold fifteen men in front, besides their
trauerses, trenches, trains, chanssetraps, fricasses, and other devices proper
for the defense of a breach: and albeit that the Earl were armed and ready of
his charge, declared unto them their duty, the valewe and renown of the
Germane nation, with the dishonor and loss as well of life as goods, which
would ensue so cowardlye a resolution, would make no other answer, but that if
the French did assail him before, they would dispatch him behind. In sum,
seeing them the far stronger, and notable but to curse his life, and detest
his ill hap; he set a French Gentleman at liberty, to be a witness of his
duty. Afterward being retired with salt tears into his Chamber, Strinchant
made a Trumpeter go upon the side of the trenches to demand a parle of the
Constable, which being granted, Strinchant went out hoping of some
aduantagious capitulation, which could be no other then that of D'anuille, so
the Earl having learnedly and eloquently (as he was very well studied in
learning, with the knowledge whereof he honored the profession of arms)
bewailed his misery unto the Constable, was with the rest of the chief carried
to Paris. A notable example said some of the French, for all such as reposing
themselves in any prosperity passed, or in the merit of their own valor,
consider not that the duty of a Captain is so inseparably joined, to theirs
which obey him, that he ought to stand no less assured, and before the blow
come, provide for the same as well as his own, The Governor of a place his
duty.
except he would fall into the like inconvenience that this Earl did. All the
goods of Yuoy which were very great, were given unto the Constable, who
distributed the greatest part unto his own company, and his sons
Montmorency, at which the old bands openly mutined, and after that began to
break themselves, and to quit their Ensigns. So the Town being rendered up
the three and twentieth day of June, received Blaineau, afterward Haucourt for
Governor. Mommedy (which rendered it self life and Jewels saved) had the
Captain Baron a Parisian, Mommedy yielded up.
a young Soldier, but old enough in warlike experience, with a hundred horse
and three Ensigns, D'anuille, Yuoy, Mommedy, Luxembourg; and the most part of
the Duchy, had been before taken by Charles D. of Orleans, third son to
Frauncis the first, and after rendered again by an agreement between the King
and the Emperor; The first conquest of Luxembourg.
but they were not then in so good state, D'anuille was as then but a little
borough Town, and since all burned, and after reedified according to the
fortifications at this day, with Bulwarks, Bastions, and platformes of
defense, the rampires large and high, De An^ille.
and of good hold, the whole new repaired with walls of good stuff. Yuoy.
Yuoy was strong, and not taken by assault, neither was there any reasonable
breach made to enforce it; but the Captain Guelphe having invented, and
himself made a great quantity of Mortier pieces, which shot exceeding great
bullets from the hill down, so greatly astonished them, that Gilles de Leuant,
chief for the Emperor yielded himself, life and jewels, saved with some
artillery.

During the siege of Yuoy, the Marshall of Sedan heir to the house of La
March, besought the King that he would help him to recover his Duchy of
Bouillon, which he said the Emperor unjustly detained from him, The Marshall
of Sedan heir to the house of La March, undertakes the conquest of the duchy
of Bouillon.
at the persuasion of the B. of Liege, who gave unto him 4000. men and five
pieces of artillery, wherewith he battered the castle of Bouillon, which was
seated upon a high and steep rock, going out of a mountain, from which it
was separate by a broad ditch and deep, of an hundred and fifty pace, in
diameter, made by chisell and hammer with long travel; in the plain and
circumference whereof, the better part of the Castle is hewn out within the
maine Rock, with like workmanship almost in form of Ouall, having on the
dich side a platform so high, as it almost ouertoppeth one of the Mountains:
at the foot whereof is a form of Casemate well perced, to keep it from any
aproches: on the other end is the Portall which goes out of every side
fifteen foot, with lights to keep the flankers, and which serve for the
platform, within it is a core of ancient building, in form of a square
Pauillion, covered with slate, which underneath has his sellers vauted within
the very rock, with an excellent good Well of fourscore fadomme, the Castle is
perced to so good purpose, that a Chicken cannot peep up in any place, but it
will be discovered; furnished with artillery and all other provisions for a
long season, receiving but one way unto it, and that very narrow and painful,
the borough is underneath, in time past a fair town, but so torn asunder by
the wars, that it remains almost uninhabited. Semoy which comes toward
Mommedy, runs there with a mighty fall of stream, especially when it
swells, by reason of the Winter raines and snowes, on the one side it is
shadowed with another Mountain, full of woods and craggie rocks, so sharp
that it is almost impossible to dwell there, not to hurt the Castle on that
side, not able to bring any Cannon, the rest of the places are very low
valleys and dangerous. The Marshall notwithstanding to make his troops appear
greater then indeed they were, made his companies to pass and repasse many
times in one self same place, to make it be thought that the whole French
army was there assembled: afterward he planted his pieces upon the
Mountain, but so uneasily as they were feign to bind them hard with great and
huge Cables for fear of tumbling down, A wile to make ones troops seem
greater and astonish the enemy.
from whence there was not above six volleis shot, having only a little
scratte the top of the wall with small appearance of any breach, when as the
Captain Bastard of the house of Haurion, very ancient in that Country,
besought a Parley, and obtained pardon: so as if he had no succor within
three days, he should yield up the place, (life and goods saved) the
artillery and other munitions there reserved, and his son in hostage. The
three days being expired, he departed with his Liegers, the Marshal confessing
that he had undertaken this conquest at an adventure. Likewise the Captain had
his head afterward struck of, for his so good service, Bouillon was yielded
up the very last day of thirty years that the Duchy had been out of the
hands of the right heirs, and afterward the Marshall easilye recovered all
the appendances, and having left there Des Auelles with a good Garrison, he
returned to thank the King for this so great a benefit: upon this the army
drawing toward Cinets, and de Lumes being dead, the Castle of Lumes was
delivered up to Vielle-uille, Lieutenant to the Marshall S. Andre by
Merembarque, who kept the same for the imperials, the fortes whereof were
undermined and thrown down, no more remaining but the dungeon, which the King
gave with part of the confiscation of this rebellious vassale to the D. of
Neuers, and Earl of Retel, and the rest to De Conflant a French gentleman, who
had married the Niece true heir of the Lord, the Castle is at the foot of a
Mountain, where the river of Meuse runs by it, and on the other side a
fair Medowe, half a league from Mezieres, to which it had done many shrewde
turns, because the Lord pretended certain rightes, besides that it was a
retraite to all lewd persons, an occasion that Frauncis the first had there
builded a blockhouse, which for all that served to no purpose by means of the
evil government thereof. The Lord of which had been brought up a Page in the
Kings house, and ever held the French party, until that upon some spite he
changed for the Bourgonion cross, with which he dyed of the shiuer of a piece
which he tried: afterward the King being determined of his return, and
having made the D. of Niuernois Governor of Luxembourg, all also furnished Roc
de Mars, and the other places with all necessaries, notwithstanding the daily
roades of Theonuille, and other imperial places, sent his army to batter,
take, and cut in pieces; all those that were retired into the Castle of Trelon,
Cimetz battered, taken, sacked, and burned by the French.
which was undermined and raised, as Glaion and other places: and to content
the old Ensigns, the sack of Cimetz was bestowed on them, a Town and Castle
of the Duke of Ascottes, whither many of the Country and of Ardennes were
retired, with cheifest goods of valewe: but seeing the batterye, they clean
left the town, and ran into the Castle, the great Tower whereof was no
sooner battered down; but those that were besieged being willing to parley,
were knocked down by the Portail and other places, where they found an
entrance to sack and rifle, with so great greedines and indiscretion, as
within one of the tower vautes where the Powder lay, were above six score
Souldiars roasted, by means of the fire which the kindled matches of some of
the Harquebusiers put thereto. After the Town and Castle was consumed to
ashes, which greatly astonished the Bourguinions and other the borderers, which
already feared the siege of Auanes, whether the King had indeed caused his
army to march, had it not been for the sickness which day by day increased
among the Soldiers, of whom a good part were already secretly stolen away,
some charged with good booties, some with sickness, some with tedious and long
pains, and many with blows more then riches, hard to be endured in war,
although but soddaine and of small continuance, even of the most hazardous. An
occasion that in the end of July, the army was parted into Garrisons,
attending what the Emperor now would undertake: who much troubled with the
Protestant Princes army of Germany, saw him self then brought as it were into
two extremeties: either to accord almost whatsoever Maurice and his companions
would demand, as well for Religion, as the liberty of Germanye, and so to
enter into France, and revenge such injuries as he had received by King Henry,
or else to let him alone at his ease to gain the Country, whereby he might
another time enforce the Germans to submit themselves to the yoke of his
power: notwithstanding whether it were that an iniurye received from an equal,
seemed unto him more hard to be abidden, then the offense of an inferior; and
one especially bound with a kind of duty of subjection, or whether he
thought himself in better readiness against the French, or whether (as some
say) that his hatred conceived against King Henry, did more passionate him,
then against any other Prince; the Emperor resolved himself of a peace with
Germany, as it were to espouse a war with France, by such means as I will
deliver unto you.

The principal demands of Maurice.
Maurice stood principally upon two points, besides the deliuerye of the
Landgraue; the one, that Ferdinand with Maximilian his Son, and the
commissioners, might from thence take notice of such matters as were hurtefull
to the liberty of Germanye, and judge thereof according to the ancient custom
of Germanye: the other, that Religion should be let alone in peace, and no
harm in respect thereof to any man in the World, until the difference might
be decided. The Commissioners allowed of this form, but the Emperor showed
what he desired and judged fit, how it was reasonable that such as had ever
remained loyal toward him, and thereby greatly fallen into calamities; might
receive recompense for their losses. After long debating and some articles
eased, it was concluded that the Emperor should give his full answer by the
third of Iulye, and that in the mean time there should be a truce and
cessation of arms: The Commissioners then sent their letters to the Emperor
the 26. of June, to exhort him to a peace. Afterward the French Ambassador
being pressed to deliver the occasions of his Masters coffeehouse, and
under what conditions he would enter into a peace: having received news from
his Master, answered, that the King had not undertaken this war in respect of
his own particular, but to succor Germany so far going to decay: The French
Ambassadors answer to the Commissiones for peace.
as touching the conditions of peace, it was not the custom of the Kings of
France to demand it as became themselves in all respects: therefore he did
not think he had any cause to propose ought, without an assured hope of
obtaining the same: especially considering that the Emperor had most unjustly
made war against him, while he marched for their succors; notwithstanding he
would quit much for a peace, so as he might see it general, and refused not
but that they might take knowledge, and determine of these differents, to which
if Charles would not do reason, he protested the fault should only light of
his neck, for all the miseries which might ensue thereon.

In sum, that these Princes perceiving the delays of the Emperor, Peace
throughout Germany, and the occasions thereof.
had no sooner besieged Francforte, where was a great Garrison of the
Emperors, but by the advice of the most part of the Princes of Germanye, the
peace was concluded the last of Iulye 1552. See the occasions which drove the
one and the other to conclude the same. Among other reasons the great danger
was laid before Maurice, which he should stand in, as well on the Emperors
side which had already prepared a great army, as of his Cosins behalf Iean
Frederic, whom the Emperor meant to send home free into his Country. The
Emperor likewise stood in fear of the force of the Germans and of the
French. The Landgraues son for the long detention of his Father. Among other
articles the Captive Princes were to be set at liberty, no disquiet for their
Religion, which they would advise of at the first assembly; within six months
the King of France was to declare unto Maurice his demands: Albert was
comprehended therein if he laid down arms. The King misliked with the whole
course, yet he sent back the Hostages, and Maurice his: to wit, the Earl of
Nanteuil, and Iametz.

The History of France.
THE SECOND BOOK.
YOu have here before seen what preparatiues the Emperor, and the Catholic
Princes confederate for Religion, made of all parts, against the Protestant
Princes, to furnish the great army that they might be able, to the end they
might range them at devotion. The Germans notwithstanding had the party and
were so well succored, as at the last the Emperor accorded part of their
demands at Paussau, in the end of July, upon conditions over and above
before rehearsed, that Maurice should carry such people as he had to the
succor of Ferdinand King of Romans, against the Turks come down into
Transiluania. Afterward the Emperor extreamelye fretting at such losses as
King Henry had caused him to receive, fearing worse, The Emperor persuades
the Protestant princes and other, to succor him against the K. of France, for
the recouerye of Metz, Thoul, and Verdun.
and maruelously affected to a revenge, practiced by all means possible, to
persuade the Christian Princes, and above all the Germans, to succor him
against the King, whom he endeavored to render, a no less enemy to the
Empire, then to his own particular: he prevailed at last so far by the
dexterity of his own wit, that the rest of the Princes and imperial cities
as well of the association as other, were by little and little gained to
furnish him with men, money, and artillery; cheefelye in respect that he
protested that he would not imploye any part thereof to his own particular,
but only to the recovering of Metz; Thoul, and Verdun, three free Cities, and
holding of the Empire, which the King of France (said he with a discourse very
stout and full of great persuasions) had withdrawn from the Empire of the
Germans, under color of coming to aid them for the maintenance of their
Religion and liberty, which said he is not to be presumed for many reasons,
but principally for the diversity of the religion, whereof he has always
made profession, and by the effect which ensued thereon: having so much
dismembered the Germane Empire, which he had more annoied, had he been
permitted to have passed the Rhin, and entered into the Country full of
garboyles and factions of all parts, whereof he full well knew how to make his
profit; for his own part he promised, that he would employ therein all his
forces and means, to repair so great an injury: therefore he hastened the old
Spanish and Italian bands, which he caused to come out of Italye, both by Sea
and land; which being joined to the troops of Lombardy and Piemont, trauersed
the Alps, to repair to the rest of the army, which was assembled in Germany,
as well of Bohemians, Hungarians, Pollaques, Germans, Hannuyers, Wallons,
Cleuois, Flemings, Burgonions, as other, whereof he furnished the number of
fifty thousand Fantassins, and twenty thousand horse, with great provision
both of gross and small artillerye. Now for as much as Albert of Brandebourg
would not agree to the conditions of peace concluded at Paussau, The Emperors
army against the K. of France, for the recovery of Metz, Thoul, and Verdun.
and for not laying down his arms, he stood as banished the Empire, he
assembled a troop of men as malcontent as himself, who disuniting themselves
from the former confederacy, continued war against such towns as refused to
succor the league against the emperor, as Nuremberg, out of which he received
a great sum of money; afterward besieged Vlme, enforced the Bishops of
Bamberg, and Wissembourg, to very strange conditions; entered into Worms,
Spire, Mayence, Treuues, and sundry other places, whence he received great
treasure, so as making war apart, and yet as under the name and pretense of
the K. of France, whose arms they bare in their ancients, and cornets, he made
himself more renowned for his rigours, and extreme cruelties, the^ for any
other feats of war, notwithstanding being followed with 2000. horse, 8000.
pietons, and certain pieces which he trained to make him open passage, and
enforce any places of resistance, in the end he came as low as Treues, which he
ransackt; and as he passed forwards toward France, the King in whose name he
made the war, Albert of Brandebourg why not comprehended in the peace, and
banished the Empire, with the exploites of his malcontent army.
and caused such places as he took, to take their oath, sent unto him John da
Fresne B. of Bayonne, altogether freshly returned out of Germany, to understand
his intent, and agree with him touching his own pay, and such of his people
as would continue their course of living under the title and pretense of the
service of France, endemnifying the enemies as much as might be, and chiefly
upon the frontiers of Luxembourg. His first answer was very honest and
gracious, saying that as touching his own appointment, he was not come to the
K. service for a particular profit or hope to enrich himself thereby, but that
all his life long he had ever a desire to employe his person and means, to do
unto him all humble service, considering the good zeal of his Majesty, in
having so well maintained the franchisies and liberties of Germany, the very
occasion why he was separated from D. Maurice, esteeming the King so
reasonable, as that he would give an appointment equal to the merits of his
Soldiers, men of choice, and ready to dye for his service; with many other
gracious speeches. But the King and his council had a further reach into the
matter, The answer of Marquess Albert to the B. of Bayonne, and his behavior
against the K. and Emperor, and their reciprocallie toward him.
and as he mistrusted least the Emperor went about to practice him, certain
particulars happened, soon enough to make him apparently to judge how his
atonement was already in good terms, the conclusion whereof the Emperor had
notwithstanding ever delayed, hoping to prevent him, and under color thereof
so to shut him in, and enclose him so near with his army, which he had in the
field, that he would have him upon what condition himself best liked: the
which the Marquess had no less doubt of, setting before his own eyes such
entertainment as his kinsemen and allies had before received: an occasion that
he ever sought to gain the forewardes, resolved that if he were ever able to
join on the Frontiers of France, he should rest assured, and be well
appointed by the King, and that the Emperor would be most glad to agree to
whatsoever he would demand. Some councelled him to rest upon the Kings offers,
other to follow his fortune from higher of his own Country, upon these plats
and secret inductions, he notwithstanding passed further, mounting toward the
river of Mozelle, and coasting of Theonuille, he came to encampe at Roranges,
three leagues from Metz, where as soon as he was arrived, he sent to demand
victuals of the Duke of Guise (whom the King had already appointed Governor at
Metz, as well for the opinion of his valor, as the credit and reputation which
he had in all those Countries) for the entertaining of his army, The
behavior of Marquess Albert of Brandebourg toward the D. of Guise, governor
of Metz, and his toward the Marquess his army.
who to take from him all occasion of coffeehouse upon any refusal (albeit
it had been reasonable) did his best to help him with some for certain days;
which notwithstanding being otherwise considered of by him, he ceased not to
importunate him from day to day, to yield the same unto him in as great an
abundance, as if there had been no question but of taking all at his own
pleasure, without any regard to the future necessity, nor to the place where
this Prince was ordained, the time of his keeping thereof: being altogether
uncertain. In sum, that he so hardly pressed him and so often, that he was
constrained to declare unto him by Pierre Strossi, how the reason of the war
which he was not ignorant of, permitted not that one should disfurnish a place
of guarde, (chiefly of such importance of Metz) of victuals and provisions
whereof it should be furnished, to distribute them to a Camp, which might be
master of the field, and follow any other way or Country, as toward Sallines,
a most fertile Country, wherein he should not only find all commodities: but
in eating and consuming thereof, he should the more disadvantage the enemy, in
not being able to recover the like there. At which seeming to content himself,
he demanded some guide, which knew the Country, and might conduct him and lead
him thither: whereto was ordained by the Duke of Guise, and expressly sent
from Metz, one Gaspard de Hus, a native Gentleman of Metz: notwithstanding in
very short space he changed his mind, for instead of taking the way toward
Sallines, he came the more nearer within one legue to Metz, and encamped in a
place called Aey, where he made some stay, using all the scales which he could
imagine, for under color to gain the good grace of the Emperor by some
remarqueable service, entising the Duke of Guise to give him some trauerses, or
to trouble him by some disorder, had not the Prudence of that Prince been so
great as to foresee and remedy the same. Then having by diverse remoues
trauersed all that Country; and being turned toward Treues, to fetch there a
number of Soldiers which he had left there, he came down to Pont Camouson,
never having for all that resolved any thing with the B. of Bayonne, either of
his own appointment, or pay of his people: albeit that the King had again sent
back Lonsac unto him for the very same cause; notwithstanding he could conclude
upon nothing with him, training always the effect in diversity of demaundes,
colored with fair words, whereon it was a very uneasy matter to lay any
foundation, and therefore they entered into the greater suspicion of him, so as
the first mistrust began to increase more then before: wherefore with as much
speed as might be the King who having known the Emperors intents and
preparatiues, had already caused all his Garrisons, bands and arriere bands,
and other new companies, to repair unto Champagne, made his Camp to assemble
at S. Michel, a little town of Lorraine, upon the river of Meuse, The French
army assembled with all diligence at S. Michael, a little town of Lorraine.
six leagues on the side of Pont Camouson, as far from Verdun, and ten long
ones from Metz, whether likewise repaired the Constable, the D. of Neuers, the
Earl of Anguien, the Prince of Conde, the Earl of Aumale, the Vice-count of
Rohan, the Marshall S. Andre, Chastillon general of the French Fanterie, the
Earl of Villars, Bourdillon then ordained Marshall of the Camp, the Earl
Reingraue, and Reiroc, with their Regimentes of Lansquenets, and sundry other
great Lords and Captains.

The imperial army at Deuxponts scattered over the Country of Vaulges.
As touching the Imperial army, it was altogether ready, and grew great by
view of the eye, having so far already marched, as being arrived at
Deuxponts, it extended it self throughout all the Country of Vaulges, in
sort that it was very requisite to lodge, and cause to enter into Metz all
such succors, as well of men, of artillery, and other munition, as had been
determined to be sent thither, and therefore the most commodiously that he was
able, The Marquis Alberts army very dissolute about Pont Camouson.
the Constable sent from Saint Michael the companies of horse and foot which
were ordained to this purpose under the charge and conduct of Horace Farneze
Duke of Castres, carrying with him a number of pioners, and store of powder,
for the better strengthening of the town, though not in so great quantity, for
all that, as the Constable could have wished, and as he had done, without the
fear he had of the Marquess, who was always at Pont Camouson, his men being
over the plain Country round about, given to all insolences of war,
pilling, and leaving not ought but what they made no account of, or could not
carry or bear away. The which was found very strange, and greatly augmented
the distrust which might be had of him. Notwithstanding to bring him to some
reason, they sent unto him the Duke of Aumalle, de Chastillon, and the Earl of
Reingraue, The last answers or resolution of the marquis to the French, and the
behavior of his army.
to pray him to cause his people to leave of their wasting and spoiling of the
Country: and finally to resolve with him the last accord of his appointment
and pay of men. Then they soon enough discovered what had bin before
conceived of him but as it were in a cloud, rendering so ambiguous and haughty
an answer, with a spiteful and malecontent iesture, that he demanded almost
the moitie of a kings ransom for appointment. And as touching the order of his
men's living, he showed that he had already settled his affairs, answering in
the end with an assured resolution, that he was a friend to the king, and an
allie to the house of Lorrain, but he meant that his soldiers should have
wherewithal to live, and take it where they could find it, in case of
refusal, he was resolved what he had to do, and whether to retire himself:
yea, so far, as refusing to receive such money as the Constable had sent unto
him. Whereby they well perceived how he was reconciled to the Emperor, by the
practice of some. Who perceiving that he was out of his reach for doing him any
harm, and that he had himself great need of people, pardoned him all his
faults, and forbad that any should make his process in respect of the war
passed: ratified the contracts made with the B. of Bamberg and Wicibourg,
released him of going to the war in Hungary, yea, so far as to agree with him
the more, he pardoned the Earls of Itigen, both father and son, and Albert de
Mansfeld and his children. Now the Emperor lying sick of his gouts, and as
well for this cause, as for the importunity of the time, his army soiourning

footmen, and between seven and eight thousand horse: wherefore the French
began to hope better than ever, so as the advice of some was to charge upon the
Marquis whilst that the greater army of the enemy was so far of, the means
were the gallantnes of the French army, the coffeehouse of the Marquesses
people, not able besides to make any retrait into any place, wherein they
should not be pursued as enemies for their insolences passed, present, and to
come. Other prevailed in council, which persuaded that it would be better to
go more covertly to work, and underhand to withdraw the better part of his
captains and soldiers, by means of such Germans as were already come to the
kings service, with assurance of ready pay and good intertainment to come.
Which was so well handled, Colonel Reif-berg with a regiment of the marquis
Alberts, retireth himself to the kings seruic^
that with a great mutiny happened between themselves, the colonel Reif-berg
with his regiment, accepted from thence forward of the French party. Whereat the
marquis being extremely despited, and seeing otherwise how the army of France,
which every day was mightily increased, grew near neighbor unto him: how
alredie men murmured against him, and how his soldiers mutined among
themselves, whereof many both covertly and in sight were retired to the French,
and how through all these accidents he was in danger to be surprised and
enclosed, The Marquis demands pasport to return.
he certefied the Constable, how that since it pleased not the King to
entertain him into his service, not willing to accord unto him reasonable
appointment and pay, his request was to have a safe conduct to depart,
protesting that in other places of his enemies Country, he was able to do
unto him as good or better service as there, and could conquer lands, which
might perpetually remain unto him without sticking at a trifle: assuring him
notwithstanding upon his faith, never to take part with the Emperor against
him. The King being advertised hereof, and the matter thoroughly debated of
in Council, grew of opinion how it was much more expedient, to make a bridge
to a man's enemy, seeking to retire, than to put arms into the furnace to
heat him any more, as well to assure the people of the violent coming of the
man, seeking naught but his own adventure without respect of his life, as also
honestly to conuoie and conduct him, for in being willing to fight with him by
strong hand, albeit that fortune were favorable, yet could not the victory
remain but with great loss, peradventure of many brave men, whereof the King
as then stood in great need, a far greater enemy being at hand than the
other, The D. of Aumal appointed to accompany the Marquis.
as also to the end it might not be reproached unto him to have defeated one
which came to his succors, especially a Germane, one of the most ancient
friends and confederates of the French. To this end was the Bishop of
Bayonne left near about him for his better surety and conduct, to cause him
to have a safe and free passage thoroughout all the Kings Countries. Of the
other part the Duke of Aumalle was appointed to accompany him with two
hundred men at arms, and five hundred light horse, to hinder any of his men
from spoiling or ruining any of the kings subjects. For during the three
weeks that Albert made his abode near de Thoul upon Mozelle, they understood
of so strange disorder, and most excessive excesses, which his people did as
well to the Nobles, as pesants and church men, that in the end perceiving how
the Duke of Aumalle, to whom they addressed themselves, told them that he
was not able to have any other reason at his hands, albeit he had certefied
him thereof, they assembled themselves to kill and trusse up as many as they
were able. Whereof he greatly complained to the Duke, who answered him that
he would have regard to his duty, leaving him the passage free, but he
had gone against his word in permitting so great an insolency. Constrained in
the end to displace, he went and encamped near unto a poole upon a marish,
where in the night it rayned so hard, as he thought he should never have
found means to escape thence, especially his Artillery sticking fast in the
mire, and bemoyled even to the very axiltree and truckes of the carriages,
where the Duke of Aumalle had fair means to have clean ruyned him, without
the loss of any one man, had he been so disposed to have done.

Advice and counsel among the Emperors Captains, if they ought to besiege
Metz at that time of the year.
October was now well spent, when the imperial army as yet remained in the
Country of Vaulges, and toward Deuxponts, the Emperor still continuing very
ill disposed, as also for that he attended succors out of the Low Countries,
which were not as yet arrived, and his artillery and munition which he caused
to be brought down the Rhine as far as Confluence, from thence the easier
all along the river of Moselle, to make it be landed almost hard by Metz. And
for that the sharpest coldes of the winter begin in this season, such a
delaie caused a number of persons to be of opinion, that the Emperor would
not so late undertake a siege of so great consequence, and that he would not
expose so fair and well complete an army, to think to vanquish both the
rigor of the time, and a Town so well provided, as all the Captains imagined:
who councelled him rather to assaie the recovery of the rest of the towns, as
well of the Duchy of Lorraine, as of Barois and Luxenbourg, in which he might
well cause his army to winter, and keep it covered from the evil season, in
which mean time they of Metz should be constrained to spend their victuals,
and consume their munitions, being continually notwithstanding held in
subjection by such roads as the soldiers should daily make upon them, and the
Country about more and more to affeeble them, and clean take away all means
from them to recover victualles; whereof toward the spring they would stand
in so great necessity, as they might then easily set upon them to their
greater advantage. Showing further, how that before he cold well dispose and
appoint the siege of this so great a town, and that his artillery could be
planted and prepared for the battery, winter would so hardly be come on, that
it would be a cause of interrupting all his means, as well by reason of
snowes, winds, raines, and extreme frosts, causing a great number of his
soldiers to die, as through the difficulty which they should have to recover
victuals, being detayned and stayed back by the constraint and indisposition
of the time, as also in having them oftentimes be met with, and taken away by
the French. Besides all that, together with the loss that might fortune him to
receive there, such and so great a shame, as he would rather wish it had cost
him the crown of his Empire, so as he had not been at all there. For after
having combatted, and been in part defeated by the fury and violence of the
time, he should find besides another enemy strong and puissant, which
attended but only an occasion to ruin him for ever. This advice though it
were the most certain for the Emperors security, yet could it not by any
means be received of him, for his spirit being pricked forward and
solicited by an extreme desire of being revenged, forgot all accidents and
perils, to be happily resolved in the end of one only point, whereby he
might know but how to be revenged of the King. And among others it seemed
best unto him, first to address himself to the town of Metz, within which
he well knew were many of the principal Princes and great Lords of France:
and that besides, it was perfectly furnished and provided with great store of
munition. Wherefore it seemed unto him, that if by the surplus of the rest of
that year, he could work so well, as to be able only to recover it, he might
easily by means of such prisoners as he should find therein, obtain and get
again at the kings hands whatsoever he had taken from him, persuading himself
that he would help himself with the French men's own rods and preparatiues to
constrain them thereto, and that being come once to the top, and having subdued
this first and principal fortres, wherein was the very flower of the French
soldiers, he easily promised to himself the compassing of his lesser
enterprises. So as in the end the Emperor marched with his army toward the
river of Moielle, never following for all that the right way, as if he had
meant to descend toward Theonuille, and the Duchy of Luxembourg. Whereof the
Duke of Guise being advertised, not willing to loose or leave in pray one of
the old Ensigns of Captain La Prade, which was within Roc de Mars, took so
good order; as in the sight of his enemies, the rather by the means of a
skirmish which the Duke of Nemours, and the Earl of La Roche-foucaut made
before Theonuille, the Ensign having set all the Castle on fire, was retired
and saved, together with the better part of the Artillery which was therein.

The Constable in the mean time who still remained at S. Michel to see and
know what course the Emperor meant to take, having intelligence how the
imperial army marched, holding on that way, doubting the event of sundry
things, among other, least leaving of Metz, it might address it self to
Verdun, which was not strong enough, nor almost of any reasonable defense, or
to some feeble town or unprovided, caused the French army in like sort to
march, and approached nere unto Verdun, in which as then the Marshall S. Andre
remained Lieutenant for the King, with his company of one hundred men at arms,
and Tauannes which was governor with his company of fifty men at arms, and
eight Ensigns of French Fanterie, of the legion of Champagne, two companies of
light horse, and as many Harquebusiers on horseback, who without ceasing either
day or night, caused them to travail about the fortification, replenishing
otherwise this great Town, with corn, wines, and all other sorts of
victuals, which they could find round about. As much did Rabaudanges Governor
of D'Anuille, and De Blaneau then Governor of Yuoy, and the Captain Baron
Governor of Mommedy, striving as it were with a kind of envy, and forcing
themselves who should best better his place; for albeit that they were already
strong and well appointed, yet did they continually watch to advance thereto
whatsoever they might presume to be wanting therein. Now there rested no more
but the town of Satenay, by corrupt speech called Astenay: which the Imperials
being already in the field, men doubted might be first assaulted and taken on
the sudden, unprovided of every thing, as indeed it was: albeit that before
time the late King Francis had caused it to be repaired and fortified, to serve
him for some shadow or color, against the^ of the duchy of Luxembourg: since
notwithstanding the evil situation thereof having been declared unto him, and
how much more hurtefull it would grow unto him, if after having fortified it,
it should happen to fall into the enemies hand, he caused the fortes and
bulwarks in many places to be cast down and raced, and the flankers and
defenses to be ruined; putting it again in this sort to the domanie of the
Duke of Lorraine, sometime after notwithstanding the King having again
recovered it, and thrust out the Bourgonians which had seized thereof, and began
to repair it as you have seen, to aid themselves against him, ever since
held it in his own hands, without adding for all that any new fortification,
but only to hinder that it should not be hurtful unto himself. Hereupon
afterward having been showed unto him by the D. of Neuers, how it might be
made strong and defensable, and that himself without any danger would
undertake to keep it, he commanded that all means and devises should be sought
out to fortify it with all diligence: to which this Prince voluntarily rendered
himself so subject, that any great labor seemed to him but a pleasure, for
the perfecting of his work, which he had in so great reco^mendation, that much
and the principal part thereof was found well forward before ever it was imagined
that the fou^dations were as yet laid; and not only that, but having
intelligence how in a little town named Vireton within 5. leagues of Satenay,
there were a number of thieves and bannished persons assembled, living upon
nothing but theft and spoils, which they made about the country, forseeing
further that if the siege should fortune to come before Satenay, that this
receptackle of brigands would serve very fitly to his enemies, Vireton
surprised and besieged through the secret and great diligence of the D. of
Neuers.
to retire thither their victual, munitions and other necessaries, he
surprised them so fortunately, as in a morning before that ever they could have
thought him awake, having no means to save themselves, or to have reskew from
their partners, they saw themselves enclosed and enwrapped by this Prince,
accompanied with ten Ensigns of French Fanterie: to wit, two of Verdun, two of
D'anuille, 2. of Yuoy, two of Mommedy, and two of Satenay; of Caualerie of the
companies of the Duke of Bouillon, of Iametz, and of La Roche du Maine, of
light horse and Harquebusiers on horseback, of Captain Sapoigne, and sundry
Gentlemen of his own house, so as being arrived before this town in this
sort, to the end readilye to execute his determination, he caused it to be
battered as soddenly as might be, without giving any leisure at all to make any
trench, or dress any baskets of earth, but the artillery being only covered
with Carts, Tables, doors, Wagons, and such gear, as at that instant they
were able to find to put before it, he so planted it and cunningly trauersed
it to the mark, that the wall was greatly shaken;, and a very reasonable
breach made; the which they within endured without any semblance at all of
fear, or willingness to yield themselves. The French Soldiers seeing the
gappe, had so burning a desire to go to the assault, as being impatient of
temporising, and without tarrying for the Generals commandment La Chesne
Ensign to Captain La Land, followed with some number of Soldiers, ran
hastelye into the ditche with his head forwards, to thrust right into the
breach, who notwithstanding was valiantlye put back by the Bourgonions, and
sore hurt, whereof afterward he died. Arbelay likewise the Ensign of
Captain Baron was there slain, and many valiant Soldiers. In the end they
within besieged, seeing the rest of the preparations, and not finding
themselves provided, nor strong enough to sustain a general assault, made a
sign of being desirous to parley, requiring that some respit might be given
unto the^ within, who if they had not readily succors, promised to yield
themselves, their lives and goods saved. The Duke of Neuers would by no means
accord unto them one only hour of delay, but answered that if they did not
yield themselves at the instant unto his discretion, their lives saved,
Vireton rendered up to the discretion and mercy of the D. of Neuers.
he would cause them al to pass by the edge of the sword; so as having a while
considered of the danger, they yielded themselves to the mercy and discretion
of the Duke, which happened in very good time, for there remained no more but
two bullets of a Culuerin left: they being gone out, to the end no leisure
should be given to the French soldiers to amuse about the spoil, fire was put
in diverse places of the Town: as for the Prisonners the Duke of Neuers had
already given them leave to depart, when as they were as well known unto the
Captain Sapoigne their neighbor, Son to Gilles de Leuant sometimes
governor of Luxembourg, against whom Sapoigne declared unto the Duke, that the
honestest man among them all had one hundred times deserved death, and how he
should show them too much favor to save their lives, for if he should set the^
at liberty, it would be a means to make them do more harm to the French:
Therefore the greatest part of them were retained and carried prisonners to
Satenaye, afterward some were sent back, the principal being reserved,
cheefely the Captain Dalumont otherwise Malladerie, and his ensign named
Arbonniere: all these matters being thus happily achieved in one only day,
the army returned the same very night to lodge at Satenay with all the
companies, except those of Mommedy, who in respect they were near hand retired
as then from the place, commandment being given, that they should daily
repair thither by hundreds, to make even with the ground the rest of Vireton,
which the fire was not able to waste or consume, and on the next morrow having
dispatched S. Simon to carry news unto the K. who continually remained at
Reims, and commanded Despotz Governor of Satenay, to receive of the
inhabitants within the town, the oath of fidelity in the K. name, he dparted
toward the constable, who caused the army to temporise, attending what the
Emperor would attempt; who finding all his forces assembled, and the succors
which he attended out of the low Countries being arrived, took the high way
again toward Metz, and was approached as far as Sarabuc, The Imperial army
approaches within 7. or 8 leagues of Metz.
seven leagues from thence: and a few days after the D. of Alua, Lieutenant
general of the Emperor, and the Marquess of Marignan Colonel of the Italian
Fantassins, with fourteen thousand foot, four thousand horse, and six
field pieces, approached so near as to discover the Town, and the fittest
places for to pitch their Camp in, which was not done without a furious and
brave skirmish of the French souldiars, The D. of Alua and Marquess of
Marignan came to descry Metz.
who being sallied forth, for a beginning made them well to perceive and feel
with what affection they were determined to defend themselves, and maintain
the place, wherein the French as then atchiued great reputation as well of the
Duke of Guise as of their enemies: who afterward retired themselves to S.
Barbe, two leagues back, with small advantage, and loss of near hand eight
or nine score men, and of French men there was lost Marigny Picard, issued out
of the ancient and most renowned house of Salezart, and five Soldiers which
were slain on the place, Sylly Mompha and the Captain La Vaure, dyed there of
their wounds.

The D. of Aumales aduertiseme^t to the K. upon the determination of the
Marquess of Brandebourg.
In the mean time the D, of Aumalle standing well assured of all the plattes
and sollicitings which they practiced with the Marquess Albert, advertised the
K. thereof who was at Reims, to the end to provide of all sides, as well on that
part as toward Picardie, certifying him that the most expedient way was rather
to set upon him, the^ to suffer him to join with the enemy, and so to make him
the stronger, and to bring that to pass, he let him to understand that with
such means as he already had two hundred men at arms, would be sufficient to
defeat him. The King made answer that he liked his device very well,
provided that it were wisely executed, and without too much hazard, and
presently he commanded Bourdillon to go and join with him with a hundred
men at arms, and obey him wherein soever for his service he would imploye
him: whereupon he came toward him within three leagues, near unto which
place, he readily advertised him how by the Kings commandment, with all
possible diligence he had made his repair toward him, to obey him, beseeching
him to signify his pleasure, and what he was to do. The D. of Aumalle
answered him that he was maruelously contented at his so great diligence used,
and that the Marquess having already passed over the river of Muze, was ready
likewise to go over the other of Madon, to retire himself to the Emperors
Camp, and he knew not any great means how to follow him any longer: wherefore
in brief he determined to retire himself to Thoul, to make war against the
enemy. This answer was the cause that Bourdillon stirred not from Blanieau
attending his return. Three days after notwithstanding the D. of Aumalle sent
his Trumpetter with letters to the Marquess, to suck always some intelligence
from him: but so it was as finding him at the borough of S. Nicolas, whether he
was gone with a small company to conclude with the Emperors Deputies, making
small account of those letters; the Trumpetter was stayed, to the end that
readily returning he might not discover the secret, nor make report of what
he had seen: who maruelling greatly at this strange entertainment, went to
the Marquesses truchman for it was told him that he had been brought up in
France, The D. de Aumales trumpeter stayed by the Marquess Albert.
thinking by that means that he would have carried some good affection to
have pleasured those of that Nation, whence he had received all kind of
courtesy, but contrariwise he found him a brave and presumptuous Gallant, who
judged himself of the highest valor, by reason of the familiarity which he
had with his Master. The Trumpetter be sought him to procure his dispatch and
return. He contrariwise without making any answer at al to his request,
railed extremely at the French, and wishing unto them a thousand curses, he
protested with great oaths, that before it were long he would bathe himself in
their blood. So the Trumpetter was enforced to tarry until the Thursday
before the day wherein the defeat should be accomplished, as they told him
and how that the morrow after he should return with his answer: which came
not to pass for all that: for that day all things being changed to the worse,
the Trumpeter was more rigorously entreated then before, led, bound fast, wrong
hard, and trained, as if how-erlye he expected naught else then to be hanged
or dye miserably. Thus the Marquess had determined the next morrow to take
his way to the Emperors Camp, and there rested nothing but to unite and
appease some of his Captains and Soldiers, who had no great mind to turn
their face to take oath to the Emperor, in respect of the evil entertainment
which they had found both at his hands and the Spaniards, in the wars passed.
The 28. of October the D.D'aumalle being informed of this departure, dislodged
at the break of day, with all his Caualerie from the Port of S. Vincent, where
he lay, and put himself in battle upon the top of an high mountain called
La Croiz du Montier, above the Marquess, to consider well and view what he
would do, and what course he would take; who in like sort ordered his
battles to follow his intended way, without having any opinion at that day
to fight with the French: yet these two armies were not long time neighbors,
but that the skirmishes began hottely, as well by the Country people as some

people to fight.
who were run thither hoping to rob and spoil some booty at the tail of
the Marquess. To whom report thereof was made two or three times before he
would believe ought, answering that the D.D'aumalle did not make search after
him. It was about the beginning of November that these plaintes redoubling of
all parts, himself with his truchman, would needs go see how true indeed it
was, where he was very fiercely repulsed, so as with a Harquebuse shot his
truchman was slain hard by him, which moved him in such sort, as returning to
his people, and with liuelye and affectionate prayers and exclamations, having
declared unto them, The D. de Aumelle and the French charged upon fiercely.
how the D.D'aumalle with a great number of French Caualerie, attended them in
the passage to hew them in pieces, and that the least that could befall them
was death, which they could by no means escape without doing some notable and
great exploite, he used all pains and means to encourage them to the
Combat, laying down before them in like sort, that if they had any doubt of
the rigor and punishment of the Emperor, they were much less to hope or
look for any better entertainment of the French. All these persuasions could
no whit for all that move the Fanterie of Albert, who mutining for want of pay,
refused so go any further; but well the Caualerie, especially the chieftanes,
and above all; George of the noble familye of Lichtebergh, who was as in the
Protestants war his Lieutenant general: the which fiercely went to charge upon
the companies of the D.D'aumalle, who was upon the point and determination to
retire, albeit that the B. of Bayonne egged him forward to the defeat of the
Marquess: but it was so late that they were already at hand to join together,
and to fight with so extreme evil luck, as at the first reencounter they
met with a troop of servants, who had been set in that place but to make a
show; The D. companies put to flight by the Marquess.
whom they incontinently put to flight: and by and by charged upon an other
squadron of light horse, and Harquebusiers on horseback, the which in like
sort they disordered, finding an onnerture without fight to charge upon the
very ranks of the men of war, which they set upon and caused to recoyle with
Pistol shot, as troops and companies evil provided of Lances to defend
themselves. The D. of Aumalle seeing his cauallerie thus broken, and fled on
all hands, greatly agreeued, and foreseeing an unhappy end to ensue this
enterprise, willed Breze the Lieutenant of his company to retire, and the best
way that he might be able to save his company. Afterward notwithstanding
seeing the great fire kindled near unto him, and the enemies much intermingled
with the principal troop of his men of war, and nearest to his person, where
the co^bate was most sharp, and the enemies courageously reskued, by the small
number which was there of gentlemen, he joined him together with those few that
he had left, crying unto them with a smiling and assured countenance; my
ompanions, my friends, Battle; Battle, afterward abandoning himself to
fortune, which he had ever notwithstanding so ill cheered, and entertained
until then, without respect of his life, with the Sword in his fist he thrust
into the press, and did as many great acts as was possible for him to do;
but the throng of his enemies continually waxed greater, and the number of his
own diminished, as well by being abandoned by those which fled, as by the
death of the brauest men slain and beaten down before him, other sore
wounded, and unhorsed, taken, and led away prisoners: in such sort as himself

Vicecount of Rohan was there slain, for as 2. Germans which held him

have him, arrived a third, Death of Vicecount Rohan.
who after many disputes shot him into the brain with a Pistol, whereof he
presently dyed. He was greatly lamented of all men, as one who greatly
contraried, and withstoode stiffely this enterprise: the company of D. D'
aumalle was almost all there defeated, and among other of renown were slain
De Nancay guidon of the said company; De la Motie Dusseau guidon of the Vidame
of Charstres company, the guidon of the Earl of Sancerres company, S. Forgeus
Captain of the light horse, the Baron of Couches, De Ioncy the youngest of the
house of Rochebaron in Charollois, the young Vaux, and sundry other Gentlemen to
the number of two hundred, of Prisonners remained many, together with the D.
D'aumalle, among other Desguilly master of the Camp of light horse, the Baron
of Guerres, and Do lieutenant of the Vidasme of Charstres company, who for not
being known, and by the help of their friends, escaped for a small ransom.
As for Bourdillon the same night some speeches having been reported unto him,
which the paisans coming from thence used touching the defeat, presently
caused a Gentleman of his company to mount on horseback, accompanied with some
other to go learn the matter better, and bring him the certainty thereof:
afterward within a short space following two Gentlemen of quality, which were
hardly escaped thence, rehearsed unto him how all the matter passed. Upon this
occasion, without making any greater loss, or causing more travail to his
men, he dispatched that night Castellus lieutenant of his company, to carry the
sorrowful news to the King: and presently sent his Trumpeter, to the Earl of
Vaudemont, to pray him to permit the bodies of Rohan and the Baron of Couches,
to be buried within the Church at Nancy, as they were afterward, and others in
like sort.

The Marquess Albert having now his heart puffed up, and received far into
the Emperors good grace, took again his way on toward Nancy; where he
had much speech with the Earl Vaudemont, touching this defeat, for amidst his
discourses and pleasant tales, he laughed at the great hardines of the D.
D'aumalle. Afterward he returned to encamp at Pont Camouson on the other side
of the river, whether anon the Emperor sent unto him a number of horse to
strengthen and aid him, until he might be joined to his camp, which was
already assembled, and encamped about Metz. A little above the Pont aux Moras
within the vynes, near unto an Abbey dedicated to S. Martin, was the quarter
where the 13. of November the Marquess Albert went to entrench himself, from
whence having caused the D. of Aumalle to be dressed, The Castle of Clermont in
Argonne surprised by Chastillon.
he sent him prisonner into Germanye to be kept in good surety. The Kings army
was arrived at Clermont in Argonne, a little village well situate in the
country of Barrois, above which on the top of a mountain, is a Castle
naturally strong in respect of the height, inaccessable in two or 3. places;
the which being very commodious and convenient for many necessities, Chastillon
partelye by craft, and partly through fear which the captain of the place
had, seeing the French army to arrive, surprised and rendered it to the
disposition of the Constable his Uncle, for the K. afterward men wrought a
long time to fortify and amend it better, and an other little town named
Varenne; and in the villages round about all covertly was the K, army lodged;
the Constable, (the D. of Neuers remaining Lieutenant general in the army)
departed thence, to go see the K. at Reims, very sorye and grieved at this
evil adventure.

As these were eagerly in arms there in Lorraine, Du Reux with the imperial
army would feign surprise La Fere in Picardie.
so the rest would not be at rest in Pickardie, for Du Reux the Emperors
Lieutenant general in the low Countries, with a number of Flemings; Hannuyers,
and Wallons, amounting to forty Ensigns of foot, and above two or three
thousand horse, having entered into the field with resolution to enforce and
surprise La fere in Picardie, which appertains to the D. of Vendosme, and
after finding that hardly he could compass it with his honor, the Admiral
D'Anebaut being there within, well provided of whatsoever was necessary for
him; after having burned the town of Noyon, Nelle, Chaunis, Roye, and a
magnificent house which the late King Francis caused to be builded for the
pleasure of hunting, called Foulembray, with between seven and eight hundred
villages, whereof the most part were of the D. of Vendosme his patrimony, and
to speak truly done infinite mischiefs always, by the means of the Queen of
Hungary, went to besiege Hedin: the town was quickly taken, Hedin besieged by
Du Reux.
not being strong enough to sustain the battery nor the assault: shortly
after the Castle was besieged on the Park side, where a great tower which
defended the towers on that side, being much broken and the defenses beaten
down and shattered to pieces, they found means to undermine and dig down a
great piece of the wall, and with Cannon shot to break down the squares and
spurs as well of that great tower, as of the wall: wherefore the whole suncke
down and was turned topsie turuie within the ditche, which filled it up, and
made a bridge very easy to go to the assault, the rampire remaining merely
uncovered and worn, they had no baskets nor platformes to cover it, and albeit
the rampire was as yet seven or eight foot high, they within notwithstanding
seeing the wall so suddenly fallen down and the ditch filled, were so amassed and
astonished, as without tarrying any assault, they yielded themselves to
composition, Hedin yielded to the Emperor by de Rasse.
their lives and goods saved, and the composition was made by de Rasse and
Ianlis, to which D'ouoye of the house of Querqui would never consent. At this
loss the K. much marvelled, considering that a little before De Rasse had
certified him that he had no doubt at all of the holding out of that castle,
but that which was found most strange, and that gave to the French occasion
diversely to speak, was that De Rasse had ever a good reputation of a valiant
Knight: Admiral de Anebaut dies at La Fere.
hereupon the King understanding of the death of the Admiral D' Anebaut,
deceased at La Fere in Picardie, whether he was retired to defend it from the
Imperials, departed from Reims to approach as far as Challons, whether the D.
of Neuers, the Marshall S. Andre, de Chastillon, and the principal chieftanes
of his army came unto him, to the end to advise and conclude as soon as might
be, of some way how to recover Hedin: The D. of Grise assured within Metz.
therefore the D. of Guise was sent unto, to know of him how long time he could
be able to defend Metz, and if he were in any necessity, he should be the
sooner succored, who assuring himself of the will of God, and of the faith
and loyalty of many valiant men which had followed and watched about his
person, certified the King that there was no doubt at al of his town, nor of
those which were within, in all whom he knew alike and semblable affection for
his service, choosing rather to leave their lives then to go out of that place
with dishonor. Besides that he had want of nothing whatsoever, whereby he
should not be able to keep it against all power of man, with the aid of him,
without whom he watches in vain, which will undertake the keeping of any
places: he advertised him in like sort, The distribution of the Imperial
army about Metz.
how that the second day of November the D. of Alua with the greatest part of
the Imperial army, having quitted the lodging at Belle Croix ( Brabanson
being left there with three Regiments of high Germans, two of low, and three
thousand horse) and passed the River of Seille, was come to encampeneere unto
the Town, distributing his army in the places about, as at S. Clement, and at
S. Arnoul, where he was lodged with the spanish companies: One part of the
Germans was lodged at Pont de Magny, Dom Louis d'Auilla with the Spanish
cauallerie at La Maladiere, the Seneshal of La Morauie with the Bohemian horse
at Blery, the overplus at Ollerye, S. Priech, at the grange aux Dames, at the
grange aux Mercieres, and other places about: certifying him further how that
they had begun their trenches near unto the Port S. Thibaut, as if they
purposed there to plant their principal battery. In the end he wrote the
names and surnames of such as had best performed their duty in sallies out
and skirmishes; not forgetting many other affairs as the time served, in his
answer. The D, of Ne-Lieutenant general over all the K. forces in Loraine.
The King thus standing assured on that part, ordained the D. of Neuers his
Lieutenant general over all his forces, which remained in Lorraine: and for
the good and agreeable services which Gasper de Coligny, called Chastillon, had
done him and daily did, he honored him with the office of Admiral of France,
and at the very instant constituted him his Lieutenant, to bring back his army
into Picardye, there to resolve upon and execute, whatsoever should be most
profitable and necessary for his service. Chastillon being made Admiral of
France brings all the K. army from out of Picardy toward Hedin.
Afterward all the chiefetanes being advertised and instructed in their
charges, the army was levied by the Admiral, to cause it to take the right
way toward Hedin: the Marshall S. Andre was retired to Verdun, the D. of
Neuers with his company, and that of La Roche du Maine, retired to S. Michel,
to the end to cut of al victuals fom the enemy and turn them away parting
themselves in sundry companies within the Vallyes: within S. Michel there were
already the Ensigns of Captain La Prade and of La Mothe Gondrin on hundred
lighthorse of captain Pelous, and one hundred Harquebusiers of Captain
Lauenture and Bourdillon with his company, who a little before was returned
from that place, whether the D. Aumalle had written unto him. The D. of Neuers
his companies make roads to cut off victualles from the enemies.


As soon as the D. of Neuers was arrived at S. Michel, there was a road made
by his company, with certain light horse and Harquebusiers on horseback,
under the charge of Mouy, guidon of his company, a valiant and resolute
gentleman, as far as Malatour, a little town strong enough near unto
Gorges, and in other great villages, which covered a valley strong enough, full
of hollow woods and dangerous places, which they of the Country called La
Veur, into which certain soldiers were retired, as well Spanish as Germans,
of the imperial auantgard. Some were slain, and the rest carried away
prisoners. This misfortune fell upon those as returned from the castle of
Aspremont, thinking to have taken the Earl there in his bed, to whom it
happened so well, as at that instant he was at Saint Michael near unto the
Duke of Neuers. For in stead of thinking to take, they were taken, and carried
away with some booty. Such roads there and abouts were continued by the Duke
of Neuers for the space of three weeks, himself being there sometimes in
person, which so sore annoied and troubled his enemies, as they were enforced
to forget the way of that quarter. Yea, by reason of these continual alarums,
the imperial army was oftentimes constrained to remain half a day in
battle, with great travel, coldes, and other necessities. But if they endured
much, the French men were not clean exempted, because that oftenest times they
were feign to mount on horseback at midnight, enduring so sharp frosts and
cold, as some of them have ever since had diverse of their members benumbed,
and other dead, lost by the pain and insupportable torments which they
endured, having continually the snow up to their horse bellies: and in such
equipage passed they the day and night without food, after in the day time,
and when they thought to repose themselves, and take a little breath in their
lodging, they were feign to keep the watch for fear of surprisall: so as, as
well to keep themselves, as to annoie and plague the imperials, they endured
their part of the discommoditie of the time, but much less as they well
witnessed, which had abandoned the^: the Italians above all, who daily went
threedmeale from the Emperors camp, to beseech the Duke of Neuers to receive
them into the Kings service, who moved with pity, The Italians of the
Emperors camp repaired to the Duke of Neuers to be entertained in the kings
service.
seeing some dead, and half passing, other hunger starued without money, used
all liberality possible toward them, and caused money to be given them out
of his own coffers attending the kings pay. Afterward he sent them to
Captain Andre de May More, a man of approved hardiness, to dress of them
companies as well of foot as light cauallerie. By them and other spials the
French were advertised of the most great diligence and wonderful preparatiues
which the Duke of Alua had made to address his battery, the great plains,
the trenches, so ample, large, and deep, as has bin seen of long time, the
great number of artillery and munitions, the almost innumerable quantity of
baskets, which he caused continually without any rest to be made and filled,
making no account of the life of those miserable vascadors, no more than of
brute beasts exposed to the mercy of the artillery and counterbatterie of
the town. They reported likewise the great harms and annoiances that they
within did incessantly unto them, their resolute sallies, so furious and in
such sort, as some thought them rather ghosts and deuillish spirits than
mortal creatures. And others reporting how the conduct of the most part of
their sallies was happily executed, attributed all to a rashness and bold
hardiness, more than to wisdom or any discreet foresight of the
inconveniences like to happen, in such sort; as one Sergeant of a band,
accompanied with five or six soldiers only, with his halbard chased away,
and constrained to abandon the trenches more than three hundred men. Some other
in like sort durst go and nail their artillery, and kill their canoniers
upon their pieces. The which the enemies notwithstanding would not repute as a
fact worthy either of them, nor of a valyant and magnanimious heart. Besides
that, twice or thrice a day the cauallerie issued forth, putting the imperials
often enough in such disorder, as some of the most hardiest Gentlemen, which
would do any act worthy of memory, or for the remembrance or love of their
mistresses, would go break their lances, and strike with their swoords even
within the enemies tents, so far as to cut their ropes asunder, executing
strange things, and not heard of in our memory. Now if the French by such
feats were desirous to show themselves loyal subjects to their king, and
curious of honor, the Duke of Alua reposed not less of his part, who showed
himself so desirous and inflamed to render into the obedience of his master
the Emperor, that puisant City, to rejoice him with the taking of so many
princes, great Lords, and valyant men as were there within, that not sparing
any labor, nor the lives of his, he planted his battery ready the twentieth
of November, beginning to shoot at the defenses, to wit, at that of the
portall of the port Champenois, and of a bulwark which is within a great
tower, the which is toward the river called La Tour D'Enfen, and surnamed La
Tour de Lanques, and at a little Church being within the town, where there was
a platform, in sum, they razed and ruined as much as they could, whatsoever
might serve as they judged to the defense of the town. The six and twentieth he
began to cannon it with such an impetuositie, as in the memory of any living
man was never heard the like, having in front forty great pieces, which
carrying bullets of an extraordinary weight, shot day and night without any
intermission, other than to refresh themselves. In the mean time the besieged
slept not, but with the princes and great Lords, and generally even to the
very least, they carried earth and panniers to rampire, in such diligence and
carfulness, as at any place where they imagined the breach should be made, in
less than twice four and twenty hours they made up the rampire the height
of a perapect, leaving between the old wall and the rampire convenient
flankers, and a trench farced with diverse drogs, to feast the most hotly
disposed, if they meant to go to the assalt. Attending which; I will look
back again into the exploits of the French army.

As soon as de Reux with the Flanders army, which as yet remained about
Hedin, perceived the French to approach, without any countenance at all made
to be willing to fight for maintenance of them which were ready to be besieged
within, he retired, leaving his son in the castle, to whom he vowed and
swore great punishment if he yielded the place with dishonor and reproach.
With the same charge he left with him his companion, a Henault Gentleman named
Harenuille. So the breach being made far stronger by them than before, and
standing provided and strengthened with whatsoever they could imagine to be
necessary for them, they sowed a brute that both the one and the other would
rather die there within, than yield themselves so good cheap as they that
first went out thence. Shortly after the French army being arrived, the Duke
of Vendosme, Lieutenant for the King in Picardie, caused his approaches to be
made, and one of his batteryes to be planted in the very same place where the
Bourgonians had addressed theirs, and the other upon the slope of a little
hill of the side of Therouanne. So Hedin began to be cannoned the seventeenth
of December most furiously, and there were discharged four thousand three
score, The castle of Hedin yielded up by de Reux his son to the D. of Vendosme
for the king.
and six shot of Cannon, without making any breach or ouerture, that had not
yet a rampire behind eighteen or twenty foot high. Yet faintness of heart
and fear of death ceazed the besieged, who yielded themselves by composition,
their lives and goods saved, their Ensigns displayed, with two mean pieces of
artillery at their tail, without taking away ought, or transporting of any
thing else of that which they had found within: so the castle of Hedin was
yielded and rendered unto the Kings obedience, by the conduct of the Duke of
Vendosme, the eighteenth of December. And albeit that the chief was acquitted
of his duty in keeping it, yet fearing his fathers cholar, he remained a long
time not daring to present himself before him. Suddenly after the Duke of
Vendosme being advertised that the enemies meant to pass over the river, to
give him battle at the hour that he parled with them of Hedin, by the Kings
advise he purposed to ease them of that pain, and him self went to seek
them out with his forces, with intention to fight with them if they would
abide. But not finding themselves strong enough, they retired toward the
strong towns, and further into the heart of the Country, quitting unto him
the passages to execute his good pleasure, and a means to revenge himself of
those cruelties which they had committed upon his lands.

At such time as these affairs thus passed there, the Duke of Neuers having
caused on the side of Saint Michael many and sundry roads to be made, to the
great damage of the enemies of the crown of France, departed thence by an
intelligence which he had, how that on the side of Espinaux, by the County of
Vaudemont, The D. of Neuers at Vauco^leu^s, to stop such victuals as came from
the French county to the Emperors camp, and his courses to anoy the imperials.
ordinarilye came down great quantity of victuals and provisions to the
Emperors camp. Therefore with those few men of war which he was able to
recover, being two hundred men at arms, two hundred light horse, and as many
harguebuziers on horseback, he retired toward Vaucouleurs, a little French
village, renouned enough upon the river of Meuse, within five leagues of Thoul,
included within many of the lands of Lorain, from whence within two days after
he departed to go toward Thoul, thither causing his forces to approach, which
he made to be lodged in a very fair and great village named Blanieau, a
temporal lordship and roialtie of the Chapitre of S. Stephens of Thoul, and in
other little ones adjoining. Shortly after their coming was a role made of the
men at arms, and archers, the most likely and best mounted, to the number of
six score, conducted by Mouy, to break and cut up the head of a marvelous
great pond in the county of Vaudemont, thereby to drown and destroy a number
of villages which were underneath it, whether many victuals had retired
themselves, and where the enemies forages found yet great store of corn and
forage: which notwithstanding was already found broken and cut up, to the
great hinderaunce of the County. The French men having made the hole greater,
and returning homewards, met with a great troup of wagons and chariots, laden
with all sorts of victualers and munitions, addressed to the imperial camp.
Whereof having made the greatest spoil that they were able, with a great deal
of wines of Arbois, and marred the overplus, and having slain some of the
guides and waggoners, led away as many horses as they were able, and retired
with great danger, notwithstanding that they were constrained to pass at full
day through sundry villages where some of the enemies were lodged, as well of
foot as horse. The which notwithstanding fell out without the loss of any
one, in respect they were not known, apparelled like merchants, without any
white crosses or scarfes seen, and their harness covered with their cloakes,
being likewise thought to be auantcouriers, to draw them to an ambuscade, or
fearing least the greater troops of the enemies were covered and lay hid.
Wherefore the D. of Neuers very much contented herewith, anon after retired to
Vaucouleurs.

Now to look back again to what the Emperor did before Metz, A guile to
pass amidst ones enemies without danger.
he traveled there with small advantage, all the thunder and strange
impetuositie of his artillery not able to make one hole or passage fit to give
the assault, which the Marquis Albert demanded of him; The Emperors battery
at Metz.
thinking thereby further to advance himself into his good favor, for that
having well near shaken all the great tower D'enfer, all the great part of
wall between the tower and the port Champenois, with the bulwark which
covered it, he could not raise the vaumure, otherwise termed fanse-braie, which
held up the quarters of the wall that fell, and were stayed the one upon the
other, between this vaumure and the foot of the wall, no ways filling of the
ditch, which remained as neat, large, and deep as before: nay, they served
them within for a stronger rampire. Mines begun to be made by the imperials
before Metz, to make a breach.
Wherefore it was thought good the battery should be changed to another
place a little above, and to undermine that part, to turn topsie turuie into
the ditch that same vaumure and fanse-braie: whereof the Duke of Guise being
advertised, he caused countermines to be made within in sundry places, in
which he might have any knowledge, and provide for their passages, in such
sort, as they had not long dug and hollowed their mines, but the sentinels
and scoutes of the besieged might easily hear and perceive them, the which
began to discourage them, to daunt and quayle greatly in their enterprise.
Join that then, as well by reason of the marvelous coals, as thorough the
necessities and defaultes of sundry things for the men of war, the very
Germans began even to fail of courage, who caused to be signified unto the
Emperor, that it would please his majesty to command a reasonable breach to
be made, to enter and take the town, choosing rather to die honorable at an
assault, than miserably to fall by cold and extreme famine. It was then that
the Emperor judging of the impossibility of the taking thereof, was pricked
with an acknowledgement of his fault, and with a great grief to have there
settled so evil a beginning, for seeing so shameful an end to so hot
desseines, yet to make them lift up their hearts, and encourage them to his
power, he promised them that if by the end of the year he did not make a
reasonable breach, he would give them leave to depart, which made them to
temporize, and take patience. Whereupon to make proof of this good affection,
he commanded again the Duke of Alua with all diligence to cause these mines
already begun to be continued and pursued, the which he did with so great
and fervent a desire, that he abandoned the work neither night nor day. But
the time was so contrary unto him, as all remained imperfect, wherefore if
then in the enemies camp every man failed of force and courage, the French
increased from hour to hour, making more and more continual sallies and
charges upon them, wherewith they daily diminished their army, for some stole
away, and retired by whole troops into their Countries, others in great
number were found stiff, and frozen within the trenches, lodgings, tents, and
quarters, and many pale, diseased in their livers, and dead for hunger, partly
for that they were so evil paid, the Emperors treasure being very much
consumed. Who seeing the term promised to the Germans to draw near, having
before his eyes a fearful kind of shame to return, without having done any
honorable action, himself being there in person, caused some to practice
with them, to sound them whether they would be content to go with him to besiege
Thoul, an imperial town, whereof men could not be able to finish the
fortification, by reason of the plague which had taken away so great a number
of the inhabitants. To which they made answer, that they had not deliberated
upon it, and they were commanded by the Princes and electors, not to pass
any further until Metz were first taken or yielded up. Therefore if it would
please his majesty to make any breach he opened as he promised, they were
all ready either to die there, or enter in: from this time about the
eighteenth of December he began to cause his best and greatest pieces of
artillery to retire. A little after having assembled together all his
Council, to conclude of an honorable retreat, it was commanded to the Earl
of Aiguemont, Colonel, and chief of two Regimentes of Cauallerie lodged at
Pont Camouson, to go down with his forces all alongest the river as far as
Thoul, and as much lower as was possible for him, to discover the Country, and
know what number of men of war might be there all along with the Duke of
Neuers, doubting least at his retreat some greater anoiances might be done
him. Whereupon this Earl departed with his Cauallerie from Pont Camouson, and
passing along the Mozelle as far as Thoul, caused it to be summoned in passing
thorough the suburbs, addressing his Trumpetter to D'esclauolles, who was the
governor. Who having understood the Chiamade, made a sign to him with his
hand that he should retire, albeit that he had just occasion to doubt upon
this summons, seeing the want of victualles, the town pregnable, and to be
battered on every side, evil provided of artillery and munitions, whereof
he advertised the Duke of Neuers, who was at Vaucouleurs. But the Gentleman of
his house who carried the news, named Torte esper, was taken by the way by
some of that Cauallerie, scattered to find some wandering booty as it befell
unto them, for having taken from him an hundred crowns which he had under his
faddle, they stripped him no further: but he showed himself so accord, as
finding himself half at liberty, he saved himself acrosse the wood,
thorough the darkness of the night, and so performed his message. And as
soon as the Duke of Neuers received this advertisement, he sent all night
long to fetch his men of war at the instant to come unto him, which was
lodged one or two leagues of. And Albeit that it was at a time of rest, and
that the most part were already asleep, his commandment notwithstanding
was, that every man should bring his armor on his back, and readily mount
on horseback. So they parted all the night with keeping a good watch, as it
was reason, because that this Earl approached as near them as they could,
and went upon the brinke of the river into a village called Dagny upon Meuse,
thinking to surprise them. But seeing the fire of all sides, hearing the noise
and neighing of horses, and by other tokens knowing how they had warning and
attended him, he retired back his ways, where returning up the river of
Mozell, he passed near unto a little town named Gondreuille, seated upon
the bank of that river, of the side of Nancie. On the other part a little
before was arrived the Baron of Guerres, which returned freshly from a road,
who not advertised of his enemies being so near him, wanted very little of
passing the river of Bac, which if he had done, as much had happened unto him
as did to some others that were of his company, who for having crossed the
river aleady on the enemies side, were surpised, some hurt, others taken
prisoners, and few or none killed or slain, the Baron saved himself within
the little town, and was not rigorously pursued, as well for the darkness of
the night, as the fear which they had least they should be charged upon.
That very same night was S. Simon, a Gentleman of the house of the Duke of
Neuers sent with five and twentye horse as far as Thoul, to understand of
Esclauolles the success of the enterprise above said. Upon whose report
Fouronne, a Gentleman of his house, was forthwith dispatched and sent by the
Duke of Neuers to advertise the King of all the proceedinges. Who in short
answer sent unto him, and prayed him to search out by all means possible
that he could, how that town of Thoul might be preserved, and hold out
only for fifteen days, within which time he would not fail himself to
come to succor it with all his power. The Duke upon this answer, would not
put any other in trust with this charge, but reserving it unto himself, the
two and twentieth of December followed by Bordillon, De Bigny master of the Q.
householde, d'Eschenets and de Giry Ensign of his company, he went and lodged
within the town thus unprovided. As soon as the Duke was there arrived, he
made the round upon the walls about the town, and visited a beginning of
rampires and platformes, which D'Escauolles had begun to frame within, the
which was found to be excellently well invented by the ingeners and masters of
fortifications, whom he caused to come thither, to consider of, and address
the disposing and finishing of this fortification, enterprised and imprinted so
deeply in his affection, that there remained not one man about his person, to
whom he gave not some commission, and he himself the most part of the time
stirred not, interrupting the ordinary hours of his meals, so greatly was he
affectionate to that work, that there rested very small time that he saw
not some platform made up in defense, which carried his name, De Bordillon was
as busy about another, and they seemed to be almost jealous of the perfection
of their works. Besides, he made search to be made throughout all the houses,
garners, and sellers, and to take an oath of all those which inhabited there,
to know what corn, wines, haie, fourage, and of every kind of victuals
might be within the Town, to the end that order might be taken therein. But
there was a small deal found, having been carried away before by the
Burgesses and those which were retired to other places for fear of the plague,
and that which remained within the town was consumed and spoiled without
reason, by the souldyers, and such as remained there during this peril. Then
being informed how that into two little towns, Thoul, and Gondeuille, great
quantity was carried as well out of the plain Country, as little towns and
French lands, for fear of the enemies, he sent to summon them, and gave
commandment that it should be brought and stored up within Thoul. To
Gondeuille was sent Eschenets, followed a far off by an Ensign of footmen,
with a certain number of horse. The Provost and the inhabitants, after some
difficulties, saw themselves so suddenly surprised, that in the end they
advised themselves to obey. They of Thoul grew stubborn, forgetting themselves
in the regard of Mouie, who was sent unto them with fifty, horse of the Duke
of Neuers his company, and an Ensign of fanterie, to summon them to obey the
Kings Lieutenant. Notwithstanding after his honest persuasions, seeing the
Provost contestate, and at his dissembled presumption the inhabitants
rebellious, he caused the town presently to be scaled, and taken as she was
by assault, they somewhat felt the payment of their refusal. Mouie
notwithstanding caused the fury of the French souldyers to cease, already
heated at the slaughter. The Ensign of Fanterie remained and lodged there,
until that all the victuals which were within were carried to Thoul, without
taking or carrying away any thing, thereby to maintain them always in their
Neutralitie: so all victuals and munition were carried to Thoul from all
parts, by the commandment of the general, with so good order, as every man
lived somewhat better, and with more discretion than before. And after having
considered how in case the siege should be, the town would be very ill
provided of footmen, he caused four other companies to enter in, which made
up the number of eighteen hundred fantassins, and some light horse, over and
above the ordinary garrison.

The Duke of Neuers being hereupon advertised, The Emperor upon the point to
retire from Metz.
how the Emperor even longed to retire himself, and how his army every day
broke and diminished, seldom suffered any day to pass without sending some
people over the Country to hasten their going: so as oftentimes in stead of
aduauncing forward, they caused them to recoyle back enough with a number of
prisoners which they took. Notwythstanding they found them in so great
poverty, as they were feign to let them pass without any harm doing. In
this estate remained they until the last day of the month of December, that
the Emperor understanding of the taking of the castle of Hedin, seeing
himself to fall and to diminish of every thing, fearing besides the return
of the Kings army, and to fall into greater loss, was one of the first which
retired on new years day, leaving all the charge to the Duke of Alua, for the
departing of his army, and ordering of the retreat. As soon as his departure
was known throughout the camp, the ways and villages round about were
suddenly full of souldyers, which retired themselves, the one into their
quarter, the other whether they were able, in so great misery, as very
beasts, were they never so cruel, would have taken pity of those miserable
soldiers, falling and staggering along the high ways in extreme necessity,
and most commonly dying near the hedges, and at the roots of bushes, to
become a pray to dogs and birds. And which is yet more to be lamented by
men of courage, to be enforced to die so poorelye, without having made any
great proof at all of their valor. The which ought greatly to move the hearts
of such men, as God has rendered so happy in this world, that they never
felt nor assayed the hardness of war. And when they speak with a full belly
and the cup in their hand, it seems unto them a wedding, to live in such
an estate as consists not in thousand and thousand of perils, more than in
the danger both of soul and body, except it be wisely and justly executed.
Not to loose any time upon the intelligence which the Duke of Neuers had
received, he sent Mouie, and the Captain Andre de May More, with about five
hundred horse, as well of men at arms, as harguebuziers on horseback, to put
on their spurs against the inhabitants of the County, retyring themselves
into their quarters, where there wanted very little, that the son of
Granuelle, the Baron of Carlaon, and others, had not been there stayed, but
doubting themselves of that coming, by slack and long treates, they saved
themselves. Having failed of this their first enterprise, they at one treat
went at the point of day to lie in ambuscade near Ramberuilliers, within which
was a Commissarie of victualles, which came from the Franche comte to the
Emperor, and the master of the money of Besanson, with two other merchants
which brought great quantity of all kind of victualles and provisions. The
commissaries and merchants were before horsed and guided by a Lorrainer, who
served for a spy, by whom the Duke of Neuers was certainly advertised what
he was to put in execution for their surprisall. Wherefore as they were in
ambuscade near enough to the town, Andre de May sent certain Italian
souldyers, which were to advertise the ambuscade, by a sign if they entered,
and gain the port upon the gardes, so as faining to come from the imperial
camp, and to endure great cold and hunger, they lamented so much, as they
were let to go seek some victuals. Anon after some other came thither, who
did as the first, and in such wise as seeming strong enough to repulse the
gards from the ports, who were but Lorain pesa^ts armed with old bills, rotten
staves, and rustie brigandines, Andre speaking excellent good Spanish, was no
sooner arrived, but the soldiers who were advertised of the sign made them,
charged upon the porters half asleep, and the rest drunk, of whom some
were massacred, other constrained to abandon the gates, which were a little
after opened to all the rest of the ambuscade, who being advertised thereof,
courageously entered in. I leave you to think what good husbandry there was
made. The Comissarie was found there hid in the bedstrawe, and with these
merchants was carried prisoner to Thoul, the victuals and provisions
dispearsed, and spoiled as much as they could. They did as much at Espinau, a
castle situate upon Mozelle and Rimiremont, where great violence was offered
to the Abbess and Ladies, especially by the Italians which were newly come
from the Emperous camp to the Kings service. The Duke of Neuers had sent
Chastellus Lieutenant of Bordillons company, toward Metz with like number of
Cauallerie, to learn out and make a certain report of the truth of this
retrait. Who passing by the Pont Camouson, found that the Count of Aiguemont
with his regiment of Cauallerie was departed thence: where was only remaining
a great number of miserable sick creatures. From whence he passed as far as
Metz, where he found that the Dukes of Alua and Brabanson, with the greatest
part of the imperial army were dislodged in strange disorder, Retreat of the
imperial army before Metz.
departing in the night with two fires only for signal, the most secretly
that they could, without any noise, trumpets, fifes, and drums sleeping, the
tents left behind, and great quantity of all sorts of harness and weapons,

reported unto me the Translator, by the most renowned Lord C. H. L. high

narowly escaping, being of the suit of the Vidasme of Chartres, in all those
wars.
remaining for hostages, an incredible multitude of sick persons, toward whom
the Duke of Guise, and the rest of the chief, even to the simplest French
soldiers, used most great charity, furnishing them with all necessaries, and
such relief as poor sick strangers had need of. Upon the tail charged the
Vidasme of Charstres, so as having defeated a company of light horse, and
caused a great deal of their powder which he had taken away in their sight
to be burned, he returned with more prisoners than he was willing, without the
loss of any one of his own. The Marquis Albert remained the last to serve
for help and arreregard, not without great pain and hazard, thorough the
continual alarums which day and night he received. Besides that, he prayed
the Duke of Neuers to hasten him to go, so as the third of January he departed
from Thoul with his men at arms, and cauallerie, and three Ensigns of
fanterie, accompanied with Bordillon and sundry other Gentlemen and Captains.
After he went to dine at Pont Camouson, where the rest of that day he tarryed
to hear news of the Marshall of Saint Andre, who was gone the lower way:
having in like sort sent Mouie to the Duke of Guise, praying him to advertise
him of the resolution of that affayre, whose answer he attended. But
Chastellus being returned, and by him assured of the whole, especially how the
Marquis sought all means to save himself and retire, he went forwards
toward Metz with two hundred horse. The rest of that day the Princes took
great pleasure to see the brave sallies and skirmishes of their soldiers. Upon
the Marquis and his Germans whom they went to seek out in their own forte,
and give them thrusts of pikes, and harquebuze shot even within their tents,

to provoke them to come out into the plain to fight, which they would not
do but by constraint, keeping still close together, and united, without
breaking or seuering themselves. In this estate and pain were they constrained
to tarry from morning until night, not once daring to enlarge themselves so
much as to seek out victuals. For as soon as they were found in any small
number, by and by, by the Marangetz and Fouillardz, villains of the Country,
they had their throats cut, and were defeated. Wherewith being the more
annoyed, they ought rather to come out as the French desired, considering that
they could not enforce them but with great loss. Therefore to the end they
might the more vex them, the Duke caused four mean Culuerines to be placed
in a little Island above Pont au Mores, which shot even within them. In sum,
they did so sore annoye them, as two days after the Marquis having lost the
better part of his men, departed thence in a far less number than he came
with, taking his way toward Treuues. He was a little followed after, and
they made a good market with his people, being combatted enough with cold,
famine, and other miseries. But the French moved with pity made no account
thereof: but in stead of tormenting them, they opened unto them the passage,
and suffered the members to go scotfree, wishing only that they might have
gotten the head to have paid for all.

The Duke of Guise advertised the King by Randan of all the success of his
siege, Thankesgiuings to God by the French for the siege raised at Metz.
who after having yielded thanks unto God for so good an issue, commanded
that they should make publyke and general processions throughout his Realm, to
praise and thank God of so great and especial a grace for all France. The
Duke of Guise did the like at Metz with a general procession, where he
himself was present with all humility and devotion, as also did the rest of
the Princes and Lords which accompanied him, to wit, the Princes of D'anguien,
de Conde, Montpensier, la Roche Suryon, de Nemours, Horace Farneze, Pierre
Strossie, le Vidasme de Chartres, Montmorencie, D'anuille, de Gonor, governor
of Metz, De la Brosse, Lieutenant of the Duke of Lorraines company, and De la
Rochefoucaut, the Vizecount of Turaine, and De Martiques, D'elangues,
Entragues, De Biron, and Saint Remy, and generally all the Captains,
Gentlemen, and souldyers which remained after the siege. Afterward having
ordered the garrison which should remain there within, and disposed of all the
rest of the affairs, the musters being taken as well of the men at arms as the
fanterie, he gave leave to all to go repose and refresh themselves in their
own houses, and he himself went to the Court, leaving De Gonnor to command in
his place.

During the time that the Emperor patiently carried the misfortune happened
unto him, under a hope of a more favorable to come, and as he retired to the
Low Countries, he excused himself toward the Princes and Cities of the
Empire of so pitiful success, laying it upon the slacknes of their forces
and means. For which cause, said he, he was enforced to set upon that place
in the dead of winter: The King of France triumphed over his miseries, and
increasing them by his Letters and Embassages to all Christian Princes, the
more to diminish the authority and credit of his enemy, whose power he
said was altogether broken by the issue of so miserable a siege, passed the
most part of the times for revenge of so great raines and sickness, as had
been endured by the continuance of the wars passed, in ease and reioycings
which he took in feastings, tiltings, turney, and other royal pleasures,
among which, the marriage made at Paris with rare magnificence, between Horace
Farneze Duke of Castres, and the Lady Diana his natural daughter, was most
famous. But the Emperor prompt and active in his actions, pricked besides with
an extreme desire of revenge, which by all means in all places he practiced,
soon troubled this good cheer, for in the beginning of the spring, with such
a number as he was able to assemble, and first under the conduct of du Reux
he sent to besiege Terroanne. But prevented by death, that charge was given to
Binecourt, a knight esteemed one of the most sweet and gracious among them.
That City, albeit that it was little of circuit, had a renown great enough
throughout all Europe, of which the Romans make honorable mention in their
writings. It was situated upon the little river of Liz, in the confines of
Gaul Belgique, a nation of a long time esteemed warlyke by the
historiographers, called by the Latins Morini, now they call it the Cauntie of
Ponthieu somewhat near the great Ocean sea, in situation somewhat hanging,
environed with fens and marshes, woods, and great forests. Besides,
curiously fortified by the Kings of France, to whose hands it has a long
time since been fallen, to serve them as a bulwark and frontire as well
against the English, as Flemings and Hanuiers, among which it is enclosed,
having done a thousand spoils, and an hundred sundry enterprises, which they
would attempt upon Picardie. Wherefore it was once clean raised and made even
to the earth by the Englishmen, and there was salt sown in sign of eternal
ruin. But yet is it much more odious to the Flemings, Burgonians, and
Hanuiers, who for this occasion importunately induced the Emperor to this
enterprise. Now for so much as it was esteemed impregnable, and that as well by
intelligence, as other considerations not thought, that the Emperor would
convert his forces to that place, but rather into Champagne, toward Mezieres
and Yuoy, they had not so carefully furnished it with victuals and sure
munition, as was requisite for so long a siege. Whereof the neighbors being
advertised, the enemies used so great diligence, that it was suddenly
besieged, De Losses being alone, within the principal and chief, with his
light horse and some people of the Country, in no great number, nor of any
great defense. Ioyn that thorough the covetousness and negligence of former
governors, a thing natural to us French men, this key remained bare and
unfurnished of all provisions: therefore it was necessary to make a virtue of
necessity, and where prudence could not take place, there it was necessary
that force should second it. In such sort, as even in the beard of the enemy,
and in spite of them, being as men judged for the most part not used to the
art of wars, they strengthened it with men, victuals, and whatsoever they
were able. D'esse, otherwise called Panuilliers, knight of the order, most
renoumed for his virtue and prowess, being sent thither Lieutenant for the
King, and with him Frances of Montmorencie, eldest son to the Constable, with
the most part of their companies, followed with a great number of other Lords,
Gentlemen and souldyers, who entered therein to seek for honor: and the rest
following their Captains to defend and keep the place. But as such a
victualling thereof despighted the Emperor, and making him obstinate,
reiterated his despite, to cause it to be battered and assaulted, the King
contrariwise assuring himself of an impossibility to force it, slacked it in
such sort, as without any other succors or preparatiues, he left his enemy
to do whatsoever he listed. For albeit that they within, and the Duke of
Vendosme with the men at arms of the garrisons about, impeached and gave
alarums unto them as much as was possible, yet their number being much greater
and stronger than the French, they could not so hinder them, but that they made
their approaches, where they themselves thought best even to plant their
battery where they pleased, and knew might most annoy the town, putting the
very mouth of their artillery nearest, and upon the brinke of the ditch
between the castle and the tower Du Chapitre, upon a little hill where the
gallows stood hard by. Having brought from many towns and castles of
Flanders and Artois all sorts of Artillery, with innumerable munitions of
powder and bullets. So glad was that nation to see it environed, that not only
women and little children ran thither, but for joy sung songs, and vulgar
rimes, carrying and bringing into the camp all sorts of grain, drinks,
beasts, and other victuals by heaps, which made their army seem far
greater in number; than well furnished of good soldiers.

Their battery began about the end of June, strange and furious enough: but
albeit the bullets fell as thick within the town, as great hailestones out of
the sky, and that there was not upon the rampires, thorough the streets or
within the houses, any sure place and without danger, yet they within besieged
were smally seared therewith. Now making continual sallies and recharges upon
their enemies in the midst of these thickes and smoakes, they sought them out,
and by heaps beat them within their own forts and trenches, and sometimes
constrained them to abandon their trenches, and had leisure enough to stick up
some of their pieces with nails, and set their powder on fire, so as they
dragged into the town one of their culuerines, and after shot many shootes at
them, albeit the great store of artillery and munition which was continually
brought to the camp, hourly repaired any disorder or annoyance, which the
French with great labor and danger could do them, being a far greater
loss to loose one man besieged, than ten besieging. Upon this the tempest and
thundering battery of the enemies grew greater daily, and there remained not
within the town, tower, or turret, to the least battlement that fell not to
the ground, there was not any defense without or within, which they raised
not. Briefly, in seeing it thus battered, and thrown down, one would easily
believe that they determined to lay it all to dust. They within without any
respect at all of their own lives, to the same place whether they saw the
bullets bend, from moment to moment carried upon their backs earth, faggots,
turfes, and dung, which notwithstanding much weakened them by reason of the
continual toil which they in the day had to rampire, and in the night to
watch, to keep sentinel, and sustain diverse alarums with little rest, for a
necessity practicing the office of soldiers and laborers both together, by
reason of the small number of artificers and pioners, and less store of any
necessary tools that was in the town at a pinch, as pickaxes, spades,
shouelles, mattockes, crows, and such sort of iron works, whereof they stood
in so great need, as the soldiers within were constrained to peck the ground
with spits, daggers, fire shouels, and as a man may say, even scratch it with
their nails: for which and such like wantes, many towns in France have been
gotten by the enemy, albeit that they were well furnished besides for good
men: for help whereof, and to give some rejoicing to the long travel of the
besieged, they caused the Captain Grille to enter in with one hundred
harguebuziers on horseback. The which he bravely enterprised and executed,
and with such conduct, as having forced the watch, with small loss of any of
his soldiers he entered in, in the sight of them all, which greatly increased
their courage. The same day they made a sallie in like sort out upon them
luckily enough; and made their retreat like men of war, without receiving
the worse. But that nation showed it self so great an enemy to this poor
miserable town, that she forgot nothing whereby she might make her extreme
desire appear, of seeing the total destruction thereof, and how much by day
and night they ceased not to torment it, by all means which they could
possibly imagine, by so much more increased the courage of the French, to
repulse them back, for in less than one hour they had made up the rampire
without the ladder, where they perceived the artillery to begin to shake the
wall, and made stronger in an instant, what in one day had been thrown down,
then it was before. Notwithstanding the lightning of their artillery was so
terrible and violent thundering without intermission, as there was neither
rampire, bank, nor defense which it turned not over without remedy, the which
continued so furiously for the space of near hand ten days together. Within
which time the enemies supposing that they had made a breach reasonable and
great enough, as in deed it was of threescore paces long, the wall, rampire,
and all the defenses as well of the castle as the great tower being broken
down and battered, no more remaining but a little mount which they within had
caused to be made, and the parapect and top of the ditch, which was yet
strong, and hard for them to mount up unto, notwithstanding that as well with
the quarters and ruins of the wall, as with faggots and hurdles, they did what
they could to fill up the ditch, to make the scale more easy. That being
known to those within, they resolved to abide them, and you may easily believe
that they left nothing in their lodgings that was not brought out. After many
vollies of artillery, as well from the mountain, which gave right on the
back of the besieged, willing to defend the breach, as from that which shot in
face of them on the river side, with a great noise of Fifes, A furious assault
to Terroane by the Fleminges and Hanuiers, held out by the French.
Drums, Trumpets, and diverse cries after their manner, they went furiously to
the assault of all parts, carrying ladders and all kind of engines to scale
and force the town, and there was that day a most marvelous combat seen. For
if the enemies were wilful to enter in, much more had the French a better will
to defend themselves and repulse them. There could one have seen nothing but
wild fire, and unquenchable crackling of armor, and al kind of weapons,
pittious cries of those which were burned, maimed, turned over, and drawing
toward death: generally all sorts of most terrible and furious executions,
for the space of more than ten long hours, the enemies refreshing themselves
three times. In the end the resolute constancy of the besieged prevailed, and
vanquished the obstinacy of the imperials, repulsing them with a great
butcherie of their most brave men, not without great loss of them that kept
it, among whom the valiant Knight De Hesse lost his life, whose prowess was
already renowned beyond the frontiers of France in many places, namely in
the Islands of England and Scotland, as also did De Viennes, De Beaudisne, De
la Rocheposay, De Blandie, and the Captain Ferriers, all men of mark, and of
laudable conduct, with other valiant Gentlemen and soldiers.

The King being advertised how courageously his men behaved themselves,
persuaded himself that to so victorious a beginning, there could not ensue
but a most happy end, A stratageme of the Captains, Breuill and Saint Romain.
without ordaining any further succors for this little town almost torn in
pieces of all parts, saving only that he caused De Hedin, the Captain
Breuil, and S. Romain with about three hundred footmen, to assaie if they could
enter in. Which they most fortunatly performed, not without great danger and
hazard of their persons, the enemies having with their trenches and mounts
compassed and environed the town round about, even so far as to place their
Corpse de gnets within the ditches, who being never a whit the more cooled nor
discouraged for that, fought daily hand to hand with the French which kept the
breach, and grew much more earnest in returning unto it, assaying by all force
possible to carry it away, and did not only give fire to diverse hollow
mines in sundry places, the most part whereof they found false and vented, but
they beside practiced a slight never before used, which was to dig under the
parapect and back of the ditch, being very hard and uneasy to mount up to
the breach, all the flankers and defenses (as I have told you) being raised
and broken down with the artillery, having made certain Taudis, which they
call Mancelets, in fashion of blinders, only to cover them from hand strokes
and stones, whilst that they did approach to the foot of the breach, under
which they hollowed and trained, their mine as themselves could desire. Whereat
the French maruelling enough, persuaded themselves that the enemies were not
able to hollow and dig so far as under their feet, which were above them
upon the breach, but rather that they would draw out the earth from under the
castle, or the great tower Du Chapitre, but contrariwise they still dug
under the parapect, the length of the very breach, holding up the burden with
shores and piles, fylling the ditch full of the earth which they drew out. The
work being finished, and fire put thereto, it happened that one part of this
parapect was blown up, and fell within the ditch, and the rest sunk in a heap,
swallowing up many French souldyers, Terroane surprised ^ppon the terms of
composition.
the which made the mouth of the breach far greater, and so easy, as a man at
arms might mount up on horseback armed at all pieces. Whereupon Frances of
Montmorencie, according to the counsel of all the Captains which were within
with him, considering how there was no more means to defend the town or make
any resistance, advised at the least how to save the persons, and demanded
composition, which was granted unto him. But whilst that they parlyed, the
Germans and Burgonians entered in at diverse places, and thereuppon the old
Spanish Ensigns ran up the great breach, crying, Fair wars, fair wars.
Whereupon some French men drew to them with their pikes, and stretched out
their hands unto them to keep them from being murdered by the Germans. The
cruelty of the Germans and Burgonians at the taking of Terroane.
Nothing being able to be otherwise concluded by this composition by reason
of such a surprisall, where you might have seen most strange cruelties which
the Germans and Burgonians committed, speaking of nothing but cutting of
throats, so as the miserable French men esteemed themselves most happy to fall
prisoners into the hands of more gracious Lords, from whose fury hardly
could Frances de Montmorencie save himself, who only remained there within
lieutenant for the king, whom in seeking to cover and defend, D'ouartie was
sore set upon and hurt in his presence, yet afterward he was known and
carried prisoner to Binecourt, the Emperors Lieutenant. The other more
apparent prisoners, as the Vicount de Martiques, The principal prisoners taken
within Terroane
Dampierre, de Losses, Baudiment, Bailet, de S. Romain, the Captains Grille,
le Breul, and Saint Roman yielded themselves to diverse masters, as the hazard
gave them leave: and forasmuch as the simple soldiers were the first which
entered in, and not the captains or Lords of authority, such prisoners as
could readily make any money, went out good cheap, as the Vicount De
Martiques, Dampierre, de Saint Roman, and the Captain Breul. But such as

and in great danger there to abide by it long. The surplus of the soldiers
found at the Spaniards hands (to whose mercy the most part were fallen) an
honest entertainment, taking of such as had means reasonable ransom, and the
poor having stripped them of their weapons and best stuff, they sent back
safely, and oftentimes themselves conducted them. Within this little town was
found a great deal of good and gross artillery, chiefly two very fair and
long Culuerines.

In this time the great Turk Sultan Soliman carried himself too rigorously
toward the person of Sultan Mustapha his eldest son, which he had of a
slave. Soliman the great Turk causes his son to be slain.
Who having been sent with his mother from his first youth into the province
of Amafia, which was given unto him, was so well and carefully brought up, as
he there achieved great honor and amity, not only of all in that Country,
but thoroughout all the governments of his Father. This mother being absent;
Soliman took another slave unto him named Roza, of whom he had four other
sons, Mahomet, Bajazet, Selim, Giangir the crook back, and one daughter,
which was married to Bassa Rostan. Roza being endued with admirable beauty,
accompanied with all the flattering delights and allurements which possibly one
could imagine, Religion lightl^ a color for any villainy.
knew so well how to play her part toward Soliman, who was as it were a
man ravished, that by the help of Muchthy (as much to say, as the sovereign
Priest of the law of Mahomet) and under color of religion, she was not only
made free of condition, but lawful wife and spouse of Soliman, to which never
any before her attained. Raised now unto such honor, and seeing her self
entirely beloved, she had no greater care than how to establish the Empire
unto one of her children after the death of the father. But foreseeing that the
singular virtues of Mustapha would be so far contrary thereunto, that
whilst he lived she should never have rest, (because that he had gotten the
love of the men of war, and how the eyes of all men were upon him, for the
great hope of his magnanimious courage and singular dexterity) she studied as
much as she could to make him become odious to Soliman, to which her son in
law greatly aided her, for that he as then governed all the affairs. Her
reasons were, how that Mustapha building upon the love and favor which he
had gotten of all men, thorough his great liberality, courage, and dexterity
of spirit, burned with such a longing to reign, as every man feared least in
affecting the Empire, he would shorten the days of Soliman, as already Selim
had done to his father. Therefore she urged Soliman, and besought him with
many and great tears that he would take order therein, thereby to provide for
his own safety. Now albeit in the beginning she smally prevailed, and that
Mustapha had well discovered the crossebarres which she ordinarilye prepared
for him, yet she never ceased to continue, by the help of a Jew, a most
renowned inchantresse, who having given unto her certain drugs, she caused
the amity of Soliman to be redoubled toward Roza, so well, as she assured
her self of a good event at the last to her enterprises, albeit a delaie might
be for a time. Finally, after many practices, she found means to suborne the
governor of Mustapha, and caused him to write (though falsely) unto Soliman,
how his son meant to take in marriage the daughter of the King of Persia.
This old man moved by the continual plaintes of Roza and Rostan, easily gave
credit to these news and false aduertisements, so as in the year 1552.
having caused a brute to run of the Persians coming down into Syria, he
sent Rostan thither with a puisant army, for (under color of going to meet
with his enemies) to ceaze upon Mustapha, and bring him prisoner to
Constantinople, with express commandment to kill him, if otherwise he
could not take him. But Mustapha advertised of the whole matter, and how that
the Persians were not at all in the field, came toward him with seven
thousand men of the best experienced in the wars, which caused Rostan to make
a quick return without doing ought. Whereat Soliman being the more
provoked, the next year caused the same brute again to run, and how having
leauied a great army he meant to go himself in person against the Persians.
Being arrived in Syria, he commanded his son to come unto him to his camp.
Mustapha knowing how it was him alone which they shot at, albeit he was prayed
and greatly solicited to avoid the fury of his Father, and retire himself
into some other part, trusting in his own innocence, and thinking it a matter
more commendable and worthy of his greatness, to die in obeying of his
Father, than living, to incur a note of infamy and treason, yea, though
thereby he, might gain the Empire of the whole world: thinking in like sort,
that for that he never made any refusal, by his own presence he might
appease the fury of his father went on his way thither, but being entered
within Solimans tent, he was suddenly taken and strangled in his own
presence, after at the same instant, the Bassa his head of the Province of
Amasia, was stroke off. This cruelty being come to the knowledge of Giangir,
the crook back, one of the rest of the four brothers, he manfully rejected
the gift and spoil which his father had presented unto him, so that lamenting
the death of his brother, he could not command himself, nor refrain from
uttering these speeches.

Ha cruel Traitor, I cannot say Father, take now to thy self the treasures,
the Horses, the Tapistrie, and the Province of Mustapha, and govern it at
thine own pleasure: could it fall into thy thought O infamous man! and without
humanitye, to cause to dye against all law, so valiant a personage as never
was nor never will be the like in all the house of Ottomans? Ha, ha, it shall
not be true, and I will take order, that thou shall never be able impudentlye
to vaunte, that ever thou did the like to me poor Crookebacke: and at the
instant drawing out his dagger, he stabbed himself so far into the body,
as he fell down stark dead, which being known to his Father, he
maruelouslye mourned, and notwithstanding he spared not to sease of all his
goods, which caused a great tumulte in Mustapha his Camp, but it was nothing
in respect of that they did after they understood of his death. In such sort
as Solomon with great danger of his life, was constrained to banishe Rostan,
and deprive him of all honors and dignities. This death fell out very
fortunatelye for the Christians, to whom Mustapha was a sore enemy, and took
singular pleasure in shedding of their blood: it was likewise taken so
greeuouslye of the Turks, that from thence forth this proverb is grown among
them, Gietti Sultan Mustapha, all is ended since that he is dead, all is done
whatsoever we thought of: for they imagined in their own fancy that it was he
which should enlarge the bounds of their Empire in another manner of sort then
ever did his Ancestors, which they could not expect at the hands of any other.

Let us handle again the siege of Teroene.

The Emperor lying at Bruxelles, and being promptlye advertised of the taking
of Teroene, conceived a very great pleasure thereat, Teroene razed to the
foundation by the Emperors commandment.
sweetening by the hap of this good fortune, the bitterness of his former
disgraces, so as throughout all the Countries of Flaunders, Arthois, and
Henaute were seen great bonfyers. Afterward he commanded that it should be
razed and thrown down to the very foundations, to the end naught might rest
but the place, where it might be said Teroene had been. Afterward he sent
the Prince of Piemont his Nephewe Lieutenant general in his army, to quench
a sedition and a certain envy which the Princes and great Lords bare to
Binecourt a worthy Chief of these troops. But such is the malice among men,
that it was never, nor ever shall be, but that envy will be among equalles,
albeit that often times it may lie dissembled.

The King understood of these sorrowful news as soon as the Emperor, which
at the instant seemed as strange unto him, as any thing which they could have
made report of, considering how he had before received an entire contentment
of that furious assault which the French had so resolutely sustained: but
being certified by diverse reports how all the matter was handled, he was
greatly grieved at the taking thereof, and much more bewailed his men, which
he thought to be in a far greater number dead, then afterward it was found
to be. Now albeit that among the French the plainte was great, and the loss
very prejudicial, yet necessitye (the inuentresse and mistress of all Arts)
sharpning the wits of men to assay strange things, stirred up the Kings spirit
in a sort, ioynte with the sorrow and grief of the loss, so that being
advertised how his enemies shortly after this ruin took their way, and
prepared themselves to come and do as much at Hedin, he made ready all
preparatiues to fortify the same with men, and all things fitting to stay
them short, or at the least until such a time as he imagined his army
could be in a readiness, to the end to raise the siege and drive them into
their own Country. Now the D. of Bouillon Marshall of France, desirous more
and more to persevere in the K. service, The D. of Bouillon within Hedin,
Lieutenant for the King.
had long time before undertaken the defense of this Castle, to which would
needs accompany him Horace Farneze D. of Chastres, and the Earl of Villars,
with a great number of other Lords, Gentlemen, and good Soldiers, who to make
proof of their courage, of their own accord presented themselves to this
service, albeit that the K. stood in some doubt of the force and validity of
that place, and had no affection at all to expose thither such personages of
such authority: they notwithstanding preferring an immortal renown before
their goods or lives, went to enclose themselves within this forte: to this
very end were dispatched couriers and commandments to the Captains of the
men of war, to have in readiness all their companies, and as soon as it were
possible to cause them to march and to render themselves near Amyens, where
the Constable was, hoping to assemble together there the Kings army,
commissions were distributed to the Captains of the Fanterie, to make their
leuies as soon as they were able, and to those of the old Ensigns, and
entertained companies to furnish them complete, and well armed to conduct them
surely, and without plaints unto the Rendeuous: there was also proclaimed
throughout all the Realm, that the Rirebands according to their duty, and the
Kings ordinance, should forthwith march and furnish themselves to the same
place, afterward they advertised and besought the Zuizer cantons of the French
league, to send to their succor a certain number of footmen of their nation,
the best armed and complete that they could, according to the agreement
between the Kings of France and them. The King in sum caused great diligence
to be made, and commanded that all things should be provided for the putting
of his power into the field, Great diligence used by the imperials to besiege
Hedin.
where his enemies being advertised and well assured, that if they did not
employ that small time which they could get, (within which the Kings army
might be made ready) so to purpose as they might enforce Hedin, hardly they
should attain to the chief of their enterprise, or retire without a battle,
or other peiudiciall accident: they advanced with such diligence their
affairs, that the Town being void of inhabitants, (who were fled and retired
into France with whatsoever they could carry away of their goods) was in very
short time taken by them, in respect it was not much defended by Soldiers, who
shut up themselves within the Castle, esteeming it impregnable. There they
planted on the one side one of their batteries, and the other toward the
park, and the greatest of all by the Tower Robin, where the French had already
made theirs, but notwithstanding any resistance which they within besieged were
able to make, they were not able to diuerte them. This Castle being little,
which in all could contain but 2000. men, and that hardly having in times past
been builded by the Dukes of Burgondie, only for the pleasure of hunting, and
not to fortify it in any sort, so not loosing one sole hour by day or night
to batter it so furiouslye as was possible, they travailed not only to throw
it down by their artillery, but undermined it so diversely and in so many
places, that it was impossible that a Cony berry could have more holes and
hollowes under the ground, then were under the foundations of this castle,
Hedin besieged, battered, undermined, taken, and sacked by the Imperials.
all the countermines and secrets within being known and practiced by many of
the enemies, the place besides being very subject to this imperfection. Now the
enemies had already battered and dug down the greatest part of the
parapette and rampire of the great breach, where a great number of valiant men
remained, and already given a false assault, when all the dangers were
declared to the D. of Bouillon, and withal the irrecouerable loss of so many
brave men as were within so vile a place, the taking of Teroane serving them
for a fresh example, without comparison far stronger then that Castle,
wherefore of every side were proposed terms of composition, the which the
Prince of Piemont willingly enough agreede unto, standing assured how the
chieftaines which defended that place were men of valor, and the soldiers
full cunning at such an occupation, considering likewise that the time was very
short to make any long temporising, curious besides to get good cheap, whereby
afterward he might the better employ his army to matter of greater
consequence. But as the Gentlemen and Trumpetters went from the one side to the
other, to resolve of the composition already in good forwardnes, nothing
resting but the deliuerye of hostages on both sides, and the signing with the
Princes hand, two misfortunes happened to the French: the one, that a Priest
not wittingly as since it was known, but through lack of foresight or some
secret malediction, set on fire such works and preparations as they had made
ready to abide the assault: the other, that the Bourgonians greedy of the pray,
by the sweetenes which they found in the sack of Teroane, gave fire to the
trains of their mines, fearing to be frustrate of so great a booty as they
expected: so as one part of the Soldiers being burned and consumed in these
fires, another swallowed up and perished in this gulf of smoking mines, the
rest which were a very few astonished as if they had fallen from the clouds,
without daring to make any resistance, in respect they were forbidden to stir
from their places, or move their weapons, attending the Princes signing and
confirmation, were surprised and found themselves at the mercy of their
enemies, before they ever thought them as yet to have been entered. The Prince
of Piemont knowing this adventure so happily fallen out for him and better the^
he hoped for, would not afterward sign what he had before promised,
forgetting all the precedents, through the joy which he had for the recovering
of that place, and the prisonners at so easy a rate. So as presently mounting
up the great breach, he entered the Castle to go to the D. of Bouillon, who as
soon as he perceived him, moved with an extreme choler, which made him
forget all fear of death, said unto him: why how now Sir, is this the keeping
of your promise? will you not send such hostages unto me as you promised, and
perform what is agreede between you and me? to whom the Prince answered with
a smile, sufficient testimony of his joy, how that he had spoken too late, and
how it was no more needful to give hostages when all his people were already
within. In sum, that after many speeches the resolution was, that they should
remain prisonners, to wit, the D. of Bouillon chief and lieutenant for the K.
De Riou Governor, La Lobe Ensign of the Dukes company, the Earl of Vilars,
De Pry Lieutenant of his company, De Guenon guidon, De Vanze Marshall of the
lodgings, the Baron of Culan, De Marets Lieutenant of De Riou his company of
foot, with sundry other, whom seeing by appearance to be of some mark, he would
needs have their names, and afterward more ransom then otherwise he had: so
this Castle was again recovered by the imperials the 18. of July, after the
death of Horace Farneze D. of Castres, whom a bullet of a great piece carried
away, and hard by him De Magny a renowned gentleman in the feats of arms,
there died also the Vicecount of Martigues, Horace Farneze D. of Castres, De
Magny, the Vicount of Martigues, Moninuille Cizieux, Dampierre, Lusignan, and
others dead at Hedin.
who being delivered out of prison at Teroane, presently repaired to this
castle, having always spent his time in many honorable actions: Moninuille of
the house of Amboise, de Cizeux Co^missioner of the wars, the C. Lusignan
ensign to De Riou, De Dampierre, who had likewise been prisonner at Teroane,
and came again thither with the Seneschall of Castres, and Captain Vifargent,
who were sunk within the Mines, the Captain Malestrot Lieutenant to Maugeron,
the Captain Morarque, captain of a company of footmen, and the Captain Coq
Ensign of Captain Cerf his company of foot, were there slain among the first
in the base town. The Emperor most joyful of the taking thereof, commanded
that with all diligence they should cause the Castle to be razed, but K. Henry
much more redoubled his former sorrow, being enforced notwithstanding to run to
the most expedient remedy, albeit there was before no other brute throughout
all France, then leauying of men of war, and all the ways covered over with
Soldiers, he sent again to hasten all his companies, and in as short time as
was possible to make ready his army to hinder them from doing any other
enterprise, thinking it sure that they would as they threatened to Dourlans
(where the Vidasme of Chartres was) a Castle of less strength then Hedin,
which the late King Francis had caused to be dressed up with earth, to serve
for a bulwark and counterfort to Hedin, at such time as it was enemy: therefore
on all sides posts flew about to solicit this preparation. As touching the
men of arms and French cauallerie, they were by and by ready and on foot, as
well in having been placed in garrisons, as for the commodity and leisure
which was given to the men at arms, to look for a little time into their
domestical affairs. The French fanterie was likewise very glad to be joined
together, the old Ensigns being complete in their garrisons, and places
ordained, with such good order as the new captains had set down to make
suddenly their leuies, and thorough the advertisement which they had given to
their Soldiers to be ready at the first warning, as for the Germans and
Lansknets, such as the K. had retained for his service, having always been
entertained and paid were already in the field, so in very few days and

who as well for abiding far of, as being of themselves heavy and massy, came
but by small iournies, especially to the end they might not be tired, when they
should arrive at the camp, but be fresh and prompt to fight suddenly if need
so required: therefore they arrived not before the end of that month: after
the taking of Hedin all the time while the K. army assembled, the imperials did
nothing else then raze it to the ground, and employ themselves to robberies, and
burning of Villages all along the river of Authia: and albeit that they had
summoned the Castle of Orlan, and spread a brute that they meant to besiege it,
they made no semblant thereof for all that, nor that they were willing to
attempt any new matter, until about the 13. of that month, when, having had
aduertisements how the Constable had caused 4. ensigns of the French fanterie,
and 2. companies of light horse to pass over the river of Some, they
determined with 4. regiments of their caualery to surprise, and defeat them so
readilye, that as they would have executed the enterprise before that those
which were about Amiens should be advertised thereof: it fortuned that the
Constable had addressed the same day another party to go visit them as far as
their own Camp, Paul Baptista having commission to pass the river with 50.
horse to attacke the skirmish, and draw the^ to fight, the D. of Neuers
remaining in ambuscade, with 3. companies of light horse, in a wood upon the
bank of the river of Authia, who finding himself at any time to be
ouermatched, had Sansac to rescue him, who was behind half a league of, with
5. other light companies, the Prince of Conde was a quarter of a league on the
right hand of him with 3. light companies: likewise the Marshall of S. Andre

being half way between al his companies and the river, accompanied with 4000.
horse, as well of companies as Rirebands, and 20. ensigns of Fanterie, half
French and half Lansknets, and 4. feelde pieces, but easing the French of the
pains to go seek them out, they approached near the Marshall S. Andre,
having left all their light Caualerie behind them, so as three hundred
horsecouriers rushed even upon the Constable without discovering any of the
ambuscades. Hereupon Sansac his light Cauallerie began the skirmish nearest to
the Marshals ambuscade, where the French were borne down, and rudelye put
back even to the hindermost man, so as they took two prisoners, who told
them that the Constable was not above a quarter of a league of with all his
forces, the which caused them to hasten to give the charge upon the companies
of the D. of Vendosme and of Sansac, who at the same instant was covered and
charged by an other thousand horse, and upon this medley the Marshall began to
march with a great trot right toward them, which quicklye stayed them, and by
and by they discovered the Prince of Conde in set battle galloping to join
upon them, whom as soon as they saw, they put themselves in such disarray, as
being recharged only with fifty helmets, they were put to flight: for the
Prince of Conde so roughly set upon them, as he and his company pursued them a
long League, where were slain of theirs between 7. and 8. hundred men, among
whom there was found of renown the Earl D'espinoy, and other great Lords of
the low Countries, seven as well Ensigns as Guidons gained, The D. of Asco^
prisonner.
near 500. prisonners in number, among whom the D. of Ascot was found. On the
French part for men of reputation, the son of Canaples, and of La Roche
Guion, and the Guidon of Sansac, remained there prisonners, with some other
soldiers, especially of the light cauallery, not any great number either taken
or slain.

This reencounter so happily executed, greatly quailed the courage of the
imperials, who since did no matter of importance, for incontinentlye after they
departed from Beauquesne, where they were encamped, so as having razed the
tower and the forte, they came by great iournyes as far as Ancre and
Miraumont, within 4. leagues of Peronne, French lands, where having put to the
fire, and lodged ten Ensigns of their brauest men within Bapaulme, thinking
that according to the common brute, the first fury of the French would be there
discharged, without making any longer stay, the body of their army retired
toward Arras, which was not as then very great or puissant, for many of them
especially of the borderers of Artois and Henaulte, retired to their own
houses, to gather together the best of their goods, and enclose it within
strong towns, or hide it in sure and secret places, knowing that the Kings
army was all complete, and was to put into the field within a few days,
the which in the end of August was assembled to gether near to Corbie; The
French army in the field.
and the first of September the Ensigns of France were displaied about the
little town with a mighty great number of men, the which the K. would needs
see upon a little mount, especially the Zuizers, now they set their battles
in such ordinance, as they carried the prise over many nations, a thing which
maruelously was agreeable and pleasing unto him: The Constable being general
of the army, and the first chief in the auantgarde, was accompanied with the
Princes and Dukes of Vendosme, Neuers, Anguien, Montpe^sier, and the Admiral:
each one of these Princes having a regiment of men at arms, which is of 200.
men at arms, and over which they commanded 49. ensigns of French sundry,
making up the number between 15. and 16000. men, of whom Chastillon Admiral of
France was general, the Earl Reingraue colonel of the Lanseknets, with
Reisberg had 4. regiments, which are 20. ensigns, making the number between
10. and 12000. men, four Ensigns of Scotts, and two of English, amounting
between twelve and fifteen hundred men. Sansac was the principal chief of
the light Cauallerie, near to two thousand horse, comprehending therein three
or four hundred English men, brave men, and well skilled in this occupation.
The nobles and rierbandes were complete very near three thousand horse,
whereof La Iaille was general, there were few of the particular companies of
harguebuziers on horseback, for that the King had a little before made an
ordinance thereupon, to every Captain of one hundred men at arms, to leauie
fifty harquebuziers on horseback, armed with corslets, murrions, vanbraces,
or sleeves of maile, with an handgunne or harquebuze, or a firelocke or cock,
within a case of well tanned leather, mounted upon good curtailes, and unto
every one of fifty, A new ordinance of harquebusiers mounted.
five and twenty in like equipage, conducted by a man at arms of the greatest
experience, especially to that end to be chosen out of their own company: all
which made well up the number of twelve or fifteen hundred. A thing well
invented and by good counsel, to assist a man at arms in any narrow or
vneaeasie place, and which gave great countenance and grace to the army, in
being the first before the companyes, together with the diversity of their
apparel. In this battle was king Henry near unto him, the Prince of
Ferrara, the Duke of Guise, the prince of La Roche-Suryon, and the marshall
Saint Andre, every one of these princes having a regiment of men at arms as
the rest. The great Escuyer de Boisi, and Canaples, with their bands of the
royal house, and the guardes as well French and Scots, as Suizers, and a
number of great Lords and Gentlemen following the King, as well in respect of
their fidelity, as to make known unto him their virtue and good will. Of all
sorts of artillery there was about one hundred great and small pieces, over
which Estre was great master and chief governor, a Gentleman very watchful
and of great spirit, for the first day of this voyage the army made no great
treat, incamping that night a league of Corbie in two little villages, upon a
current and small river, being very commodious for the same. The next morrow
it followed almost the tracke and way of the imperial army, to lodge at
Miraumont, it happened that in the way the Duke of Neuers slipped out of the
army with his regiment, taking the left hand toward the woods and forests,
over against Arras, where some scoutes were discovered, who saved themselves by
their swiftness within the thick of those forests, which being well looked
about, there was not one enemy found that made head, only a fort within a
little village, which a little after was forced by the harguebuziers, and found
worse provided than they imagined. The which caused him to turn to Miraumont,
to take his quarter. The second of September the D. of Guise with two regiments
of men at arms, between a thousand and twelve hundred horse as well of the
light cauallerie as of the nobles, and ten Ensigns of French fanterie departed
from the place, drawing thorough the rout of those woods toward Arras, to
discover and clear the most dangerous places, and subdue the forces of any
which should be retired thither, but he found not ought which was hard unto
him, having discovered as far as the suburbs of Arras. So returning for a
testimony of this voyage, fire was set on all the villages round about, with a
desolation and most lementable pity. Bapaulme represented.
Now from Miraumont there were but two good leagues to Bapaulme, a strong
place, barren more thorough the situation of nature, than any workmanship,
but much more odious and hurtful to the French bordering upon it, than ever
Terroane was to the Bourgonians, so as secretly the better to know the place,
and tempt the resolution of those that held it, the third of September the
Constable with the most part of the Princes, accompanied with five thousand
horse, and as many of the French fanterie, went to view this place as near as
he was able, whereof Huntsimond a knight was Governor, (much esteemed of among
the Bourgonians) furnished with ten or twelve Ensigns of Fantassins, and three
or four hundred horse, who at the first fight did not any ways show himself
sparing of powder and bullets, besides they within showed themselves very
slack and loath to come out to the skirmishe, but as far as the Bullets of
their artillery might play, they kept a loofe of, and performed their duty
bravely enough almost four hours, while the skirmish lasted. In these light
reencounters there were hurt the Captain Breul with a Harquebuze shot in the
thigh, and young Molimont Son to Molimont the Governor of Saint Dizier and of
Nogent, who afterward dyed at Peronne: during the skirmish the Admiral with a
small company went round about the place, and found it pregnable, the rampire
being of bad stuff, and the fastening wherewith it was made but a thin
crumpled sand, which is no good earth. But the greatest difficulty of all was
the remediles necessity of water, albeit that the Constable had caused a great
number of Pyoners to seek out Conduit heads and springs, but no veins of any
lasting could be found out, so the determination of the siege was broke of and
put over until another time: during this lingering there arrived at the Court
the Cardinal of Saint George, being a Legate from the Pope to treat of a
peace or truce between these two Princes: At their departure hence, all the
Villages, Abbaies and mansion places appertaining to the enemy, not so much as
sparing the windmilles near to the gates of Bapaulme, being partly consumed,
and the rest as yet of a flame and smoking, the ground and ways grew so durtie
and slipperie, by reason of a whole day and nights rain, that the Soldiers
and footmen could hardly get to their other lodging, named Morlincourt within
two small leagues of Peronne: and the wagons and baggage sustained no less,
whereof as well the garrison of Bapaulme, as the rest of the Pesantes about got
good booties, spoiling the most scattered and worst conuoyed sort of them: the
imperial army in the mean time coasted them within five or six leagues,
having the river as a bar and separation between them, albeit it was far
less then the French; for first even at the nose of the imperial Camp, the
French went and burned and set fire on the Villages next unto them, in respect
of the few alarmes which they gave unto the French, except it were sometimes
upon their vallets and fouragers, the which they rather supposed grew by the
spoiled and desperate Pesants, then by the men of war: and less hurt was
done to the victualers and provisions brought into their Camp, all victuals
being at a competent rate in the midst of an enemies Country, where they
found naught but Granges void of Corn and fourage, all sort of victuals
being already transported and withdrawn into the strong holds. The which
being come unto the Kings knowledge, The dessein of Charles 5. Emperor against
the French.
and sufficiently foreseeing that his enemy hoped and attended naught else then
to make him temporise about some town or other enterprise of small
consequence, to draw him on until the season of raynes, which begins soon
enough in the cold and occidentall Countries, to the end to ruin and weaken
him, as well in cutting of all his victuals, as by diseases and coldes,
afterward to give him battle upon his advantages, concluded with his
Council to give remedy thereto. The resolution then was to reduce his enemy
into two extremeties, the one of which he persuaded himself was impossible for
him to shun, and perhaps yield to them both: either to hold his forces close
together for the meeting of a battle, or to separate them for the defense of
so many of his places, uncertain which of them all should be first attempted
by the King, considering the secret of his dessein, and the variable turning of
his army, without any apparent resolution of the place whether it would turn
head, upon which persuading himself of the advantage of the first, and that
the Emperor durst not hazard a general combat, considering he had not so
many men as himself, and that they were more then half tired with the long
time that they had remained in the field, he thoroughly resolved to get by
force, slight, or any other mean: the first place he should attempt, and to
sack it, and ruin the whole country about in the eye of the Master, and so
to return in triumph, as having braued and caused him to refuse the day in his
own Country, and whereof he had vaunted himself to be the first challenger.
Charles on the other side measuring his advantage rather by the valor then
number of his people, supplying otherwise the long wearisomnes of these
travails of war, by discretion of well choosing his advantage, rather then
to accept of battle, no less assured himself to make vain the attempts of
the French in any place which they should go about to besiege; always
provided that his would have the patience to suffer the first heat of the
French, a little to euaporate as into smoke, knowing that Henry
notwithstanding the better to prevail therein, made account to sound Cambray,
as well for that the taking thereof would be an example to sundry other of
renown, as thinking to provoke the imperials rather to battle, then that
they would lose such a place, in which especially he knew his own credit not
to be so deeply rooted, but that for a small matter the inhabitants would
shake of the yoke which not long before he had imposed of them: join that the
town having been always Neuters, such occurrents might so happen, as he
might make it partaker with him, or at the least favorable, if they would
assist to the recovering of their ancient liberty, considering that in terming
it self Neuter, it was not lawful for him to have any greater authority over
it then the King, and the rather for that the magistrates and popular sort
began to feel themselves outraged by the usurpation which he had made over
them (having proceeded so far to his own advantage, as to build a citadell to
keep them in subjection) he feared least they would even make plain onuerture
to the King, being as then the stronger. In sum, if the Imperialles showed
themselves of good courage, the French caused no other brute to run, but of
the desire they had to battle, and how the King sought no other occasion then
such as the place and time yielded unto him: to wit, being there at hand in so
large and spacious a plain, to present battle, or to summon the Town
according to the accord of neutralitie, to make him onuerture, and give him
victual, or proclaim it as his enemy: and so not far from that place near
to Peronne, the French were encamped a two little leagues from Cambray. And the
next morrow by break of day the King caused his army to be set in order of
battle ready to fight, sending a herald of arms to summon the town of her
duty, signifying unto them that he was not come thither to oppress them, but
rather to restore and settle them in their ancient liberty, which he well
knew had been already corrupted by the Emperor, of which if they would be
revenged and leave that bondage, they could not have better means then by his
coming, that if the Emperor would quarrel for other advantages, he was
there in person both to declare, and fight with all his forces to the contrary:
if they did otherwise, they would be an occasion of much mischief to
themselves; first in losing the title and privilege of being called Neuters,
which is not affectionate to either the one or the others quarrels, by which
means they had only obtained the liberty to be able to traffic in both
their Countries. Moreover they should thereby exempt their Country round about
from the miseries of the war, otherwise they should remain for ever subject
to imposts, loanes, subsidies, and all other manner of exactions, and be
besides that in danger to be partaker of the sundry trauayles whereto a
particular Country is abandoned and accustomed to suffer for his Prince. In
sum they demanded twice four and twenty hours of the King to be advised
thereof, and to yield their answer, so the King caused his Camp to retire a
great league further back, being lodged at Creuaecaeur, of the appertenances
of the Queen, and it was proclaimed thoroughout the whole army, that upon a
great pain of corporal punishment no man should dare take ought within the
territorye of Cambray without paying for the same. During this delay the
Emperors party within Cambray certified him of this summons, as then lying at
Breuxelles, who to comfort and relieve them with hope and courage, set down
many things unto them: among the rest that they held of the Chamber of the
Empire, and that he was the Emperor to defend and protect them, not a King of
France who sought nothing but their ruin; so as having set before their eyes
the example of Metz, he promised the deputies that in case they should be
besieged, he would succor them by all means whatsoever. And from thence gave
order to the Prince of Piemont, who was gotten with his army toward
Valenciennes, that he should yield unto them as much succor as they would
demand, or well needful for them, ordaining thereto for chief and principal
Governors the Earls of Bossu and Brabanson. The time of delay being expired,
albeit the King knew well all these news, Their answer of Cambray to the King.
yet he sent again to summon them to know their resolution, but they sent
word that if it might so please his Majesty they were all content to remain
his humble neighbors and friends, no ways refusing to give him victuals, but
that as yet they were not masters over their own goods, for that the Emperor
spite of their teeth had put men and great garrisons into their town,
wherefore it was clean out of their liberty and power to be able to dispose
of any more. Upon this answer and mylde excuse the town was adjudged for
enemy, and the same day being the eight of September, the Constable with two
regiments of men at arms, Skirmishes before Cambray.
and 3. or 400. light horse and Rirebands, followed by the Admiral with ten
Ensigns of French fantery, went to pry and view round about, but in steed of
hearing the crowing of Poultrie before, now nothing was heard but Cannons,
harquebuze shot, and noise of all parts, especially from the cytadell, which
made the earth to tremble with the artillery shot, wherewith they played upon
the French soldiers, entering therewith as thick out of the Town as waspes
use out of the hole of a tree after him that stirs them: but so maintained
and the skirmishes so gallantly handled, that they continued six whole days
together, in one of which there was killed De Brese captain of one of the
French guardes, and before the Cytadell Coruet was slain, Captain of one of
the companies of the French footmen. Of the Bourgonians there was of reputation
taken and brought prisonners the Earl of Pondeuaux of the French County, De
Trelon of the Duchy of Luxembourg, and other. In the meanetime Bourdillon sent
unto the King by Neuuy Ensign of his company, two Cornets of Bourgonians,
broken and defeated at La Haiette, near to Maubert Fontaine, the Governor of
Cimetz, one of their chief remaining there prisonner, the Bastard of Auanes
another of their chief leaders by his good speed and well flying, saving
himself. Now to return before Cambray, it was perfectly viewed and by the advice of such as had marked round about from the one end to the other, join
the report of the spies and such as likewise had viewed it within, Description
of the town of cambray.
found to be as much subject to the Cannon and mine as any place might be: it
is a great town, situate half in a bottom, and half hanging, where there
is not any show of Bulwarks, Rampires, or fortifications according to the new
fashion. On the side of France and the East, it is in a champion and arable
Country, This town of Cambray was ever coueted of the K. of France, but never
able to be reduced to the Flower delice, until Francis D. of Brabant, Aniou,
and Son of France, and only brother to the King, had by siege taken the
same, and so annexed by his prowes at this day to the Crown of France.

The Citadell of Cambray.


discovered well eight hundredth or a thousand paces in breadth, not so plain
notwithstanding but there is a little descent still unto the Town having
certain small bottomes and barricades between both, but I call it plain for
that it is not ouershadowed with trees, nor thorns, nor other places hindering
the prospect; on the west side where it is most low and the suburbs lie, there
are gardens and groves of willowes, with some medowe and marshe. Southwards
there is a little hanging plain toward the Town, and a little further there
are little hills and vallyes, on the North side is a little Mountain which
takes part of the coigns of the citadell mounted over the highest part of
the whole town, where there was wont to be an Abbey or Cathedral Church,
almost square, notwithstanding one of the coigns stretches more toward that
little mountain, then any part of the rest, resembling a coin in form of a
spur, serving for a defense to the flankers with a platform. As touching the
situation and foundation of the Citadell, one would judge it at the first
appearance white earth, as marse, if it were stone within, I would think it
tender and easy to be hewn, as you see ascler whereof some houses are
builded, but it is rather a white chalk then a hard stone, so as some hold
that it was rather builded to hold the newter town in subjection, then to
make an impregnable fortress for being joined to the Town as it is, it were
needful to fortefie it, the one to succor the other, by reason that the town
being taken would endemnifie the Citadell, which also being forced would be the
cause of the loss of the Town: but the Emperor partly in consideration that
this great town would hardly be fortified, or at the least not of a great and
long time, and partly for that he would not oppress the inhabitants with
sudden surcharges, first builded this little citadell, to set one foot
within, and to be meet with the mutynies and rebellions of the citizens, to the
end that by little and little he might make himself master of the whole.
Therefore they held out thorough the hope of a great number of men sent unto
them, furnished with victuals, munitions and all other necessaries: besides the
Imperial army which fortified it self near unto them, to cut of victuals,
and annoy as much as might be the French: and lastly the raines which ever
begin at that season in those low Countries, so great presumptions had they to
recover the siege, for besides the diverse alarms which they gave unto them,
with continual and hot skirmishes, they sent out of the camp part of the
field pieces, and caused it to be given out, that there were far greater
coming from Amiens, Corbie, S. Quentin, and Castelet, a great number of
Gabions being already prepared, and sleddes made ready to draw them to those
places where the approches should be made, so far as the Marshals of the
Camp went to mark and view the situation, the better to order their
quarters: notwithstanding the council had no such intention, but to the end
that still holding them in this iolitye and opinion, they might break and
consume the Imperials by little and little, who for that cause had more
enlarged and separated themselves: wherefore without any longer delay, all the
fortes round about being thrown down and ruined, even to the very Churches,
the Towers and Steeples being undermined and battered, and fire put to all the
Villages, Granges, and cotages, even to the very suburbs and gates of the
town, Feeble places ought not so much as to offer to hold out against an army
bringing canon.
the French dislodged marching straight to the castle of Cambresy. In the way
there were two fortes taken and ruined, obstinate upon very small reason,
whereby they well felt the effect of the conquerers choler. The first endured
six and thirty Cannon shot, and a great and wide breach before it would
yield, where the Captain Pierre-longue was slain, and twelve French
Soldiers slain and hurt, notwithstanding there was not one living soul found
within, having conveyed themselves under ground, and hidden in some caves and
mines, therefore they stopped close all the ventes which they were able to
find. The other was not so strong as the first, for that it was but a skuruie
poulier of earth hanging houelwise to the half of a great tower, with dry
ditches, where they within standing very obstinately to their defense,
notwithstanding any summons, made aboade two shot of the lesser sort, after
which having answered that they would not yield without sight of the Canon,
they made a sign to yield, but it was too late, for the Soldiers not as yet
cold of their first fury, never stayed so long as the once discharging of a
Canon, but rushed in as mad men to beat down the gates, where afterward
it was great pity to behold the slaughter which was there made, for there
was not so much as one man taken to mercy: the battle lay encamped round
about the Castle of Cambresy, without suffering any body to go in saving one
Ensign, the which was lodged there to repel other, if they should go about
to make any stir: for the inhabitants were in great doubt what should befall
them. His Majesty and the most part of the Princes and great Lords was
lodged in a sumptuous house of pleasure near hand, which appertained to the
Bishop of Cambray, where in stead of being revenged of the burning of his
Castle of Foulembray, which was done by Du Reux a kinseman of the B. he not
only straitely forbad they should not set it on fire, but that nothing should
be carried thence or spoiled. A little above the river the Constable remained
with the Vantgarde. Now all these boutes and devises were but to mark the
enemies countenance, for the French being advertised that they stirred in no
sort of the world to follow them, without any alarm, or semblance to come
upon them, having soiourned a whole day in that place, descended down to
Quesnoy, approaching within two leagues of Valenciennes, where the imperial army
was imparqued within a forte which they had there addressed. The next morning

Imperials forte.
the rest of the army advanced forward to seek out the imperials, and to
present them battle. Their forte was about a Culuerin shot distant from
Valenciennes, upon the same River of Lescau which passes along by Cambray,
compassed in form of a square, environed with trenches and diches of a Pikes
length, and between 10. or 12. foot hollow, seated half on the hanging of
the hill toward Valenciennes, and half in the bottom along the River, having
on the side of the French a little hillock which went sloping even to the
forte: besides that it was very proper to place there the artillery, and shot
level into the fort, with great discommodities, therefore even as the army
marched their ordinary pace in battle, the auante couriers and light horse
rushing before to attack the skirmish, found a great number of their Cauallerie
already in order of battle upon the little hillock ready for the Combat. And
hard by they took one of the Country on Horseback in habit of a Merchant,
some judging him to be a spy, who certified them that the auantgarde of the
Imperialls had passed the river to come to fight with them, so as being brought
unto the Constable, and from him sent unto the K. he was the cause of the
advancing forward of the army, and with as much speed as might be ordering of
the battles in their places. In the meanetime the skirmish grew warm,
thorough the sallye of a number of the imperial fantassins, which greatly
annoyed the lost children, without any stirring of their men at arms at all,
who kept themselves a little above them, saving such as sometimes went out of
their ranckes to break a Lance where they saw their opportunity against the
French, light horse encamped front to front. During these skirmishes the
Imperial army ranged it self, part into one only square battle within the
forte, and the rest was divided by the flankers, especially the Harquebuze
shot, in the same manner as they use at the assault of a Town. The artillery
was planted one part upon mounts of earth, which drew above the hillock that I
said was one the side of the French, and the rest was disposed as well to
scour the defenses, as all along the trenches. The ordering of the French army
was in this sort.

In the Vantgarde were two square battles, on the right hand whereof were 24.

among which was the Constable, the D. of Mompensier, and the Admiral with
their Regimentes of Demilances, which was six hundred men at arms to each
one, and a little below a party of the nobles, and somewhat higher all their
Harquebusiers on horseback: that on the left hand was of 19. Ensigns of
Lansknets, there was in this wing the Princes, and the D. of Vendosme, of
Neuers, of Anguien, with the like number of men at arms as the right, and a
party of the nobles a little more backward, with their men of ordinances, then
the Constables were to conuer a little hill which was on their left hand, and
the Harquebuziers more forward, near unto a little Village which was burned,
to keep that the enemy should not so much as creep on all four by that way,
without being espied. In the battle were two other square battaillons, that
on the right side was of the old Ensigns, in number 25. In this wing was the
King with his whole household and gardes, and the Marshall of S. Andre with his
Regiment of men at arms, on the left side were of the Swizers and Grisons 30.
Ensigns, the most part armed with corselettes, vambrases, cases, and the best
furnished that of long time has come into France. In this wing were the Prince
of Ferrara, the D. of Guise, the Prince of La Roche sur-yon with their
Regiments of demilances, each one 600. men at arms, the Captains Momus and
Eurard, two of the most ancient and best experimented, had the leading of the
lost children. Now for so much as the field was very fit, plain and champion
near hand a great league, the whole was so equally handled, that it hung with
one same weight and measure, especially the spaces which remained between the
battailons of the footmen, and the ranks of the men at arms were so well
compassed, that it seemed impossible to the French, (without some very great
desastere) that any harm at all should happen unto them: for to begin with the
battailons of the footmen. The order whereof was so well established, as that
the author seemed to take the invention thereof from the practice of the
Romans, that if the first ranks were at any time put back, they should
retire into the second, and the first and second into the third, so might they
three times resemble and fight unto the very last, An invention of the French

each battaillon having his flankers of pikes and harquebusiers which were able
to make head in all places, and succor as well the horsemen, as the core of
their battailons: The whole was so well armed and covered, that when the Sun
had shone, you would have judged all those troops to have been heaps of
Silver. As for the horsemen each regiment extended far, so as there were
always 200. men at arms in a front, and their suite of Archers at their back
all along, in such sort as if a man at arms had been overthrown, the second
had straight stepped into his place, so as they had al means to fight even to
the very last. The Ensigns of the men at arms were in the midst, and the
Guidons in the midst of the rank of the Archers: as touching the light
cauallery, it was divided into four squadrons, that of the vantecourriers
which was at the skirmish was led by Paul, Baptista and Sansac kept the other

that of the vantgarde was upon the front of the right wing, and that of the
battle upon the hanging of a little hillock, on the left hand of the Zuizers
and Grisons, who had already made an end of their ceremonies, with intention to
fight and dye even to the very last man, before they would make one false
point. Now besides that the assistance of so many men was able enough to put
courage into the most faint hearted, The K. presence gives great encouragement
to the Soldiers.
the presence of their King set them a gog much more, who being accompanied
with a great train of Princes and other great Lords, went notwithstanding to
visit and encourage such as had any need, with so sweet and amiable
language, stirred up with such vehemence and affection, that each one seemed
most willing to dye for his service. Now his whole army being thus ranged in
order of battle, and the skirmish growing more and more eager on the one
part and the other, the Imperial caualery stood still, and seemed ever ready
to al events upon the little hillock. And so were they attending their coming
more then three long hours, a brute of their coming flying up and down so
long among the French, that night at the last approached. In the end the
Constable foreseeing that they cunninglye delayed until the night grew dark,
either to surprise or put them out of order, advised the light Cauallerye to
join together to seek out the height of the Imperial Cauallerie. The charge
of the French Cauallerie.
The which was readilye executed, but with such a cheerfulness and
dexteritye, that they beat them back, and liuelye drove them in less then
nothing, even to the very boorde of their Trenches, causing them almost all to
fall huddle upon one another tail into them; where of the French side of
reputation was slain Ienlis a gentleman of the Duchy of Bourgondie, having
been brought up of a Page in the Kings house: it was then that their
artillery, as well that of the flankers, as that which was upon the mountes of
earth, began to play their prise, the which killed some, and hurt more of the
French then were found to have been hurt by any handstrokes. Among the rest
there was slain the Captain Steph an Italian Gentleman, Lieutenant of the
companyes of light horse to the Captain Senetaire, and De Ferriere Lieutenant
of the companies of light horse to Giury of the house of Estanges. This
bickering endured for all that more then a long hour, where on the French
part there was slain of horse and foot about one hundred men, so as when the
retraite was sounded the Sun was already set, and the night closed in. Now
had the Council long debated, whether they should assail them even within
their own forte or no, considering the good hap of their first charge. But
the better part were of opinion that they were rather to content themselves,
in that they had already done them so great shame in their own Country, as not
only to have executed a part of their Princes will, but to have presented
unto them the battle, Consultation whether the enemies were to be assailed
within their own forte or no.
which they still threatened to do from the beginning, and now coldely enough
and with a slender excuse had refused. Their reasons not to attempt any further
were; first that the French Soldiers were grown wearye and faynte, as well
with marching as with the weight of their armor, contrariwise the enemies were
fresh and reposed, not having for certain days together run the field.
That the Country was theirs, and their proper enheritance, which would
encourage them to fight the more courageously. Joint that considering the
situation of the place, they could not be assailed but to their great
advantage, as the battle of Poitiers and La Bicoique might well serve for
example. Likewise that the French were not only to fight at the first forte,
from which though it were lost, the Imperials might easily retire into the
town, ready to begin a fresh; especially when they should be able to do both
the one and the other, the French should be sure to be the first which should
take all the pain and hazard of the enterprise, a good part of them left
behind in gage, if not all, as well for that it is not the property or nature
of a Zuizer or Lansknet, to assail a town or fortress, as in that they are
not otherwise so affectionate or inclined as subjects are to their Prince,
whereby if it should so happen that the K. should be in an enemies Country,
unfurnished of the better part of his forces, Retraite of the French.
it were to be feared that many mischeefes would ensue, according to the
uncertain occurrence of feats of arms. And therefore it was concluded that it
was far better to retire with honor, the^ to hazard ought under the hope of an
uncertain and aduenterous good luck, so they placed again the battailons of
fantery in single ordinance: afterward they returned to the place where their
baggage was lost, the Constable with all the Demilances and Cauallerie of the
vantgarde, was the last which departed to see if they would play the wagges in
the end, and set upon them behind, which they never once offered; so as by the
light of the fires which burned the Farms and villages for three leagues round
about, the French in the end found their first lodging, where at night it was
proposed in council by some Lords, that there was very great means and
occasion offered to return again to seek out the enemy, to fight with them,
and enforce them within their own forte, for that by the report of some
prisonners which were newlye come thither, it was not of so great defense as it
was adjudged: assuring that on the South side in the bottom by the river it
was very weak, and that there their trench was not perfited nor five foot
high, that there would be means enough to pitch and order the battles, and
to make it be assailed by the lost children, whilste that the artillerye
planted upon the hillockes of the flancker should shoot level in. The which
would either make the^ to come out in disorder and so quit the place, or suffer
themselves to become a deadly mark to so many Cannon shot, as would shoure
down upon them. But albeit that this advice was at the first allowed for
sound, yet after that the old and experienced Captains, had delivered their
mind, and spoke as they thought good, they found that the latter opinion was
the more sure: following which, after one days abode to refresh themselves,
the army retired toward the castle of Cambresy, where likewise the French
remained another day, without setting fire either on that fair house, or the
town, only all the victuals within were taken out, for that the enemies
should not be relieved therewith. Afterward they retired as far as
Fonsomme, two small leagues from S. Quentin: and there was the army dissolved
about the 20. of September, Retrait and departure of the French army.
for the Zuizers well paid and contented, had leave to retire into their own
Country, and part of the Garrisons was put all along the frontiers, and the
rest sent home to the government of their Captains: as much was done with all
the Nobles and rirebands. The other part of the Demilances and light
Cauallerie, The Marshall. S. Andre sent with part of the army to recover the
County of S. Poul.
with the old Ensigns and the Almanes, were retired and assembled at Auchy to
Chasteau below Hedin, and led very shortly after by the Marshal S. Andre
toward the Countye of S. Pol to destroy it utterly, and to waste and ruin for
ever, as well the Baylifwicke of Hedin, as the Countye of Ponthieu, and all the
rest of the country of Arthois, which was put in execution by him in the very
view of his enemies, without any resistance, remaining still superior, with
such fury and desolation, that there was not so much as the poor shepherds
cottages or houels spared, but the whole country set on fire, and ashes round
about Air, S. Omer, Lislars and Perne, the castle whereof was by force taken,
and about 50. spanish soldiers slain and hewn in pieces. Thus was the voyage
of the French army, more remarquable for fires, ruynes, sackings, and all
other sort of desolations, by the example: and in revenge of the Hannuyers and
Bourgonians over France, then for any trick of notable virtue, saving a brave
skirmish which the Vidasme of Chartres made before Lissars, with fifteen
Ensigns of French Fanterie, and almost two thousand horse, against nineteen
Ensigns of the Spanish Fanterie which lay encamped about the little town, for
that the inhabitants had shut the gates upon them, fearing to be sacked by
them as their neighbors had been. The skirmish lasted almost a whole day,
each party being obstinate to the gaining of the victory, which after a long
hazard and uncertain combat, remained to the French, very few of them being
either dead or hurt, but many more of the Spaniards, whereof in like sort
diverse were brought away prisonners. After all this coil the French returned
to Anchy, and about Hedin, Count Reingraue.
where the Almanes were put in garrison, the bayliwick whereof was given by the
King to the Count Reingraue. In sum toward the end of the month of October,
some companies as well of the French Fanterie, as light cauallerie being cast,
the rest were divided and put into garrisons, to pass over the winter which
drew on.

In the mean time the Emperor proceeded on to pursue a marriage between his
son the K. of Spain, and the infant Mary new Q. of England, with such
earnestnes, as he forgot nothing which might serve to the consummation thereof;
A marriage treated between the K. of Spain, and the infant Mary new Q. of

seeing him self almost out of all hope to have succor elsewhere, or
recovering of any money at nearer hand: which many of that Realm sought to
hinder foreseeing an immortal war with the French, which was prepared for
them by this means; remembering well the losses and damage which they had
already sustained, in having vpholden the war against this nation, from
whence the Country of England reaped great commodities. Notwithstanding so
much auayled the persuasions of the Emperor, with the instigation of the two
Queens Mary and Elenor, and above all the inductions of Cardinal Pole cousin
to the Q. that she being clean ravished with this new love, and with the
ambition to see her self wife to the Son of an Emperor, the better to
assure her estate against the reformed and other malcontents, in spite of the advice and liking of the greatest of her Realm, keeping her sister Elizabeth
likewise a prisonner, consented to this marriage. Afterward with as much
speed as was possible she affianced by Proctor (which was the Earl of
Aiguemont) Philip K. of Spain hoping shortly after to perfect and consumate
the overplus. The K. knowing that all these things tended to no other end, but
cheefely to endamage and annoy him, made a great mass of money, calling such
to his aid and succor, as he knew were most obedient and faithful unto him,
and as he thought best able to aid and do him service.

Pope July to the end to pacify these great troubles of Christendom, Cardinal
Pole sent to treat a peace between the K. and the Emperor.
had sent the Cardinal of England to mediate a peace between the King and the
Emperor, for you must understand that upon the pursuit of the wars of these
two Princes, Pope July seeing all Europe as it were much moved with the fear
of mischeefes which was likely to ensue to every Country, by reason of the
particular quarrels of these two Monarcks, with a secret remorse and gnawing of
conscience, for himself had been the Author, had sent the Cardinal of
England his Legate to the King and the Emperor, to advise, and by all means
to unite, and cause them to condescend to a good peace: in which he employed
himself so virtuously, that laying aside all ambition, or fear of hatred, or
other considerations, he never ceased to lay before them the infinite miseries
wherewith the poor Christian people were afflicted, together with the
vncertaintye and miserable estate, whereunto the Catholic Church by their
dissentions was reduced. And albeit that many accounted him to favor the
Emperor more then the King, yet he seemed to have so well managed their
hearts, that the hope of a peace was already common thorough out France, and
quarters neighboring about: yea so great that the poor borderers of the one
and other Lord, persuading themselves thereof, so assured themselves by little
and little, that they reedified and began to reinhabite their cottages and
small tenementes, as yet besmoaked with the fire, wherewith they had been
burned to ashes, so far as every man promised unto himself a happy repose,
if it would please God to mollify the hearts of these two great Princes. But
even as all the tokens of Moses and Aaron hardened the more the obstinate
courage of Pharaoh, to the end afterward to make the great wonders of the Lord
to appear: so this great God, not yet satisfied and content with so small a
punishment for our enormous sins, would not permit unto them the
understanding to receive a good and assured peace, for the ease and repose of
all Christendom: wherefore the Legate after many trottings to and fro of each
side, returned very sorrowful unto the Pope, leaving in the hearts of these two
Princes, this so inueterate an enmity, whereof the clamors could not so soon
mortify the effects.

of Lorraine, Anne de Montmorency Constable, and the Duchess of Guyse daughter

In the mean space and about the first of the spring there arose a certain
brute of a war at hand between these Princes, and much furniture and weapons
were dispersed, whereby they might be polished and made ready to the service,
afterward to be mustered, as soon as the fame was spread throughout France,
how the Emperor had prepared a great leauye of men of war, and all other
sorts of provisions, toward the Countries of Liege and Ardennes, with intent
to besiege the Town of Mesieres, having established Mariembourg and Auanes, as
store places and markets to his army, so as Bourdillon who then was at the
Court, was presently sent back to fortify and strengthen this little Town,
with whatsoever should be necessary to attend their coming. On the other side
the K. foreseeing the Empeperours determination and intent, made all means to
assemble his forces, to the end to meet him and prevent him of this small
enterprise, having sent sufficient enough of succor into Piemont and Italye,
thereby to pursue and continue such good beginning, as fortune in that part
had presented unto him. Besides he dispatched Captains and commissioners to
bring him men of war as well out of Germany as from those Cantons of Zuizers
as were his confederates. This was about the end and issue of the Spring, when
as the Sun raising him self high, to send among us his great heates, burned
and consumed the fruits of the earth, with so strange a drouthe, that together
with the long travail of the war the poor people expected naught else to the
aggravating of their miseryes, then a great and mortal famine for the heap of
all their pouertyes, which notwithstanding came not to pass, and so certain
days passed over, that the King seeing all his forces ready, albeit that his
enemy made semblaunce of naught else, then busied in the consummation of his
sons marriage, determined to advance forward, and by the same place that he
was threatened to be assailed, The K. army assembled in diverse pleces.
to assaye him, and enter within his Countries. To this end he assembled his
forces and divided them into three, to wit, in Pickardy about Saint Quintin,
under the Prince of La Roche Sur-yon, in the Valley of Laon, toward Crecy
under the Constable, and at Mesieres under the Duke of Niuernois. Under the
Prince of La Roche Sur-yon, might be nine or ten thousand footmen, the most
part Picardes, and the rest of the old Ensigns, with three hundred men at
arms, and five or six hundred horse, and Harquebuziers on horseback. Under
the Constable were five and twentye Ensigns of French fanterie new and old,
two Regiments of Germans of the Count Reingraue and Reifberg, and five and
twenty Ensigns of Zuizers, with four hundred men at arms, and near
eighteen hundred or two thousand as well light horse as Harquebuziers on
horseback, whereof the Duke D' Aumale was General, a little before come out of
prison, and almost as many nobles in the Rireband, under La Iaille their
General, there were also some companies of English and Scottish Cauallerye. The
D. of Niuernois had twentye old Ensigns of French Fanterie, drawn from the
garrisons of Metz, Verdun, Thoul, d'Anuille, Yuoy, and Montmedy, (comprehending
therein four English and Scottish Ensigns) in place of which other new were
put in, two Regiments of the Count Rokendolphe, and of the Baron of Frontenay,
three hundred men at arms, near eight hundred light horse and Harquebuziers
on horseback, whereof the Prince of Conde was general, and two hundred
pistoliers Germans. The army then being thus divided in three diverse places,

to the end to hold the enemy in doubt of what they had deliberated to
execute, and on which side they would surprise him, the French entered by three
several places into his Country. The Prince of La Roche Sur-yon having passed
the river of Sum, gave within Artois, with a most cruel and furious a
beginning, burning and ruining all the Country along as he passed. The
Constable having taken his way toward Mauber Fontaine, the 23. of June,
fained as though he would address himself toward Auanes; the common brute
being that he went to besiege it: but as soon as the Ensigns of France were
discovered by those of the plain Country, they abandoned Villages, boroughs,
Castles, and other places, constrained for their surety to retire within the
Ardennes, with the better part of their moueables and Cattle, esteeming
themselves (considering the places inaccessible, thorough the difficulty of
being able to bring artillerye) exempt and out of all perilles, amidst the
thickest of those woods, by reason whereof they were able the more easilye to
ruin the Village and Castle of Cimetz, the Castles of Trelon, Glaion, Commins,
and other little fortes near hand. Besides their retreat served them to very
small purpose for the Duke of Neuers being determined to tame and bring under
his obedience, this nation smallye frequented through the difficulty of the
Ardennes, dislodging from Mesieres, encamped his army at the entrance of the
Ardennes, in a Valley rough and unpleasant enough, at the end of which there is
a little Village called Vieil-meseuil, a name very aptlye given, The army of
the D. of Neuers and his exploites.
for that it was rather composed of old ruynes of manors, then of houses of
habitation. And that night he dispatched De Marets a Gentleman of Niuernois;
one of the most ancient and experienced men at arms of his company, together
with his Trumpetter to summon the Castle of Orcimond, distant six great
leagues thence, to whom the governor called Colas Lois, Lieutenant to Bayson a
Gentleman of Liege, who a little before nothing mistrusting their coming, was
departed thence, answered that he would never yield except he saw the Cannon,
not for that he esteemed the Castle tenable, but by reason of the height of
the Rock upon which it was situate, which was almost inaccessible on two
sides, notwithstanding they planted the artillery in a little plain toward
the wood for the battery, the place appertained to Barlemont General of the
Emperors finances. This answer being heard, the Prince determined to go
somewhat nearer to view them, and to lodge his army one league from the
Castle, The difficulty of the Ardennes.
if the difficulty of the places had not stayed him half way, in some places
so hard and stonye, that it was impossible for either men or horse to stand
sure, and besides so strait, that they were enforced to march single by one
and one, and in some so steep and painful, that their breath failed them in
climing, and else where the descents were so steep, that they were feign to
creep down pace by pace, and to graspe and hold fast, except their head
should first tumble down, to their assured death: so as the horses served to
very small use for drawing of the artillery, the force of men's arms being
there much more needful, for the better and more sure managing and conducting
thereof: true it is that throughout there was so good order kept, as the
enemies could hardly give any impediment thereunto, for that all the ways were
furnished with Harquebuziers every ten pace, for the suretye of the whole
train: this night being the 29. of June, the Prince encamped in another Valley
called the Valley of Suranda, near unto a rock, where was wont to be the
forte of Linchant, The fort of Linchant ruined. Stream of Semois.
at this day for the most part ruined, under which and all along this valley
runs a river, or rather a swifte stream called Semois, which runs
toward Bouillon, and falls into La Meuse, underneath Chasteau Regnaut, from
this place he sent Iamets with a Regiment of French Fanterie, and artillerye
to batter the Castle of Orcimont, which as soon as it was saluted with two
Cannon shot, they within being altogether dismayed, without concluding in any
other sort of yielding, never set themselves to any defense, but the Chief
secretly shut up all the keys, and by a secret posterne which opened into this
valley between the rocks, saved himself with 12. of his most favored
Soldiers, leaving the rest well astonished and doubtful of the event, The
Castle of Orcimont summoned, besieged battered, and yielded up by the flight of
the Defendants.
who notwithstanding shortly after yielded themselves to the mercy of the
Prince, whose prisonners they were: when the Captains of the rest of the fortes
all along these ways, had received advertisement that for certain the Prince
had trained his artillerye, which before they would never have believed,
without further endeavoring how to annoy his passage, or to stop and hinder
his ways with great Logges and trees field down, as they are wont, clean
abandoning their fortes, munitions, and all places whether they were wont to
retire themselves, they fled of all hands, so as being arrived at Louettela
grande, after their departure from the Valley of Suranda, they found a little
forte called Villarcy, of earth and timber, all void, the which 25. or thirty
Couriers which had been there within had quited, under the charge of the
Captain La Loss borne at Mesieres, which ever since his tender age had been
brought up in the service of Lumes, and after his death continually followed
the parties of his master. Abandoning thus this forte, he set fire of all the
houses and surplus of the rest of the village, whereby the Vastadors ordained
thereunto by the D. were eased of much pains, A Church likewise which the
Ardennois had caused to be fortified called Fort de Iadines, was found open
and abandoned, which in like sort was all razed, and beaten down saving a
great square tower, whose coins and fastnings in the building were broken and
scattered about, by the Cannon shot, which the Prince in passing by caused to
be given. In sum all the villages, fair enough considering the barrenes of
the Country, were burned and destroyed. And for that the fort of Iadines was
the most hurtful of all the rest to the French, bordering upon them, the
governors of Mesieres oftentimes assaied to take it, but ever in vain until
this blow. About the last day of June, the Prince encamped at the village of
Valsimont in the bottom of a vallie, Valsimont the 4 lodging of the D. of

where a swift stream runs called Vouye, which comes from the mountains
and falls into Meuse near at hand: thence he sent the Harrowlde of
Angoulesme with his trumpet or to sommon the Castle of Beaurin, in the confines
of Ardennes, and upon the limits of the country of Liege, which likewise
appertained to Barlemont, the Emperors favorite. Report being made unto him,
how the soldiers had brought great booties out of the woods, with a number of
women and young maidens, knowing that in this fury of war, they could hardly
help and protect them selves, he made them all to be shut up, with
commandment upon pain of life not to do them any force or violence: but to
bring them all into a certain lodging, where having used great liberality
toward the soldiers, he made them be safely kept until the next morrow that
the Camp was departed. And then upon the report of the Harrowlde of
Angonlesme, how they of Beaurin meant not to yield except they saw the Cannon,
they marched thitherwards. Hereupon such as were appointed to take the view
were received by them with the bullets of many harquebuses a croc, The Castle
of Beaurin summoned.
and muskets, willing to show that they were provided as well of courrage as
other necessaries, so attending until four Cannons were presented unto them,
ready to give fire. But finding what danger they were in, and being advertised
that if they did not yield they should all pass at the swords point, and such
as escaped by the hangmans hand, after having a while parlied and demanded to
escape life and goods saved, they were in the end reduced to this extreamitie,
that they should yield themselves to the good mercy and pleasure of the
Prince: who caused the chief of them to be kept prisoners, and sent away the
rest of the petty companions, every man a white stick in his hand. John
Colichart borne at Bains in Heinault Captain of this Castle, was led away
prisonner with 40. of his best soldiers. Beaurin Castle yielded.
Among which was the Captain of the forte of Iadines, named Le Grand Gerard
and La Loss, of whom I spoke before Captain of Vilargy, who was not put at
all to any ransom, but sent back shortly after to Mesieres, there to be
punished as a traitor. The D. of Neuers lodged within the Castle a company of
foot of the old ensigns, and 50. harquebusieres on horseback. At their
departure from this siege, each man began to rejoice, that he should out of
this grievous and painful desert, and enter into Liege a country so pleasant
and delectable: taking their descent by the ports of Giuets the most renowned
upon, the river of Meuse. But before I pass any further, I will not forget how
as well to render the Navigations of this river which runs all along the
countries of Liege, and Brabant easy and open unto them, Cap. Salsede
commissioner general for victuals, conquered all the Castles along the river.
as to enforce the rest of the small Castles and little forts, along, there
was left there the Capitane Salsede, general commissioner for all the victuals
and munitions, with six companies of French fanterie, and two Cannons. Who
after that by force he had taken the Castle of Sumet, appertaining to the D. of
Ascot, he clean abandoned that of Hurge, which appertained to Barlemont.

As the Prince of La Roche Sur-yon burned all Artois and the borders about,
without any resistance at all made to his little army, so the Constable having
caused the brute to be given out that his determination was to besiege
Auannes, so far as that the light cauallerie had more then once skirmished
before it as though they meant to view it, albeit it was well strengthened with
a Garrison and other munitions, being notwithstanding advertised how
Mariembourge had but a bare ordinary Garrison, and that small, the most
covertly that was possible, caused the Marshall S. Andre to depart with the
Suisers, and some companies of French foot, assisted with two or three
thousand horse, and the most part of the artillery, who made so good speed,
having all that night cleared the ways and Lanes, which the enemies had
stopped, and hedged in. As the 23. of June, at ten of the clock in the
morning, he was come with all his troops before Mariembourg. Whereat they
within being altogether astonished, and much more the night after when they
understood that the succors which they attended were driven back, and no
possibility for them to enter, yet to show themselves as men not dismayed,
they played infinitely with the Cannon, which for all that would not serve the
turn, any whit at all to stay these new come guests from beginning their
approches and trenches. So as the next morrow the Constable being arrived with
the rest of the army, and seeing the good beginning of this siege, to bring it
to a better end, he caused the approches to be continued with such diligence,
as the third day of the siege, having made five or six Voleys of artillery
only to break the defenses, a parley was requested by the besiedged. In sum
many of their Articles being refused, they condescended in the end to yield up
the place to the K. lives and goods saved, all saving armor, munition and
artillery, and De Rinsart remained prisoner with the Captains and principals
of the City. Which being well stored with all munition of an inestimable
price, was thus yielded up the 28. of June, 1554. Whereat the K. much
rejoicing, shortly after departed toward Laon, Mariembourg taken by the French.
there to find again his army the last day of the month. The which in sign of
joy at his ariuall was pitched in order of battle, and the whole artillery
discharged, yielding a marvelous report and echo between the woods and the
rocks of the Ardennes, giving notice to the rest of the imperial towns of
the yielding up of this. Which in respect it was the rampart of the whole
country was well enough fortified. It had been in former times a little village
where all assemblies for any great hunting still met, in which Q. Marie took
singular pleasure. But for that she found the seat thereof very proper and
delectable, she fell a building there sparing nothing which was any ways
requisite to the beauty or fortification thereof, which she would in far
better sort have perfited, had not the K. taken it who not only was studious
to finish what as yet was imperfect, but better to fortify and rampire it, then
ever it was before: commanding them of Mariembourg, to name it from thence
forwards Henriembourg.

Rocroy a small village between Maubert-fontaine and Mariembourg fortified for
the safety of the passage.
Now to the end to make the way more easy, and the better to be of discovery,
as far as the little town of Maubert-fontaine which was the next, they
caused a little village called Rocroy to be fortified, within which they
lodged the Capitane La Land, with his ensign of 300. men on foot, the
Capitane Breuil of Bretaigne with three companies of French still remaining in
Mariembourge. Shortly after Gonor was sent thither from Disnan: having already
been governor of Metz, who received the King, order to remain Leiutennant
general at Mariembourg, at the hands of the D. of Neuers. Who at his departure
from Ardennes, a little after the taking of the Castle of Beaurin, had sent the
Harrowlde of Angoulesme, with his trompetor, to summon the Castle, and town of
Disnan, and to know whether the inhabitants determined to continue in
newtralitie such as was accorded in the country of Liege, or if they would
hold out, for and in the name of whom, of the Emperor or the Bishop of Liege.
But in stead of yielding an honest answer, or speaking like a soldier, far
forgetting themselves, Their answer of Disnan to the D. Harro^lde and
trumpeter.
they answered them that if they had in their hands the K. and the D. of Neuers
hearts and livers, they would soon make a frycasse of them for their breakfast,
pelting there with so many Harquebuse shot at them, that they were compelled to
return with all speed and deliver their report. The D. of Neuers being come
down with his army, as far as the ports of Giuets the first day of July,
found that the Castle of Agimont not yet yielded, standing on this side the
Meuse a quarter of a league from the other Giuets, albeit it had been already
summoned. Notwithstanding the same day he made a number of his light
Cauallerie to pass the water, with certain companies of foot, to enuiron the
Castle, attending the K. army which marched from Mariembourg of purpose to
join with them. Now as the vantgarde of the K. army arrived, the footmen made
semblance as though they would scale it, and give the assault, The K. army.
which in the end turned to good earnest, for the soldiers entered so far and
furiously in sport that they within could no longer sustain their assault. In
such sort as they were compelled to acquit and abandon the defenses, and to
give them entrance: so as being entered with fury, they put all to the sword,
that offered to make any resistance, which was for all that no great number, nor
men of any mark. And there was taken prisonner the Captain of the Castle
called Eurard de la March, own son to the Earl of Rochefort, Father to him
who then lived, Lord of the place, and the most part of the rest of the
soldiers, were sent away the morrow after. The whole army remained on this
side at Giuets, encamped for the most part between the borough and the Castle,
in a long and spacious plane: and notwithstanding that this great river made a
separation between the two armies, yet did not their kinsfolks, friends,
neighbors, and companions fail continually to cross over to visit and feast
one another. The King himself being moved with the good report which he had
heard of the D. army passed over in person to see it in battle on Wensday the
sixth of that month, and found it in so good order, and equipage, that he grew
thereat much contented. Now there remained but a little forte called Casteau
Thierry which appertained to the Baylife of Namur, or else all round about was
subjected to the K. obedience. Therefore there was sent thither the same day a
regiment of the French footmen, with artillery, and some companies of horse:
but those which kept it understanding what entertainment they had had at
Agimont, never tarrying their coming quitte the place in good time; So was the
Castle found empty, and abandonned, but furnished with most fair moueables as
was possible, and great quantity of all sorts of grain. These two armies
soiourned at the two Giuets six whole days together, and the seventh
dislodged* the Kings feet kept on the way on this side the Meuse, and the D.
of Neuers for the difficulty of the ways, was feign to encampe that night in
a vallie two leagues from Dinan, above which there was a Castle called Valuin,
which was found empty, and he lodged in the base court. The next morrow the
two armies encamped about the Town and Castle of Disnan and Bouines. The
artillery being planted upon the height of an hollow thorough which the high
way passed which went to the plane above, battered Bouines so furiously until
three of the clock at afternone, Bouines furiously battered and taken by
assault.
that a breach being made at a portail, and within a Tower, the assault was
therewith all given, and carried away with small resistance, being only
defended by them of the Town it self, with whom it fared full ill for their
labor: For upon the first fury there was made a sore slaughter, some thinking
to save themselves leaped into the water: and yet for all that they could not
escape death, the most part of them being slain with Harquebuze shot, whilst
that they dipped to the bottom of the water like Duckes. The rest albeit that
they had crossed the river, and so taken prisonners by the French, were
afterward hanged, and strangled: for having so rashly resisted and held out
against the K. power. True it is that in the recompense of the fair wars
which the Spaniards made unto the French, at the taking of Teroenne, the K.
pardoned and saved a number of their lives, Forts punished for holding against
the K. power.
which were retired into the great Tower which stood above the Town.
Afterward of his great and accustomed humanity, he caused the women maidens,
and young children to be all saved, and gave unto them for their better safe
conduct, a Harrowlde and a trumpetor. Now the very same morning as the D. of
Neuers hard by the Castle of Disnan, would needs him self with Iamets go
near to take the view, Iamets horse next adjoining to his own person was
slain with a Harquebuze a croc: himself being warned there by, how such
cheefes of an army ought not so venterously to expose themselves to such
peril: for that day notwithstanding the battery was not begun, for that the
artillery came not time enough; but only all the rest of the day, many
Cannons playde, to begin to break down the defenses, A chief of an army
ought not to be to ventrous.
and certain Gabions, as well upon the portaile, as at a little round Tower
above the Town, which greatly annoyed them: so as all that night was employed
in making with all diligence the aproches and trenches, but not without great
danger for the numerable shot, of artillery and Harquebuses a croc which
played from the Castle, without any murder for all that, or loss of any
person other then miserable pyoners. The next morning this Castle was saluted
with thertie great pieces of artillery, fiftene on the D. side, and as many on
the Kings on the other side of the river which gave all along the hollow, and
even within the very Castle: so as a wall of Brick which was the highest was
perced thorough by day, they battered likewise in flancke, a great round Tower,
at the corner of a core of lodging which looked toward the North. On the
Dukes side was battered a great round Tower, seated at the end of the same
lodging, cleaving to the bulwark of the portall: and this thundering continued
without ceasing day and night until Tuesday, about three of the clock in the
afternone, that these two Towers were raised and battered down, and a breach
made at the end above this lodging about ten pace long, notwithstanding it
was very uneasy to clyme, for that the Cannon could not fasten upon the foot
of the wall, being amain Rock. Ioynte, that they must be feign to creep a
Pikes length, and the ascent was very slipperie, and unsure under the soldiers
feet, by reason of the earth and cement which continually fell upon it. But
for all this it was resolved at the instant to give the assault. And the
Admiral led such companies of French as were ordained thereto unto the foot
of the breach, praying and exhorting them with many fair, and gracious
remonstrances, to remember the immortal renown, which the French had achieued
for feats of arms thorough out the whole world: and of their duty where with
they stood bound for the faith and assurance which the K. reposed in them,
this speech being ended, some Capitanes followed with their valianttest
soldiers, marched on, and with an assured gate advanced forward to clime up:
the Capitane Maugeron being one of the first, so as they within esteeming him
to be followed hard, and that the French would of them selves stoop, and
creep in, set fire of a train which they had prepared, which being quenched
if the soldiers pursuing their enterprise had but assaied to enter the enemies
could never have held out longer, the walls having been already so shaken and
broken with the artillery, that it was impossible for them any longer to
endure. But if some of the French performed their part well, there were other
which be haued themselves so coldly, that they have left a very bad opinion of
them. The Capitane Saragose being ensign colonel went to it very bravely and
was sore hurt, so did the Capitanes Gourdes, La Mole and Le Forte, whose
ensign bearer called Le Basque was there slain, and flong down from top to
the bottom, and his ensign thrice taken up, they still being cast down which
took it up, so as at last it remained in the hands of a Gascon soldier named
Fougasset. The Admiral Colonel of all the French fanterie, seeing his soldiers
thus to wax cool, excusing themselves by the narrownes, and evil access to
the breach, to give them heart began a little more severely to exhort them,
showing unto them, that if in the K. presence they would make no better proof
of their hardines the good reputation which they had heretofore gotten, would
turn them to a far greater reproach, and a perpetual infamy. The which he
had no sooner finished, but the further to set them in a heat he began first
himself, and after him the more to encourage them, Monpesat (albeit he had no
charge at all in their bands) seized upon one of their ensigns, and bravely
before them all carried it up to the top, where he covered himself behind
certain quarters and ruins of the wall which was fallen down; calling them
and making sign with the ensign that they should follow him. It was
impossible for all that, to make them take any further courage unto them:
whereby some Captains before well esteemed of were very ill thought of ever
after, of whom some were disgraded, cast from their charge, declared villanes
and unable to bear arms in the face of the whole army, which witnessed their
fault. As the night came on, so was the retreat sounded. That day they of the
Town of Disnan, yielded themselves at the mercy of the K. into the hands of
the D. of Neuers: who forgetting their foolish and rash words received them,
and assured them of their lives, and that their Town should not be burned: to
that end the Capitaines Duras, and Boisse, were sent with their companies of
French fanterie: but albeit that these companies were lodged there for their
assurance and safety, yet could they not warrant them from the sack: for the
Almanes of the new leauie, imagining that these companies had been gotten in
only to have the sack among them, ran thither upon a huddle, and broke open
the gates with hatches, crows, and great beams: the rest which had not the
patience to tarry, crept up, and scalled the walls, leaping in, in a number
of places, where they made a marvelous piece of work: and not content with
this, understanding how they had caused all the women and young children to
retire with certain Citizens into the great Church, they gathered together in
troops before it. And after that they had by violence beaten down the gates,
and porches of the temple: notwithstanding any resistance made to them by the
French which were within, they ravished and trained out the men, women,
maidens, and young children: so as for that cause was raised a crueell medly
between them and the French which would have put them out. The which endured
all that night and until the next morrow in the morning until the King sent
expressly to appease this mutiny. And afterward it was proclaimed
thoroughout the whole army, that every man upon pain of death should deliver
up the women of Disnan: which he caused to be nourished until their departure
with his own provision, albeit that the soldiers themselves were in great
necessity. After that the French were retired from the assault, the artillery
began on fresh to batter the Castle, to make the breach greater and more easy,
continuing the battery all that night: while that they sought other means to
have it by the fallings of the wall right against the breach making it more
easy to clime. Notwithstanding the 13. of July about seven of the clock in
the morning, they offered to parlie, and being admitted thereunto, there came
out first de Floyon governor of the Castle, and Hamon Captain of the Almanes,
who were conducted to the D. of Neuers tent: to whom having proposed Articles,
and it being resolutely denied unto them to carry thence any weapon,
artillery, or ensign, they agreed that they should depart with sword and
dagger, and some other trifling baggage. But Julian the Capitane of the
Spanniards, to keep a kind of authority which that nation makes it self
much to be marked for in feats of arms, insisted with great persuasions that
he and his people might depart with their weapons: the which for all that the
Constable would by no means grant. Now while that they were reasoning about
this and sundry other things, Bourdillon, and de Rabaudanges were secretly sent
to know, and conclude with the Spanniards whether they were willing to come
forth with like condition as the rest: to which they most willingly consented
demanding nothing but liberty. Wherefore the capitulation being brought back
to the Constable, signed, and accorded, was showed to Julian, who after the
Spanish fashion making great exclamation said that he one of the chief and
principal of all did not consent nor approve it: and required with great
importunacie that he might be conveyed back again to the Castle, which he
undertook to keep only with his Spanish companies: the which of favor was
granted unto him, with protestation, that if he were taken by force, he should
hope for nothing but to be the first hanged at the gate. Whereupon by leisure
his choler was moderated: having occasion to think rather of the danger
wherein he stood, then to shut himself up with his soldiers, which desired
nothing but coming forth one after an other: the K. being still present, who
took great pity of them, the most part of them being so worn and tired, as
they looked like frighted bodies, and true Anatomies, thorough the pains and
necessities which they had endured: the whole amounting to above 800. of all
sorts, and there dyed one another about eight score, or two hundred. Tauannes
his company was appointed to conduct the rest in safety the way of Namur, and
this Capitane Julian was kept prisoner, not only for the answer which he had
made, but for an other more especial occasion. This Castle was reputed amongst
one of the strongest and fairest houses of the B. of Liege, with B. Eurarde, of
the house of La March, uncle to Iamets then living, had caused to be
reedified, upon the old ruins, but far more excellent and strong then ever
it was before: likewise sundry other as Hue, Franchemont, Stoquehan, Bouillon,
and Floranges. It is situate upon an huge Rock, which may be about and of
circumference near four hundred paces, issuing from the side of a mountain
of great scope, upon the river of Meuse in form ouall: inaccessible two ways,
on the Town side and on the rivers: very uneasy likewise on the side where
the breach was made, upon the two fronts are two bulwarks, in half circles, or
as they commonly say in form of horse-shooes, the one vieweth and defends all the plain of the mountain, serving for a platform, the other above the Town
and river is almost in the same sort, saving that it was not so high, and the
upper part made of Brick, no whit at all rampired. Within the Castle is a
square court of about forty pace in Diamiter and widthe, environed with three
great core of houses, of a maruailous fair building and workmanship: propped
up underneath with great colomes, the most part guilt, specled all with white
and graye spots, of which was likewise all the foundations made, and the upper
part of Brick. The under story was all environed with fair and long galeries
and walks: and above were many great romes proper and well fitted with
Chambers and a Chapel taking light toward the Town: without toward the
North stood these two round Towers, which the Cannon ruined even to the very
foundations: and below a courtaine or false braye flankered with Torions which
was almost broken down and battered. At the root of this great Rock all
along the river stood the town, well builded and adorned with houses,
situated most properly for the bringing of al kind of merchandise, especially
copper, brass, and all sort of russet colors: on the other side of the river
about 200. pace off stands the town of Bouines which is not much less then
Disnan, of the County of Namur, and it is found that in ancient time the two
towns made warlike wars together. Disnan holding the party of La March which
was for France, and Bouines of Burgondie. Disnan being a neuter town lost her
neutrality, for at the apetite of their B. uncle to the Emperor to subject
themselves to one particular, who by violence (said some) did vsurp the
Bishoppricke of Liege, from the Abbot of Beaulieu to whom his said uncle had
resigned it. Whereupon the humanity and sweetness of this Prince was much to be
marked, who by no means would have the town of Disnan burned as Bouines was,
but had regard unto the subjection which the Castle so much commanding over,
always had the town in: and therefore in the most fair and strongest part
thereof, it was by his own fault beaten down and battered, for ever after to
be an example, that neuter lands, and especially of the Church ought not to be
partial or cleave to any one more then another.

Whilst that these two armies stayed about Bouines and Disna^, the other of the
Prince de La Rochesurion burning all the country of Artois was sundry days
skirmished withal by a number of Flemmings which sided and followed him
continually to interrupt his purpose: whereof the Prince being advertised, and
of their courses which they still kept between Arras and Bapaume, came so
fitly upon the^ that having wrapped them in upon the way, he charged the^ in such
sort that there lay above 200. and of their principal chefetaines there were
brought away prisoners, De Fama governor of the Citadel of Cambray and his
Leiutenant, Varluset Capitane of the light horse: so as if it had not been for
a good horse upon which De Hausimont governor of Bapaume was mounted, he was in
as great danger to have borne them company. Two Cornets of their cauallery were
there defeated and taken which the Prince sent unto the K. whereby he might be
the more assured of the advantage which he had over his enemies. The 15. day of
the month many French merchants which by river had brought victuals to the
camp, having sold the^, and going back again to Mesieres with their botes
laden with booties, and certain soldiers, and the Capitanes Garragosse,
Gourdes, and La Mole hurt in the former assaults, were reencountred by the
Bourguignons not far from Giuets, and constraining them to come abord, killed
part and part, they carried away prisoners, among whom were these three
captains, to whom they made very fair war, and gracious entertainme^t,
sending the^ away upon their faith. English and Scotts taken at the ports of
Giuets by the Bourguignons.
At their departure thence understanding how at Giuets were certain English and
Scottish companies pertaining to the French, they suddenly went to surprise
the^, and constrained them to retire into a house tenable enough, but brought
away fowerscore and six of their horses.

The Emperor who as the^ lay at Bruxelles near enough, being advertised of all this, and how the common bruit of the camp went, that at their departure from
Disnan they me^t to besiege Namur, caused as many soldiers to be lodged there
as he esteemed necessary, knowing it otherwise but meanly fortefied for any
artificial fortification, and that as a great number of men were needful for
the assailing of so great towns, so as great and careful diligence for their
defense to be requisite. Seeing in like sort all the commons of the plain
country so moved and out of heart as all was abandoned he sent his nephew the
D. of Sauoy for his Leiutenant general, with as many soldiers as he was
recover, readily to emparke himself in the town side in a place called
Giuelou, between the two rivers of Meuse, and Sambre, where he got together and
assembled his army with extreme diligence: having sent for succors out of al
places. As soon as the Prince was fortefied in this place, he scattered his
Cauallerie upon the way where he thought the victuals would pass for the
French, as well to weaken the^ and give them occasion to retire, as to learn
and know their determination causing a bruit to be sown, reported by spies and
prisonners, that if they adventured to march further, or to pass the river of
Sambre to enter into Henault, he would present himself a head to give the^
battle. The Emperors army under the prince of Piemont.
But the K. as not being so far entered into his enemies country to return
without passing further, having likewise left the way of Namur, stayed to pass
over the river of Sambre, and to burn the country of Henault, whereby he
might make proof of the imperial forces: from whence such being returned as
went to view the places and way which the army must pass thorough, having sent
back Bourdillon with his company to Mesieres to cause certain Bourgingnons to
retire, which burned certain villages about, the K. raised his army from this
place the 16. of July to continue his determination: knowing notwithstanding
the difficulty to recover victuals, and how the enemy had gotten al within
their strong towns, and broken down al mils, he thought good to advertise the
whole companies, to make provision of as much victuals as was possible, even so
far as to lade their horses with provision: the D. of Neuers remaining upon
the Meuse side, as well to make the surplus of provisions to be distributed, as
to tarry the raysure of the Castle of Disnan, and of all the rest of the small
fortes about, whence he departed the 18. day of that month, and went to find
the King at Storne a small village, where the Lord of the place, as he was
ready to go to dinner, was surprised by the light horse. The next morning, at
their dislodging, that was set on fire, and all the villages round about. Now
as the army lying between these two rivers there was no means honorably to
retire, but by the issue of an happy combat, so already and resolute for the
show, marched in battle straight to this river. Their couriers notwithstanding
having given as far as the brinkes of La Sambre, found not so much as one
sole man to make them resistance, and passed forwards freely so as the whole
cauallerie followed after, then the ^^nterie and men at arms without the loss
of any one vallet, were it not by some other accident. Likewise the imperials
not finding themselves strong enough as then, contained themselves close within
their fort, and insteede of going out to seek them, they were shut in and
fortefied with good trenches the best that was possible. Notwithstanding that
night there were certain troops of their cauallerie discovered, which
presently drew back into the woods, having perceived a number of French
companies, which were ready to accost them. So the poor popular people abused
with the hope, which they imagined of the imperial army, were surprised
within their houses, with a mighty number of cattle, and other moueables, not
without great pity: all the plain country being set on fire and extremely
ruined, especially one little Town called Forces, within the county of
Assebais. This night they encamped on this side the river in a Copice, where
the whole army kept close and well united, perceiving the imperials to be but
one league and a half of. The twenty day of the month the French army
began to make her entry so furiously within the countries of Hanault, that
there was nothing but fire, cries, flightes, and all things pitiful to
hear, but much more to see, without so much as one burrow daring to make
resistance. All the people flying away from the reencounter of this horrible
fury, which continued until euentide, that they encamped in the village of
Iumets, very famous for the two new forts which were there: from one of which a
number of imperials having been advanced thither to cut off the victuals from
the army, had already given the slip at the bruit of the vauntcouriers. These
Castles were in the strongest places ruined and raised. In this place the K.
did an act worthy of a most Christian Prince: for having been told him by a
guidon of the D. of Neuers company how a poor woman his hostess was delivered
of a fair son, himself would needs be godfather, carried it unto the Font,
and their caused the Cardinal of Lorraine to Baptize it by the name of Henry,
bestowing certain presents of him: besides that he made it be written over the
house door, to the end it might not be destroyed nor ruined with the rest. Thus
is the house where the K. Christened the child. This night the comte
Roquendolphe with his pistoliers, his regiment of Almanes, the D. of Bouillons
company, An act of a most christian K.
and two small field pieces, undertook to go surprise the little Town of
Niuelle, the first town of Brabant: notwithstanding finding it better furnished
with men of war then he supposed he returned without doing ought else then
burning the suburbs and villages abouts: from whence he brought away great
booties. At their dislodging thence the army drew straight to Bains one of the
principal towns of Hennault, leaving for all the ways behind it nothing but
flames of fire, smoke and all kind of calamity: whom the D. of Sauoy still
followed with the imperial army from lodging to lodging: given at their tail
as many alarums as he was able, to annoy and weaken the^, being of himself
grieved enough to hear and see the plaints of the miserable common people so
destroyed and ruined: to whom he could give no other comfort, but say that they
still fled before him, and he followed still after to be revenged of the^. An
occasion that the same day they encamped about Bains where they lightened far
greater fires then the first, The imperial army follows the French from
place to place.
for that there were spoiled and consumed to ashes the most fair Castles and
gentlemen's houses, which were possible to be builded. Among the rest the most
sumtuous house of Marimont was set on fire, curiously builded for the singular
pleasure of Q. Mary, furnished with as many singularities as was possible to be
imagined. An other excellent fair Castle, called Tragny was burned and the
greatest part ruined, Marimont a house of pleasure to Q. Mar^e burned.
where were found sundry moueables and rich vestements as well of men as women.
The 22. of July the Town of Bains being summoned, and no ways willing to
yield, was most furiously presented with the Cannon, and in another manner of
sort then when D'Alegre lost his life there. Which having endured out six
volleyes of the Cannon, yielded themselves to the Kings mercy, who for all
that commanded it to be destroyed and burned, not forgetting his Castle of
Foulembray and other Towns of Picardie, which Q. Marie had before caused to be
burned and entirely ruined, at such time as he was in Germany. They did as
much to a sumtuous Castle which she had newly caused to be built, replenished
with all exquisite things as of sundry varieties of Marble, Tables, plate
pictures, and embost statues, colors of all sorts, whereof notwithstanding in
small space was made great wast and destruction. De Blosse who was governor
thereof was brought away prisonner, with the chiefest of mark which were found
both there and within the town: the K. still using all meekenes toward the
women, young maidens and little children, which he made be conducted and put in
safty, by a Harrowld, and a trumpetor. Afterward the same morning de Giry
Leiutena^t of the D. of Neuers company, was sent with 4. other companies of men
at arms, to keep scoute to those, which set fire on the Castle of Reux, which
the late master thereof had caused to be reedified, and better masonned then
ever it was, when it was first builded, being vowted from the bottom to the
top: from thence they were at Bais sur Bais a village: afterward at a little
town of Bauets, very anucient first builded by the Trojans, (as they of the
country tell) which passed beyond the forest of Mormant, calling it after the
name of their Prince Bauo. At this time smally inhabited, but to ruin it the
more fire was put in many places. The imperial army still followed the^ very
near, being better strengthened as well by the succors of Almanes which the D.
of Brunswich brought, of 2000. Reistres, which they call in France Pistoliers,
as for that all the Emperors Garrisons, which he had distributed among the
towns which he had left behind were retired thither. The which caused the
French to march in better order, and closer then before: as always ready to
fight, from one place to another, for doubt of the enemy, being very vigilant,
subtle and courageous, where he could spy any advantage to assail the^:
whereat the Constable well aduising, to support the charges, and enterprises,
which the enemy might give upon their skirts, ordinarily remained there with
the vauward, and dislodged ever last. Thus the alarums redoubled at their
departure thence, having as it were couped themselves in between six great
Towns of their enemies to wit Mons in Haynault, Auanes, Landrecy, Lequesnoy,
Valenciennes, and Cambray, and the imperial army which was at their heels,
and had assailed them as by a despair had not been the good conduct of their
chefes the imperials having aduentred so far as in clear day to force their
whatch, after they had surprised one of the sentinels of Tauannes his company:
notwithstanding not daring to adventure further, as soon as they were
perceived, they were driven in as far as Lequesnoy. Now this night their
light cauallery skirmished long, and with luck enough, which was a cause to
make the^ forbear, and take some rest the surplus of that night. Having then
from Villie encamped at Souleine, and from thence at the burrowes and Castle of
Gommigny which they burned, they marched forward the 24. of the month, when as
their enemies as it were desperate, in seeing their country burned, destroyed
and sacked by the^, without any doubt of being followed, or fear of being
famished, proposed to give the^ a charge, taking vantage of the raynie and
misty weather: knowing likewise that they had two reasonable bad rivers, to
pass which were swelled that night where they hoped to delay the^ and put the^
in such dioder, as they would have them at devotion having all their own
garrisons joined together. Therefore they divided into two troops about 4000.
of the best horse they had, laying part of the^ in ambush within the woods upon
the way, and part of them within certain villages at hand according as they
might most co^modiously sustain one another, the D. of Sauoy remaining behind
with other 4000 horse and some footmen, having belaid the field with 4. or 5.
hundred couriers to entise forth their light horse: whereby they being first
discovered by the D. D' Aumale, The imperials enterprises upon the French army
it was thought fit to send to the Marshall S. Andre, who remained at their
tail with two regiments of men at arms to know if it were best to charge
the^: who sent back word that he was not of that opinion, fearing they had a
greter company. Wherefore Paul Baptista, and the capitane Lanque were sent to
view them more near: who made report each one of his side that they had
descried two other troops of 2000. horse a piece which anon after as soon as
the wether grew clearer, discovered themselves at full, and so near as they
attacked skirmish with the light cauallery of the French hard by the camp,
without setting, or giving in earnest upon any of the other ranks of cauallery,
and men at arms: which made the^ hedlong enough, and in their view retired and
passed this last river: afterward they returned without carrying the honor to
have had any advantage at all over them. The regiment of the Duke of Neuers was
sent another way, where certain of their scoutes were defeated, which brought
great quantity of baggage, but part thereof was again reskewed. Afterward
they encamped that night in a village, which the year before had been burned
called Viellie. The same day a trumpetour which the Duke of Neuers had sent to
the camp, called La Capelle, to understand what was become of a man at arms
of his company, returned almost al naked, and stripped by some soldiers of the
enemies, smally experie^ced in feats of war. But at the instant he was sent
back again in the same estate, with a trumpetor, who was charged by the K. to
tell the D. of Sauoy, the Emperors Leiutenant general, that if hereafter they
used any more the like fashions, and all the priueledges and liberties of war
should be thus abolished, he would do the like at his next siege. Which being
understood by this gentle Prince, to show how sore he was displeased thereat, he
caused diligent search to be made thoroughout his whole camp, for those as had
committed so base and lewd an act, to have the^ punished in example: so as
having recovered the trumpetors clothes and horse with recompense for such
other things as had been taken from him, he caused him to be safely co^ueied
back by one of his own. Now for that some of the imperials had caused the
brute to run, how that the French did fly before the^, and that if they
would but stay 24. hours, the Prince should give the^ battle, they answered,
that they saw no cause to be so brag, nor so lightly to vsurp such glory,
occasion of co^bat having already been often enough presented unto them if
they themselves had listed. Notwithstanding if the Prince had so great desire
thereto as he made show for, he assured them on the K. behalf, that he would
stay full 24. hours and no more, or if he would come find him out near
Cambray, he did assure him that would tarry for him 8. days together, where
nothing should be refused him. But whilst they sought out the most commodious
places to lodge their battellons and men at arms, the imperials in the end
retired to their first lodgings near to Bauets. An occasion that at their
departure thence the French with one march got as far as Craeuecaeur near
Cambray, where the enemies had determined to fortefie and repair the Castle,
having already begun to make certain trenches and conduits to taste the water,
purposing there to lay their foundations which the same day being the 26. of
July, their pioners began to raise: where the first wound of the miserable
Cambresius was renewed, who had already set up and builded some little cottages,
only to keep themselves dry: imagining that a long time there would not so
great misfortune befall them, having according to their ability again sowed
part of their fields, to have wherewith all to nourish, and keep themselves
from famine: so as the richer sort, and glad to that they were with their best
moueables retired within the strong towns, were not exempt out of al these
losses and adversities: for when the tennant is poor and afflicted, the Lord
fares never a whit of ought the better. Now whilst that in the plain country
they made wast of Corn already ripe, and ready to be reaped, many brave salies
and skirmishes daily fell out between them of Cambray and the French: the
Citadel still troubling and darkning the air with shot of Ca^non, which lighted
only among the worst sort, without slaying of any person of renown: which they
did only by all means possible, seeking to hinder the loss and ruin of their
fruits, being notwithstanding often enough repelled and driven into their own
gates, so as these bickerings continued for the space of 8. days, whilst that
the French lay there encamped. The imperial army in the mean time was pitched
and fortefied in a place called Arcon between Cambray, Le Quesnoy, and
Valeciennes upon the little river of Montet, which comes toward the Castle
of Cambresy, and a little lower falls into Leascau, still continuing their
courses to cut off the ways: which the Prince De La Roche Sur-yon well
perceiving came thither, incorporating his army with the K. which he
succored with great quantity of victuals, whereof they stood in great want
and necessity.

In this time was the marriage concluded between Philip of Austria, and Mary
of England, though with much more honor to the English, then to the Spanniards:
having taken from him by the contract of marriage, Marriage of Philip of
Austria and Mary Q. of England.
many commodities which ordinarily are proper and incident unto a husband, yea
so far as to deny unto him the courtesy of England which carries. That a
Queen enheritrice to England, coming to be married to a Prince stranger,
Courtesy of England.
and afterward dying, the husband should enjoy such goods as appertained unto
her during his life, though no heirs at al were issued by marriage: wherein
likewise may be very well noted the power of the estates and Parliament of
England, over the disposition whether living or testamentarie of their Prince.
This marriage notwithstanding, though very honorable to their nation, yet
stuck sore in the minds of many Lords and other of the country as well for
the displeasure which they took in that they were to be commanded by a
stranger, as for the change of Religion and policy, already as it were grown
old and settled in the hearts of many: so as with a full resolution to hinder
the same, and to set up Jane of Suffolk as Queen, they rose in arms under
Henry of Suffolk, Thomas Wyat and sundry other as well in Cornewale as the
North country. Wyat undertook to bring his men straight to London chief
City of the Realm, hoping to draw the Londoners unto him under a pretext of
the countries liberty, and hinderance of the alliance with a stranger. The Q.
on the other side having levied a great number of men caused the Duke to fly
to Warwick, from whence seeking to escape into France, he was apprehended
and brought to London by the Earl of Huntington, who marched against Wyat,
gathering men out of the Duchy of Norfolk, the Duke whereof being taken
prisonner by Wyat, in no case would be persuaded to combat with this party,
but afterward being released, he revealed unto the Q. all the enterprise of
Wyat and his partners: with whom stood likewise suspected and kept as
prisonner, Elizabeth daughter to Henry and Anne Boulen. Wyat notwithstanding
being arrived at London was much astonished. But the Queen though with small
force, having publicly to all men rendered the cause, which moved her to take
the Spanniard to her husband, and how that the country should there by receive
much more good, then by her alone, or any other English Prince: besides; how
she would loose nothing of her own, nor any ways diminish the liberty of her
subjects, encouraged them so far as Wyat clean out of hope of entering the
City, and seeking to retire into Kent, being pursued was defeated by the
Earl of Penbrooke: afterward brought to London, Jane of Suffolk and her
husband with sundry other beheadded at London.
within short space, both the D. of Suffolk and himself, had their heads cut
off, being not long after followed by Jane of Suffolk and her husband, for not
having refused, the unfortunate Crown which was offered unto them. Thus began
the marriage of Marie, with the effusion of her subjects blood, as almost all
the rest of her Reign consumed in division: and full of murder and
punishments of the most notable personages of her Realm. These troubles being
appeased the Prince of Spain arrived about the end of July in the I Will of Wight:
from whence being honorably conducted by my L. Paget and other, entering
afterward further in to England, followed by the D. of Alua, Earls of
Padille, Rigomes, and Aiguemont, the Admiral of Castile, and Marquis of
Languillare, the marriage was solemnised the 23. of July at Winchester, where
Mass being finished, the Emperors deputies declared how in favor of that
marriage, his Majesty did give unto his son the realm of Naples, Sicilie,
and Jerusalem, the Dutchies of Milan, Burgondie, Brabant, the Earledomes of
Aspur, Flanders, and Tiroll.

Henry in this mean while, continuing still ready and upon his guard caused in
the great plain between Craeuecaeur and Cambray a general muster to be made of
al his men at arms and French Cauellerie, about the month of July whilst that
his footmen and cariadges had gained the advantage, and passed the River, for
some companies of light horse being sent forth for watch and scoutes, returned
word back how that they had discovered near hand to a four or five hundred
horse, and a great number of foot, making show as though the Emperors Camp
marched, keeping their way as though they went directlye to Cambray, whereof
they were no sooner advertised, then likewise ready, with resolution rather to
fight it out in the field, then to permit or give them leave to fortify so
near unto them, especially with the help and succor of so great a Town,
whereby as much mischief might happen unto them as did unto the Protestants of
Germany before Ingolstat, whereupon the D. D' Aumale remounted suddenly on
horseback with the light Cauallerie, the better to be assured of the truth, and
found how the imperial army was indeed removed with full determination to come
and encampe near Cambray, but that the Emperor knowing how they were not
departed thence, fearing to be enforced to fight to his great disadvantage,
lodged in another place near unto the first, called Neuuille, which he caused
soddenly to be renforced with trenches on that side, which was not flancked to
the river.

This night at sundry times were fent out some companies of French Cauallerye,
and of the Admirals men at arms to keep them in continual alarmes within
their forte, until the break of day next morning, that the Constable with the
most part of the men at arms of his vantguarde, and two Regimentes of French
Fanterie went near to view and see if there were any means to force them
within their forte, or to entice and give them occasion to come forth. But he
found that very hard, for that this place was two ways enclosed with the
river, and on the other sides well fortified and trenched in, assuring himself
by the discourse of natural reason, and examples past, that for the smalnes of
resolution which would be had therein, he could not carry away more honor and
profit, then he had done at other times, and in his young years at La Bicoque
a simple Country house, of less strength then the place where the Marquess of
Gnast defeated all the fury of the French, Zuizers, and other partakers of the
Flower de luce. True it is that in his return he espied some old Towers
where sundry of the enemies were lodged on this side their Camp, as well to
keep scoute, as to endamage the fouragers: whereupon it was concluded that the
Cannon should be brought thither the same day to the battrie; by this means
the rather to provoke the Emperor to come forth to guarde and defend them.
But the imperialls clean acquitted them retiring within their fort.
Notwithstanding to give all occasions which might be, as also doubting the
descent of the English into the country of Boulonnois, the marriage having
been already solemnized between the K. of Spain, and their Queen, Henry
determined to make his army unto those parts. where according as the
commodity presented it self, he might besiege on of his enemies holds, to
the end that if he would put himself into the field and strive to rescue it,
the Emperor might be thereby constrained to fight. Having then soiourned
certain days at Creueceur near to Cambray, the second of August he
departed, and the same day went to encampe at Ondrecourt nere the Castelet,
whereof the Emperor being advertised, raised his army from Neuuille, and
taking his way toward Arras, pitched at Marteau, The day after the French were
at Mornencourt, two leagues from Peronne, and the next morrow passed before
Bapalme saluted with infinite shot of Cannon. Notwithstanding the army made no
long aboade there through the discommodity which they found in not being able
to recover water: but only the light horse skirmished sometime before that
place whilst that the whole army descended to encampe that night all along the
little River underneath Mirammont; whence they departed the next day, keeping
their way all along the borders of the County of Artois, where they saw a
wonderful waste which the Prince of Roche Sur-yon his army had made sundry
fair Castles and Villages as yet smoking, the Corn and fruits of the earth
clean destroyed and abandoned, which are the miseries and calamities that the
wars and dissentions between Princes bring to poor people. That night being
the 5. of August, they encamped Paz in Artois; where some cauallerie of the
Garrison of Arras keeping along the woods and covered cuntry, undertook to
free about upon the hinder part, but being encountered with their English and
Scottish Cauallery, were defeated, and the most part of their Soldiers
dismounted, and other brought away prisonners, whereby the loss of Giuettes
was now recompensed. There they made great waste, and continued it as far as
the abbey of Cercamp, where the County of S. Poul begins; there they
soiourned two days for many reasons, especially for that they had resolved to
besiege the Castle of Renty. The K. army before Rentry and his desseines.
The D. of Vendosme departed thence with a good number of Cauallerie and foot,
training some artillery to go before to summon it; also to know whether any
body were left within Fauguemberg, which he purposed to raze, with all other
small fortes adjoining; to the end likewise that he might be able to bring
greater store of artillery, that which he had there being partly homecomed,
partly cracked and dismounted, much powder and munition having been spent
before the Towns and Castles which they had taken; the eight of August they
trauersed all the Countye of S. Poul, leaving Dorlan and Hedin on the left
hand, and Terroanne on the right, to encampe the night following at Fruges;
whence that night the Castle of Renty was again summoned, and answer made by
the Captain, The Emperor before Renty and his disseines.
that he would never yield it up, assuring himself of the succors which the
Emperor would bring unto him; who being informed of the K. coming thither, as
well in respect that forte was very prejudicial to the County of Boulonnois,
as to assay if they would hazard to fight with him and drive him out of the
Country, was departed from Arras, where he had mustered all his forces, with
which he approached as near unto the King as Terroanne on the Friday at night.
But the French knowing his intent to be to keep on the other side of the
Riuerh, a place strong by reason of the length and breadth of the wods which
stretched very far into the country, whereby succors might come unto him as well
of victuals as Soldiers, and all other sorts of munitions, and being there
fortified, his presence would easily succor and reskew the Castle with
whatsoever should be needful, yea of all sides ready to cut of and annoye
the besiegers, advised for the more sure, that the Constable with the Vantgarde
should pass into that part, and fortefie himself with trenches, to bemeete
with and prevent all occasions of surprise; and to cut of the way to any
succors which might be sent unto the Castle, bridges and boats were made upon
the little River, whereby the two Camps might the more easily succor one
another. Afterward all the light cauallerie being encamped at Fauquemberge,
this castle remained so penned in, as there was not one man able to enter in
without being discovered; notwithstanding the better to ascertaine the Emperor
of this siege, they caused to be planted on the top of a mountain on
Montereul side four Culuerins, to begin to batter these defenses, whilst they
advanced forward such great pieces as were taken and brought from the Towns
above the River of Sum, which came thither somewhat late, and only the
Satterday at night, but to make amends to this sloth, they made the approches
with such speed, as all was seen in battery by the next morrow,
notwithstanding any shower of Harquebuze shot, which they were able to send
out of the Castle, whence there was hurt the Captain Vauquedemars, one of the
most ancientest and experimented Captains of the old Ensigns, the which
redoubled unto the Emperor his doubt and fear of the place, seeing himself
without all means or hope to be able so much as to cause one man to enter in:
but in the end the grief and shame which he conceived, to suffer his Country
so to be destroyed, and before his eyes, and that this place should be taken
and enforced, so mingled themselves together, that making himself an enemy to
his fear, he resolved to try fortune, and to do his best whatsoever should
ensue thereon to succor it. Thereupon the same day he came to encampe hard by
the French, but for all that the artillery never ceased most furiouslye to
batter the Castle, and that in two places, to wit, on the Constables side and
on the Kings, the artillery being advanced, and planted on the very brinke of
the ditch, which battered a bulwark on the left hand, and a round tower within
the dungeon on the right; they shot likewise from the mountain a little below
the Zuizers Camp, with four culuerins to break the defenses, and you may not
doubt but in short time this castle was as violently battered and cannoned, as
any other place, so as the Emperor determined as the best way to raise them as
yet to approach nearer, and so lodged on the top, on the plain of a mountain,
between a little Village called Marque and Fauquemberg, where there was but
one little Valley of an hundred and fiftye pace large, and at the least as
steep, which divided the two armies, and the valley on the other side, where
the river runs which makes a marish, and ouerfloweth al round about the
Castle on the right hand. Besides a wood on the left between the Spaniard and
the French, above Fauquemberg, called the wood William, The Emperors and K.
Henry's desseines before Reinty.
which the Emperor thought good to sease upon to hinder their giving of the
assault, and to compel them by shot of Cannon into their camp, to dislodge
and quit the place. Now had the D. of Guise which commanded in the battle
watched all that night, as also the Prince of Ferrara, the D. of Neuers, the
Admiral, the Marshall de S. Andre, and other, assuring themselves that the
enemy would not fail to spy out the wood to lodge in, and therefore was
there set about 300. Harquebusiers in ambush, within certain little caves, and
some corselets which stood plain to be discovered, to the end the enemies
first addressing themselves to fight with them, might be enclosed in, the
easier to be defeated by the Harquebuziers: and so a little after at the point
of day, the scouts reported how they had heard a great noise, and descried
certain matches of Harquebuziers, the which himself afterward perceiving,
forbad them to discover themselves, but to tarry until they might be sure,
and upon that went back into the corpse de gnet, which was retired in the plain
toward the Camp. The Imperials still marched forward within the wood,
according to the report of some couriers, which they still sent before, and
perceiving nothing, went so far in that they found themselves enclosed within
this ambush, not as yet discovered: wherefore the French suddenly all at one
instant discharged so hottely on them, that they remained in the end so
astonished and beaten, as in seeing a number hurt, they began to fly and turn
their backs, glad that the day was no further forwards, and that the weather
was mistye. Now from the beginning of the day the batterye was continued more
furious then before, so as in a short space the breaches in every place grew
reasonable ready to give the assault: whereof the Emperor being advertised,
he was so angry, as the very same day being the 13. of August, about noone he
made a volley of artillery to be discharged, to give them warning within that
they should be of courage, and that their succors were at hand. Afterward
having concluded to give battle, (against the advice of the principal of his
council) he caused all his camp to be set in order, but he resolved first to
gain the wood, knowing the importance thereof, and at all hazards to chafe
away the French. Therefore having chosen out of all his companies of foot
about three or four thousand Harquebuziers of the best experienced, The
Imperial army to give battle to the French.
some corselettes, and Pikemen to supporte them, and about four thousand
horse, with four field pieces, carried upon four wheels, ready to turn
them upon any hand, (whereby they were afterward called the Emperors Pistols)
he caused them all to march right into the wood, the light Cauallerie under the
conduct of the Duke of Sauoy, and the Harquebuziers under Dom-Ferrant de
Gonzague. All along the Glade of the wood in descending toward Fauquemberg
marched a battle of Almanes, led by the Count John of Naissau, and the
Marshal of Cleues, on whose flancke marched a troop of Reistres of about
eighteen hundred or two thousand horse, under the conduct of the Count
Vulfenfort, who promised the Emperor to march that day upon the bellye of all
the Kings men at arms; followed not far of with a number of light
cauallerie, of about one thousand or twelve hundred horse, with four field
pieces more. The Harquebuziers then being entered into the wood, encountered with
the three hundred French, as fresh and with as good a will to recharge them as
they had done at the first. And thereupon grew fair and hot skirmishes. Now
albeit that the Imperials arrived there in far greater number, yet they
behaved themselves so valiantly that they kept them a long time back, so as
many remained on each side as well dead as hurt, and taken prisonners: among
other of the French, the Captain Fort, and his Lieutenant Courcelles. Hereupon
the Duke of Guise, who from the beginning had undertaken the defense of this
wood, and by his presence animated and seemed to grace these martial actions,
having carefully considered of the whole dessein of the Imperialles, advised
the King that by their countenance and fury wherewith they went to the combat,
he verily thought that that day should not pass without a battle. The King
then which was in the plain on this side the wood, about 5000. pace in length,
and 2000. in breadth, caused his battles of foot to be put in order, to
situate them in a place commoudious and easy to combat with the men at
arms, because that place was improper for them both together, The French army
represented before Renty to give battle.
as by the advice of the Constable and sundry other Princes and Captains, he
had the day before perceived. Notwithstanding for the better countenance and to
make head to the enemy, there was lodged both the one and the other as
commodiouslye as could be; the first battle of foot were French, the second
Almanes, the third Zuizers, which followed one another with Regiments of men at
arms ordained for their flancke on their right hand. And for as much as on the
left there was a little Valley, which as well from the quarter of the Zuizers
toward Fauquemberg, as toward the wood, widening made a glade easy and
commodious enough, as well to lodge foot as horse, in the opening of that
plain they set the most part of the rest of the Regimentes of men at arms
for the other flancke. And right before toward Fauquemberg was the D. D'aumale
with all the light Cauallerie, and certain Harquebuziers on foot to fight,
without keeping any order, to the end they might give notice if the enemy
should come that way. And in the mean space the Duke of Guise not being able
readily to have the K. answer upon such occurrents, being likewise no less
curious to draw the enemy into the place most aduantagious for himself, then
fearful of the loss of the three hundred Harquebuziers in the wood, in the
end resolved to make them retire from place to place, through the trauerses of
the wood, ever refreshing them with some companies of Cauallery, which
notwithstanding so increased the imperials courage, as assuring themselves of
victory, they caused their battles of Alamanes to march with all diligence
which always flankred them on the rightside, as they saw their harquebusiers
have advantage over the French. And even then Dom-Ferrant sent word unto the
Emperor that he should hasten the rest of his army, for the Vantgarde of the
French said he was already sore shakened, ready to set themselves in disorder:
the which the Emperor did, and his army passed all along the Valley above, and
at one of the corners of the wood himself tarried, to be partaker of the
pleasure or annoy of the good or bad which should fall out: it was then as the
K. answer came to the D. of Guise, that if occasion offered it self to receive
battle, he should not refuse it; that he would come himself thither in
person with as good a will to fight, as the most valiant of his whole army.
Then the Duke of Guise went back to his Regiment in the sight and face of all
upon the plain toward Fauque^berg; where of a famous warrier, The D. of
Guises speech to the gentlemen of his company.
gracious notwithstanding and with a smiling countenance, he used some words,
as well to advertise the Gentlemen, of the fair occasion which that day was
offered to attain honor, as to encourage those which might have any need; and
showed them all in general, how the day was come wherein God presented unto
them (in doing service to their Princes and increasing their honor and
particular reputation) the matter and true subject, to make themselves for ever
to be redoubted and feared of all the nations of the world, whereof the K.
assured himself so far, as he would honor this glorious victory with his
own presence, which indeed encouraged them in such sort, as having called
upon the name of God, and reco^mended their souls into his hands, The K.
answer to the Zuizers
every man prepared himself well and faithfully to perform his duty. In the
mean time the Constable passed over the river toward the Duke with a Regiment
of the Captain Glamay his footmen, who caused the first order a little to be
altered; and retired the battle of Zuizers toward Renty, who according to
their ancient custom, sent unto the King to demand some men at arms to
supporte them, but the K. answered them, how himself would live and dye with
them, and that he so far assured himself of their promise and good will,
that he determined no whit to abandon them, resolute to show unto them, how as
well in life, as point of death, if it were offered he would honor them as his
colleagues and faithful friends both to himself and his kingdom: whereat
they were so stirred up, as there was no other intention among them, but to
fight valiantlye for his service. Likewise as a testimonye of the pleasure
which the King received therein, he did that which I will show you in another
place. As all this was thus a handling, the Imperials were in such sort already
advanced upon the French, as they had recoyled them, and driven the^ out of the
wood so far, as their harquebuziers began to come forth, and show themselves
in front of the first battle of the French, ready to join with them, pelting
at them with a continual and marvelous noise of Harquebuze shot all along the
glade. The Imperial battle supported with Pistoliers and cauallerie, was
aproched with one hundred pace of the French, and there remained nothing but to
charge, at such time as the D. of Guise gave a sign to the D. of Nemours, to
charge with his regiment of light Cauallerie upon one of the corners of the
Pistoliers, and upon the other he set the Guidon of his own company, and
Tauannes to scour on their slancke, whereupon there began a most sore and
furious combat; but the French were in the end valiantly put back, and there
was slain the young Baron of Curton, Randan sore hurt, and his Lieutenant
D'Amanzay dead, the Cornet of Auannes sore hurt, and his horse slain under
him, Forges Guidon of the company of Tauannes slain, the Vicecount D'Auchy
Guidon of the Duke of Guises sore hurt, and sundry valiant men out of all the
companies, The second combat in which the imperials were overthrown.
as the Son of Pied-pape, young Iouy, Bourdilly, young Branches, and many
others; whose death, hurtes, and retreates gave such heart to the Imperialles so
well to hope, as they already encouraged one another, as having gained an
entire victory: whereupon the Duke of Guise and Tauannes, having assembled
their troops together again, the which the D. D' Aumalle with all the light
Cauallerie went to join, began with one front so furiously to charge upon the
Imperials, as they opened, and threw down the Pistoliers of Vuluenfort so
rudelye, as they themselves brake the battle of their Almanes to retire, who
might best, whilst that the Duke of Neuers who had his Regiment placed along
the glade toward Ranty, passed between the battle of the Almanes and the
French, to charge in a heap upon all the Spanish Harquebuzerie, which by
favor of their cauallerie was already come out of the wood, which they
performed so courageously, and with such violence, as they were all
overthrown and put to flight; yea in such disorder as they suddenly turned
their back, to escape and get into the wood, where there were taken and razed
seventeen Ensigns of footmen, five Cornets of horse, and four field pieces
which they found clean abandoned all along the glade. The Admiral then who
was the first which alighted before the battle of the French, caused a number
of Soldiers to leave their ranckes still to follow the victory, who entering
within the wood at the beginning made a great slaughter of their enemies,
ridding all such as they met of their miserable lives, by the cruel edge of
their sword. There were the Emperors Pistols found and brought unto the King,
whilst that the companies of men at arms pursued the victory all along the
glade and borders of the wood, especially the light Cauallerie and Tauannes his
company, which descended down into the bottom of the valley, where was
likewise defeated a great number of those which were come down out of the
wood, hoping to gain their Camp. The rest of the troops tarried upon the top
of the valley, upon which they straightwaies made the Emperors artillery to
play, which remained on the other board his side, whereby his people might
somewhat the more fauourablye retreat. But to answer him, the French was as
soon leuelled against the corner of the wood, which made his quickly recoyle
back, the battles of the footmen which were already come together upon this
top in the plain, still attending what might further ensue. During this time
the Emperor caused his Camp with all diligence to be razed, trenched and
fortified: doubting of a more hot pursuit. But the night coming on, was an
occasion to the French to pass the rest of the time in peace, and to content
themselves with the happy issue of this reencounter. Now for that the companies
of the men at arms of the D. of Guise, Neuers, Bourdillon, and Tauannes, were
the first which fought, and most hotly pursued their enemies, the King was so
highly contented therewith, as he Knighted the chief Captains and principal
members thereof. Among the rest Tauannes whom he greatly honored, and gave
unto him the order which he wore about his own neck, Number of the dead French
and Imperial.
using toward the rest great liberality, especially toward those as
presented unto him either Ensigns, Cornets, or artillery, which they had
taken or found abandoned. After the encounter the French Captains viewed over
their bands, to know those which had been slain or hurt, where there were
found of dead about two hundred or twelve score: but the Emperor lost there
thrice as many men: for the charge and onset of the French was at the first so
furious, as without respect of any, nor tarrying about prisonners, all such as
presented themselves before them, were hewn in pieces, so as the D. of Sauoy
and Dom-Ferrant to save themselves were feign to run into the thick of the
wood, where they remained so long, as it was a great time before any news
could be heard of Dom-Ferrant, so as he was esteemed either to be dead or
taken prisonner. And there was also taken a Colonel of the Almanes, which a
Harquebusier found within the wood sore hurt, who being kept by the Baron of
Fontenay, dyed a few days after in his hands. A Spanish Captain named de
Castres, who said he had been page to the Admiral, being abandoned for
dead, was taken by an other Harquebusier, to whom they gave so good
entertainment, as within few days after his wounds being brought into good
plight, for a small ransom he was sent away, and conveyed unto the Castle of
Renty. There was likewise taken prisonner, a gentleman of great virtue and
knowledge of the Emperors chamber, named De Silly, who afterward was employed
to mediate a peace between these two Princes.

After that the K. was retired with his battle into his first stand, the
Constable encamped the same night within the wood, with all the Vantgard, in the
very place of victory, but with small rest notwithstanding; for that all the
night the Imperials kept themselves in battle, the two armies remaining in
great doubt one of the other, for the French presumed how that the Emperor
being a courageous and magnanimous Prince, would never endure such a loss,
without doing of his best for revenge: but he seeing himself weak, and so
vnfauoured of fortune, knowing the puissance of the K. feared least he would
turn all his forces to defeat him for altogether. So as having with all
diligence possible, caused his Camp to be enclosed about round with great
trenches, by peep of day we might see them in so great forwardnes, as they
rested as impregnable. The same day notwithstanding to make an end of his part,
the K. sent the Constable to view whether there could be any access or means
to go search the^ out within their own fort, who gave advise of an
impossibility, without danger of loosing thereby a great number of valiant
men: so this day passed peaceably over on each side, still continuing for all
that the battery against the castle, until night that the Emperor caused all
his artillery to be discharged in sign of great joy, and rejoicing for the
good news which he had received of the defeat of Peter Strossy, and a great
number of the French party in Italy. I will tell you else where how the matter
was: upon this the fifteenth day of the month, the retreat of the army into
France was resolved of in full council, as well for want of provisions for
horses, as to change the air, which was already infected and corrupted with
the stinche of carrins and dead horses, whereof the plague is quickly
engendered, and other diseases very contagious in an army; alleging in like
sort that the K. would not lose so many brave men as followed him, before so
little a place, and of no worth; but for all that the K. meant first to
advertise the Emperor thereof, and sent him word that it was not for any doubt
of him, and that if he would assure him that he would meet him, he would tarry
for him four long hours on the way, as he did: for having caused the Carts
and baggage to be sent away, the army wholly remained in battle more then
three hours in the same place, where the Monday before they had fought. But
none presenting themselves, and knowing how that the Imperialles were close
shut up in their Camp, having in their sight set fire on all the Villages
about, they began with a soft march to retire, looking back sometimes to see
if they were followed. And so late enough arrived at Montcaure, a league from
Montereul, where they soiourned 5. days together, still to learn out and
understand the enterprises of the emperor, the which as long as the French
forces were still assembled, the King might more easilye prevent, and meet
with them if they should put into the field. But having certain intelligence
how the army was not as yet departed from their first lodging in the plains
of Marque, and that the Emperor expressly tarried to see the reparations and
amendements of Rent, the K. purposed in like sort to give some rest and
refreshing to his own; Notwithstanding that before the five days were out,
want of fourage and evil air of the marshes caused them to dislodge and come
nearer to Montereul, where they soiourned five other days entire; the K. being
lodged in the Charter house, and the Camp pitched all along the little river
of Cauche, where the English and Scottish companies received an evil bobbe, in
being scattered and lodged two leagues farther the^ the Vantgarde, in a village
called Marenlo, where the imperials having received advertisement thereof, and
being guided by one of the same village, were to surprise them at midnight, so
as their lodgings being set on fire, some of the masters, servants, and horses
tied were burned, some slain, and some carried away prisonners: whereupon the
Emperor being retired to S. Omer, without having any means to be able to
undertake any matter of great importance or damage to the French; as also that
the Winter and evil weather threatened him, the K. departed thence with the D.
of Guise, and certain gentlemen of his house to go to Compeugne, after he had
well munitioned and fortefied the garrisons of the towns of Ardres, and
Bolongne, to make head and keep strong against his enemy, if he would besiege
him: the Constable remaining chief of the overplus of the army, as well to
keep it united, as the better and more readily to be able to provide for
whatsoever the Emperor could undertake: whose guiles the French have always
feared, especially upon the end of a war; whereupon they took occasion to
charge now and then upon his camp, as well thereby to know and learn some
thing, as to keep scoute for the fouragers, who were feign to go very far to
recover victuals and fourage for their horses, who having no more left to
nourish them withal, they were enforced again to dislodge and pass over the
river on the other side, where the army was pitched and encamped in the
villages of Brameu, Espimeu, Beaurin, and al along the river shore. They
tarried there certain days, The K. army dissolved.
fearing least the Emperor should besiege Montreul, Ardres, or Dourlan:
notwithstanding being advertised how his Soldiers for want of pay, victuals,
and other commodities, dissolved themselves: the constable not to consume the
rest of the victuals of the frontire (which were already greatly diminished
and grown dear) sent home the rirebands to their houses, and dismissed the
Zuizers well contented and satisfied, as well with their pay, as with the order
of knighthood bestowed by the K. upon Mandosse their General, and upon the
Captains Theodore Inderhalden Colonel of the Cantons, and Petroman Clery
Colonel of the towns, and Aonis who was afterward the K. Ambassador to the
Grizons, a few days after being accompanied with the Marshal S. Andre, he came
unto the K. who gave the conduct of the rest of the army to the D. of Vendosme:
whereupon the emperor who had always delaied and dissembled his determination,
seeing his forces diminished suddenly, called back certain companies which
before he had caused to depart the camp, to draw toward Hedin. The which
the D. of Vendosme foreseeing, and that he meant to be revenged in burning the
flat country, as the French had done his, caused his camp to dislodge, still to
accost him and hold him in such awe, as he should not scatter his army, so as
having passed the river of Authie, he encamped that night at Dampierre, until
the next morrow about noone, when as he was advertised how the most part of
the Imperial army and cauallery was come down to Auchy, a Castle appertaining
to the Count of Aiguemont, and had fired the same, broken and defeated certain
companies of light cauallery, which the Duke doubting of their coming to
hinder the passage of the river had sent thither. The which caused him suddenly
to raise his Camp from Dampierre, and imagining by the course which his enemy
took, that he meant to besiege Abbeuille or Dorlan, he approached nearer to
these two places, the which he furnished and fortefied with what ever was
necessary. Afterward on the morrow being the first of September, he passed
the river of Sum, and pitched his Camp at Pondormy, a place very commodious
both to keep the Country and passage of the river: the same day the Imperials
began to make waste, and to burn the flat Country which the French had
abandoned, for two or three leagues compass, encamping at Saint Requier, two
leagues from the French, whom they thought should not dislodge thence without
battle offered, or some charges or other braueries performed: an occasion
that the next morning early the D. of Vendosme sent his light cauallerie with
three hundred men at arms to supporte them, under the conduct of the Prince of
Anguian, who approached as near their Camp as he was able, and kept them so as
they should not scatter to burn and destroy the villages, holding them in
such awe and subjection, that they always marched in troops close together:
at night the French overthrew at their tail certain wagons laden with
victualles, which were nothing but apples, bonillons, and very naughtye bread:
the which caused them to think that in so great want and necessity of victuals
they would not long keep themselves encamped: notwithstanding they marched
afterward all along the river of Authie, and set fire on the Castles and
Villages along as they passed. As at Dampierre, Daurye, Marchy, Marchye,
Mainthenay, and diverse other places: an occasion that the Duke of Vendosme sent
six score men at arms as well of his company as of the Marshall S. Andres,
with 9. Ensigns of foot to lodge in the Town of Montereul, which the
Imperialles made countenance as though they meant to besiege: whereof being
advertised, and changing their purpose, they returned back to pass the River
of Authye, and descended into the Marshes below Hedin, between the river and
an other which comes out of the County of S. Poul, in a place called Mesnil,
fit to be fortefied for the keeping and assurance of the baliadge of Hedin, and
county of S. Pol. Then on the twelfth of September they began to rear and
build up a forte, having for the more speedy dispatch of the defense, leauied a
great number of Pionners and laborers out of the Countries about, which they
did without any let, for besides that they were within their lands, the French
army was maruelously diminished and lessened every day, both by reason of
sickness among the Soldiers, as of the companies which were sent unto the
towns, which were threatened with a siege at hand. This done, the D. of
Vendosme knowing his Soldiers to be very wearye with the long travail of this
voyage, to refresh and solace them, brake up his Camp; and sent certain
companies of men at arms of the most tired, to winter in their ancient
Garrisons, and his light cauallerie in places nearest to the enemy, and to
help and succor the poor people, to husband and sow their fields The foot
companies of French, English, and Scottish, were lodged in the Towns and
Borroghes all along the the bank of the River of Some. The Almanes of the
County of Reingraue, and Baron of Frontenay, at S. Esprit de Reux; which they
caused to be fortefied for a counterforte to Mesmil, and those of the Count
Rocdolphe, and Reifberge, took their way toward Piemont and Italy.

The History of France.
THE THIRD BOOK.
YOu have already seen how the French and the Imperialles sought out one
another with as great stomach as ever: each of them the more forward, thorough
the presence of their Princes, which as then conducted the armies, when as
Henry with great fury battered the castle of Renty, and had carried it, had not
the Emperor brought thither all his forces, the better to encourage them which
were besieged, and allaye the fury of the French, by the skirmishes and hot
sallies which he caused to be undertaken by the cheifest of his army; so as the
Erench albeit they carried away the honor of the memorable reencounter which I
have mentioned, (in which the Spanish Fanterie put to rout, the Almane
Pistoliers of Count Vul-uensort, since called Reisters, were broken and put to
flight by the French Cauallerie) were yet in the end constrained to quit the
place, retyring themselves in march, as if they should have presented battle
to the Imperials, from which the Emperor kept them thorough the favor of his
trenches. Afterward the two Princes having for the reasons which I alleged
elsewhere, broken and dissolved their armies, whereof they placed a good part in
the garrisons of their frontiers, the better to be able continually to
undertake an enterprise more secretly, and as opportunity served, held
themselves a long time upon their guard, without much discovering themselves,
through the discommodities of the Autumn, and violence of the blustering
Winter: employing themselves only in some surprises and secret intelligences,
whereof very few succeeded so well as the undertakers desired. These two
Princes in the mean space pricked forward, no less with envy, then a
reciprocal ambition, boiling with a worldly desire of revenge, by the
remembrance of so great losses, old and new offenses, made ready al kind of
preparatiues for a war at hand, and much more bloudye then the former; so as
the brute being spread throughout France of the rodes which the Imperial
garrisons still made, the French thereby soon took occasion to march under the
Marshall of S. Andre, for to surprise, scale, at break of day, and cut into
pieces, whomsoever they should find in arms, in the Castle of Cambresy. At
what time the Spaniards had notwithstanding the favor of a fair war, to
retire themselves whether it liked them best. Mariembourg.
About the beginning of the same spring Bouillon as the K. lieutenant in the
absence of the D. of Neuers Governor of Champaigne, was sent thither to rescue
those of Mariembourg: afterward to enterprise upon the enemy as occasion
should be offered, for the Imperialles meant no less to the place then to the
Garrison, because that this Town (having before been a Village and pleasant
seat of Mary widdowe to Lewis King of Hungary, which she had caused to be
most curiously builded and fortefied, whilst that she was gouernesse of the
Country for the Emperor her Brother) was builded and raised up much stronger,
and far better provided then before: yea the K. would needs bestow his own
name thereof, as this Princess before had done hers: which notwithstanding
more happy in that, Pope July 3. deceased.
could not out of the memory of the people bordering round about.

The three and twentieth of March Pope Iulye the third of that name deceased,
after having taken great pains in the latter end of his years, to reconcyle
these two great Lords, whom himself before had set to debate: an occasion
that the ninth day of April the Cardinal Marcel Ceruin of Montpulcien in
Tuscane, was chosen and proclaimed Pope, who by no means would change his name
as the rest were wont to do. He was Bishop of Nicastre, Pope Marcel poisoned.
and Cardinal of the tittle of Holy cross in Jerusalem, who died poisoned
for all that, as some affirm, the two and twentieth day of his election, for
that he was of too good a life. But in very truth as he was before given to be
sick of the yellowe Iaunders, the disease grew so sore upon him in his old
years, as he dyed the three and twentieth day of his Papacye. True it is that
a few days before his death he made himself be crowned with very small
expenses, and very modestly. Now as he was very wise, so men had a great hope
that he would correct many things in the Romish Church, and especially that he
would chase away all the dissolution and superfluity thereof, from whence the
brute of his poisoning did grow: for indeed he abolished the superfluities
of gardes, and other honors which the first Bishops of Rome knew not once what
they meant. Pope Paul 4.
Afterward the three and twentieth of May the Cardinals those in their
conclaue, the Cardinal John Pierre Caraffa, Deane of the College called
Theatin Neapolitain, Iesuistes.
named Paul the fourth, esteemed to be a man very eloquent and learned. The
first author (being a Monk at Venise) of Iesuistes, of whom I will speak
else where. For at diverse times, and throughout all the Provinces of
Christendom, yea as far as the East and West Indies, they have engraven and
thundered out the name of their profession, thorough the merit of their pains,
incredible hazardes and cruelties, which they have suffered among the
Barbarians, for the name of Christ.

In this time Philip of Austria, by Mary King of England, as well to appease
the mutinyes which were grown between the English malcontentes thorough the
alliance with a Stranger, and other grieved with the change of the Protestant
Religion for the Roman, as the better to entertain traffic and other
commodityes with the French, one part of the great riches of that insularie
kingdom, curious on the other side of the general good and repose of
Christendom, refused not with Charles the Emperor his Father, and Henry the
second, to hearken to a universal peace, especially at the persuasions of the
English Cardinal Poole, who having passed between the Emperous and the King
of France, did maruelouslye solicit them to a good accord: whereunto the
rather to induce them, he insisted both by words and wrighting. Among other
means and persuasions, wherewith he served himself to bring them to this
point, he used these.

Whilst that you make civil war one upon another, the Turk stretches out
at large his dominion, Cardinal Pole his persuasions to a peace.
and has already taken two fortes by land and Sea, to wit Belgrade and Rhodes,
by means whereof he has made his way as far as Bude, and is grown master
of the Danube; that if God had not raised him up the K. of Persia for an
enemy, it is very likely that long since he had put all Christendom under his
obedience. By this occasion many false Christians are so multiplied in diverse
places, with such corruption of all kind of discipline, as well
ecclesiastical as civil, as your power is not great enough to punish and
correct them, which the mutinies grown in so many places well declare, the
offices of religion left, the schisms and heresies which in the mean time
engender and grow throughout all Countries; you ought to consider your own
duty, and above all that you be Princes of christian religion. And albeit that
God has permitted Satan; (the author of all mischief, who goes about to
sifte the Church like Corn) to move war among you who are the two most
principal and noblest members of the Church, yet has he not permitted his
malice to exceed profane and civil actions: for he has counter guarded you
entirely in one religion, in one same faith and opinion, assembled and united
in one self same body of the Church: otherwise it were not possible to find
means to set you at accord. And albeit that many other Princes are revolted
from the Church, and that the enemy of mankind has spread his malice
throughout, God notwithstanding has looked upon you in pity, and brought to
naught the attemptes of the Devil. In which as for a certain sign of his
bounty and clemency toward you, he shows that finally he will be served by
you, and unite you with one fraternall bond, together with his Vicar on earth,
to take away these so perilous discordes, and restore again peace, as well in
the civil as ecclesiastical estate.

Pole alleged many other things to this purpose, greatly threatening them
with the wrath and vengeance of God, if they did not leave of these their
passions, and take compassion of the poor people so greatly afflicted. And
albeit that he prevailed nothing, yet for so much as the affairs of England
came to his wish, he insisted in such sort, as he caused the Emperor and
the King of France to come to this point, to send Ambassadors on the one
part and the other. The Queen of England who carried her self neuter in this
cause, caused a place to be chosen neat and proper in the field, between
Cales, Ardes, and Graueline, Towns under the subjection of England, France,
and Burgondie, situate as in a tryangle, then having made cast a trenche
round, she caused four lodginges to be reared up for the time only, but
commodious enough; where the three and twentieth day of May the Ambassadors
assembled. On the Emperors part the Bishop of Arras, among other for the
French King were the Cardinal of Lorraine, and the Constable; for England to
mediate the Peace, was Pole, the Earl of Arundel, and Paget. The brute hereof
being spread abroad, gave men occasion to think and hope for much, especially
those who understood not the deapth of the differences: for there was question
made of the Duchies of Milan, Bourgondie, Sauoye, Piemont, The place appointed
to treat of the Peace.
Corse, Navarre, Lorraine, Luxe^bourg, of the Towns of Thou, Verdun and Metz:
matters having been long and stiffelye debated, as among other difficulties,
the English mediators were of opinion that the knowledge of certain of the
differents, were fit to be reserved to the deciding of a Council, they all
departed thence without doing ought. The tenth of June Ferdinande and the
estates of the Empire; besought the Emperor by their letters, that in treating
of peace, he would have especial regard to what the K. of France had taken
away from the Empire. Now nothing being accorded between the Ambassadors, the
Emperor wrote back fifteen days after to the estates in like substance.

The Emperors letters to the states.
I Greatly rejoiced to see that you took pity of those whom the enemy to my
self and the Empire has sacked. I always had especial care that they should
be restored into their former estate, and before I received your letters, I
gave express charge to my Ambassadors, and principal Counselors deputed for
a peace, that they should in any wise press this, without yielding one inche.
And albeit that in all the treaties of peace which I have made, I thought in
respect of the public tranquillity they would not be to obstinate, yet they
are departed away without doing ought, and notwithstanding I do not refuse a
peace for the good of Christendom, so as they make me any reasonable offers,
and as opportunity shall be offered. I will strain myself to get such goods
as have been plucked from the Empire restored into their former estate.


See how God which has the hearts of Kings in his hands, making each party to
judge the others demands to unreasonable, would not permit Christendom so
soon to enjoy a benefit so much desired. In sort that each one keeping
himself upon fear of a surprisal, easily made his neighbor think, how the
cariadges of the Garrisons round about tended to more high enterprises. So as
these two Princes tickled with the like fear, and quickly taking one another
actions for a sufficient defiance of war, as Henry divided his men where he
saw it most needful, the Emperor first put his army into the field of
twenty thousand fighting men under Martin Roussan bastard of Cleues, who after
many roades, burnings, and incredible wastes all along the Meuse, encamped at
Deux Giuets, minding to build a fort upon that mountain, at the foot whereof
this river runs, there by to bridle all the quarters round about, and make a
sure retreat there for all such as were able to endomage the French. The D. of
Neuers in the mean space having taken good order for Maizieres, and other
places of importance, resolved by the K. commandment to victual well
Mariemburg. And to that end having speedily and secretly made ready all
preparations as well of men as victuals, munitions, and companies under the
Comte of Retheloix, he sent three hundred harquebusiers as well French as
English and Scots, mounted to discover and bring back word to the chief of
the eight hundred light horse, which followed them, what they should discry:
who with the leader of the vantgard of two hundred men at arms, and eight
ensigns of fantassins which marched after, and a number of harquebusiers close
to the wings of the wagons, provided thereto whatsoever was needful according
to the generals commaundment, who led the battle of three hundred men at
arms, and eight ensigns of fantassins, having on his back the arrieregard of
two hundred men at arms, then one hundred Archers to hasten them, and to
advertise the chief of every occurrence. In such sort as this order being thus
followed, joined thereto the speedines of the march, and well disciplined
obedience of the soldiers, was the cause that five hundred wagons as well of
the K. munition as voluntary Merchants entered in without any disturbance,
which either the enemy or badnes of the way could yield unto them, fully
persuading themselves throughout all the march, which was eight long leagues,
that they were able enough to make head to the enemy, when, where, and with
what troops soever he would advance, though he were dubble as strong as the
French. Afterward the D. having placed there, and encouraged Du Fumel
governor, and left fifty men at arms, two hundred light horse, and nine old
companies of the best soldiers on foot, departed thence, and making his
vantgard of the hindermost, kept on another way to visit Rocroy, where the
Capitane La Land was. So the Garrisons of Gampaigne, frontires of Haynaut, and
countries about being well provided, the imperial army was as soon dislodged
thorough the infection and discommoditie of victuals which they there endured.
So as Martin Roussan being dead and many other, the better sort were sent to
Giuets. Whether the D. of Neuers marched with his troops: against whom the
imperials skirmishing, and setting on them with many salies, maintained and
doubled by their reciprocal succors, had soon enough recorded a memorable
reencounter, considering the advantage and evident favor still turning on the
French party, had not Henry expressly forbidden his Leiutenant to fight, but
in great, and in the field without assailing them in their fort. So as being
retired and dispersed into Garrisons, the rest of the time passed over mildly
until the midst of August, when the Emperor having sent the Prince of Orange
with new forces to reassemble his troops, set forth an army under the
general of the house of Challons: the effects whereof notwithstanding was but
to keep in the French, and raise up the forte A Couins near Mariembourg,
which was after called Philippe Ville. Besides the Amirall Gaspard of Coligny
governor of Picardie, took such order within his frontires as he left nothing
at random. Anthoine of Vendosme, had surrendered that government into the K.
hands, at such time as being married to Ioane of Albert, soale heir to Henry
of Albert, he went to take possession of the kingdom of Navarre, Duchy of
Albert, Earldom of Foix, Armignac, Bigorre, and Soueraintie of Bearn, after
the decease of his Father in law. Since notwithstanding as some of the
Garrisons of Picardie mingled with 15. hundred horse of the Rerebandes, whom
they term the companies of the nobles, and four hundred pioners had so
happily ouerrunne the country round about under La Iaille their general, as
they all returned laden with a rich navy inestimable booty, Hausimont
governor of Bapaume, finding them between a wood a village and a river, (the
passages whereof he caused to be broken down and kept) without skouts,
without order, without any fear of the enemy, and without heart, charged them
so roundly with a few men, as in less then naught, he made them leave together
with their courage al their rich pickkerie, yea and their very lives at his
devotion. The wood and the river notwithstanding saved a great number, La
Iaille hurt, and more then a third part prisoners the rest died in the place.
The which the imperials took so greatly to their advantage, as they could not
speak of any other more notable exploite, so far as it grew to a scoff among
them, how they had taken the nobles of France without weighing the^. Albeit
that these troops were not indeed furnished for the most part but of
Ronturiers, unnoble every kind of way, or of some servants which the old or
sick Lords, widows and orphelins had sent thither: the gentlemen having
been all retired to the ordinances of the K. who ought in respect of his own
honor, and profit of his subjects to reform such and like lewd abuses, as are
committed in the companies of bands and rerebands. In sum the enemies
encouraged with such a success, took heart of grace to venture further upon
Picardie: for the defense whereof the D. of Guise retired into the town of his
own name, the Admiral into his government, and the K. himself advanced as far
as Villiers Cottorets, the better to assure and dispose his forces where he
should see need: yet they kept much at this stay, and within a little after
the forces of the imperials dissolved without performing any great matter.

The state of Piemont.
IN this time notwithstanding whilst they reposed themselves under a good
guard, the French and imperials awakened but too often for the worst in
Piemont, under the Marshall de Brissac, and D. of Alua Leiutenants for their
Soueranes: for the Marshall having opened the passages of La Vaudote and of the
Alps, thereby to give a more easy entry to all occurrences, as also in
Lombardie and Italy, by the surprisall which he had made the winter before of
Yuree, and the voluntary yielding of Bielle, withal appurtinances unto it
resolved at the spring to stretch out further the bonds of his government.
First he fortefied Santia which some call Saint Iaco, a place clean razed
down, whereunto having given a square form, and a great bulwark on every
flank, defended with two high platformes, discovering the whole circuit a
Culuerins length, and furnishing it besides, with whatsoever the art of that
time was able to yield, he made it very sufficient to command the whole plain
without any subjection: closing up the passage of Verceil, Cresentin, and all
Lombardie, Captain Saluoson.
so far as he brideled the commings forth and succors of Vulpian, which he
determined to famish, if he were not able to enforce it at the second siege
which he purposed to lay there. Afterward he seized upon Crepacuore, the
better to open his way, and keep the passage free, attending the execution of
the enterprise which Saluoison one of his Captains was to make upon Casal, a
place of the greatest importance and best defended of all that quarter. This
chefetaine having reasonably well profited in learning, in which he was
nourished and brought up by his parents, that by the desert thereof he might
come to greater preferment, retired himself from the Universities for
occasions slight enough. Whereby giving himself to carry the sword, and to
make profession of arms, he could not long endure to live in France without
seeing of Piemont: where the exercise of arms pleased him in such sort, as
being first enroled in the muster Book, then thorough his own merit honored
with the degree of Corporal, which got him the halbard, afterward an ensign
of a company of fanterie, in the end was as well thought of by his Master of
the camp, as mounting by all the degrees of war he grew marvelous well
known and recommended of every man. Rich notwithstanding in honors and
friendship more then wealth, or other recompenses, (which such as carry not a
gentle heart prefer before all gentilitie) so far as he was made governor of
Verrue: where he wrought and addressed an enterprise which I will declare unto
you, for an instruction to such as will give them to follow the like train of
arms. Having got good intelligence of the town of the people and munition
which was there, by means of one Fantarolle, a Merchant of Pont de sture who
did ordinarily trafique thither: and having made ready all his preparatiues to
scale it by night, whilst a marriage of one of the most notable inhabitants was
solemnised, where Figuerol governor of the place, which the chiefest of the
garrison and country was assembled, the Physicians which he sent to fetch
from Casal under the color of a counterfaite sickness, to take away all
suspicion which might arise, being no sooner come, but he with Birague,
Vimerocat, and a number of soldiers, which found the guards, sentinels and
other the inhabitants almost all a sleep, made himself master of the town,
after a little sheding of their blood which offered to resist him, seasing on
the market place, gates, carfoxes, and other places of importance, thorough the
help of a number of soldiers, which he before had caused to come in, clad in
country folks apparel, as if they had meant to sell their fruits to the
inhabitants. The count of Ladron notwithstanding; chief of the Almanes, which
he quickly got together: kept the place a long time against Saluoison and the
Marshall himself, whose forces suppressed him soon enough, whilst that
Figuerol, and a number of Spanniards, amassed at the cry of France, got have
clad into the Citadel, which the Marshall of Brissac ready with the Cannon
battered, and carried away in four and twenty hours, with condition of life
saved to those that held it, who went away, without carrying any of the
munition, whether it best liked them. Thus the tenth day of March, one thousand
five hundred fifty and five, the store of provisions which was prepared for
the recovery of Piemont, was taken, and Saluoison established governor of the
place, whence the assurance of the greter part of the Marquisat of Montferrat
depended, which was already in the K. hands, as being the Key of all that
province, and gappe of al Lombardie: afterward with the same foot he seized
of all the forts about, and pushing forward toward Alexandria, battered,
took, and ruined Poman, Saint Saluadour, and other little places not able to
hold out, and impossible to be fortefied so soon as he desired, the better to
open to himself the way to Milan. Joint that he found it more expedient to
remit his forces, and increase his army, which he purposed to put into the
field, then to divide the^ into Bicoques in danger to loose them all upon the
coming of so great an army as the D. of Alua prepared against him.

In April 1555. there grew a notable change in Italy about the free estate of
Syene, touching the principality thereof. To the which Cosme of Medices newly
created Archduke of Tuscane had aspired of a long time: as well for that this
common wealth being of so great force and scope was enclosed within his lands
of Tuscane, as to render the effects of his power conformable to the title
which had been given unto him. In respect that the accidents therein grew
very diverse and were strangely handled, me thinks it very reasonable that
the course thereof be researched even from the first original. The Emperor
being seized of Siene in Tuscane, had placed there for governor Don Diego de
Mondoze with a Spannish garrison: against whom, having begun a Citadell under
color of doing it for the towns defense, but carrying himself to severe
toward the inhabitants they al conspired to set them selves at liberty:
foreseeing that the Emperor would bring in the forces of the Florentine their
enemy against them, and that the Citadell was builded on the way to Florence.
Mendoze in the mean time under color of defending the people against the
insolences of the Nobles, caused them to lay a side their armies, but
exercising his rigor afterward on both parties: who being accorded and
forgetting their old quarrels, let the French to understand how rudely they
were handled, aduertising them of the strange desseins of the Spanniards
throughout all Italy. Against whom they besought succor, beseeching to be
received under their protection, especially considering that this Principality
would be a very fit thing for the K. the better to bridle the Imperials in
Italy. Concluding that Kings being established to succor the afflicted, and
that Siene having been at al times affectionate unto the French, deserved not
to be refused in so just a request which brought unto him nothing but honor
and profit, with a marvelous comfort to all Italy. In the end the succors
which they demanded were promised. And albeit that Cosme had advertised
Mendoze, of all the proceeding hereof: yet he nothing fearing the Sienois being
bridled in and unarmed, set very light by the aduertisment. So as the
conspirators, and other fugitives thoroughout all Italy levied in the K. name
six thousand men under the conduct of Nicolas Earl of Petiglian, The Turks
scoured the coast of Tuscane.
of Hieronime Pisan, and Marie de Saint Flour with a number of Cauallerie. Now
as it fell out that in this time Dragut Raise a famous Corsaire, and chief of
the Turks army by sea scowred all along the coast of Italy, the K. enemies
took occasion thereby to make the brute to run, how that he was come
thither to put certain ports of Tuscane into the French men's hands, which
came by sea in Galleys from Marseiles to the succors of the Sienois. So as the
Spanniards began to arm themselves, fortefie places, and to demand succor of
the Duke, who sent eight hundred soldiers of proof to Mendoze, seasing
themselves of the places and passage of Siene, whereat the inhabitants were so
stirred up, as within a few days after, they caused the Earl of Petiglian
secretly to enter in, with forty thousand men, who drove the Spanniards out of
Siene, with a great slaughter notwithstanding both of the one part and the
other. The rest of the Spanniards got them into the Citadell, and into the
co^uent of preaching Friars, which they had fortefied. But afterward with the
eight pieces of artillery, which was taken from them, they drove them out of
the fortes, the Earl of Saint Flour ariuing there, with two thousand soldiers
which rested of the leauie. In such sort as they took the convent, and
afterward the Citadell, the most part of the chefetaines with the Florentine
Capitanes retyring themselves, and so all together by an accord made with the
Citizens, they departed out of Siene, and seized of Orbitelle a place seated
in a Marsh, but every way fit to annoy the Sienois. Hereupon the Emperor
being constrained to quitte Metz, and retired into Germany, where he
understood of the success of his affairs in Italy, commanded the viceroy of
Naples Dom Garzie de Toledo, that assembling together all the forces which he
possibly could, he should block in the Sienois as much as in him lay. Which he
accordingly did in January 1548. with twelve thousand footmen and fifteen
hundred horse, as well Almanes as Neapolitanes. In the mean time the K. had
sent the Cardinal of Ferrare to Siene, and De Terms with two thousand
pioners, assisted with the D. of Some, Earl of Saint Flour and other of the
Vrsins, fortefying the places as they should see need. Corneille Bentinuogle
entered into Rosy with fifteen hundred soldiers. John de Thurin with three
hundred men had the charge of Mont-alcin; Malian was given to Chiarmont, and La
Turrite was governor thorough Galeas de Saint Seuerin with three hundred men.
Ciusi to Paul and Jordan Vrsins with two thousand men under Asinolonga. At
Monticelle were Cipierre, Guy de Bentiuogle, and the Earl of Petiglian with
five hundred light horse, at Port Telamon was the Earl of Mirendolle, and a
Satean, Ioachin a Gascoine Captain accompanied with two hundred men. So as all
de Terms his forces divided thoroughout all the garrisons amounted to twelve
thousand footmen besides the Citizens in great number all enemies to the
Spanniards and Florentines. But there was not above five hundred horse: every
man travailing to fortefie and provide for their places, De Terms and other
even to the very women took marvelous pains to assure La Capitalle, whilst
that the viceroye ouerranne the country, and attempted the towns, which he
thought to carry by open force, surprise, or intelligence. Conducting the
army with Ascanio de La Corn, he took some, and was forced to discampe
before other, as at Moultacin, which was succored with the men which Bellegard
nephew to De Terms caused to enter in. The intelligence which he had in Siene
was discovered, and albeit the Cardinal committed him unto prison which
carried the news, yet he set him again at liberty, whereupon this Prelate was
ever since suspected of treason.

In this time did Charles D. of Sauoye, driven out of his country by the King
of France, leaving for heir of all his rights his only Son Philibert
Emmanuel: D. of Sauove.
to whom for recompense of many services the Emperor gave the Earldom of
Ast to enjoy it until he should be able to recover his own inheritance.
Charles was buried at Verceil almost in magnificence Royal. In the mean space
the Marshall Brissac Leiutennant general for the K. in Piemont, having taken
Yuree and Verceill without the Castle, and pilled the treasures of the Sauoyon
within the Church of Saint Eustace, astonished many men in Lombardie. But
approaching near Milan, Fernand Gonzaque came very fitly with forces for the
Emperor. An occasion that Brissac retired back to Yuree, and quitted Verceil
which he was not able to keep without the Citadell.

The Imperials then not able to master Siene retired by little and little: so
as De Terms had leisure enough to pass into Corse, Isle of Corse.
and there to take the Town of Saint Florent and Boniface, a port of the Sea,
in times past the port of Siracuse, from the Genowaies which governed there in
part. From whence retiring into France, being called back by his Prince, he
left behind him a good Garrison, and Jordan Vrsin his Majesty's Lieutenant to
command there, with a number of French Captains. The King in the mean time
to be revenged of the Duke of Florence, who held the Emperors cause against
him and the Sienois, De Terms being called home, sent Pierre Strossy for his
Lieutenant General into Tuscane, with a number of men at arms, charged to draw
unto him his Brother the Prior of Capoue, who was retired from the service of
the French, the which he did, and went with him to La Mirandelle to raise there
an army. Being arrived at Siene, and communicating his charge with the
Cardinal of Ferrara, he thought it not best that he should declare himself so
soon for many reasons: especially for that he had no just occasion to war
against the Florentine, except it were founded upon the ancient and immortal
hatred between the Strozzis and Medices, Strozzy notwithstanding levied at
Rome, Vrbin, and other places, where men make market of their life, as many men
as he was able: whereof the Florentine advertised Pope July, exhorting him to
drive the French out of Tuscane, and suppress the glory of the Sienois,
promising him that that done, he would give his daughter in marriage to the
nephew of his holiness, and give her a better portion then all the rest of his
children, saving the Prince: setting down in like hand unto the Emperor the
danger of his estates in Italy, if the King should make himself more great in
Tuscane, and the means which might grow unto him both in Lombardy and the
kingdom of Naples: in such sort as the Pope and the Emperor joining themselves
with him, gave charge to Iacques Le Medecin, Marquess of Marignan, a valiant
and wise Chief to leauie an army to this effect: who gathering together all
his forces, and assuring himself in his espials and diligences, more then any
other means, did so much as the Sienois fearing nothing, and forgetting the
charge which their Governor had given unto them, to finishe the fortifications
of their Town: Rodolphe Baglion Perusin general of the light cauallerie
coming about the beginning of January 1554. by night to Siene, with such
diligence, and so secret was without the care of Laurens de Chastillon, who
made the round upon the walls, the Town had become imperial: yea the
Florentines themselves confessed that after the assault well defended, Syene
desieged by the Marquis of Marignan.
if the Sienois had but salied out upon them, tired with so long travail and
sleep, they had been all defeated. But the Cardinal fearing least they might
have some intelligence within the town, contented himself with those which
were slain on the diches and rampire: the Maquesse notwithstanding encamping
before the Town, wasted the whole Country; afterward he battered the town so
furiously, as he had put them in great necessity, had not Strozzy who already
had well furnished the strong places of the Country, by his entry into the
Town, encouraged the hearts of the besieged, and diminished as much the hope of
the enemies. Of whom having understood how Baglion and Ascane de la Corn had
enterprised upon Chiusi one of the twelve ancient Cities of Hetruria, he went
to charge them with six hundred Soldiers so hottely, as Baglion remaining
there dead, and de La Corn prisonner, (afterward sent captive into France)
the affairs of the Emperor began to grow in evil case. Ioynte that the
King to make himself the stronger in Italy, sent over and above the supplye
of five thousand soldiers Zuizers and Gascons, with some light Cauallerie
promising besides to send unto him succors by Sea, which entered into Siene
without the enemies being witting thereof at all. The which emboldned Strossi
to come forth with six thousand footmen, and five hundred chosen horse, many
Sienois following him, whose going forth was no less concealed from the
Imperials then their entrance in. Afterward having given Moriane, (a place
appertaining to the Luguois) for rendeuons unto his army which was to come out
of Lombardie, he ouerranne diverse places of the Flourentines. He took
Montalcin and Montcarles, which he fortefied to the great astonishment of the
Duke of Flourence, who fearing to loose his own while he sought for an
others, caused the Marquess to retire from the siege, to defend the Country
of Flourence, because that Strossi his forces were joined unto him. Then the
Marquess finding him self not to be strong enough, put himself within
Pescia, there to attend the succors which Camille Colone, and John de Lunes
were to bring unto him. Strossi was determined to charge him upon the
sudden, but he retired to Seraual and Pistoye with such disorder, as it gave
occasion to many to wish that there had been a better judgment in Strossi
then he had, so fair means of hot pursuit being offered unto him, whereby
he might clean have taken away such an enemy out of Tuscane, but Strossi
said he did it to gratify the soldiers which were weary, and tired with
the long march which they had made. In the end, the Imperial army growing
stronger, and the succors out of France not being come unto him, he was feign
to quitte the field, and retire himself into Siene. In the mean time Leon
the Brother of Pierre Strossi, took certain ships of Genoway, laden with
Corn, into which having put a number of soldiers he ouerranne the coast of
Tuscane, and scouring the ports along the Fourentine Seas, after many
harms which he had made them to endure, he came and Ankered before Scarlin, a
small Town, and without renown: which while he was viewing for the skaling
of it, he dyed of an Harquebuse shot which perced his head. Whereupon his
Brother being greatly passioned, caused the siege to be continued whether
the succors of France came unto him being conducted by Monluc. Then having
united together his forces, he made up his army of six thousand Italians,
two thousand Gascons, as many Zuizers, two thousand five hundred Almanes, and
one thousand horse, as well light, as of the Ordinance, Ciuitelle besieged by
the French.
with which leaving Monluc in Siene he beesieged and battered Ciuitelle, a
little Town of the Flowrentines, which the Marquess went to defend esteeming
it a place of consequence in a fertile soil, and serving as a port and
Bulwark to the Dukes Countries. He was there so secretelye, and with such
speed, as he defeated and astonyed many of the Kings part: but Strossi
repulsed him in such a sort, as besides a great number of them were taken, and
the rest of them were slain, the guard pryor of Lomberdie and Marie de Saint
Flour, and sundry other of the Marquess side remained there captives. Strossi
in the mean time being enforced to discampe seeing that there was no
possibilitye of carrying away the place, by reason of the Marquess his
neighborhood, addressed himself to Foyanbelle, a strong and rich place,
which Carlot Vrsin held, who sent the Marquisse word, that he was able to
defend it but three days without succors. But the assault was such upon the
very first day, as Carlot and all his soldiers were put to the edge of the
sword, and the place to fire and blood. Hereupon the Marquisse being
approached, the two armies passed certain days in continualle skirmishes,
favorable sometime to the one, and sometimes to the other party. And for that
the French Artillery greatly annoyed the Imperials, who day by day yielded
themselves unto Strossi, the rest were retained by offer of a larger pay,
especially the King party if they would retire: which some did, and had been
followed by sundry other, had not Strossi playde a Counter knacke in presenting
more pay and favor then the Marquisse. But drawing toward Montpulcian, a
number of Italians abandoned him, which greatly encouraged the Marquisse to
charge him in this advantage, which the better to avoid, Strossi purposing to
retire himself by the mountains, sent his Artillery before for fear of
loosing of it, thinking thorough the favor of the mountains and ryuers
bordering about, to retarde the pursuit of the Marquisse. Who notwithstanding
pressed him so near as having stayed him between Martian, Lusignen, and Foyan
Royal Cities well beaten with the Artillery, and the Captain Bighet an
Italian, carrying Strossi his Colonel being followed by many others, Strossi
was in the end constrained to turn his back. And albeit that the Gascons and
Zuizers stood well unto it, yet their rashness in going out of their forte to
set upon the Spanniards, and Flourentines, was no less damageable, then the
cowardlinesse of those which ran away: for the Cauallerie turning head
against them, they were all cut in pieces. The Colonels of the Zuizers and
Almanes, Clermont, Monbazon, the Captains Blaise, Iean de Ville, Francois de
Record, Agapite Tody, and other to the number of three thousand, and more then
five hundred prisonners remained there, the second day of August, 1554. The
report whereof was brought unto the King before Renti, to abate the joy of
his so favorable a reencounter against the Emperor being himself in person,
thorough the sorrowful news of so pittiefull a defeat. Many which were
hurt, and sundry other, retired themselves to Sienne, there to attend such
event as the Imperialles should bring thither, Strossi and Aurele Fregose
abandoning Foyan gained Montalcin, A Captain punished for cowardly yielding up
a place furnished.
whether Bighet being come and the Earl of Elfe, who had cowardly yielded up
Lusignen a strong place, and furnished withal necessaries, they both had their
heads stricken off. The Marquisse in the mean time having taken almost all the
little places about Siene, encamped before the chief City, resolved, as he
assured the Emperor by his letters, not to depart thence, before it should
be yielded, during which siege, the Turks came into Corse, to the succor of
the French: Turks come to the aid of the French sack all the coast of Italy
especially at the siege of Caluy, and Boniface. Afterward they returned
pilling all the coast of Italy, to besiege Piombin, and and the I Will of Elbe,
which appertained to the Duke of Flourence. Passing on further they did
infinite mischeefes in the kingdom of Naples, Sicilie, and Calabria, from
whence they returned rich into Constantinople, without any man's seeking to
hinder them, so great was the reciprocal hatred beetweene these Christian
Princes, that they choose rather to ruin themselves, then agreeing them
altogether, to make war to the profit and honor of all Christendom.

Now albeit that the endeavors of the Marquisse, and the solicitations of the
Flourentine by letters, together with scarcity of victuals, were very great
occasions to move the Town to yield, yet Monluc resolved upon the point of
honor, and the Sienois for the defense of their liberty, Siene besieged by
the Imperials.
ceased not for all that to make very fair salies upon the Imperial camp.
An occasion that they battered it the more furiously, with the Artillery which
the Duke drew from the store of Florence. But the courage and resolution of the
inhabitants provided no less for the breaches and ruins, which were most
dangerous, then the paysants of the Country about for the necessity of
victualles, bringing into the Town by all means which possibly they could
invent, to refreshe their Masters withal, albeit that the rigor of the
Marquess, caused many to be hanged in their view. Herevppon Strossi hoping
somewhat of the death of Pope July, an enemy to the French, and of the
carriage of Marcel elected Pope, borne at Montalcin in Sienois, Pope Marcel
more devout then wat^er.
as I have told you, besought him to succor his Citizens, and maintain
their ancient liberty. But as new come to the estate, and more given to
Religion then to war, no other answer could be gotten of him, but Prayers
to God to have pity on their fortune. Therefore seeing that Monluc whom he
had caused to go see if he could leauie an army at Montalcin, had done
nothing for want of the money which the King had not sent unto him, in the end
they addressed themselves to the Duke of Florence. By those means the Articles
of the Sienois being rejected, the yielding of the town was in the end
accorded upon these terms,

Siene yielded by Composition.
THat the Emperor should take Siene under the protection of the holy Empire,
and maintain her in her liberties, and ancient franchises. That he should
pardon all such as had borne arms, except such as were banished, or thrust out
of Naples, or any other the territories of the Emperor, King Phillip, or the
Duke of Flourence. That he should preserve the Sienois, in their rightes,
franchises, honors, goods and dignities, as well mooueable, as immovable,
except what the soldier had already pilled. That it might be lawful for all
such as would not remain under his obedience, to depart without ransom.
That he should put in what Garrison it pleased him, without making or building
there any Citadell, except it were with the consent of the Citizens, but
rather should ruin such as were, the war being once ended. That he
should establish there such policy as he would, always the liberty and
dignity of the common wealth being preserved, and that the ancient
Maiestrates might participate in any matter of estate, and mannaging of news.
That it should be lawful for all Captains, Cheefes, Magistrates,
Governors, and soldiers of what nation soever they were, being at Siene for
the King of France to depart, their weapons and goods saved, with their
drums stricken up, and Ensigns displayed, together with their bag baggage,
train, and Artillery* to whom safe conduct should be given, and free
passage, thoroughout, until they should be arrived in their Princes
territories. And if within eight days they did not except these conditions,
that they should no more look to be received into favor.

But the end carried matter which seemed much more grievous unto them: to
wit that Siene must needs fall into the hands of the Duke of Florence. An
occasion that the Soldiers being already departed in such order as is here
above said, were followed by the most part of the Citizens, choosing rather
to loose their goods then to be subject to the Florentines whom they had in
almost an irreconciliable hatred: Montalcin the retreat of the Sienois.
in the end a great number of the best Citizens retired to Montalcin, there
erecting the body and Senate of the Sienois Seigneurie, which they named the
ancient Bailiwicke: by which they governed their estate and maintained
themselves in the same policy, which they had in the capital City. Setean
taken.
Afterward they dispersed their Garrisons to Chinsi Roset, and other Towns of
the Sienois held by the French and their practisans. In the mean time, the
Marquess having sent the Earl Marie de Saint Flour, to besiege Satean, seated
upon the Clan, Port of Hercule a road for the french Galleys surprised by the
Marquisse.
which he enforced in the end to yield to composition, went to besiege with
the rest, the port Hercule, whether the French Galleys retired themselves at
the foot of the hill Argento, not far from Orbitelle, upon the coast of the
Thirrene Seas which De Terms had to that end fortified by the Kings
commandment. Ferdinand Gonzague disapointed by the Emperor The Duke of Alua
Lieutenant general in Italy for the Emperor.

The Marquisse of Marignau malco^tent with the Duk of Alua, retyreth to his
own home


And albeit that it was resolutely defended, yet they within besieged, seeing
themselves void of any hope of succors, and all their water failing, yielded
themselves, albeit that Strossi employed all the means he was able, to leauie
men at Rome and else where, to succor the besieged, who retired to other
places, whilst that the Marquisse ouerrunning the open Country, replenished
all, with the fear of his arms. Shortly after notwithstanding, as Ferdinande
Gonzague Lieutennant general for the Emperor in Lomberdie, disapointed of his
government, retired himself mal-content to Bruscelles, to render an accounte
of his charge to the Emperor, this Marquisse likewise malcontented thorough
the Duke of Alua sent as Lieutenant for the Emperor into Italy, and making Dom
Garzie de Toledo his Lieutenant, discharging all matters without any whit of
his priuitie, quitted the army, and retired himself to his own home. Affairs
of Piemont.


To join the state of Piemont and Lombardie to the success of Tuscane, I have
given you to understand with what hap the desseins of the Marshall Brissac
stood accompanied: especially upon the surprise of Cazal, one of the most
importante places of the Country. So fortunate success, as that it was
accompanied with the dispite of the loss of Cazal and places round about. An
occasion to move the Emperor (the treaty of peace being broken of which I
told you) to send the Duke of Alua into Piemont and Italy, as his Lieutenant
general, there to reassemble his forces, and having joined unto them the
troops of the Duke of Florence and of the Marquisse of Marignan, (who
disapointed of his charge was retired as I showed unto you) to take afreshe new
advantages upon the French, and drive them clean out if it were possible. The
Marshall notwithstanding being advertised hereof, and of no hope: left of any
peace, the purparle whereof each one trained into length to hasten the premises
of the war, made a view over all his places, and provided thereunto as was
necessary, afterward he munitioned the fortes which he had reared about
Vulpian, as well to famish it, and deprive it of all succor, as for fear of
salies on his back, whilst he himself made head unto the D. of Alua, who put
himself into the field about the end of July, with twenty thousand men, as
well Spanniardes as Almanes and Italians, six thousand horse of Ordinance, and
light Cauallerie, and thirty pieces of great and small artillery. Whereupon
the Marquisse not being able to answer him in great, retired all his forces,
which from the month of June had been in the field, in number of ten thousand
Suizers, French and Almanes, with two thousand horse of all sorts, four
Cannons, and two Culuerines, about Vulpian: and fortefied himself near unto
Cazal, which he feared would be assaulted and attending such succors as he
had written unto the King would be necessary for him, he prepared himself to
all events. The Duke notwithstanding making show as though he had meant for
Cazal, took Farcinet du Pau, a small Castle three miles from thence: where
thinking to bring all under his subjection in a few months, thorough the
astonishment of a cruelty never before practiced, among such as until then
had made fair war one upon another, The first exploits of the D. of Alua
rigorous to astonish them of the country.
he caused the Captain to be hanged, the French to be put into the Galleies,
and the Italians to be cut in pieces. Afterward the Capitane La Trinite,
commanding at Valle Feniere, went out by his commandment with three hundred
horse, and four hundred footmen to discover, but being charged by certain
French Cauallerie, he was constrained to leave behind him a good part of his
company to the butcherie, to retire himself into Ast, and Alexandria. An
occasion that the D. having attempted all the places, where he might make the
first proof of his fresh army, resolved whilst his forces remained yet
entire, and that he had time and leisure, no succors being yet come out of
France, to victual Vulpian with his provisions already which he within two
days thrust, into the place, about the end of July. Vulpian victuaaled by the
D. of Alua.
Afterward he besieged Saint Iaco, whereof he supposed the fortification to
be imperfect, and the rather for that it was new would hardly endure the
Cannon. But finding it in other case then he thought for, under Boniuet
Colonel of the French fanterie, and Ludouic de Birague, accompanied with two
thousand French, Saint Iaco besieged, battered and lest by the Imperials.
and two Ensigns of the regiment of count Roquendolfe Almene, two of Italians,
and one hundred light horse of Albanoie, under Theodore Beddaine, albeit that
by the space of three weeks together he had beaten to the ground a great
part of their fortifications, without any assault, he well knew in the end by
the salies and resolute reencounters of the besieged, that it was no easy
matter, to enforce them: Iointe the coming of the Dukes D'Aumalle, D'Anguyen,
De Conde, De Neuers, De Nemours, Vidasme de Chartres, Gonor, and other followed
with ten thousand men, which the King had sent to reskew the place, animate his
partakers, and cool the enemies of his Majesty. The gnerall whereof, abating
his courrage in the very eye of the French, who united altogether put them
selves into the field to give him battle, quitted Saint Iaco, leaving the
great master of the artillery, and well fifteen hundred men dead there at the
siege, to draw to Versel, taking notwithstanding certain Castles, which he
ruined, except Gabiano, The D. of Alua retireth.
and Bourg Saint Martine, four miles from Cazal. This departure being known
by the Duke D' Aumalle, rejecting their advise which councelled him to follow
the enemy, fering the inconveniences which had at other times fallen out to
such as too violently pursued their fortune, ioynte that the whole action was
left to his discretion, he resolved to besiege Vulpian, to deliver the country
of the fear of this noisome garrison. So upon the end of August, two and
twenty thousand, as well French, as Almanes, Zuizers, and Italians, eight
hundred men at arms, and twelve hundred light horse, were encamped about it,
closing it so straightly in, as Emmanuel de La Lune, sent thither by the Duke
of Alua, to make five hundred harquebusiers on horse back, Spanish and
Italians, to enter in, had no sooner passed the Pau, vulpian besieged battered
and assaulted yields to composition.
but he was surprised and defeated by La Roche-Pozay of Poiton, who tarried
close for him, suffering very few of them to enter into the succor of the
besieged. But the place being battered without ceasing very furiously, for the
space of four and twentye days, toward the Mill, with four great
Cannons, under the assurance of the Suizers, and with five other between the
Town and the Castle by the French camp, and then on the side of the great
bulwark toward the Castle with four other, it was in such sort shaken, as
the mines trained under the great bulwark, which flanquered the town and the
Castle, being ready, and opening at the very instant of the assault, caused the
innermost part of the bulwark to fly up, where there was so large an ouerture
made, as the Spanniards and the French, having long time in throng bickered
together, shaddowed with such a darksomnes but in the end cleared, as
perceiving the besieged to be at the mercy of the assailants, they quitted all
the bulwark except such as yielded themselves. But the rest not able to enter
into the Castle, fearing least to save some the place and rest of the garrison
might be lost, were for the most part cut in pieces. Among which was a Nephew
of the Duke of Aluaes. But Sigesmond Gonzague, and the Capitane Lazare
Lieutenant of the guard to the Duke of Alua, and sundry other remained
prisoners. The other breach was better defended, for that having passed the up
diche in water to the gerdle, they were feign to clyme and grapple up with
ladders, and armors to heavy to carry. Albeit that the Prince of Anguyen, and
of Conde, were there present for example to the rest of the youth. So as many
French men remained there dead, and the Earl of Creance so sore hurt, as he
could not escape. But as soon as the general had caused four Cannons to be
placed upon the rest of the bulwark to batter the hinderpart of the breach,
and play along the streets of the town, the required parlie was accorded
and afterward concluded, that they should depart in men of war, Ensigns
displayed, drums stricken up, goods saved, and safely conducted as far as the
river of Dry near unto Train, all the munition remaining in the place* four
and twenty hours after the Capitane of the Castle yielded upon the same
conditions, saving that it was reserved unto him for his more honor and
justification to his general, that they should shoot fifty Cannon shot
against the Castle. At this accord, and yielding of the place, the Marshall was
present, about the end of September, who for many occasions refused to be at
the beginning of the siege. Afterward the place being as soon dismembered,
and unfurnished of all her fortifications, of a fair town of war there was
made a country borrough. This done, the army coasting all along the strong
places which the Imperials held upon the way of Pont d'esture (which they
thought best to take before the duke should have finished his fortifications,
being determined thereby to make head to those of Cazal, and stop the way to the
French from Cazal to Turin) skirmished with such as sailed forth of Trin and
Crescentin. Afterward the encamped at Velleneusne near Cazal, where knowing
that the garrison of Pont d'esture was lodged even to the skirts of it, to
weary the French, and in the mean time provide for the rest of the places,
Automne being already far entered, and the discommoditie of winter, they
turned to Montcaluo, which lying close by Pont d'Esture, suspected naught. The
which being taken, brideled Pont d'Esture, and the rest of the places upon the
Pan, as far as the plain of the Marquissat of Montferrat: spreading over
besides all the bounds of Cazal. Therefore the Cauallerie entertaining a hot
reprisall of skirmish upon such as salied out of Pont d'Esture, to cover the
dismarch of the fanterie and artillery, which they carried for the battery of
Montcaluo, as soon surprised as scaled thorough so sudden arrival, it caused
the Imperials to think, that they had great intelligences therein. And
immediately the approches being made with the fury of the Cannon above
twenty days together upon the great portall of the Castle which defended one
of the flankers, to break the defenses and disarme it, it was no sooner
endammaged, the mine having opened the bulwark which made the other flancke,
but they took it to composition, goods saved; the Ensign displaied, Montcaluo
taken.
with one piece of artillery, three bullets, and three shot of powder; but all
the artillery which was found there dismounted, remained, The 17. of October
the principallest of them being retired to Pont d'esture, were hanged for
yielding up so slightly without any assault, the army still remaining about
until the place was fully repaired. Afterward the winter approaching, the two
armies were dispersed into garrisons, Certain captains hanged for so slightly
yielding.
who did no great matter worthy to be marked afterward, except it were a
running at the tilte with sharp lances, between four French men, to wit, the
D. of Nemours, De Class eldest son of Vasse, the Captain Manes Rochepozay
his Lieutenant, and the Captain Moucha Ensign to Pinars against the Marquess
of Pescaire, the Marquess of Malespine, Dom Albe a Spanish Captain, Combat at
the sharp between 4. French, and as many Spaniards and Italians.
and the Earl Charaffe a Neapolitain, Nephew to the Pope: De Class and the
Captain Manes were so sore hurt in the neck, that they died within few days
after: the Earl Caraffe was pierced clean through, and died in the place, the
rest returned without any mischaunce. Moreover, as the Marshall Brissac seeing
the Winter to come on, caused his Soldiers to retire into the Towns, having
provided for the victualling and Garrison of Montcaluo, upon the retreat of
their companies to their lodginges: it happened about the twentieth of November,
that Clermontes company retyring toward Cazal, where he was appointed to
Garrison, was surprised by the Marquess of Pescaire, followed with three
hundred Harquebusiers, and eight hundred light horse, which straight put them
to flight, all their baggage remaining behind, with five and twenty or thirty
prisonners, the rest saved themselves within Casal. In revenge whereof, the
eight day of December the Captain Saluoisin being advertised, how not far
from him there were two companies of Italian light horse, departed speedily
with a good troop, marching all the night, and in the morning entered into the
village, even as the Italians were at breakfast, whom he discomfited and
utterly defeated, Surprises of certain companies in Piemont.
by the death of two of their chief Lieutenants, and well three score other,
the rest remaining prisonners in the French men's hands, who carried with them
more then three score horse, and a great quantity of armor. Thus they
disturbed one another rest in Piemont, where we will leave them, to handle
again the renewed travails of the French and Imperials in Picardie.

The Imperial army remaining only but for the favor and defense of the forces
of Giuets, and Philippe Ville against those of Mariembourg, Rocroy, and Mauber
fontaine, passed away the time of war without other fruit, auauncing the
work, notwithstanding the most that the Ligeois and Nauarrois was able better
acquainted with the nouriture and tedious aboade of the troops then all the
other, the rest of the Imperials remaining to weary the Garrisons, Desseins of
the Imperial army.
and to put the King to charge in entertaining of them, and consume the
victual of the Country, making account that Winter being come, it would be
very hard for him to recover, and more hard to put in any more, hoping thereby
to close them in and famishe them, or at the least they promised themselves
what advantage they would desire, over those that would victual them anew: an
occasion that the D. of Neuers resolved, while time served to make a general
victualling, especially at Mariembourg: but the time being consumed in Sansac
his taking of Emery Castle, who was governor of Metz in the absence of the
Marshall Vieilleuille, (which had been surprised by the Captain Beauieu of
the Imperial Garrison at Theonuille:) Joint that the Admiral was not able to
bring his men until the end of October, and likewise the great difficulty to
get wagons and cariages, which the laborers of Champagne and Retelet wearied
with their pains already passed, refused whilst that their tillage was to
do, was an occasion that they marched not until the 30. of October, that the
Admiral went to lodge at Rocroye, with the Vantgarde of five hundred men at
arms, and some companies of French, having Sansac and Bourdillon for auant
couriers with the light cauallerie, three hundred Harquebusiers on foot, and
one Regiment of men at arms to supporte them, marching all the night, to view
the woods and give their advice, notwithstanding the great raines and extreme
cold, which so benumbed the men, and especially the draught horses, that it was
impossible, for many wagons turned topsie turuie, and broken, to reach but
from Maubert fontaine to Rocroy, things not having bin made ready in their time
and season. Afterward there arrived the Duke of Neuers with twenty Ensigns
of Almanes, conducted by the Reingraue: and for that report was brought, how
the Prince of Orange tarried them in places very auantagious to stop their
passage with his Fantery, assisted with his horse men and Reisters, they caused
not the whole company to advance forward, for fear of being enclosed in,
albeit that Sansac did since assure, how the enemy had no such matter in hand:
an occasion that there entered but twenty wagons with Wine and Meal. So the
last day of October the army was divided into quarters, in the sight of the
Garrison, but so pitifully handled with cold, hail, and frostes, that many
of the Sentinels were frozen to death, one league and a half from the
Imperials, being encamped on the side of a Mountain, between Sautour and
Philippeville. But the first of November they sent out certain companies to
seize the passage, and streasse the victualers, in whose favor they sent
thither a number of companies to reskew them, and conduct them to the Camp:
and there were seen two notable chances, the one, how a Spanish double real
or twelve penny piece saved a Soldiers life, who had a Harquebuze shot but
six paces of, A notable accident.
without any harm, being notwithstanding prisonner, he was sent back again
with money in his pursse, by the Duke of Neuers, to carrye news to the camp,
how he alone was escaped of all the company: the other, a French Soldier
seeing his brother to be taken by the Imperials, laid about him so lustely
against thirty which held him, The part of a Brother.
that he brought him away sound and safe. In such and like reencounters and
skirmishes there passed 8. days in great necessity of victuals, and marvelous
discommodities of the air, before Mariembourg: until that almost all the
wagons and carriages were entered in. Then they retired themselves to the
garrisons near at hand, as also the Prince of Orange to Bruxels to the
Emperor, having sufficiently provided for Philippeuille and Charlemont.

To enter again into the estate of Almane, Ferdinande K. of Bohemia, assigned
in that time in the name of the Emperor, a diet at Ausbourg of the estates of
Almane, to accord about the point of Religion, and provide as well for the
necessities of the Empire, as the particular of each one the year 1555. The
Protestant Princes sent thither their Ambassadors, showing that they held with
the confession of Ausbourg, according to which if they would give them surety,
they would contribute to all reasonable charges. Hereupon August Duke of Saxe,
and elector by the decease of his Brother the D. Maurice (whom the Pistol shot
which he received the day of the battle against the Marquess Albert,
caused to dye, as elsewhere I have told you) and Touachin Marquess of
Brandebourg electors, the Sons of Iean Frederic, the Lantgraue, and some
other Princes neighbors about, assembled at Numbourg, upon the River Solo, and
there renewed the alliance which is hereditaire between the houses of Saxe and
Hesse. And upon that they concluded, constantly to stick to the confession of
Ausbourg. But fearing least some suspicion might grow of any new and secret
enterprise, the fifth day of their assembly, they wrote the cause thereof unto
the Emperor, insisting upon the article of the treaty of Passau, where the
peace was concluded as I have showed unto you: and protesting that in all
things they sought the repose of Almanie, they proposed the confession of
Ausbourg, exhorting every one to a general quiet, and beseeching that he
would not believe any which perhaps sought to trouble the tranquillity of the
Empire. The K. Ferdinande had proposed upon the fifth day of February, such
matters as were to be entreated of; but for that many came so slackely thither,
they began not until the 7. of March. Then the Deputies of the Princes
Electors consulted of the byls, and against the advice of many, they all
consented in the end, to begin with the point of religion. The like was
concluded in the council of the Princes and towns. After a long debate it was
agreede that they should leave religion in peace; but they differed, in that
the associates of the confession of Ausbourg, would have it to be indifferently
permitted to all kind of men to follow their doctrine, and that they might
likewise be partakers of the benefit of the peace. The other side stronglye
withstoode that, alleging that that ought not to be permitted to any Towns,
which since seven years had received the decree made at Ausbourg touching
religion, nor to any ecclesiastical person. And in case that a Bishop or Abbot
should change his religion, they would have him deprived of his place, and
another put into his room. They of the confession of Ausbourg alleged, that
the divine promises as well of the old as new Testament, in which our salvation
is contained, appertained to all men in general; by means whereof it was not
lawful for them to curtall or straighten them, for fear of shutting both
themselves and others out of the kingdom of heaven. There was neither Jew nor
Turk, were he never so little affectionate to his religion, but would wish to
draw the whole world unto it: how much more ought we to be thus encouraged,
seeing we have an express commandment from God for the fame: it must needs be
then that all remain in their liberty. Notwithstanding, to gain peace, they
permitted unto them that they should keep their fashions and ceremonies, use
and enjoy all their goods, possessions, customs, rightes and privileges,
until the different of religion should be determined. But they would not allow
the same condition to be prescribed unto Bishops, for thereby it might grow
that they should be bound to make war against their allies of the same
religion, and with great dishonor condemn their own cause, for it were as
much as to confess, said they, that our doctrine and religion were not worthy
of ecclesiastical goods, and that until this day such goods had been unjustly
bestowed upon our Churches and Ministers. Moreover, we should confess the
Papists doctrine to be holy, and their ministerye grounded upon the word of
God, and that their goods were justly devoted to their order, life, statutes,
and ceremonies: and what a scandal would it grow, if we should defend their
cause and goods, which serve to no end in the Church, and contrariwise we
should betray them whom we ought to hold in singular recommendation, by
reason of the same religion. The Catholics alleged other reasons, that if
it should be lawful for ecclesiastical persons to change religion, within a
while Bishops, and like chapitres would be profaned, and being cut of from the
Churches, would fall into the Princes hands, and so remain unto them as an
heritage: to which they answered that there was never any such matter meant,
but that their intent was to reduce things to their first institution, and
appropriate them to their true vsages, annexing the goods for ever unto the
Churches; and to take away all doubt, they promised to give caution that no
goods of Bishops or chaptres should be aliened, in case their religion should
be changed; provided that after the decease or resignation of the Bishop or
superior, the election and administration should be left free to them of the
College. Now after many differents of the one part, and other as well by
wrighting as by speech, there was in the end agreede and enacted, the five and
twentieth of September, and read in publicque audience, according to the
custom, such decree as follows: the which being well observed, has
maintained the Empire and the Almanes in good peace, until this present.

The decree of Ausbourg.
THat Emperor; the K. Ferdinande, and the rest of the Princes and estates,
should do no wrong to any of the Empire, in case whatsoever: in respect of the
doctrine of the confession of Ausbourg, concerning the point of Religion and
faith received: nor hereafter compel by their commandments or other means,
those which were confederate in the said confession, to abandon their
religion, ceremonies and laws, instituted by them within their territories; or
to be instituted hereafter: especially that they have not their religion in
contempt, but leave them free with their goods, enheritances, customs,
possessions, and all other rightes: so as they may peaceably hold them. That
the different of religion be no otherwise determined, but by holy, amiable,
and peaceable means. They of the confession of Ausbourg, shall in like sort
behave themselves toward the Emperor, the K. Ferdinande, and the rest of the
Princes and estates, addicted to the ancient religion, whether Ecclesiastical
or Temporal; and toward all other of the Church, and toward their colleagues
into what part soever they shall retire to inhabit: provided that they acquit
themselves of their ministry as hereafter shall be declared. To all these
they shall permit in liberty, their religion and ceremonies their laws,
possessions, tributes and other rights, and no man shall hinder their enjoying
of the same. That if any suites or process shall fall but, they shall be
determined both of the one side and the other, according to the customs and
laws of the Empire. They which are neither of the one nor the other religion,
are not to be comprehended within this peace. If any Archb. Bishop, Prelate, or
other ecclesiastical person do renounce the ancient religion, that he quit
his Byshopricke, Prelature Benefice and together there with all the fruits*
which he has received: which notwithstanding shall not any ways turn to his
dishonor or infamy, But the chapitre or they to whom it appertains by
custom or right shall have power to substitute another in his room, so as he
be of the ancient Religion. To the end that the rightes of institutions,
election, presentation, may remain with the entire possession of their goods,
upon conditon notwithstanding that in any respect thereof any future accord
of religion whereof it has been spoken, be not any ways impaired. And for so
much as certain estates of the Empire, and their ancetours, have usurped
certain prouostships, monasteries, and like goods, appertaining to the Church,
which they have appropriated to their ecclesiastical ministeries. Schools,
and other holy uses: that by no means they be disquieted for that, nor called
into any court of justice, but that all such goods shall remain in their
order: to wit, all such as did not appertain to the estates of the Empire, or
to any other Subject to the Empire, whereof the Clergy were not in possession
at the time of the transaction of Passau, nor after. And that it be not
permitted to the Judges of the Chamber, to proceed by law, or co^mence any
suits against them, or decide any thing, by reason of any such goods so usurped
or aliened. That the ecclesiastical jurisdiction be not exercised, nor take
place against the Leaguers in the confession of Ausbourg, against their
religion, faith, ceremonies, laws by ecclesiastical ministeries, but that she
have therein her hands bound, not doing unto them any disturbance, until that
the different should be apeased. In other matters not appertaining to their
Religion, ceremonies, laws, and ministeries, that they carry themselves
according to the ancient right, and custom of the Country. Further that all
Ecclesiastical persons enjoy their goods entirely, their revenues and other
rights: provided notwithstanding that they in whose seigneurie such goods are,
loose nothing of such politic right as they had before the discord of
Religion. Moreover that out of such goods they ordain and maintain, as
heretofore it has already been established, the necessary ministeries,
Parishes, Schools, Alms houses and Hospitals for the poor afflicted, without
any regard of what Religion they be, for whose use succor, and nourishment
they be ordained. If for this nourishment, and quantity thereof, there should
arise any strife or debate, then arbitrators shall be chosen by the consent of
the parties, who after inquiry made thereof, shall determine within six
months, how much should be sequestered to the use of such ministeries. During
the hanging of which process, they to whom it does appertain to give aid,
and contribute to such vsances, shall not be disturbed in their possession,
but only shall contribute as they were wont in old time, until the success
shall be determined.

Now if the Almanes were willing by these means to maintain themselves in
peace, the French Chatholiques seemed to be more and more animated toward the
research and curious pursuit of such as they termed reformed.

The K. of France, stirred up by his favorites, had made an Edict, by which it
was commanded to all Judges, to punish without delay according to the exigence
of the case, such as should be condemned by the Ecclesiastical Judges and
inquisitors of the faith, without any ways deferring upon any appeals.
Afterward it was sent to the Parliament of Paris, to the end it should be
there read, and published, and after publication enregistred in the Grefferie,
and proclaimed according to the custom. They of the Court finding it strange,
that the succor, and last refuge to the miserable, should be denied to the
condemned, demanded a time of advice, and afterward on the six and twenty
day of October, 1555. they sent deputies of their body unto the King, to
inform him of their opinion, and take in good part the remonstrances which
follow, the which they sent unto him at such time as the Cardinals of Lorraine
and of Turnon were gone to Rome.

By your own Edict (Sire) four years since, you have reserved to your self
and your Judges the entire connoissance and punishment of the Lutherane
heresy, without any exception, saving that heresy required some declaration,
ere that sentence should be given upon those that had received holy orders. In
present the Edict whereof the question grows, ordains mearely the
contrary: for it subiecteth the people to the judgment of the Ecclesiastical
persons, and of the inquisitors. In which they diminish your dignity wherein
you surpass all other Princes; and give just occasion to the people to grieve,
to see themselves abandoned from you, and made subject to the power of another.
But yet the displeasure much more abounds, when without the succor of
appeal, all their goods, their life and their honor, shall be in the power of
the said Ecclesiastical persons. For without doubt appeal is the refuge and
safegarde of innocence: you are the tutor and protector, as well of the
appeal, as of the innocents and so is there none but you which has power over
the people. Now if authority be given to the inquisitors and officers of
Bishops, Appeal of the last refuge of the condemned* and safegarde of
innocence.
to judge without appeal, it shall be as much as to open a window, and beat
a path, for to condemn the innocent, and make them to loose both body and
goods. Iointe, that the judges of Churches seeing themselves in such authority
and Royal credit, will forget their duty, and not keep within their bounds,
seeing all estates subject unto them, and managing them at their own post, will
not only leave to regard the vulgar sort, but will carry no respect at all to
Princes. It lies for all that in you, if it please you thus to meditate these
matters. To wit that your Judges take cognoissance of the causes, and therein
give sentence, and if there be found any doubtful Article or opinion, that
then Ecclesiastical persons may give resolution. Likewise that such as have
received orders be judged by their Judges. As touching appeals, that
commission may be obtained at the Popes hands, whereby it may be permitted
unto the subjects, and in case it shall fall out, that sentence must be given
of such as shall be appelants, that therein they take some of your
Ecclesiastical Counselors, such as shall be chosen, or for default of them
some other notable and sufficient personages. In regard of the inquisition that
it be observed, to have the Popes inquisitor deputed under him thoroughout all
provinces, to be men of good renown and of entire life. And that the Bishop be
at the charge, and not the accused, upon condition notwithstanding that the
process being ended, the charges be recovered of those to whom it
appertains. These things are proper to bound in and enclose such process
within certain limits. Moreover for that it appears that by the punishments
of Heretics, how necessary soever they be, they have not amended them until
this present, but only it has been showed thereby how detestable the thing
is, and further for that it is far better to prevent a sickness, then to
give it leisure to grow, and afterward apply a remedy, you must herein (most
gracious Prince) follow the customs and paths of the primitive and ancient
Church: for she was not established either by sword or fire, but the diligence
of Bishops has always resisted against Heretics; because that they
always insisted to preach the word of God, and show good example in their
life. Considering then how the Church was by this means confirmed, there is no
doubt but she would still be able to maintain and countergarde her self, if
you would therein use your power, causing Bishops and Pastors in their own
persons to govern their Churches, and likewise all inferior ministers. That
they live holily, and teach the word of God or cause it to be taught by persons
sit. And that hereafter the charge of Churches be not given but to men able of
themselves to teach, without substituting Vicars in their rooms. This is the
root, whereunto the hand must be put, this is the foundation upon which the
building must be framed: for by this means there is hope that heresies will by
little and little vanish away. But if no account be made of following this
course, there is danger that heresies will increase more and more, what Edict
soever can be made or remedies used to the contrary.

In sum, few of the Lords of the privy Council remaining there, which
would any ways contrary the same, the Edict which I will speak of else
where, was engrossed, in the end concluded, and after published thoroughout the
whole Realm, to the contentment of some, and displeasure of many other.

Charles 5. Emperor yields up all his estates and retireth into Spain to
live privately.
In this same time Charles of Austria, Emperor of the Romans, tired with the
enterprise of humane actions, no less then pressed with his particular
inconveniences, resolved to put end thereunto. So that as well to appease the
violence of his Goutes, feeblenes of stomach, megromes, headache, and an
infinite of other diseases which day by day diminished his natural strength,
as to see the inconstancy of mundane accidents and small assurance in the
fairest desseins of man, good fortune the compagnion of many his actions
having been often times enterlaced by the encounter of some Signal desastre.
Iointe the presages of Vesalins his Physician, and other upon the brevity of
his days, he determined to exchange a public life, until then reasonable
well governed, with a particular and solitary, which rather carried a
Religious devotion, then any mundane managing. Therefore having from the month
of September caused his son Phillip King of England, to come unto him, to
whom for six weakes together, he communicated his most important affairs,
and the means which he ought to hold in the government of his estates, he
caused the general estates of all his low Countries to be assembled at
Bruxelles, where he declared the indisposition of his person, the good they
had received from himself, and the favor which they might receive from his
son whom as then rising out of his chair, and kneeling barehead before and
over against the Emperor, putting his hand upon his head, he invested in all
his patrimoniall goods, and having recommended unto him Religion and Justice,
he gave him his blessing. Then the Prince risen up, and due reverence made unto
his Father, and Queen Mary his Aunt, in the end turning unto the people,
thanked God for his present advantages, besought him to assist him in all his
actions to come, rendered thanks unto the Emperor for the care he had of his
person from his first age until that day, and unto the people for the
acceptaunce they had made of him, assuring them of so good a government, as
they should not have cause to repent themselves of this hap and consent.
Afterward Queen Marye dowager of Hungary, Mary Q of Hungary Gouernesse of
the Low Countries.
Gouernesse of the Low countries seeing the tears trickle down the graye
bearde of the Emperor, his pale and earthly face, rose up to declare unto the
people, that for thirteen years together, while her charge endured which she
had received from the Ceasareal, and she had employed all the means which God
had lent unto her, to acquitte her self of her duty, that if any fault
happened, it was unwitting, and not of any her malice, for which she besought
all them to pardon her, assuring her self that her brother the Emperor rested
content. This done, the Emperor publicly acquitted all his Subjects, of
their oaths made unto him, and rising out of his Throane, caused his Son to
sit therein, who presently received the homages and oaths of all his
Vassalles. Grace and sweetness the first actions of Princes.
Afterward all the first Seals of Charles were broken in pieces, and in
their place King Philips were brought, wherewith there were presentlye sealed
certain pardons and other dispatches. Thus did he disseaze himself of all
his goods and estates, to lead a peaceable life in a house of pleasure, which
he had builded in Castilia, called Just, reserving only to himself the
vsufruite of Castilia, and the superintendaunce of all the commaundaries.
Afterward, by his gracious Letters to the Electours and Princes of Germany,
he besought them to reconcile themselves together, unfolding unto them the
small occasion which they had to quarrel one with another, aduertising them of
his purpose to pass into Spain, and how he had resigned the Empire into
their hands, counselling and beseeching them to choose his brother the King of
the Romans, whom they knew to be of desarte and age. Fearing least if some
young Emperor should be chosen, he would increase the wars among the
Christians, (a fit onuerture to the Turks to empayre Christendom)
especially upon his nearest neighbors.

In the end, he recommended unto them his Son, beseeching them, that if
ever he had done any matter of worth for them and their Country, they would
acknowledge it in the behalf of his Son, who being charged with great
affairs, had need of his friends assistaunce. At the least, that they would
not be contrary unto him, though some particularities might turn them from
ayding of him. He sent likewise S^uler a doctor to his brother Ferdinando, to
yield over unto him on his part all the charges of the Empire, beseeching him
to reconcile the Princes one to another, in which the stay and increase of the
Empire wholly consisted, the true and nearest cause of the ruin thereof
proceeding from division. Then that he would yield all aid to his Son
Philip, as a neighbor to such an enemy as the King of France was. In the
end, being determined to depart, he was stayed thourough the vyolence of
his diseases, contratyeties of winds, long stay in the preparation of his
Ships, and thourough a difference fallen out in some of the towns, which
would by no means receive his son, the father living, and other which would
have his nephewe Ferdinande second son to the King of Romans for their
governor. Joint the male contentment of a number of Lords, and other, who
having employed all their means, and often times their life in his service,
under a hope of great recompense, saw themselves by this his dimission; and
departure into Spain, frustrated of all their hope, which they could not hope
for at his sons hands, who as ordinarily new Kings affecte new
servants, would employe his means but to the advancement of his
favorites, or in recompencing their pains and service toward him, of whom
himself had been an eye witness.

About the end of November, Ferdinande King of Romans, having assembled
together the greatest part of his men of war, went down the Danube as
far as Vienne, to make head against the Turk, who made great preparation for
his descente into Hungary, to besiege again Vienne in Austria as I will show
you.

To open unto you the affairs and chaunges of the Realm of England in few
words: Henry the eyghte, discontented in that he had no other heir but Mary
borne of Katherine, aunte unto the Emperor, whom his brother Arthur had
married at the age of fourteen years, and left her a Virgin, by the advice
of the Cardinal of York, and many dyuines as well French, as Almaines and
English, divorced her, and having in full assembly declared his daughter Marye
illegitimate, married Anne Bullen, one of his wifes maids: the which Pope
Clemente the seventh so hardly could digest, as that he condemned this
divorce, as unjust, and of evil example, especially for that Anne was a
Lutherane, and he feared least the King and all his Realm would confourme
them selves to the like religion. Whereat Henrye took such disdain, as he
declared himself head of the Church thorough out all England, with forbidding
any to aduowe the Pope for head, or to transporte any money to Rome, or pay
Peterpence, a reuennewe which every house yearly paid according to the
ordinance of Inas in the year seven hundred and forty: Whereupon there
ensued a great alteration of Religion thorough out the whole Realm, so
confirmed by Edward his son, as that the catholic was clean banished out
of England, at the least in public, which caused many English men to fly
the Realm, to seek in some other Country a place of more free conscience.
Seeing that the Dukes of Sommerset and Northumberlande governed the roaste in
the year 1553. Notwithstanding as after the death of the Duke of Sommerset,
the Duke of Northumberlande (seeing how the King was fallen sick of a Flux,
which fell into his stomache from the month of February) had married his
son Guilforde to ^an^ daughter to the Duke of Suffolk, and cousin unto the
sick King, he wrought so much, as that the young King rejecting his sisters
Marye and Elizabeth, declared for his heir, and Inherittice unto the Crown of
England, this Jane of Suffolk, to the end that by this means he might
traunsferre the Royalle into his own House, and disinherite the true Heirs of
their right, and legitimate Succession. This Marriage and Testamentarie
declaration being done in the month of May gave occasion to a number, to
think that this young King, whom they held for the pillar of men of
knowledge, and gave great hope of future virtue, was poisoned, and that being
assured of the time of his death, they had caused him to do whatsoever they
would have him: well, were it of poison or of a Caterre, so it is, that
Edward the sixte of that name, and the one and forty K. of England, dyed the
sixth day of July, the seventh year of his Reign, and the sixteenth of his
age, solemly entered at Westminster, not without the tears of his subjects,
who said that his death was presaged by a Comet which appeared a little before
his departure, and by the great storms, winds, tempests, and thunders, which
had that year tormented London the chief City of the Realm, as the
witnesses of such troubles as shortly after ensued in England: for the people
hating in secret this Duke of Northumberland, held for suspected the testament
of King Edward, as a thing made too much to the advantage of the Duke and many
Lords of the Country, terming him too ambitious, wrote unto Mary the eldest
daughter of K. Henry the eight, encouraging her to declare her self Queen,
and offering unto her all duty and service. Marye who had no great means,
durst not so soon come to London, to the end that according to the custom,
she might remain ten days in the Tower before her Coronation, but went into
the Country and Dukedom of Norfolk, bordering on the Sea coast: from whence
she wrote to sundry Princes and Lords of the Country, complaining how that
Jane of Suffolk, had enterprised against her, and that Edward was not able to
dispose of the Crown which appertained unto her, Letters and plaints of Mary
aspiring the Crown of England.
being the next daughter unto the late King Henry: she laid before them the
wrong which had been done unto Katherine her mother, and next unto her self,
and that none of King Henry his children were to succeed before her:
protesting that she would pursue her right by the sword, and not suffer the
Duke of Northumberland to vaunt how he would dispose at his pleasure of the
Realm of England. These letters being brought to London at the self same time
as Jane of Suffolk against her will, was proclaimed Queen within the Tower of
London, caused a great change of dispositions among the Lords there present
and a strange alienating of their minds touching the case of Jane, whom
sundry from thence forth left to take Mary's part. The which caused the Duke
of Northumberland to send certain troops of men at arms, into the Country
of Norfolk, thinking thereby to hinder her desseins. But in the mean time
she was proclaimed Queen in Suffolk by the principal personages of the
land. So as having recovered some succors from the Emperor on the coast of
Flaunders, (albeit that the Duke had strongly armed upon the Seas to hinder
their coming) she practiced with a number of the chief of the Duke his
army, which in the end incorporated themselves to hers. In the mean time
Northumberland, to play on the surer side, would needs have the Duke of
Suffolk Father to Jane, to go as her Lieutennant general against Marye: for
he durst not leave London, fearing least the Londiners would reuoulte: But
the Duke of Suffolk refusing to take this charge upon him, he was constrained
to go him self the other remaining to serve to give counsel to his daughter
within the Tower of London. The mishappe notwithstanding of this poor Lord was
such, as of a great number of men which he had in his train, he saw himself
as it were even in a moment left clean destitute of them all. And as one
mishappe never comes alone, having for want of men sent to London for
soldiers from thence to come to his succors, and for some Lords which might
serve for hostages and warrant of his life they were no sooner without the
City, but they declared themselves for Marye. Whereof it ensued that the
Duke, who hoped to see his Son King of England, saw himself left of every
manne, and delivered into the hands of Marye his enemy, afterward conveyed
to London, where his trial being made, he then was condemned to loose his
head, the judgment being executed in the month of September, and Marie being
proclaimed Queen at London by the Lords and cou^cellors of the whole Realm of
England, as the lawful heir apparent thereunto: and in the end the miserable
princess Jane of Suffolk, with her husband son unto the D. of
Northumberland, had their heads stricken off at London, for that she would not
release (as some said) the right which she pretended to the Crown. Thus
ceased the trouble on that side within the Realm of England.

Marie being thus received for Queen in England, they propounded unto her
certain points to effectuate: as to reestablish the ancient Chatholique
Religion, and the goods of the Church into their former estate, then that it
would please her to marie with some Prince worthy of her and her Realm,
thereby to draw a succor unto the Crown. Whereupon to the end that better and
more ready order might be given unto the first, she was counceled to send for
her coussen Raynolde Pole then a Fugitive at Rome for Religion, who coming as
Legate, and with full power from the Pope, might better advance such a matter
then any other within the Realm, Pole being sent for, and forward on his way
with such authority as was required, was entreated by the Emperor Charles the
fifth to visit him as he passed by at Bruxelles: where he so cunningly handled
any Englishman, as he promised him that he would further the marriage between
his Cossin the Queen of England, and his son Philippe Prince of Spain,
which took such effect as you have seen touching the second point which
could not be so soon brought to pass. The Legate being received with great
devotion and magnificence into his Country, was in full assembly of the three
estates of the Realm, begone the 12. of November 1554. restored unto all his
dignities, goods and honors, whereof he had been deprived by K. Henry the
eight. Afterward upon Wensday the twenty eight of that month, the Parliament
of England being assembled, and in the presence of the King and Queen, he
exposed his Legation, and exhorted them to return to the holy Sea of the Pope,
delivering unto them, how greatly bound they were unto almighty God, who now
had enlarged toward them his divine grace, having bestowed upon them two such
Princes as they had, further he showed unto them how the holy Father meant to
use his benignity and accustomed clemencye, by him his Legate: greatly
thanking them for that they had received him into his Country, and restored
him in blood, where in he had been so long attaint: and how in respect
thereof he held himself the more bound to procure that they might be
restored into the heavenly Court, as his principal desire was. That done he
retired, to give the better commodity unto the Lords of the Parliament to
resolve themselves. And straight ways the Chancellor repeating the words of
the Cardinal, showed unto them how much they were to thank God, who had
raised up such a Prophet of their own seed to procure their salvation. In
such wise as al with a common accord concluded to consent to the union and
obedience of the Church of Rome. So as on the next morrow it was ordained, that
the Cardinals motion should be accorded, and to present with a common consent,
a petition to beseech their Majesty's, as the head of the realm to entreat
the Legate to procure an absolute remission of all their errors passed:
Promising to repeal all the laws, which had been in former times established
against the authority of the Sea of Rome. The King sent the petition to the
Legate, and the day after the Parliament reassembled in the place where the
King and Queen with the Cardinal were set. There the Chancellor rose up,
and with such great reverence delivered alowde the resolution which had been
made by the Lords of the Parliament, beseeching in the name of them all, that
their petition might be accepted, which was written in Latin, formed and
sealed by the Chancelour. The petition being opened by the Legate, was
delivered unto the Chancelour to publish, who read it with a loud voice, and
that done, put it to the question, which they all passed, and upon that the
King and Queen arose, and presented the petition unto the Legate who read the
same. Afterward he gave unto them the Bulls of his Legation to read, where by
might appear the authority which he had from the holy Father to be able to
absolve them: that done, he made unto the man Oration in English, showing how
much repentance was agreeable unto God, and how the Angels in Paradise make
more joy of a sinner which returns to repentance, then of nintie and nine
just. And thereupon applied certain examples out of the word to his purpose.
Then having ended his speech he arose up, and the King and Queen kneeled down
on both knees before him, inuoking God and the Saints, that it would please
him, to pardon the penitent people, in the authority of him whose person he
there represented, all the faults which they had committed in times passed;
that done the Legate pronounced a general absolution. Afterward they all
followed the King, Queen and Legate to the Chapel, where was song Te Deum.
And after that the Cardinal had made his triumphant entries, he restored on
the first Sunday in Aduent to the Bishops, and other Ecclesiastical persons,
all the power, authority and prerogative, which had been taken from them. On
which day, the Bishop of Winchester having been before times of the
Protestant Religion, made a Sermon, after a solemn Mass, taking for his
theme, Nunc tempus est de somno surgere, that is to say, it is now time to
awake out of sleep, as if he would say that under the Reign of Edward King
of England he had always been asleep. The Queen had in the beginning sent
Ambassadors to Rome, with commission to kiss the feet of his holiness, and
to present unto him the duty of a Chatholike Queen, and an obedient daughter
of the holy and Apostolic Church of Rome, which she acknowledged for the
head, Matrice and Sovereign of all the Churches of Christendom, and mother of
all the Princes making profession of the Gospel. Which was so agreeable unto
the Pope, and the whole Court and people of Rome, that for a public
testimony thereof they made Bonfiers, and solemn processions praising God for
this conversion. Afterward, and in the year 1555. an other Parliament was
summoned in England, in which among other things Queen Marie, wrought by all
the means she was able, that the Abbie lands might be restored, for so much
as the Pope did urge it very hard. But by reason that the Nobility and
Gentlemen stood seized thereof, and that many had gifts thereof from the
King, nothing could be brought to pass as she desired. Notwithstanding the
Queen prevailed so much, as the tenthes were granted to the Clergy: during
this assembly they scattered and sowed about London little pamphlets very
biting, among which some were sufficiently enough able to move the people to
sedition against the Spanniardes, Libels against the Spanniardes in England.
(with whom the Englishmen playde a thousand shrewd turns) and to turn the
Queen from the love of Phillip: Great search was made, but it never could be
possibly known whence they proceeded. Before this assembly was dissolved and
matters dispatched, the B. of Winchester being Chancelour dyed of a Dropsy;
Thomas Heath Archbishop of York, who before that, had been in Germany with
him of Caunterburie, and professed the Protestant Religion, succeeded in his
place.

An accord beetweene the King and the Duke of Estampes, for his clame to the
Duchy of Bretaigne
After the victualing of Mariembourg, and the attempts of Deux Ginets, the King
being informed of the ancient clames of the houses of Blois and Mont-forte to
the Duchy of Bretaigne, to appease with the self same hand the quarrels
which were redoubled, by the Lady Anne Queen of France, and Duchess of
Bretaigne, issued out of the blood of Mon-fort, in whose right the King
himself claimed, to accord this old difference with Messire Iean de Brosse,
Duke of estampes, and Earl of Ponticue, heir of the house of Blois rightes,
he accorded in such sort, as this Duke released unto him, for himself and
his successors Kings of France, all rightes, titles, reasons, and actions,
which he pretended to the Duchy of Bretaigne, in right of his mother the
Lady Marle of Bretaigne issued out of the house of Blois, and the King clean
acquitted and transferred unto him the County of Pontieure, saving certain
Ports between Couegnon, and Hauegnon, and the Seicheries of Cornoaille.
Whereof autenticall letters passed between them.

The History of France.
THE FOVRTH BOOK.
THe narration of matters passed has made you able to know no less the desire
the^ the necessity which the French had of a general peace, under the
benefit whereof they hoped to forget all, at the least, part of so many losses
passed, and of the present miseries, which caused them to fear much more
mischief to ensue: you have seen how stout these Princes showed themselves
upon their treaties, by the aduantagious conditions which their Ambassadors
had charge from them to repose. In the end notwithstanding, yielding unto the advice of their Council, they thought good to renew again the negotiation.
Iointe the fear which the Imperials had of the coming of the Turks, Occasions
which moved K. Philip and Marie of England to harken to a peace.
and the desire of Marie Queen of England to have her husband still about her,
hoping there by to get an inheritor unto her Crown, to restore the Catholic
Church into her Country, not to enter league with any one to war against
another, to ease her Realm of so great charges, and not to breed any
occasions of new riots and mutinies amongst her people: Of all which points
she clean lost the hope, if her husband should be absent, employing in the
managing and conduct of war. Besides the peaceable nature of this Prince,
which made great accounte of the good Council which his Father gave him, to
procure a reconciliation with all Princes round about him, were sufficient
occasions to move him instantly to request the Cardinal Pole to renew again
the terms of peace: or at the least to conclude a good truce, for a release
to so great mischiefs. Whereupon seeing the difficulty of articulating the
conditions with such advantages as each one desired, the truce was concluded
for five years, the fifth day of February, 1556. ceasing al quarrels, and
beginning again to enter traficque, and Merchandise one with an other, as well
by Sea, as land, every man retaining what they had gotten and taken by right of
war, without being able to agree upon their prisonners, (among whom the D.
of Ascot a Flemming, and Francis de Montmorency, eldest son unto the
Constable were the principal) with many other conditions, which were
proclaimed at Paris the sixteen day of February. And afterward the Comte de
Lallain was at Blois in April to confirm the same with the King, as also the
Admiral De Chastillon was at Bruxelles with the Emperor and King Philip, to
receive there the oath of their part: wherein it was not forgotten to motion a
marriage, between Don Carlo eldest son unto Philip, and Prince of Spain,
with the Lady Isabel eldest daughter unto the King. But if France and the
provinces which co^fined on the Septentrional side, hoped for repose during the
continuance of this truce, new occasions of more fresh mischiefs presented
themselves on the other side especially toward Italy.

You have seen the election of the Cardinal Theatin to the Papacy: and for
that the house of Caraffe, out of which he was descended, and of Melphe, being
of the most special mark within the Realm of Naples, have always remained
devoted unto the Crown of France, which ever honorably entertained them, the
Colonois, Vrsins, and other families of Rome partakers of the Emperor, fearing
to be made stoop, and least the Pope would too much exalt the friends of the
French, whom he might call into Italy, (for that the Church of Rome pretends
the Realm of Naples to be of her proper Domanie) and least, together with the
graunts made unto the Kings of France, confirmed by the Popes predecessors, and
other matters which the King there demanded, he should make a new
ratification, with intent to be able to prevail, held themselves in the
beginning upon their gards, then as the fearful man interprets, all newter
things, simple and doubtful to his disadvantage, they suspected in such wise
the actions of the Pope and his confederates, as they well furnished with men,
armor, and other munition such lodgings as they had within the Town. Whereof
the Pope being advertised, and as soon animated against them, he leauied men:
and by a general muster took away arms from those whom he thought had too
much: he munitioned the places within Rome, and well furnished the Castle of
Saint Angelo with all necessaries. Afterward, as a man licenseth himself
accordingly, as leisure and liberty is given unto him, he seized upon the
strongest places which were about Rome, into which he put Garrisons. And at the
same instance caused to be imprisoned or assigned a brefe day, to the authors
of their commotion, among the rest the Cardinal S. Fleur, Camille Collone,
Julian Cesarin, and Ascaigne de la Corn. All which stomacking, that they were
so strangely handled, fled unto the Emperor and his son, vowing themselves
vassals unto them, where by they might find succor, causing them so much to
mislike the form, wherewith the Pope had proceeded, and to doubt in such sort
the desseins of the French party in Italy, as they sent straight to the Dukes
of Alua and Flourence, to assemble all their forces, and having joined them
together with such new as they appointed unto them, so to shut up the Pope and
his adherents, that no means should be left unto them, but bare words, to
express the repentance of such an attempt: which they performed in a very
short space, having by the means and conduct of the Colonois among other,
regained from the Pope many fortresses, whereof they rendered some to these
complainants. Afterward building many forts about Rome, near Ostia, upon the
bank and course of Tiber, they put the Pope in such a straight within the
Castle of Saint Angelo, Rome in such necessity, and her supports so bare of
means, as they were constrained to demand succor of the King of France, as
of the first son of the Church, sending unto him by the Cardinal Caraffe,
nephew unto Pope Paul 4. his Legate, a Hat after the fashion of the ancient
Roman Senators, and a Sword, signifying the defense of the Church, and
Apostolic Sea. Who being come to Fontainbleau about the end of June, delivered
the presents unto the King whom he summoned, and abiured to succor the head
of the Christian Religion, according unto the title of most Christian, which
was given unto him thourough the endeavor of his predecessors, who had many
times restored the Popes into their seats, against tyrants, paganes, and
other: especially as his late father in fresh memory did touching Pope Clement
besieged within Rome, afterward in the Castle of S. Angelo, by the troops of
Charles of Bourbon, and Prince of Or^nge, successively generals over the
Imperial army. To whom having answered that he would take counsel upon it,
he put him notwithstanding in a good hope, assuring him that he would fail no
whit in the virtuous deportments of his ancestors, and would succor the holy
Father with all his might, in any reasonable sort. Afterward notwithstanding
having given advice to the Emperor and his son, endeavoring to meditate the
whole rather by persuasions, then to come to action, contrary to the
covenants, so solemnly sworn of each part, for the repose of all the
Christian Churches. According to which at a feast which the King made at
Fontaine-bleau, he caused before supper all the Ambassadors to retire into the
Chapel, in the presence of whom he told the Emperors to this effect. That
his master was not able to excuse himself, but that the war which the
Seigneur Marc Anthoine Colone made against the Pope, was maintained, and
conducted at his expenses and provisions. Moreover this Cardinal had been not
long before seen in France a man of war at the Kings service, and was so
favorably entertained, that he was soon laden with presents. Now for that
there was no Bishoppricke void at that time, Bertrande the Lord Keeper of the
great Seal, being requested by the King lent unto him his Bishoppricke of
Cominges, which he bestowed upon the Cardinal Caraffe: and afterward
Bertrande was made Cardinal of Sens. Charles Cardinal of Lorraine, Charles
Cardinal of Lorraine and his vyage in into Italy,
being returned a little before from Rome, (having been sent thither to
congratulate the election of the Pope, confirm the amity of the French, and
if it were possible to draw him in League against the Emperor, and who with
great capitulations had made Hercules the second Duke of Ferrare, the Kings
Lieutenant generally in Italy) seemed to favor the desseine of the Pope.

In such an occurrence the King wanted no advise, and that very diverse: they
which councelled him to break the truce, laid before him the immortal honor
which he should obtain to defend, yea and to free out of such a servitude the
great Pontife the holy Father, and the universal head of all the Christians in
the world; which he was tied the rather to do, for that he seemed pricked
forwards thereunto, by a general emulation of so many Kings his ancestors,
who to retire him out of his enemies hands, and to carry themselves as the
true pillar of the Christian building, have attained and preserved as it were
from hand to hand, that fair and so honorable title of Most Christian, and
eldest son of the Catholic Church. They likewise set before him the
incredible profit, which he should make in the conquest of that goodly Realm
of Naples, which being withdrawn from the Crown of France, by the ingenious
malice of the Castilians, and Aragonois, stood so smally assured between
their hands, that with the great authority which the Pope had thoroughout all
Italy, and the particular means of his own house within that Realm, together
with the favors of so many Princes, who desired nothing more, then to see
again the Flower de Luce better founded there then heretofore, there was no
doubt but that the army which he might send thither, would carry it away even
at their first aboorde, considering the coffeehouse which the Italians
carried against the Spanniards, who mastred them with all kind of Rigor: and
considering the small forces which were there, and the retreat of the Emperor
Charles the fifth: who not to confound himself in the vanities of this world,
had quitted all his goods, and estates thereby to live private, Persuasions to
perjury.
and out of all managing of human affairs. And to remove from him any
opinion of dishonor, which they would imprint unto him, that diswaded him from
breaking of his faith, given to the observing of this truce, they declared unto
him that the accident since happened unto his holiness, caused so much more all
occasions to vanish, which might move him to keep his word, as the Pope is
above all the persons of the world. And as the Son could not be thought to
do his duty, if he did not rush upon his kinsman or allie, what friendship
soever were sworn between them, which went about to endamage his Father. So
the malicious ambition of Charles, and Philip of Austria, who hold the Pope
prisonner, to enforce him to do their will, to the servitude of all Italy,
whence they determined to chase out the credit of the French, was sufficient
cause enough for him, to declare himself protector of the holy Sea against
all violence. All good conuentions are lawful and to be kept, but the Pope
Christ's Vicar is above all, is always and in all things excepted, as every
Sovereign is in a reciprocal oath made among his subjects: for they cannot
prejudice the rights of their Prince, much less then Christians the right of
the Pope, especially in a case of such importance. Iointe that Truces do not
forbid war, but in Countries of obedience, not in other places where they have
naught to do. Moreover they do not hinder one from taking upon him the defense
of some friend or allie, by a much more strong reason then of him, to whom all
Christians are redewable for what soever they have in this world, as to Gods
Lieutennant on earth.

Anne de Montmorency, and his nephews Odet and Gaspart of Coligny, called
Chastillon with many others, represented unto him for the contrary, the
eternal and general dishonor in all countries, which he should get by
breaking his faith, so solemly sworn for the repose of his subjects, and
universal good of all Christendom so miserably torn in pieces, thorough the
continuance of so vilanous warresl: yea and that there was a time, in which
there was demanded of Princes only their word for all assurances: by reason
that they saw them so wise and virtuous, as they would not change their
promises for all the advantages of the world. But as the malice of men
increased, whereto the Princes by little and little participated, so subjects
and strangers have required at Princes hands their faith, and oath, which all
men, yea the very Turks, and other of contrary Religion, hold inviolable,
saving at this day Christians, which first made show of being willing to
dispense with so Religious a bond, as an oath is: which cannot but turn to the
great dishonor and general obloquic of all Christendom: the which no longer
acknowledging any assurance vailable among men, will fall into such a
confusion, that the strongest, and most malicious, will make subject the good,
right, honor and all virtue at his pleasure. By consequence then there is no
appearance of honor to be gotten in succouring the Pope, who of himself, in
respect of the duty of his charge, ought to be ashamed to ask it, and to give
occasion to such perjury and disloyalty. Yea if he were asked, how he would
truly judge, or practice in his own act if he were a King, he would make no
difficulty to dissuade so pernicious a deliberation: much less the hope of a
conquest of a Realm ought to stur him up thereunto, considering the
impossibility of gayning it, or at the least keeping it, by men so far off,
so evil husbands, and bad prouiders against a nation so near and well advised
as the Spanniard: and especially that this hope is founded upon the amity of
Italians, whom we have found for the most part unconstant, and variable in
their duties, as so many examples passed may very well make us wise enough, to
counsel well therein our suruiuours. And it is so far off, that the far
distance of the Emperor ought to encourage us to do evil, as the good
aduices wherewith he has instructed his son: the advised and provident
personages, which he has left unto him for counsel: the alliance of the
English which will furnish him both with men and money: together with the
resolution which he has not to degenerate in ought from the virtues of his
father, nay rather to increase them higher, if occasion did present it self,
ought to make us the more to fear the undertaking thereof, and to assure us
that we shall find enough, nay more forces and means to stay us even in the
best of the enterprise, then if the father himself had taken the conducte
thereof. All this notwithstanding, and many other reasons which were alleged,
could not hinder the breach of the truce and the expedition which was made
into Italy, chiefly in the end by the diligence of the Conestable. For
albeit that he held a hard string to the contrary, yet he slacked for two
occasions. First, that he perceived, through the absence of these undertakers,
he might have fair and easy means to make great and assure his house: so as
he was not in the end over sorry, to see them of the house of Guise, bearing
arms to quitte the Court, and go the voyage, whereof he hoped for no happy
euente. Iointe, that he sought to marry his eldest son, (whom 50000. crowns
had a few days before redeemed out of prison) with the widow of the D. of
Castre, Marriage of Mareschall Montmorency eldest son to the Conestable.
the kings aduowed daughter. Whereupon the marriage being accorded, even as it
stood upon the point to be accomplished, his son let him to understand in
October, by Odet and Gaspart of Coligny his cousin germans, how he had made a
promise unto the Lady of Pienes, and that he could have no other. Whereat the
father grievously displeased, endeavored notwithstanding by all means to
accomplish this marriage. So as having caused Pienes to be put in sure guarde
within the house of Filles Dieu, he considered with himself, that herein he
should stand in need of the Popes assistance, upon that he sent his son to
Rome, The Pope the last succor to fly unto for breach of truce and oaths.
where he found Pierre Sirossy mareschall of France, and they began together
so well to besturre themselves for the Pope, as they recovered again the port
of Ostye, and other places occupied by the Spaniardes about Rome, which served
him but as a prison. And yet all the means which might be, was wrought with
the Pope, that he should not dispense with him to marry any other then Pienes:
fearing least that being once obtained the Conestable would break the desseins
of the war. Whereof he being advertised, and seeing how the Pope used him
but with delays, and dissimulations, he besought him to content himself with
the service which he had done unto him: So as having taken his leave, he
returned to Paris, a few days before Easter, 1557. declaring unto his Father,
that that which he let him to understand of the promise which he had made
unto Pienes, was only to induce him unto the marriage, but that in truth there
was no other matter, in such sort as presently after the marriage was
accomplished with the Lady of Castres. The denial thereof notwithstanding
proceeding from the promise, which he maintained he made unto Pienes, was the
cause of an Edicte which was then published, for the reciprocal duty of
parents and children, upon the occurrance of their marriage.

Edicte of childrens marriages.
THe K. ordayneth, That such children, as shall contract secret marriage,
against the will, or unwitting unto their father; and mother, be disinherited,
and declared incapable of all advantages and profits, which they might
pretend by the means of nuptial conuentions, or by the benefit of customer
or laws of the contrary. And that the fathers and mothers may revoke any
gifts, and advantages given by them. They likewise declared punishable which
shall give counsel and aid for the consummation of such marriages. That this
ordinance shall take place as well for the time to come as passed; because
there is therein a transgression of the law and commandments of God,
wherein no man may cover himself, by any ignorance, or foolish error to the
contrary. Reserved notwithstanding such marriages, as have been heretofore
consummate by carnal cohabitation: and not comprehending sons above the age
of thirty years, or daughters of five and twenty, provided that they use all
duty to seek the advice and counsel of their father, and mother. It grew
then when as the Conestable began to mislike the enterprise of Italy, as I
will tell you elsewhere.

Hereupon the Cardinal carried tydinges of the whole unto his Holiness,
whilst that the King sent the Popes griefs unto the Emperor, and his son
as it were to be the means to render him content. Joint that he would not so
soon attempt any thing against them, for the opinion which he conceived, that
they were not consenting, and less the authors of such novelties. Some
assuredly gave out, that Philippe answering more eagerly then his Father, said
that for his part he desired the continuance of the Truce, The King of Spaines

and rather a peace if it were possible to bring it to perfection. But how he
had always found the Pope, and his affinity so great an enemy unto his
house, that whosoever would declare himself his friend undertaking his
defense, he would hold him for an enemy, and ouerrunne him with all his
forces. This notwithstanding, the King stirred not of a long time any whitte in
the Popes favor, were it that his means were not yet in his hand, were it
that he persuaded himself very well of K. Philips good inclination to the
continuance of the Truce, by the report of Renard his amba^ssadour, who assured
him that his Masters intention was clean contrary to the answer
abouesaide, o^ else that he hoped that the truce would not leave to be kept
inviolable in this case, now that the Imperialles armed themselves in Italy
for the restitution of the Colonois: yea so far as by playntes, and requests
redoubled, they knew that they were entrenthed at Rome gates, where the Pope
was straightly enclosed within the castle of S. Angelo. And further how
Octauian Farneze solicited by the Imperialles, and gained by the Cardinals
Farneze his brother, and S. Fleur his cousin, was reuoulted from the King to
them, who a little before causing his father to be slain, would disinherite
him, which made him to listen ear unto them, who assured him that they meant
to raunge the Pope to the will of the Emperor, and chase the French out of
Italy. So as the King resolved to break the truce, determined to send an
army under Francois de Lorraine Duke of Guise, composed of 6000. Switzers
under the Colonel Frel^, and 4000. French under the Duke of Nemours, with 500.
men at arms, and 500. light horse, who having late enough made ready his
preparatiues, was enforced diligently to hasten to pass over the mountains of
Sauoy, and the Alps in the great frostes and infinite trauayles which Winter
brought with it. Such was one of the principallest occasions of this war. I
leave the pretense of the Realm of Naples, to those who fancy it unto
themselves against those of Guise, without any great appearance. Iointe likewise
the particular reason, which some allege, to show how these Truces made,
and entertained in dissimulation, were but to cover the progress, and effects
of such intelligences as these Princes had one upon another. I will recite unto
you the means by which the Imperialles as the French report, gave just
occasion unto them to break the Truce, and despair of a peace.

Without agrauating say they, Particular causes of the breach of Truce by the

the rigorous entertainment made unto our prisoners of war, more cruel then
could be among the Moors and Infidels: Yea leaving apart how the D. of
Bouillon was villanously, and traitorously poisoned, and afterward sold
being dead, it is most notorious, that a few days after the conclusion of the
Truce, every man on this side, living with a hope of peace at hand, it was
verified by the report of the conspiratours, how many enterprises had been
attempted upon the principal Towns of this Realm, as of the soldiers of
Metz resolved to yeilde the Town, at the pursuit of the Compte de Meigue,
Governor of Luxembourg, and with the priuitie of the Prince of Piemont. The
intelligence upon Bourdeaux in Guienne at the conduct of Barlemont, General of
Finances to the Emperor, a little before Easter, and a month after the Truce
accorded. Few days after there was taken an ingener, and maker of
fortifications, named Jacques de Flectias, who confessed that he was sent by
the Prince of Piemont, to view, and draw the plattes of the principal Towns
upon the Frontire, with money impressed, as Montreul, Saint esprit de Rue,
Dourlan, S. Quentin, and Mezietes. Besides a prouenciall soldier subborned
with great presents to poison the Well at Mariembourg, and consequently the
whole Garrison, thereby to make the surprisall of the town the more easy. Thus
did the Emperor first infringe the Truce contrary to the public oath. Albeit
that all contractes and accordes especially among Princes (who are themselves
to be example of the greatest conformation to the Laws which they make) ought
not only to be without deceit and malice, but exempt of all suspicion,
considering that therein, besides the duty of conscience, and of an honest
man, their particular act alone is not comprised, but the whole good, and
universal repose consists. They add thereto the great preparations of men,
and money, which Philip secretly made of all parts, namely at the soliciting
of the King of Boheme, and Princes of Germany, to undertake a war against
the King, for the recovering of free Towns, without ca^sering his Captains
and men of war. So as soon enough the Garrisons of Mesneil, began to
ouerrunne the platte Country, about Abbeuille, S. Esprit de Rue, Auannes,
Cymetz, Roc-Roy, and Ambenton, under color that famine enforced the^ thereunto.
Henry the^ having seen how K^ Philip still proceeded on against the Pope, and
held Rome beseiged, sent word to Pierre Strozzy (to whom he had given the
office of Mareschall of France, in the room of the late Mareschall de Sedan)
that he should put himself within Rome, and abide the brunte of the Spaniards,
until that the succors should be arrived out of France. In this mean space,

malcontent with King Philip, retired from his service into France, toward
King Henry, who courteously received him, and gave him an honest pension to
maintain him, in such sort as it was not possible for King Philips ministers
to induce him to retire again into Spain, what fair promises soever they
made unto him. Some say that the Governor of the Castle of Milan fled, being
suspected that he would have delivered it up to the King. The which other
auowing to be false, say that the matter was about a quarrel between him and
Ferdinand de Gonzague being disappointed of the government of Milan, by the
means of Don Iean de Lune, and the Chauncelour of Milan. For Gonzague being
afterward returned into favor, and purged of the crimes laid unto him,
pursued in such sort Don Iean de Lune, as he being angry at the small
respect, which was carried to the great services which he said he had done
the Emperor, left Milan, and came into France, without ever making any
practice against the catholic K. The Emperors partisans in the mean time, the
better to settle his affairs in Italy, and seeing how greatly Octauian Duke
of Parma, and his territories (the defense whereof had cost the French so
much) might advantage him, especially in such an occurrence, employed the
Cardinal of Trent, to gain him unto the Emperor, quitting King Henry, who
had done him so great good, and for his sake had made war against the Pope
and Emperor, to the end that the Duchies of Parma and Plaisance might be
restored and assured unto him. In sum the Cardinal Madruch, Bishop and
Lord of Trente, was he, Plaisance rendered to Octauian D. of Parm^^
who according unto the Accord between the Catholic King and Octauian,
restored him into the possession of Plaisance, where he made his entry very
sumptuously, and declared himself against the Pope and all his allies. The
Duke of Alua in the mean space, ouerranne and spoiled the terretorie of Rome,
and besieged the city of Anagne, which the Popes soldiers abandoned, having
burned all the powder and munition. The which astonished in such sort the
Cardinals at Rome, as they got the Pope to send to the Spanish General to
parley of Peace, but all in vain, for as much as the Popes deputies were not
at the break of day appointed for the Pourparley. Which made the Duke so
angry against the Pope, as he rushte upon Pilastrine and Segue, which
yielded: whilst that the Cardinal Caraffe fortified Bellitre, attending
certain troops out of Germany, which he caused to come, in hope of which and
of the french Succoures, he would by no means suffer any parley of Peace,
saying that it was not beseeming for the Pope to seek him, Point of Honor in

who was but a minister of a vassal Prince, and feodarie to the holy Sea.

Already did the forces of Tuscane ouerspread the country of Rome, where the
Marshall Strozzie was. In such sort as Monluc was to view Tiuoly, to see if
it were tenable conducting seven hundred Gascoignes to defend it, in case
there were any means to fortify it. But seeing the place too feeble to endure
a siege, and less proper in any short time to be fortified, he left it,
giving leave to the Citizens to provide for themselves, and to yield it with
the best advantage they could possibly make for themselves, as they did.

After, Monluc being returned to Rome, and F. Vrsin to Vico-Valerio, the
Tiuoliens yielded them selves unto the Duke of Alua: which were followed by
them of Vico-Valerio, in despite of F. Vrsin, who would have defended the
place for the Pope, seeing how necessary it was to hinder any victualles
coming to the Spanishe camp from Naples side.

Behold how the Duke of Alua was able to hold Rome in subjection, having the
places round about at his devotion.

The Duke of Alua besea^e h^ Rome, with the Pope and cardinals so hard as he
thought to fami^l^e them.
Afterward he made a number of fortes on the side of Ostia, to hold the
Romans yet in greater necessity, and cut off their victualles from all
parts, to the end to famishe them. Attending the succors out of France
notwithstanding, Alexander Colomne, which followed the Popes party, was of
opinion that Rome being divided into diverse quarters, there should be in every
one a several Captain put, The means which the French and Italians held to

France.
with his troops to defend it. Therefore Alexander was made Colonel of all
the Romans, which might amount to 7. or 8. thousand, whom he dispersed into
places as he saw need, entermingling among them some Enseignes of soldiers,
as well Italians as Gascoignes. So as Lansac had in guard the gate called De
Populo, having 1000. Gascoignes under his charge. The D. of Palliane, nephewe
to the Pope, had the keeping of the gate S. Agnes, having 800. Almanes in his
company. Iourdan Vrsin come out of Corse, commanded 6. Italian companies at the
gate of S. Lawrence, the Cardinal Caraffe at S. Sebastian, having 500.
Italians, and the rest of the Gascons were under Monluc his charge at the gate
S. Paul. Aurelie Fregose kept between the Tiber, with 1500. souldiars, Camille
Vrsin commanded the quarter of S. Peter, with 2000. footmen. So as these
troops pefourming well their duty, the Spanish General durst not hazard
himself to make any attempt to the town, only he kept himself slyelie
watching his commodities, above all to cut off victuals, whose temporising
notwithstanding was an occasion, that the Cardinal Caraffe went into the
field, ouerranne and wasted the Neapolitane country, whilst that the D. of
Alua, was busied about the Isle and City of Ostia, Ostia taken by the D. of
Alua.
whereof he made himself Master to the great disadvantage of the Romans.
This place being seated upon the mouth of the river Tiber, where she falls
into the Tyrrhene Sea, which upon this occasion serves as a chief Magasin for
the bringing of victuals to Rome. Notwithstanding he took not the Tower and
Forte of the City at that blow. In the mean time the Pope hastened
forwards the Kings succors, and solicited him hard, not to suffer the Duke
of Alua thus to spoil the holy Sea: as he likewise did unto the Venetians,
hoping to draw some succor from them, The Venetians succor not the Pope.
but that Seigneurie comforting him with words, condoled his grievous
mishappes, without using any other duty, or office of amity, saving that
they took pains to seek to appease the differents, and mediate a peace
between him and the Spanyardes. While these things were a doing, and the
Spaniard battering the Forte of Ostia, the Mareschall Strozzie came to the
succor of it with such Troops of France as he had, rearing up certain
rampires, and retrenches, that the enemy should not carry away the cattle,
and other goods of the Romans, enclosed within that Isle. About the end of
December, the King, as I told you above, dispatched the Duke of Guise for to
be General of the army, which his Majesty sent to the succor of the Pope,
and with him Duke Aumalle, and Duke Elbause his brethren, the Duke of Nemours,

knowing that the French army was composed of such a number of men, as I have
told you. The port of Ostia rendered by composition to the Spanyardes.
During which time, such as were besieged in the Forte of Ostia, having abidden
many assaults, their powder failing, their souldiars and citizens for the most
part hurt, in the end yielded them selves by composition, which Ascaigne de
la Corn caused to be accorded reasonably enough, whereat the Romans were
sore abashed. So as by the means of the Cardinals of S. Jacques, and of S.
Flour, they came to make a Truce for ten days. During which, the Duke of
Alua finished the Forte which he had begun in the Isle, bordering on the
port of Ostia, Truce between the Pope and the D. of Alua.
whither the Cardinal Caraffe went unto him, of whom he procured the
prolonging of the Truce, free and marchandable for forty days, with a hope
of a general peace. But Caraffe tended to no other thing, then to solace his
own until the ariuall of the French, of whom he held himself already
all assured. And in the mean time he assayed to draw the Venetians to the
party, who in the end refused to declare themselves against the K. of Spain.
But the D. of Ferrara followed the Popes party, as well for that he was a
vassal and feodarie, as in favor of the K. of France, following the
association already concluded and agreed between them. So had he already
assurance, as I said before, of the title of Defendour of the Church, D. of
Ferrara named the Defender of the Church.
which the Kings of England were wont to carry. The League between the Pope,
the K. and the D. of Ferrara carried: That the Pope should to the number of
twenty thousand footmen, and one thousand horse furnish the whole charges of
the army. The K. should put the like number of fanterie into the field, and
2000. horse, and the Ferrarois 6000. souldiars, 200. men at arms, and 400.
light horse with 20. pieces of battery. League between the Pope, the K. of
France and D. of Ferrara.
Thus the D. of Guise being entered into Italy, with an assured hope to join
such succors to the forces which I have showed you, and a great number of the
nobility which followed him for their own pleasure, (and such as he might
well vau^t that he had near hand the two tierce of the flower of the nobility
of France) could not imprint into the heads of the Italians, but a fear of
great mischief to ensue unto all Italy, which he put into arms, in diverse
hopes and dangerous partialities, through a sudden entry of so many people.
Moreover every man doubting with himself, and fearing least under the color
of the Popes succors the D. of Guise would give elsewhere, was an occasion
that first they fortified Milan, with all her dependances. Then they provided
suddenly strong Garrisons for Cremone, Pauia, Lode, Ast, Valence, Italy in

and other places of importance. And in the mean space the Duke of Florence;
armed himself, and put Garrison upon the Frontiers of Ferrara. He furnished
with souldiars Florence, Pisa, and other Towns under his obedience in Tuscane,
and above all, those which neighboured upon Bologne.

The D. of Alua his disseins.
Upon this the Duke of Alua, who was no whitte ignoraunte of the Spanishe forces
coming against him, was once upon the point to retire to Naples, as well for
the doubt which he had, that he should not be able to sustain the furious
assault of so fresh Troops, as to draw them and hemme them in within the
enemies Countries, thereby by little and little to consume them with Famine,
and other diseases: and had done so, but for the Counsel of Ferdinande
Gonzague: He resolved then for the more expediente to rest there, and to send
Garzie de Toledo, the Compte de S. Flour, Vespasian Gonzague, and other of the
Realm of Naples, to furnishe the Towns of Capue, Arian, Saint Agathe, Venose,
Nolle, Ciuitelle, Aterne, and the rest which are upon the Calabrian Sea: Iointe
that the brute ran how the Turkishe army was to land there in favor of
the French, as it had before done in Corse. The first attempts of the French
army joined with the Marshall Brissae.
The Duke of Guise in the mean time having joined his forces in Piemont, with
the Marshall de Brissaes, was at Valence, which had for Garrison two thousand
souldiars, part Italians, part Spaniardes, and Grizons under Spoluerin.

Now, as the Duke of Guise had caused the brute to be given out, that they
had taken Pauia, and that the Duke of Guise had caused Valence to be summoned
to yield, or that if he took it by force, he would use all the cruelties
which could be looked for in a mortal war, Spoluerin fearing the loss of
his great wealth, did so much after some skirmishes, and number of Cannon
shot, as the souldiars condescended to the yielding of the place, provided
that they might be suffered to depart, lives, and goods saved, the which was
granted unto the^ about the 8. day of January. 1557. But this Captain

being retired to Pauia, were beheadded for yielding so cowardly, having
victual and munition at commandment, within a very strong place, and
without seeing ought which might move them to yield it so soon. It was
then, as the Cardinal of Trent, sent to summon the D. of Guise, to render
Valence up into his hands, the which he had taken against the articles of
Truce: but it was answered him, how the D. of Alua having first broken, he
ought not to marvel if he followed his example: and therefore that he look for
no other effect at the hands of the French then war, until that reason were
yielded to those which were most interessed, further, that he had justly
handled them of Valence, for that his forces marching to the succor of the
Pope, had been braued by that Garrison, the which had saluted the^ with Cannon
shot. As the Duke of Guise marched toward Rome, Strozzy, Monluc, and the
Duke of Palliane, perceiving the Duke of Alua to be retired from before Rome,
beset Ostia, with five hundred soldiers, as well Italians as Gascoignes, Ostia
and (...) fort there of taken (...) Stro^zy and Monl^c
and six hundred horse, which carried it away without any great pains.
Afterward, they besieged the Forte, the which was yielded unto them in the
end by composition, and the Spaniards departed, lives, goods and weapons saved
with some pieces of artillery. At the very same time, the Popes people took
from the Spaniardes, the towns of Bellitre, Tuscule Marin, (which was in old
time called Villa Marij, and Grotta Ferrata, some hold it was Cicero his place
and Seigneuriae, To vnes taken from the Spaniardes.
which he called Tusculanum) and diverse other within the territory of Rome:
They took besides Palesan, and S. Ange, a forte situate upon a mountain: S.
Paul being likewise besieged by the enemy. The Duke of Palliane succored by
the Marshall Strozzy was there, and received the place again being abandoned
by the Spaniardes. Then he was to besiege Vico-Valerio which he took by
assault, and put to fire and sword all those which they met in arms,
giving the pillage to the soldiers. All this passed over under the only
fright of the name of Guise, The D. of Guise takes Coun^^h of what is best to
be done att^ taking of Valence.
and of the army which he led, who having held a Council at Valence, upon
the conduct of his dessein, intelligence still being of what passed at Rome,
and having heard the advice of the Marshall Brissac, Louys de Birague,
Vimercat, and other of his army, it was concluded, that the Marshall and
other Captains ordained in Piemont, should return to Turin, and make as many
roades as was possible upon the enemies country. In the mean time the Duke of
Guise should go toward Ferrara, passing thorough the Country of Plaisance,
the which was accordingly done. But not without the Marquis of Pescaire his
continual being at his tail, without any great prejudice notwithstanding, by
reason of the good order which he gave in the discamping, and conduct of his
army, the which was furnished with victuals in the Placentine Country, by the
commandment of Octauian Farneze D. of Parma: which the D. of Guise caused to
be paid for, expressly forbidding any soldier to do wrong to the subjects of
this Prince. We will leave then for a while the D. of Guise marching with his
forces in Italy to the Popes succor, to enterlace you here an accidente, as
strange, as any which has happened in the memory of our forefathers.

borne at Delph in Hollande, an author of a perverse sect, making himself to
be named by his followers, King and Christ immortal, dyed the year passed,
1556. the 24. day of August, and his wife a little before retired with a very
great family of her own to Basle in the year 1544. He said he was fled his
own Country for the Gospels sake, and there bought houses, and a Castle near
unto the town called Buiuignen, with lands of great reuennewe. He was very
cunning, of great Spirit, and had his eyes addressed on all parts to gain
the hearts of many, and an exterior reputation, which was maintained and
greatly augmented by his riches, his money, and most precious moueables, which
he had brought thither, and which men brought unto him day by day, as well out
of the high, as low Countries of Flaunders, as it falls out, that almost all
men suffer themselves to be cousined with an apparaunce, and magnificence of
worldly things, rather the^ to be carried away with the virtue and truth of
every thing. Two things presaged unto him his death, one of his houses which he
had at Basle was smotte with lightning, and another sumptuously builded within
his pastures, was likewise burned with part of his rarest and most exquisite
moueables: shortly after the flower of the house wherein he lay, fell all down
at one blow, and suddenly: yet nothing happened more grievous unto him before
his death, then the coming of a man of authority out of Base Almania to
Basle. For from thenceforth as well advised and forecasting, he knew that by
little and little he should easily be discovered. His disciples were
marueilously astonished at his death, for that he had assured them of his
immortality, yet their hope was somewhat vpheld, because he had given them to
understand certain days before, how he should take life again, by the
space of three years, and perfect most excellent things. He kept a port
within his house almost like a King, in like sort was the government of his
house and castle very well ruled. Every man had his estate and office: their
charges and duties being so distributed, as he should need to employe no
other therein then his own. In governing their common wealth, they observed
very straightly 3. things, thereby more and more to conceal their pernicious
sect. First that none of them once published the name of David George.
Secondly that none reueyled of what condition he had been: whereupon it grew
that many thought he had been issued out of some great noble House, other
that he was some great Merchant, which had his factours abroad both by Sea
and by land. Thirdly that they should not discover so much as any one article
of their doctrine to any man in Basle, not so much as to a Swizer, nor should
not endeavor to draw any man unto their doctrine: the sum whereof was.

The doctrine of David George Heretic.
THat whatsoever had been heretofore given from God by Moses, by the Prophets,
by Jesus Christ himself, or by his Apostles, was imperfecte, and unprofitable
for the obtaining of the true felicity thereby: And was only given for this
use, that until then it might repress men, as babes, and young children: and
to contain them within their office: But the doctrine of David George was
perfect, and had efficacy to make him happy which should receive it, as
being the true Christ and Messiah, the welbeloeud of the Father, in whom he
took his delight, not borne of flesh, but of the holy Ghost and Spirit of
Jesus Christ, having been kept until that present in a place vnkowen to all
the Saints, to restore in spirit the house of Israel, not by crosses or
tribulations, or death as the other Christ, but by love and grace of the
Spirit of Christ.

In the year 1559. the 5. of March, his children, his sons in law, and all
them of his family, Informations, proceedinges, and judgments of the
Seigneurie of Basle, upon the body and goods of David George and of the
followers of his faith and religion.
with some other adhering to his Sect, were adiourned before the Senate of
Basle, after information made of that pernicious sect, which he had always
held in his life time. The Attorney declared unto them, how the Seigneurie
stood duly infourmed, that they were retired to the Castle of Buiuignen, not
as men persecuted for the Gospel, as they had falsely given out, but for the
sect of David, wherewith they had been already infected. Eleven were made
prisoners to draw out the truth of the whole. The greater part examined by a
more straight inquisition confessed the truth: who in the end obtained pardon.
Then the first day of May, the Ministers, Rectour, Professors, and
Scholemaisters of Basle, having all with one voice condemned the points of the
doctrine, the Senate fully informed of the whole, proceeded the 13. of May to
the conclusion of the process, to wit,

That all his writings, as full of iniquity, and mortal poison, Item his
body, or his bones, and whatsoever should be found more within his grave,
should be burned, together with his picture which they found in his house,
representing him very lively: and that generally all the goods of so wicked a
man, wheresoever they were found, should be confiscate and adjudged to the
Seigneurie.

This sentence was proclaimed according to the Custom of the place, and all
the form of right and ordinances of the Town was kept in the observation
thereof. Before that I handle again the terms of war, between the French
and Spanyardes, I will finishe, and in few words, the Empire, and managing of
the affairs of Charles of Austria the fifte, Emperor of the Almanes.

About the end of August, Charles of Austria resolved to pass into Spain for
the occasions before rehearsed, went from Bruxelles to Gaunt, the place of his
nativity, where he assembled the 27. of that month, all the Ambassadors one
after an other, resiant about his Person, within his chamber, The speech which
Charles of Austria used to the Ambassadors resiante about his person* when as
he left Flaunders to return into Spain, there to finish his days.
using in general no other speech unto them, but of the declaration of his old
age and indisposition, praying the^ to perform all good offices for the
repose due unto Christendom: Protesting to the Nuncio (that is the Popes
Ambassador,) how all his life long, he had loved and defended the holy
apostolic Sea: and to the Venetian, how much he honored that Seigneurie and
common wealth, whose liberty, and preservation he had all his life long
desired, knowing how much she nourished, and mainteyned the repose of Italy.
That his Son should follow him therein, having left it as an express, nay
testamentarie commandment unto him. To them of Ferrara and Mantoue he spoke
in general, but somewhat more particularly to the Florentine, charging him to
write unto his Master, that he should never lend his care to any new
practices against his house, nor pass nothing without aduertising of his
Son, as he had very well done, until that present, and whereby he thought
he took no harm, as it appeared. Hereupon, the Ambassador, who was a
Bishop, would have dissuaded his departure, and showed him, how his most
affectionate friends were much astonished, considering especially that all
reasons, and good discourse, were clean contrary to such a resolution. And
that in stead of going into Spain, he were better draw up into Italy, or at
the least not abandon his Son, whom he might assist with his good
counsel. To whom aunswearing, that he could not imagine an old Prince, evil
disposed, and afflicted in all parts as he was, was able to do as a young
Prince, whom he left so well instructed, and in so good a will to show
himself great, and a man of war if he were urged thereto: and that it
should be well known, how his absence should no whitte at all prejudice his
friends. The Bishop would have replied upon the affairs and greatness of
this world, but he interrupted him, praying him to think, that his thoughts
were no longer enter commoners with the world, to which he badde farewell, and
to him likewise, and so they departed. After he was at Sail five Leagues from
Gaunte, where his Son gave him the last adieu. Himself going down the river
to embarque at Vlishing in Zelande, whither the Queens Allenor, and Marye his
Sisters followed him, until he was embarked. Then Philip made his return to
Gaunte, where the multitude of affairs began to solicit his brain,
especially in the expedition of them, in the remarke of humane actions, in the
choice, and recompense of his servants, whom he chose and cherished, after
another manner of fashion then his Father. But I must again handle the
enterprise of the French upon Italy, in favor of Pope Iulye, whose disseins
and conducte the better to open unto you, I am content to research the affairs
of Piemont, where they passed somewhat in a higher kind.

The means which the K. used to make the D. of Guises army to pass into
Italy to the succor of the Pope.
To favor the passage of the Duke of Guises army, the King had already
commanded the Marshall Brissac, who was but a little before come out of
Piemont to the Court, (where de Terms commanded in his absence) to return
thither again, and make ready another army, the better to second the Dukes
in Romaigne, and assay to make some other exployts for the service of his
Majesty, with promise that he should not be far gonne on his journey
before money should be sent him, as well to pay the old bands of France
and Italye lying in Piemont, as to prepare the new forces, which was
convenient he should add thereunto. Not seeing for all that, the effect of
the provision of the said money to follow, which was promised unto him for
the men of war, pioners, horse to draw the artillery, building of bridges
upon boats, munitions of victualles, and other things necessary to the
following of an army, he made many dispatches and instances unto his Majesty,
and the Conestable, who as then had the Superintendance of all the affairs of

but he could only obtain a slow and no complete provision: and less to
perform any advancement of honor to any Captains of mark as their
services deserved. Notwithstanding about the end of December, 1556. the
Mareschall made an other recharge to the same end, and likewise gave his
Majesty to understand of the resolution taken between the Duke of Guise and
him, upon the breach of the Truce, and passage of the army into Italye: which
breach began upon the enterprise, as they fantasied unto themselves, of the
town of Valence within the Duchy of Milan, having after many deliberations
found this enterprise most fit and commodious for the more easy passage of
the Dukes army. The army being ready in the month of January, albeit it
was not succored with the assignations promised, yet not to suffer it for
default thereof to lie still, the Marshall borrowed upon his own credit,
many gross sums, and especially of the Duke of Guise. Yet all was so little
to the price of that which was due, as they had much ado to draw the old
Italian bands out of their garrisons, or any of the new french Companyes.
Which made the army more weak then it would have been. As the Secretary
Bounin declared, who as well for the effect, as the reasons abouesayde, was
expressly dispatched: chiefly likewise to give his Majesty to understand, how
to the end the platte country of Piemont, might not be left in pray to the
garrisons of Aste, Valserniere, Fossan, and Coni, whiles the forces of the
Country were so far esloigned off, it was thought fit to make a Levy of
3000. foot, and 200. light horse, which should lie dispersed about the
Imperial garrisons, and the money for their payment leuyed upon the Country.
Whereto those which were chosen made great difficulty to consent, yet all was
well executed in the end. And the 14. of February, S Foy had the charge given
unto him of 5. Companies of Piemont, and 100. light horse, and the rest of the
said Leuies, were from hand to hand distributed round about these Garrisons.
The which caused great suertie, commodity and succor to his Majesty's
affairs. Then according to the resolution taken upon the breach of Truce, The
order which the Marshall Brissac gave in Piemont.
the two armies marched toward Valence, which they assailed the 12. day of
January. So as after the Battery had been laid unto it, the 14. of that
month, the Governor rendered it up, upon the occasions before said. This
done, they held a Counsel to advise, upon what should be necessary as well
for the passage of the D. of Guise, as the rest of the affairs concerning the
K. service. To whom among other particulars it was proposed by the Mareschall,
that his Majesty's intent being to succor the Pope, it was best to bethink
of the propiest and most easiest means to execute his Commandment, and
increase his authority in Italy. Which as then was very easy, the enemies
and especially the Inhabitants of Milan being in such fright and fear, as
standing very tickle within the Town, Enterprise of Milan.
which was abandoned by a great number of men, seeing the greater part without
any Fortress, it was very easy for the Duke taking that way, to enter in:
Iointe that there were no forces to hinder him, or which durst oppose
themselves against him. That being Master of the Town, he should be
consequently of the whole Estate, having power to command there with such
authority, as in few days he should have means to finishe what remained
therein to be fortified with earth and faggots, to cut off and cover the
said Town from the Castle. To favor which enterprise, and occasion more
business unto the enemies, the Marshall offered to go besiege some little
town there, if he found any facility at all to essay with, the Artillery to
carry it away, and that in the mean time Saluoisin Governor of Casal,
should go at a day agreed upon between the Generals attempt, with the
soldiers of the Garrison, the execution of the enterprise which he had upon
the Town of Alexandria, of the places of most importance of the state of
Milan. Whereof there could no other then a good issue be expected, as well by
the intelligence which one gave from thence unto the Counsel, and whom the
Captain Saluoisins Secretary expressly went to fetch for that purpose, as that
Saluoisin had him self taken a view of the place. And to the end that
Saluoisin might the better keep it being taken, the Mareschall promised to
come thither on the morrow after the execution thereof with his whole army:
as well to assist Saluoisin, as to provide for whatsoever should be necessary
for the assurance, and conservation of the place, and that shortelie after he
would march to Milan, to give order with the Duke of Guise for the getting of
the Castle, and for such affairs as concerned the Kings service: and so to
make the State assured unto his Majesty. Thorough the consideration whereof it
was not to be doubted, but the Duke of Alua with the forces which he had in
Romagne, would leave the Country to come succor the rest of that Estate: as
a matter of greater importance unto his Master, then the quarrel of the
Pope. Who notwithstanding should by this means have the succoures which he
desired, without hazzarding an army in such dangers as might fall out in so
long voyages, and to which all such as have heretofore passed through Italy in
favor of the Popes, have for the most part been subject. Thus should the
will of his Majesty be performed, with the Conquest of an whole Estate, for
which, What success the French armies have had in Italy, especially in the
conquest of the Realm of Naples.
War had been so long time made in the House of France. Furthermore the
hope and apparaunce which was there to gain the whole, or at the least a great
part of the Seigneurie of Genes, yea by the inhabitauntes own good will,
thorough the necessity of Victualles, into which they were brought. Provided
that his Majesty, to whom a dispatche for that end should be sent, would
command the Galleyes of Marseilles to scowre the Seas, and to keep the Coast
of Sicilie in subjection, to keep the Genowaies from being that ways any
more succored with Corn, then they should be out of Piemont. And indeed
the dearthe was there so great, for the small time which they were in the
Duchy of Milan, and thourough the taking of Valence, as that a sack of Corn
was worth ten Crowns. The propositions being at large debated of, were in
the end found so good, and accompanied with so apparaunt reasons, as the most
part of them which were of the Counsel, seeing the importance of such
Estates, as those of Milan and of Genes, which made a way unto his Majesty to
increase his power and authority in Italy, Iointe the uncertain and so
variable occurrents, as might befall an Army, in so long a voyage, and by
such an enemy so ready and resolute, were of opinion, that they were to be
hearkened unto, and that his Majesty should with all diligence be advertised
thereof. But the Duke of Guise having an other intent of greater importance,
told them that he had received Commandment from the King to proceed
onwardes and not to stay: An occasion that many have since depraved this his
advise, especially after the end of his enterprise.

But Lautrec in the like accidente, conducting the French army, for the
taking of Naples, after the delivery of Frauncis the first, allied with the
Potentates of Italy, 1527. having taken the Town of Bosco, Alexandria,
Vigeneue, Pauia, and other places, as it was deliberated in Counsel, whether
they should stay upon the Conquest of Milan, (to which they which held the
French party besought him to employe his men, considering the resolution of
them, and the fright of their enemies,) or pass forwards, answered that he
had commandment to seek further, and that he was principally sent into
Italy, for the delivery of Pope Clement.

True it is, that some thought Lautrec took this resolution, fearing least if
they should conquerre the Duchy of Milan, the Venetians being confederate
with the French, would be careless to succor the King in the Conqueste of
Naples. And it is possible likewise that the King thought, it would be better
for him that Frauncis Sforze might not entirely recover this Estate, to the
end that no power remaining unto him to be able to undertake ought, he
might the more easilye obtain the deliverance of his children, as yet the
Emperors prisoners, by way of accord, which continually was treated of,
about the Emperor, by the Ambassadors of France, England, and Venise.

Thus then the D. of Guise resolved upon his first advise, caused a bridge of
boats to be made at Basignaue over the river Tauaro, where his army seconded
with the Marshall Brissacs, passed over to perform the voyage of Italy. And
to the end that it might be done with more surety, and that he might
avoid the meeting of the forces which the Marquess of Pescarie caused in all
diligence to be assembled, thereby to cut him off from his passage, the
Marshall entered within Laumeline, with a countenance as though he would
march toward Milan: An occasion that the Marquess turned bridle suddenly
toward Milan, with the few forces which he had, suffering the Duke of Guise
freely to pass, and his army, whither it liked him best.

Upon whose Ariuall, the Duke of Alua, for want of money, and to suffer the
first fury of the French to cool, leuyed his siege from Rome, and retired
upon the borders of the Kingdom of Naples, there to defend the Frontiers from
the disseins of the French.

As for the Duke of Florence, he to keep his dependances from waste, and
spoil of the enemy, and likewise to get leisure to go on with his
Fortresses, lent his ear to some alliance with the King. But fortified as he
was, he retired within his Town. In such sort, as Pierre Strossi Marshall
of France, being departed one of the first, and enclosed himself within Rome,
with a number of French and Italians, had already under the favor of the
Dukes coming, combated, and taken certain Fortes and Blockehouses, builded by
the Imperialles round about the Town, and upon the Tiber: so as the Pope was
before the ariuall of the French, as it were, restored into full liberty, and
Rome assured of her enemies.

I will show you by and by what the Duke did as soon as he was approached unto
the capital City of Italy, against the disseins of his enemies, who prepared
themselves to all euentes, and in sundry places.

Now, albeit there was no talk of any war in France, but only by murmurs,
and particular presages, more then any public declarations, War begun in
France against the Truce.
many presumed that the war of Italy would give a beginning to that of
France, yet the brute being given out, how the Arthois and Henaute Garrisons
were reenforced to make a check upon some of the Frontiers, the Admiral
Governor of Picardie, thinking to play with the cunningest, meant to prevent
them, and first of all, himself to break the Truce in Picardie. In such
sort, as about the beginning of January. 1557. having ambushte himself near
Douay, he had entered in, in the night, while the most part of the Garrison
was droncke, with drinking and crying the king drinks, had not an old woman
by her long and loud cryinges out, of Arm, Arm, the French, given in the
end the Alarm thorough out, having soon enough discovered some indiscreete
persons among the foremost of the French. But being returned to Lans in
Arthois, and entered within, The Admiral breaks the Truce in France.
he suffered it to be so pilled, as the Imperialles for a long time reproached
those cruelties to the French: besides that they alleged the taking thereof,
among the first occasions of the breach of Truce.

You see then on this and that side, the Spanyarde and French disposed to
war, seeking all means to ruin them selves more furiously then ever. Now
for that the broils in Piemont, as the first seem to me more remarkable,
Iointe that certain months passed over in France, and the Countries
bordering about, in the preparations of a future war, without any other more
notable effects then above rehearsed, I will remember again the Mareschall
Brissac, to show you, how having taken the Imperialles at unawares, he
pursued the point of his aduauntages.

After the departure of the Duke of Guise and his army, the Mareschall gave
himself to fortify and munition Valence with all that was necessary: abiding
notwithstanding, a certain time in Lomline, to hold the General of the
Imperialles in suspense of his disseins. And had undertaken matters of greater
importance, had money been in his hands to content his people, and furnishe
out such things as were needful for him. But for want thereof, resolved to
retire himself, and keep his advantages, he furnished Casal, Montcalue,
Valence, and Santia, each of them with ten Enseignes of Fanterie, and some
Cauallerie, against the enterprises of the Marquess, whose Forces grew
greater to the diminution of the French, for the occasions abouesayde. And
albeit that the want of money, and the cutting off already made by the King of
certain Companies of Piemont, as well in number as in pay, were sufficient
occasions to hinder the Estate of his affairs in that Country, he sent unto
the Mareschall notwithstanding about the end of February, that in any sort
soever, he should not meddle with the dead pays. And that every month he
should send him an accounte, to the end he might assign warrant for money
to the Treasourer of the extraordinary: without any whitte regarding how
nothing having been sent for the artillery carriages, Pioners, munitions,
commissaries, and matters unlooked for, the Mareschall said he was feign to
help himself with those dead paies. So as founding upon such defaults the
small advancement which he made in Piemont, and seeing how he preached to a
deaf ear, he besought but in vain his Majesty, about the month of May, to
send some Gentleman unto him, to control his actions, to the end that no
evil might be presumed of him. This notwithstanding, albeit that he durst
not muster his army, for fear of mutinies, thorough want of pay, and that
he was resolved not to remain idle, he employed his credit to recover a
sum of money, to make a loan unto the companyes of Fanterie, attending the
Kings money. And having thus made them to go into the field, he led them,
for the execution of the Counsel, to batter, and take in parley, the 22. of
April, Valeserniere, notwithstanding the great and continual raynes, all the
while that the siege endured. A Town which wasted all Piemont, and scowred the
way from Ast, to Cony, Queras, and Emerast: and Queras being with the self
same fury, besieged, battered, and suddenly assailed, was taken by force the
29. of April, the fourth day of the siege. Whereupon to increase this fire of
good will, and make the poor soldier to live, more upon the expense of the
enemy, then of the allie, the siege of Cony was resolved upon and begone in
the same month. Whether the K. sent money, which very little exceeded the only
pay of the Zwizers. The Mareschall notwithstanding appointed mustars to be
taken, of the French and Italian Fanterie. But as soon as the soldiers knew,
that they would give but a crown a piece to a man, and that by the hands of
the Treasourer, the soldiers were not slack to mutiny, and go away in great
Troops, considering their long services, which had never been acknowledged,
and the new fashion of paying them, by other men's hands then their Captains:
who showing themselves no less grieved, and resting the beholders of such
insolences, without stirring to punish any, they made the Marshall go
himself to procure them to return back, and assure them that the money
should be delivered unto their Captains, to distribute as they were
accustomed. And albeit that so little money did not much content them, yet the
siege was continued. In which the Mareschall seeing that the battery wrought
no great effect, and yet they which were besieged, showed a countenance as if
they would yield if they were lustily pursued, it was agreed that a mine
should be made, right against the Battery. Wherein they wrought long with
danger and difficulty notwithstanding. But in in the end being finished,
well closed, and sealed up, the fire put, and the assault given by the ruin
which it had left, the order established for the assault was so evil kept,
and besides the Souldiars went so slackely to work, as the Master of the
Camp being slain, and a number of Gentlemen and Soldiers, who were the first
which advanced foremost, being dead on the earth, and the rest beaten back
with the hurt of many gallaunt men, the euente showed how of an army evil
satisfied, full of Captains and Soldiers discontented and disobedient, no
other success ought to be hoped for then unfortunate.

In the mean time the Mareschall sent to declare unto the King, together with
the necessities of his army, and the fear least all would turn to ruin for
him, the instance which the Duke of Ferrara made, to cause the French army to
approache to the Duchy of Milan, to the end to help it with his forces and
disseins: and likewise the impossibility of being able to satisfy it,
without paying at least the Fanterie.

Not long after, the Mareschall having received news, how the Marquess of
Pescare was arrived at Fossan, with some forces in intention to approach near
Cony, to favor them within, or assaye to compel the siege to be raised, a
Counsel was held, and resolved to abandon Cony, to martch right toward the
Marquess. But as soon as he perceived the Mareschall to approache, he
retired into Fossan, to the which the French still approached. By means
whereof the Marquess fearing to be enclosed there, consequently himself to
reduce this place to extreme necessity, he wrought so well, as with the whole
Infanterie he gained Cony: But from thence not knowing how to return, he was
constrained to lead his men a trauerse the mountains to gain the Sea shore,
and save his people as well as he might. The difficulty of the ways
notwithstanding was found such, as he lost many of his people, and they which
saved themselves, so weary, and defeated, as it was not possible to be more.
As for his men at arms, and his Cauallerie, they remained still within Fossan.
Therefore it was agreed, that waste should be made there round about. And
further that Forces should be laid all a longest the passages and ways, that
none of the Cauallerie might escape.

During the time that it was thus enclosed, many fair feats, and notable
skirmishes were undertaken, and diversely executed: Namely by the Vidasme of
Chartres, Colonel of the Fanterie of Piemont, D'Anuille de Terrides, and
others, with so good watch kept all alongest the passages, as many Troops of
this Cauallerie, which was no less then between one thousand and twelve
hundred horse, were entrapped and defeated. The French in the mean space,
entertained the siege before Cony, and many Gentlemen and Captains trauayled,
who should be marked to work most to the damage of the besieged. Among the
rest, word was sent unto the King of the feats done by the Vidasme, since
the raising of the siege. Especially in the breaking up of milles, which had
been repaired by them of the Town, blocked with a number of Fortes, which
marueilously annoyed him. And likewise the happy enterprises achieved about
Fossan, by De Terms, Gonor, D'Anuille, and other, who gave so small rest to
their Troops of Cauallerie, especially their light horse, whose coursings out
were more ordinary, and remarkable, as all thought they had yielded occasions
enough unto his Majesty, to be well and sufficiently requited, for so well
perfourming of their duty.

You shall see how, and wherefore the means wanted unto their Prince rather
then the will, through the accidents, which less fortunate in other places of
France then in Piemont, happened at the same time, to counterpease the
Mareschals good fortune by the disgrace of his Conestable, as I will make you
to perceive, if you well and dilligently mark all the notable particularities,
which I will deduce upon such and so important an occurrence. For it is less
then nothing to know the inconvenience of the journey of Saint Quentins: That
is known as well to fools as wise men, young, and old, men and women,
homebirdes and strangers, friends and enemies. But to apply it to ones
profit, to the surety, and advancement of the State, one must understand
the beginning and true motive: dilligently, and with affection mark the means
as well forced as voluntary, by which this disfavor happened: then note the
effects of them, and in the end consider the good and the badde, which has
ensewed unto France, and the Countries about, under the obedience of these
two Princes. This is called to reason of, and to read Histories as it
appertains. The which I will do, having represented unto you the deportement
of the Duke of Guise, and his Army in Italy.

From Plaisantin the Duke of Guise went to Regge, a Town which appertained to
the D. of Ferrara his father in law, who met him at Pont de Leuz, and all in
company, with the Cardinal Caraffe, sent thither by the Pope entered within
Regge, where they consulted of the dissein, means, and conduct of this war.
Some would have gone into Lombardie to attempt the getting of Cremone and
Pauia, whilst that Brissac did his duty upon that side of Nouarre and
Valence. Other who considered that in so doing they should give leisure to the
Duke of Alua to fortify himself, and to make a leauie of men, as well within
the kingdom of Naples as Tuscane, without forcing for all that, any one of
those Towns furnished with all things necessary, were of opinion that they
should rush upon Tuscane to deliver Siene out of the Florentines and Spaniardes
hands. The Cardinal Caraffe found it most aduantagious to assail the
kingdom of Naples, by the March of Ancone (the territory of the ancient
Picentines) saying that on that side of Terre de Labor, he might conquer as
much of the Country as seemed good unto him. But the Duke of Ferrara
maintained, that the Duke of Guise being come for the cause of his holiness,
he ought likewise to go straight on to Rome, and employ himself to the defense
of the Pope. And that afterward the rest should be thought of. That in the
mean time he would keep himself with his forces in his own Countries,
forasmuch as he trusted not the Duke of Parma his neighbor, D. of Ferrara at
Venise and why
having entered into league with king Phillip: and that he feared besides least
the Florentine would make roades into his lands, if he esloigned himself.
Corregge taken by the Spaniards upon the D. of Ferrara.
So as according to this advise the Duke of Guise marched with Caraffe toward
Bologne, and the Duke of Ferrara leaving the Prince Alphonce his son for his
lieutenant, went to Venise to answer the Ambassador of Spain, who made
there grievous complaints against him, blaming the Pope, and King Henrye to
make war unjustly against his Master, and to break the truce so necessary
to Christendom: beseeching the Seigneurie to make war against the Ferrarois,
and to enter into league with the Catholic King. Now as the Duke of Ferrara
soiorned at Venise, the Marquess of Pescare seized upon the Town of
Corregge, The French army in Italy.
whence sprange the first beginning of the war in the Country of Ferrara. An
occasion, that the Duke leaving Venise returned into his own lands, to
fortify Modene, Carpi, and other places of his Seigneuries: whilst that the
Duke of Guise at Bologne, complained to the Popes ministers, how he saw no
such preparation of war, as had been promised unto the King. But they
contented him, when they told him that there were ten thousand men in the
March d'Ancone. And having passed by Imole, Rauenne, Faenze, and Cesene, he
came to Rimini, where he viewed, and mustered his Troops, which he found to
amount unto five thousand Swizers, over which the Marquess d'Albauf his
brother commanded: four thousand Grisons, seven thousand French, and
Gascoignes, some Italians, five hundred and fifty men at arms, and fifteen
hundred light horse. Over the Fanterie commanded the Duke of Neuers. Cipierre
was Master of the Camp. Tauannes, and La Motte Gondrin, were Mareschalles of
the Camp. On the other side the Mareschall Brissac coming out with his Forces
into the field, caused Valle-Feniere to be besieged, a strong place situate
between Ast, and Carmignolle, which he enforced to yield by composition, for
the want of victuals which the Spanyardes had that held it: afterward it was
ruyned topsie toruie. This done, he made Chiauasse to be assailed, a Castle
situate in a high place, and bordering upon Vlpian, which he carried away,
albeit it was furnished with all things necessary, and there he put in a
strong Garrison to keep it. While these things were a doing, the Duke of Alua
caused his Army to turn head, D. of Alua in the Kingdom of Naples.
as though he meante to go to the Kingdom of Naples to defend it, imagining
that the Duke of Guise would martche thither. Then he furnished, and
fortified the towns of Arbuzze, a country neighboring to the march of Acone,
and in the mean space the Duke of Guise took Campilio, and besieged
Ciuitelle, situate upon the Tiber on Tuscane side, mounted upon a high
hillocke, having a rock for the foundation of the walls, and of a most hard
access unto it. So as nature serving it for a rampire, it seemed almost
impregnable, thorough the great steepes of her most deep valleys, all
alongest which runs the river Viperate. An occasion that it lay not in the
power of the French to enforce it, but they were feign to leauie the siege
after they had lost many good souldyers and valyant men. Likewise little did
the Marshall of Brissac gain at the same time by the siege of Conie: For
albeit that he had battered day and night this place appertayning to the Duke
of Sauoy, yet he was feign to leave it in the end, for the succor which the
Marquess of Pescare had brought thither. Now albeit the Duke of Guise
advanced little before Ciuitelle, the Duke of Alua notwythstanding came to
leauie the siege. Ciuitelle rescued from the French.
So as having sent certain troops under the charge of Garsie de Toledo, and
County de Pepoly, to see what countenance the French made, they were so
roughly reencountered, as Garsie being defeated, and his troops put in rout,
Pierre Henriques master of the Duke of Alua his camp, was there taken, and
almost all the Spaniardes cut in pieces, by the Vidasme of Chartres, Tauannes,
Cipierre, and others. Afterward the French being constrained to leave the
place for the reasons abouesayde, were drawn to Mont-fort by the inhabitants,
who saying they were not able to supporte the insolency of the Spaniardes,
would not be reduced under the obedience of the Pope. But they could not
yield the town, which was the cause that the Duke de Palliane having battered
it and scaled it, carried it away by assault. The Spaniardes being retired by
another place of the Town, and so the Citizens bare their penance, being
well pilled, their town burned, and half ruined. Afterward the Duke of
Palliane, and the Marshall Strozzie joined both their forces with the Duke of
Guises. Who seeing that what the Popes Legates and Nounces promised unto the
King, was but wind without effect, and that there was no means to increase
his forces in Italy, as the Duke of Alua did his ordinarily: he wrote unto
the King, giving him to understand, that without new succors it was
impossible for him to advance his desseine, considering his enemies forces, and
the small favor which he found in those quarters. Some have left in writing,
that that which moved the Duke of Guise to write in that manner unto the King,
was for that he was advertised, how Codognac the kings Ambassador at
Constantinople, was dismissed of his charge, and La Vigne put into his place.
And as he attended one hundred Turkish Gallyes which were promised by Soliman
to Codognac for his succors, he received intelligence how the Turk had
changed his mind, through some too high words uttered by La Vigne. Others say
that it was thorough the practice of some French men, enemies to La Vigne. In
such sort as the Kings service was thus retarded in Italy, for occasions
slight enough. Natalis County of Nuouolare, confessed that the Turk would
not stir one whit in this business for the king in Italy, for that he saw
no profit redound to himself. Joint that he doubted least the Christians
agreeing together would seek to diminishe his forces, and afterward make
some attempt against him. And in deed those which were in Corse at such time
as Dragut-Rais brought thither the Turks succors, know that when the French
besieged Calui, as the Turks had demanded the first point of the assault,
seeing themselves cruelly and bloudily cut in pieces, they began to suspect
and mistruste the Christians, to see how the Spaniardes and the Frenchmen made
war the more gently one upon another. And Jorden Vrsin had enough to do to
content them, and to pull out that hard impression which they had conceived
against the French.

The Duke of Guise in sum, seeing how on all parts the effects failed of
so rich promises as had been made unto his master, and confirmed unto him
since his coming into Italy. Join that the forces of the Spanish Duke began
to grow greater, and increase in courage, by the advertisement which they had
of the necessities of the French, before that his own were too much
diminished, and the advantage too evidently turned elsewhere, resolved to put
it to the hazard of one day. Therefore seeing himself near enough unto the
Duke of Alua his camp, he presented battle unto him between Fermie and
Ascolye. To which the Spaniarde would not hearken: Were it that he found
himself too weak, or that he thought by delaie he might better serve his
turn. In the mean time King Phillip had no sooner made the advantage of his
army to appear in Picardie, but the King sent to the Duke of Guise, The Pope
retains the d. of Guise
that he should retire home. Who seeing that all the burden of the war
lighted on the Kings arms, and that it was so far of from the Popes
furnishing of twenty thousand men, as he had promised, that he was not able
to pay six thousand, nor disburse the fourth part of the charge of the
army. Ioynte that the Ferrarois were so far from succouring the Pope or the
King, as the Duke of Guise was feign to aid him with some of his men, fearing
besides least the Pope would make a peace without comprehending the King
therein, concluded to return into France. But the Pope fearing to be left
alone, and least he should be afterward compelled to accord at the will and
discretion of the Spaniard, swear unto him that he would never agree without
the Kings advise and consent thereto: and how for the better assurance thereof
he would send his son the Duke of Palliane, as hostage into France. So as
this so large an offer retained the French longer, during whose vain aboade
there happened the defeat of Saint Quentin in Permandois. Which being known
at Rome, so greatly astonished the Pope, as seeing himself out of all hope to
have any further succor out of France, he resolved to follow the counsel
of sundry Cardinals, which very earnestly solicited him to make a peace
with the Spaniarde. Who in the mean time determined to plant again the siege
before Rome: not that he was in any hope to take it, but only to enforce the
Pope to a peace, which he knew was greatly desired by the Catholic king. But
the Duke of Guise understanding this desseine, and the effects thereof, failed
not to approach unto Tiuoli, a place situated upon the Teueron, to front the
enemy, and to enforce him to leauie his siege. The which was the cause that by
all the means they possibly could, they hastened the treaty of the peace
sought by the Venetians, and the Duke of Florence. The Pope sending on the
eight of September in his name, the Cardinals Carlo Caraffe, Saint Fior, and
Vitolloce, with some Roman Lords toward the Duke of Alua, who as then lay
at Canie, a place situate in the Roman Country, near to Pilastrine, to
confer of the whole.

Peace negotiated, and by whom.
Between whom it was concluded and agreed, that the Duke of Alua and the
Cardinal Caraffe would resolve thereof together at Benessan, which is not
far from them: having each of them ample power and commission from their
master, to determine and conclude of all things, according as the Popes
Letters carried for the Cardinal Caraffe, dated the eighth day of September,
1557. at Rome: and king Phillips, for Don Ferdinande Aluarez de Toledo, Duke of
Alua, dated the five and twenteeth of July. In sum, the peace was concluded
between the Pope and the Spaniard, and such were the Articles: Articles of
peace between the Pope and the Spaniard.
That the Duke of Alua doing all kind of obeysances due, and submissions in
the name of the king of Spain his master, should beseech pardon of the Popes
holiness: That he should receive him as his good and obedient son,
participating unto him such graces as were common to other: That king Phillip
should do the like, by an Ambassador expressly sent from him to Rome: That
the Pope as a merciful and debonarie Father, should receive the Catholic
king as his son, and give unto him all such graces as he was wont to do,
and accord to other Christian kings: That his holiness should renounce the
league with the French king, and declare himself a father to the one and the
other of both the kings, without any one more than the other: That the
Catholic King should render up all the towns, places, castles, and
fortresses, being of the domaine of the Church, which had been taken since the
ouerture of this war. He should make be builded again and repaired, all
such as had been ruined and dismembered by the Spaniardes: That all the
artillery taken on the one side or the other, in what sort so ever, should
be restored again into the hands of his ancient possessour: That they
should forget all such executions as had been done by justice during this
war, were it by death or bannishment: and all confiscations of what persons
whatsoever, without any man's researching after into them. As also all such
as thorough this dissension were driven out of their lands, goods, and
dignities, should be restored into their good renown, goods, honors,
states, and dignities, right actions, and Seignouries. Provided that they had
lost these things by means of this war, to the end this peace might not
be available to Mark Anthony Colone, nor to Ascaigne de la Corn, but that
they should remain outlawed, at the will and discretion of the holy Father.
That the Duchy of Palliane should be put in such estate as it was then, by
the consent and good liking of both parties, into the hands of Iean Barnardin
Carbon, which was the sequestrer, who should swear to the Pope and the
Catholic King, to keep faith to both parties, and observe the articles and
agreements made and accorded between the Duke of Alua and the Cardinal
Caraffe. Which Carbon was to have the keeping of the Town of Palliane, having
under him eight hundred souldyers, paid by the Pope and the Catholic king.

These Articles were sworn to in the name of the said Princes, the Pope, and
king Phillip, by the Cardinal Caraffe and the Duke of Alua, according to the
Commission and faculties given unto them, swearing by the souls of their
Princes, to observe all the whole without fraud, cauelling, or any exception
whatsoever: adding a truce for a certain time, containing pasport and
safeconduct to the Duke of Guise, and to all the Captains and souldyers of the
king of France, to depart out of Italy, and the Countries appertayning unto
king Phillip, as well by sea as by land. Afterward they signed and sealed the
whole in the presence of the Cardinals of S. Flour, and Vitelle, who likewise
signed the present Treatise. And for so much as it was not set down therein to
whom Palian should appertain, since that the sequestrer kept it in the name
of both the princes contracting, there were secret articles agreed upon
between the Cardinal Caraffe and the Duke of Alua. In which it was contained,
how that it should remain at the will and discretion of the catholic king,
either to ruin or leave that place in her entire, without being lawful for him
to repair or fortify it, until the said Lord King had given some place of
like value and reuenew to the Popes son for recompense. And any difference
falling out upon that exchange, the Senate of Venice should give judgment
thereof, without either the one or the other parties refusing to obey what
should be ordained by that Seignorie. And the recompense being once made by
king Phillip, he might then bestow the place of Palian upon whom it liked
him best, saving any such as were an enemy to the Church of Rome. And that he
which should have Palian in sequestration, should be bound to depart so soon
as the place were dismembered. Such was the issue of the affairs of Italy, and
of the army which the King sent for the Popes succor, the which was followed
with a strange ouerflowing inundation of Tiber, as I will cause you to see
elsewhere.

Now that each party had of a long time turned his desseignes to the war,
covered notwithstanding by the conclusion of this truce, yet had the Spanish
Council much better and from longer hand provided for the preparatiues and
inconveniences thereof. For Phillip put as soon an army against that of
Italy (by which he drew out of the realm, the flower of the nobility, and
the most renowned Captains and soldiers which were there) the most
accomplished and best furnished with all necessaries of any that had been
seen of long time. The desseines and old preparations of king Phillip.
To the end he would not fail to set forward his first fortune, which he
meant to prove in the view of all the potentates of Europe, especially of the
French, in whom he meant to ingraue by the beginning of his enterprises such
a dread of his forces and means, as that for ever after they should be more
stayed, and less stirring against him, than they had been against any of his
ancestors. Henry on the contrary (as the French is never advised but upon the
blow) providing only for his army which marched to affranchise the Pope from
his enemies, Dessignes and preparations of king Henry.
(to whom succors was almost as soon promised as demanded) having understood
but too late, through want of intelligence the galliard preparatiues of
Phillip, found himself no less astonished to see he was taken at a lift, than
perplexed through the difficulty, whereof report was made unto him, of
finding finances to levy, conduct, furnish, and employ so gross an army
withal. Which to hinder the enterie and sack of his realm to so puissant a
neighbor and ancient enemy, was a matter necessary for the richest and
poorest Prince of Christendom, (thorough the abundance, and yet evil
husbanding of his means) in making ready the preparatiues, whereof he knew a
great deal better the difficulties which presented themselves to the
executions of his haughty desseignes, by the complaints which all the estates
of his Realm made to be resounded on all parts, as soon as the brute of
another war refreshed their memory with remembrance of so many sorrows
passed.

Two houses at this time possessed king Henry more than any other of his
realm, that of Guise and Monmorencie, both of them recommended for the
antiquity, valor, and renown of their races, virtuously employed to the
profit and honor of the crown of France. But that being the greater, better
allied, richer, and of more renown throughout all Christendom, would not
acknowledge the Monmorencian equal to itself, saving in the favor of the
Prince, whose grace toward the Constable mounted so far, as that he would
conceal nothing from him, do all things by his advise, and vouchsafe him
sometimes to be his bedfellow, the honor and respect being kept still such
as he ought. So as being set in authority, thorough the credit and
exceeding virtue, as well of his four sons, as of his three nephews of
Chastillon, and other his kinsmen, who bare honorable offices, all of them
within the realm, he seemed to have no need of desiring the increase of
ought, but only a continuance of his greatness, provided that no disaster did
cross the course of so happy a pursuit. Those of Guise no less supported by
the merit of their own valor, and put in authority thorough the ancient
renown of so many princes, issued out of the house of Lorraine, sought to make
themselves greatest in the kings favor, by a far greater number of signal
services with Charles and Frances of Guise, might do to the flower de Luce. So
as, as well to continue their own duty, as their ancestors and fathers,
they had undertaken the voyage of Italy, to the end to deliver Pope Iulie out
of the Spaniardes hands: and if promise should be kept with them, to employ
them selves to the conquest of the kingdom of Naples, hoping by that means
much more to extol the kings power and credit among foreign nations* Charles
and De Guise Cardinals remaining only behind in Court to entertain the king
to the conduct of such a dessein. Which likewise was greatly favored by Diane
de Poitiers, sole heir to S. Valier, Duke of Valentinois, who to imploie
thereto that part of her credit, which her beauty, comely carriage, and
quickness of spirit (graces hateful enough to the virtuous Katherine de
Medices Queen of France) had gained unto her of the king, had given one of her
daughters in marriage to De Guise Earl of Aumaule, who accompanied the Duke
his brother into Italy. Now as all greatness stands accompanied with the
passions of the Court, upon the preparatiues which king Phillip made daily, to
be revenged of the losses abouesayd, men began to show unto the king the damage
and dishonor, which thorough the absence of his forces, the breach of truce so
solemnly sworn would bring unto him: how the Duke of Guise had spent one
hundred and three score thousand crowns a month, without having done ought
else than seen Ciuitelle, a frontire town of Naples the small, or rather no
advantage at all, which he had received by the breach thereof. How that the
king of Spain being well settled in his quarters within Italy, had assembled
together such forces, as it was an easy matter for him to advance the ruin of
France, if he should enter in against so few people as were to present
themselves unto him, in the rank of whom, notwithstanding the Constable
humbly besought his majesty to place him, that he might imploie therein,
together with his own means, the life of himself, his kinsmen, friends, and
such other as would follow him in such an enterprise, as much perforced and
vncommodious as it was. The king greatly bewailed such an accident: but as he
was one of the best princes and most easy to be managed, as France ever saw,
he did not greatly torment himself, thorough the hope which the Cardinal of
Lorraine and the Duchess of Valentinois had given unto him. How the whole
matter could not but receue an happy issue, and how that the Constable, chief
of arms, might assemble men enough to make head to the Spaniard, if it would
please his majesty but to send him toward the frontires, there to make
ready the camp. The which he was commanded to do. So as he departed from
Compeigne, (where the king as then lay governed by those of Guise) with speed
enough to go to Nostre dame de Liesse, there to receive his troops together,
which should be sent unto him out of all parts. In the mean time they
studied upon all means (the kings treasure being already drawn dry) how to
procure money for the entertaining of such an army, in which appeared great
difficulties, accompanied with grievous complaints in many places. In sum,
besides the great and ordinary impostes which were levied upon the people, new
taxes and particular loanes were put upon them, with surcharges so excessive,
as they grew intolerable upon the third estate, which the continuance of the
wars had already eaten almost to the bare bones. The ministers and beneficed
men of the Church; albeit they alleged how that they were exempt, and
privileged from such charges, were never a whit spared, but seized according
to their tenths, to the utmost value of the revenue of their Benefices. The
Nobility but even freshly returned from the wars passed, with a hope of a
good repose, to help up themselves again, settle order in their houses, and
establish their revenues to come, was again called, as well to appear in the
Rirebandes, as to inroll themselves in the kings ordinances, who dispatched
commissions to leauie new companies, and to fill up the old. The Ringraue
bringing unto him one thousand Pistolliers, and eight hundred Lansknets, came
to join with his forces. In the mean space to prevent the first desseines of
his enemy, to favor the advancement of the fortifications upon the frontiers,
and whilst that the army was making ready, at the end of January, 1557. the
rest of the men at arms of France, were sent as the most ready force which the
king had, to be divided among the most dangerous frontires, especially in
Campaign. For that the imperials ordinaryly made their descent most that ways,
and to favor the fortification of Rocroy, which served as a counterfort and
support to Mariembourg and Maubert Fontaine. Fortifying in like sort, and
munitioning the rest of the places upon the frontire, they repaired up again
the platform and pan of the wall behind the castle of Mezieres, which was
much fallen down. The spring notwithstanding and most part of the Summer
passed over, without any matter worthy of memory, saving the attempt of
certain of the garrisons upon Roc Roy, which I will show unto you. After having
represented the place to the natural. Roc Roy and his representation.
It is a barren soil more than two leagues round about it, where you can see
nothing but high woods, standing water, and marrishes, especially in the wast
and unmanured places grows nothing but briers, thorns, broom, and heath, for
that the molde thereof is clay: the plains and bottomes all moorish where the
fort stands. The rest of the places are hard and sharp rocks, without any
moisture or bearing of fruit, saving catmint and moss, which makes it far
unfit for the incamping of an army, by means of the seat and barrennes of
the place. The fort has five frontes, which they term in form of Pantagone,
covered and defended with four great bulwarks, garnished with their flankers,
Cazamates, and platformes: then the old fort which serves for the fifth, each
carrying his particular name, so great and spacious, that every one may lodge
two thousand soldiers, and a great deal of artillery. A matter very
commodious for the retrenches and rampires against the enemy.

Moreover, the defenses there are so surely covered, and without any danger
of battery, that it is very uneasy to take them away: joint that the heels
and shoulders thereof are so large and thick, that they cover a great part of
the Courtines. And for the better enduring of the rampire, the turfe and the
earth is so claie and slammie, as if it soake in never so little water, it
stiffneth and hardneth enough of it self. Therefore the fourth of April the
imperial garrisons being assembled together, marched so secretly to break
down the bank, which as yet was reared but two foot high, as thinking that
the most part of the soldiers would sallie out upon their curriors, with
resolution to cut off their way, and so hew them in pieces. Then (together
with such as fled to enter pesle mesle within the forte) they saw the
soldiers even and anon sallying out file a file to the skirmish, against the
first, as the indiscreet heat of the French does always carry. But the whole
company coming upon them to cut off their retreat, the rest which were
within the forte in arms, to make the view and deal the last, issued forth so
readily, and with such resolute charges, as the other were constrained to draw
back and retire themselves in the end, to defend themselves from the number of
Cannon shot which played upon them with out ceasing.

Passing over thus some time in these light attempts, the seventh of June the
Queen of England sent an Heralde of arms to proclaim war unto the king,
who, the king having made it be declared unto him by the Constable, how
graciouslye he used him, in respect of the punishment which he deserved, in
that he had passed thorough his realm without safe conduct, was courteously
sent back with presents, and his answer: which was, how he accepted of the
defiance, in hope to make her know, that without any occasion at all she had
offered this unto him, considering the good offices which had passed as well
from himself as his ancestors toward her and her nation.

Likewise it was sufficiently enough apparent, how that she had been as it
were importuned heereunto by her husband, in respect of the divisions and
partialities of that Realm, as well between the English and the Spaniardes,
as among the English themselves. The most part imagining how that their new
king, diminishing their forces and means by such wars, would seek the more
easily to make himself master of their fortresses, and usurp the
superintendance, which he so much longed after, to manage all things at his
own will and pleasure. You shall elsewhere see what insued hereupon. In July
the Prince of Piemont, Almora Earl of Eguemond, the Duke of Ascot, and others,
prepared an army at Giuets, curious to perform the matter better than they
did at the first attempt. Which they had assembled together for to have
surprised Rocroy, at the very first push. But their vant curriers were so
lustily set upon by those which issued out to the skirmish, as the gross
coming to assist and support them after a long meley of hot buckling together,
and infinite Cannon shot which rained among them, was constrained in the end to
leave a great number of their dead behind in the field, whilst they turned
upon the frontire of Picardie, K. Phillips army.
as if they had meant to have attempted upon Guise, before which the whole
imperial army lay of thirty five thousand men, and twelve thousand horse,
tarrying for eight thousand Englishmen: who landing at Calis and in the County
Doye, K. Henry's army.
was to join with them at Saint Quentines. King Henry his army assembled it
self at the same time at Atygnie. But as their foresight was not so great as
the Spanish, no more was their number, nor their means found to be alike.
There might be about eighteen thousand fantassins of Almanes and French, five
or six thousand horse, of light men at arms, as well French as Almaine,
coasting always notwithstanding the imperials within four or five leagues
following, the Country of Tierasche, resolved to close themselves within
Pierre Ponte, a place very commodious to ouerrun the whole frontire, and there
to distribute succors among the garrisons, with surety of those troops which
should keep the field.

The advantage which grew unto the imperials thorough their long foresight, The
aduauntages which the Spaniards and Flemings had over the French.
having brought forth unto them so strong an army, and the variable and
diligent dismarch of their troops, caused that the French being insolent, and
contemning the enemies forces, (against whom ordinarily they esteemed it
enough to prepare them selves upon the blow and intelligence which presented it
self) did in no sort provide to withstand the enterprise of Phillip, and
being at the very pinch uncertain of his intent, they were not able to judge
by the deportments of his army to what place he meant, whereby they might
furnish it as were necessary. So as first the Kings council, and afterward
the Constables, being divided into two parts, some thought that the Prince of
Piemont would undertake naught else, and turned to no other end than to make an
honorable retreat. For that not having been able to assemble his army
together so soon as he imagined, through the distance of so many diverse
countries, as he was to draw his men out of, and other discommodities, the
opportunity was escaped him, far attempting any matter of great importance.
Especially for that he was repulsed from the Frontier of Champaigne, whither
they said his principal entente was. And albeit that other were of a
contrary opinion, assuring how there was a certain complotte, an assured
Rende-vous, and a full foresight determined, whither he meant to turn his
Forces, as unto a matter which he held already half conquered, being well
advertised of such want, as there might be, so far, as the Admiral did
assure, (by intelligence received) the Conestable his Uncle, how that the
Prince meant to have a blow at Picardie, as a place very evil provided. Joint
that the Spanishe bands which were within new Hedin, (the best Troops which
they had) were not as yet dislodged: the French, (as men's senses being
dispersed do less apprehende one of those things which they do behold, then
if they were all fixed upon that alone) being curious to furnishe the whole,
provided not sufficiently either for the army, or any other of those places,
whereby they might stay the enemy, who still entertained them with his long
delays, and irresolutions, thorough the uncertainty of his dissein, until
that the Prince, having made a show, as though he would first encampe before
Guise, then at Mariembourg, had enclosed round S. Quentins with his light
Cauallerie. S. Quentin environed round before that the French once thought
thereof and less provided for it.
And at the same instant causing his whole army to martche with extreme
diligence, he found himself encamped round about it, before that ever he
could be thought to have been half way. The suddenness whereof made the
whole Camp to doubt least the place would be taken by surprise, as well for
want of men, as other provisions and fortifications within the Town, which
had but the Captain Brueil for governor, and Telligny, Lieutenaunt to the
Daulphin, of a Company of one hundred men at arms: the better part of whom
were therein Garrison, at which the Inhabitauntes grew so greatly
discontented, considering as they alleged, that their privileges did exempte
the^ from them, as whatsoever ensued thereupon, was rather attributed to their
own fault then to any others. The Admiral, being commanded by the
Conestable, to get into the Town with as many men as he should be able,
under a hope of being succored by him: Gaspard Coligny Admiral and Governor
of Piccardie gets into S. Quentin.
albeit that Iarnac and Lusarche offered themselves to go thither, and keep
him from aduenturing so great a danger, persuading him to employ himself
somewhere else, where he should be able to do the King more signal service,
then to cast away himself there within, did so much notwithstanding, as with
four hundred and fifty men, as well horse as foot, he entered in. Afterward
having made the Round about the walls, encouraged the Inhabitauntes: whom he
assembled together in the common Hall, visited the whole Town thorough,
ouerlooked the provisions and munitions of war, and given the quarters unto
Companies, he provided for all the rest the best which he was able. Now for
that Julian Romero, and Carondelet spanish Captains had already gained the
bulwark of Fauxbourg d'Isle, where they had settled their Enseignes,
notwithstanding any resistaunce which could be made. Iointe that it was without
parapette, and the earth without as high as within, the Admiral issued out to
regayne it, and to burn the houses about. But the besieged were so evil
received, and hottely pursued, as many returned hurt, counselling the Admiral
to abandon that Fauxbourg, considering the small number of men which he had,
and the two passages to the Flankers thereof, by which the enemy might cut
between the Fauxbourg and the Town, and so hinder the retreat of such as
should defend it. But he would needs still hold it until a greater
occasion were offered, to set a good countenance upon it. Hereupon being
willing to view the encamping of his enemies, he commanded Teligny, to cause
50. horse of his Company to fallie out under the conducte of some assured man
at arms, only to view, How a sallie ought to be made upon the enemy.
enioyning them by no means to sight, and especially, that he should not go
himself: But seeing the Couriers engaged, and in disorder, he was no sooner
advanced without armor, and upon a bad court all to cause them to retire, but
he was wrapped in, thrown down to the ground, wounded to death, stripte
naked, and afterward carried away by a soldier, who hazzarded his life, for
the reward, which the Admiral had promised unto him. This done, perceiving
the preparratiues of the enemy to batter the Fauxbourg d'Isle, having carried
away whatsoever was portable, and provided for the burning of the houses upon
the watch word given, he quitted it, and caused the whole to be burned. Now
as the Inhabitants had hid their provisions, notwithstanding any
commandment or diligence used to forbid them, (among whom the Mayor aloane
and the Sire de Gibercourte, were noted to do their duty) so their fault in
concealing the powder, which had lain a long time hid in the Towers of the
gate of the Fauxbourg d'Isle, was a cause of great inconvenience. For to the
end they might carry it away, as soon as it was discovered, the cakes being
all rotten and mouldering into pieces, they were feign to put it into
blankettes, where the fire took so at unawares, with such violence, of this
diuelishe mixtion, as it made a breach of more then five and thirty paces,
Gunpowder.
besides the loss of six and thirty serviceable men, which went all into
smoke. Whereupon the enemy had a fair occasion presented to undertake some
thing to his advantage, if the fire of the houses of the Fauxbourg which
burned, had not taken away the sight of this breach from the Spanyardes, who
might easily have entered in at the beginning, for that every man was retired
to feed, and other necessaries. And albeit that the Conestable greatly payned
himself, to get succor into the Town, according to the advice, which he had
received from the Admiral, who to this end had sent forth Vaupergue, and
from the top of a steeple had showed him by what ways they were to take
their course, yet Dandelot his brother was not able to bring any in, for that
certain Englishemen prisoners among the Spanyardes, had advertised them of
this enterprise. An occasion that having entrenched and furnished the high way
to Han, by which they were to pass with harquebusiers, (for so much as that
quarter being allotted to such Englishmen as were joined unto King Philips
Army, was less peopled with men of war) the third part was there slain,

and the rest enforced to save themselves, albeit they had a number of men at
arms and light horse to assiste them with hot alarmes, whilst that they
should enter in: In the mean space to view the Country, and to hinder the
enemy from enlarging himself, attempting upon him as occasions were
proffered. But Vaupergue, had not sufficiently marked the places which were
showed unto him for his entrance in, but gave straight upon a Corpse de guarde
of Fantassins, in stead of passing between it, and one other of Cauallerie.
Where he should have found nothing but Sentinels, and have been able to gain
a little hill, all alongest the Vines, by which the Captain S. Andre had
entered in by fair day light. An occasion that the Admiral had now enough to
do, to encourage the besieged, assuring them that the Conestable would not
suffer them to be lost within, and that together with himself, so many
Gentlemen would not tarry there if they supposed they should be but lost. It
was about this time, that nine thousand Englishmen, and 1500. horse,
Englishmen joined to K. Philips Army.
arrived at the camp under the charge of the Earl of Penbrooke, Clinton, and
Gray, lodged as I before told you. In the mean time the Admiral caused 700.
idle months to be put cut, to ease the town so much in favor of the
voluntary men. The Prince even as soon made his trenches, and aproches against
the port of Romicourt, under the favor of the hedges and trees, which had not
been before cut up by the beseeged. Whereof the Admiral advertised the
Constable, and of the marish, by which way only they were then able to succor
them: promising to rampire and fill up certain little deep channels, which
hindered their passage. The which he did by the Captain S. Romain: and to
cross the River which runs through and ouerfloweth this marish: they caused
four boats to be brought, upon which, being chained together, and reaching
from the one shore to the other, they might well have passed, if they had
been able to land on the bank, whilst that a hot alarm were given to the
whole camp. Upon which the Constable being resolved, he departed the 8. of
August from La Fere, with two thousand horse, four thousand Fantassins, as
well Almaines as French, trayning four field pieces alongest. Being arrived
over against the village called Le grand Essigny: he made a stand, and taking
the D. of Neuers, the Prince of Conde, and some others, he aproched as near as
he was able to S. Quentin, as far as the descent of the marish without
discovering any enemy. Afterward he sent Du Fumett to view nearer, and make
report of the distance of the enemy from the town, and of the marish from
them, together with the largenes of the river. The which he did, with two other
more, who agreed somewhat with his report: whereupon on S. Laurence day in the
morning the tenth of the month, there were set in battle, at the place of
execution near La Fere sixteen French ensigns, and two and twenty Almaine
with fifteen pieces of artillarie, whither the whole cauallerie came to join
with them. Then they advanced as far as S. Quentines by nine of the clock
right to the fauxbourge de Lisle on the side of fourteen Spanish Ensigns,
where the whole was set in order of battle. On the side beyond the water, and
the marish, was the Prince of Piemont and his army, far stretched forth, having
for sentinel, within a mile on this side, two Spanish Ensigns, which were
suddenly turned down and constrained to retire themselves beyond the causey.
At the same instant the french artillery thundered so furiously upon the Camp,
and especially into the Princes Tent, as he had no leisure to put on his
armor, to retire himself into the next quarter of the Count of Aiguemont: to
whom every man retired in a strange disorder. Now for that they doubted a
certain dangerous passage, distant about one league from Fauxbourg d'isle,
(where the french Cauallery lay) they sent thither a cornet of the Renigraues
pistoliers, to the end to have news sooner by them, then footmen, which were
rather like to be lost then succored, as also that they were the more easily
able to retire. And for a greater strength the D. of Neuers went thither with
three companies of men at arms. Upon this the Constable used all means to
make his men to enter in: but the boats not being able to come to the other
shore, through the abundance of the soldiers, which entered in by such heaps,
and disorderly, were so ouerladen, as by reason of the durte and ouse in which
they stooke, it was impossible for any great number of men to pass over:
besides at the going out of the boats, the press of the soldiers was such as
they were not able to follow the ways and paths showed unto them. An occasion
that they scattered* and fell into the deep ditches of the marish, whence they
were not able to get out, but remained there all mirie, and the most part
drowned miserably.

The Prince of Pimont resalueth to charge, to hinder the rest from entering in,
or to break the French Army.
The Prince in the mean space having taken resolution to charge upon so few men
before the appointed succors were al entered in, the artillarie ceasing to
annoy them, any further, caused the Compte of Aiguemont to pass over the
passage with two thousand horse, which the French durst not encounter
withal, and then two other Companies followed after with Battailions of foot,
during whose passages, some gave counsel to the Conestable to charge upon them
which were already passed over. But their advice prevailed, who rather
counseled a retreat, then to advance further with so few men, considering
the furious dismartche of their enemies: Ioynte that he was not come thither
to hazzarde the Forces of France, except that he were greatly constrained
thereunto. And further how he had succored and furnished Saint Quintin with
all necessaries, as he thought in spite of the enemy. Thus the Duke of
Neuers retired to Louys de Bourbon Prince of Conde, who had the charge of
certain light Cauallerie, which the Conestable had caused to tarry at a
Windemille. With whom being joined, and keeping the left winge, they came
safe and sound unto the Conestable, who always gained ground of the
retreat, whilst that his enemies increasing, advanced forwards, and had
already gotten advantage of him, in eighte great battailions of Cauallerie
and Reistres. Yea, they viewed him so near, as the Conestable imagining that
he had well enough provided for the place, and that by the temporising of his
enemies, they would not dare to come back upon him, made no other accounte,
then softely to retire. The which the enemy attributing in the beginning to an
assured resolution of Combatte, showed himself uncertain of the charge,

(following the Wars for their pleasure, or profit) to retire apace, to save
themselves, with their money and marchandises, from an enemy so near unto
them, and afterward the servants, whom they caused to bate to retire, all
which changing their pace to a galloppe, astonyed at the retreat of these
merchants, retired themselves with great cries, witnesses of the fear which
had already possessed them, it made the Compte of Aiguemont to think, who
suddaynely caused the Prince to be advertised thereof, that the French Army
quaked, and that it was now time to try their fortune, and to charge upon
such an advantage. In the end, this Flemmishe Compte, having after he had
received commandment from the Prince, conferred a while with the Chief men
which accompanied him, leaving the Compte of Saint Cheualsbourg, with his
Regiment of Reistres to keep the passage, charged thorough a Flancke with two
thousand horse, at the same time as the Earls Henry and Eruest of Brunswich,
each followed with one thousand Reistres, backed and encouraged by the Compte
of Horn, with a thousand men at arms of the ordinances of the Country,
set all as it were with one trotte upon the other Flancke, at the very same
instaunte, as the Earls of Maunsfielde, Vuilen, Dostrat, and of Geldres with
other three thousand horse, threw under foot the midst with such a fury,
as having overthrown the first Ranckes, and those which seconded them, all the
surplus was put to flight.

and afterward remounted, was slain at the second Charge, and in the end
being brought unto the Prince, he caused him to be carried with all honor to
be buried at La Fere.

Frauncis de la Tour, Vicompte of Turaine, S. Gelais, and more then six
hundred Gentlemen dyed there, with four thousand as well French as Almaine

was retired to La Fere, Espeuilles, Enseigne to his men at arms, gave his
colors to Chazeilles to save it. And his Guidon S. Simon being overthrown,
had been taken prisoner, if D' Auerly had not slain him which carried him.
The Conestable sore wounded in the haunche, was carried away prisoner, and so
was the Duke of Montpensier. As also the Mareschall S. Andre, Ludouic Prince of
Mantoue, the Reingraue, Roche-foucat, S. Heron, Frenchmen dead, prisoners and

Bordillon, Mouy, Montsales, and many other of name. As soon as the Fanterie
perceived this disorder, it set it self in square battailions, but being
ouerthrown, resisted no whit at all. So as many lying bleeding, and dead upon
the ground, the rest were led away prisoners by troops like muttons. Who at
the coming of King Philip were presented unto him, with their weapons and
colors, in triumph of so great and signal a Victory, happened between
Essigny and Rizerolles. Being pursued by the space of four hours, until
evening, from the Blanc-fosse where the slaughter began, unto the gallows
distaunt one league from La Fere, where two pieces of Artillery only were
recovered: the which Bordillon went afterward to fetch, to carry them to La
Fere, where the Duke of Neuers, Chief of the rest, the Prince of Conde, the
Compte of Sancerre, Bordillon and other saved them selves. And shortly after
such as were escaped from the Combatte, and out of prison, retired themselves
in far greater number then was hoped for. But stripped of all they had.

The Duke of Neuers Chief of such as escaped, reassembleth the rest of the
battle, and how he provided for the whole.
This done, the Duke of Neuers sent round about, to make it known unto the
dispersed sort, how that the Rende-vous of the Army was appointed at Laon,
Where he assured them that they should receive their pay, which they had not
seen of many months together. This done, having furnished the Frontires with
men and munitions the best which he was able, he advertised the King of the
estate wherein his affairs stood, and besought the Prince of Piemont, to
send unto him the number roll of such prisoners of mark as were taken. Then
together with the Prince of Conde he retired within Laon, with six hundred
horse the residue of all the Troops. He left Bordillon at La Fere, and the
Compte of Sancerre at Guise. Afterward the King sent De Pot to Han, and De
Lorges to Noyon, there to assemble together the Gentlemen of his house, and the
Archers of his guards, and to provide for those quarters, according as need
should require.

Paris scareth the coming of K. Philip no less then before time his fathers
Charles the Emperor.
Hereupon the King retired himself from Compienne to Paris, thereby to assure
the Inhabitauntes, who already quaked, seeking to retire themselves, with the
more precious part of their goods, and moueables, into the furthest parts of
the Realm. To whom first he sent the Queen, who was quickly at the Guilde
hall, where she demanded, and obtained a grant of three hundred thousand
livers, after an Oration made by the Cardinal Bertrande, Archbishop of Sens,
Lord Keeper. Who in sum declared unto them.

How that the Lord God, having chosen and appointed him for their King, by
like means had created and left unto him, a heart and affection to rule
them, preserve and defend them, even to the aduenturing of his own life:
Therefore that they should assure themselves, that he would no more abandon
them, then that he had this firm belief, how the divine Grace would never
fail him, to which if it has seemed good to send unto him this misfortune,
it was an admonition, to acknowledge the Almighty, who distributeth all
things according to his good pleasure as well to great as small. The K.
demands succor of the Parissians.
Now, albeit that he received it as a punishment and chastiseme^t for his
offenses, or it might be his Peoples, yet the danger was not so great and
inevitable, but that means were left of remedy, considering the succors,
which they are to seek of the God of Victories. And that of themselves they
would be an aid unto themselves, and especially to him in this desperate
necessity, Whereupon they had to consider, that so long as the rentes of his
reuennewe, were able to streatche out toward the maintenance of these wars,
he had not importuned them, by surcharges of demaundes, and redoublementes of
taskes, or other contributions: But that he was always willing, rather to
sell and morgage his own Demayne, exchange and borrowe elsewhere, then to
fleece or moleste them. But since that now he was no longer able to satisfy
them, thorough the affairs which daily redoubled upon him, as they might see
and perceive with their own eyes, therefore he besought them that they would
succor him only with money, and that for the rest they would rely
themselves upon him, who of his part would never fail them in will, and good
affection, nor yet in force or power to succor them, or in any thing else
which might appertain to the authority or Estate of a King toward his
subjects.

Briefly the Parissians reacknowledging the good zeal of their Prince,
accorded willingly unto him three hundred thousand livers, as also the rest of
the capital Cities of the Provinces, contributed as their ability stretched.
With the which he sent into Zwizerlande, to levy six thousand men, under the
Colonel Luc Reistre of Basle, and on the other side eight thousand under
Claris de Haris. Likewise he sent the Colonel Rechrod, to make an other levy
of Almaine footmen. Albeit that the Country was much unfurnished thorough the
leuies of King Phillip, and of another which the Baron of Poleuille made there
of twenty Ensigns, and certain Reistres. Besides this, the King sent word
unto the Duke of Guise, by Scipion his escuyer, how he should settle all
things in Italy, to the most advantage which he were able, The means which
the K. of France used for his better assurance after the battle of S.
Quentin.
and withdraw his Forces hitherwards. In the mean time it was ordered that
general musters should be made of the Inhabitants of Paris, over whom there
commanded Charles de Bourbon, Prince De la Roche-Suryon in Poitou. This done,
the King being shortly after arrived from Compienne, general processions were
made, whither likewise Paul de Terms was sent for, for the reputation of his
virtue, especially in feats of Arms. Who being come, caused to be broken off,
that unprofitable device, of the long trenches, which they had begun at Paris
on the side of Mont-martre, the better to assure that passage. In the end
proclamation was made in the Kings name, thorough out all the Countries, that
all soldiers, Gentlemen, or other, which either had followed, or were able to
carry arms, should retire to Laon, toward the D. of Neuers, his Lieutenaunt
general, to the end they might be there employed for his service, and
safety of the Country. And that all such as would follow the wars for
their own pleasure, should retire themselves about his person, under pain
of being declared Rebels, punished corporally as villains, and disgraded of
all Nobility.

Such an accident was soon enough able to change the affairs of the Court.
Yea, to establishe an other kind of form altogether, in the managing of the
Estate of France, over which the Conestable seemed to hold the advantage. But
his taking caused it to fall into the hands of the Cardinal of Lorraine, and
Duchess of Valentinois, who kept it for the Duke of Guise, as soon as he
should be come to the Court. During the attendance of whose Forces, the Duke
of Neuers assembling together such as were escaped from the battle, and as
many more as he was able, gave forth a number of Commissions to Levy in the
Kings name, new Companies, and sent De iours to fetch the Leagion of
Champagne, whereof he had been chief Captain, and drew five Enseignes out
of the Garrison of Metz, and other old bands of the Garrisons near hand, in
whose stead he sent new, not ceasing to send forth men of all hands to
view, learn news, and upon any good intelligence, to charge at their
advantage. In the mean space the Prince of Conde suffered no more the enemy
to repose himself, then the light horse as also did the Earls of Sancerre and
Bordillon of their part. And albeit that the Captain Graye his English light
horse, The English which served K. Henry gained by those of Philips side,
leave their Captain and fly.
having quitted him, and carried away his armor and horse, gave occasion to
the enemy to send two thousand horse as far as Oyse, to pass over there,
and stop these Couriers, yet durst they not for all that venture any further,
but returned to the Camp, having found the French watchful at all hands,
as disgrace awakeneth and keeps all kind of persons within their duty,
more then prosperity, or any other accident.

To return to the Mareschall Brissac his actions in Piemont, whilst that he
employed his army, in attending the effect of the long promises, which had
been made him of his pay, to waste the Country round about Fossan, block in
Cony, and hindering them both from having any succoures, especially of
victualles or other necessaries, De Lambres, an ordinary groom of the Kings
Chamber, was dispatched unto him, on the 15. of August, to advertise him of the
defeat, and taking of the Conestable, Defeat of S. Quentins. De Terms and De
Anuille.
under Saint Quentins, and of the continuance of the Siege thereof. And further
carried a commandment unto him, to send away thither out of hand, De
Terms, and D'Anuille, with their Companies, and the Regiment of Swizers which
were in Piemont, the better to further the affairs of the Realm. Whereupon a
Counsel was held, at Lagasque, and therein it was resolved that they should
depart with their Companies. And how that in regard of the Swizers, and other
affairs which as then fell out, the Secretary Bounin should be dispatched,
with charge to condole with his Majesty, for so great a loss, and disastre on
the behalf of all his servants in Piemont. And further most humbly to
deliver unto him, what their opinion and advise was, for the preventing of such
inconveniences, as might grow by such an accident: The substance whereof was
how his Majesty should himself embrace the conducte of his affairs, and
command a Levy forthwith to be made, of twenty thousand Almaines, and
thirty thousand French, with correspondent Forces of Cauallerie. And that
this army might be on foot, before such time as the enemy should have
taken Saint Quentins, or at the least assailed, taken, and fortified any other
place, That to be able to restore all things into good terms, and for a long
time to entertain the said Army, it were necessary to make a good provision
of money, taking up to that end, an whole years reuennewe of the
Bishoprics, Abbayes, and other benefices, without excepting any, saving such
as still trauayled, and spente their own about his Majesty. Who might, if it
pleased him, begin with the Bishop of Constance, Cousin to the said
Mareschall. The K. means to draw out of the Cleargies and Nobilities
reuennewes.
Who likewise was of advise, that the Estates should be assembled, and that
his Majesty in person should deliver the necessity of his affairs, and
demand succor therein. And that all that, which might be so drawn out, was
not able to supply the want: That he should in the like sort help himself
by the Nobility, beginning with him, taking all his reuennewes, saving two
thousand livers, which might be left to his wife, to nourishe her self and
her children withal. That the Swizers should make themselves ready to
martch, albeit that they were so tired, and near driven of all hands, by
being evil paid, as that they would hardly be able to be arrived within
France, before that the occasion for which his M. sought them were passed
over. And that by this means Piemont without cause would remain unarmed, and
in great danger: besides the loss of time and expense, which had been
employed and bestowed upon the bringing of the said Fossan and Cony into that
extreme necessities in which they then stood. But at the second summons of
his Majesty, the Swizers must of necessity be sent away, The Swizers go out
of Piemont
who as it was foretold grew altogether unprofitable, thorough the long
aboade which they made at Lions, being very sick, weak, and evil paid.

Now the Mareschall having understood that upon this defeat his Majesty had
caused new Companies of men at arms to be addressed, he greatly besought for
La Mothe Gondrin, Francisque Bernardrin de Pauan, and Vicompt Gourdon, but they
might not be gratified. He offered for all that to come in person himself
unto his Majesty, in this his great necessity to do him service, but it
would not be accepted.

Certain days after his Majesty perceiving how few Forces were remaining in
Piemont, the Swizers being departed thence, and foreseeing the danger of some
inconvenience like to ensue, sent word unto the Mareschall, that in stead of
those Swizers, he should with all speed levy new Companies of foot, and
that he should want no money to that end. Notwithstanding there was only
sent to pay the old bands, which were in extreme necessity, many months
having been due unto them: Yea, and in stead of remedying the necessities of
Piemont, his Majesty's pleasure was, to accept the offer, which unwitting to
the Mareschall was made unto him by the Vidasme of Chartres, Colonel of the
Infanterie, The Vidasme of Chartres carries 2000. Fantassins into France.
for carrying into France from thence two thousand French harquebusiers, and
as many Italians. Which being accordingly put in execution, it was altogether
apparaunt, that thereby his Majesty's affairs were put into extreme peril
and ruin, the enemies being strong, and the French feeble, ill paid, and
coming so lately from receiving the desastre of the defeat of the Army, and
loss of Saint Quentins.

As the time thus passed away, with very small advantage to the Kings
affairs, the President Baillif, made offer unto the King of himself, and
unwitting to the Mareschall, that he might levy in Piemont, two or three
hundred thousand crowns, leuying three crowns upon every householder, which
offer was not only accepted without any advise at all demanded of the
Mareschall, but there was likewise priest money delivered unto him upon the
assignations of Piemont. And whilst that his Majesty made difficulty to
hear such reasons as might be alleged touching the impossibility of such
a levy, there was no provision made for succor of men, nor money, in so much
as many losses and inconveniences were ready to ensue: Especially for that the
Vidasme still pursued the execution of his Levy of two thousand harquebusiers.

For if any man would have constrained the bands of Piemont, to muster
without pay, it was to be feared that it would have happened worse then it did
at Cony. The more likely, considering in what unfavorable terms, his
Majesty's affairs as then stood. Who might very well have called to mind
how diverse and sundry times word was sent unto him, that the prolonging of
the Musters, was only wrought and occasioned, by the delay of the money, the
want whereof rendered the soldiers poor, and made them disobedient, and an
euidente loss to the finances of his Majesty, which notwithstanding they
cold by no means remedy, without having means to make a rigorous muster.
All things being thus conducted in this sort, and the death of Salueson
happening governor of Casal: his Majesty as he was accustomed to do in like
vacances, never tarying for the advice and nomination of the Marshall, Death of
Salueson.
placed Francisque Bernardin therein, fayning as though he had understood that
he and not La motte Gondrin had been put into Casal after the death of
Salueson. Francisque Bernardin Governor of Casal.
And albeit that his Majesty did afterward revoke this nomination, yet
matters were in such sort handeled as Francisque Bernardin still stomached the
Marshal the rather for that at his return from the Court into Piemont, he was
not gratefied nor honored in such sort as he expected: he recommended
likewise Mont basin to have the place of gentleman of the chamber which
Salueson before had. Salueson gentleman of the Chamber.
But he was not able to obtain it, so as he, and many other of the Kings
servants, seeing how little credit was given to the Marshals recommendations,
albeit they were for men of merit began to diminish their affection, and some
of them to ask leave to depart homewardes to follow their advancement,
alleging that none but such as went to the court were advanced and
recompensed. Thus upon these occasions, The credit of a Governor is impared
among his own except it appear somewhat about his sovereign.
began many complaints, disobediences and quarrels to arise, which
notwithstanding received an other kind of construction then this: so as being
enforced thereunto the twenty and eight of September, he let the King to
understand how many Captains, gentlemen, and other officers daily departed
away without leave as well for want of pay, as that they perceived right well,
how they should never receive any preferment, through his recommendation: among
whom Pauan had for this occasion quitted and given over his Lieuetenancie:
Pauan, Baron of Adrek, Bouual de part.
and the Baron of Ardrets, the Captain Bouuall, Sergent Mayor of Casal, and
sundry other personages who had long and faithfully served. But notwithstanding
he made light account thereof, so as every man began to seek an other
supporte then his, and to perke up the nose against him. Now as his Majesty
stood advertised how that the enemies had levied great companies of resolute
men in readiness after the coming of the D. of Alua, The D. of Alua comes in
Piemont with his army.
(whom they attended within few days at Gennes with the forces of the
kingdom of Naples) to assail either Piemonte, or the D. of Ferrara, (who for
that cause had made great instance, that his Majesty's forces might approach to
the D. of Milan) the Marshall besought him to provide thereto as well with
force, as money: to the end he might prevent in time and place, such
inconveniences, which a man might perceive prepared as well on the one side as
the other. And for so much as his majesty had made semblance to mislike the
difficulty which the Marshal made upon the leuy of two thousand
Harquebusiers, who^ the Vidasme offered to bring into France, dispatching the
eighteen the Secretary Bounin, for instance of supply and provision of
money, he gave him in charge to declare unto his said Majesty that whatsoever
he had done was not with any intention to contrary his will, but for so much as
his Majesty had not as then countermand (as he had done since the thirteenth)
the Ensigns of the Zuizers, who not returning back, and the said two
thousand Harquebusiers going away, there was small likelihood. But Piemont
would remain altogether at the enemies discreation. And when as this
consideration could not prevail. Yet he said that he had otherwise occasion
enough to remain evil satisfied, seeing that such an offer had been made
without ever communicating the same unto him, and afterward accepted without
ever demanding his advise, The Mareshal (...) content.
as it seemed reasonable, since that he governed Piemont the principal charge
whereof it pleased his Majesty to bestow upon him. Notwithstanding he ceased
not all things laid by, rather to favor then hinder the Vidasme. And as it
was given him in charge at the same time, to levy, according to the
proposition made by the Presidente Bailly, Money levied upon Piemont.
three crowns of tax upon every householder, whereof his Majesty made full
accounte, without demanding his advise at all therein, yet resting only upon
the service of his Majesty, he did so much, as that he leuyed upon the
Country six score thousand livers, wherewith he relieved himself, attending
better provision. Upon which levy, what fair words soever or amiablenesse he
could use, many inconveniences were ready to ensewe. Shortly after, the King
in like sort commanded him, that he should send unto him, by Lodun, the
Commissions for the Captains, which ought to be provided of vacant Companies,
which he must needs do, albeit he had never meddled with those Companies
since the coming of the Vidasme: notwithstanding that all his predecessors
had been accustomed, to nominate the same companies, as had been practiced as
well by himself in his own right being Colonel of the footmen, as by them
which had been before him. This disgrace was likewise offered unto him, that
notwithstanding any request which had been made by him in the favor of Ossun,
and Frauncisque Bernardin, to be a means they might receive the order, he
could never yeilde them any assurance thereof, but it was D'Anuille which
carried it away, so as ever after they depended on the Conestable. In sum,
the Mareschall still continuing, to make instaunce of supply, wherewith he
might be able to oppose himself against his enemies forces, who might
undertake either the forcing of some hold or fortifiyng themselves in some
new, and by that means might abate their number, it was answered him, that
they were matters easier talked of then done, and that he must needs confess,
that winter was always winter, during which season, men were accustomed to
surcease arms. An answer in deed coined by his enemies, who would not so
much as call to mind the taking of Lans, Valence, Iuree, and sundry other
places in the months of December and January, in the very heart of Winter.
Thus did the complayntes of the Mareschall move the Kings Counsel bente to
turn their eyes an other way, no more, then the news of their enemies
coming into Piemont, no not so much as the descente of the Duke of Alua, at
Gennes with 7000. men: The D. of Alua his army at Gennes.
and that attending their ariuall in Piemont, the enemies had put themselves
within Galliany, (which the Mareschall willing to have fortified, only for a
time to have found the enemy occupied, was constrained for want of money, to
leave and raise it) which they began to fortify. And less the going away of
many Captains and soldiers day by day, especially the Captain Benes who
demanded leave to depart home to his own house; and reply being made unto
him, that he did but come thence, he persisted to say that he would go,
come what would, and whereas he was advised to take time to consider thereof,
and afterward deliver his mind unto the Mareschall, he refused it, and the
next morning went home without once bidding farewell. For this cause he
besought his Majesty, that such disobedience might not go unpunished, and
that his Company might be bestowed on the Captain Lisle: which the King
liked well of, Captain Lisle.
and yet was it afterward rendered again unto him. Of which the Mareschall
afterward complaining, and standing upon, it had been delivered and bestowed
on the Captain Lisle, Serieant of the Battle, who had long and faithfully
served, they would yield no credit at all unto him, but the company was
bestowed upon La Roche a gentleman of D'Anuilles, who had been nothing so long
a Seruitour. True it is that complainte being made of the wrong which thereby
was done to the Mareschall, it was in the end restored to the Captain Lisle.
In fine the Mareschall well weighing how he was handled, and how that the
instances and importunities which he continued as well by letters, as express
messengers to have the affairs of Piemont better provided for, brought forth
no fruit at all, as small credit being yielded thereunto, he besought leave of
his Majesty that he might come home, and kiss his hand, especially to declare
unto him the estate of his affairs and to deliver up an account of the
government which he had received, The Mareschall Brissac going out of
Piemo^t, leueth Gonner his brother Liuetenant general.
the which his Majesty granted for this cause, having settled all things as
conveniently as he was able he departed out of Piemont, leaving Gonner his
brother the Kings Liuetenant General in his absence. Being arrived at the
Court, and understanding how some bad impressions had been put into the Kings
head, as well against him as sundry other Governors and Captains in Piemont,
he besought his Maiesttie, hat he would send thither to sift out the matters
to the end, that he and they might be punished, in case they were found
true: and if they were found contrary, that the accusers might bear the
punishment, which the accused should have deserved: to the end that by this
example all false accusers might be taught. Notwithstanding his Majesty
would do nothing, saying that he believed no whit at all the accusers, that
he should speak no more thereof, but persevere well and diligently to do him
service. Let us leave the Mareschall at the Court, to look back into the
old pursuites which they began to renew against the Lutheranes, for expiation
of the desastre and misfortune of S. Quentins.

As the managing of foreign affairs, does ordinarily breed a carelessenes
among men at home, the great ones bare such an affection to these wars, and
the Churchmen and justices turned their eye so far fixed thereon, for fear
least the event thereof would give some shrewde check to all France. And
besides they dispensed by little and little in such sort, with the pursuites
of those which had been accused for the evil opinions which they held of the
faith, as now a man could not see in all places but an incredible number of
Lutheranes, to the great disadvantage of the Catholicques, notwithstanding any
severe ordinances or rigorous punishment, which had been before made against
them. There was no speech but of the secret assemblies which night and day
were made in many places, Assembly of Lutherans discovered in S Iacques street
in Paris
and especially in Paris: where in the end they discovered one in S. Iacques
street, right over against the College of Plessis. Many saved themselves, yet
some were slain in their own defense, and a great number remained there of
prisoners, of all sexes, ages, and qualities, the women were the vnchoifed,
beaten, and railed at in all sorts. Among whom the Ladies Douartie, de
Rentigny and de Champaigne, with mistress Graueron de Guienne, near S. Foy
were prisoners. De Grauelles a young advocate in Parliament, Clinet a
schoolemaister, renowned for his knowledge, and sundry other to the number of
six score were taken, and clapped fast in hold, afterward these two with
Graueron having their tongue cut out because they should not speak, were burned
together in the place Maubert, Lutherans punished.
and a number of other in sundry other places. Certain days after Graueron
his confiscation was begged, and obtained by the Marquess of Trans, son in
Law to Bertrandie, keeper of the great Seal. But these Ladies after long
detayning were restored to their husbands, clean contrary to them in
religion, and the widow D'ouartie was sent back to the Queen: for this cause
sundry Articles were added as then to the former, as well against these
assemblies, as against books brought from Geneua: and they began a fresh a
new pursuit against the people, giving out that they assembled by night
together, and having put the candels out, each man adressed himself to her
that liked him best, to abuse her at his pleasure. Upon these proceedinges and
persecutions, about which there grew a great stir between the Liuetenant
Civil, and Criminel of Paris, before which of them the cause should be tried,
Musnier being the Civil, showed himself so sharp upon this pursuit, as he
took the matter upon him above the Criminell, to whom in very deed it ought
to have appertayned. A little before the King having been persuaded that by
some fault of obedience in the judges, or thorough the strife for one an others
jurisdiction, and to avoid the expenses of the pursuites, how that the
Lutheranes were so sore multiplied, and assemblies already made by them in
public, ordained at Compiegne 24. of Iulie. 1557. Ordinances against the
Lutheranes.
That the Ecclesiastical Judges should not be troubled, in the trial, award of
process, or jurisdictions of any crime of Heresy. That the royal judges
should hold plea, award Process and punish all Sacramentaries, and disturbers of
the public repose, upon pain of death. But the confiscations and fines which
should grow upon their judgments, to charitable and public works, not to
the kings use, who renounceth the gifts and whatsoever else might thereby
grow unto him. Shortly after the Prince being as yet further animated by the
Churchmen, for the great assemblies which the Lutheranes made throughout his
whole Realm, especially in Paris, as well to celebrate the Supper and other
exercises of their religion, as to go a whoaringe said they, and commit other
detestable acts forbad these conuenticles, upon pain of raising the houses in
which they should be made, to what Lord soever they were proper, at Vilier
Cotteretz the 14. of September, 1559. And for the better confirmation thereof
King Francis the second added since pain of death, to all such as should be
the authors of such assemblies, whether they were made for religion or no, and
that as well by day as night, and to all such as should assist, without hope of
ever having their houses builded up again: at Blais in the month of November
1559. And the 14. of November he pardoned the discloser thereof, and gave him
for the first time one hundred crowns. And afterward he wills in February
following, that all Lords Justices shall be deprived of their iusticeshippes,
and the royal officers of their estates and offices, which should any ways
be found negligent in punishing of the authors of these assemblies, with an
iniunction to the officers to advertise him of their duty within on month
after any such assembly made, and his procters general, to whom they should
send the coppie of the information, and other proceedinges thereupon. The
Lutheranes in like sort, to put out of men's heads, especially of the Princes,
and Churchmen, such vile conceits as had been given out and imprinted within
them, as well of heresy as of their filthy and lewd behauiours in their
assemblies, which they made night and day, advised themselves, to cause the
articles of their confession of faith, to be presented unto the King and
published in all places, and to beseech his Majesty that it might be permitted
unto them to assemble themselves in public, to the end all men might see how
they behaved themselves, offering to yield themselves to any such pain and
punishment, as it should please him to ordain, in case they were found of
any worse conversation then the rest of the Christians. There ensued thereof,
what you shall below perceive.

Now since that all France, feeling the discommoditie of the disastre of S.
Quentin, no man could abstain from pouring out complaints, some attributing
the evil to have proceeded from the ambition of the one side, some from the
covetousness of the other part, there were enough found, which imputing the
cause to arise no whit from any man, said that God was the sole author
thereof, to stir up the flacknes both of great and small, because they did
not their duty in the prosecutinge of the Lutheranes, of whom if France, nay
all Christendom were not in short space purged, the King himself ought not
to expect any other progress of his life, and managing of his estate, then
accursed and reproachful to his whole posterity. In sum they so animated
this Prince, to renew and increase the punishment of those people, Persecution
of the Lutheranes.
that it never grew so hot a time for them as then, which not being able to
remedy by any so earnest pursuites as by flight, recantation, or
dissimulation, they endeavored to mollify the courage of the greater sort, so
hotly enflamed against them, by a little writing, wherein they enforced
themselves to prove that all the scourges and calamities sent from God upon
that Realm, proceeded only from the contempt and corruption of the true word
of God, whereof they persecuted the true ministers and executors. Adding in the
end such means as the King should hold, if he would see his Realm happy,
with a repose agreeable to all his subjects, and clear delivered from all
differentes, which might fall out for the matter of Religion.

THe calamities and afflictions (said they) which possess all Christendom,
clean oppressed and left desolate, were so great, as every man confessed that
they proceeded from the just judgments of God, and for that men suffered so
many sorts of heresies to be hatched forth, as reign at this present. But the
mischief was indeed, for that none of them, which had the public
gouernemente, and to whom it appertained to provide thereto, did regard with
any good judgment founded upon the holy Scriptures, who were the Heretics,
and what the true and false is, thence to draw out a true rule and concord,
and that the true office of a King was to give himself to the knowledge of
such differentes, as had done to the good Kings Ezechias, Josias and other.
And afterward having laid down which were the marks and differences of the
true and false Religion, it was written in these terms. Consider I beseech now
(Sir) and you shall find, that all afflictions happened unto you, at such time
as you undertook to run over those whom you call Lutheranes. When you made
your edict of Chasteaubriant, then did God send war unto you. But when you
caused the execution thereof to cease, and as long as you were enemy to the
Pope, being gone into Allemaigne for the protection of the German liberty,
defended by the Protestants, and afflicted for religion: your affairs
prospered, as your own heart could wish. Contrariwise what is happened unto
you since that you are joined with the Pope, having received from him a sword,
which he sent unto you for his protection, and who was the cause to make you
break the truce. God has turned in one instant your prosperities, into such
afflictions, that they are no less to be feared upon your self then upon
your realm. To what end is Monsieur de Guise his enterprise in Italy turned,
going to the service of the enemy of God, with full deliberation to ruin at
his return the valleies of Piemont, to sacrifice them unto God as a fruit of
his victories. The issue has well showed how that God is able to reuerse our
deliberations, as of late he did that of Monsieur le Conestable at S.
Quentins, on S. Laurence day, having vowed unto God that at his return he
would go ruin Geneua, if he obtained the victory. Afterward having alleged
a number of diverse particular examples, of mark notwithstanding, and of all
sorts of estates, who (they said) dyed of a strange and extraordinary
fashion, having been sworn enemies to the Lutheranes, they added. If it
please your Majesty well to advise thereof, you shall find that you had no
sooner concluded to run them over, but even as suddenly new troubles were
stirred up by your enemies, with whom you have not been able to fall to any
accord. The which God has not permitted, for that the foundation of the
peace, was upon the persecution which you determined to make of the servants
of God. As also the Cardinals have not been able by their cruelty, to hinder
the course of the Gospel; which has already taken so deep a root within
your Realm, as if God should slack you the bridle to root them out, you
should be as it were a King without subjects Tertullian very well said
that the blood of Martirs was the seed of the Gospel. To take away then al
these mischeefes, proceeding from the riches of the Papists, which causes so
great whoredoms, Sodomies and incests, wallowing and nourishing themselves like
swine, with idle bellies, the best way were to put them again into their former
estate, as the ancient sacrificers the Levites were, to wit without lands and
posessions, as an express commandment thereof was given to Joshua. For as long
as the ordinance of God took place and that they were exempt from ambition,
the purity of religion remained in her entier. But when as they began to
aspire to principalities, riches, and worldly honors, then did those
abominations swell out which Jesus Christ there found. Thus was it in the
Primitive Church: for she flowrished and remained in purity, as long as her
ministers were simple, and sought not their own greatness and particular
profit, but only the glory of God. For when as the Popes began to tend to a
Superintendency, and usurped the true Domaine of the Empire, under a shadow of
a false Donation, they wrested the scriptures, and attributed unto themselves
that service which we owe unto God. Therefore your Majesty may with good right
cease upon all their temporalties in a sound conscience to employ them to their
true and proper use. First to the maintenance of the faithful ministers of
Gods word, which should be distributed among them for their nouriture and
entertainment as the case should require. Secondly to the maintenance of the
officers of your Justice. Thirdely to the nouriture and entertainment of
Colleges, and to bring up the youth of the poor to what they should be most
apt to be applied. And for the rest which is infinite, it should remain for
the maintenance of your own estate, conducting of your own affairs, and
comfort of your poor people which only carries the burden, and possesses as
it were nothing. And in doing this an infinite number of men, and especially of
your nobility, which now live of the Crucifix, will employ themselves to your
service, and the Commonwealthes, so much the more diligently, as they shall see
that you will recompense none but such as shall have deserved it. For there is
neither Captain, nor Lord, which will not think himself better recompensed
with a benefit of 500. livers, then to see 1000. to be given unto his
brother, to have them spent in Dogs, and whoares. And there is an infinite
number of men within your Realm, which occupy the fairest estates and
offices, and never deserved ought of the common wealth. By this means it should
be an easy matter for your Majesty to be served only by your own french
nation in the wars, according to the advice and council of the Sieur de
Langey. For you shall find but too many men, in whom there shall be more
fidelity, then in strangers, which exercise themselves in war with your
expense, and carry the money clean out of your Realm. As also the sommes which
you give yearly for pensions to forrainers, and such as go to Rome every day
for Collations of benefices, which lend that again to your enemies, to make
war against your self. And in thus doing, all shall remain still in your
own Realm, which thereby will grow rich, opulent, and invincible. When the
Papists do see that they have no reason at all to gainesay, then do they
assay to render such as they call Lutheranes, odious unto your Majesty, and
tell you (if their saying were true) that you should be made a private person,
and that there never happened any change of Religion, but the like ensued of
the Government. A matter as false, as their accusing of us to be
Sacramentaries, and that we deny the authority of Magistrates, under color
of of some furious Anabaptists, which Satan has stirred up in our time to
obscure the light of the Gospel. For the histories of the Emperors which
first began to receive the Christian religion, and that which is happened in
our own time declare the contrary. Was there (...) Prince more feared and
obeyed then Constantine was in receiving the Christian Religion? Did he
therefore abandon the Empire? Nay he was rather so much the more confirmed
therein, and those of his posterity which were contented to be guided thereby.
For touching those which swarued away, and followed men's traditions, God hated
them, yea their race is no longer continued upon the earth, in so great horror
does God hold them which abandon him; be it never so little. And in our time
the late Kings of England and Princes of Germany, were they at any time
constrained, in purging away of such superstitions as the malice of time had
brought in, to abandon their kingdoms and principalities? Every one may
clearly see the contrary. And how great honor, obedience, and fidelity, do
those people bear unto their Princes, and superiors, which have received the
reformation of the Gospel in our time? Nay I might say how that Princes before
knew not what it was to be obeyed, when as the rude and gross people would
easily receive the Popes dispensation, to drive out their Princes and natural
Lords. Did you ever perceive any of those, whom they call Lutheranes, to
tend to any trouble or sedition, notwithstanding the cruel punishments
which they have endured? I call for this to witness Monsieur le Mareshall de
Brissac, if he have found within Piemont, any people more obedient, then those
of the valles of Angrongne, and the rest, and when at any time he laid any
charge upon them, were it never so hard, if they did not bear it without
murmuring. Whereas if they had not held for certain that Kings, Princes and
Magistrates, are ordained of God, they would not so willingly have obeyed: but
being constrained by force would more slackely have behaved themselves. The
true and only remedy (Sir) is, that you cause a holy and free council to be
held, wherein your self shall proceed, and not the Pope, nor any of his,
which ought only to defend their causes by the holy Scriptures. This done
according to the example of the good Kings Iehosaphat, Ezechias, and Josias,
you must abolish out of the Church all kinds of Idolatry, superstitions, and
abuses, which shall be found directly against the holy Scriptures, and new
Testamente: you must range your self together with your people to the true and
pure service of God, without harkenninge any whitte to the Papists sayings,
that such questions have been decyded in the said Councelles. For we know
well enough, that no Council has been lawful, since that the Popes having
usurped principality, and tyranny over the souls, made them but to serve to
their own covetousness, ambition and cruelty. And the contrariety which is
found in them, makes them to be sufficiently disprooued, with an hundred
thousand other absurdities against the word of God, which are to be seen
therein. The true disproouing of these descisions is to be found in the true
and sacred Scriptures, to which neither time nor age could give any
prescription. For by them we receive the Councels founded upon the word of
God: and by them we reject whatsoever contrarieth the same. And if you do
thus (Sir) God will bless your enterprise, he will increase and confirm your
raygne and Empire, and likewise your posterity: If otherwise, the ruin is at
your door, and accursed is the people which shall remain under your obedience.
There is no doubt but God will harden your heart, as he did to Pharaoh: take
your Crown from of your head as he did to Jeroboam, Nadad, Baasa, Achab, and
as many of the rest of the Kings as followed men's traditions, contrary to Gods
commandment: and give you over to your enemies, to triumph over your self
and your chileren. And if the Emperor Anthony the gracious albeit he was a
Pagan and idolater, seeing himself oppressed with so many wars, was willinge
to cause the persecutions to cease, which in his time were made against the
Christians differinge until the end thereof, to provide thereunto, and to
hear their reasons how much more ought you which bear the name of Most
Christian, to be careful and diligent to make these persecutions to cease,
against the poor Christians, especially consideringe that they never did nor
do trouble, in any kind of sort the estate of your Realm, or of your
affairs, nor tend to any sedition or trouble? Considering in like sort, that
the Jews are suffered throughout all Christendom, albeit they are natural
enemies to our Lord Jesus Christ whom we hold by one common accord for our
God, Redeemer and Savior? and until you shall have heard the matter lawfully
debated, and also understand our reasons taken out of the holy Scriptures?
And that your Majesty of your self judge, whether we be worthy of such
punnishmente. For if we be not convicted by the word of God: fire, sword,
nor the most cruel torments in the world, shall daunte us no whit at all.
They be the exercises which God has promised to his, and has foretold them,
that they must happen in the latter time, to the end they stoulde not be
troubled, when they see such persecutions to fall out.

The chiefer sort for all that made no account at all of all these reasons,
and never the whit less ceased the Lutherane persecution, recommended
thoroughout all France.

Were it that they were not disclosed unto them, or that the Catholicques
watered them with some other contrary reasons, which animated them more then
ever.

Let us leave then the fires, the blood, the complaints, and discourse of the
Lutheranes running over the whole Realm, and quarters bordering about, to
look back again into the happy, and no less bloody progress of the
desseines which the Spanyarde thought to execute over the fairest of all
France.

The Prince of Piemont being resolved in the mean space to continue the Siege
of Saint Quenrins, would in no ease hearken to their advise, which counseled
him, to pass forwards to the pursuit of so fair a Treat: considering that
France was altogether daunted, at the loss of so many of her nobility, and
good Soldiers: besides the absence of the Duke of Guise, which had carried
into Italy the rest of the flower of France: that the Parissians already
trembled, who half resolved to quitte their Town, would clean abandon it,
only upon the apparaunce of a second Bastonnadade: that in sum there wanted
no more for him now, but courage to presenre himself in the view of so rich
a City, to heap upon himself the triumph of an immortal glory.

He on the contrary part weighing the unconstant variety of human things,
the most assured whereof clean ruin themselves by the r'encounter of a much
more simple accident then one will easily believe: the riches, the infinite
populousnes of France, the number of Princes and other personages of mark
escaped from the battle, the thousands of men of war, which were in so
many Garrisons dispersed over all the Frontires, ready to make up an other
fresh Army, against his altogether tired, having by the loss of so many
gallaunt men bought his honor, esteemed it much more safe, to block in
straighter then ever, the Admiral and Dandelot his brother, who was entered in
with five hundred men only, of all the succors which the Conestable could
get, as I before told you: the ariuall of which encouraged the rest, who had
almost quitted all, as soon as they percyued some of the french Enseignes to
stand on the top of the Spanishe Trenches. Whose presence caused them to
suspecte that, which a few soldiers, K. Philip comes for his Army after
the battle.
which were escaped and entered in, assured them of, especially after the
magnificent salutation and welcome, which the whole Army made unto King
Philip, who caused the Cannon shot to redouble, having brought other from
Cambray, with intent to beat Saint Quentins into powder, or blow it up by
force of Mines, which they continued there and renewed day by day, albeit
they were vented often enough by the coutermines of the beseeged, among whom
S. Remy trauayled without cease, and Lanfort an English man, whose
countermine was more advanced then any of the rest.

And forasmuch as the Admiral could not get any great service of the
Inhabitants and Pioners, he thrust out six hundred of the most idle bellies,
whose example though in their view they saw them well beaten and evil
entreated by the Spanyardes, could for all that little stir them up, so
weary were they, and backward to the perfourmance of their duty.

The Fleminges and Spanyardes arrived before Saint Quentins the second day of
August, and from that day, until the one and twentieth, they went about no
other work, then digging and hollowing the Trenches, as well for the surety
of the Artillery, as the better to approache and gain the Ditches.

The 22. of August the Spanyardes began their great Battery at S. Quentins.
They which were besieged in the mean space, could not greatly annoye them
with any sallie they made upon them, (as it has been told you, by reason of
the small number of those which were besieged, and for that all the sallies
which the Lord Admiral caused to be made, were only but to take breathe, and
to be advertised of what his enemies meant to undertake: for so much as he
doubted least they would work some new Mines, whereof he could not have
any knoweledge at all.

That day, as soon as ever it began to break, they saluted the Town, with
a full Battery. For all the shot that had been before, came from the
platfourme of the Fauxbourg D'Isle, whence they saw them work and
countermine, continuing the play of the Cannon, all the whole day long, and
not at one only place, not much of the night passing over, but that they still
removed their Pieces from one place to another, to make a new battery. For
from the second day, they began to dig and carry forth the earth of the
Ditche on their side, and shortly after they propped up coueringes with great
Timber, under which they might trauerse to and fro, and enter within the
Ditches, without any man being able to do them harm. Because there were not
any Flanckers at all to command the Ditch, where they might either view, or
lay battery unto them. And all the stones which they were able to fling at
them, could not endammage them, by reason of the coueringes, under which they
creapte.

They began their Battery at the Windemyll, which was near unto Saint John's
gate, and afterward scowred this place, as far as the Tower on the water,
with such a fury, that there was not left one sole Tower, which was not rent
and razed, with the better part of the Courtayne, laying the Battery in
diverse places with five and forty Pieces.

All those which were within were greatly cousined, and deceived in one thing,
that they thought the Masons work and Cyment of the towers and courtines much
more stronger and better then it was, the steares and thickness of the walls
being very large. But the stuff was so naught, that as soon as the top was
but a little shaken and loosed, all the rest fell down of it self in great
lumpes, whereby many were slain and hurt with the crestes and battlementes of
the Parapettes.

On the 4 day of their Battery, they carried twelve pieces alongest the side of
Bourg D'Isle, and mounted them within the Abbey, from whence they battered the
gate where the fire was put into powder, until they had made themselves
Masters of the Ditches. S. Remy still well hoped to have performed some
matter of worth, but when he saw them once lodged within, he told the
Admiral, that he was not able to do them any more harm, for that they had
gotten the upper ground of him: Reiterating many times, that he never set his
foot in so badde a place, and that long before that, he had advertised the
late King thereof. Not for that he was the more dismayed thereat, or spoke of
any pusillanimitie, but angry, for that he found no remedy at all, nor such
means as he could have wished, being for the rest a man very resolute and
wise. From the very first day of the Battery, until the end thereof, the
Admiral, D' Andelot, and S. Remy, went every night to view the damages, and
onvertures which the Artillery had made, and on the day resolved with those
Captains of the Quarters whom it concerned, of that which they had to execute.

After that the Battery had continued four days, there was a great fear
engendered among those of the Town, yea and the men of War themselves, which
the Admiral getting knowledge of, walking by night to remedy the same, he
held one language common and general to them all, in a place, where almost
all the Captains, and many soldiers were assembled together, which was, that
he had firmly agreed, and resolved in his mind, to keep that place with
those men which he had, and if any man did at any time see him vary, or offer
any speech of composition, he gave him leave to throw him down as a cowarde
into the Ditches: and in like case, if he found any of them to parley to the
contrary, he would do no less by them. And by this occasion there never
passed over day, but two or three times he would walk himself about the
quarters, and in passing by, would demand the Captains opinions, conferring
and communicating with them, what was done in the rest of the places: according
unto that which he had prayed them, the first day that he entered within the
Town, that every man would advertise him, of that which he esteemed best for
the conservation of the place. The battery continued until the sixte day,
about two of the clock in the afternoon, that they likewise presented
themselves in sundry places within the ditches, as far as the Parapettes at a
pikes leangth.

At this present, the Sentinel from the steeple of the great Church,
advertised the Admiral, how that of all hands the Army raunged themselves
into battle, and that many footmen martched toward the Trenches. The which
he caused to be made known, in all places and quarters of the Town, to the
end that every man might stand upon his guarde, imagining that they meant
that day to give the assault, and he himself went to three of the next
breaches unto him, to see what order was there kept. Where he found every
man in all apparaunce willing to perform his duty, the like whereof he also
understood from all the rest of the places, whither he had sent Gentlemen to
view. Which was the cause that himself returned back again very well
content to the Breach. Which he kept, being that which he supposed the enemies
meante to turn their principallest strength against: for that they ever most
sought to batter this place, and to leave nothing which might serve for
Flanckes, especially for that it lay just over against the entry, which they
had made into the Ditche.

As they were all thus attending the assault, the enemies put fire to three
mines, all which were right under the Rampire, the principallest were in the
quarter of D' Auphin. But the damage was nothing so great as they looked for,
being the cause that they gave no assault that day. So afterward they did
not overmuch heat them selves, but were contented to go and view the
breaches on the Admirals side, and descend into the Ditche which D' Andelot
kept.

After that the Spanyardes were retired, the Admiral went to view what hurt
those Mines had made, and found, that by that onuerture, they were not very
like to receive or incur any great danger, but that for all that, it was
fit to work upon it, which he deferred until night, for that they durst
not touch there, or show themselves by day, by reason of the full view,
which their enemies Artillery had of them.

The great advantages of the Spaniardes and small means which the French had
to endure the siege.
Now were there eleauen breaches, many mines, the ditche gained, and the
Soldiers therein well covered, the Army great to gain the breaches, against
eight hundred soldiers, and men at arms of all sorts, distributed as the
Admiral thought good, the countermines little available, because that the
Spanyarde being in the Ditche, had already gained the top, most of the
soldiers wavering, as well for that day by day they saw the Cannon shot
redouble, to the loss of many of them, as thorough the small number of people,
which were left, and the badde handling of the matter by the Inhabitants,
which discouraged them as much as was possible. Hereupon the Prince of Piemont
judging the breaches reasonable, gave order for the assaults. The first was
given to Captain Cazeres, Master of the Camp of the old Spanishe bands,
and to Lazare Colonel of fiueteene hundred Almaines, who were there much
endamaged. The second to Captain Nauarres with the Spaniardes, and the Compte
of Meigue, with the Wallons. The third to Captain Julian Romero with three
Enseignes of Spaniardes, and two thousand English, who falling down from the
top of a breach, brake his leg. The fourth to Captain Carrondellette with
three Enseignes of Bourguignons, who there lost a hand. The Admiral in the
mean time went and sent to all places, to the end every man should be ready
to abide the^, and put them back. At the last he discovered three Enseignes at
the foot of the Parapet, being gotten up thither, without making any noise or
sound of Dromme, at which time he made every man present himself to fight.
But they could not repress them in that place, but that they began to
creep and mount up by one and one to an high Tower, which had been battered
with Artillery, at a corner of the Captain La Guard his quarter. When the
Admiral saw that they took that way, he was very glad, for there they
grapeled and mounted very uneasily, and from the place where himself stood
he might a little discern them thorough a Flancker, whereby he annoyed them
as much as he was able with three harquebusiers, which remained with him,
thinking verily, that it was impossible for them to force in that way. In the
end he saw those Enseignes which went up to the top of the tower, put
themselves down, but he presumed that it was within some Trenche within the
Parapet, to be more at couerte, until they told him, that the enemies had
forced the Breach. Then turning himself toward those which stood about
him, he told them, that they must go help to succor it.

Upon that Saragosse coming unto him, asked him, whether he would go, and
what he would do: to whom he answered, that he meant to go help to sustain
the force of the Breach, which should be offered, where either they must all
dye, or put back the enemy. And thereupon he began to go down from off
the Rampire.

Now you must understand, that he was not as then far from the Tower, by
which the Spanyardes entered, but there was a long trauerse and a high, which
hindered them from seeing what was done there.

The Admiral being come down from off the Rampire, he saw all that quarter
clean abandoned, without so much as one man to make head, by reason, said
they, that kept that guarde, that they were not able to hinder the coming of
the assailante, it being not possible to descrie or perceive them, until they
were come to the breach, in such sort as the Spanyardes aryuing there in
abundance, and calling up one an other, it was an easy matter to make them
selves Masters, finding no person to make resistaunce.

The Admiral only accompanied with four, whereof one was a Page, and going
to gather together his Troops and make head, as soon as he was there arrived,
saw himself enwrapped of all parts. Knowing then how that it rested no more
in his power to remedy this disorder, the Town being already full of
soldiers, the Almaines entering in by great Troops, he fought as much as he
was able to fall into the hands of some Spanyarde, as it rightly chanced unto
him, chosing rather in that place, to abide the brunte of a common general
fortune, and all success, either good or badde, then by flying away to attain
an immortal shame. He which took him prisoner, made him a while to repose
himself at the foot of the Rampire, where he was all aloane, having lost all
his Forces: from thence he led him, and made him to enter into one of the
Mines, which he had made to gain the Ditche, where he found at the entry
thereof, the Captain Alonce de Cazieres, Master of the Camp, of the old
Spanishe bands, to which place the Prince of Piemont arrived incontinently, and
commanded Cazieres to carry him into his Tente.

Thus was that fair and rich Town of S. Quentins conquered on the seven and
twenty day of August, 1557. in which they found great booties, The Town of
S Quentins very rich and full of great booties.
and mighty riches, in that it was the Staple of sundry Marchaundises, which
were transported into the Low Countries, and likewise brought from those
places thither, thorough the intercourse of trade and traficque. Without
comprehending besides many good Prisoners, which they found there, as well of
those of the Town, as of such other chief Persons and Captains, as were come
in for the defense thereof. D' Andelot was likewise there taken: but well
remembering the badde entertainment which he had received at their hands
during his imprisonment in Italy, he chose rather to adventure his life, in
seeking to escape, then to fall again an other time into that calamity and
misery. In such sort, as he crept under the fasteninges of a Tente, and by
night having sounded diverse passages within the Marshes, he found means to
escape their watches, and Corpse de guardes, and saved himself at Han.

De Iarnac was there taken Prisoner, so were S. Remy, De Humes, De la Guarde,
De Cuzieux, De Moulins, the Captains Brueile and Bretaigne, De Rambouillet,
Saint Romain, Saint Andre, Lignieres, and Soleil.

There were slain there, the son of La Fayette, the Captain Salleuert,
Enseigne to La Fayette his Company, the Captains Oger, Vignes, La Bar,
L'Estang, Gourdes, with sundry other.

After the Sack of Saint Quentin, Means of well employing an Army.
King Philip making no outward apparaunce of his intention, caused the King
and the Duke of Neuers his Lieutenaunt general to prepare for all occurrentes
the best that they were able: and especially to provide for such places as were
nearest to that which was taken. But as he was earnestly solicited to this
effect, by every Governor, to send such provisions as were requisite, they
were all astonished at the yielding up of Castelet, which a few days before
the taking of Saint Quentins, the Compte of Aremberge otherwise called
Brabanson, enclosed about in one instaunte with a thousand horse, all alongest
the marishe, and toward Saint Martins Abbey: a little above which were
encamped three Regimentes of Lansquenettes of fourteen Enseignes, with twenty
pieces of Battery planted in two places.

And albeit that the assurance, which the Baron of Solignac who commanded
there, had yielded to the King and his Lieutenaunte, caused them to repose on
that side, whilst that they hasted forwards the Swizers and Almaines, the
French Fanterie and Cauallerie, to furnishe out the Rende-vous, so as within
fiueteene days they might make up the form of an Army, yet even in the
very beginning of September it yielded up. The which was found very strange,
considering that the place was strong, and well provided of all that was
necessary to a Frontire: at the least it was looked for, that they should
have tarryed the Assault. An occasion that the King caused him to be clapped
up Prisoner as soon as he was come to Paris.

But he was set at liberty, declaring how he had been disappoynted of such
necessary Succoures as he required, of two thousand men, in such sort as
D'Estre the Governor in former time had upon any Siege. Besides that, the
enemies having found the Castle without any ditche, on that side where they
began their principal Battery, and a Bastion fallen down not yet repaired
up, in such sort behaved themselves, as that the ordinary soldiers of the
Guarde of that Bastion, were soon constrained to abandon it, thorough the
great quantity of Brick and mould which endamaged them, and ordinarily fell
upon them: the Battery being so violent and furious, as in a small space it
made a way for a horse to be able to get up upon the Bastion, the way lying
all open to come from thence to the breach, which albeit it was not altogether
sufficient, waxed wyder within two volleyes of the Cannon, and enlarged it
self six score pace, or more, the Wall already bowyng and yielding of the
same length, and the earth opening a pace in breadth, and in deapth the length
of a pike.

Which the Soldiers once perceiving, who were not in the whole number three
hundred, nor half of them in health and strength, they were so astonished, and
despayred, that notwithstanding any persuasions which the Captains could use,
many stuck not to say, they would not fight at all, not knowing how they
were able to do the King any Service therein, and therefore they thought it
better to reserve themselves for some matter of greater importance.

Howesoeuer it was, whether grounded or no upon the fear which they conceived
the French were in, least that the Imperialles would pursue further their
good fortune, and duty against such an inconvenience, King Philip, to whom
the besiegers of the Castelet, came to unite themselves at Fon-Some, attended
their answer of his advertisement from the Emperor his Father, to
congratulate with him his prosperity, beseeching him further to command and
ordain what next he was to enterprise.

But as a blade rusteth if it be let lie continually within the sheathe, so the
soldier which is not employed, does lightly abuse his rest. For the Almaines
and Spanyardes quickly mutined among themselves for the booty of Saint
Quentins, and ransom of the prisoners which were taken the day of the
Battle: some alleging among other occasions, how that King Philip and the
Duke of Sanoye sought to retyane all the great prisoners which exceeded a
certain sum, of purpose to pulle them out of the hands of the Almaine
Lords, who without all doubt achieved the greatest honor of the Battle,
so far forth, as they were all ready to depart, the rather for that the
time of their oath was now expired. An occasion the french did turn the matter
to their own advantage, withdrawing out of that nation as many malcontents as
they could find upon any occasion whatsoever. Hereupon the Spaniarde addressed
himself to Han, to erect a strong place upon the frontiere, which might serve
for a succor and support to S. Quentins, the which he determined to make
impregnable, according unto such models as the enioyners had prescribed unto
him, thereby to establish from his low countries easy days iourneyes of
retreat, when he would either go in or come out of France, as it should
seem best unto him. Now as upon new occurrents always proceed new
determinations, the D. of Neuers being constrained to change the estate and
imagination of his defensive, retired his men of war from sundry garrisons,
which he had into such places as were nearest unto Han, to the end that the
imperials should not enlarge themselves into any greater a compass, likewise
to the end they might always wast the country before them, and famish them by
cutting of their victuailes on all sides, the french had devised to make a
removing Camp, which for this effect they might enclose and assure with
trenches, Palissades and other Roman inventions: but the long delay of their
provisions and soddanes and their enemies clean broke of this determination.
The Cheualier Hely, with a number of horse entered within the place to succor
it, running over as many enemies as durst stop the passages of Han, which he
found open without any thing to commaande it being flankerde on the one side
with the River of Some, and on the other with a Marish, being in diverse places
above one hundred thousand paces broad, having very little firm or dry
ground to be able to set foot upon. There is a village and a Castle, the
village in the state which it was then in was not able to hold out in any
kind of sort: and albeit that there were certain foundations and fashions of
bulwarks, yet they were so open and evil to be defended, as that there was
no account at all to be made thereof. The Castle was of a goodly show, and
represented it self furious enough, Description of the situation of Han.
according to the old fortifications, being in form square, flankerde with
four round bulwarks, with a gross square tower, and massiue, of a large
thicknes, serving for a platform to the Courtines, which were joined unto it,
and commaundinge in all and through all the Castle. But the whole was of dry
stones and Masons work, without any rampires of earth, or other
fortifications, according to the modern inventions to sustain and defend a
place long time, against the blusterousnes and fury of our Cannons.
Notwithstanding that the way might not be altogether open and free to the
Spaniarde, to enter further in if he found not a stop, Sepois which was
Governor, had given the King advise to burn the town, in case seege were
laid unto it, whereby the enemy might have no place to lodge in. But as for
the Castle, men might hold and keep it for a few days whilst that they
should be the better able to fortefie themselves: for it was easy to judge
that having taken Han, he would never end there, but pass on further, where
he might cast himself now on the right hand, and now on the left, and so
daily address himself to such places as were weak and likely in a short
time to be carried, to the end he might not lose and evil employ the season;
which served so fit and proper for him.

I have let you to understand, how that to be meet with the inconveniences
of the battle of Saint Quentins, among other preparatiues the King had sent
unto the Duke of Guise, that after that he had to his best advantage accorded
with the Pope, and the Spaniardes, he should bring away the Army into
France with as much speed as were possible. This Prince sodenlie let the Pope
to understand thereof, and made him privy of the necessity which called him
back into France, and how his Princes affairs went. Being the cause which
made him to beseech his holiness to license him, and permit him to retire, after
such time notwithstanding as he had compounded to his own profit the estate of
his affairs. The Pope then being already desirous to end this war, from
which he knew that on the other side to be proceeded as he saw it
evidently, and doubted least it would take end with the ruin of one of these
Princes, and finally with his own, together with a confusion of the
Ecclesiastical estate, and infinitnes of other mischeefes, purposed more then
before, to be agreed with King Philip, which wrought that end, whereof I
before made mention. So as the peace being concluded and published with all
magnificence on Sunday being the 19. of that month the Duke of Alua entered
into Rome, about one of the clock in the after noone, with great apparances of
joy, as well by the salutations of the artillarie, as an infinite number of
squibs, and other merimentes, which they are accustomed to make especially in
those parts, at the welcome and amiable entertainment of any great Prince. The
Monday following they held Consistory, where there were chosen and deputed
two Legates, to entreat of an universal peace. The one which was the
Cardinal of Tiuoli, toward the most Christian King of France, and the other
which was the Cardinal Carlo Caraffe, toward the Catholic King Philip.

The Duke of Guise in the mean space departed out of Italy, to take his way
into France, The Duke of Guises departure
and to imbarke himself at Ostia in the galleys and french vessels which
attended him with a sort of Lords, Captains, and two thousand
harquebusiers, the other part of the Army under the conducte of the Duke D'
Aumalle, returned through the Popes lands toward Bologne and Ferrara, and so
from thence they passed all for the most part through the Grisons and Zuizers
into France, where the Duke of Guise being arrived was suddenly sent for to
address an army at Compienne. At which place the King being anon after
arrived, declared (all such as were then in Court being present,) how that
the Duke of Guise was come iumpe for the preservation of his Realm, and it was
proposed to treat him Viceroy of France. But this title being thought
strange, it was commanded that letters should be dispatched to make him
Lieuetenante General over all the Countries within his obedience. The Duke of
Guise made Liuetenant General by the K. over all his countries.
The which were dispatched by Du Their secretary of the Commandments, and
afterward received and verified by the Parlamente of Paris, and other
sovereign Courts of the Realm: whereof notwithstanding shortly after the
King excused himself toward his Goship, (so he named the Constable)
sendinge him word by secreate Letters that he was constrained to do as he
did, K. H. 2. letters to the Constable being prisoner.
and that he should not be grieved for ought, in that he still reserved his
place for him, for he was so far off, from having the frendshippe which he
boar unto him any ways cooled through his absence and captivity: that
contrariwise it inflamed him the more, so far as that he most diligently
aduertysed him of all his secretest affairs, without communicating ought
gently aduertysed him of all his secretest affairs, without communicating
ought to any other. Whereof King Philip being aduertysed, knew well enough how
to make his profit as you shall see else where.

In this same time there happened in like sort, strange floudes, and
inundations of Rivers at Rome, and likewise at Florence. That at Rome fell out
the same day of the peace, being the fourteenth of September, Tiber, one of
the most renowned Rivers of Europe, which some notwithstanding number among
the swift snowie streams being greatly swelled, as though it would threaten
Rome with great ruins, encreasinge howrely for the night followinge it began
to enlarge it self over all the low grounds, of the meadows and vineyardes
round about. The next day it being increased and broken in throughout the
town, all the channels and gutters of the streets and houses standing full,
the depth thereof was found in some places of the town of the height of a man,
and more in the place D'Agone, A la Roconde and A la Doan^. So far was this
marvelous and dreadful inundation, from giving leisure to the people to
rejoice at this peace, as that it made them more astonished and desolate then
before, which caused a number to think that it happened as a sign and
advertisement from God, either for matters present or to come, or rather to
move us to a conversion and amendment of our sins. Now this fury of the
water endured all that day and until four of the clock at night, that it
began a little to ebb and decrease, so as by the next morning at break of
day, Signs serve for admonitions from God
it was ebbed more then a shaftemente, and then by little and little
decreasing, every man in the afternoon might easily go about this business.
The depth of the water, as some have said, in many places exceeded the mark
which was left at the other inundation in the year 1530. Others were of
opinion that it wanted an handbredth. Whereupon they alleged many reasons,
among other that the Caves which were made and coured within Rome (for it is
augmented in buildinges a third part) had received and swallowed up a great
part of the water, Some judged that the great number of new streets was a
cause of the depth, and other affirmed how that the earth which was raised up
since that time, caused it seem higher then it was. But they which judged it
to be the greatest, say that it fell out so, for that in the town of Horta
and Narin, and all other places where it passed alongest, it left behind it a
great abatement and ruin of houses: having carried away half the bridge of
Saint Marie, together with the excellent chapel which Pope Iulie the third
caused to be builded there: it undermined and removed certain great pieces of
marble, Ruins caused at Rome by the floode.
and great quarters of stone which defended the bridge of Saint Ange. It raised
and renuersed a great part of the bulwarks and bastions which they had caused
to be builded a year since joining to the Castle. Besides that it threw
down half the Temple, and most part of the buildinges of Saint Barthlemewes
monastery seated in the Island of Tiber. Briefly, there was not within all
Rome, either palace or building, alongest which this furious rage of waters
had passed, which carried not some mark and testimonye of the wrath and
violence of this angry Element. As touching that of Florence by the breaking
forth of the River Arno, men judged it far greater then that at Rome,
Description of the floude at Florence.
and to have occasioned far more incomparable and important losses as well in
overthrowing of houses, as in the destruction and perishing of gold, silver,
marchandises and other sorts of moueables, besides which is more to be
lamented, the death and suffocation of many persons. It first ruined and
ouerturned for the greattest part the Conuents and monasteries of the pore
maidens of Saint Verdiane, of the Kecluses, and of Saint Mary Nouelle. It
carried clean away the bridges of Rubaconde, and La Trinite. It threw down
almost the whole borough of Oquo ^anti, as far as the Medowe, and on the side
of Saint Paul, as it likewise did the new market place, where they exercise
the Art and occupation of skening and twisting of silk. In such sort as all
the store houses and shoppes were for the most part ruined, being a
meruellous loss. The Dukes palace was no whit exempted, but was found
spoiled in a number of places. As touching the region bordering round about
the high way to Cazensin, it was so deep and overflowed in such a manner, as
it could very hardely be repaired to be made passable, and in the borough
there dyed seventy and four persons, carrying the houses clean to Pontasienco
and there remained clean sunk. Pereolle, and Saint Douin, with many other
buildinges all alongest the floode Arno.

Moreover to speak of the depth of the water upon the place of Saint Croix, it
exceeded four good fingers in depth the inundation which happened at Florence
in the year one thousand five hundred forty and seven: which made men judge
the latter to be very great consideringe that the former was almost
incredible. It was the height of one fadome and a half at Saint Croix: in such
sort as the loss was so great and general, as the Duke remitted to his
subjects for a certain time, the most part of his taxes, and subsidies,
which otherwise were very great.

Flood at Nismes in Languedoc.
At the same time, there happened in like sort, on this side, an other floode
at the town of Nismes in Languedoc, differinge notwithstanding from the rest,
in that it was not by the breaking out of any floudes or rivers, but by the
pouring down of the clouds, and opening of the gates of heaven, (as the
Philosophers were wont to term it) the which accident befell the ninth of
September in the same year, together with so fearful thunderings, flashes and
lightnings as all the people verily immagined that that would have been the very
last day of their life, this celestial fury lasting until it was past eight
of the clock at night, besides that, there fell from else where so marvelous
and great an abundance of water, as these miserable and wretched Citizens
thought that together with their whole town, they should have been sunk and
swallowed up. And albeit that it lasted not long, but about some twelve or
fifteen hours, yet notwithstanding it did greatly endemnifie and hurt the
town which was in very many romes and places disformed thereby, and the
territoryes thereaboutes greatly wasted and empouerished: for that the fields
and places of tillage were maruelously covered with stones and other ruins,
such as the rage of waters drives alongest, and leaves at such time as the
force and violence thereof diminishes, and the Olive trees (wherewith this
Province much abounds with great care of trimming them for the great profit,
which is drawn thereby through the oil) were all bruised and broken, and the
Vines clungd together and full of sand, with an infinite number of other
damages and calamities. Briefly many men thought that there was not almost
any thing which felt not the weight of Gods wrathful hand in this flood.

Hereby then were discovered sundry antiquities, hidden and buried under
ground, at the least since the Gottes sacked and rayzed this town, a
thousand years agonne, as well appeared, how long before unknown: as
aunciente sepulchers and Monumentes, great quantity of meddalles in copper, and
some of gold and silver, long pillars of one piece equally proportioned,
testaments, Epitaphes written in hard stone, and graven in pieces after the
Romanisquo. There were discovered likewise fair and rich pauementes, and
floors of low parlers, chambers and shoppes, wherein were found tables of
marble, Porphir, and Jasper, wrought a la Mosaque: besides there were found
many fragmentes of ancient dishes, and some entire, of a red earth, so
passing fine, and sleake, that it carried his own vernishe: the which men in
aunciente time caused to be brought from far Countries, especially from
Samos in Greece, enriched with stories, or clownes resemblances very pleasante.
Many other singularities were there vnterred and brought to light, with great
marvel to as many as saw them. Sundry other places of Europe were likewise
touched with the same mischief and calamity, as numbers of celestial signs,
such as the Comet of the year before, pillars of fire, and in some places
hunting of dogs, crying in the air, and some men fighting, and two suns,
red and inflamed, such as were seen in Almaine: besides many other prodigious
and monstrous works, which nature brought forth in that time, upon the earth,
all which signs could not be adjudged to be any other thing then
threatninges and messengers of the celestial wrath, which should warn us
either to a voluntary acknowledginge of our sins, and amendment of our
lives, or assure us of a vengeance at hand, and punishmente of our iniquities.

To return to the siege of Han, Han battered and taken by King Philip.
it had no sooner endured twelve hundred cannon shot together, which made a
reasonable breach; as well at the great Tower, as the Courtyne, the walls
being there dry without rampires and bastions, but it was yielded and given
over into the hands of King Phillip, the twelft day of the month of
September. Afterward he remained there a while, to advance and set forward
the fortifications which were already begun, addinge thereto as much as was
supposed to have been forgot. And whilst that the Baron of Poleuille, having
been sent by King Phillip at his departure from Sauerne, advanced forward
to join himself in Champaygne, with twenty Ensigns of Almaines, and twelve
hundred horse, occupyinge himself in the places borderinge about he sent to
sease all the strong places remaining in the hands of the French, which were
any ways able to annoye the garrison. Then causing a number of horsemen
furnished after the French fashion to enter in, he surprised Noyon, Noyon
surprised by disguising of rayments
and the companies of light horse of the Baron of Clear, and one of the
Scottishe, upon whom they entered at fair day, the gates being open, from
thence they seized upon Chauny, where they placed a strong garrison, not for
to fortify it, considering the imperfection of the place, and how it was to
be commanded two several ways, but only that thereby they might the more
easily gather the Vines: the vineyardes thereaboutes being very good and of
great compass.

Likewise to favor the conduct of all other kind of victualles wherewith they
mente to furnishe Han, Saint Quentins, and Le Castellet, which they fortified
amayne: besides the great easance of the better Milles which stood upon the
River. Thus fortifying these two places, they passed over the month of
September, and beginning of October, in roades, pilfryes, and burninges, as
well on the one side as the other, still weakening notwithstanding Philips
Army, as well through the English men's return home malcontentes, for want of
their booties, and evil entertainemente, as in respect of the Almanes, who
their oath being now expired retired day by day to the Duke of Neuers, who
furnished with them his bands, that were not complete, and erected new ones
of the surplusage.

The King in the mean space hastened forwards his army, The diligence of
the D. of Neuers at Compienne.
and to assemble it together at Compienne, sent thither the Duke of Neuers,
who speedily employed himself to the making that strong and defensable,
adding to the natural all art possible, for that necessarily, and as it then
stood it served for a frontire to France first causing two large fortes to
be mysed, with high and fair platformes, the one to command over all the
plain, which lies between the forest and the town, and the other over all
the low ground, and course of the river, and along the medowe, employing
besides all diligence to repair the town, flankerde with bastions, cazemates,
tarresses, caualliers, and trauerses, in such sort as in case the enemies
artillarie had arrived there, they should have found play for alonge season:
moreover, he caused the enclosure of a camp to be appointed out, and raised
up with trenches, so large and spacious, as that an army of a hundred thousand
men, was able to lodge there, with all furnitures and provisions, as safely as
within a town, together with all easances as well of the River as of the
country. As he thus provided for the advancement of these fortifications, so
spared he his purse no more then his spirit, to the entertainment of spies,
sent out into all parts. So as having understood the very force and ordinary
usage of the twelve hundred horse which lay in garrison at Chauny, still
ouerrunning without cease, and with great advantages those about Coucy and
Soissons, he gave the rendeuous to Bourdillon, the Prince of Conde, and Count
de la Barbize who conducted the Reistres, to ambush themselves within Chauny
woods whilst that he would send Ienlis to begin a skirmish to the help
whereof such as came out of the town, being no sooner drawn thither then kept
back, the light horse gained both the town and them: so as the Captain of
the Albanois, and his whole troop was cut in pieces. But the Spanishe Captain
getting into a house, which he perced through, held good until that the
French harquebusiers had wrapped him in on every side. The which made him in a
desperatnesse step forth, his courtelaxe in one hand and buckler in the
other, to die honorably with the rest of his fellows, but as he was giving
his faith to the Captain Launay, he killed him, hard by the Prince of Conde
who had done as much to the French man, if the swearing unto him, how that
this Captain had killed the most valiant of his soldiers, and had ever made
foul war upon the French, especially at the defeat of Saint Laurence, he
had not besought him to pardon this his just chollar, which had so far carried
him for the amity of his countrymen.

The Baron of Poleuille, passing in this time over the mountains of Vaulges,
and the County of Ferrette, and coasting Le Bassigni entered within the French
County, between the County of Mont-Belliarde, and Langres: where those of
the County under color that they were constrained thereunto, contrary to
their promises, and pactions of neutralitie, gave him passage, victualles, and
all other provisions for his camp. Afterward he came down into La Bresse,
hoping within very few days to make himself master thereof, through
certain intelligences which he had with some gentlemen of that Province, and
other of their neighbors which were evil affected to King Henrye. So far,
as at his first abord he planted his siege before Bourge, which is the
principal town, thinkinge to have found it unprovided of all things for
defense. But La Guiche which was governor thereof, and the Baron of Digoyne
his Lieuetenant being advertised of his coming, had already caused La Guiches
company to enter in, and some other troops of footmen.

On the other side you might perceive above, how D'Eschenets with his company
followed him continually near hand, as also did De Iours with his 8. ensigns
of the legion of Champagne, who kept him continually so near a neighborhood,
as they were as soon at Bourg as himself, into which they entered, doing
therein a great peace of duty and service to the King, and so was he found
frustrated of his first opinion. Upon the desseine, and pursuit of this Siege,
the Kings Army which returned out of Italy, arrived at the iumpe, so as the
two thousand harquebusiers, which were led by the Vidasme of Chartres,
entered within the Town. And from elsewhere they caused four thousand openly
to approache thither, and three thousand Lansquenettes, the whole Company
which arrived and daily came being stayed and lodged about, as well in Bresse,
as Lionnois, and Mascanois, being all resolved with full intention to charge
when the first occasion should be but offered. In the end after that he had
three several times removed his Camp before the place, the sixetenth day of
October, D'escheuets about the entering in of the night sent fifty
harquebusiers out of the Town, to view his Camp, together with the
countenance and assuredness of his men, who having at their first ariuall
killed the Sentinelles, thrust in, and broke upon their Corpse de guardes, whom
they massacred in part, and caused the rest to fly, putting the rest of the
Army into such a fryght, as from that hour it dislodged: And it made so great
speed to retire, as before that the French could have certain news thereof,
and be ready to follow, they were four leagues off. Where leaving many sick
persons, victuals, and moueables, having taken again the way to the French
County, from which they were come, shortly after the Troops brake of
themselves, and abandoned the Baron their Chief, for that he performed no
iotte of what he had promised unto them.

Now albeit that the desseins of this Baron were thus turned into smoke, The
means which the K. used to levy an Army against the Spanyard.
and the great fire of the Almaine, English, and Spanishe Armies, seemed to
smother and decrease by little and little, so many Nations notwithstanding
being banded against France, could not choose but greatly diminishe the Forces
thereof, and prepare a most certain ruin to the whole Realm, had the
Frenchmen wanted heart to defend themselves, or good will to make supply to
such necessary means, as might best stop the course of the Spanishe
fortune. For King Henrye being no less curious, in such occurrences to raise
up and increase his honor, then to preserve his people from the evil which
was threatened, foreseeing the number of Forces, which would be necessary for
this purpose, and how his Finances being drawn dry, there would rest no
means of furnishing a pay, except he were succored from elsewhere, was
counseled to renew the practice of his ancestors, to wit, to seek aid
and favor of his people, to whom he could not more commodiously declare his
necessity, and persuade them to furnishe out his charge, then by calling
together the general Estates of his Realm. The general Estates of France
assembled by the K. to declare unto them, his necessities and seek succor
against Spain at their hands.
The which he caused to be done at Paris the sixte of January, where all the
Deputies being assembled in one of the Halles of the Palace called Saint Lewis
hall, the Prelates and Ecclesiastical Ministers arrayed with their rochettes,
and surplices, were placed upon such seats, as on the right and left hand
were prepared for them: and on a stage upon the right hand high raised up,
were the Baylifes, Seneschals, and other for the Nobility. Upon a benche
below, covered with flower de lices, were the Presidents of the Parlamentes.
At the end whereof, upon an other lesser form on the same side, sat the
Kings learned Counsel, of the Parliament of Paris, the two advocates, and
proctours of the King. In the middle of the rome, there stood a little square
table, covered with a carpette of cloth of Silver, at which there satte three
Secretaries of the commandments, and two other a little further upon a low
form. At the foot of the Kings chair of Estate, satte the general
Treasourers of the Finances, above whom and in the fullest place of view of
the whole Hall, were set two Chayres, the higher being covered with purple
Velvet pouldred with Flower de Luces Gold, being the Kings seat, and a pace
and a half off, almost on the same rank there was another somewhat lower
covered with cloth of Gold, for Monsieur le D' Auphin his Son. And on the
top hung up a cloth of estate suitable to the K. Chair. The Provost of the
Merchants of Paris, the Sherifes, the Deputies of Rouen, of Lions, of Tolouse,
and consequently of the rest of the Towns, were ranged on the Bishops side
where there was greatest room. Anon after arrived the Knights, having their
great order about their neck. To wit the D. of Neuers, the Prince de la Roche
Sur^yon, the Comte de Sancerre, Durf, and de Bordillon, who mounted up on the
right hand above all the Nobility, hard by the D. of Lorraine, and the rest of
the young Princes. By and by came the K. and Monsieur le D'Auphin his Son,
accompanied with the Cardinals of Lorraine, of Bourban, of Guise, of Castillon,
and of Sens. The King being set, Monsieur le D'Auphin, and the rest of the
Cardinals sat down on the same side.

The K. declaration to the estates of his Realm.
Upon this the King began to deliver how since his coming to the Crown he had
had continual war with the Englishmen and Bourguignons ancient enemies of
France. Into which war he was constrained to enter, for the recovery of
such Frontire places, as his enemies had usurped, as Boulonnois and the rest,
and how that to furnish the defraying of the same, he had been constrained
to sell his own Domaine, and afterward impose many Subsidies upon his
people, wherewith to his great grief they stood sore oppressed: That for the
regard and consideration of them, he had offered to obtain place, albeit it
was at very prejudicial conditions for himself, but only he was moved
thereunto for the singular desire which he had to keep his people in a
peaceable estate, whom he had always found most faithful and enclineable
to his obedience and service. And for so much as he stood advertised that his
said enemies, were in a far greater deliberation then ever, to enterprise and
assail the Realm of France, he reposed all his whole trust after God, in
the fidelity and succors of his said Subjects, and therefore he purposed
to make a strong, great and extreme war, thereby to recover a good peace, as
of mere necessity being compelled thereunto. But for so much as money is the
principal sinew of war, he earnestly besought every one of the states, that
they would now succor him to resist the enemy, and that afterward he would
employ all his endeavor, to attain, and preserve his Subjects in
tranquillity: Promising in the faith of a good King and Prince, that he
would from thence forward so graciously use them and settle all things in
such an order, as every man should have occasion to content himself, and
that for pledge of his good will and affection, he choose to make this promise
in publicque, and in his Sons presence, to the end that both of them might
thereby be comprehended, and bound to the performance of the same.

The King having finished his speech, the Cardinal of Lorraine, holding the
first place, and speaking for the estate of the Church, began a most learned
speech and Oration, and grauelye pronounced, which lasted the spade of an
hour, as well in the praise of the King, as yielding unto him thanks for his
good will and promise: Concluding that they would all submit their bodies and
goods to his will and good pleasure. The Duke of Neuers speaking for the
Nobility in few words said, that they were so affectionated, to his service
and the Realms defense, as that they presented unto the King not only their
bodies and goods, but also their lives. Afterward Saint Andre first
President of Paris, answering upon his knees, in the behalf of the law, and
all the presidents of the rest of the Parliaments of France, first thanked the
King for the good and honor which it had pleased his Majesty to do them, in
erecting a fourth estate of the Law: and also to manifest unto his Subjects;
his good will and affection, with sundry other speeches and thanks giuings,
tending to the praise of his greatness, and of his promise, in that he would
so courageously maintain war, by repelling of the enemy, to attain a long
and perpetual peace for his Subjects, and afterward to redress all things
into their order, to the repose and contentment of every one offering on the
behalf of that estate, not only the goods but the very bodies of the
officers of Courts: for the last estate of the commons, and Deputies of
Towns, Du Mortier stepped up, and having made three great reuerences, he
most humbly thanked the King for the good will which he bear unto his
Subjects, in seeking to preserve them in peace, after resistaunce of the
enemy, especially he approved and greatly praised, the good desire which
he had to settle France again in good order, which had suffered many
disorders thorough the necessity of wars, which notwithstanding albeit that
the poor people were already weakened and waxen feeble in their power, yet
would it rather let it self blood, that after having exposed unto him their
bodies and goods, they might likewise sacrifice their lives for the defense of
the Realm.

After that all the Deputies had finished their propositions, before that the
King rose, the Cardinal of Sens, keeper of the great Seal, kneeled down
before the King bowing down his head very low. Afterward rising up he
returned toward the assistantes, and said, that the King had commanded him
to use this speech unto all the people. That to begin to restore all things
into a good disposition for the comfort and repose of France, every one of
the Deputies of the Towns should set down in writing all their griefs, and
put those points into Articles which had most need of reformation, and then
deliver them into the said Du Mortier his hands. Upon which the King with
the Lords of his Council, would particularly order every one, as he should
see needful, and in such time, as they should be made privy unto. And that
the Deputies should not depart out of the Town, until they had more amply
understood the Kings pleasure. This being said, the King arose, and after
himself being retired, every man took the way of his retreat. Certain
days after the Deputies of the Towns, were sent for to the Cardinal of Sens
his lodging, where they found the Cardinal of Lorraine, with other of the
privy Council. There the Cardinal of Lorraine, delivered unto the Deputies
of the Towns, the end and scope of his assembly, to wit that the King
would borrow three Millions of Gold, and that he would have found out three
thousand persons within his Realm, which might lend him every man a thousand
Crowns, declaring how that the Clergy had already offered a thousand men,
which should lend every man a thousand. That the Towns of France should find
two thousand men, and that the K. would diminish his taxes, for the ease of his
common people which was greatly oppressed therewith. And that there should be
no more custom put upon merchandise for the entertayning of traficque,
charging the said Deputies to do one of the two things, every man to give a
part by him self the Roles of such as were able to furnishe money, and the
other to give in writing to Du Mortier, all such Articles as seemed good unto
them for the reformation of causes. At their departure the deputies consulted
together, and concluded it touching the charge which was given unto them; they
were not able to give any roles of names, for that it was impossible for them
to be able to know the estate of the particular persons: for such a one is
oftentimes reputed to have money which has least. And for to discharge
themselves from giving any such Roles, they went the same day to the
Cardinal of Lorraine, to whom they declared that it was impossible to give up
any such Roles with any certainty, by reason that they were not possibly able
to know and understand the ability and means of the inhabitants: for as
much as some man has store of goods in appearance which has no money at all.
And for the regard of Merchants which work upon their credit, many a one
makes great show, and traficques outwardly, which is near enough at hand to
be come bankroute. Afterward they of the privy Counsel deliberated of the
matter.

Whereupon considering how that the Deputies of Towns, were not able to make
up any true Rowles, thorough the uncertainty of persons habilities, they
concluded that they would charge and task in every Town so many men as
should lend money: and if they were not able to lend a thousand Crowns, then
to lend five hundred, augmenting the number of persons. The fourth estate
afterward gave up Articles for the reformation of causes, according as the
present time required. Briefly in the end the Ecclesiastical estate garunted
unto the King in a pure gift, a Million of Gold besides the tenthes. And the
fouth estate two Millions of Gold, declaring further unto him, that if that
would not suffice to maintain the war, and compel the enemy to harken to
some good peace, they would expose all that remained of their goods and persons
at his service.

Hereupon the King perceiving all his forces to be joined together in one, over
which, and his whole Realm throughout, he had already declared the Duke of
Guise his Lieutenant general, determined that the conquest of Calais, and the
county there abouts should be the first exploite thereof; and so the advice of
those which councelled him to assaie to recover such places as were lost, was
differred until a better season: considering that they were well enough
provided to hold out a long time, that winter approached on; his troops being
come from so far off, especially his men at arms, being altogether weary
with their great pains taking the Summer before. And the whole Country clean
wasted, and especially unprovided of all victual, and fourage, thorough the
continuance of the wars passed. Now as the gentle heart awakeneth, and
grows affected according to the good or evil example of an other, and
chiefly in seeking to do best, when any hatred or jealousy is intermingled,
so this General, being curious to make it appear, that to blot out the
Constables disgrace, he had no smaller means under the wings of his Prince,
then the D. of Sauoie supported by the K. of Spain, endeavored by his long
secret and continual diligence, to take his advantages, as happily as the
Prince of Piemont had done in his former exploits of Picardie. Therefore
undertaking upon his honor, the conduct and final execution of Senarpont
Governor of Boulonnois his old and so often differred secret enterprises (to
the pursuit whereof the Constable marched, had not the desastre of S. Quintins
crossed the course of his good hap,) and perceauing how all things had of a
long time been made ready, advised, that the better to take away any
suspicion from the Spanniardes of his intent and meaning, the Duke of Neuers
should carry half the army into Campaign, giving out that he went to batter
Luxembourge, Arlon, and other places which Frontered upon his government, and
that the other part should remain with the D. of Guise only to hinder any
entire victualling which should be brought to such places as had been newly
conquered. But the Duke of Neuers seeing that nothing presented it self of
sudden taking, that the Spaniard had dispersed his army, in fortefying the
places about Luxembourg, which were evil enough provided, sent back his
troops with all diligence to the Duke of Guise; who in the mean space bending
toward Amiens, as it were to victual D'ourlen, and after to strengthen
Ardres, and Bolongne, found means to understand and learn the passages,
forces, estate and desseins of them of Calais. Where understanding how that al
things remained in the same state, as they left them, with a great promptnes he
presented the choysest of his men before the fort of Nieullay on the first day
of January. Where finding at their ariuall a little fort palissaded and raised
up with earth: which the English men had builded at S. Agathe, a small village
near hand, and at the beginning of the cawsie which leads to Pont de
Nieullay, The port of Nieullay taken from the Englishmen and how.
he caused it to be assaulted by two thousand Harquebusiers chosen men,
seconded with thirty horse, with so great a fury, as having put back an
Ensign of those which kept it, coming out to the skirmish, by favor of the
Cannon, and of the Marish which was covered over with a threescore horse, he
caused them all in the end to abandon it, and retire themselves to the great
forte of Nieullay.

The which at the first bound greatly astonished the English men, for they
expected nothing less then such an encounter, and no ways the French forts to
be either so great or so near at hand. And contrariwise this victory at the
first augmented the others courage, and put them in a great hope of attaining
their principal end, when as they perceived their enemies at the first entry
not to be able to withstand them. At the same instant albeit it grew already
very late, the general and de Terms went to view the port of Nieuillay, and
presently were the approches and trenches begone, into which as soon as the
Artillery was brought, it was planted with all possible diligence, to begin
the battery as soon as day would appear. And for that all the fruit which
they hoped of this effect, did require a great promptness, to the end the
besieged might grow astonished without any leisure to look into themselves,
and to put them clean out of hope of looking for any succor, at the same
time, this Prince caused a part of his army and Artillery to march on the
left hand all along the Downs to occupy them and gain an other forte which
lies at the point of the Downs called Ricebanke, the which commanded and
held all the haven subject, so as no vessel of the enemy could enter in.
Likewise it was very necessary for the obtaining of the Town of Calais
after, to sease at one blow upon the fortes which kept the two passages,
whereof that Nieullay, kept and defended all the causies and passages by land,
part of them being Mareshie, to the end the Flemings might be cut off from
succoring them. And the other which is called Ricebank being taken, would
keep any succors from landing which might be sent out of England, this haven
of Calais, which Casar called Iccius Portus, being distant from the first haven
of England which is called Dover, but five leagues off the Seas, able to be
passed over with a leading gale in two hours. Therefore the Duke of Guise
having all the night, together with the D. D'aumalle his brother, the Marshall
Strossy, De Terms, D'Estre, great master of the Artillery, De Sansac, De
Tauannes, De Dandelot, and De Senarpont reuisited, and well viewed the Downs,
approached yet nearer to the forte of Ricebanke; and all at one instant, the Sea
being very low ebbed, he caused the young Alegre, and an other Gentleman, to
be conducted by Rendan unto a certain place of the port, where he knew
there was a passage, for to sound it. As it was done and speedily dispatched,
it was resolved among all the Captains, to batter and assail these two forts
together at one time. In which Destree travailed so diligently, and caused the
Vastadours and Cannoniers to take so extreme pains, as on the next morrow,
being the fourth of the month, his Artillery was ready planted three hours
before day against these two places, and as soon as day peeped: began to
turn against the Englishmen. The which amassed in such sort those which were
besieged within the fort of Nieullay, as at the second vollie they quitted the
place, and in all have retired themselves within the Town. The Duke of Guise,
having in this sort, made the first passage open, caused the French
incontinently to enter, and be lodged within, where he found a great deal of
Artillery, poulder and munition. Afterward to stop all other succor, which
might by land be brought unto the town, he caused twenty Ensigns of the
French Fanterie, and the Almanes of the Reingraue, with eight hundred Reisters,
and two hundred men at arms, under the conduct of the Prince de la
Roche-sur-yon to be lodged between the Town and the Marish behind the
causees. Leaving besides De Terms, with other companies of Cauallerie,
Gendarmerie, and Zuizers, upon the passage from Guines to the Downs, whether
this Prince with the rest of the army went to encampe. An hour after the
taking of the fort of Nieullay, they which were within the forte of Ricebanke,
yielded themselves unto the discretion of the General, of whom they were
very courteously entreated. The forte of Ricebank rendered up to the Duke of
Guise.
And thus this Prince remained seized, and possessed in one day, of two
principal places, which were of so great importance unto him, and most
necessary for to enjoy his full victory with all. Wherefore pursuing at hand,
the occasion, which so favorably with open arms presented it self unto him,
the fourth of that month he caused six Cannons and three long Culuerines to
be mounted before the water Gate, and to break the flankers and defenses, he
caused the earth to be removed and filled up baskets, and Gabiannades
therewith, as if he had intended to address his principal battery in that
place, having with sundry volleyes of the Cannon disarmed that port, broken,
and rent a sunder certain towers which might hinder him from going to the
breach, which he determined to go in hand withal Holding thus them which were
besieged in doubt, which part they were best to defend, and to provide for,
without doubting any whit at all of the Castle, which was steep, dry, and
without any Rampires; where all at a blow, he planted fifteen Cannons in
battery, charging and discharging all the day long a tempest of Artillery,
with so great a fury, as toward the night the breach grew very large, and
apparent. So as at the same instant before it grew night, the D. of Guise
caused D' Andelot Colonel of the Fanterie, to pass, (with two hundred
Harquebusiers and Corcelets, followed with a number of Gentlemen,) and go
join and fortefie himself all along the Kaye, and breadth of the port, which
was between the Downs and the Town, whether for to come he must necessarily
pass over a little water: ordaining further that as soon as ever he should
become master thereof, every man should be made work, to dig up a trench and
trauerse, The port o^ Calais occupied by D' Andelot and his French companies.
with such instruments as he had caused to be given to all the Soldiers, the
which might trauerse and answer to the Dove, and wall of the Dich, in that
place, which they meant afterward to break up, whereby all the waters of the
diches might sue into the port, and they likewise might go in covert, from
the port unto the diches. Besides the courage, which greatly conducted the
work of the French, the commodity to have every thing ready, and at hand
helped them very much: for they had so long before artificiously provided all
matters necessary for this siege, as especially to cause the men and other
munitions to pass over the Ice, and mareshes, they caused a great quantity of
Hurdels with Pease straw to be brought by Sea, to the end that the water
might not eat, perce, nor corrupt the^. And the better to cover the
Harquebusiers by reason that the sand, and grauel was already discovered and
in view, they had caused a great number of stakes: and Pale-bordes of dry
wood to be brought, of the strongest and lightest they could choose, of a man's
hight, and half a foot in thicknes, covered all without, three or four
fingers in thicknes, with writhed paper one over an other, so as the Harquebuse
could not easily enter, having a rest beneath, at the foot whereof was an
iron Pike, of a foot and an half long to fasten it into the ground how hard
soever it were; behind these blinders the Harquebusiers might shoot easily
thorough a little hole which was in the midst thereof. The D. of Guise seeing
how greatly the breach opened, and that three volleyes of Cannon might make it
reasonable, determined as soon as he could to give the assault. In the mean
time to hold his enemies continually in alarums, Instruments by art invented
for the siege of Calais.
and to stop them from Rampiring any ways, he caused Gramont at eight of the
clock at night upon the ebb of the Sea, to pass with three hundred the best
Harquebusiers of his troops, to go to view the countenance of the besieged,
and with a peale of Harquebuse shot, to dislodge those which should present
themselves unto them. And at the same instant the Marshall Strossy, with other
three hundred Harquebusiers, conducted by the Captain Sarlabos and a hundred
Pioners, went to gain the other end of the port to lodge himself in the
little houses, which were there: and so fortefiyng himself with a good trench
to remain there, and command all the port. Notwithstanding the bullets flew
so hot about their ears, as after five or six soldiers and Pioners were
slain, they were feign to retire, and come back to the General, who was not
far off, having already advanced near unto the port with D' Aumale, and the
Marquisse D' Elbuf his brethren, De Montmorency, and De Bouillon, followed with
many Gentlemen. In the mean time this Prince having caused the breach to be
thrice viewed, as well by Bracasse as by others, and being advertised that it
was time, and that it was ready for the assault without any longer delay,
gave the token, and caused Gramont to advance among the first, with his
Harquebusiers, assisted with as many Corcelets, conducted by the Marshall
Strossy, followed besides with two hundred other soldiers: and himself on the
other side having waded as deep as his girdle, went foremost before the rest
of the troops as far as the foot of the breach. At which the French gave an
assault, with such an hardiness and Impetuositie, as after having cut a
pieces such as they encountered at the first, they constrained the overplus in a
short time to quite the Castle, which they clean abandoned to retire
themselves into the Town. Thus being aduantaged of this passage and first
entry within Calais, the D. of Guise commanded them to fortefie themselves,
and look that they might not be thrust out, leaving D' Aumale, and the
Marquisse D' Elbaeuf, his brethren, their Captains for the rest of the night,
and himself, for that it began to flow, passed over to the army on the other
side, to the end he might send them succors by day break, and to be meet
with any disorder which might chance to happen. When the English men come
again to themselves, and had gotten their wits together, they greatly
repenting the fault which they had committed, in having so suddenly abandoned
the Castle, whereby they saw a full ouerture made for the French into their
town, they returned with a far greater hardiness than before to recover the
peace again, judging that those which were within could not long abide it, and
that they could not be succored, by reason that it was flood, and the sea of a
great depth. Thereupon they came violently upon the French, which attended them
with the like courage, but with more advantage. In sum, they found so great a
resistance made, as they were beaten back with a far greater loss than
before. But remaining full of opinion that they might regain their castle, they
brought three pieces of artillery upon the other end of the bridge toward
the town, to blow up the gate and scour those which should defend it, and
from a platform which was upon one of the corners of the great place, they
shot in an infinite number of Cannon shot, so as it would have been thought
that no man in the world durst have showed himself there, and afterward they
redoubled another assault, more furious than the first. Now if it were well
assaulted, it was better defended, for having lively put them back, and more
than three hundred of their brauest men lying on the ground dead or hurt, the
French in the end shut the gates, and suddenly rampired them behind, upon
which all courage and hope afterward failed those which were besieged, So as
from thence forwards they thought it good rather to parlie, and treat of some
favorable composition, than to make any longer resistance. Wherefore on the
morrow morning Wentworth, who was governor thereof, sent two of the
principallest men of the town to the Duke of Guise, who demanded very great
conditions for their advantage. In the end they stooped and were content with
these Articles.

That they should have their lives saved without any force, or displeasure
offered to man, wife, maid, or child. All the inhabitants of the town should
retire themselves whether they would, either into England or into Flanders,
with such pasports and safe conducts as should be thought necessary for their
surety and passage, my Lord Wentworth remaining with fifty such other
prisoners of war as the Duke of Guise would choose out. And for the rest of
the men of war, they should be bound to pass over into England. They should
leave behind them the artillery, powder, bullets, armor, ensign, and
generally all kind of munitions, as well of war as victualles, within the
town, without breaking, burning, hiding, or endemnifying any thing at all. As
for gold, silver, money, or not money, goods, moueables, merchandise, and
horse, all should remain in the discretion of the Duke of Guise to dispose of,
as it should seem best unto himself.

All which things being accorded on the eight of January, this Prince began
to put out a great part of the people out of the town, and the rest followed
according as it was promised, without having any wrong or disturbance done
them, without any one Englishmans remaining there. But well an incredible
quantity of powder, artillery, munition, wolles, and of all sorts of
victuals, which were staide, and the surplussage given in pray to the
soldiers. After this manner, and in less than seven days space, was Calais
and her fortresses conquered, which as the^ was esteemed impregnable, before
which (as the Chronicles of France do witness, during the reign of Phillip
the sixth, named De Valois, and in England, of Edward the third) the English
army laid siege during the space of one whole year. In the end they which
were besieged with in the town, were driven to so great a necessity and
famine, as they were feign to eat rats and hides of leather, John de Vienne
commanding there, it was yielded the third day of August 1347. whereby the
English inioyed it two hundred and ten years, during which space they bragged
how they carried the keys of France at their girdle, being able by this
means to enter and depart the realm at their pleasure. But as one Phillip
king of France lost it, so did the French again conquer it from another
Phillip king of England. It was only enclosed with stone walls, full of round
towers, joining near one another, first builded for spear and shield,
arrows, or any other instruments of war without fire, after the old
fashion, and without any rampires, Description of the Town of Calais.
or other devises or subtilties, such as are now a days invented against the
force of our artillery. At this hour it is judged to be one of the fairest
and strongest towns of war in all Europe. For as much as besides the
natural situation thereof, in a place inaccessable, for that it is environed
three parts with rivers, brooks, and marshes, and the fourth side defended
with the sea, with a great and spacious port, not being subject or to be
commanded by any thing. The art and invention of man has given unto it a
form more square than otherwise, new clothed without with great, large, and
massiue rampires, having at the three corners toward the marish three great
bulwarks, in point triangle-wise, well flanked and armed to cover and defend the
curtines. And on the other square toward the downs stands the castle, by
which, for that it was not known, or the imperfection not remedied, grew this
last taking of the town. Besides, this town is wholly environed with large
ditches, and marvelous deep, with springs at the very bottom, always full
of water, by reason of a little river which comes from Hames, which passing
thorough the town, waters them, and fills them full, as well as all the
rest of the little brooks which break out of the marshes, fall down, and
few thither for the most part. But which is more praise-worthie in a town of
war, there is one of the fairest square public places as is possible to
behold, in which at the least may be put in battle between four or five
thousand men, and the revenue and profit of the port must needs be better,
for that it is one of the principallest and most renowned towns of the Ocean
sea, whether there is brought from all parts of the world an infinite and
inestimable riches, and of all sorts of marchandises, and from thence likewise
they are distributed into sundry other Countries. Now whilst that they
battred the town, the thunder and brute of the artillery being heard within
England, the Queen to remedy the same, caused a number of ships to be
prepared, which she furnished with soldiers, and all kind of munitions fit for
any succor to be sent thither. But when they approached, and already
perceived the colors and white crosses to wave upon the tower of Ricebanke and
walls of the town, without coming any nearer, they returned back to carry
report thereof home into their country.

The town of Calais being surprised in so short a time, Guines and Gr. line
as it were two soldier support Cala^.
there grew afterward some disputation to which of the two they should
address themselves, either Graueline or Guines, for so much as these two
fortresses seemed to be like two shoulders to support the town, and as two
strong bulwarks to close up the two principal passages thereto, to wit,
Graueline for Flanders, and the low Countries, and Guines for France.

Notwithstanding these propositions being amply debated of and discussed, the
more sound opinion resolved, that Guines imported much more for the
conservation of Calais than Graueline, although it were far stronger and of
more difficile access. According to which advice, the General of Guise,
without giving any great leisure to the enemy to bethink himself of any
remedy, pursuing near his victory, the thirteenth of this month besieged
Guines, where Gray commanded, with a good number of men of war, and all
other kinds of munitions requisite. At their arrival the French finding the
town abandoned, lodged there for their better help, toward the battering and
assault of the fortress which was joining thereunto. But the Englishmen
surprising them as they were grown into a great disorder about their lodging,
sallyed out at a posterne gate of the castle, and thrust them out upon the
first fury, setting in spite of them the better part of the houses on fire,
and afterward retired: but the D. of Guise caused them to begin the breaches,
albeit the Artillery gave impediment enough thereunto. So as with an obstinate
assurance, and without intermission he caused the work to be pursued. Where
he himself, to augment their courage and to serve for an example to every
one, was ready with the first, and had his Mattocke as soon ready in his hand
to make way for the Cannon as the meanest Pioner in the troop. And in such
sort continued in preparing the ground and dressing up of Gabionades, as within
three days after, he approached and put the mouth of his Artillery to the
number of thirty five pieces of battery, just upon the border and
counterscarpe of the diches, to batter as well point blanke, as traversing in
three places principally, one of the greatest and principallest bulwarks, which
flancked on the one side the Courtine of the Gate, and on the other their great
bulwark which they called, the keape, undertaking at the first one of the
strongest of the bulwarks, in hope after to obtain better cheap some of the
less and smaller sort. Thus very sudainely began the battery. The which
endured without cease two days and a half, in such a fury, as within so
short a space there was discharged between eight and nine thousand shot of
Cannon. In such sort, as this great bulwark being opened and disarmed, the
breach by the 20. of this Month appeared reasonable for the assault. But the
D. of Guise for all that, knowing by how many ways and devises a breach might
be repared, and the means and subtilties which the enemy might invent, to
entrappe them which should make the assault, and to fortefie himself within,
before that he would hazard his Soldiers, thought it good to make the breach
more then once to be veiwed, Guines besieged the 13. of January.
and what kind of access was made, for to go up at. And therefore at the first
blow he sent four of his most disposte Soldiers which he could choose out,
followed with twenty other resolute men, who were incontinently retired by his
own commandment. The next morrow he sent again five Soldiers no less
aduenterous then the first. The which gave very good hope for the coming to
the breach: yet not trusting to al these reports, for that he would not upon
too light a credit, make a sudden frycassie, of so many valiant men's lives,
as lightly are the foremost in such an exploite, he sent again six score
French soldiers, to gain and preoccupy with the first the top and highest
part of the Parapet, which was on the assaylants side, that thereby they might
cover, and help up a certain number of Pioners, which he caused to mount up
with the same tracke, for to plane, and make the mounting up to the breach more
easy, which was as yet very high and rough, commanding all these aduenterers
notwithstanding, that they should not undertake further then they had charge,
which they obeyed, gayning with a great number of blows, and hazard of their
life, the top of the breach. In the end standing assured, that the way was
prepared, he commanded D'Andelot general of all the French Fanterie to be
ready with his soldiers, that as soon as the token should be given, he might
readely present himself to the assault. And he for to view with his eye the
beginning, and such issue as should ensue, and if it were possible to discern
within the breach, and behold the fashion of the men within, mounted up a
little Hillocke high enough to discover, that for to sustain and defend that
breach, there needed not so many men as the first thought for. Wherefore all at
the instant he caused a regiment of chosen Almanes to march straight to the
breach, to open the first passage thereof, who with great assurance, and
without any fear of harm were there overthrown. By the like means he made
sign to D'Andelot that he should follow him with his troops which he did, for
altogether made a marvelous stir to enter; the most part of the Soldiers
plonging and entering within the water, and diches of seventy foot in depthe,
with such an heat and desperate hardines, that they forgotte all danger,
albeit that the Duke of Guise had caused bridges to be builded ouerthwarte the
diches, with pipes, and caske linked one to an other, upon which they had cast
plankes and juice, and bound them fast together. All this notwithstanding such
a vehemente furye pushed them forward, as they had no regard neither to
bridge nor passages, through the very desire which they had to enter. And yeat
their impetuositie was not so great and furious, but that at the first bound
they were repulsed, the enemies greatly helping themselves through their
artificial fires, and fighting for their life with a strange and incredible
obstinacy. The which the Duke of Guise perceauing, came down the little hill,
and thrusting himself into the midst of them, reprehended some, solicited
other, and prevailed so far with the rest, as he restored in such a sort
their heart into their bellye, that turning their face, and beginning a fresh,
they redubled with such a courage, and fell to it with so great a force, as the
beseaged fainted under the burden, being no longer able to sustain this last
charge: so as being overthrown, they abandoned the entry and left the
breach to the French and Almanes, with the loss of more then three or four
hundred men, among whom there were found near hand four score Spaniardes
of the brauest men, and of best reputation: As the rest turned their backs,
and were either slain in the fury or taken prisoners, the same day the
Almanes of Colonel Reicord conducted by his neuew, did on the other side force
two little bulwarks, which had likewise been battered, where the breach was
made, and so was the base court of the castle wholly gained upon the same day.
The governor Gray, before this loss, foreseeing the danger which was likely
to ariue, had retired himself with a son of his into the old Castle, and
their principal forte, which they called the Bulwark or keep, as were in
like sort the principal Captains, and best soldiars. And had transported in
with themselves all their richest moueables. All they having a while bethought
themselves of their work, and finding themselves unable to resist against the
fury of the French, determined to parley. And the governor Gray sent the same
day two gentlemen to the Duke of Guise, to declare unto him that in defending
of that place, being of so great mark and importance, the keeping whereof had
been committed to him, he ought not to find it strange nor in evil part, if as
an honest man and according to his duty, he had well defended it, so far as to
have endured the assault: If he should have don otherwise it had been against
his honor and faith, requiring him in the end to deliver unto him, an honest
composition. This Prince having understood his propositions, differred answer
until the next morrow, albeit that some counseled him to take him at his
word, considering that he stood as yet upon his feet and almost as strong,
as at the first, having besides this old Castle whole and entire of a most
strong and ancient matter, environed with most deep dyches, and full of water
where they must needs make a new batterye, and where it was possible to
retrenche it, the place being spacious enoughe: Besides that there rested the
great and large Bulwark of the keep, which commanded all the rest, the whole
being garnished with artillery and mu^itions and defended by the best advised,
and valiantest men that were. Then on the morrow being the one and twenteth of
this month, the Duke of Guise accorded this composition. That the Soldiors
should depart with their arms, but that their enseignes should remain in the
place, with all artillerye, powder, bulletts, and all other kind of munition,
as well of war as victuals. As for my Lord Gray, and all the Captanes of
quality which he had with him, they should remain prisoners of war, in the
power of the King and of the Duke of Guise. This capitulation being received
and approved by the besieged, the day following there departed thence between
900. and 1000. men of war, part Englishmen, part Borguignons, and a number of
Spaniards, besides the common sort, which took every man such course as
himself listed, frank and free without any harm or displeasure done unto
them, three or four hundred dead and hurt remaining behind. Mondragon a
Spanniarde.
Gray was retained prisoner, so was Mondragon a Spanish Captain, who having
been before prisoner in the Bastile of Paris, saved himself, and was again
committed to ward thither. That done the Duke of Guise, for that this place
seemed very dangerous if it should be taken again, and greatly noisome to
the high way from Calais into France, especially in being so near unto
Ardres, and that it would be a double expense to keep it, having caused all
the Artillery munition and victuals to be taken out, caused it to be ruined
and razed: in the year 1351. The town and Castle of Guines, were taken by the
Englishmen, notwithstanding the truce which then was, by the conspiracy and
treason of one named Gilliaume de Beau Couroy, Lieutennant to the Captain of
that place, who for this cause, was beheaded, and afterward hanged. Now there
rested no more of the whole county of Doye, but a little Castle called Hames,
which was not restored into the Kings obedience. And for that this Castle,
albeit that it was little, and not rampired nor fortefied by any art, was
notwithstanding naturally seated in so strong, and as it were inaccessible a
situation, as being environed with Fleetes, Motes, and Maresches, having but a
very narrow cawsie to pass over into it, and that in many places crossed
with wooden Bridges broken and taken away, it was almost impregnable to be
gotten from men well furnished and resolute, they were in a great doubt after
what manner they might besiege it. In the mean time Sipierre, to whom the
keeping of this cawsie was committed, having the Duke of Lorranes company
whereof he was Lieutennant, and some other, Hamas Castle abandoned.
advertised the D. of Guise, that they which were within Hames, being frighted,
and dismayed at the taking of Guines, had abandoned it, and were fled away by
night, thorough certain by-pathes which they only were acquainted with all in
the Maresches. And so it fell out very easy to be seized, where they found
much Artillery and provisions. Afterward the French remained in all, and
thorough all masters, and there was neither forte nor Castle, which was not
yielded unto them, or abandoned: so that besides the Country which the Duke of
Guise conquered over the Englishmen, and the rich booties which were found
therein and taken, there were gained near hand three hundred pieces of Brass
artillery, all mounted upon cariages, and as many of iron.

The K. in his parliament at Paris.
After this the King having kept his bed of justice, with the Dauphin and the
rest at the Parliament of Paris, and caused a number of Ordonances concerning
his own estate to be proclaimed, visited Calais with the King Dauphin,
leaving there De Terms as governor, with charge to perfect the fortifications
such as you see them at this day. The K. army dismissed.
Afterward the rygor of the winter enforced him then to dismiss his army
for to refreshe themselves all saving such troops as he distributed into
Garrisons, where he thought most need, resolving to redress a new army at
the spring. There was the charge of the light horse bestowed upon the Duke de
Nemours, at the instance of the Duke of Guise, whom he caused to be
preferred, before the Prince of Conde, who at the same time and before had
demanded this charge, whereupon he grew very malcontente: then the King went
to Fontaine Bleau, whether Anthony de Bourbon, Duke of Vendomis, and as then
King of Navarre, thorough the decease of the King his late Father in law, came
unto him, Mademoiselle de Rohan.
showing himself besides much offended with the D. of Nemours by reason of the
Damoiselle de Rohan, cousin German to the Q. of Navarre, who maintained that
he had promised to marry her, and upon that sued him in the Arches. D. of
Neuers.
The D. of Neuers being tickled with the good hap which accompanied the Duke of
Guise, gave the Rende-uous at Yuoy to all such troops as he was able to
assemble together within his government: where having let them all to
understand, how that there was no place more enemy, nor of greater importance
the^ the Castle of Herbemont, in being the principal place, where all the
enemies bands assembled together, and retired from their enterprises, he
resolved to carry it away. Therefore having caused it, that night to be
enclosed round with the light horse, the next morning the army lay encamped,
ready to batter the place, after they had well viewed it thorough hot
skirmishes, under the favor whereof, they had gained as far as the Court,
and quickly after was mounted and planted a part of the artillery to batter
down with Cannon, out of the flankers of the Castle. But when they perceived
how little they prevailed thereby, by reason of the hard and bad situation
thereof, they planted the Cannon, right in front and at the head, to batter a
bulwark, which covered and defended the only passage and entrance unto it,
which they shot off so furiously, and bestirred themselves so well in so short
a space, albeit that the breach was not sufficient to give the assault to, as
the desired parlie, upon some conditions. But being deceived in his demands,
and a short answer being made him by this Prince, how that he should speak of
no other composition, then yield to his mercy, The Castle of Hebermont yielded.
otherwise that if he made not good have, he should instantly be cut in
pieces, with all his, albeit that he was nothing so near danger, as the
faintness of his heart imagined, trusting in the bounty of this Prince, he
notwithstanding yield himself unto his mercy: of which at the entreatie of
Iametz he found experience, the D. of Neuers using such sweetness, as to send
him away with his wife, and family, and generally all the rest of the soldiers
which were within, their lives and goods saved, without being any ways pilled
or ransomed. This done, the Prince sent a number of light horse, and
Harquebusiers on horse back, to view the ports of Iamoigne, Chigny, Rossignol
and Villemont, part whereof they found already abandoned, and the rest yielded
at the first summons. They were determined to have gone yet further forwards,
and to have given as far as Neufchastel in Ardaines. But the raynes, snowes,
and great frostes broke off their desseins. Now the only taking of this Castle
of Hebermont, ought not to be placed among the least, for besides that it is
naturally strong and easy to be made inexpugnable, as being situate upon a
high and hard rock, on all parts inaccessible, saving by this passage, by
which it was battered, yet is it most proper and convenient for the assuring of
the whole passages of the Ardenes, all the Champion over, and seconding the
strong Castle of Bouillon, to hold in awe all the fortes, of the long forests
of Ardenes: it appertains to the comte Bilisten, and the Rochefort, to the
keeping whereof: was appointed the Captain de la Croix, Lieutenant to
Haute-Courte.
