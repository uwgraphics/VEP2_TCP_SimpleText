A Declaration made by my lord Prince of Conde, to show and declare the causes
that have constrained him to take upon him the defense of the Kings
authority, of the government of the queen, and of the quietness of this
realm, with the protestation thereupon requisite.
ALthough it be their part which arm the^ selves first by their own
private authority, to give a reason and cause of their doing: Yet the Lord
Prince of Conde considering how much this present stir and tumult, by reason
of diverse circumstaunces, is subject to many and sondrie judgments, besides
that the common damage requires a sure and speedye reamedie, thought it good
to prevent al sclau^derous tales and misreportes, and to declare as here
follows, the causes which have moved him to associate him self with his
kynsfolke friends, and servants, for to do service unto the King, to the
Queen, and to all this realm, in their great necessity and need.

Every man knows, that after the great troubles happened about matters of
religion (where with it is most manifest that many abusinge the natural
goodness of our kings, have served their own turns to establishe and to
maintein their greatness and honor). Finallye in the month of Ianuarye last
paste, there was and edicte or decree made by his majesty, to rule and order
both the parts, with the advice of the most notable and best chosen assemblye
that the king could chose in all his parlements.

This decre and commandment being shortly after published, in the most part
of the parlements of this Realm, gave a great hope of rest and quietness as the
effect declared: and no doubt, if ye parliament of Paris had not used such a
delay, the tranquillity of ye town and of the whole parliament thereof had
been, and should yet have been much more then we se it now to be.

The let of this publication has engendered by just occasion diverse
suspicions, that that was not done without great practice which tended to a
further end, which thing was confirmed by the goings and commings and drifts
of the prouoste of the Merchants of Paris, with the parcialities that every
man knew to be between the presidents and counsailers of the said court. Also
yt all men knew how the Constable being sued unto and laid upon by certain
parcial Marchau^ts had filled the^ with a certain hope yt this decre concerning
religion, should not continue long: Notwithstanding, yt moved not ye said lord
prince any thing at all, nor yet others of the reformed churches, to say or do
any thing that should trouble the common quietness of this realm: but in the
middst of an infinite number of violences and outrageous wrongs whereof they
could never have justice, they have tarried and looked for the issue of the
publication with the greatest modesty and patience that they could.

This publication being made at Paris with great, earnest, and importunate
suyte, and rather by prayer and request than by the commandment of the king
or of the queen. The said lord prince after a grievous sickness, took his leave
of the king and the queen, in hope to rest him self a while at his house.

In the mean time news were brought of the cruel and horrible but cherlye
slaughter committed at Wassye in the presence and company of ye duke of Guyse,
where were most tyrannously slain many of the kings subjects, as well men as
women and children, which were assembled together to hear a Sermon, and to
pray unto God, following the religion and pure word of god, which ye said lord
prince main tayneth with them, and trusts to maintain unto death, by all
means lawful.

This cruelty thus reported at Paris, moved in sundry wise, the one party and
the other, in such sort that there was even at that time great likely hode
that some great mischefe would ensue of it, the rumor being spredde abroad
that the said Duke of Guyse came in armor and with a great company being
determined to root up and destroy all the congregations which they call of
the new religion, the which also for their part, consydering that the kings
decre and ordinance seemed not to be able to maintain them against the force,
violence and rage of their enemies, stood at their defense having first sent
to the Queen certain men of learning and virtue, for to demand of her
justice for the murder committed in the said place of wassy. This was the cause
why the said lord Prince being at that time in good hour arrived at Paris,
for to go to his house, and desyringe to remedy the inconveniences that
threatened the town of Paris, went at the commandment of the Queen to meet
the king and her at Monceaux, where he told them what he feared, and advertised
them that for the avoiding of trouble it should be good that the Duke of Guyse
whom men said did come with great power, and with a great company armed
withsta^dinge the kings decree and ordenaunce, at the lest should not pass
through the said town of Paris, which thing was found good by the queen and
upon occasion she wrote unto him with her own hand.

Now the said Prince hoped that the said duke of Guyse would have obeyed the
Queen, and which is more, that in laying a side his weapons would have
submitted himself with all his company, to the order of justice equalye
observed in this realm, as well in the behalf of the lest as of the greatest
when they be accused of any crime, and that he would have come straighte to
the king and the queen with all humility, according to his duty: But it
chanced clean contrary, for making no other answer, but that he was busyed at
Mantuil in feastinge his friends, he went straight to Paris with a very great
company of his kinsfolk and friends, and servants, and others, with open
armor. And he may not go about to excuse him self for taking the said armor
and gathering such a company together for fear yt he had of them of ye
reformed churches wc men call Huguenots which is as much to say as
heretics. For it is well known that before the murder at Wassye. he marched
with weapons forbidden by the kings decree and ordenaunce. Also that the most
part of them that did accompany him had been long before called together by
him, and by others, out of al places of this realm, so that long before there
was no talk at Paris but of that, and of his coming.

Furthermore, knowing that those of the reformed churches took the way of law
and justice according to their duty, it appears plainly that if he had not
sought but his own saftie, he would have gone strayghte to the court
according to the commandment of the King and Queen.

It appeared also, yt this coming was practiced of long time before: because
that not only the company of the Constable and diverse other which in the mean
time were gathered together, did join themselves with him but: also the
provost of the Merchants with a great troop of the said town went to
receive him, and this entrey was made in open armoure with great acclamation of
men hired and suborned, as if the king him self had entered in person. The
Duke of guyse nor any of his band not showing any sign or toke^ that they
were displeased any thing at it.

Now the said lord prince being returned from Monceaux the day before, as is
said, fully determined to go on his journey toward his house, and being
soddenlye advertised of the coming of the said duke of Guyse with such a
company and route armed, determined like a prince of the blood royal for the
service of the kings Majesty, and the profit of the common wealth, to see
and provide for that which the sodeynesse of such a matter required,
following the prayers and instaunt request of an infinite number of poor men,
fearing that it should happen to them as it did unto those of Wassye. And for
this cause and effect, where as he never thought of any such thing before,
finding in his company a certain small number of gentle men, then meting
together at Paris about certain affairs, professinge the same religion that
he does, prayed them to acpany him to the preaching of godds word, appointed
and furnished as much as was requisite for their own defense, with all
modesty, honesty and simplicity. And all this company was but.CC. horse,
compting the gentelmen and servants of the said prince: others also there were
dwelling in the said town, haunting ordinarily the preaching of the word of
God, which went and came without offendynge any man in word or deed.

The morrow after, because that the said Duke of guyse in stead of going
straight to the court began to fortifye him self more and more in the said
town, the said lord prince did also the like for the defense of those of the
reformed church ye which seemed (with Just occasion) to think that all the
said force and strength was against them, consydering the late deed of Wassy,
and that there was in this realm no war beside the common report, that men
went about to make at Paris a new decree formably contrary to the first.

Besides all this, you must note that the said Duke of Guyse, contynuyng his
course and trade with the Constable and marshall Sayncte Andre and certain
other of their companyons without the authority of the King and queen and
which is more, not making them pryuye to any thing, although the state of
the realm required not any extraordinarye prouisyon, kept nevertheless his
counsel still, wherein sat certain presydents of the court officers of the
kings, the prouoste and Bourgeses of the town, even as though h^ had been
master and lord of this realm. A thing truly very strange, and suffycient
to declare and show, that there was among them some practyses and secret
enterprises. For as for the constable he was departed from ye court six weeks
before being greatly discontend with the queen, because she would not endure
nor suffer his strange facions and manner of doing.

And since that time, for to revenge him self, being departed from his house
to go to Paris to hold this goodly counsel, met the King and the Queen in
the way neither saluting them, nor yet staying for them made as though he had
not known them.

On the other part also, the marshal of Saint Andre not long before these
things was not content to disobeye the express commandment yt the Queen had
given him to go furthwt to his charge of government but in the open counsel,
answered her so arrogantly and prowdly that men might easily perceive yt he
leaned upon some counsel, and priuye intelligence.

More than this, the said Duke of Guyse even at the beginning of his coming
to Paris in stead of going straight to the court, did employe all the friends
he had, and sought all means he could to keep the Queen at Fontayne bleaux,
for fear she should go to Orleans. Yet nevertheless having obtained that
which he had most instantly required, he sturryd not for all that from Paris:
and helped him self with a new excuse, because that the said Lord prince
was there also accompanied with a great number of gentle men, and that the
town fearinge to be spoiled and saccadged had desired and prayed him to tarrye
there for to defend it, and thus doing he has priuilye rebuked the said
Lord prince of to vilanous an intent and purpose. But the contrary was sone
perceived.

For the said lord prince to take from him all pretense, or color in any
thing, by and by offered him by the Cardynall of Bourbon his brother and
governor of Paris to go out at one gate when he should go out at the other.

And than afterward being aduertysed that the Queen desired that both the
companyes might go out, and that for this purpose the King of Navarre should
be come into the town of Paris, he was so ready and willing to obey this
commandment, that although he had been sick the space of two days in his
bed, yet he departed quyckely with his company strayghte toward his house
of la Ferte, from whence he hoped to have sent them away incontinent if the
said Duke of Guise had done the like.

Now the said Duke of Guyse clean contrary sheweyng in effect with his
complyces, that by the willing departure of the said Lord prince, he had
gotten that he looked for, went to the King with all his force and armyed power
as in ye time of war and against his greatest enemies, a thing truly, not
seen nor used, neither is it in any wise to be allowed or accepted considering
the base and tender age of the king, and that the Queen his mother although
she be endued with a singular virtue, and constance could not chose but be a
frayde, with a Just fear, seeing her self beset round about with such force
and power to gyther with the King Duke of Orleans, and my Lord chanceler
contrary to her will and express commandment, whereof of sufficient proof
may be made by the tears that fell from our kings eyes, and by the talk
that he had being forced to suffer him self to be carried to Meleum these days
late past. The which it shall please them to remember that were present. So
that such a coming of the said Duke of Guise, and ceasing upon the persons
of the King, and queen his mother, and of the Duke of Orleans his brother,
ioynynge herewith all the foresaid things, it can not be, nor ought to be
esteemed other than a taking and captivity of them, and that ye most hurtful,
most miserable and shameful, that ever chanced or could chance to this
Realm. And upon this it may please the Queen (mother) to remember the
admonicion and counsel that was given her by a certain Portugal, together with
a man of Spain, and another sent out of Sauoye, as touching yt which she now
at this day feels and finds true, to the great and extreme grief of her
most obedyent subjects and servant. And to the intent that this may be yet
better known and understood of all true subjects and faithful servants. The
said lord prince besides that he declares things past desires al me^ to be
advertised of the enterprises which is very easy to conjecture and gather,
which the fordsaid men do pretend to execute, to the intent that if they be
put in effect by the^, no man can doubt but yt they are very enemies to the
king and to his crown, and on the other side if there be other let them have
so much the more certain means to declare and show it in abstaining from
such enterprises. That is, that having beset, and then carried to Meleum ye
king, the queen the young duke of Orleans, and those which they thought good
with armed men, to enjoy them at their pleasure they entend to help them
selves with their authority against the said Lord prince, and all other
which withstand and resist their enterprises, declarynge them culpable of that
which they them selves have already partlye executed and done, and whereof the
said lord Prince need not take the pain to excuse him self: seeing the
experience and proof shows sufficientlye that all the days of his life he
has myslyked and despised all that they have sought and sewed for, that have
grown and increased so sone into such an honor and greatness, that there is
none but Judges with all the states of this realm that it is much more
reasonable to demand of them the cause of it, than it can be easy for them to
give a reason why.

And if the said Duke of Guyse with his, find themselves vnfaulty in this
behalf, they shall do much for them to purge themselves of it according to ye
request that ye estats have made therein, in stead of troublynge both heaven
and earth, and to give this occasyon to men to think that they fear nothing
more than to enter into this matter.

The occasyon of that counsel is euydente enough, to weete to the intent
that all lettes being taken away, they might dispose and rule the realm of
France at their pleasure, and for as much as to attain to these end and
purposes, they know they must have other aid and shores, men say that their
drift and policy is, to root up and destroy all those of the reformed
churches, that is to say all they that resist them, in making a certain new
decree at their own will, by the means of certain hired and suborned persons,
as well of the Parliament of Paris as of else where, to the intent that the
other part should be as it were indebted to them, in ruynynge at the least
half the realm, for to have it rather half at their desire, than to see it
enjoy whollye the quietness and rest so much desired of all good men, and as
rejected of those which never made their profit but with the loss and damage
of another man, and of the ruin of the commons.

THE protestation.
THese things considered with many other which time shall discover yt said
lord prince protests this that follows before the king, ye queen, and the
states of this realm, with ye realms, potentates, lords, friends, and
allies, of this Crown, and generally before all Chrystendome.

First that the only consideration of that which he owyth to god and to his
church, with the zeal yt he has particularly to ye crown of France under
the government of the queen, and finally the hartye affection that he bears
to the quietness and tranquillity of this realm, co^straine him to seek all
lawful means according to gods law and man's, according to the order and decre
yt he has in this realm, for to deliver out of Captivity the person of the
king of ye queen his mother, and my lords her children and to maintain ye
keeping of ye kings decres and ordena^ces, and specially up on ye matter of
religion, set up, and made by ye advise of the princes of ye blood ryall,
lords of the counsel presydentes and conselours of the parlements, saving the
said men of ye house of guise which now will trust and believe their own
particular aduises. It cannot fail to be such as me^ se it to be if it were no
more but to justify ye cruelty more than barbarous, which was committed in the
said place of Wassye. Also the said lord prince with a good number of other
princes, knights, lords of the counsel, captains, gentillme^, men of war,
me^ of Justice, and law, merchants, and men of the three estates of this
realm, most affectuously besecheth and requires with all his heart all good
faithful and trusty subjects and servants of his majesty carefully and
diligently to see, read, and way al these foresaid things, for fear that lest
unawares in stead of succoring and ayding the king the queen and my lords her
children, in their captivity they be by ye practices and false aduertisements
of the enemies of ye peace and tranquillity of this realm, brought to be ye
ministers of ye destruction of ye same. And to prevent and wtstand these things
he prays them to help him and to stay up the crown of France now fallen
down if god of his infinite mercy lift it not up again whereunto after having,
called upon his grace he craves ye aid ye assistance and favor of al ki^gs
princes and potentates alyes and confederates of this crown the wc he takes
al for beholders wyttnesses and Judges of his fidelite, and integryte, in the
co^seruation of the state of ye king, whose inuocencye full of al good hope
has not deserved to be i^ captivity of those which by ye benefits of his
predecessors and fathers have been raised up in authorite, so that now they
should so manifestly conspire ye ruin of the son, of the queen his mother,
and of all the estates of this realm.

Moreover by this present protestation he means with all his company to
declare him self pure and innocent of the blood shed and of the calamites and
myseryes wherwyth this realm is threatened through the partyculare ambytyon of
those which having nothing to do but to look to the government of this
realm are comme unto it them selves by arms, for to chase them out whom both
gods law, and man's did call unto, and which were borne counselours. Against
the violence of the which distourbers and disquyeters of this realm, breakers
of the decrees, and ordenances of all the estates, he entendeth with all his
company to bestow and to spend his body and goods unto his last breath as a
good and faithefull subject and servant of the crown of France, and
specially being of the house of France.

Also because the said men will not fail to abuse the auctorye of the king
and ye Queen whom they keep in a miserable and unworthy Captiuitye, for to
serve their own turns against the faythefull and trustye subjects of his
majesty. For this cause the said lord prince protests and declares
presently that he will not credyte any letters, messages co^mandeme^tes, decres,
ordenances, whatsoever they be made by the said men under the name of his
mayestie. For as much as it is well known that they shall be forced and gotten
by manifest violence, against all law of God and man. For, that accepted, the
lord prince will never give place to any man, lyuinge in the humble obedience
that he owes and will give to his majesty, and to the Queen his mother.

More, as touching the king of Nauare his brother, the said Lord Prince
protests, that with the band of brotherly love, and ye particular respect
that he owes unto him, he means to acknowledge hi^ after the order and
degree that he has in this realm, with all obedience next to the king and
Queen, which by the common consent of the states, the agreement of the Princes
of the blood royal, the approbation of the parlements of France, has
received ye governance of this realm as also he is assured yt the said king
of Navarre consyderinge these foresaid things will have such regard to it as
reason and the present necessyte requires.

The which also the said lord prince most humbly and most instantely
besecheth him to do.

Also the said lord prince to show that he speaks syncerly and truly
protests, presently that in stead of coming to hand strokes he is ready
to unarm him self upon these conditions following, which are so reasonable yt
they cannot be refused but of those, that prefer their own gain before the
quietness of this realm. That is to weete, that the king and queen, ye Duke
of orleans, my lord chauncelour, and other of ye counsel be first of all set
again at such liberty and safftye as they ought to be: which thing cannot be
done until all weapons be laid aside under the name of the king, and in the
hands of others than of those which follow the said men of the counsel holden
at Paris.

Further more that the said of the house of Guise, the constable and marshall,
of S. Andre be sent again to their houses, and that they have a day and place
appointed them to come and appear before ye king and the queen to offer
themselves with al humilite as they ought to do, for to render a reason of this
that is before said, and likewise of that which was laid against them before by
the estates of this realm. For ye which it is most reasonable and necessary
that prouisyon be made by the king and the queen. And the said lord prince for
his part offreth likewise to make account and to Justify him self of all yt
men can lay to his charge or to them of his company, when and before whom it
shall appartayne,

given at Orleans the seven day of April in the year of our Lord. 1562.
