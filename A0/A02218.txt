The Popes pitiful Lamentation, for the death of his dear darling Don Joan of
Austria: and Deaths answer to the same. With an Epitaphe upon the death of the
said Don Joan. Translated after the French printed copy. by H. C.
The Popes Lamentation.
O Heaven, O Earth, O Elaments,
and all therein containde,
Lament with me, power forth your plaints
just cause has so co^straind,
Since cursed Death, in cruel wise,
has reft me my delight:
Don Joan of Austria* he that sought,
by all the means he might,
To save my church and me from harm*
to strengthen my estate,
And with his power, to punish those
that did my doings hate.
Mine eyes send forth, your brinish tears,
more cause you never had:
Since he is d^ad, whose douty deeds
erst made my heart full glad.
Now let my Halles be hanged about,
with mestfull morning weed^:
For plea^a^t things, procure my pain,
d^lights my dole do breed.
Come, come, my careful Cardnalles now,
my Prelates and the rest:
That wonted were to wish me well,
I pray ye all be pressed.
To wail with woe, the want of him,
that during term of life:
Neglected naught that might be wrought
to make our glory rife.
Alas how am I gript with grife,
what cares do compass me:
For loss of him, whom I ordainde,
my Champion chief to be,
To ^ight with those yt were my foes,
whom I had handled so,
That he beleeude I was a God,
as well as many more,
That with my charms I did inchau^t
to find his like again
In all the world, who so should seek,
would labor loose in vain.
And for this cause I called him,
to state of hye degree:
Provoking him to that which should
for my preferment be.
Full well my couenau^ts could he keep
my laws and statutes large,
My Bulls, and pardons, pleased him well
they wear his cheifest charge.
And therefore Death, I curse thee now
and eke thy cruel dart:
Which did to that renowned Prince,
thy p^ysoned power impart.
These Huguenots thou might have hitte,
to pacifye thine ire,
And let this worthy wight alone,
to further my desire.
Thou have not only stricken him,
but diverse more beside:
As by thy deadly Darte appears,
that in their blood was di'de.
Thy furious force from me remove,
and straight thy strength extend
Upon a Prince whose name I hate,
at him thy battry bend.
So shall my sorrow somewhat cease,
but gr^ater griefs will grow,
If thus thou seek against me and mine
thy rigorous rage to show.
FINIS.
Deaths answer.
CUrse me as much, as care thou can,
I way it naught at all:
Each earthly Wight I can constrain,
to come when I do call.
The s^ruaunt o^ the living Lord
(...) am and must obaye
His heavenly hests, who^ he commau^ds
I must without delay
Deprive of life, my pearsinge Darte
must execute his will
On all that bide within my bounds,
not one can escape by sk^ll.
Both Princes, Lords and lo^ty Peers,
I quickly can constrain
To follow me, and quite forgo
their goodly gorgious train.
Thy self that say thou art a God,
to blind and bl^are men's eyes,
Shall pass the path that others do,
no means thou may devise.
To shonne the snare, but with the rest
thou must my rigour^ taste:
If I intend to touch thee once,
thy waile^ull words are wast.
Though frant^ck fools thy court frequent
from contryes far and ne^re:
And honor thee as God on earth,
to make thy pomp appear^:
Whereby they rob the living Lord,
of all his honor quight:
I Will pull thee from thy princely throne,
and master thee by might.
Thy treasures nor thy tripple crown
thy Iems and Iwels rare,
Cannot corrupt me so, as I
thy cursed corpse will spare.
When I shall call thee from thy pomp
that pampreth thee in pride,
Then shall I laugh to see thee loathe,
my doleful doom to bide:
For so my common custom is,
when with my deadly darte
I strike those wightes, that one the world
have wholly s^t their heart.
Alas says one, a stat^ly house,
repl^ate with riches rare,
A dainty dame, whose dear delights,
can comfort all my care,
And store of goodly ground I have,
well grown with grass and grain
Fair flocks of sheep, and feeding beasts,
with all that may maintain
A happy life: yet must I dye,
and leave them all behind?
O heavy hap, what greater grief,
might ever grype my mind.
Another says, I have a wife,
whose bewty does surmount:
Fair children fraught with natures gifts
which makes my joys to mount*
Above the clouds: and there withal
such gubbes of gold I have,
with plate and precious stones such store
as heart can wish or crave:
Yet nothing may my ransom pay*
nor me from death redeem,
He reaks not riches, every one
he does alike esteem.
Poor people are not found so fond,
my furious force to fly
No means they seek, but when I strike,
they gladly grant to dye.
And therefore had I rath^r far.
the ritch^r sort assail:
That I my self might merry make,
to see them weep and wail.
FINIS.
Don Ioans Epitaph.
DOn Joan of Austria here entombed does lie,
that was the worthy warrior willo^ named
Who prowdly did of late, his power apply,
the fatal foil of Flaunders to have framed.
Of stomach stout, and hawghty heart he was,
and made his vaunt the Emperors son to be*
But yet the thing, he thought to bring to pass,
the living Lord has frustrate made we see.
The first of October. 1578.
L'acquis abonde.
FINIS.
