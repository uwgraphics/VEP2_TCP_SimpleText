A Thanksgiving and Prayer for the safe Childbearing of the Queens MAJESTY.
O Eternal God and merciful Father, since lineall Succession is under thee
the great security of Kingdoms, and the very life of peace: We therefore give
thee most humble and hearty thanks, for the great blessing which thou have
begun to work for our Royal King Charles, and this whole State, in giving the
Queens Majesty second hopes of a long desired Issue. And as we give thee
hearty and bounden thanks for this; so we humbly pray thee to perfect this
great blessing thus begun, to preserve her from all dangers, and to be with
her by special assistance in the hour of Travel. Lord make her a happy
Mother of successful Children, to the increase of thy Glory, the comfort of
his Majesty, the joy of her own heart, the safety of the State, and the
preservation of the Church and true Religion amongst us. Grant this even for
Jesus Christ his sake, our only Savior and Redeemer, Amen.
