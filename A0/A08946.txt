(...) For which fact he, his wife, and the other woman, were executed at
Lanceston, last Lent Assizes, (...) in chains near unto the place where the
murder was done.
To the tune of the Ladies daughter.


A Cruel Cornish Murder,
I briefly will declare,
^^t your attention further
my Story wondrous rare,
And do not think it is feigned,
because it seems strange,
What has not Satan gained,
when men from God do range?
At Crowen in that County,
an old blind man does dwell,
Who by good peoples bounty,
did live indifferent well,
By name he is ca'ld Ca(...)wall,
his house stood all alone
Where ^^pt this deed so cruel,
the like was scarce ere known.
He had a proper Damsel
that lived with him, his daughter
To whom some suitors came still,
and in true Wedlock saught her,
Because the news was bruited,
how that the blind man would,
Though he were poor reputed
give forty pounds in gold.
Oh, thou bewitching money,
What mischief does thou cause,
Thou make men dote upon thee,
contrary to Gods Laws.
What Murder is so heinous,
but thou can find out those,
Who willingly for gain thus,
will venture life to lose.
Nay often soul and body,
as in this Story rare,
By the sufferance of God, I
will punctually declare:
The fame of this man's riches,
a Uagrant chanced to hear,
In haste his fingers itches,
away the same to bear.
This bloody murderous Uillaine,
whose fact all manhood shames,
Did live long time by stealing,
his name was Walter James,
Who with his wife, and one more
young woman, and a boy,
Three Innocents in purple gore,
did cruelly distroy.
The twenty sixth of July,
when it was almost night,
These wanderers unruly,
on this lone house did light,
The old blind man was then abroad,
and none but his old wife,
And a little Girl, in the house abode,
whom they deprived of life,
At first they asked for Uittle:
quoth she, with all my heart,
Although I have but little,
of that you shall have part;
He swore he must have money.
alas, here is none she sed;
His heart then being stony,
he straight cut off her head.

he did her intercept.
(...)(oh stony-hearted wretch)
And into the house he brought her:
(what sighs alas I fetch,
To think upon this Tragedy)
for he with mischief stored,
Cut off her head most bloodily,
with the piece oth' broken Sword.
Thus did three harmless innocents
by one vile Caitiffes hand
With both the counsel and consents
oth' woman of his hand:
Their heads and bodies laid they
all very close together,
And being gone a little way,
they did at last consider,
That if the house were burned,
the murder might be hid,
With that they back returned,
and as they thought, they did,
Setting the house on fire,
which burned till next day,
Full many did admire,
as they went on the way.
These murderers suspected
that people would have thought,
Those three ith house enclosed,
unto their deaths were brought,
By accident of fire,
but God did then declare
His power (...) let us admire
his wondrous works most rare.
The murdered corpse remained,
as if no fire had been,
Their clothes with blood besmeared
not burnt, as might be seen:
The leg and arm oth' Maiden,
were only burnt in sunder,
Full many people said then,
in the midst of their wonder.
That surely there were murdered,
by some that robbed them had,
And presently it was ordered,
that for this deed so bad,
All Uagrants on suspicion,
should apprehended be,
And in this inquisition,
one happened to see,
Some clothes upon the parties,
that from this house were taken
And soon before a Justice,
the little boy told plain,
All things before that passed:
also the boy did say,
James was ith mind to kill him,
lest he should all betray,
They taken were at Meriwicke,
forty five miles, or more,
From Crowen where the murder was
about a month before,
(...)
Where in the Iayle they lay,
Until the Lent Assize did come,
which took their lives away*
The little Boy was quitted,
and sent unto the Parish,
Where he was borne, well fitted,
with clothes and food, to cherish
Him, as he ought with honesty
and leaves his wandering trade*
The other three were (...)'d to dye,
on that which he had said.
But Walter James denied,
that ere he did that act,
Forswearing (till he dyed
and when he died) that fact
His wife at her last ending,
confessed the bloody guilt,
So monstrously offending
when so much blood was spilt.
The other woman after
confessed more plainly all:
James took his death with laughter
and nere to God did call:
Thus as he lived a reprobate,
and did God great re(...)t,
His soul wc Christ bought at dear rate,
in death he did neglect.
He was hanged dead at Lancestone,
among the rest that (...),
Then carried where the deed was done*
and by the highway side,
He hangs for example,
in chains now at this time,
Thus have I (...)
discourse of this foul crime.
Objection may be framed,
where was the old blind man,
Whom I have never named
since when I first began.
He was abroad in the interim,
when this mischance befell,
Or else the like had hapt to him,
but he is living still,
And goes about the Country.
to beg, as he before
Did use, among the Gentry,
and now his need is more.
All you that are kind Christians,
think on this bloody deed*
And crave the Lords assistance,
by it to take good heed.
