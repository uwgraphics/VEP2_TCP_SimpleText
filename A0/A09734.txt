A Treatise of the way to life, divided into three parts.

The first part shows how, by sin we have deserved Gods curse.

The second part shows me, how we are freed from the curse, and the law
satisfied.

The third part teaches us, what duetyes and thankfulness we owe to the
Lord, for this benefit of our redemption.

Imprinted at London by Thomas Dawson.

The first part shows our misery, and how by sin we have deserved Gods
curse, and eternal damnation.
Q TO whom do thou profess thy self to belong?

A To the living God Genesis 1.1. Act. 14.15.
maker of heaven and earth: whose Ephe. 2.10.
workmanship I am, for that he has made and created me.

Q. Wherefore has God created thee?

A. That I might serve to Ephe. 1.4.5.
his glory, by doing his will in Ephe. 4.24.
righteousness and holiness all my life.

Q. Did God then create man that he could do his will?

A. Yea verily, for he created man Genesis 1.27.
to the likeness of his own image, in true Col. 3.10. Ephesians. 4.24.
holiness and righteousness.

Q. Can thou then of thy self do his will, and keep his law?

A. Nothing less, for in Romans 5.18.
Adam we are all fallen from the state of innocence, and Ephesians. 2.3.
are by nature the children of wrath, Romans 3.23.
and void of all grace, Romans 6.20.
and servants of sin.

Q. What is sin?

A. It is the breach 1. John. 3.4.
or transgression of Gods law.

Q. What is the reward of sin?

A. Eternal Romans 6.23. Mat. 25.41.46.
death and damnation both of body and soul.

Q. How come thou to the knowledge of sin?

A. By Romans 3.20. and Romans 7.7.
the law of God which I find my self not able to perform, and therefore am
guilty of death.

Q. What is the law of God?

A. It is a rule of perfect obedience, 1. The. 4.1.3
teaching us how to walk and please God, contained in the ten commandments.

Q. Rehearse them.

Exodus 22.
A. God spoke and said: I am the Lord thy God, etc.

Q. What means this Preface: I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of
the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

A. I note first, that God sets down his authority before his law saying: I
am the Lord, moving us to fear him alone: secondly, adding thy God, he gives
forth most loving promises of his mercies concerning this life, and the life
to come, to move us to love him alone, and trust only in him: thirdly,
repeating his benefits, he adds matter of faith and thankfulness.

Q. How is this law divided?

A. Into Mat. 22.37 39. Luke 1.75 1. Table.
two principal heads, 2. Tables.
or tables.

Q. What is contained in the first table?

A. Luke 1.75. Mat. 22.37. Ephe. 4.24.
Holiness, or the true woorship of God, commonly called our duty to God,
contained in the first four commandments.

Q. What teaches the first commandment: Thou shall have none other Gods
before me.

A. It teaches us to honor Deuteronomy. 6.4.
God alone, that is to worship him with Deuteronomy. 10.12 20.
fear, to believe in him, and call upon him through faith, and testify our
Deuteronomy. 6.5. Marc. 11.30.
love toward him with thanksgiving, having our Luke 10.27.
soul, heart, mind, and thoughts, consecrate unto God, and forbids us to
Deuteronomy. 18.9.10.11.
hear false teachers, or to regard sorcerers, witches, or any such.

Q. What teaches the 2. commandment, Thou shalt not make to thy, etc.

A. It teaches us that we should not liken God to Leuit. 26.1.
any creature whatsoever, nor woorship him in any similitude, neither after our
o^^e phantazie, or by good intentes, not grounded on his word, but only John
4.23.
in spirit and truth, after the true Deuteronomy. 12.32.
rule of his word.

Q. What teaches the third commandment, Thou shall not take the name, etc?

A. It forbids us to Ier. 5.7.
swear be any creature whatsoever, or by Gods name Leuit. 19.12
falsely or Eccle. 19.1.
rashly, but in Iere. 4.2.
truth, judgment, and justice, with all Deu. 4.8.58
reverence of his name, and charge us with the care 1. Cor. 10.31. Col. 3.17.
of gods glory in hearing, speaking and thinking of his word and works, and
in all our doings.

Q. What teaches the fourth commandment: Remember thou keep holy the
Sabbath, etc?

A. We are taught to Act. 20.7.
assemble to hear Gods word, and use his sacraments with Romans 4.11.
faith and Mat. 3.2.6
repentance, and to pray to him also to Esaias 56.2 and 58.13.
rest from sin, and our own ways, to profit in true mortification and
sanctification Exodus 31.13
which God works in his Saints.

Q. It seems then that these four precepts teach the true service due to
God, now tell me what is taught in the second table? The 2. Table.


A. The second table teaches us Luke 1.75 Mat. 22.39 Ephe. 4.24
righteousness, or our duty to men in the Lord, containing the six last
commandments.

Q. What learn we in the first commandment: Honor thy Father, etc?

A. We learn to fear, love, Leuit. 19.3
and obey our Parents, Exodus 22.28
Princes, Romans 13.1.2
Governors, teachers, 1. These. 5.12
Pastors, Masters and Leui. 19.32
Elders, and all our betters. Finally, it teaches all superiors to be as
fathers to their inferiors, and the inferiors to obey in the Lord.

Q. What teaches the sixth commandment, Thou shall do no murder, etc?

A. It teaches us to shun al occasion of discord, in thought, deed, and word,
all quarrelling, fighting, Leuit. 19.17 18. 1. John 3.15
hatred, or desire of reuengement, and teaches to do Mat, 5.43.44.
good to all men, even to our enemies.

Q. What teaches the seventh commandment: Thou shall not commit adultry?

A. It forbids all Ephe. 5.3.
fornication, Leuit. 18.12
unorderly, and wanton lusts, Ephe. 5.4.
talks and songs, proud Deuteronomy. 11.12
apparel, lechery, drunkenness, excess and Ezec. 16.49
idleness. Finally, all occasions leading to uncleanness, and requires all
soberness, chastity, and temperancie.

Q. What teaches the eight: Thou shall not steal, etc?

A. It forbids all Exodus 25.14 17.
deceit, Ier. 8.10.15
covetousness and 1. These. 4.6.
injury in any dealing, and in all callinges, and commands all true and
Leui. 19.13.
just dealing in judgment, measure, and weight, and teaches every man to be
content with his estate Ephesians. 4.28.
and to help others.

Q. What teaches the nienth commandment: Thou shalt not bear false etc?

A. It forbids all Exodus 23.1. Psalm. 15.3.
hearing, and Leui. 19.16.
speaking of slanders and untruths against our neighbors, all flattering,
lying, vpbrayding, and dissembling, and charge us with the care of the good
name of our neighbor, and charitablie to witness the truth to the
establishing of love.

Q. What teaches the tenth commandment: Thou shalt not covet thy, etc?

A. It teaches yt not only a consent to the desires of evil, is sin, but
the motion of sin it self is against Gods Romans 8.7. and 7.7. Gal. 5.17.
law, and bewrays our concupiscence, and conuinceth us of the breach of the
law.

Q. Since then that we cannot observe the law, to what use serves it?

A. To show Gal. 3.19
man his weakness, to Romans 3.20 and 7.7.
accuse and condemn man, and makes the faithful to Gal. 3.24
flee to Christ, and acknowledge the free grace of God to be the only cause
of their health, it increases the knowledge of Gods will in them, Gal. 2.16.19
humbles the flesh, and stirs up the spirit to Heb. 8.10.11
obedience by Gods spirit, which makes the law Psalm. 19.17
profitable and sweet to the faithful.

The second part teaching how we are freed from the curse, and the law
satisfied.
Q. BY what means then is the law satisfied, and this curse answered for us?

A. God of his infinite Ioh. 3.16
love, in the Gal. 4.4.6
fullness of time, sent his son made of a woman, and subject to the law, and
redeemed us from the slauerye of it, 2. Cor. 5.19
reconciling us to God by not imputing our sins unto us, and so was Romans
8.3.4 2. Cor. 5.21
made sin for us, that we in him might be righteous before GOD, and so Gal.
3.13
freed from this curse, and the law satisfied.

Q. It seems then that we obtain not righteousness by the law.

A. No verily, but Gal. 2.16. and 3.11.12.
by faith in Jesus Christ, Genesis 15.6 Romans 4.13.16
in whom our faith is counted for righteousness.

Q. What is faith then?

A: It is a certain Ephe. 4.13. 1. Ioh. 5.23
knowledge and sure Mar. 11.22
persuasion of the free good will of God toward us in Christ, Heb. 8.10
sealed in our hearts by his spirit.

Q. How come we by faith?

A. By Ioh. 17.8.20 Romans 10.17
hearing the word of God preached.

Q. Have we faith then by bare hearing of the word?

A. No, but it is the Ioh. 6.44 Ephe. 6.23. and 2.8. Phil. 2.13
work of Gods spirit in us.

Q. Is faith then needful?

A. Yea, Mar. 16.16 John. 8.24
for without faith we cannot be saved.

Q. What profit then have we by faith?

A. We are Romans 3.23. and 5.1.
justified thereby and John 1.12. Gal. 3.26.
made the sons of God.

Q. Rehearse the sum of this thy faith?

A. I believe in God the Father almighty. etc?

Q. What is the brief sum of all this?

A. I learn four things: first that God Genesis 1.1 Ephe. 4.6 Deuteronomy. 32.58 Mat.
2.10.
the father is creator and preserver of al things in heaven and earth.
Secondly, that God the son Ioh. 3.16.17 Gal. 4.5. 1. Ioh. 2.12
is redeemer of the world. Thirdly, that God 2. These. 2.13 1. Pet. 1.2.
the holy Ghost is the sanctifier of his people. Fourthly, that by this means
GOD has Ephe. 5.26
purchased to himself a Church, and made it holy to serve his glory in life

Q. Are there three Gods that thou namest, God the father, God the son, and
God the holy Ghost?

A. No verily, but Ephe. 4.6
one only eternal God, in one essence and being, yet Mat. 4.16.17. and 28.19
1. John 5.7
distinguished in three persons, because of their several operations, effects
and properties.

1. part.
Q. Why is the first person in trinity called father?

A. Because he has Genesis 1.1.
created all things, and Ioh. 20.17. 1. John 3.1.
adopted the faithful to be his children in Christ.

Q. Why is he said to be almighty?

A. Because his power is over all things, and rules them all by Ier. 10.13.
He. 1.3. and 11.3 2. Pet. 3.5.6
his word.

Q. Why is he called maker of heaven and earth?

A. Not only because he made heaven and earth, and all things in them, but
also because he Esaias. 40.26. Ier. 10.12.13
orders, and Esaias 42.5.
preserves them all by his providence.

Q. What follows in the second article, 2. part.
and in Jesus Christ his only son our Lord?

A. Here begins the history of our redemption, wrought by the second person
in trinity, God the son.

Q. What signifies this word Jesus?

A. It signifies Mat. 1.21
a Savior.

Q. Why is Christ called a Savior?

A. Because he Mat. 1.21
saves his people from all their sins.

Q. What does this word Christ signify?

A. It signifies anointed, and is so called because he was anointed with
Psalm. 45.7 Ioh. 3.34.
the holy Ghost, to be the Luke. 1.32
king, Psalm. 110.4 Heb. 4.14.
priest and Luke 24.10 Heb. 1.2
prophet to GOD his father.

Q. What is his kingdom?

A. It is spiritual and John 18.36
heavenly, whereby he governs his church by his word and spirit, and Col.
1.13 Heb. 2.14
triumphs over Satan's kingdom in Col. 1.22 Heb. 1.3 1 Pet. 2.24
his own person for us.

Q. What profit have we by his kingdom?

A. We have Luke 1.71.74. Romans 8.2.15
liberty of conscience, regeneration, Ephe. 6.16 Apoc. 12.11
strength and victory against Satan, death, hell and sin, and finally, are
made Ephe. 4.7.8.
partakers of Christ his graces and spiritual treasures.

Q. Why is he called a priest?

A. Because he was the Heb. 2.17 and 9.11.12
true high priest, to offer his own body a sacrifice for our sins.

Q. What does his priesthood profit us?

A. It assures us that he is our Romans 8.24 Heb. 7.25
mediator, to reconcile us to God, and satisfy for our sins, and to Romans 5.2
Ephe. 2.18
make an entry for us, to come Romans 8.15
before our God with boldness, to pray to him, and Heb 13.15 1. Pet 2.5
offer spiritual sacrifices.

Q. Why is he called a Prophet? Esaias 55.4 Heb. 1.1.


A. Because he is the full interpreter of his Fathers will unto us.

Q. What profits it us to believe this?

A. Much verily: for hereby our faith is stayed on the John 3.33.34 Heb. 1.2.
and 2 3
doctrine of Christ, so that we look for no other doctrine or revelations then
his gospel though Gal. 1.8.
revealed from heaven by an Angel.

Q. Since thou call Christ the only son of GOD, how is it that the
faithful are also the sons of God?

A. Christ is only the son John 1.18. and 3.16.
of God by nature, Gal. 4.5.6. Ephe. 1.5
the faithful by grace and adoption in Christ.

Q. Why is he called our Lord?

A. Because he is the Ephe. 1.22. and 4.15. Col. 1.18
only head of his Church, and Apoc. 17.14.
ruler of men and Angels, and we are assured of his defense.

Q. What teaches the 3. Article: which was conceived by the holy Ghost,
borne of the Virgin Mary?

A. It teaches that as Christ was Romans 9.5 Col. 2.9.
perfect God, so he was also perfect Mat. 5.25.
man Gal. 4.4.
borne of a woman, yet by a holy seed, that he may Heb. 2.11.
sanctifye others.

Q. Was it needful that he must be both God and man?

A. Yea, or else he could not be a Savior for man, for the Gal. 2.9.
godhead dwelt in him bodily, that so in Heb. 2.14.
our nature, he might by death destroy the power of Satan and sin, and Gal.
3.13.
bear our curse.

Q. What profit have we by his manhood?

A. Christ therein discharged us He. 2.14.17
of his fathers anger, and in taking our nature, John 1.16. Ephe. 2.5.6.
parts to us his graces.

Q. What learnest thou in the fourth article: He suffered under Pontius
Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried: he descended into hell.

A. We learn what anguish of death Christ the 1. Pet. 3.18.
just suffered on the cross for us that are unjust, that we might be healed 1.
Pet. 2.24.
by his stripes.

Q. Wherefore did Christ thus suffer and die?

A. For our Romans 4.2.6
sins.

Q. What profit have we by his death?

A. The Ephe. 1.7
forgiveness of our sins, the Romans 6.5
mortification of our flesh, and Col. 1.20
the appeasing of Gods wrath.

Q. What means his descending into hell?

A. Even this, that for a time Esaias 53.3.5
he felt his fathers wrath, and the Act. 2.24
dolours of eternal death in his Mat. 26.38 42 Luke 22.43. Heb. 5.7
soul and conscience here on earth, that he might be a redeemer as well of
the soul as of the body.

Q. What teaches the fifte Article: the third day he rose again from the dead?

A. It teaches that Christ Col. 2.15 Heb. 2.14 1. Cor. 15.57
overcame death, and brake the kingdom of Satan for us.

Q. What use have we of his resurrection?

A. We have Romans 9.25
justification, a 1. Cor. 15.20.22
gage of our immortality, and Romans 6.4
newnes of life.

Q. How art thou assured that thou art in Christ, and have part in his death
and resurrection indeed?

A. By this, that Romans 8.9 2. Cor. 5.5 1. John 4.13
God has given me of his spirit, which To. 8.10.11
subdueth sin in me, and so Romans 8.13. and 6.6
mortifieth my flesh, bringing me in hatred with sin and Satan, and for
that I feel Romans 6.4
sanctification, and a new life to be begun in me by his resurrection, which
certifieth my conscience, that I am in Christ, and so of God.

Q. It should seem then, whosoever taste not at all of true 1. Ioh. 3.3.6
mortification, and newness of life, howsoever otherwise boasting of the
mercies of God, of Christ's death, and forgiveness of sins by him, yet has
he no part in the redemption of Christ?

A. It is very true, for as Romans 4.25
Christ dyed for our sins, and rose again for our righteousness, so he
restores strength to the faithful Romans 6.6.18 ^. Pet. 2.24.
to subdue sin in some measure, and to walk in a new life and righteousness
here on earth.

Q. Now tell me what follows in the sixth article: He ascended into heaven,
and sits on the right hand of God etc?

A. We learn that Christ having accomplished, all that was needful for our
salvation, went into Mar. 16.19 Act. 1.9
heaven with his body, and Heb. 10.12
stays there til he come to judgment.

Q. Has Christ then clean forsaken his Church?

A. No, but is present with his Mat. 28.20 John 14.16.17
in spirit, to the end of the world.

Q. What means the sitting at the right hand?

A. The right hand is taken for the power of God, noting that Christ has all
Mat. 28.18 John 17.2 Phil. 2.9 Heb 1.3.5
power of his father, both of things in heaven and earth.

Q. What profit comes to us by his ascension?

A. Heaven is Ephe. 2.6
open to the faithful, which our sins had shut up, and we are assured that
Romans 8.34
he is our mediator, and by this means John 7.39. and 16.7
the holy Ghost is given to the faithful,

Q. What teaches the seventh article: From thence he shall come to judge both
the quick and the dead?

A. We learn that 2. Cor. 15 10. Apoc. 20.12
all men, both good and bad shall appear before the tribunal seat of Christ.

Q. Have we any comfort or profit by this?

A. Yea, for it is happy that he which has saved us, shall judge us, for he
shall come to acquit and Col. 3.4
glorify the faithful, but to judge and condemn the 2. The. 1.8 10
unbelievers and disobedient.

3. part.
Q. What teaches the 8. article: I believe in the holy Ghost?

A. This article teaches that the third person in Trinitye, GOD John 6.63 and
14.26. and 16 13
the holy Ghost makes all this profitable to the faithful, and 1. Pet. 1.2 2.
These. 2.13
sanctifies and John 3.6.8
regenerateth them to be new creatures, and a holy Church unto God.

4. part.
Q. What follows in the 9. article: the holy Catholic Church, the communion
of Saints?

A. This concerns the fourth point of our faith, assuring us that Psalm. 125.1
GOD has his Church on earth always.

Q. What signifies this word Catholic?

A. It signifies universal, noting that Christ's Church Mat. 8.11 John 10.16
is dispersed in all places, and yet but Col. 1.18.24 Ephe. 4.15.16
one body of one head which is Christ.

Q. Why is added the communion of Saints?

A. To show the 1. John 1.3
fellowship which ye faithful have with Christ, and with themselves in ye
Ephesians. 4.3 13
unity of faith, and one mind, teaching us Act. 4.32
to communicate our graces one to another.

Q. What are the true marks of ye visible Church?

A. The sincere Romans 10.14 15
preaching of the word, ye true ministering Act. 20.7
of ye Sacraments, Genesis 12.8 Psalm. 65.1 Psalm. 18.4.4
prayer, and discipline, according to the word.

Q. Can there be no Church where any of those do want?

A. Yes indeed: although blemished, for the word preached, and Sacraments
truly ministered, show that there is a Church, for they are a token of Gods
face and Act. 10.33 Heb. 4.12.13
presence, and the printes of the Ezekiel. 43.7
soles of his feet.

Q. It should seem then that the Romish Church is not the true Church, having
neither the word sincerely preached, nor the Sacraments perfect, neither in
substance nor form, and their discipline clean besides the word.

A. It is very true, neither can the family of love be the true Church,
refusing the vocal word, vocal prayer, banishing the Sacraments, and true
discipline.

Q. Show me the meaning of the tenth article: the remission of sins?

A. It assures us of the Psalm. 32.1.2 Ephe. 1.7
free forgiveness of all the sins of the believers, both of the fault and
punishment.

Q. Do we not merit forgiveness of any one sin by works?

A. No certainly: but Christ Act. 13.38.39
alone is the full satisfaction Tit. 2.14 1. John 1.7
for all our sins.

Q. Are not works then needful, since they do not merit?

A. Yes, nothing more, first, to testify our Col. 3.17
thankfulness and 1. John 5.2
love to God, and to Tit. 3.8 Iam. 2.18
prove our faith: secondly, to 1 Pet. 2.12
give good example to men: thirdly, to Mat. 5.18 1. Cor. 10.31
glorify God. Fourthly, to assure our conscience that we are the sons of God.

Q. What teaches the eleventh article: the resurrection of the body?

A. We are assured that the Job. 19.25
bodies of the faithful shall rise to behold God, and Phil. 3.21
shall be made like to the glorious body of Christ, and their souls
immediately after this life Eccle. 12.7 2. Cor. 5.6.7
return to God.

Q. Do noe the wicked rise also?

A. Yes verily, both the Act. 24.15
just and unjust, the just to life, and the wicked to death and judgment. John
5.29


Q. What understand thou in the eleventh article: the life everlasting?

A. I understand, that after this resurrection there is no more change, but ye
faithful John 3 36
shall live with Christ for ever in joy, the wicked shall be without Christ
Mat. 25.46.
in eternal pain.

Q. Then all this teaches us that the obedience of the law is only performed
by Christ, in whom we are freelye justified through faith, wrought by Gods
spirit, which gives us the true knowledge of GOD and his mercies in Christ,
in whom only we please God, and our obedience is acceptable.

A. It is even so.

The third part teaches us what duties and thankefulnes, we owe to the Lord
for this benefit of our redemption.
Q. By what means is this faith and obedience nourished or increased in us?

A. By Romans 10.17 Gal. 3.2
hearing of ye word of God, by the true Romans 4.11
use of the Sacraments, and Romans 8.15 and 10.14
by prayer, by which means also we testify our faith and obedience, and
glorify GOD.

Q. Do these of themselves nourishe our faith?

A. No, but only Romans 8.6 ^ Cor. 3.18
Gods spirit makes them effectual unto us.

Q. How is our faith nourished by the word?

A. By diligent Romans 10.17
hearing, reading, meditation, conference, Act. 20 32 He. 10.24.25
exhortation, and application of the word, assuring us of the truth thereof,
and of Gods promises, Iam. 1.21
submitting our selves wholly to the same, that it may be Romans 1.16
a word of power unto salvation in us.

Q. What is a Sacrament?

A. It is an outward Genesis 17.11 Romans 4.11
seal joined unto the word which visibly represents unto us spiritual
things, and assures our faith of Gods promises declared in his word.

Q. How many Sacraments are there?

A. Two: Baptism, and the supper of the Lord.

Q. How does Baptism profit or nourish our faith?

A. First, by assuring us that we are Romans 6.3 1. Cor. 12.13 Gal. 3.27.
one with Christ. Secondly, that we are John 3.3.5
begotten again Col. 2.11
from sin, into a new life. Thirdly, by being a pledge Tit. 3.5
of the forgiveness of our sins, for as the water cleanses the body, so our
souls by the 1. Pet. 3.21.
blood of Christ are purged from sin.

Q. What profit has our faith by the Lords supper?

A. Even this, that as outwardely we 1. Cor. 10.16 and 12.26
receive the bread and wine to nourish our bodies, so inwardly we receive
Christ by faith, even as our own, whose Col. 1.14.22
body and blood cleanses us from sin and nourishes us to eternal life.

Q. Do we receive the very body and blood of Christ reallye in the bread?

A. Nothing less, but only John 6.63
spiritually by faith.

Q. How shall we receive this Sacrament woorthily or profitably?

A. When we come with faith and repentance.

Q. How shall we know that we come with faith?

A. First, if we acknowledging our own poverty and wants, confess the
mercies of God 1. Cor. 11.24
with thanksgiving: secondly, when we assure our selves of the Mat. 26.28
forgiveness of our sins by the death and sacrifice of Christ only.

Q. How shall we know yt we come with repentance?

A. First, if we 1. Cor. 11.28
examine our hearts, and are truly Psalm. 32.5.6
grieved for our sins, Mat. 3.6
confessing them before God: secondly, when we Mat. 3.8
walk in a new life, that is, in holiness to God, and true love to our
neighbor, Mat. 5.23 24
reconciling our selves one to another, and Mat. 6.14 15 Col. 3.13
forgiving, that we may be forgiven.

Q. What differs Baptism from the Lords supper, since they both betoke^ the
remission of sins?

A. Baptism grafteth us into Christ by regeneration in hope of remission of
sins, the supper nourishes us, 1. Cor. 12.13.
being grafted to feel the power of the death and resurrection of Christ daily
stre^gthening our faith into a new life.

Q. What is prayer, which is the third means to increase our faith?

A. It is to ask all good things of God by faith, and to give him thanks for
all things received.

Q. How does prayer nourish faith, when it is rather an effect or exercise of
faith?

A. It nourishes it when we having asked, do also obtain, and so our faith
is strengthened and comforted, but it is an effect of faith, because where
faith is, Romans 10.14
there follows prayer and thanksgiving.

Q. What is required in true prayer?

A. Eccles. 5.1 1. Tim. 2.8
A pure affection to GOD and his word, a Genesis 32.10 Luke. 18.13
true feeling of our own unworthiness, wants and sins, asure Iam 1.6 Mat. 7.7.
faith in the favor and promises of God, and to ask all things Romans 8.28
according to his will.

Q. Are we thus prepared to prayer of our selves?

A. No, but Gods Romans 8.15 26 Gal. 4.6
spirit only teaches us to pray faithfully, and Heb. 11.6
without faith prayer, is not acceptable.

Q. Rehearse the Lords prayer?

A. Our father which art in heaven. etc.

Mat. 6.
Q. What means these words: Our father which art in heaven?

A. Herein God assures us, first of his fatherly love to bolden us to prayer:
secondly, adding (in heaven) he assures us of his great power, and lifts
our hearts to seek him in heaven.

Q. What require we in the first petition: Hallowed be thy name?

A. We pray for grace, yt we may glorify God in his word and works, and in
all our doings, and that his name may appear glorious even as it is, all
ungodliness being defaced.

Q. What ask we in the 2. petition: Thy kingdom come?

A. We pray yt God would by his word and Ephe. 3.1^
spirit, govern and increase ye number of his elect, and yt 1. Cor. 15.24.25
Satan's kingdom may be utterly confounded.

Q. What ask we in the 3. peticion: Thy will be done in earth as it is in
heaven?

A. We pray that we may obedie^tly resign our wills to Gods will, yt he would
Psalm. 51.10 11
create new hearts and affections in us by his spirit, and we pray for the
grace of 1. These. 4.3
sanctification, that as the Psalm. 103.20
Angels in heaven do willingly please God in all motions, so we may study to
1. These. 4.^
please him on earth.

Q. What ask we in the 4. peticio^: Give us this day our daily bread?

A. We pray that God will Prou. 10.22 Deuteronomy. 28.10 12
bless all things that he has lent us on earth, and to teach us to Psalm
145.15 16 Mat. 4.4
wait on his providence in all estates of life, that he will cause all things
to serve our necessities, and the furthering of us in our callings Leuit. 26.20
26.34 Ezech. 4.16. and 5.16
without whose blessing they al perish and want their uses and effects.

Q. What ask we in the 5. peticio^: Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive
them that trespass against us?

A. We here call on God for the quiet estate of our own conscience, and for
Ier. 31.33 1. King. 8.33.36
the forgiveness of our sins, to be confirmed in us by this, that we Mat.
6.15 Luke 11.4
are willing to forgive others, and we pray also that we may have patience to
Mat. 5.23 Col. 3.13
forbear and forgive others offending us.

Q. What ask we in the 6. pet. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us
from evil?

A. We pray that God would give us his spirit to increase our faith, that we
may 1. Cor. 10.13
overcome the motions and temptations of sin in us, that sin Romans 6.12
may not reign with us unto death, but that we may be freed from it more and
more, Romans 6.18
and set at liberty to serve righteousness.

Q. Does God lead into temptation, that we pray he would not lead us into
temptation?

A. God does Iam. 1.13
not tempt to sin, but he is said to lead into temptation, when he Esaias
63.17
withholdeth his graces from men, or gives them over Romans 1.24 26.28
to a reprobate sense, or Exo. 9.16 Romans 9.18
hardens their heart, Psalm. 81.12 Esaias 29.10
by leaving them to themselves, but God Psalm. 125.5 Heb. 3.13
stays his children from this extremity, which else are ready to run to
all sin, and therefore needful to pray that God would not lead us into
temptation.

Q. What means this which follows, For thine is the kingdom, the power and
glory, for ever and ever?

A. It is a confirming of our faith in the power of God, to teach us that all
come of God his goodness, and not of our selves, and therefore that all should
redound to 1. Cor. 10 31.
his glory by our Psalm. 50.14 and 102.18
thanksgiving, which is the Heb. 13.15.16
only service that pleases God.

Q. Now tell me briefly the sum of all this which thou have said?

A. First, we learned by the law, yt we al have cast off the image of God,
whereunto we were created, and are become by nature sinners, children of wrath,
deserving Gods curse, and damnation through our transgressions.

Secondly, we learn that ye means which answered this curse, and took away
damnation from the faithful, was the only death and sacrifice of Christ, who
by his spirit daily restores the image of God in the faithful, and works
faith, and obedience in them.

Thirdly, we learned that by the practice of faith and obedience we should
glorify God in his word, Sacraments, and by prayer, by making all our life a
thanksgiving and praise unto God for all his benefits in Christ. Which grace
God for his Christ's sake grant to me and all his people. Amen.

B. A.

A brief and short prayer containing the sum and effect of this Catechism.
O Eternal God and most merciful father, we thy poor servant do humbly
acknowledge before thy presence our manifold and grievous sins, whereby we
have broken thy most holy law, and have justly deserved thy curse, and
eternal death and damnation: yea, and these our sins have grown up with us
from our cradle, we being conceived and borne in sin and iniquity, and we
daily have procured thy wrath against us by neglecting thy will, and following
our own corrupt ways. So that we can find no cause in our selves to procure
thy savor, but are forced to flee out of our selves, and to betake our selves
wholly unto thy fatherly clemency. Wherefor^ (most gracious father) since in
thy heavenly wisdom, and eternal counsel, thou shall fore appointed thy son
Jesus Christ to be our only mediator, in who^ we may boldly come before thee,
and by whose death and cleansing sacrifice, it has pleased thee to satisfy
thine own justice in pardoning the sins of thy children, and turning away
thy displeasure from them, we most humbly beseech thee in ye tender bowels of
Jesus Christ, to forgive us all our sins, and bury them in the death and
obedience of thy dear son Jesus Christ, and we most h^rtily thank thee
(most loving father) for our election, creation, preser^ation, especially for
our redemption wrought by the death and bloodshedding of Jesus Christ and for
all thy abundant mercies and graces, so plentifully bestowed upon us in him
and for him. Also we beseech thee (dear father) to give us thy good spirit to
work a lively faith in us, whereby the benefit of the death and resurrection
of Christ, may be applied unto us, and become effectual in us, yt we may have
a true sight and feeling of our sins, and such a godly sorrow for them, as
may bring forth (...) repentance unto salvation not to be repented of: so
that we may mortify our sins, especially, our several sins, yt have most
prevailed against us. (...) that we may live in all holy obedience, and a new
life before thee on earth, that so we may have comfort to our consciences both
that we are thy children, and also that we shall rise to eternal life in the
resurrection of the just.

Furthermore, (O heavenly father, since thou have given us thy word to teach us
all things needful to salvation, and to instruct us in thy ways, we humbly
pray thee incline our hearts to embrace and practice the same, make us truly
thankful, for such gracious and sovereign means of our salvation, as thou
have offered us, and give us grace to use thy word, Sacraments and prayer,
reverently, and with faith and repentance, as true exercises and testimonies of
our faith, and obedience: so that we may increase in all godliness and
righteousness before thee al ye days of our life, grant these and al other thy
graces needful for us and for thy whole church, we beseech thee for Jesus
Christ his sake, in whose name we pray together with thy whole church, and for
thy church as he has taught us saying. O our Father etc.

O Lord increase our faith. Amen
