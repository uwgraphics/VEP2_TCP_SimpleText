The up cheringe of the mess: In printed at London by John Day and Willyam
Seres.

Who has not known or herd
how we were made a feared
That magre of our beard
Our mess should clean away
That we did daily say
And utterly decay
For ever and for aye
So were we^ brought in doubt
That all that are devout
Were like to go without
The mess that has no peer
Which long has tarried here
Yea many an hundredth year
And to be destitute
Of that which constitute
was of the high depute
Of Christ and his apostles
Although none of the Gospels
No mention makes or tells
We must believe what else?
Of things done by counsels.
Wherein the high professors
Apostlique successors
Take hold to be possessours
And some were made confessors
Some of them were no startars
But were made holy marters
Yet plowmen smythes and cartars
With such as be their hartars
Will enterprise to tax
These ancient men's acts
And holy fathers factes
Though mess were made by me^
As popes nine or ten
Or many more what then?
Or not of scripture grounded
Is yt therefore confounded
To be a supersticion?
Nay nay they mysse the quission
Make better Inquysicion
Ye have an evil condition
To make such exposicion
Ye think nothing but scripture
Is only clean and pure
Yes yes I you ensure
The mess shall be her better
As light as ye do set her
The scripture has nothing
Where by profit to bring
But a little preaching
With tattling and teaching
And nothing can ye epsy
Nor se with outward eye
But must your ears apply
To learning inwardlye
And who so it will follow
In goods though he may walow
If scripture once him swalowe
She will undo him holowe
Wherefore no good mes singers
Will come wtin her fyngers
But are her under styngers
For she would feign undo
All such as lives so
To the mess she is an enymye
And would distroye her utterly
Were not for sum that frendfully
In time of need will stand her by
Yet is the mess and she as like
As a christian to an heretic
The mess has holy vestures
And many gay gestures
And decked with clothe of gold
And vessels many fold
Right galaunt to behold
More then may well be told
With basen ewer and to well
And many a pretty Iwelle
With goodly candellstyckes
And many proper tryckys
With cruetts gilt, and chalys
Whereat some men have malice
With sensers and with pax
And many other knackys
With patent and with corporas
The fynest thing that ever was
Alas is it not pity
That men be no more wittye
But on the mess to Jest
Of all such thing the best
For if she were suppressed
A pyn for all the rest.
But hark to me a while
And mark ye well my style
All ye that speak so vile
And would the mess exile
Tidings I can you tell
She is like here to dwell
In dispite of the Gospel
For all his lokes so snel
And also I will prove
It will the Gospel behoue
To sue to have her love
For within few years
He durst not for his ears
Be seen in all this land
Nor hard nor had in hand
But she had by him stand
He was her servant than
Let him say what he can
With him durst no man
Meddle more or less
But when he hard mess
This must he needs confess
Or eles in exposicions
Or doctors dispuicions
Such were the constitutions
And also institucions
Such were their prohibicions
And also inhibicions
He durst not cry creake
Till he could english speak
But like an huddy peake
Keep warm his brains weak
And now he is full cranke
And conneth her no thank
But compteth her as rank
As any on the bancke
But master Euangelium
The time again may come
But well there mum
Ha, Ha, Hum.
Well yet there be some
That are not all dum
That long has hold their peace
And were content to cease
Lest malice should encrese
To fry them in their grese
And now they be turned lose
They pass not of a gose
To say the worst they can
By mess the power woman
What did I call her pore?
Nay some will call her whore
And stireth a great uproar
Some call her popes daughter
Some says she made ma^slauhgter
Some turn her to alaughte:
Some would they had not sought her
Some cursseth him yt brought her
And him that first taught her
Some say she is a leache
To make whole scabes and bleache
Some say she is good for byles
And good for hum bledheles
And good for kowe or Ox
That chafid be with yockes
And good for hens and cocks
To keep them from the fox
They say she is good for the pox
And such as have sore dockes
And as for gaulde horse backs
That chased be with packes
With panyers and with sackes
No help they say she lackes
And good for meselde hogs
And also maungye dogs
But for a Winchester goslynge
They say she passes al thing
She brings wether clear
And seasonable year
And if it neade again
They say she brings rain
She seaceth thonder loud
And carries every cloud
They say the plage and pestilence
The fever and the epilence
The popish mess expels hence
And grass she makes grow
And fair wind to blow
And rule it high and low
Her power is great I trow
And some say wedes and thorns
She keeps from the corns
And yet some mockes and scorns
And say her pristes make horns
On eueninges and in mornes
Thus do they her defame
And slander her good name
Wherein they be to blame
For I can good wittnes fet
That she never help on yet
Thus they speak and spare not
And what they prate they care not
For lowdly do they sound
That missa is not found
Within the bible book
Who so thereon shall look
And yet they be a croke
Amiss the marcke they took
There shall ye find misach
A well, how like ye this knacke?
Wherefore look about
And search in and out
For she is no lowt
I put you out of doubt
She is not clean forsaken
But very well taken
Yea yea be lakin
She is worth a flicke of baco
And if it be well sought
She will not so be bought
Yet may ye se her for naught
In many holy places
Within a few paces
An holy holy thing
Especially when they sing
With merry piping
And besy chauntyng
We may be very glade
That yet the mess is had
For all it is so bad
The people be as mad
As ever they may be
The mess to here and se
Auengaunce on it for me
For I am al most werye
I have taken such pain
To bring her home again
Wherefore now totus mu^dus
That round is and rotundus
Be merry and Jocundus
And sing the letabundus
With all the whole chorus
That here has been before us
And all the sely souls
That hereth mess in poules
And in all places beside
In london that is wide
Where mess is song or said
And be nothing affraed
That she shall go away
But tarry while she may
For she must long continue
She has such great retynue
Strong men of bone and sinue
Ye can no better wyshe
They will stick to their stochfish
And stand like lusty bloudes
Aduenturinge life and goods
And all to put in peril
For mastres missas quarrel
And nothing will they shrincke
No more then for to drink
To spoke such as they think
No no they will not wincke
At matters to be seen
Nor let for king or qnene
Ye guess nere whom I mean
Yet is it said I wene
He carried not al clean
Yet has he bolder ben
Then other fiften
Wherefore he may be praised
That such a noise is raised
And through England voysed
That he would be so hardy
Though he were taken tardy
He thought or he went thens
To declare his conscience
A man of much sapience
And full of goodly sentence
Well like to win the audience
By his copious Eloquence
If well he might enchieued
For many men believed
That he could have remeued
And won by his intent
All that there were present
Alack they were not bent
To grant or to consent
To such things as he meant
He talked that religions
With all their pretty pigions
For good intent were wroughte
God wotteth what he thought
He spoke it not for naught
Though scripture he ne brought
But if he would have sought
He could have proved it there
Or a horse could like his ear
That taking away the il
They might have stand still
And in like case by Images
And all manner of ceremonies
But tushe let go these bables
And al these fible fables
The mess he did auaunce
And highly her enhaunce
To be so such perfection
As neadeth no correction
Nor yet to have infection
For all her late detection
Nor worthy of suspection
So clear is her confection
And pureness of complexion
By catholyke election
She semes to take erection
Above the resurrection
Nor never was his lot
In her so spy a spot
But clean from blurre and blot
He loves her well, god wot
There can no droncken sot
Love more the good ale pot
I dare say at this hour
Though he be in the tower
Yet does he still honor
The mess that sweet a flower
Wherefore ye priests all That still continue shall
With messinge in the temple
Forget not this exemple
Of this your father
That ye may the rather
Obtain the grace
To come to the place
Where he does abide
And look ye do not slide
But stick to her hard
Or else all is marde
And when ye may not choose
Then must ye her refuse
There will be heavy news
As ever came to the stews
The contrye is not fair
And she likes not the air
Wherefore if she appayre
Needs home she must repair
There is no such remedy
As is her native contrie
And if she chance to dye
I can not help it I
But sing place bo
Tut let her gooe
I wene we get no mo
A good mestres missa
Shall ye go from us thissa*
Well yet I must ye kyssa
Alack for pain I pyssa
To se the moon here Issa
Because ye must depart
It greueth many an heart
That ye should from them start
But what then tushe a farte
Sins other shifte is none
But she must neades be gone
Now let us sing each one
boeth Jak and gyll and Jone
Requiem eternam
Lest penam sempiternam
For vitam supernam
And vmbram infernam
For veram lucernam
She chance to enherite
According to her merit
Pro cuius memoria
Ye may well be soria
Full small may be your gloria
When ye shall hear this storia
Then will ye cry and roria
We shall so her no moria
Et dicam vobis quare
She may no longer stare
Nor here with you regnare
But trudge ad vltra mare
And after habitare
In regno plutonico
Et E^o acronyco
Cum cetu babilonico
Et cantu diabolico
With pollers and p^iller
And al her well willers
And there to dwell ever
And thus will I leave her.
FINIS.
