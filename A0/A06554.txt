The horse* the sheep and the ghoos.
Ontreversies. plees and discordes
Bitwene persons were two or three
Sought out the grounds be records
This was the custom^ of antiquite
Iugges were fette / that had auctorite
The caas conceived stondyng indifferent
Between parties to give Judgment
Parties assembled of high and low degree
Weren amytted to shown in sentence
Grounded of their quarrels the law made hem f^^
With out excepcion to come in audience
Be the president / commanded first scilence
Fredom give / the parties not to spare
Be titell of right their greues to declare
Upon this matter shortly to conclude
Naught yore agoon as I reherce shall
I fond to purpose a symylitude
Full craftily depeynted upon a wall
Tweyne sittyng in estate royal
The fierce lion famous in all royames
And themperial egle percyng the son^e beams
These were the dredefull Iugges tweyne
In their estate syttyng I took keep
That herd the parties by and by complain
The horse the ghoos and the simple sheep
The process was not to perfounde ne deep
Of their debate but contryued of a fable
Which of hem was to man most profitable
Each for his party proudly began proceed
To force him self be record of scripture
By philosophers as clerks seen and read
The prerogatives / yeuen hem be nature
Which of these three / to every creature
In re publica / a vaileth most a man
For his party thus first the horse began The horse.
To proceed briefly and not long to tarry
First fro the truth that I do not err
What be is found in all thing so necessary
As is the horse both nyghe and far
And so notable to man in pees and werre
Horse in chronicles who so redeth a right
Have saved often many a Worthy knight
Marcyall prowess in especyall
God has be horse give to warriors
Record of alisaundre whose horse bucyfall
Made him escape fro many sharp shours
The golden chare of old conquerours
Toward the tryumphe for knyghtly deeds
Conceived hit was with four white stedes
Remember hector the trojan champion^
Whose horse was callid whilom galathe
Upon whose back he pleyde the lyon^
Full often sithes he made the greeks flee
The stead of perseus was cleped pigase
With swifte wings / poets seyn the same
Was for his swiftenes named the horse of fam^
Eques ab equo is seid of verrey right
And chyualer is said of chyualrye
In duche a rider is called a knight
Aragon tongue does also specyfye
Caualow / which in that party
Is named of worship and took beginning
Of spores of gold and chiefly of rydyng
These emperors these princes and these kings
When they ben armed in bright plate and mayle
Without horse what were their mustringes
Their broad baners or their rich apparaille
To fore her enemies to show hem in bataile
With out horse. spear. sword. ne shield
Might litell avail for to hold a field
The hardy prykars upon horse back
Be sent to forn what ground is best to take
In their ordenance that there be no lack
Be providence how they the field shall make
An horse wole weep for his master sake
Chawcer remembrith the swerd. ring and glass
Presented were upon a stead of brass
Between two hills the prophet zacharye
Saw stedes four / the first of hem was read
In chares feure the field to magnefye
And the second was black it is no dread
The third was white body neck and head
The fourth diuerce of colors / wonder strong
And to knyghthode all these a loure long
The read horse was token of hardynesse
Which apperteyneth to every manly knight
The cole black hew / a sign of soberness
Poraille oppressid to help in their right
The white milk stead that was glad of sigh^
Tokeneth that knyghthode trouly should entend
Holy church maidens and wedewie to defend
The many fold colors to speak in general
Be sundry virtues and conditions
As the four virtues called cardynall
Longyng to knyghthod tencrece their renons
In re publica / callid the champions
Truth to sustene and show hem self streng
Bound be order to se noman have wrong
With outen horse iustes ne tournaill
May not be hold in werre ne in pees
Nor in palastre no pleyes marcyall
If horse do fail may come to no^n encrees
Ne noman sothly dar put him in prees
With outen horse for short conclusion
To atteyne the palm of triumphal guerdon
Lower degrees there hen of horse also
Do great prouffit / to every comonte
The plough ne carte might naught do
With out horse / daily ye may see
Tyllyng were lost ne were we horses parde
The besy marchante to his a vantage
Ner ships and horse could have no carriage
The ship be liknesse is callid an horse of tree
Full notably who can understand
To lead men and carye them over the sea
As don horse when they come to land
The pour man eke ledeth in a band
His litell capull. his corn his mele to selle
And when hit is grou^den brings it fro ye melle
In winter season to make beal chere
The horse is nedeful wode and turf to carye
Wyn fruit and oil to serve through the year
Is beought to vyneters and to the potecarye
Diverse drugges and many a literary
Sundry bales and shortly all vitaill
Of the carriage horse have the trauaill
Heye ne otes pleinly who list learn
May fro the feldes ner the medes grene
To the garner neither to the berne
With out horse be carried hit is seen
And unto pourpose-I seye as I mean
There is no be rekene as I began
So necessary / as horse is unto man
Auguste is a season merry and glad
When every tree with new fruit is lade
With draught of horse the sheuis ben home lad
That month passid / the leeuis gyn to fade
Which made in somer a pleasant lusty shade
What don horse than to speak in words pleyn
The second croppe they carye home of ryweyn
By draught of horse fro ryuers and wellis
Bouges be brought to brewars for good ale
Led stoon tymbre caryage of bellis
We bring to chirches in troth this is no tale
We led cloth sackis and many a large male
And gladly summers be sent to forne
With gardeuyandes / how might horse be for born
Ye prudent Iuges the egle and the lion
What I have said does wisely advertise
Weyeth this matter in your discrescon
Where ghoos or sheep pleynly to deuyse
Of their nature may in any wise
Justly deem ye. late hit not be spared
Unto an horse be lykenyd and compared
That I have told is troth and no feynyng
No wight of reason again hit may apply
Ghoos ne gander ne grene gosselyng
But if they enter the bounds of envy
Late her come forth and say for her party
Ghoos yes trust me well for the I will not spare
Like as I feel my verdyte to declare
Where as thou have unto thy pasture
But oon place / to make in thy repair
Hit is granted to me by nature
To abide on water. land and eyer
Now among flowers and grenys that be feyr
Now bathe in ryuers swym^e in many a ponde
For storm or shower as dry as on the land
To myn^ entente mo things ye may seen
As men expert known that been old
When wild ghees hye in thaire up fleen
With their wings displaied and unfold
A pronostyque of snow and froste cold
Kalendes bring pleynly for to seye
Again winter how men should pourveye
The grees of ganders is good in medicyne
With sundry go^mes tempered for the gowte
Dyuerce aches to swagen and declyne
In thextremytees to draw the malice out
Feathers of ghees when they fall or mowte
To gadre hem up herdes hem delight
To selle to flecchers the graye with the white
Men pluck stalks out of my wings tweyn^
Some to portreye some to note or write
When rethoriciens have do their besy pain
Fresh epistles and lettres to endyte
With out writing a vaileth not a myte
For if pens and writing were aweye
Of remembrance than were lost the keye
Of ghees also the deed is prouid often
In many a country and many a regyon
To make pylowes and fether beds soft
Of prudence men plucken of the dou^ne
Thus to make a plain comparison
As pelows ben to chambres agreeable
So is hard straw lytter for the stable
The fyme of ghees and grene goselynges
Gadryd in may among the herbs sote
Again brennyng scaldyng and other things
Tempered with oil or butter does bote
To swage pain perceth to the rote
But horse dong as refuse is cast away
Is good for furneis tempered with claye
A deed horse is but a foul carayn
Thaire infecting / it is so coruptable
But a fat ghoos / when hit is new slain
In disshes of gold / a mussell greable
Is scruid upon a kings table
Swimming a live in watres crystalline
Tenderly roasted requires to have wyn
Through all the land of brutes albyon^
For fetherd arowes as I reherce can^
Ghoos is the best to make comparison
Except feathers of pecok and of swan^
Be bow and arowes sith the war began^
Have englishmen remembrid in storye
Of their enemies had many a victory
Horse in the field may mustre with great pride
Whan^ they of trompectis here the blody sowu^
But when an arowe has percydhis side
To ground he goth and cast his master dowu^
Entryng the field he pleyeth the lyon^
What follows after / his carayn stynketh sore
Sauf skyn^ and shone there leueth no more
Mighty captayns and knights in the field
Make their wards and their ordenance
First men of arms with polax spear and shield
Set in order dew to have the governance
Which at peyters took the king of france
Thank to the ghoos most be youen of right
Which in the field so proudly took her flight
Sloth of my flight for hasty necligence
Of presumpcion / the ghoos was left behind
When the famous and worthy due of clarence
Rode ou bayard with his eyes blind
Flight of my feathers was put out of mind
And for he set that day of me no force
So litil or naught / what a veiled him his horse
Books old remember well in sentence
Whilom when come by his soon was take
The capitole kept of with great defense
Noise of a gander / the captayn did wake
Which remembered / they set up for his sake
In their temples wide and old
A large gandre forged al of fyn gold
His w^ker noise was their sauacon^
Be which the captayn ran upon the wall
Thus be a gander recouerd was the town^
Called of the world the cite most ryall
Cite of cytees that day most principal
Was ever horse in book that ye can read
Pro re publica / that did such a deed
