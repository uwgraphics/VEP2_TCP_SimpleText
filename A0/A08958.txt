A good workman needs never want work.
If this be true, here is a parsell of ten,
All lusty able well quallified men,
That Scarce have their equals to eat, drink, and sleep
And some are fair better to hang then to keep.

To the tune of the nine maids.


YOu that good houses keeps
and would good servants hire,
With proper men to eat and sleep,
I Will furnish your desire,
My own experience has.
(In a month or little more)
Tried all that is mentioned underneath
in number half a skore,
Mark h^w they stand i^ Ra(...)e
All lusty a^le m^n,
Then you w(...) good workmen want,
come take you^ ch^yse of ten.
Come hither Tospot Tom.
thou art the first in place.
This fellow will not stay at home
above an hours space,
He^le at the alehouse stay,
from breakef^st time till dinner
From thence till supper heell be away,
by this I was a winner.
O this wa^ (...) of my men,
the chief of half a score,
All (...) good workmen then
(...) my state.
The next was Retchgutt Ralph,
right he^e to Wood of Kent,
A yeareling pigg or else a Calfe
his stomach will content,
With eight and fifty Eggs
a lenten meal heel make,
And yet he looks like one that begs,
so lean as any Rake.
O this was one of my men
the chi^fe of half a score*
You who do want good workmen then
take choice among my store.
The third was Slippery Will,
his trado he need not learn,
I had two maids and with his skill
he got them both with barn,
And two more in the town,
all in a fortnights space,
The like of him was seldom known,
He Is of a breeding race.
O this was one of my men,
the chief of half a score,
You who do want good workmen then
take choice among my store.
The fourth was desperate Dicke
heed loss his shirt at dice,
Besides he has another trick,
which he esteems no vice,
What ever he can get
by cozening or by stealing
Or running into honest men's debt,
he counts it lawful dealing.
O this was one of my men,
the chief of half a score
You who do want good workmen then,
take choice among my store.
The second part
To the same tune.


THe fifth was Sam a thresher,
the best I ere did keep
Heed work four hours every day,
and the rest heed spend in sleep.
If any did him blame,
For taking so much pains,
Heed soon make answer to the same
how can I thresh when it raynes,
O this was one of my men,
the chief of half a score,
You who do want good workmen then
take choice among my store.
The sixth was Cogging Watt
he used to lie and flatter
And Gossip-like he would prate and that,
of what it made no matter,
What ere his fellows said,
(though he ^^ou'd them in show)
The tel-tale Rascal more on t made,
And that is a good gift you know.
O this was one of my m^n,
the chief of, etc.
The seventh was Kit the Butcher
for him his sweet heart mournes.
Heed dress a Sheep or a Bullock well,
and give to his friends the horns.
Of all I ere knew in my life,
he was a pr^tty youth,
He Would with his candell l^oke his knife,
when he had it in his mouth.
O this was one of my men
the chief, etc.
The eighth was George the Grome,
a servant good and able,
Because he would not wear out his broom.
he never swept the stable.
His providence was such,
to show his honest care.
He Would never curry the horses much,
for fear they should lose their h^^^^
O this was one, etc.
The ninth to is painful Pierce,
my honest Husban^man,
All his good quallities to(...),
to more th^n now I can.
But one thing of great note,
I here (alone) will tell
Because my hemp sheule take ^^^pe (...),
he cast it in the Well,
O this, etc.
The tenth and last was N^d,
the bailiffe of my land,
Those tenants that his (...) fed,
he dealt with under hand.
For bribes and private guilts
heed let out leases cheap,
Now Judge my masters by these (...),
what benefit I might Reap.
O this was, etc.
Imagine now my friends,
you to a place are come.
Where half a score good fellows stand
within a little rome,
And all do service crave,
then do not them refuse,
To keep them I no liking have,
If I can any way choose.
O these are my br^ue m^n,
in number half a score,
You who do want good workmen then,
take choice among my store.
