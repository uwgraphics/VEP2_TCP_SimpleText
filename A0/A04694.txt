A compendyouse Sum of the very Christen relygyon: gathered faithfully out of
holy scripture: necessary for all them that read the old and new Testament.

This is my derely beloved son / for whose sake only I am apeased: him se
that ye hear and obaye.

First of all / the God.
holy Bible wryte^ Deuteronomy. vi. i. Timo. ii. Gene. xvii Exodus i. xv. Genesis. i.
Psalm. iii. Exodi. iii. Jeremi. ix. Roma. ix. i. Cori. xii. Roma. ix. Esaie.
xiv. Jere. xviii.
techeth us / yt there is but one God almighty / for all alone sufficyent /
having nether beginning nor ending / which of his own mercyable goodness
with his word created all things / of whom all things proceed / without
whom there is no thing / he is just and merciful / it is he that works all
things in every thing according unto his godly will: unto who^ it is not
laufull to say / wherefore doist thou thus or thus?

Furthermore / The cre^cion of ^an.
it is to be known and constantly to be believed / Genesis. i.
this same our God almighty to have had created Adam the first man according
unto the image and symylitude conceived in his mind / and to have had
constytute him the lord over all the creatures in the earth. Sapien. ii Roma. v.
The which Adam through the envy of the devil / Synue
dysobaying the precept of his maker / became first of all men sinner / and
brought in sin into this world / yea and such one and so greuouse a sin /
that we all / which have been brought forth and begote^ of him after the flesh
/ be subjects and bond men to sin / to death and damnacyo^ / redacte and
captyued eue^ under the tyra^nouse yoke of the devil. Ephesi. ii.


It is also to be perfitly known and steadfastly to be believed / that of God
the father / our savior Jesus Christ his son was promised unto ye said
Adam / unto Abraham Isaac / Jacob / Dauyd / and unto the other fathers to
deliver them from sin and from the tyranny of the devil / and not only them
but us also / and as many as like the^ with a perfayte and lively faith trust
and cleave unto this promise and unto this same Jesu Christ / which hope and
believe to obtain this delyueraunce / is of him and through him only. Christ was
promised unto us.
This promise is often times repeted Genesis. iii xii. xxvi. v xxviii
and reherced in the books of Habre. ii.
the old Testament: ye and eue^ that same old Testament is the very self
covenant and promis: The old and new Testament.
none otherwise then this called the new testament techeth us y^ same promys
now to be fulfilled.

But yet while this health and deliuerau^ce then promised was waited and looked
for of the fathers / the law
the law whereby sin might be known was given. For verily / such is the
nature and dysposycyon of man that not only he cannot / but also he will not
acknowledge and confess him self to be a sinner / and namely that same sinner
which has need of this so holy and holsom a promise. Exo. xi^. ^^^ Romans iii.
v.
The law therefore was given of God whereby men might know what thing sin is:
ye and that the^ selves to be very sinners: seeing them selves with glad and
ready will / which God requires to do nothing that the law commands / but
rather with an evil will without love / but constrained there unto by fere of
hell and pain which the law threteneth / saying: Deu. xxvii
Cursed be he that is not permane^t whole and fast cleuyng unto the
commandments of the law to perform the^ in very deed. Galat. iii.
This law therefore (I say) was given / that thereby sin and the malice of
man's heart once known / me^ should the more ferue^tly thyrste for the coming
of Christ / which should redeem them from their sins: as it was fygured unto
the Jews by diverse ceremonies / oblacyons / and sacrifyces prescribed and set
forth of God before their eyes: not that these things should take away their
sins / but that they should admonysshe and teache them to be taken away in time
to come by faith / Hebr. ^
and by that saving health promised in Christ: which ceremonies / oblacyons. etc.
are now abolysshed and gone by the coming of Christ / Mat. xvii. Joan. i*
which is ye very sacrifyce and oblacyo^ only yt apeaced the fathers wrath and
took away all sin.

At the last / Christ our savior is come.
we are taught by the books of the new Testament which are the second part of
the Bible: Luce. ii. Galat. iiii. Ephesy. i. Roman. v* Tit^. iii. Ephesi. ii.
Roma. v.
that Christ then promised and figured in y^ old Testament was sent us of the
father at the time determined and appointed with him self / Joan. i. Esai.
liii. i. Joan. ii. ii. Petri. ^i. Luc. i. Hebreo. ii.
that is to wete eue^ when all iniquyte and sin most abou^ded and flowed over
all. He was not sent for that any man by his own good dedys had deserved his
coming (for all were sinners) but because he being so true of his promise
would give us the plentuouse riches of his grace and favor which he had
promised us. In ye new testament therefore it is plainly entreted and wryte^ /
that Jesus Christ the very lamb verily offered up is come / The la^b sacrifyed
up for us.
to reconcyle us unto our father / paying upon the cross ye pains dew for
our sins / to deliver us out of the bondage of the devil (who^ we served in
sin) and to get us to be the chyldern of God / Our peace
geuyng us the very peace and tra^quyllyte of mind / Roma. v. Joa^. iii. vi.
that hence forth we fere no more hell / which fere is put away by faith /
Faith.
confyde^ce / and ferme adsured trust which out father gives unto us
allewryng and drawyng us unto his son. For faith is the gift of God / whereby
we believe Christ to have had comen in to this world to save the sinners / i.
Timot. i. i. Joan. iii.
which faith is of such power and of so great effycacy yt who so have it / they
will cover and desire to do and perform according to ye ensample of Christ all
the offices and dedys of charity. ii. Cori. i. ^
For faith once received / God gives his holy spirit / The holy ghost.
by whom he co^seygneth and marketh all that believe / which spirit is the
pledge and (as ye would say) the ernest penny certifying us to possede that life
eternal / ye and he testifyeth unto our heart and spirit / graffyng there into
such a faith that we are sure and certyfyed that we be the chyldern of God /
ye spirit powrynge therewith into our inward man yt same charity Charity
and love which Paul descrybeth and sets forth unto the Corynthia^s. i.
Cori. xiii.
For this faythis sake and confydence in Christ / which is effectuouse by
charity / showing herself clearly in y^ wor^^s of love / excytyng and mouyng
man unto them. For this same faith es sake (I say) are we iustyfyed: that is
to say / the father of Christ (which also is become out father through Christ
our brother) rekeneth us for ryghtuouse and for his own chyldern of his own
mere mercy and graciouse favor not imputyng unto us our sins. Justificacyo^
or ryghtwysmakynge.
Hebreo. ^
ii. Corin. v


And to conclude with few words ye shall know that Christ is now come to
thentent yt we through him pourged and puryfyed from our sins / that is to
say consecrated into the use of the father to serve him in good works the
works of our flesh utterly Tit. i
renounced / might serve Good works our sanctificacyon
him freely in ryghtwysnes and holiness all our life long by good works / which
God has prepared that we should walk in the^ / declaryng our selves certainly
to be called unto this favor / which works who so have the^ not he shows
him self to have no faith in Christ. (...)
Ephe. ^^^


Unto whom we must drawenye / and with a glad mind follow him: Math. x^^^^.
xxiii.
Christ (...) our master.
that he might teache us / for he is our master both myld and homble in heart.
Joan. xviii
Ephesians. v
(...)
It is he that is our ensample / of who^ we ought to learn the form and rule
to live well. i. Petri. ii.
Hebr. iiii.
(...)
He is also our highest priest and bishop / that is to say our herdman /
dilygently waytyng and lokyng upon us / vysytyng us to fed^ faithfully and
louyngly with his word / he is our only medyatour / which now sits at ye
right hand of God ye father / praying incessauntly for us / which doutelesse
will obtain what so ever we ask of the father by him or in his name / so
long as we thus asking believe that he will grant it us / for so has he
promised. (...)
Medyatour alone.
Hebr. xii.
i. Joan. ii.
Roma. vi.
Joan. xiiii.
Hebr. iiii. Joa^. xiiii. v Mat. xxi. c. Mar. xi. c.
Let us not therefore doubt / all be it at any time we be sinners / to step
forth and come nyghe unto him with confidence and trust with a lively and
constant faith and believe to obtain mercy and grace. i. Timot. i.
For doubtless therefore is he come / even to save sinners / nether does he ask
any thing else of us / tha^ that we should boldly go unto him. Mat. x^^
The judgment


This same verily is christ Jesus / which after that he has with the breath
of his mouth slain y^ sinful man / he shall sit into his gloryouse majesty
to judge all men / and to reward every man according as he has here lived in
his own body / whether it be good or evil / sayi^g unto them that shall
stand at his right hand: ii. These. ii.
ii. Corin. v
Mat. xxv.
Life everlasting.
Come ye blessed children of my father and possede you this kingdom prepared
for you from the beginning of the world. But unto the^ which shall be at his
left hand / shall he say: avoid fro me ye cursed / and go into yt fire
everlasting which is prepared for the devil and his angels. Then shall
there be an end of this world / and he shall deliver the kingdom unto God the
father / (the kingdom is here taken for the hole number of the elect) i. Corin.
xv


To thentente we might know this thing / the holy scripture in the Bible / by
the goodness of God through his holy spirit is left and given us: ii. Petri. i.
yt we might know / I say / and believe / that there is but one God for all
alone suffycyent / and Jesus Christ who^ he has sent us: Joan. xvi^ and. xx.
so that we thus beleuynge might have in the name and for the glory of him
life everlasting.

Besydys this ground and foundation of all Christen relygyon / i. Corin. ii^.
there may noman lay any other: ye and saint Paul desires him to be accursed
and separated from God that will preche any other faith and salvation then
through Jesus Christ only: Galat. i.
all be it he were an angel out of heaven.

For of him / and by him / and in him are all things: Roma. ii.
unto who^ with the father and holy ghost be honor and glory for ever and
ever. Amen.

Come unto me all you yt labor and are oppressed with the heavy burden of sin
/ and I shall ease and refreshe you. Matthew. xi.
