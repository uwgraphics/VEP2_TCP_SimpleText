TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, NOBLE, AND MOST WORTHY LORD, THOMAS LORD BVRGH, BARON
GAINS BVRGHE, LORD GOVERNOR FOR HER MAJESTY OF HER TOWN OF BREILL, AND THE
FORTS OF CLAYBVRGH AND MEWENNOORT IN THE COVNTIE OF HOLLAND IN THE LOW
COVNTRYES, KNIGHT OF THE MOST HONORABLE ORDER OF THE GARTIER, LORD DEPVTY AND
GOVERNOR GENERAL FOR HER MAJESTY OF HER REALM OF IRELAND.
RIght honorable and thrice noble Lord: (the sole true patron of all virtue and
my poor deseruings)
I have long wrastled in the labor of my best wits, to betoken to your L. self
as the choice of a world, some acceptable pledge or testimonial
acknowledgement of my love, duty and thankefulnes: which in the b^st
allowaunce from my weak fortunes I can in no sort better appoint then by this
my silly Citharn School. For as among other your many graceful virtues I know
your L. lives iudicially accompanied with a love to Music irremoueable, both
art and nature tying you thereunto in a bond of great right by your own most
excellent managing of all kinds of Instruments gentile, so am I most assured
that this little Wanton has not the least, but a prime place in the
commanding performance of your pleasures: wherein as well others as my self
which hold it in profession, are bound even in a general assent to humble our
best doings to your honorable and learned fingers. By which reason alone were
there none other (under your L. good favor I speak it) this slender work of
mine may as in a law full birthright challenge the inheritance of protection
from you. Howbeit, neither arrogantly nor too presumptuously do I dare to
present it unto you, but dutifully, reverently, and in every good sort best
becoming me, as an open badge by which the world shall not deny, but know me
to be yours. Most humbly therefore beseeching your L. good acceptance hereof,
and in the continuance of your honorable favors, to hold of me as the man
that has ever lived in a religious desire to do you all honor and service, I
take my leave.

Your L. ever most faithfully devoted ANTONY HOLBORNE.

Ni merear moriar.
To the proficient Scholar or lover of the Cittharn.
FAr be it from me (gentle friend) in the humor of vaineglorie to recommend
these my silly labors to the press, and by the press to thee, under a
further hope of thy better censure then of their little-worth: for hitherto
could I never stand so well conceipted of my self in selfe-opinion, nor by
persuasion of others, to enworthy them of thee in this public form. But the
time now presenting occasion by a wrong proffered from a mere stranger unto
me, who (without my knowledge of either man or mean) has delivered in common
to the worlds view certiane corrupt coppies of my Idles, (the untimely fruits
of my youth, begotten in the cradle and infancy of my slender skill) I am
therefore with a more easy reason led to call home mine own mangled children to
the original place of their nativity: both in respect of their immaturitie,
and the disguised countenance wherein they live abroad. And to purchase thy
better conceit, with a more pleasing relish to thy chaste ears then their
bastard barbarism since their first escape from me could promise, I have
endeavored my self in a careful reuisitation, to regenerate and newly replant
them, by purging them of those unsavory corruptions, which I know could not
choose but give offense to thee as well as to my self. Such therefore as they
now are, with a liberal consent I do freely commend them to thy hands and
good usage, as the true images of their father; whom I have appointed to
attend thee in all their best services. And in their deseruings if they have
any, give them leave I pray thee, (as well for their duty toward me as their
willingness to serve thee) meekely in my name to crave but good acceptance.
Thou shall find them of several natures and offices: which I have accordingly
marshalled in such method and form, as to my judgment may best beseem thee
in degrees of thine ability to entertain them. For in the front of the book
(as the first step or key to open a way to thy beginnings) I have prefixed some
few tastes, which by another name I call Praeludia: things short and not hard:
delivered unto thee of purpose to guide thy hand to some proper use of play,
and withal to search and feel if thy Cytharn be well in tune: things very
well also becoming any man as a preface before he shall proceed to do any
determinate matter. Next unto them as in an orderly consequence I have
conjoined the most usual and familiar grounds of these our times, for consort
or thine own private self: together with some such other light fancies of
vulgar tunes for variety as I could best call to memory: wherein happily some
men in the condition of their own nature may hold themselves better pleased
then in things of more worth. All which I have laid down with as much
facility and ease for a scholars encouragement as my poor wits could
fashion, observing such formality as may well stand with a tolerable allowance
in the nature of the Instrument. To these as thy increase of performance
rises, have I annexed some of the same grounds in variable division: done
after a more quick and hard manner of play: thereby to teach thee the nearest
course to shift thy hand from string to string. Lastly, (as a complet summary
of this little work) I conclude with things grave and more judicious then the
rest with their Bases in prickesong notes, which I have set down on every Page
opposite to the same lesson. These things being of another stamp, do carry
their natural parts tied together in a different nature, with some reasonable
good cords and bindinges after a more heedfull manner of composition, which in
the first object to thine eye and finger by a superficial passage, may amate
and withhould thy forwardness, because they will appear more severe and
painful then do lie in common custom. Howbeit I wish thee not to desist, but
rather advance thy best conceiptes with a resolution, for I have prepared
nothing which has not been, is not, and may be commanded by the hand: for
all are comprehended within the limits of hand-reach. And therefore (good
friend if thou do respectively perform them in a true observation and orderly
rule of play, they shall leave in thee a better impression of their worth then
the other first sorts, and feed thee (no doubt) with a pleasing humor of
passion and sweet melancholy. Mine they were once, now are they ever thine,
begotten, bred, and borne to do thee service. Use them therefore: and m^, (if
thou please) as but in common courtesy I hope thou will. And if the liberty of
hereafter-times shall occasion me in this kind to enlarge my further pains, I
will send some others of my children in the quest of their brethren: which
proouing better scholars shall also teach thee to handle six strings, where
now thou have but four. In the mean time I wish to please thee, and thee to
please thy self in a liberal saciety if it be here. And if happily (even in
a narrow search) thou do but meet with any one digestive portion of contentment
from among these my little ones, I shall hold my self bound in
euer-redoubling thanks for thy favorable acceptance, and rest thine in all
love, and my best means to pleasure thee.
