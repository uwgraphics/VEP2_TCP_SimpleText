The desperate Damsells Tragedy. OR The faithless young man.
To the tune of Dulcina.
IN the gallant month of June,
When sweet roses are in prime,
And each bird with a several tune,
Harmoniously salutes the time:
then to delight,
my appetite
I walked into a meddow fair,
and in a sh^de
I spyed a maid
Whose love had brought her to despair.
She her hands sat sadly wringing
Making piteous exclamation,
Upon a false Young man for bringing
Her into this great vexation:
Quoth she false youth,
Is there no truth,
In thee, of Faith have thou no share?
no thou have none,
it is to well known:
By me poor wretch now in despair
How oftentimes have thou protested
That thou love me well indeed?
And I performed what was requested,
Tw^ much trust my woe does breed:
I let thee have
what thou did crave,
^educed by thy speeches fair,
and having had,
thy will false lad,
At last thou left'st me in despair.
My dearest Jewel thou have taken,
Which should stand me in great stead,
And now thou have me quite forsaken,
And art like false Aeneas fled,
from Dido ^^ue:
what can ensue,
This faithles deed ^ but to end my care,
like her a knife,
must end my life
For I like her am in despair.
Then since it is so, come gentle death,
I yield my self unto thy power.
Most willing to resign my breath,
I am this instant time and hour:
let thy keen dart,
such force impart
That I may die, o^ do not spare,
from earth I came,
and willing a^,
Hence to return with grim despair:
When she these bitter words had spoken
From her mind so fraught with woe,
Her heart was in her bosom broken
Tears abundantly did flow,
from her fair eyes,
then to the skies,
She did direct her hands with prayer,
and seemed to move,
the powers above,
To scourge the cause of her despair.
The second part, To the same tune.
YOu Gods (quoth she) I invoke,
That as your judgments still are just,
My wrongs I pray you vindicate,
Oh may no Maid that young man trust:
henceforth may he
so wretched be,
That none for him at all shall care,
but that he may
for his foul play,
Be brought like me to grim despair.
Having made an end of praying,
Suddenly she drew a knife,
And I that near unseen was staying,
Ran in have to save her life,
but ere that I
to her could cry,
That her o^ne life she might forbear,
she Dido-like
her heart did strike,
Thus did the Damsel in despair.
With such force her self she stabbed,
Blood ran out abundantly,
My heart within my bosom throbbed,
To behold this Tragedy;
Yet though she bled,
she was scarce dead,
But gasping lay with her last air,
and unto me
she spoke words three,
Which showed the cause of her despair.
Sir (quoth she) muse not to see me
Desperately my self to slay,
For his fatal stroke does free me
From disgrace another way:
My honors dead,
my credits fledd,
Why therefore should I live in care:
this being spoke,
her heart strings broke,
Thus dyed the Damsel in despair.
When death had done his worst unto her,
I did wishly on her look,
And by her favor I did know her.
Therefore I my Journey took
Unto the Town,
where she was known,
And to her friends I did declare
what dismal fate
had hapt of late,
Unto this Damsel in despair.
With brinish tears her friends lamented,
To hear of her timelesse end,
And every one in grief consented,
And with me along did w^nd
Unto the place
where lay that face,
That late alive was fresh and fair,
now wanne and pale
cause life did fail,
Her life she ended in despair.
When this was told to her false Lover,
He was of his wits bestraught,
And wildly ran the Country over,
Home he would by no means be brought:
Let this Tale then
warn all young men,
Unconstancy still to forbear,
For he betraide
this harmless Maid
Unto her death through grim despair,
