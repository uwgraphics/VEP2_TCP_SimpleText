To the right Honorable, Sir Henry Compton knight, Lord Compton of Compton

AS Moses once by law then made
Was taught to swim and not to wade
Arrived (by God) at Princes place,
Whom Pharaos daughter took to grace.
And brought him up, and taught him so,
Who proved at length as well ye know:
So I by channce this Pamphlet here
Did save sometime from water clear,
And took it up and brought to light,
To be defended through your might.
And so your Honors favor find,
According to the Authors mind.
Four year and more I did him nurse.
Although no whit it cost my purse,
Yet driven at length at cost to be,
Because your Lordship should it see,
Yet no such cost as shall appear,
But mende my purse within the year.
Th'aucthor sure I do not know,
N^whet^er he be high or low,
Or now alive, or else be dead:
But this in few words may be sead.
Hoping your honor accept it will,
According to the Authors skill.
And for my part still shall I pray,
That God your Lorship bliss always.
R. Smith.

The Authors Epistle.
WHen I had compiled (right honorable) this little treatise, and barbarous
Manuel, containing the History of Pelops and Hyppodamia, with sundry Songs
and Sonets, (being none other in deed then such as at leisurable times happened
to my mind, and not of purpose invented) I stood in doubt whether I were
better presume to publish this my trauail, or in covert wise to keep it close.
At length I assured my self although it would bring but little pleasure to the
Readers if it were published, yet l^sse would it be to any man if I kept it
close. To this end, to this point and issue I resolved my self for a season,
and minded in deed to bring it to light But the while (as it were by a vision)
another doubt and new disturbance happened to my mind, that for so much as by
often reading and perusing of the same, I found my doings to be but rude, yea
and as it were almost in vain, I was in doubt I say, (right Honorable)
weighing and considering these enormities, whether to set abroach this my new
wine, being but of ill color, and worse ^ast, upon mine own head, or mine
own aduen ture: seeing so many serpents tongues ready in the way, and the
teeth of so many barking dogs ready to bite: on the one side com meth Zoylus
or Theogninus, and bring with them a railing rout of Sycophanticall brablers:
then thought I best on the other side to arm my self against these my
mischievous enemies with the title of some honorable, that might defend me from
all such slaunde rous assaults. And seeing that you by just defcent and noble
parentage, are such a one as against whom I know for certainty by right such
men cannot be by envy moved, I am so bold as under your shield to publishe
this my work. Therefore these two things I crave of your honor, which both I
trust of so gentle heart as heth within your breast shall not be denied. The one
is this, that for so much as more boldly then advisedly I enterprise under
your name to show the skyll of my tender quill (being so small) I here desire
your Lordeship to pardon my rash doings. And the other is this: for so much as
this simple volume is given you of a mere good will, I desire you to accept it
as a token and none otherwise then it is in deed. To be praised or extolled
above the merits of the same, I do not desire. My pains herein taken I would
not esteem, so that I might obtain the benevolence of the readers: yet if it
happen so that of the better sort I stand well liked of, let Momus moppe and
mow, til I bid him stay. Thus trusting that this simple token you will not
despise, I end, unwilling any further to molest you, yet the while beseeching
God to preserve you in Galens health: and in time to endue your Lordshippe with
Nestors years, and Xerxes wealth.

() Your Lordships to command to his power, Matthew Grove.

The argument of the History following.
ONomaus was king of Archandia, unto whom it was told by the Southsayers, that
whonsosuer his only daughter Hipodamia did marie, he should dye, she coming
to her ripened years, he proclaimed a prize of running with Charwis, that
whosoever did vanquish him therein, should marry Hippodamia, and have the Realm
with her, but the vanquished should dye. Many of the Woers were slain: at last
Pelops promised privily to Myrtilus that if he should win the prize,
Myrtilus should lie with Hipodamia the first night to Whereupon he made the
Axiltree of wax, by reason whereof in the course the Charet fell down, which
Onomaus the^ per ceyuing, slew himself, and Pelops enjoyed the Lady, and
Myrtilus requyring that which was promised, Pelops threw him into the Sea,
which ever after was called mare Myrtonum.

The most famous and tragical history of Pelops and Hippodamia.
THere stretches long a Realm in Greece,
of antique brute and fame,
Whose memory remains yet,
Archadia it we name.
Which title Archas son of Jove,
bestowed on that land:
Who ruled there with Regal crown,
and golden mace in hand.
There is the fenne of Lernea,
where Hidra monster great
With hundred hissing Serpents heads,
retained there her seat.
Til Hercules enforced was
with strength the fiend to gripe,
And Erymanthus river there,
his surging course does keep.
Where once the scepter help in throne
Omaus with his might,
One of the sons of dreadful Mars,
the furyous God of fight:
Which wight of Parge sisters three,
such grace he began obtain,
That they did all forbear to cut
or shred his threan in twain.
Whereby he drew his vital web,
until the silver hears
Began grow upon his aged skull,
for cause of many years.
He only Hippodame had,
his daughter damsel fair.
Which by descent and due desert,
should stay his lawful heir.
Who guyded was in seemly life,
by learned Sages store.
And as she does increase her days,
so virtues has she more.
She was her fathers only joy,
the fortress of his life
She left was only of his stock
then sole without a wife.
In so much that the greatest care
and study of the king,
Was aye in virtues lore to train
and this his daughter bring.
Which virtues she conceived so,
and printed in her heart,
As fast as learned Patrons could
instruct her them by art.
Which caused her in flaming years,
to bear the worthy fame:
And ne to have among the rest,
her mate, a courely dame.
But that she did excel and shade
the shape of every wight
As much as Luna with her horns
surpast a star by light.
These virtues and the like so rare
enforst the father old
With zealous care his daghter and
her state for to behold,
And to provide that damage small
hereafter should annoy
The tender corpse by any means
of this his only joy.
For which intent he did retain
with him in Court always
A number seen in Magike art
and prone for such assayes:
Which by their learned skill forshew
unto the king and his
Those things that long shall after fall
of evil hap or bliss.
Which men Omaus king began will
in presence for to come,
Which do approach, their duty eke
with bended knee soon down,
Do listen then to hear their charge:
to whom the king began say.
My tried friends, ye learded peers,
in whom my trust does stay,
As heretofore ye faithful have
been unto me and mine,
In all aspects and great affairs,
so now your ears incline:
You all do know our daughter dear,
our Hippodame mild,
Who seems now in youthly years,
a most virtuous child,
And shunneth yet each sinful lore,
as far as I can know,
Whereby to me no little joy,
through her I say does grow:
Yet doubting now dame Fortunes wheel,
which whirieth very strange,
I ask your aid, for to prevent
and stop a sodeyne change.
For Fortune frail not surely stays
her steps still in one place,
But turns as the wind, whereby
I stay in doubtful case.
What if that she should be infect
with Venus wanton sport,
Or other like: or if that she
should any ill report,
That may vnwished come to pass?
I silie wight in woe,
Might wail the case of this my child,
her self which noyeth so:
For youth is frail, and tends not
sometimes to sage advise,
And shunneth that which they perceive
Those men which do seem wise,
For to embrace: for they whom that
old Senex staff has smite,
In sadness, not in youthly pranks
do study and delight.
But youth does tread the path to sin^
and erst t'obtaine that still,
Which they perceive does please the flesh,
hap either good or ill.
And you do know, there nothing is
that frail flesh pleases more,
Than that which does depend on vice,
wereof there reigns store.
And I remember Venus son
who with his shaft and bow
Does often peerce the hearts of those
who like pangues did ne know
Alas if that should light on her,
as likely sure it is,
Unawares to me then might I say
adue my joy and bliss.
For that blind boy does cast his dart,
not on the meanest fort,
As soon as on those stately Peers,
that places have in Court.
For why they drive their time in ease
and idly spend the day
They feed on dayntie dishes race
and rest on down for aye,
There is no pleasure but they taste
as may content the heart
Which are the causes that he does
so soon throw them his dart.
For if thou banish idleness,
thou breakest then the bands
Which Cupid does with flight devise
to tangle both thy hands
If she should chance to fix her mind
in love with one that is
Inferior in degree to her
which match were far amiss,
I should be loath, therefore my friends
of this her destiny,
I will that ye ensearch forthwith,
and it reveal to me,
To this intent I may provide,
for to prevent the same,
If it should happen for to be
impayring to her fame.
Yet willingly I would that she
should join with one in love
As meet is in degree, which does
from him all vice remove,
For this I know the time will be
if that her years endure,
Needs she must knit her self to one
in wedlock joy most pure.
Wherefore repair to th'used place
and with our Gods assent
As touching Hippodamia,
to know their high intent.
And take the fairest goat that may
within this town be found
Him offer up in sacrifice,
to them, whose laud does sound
Above the stars, who rule the globe
who sit above the starry sky,
And know such things as erst were pa(...),
and those to come perdy.
Then they all on their bowed knees,
unto the earth doe-fall
And one of them does answer then
and thus in name of all,
O king, if that we would not grant
now to thy hest and thee,
Unworthy we were of our (...),
true subjects ne were we.
If that by Magike are we may
satisfy thee in this,
We are right glad that by the same
we thee asferre such bliss.
And now there does remain no more
but th'while to love I pray,
To further that our enterprise,
which fortune does assay.
This Onomaus king was of
and held the Pain(...) law,
He kn^w not then the huing God
ne kept himself in awe:
Wherefore he began(...) a place
as best he had in thought,
Where he and erst his subjects more,
to feigned Gods they sought.
Herein were aulters many store.
where when in smart they fall,
They offer up their Sacrifice,
and to their Gods they call.
The cause is say they (for why)
they offer up such gift
And offerings brent for Sacrifice
is for a proper shift,
For this they thought, since that so far
of distance were the skies,
Their voice might scarce be heard, or else
so high as skies arise,
Yet often they do prayers houle
unto their gods above:
To this intent when loud they cry,
they might by chance have love:
And eke on aulters them to move
with burned flesh intend,
The smoke whereof in little while
might unto them ascend.
And thus although no voice might be
so high as skies inclinde.
Yet by the incense thereof, they
might understand their mind:
For smoke (they say) goes upward still,
and rises with the wind.
These wisemen to the temple go,
with have for to fulfill
The hest of Onomaus king,
and search for good and ill.
They bring with them the kyd his death
which rests to receive,
And one of them with p(...)recing knife
does force him life to leave.
And wringing out the blood also,
depriving him his skyn,
They prayers say, which they suppose
does cause the Gods to blinne.
Then kindle they the fire, and throw
the Goat into the same.
For to consume to ashes aye
by violence of flame.
They mark the diverse colors that
in waste do flee therehence,
The raynbow hue, to deem thereby
of Gods the high pretense.
Some on Saturnus call, and some
on Jupiter do cry,
Some on Mars, and some on Sol.
yea some on Mercury,
Some on Venus, some to Luna
make their vocation.
No god there was but him they had,
in appellation.
As diversely their minds were set,
so diversely they call
Each one unto his god to prove
which happyest would befall
So they consume the time until
the flesh is almost spente,
Then deem they what shall happen, as
they think is Jove's intent,
And other gods: then pray they one
which oldest was of all,
To show them first what he did think
should afterward befall.
But he with pause does stay, as though
some doubt he did perceive,
His rolling eyes cast up,
and musing he does leave
And said: my friends and fellows dear
shall I now tell in deed,
This case, or as I think thereof?
the more haste the worste speed.
I well perceive by th'azure hue,
that painted aye the flambe,
And by the string that held the heart
of this our killed lamb,
With other signs but evil news,
for us aye to declare,
It certain is when Hippodame
in marriage link does fare,
Our king must l^se his life perforce
whether he will or no,
Such froward destiny for him
the Gods have grant to shoe.
And was not aye the very like
reveled to you all,
Alas, this cruel sudden chance
my mind does much appall.
How say my friends? but now such fear
has strike them to the heart,
That they have now scarsce power to speak
or him thereof impart.
At length they causoe him understand
that they did know full well
The same, but that they gave to him
the pre-eminence to tell
And first declare the same, for he,
was oldest them among,
For reverence ouht be given
to the old men, of the young:
They all devise the mean whereby
they may this express
Unto Omaus, which does expect
an answer more or less:
And then that aged father does
his tale again renew,
Full bent to wail their own state,
as after does ensue.
Alas what hay had we (quoth he)
this art for to assay,
Why d^d not we bestow our minds
or wits another way?
I muse wherefore each wight with tongue
does this our dark estate
Most happy call, when us they mind
and when of us they prate,
And blabbe that we each thing do know
and ken each destiny,
And eke the knots of fortunes laund
can undo by and by.
Alas if that we tell a man
his present froward fate,
Then are we sure of him to have
and purchase peevish hate.
And although his desire be
to know the very same,
Yet nay thelesse if it be sharp
he gives us the blame,
Again, or else if we conceal,
and do not tell the truth
Then are we sure and certain that
the wrath of God ensues.
Thus on each side the doubt is plain
the peril is more great,
We are in worse case then they whom
the destintes do threat.
As now when that we do foretell
this hap unto the king,
Who knows what he in raging fits
will do, or else what thing
With mischief shall be done by him,
perhaps in that his ire,
He will pretend to slay us than
to quench his burning fire.
As though that we were cause thereof
our selves this do we know
Nor cannot aye unless we should
more sacrifices show
To deem thereby our froward fate
but now the time does haste
That we must wend unto our king,
and spend no wind in wast.
I would to Jove that we might stay,
until to morrow day,
And then to yield our answer up
the while we would assay
By incence sweet the destiny
that happen should to us.
Then each doubt and each fearful poyat
we would our selves discuss,
But now there is no remedy,
Omaus king does stay
Ere this time long in closet tilte
to hear what we can say.
He thinks it long til that we come
to tell to him this spite,
Come let us go, the gods us shield,
and succor with their might.
Thus pass they on their way until
unto the hall they come,
From thence they pass the chambers large,
and go through many a room,
Until the privy chamber they,
approach, wherein the king
Remained then, whom they salute
as best with their liking.
Then how they down their knees to the earth,
then one of them began say
O sovereign king our liege and Lord
thus much we do thee pray,
Since thou do will that we reveal
such things we know to thee,
To pardon us, what ever that
of us shall spoken be.
That being grant, we boldly then
our minds may whole express
And open thee each darkened point,
as thou erst would no less,
Which he began grant thus much, and says
some perverse news I feel,
Because ye doubt mine ire, alas
I dread dame Fortunes wheel.
Perdy I think if that my chance
were happy me to save
There were (...) ne^de that pardon thus,
of me you you should (...).
Oh tell the same, then they again
the Gods that rule the sky,
And turn the rounded globe, whose power
and whose authority
Thou may ne gaynsay once,
to us thus they declare,
That when thy daughter Hipodame
in wedlock bands does fare
(Which now in ripened years does wax)
that thou shall lose thy lise,
The very day most sure ^r which
see given stares a wif^.
Thus much we ^^a^ued have, thus much
the perverse dest^ y
Of thee for her by offerings brent,
we know assuredly
Provide therefore, it happen shall,
as sure as Jove does reign
As true as son of Mars thou art
in skies which did remain
^^en he as foming bore that whets
his tuskes against the fight,
oath rage with pusfed face, and erst
with swelling eyes for spite.
His ire permits his tongue to tell
the grief he bides with pain.
So vanquishe he with fury was,
in dumpe does so remain,
At length when memory he found
his sparkling eyes at last.
Vpthrowen, this tale with warbling tongue
among them be outcast,
Oh Jove what cruel hap is this,
what deuilish desteny,
What horror does invade my breast?
because that I must dye.
And must I die in deed for that
as yet I never knew
I never knew my face before
what after should ensue
Oh fortune, fortune, which no treades
her steps still in one place,
But wavering here and there most frail,
as doutfully does trace
Why deals not she as equally
the golden gifts she has,
But sets some to top on high
and some treades underneath.
Oh Hippodame is this the gift
and recompense I have
Because that I thee traynes thus
in Courtly place so brave*
Is this the fruits I reap of thee,
who in thy childish years
Did show come thy sire such hope,
and sprang me silver hears:
Alas, alas, that thou should be
the causer of my grief,
Which want the only joy to me
and fortress of my life.
The staff whereby I teaned, when
I fell in any smart,
As often as I thought on thee,
full light was then my heart
Oh A^sculap revive my corpse
that passes now to woe,
Come Cl^o help my parched pains
and haples hap to show.
There was not since the world began
a wight that felt such grief
As now I feel, or had such cause
to wayle his noyed life.
Can there be any greater pain
or torment can you tell,
Bethought by furious fiery friends,
that lurk below in hell,
I read that Ixion is tuxned
there, and tossed on hie,
For promise broke, or whirling wheel.
so for desert perdy,
Sisiphus does on shoulders bear
the stone to top of hyl,
Which rolling down again, he does
renew his paynfull ill.
Amyd the lake with thirsty jaws
old Tantalus therein
Pursues the waves the water stream
does wet and wash his chinne.
And when to him now often deceived
it does yet promise make
Then flits the flood the fruit at mouth,
his famine does forsake.
I read also how Titius heart,
to flying foul is pray,
And Danaus daughters fill in vain
their watery vessels aye.
And all these feel such pangues and pains
for some their just desert
But I as giltles now abide,
it for to peerce my heart.
If for desert I felt the same
less grief it were to me
But once being come t'expulse the same,
I find no remedy.
Thus finishe he his wayling style
commanded erst with speed
The Southsayers for to avoid,
which willingly for dread
Consent, misdoubting much that he
in fury fond some fact
To them would do, whereby their greese,
they should for naught exact.
Omaus then be takes hunselfe,
and goes in covert wise,
To garden plot, where by him self,
he wayles with watty eyes,
There doubts he what were best to do,
what remedy to find
What wile for to coin out that might
deceive fortune unkind.
At last he thinks to slay and did
his daughter of her life,
For so much as she was the spring
wherehence does flow his grief
And better it to be that she
in Charons boat should w^^d
Then he, who being dead(...)
his destiny to end.
For since that Jove appointed has,
this destiny to take,
Effect when ever that she did
her sole estate forsake.
If she were (...)ne before that time
by no means he can see,
Through her desert this hap to pas
then no such hap to be.
And so himself quyt for to leave
then stays be a while,
At last he does revoke those words
and them from mind exile.
And pours out this playnt again,
ah myser, did I say
That I with baysterous hand should pierce
and Hippodame slay,
I do recant those words again,
in no wise it may be,
She is mine only child, which by
my wife was left to me.
Shall I embrue my hands with blood
or that do in my rage,
Which I did never yet commit
shall I thus stayne mine age?
No, no, and more then that,
she is my only child,
Then she once dead, Archadia
has few the crown to wielde,
If I were dead also, therefore
I Will search some witty wile.
Whereby I may the churlish snares
of dame fortune beguile.
And from these parched pinching pains
my self for to beguile,
And thereby for to faue her life
for if that she should dye,
I glad would be my self to wend
with her, then by and by:
And what that I did speak before
I utterly deny.
In arbor he consumes the time,
at length he does arise,
As Musa puts into his mind,
a shyfte he can devise,
Which he thinks best, this is the same:
he myndeth to ordeyne
A prize to run with chariots swifte
in field upon the plain,
And who so finds the chance
the swyftest pace to trace,
(And vanquished the king) thereby
for to depart the place
Shall wedde this dame, and when the life
of this king is in hand,
TO enjoy Arcadie realm, and erst
the king thereof to stand:
But on the other side, if that
Omaus geues the foil,
The vanquished to lose their lives
for ventring in the broyle.
Thus he decreed in mind, thereby
if happy that he be,
To win the prize, if contrary,
his own death for tosee.
And now when that he does perceive
he found no better way,
He hyes him into Palace straight,
to publish this for aye.
And then in deed he calls in
one which most mee^e he found,
For such assayes, whom he can will
with trumpe in hand to sound
In every place within the Realm,
the Cities of the land,
Proclayming to each wight these words
or like, which next do stand.
Here follows the Proclamation.
IF there be any wight that minds to try
By course of charets on the field shplayue,
And eke before the route of chyualry
Worthy seem to have reward for pain,
It stays the will of O(...) grace,
That they approach within these thyrty days
Unto the Court, where they shall find in place
Himself sole pressed to try in these assayes,
Gaynst comers all, and who so vanquished is
On fyeld by him, shall soon t^ enlo^e his life:
But who so over runs the king with bliss
Shall espouse Hipp^dami^ to his wife:
And furthermore, the Realm for to enjoy,
After the death of One mau^ king.
To him without disturbance or anoy
Of any man, and to his children after him.
Tubicen goes and passes fro,
he sounds in every place
The news, and at the last returns
and is one in joyous case,
Because that this his toil,
and tournes is so past,
The commons muse full fast on this,
and are with fear aghast,
Not knowing what the cause should be
of this so sudden change,
But for the most part they impute
this hap to fortune strange.
And as the vulgar people must,
the nobles joy again,
For each of them does think by fight
this Lady to obtain.
Then might you see the knight concur
on heaps, to have a sight
Of Hippodam unto the court
t'encourage them to fight
And they who that vile dastard hearts
before time did possess,
In hope to win this Lady bright,
them now to run do press.
So much the form of women does
enforce men for to do,
Like as they never did before,
ne like again would so,
Unless it were their enterprise
as authors old did show
And they that learned are indeed,
the very same do know.
The lusty gallants of the Court,
that proper are and tall
Do mind to venture now themselves
and hazard life and all.
The choosing is of coursers brave,
that trymly treads the way
And well is he that has the best
the chief to prove that day.
There trim they up the charets light
which put in redynesse
Each thing that they shall need in field
themselves they see to dress.
The king also himself, his horse
provided he does see,
His charets al which lightest and
most meet were thought to be.
In these affairs they do consume
and spend the thirty days
Ordeyning, and each one himself,
to try in these assayes,
Thus all things set in order due
as best were to devise*
Among the troop of chyuallers,
one Pelops does arise,
And vewing aye the seemly port
of Hippodame bright
He mynds to try himself to win
her if he may in fight.
There was that time one Myrtilus
of feigned faith a wight,
Who ruled the charet of the king
and drove the horses right.
To him does Pelops think to wend
there some mean to devise
Whereby he may prevent the king,
and bleare the lookers eyes.
And thinks with gelt to overcome
this mysers feeble mind
Or by some other way, he cares
not what, so he may find
The mean to be Archadian king
whereby he should enjoy.
This dame, and evry thing he would
without let or anoy.
And searching aye the Palace large
to find this Myrtilus
He comes to his chamber, where
at length says to him thus.
My friend, thou know that in field
the combat we shall see,
And veutrous wights to bear the fame,
amongst the chyualry,
And as I one do mind with force,
to show my self in fight
To prove if luck will happen me
to win that Lady bright.
Yet naythelesse by thy device
if I might win the same
I should reward thy veneuolence
aduauncing of thy fame.
But Myrtilus with feigned show
of friendship to his Lord
Does answer thus, in no wise I
may unto thee accord.
Think not that I for this thy gloss
of promise fine, will show
Me disobedient to my liege
to whom I service owe.
Advancement ne I crave of thee
my paynfull service may
Preferment get me of our king
wherefore thus much I say
Forsake this place, and now desist
with talk to trouble me.
Then he which to obtain his will
no mean or way did see,
Being almost in despair of hope
does hope yet once again.
To try the wight which said him nay,
although it were his pain:
Oh Myrtilus if that I may
by any means aspire,
To win the prize, and specially,
if thou helpst my desire,
Thou shall be sure to match in bed
with Hippodamie dear,
If thou can find the wile to bring,
to lucky end this gear.
We are as friends, what need these words
and circumstance of style?
Each thing shall common be with us
what ever hap the while.
What though that theu do play this pranke
art thou the first that has
Been erst unfaithful to his Lord,
for scant or else for scathe.
Let musing go, though this seem strange
yet think if king I be
I will reward this thy desert,
as thou in time shall see.
Would it not move a frozen heart
yea flinted for to bow,
To have in arms such damsels as,
are rare I make a bow?
Think therefore on the night that thou
in bed with her shall have,
Who staynes each courtly dame that shines,
for beuties gift so brave.
Now Myrtilus even as thou will
to me thine answer show,
If thou will not, I must go seek
some other wight to know
That may me aid, and think not but
if able that I be:
This thy unkindness I Will requite
what ever hap to me.
Then he that stood so stiff began turn
and unto Pelops say
More for the brunt of Cupid blind,
then any thing for aye,
If that thou list thy hest to keep,
performde as thou do vow
I Will stand content to pleasure thee,
as much as I may show.
If thou can be content, that I
as thou have said before,
Shall lie with her, I will provide
that thou need doubt no more
For I will make the Axeltree
the charet which does bear
Of wax, which by force of a crack
most suddenly shall tear
Whereby unto the ground ye know
the charet needs must fall:
In so much as the Axiltree,
does bear the charge of all.
Which being done, the course is lost
then all the prize is thine,
And therefore in the wedding night,
let pleasure first be mine.
Thou know the king at each course does
with changed charet run,
And thenrenewe his course again,
as first it was begun:
Beware that thou do not presume
to run, till thou do see
The first course and the second too
expired for to be:
Then valeantly forth preace thy self
for I will ready stand,
To offer him his wexed room,
which next shall come to hand.
Then Pelops proud of this good hap
gramercy says my friend
As now I have no more to say,
for this thy council kind,
But farewell once, for Phaeton
descendes Olimpus down,
And Phoebus shunnes Proserpina,
his foe, that hellish hound.
And I will erst depart from thee
those things for to provide
Tomorow which within the listes,
in fight I shall have need
Adue again then trudgeth he
as fast as he can fly,
Unto his chamber, where that he
does call to gods on hye
For help, but chief to Venus mylde
to whom young Paris gave
Before the rest for love of Nymph
the golden apple brave.
And since that Luna with her black
and darkened horned hut,
Does cause the sparkling stars in skies
their places to renew.
He thinks it best to clyme his bed
in sleep to spend the night,
That in the day betimes he might
be ready for to fight
The time thus does consume and wear
the night does vade away
And Phoebus getting the upper hand,
Proserpina does fray
He shows himself as cheeftain now
with chariot in the sky,
With twice two prauncing horses yt
shows his authority.
The small birds by their chirping lay
do show the time to wake,
And sluggish bed the drowsy place,
a time for to forsake
For as the day appointed is
to have with him for sight,
Of things that appertain to day
so likewise is the night
Appointed him things to be done
which appertain to light.
Therefore each wight does stir
himself for ^o prepare,
Into the field, and valiantly
his arms for to declare
Among the rest Omaus does
make open his drowsy eyes,
Unwilling he to keep his bed
does suddenly arise.
In mind to make thaduenture short
to lose or else to win.
Wherefore he hastes first himself
the array for to begin.
Those youthful seemly knights
who by their great desire
Were pricked forth to try themselves
no less: haste did require.
They thinking long the time to be
themselves to field do have
And spend not iangling here and there
the day which is far past
When it was known by sound of trumpe,
the king at point to be,
A number pressed in order brave
a man might then epsy
For to attend upon the king,
yea rather on the wight
For whose sake now each one does know
to be this broyle and sight
The king as chief and chalenger
first marches on the way,
With all the crew of noble men
him after in array,
Some with their helmes besette
with plumed feathers hye,
Some on their horses heads for show
do put the like perdie,
Which waueth with the wind:
the third but in degree
Does Pelops ride in perfect hope,
but none so brave as he
The charrets make acheere full show,
the trumpets sound would move
The heart of any wight, yea sure
the very gods above
So shrill a note with puffed cheeks,
those men with breath do sound,
That from the earth it flies to skies,
from skies again to ground.
The horses ears are filde with that
they snort, and staring stand,
They prauncing iette, to show themselves
which best might tread the land.
But Hippodame whose face has set
each heart on flamed fire,
Does follow now with troops of dames
in sad and black attire.
Not as she went the prize to see,
with joy or to behold
But as though that she went to mourn,
Oh wight of perfect mould.
Those Ladies that attend her train,
in like suite go they all,
As though they wayled some their friend,
which lately took a fall.
Thus pass they forth with measurde steps
til they come to the place
Where they appointed are to stand
as Judges of the case.
Within the lystes might no man come
unless they mind to try
Themselves, or footmen which attend
the king and Princess nie,
Each one in order takes his room
where he himself would stand,
To run his course, and take his lot
which comes next to his hand.
What should I say, the trumpets blow
the blast of battle brave,
Each one does hope by fortune good,
him self to quite and save.
And now the time is come at point
when first the king does say
He that does mind his charet first
with mine for to assay,
I will that he come show himself,
then forth one yodeth fast
And says I am the wight, sir king,
to whom first lot is cast.
Then there remains no more, but both
let run their charets light
As swift almost as Iphicus
were there be seen in sight.
But lo the king has won the prize,
as all men thought before
The trumpets sound their warbling notes
for joy of that therefore,
Then needs the law must rigor take
which sight did much appall
And dread the lookers on, so that
there is none amongst them all
That venture durst scarce for to run
but musing there they stand
At length the second takes like charge,
and enterprise in hand.
Alas, he follows the other clean,
and takes selfsame end.
For lozing aye the prize, he does
give life it to amend.
Now Myrtilus oh caytiffe vile,
is ready for to bring
With traiterous face the charet waxt
with speed unto the king.
Which taken gratefully,
the course does then renew,
By Pelops Prince of Phrygia,
in order to ensue.
But lo, ere that demi the way
the course had ouerpast
That brittle axeltree of wax
even with a thought was brast.
And fell unto the ground, wherefore
Omaus seeing this:
Draws out his goring knife or sword
with force he ne does miss
To stabbe himself nigh to the heart,
such frenzy took him then,
As scarce oppressed Hercules,
when Iunos wrath began.
The only prize is given to
young Pelops, and the name
Of Victor does remain to him
and Fama shows the same.
The persed corpse is taken vh,
and as the guyse is there,
Unto the temple of their Gods
to burning him they bear.
But Pelops takes the ready way
to Hippodamia sheene:
Where as she stood on plated stage,
to see and to be seen,
His bonet veiled, humbly he
began say her on this wise,
Due reverence once being done
his face toward the skies,
Oh rare seen spark of beuties flame,
oh Matron of the crew,
Panthora thou, whose face does stayne
bright Phoebus golden hue.
Since that the ^oas above have showed
to me such dignity,
To bear the prize of winning thee,
by true authority.
To whom I render thanks for this
I come now for to claim
And ask my right, for since by Law,
I won thee in this plain,
I judge thee mine, your Fathers hest
does testify the like.
Then she whose roseall hue was staynde
and hyd on every cheek,
By spring of crystal tears, at last
this wise to him began say,
Sir Pelops thou of Phrygia Prince
in whom virtue does stay,
Since that by arms I am your own,
I thereto do agree,
As law requires: yet as thou art
a knight, this grant to me
I may a while deplore the death
of my unhappy sire
Who causer is of his own fall
by this his fond desire.
For nature bynds the child to wayle
this day let me have sway
To morrow I for to command,
am thine, and then always
And that I may those obsequies
and rytes which appertain
To funerals fulfill, and then
thine own I do remain,
Til Atropos my vital twine
entends to cut in twain,
If thou in heart agree also,
and therefore I require
Thee for to rest thy weary corpse
and me have my desire.
Then he replete with joy, does wend
unto the Palace clear,
And Hippodame tendes the corpse
which laid is on the beer,
With woeful heart and dreary playnt,
the Ladies rest do wayle,
The king, but more because this wight
so much her moan does veil.
The triumph thus imixt is with
huge sadness and some joy,
As some lament, so some rejoice,
and thus they spend the day
Til Omaus dead inioys the flame
as worthy as may be,
After the use of Arabia
as authors testify.
But oh, prince Phaeton forsakes
with weary horse the hill,
Descending down Olympus tops
below to stay, until
By holes distinct, the time is set
t'aduance himself again.
Then evry wight betakes him self,
to bed of releast pain,
And though that Pelops throws himself,
on bed for show of rest
Yet sleeps he not, so much with joy,
his heart is ouerprest.
He hates this night, and hopes for day
He thinks it long to see,
Til that dame Hippodame she might
his spoused mate once be.
Who now her tender corpse in bed
has hid in covert wise,
Of whom likewise Somnies with stright
^a^ne approach their eyes.
Whom dalor rules, and woe restraynes
she wayles the hapless hap
Of her unlucky Father, which
Fortuna did entrap.
Yet thinks she her sorrows large,
now for to be the less
Since that for loss of father, she
an husband shall possess.
These thoughts consume and drive the night
till Sol does show his hue
And Terra glad thereof, does now
forsake her watrye dew.
Then might you see dame storas art
depaynted aye on green
How herbs start up their heds above
the ground for to be seen.
Each feathered foul disdayns yt bush
the tree is perch for night,
And resting boghs do seek their prais
in fields where they are pight.
And likewise as in siege each wight,
is stirring here and there,
Some doing this, some doing that,
all busy every where,
For this day comes in which they mind
with mirth and joy to keep.
The marriage of two princes young,
which now forsake the sleep.
The nobles of the Realm make have
and say, its time that they
Ordeine themselves the temple to
therefore to come away.
Oh if that Clio would accept,
to show her worthy art
In books to write the order that
that day was kept with heart.
Then might you see a triumph, as
if Alexandrus were
With all his iolilyke royalty,
in place among them there.
But to proceed, they sease the church
when trumpets sound the blast
Where both they ioyn in one ere that
the day was demi past.
Even as it did behoue such Peers
where both they crowned be
The king and Queen of Archadie
great joy it was to see.
Men's minds were not so fangled the^
as now they do appear
Therefore each solemn thing was done,
more rudely as I hear
But leave we them to celebrate
those things we have in hand
And reuert to the Palace, where
no wight does idle stand.
But there prepare of costly cates
a banquet rare to see,
As though the muses nine themselves
inuyted guests should be.
What should I say by all thing which
present did there abound,
It suffized then the very ground
and floor for to surround:
No heart could wish but there it was
as did thereto pertayne
No tongue can show else what did lack
but there it was full plain
The divine rites performed then
they both retire at last,
For Sol now in his woonted room,
Meridyan is plast.
Where they consume the time at meat,
two hours large or more,
The noble men attending aye
and waytyng them before.
Both Dukes and Earls with such like,
and Barons of hye prise,
Each one in office dyuersly
as best was to devise.
This dinner done, the armory
begins for to sound,
Which to the land of Pelops, and
Hippodame does redound
There Orpheus scholars show,
their masters skyll and art
Then youthly knights betake themselves
all things else s^c apart
T^ dance and raise the dames
or Nymphs almost in sight.
And so in pleasure they consume
the time until the night,
The king departs the hall himself,
as fast as he can hye,
Which Myrtilus as prone therefore,
does suddenly espy.
And thus he says, sir Pelops now,
since that you do obtain
This dame and eke the Realm, by my
industry and my pain,
I read you for to keep your hest,
the time is present now
The night draws on, therefore I pray
remember well your vow
But he these words does thunder out,
oh caytyffe borne to ill,
Oh myser most, dishonor such
woulost thou me bring until:
Oh traitor vil^, dissembler thou
thou shall have thy reward.
Because mine honor, and thy faith
thou did not regard
For thy desert and usage aye,
example thou shall be,
To other that commit such crime,
what ever hap to me.
Now Pelops calls to other, which
he studeth best to trust,
And painteth out this hap to them
of Myrtilus unjust.
Who being bound they throw on horse,
unto the sea they ride:
There plunge they in this Venus child
with this reproach that tide.
Lie there thou Lecher, thou would feign
assuage thy foul desire,
On her who is thy Leege, on whom
thou oughtst no shame require.
And yet because that by this help,
yaung Pelops gate the game,
In memory of him he would
that sea to be are his name.
This done, they all return again,
unto the woonted place
But in the City they disguise
themselves with hidden face,
And mask unto the Court, where that
they spend much time in play,
Not known whothat they were, until
they threw their mask away,
Which done the Queen departs the hall,
each wight departs to rest,
King Pelops wishing nothing less,
is thereto likewise pressed.
Where they content, both take their ease,
as both they did require,
And Pelops has the only wight,
whom most he did desire.
FINIS.
Epigrams and Sonets.
Of the most famous, renowned, and thrice happy Realm of England.
OH fertile soil, thou l^ttle land,
that Anglia has to name,
Unto whose banks and lymits set
Brutus of perfect fame
With forced shield began turn his arm
unto thee now I say,
These word to thee, in whom the waves
of honey sweet do stay.
In whom the floods of milk do run,
and (...) (...)e does flow,
Like l^n^ our Lord to his elect,
did promise long ago.
If ever thou had cause to laugh,
or joyful to be seen,
They clay thy hands, and thank the God
t(...)ue thee such a Queen.
W(...)ues do ascend and mount
unto the very skies,
And there do move the mighty Jove,
to turn to thee his eyes.
With lovely hand to pour on thee,
the seeds of this his grace
And plenty causes of all things
to abound in every place.
Within thy compass cut thou can
not truly witness this,
Before her days that like in thee
there was such cause of bliss.
Nor aye there is none other cause
by wit which thou can find
That moved God to throw on thee
such plenty thus assignde.
But her, before her days, in books
full plain its to be seen
What war, what strife, and slaughter great
in thee at once has been.
What scarcity with thee there was,
what penury each thing,
For want of grain, the lack of food
did to thy bowels bring.
The moved Gods by some thy fault,
what ever sin it were,
Did thee enforce the horror huge,
and wrack of war to bear.
By reason when the people faint,
and tired could not toil,
To till this land, whereby almost
it was vnfertile soil.
But now since none there is in sight,
oh thank thy God therefore,
And wish her life that is the cause
of this thy perfect store.
Who here in presence prays plain,
unto the Lord above,
At whose request, and whose behalf,
he poures on thee such love,
Yet think not (little Realm) that it
is for thine own assent,
Thy sin is sore, it is for her,
or else thou might be shen^.
Her virtues shine as bright as stars
as clear as Phoebus chief,
The port of her does stayne the moon
a Phoenix by her life.
For chastity Lucretia
ne could that Romish dame
Aspire to her, though while she lived
she had the only same.
Let prudent Pallas pause a space
and then for to eschew
Let ^lio muse to paint the gifts,
which Jove does her endue:
Who worthy is to rule and reign
besides her kingdoms three
Over the globe which we account,
all Chaos for to be.
What should I say, what shall I write
but land the royal race
Of her who by her passing port
staynes Iuno^s very face.
Elizabeth whose name compact,
does stand of letters nine,
The effect thereof and meaning true
in few words to define.
She loves the Muses nine, she leaves
their wisdom passinglie:
She loves the sugared skill, she loves
their laws assuredly.
Let each true subject on his knee
with thankful heart still pray
For to preserve this noble Queen,
in virtues lore always.
The queen of England, realm also
of France and Ireland
Whom God protect from all annoy
by his most mighty hand.
And grant her subjects her to serve
inheart with one accord:
While she does reign here over us,
as long as please the Lord.
And when that Atropos shall cut
and shred her web in twain,
In skies with him to joy a place,
for ever to remain.
The Author being minded to write, but la^ king an argument, made this
following, thinking whereof he were best to write.
When Phoebus in the azure Sky
Began mount with horses tracyng hye,
Then was my mind bent to endite,
Some pretty toy with pen to write.
Of quyls I had in place good store,
With ink and paper meet therefore
But arguments I wanted aye
That might conduct on the way
At length when zealous study had
Pretense to write of good or bad,
As aye my mind did give me skill,
It self reproved mine own will.
I will of kings go tell the reign,
How they in throne do hie remain.
That does sur pass my base estate
Some other thing I Will imitate
I Will write of priests, but with those
It is mad meddling in a gloss.
Of good men I will somewhat show,
But few such on earth I know
Then will I write of such therefore,
As do give alms unto the poor.
It is rare used in each place,
Ergo I will omyt that case.
Of fasting something I Will declare
But let that go it is so rare.
I Will write of rich men's huge destre,
The more they have, more they require.
But shall I talk of a blast of wind?
Then women I Will not leave behind.
Of naughtypacks I Will paynt the show,
That argument would ouerflowe.
Of whordome then shall I devise
A volume large that would comprise.
I will then flatter every man,
But many men that science can.
Then will I lie, I Will cog and face,
Nay that is used in every place.
Shall I tell truth, it is too raw,
A black Swanue I never saw.
Oh Jove what world is this to see?
Amendment no way found may be.
Omnium rerum vicissitudo.
War brings poverty,
Poverty brings peace.
Peace brings riches,
Riches brings pride,
Pride brings war.
War brings poverty, etc.
Whereas by martial power and might,
the City vanquished stays,
And ouerrun by foreign foes
denies such assayes.
Then poverty pursues with pain,
and pyncheth every wight.
With greedy gripes to show his strength,
and eke outrageous spite,
By poverty each man is forced,
to assuage his hautie heart,
And hold himself content with peace
all horror set apart.
Then aye as authors witness do,
small things for to increase,
And grow full great, as long as that
each wight enioyts the peace.
So that by peace it follows then
a man may soon obtain
The sand of golden Pactolun,
and eke the silver vain
Then if a man enioyes the pelf
of riches pleasant molde,
He falls in pride, the unhappy clog,
too high his head to hold.
Whereby he spurns against such as
his betters far are borne:
Then wat pu^sues this peace again
in former place to torn
So does this world flit always,
ne constant does abide,
And fortune whirleth very strange,
on rounded stool to glide.
Wherefore I deem each toyling wight
that traceth on the ball,
Far better aye had been unborn
ne troubled there at all.
The lover being demanded wherefore he went always in black attire, in common
datio^ of the same, made answer to his Lady on this wise,
Since that each man with bravery,
in colors does him dight,
Such as may please his mistress eye,
and answer her delight,
Some choose the green, the white some wear,
some tawney light or sad:
And some in yealow garnisht are,
in purple some be clad.
Some orient red, some watchet dye
some one, some diverse take,
And wear the same most curiously
for their fair mistress sake.
And whereas I do serve and sue
and seek to have the grace
Of her that with her lively hue
staynes all that comes in place.
To know a reason you request
what thing I should desire
That only I above the rest
in black my self attire.
The black and brown do seldom change,
they fix their lovely grace,
When other colors light and strange,
do vade within short space.
The yealow soon it waxes pale,
the russet keeps small stay*
The tawny eke will soon be stale,
the purple will decay.
The white will soil, the green will stayne
so will the loving blew:
The red will change with little pain,
and take another hew.
And so the grace is shortly gone,
their beuty soon decays,
But black is black, and always one,
and serves at all assayes.
And so the heart that you does serve
what fortune so betide,
From truth professed will never swerue
but constant still abide,
Beside all this these colors light,
does nothing else declare,
But what their fancy and delight
does will, the same they wear.
As virgin white and well beseene,
the hopeful russet bewe,
The pleasant yelow, youthful green,
and eke the faithful blewe.
Thangry red, the men forsake
in tawney choose their weed.
And thus in colors they them shape
as folly does them lead.
Of colors as is their attire,
so fleeting is their mind
They love, they leave, despise, desire,
^o stckle as the wind
But sober black presents a mind,
whom fully makes not feign,
Dame prudence there may favor find
and lodge with all her train.
And as unchanging is the hew
and eke vnmedled die,
So constant is the heart and true
that under it does lie.
And thus for this I wear the black
you may right well bel^^ue
And not for that I mourn, or lack
but that which you may geeue.
Oh were the happy hour at hand,
come were that joyful day
When you my faith will understand,
and truth uprightly way.
And so release my paynfull suit,
to lie possessed in place,
To reap the long desired fruit,
and joy the wished grace
With colors then let them depart,
whose fancy flits always
While I in black with steadfast heart
do serve you all my days.
The lover having daunced with his Lady, in the end thereof speaks these
words.
MAdam, since that you do vouchsafe
to dance about with me
I render hearty thanks, and though,
unworthy now I be,
To kiss your tender palm with mouth
yet do I naythelesse,
Remain your servant still in heart,
and place of thrall possess.
The answer to the same.
GOod sir, whereas you say that you
unworthy are with me
To dance, your pleasure and
your tongue do both agree.
You may say what you list, but this
I know to be most true,
No dame there is within this place,
condign to match with you.
Much less am I that meanest am
inferior to them all,
A worthy dame t'aspire to you
to dance within this hal:
Stoop not so low to kiss my hand
for if that you do please,
I am your own what so betide
your thraldom to release.
And think that you have gotten cut
and in this presence found
A servant true, as like that which
dame fame did once refound
Unto Penelope the fair
which was Ulysses wife.
What would you more, I am your own,
in heart whilst I have life.
Omne mundum positum est in malign tatem.
Complaining I ne can refrain
with measure just my tongue,
But he unloose with mingled tunes,
must make a doleful song.
And say as ^ullie said, when he
the Romans did accuse,
O manners, o time, because that they
all goodness did refuse.
There was not since the world was
a worser time than this
In which the Lady Virtus does
of preseats always miss.
The assembly huge of Reprobates
does more and more increase.
And treads down the simple souls,
by their most heavy prease.
Which when my mind did know, forthwith
by fear I did refrain,
This tale not meet yet for such as
do virgins pure remain.
The restless estate of a Lover, written to a fre^d of his, whrein he craves
to have some good council to ease his grief.
MY friend, the care that I sustain
and life I lead at all,
I send in paper here, as by
these lines perceive you shall.
The sluggish bed and drowsy place
I always do detest
Since I therein with weary limbs
enjoy no quiet rest.
Before that Phoebus show his beams
in morning I arise
On field to fare then forth I pass,
as is my common guise.
Where of the lusty flowers green,
and ye allow fresh of hew,
As by and over them I pass.
I take the perfect vewe.
Which colors two (though vading aye)
I like and ever shall,
For in the field while they remain
they passen colors all.
Directly then unto some hill,
or mountain fast me by,
In beaten path I take my course,
and way as it does lie.
Where long I scale with feeble legs
my self up for to get.
By reason though of troubled heart
I puff and sometime swet.
^et stint I never till that I
on highest place may stand
and top thereof, me round about,
for to behold the land
The sweling sea with surging waves
also such fowls as fly
And every thing that of the land,
or air comes me by.
The green forest which unto me
does seem most fair of all,
And every fearful beast thereof
to you which I name shall.
The mighty heart, his make the hind
the buck and eke the do.
On side of hill there rests, and
the swift amazed Roe.
The nimble long eared hare that swift
before the hound began run,
The little crarknut squirel erst
on tree, that pretty bun:
And further more I see by me,
the wily subtle fox.
The balstone or the gray does chase
and beat from clinie rocks.
Oh but at length I do perceive,
as wished with the rest,
A palace pure of pleasure, and
the place that likes me best.
And as in joy (by sight thereof)
in dumpe there still I stay
At length unto my self these words,
with warbling tongue I say.
Within thy walls and chambers fair
a perfect place of bliss,
My dearest friend, the w^ght that has
my heart, enclosed is.
Where often I wish my wretched corpse
in covert for to be,
So that no wight my sudden shape
or presence knew but she.
Transformed from my proper hew,
and changed in such wise,
As for our sureties both she could
her self then best devise.
A pretty little hound on her
with faithful heart to fowne,
I stand content so that my mind,
were present to her known.
A chirping mouse in hole to creep,
in cave or hollow wall:
When that in bed she thinks to rest,
my loving noyce were small,
A linnet in a wretched cage,
before her for to sing
With shrillish notes I would ne stay
nor stent of warbuling.
A Phillip Sparow on her fist
or elsewhere to be fed,
At her own hands twice every day
with chosen crumbs of bread.
A little Robin that does hop
about with reddish breast:
Or else if Jove would me convert,
a black flea in her nest.
In faith with force ne could I find
or think once in my heart,
The pretty naked soul from out
her sleep once for to start.
But that mine eyes at leisure might
her seemly corpse behold:
Of God that rules the rounded ball,
none other thing I would.
Thus when my weary playnt
and wishes all have sayn:
Thie me home, because the night,
approached to my pain.
Where I consume the day, until
I see the mantled night:
Which come on bed, for show of rest,
I spend until the light,
And then my course to mountain hie
again Idde renew
Of every thing as yesterday,
to take the perfect vewe
Lot here my friend I send to you
the pattern of my pain,
I crave nothing but of your hands
an answer sage again.
And as in pleasure you have been
to me a faithful friend,
So likewise in distress and grief
to show your self so kind.
Some good advice let me receive
of that thy grateful hand,
Whereby I may direct my path
as surest for to stand.
The while I will attempt with lines
and letters for to move,
The frozen heart of that good saint
me to requite with love.
If tok ens may ne boot, or that
none other thing prevail,
Then will I go and yield my self
what so ere does me assail,
And present plead for grace, but now
for once let this suffice.
My Muse and I with slender quill,
to endite will now devise.
The Lover writes to a Gentlewoman, by treaty to cause her to love him, if he
may possible.
MAdame, like as the drop that falls,
upon the marble stone,
Does peerce the same though not with strength
but with often fall thereon.
So now though that the spark of fire
be small within my breast,
Yet every day its like to be
still more and more increast.
Unless that ye vouchsafe to give
to me the oil of grace,
For to prevent the same, before
it take a root and place.
Therefore these lines which I here send,
do pray to have relief,
To flow from you, to him that is,
your servant during life.
For since that Cupide with his dart
has hit the mark that he
Did shoot at with his blunted bolt,
which stock he made of me:
And since there is no creature that
can rid me fro my grief,
But only you, Oh Lady mine,
or cure my noyed life,
I send you here with faithful mind,
a present, though but small,
Now take my hand, and eke my heart,
yea take my life and all,
To pleasure you il that ye list
ne never to deny,
Let me enjoy the name and place,
your siruant to supply:
Let this suffice till that I know
the tenor of your mind,
Whether ye list to give long life
or death unto your friend.
One of these two you may prevent,
for both rest in your hand,
If that you list Panthora mild,
since I in hope do stand:
And as I do perceive the cause
of joy or else of grief
I Will say it does proceed from you
be it of death or life.
Go pass to her ye printed lines,
that does possess my heart,
If that you cause me to receive
some comfort of my smart,
I shall rejoice, but if ye give
to me a froward style,
I shall be prone, and with good will
from life me to exile.
By him that has bin here before
your own, and so is now:
And for to be your own he has
yplight a faithful vow.
Here the Lady writes an answer to the letter of her Lover, perseuering in
her stubburnesse: nothing ruing his faithful heart.
YOur lines sir, that you sent
to me but of late days,
I have perusoe, as meet I thought
to be for such assayes,
And si^h that you request
to have an answer ayne,
I stand content to do so much,
since you in hope remain,
To put you out of hope,
think not I am so feign,
To grant so soon unto your hest
that were but folly plain:
Go choose and take your make
some elsewhere to be found.
I am not one that will so soon
in any band be bound.
And you to be as free,
as erst you were before,
Leave of I pray you by my read
and trouble me no more.
Yet say not naythelesse
that I the causer stay
And am the weauer of your woe,
that were no likely way.
Though that your pleasure were
to forge such feigned style
And by the silver hook to catch
the fish that fears no gile.
The love is very hot
for which a man would kill
Himself, I know it very well
that is a painful ill.
Though Pyramus that wight
with sword did peerce his heart,
For Thisbie, and she likewise did
of like death take a part.
They two are dead in deed,
they two be laid in stone,
We never shall find out by sight,
their like now they are gone.
Now doubt I whether that
the like love flow from you
Therefore content your self yt while,
I must needs say adue.
By her that loves not aye,
To spend her words inwast
Wherefore she sends but few lines
To thee, farewell in have.
The letter of a friend of a wounded Lover, wherein he goes about to dissuade
him from this lovely folly.
MY friend your parched letters are
late happened to my hand
And them with eye I have perusde,
and every sentence scande.
Whereby I do perceive that you
do languish still in pain,
And now according to request,
I write to you again.
That I with dreary plaint accuse
and wayle the haples hap
Wherein blind Cupid Venus son
did lately you entrap.
But yet small remedy I find,
if she so froward be
As in your letters you report,
and show the same to me.
But that ye do refrain from love
me thinks that the wight
That lerning has might well prevent
and stop such peevish spite.
Love is not of such force and strength,
as far as I can show,
But if it be by learning you
better then I do know.
Then fix your mind some elsewhere aye,
where you may reap the fruit
For which you have so toyled long
by painful suite.
But if you cannot soon withdraw,
from her your yielded heart
And thereby to exile your self,
from this your snared smart.
Then wander hence away into
some Country farther off,
If you can aye forbear a while
this soil to dwell aloof,
And there with troop of chivalry
to exercise your self
In feats of arms, thereby to shun,
of loytring love the elfe.
Such facts will clean exile, and drive
from out your mazed mind
These pranks, insomuch yt they shall
no place hereafter find.
The Adage old does show us plain,
and as I have heard say,
Long out of sight, clean out of mind,
and I believe it aye.
Then if that you attempt some way,
and work some witty wile,
By favor of your friends to fare
a little in exile,
And cut the calmed seas, the land
to tread at the other side
You soon then would leave of your love
which now in heart you hide.
And if your heart does not assent,
in foreign fields to trace,
The^ in some town within this realm
you must find out some place,
For you that have the store of wealth,
may lead your life as best
To court it out with other brave,
and royst among the rest.
In Court great knowledge is,
to which you may aspire,
If that you list with zealous pain
to apply your whole desire,
And in the Court also you shall
perceive some condign dame,
That may extinguish clean the print
and spark of the other flame.
In time to come perhaps also,
I say you shall rejoice,
And laugh to see this link, the which
you left have by my voice.
Percha^ce yt gods have you preserved
until some better end,
Then may you joy by right with me
that stands for your friend.
But if you mind not aye to pass,
into some other land:
Nether to serve in princely Court,
in Courtly room to stand.
Then fix your earnest mind
to aspire to knowledge hie
By study of the common laws,
a Councelor to supply.
And leave such fondly toys
wherein you now do frame
And trace your steps, yt more to tred
your present woe and pain.
And give the common law the fame,
when each trade does decay,
The proverb old as you know well
does likewisy to us say;
No fishing to the sea there is,
nor service to a king.
No such game as the trade of law
does to our coffers bring,
The trade of Law does fill to brinke
from bottom boisterous bags
They royst in silk, when other range
the street in rented rags.
Now judge your self which of the twain
does give show best to be.
With one of them I would that you
in heart could aye agree.
If that you like not aye the change
of dames within the court:
For Country prilles your youthful life
with them to lead in sport.
Or if you more esteem the sight
of her that ways not you:
More then the gilt that Law does get
by learning to ensue.
I know not what thing I shall say,
but wayle the froward fate,
Which unto you the Gods have grant,
to purchase peevish hate.
Thus now adue my friend, mark well
these lines which I do send,
And sometime let me hear from you,
how that you do entend,
The Lover writes once more to his friend, as does follow after.
THe pains that you have taken sir,
an answer to indite,
Unto my letter that I sent
with thanks I here requite.
Not able any other way by gifts
to recompense the same.
But with my pen a few lines
in paper here to frame.
Whereas you say I should refrain,
and keep my self from love,
That were too hard, since love it self
has forced the Gods above.
What moved Jupiter to turn
himself to take the shape
And form of Bull, but only love,
for dame Europas rape?
And for because (my friend) you say
love is not of great strength,
As far as knowledge gives you,
it shall appear at length
Did not loves law enforce that Jove
to turn in Eagle strange,
When that Asterion he could
accept into his grange,
He took on him the form of swanne,
as Leda when he had,
Under his feathred wings and breast,
in safety for to shade.
A Satyr strange, he forced him self,
that Jupiter by name
Saturnus son, to the intent
he might Necteis clame,
In form of golden shower when that
to Danae he could clyme
In tower strong, for pleasure then
with her to joy a time.
Thus lose did he his former face,
as love did often compel,
Besides him other gods also,
which all I can not tell.
But if that Poets tales seem true,
then did Neptunus turn,
And had the face of other beasts,
a Ram sometime to form,
Sometime a lusty horse to be,
fometime a fish to play,
As of a Dolphin take the hue
as love did bear the sway.
And did not erst Apollo take
the shape of Raven black
Sometime a shepherd in the field
to bring his lust to sack?
No god was free, since all the shape
of changed forms began take,
Of beasts or birds, and oftentimes
of foul of fish of lake.
Then say not that love has no force,
the proverb thus does say,
Amor vincit mundum, and then
nothing so strong does stay.
And where as you do give advice
me to withdraw my mind,
And fix my heart some elsewhere, that
I may some favor find.
Alas can I withdraw my thought,
or else auert my heart
From her whose picture still I find
within my breast impart:
No no, or else and shall I grant
to wander in exile,
And drudge about as one unknown,
thus desolate the while:
I can not aye endure that trade,
and where again you say,
I should me try in feats of arms,
and so drive love away,
For once from sight clean out of mind,
prouerbially you speak.
That is most true of such as would
there vowed promise break,
My heart, aye gives me power enough
in foraine lands to wend,
And over surging seas to glyde
t'arriue at the other end.
Yea if I had a thousand lives,
I would them venture all
For her, if that at my return
reward for pain might fall.
Or where to serve in princely court
your hest does me advise,
He that adventures such affairs
had need be very wise
In court though that great dignity
be to be gotten aye,
I have no mind to such attempts
for things that I shall say.
In court at times to dice and card,
a man must venture often,
His winnings one time will be small,
his losings come aloft,
A man must not deny to play
an hundred pound or twain,
If that he mind to bear a name,
though nothing else he gain:
And other exercises store,
which when a man does meet
With such as stand more than his match
his winning goes to fleet.
The Court a sit place is in deed
for such as know no end
Of wealth, and such as heap up more
than they may yearly spend.
Such lusty laddes n^^de take no dread
how that the(...)se or win,
Their tenants toytl, they know not how
their worldly wealth comes in.
And some by parents wise have now
such order in their land
And Bounds well set, that they ne (...)de
about it fyle their hand.
And where you think in court there is
such store of damsels fair,
Though they were like the Muses ^ine,
that trece above the air:
Yet if that Enthinimias
in court did aye remain
More beauty she should show by sight,
than any other twain
Though that she be a country prill,
no weight thereof does stand,
Think you that some those Courtly dames
are not of country land?
Yea though that they have changed place,
and eke their wonted guise,
Yet country Lady* they are still,
as far as I devise.
If that you know the contrary,
suppose that if this dame,
(Though stubborn she) were set in court,
should she not bear the name
To be a Courtier eke most fit:
small is the difference
Now put ^ff you, if that ye (...)st
to give intelligence
And also of your other choice,
I like much as the rest.
The study of the common laws
I ne account as best:
To bend my mind unto that side,
I think it folly plain,
The way is long and tedious,
so much more is his pain
That tries it, and if such store
of gold be got thereby,
I wish some friend that has no wealth
his mind thereto apply:
But as for me, I thank the Gods
that blessed me such wise,
I greatly ne (as Proverbs say)
do need to rub mine eyes.
And this I know for certainty,
that he which linkes in jove,
To earnest study any t^me
his mind can never move.
None of your choices three I like
but pensive do remain.
My sorrow grows more and more
I feel the worser pain.
And where yon raise request to kno
how that I do entend
The copy of my letter aye,
and hers before I send.
Thereby you may perceive and see
how small she does esteem,
The cankred care whereby I cry,
and stand at very brimme,
Of Stigian lake, yet do I mind,
ere many days be past,
T'assay again, for many men
say Love comes not in have.
Yet will I pause a while,
and think on evrie point,
At length when I perceive my time
I Will venture out a joint.
And then renew my painful suit,
which now does stand begun
It will be long ere that I end
the feeble fools are wun,
With little care as I have learnd
thus fare you well from T.
Where often to give me council good
I wish you for to be.
The lamentation of a lover being refused, showing no hellish torments to be
like his, wherewith he accuses his Ladies cruelty, and yet at length prays
to have relief.
COme on thou heart yt long have slept in wo^,
Revive thy self thy haples hap to show,
Ye senses all closde up with covert care,
Unloose your selves my sorrows to declare:
Thou tongue that tied art by string of pain
Be pressed to show the woe where I remain,
Thou hand yt long have staid stretch out at last,
To show the present grief and sorrows past,
Of him that dying lives and wishes death,
Though dead in heart yet always draws breath
A thousand times for woe who still does cry,
And wishes death each day and cannot die.
Though Ixion nailed on the whirlmg wheel,
Which hellish stubs and irksom pains does feel,
Though Tantalus amyd the lake therein
Parsues yt waves which wet and wash his chin,
And when to hun deceiude it promise makes
The^ fleets yt flood, his dryth and thirst ne slakes
Though yt the tree with aureal fruit does stand
By him, and when he reaches out his hand
The^ flies yt stock on which the fruit does grow
So bides he pain, and feels excessive woe.
Though Titus heart did lie a perfect pray
To flying fowls, this pain he bides always,
Though Danaus daughters fill in vain
The watery vessels, and in toil remain,
Yet none of these for grief may ay compare
With me, for Clio may not yet declare
Ne paynt each parched pain, whereby I pyne,
Though she had all the help of Muses nine,
Or else express with slender quill in hand,
That each wight might it fully understand.
Such dangrous dread does double in my breast
For her, who reweth not this my unrest:
Ah frosen heart, ah wight of marble moulde,
Ah fem as fierce as Tygre to behold,
Oh wolf of visage fell, who would devour
Each simple lamb, that joys but slender power,
Thee to the noble Lion to compare,
Were folly plain since he this virtue rare
Enioyes, who never does delight, with force
To tear the sely beast yt yeldeth to his might,
But then ^s victor to return away,
And somewhere else to seek a condign pray.
But thou whose mouth delights still to feade,
Art not content my corpse on ground to tread,
But ay to rent and tear my giltlesse heart
In pieces small by this my woe and smart.
If that thy pleasure be to feed on me,
So say, i will pull my heart to give it thee,
Thereby for to assuage thy hot desire,
Thereby of life to extinguish out the fire.
What would thou more to do thy body good?
I would on dagger fall to spill my blood,
Or else with lancing knives to cut my flesh,
To make thereof for thee a dainty dish.
Then grant and yield to this my one request,
I wish no more to breed my quiet rest.
When Cupid shot at me first with his dart,
And by the blow did peerce my tender hurt,
I knew no salve to cure my sore again,
But thereby did remain pensive for pain,
Till Amor now by sleight the mean did find,
To rid the same if thou ne grow unkind.
Rue then thou frozen har^ and stomach dire,
With friendly words grant now yt I require.
Let me enjoy soon, eke the place possess
Thy self, and thereby my woe redress,
So me for to requite with love again,
Since I in heart thine own shall still remain,
Till sisters three shall rid my vital twine,
Thy love let me have aie, for thou have mine.
Grant this ye gods that glide on starrie sky,
And guide that Chaos ball most equally,
What joy were this to me that am a thrall,
If thou thy mate would me once friendly call,
Since I so often have travail spent in wast,
To reap the wished fruit now at the last.
The Lover having written many times, almost past hope, yet does renew his
playnt again.
ALthough that here before my dear
I written have in wast:
And sent my lines to thee in vain
expressing sorrows past.
Yet hope does hag me to incline
with pen once for to paynt
The staggering staff whereby I stay
and show to thee my playnt.
And though that yet thou alwais have
been ruler of my care
Yet now at length a gentle wight
do thou thy self declare.
If any spark of mercy stay
now flaming in thy breast
Then say the word that pr(...)t may,
and bring me wished rest.
Let not the guiltles ghost g^ue up
the cynders to the soil
But let your mercy be (...)aid
to help him give the fail.
To hateful hap, let not my corpse
to Charon breery (...),
By passage over Stigian take,
a burden aye to see.
Let not the wight that now enioyes
half years to run his race
So soon depart from terra green,
in Tartar to have place.
Since you may give him light yt now
in darkness does remain,
Since you may give him freedom yt
in thraldom stays for pain.
Think on the faithful heart
of him that said thee so:
Think on the meaning true of him
that wandreth still in woe.
Think erst ^n him that does not ay
esteem his borrowed life:
To pleasure you if you vouchsafe
to remedy his grief.
And now since that you understand,
the secrets of my mind
Let this suffice I say, until
an answer be assignde.
And though that many sundry times
I trauayled in was^^
I weigh it not so that I may
have mercy at the last.
By him that states in heart your own,
as long as life does last
And if that love be after life,
your own when life is past.
The lover being denied, yet sings this song being constant, with hope to
obtain her at the last that may reward him for his pain.
THough surging seas do compass me,
Of carking cares on every side,
Yet trust I once to range most free,
And to the joyful valley glide,
And ^ke the wight for to obtain,
That may release me from my pain.
Though she says nay to my request,
And does deny my true desire,
Disdayning aye to breed my rest,
Whereby I freeze amid the fire,
Yet trust I once for to auart
Thus stubborn sternnesse from her heart,
My lady calls it folly plain,
With tongue such hardened knot to knit,
As all the teeth with help of brain,
Shall ne be able to vnc(...)t,
She wrappeth wily wit so sure,
It to obtain its very dure.
She doubts least that I mean awry,
She fears least my heart be frail.
She thinks I love not faithfully,
But outwardly her to assail,
She thinks aye my tongue to flee
In words, with heart ne to agree.
Oh that Cassandras gift were plain,
And worthy skill for her to guess,
If that I list in heart to feign,
Contrary to that I profess,
Then should be seen the great good will,
I bear to her, and shall do still.
Yet I ne blame that silly wight,
Though circumspect always she be,
Unfaithful love has brought much spite,
The proof whereof we daily see,
By such as think contrary aye,
In hare to that which tongue does say.
Yet I am none of those I vow,
I love her truly in my heart,
As is my thought the same I show,
In outward words with woe and smart,
Wherefore these words I say certain,
That justly I should her obtain.
Though long it be ere I arrive
The joyful haven to possess,
Though long I wretch do wear the give
And careful clog of heaviness,
Yet hope I once to see that day
To have my love and none say nay.
The Lady by often entreaty being vanquished with love, does write a
comfortable letter to her Louet.
DEsist my Philo friend, to plunge
or welter still in pain,
Where flowing aye the noisome waves,
of woe always remain.
Leave off to wail or mourn for that
which thou did deep desire.
Since I am pressed with zealous care,
to extinguish out the fire,
And the vnwasting coal that lies,
now hid within thy breast,
In covert wise, and by my means
to bring thee cause of rest.
Desist with pen to paint the pain,
which compast thee each side,
Or doleful tunes to show the grief,
in which thou did abide.
Leave off that black attire, wherein
thou use for to go,
A perfect hew (as same report)
and stgne of wicked woe,
And fall to mirth, to joy with her,
that comes to ease thy smart.
Thy earnest suite has found a place
to lighten on my heart.
Though once restraynd by force I fled
and thereto would not bow,
For reasons rough, this one among
the rest I do allow
In books I readen have full often,
and others many a time:
Of maids deceived by wyly wyghts
and led in loathed crime.
For Satan means most deceit,
when Angels shape he takes,
The fish is trapped soonest with,
the silver hook in lakes.
I doubted aye the like, until,
that I enioyde the gift,
Which once Cassandra held, that had
been aye a present shift.
For to discern and know thereby
the secrets of thy mind
If that I should thee faithful, or
a plain dissembler find.
For this you know as well as I
this is the greatest care
Of maids, how they bestow themselves,
in lovely bands to fare.
And how they knit themselves in league.
though love be very strong:
And not for pleasure small to sing
always a mournful song.
But since that I by proof perceive
thy meaning true to be,
And without fraud I stand content
herein to pleasure thee:
Then aye persist in steadfast faith
for ever to endure.
And me in heart to be thine own,
to find thou shall be sure.
Now fare thou well my only care,
my steadfast staff of joy:
The only comfort of my life,
whom Jove keep from annoy.
By her that loves thee aye,
more better than her heart:
If theu consent to yield thereto,
till death shall aye depart.
The joyful lover having by earnest suit obtained her whom he loved, made this
ditue following.
COme on ye lovers that long have rest in woe,
Leave off your sobs so tearing,
And help my joyful hap to show
A face of laughter bearing:
Come on all ye I say again,
Your Ladies favor which obtain,
And let us all sing.
For we have past the greatest ieopat die that might
Have wrought us any woe or grief
Now we arrive the haven chief
And pass the sea of spyght.
Though Cupides arow piercde my tender heart
And brought to me such payning,
Yet now exiled is my smart,
My dear I thus obtaining,
I joy with her that joys with me,
I love no wight so well as she,
For like this joy knew I never non before that day
In which these words were to me shown
Come on my dear, thou art mine own,
I will thee love always.
What words of comfort were these now think you all
To bring such liberty to me,
When I had lived long in thrall,
At last that day set to see,
I ne remember now my woe,
Which me compassed long ago,
Therefore let us sing.
For I am recompensed well for this my pain,
I have the wight that I love best,
Her words do bring to me such rest,
I wish none other gain.
Ye Gods yt rule the rounded ball grant this to me
I ask unfeignedly,
If I love byr with faithful mind,
As I love her, let her love me,
And not the contrary,
Let her ne grow in heart unkind,
And then may I sing,
And purpose truly to love her always in my heart
What ever hap shall aye befall,
Yea though I lose my life and all,
Till death us two depart.
Tempus rerum edax.
Nothing there is but aye,
at length does vanish clean,
For time does wear away,
such things as earthly been.
The Rose for all his hue,
the skarlet Gillowfloure,
The Vyolet so blewe,
do vanish in one hour.
The tree that grows big,
and windeth every way,
Does once rot every twigge,
when time says now, decay.
The wight that here is borne,
at last does lose his breath,
Though many ways he turn,
and would not meet with death.
The marble stone most sure,
that lies; under feet,
Can not always endure,
but goes once to fleet.
The king that sits in throne,
with golden mace in hand,
At length shall be as none,
but earth on him to stand.
The house wherein we trust.
though hard as flint it be,
At length shall wear to dust,
a heap of stones to see,
The castle set on hic,
on hill that stands stout,
Its seen that time does try,
and beat the sollage out.
The church that coured is
with lasting lead above,
At length time does ne miss,
his beauty to remove,
A door of brass strong made
of iron or such like,
Time causes once to glad,
and with decay it strike.
The rock that stands strong,
amyd the foaming flud,
Though that it lasts long
time beats it to mud.
The sea banks that are bie,
and seen from land to land,
Time wastes utterly,
aye farther for to stand.
The Gun that by his strength
can turrets overthrow,
Time does consume at length
his power and might to show.
The hill that stretches long,
and casts out his side,
As time does come more strong,
then he in fall does glide.
The stars that in the sky,
most thick set do remain,
Do fade immediately,
when time does come with main.
The sun that shines so bright,
shall lose his comely grace,
And show no spark of light,
as time does take his place.
The moon that wandreth fast,
and shines on the land,
Must needs decay at last
when timely power is scande
The world of compass round,
in fashion of a ball,
At length shall not be found
when time consumes it all.
Nothing there rests still
but consumes by and by,
When time does show his will
then vades the earth and sky.
The Lover being willed of his Lady to attire himself in black and blewe,
demanded the reason, to whom she made this answer following by a letter.
BEcause that you (my dear) request
to know herein my will:
Wherefore that you in black and blewe,
should aye attire you still.
The black is said by right report,
most constant to remain:
And ne to change that color sad,
for any other grain.
The blewe presents the wearers mind
and eke a loving heart:
Be tokening lovely lyking still,
not soon aye to depart.
Then join these two in one, and if
thy raiment touch the black,
Imixt with blewe a lace or like
my love ne fet it lack.
For as the black presents a face
of faithful trust to stay,
So does the blewe aye represent,
a loving heart always.
And for a token of true love,
my joy I send to thee
Enclosed here those colors two,
wear thou the same for me,
Wherein is tide a slight present,
in recompense of thine,
A tablet wrought, I give it thee,
it is no longer mine:
As often as you wear the same,
for my sake and for me,
Then wish me well, for be thou sure,
I wish the like to thee.
The Lover writes to his Lady, wherein he condiscendeth to wear the colors
that she wills him for her sake.
IN colors two since you request
I should my self attire,
As black and blew, I stand content
to answer your desire,
For where as black presents a mind
whom folly makes not feign.
A color fit it is for me,
changing for none other grain.
If blewe a loving mind present,
and eke a faithful heart,
It is for me that ne does mind,
from constant love to start.
But by the gift that you me sent,
I can not recompense
Enough, though daily I apply
thereto my full pr^^nce.
Yet though I have no gift to give,
that worthy is of thee.
In place of other yet let this
suffice now sent from me:
And though it be a gift but light,
or recompense but small,
I give my hand, I plight my faith,
I send my heart and all.
That keep until I do repair
to thee, though it belong,
My self to joy in arms of love,
and sing a joyful song.
Farewell my joy, farewell my life,
farewell my heart to thee,
Farewell thou wight to whom I wish
more good then erst to me.
To him that was disappointed of his woman and lover.
TO freat thy self in frantike wise,
to beat thy senseless brain,
To clyme where nothing hangs for thee,
to fish where slowes no gain,
Me thinks it booteth not at all:
desist with speed therefore
The enterprise thou have in hand:
this saw has bin of yore,
That hard it is for to convert
a woman's vowed mind,
Such stern and stubborn kind of God
to them is so assignde.
Her love not bent is toward thee,
whom thou do fix in heart,
An other does with joy possess
the wight that breeds thy smart.
Yet for to ease thy mind, here is
enclosde I send to thee
In token of benevolence,
a wreath of willow tree.
The lover writes in the praise of his Lady wherein he does compare her to a
Laurel tree that is always green.
LIke as the Bay yt bears on branches sweet
The Laurel leaf that lasts always green
To change his hue for weather dry or wee^,
Or else to lose his leaf is seldom seen.
So does my dear for aye continue still,
As faithful as the loving Turtle dove,
Rewarding me according to my will,
With faithful heart for my most trusty love,
And since the time that we our love began,
Most trusty she, yet has endured aye,
And changes not for any other man.
So constant she of faith in heart does stay.
Wherefore unto that tree I her compare,
That never loses leaf, no more does she
Lose tried truth, how ever that she fare,
But always one by love in heart to me.
The^ bost I on this bra^ch of Bays most pure,
Since that so sweet I find it at my heart,
And love while that my life shall aye e(...)re,
And till that death our bodies two shall part.
The pretty birth of a child.
IT fortund late a Frenchman for to dwell
In England, where himself he quited well.
And took an Ihishwoman to his wife,
Having by her a child of perfect life:
Now if this child beginning shall retain
Of fathers side, a Frenchman he is plain,
But contrary, if of the mother he
Shall take the spring, he Irish is to see.
But some say, that he shall be of the land
Where he was borne, the^ english shall he stand.
The words of a dame concerning her Lover, spoken to one Mistress Anne.
IN faith goo mistress Anne I have
found out a make in deed,
A proper man, and tall, and one
that seems will stand in steed.
I love him well, more then I fay,
I wish to him his good,
I love him like mine own dear heart
or else my vytall blood.
For this you know that I ne love
my blood once for to see,
No more I do delight that he
within my sight should be,
In praise of his Lady.
E ELisa dame that Carthage Queen,
N Ne Polixena fair beseene,
T T'aspire unto my Ladies hew,
H Helena ne with all the crewe,
I In passing sort may not compare,
N Nor vaunt them selves for beutie rare.
I In circuit huge her like n^ is,
M Miron may muse and talk of this.
I In Greece though Apelles did frame,
A A picture clear of Venus dame,
S Sertaine she does the same excel
Of whom these lines the name do tell.
Of four kinds of men that may sing at didner, and other meat meals.
THe Gentleman that has the store
of worldly wealth, may sing
At meals of meat, for pleasure great
that pleasant songs may bring.
And next by order check, the fool
that joys none other grain,
May sing and garre as does the bird
against a shower of rain.
The Minstrel then that fidleth ^^ne
at feeding times may play,
And sing to heap into his pursse
the coin by night or day,
But chief, though last, the old cock may
or cockold ne be dull
To crow and sing fond fantasies,
to hag from horned scull.
Of covetousness and Lechery together.
A Pursse full fraught with gold,
as worldly misers frame,
Had one at codpice point, who tied
with niggish kno: the same:
Thus were these two together k^it,
and ioynde in amity,
A pursse with pelf of couetise,
at lace of lechery.
A perfect trick to kill little black flees in ones chamber.
TAke half a quart of barley grain
a quart of strongest beer.
And boil withal in earthen pot,
a pint of water clear,
Till all these three consumed be
to ounces twelve or less,
And then the place to which you will
these fleas in heaps to press,
Anoint with that: this water has
in it this virtue raw
That all the fleas will thither come:
then take a slender straw,
And tickle them on the small ribs,
and when you see one gape,
Thrust the^ the straw into his mouth.
and death he ne shall escape.
Each thing in his vocation.
THe preests ensearch for funerals,
and flatterers haunt the feast,
The surgions seek the maimed, and
the Ravens carreyne creast.
The frailenesse of women.
AN apple winnes her mind,
it lost is with a nut:
Her tongue hangs filed with no edge,
yet it will quickly cut.
To his friend of the fruilenesse of dame Fortune.
VVHo^ fortune does most smilingly advance
Those sonest does she cast unto ye ground
Unequal hap she holds still by chance,
For to extol, or else defame by sound.
I read somewhat of Polycrates ill,
Who never felt the fell adversity,
Yet dreading lest she once would work her will,
Into the sea did throw (to satisfy
Her brittle mind) a ring of value great,
Yet fortune thought to show her power and might
And forced a fish with gulching jaws to eat
The same: which given to the king, by sight
The ring appeerde: with marvel he at last
Was captive taken of great Orontes king,
And strangling string about his neck yeast,
Was forced adieu unto his life to sing.
Learn thou by this I say my gentle friend,
That riches rank, ne yet the precious stone
Can once defer this fortune so unkind,
For if it might this king had not been gone,
And for because that thou art set so bie,
And placed stayest in seat of this degree
Unwilling aye to lose authority,
I cannot choose but now advertise thee
To train thy selse in such wise thou may have
(If fortune frail should hap to slip from thee)
Each man's good will, whereby he might thee save
From dangers dread, which yt might happily see,
For now a thing not rare it is in deed,
That where we wey our footesteps best to be
With slippery place then soonest do we slide
Therefore mark well that I have said to thee.
The morning before the Lover went to his Lady, made this petition to the Gods.
Gold is a sign men say
of happy luck and love,
Then grant ye Gods I pray
that rule the sky above,
This my request to me,
that since that I this night
Did dream such gold to see
as answered my delight,
That I may hear such news,
of her that has my heart,
Like as joy still insues
to rid me from my smart.
And Venus Gods mild,
to whom the apple gave
Young Paris Prince a child
a noble dame to have
Grant that I may by suite,
have her I do request:
And I will give the fruit,
to thee before the rest.
The foolishnes of a painter.
REpairing to a Painters place
to view such pictures rare
As he with pensil fine had framde
the fame away to bear.
Me thought I saw such pictures there,
of beauties darlings brave,
As did surpass, and condign were
the only brute to have.
Whereby it seemde he far had sought*
by sea and eke by land,
Each passing part of womanhood,
with eye had rightly skand.
At length his wife discending down,
a passing piece in deed,
Me thought I never saw her like,
attyrde in woman's weed.
Who there did draw mine eyes to her,
from pictures clean away,
By whom was plain dame beuty then
her banner did display.
And vewing there each perfect point
which nature did apply,
That s^ly soul in co^ert wise,
I speak thus by and by:
Thou paynter that with curious eyes
have seen each courtly dame,
In mind thereby by sight of such
a picture rare to frame,
What dydst thou mean to seek so far,
and have at home a wife,
For beuty which knows not her peer
with woman which are chief,
Thou fool, if that thou list in deed,
with pensell to detrayne
A picture that all other shows
of pictures aye should stayne,
Or if thou meanst to frame a show
of beauty caught in net,
And such one as the jail thereby
thy self thou erst might get,
Then forge the picture of thy wife,
and travail not for pain,
Since she the chief of beauties stock,
among us does remain.
The grievous complaint of him that had the hap to marie his mistress.
When youthful years did prick me forth
in stature for to grow
A tall young man, and towardnes,
(to call) by sight to show,
I did request in heart to be
a serving man a space,
Whereto my friends did condescend,
and wished me their grace.
A master meet my parents chose,
as best they thought in mind,
That should in service me retain,
since I thereto was clynd,
A gentleman of antike stock
by alltance very good,
By pedigree and just descent
he came of gentle blood:
And sticken deep in years, this wight
a wife he had before,
A passing dame, a pleasant wench,
of beutie which had store.
They did continue many years,
in virtues ways most pure
With faithful love and amity,
and frendships lore most sure.
In so much that there was cause gin
to neighbors round them by,
To blaze this brute in every place,
by fame both far and nic,
Happy to be that aged soul,
and luckie for to stand,
That had by Gods appointed him
a wife to lead in hand,
That aye dame beuties baner brave
displaied in such wise
Withal, for virtue in no place
her like might once arise:
Well, to ensue, dame Atropos
can shread his web in twain,
Leaving no issue him behind
as his heir to remain.
Whereby the right of land and lease
of silver and of gold,
Descended solely unto her,
for ever it to hold.
Then was this widow often sought,
in marriage league to wend,
But she refusing offers large,
to none would condescend,
Then I remembering many times
her virtues manifold,
The seemly port, the comely grace
which she by sight did hold
But chiefly aye the worldly wealth
and riches pleasant store,
That by her husband was her left
surrounding aye the flore.
Was moved much by Cupid blind
for to attempt with maine,
If that I might this passing wight
by any means obtain.
And being daily conversant
I wrought the matter so,
That in short time my hearts desire
I obtainde^o my woe.
The marriage made, most joyful I
in heart did aye remain
I never knew what sorrow meant
ne felt what thing was pain.
Ah pleasantly we did consume
two months and no more,
In pleasant wise then did I think,
to sue to get some store,
Of gold if that I might,
I knew she had the same,
And fruitful bags, but in no wise,
I could one crown reclayme:
And as request was made of me,
this answer by and by,
Was gin of her in crooked wise,
and aye most frowardly,
Good sir, I wedded not for that,
advancement ne you gave
To the intent that any store
of mine you should thus crave,
And think to be your own, but this
much I do to you say,
If that you stand to my reward,
your labor i will repay:
And what I give you take,
mine offer ^e refuse,
I was your mistress till I gave,
you license me to use.
Such as is yours is mine,
and mine is sure mine own:
Then none ye have, ne none ye get,
unless friendship he shown.
But I with rage and choler moved,
ne could my self refrain,
To me it was a present death,
and erst a piercyng pain,
That I should be a woman's thrall,
that I should be a slave,
That I in place of husband, should
none of her substance have.
It moved me in deed, so that
though clean against my vow,
I was constraynd by fury fell
some blows for to bestow,
But out alas, her friends forthwith
began give her freendly aid,
Whereby I trodden down to ground
in mind was aye dismayde:
And she puffed up by passing pride,
her head was grown so hye
Above my pate, that able she
was it with nails to clye,
With pot, with candlestick, and eke
with bedstaffe of huge weight,
Both stool and form flang at my face,
with care thus I was freyght.
On every fide, oh miser most:
oh caytyfe borne to pain,
Oh devils drudge, oh frantike fool,
that marry would for gain:
When I in stable serude the horse,
Then was I wearier aye,
On bench with clownes whole penny up,
at treygobet to play
Than I am now beside all this,
and which does grieve me more,
Of horns by her vile whoredom strong,
accrueth to me store.
No remedy I find the while,
for still before my face,
Roysters, ruffins, she retaynes
in bed, my rightful place.
Wherefore a thousand times I wayle
my state and mysery,
A thousand times I call for death,
yet naythelesse can dye:
I shall live longer than I would,
in thrall with mickle shame,
Oh God what hap had I, when first
I wedded home my dame.
The Lover by pleasant talk caused a Lady to understand how a shrew or
unhappy woman came first into the world.
LEt no man muse but this was first
the offspring of a shrowe,
As I in lines here subsequent,
shall cause you for to know.
When as for sin the thunderer
love did the earth surround,
And overwhelmed aye with waves,
each part of heavy ground:
Deucalion only saved was,
and Pirrha then his wife,
(As Poets say) of mortals, and
he longest ioyed life.
And when perceiuerance did him take
that every wight was gone,
And that they two and no more
on earth were left alone,
Then pensiuely they took advice
to Them^s for to wend,
To wete how mankind might again
his former life entend.
This Goddess can reply them to,
wi^h answer on this wise,
If that Deucalion could find out
by sight of greedy eyes,
His mothers bones, and him behind
they thrown for to be,
Within short time they should start up
men living for to be,
This marvel much dismaide the mynds
of these two seely wights,
As though that they did fearful stand,
by sight of hellish sprights:
But this Deucalion being wise,
perceived at the last,
The earth mother to be of all
things that are now and past:
And erst to be the spring wherehence
all mortals first did flow.
By reason then of earth he was
(by wit) he prompt did know,
And aye her bowels for to be
the sandy crushing stones:
The marble and such like also,
appointed her for bones.
Wherefore he threw behind himself
these stones of manifold,
Which to be men immediately
(amasde he began behold.)
Of these came all the men that now
are living under sky:
And Pirrha mylde to play her part
behynd her by and by,
Began throw as many stones as this
Deucalion threw before,
Which straight became a troop of dames:
of both kinds there were store.
The reason now I guess how that
such shrewes in earth abound,
In every place among the men,
a number to be found,
Is this, the sea replet with salt,
did beat against the land,
And many stones within the same
of saltish taste did stand,
Then to ensue, when all the earth
with sea was ouerrune,
There was no land but water all
to be seen under Sun.
Decreasing yet it left such stones,
remaining on the land
As saltish were, a number sure:
perhaps to Pirrhas hand
Came one of those, and made a fem:
the salt must freat always,
Within that wight which first was made
of salted stone or clay,
Whereby to choler it prouokes
and her in rage to fall
In frantike wise: a shrewe to be
such one we always call.
For such was Morrell slain,
and laid in saltish bryne,
For saltish shrewes his skyn was flayne
such shrewes in it to shryne.
Offaithfull friendship.
When worldly wealth does vade and decay,
And erthly riches to earth do turn again
Yet freendship most steadfast and sure for aye,
Hap what hap may does still remain.
May any man find the like of Carrion
And Menalip companions aye,
Who to the death were friends? no not one,
Who kept this friendship most stedfest in stay,
There are friends dead, and of sorts twain,
By proving a man may find it true,
The one in countnance all for gain,
The others words dead to ensue.
Some men remember Pylades,
A faithful man, a trusty wight,
Oh sacred friend unto Orestes,
Oh sparkling star to give us light:
They all are gone and laid in grave,
Once we had Pilades, and once Orestes,
But them again or like, we none shall have,
Ne have not now, to trace their progress:
Menalip is gone, and Carrion,
The sacred souls has rapt them aye,
Their facts have we as yet to look upon,
Such kept the flower of freendship in stay.
What danger insueth if a man enterprise a higher place then his degree can
aspire unto.
BY fortune came a country clown
to London, for to see,
And roming up and down the streets
as best he thought to be,
Went to the court a place unmeet
for such a carter plain,
The same time where for princes sport
great pastime to ordain
Men went about: the night drew on,
and Luna with her horns,
The azure sky and element
with sparkling stars adornes.
And he thus learned of the boys
or lackeys of the court,
Such passing pleasure for to be,
and eke such princely sport,
Did mind (if that he might) to get
and wring into the hall
To take the vewe, this beyish clown
did nothing are appall,
Though with the sight of nobles store
his dollish eyes were fed,
But loppreth to the upper end,
his cap upon his head.
One of the wayters seeing this,
him by the arm can hold,
And said sirrah, to come so nygh
how dare thou be bold?
Come on, if that thou list to view
and see some pleasant sight,
Go get thee out into the street
and stare on the moon light.
But he with strugglyng began refuse,
and very long resist,
Till at the length his ear did fetch
somewhat at porters fist.
(I know not what it was) but he
with anger chafed much,
Did think if he were at the door
to recompense this tuch,
So that in deed (that place attain)
unawares to any wight,
He gave the porter another blow,
with all his power and might.
The fellows seeing this, began run
on heaps unto the door,
And for one blow they did him give
whole twenty, yea and more,
In so much that the foolish sot
was forced almost to cry,
When as he felt a weighty fist
to hit him on the eye.
They laid on load, but at the last
he escaped from the door,
Thinking aye to go so far,
he venture would no more,
But to beware by this, since that
so foolishly he would.
Now venture in a place to high
for his decree so cold.
This chance does often hap to such
as boldly do aspire
To highest top as they are led
by foolish fond desire:
Its often seen, that they which sit
at meat at the upper end,
Are often placed all below,
and lowest thither send.
Let every man him hold content,
and aye well pleased be,
In each point, with such haps as are
most meet for his degree.
Of parents deformed having a beutifull child.
DOubling doubts and musings much I stand
To see dame natures fact, by skillful hand,
I muse how that the tree that bears by kind,
The red hawe, should to chestnuts be in clynde:
I muse how that yt tree should change that suit
For grapes most pure his cat sloes sour fruit
This change seems somewhat strange in deed to me
Such kindly gripes unkindly for to be.
I muse how that dame nature could with skill,
And learning large of high Pernassus hill,
Frame such a piece on earth here for to stray
Of parents as were made of clodded clay.
I muse how that erst such a froward fyr
With drowsy wife whose love is to the fire,
Should get a daughter damsel fair and bright,
For to display dame beauties banner bright.
This fact departs by fame the only deed,
Of thundering love, yt gives yt good their meed
To rest with him, and pai^s the ill their hire.
For to descead to hell and flaming fire.
Of him that took a quart of wine when it was proffered by his friend, who
minded to get a pottell.
ONe newly come to town, of friends
a number he began meet,
About the rest, by freendly talk
one chiefly thus him greet,
Unto your welcome sir I have,
some where a quart of wine,
Which willingly I would bestow
on you this present time.
Mary (quoth the other) gladly
your gentle gift I take,
The quart of wine I mean not now
with nay thus to forsake.
Nay quoth the other straight, you ought
for to have offered me,
A pottell more for to requite
my gift offered to thee:
For courtesy does will when that
one offreth thee a quart,
Thou should him give the like or more,
to show thy gentle heart.
Beshrew me then (quoth the stranger)
for (...) thou drinkst of mine,
I will be sure before band aye,
to have a taste of thine.
For many men most mindfully,
do often offer make,
Such things as they ne willingly,
would any time forsake.
But for a skill to get the like
under color and face
Of courtesy where crabbed claws
deceitfully do trace,
So now this quart of wine
is offered aye of thee,
To the intent that thou might get
a pottell more of me.
To her the Lover writes, being familiarlie acquainted, refused in presence to
speak to him.
Since that thy favor once I held
and ioyed part thy grace,
What was the cause, that this disdain
should brge himself a place
In thee? at home I know,
and eke remember well:
Full loving tales and stories there
I often could thee tell,
And for reward I could receive
of thee a kiss or twain,
As justly aye deserude of me:
in recompense of pain.
I then was bold to go with thee,
in chambers low and hie,
And in mine arms on bed of down
have thee thereou to lie,
Though I restrained by forced fear
would never enterprise
To taste of Venus sports, as things
ne to be seen with eyes.
Where as perhaps (as well appeard)
you willing were thereto,
But that a doubt came in the wind
that forced a friend a foe.
This token you remember well,
if that you list to yield.
She took a blow below the ear,
at Mooregate by the field.
To play at cards and tables both,
to drive the time away,
And other games you could devise,
as time serude day by day.
An hundred toys were to be found,
that might us merry make,
Then had the Moon clean lost her form,
and was ne like a cake,
I was thy darling then, also
I did possess thy heart:
Each word that stubbornly was cast
did cause each other smart.
Why now, what is the cause me tell,
that this so vile disdain,
Should thee. enforce ne to regard
him that for thee bydes pain?
What was the cause that when you met
me with your fellows mo,
And troop of dames in open street,
you would so slyly go.
And look awry as though not meet
I were to see your face?
(Such friends as we are aye before)
this was a changed case.
But go thy way, to choose thy feere,
even where it likes thee best,
I Will trouble thee from hence no more,
ne thee disturb of rest.
But as long as by sight I know,
a woman from a sheep,
For thy sake I will then bewart,
and look before I leap.
Of Unthrifts.
THose men whose minds are wolly bent
and set on pleasure vain,
Do take no care to get the thrift,
that brings incessant gain.
Of Whoredom.
AS aye amongst th'vntamed beasts
that range amid the wood,
Thrre is no greater rave nor than
the Wolf of cruel mood.
And as the Puttoke does surpass
each winged foul perdy,
By egernesse to skirre her pray,
once seen with greedy eye:
So aye excelles this monstrous vice
of whoredom by her kind,
Each other vice stupendous
by Satan left behind.
Like will to like.
EVen as good men rejoice always
With good men for to be,
In company to joy with them:
so like it is to see,
Ill men rejoice with like to have
their company always:
The good with like, the ill with ill,
do join in all assayes.
Of vnwittie spending.
ME think such wights, small wit in head retain,
Which do consume and spend that worldly gain
Which they have got with swet of browe and pain
no cause therefore:
Such treasure the^ as they for long have soght
In little time for to consume to naught,
Such spendyng ay not taking any thought,
makes rich men poor.
Perit quicquid feceris ingrato.
AMongst such deeds, as when that they are done
Enforce a man for to repent therefore,
This one thing chief remains for each to shun,
Though there abou^d by knowledge many more,
What ever thing thou do with zealous mind,
T'a churlish wight yt adage shows such sense,
Its lost: he will not leave his doggish kind,
Ne never mean the same to recompense.
The property of Reprobates.
BY kind they that are lewd in deed,
do joy in heart always,
When as the good misfortune find
and fall into decay.
A good man.
PErforce a perfect wight in deed,
to be, he bears the fame,
Which no man harms ne does delight,
his neighbor for to blame:
Then it insewes, if he be good,
we should him follow still,
Since we are taught to love the good
and to abhor the ill.
And if that virtue ought to be
imbrast of every wight.
Then ought we all embrace that man
that virtuous is and right.
A perfect preservative for health.
FOr keeping of a man in health
there is no better way,
Than for to eat and drink by mean,
one mean to keep always,
And ne surpass or change that mean
at one time more or less,
For measure brings a treasure tried
in pleasure or distress.
A stupendous desire.
SOme men there are that do employ
and fix their greedy mind,
To gather riches to themselves,
to private gain inclynde:
And though they find no end of wealth,
yet more they do desire,
And kindle up upon their heads,
a flashing flaine of fire.
Old men.
AL living wyghts whom that
old Senex staff has smit,
Denies youthful slothfulness,
and otherwise delight.
Diversity of remembrance.
WE all are wont (as well is known)
to prynt and bear in mind,
A lesson touching naughtiness,
to which vice is inclinde,
More sooner than a godly phrase:
so great diuersicie
Of good and ill, we always find
fixed in our memory.
The deceites of the Fox.
FOr to have learnde the Foxes wiles,
and rightly understand,
Were readiest mean them to prevent
before they come to hand.
Of a woman's hatred.
THe anger of a shrew is aye,
more grievous to some wight,
Then is the sting of serpent strong,
that brings mickle spite.
Of boasting and bragging.
HE that does little thing perform,
yet bragges at every house:
May be compared to an hill,
that once brought forth a Mouse.
A sign of anger.
IF that he bends the br^wes
in frowning wise to lowre,
We say that he then angry is,
or has an angry shower,
The sudden falling into danger:
NO wight there is that steppeth forth
or traceth on the ball,
That can from danger him exempt,
so soon as in it fall.
The pity of Dormice.
OF pity this is a sign.
And cond(...)e aye for to be known.
How that young Oormice always seed,
Their syers that in age are grown.
And when that they ne able are,
To travail for their pray,
The young ones yet the same will get,
And bring to rest always.
Of imdietie of children.
Who can deny but virtue all
is vanished out of place,
When as the children ne obey
the fathers in no case.
The sins of Kings.
When ever as the king does sin,
and justly love therefore,
Does vengeance give, to the intent
that he should sin no more:
We always see the plague to light,
on commons many a one,
As well as on the wight that sinde
and forces them to groan.
Of eating of eggs:
AT meat there met both he and she,
among those dishes rare
That there were set (not dainty though)
came eggs t'augment the fare,
(Quoth she) if that you eat this egg,
the proverb does ensue,
Three shames therewith incontinent
shall happen unto you.
But he applying this egg,
not printing that in mind:
There fell a drop, there is one (quoth she)
the other be behind.
With that he clapped the egg into
his mouth, the shelles and all,
There Is two (quothshe) watched for the third,
till that it does befall.
To him that was angry because the Cuckoo did sing before his door.
Friend rage not with the Cuckoo,
though he sings before thy door,
And Cuckoo cry, ne changing aye,
the tune he sang before.
He cries not Cuckold, though much like,
thy wife do thou not blame,
For though thou think he Cuckold cries,
perhaps it is not thy name.
Of Sugar and Salt.
SVgar and Salt begin with like letter,
though sugar be good, yet salt is better:
This sugar is sweet in mouth to the taste,
yet does the Scripture show us at the last,
That salt does season all things that there be,
and no such mention of sugar we see.
Of hasty wiuing.
HE does desire a wife in deed,
and thinks it very sweet,
That willingly would marry aye,
each harlot he does meet.
Of despising of the poor.
THough that he fallen be in decay,
and wants to maintain,
Yet it is not a godly point
to scorn the wight in pain.
Of harlots.
AN harlot sure in outward show
professes fervent love,
But from her heart she does expel
and faithful love remove.
But certain she is craving still,
and greedy of thy gold,
And without that or such like gifts,
no more touch they will hold.
As long as thou do fill her hand
with money, they remain
Thine own: but they are gone when that
they have no hope of gain.
Of keeping company with naughtipacks.
HE that does cling to fellowship
of naughtipacks always.
Its marvel if he with their blots,
himself ne spotteth aye.
The Proverb.
IN age he hardly shall enjoy,
or riches store obtain
That could ne find in heart in youth
to give himself to pain.
Of anger without a cause.
HE that does freat for each light cause,
or trifle in respect,
May well be calde a fool by kind,
his folly to reject.
Of husbandry and Scholars.
SVch as do toil to till the land,
and husbandry maintain:
Such as do plowe and cart, abide
ten times more grievous pain,
Than such as do endeavor aye
and learning sweet desire,
And give themselves by pleasant trade
sweet letters to aspire.
Another Proverb.
HE seems unwise that does intend
the top of house to raise,
Before that he has cast the sloore
to bear the heavy paise.
The error of the wicked.
AS the Egles do contemn
at beetles for to smite,
So rich men do, to scorn the poor,
inheart ofttimes delight.
Of pleading where a man's not heard.
IT better were that every wight
should hold his peace always,
Than for to speak and waste his wind
not being heard for aye:
Yea where the people ne esteem
his words, but count as vain,
There were he better hold his peace,
and take no wilful pain.
The frailnesse of youth.
YOuthly age is bent so much
to foolish fond aspect,
That if the masters will not once
with tongue their faults detect.
Another time, the worser mad
you shall them surely find,
If that it happen so, that
correction be blind.
Nothing is hid from God.
What sin soever thou commit
if it be great or small,
If it be in most secret place,
yet God beholds all.
Of flattery and lieng.
Flattery bears a skill with it,
But lying comes by mother wit.
A faithful friend.
DOutlesse a friend he is in deed,
and ought to be accounted sure,
Which shows himself a friend unto
his friend, as long as life endure.
Of costly apparel.
EXtreme folly it seems to be
attyred in such wise,
To which thy base state and degree
by much ne may arise.
Of Neighborly aid.
LEt it ne grievous seem to thee,
thy neighbor to relieve,
Since he, if thou should meet with need
the like to thee may geeue.
Of good counsel.
GOod council see that thou obey
at first when thou begin,
Ne in such hazard do thou slide,
and suddenly fall in:
From which thou may not easily pull
or draw thy foot again,
And thus repent when its too late,
increasing still thy pain.
Of him that would sight at home, and no where else.
With me ne would thou strive,
ne yet division make,
But at home on thine own dunghill,
where all cocks proudly crake.
Of a covetous mind.
SO sparing he is still, and hard
of that he does recleame,
That easier it is for to get
or draw a water stream
Out of a Flint, then for to wring
a penie from his bag
Where thousands lie, his best coat yet
is but a rotten ragge.
The Proverb.
IN brave attire who pampreth up
his corpse for seemly sight,
In velvet, purple, and such like,
his purse then ways most light.
Of wicked children.
THe child that does account,
and thinks ought for aye:
His Parents worthy ne to be
to whom he should obaye,
Most meet is to be expelde,
out from the christ: n flock,
Least graffes we should have more to grow
out of such wicked stock.
Of vvailing for the dead.
What profits to wail the dead,
and strike my self with pain,
A man may weep til heart strings break,
yet have not them again.
Of parents.
IT is not parents wit by right,
so much the child to hate,
Rather to see him cast away
than roughly him to rate.
Of such as had rather have harlots than wives
BY wit I ne allow the use
ne council of that wight
Which rather would frequent the house
of harlots day and night.
Then chastely for to take a wife,
and Himeneus please:
And rather would sustain still strife,
than always live at ease.
Of him that esteems riches more than friendship.
Unworthy he of friendship is,
that more esteems gold
Than faithful friendship, which as long
as very li^e does hold.
Of Destiny.
NO destiny a man may escape,
as reason does allowe^
And hanging is a destiny,
as many men do know:
Then i^ a wight does throw himself
amyd the ^urging ^ea,
In mind thereby to meet with death,
and drowning him to slay:
Yea though he sight in skirmige dure,
and braul with such as be
Surpassing him by manly force,
yet thus much do we see:
Though many ways for death he seek
himself away to cast.
If hanging be his destiny,
he hang shall at the last.
