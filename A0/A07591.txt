Wilhelmi Bedwelli rigonum Architectonicum: THE CARPENTARS RVLE, Explaned,
reformed, and enlarged: That is, A Table serving for the more exact, and speedy
measuring of Board, Glass, Stone, and such like, both Plains and Solids, by
the Foot, then ever heretofore has in this kind, been set out or taught by
any: Invented, and first published in the year 1612, by Wilhelm Bedwell,
Parson of S. Ethelburghs London.
Of the use of the Trigon in measuring of Plains by the foot.
TO measure by this Table, is, by two numbers known, to find the third
unknown. Things here to be measured, are magnitudes. And magnitudes or
bignesses, are quantities which have either one or more dimensions, to wit,
length, breadth, or thickness. These dimensions are here represented by
numbers. Of the two numbers assigned, the one must be sought amongst those on
the out side of the Trigon: The other amongst those underneath the base of the
same. The numbers, as you see, do stand against the spaces enclosed between
two parallel lines. Having found your numbers given, let your eye direct you
through the opposite spaces against which they stand, from the one ascending;
from the other sidewaies, or contrarily, until you observe both the spaces to
meet, or fall into one. The number there found, is the dimension sought.
Plains are magnitudes long and broad: Or, Surfaces are magnitudes of two
dimensions, namely, length and breadth. Here the two numbers given, are that of
the breadth, and the number of 12; 1 A Board of 18 inches broad, and 24 foot
long, is to be measured. Here the breadth 18 taken amongst those under the
base, and 12 amongst those on the side, do in the quadrate where their spaces
meet, give 8 inches for the length desired. Now because 8 inches is contained
in 84 foot 36 times* therefore the board given, does contain 36 foot of plain
measure. 2 A pane of Glass is 8 inches broad. Here 8 taken amongst those on
the side; and 12 underneath the base, do set us out 18 inches for the length.
If the breadth be greater then 24, that is, then any number enclosing the
Trigon, then take the half, one third part, one quarter, etc. and the number
found shall be two, three, or four foot, etc of plain measure. 3 A Table of
one yard and a quarter (or 45 inches) broad is to be measured. Here 45 inches
is greater then any number about the Trigon; therefore I take 15 the third part
of the breadth, and 15 and 12 I find to point to 9 and 3/5 for the length
desired. Therefore I auerre, that every 9 inches, and 3/5 parts of an inch in
length of that table, shall contain 3 foot of plain measure. 4 A room of 16
foot broad, and 48 foot long is to be floored; I would know how many foot of
Board it will ask to cover it. Here 16 foot, that is, 196 inches is greater
then any about the Trigon; therefore I take 16 the 12 part thereof: and 16 and
12 do allow 9 inches for the length. Now because 9 inches are contained in 48
foot 64 times; and 64 times 12 are 768. Therefore I say, the floor will
require 768 foot of board to cover it.

The use of the Trigon in the measuring of Solids by the fo^^.
SOlids or bodies have three dimensions, to wit, length, breadth, and
thick^^^e. And of these commonly the breadth and thickness are given; the
length is so^^ 1 A square timber stick of 12 inches broad, and 12 inches thick,
is to be ^^asured. Here 12 and 12 do point out 12 inches for the length
desired. 2 ^ ^one is 18 inches broad, and 16 thick. Here I find 6 inches for
the length ^^ght. If either one or both of numbers given, be greater then any
about the Trigon, ta^^s before, either the one half, one third, and the number
found shall answer in a pr^^tion, as before. 3 Suppose a stone were 4 foot (or
48 inches) over, and 8 in^^ thick. Here 24 the half of 48, and 8, do assign
9 inches for the leng^^ desired. Therefore say, that every 9 inches in length
of that stone, shall ^^eine 2 foot of solid measure. 4 Admit the stone were a
yard square, that is, (...) inches broad, and 36 inches thick. Here both the
dimensions, to wit, be^^ ^readth and thickness, are greater then any of those
about the Trigon. ^^^^efore I take 18 and 18, the half of each; and I find
them to meet in the (...) where you have 5 inches and 1/3. Therefore I say,
that every 5 inches, and (...) of an inch does contain 4 foot of stone.

To measure by that our Rular, being by the crossing of two lines given, to
find out the third; And the eye not able in many cases precisely to discern
at what parts of an inch that crossing is; some have desired that these
several meetings might be noted on the verge of the Rular, either above or
beneath; but the being not to be done without confusion, I do advise them to
have recourse to this our Table, where they shall receive satisfaction: And
withal it shall teach them how to do it. Other uses of this our Trigon,
shall, God willing, shortly be declared: for this straightness of room will
admit of no long discourse. Vale.
