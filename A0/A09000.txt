HISTORIOLA, A little storne of the acts and life of Matthew now / Archbishop
of Canterb.
Now since we have declared many things which we thought specially worthy
of rehersall concerning thestate off corpus Christi coll. and the acts of
certain masters thereof* it remains that we draw out the narratio^ a little
longer for the fore said Matthew Parker his sake of whom we have hitherto spoken
those things which he only did for the amplyfying and commodity off the said
college off the which he was master. But his praise was not shut up only
within those walls / but he being called from thence to other functions in the
common wealth / at the last did bear the highest office of the
Ecclesiastical ministry. for he was the archbischoppe of Canterburye
Therefore in his history (because his fame was more renowned then any of the
masters of whom we have made mention) we will stay a little longer / and
repeat the course of his life even from his cradell. He was borne in that
famous city of theaft Angles which is called Norwitche in the year of the
incarnation of our lord a thousand five hundredth four / the sixth day of the
month of August / of honest parents citezens / his father called william / and
his mother Alice / who caused his childhode to be instructed in thelements of
grammar (as the coustome was then in the city to frame the wits of children)
within their own house till he was xviij. years old. At wihich time being
Past his Childhode / his mother riddeth him of her house / his father being
dead / and sent him to Cambridge / to thentent that the foundation of learning
being already laid by the knowledge of grammar / he might finishe the rest of
the building in lerning the arts. Therefore in corpus Christi coll. he was
sustained at the first / wholly by his mothers charges / of the which after a
few months she being eased / he was chosen into the number of those scollers
which are called bibleclarkes of the especial duetye which they execute. He
traueiled in logic and Philosoph^e first in S^ Mary's hostell / the title and
government wheroff partained then to corpus Christi coll. until it ceased to
be an house of learning for scholars. In these kinds of study when he had
spent three years and a little more / before the fourth was fully complete / he
was made bachelor of art / and three years after that master off Art and
fellow besides off corpus coll. being first e^tred in all the rites of Poope
holy.
holy orders. But now he being very well and perfectly instructed in the
libera^l sciences / As the course of his liffe has declared. for he got
thereby a benefice or two.
he applied all his mind to the study of divinity / and to the readinge of
the volu^es of th'ecclesiasticall fathers / and that so earnestlye / that in
short space of time he bestowed his labor not vnprofitablye in this behalf.
for after the space of four or five years he issuing from his secret and
solitary study into open practice in the common welthe preached every He

cities and places of this realm, by the authority of king Henry the viij. by
whose lettres patentes this was granted unto hi^ together with the license of
the. Archb. of Canterbury. In executing of this fu^ctio^ of preaching he gained
this commodity / that the fame of him came unto the ears of king Henry.
whervppon he being called into the kings court / was there / first made
chapleyne to Queen Anne while she lived / afterward to king Henry the viij.
and last off all to Edward the vj. when he Ruled the common wealth. All which
princes bestowed on him very large / and plentiful Rewards for his diligence.
for by favor off Queen Anne / he was made Charges liuinges enoughe for one
man. But he showed betymes, what game he loved. Paul sayethe they seek there

Henrye / there was given unto him a Prebend off the new erection in the church

master off corpus Christi college where he had spent his youth in lerning.

had besides by the gift off the coll. where he was master / what is to glory

a benefice in the diocese off Elye / called Landbeache near unto Cambrydge:
further at this time he retained and safelye held the deanrye off Stoke /
against all the importunate suit and complaints off diverse that labored for it
/ until the first year off Edward the sixth / when by a statute made at that
time / he was constrained to leave that preferment / receiving notwithstanding
in recompense / a yearly sum off 40. pounds out off the kings common
treasorie. But the case was so / that at his first coming thither he was the
author off building a scoole within the coll. off Stoke / and off the apointing
a yearly stipend unto the scoolemaster / to the e^de that the youth might be
there instructed in grammar and in the whole study off humanity: whereupon by
and by there repaired thither on heaps / the sons as well off noble / as mean

either him self to forsake that goodlye compaigny off youths / or that it
should be severed and dispersed again / although that by his travail he had
provided before / that the scoole should have some assurance although weak and
unsteadfast. But co^cerni^g the promotions wherwih the bou^ty (as I have said*
off H^nrye the father / and Edward the son / had largely enriched him he
reaped off them very To (...) unto him to be prof^table unto others
pleasant fruit / until the hard and troublesome times off Queen Mari^. In
the second year off whose reign he was dispossessed off all his goods / not
enjoying any either commodity or yearly stipend. The which extreme calamity
was common unto him with almost all the Bishops off England and other
ministers off the church for many causes and points of Religion / and
especially for that one: that they had married wives / the which was lawful to
the ministers off the church by the statutes off king Edward the sixth?
established in two several parliamentes / and by the eternal word off God
above which for any mortal man to presume / it is both extreme madness
into^erable pride ^ permitteed / and specially for avoiding off whoredom
commanded by S^ Paul. for this cause therefore he being deprived off all
things which he had attained to by the bountye off his lords / he lurked
secreatlye for those years wherein Queen Marie reigned / within the house off
one off his friends leading a poor life whithout any man's aid or succor /
and yet so well contented with his lotte / that in that pleasant rest and
laisure off his study / he would never in respect off him self have desired
any other kind off life the extreme fear off danger only excepted / wherein
he lived with all good men / and tha^ not without some cause* for from the
beginning off the reign off Queen mary until the end there off very many Good
men were burned / not for murder ^ theft / whoredom / or any other crime /
But only for there manifest constancy in the Religion off Christ and there
open professing off the name off Christ against the Pope and all his
confederates. Whose death very gloriouslye to there praise will be remembered
together with the crueltye off that time off all posterity for ever. But that
saynig off the Prophet is full off comfort / that God chideth not allwaies
nether keeps his wrath for ever / and that off the Philosophers also is true
that nothing violent is perpetual. For at this time queen mary died when she
had reigned almost six years / at which time God showed his justice to all
that were afflicted / and his judgments to those which had suffered wrong /
for Elizabeth the sister off Marie / a lady off singular wisdom and mildnes
/ expelled out off her realm the bondage off Rome / restored the pure doctrine
off the gospel / licensing the people to read the scriptures / and calls
them all home into there country / which had willinglye banished themselves
before. At which time she preferre^ hi^ You shot at a Good mar^^e.
for whose praise this history is compiled to the dignity off
tharchbishoprick off Canterbury wh^^ / he a litell before had crept out off his
lurking hole into the open sight off the world with his wife whom he would not
dismiss all the time off Queen Marye / a woman very chaste and well manered
and that did greatly reverence her husband off whom he begatt three children
wheroff those two which are only alive his care is to have them instructed in
all liberal lerning / partlye in thuniuersitye / and so^etymes at home in his
house. The bear that co^eth unwillingly to the stake is willingly carried from
it.
But how vnwillinglye ^e took upon him this whither you call yt burden or
dignity off the Archbishopric / refusing yt often times when yt was proffered
/ there conscience can witness which have not least to do in the government off
the common wealth and such as are in especial favor with the Queens highness.
But when he had once taken upon him this chief cure and charge off the
Christian flock / how wisely he behaved him therein for those years that are
past / with general allowance / consent / and favor off all Good men / how
discretly also in so great diversity and dissension off judgments / how
vprighly and sincerely in other men's matters and controversies / with how great
gentilnes and patience in other men's wrath and displeasure / with what
forbearing and sufferaunce toward the evil that he might win them / with
what godliness in reconciling the stomakes off gentilmen and determining there
controversies / how loathe he was that contumeliously they should draw each
other into the law / men may easily tell how often where the nombre is but small.
lastly how often his voice was hard to sound out off the holy pulpittes / as
well off his cathedral church / as the churches off other mean towns and
villages / especially in this his old age / in his weak and crazed state off
body / in the midst off so great business / and in these contagious and
pestilent times* all these things I will leave as matters untouched / because
there are very many which without me by the view off his manners / and tried
trade off his life / are able to report these and many things moo: What greater
adversary then a man's own conscience.
But yt is impossible that I an howshold witness / occupyinge my self in the
setting forth off so great praises / should obtain credit what soever I am:
notwithstanding that I speak the truth in differently / and would not apply my
self to gain the favor off men by flattery. Therefore I will pass to the
declaration off those things / wherein I may easily avoid the infamous blemishe
off flattery / for that there are many which can witness with me / that he
deserved no small commendation because that after he had visited his diocese
through out by him self / and not by any substitute / and which was more of
his own charges / for that he Antony thought he had greatly pleasured Tully
because he killed him not unjustly.
freely remitted to all the parishes the sum^es off there procurations which
they should have pa^d him for visitinge the diocese: that noble and famous
palace off his sea off Canterbury by long continuance off time decayed / rotten
/ consumed with fire and almost laid even with the ground in all the buildinges
theroff / he reu^ed / builded ^ fully Is it time to build your seeled howses
and not time to build the house off God. Ag^.
restored and beautified yt with this fair and glorious show wherein yt now
florisheth / not feared from this enterprise either by the infinite labor and
travail / neither dissuaded by the want off necessary things which should
have been left him off his predecessors / nor by the dearth off the time nor by
the wages off the laborers which were merueiloussly increased / nor by any
other lettes or hinderan^ces / But ^at he fully finished yt in the year off
the incarnation off our lord 1564. the sixth year off the reign off Queen
Elizabeth and in the 6^. year off his age / and the fifte off his
consecration. In the which year he also endeavored to repair the quires off
those churches which were lately come into his possession / off which sort he
had very many in his diocese / partly by the exchange off ancient possessions
off the Archbishopric / made between king Henry the eight and Tho.
Archbishopp off Canterbury his predesessor / partly for an other exchange off
the possessions off the Archbishopric by a statute established for the same
purpose / in the first year off Queen Elizabeth before he obtained the Sea.
The charges off which building / besides the yearly reparations off other
howses / grew to the sum off a thousand four ^u^dreth powndes and somewhat
more. The which he did the rather Turn mine eyes from (...)*
for that / he had heard that hall off the palaice within his remembrance
singular and famous for the largenes theroff / to have been honored in the
year off our salvation 1519. by the presence as well off Charles the fifft
emperor / as off Henry the eight king off that name / with his wife Katherine
whom the Emperor came then to see being his aunt. This hall those princes then
occupied with all the troop off there guard and retinue / so that for all the
princes affairs / for triumphs and feasts the upper part theroff was
appointed for the Emperor Charles / and the nether part for Henry the King. But
the chefest cause that he coueted to preserve the magnificence off that hall
was / for the memory off the coronation off kings and Queens very offten
times celebrated in that place / and the installinge off Archbishopps his
predecessors (which they commonly call inthronization) to whose sumptuous
feasts there has been very great resort as well off lords / as gentilmen /
with an infinite troup of others to celebrate and honor that feast with there
presence. At which feast in his predecessors times / certain with much adoo
the king was excepted from the Archbishops service.
dukes and earls were high stewardes by custom / receivinge an yearly pension
and a reward ^it for so great personages: as off late the duke off Bukingha^ in
the inthronization off william warham Archbishopp / in the year off our lord
1504. The which solemnity though the foresaid Matthew used not at his entrance
to the Archbishoprik (as also did not Reginald Pole Cardinal his next
predecessor / and some other off those that were before him / partly because
they were not able / partly for that the revenues off the Archbishopric were
much diminished / if comparison be made with the former times) yet remembering
that his forefathers in buildinge a place so large and stately / had no other
respect or consideration but feastinge and hospitality / A worthy study for a
bishopp might ^e not well have said o quanta patimur?
he deuiseth by him self by what means he might best enterteine / with this
kind off courtesy in sumptuous feasting a multitude sufficient for that place /
both of the communalty / and off the great estates off Kent. For this purpose
therefore he takes the opportunity off time in this sort. In the year off
Christ 1565. which was the next year after the restoringe off the hall / he
prepared a feast very magnifically and sumptuoussly / where unto when they
flocked from every place in great companies / he placed them al at diverse
tables through out the hall / which was garnished with tapistery and other
things very comely and beautiful / brought out off flaunders and Holland. and
because he would want no guestes / he provided that the judges (which by an usual
term are called in that place Iorneyinge / and then only at Canterbury and no
where else kept there judicial sessions) sshould repair thither. At the which
time also he badd al them to this feast which were gathered together out off
the whole province / for the trial of the law / as well gentilmen as mean
persons. At that time there sat as judges / master John Southcotes / one off
those judges whose authority is to hear men's pleas and controversies in the
common place: and Gilbert Gerard esquier general attorney off the Queens
highness / which together with Tho: Kemp Knight that year Sheriff / and with
all there train were present at the feast off the Archbishop. which feast how
bou^tifull it was in daintiekates / how well and orderly all things were
served by the Archbishops howshold / how well this his courtesy was accepted /
how ofte^tymes the tables in the hall were freshly furnished with new guestes
the sa^e day / I coue^ing to be short will not here declare / but I leave it to
the memory off those which then were present out off the whole co^ntrye. And
whose God is there belly. Phil. 3.19.
this courtesy in feasting was not at that time only showed by that occasion
but before also he used in the same hall the like solemnitye at other times:
partly at whitsontide the Archbishopp him self both preaching and celebratinge
the holy communion / first in the cathedral church / at which time the
prebendaries off the church / and the Mayor off the city with his brethren /
and others inferior citizens together with many gentilmen off that contrie
bringing him home / dined in the same hall / the places being so ordered / that
the Archbishopp sat in the midst off the high table / on his left hand the
mayor and all the other men as every man excelled in dignity and countenance
/ and so on one side off the hall a continual row of me^ followed to other
tables / set in order and severed by a little space between / through out the
lenght off the hall. On his right hand sat only some noble women and the
honorable wives off other men / leading from every side off his table a course
and right line of woomen through out the length off the hall altogether like
and correspondent to that row off men wheroff we spoke before The which order
off placing was observed in honor of the Quee^es highness / for that under her
being governor of the realm / the said Matthew obtained his place. And this
first furnishing off tables thus ended / there were others partly off the
Arschhishops family / partly off the country there about which strait way satte
down in their places which rose / in the same order as before. And this manner
off feasting continued by the space of two days na^ely mo^day and tewesdai.
Besides this / the day off the bolye and inseparable Trinitye folowi^g (for ^e
thougt that that day ougt especally to be sole^nlye cebrated for the famous
memory off king Henrye theyght who was the last restorer off the church and
an excellent reformer off evil ceremones and customs) he spent in the like
curtesye off entertayning off guests the accustomed prayers in the cathedral
church being first finished. At which time / one off the chief ministers off
the church / made a sermon and Matthew tharchbishoppe himself / was minister
off the blessed communion and supper off our Lord unto the people / standing
in the upper end / or corner off the church. The administration off which
comfortable banquett after he had ended he went home accompanied with the whole
number and congregation off the cathedral church / which sat down to the
festival dinner the said hall / and in the same manner as before / with other
chief men both off the city and country. Again the three and twentieth day
off July folowinge / was the day off assize and publik meetinges off the Judges
/ and other off the province / either to understand / men's causes / or to
punish manifest offenders / as we have before declared the said hall was
likewise replenished / only excepted / that the guests wear only gentlemen /
and off the best off the woomen being placed at very exquisite fare / within
the inner parlors. But amongst things which happened / unto him in his life
worthi off memory. I rejoice especially for this his felicity / that whereas
after Augustine the first Archbishop / he was the seuentith / yet he was
both the first / and only man / that attained unto tharchbishoplike dignity
with out any blemishe or spott off old wives superstitions and unprofitable
ceremonies off the Romish Pope. for as every one off them entered first
herunto by buils / off approbation sent from the Pope: so he was consecrated
nether with these / nor any other old / and idell ceremonies off Aarons
orname^tes / nether with gloves / nor sandales / nor sslippers / nor miter /
nor pall / but more chastely and religioussly / according to the purity off
the gospelie / four bishops being appointed according to a law made in
that behalf which placed him in his chair with so godly promises protested
by him / as it is meet should of a gospellike pastor. And yet this his (that
I may so term it) joyful and solemn day he spent not negligentlye / but
with garments co^ly for a bishop with godly prayers / off thecclesiasticall
ministers / and peopell / unto whom a sermon was made by a learned religious
and a professed bishop in divinity / chiefly to He that knows the will off
his Master and does it not shall be beaten with many stripes.
admonish the pastor of his dewtie / and faythfullnes toward his flock / and
co^trarywise / the flock off love / obedience and reverence which they ougthe
to yield to their pastor. The sermon ended when the company prese^te / had
refreshed themselves / by partakinge the spiritual ba^quett: they make an end
with earneste prayers unto god / that that function which was laid on him /
by the clergy / migthe chiefly tend to the glory of god / to the salvation of
Christian flock / and the joyful testimony off his own conscience / by
faithful executinge of his office / when yt shall happen him to depart unto
his lord / to whom he vowed him self. And the very same solempnitie / and
manner of consecration / he used toward his brethren bishops upon whom
afterward he laid his hand / of the which this is not to be let sslipped by /
that wheare we read in histories / that so^e one off his predecessors has
consecrated unto god in one year 5.3. or 4. brethren / or at the most 6.
which the^ was thougt very strange: to him it chaunsed that in the first year
off his government / he consecrated 11. he confirmed 2. and the 2. years
followi^ge he placed in their seas the whole number of the bishops off Engela^d
(save only the bishop of La^doffe) namelye / Paul rejoiced not off those
whom he had baptized but the false Aposteles, as for him ^e saye^h you are my
glory and my joy to the. Thesalonians whom he won to the Gosp.
the first year he placed bishope in London sea Edmond Gryndall / in Elye
Richard Cocks / in worcester Edwine Sands / in Bangor Rouland Meri^k / in
Lincoln Nycolas Bullingha^ / in Salisburye John Ieuell / in S. Dauides /
Thomas young / in S. Asaph Richard David / in Rochester Edmond / Gest / in
Bathe and we^les Gilbert Barkley / at Lichfeld and Couentree John Benram. And
in the same year he confirmed william Barlowe sometimes bishope of Bathe and
wells in chichester and John Scorie before bispope off chichester in Herforde:
And in the second year next follownge he created william Alley bishope off
Exceter / John Parkhurst off Norwich / Robart Horn off winchester / Edmund
Scamler off Peterboroughe Thomas David off Saint Asaphe / and Richard Cheyney
off Gloucester. Besides that / the same year he confirmed Archbishop off york
/ Thomas young / transslated from Saint Dauides / and confirmed also Thomas
David bishope off Saint Dauides / translated from Saint Asaphe. And in the
year off our Lord 1564. when Antonie bishop off Landoffe died (who only
remained in his sea / and agreed to the religion / whearas the other bishopes
created in the time off Queen Marie / withelde there consent from the Religion
established in the general assembly off all estates and orders / whearat they

to profess the received Religion should be deprived off their authority /

many off the eccesiasticall order / so wear there as many which retained their
dignities and places / professing with us the restored religion by A publik
oath ministered unto them) in the rome off him being dead / he consecrated in
the year of our Lord 1565. Hughe Dauides Doctor off Law. And in the year
1566. he consecrated Nicolas Robinson Doctor off divinity into the bishoprike
off Bangor / and in the year 1567. he confirmed Henry Curwin Doctor off Law in
the bishoprike off Oxforde. The which pastores and fathers / although
diuersslye professed in the Scoles off universities / yet all wear / so well
learned / that they knew how to distribute the lively word off the
scriptures to the people off God / with due respect off time place and person
the which every one off them very often or rather continually does in the
cures committed unto them the testimony wheroff. Aes you have set your bias

But that we may speak sumwhate off his manners and life / off whom we
presently entreat / I can say thus much that he was so thriftye an husband

tharchbishopricke / that by his prudent sparinge the rentes suffized for those
great charges / which he was at by reason off his first fruits / and subsidies

the begininge off his gouermente / for the provision of household stuff / and
inplementes / and by reason off hospitality. And yet he so liberally ordered
the fruits / which he reaped / and received off his Archiepiscopall dignity /
that withwhome soever he del^e / in byinge necessary things for the use off
his family / either wecklye he ^e^dered their money unto them / or at the most

care through ought his whole life / was that in every estate off life / he
might live from day to day with A good testimony off conscience / before god

whearin he wisely considered both the sshortnes off ma^s life / and the

to his servants / is greater then off any his predecessors. He also often

singular learning / and authority (whom our most noble Queen Elizabeth
appointed to be one off the Masters off the requests / and Matthew him self
hadd made him chief Judge off his prerogative court) very finely alluded in
these verses.

The Keys of ancient parents tokens are.
From sovereign prince does come the tripell starr.
So virtue, learning, power, conspire best,
And sow the pleasant seeds, of quiet rest
But yet the joys of life to end do have,
And man but dust before, to dust shall wast.
Whearupon / as he aknowledgeth the Keys to perteyne unto him by the law off

him / by reason off his spiriatuall function / which is wisely to open and
shutt the Kingdom off heaven to the Christian congregation / in the which
meaning / the Keys wear delivered unto Peter / and to all that execute that
spiritual office in church of preachinge the gospel.

But whearas we see the keye thrice in his arms / that has respect to Peter's

tharchbishope has three keys because Christ said pas^^, pas^^ Nay rather
because he locketh up the Kingdom of heaven so fast by holdinge out of

Lastly the stars represent that off Danyell: The learned shall shine as the
brightness off the firmament / and they which instruct many in the way off
righteousness as stars for ever and ever.

As therefore the stars bring him into the remembrance off his spiritual
authority / and office / so also by the starr / he learneth to remember what
is required of him / that by the pureness off his light / he should shine to
other / and by the heavenly doctrine off the word / should bring again into
the light the congregation off Christ / which now a great while has
miserably lain hidden / and overwhelmed in gross darkness / by the traditions
off men. And that he might not altogether forgett himself (as theye are wont
to do which are set up aloft in the ^yest rooms off the world) he was
wont to rub his mind / with the memory off that sentence / that all fame /
aestimation / honor / all magistratshippes / be theye off never so ample
authority / all titles and names how glorious soever theye seem in the eyes
off men for a time / yett at the last / as the whole world it self / and all
brittle and transitorye things / theye shall perish / and decay. And in this
sort reasoninge with him self / he passed by all the entis^^ents / off the
world nether stayed at them / as at the rocks off the Syrenes. Therefore
agreinge unto Paul / that he hadd not here an abidinge city / according to
his meaning / he sought that which was to come. The which as it has in it
self / the greatest certaintye / and safetye / so this life is unconstant and
corruptible / for as much as all flesh is grass / and all the glory off man
is as the flouer off the grass / which quicklye is cut down and withers.
In the which frail / and transitorye life / he was carried forward with a
continual desiere / to profit the church off god / for that he thought / he
could not bestow his labor better on any thing (consideringe the place
wh^^h he occupied) the^ in the busy searchi off the opinion off Doctores off
his time and conferringe them with the writers off all ages. Besides he was
very careful / and not without some charges / to seek out the monume^tes /
off foremer times / to know the religion off thancient fatheres / and those
especially which were / off the English church. Therefore in seekinge up the
cronicles off the Brittones and Inglishe Saxons / which lay hidden every
wheare contemned and buried in forgetfullnes / and throwgh the ignorance off
the Languages not well understood / his owen especially / and his men's
diligence wanted not.

And to the end / that these antiquities might last long / and be carefullye
kept ^ he caused them / being brought into one place to be well bound and
trymly covered. And yet not so contented / he deuored to set out in printe /
certain off those aunciente monumentes / whearoff he knew very few examples
to be extante / and which he thought would be most profitable for the
posterytye / to instruct them / in the fay the and religion off the elders.

Here upon / he caused the perpetual histories off the inglishe affairs / by
Mathaeus Paris^ensis once a Monk off Saint A^banes / and Mathaeus Florilegus
/ a Monk off Saint Peter's in westminster / written in latin / to be printed /
after he had diligently conferred them with thexamples* / which he could get
in any place / to the end / that as sincerelye as might be / as thauthors
first left them / he might deliver them into men's hands.

Lastly that he might not be unmindful off those monumentes which both in
antiquitye / worthiness / and authority excelled all other / or rather wheare
with none are to be compared (I mean the holy scriptures) here be thougthe to
do great good / if by his number / he increased the holy Bibles / which
shortli would be wantinge unto many Churches / ^ff this discommoditye wear
not provided for in time. Therefore it seemed good unto him first with his
learned servants to examine thorowghlye thinglishe translation / whearin he
partlye used the help off his brethren Bishops / and other Doctores / with
whom he delte so diligently in this matter / that theye disdained not to be
parteners and fellows with him off his labor.

But it happened unto him / when he saw the happy finishinge / and end of

To the Cbristian reader / peace in Christ / and war with Antechriste.
IF upon the tomb off that Assyrian Queen of Babylon / in stead off that
description (Hear lies hyd great treasure) there had been graven in golden

yt had been no such sacrilidge / for Darius to have ransacked the dead woman's
grave: nor he himself so worthelye noted off foul coueteousnes / that would
violate such sacred places / thorough a most unholy hunger off gold.

But rather yt had turned all the contrary to his praise / who even in the
earth / and a monge dead men / would have fought / and dug for such a mine

taking pleasure in prouokinge any man / by false promyses to rake in her ashes.

But this Queen was a woman / a heathen / and a stranger from god / yea without
god / and there withal had no meaning to deceive / for hurt / but only to
chastise such extreme avarice / and to teach their by / and make more

unclean and filthy.

The title / as it is said / De antiquitate, and caetera. Only a few things
are said for preface / towchinge the first preaching off Christ in this our
Island: but the whole body off the book is / bumbasted with the swellinge

shufflinge together as if h^s method had been Take yt among you) so there is
no such chaste dealinge / as wear to be wished. For many bastard tales / off

And because yt might not seem to be placed there lyghlye / nor without the

established by such coniuringe witches / and coleprophetes / seduced by the

The tree off this succession norished with the sape off the crabstocke whearon
it was unhappily graffed / not unlike to the manner off conquerers / and tyrans
/ sought by all means to advance / and enlarge this there newlye won
domination. For they devoured up quite an Archbischoprike off wales and
drowned it in the botomlesse sea off Canterbury. Somewhat they strained at the
vnderbishoprikes / there making a conscience to swallowe such gnates / and
therefore off there great Good grace / were content they should not utterly lose
their being / but remain to increase the number off there subjects. By which
shamfull struglinge they obtained to sit upon there fellow Archbishop off
york / and to tread upon the rest their brother bishops in England.

And having thus prevailed in England and conquered (for so he terms yt)
york / whom he could neither bear superiore with pompey nor suffer aequal
with Caesar / For he plainly chalengeth a superiority and fealty off him.
Then boasts he what a motherlie estimation it retained with the churches in
Scottland / even then / when he knows no milk was to be sucked from her /
but poison.

From Scotland he takes shippinge and popelike steps over into Ireland / and
thence over again into france / Gasconie / Normandy / Aquetaine / and there
(says he) it overcame all the churches in Jurisdiction also. If this be to
watch over one proui^ce in a realm / like an Archbishope / and not rather
aspiringlye / to affect a popedom over many realms / judge ye. It will be no
aunswear / to say that the king off England / being then sovereign off
Ireland / and france in possession / might as well apoint one Archbisshope over
all those regions / as over Ingland / or on province therein. for if the
Archbishopes nose must be so long / and that he must have such elbowe Rome /
then let us hear what the Pope / who is next above the Archbishope will say.
Surely / he will singe the very same song for him self. The emperor off Rome
sovereign over all these parts off the world / made me general Bishop
above my brethren.

But this Argument / and such like / is the principal content off those two
or three and twenty leaves / yea off that ^itle which he entreareth in those
few first leaves. De antiquitate Britannicae Ecclesi^^, the very first
chapter shows what is the chief subject. For the title off that first
chapter being / De v^tustate Britannicae Ecclesiae testimonia* the very f^rst
words being ^ractaturi de Cantuariensibus Archiepiscopis, and the last chapter
off these few leaves / a description off the town off Canterburye / who sees
not that neither in begininge / midst / nor end / he could dissemble his
meaning / and that thauncientye off thenglishe Church is but a vizard for that
wormeate^ Church of Caunterbury / to mask under / the bolder to boast her off
her lovers / and to whisper such uncleanly speeches / as she durst not have
uttered barefaced impudent though she be / and past all grace. Else durst she
not affirm / in tempore praesenti, that Archiepiscopi Cantuariens authoritas

s^d ordinary l^bera (...) per sua (...). I wee^e this passes the besides off

The process off th^s^ two or three (...) leaves is aunswerable to ^he

the man's man off the Lord suff^agane / who is the man's man off the
Archbishop. There is discoursed at large the ambitious / and tra^icall
Hie^^^^achie / between the two H^erarches off Canterburye and york / for the
papacy in England and by the way off a petye braw^e / and subquarel^ between
york / and duresme / for Archiepiscopall Jurisdiction in that province.

In all these things / is there to be noted / a marvelous carnal / and
worldly affec^ion borne to Canterburye sea. For besides you shall see diverse
very odious and proud comparisons / with the Archbishope off york / both for
the bargeines off Imperial precinct / and also For courteous usage toward
his subject Parishes. For with these names / he is content to debase his
vassel B^shoprikes. And this is a taste of the church honors / and spiritual
subjection which the sea off Ca^terburye chalengeth.

The end off that three and twentye leaf is a preface off his temporal
principalities privileges / and prerogatives / which is begone with a worthy
sentence out off John Capgra^e off Pope vrbin / who with his own vnho^ye
mouth pronounced Archbis. Austyne off Canterburye / worthy to be an other
Apostolical Bishop / and Patriarch off an other world yea almost his
fellow to the great honor (no^ doubt) off h^s successors off Canterburye. In
this par^e is it somewhat trauiled. For very substanciallye / he begins with
his diu^sion off the rigthes / and prerogatives off that sea. Some says he
are set out in the laws and be common with other Archbishoprickes ^ some are
absolute and peculiar unto him self / without al^ laws / or not expressed in
the laws. H^s rihgtes prescribed / and circumscribed in the laws are
confirmation off his provincial Bishops / which without great impiety /
may^ be done noe whea^e laufullye but in Christ's church at Canterburye.

The next is what great tr^butes every made Bishop paid him. How they
(...) his who^e ^ousho^de (...) it is very much for one brother ^ ^o (...)
off an other / for that which shou^de be bestowed fran^^lye / (...) common
wealde.

(...) fol^oweth his right off (...) Dioceses (...) other inferior Bi^^op^
(...) what theye have done^ to call synodes in the^e D^ocesse / to (...) / and
that without any (...)

And that the same Earl must be his (...) / and chief cupbearer the day off
h^s Inthro^ziation: This is (...) to be called gra^ious Lords as the Lords
off the earth are / but this is to be beyond all grace / and to be served off
these gracious Lords / and to be there Lord paramounte. In this ro^e of his
noble Tenaun^es / the next are the Lord Si^anguais / the Earl of Oxforde /
the Lord Darcye / a^l which (says he) owe service to that Archbishopp.
wheare comes in to be remembered / one v^rye regal prerogative in deed. For
it encounters hand to hand / even with The kings prerogatyue. That is / that
whearas in others common persons cases / ^ff there Tenaunte hold any land
off the King / he shall have the custodye off both on and other / the
Archbishop shall yet against the King retain the land off his infant
Tenaunte / though ^e hold of the king by knights service / or in capi^e.
which he proves by a presiden^e in the minorytye off this earl off Oxforde in
the time off the now Archbishope. Many other immunities very princlicke / are
recited both for himself / for his / and for his church. Over Rochester
Bishopric / besides that he was a superior Archbishop / he was also patron
and giver off ^t.

From this step he clymeth up an other / yet higher / that the kings off
this realm are crowned / and made by him / as that which off right / is
properly due unto him / and theruppon tells how the bishope off Salisburye
for his malepart intrudinge him self / to marie the king once / under color
that it was in Salisburie diocese / was shrewdly reproved / and to his
reproach rejected / and the Archbishope taken to do it. That the king / and
Queen be his domestical / and special parishoners / wheresoever they be in
England / yea that all England / distinct in diverse diocesses / is by reason
off his primacie / his parish.

All this is recited / not as one that tells what other say / but there are
added arguments and reasons to prove it. for says he (the author off that
book I mean) that these things be true / yt appareth because all
offringes off the king / and Queen / or other noblemen / either in the kings
chapel / or other Church cathedral / contientuall / or parochial / offered
in the presence off the Archbishop / are his own and sha^^ not (...) either
to the Bishope off the (...) no^ to the co^^ent and (...) to the deane off the
Chapel off the King / much less to the poor priest off the parish.

His second part off his subdiuisio^ / off his peculiar rightes / that is his
church superiority / and preuileges is pursued first with this Archhonor /
that the Archbishope off york with all humility requir^th to be consecrate
off him off Canterbury / and prof^ss^th (...) in the consecration off
Canterbury. The Archbishope off Ireland and (...) take their righ^^s off (...)
them selves to the seru^ce and attendance off Canterbury sea. Th^^ descends
he to the gifts / that every (...) Bishop best^weth (...) in their life /
and at their (...) / wi^h saddel (...) there ringes / and (...) seals ^ Among
the ^

^

There is not left out / so much as the privilege that he has / of dealinge
with the goods / in diverse diocesses: for which / the book says / that the
other Bishops / did strive with him / but there / says the book / did the
power off the Canterburye Archbishop shine / and show forth it self / which
will not be p^nched / with the strait laws / off an Archbishop / or
Metropolitan / which being not on ye primate off all England / says the
book / but also ordinarye / and Bishop off all England and so being first
instituted / will still / says the book / fit over them as his suffraganes.
And once again I say all this is not bare^ye repor^ed but collected to the
gereat praise off that sea / and with allowance / and without contrary censure
/ set down.

To make up all his goodly glory the (...) off this treatise / is with that
usurped power off dispensation / which the Pope held against / the laws /
off the king off Eng^ande / and against the et^rna^l law / off the king off
kinge^ Jesus Christ: and that this d^spens^nge power / is translated to
Canterburye. In the Law off which transs^ation though there be a god ye
caution / that nothing should be dispensed with / against the express will
off God / yet so unruly / is the vn^ained and unbridled Arch^^p^scopall
Iur^ssdiction / that nether Law / no^ prou^so / can provide / to keep him
under laws.

As a perfection to all these / is added his four Archiepiscopall courts or
(fora) which name I think / is therefore equinocke / to A Marke^ / and cour^e
/ because in both / a^l things are to be sold even as in Rome. These courts
are set forth / in there majesty / there Judges / Advocates / Proctors ^

Whearin truly I have so kept me / to his words almost / as if I had been his

Nether may the author off that book say that he receiteth the bare historye
/ for with all / I say again / he allows plainly off it / and even in his
transition from his said pretended preface / off the auncienty off true
religion / in this land / to his intended trety off Austen / and his fellows /
he speaks as if he wear in a matter off great earnest / that for this cause
/ he had more respect to the Authors words alleged thoroughe out that volume
off lives / then to thelegaucie off his own style / for that he would not
swerue from the truth forsothe) off the story. And besides to what end else
worte he that book / the whole purpose whearoff / is to prove thauncientie off
that sea together with the dignity off them that satt therein / as apeereth by
the title or sumes off each chapter. To prove which auncientye off the one /
and dignity off the / other these many other like popish presumptions / and
presumptuous poperies / are the best / and only arguments. Which if they
wear all gleaned / or rather mowed by handfulls / and severed a part from that
which is spoken directly and to the purpose / for thancientye off the poor
Christian church in England / there would be but a poor harvest off that
matter / which is so gaily pretended / even scarce enoughe to make a story off
two leaves.

This title therefore of antiquity of the whole body off the general
Christian church in this our English La^d is but a bare title / nothing less
me^t / then to be entreated of / but only to make his way therthoroughe to
the extolling / and hoysing up / even upon men's shoulders / that particular
member / or chapel of Canterbury. The which is more manifest in the sole^pne
legend which follows off Idolatrous Archiflamines / the which were every one
all their life long / so far as man may judge by that that is left of the^
eue^ sitting in that throne professed Baalites / and sworn Ro^anistes / except
that only most trueli gracious bishope / and blessed martyr / holy Cranmer /
and this man that now occupies the Rome. All I say except these two were
even while they sat superstitious Archsacrificers / and principal bread
worshippers.

Now I pray you what good ca^ come to the church of god by taki^ge together
out of w. of Couentrie / Simio^ of Dumelme / H. of Hu^tington / the story of
Rochester and such authe^tike writers / the wicked lives / and gross blindness
off Dunsta^ / Cu^bert / Becket / and other there fellows off later times: or
what godly estimation to the Christian church off England to have the lives of
such not me^ / but mo^sters recorded in this ti^e / as though they wear to
be reckned good workme^ in the church: Or rather is not this to uncover the
shame / and priuities of Canterbury church / to stanpe in printed letters such
a succession of Idolaters / co^iurers / cano^ized traitors / and rebels as
that sea has yielded. But if once to name then / be to much / and to bestow
that labor in peacing together the rags off their stories be a work of small
edifieng / especially for an architect / and master builder of the church of
God* what is it to recke^ up so many of there popish tales / uncontrolled /
their enthronizations / and co^secrations / there glutting feasts / and other
pompes / there mock miracles / and wicked profession^ / their deaths /
entermentes / en^o^binges / transla^ions / and shryni^ges / with a mass of
there intolerable supersticio^s deeds and sayings uncensured. What an offense
to the good Christian man / and what a feed^nge off the humor off the sick
Papiste / to see it seet sorth in tables in that book / as it wear for an
honor off this English church / to have had many Cardinals / wherewith that
siege off Canterbury / and others have been defiled.

Truly to be able to recount a catalogue / off redd cappes / bloody gowns /
golden crosses and succession off the world (for by that name are cardinals
created it) may well seem a gaie / glittering thing in the worldly wise eye:
but the wisdom off God treads them under / as childish ^oyes / and most
vnpure vanyties. The true Christian takes no pride / nor conceyt in them / but
rather bursteth out in tears / when upon such occasion he sees the p^ague
off ignorance / and heavy judgment off God upon those our fathers / and
former times / and then he sings ye praises off the mercies off our loving
God / with thanks giving / for that inestimable benefitt off knowledge / which
he bestows upon us / who yet for our sins deserve with the worste. yea if^
the heathen poet / ca^^eth it a vain vaunt off many graund fathers / and
great graundsiers / though theye were ner^uous how vnsittinge is it for him /
that sites in the arches off the English Hierarchy / professing to be a
minister off the simple gospel / off poor Jesus Christ / whose Kingdom and
glory is spiritual / thus like / a pore blind zebediste to ask he knows
not what with such a stir to make suite for the retaining off his place / to
sit on the righthande / or left hand off Jesus Christ in this world. He I
say that should be a bright light / and sauory salt to all England /
profanely to boast him off such temporal homages / and Lordshipes over other
and to esteem so glorious the show off so many proud Pontifical antecessors
/ whose only names are not clean yenough for Christian mouths.

A number off things there are fitter / for matter off nine lessons or ^ouble
f^astes / or more double / then for Christian Chronicles / or Ecclesiastical
stories / off the which though I wot well / diverse have there gentle
corrections and soft censures / yet are they generally told / so confidently
/ and without any judgment showed upon the^ / that it is great danger lest the
poor blind papist be by them made starcke blind / and obstinate / The weak
brother by the^ take a fall / and the good Christian zelously grieved / to see
such unlikely tales off Robin hoode / so impude^tly peep forth in this broad
day / which even the^ / when they cold see to do nothing without ca^dels
light at high noone / hardly durst be so hardye / as to show there balde
heads / but in monkishe Cronickels and libraries off the darcke monasteries.

Lest therefore / the sowishe papiste off England / might walter him wantonly in
this little lump / off his mirie popish trumperie / which now perhaps he
begins to think deintie / or like a dog / gredily swallow up / this
little vomited gobett off written vnuerities / from which he has been wained
now a great while (the lord god be thanked / for the blessed and happy
instrument theroff his handmaide our Queen Elizabeth / whose faith and zeal
he more and more increase / and whose holy and helthfull life / he long
prolonge) I persuade my self that this little preface / or any other more large
treatise / being specially bent against such monkishe collections / would not
only be suffered / to pass freely / without calling in or inhibicion: but
also auctorized / and not so soene seen / but allowed / that so the open
mouth off the Lewd Papist / might be stopped from slaundering these times off
the gospel / with the approving of such vngospellike lege^ds / when he shall
see this and such like publicly approved / whereby those old wives tales / are
with all earnestn^s reproved.

To set forth to the in English all that vain collection / is nether my
purpose / nor to any purpose: thou shall be left to the latin printed book /
for so much theroff as is already set forth. But because this worthy work
seems not yet licked to the lovely shape nor grown to the just number (for
the first leaf in the title promises full seuentye Archbishops / and the last
leaf performs up but sixty nine) it is like enoughe / it will not be
unpleasant unto the nor against the author / fauior off that book / if while
he busieth himself in monumentes off more edification / and matters off more
moment / some other off lower calling and less business add unto those 69. one
other story / that came to light containinge the life off this present Matthew
Archbishope / and so absolve that work / and make up even the number off 70
Archbishopes as in that latin book is only promised. It is very like (I say)
that though perhaps this devise may prevent him / for the circumstaunce off
time / and make that borne before the time which the fathir / meant should have
been borne after his death: yet in substance it will not be against his mind
/ because when he traue^leth with 70. Archbishops in the rule off his book and
when all comes to all brings forth but 60. doubiles his meaning was to
perfect that mustre off dead men with a quick pay even with the life off him
that yet sits.

And because you shall not think / that you have hear / a horses neke joined
to any other then horses body understand you. that this seuentithe came out off
the very same shop that other 69. did / perhaps it was but rough hewn / by
one of the prentises and wan^ed sum polishing by the formam. But quite to
remove from the / all suspicion off being abused with any coined or
counterfaicte merchandise / you shall be thus plaintly dealt with. The very latin
original hereoff / came from the Archbishops own hands whose conscience ca^
best inform us the truth off his own story. It was couched in such order /
as you see it / by a P^atina of his own / and domestical Chronicler for so
the text says. The copy wherout this is turned / was written by a man off
his own / I think his secretary. An other badge it has of his / that never
fails / but makes it his perfect will / and his undoubted deed / that is /
the stamp off h^s own arms / descended as he says off his ancient house /
entermaried with those off his sea / which is a supersticious pall all double
croised / or perced through / with that Archpastorall / or Archpapisticall
staff. Hearwith he marketh any thing that passes his hands / so that though
p^rhapes / he will now so renounce / and revoke it / as it shall not be his
will / after his death: yet having seal / and being by him delivered / it
must neades take effect by his life time / as his deed. And if his handwriting
/ could give any strenght unto it / that is also not wanting. for this word
(historiola) is written with his own hand / in read oker letters / upon the
browe of the book / that by this oker marking / he may know his own sheep.
and as for the translation / though perhaps tharchbishope set hi^ not a work
/ that did it yet assure thy self / it is as faithfully do^e / as he cold.
And if thou be at any time troubled / to make sense of the English in some
places / think that he was worse troubled / to make any reason off the latin
in many places. This rule is kept thoroughe out / to go as near the Latin
as may be / and if he will have it better done by some other / the translator
will not be discontented. But if you demand in very good earnest / why it is
put in print / being so fond a thing / it must be confessed eue^ in as good
earnest / that it wea^e to be wished / dead and buried / never to rise again
with 6^. off those 69 Canterbury tales / and narrations. But yet lest yt might
perhaps by many written copies / come into diverse hands / or hereafter when
matter of greater volumes is given by his life or death / be all moulden up
in one lump / and printed again together / and this added to the rest / as a
substanciall tale to make up the tale off those 70. promised tales (for so
his meaning is else would he not have set down seue^tie Archbishopes having
but 69 predecessors) perhapes this may be some good mean / either to let that
idle labor / or else to blase the credit it deserves before it e^treth into
the world. And if it be not possible / to deliver this time from the blemish
/ which is to suffer such a legend off Canterbury tales / to be printed / with
gracious countenance of the greatest church man: yet at least / this might be
done) to wipe away this blot / that shall not suffer them go vndisgraced /
and vntaxed by one off the meanest off the Laity. I shall not nead to protest
my self void off all affection toward his parson / woe privately never offended
me. and that it is only the public offense / that greueth me. which yet (if
it need) lo here Idoe / and solemptye before you / with my pen take god to
witness off my heart / that he never harmed me / in word nor deed that I wot
priuatlie. for why my lot is so low / that I dare say he knows me not / yt
is only therefore / the common ill / that may come by publishing such idell
dreams in these days / that makes me do that Idoe. The things therein
described / being in part / not all so true / and in greatest part / to to
toyishe / do suff^ciently disclose the value off it / to the wise / and that
it is no precious stone / yet lest the see^est / might happen to esteem / it
but worth ^ barlie corn / he shall have two or three marg^nall notes for the
trewer vnderstand^^g off the story.

I have hereunto set / which is more the^ I thought to have done / at the
first / one off his tables / printed in the said book off 70. Archbishopes /
which table if it had contained nothing but folly / it should have lien still
for all me: But hauuing matter off impiety (as me thought) I thought it very
necessary to detect it.

The effect is to show what a creator off Bishopes he has been / and howmany
he has consecrated / in his days / their university / their age / profession
/ degree off learning / diocese / and natural contrye / a matter (I warrant) it
off great profit. And in the fifthe column theroff / you see noted the order /
that every. off these Bishopes were off / which is either presbiter secular or
presbiter reguler / and one or two he calls minister secular: belike because
he thought (for I will not think that he would have us think (that only there
were not anointed / with those fulsome orders. If this be set down as an
honor unto them / I dare pronounce for a great sort off them / wheroff many be
godly men / they think them selves dishonored by this honor. And if the
puttinge on off fac^lothe / or casting ashes on their crowns / would scowre a
way that mark / they would do it with ready hearts. But the blood off Christ
washes clea^er then ashes can scowre / and who lived in those pitchie times /
and was not bepitched. If these titles off orders / be set down / to tell the
trothe / first what was that to the purpose / or to what good? For though
nothing is to be said at any time But the trothe / yet I see not that all the
truth is to be said at all times. Had not the book been perfect without such
an unnecessary table / or the table perfect without such unnecessary column?

And if the simple playnes / and singlenes off the writer / were such as he
must needs tell all the truth / why did he not at least / in the behalf off
those godly men / and preachers off the truth / set out withal / this truth
also / that is / how sort they are / and ashamed of that their former
priesthood and how loathsome these disorderly orders are to them? for if in
our familiar talk / one to an other / even very honest humanity / and good
manner forbids to name any unclean word / not having first regarded the
reverence off the he^arers: how can it but provoke vomit / to any good
spiritual stomach / if we in matters off divinity / speak off such
sluttish things / as (sauinge of spiritual reverence) that beastly mark of
the Roman sacrifising preisthood without showing by some little word before
/ or after / what we think off it. I would be glad to enterpret well off it /
this I like not that in the same table / next after the Archbishopp / who must
needs be first / though he had been but benet and collect / There are placed
the regular priests. I can not think / he honored those above the other /
and yet me thinks / as in the Romanist Church / they have the higher place /
in so much that the oother / though affter a sort / and in regard off the lay
men / were called spiritual / or men off the Church rather (for all other were
counted worldly) yet even those men off holy Church were also called seculer
/ in respect off the only simply and wholye sperituall professed regulars.
Contrariwise (I say) with a zelouse professed gospeller / they should have
been the more detested / and therefore placed in the ay^e. I speak not off the
men / (...) or^ers which orders. I am (...) mislike in them / they them (...)
abhore in them selves.

But that which is worse / though tha^ there be diverse wrongly named / who as
I ^hinke having never been priest / are yet named priests secular / there is in
the midst off them only two / whear of one in the one province / and one in
the other / are set down mynisters. And they forsothe because they must ^ee
diffigured / like the other are also termed ministri s^culares first you did
wrong / so to nyckname all the other Christ an men / or bishopes / as to
miscall them priests either secular / or regular / who have put out that
character / and c^^^ue put off those unclean orders by rep^ntaunce / as if
they had never been / and are become prechers off the glorious gospel off
Jesus Christ.

Item / now you do great wrong / to those other / by giving them a name / in
any part common with Idolatrous priests / them I say / who even at the first /
were called immediately / to the holy mynistrie / off the glad tydinges / off
our salvation / revealed now again / more cleerlie in these last days
especyally: the profession / and institution off that preisthode being so
contrary to the calling off this mynistrie / as Antechrist to Christ / and
Baal to the living god.

Besides this epithete (secular) how contrary is it / to the function off a
spiritual pastor / a minister / off the word off God / and breaker off the
bread off life? where out off the Roman clergy / shall a man find / such a
title for the minister off the word / as to call him a minister secular. What
else did cause Demas to step from the ministerye / but presens seculum? And
what an heap off injuries / are done to the ministers off the glorious gospel
off Jesus Christ / to call them Regular Priests / or secular preistes / still
/ that have shaken it off / and have happelye disgraded themselves / by taking
upon them / a far better degree: then theroff to call them priests secular /
which wear never other / then ministers off the word off God. And even he /
whom he himself calls minister yet because he should not disgrace (whearin
me thinks / the violence is offered / rather to the Gospel / then to the
minister) that ignomimous Priesthood off Baal / and shame there stained
garments / with his fater garmente / that therefore / he must also / be
disguised with this Popish addition / and profaned epithet off secular.
Perhaps the spirit which was in Caiphas his monthe and made hi^ prophecye
unware / was also in his penn / that wrote this book / in calling them
secular / whom indeade th^s presens seculum / and the honors theroff has made
to worldly / and bewitched / to the great ruthe / off many good Christian
hearts. I beseech God / with his so^rte / to open their eyes / that theye
may see / and be hartelye sorye so to have made / so many so sorye. Which I
yet hoope for / and then / we shall be gladd togithere. I am almost carried a
way.

There lurkeeh yet / a further danger / under these words / Minister secular.
For though in the dark days / or off those men / that wear consecrate / or
rather execrate / to that most vile unholy sacrifice / it had some reason / to
call the Massinge Priest / a priste secular thereby / to make distinction
between him / and the only spiritual regular: yet / in this time off the
Gospel / to call one / that was godly called / to the blissed / and high
office / in Gods Church off preachinge the Gospel / off the Lord Jesus / who
also did never vow / to sacrifice that blasphemous oblation / and Idol / but
was moved only / to advance the kingdom off God / by preachinge his word / to
call such one (I say) and in these days a Minister secular / besides the
other open euilles this also lurketh dangerouslye / that yt may be probablye
thought / there is nourished some reuerente estimation off the regular / and
easelye to be implied that it might be lawefull / enoughe even in the Church
off God / to have Ministers also regulars. Else / what need this distinction
off secular Minister now / the other being justly gone / and banished?

And this Church off England / allowinge no man devised order / off regular
ministry: The very entertayninge / off these badde names / off Poperye / is
not good / and it is strange / that any gospeller / should delighte in them /
and here / theye are not used without further peril. For though the times be
such / and so enriched with knoweledge / as A number off children / would not
vouchsafe to laughe / at many off these dotinge toys: yet there be also to
many / that cannot / and to to many that will not discern / between
counterfaited dross / and right drugges / but so it be in gilded box / and
have the name off some wholesome spice / written on it: all is one with them /
even to the loss off there healthes everlasting / and death / hoth off body
/ and soul. Whear against / though I be not so learned a Phisicio^ / as to
prescribe any excellent receipte / or sovereign triacle / but leave that /
to be done by some Galene: ye thought I neuerthe less / to do the part off
an honest Apothecarye who / being not able to tell the remedy / will yet
warn off the poison.

The Lord off all health / preserve the sound / from all infections / and
restore the infected / to there soundnes again / giuinge them patience / in
the mean time / like good patients / to suffer such medicine / as shall be
applied to remedy off there contagious disease / with the remembrance off
this / that noe medicine is so wholesome / as that / which brings greatest
sorrow / and that the wounds off a brother / or freende / are sweeter / then
the soft pillowes of an enemy.
