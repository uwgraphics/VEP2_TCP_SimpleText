The Conuercyon of swerers.



THe fruitful sentence and the noble works
To our doctrine wry te^i old a^tyquyte
By many great and right notable clerks
Grounded on reason and high auctoryte
Did give us example by good moralyte
To follow the trace of troth and right wysnes
Leuynge our sin and mortal wrechednes
By their writing does to us appear
The famous acts of many a champyon
In the court of fame renowned fair and clear
And some endyted their entencyon
Cloked in color hard in construccyon
Specially poets under cloudy fygures
Covered the truth of all their scryptures
So hystoryagraphes all the worthy deeds
Of kings and knights did put in writing
To be in mende for their memoryall medes
How should we now have knowledgynge
Of things past / but by their end ytynge
Wherefore we ought to praise them doubteles
That spent their time in such good busynes.
Among all other my good master Lydgate
The eloquent poet and monk of bury
Did both contryue and also translate
Many virtues books to be in memory
Touching the truth well and sentencyously
But sith that his death was intolerable
I pray god reward him in life perdurable
Among all things nothing so profitable
As is science with the sentencyous scripture
For wordely richesse is often transmutable
As daily does appear well in ure
Yet science abides and is most sure
After pouerte to attain great rycheste
Science is cause of promocyon doubtelesse
I little or naught expert in poetry
Remembrynge my yough so light and frail
Purpose to compyle here full breuyatly
A little treatise woeful to be wayle
The cruel swerers which do god assail
On every side his sweet body to tere
With terryble oaths as often as they swear
But also for dread plonged in neclygence
My pen does quake to presume to endyte
But hope at last to recure this science
Exorteth me right herdely to write
To deuoyde ydelnesse by good appetyte
For ydelnesse the great mother of sin
Every vice is vedy to let ynne.
I with the same right gret^ly infecte
Lykely to dye till grace by medycyne
Recured my sekenes my pain to abiecte
Commanndynge me by her hye power deuyne
To draw this treatise for to enliunyne
The reders thereof by penytencyall ^yte
And to pardon me of their benyguyte
Right mighty princes of every cryste^ regyon
I send you gretynge much heartily and grace
Right well to govern vpryght your domynyon
And all your lords I great in like case
By this my letter you hertes to enbrace
Besechynge you to prynte it in your mind
Now for your sake I took on me mankind
And as a lamb most mekely did enclyne
To suffer the death for your redempcyon
And ye my kings which do now domyne
Over my comens in terrestryall mancyon
By pryncely premynence and iuredyccyon
In your regal courts do suffer me be rent
And my tender body with blood all be sprent.
Without my grace ye may nothing prevail
Though ye be kings for to mayntene your see
To be a king it may nothing avail
But yt my grace preserve his dygnyte
Beh^lde your servants how they do tere me
By cruel oaths now upon every side
About the world launsynge my wounds wide
All the graces which I have you showed
Reuolue in mind right often ententyfly
Behold my body with blody drops endewed
Within your realms now torn s^pyteously
Towsed and tugged with oaths cruelly
Some my heed some mine arms and face
Some my heart do all to rent and race
They new again do hang me on the rode
They tere my sides and are nothing dysmayde
My wounds they do open and devour my blood
I god and man most woefully arayde
To you complain it may not be denayde
Ye now to tugge me / ye tere me at the root
Yet I to you am chief refuyte and bote
Wherefore ye kings reygnynge in renown
Refourme your servants in your court abused
To good example of every manner town
So that their oaths which they long have used
On pain and punysshement be holly refused
Meke as a lamb I suffered their great wrong
I may take vengeance though I tarry long
I do forhere I would have you amend
And grant you mercy and ye will it take
O my sweet brethren why do ye offend
Again to tere me which dyed for your sake
Lose my kyndnes and from sin a wake
I did redeem you from the deuylles chain
And spyte of me ye will to them again
Made I not heaven the most glorious mancyon
In which I would be glad to have you in
Now come sweet brethren to mine habytacyon
Alas good brethren with your mortal sin
Why flee ye from to turn again begin
I wrought you / I bought you / ye can it not deny
Yet to the devil ye go now wyllyngly


See

Again
My pain

My face right read
Mine arms spredde.
My wounds bledde

Behold thou my side
Wounded so right wide
Bledynge sore that tide
All for thyn own sake
Thus for the I smerted
Why art you hard herted

Unto me dear brother my love and my heart
Tourmente me no more with thy oaths great
Come unto me my joy and again reuerte
From the deuylles snare and his subtell net
Beware of the world all about the set
The flesh is ready by concupycence
To burn thy heart with cursed vyolence
Though these three enemies do sore the assail
Upon every side with dangerous iniquite
But if thou list they may nothing prevail
Nor yet subdue the with all their extremyte
To do good or ill all is at thy lyberte
I do grant the grace thine enymyes to subdue
Sweet brother accept it their power to extue
And ye kings and princes of hye noblenes
With dukes and lords of every dygnyte
Endued with manhood wysoome and riches
Over the commons having the soueraynte
Correct them which so do tere me
By cruel oaths without repentance
Amend by time lest I take vengeance
Exodi vicesimo. Non accipies nomen dei cui in vanum.
Unto the man I gave commandment
Not to take the name of thy god vaynfully
As not to swear but at time conuenyent
Before a Judge to bear record truly
Namynge my name with reverence mekely
Unto the Judge than there in presence
By my name to give good credence
A my brethren if that I be wroth
It is for cause ye falsely by me swear
Ye know your self that I am the very truth
Yet wrongefully ye do me rent and tere
Ye neither love me nor my justice fere
And if ye did ye would full gentylly
Obey my bidding well and perfytely
The wordely kings having the soueraynte
Ye do well obey without resystence
Ye dare not take their names in vanyte
But with great honor and eke reverence
Thou my name more hye of magnyfycence
Ye ought more to dread which am king of all
Both god and man and regne celestyall
None erthely man loves you so well
As I do which mekely enclyne
For to redeem you from the fendes of hell
Taking your kind by my godhede dyuyne
You were the fendes I did make you mine
For you sweet brethren I was on the rode
Gyuynge my body my heart and my blood
Than why do ye in every manner of place
With cruel oaths tere my body and heart
My sides and wounds it is a pyteous case
Alas sweet brethren I would you convert
For to take vengeance ye do me coherte
From the house of swerers shall not be absente
The plage of Justice to take punysshment
Vnde. Ecclesiastici xxxiii. Vir multu^ iurans imple
bitur iniquitate et non descendet a domo plaga
A man much swerynge with great iniquite
Shall be replete and from his mancyon
The plage of pest ylence shall not seized be
Wherefore ye brethren full of abusyon
Take good head to this dyscrecyon
Come now to me and ask forgyuenes
And be penitent and have it doubtless
Augustinus. Non potest male mori qui been vixit et vir been moritur qui male
vixit.
Who in this world lives well and ryghtwysly
Shall dye well by right good knowlegynge
Who in this world lives wrongfully
Shall hardely escape to have good ending
I do grant mercy but no time enlongynge
Wherefore good brethren while that ye have space
A mende your life and come unto my grace
My words my prelates unto you do preche
For to convert you from your wretchedness
But little avails you now for to teache
The world has cast you in such blyndnes
Like unto stones your hearts has hardenes
That my sweet words may not reconsyle
Your hertes hard with mortal sin so vile
Woe worth your hertes so planted in pride
Woe worth your wrath and mortal envy
Woe worth slouthe that does with you abide
Woe worth also immesurable glotony
Woe worth your tedyous sin of lechery
Woe worth you whom I gave tree will
Woe worth couetyse that does your souls spyll
Woe worth short joy cause of pain eternal
Woe worth you that be so perverted
Woe worth your pleasures in your sins mortal
Woe worth you for whom I sore smerted
Woe worth you ever but ye be converted
Woe worth you whose making I repent
Woe worth your horrible sin so vyolent
Woe worth you which do me forsake
Woe worth you which wyllyngly offend
Woe worth your swerynge which does not aslake
Woe worth you which will nothing amend
Woe worth vice that on you does atttende
Woe worth your great unkindness to me
Woe worth your hertes withouten pity.
Woe worth your falshode and doubleness
Woe worth also your corrupt judgment
Woe worth delight in worldly richesse
Woe worth debate without extynguysshement
Woe worth your words so much impacyent
Woe worth you unto whom I did boot
And woe worth you that tere me at heart root.
Blessed be ye that love hum ylyte
Blessed be ye that love truth and pacyence
Blessed be ye following the works of equity
Blessed be ye that love well abstynence
Blessed be ye byrgyngs of excellence
Blessed be ye which love well virtue
Blessed be ye which does the world eschew.
Blessed be ye that heavenly joy do love
Blessed be ye in virtuous governance
Blessed be ye which do pleasures reprove
Blessed be ye that consider my greuaunce
Blessed be ye which do take repentance
Blessed be ye remembrynge my passion
Blessed be ye making petycyon
Blessed be ye following my trace
Blessed be ye loving trybulacyon
Blessed be ye not willing to trespace
Blessed be ye of my castygacyon
Blessed be ye of good operacyon
Blessed be ye unto me right kind
Blessed be you which have me in your mind
Blessed be ye leuynge evil company
Blessed be ye hauntynge the virtuous
Blessed be ye that my name magnyfy
Blessed be ye techynge the vycyous
Blessed be ye good and relygous
Blessed be ye in life temperall
Which apply your self to joy celestyall
The byrtyll world right often transmutable
Who will it in this life and time well spend
Shall joy attain after inestymable
For in this world he must first condyscende
To take great pain as his power will extend
Against the world the flesh and the devil
By my great grace for to withstand their evil
For who can be a greter fool than he
That spends his time to him uncertain
For a breuyat pleasure of worldly vanyte
Than after that to have eternal pain
Who of the world delyteth and is feign
Shall after sorrow and cry ve be
In another world quante sunt tenebre
Who is wyser than he that will apply
In the world take great pain by due dylygence
After short pain to come great glory
Which is eterne most hye of excellence
Where he shall se my great magnyfycence
With many aungelles which for their solace
Insacyately do behold my face
Regard no Joy of erthely consystory
For like as phoebus does the snow relente
So passyth the joys of the world transytory
Time renneth fast till worldely life be spente
Consider this in your entendemente
Blessed be they that my words do here
And keep it well / for they are to me dear
Therefore good brederne your hertes enclyne
To love and dread me that am omnipotent
Both god and man in joy celestyne
Behold my body all to torn and rent
With your spytefull oaths cruel and vyolent
I love you ye hate me ye are to hard hearted
I help you ye tere me lo how for you I smarted.
Mercy and peace did make and unity
Between you and me but truth and right wysnesse
Do now complain bidding my goohede se
How that ye break the lege of soth fastness
They tell me that by justice doubtelesse
I must take vengeance upon you sykerly
That by your swerynge again me crucyfy
For at the request of good mercy and pease
I have forborne you long and many a day
Yet more and more your sins do increase
Wherefore my justice will no more delay
But take vengeance for all your proud array
I warn you often ye are nothing the better
But ye amend my vengeance shall be gretter.
Contra iuratores xperm i^ celo crucifige^tes: per ber
nardu^ dixit du^s. Nonne satis prote vulneratus su^?
no^ne satis afflictus su^edesine a^plius peccare: qr magis
aggrauat vulnus peccati quod vulnus lateris me.
Am not I wounded for the suffycyent
Have I not for the enough affection
Leave more to sin by good amendment
The wound of sin to me is more passion
Than the wound of my side for thy redempcyon
Though I do spare I shall not desteny
But ye amend to brenne eternally
With my blody wound I did your charter seal
Why do ye tere it why do ye break it so
Sith it to you is the eternal heal
And the relefe of ever lasting woe
Behold this lettre with the prynte also
Of mine own seal by perfyte portrayture
Prynte it in mind and ye shall health recure
And ye kings and lords of renown
Exhort your servants their swerynge to cease
Come unto me and cast your sin adowne
And I my vengeance shall truly release
With grace and plente I shall you increase
And bring you which reuolue inwardely
This my complaynte to eternal glory
AMEN
The auctoure.
Go little treatise deuoyde of eloquence
Trembling for dread to approach the majesty
Of our sovereign lord surmountynge in excelle^ce
But under the wynge of his benygnyte
Submyttynge the to his merciful pety
And beseech his grace to pardon thy rudenes
Which of late was made to eschew ydelnes
Thus ends the conuersyon of swerers made and compyled by Stephen Hawys grome
of ye chamber of our sovereign lord king Henry the seventh.
