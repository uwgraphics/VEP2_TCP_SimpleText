TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE SIR EDWARD BARKSHAM, KNIGHT, Lord Mayor of the City of
London; and to the right Worshipful, the Shriefes and Aldermen his Brethren.
THe very Arts (Right Honorable and Worshipful) which were wont to bear the
attributions of [ honestae and liberales] seem now to temporize, and to have
learned the newfound skill of equivocation. For, howsoever the former of these
denominations adhereth censtantly unto the Professors of Mathematick Sciences,
yet the other, which was once derived [ a liberalitate] and then intimated,
that they were anciently accustomed to perform liberal recompense to their
lovers and followers, has now (to spare cost) purchased a different etymology
[ a libertate] as properly accommodate to such as are [ liberi] freeborne, or
(as our peculiar term carries) Freemen. Which being so, and seeing that in
this particular, as well as in many other of greater consequence, Tempora
mutantur --: I am thereby enforced to make up the old verse, adding -- e^ nos
mutamur in illis; and to apply my long experience, together with tedious
studies bestowed in this present art of numbers, to the use and be hoof of
those persons, to whom by the general appellation it properly belongs,
namely, to the studious thereof in this honorable City. Which is the cause
that I presume (without farther selfe-praise, of what I have brought more
useful, more easy, or more certain and delightful in the operations, then
has been seen before) to present my Labors to your Hononrable and
Worshipful judgments, to whom I owe of duty, whatsoever can be of me
performed, to the furtherance of Art, and the honor of this noble City, and
the worthy Companies therein.

Your Honors, and Worships devoted in all humble respect, JOHN JOHNSON,
Suruaighor.

THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.
GEntle and Courteous Reader; having for many years past spent my time both in
reading, practicing, and conferring with others in, and about the study of the
Mathematical Sciences, and through great pains and travel, at the request of
diverse Worshipful Gentlemen. Merchants, and others of my very loving friends,
have at last collected and gathered together many excellent Rules and easy
Abreuiations in the Science of Arithmatick, which at the entreaty, and by the
means of the help of some of them, I have at last made bold here to present
abroad unto the worlds view, the first fruits of some idle hours study, the
most part whereof I do acknowledge to have gotten by the practice and use of
the most excellent Instrument, invented by Master William Pratt, called, The
Jewel of Arithmatick in which I have done the best of my Endeavors, not to
hide that Tallent in the earth, which God has bestowed upon me for the benefit
of others, but rather to his great glory and praise, and for the benefit of my
Country, and for the furthering of all that are studious in the Art of Numbers,
I have labored to set it forth in the most brief, plain, and easy manner
that I could fit for the understanding of the weakest and meanest capacity. In
which if any thing shall seem obscure or doubtful to any man, I could wish my
self were present to resolve his doubts, for I have indeauoured to make the
Rules as brief, short and easy, as I could devise.

In my first Book I have entreated concerning vulgar Arithmatick, with new
inventions of my own, in all the first four parts of Arithmatick, viz in
Addition and Subtraction, with two several kinds of Multiplication, not
charging of the memory, never extant before in any Author that I have read,
with four several kinds of Division, the latter of them bringing the proof
by Addition of the figures under the dividend, without any multiplication, or
casting away of nines, according to the accustomed manner.

Again, in the work of Fractions, I have set them forth in plain and perfect
figures after another manner of my own invention, because the fractionall
figures in most books of Arithmatick were so imperfect, that they were scarce
to be descerned, and in this manner they will perform all factionall
operations, as well as if they were set out according to the usual manner. In
the end of which Rules I have showed the reasons and proofs of fractions by
the known parts of Coin.

Thirdly, in the second part of the former book, I have set forth Reduction,
both in Coin sterling `waights, measures, time and motion; the Tables whereof
are in the first part of the book, with diverse Rules how to bring pence, or
farthings at the first work into pounds, shillings and pence; with diverse
questions wrought by Reduction, with Progression Arithmaticall and
Geometrical, with examples.

And lastly, I have showed how to work the Rule of 3 Direct and Conuerst, both
in whole numbers and fractions, after diverse several manners of workings, and
how to find the divisor in any question, as also diverse ways to work
Fellowship, Barter, Exchange, Allegation, Interest, Position, and all other
operations Arithmeticall, with examples and brief Rules of every part.

In my second book of Decimall Arithmatick, I have first described out the
parts and use of the decimall Table, and how to set forth any number given in
Decimalls.

Secondly, I have showed how to work all the several parts of Arithmatick,
viz. Numeration, Addition, Subtraction* Multiplication and Division in
Decimalls; with examples and proofs of every work in the known parts of
Coin.

Thirdly, I have handled in as brief manner as I could, the Rule of 3
Fellowship, Barter, Exchange and Interest in Decimall Arithmatick, as before in
vulgar, in which you may perceive the great labor that is avoided, in vulgar
Arithmatick, with diverse examples and proofs of the same.

Lastly, I have added a small Treatice of Interest and Annuities; with the
manner how to calculate Tables or Breuiats at any rate, or years purchase
given; all which I have drawn into a pocket vollume. If therefore any
Gentleman, Merchant, or other, be desirous to have further instruction, if they
repair to my lodging in Coleman-street, I shall be ready to give them any
satisfaction.

If therefore I shall find these my labors and indeauors to take that effect,
which I do hope and wish for, I shall be thereby the sooner encouraged to
hasten the coming forth of the third part of this volume concerning the
extraction of Roots, with many easy operations and rules showing the use of
the Square and ^ubicque roots, concerning Mensurations of land Timber, Board,
Glass and Stone, and the reduction of Measures from one proportion to another
by their squares given: and lastly, concerning Millitary affairs and Gunners
Art; concerning the Arithmeticall work, with demonstration by examples, which
I had intended to have joined to this vollume, but that it would have increased
it far beyond a pocket book. And so hoping of your friendly censure and
acceptance of these first fruits of my labors, I cease, hoping to have my true
indeauors and meaning well taken, and the faults in the Printing friendly
amended, desiring a blessing from God upon these my poor labors, I take my
leave,

IOHNSONS ARITHMETIC.
CAHP. I. Numeration.
NVmeration is the first part of Arithmaticke, which shows how to pronounce
the value of any number of figures given; which are expressed by ten figures,
whereof the tenth is a Cipher, signifying nothing of it self; but being joined
with figures, helps to increase the value: the figures are these;

one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, cipher. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.
6. 7. 8. 9. 0.

How to express the value of a number given.
If a number be given, whose value is to be expressed, you shall understand,
that the figure next the right hand is the least in value, and signifies
simply his own value, as the figure of 1 does signify but one, and the figure
of 2 does signify but two, and the figure of 8 signifies but eight, and so of
any other. And in the second place toward the left hand, every figure is in
value ten, so that the figure of one there does signify ten, the figure of
2 twenty, the figure of 8 eighty, and so of all other: in the third place
toward the left hand, every figure is in value one hundred, so that the figure
1 in that place signifies one hundred, the 2, two hundred, etc. In the fourth
place, every figure is in value one thousand, so there the figure of one
signifies one thousand, the figure 2, two thousand, etc. In the fifth place,
every figure is in value ten thousand: in the sixth place, one hundred
thousand; and in the seventh place, one thousand thousands, or one million: in
the eight place, ten millions: in the ninth place, one hundred millions: in the
tenth place, one thousand millions, or one milliot; and so infinitely names may
be given to the value of every prick, as is usual in the second part of
Arithmetic, of Number, Square, Cube, sursolid, etc. or in Astronomicall
Arithmetic, Primes, Seconds, Thirds, Fourths and Fifths, etc.

Now to express the value of any number given, set a prick with the pen over
the fourth figure toward the left hand, and over the seventh, and tenth; and
so over every third figure toward the left hand, to the end of your figures,
as in this Example:

^

Now begin and express the first four figures toward the right hand, as if
they stood alone, which are 2567, or two thousand five hundred sixty seven.
Then read the figures belonging to the second prick, which are 430, as if they
stood alone thus, four millions three hundred two thousand five hundred sixty
seven: then take the three figures belonging to the third prick, which are 635,
or six millions three hundred fifty four millions three hundred and two
thousand five hundred sixty seven: and so this whole sum is thus to be
read, two hundred thirty seven thousand eight hundred fifty six milliots three
hundred fifty four millions three hundred and two thousand five hundred and
sixty seven; and so of any other sum.

CHAP. II. Addition.
ADdition is the second part of Arithmatick, and serves to add or collect
diverse sums of several denominations, and to express their total value in
one sum.

In Addition begin to add your sums at the right hand with the smallest
numbers or denominations first, and gathering of their total mark how many of
the smaller makes one of the next greater; as if your addition be Farthings,
for every four farthings carry one penny in mind to be added to the numbers in
the place of pence, and for every 12 put one shilling into the number of
shillings, and for every 20 shillings, one pound into the place of pounds; and
therefore to know how many of the smaller denominations, makes one of the next
greater: I have here added in this place the several Tables of Coin sterling,
of Weights, of liquid Measures, and dry Measures, of long Measures, of Time
and Motion; which are very necessary to be known of every Practicioner in
Arithmatick, before he proceeds any further in the practice of Arithmatick,
being used in every particular Rule of Arithmatick more or less.

The Table of Coin Sterling.
Pence Farth. Four farthings makes one penny -- 1 4 One shilling is -- 12 48
One pound Sterling is 20 shillings -- 240 960 One hundred pound Sterling is* --
24000 96000

12. 4. 14079. 12. 3. 3.

The explanation of these examples.
In the first example toward the left hand I begin with farthings, which are 3,
which I set down: then next 9 pence and 11 is 20, and 2 is 22, and 1 makes 23,
and 2 makes 25, and 3 makes 28, and 11 makes 39 pence, or 3 shillings 3 pence;
I set down the 3 pence, and carry in mind the 3 shillings to be added to the
place of shillings. Then add the several sums of shillings, which are 1. 1.
2 7. 8, the total is 19, and the 3 in mind makes 22 shillings; set down the 2
shillings, and keep two tennes to be added to the tennes of shillings, which
are 3 tens, which makes 5 tennes, or 50 shillings; set down the odd ten to
the 2 shillings, which makes 12 shillings, and carry 2 pound for the forty
shillings to the next place of pounds, which are 5. 9. 6. 4. 7. 2. 4, and the 2
in mind makes 39; leave the 9 under the place of unites, and carry 3 tennes in
mind, and 7. 5. 5. 5. 8. 2. 2, total is 37; set down the 7 under the place of
tennes, and carry 3 in mind for the 30 tennes, which is 3 hundred: then 3 in
mind, and 2. 8. 8. 3. 1. 2. 3, total is 30; set a cipher, or 0 in the place of
hundreds, and carry 3 for the 30 into the place of thousands: then last of all,
3 in mind, and 3. 7. 1 makes 14 thousand, and because it is the last sum, you
must set them all down, placing the 4 under the place of thousands, and the 1
one place more toward the left hand, and then the Total sum of those
particulars will be 14079 pound, 12 shillings, 3 pence, 3 farthings, as
appears in the example; and in the like manner is the other example to be
cast up into one Total: and so I will here end with Addition of Coin, and put
a several example of every table for the full tables and perfect understanding
of the said table, which are of great use in all the several rules of
Arithmetic.

The Explanation.
In the Haberdepoyse weight, 20 grains makes one scruple, 3 scruples one dram,
8 drams one ounce, 16 ounces one pound, 112 pound is one hundred of the
Haberdepoyse weight, whereby is sold all kind of Merchandise usual in this
Realm, and therefore in Addition of Waights Haberdepoyse, for every 3
scruples add one dram, and for every 8 drams one ounce, and for 16 ounces 1
pound, for 28 pound one quarter of a hundred, and for every 4 quarters one
hundred. first, I begin with the drams in the first example to the right hand,
which are 3. 1. 3, total is 7 drames, which I note down underneath, because
they are less then one ounce. Secondly, the ounces are 3. 7. 2. 12. 8. total
is 32 ounces, or 2 pound, because 16 ounces is one pound; which two I set under
the place of pounds with a light touch of the pen for to remember it the
better, and place a Cipher in the place of ounces.

Thirdly, the pounds are 2. 10. 1. 12. 10. 17 total is 52 pound, which is one
quarter of a hundred, and 24 pound, place 24 pound under the place of pounds,
and put one quarter, as before in the place of quarters of hundreds.

Fourthly, 1. 3. 1. 2. 3 quarters, are 10 quarters, or 2 hundred and 2
quarters, or half a hundred; place 2 quarters in the place of quarters, and
put over 2 into the place of hundreds for the 8 quarters.

Then 2. 7. 2. 7. 3. 8. 7 makes 36 hundred, place 6, and carry 3 for the 30:
then say, 3. 1. 2. 1. 3. 1. 2, total is 13; place 3 there, and carry one for
the 10, which one in mind, and 1. 1 makes 3, which set down, and the total is
336 hundred, 2 quarters, 24 pound, 0 ounces, 7 drammes; and so the other
example is in the same manner to be cast up, and so of all other.

12 signs 1 Fifth. 1679616000000 sixths is 12 Signs -- 1 Sixth.

The explanation of these Tables, and the examples following.
First, in the example of Acres, Roods and Perches; for 40 Perches put 1 Rood
into the place of Roods, and for every 4 Roods one Acre.

Secondly, for every 4 quarters of Inch, take 1 Inch, and for every 12 Inches 1
foot, and for every 3 foot, one yard.

Thirdly, for 16 pints take one pecke, and for every 4 peckes one Bushel, into
the place of Bushels.

Fourthly, for every 8 pints of liquid measure, take one Gallon, and for every
63 Gallons one Hogshead.

Fifthly, in the example of time; for 60, minutes take one hour, and for 24
hours one day, and for 365 days, one year.

Sixthly, for 4 nails take one quarter of a yard, and for 4 quarters one yard,
etc.

Lastly, in the example of motion, for 60 thirds, take 1 second, and for 60
seconds take one minute, and for 60 minutes take one degree, and for 30 degrees
take one Sign.

And this is the use of these Tables in Addition and Subtraction; for look
what you carry over in Addition, that you must borrow in Subtraction, I will
hear add examples of every kind, leaving the Reader to exercise himself by

The Proof of Addition.
The proof of Addition is made by Subtraction; for if you subtract the numbers
which you added from the total of the Addition, there will remain nothing, if
the work be truly done.

Example. l. s. d. q. 378567. 19. 10. 1. 240023. 10. 2. 0. 854^26. 07. 1. 0.
785634. 13. 3. 2. 320500. 00. 11. 1. 2 2 Total, 2579^52. 11. 4. 0.

First, add together the greatest Sums in value in the place of hundred
thousands, which makes 23, which take from 25, and there will remain 2: then
the figures in the fifth place, 26 taken from 27, there will remain 1.
Thirdly, the figures in the place of thousands, makes 17, which taken from 19,
leaves 2: then 19 in the place of hundreds taken from 20, leaves 1: and again,
13 in the place of tennes from 15, leaves 2: and lastly, 20 in the place of
unites from 22 ponnd, leaves 2 pound: then 49 shillings from 2 pound 11
shillings, leaves 2 shillings* also 2 shillings 3 pence in the place of pence,
from 2 shillings 4 pence, leanes 1: and last of all, 4 farthings from 1 penny,
leaves nothing, which proves the work to be truly wrought.

^

The second proof of Addition.
Cut of the uppermost numbers with a dash of the pen, and add the remayner
into one Total; and then subtract that sum from the whole total, and the
remayner will be the numbers which you cut off, if the work be true, else not.

Example. 378567. 19. 10. 1. 240023. 10. 2. 0. 854326. 7. 1. 0. 785634. 13. 3.

And so much shall suffice to have spoken of Addition, and the proof thereof.

Questions of Addition.
What number is that, to the which if you do add 45, the total will be 357.

Answer: Subtract 45 from 357, remains 312.

Example. 357 45 312

What three numbers are those, to which if you add 27, 36, and 45, their
products shall be equal, and the sum arising shall be 120.

What number is that, to the which if you do add 354 pound, 7 shsllings, 9
pence, the total will be 512 pound, 15 shillings, o penny. Answer: Subtract
354 pound, 7 shillings, 9 pence, from 512 pound, 15 shillings, o penny, and the
remainder will be 158 pound, 7 shillings, 3 pence, which is the number that
you do seek.

Example. l. s. d. 512. 15. 0. 354. 7. 9. 158. 7. 3.

CHAP. III. Subtraction.
SVbtraction s^^^eth to deduct one sum from another, the lesser from the
greater, and to show the remains.

Place your greater number, from which the Subtraction is to be made, in the
uppermost part, and the number to be subtracted, or deducted right underneath
every figure under his like kind, or denomination, viz. pounds under pounds,
shillings under shillings, and pence under pence, etc. in this manner.

l. s. d. q. Lent. 7756. 13. 10. 1. Paid 3949. 17. 11. 2. Rest. 3806. 15. 10.
3. Proof. 7756. 13. 10. 1.

Then begin your subtraction at the left hand, at the smallest numbers; but if
the lowest figure of the undermost numbers be the greatest, that it cannot be
abated out of the number above it, then add one of your next greater
denomination, and make your subtraction from both, noting the remainer; as if
you have 10 pence to take from 7 pence, add one shilling, or 12 pence, unto 7
pence, that makes 19 pence; then take 10 pence from 19 pence, and there will
remain 9 pence, which note down under the 10 pence: and because you did
borrow one shilling, therefore in the number of shillings you shall take away
one more then it is, in the next place of shillings, and this rule is general,
in Coin, Measure, Time, Motion, or any other thing else whatsoever.

The explanation of these examples.
In the first example of Coin, begin your subtraction at the right hand,
saying; 1 farthing from 3 farthings, leaves 2 farthings, which note down under
the 1 farthing. Then 10 pence from 11 pence, leaves 1 penny. Thirdly, 19
shillings from 17 shillings you cannot have, therefore take one pound, or 20
shillings, and add to 19 shillings, saying, 19 shillings from 37 shillings,
rests 18 shillings, which note down. Then 1 that you borrowed, and 3 pound, is
4 pound from 6 pound, leaves 2 pound to set down under 3. Then 8 from 8 leaves
nothing, place there a Cipher, or 0 under 8. Then 5 from 7 rests 2; then 2 from
9 leaves 7, which also note again; 9 from 8 cannot be taken, then make it 10
more, and say 9 from 18 leaves 9, which set down: and last of all, 1 borrowed
and 6 is 7, from 7 leaves nothing, and the work is ended, and the remayner
will be 97202 pound 18 shillings 1 penny 2 farthings, as appears in the
example before going.

The exposition of the second example.
First, take 15 ounces from 10, which cannot be, then add 1 pound, or 16
ounces to 10, makes 26; then say, 15 from 26 leaves 11 ounces, which note
down: then 1 borrowed and 24 is 25, from 27 pound leaves 2 pound remaining;
then 2 quarters from 3 quarters, leaves 1 quarter remaining; then 8 from 7
cannot be, therefore take 8 from 17, rest 9, which note down: then one
borrowed and 3 makes 4, from 12 rests 8, and the work is done, and the remain
is 89 hundred 1 quarter 2 pound 11 ounces.

3 Example.

First, take 59 minutes from 56 minutes cannot be, but then take 59 minutes from
60 minutes, or one hour, and there will remain 1 minute, which add to 56
minutes, and that will make 57 minutes, which note down in the place of
minutes: then 1 borrowed and 15 hours makes 16 hours, which taken from 20
hours leaves 4, which note under the 15; and then 2 days from 0 cannot be,
but 2 from 10, and there will remain 8, which note down: then 1 borrowed and
2 makes 3, from 4 leaves 1; also 1 from 3 leaves 2: lastly, 1 from 8 leaves 7,
and 8 from 11 leaves 3; then 1 borrowed and 15 makes 16, from 16 leaves
nothing, and the remayner will be 37 years 218 days 4 hours 57 minutes; the
like is done in the other example of Motion, and therefore here needless to be
rehearsed.

To subtract from a Unite.
Set down with your pen a unite in any place, adding Ciphers unto it, and the
several numbers which you will subtract from it of pounds, shillings and pence
right underneath: then note what each several number of your lowest numbers
does want of 9 unto the place of unites, and set that right under for the
remayner: and lastly, note what your shillings and pence does want of 20
shillings, and set that down for your remaynor, and the work is ended.

Example. l. s. d. Lent. 1000000. 00. 00. Paid. 232864. 17. 03. Rest. 767135.
2. 9. Proof. 1000000. 00. 0.

The proof of Subtraction.
The surest proof of Subtraction is made by Addition: for if you do add the
numbers remaining, unto the numbers deducted, they will return your former
Sum, if the work be truly wrought, as will appear in the proof of all the
several examples before going, and therefore here again in this place
needless to be rehearsed. Only I will add one for examples sake.

In the last example, the numbers which did remain, were 767135 pound 2
shillings 9 pence, and the numbers deducted, 232864 pound 17 shillings 3 pence;
these two numbers added together, ought to make a unite in the seventh place;
wherefore I add 9 pence to 3 pence, makes 1 shilling; and 1 shilling to 17
shillings, makes 18 shillings, and 2 shillings makes 20 shillings; then 1 and 4
is 5, and 5 is 10, which is one in the next place: then 1 and 3, and 6 is 10;
and 1 1.8 makes 10, and 1.7.2 makes 10, and 1.6.3 is 10, and lastly 1.7.2 makes
10, or one unite.

THis Table of Multiplication must be learned perfectly by heart, for to know
readily what the multiplication of any two digit numbers under nine, or unto
nine do make, and then Multiplication will be very easy: for Multiplication
is a number of additions speedily performed; as if you should say, How many in
number is 8 times 7, if you should set down 7 eight times one under another,
and add them together, the total will be 56: but if you look in the Table
for 8 in the head, and 7 in the side, you shall find under 8, right against 7
in the the same parallel 56; or if you find 8 in the side, and 7 in the head,
the like number will appear, and these numbers in the table are to be fit in
memory.

1. Example according to the usual way. 87968. The multiplicand. 987. The
multiplier.


First, begin your multiplication at the right hand, saying, 7 times 8 make 56,
place 6 under the 7, and keep 5 in mind, to be added to the product of the
multiplication of 7 by 6, saying, 7 by 6 makes 42, and 5 in mind is 47; set 7
down under the 6, and keep 4 in mind: then 7 by 9 is 63, and 4 makes 67; set
7 down, and keep 6 in mind: then 7 by 7 is 49, and 6 is 55; place 5 and keep
5 in mind: lastly, 7 by 8 is 56, and 5 is 61, which set down the 1 first, and
the 6 one place more toward the right hand; and so the multiplication by the
first figure 7 is done, then cancel the 7 of your multiplyer, and your work
will stand, as in this example.

^

Secondly, begin with 8, the second figure of your multiplier, saying, 8 times
8 is 64; place the 4 under the said 8, and keep the 6 in mind: then 8 by 6 is
48, and 6 makes 54; set down 4 in the next place, and keep 5 in mind: then 8
by 9 is 72, and 5 makes 77; set down 7, and keep 7 in mind: then 8 by 7 is
56, and 7 makes 63; set down 3, and keep 6. Lastly, 8 by 8 is 64, and 6 makes
70; set the 0 first, and the 7 one place more toward the left hand, and
cancel the 8 of your multiplier, and the work will stand thus.

^

Thirdly, begin with 9, the last figure of your multiplyer, saying, 9 by 8 is
72; place the 2 under the said 9, and keep 7: then 9 by 6 is 54, and 7 is 61;
place 1, and keep 6: then 9 by 9 is 81, and 6 is 87; place 7, and keep 8: then
9 by 7 is 63, and 8 is 71* place 1, and keep 7: last of all, 9 by 8 is 72, and
7 is 79; place the 9 first, and the 7 one place more toward the right hand,
and the whole work is ended, then gather the total by addition.

1. Example.

^

2. Examples with Ciphers. ^

The exposition of this example.
First, 7 by 1 is 7, which note down: then 7 by 0 is nothing, set down a 0 in
that place: and next 7 by 5 is 35, set 5, and carry 3: then 7 by 6 is 42, and 3
is 45, place 5, and carry 4: then 7 by 8 is 56, and 4 is 60, set down a 0, and
carry 6 again: 7 by 2 is 14, and 6 makes 20, set down a 0, and carry 2: then
7 by 3 is 21, and 2 makes 23, place 3, and carry 2: then 7 by 0 is 0, leave the
2 in that place: then lastly, 7 by 7 is 49, being the last number set down all
the 9 under 7, and the 4 one place more to the left hand, and the work will
then stand thus.

^

Secondly, cancel 7, and then say; 5 by 1 makes 5, place that 5 under the 0;
and then 5 by 0 is 0, place a 0 under the 5 in the next place; and then 5 by 5
is 25, set down 5, and carry 2: then 5 by 6 is 30, and 2 makes 32, set down
2, and carry 3: then 5 by 8 is 40, and 3 makes 43, place 3, and carry 4: also 5
by 2 is 10, and 4 makes 14, set down 4, and carry 1: then 5 by 3 is 15, and 1
makes 16, set down 6, and carry 1: then 5 by 0 is 0, set down the 1 there:
last of all, 5 by 7 is 35, set them all down, and the work will then stand
thus.

^

Thirdly, cancel the 5, and then say, 0 by 1 is 0, place a 0 under the 0 of
your multiplier, and the^ proceed to the next figure of your multiplier, which
is 2, saying, 2 by 1 is 2, place the 2 under the said 2 of your multiplier:
then 2 by 0 is 0, which set down: then 2 by 5, makes 10, set down a 0, and
carry 1: then 2 by 6 is 12, and 1 is 13, set down 3, and carry (...): also 2
by 8 is 16, and 1 is 17, set down 7, and carry 1: also by ^ is 4, and 1 makes
5, which set down: again, 2 by 3 is 6, which set down: lastly, by 7 is 14,
which set down, and the work will stand, as in this example.

^

Fourthly, cancel the 2, and say, 3 by 1 is 3, which place right under the
said 3: then 3 by 0 is 0, and work in all respects as before, and the work
being ended, will stand thus.

^

I will here add some few examples to be wrought by the pen, without any
troubling of the memory with bearing ought in mind.

Example. ^

2. Example. ^

The explanation of the work by the pen, without charging the memory.
The first example. ^

First, I multiply all the figures of my multiplicand by 7, the lowest figure of
my multiplier, saying, 7 by 8 is 56, put 6 under the 7, and 5 under the 8: then
7 by 6 is 42, leave the 2 under 5 last placed, and set the 4 one place more
toward the left hand under the 9: then 7 by 9 is 63, leave 3 under the 4 last
placed, and set 6 one place more to the left hand under 7: then 7 by 7 is 49,
leave 9 under the 6 last placed, and the 4, set one place more to the left hand
under the 8: lastly, 7 by 8, makes 56, leave 6 under the 4, and place 5 one
space more to the left hand, as before, then cancel 7 of your multiplier, and
the multiplication by the first figure is ended, and the work will stand thus.

Example. ^

Then for the second work, say, 8 by 8 is 64, place 4 under the said 8, and
put 6 under the next figure 3: then 8 by 6 makes 48, leave 8 under 6, and put 4
under the next 9: and so working in all respects as at the first, and your
second work will stand thus, as in this example.

^

Lastly, cancel 8 your multiplier, and then multiply by 9, as is before
taught, placing the first figure of your product under the figure multiplying,
and the work being ended, it will stand thus; and lastly, gathering the total
by addition, it is 86824416; as in this example.

^

There is no difficulty in this kind of working, but only when there falls a 0
in in the multiplicand, or multiplier; for if there be a cipher then you must
fill up the places as you work, either with pricks, or ciphers, as if you had
figures to set in their places, and the rest of the work is as before, is
taught in the third example; but I will here add one example, having all the
difficulties that may happen, for the better understanding hereof.

Example. ^

Example. ^

How to multiply, and to bring the product in the last line.
Place your numbers right one under the other, as in the common way; then make
a right line somewhat distant from the first numbers with your pen, as in the
example following.

^

Then begin and say, 7 by 8 is 56, place the 6 under the line under the 7, and
the 5 above the line in a smaller figure in the next place toward the left
hand: then 7 by 6 is 42, and the 5 above the line makes 47, leave 7 under the
8, and set the 4 again above the line: then 7 by 9 is 63, and the 4 above the
line makes 67, place 7 there, and set the 6 in the next place above the line:
then 7 by 7 is 49, and 6 above the line makes 55, leave 5 there, and put 5
again over the line: lastly, 7 by 8 makes 56, and the 5 last placed makes 61,
place that whole sum under the line, and the work will stand, as above in the
example.

Secondly, draw a line again a little disstant, as before from the last
product, as in the example following.

Example. ^

Then say, 8 by 8 is 64, and 7 makes 71, place 1 under the 7, and set 7 above
the line: then 8 by 6 is 48, and the two seauens between lines makes 62, place
2 under the 7, and set 6 again over the line: then 8 by 9 is 72, and 6 makes
78, and 5 makes 83, place 3 under the line, and 8 above the line; then 8 by 7
is 56, and 8 makes 64, and 1 makes 65; place 5 under the line, and set 6 above:
lastly, 8 by 8 is 64, and 6 makes 70, and 6 makes 76, place them both down;
and the work will stand as above in the example.

Thirdly, draw a line again, as before, a little distant from the last
product, as in this example.

Example. ^

Thirdly, say 9 by 8 is 72, and 2 makes 74, place 4, and put 7 over the line:
then 9 by 6 is 54, and 10 makes 64, place 4 under the line, and put 6 above:
then 9 by 9 is 81, and 11 above makes 92, leave 2 under the line, and 9 over
the line: then 9 by 8 is 63, and 15 makes 78, leave 8 under the line, and 7
above: lastly, 9 by 8 is 72, and 14 makes 86, place them both under the line,
and then bring down the two figures which are cut off by two right down
lines, which are 1 and 6, and the work is ended, and the work will stand, as
appears in the example above, and the total product is in the last line,
86824416; and this does not charge the memory, for all the figures are set down
in view, and to be seen at the first sight, and this is the second kind of
multiplication, without charging of the memory.

^

CHAP. V. Division.
SEt your Dividend, which is the number to be divided in the upper part, and
the Divisor next to the left hand, under the greatest figures in value of your
Dividend: If the upper numbers be greater then the lower, or else place your
divisor one place more toward your right hand, as in this example.

^

If you would divide 78567 by 84, place them as above; for because you cannot
have 8 out of 7 in the Dividend, therefore place your 8 one place more toward
the right hand, and the 4 next to it, and your quotient you must place at the
right side of your numbers behind a crooked line. But I will first give an
example of Division by one figure: I would divide 65490 pound amongst 5 men;
place your numbers thus.

Example. ^

First, I seek how often 5 is in 6, this I may have but once; then put 1 in the
quotient beyond the crooked line, and take 5 out of 6, and there will rest 1,
set that over 6, and then remove your divisor one place more to the right hand,
and then seek you how many times 5 may be had in 15, and the answer is,
thrice, therefore place; in the quotient, and by it multiply your divisor 5,
makes 15, which taken out of 15, leaves nothing, place a 0 over the 5, and
remove your divisor, and seek how ost you may have 5 in the 4 over it, but you
cannot have it once; wherefore put a 0 in the quotient, and remove your
divisor, and seek how many times you may have 5 in the figures over and behind
it, which are 49, and you may have it nine times, put 9 in the quotient, and by
it multiply your divisor 5, makes 45, which taken from 49, leaves 4, which
place above the 9. And lastly, remove again your Divisor 5 under the 0, and
seek how many times 5 is in 40, and you shall and it 8 times, place 8 in the
quotient, and by it multiply 5, makes 40 which taken from 40, leaves nothing
remaining and the work is ended, and will stand thus, as in the example, and I
find, if I divide 65490 pound amongst 5 men, every man shall have for his part
13098 pound.

^

And this is the order of Division for one figure: but if your Divisor do
consist of more figures then one, then you must take the first figure of your
Divisor no oftener out of the Dividend, then you can also take every several
figure of your Divisor, out of the same figures of the Dividend standing above
them, as for example.

If you would divide 86824416 by 987, which was one of the products of the
multiplications in the rules before going, for a trial of your former work,
then place your numbers, as in the example following.

Example. ^

Then I seek how often I may have 9 in 86, I find I may have it 9 times; but if
I consider the next figure 8 of my Divisor, I cannot have also 9 times 8 out of
the numbers remaining; if I take 9 times 9, which is 81, out of 86, there will
remain but 5; and then 9 times 8, the next figure of my divisor, makes 72,
which cannot be taken out of 58 which will remain; therefore I place 8 in the
quotient, and by that I multiply all the figures of my Divisor, 987 makes 7896,
which taken from 8682, leaves 786 above them: and the work will stand thus.

^

Secondly, I remove my Divisor 987 one place nearer the right hand, and then I
seek how often I may have 9 in 78, which I see I can have but 7 times, so I put
7 in the Quotient, and by that 7, I multiply my Divisor 987, makes 6909, which
taken from 7864, the numbers above them there will remain 955, and the work
will stand thus.

Example. ^

Thirdly, again I remove my divisor 987 one place nearer the right hand, and
seek how many times I may have 9 in 95, and I find I may have it 9 times,
which 9 I set into the Quotient, and by it multiply 987, makes 8883, which
taken from 9554 leaves 671, and the work will stand thus.

Example. ^

Fourthly, I remove my Divisor again, and seek how often I may have 9 in 67,
and I see I can have it but 6 times, then I put 6 in the quotient, and by it
multiply 987, makes 5922, which taken from 6711, leaves 789, and the work
will stand in the example following.

Example. ^

Lastly, I remove my Divisor again, and seek how often I may have 9 in 78, and
I find I may have it 8 times, which 8 I put into the quotient, and by it I
multiply my Divisor 987 makes 7896, equal unto the numbers above; and so being
taken away, leaves nothing remaining, and proves the multiplication to be truly
wrought, as appears in the example following.

Example. ^

The third Example of Division.
The second kind of Division is this: first, place your dividend and divisor as
in the former Examples, and then having found out the figure of your quotient,
begin with the least figure of your divisor toward the right hand first, and
multiply that by the figure of the quotient found, and then subtract the sum of
the multiplication of that figure from the figure above the same, if it exceed
not 9; but if the product be above 9, then for every 10 bear one in mind to
be added to the product of the multiplication of the second figure of your
Divisor by the quotient; and so in all respects work for every other figure,
and you shall need make no more figures above your Dividend then necessity
shall require, as for example.

I would divide the product of the multiplication in the former Chapter of
79648039 by 8976, which was found to be as follows, viz. 714920798064 by
8976: first, I place my Dividend and Divisor as follows.

^

Then first I seek how often I may have 8 in 71, I find by trial I can have
it but 7 times* then having placed 7 in the Quotient, I first multiply 6, the
least, or smallest figure in value by 7, makes 42; then I say, 42 from 42, rest
0, and carry 4 for the forty in mind; then I cancel the 2 over the 6, and
placea 0 in the room over it. Secondly, I say, 7 by 7 is 49, and 4 in mind
makes 53, from 59 leaves 6, and carry 5^ cancel the 9, and place 6 over it.
Thirdly, 7 by 9 is 63, and 5 in mind is 68, from 74 leaves 6, and carry 7,
cancel the 4, and place 6 above it: also 7 by 8 is 56, and 7 makes 63, which
taken from 71, leaves 8 remaining, which 8 place over the 1, and cancel the
71, and the first work will stand thus.

^

Secondly, I remove my Divisor 8976, and seek, how many times I may have 8 in
86, ^ find 9 times; then I multiply 6 by 9 placed in the Quotient, makes 54,
which taken from 60, leaves 6; place 6 above the first 0, and carry 6 for the
60: then say, 9 by 7 is 63, and 6 in mind makes 69, from 70 leaves 1, and carry
7 in mind; cancel the 0 over the 7, and place the 1 over the 0. Again, 9 by 9
is 81, and 7 in mind is 88, which taken from 96, leaves 8 to be placed above
the first 6, and carry 9 in mind: lastly, 9 by 8 is 72, and 9 makes 81, which
taken from 86, leaves 5 to be placed above the 6, and the work will stand as
follows.

Example. ^

Thirdly, again I remove my Divisor, and seek how many times 8 is in 58, and
I find I can have it but 6 times, which I place in the Quotient: then I say, 6
by 6 makes 36, from 37 leaves 1 above 7, and carry 3: then 6 by 7 is 42, and 3
is 45, from 46 leaves 1, above the 6, and carry 4: again, 6 by 9 is 54, and 4
makes 58, from 61 leaves 3 above the 1, and carry 6. Lastly, 6 by 8 is 48, and
6 makes 54, from 58 leaves 4, and the work stands thus, as in this example.

^

Fourthly, I remove my Divisor, and seek how often I may have 8 in 43, and I
find but 4 times, I place 4 in the Quotient. Then 4 by 6 makes 24, from 29,
leaves 5, and carry 2, set 5 over the 9: then 4 by 7 is 28, and 2 makes 30,
from 31, leaves 1, and carry 3. Again, 4 by 9 is 36, and 3 makes 39, from 41
leaves 2, and carry 4. Lastly, 4 by 8 is 32, and 4 is 36, from 43, leaves 7,
and the work will then stand thus.

Example. ^

Fifthly, I remove my Divisor, and seek how often I may have 8 in 72; I find 8
times, which placed in the quotient, I multiply 6 by 8, makes 48, from 48,
leaves 0, and carry 4^ then 8 by 7 makes 56, and 4 is 60, from 65 leaves 5, and
carry 6: then 8 by 9 is 72, and 6 makes 78, from 81, leaves 3, and carry 8:
then 8 by 8 makes 64, and 8, is 72, from 72 leaves 0 remaining, and the work
will stand thus.

Example. ^

Sixthly, I remove my Divisor, and seek how often I may have 8 in 3, which I
find not once; I place a 0 in the Quotient, and remove my Divisor one place
more and seek how many times 8 is in 35; I find I can have it but 3 times, I
place 3 in the Quotient beyond the 0 last placed, and say, 3 by 6 is 18, from
26 rests 8, and carry 2: then 3 by 7 is 21, and 2 is 23, from 30 leaves 7, and
carry 3: again, 3 by 9 is 27, and 3 is 30, from 30 leaves a 0, and carry 3:
also 3 by 8 is 24, and 3 is 27, from 35 leaves 8; and the work will stand thus.

Example. ^

Lastly, I remove my Divisor, and seek how often I may have 8 in 80; I find 9
times, I place 9 in the Quotient, and say, 9 by 6 is 54, from 54 leaves 0, and
carry 5: then 9 by 7 is 63, and 5 is 68, From 68 leaves 0, and carry 6: Then 9
by 9 is 81, and 6 is 87, from 87 leaves 0, and carry 8: last of all, 9 by 8 is
72, and 8 makes 80, from 80 there will remain nothing but ciphers, and the
work is quite ended, and will stand, as in the example following.

Example. ^

The fourth and last kind of Division, is the most absolute, speedy, and easy,
not charging the memory at all, with keeping any numbers in mind; and also the
proof of your work is made by Addition, and not by multiplication, as has
heretofore been commonly used, but the figures of your work are by Addition,
the proof of your work, as shall appear by examples following.

The third Work.
First, place your Dividend between two parallel lines, and your Quotient at
the right side of your Dividend, behind a crooked line, as before; then place
your Divisor next to the left hand of your Dividend, behind a perpendicular
line: and lastly, mark how many figures your Divisor has, and in the room of
those figures place ciphers under the figures of your Dividend, so many as your
Divisor has figures, as in the last example; which I will again repeat in
this place, and work it by this kind of Division, making the proof of the work
by Addition of the same figures.

Example. ^

First, I point to the first cipher toward the left hand, and seek how often I
may have 8, the greatest figure in value of my Divisor, having respect to the
other figures of my Divisor, to take them also as often, out of the figures
above, and I find I can have it but 7 times, which 7 I place in the Quotient,
and by that 7 I multiply my Divisor 8976, saying first, 7 by 6 is 42, place the
2 under the lowest cipher toward the right hand, and carry 4: then 7 by 7 is
49, and 4 is 53, set 3 under the next place to the left hand, and carry 5: then
7 by 9 is 63, and 5 is 68, place the 8 in the next place, and carry 6. Lastly,
7 by 8 is 56, and 6 in mind makes 62, which place down in their places, and
the total is 62832, to be subtracted from 71492, and there will remain 8660;
and the work will stand thus.

Example. ^

Secondly, I cancel the first cipher to the left hand, and place one cipher
more toward the right hand, under the 0, and then I point again to the first
cipher, and see how often I may have 8 in 86; I find 9 times, and placing 9 in
the Quotient, by it I multiply 8976 my Divisor, placing the lowest figure in
value under the lowest cipher to the right hand, and the rest in order, and I
find the product to be 80784, which taken from 86600, leaves 5816 remaining,
and then your work will stand, as in this.

Example. ^

Thirdly, I cancel my Divisor, or one Cipher, and place one cipher more under
7, and then seek how often I may have 8 in 58, which I find 6 times, and by it I
multiply my Divisor 8976 makes 53856, which taken from 58167, leaves 4311, and
the work will stand as follows.

Example. ^

Fourthly, I cancel one cipher, and place a cipher under 9, and then seek how
often I may have 8 in 43, which I find but 4 times, which place in the Quotient,
and by it I multiply my Divisor 8976, makes 35904, which taken from 43119,
leaves 7215.

Example. ^

Fifthly, I cancel one cipher, and place a cipher under 8, and fee^e how often ^
is in 72; ^ find 8 times, which placed in the Quotient, I multiply my Divisor
8976 by it makes 71808, which taken from 72158, leaves 350, and the work
stands, as in the example following.

Example. ^

Sixthly, I cancel one cipher, and place another under the 0, and seeking I
find I cannot have 8 in 3; therefore I place a 0 in the Quotient. Seventhly, I
cancel one cipher, and place one other under the 6, and seek how often I may
have 8 in 35; I find but 3 times, and placing 3 in the Quotient, by it I
multiply 8976, makes 26928, which taken from 35006, leaves remaining 8078.

Lastly, I cancel the next cipher, and do place another under the last figure
of my Dividend 4, and seek how often I may have 8 in 80; I find 9 times, and
then placing 9 in the Quotient, I multiply my Divisor 8976, and the Quotient is
80784, equal unto the numbers above, and so being subtracted from the numbers
above, leaves o remaining, and the work is ended, and will stand thus.

Example. ^

The proof of this Division is made by Addition of the figures, under the line
or Dividend, for if they return your former Dividend, the work is true
wrought; or otherwise be sure some error is in your work, if there remains any
fraction after your work is ended, then it is to be added into the lower
figures in their several places, as shall appear by examples following.

Here in this example following, working according to this latter form of
work, there is advantage to be taken; if the figures of the Quotient be well
noted, as here the fourth figure of the Quotient is 7, the Product of the
Divisor multiplied by it is 1438816, and also the eleventh figure of the
Quotient is 7, so that coming to multiply the Divisor again by that 7, I
need but take the Product of the first multiplication by 7, which is 1438816,
and so place them in their several places, as in the example, and so likewise
there is 3 in the Quotient two times, so that for the latter multiplication, I
take the first product 539556, and sa^e that labor of multiplication of the
Divisor by 3: and so of any other figure coming into the Quotient more times
then once, as by the example before going will appear.

Place the great example following, in this place.

How to divide by a Unite with Ciphers.
If you will divide by 10, or by 100, or 1000, or with any other unite with
ciphers, one or more; do but cut off so many figures from the right hand of
your Dividend, as there are ciphers in your Divisor, and the remains is your
Quotient.

Example.

If you would divide 786589 by 10, cut off the last figure 9, and the residue
is your Quotient 78658 2/10; or if you will divide by 100, cut off two figures,
and the Quotient will be 7865 ^2/100; or by 1000, and the Quotient will be 786
^^2/1000; and so of all other.

^

If you will divide the Product of 1999 squared; that is to say, multiplied in
it self, which is 3996001 by 1999, for expedition of work, after you have
found the first figure of the Quotient 1, and taken that out, I find the next
figure will be 9, which taken out, the third and fourth figures are also found
to be 9, and so you need not make multiplication for every several 9, but the
first will serve for all, as in the example following.

Brief Rules by Multiplication and Division.
If you multiply any number of nines; as if you will multiply, or square 5
times 9 by 5 times 9, then place your nines in this order following.

Example. ^

Then say, 9 times 9 is 81, place the 1 under the first 9 to the right hand,
and then subtract the 1 from the first 9 to the left hand, and add the ciphers
between, and the Product is ended, and is 9999800001, as appears.

The proof of the work after the ordinary way. ^

To multiply any number by 9.
Add a o to the number you intend to multiply, and then set the same numbers
under them, and subtract them from the uppermost, and the remains is the
Product of that multiplication by 9.

Example. ^

To multiply by, or, or, or.

If you will multiply 856 by 24, first, multiply 856 by 24, makes 20544; and
then for one half, take half 856, which is 428, and add into the former
sum, makes the total 20972.

Example. ^

What number is that, which being divided by 24, the Quotient will be 856.
Answer, multiply 856 by 24, makes 20544 for the number that you seek.

Example. ^

There is a plot of land containing 848 Perches, the one side is 24, what must
the other be. Answer, Divide 848 by 24, the Quotient is 35 for the other side.

^

If you will divide the Product of 5 times 9 squared, which is 9999800001, by 5
nines, then set the Divisor right underneath the Dividend, and add them
together, and cut off the 5 ciphers from the Product, and the residue is the
Quotient.

Example. ^

What number is that, which being multiplied by 15, the total will be 756.
Answ. divide 756 by 15, and the Quotient is 50 6/159, or 2/5, for the answer,
or number you do seek.

Example. ^

There are 825 men, to march 15 in one rank, how many files will they make.
Divide 825 by 15, it makes 55 files.

Example. ^

There is 948 pound of powder to be employed in an Assault of Battery with 6
pieces of Ordinance; the first piece shoots 4 pound, the second 5, the third
6, the fourth 7, the fifth 8, the sixth 10 pound, the question is, how many
Shootes each piece may make, to make an equal number of Shotts. Answer;
divide 948 by 40, and it makes 23 Shootes, and there will remain 28 pound.

THE RVLE OF REDVCTION.
TO reduce any great number into a smaller denomination it is done by
multiplication, and to reduce small denominations into greater it is done by
division: in this manner mark how many of the smaller denominations is
contained in one of the next greater, and by that number you must multiply the
greater: or of the contrary, if you would bring small denominations into
greater, mark how many of the smaller denominations makes one of the next
greater, and that number shall be your divisor.

Example.

If you would reduce pounds starling into pence, multiply your pounds by 240
pence, because so many pence makes pound starling, and the total will be the
number of pence in the sum of pounds given. And contrariwise, if you would
bring pence into pounds starling: divide your number of pence by 240 pence,
which are the pence in one pound, and the Quotient will show the number of
pounds, in the sum of pence given: but in this operation the Tables in the
beginning of this book will help much, for the speedy reducing of pounds,
shillings pence, yards, else, bushels, pecks, pints, etc. into smaller or
greater denominations; for if you search in the said Tables, you shall find your
multiplier, or diuider, whereby you are to multiply, or divide your number
given, to perform the work, as shall appear by the several examples
following.

Reduction of Coin.
In 87652 pound, how many pence: in the Table of Coin I find 240 pence makes

What Progression Arithmaticall is, and the Rule.
PRogression Arithmeticall is nothing else but a brief summing, colecting, or
gathering together of diverse numbers, increasing by equal proportion, into one
total sum. As for example: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. etc. or also, 3.
4. 5. 6. 7. 8. etc. or, 2. 4 6. 8. 10, 12. etc. or else by 3, as, 5. 8. 11. 14
17. 20. 23. 26. etc. or of all such like kinds of Progrission, which do
increase equally by 2. 3. 4. 5, or 6, or any other greater increase, and such
kind of Progression is called, Arithmeticall.

2. To find the sum of a Progression.
Mark first how many several places there be in your Progression, and note
that down; then add the first number of the Progression to the last: then
multiply half those two numbers by the whole number of the places, or else
half the number of the places, by the whole number of the first and last term
added into one sum, and both ways will produce the total sum of that
Progression.

Example.

There is a Progression beginning at 4, and is continued unto 44, increasing by
4. First, set down the numbers of that Progression, beginning at 4, and ending
at 44.

Terms. 4. 8. 12. 16. 20. 24. 28. 32. 36. 40. 44. Places. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.
8. 9. 10. 11.

Here the first term is 4, and the last is term is 44, which added together,
makes 48, the one half, which is 24, multiplied by a 11, the whole number of
places makes 264 the total.

Example. ^

First Question.
A certain man gave to his daughter in marriage the first day of January 1
pound, and the second day 2 pound, the third day 3 pound and so increasing
every day 1 pound, until 31 days were expired; the question is, what he
should receive in the whole sum. First, 31 days is the number of places, and
31 li. is the last payment: add the first term 1 to the last term 31, makes
32; which multiplied by 15 one half, which is half 31; or take 31 and half
32, and the product will be the total Sum of his wives portion.

How to find the latter term of a Progression.
If you would know the latter term of a Progression of 100 terms, increasing
by 3, and beginning at 10; take one term from 100 terms, and there will
remain 99; which multiply by 3, the excess or difference of the increase,
makes 297; to the which if you add the first term 10, makes 307 for the 100
term of that Progression.

Example. ^

Or otherwise take the Excess 3 from the first term 10, and there will rest
7, which note a part, then multiply, the number of places 100 by the excess 3,
makes 300; to which add the 7, makes 307, as before.

Example. ^

Second Question.
A certain Merchant bought 78 pieces of Exetor Carsies, to pay 2 shillings for
the first piece 4 shillings, for the second 6 shilling, for the third, 8 s. and
so forth increasing his price unto 78 pieces, 2 shillings in every piece; the
question is, what the Clothier had for his Carseys.

First, find the latter term, taking one from 78, makes 77; which multiply by
2, makes 154; to which add the first term 2, makes 156 for the 78, or last
term: then add 2, the first term, to 156, the last, makes 158; which
multiply by 39, half of the number of places, makes 6162 shillings for the
sum of money, the Clothier shall receive for his 78 Carseys.

Example. ^

To find the number of terms.
There is a Progression, whose first term is 2, the last term, 156; and the
excess was 2, I would find the number of terms.

Subtract the first term from the last, and divide the remayner by the
excess, the quotient is the number of terms, wanting but one. Example: 2, the
first term from 156, the last leaves 154; which divided by 2, makes 77; to
which add 1, makes 78, the number of terms.

^

How to find the Excess, or difference.
Subtract the first term from the last, and divide the remainer by one less,
then the number of the Terms, and the Quotient will be the Excess or
difference.

Example.

Subtract 10, the first term, from 307 the last term, there will remain 297;
which divide by 99, one less then the number of terms, which are 100, makes 3
the excess.

^

To find any middle term.
Subtract a unite from the number of the term you would know, and multiply the
remainer by the difference, and to that product add the first term, and the
total is the term you do seek.

Example.

To find the 30 term in the last example of 100 terms, subtract 1, rests 29;
which multiply by 3, the Excess makes 87; to which add the first term 10,
makes 97 for the 30 term of that Progression.

Example. ^

How to find what number shall begin and finish a Progression.
To the number of terms add one, which multiply by half the number of
terms, and by the product divide the sum of the progression, and the quotient
will be the first term, and excess of that progression.

Example.

At 16 payments 353 pound, 12 shillings is to be paid, the question is, what
number must begin, and continue the progression.

First, the money 7072 shillings; then to 16, the number of terms, add 1,
makes 17; which multiply by 8, half the number of terms, makes 136 for
Divisor; by which divide 7072, and the quotient is 52 shillings for the first
payment and excess, and by the same the other payments are found.

Example. ^

Example. ^

What Geometrical Progression is, and the Rule.
THe terms being 3, to find a third proportional between two extremes:
divide the Root of the greater by the lesser extreme, and the quotient is
your desire.

Example.

First, 8 and 12 are two extremes given, it is required to find a
proportional number between those two numbers given; square 12, it is 144,
which divide by 8, makes 18 for the third proportional number. Secondly,
multiply your extremes together, and extract the square root for the mean
proportional, between two numbers given; as let 4 and 9 be two extremes, 4
by 9 is 36, the square root is 6, for a mean proportional number to those
two numbers given.

Between 2 and 54, let 2 mean proportionals be desired by the square of 2,
which is 4; multiply 54, it makes 216, the Cube root whereof is 6 for the
least of the two Means: Again, by 2 multiply 2916, which is the square of 54,
makes 5832, of which the Cube root is 18, for the greater mean proportional
sought. But if the terms exceed 4, having all one excess, it is then called
Geometrical Progression.

To find any middle Term, or any other Term in a Geometrical Progression.
Increase your Progression by the excess, and the square of the term when you
cease, or the number multiplied in it self squarely, is the double of your
Term save 1, if the progression begin with an unite.

But it the first term be not an unite, then the square of any term is the
double number of the said term: as if you should square the sixth term, then
the product would be the twelfth term: and so of any other term.

Example.

A Gentleman coming into a Market to buy a Horse, was asked 30 pounds for him.
Nay (said the Gentleman) his price is over great. Then said the owner (having
more craft and subteltie then the Gentleman, as commonly the old Proverb is
true amongst Horse-coursers); My Gelding ha^h four shoes upon his four feet
(quoth he), you shall give me for the first nail (there being 28 in all) one
farthing* and for the second nail 2 farthings, and for the third 4 farthings,
and for the fourth 8 farthings; and so double at every nail, you shall have
him. Whereat the Gentleman smiled, saying; I will have him. And so they
bargained, and then went to an Arithmatician to cast up the Sum: but how this
Gentleman was able to pay for this Horse, shall appear by the Work, which I
have put for an example, because I would not have any man ignorant in
Arithmatick, to make any such blind matches without advice, as I know many have
done to their cost.

1. Example.

Now according to the rule, I increase this progression unto the seventh Term
thus, 1. 2. 4. 8. 16. 32. 64; which 64 I multiply by it self squarely, the
product is 4096, which by the rule is the thirteenth Term, which is one Term
less then the double of 7: then multiply that 4096 by 2, it makes 8192, which
is the fourteenth Term. Then multiply 8192 by 8192, and the product is
67108864, which is the twenty seventh Term: the which being doubled, makes
the last Term 134217728.

Example. ^

The Extremes and Excess of a Progression given to find the sum.
Multiply the last term by the Excess, and from the Product abate the first
term, and divide the remayner by a unite less then the excess, and the
Quotient is the sum of the Progression desired.

Example.

In the last examples, the excess was 2, by which I multiply 134217728, and
the Product is 268435456, from which abate 1, the first term, and the remayner
is 268435455, which should be divided by one unite less then the excess,
which is 2, and ^ less is but 1; therefore seeing 1 does neither multiply, nor
divide, I conclude the price of the horse to be 268435455 farthings; which I
divide by 960, the farthings in one pound starling, and the quotient is ^79620
pound, 5 shillings, 3 pence, 3 farthings, the price of the Horse, as in this
example.

Example. ^

I have inserted in the next page the trial of this work, by increasing the
Terms from 1 to 28, and also the Addition of the total, which shows the
answer to be true.

Example. 1 1 2 2 4 3 8 4 16 5 32 6 64 7 128 8 256 9 512 10 1024 11 2048 12
4096 13 8192 14 16384 15 32768 16 65536 17 131072 18 262144 19 524288 20
1048576 21 2097152 22 4194304 23 8388608 24 16777216 25 33554432 26 67108864 27
134217728 28 268435455 The Total.

Otherwise, subtract the first term from the last, and divide the remayner by
one ace less then the Excess, and to the quotient add the last Term, and
the total is the sum.

Example.

To 12 men a sum of money is given to the eldest, to the second, the
remayner, and so to every one of the rest, and the last portion was found to
be 4 pound, and the last half being also 4 pound, was given to a friend to
see the money to be equally distributed; what was each man's portion, and the
sum given?

Let 4 be the last portion, and twelfth Term, and so double until you come
to the first term, and you shall find every man's portion Then by this second
rule, you shall find the total to be 16380 pound; to which add the Ezecutors
part 4 pound, makes 16384 pound.

3. Example.

A Gentleman bought a Manor, with all the appurtenances for a sum of money
unknown; but he was to pay at several days of payment by continual
triplation, of every payment, from the first payment which was 4 pound, and the
last 8748 li. the question is, what he paid for the said Manor and lands.

Example.

Subtract the first term 4, from the last term 8748, there will remain 8744;
which divide by the Excess, one less, viz by 2, and the quotient will be
4372; to the which add the latter term 8748, and the total is 13120 pound,
for the sum which the said Manor and lands cost.

Fractions.
YOu shall understand, that in the work of Fractions hereafter; in the next
page following I have used another form of working, then heretofore has been
used: as when you will set forth any fraction, as thus heretofore used, set
the^ out thus, 34; or, place thus 78 with a double prick between them: and so
of any other, as 25/20 of a pound, thus, 1520 of one pound: or fractions of
fractions, thus, of of of a pound, set them thus, 23 of 34 of 56 of a pound:
and so of all other fractions, as shall appear afterward in the operations
following; and so being placed, they are more apter and fitter for all the
several operations of Arithmatick, then being placed after the ordinary form
of working. And thus much I thought good to express for the better
understanding of the Rules hereafter following, in all fractionall operations.
And now I will proceed unto the several rules of Fractions, with their
Examples.

How to reduce Fractions of Fractions. First Rule.
Multiple their topps one into another for a new numerator, and likewise their
Basses for a new denominator, and the work is ended.

Example.

If you would reduce 34 of 23 of 78 of one li starling; multiply 3 by 2, makes
6, and then 6 by 7 makes 42 for the new numerator to your fraction: then 4 by 3
makes 12, and 12 by 8 makes 96 for new denominator, and the fraction is 4296 of
a pound.

34 of 23 of 78 of 1 li. makes 4296 of a li.

2. Example.

Again, 35 of 98 of 710 of 1112 of a pound, makes 20794800.

^

3. Example.

What is 12 of 23 of 34 of 45 of 56 of 67 of one pound. Answer: cross all the
by as equal terms, and set the unequal terms 17 of a pound for the total
sum: but after the other form of work, it would have brought out 7205040 of
a pound, which by abreuiation makes 17

The Proof.

72504, 36252, 18126, 963, 321, 17.

2. Rule: How to reduce Fractions of Integers.
Multiply all the Denominators of your several fractions for the new, or
common Denominator to all your given fractions.

Then to find new numerators to each of your given fractions; multiply each
fractions top into the basses, of each several fraction, excepting his own
basse, for the new numerators, as in this Example.

Example.

If you would reduce 34 and 56 and 78 of a pound into one Denomination:
multiply all the basses together, saying; 4 by 6 makes 24, and 24 by 8 makes
192 for the common Denominator to all the given fractions.

Then multiply 3, the numerator of the first fraction, by 6, the denominator of
the second fraction, makes 18, and 18 by 8 makes 144 for his numerator.

Secondly, multiply 5, the numerator of the second fraction by 4 and 8, the
Denominators of the other two fractions, makes 160 for the new Numerator of the
second fraction.

Thirdly, multiply 7, the numerator of the third fraction, by 6 and 4, makes
168.

Example. ^

2. Example.

If you would reduce 23, and 35, and 89 of a pound.

3. Example.

If you would reduce 78, 13, 23, 45, and 67 of a pound*

How to prove a Fraction by the known parts of Coin.
In the first example of fractions of fractions, I find that 34 of 23 of 78 of
a pound Sterling to be 4296 parts of a pound: for trial whereof, take 78 of a
pound, which is 17 shillings 6 pence, or 210 pence, the 23 of that number is
140 pence; and ^^4 of 140 pence is 105 pence: now multiply 42 the numerator of
your fraction by 240 d. and divide by 96, the denominator, makes 105 pence, the
proof, as follows.

4. Example. ^

2. Example.

In the first example of fractions of integers, there was 34, 56 and 78 of a
pound, reduced into one denomination, and the total by Addition was 472192 of
a pound. Now for the proof of the work, multiply the numerator 472 by 240,
makes 113280; which divided by 192 the denominator, makes 590 pence; which
divided by 12. pence, makes 2 pound, 9 shillings, 2 pence. The proof of this
trial in the parts of a pound, take first for 34 of a pound, or 15 shillings;
then 56 of a pound is 16 shillings 8 pence; also 78 of a pound is 17 shillings
6 pence; and the total added together, is 2 pound, 9 shillings, 2 pence, which
proves the work to be true.

Example. ^

3. Rule. Addition in Fractions.
If your fractions be of one denomination, then add all your numerators
together, subscribing the common denominator under the line.

Example. ^

The second Rule.

If your Fractions be not of one denomition, then reduce them by the second
rule of Reduction to one denomination, and then add them into one sum
subscribing under the common denominator.

Example. ^

If you would add 4080, 30200, and 5090; cut off a cipher from each numerator
and denominator, and the fractions remaining will be of the same with the given
fractions, and then work as before.

Example. ^

The proof of Addition by parts of Coin.
In the second Example, 23, 34, and 45 of a pound, are found to be 13360;
therefore divide 133 by 60, makes 2 pound and 1360 or 13 groats remaining, which
is 2 pound, 4 shillings, 4 pence.

The proof: add 23 of a pound, which is 13 shillings, 4 pence; and 34 of a
pound, which is 15 shillings, and 45 of a pound, which is 16 shillings, into
one total, makes 2 pound, 4 shillings, 4 pence, as before.

Example. ^

Rule 4. Subtraction in fractions.
As before in Addition, so also in Subtraction, reduce your fractions to one
common denomination, then subtract the smaller numerator from the greater, and
subscribe the common denominator under the remainer.

1. Example.

If you will subtract 34 from 74, there will remain 44, or one integer.

Also, 712 from 1312, leaves 612, or 12 remaining. But if you will subtract 23
from 78, then reduce them to one denomination, by the second rule of Reduction,
and work, as in this example.

Example. ^

2. Example.

Again, 38 from 1516, leaves 72128, remains.

^

The proof of Subtraction by the parts of Coin.
In the example before, where I take 23 from 78, the remayner was 524 of a
pound, which is 5 times 10 pence, or 4 shillings 2 pence. Also for proof, take
13 shillings 4 pence, which is 23 of a pound, from 78, which is 17 shillings 6
pence, there will remain 4 shillings 2 pence, as before.

Rule 5. Multiplication in Fractions.
Multiply Numerator by Numerator, and Denominator by Denominator, to make the
new Numerator, and new Denominator, and the work is ended.

1. Example.

If you will multiply 23, by 34, the product of that multiplication will be
612, or 12

^

The proof of Multiplication by the parts of Coin.
In the first example, 23 is multiplied by 34, and the product makes 612 of a
pound or 10 shillings: for proof whereof, multiply 13 shillings 4 pence, or
160 pence, which is 23 of a pound by 15 shillings, or 180 pence, which is 34 of
a pound, and the product will be 28800, which being divided by 240 pence, the
pence in one pound will yield in the quotient 120 pence, or to shillings.

Example. ^

6. Rule. Division in Fractions.
Multiply the numerator of the dividend by the denominator of the divisor for a
new numerator; and secondly the denominator of the dividend by the numerator of
the divisor, for new denominator, and the division is ended: or otherwise place
your dividend first above, and the divisor underneath, after my manner, and
multiply cross, and place them ^^ in these examples.

If you will divide 612 by 23, which was the product of 23 by 34 in the last
example, then it will bring out 1824, or 34, the other number, which proves
the work good.

1. Example. ^

If the denominators of the fractions be both alike, then divide their
numerators one by another; as 2732 divided by 332, makes the quotient to be
932, or Integers.

Example. ^

If the numerators be alike, then set the denominator of the divisor above,
the denonominator of the dividend, as 34 by 38, makes the quotient 84, or two
Integers, and contrariwise 38 by 34, makes the quotient 48, or 12

Example. ^

The proof of Division by the parts of Coin.
In the second of the first example, where I divide 23 by 45, the quotient is
1012, which in coin is 16 shillings 8 pence: for proof, I do multiply 23 of a
pound, which is 160 pence, by 240, makes 38400; which divide by 45, or 192
pence, makes 200 pence, which is 16 shillings 8 pence, the proof.

Example. ^

7. Rule. How to work whole numbers with Fractions.
If you would add, subtract, multiply, or divide whole numbers with fractions,
set the whole numbers fraction wise, and put 1 after for denominator, and then
work as in the Rules before, as if they were all fractions, and no whole
numbers.

Example.

If you will add 331 with 134, multiply the numerator 33 of your whole number,
by the Denominator of your fraction 4, makes 1324, which add unto 134, makes
the total 1454

^

2. Example.

If you will subtract 134 from 331, reduce them, and subtract 13 from 132, rest
1194

^

Example.

If you will multiply 331 by 134; multiply the numerators, 33 by 13, makes 429;
to the which subscribe the Denominator 4, makes 4294

^

4. Example.

If you will divide 331 by 134, multiply cross 33 by 4, makes 132, to be set
above; then 13 by 1 makes 13 for denominator.

^

8. Rule. How to work whole numbers and fractions with fractions.
Reduce your whole numbers into fractions in multiplying your whole number by
the denominator of your fraction; and unto that product add the numerator of
your fraction, and subscribe the old denominator.

1. Example.

If you will multiply 28 34 by 35 reduce 28 34 into fourths in multiplying by
the fractions denominator 4, saying, 28 by 4 makes 112, to the which add the
numerator of your fraction 3, makes 115; which multiplied by 35, makes 34520

^

If you will divide 28 34 by 35; reduce them as before, and then multiply them
cross, makes 1154 by 35, is 57512

Example. ^

9. Rule. How to Abreuiate a fraction.
Take one half of the numerator, and 12 of the denominator, as often as you may
until the lowest numbers in value of your fractions comes to be primes
together, which are such numbers, as cannot be abreuiated no lower.

Example.

In the first example of fractions of fractions, the fraction was 72504, which
was abreuiated unto 17 of a pound: first, take half the numerator 72, which is
36, then half the Denominator 504, which is 252; then 12 of 36, is 18; and 12
of 252 is 126. Again, 12 of 18 is 9, and 12 of 126 is 63; then I see I cannot
take 12 of the remainer, wherefore I see I may abreuiate them by 3 still,
saying, the third part of 9 is 3, and 13 of 63 is 21: lastly, 13 of 3 is 1, and
13 of 21 is 7, which place thus, 17* so that I find by abreuiation that 72504
of a pound, is one seventh part of a pound.

Example.

72504 36252 18126 963 321 17

If you cannot take half the numbers, then mark whether they will abreuiate by
3 4, or 5, or any other number under 9; as for example, I would abreuiate
92144, I see I may abreuiate both by 4; then taking 92, divide by 4, makes 23,
and 144 by 4 makes 36, total 2336 etc.

If you will abreuiate, 375625 of a pound, you may easily see, they will be both
abreuiated by 5: wherefore divide the numerator and denominator both by 5, as
o^t as you can, until they become primes together, and you shall find the
value of that fraction to be 35 of one pound, or 12 shillings.

Example. ^

10. Rule. How to find the value of any Fraction.
Multiply the numerator of your fraction by the parts contained in the whole,
and divide that product by the old Basse, and the quotient will be the value
of that fraction in the known parts of Coin.

Example.

If you would know what 2432 parts of a pound is in Coin: multiply your
numerator 24 by 240, the pence in one pound, makes 5760; which divided by 32,
the denominator, makes 180 pence, or 15 shillings, the true value of that
fraction.

Example.^

What is 343522 parts of a yard, multiply 343 by 16, the number of nails in
one yard makes 5448; which divide by 522, makes 10 nails, and 268522 parts of
a nail.

Example. ^

11. Rule. How to change the Surname of a Fraction.
Multiply the numerator of your fraction by the parts, or new Surname of that
you would change your fraction into, and divide by your denominator, and the
quotient will be your desire.

1. Example.

I have 3241620 parts of a year, which I would convert into days; I multiply
324 by 365, the number of days in one year, makes 118260; which divided by
1620, makes 73 days, the value of that fraction.

Example.^

I would change 2565292 parts of a pound into pence; multiply the numerator 756
by 240 pence, makes 181440, which divide by the denominator 5292, and the
quotient is 34 pence 15125292

Example.^

12. Rule. Questions of Fractions.
What number is that to the which if you do add 34, the total will be 56 of
a pound. Answer; reduce them to one denomination, and they are for 34 of a
pound 1824, and the 56 are 2024, from which subtract 18, rest 224 of a pound,
or 20 pence: the proof, take 3*4 of a pound, which is 15 shillings, and add
20 pence to it, and the total is 16 shillings, 8 pence; which is 56 of a pound.

Example.^

2. Example.

What number is that, from which if you do subtract 812, the remayner will be
610. Answer, reduce them, and add them both into one total, makes 152120 of
a pound for the number you do seek.

The proof in coin; 152120 of a pound is 304 pence, and 812 of a pound is 160
pence, which taken from 304, leaves 144 pence remaining, which is 610 of a
pound, or 12 shillings, as appears by the work.

^

What number is that, which being multiplied by 35, the product will be 920.
Answer divide 920 by 35, and the quotient is 4560, or 34. For the proof,
multiply 108 pence, which is 910 of a pound, by 240, the product is 25920;
which divide by 144, or 35, which is 12 shillings, makes 180 pence, or 34 of a
pound.

3. Example.

^

Example.

What number is that, which being divided by 78, the quotient will be 4*5.
Answer, multiply 78 by 45, the product is 2840, or 710, which makes 14
shillings.

The proof in Coin; 78, which is 210 pence, by 45, which is 192 pence, and
the product is 40320; which divide by 240, makes 168 pence, or 14 shillings:
behold the example following.

Rules of Practice.
Rules of Practice by the first Table.
TO work by the Aliquot parts of a pound, search in the first Table for your
given price, and by that number found, divide your number given, and the
quotient is your answer in pounds, and the remayner is the fraction of one
pound.

But if the given price be not found exactly at the first entrance, then find
2, or more numbers, to make the given price, and then work as follows.

Example.

If one yard cost 3 shillings 4 pence, what will 7859 yards cost at that rate:
I enter the Table, and against 3 shillings 4 pence, I find 16 of a pound;
wherefore I divide 7859 by 6, makes 1309 pound, 56 of one pound, or 16
shillings 8 pence.

At 16 pence an ell, what will 8976 else cost, I find for 16 pence my divisor,
to be 15, and so dividing 8976 by 15, the quotient is 598 pound, 6: 15, or 2:
5, which is 8 shillings.

Example. ^

Add a Cipher to your number given, and the last figure of your quotient will
be primes, every one in value 2 shillings, and the remainer is the fraction of
a prime, always less then 2 shillings. In the first example, the remainer was
5: 6 of one pound, but if you add a cipher, the quotient will be 1309 pound, 8
primes or 16 shillings, and the remayner is 2: 6 of one prime, or 1: 3, which
is 8 pence.

^

At 2 shillings 6 pence a pound pepper, what will 2436 pound cost: find 2
shillings, 6 pence 1: 8 of a pound, wherefore add a cipher, and divide, by 8,
makes 304 pound; 10 shillings.

^

At 8 pence a pound Ginger, will 77856 pound cost; divide by 30, adding a
cipher, makes 2595 pound, 2 primes, or 4 shillings.

^

At 17 pence a pound Sugar; what shall 23459 pounds cost: for 12 pence, divide
by 20, makes 1172 pound, 9 primes, 1: 2, or 19 shillings: then for the rest of
your given price, which is 5 pence; take 48, and divide, and the quotient is
488 pound, 7 primes, which added together into one sum, makes the total 1661
pound, 13 shillings, 7 pence.

Example. ^

At 6 shillings 8 pence a pound Cloves, what will 3769 pound wait cost: divide
by 3, makes 1256 pound, 3 primes, 1: 3, or 6 shillings 8 pence.

^

At 22 pence an elle of Holland, what 3768 else cost: for 20 pence divide by
12, makes 314 pound, and for 2 pence by 120, makes 31 pound, 4 primes, or 8
shillings; the total is 345 pound, 8 shillings.

^

If one elle of Holland cost 20 pence, how many else shall I buy for 345
pound: multiply 345 by the price, which is ^:12, or by 12, makes 4140 else,
the sum desired.

^

If one elle of Ozenbrigs cost 8 pence, what sum of else will 78 pound buy
me: multiply by 30, makes 2340 else.

^

At 15 pence an elle of Canuas, how many else will 100 pound buy: multiply by
16, makes 1600 else.

If one elle of parchment lace cost 1 penny, how many else shall I have for 73
pound: multiply by 240, makes 17520 else.

Example. ^

If one Acre of land be 5 shillings, how many Acres may I hire for 132 pound:
multiply by 4; makes 528 Acres.

^

Rules of Practice by the second Table.
If the price given be any number of shillings, search in the second Table for
the price given, and by the number there found: multiply your number of yards,
else, pounds or pieces, and cut off the last figure with a dash of the pen
for primes, every one in value 2 shillings, and the product is the sum of
pounds and shillings that your given number will cost.

Example.

At 2 shillings an elle of Holland, what will 956 else cost: in the second
table ^ find the tenth of the number given, so that if you take the tenth of
956, it is 95 pound, 12 shillings, only by cutting off the last figure by a
dash of the pen.

956 else at 2s. an ell, makes 956, or 12s.

At 7 shillings an ell of Cambricke, what will 789 else cost: multiply by 3
12, or take half of the given number, and multiply the whole number given, by
3, makes in one sum, cutting off the prime line, 276 pound, 3 shillings.

Example. ^

At 25 shillings a piece Raysons, what will 356 pieces cost: take always half
the number of shillings of your given price for your multiplier, and work as
before, and the product is 456 poued, 0 prime.

Example. ^

Also 75032 pieces at 26 shilling a piece.

^

If one barrel of Soap cost 47 shillings, what will 3584 barrels cost:
multiply by 23 12, makes 8422 pound, 8 shillings.

Example. ^

At 3 pound 6 shillings a Barrel, what will 124 cost.

^

If one Acre of land cost 6 pound 8 shillings, what will 758 Acres cost:
multiply by 64 shillings, which is half the price, the product is 4851 pound,
4 shillings, or two primes.

^

How to prove the last question, or any other of like kind. If one Acre of land
cost 6 pound 8 shillings, how many Acres shall be bought for 4851 pound, 4
shillings: divide your number of pounds and shillings by one half of the
number of shillings in the price given, adding a cipher to your number of
pounds, and the quotient is the number of Acres of land the said sum will buy
at that rate.

Example.

The given sum is 4851 pound, 2 primes, or 4 shillings; which divided by half
the given price, which is 64 shillings, brings into the quotient 758 Acres: and
so of any other sum.

^

A Merchant bought Cambricks, cost him 855 pound, 18 shillings; the question
is, how many pieces he had, paying for every piece 27 shillings. Answer, ad^e
a cipher to your number given, which 855 pound, 9 primes, makes 85590; which
divide by half the price given, which is 13 12; or divide by 135 the quotient
will be 634 pieces: now the reason wherefore a cipher is added to the number
given, having 9 primes in it is, because I divide by 13 12, which has one
fraction; and this rule is general.

Example.

What cost 634 pieces, at 27 shillings.

^

How to prove one question in the Rules of Practice, by working of another.
If you will prove any question in the rules of Practice, by a second example
mark the complement, or want of your given price from one pound, and work the
same number at that price which does want, and the total of those two sums
added together, makes the just number of pounds of the given sum.

Example.

At 16 shillings a piece of Fustian, what will 320 pieces cost. Answer;
multiply by 8, makes 256 pound, 0 prime.

Again, 16 shillings your given price wanted 4 shillings of one pound,
wherefore work 320 at 4 shillings, which is multiplied by 2 primes, makes 64
pound, 0 prime, the total is 320 pound, which proves the former work.

^

Example.

At 13 shillings a piece of Lawne, what will 752 pieces cost: 752 by 6 12,
makes 488 pound, 8 primes.

At 7 shillings a piece, what 752 pieces: 752 by 3 12, makes 263 pound, 2
primes, total is 752 pound.

Divide the number of else, yards, pounds, or pieces given by the number, or
numbers found in the third Table, always cutting the last figure for primes;
if that any remain after Division, it is always less then one prime, or 2
shillings.

Example.

At 3 pence a pound Licoras, what will 123728 pound cost. Answer; for 3 pence
in the third Table, I find my Divisor to be 8, by which I divide my given
number, makes 1546 pound, 6 primes, or 12 shillings.

^

At 9 pence the pound Ginger, what will 8768 pound cost: for 6 pence divide by
4, makes 219 li. 2 primes; then for 3 pence the residue of the price, divide by
8, makes 109 pound, 6 primes, total is 328 pound, 16 shillings. Or otherwise,
divide by 4 for 6 d. and then take half that product for 3 pence, and add them
into one sum, as before.

Example. ^

At 11 pence the yard Canuas, what will 2356 cost: for 8 pence divide by 3,
makes 78 pound, 5 primes, 13 or 8 pence; and for 3 pence, divide by 8, makes 29
pound, 4 primes, 12, or 12 pence; the total is 107 pound, 19 shillings, 8
pence.

^

A second example, the proof of the last.

At 13 pence a pound fine Sugar, what will 2356 pound cost: for 12 pence divide
by 2, makes 117 pound, 8 primes, or 16 shillings; then for 1 penny, divide by
24, makes 9 pound, 8 primes, 4 pence, the total is 127 pound, 12 shillings, 4
pence; which added to the former sum in the last example, makes 235 pound, 12
shillings; and so much will 2356 pound cost at 2 shillings a pound, because the
two given prices make one prime, or 2 shillings.

Example. ^

At 16 pence a pound Sugar, what will 78432 pound cost: work for 8 pence, and
double the sum, makes 5228 pound, 8 primes, or 16 shillings.

At 8 pence a pound Almonds, what will 78432 pound cost: divide by 3, ma es
2614 pound, 4 primes, or 8 shillings: which added with the former example,
makes 7843 pound, 2 primes, which is the price that 78432 pound will cost at 2
shillings a pound, and proves both examples true.

Example. ^

At 18 pence a pound Comfits, what will 78432 pound cost: for 12 pence take
half the given number, and for 6 pence take half of that sum, which added
into one total, makes 5882 pound, 4 primes.

^

At 6 pence a pound small Ginger, what will 78432 li. cost: divide by 4, makes
1960 li. 8 primes, or 16 shillings; which added to 5882 pound, 8 shillings,
makes 7843 pound 2 primes, the price at two shillings.

^

These tables may serve also, if the price be above 2 shillings, or one prime:
as if you shall say at 3 shillings, 6 pence an ell, what 782 else: here I see
the given price is compounded of 7 times 6 pence; wherefore I work first for 6
pence in dividing by 4, makes 19 pound, 11 pence; which multiply by 7, makes
136 pound, 17 shillings for the price of 782 else at 3 shillings, 6 pence the
elle.

At 6 pence an elle, what 782 else: find for 6 pence, 19 pound 11 shillings,
which added to the former sum in the last example, makes 156 pound, 8
shillings, which is the sum that 782 else will cost at 4 shillings the elle.

Example. ^

At 4 shillings 8 pence the elle Holland, what will 2148 else cost. I find 4
shillings 8 pence to be 14 Groats, so dividing by 6 for one Groat, makes 35
pound, 8 primes; which multiply by 14, makes 501 pound, 4 shillings.

^

At 15 pence a groce of points, what will 2256 gross cost. 15 Pence is 5 times
3 d. and so I divide 2256 by 8, makes 28 pound, 2 primes; which multiply by 5,
makes 141 pound.

^

Rules of Pr^^^ice by the fourth Table.
If the number of the price given be any Aliquot part of a shilling: enter the
fourth Table, and there you shall find a Divisor, by the which if you divide
your number given, the Quotient will be shillings, and the remainer parts of
one shilling. Then to convert your shillings into pounds, take one half of the
Quotient, cutting off the lower number for shillings, and the rest is pounds.

Example.

At 3 far things a pound prunes, what will 756 pound wait cost. Search in the
fourth Table, and you shall find 16 for your Divisor: by the which if you
divide 756, the Quotient is 47 shillings, 14, or 3 pence.

^

At 1 half penny a pound Coporas, what will 8756 pound cost. Divide by 24
makes 364 shillings, of which the one half cutting of the 4 shillings, is 18
pound 4 shillings; and 20 half pence remaining, total is 18 pound, 4
shillings, 10 pence.

^

At 4 pence a pound Licoras, what will 789 pound cost. Divide by 3, makes 13
pound, 3 shillings.

Again, at 6 pence a pound, what will 8579 pound cost. Divide by 2, makes 214
pounds, 9 shillings, 6 pence.

General Rules of Practice without Tables.
Multiply your number given by the sum of pence, that one yard, piece, pound,
or elle does cost, and the product will be the sum of pence, the whole number
given will cost; and then divide that sum of pence by 4, ma* es the Quotient
Groats, and if any reremaine, they are pence, always less then 4 pence, or
one Groat: and secondly again, divide that Quotient will be pounds and
primes, every prime in value 2 shillings, and the remains is Groats, always
less then 6 Groats, or one prime, which is value 2 shillings.

At 17 pence an ell Canuas, what will 3245 else cost: Multiply by 17, makes
55165 pence, which divided by 4, makes 13791 Groats, and there will remain one
penny. Secondly, divide that Quotient again by 6, makes 229 pound, 8 primes,
and the remayner is 3 Groats, or one shilling; and so the total is 229 pound,
17 shillings, 1 penny.

Example. ^

At 3 shillings, 7 pence a yard Holland, what will 752 else cost: multiply 752
by 43 pence, the price of one ell, makes 32336; which divided, as is before
taught, makes 134 pound, 14 shillings, 8 pence.

Example. ^

At 7 shillings, 11 pence the elle Cambricks, what will 85^ else cost. Reduce 7
shillings, 11 pence into pence, makes 95 pence; by which multiply 856, makes
8^320; which divided as before, makes 338 pound, 16 shillings, 8 pence.

Example. ^

At 2 shillings, 11 pence an elle Holland, what will 7856 else cost: multiply,
and divide as is before taught, makes 1145 li. 13 shillings, 4 pence.

Example. ^

At 17 shillings, 7 pence a yard Broad Cloth, what will 7856 yards cost:
multiply by 211* the price of one yard, and divide as before, makes 6906 pound,
7 primes.

Example. ^

If your given price have any farthings in it, then reduce your price into
farthings, and multiply your given number by those farthings, and the product
will be the number of farthings, which your sum will cost: then divide that
product by 16, makes the quotient Groats, and the remainer will be farthings,
always less then 16, or one Groate. Secondly, divide that quotient of Groats
by 6, makes pounds and primes, as before.

Examples.

At 5 shillings, 1 penny, one halfe-penny an ounce Plate, what will 356 ounces
cost. Reduce 5 shillings, 1 penny, halfpenny into farthings, makes 246
fa^things: by which multiply 356, makes 87567 farthings; which divided by 16,
makes 5473 Groats, and 8 farthings will remain; which divide again by 6,
makes 91 pound, 2 primes, and one Groat will remain, total is 91 pound, 4
shillings, 6 pence.

At 6 shillings, 9 pence, farthing an ounce of gilt plate, what will 3542
ounces cost: multiply your shillings by 48, the farthings which are in one
shilling, makes 288; to the which add 37 farthings, which are in 9 pence,
farthing, makes 325 farthings; and then work as before is taught, and you shall
find 1199 pound, 2 shillings; 3 pence, halfepenny.

Example. ^

Another way to work Practice.
Divide your number of yards, else, or pieces by 240, adding a Cipher to your
number given, and then multiply the Quotient by your price, and the Product is
the sum of pounds, and shillings, that the given number will cost.

At 17 pence the elle Canuas, what will 7848 else cost: add a Cipher, and
divide 78480 by 240, and the Quotient will be 32 pound, 7 primes; which
multiply by 17 pence, the price, makes 555 pound, 9 primes or 18 shillings.

Example. ^

At 3 shillings, 5 pence an ell of Holland, what will 702 else cost: divide
7020 by 240, makes 2 pound, 9 primes, and there will remain 6; which multiply
by 41 pence, the price of ^e ell, makes 118 pound, 9 primes, or 18 shillings,
and then the 6 else, makes 1 pound, 6 pence, the total is 119 pound, 18
shillings, 6 pence.

Example. ^

At 19 pence the elle of Holland, what will 32544 else cost: divide 325440 by
240, makes 1356; which multiply by 19 pence, the price of one elle, makes 2576
pound, 8 shillings.

The Golden Rule.
Of single proportion Direct, or the Rule of three, called The Goulden Rule.
IN this Rule of 3 Direct, there is always three terms given, and a fourth
required, and it is called the Goulden Rule, in regard of the excellency of
this Rule above all others. The difficulty of this rule consists in the right
placing of the three numbers given, set the term next your right hand,
whhereupon the question is moved, and a term of the same nature toward the
left hand, and the third term in the middle. Then multiply the second number
by the third, and divide the product by the first, and the Quotient is the
fourth proportional number sought or desired to be found out; whose
denomination is ever like unto the middle number.

1. Example.

If 90 yards of Cloth cost 23 pound, what cost 346 yards.

^

If 124 pound gain 37 pound, 12 shillings, what will 758 pound gain.

^

How to work this last example, and all other, after a more brief and exact
manner.
Divide the third number by the first, and by the Quotient multiply the second,
and the product is the answer.

Example.

If 356 else cost 137 pound, 12 shillings, 9 pence, what cost 2848 else.

^

First, dividing 2848 by 356, the Quotient is 8; by which I multiply 137 pound,
12 shillings, 9 pence, the products are 1096 pound, 96 shillings, 72 pence;
then divide 72 by 12, is 6 shillings; which added to 96 shillings, makes 102
shillings, or 5 pound, 2 shillings; the total is 1101 pound, 2 shiliings, as
before.

2. Example.

If 124 yards cost 17 pound, 10 shillings, 1 penny, what cost 744 yards.

^

If 32 pieces of Raysons cost 19 pound, 2 shillings, 2 pence, what will 112
pieces cost at that rate.

Example. ^

How to know whether any question given be to be answered by the Rule Direct,
or Conuersed.
By these notes following, you shall find, whether any question propounded be
to be answered by the Rule of 3 Direct, or conuersed; for always the third
number is the number whereon the question depends, and is distinguished from
the other two, by some one of these notes following.

^

And the answer is always, more or less, so that if it be more then the
lesser of your two extreme numbers is the divisor: if less, then the greater
of your two extremes is your divisor. If the number whereon the question be
depending, be your Divisor, the^ the answer is, by the converse Rule, and you
must multiply your two former numbers for Dividend. If the first number be the
Divisor, then the question is answerable by the Direct Rule, and the product of
the two latter numbers is your Dividend.

Example.

If 13 Cannons spend 358 pound of powder, what will 5 Cannons spend, now here
the question is, what 5 Cannons will spend. I answer, less then 13 Cannons;
wherefore by this rule, the greater of the two extremes, 13 is the divisor:
wherefore I multiply 358 by 5, and divide by 13, makes 137 pound, 613 that 5
Cannons will spend.

2. Example.

If 13 Cannons spend 358 powder, what will 5 Cannons spend.

^

2. Example.

I lent my friend 115 pound for 7 months, and when I came to him to require
the like kindness he could lend me by 54 pound, the question is, how long he
should forbear that 54 pound to make requital, or to equal my time, and
kindness.

If 115 pound require 7 months, what will 54 pound require: here the answer
in reason is, that 54 pound must be longer time forborne then 115 pound, and
so the answer is more times then 115 pound; so that I find the lesser of my
exteames 54, is my Divisor, and the question answerable by the Rule conuersed,
so that I multiply 115 by 7, makes 805; which divided by 54, makes 14 months,
4954 of a month, or 14 months, 25 days, 2325

Example. ^

4. Example.

A Captain of a Band of men is besieged in a City, having with him 7200 men,
and his victuals will serve the whole Company but 7 months, but there is no
hope left to have any fresh victuals until 16 months; the question is, how
many men he shall send away to make the victuals serve for 16 months. Answer,
less then 7200 men.

If 7 months require 7200 men, how many will 16 months ask.

^

Or thus; Considering the numbers, 200 may be had in 156 once, therefore for
200 take 24 days; then for 150 take 18 days, total 42 days; then there will
remain 6 to be multiplied by 24, makes 144200 parts of a day, as before.

If 112 pound cost 3 pound, 5 shillings, 5 pence, what will 3136 pound cost?

that rate? Here if you consider the proportion between the first number, and
the third, you shall find the third number does contain the first exactly
three times; wherefore you need not to multiply the second by the third, and
divide by the first number, but only take the second number, and multiply by 3,
makes 52 pound, 16 shillings for the price that 321 else will cost: behold the
work at large.

If 107 else of cloth cost 17 pound, 12 shillings, what will 321 else?

^

How to find whither that your numbers given be proportional, or not.
Divide your third number by the first, and if the quotient be an even number,
and nothing remain of your dividend, then the first and third numbers are even
proportional in whole numbers, as in the last example, the first number was
107, and the third number 321, so that in dividing the third number by the
first, the quotient is 3 and 0 remains: wherefore I conclude, that the first
and third numbers are proportionals in whole numbers, and that the third does
contain the first just three times, and so often must the fourth number sought
for, contain the second; and I conclude, that three times 17 pound 12
shillings, which is 52 pound 16 shillings, is the fourth proportional number
sought, as appears by the ordinary form of work in the last example.

^

If 36 else of cloth cost 13 pound, 4 shillings, 1 penny, what will 432 else
cost at that rate: divide 432 by 36, makes 12; by which multiply your second
number 13 pound, 4 shillings, 1 penny, makes 158 pound, 9 shillings.

^

A. does lend unto B. 600 pound for 8 months, the question is, how much B
shall lend unto A. for 12 months to recompense him, not reckoning compound,
interest. Answer. If 8 months require 600 pound, what will 12 months
require* the reason is less then 600 pound; wherefore divide 600 pound by 12,
makes 50; which multiply by 8, makes 400 pound.

Or otherwise by proportion, as 8 is to 12 so must 600 be to 400 pound, 23
parts of 600 pound.

If the number be not exactly proportional, yet there is a great abreuiation
to be made of the work of Reduction, Multiplication, and Division, in the
working of most examples in the Golden Rule; as for example.

If 19 Barrels of Figgs cost 16 pound 12 shillings, what shall 58 barrels cost,
here dividing 58 by 19, the Quotient is 3, and 1 will remain; wherefore I take
3 times 16 pound, 12 shillings for 57 barrels, and I have to work but for the
one remaining; which is but to divide 16 pound, 12 shillings, by 19, makes 17
shillings, 919 of one shilling, the total is 50 pound, 13 shillings, 919
shillings.

^

If 356 else of Holland cost 124 pound, 2 shillings, 3 pence, what will 7259
else cost at that rate. Reduce 124 pound, 2 shillings 3 pence, into pence,
makes 29787 pence; which multiply by 7259, makes 216223833 pence, which divide
by 356, make 607370* which divided by 240 pence, makes 253 pound, 170 pence, or
14 shillings 2 pence.

Example. ^

^

A second way more briefly to work this question, or any other of like nature,
is this: multiply the third number by the pounds and primes, or shillings and
pence, and divide the product by the first number, and the quotient will be the
fourth number sought. In the last example, 7259 else was the third number,
which multiply by 124l. 1 prime, or 2s. makes 900841 l. 9 primes: then also
7259 by 3 pence, makes 21777 pence; which divided by 240, makes 90 pound, 14
shillings, 9 pence: then add those two sums into one total, makes 9009326
primes, 9 pence; leave out*9, and then divide the residue by 356, makes 2530
pound, 7 primes, and 54356; which with the 9 d. brings out the two pence, as in
the last example.

Example. ^

^

If 24 pieces of Raysons cost 25 pound, 8 shillings, what will 324 pieces cost:
multiply 324 by 25 pound, 4 primes, makes 8229, 6 primes: which if you divide
by 24, the Quotient will be ^42 pound, 9 primes, or 18 shillings without
Reduction, as in the example following.

Example. ^

If 25 pound gain 1 pound, 8 shillings, what will 725 pound gain at that
rate? Multiply 725 by 1 pound 4 primes, makes 10150; which divided by 25, makes
40 pound, 6 primes, or 12 shillings.

^

And in this sort may diverse other questions be wrought in pounds and
shillings without Reduction, which I thought good to give a taste of, but I
will proceed here no further, because I purpose in the second part of this
Book to speak of them at large in the Treatise of Decimal Arithmatick,
whereby all manner of questions are to be wrought of Multiplication and
Division in pounds, shillings and pence, without Reduction, as shall appear in
their several places following. And now I will proceed to speak something of
the Rule of Three Direct and Conuerst in Fractionall operations, wherein I will
be as brief as I may, not intending to increase this little Treatise intended
for a pocket book, into over large a volume.

The Rule of 3 in Fraction.
If your three numbers given be all fractions, multiply the third by the
second, and divide the product by the first, and the quotient will be the
fourth proportional number sought for.

Example.

If 34 of a yard of Holland cost 45 of a pound, what shall 56 of one yard cost
at that rate? Multiply 56 by 45, makes 2030 or 23, which divide by 34, makes 89
of one pound, or 17 shillings, 79 of one shilling.

^

If 78 of one ell of cloth cost 912 of a pound, what will 17 else cost? Make
17 fraction wise, and multiply 171 by 912, makes 15312, which will be both
abreuiated by 3, makes 514, which divided by 78 makes 40828 parts of a pound,
or in smaltermes 1027; then divide 102 by 7, makes 14 pound, 47 of one pound
for the price.

^

2. Rule.

If all your three numbers given be fractions, multiply the Numerator of the
first fraction by the Denominator of the other two fractions, for to make your
Divisor. Then multiply the Denominator of your first fraction by the Numerators
of your other two fractions, to make your Dividend and then divide by your
Divisor, and the Quotient is the answer sought: but if your Divisor be
greater then your Dividend, then the Quotient is a fraction, less then a unite.

Example.

If 34 of a yard cost 45 of a pound, what cost 56 of a yard? Multiply 3, the
Numerator of the first fraction by 5 and 6, the denominators of the other two
fractions, makes 90 for your divisor; then multiply 4, the denominator of your
first fraction by 4 and 5, the numerators of your other two fractions, makes 80
for your dividend: now because your divisor is greater then your dividend,
place them fraction wise thus, 8090 of 1 li. or in least terms, 89 of a li.

Example. 90 If 34 of a yard cost 45 of a pound makes 89 l. what 56 of a yard
80

Again, if 78 of an ell cost 23 of a shilling, what will 34 else cost.

^

If 18 Pioners in 35 of a day do make 22 Rodds of Barricadoe, what will they
make in 7 days.

3 If 35 of a Day make 221 of a Wall, what 71 of a Day? 770

If 12 hundred 37 of Alum cost 15 pound 13 li. what will 324, 18 of a hundred
cost? Reduce the whole and broken numbers into broken, and work as is before
taught.

^

^

If 79 of an ell cost 811 of a pound, what will 1513 of an ell cost? 1 pound, 1
shilling, 6 pence, 34, fere.

Example. ^

If 34 of a yard of Velvet cost 78 of a pound, what will 28 yards cost. 32. l.
13 s. 4 d.

Example. ^

^

If 3 else 18 cost 57 of a pound, what will the whole piece cost, containing 28
else 12 at that rate? Answer.

^

If 12 pound, 4 ounces of Quichanella cost 4 pound, 3 shillings, 4 pence, how
much will 100 pound buy me at that rate? If 494 of a pound cost 256 of a pound
sterling, what will 6006 parts of a pound buy. Answer.

^

The proof of this last example. If 100 pound starling buy me 294 pound of
quichanella, how much shall 4 pound, 3 shillings, 4 pence buy me? to find the
value of the hundred, the rate of one pound being given; abate 2 places from
294, and it will be 2 pound 94100 parts of one pound: which multiply by 4
pound, 16, makes 12 pound 25100 parts, or one fourth for the proof.

^

If 30 men cast a Trench in 3 days 23; how many men would cast it in 56 of a
day? here by comparing these proportions together, I find that 56 the third
number, will desire a greater quantity of men to perform the work, then 113
of a day will require; wherefore this proportion is reciprocal or backward;
wherefore I multiply the two former numbers together, makes 3333, or in smaller
terms, 1101; which divided by 56, makes 6605; which divide by the denominator
5, makes 132 men.

^

In the Backward Rule, or Conuerst in fractions, multiply the Denominator of
your third number, by the numerators of both your other numbers for dividend,
then multiply the numerator of your third number, by the denominators of your
other two numbers for divisor, and then work as before.

Example. ^

If when the bushel of Wheat was sold for 4 shillings, the penny loaf
wayghed 6 ounces 12, what shall the same loaf weigh when Wheat is sold for 2
shilling, 8 pence p^nce the bushel? Multiply 48 by 13, makes your dividend
624: then 2 by 32, makes 64 for your divisor, and then divide 624 by 64, makes
9 ounces, 4864, or 34 of an ounce.

^

If when one ounce of sterling silver was worth 14 of a pound the penny of
silver weighed 30 grains, what shall the same penny weigh, when the ounce
shall be worth 13 of a pound.

Example. ^

If when a load of Hay was sold for 24 shillings, 8 pence, the penny bottle
weighed 3 pound, 14, what shall it weigh, now the load is sold 37 shillings.
Answer, 2 pound, 7176 of a pound.

^

If 3 yards 18 cost 9 shillings, 9 pence, what will 380 yards cost at that
rate? Reduce 3 yards 18 into eights, makes 258; then reduce 380 yards into
eights, makes 30408 parts: then 9 s. 9 d. into pence, makes 117 pence; by which
multiply 3040, makes 355680, which divided by 25, makes 14227 pence, 525 of one
penny in the whole 59 pound, 5 shillings, 7 pence, 525 or 15 of a penny. Behold
the work.

^

^

The proof of the former work. If 380 yards cost 59 pound, 5 shillings, 7
pence 525 of one penny, what will 3 yards 18 cost at that rate? reduce your
coin into 25, makes 355680; then reduce your 380 yards into 8, makes 3040; by
which divide 144227 pence, makes 9 shillings, 9 pence, as before.

^

If 34 ship Carpenters build a ship in 8 months 35, in how long time will 120
Carpenters build the same? Reduce 8 months 35 into fifthes, makes 435; then
multiply 34 by 43, makes 1462. Also put your divisor 120 into fifthes, makes
6005; then dividing of 1462 by 600, the Quotient will be 2 months 262600
parts of one month, or in smallest terms 131300 parts. And this Rule general
if one of your numbers be a fraction, put always your divisor into the same
fraction of your dividend, and the quotient will be of the same denomination
of your dividend, and so the answer was months, and parts of a month.

If 34 Carpenters ask 435 months, what 6005 month.

^

If 100 pound in 12 months gain 10 pound, what will 336 pound gain in 8
months? Take the tenth part of 336, which is ^^ li. 6 primes, or 12 s. makes
369 li. 12 s.

Secondly, if 12 months gain 33 pound 6 primes, what will 8 months gain? I
answer, less then 33 pound 6 primes; wherefore multiply by 8, and divide by
the greater extreme, 12, makes 22 pound, 4 primes, or 8 shillings, the answer.

If 120 Pioners in 6 days cast 300 rods of Trench, how many shall 600 men cast
up in 4 days. If 120 give 300, what will 600 give? Answer, 1500 Rods.

Secondly, if 6 days give 1500 rods, how many will 4 days give? I answer,
less; multiply by 4, and divide by 6, makes 1000 Rods.

If 112 pound in 12 months gain 100 li. what will 340 li. gain in 7 months?
Answer: 303 li. 47.

Secondly, if 12 months gain 303 li. 47 what will 7 months gain.

Example. ^

A general Rule*
Put always your divisor into the same fraction of your dividend, and your
quotient will be of the same denomination, that your dividend was: as in the
last example, 12 months was turned into seuenths, and also 303 pound 47 was
turned into seauenths of pounds, and so the quotient of that division was
pounds, and the fraction of a pound remaining.

If 7 pound in 13 months gain 3 pound, in how long time will 340 pound gain
60 pound. First, if 7 pound Gain 3 pound, what will 340 pound gain, makes 145
pound, 57 of a pound. Secondly, if 145 pound, 57 or 10207 ask 13 months, what
will 60 pound, or 4207 gain. Multiply by 13, and divide by 1020, makes 5
months 617 of a month.

If 600 great Horses in 5 days do spend 1125 Bushels of oats, how many
bushels will serve? 1400 Horses for 22 Days. First, say, if 600 give 1125, what
1400, makes 2625 bushels. Secondly, if 5 spend 2625 bushels, what will 22 days
spend? Multiply by 22, and divide by 3, makes 11550 bushels.

How to work the double Rule at one operation.
This last question, or any other of like nature which is wrought by the double
Rule at two several operations may be answered at one in this manner: multiply
the three latter numbers, to make your dividend one into the other; then
multiply the two former numbers for to make your divisor, and then divide the
dividend by the divisor, and the quotient will be the same, as in the last
example, 1125 being multiplied by 1400, makes 1575000; which again increased
by 22, makes your dividend 34650000. Then multiply your two former numbers 600
by 5, makes 3000 for the Divisor; and then dividing your dividend by your
divisor 3000, the quotient will be 11550 bushels, as before at two operations.

Example. ^

If 35 s. in 7 months gain 6 s. in how long time will 340 l. gain 100 l.
First, if 35 s. gain 6 s. what will 340 l. require? Reduce 340 l. into pence,
and multiply by 6, makes 40800; which divided by 35, makes 1165 s. 57 s.
Secondly, if 1165 ^. 57 require 7 months, what will 100 l, require? Makes 12
months, 8816 parts of a month.

Fellowship without Time.
This Rule differs very little from the Rule of three; for in this Rule the
sum of all the moneys disbursed, is the first number in the Golden Rule. Then
the gains or loss is the second number: the third number is each several
partners money disbursed so that the Rule must be severally wrought for each
several Partners portion.

Example.

Four Merchants made a company together; the first, viz. A. put in stock 74
pound, B. put in 90 pound, C. put in 100 pound, and D. put in 120 pound, and
they found that they had gained 84 pound; now the question is, what each man
must have of the gains, according to the proportion of his money disbursed.
First, add all the moneys disbursed into one total sum, viz. 74, 90, 100,
120, total is 384 for the first number in the Golden Rule. Then the second
number is 84 pound, the gains; and the third number is each particular man's
stock; then work as follows.

If 384 pound gain 84 pound, what will A. B. C. D. sums gain to them.

^

The like reason is in loss, as is in gains. Example: A certain ship being
in a tempest on the sea was forced to cast over board so much of her lading, as
amounted unto the sum of 642 pound, then there is great reason that all the
ventures should bear part of that loss, according to the proportion of his
stock which he ventured. As suppose: A. ventured 700 pound, B. 530 pound, C.
640 pound, D. 800 pound; total is 2670. Then say; If 2670 pound loose 642
pound, what will each of A. B. C. D. loose? as in the example following.

Example.

If 2670 pound loose 642 pound, what will A. B. C. D. sums loose to them.

^

fioure Merchants bought a ship, which cost them 3600 pound, whereof A* must
pay one third part of the money, B. one fourth, C. one fifth, D. one sixth; the
question is, what each man must pay of the saidsumme. Answer.

Seek a number wherein the like parts may be had, which is 60, and take the
like parts of that number for the numbers that you seek, for to find each man's
portion of the money* which he should pay. First, 13 of 60 is 20, the 14 is 15,
the 1*5 is 12, the 16 is 10; which add into one total, makes 57 for the first
number in the Golden Rule.

Example.

^

If 57 be 3600, what will be the sums of A. B. C. D.

^

The said ship made a Voyage to Sea, and has gotten all charges, deducted out
240 pound, the question is, what each man must have of the gains. Answer.

If 57 gain 240, what will A. B. C. D. sums gain to them.

^

Four Merchants made a Company; A. put in 320 pound, 13 shillings, 3 pence; B.
put in 840 pound, 16 shillings, 6 pence; C. put in 560 pound, 18 shillings, 9
pence; D. 1000 pound; and in one year they found they had gained 400 pound, 18
shillings, 6 pence: the question is, what each man must have of the gains.
First, the total sum of all their moneys makes 2721 pound, 8 shillings, 6
pence, or 653142 pence, for the first number. Then reduce each several man's
money disbursed into pence for the third number, the second is the gains also
reduced into pence, and then work according to the Rule.

Example.

If 2721 pound, 8 shillings, 6 pence gain 400 pound, 18 shillings, 6 pence,
what will A. B. C. D. sums gain to them.

^

Rules of Fellowship, with diversity of Time.
Multiply each man's money disbursed by the time that it continued in stock, and
gather the totals, as in the last Rule, to make the first term in the Golden
Rule, and the gains or loss is the second, and then each man's product of
money and time for the third term in the Golden Rule, and work as follows.

Example.

Three men made a stock, A. B. and C. and in long continuance of time by
dangerous adventures they gained, and got by prizes taken at Sea 2345 pound; A.
put in stock 40 pound, 14 months; B. put in 50 pound, 8 month; C. put in 85
pound 6 months, what shall each man have of this gains.

Example. ^

If 1470 pound gain 2345 pound, what will A. B. C. sums gain them.

^

The second question with more diversity of time, four Merchants made a
Company; A. put in 340 li. 19 s. 2 d. for 10 months; B. put in 930 li. for 9
months; C. put in 760 li for 12 months; D. put in 583 li. 13 s. 4 d. for 5
months, wherewith they gained 740 li. now the question is, to know what each
man must have of this gains.

^

Cut off two Ciphers from each number, and then work as follows.

If 57163 pence gain 1776 pence, what what will A. B. C. D. sums gain them.

^

Example.

There is a Booty or Spoil taken by 3 men worth 7851 pound, and they agree to
divide it in this sort; A* is to have one half, B. one third, C. one fourth,
what is each man's share.

To work this question, and all other of like nature, seek a number which may
be divided by all the denominators of your three fractions in whole numbers,
and the smaller such a number be that you choose, the more easy will your
work be; which for to find, multiply your denominators of your fractions one
into another; that is to say, 2 by 3 makes 6; and 6 by 4, makes 24; so 12, one
half of 24 will be euenly divided by all the three denominators, 2, 3 and 4.
Wherefore I take 12 of 12 is 6, and 13 of 12 is 4, and 14 of 12 is ^; which
added into one sum, makes 13 for first number in the Golden Rule; the second
is 7851 pound, and the third numbers are each several man's portion imagined to
be, viz 6, 4, 3, and then work as before.

If 13 give 7851 pound, what will A. B. C. sums give.

^

4. Example.

Four Merchants bought a house together, which cost 3000 pound; A. was to pay
12 and 6 pound overplus; B. 13 and 12 pound more; C. 8 pound less then 23; D
14 with 20 pound overplus. Now the question is, what each Merchant must pay of
this sum. Answer: First, the pounds overplus must be subtracted from the sum
given; and the pounds wanting must be added to the sum given; as for A. 6
pound, B. 12 pound, for D 20 pound, total is 38 pound, to be subtracted then;
for C. add 8 pound, therefore subtract 30 pound from 3000 pound, there will
remain 2970 pound; then work by the Rule of Fellowship, taking 12 for a
number, which will be divided by all the denominators, 2, 3 and 4, viz. take
for A. 6, for B 4, for C. 8, for D. 3; total is 21 for divisor, the second
number is 2970 pound, the third, each man's part imagined.

Example.

If 21 give 2970 pound, what will A. B. C. D. sums give.

^

The numbers found to A. are 848 pound 47, to which if you add 6 pound, makes
854 pound, 47.

To B 565 pound, to which 12 pound added, makes 577 pound, 57

To C. 1131 pound, 37, from which subtract 8, leaves 1123 pound, 37

To D. 424 pound, 27, to which add 20 pound, makes 444 pound, 27; the which
added into one total, makes 3000 pound, the proof.

And in this manner may infinite variety of questions be propounded, and
their doubts easily resolved; and here will I end concerning this Rule, and
go in hand with some pleasant questions to be wrought by position, which is
the most excellent Rule of all others in Arithmatick, as shall appear in the
second part of this Book in Decimall Arithmatick.

Position.
The Rule of Position requiring one number to be imagined, before the
principal proportion can be found.
TO work by this Rule; Take any number at pleasure, which you shall imagine to
be the true number sought, and proceed with it, as if it were the true number,
wherein if you have failed, by doubling or tripling according to the nature of
the question, you shall then attain unto the true number desired, by aid of
the Golden Rule, in manner following: for look what proportion is between the
false conclusion, and the false position, such proportion has the given
number, to the number sought.

Example.

A. B. and C. consent to buy a ship, which will cost them 2700 pound, so that
B. must pay twice so much as A, and C. must pay 4 times so much as B: the
question is, what each man must pay of this sum? I suppose A must pay 8
pound, then B must pay twice as much as A, which is 16 pound; then C must pay
64 pound, which is 4 times as much as B: but yet 8 pound, 16 pound, and 64
pound, is but 88 pound, and it should be 2700 pound, so that now I resort to
the Golden Rule, and work as follows. If 88 pound come of my Position 8
pound, of what comes 2700? Multiply 2700 by 8, and then divide by 88, makes 245
pound 4088, or 511 of a pound for the part that A must pay; then B must pay 490
pound, 1011 of a pound, which is twice as much as A; and C must pay 1960 pound,
4011 of a pound, which is 4 times as much as B. The total sum is 2700 pound.
Behold work as follows.

If 88 pound come of 8 pound, of what comes 2700.

^

2. Example.

A Captain of a Band of Men being asked, what number of Soldiers were in his
Band, answered, I do not readily know; yet (quoth he) of this I am certain,
that the 12 and 23, and 45, and 16 of their number added together into one sum,
are 384 men: now the question is, what sum of men he had in his Band. I
suppose he had 60 men, or 30 men in his Band, but the least number is best,
viz. 30, whereof 12 is 15, and 23 is 20, and 45 is 24, also 16 is 5, their
total is but 64 men, but that should be 384 men. Then say by the Golden Rule,
as follows.

If 64 come of 30, of what number comes 384.

^

Answer: he had 180 men in his Band, whereof

^

The solution of this Question another way more brief.
Divide 384 by 64, makes 6; which multiply by 30, makes 180 men, as before.

3. Example.

A certain man having spent 120 pound, had yet remaining 12 and 13 of his
whole substance; the question is, what his substance was. Answer: First, 12
and 13 is 56, which being taken from 66, the whole substance leaves remaining
16; therefore if 16 be 40 pound, what is 66? makes 240 pound.

^

4. Example.

A Merchant bought 384 yards of broad Cloth of three several prices, of each a
like quantity, and he was to pay half as much more for the second sort, as he
paid for the first, and twice as much for the third sort as he paid for the
second: now the question is, what each sort cost him, and at what price every
yard was rated unto him? I suppose the first sort cost him 4 pound, then the
second sort must cost him 6 pound, which is half as much more as the first;
and then the third sort cost him 12 pound, which is twice as much as the
second; the total is but 22 pound, but it should be 248 pound: wherefore if 22
pound come of 4 pound, of what number comes 248 pound?

Example. ^

The first cost him 45 pound, 111 of a pound; then the second sort cost 67
pound, 711 of a pound; the third sort cost 135 pound, 311 of a pound, total is
248 pound: then divide 384 by 3, and you shall find he had 128 yards of each
sort, and by Practice, you shall find the first sort cost 7 shillings, 12 d. a
yard; the second sort cost 10 shillings 7 pence a yard almost, the third sort
cost 21 shillings, 1 penny, 12 d.

Double Position.
The Rule of double Position.
SVppose a number at pleasure, as in the last Rule of single Position, and
proceed as if you had found the right number, and if by working you find the
true number, then your Position was the right number, which does seldom
happen. First, if by your working there comes out more then the true number;
then note it thus + with a cross; if less, then thus - with a long line,
which does signify less.

Secondly, suppose another number, greater or smaller, and work as before,
until you do find the true number sought; which if you do not find, see the
difference also from the true number sought, and note it with the sign + or -
as it shall be found.

Then thirdly, set your suppositions with their errors, more or less, as in
the examples following.

Fourthly, multiply cross the first position by the seconds error, and the
second position by the error of the first, and then if the signs be both
alike + or -, abate the lesser from the greater, and the remains shall be the
dividend. Also the lesser error abated from the greater, leaves the divisor*
but if the signs be contrary one +, the other less, add both together to make
the dividend, and add the two errors to make the divisor: and lastly divide
the dividend by the divisor, and the quotient is the true number desired.

1. Example.

A certain man seeing a purse in his friends hand, says unto him: It seems
unto me, that there is 100 Crowns in your purse* To whom the other answered:
Nay (quoth he) there are not 100 Crowns, but (says he) if they were
increased 12 and 13 * and 14, and lastly, one Crown overplus, then would they
be just 100 crowns.

I suppose there were 12 Crowns in his purse, to which if I add one half; of
12, which is 6; and one third of 12, which is 4; and one fourth of 12, which is
3; and lastly, one Crown more, the total will be but 26 Crowns, but they
should be 100 Crowns, so that this error is two little by 74 Crowns, which I
note thus:

74 - 12

Secondly, I suppose he had 24 Crowns, to which I add 12 of 24, which is 12
and 13, which is 8 and 14, which is 6: and lastly, one Crown overplus, the
total is 51, but it should be 100 Crowns, so that this is an error of 49,
too little, which I also note thus: 49 - 24

^

The answer is; that he had 47 pound 1325 parts of a pound in his purse. The
proof follows.

^

2. Example.

Twenty yards of Satin, and 12 shillings is equal unto 12 yards of velvet
less, 10 shillings; the price of either sort is required.

To answer this, or any other like question, take any number for the price of
a yard of the lesser number, which here is velvet, which at 20 shillings a
yard, less 10 shillings, amounts unto 230 shillings. Now admit a yard of
Satin at 14 shillings, so 20 yards and 12 shillings amounts unto 292
shillings; from which subtract 230 shillings, rests 62 s. more then the truth.
Again, rate a yard at 12 shillings, so the 20 yards and 12 shillings makes 252
shillings; from which take 230 shillings, rests 22 shillings more then the
truth also. Now multiplying 22 by 14, and 62 by 12, the productes are 308, and
744, and the difference of those numbers is 436; then take 22 from 62, rests 40
for divisor, by which divide the difference, makes 10 shillings, 910 shillings
for the price of a yard of Satin.

Example. ^

3. Example.

Otherways if 40, the difference of errors gain a, the difference of
positions, then 62 the first error yields 3 and 110*

Or if 40 yield 2, what 22? makes 1 and 110; this taken from 12, or 3, 110 from
14, leaves 10, 910 for the price, as before.

4. Example.

A Carpenter was hired to work 20 days at 12 pence a day, but every day that
he was idle, he was to abate 18 pence of his wages, and in the end he
received but 8 shillings: now the question is, how many days he wrought.

First, suppose he wrought 12 days, which comes to 12 shillings, then must
the 8 days that he played, come to 12 shillings at 18 pence a day also: but
this question says, there came due to him 8 shillings? Behold an error of 8
shillings too little.

Again, I say that he wrought 14 days, amounting to 14 shillings* then 6
days that he played at 18 pence a day, comes to 9 shillings; this taken from
14 shillings, leaves 5 shillings, and it should be 8 shillings, which is an
error of 3 shillings too little. Now multiplying 12 by 3, and 14 by 8, the
products are 36. and 112, and the excess is 76; which being divided by 5, the
difference of the errors, quoteth out 15, 15 for the number of working days,
and 4 days 45 for the number of playing days.

12 - 8 5 14 - 3

Otherwise.

If 5* the difference of errors, yield 2, the difference of positions, what 8
the first error? makes 3, 15 to be added to 12.

Or if 5 be 2, what is 3* makes 1, 15 to be added to the second position 14,
whereby all three ways the numbers of the Days he wrought are found out.

Barter or Exchange.
TWo men barter, one has Ginger of 10 pence a pound ready money, and in barter
he will sell it for 12 pence a pound. The other has sugar of 12 pence a pound
ready money, but in barter he will sell it for 14 pence a pound; the Question
is, how much Sugar will pay for 756 pound of Ginger? First, put your price of
your Ginger into pence, makes 9072 pence; which divide by 14 pence, makes 648
pound of Sugar, which must be given for 756 pound of Ginger, at 12 pence the
pound.

2. Example.

Two Merchants will barter, one has Raysons of 34 shillings the hundred ready
money, and in barter he will sell them for 40 shillings: the other has Nut
megs of 4 shillings the pound ready money, how shall he set his Nut megs to
make the like profit. Put your coin into pence, and say; If 408 d. be 480 d.
what is 48 d. Multiply 480 by 48, and divide by 408, makes 56 d. 2^^5^ of one
penny for the price of the Nutmegs; vid. 4 s. 8 d. 12 of a pound.

3. Example.

Two Merchants will barter, one has Holland of 2 shillings, 7 pence the ell
ready money, which he will sell in barter for a shillings, 10 pence the ell,
and yet he will gain privately 10 pound in 100 pound over that gain* at what
price must he then set his Holland? Answer: Set down 2 shillings 10 pence in
pence, makes 34 pence; of which take the tenth part, which is 3 pence, 410, or
25, and add to 34 pence, makes 37 pence 25 of a penny for the price, to sell
one ell to make that gains. Now the other Merchant has wool at 7 shillings a
Todde ready money, how shall he set his wool to make like profit that he be
not deceived in the bargain. If 31 pence be 37 pence, 25, what is 84 pence?
Multiply 374 primes by 84, makes 31416; which divide by 31, makes 101 pence,
310 penny, or 8 shillings, 5 pence, 310 of one penny, which is the price for
him to sell his wool to make like profit.

Example. ^

4. Example.

Two Merchants will barter, one has Sugar of 6 pound, 4 shillings ready money,
and he will sell it for 7 pound the hundred. The other has Ginger of 4 pound,
6 shillings the hundred, and in barter he will sell it for 5 pound the hundred;
now the question is, at what rate each of them does gain per cent' and which
has the advantage of the other. First, if 6 pound, 2 primes gain 8 primes,
what will 100 pound gain? Multiply 8 primes by 100, makes 800 primes; then ad
2. or 3 ciphers more to it, which divide by 62 primes, makes 12 l. 9 primes,
1031 of a prime, or near 12 l. 18 shilling, 8 pence, which the first man does
gain per cent^.

Secondly, if 4 pound, 3 primes gain 7 primes, what will 100 pound gain?
Multiply 7 primes by 100, and add 2 ciphers more, makes 70000; which divide by
43 primes, makes 16 pound, 2 primes, 3443 of a prime; from which subtract 12
pound, 18 shillings, 8 pence, rests 3 pound, 6 shillings, 2 pence, which the
second man has gained more then the first gained.

6. Example.

Two Merchants barter, one has a certain number of pieces of Sakkins at 18
shillings a piece, for the which the other does give him 1806 else of linen
Cloth, at 16 pence the ell, and yet 30 pound in ready money; the Question is,
how many pieces of Sakkin he had. First, find what 1806 else of linen Cloth
cost by Practice? makes 120 pound, 8 shillings: to the which add 30 pound,
makes 150 pound, 8 shillings: then divide 150 pound, 4 primes, by 18 shillings,
or 9 primes, makes 167 pieces of Sakkin, and 19 of a piece.

Example. ^

6. Example.

Two men will barter, one has Pepper of 22 pence the pound ready money, but in
barter he will sell it for 27 pence the pound: the other has Sinamond of 3
shilling, 6 pence the pound ready money, and in barter he will sell it for 4
shilling the pound; the question is, how much sinamond will pay for 384 pound of
Pepper at that rate? First, 384 pound of Pepper at 27 pence the pound is 43
pound, 4 shillings; which divide 432 primes, makes 216 pound Sinamond, which he
must give.

7. Example.

If 4 English else make 5 yards, and 13 yards, makes 50 Pawnes at Geanes, how
many Pawnes is in 100 else English. If 5 be 4, what is 13, makes 10 25.
Secondly, if 10 25 be 50, what is 100, 480 1013

8. Examples.

Every 4 else at Antwerpe makes 5 at Frankford, and 25 there makes 24 Braces
at Luques, the question is, how many braces is 100 in Antwerpe. If 25 be 24,
what is 5, makes 4 45. Secondly, if 4 be 4 45, what are 100, makes 120.

9. Example.

If 3 yards at London be 4 else at Antwerpe, how many yards at London make 84
else at Antwerpe. If 4 be 3, what 84? makes 63 else.

10. Example.

At Roan 112 else make but 98, and 100 else at Roan is 112 at Siuil, how many
of ours in 100 else of Si^ull. If 98 Roan be 112 else, what 100 Roan, makes 114
else, 17 of an ell. Secondly, if 112 else be 114, 17, what is 100 Civil, makes
102, 1925.

11. Example.

If 67 yards at London be 100 in Venice; how many are 7894? multiply by 67,
makes 5288 yards, 98100 parts.

12. Example.

A Merchant does deliver 400 pound sterling in London by exchange for Antwerpe,
at 23 shillings, 5 pence the pound sterling, the question is, how much Flemish
money, he shall receive at Antwerpe: put your 23 s. 5 d. into pence, makes 281
pence; which multiply by 400, makes 112400 pence; which divide by 240, makes
468 pound, 6 shillings, 8 pence, which he must receive at Antwerpe.

Example. ^

13. Example.

If 100 pound starling be 134 pound, 6 shillings, 4 pence Flemmish, what is one
pound starling worth? Reduce your coin 134 l. 6 s. 4 pence, into pence makes
32236; which divided by 100, makes 322 pence, 925 pence, or 26 shillings, 10
pence, 925 of one penny, for one pound sterling.

If one pound sterling be 1 pound, 14 shilling, 7 pence, ob. Flemish, how much
sterling money is in 100 li. Flemmish? Reduce 100 pound into pence, makes 24000
pence; then put it into half pence, makes 48000 half pence; then put 1 pound,
14 shillings, 7 pence, ob. into half pence, makes 831; by which divide 48000,
makes 57 pound, 15 shillings, 1 penny almost, and so much sterling money is in
100 pound of Flemish money at that rate.

Of Gain and Loss.
IF 13 pieces of Canuas cost 17 pound, 12 shillings, how may I sell them to
gain 8 pound in the hundred? Multiply 176600 by 8, makes 19 pound, 19008, or
two pence almost, and so much must he sell them for to gain 8 pound in the
hundred.

If 17 pound, 12 shillings gain 1 pound, 8 shillings, 2 pence, what will 100
pound gain? Multiply 1 pound, 8 shillings, 2 pence in Decimalls by 100, and
divide by 17 pound, 6 primes, makes 8 pound in the 100, the proof.

Example. ^

A Merchant has lent 630 pound at interest for 10 pound in the 100 for 3
years interest upon interest, the Question is, unto what sum it will amount
unto at the end of the term? Answer: Take the tenth part, and add it into
one total 3 several times, makes 838 pound, 10 shillings, 7 pence, 15 of a
penny for principal and interest, at the rate given, to be paid at the end of
three years.

Example. ^

2. Example.

A Merchant receives for principal and interest 838 pound, 10 shillings, 7
pence, 15 of a penny at 10 pound in the hundred compound interest, which was
for money delivered out for 3 years; now the Question is, what was the sum
of money that was lent? To do this, or any other the like question, divide the
sum of money received by 110 three several times, and the three quotients
will show the yearly increase of the money lent, and the last quotient will be
the answer to the question, or the money disbursed, as in the example
following, which is the proof of the former question.

Example. ^

3. Example.

A Merchant lent 100 pound for 7 years at 10 pound in the hundred Compound
Interest, the Question is, what he shall receive at the end of the term.

Example. ^

Makes at 7 years end 194 li. 17 s. 5 d.

How to work Compound interest at any rate per cent.
What is the principal and interest of 352 pound, put out at 8 pound in the
hundred compound Interest, to be paid at the end of two years? Add two
ciphers to 352 pound, makes 35200; then place your Interest 8 under the lowest
cipher next the right hand, and multiply 352 by 8, placing the product under
the line, and that will be the Interest; which added into the sum lent, makes
the total of the principal and interest* and so work for the second, third,
and fourth year, as in the Example.

^

First I multiply 35200 by 8, makes 2816, which I add unto 35200, makes 38016;
then I multiply 3801600 by 8, makes 4105728, or 11 shillings, 5 pence, abating
4 figures for the 4 ciphers, which I added to the sum for to find out the
prime line, as appears in the example; and so of any other sum or rate in
the hundred.

At 17 pound the hundred per annum compound interest, what will 879 pound amount
unto to be all forborne unto the end of 5 years? Add 2 ciphers to your sum
given, and multiply by your Interest 17, and add into the principal, and so
work 5 years, and the last product will be the sum of money to be
received, viz. 1927 pound, 3 shillings, 5 pence.

Example. ^

If a Merchant buy a parcel of Holland, at 3 pound, 6 shillings the piece; and
another parcel at 4 pound, 2 shillings the piece; the third sort at 4 pound 10
shillings the piece, the fourth sort at 5 pound the piece; how may he sell 40
pieces, of each sort 10 pieces to gain 18 pound in the hundred, and give 9
months time for the payment; as in the Example following.

Example. 10 Pieces at 3. 6. a piece, 33. 0. 10 Pieces at 4. 2. a piece, 41. 0.
10 Pieces at 4. 10. a piece, 45. 0. 10 Pieces at 5. 0. a piece. 50. 0. The
sum is 169. 0.

^

Take the 34 of the interest, makes 191 pound, 16 shillings, 3 pence, 35 of one
penny, to sell to gain 18 pound in the hundred, for to give 9 months time.

A Merchant sold 300 quarters of wheat, cost him 352 pound ready money, and
lost 7 pound in the hundred, what did one quarter cost him, and at what rate
did he sell a quarter, to loose 7 pound in the hundred? Take the interest at 7
pound in the hundred, which is 24 pound, 12 shillings, 9 pence, 35, which
subtract from 352 li. makes 327 pound, 7 shillings, 2 pence, 25 of a penny, and
divide the remainer by 300, makes 1 pound, 1 shilling, 10 pence for the price
sold: secondly, divide 352 pound by 300, makes 1 pound, 3 shillings* 5 pence
ob. for the price which it cost him

Rye sold for 3 shillings a bushel loses 20 pound in the hundred, what will
then be lost, if it be sold for 3 shillings 6 pence a bushel? If 3 shillings
be 80 pound, what is 3 shillings 6 pence? Multiply 80 pound by 3 12, or by 3
shillings, 6 pence, makes 2800; which divide by 3, makes 93 li. 13 Or
otherwise, if 36 pence be 80 pound, what is 42 pence? Multiply 80 by 42, and
divide by 36, makes 93 pound 13 of a pound as before.

If in one ell of Cloth sold for 3 shillings, 2 pence there were gained after
the rate of 10 pound in the hundred, what did that ell of cloth cost? divide
385, or 38 penny 12 by 110, makes 35 pence that the ell cost.

^

If one yard of Holland cloth cost 2 shillings, 11 pence, how many yards shall
I buy for 34 pound, 6 shillings, put it into pence, makes 8232 pence; which
divide by 35 pence, makes 235 yards, 15 yard.

How to gain any rate in the Hundred you desire.
Put your price that one yard, ell, pound or piece does cost you into pence;
and then for 10 pound in the hundred, take the tenth part of that sum, which
is the same number, placed one place nearer to the right hand, and that is the
profit or Interest; which added up into the price given, makes the price to sell
one yard, pound, ell, or piece, to gain 10 pound in the hundred ready money.

Example.

If one ell of Holland cloth cost 3 shillings, 9 pence, how may I sell to gain
10 pound per cent' ready money? Put 3 shillings 9 pence into pence, makes 45
pence: then take the tenth part of 45 pence, which is 4 pence 510, or one half,
makes 49 d. 12 for the price to sell an ell to gain 10 li. per cent.

Example. ^

If your price you would gain, be not 10 pound in hundred, then add 2
Ciphers to your number of pence given and multiply that number by your
Interest, omitting to multiply by the ciphers, and the product under the line
is your Interest or gain, which added up into one sum; makes the price to
sell one yard, ell, pound, or piece, to gain according to the rate desired
example.

If one pound of Cloves cost 4 shillings, 10 pence, how may I sell to gain 9
pound per cent ready money? Put 4 s. 10 d. into pence, makes 58 d. then ad 2
ciphers, makes 5800; which multiply by 9, makes 522 or 5 pence, 22100 parts of
one penny; which added up to the upper numbers, is 63 pence, 22100 parts of one
penny, or 5 shillings, 3 pence, 15 of a penny for the price to sell one, to
gain 9 pound in the hundred.

^

If one piece of Raysons cost 18 shillings, 9 pence, how may I sell to gain 18
pound in the hundred ready money? put your money into pence, makes 225 pence,
to which add 2 ciphers, makes 22500; which multiply by 18, makes 4050, or 40
pence, ob. which added into the price, makes 265 pence, ob. for the price to
sell one piece to gain 18 pound in the hundred.

Example. ^

^

A Merchant lent wares for 10 pound in the hundred profit for 12 months, and
at the end of 6 months he received principal and interest 356 ls. the
question is, what was the sum lent? Answer: add 2 ciphers to 356 pound, and
divide by 105 pound, which is 6 months interest and principal, makes 339
pound 121 parts of a pound for the sum lent.

Example. ^

Equation of Payment.
The Rule of payment is to bring diverse paymen^s due at several days to be
paid at one entire payment.
AMerchant is to pay at diverse payments 600 pound: viz. 200 pound present, 200
pound at 8 months, 140 pound at 6 months, and 60 pound at 2 months: now he
is willing to pay all at one payment, what time must be given? The ready money
being omitted, set the rest as numerators thus, 200600 140600 60600 parts,
which in their least terms* abreuiated, makes 13* 730 and 110. Now multiply 13
by 8, makes 2, and 23; secondly, 730 by 6, makes 1 and 25; thirdly, 110 by 2
makes 15; total is 4 months, and 415 of a month for the time sought.

Examples. ^

A Merchant has owing him 752 pound, to be paid 200 pound content; 200 pound
at 3 months, 130 pound at 5 months, and the rest at 12 months; now at what
time ought this money to be paid all at one payment?

Example. ^

A Merchant has owing unto him 782 pound, 12 shillings, to be paid 13 at 4
months 12 at 7 months, the rest at 12 months, what time must it be all at
one payment.

^

Makes 6 months, 56 of a month.

VVines worth 14 pound ready money are sold for 16 pound, to pay 13 at 3
months, 12 at 4 months, and the rest which is 16 at 12 months, the question
is, what is gained in 100 pound in 12 months.

^

Makes at 5 pound in the hundred.

Sugars worth 21 pound ready money are sold for 25 pound, to pay 15 ready
money, 18 at 4 months, 310 at 7 months, 38 at 15 months; the question is, at
what rate per cent* per annum they were sold.

^

Makes 8 pound, 940 per cent*.

Alligation Mediall.
ALlegation is an Arte^ teaching to combine or knit together diverse things
unequally prised, and thereby to find an equal price of any part of the said
mixture, Alligation Mediall, is that which by the augmenting the quantity of
every several portion to be mixed by his own price, and dividing the sum of
all the products by the total of the several portions to be mixed, finds
the thing sought.

Example.

Three several sorts of Barley are to be mixed; viz. 34 bushels at 18 pence, and
76 at 20 pence, and 100 at 22 pence; the Question is, what one bushel of that
mixture will be worth? First, multiply each number by his price, viz. 34 by 18,
76 by 20, and 100 by 22, makes 612, 1520, and 1200, the total is 4332: then
add the number of bushells into one sum, makes 210; by which divide 4332 d.
makes 20 pence, 132210 of one penny for the price of one bushel so mixed.

2. Example.

If you will mix 30 gallons of Sack at 4 shillings a gallon, with 150 gallons
of White Wine at 2 shillings the gallon, what will a gallon of that mixture be
worth? Multiply 30 by 4, makes 120 shillings; also 150 by 2 shillings, makes
300 shillings, total is 420 shillings: then add 30 and 150, makes 180
gallons; by which divide 420 shillings, makes 2 shillings, 13 of a shilling, or
2 shillings, 4 pence, for the price of one gallon so mixed.

3. Example.

Admit there were 6 portion of Silver of 7 ounces fine, 12 of 8 ounces fine,
and 25 of 10 ounces fine, which are to be mingled with 10 pound of Copper,
what is a pound of that mixture worth? For answer: multiply 6 by 7, makes 42;
also 12 by 8 makes 96, and 25 by 10, makes 250, the total is 388, which being
divided by 53, the total of 6, 12, 25 and 10 makes 7 ounces, 1753 of an ounce;
and so much fine is a pound of that mixture.

4. Example.

A Merchant has 6 several sorts of Spices, of which he will sell, of each an
equal quantity of several prices for the sum of 323 pound, 8 shillings:
viz. Sinamond large at 4 shillings, 6 pence a pound; Nutmegs Case at 3
shillings, 8 pence a pound; Large Maces at 8 shillings a pound; and Pepper Case
at 2 shillings 2 pence a pound, Pepper Callico at 22 pence the pound, and
Ginger large at 10 pence a pound; the Question is, how many pound he must have
of each to make the just sum of 323 pound, 8 shillings? Answer: first, put
your money into shillings, makes 6468 shillings; secondly, put all your prices
of the Spice into one sum, and by that sum, which is 21 shillings divide
6468, makes 308 pound which he must sell of each.

Example. ^

Alligation Alternat.
ALligation Alternat is that, which alters the places of such excess as
commonly fall between the mean price, and the extremes; in which
counter-change, if the extremes be equal, then the difference between the
mean price, and lesser extreme is to be set against the greater extreme, and
of the contrary if otherwise.

1. Example.

White Wine of 20 pence the gallon is to be mixed with Sack of 3 shillings a
gallon, so that there must be mixed 300 gallons to make the price to be but 2
shillings, 4 pence the gallon, the question is, how much of each sort must be
taken. The numbers set down, as in this example thus, the difference of 20 the
lesser extreme from 28, is 8; also the difference of 36 the greater extreme is
also 8, so that I find you must take as many of one sort, as of the other to
make this mixture: viz. 150 gallons of each sort.

2. Example.

White Wine of 16 pence a gallon is to be mixed with Sack of 40 pence the
gallon, how many gallons must be taken of either sort, so that 120 gallons may
be of 30 pence the gallon.

The numbers being set down, as in this example, the difference of 16 the
lesser extreme from 30 the mean price, there will remain 14, which I plate
against 40; then take the difference of 40, the greater extreme, from 30 the
mean price, there will rest 10 to be linked with the lesser extreme; whereby I
find, that so often as I take 14 gallons of Sack I must take 10 gallons of
White Wine to make the mixture:

^

3. Example.

A certain Clothier is desirous to mingle 144 pound of wool of 4 sorts: viz.
blew wool of 10 shillings the stone, red wool of 11 shillings the stone,
green wool of 12 shillings, white wool of 9 shillings the stone, how many
stones of each shall he take, that one stone of the mixture may be worth 14
shillings.

The counter-change being made, according to the Rule, as is in the Margent it
is plain, that so often as you take 5 of Blew, you must take 3 of Green, and
2 of Red, and 2 of White. Therefore if 12 be 144, what

THE SECOND BOOK.

Containing a Treatise of Decimall Arithmatick:

Wherein is taught how to work all manner of operations in Decimall
Arithmatick, more speedy and easy, then by vulgar Arithmatick; and first of
the Decimall Table.

LONDON, Printed by Augustine Matthewes dwelling in the Parsonage-house in
Saint Brides lane, near Fleetstreet, 1623.

THE USE OF THE Decimall Table.
THe Decimall Table following does begin from one Farthing unto a Prime, or two
Shillings; so that if you have a Decimall Fraction given, which does contain
90625 sixths: search it in the Decimall Table, and you shall find it over
against 21 pence, three farthings and that is the value of that fraction given.

Or if you would know how to set out 16 pence halfe-penny in Decimalls; search
in the Table against 16 d. 2 g. and you shall find 6875 fifthes for the
decimall sought.

But if you would set out any number of shillings from one shilling unto one
pound, or ^o shillings; search in this little Table following, and you shall
find your desire. As if you would set out 15 shillings in Decimalls, you shall
find 7 primes, 5 seconds for 15 shillings, and so of any other sum, as in the
example following.

THE SECOND BOOK, CONTAINING A TREATISE of Decimall Arithmatick.
The declaration of the parts of the Decimall Table.
FIrst, the Decimall Table in the left Margent contains certain numbers in
great and small letters; first, from 1 farthing unto one prime, or tenth of a
pound, or two shillings. Then from one prime for every shilling unto one pound
starling, or 20 shillings.

First, beginning in the left margent is set down one farthing in the
uttermost parallel to the left hand, in the first parallel of the Table, and so
continuing from one farthing to one prime, or 2 shillings; and over against
every number in the left side in a right line toward the right hand is
contained the numbers in decimals, answering unto every farthing from one
farthing to one prime, or 2 shillings; and in the upper margent in the head of
the Table is contained, the true denominations of the said are all numbers in
primes, seconds, thirds, fourths, fifths, sixths, and seuenths, which are small
enough to work any question exact to a small fraction of one penny in a sum
of great value, as shall appear by examples following. But here you shall
note, that all the numbers in the said Table cannot be exact and perfect.

To find the value of a Decimall fraction in the parts of Coin.
Suppose the number given to be 2 seconds, 4 thirds, 5 fourths, and 7 fifthes,
and you desire to know the true value thereof in coin; set down your numbers,
as in the example following, and mark your prime line, and then multiply the
fraction by 240, the pence in one pound, and the numbers that arise by
multiplication over the prime line are the sum of pence, the value of that
fraction given, and the remainer on the right hand of the prime line is the
fraction of one penny.

Example. ^

Here by multiplication of 2457 fifthes by 240 pence, I find 5 pence is gone
over the prime line, and there remains 82080: 100000 parts of one penny. Now
to know the value of that fraction in farthings, multiply the same by 4, and so
many as go over the prime line, are farthings, the rest is the fraction of a
farthing.

Example. ^

Numeration in Decimals.
If you have a number to be expressed in Decimals of money, or Coin sterling,
learn first by the Decimall Table how to express your Coin, from one penny
unto one pound sterling, or from one farthing to one pound sterling, for which
the Table going before was calculated. If you would know the manner how to
calculate the said Table; divide 1 pound, adding 7 ciphers unto it, by your
part you would know how to set forth in Decimals: as if you would know how a
farthing will stand in Decimals; divide 1 pound with ciphers by 960, the number
of farthings in one pound sterling, and the quotient will be the numbers in
Decimals, signifying one farthing.

Example: ^

So that I find, that dividing of 1 pound by 960 farthings, the Quotient is 1
third, 0 fourth, 4 fifths, 1 sixth, and 6 seuenths: for if you should have
proceeded, adding more Ciphers, the Quotient would have been always 6, because
I see the number remaining to be the same it was at the last, that is 64. And
although a farthing cannot be set out exact in Decimals, yet it will serve in
Multiplication and Division: for in 10000 yards or else, it will not differ 1
penny, as shall appear afterward by examples in their places.

How to set out a penny in Decimalls.
Divide 1 penny with Ciphers by 240, the number of pence in one pound sterling,
and the quotie^t will be a penny in decimals.

2. Example. ^

Here seeing that after I find the first quotient 6, and the remainer 16, as
before I cease Division, as needless any further, knowing it will produce 6 in
the quotient infinitely, and therefore I put as many times 6 in the quotient, as
I find expedient and needful, and 1 penny stands thus:

^

And these and diverse other numbers will not be set exact in Decimals, but yet
they will serve to great purpose and exactnes in a multitude of questions, in
saving an infinite labor in Reduction, and Multiplication and Division.

How to break a pound into his exact parts.
Set down 1 pound thus, 10; then take the tenth, which is one prime, or 2
shillings, which I note thus,

^

Then take half of that prime or 2 shillings, saying, the one half of 10 is
5, or the one half of one prime is 5 seconds, or one shilling; then the one
half of 5 seconds is 2 seconds, and 5 thirds, saying, the one half of 5
seconds, is 2 seconds, and 5 thirds, which is 6 pence: then half of 2 seconds,
5 seconds, is 1 second, 2 thirds, 5 fourths, which does represent 3 pence in
Decimals. Again, one half of 1 second, 2 thirds, 5 fourths, is 6 thirds, 2
fourths, 5 fifths, representing 1 penny, halfpenny, or three half pence.
Again, half of that number is 3125, or 3 thirds, 1 fourth, 2 fifths, 5
sixths; signifying three farthings in Decimalls; behold the work.

Example. ^

^

It is also very necessary to understand the proportional parts of a pound,
for by them are many questions speedily wrought in Decimals, as shall appear
in the examples of Multiplication and Division afterward.

How to express the value of any number in Decimals.
Admit for example this number following, is to be expressed according to the
computation of Decimall Arithmatick, viz. 3785725 thirds: then for the
expressing the signification of that number in the known parts of Coin,
first, mark out your prime line, to distinguish the whole numbers from the
fractions with a right down stroke with the pen, and then you shall find the
numbers to stand thus 3785 pound, 7 primes, 2 seconds, and 5 thirds; which
search in your Decimall Table, and it does signify 14 shillings, 6 pence; so
that the whole number is 3785 pound, 14 shillings, 6 pence, and so of all
numbers; for you shall understand, that every prime does signify in value 2
shillings, every second 2 pence and 25 parts of 1 penny, and every 5 thirds 1
penny, and 15 of 1 penny: or else every prime is 110 of one pound; every second
1100 part of one pound, and every third 11000 part of one pound, etc.
infinitely.

How to remove a Decimall number from one place to another.
If you have a Decimall number given: as for example, ^3 pence, which does thus
stand in Decimalls, 1 second, 2 thirds, 5 fourths; then you desire to know how
it will stand in the place of primes, pounds, or in the place of 10 l. or
hundreds or thousands. remove it one place toward the left hand, and it is 1
prime, 2 seconds, 5 thirds, or in known parts of coin 2 shillings, 6 pence.
Again, remove them one place more toward the left hand, and it will be 1
pound, 2 primes, 5 seconds, or 1 pound, 5 shillings. Again, remove one place
more: and it is 12 pound, 19 shillings: Again, remove it one place more, and
all your fractions are in whole numbers, and will signify 125 pound, etc.

^

And this Rule is very necessary to be well and perfectly understood, for by
it any price be given of a unite in decimals. you may speedily know what 100,
or 1000, or 10000 will cost at that rate, only by adding of one, two, or more
Ciphers.

As for example, if one ell cost 6 shillings 3 pence, what will 100 else cost
at that rate? first, s^t out your price in decimals thus, 3 primes, 1 second, 2
thirds, 5 fourths, and adding of two Ciphers, because 100 has 2 Ciphers, the
sum will be 312500: and because your fractions were fourths, cut off 4 figures
and Ciphers toward the right hand, or mark your prime line, and you shall
find, that 100 else will cost 31 pound, 5 shillings at that rate.

1. Example. ^

If the numbers of the price given will not be exactly set down in Decimals:
as for example, at 7 pence, 3 farthings a yard, what will 100 yards cost? Set
down your price as near as may be, by your Decimall Table, which is 322916
seuenths, add unto it two ciphers, makes 32291600; and because your fractions
are seuenths, cut off 7 figures, and there will be 3 pound, 4 shillings, 7
pence.

2. Example. ^

And thus much shall suffice for Numeration in Decimalls, and I will now
proceed unto the second Rule of Arithmatick, viz. Addition in Decimals.

CHAP. II. Addition in Decimals of Coin.
I If you have diverse several numbers given in Decimalls to be added together
into one sum, place them in order every one right under his like
denomination, or kind, Integers under Integers, Primes under Primes, Seconds
under seconds, etc. Then begin your Addition at the right hand at the least
Denomination first, and add them all according to the Rule of Addition, as if
they were all whole numbers, always having a care to mark out your prime
line, and the total of your Addition will show you the just value of those
whole numbers and fractions.

1. Example. ^

^

CHAP. III. Subtraction in Decimalls.
IF you have two numbers in Decimals, the one to be subtracted from the other,
place them above one the other, as in Addition, the greater numbers in the
upper part, and the smaller numbers right underneath, and then subtract them as
if they were whole numbers, and note down the remayners each in their proper
places, as in this example.

1. Example. ^

^

2. Example. ^

^

CHAP. IV. Multiplication in Decimalls.
IF you have any two numbers given to be multiplied in decimals, place your
multiplicand uppermost, and your multiplier right underneath, as if the same
were absolute whole numbers, and no fractions at all; and when your numbers are
placed, mark how many fractions your two numbers does contain, and note that
number down, and multiply according to any of my former instructions in the
first book; and when the product is gathered, cut off your prime line, just so
many figures and ciphers, as your multiplicand and multiplier had fractions
between them, and the work is ended.

Example.

If you will multiply 758325 thirds, by 3857 primes, I place first my numbers,
and then I find my multiplicand to have 3 fractions, to wit, primes, seconds
and thirds, and I find my multiplier to have one fraction, only primes, which
makes 4 fractions, and so many figures I cut off from the product.

Example. ^

2. Example.

If you will multiply 34 pound, 5 shillings 3 pence, by 16 pound, 6 shillings,
6 pence, set them in Decimals, 342625 fourths, by 16325 thirds, and multiply
them together, and cut from the product 7 figures to the right hand, and the
product will be 559 pound, 6 shillings, 8 pence ob. almost.

Example. ^

3. Example.

If you will multiply 758 Integers by 3 primes, 7 seconds, 5 thirds, which is
by 7 shillings, 6 pence; place them as in the last example, and from the
product cut off the 3 figures for the 3 fractions, and the total is 284 pound,
5 shillings, the sum that 758 else will cost at 7 shillings, 6 pence an ell,
etc.

Example. ^

If you will multiply fractions by fractions in decimals; as to multiply 5
primes, 2 seconds, 6 thirds, 3 fourths, by 7 primes, 2 seconds, 5 thirds; set
them as before, and cut off 7 figures.

4. Examples.

^

Makes 7 s. 7 d. ob.

If you will multiply in Decimals by 10, or by 100, or by 1000, etc. set down
your numbers, and mark how many fractions there be in your multiplicand, and
then ad so many ciphers as your multiplier has to the right hand, and cut off
your prime line, and the work is ended, as in this example.

Example. ^

How to change any fraction given into Decimalls.
Admit there be a quotient of a division, which is 358 pound, 126255 of one
pound, which fraction you would turn into Demalls; add a cipher to your
numerator of your fraction, makes 1260: but because your number will not be
euenly divided by your denominator 255, therefore add more ciphers, and then
divide the number by 255 makes 49411 fifths in Decimals to be joined with the
whole numbers 35849411 fifthes, and are now fit for multiplication and division
in Decimals.

5. Example.

^

Admit there be a fraction to be set out in Decimals thus, it is required to
know what 156 yards of cloth will cost at 196: 784 of a pound one yard? Add to
156, 2, 3, or more ciphers, and divide by the denominator 784, makes 25
seconds, by which multiply 156 yards, makes 39 pound.

6. Example.

^

7. Example.

For the proof of this work, multiply 156 by 196, makes 30576; which divided
by 784, makes 39 pound, as before.

^

CHAP. V. Division in Decimalls.
IF you will divide any number in Decimals, either whole numbers by fractions,
or fractions by whole numbers, or whole numbers and fractions by whole numbers
and fractions; set them down according to the Rules in Decimalls in the
operations before going. As for example, a certain Merchant bought as much
cloth as cost him 284 pound, 5 shillings, at 7 shillings, 6 pence an ell, the
question is, how many else he had for his money? To do this, or any other the
like question; divide your sum of money 284 pound, 5 shillings by 7
shillings, 6 pence, and the quotient will show you, what number of else, and
parts of an ell, if any be, were bought for that money.

1. Example. ^

How to Divide the smaller number by the greater.
If you will divide 34 pound, 6 shillings amongst 36 men: place your numbers,
adding, 3, or 4, or 5 ciphers; and then divide by 36, makes 95271 fifthes; or
in Coin 19 shillings, 0 pence, ob. for every man's portion.

2. Example. ^

What is the quotient of 724 pound? Divided by 34 of a unit, or 15 shillings?
Answer: divide 724 by 75 seconds, makes 965 13; for trial whereof multiply 965
13 by 15 shillings, or 75 seconds, makes 724, as in the Example.

2. Example. ^

This last question is in effect no other but as the former: for if I shall
say, a merchant buys Broad Cloth, costs him 724 pound at 15 shillings, or 34
of a pound one yard, the question is, what number he had for his money, and by
Division I find he had 965 yards, and one third part of a yard, as is proved in
the example; and so dividing 724 by 34, the quotient is 965, 13

3. Example.

If you will divide the product of the second example in multiplication, which
was 559^^53125 seuenths by 16325 for the proof of that work, which ought to
bring out the multiplicand 34^2625; or rather if you will divide 559 pound, 6
shillings, 8 pence, ob. almost, by 16 pound, 6 shillings, 6 pence, the quotient
will be 34 pound, 5 shillings, 3 pence.

Example. ^

How to find the Prime line in any Division decimall, or to find the true
denomination of of the Quotient.
In any division decimall, always mark out your prime line in your dividend
with a straight do vne line with the pen, then set your Decimall fractions in
primes, seconds, thirds, fourths, etc. beyond the line; also do the like in
your divisor, and then mark how often you may remove your divisor, that the
whole numbers of your divisor may stand under the whole numbers of your
dividend, and so many figures shall your quotiont have in whole numbers, the
rest are to be marked with pricks in the quotient for primes, seconds thirds,
etc.

If you will divide 93861375 fifthes by 34 pound 35 seconds, then place them
with pricks as in the example following. I find having placed my divisor
underneath my dividend, that I may remove my divisor twice under the whole
numbers of my dividend, and therefore I conclude, the first two numbers of my
quotient will be whole numbers, which I mark from the rest of the numbers in
the quotient with a line, and then dividing according to the former
instruction, you shall find the quotient will be 27 pound, 3 primes, 2
seconds, and 5 thirds.

Example. ^

2. Example.

If you would divide 15554 pound, 2 primes, 5 seconds, or 5 shillings, by 45
pound? Place them as in the Example following, and you shall find, that there
will be in the quotient 3 figures in whole numbers, and the rest will be primes
and seconds, so that dividing of 15554 pound, 5 primes by 45 pound, the
quotient is 345 pound, 13 shillings.

Example. ^

3. Example.

If the greatest number of your Divisor be primes, then the figures of your
whole numbers in the quotient will be, once greater in value; then the times
you can remove your Divisor, as if you would divide 241 pound, 5 primes, by 7
primes: then whereas you can remove your divisor by two times under the whole
numbers 241, yet you shall have 3 numbers in the quotient in whole numbers,
because your first figure of your divisor is primes; so that in dividing 241
pound, 5 primes by 7 primes, I find the quotient will be 345 pound, or
integers; and so many yards, at 14 shillings a yard, which is 7 primes, will 241
pound, 10 shillings buy.

Example. ^

4. Example.

If you will divide 16 pound, 875 thirds, which is 16 pound, 17 shillings, 6
pence by 375 thirds, which is 7 shillings, 6 pence, or which is all one,
imagine there is as much cloth of 7 shillings, 6 pence a yard, as cost 16
pound, 17 shillings, 6 pence; the question is, how many yards was bought for
that money? placing your numbers as in the example following, I find 45 yards
is the answer to the question.

Example. ^

5. Example.

If you will divide whole numbers and fractions by whole numbers, place the
whole numbers and fractions uppermost, and mark out your prime line, and then
set your divisor underneath, and the lowest figure in value of your divisor,
will show you what is the denomination of the first figure of your quotient. As
if you will divide 13 pound 95 seconds by 45; or which is all one if you shall
say; if 45 pieces of figgs cost me 16 pound, 19 shillings, what did one piece
cost? Divide 1395 seconds by 45, makes 31 seconds, or 6 shillings, 2 pence, 25
of a penny for the price of one piece. And in this sort the price of any number
of yards, else, or pounds being given in dividing it by the number of yards,
else, or pounds, the quotient will be the price of one; and by this Rule you
save a labor of Reduction, always dividing the price by the number given, the
greater by the lesser, or the lesser by the greater.

Example. ^

6. Example.

If 456 else of cloth cost 575 pound, 7 primes, what will one ell cost? Divide
575 pound, 7 primes by 456 else, makes 1 pound 2625 fourths, or in Coin, 1
pound, 5 shillings, 3 pence for the price of one ell.

^

Reduction in Decimals.
If you will reduce 75 pound, 12 shillings, 9 pence into Decimals, enter your
Decimal Table, and for 12 shillings find 6 primes; then look for 9 pence, and
you shall find 375 fourths; so the total is 75 pound, 6375 fourths and are now
fit and apt for any Decimall operation.

If you multiply or divide 84 pound, 13 shillings, 6 pence, by 17 pound, 3
shillings, reduce them into Decimals by the Table, makes for 84 pound, 13
shillings, 6 pence 84675, and for 17 pound, 3 shillings, 1715, and are now fit
to be multiplied or divided one by the other.

If you will reduce 189756 parts of one pound into Decimals: divide 189, adding
3 ciphers to it by 756 makes 25 seconds for that fraction in Decimalls: and now
for example, If 158 else of cloth and 189756 parts of an ell cost 79 pound, 2
shillings, 6 pence, what will 640 else cost at that rate? Now according to
vulgar Arithmatick, either I must reduce 158 else 189756 parts of an ell into
756 parts, or otherwise I must Reduce the fraction into his least terms, makes
14; then I multiply or reduce 158 else into fourths, makes 633 fourths for the
first number in the Golden Rule. Secondly, reduce 79 pound, 2 shilling, 6 pence
into pence, makes 18990 pence for the second number; then put 640 else into
fourths, makes 2560 fourths; then multiply ^8990 by 2560, makes 48614400; which
divide by 633, makes 320 pound.

Example. ^

The same example wrought by Decimalls.

If 158 else 14 ell cost 79 pound, 2 shilling 6 pence, what will 640 else cost
at that rate? Place them in Decimals thus: If 15825 seconds cost 79125 thirds,
what 640 else? Multiply 79125 thirds by 640, makes 50640000; which divide by
15825, makes 320 pound the quotient.

Example. ^

Or otherwise.

Divide 15825 by 79125, adding one cipher, makes 2 primes for the Quotient;
wherefore I conclude, that one half of 640 pound, which is 320 pound, is the
answer to the question demanded. Also divide 7912^ by 15825, the quotient is 5
primes; by which multiply 640 pound, makes 320 pound for the answer to the
question as before.

If a Phillips Dollar be worth 4 shillings, 8 pence, what are 465342 Dollars
worth in sterling money? Answer multiply 465342 by primes, which is 4
shillings, and take the sixth part of that product, and add into it, makes
1085798 primes for the answer.

Or otherwise, multiply by 2 primes, and 13 of a prime, because 8 pence is 13
of a prime, and both ways will produce the same answer.

Example. ^

If a common Dollar be worth 4 shillings, and a Princes Dollar be worth 4
shillings, 6 pence, how many Princes Dollars will pay for 7584 common Dollars?
Multiply 7584 by 4 shillings, and divide by 4 shillings, 6 pence, makes 6741
Dollars, and 7 seconds, and 5 thirds will remain, which is 18 pence; so that I
conclude, 6741 Princes Dollars at 4 shillings, 6 pence a piece will pay for
7584 common Dollars, and there will remain 18 pence.

Example. ^

In 654 pound, how many Dollars of 3 shillings a piece? Add two Ciphers to
654, makes 65400, because 3 shillings has 2 fractions in Decimals, viz. primes
and seconds, which is 1 prime and 5 seconds, by which divide 65400, makes 4360
Dollars at 3 shillings a piece.

Example. ^

In 756 pound how many Dollars of 3 shillings, 9 pence a piece? Add 4 Ciphers
to 756, makes 7560000; which divide by 1875, which is 3 shillings, 9 pence in
Decimals, makes 4032 Dollars. Behold the example following*

Example. ^

If I do sell 346 yards of Velvet for 298 pound, 8 shillings, 6 pence, how do
I sell one yard? Answer: divide the price by the quantity of yards in
decimals, makes 8625 fourths, or in Coin 17 shillings, 3 pence for the price
of one yard.

Example. ^

Makes 17 s. 3 d. a yard.

A Merchant would buy several sorts of Spices of several prices, to wit, of 3
shillings a pound of 2 shillings, of 2 shillings 3 pence, of 1 shillings 7
pence, and of 2 shillings, 2 pence a pound, and would have of each a like
quantity; for 324 pound, the question is, how many pound he must have of
each? First, add all the prices into one sum, makes 11 shillings, by which
divide 324 pound, makes 584 pound, 111 of a pound; and so many pound must he
have of each sort.

A Goldsmith sent his servant to the Tower of London, to fetch him 415 pound,
18 shillings, 9 pence in pieces of 6 pence, of 4 pence, of 3 pence, of 2 pence,
of 1 penny, and of one half penny, and bad him bring of each sort a like
quantity: First, add all your Coin, makes 16 pence half penny, which in
Decimals is 6875 fifths by which divide 4157375 fourths, makes 6050 pieces of
each sort.

Example. ^

Rules of Practice in Decimalls.
Set your price given in the Decimall Table of a unite, be it yard, ell, piece,
or pound, and by the price given, multiply the number of yards else, pieces, or
pounds, and the product will be the sum that you seek, if you do but mark
out the prime line, as shall appear by examples following.

1. Example.

If one pound weight of small Ginger cost 7 pence halfpenny, what will 112
pound weight cost? Find for 7 pence halfpenny 3125 fifths, which multiply by
112 pound, makes 350000; from which cut off five figures to the right hand by
the prime line, and the sum is 3 pound, 5 primes, or 3 pound, 10 shillings,
because your multiplicand has 5 fractions.

Example. ^

How to find the price of any unite in any place of 10, or 100, or 1000, the
price of one being given.
If the price of a unite be given at any rate, and from thence you desire to
know, what 10, or 100, or 1000, or 10000 will cost at that rate: or otherwise,
if you desire to know, if you do gain any rate desired by the pound, and
would know at what rate it will be in the 100 pound, or upon exchange from
place to place, the exchange of one pound being given, you desire to know, what
100 pound will amount unto? Place your rate or gains given in Decimalis by
help of the Table, and then adding of one, two, three, or more Ciphers,
cutting off your prime line, you shall know your desire, marking the
denominations of your fractions, if the least to the left hand be primes,
seconds, thirds, fourths, fifthes, cutting off your prime line so many figures
from the right hand.

2. Example.

If one pound sterling be 1 pound, 14 shillings, 3 pence Flemish, what is 100
pound sterling worth? Place 1 pound, 14 shillings, 3 pence in decimals, makes
17125 fourths: then because 100 pound has 2 Ciphers, makes 1712500: then
cutting off 4 figures to the right hand, you shall find 171 pound, 5 shillings
for 100 pound sterling, to make as appears before.

If one ell of Cambrick cost 7 shillings, 6 pence, ^ farthings, what will 100
else cost at that rate? Place 7 shillings, 6 pence, 3 farthings in Decimals,
makes 378125 fixths, and adding two Ciphers for 100, makes 37812500: from which
cut off 6 figures to the right hand, makes 37 pound, 16 shillings 3 pence for
the sum that 100 else will cost.

^

Makes 37 l. 16 s. 3 d.

If one pound or piece cost 1 pound, 2 shillings, 3 pence, what will 1000
pieces cost? Set 1 d. 2 s. three pence, in Decimalls makes 11125 fourths: to
the which add 3 Ciphers, because 1000 has 3 Ciphers, and from the total cut
off 4 figures, makes 1112 pound, 10 shillings, as is in the 4 example above

If one ell of Holland cost 3 shillings, 3 pence, what will 343 else cost?
Multiply 343 by 3 shillings, 3 pence in Decimalls, which is 1625 fourths, makes
55 pound, 14 shillings, 9 pence.

^

If one yard of Velvet cost 15 shillings, 6 pence, what will 972 yards cost?
Find for 15 shillings 75 seconds; then for 6 pence find 25 thirds, total is 775
thirds; by which multiply 972, makes 753 pound, 6 shillings, as above in the
sixth Example.

If one yard of Velvet cost 17 s. 7 d. 3 q. what will 857 yards cost? First,
find 17 ^. to be 85 seconds; then 7 d. 3 q. makes 322916, total is 8822916;
which multiply by 857, makes 756 l. 2 s. 5 d. 3 q.

^

If one Dollar be worth 4 shillings, 9 pence what are 758 Dollars worth in
sterling money? Multiply 4 shillings, 9 pence, which is 2375 fourths by 758,
makes 180 pound, 6 pence, as in the eighth example above.

The price of any number of yards, else, pieces, or pounds given to find the
price of a unite.
If the price of any number of yards, else, pieces, or pounds be given, set
them down in Decimals, adding one, two, or more Ciphers, if need require, and
divide that sum, or price by the number of the yards, else, pounds, or pieces,
and the quotient is the price of a unite in whole numbers, primes, seconds, and
thirds, without reduction, as shall appear by examples following: and in this
manner you may know what sum of money was lent, if the principal and
interest be given at any rate in the hundred; or you may know if the rate of
one pound exchange be given for any place, you may know the value of 100 of
that Coin in that money given; and by this Rule is to be abreuiated almost al
operations of Arithmatick, by finding the value of a unite in any place desired.

If ^42 else of cloth cost 22 pound 4 pence halfpenny, what cost one ell at
that rate? Divide 2201875 fifthes by 542, makes 40625 sixths, or in Coin 9
pence 3 farthings for the price one ell cost.

1. Example. ^

If 345 pound gain 76 pound, 12 shillings, what does one pound gain? Divide
76600000 by 345 pound, makes 222028 sixth, or in Coin, makes 4 shillings, 5
pence half penny almost, that 1 pound does gain as in the example following.

2. Example. ^

If 756 pound, 3 quarters, 24 pound of sugar cost 4421 pound 12 shillings, what
did one pound weight cost, accounting 112 pound to the hundred? Reduce 756
pound 3 quarters, 24 pound into pounds subtle, accounting 112 pound to the
hundred, makes 84780 pound^ then divide 4421 pound, 12 shillings by 84780,
makes 5215 fifths, or 12 pence, halfpenny one pound.

3. Example. ^

If I sell 1000 pieces of Cambricke for 700 pound, how do I sell one piece?
Divide 1000 by 100, makes 1 pound, 42857 fifthes, 1 pound, 8 shillings, 6
pence, 3 farthings, as in the Example following.

4. Example. ^

If one pound starling be 1 pound, 14 shillings, 3 pence Flemish, what is one
pound Flemish worth: Divide one pound with Ciphers by 17125, makes 11
shillings, 8 pence, 1 farthing almost.

5. Example. ^

If 1 l. sterling be 1 l. 14 s. 7 d. ob. Flemish, what is 100 l. Flemish worth
in sterling money? Divide 100 by 173125 fifths, which is 1 l. 14 s. 7 d. ob. in
Decimals, makes 57 l. 15 s. 3 d.

6. Example. ^

The Golden Rule in Decimalls.
If the number given be pounds, shillings and pence, set them out in Decimals,
and also your number of yards, else, pieces, pounds or any other numbers, set
them out also in Decimals, and then without reduction multiply the third number
by the second, and divide by the first, according to the instructions of
multiplication and Division in the former part of this book, and the uotient
will be the third number sought.

1. Example.

If 34 else of Canuas cost 1 pound, 4 shillings, what will 756 else cost at
that rate? Multiply 756 by 1 pound, 2 primes, makes 9072 primes; which divided
by 34, adding Ciphers, makes 266823 fourth, or in Coin 26 pound, 13 shillings,
8 pence.

Example. ^

If 112 pound of Indico cost 34 pound, 17 shillings, what cost 789 pound,
subtle accounting 100 pound to the hundred? Multiply 3485 seconds by 789,
makes 27496 pound, 65 seconds; which divided by 112 pound, makes 245 pound,
5058 fourths, or 10 shillings, 1 penny farthing.

Example. ^

If 981 else of Cloth cost 94 pound, 13 shillings, 6 pence, what cost 2943
else at that rate? Divide the third number by the first, and by the quotient
multiply the second, and the product will be the answer sought.

^

If 112 pound of Sugar cost 5 pound, 3 shillings, 9 pence, how many pounds will
124 pound buy at that rate? Divide 51875 fourths by 112 pound, to find the
price of 1 pound, makes 46316, sixths, or in Coin 1^ d. 110 of a penny almost
for the price that one pound cost Secondly, divide 124 pound by the price of
one pound, viz. by by 46316 sixths, makes 26773 primes, and so many pound he
shall have for 124 pound.

If one yard Broad Cloth cost 16 shillings, 9 pence, how many yards shall 56
pound buy at that rate? Divide 56 pound by 16 shillings, 9 pence, the price of
one yard, makes 66 yards, 910 almost.

Example. ^

If 7 yards 12 of cloth cost 9 shillings, what will 8 yards 13 of a yard cost?
Multiply 9 shillings, or 45 seconds by 8 13, makes 375; which divide by 7 yards
1:^, or by 75 primes, makes 5 primes, or 10 shillings.

Example. ^

If 5 yards 12 cost 4 shillings, 8 pence, 14 of a penny, or 56, 14, what will
30 yardes cost at that rate? set your 56 pence 14 in Decimals, makes 5625
seconds, which multiply by 30, makes 168750 seconds; which divided by 5 yards
on half, or 55 primes, makes 306 pence 810 of one penny for the price of 30
yards, as in the example following.

Example. ^

If 34 else 34 of Holland cost 3 pound, 6 shillings, 1 penny, half penny, what
will 956 else 12 cost at that rate? Multiply 3 pound, 6 shillings, 1 penny,
half penny, which is 33625 fourths by 7565 prime^, makes 254373125; which
divided by 34 else, 34, or by 3475, makes 73200 thirds or 73 pound, 4 shillings.

Example. ^

If 346 pound, 10 shillings gain 32 pound 8 shillings, what will 75 pound
gain at that rate? First, multiply 324 primes by 75 makes 24300 prime; which
divided by 3465 primes, makes 70129 fourths, or 7 pound, 3 pence for the
answer.

Example. ^

The same Question wrought a second way.
Divide 324 primes, by 3465 primes, adding 5 ciphers, and the quotient will be
935 fourths; which multiply by 75, makes 7 l. 0125 fourths, which does not want
one farthing of the former sum.

The same Question wrought another way.
Divide 75 pound, adding 5 Ciphers by 346 pound, 5 primes, and the quotient
will be 21645 fifths; which multiply by 324 primes, makes 7012980; from which
abate 6 figures to the right hand, because of your 6 f^^ctions and the remainer
will be 7 pound 01^9 fourths, etc. as before. And in this manner you may work
any question in the Rule of Three, three several manner of ways, and prove
the work one by the other.

If 12 shillings do buy 74 pound of Ginger, how much shall I have for 100
pound? Divide 7400, which is the product of 74 by 100, by 12 shillings, or 6
primes, and the quotient will be 12333 pound, 13, and so much Ginger shall I
have for 100 pound at that rate. Or otherwise, divide 100 pound by 6 primes,
makes 166 23, which multiply by 74, makes 12333 pound, 13, as before.

Brief Rules how to abreuiate your work in the Golden Rule, by marking the
proportions bebetweene the numbers given.
When as any question is propounded in the Golden Rule, mark what proportion
is between the first and second numbers, or between the first and third
numbers, or between the third and second; for if you epsy them in any
proportion, the question demanded is very speedily answered, upon the first
sight; or yet if you see them not exactly to be even proportionals, yet you may
subtract the first from the third, once twice or three times, or more and so
often take the middle number toward the answer to the question, and then you
need not to multiply by your whole third number, as you shall see by examples
following.

1. Example.

If 34 else cost 2 pound, 4 shillings, 1 penny, what will 340 else cost? Here
comparing the first and third numbers, one with another, I find the third does
contain the first 10 times, wherefore I multiply 2 pound 4 shillings, 1 penny
by 10, and the total is 22 pound, 10 pence, the Answer.

2. Example.

If 82 else of Cloth cost 4 pound, 2 shillings, what will 324 else cost at that
rate? Here I find 4 pound, 2 shilling in Decimals to be one half of 82, but it
stands one room less in value then 82 does, so I conclude, that half of
324 one room less is 16 pound, 2 primes, or 4 shillings, the Answer.

3. Example.

If 345 else of Holland cost 34 pound, 10 shillings, what will 789 else cost at
that rate? Set down 34 pound, 10 shillings in Decimalls, makes 34 pound, 5
primes, which is the first number placed but one room lower; therefore I say,
if 345 else cost 34 pound, 5 primes one room more to the right hand, then the
third number also will cost 78 pound, 9 primes one room more to the right
hand, which is 78 pound, 18 shillings.

4. Example.

If 12 else of Cloth cost 2 shillings, four pence, 45 of one penny, what will
356 else cost? place 2 shillings, 4 pence, 45 in Decimals, makes 1 prime, 2
seconds, or 12 seconds, which is the same number: but it stands two rooms
lower; therefore I conclude, that 356 else cost the same numbers two rooms
lower, which is 3 pound, 11 shillings, 2 pence, 25 of one penny.

^

5. Example.

If 130 else of cloth cost 26 pound, what will 3759 else cost at that rate? I
find the second number to be twice the first, but it stands one place nearer
the right hand; therefore I conclude, that the third number will cost twice
as much in his lower room, which is 751 pound, 16 shillings.

If 130 cost 26 pound, what cost 3759.

^

6. Example.

If 75 else one half co^^ 7 pound, 11 shillings, what will 32812 seconds cost?
Set them down in Decimalls, and you shall find them to stand thus, 755 primes
for the first number, and 755 seconds for the second number, which is the same
one room nearer the right hand: so I conclude, that the third number will cost
3285 seconds, which is 32 pound 17 shillings.

Example. ^

1. Example.

If 356 else of Canuas cost 38 pound, 12 shillings, 1 penny, what will 740 else
cost at that rate? First, divide 740 by 356, the quotient will be 2 and
therefore I take twice the price given for that quotient, and then whereas
before I should have multiplied 38 pound, 12 shillings, 1 penny by 740, I shall
need to multiply it but by 28 the remaynor, and divide it by 356, makes 30368
fourths, to be a^ded to the former sum, and the total will be as in the
example following.

Example. ^

^

Here in this last example, I multiply 38 pound, 6 primes by 28, omitting the
penny, not setting it out in decimals, and the product is 10809 primes: then
multiply 1 penny by 28, makes 28 pence, which is one prime, 166 fourths, and
the total was 1080 pound, 9116 fourths, as in the example: and in this manner
you may save a great labor in multiplying your number of pounds and shillings
first, and then multiply your pence by themselves, and add into the rest in
primes, seconds, etc.

2. Example.

If 17 else of Holland Cloth cost 3 pound 2 shillings, 5 pence, what will 515
else cost at that rate? Divide 515 by 17, makes 30, by which multiply 3 pound,
2 shillings, 5 pence, makes 93 pound, 12 shillings, 6 pence, then the remayner
of your division will be 5 else, by which 5 multiply 3 pound, 2 shillings, 5
pence, makes 15 l. 10 shillings, 1 penny, or in Decimals 1550416 fifthes; which
divided by 17, makes 912 thirds, or 18 shillings, 3 pence almost; which added
to 93 pound, 12 shillings, 6 pence, makes the answer to be 94 pound, 10
shillings, 9 pence: and so here in stead of multiplying 3120833 sixths by 515,
and dividing by 17 I have saved more then half the work.

Example. ^

3. Example.

If 7 pound buy 100 pound weight of Sugar, how many pound weight will 156 buy
me at that rate? Divide 156 by 7, makes 22, 27; by which multiply 100, makes
2228 pound, 47

4. Example.

If 356 pieces of Callicoes cost 300 pound, 15 shillings, how much will 917
pieces cost at that rate? Divide 917 by 356, makes in the quotient 2; therefore
take the price given twice, and there will remain after your division 205; by
which multiply 30075 seconds, makes 6165375 seconds; which divided by 356,
makes 173 pound, 18 seconds, or 173 pound, 3 shillings 8 pence, to be added to
the former sum 601 pound, 10 shillings, makes 774 pound 13 shillings, 8
pence, for the Question.

The same question wrought without Reduction in Decimals.
If 356 cost 30075 seconds, what 917? Multiply 30075 second by 917, makes
27578775 seconds; which divide by 356, makes 77468 seconds, or 774 pound, 13
shillings, 8 pence, as before the proof.

Example. ^

5. Example.

If 179 pound of Indico cost 60 pound 13 shillings, 5 pence, what will 716
pound cost at the same rate? divide 716 by 179, makes 4 in the quotient, and
nothing will remain: wherefore I conclude, that 4 times 60l. 13 ^. 5 d. which
is 242l. 13 s. 8 d. and is the answer to the question demanded.

6. Example.

If 36 pound of Cloves cost 11 pound, 6 shillings, how many pound shall I have
for 354l. Divide 113 primes by 36, makes 31388 fifths; which multiply by 354,
cutting of figures for the 5 fractions, makes 111 pound, 11352 fifthes, or 3
pound, 2 shillings 2 pence, 3 farthings for the answer.

Fellowship in Decimals.
To work the Rule of Fellowship in Decimals, gather the whole number of all
the moneys disbursed into one sum, and then divide the money gained or lost
by that sum, and multiply that quotient so found by each several partners
stock disbursed, and the products will be each several man's gain or loss.

1. Example.

Four Merchants made a company: A. put in 60 pound, B. 80 pound, C. 120 pound,
D. 140 pound, and they gained 72 pound; the Question is, what part each
Merchant must have of the gains? First the total sum of all their moneys
disbursed was 400 pound, wherefore according to the rule I divide 72 pound,
adding Ciphers unto it by 400, and the quotient is 1 prime, 8 seconds; by which
I multiply each several man's Stock disbursed, and I find, A. shall have 10
pound, 16 shillings; B. 14 pound 8 shillings; C. 21 pound 12 shillings, and D.
25 pound, 4 shillings; total is 72 pound, as in the example.

Example. ^

2. Example.

Four Merchants made a company, and set forth a ship to sea, which cost them
3616 pound, 13 shillings; A. must pay 13 of the money; B. 14, C. 15, D. 16, the
question is, what each man must pay of the said sum? Take a a number wherein
the like parts may be had which in the former book of vulgar Arithmatick, I
find to be 60, whereof 13 is 20 and 14 is 15, and 15 is 12* and 16 is 10, the
total is but 57: wherefore I divide 361665 by 57, and the quotient is 6345
seconds; which I multiply by 20, and I find A shall pay 1269 pound; then I
multiply by 15, and B. shall pay 95175 second; and by 12, and C. shall pay 7614
primes; and by 10, and D. shall pay 6345 primes, the total is 361665 seconds,
the proof of the work.

Example. ^

3. Example.

^ Three Merchants made a Company: A. put in 566 primes; B put in 398 primes;
C. put in 1204 primes, and they gained 58 pound, 16 shillings, or 58 pound, 8
primes, what must each man have of the gains; first, the total disbursed is
216 pound, 4 primes; by the which I divide 58 pound, 8 primes, and the quotient
is 27197 fifthes for one pound gains; which I multiply by each several man's
money disbursed, and I find A. shall have 15 pound, 7 shillings* 10 pence half
penny; B. 10 pound, 14 shillings, 3 pence, 3 farthings; C. shall have 32 pound,
13 shillings, 9 pence, 3 farthings, the total is 58 pound, 16 shillings, the
proof.

Example. ^

4. Example.

Three Captains agree together to divide a spoil or booty, which they had
taken, containing 7851 li: in this sort, A. is to have 12; B. 13; C. 14; the
question is, what each man's share shall be? Find a number which has such parts
in it, viz. 12, whereof 12 is 6, 13 is 4, and 14 is 3, which in one sum makes
13; therefore divide 7851, adding ciphers to it by 13, and the quotient will be
603 pound, 92307 fifthes; which multiply by 6, 4, and 3, and you shall find, A.
shall have 3623 pound, 5384* fifths; B. shall have 2415 pound, 69228 fifths; C.
shall have 1811 pound, 76921 fifths; the Total is 7850 pound, 99991 fifths,
which does want but 1 fourth of 7851 pound, which in value is but 3: 125 parts
of 1 penny, and this example is to be wrought without the Golden Rule. Behold
the proof of the work.

Example. ^

The same example wrought another way.
After you have divided 7851 pound by 13, find in your Decimall Table what the
quotient is in Coin, makes 603 pound, 18 shillings, 5 pence, ob. which
multiply by 6 4, and 3, and their total in one sum is the answer, as before.

^

^

These three several products added into one sum, makes 7850 l. 19 s. 11 d.
wanting but one penny in the whole sum, which is the defect of the Decimals,
which cannot be exactly set out in coin, but it will serve to answer a
question of one million with one penny error at the most.

5. Example.

Three men made a stock together, and they gained 244 pound, 8 shillings: A.
put in 315 pound 7 months, B. 408 pound 10 months, C. 500 pound 3 months;
now the question is, what each man must have of the gains? First, multiply
each man's stock by his time, and gather all the totals into one sum, and
they make 7785; by which divide your gains, 244 pound, 4 primes, and the
quotient will be 31393 sixths; which multiply by the several products of each
man's money and time, and the total of each several product is the sum
desired for each man's part of the gain.

Example. ^

Position in Decimals.
The Merchants bought a parcel of Linen Cloth cost them 757 pound, 17
shillings whereof A. must pay 14; B. 15; C. 18; what must each man pay of this
sum? I take 20 for a number, wherein I can have those parts, viz. 14 of 20 is
5, and 15 of 20 is 4, and 18 of 20 is 2 pound 5 primes, or 2 one half, their
total is 11 pound, 5 primes, or 11 12; by which I divide 757 pound, 85
seconds, and the quotient is 65 l. 9 primes, which I multiply by 5 for A. makes
329 pound, 10 shillings; B. 263 pound, 12 shillings; C. 164 pound, 15
shillings: the total is 757 pound, 85 seconds.

2. Example.

A Ship-carpenter bought 300 timber trees of a Gentleman, and was to pay for
the first 100 a sum of money unknown, for the second twice as much as for the
first 100, and for the third 100 of trees he was to pay thrice as much as he
paid for the first, and the whole ^00 of trees cost him 7^4 pound, 12
shillings, the question is, what each hundred cost him severally? To work this
question, or any other of like nature, suppose a unite, or one pound for the
first 100, then he must pay 2 pound for the second 100, which is twice as much,
and then also he must pay 3 pound for the third hundred, which is three times
as much as the first: but yet 1 pound, 2 pound, and 3 pound makes but 6 pound,
and it should be 724 pound, 12 shillings; so that now whereas in the former
Book I taught you to resort to the Golden Rule for the answer, saying; If 6
pound come of my position 1 pound, of what comes 724 pound, 12 shillings. Now
always supposing a unite* for your first number, you shall save
multiplication; and so dividing of 724 pound, 6 primes by 6, I find the first
100 of Trees cost him 120 pound, 15 shillings, 4 pence; and the second 100 cost
him 241 pound, 10 shillings 8 pence; and the third 100 cost him 362 pound, 5
shillings; the total makes 724 pound, 12 shillings, behold the work.

Example. ^

3. Example.

Four Merchants consent to build a ship, cost them 541 pound, 16 shillings,
whereof A. must pay a certain sum of money unknown; B. must pay twice as
much as A; C. must pay twice as much as B; and D. must pay as much as all the
other three, viz. as A. B. and C.; now the question is, what each man must pay
of this sum. I suppose A. must pay 1 pound, then B. must pay 2 pound, which
is twice as much as A. does pay; and C. must pay 6 pound, which is thrice as
much as B. does pay; and then D. must pay 9 pound, which is as much as all the
other three do pay: but their total is but 18 pound, and it should be 541
pound, 16 shillings: wherefore I divide 541 pound, 8 primes by 18, and the
quotient is 30 pound, 1 prime, or 2 shillings for the first part. Then B. must
pay 60 pound, 4 shillings? C. 180 pound, 12 shillings; and D. 270 pound, 18
shillings, their total makes 541 pound, 8 primes; behold the work.

Example. ^

4. Example.

A Cesterne of water containing 600 gallons is filled with water, and has 4
several Cocks to empty the same, whereof if they be all set open at once, the
Cesterne will be empty in 24 hours: now the second Cock will avoid twice as
much as the first Cock in 24 hours, and the third will avoid three times as
much as the first, and the fourth Cock 5 times as much as the first; the
question is, how many gallons each Cock does avoid in 24 hours of the said
600 gallons?

I suppose the first Cock will avoid one gallon, then the second must avoid
2, and the third 3, and the fourth Cock 5: but yet they are but a 11 gallons,
and they should be 600 gallons: wherefore dividing of 600 by 11, the quotient
is 54 gallons, and 611 of a gallon for the first Cock. Behold the work in the
example following.

Of Gain and Loss in Decimals.
If a Broad Cloth 28 yards long be sold for 14 shillings a yard, and the
seller does gain 10* pound in the 100 ready money, what cost that broad
Cloth? First, by Practice find the price of the 28 yards, at 14 shillings a
yard, makes 19 pound, 6 primes, or 19 pound, 12 shillings; divide 19 pound 6
primes by 110 pound, makes 17 pound, 81818 fifthes, or in Coin, 17 pound, 16
shillings, 4 pence, 3 farthings.

1. Example. ^

Secondly, if 28 yards cost 17 pound, 81818 fifthes, what did one yard cost at
that rate? Divide 17 pound, 81818 fifthes by 28 yards, and the quotient will be
63636, or in Coin, 12 shillings, 8 pence, 3 farthings for the price that one
yard cost.

Example. ^

Thirdly, for the proof of this work, say, If one yard cost 63636 fifths, how
may I sell it to gain 10 pound in the hundred ready money? Take the tenth part
of 63636 fifths, makes 63636 sixths; which added into one Total, makes 69999
fifthes, which does want but one fifth of 7 prime^, or 14 shillings, which
proves all the former works to be true.

Example. ^

2 Example.

A Merchant does deliver money at interest for 9 months after the rate of 12
pound in the hundred for 12 months simple interest, and at the end of 9
months does receive for interest 87 pound; the question is, what was the sum
lent? Answer: because the interest of 9 months at 12 pound in the hundred is
9 pound, divide 8700000 by 9 pound, and the quotient is 966 pound, 6666
fourths, or 966 pound, 13 shillings, 4 pence, the sum lent.

Example. ^

3. Example.

If 13 pieces of Canuas cost 17 pound, 12 shillings, how may I sell them to
gain 8 pound in the hundred? Multiply 17 pound 6 primes by 8, adding two
ciphers, makes for 19 pound, 8 thirds, or 19 pound, 2 pence almost.

The proof of the former example, if 17 pound, 12 shillings, gain 1 pound, 8
shillings, 2d. what will 100 pound gain at that rate? Multiply 1 pound, 8
shillings, 2 pence; or in Decimals, 1 pound, 408 thirds by 100, makes 140
pound, 800 thirds; which divide by 17 pound, 6 primes, makes 8 li. for the rate
that 100 pound will gain, which shows the former work to be truly wrought.

Example. ^

4. Example.

If in one ell of cloth sold for 3 shillings, there be gained after the rate
of 12 pound in the hundred for 12 months, how should that ell have been sold
to gain 17 pound in the hundred for 12 months? Multiply 17 pound by 3
shillings, which is 1 prime, 5 seconds, and divide the product by 12, makes
2125 fourths, or in coin 4 shillings 3 pence, and so much must it have been
sold for to gain 17 pound in the hundred.

Example. ^

Secondly, if 3 shillings give 12 pound, what will 4 shillings, 3 pence give?
Multiply 2125 fourths by 12, and divide by 15 seconds, and the quotient is 17
pound, the proof of the last example.

Example. ^

5. Example.

A Merchant sold 24 Clothes, which cost him 342 pound, wherein he lost after
the rate of 10 pound in the hundred, and took in exchange 560 pieces of
Raysons at 24 shillings the piece, wherein he gained 10 pound in the hundred
ready money; now the question is, what his gain or loss was, and what sum
of money he was to pay for the Raysons? First, 560 pieces of Raysons at 24
shillings a piece, is 672 pound; from which subtract 342 pound, lea^es 330
pound to pay for the Raysons. Secondly, 672 pound, at 10 pound in the hundred,
is 67 pound, 4 shillings for his gains by the Raysons. Thirdly, 342 pound
less, 10 in the hundred, is 34 pound, 4 shillings, to be deducted from 342
pound; and then take 34 pound, 4 shillings, from 67 pound 4 shillings, leaves
his gains more then his loss to be 33 pound.

Example. ^

6. Example.

A Merchant receives for principal and interest 352 pound, wherein he gained
9 pound in the hundred for one year; now the question is, what was the sum
of money lent? Divide 35200000 by 109 pound, makes 322 pound, 9357 fourths, o^
322 pound, 18 shillings, 8 pence, halfpenny for the sum le^t.

6. Example.

^

7. Example.

A Merchant has owing unto him, 540 pound, to be paid at the end of three
years, now his debtor will pay him ready money, if he will abate him 9 pound
in the hundred. Divide 540 pound with Ciphers by 109 three times one after the
other, and the third quotient will be the sum that he shall pay in ready
money* abating 9 pound in the hundred interest upon interest. Behold the work
following.

7 Example.

^

The proof is made by multiplying the last quotient by 9, and that product
again by 9, and thirdly again by 9, makes 540 pound, wanting but one fifth,
which is but 31750 parts of 1 penny, or 6875 parts of one farthing.

8. Example.

A Merchant has owing unto him 632 pound, to be paid at the end of 12 months,
now his debtor will pay him ready money, if he will abate him 12 pound in the
hundred per annum? Divide 632 by 112 pound* and the quotient will be the sum
of money that will discharge the debt, abating 12 pound in the hundred.

Example. ^

9. Example.

324 pound was received for interest money lent a Merchant Aduenturer at 17
pound in the hundred one year* what was the sum lent? Answer: divide 32400
by 17, makes 1900 pound, and 117 of a pound.

10. Example.

If 358 else of Holland cast 124 pound, 16 shillings, how shall it be sold an
ell to gain 12 pound in the hundred ready money? First multiply 124 pound, 8
primes by 12, adding two ciphers, makes 139 pound, 776 or in Coin 139 pound,
15 shillings, 6 pence. Secondly, divide 139 pound, 776 by 358, makes 3905
fourths, or 7 shillings, 9 pence, 3 farthings for the price to sell one ell to
gain 12 pound in the hundred.

Example. ^

11. Example.

If one ell of cloth cost 18 pence, how shall I sell 358 else to gain 7 pound,
10 shillings by the bargain. and at what rate in the hundred do I gain?
First, 358 else at 18 pence an ell makes 26 pound, 17 shillings; to the which
add 7 pound, 10 shillings, the gains makes 34 pound, 7 shillings for to sell
358 else, to gain 7 pound, 10 shillings by the bargain. Secondly, divide 7
pound 500000 sixths by 26 pound, 85 seconds, and the quotient is 27 pound, 9346
fourths, or 27 pound, 18 shillings, 8 pence farthing, which is the rate gained
by the 100 pound of money.

Example. ^

12. Example.

How much Indicoe of 6 shillings, 3 pence a pound will pay for 73 broad clothes
at 16 pound one cloth, and to pay 60 pound in present money? First, 73 broad
clothes at 16 pound a cloth makes 1168 pound, from which subtract 60 pound,
there will remain 1108 pound; which divide by 6 shillings, 3 pence, or 3125
fourths, and the quotient is 3545 pound, 910 of one pound, and so much must he
give of Indicoe for the clothes.

Example. ^

13. Example.

How many pounds of Cloves at 6 shillings a pound, and small Sinamond of 3
shillings a pound must be given for 36 Carseyes, at 4 pound, 3 shillings a
piece, to have of each a like number of pounds? Answer: 36 Carseys at 4 pound,
3 shillings a piece, makes 149 pound, 8 shillings; which divided by the price
of both, viz. 9 shillings, makes 332 pound of each sort.

The proof: 332 pound of Cloves at 6 shillings a pound, makes 99 pound, 12
shillings; then 332 pound of Sinamon at 3 shillings, a pound, makes 49 pound,
16 shillings, the total is 149 pound, 8 shillings, the given price of the 36
Carseys.

Example. ^

14. Example.

Of what principal came 1000 pound principal and interest, at compound
interest in three years at 6 pound in the hundred? Divide 1000 pound three
several times by 106, makes 839 pound 61 seconds, or 839 pound, 12 shillings,
3 pence almost, which was the sum lent at first.

Example. ^

15. Example.

If 34 Tun of wine cost 544 pound, how may a man sell a Tun to gain 12 pound
upon the hundred ready money? First, find the price of one Tun, dividing 544 by
34, makes 16 pound for the price of one Tun which it cost; then multiply 1600
by 12 pound, makes 17 pound, 92 seconds, or 17 pound, 18 shillings, 4 pence, 45
of a penny, for the price to sell one Tun of that Wine to gain 12 pound upon
the 100 pound.

How to work gain and loss in pence, and parts of Pence or Farthsngs.
Set out your number of pounds, shillings, pence and farthings in pence, and in
tenths of one penny; and for one farthing, set out 2 primes, 5 seconds, which
is one fourth of a penny, and for two farthings set out five primes, which is
one half penny; and for three farthings set down 7 primes, 5 seconds, which
is three quarters of one penny, and then they are apt for decimall operations
both for multiplication, division, or any other work of Arithmatick, without
reducing them into farthings, and there will be a great deal of labor saved
in these kinds of operations, as shall appear afterward by the examples
following.

1. Example.

What is the interest and principal of 100 pound, put forth at 10 pound in the
100 compound interest, for the space of 7 years to be all received at the end
of the term? First, put your 100 pound into pence, maker 24000 pence; then
work as in this example following, and you shall find it will amount unto 46769
pence, and 15 of one penny; which divided by 240 pence, makes 194 pound, 17
shillings, 5 pence, 15 of a penny, which is the sum that 100 pound will
amount unto at interest upon interest in 7 years at 10 pound in the hundred.

Example. ^

^

2 Example.

A Merchant delivered 358 pound at interest for three years for 8 pound in the
hundred compound interest; the question is, what it will amount unto at the end
of the term? Put your money into pence, makes 85920 pence; which multiply by
8, adding 2 Ciphers, and work for three years, as in the example following.

Example. ^

^

The proof of the former example in Decimals.
A certain Merchant received for principal and interest upon interest 450
pound 19 shillings, 6 pence, which was for money lent at 8 pound in the hundred
for three years; now the Question is, what was the sum lent? Place 450
pound, 19 shillings, 6 pence in Decimals, and you will find your third quotient
will be 358 pound, wanting some few seconds, which proves the work good.

3. Example.

A Merchant lent 112 pound for 6 months at 17 pound in the hundred, for 12
months, the question is, what he shall receive? Put your money into pence,
makes 26880 pence; mark out your prime line, as in the former examples, and
add two ciphers, then multiply by 17, and take half that product for 6
months interest, and add into the principal, and the total is the sum of
pence which he shall receive for principal and interest at 6 months end.

Example* ^

Makes 121 li. 10 s. 4 d. 45 of a d.

4. Example.

If a pound of Sinamond cost 4 shillings ready money, how may it be sold to
gain 12 pound in the hundred to give 6 months time? Set your 4 shillings in
pence, makes 48 pence; then add 2 Ciphers, and multiply by half the interest,
and add them into one sum, and the product will be 50 pound, 88 seconds, or
4 shillings, 2 pence, 225 of one penny for the price to sell one pound to gain
12 pound in the hundred for 6 months time.

4. Example.

^

Makes 50 pence, 910 of a penny almost.

5. Example.

If 112 pound weight of Clou^s cost 33 pound, 12 shillings, how may I sell them
to gain 14 pound in the hundred, and give 4 months time? First, set down 33
pound, 6 primes; then add 2 Ciphers, and multiply by 14, makes 4 pound, 704
thirds, of which take the third part, because 4 months is the third part of
one year, which is 1 pound, 568 thirds; which added into one total, makes 35
pound, 3 shillings, 4 pence, halfpenny for the price to sell 112 pound to give
4 months time, and to gain 14 pound in the 100 in 12 months

5. Example. ^

6. Example.

If I gain 8 pound, 15 shillings in 100 pieces of Linen cloth, what do I
gain in the 100 at that rate, when as the 100 pieces are sold for 52 pound 10
shillings? First, subtract 8 pound, 15 shillings, from 52 l. 10 s. and there
will remain 43 l. 15 s. then say, If 43 pound, 15 shillings gain 8 pound, 15
shillings, what will 100 pound gain? Divide 8750000 by 43 pound, 15 shillings,
or 43 pound, 75 seconds, and the quotient will be 17 l. 14 s. 4 d. in the 100.

7. Example.

If in 112 pound weight of Sugar, sold for 7 pound, 12 shillings ready money,
there were gained 11 pound in the hundred, what did one pound cost at first
penny? First, di 7 pound, 6000000 by 111 pound, which is the principal and
interest given, and the quotient is 6 pound, 84684 fifthes, which 112 pound
cost ready money. Secondly, divide that quotient by 112 pound, makes 61132
sixths, or 14 pence, 3 farthings for the price that one pound cost at first
penny.

8. Example.

If 300 pieces of Lawne cost 321 pound, 4 shillings, how may I sell them to
loose 15 pound in the hundred? First, take the rate what one cost, by dividing
321 pound, 2 primes by 300, makes 1 pound, 0706666 seuenths, or 1 pound, 1
shilling, 5 pence almost for the price that one piece cost. Secondly, take the
interest of 10706666 seuenths at 15 pound in the 100, and subtract it, and then
makes 91006 sixths, or 18 shillings, 2 pence, 25 of a penny for the price to
sell one piece to lo^osse 15 pound in the 100 ready money. Thirdly, for the
proof of this work, say; If one piece cost 910067 sixths, what will 300 pieces
cost at that rate? Multiply 910067 sixths by 300, and cut off 6 figures to the
right hand, makes 273 pound, 5 pence almost for the sum received for 300 pieces
to loose 15 pound in the 100. Fourthly, for a second proof; take the interest
of 321 pound, 2 primes at 15 pound in the hundred loss, and deduct it from 321
pound, 2 primes, and there will remain 273 pound, 5 pence almost, which does
prove all the other works to be truly wrought.

9 Example.

If in one ell of Cloth sold for 3 shillings, 2 pence halfpenny, there were
gained 10 pound in the hundred ready money, what did that ell cost? Answer:
set 3 shillings 2 pence ob. in decimals, makes 38 pence, 5 primes; then divide
38 pence, 5000 fourths by 110 pound, makes 35 pence, the price that one ell
cost.

Example. ^

10. Example.

If in one ell of Cloth sold for 35 pence, 19 seconds, there were gained 7
pound in the hundred ready money, what did that ell cost, when there was 6
months time given? Divide 35 pound, 1900 fourths by half the interest, adding
one 100, which is 103 pence, 5 primes, and the quotient is 34 pence, the price
that the ell cost.

^

11. Example.

A Merchant lent money at 10 pound in the hundred for 100 pound profit for 12
months, and at the end of 6 months he received principal and interest 356
pound, the question is, what was the sum lent? Divide 356 pound, by 105
pound, which is the half years Interest and principal, and the quotient is
305 pound, 5105 of a pound for the sum lent.

Example. ^

12. Example.

If 17 pound loose 12 shillings, what will 100 pound loose? Divide 60000
fifthes by 17, makes 3 pound, 529 thirds, or 3 pound 10 shillings, 7 pence in
the hundred pound.

13. Example.

If 37 yards of velvet cost 32 pound, how must one yard be sold to gain 9
pound, 10 shillings in the hundred? First, 32 pound the price at 9 pound, 5
primes the hundred, makes 35 pound, 4 seconds; which divide by 37, makes the
price of one yard to be 94702 fifthes, or 18 shillings, 11 pence, ob. to sell
one yard to gain 9 pound, 10 shillings in the hundred.

2 Example.

If one pound exchange be 5 shillings, 6 pence what is 783 pound? Set 5 s. 6 d.
in Decimals, makes 275 thirds; which multiply by 783, makes 215 pound, 325
thirds, or 215 pound, 6 shillings, 6 pence; which added to the last example, is
1566 pound, and so much is the double of the sum given, viz. of 78^ pound,
because the two prices given, makes just 2 pound, and this by working a second
question in exchange, the first is proved to be truly wrought, as appears in
the example above.

3. Example.

If one pound exchange be 1 pound, 17 shillings, 7 pence, halfpenny, what is
1000 pound at that rate? Set 1 pound, 17 shillings, 7 pence, halfpenny in
Decimalls, makes 1 pound, 88125 fifthes; then because 1000 has; Ciphers, add
3 Ciphers, and cut off 5 figures, and the answer is 1881 pound, 5 shillings.

4 Example.

A Merchant does receive 134 pound, 6 shillings for the exchange of one hundred
pound sterling from Middleborough, what was one pound sterling in Flemmish
money? Place 134 pound, 6 shillings in Decimalls, is 134 pound, 3 primes; then
because 100 pound has 2 Ciphers, cut off two figures more to the left hand,
and it will be 1 pound, 343 thirds; or in Coin, 1 pound, 6 shillings, 11 pence,
farthing for the exchange of one pound at that rate.

5. Example.

A Merchant does receive 645 pound, 12 shillings for exchange money, at 1
pound, 7 shillings, 6 pence for one pound sterling, the question is, how much
sterling money he did deliver? Divide 645 pound, 6 primes by 1 li. 375 thirds,
or 1 pound, 7 shillings, 6 pence, makes 4695268 fourths, or 469 pounds, 10
shillings, 6 pence, 1 farthing for the sterling money delivered.

6 Example.

If 1 l. sterling be 1 l. 7 s. 6 d. Flemmish, what is 110 l. Flemmish in

Divide 146 pound, 744775 sixthes, by 1 pound, 3 shillings, 5 Pence, 3
farthings: which is 1 pound, 1739582 seuenths, and the quotient is 125 pound;
and so much must he deliver at London to receive 146 pound, 14 shillings, 10
pence, 3 farthings in Flemmish Coin at that rate.

Example. ^

9. Example.

A Merchant does deliver at Antwerpe 200 pound Flemmish by exchange for London
at 22 shillings, 10 pence Fleminish for one pound sterling, how much must he
receive at London? Answer: divide 200 pound by 1 pound, 141666 sixths, which
is 22 shillings, 10 pence; makes 175 pound.

A general Rule for exchange in Decimals.
If the price of a unite be given, then always divide the sum of money
whereon the question depends by that unite in decimalls, and the quotient is
the answer to the question.

1. Example.

A Merchant does deliver 100 pound sterling by exchange for Rome, at 72 pence
sterling for one Duckat De Camera; the question is, how many Ducats he must
receive at Rome for his 100 pound sterling? Here the price of one Ducket is
given to be 72 pence, which is 6 shillings, or 3 primes; wherefore I divide
100 pound by 3 primes, and the quotient is 333 pound, 13 of a pound, or 6
shillings, 8 pence for answer to the question.

2. Example.

A Merchant does deliver 756 pound sterling at London, to receive Ducats at 66
pence sterling, the price of one Dueket, the question is, how many Ducats he
must receive at Venice? Divide 756 pound by 66 pence, which is 275 thirds, and
the quotient is 2748 Ducats, and 3002750 of one Ducket for the Answer.

3. Example.

A Merchant at Venice does deliver 1000 Ducats, to receive at London 287
pound, 10 shillings sterling, what is one Ducket? Set down 287 pound, 5
primes, and divide by 1000 Ducats, makes at 5 shillings, 9 pence for one
Ducket.

^

Makes 5 s. 9. d. one Ducket^

4. Example.

A Merchant at Venice does deliver 800 Ducats by Exchange for London at 64
pence, b. the ducket sterling money, the question is, how much sterling he must
receive at London? Set out 64 pence, halfpenny in Decimals, makes 26875
fifthes; which multiply by 800, and cut off 5 figures because your fractions
are 5, and the product will be 215 pound sterling.

^

Makes 215 pound sterling.

5. Example.

A Merchant does deliver 1000 ducats by Exchange for London at 71 pence
sterling for one ducket, how much must he receive sterling money at London?
Set out 71 pence in decimalls, makes 2958 fourths, 13, and add 3 Ciphers for
10^0, and cut off 4 figures, makes 295 pound, 8 primes, 13, or 295 pound, 16
shillings, 8 pence for the answer.

^

Makes 295 l. 8 primes, 13

6. Example.

One penny Flemmish is 35 of one penny sterling, and one pound Flemmish is 35
of one pound sterling or ^2 shillings; wherefore to convert Flemmish money into
sterling Coin, multiply your Flemmish money by 35, which in decimals is 610, or
6, and the product will be the value of your Flemmish money in sterling Coin.
In 345 Flemmish, how much sterling Coin? Multiply 345 by 6 primes, and the
product is 207 pound sterling.

^

7. Example.

In 756 pound, 18 shillings sterling, how much Flemmish coin, when one penny
Flemmish is ^:5 of a penny English? Denide 756 pound, 9 primes by 6 primes,
makes 1201 pound, 5 primes, or 10 shillings.

Reduction of Measures from one place to another.
IF you will reduce the measure of one Country into the measures of another As
if you would reduce the measures of Antwerpe, Gaunt, Brudges, Civil, Roauen,
or of any other Country, into the measures at London; learn first the order
of measuring of all sorts of commodities in both places, either out of the
experience of Merchants and Tradesmen in those places, or out of the best and
latest approved Authors that have written Tables to that effect and note, that
4 else at London makes 5 yards, and 100 else at London is at

Else. Antwerpe 166^/^ Gaunt short measure 164 Gaunt long measure 154 Brudges
164 Arras 165 Calice 157 Lisse 166 Mastrich^ 173 Cullen 208 Franckfort 208
Nor^mberge 174 Da^tringe 139 Ro^^^ 103 Paris 95 Licons 100 Genna 480 ^/^
Palms. Millian 214 Braces. Florence 188 Braces. Venice for Silk has 196
Else. Venice for Linen has 180 Else. Rome 56 Cana. Lisb^^^^ 100 Varras.
Madera 104 Varras. Seuile 135 Varras.

These I have taken out of Mastersons Arithmatick.
The difference of one hundred Else, Palms, Varras, or Braces, being found of
any place from London; if you would convert the measures of any of those places
to London measure: as for example, If you would convert 356 else of Brudges
measure into else at London; you shall find in the Table, that 164 else make
100 at London; then by the Rule of Three say,

1. Example.

If 164 be 100, what are 356 else? Multiply 356 by 100 and divide by 164, makes
217 else, 12164 of an ell, which 356 at Brudges will make in London. But
according to the order of decimalls, if you will bring the measures of other
places to those of London? Set your number of one hundred found in the Table,
to a unite in decimalls, as in the last example 164 stands thus 164 seconds,
then you need but divide your number 356 by 1 pound, 64 seconds, and the
quotient is 217 else, 12 164 else, as in the last example.

Again, if you would reduce London measure to the measures of any other place?
Find the number of 100 to that place, and set it decimalls, and multiply your
number of else at London by those numbers found, and the product will be your
desire.

2. Example.

In 758 else at London, how many else at Dantzing, I find in the Table 139 else
there make 100 at London; so I set 139 to a unite, and it is 1 pound, 39
seconds; by which I multiply 758, makes 1053 else, 62100 parts.

^

3. Example.

If 166 else 73 at Antwerp be 100 else at London, how many else at London are
1756 else at Antwerpe? Set 166, 23 to a unite, makes 1 pound, 66 seconds, and
23 of a second: Or otherwise; 1 ell, and 23 of one ell, by which divide 1756,
makes 1053, 12

^

4. Example.

In 3258 else at London, how many Braces at Millian? Find 214 for 100 at London
so that if you set 214 to a unite, it will be 2 pound, 14 seconds; by which
multiply 3258, makes 6982 Braces, and 12100 parts of a Brace.

And in this manner you may eass^y convert your Measures or Waights from one
place to another, either by Multiplication or Division, without the Golden
Rule: but of this, if it please God to lend me life and health, I do purpose
to speak in a Treatise at large of Decimall Arithmatick for the good of my
Countrymen and others, if I find these my labors and endeavors to be
acceptable and beneficial to others, and will better inform my self by
Merchants, who have had experience in the Reduction of Waights and Measures
from place to place; in the mean time here is a foundation laid to work upon;
let the difference be what it will, and so for this time I will end this
Treatise of Decimall Arithmatick, and go in hand with some operations of
Annuities, as follows.

Of Interest and Annuities.
How to frame Tables to work Interest and Annuities, or Purchases at any rate.
FOrasmuch as these kind of operations of interest and Annuities are ^^ry
tedious and trouble some, if they be to be wrought for many years, althougb I
have already in the former Book set forth many several manners of working
those kind of questions after a more easy kind of method, then heretofore has
been published by any other in the like kind whatsoever yet here I have thought
good also in this place to show the ways, whereby any man that is desirous to
be satisfied in the reasons or grounds of those kind of works, may be able to
calculate for his own use a Table or Tables, whereby to abreuiate those kind
of operations by Multiplication, or Division, only without the help of the
Golden Rule, or any tedious Reductions of Multiplications and Divisions for
many years to come at one only operation, as shall appear by the examples
following.

How to calculate the Table or Breuiat of 10 pound in the hundred Compound
Interest.
If you will calculate a table for 10 pound in the hundred compound Interest
for 21 or 30 years? Place your numbers, as in the examples following,
beginning with a unite, or ^, adding 7 Ciphers unto it, and then take the tenth
part of that, which is the same numbers one room more to the right hand, and
add them into the first numbers, and the total will be the sum for* the
first year, and so you must work for the second, third, fourth, etc. until
21, or 30 years: but here you shall note, that you shall not need to set
down in your Breuiate more then 8, 9, or 10 numbers at the most, for because
the rest will be superfluous, as for example.

Example. Int. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8 Year. Int. 1. 2. 3. 4 5. 6. 7. 8 Year. 1

Here you may sec in this Table the manner of gathering the Breuiate of 10
pound in the hundred, Compound interest, which you may extend to what number of
years you please, only adding a unite in the eight place, as you see the
figures in the ninth place do arise, and now I will here set down the
Breuiate from one year unto 40 ready gathered.

How to calculate a Table or Breuiate at any rate under or above 10 pound in
the hundred, Compound Interest.
If you would calculate a Table or Breuiat any rate under or above 10 pound in
the hundred compound interest, place a unite with seven Cypheres to it; then if
you will calculate for 12 pound in the hundred or 16 pound; set your 12, or 16
under the 2 first Ciphers next the unite, and multiply your unite, omitting
the ciphers by your interest, and add the product into one total, and the
sum is the principal and interest for the first year, and so work again
for the second, third, etc. to finish your Table, as aforesaid, at 10 pound in
the hundred* But if your interest be under 10 pound in the hundred, place your
number of the interest under the second Cipher from your unite, and work as is
in the example following.

Example. Int. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5 6. 7. 8 Years Int. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5 6. 7 8 Years 1
00000000 1 86048896 4 80 8 1 08000000 1 10883904 8 ^ 864 1 46932800 5 8 1

36048896 4

In this manner you may proceed infinitely: and thus much shall suffice for
making of these Breuiats.

In this sort you may gather all the Tables or Breuiats for any rate in the
hundred, which I will here omit in this small vollum, intending afterward to
publish this, and diverse other operations in my second Edition of my Book of
Decimall Arithmatick shortly to come forth.

The use of these Breuiates and Tables, and of all others of like nature in
working of questions of Interest and Annusties.
Rule 1.
To find what 1 pound due at any number of years is worth at the end of the
term? Enter the Table of 10 pound in the hundred, and find in the left Ma^gent
the number of years, and from that number so found, cut off seven figures, the
answer is in pounds, primes, seconds, thirds, fourths, etc. for the answer to
the question demanded.

1. Example.

What is one pound put forth at interest compound, at 10 pound in the hundred
worth, to be paid at the end of 18 years? Find the eighteenth number in the
Breuiat, which is 55599173; from which cut off seven figures to the right hand,
and the answer is 5 pound, 11 shillings, 2 pence, q.

Example. ^

Makes 5 l. 11 s. 2 d. 1q.

2. Example.

What is 100 pound due at 7 years end worth to be paid at the end of the
term, at 10 in the hundred compound Interest? Find the seventh number in the
Table of 10 l. in the hundred, makes 19487171; to the which add two Ciphers,
because 100 pound has two Ciphers, and cut off seven figures to the right
hand, and the sum is 194 pound, 87171 fifthes for the Answer.

^

3 Example.

What will 758 pound for 6 year make at 10 pound in the hundred compound
Interest, to be paid* at the end of the term? Find the sixth number in the
Table of 10 pound in the hundred, which is 17715610; which multiply by 758, the
money named in the question, and the product, cutting off 7 figures to the
right hand, makes 1342 pound, 16 shillings, 10 pence, ob. almost.

^

Rule 2.
How to find what any yearly Annuitie will make to be paid all at the end of
the term? First, find the number of years of the annuitie given, and from the
number answering, deduct a unite in the first place to the left hand, and add
a Cipher to the last figure to the right hand, and cut off seven figures to the
right hand, and the answer is found.

1. Example.

What will 1 pound annuitie make, to be paid for at the end of the term of 16
years at 10 pound in the hundred compound interest? Find the sixteenth number
in the Table of 10 pound in the hundred, and subtract a unite from the first
figure to the left hand, adding a Cipher to the right hand, makes 359497290;
From the which cut off 7 figures to the right hand, makes 35 pound, 18
shillings, 11 pence, 3 farthings.

^

2. Example.

What will 1000 pound annuitie yearly amounts unto to be all forborne until
the end of the term of 5 years at 10 pound in the hundred compound interest?
Find the fifth number in the Table of 10 pound in the hundred, and subtract a
unite from the first figure, adding a Cipher in the last place, makes 61051000:
then because 1000 pound has 3 Ciphers, add 3 Ciphers, and cut off seven
figures, makes 6105 pound, 2 shillings for the answer.

^

3. Example.

What will 142 pound annuitie make to be paid at the end of the term of 10
years? Find the tenth number in the Breuiat of 10 pound in the hundred, and
subtract a unite in the first place, adding a Cipher to the last, makes
159374240; which multiply by 142 pound, the annuitie named, and from the
product cut off seven figures to the right hand, and the answer to the
question is 2263 pound, 2 shillings, 2 pence, 3 farthings.

^

3. Rule.
How to find what any sum of money due at the end of any number of years is
worth in ready money, at 10 pound in the hundred compound interest. Enter the
Table of 10 pound in the hundred with your number of years, and the numbers
which does answer in the Table is your Divisor; then add seven Ciphers to
your sum of money given, to make your dividend; then divide your dividend by
your Divisor, and the quotient, adding more Ciphers, will be your answer in
pounds, primes, seconds, thirds, etc.

1. Example.

What is 1000 pound due at 7 years end worth in ready money, at 10 pound in
the hundred compound interest? Find the seventh number in the Table of 10 pound
in the hundred, which is 19487171, this is your Divisor. Then add seven
Ciphers to 1000 pound, makes 1000000000; or add more Ciphers, marking out your
prime line in your dividend, to find out how many figures your quotient will
have in whole numbers, and the rest will be primes, seconds and thirds; this
is your dividend, and then divide by your divisor, makes 513 pound, 3
shillings, 2 pence.

^

Having found what 1000 pound due at 7 years end is worth in ready money, if
you will find what 100 pound, or 10 pound, or 1 pound is worth in ready money;
place your quotient in decimalls, and mark out your prime lines, cutting of
one figure for 100 pound, ^ for 10 pound, or 3 for 1 pound, the answer is as
follows.

Example. ^

2. Example.

What is 750 pound due at 5 years end worth in ready money, at 10 pound in the
hundred compound interest? Find the fifth number in the Table of 10 pound in
the hundred, which is 16105100 for divisor; then place 10 Ciphers before your
number given 750 pound, and mark out your prime line, and divide by your
Divisor, and the quotient will be 465 pound, 13 shillings 10 pence for the
answer to the question given.

Example. ^

Makes 465 pound, 13 shillings, 10 pence.

3. Example.

What is 847 pound due at 21 years end worth in ready money, at 10 pound in
the hundred compound interest? Find the 21 number in the Table of 10 pound in
the hundred for Divisor, which is 74002499; then set 10 Ciphers to your numbers
given, makes 8470000000000 for your diuedend; then divide, and the quotient
will be 144 l. 9 s. 1 d. 15 of 1 d. the answer.

Example. ^

Makes 114 l. 9 s. 1 d. 15 of a penny.

4 Rule.
How to find what any yearly Annuities for any number of years is worth in
ready money at 10 pound in the hundred compound interest. Enter the Table of 10
l. per cent* with your number of years given, and from the numbers found
subtract a unite in the first place and place a Cipher in the last for your
dividend; which divide by the number found in the Table against your years
given, and the quotient is the answer to the question.

1. Example.

What is 100 pound per annum annuitie for 21 years worth in ready money at 10
pound in the hundred Compound ^nterest? Look in the Table of 10 pound in the
hundred for 2^ years, and subtract a unite in the first place, and add a
Cipher in the last, makes 6400; 4990; Divide this by 74002499, the 21 number,
adding Ciphers, and marking the prime line, and the quotient is 864 pound, 17
shillings, 4 pence, ^ farthings for the answer to the question demanded.

Example. ^

2. Example.

Having found what 100 pound annuitie will amount unto, if you would know what
10 pound* or 1 pound annuitie will amount unto, or 1000 pound in 21 years;
place it in Decimalls, and cut off 1, 2, or add 3 Ciphers to the last, or
remove 3 places, and you shall find your demand.

Example. ^

3. Example.

What is 546 pound yearly annuitie for 14 years worth in ready money, at
ten pound in the hundred compound interest?

Find the fourteenth number in the Breuiate of 10 pound in the hundred; from it
subtract a Unite in the first place, and add a Cipher, makes 279749830; which
multiply by 546, makes 152743407180* which divide by 37974983, the 14 number in
the Breuiate, makes 4022 pound, 4 shillings, 2 pence, 3 farthings.

^

Makes 4022 l. 4 s. 2 d. 34

1. Example.

There is a Debt bought for 513 pound, 3 shillings, 2 pence ready money, which
was due at 7 years end, now the question is, what the debt was at 10 pound in
the hundred compound interest? Set your money paid in Decimalls, makes 513158;
which multiply by 19487171, the number against 7 years, cutting off 10
figures, makes 999 pound, 999 thirds, wanting but one third of 1000 pound;
wherefore I conclude, the debt was 1000 pound, which was due at 7 years end.

2 Example.

There was a Debt bought for 600 pound, which was due at 4 years end, what was
that debt at 10 pound in the hundred compound interest? Multiply 600 pound by
the numbers against 4 years, which are 14641000 makes 878 pound, 4600000
seuenths, or in Coin 878 pound, 9 shillings, 2 pence, 25 of 1 penny for the
sum of that debt.

^

Makes 878 l. 9 s. 2 d. 25 of a penny.

I have set no exampies of the Table of 8 pound in the hundred, nor of no other
rate, bectuse I intend shortly to speak more at large of this subject in
another volume, if God please to give me time and health, in which I intend to
speak more at large of the Grounds, Reasons and proofs of these kind of
Operations, and here I will finish this small Treatice of the second Book.
