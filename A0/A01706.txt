The preface.
WHo list to look about
May i^ Cronicles soon fi^de out
what seeds the Popysshe route
In England has sown
Because the time is short
I shall bryuely report,
And write in dew sort
Therein what I have known.
King Herolde.
IN the time of Herolde the King
Robert of canterbury had his banyshinge
Ye may be sure for no good living
That ever man hard say
To Wyllyam Conqueror the bishop went
To whom Alexander a banner sent
Of clean remyssion their wicked intent
Was England to dekaye.
William conqueror.
THe abbeys of England great and stout
This king caused to be serched out
The money there found all round about
Was brought to the kings treasure
The bishop of canterbury with many mo
And diverse abbottes were depryued also
And were made quo^dams ye may well know
For no good demenure.
William the second.
WIth william ye.ii. what strife did make
Bishop Ancelme and how stout a crake
Made Rafe of chechester for the trybutes sake
For women that priests did pay
This king in posession had certain
The byshoprycke of canterbury and did retain
Wynton and Sarum in his full main
Till the hour of his death.
The abbays he sold or to farm did let
The styffe necked prelates he under kept
And with their popery he ever met
So long as he had brethe.
Henry the first.
ALrelme also did likewise crake
With Henry the first and out did shake
Much disobediens, and would not forsake
To withstand the kings will.
Stephyn.
By a false oath lightly taken
Of wyllm^ of canterbury stephen was not forsaken
King of England, but shortly shaken
Or his mind he could fulfill.
Henry the second.
THat poison prelate Thomas becked
A saint by name, but with treason decked
And with popery all to specked
To his later end,
Proud and stoberne in all assayes
with ye never, but ever with nayes
His prince to withstand thus he always
His mind did fully bend.
Richard the first.
TO the holy land archbishop baldwyne
Of canterbury went full fine
The king tarried not long behyne
But thither also went
And not without the pryuie council
Of the bishops if I dare it tell
That they might rule and bear the bell
Was their full intent,
Tharche bishop of york alas alas
Was the kings brother who endly did pas
His life of bishops as the manner was
Now it is not so.
All the chaleses given were
To ransom the king being prisonere
With Themperoure more than a year
Fro thens or he might go.
King John^.
WHat mysery also a long time was
In king John^ time, by that wicked as
Stephen Leigton of Canterbury alas, alas
That ever he was borne.
Henry the third.
IN the first year of this king
The said Stephen did in bring
The Legate Pandulphe with his blessyng
The king an oath to take
which was their church for to defend
But such rebellions against him did bend
That ever after to his lyfes end
Peace he could not make.
Edward the first.
THe bishop of saint Andrews i^ scotland
with ye bishop of basto^ made a great ba^d
Of diverse lords and took in hand
Against this king to fight
As perjured rebels the bishops were sent
By the king to the fyfte Innocent
The lords were heddyd and in peaces rent
As traitors should be dyght.
Edward the second.
Such strife and rebellione
Had Edward the secone
With his lords each one
Till his latter day
That if his prelacy
With their privy popery
Had not stand thereby
His lords had made no fray.
Edward the third.
IN this kings time the.vi. Innocent
Gave in England benefyce and prebe^t
Until this king sent contrary co^mau^dme^t
To his bishops all
This king forbadde that Peter pens
Should to Rome be gathered from hens
His mind was and whole pretens
To govern great and small.
Richard the second.
A Ru^dell of canterbury in this kings time
And the earl of darby for no small crime
Banyshed were who after did clyme
And the king was over thrown.
Henry the fourth.
THen was the Earl crowned king
Henry the.iiii. this is no lesynge
Of whom the bishops had the rulynge
After their own mind.
Henry the fyfte.
HEnry the fyfte they did not let go
Out of their ruli^ge, they well did know
That if they did a mortuall fo
No doubt they should him find
This king went about to take away
Their temporalties, but night and day
His mind to turn they did assaye
With money to conquer france
So in to france the king did go
Where in short time he subdued so
Towns and Castelles he did over through
To France a bitter chance.
Henry the.vi.
IN Henrys days the.vi. this is no nay
The good duke of glocet was cast away
By the bishop of wynchester yt prelate gaye
In strife dysdayne and pride
A cardynall this prelate was made
Who shortly after to France yade
Between both kings a peace to be had
And there he did abide
With the romyshe legate to have his fill
Of the popyshe power was all his will
But of peace he made no skyll
And that did well appear
For ever after to England fell
Much misery, the devil of hell
Reward such prelates that so does sell
The truth both far and nere.
Edward the.iiii.
THis king would had gotten france again
But the prelates the rat did sore disdayn
And from that purpose did him refrain
Which caused bate and strife
Who list the Cronicles for to read
Shallse to death how many did blede
And how the prelates helped at need
With swerdespere or knyfe.
Richard the third.
THis kings time was so short
That with him to have their sport
The Popyshe prelates had no comfort
So feable was thyr might.
Henry the.vii.
THe Deane of Paul's with ye provincial
Of the black friars and other great and small
And ye Pryor of Langley by treason did fall
For lack of godly sight
The Cardynall Morton and fox of wynchester
By their subtyle council consydred together
Caused Bolen to beseged with fire and spear
And many was there stroyed.
Henry the.viij.
LIke cautell used Cardynall Wolsey
By causyng the scotts to run and fly
To the English pale but them quickeley
The Norden men anoyed
And what craftye pra^kes ye prelates did play
To turn the kings mind cleue away
When on the petycottes he would the^ pay
According to their deserte.
Much thereof I need not write
Their Popyshe Iuggelynge is in sight
And how against the stream they fight
Which causes them to smerte
In this kings time ye do well know
How great an enmye and mortal fo
The Popyshe prelates has been also
Against Gods word so pure
For which words only sake
Many an heart full often to quake
Right piteously they did make
And for that thing I you ensure
To the which with leg, foot, and toe
They cease not a pace now to go
Full mekely crouchyng and full low
Gladly agreyng there to
As the king in earth supreme
Head of the Church of this realm
Only to be our Joyful beam
We must obey and know
And all such that in authority
His grace has assigned to be
We must obey in each degree
Orelles we get damnacion
Unto our selfs, this is no ly
The power is gods mynyster to us truly
If we do evil he reuengeth freely
And all for our salvation
The pardons also for purgatory
With the detestable sin of buggary
And all kind of Idolatry
Gods word has put to flight
And much popery I tell you plain
That ranckely did privily reign
As now is known abroad certain
Gods word has brought to light
Many things mo were hydden
And by the papystes over strydden
Which abroad be now spredden
Daily before your eye,
whereat some whyne full sore
But spesially that their popyshe lore
whom they had so long in store
Away now do fly
Had not the poor sely soulles
So often brought forth to powlles
Spread abroad the popyshe rolls
Of their old fassyon
The shameless popyshe clargye
would still have been hardye
And nothing at all tardye
In their habomynacyon
This is no lie that I you tell
Full cruel were they and full fell
Against them that of the Gospel did smell
And forsook their fusty popery
They know now ye law they know ye pain
They can no longer clock nor feign
And if they do I tell you certain
Their reward is plain ropery
Hereof I need not much to say
Many assayde the game and knew ye play
It were best they turn their mind away
And strife not against the right
If their lordly power might ones abate
Then would they quyckely open the gate
Of true doctrine which of late
King Harry has brought to light
God save king Edwardes noble grace
And send his hyghnes time and space
To contynewe forth his fathers trace
With force strenght and might
And send evil chance and crooked happes
To all such Popyshe forked cappes
That gave so many cursed flappes
For Gods blessed word
So has he done it is certain
They have not wone I tell you plain
And never shall till they have again
The Pope to be their Lord.
God for bydde.
Thus ends this breue Cronycle.
