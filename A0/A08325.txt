AN APPENDIX TO THE ANTIDOTE.

CONTAINING A Catalogue of the visible and perpetual Succession of the
Catholic Professors of the Roman Church, by whom the doctrine now taught
under Pope Gregory the XV. has been in all Ages, and Countries, since
Christ, constantly and uniformly maintained.

TOGETHER WITH A Counter-Catalogue discovering the interruption of Heretical
Sects, amongst whom the chief Protestant Articles, and their Authors, have
been in diverse Ages, upon sundry occasions, contradicted, and condemned, by
the Watchmen of the true Church.

AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER, Concerning the two Catalogues ensuing.
FOR as much as the visible succession of lawful Pastors, and the perpetual
pedigre of zealous belieuers, is an infallible mark of Christ's chosen Spouse;
I have here (Gentle Reader) presented to thy view: First, the supreme Heads
and Governors of the Roman Church. Secondly, the chief Professors by which
it has still continued, and such as for the most part in all ages have been
generally known, or publicly canonized Saints. Thirdly, diverse substa^tiall
points of our Catholic Faith, which they most constantly taught and believed:
I quote the places only, but seldom relate their words, because I have cited
them at large, for the first five hundred years in the Controversies
themselves. Fourthly, the General Councels lawfully called, and assembled by
them. Fifthly, the Conuersions of Countries, which they have performed by
authority and commission from Christ his Vicar on earth. Sixthly, sundry
authentical and approved miracles by which God himself vouchsafed to testify
either the sanctity of the men, or verity of their doctrines: for as with
miracles the Church was first planted by Christ, as with miracles it was after
spread and propagated by the Apostles, who going forth preached every where
Marc. 10. 20.
our Lord, working with all, and confirming the word with signs that followed:
So with the glory of miracles it has still flourished according to our Savior
his Joan. 14. 12.
Prediction: He that belieueth in me, the works that I do he also shall do;
and greater then these he shall do. Likewise, These signs shall follow such
as believe: in Mar. 16.
my name they shall cast out Devils etc. For this cause Tertul. in lib. de
Praescript. Epiphan. l. 2. de hares haer. 30.
Tertullian challenges the Heretics of his time, to produce their miracles,
as we do now our modern Sectaries. Epiphanius conuinceth Ebion of false
belief, because neither he, nor any one of his faction had the gift of working
miracles, speaking thus unto him. Raise thou, O Ebion, some dead man, cleanse
the leprous, restore sight to the blind, or heal a man sick of the palsy if
thou can; but thou can not, because through incredulity thou docst the
contrary, clogged with the chains of flesh: but if thou can not perform
these things, as indeed thou can not by means of thy naughty faith, yea if
thou invoke the name of Christ, thou shall no way prevail etc. And S.
Ambrose Ambros. tom. 3. ser. 91. de invent. corp. SS Gerua. and Protas.
discardeth the Arrians from being of the same belief with the glorious
martirs of Christ, for not acknowledging the famous miracles wrought by their
merits, which the very devils confessed. S. Augustine among other marks, by the
fame of miracles, was held in the bosom of the Church: and says of them.
August. cont. epist. Manich. c. 4.
Now also at this present miracles are wrought in Christ's name, what by his
sacraments what by the prayers or memories of Saints. And the^ rebuking the
infidelity of our adversaries, They believe not (quoth he) these lat^r, which
also do not believe that our Lord Jesus was Aug. l. 22. de ciuit. c. 8. ibid
cap. 8. 9. 10.
borne of his mother without impayring her virginity, and that he entered in to
his disciples the doors being shut. Hitherto S. Augustine.

On the other side I have also set down the dismembered row, or scattered
ranks of such heretical Innouatours, as from Christ his days even until
ours, have newly sprung up, and vented forth their strange devises; which
according to the property of lies and falsities, have been never the same: but
diverse, monstrous, and allwaies changeable, co^curring in nothing but in maine
oppositio^ to the Roman Church, and her professors, she still remaining
inviolable, and constant without any addition, change, or alteration of her
first received Faith; the special note, by which Thcodorct discerns verity
from falsehood, saying: (...), that is in English: Alcasing is diverse and
various, but one or single Theod. orat. 1. d^ ^ro^id.
is the beauty of truth. How beit I do not specify all their infamous
blasphemies: but only such as beer and there are licked up by the Protestants
of our time.

Then I show how the Pastors of the true Church have particulerly checked and
repressed them: by which, my dear Countrymen may see that the brave show, or
whole band of their new assertions, is nothing else but a fresh muster of old
accursed heresies; that the predecessors and foreru^ners, of whom they vaunt,
were Rebels to the Church, Enemies to God, and blasphemers of his holy name.
Yet because want of others forces our Ghospellers, to entaile their profession
upon them, I declare briefly how they embraced some gross errors, or
fundamental articles of Catholic religion impugned by Protestants, both
which cut them off from their confederacy. Neither is their claim of any force
to link the^ with Christ, set case they had not varied in opinions: for the
faithful of his flock must be a known generation of Pastors and People,
Parents and Children, Heads and Members, successively propagated, and jointly
united without interruption one from the other: they must still persevere
constant and impregnable, what opposition soever be made against them. But
these heretics started up at diverse times, in diverse countries, here one,
there another, without head, without parentage, without knowledge, dependence,
or communication among themselves, have often retracted, often changed their
hideous fancies, were all conquered, subdued, and put to silence by the Roman
Church; and therefore could not be that happy seed which our Lord has blessed,
but base and unkind slipps, grafted by Satan; of whom the Sap 4. verse. 3. 4.
Wiseman says: Bastard plants shall not take deep root, nor lay sure
foundation. And if in the boughs for a time they shall spring being weakly
set, they shall be moved of the wind; and by the vehemence of the winds, they
shall be rooted out.

Protestants now calumniate the miracles achieved by holy men, and merits of
Saints.

C. Simo^ Magus also taught, that God is the author of sin. Vin. Lirin. adu.
pro. haeret. nouitat. cap. 34. The same is auerred by Calu. l. 2. institut. c.
17. l. 2. cap. 4. l. 3. c. 23. and by Fulke with other English Sectaryes, who
although they would free themselves from this hellish blasphemy: yet as long as
they teach, that God wills sin, that his will necessitates ours, that he
creates some purposely to damnation, predetermineth the end, and works the
cause of their destruction, they cannot be free, as is proved in the 29.

D. Likewise he held that man wants the liberty of free will. Clem. Roman.

l. 1. c. 20. which are two fundamental points of our new Ghospellers
profession, and stiffly maintained by Whitaker, Abbot, and others, as I have
showed Contro. 12. 13. and 21. Their other dotages I omit, and all the infamous
heresies of the rest of their fellow-sectaries, whose names are ranged in the
first Colu^ne of this second page because I only endeavor to relate such as
are newly set abroach and defended by our Protestants.

A. BY our Savior Christ Jesus. Joan. 6. 54. 55. 56. etc. Matt. 26. 26. Marc.
14. Luc. 22. 1. Cor. 11. 24.

B. By Christ our Savior. Luc. 11. 20. If I in the singer of God, do cast out
Devils, surely the kingdom of God is come upon you. By S. Luke, who recou^teth
as true and vnfaygned miracles, how S. John, and S. Peter healed a lame man.
Act. 3. 6. how S. Peter healed Tabitha. Act. 9. 41. how s. Paul restored a dead
child to life. Act. 20. 10. how the only shadow of the one, and handkercheife

free, opposite to necessity. Sa^nt Joan. c. 1. 12. Apoc. 3. 20. S. Matt. 16.

testifies de fide and operibus c. 14. lib. de vni. bapt. c. 10. Clem. Romans in
constitut. Apost. l. 6. c. 19. S. Martial. epist. ad Tol^sa. The Centurists for
this cause reject the epistls of S. James and S. Jude. cent. 1. l. 2. c. 4.
col. 54. and they affirm of s. James epistle, that it swarueth not a little
from the analogy of Apostolical doctrine, whiles it ascribes Justification not
to faith alone, but also to works. And yet S. Augu. thought it Apostolical,
and written of purpose to condemn the contrary opinion of Justification by
faith alone. S. Augustine in the place before cyted.



The second Century from the year 100. unto the 200.
The chief heads of the Church, and her general Counsels. Her Professors,
and Conuersions made by them. Her Doctrine, and Miracles. Heretics without a

Blastus Proclus. Berillus. Florinus. Praxeas etc.
AMONGST the tares of this age some unsavory weeds of Protestancy have shooted
up. For

F. The Gnostikes held extrinseall justice by imputatio^ only. Iren. l. 1. c. 5.

G. The Valentinians attributed sin not to freewill, but either to the nature
of the world, or to the Devil. Aug. haer. 11. Castro. V. peccat. hae. 3.
Neither do Protestants ascribe it to our freedom, but either to natural
corruption, by which man's will (says Fulke) is capti^e and thrall to sin.
Fulke in cap. 5. ad Galat. sect. 1. and in cap. 10. ad Romans sect. 6. or which
is worse, to the immutable decree and ordinance of God. (Calu. l. 3. inst. c.
23. sect. 4. 7. 8. 9.) according to him imposing necessity.

H. The Valentinians, with the Montainsts contemned unwritten traditions, and
appealed, as Protestants do, to Scripture alone. Tertull. l. de praesc. Hist.
Eccle. l. 5. c. 16. l. 3. c. 36.

I. Proclus taught, which protestants now take hold of, that sin abides in the
regenerate, and that it cannot be rooted out as long as the body lives.
Epipha. haer. 64. yet he affirmed, as they also do, contrahi, and sopiri
peccatu^, sin to be restrained, cast asleep, assuaged or curbed of its
reign. Epipha. ibid. which are the very phrases of our new Ghospellers
concerning this point. See Field and Abbots words Contro. 18.

K. Florinus renewed the former heresy of making God the author of sin.
Eusebius. l. 5. c. 25. Notwithstanding our Adversaries, I think, will be ashamd
to make these or any of the forenamed Arch-heretikes the corner sto^es or first
foundations of their Religion, by reason of other most execrable heresies which
they obstinately maintained. And yet one fundamental error, as all learned
Protestants confess, excludes from the Church.

F. BY Irenaeus in in the same place, and l. 3. c. 20. by Justin. in dialog.
cum Triphone.

G. Justin ad quaest. 103. proves that me^ sin by election, choice and
liberty of freewill; not by nature, because some are defiled with one vice,
some with another, some with more, some with less: which could not be, says
he, s^ naturae imbecillitate, non volumatis consilij praetermissionehomines
peccare^t.

H. Iren. l. 3. c. 2. by Tert. l. de praesc. where both provoke heretics to
the inviolable tradition of the Roman Church: and Tertul. avouches, that, the
most expert in Scripture, will little prevail against Heretics, with
Scripture alone. Likewise in this age the two false Prophets Barchabas and
Barochop, which Basilides alleged to countenance his impiety, were rejected by
tradition: neither could our Protestants ever disprove them (as Canus well
notes) by the text of Scripture. Canus. l. 2. de loc. Theol. c. 7. And Clemens
Alexa^drinus scholar to Pantenus, and master to Origin writes, l. 2. strom.
that some who denied traditions, renounced also the Epistles of S. Paul to
Timothy, because by these words Depositum custodi, 1. ad Tim. c. 6. they were
convinced.

I. By Gaius an eloque^t writer, of whom Eusebius. l. 6. c. 14. By Justin. Apol.
ad Anto. and S. Cypr. who flourished immediately after, proves at large. lib.
3. ad Quir. sect. 65. Omnia peccata in baptismo deponi: All sins to be
abolished by baptism. The same is affirmed by Orige^. tract. 35. in Math. hom.
15. in Iosu. hom. 14. in c. 2. Luc.

K. Irenaens wrote a book that God is not the Author of sin, of which
Eusebius makes mention. l. 5. c. 19.



The third Century from the year 200. unto the 300.
The chief heads of the Church, and her general Counsels. Her Professors,
and Conuersions made by them. Her Doctrine, and Miracles. Heretics without a

Many Gentiles converted by the apparitions of S. Potamiana the Martyr, from
heaven; among which the most memorable was, that of Basilides, on whose head
she placed a crown, and obtained of God pardon for him, as she promised him,
when he lead her to her Martyrdom. Eusebius. Caesa. l. 6. cap. 4.

The Prince of Arabia his Court, by Origin. Genebr. in Pontiano and Pet. Dami.

Confut. of Purg. page 362.) Tertullian, Cyprian, Augustine, Hierome, and a great
many more do wi^nesse that Sacrifice for the dead is the tradition of the
Apostles, Singlelife. Minut. Faelix in Oct. Cypr. de discip. and habit. virg.

because it ends at Easter.

Miracles. Diverse were wrought in this age, by Greg. Thaumat. which S. Gregory
Nissen in vita Greg. Thaum. and S. Basil de sp. sanct. c. 29. record. Some he
wrought by the sign of the Cross: many otherways, in so much as he was
termed another Moses, says S. Basil loc. cit. even by the enemies of truth.
S. Cyprian among other, writes Ser. de lap. of 3. strange miracles concerning
the Eucharist, plainly co^firming the truth of the real presence therein.

Likewise S. Cecily showed to Valeria^ the Angel-gardian of her virginity,

haer. 32. Epiphan. hae. 30. and 53. from whom some Protestant Politicia^s
little differ, who think it lawful to frequent heretical Conuenticles, and to
dissemble in divine service, for saving their goods, or obeing their Prince.

Image of God. Epipha. hae. 64. and ep. ad loa^. Epis. Hierosol. which is now
the express fancy of Calvin. l. 2. Instit. c. 1. sect. 5. and a consequence
which follows out of Whites (in the way to the true Church. sect. 40. fol.

al such natural faculties, as should cooperate to Gods callings, making them
work no more therein, then paper does to the receiving of ink.,

N. Nouatia^ or Nouatus (as the Grecians call him) maintained theabsolutio^ of
Priests not to be auailable to the lapsed. Socrat. l. 4. c. 23. and his

which we now use, of imposition of hands.

Professors of the Roman Church. General Counsels. The first Nicen Council
having in it 318. Fathers under Pope Siluester, against Arrius, who denied the
co^substantiality of the Son of God with his Father. The first
Constantinopolita^ Council having in it 150. Fathers, under Damasus Pope,

The fifth Century from the year 400. unto the 500.
The chief heads of the Church, and her general Counsels. Her Professors,

head. Their Heresies revived by Protestants. Contradicted and condemned by the
Professors of the Roman Church. The Ephesin Council, having in it 200.
Fathers, under Celestine Pope, against Nestorius the Heretic. The Calcedon
Council having in it 630. Fathers, under Pope Leo the great, against Eutiches
the Heretik.
EXVPERYVS, Hieronymus, Euthymius, Nicasius, Augustinus the Doctor, a great
pillar of the Church and propugnator of our Catholic faith, as you may read in
the book entitled Confessio Augustiniana, (set forth by Torrensis) Paulinus,
Sulpitius Seuerus, Paulus Orosius, Hesychius, Symeon Stelyta, Germanus,
Patricius, Melania and her husband Pepinian, who with mutual consent, vowed
Chastity, and going from Rome to Jerusalem, the one e^tred into a Monastery of

Ephesus, gave him a pall, which there he wore, and in celebrating the holy
mysteries. Celest. ep. 3. Theod. Bals. in Nemoc. After that S. Cyrill with the
Council had condemned the heresy of Nestorius, devotion much increased to the
mother of God: Pulcheria raised a temple in her honor: and this addition is
then thought to have been joined to the Angelical salutation, Holy Mary mother
of God, pray for us sinners, etc. Baron. an. 431. n. 176. and 180. possidonius,

O. The Predestinate were so named, because they attributed all things, even

P. Zenaias, says Nicephorus. l. 16. c. 27. was the first (O arrogant mind and
impudent mouth) who belched forth this saying, that the images of Christ, and
those that most pleased him, are not to be worshipped. And Functius a
Protestant writer says: Zenaias was the first in the Church who waged war
against images. Comment. l. 7. Are not our Sectaris guilty of all these
blasphemies? For with Vigilantius, Zenaias and the Predestinate they wholly
accord in the aforsaid assertio^s: with the Pelagians, though not in the
grounds of their denials, yet in the things denied by the^, which the Fathers
impugned: with Iouinian and Petilian, in the same sort as I have noted: yet
they disse^ted from them all in many other substantial points.

Q. SEVERUS was either author or rather fauorer of the Heretics called Acephali
(Prateolus V. Seuerus. Baron. an. 511.) who deserved that name because they
wanted a head, wanted true and lawful Bishops, lineally descending from the
Apostles, from whom they might receive their faith and sacracramentes. In which
sense our Protestants also are Acephali, because they have no supreme head, no
such consecrated Priests, or Bishops as truly derive their succession from
Christ and his Apostles.

R. Petrus Apamensis hatinge the Saints of the Roman Religion, scraped their
names out of the tabls of the Church. Baro. anno 518. number. 46.

S. Their images also he plucked down and defaced: yet he honored the images
of Dioscorus, and his heretical accomplices, as our Sectaryes now a days.
Baron. ibid.

T. Religious houses, Nunneries and Monasteryes he profaned. Baro. ibid. nu.

V. The Agnoitae imputed ignorance to Christ (Damase. l. de haer. Prateol. V
Agnoitae) affirming the last day to be unknown to him; because it is said,
That day or hour no man knows, neither the Angels in heaven, nor the Son,
but the Father. Mar. 13. v. 32. upon which words Calvin groundeth the same
heresy. Harmo. in Mat. 24. v. 36. and in Mar. 13. v. 32. and more impudent then
the Agnoitae, he labors to refell the ancient Fathers, for teaching the
contrary.

X. The Iacobites denied the necessity of Auriculer confession to Priests, and
said, with Protestants, that it is enough to confess our sins to God. Guide. de
haer. Matthew Paris. in Henr. 2. But our Ghospellers have reason to blot them out
of the Calendar of their brethren; because they gainsaid the mystery of the
holy Trinity: and acknowledged with the Sabellians one only person in God.

would not see, do now with uniform consent generally confess. For Simon de
Voyon a famous Protestant writes thus: That Anno 605. when Pope Boniface was
installed in his Papal throne, then falsehood got the Victory etc. And then was
the whole world overwhelmed in the dregs of Antichristian filthiness, abominable
superstitions, and traditions of the Pope: then was that vninerfall Apostasy
from the Faith foretold by Paul. In his discourse upon the Cath. doct. in ep.

D. They mingled not water with wine in the dreadful sacrifice. Theophil. in

the fathers for urging it so much, as Whitgift, in his Defense page 473.
Cyprian was greatly ouerseen in making it a matter so necessary in celebration
of the Lords Supper, to have water mingled with wine, which was at that time,
no doubt, common to more the^ him.

E. The Lampetians disanulled the obligation of vows, as a thing repugnant to
Christian liberty: for which cause the Sectaryes of our days discharge
Priests, and other votaryes of their vows of Chastity.

F. The Parermeneutae were so called, because they interpreted holy Scriptures,
according to their own private opinions, and would admit no other Judges then
themselves. Damase V. Parermen. Luther, and his followers do the like, for by
the Scriptures, interpreted by themselves, they will judge of the Church, of
General Counsels, of Fathers, of Apostles, of Angels also. These are Luther
his words lib. de Miss. private. and vnct. sacerd. and tom. 2. Wittember. fol.

Whitaker, Fulk, and our Ghospellers are no less arrogant, when examining all
things by Scriptures, as they are pleased to expound them, they make themselves
suprem judges of Scriptures, Counsels, and whatsoever else. Yea M. Bilson says
part. 2. of his Christian etc. The people must be discerners, and judges of
that, which is taught.

A. The 6. Synod can. 73. attributes adoration to the Cross both with mind

E. Isidorus l. 1. de offic. Eccles. c. 13. and sequent. by a Counsel held in

F. S. Maximus Monk and Martyr in his Comment. in l. 1. Dyon. Areopag. de

Pope Martin the 1. He that receaueth not the 5. holy Synodes, and Venerable
Fathers is accursed: and he that does not confess all things in particular

Claudius Taurinensis. Theoda, a false Prophetess. Godescalcus. Photius a
chief promoter of the Grecian schism. There are cyted also in this age by
some, Ioannes Scotus, not the subtle Doctor; but another of that name.
Fredeuardus, and Bertramus, favorers of the Sacrame^taryes.
P. CLAUDIUS Taurinensis, impugned the adoration of Images, especially of the
holy Cross. Castro. V. Adoratio. To countenance this his error, he abused
with our Protestants that text of Exodus Non facies tibi sculptile.

Q. He reprehended the invocation of Saints, and worshipping of their Relics.

R. He dissalowed pilgrimages chiefly such as were made to Rome forsatisfaction
and remission of sins. Baro. an. 825.

S. Godescalcus renewed the error of the Predestinates, affirming some to be
ordained of God to damnation before the preuision of their sins, and
consequently that God has not a will to save all, nor that he dyed for all,
but only for the elect. Bar. an. 848. which are the very positions of Calvin l.
3. c. 23.. 1. 2. 3. of Fulke in c. 9. ad Rom.. 2.

T. Photius denied Purgatory and suffrages for the dead. Prat. V. Graeci.

V. He affirmed it no sin, to lend money to use, which has been many years
permitted in England, and is now a days wickedly practiced by sundry
Protestants. But although he agreed with them in these and some other erroneous
doctrines; yet he dissented from them in that main article of denying the Holy
Ghosts procession from the Son. Castro V. Dens. haer. 12. and in many other
fundame^tall points.

X. Ioannes Scotus, Fredeuardus, and Bertram seemed to doubt of the Real
presence, although they never absolutely denied it, as Berengarius and our
Sacramentaryes do. Geneb. in Joan. 8. Paschasius epist. ad Fredeuard. tom. 4.
Bibliothecae Patrum, and lib. de Sacra. Alta. where he auerreth, That until
his time, no man declined from the belief of the Real presence, but such as
strayed from Christ. Paschas. in expos. verbo. Christi. Coenantibus eis etc.
And Guitmundus Archbishop of Auersa l. 3. de veritat. corp. and sangu. Christi,
says: It is most apparent at this present that before Berengarius fell into
madness, such furyes were no where noted. Therefore the foresaid persons were
not infected with this heresy. And Claud. Xanct. says, that Bertram was a good
Catholic; that the book of the Sacrament to Carolus Crassus was not his.
Claud. Xanct. repet. 2. c. 14.

P. JONAS Bishop. l. 1. de cult. Imag. The Holy Church upon good Friday,
according to Ecclesiastical tradition adoreth the Cross of Christ. And to the
text of Exodus he answers, as we do now: That God only forbad the making of
Images to adore the^ with the worship of Latria, which is due to God alone.

Q. S. Nicephorus Patriarch of Constantinople, writes to Leo, ep. ad Leo. 3.
That he hops to be saved by the intercession of the immaculate Virgin, and al
Saints. Likewise, I adore (says he and kiss the Venerable Relics of Saints.

X. A Council held at Vercels condemned the book which Scotus wrote of that
matter: witness Lanfrancus lib. de veritat. Eucha. Paschasius also Abbot of
Corbeia addressed an Epistle to Fredeuard, and compiled a learned book in
defense of the Real presence. Haymo in S. Marcum. Strabus in cap. 11. 1. ad
Cor. And Remigius Episcopus Antisiodorensis speaking of the body and blood of
Christ in the Eucharist, says: They are termed bread and wine, according to
Christian ^erity, not that after consecration they do retain the nature of
bread and wine, but only in respect of shape, taste, and smell. For unto him who
could unite the flesh assumed in the womb of the Virgin, personally and
ineffably to his word, and make our mortal bodies by the force of his beck and
command immortal; it is likewise possible to change the substance of bread and
wine, into the nature of his body and blood. Rem epist, Antis. in Psalm. 21.

as members of his Church. Field l. 1. cap. 5. page 70. 71. and 220. yet they
impugned this main article both of their, and our belief, that the holy Ghost
proceeds from the Father and the Son. Ado Vien. in Chron. Joan. Diac. l. 4.
de vita S. Grego. c. 75. and held with us against them, transubstantiation,
Mass, Worshipping of Images, Invocation of Saints etc. Read censuram Ecclesiae
Orient. which Censure is notoriously falsified by D. Morton against prayer to
Saints: where as it expressly aloweth it, allows invocation of our Lady, of the
Apostles etc. And only says, that we ought not to pray unto the^, as Authors
of our good, but as intercessours for us. See likewise Acta Theol. Witte^ber.
and Hierem. Partriar. Constant. de Augustan. Confess. therefore they cannot
make up any part in the Protestants sect, unless they make a monstrous and
prodigious sect composed (as they account them) of many horrible blasphemies,
and divided from it self in substantial, and fundamte^al points.

B. Some Anthropomorphites also continued in this age: neither yet do they
patch up the ragged and torn coat of Protestancy, because they most
fantastically imagined, That God has the form and lineaments of human shape
like unto corruptible me^. Secondly they imitated the Jews in celebrating the
feast of Easter. Thirdly, they counted it a heinous offense for Ecclesiastical
persons to enjoy temporal possessions, pretending that the Apostles inioyed
them not, therefore they renounced the Prelates of the Roman Church, as
straying heerin from the Apostolical paths. Aug. haer. 50. Epiphan. haer. 70.
in Anacepha. Castro V. Ecclesia.

Y. LVitprandus l. 6. hist. c. 6. calls John the Pope of that age, chief and
universal Bishop. Reghino l. 1. Annal. anno 865. They are to be branded with
the Mark of F^lly, who think that Peter's scate may with any false doctrine
deceive, who neither deceived her self, nor ever could by any heresy be
deceived.

Z. Luitprand. l. 4. c. 7. Reghino Abb. in suis annal. de disciplina Eccles.
cap. 190. It is the Priests office to admonish the people out of the pulpit to
offer up prayers for the dead.

A. Anselmus l. de ferment. and azymo. Certain it is, that Christ blessed
unleavened bread. Leo. epist. poster. ad Michaelem Constantinop. Episc. proves
the same our of Scripture, because it was not lawful for the Jews to have any
other at that time then unleavened bread in their houses.

B. They were checked and repressed by Ratherius the renowned Bishop first of
Verona, after of Liege. Sigeber. anno 939. Trithem. in Catal. an. 930. And as
touching the reservation of the Sacrament, which the Anthropomorphites,
impugned, as Protestants do, it was long since (as I have registered above)
defended by S. Cyril in these words. I hear they say, that the mystical
blessing, if any remnants thereof remain till the next day, is unprofitable to
sanctification, but they are madd in so saying. Cyr. ad Calosyr. Which sentence
being urged against Peter Martyr, he answers: Whereas it is subioyned, that
the relics or particles of the Eucharist, reserved unto the next day, do not
cease to be sanctified, it belongs, I wene, to a certain ancient custom etc
which albeit it savor somewhat of superstition, yet Cyrill and others
subscribed thereunto: for immediately after the times of the Apostles men began
to degenerat from the former simplicity of divine worship. Petr. Martyr aduers.
Gardin. And Kemnitius speaking of the same says: it was an ancient custom
largely spread, and long continued etc. that witnesses thereof are Tertullian,
Cyprian, Ambrose, Hierome, Basil, etc. Kemnit. exam. part. 2. page 102. And S.
Cyprian recounteth of a miraculous fire which terrifyed a woman from touching
with unworthy hands the holy Sacrament reserved in a chest. Cypr. sermon. de

the benefit of the Blessed Sacrament, which then he wore about his neck.

The eleauenth Century from the year 1000. unto the 1100.
The chief heads of the Church, and her general Counsels. Her Professors,

head. Their Heresies revived by Protestants. Contradicted and condemned by the
Professors of the Roman Church. A Council held at Rome, having in it 113.
Fathers under Nicolas the second Pope, in which Berengarius the heretic (who
denied the Real presence of Christ's body in the Blessed Sacrament) being
convicted, did abjure that heresy: yet this was no general Council.
SVIDAS, Otbertus, Colomanus, descending from the Royal blood of the Kings of
Scotland, after several pilgrimages to Jerusalem, was at length hanged upon a

wipeth away the objections of our Adversaries, saying: But while we speak
these things, let no man judge us to agree in opinion with those who forbid us
meats which God has created: or to cross the sentence of the Apostle
commanding us to eat whatsoever is set before us, and to reject nothing that
is received with thanksgiving; for it is one thing to avouch that the
creatures of God are indisserently good, and another thing by chastising our
bodies, to provide that we obscrue temperance and purity: good assuredly was
the tree in Paradise as being created by a perfect worke-maister, yet was it
not good to eat thereof, because he himself commanded the contrary.

Roman Catholic.

D. The new Nicolaites were certain Clergy men of Milan, very licentious, who
were called by that name, because they taught it lawful for Ecclesiastical
persons to marry after the vow of Chastity. Baron. an. 1059. And do not the
libertin-Ministers of the new Gospel, both teach and practice the same
doctrine? Has not Joseph Hall published very lately a book in defense of
their wiuing-ministery, excellently refuted by M. Edward Coffin Priest, and
Father of the Society of Jesus?

E. Incestuosi.] The incestuous deserved that infamous name, for allowing
marriage in the fourth degree of co^sanguinity, forbidden by the Canons of of
the Church. Gratianus 35. q. 4. cap. ad Sedem Apostol. Pet. Dam. de contemp.

C. HE was universally condemned by the general voice of the whole Christian
world by Durandus Bishop of Liege, Adalmanus of Brixia, Lanfrancus of
Canterbury, Guitmundus of Auersa in Campania, by Algerus Monk of Corbeia in
Saxony, by Albericus Deacon of Cassinum in the Kingdom of Naples, by Guido of
Aretium in Tuscany, by the most Christian King Robert of France, by Leo the 9.
Victor the 2. Nicolas the 2. Greg. the 7. Popes of Rome, by five several
Counsels assembled at Rome, Toures, and Vercelles against him. And by that
learned and holy Bishop Fulbertus, who lying on his deathbed, when he espied
Berengarius once his scholar, who^ he had sought before to reclaim among
others in his chamber, giving a sign, he commanded him to be expelled out the
room, affirming, that he saw the Devil by him with a fawning hand, alluring
many to follow him. Sigeb. an. 994. Onuph. an. 1001. Baro. 1059. And the
forenamed Authors condemned that opinion of his, as new, contrary to the
doctrine of the whole Church, never taught, or believed before, which
Berengarius himself recanted at his death. Baro. an. 1088. so unconstant an
Apostle have our Sectaryes, and so strange was their heresyin this age: whereas
our real presence was so uniformly taught in this and al precedent ages, as
Anton. de Adamo in his Anatomy of the Mass page 236. says: I have not yet
hitherto been able to know, when this opinion of real and bodily being of
Christ in the Sacrament did begin,

D. Pet. Dam. in l. ad Nic. PP. and Pope Nicolas the 2. sending his Legates to
Millan, reclaimed them from that sacrilege condemned also in a Council at
Rome. dial. 32. c. Praeter.

E. By two Councils held at Rome under Alexand. 2. and by Pet. Damia. Who
reports of an incestuous person, after his contempt of those decrees, killed

Wedlock.

interpreting mystically the Pope to be Antichrist. Prate. V. Petrus Ioannis:
yet Protestants cannot without blasphemy combine with these: because the
Bongomiles believed not in the B. Trinity: they feygned God to be of humane

I Mentioned not in the former age the errors of Petrus Abailardus, for
although M. Simons upon the Reuelat. p. 142. most ignora^tly lays claim unto
him: yet in no one point does he wholly accord with our modern Protestants.

K. He denied all liberty of freewill even in civil actions; denied God to be
the author of al good things; affirmed the holy ghost to be the soul of the
world; said nothing was to be believed but that which natural reason leads
us unto; with other horrible blasphemies against Christ, against God, and the
B. Trinity, recorded and acknowledged by Zuinglius and Oecolampad. lib. ep.
page 710. and 716. and by the Centurists cent. 12. col. 848. 849.

L. Almaricus is challenged by Protestants, by Fox Act. and Mon. page 70. by
White sect. 50. 38. for that he gainsaid with them the real presence and
transubstantiation. Prat. V. Almaricus.

M. He accused the Church of idolatry, for inuocating Saints, for Censing their
images, for erecting Altars with in scription of their names. Prat. V.
Almaricus. Geneb. in Innocent. 3. ex Aemilio.

N. He taught that every faithful man was bound to believe himself to be a
member of Christ, and this he held as an article of faith. Vincent. in spec. l.
29. c. 107. And do not our Protestants generally avouch, that every one ought
to believe himself to be one of the elect, and sure of his salvation? See M.
Whitaker and M. Abbot touching this point Controuer. 24. who^ David Dinantius
followed: yet they both denied the resurrection of our bodies; they denied
Paradise, and Hell; denied the Blessed to see God in himself, but only in his
creatures; denied the disstinction of male and female sex, and consequently
all procreation in the state of innocence. And David Dinantius added, that God
is that which the Philosophers call materia prima, first matter. Prat. V.
Almaricus, and V. David Dinantius, Gualt. in sec. 13. I do not envy our
Ghospellers the prerogative of such forerunners.

O. Gulielmus de Sancto Amore is named by M. White in his way to the church
sect. 50. 34. as a favorer of their profession, and yet he only reproved the
free and voluntary poverty of religious persons. Castro V. Paupertas. In other
points he believed with the Catholic church, Transubstantiation, Sacrifice of
the Mass, the Popes Supremacy, yea all those fundamental points of our faith,
which in M. Whitakers blind conceit, raise the grounds of true Religion.
Whittak. Contr. 2. q. 6.

K. HIS Book (says S. Bernard epist. 192. ad Guidonem) in which he peraersly
delights, gives sentence against him, when he speaks of the Trinity, he
sauoureth of Arius, when of grace, he sauoureth of Pelagius, when of the person
of Christ, he sauoureth of Nestorius. And Innocentius the Pope in Rescripto
epist. 194. inter ep. Bernard. By the authority of the holy Canons we have
condemned all the wicked doctrines of Petrus Abailardus, together with the
Author, and we have imposed on him, as on an heretic perpetual silence.

L. The general Council of Lateran assembled in the year of our Lord 1215.
under Innocentius the 3. defines the real presence and transubsta^tiation
against him, Can. 1. Read the words in the former page col. 3 Likewise the
same Council Can. 2. says: We renounce and condemn the most peevish opinion
of wicked Almaricus, whose mind the father of lies has so blinded, as his
doctrine seems not so much heretical as frantic. This was one of the most
renowned Councels of al Europe, for there were in it Fathers above 1280. the
Patriarchs of Jerusalem and Constantinople, 70. metropolita^s, 400. Bishops,
Abbots 12. Conuentuall Priors 800. the Legates of the Grecian and Roman Empire,

M. S. Tho. 2. 2. q. 103. and q. 83. freeeth the practice of our Church therein
from Idolatry. Then Innocent. de alt. mist. l. 2. c. 96. shows the mystical

voluntary poverty. Again the same S. Thomas ad sextum, alleging the sentence
of S. Gregory: Who out of their store do minister relief to the needy, offer
unto God a sacrifice, yet less worthy: But who reserve nothing to themselves,
offer an oblation greater then any other kind of Sacrifice. Condemned also he
was by Pope Alexander the 4.

Q. Diverse learned men of that time and immediately after, wrote against him
and condemned his errors, as namly John Kyningham, Richard Maidston, Thomas
Winterton, John Gascoin, William Woodford, with sundry others. The two famous
universities of Oxford and Prage; the Archbishops of Canterbury, York, and

the whole Church, the father and teacher of all Christians: and to him in the

General, and most venerable Council. Council Florent. sess. vltima.

Now the long festred ulcer, or byle of Protestancy is fully ripe, and the
whole corruption breaks forth by Luther Calvin and the rest of their
accomplices. For,

A. Luther impugned the authority of General Councels, Invocation and Honor
of Saints, Free Will, Vows, Supremacy, Confirmation, Penance, Orders,
Matrimony, extreme Unction, Indulgences, private mass, merit, justification of
works and the like.

B. Calvin impugned the same: and besides, the real presence, worship of
images, Purgatory, Prayer for the dead, necessity of Baptism with diverse
others now defended by our English sectaryes; yet with such irreconciliable
ia^res and hateful variances among themselves, as neither their first parents
Luther and Calvin nor any two of their followers can jointly accord in all
essential points, to lay the first stones of their new, disioynted and
tottering building. For Luther even to his dying day detested the Caluinists as
frantic heretics for denying the real presence. Confess. Tigur. tract. 3.
fol. 108. Calvin is even with Luther, calling him Idolatram, an Idolater,
because he termed the Eucharist, Sacramentum adorable, a Sacrament worthy to be
adored. Calvin. ep. 72. ad Bucer. Luther rejected the epistle of S. Paul to the
Hebrews, the epistle of S. James etc. Luth. in Prol. Harm. Ep. Calvin, with
the Church, admits them as canonical. in Confess. Possiaca. And besides,
many other substantial differences between them and their followers, of which
I have spoken sufficiently heretofore part. 3. c. 15. Luther denied the
immortality of the soul. He taught that the divine essence begets, and is
begotten, which destroieth the very nature of God. For that which begets or
breaths must be really distinct from that which is begotten or breathed, and
so there follows not an unity, but a duality or perfect trinity in the
essence as well as in the persons. Read what he writes. I permit that the Pope
make articles of his says, to those that be his faithful, such as are, bread
and wine to be tra^substantiated in the Sacramen^; he ^ffence of God neither to
beget, nor to be begotten; the soul to be a substantial form of the b^dy of
man; himself to be the Emperor of the world, and the King of heaven, and an
earthl^ God; the soul to be immortal, and all those infinite monsters
contained in the Roman dunghill of Decrees. Thus Luther word by word, tom. 2.
impress. Wittem. an. 1546. in assert. ar. 27. Whereby you see that he makes
the articles of the souls immortality, the essence of God neither to beget,
nor to be begotten, monsters devised by the Roman Bishop.

A HE was reresisted and condemned by Pope Leo the 10. by Charles the Emperor,

Orders, 39. Procurators. And besides the whole Catholic Church, the Sectaries

this dotage of his: The divinity is threefold eue^ as the persons. Luther in
Conf. Poss^a. affirming, that, in these words grauiss^mi errores latitant;
most grievous errors lie hidden. Wicelius biddoth him retracte, the monstrous

struck this Heretik^, that having desp^ired of his salvation, having ^^led
upon d^uels* swearing, cursing, and bla^^hemi^g, he most miserable yielded up
his wicked ghost, dying of the lowsy disease, worms so increasing in an

the Roman Church. By which only Church as you see, all Countries have been
converted, all general Counsels assembled and confirmed, the heretics of all
ages condemned, out of which Church all sects and Sectaryes have departed, from
which they have embezelled all their Ecclesiastical, and approved Rites,
Sacraments, Laws, Ceremonies etc. And yet the Roman Church, never borrowed the
least rite or ceremony from any, never departed from the Communion of a more
ancient Church; but still remains in the Center, and root of her first

Miracles. Diverse wrought at this very time in all parts of Christendom: but
I will only touch here those of our bordering Countries, achieved in the
presence of many living and eye witnesses: to wit, the miraculous cures done at
our Ladies of Hall, and Sichem recorded by that eloquent and famous Writer
Iustus Lipsius, in his books, the one entitled, Virgo Hallcusis, the other
Diua Sichemiensis, sieve Aspricollis; amongst which very memorable is that,
which fell out in the year of our Lord 1603. mentioned by him in the 45.
Chapter Diuae Sichemie^sis. Of one John Clement lame from his nativity, and of
a monstrous shap or compositio^ of body; his thighs and feet were contracted,
and turned toward to the forpart of his breast, so that his knees did grew and
clean fast thereunto; his limbs so trust up, as he was unable to stand, lie,
or walk, only a^le to sit, and sitting to crawle etc. Who moved with the same
of that holy place, was carried in a Wagon to Sichem, and crept into the
Virgins chapel, where after he had expiated his sins by Confession and
penance, and received the holy Sacrament etc. as he stood before the Altar, he
sell: his withered and contorted fee^ loosed and stretched forth, so that he
presently stood upright, to the great amazement of himself, and others etc.
These things were there seen by the people, seen at Louaine, seen at
Bruxels, when he returned, and who did not run to meet him? Thus Lipsius. I
might add many others related by him, of all which he gives this testimony in
the beginning of his first chapter: Behold things done in the eyes and ears
of us all, behold them celebrated with concourse, applause, fruit or benefit
of Countries! What truth can there be in humane affairs, if no truth be given
to these things? Another most renowned was done in the County of Burgundy in
the year 1608. whereas in a Church of our Lady, on the day of Pentecost, the
Blessed Sacrament was exposed upon a silver Reliquary, to the view of the
people, a sudden fire by chance consumed not only the ornaments, and
Altar-cloaths, but even the very step it self, on which it ^ested, and yet
the Reliquary with the sacred host remained untouched, and without prop or stay
hanged in the air, the space of 33. hours, from Whitsunday in the afternoon
till next Twesday morning (in the sight not only of the townsmen of Fauernum,
but of the inhabitants thereby, who flocked thither in great multi^udes) until
a Reverend Priest saying Mass, it descended by little and little for him to
receive: which the Archbish. of Bisuntum iuridically examined, and sound to be
^rue by the authentical depesition of 52. witnesses most worthy of credit. In
h^st. Vesunt. primum, deinde Lugdun* edita, apud Petrum Rigaudum. By which it
is manifest that the Roman faith has been always sealed with such warrant
from God in every age, as we may conclude with Ricardus de S. Victore: O Lord,
if it be error which we believe, we are deceived by thee; for thou have

thee. lib. 1. de Trinit. cap. 2.

of their assertions I omit as notoriously known, and daily vented with such
variance amongst themselus, and from their first founders, with such repugnance
to the Scriptures, and Fathers of the Primitive Church; as M. Rogers could not
translate S. Austines Meditations or Soliloquies, without dissenting from him
in many principal points of our religion, wilfully rejected and suppressed by
him: for which he thus pleads his excuse. It stood me upon both for my own
credit, and also for the behoof of others, to leave somewhat out, for had I
not so done etc. I should have said, that the Angels as for diverse other ends,
so for this are appointed, that they offer the Prayers of the children of God,
in the fight of his Majesty. cap. 15. I should have said, that the same Angels
do bring our groans and sighs to God, that they may obtain for us, the
favorable propitiation of his benignity, and return to us the desired
blessing of his grace. cap. 27. I should have said that our Savior descended
into hell where our for fathers sat in darkness. cap. 32. Finally I should
have said that we ought to doubt, whether we shall ariue to the port of
Salvation or no, because all things are reserved uncertain for the time to
come. Hitherto Rogers, word by word, only that I change into English the
sayings of S. Augustine, which he to hide his coozenage, from the illiterate,
cites only in Latin. Rogers in his epist. dedicat. More audacious was the
translatour of the same Authors work de ciuit. Dei, who coming to those
words (lib. 22. c. 8.) Obtulit sacrific^ Corporis Christi, he offered the
Sacrifice of the body o^ Christ, without cloak of excuse, Englisheth them
thus, He ministered the Communion, rather choosing to wrong his own conscience,
and pervert the words and meaning of so great a Clarke, then to allow with him
the Sacrifice of the Mass. But no marvel, for as the Ghospel of our
Sectaries was first broached by lies, treacheries, corruptions, deprauations,
etc. So by the same perfidiousnes it is still maintained, as Zanchius, one of
their own side, truly witnesses of himself, and his fellow Protestants
thus. I have re^ule (says he) the Latin Copy of the Apology, and diligently
read it over, not without Choler, when I perceived what manner of writing very
many, let me not say for the most part, all, do use in the Churches (as they
are called) of the Reformed Ghospel; who would seem notwithstanding to be
Pastors, Doctors, and pillars of the Church. The state of the question, that
it may not be understood, we often of set purpose ouercloude with darkness;
things which are manifest we impudently deny; things false without shame we
avouch; things plainly impious we propose as the first principles of Faith;
things orthodoxall we condemn of heresy; Scriptures at our pleasure we
detorte to our own dreams; we boast of Fathers, when we will follow nothing
less then their doctrine; to deceive, to calumniate, to rail is samiliar with
us; neither do we think or regard, how much with these our writings the
current of the Gospel is hindered, the Churches of Christ are ruined,
Sectaryes are strengthened in their heresies, Tyrants are encouraged to take
arms against us; and in fine the Kingdom of Satan is furthered and promoted:
but so as we may defend our cause, good or bad, by right or by wrong, all other
things we turn vpside down. O times! O manners! So he, in Epist, ad Io.
Sturmium. habetur in fine lib. 7. and 8. Miscellan.

C. Reuerned Father Gretser, and Tanner convince the contrary in the foresaid
Conference at Ratisbone.

D. Becanus purposely refuteth him, alleging among other arguments this
sentence of S. Prosper ex libel. ad articul. sibi falso impositos, art. 3. God
truly is the Creator of all men: but no man was created by him to this end,
that he might perish; for there is one cause of being made, another of being
destroyed. That men are made, it is the favor of the Creator* that men are
destroyed, it is the fault of the preuaricatour. Becan. opusc. 11. q. 3.

E. Cardinal Peron justifies that custom, and vnd^n^ably proves, how the
Church might upon just cause change the communion of both kinds into one,
because both are only requisite to the integrity of the signification, not to
the integrity of the essence of the Sacrament: for so she changed, in the
Sacrament of Baptism immersion into aspersion, by reason of danger to infants
and other inconueniencies mentioned by S. Chrysostom ep. 1. ad Innocent.
Notwithstanding that Christ commanded an immersio^, dipping, or plunging into
the water as the Greek word (...) does import. No^withstanding the Apostles,
and the a^cient Church long practiced it. Notwithstanding it was necessary to
the integrity of the signification of our death and burial with Christ; though
not necessary to the essence and substance of Baptism. Card. Per. lib. 6 page
1112. 1113. 1114. etc.

F. Becanus notably establishes the truth of the one, and the inualidity of
the other, against him. Bec. de Eccl. Repub. So does Fidelis Annosus in Censuia
page 93. 94. 95. etc. and page 150. 151. where he proves the Supremacy by
Luther, Mclancthon, and other heretics, and conuinceth the marriage of
Votaries out of S. Basil, S. Chrysostom, S. Ambrose, S. Hierome, and S. Cypran
to be whoredom, incest, adultery, or worse then adultery. Eudemon Ioannis, and
others, I let pass who do the lil^, and learnedly refute all his other
heretical positions.
