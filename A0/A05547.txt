The complaynte and testament of a Popiniay

Which lies sore wounded and may not dye, till every man has herd what he
says:

Wherefore gentle readers haste you yt he were out of his pain.





Incipit prologus.
_(...)ppose I had ingyne angelical
(...)ith sapience super salomonicall
^ not what matter put in memory
The poetis old in style heroycall
In breue subtle terms rethoricall
Of euerylk matter tragedy and story
So ornatly to their hie laud and glory
Has done indite whose supreme sapience
Transcendeth fer, the dull intelligence.
Of poetis now in till our vulgar tongue
For why the bell of retorik is roung
By Chaucer Goweir and Lidgate laureate
Who dare presume these poetis till impoung
Whose sweet sentence through Albion been soung
Or who can now the works contrefate
Of kennedy with termis aureate
Or of dumbar whylk language had at large
As may be seen in till his goldin targe
Quintyne / Me^^^^^r / ^wle / Henderson / Hay / and holland
Though they been deed her libellis been lyuand
Whilke to rehearse makes reders to rejoice
Alas for one whilk lamp was of this land
Of eloquence the flowyng balmy strand
And in our Inglysshe rethoryk the roise
As of rubeis the charbuncle been choice
And as Phoebus does sinthea precell
So Gawane douglase bishop of dunkell,
Had when he was in to this land on live
Above vulgar poets prerogatyue
Both in practik and speculation
I say no more good reders may descryue
His worthy works in number mo than five
And specially in the true translation
Of Uirgyll whilk been consolation
To cunnyng men to know his great ingyne
As well in natural science as divine
And in the court been present in this days
That balletes breuis lustely and lays
Whylkes to our prince daily they do present
Who can say more than sir James Inglysshe says
In ballattes farssis and in plesand plays
But Culrose has his pen made impotent
Kid in cunnyng and practik right prudent
And steward whilk desiris a stately style
Full ornate works daily does compyle.
Steward of lorn will carp right curiously
Galbrayt kinloch when they list them apply
In to that art ar crafty of ingyne
But now of late is stert up hastily
A cunnyng clerk whilk writes craftily
A plant of poets callid ballantyue
Whose ornate works my wit can not defyne
Get he in the court auctorite
He will precell Quintyne and kenedy.
So though I had ingyne as I have none
I wot not what to write be sweit saint Iohane
(...)y in all the garth of eloquence
(...) nothing left but barayne stok and stone
The polit terms / are pullid every one
Be these fornamid poetis of prudence
And seeing I find none other new sentence
I shall declare or I depart you fro
The complant of a woundid papingo.
Wherefore because my matter been so rude
Of sentence and of rethorik denude
To rurale folk my dityng been direct
Fer flemit from the sight of men of good
For cunning men I know will sone conclude
It dow nothing but for to be deiect
And when I here my matter been detract
Than shall I swear I made it but in mowes
To vplandishe lassis whilk keeps kye and yowes
Here endis the prologue
Who clymmis to high perforce his fete (...)
Express I shall that by experience
If that ye please to here a pituouse tale
How a fair bird by fatale violence
Deuourid was and might make no defense
Contrary the death so fails natural strength
As after I shall show you at more length
A papingo right pleasant and perfyte
Presentid was to our most noble king
Of whom his grace long time had great delight
More fair of form I wot flew never with whing
This proper bird he gave in governing
To me whylk was his semple seruiture
On whom I did my deligence and cure
To learn her language artificial
To play plat foot and whissill fot before
But of her inclination natural
She countrefeted all foulis less and more
Of her courage she would with out my lore
Sing like the merle / and kraw like the cock
Pew like the gled / and chant like the lauerocke.
Bark like a dog / and kekill like a ka
Blait like a hog / and buller like a bulle
Gaile like a gock / and great when she was wa
Clyme on a cord / sing laughe and play the fule
She might have been a menstrell against you will
This blisfull bird was to me so pleasand
Where ever I went / I bare her on my hand.
The description of her murnyng.
And so befell upon a mirthfull morrow
In to my garth I past me to repose
This bird and I as we were wont afforowe
Among the flowers fresshe fragrant and formose
My vital sprete duly did rejoice
When phoebus rose and raise the cloudis sable
Through bryghtnes of his bemes amiable
Without vapoure was well purificate
The temperat air soft sober and serene
The earth by nature so edificate
With wholesome herbs blewe / white / reed / and grene
Whilkis eleuate my spretis from the spleen
That day Saturn nor Mars did not appear
Nor Eol out of his cave durst not stere.
That day perforce behooved to be fair
By influence and course celestial
No planet pressid for to perturbe the air
For Mercurius be moving natural
Exalted was in to the trone triumphall
Of his mansion unto the fyftene gre
In his own souerayn sign of virginye
That day did phoebus plesantly depart
From Gemini and enterid in Cancer
That day cupido did extend his dart
Uenus that day communed with Jupiter
That day Neptunus hid him like a sker
That day dame nature with great besines
Furth^^^d flora to prove her craftines
And retrograid was Mars in Capricorn
And sinthea in sagittar assesid
That day dame Ceres gods of the corn
Full joyfully Johan vpland applesid
The bad aspect of Saturn was appesid
That day by Juno of Jupiter the Joy
Perturbynge spretis caused to hold coy.
The sound of birdis surmounted all the skies
With melody of notis musical
The balmy droppis of dew Tytan up dryis
Hanging upon the tender twystis small
The heavenly hew and sound angelical
Sik perfyte pleasure prentid in my heart
That with great pain from thens I might depart
So still among the herbis amyable
I did remayn a space for my pastance
But wordly pleasure been so variable
Mixid with sorrow, dread and inconstance
That found therein is no contynuance
So might I say my short solace alas
Was driven in dolor in a little space.
For in that garth among the fragrant flowers
Walkyng alone none but my bird and I
Unto the time that I had said my hours
This bird I set upon a branche me by
But she began to clymbe right spedely
And in that tree she did so hie ascend
That by no way I might her apprehend
(...)de I said beware, mount not over hye
(...) in time, perchance thy fete may fail
Thou art right fat, and not well used to fle
The gredy glede, I dread shall the assail
I will ascend quod she, chance what be chance me
It is my kind to clym ay to the hight
Of fether and bone, I wot well I am wight
So on the highest little tender twyst
With whynges displayde she sat full wantonly
But Boreas blewe a blast or ever she wist
Whylk brake the branch, and blewe her suddenly
Down to the ground with many a careful cry
Upon a stub she light on her breest
The blood russhed out, and she cried for a priest
God wot if than my heart was woe begone
To se that foul flytter among the flowers
Whylk with great mournyng began to make her moan
Now are come said she my fatale hours
Of bitter death now must I suffer the shoures
O dame nature I pray the of thy grace
Lend me leisure to speak a little space
For to complain my fate unfortunate
And bequeth my natural gere or I depart
Seeing of all comfort I am desolate
Alone except the death with his darte
With awful chere ready to perse my heart
And with that word she took a passion
Syne flatiynges fell and swapped in to swowne
With sorry heart persed with compassion
And salt teres distelling from mynt eyne
To hear that birdis lamentation
I did approach under a hauthorne grene
Where I might here and se, and not be seen
And when this bird had swowned twyse or thryse
She began to speak saying on this wise
O false fortune why have thou me begyled
This day at morn who knew this careful case
Uayne hope in the my reason has exiled
Having sik trust in to thy feyned face
That ever I was brought to the court alas
Had I in forest flowne among my feres
I might full well have lived many years.
Wise and true counsel alas I did refuse
Again reason vsyng my appetite
Ambition did so my heart abuse
That Eolus had me in great dispite
Poetis of me has matter to indyte
Whylk clam so hye and woe is me therefore
Not doubtyng that death durst me deuore.
This day at morn my form and fetheren fair
Above the proud pecok were prece land
And now a caytyfe carrion full of care
Bathing in blood down from my heart distelland
And in my ear the bell of death been knelland
O false world fie on thy felicite
Thy pride, avarice, and immundicite.
In the I se nothing been permanent
Of thy short solace sorrow is the end
Thy false unfortunate gifts been but lent
This day full proud the morn nothing to spend
O ye that does pretend ay till ascend
My fatale end have in remembrance
And you defend from sik unhappy chance.
Whether I was stryken in ecstasy
Or through a stark ymagination
But it appears in my fantasy
I herd this dolent lamentation
Thus dullid in to desolation
Me thought this bird did discriue in her manner
Her counssall to the king as ye shall here.
Here begynnes the first Epistell of the papingo derect till her souerane lord
king James the fifth.
PRepotent prince pereles of pulchritude
Glory / honor / laud / triumph / and victory
Be to thy hie excellent celsitude
With merciall dedis digne of memory
Seeing Atropos consumed has my glory
And dolent death alas must us depart
I bequeth to the my true unfeigned heart
To gidder with this cedull subsequent
^ith most reverend recommendacyon
I grant thy grace gettis many a document
Be famous faders predication
With many notable narracyon
Be pleasand poetis in style heroycall
How thou should guide thy seat imperial.
Some does deplore the great calamities
Of diverse realms transmutation
Some petiusly does trete of tragedies
All for thy graces informacyon
So I intend without adulacyon
In my barbarous rusticall indite
Among others sir, somthynge for to write
Sovereign conceive this syple similitude
Of officeres serving thy segnory
^ho guydes them well gettis of thy grace great good
^ho been iniust degraded ar of glory
And cauncelled out of thy memory
Providing syne more pleasand in their place
Believe, right so shall god do with thy grace
Considering well thou been but officiare
And va^^ell to that king incomparable
haest the to please that puissant prince preclare
Thy rich reward shall be inestimable
Exalted hye in glory vnterminable
Above archangels vertus and potestates
Pleasantly placid among the principates.
Of thy virtue poets perpetually
Shall make mencyon unto the world be ended
So thou exercise thy office prudently
In heaven and earth thy grace shall be commended
Wherefore beware that he be not offended
Whilk has exalted the to sik honor
Of this people to be a governor.
And in the earth has made sik ordinance
Under thy fete all thing terrestrial
Are subject to thy pleasure and pastance
Both foul and fish and bestes pastoral
Men to thy service and women they been thrall
Hawkyng / huntyng / iustyng / and laufull amor
Preordinate ar by god for thy pleasour.
Masters of musik to recreate thy sprete
With dauted voice and pleasant instrument
Thus may thou be of all pleasure replete
So that in thy office thou be diligent
But be thou found sleuthfull or necligent
Or else iniust in thine execution
Thou shall not fail deuyne punycyon.
Wherefore seeing thou has sik capacite
To learn to play so pleasantly and sing
Ride horses / ryue speres with great audacite
Shote with handbow crossebow and culuering
Among the rest, sir, learn to be a king
Prove on that craft thy pregnant fresh ingine
Granted to the by influence deuyne
And seeing the diffinicion of a king
Is for to have of people governance
Adresse the, first above all other thing
To put thy body to such ordinance
That thy virtue thine honor may auaunce
For how should pryncis govern great regions
That can not only guide their own persons.
And thy grace would live right pleasantly
Call thy counsel and cast on them the cure
Their just decretis defend and fortefy
Without good counsel may no prince long endure
Wyrke with counsel then shall thy work be sure
Chose thy counsel of the most sapient
Without regard to blood, riches or rent
Among all other pastyme and pleasure
Now in thy adolescent years yenge
Would thou every day study but half an hour
The regiment of princely gouernynge
To thy people it were a pleasant thing
Their might thou find thy own vocation
How thou should use thy scepture swerd and crown.
The cronicles to know I the exhort
Which may be myrrour to thy majesty
There shalt thou find both good and evil report
Of every prince after his qualite
Though they been deed their deeds shall not dye
Trust will thou shalt be styled in that storye
As thou deseruest put in memory.
Request that roy which rent was on the roode
The to defend from deeds of defame
That no poet report of the but good
For princes days endures but a dream
Seeing first king Fergus bare a diadeame
Thou art the last king of five score and five
And all ar deed and none but thou on live.
Of whose nombre fyftye and five been slain
And most part in their own mysgouernaunce
Wherefore I the beseech my sovereign
Consider of their lives the circumstaunce
And when thou know the cause of their myschaunce
Of virtue than exalte the sails on hye
Trusting to escape that fatal destenye
Entreat every true baron as he were thy brother
Which mon at need the and thy realm defend
When suddenly one does oppress an other
Let justice myxed with mercy them amend
Have thou their hertes, thou have enough to spend
And by the contrary, thou art but king of bone
From time thine here is hettes be from the gone.
I have no leisure for to write at length
My hole intent unto thine excellence
Decreassed so I am in wit and strenth
My mortal wound does me such violence
People of me may have experience
Because alas I was incounsolable
Now mou I dye a caytyue miserable.
Here begins the second epistle of the Papingo, dyrecte to her brether of
the Court.
BRether of court with mind precordiall
To the great god hertely I commend you
Imprent my fall in your memoryall
Together with this cedull that I send you
To preysse over hye I pray you not pretend you
The vain ascence of court who will consydder
Who syttes most hye, shall find the seat most slydder
So ye that now been lansing up the ledder
Take tent in time holding your fyngers fast
Who clymmeth most hye, most dynt has of the wedder
And leest defense against the bitter blast
Of falls fortune whylke takes never rest
But most redoubted daily she down thrynges
Not sparing papes, emperors, nor kings.
Though ye been mounted up above the skies
And has both king and court in governance
Some was as hye whylk now right low lies
Complaning sore the courts variaunce
Their preterit time may be experience
Whylk through vain hope of court did clyme so hye
Syne wanted whingis when they wend best to fly
Seeing ylk court been untrust and transitorye
Chaungyng as often as wether cock in wind
Some making glad and other some right sorye
Formest this day the morn may go behind
Let not vain hope of court your reason blind
Trust well some men will give you land as lords
Whylkes would be glad to se you hang in cords
I durst declare the miserabilite
Of diverse courts were not my time to short
The dreadful change vaynglory and vilite
The paynefull pleasures as poets does report
Sometime in hope sometime in disconfort
And how some men does spend their youthed all
In court, syne, ends in the hospital.
How some in court been quiet counsalours
Without regard to commen wealth or kings
Casting their cure for to be conquerours
And when they been hye raised in their rings
How change of court them dolefully down thrynges
And when they been from their estate deposed
How many of their fall been right well resioysed
And how fond feigned fules and flatterars
For small service opteyneth great rewards
Pandars pikthankes custrouns and clatterars
Loupes up from laddes, syne lyghtes among lords
Blasphematours braggars and common bardes
Sometime in court has more auctorite
Than well learned doctors in divinity.
How in some court be barnes of Beliall
Full of dissimuled painted flattery
Provoking by intoxicate counsall
Princes to hooredome and till hasardry
Who does in princes prent syk harlotry
I say for me such pert prouocatours
Should punissed be above all strong traitors.
What trauars, trouble, and calamite
Has been in court within this hundredth years
What mortal chaunges, what myserite
What noble men be brought upon their bears
Trust well my friends follow ye mon your fears
So seeing in court is no tranquilite
Set not on it your hole felicite
The court changes sometime with sik outrage
That few or none may make resistance
And spares not the prince more than the page
As well appears by experyence
The duke of Rosey might make no defense
Whylke was pertenand roy of this region
But dulefully deuored in prison
What dread, what dolor, had that noble king
Robert the third from time he knew the case
Of his two sons the dolent departing
Prince David deed, and James capityue alas
Till true scotts men, whylk was a careful case
Thus may ye know the court been varyand
When blood ryall the change might not gaynstand.
Who clam in court more hye and tryumphand
Nor duke Murdok, while that his days endured
Was he not great protector of Scotland
Yet of the court he was not well assured
It changed so his lange service was smured
He and his sone fair walter without remeed
Forfalted were, and put to dulefull deed
King James the first, patron of prudence
Gem of angyne, and perle of polecy
Well of justice, and floode of eloquence
Whose virtue does transcende my fantasy
For to discryue yet when he stood most hye
By false exhorbitant conspyracyoun
That prudent prince was pituously put down
Als James the second, roy of great renoun
Being in his super excellent glore
Through rerheleffe shotyng of one great cannoun
The dolent death alas did him deuore
One thing there is, of whylk I marvel more
That fortune had at him syk mortal feed
Through fyfty thousand to wale him by the heed
My heart is persed with pains for to paunce
Or write that courts variacyon
Of James the third when he had governance
The dolor, dread, and desolacyon
The change of court and conspiracion
And how that cochrane with his company
That time in court clam so presumptuously
It had been good those barons had been unborn
By whom that noble prince was so abused
They grew as did the wede above the corn
That prudent lords counsel was refused
And held him quiet as he had been inclused
Alas that prince by their abusyon
Was finally brought unto confusyon
They clam so hye, and get such audience
And with their prince grew so famylyar
His germane brother might get no presence
The duke of Albane, nor the earl of Mar
Like banysshed men were holden at the bar
Till in the king there grew syk mortal feed
He flemit the duke, and put the earl to deed
This cochrane with his caytyue company
Forced them to fle, but yet they wanted tedders
Above the hyelyders of Libanye
They clam so hye tylt they lap over the ledders
On Lauder brig syne kepped were in tedders
Strangled to death, they got none other grace
Their king captyue, which was a careful case
Till put in form that fate unfortunate
And mortal change perturbeth mine ingyne
My wits ben weyke / my fyngers fatigate
To dyte or write the rancour ruin
The ciuyll war, the battle intestyne
How that the sone with banner broad displayed
Again the father in battle came arrayed
Would god that prince had been that day comfortid
With sapience of the prudent Salomone
And with the strengh of strong Sampsone supportid
With the bold oste of great Agamennone
What should I wish remedy was there none
At morn a king with ceptour sword and croun
At even a deed deformed carioun
Alas where is that right redouted roy
That potent prince gentill king James the ferd
I pray to Christ his saul for to conuoy
One greater noble raygned not in erd
O Atropos wary we may thy werd
For he was myrrour of humilite
Lood ster and lamp of liberalite
During his time so justice did prevail
The savage ylis trubled for terror
Eskdaile emsdaile liddisdaile and anuerdaile
Durst not rebel doutyng his dintis dour
And of his lords had sik perfect savor
So forte shawe that he fered no fone
Out through his realm he would ride him alone.
And of his court through Ewrop sprang the fame
Of lusty lords and lufsome ladies yeng
Triumphant tornays Iusting and knyghtly gain
With all pastyme according for a king
He was the glory of pryncely gouernynge
Till through the ardent love he had to France
Against Ingland did move his ordinance
Of Flowdon field the ruin to reuolue
O^ that most dolent day for to deplore
Inyn, for dread that dolor you desolue
Shew^ how that prince in his tryumphant glore
Destroyed was, what needs process more
Not by virtue of the English ordinance
But by his own wylfull mysgouernaunce
Alas that day had he ben consolable
He had opteyned laud, glory, and victory
Whose petuous process been so lamentable
Ine w^ll, at length it put in memory
I never red in tragedye nor story
At one journey so many nobles slain
For the defense and love of their sovereign
Now brether make in your remembrance
A myrrour of their mutabilities
So may ye know the courts inconstaunce
When princes been thus pulled from their sees
After whose death whose strange aduersitees
What great mysrule in to this region rang
When our young prince couth neither speak nor gang
During his tender youth and innocence
What sloth, what stelth, what murder and myschaunce
There was naught else but werkynge of vengence
In that court there range syk varyaunce
Diverse rulers, made diverse ordinance
Somtyne our queen reigned in authority
Sometime the prudent duke of Albanie
Sometime the realm was ruled by regentes
Sometime leeftenauntes ledars of the law
Than reigned so money inobedientes
That few or none of an other stood in awe
Oppression did so loud his bugle blawe
That none durst ride but in the feyr of weir
Iak vpland that time did mysse his meir.
Who was more hye in honor eleuate
Nor was Margarete our hye and mithty princes
Such power was to her appropriate
Of king and realm she was gouernores
Yet came one change within a short process
That perle preclare that lusty pleasand queen
Long time durst not in the corut be seen
The archebisshop of saint Androus James Beton
Chancellar and primate in power pastoral
Clam next the king / most hye in this region
The ledder shook he lap and gat a fall
Authority nor power spiritual
Riches frendiship might not that time prevail
When dame Curia began to stere her tail.
His high prudence prevailed him not a myte
That time the court bare him syk mortal feed
As presoner they kept him in despite
And sometime wist not where to hide his heed
But disguysed like John^ the reif he raed
Had not been hope that bare him company
He had been strangled by melancoly
What cummet and care was in the court of France
When king Francys was takin presonere
The duke of Bourbon and his ordinance
Deed at one stroke right balefully brought on bear
The court of Rome that time ran all arere
When pape Clement was put in strong preson
The noble city put to confusion
In England who had greater governance
Nor their tryumphand courtly cardinal
The common weal some says he did auaunce
By equal justice both to great and small
There was no prelate to him peregall
English men says, had he raygned long space
He had deposed saint Peter of his place
His pryncely pomp, nor papale grauite
His palace royal rich and radious
Nor yet the flude of superfluite
Of his riches nor travail tedious
From time dame Curia held him odious
Prevailed him not nor prudence most profounde
The ledder brake and and he fell to the ground
Where been the doughty earls of douglas
Whylkes ryally in to this region rang
Forfayt and slain what needs more process
The earl of March was marchelled them amang
Dame Curia them dolefully down thrang
And now of late who clam more hye amang us
Nor did archbald vmwhyle earl of angus.
Who with his prince was more familiar
Nor of his grace had more auctorite
Was he not great wardeyn and chauncellar
Yet when he stood upon the highest gre
Trustyng no thing but perpetuite
Was suddenly deposed from his place
Forfayt and flemit, he gat non other grace
Wherefore trust not in auctorite
My dear brethren I pray you heartily
Presume not in your vain prosperity
Conferme your trust in god all holy
Syne, serve your prince with entier heart truly
And when ye se the court been at the best
I counsall you than draw you to your rest
Where been the hye tryumphant court of troy
Of Alexandre with his twelve prudent peers
Or Julius that right redoubted roy
Agamemnon most whorthy in his weres
To show their fine my frayed heart efferes
Some murdered were, some poisoned petiously
Their careful courtis disparsid dolefully
Trust well m^ friends there is no constant court but one
Where Christ is king whose time interminable
And high tryumphant glory is never gone
That quiet court mirthful and vmmutable
Without varyaunce standith ay ferme and stable
Dissimilance flatery nor falls report
In to that court shall never get resort
Trust well my friends this is no feigned fare
For who that been in the extreme of deed
The verite without doubt they should declare.
Without regard to favor or to feed
While ye have time dear brether make remede
Adue for ever, of me ye get no more
Besekand god to bring you to his glore
Adue Edinburgh, you high triumphant town
Within whose bounds right blythfull have I been
Of true merchants the rote of this regiowne
Most ready to receive court king and queen
Thy polecye and justice may be seen
Were devotion wisdom and honest
And credence tint, they might be found in the
Adue fair Snadowne, with thy toures hye
Thy chapel, ryall, park, and table round
May, June, and July, would I dwell in the
Were I a man to hear the birds sound
Whylke does again thy ryall rock redounde
Adue Lythko, whose palayse of pleasaunce
Might be a patron in Portingale or France
Farewell Falklande, the forteres of of Fyfe
Thy polyte park under the lowmonde law
Sometime in the, I led a lusty life
The follow dear to se them reke on raw
Court men to come to the, they stand great awe
Saying thy burgh ben of all burrowes vale
Because in the they never get good ale
Here begins the commonynge betwyxte the Papingo and her Executours.
THe pie p^rceyued the Papingo in pain
^ed down and feyned him to great
Sister said he alas who has you slain
I pray you make provision for your sprete
Go test your gere and you confess complete
I have power by your contrition
Of all your mysse to give you full remission
I am says he a channon regulare
And of my brether pryour pryncipall
My white rochet, my clean life does declare
The blake been of the death memorial
Wherefore I think your goods natural
Should be submytted hole in to my cure
Ye know I am a right holy creature
The rauin came raupand when he herd the rare
So did the gledde with money a petuous pew
And feynedly they counterfeyted great care
Sister said they, your retchlesnes we rue
Now best it is our just counsel ensew
Seeing we pretend till hye promotion
Religious men of great devotion
I am a blak monk said the rutland rauine
So said the gledde I am a cordilere
And has power to bring you quyk to heauin
It is well known my conscience been full clear
The blak bible prounce I shall perquere
So till our brether ye will give some good
God wate if we have need of lives food
The Papingo said fader be the rood
Howbeit your raiment be religious like
Your conscience I suspect be not good
I did perceive when preuely ye did pike
A chykyn from a hen under a dyke
I grant said he, that hen was my good friend
And I that chekyn took but for my teynde
Ye know the says by us men be susteynde
So by the kyrk it is preordinate
That sprituall men should live upon their teynde
But well wot I ye been predestinate
In your extreme to be so fortunate
To have syk holy consultation
Wherefore we make you exhortation
Sen dame nature has granted you syk grace
Leisure to make confession general
Show forth your sin in haste whill ye have space
Then of your gere make a memorial
When three shall make your feestes funeral
And with great bliss bury we shall your bones
Syne trentalles tuenty / trattle all at ones
The rukes shall rair that men shall on them rue
And cry commemoratio ammarum
We shall gar chyckens chepe, and geslynges pew
Suppose the gese and heanes shol^ cry alarm
And we shall serve secundum vsum Sarum
And make you safe we fy^d saint Blase to borgh
Cryand for you the careful corynogh
And we shall sing about your sepulture
Saint Mungoise matyns and the mekill creed
And syne devoutly say I you assure
The old placebo bakwart and the beed
And we shall were for you the mournyng weed
And though your sprete with Pluto were professed
Devoutly shall your dirige be adorest
Fader said she your facound words fair
Full sore I dreed be contrary to your deeds
The wives of the village cries with care
When they perseyue you move over their medes
Your falls consayt both ducke and drake sore dredes
I meruell shorthly ye be not ashamed
For your defaltes being so defamed.
It does aborre my pore perturbed spryte
To make till you any confession
I here men sayen ye be an ypocryte
Exempt from the syse and the session
To put my gere in your possession
That will I not so help me dame nature
Nor of my corpse I will you give no cure
But had I here the noble nyghtyngale
The gentle iaye* the merle / and turtour terwe
My obsequies and feestes funerale
Order they wo^d with notes of the new
The pleasand pan most angelik of hew
Would god I were with him this day confessed
And my deuyse duly by him addressed.
The mirthfull mauis with the gay gold spynke
The lusty lark would god they ware present
My infortune forsooth they would forthynke
And comfort me that is so impotent
The swyft swallow in practyk most prudent
I wot she would my bledyng stent belyue
With her most virtuous stone restringitiue
Count me the case under confession
The glede said proudly to the Papingo
And we shall swear by our profession
Counsel to keep and shaw it to no mo
We the beseke or thou depart us fro
Declare till us some cause reasonable
Why we been holden so abominable.
By thy travel thou have experience
First being bred in to the orient
Syne, by thy good service and diligence
To princes made here in the occident
Thou know the vulgar peoples judgment
Where thou transcurred the hot meridionale
Syne, next the pole the plage septentrionale
So by thy high ingyne superlatise
Of all countries thou know the qualityes
Wherefore I the conjure by god of life
The verite declare without in lies
What thou have herd be lands and by seis
Of us kyrk men both good and evil report
And how they judge shawe us we the exhort.
Fader said she I caytiue creature
Dare not presume with syk matter to mell
Of your cases ye know I have no cure
Demand them, wilk in prudence does precell
I may not pew my pains been so fell
And also perchance ye will not stand content
To know the vulgars peoples judgment
Yet will the death alyte withdraw his dart
All that lies in my memorial
I shall declare with true unfeigned heart
And first I say to you in general
The commone people says ye been all
Degenerate from your holy primitiuis
As testifyes the process of your liuis
Of your perelese prudent predecessors
The beginning I grant was very good
Appostles, martyrs, virgyns, and confessors
The sound of their excellent sanctitude
Was herd over all the world by land and flude
Planting the faith by predication
As Christ had made to them narration
To fortefy the faith they took no fere
Before princes prechyng full prudently
Of dolorous death they doubted not the dear
The verite declaryng fervently
And materdome they suffered patiently
They took no cure of land, riches, nor rent
Doctrine and deed ware both equiuolent
To show at length their works were great wunder
Their miracles they were so manifest
In name of Christ they heled many hunder
Raysyng the deed / and purging the possessed
With peruest spretes which had been oppressed
The crooked ran the blind men gate their eyes
The defe men herd, the lyppres were made cleen
The prelates spoused were with pouerte
The days when so they florysshed in fame
And with her companed lady chastity
And dame devotion notable of name
Humble they were semple and full of shame
Thus chastity and dame devotion
Was principal cause of their promotion.
Thus they continued in this life deuyne
Ay till there raygnyd in Romes great cite
A potent prince whose name was Constantyne
Perceived the kyrke had spoused pouerte
With good intent and moved of pite
Cause of dyuorse / he fand betwyxt them two
And parted them withouten words mo
Syne shortly with a great solempnite
Withouten any dispensacyon
The kyrke he spoused with dame properte
Whylke hastily by proclamacyon
To pouerte garte make narracyon
Under the pain of persynge of her eyne
That with the kyrke should no more be seen
Syluester that time was pape in Rome
Which first consented to the marriage
Of properte the whylke began to blome
Taking on her the cure with hye courage
Devotion drew her till an hermytage
When she considered lady properte
So high exalted in to dignite
O Syluester where was thy discrecyon
Whylk Peter did renounce, thou did recayf
Androwe and John^ did leave their possession
Their ships, their nets, lines, and all the layf
Of temporal substance nothing would they hayf
Contraryous to their contemplacyon
But soberly their sustentacyon
John^ the Baptyst went to the wilderness
Lazarus, Martha, and mary Magdalaine
Lefre heritage and goods more and less
Prudent saint Paul, thought properte prophaine
From town to town he ran in wind and rain
Upon his fete, techynge the word of grace
And never was subject to riches
The gled said yet I hear nothing but good
Proceed shortly and thy matter auaunce
The Papingo said fader by the rood
It were to lang to show the circumstaunce
How properte with her new alliance
Grew great with child as true men to me told
And bare two douthers goodly to behold
The eldest daughter named was riches
The second sister sensualite
Which did encreace within a short process
Preplesaunt to the spiritualite
In great substance and excellent beauty
These ladies two grew so within few years
That in the world ware none might be their peers
This ryall riches and lady sensual
From that time forth took hole the governance
Of the most part of the state spiritual
And they again with humble obseruaunce
Amorously their wits did auaunce
As true lovers their ladies for to please
God wot gyf than their hertes were at ease
Soon they forgate to study, pray, and preche
They grew so subject to dame sensual
And thought it but pain pore people for to teache
Yet they decreed in their great counsall
They would no more to marriage be thrall
Trusting surely to observe chastity
And albegyled quod sensualite
Apperandly they did expel their wives
That they might live at large without bondage
At liberte to lead their lusty lives
Thynkyng men thrall that been in marriage
For new faces provoke new courage
Thus chastity they turn in to delight
Wantyng of wives been cause of appetyte
The banyshyng of chastity.
Dame chastity did steal away for shame
From time she did perceive their puruyance
Dame sensual one letter gart proclaim
And her exiled Ytaly and France
In England could she get none ordinance
Than to the king and court of Scotland
She marked her wi^houten more demand
Trustyng in to that court to get comfort
She made her humble supplication
Shortly they said she should get no support
But boosted her with blasphemation
To priests go make you protestation
It is, said they, many an hundred year
Sen chastity had any enteres here
Tired for travel she to the priests past
And to the rulars of religyon
Of her presens shortly they were aghast
Saying they thought it but abusion
Her to receive so with conclusion
With one advise decreed and gave dome
They would receive no rebel out of Rome
Should we receive that Romans has refused
And banisshed England / Ytaly and France
For your flattery than were we well abused
Pass hens said they and fast your way auaunce
Among the nuns go seek your ordinance
For we have made oath of fidelite
To dame riches and sensualite
Than patiently she made progression
Toward the nuns with heart syghyng full sore
They gave her presens with procession
Received her with honor, laud, and glore
Purposyng to preserve her evermore
Of that nouelles came to dame properte
To riches and so to sensualite
Whylkes sped them at the post right spedely
And set one syege proudly about the place
The selly nuns did yield them hastily
And humbly of their gylt asked grace
Syne gave their bands of perpetual peace
Receyu and them they kept open wyckettes wide
Than chastity would no longer abide
So for refuge fast to the freres she fled
Which said they would of ladies take no cure
Where is she now than said the gredy gled
Not among you said she I you assure
I trust she been upon the burrow mure
By south Edynburgh and so full many menes
Professed among the systers of the senes
There has she found her mother pouerte
And devotion her own sister cordial
There has she found faith, hoope, and charity
Together which the virtuous cardinal
There has she founden one covent yet vnthrall
To Sensualite nor with riches abused
So quietly those ladies been inclused.
The pyote said, I dreed, be they assailed
They will render them as did the holy nuns
Doubt not said she for they been so artayled
They purpose to defend them with their gunnes
Ready to shote they have six great cannouns
Perseverance, constance, and conscience,
Austerite, labor, and abstinence
Till resist, subtle Sensualite
Strongly they been armed feet and hands
By abstinence, and keeps pouerte
Contrary riches and all her false seruandes
They have one bumbard brased up in bands
To keep their port in mids of their close
Whilk is called domine custodinos.
Within whose shote, there dare no enemies
Approach their place, for dreed of dyntes doure
But night and day, they warke like besy bees
For their defense reddy to stand in stoure
And has syk watchis on their utter toure
That Sensualite with siege dare not assail
Nor come within the shot of their artayle
The pyote said whereto should they presume
For to resyst sweet sensualite
Or dame riches which rulers been in Rome
Are they more constant in their qualite
Than the captayns of the spiritualte
Whylkes pleasandly withouten obstakle
Has them reseyued in their habitakle.
How long trow ye, those ladies shall remain
So solitary in such perfection
The Papingo said brether in certain
So long as they obey correction
Chosyng their heedes by election
Unthrall to riches or to properte
But as requires their necessite
O prudent prelates where was your prescience
That took on hand till observe chastity
Without austere life / labor / and abstinence
Perseyued ye not the great prosperity
Apperandly till come of properte
Ye knew good chere, great ease, and ydelnes
To lechery was mother and maystres
Thou raues vnroked the rauyn said by the roode
For to repreue riches or properte
Abraham and Isaac / were rich and ay good
Jacob and Joseph had prosperity
The Papingo said, that is verite
Riches I grant is not to be refused
Prouydyng always it be not abused.
Than made the raven a replicacion
Syne, said thy reason is not worth a myte
As I shall prove with protestacyon
That no man take my words in despyte
I say the temporal princes has the wit
That in the kyrk syk pastors does drouyde
To govern souls that not them self can guide
Long time after the kyrke took properte
The prelates lived in great perfection
Unthrall to riches or Sensualite
Under the holy spretes protection
Orderly choosing by election
As Gregore, Jerome, Ambrose, and Angustyne
Benedict, Bernard, Clement, Clete, and Line
Syk pacient prelates entered by the port
Pleasynge the pepole by predication
Now dyke lowpers, does in the kyrk resort
By symonye and supplicacyon
Of patrons by their presentacyon
So sely souls that been Christ's sheep
Are given to hungry gormond wolves to keep
No marvel is though we religious men
Degenerat be and in our lives confused
But sing and drink, none other craft we ken
Our spiritual faders has us so abused
Again our will they trukours been intrused
Lay men has now religious men in cures
Professed virgyns in keeping of strong hures
Princes princes, where been your hye prudence
In disposition of your benefyces
The guerdonyng of your courticience
Is some cause of your great enormiteis
There is one sort waytand like hungry fleis
For spiritual cure though they be nothing able
Whose gredy thrystes been insaciable
Princes I pray you be no more abused
To virtuous men having so small regard
Why should virtue through flattery be refused
That men for cunnyng can get no reward
Alas that ever a braggar or a barde
An hoore master or a common hasature
Should in the kyrk get any kind of cure
Were I a man worthy to were a crown
Ay when there vaked any benefyse
I should gar call a congregation
Of principals of all the prelacyse
Most cunnyng clerks of vniuersyties
Most famous faders of religion
With their advise make disposition
I should dispone all offices pastorayles
Till doctors of divinity or iure
And cause dame virtue pull up all her sails
When cunnyng men had in the kyrk most cure
Garlordes send their sons I you assure
To seek science and famous schools frequent
Syne, them promote that were most sapient
Great pleasure were to here a bishop preche
A deane, or a doctor in divinity
An abbot whylk couth well his covent teache
A parsone flowyng in philosophy
I tyne my time till wyshe whylk will not be,
Were not the prechyng of certain beggyng freres
Tint were the faith amange the seculeres.
As for their prechyng quod the Papingo
I them excuse for why they been so thrall
Till properte and her dygne daughters two
Dame riches and fair lady sensual
They may not use no pastyme spiritual
And in their hahytes they take syk delight
They have renounsed russat and course white
Clekande to them scarlot and cramosie
With meneuer / martrik / greece, and rich armyne
Their low hertes exalted are so hye
To se their papal pomp it is a pyne
More rich arraye is now with frenges fine
Upon the braudryng of a bysshopes mule
Nor ever had Paul or Peter again you will
Seeing fair ladies their cheyne may not escape
Sensualite so such seed has in them sawne
Less skathe it were with license of the Pape
That ylk prelate a wife had of his own
Then se their bastardes throughout the country blawne
For as soon as they be common from the scules
They fall to work as they were common bules
Pew quod the gled thou preches all in vain
The secular folk has of our cases no cures
I grant quod she yet men will speak again
How ye have made an hundredth thousand hures
Whylkes never had been were not your lychorus lures
And gyf I lie hertely I me repent
Was never byrd I wot more penitent
Than she shroue her with devout countenance
To that false gled wylk feyned him a friar
And after he had enjoined her penance
Full subtelly at her he began inquere
Chose you said he, whylk of us brethren here
Shall have of all your natural gere the cures
Ye know none been more holy creatures
I am content quod the pore Papingo
That ye friar gled and corby monk your brother
Have cure of all my goods and no mo
Seeing at this time frendsshyp I find none other
We will be to you as true as till our mother
Quod they and swear to fulfill her intent
Of that said she I take an instrument
The pyote said what shall my office be
Ouerseer said she unto the other two
She rowpand rauyn said sweet sister lat se
Your hole intent for it is time to go
The gredy gled said brother do not so
We will remain and holden up her heed
And never depart from her till she be deed
The Papingo them thanked tenderly
And said seeing ye have taken on you this cure
Depart my natural goods equally
That ever I had or has of dame nature
First to the howlot indegent and pure
Whilk on the day for shame dare not be seen
Till her I leave my gay galbert of grene
My bright depured eyes as cristall clear
Unto the bak ye shall them both present
In Phoebus presens whylk dare not appear
Of natural sight she is so impotent
My burneshed beik I leave with good intent
Unto the gentill petuous pellicane
Till help to perse her tender heart in twane
I leave the golk whylk has no song but one
My musyk with my voice angelical
And to the guse ye give when I am gone
My eloquence and tongue rethoricall
And take and dry my bones great and small
Syne, close them in a case of euour fine
And them present unto the fenix shine
To burn with her when she her life renewes
In Arabie ye shall her find without fere
And shall know her by her most heavenly hewes
Gold, asure, gowles, purpour, and sinopere
Her date is for to live five hundredth year
Make to that bird my commendation
And als I make you supplication
Seeing of my corpse I have you given the cure
Ye speed you to the court without tarying
And take my heart of perfyte portrature
And it prent unto my sovereign king
I wot he will it close in to a ryng
Commend me to his grace I you exhort
And of my passion make him true report
Ye three my trypes shall have for your travel
With liver and lunge to part equal among you
Prayand Pluto the potent prince of hell
Gyf ye fail that in his fete he fang you
Be to me true though I nothing belang you
Sore I suspect your conscience be to large
Doubt not said they we take it with the charge
Adue brether quod the pore Papingo
To talkyng more I have no time to tarry
But sen my sprete mon from my body go
I recommende it to the queen of fary
Eternally in to her court to tarry
In wyldernes among thyr holtes hoar
Than she included her heed and spoke no more
Plunged in till her mortal passion
Full grievously she grypped to the ground
It were to long to make narracyon
Of syghes sore with many stauke and stounde
Out of her wound the blood so abound
A compace round was with her blood made reed
Without remedy there was nothing but deed
And by she had in manus tuas said
Extincted were her natural wits five
Her heed full softly on her shulder she laid
Syne yield the sprete with pains pungitiue
The raven begane rudely to roug and ryue
Full gormondlyk, his empty throat he fed
Gate softly brether said the gredy gled
While she is hot depart her even among us
Take you one half and reke to me another
In till our right I wot no wight dare wrang us
The piot said the find receive the sother
Why make ye me stepharne and I your brother
Ye do me wrang syrgled I shrow your heart
Take there said he the puddynges for thy part
Than wot ye well my heart was wonder sayre
For to behold that dolent departing
Her angel fedders fleyng in the air
Except the heart was left of her nothing
The piot said this perteynes to the king
Whylk till his grace I purpose to present
Thou quod the gled shall fayll of thyn intent
The rauyn said, god nor I rax in a rape
And thou get this other to king or duke
The piot said plain I not to the pape
Than in one smedy I be smored with smuke
With that the gled the piece caught in his cluke
And fled his way the layfe with all their might
Till chase the gled flew all out of my sight
Now have ye herd this little tragedye
The sore complaynt, the testament and myschaunce
Of this poor bird, whylke did ascend so hye
Besekyng you excuse mine ignorance
And rude endyte, whylk is not to auaunce
And to the queyre I give the commandment
Make no repair, where poets been present
Because you been but rethoryk so rude
Be never seen beside none other book
With king nor queen, with lord nor man of good
With cote unclean, claim kynred to some coke
Stele in a nuke, when men list on the look
For smell of smuke men will abhor to bear the
Here I mensuer the, wherefore to lurk go lere the.
Here ends the complaynt, and testament of the king of Scotts Papinpo,
compyled by David Lyndesay of the mount, and finysshed the.xiiij. day of
Decembre, in the year of our lord. 1530
Imprynted at London in Fletestrete, at the sign of the Son, by John^
