TO HIS WORTHY Friend M. THOMAS SMITH of Clarkenwell, and Gentleman to the
Right Honorable the Lord LISLE, Lord Chamberlane to the Queens most Excellent
Majesty.
GEntle Sir, to rippe up the excellent parts abiding in you, might be reputed
Parasiticall by many, and offensive to you, whom I know no whit vain glorious:
to disclose your kindnesle toward my weak deserving, would be acounted
folly: that I could not receive a benefit, but make all the world acquainted
therewith: to desire you secure this poor infant of my brain with your
favor, as with Ajax shield were too trite an imitation, an apes trick:
therefore leaving fawning to flatterers, and offense to him that minds it:
bequeathing folly to such, as will not keep their own council and imitation
to them that cannot invent, I do plainly present this part of my love unto
you.

Your ever loving W. M.

To the Reader.
GOod Fortune to you, for the Fortune Tellers means so, whatsoever you think:
if his attendant Opinion decipher you plainly, his fashion is not to make
fair figures of deformed bodies: if his Page Mockso gibe at your ill manners,
it is to make you mend them, and if he himself the principal cutteth you to
the quick, know that he is no cogging Surgeon: what false Orthographie
escapes in the print, impute to the have of the suprauisor of the proofs (for
I have read the spelling book), what blame you put in the penning, lay upon
me, it will make me wiser.

THE MAN IN THE MOON, TELLING Strange Fortunes. OR, THE ENGLISH FORTVNE-TELLER.
Traveling a long journey, and striving one day beyond my reach, the sudden
approach of the night prevented me, so that being unexperienced in the way, and
seeing no reasonable creature to direct me, I was affrighted: The stars
stared upon me, beasts looked wistly after me, battes flew about mine ears,
and the owl whooted over mine head: no plow-men whistling along the
fallowes: no shepherd singing over the downs: the Partrage was not diseased
by the Spaniell: the Hare stole his food without fear of the hue and cry of
Hounds and hunters: whistnesse had taken possession of the woods, stilnes made
abode in the fields, and darkness domineered in the Zodiac, no light had I
to see my footsteps: no voice heard I to make unto: thus I wandered I knew not
where, came to a place, I knew not whether, and had a glimsse of one sitting in
a porch, I knew not whom. A while I stood a loose, leaning on my staff like a
wearied Pilgrim, and meditated with myself, whether fortunately, or unhappily
I stumbled thither; by the sollitarinesse of the house I judged it a Lodge in a
Forest, but there was no bawling of dogs thereabout; by the multiplicity of
barnes, I thought it some Farmers tenement, but there was no grunting of swine
near it: by the moate about, it seemed some Gentleman's Manor, but I could
epsy no Wagges watching, nor wantons wagging out, to breath themselves when
their Maddam was covered: what it was, after I had eaten a little heart a
grass, which grew at my feet, I feared not, and who was the owner, I greatly
cared not: but boldly accosted him, and desired house-roome: he pried in my
face, took me by the hand, led me into his house, placed me in a chair by
the fire, and without any intergatories, saluted me courteously, and went into
an other room; strange it was, and struck me in some dumpes, but considering
his gentle action and gravity, I a little revived: for he was of years many,
of stature reasonable, of complexion sanguine, no pride in his apparel, no
sullenness in his looks, silence sat in his hall, and sobriety in his
butteries, temperance in his kitchen, and chastity in his chambers, no
scoulding with his Cooks, nor carrousing with his Seruingmen: This I observed,
and sat very sadly, till a strip in requested me to follow him, where the old
man sat at a table furnished, not superfluously, but with sufficient
nourishment; down he bad me sit and welcome, Grace he said (then thought I,
there is no fear in this place, if there be grace) that which stood before me
I fed on, and drank when need required: being well refreshed, as he began
with thanksgiving, so he ended supper, and then said thus soberly unto me:
Son you might marvel at your entertainment, and repute me mute or simple
to use no more words nor circumstances at my first view of you, but it is my
fashion, as they which know me, know. For suppose I should ask you, what you
are? A stranger I know you are, and being a stranger unto me, you may say as
well what you are not, as what you are: had I demanded whence you came or
whither you would, for the one you might have told me a contrary tale, and for
the other your self is uncertain: from what parentage you are descended, I
might question you, it is frivolous and womanish, if your qualities be
degenerate: how you were educated, I might examine you, it is superfluous, your
demeanor will inform me: fall to your meat, I might have bidden you, it is
needless if you had a stomach: drink to you I might; it may be I desire no
further acquaintance of you, till I know your conditions further: but
howsoever if you be my friend, to use you unkindly, were ingratitude: are you
mine enemy? to use you friendly is charity: if you are capable, you do
understand my meaning, and shall know more ere we part: if you are ignorant,
you may taste part of my mind by the meat drink and lodging I bestow gratis
upon you. This is short and sensible, thought I, and made him this answer in
his own Dialect: Sir, if I could not gratify your kindness with loving
words, you might deem me rusticall: if I should not labor to repay your love
with my kindest requital, you might esteem me unthankful: but seeing I
cannot instantly perform the one, I will remain your debtor in very deed,
and in one word, heartily thank you for this unexpected courtesy, and
howsoever I may seem rude and illiterate, yet was I long trained up where good
manners grew, and learning flourished. I was once my self a lover of the Muses
too (said he) but I had a running head, and would take no settled course, many
countries have I traveled, and beheld sundry manners, but when age began to
tame, that never otherwise suppressable, indomitam iuuentutem, I pent my self
in this house, where I have long time been resident: much preferment might I
have mounted to, but I knew it troublesome, plus aloes quam mellis habens:
choice of wives I might have made, but by the trial of others, I perceived
them but mala necessaria, inconvenient commodities: great riches could I have
gathered, but I found them fuller of perturbations then pleasures: if I might
live always, perchance then I should make me a Tabernacle upon earth, but
considering how small a time I have allotted in the earth, I respected riches
as the Sand I trample on, rejected honor as a bubble, a puff of wind, vocem
populi, a mere sound: and weighed women as lightly as feathers. No my son,
that which God has bestowed upon me I am contented withal. If I am now base,
my grief is the less: I was never better, if I am poor, my sorrow is the
fuisse faelicem, I was neuerricher: yet have I that with suffices nature, and
this is my greatest grief, because I have separated my self from the world,
and labor to help such as want, and will take pains to come to me, aut
consolundo aut consi^io aut re I am accounted amongst the silly a cunning man,
a South-sayer, or Diuiner, one that can tell fortunes.

Somnia terrores magicos micacula sagus Nocturnos lemures portentaque Thessali
pideus Hor.
Believe me sir (said I) it is so bruted here about, and that to morrow many
will resort unto you, to know their fortunes, whereof I was one, not with
purpose to know my fortune, for I think it proper only to the Omnipotent.

You say well, and it is my affliction that they should attribute that to me
which pertains to my Maker: yet since I am constrained I will show them their
fortunes, and what will betide them every one: but now seeing it waxes late
and you weary, I refer you to your rest for this part of the night, and in
the morning you shall hear more. Kindly we parted, and the next day when I was
up and ready, I found the old man seated in a chair: who willed me to take my
place as a spectator.

He sat very soberly like Hypocrates, his beard was reverent and his face
wrinckled, a plain gown girded close about his loyues, a pair of black
buskins upon his legs, a fur'd night cap on his head, and a pair of thick
mittens upon his hands: on his left side stood a pert Iuuinall, as ready to
give the welcome to all comers, as a boy in a bar, and as nimble as a
parasite in an old commodie: he was called Mockso, which in mocking sort
described unto Fido the fantasticallity of each man's apparel, and apishnesse
of gesture, who by their apparel and gesture would give a shrewd guess at
their inclinations.

On the right side stood another, but of riper years, and more stayed
carriage, yet some what critical and taunting: he Cognominated him Opinion,
whom he had so thoroughly instructed in Phisiognomie, that he would anotonize
any ones condition at the first sight, and so apparently display them, that
Fido his Master wou,d tell what would betide them: thus were these three
addressed as actors:

Mockso, Described the habit and gesture.

Opinion, Reueiled their conditions.

Fido, Told every man his fortune, as he came unto him, for the same intent:
long had they not stayed, but one knocked at the gate, as if he meant to burst
it open: see who is there, said Fido, Mockso skipped to the door, giving every
one the faelicem aduentum, and returned, saying:

The description of the Drunkard coming in a merry humor to know his Fortune
by Mockso.
Sir, I may be glad I had never a beard, he would have singed it with his
flaming nose, whatsoever he be, he is troubled with an horses disease, the
staggers, I think your pales anger him, he does iustle them on both sides:
Oak he says they are made of, and spitteth whole pottels against them; Eheu
quid faciam? What an hue is his face of? and his teeth as nastie as if they
lay in a grave these seven years: his cloak will never hide his knauerie it
is so tottered, and his breeches will shame all, if he take wide strides: he
has no hat-band nor girdle, they lie in trouble for two Cannes: now he sets
his hat on the toe side, and comes sailing in like a ship in a tempestuous
tide.

The opinion of the Drunkard.
THis fellow is one of the faithful (as they prophanelie term him) (said
Opinion) no Heliogabalus at meat, but he will drink many degrees beyond a
Dutchman: if you love him pledge that health, and if you be a good fellow, make
no more such snuffes: his kingdom is an Alehouse, and his Scepter a Can, which
is seldom out of his hand: You queanes or knaves he cries, no attendance upon
gentlemen here, though he be but a Tinker: fill us the other dozen, it is but
taking Ludgate one year sooner: then he flingeth the glasses against the
walls, as if they cost nothing: and daunceth a round about a Can, as if it were
a Maypole: then he does driuell h s Hostess, and will dally with any that
wears a Crosse-cloth: then he cares not for a dear year, nor to pay his
Landlord, but all that he can get or borrow goes to the pot: To be brief
with him, he is his Masters hinderance, if he be a servant: his servants
torment, if he be a Master: his wifes cross, if he be an husband: his
childrens beggering, if he be a father: his own ruin, whatsoever he is, a
detested drunkard.

Fido. The Fortune Tellers Oration to the Drunkard, wherein he tells him his
Fortune.
TRue is the Proverb, though fustie to fine wits, when the drink is in, the
wit is out: but seeing you have set a broach the drink, and drawn out all the
dregs too, we may gather the wit is in: the vice you are so addicted to, is
drunkenness, the mother of all Mischief, the fuel of Filthiness, the root
of Rogeries, the distemperance of the Head, the subversion of the Senses, the
ship-wracke of Honesty, the loss of time, and voluntary madness, an
ignominious languor, the detestation of manners, the disgrace of life: abhorred
of God, detested of Angels, derided of men. Yet although it be thus horribly
detestable and ridiculous to God, Angels, and men, though it be thus
prejudicial to your soul, body, and substance: yet were it a more easy matter
to draw Hercules his club out of his hand, then to drive you or any of your
crew, from this filthy sin: but you would turn like the dog to his
vomit, let me or any other persuade you as we can: and that which causes me
to be thus opinioned you are so delighted therewith, that you prefer the
pleasure thereof, before all other preferment: and now I think of it, I
remember a pretty tale not impertinent to the same purpose. A Gentleman of
good worth, as he was riding along the high way, met a sturdie fellow, who
requested his alms: the Gentleman replied, that it was shame for him to beg,
being young and lusty, he was able to work, or fit to serve, if he were in
apparel: True Sir said the beggar, but apparel is not so easily gotten, by
such a poor man as my self: go home with me said the Gentleman, and I will
suite thee new, and thou shall wait upon me: Sir, answered the beggar, I
have a good suite of apparel in the next village, which lies not for above
eight-pence, if you will help me to that first, I shall think my self
beholding unto you, and will tell you more: the Gentleman rid, as he led him:
who brought him to an alehouse, and request him to alight, and enter with him:
the Gentleman was contented and sat down, expecting when he would call for his
apparel, that he might redeem it, and take him along with him: the beggar
called to his Hostess, saying: Hostess bring hither my Shirt, she brought
him a black pot of ale which he drank off: now said he bring me my Dublet, then
she brought him another pot of Ale which he drank off: now my breeches,
another pot she brought him, that he drank off: now bring my hose and shoes,
then she brought him two black pots of Ale, those he drank off, now my hat
band and cloak, then she brought him three black pots of Ale, which he drank
off: when he had done this, he said, Gentleman, this is the suite I told you
off, and now I have it, I think I am as well apparelled as an Emperor: the
Gentleman smiling, paid for this ale, and departed: so some of you might it
advantage them never so much, will never forsake their drunkenness: The
Dunkards Fortune.
this therefore is your fortune you shall spend all your money and run so
long on the score that the very wind pipe of your credit shall be so choat,
that if you do not drink it out with ready pay, your hostess will kick you
out of her doors: your wife will wish you in your grave, your friends be
ashamed of you, your enemies triumph over you: sober men shall shun your
company, boys laugh at you as you pass by them: your body shall be subject
to diseases: you shall live with never a penie in your purse, never a totter on
your back, no man will commit any matter of trust or secrecy unto you, and in
fine you shall lie and die in some ditch, under some staule or in some prison:
if you like your fortune, proceed as you have hither too: but if you abandon
it, better fortune will betide you: the drunkard began to come prettily well to
himself and walked somewhat soberlie aside: and then Mockso whipped to the gate.

The Tobackonist comes in a Brauado to the Fortune Tellers: Mockso describes
him as he approached.
WHo is that, said Fido? Sir quoth Mockso I know not certainly, but I think
he comes to play you a fit of mirth, for I beheld pipes in his pockette,
Now he draws forth his Tinder-boxe and his touch-wood, and falls to his
tacklings: sure his throat is on fire, the smoke flies so fast from his
mouth: bless his beard with a bazen of water least he burn it: some terrible
thing he takes, it makes him pant and look pale, and has an odious taste,
he spitteth so after it: A Boule and a Broom some body, if he holds on thus
long, he will make a puddle in your porch and keeps such a snuffing and
puffing, that he makes all smoke again.

Opinion of the Tobackonist.
O Have patience Mockso (said Opinion) he is at his breake-fast: it is his
heaven or rather hell: I should think it sends forth such mistes, fogges,
and vapors, five Chimnies well fewel'd vent not more smoke then his mouth and
nostrils: a man were better have his house situated between two Brew-houses,
then a but upon his Mansion: I had rather thrust my head into a Iakes, then
peep into his chamber. And nothing so noisome were it, to be yeoman to a
close stool, as to continue within forty foot of his breathing, yet is the
causer of these inconveniences, meat and drink to him, and he loves it above
the love of women: it is his mornings draught when he rises, his conserues or
cates, when he has well dined, his after noones nuncious, and when he goes to
bed, his posset smoking hot: he will not walk far, nor talk long
without it: nay he will loose his victuals rather then neglect it: pawn his
hat band but he will have it. To be brief with him, he is his own strengths
enfeebler, his beauties blemisher, his wits blunter, his memories decayer,
and his appetites abater. A toyish Tobackonist.

The Oration of Fido to the Tobackonist, showing his fortune.
SIr, said Fido, if I should extract the best counsel I could, being
disswasiue from your Tobacko-taking, you would take it in snuff, custom has
so strongly combined you thereunto, that it were too indissoluble a knot for me
to untie: yet this let me tell you, that it is as an incensed Atropos to a long
life, clipping off the thread before it be thoroughly spun, decaying and drying
up the prolonger of breath: but you are persuaded, as others few, that it does
procure the contrary: you think it a medicine for every malady; give you
Tobacko, and a fig for the Physician: say it were Physic, as you affirm,
yet Physic is not taken at al times and seasons, continually without Interim:
neither is one kind of Physic adminstred to all bodies, constitutions, and
diseases: but Tobacko may be compared to the potion which Circe gave to
Ulysses soldiers, metamorphosing them into swine: so this precious weed, as
you esteem it, does so selfe-besot those which take it, that like swine they
wallow in the mire of their admiring conceits: that neither reason can rule
them, nor experience of others harms sustained thereby, make them refrain. I
will not deny, that conceit may work wonders: but those wonders are only in
conceit, as I have heard of some, who through an irreformable conceit, have
imagined their noses to be as big as Pinnicles, to fly in the air, contend
and quell Devils by their own natural strength: so you, only by conceit,
think richly of the operation of your Indian Pudding, having contrary
qualities in it, a thing repugnant to Philosophy, and working miraculous
matters, a quillit above nature: as if you be fat, then you take it to make you
lean, (against the walls I hope you mean) if lean, then it will make you
fat, put V. and S. to fat and I will believe you: if dull, quick witted: if
obliuious, revive your memories, doing these things and many more; and helping
all manner of diseases, the pox it will as soon. But I could easily refute
these, and all your opinions, had not this text been thoroughly trauer'st and
condemned with great judgment and learning, Didimus wrote ten thousand books
of Grammar. Agrip. de vani. Scien.
in a solemn disputation; and in the book, entitled, Work for a Chimnie
sweeper: and were there as many volumnes written concerning this subject, as
Didimus wrote of the Grammar, you would martyr them, leaf by leaf, and light
your pipes at the flame: Nitimur in vetitum, that which wisdom does forbid
folly will follow. This therefore is your Fortune, if you leave not taking your
Indian stuff betime, custom will so confirm you to it, Vincere consuetudinem
dura est pugna.
that when you perceive the inconveniences, and feel the folly thereof, you
cannot forsake it, though you will: you shall die before your date: your body
shall be in subjection to sundry sickness, and so sooted with the smoke
thereof, that it will be as foul as hell, sending forth such a filthy sent,
that your breath will be death to your wife, or any that sent it, but such as
your self: Aside the Tobackonist stepped, and another knocked at the gate.

The Prodigal comes stalking in, to know his fortune, Mockso decyphering his
apparel and gate.
Who is that, said Fido?

Mockso answered: Sir I know not of what Country, Nation, Sex or fashion he
is, his face is like a man's: but by the tone side of his head like a woman:
some purblinde Barber powled him, to cut his hair so unequally, and leave one
lock a quarter of a yard longer then the other: by the block of his head (put
them both together, and see what they spell) he should be a Spaniard, but his
dublet shows him a Frenchman: now I see his breeches made like a pair of
Smiths Bellows, erected with the small end upwards: he seems a Walloone:
marry there is no excess in his cloak, he took the length thereof by the
old apes of Paris Garden: a sweet youth no doubt, for he has two Roses on his
shoes, to qualify the heat of his feet: he looks very bigly, and comes
prauncing in.

Opinion of the Prodigal.
THis Prauncer (said Opinion) has been a wild colt, and leaped thorough many
honest men's gates in his days: he was his fathers dotage, and his mothers
darling; he has spent more upon his paunch then the Primate of Belly gods:
gusted down his throat more then Cleopatra quaffed in a Brauado to Mark
Anthony: laid more gold upon his back, then that which procured passage for
the Ass into the Castle would defray: natural meat will not suffice him, he
feeds artificially: native apparel will not content him, he flies for
vplandish fashions: honest matrimony is not for his loins, he watches
nightly, and walks by day, to entrappe other men's wives: he is never safe,
but when he is in pestilent company: never well, but when he is evil
employed, Whores he supporteth, Vintners he aduanceth, Tailers he makes
Gentlemen, if he be not too far in their books: to be brief, he is
Lecheries Maecenas, idleness patron, Prides founder, Gluttonies erector,
Drunkenness good godfather: an impudent Prodigal.

The Fortune Tellers Oration to the Prodigal, declaring the inconveniences of
dissolute living, and his Fortune.
SIr, you are generously descended, Diuitiae, par^^tes, amici, etc. sunt vt
illius animus qui ea possidet, qui vti scit, ei bona, qui non recte vtitur mala.
the greater is your shame, to expose your self to an ignoble course of
living: much riches were you bequeathed, the more is the pity, you have so
little grace to misemploy them, well are you featured, it is ill bestowed
unless you would preserve your beauty better: for that which GOD and nature
have ordained for your good, by your ill using, you turn to your own
overthrow: had your progenitors run the race you do, they had never won
the Golden ball, which made you a Gentleman: you assume it an eminence, to be
rarely arrayed: others being wise, are not so conceited: you suppose it a great
glory to lash your coin, you care not where, nor upon whom; though they will
advance you, which receive benefit thereby, yet such as will not profit
themselves by such means, resemble you to a Candle, which wastes it self to
give other light: you esteem it an extraordinary happiness to be in favor
with many and sundry beauties, you shall feel the contrary, pride will
procure your fall, when you wot not of it: excess devour your riches, ere you
are aware: variety decay your body, when you think it does most delight it:
and when your body is decayed, your wealth devoured, your self fallen, go to
your Gossips, which now will hang like goodly jewels about your neck, and come
with your purse empty: stabis Homere for as, you may stand like an impecunious
Whore-master at their doors: come to your Tradsemen, which now cappe and
cringe you, and see if you shall receive any further comfort, then monefull
words, Alas, it is pity, would we were able (good wishes for themselves:)
and last of al, frequent the Ordinaries, which you have in a manner enriched,
and mark how they will moan their own mischances, how they sit at an
unmerciful rent: what losses they have sustained by pilfering; how many have
run away in their debts, and a thousand such circumstances, which you never
heard, nor are likely, so long as you have money or means.

Dum iuuet and ridet vultu fortuna sereno,
Indelibatas cuncta sequuntur opes:
At simul intonuit, fugiunt nec noscitur vlli,
Agminibus comitum qui modo cinctus erat.
Whilst you are mounted on the throne of fortune, great men will countenance
you, Gallants be your associates, Parasites flatter you, Brokers borrow for
you, Usurers lend you, Citizens cap you, Lawyers plead for you, Seruingmen
crouch to you, Wantons hang like Burres upon you: but when you are dejected
under the wheel of chance, great men will not greatly regard you, Gallants
hoist their tops and top Gallants, and sail from you, Flatterers shun you,
Brokers will not brook you, Usurers use you rigorously, Tradsemen tread on
the to side of the way, Lawyers leave you, Seruingmen hang the head as they
meet you, Wantons wish or work your overthrow. This therefore is your
Fortune, If you proceed as you have begun, your full feeding will make you
lean, your drinking too many healthes will take all health from you, your
leaping the pale will cause you look pale, your too close following the
fashion, will bring you out of all form and fashion, your careless life will
lead you to a miserable death: yet you may prevent your misfortunes, if now you
will take opportunity: you have some wealth left, husband it carefully: of a
little well ordered will rise more profit, then much carelessly disposed: yet
your wit is pregnant, by industry you may season it with wisdom: yet your
body is not past cure, newbred diseases are soon remedied: if you scoff at
me for my good will, you may repent when you lie like a nutmegge in a grate, or
ride post with a hempen halter out of the world: but if you accept it, much
good may it do you.

The Gallant very pensiuely walked aside, and Mockso went to the gate.

The Seruingman waiting on this Gallant, comes in to know his Fortune, whom
Mockso decyphereth.
Who is it, said Fido?

A most courteous creature, answered Mockso, So, stroke up your fore-toppe in
any case; pish, your band hangs right enough: what? yet more creuises in your
stockings: fie upon it, how complementall he is, and kisseth his hand as if he
were in love with it.

Opinion of the Seruingman.
THis fellow (said Opinion) though he be no drunkard, yet he is none of his
own man, he was a pretty boy, an handsome stripling, and is a proper man,
peevish in his childhood, proud in his youth, prodigal now in his best
years: he spends his portion in hope of preserment, wastes his substance in
liewe of advancement, consumes quite all in expectation of some requital; his
greatest felicity is to court the Chamber maids in a corner, and his chiefest
exercise to make his Masters friends dependants drunk; be fawneth upon them
his Master favors, and frumpeth those his Mistress frowns on: he was
trained up in some point of a Ioyners trade to make legs, and the best part
of his Rhetoric is I forsooth, and no forsooth: the injunctions he stands
bound too, is to run at all calls, rise at all hours, and ride in all
seasons: eating that which his Master left, and wearing that which his Master
left, if he can get it: which shows that he is the Ante-ambulo of a Gentle
woman, the consequent of a Gentleman, the antecedent of a Port-mantua or a
Cloke-bagge: A Seruingman.

Fidoes Oration to the Seruingman, teaching him briefly how to behave himself
in service, and telling him his Fortune.
Ungrateful and hard hearted are many of our age, respecting none but such as
profit and pleasure them at the instant: industrious therefore ought you be,
to get your Masters favor, and having gotten it, circumspect to keep the
same: and albeit some there are, respecting their services no longer then they
supply their lusts and lucre, thrusting them out of their gates unrewarded
for the smallest trifle and displeasure, conceived against them; yet the world
knows, and thousands will acknowledge the fluent liberality of true bred
Gentillity, extended to their followers: who by the raising hand of their Lords
assistance, have ascended many high and lofty steps of dignity: but such
Masters are not sown every where, neither were they swaggering drunkards, or
swearing Iackes, which have thus flourishingly sprowted up by service: but men
of good demeanor and well quallified: for the wise look not only on the out
sides, they pry into behavior, integrity and uprightness: It is not
profound quaffing or domineering will do you any good, roysting and ryoting
will never raise you (unless up to the Gallows.) This therefore is your
fortune, If you be in good service, and will not with care and diligence keep
you in it, when you would have the like again, you shall go without it: if
you take time you may thrive, but if you let him pass by, you may call your
heart out, and never reclaim him: for time though he be an old man, yet he
is quick of foot, and having gotten the start of any, is never ouer-taken: if
you gather nothing in the Summer of your youth, in the Winter of your age you
may go beg: for he that might do well and would not, when he wants
shall be vnpittied, and when you become old and poor too, then shall you be
spurned with the heel of disdain by every foote-boy: rejected as an old woman
which spent her youth wantonly, then shall you hear of your old vagaries,
your former follies shall be laid in your dish: if in your iollity you wronged
any, they will wait for revenge in the time of your want and weakness: when
the Lion was old and toothlesse, the Ass revenged an inueterate injury he
had sustained long before, but now you are in place, if you demean your self
honestly: now you are young preserve that you get carefully: now you are in
service, perform it faithfully: you may hereafter purchase much comfort, goods
and credit. So the creature followed his Master, and another knocked at the
gate.

The lewd woman comes to know her Fortune, whom Mockso describes entering.
WHo is that, said Fido?

One with a mask forsooth, because you may ask, (said Mockso) a woman of tall
stature and upright body (it is well if her life be like it) high forehead
round cheeks, dimpled chinne, sleeke neck, and slender waste, in a light
colored hat, light colored fan, light colored gown, though she were in the
dark, she would appear a light woman.

Opinion anatomizing the conditions of the wicked Woman.
O (Said Opinion) this is one of your lazy liquerous Lascivious feminine
ingenderers, more wavering then a Wethercocke, more wanton thenan Ape, more
wicked then an Infidel, the very sink of sensuality, and poole of
putrefaction: a Sylla to Citizens, and Caribdis to Country men: a comfort for
cut-purses, and a companion for conycatchers: a Factor for many Tauerns, and
Benefactor for most Barber-Surgeons: a palsy to the body, a canker to the
soul, a consumption to the purse: by birth commonly a Bastard, by nature a
Camball, by art a puritan: in aluring a Siren, in show a Saint, in deed a
Devil; and in plain English, a Whore: of all iniquities believe her not, for
she lives by lying: touch her not, for she is pitch, inquinans omnes qui
tangunt eam: proffer her nothing, for she will pocke eat al. And now sir she
appears in her lightness before you.

The Fortune Tellers Oration to the Mercinarie wicked woman, declaring the
abomination of her life and fortune.
Fair creature, as I have been effectually informed of your conditions: so
would I labor to reform them: but I might with as great hopes undertake to
make a black More white, as to change your mind, and easier raise an old Oak
from the earth with my decrepit shoulders, then root out that lust which has
so long time been set in your heart: yet if you would consider the
inconveniences thereof, which are, to effeminate the mind, weaken the body,
endanger the soul, it might prove a motive to dissuade: you would account your
self madd, if knowing poison to be blended in a lump of sugar: you should for
the sweetness of the sugar, swallowe the poison: what then can you make now of
your self, knowing lust a pleasant poison, hindering your health, ingendering
diseases, bringing age before his time, blemishing your beauty, ere it be out
of the blossom, dulling your wit before it be well grounded: and drawing your
mind from all virtuous cogitations, this you know for certainty, yet you will
live in sensuality disdaining Diana, and be a votarie to Venus: contemning
Vesta, and deuoting your self to quotidiall daliance: making a mock at
marriage, you will not enter into the bonds thereof, because you will live
loosely, without control or subjection of an husband: yet are you servile to
all slavery, and subject to the controlement of every swaggerer: he that has
money may command you: he that can dominere will insult over you, making you
crouch and curuet when he pleases: but if no warning will make you wise, this
then will be your fortune: You shall be ferrited like a Cony out of every
burrow, baited like a Bear, whipped like a Jade, long shall you not dare to
abide in one place, Authority will so closely pursue you: what you get in a
quarter, you shall spend in a month: nothing that you get will prosper with
you: and what beauty and delectation your body now contains, shall be of
small continuance, your hair which now is fast and thick, shall fall from your
head like leaves in Autumn: your forehead which now is smooth, shall soon be
wrinkled like parched parchment: your complexion which now is sanguine, shall
be of a saffron color, your cheeks thin, your nosethrils putrifactions,
your mouth toothlesse, your breath noisome, your flesh rotten, your bones
cankerous, your pleasure shall be turned into pain, your singing into sorrow:
Aches shall lodge in your head, anguish in your heart, diseases in every part
and parcel of your body: and after all these, thy soul suffer perpetual
torments. A side she walked, and Mockso without any knocking, skipped to the
door, for the Wagge imagined, she could not want companions or servants in
this age, so long as her good face lasted.

The retainer, which waited on the woman, enters to know his fortune, whom
Mockso describes as he enters.
IS there any other come (said Fido?) There is one coming, answered Mockso, he
will scarce see the way in, his hair hangs so in his light: Fatuus in facie,
and leno in corpore, He looks fat in the face, and lean in the body: how
full of choler he is? yet so long as those huge flops swagge about him, he will
be in some compass: his boots are wrinkled, as though they were made of old
wives faces: what capt on the toes? sure he will not put off one of those caps
to the best man that meets him, and in sober sadness his spurs have escaped
a scouring, they look so rustily, whatsoever he be, I think he would prove an
honest man, if he would wash his face and serve God.

Opinion upon the retainer.
Serve God (said Opinion) the devil he will as soon, he has not seen the
insides of a Church these seven years, unless with devotion to pick a pocket,
or pervert some honest man's wife, he would on purpose be pued with all:
villainy is his contemplation, ribaldrie his talk, and detestation his deeds,
Cards are his darlings, wherewith he plays, and a pair of Dice his only
Paradise: he will omit no villainy, he can cleanly commit, he will cheat his
father, cosen his mother, and cony-catch his own sister, if he can imagine the
means how: his own wife he will make a prostitute for money, and hold the
candle to any incarnate devil, whilst he commits the deeds of darkness
with her, six pence will make him swear or forswear any thing: in a word, he
is a Post for Puncks, an Harbinger for Whoremongers, a Blood-hound for Bawdes:
a perfidious Pander.

Fido his speech to the Pander, showing his lewdness and fortune.
O Lamentable, thy case is damnable, thy trade odious, thy self abominable,
thou art a man whose conditions I know not by experience, neither have I read
of many such as thy self in ancient Writers, yet some of thy sect there were,
of whom I took little notice, because I never meant to have any commerce with
them: notwithstanding, seeing I have heard so much, I could amply delate of thy
sin, but I know it needless, for my hope is, I have dejected the foundation,
whereon all thy practices are built, I mean the woman thy Mistress, which was
even now with me, and if she fall from her former folly, thou can not
stand, unless thou gettest some crooked prop to support thee, which cannot
hold long: expect therefore no other fortune, then untimely death, either by
the stab in some drunken fray, managed in the defense of your maintainer, or by
some disease got by her, or by the halter, if you do not alter: away the
Pander walked after his Mistress, and another knocked at the gate.

The extortioner hobleth to know his fortune, and is described by Mockso, as he
enters.
Who is that, said Fido, that comes next? Vetus, vietus, veternosus senex: a
wise man I Will warrant him, for he can keep him self warm: no friend to the
Barber it should seem, by his rusticall, over grown and vnfinified beard: his
gown is thoroughly foxt, yet he is sober, for he looks as though he quenched
his thirst with whay and water, rather then with wine and stout Beer, and his
Mandilion edged round about with the stigmaticall Latin word Fur; a ruff
about his neck, not like a Ruffian but inch broad, with small sets, as if a
piece of a Tobacco pipe had been his poking stick, his gloves are thrust under
his girdle, that you may see how he rings his fingers: bless his worship, now
he comes coughing in.

Opinion of the Extortioner coming to know his fortune.
HE is (said Opinion) miser qui nummos admiratur, miserable or an able miser,
which makes much of money, Gold is his God, and Silver his Saint, Bonds are
his Bibles, and Obligations his Horizons, Scriueners are his Priests, which do
his service, and consoning Brokers his Christian brethren. Security is his
secretary, and Sergeants his serving men: he lives by use, like a Bawd, and
deals deceitfully, like a cheating gamester: he is a rare Alchimist, which
from a little gold and silver will abstract a million in time: Better is a poor
Gentleman to fall into the paws of a Lion, then between his clutches, and may
with more safety escape the gripe of a she Bear, then to be released from his
leases: to be brief with him: he is an insatiable cormorant, or rather
corne-vorant, a bottomless Barathrum, a merciless mony-monger, a filthy forty
in the hundredth, an unconscionable Extortioner.

Fido his Oration to the Extortioner, displaying his damnable dealing, and
Fortune.
FAther, you are welcome, and without fear or flattery, I will breefely tell
you my mind: You have long traffickt in a wicked and unlawful trade, wicked I
call it, because it is repugnant to the laws of the highest enacter of all
decrees: unlawful I may avouch it, because I never knew nor heard of any good
law maintaining it: for the former, if you run over the book of books, you
shall find many fearful judgments denounced against you, and the latter you
cannot contradict it by no Country laws, which although they flatly deny
thee, to take above ten in the hundredth, a venial sin in respect of thy
capital and deadly offense: yet does it not authorize thee to take so much,
but taxes thee if thou vsurpest any more. But what should I talk of this
text, which has been thoroughly entreated of by better and more judicious then
my self? or why should I wast my breath to thee, which have neither faith,
hope nor charity? What do I talk of these things to thee, whom the love of
riches has so besotted, that it is impossible to divert it? or how should I
think to prevail by dissuading: Cum te neque feruidus aestus Dimoueat lucro,
neque hyemps, ignis, mare, ferru^: when neither the parching heat, nor
benumbing cold; neither fire, sword, nor sea, can dissuade: Impulit amentes,
aurique cupidine caecos,
Ire super gladios, super atque cadauera patrum.
Therefore if your future fortune (That is, Quis pauper? auarus Auson.
Semperinops qui cunque cupit. Clau.
that which shall light upon you hereafter, will not draw you from your daily
practicing the same, nothing will) which is this: You shall always want,
though you have never so much, semper auarus eget, Hor. though thou art a
Master, thou shall be always a servant, moyling for a mite, and watching to
save a penny; thou shall live in perpetual terror and fear, she that lies
in thy bosom shall make thee suspicious, least she steal from thee; they
which were begotten of thine own body, will scarre thee, least they rob
thee: all that look near the place, where thy gold lies, thou will be
jealous of, least they lurk to defeat thee of it: Non vxor saluum te vult,
non filius, omnes Vicini oderunt noti pu eri atque puellae: thy wife will wish
the hanged, thou keep her so barely; thy children pray for thine end, thou
maintainest them so basely; thy neighbors and kinsfolks speak broadly of
thee, thou use them so cruelly; and when thou art dead, Devils hurry thee to
perdition, wishes damn thee to everlasting torments, and cursses consort with
thy funeral: Nay thy wife shall be enamored of some spend-all, which shall
wast all as licentiously as thou have heaped together laboriously: thy children
never thrive with ought thou did bequeath them, it was so vilely gotten,
and thy name either utterly blotted out, or remain infamous to posterity. If
you like your fortune proceed, but if you mislike it, desist from your racking
and raising, your powling and pinching the poor: recompense them which you
have wronged, or at the least, injury none no more, but do good according to
the quantity of your goods, and so you may bring a blessing to your self and
posterity. The Extortioner walked aside, and another knocked at the gate.

The Glutton enters to know his fortune, whom Mockso decyphereth.
WHo is next, said Fido?

Monstrum horrendum inform ingens, A monstrous man (said Mockso) your gate is
too little for this Grecian horse, if you cause not part of your wall to be
plucked down, he cannot come in: God be thanked, he has the wit yet, to
enter f^^eling, like a Gentlewoman with an huge Farthingall: how he puffs and
blows like a short winded Hackney: now he approaches wallowing like a woman
with child: he might be an Ox for his ^oule, a Bull for his neck, a Cow for
his belly, and a Calfe for his wit, I make no question.

Opinion of the Glutton.
BOna verba Mockso, (said Opinion) he will hate you to death if he hear you
and work you a michiefe if you misuse him, he is a great man, I can tell you,
and in huge request amongst no small fools: Phago might be his grandfather,
for his full feeding, and Garagantua his Sire, for his gormand zing: he is none
of your ordinary fellows, which will suffice nature for three pence, give him
an Ox rost^d whith a pudding in his belly, a Rabbit is but a bitte with him,
and he will ^ranch ^apons as fast as a beggar will crack Lice. he is a tall man
at a table, and will toss a pike strenuously, if it be soaked in white-broth:
he is none of your great talkers, but will do pretty well at a dinner: if
silence be a virtue, he is a virtuous Gentleman, for at meat he cannot entend
to talk for eating, and between meals, he sleeps soundly: to be brief
with him, he is a pestilence to Pasties, which sweepeth many of them sheere
away, a consumption to capons, Chick^ns, and other poultry, a sepulcher to
Seafish, and others in ponds, moates, and Rivers, a sharp sheepe-biter, and a
marvelous Mutten-monger, a gorbelly Glutton.

Fido his Oration to the Glutton, inueying against his sin, and revealing his
fortune.
TAntum cibi and potionis adhibendum est, vt reficiantur vires, non vt
opprimantur: Sir, I salute you with this saying of Cicero, because I perceive
you ever ballace your belly, an ungrateful member, never thankefully repaying
that which is done unto it, but daily calling for more then is needful; and
why should man that has understanding to judge, and reason to rule, be so
servile to filthy appetite? a small thing will content nature, and satiety does
rather displease then pleasure her: it makes her unfit to perform any agill
or active thing: beside the overplus might tend to many profitable uses, but
you cannot fall too unless your table be fully furnished: how did they in the
old time, when they were sufficed with such sustenance as the Grass and trees
afforded; they lived longer, and were stronger then they of this instant; they
had no Cooks to provide them cates, hunger was their best sauce, labor and
exercise the Cooks, which composed that sauce, if you would feed with the like
sauce, composed by the same Cooks, it would take you a button lower, and cause
you look not like Boreas; as you now do: if not, I cannot remedy it, neither
will I speak to your deaf god Bell, or rather belly any longer: your
fortune will be this: many diseases will be ingendered in you, through your
immoderat eating: fit for no Country service will you be, neither in martial,
nor domestical affairs, a fool shall you live, and a dunce shall you die,
and that sooner too then otherwise you would, keeping a sparing and temperate
diet: all the pampering of your paunch shall be to no other purpose, for you
strive for all delicate creatures to feed your self, and you your self shall
be food for the worms. A way the glutton lagged, and Mockso highed to the
door, expecting that as he was larded, so he would be guarded with some or
other: for rich men have many friends, and need not walk alone unless they
please.

The Parasite associating the glutton to the gate, enters, Mockso describing
him.
Who is that (said Fido)? a finicall fellow, answered Mockso, as full of
salutations as a Fiddler, his Hat was off before I could ask him what he would,
and his knee licked the superficies of your threshold, ere I bad him enter, a
crafty fellow, I fear, he is so full of courtesy, and some cousoning
companion, he has such a flearing countenance: now he eieth you sir, his head
is bare, O rare, what an excellent dumb show is this? thrice has he kissed his
hand and made you three low congies in coming three strides: now he
approaches near you, I think he means to make a Pope of you, and kiss your
toes.

Opinion of the Parasite.
HE is none of your Cynicks, nor Critics, he is no Momus that snappeth Vice
by the shinnes, as she passes by him: he respects not what men be, so they
be rich, he will live, when they lack: he fleareth not in your face for nothing,
nor reflects his legs without some surmised reason, he will fawn on you like
a Spaniell, follow you like a foisting Hound for his commodity, say what you
will, he will swear to it, do what you delight in, he will encourage you: are
you adicted to drink drunk, he will gibe at sobriety, and christen her with
innumerable nicknames. Do you love whores? he will scratch where it itcheth
not, and tickle your ears with a tale of variable venerie: have you one spark
of goodness? he will extol you above measure; have you never so much ill? he
will mitigate it: he is in Tantologies of praising, that you like, and extreme
in discommending, that you do condemn, be it never so praise-worthie: he
gives nothing his due or proper right, but either too much or to little, he
cares not for the mean: he will pervert any thing for his purpose: if you be
a coward, he says you are wise and truly valerous: if prodigal, then
generouslie liberal: are you a niggard? then frugall and provident: is your
head great, a note of policy: is it little, the loftiest men are so marked: is
your nose long, an excellent ornament: he knew a great Lady that never
commended other: is it short, it is the comliest: are you high colored? it is
the soundest complexion: are you pale? it is amorous and attractiue: are you
tall? all that are lower then you, are dwarfes: are you low? all that are
taller, are lubbers or May-poles: to be brief with him: he will soothe you up
in any sin, hug any heinous humor in you foster any folly, wealthy
men's welwisher, pouerties deadly enemy, a false hearted fawning Parasite.

Fido his Oration to the Parasite, revealing his faults and fortune.
Sir (said Fido) since your disposition is so largely described, I shall not
need much to delate on it, but to speak freely and compendiously unto you, I
hold you to be the most venomous serpent, that crawleth in a commonwealth,
and would advise all men that tender their own safety to shun you, as an
Harpie, and stop their ears at your words, as the enchanting of Mermaydes:
Plus nocet lingua adulatoris, quam gladius persecutoris: your tongue does more
hurt then war or pestilence, and you are the causer of more mischief, then
any impiety whatsoever, lulling men in the sleep of security: whereas, if
they were kept waking, and had their faults laid apparently before them, no
doubt but that either shame or fear would work a reformation in them: guilty
therefore are you of all those crimes, which they commit, and accessarie to
their enormities, whom you secure and sooth up in follies: your fortune
therefore will be full foul in the end, and though you may flourish for a
time, and live in favor, yet when your assertions are found false, your
friendship fained, your counsel hurtful unto them, then you may give an
vltimum vale to your happiness; they which loved you will loath you to death,
they which credited you, will not believe you for a world, though then you
should tell them never so truly: they that graced you, will be the first that
shall publish your disgrace, and work your ruin: because like a traiterous
person you endeavored theirs, by your conceiling their follies, and animating
them to any villainy. Away the Parasite sneaked, and another knocked at the
gate.

The wanton wife enters to know her Fortune, whom Mockso describes.
WHo is that, said Fido? A sweet woman, no doubt answered Mockso, do you not
smell her? a cowling eye, she turns it with a trice, a fair hair, if it be
her own: an high forehead, if it be not forced: a rare face, if it be not
painted: a white neck, if it be not plastered: a straight back, if it be not
bolstered: a slender wast, if it be not pinched: a pretty foot, if it be not
in shooe-makers last: a fair and rare creature, if she be not dishonest.

Opinion of the wanton wife.
O Si fas dicere, She came naked into the City, and shall so return, unless
she do penance with a white sheet pinned about her, as she now deserneth her
husband married her for pure love, and had naught with her, and so he is
likely to have, so long as he has her: yet she will flaunt it with the
finest, and gadde abroad with the giddiest, looking for greater attendance then
an Empress, and more duty then a Duchess, envying all that are more bravely
trapped then her self, and confederate with few but such as are wantonly
intrapped, as she is: no fashion can be extant, but she must have a fling at
it: no sight to be seen, but she must view it: not a gewgaw to be heard of,
but she must have it; she will buy nothing that is cheap, wear nothing that
is common, eat nothing that is not costly: her honest husband is her
hobie-horse at home, and abroad her fool; amongst her copesmates, wanton
wenches game amongst themselves, and wagges sport to point at with two fingers:
who is so terrified by her, that he were better in his grave: by day he dare
not meet her, she is so manned with make-shift, by night he fears to lie with
her, her touch is so ambiguous: with meat he cannot please her, she is so
dainty, in clothes he cannot keep her, she is so costly, with words he cannot
fit her, she is so captious, in deed he cannot content her, for she is a
wanton: If he endeavor with good counsel to dissuade her, (she says) he
preaches too learnedly for her to edify, if he gybe and jest at her folly,
then he is all wit or a wittall, if he keeps her short of money, then she
rappeth out an oath, that she will have coin though she be hanged for it: if
he keep her close within doors, the next time he stirs out, Nupta virum
timeat, cas ta sit custodia nuptae.
a Sergeant clappeth him on the shoulder, for some debt she has entered
unknown to him, for such a purpose: Tum sua dominantur aula, Dulichii Samiique
etc. To be brief, she is her husbands affliction, her childrens disgrace, her
friends scandal, roysters and rake-hels randeuouce, a wanton wicked well
favored wife.

Fido his Oration to the wanton wife, detecting the heynousnesse of her beastly
life, and Fortune.
Were your mind as richly beautified as your body, you could not be too
highly prized; but seeing the beastliness of your behavior, blemisheth your
beauty: I cannot but condemn and contemn you: who having plighted your
faith, and solemnly obliged your self unto an husband, are now become most
faithless and perfidious, leaving the fruit which was allottted, you fall to
the forbidden tree: which driving you out of Paradise, will expose you to the
infamy of the world: if you can delude your husbands eyes with demure
carriage, and possess him with a good conceit thereof, then you care not how
you cosen him of his goods privily, deride him closely, abuse him behind his
back, so all be done Caute it is well done: but if you consider the cause
aright, it is your self you wrong: there is an eye which sees you, though
never so closely cabined, there is an ear that hears you, whisper you never
so softly: there is an heart which apprehends you, contriue you never so
cunningly: from which if you cannot conceal your thoughts, words and works,
never laugh in your sleeue, how you have gulled or bulled your husband: nay
many are so impudent they care not who know it, they think it a credit to be
notorious, an honor to have Gallants seek unto them: where carrion is it is
no marvel to find Kites: pleasure has an amiable face, but a loathsome body,
a sweet taste, but a sour digestion; a delicious life, but a miserable death:
look upon that plot in my Garden, you see it fresh and fragrant, if I should
permit many of my neighbors to fling their Garbidge on it, it would become a
fulsome dunghill: or behold my well, the water in it is clear and sweet, if
the sinkes here about should have passage to it, they would soon alter the
clearenesse and sweetness of the water: so now you are sound and lovely to
look on: you may maintain the same for a small space, but being common
ulcers, filth and blanches will breed upon you like frogs and toades in
stinking pooles: Dedit hanc contagio tabem, atque dabit plures sicut grex totus
in aruis, vnius scabie cadit and prurigine porci unaque contacta liuorem ducit
ab vna: Iun.
And therefore I cannot blame those which are timorous of their wives, for
their own bodies safety: one rotten sheep corrupts a flock: one measeled
Hoggesmites an Heard: one plagued person infects a people. Now to your Fortune,
If you once loose your good name, you will never recover it: if now in youth
you forsake your husband, and play false, in your age when none respect you, he
will reject you: your children may beg or steal, will he toil to maintain
other men's gettings? If he decease before you, no honest man will have you,
unless some of your deboshed companions, more for lucre then for love, who
will never trust you, knowing you false to your former husband: and then
perchance you would wish you had been more constant to your first betrothed,
and less confident to every cogging companion: but it will be then too late,
now lament your folly, and begin a new life, abandon lewd company, and
idleness, and you may have many a fair day, and future felicity: else expect
nothing but misery, shame, and many misfortunes in the end, which will fall
heavily upon you, if you do not now labor to prevent them. Away she walked,
and another rapped at the gate.

The jealous man enters to know his fortune, Mockso describing him.
Who is that, said Fido? One as melancholy as a Cat, answered Mockso, and
glared upon me, as if he would have looked through me: sure he lacks
something, he gazeth so about him: hold not down thine head for shame, like a
beast: but erect thy countenance, like a man. High-ho how he sigheth, and
beats his breast, as if there were something there angering him: Why does he
feel his forehead so often, it is smooth enough, he doubts (I lay my life)
they will sprowt out shortly, and shall soon become as huge headed as was
Acteon, after he gazed on the Goddess bathing her self with her Nymphs in
the Fountain.

Opinion of the jealous man.
HE is more afraid then hurt (said Opinion) he macerateth his mind without
cause, and troubles his thoughts without true reason: his wife is fair,
therefore he thinks her false: of a witty disposition, therefore he
deemeth her a wagge-taile: all that speak to her, he thinks woo her, and
every man that looks on her, he judges loves her: let her speak him fair,
then she faigneth, let her use him dutifully, then she does counterfeit: if she
keeps home, it is volens nolens against her will: let her go abroad, then his
head aketh, and his heart pants: is she neatly arraied, that is but to
allure and please others: is she homely dressed, she knows he will keep house
that day: go they in the streets together, if she glanceth but a side, he
knows her mind forsooth: courtesy in her, is the loadstone of her lust: and
affability the cunning Orator for her concupiscence: brings he any to his
table, if she carue them, it is in hope of some amorous requital: if she
drink to them, their pledgings are but as pledges of their concealed loves:
they which proffer him kindness, he surmiseth it pretended for opportunity to
his wife: and they which frequent his house, be they of his nearest alliance or
kindred, he suspecteth: to be brief with him, she is his fortunes
fore-staller, his minds misery, his bodies bane, a reiecter of his most
intimate familiers, a suspicious ill liver (for the wife would never have
sought her daughter in the Oven, unless she her self had been there in
former times) an erroneous heretic in the opinion of his wife, an
unreasonable and causeless jealous man.

The Fortune Tellers Oration to the jealous man, declaring his folly and
fortune.
SIr, of all men, I hold you most senseless, who without certain grownd and
sure experience should misconceit, that which was never meant you: cannot your
wife be fair, but lascivious? what say you to Lucretia? can you not be absent?
but she will play foul? how think you of Penelope? who in the ten years
absence of her husband, lined chaste and untouched: but suppose that which you
suspect, were certain: sores past cure are past care: Quod factum est,
infectum esse nequit: that which is done cannot be undone: that which will be
shall be: if she be chaste and virtuous, no beauty can tempt her, no gifts
allure her, no persuasions win her: but if she be disloyal, keep her never
so close, she will sometime or other fly out in despite of you.

Vt iam seruaris been corpus adultera men's est
Nec custodiri, ni velit ipsa potest.
Centum front oculos centum Ceruice gerebat: Argus and hos vnus saepe fefellit
amor. Ovid.
When Jupiter loved Io, a delicious Damsel, his wife being mistrustfull, dogged
him, to find out his dealing: who to conceal his fault, turned the Lady into
an Haifer, which Juno begged, and resigned to the custody of Argus, who
although he was feigned to have an hundred eyes: yet was he beguiled of the
jewel he watched so narrowly: so be you never so vigilant and circumspect, if
she be so disposed, she will, Non caret effectu quod voluere duo: needless
therefore will your care be if you have no cause: and although you have good
reason of none effect, Naturam expellas furca, licet vsque recurret: Now to
your fortune: if you be obstinate in your belief, and so confirm in your
false faith, you will martyr your self most miserably, your body will be soon
wasted, and your substance consumed, because when your thoughts are destracted
with such frivolous matters, you can never seriously negociate your
estate-concerning, and supporting designs, your best way therefore, is to
think the best, judge the best, et modo te sanum fingito, sanus eris: away the
jealous man departed, and an other knocked at the gate.

The Lover entering to know his fortune, Mockso describes him.
Who is that said Fido? I know not, said Mockso, but he looks very
pitifully upon it, and comes sadly in: a finicall fellow he is, and very
fashionable, a stiff neck he has, which God hates, and a straight dublet,
which no drunkard could endure: for if he had it but one sitting, he would not
leave it worth a button, sure his tailor has not done well to make it so short
wasted: cry him mercy now I look so low, he has put all the waste in the
knees of his breeches, currage man: if she will not, another will.

Opinion of the Lover.
AS simple as he stands there (said Opinion) he has let his own arm blood
himself in stead of a Barber-Surgeon, and quaffed an health thereof in praise
of his Mistress when he had done: he has kneeled oftener in the honor of his
sweet heart then his Savior: he cruciateth himself with thought of her, and
wearieth al his friends with talking on her, he is trapt in so long
contemplation of her heavenly by him surmised beauty, that some times missing
his appointed meals, Oscula dat ligno, he kisseth the post, most dainty face,
supposing it his love, and imbraceth his pillow or the air in his arms
circumference, her body being only imagined present* he makes her a Dietie
with his adoration, and extolleth the luster of her eyes above the Sun and
Moon: he is eliuated into the third heaven when he dreameth of her, and will
admit no sublunarie resemblances in his comparisons concerning her: though she
have a Negroes head, a Virginian nose, a Spanish face, a Flemish neck and a
Turkish stature: all the morning he wastes in finifying his body to please her
eye, all the afternoon he culleth out choice and ^remeditate speeches to
delight her ear, all supper while (if they table together) he peereth and
prieth into the platters to pick out dainty morsels, to content her maw, and
almost all the night he watches and prays for her, sighing like a senseless
beast, and sobbing like a filly sot, if he be riuald and put besides her: to be
brief, he is his friends pity, his enemies derision, his souls sorrow, his
bodies decay, and his sweet-hearts derision: A forsaken lover.

Fido his Oration to the Lover, revealing his fondnes and fortune.
BY this it seems you are in love, with whom? a woman: good, what woman?
beauteous, rich, or honorable? so, how does she requite your love? with scorn,
hate, derision: she is a woman, the contrary to man, as one defines: the
greatest pleasure that can betide a man, when he is deprived of her: witness
Galba, who seeing his neighbors wife hang her self upon a fig tree, desired
a slip thereof to graft, hoping it would bear more such fruit, meaning his
wife: The toylsomest burden that combreth a man, as he certified, who when the
rest of his company cast ouer-bord such stuff as was most cumbersome unto
them (being so commanded by the Master of the Ship) took his wife in his
arms, with intent to fling her into the Sea, had he not been interupted. If
then a wife be the contrary to an husband, what concord can there be between
them? if a pleasure to be lost, who would sigh to be deprived of one? if a
burden and clogge to be kept, who would not skipp for joy to have his clogge
taken from him? But she is beauteous, rich, or honorable; what is beauty with
untoward conditions, but a fair flower with an ill savor, a painted sepulcher
filled with putrid bones? what are riches with wayward qualities, but golden
Mazers fraught with deadly poison? And as the Cynick likened a rich man without
knowledge, to a sheep with a golden fleece: so you may resemble a wealthy
woman with wilful manners, to a Jade with golden trappings: and what is
honor? a celestial thing, a radiant star (you will say) but those stars
are not all one some are fixae, some errantes, some cadentes: that is, some are
fixed, some wandering, some falling stars: but she you admired, was none of
the fixed, as her wandering and falling from you, shows: besides she scorneth,
hates and derideth you: if any of your best friends should serve you so, you
would renounce them, yet you will reverence her, your worst enemy: but men of
your mould are like Spaniels, which will creep nearest to them that cudgel
them; so the frowarder their sweet hearts are, the forwarder are they to
crouch unto them: Quod licet ingratu^ est, quod non licet acrius vrit, whereas
being less obsequious they might fare better, noui mulierum mores, vbi velis
nolu^t; vbi nolis cupiunt vltro. Some reason had Censorius Cato to leave this
precept, for future times, Trust not a woman: the dogged Philosopher knew
causes enough, when he said it was too late for the old man, and too soon for
the young to marry. Yet I speak not this in disgrace of virtuous women, or to
deter you from marriage: but for a man the King and commander of al earthly
crea ures, whose body is pure, whose mind more magnanimious, to be dejected in
spirit, pale in physnomy, lean in his limbs, and all for a woman: nay for
such a woman as does scorn, hate, and deride him: fie it is intolerable. Were
she true and faithful unto you, in lawful and honest sort, I would kindle and
combine you with the best counsel I could: but being otherwise, take these
precepts, which if you follow, will allay all lust and love in you: The first
is, to abandon idleness, the nurse of wantonness: The second, shun
solitariness, and be either doing something, or discoursing and passing the
time away in company: The third, to have a good conceit of your self, to
cheer up your spirits, and doubt not, but to have her betters: The fourth is,
to mince and extenuate any laudable part in her, but to display and augment
whatsoever deformity you know by her: for love is feigned blind, because he
cannot judge aright, but makes a mountain of a Molehill, a Saint of a Sow:
the best course therefore to banish him, is, to contrary him in all his
asseuerations, to prise at a low rate, that he highly vallueth: as for
instance, Is the party fat? fat meat will cloy any man: Is she lean?
what good stomach cares for bones? if she be pale of complexion, she will
prove but a puler: is she high colored? an ill cognizance: is she silent? the
still Sow will eat up all the draugh: does she talk much? a prattling gossip
she is likely to prove, and who would be troubled with a tatling tongue, and
such like? Fifthly, if she uses you hardly either in words or deeds, or
countenanceth any of your enemies or evil willers, set it down in your
Table-bookes, and write it upon the wall in your bedchamber, that you may at al
times better remember them: and consider, if she tendered you, she would not
wrong you: Many more could I express, but I should be ouer-tedious: therefore
to your fortune, which now is bad enough, neither would I wish any worse,
though I should wish them hanged, for hanging is the end of care, but love the
entrance: but what will be hereafter, that is as your choice is: if you be
advised, hope the best, if not, look for crooked fortune, as well as some of
your betters have had before you: away the Lover walked, and another came to
the gate.

The Virgin enters to know her fortune, Mockso describing her.
Who is it said Fido? Diana or one of her darlings, he replied, I am perplexed
with her proportion, the very glimse of her, has amazed me: beauty sits
enthronized on herbrowes, modesty in her eyes, health in her cheeks, silence
on her tongue, Balsamum in her breath, immaculation on her neck, temperance on
her waste, comeliness on her whole body: Cytherea may sigh at her portraiture:
Delia blush at her behavior: her looks turn not too and fro, her speech is
not obstreperous, no pride in her apparel, no affectation in her gate: the
map of modesty, and picture of pureness.

Opinion of the Virgin.
REmtenes (said Opinion) now you have laid giving aside, you have eased me of
a labor, a pur-blinde wit may perceive what she is: an immaculate virgin.

The Fortune Tellers Oration to the Virgin, encouraging her to chastity, and
showing her fortune.
AMiable Maid, which hitherto have led a chaste and unpolluted life, Non est
digna ponderatio continentis animae.
persevere still as you have begun, and make no doubt but to be right happy,
being enriched with so inestimable a jewel as chastity: which is a
caelestiall beatitude, the sister of the Angels, the conqueresse of
concupiscence, the Queen of virtues, although it vouchsafes to inhabit the
mind and body of you an earthly creature: seeing therefore it is such an
inestimable jewel, how warily are you to keep it? such a Peerless
Princess, how loyally are you to love it? Mayor victoria virginum quam
angelorum.
such a victorious triumpher, how carefully are you to guard it? so vnmatchably
allied, how much are you to make of it? All which that you may the better
effect, He gives her a Lilly the Hierogliphick of chastity.
I will bestow this flower upon you: it is a Lilly not natural, but
artificially composed like to a natural Lilly, having six silver leaves,
containing six several posies, to preserve your chastity: the first whereof
has this posie engraven in it: Cibi and potus sobrietas: that is, temperance
in eating and drinking, which is an efficient cause to quell and conquer
wantonness: whereas excess of both, or either of them, does animate and make
it rebellious, and also disfigure the party pleased with the same: for
immoderate eating breeds five blemishes in the behavior of a virgin, which
do deforme her reputation, more then fifteen wheales or pimples would disgrace
her face: The first is scurrility of speech, a naughty thing in any; The
second, talkatiuenesse or much babbling: The third, a foolish joy or petulant
kind of gesture: The fourth, vomiting, belching, or such like: The fifth,
drowsinesse of body and dullness of mind: which although they are slightly
observed in others: yet are they sooner marked in a maiden: as black spots
easier espied in a white cloth, then in dark colored vestures: touching
inordinate drinking of wine, all are forbidden it, but you especially of all
others, Virgo fugiat vinum vt venenum: nam vinum in adolescentia est duplex
incendium voluptatis: that is, a virgin ought to reject wine, as poison, which
is a twofold firebrand to kindle lust in youth: Sine Cerere and Baccho friget
Venus.
abstinence therefore is the first weapon to defend chastity, and put the
enemy to flight: which as it is comely in any presence, so it is commodious
for any feminine personage: keeping them from fogginesse, grosnesse and fiery
faces: Deducunt cibum, tametsi est bona natura vt reddant curatura iunceas,
that is, as one said of Virgins in his time, they pinch their bellies of meat
(a good custom) that they might be as small as bull-rushes. The second leaf
of this Lilly has engraven in it Asperitas vestitus, that is, coursenesse and
plainness of apparel: for garish and fantastical clothes, are speechless
reporters of wanton minds, therefore said one which had some trafique with
such light stuff: Vestitus in siguis and mollis superbiae vexillum, nidusque
luxury.
that sumptuous and soft raiments were the Ensigns of pride: but light and
loose clothing the index of luxury: and as in old time such as sold horses,
were wont to put flowers or boughs upon their heads, to reveal that they were
vendible: so, such as trim and trick themselves with toys and gewgawes, show
that they are willing, if any will: let therefore your apparel be plain, yet
comely, which will stop the mouth of evil report: and as course as you can
endure it, if you mean to tame your lust. Otia si tollas periere Cupidinis
arcus. Ovid.
The third leaf is set down laboris strenuitas: labor and exercise, for if
your mind be busied about any good huswifrie, or settled seriously upon any
honest exercise, lust can have no power over you, therefore we read how
Penelope, a constant Lady, would card and to ase wool her self, least she
should be idle, and consequently subject to lascivious thoughts and deeds, in
the ten years absence of her husband: and the Vestals if at any time they
had let the fire on the Altar go out, they were enjoined to kindle it again
with the beams of the sun. In the fourth leaf, is printed Custodia sensuum:
that is, not to give your senses any scope or liberty, Vitijs in animum per
oculos est via.
especially the sight, or hearing, for iniquity through the eyelids glideth
into the heart: and many have been entrapped by giving audience to the
alluring songs of the Sirens. In the fifth leaf, modestia verborum, modest
words you must use, qualis homo, talis oration, such as the woman is such are
her words, for a proud woman will be rapping arrogant words, a foolish woman
fond words, a wa^ton woman lascivious words, but a chaste woman modest words and
few: Therefore said a grave Father, that the speech of a virgin ought to be
wise, civil, slow and sparing: that she might be accounted as excellent for
her speech, as for her chastity: for evil words corrupt good manners. In the
sixth and last leaf of this Lilly, is written, Fuga opportunitatum, the
eschuing of opportunity, to shunn the company and conversation of men: for,
albeit I am a man my self, and shall be reputed foolish to bewray mine own
neast, yet to benefit such a goodly creature as your self, whom it were
villainy to injury, I will display the practices of some, though all use not
the same, that you may take heed of any, that would go about to rifle you of
your dearest jewel, without law or honesty, I mean marriage. Men generally are
wiser then women in goodness, yet are they sillier in wickedness and
contriuing deceit, then crafty and sensual women: and as they are more simple
then crafty women: so are they subtiller then well minded maidens, who as they
are guiltless of effecting deceit: so are they innocent of suspecting deceit.

It is no glory (I confess) to deceive a woman, no point of valor to
overthrow the weaker vessel, yet if this weaker vessel be artificially
garnished, and naturally beautified, what labor will they not take to attain
it? what watching will they omit to steal it? what wealth will they spare for
to compass it? and when they have gotten it into their custody, how do some of
them esteem it? even as children gewgaws, to dandle and play with it a while:
but as soon as they eye a new devise, they cast away the old, and never are
in quiet, till they be fingering the new, or as Warriors of old time, which
did spend much cost and pains to subdue a City, and when they had brought it
into subjection, rifled it and ransackt it; marched to another, and so to a
third, etc.

There was a pure virgin (as I heard) dwelling not far from me, who had so
firmly devoted her self to chastity, that the Inhabitants thereabout did
admire her; till a lusty gallant, rich and well proportioned wooed her, who
never left battering the Bulwark of her heart with piercing oaths, vows and
protestations, darted from his smooth tongue, till he had almost brought her to
the bay: within a while after she had considered his actions, how he would
tear his hair, weep in most seeming sadness, kiss her hand with fear and
trembling, and proffer unrequested many servile ceremonies, fearing her self
to break an oath or violate a vow, trusted that he had the same fear in him,
which he had not, condescended to his desire; which so soon as he had
accomplished, forsook her utterly: after him another came unto her, and served
her with the same sauce: then a third: at last, she began to wax wary: a
fourth came unto her, whose fashion was to try all, and if they agreed, left
them incontinently, but he labored in vain, for his gifts could prevail
nothing, nor his promises persuade her (she had fair warning one would
think): to be brief, he liked, loved and married her, and the second night as
they lay together, the good man said to her, Thou know sweet heart how often
I tempted thee, and I protest, if thou had consented, I had forsaken thee
utterly: tut, tut husband, said she, (sure she was half a sleep, and half
waking) I trow I was a little wiser then so, for three had served me in the
like sort, before ever I be^eld your face. This I do not relate, that you
should make the same experiment, but that you might avoid the like men, for he
that makes no scruple to break the seventh commandment, will make as little
conscience to keep the third: besides, if he should keep his promise, he
would have you always in jealousy: for if you fear not to displease God,
before you are married (who forbids fornication) will not your husband be
persuaded, that you will have as little fear to commit adultery, when you are
espoused? take this Lilly, and think upon every word and posie engraven in it:
and above all, believe not words importing any dishonest request. I have a
picture here to the same purpose: look upon this Lady, it was Dido Queen of
Carthage, who being too credulous in believing a wandering Prince, fell to
folly with him, and after forsaken, caused a great fire to be made, and for
grief and anguish leaped into it: this other is Phillis Queen of Rodope, a
virgin, before she lent an attentive ear to Demophoon, a man of royal race,
who after he had gotten his purpose, never returned near her again, so that
for shame and avoiding future sorrow, she hung her self, as this picture
lively expresses: take it with you, and think that if these two beauteous
Queens were deceived, it were an hazard for to trust, Fide, sed cui vide: it
is an old saying, try before you trust: but if Maidens follow that saying,
they may be trust round before, and after served as these were. Away the
Virgin walked, like Juno in the Empire, and others were at the gate e^^ting
entrance, but Fido being weak and wea^ dismissed them, till some other time,
and forthwith committed his self to his Closet.

FINIS.
