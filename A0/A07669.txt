Philip Moore to the gentill reader.
I Have (gentill reader) set forth this small treatice, which I have
intiteled the hope of Health: because my chief intent in making thereof, was to
exhort both men and women (to preserve their healthes) and to bestow soche
labor in making of Gardaines, and in plantyng of sundry herbs, that their
Gardaines might be to them and theirs, instead of a poticaries shop: wherein
they may find soche medicines, as are prescribed to them by the Physician,
without any great cost, and to their singular profit. in this treatise you
shall find: First, what things are necessary to be known, for the
preseruacion and mainteinaunce of health. Seco^darily, what things are to be
observed, concerning thine ordinary diete, in sundry meats to anoide
sickness. Thirdly, thuse of a Gardein, and the natures of sundry herbs.
Fowerthlie, the declaracion of sickness and the commodities of medicines. Last
of all, you shall find certain rules of Astronomy, whereof the most part are
annexed unto Physic: which simple labors of mine, if you will vouchsafe
willingly to accept, you shall encourage me, to bestow greater pains, for
thinstruccion and commodity of the good readers, as far forth as my small
learning will extend. Thus fare you well. From Hallesworth in Suff. The first
of May.

Anno salutis. M.D.lxiiij.
TO THE RIGHT Worshipful sir Owen Hopton knight: Philip Moore wishes
eternal felicitee.
WHen I consider with my self (right worshipful sir) the great number of
external benefits, which it has pleased almighty God, of his infinite
mercy and goodness, to bestow upon all mankind: Although I am certainly
persuaded, that no man is able to thank and praise him, for the least of them
sufficiently, yet I do think nevertheless, that each man has cause to give
thanks to God, more for his health then he has for any other worldly
promocion or benefit: as riches, possessions, honor, dignity, and soche like.
For with out worldly wealth, a healthful manne may live in that vocacion,
Wealth without health is nothing.
wherein God has called him, with pleasure and good company: But to a man
which is extreme sick, riches be noisome, possessions superfluous, honor
neclected, dignity despised, pleasures be loathsome, and company is
comberous, thereby also strength and pleasure be altered into imbecillitie and
weakness. Pain has no pleasure.
And last of the lively ruddie color and beauty of the face, is converted
into deadly palenesse, and deformity. Since therefore, health is soche a
precious jewel to ma^kinde, that without it, all worldly pleasures are
painful. I think it meet and expedient for each manne, that has any regard
to himself, to learn the knowledge of the constitucion of his body, and to
observe a mean in his diet, and other necessary things concerning his health
that thereby he may escape dauugerous diseases, and preserve his body long
in good state, or at the least he may signify to the Physician a great deal
the better, the occasion of his sickness by due obseruacions: so may
conueniente medicines be much sooner ministered, whereby health will quickly
be recovered again. In consideracion whereof I am persuaded, that all men that
be of good judgment and understanding, do think them worthy of great
praise, and of immortal praise, which have by continual study, long
trauaille, and good experience found out and left behind them to us their
posterity, soche an art and science, as is hable to enstructe a man, not
only to heal and cure, a great number of grievous diseases (whereunto each
man's body, is daily subject.) But also it teaches, to preserve and keep
the same body in health, so long as the course of nature will suffer a man to
live. These be the effects, which the most excellent art of Physic, can
certainly perform, to as many as will diligently observe the precepts and
doctrine thereof, which noble science, as holy scripture does testify, was
not a fond inuencion of coueteous heddes for lucres sake, but is certainly
the necessary gift of God, Donu^ dei.
by him ordained, and sent among mortal men, to the end that by the help
thereof, they might the longer sustain, and preserve their frail bodies in
health, preventing sickness that would ensue, and curyng that which is
present, which things are evidently declared, in diverse places of the
Bible, but most plainly in the.38* chapter of Ecclesiast. where it is
written after this sort. Affice medicum suis honoribus and premijs, vt
necessitate vrgente eo vti possis nam eum creauit dominus* Est enim a supremo
medicina, and a regestipendium accipiet. Dn^s ex terra co^didit medicamenta,
and prudens homo no^ contemnit ea, cede locum medico, dominus enim illum
creauit. That is to say, give unto the Physician due honor and rewards, that
thou may have his help in time of need, for the Lord has ordained him. The
greatest Minister of God among men, next the divine* to the Phisi^ion.
Truly Physic is of the highest and it shall receive a stipe^de of the king.
The Lord has made medicines on the earth: and a wise man will not conte^ne
them. Give place unto the Physician, for the lord has ordained him. By which
words it is evident, that Phisike is ordained of God, for the profit and
commodity of all mankind, which although perchance it has been, and is
abused, ought never the more to be hated or despised. For, there is no science
nor knowledge in the world, so perfect and good, but that it has been of
evil persons abused: As it is evident, the holy scriptures being Gods
eternal veriti^, have sondrie times heretofore, been abused of many sorts of
detestable heretics, as of Arrians, Anabaptists, and the damnable, A secr^
called the Bonerites, or Renobites.
vile, Romish Papists, the Darbellites, the Garnarites, the Bonerites etc.
which wrieth and wresteth the scriptures, to their erroneous and Deuilishe
opinions, deceiuyng the ignoraunte people, and bringing them to utter
distruccio^.

In so much therefore as Phisike is so highly commended to us in his holy
scripture, as a special gift of God, and also it is known to be, by daielie
experience, most commodious, profitable, and necessary for all kind of
persons, being endued with understanding, not being ignorant al together in
soch precepts thereof, as do necessarily pertain to the preseruacio^ of his
health. So that each man should so far forth behold his own body, that he
might by dilligent obseruacion, know when he were in health, and what diet he
ought chiefly to observe, for to preserve the same in health and good state,
which thing if it were well observed, would redounde most certainly, to the
great commodity of an infinite noumber of people, defendyng them from diverse
pains and diseases, into the which, many through their own ignorance and
necligence, do often times fall. And therefore, I thought it very good, to
wish all men, to seek the knowledge of soche things, as concern health.
For which cause (right worshipful sir) I have endeuoired my self (as much as
in me lies) to declare and comprehend in this small treatise, soche rules of
Physic as are profitable to be known and observed, of all soche as be
desirous to preserve their bodies in health. Not arrogantlie presumyng hereby,
to enstructe the learned and skillful: but being moved with good will and
natural affeccion, to the readers hereof, according to my simple knowledge, I
purpose by this my small trauaille, to declare unto the willing minded, good
rules of Phisike, wherein the hope of health do consiste. Hope of Health.
And also to prescribe unto them, the use and commodities of a good Gardaine,
with the names, natures, and virtues of diverse herbs, which are very
requisite for meats and medicines. Being partly provoked thereunto, by that
which I have perceived in your own self, that neither good will has been
wanting, nor cost spared, to make a pleasant ground, furnished with many
wholesome and sweet herbs and flowers, as at this present time appears, at
your ancient Mansion called Cockfeld halle, which example I would wish many
ge^tleme^ should imitate. But chiefly again I was moved, to write somewhat of a
gardein and herbs, because the greatest part of curing of diseases by
medicines, does co^siste in herbs, which ye vulgar people ar so ignorant
in, that they neither know them, nor yet do endeuoire them selves to have
any store of them in their Gardaines, which is greatly to their
discommoditie. Truly these causes moved me after that I had declared, what
things were mete to be known and observed, for presecuacio^ of health, to
speak somewhat of the commodities of a Gardain, that is well furnished with
sundry herbs: declaryng also the names, natures, and virtues, of soche herbs
as be most common in this region of England, to thentente I might provoke the
common people, to have herbs in better estimacion, and to learn to know
them, to plant them, and sow them in their gardaines, cherishyng them as
things, whereby they may obtain remeadie of painful diseases, by the
cou^saill of a discrete Physician, without any great cost or trauail. To this
end I have declared unto your worship, my purpose and intent, in publishyng
this small treatise, which I do dedicate unto you, as an assured token of my
duty, and good heart toward your worship, being thereto provoked, by the
singular benefits, received at your hands. For which benefits (according
to my ability) in steed of a recompense, I signify unto your worship, by
this simple gift, that I am not unmindful of my duty. Wherefore I desire
you (right worshipful sir) to accept this my simple travail, being the
fruits of that small talent, which God has vouchesaued to lend me, in good
part. Thus wishyng unto your worship, and to my good Lady your bedfellowe,
long continuance of perfect health, with increase of much worship: I commit
you to the tuicion of the almighty God, whose hand always preserve you and
yours. AMEN.

Your maisterships must humble to command. Philip Moore.

IN this former Calendar, what day of any monethe you do chose, you shall
straight find in the first row toward the left hand, in what sign, and in
what degree the Son is in. In the second row you shall find what hour,
and what minute the Son sets. In the fowerth row is declared the length
of the day, between Son and Son, in hours and minutes. In the fifte row
is set forth the length of the night, from Son set, to Son rise. In the
sixte row is the noumber of days of the month. And in the seventh row is
the golden noumber. Last of all is the dominicall letter, and the saints
days. As for example. If you look the second day of April, straighte you
shall find in the first row, that the Son is in the.22. degree of Aries. The
Son rises. 16. minutes after.5. of the clock, and sets.44. minutes
after.6. of the clock, the day is.13. hours and.35. minutes in length: and
the night is.10. hours and.35. minutes long, and so may you find in like
sort for any day, throughout the whole year.

Note, when I speak of minutes, that there be in an hour.60. minutes: and
so.45. minutes be three quarters of an hour, and.30. minutes be half an
hour, and.15. make a quarter of an hour. So that when I said before, yt the
second day of April, the Son rises.16. minutes after.5. of the clock, I
mean it rises one quarter of an hour and a minute after.5. And so
understand likewise of all minutes. Note, that there be.12. signs in the
Zodiac of the heavens, and every sign is divided into.30. degrees: so that a
degree is the 30. part of a sign.

The names and Charectes of the.12. signs are these Aries, Taurus, Gemini,
Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces.
These things I have thought good to be added in the end of the Calendar, for
the better instruccion of them that be ignorant, lest if they should doubt
in any part of it, they were not able of them selves, to find out the
knowledge thereof. I was fully determined, when I began this small treatise,
to have added unto it, diverse necessary rules of Astronomy, concerning the
mocions of the heavens, and of the planettes, and certain fixed stars that
the reby men that travail, either by land or by sea, might know the parts
of ye heavens and judge certainly the true hour of all seasons, as well by
night as by day. But because I did consider, that these things did nothing
appertain unto these matters, y^ I have made mention of in the premises. And
also because convenient leisure was wanting, I thought it better to differ
mine endeavor at this present entending God willing, to publishe it with other
necessary precepts of like sort, perteining to Cosmographie, and the
Mathematical sciences, as soon as convenient time shall be ministered unto me:
if so be I may perceive this my simple labor to be thanckfullie accepted.

The first book teaches diverse precepts, very necessary to be known, of
soche as are studious to preserve the body in health.
The.i. Chapter.
Of the constitucion and original of man's body.
MOses the most faithefull servant of the high God, being enspired with the
holy ghost, and writing of the beginning of the world does evidently declare
in the book, which is called Genesis. Genesis. i.
That almighty God by his omnipotency (after that he had made all other
living creatures in the world) he created Adam and Eve our first parents,
blesyng them and saying, increase, and multiply, and replenishe the earth:
which blessyng (although after it, through their transgression, they were
driven out of the pleasant Paradise, and cast forth into this vale of
misery, the earth, them selves, and their posteritee, being cursed for their
offense) yet it took soche effect that all mankind, which have been since
that time, until this day, have proceeded of them and their posteritee, being
engendered by the conjunction of their pare^tes. Soche was the wonderful
providence of God omnipotent, Generatis v^ius est corruption alterius. Aristo.
de generatione.
from the beginning that all living creatures, should contain in them selves
soche seed, as does suffice to engender their like in their kind, that
thereby the frailtee and mortalitee of each kind of living creates, might by
succession be preserved from utter decaie, and remain from age to age:
continually increasing by many hundred years, to the setting for the of Gods
glory, which thing as does plainly appear in every kind of creature: so it
may sufficiently and most manifestly be perceived, Deus been vidit presentia
and futura.
by considering the state of mankind. Whose life, although for the most part
after Noes blood, it has not exceaded an hundred years in one particular man,
yet none can deny but at this day, (being above five thousand years from the
beginning of the world) the number of men is so infinite proceaded of the two
former persons our first parents, The cause of generation after the Divines
and Phisicions.
that they be as the fan^e of the sea, or as the stars of the heaven,
innumecrable. The body therefore of each mankind, (the two former persons
only excepted) is inge^dred of the sead of his pare^tes in his mothers womb
each part of the body, being their fourmed and fashioned by divine nature,
receiving no norishement of blood until ye full time of birth. But after that
the infant is borne into the world, as long as it is tender And weak, it is
fed and nourished with milk, and when strength is increased then meats are
ministered to it of sundry substance, (...) est corporibus puerorum. Aristo. de
conomicorum.
and harder of digestion. Wherein if a due order and moderate measure be kept,
and certain other necessary circumstaunces observed, which both reason and art
prescribes as shall be hereafter declared, then the body continues always
unto the last age in safety, and health, moreover each member keeps his
natural estate, and is both able and ready to do soche functio^s and business
as nature has ordained them to do. As the stomach to have a good appetite,
^ale. de vs^^ artium. lib. vi.
and to digest and alter meats well, the liver to engender good blood, the
raynes to separate urine from the blood, and soche like, excepting always some
external and violent outward cause, which may hinder their operation, as a
wind, a fall, or soche like, of which I entende not to speak further in this
place.

The.ii. Chapter.
what things be requisite for him to know which would keep his body in
health.
THe preservation of health does chiefly consiste in knowledge of the body, and
in due and moderate use of sustinaunce ministered to the same. Of the first part
I will chiefly entreat in this book.

First it is requisite to come to ye knowledge of our bodies, by understanding
whereof they are compacte and made.

Secondarily, Five good notes to be marked.
it is good and needful to know the differences of the parts of the body.

Thirdly, their offices and powers, are to be considered.

Fourthly, the diversity of humains.

Last of all, the complexions of the bodies, are to be diligently marked: which
things duly and exactely considered and noted. A mete diet may sone be
serched out, which if it be observed there is no doubt, but health may be
preserved and sickness eschued so long as nature is able to sustain the body,
Follow the example of a true Phisicia^
which thing Galen the Prince of all Physicians declared in him self, who
although by nature he had a weak body which was subject to many diseases in
his youth, yet he confesses him self, that after eightene years of age being
the^ somewhat skilful in physic, he so preserved his body, that from those
years until the time of his death, which many report to be about the hundred
year of his age, he was never vexed with any sickness, except it were with a
sever called Ephemera, Ephemera est febris ex repletione. etc.
which lasts but one day, and that also he could easily have avoided, if he
had not more regarded at sometime to pleasure his friend with his art, then to
observe in all points the exact preservation of his health. But peradventure
some will allege for this one example, which is by hearsaye that they have
seen and do know diverse Physicians which be often subject to sundry
diseases, as well as other sorts of men. And therefore, this little persuades
them that any art may preserve a man long in health: Two Phi^icions, the
first for pro^ite, the second ^or pleasure.
to whom I answer that there is great difference between those that study
physic only to get a living thereby, and them that search out the knowledge
thereof to guide their lives according to the doctrine of it. Of this last sort
of Physicians was Galen, who thought it a great reproach both to the science
and to himself, if this proverb might truly have been verified of him.
Aliorum est medicus ipse vlceribus statens, that is to say: he is Physician to
other himself being full of byles and sores. Of the same sort also, many other
famous Physicians have been, and at this present be, Medicus (...) te ipsum.
which men of indifferent and upright judgment do and may easelye perceive.
But of the first sort, if there have been any, or by chance at this present
be, I think they are an example to discredit this noble science, only to
those that be ignorant, rude and unlearned, who for that cause are enemies of
this art. And therefore it is a true proverb, Scientia non habet inimicum nisi
ignorantem, that is: none is enemy to any knowledge or science, but he that is
ignorant in it: if any that be unlearned, do take occasion to despise
phisike as a vain thing, taking example at the life of the first sort of
phisitio^s aforenamed, Stomblers at strawes, despisers of virtue.
I think I may safely judge that they do it of an obstinate stubburnes, or of
a cancred hatred, or else of wilful blindness, like as the vile Renobites and
Papists at this present day, do seek means to discredit credit preachers
as much as they can, by scrupulous serching and examininge of their living,
which sometime they find to disagree from their doctrine. God give them grace
to repent in time, that they lay no soche stumbling blocks in weiklinges
ways. Now I will leave the^, and return again to my purpose, declaring in
order the things requisite to be understood, for the knowledge of our
bodies, as is aforesaied.

The. iii. Chapter.
whereof man's body is compacte.
FIrst it is to be noted that there are four Elements, Elememta inquet
Auicenna sunt corpora simplicia and, sunt parts prime corporis humane and
aleorum. etc.
that is; fire, air, water, and earth, which elements have in the^ contrary
qualities one to an other, that is, heat, cold, drienes, and moisture. And
the earth is the loweste and heauiest element, and it is cold and dry by
nature: Next the earth is the water, being cold and moist. The air is above
the water, and is hot and moiste. Then comes in the fire, which is the
highest and the lightest element, being hot and dry.

Of these four elements (according to the sentence of Hipocrates, and Galene,
and all other physicians of that sect) nature has framed and made each man's
body. So that every man's body is compact and does consiste of the four
Elements which are so mixed together by nature, De temperamentis humani
corporis ex Galen^^
that none of them does remain simple and pure in man's body. And therefore
we ought not to think that pure fire or water, air or earth, should be
contained in man's body, if that he be made thereof, because the elements are
not unmixed in any living creature, but like as in a medicine made of wax,
pitch rosyn and tallowe, when they are melted together, there appears neither
ware, nor pitche, Example of complexions.
nor rosyn, nor yet tallowe, but a thing co^pounded of their substance which
retains their qualities and yet is like none of them. Even so in man's body
which consists of the four elements being co^mixed by nature in his
generation, none of the elements is to be seen or perceived simply and
seperatly, but there appears evidently a substance commixed and made of the
elements, which substance retains in it the qualities of them, and yet is
like none of the^. Our senses must be satisfied in matters of reason
It shall be sufficient therefore (for him that is not so much addicte to his
senses) that he will believe nothing but that which he man see, feel, or
perceine, with outward senses: When he sees in the body any member that is
cold and dry, and hard as bones, gristles, or such like, he may consider
that the substance of earth is there, where he finds his qualities, as
likewise when he sees blood moiste and liquid, he may perceive that ye element
of water is there. The great heat that is in a living body may put him in mind
of the element of fire: Elementa non m^net ^n mixto allu s^d in vire (...).
Aristo. lib. de generatione.
Like as also the breath of man may sone persuade him yt the element of air is
in man's body. This example I have brought forth only to cause a deper
consideration of the coniunctio^ of the four eleme^tes in man (...) which
although it can not be judged by outward senses, yet is it certainly to be
credited that every member in man's body be it never so small, does consiste of
the four eleme^tes. And therefore the ancient Physicians defines an element,
saying it to be the lest and most simple portion of that thing which it does
constitute and make. The cause why the knowledge of ye eleme^tes is both mete
and necessary, as well for him that is studious to preserve health, as for the
Physician is, that each of the^ may understand that health does consiste in a
natural temperature of heat, De elementorum naturis. ex Aui^^^na. etc.
cold, drynes, and moisture. And contrariwyse that disease chance to the body
by distempure of the said four qualities of the eleme^tes, for nature has
given to every member of the body in the time of generation a most mete and
apt temperaturefrom which if any member do decline in heat, cold, drynes or
moisture, there follows some disease in that member which is consequent to
the quality abounding or waunti^^.

The. iiii. Chapter.
Of the difference of parts in man's body.
THough the parts of ma^s body be mani in nombre, yet they at comprehended in
a few divisions. Note therefore that there be some parts of the body that be
called in Latin (Simdares parts,) that is to sat, soche parts as being
divided, each piece is like the whole part, and may well be called by the same
denomination and name: Doctor La^g ton have noted this from Leonardus Fut^hius
in a good Method.
As for example, the least peace of flesh is to be called flesh, as the whole
member from which it was separate. And these following be commonly called
Similari or like parts, that is, flesh, bones, sinues, gristles, filmes,
ligame^ts, veins, arteries and such like. Some other parts in the body be
called in Latin Instrumentales or dissimilares parts, that is,
instrumentalles and unlike parts, and s^che members are compou^ded and do
consiste of the said similarie and like parts: As the head, the hand, the
foot, and such other members, that are compact of bones, sinues, flesh,
veins, and other aforenamed. Note also that of isntrumental members there be
two sorts: Cor est principi^^ sensus and motus in animali. Aris. de som^o and
^^gilia.
whereof they that be of the first sort be called principal members. And
they are four in nombre (that is to say) the brain, the heart, the liver,
and the stones. And these are called principal members, because without the
three first, no man may live. And without the last, the generation of mankind
should cease* All other instrumentarie members besides these four, are less
principal, and are to be coumpted of the second sort Note moreover that to y^
aforesaid four principal members, there he four ministers or ha^dmaydes,
that is, senues, arteries, veins, and sparmatike vessels, whereof senues
serves for the brain, Arteriarum ascendentium^ descendentiumqu^ series. ex
Galen^ libro de dissectione arterri^^^ Cap. ix.
Arteries for the heart, veins serve for the liver, and sparmatike vessels for
the stones. Thus much have I spoken for the general difference of members in
man's body: As for the knowledge of special, or particular differences of each
part of every member, I refer the Reader to books of Anatomies.

The. v. Chapter.
Of the offices and powers of members in man's body.
THe faculty virtue or power y^ nature has graffed in any member, Facultates
animal gub^nantes ^res (...) inter s^ gen^^is hab^ns (...) quarum alia dicitur
animalis vitalis, naturalis.
is the cause from whence the action, doing, or working* of that member
proceeds and springs. It behooves us therefore first to search out what
faculties there be in the body, that thereby the operations of members may
appear. Note that there be three diverse faculties or powers which do
govern the whole body of man. And they be called in Latin Animalis facultas,
vitalis, and naturalis, that is, the animal power, the vital, and the natural
power. And these three faculties be engraffed and do proceade from the three
first principal members, that we have made me^^^^ of in the former chapter,
(that is) from the brain, Animalis in (...) trimlis ^erebri continetu^ G^le^
de methodo medendo. lib. ^ii.
the heart, and the liver, from which members all other parts of the body
receive their force and virtue. For in the brain consists the faculty and
power animal, which is derived and sent from the^se by synowes that syring
there into al parts of the body, g^uing sense and moving throughout the
body, and increasing wit. And therefore it is to be noted that there be three
sundry actions or operations, that proceade from this faculty, into diverse
parts of the body. The first action whereof the power animal is cause, A^lus
prim^ etc ^ corpore h^mani
is outward sense, and that is done (...) manner of ways, that to, by seeing,
hearing, smelling, tasting and feling. The second action is volu^tarie moving
of any member, whereby a man may move any member of his body when he will, and
state it at his pleasure, as the moving of the leg, the arm, the head the
tongue and such like. The third action is inward sense, and wit, or
understanding, and it is called in Latin Princeps, It may be called in
English principal or chief. Partlum interios ^um capitis ex ^aleno.
And there be three kinds thereof, that is imagination or common sense, reason
or fantasy: And memory whereof (according to Philosophers opinions) the
imagination consists in the formoste part of the brain over the forehead,
and fantasy remains in the middle of the brain. Last of all, memory is
placed in the hindermost part of the brain above the noddle of the neck. The
second faculty or power, De facultatibus humani in cord (...) Galeno.
which is called the vital faculty, does consiste in the heart, which is the
fountain of life and natural heat, and it spreads from thence in arteries
or pulses, that have their first beginning there, into al parts of the body,
giving life to the whole body, wherefore the chief action and operation of
this faculty proceading, is the giving of vital and lively breath to all
members, which thing is performed by the pulses, continually opening or
rising up, and shutting or falling down, which when they open they draw into
themseues cold air, which air does recreate, there up, and refreshe the
power vital, whereof also the power animal is engendered. But when the pulses
or Arteries shut, Partium humani corporis.
they exp^l and drive out soche fumous and smoky excrementes as are engendered
through burninge or boiling of humors in the whole body, Alie Calide.
Frigide. Humide, Siccae. Ve Spiritus. Cor. Sanguinis. Ietur.
for natural heat is not unlike to a fire, which in boiling of any liquor
raises a great fume, even so when natural heat will turn the substance of
meats, received into the substance of the members of our body, it first
boileth them and tries them, taking so much of them as is most apt and
mete. And the rest is expelled out of the body; and is called an excrement.

The third and last faculty or power that governs the body, is called the
natural faculty, which consists in the liver, and it is sent from thence
into all members of the body, in veins which do their begin and spring,
ministering nourishement and food to each member. And note, that this faculty
is the cause of four sundry operations, which it gives to each member, and
that is attraction, retention, digestion, and expulsion, whose virtues are as
follows. First by the power attractiue every member does draw unto it soche
Iuise and food as is metest to nourishe it. Of the four natural virtues.
Secondarely, by the power retentiue, each member is able to keep still and
retain the iuyse that is drawn to it until it be altered and changed into
the substance of the member that it should nourishe, and these two faculties
are ministers, or ha^dmaides to the altring or disgesting faculty. Thirdly, by
the digestive or altering power, that iuyse which is drawn to any member and
retained there, is digested, altered, and changed into another substance, and
by the same power also it is aglutinate and joined to the member which is to be
nourished. And last of all, it is made like to yt member which it nourishes*
Fourthly, by the expulsive power each member is able to separate, expulse, and
drive from it al such superfluitees as be unprofitable, to nourishe that
member and soche as nature is not able to alter and digeste, soche
superfluities and excrementes each member has power by the expulsive facultee
to drive from it, lest if they should tarry long in any part of the body, they
would putrify and rotte. These be the principal powers and operations which I
already have rehearsed. Hypo^rates (...).
But beside them other members that are less principal, have their peculier
operations: as the longes draws in, and sends fourth breath, the stomach
desires meats and drinks. The liver draws the iuy^e of meats and drinks
out of the stomach, and the guts and turns it into blood, the gail
draws colerique humors from the blood, the spleen draws melancholy
humors from the blood: The raines draw and separate urine from the blood,
Reni^^ e^^^icae.
and sends it down into the bladder. And diverse other members have peculier
operations, which would be to long to rehearse in this small treatise.

The.vi. Chapter
Of the diuersitee of humors in man's body.
THere be in the body of all mankind; De humoribus aliter ex Galeno and
alils.
four sondrie humors, that is, blood, fleume, choler, and melancholy: which
humors are daielie nourished and engendered, of the iuise of meats and
drinks, received into the body, and there altered by natural heat. These
humors, Sanguis. Vituita. Bilis. Flaua. Atra bilis.
may be called the second elements, or the elements of man, for they are
equalle with the elements, and they have also the qualities of Elements. For
blood is hot and moiste, like the air, fleume is cold and moiste, like the
water: Choler is hot and dry, like the fire, and Melancholy is cold and
dry, like the earth. These.4. humors, as long as the body is in health, do
remain in soche portion, as nature ordained them in, at the first generation
of the body: and they keep their appointed places, their colors, tastes, and
operations, for which nature ordained them.

Know therefore, Sanguinis vsus. etc.
that blood is engendered in the Liver, of the iuise that is drawn out of the
stomach, and is more aboundaunte in a hail man, then any of the humors
beside: it is spread from the Liver by veins, into al parts of the body, his
use and property is to nourishe each member. And if the blood he natural, it
is hot and moiste, or rather temperate: it is red in color, and sweet in
taste, which plainly appears in healthful folk.

Fleume that is naturalle, is less in quantity then blood, it is chiefly
engendered in the stomach, and it is as it were nourishemente half digested,
or half turned into blood, which being drawn with the iuise of meats and
drinks to the Liver, the greateste part of it tourneth into blood. The use
and property of the rest of phlegm, is to make the blood to flow more
quickly in the veins: and phlegm also, because it is liquid and slipperie, it
helps the mouyng of y^ joints. And note, that natural phlegm is cold and
moiste in operacion, white in color, and without taste like water.

Choler that is natural, is less in quality then Phlegm. And note, that
nature has appoincted for it, a peculiar recepta^le and seat, that is a
bladder, hanging on the Liver, commonly called the Gall: lest if that Choler
should be mingled with the blood, all the body would be yelowe, as it is in
the yelowe Iau^dise And therefore nature has ordained, that when Blood is made
in the Liver, the Gall draws from it Cholerike humors to make it the more
pure. ^ecur generaito^is sanguinis.
The use and property of Cholere, is to flow into the guts, that it might
scour them, and cleanse them from Flegmatike excreme^tes, and that it might
help their excrecion (that is) that it might raise and stire up the virtue
expulsive, to drive out the egestions in due time. The Choler that is natural,
is hot and dry in operacio^, yelowe in color, Melancholici ^unoris.
and bitter in taste.

As for Melancholy it is as it were the dregs, and ground soppes of Blood,
which if it be natural, it is lest in quantity of all humors. And it is to
be noted, that nature has appoincted a member in man's body, The profit of
the spleen.
commonly called the Spleen or Milt, which draws from the blood, this
black and yearthlie humor: lest if it should flow with the blood in the
veins, it would make the color of the whole body black; as it chances in
the black Iaundise, wherein Melancholy flows all over the body, with blood
in the veins. The spleen therefore is ordained by nature, to draw away the
dregs, and thick residence of the blood. The use and property of the
Melancholy in man's body, is to nourishe the Spleen, and to help the accio^s
and operacions of the stomach: for it causes the stomach to comprehend well
in it self, meats that are received, and to retein and keep them until they
be fully digested. The color of natural Melancholy is black like earth: it
is cold and dry in operacion, and sour in taste.

These ar the qualities and quantities which are naturally contained in the
humors of man's body. But if it so chance, that any of these humors do
alter, by any means in quantity, color, substance, taste, or place, then
they cause sickness little or much, according to the excess or decrease, or
malignaunt qualities of the humors, declining from his natural state, which for
brevity I let pass.

The.vii. Chapter.
Of the complexions of man's body.
THe ancient Phisicions do say, Temperamentu^. Ignis. Aer. Aqua. Terra.
that a complexion or temperament is nothing else, but a mixture of the four
elements: that is Fire, Air, Water, and Earth, and they make.ix. sondrie
kinds of complexions, one that is temperate, and eight that be not temperate,
whereof four be simple, that is, hot or cold, or moiste, or dry. And.iiij.
be compounde, that is hot and moiste, or cold and moiste, hot and dry, or
cold and dry. But soche men as write, according to the capacity, or
understanding of the reader: they do sat, that a complexion is a mixture of
the four humors in man's body, that is Blood, Phlegm Choler, and
Mela^cholie. And they make but four sondrie complexions, according to the
number of those humors, which doctrine of theirs, although it be far
inferior to the other, yet it is not unprofitable, but worthy to be marked
of all men: for, thereby they may have cause to consider that sum humor
does abound more in some one manne, then in an other, whereby the qualities
and disposicions of diverse men are altered. It is necessary therefore, for him
that would know, of what complexion him self, or any other person is, to
observe and mark, as well the inward qualities and disposicions of the mind,
as also the outward signs of the body, according to the precepts here next
insuyng.

The body wherein blood or air, has dominion and preheminen^ does abound on
heat and moisture, and it is counted Sanguine of complexion, and it may be
known by these signs.
Mirth, jesting, and familiarity, delight in pastimes. Liberality, and
freenes of heart, Simplicity, and mean wit. Seldom angry. Pulse great and
swifte, and full. Fleshines of members, without fat, Prones to carnal lust.
Largenes and fulness of the veins, and arreries. Abundance of ordure and
urine, swette without evil sauoure. Aptnes to bleding at the nose, and flures
of blood, and diseases thereof. Color of the face and body ruddie mixed with
white and read. Often dreaminges of blood and redd things without fear.
Desire of wine, good digestion. Urine reddishe, and often gross. Reddishe
hear in great abu^daunce.
The body wherein fle^^e or water has pre-eminence does abound in cold and
moisture, and it is called ^h^eginatike of complexio^, which may be known by
these signs.
Forgetfulness. Dulnes of wit and sense in learning. Slothfulness and
hoa^inesse in mouinge. Ouermuche stepines. Colors of the face and body, white
sallow, pale or leady. Much fatnes without sound flesh. The pulse small,
slow, seldom, and soft. Reumatike, and full of spittle, sweet, white and
thick. Much moistor coming out at the nose and mouth. Digestio^ slow and
weak. Appetite of sour and sharp meats. Smothe shynne without hears.
Cowardlines and fear. Urine whitish pale and thin. Swette whitish and
unsavory. Dreams of waters, snow and rain. etc. Whitish hears. Delighte in
hot things, hurt ensuing cold things. Veins small and little apering.
The body wherein Cho^er or Fire has dominion does abound in heat, and
drines, and is named Cholerike of complexion, and it may be known by these
signs.
Rashenes in all things, quick wit, Subtilitie, prodigality. Irefulnesse,
boldness, and hardiness, Desire of reuengement sharply, Hearines and
roughnes. Drines, and leanesse of the body. Hear read, Aburne, and curled.
Color of the eyes and face yelowe, like the iaundise. The pulse great,
swifte, and hard. The urine like fine gold in color, or like fire.
Impatiente with hunger or thirste. Drynes of the tunge, and roughnes, Little
filthe in the nose, and little spittle Sone very angry, and sone appeased.
Watching very long, and often. Dreaminges of battaill, murder, fire, and
bloodshed. Delight in cold things. Quick and strong of digestion. Swifte and
light of body* Often ^nawyng in the mouth, of the stomach and costiuenes in
middellage.
The body wherein Melancholy or earth has dominion, does abound in
coldness and dryness, and is named melancholy of complexion, and it may be
known by these signs.
Gravity and simplicity. Evil disposition, so that often they kill
themselves. Envy, covetousness nigardnesse, fearfulness, sorrow, weping*
kepi^g secret co^s^^, solitary, witty, constant in opinion. Slow to anger.
Hard to please after anger. Leanesse and roughness of the whole body.
Blackness or s^artnesse of the face and skin. Hear black and plain. Pulse
slow little and hard Urine subc^^ine, grenish or (...) bright and (...)
swearing. Oftentimes black (...) dreams of death, grauce; and soche like.
Content with small sleping Impatiente of cold.


By these signs and qualities before rehearsed, each man may learn to know of
what complexion he is of, if he will diligently consider the same. And note that
it shall be sufficient to judge his co^plexio^ to be according with y^ humor to
which for the most part his qualities and outward signs be agreing, and
inclining. Although all the properties prescribed to the humor, do not agree
with him. For the disposition of the mind, and also the state of the body,
are oftentimes altered and changed from their natural course, sometime to
better, and some time to worse, according to the good or evil education of the
party. As (among ^^anie) this one example does declare, which is written of
ancient and credible Historiographiers.

There was sometime in Greece a man which was named Zopirus, (...) his virtue.
who by beholding of a man's face, could know his complexion and judge his
conditions. This man beholding Socrates, an excellent Philosopher, judged him
to be prodigal and unchaste: Which judgment when Socrates familiar friends
had heard they lawghed Zopirus to scorn, because they knew Socrates to be
most centinent and thristie. But Socrates said unto them, Zopirus has nothing
erred in his judgment, for certainly I had been of soche qualities as he
judges me to be of, if I had not by Philosophy subdued nature. Hereby it is
evident that natural dispositions of men may be altered. And that is the cause
why all the qualities and signs prescribed before in any of the complexions be
not found to agree to every particular man of that co^plexio^, wherefore it is
sufficient if the most of the^ do agree with him. Note this well.
The commodities that ensue the knowledge of a man's own complexion are many
and notable, for thereby a man may learn to eschew the evil dispositions that
he is naturally inclined unto, he may also make conjecture what trade of life
is most metest for him. Moreover he shall sone learn thereby, what diet is
profitable, to preserve him in health, and what is contrary to his nature.
Besides these also he may learn thereby to know what diseases he is subject
unto most, and so he may the better prevent them. As for example if a man by
the signs and qualities prescribed, know him self to be of a colericke
cumplexio^, thereby he should have just occasion to bridle his natural
affections, Coloricke men are apt to be Capitaines and Lawiers, but to hoo^e
to be Divines.
and endeavor to eschew rashenes, prodigality, hastines, and soche like. Also
thereby he may know that he is apt to learning, or to be a Lawier, or to be a
Captain, or to do any handie work wherein quickenes of wit, sleighte or
subtlety does consiste without any great labor. Also thereby he may learn
y^ often drinking of hot wynes, or eating of hot spices be noisome to him.
Abou^daunce of sweet meats honey, garlic, and onions, may be but seldom
used of him. He may learn also that his stomach is so good of digestio^ that
almost no groose meat can hurt him. Moreover, thereby he may learn, to know
that he is apt to fall into certian agues, yelowe iaundies, Hot sickenesses
the causes.
phrenesies, vomitinges, and soche like cholerique diseases, which if he will
eschew, he must forbear the things before rehearsed, specially in So^mer, and
the^ also he must learn of much labor and travail, of burning heat of the
Sun, and of great anger, and soch like things that inflame choler. The like
commodities are to be searched out in other complexions, which diligent
observation you may easily find, wherein if they be able to enstructe the
Physician, he may with more safety, and speed, cure their diseases.

The second book treats of diet and food, meet and necessary for the
body of man. And of such herbs as a gardaine ought to be furnished withal,
which be needful in health and sickness.

why man has need of nourishement.
THe natural heat which God has ordained to be in man's body from the time
of his generation until he depart out of this world does continually waste
and consume the substance of the members, (...).
and therefore the whole body would sone be wasted and consumed, unless the
like substance to that which is euaporate and spredde were daily engendered in
the body. Hyp^^r^, de (...).
Therefore nature has engendered even from the birth an appetite, and desire of
meats and drinks in each man, of which meats and drinks received into the
stomach, the same nature by alteration and digestion of them makes such
substance as each member has lost, that the body may long endure in good
estate. This is the marvelous workyng of God and nature for the preservation
of mankind, for we need not to be taught of any body to eat, Deus (...)lo.
drink or breath, but immediately after our generation, we have those faculties
and appetites engraffed in us, whereby we can do them without a teacher. With
meat when it is digested and altered, is restored the dry and sound
substance that is wasted in the members, with drink is restored the moister
substance of the body that is consumed: Cibus, Potus, Air, Hypo^^. de ^^^i.
And so they are both reserved in their former state. By breathing and by
moving of the pulses, the air and the fiery substance of the body, is
nourished and refreshed.

The second Chapter.
Of the commodities and discommodities of meats and drinks.
THe food which is received into the stomach by the mouth, is there boiled
by naturalheate, and the juice thereof is sucked and drawn to the liver by
certain veins called Meseraicae, where it is purified, How Chy^us to br^de.
and the best of it is turned and altered into blood by the virtue of the
liver, How nature is nourished.
and from thence that blood is sent in veins, into all parts of the body,
with which blood each member is nourished and restored, and by the operation of
nature every member has blood turned daily into soche substance as the
member is, whereby so much is restored to that member as natural heat before
has wasted and consumed. Soch be the commodities of meats and drinks if they
be good and easy to digeste being taken in sufficient quantity, good order
and due time. How the nutramentes ar infected.
But if these circumstaunces be not observed, there is scarcely any thing so
pernicious to a man. For so they be of great force, to engender grievous
sicnesses, by engendring evil and vicious humors. These circumstaunces
therefore aforenamed, are diligently to be considered and observed of soche, as
desire to keep their bodies in health. What, when, and at what time meat must
be taken.
First what they eat or drink. Secondly how much. Thirdli after what sort:
And last of all at what time.

For the first part, there ought head to be taken, that the meats and drinks
which are to be received into the stomach, be good and wholesome for the body.
And therefore they must be soche as will cause good iuyse, and engender good
blood, and soche as the stomach is well able to digeste: Beef is better then
a chiken to a cholorike body.
For some stomach is more able of nature to digeste hard meats then many
other. But note that the best and most wholesome meats, ought to have these
properties. They must breed good juice, they must be light and easy of
digestion, and they must be of a thin substance: for soche do breed good
humors in short time, without any obstructions and stoppinges of the veins,
and conduictes of the body. As for those meats that are of contrary
qualities to them aforesaid: they are hurtful and noisome to the body. For
soche meats as be of evil juice, do engender naughty and corrupt humors in
the body. Soche as be hard of digestio^, do debilitate and make weary
nature, ouercharging the alteratiue virtue of the stomach. The nourishmentes of
^iuill food.
Soche as be of a gross substance, do bread obstructions and opilations,
stopping the vessels that be about the liver, whereby for lack of free
passage of blood, and other humors, perilous fevers, and many other dangerous
diseases be engendered. Moreover, it is to be noted in this part, which teached
to observe what you eat or drink, that the temperature of meats is to be
marked and learned. For as long as a man is in health, Food for healthful
bodies.
soche meats as are of like temperature to him self, are most wholesome for
him and best, agreing to his nature. For this is a general rule and precepte
in physic, Similia similibus nutriuntur, that is as much to say, as things
that are like are nourished by their like. And therefore hot meats are good to
nourish hot complexions, cold meats are good for cold complexions, dry for
dry, likewise: and moiste meats good for moist complexions. The second thing
which was said, The quantity of meats.
ought to be observed in receiving food, was to take heed how much is received
at one meal. Whosoever therefore entendeth to preserve him self in health, let
him take heed that he do not use to eat vsque ad sacietatem, that is as
long as he has any appetite, Glotonie, the fruits thereof
or until he be stuffed full: for excess of meats does ouercharge nature,
suffocating and quenching natural heat, so that some disease immediately
insueth, observe therefore in any case to be content with so much meat as
will suffice nature, thin king it sufficient to have hunger slaked, although the
appetite be not fully satisfied. This is a precepte most worthy to be
observed of them that would prolong health, which thing is confirmed by a
notable sentence, of the most ancient famous, and excellent physician
Hypocrates, which is worthy to be borne in mind of all men. And it is this
in latin, Sanitatis studium est non satiari cibis* that is to say: The means
to preserve health, is to eschew sacietie and gluttony of meats and drinks.
The way to keep health.
Thirdly, there ought to be an order observed in eating of meats: for albeit
that it is most wholesome for all complexions, to eat of one kind of meat
only at one meal, (for so nature is able to make more perfect digestion
thereof) yet because the greatest sort of men (specially if they be
wealthy) do commonly use to eat of sundry meats at one meal, I thought
it worthy of obseruacion, that there be not a preposterous order used in
eating of diverse meats: Diverse meats at one meal are not wholesome.
for so diversity of meats might infer greater danger. Observe therefore
to eat co^pitentely of one meat only at one meal, and let it be soche as
will well agree to your complexion, and soche as you have been accustomed unto.
If any refuse to observe this receipte, let them for the eschewinge of greater
danger, observe and take heed that in diuersitee of meats, they use to eat
soche things as be easy of digestio^, before meats that be of hard
digestio^, S^dden before roste.
and let them eat moiste meats before dry meats, and mollifiyng meats
before binding and restrictiue meats. For if this order be observed, there
will less hurt ensue. Note this.
Last of all, it is not to be neglected at what times meats and drinks are to
be received into the stomach. For food received out of due time, does rather
hurt then nourishe, for the knowledge whereof there are five things to be
considered. The age, the time of year, the complexion, the country, and the
custom. Age, Time, Complexion Region and custom.
As for example, a child or a young man, until he be past.xx. years of age,
in winter or springtime, being Choleric or Sanguine of complexion, dwelling in
a cold region, and having used to eat often: soche a one ought to feed
often. But contrariwise, a man that is past.xxx. years of age. in Summer and
harvest time, being flegmatike or Melancolike of complexio^, dwelling in a hot
region, and accustomed to eat but seldom, soche a one ought to feed seldom.
The hotter the body is, the sooner do meat digest.
Also these aforesaied respects, being severally considered, do partly
declare the times of eating. For a child may eat more oftener then any other
age. A choleric complexion oftener the^ any other complexio^. Likewise in
winter, a man that is in health, may eat oftener then in Summer. And so
forth, is to be understood of the rest. And the contrary of the contraries.
In Winter heat is drawn to the inward parts.
But note generally that it is good for the preservation of health, if those
which be in health, do not use to eat meat before that the meat which
they did eat last, before be digested, having exercised their bodies with some
pastime or labor, and then as soon as hunger and appetite provoke them, let
them eat competently. I think it be most wholesome for them that lead a
quiet and idle life [excepte they be choleric of complexion] to be content
with two meals in one day, that is dinner and supper. And let there be vij.
or viij. hours, Time between meals.
between meals, and let them eschew by all means possible, drinking or
banqueting between meals. But soche as use daily great bodily labor, or
that exercise themselfes much in any pastime or travail, or that be of a
choeerick complexion, soche persons sins the coldness of our country, and also
custom do permit it. Complexion and region observed.
They may safely use to eat three meals a day, that is, breakefast, dynner,
and supper, so that there be five or six hours between either of them. But
let them observe that their chief labor and exercise be before meat, Note
this.
for labor or exercise after meats, is very hurtful to the body, for because
it makes abundance of crude and raw humors in the veins and conduites of
the body.

The.iii. Chapter.
Of diversities of meats.
IT is most certainly confirmed by the authority of ancient phisicions, and
proved also by daily experience, Gal. de hu^^^ribus.
that humors ar bredde in man's body, as the juice of the meat that he
receives is apt to make. It is true, yt evil meats will make evil juice:
eue^ so good meats to the body full of foul humers do turn to the worse
part. For the serpente and the Be sucketh Honey and poison, both of one
herb.
And therefore there ought no little regard to be had, what kind of food is to
be used. For as meats of good iuyse do engender good blood, and preserve
health, so contrariwise soch meats as bread ill iuyse, do engendre vicious
and corrupt humors, and do cause diverse and many perilous diseases. Note
therefore that of meats, some be easy of digestion, and some hard of
digestion. And of either of them some be of good juice, and some of evil
juice. Also some meats be apt to breed melancholy, some fleme, and some
choler. Of which it would require long time to make particular rehearsal. I
will only in the chapters following brieflye declare which meats are
accoumpted to make good juice, which make evil juice, and which are in a
mean between them both.

The.iiii. Chapter.
Of meats making good juice.
THese meats followinge, are easy of digestion, and are wo^te to make good
juice in a hail body, that is to say: partriches, Fesantes, Meats best for
tenderlynges.
Chickens, Capons, Hens, Small birds that use to be upon mountains, new
laid eggs, rear or potched, young porke, veale, new milk, fresh fish
that be in grauellie and stony rivers. Note also milk is hurtful to them,
which have a Fever, as Hypocrates affirms, Lac capud dolentibus malum*
To these may be added bread made of the flower of good wheat, being well
leauened, sufficiently salted, and well baken in an oven, being two or three
days old. And also pure wine. These with many other things which for
brevity I leave out if they be taken in mean quantity in due order and time,
they enge^der good blood, and nourishe the body quickly.

The.v. Chapter.
Of meats engendring corrupt humors, because they be of ill juice.
THese meats following are hard of digestion, Like do inge^der the like
and do most commonly make evil juice in a healthful body, (that is)
Bacon made of old swyne, Mentes eiuil for idle people but wholesome for them
that labor.
old biefe, tame Duckes, tame Geese, when they are old, old mutton, puddinges
made of the blood of beasts, tripes, and sowse, hard chese, shell fishes,
unripe fruit eaten raw, raw herbs and soche like. To these may be added
unleavened bread baken under the ashes, and wine that is very new thick, or
sower. These and soche like, do seldom or rather never breed good blood in
any man's body. And therefore it is good to eschew then, although labouryng
men may often use them without any great hurt ensuing, by means of their
great bodily labor and vehement exercises, whereby the hurt that would ensue
is avoided by swette and other excrementes.

The.vi. Chapter.
Of meats which are in a mean.
I Count all soche meats to be in a mean, The mean is best.
between those meats that be rehearsed in the ij. former chapiters which
either be somewhat hard of digestion, but being well digested, do make
indifferent good juice, or else soche meats as do abound with superfluous
humidities and excrementes whereby fleme and viscious humors be engendered. To
these add soche meats as be clammy and do make obstructions and opilations,
and soche other like. Of al these sorts I will rehearse some particular
examples, Meats of the best nutrament and worste.
whereby you may the better consider the remnaunt. Young bief, Mutto^, Kidde,
La^be, Conies, Pigges, all water fowls being young, salt flesh, and fish,
hard eggs, new chese, Cream, Rye bread, Venison, ripe fruits, and diverse
other things of like sort to some of these, which at this present I
pretermitte. Now I will entreat of herbs, which be most used of healthful
folks, and be necessary against diverse diseases.

The.vii. Chapter.
Of a gardeine.
SInce herbs are so diversely and often used of all kind of people in pottage,
brothes, Sallettes, Mathiolus in prol. Dioscoridi.
and sauses. And be also found by long experience to be most wholesome and
profitable against an infinite number of diseases, I can not but lamente the
wilful folly of those, that neither themselves will have good gardens, and to
plant, and sow good stoore of herbs therein: neither yet do regard the
knowledge of the virtues and operations of soche herbs as are daily in use.
But if their finger do but ache a little, Commodity good cheap.
they covet to have a medicine that is brought out of India, or from the
furthest part of the world. Where as in deed (according to the saying of
Plini) they daily do tread upon soche herbs as be able to remedy many
dieases, but their ignorance causes them to contemn them as weeds, good
for no purpose. And contrariwyse, I count them worthy of great praise and of
continuance of health, which being of ability, will no less endeavor them
selves to have a fair gardein well stored with a great number of good and
wholesome herbs, the^ they will prepare to have a gorgeous house finely
furnished with many necessary impleme^tes since the commodities thereof be so
great. For as a house is a place for a man's rest and ease, wherein he keeps
his gooddes from thieves and robbers, Ab altissimo (...) est medicin^.
even so a garden is a place of pleasure and delight, wherein be herbs that
will keep a man's body from diseases and sickness, if he list to learn their
virtues and qualities, which all men ought to be willing to do, that have any
regard to their health. For at the beginning as it appears in ye first of
Genesis. Almighty God did ordeine herbs and fruits, to be sustinaunce and
food for man: saying unto Adam and Eua, after that he had blessed them in
this wise. Behold, I have given unto you all herbs that bring forth seed
upon the earth, and all fruits of trees, to be meat for you. Here it
appears, that by Gods ordinance, herbs and fruits do suffice to
nourishe and sustain man's nature. As undoubtedly not only Adam and Eve were
nourished by herbs and fruits, but also great multitudes of people in diverse
ages, have been, and at this present be nourished and fed only with herbs,
roots, and fruits. And we our selves although according to the custom of our
progenitors, use to cate flesh and fish of diverse sorts, yet have we
daiely herbs and fruits in use to nourishe our bodies withal, The profit
of a good gardeine.
and to cure such diseases as man's body is subject unto. In consideration
whereof, I wyshe and counsel, as many as be able, to prepare for themselves a
gardaine plotte, and to plant, set, and sow therein, so many sundry herbs
as they can learn to be wholesome and good for their bodies being in health, and
profitable against common diseases, that it may be unto them in steed of a
Poticaries shop, when the Physician shall appointe them by his bil a remedy
which they should make for their grief, or when there is a diet prescribed
them. How to place a garden.
First, therefore whosoever entendeth to have a gardeine, let him chose a
plotte on the Southe side or East side of his house, let the quantity thereof
be according as he shall judge sufficient for his use, let it not be nighe to a
barn, for the dust and chafe of corn destroieth herbs, if you covet to set
your herbs in September about Michelmas time, To trim a garden, both the
manner and time,
then let your ground be plowed or dug in the Spring time, in March or
April, that the heat and drienes of the Summer may make it mellowe. But if
you will begin to gardaine in February or March, let your ground be
ploughed or dug in September or October, that the frostes and cold of the
winter may make the earth mete for your purpose, lay compass upon the
ground a month before you will set or sow any thing, and let it be
horse dunge or shepes du^ge, and let it be delued into the ground a week
before you sow any seed, or set any herbs, let your ground be suerly
and closely fensed with a wall or a pale, or a double quick set hedge, that no
cattle nor pultrie can come into it. Provide that there be continually water
nighe the gardain plotte, To water your garden.
which thing if you would be sure of, dig a well in August, for that will
not be destitute of water al ye year. When your ground is ready, then set
and sow, herbs and seeds, the Moon being in the increase, that is between
ye change and the full, Wha^ to sow your seeds.
and let the Moon be in one of these signs: Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn,
which you may learn to know in the end of this treatise.

The first Chapter.
Of herbs growyng without man's labor in sowyng or plantinge them.
I Have declared before what herbs are mete for a gardein, and what virtues
they have, not being ignorant but that I have omitted many herbs which be
hard to get and be but little known, and therefore I omitted them, being
content to name the most common herbs that be in diverse gardens, which may
suffice the ignorant people. But besides the herbs that are planted in
gardens, there ar diverse herbs that grow of their own accord in ye
fields, which have notable virtues for sundry diseases. And therefore I would
wyshe all men and women to do their endeavor, to know the^ and learn their
virtues. Now in this place I will rehearse the names of certain herbs of the
field that be most common: more of their virtues and properties, for brevity
I let pass until an other time.

Hitherto I have declared the names of those herbs, which among all other I
would wish were well known of the common people, that by the^ they might the
easilier get remedy, and help of their griefs and sicknesses, without any
great cost or travail.

The.xi. Chapter.
A declaracion of sickness and health.
I Think it were superfluous to declare, that health is profitable and
pleasant to al men, since each man daily does wish and pray, either for
the restitucion, or for the continuau^ce of the same. But I suppose it be
nedeful to declare, what health is, and wherein it consists, that thereby the
ignorant may learn to know when they are in perfect health, and when they
be inclined to sickness. Note therefore, that health is a natural affeccion
and state of the body, wherein each member is able to do that office and
accion, that nature has ordained it for, partly, as the stomach to digeste
perfectly, and to have good appetite. Note this.
etc. Note also, that this natural state does remain so long in each member,
as it keeps the natural temperature, that it should have, in heat, cold,
moistnes and drines: and also has the same form, quantity, number, and place,
that nature has ordained it to have. If these things be present to each
member of the body, then is the hole body in perfect health. Except some
external cause does hinder it, as a wound, prick, brouse, or some soche
like outward euente, which do deminishe health, and cause some sickness.
Note therefore, that sickness is contrary to health, and therefore it is not
hard to know what sickness is, and wherein it does consiste. Howbeeit, I
will declare somewhat of it, that it may be the more plainlier understood of
all men.

Sickness is an unnatural affeccion and state of the body, wherein some
member is hindered and let, that it can not perfectly fulfill that office and
action, that nature has ordained it to do: as when the stomach does loathe
meat, or can not keep it til it be digested. etc And note that this unnatural
affeccion of the body, Distemperaunce.
does consiste in the members of the body, Evil form.
three diverse ways, for either it comes by distempure of some member, so
that it is hotter, colder, moister, or drier, then it should be of nature: Or
else by indecent fashion, quantity, number, or place of some member.

Or last of all, by solucion Solucion.
and disheuering of some parts, by ulcers, impostumes, wounds, or soche like:
which parts were ordained by nature to be joined together, and therefore the
separacion of them is a disease. These be the diversities of diseases, which
when they chance in man's body: there is a strief and battaill, between
nature and them, which shall overcome other. And if sickness overcome nature,
then does death ensue: but if nature do overcome the sickness, then the
body by little and little, is restored to health again. And note that in this
combare, between the disease and nature, the Physician is as it were a minister
and aider to nature, to help her to overcome the disease, by soche means as
the art of Physic does teach him, may best be done: For there are
sondrie kinds of aides, which are to be sought out by this means. First, it
is to be noted, that this is a most generalle precepte in Physic:
Contraries do cure their contraries.
Contraria contrarijs curantur, that is, diseases are cured by their
contraries, and therefore, if the disease be a distempure of hot, cold,
moiste, or dry, whereby any part of the body is altered from his natural
state, then to help nature against that distempure, you must apply or minister
a medicine, that is contrary to it, that is, a cold medicine to a hot
disease, a hot medicine to a cold disease, a dry medicine to a moiste
disease. And this must be dooen with diligente obseruacion, or else there is
danger in it, rather then profit. As for an example. If a little distempure
of heat should happen to a member of the body, there might be applied so
cold a medicine to it, that would alter the member into a greater diste^pure
of cold, then the heat was. Note therefore, that the temperature of each
member, must be learned and considered, when it is in health, and then the
distempure must diligently be noted, how much it diffreth from the said
temperature, for so much must the medicine differ on the contrary part. As
for example. If a member were distempured, that it were two degrees hotter
then it was being in health, then must the medicine be two degrees colder,
then the temperature of the member was. And so by that means, the two cold
degrees of the medicine, will destroy and quench the two hot degrees of
distempure, and will bring the member again into his natural temperature. Thus
(...) a due proportion diligently to be considered always between the disease
and the medicine, or else there will rather hard then good ensue. But (...) a
disease be caused by abundance of humors in the body, which (...) to
oppress nature, then the physician helps nature by taking away some part of
the aboundau^ce of those (...) humors, whereby nature is the (...) able to
overcome y^ (...) in short time. And note that this taking away of humors is
dooen diuersely, according as occasion best serves: Sometime by setting of
(...), sometime by purgacion, or vomit: and sometime by provoking of sweat,
or otherwise, these and soche like are sometime the doings of the Physician,
wherewith he helps nature, against the disease of repleacion; in which the
former rule is observed. That is, to heal by co^traries, for euacuacion and
pourgyng, be contrary to repleacion and fulness of humors. But in dooyng of
these things, there ought diligent heed to be taken, that they be attempted
in a convenient time: and that they be dooen with good measure, that is not to
little, nor to much. And further consider where, how, and with what you were
best to work that nature may thereby receive more commodity then
hinderaunce: When the Phisici^^, and how the Physician should minister.
Here therefore, the help of a skillful and circumspecte Physician is most
requisite, for if euacuacion by pourging, bloodlettyng, sweatyng, or otherwise,
be dooen out of time, out of measure, or contrary to that which is requisite,
as if you do pourge, when bloodletting is only necessary, then is the
disease aided against nature, whereby greater danger of death does ensue,
then would have dooen, if nature had been let a lone. But to conclude briefly,
note, that in all diseases the duty of the Physician is, to use the contrary
remedy to the disease, that health may be restored, as to take away that,
which is superfluous, and to add to that, which lacks, to soften
hardness, and to rarifie grossenes, and contrariwise, always endeuouryng to
recover the natural state of the member diseased. Likewise in hollow ulcers
and wounds, to cause f^leshe to grow, and to set in again bones that are out
of joint, and soche other like: always addyng, subtractyng, or amondyng that
which is wantyng, haboundyng, or out of his dew form and place.

The. xii. Chapter.
What things the Physician ought to know before be attempt the cure of any
disease.
I Have declared sufficiently in the former Chapter, how that it is the
property of nature only, to strive and fight against diseases. The Physician
is but a scruaunte.
And how that the Phisicio^ is but the minister, and servant of nature, either
to add soche things to her, as she may use to destroy the disease withal,
or else by pluckyng clean away, the greatesse part of that matter, which
causes and maintains the sickness. And therefore it is mete and necessary
for the Phisicio^ before he minister any thing, to learn and search out
perfectly, the cause of the disease, in which if he be ignoraunte, it is more
by good fortune then by cunnyng, that he cures any disease. For, how is it
possible to help nature with that, that she has need of, except it be first
known what she needs, which none can know, except the cause of the
disease be manifest to him, so that he may minister things directly,
contrary to the cause of the disease. And therefore I can not but lamente the
ignorance of the common people, that are persuaded, that one medicin is
sufficient for one disease, not considering that one disease may come of
sondrie causes. And therefore it necessarily requires diverse medicines As
for example, weakness of the stomach, that it cannot digest well, or that it
has no good appetite, is one disease, which nevertheless may be caused a
dosen sundry ways, therefore the cure of it can not be always with one
medicine, but rather in each cause with a sundry medicine. As if weakness of
the stomach come of a cold diste^pure of it self only, then it must be made
hot bosom means. If heat causes the weakness then it must be cooled.
Likewise you must moisten drines, Ex pituita oritu^ sanguis.
and dry moisture. But if the weakness be caused of some humor that does
abound which has flowed into the stomach, or has been there engendered,
then must that superfluous humor be pourged out, either by vomit or
purgation, with a meke medicine. As if it be fleme, with a medicine that
expels fleme, if choler be abounding there, then must it be soche a medicine
as pourgeth choler. And likewise for Melancholy, a mete purgatio^ must be used
to draw out the humor. But if the imbecillitie of the stomach be caused by a
distilation and rewme that falls out of the head into it, then is the cure to
be wrought in the head, and not at all in the stomach. And likewise if
distempure of the liver or spleen, do weaken the stomach, the cure consists
in healing those members, and not in ministering any thing for the stomach, for
it will be well as soon as they are cured. Thus it is declared at large in one
example the diversity of causes in one disease, that thereby all men might
likewise consider that every disease in each member of the body may and does
likewise come of diverse causes, against which causes if the medicines be not
directly ministered, it avails nothing, but rather hurts,

Therefore let no man think it sufficient for the Physician, if he know that
a man has soche a disease: as the ague, the Colicke, the Flixe, or soch other
like, that then he may straightwaye (if he be conning) minister a medicine mete
for it. Find forth the cause, tha^ the medicine.
No, not so, but he must first search by all means possible the very cause of
the disease, which the ignorant people have long time been persuaded, that a
cunning Physician may do in all diseases, by the only fight and inspection
of the urine. Stereus et vrinae medicorum fercula prima.
But alas, they are craftily bewitched or couetously blinded. For to come to
the knowledge of the cause of some inward disease, the urine profits nothing.
And in most inward diseases of the body, there ought as good regard to be
had to the pulse, and to the disposicions and state of the brain of the sick,
as there should be of the vrin. Also the egestions, sweat, spettle, and other
excreme^tes are not to be neclected, in so much as at some time, they do
declare the cause of the disease, and the state thereof, when the urine shows
nothing at all. As for example. Signa pleuritidis
In a pleurisy, or in an inflamacion of the lunges, or in a squinancie, or
soche like. There is more to be known by spittle, then by Urine, likewise in a
laxe, or in a bloody flixe, or in a Colike, or Iliacke, there is more
certainty of judgment to be given by egestion or ordure, then is by urine:
which things those that be not altogether addicte, so their own fantasy,
may quickly by good reason, Vrina non est nisi sanguinis excremenium and are
^ibus attractu at (...) hanc per vrinarios meatus in v^uieam delatum.
be persuaded to credit. For Urine is nothing else but the watrie and whaishe
part of the blood: for it is strained from blood in the Liver, and sucked from
thense into the raines, from whens it distilleth down into the bladder, and so
passes forth. Since therefore, urine is the excremente that is separate from
blood: there is good cause why it should show the estate of the liver, and of
blood in all parts of the body. And also it can well declare the estate of
soche members as it passes by, as of the raines, the blader, and soche like.
But certainly in other diseases that be out of the veins, and be distaunt
from the places, by which the vrin passes, there is no certain judgment to
be given by the urine, unless the vehemency of the disease, has infected
the blood or liver, after some sort Nevertheless, soche is the ignorance of
the common people, that they think him worthy of no estimacio^ in Physic,
which can not at the first sight of the vrin (although it has been carried.xx.
miles) tell whether it be a man's water, or a woma^nes, and how the disease
greueth the paciente, better then himself, and also whether he shall live or
die, what disease so ever it be, which things undoubtedly, in diverse
diseases are impossible, to be told by the only sight of the urine. And
therefore it is thought meet for him, that will minister Physic duly and
rightfullie: First to se the pacient and to talk with him or her, Vsus pulsus.
whether it be. Then to feel the pulse, and to observe well the state thereof:
next to view diligently the excrementes, not only the urine, but also the
ordure, spitell and sweat. Last of all, to have respect to the place where
grief is, and to consider the accidents that rise thereof, not omitting to
know the former diete, and trade of life of the sick. These things then
being diligently and severally marked, the Physician may more certainly
learn the cause of the disease, the strength thereof, and to what end it will
come, then he could by seeing the urine only. And by that means he may
minister amete medicine for it, whereby the sick shall sone find ease, Blind
bayarde is boldeste.
and himself great good fame. Otherwise, he might by his error and ignorance,
torment the sick worse, and bring peril of death, to his utter reproach. Thus
have I partly declared, what things ought to be known of the Phisicio^,
that thereby he might with draw and take away, the fond and folishe opinion,
that a great number of the country do credit, to be true (that is) that the
sight of the urine is sufficient enough for a cunning Physician, to know the
disease of the sick, and the cause thereof, and to minister apt medicine for it.

The.xiii. Chapter.
Of the use and commodities of pourging and bloudletting.
MOte that if the body of man do abound with humors, which are ready to
oppress nature, then whether there be sickness in the body present by means of
them, or if there be but danger of sickness, those humors must be euacuate
out of the body, either by bloudletting or by pourging, or by vomit,
swetting, or bathes, or by some other kind of euacuation. But I will speak
here only of euacuation by bloudletting and pourging. And first of
bloudletting. There be diverse things to be considered before bloudletting.
Age. Custom. Complexion.
The age of the patient, the complexion, the time of the year, the region, the
custom, the strength, and the vehemency of the disease. The age must be
considered, because children under 14. years of age, and old folk may not be
let blood without great necessity require it. The complexion is to be noted,
because a hot complexio^ has large veins, and abou^deth with much blood. And
therefore they may forbear a good deal of blood. But cool complexions have
narrow veins and little blood, and therefore their euacuation must be small.
Time.
The time of the year must be marked that the weather be not to hot nor to
cold. And therefore the springtime is most apt time for blood letting,
because it is temperate.

The region and country is rehearsed, Tempus, habitus, regio.
because it is to be noted that if the regio^ be very hot, or very cold, it
is not good to let blood: a temperate region is meatest for it. Custom is not
to be neglected, for thereby we may know that they that have been accustomed to
blede, may better suffer blood letting the^ those that never were letten blood.
The strength of the person must be regarded, for if there be great weakness,
it is very dangerous to let blood at all, except extreme necessitee
compels. Also the veheme^cie of the disease is worthy to be marked: for if
it be a vehement disease, you must let blood straight, if the former
circumstaunces do suffer it.

These things considered, if they will permit blood letting, and if it be in
a necessary cause, it shall be good and expedient to know in what sign the
moon is, for you must take heed that she be not in the sign that governs
that member, Gal. lib. ii. de temp. Cap. v. Malio que abundant sanguine idioque
copiosam ferunt^a^ cuationem.
wherein you entende to open the vain, and also forsee that she be in soche a
sign as is good to let blood in, which the table in the end of this book,
will teach you. The uses and commodities of bloudletting, are as follows.
First, this is a general rule, that bloudletting is a very good and most
convenient remedy for all diseases that be engendered of abundance, flowing
or eruption of blood, as be chiefly the fevers called Synochi. Also the
phrenesie, squinancie, pleurisi, peripneumony, opthalmie, and against al
inflammations, and impostumations, engendered of blood in the liver, the spleen,
the raynes, the womb, the share, the armeholes, the arms, the legs: to
conclude in all inward or outward parts, wheresoever the inflammation be,
bloudletting is good for it, whether it be now present, or that there be
danger that it will shortly engender. Also bloudletting is good in fevers,
whether they be continual or intermittent, if so be the obstructions and
stoppinges of the veins, be caused of immoderate repletion of humors.

And note that bloudletting, does empty and enuacuate from the body, all
humors alike, as well good as bad. And therefore it is chiefly to be used,
Great abosida^ce in blood requires to open a vain.
when there is to great an abundance in the body of blood and other humors,
which do strain and stuff the veins, that there is a great danger and
ieoperdie and breaking of some vain, or bruysing out of some flure of blood or
of choking, and ertinguish natural heat. And therefore in soche cases you must
let blood with all speed, although sickness be not already present. For by
lettinge blood in due season, the superfluous fulness of y^ veins, is brought
into a mean state again, the pains that came of fulness and stretching of the
vessels be eased: The heaviness that was felt in the body is taken away, and
the body is lightened, and made more quick and nimble to do all soche
actions as nature has ordained it to do. Also it causes natural heat to have
a larger scope, and a free passage by opening and emptiyng the straightwayes
and passages of the veins and arteries. Last of all if it be done in time, it
preuenteth diseases, into the which the body was ready to have fallen.

Many more commodities might here be rehearsed of bloudletting, Much profit in
blood lettyng.
which is done when it ought, and as it ought to be done, but to conclude
(omitting all other) note for a general rule, that blood letting is good
against all kind of diseases which be caused and engendered of blood, not
only when the diseases ar present, but also it is good letting blood to
preuente any soche diseases if they be forseen or feared, always obseruinge
that there be none of these impedime^tes aforesaid, which prohibit and
forbid blood letting, except it be in great necessity and extremity, for
then as the proverb is, Necessitas non habet lege^, that is: necessity has
no law.

Here would I leave of to speak of bloudletting, but that there comes to my
mind the common opinion of the ignorante people, which do certainly believe
that if any person be let blood one year, he must be let blood likewise
every year, A good note.
or else he is in (I can not tell) how great danger, which fond opinion of
theirs, whereof soever it sprung at the first, is no more like to be true,
then I should say, when a man has a great wound by chance in any part of
his body, whereby he loses much blood, after it is healed he must needs have
the like wound again the next year to avoid as much blood, or else he is in
danger of great sickness or of death. Which opinion if I did affirm it to
be true (although it be most false) yet I might use the like reason and
autoritee to defend it, that the common people use for theirs: for they can
say nothing if they be asked why they think so, but that they have heard
many say so. Therefore I would wish that no man should credit any longer
this foolish opinion, being most false, onle she can show good reason for
it, which I am sure no man can do. Mary this I think that like as blood
letting is not good against al diseases, so also it is not good in all
persons, but only in those that will be content to use afterward a moderate,
Quando sangu^^ vehementer as bundat*
and convenient diet. Those therefore that do abound with blood and will be
let blood to preserve themselfes from the danger of any disease, that is like
shortly to ensue and moleste them. They must longtime after be content to use
a moderate and convenient diet, for those which be intemperate and gluttonous
in meats or great drinkers, and wine bibbers, they do not only receive no
commodity at all by blood lotting, but also often times they catch more hurt
by it then they should have had without it, for in three or four days space
after, they fill and stuff them selves with more raw iuyces and humors, (by
means of unmeasurable diet) then they had before, and often times they dye
through conuulcion. Si ebrius quispia^ repent obmutuerit conuulsus moritur.
And therefore note that there is soche force and virtue in moderate diete to
eschew and decline diseases, that without the observation of it, bloudletting
is to no purpose. And therefore if the common saying of the people be true in
any body, that they must be let blood often, if they be ones let blood, it is
only true in soche as keep an immoderate diet straight after blood letting,
and therefore I counsel all men to beware of excess in eating and drinking
after blood lettyng. Also note yt after blood letting, none ought to walk
apace or to run, or to use any vehement exercise, but let him be quiet and
rest him self until his spirits berefreshed and quieted again. Note also,
that none ought to sleep immediately after bloudletting, but let him keep
himself quiet and watch, auoydyng all contention and exercise of body and
mind. About two hours after blood letting, there may a little food be
taken, but let it be soche as will make good juice and nourishe a pace,
within.iiij. hours after blood letting or somewhat before, it may be permitted
to the patient to sleep, so that it be provided for and taken head of, that he
turn him not upon the arm where the vain was opened, nor that he do not
loosen the band, and so let the blood flow out again. Afterward let him
use a straight and sparing diet, daily increasing it by little and little,
until you be come to your accustomed diet.

And note that the morning is the metest time for blood lettyng, Sanguis qu^
tempore (...) tendus.
when every digestio^ is perfectly finished, and the superfluities and
excrementes of each of them avoided out, which must be foreseen that they be
so. Or at the least in a time of necessity the next apt time to let blood is,
when the stomach is somewhat empty, that is, six or eight hours after meat.
Thus much for bloudletting. Now for pourging, whose use and commodities I
promised to declare.

It is to be noted, that every kind of purgation has that secret virtue and
property in it self, that when it is received in a man's body and is provoked
to exercise, the virtue that it has by natural heat laboring to digeste it,
then it draws unto it soche humor as it has power and virtue to pourge. And
therefore a pourgation is an euacuatio^ of vicious and corrupt humors, which
trouble and moleste the body, but not of all corrupt humors alike. For each
pourging medicine does draw unto it one peculier and propre humor, (that is)
either fleme or choler, or melancholy, or waterie humors. Who must be purged,
and how.
And therefore those that be perfectly in health, ought not to take a
purgation, since they do not abound with corrupt humors, wherefore in those
when the medicine finds no soch superfluous humors as it has virtue to
draw, it consumes and wastes the blood and the flesh. And for that cause,
hole folks are not pourged by pourgations, but rather consumed and wasted, for
it is manifest hereby, that pourgations be very perilous to them that be in
perfect health, which thing is testified also of Hippocrates in the.xxxvij.
Aphorism, of his second book, where he says after this sort. Pourge no
hole bodies.
Qui corpore been se habent hos purgare periculosum est, (that is) it is
dangerous pourging of those that be in perfect health. Also be cause each
pourging medicine has virtue to draw one peculier humor, there is good head
to be taken that soche a medicine be ministered as has virtue to draw the
humor abounding, and no other, or else instede of much good which it would do
if it were conveniently ministered, it may contrariwyse do much hurt.
According to the saying of Hipocrates in the last Aphorism of his first
book, in this manner. Si qua lia oportet purgari purgentur, confert, and facile
feruut, Purge none humors but malignaunte to nature.
sicontra, difficulter, that is, if soche things be pourged as ought to be, it
profits, and may easily be suffered, but if it be contrariwyse, it hurts
and may scarsely be borne, wherefore there ought diligent head to be taken in
the receiving of a purgation, that it be ministered by a skillful Physician,
that has certainly found out what humor it is that haboundeth. But alas the
greatest noumber of the common people, do hold an opinion that if they may
have a medicine for a little money, which will provoke them often to the
stool, what humor soever it pourgeth out, they are safe enough: One pourging
medicen do not expulse thabundau^ce of each humor
howebeit, I would wish the^ hereafter always to have in mind this saying of
the most excellent, Physician Hipocrates in the xxiij. Aphorism of the first
book, Deiectionas non multitudine sunt estimande, sed fi talia deijciantur,
qualia conueniunt, that is: egestions are not to be esteemed for their great
quantity, but if soche humors be pourged out as ought to be (that is) soch
vicious and corrupt humors as do abound and be superfluous in man's body.
There be diverse things to be considered of a Physician before he minister
^purgation, as the quality of the humor, the strength of the sick, the age,
the time of the year, and the disease. The quality of the humor is to be
considered, that he may know what kind of humor is to be euacuate, and
pourged out, for it must be only that which troubles the body with
superfluous abou^daunce thereof. Debumeribus ex Galeno and aliis.
As if fleme do abeunde and trouble the body, he must minister a medicen,
which purges fleme, and so likewise for other humors abounding The minister
of medicen ought to have respect to the strength of the sick, for if he be
very weak and feeble, there ought no purgation to be ministered unto him, When
to purge when not.
because all purgations do weaken nanure and diminishe strength, and the
stronger they be, the more they weiken. Let all men therefore beware of vehement
and strong purgatio^s, lest they put their life in hasarde and danger. By the
age of the patient, the Physician is put in mind that children and old men
ought not to receive purgations, except great necessity require it. The time
of the year is not to be neglected, for there be sometimes of the year
wherein purgations ought not to be ministered, as in Somer, What time purging
is very petilous
specially the Dog days, as they are commonly called, during the time that
the Sun is in Leo, for then is nature burnt up and made weak, y^ she is not
able to suffer the force and violence of a purgation, but the Spring time is
most apt for purgations, because it is temperate. Last of al, ye Physician
ought diligently to behold and contemplate the disease, that he knowing what
kind of disease it is, may the better find out of what humor it is caused. As
for example, To a tercian the cause.
if the Physician perceive the disease to be a tertian fever, straightway he
knows that it is caused of abundance of choler, and therefore he must
minister a medicine to pourge choler, and so forth in other diseases.

Note, that it there be none of the impedimentes above named, a purgation is
good to be ministered to all soche as have abundance of evil juice or
corrupt humors in y^ body, for it draws out the humors that does moleste,
and thereby restores the body to his natural estate again. But if a
purgation be rashely ministered, either to one that needs it not, or at an
unmeet time, or that it be soch a medicine as draws not out the humor which
then abounds, Medicines most apt to the paciente.
or if the medicine be vehement and very strong, it will surely put the
pacient in danger of his life. These things therefore ought to be well taken
head of by all men, lest they catch great hurt, when they hope for some
profit. But if a purgation be ministered discretely to him that has need of
it in due time, and by an apt medicine, which is able to draw out the
abounding humor in sufficient quantity, then does the medicine singular
commodities to the body, for it euacuateth and emptieth out all the causes of
diseases and sicknesses, either present or to come, being engendered of any
superfluous or corrupt humor, as be fevers, tertians, quartains, quotidians,
fluxes caused of raw humors or sharp choler, Dropsies, Goutes, Palsies,
Litargies, Preparaitiue before purgacion.
and diverse other. Note that before a purgatio^ be ministered, there ought a
medicine to be taken, which should prepare the body and make it apt to purge,
and therefore it is called a preparatiue, it is given for two caused, either to
divide extenuate, and make them gross and clammy humors, that they may be
ready to Aowe out, when the medicine draws them, or else it is given to open
and vnstoppe the co^duites and vessels of the body, by which ye purgation must
draw the superfluous humor to it. And this is that which Hipocrates does
counsel in the first Aphorism of his second book where he says, Corpora cum
quisque purgare voluerit, oportet fluuia facere, that is, when any man will
pourge the body, he must make it flowing by opening and vnopening the vessels.
Purge in the Morning.
The most mete time to receive a purgation, is the morning, for then are all
the digestions perfectly finished, and the stomach is without meat, there is
heed to be taken, in what sign the Moon is before a purgation be ministered,
for some signs ar good for it, and some are evil, which are declared in the
table before, so that if any man desire to know a mete time for to pourge,
there he may learn it. A purgation must be taken hot, for so it offends the
stomach less, and it will work the sooner. Those that be apt to vomit, and
are offended with the smell of the purgation, How to behave the body in the
time of purging.
let the^ stop their nosethrilles or smell some odoriferous thing in taking
of it. As soon as it is taken it is good to smell to a toste of brown bread
dipped in vinegar, and apply warm clothes to the stomach, and to wash the
mouth straighte after it is taken with odoriferous wine, or to chewe sweet
and pleasant things to take away the horrible taste of y^ medicine, by this
means vomiting shall be eschewed. For i. hours space after the purgation is
taken, let the pacient sit still and keep himself the quiet and without
sleep, that the strength of the medicine may pass to all parts of the body,
if the purgation work slowely, let him walk up and down a good pace if he
can. When it works, in any case there must be head taken that the pacient do
not sleep, for so the operation of the medicine would be stopped. Also in the
time of pourging, immoderate heat and cold are to be eschued, and therefore
a very great fire, and the cold and open air are both hurtful, for the
body must be kept in a temperate heat. What one should do after purging.
After that the purgation is taken, except the stomach be very weak, it is
best not to eat any thing, lest the operation of the medicine should be
hindered. After that the purgacio^ has done working, the pacient must be
nourished with a mean quantity of some broth that will breed good juice, and
be easily digested, and after by little and little, return to his accustomed
diet.

Thus have I as briefly as I could, declared the commodities of blood letting
and pourging, being well and duly ministered and used, and the disco^modities
that will ensue of the^ both if they be at any time misused, wishing al men as
they tender their health and life, to beware of those ignorant persons that
use to open but one kind of vain for all diseases, One medicin helps not
every sickness
and occupy but one kind of purgation against all humors, not considering at
all, the time, the strength, and age of the patient, nor the cause of the
disease, nor any other of the circumstaunces before named, but let them seek
for the counsel and aid of one that is skillful in phisike, and circu^spectt
in his doings. Who can consider what need they have, and what is most mete
to be ministered unto them.

Here follows a Table which teaches to know in what sign the Moon is for
ever.
First, you must know what is Prime or golden number, and with it you must
work after this sort, seek in the calender the day of the month, and
begin at the number right against it, and tell so many dounwarde as you have
days in your mind, then mark that noumber you find there. The Prime.
And seek the Prime of that year, and begin at the noumber that is against
it, and tell so many dounward as the number was that you marked before; and
where that ends, against it you shall find the sign in the which the Moon
is that day: as for example. The golden nombre this present year of our
Lord. 1564. is 7. that I keep in mind all the year. Now if I desire to
know in what sign the Moon is the first day of May, I seek May in the
table, and against it I find the number of 8. And because it is the first day
of the month, I tell no further, with that 8. in my mind, I seek the Prime
which is 7. and against it is 14. which I meddle not withal, but there I
begin and tell dounwarde until I have told 8. which was in my mind before,
To know the Prime.
and there is 21. against which is written Capricorn. And therefore I know
that on the first day of May the Moon is in Capricorn. Likewise if you will
know in what sign the Moon is the 20. day of August this present year,
seek August, and against it you shall find 18. where you must begin to tell
dounwarde to the end. And then from the top dounewarde again until you
have told 20. and so you shall find there 10. which bear in mind. Then go
to 7. the golden number, and beginning at 14. that is against it, tell
dounwarde 10. where you shall find 23. against which you shall find
Aquarius, and therefore be sure, that the twenty day of August the Moon is
in Aquarius. But in the year of our Lord. 1565. wherein the golden number is
8. work likewise, and you shall find, that the Moon is in the last end of
Gemini. And in the year of our Lord. 1566. The Prime being 9. you shall find
by like operation the Moon to be in the first part of Scorpio the same day. So
that this rule is perpetual, and certain, so that you mark well the golden
noumber of the year that you seek for, and then work accordingly as is above
taught, for by the fourmer examples you may with little study be able to seek
out in what sign the Moon is, or was, or shall be, any day of any year
present, past or to come, so that you know what is the Prime or golden number
of that year that you seek.

A Table to know in what Sign the Moon is, for ever.

By this former table, after you have found out in what sign the Moon is in,
When to sow plant. etc.
you may know by the three rows that follow the signs, what time is good to
let blood, to pourge, and to set sow or pla^te, according as the titles on
their heads do declare, so that if you find in what sign the Moon is, and
do find this letter G against it, look what row it is in, for if it be under
the title to let blood, that is a good day to let blood in: If under the title
of pourging, it is good to purge, if under the last style, it is good to
plant, providing if you may, that the Moon be in the increase, (that is) as
long as she is between the chasi^ge past, and the full to come. And where there
be not written any letters, those days ar either evil or but indifferent for
that purpose. (.?.)

By this figure you may know what is the golden number for ever, markyng
diligently that. 7. is Golden number the year of our Lord. 1564.



THis figure of the golden nombre is necessary for the table, wherein is taught
to know in what sign the Moon is in. For by this figure you may know what
is, has been, and shall be golden number for ever. As for example, if you
would know what was golden number the year of our Lord 1560. Then because you
see that in the year of our Lord. 1564. the Prime is 7. mark how many years
be between. 1560. and 1564. and you shall find 4. therefore because it is for
years past, begin at 7. and tell 4. backwards toward ye left hand, and there
you shall find 3. which was prime the year 1560. And if you will look for 7.
years before this present year, you shall find y^ prime was. 19. But if you
would know for any year to come, reckon from 7. toward the right hand, and
so shall you find it, that as 7. is prime for the year of our Lord 1564. so is
8. prime for 1565 and 9. for 1566. and so forth perpetually.

You shall also find in the beginning of this book a Calender, wherein is
declared, the rising and going down of the sun, and the length of the day
and night with the prime, and Dominicall, and saints days, very necessary
for all kind of men, and very plain and easy to understand.
