O yes.
If any Man or Woman, any thing desire,
Let them repair forthwith unto the Crier.
To the tune of the Parrator.
O yes



O yes,
If any man or woman,
in Country or in City,
Can tell where lives Charity
or where abides Pity?
Bring news unto the Crier,
and their reward shall be
The prayers of poor folks every day,
upon the humble knee.
O yes,
If any man has gone
so long unto the Law,
That he has lost his wits,
and is not worth a straw,
That to regaine the saddle,
is glad to loose the horse,
Let them turn down by Beggers-bush
and rest at weeping-crosse.
O yes,
If any man there be,
that loves the crafty Fox,
And yet the mumping Cunny,
will firret with a pox:
Let him come to the Crier,
and for his just reward,
He may dye in an Hospital,
and stink within the Yard.
O yes,
If any loving Wench
does miss her Mayden-head,
And knows not where she lost it,
abroad or in her bed,
Let her come to the Crier,
and pay him for his pain,
And tell the marks of it, and she
shall have it straight again.
O yes,
If there be any Ostler,
has lately lost a Nagge,
By lodgiug in his hay-mowe,
of every Tag and Rag,
And now is forced to pay for it,
let him trust knaves no more:
But now the Steed is stolen, be sure
to shut the stable door.
O yes,
If any Man or Woman,
or Maiden, if she be,
That has by any sudden chance,
lost some small honesty,
Let them come and demand it,
they shall have their desire,
Without telling the marks of it,
or paying of the Crier.
The second Part.
To the same tune.


O yes,
IF any gentle Lady,
in Court or in the City*
Has lost all her Complexion,
the Crier in mere pity,
Has got a box of beauty,
the like was never seen,
Fu^l of the purest Red and White,
to cover black or green.
O yes,
If any gallant Squires,
who near their bodies spare,
In any great hot service,
have strangely lost their hair,
Let them come to the Crier,
and straight he will them fit,
With curled locks which like the^ best
to cover all their wit.
O yes,
If there be any Cutpurse,
that the last market day
By chance did cut a Purse that went
unwillingly astray,
With twenty Pounds in money,
let him forthwith appear.
And if he chance to escape the rope,
he shall have whipping cheer.
O yes,
If there he any Woman.
the which has lost her tongue,
To help her to recover it,
would do her husband wrong:
For thus the good man wishes,
if that she be a scold,
With all his heart that she might take
an everlasting could.
O yes,
If there is any man or woman,
that can directly tell
Where Is any Petty fogger,
that takes no bribes, does dwell,
Bring word unto the Crier,
he shall be paid therefore,
For he will never plead aright
the causes of the poor.
O yes,
Or is there any here
can tell me any news,
Where dwells an honest Broker,
that never will refuse
To take ten in the hundred,
of such a one I pray*
Bring word to me. I am his friend
a twelve month and a day.
O yes,
If there be any man
hoth lately lost his Wife,
Who never since she saw fifteen,
did lead an honest life;
Let him three market days
expect to see his evil,
Or mounted in a Cart, or else
she is gone unto the devil.
O yes,
If there be any Less
that will her skill engage.
To find a sucking Infant left,
of twenty years of age;
And let her bring him home,
she shall be welly paid,
And have her praises pricked, and pricked,
and sent away no Maid.
FINIS.
