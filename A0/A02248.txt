The castle of labor.




Here begins the prologe of this present treatise
YE mortal people that desire to obtain
Eternal bliss by your labor dylygent
With mortal riches subdue you to pain
To read this treatise to the right intent
Which shall show you plain and euydent
That ydelnes mother of all aduersyte
Her subjects brings to extreme pouerte
The rich by ydelnes to pouerte are brought
By it the orator leseth his science
The great clerk by it is set at naught
Thus is it enemy unto sapyence
Wherefore let us do our dylygence
This leude capytayne fro us to exyle
Which naught entendeth but man to begyle
Ydell people ever troubled are with thought
With indygence mysauenture and necessyte
And in the snare when they are cought
They are enuyroned with pouerte
Than comes dysconfort in their aduersyte
And also dyspayre them does manace
And thought and trouble ever does them chase
Therefore ye people that be subject to this vice
By your great sleuthe and negligence
Break your bonds / I advise you to arise
And to these words give your aduertence
Which the wise man says in brief sentence
Who labors not to get his living
Is no worthy here to have abiding
Thus when this vice a man does assail
Of sleuthsulnes and of ocyosyte
By their means does riches fail
What follows than but pouerte
Thus tourneth his welthe unto aduersyte
So of his folly does he repent
Than echone to him does iniurye
Which often to us appears euydent
Therefore to us it is right profitable
For to take reason for to be our gyde
With vnderstoudynge / which are agreeable
Us for to govern in every tide
Whereby we may / if sleuthe be set aside
Overcome pouerte and obtain richesse
And dystroy thought mysfortune and dystresse
But man's mind is full unsteadfast
More prone to vice than to goodlynesse
And when by vice man thus is ouercast
Than comes dysceyte / vsurye and falsnesse
Counseylynge man all to vnthreftynesse
Thus if that reason be not our friend and gyde
Truth shall decay by falshode and pride
But who would live in mean moderate
And by way of dylygence richesse purchase
Good will must he have to be his advocate
With a good heart / for therein is solace
Intencyon to good must we purchase
And than may we live between hye and low
By such mean that our friends may us know
In this life can none have skarsnesse
While that reason is his protector
If he in labourynge take pain and business
Auoydinge sleuth that blind governor
Which man assayleth every day and hour
Whereby are many brought to dystresse
But dylygence brings man to richesse
By which richesse man comes to nobleness
Which to virtue is as chyef nouryse
Therefore leave we sleuth drawing to business
Enclynynge to virtue and leuynge couetyse
Thus is it good to each that is wise
Remembrynge how sone he shall have an end
In troth and virtue his short time to spend
Thus in conclusyon who redeth this treatise
To the rude langage give none aduertence
It is but written the time to exercise
Without study / pain / or dylygence
With style inornate / void of eloquence
Expressing the ways of dylygence and ydelnesse
The one of pouerte the other of richesse
Thus ends the prologue and be gynneth the castle of labor.


IN musing an eueny^ge with me was none
An old proverb came in me subuenau^ce
A natural fool in a house alone
Will make for himself shyft or cheuysau^ce
Than came in to my remembrance
A cyrcunspect of many dygnytees
Fro which a man having suffysaunce
Withdraws his heart as fro vanytees
It is ay seen that youths lustynesse
For to subdue is hard and dangerous
Some live in joy / pleasure and gladness
Fortune to some is right contraryous
Some death tacheth in their estate prosperous
Whom he overthrows with his mortal blast
Thus goes the world / none is so eurous
But other must he dye first or last
A young heart is unstable and volage
And knows not in what estate to bide
Sometime dysposed unto marriage
Sometime to serve god the world set aside
Thus as my mind varyenge did glyde
I thought it most for mine advantage
Desiring god for to be my gyde
Fermely I concluded upon marriage
Thus having all my friends at assent
In short process I puruayed me a wife
Without wysedom / yet was I content
To her to keep the days of my life
I thought no thing on winning loss or strife
She unto me lightly did consent
Than in an evening sad and pensyfe
By her lyenge simple of mine intent
pouertye

necessyte

Dystresse

Need.



Sodanly I was in great danger
For to me fyersly did appear
An odyous man / an unknown stranger
With three women cruel of manner
This company to me approached nere
When that I them together saw assemble
So cruel was their countenance and chere
That fere constrained my body for to tremble
The man was mysshapen / pale / and rusty
Rude / foul / and right abhomynable
The women also as I could spy
Of shape were foul and detestable
Their chere was ill and miserable
With contenaunce replenysshed with ire
Lene as any wolf rauysable
Their eyes brennynge as read as fire
The man approached fyers as he woldefyght
With staring eyes / and said his name was need
His wife said necessyte she hight
The second pouerte / and the third in deed
Her named dystresse so thought I by her wede
Than I desired to know their lynage
Pouerte was their mother full of dread
This told they me in bryef langage
Touching their fader they could not deny
But that he dwelt in the depest pyt of hell
When I that hard right sore aferde was I
Than need approached with countenance cruel
Mine body streynynge so that it did swell
Necessyte me so sore did handle
So that sothly it seemed right well
Or that she went she would me strangle
Than suddenly came pouerte
Which me tourmented with rudeness
Than with great crudelyte
Upon my belly lept dystresse
They all abounded in cruelnesse
On me smiting with all their might
Dysgorgynge fire in their fyersnesse
Upon me as a torche light
Some at me foyned / some smote down right
That the strokes loud did redounde
For all my pain / during that night
My wife ever slept still and sound
She in her pleasure did habounde
And would not wake for my disease
For if I were brought to the ground
I trow she cared not a pease
thought



AS she thus slept and I in pain
With these four fures did endure
To me approach I saw certain
A foul and counterfayted creature
Odyous / proud / and fyers I you ensure
And by the hand she took me fast
She thought her purpose to procure
And drew mine arms that they nere brast
This false witch me so did grieve
Which by her name was called thought
That uneath could I me remeue
Thus unto death she me nere brought
Of words and tales she wanted naught
Ever she talked I wot not what
And behind her a vylayne cought
That was as blereyed as a cat
heaviness



Being in this perturbacyon
This chorle on me gaped full wide
I fered sore his entencyon
When that I saw him by my side
He looked as he had been fryde
Of shape and color was he full vile
Than he began with me to chyde
In his langage which was subtyle
Upon my belly he set his knees
And said his name was heaviness
With scarled bordred were his eyes
Balde and full of vnlustynesse
He seemed fader of all vnthryftnesse
Iagged and guarded full vngay
With a race filled with falsnesse
Berded like to a kytlynge of may
Him to behold I was dysmayed
How he of things past did clatter
Many a new tale to me he said
He had well learned for to patter
Of things to come fast did he chatter
Bidding me call them to remembrance
He list no thing with me to flatter
But put me to extreme vttraunce
He bad I should remember my dettys
And brought me forth my countynge book
He showed me there of my receptes
And me compelled thereon to look
By fere constrained me body quoke
That power was past me for to speak
That rybaude fered me with his look
That confort to me could I none take
Of his tourment what should I say
I never was in such encumbraunce
He bode still and went not away
And did me much more greuaunce
Than all the other by their noysaunce
And turned me fro side to side
To sleep he left me no suffraunce
But fyresly still at me did chyde
This false caytyf by his cruelnesse
Troubled me that my wit was gone
He put me in so great dystresse
That my heart was cold as any stone
I knew not to whom me for to moan
So was I enuyroned round about
They me tourmented so echone
That of my life I had great dout
Than round about me did I look
First of all same I pouerte
And falls need by the berde me shoke
There were dystresse and necessyte
Thought was in their company
And heaviness did clater fast
All these sir so laid at me
That fro my bed they me nere cast
Than as I did my head remeue
About me lokynge for confort
I saw one come / which did me grieve
More than all the other sort
He said his name was dysconfort
Of color was he pale and wan
It naught auayled him to exhort
I saw never such an other man
Disconfort



By the hand fast he me took
And with great might did m constrayne
Full sore me by the berde he shoke
This these renewed all my pain
His encumbraunce wasted my brain
That often I wysshed that I were deed
He would him self no thing refrain
But kept me still fast by the head
In froward imaginacyon
Dysconforte kept me a long space
He bad me in conclusyon
To sue to him after his grace
Saying that the time and space
Ones lost could not recovered be
With such terms did he me manase
Than in conclusyon thus said he
A poor man how shall thou pay
All thy dettes that are behind
Bread and drink must thou puruay
And a house to keep the fro the wind
Both men and maidens must thou find
With every thing that longs them to
Does not fortune strongly the bind
Now let se how thou can do
What I this hard I was nere mad
And often fortune cursed I
The special cause why I was sad
Was for my purse was clean empty
Than was it need I did espy
My gown to pledge unto one
I saw there was no remedy
Though that I had but that alone
O blessed jesus what may this be
Married was I in an evil chance
To live in such pouerte
As I this said the same instaunce
Came to me Despair in cruel ordonaunce
One of the worst of all the sort
She was chyef capytayne of their dance
And daughter unto Dysconfort
Despair

dysconfort.



This Despair did me so assail
That lost was my dyscrecyon
My face began to wax pale
By fere of her cruel vexacyon
So cruel was her perturbacyon
Which on me she did extend
That I thought in conclusyon
Of my self to make an end
I was ready to run here and there
To clymbe up hye and than to fall
By my life set I not an here
By means of this furye infernal
I thought / who needs to his death shall
It is but folly it to prolonge
This is a word said ouerall
He that is drowned may no man hang
And therefore thought I for to do
The worst that either I could or might
To sle my fader and mother also
If I had found them in my sight
Than unto my mind came full right
That I should dye no more but ones
Wherefore dyspayre that wretched wight
Bad me go thereto at ones
I saw well that without labor
I never should should obtain richesse
Fortune thereof is governor
To some she gives with largess
But I have neither more nor less
So that I weary am of my life
Avoid of ioyefull of dystresse
Lo what it is to take a wife
I se dysconfort does me grieve
Despair increases my lang our
That foot ne hand can I remeue
Such is my pain and my dolor
Neither thought I on worship ne honor
On knight squire baron ne lord
My mind was on no thing that hour
But to hang my self with a cord
Or else to lepe in to some river
And there with pain my self to drown
I cared not in what manner
I dyed so that my life were done
Despair made me her champyon
And had me so take in her snare
That suddenly as I fell in suowne
She me nere strangled or I was ware
treason

Despeyre



AS I was in this perturbacyon
I saw a lady pleasant and bright
For to behold her meke fassyon
Sothly it was a pleasant sight
Her caperon with parle was pyght
With precious stones about enlumynynge
Her beauty full face shone as bright
As phoebus does in a may morning
This lady standing me before
In her behauour was meke and lyberall
Good and gracyous to rich and poor
She seemed to me the queen celestyall
A queen excellent I may her call
For she was daughter shortly to say
Unto that meke lord and immortal
The which was borne on Chrystmas day
Sore I desired to know her name
By cause she was of such excellence
She said reason whom none does blame
Than was I right glad of her presence
This noble lady by her dylygence
Approached nere unto my side
Despair anon gate her thens
And dysconfort with her did glyde
All the hole company did avoid
What time reason sat by me thus
It was some wind would me have noyed
Send unto me by might of Eolus
I trow that Pluto / or Neptunus
Or mars chyef forger of battle
Or else helporter Cerberus
Engendered them me to assail
What should I say they fled that tide
Both despair and the other rout
Than was there none with me to chyde
I rysynge up looked round about
Than of no thing was I in doubt
When reason began to speak softly
When she had driven the other out
That her to here great Joy had I
Reason spoke with delyberacyon
Replete with wysedom excellently
So that sothly in conclusyon
She seemed an oratoure wytty
What she said was said plainly
To the understanding of every man
And sitting in a chair me by
Wys^ly to speak thus she began
My friend this thought se thou eschew
Ferest thou that richesse will fail
Subdue thy self to force and virtue
And be reuled by my counsel
Which shall the guide in each battle
So thou consider what thou have to do
Thou may get good by thy travail
For to find the and all thyn to
ONe god alone must thou honor
And him serve with all dylygence
And as thy self love thy neighbor
Against him do thou none offense
In trouble se thou have pacyence
After the time and the season
To each man have thou obedyence
These be the terms of reason
Thou sholdest not to largely
Rejoice thy self of thy richesse
Nor yet be wroth semblably
Of pouerte / pain / or dystresse
When Atropos himself does dress
Each to smite with his mortal lance
He smyteth the rich with cruelnesse
And to the poor has often suffraunce
Why should thyn heart for sere thus fail
Is it not richesse enough to the
To have thy hands ready to travail
Without wem or mayme of thy body
If that thou ^^bour certainly
Thou shall ^ot fail to have richesse
So that thou from all sin do fle
Peasably living in meekness
First avoid each sin mortal
Replenysshe the with the grace dyuyne
Behave the so in this life mortal
That thou to hell do not declyne
Submyt thy self unto the discyplyne
Of him that made each creature
Pray him thyn heart so to enlumyne
That thou aduersyte may endure
When need comes to thy presence
To besye labor infyx thy courage
So shall thou make him to go thens
Constreynynge him maugre his vysage
And if dystresse do unto the outrage
Thorough business away him chase
If thought would do to the damage
In some good deed put thy solace
And if pouertye do the assail
Or falls and feeble necessyte
Enforce thy body unto travail
By such mean shall thou cause them fle
If dysconfort do trouble the
Tend not unto his tempta cyon
If despair (...) old thy lady be
Leave her and come unto me reason
humility casts Pride



IF pride on the do adventure
Despyte dysdayne or presumpcyon
Beware of them they are not sure
Of them comes great abusyon
Cast fro the collaudacyon
Vain glory with mysgouernaunce
Fle fro falls ymagynacyon
Fle bostynge and oultrecuydaunce
If such vices on the do war
Them and their works se thou despise
Constrayne them by might to stand a far
Pray humylyte the to promise
Her help and socoure in any wise
With contemplacyon and devotion
But above all I the advise
Be meke of thyn entencyon
Humylyte must be the chyef
Against pride ground of all vice
And for to keep the fro myschyef
Do so that thou may have justice
Get good prouysyon if thou be wise
Let him ever keep the vantgarde
Than shall pride full of malice
Renounsynge the avoid rerewarde
charity casts Envy



AFter that pride is fro the chased
By the might of humylyte
With a another thou shall be menased
Which is dangerous called envy
Accompanied with myserye
With falshode / murder / and treason
Such shall be in his company
With sclaunder and falls detraccyon
As a dangerous capytayne
Envy will the assail and touch
He shall do the full mouche pain
If thou as subject unto him crouche
Ill report has he in his pouche
With many vices and diverse
Which unto virtue are reproach
Him always tendynge to reuers
When that thou see her the about
In me put thou thy trust and Joy
Be not afraid nor do not doubt
Trust well I shall them all destroy
Faith and charity shall them noye
Se thou always do her honor
So shall she wit on the employe
To know how she men does socour
Charity has waiting on her dygnyte
Very true love and miserycorde
Benevolence with grace and veryte
Among them found is no dyscorde
But peace meekness and concord
These shall the help in thy necessyte
And thus as I unto the record
They shall envy avoid fro the
patience ca^^^^ ire



ANd than when done is this assaute
On the shall come a tyrau^t dangerous
Whose name is Ire withouten fault
To all vice fyers and desirous
And unto virtue always contraryous
The which in servants does abound
He may well say that he is eurous
Whom this vice does not confound
Cruelte bears his banyer
Felonye is his chyef champyon
Peruersyte is his portere
Madness reygneth in his dongeon
Cursed murder that falls felon
Of his house is as chyef captain
Here is a cursed relygyon
To him that follows their train
Therefore if Ire do the dystresse
Show thy force and thy puysau^ce
Call unto the debonayrnesse
Against ire a full mighty lance
With her shall come fair suffraunce
Pacyence is chyef / with dyscrecyon
Steadfastness with attemperaunce
Subduynge the unto correccyen
Ire has neither mercy nor pety
On man nor woman here living
But echone assayleth full cruelly
Enemy to peace and to war according
Susteyner of each vice semynge
Whose furour melts man's heart
Which to his counsel are lenynge
Wherefore thy sight therfro dyuert
It is impossyble that a man Irous
May unto god do good service
For Ire is a sin right dangerous
Which is governed without Justice
It is a fyers and mortal vice
Which often does right great damage
Sith thou art warned be thou wise
List that he do to the outrage
Show thy force and puyssaunce
Call unto the force with nobleness
Pray pacyence to be thy lance
Which shall this vice lightly oppress
When ire is gone sleuthe shall her dress
On every side with the to fight
Which of all vice is chyef maystresse
A strong tyrant despysynge right
Dylyge^ce casts Sleuthe



AS chyef capytayne of all the rout
Sleuth shall have pleasure ye to assail
And son I put the out of dout
That in thy bed she shall not fail
On the to lie both wanne and pale
On her shall wait vnlustynesse
With negligence void of travail
Chyef guyder of all vnthryftenesse
Defend the fyersly as a man
For with sleuthe shall come rychelesse
For to subdue the if he can
Putting the to vnlustynesse
Accompanied with falls faintness
The which by their iniquyte
Many one brings fro tychesse
Unto great pain and pouerte
Cowardyse will the follow fast
If thou do not thy self defend
Unto the ground he will the cast
But if that thou thy might extend
And her withstanding if thou entende
With her to fight by force sovereign
Unto the ground shall she descend
Like the wind peased by rain
Sleuth to the will make good chere
By faint and feeble dyssymulacyon
But at the end is his manner
For to stange like the scorpyon
Beware of his abusyon
List that thou in his bonds rest
But for help in conclusyon
To god must thou make thy request
Against sleuth for thy defense
Entencyon to good must thou require
Provide chyefly for dylygence
Business with charge se thou desire
And for good heart se thou inquire
Pray good will to be thy gyde
So shall thou sleuth cast in the mire
Him and his ass as he does ride
Largess casts Covetyse.



After this assaut perylous
On the shall come void of Justice
One ougly fyers and dangerous
Whose name is called auaryce
Beware his cursed couetyse
For by his words falls and subtyle
Many one to him does he atyse
Whom at the end he does begyle
Auaryce is so ill and insatiable
Never fulfilled with richesse
And of his mind ay found unstable
By thought ever fulfilled with heaviness
This auaryce does all them oppress
Which lightly fyndeth not socoure
He and his servants will them dress
The to assail at every hour
When auaryce does the assail
With him will come full lightly
Vsurye and rapyne withouten fail
Falls swerynge and okerye
Murder / theft / and trecherye
Fraud / falshode / and decepcyon
Accompanied with roberye
Malice and cauyllacyon
When that thou see this company
With auaryce the to dystresse
Withdraw thy self to charity
To suffysaunce and to largess
But in largess avoid excess
And by alms I the ensure
Auaryce thou shall oppress
That he no longer shall endure
And if that any manner creature
Would say that these vices all
Be given unto them by nature
Or yet by destenye infernal
Mesemeth nay / their will is lyberall
God has us given reason and wit
Us for to guide unto joy eternal
Which we shall have ye we deserve it
Th^^fore my sone se that thou entende
Unto thy self with perfyte dylygence
Whereby thou may the fro this vice defend
For ever thou see by plain euydence
That auaryce full of malyuolence
Him most hurts that loves it best
With largess make for him defense
If thou would have thy mind in rest
sob^^te casts glotony



SO when thou overcome have auaryce
With the branches of his lynage
To the will come a cruel vice
Named glotonye full of outrage
Which will to the do great damage
If thou thy self to him subdue
As well in youth as in thy age
This vice on many does renew
To drink when thou have no thurst
Without mesure or any reason
And to ete when thou have no lust
Therein is no dyscrecyon
He may be called a foul gloton
That of his womb his god does make
Beware of this abusyon
Lift in his bonds this vice the take
Dysordered appetyte is with glotonye
And serves him chyef on the night
And gurmandyse is of his meyny
And sleuth with him increases might
All these fyersly on the will light
On each side the temptynge myghtely
But lift up thyn eyes to heaven bright
Besechynge god of help mekely
Sothely when that thy stomach
Is furnysshed with mete beyond nature
Thou may be lykened unto a sack
Replete with fylthe dunge and ordure
It dyspleaseth god sore / I the ensure
And to thy self do thou outrage
Than bableth thy tunge without mesure
To others hurt / sclander and damage
Yest may thou make right good resystence
Against them maugre their vysage
So that thou wylt take abstynence
The which shall be for thyn advantage
Sobryete is chyef of this passage
Which shall glotonye fro the avoid
Who in great drinking has usage
By death lightly is destroyed
Drunkenesse does the longes brenne
And makes the members for to quake
Dr^nken men often laugh and green
Than me ^^ooth them for fools take
Drunkenesse the wit does brake
It makes a man to fight and chyde
Sothly this vice often does make
A man of his friends homycyde
chastity casts lechery



When thou escaped have glotonye
And passed his cruel morsure
The sore assail will lechyerye
A cruel vice I the ensure
The which is of such nature
At her beginning her face to paynt
But if that she a while endure
Thy body will she make full faint
This foul sin ougly to name
With her branches right many fold
Him that it loves brings to shame
Example of Hercules the bold
I could mo count if that I would
Whom lechery has made to smerte
Bryefly if thou wylt have told
It destroys many a noble heart
It will the give foolysshe pleasaunce
With a desire right dysordynate
Superfluyte with his lance
If he with the do make debate
He will the lay on the ground prostrate
And bring the unto captyuyte
Making the fall fro thyn estate
And to know thy fragylyte
Cupydo shall thyn eyes bind
Having venus him to socoure
Thus when these two have made the blind
They shall the bring in great error
Than shall thou fall in to langoure
For when thou art in their bonds cought
If thou leave not by their rygoure
Shortly they shall the bring to naught
For to avoid the crudelyte
Of this false archer amerous
Take thou the shield of chastyte
Therein is fortune prosperous
Chastyte is so vyctoryous
That he will take vyndycacyon
Of this false vice full vycyous
And vaynquysshe his operacyon
Many be that will them excuse
Of their look and beholdynge
Saying that none can them accuse
For beholdynge of any thing
This reason is unto them semynge
Be not our eyes made for to se
Such excusacyons will they bring
For to defend their infelycyte
Thus say they for their excusaunce
Why may we not look here and there
That is troth without doutaunce
Of thy look nedest thou not to fere
But yet my sone this may thou lere
Thyn eyes unto the god has sent
With them to look every where
So that thou have a good intent
The fair regard of marriage
Is unto god right great delight
In good hope for to have lynage
Or else it is of no profit
Therefore if thou wylt be perfyte
Drive away this foolysshe pleasaunce
Geuynge unto him no respyte
For to take the in to his dance
Remember the great and fore vengeance
Taken of god for this outrage
Often times without doutaunce
Of the master it makes the page
But as I said in marriage
Behave the as thou ought to do
With good hope for to have lynage
Or else sothly thou synnest to
Therefore in bryef conclusyon
To avoid the pain infernal
Fle from all ill operacyon
Procedynge of these sins mortal
And of pride in especyall
For which Lucyfer fell down to hell
Take this for a doctrine general
Which ensuynge I shall the tell
Against pride take thou meekness
For envy take thou charity
Pacyence puts Ire in dystresse
By dylygence sluethe is in captyuyte
For couetyse take thou lyberalyte
Glotonye by sobrenesse is made thrall
Chastyte subdueth lechery
But good and ferme faith rules all
It is troth that man's nature
To all ill vice is prone and ready
Wherefore the better may he endure
The which uses somewhat percyte
Which is a great friend unto chastyte
Against sin take such resystence
If thou wylt avoid aduersyte
And purchase a place in gods presence
Therefore if thou wylt heaven obtain
As thy self love thy neighbor
Fro mortal sin thy self refrain
Fere god and do him honor
Do his hyddynge which is thy creatoure
Speak little here what wise men say
So may thou escape terrene lan goure
And have whereon to live always
Where as many words are spoken
For to speak in breef langage
Often wysedom and troth is broken
Of much speech comes great damage
Who in great langage has usage
Some word may he say in good intent
The which sounds to great outrage
And causes him after to repent
Behave thy self curtes and amyable
Cause no debate / strife / nor dyscorde
Be prudent / simple / and seruyable
Speak thou of no man ill report
Take good hope and good confort
Lo here the plain way of hardness
Which shall the bring unto the fort
That thou desyrest
that is richesse
Richesse gotten by fore labor
By watchynge travail and by pain
Is unto god much more pleasour
Than it is when it is sudden
One may in this life mundayne
Obtain richesse with great virtue
But when it is ill gotten certain
The getters unto the devil subdue
Follow therefore the virtuous way
On the right hand that none does begyle
Leave the left / the which always
Destroys man / be he never so subtyle
This way that none does defyle
On the right hand is called dylygence
For though the left on the do smyle
The latter end is void of all defense
In this cursed way on the left side
Many a man does walk gladly
So at the end are they destroyed
For that their good is gotten falsely
Some be drowned and some hanged on hye
Be they never so hardy / subtyle / or wise
Such is the end / but the other sothly
Brings a man unto paradyse
A man that follows the left way
Can uneath him self refrain
He that him self refrain not may
Shall find it hard to come again
Therefore begin in the way of pain
Which shall the bring to the sterred regyon
And for thy ledars have no dysdayne
To take understanding wit and reason
Some fools ill and obstynate
When they are repreued by Justice
Say that they there to are destynate
Wenynge for the excuse their malice
They say that fortune must accomplyse
That / that is their destyne
Thus does the devil these wretches atyse
To keep them in their incredulyte
Good will must thou have therefore
Avoid ill thought fro thyn intent
And if that thou be tempted sore
Beware do not thereto consent
Lift up thyn eyes to the fyrmament
Prayenge for help and than I reason
Shall be right glad / feign and dylygent
The to delyuet in every season
If destryne should have domynacyon
Than our good deeds should not avail
Echone would make transgressyon
If thou so think thy mind does fail
If thou do well for thy travail
Thou shall have Joy / and for ill punycyon
Get heaven / and withouten fail
Thou escapest all tribulacyon
Though that thy destenye be naught
Be thou not ready to do the werst
He that is of a cursed thought
Evermore leueth the best
If thou do ill beware the last
Justice to each gives his guerdon
When thy soul tro this life is past
Thou shall have even as thou have done
In this noble way of dylygence
If that thou thy self redress
Thou shall by plain experyence
By mean there of obtain richesse
As for the way of sleuthfulnesse
Now ever it appear the end is naught
There is but woe / pain and dystresse
Dysconfort / trouble / care / and thought
The way of sleuth a man does bring
Unto a place of captyuyte
Where naught is but hunger and mourning
Called the manner of woe and pouette
There is no thing but necessyte
Bread nor drink / work nor travail
There lives man in such penurye
That hunger constrayneth his heart to fail
When one is fall in such myschaunce
And subdued in such pouertye
He must to have his sustenaunce
His clothes sell releued for to be
When they are gone than what does he
Than must he be a beggar or a thief
So in conclusyon here may ye se
Of sleuthe what is the end and prese
Of such folk that been ocyous
By right no man should have mercy
They are to them self contraryous
Sleuth dysceyueth them so falsely
Some be pale black and rusty
Against the son sitting for solace
Some dye for hunger some cold and thursty
Sorrow mot he have that it does purchase
If thou have passed a place perylous
And thens escaped without damage
Take good head se thou be cautelous
Return not theder for thyn advantage
But the behave as prudent wise and sage
Avoiding all sleuthe and negligence
Go about by another passage
Which is the way of dylygence
If thou se some going amysse
Lightly avoid their company
Such as in thy presence thy mouth will kiss
And would the sle if they might preuely
Be not aquaynted with such commonly
Keep well thy counsel show not it
When one blind ledeth another lightly
Often they both fall in the pytte
Take therefore the right passage
Of good hope and good esperaunce
Be dylygent for thyn own advantage
For therein is richesse and pleasaunce
Both in plentye and in suffysaunce
But set not thyn heart thereon to sore
Get not wrongfully such abundaunce
That thy soul suffer pain therefore
Who that tychesse to much does pryse
For it taking labor and greuaunce
Is so brought by unhappy couetyse
That he is never at his pleasaunce
Though he have richesse in abundaunce
For all is he not there with content
But a man that has suffysaunce
To all good gladly does consent
Suffysaunce does god gretely please
As thou full well may understand
And couetyse does him dysplease
Therefore avoid his cruel hand
Let him not take the in his bond
List his excess do the begyle
If thou remember thou art but fond
With it thou endurest but a while
Remember it is no thing permanent
In abundaunce to have richesse
As water rennynge sone is it spent
When death comes all thyn excess
Of wealth and richesse tourneth to heaviness
Thou must it all leave the behind
Than one of thy kynne with largess
Blows thy pens out with the wind
Therefore with little be thou content
Thanking ever god of pouerte
Thank him of that he has the sent
Avoiding sin and iniquyte
If thou with sin subdued be
Thou can do no deed merytorye
Do well and than I ensure the
Thou shalt obtain the heavenly glory
Some folk in all their life
To get good are full dylygent
Lettynge neither for hatred ne strife
And yet are they never content
Unto all falshode they do consent
They tend not but to get and save
With couetyse is their heart so burnt
That they think never enough to have
When they are most in fortunes grace
Lyfted up hye unto the moon
She showing them her froward face
Causes them lightly to come down
Though they before sat in their trone
Fortune on them has made a mow
Whereby their richesse fro them is gone
Than on the ground lie they full low
Therefore se thou fortune defye
Sith her richesse is so unstable
And in god only thy self affye
In whom is richesse perdurable
His suffysaunce is full profitable
Therefore in him thy self assure
And in this purpose be thou stable
God him loves that does endure
A man rich full of ygnoraunce
Which in time passed has had honor
In fortunes richesse having pleasaunce
Is now down driven by a sudden shoure
He never before was used to labor
Thus after he has lepte from hype to low
By ydelnes fortune does on him loure
He lies on the ground and none will him know
Of clothing desire thou no new guyse
But clothe thy self always honestly
Suffer not pride upon the to rise
But go ay meke and symplye
And se thou be content only
So thou have good whereon to Iyue
Without gatherynge over largely
Thou know not when death will arryue
If it fortune that by necessyte
Thou put thy self in the service
Of any man of great auctoryte
Other lord / merchant / or Justice
Be not folysshe / flaterynge / nor nyse
Nor yet slothful in any wise
Se that thou flee fro echo vice
Leest he the utterly despise
What ever he say suffer mekely
Fere him with love entyer and cordyall
Serve him both day and night truly
Say of him good over all
Remember love is so special
That without it no good is done
Of his goods be not lyberall
And god shall pay the thy guerdon
Thou ought of right to set thy heart
With all thy might and thy puyssaunce
Thy masters will for to aduerte
And it to fulfill without doutaunce
So call thou unto thy subuenaunce
This proverb that I the lere
Keep it in thy remembrance
Love goth never without fere
Fere without love may right well be
We fere without love them that us menase
But where as true love is in certaynte
It makes men live even by compass
Therefore this love se thou purchase
And than thou shalt fall in his favor soon
Than thy reward to thy solace
Shall be even after as thou have done
If thou truly thy master serve
He shall perceive it within a while
Than shalt thou have that thou do deserve
With a a good name which none does fyle
But if that thou do him begyle
He shall perceive it at the last
Than shall thy deeds thy name defyle
So out of his house he shall the cast
When that thou art thus departed
Without his love full folysshely
As a servant full ill aduerted
Another master must thou seek truly
Than shall other come pryuely
And inquire whether thou were ill or good
If he say ill that they may spy
No man will have the by the rode
But if that any be in necessyte
And can none other servant find
Than parauenture he will have the
And always be to the unkind
But if he be a fool or blind
Else will he none of thy seruyse
Than shalt thou wander out with the wind
No master shall love thy guyse
If that thou will thy master please
Thou must have these three propretees
First must thou have an asses ears
With an hertes fete in all degrees
An hogs snoute / and after these
By such means shall I declare
That in time of aduersytees
By them the better thou may fare
By an asses ears this is meant
That thou must harken him about
If thou se he be not content
Say naught but se thou him doubt
Where as he is se thou not route
What he commands do gladly
Than shall he not put the out
If thou behave the thus wisely
By this hogs snoute mean I this
What mete so ever to the is brought
Though it be somewhat a mysse
Take pacyence and say thou naught
Ete thou it not but it be ought
Rather suffer thou a little penurye
Another time better shall be bought
For to amend that Iniurye
Let thy snoute smell in each place
And specially for to seek labor
If thou so do in little space
Thou shalt not fail of his favor
Let thy pacyence overcome his rygour
And take good head to his condycyon
Se that thou always him honor
Submyttynge the to his correccyon
This sygnyfyeth the fete of an heart
Thou must do thy master socour
Both day and night though thou should smerte
To run and go at every hour
Day nor night spare no labor
Rather than he should have damage
Help him in wealth and in doloure
If any man do to him outrage
Thus reason left of her parlyament
Than after turned I me to rest
And than came wisdom full dylygent
A man prudent / dyscrete and honest
Stondynge nere before my breast
I lyfted my heed unto him nere
He made such gloss upon the text
That I had marvel him to here
wisdom.



HE that him rules by reason
Geteth both riches and honor
Taking upon him labor
Ever has he a rich mansyon
That is ruled by reason
He puruayeth each thing in season
As best is when the time is grene
After a storm the son does shene
That man is quyte of all dyscencyon
Which is ruled by reason
Sothly my friend it is abusyon
This caduke richesse greatly to praise
To many a man it does disease
He auoydeth sclaunder and detraccyon
Which is ruled by reason
Ye know that within a little season
Fortunes favor many one procure
But of her grace no man is sure
Therefore he wise is in conclusyon
Which is ruled by reason
I make towns and castelles strong of walls
I make Iestes / stories / and comedyes
I made the seven arts lyberalles
With poemes and many tragydees
I have made many omelyes
Which unto man are full profitable
Whereby he may avoid all folyes
And of his mind be ferme and stable
When reason on man has dominacyon
I promote him unto great dygnyte
I hate dyscorde / and adulacyon
And love peace / concord / and equity
He that will live well in prospetyte
Must have reason to be his governor
And than will I of mine own lyberte
Of very right be his protector
I am wisdom which have knowlegynge
Of good and ill without doutaunce
But without reason I do no thing
For in her is so manner ygnoraunce
Who me procures I him auaunce
Wherefore sone if thou will proceed
Be ever concent with suffysaunce
Than shall I help the at thy need
Obey to reason what ever she say
With all thyn heart in lowlynesse
Than by her grace shalt thou puruay
Both worship honor and richesse
She helps men out of dystresse
By her wit and dyscrecyon
If thou will come to parfytnesse
Put the in her subgeccyon
The auctour
Thus wisdom unto me spoke
At reasons will and commandment
Whereby great comfort did I take
His reasons were so wise and prudent
On whose saying I fyxed mine intent
Concludynge upon the way of pain
But for the time passed I was dolent
Which lost / could not be called again
Than half faint for watchynge excessyfe
I lyfted my head up lokynge me about
Left alone sore / sad / and pensyfe
Than was I again in doubt
I fered them that before went out
Than saw I one full of grauyte
Go compassynge my bed about
With two servants in his company
When he unto me did appear
I thought he had been some advocate
His hode was furred with menyuere
His gown of the same like his estate
He me beheld without any debate
And said his name was dysceyte full slye
Of whom comes many a mortal fate
His little varlet was named vsurye
Falshode was his servants name
So knew I by his false vysage
The master cared no thing for shame
Yet was he a comely personage
He me so flaterynge by his langage
Set him down there by my cheke
I meruaylled what was his usage
Than thus unto me he began to speak
vsurye

SAy my friend whereon do thou (...)
Thou do thy self destroy with thought
All thy wit thou do abuse
Thou studyest sore and all for naught
Reason has the in her bonds cought
But let her go by my counsel
Than of richesse that thou have sought
By my help thou shalt not fail
Wisdom has the aduertysed
To put the in reasones subgeccyon
A straw man let her be despised
And yield the under my proteccyon
Who loves reason lacks dyscrecyon
Thou always see a man reasonable
That fereth god Justice and punycyon
Has never ought this is verytable
Reason that fool does the counsel
To live always virtuously
Thou shalt have hunger for thy travail
She byddeth the always labor besely
But by my craft I all suddenly
Make him this day poor rich to morrow
Therefore reason se thou defye
Let her and all hers go with sorrow
Reason with little is well content
She sets no thing by excess
For to labor she is ever dylygent
Without gatherynge of great richesse
But I exalte men unto noblesse
Sodaynlye by my art subtyle
If any would do me falsnesse
I take him lightly in his own wyle
But while that thou ensuest reason
Thou shalt never come to dygnyte
But poor and simple in every season
As a bond man had in captyuyte
Out of all manner hope lyberte
Oppressed shalt thou be over all
Every day well may thou se
That the great does the small
Leave therefore reason by my counsel
If thou will have richesse lightly
And if that any do the assail
By my craft I shall blere their eye
If that thou do entende to me
Thou shalt find that thou have sought
I shall be at thy will ready
And while I live thou shalt lack naught
If that thou will come to thyn ease
And have gold at thy pleasour
Thy neighbor se that thou disease
With iniwaye / damage / force / and rygour
Let me dysceyte be as thy governor
Or else my servant vsurye
From one to other go every hour
With a glosynge langage of flaterye
Let thy tunge be as a knyfe
With every man therewith to rage
And where thou would have no strife
Show thy self dyscrete and sage
Specially where as is (...)
Speak fair till thou have thy pray
But yet let not to do damage
To every man while that thou may
Govern the ever with dyscepcyon
Care not for them that are in pain
At poor folk have thou deryson
To get good do the not refrain
For to deceive men set thy brain
In their presence show them good chere
But of their hurt se thou be feign
In their absence in each manner
Speak fair with falshode among
Show thy self meke and treatable
Take money by right and wrong
Make the rich man miserable
Gather together tychesse arrable
Fere neither god ne the devil of hell
Of thy words be thou not stable
To rich enuyous
to poor cruel
Pay naught in plede / nor in process
Lene no thing but unto usure
Se that thou the poor oppress
Take their heritage and nouryture
Spare no thing the to periure
And if that any do the repreue
By swerynge fast thy self assure
From his good him to remeue
Thou shalt have richesse at the last
To live in great prosperyte
If thou speak fair and borowe fast
Faynynge thy self in charity
For now a days in troth and veryte
No man of the will have count
Without clothing of auctoryte
Like a knight or a vycount
Keep thy terms like thyn estate
With ermyne or sables furre thy gown
If any man have envy therate
By thy craft turn him up set down
Thus may thou increase thy renown
And if any come with the to speak
Let thy man say thou art not in the town
That he may come often the to seek
Let him return the to inquire
Be not asshamed for to lie
And what thing that thou do desire
Be it good or badde do it lightly
Take no head to well nor truly
So it be done take thou no thought
And I shall help the ever besely
So that at need thou shalt lack naught
To him that is curteys and lowly
Every man dare agaynsaye
But to one rich gaye and hastye
Scant is one that dare say nay
They will him fere list that he fraye
Therefore each man will him forbere
Feign felonye on them to lay
And than shall every man the fere
What ever thou do work by whle
Fill thy stomach full of falsenesse
Fro the reason do thou exyle
Of her naught comes but dystresse
Refuse faith take thou falsnesse
For such is the world in this season
As thou may se by euydence express
They are all poor that follow reason
Se thou be ready aye to take
Without gyuynge ought again
Thy promise swerynge se thou forsake
Thus may thou have richesse sudden
Let thy tunge follow the common train
Of adulacyon covered with eloquence
Thus shall every man be feign
Unto the for to do reverence
If there come to the any myschaunce
Care not it shall do the no grefe
Thou shalt have for thy sustenaunce
Me and my men the to relefe
We shall defend the fro myschefe
And under the vmbre of veryte
Though he be never so falls a thief
We shall overcome him by our subtylte
Look what it is for to have polyce
With craft subtylte and practyke
By which means he that works slye
Casts his encmye lightly in the dyke
True wisdom se thou exyle
Which causes thought and heaviness
Muse always men to begyle
Let not to make fair promesses
Every day here twenty masses
But have at none of them devotion
And space thou not to take excesses
Of theft / falshhode / and extorcyon
Believe me for thyn advantage
And refuse thou reason utterly
Falshode my friend shall be thy page
Exalting the to richesse myghtely
When thou art in such case truly
Every man shall do the honor
And if that any do to the vylany
Se thou him tame by thy rygour
While that reason on the does reyne
Thou shalt never come to worthynesse
But ever of pouerte complain
Avoid of mirth full of sadness
Thou shalt not need to count express
Crowns / nobles / nor royalles
Thou shalt be void of all richesse
And of degrees temporalles
Thou have herd what I have the told
This is my mind and my counsel
Wherefore on me se thou be bold
And do here after for thyn avail
Thus may thou come without travail
To richesse so thou autoyde reason
If thou thus do without fail
No more will I say at this season
The auctour.
When this false catyf had thus said
I was abstracte nere fro my mind
His words made me sore afraid
That I unstable was as the wind
About me socour could I none find
For fere I quaked / cold were my fete
I had in me as good a mind
As has a gose upon a spete
That which reason did me counsel
Was good wholesome and reasonable
Dysceyte contrary did me assail
Showing me crafts dysceyuable
Thus was my mind as varyable
As a fane strondynge in the wind
In no purpose ferme nor stable
As now a days we may find
As I thus lay troubled full sore
Wisdom returned to me again
More prudent than he was before
Which with his langage dyscrete and plain
Exorted me for to refrain
Me fro that thief decepcyon
And than reason should me maintain
And thus said he in conclusyon
Wisdom.
wisdom.



Do thou trust falshode or dysceyte
A poor man they will the dyffame
They love but dyscorde and debate
They praise the ill and good does blame
And they pryncypally are the same
Which brings man to the pytte of hell
Trust in reason most noble of fame
Which no thing does but that is well
That man is mad that leueth reason
Unto dysceyte for to be lenynge
He that so does after in brefe season
Against him self is murmuring
Therefore be thou the withdrawynge
For of him venym does dyscende
Live after reason above all thnge
For who well lives well does end
How many daily do thou se
That leuynge reason them self assure
In falshode having great dygnyte
Fro poor men taking their pasture
In this extorcyon they long endure
By falshode getynge good mundayne
But when that known is their nature
They he made poor by chance sudden
We have often seen great wyndes blow
And with a little rain overcome
So many men be brought full low
Before exalted by falls custom
Some rayed in scarlet / and other some
Arrayed in gold / tyssue / and velvet
The one after unto the sword become
The other trained unto the gybet
If that they had trusted in reason
Leuynge falshode that dysceyuour
They should not have had such confusyon
But still have lived in their honor
Reason that lady of great valor
Does naught that is to repreue
But dysceyte that falls traitor
His chief subgertes does myschefe
Sith that richesse is so varyable
Wherefore take we therefore such pain
Considering our life so unstable
From death we can us not refrain
The day and hour is uncertain
Therefore let us live scarsely
For this is a thing most certain
That first or last we must needs dye
Dysceyte in his first beginning
To each man well enough does sound
But an evil death is his ending
His scolers thus does he confound
But him that in richesse does abound
By reason gotten each man does praise
In dysceyte such end is found
That every man does it dysprayse
By reason well may thou obtain
Richesse mundayne suffycyently
Who that has none bydeth in pain
And often is entreted vncurteysly
Who has not money and that largely
Were he as holy as was saint poule
Where ever he goth contynually
He shall be taken but for a fool
Who that by reason does good purchase
He lives therewith right merely
To his pleasour with great solace
But if that any through envy
Would do him wrong or iniurye
He must to god call for socoure
And than shall he full hastily
Him aid and help at every hour
Thus in my bed sore troubled laid
Half releued was my courage
I took good head to that he said
For he was wise dyscrete and sage
And thinking it for mine advantage
Submytted me to the grace dyuyne
I know dysceyte by his outrage
Would me have brought unto ruin
So purposed I fully to take
The counsel of my lady reason
And dysceyte utterly forsake
With his falshode and abusyon
Than being of this opinion
Reason did unto me appear
With her face bright as the son
Arrayed in a rich manner
This lady was right gracyous
Pleasant curteys and amyable
On me lokynge with chere Joyous
With a salutacyon right honorable
For this false caytyfe miserable
Dysceyte with his servants two
For all their chere abhomynable
At her coming did fro me go
Reason.
Reason



I Am glad of the perfyte vyctorye
Which thou have obtained this night
It shall be to the right merytorye
In the high trone that is so light
Wisdom with his noble might
Has been for the a good solycytour
But sith thou have agreed to the right
Now shalt thou be my seruytour
I give the in commandment
For to serve me ferme and faithfully
Haunt company wise and prudent
So shalt thou have riches largely
I know that man's mind truly
By temptacyon full often does vary
What I command do thou gladly
And to me reason be not contrary
What man that I do sustain
I make clean from all manner vice
But he that falshode does maintain
Hates concord / peace / and Justice
God will that thou leave malice
And vsurye in pryncypall
Which thou must do if thou be wise
With perfyte will and cordyall
I keep men in their fraunchyse
I make the feeble strong and able
Dysceyte to ill men does atyse
And does naught that is profitable
Be therefore constaunt / ferme / and stable
Endue thy heart with forte and virtue
So shalt thou dysceyte full miserable
By godly wisdom strongly subdue
Good name is better than richesse
The grace of god is full excellent
Trust not in the fair promise
Of dysceyte / ne his terms eloquent
Behave thy self wise and prudent
Be ruled by grace and pacyence
Both day and night be dylygent
To get the treasour of sapyence
And if that god give the wisdom
Be not thereof proud nor glorious
But more simple se thou become
Thanking him with chere pyteous
Let thy mind be ever virtuous
Submyttynge the to thy creator
Which is so meke and gracyous
That he will be thy governor
With each man be in charity
Beginning at thy self first of all
Let all thy deeds sound unto equity
To poor men be thou lyberall
Men wise and virtuous to the call
Which shall the keep from all damage
Avoid flaterers from thy hall
The to dysceyue is their usage
With me abides none malycyous
Tyrant traitor nor cowarde
But noble people wise and virtuous
And peace as chief bears the standarde
Who casts on me his regard
Shall suerly escape both hole and sound
Who in dysceyte has his forward
When he most trusts is brought to ground
If that by fortune thou have aduersyte
Without noise pacyently endure
God knows thy fragylyte
Fro point to point I the ensure
And if dysceyte on the procure
Avoid the cause the time and place
For without doubt I the ensure
Dysceyte stynketh in gods face
Where as is pride myschefe is bye
Therefore of humylyte take comfort
Falls flaterye se thou defye
And tend no thing to dyscomforte
Beware falshode and ill report
Avoid robberye and all manner wrong
If thou do as I the exorte
In virtue shalt thou live full long
Thou may get if thou follow me
Richesse mundayne in suffysaunce
Without falshode or iniquyte
Or doing thy neighbor any greuaunce
Thy good and ill in a balaunce
Shall be weyed at the day extreme
And than after thyn ordinance
The mighty Judge shall the deem
Therefore sone by me thou may
Obtain goods mundayne and eternal
Live without thought in low array
Without any pain corporal
Of this richesse that is temporal
Thou may with Joy have here thy part
And the high glory celestyall
When thy soul shall hens depart
Behold what two great benefyces
I ordain for my seruytour
Where other filled with malyces
By falshode lose all such honors
Periurers thieves and seductours
Saturate with sin and ordure
Live here in castelles and in toures
But their estate can not endure
Robbery / pykynge / and cauyllacyon
Theft with falshode does govern
That falls tyrant decepcyon
And ledeth him unto the tavern
Falls vsurye does dyscerne
Their arms with his terms blasynge
With pride of all vice lantern
Unto their counseyll is lenynge
Such as they have but small conscience
Wherefore se that thou them despise
They refuse virtue / cunning / and science
Lenynge to ryotte such is their guyse
Wherefore dear sone I the advise
Let not their power on the extend
For if it do I the promise
At tyborne will they make the end
If falshode through his wylynes
Exalte a man unto honor
And after if that his riches
Be lost by some sudden shoure
They to whom ye did rygour
Before will Joy of his damage
They will be ready at every hour
To him to render his outrage
One unto another will say
Look where he lies that was so rich
His good ill gotten is now away
And lo where he lies in the dyche
We thought that his end would be such
He has lived in wealth to long
His scabbed skyn lo now does ytche
That he dare not come us among
Thus may thou se it is profitable
To live truly in this mortal life
Getynge richesse by means verytable
Sith it ill gotten increases strife
Who labors for richesse excessyfe
Weneth to come unto hye estate
But at the last he abides pensyfe
And every good man does him hate
Leave therefore vice and love virtue
If thou will live in lybertye
And than men knowing the good and true
Will be glad of thy company
But yet must thou have humylyte
With pacyence and concord thy way to dress
With faith / troth / and equity
If thou will get heavenly richesse
Be thou simple of countenance
Speak fair with chere amyable
Beware dysceyte and fere his lance
Be not of purpose varyable
It is a thing abhomynable
Vnde an abide of faythfulnesse
To have a falls heart and reprouable
Full of wrath / ire / and falsnesse
Under the vmbre of veryte
Many one uses falls dyscepcyon
Using to speak right faithfully
But falshode is in their entencyon
Then think other to dysceyue by treason
But their self dysceyued do they find
But learn this sone of me reason
God knows every man's mind
God knows plain and clearly
Man's mind thought and courage
For he by his grace ineffably
Made him like to his own image
Sholdest thou not than do him homage
Which has the given so great a benefyce
Passing all other in advantage
That is the realm of paradyse
And after when by dysobedyence
Man was dampened to be in pain
That high lord a lamb of innocence
With his own blood brought him again
This blessed lord had no dysdayne
For to become a man mortal
And suffer death with many a pain
To make us fre that erst were thrall
This lord chief master of Justice
Shall keep his Judgment fynall
Than some that there be most of price
Shall than be myserablest of all
The poor and rich shall be egall
Each man shall have like audyence
All mankind there in general
Shall there abide this Iuges sentence
The aungelles shall their trumpettes blow
Calling men to the Judgment
Than every man full well shall know
How that he here his life has spent
With an high voice that lord omnipotent
Shall call my servants with him to dwell
The badde all pensyf / woo / and dolent
Perpetually shall be dampened to hell
Now art thou so that thou may choose
The hard way of salvation
Or else if thou will that abuse
Thou fyndest the way of perdycyon
Do after me sone that am reason
To avoid the fendes cruel bond
And than that Judge prince of dyscressyon
Shall the set on his right hand
On the rain bow meke and propyce
On hye shall sit that mighty lord
Having on his one hand Justice
And on the other myserycorde
With them shall be peace and concord
And veryte shall be there plain
This Judge with these at one accord
Shall Judge the lygnage humayne
God shall my servants unto him call
With meke chere and countenance
Unto his high sete emperyall
But after another manner of chance
He shall say words of great penance
To falshode servants which shall be dum
Putting them to extreme vttraunce
Ite maledicti in ignem eternum
What shall their richesse than avail
When they shall have but ryghtwysnesse
Each man shall have after his travail
The good light and the ill derkenesse
Some shall think it a day of swetnesse
But other some with cry and yell
Shall think that day of bytternesse
Dyscendynge down to the pytte of hell
Therefore friend to thy self take heed
Renounce falshode with all iniquyte
This day shall make the to have dread
If thou it call to mind truly
Who geteth richesse here falsely
Of hell pains shall have his part
And therefore hither come am I
Fro this pain the to dyuerte
Therefore arise and do me homage
With meke heart and entencyon
Refusing falshode with his outrage
Making suck prouysyon
That thou may live by dyscressyon
Than shall I make the to possede
A place in the heavenly regyon
Lo all my servants has such mede
The auctour.
Reason



AFter that I herd my lady reason
So wisely speak full of prudence
I forsook dysceyte / falshode and treason
Yeldynge me unto her magnyfycence
I kneled down in her presence
Knowing it for mine advantage
With meke Jove and obedyence
Unto reason I made homage
Holding my hands up to her grace
With low chere did I me present
There showed I her all the case
How that I my life had spent
This noble lady wife and prudent
Surely unto me did promise
So I would make amendment
To be my lady and maystresse
Than this lady approached nete
Of all other most good and gracyous
With lowly countenance and chere
Of my health greatly desirous
And to her servants never contraryous
Seeing her nere thus unto her said I
Most excellent lady most good and glorious
To you will I me submytte gladly
Do ye with me what is your pleasour
I am ever ready glad and dylygent
To do all thing that may you honor
Never willing more to be neglygent
To such virtues / or counseyle prudent
I defye falshode with his subtyltees
To you obeyenge with hole intent
Both in wealth and aduersytees
Reason was glad in each degree
When she herd me say in this wise
Than as sister unto humylyte
Out of her chair sone did she rise
And kissing me she did promise
Ever at my need for to be kind
Than suddenly in a secret wise
This lady entered in to my mind
Thus while that reason was my guide
I governed me well and wisely
Dysceyte and falshode setting aside
With wretchedness and vsurye
To bide with reason purposed I
As long as god lent me my life
Being in this purpose did I espy
Approach an old man and his wife
When I them saw I was content
They were so meke and gracyous
The man's name was euydent
Good will / to none was contraryous
The womannes good heart to none enuyous
The which two had with them brought
A young child / pleasant / good and virtuous
In excellence passing my thought
This child ever by good will stood
Upon her hand to her lenynge
This was his name / lust to do good
As me thought unto my semynge
These three together on me smiling
Approached nere and first of all
Good heart began with this saying
With meke countenance and lyberall
Good heart.

good will

lust to do good



Since that reason rests in the
Sone I shall not from the depart

There shall we shyfte for to puruay
To help the out of all greuaunce

Gotten only by way of dylygence
The which place shall the auaunce
To the hye degree of excellence
Follow us and we shall the bring
In to the hye way which is right spacyous
The which way has at his ending
A fair castle pleasant and sumptuous
In which remains a treasour precious
That is worldly goods full of noblesse
This place is called that is so beauteous
Labor / wherein remains richesse
Reason right often has the told
Of this castle which is so honorable
Passing all castelles a thousand fold
And unto mankind most profitable
But the way is so varyable
That none can come thither without us three
But he must have some fortune miserable
And be compelled again to fle
Therefore who thither does him dress
Not having us in his company
Shall never truly have richesse
His fortune is in great dyffycultye
Many one comes unto dygnyte
By falshode / vsurye / and rapyne
But at the rnde simple pouertye
Keeps them fallen in to ruin
Sith thou applyest to reasons doctrine
I shall help the ever at thy need
My wife shall unto the enclyne
My sone shall help the for to speed
Do after us and have no dread
For we three shall to the be kind

Therefore arise and come lightly
And we shall well for the puruay

For after great rest often comes thought
The auctour.
I accorded unto them lightly
Avoid of sloth and negligence
With them thither to go gladly
Unto this place chief of dylygence
Which of all honor has preemynence
Each man for to help at his need
Than thought I for to recompense
The time lost / and thither to speed
But I told them I knew no thing
Of dylygence / nor yet of business
Good heart said / by our techynge
Thou shalt know the way express
Thou may both say and think doutlesse
While we three are thy conductours
That thou art void of heaviness
And sure of all worldly honors
Awake and put the in apparayle
To much sleep hurts man certain
In this way must thou fore travail
For reason so does it ordain
For what man that takes pain
On him with travail and abstynence
To richesse needs must attain
Therefore arise and go we hens
Go sone thou must bestow thy time
In other wise than thou have done
Let not to labor for no crime
Lettynge thy deeds ay sound to reason
And as for me I me abandon
With my husband on the to wait
Unto this castle and noble mansyon
Wherein is richesse without dysceyte
Who other begyleth him self dysceyueth
Richesse ill gotten comes to ill end
Who in this castle falshode conceyueth
Shall not his power far extend
But after death if thou will ascend
Take me and travail to be thy guide
Which in this castle shall the defend
By our means in every tide.
Lust to do good.
Do my faders commandment
If thou truly would have richesse
And to my mother be dylygent
In that thou may with lowlynesse
And I shall do my will and business
Unto my power the to sustain
Wherefore avoid thou slothfulness
And us to follow take on the pain

To bear the candell had great pleasaunce.
Than went they forth all in ordinance
As folk replenysshed with meekness
That to behold their countenance

Lust to do good went always

THan entered we in to the way
Of great pain called dylygence
Without resting I went always
There found I no resystence
These three were ever in my presence
For the way was unknown to me
I hasted me under their defense
That I might there the sooner be
Thus went we forth a little while
Of the way was I ygnoraunt
My three felawes did on me smyle
On me beholdynge with glad semblaunt
Than saw I this castle fair and pleasant
Most rich / strong and sumptuous
When I it saw so resplendaunt
Sothly of heart I was full Joyous
Unto the gate when I was nigh
I would have entered without sauegarde
But the porter resysted me
Beholdynge me with chere froward
Of that castle he kept the guard
His wife was ever in his presence
Thynkest thou to enter he said cowarde
Not having our love nor our license
Business.
Thynkest thou to enter without our leave
In to this castle chief ground to richesse
Nay nay thou must hens remeue

Yet may thou not here have resydence

For with the am I not content

THan business and cure brought me in to
This castle / ample / and spacyous
Showing me men and women also
Sore workynge and none ocyous
The^ to behold was a thing meruaylous
Both young and old of every facultye
To labor was there none contraryous
Each one would before his felawe be
They smote with hambers that were strong
That to behold I had great wonder
Such a noise was them among
That it sounded like the thunder
Some were above and some were under
In their shertes labourynge for hete
Some did pieces break in sunder
Some again them together beat
To behold them I had delight
Seeing them work so lustely
That to labor I had appetyte
Cure and business that dydespye
Which said unto me shortly
That if I could labor well
They would get me license gladly
In that castle for to dwell
Than to them answered I certain
That to labor I was content
Than spoke they to the capytayne
Requyrynge him for to assent
He granted me a place present
Conuenyent for my degree
There promised I for to be dylygent
So that in their favor I might be
I set me down unto labor
With business and parfyte dylygence
Trusting thereby to have honor
Cure and business were not thens
I was right glad of their presence
For they taught me how I should do
Unto them I gave audyence
And what they said I agreed thereto
Than came the wife of the capytayne
Going here and there trottynge
They told me that her name was pain
Each man's labor vysytynge
Her hands and her forehede swetynge
She tarried no more in any place
Than does a pursuyuaunt riding
When he would purchase some grace
Sometime in her smock rennynge fast
No thing tendynge to rest nor ease
She ran still while her breath would last
Not sparynge for no disease
She was dylygent each man to please
And me beheld approchynge nere
She said sir porter ye me dysplease
For bringing of this stranger here
Pain.
Sir business that are porter
Of this castle show me plain
Who has brought hither this stranger
I saw him never before certain
Comes he fro france or fro brytayne
I must know his cause and his intent
He must submytte him unto my pain
Or else in vain his time is spent
Business.
My lady pain have ye no doubt
For hither is he come truly
With good heart and good will him about
Which hither has him brough besely
Lust to do good is to him nigh
Which is a child right honorable
Ye shall find him to you ready
Humble of heart and seruysable
Cure.
My husbonde and I love him right well
We shall help him at every need
Ye shall not need him ^^ght to tell
Therefore my lady have ye no dread
Even as he does give him his mede
And my husbonde shall be his borowe
That in his labor he shall speed
And neither spare for pain nor sorrow
Pain:

YE say both well and wisely
I know not yet how he will preue
For many one be soon weary
Of labor when it does them grieve
But such sothly be to repreue
But we shall soon se what labor
He can do / or that he remeue
To come to richesse and honor
The auctour.
Than pain to me approached nere
Bidding me labor dylygently
And that I should in each manner
Do my business well and wisely
Not sparynge my body nor my bones
And he that did not so truly
Should avoid that place at ones
I told her that I had desire
To work fast without feign
And for to follow her pleasyre
So that she should not complain
Saying I trusted to obtain
By my labor wealth and richesse
And that I should my setfe constrayne
To be nere Cure / and Business
Pain.
That is answered by good moyen
When travail my husbonde shall you se
The which is feeble and auncyen
Your work and labor shall he ouerse
Of him rewarded shall ye be
After your work and your labor
And in the mean time ye shall have me
Always ready at your socour
The auctour.
Than began I to labor fast
Employenge thereon pleasure and might
Contynuenge while the night did last
Than in the morning appeared light
In at a wyndowe that was bright
Than blewe I my candellout
Labourynge still with all my might
As other that were me about
Still to labor I did me cast
By suffraunce of the grace dyuyne
Unto the time of the brekefast
Where we had neither ale ne wine
They might not tarry for to dyne
So sure on labor was their purpose
Till labor caused them to declyne
By pain constrained so up they rose
They were all homely as companyons
Their labor gave them an appetyt real
Some ete garlyke / some ete onyons
Such service was among them all
Brown bread to them was cordyall
Wetynge it in the water clear
Drinking of the fountain clear as crystal
They had no scorn of this manner
There was neither befe ne moton
To ete when hunger did them assail
Such is the manner in this season
Some be rewarded ill their travail
They wrought in peace and in battle
Some etynge and labourynge both at ones
Not sparynge their body without fail
As chief laborers for the nones


When that I saw their condycyon
So prone to labor and business
I set mine hole and ferme entencyon
By such labor to get richesse
Than upon me came faintness
That I had lust to refresshe nature
When they me saw in such dystresse
I lacked no bread I you ensure
I would be of their company
And taking this bread with good will
I thereof bote right merely
Still workynge not thinking ill
I had no scorn me for to fill
With this bread but thereon bote
And after with chere meke and still
With fair water I washed my throat
I filled my belly fair and well
With this fair bread made of rye
Drinking always at the well
And yet still wrought I merely
I was as well at ease truly
As though I had had all deyntees
In the world / for certainly
To much is naught in all degrees
Shortly to say I was as full
As was conuenyent to nature
For excess makes the mind dull
I report me to business and cure
For often times man does murmr
When he is full of mete and wine
To all vice prone I the ensure
Excludynge him from the grace dyuyne
When I was thus refresshed well
I drew me to my work again
Good heart and good will did me tell
How I should do also certain
Lust to do good did me maintain
Thus drew I me unto business
I spared neither travail nor pain
Without falshode to get richesse

CVre and charge did me behold
Co^maundynge me to labor fast
And told me suerly that they would
Reward me truly at the last
So labored I till the day was past
And as I labored song I merely
Till hesperus clouds the day ouercast
And that the night approached nigh
Than cure vnbyden went a p^ce
And lightly lyghted a candell
She set it by my workynge place
And many new points to me did tell
She said who bydeth in this castle
After the commandment of reason
Must work unto the curfue knell
Considering the time and season
At her bidding I wrought still fast
Having therein delight and pleasoure
Till that the bell range at the last
Which was a conuenyent hour
Than hunger came with his rygour
Which cruelty did me assail
With that saw I come from a toure
The capytayne called travail
travail



Friend you art welcome unto this place
For thy labor true and dylygent
Which has brought the in to my grace
Therefore shall I give ye riches permanent
So after that thy youth is spent
I shall the promise and behest
After thy labor incontinent
Thou shalt come to the house of rest
Thou shalt have rest at thy desire
After thy pain and trybulacyon
Thou shalt sit merely by the fire
After that thy work is done
There shalt thou find consolacyon
After thy pain and thy travail
Thus shalt thou find in conclusyon
After pouerte rich apparayle
And therefore at one word shortly
Now do as thou thynkest best
For with good will the leave gyne I
For to go home unto thy rest
And thy prayer and thy request
I travail shall unto the promise
Go now thou shalt have my behest
After labor / that is richesse
The auctour.
Than took I leave of travail
Going to rest full of gladness
Than with hye voice withouten fail
I called the porter named business
Than to the gates I did me dress
The which were shytte than had I doubt
Yet showed I the porter such meekness
Than he agreed to let me out

Cure.



Business and cure his wife
Let me out at the gate mekely
Always me warning for bread of strife
On the mo^nynge to rise erly
My labor for to fynysshe parfytly
Saying all that I had done was naught
Without it were ended lightly
Wherefore thereon set thy thought
He said in the castle of richesse
No man can have any audyence
While he soiourneth with ydelnesse
The capytayne has given that sentence
But by the way of dylygence
One may right well obtain this place
Here may thou se in thy presence
By what hardness thou fell in grace
In labor must thou have perseueraunce
Avoiding great test that is so dangerous
Which brings wise men in to ygnoraunce
And to richesse is right contraryous
Avoid sloth which is so odyous
That of him comes naught but pouerte
Above all to falshode be contraryous
Despysynge his goods full of iniquyte
If thou him love sone I ensure the
Of my word may thou be certain
That thou offendest the deite
Of our lord and deseruest pain
Eternal / therefore the refrain
Fro this falshode in each degree
And if that sloth upon the feign
As poor as Job was shalt thou be
Without rest no man may live
For it is according to travail
But if in richesse if thou wyste^ preue
Rest not to much by my counsel
Remember this lesson se thou not fail
And to the intent thou forsake not this law
Not it forgetting / for thyn avail
By thyn ear I shall the draw
Cure.
My friend one can not aye endure
For to labor to his advantage
Therefore se thou thy self assure
To labor fast in thy young age
Infyre thy mind and thy courage
On reason and thou shalt have richesse
By ydelnesse thou do outrage
Both to the and all thy doutlesse
The auctour.
Than drew she mine ere again
As cure had done before doutlesse
And than vanysshed away certain
Leuynge me there full of faintness
Procedynge of my labor and business
Thus seeing them gone I thought it best
To refresshe nature without excess
And so drew me to the house of rest
I saw rest which did me abide
Within his house withouten blame
And my wife on the other side
Dressed my souper without dyffame
There rested I in gods name
Famylyarly not as a stranger
Thanking god of immortal fame
That I escaped was that danger
The house of rest


Unto the table I went that tide
Entendynge to soupe without outrage
My wife sat on the other side
After my custom and old usage
There had we bread wine and potage
And of flesh a small proytaunce
Without to any hurt or damage
We souped together at our pleasaunce
My wife voyded the table clean
And unto me approached nere
Than on my shulder did she lene
After her custom and manner
There told I her of the daungere
Which I was in the night before
How that she slepte with merry chere
The while that I was troubled sore
I told her that in all my life
I had not so great peruersyte
Now in pleasure and now in strife
Tourmented fyersly felt I me
For falls Need / and Necessyte
With Pouerte / and her felawe Dystresse
Thought and heaviness with cruelte
Lay on my bed me to opresse
Dyscomforte and Dysesperaunce
Lay upon me with their treason
Ready to bring me to myschaunce
Or in the way of perdycyon
That had not ben my lady reason
Which me enfourmed to mine advantage
They had brought me unto confusyon
Or done to me some great outrage
Wisdom did greatly me profit
For I haunted his company
Which by his means made me quyte
Of falshode / dysceyte / and vsurye
Which three by their polecye
Had me nere brought to confusyon
But after again comfort had I
Of that wise lady called reason
To whom I have made homage
For the of her own benevolence
Has given me at brefe langage
Good heart and good will for my defense
Which have a child ay in my presence
Lust to do good named is he.
Ready to help me in all indygence
Out of pain and peruersyte
We went unto the castle of labor
Where was many an artyfycer
Cure stood at the gate that hour
Business her husbonde was porter
They received me with good chere
Travail was their capytayne
His wyfes name was called pain
There wrought I all day and night certain
With fre will and glad pleasaunce
To morrow must I return again
To this castle of fair ordinance
There found I but small pytaunce
But every man after his degree
After his labor had his fe
And therefore my well-beloved wife
Consider the pain and the travail
Which while ye slepte without strife
Right cruelly did me assail
But now am I well without fail
Sith I have escaped this daungere
And in your presence may appear
My wife thereof cared no thing
But leughe me to derysyon
She scorned me and my talking
For were it winning or perdycyon
It was to her all one conclusyon
For so she were served at her desire
She cared not if I lay in the mire
She called me fool and cared naught
And was nere ready with me to fight
She swore by god that her dear bought
She would make me remember that night
Therefore I went to bed even right
For the thyre foted stole fore fered I
To that with a woman it is but folly
A man should take no head at all
To what someuer a woman say
Of her tunge she is lyberall
It is no wisdom her to denay
In peace may he be by no way
That would still a woman / it is contrary
She is a publyke and common secretary
Who ever he be that has a wife
Had need for to have paryence
Or else must he live always in stryse
Though she be bound to obedyence
Yet does she after her own sentence
I dare no more say for dread of blame
That man is happy that one can tame
On this point I made we ready
And so went to my bed full right
Where I slepte still and merely
Cyll four of the clock after mydnyght
Than up I rose by the candell light
Thinking on cure and business
And to my work soon bide I me dress
Ay prayenge god by his ordinance
That if I may not obtain richesse
That I may purchase suffysaunce
Which is my lady and my maysteresse
To enfourme me to live in symplenesse
So that after this lyse mortal
I may rejoice the realm eternal
Actoris excusatio.
GO forth small treatise and humbly the present
Unto the reders as indygne of audyence
Exortynge them with meke and low intent
To this rude langage to give none aduertence
For many one has parfyte dylygence
Which by no mean his mind can express
The cause thereof is lack of eloquence
Which now is caduke by mean of slothfulness
The young child is not all parfyte
To renew when he can neither crepe nor go
But when he begins he has great delight
In his new science / wherefore he has great woe
Endurynge falls with many pains mo
Thus such pain so long does he endure
And to him self he entendeth so
That of his fete he is parfyte and sure
So certainly in such case am I
Somewhat assayenge if I can ensue
The steps of them the which craftily
All vice of writing utterly eschew
But ygnoraunce right often does me subdue
And often I fall for lack of exercise
This rude langage so on me both renew
That I again uneaths may arise
The cause why I follow not these orators
Is for lack of intellygence
And that I have not smelled of the flowers
Spryngynge in the gardyn of parfyte eloquence
Wherefore with humble and meke obedyence
I submytte me to the correccyon
Of them whom minerua with her science
Has endued this is my conclusyon
Thus ends the castle of labor wherein is richesse / virtue / and honor.
