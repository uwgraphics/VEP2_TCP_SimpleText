AMICO SVO CANDIDO ET CORDATO, JOHANNES MARSTON MVSARVM ALVMNVS

ASPERAM HANC SVAM THALIAM D. D.

To the Reader.
I Am an ill Orator; and in truth, use to indite more honestly then
eloquently, for it is my custom to speak as I think, and write as I speak.

In plainness therefore understand, that in some things I have willingly
erred, as in supposing a Duke of Genoa, and in taking names different from that
Cities families: for which some may wittily accuse me, but my defense shall
be as honest, as many reproves unto me have been most malicious. Since (I
heartily protest) it was my care to write so far from reasonable offense, that
even strangers, in whose State I laid my Scene, should not from thence draw any
disgrace to any, dead or living. Yet in despite of my indevors, I understand,
some have bin most unadvisedly over-cunning in mis-interpreting me, and with
subtilty (as deep as hell) have maliciously spread ill rumors, which springing
from themselves, might to themselves have heavily returned. Surely I desire to
satisfy every firm spirit, who in all his actions, proposes to himself no
more ends then God and virtue do, whose intentions are always simple: to such
I protest, that with my free understanding, I have not glanced at disgrace of
any, but of those, whose unquiet studies labor innovation, contempt of holy
policy, reverent comely superiority, and established unity: for the rest of my
supposed tartness, I fear not, but unto every worthy mind t'wil be approoved
so general and honest, as may modestly pass with the freedom of a Satyr. I
would feign leave the paper; only one thing afflicts me, to think that
Scenes invented, merely to be spoken, should be inforcively published to be
read, and that the least hurt I can receive, is to do my self the wrong. But
since others otherwise would do me more, the least inconvenience is to be
accepted. I have my self therefore set forth this Comedy; but so, that my
enforced absence must much rely upon the Printers discretion: but I shall
entreat, slight errors in orthography may be as slightly or'epassed; and that
the unhandsome shape which this trifle in reading presents, may be pardoned,
for the pleasure it once afforded you, when it was presented with the soul of
lively action.

THE MALCONTENT.
ACTVS PRIMVS.
Vexat censu^a columb^s.
SCE. PRIMA.
The vilest out of tune Music being heard. Ent^r Bilioso and Praepasso.
Bilioso. WHy how now? are ye mad? or drunk? or both? or what?


Prae^. Are ye building Babylon there?


(...) Here Is a noise in Court* you think you are in a Tavern, do you not?


Pr^p. You think you are in a bro^hell house do you not? This room is ill
sented.

Enter one with a Perfume. So; perfume; perfume; some upon me I pray thee: The
Duke is upon instant entrance; so, make place there.


SCENA SECVNDA.
Enter the Duke Pietro, Ferrardo, Count Equato, Count Celso before, and (...).
Pietro. Where breath's that Music?


Bilioso. The discord rather then the Music is heard from the Malcontent
Maleuoles (...) ^


Ferrar. Maleuole.


Male. Out of his Chamber.
Yaugh, godaman what do thou there: Dukes Ganimed Iunces jealous of thy long
stockings: shadow of a woman, what would Weesell? thou lamb a Court: what
do thou bleat for? a you smooth chind Ca^amite.


Pietro. Come down thou rugged Cur, and snarle here, I give thy dogged
sullenness free liberty: trot about and be-spurtle whom thou please.


Maleuole. I Will come among you, you Gotish bloudded Toderers, as Gum into
Taffata, to fret, to fret: I Will fall like a sponge into water to suck up; to
suck up. Howl again. I Will pray, and come to you.


Pietr^. This Maleuole is one of the most prodigious affections that ever
conuerst with nature; A man or rather a monster; more discontent then Lucifer
when he was thrust out of the presence, his appetite is insatiable as the
Grave; as far from any content as from heaven, his highest delight is to
procure others vexation, and therein he thinks he truly se^ues heaven; for
it is his position, whosoever in this ^arth can be contented is a slave and
damned; therefore does he afflict all in that to which they are most affected;
the Elements struggle within him; his own soul is at varience; his speech is
halter-worthy at all hours; I like him faith, he gives good intelligence to my
spirit, makes me understand those weaknesses which others flattery palliate:
hark they sing.


SCENA TERTIA.
A Song. Enter Maleuole after the Song. See he comes; now shall you hear the
extremity of a Malecontent: he is as free as air; he blows over every man.
And sir whence come you now?

Mal. From the public place of much dissimulation;


Piet. What did there?


Mal. Talk with a Usurer; take up at Intetest.


Piet. I wonder what religion thou art?


Mal. Of a Soldiers religion.


Pietr. And what do thou think makes most Infidels now?


Mal. Sects, sects, I have seen seeming Piety change her roabe so often, that
sure none but some arch-diuell can shape her a new Peticote.


Pietro. Of a religious policy.


Mal. But damnation on a politic religion.


Pietro. But what is the common news abroad Maleuole, thou dogst rumor still.


Mal. Common news? why common words are, God save ye, Fare ye well: common
actions, Flattery and Cosenage: common things, Women and Cuckolds: and how does
my little Ferrard: a ye lecherous Animal, my little Ferret, he goes sucking
up and down the Palace into every Hens nest like a Weesell: and to what do
thou addict thy time to now, more then to those Antique painted drabs that are
still affected of young Courtiers, Flattery, Pride and Ven^ry.


Ferrard. I study languages: who do think to be the best linguist of our
age?


Mal. Phew, the Devil let him possess thee, heel teach thee to speak all
languages, most readily and strangely, and great reason mary, he is traueld
greatly ithe world; and is every where.


Ferrard. Save ith Court.


M^l. I save ith Court: and how does my old Muckill ouerspred with fresh snow*
thou half a man half a Goat, To Bilios^.
all a Beast: how does thy young wife old huddle?


Bili^. Out you improuident rascal.


Mal. Do, kick thou hugely hornd old Dukes Ox, good Master Make-pleece.


Pietro. How do thou live now a days Maleuole?


Mal. Why like the Knight S. Patrik Penlobrans, with killing a Spiders for my
Ladies Munckey.


Pie. How do spend the night, I here thou never sleepst?


Mal. O no, but dream the most fantastical: O heaven: O fubbery, fubbery.


Pietro. Dream, what dreamst?


Mal. Why me thinks I see that Signior pawnd his footcloth, that Metreza her
Plate, this madam takes physic, that the other Mounsieur may minister to her:
here is a Pandar Ieweld: there a fellow in shift of Satin this day, that could
not shift a shirt the other night, here a Paris supports that Hellen, there is a
Lady Guineuer bears up that sir Lancelot. Dreams, dreams, visions,
fantasies, Chimeras, imaginations, tricks, conceits, To Prepass^.
Sir Tristram Trimtram come a loft lack a napes with a whim wham, here is a
Knight of the land of Catito shall play at trap with any Page in Europe; Do
the sword dance, with any Morris*dauncer in Christendom; ride at the Ring
till the finne of his eyes look as blew as the welkin, and run the
wilde-goose chase even with Pompey the huge.


Pietro. You run.


Mal. To the devil: now Signor Guerchino; that thou from a most pitied
prisoner should grow a most loathd flatterer: Alas poor Celso, thy stars
oppressed, thou art an honest Lord, it is pity.


Equato. Is It pity?


Mal. I marry is it Philosophical Equato, and it is pity that thou being so
excellent a Scholar by Art, should be so riculous a fool by Nature: I have
a thing to tell you Duke; bid vm auant, bid vm auant.


Pietro. Leave us, leave us, now sir what is it?


Exeunt all saving Pietro and Maleuole Mal. Duke thou art a Beco, a Corn^to.


Pietro. How?


Mal. Thou art a Cuckold.


Pietro. Speak; vnshale him quick.


Mal. With most tumbler-like nimblenes.


Pietro. Who? by whom? I burst with desire.


Mal. Mendozo is the man makes thee a horned beast; Duke it is Mendozo cornutes
thee.


Pietro. What conformance, relate, short, short.


Mal. As a Lawyers beard,

There is an old Crone in the Court, her name is Maquerelle,
She is my Mistress sooth to say, and she does ever tell me,
Blirt a rhyme; blirt a rhyme; Maquerelle is a cunning Bawd, I am an honest
villain, thy wife is a close Drab, and thou art a notorious Cuckold, farewell
Duke.


Pietro. Stay* stay.


Mal, Dull, dull Duke, can lazy patience make lame revenge; O God for a woman
to make a man that which God never created, never made.


Pietro. What did God never make?


Mal. A Cockold: To be made a thing that's hud-winkt with kindness whilst every
rascal philips his brows; to have a Cox-combe with egregious horns pind to a
Lords back, every page sporting himself with delightful laughter, whilst he
must be the last must know it; Pistols and Poniards, Pistols and Poinards.


Pietro. Death and damnation.


Mal. Lightning and thunder.


Pietro. Vengeance and torture.


Mal. Catzo.


Pietro. O revenge.


Mal. I would dam him and all his generation, my own hands should do it; ha I
would not trust heaven with my vengeance any thing.


Pietro. Any thing, any thing Maleuole thou shall see instantly what temper my
spirit houlds; farewell, remember, I forget thee not, farewell.


Exit Pietro. SCENA QVARTA.
Enter Celso. Cel. My honored Lord.


Mal. Peace, speak low; peace, O Celso, constant Lord,
Thou to whose faith I only rest discovered,
Thou one of full ten millions of men
That love virtue only for it self,
Thou in whose hands old OPS may put her soul;
Behold for ever banished Altofront
This Genoas last years Duke. O truly noble,
I wanted those old instruments of state,
Dissemblance, and suspect: I could not time it Celso,
My throane stood like a point in amidst of a circle,
To all of equal neerenes, bore with none:
Raind all alike, so slept in fearelesse virtue,
Suspectles, too suspectles, till the crowde:
(Still liquerous of untried novelties)
Impacient with seuerer gouernmente:
Made strong with Florence: banished Altofront.

Celso. Strong with Florence, I thence your mischief rose,
For when the danghrer of the Florentine:
Was matched once with this Pietro now Duke,
No stratagem of state vnt^ide was left, till you of all

Mal. Of all was quite berefte,
Alas Maria too close prisoned:
My true sayth'd duchess in the Citadell.

Celso. I Will still adhere, lets mutiny and die.


Mal. O clime not*a falling tower Celso,
It Is well held desperation, no Zeal:
Hopeles to strive with fate (peace) Temporize.
Hope, hope, that never forsak'st the wretchedst man,
Yet bidst me live, and lurk in this disguise,
What play I well the ^ree breathed discontent,
Why man we are all philosophical monarkes or natural fools, Celso the
Courts a ^ar, the duchess sheets will smoke forth ere it be long: Impure
Mendozo that sharp nosed Lord, that made the cursed match linkt Genoa with
Florence now broad horns, the Duke which he now knows: Discord to
malcontents is very Manna, when the ranks are burst* then scuffle Altophant.


Celso. I but durst.


Mal. It Is gone, it is swallowed like a mineral, some way twill work, phewt i will
not shrink,

He Is resolute who can no lower sink.


Celso. Yonder Is Mendoza.


Mal. True, the privy key.


Celso. I take my leave sweet Lord.


Exit Celso. Mal. It Is fit, away.


SCENA QVINTA.
Enter Mendoza with three or four suitors. Mend. Leave your suites with me, I
can and will: attend my secretary, leave me.


Mal. Mendoza hark ye, hark ye, You are a treacherous villain, God buy
ye.


Mend. Out you base borne rascal.


M^l. We are all the sons of heaven though a Tripe wife were our mother; a
you whore-sonne hot rainde he Marmoset, Egistus did ever here of one Egistus?


Mend. Gistus?


Mal. I Egistus, he was a filthy incontinent Fleshmonger, such a one as thou
art.


Mend. Out grumbling roage.


Mal. Orestes, beware Orestes.


Mend. Out beggar.


Mal. I once shall rise,


Mend. Thou rise?


Mal. I at the resurrection.
No vulgar seed but once may rise and shall,
No King so huge, but fore he die may fall.

Exit. Mend. Now good Elysium, what a delicious heaven is it for a man to be in
a Princes favor? o sweet God, o pleasure! o Fottune! o all thou best of life?
what should I think? what say? what do? to be a favorite? a minion? to have a
general timorous respect* observe a man, a statefull scilence in his presence:
solitariness in his absence, a confused ham and busy murmr of obsequious
suitors training him; the cloth held up, and way proclaimd before him;
Petitionarie vassailes licking the pauement with their slavish knees, whilst
some odd palace Lampreeles that engender with Snakes, and are full of eyes on
both sides with a kind of insinuating humbleness fix all their lights upon
his browe: O blessed state what a rauishing prospect does the Olympus of favor
yield; Death, I cornute the Duke: sweet women, most sweet Ladies, nay Angels;
by heaven he is more accursed then a Devil that hates you, or is hated by you,
and happier then a God that loves you, or is beloved by you; you preseruers of
mankind, life blood of society, who would live, nay who can live without you? O
Paradise, how maiesticall is your austerer presence? how imperiously chaste is
your more modest face? but O! how full of rauishing attraction is your pretty,
petulant, languishing, laciuiously-composed countenance: these amarous smiles,
those soule-warming sparkling glances; ardent as those flames that singed the
world by heedlesse Phaeton; in body how delicate, in soul how witty, in
discourse how pregnant, in life how wary, in favors how iud^ious, in day how
sociable, and in night how? O pleasure vn^tterable, indeed it is most certain,
one man cannot deserve only to enjoy a beauteous woman: but a Duchess? in
dispight of Phoebus I Will write a Sonnet instantly in praise of her.


Exit. SCENA SEXTA.
Enter Farnese vshering Aurelia, Emillia and Maquerelle bearing up her train,
Beancha attending: all go out but Aurelia, Maquerelle and Farneze. Aure. And
is it possible? Mendozo slight me, possible?


Far. Possible? what can be strange in him that's drunk with favor,
Groes insolent with grace, speak Maquerelle, speak.

Maque. To speak feelingly, more, more richely in sollid sense then worthless
words, give me those Jewels of your ears to receive my enforced duty, as for
my part it is well known I can put up any thing; can bear patiently with any
man: But when I heard he wronged your precious sweetness, I was enforced to
take deep offense; It Is most certain he loves Emillia with high appetite; and
as she told me (as you know we women impart our secrets one to another) when
she repulsed his suite, in that he was possessed with your indeered grace:
Mendozo most ingratfully renounced all faith to you.


Fer. Nay, called you, speak Maquerelle, speak.


Maq. By heaven witch? dride bisquet, and contested blushlesly he loved you
but for a spurt or so.


Fer. For maintenance.


Maq. Advancement and regard.


Aur. O villain? O impudent Mendozo.


Maq Nay he is the rustiest iawde, the fowlest mouthd knave in railing against
our sex: he will rail again women.


Aur. How? how?


Maq. I am ashamed to speakt, I.


Aur. I love to hate him, speak.


Maq. Why when Emillia scornde his base vnsteddines the black throated rascal
scoulded, and sedd.


Aur. What?


Maq. Troth it is too shameless,


Aur. What said he?


Maq. Why that at four women were fools, at fourteen Drabbes, at forty
Bawdes, at fourscore witches, and a hundredth Cats.


Aur. O vnlimitable impudency!


Fer. But as for poor Fernezes fixed heart,
Was never shadelesse meadow drier parcht,
Under the scortching heat of heavens dog,
Then is my heart with your enforcing eyes.

Maq. A hot simile.


Fer. Your smiles have bin my heaven, your frowns my hell,
O pity then; Grace should with beauty d well.

Maq. Reasonable perfect bir-lady.


Aur. I will love thee, be it but in dispight,
Of that Mendozo, witch! Farneze, witch!
Ferneze thou art the Duchess favorite,
Be faithful, private, but it is dangerous,

Fer. His love is liuelesse, that for love fears breath,
The worst that's due to sin, O would't were death.

Aur. Enjoy my favor, I will be sick instantly and take physic,
Therefore in depth of night, visit

Maq. Visit her chamber, but conditionally you shall not offend her bed: by
this Diamond.


Fer. By this Diamond.


Gives it to Maquerelle. Maq. Nortary longer then you please: by this Ruby.


Fer. By this Ruby.


Maq. And that the door shall not creake.


Fer. And that the door shall not creake.


Mal. Nay but swear.


Fern. By this purse.


Maq. Go to, I Will keep your oaths for you: remember, visit.


Enter Mendozo reading a Sonnet. Aur. Dried bisquet? look where the base
wretch comes.


Men. Beauties life, Heavens model, Loves Queen.


Maq. That's his Aemilia.


Men. Natures triumph, best of Earth.


Maq. Meaning Emillia.


Mend. Thou only wonder that the world has seen.


Maq. That's Emilia.


Aur. Must I then here her praisd? Mendozo.


Mend. Madam, your excellency is graciously incountred; I have bin writing
passionate flashes in honor of --


Exit Fer. Aur. Out villain, villain, O judgment where have bin my eyes?
what bewitched election made me doat on thee? what sorcery made me love thee?
but be gone, bury thy head; O that I could do more then loath thee: Hence
worst of ill, No reason else, my reason is my will.


Exit with Maquer. Mend. Women? nay furies, nay worse, for they torment Only
the bad, but women good and bad.

Damnation of mankind, breath have thou praisd them for this: And is it you
Ferneze are wrigled into smock grace; fit sure, O that I could rail against
these monsters in nature, models of hell, curse of the earth, women that dare
attempt any thing, and what they attempt they care not how they accomplish,
without all premeditation or prevention; rash in asking, desperate in working,
impatient in suffering, extreme in desiring, slaves unto appetite, mistresses
in dissembling, only constant in inconstancy, only perfect in
cou^terfetting: their words are fained, their eyes forged, their sights
dissembled, their looks counterfeit, their hair false, their given hopes
deceitful, their very breath artificial:

Their blood is their only God: Bad clothes, and old age are only the Devils
they tremble at:

That I could rail now.


SCENA SEPTIMA.
Enter Pietro his sword drawn. Pietro. A mischief fill thy throat, thou
foul iaw'd slaue^ Say thy prayers.


Mend. I ha forgot vm.


Pietro. Thou shall dye.


Mend. So shall thou; I am heart mad.


Pietro. I am horn mad.


Mend. Extreme mad.


Pietro. Monstrously mad.


Mend. Why?


Pietro. Why? thou thou have dishonored my bed.


Mend. I? come, come, sit, heeres my bare heart to thee as steady as is this
center to this glorious world,

And yet hark thou art a Cornuto; but by me?


Pietro. Yes slave by thee.


Mend. Do not, do not with tart and spleenefull breath,
Loose him can loose thee; I offend my Duke?
Bare record O ye dumb and raw aird nights,
How vigilant my sleeplesse eyes have bin,
To watch the Traitor; record thou spirit of truth,
With what debasement I ha throne my self,
To under offices, only to learn
The truth, the party, time, the means, the place,
By whom, and when* and where thou were disgraced:
And am I paid with slave? has my intrusion
To places private, and prohibited,
Only to observe the closer passages:
Heaven knows with vows of revelation,
Made me suspected, made me deemd a villain?
What roage has wronged us?

Pietro. Mendozo, I may err.


Mend. Err? it is too mild a name, but err and err,
Run giddy with suspect, fore through me thou know,
That which most creatures save thy self do know,
Nay since my service has so loathed reject,
Fore I Will reveal, shall find them clipped together.

Piet. Mendozo thou know I am a most plain brested man.


Mend. The fitter to make a Cornuto, would your brows were most plane to.


Piet. Tell me, indeed I heard thee rail?


Mend. At women, true, why what cold fleame could chose,
Knowing a Lord so honest, virtuous,
So boundless loving, bounteous, fair shapt, sweet,
To be contemned, abused, defamed, made Cuckold,
Heart, I hate all women for it: sweet sheets, wax lights, Antique bed-posts,
Cambrick smocks, villainous curtains, Arras pictures, oylde hinges, and all ye
tong-tide lascivious witnesses of great creatures wantonness: what salvation
can you expect?


Piet. Will thou tell me?


Mend. Why you may find it your self, observe, observe.


Piet. I ha not the patience, will thou deserve me; tell, give it.


Mend. Take It, why Farneze is the man, Ferneze, I Will proou't, this night you
shall take him, in your sheets, wilt serve.


Piet. It will, my bozomes in some peace, till night.


Mend. What?


Piet. Farewell.


Mend. God how weak a Lord are you,
Why do you think there is no more but so?

Piet. Why?


Mend. Nay then will I presume to council you,
It should be thus; you with some guard upon the sudden
Break into the Princes chamber, I stay behind
Without the door, through which he needs must pass,
Ferneze flies, let him, to me he comes, he is killed
By me, observe by me, you follow, I rail,
And seem to save the body: Duchess comes
On whom (respecting her advanced birth,
And your fair nature) I know, nay I do know
No violence must be used. She comes, I storm,
I praise, excuse Ferneze, and still maintain
The Duchess honor, she for this loves me,
I honor you, shall know her soul, you mine,
Then naught shall she contriue in vengeance,
(As women are most thoughtfull in revenge)
Of her Ferneze, but you shall sooner know it
Then she can think it, thus shall his death come sure,
Your Duchess braine-caught; so your life secure.

Piet. It is too well, my bozome, and my heart,
When nothing helps, cut of the rotten part.

Exit. Mend. Who cannot feign friendship, can nere produce the effects of
hatred: Honest fool Duke, subtle lascivious Duchess, silly nouice ferneze; I
do laugh at ye, my brain is in labor till it produce mischief, and I feel
sudden thro's, proofs sencible, the issue is at hand.

As Bears shape young, so I Will form my device,
Which grown proves horrid: Vengeance makes men wise.

ACTVS SECVNDVS.
SCE. PRIMA.
Enter Mendozo with a Scene, to observe Fernezes entrance, who whilst the Act
is playing: Enter unbraced 2. Pages before him with lights, is met by
Maquerelle and conuaide in. The Duchess Pages sent away. Men. He Is caught, the
Woodcocks head is in the noose,
Now treads Ferneze in dangerous path of lust,
Swearing his sense is merely deified.
The fool grasps clouds, and shall beget Centaures.
And now in strength of panting faint delight,
The Goat bids heaven envy him; good Goose,
I can afforde thee nothing but the poor comfort of calamity, Pity.
Lusts like the plummets hanging on clock lines,
Will nere a done till all is quite is undone.
Such is the course salt sallow lust does run.
Which thou shall try; I Will be revenged. Duke thy suspect,
Duchess thy disgrace, Ferneze thy riuall-ship,
Shall have swift vengeance, nothing so holy,
No band of nature so strong,
No law of friendship so sacred,
But i will profane, burst, violate
Fore i will endure disgrace: contempt and poverty:
Shall I whose very humme, struck all heads bare,
Whose face made scilence: creaking of whose shoe,
Forced the most private passages fly open,
Scrape like a servile dog at some latch'd door?
Learn now to make a leg? and cry beseech ye,
Pray ye is such a Lord within? be awed
At some odd vshers scoft formality?
First sear my brains: Unde cadis non quo refert.
My heart cries perish all, how? how? what fate?
Can once avoid revenge, that's desperate,
I Will to the Duke, if all should open, if? tush
Fortune still dotes on those who cannot blush.

SCENA SECVNDA.
Enter Maleuole at one door, Beancha, Emillia and Maquerelle at the other
door. Mal. Bless ye cast a Ladies; ha Dipsas, how do thou old Cole.


Maq. Old Cole?


Mal. I old Cole, me thinks thou lie like a brand under these billets of
green wood.

He that will inflame a young wenches heart, let him lay close to her, an old
Cole that has first bin fierd a pandresse, my half burnt lynt, who though
thou can not flame thy self yet art able to set a 1000. virgins tapers a
fiar: and how does Ianiuere thy husband, my little periwincle: is a trobled
with the cough a the Lunges still, does he hawke anights still, he will not
bite.


Bean. No by my troth, I took him with his mouth empty of old teeth.


Mal. And he^ took thee with thy belly full of young bones, marry he took his
maime by the stroke of his enemy.


Bean. And I mine by the stroke of my freinde:


Mal. The close stock, o mortal wench: Lady ha ye now no restoratiues for
your decayed Jason, look ye, Crabs guts baked, distilled Oxe-pith, the
puluerized hairs of a Lions upper lip, gelly of Cock-sparrowes, He Monkeis
marrow, or powder of Foxe-stones; and whither are all you ambling now?


Beanc. Why to bed, to bed.


Mal. Do your husbands lie with ye?


Bean. That were country fashion in faith.


Mal. Ha ye no foregoers about you; come, whither in good deed law now?


Maq. In good indeed law now, to eat the most miraculously, admirably,
astonishable composed Posset with three Curds, without any drink: will ye
help me with a He Fox: here is the Duke.


Exeunt Ladies. SCENA TERTIA.
Enter Duke Pietro, Count Celso, Count Equato, Bilioso, Ferrard, and Mendozo.
Piet. The night grows deep and foul, what hour is it?


Celso. Upon the stroke of twelve.


Mal. Save ye Duke.


Piet. From thee, begone I do not love thee, let me see thee no more, we are
displeasd.


Mal. Why God buy thee, heaven hear my curse,
May thy wife and thee live long together.

Piet. Be gone sir.


Mal. When Arthur first in Court began, -- Agamennon, Menelaus, -- was ever any
Duke a Cornuto,


Piet. Begone hence.


Mal. What religion will thou be of next?


Mend. Out with him.


Mal. With most servile patience, time will come,
When wonder of thy error will strike dumb,
Thy beseld sense, slaves I favor, I marry shall he rise,
Good God how subtle Hell does flatter vice,
Mount him aloft, and makes him seem to fly,
As foul the Tortois mocked: who to the sky,
The Ambitious shell fish raised, the end of all,
Is only that from height he might dead fall.

Exit. Piet. It shall be so.


Mend. It must be so, for where great States revenge,
It Is requisite, the parts with piety
And soft respect forbeares, be closely dogd,
Lay one into his breast shall sleep with him,
Feed in the same dish, run in self faction,
Who may disseuer any shape of danger,
For once disgraced, discovered in offense,
It makes man blushlesse, and man is (all confess)
More prone to vengeance then to gratefulness.
Favors are writ in dust, but stripes we feel,
Depraved nature stamps in lasting steel.

Piet. You shall be leauged with the Duchess.


Equat. The plot is very good.


Mend. You shall both kill, and seem the course to save.


Ferrard. A most fine brain trick.


Celso. Of a most cunning knave.


Pietro. My Lords: The heavy action we intend
Is death and shame, two of the vgliest shapes
That can confound a soul, think, think of it;
I strike but yet like him that against stone walls,
Directs his shaftes, rebounds in his own face,
My Ladies shame is mine, O God, it is mine.
Therefore I do conjure all secrecy,
Let it be as very little as may be; pray ye, as may be;
Make frightlesse entrance, salute her with soft eyes,
Stain naught with blood, only Ferneze dies,
But not before her brows: O Gentlemen
God knows I love her, nothing else, but this
I am not well; if grief that sucks veins dry,
Riuels the skin, casts ashes in men's faces,
Be-duls the eye, vnstrengthens all the blood,
Chance to remove me to an other world,
As sure I once must dye: let him succeed:
I have no child, all that my youth begot,
Has bin your loves, which shall inherit me,
Which as it ever shall, I do conjure it
Mendozo may succeed, he is nobly borne;
With me of much desert.

Celso. Much.


Pietro. Your silence answers I,
I thank you, come on now, o that I might dye,
Before her shames displaide, would I were forced
To burn my fathers Tomb; vnhill his boanes,
And dash them in the dirt, rather then this:
This both the living and the dead offends,
Sharp surgery where naught but death amends.

Exit with others. SCENA QVARTA.
Enter Maquerelle, Emillia and Beanca, with a Posser. Maq. Even here it is,
three curds in three regions indiuiduallie distinct,
Most methodically according to art compos^d, without any drink.

Bean. Without any drink.


Maq. Upon my honor, will ye sit and eat.


Emil. Good the composure the recei^e, how is it:


Maq. It Is a pretty pearl, by this pearl, (how do with me) thus it is,
seven and thirty vo^lks of Barbary hens eggs, eighteen spoonfulles and a
half of the Ioice of cocksparrowe bon s, one ounce, three drams, ^oure
scruples, and one quarte^ of the Sirrop of Ethiopian Dates, sweetened with three
quarters of a pound of pure Candid Indian (...), strow'd over with the powder
of Pearl of America, Amber of Cataia, and Lamb stones of (...).


Bean. Trust me the ingredients are very Cordial, and no question go^d, and
most powerful in operation.


Maq. I know not what you mean by restauracion, but this it does, it purifieth
the blood, smootheth the skin, i^lifeneth the eye, strengthens the veins*
mundefieth the teeth, comfort the stomach, fortifieth the back, and
quickneth the wi^, that's all.


Emil By my troth I have eaten but two spoonefuls, and me thinks I could
discourse most swiftly, and wittily already.


Maq. Have you the art to seem honest.


Bean. I thank advise and practice.


Maq. Why then eat me a this posset, quicken your blood, and preserve your
beauty, do you know Doctor Plaster-face, by this curd he is the most
exquisite in forging of veins, sprightning of eyes, dying of hair, sleeking
of skins, blushing of cheeks, surpheling of breasts, blanching and bleaching
of teeth, that ever made an old lady gracious by torch-light: by this curd
law.


Bean. Well we are resolved, what God has given us weell cherish.


Maq. Cherish any thing saving your husband, keep him not too high least he
leap the pale: but for your beauty, let it be your Saint, bequeath two hours
to it every morning in your closet, I ha bin young, and yet in my conscience I
am not above five and twenty, but believe me, preserve and use your beauty, for
youth and beauty once gone, we are like Beehiues without honey: out a fashion,
apparel that no man will wear, therefore use me your beauty.


Emil. I but men say.


Maq. Men say, let men say what the will, life a woman, they are ignorant of
our wants, the more in years the more in perfection the grow: if they loose
youth and beauty, they gain wisdom and discretion: But when our beauty fades,
godnight with us, there cannot be an vglier thing to see then an old woman,
from which, o pruning, pinching, and painting, deliver all sweet beauties.


Bean. Hark music.


Maq. Peace it is ithe Duchess bedchamber, good rest most prosperously graced
ladies.


Emil. God night centinell.


Bean, Night dear Maquerelle.


Exeunt at several doors. Maq. May my possets operation send you my wit and
honesty,
And me your youth and beauty, the pleasingst rest.

standing ready to murder Ferneze as he flies from the Duchess chamber. All.
Strike, strike. Tumult within.



Aur. Save my Ferneze, o save my Ferneze.


Enter Ferneze in his shirt, and is receiud upon Mendoz. sword. All. Follow,

Aur. O save Ferneze.


Mend. Pierce, pierce, thou shallow fool drop there,
He that attempts a Princes lawless love,
Must have broad hands, close heart with Argos eyes,
And back of Hercules, or else he dies.

Enter Aurelia, Duke Pietro, Ferrard, Bilioso, Celso and Equato. All. Follow,
follow,


Mend. Stand off, forbear, ye most uncivil Lords. Mendozo bestrids the
vvounded body of Ferneze and seems to save him.



Piet. Strike.


Mend. Do not; tempt not a man resolved;
Would you inhumane murderers more then death?

Aur. O poor Ferneze.


Mend. Alas now all defense too late.


Aur. He Is dead.


Piet. I am sorry for our shame, go to your bed,
Weep not too much, but leave some tears to shed
When I am dead?

Aur. What weep for thee? my soul no tears shall find.


Piet. Alas, alas, that women's souls are blind.


Mend. Betraye such beauty? murder such youth? contemn civility,
He loves him not that railes not at him.

Piet. Thou can not move us, we have blood enough;
And please you Lady we have quite forgot
All your defects: if not, why then

Aur. Not.


Piet. Not: the best of rest, good night.


Exit Pietro with other Courtiers. Aur. Despite go with thee.


Mend. Madam, you ha done me soul disgrace,
You have wronged him much, loves you too much.
Go to; your soul knows you have.

Aur. I think I have.


Mend. Do you but think so?


Aur. Nay sure I have, my eyes have witnessed thy love,
Thou have stood too firm for me.

Mend. Why tell me fair checked Lady, who even in tears
Art powerfully beauteous, what unadvised passion
Struck ye into such a violent heat against me,
Speak, what mischief wronged us? what devil injured us?
Speak?

Aur. That thing nere worthy of the name of man; Ferneze,
Ferneze swore thou love Emillia,
Which to advance, with most reproachful breath,
Thou both did blemish and denounce my love.

Mend. Ignoble Villain, did I for this bestride
Thy wounded limbs; for this? rank opposite
Even to my Sovereign: for this? O God for this?
Sunk all my hopes, and with my hopes my life,
Ripped bare my throat unto the hangmans Axe,
Thou most dishonored trunk -- Emillia?
By life I know her not -- Emillia?
Did you believe him?

Aur. Pardon me, I did.


Mend. Did you, and thereupon you graced him?


Aur. I did.


Mend. Took him to favor, nay even claspd with him?


Aur. Alas I did.


Mend. This night?


Aur. This night.


Mend. And in your lustful twines the Duke took you?


Aur. A most sad truth.


Mend. O God, O God, how we dull honest souls,
Heavy braind men, are swallowed in the bogs
Of a deceitful ground, whilst nimble bloods,
Light iointed spirits pent, cut good men's throats,
And escape alas, I am too honest for this age,
Too full of fleame* and heavy steadiness:
Stood still whilst this slave cast a noose about me;
Nay then to stand in honor of him, and her,
Who had even sliced my heart.

Aur. Come I did err, and am most sorry, I did err.


Mend. Why we are both but dead, the Duke hates us,

'' And those whom Princes do once groundly hate,
'' Let them provide to dye; as sure as fate,
'' Prevention is the heart of policy.

Aur. Shall we murder him.


Mend. Instantly?


Aur. Instantly, before he casts a plot,
Or further blaze my honors much known blot,
Lets murder him?

Mend. I would do much for you, will ye marry me?


Aur. I Will make thee Duke, we are of Medices,
Florence our friend, in court my faction
Not meanly strength* full; the Duke then dead,
We well prepared for change, the multitude
Irresolutely reeling, we in force,
Our party seconded, the kingdom mazde,
No doubt of swift success all shall be graced.

Mend. You do confirm me, we are resolute,
To morrow look for change, rest confident,
It Is now about the immodest waste of night,
The mother of moist dew with pall^d light,
Spreds gloomy shades about the nummed earth,
Sleep, sleep, whilst we contriue our michiefes birth,
This man i will get inhum'de, farewell, to bed,
I kiss thy pillow* dream, the duke is dead. Exit Aurelia.
So, so, good night, how fortune dotes on impudence,
I am in private the adopted son of yon good Prince,
I must be Duke, why if I must, I must,
Most silly Lord, name me? O heaven
I see God made honest fools, to maintain crafty knaves:
The duchess is wholly mine too; must kill her husband
To quit her shame, mutch: then marry her: I,
O ^ grow proud in prosperous treachery,
As wrestlers clip, so i will imbrac^ you all,
Not to support, but to procure your fall.

Enter Maleuole. Mal. God arrest thee.


Mend. At whose suite?


Mal. At the devils, ha you treacherous damnable monster,
How do* how do thou treacherous roage,
Ha ye^ rascal, I am banish the Court, Sir.

Mend. P^ethee lets be acquainted, I do love thee faith.


Mal. At your service, by the Lord law, shals go to supper, Lets be once drunk
together* and so unite a most virtuously strengt^ned friendship, shals H^gonot,
shals?


Mend. Wilt ^ll upon my chamber to morrow morn.


Mal. As a Raven to a dunghill, they say there is one dead here p^ickt for the
pride of the flesh.


Mend Fernez: there he is, prey thee bury him.


Mal. O most willingly, I mean to turn pure Rochell Churchman, I.


Mend. Thou Churchman, why? why?


Mal Because i will live lazely, fail upon authority, deny Kings supremacy in
things indifferent, and be a Pope in mine own parish.


Mend. Wherefore doo'st thou think Churches were made?


Mal. To scour Plough shar^ (...) (...) (...) plough up Altars:


Et nunc ^ges (...) (...)* Mend. Strange.


Mal. Nay monstrous, I ha seen a sumptuous steeple turned to a stinking
privy: more beastly, the sacredst place made a Dogs kenill: nay most
inhumane, the stoned coffins of long dead Christians burst up, and made
Hogstroughs.

Hic finis Priami. Shall I ha some sack, and cheese at thy chamber, Good night,

Fer. O a Surgion.


Mal. Hark lust cries for a surgion, what news from Limb How does the graund
cuckold Lucifer.


Fer. O help, help, conceal and save me.


Ferneze stirs and Male. helps him up and conuaies him away. Mal. Thy shame
more then thy wounds do grieve me far,
''Thy wounds but leave upon thy flesh some skarre:
''But fame near heales still ranckl's worse and worse,
''Such is of uncontrolled Lust the curse.
''Thinke what it is in lawless sheets to lie,
''But o Ferneze what in lust to die:
''Then thou that shame respects o fly converse,
''With women's eyes and lisping wantonness:
''Stick candells against a virgin walls white back,
''If they not burn, yet at the least they will black,
Come I Will convey thee to a private port,
Where thou shall live (O happy man) from court.
The beauty of the day begins to rize,
From whose bright form Nights heavy shadow flies.
Now gins (...) plots to work, the Scene grows full,
And craves (...) eyes who has a sollid Skull.

SCENA PRIMA.
Enter Pietro the Duke, Mendoz: Count Equato and Bilioso. Piet. It Is grown to
youth of day, how shall we wast this light?
My hart's more heavy then a tyrants crown.
Shall we go hunt? Prepare for field.

Exit Equa. Mend. Would ye could be merry.


Piet. Would God I could: Mendoza bid am have. Exit Mendo.
I would feign shift place, O vain relief.
'' Sad souls may well change place, but not change grief:
As Dear being struck fly through many soyles,
Yet still the shaft stick fast, so, A good old simile my honest Lord,
I am not much unlike to some sickman,
That long desired hurtful drink; at last
Swilles in and drinks his last, ending at once
Both life and thirst: O would I nere had known
My own dishonor: good God, that men should
Desire to search out that, which being found kills all
Their joy of life: to taste the tree of Knowledge,
And then be driven from out Paradise.
Can give me some comfort?

Bili. My Lord, I have some books which have been dedicated to my honor, and
I near read am, and yet they had very fine names: Physic for Fortune:
Lozinges of sanctified sincerity; very pretty works of Curats, Scriueners and
Schoolemaisters. Mary I remember one Seneca, Lucius Aneus Seneca.


Piet. Out upon him, he writ of Temperance and Fortitude, yet lived like a
voluptuous Epicure, and died like an effeminate coward. Have thee to Florence:
here take our Letters, see um sealed, away: report in private to the honored
duke his daughters forced disgrace, tell him at length we know too much, due
complaints advance.

There Is naught that's safe and sweet but Ignorance.


Exit Duke. SCENA SECVNDA.
Enter Maleuole in some freeze gown whilst Bilioso reads his Patent. Mal. I
cannot sleep my eyes ill neighboring lids
Will hold no fellowship: O thou pale sober night,
Thou that in sluggish fumes all sense do steep:
Thou that gives all the world full leave to play,
Vnbendst the feebled veins of sweatie labor;
The Gally-slaue, that all the toilesome day,
Tugges at his oar against the stubborn wave,
Straining his rugged veins; snores fast:
The stooping S^heman that does barbe the field,
Thou* makst wink sure: in night all creatures sleep,
Only the Malecontent, that against his fate,
Repines and quarrels, alas he is goodman tell-clock,
His sallow ^aw-bones sincke with wasting moan,
Whilst other^ beds are down, his pillowes stone.

Bili. Mal uole.


Mal. Elder of Izrael, thou honest defect of wicked nature and obstinate
ignorance, when did thy wife let thee lie with her?


Bili. I am going Ambassador to Florence.


Mal. Ambassador, now for thy countries honor, preethe do not put up Mutton
and Porredge i'thy clock bag: thy young lady wife goes to Florence with thee too
does she not?


Bili. No, I leave her at the Palace.


Mal. At the Palace? now discretion shield man, for Gods love lets ha no more
cuckolds, Hymen begins to put of his Saffron robe, keep thy wife in the state
of grace, heart a truth, I would sooner leave my lady singled in a Bordello,
then in the Genoa palace, sin there appearing in her sluttish shape Would
soon grow loath some, even to blushes sense,

Surfeit would cloak intemperare appetite,
Make the soul sent the rotten breath of lust.
When in an Italian lascivious Palace, a Lady gardianlesse.
Left to the push of all allurement,
The strongest incitements to immodestie,
To have her bound, incensed with wanton sweetes,
Her veins filled hie with heating delicates,
Soft rest, sweet Music, amorous Masquerers, lascivious banquets, sin it
self gilt ore, strong fantasy tricking up strange delights, presenting it
dressed pleasingly to sense, sense leading it unto the soul, confirmed with
potent example, impudent custom enticed by that great bawd opportunity, thus
being prepared, clap to her easy ear, youth in good clothes, well shapt,
rich, fair spoken, promising noble, ardent bloud-full, witty, flattering,
Ulysses absent, O Ith^ can chastest Penelope hold out.


Bil. Mass i will think on it farewell.


Exit Bilioso. Mal. Farewell, take thy wife with the, farewell,
To Florence, um? it may prove good, it may,
And we may once unmask our brows.

SCENA TERTIA.
Enter Count Celzo. Cel. My honored Lord.


Mal. Celso peace, how is it? speak lo, pale fears suspect that hedges, walls
and trees have ears, speak how runs all?


Cel. I faith my Lord, that beast with many heads,
The staggering multitude recoiles apace,
Though through great men's envy, most men's malice,
Their much intemperate heat has banished you.
Yet now they faind envy and malice near,
Produce faint reformation.
The Duke, the too soft Duke lies as a block,
For which two tugging factions seem to saw,
But still the Iron through the ribs they draw.

Mal. I tell thee Celzo, I have ever found
Thy breast most far from shifting cowardice
And fearful baseness: therefore i will tell thee Celzo,
I find the wind begins to come about,
I Will shift my suit of fortune, I know the Florentine whose only force,
By marying his proud daughter to this Prince,
Both banished me, and made this weak Lord Duke,
Will now forsake them all, besure he will:
I Will lie in ambush for conueniencie,
Upon their seuerance to confirm my self.

Cel. Is Ferneze interred?


Mal. Of that at leisure: he lives.


Cel. But how stands Mendoza, how is it with him?


Mal. Faith like a pair of Snuffers, s^ibbes filth in other men, and retains
it in himself.


Cel. He does fly from public notice me thinks, as a Hair does from hounds,
the feet whereon he flies betraies him.


Mal. I can track him Celzo:
O my disguise fools him most powerfully:
For that I seem a desperate malecontent
He feign would claspe with me: he is the true slave,
That will put on the most affected grace, Enter Mendoz.
For some vild second cause.

Cel. He Is here.


Mal. Give place.

Illo, ho ho ho, art there old true penny,

Exit Celso. Where have thou spent thy self this morning? I see flattery in
thine eyes, and damnation i'thy soul. Ha ye huge Rascal.


Men. Thou art very merry.


Mal. As a scholar futuens gratis: How doz the devil go with thee now.


Men. Maleuole, thou art an arrant knave.


Mal. Who I? I have been a Sergeant man.


Men. Thou art very poor.


Mal. As Job, an Alcumist, or a Poet.


Men. The Duke hates thee.


Mal. As Irishmen do bum-cracks.


Men. Thou have lost his amity.


Mal. As pleasing as Maids loose their virginity.


Men. Would thou were of a lusty spirit, would thou were noble.


Mal. Why sure my blood gives me I am noble, sure I am of noble kind, for I
find my self possessed with all their qualities: love Dogs, Dice and Drabs*
scorn wit in stuff clothes, have beat my Shoemaker, knocked my Sempstres,
cuckold my Pottecary, and undone my Tailor.

Noble, why not? since the Stoic said; Neminem ser^m non ex regibus, neminem
regem non ex seruis esse oriundum, only busy fortune towses, and the provident
chances blends them together; I Will give you a symilie: did you ere see a Well
with 2. buckets, whilst one comes up full to be emptied, another goes down
empty to be filled; such is the state of all humanity: why look you, I may
be the son of some Duke, for believe me intemperate lascivious bastardie
makes nobility doubtful, I have a lusty daring heart Mendoza.


Men. Lets graspe? I do like thee infinitely, wilt inact one thing for me?


Mal. Shall I get by it?

Gives him his purse. Command me, I am thy slave, beyond death and hell.


Men. Murder the Duke?


Mal. My hearts wish, my souls desire, my fantasies dream, My bloods longing,
the only haight of my hopes, how? O God how? O how my united spirits throng
together, So strengthen my resolve.


Men. The Duke is now a hunting.


Mal. Excellent, admirable, as the devil would have it, lend me, lend me,
Rapier Pistol, Crosebow: so, so, i will do it.


Men. Then we agree.


Mal. As Lent and Fishmongers, come a cape ape, how in form?


Men. Know that this weak braind duke, who only stands on Florence stilts,
has out of witless zeal made me his heir, and secretly confirmed the
wreathe to me after his life's full point.


Mal. Upon what merit?


Men. Merit? by heaven I horn him, only Fernezies death gave me states life:
tut we are politic, he must not live now.


Mal. No reason marry: but how must he dye now.


Men. My utmost project is to murder the Duke, that I might have his state,
because he makes me his heir: to banish the Duches, that I might be rid of a
cunning Lacedemonian, because I know Florence will forsake her, and then to
marie Maria the banished duke Altofronts wife, that her friends might
strengthen me and my faction, this is all law.


Mal. Do you love Maria.


Mend. Faith noe great affection, but as wise men do love great women to
in^oble their blood and augment their reuenew: to accomplish this now, thus
now. The Duke is in the forest next the Sea, single him* kill him, hurl him
in the maine, and proclaim thou sawst Woolues eat him.


Mal. Vm, not so good, me thinks when he is slain to get some Ipocrite, some
dangerous wretch that's muffled, or with feigned holiness to swear he hard the
Duke on some steep cliffe lament his wifes dishonor, and in an agony of his
hearts torture hurled his groaning sides into the swollen sea, this circumstance
well made, soundes probable, and hereupon the Duchess.


Men. May well be banished: o vnpeerable inuension, rare, Thou God of policy!
it hunnies me.


Mal. Then fear not for the wife of Altofront, i will close to her.


Men. Thou shall, thou shall, our excellency is pleased: why were not thou an
Emperor, when we are Duke i will make thee some great man sure?


Mal. Nay make me some rich knave, and I Will make my self some great man.


Mend. In thee be all my spirit, retain ten souls, unite thy vertuall powers,
resolve, ha, remember greatness, heart farewell.

Enter Celso. The fate of all my hopes in thee does dwell.


Mal. Celzo did hear? o heaven did hear?
Such devilish mischief, suffer thou the world
Carowse damnation even with greedy swallow,
And still do wink, still duz thy vengeance slumber,
If now thy brows are clear; when will they thunder.

Exit. SCENA QVARTA.
Enter Pietro, Ferrard, Prespasso and three Pages. Ferr. The Dogs are at a
fault.


Cornets like horns. Piet. Would God nothing but the dogs were at it? let the
Dear pursue safely, the Dogs follow the game, and do you follow the dogs, as
for me, it is unfit one beast should hunt another; I ha one chaseth me: and
please you I would be rid of ye a little.


Ferr. Would your grief would as soon as we, leave you to quietness.


Exeunt. Piet. I thank you: Boy; what do thou dream of now?


Page. Of a dry summer my Lord for here is a h^e world toward: but my Lord I
had a strange dream last ^ight.


Piet. What strange dream?


Page. Why me thought I pleased you with singing, and then I dreamt you gave me
that short sword.


Piet. Prettily begd: hold thee, i will prove thy dream true, take it.


Page. My duty: But stiil I dreamt on my Lord, and me thought and shall please
your excellency, you would needs out of your royal bounty give me that
jewel in your Hat.


Piet. O thou did but dream boy, do not believe it, dreams prove not
always true, they may hold in a short sword, but not in a Jewel. But now
sir you dream^ you had pleased me with singing, make that true as I ha made the
other.


Page. Faith my Lord I did but dream, and dreams you say prove not always
true: they may hold in a good sword, but not in a good song: the truth is, I
ha lost my voice.


Piet. Lost thy voice, how?


Page. With dreaming faith but here is a couple of Syrenicall rascal^ shall
inchaunt ye: What shall they singe my good Lord?


Piet* Sing of the nature of women, and then the song shall be su^ely full of
variety, old crochets and most sweet closes; it shall be humerous, grave,
fantastic, amorous, melancholy, sprightly, one in all, and all in one.


Pags. All in on?


Piet. Bir Lady too many sing, my speech grows culpable of unthrifty
idleness, sing.


The Song. SCENA QVINTA.
Enter Maleuole with Crosebowe and Pistol. A, so. so, sing, I am heavy, walk
of, I shall talk in my sleep walk of.

Exeunt Pages. Mal. Brief, brief, who? the Duke? good heaven that fools
should stumble upon greatness? do not sleep duke, give ye good morrow: must
be brief Duke. I am feed to murder thee, start not; Mendozo, Mendozo hired
me, h^r's his gold, his Pistol, Crosbowe, Sword, it is all as firm as earth: O
fool, fool, choakt with the common maze of easy Idiots, credulity make him
thine heir, what thy sworn murderer?


Pietro. O can it be?


Mal. Can?


Pietro. Discovered he not Ferneze?


Mal. Yes, but why? but why? for love to thee, much, much, to be revenged upon
his rival, who had thrust his jaws awrye, who being slain supposed by thine
own hands; defended by his sword, made thee most loathsome, him most gracious,
with thy loose Princes, thou closely yielding egresse and regresse to her,
made him heir, whose hot unquiet lust straight towzd thy sheets, and now
would seize thy state, politician, wise man, death to be led to the stake, like
a Bull by the horns to make even kindness cut a gentle throat, life, why art
thou numbed: Thou foggie dullness speak? lives not more faith in a home
thrusting tongue, then in these fencing tip tap Courtiers.


Enter Celso with a Hermits gown and beard. Cel. Lord Maleuole, if this be true


Mal. If? come shade thee with this disguise, if? thou shall handle it, he
shall thank thee for killing thy self, come follow my directions, and thou
shall see strange sleights.


Pietro. World whether will thou?


Mal. Why to the Devil: come, the morn grows late.
A steady quicknes is the soul of state.

Enter Maquarelle, knocking at the Ladies door. Maq. Medam, Medam, are you
stirring Medame, if you be stirring Medam, if I thought I should disturb ye.


Page. My Lady is up forsooth.


Maq. A, pretty boy, faith how old art thou?


Page. I think fourteen.


Maq. Nay, and ye be in the teens, are ye a gentleman borne, do you know me,
my name is Medam Maquerelle, I lie in the old Cunny Court.

Enter Beancha and Emilia. See here the Ladies.


Bean. A fair day to ye Maquerelle.


Emili. Is the Duchess up yet Centinell?


Maq. O Ladies, the most abominable mischance, O dear Ladies the most piteous
disaster, Farneze was taken last night in the Duchess Chamber: Alas the Duke
caught him and killed him.


Bean. Was he found in bed?


Maq. O no, but the villainous certenty is, the door was not bolted, the
tongue-tyed hatch held his peace, so the naked troth is, he was found in his
shirt, whilst I like an arrand beast lay in the outward Chamber, heard
nothing, and yet they came by me in the dark, and yet I felt the^ not, like a
senseless creature as I was. O beauties, look to your buske-poynts, if not
chastely, yet charily: be sure the door be boulted: is your Lord gone to
Florence?


Bean. Yes Maquarelle.


Maq. I hope you will find the discretion to purchase a fresh gown fore his
return: Now by my troth beauties, I would ha ye once wise: he loves ye, pish:
he is witty, bubble: fair proportioned, mew: nobly borne, wind; let this be
still your fixed position, esteem me every man according to his good gifts, and
so ye shall ever remain most dear, and most worthy to be most dear Ladies.


Emilia. Is the Duke returned from hunting yet?


Maq. They say, not yet.


Bean. It Is now in midst of day.


Em. How bears the Duchess with this blemish now?


Maq. Faith boldly, strongly defyes defame, as one that haz a Duke to her
father. And there is a note to you, be sure of a stout friend in a corner, that
may always awe your husband. Mark the hauiour of the Duchess now, she dares
defame, cries, Duke do what thou can, i will quite mine honor: nay, as one
confirmed in her own virtue against ten thousand mouths that mutter her
disgrace, she is presently for daunces.


Enter Ferrar. Bean. For daunces?


Maq. Most true.


Enusia. Most strange, see, heeres my servant young Ferrard: How many servants
think thou I have, Maquarelle?


Maq. The more the merier: it was well said, use your servants as you do your
smocks, have many, use one, and change often, for that is most sweet and
courtlike.


Ferrar. Save y^e fair Ladies, is the Duke returned?


Bean. Sweet Sir, no voice of him as yet in Court.


Fer. It Is very strange.


Bean. And how like you my servant, Maquarelle?


Maq. I think he could hardly draw Ulisses bow, but by my fidelity, were
his nose narrower, his eyes broader, his hands thinner, his lips thicker, his
legs bigger, his feet lesser, his hair blacker, and his teeth whiter, he
were a tolerable sweet youth in faith. And he will come to my Chamber, I will
read him the fortune of his beard.


Cornets sound. Fer. Not yet returned I fear, but
The Duchess approaches.

Enter Mendozo supporting the Duchess: Guerrino, the Ladies that are on the

Fer. So soon? it is wonder.


Guerrino Why it is but two singles on the left, two on the right, three double
forward, a trauerse of six round: do this twice, three singles side, galliard
trick of twenty, curranto pace; a figure of eight, three singles broken down,
come up, meet two doubles, fall back, and then honor.


Aurelia O Dedalus! thy maze, I have quite forgot it.


Maq. Trust me so have I, saving the falling back, and then honor.


Enter Prepasso. Aurelia Music, music.


Prepasso Who saw the duke? the duke.


Enter Equato. Aurel. Music.


Equato The duke, is the duke returned?


Aurelia Music:


Enter Celso. Celso The duke is either quite invisible, or else is not.


Aurelia We are not pleased with your intrusion upon our private retirement:
we are not pleased: you have forgot your selves.


Enter a Page. Celso Boy, thy Master, where is the Duke?


Page Alas, I left him burying the earth with his spread ioylesse limbs: he
told me he was heavy, would sleep, bade me walk off, for that the strength of
fantasy often made him talking in his dreams: I strait obeide, nor never saw
him since: but, where so ere he is, he is sad.


Aur. Music sound high, as is our heart, sound high.


SCENA TERTIA.
Enter Maleuole and Pietro disguised like an Hermit. Mal. The Duke, peace, the
Duke is dead.


Aurel. Music.


Mal. Is It Music?


Men. Give proof.


Fer. How?


Cel. Where.


Pre. When?


Mal. Rest in peace, as the Duke duz, quietly sit: for my own part, I beheld
him but dead, that's all: marry heers one can give you a more particular account
of him.


Men. Speak holy father, nor let any browe within this presence fright thee
from the truth: speak confidently and freely.


Aur. We attend.


Pietro Now had the mounting Suns all-ripening wings
Swept the cold sweat of night from earths danke breast,
When I (whom men call Hermit of the Rock)
Forsook my Ceil, and clamberd up a cliffe,
Against whose base, the heady Neptune dashed
His high curld brows, there it was I easde my limbs,
When lo, my entrails melted with the moan,
Some one, who far boue me was climbde, did make:
I shall offend.

Men. Not.


Aur. On.


Pietro. Me thinks I hear him yet, O female faith!
Coe sow the ungrateful sand, and love a woman:
And do I live to be the skoffe of men,
To be their wittall cuckold, even to hug my poison?
Thou know o Truth!
Sooner hard steel will melt with Southern wind;
A Seamans whistle calm the Ocean;
A town on fire be extinct with tears,
Then women vowed to blushlesse impudence,
With sweet behavior and soft minioning,
Will turn from that where appetite is fixed.
O powerful blood! how thou do slave their soul?
I washed an Ethiop, who for recompense
Sullyde my name. And must I then be for'cd.
To walk, to live thus black: must, must, fie,
He that can bear with must, he cannot die.
With that he sighed so passionately deep,
That the dull air even groand, at last he cries:
Sink shame in seas, sink deep enough, so dies.
For then I viewd his body fall and sowse
Into the fomy maine, O then I saw
That which me thinks I see, it was the Duke,
Whom straight the nicer stomackt sea
Belcht up: but then,

Mal. Then came I in, but las all was too late,
For even straight he sunk.

Pietro. Such was the Dukes sad fate.


Cel. A better fortune to our Duke Mendozo.

Cry all, Mendozo: Cornets flourish.


Enter a guard. Men. A guard, a guard, we full of hearty tears,
For our good fathers loss,
For so we well may call him:
Who did beseech your loves, for our succession,
Cannot so lightly ouer-iumpe his death.
As leave his woes reuenglesse: To Emilia,
woman of shame,
We banish thee for ever to the place,
From whence this good man comes,
Nor permit on death unto the body any ornament:
But base as was thy life, depart away.

Aur. Ungrateful.


Men. Away.


Aur. Villain hear me.


Prepasso and Guerino leads away the Duchess. Men. Be gone my Lords, address
to public counsel,
It Is most fit,
The train of Fortune is borne up by wit.
Away, our presence shall be sudden, haste.

All depart saving Mendozo, Maleuole, and Pietro. Mal. Now you egregious
devil, ha ye murdering politician, how do duke? how do look now? brave
duke in faith.


Men: How did you kill him?


Mal: Slatted his brains out, then sowst him in the brinie sea.


Men: Braind him and drowned him too?


Mal: O it was best, sure work:

For he that strikes a great man, let him strike home, or else ware, heel
prove no man: shoulder not a huge fellow, unless you may be sure to lay him
in the kennell.


Men: A most sound brain pan,
I Will make you both Emperors

Mal: Make us christians, make us christians.


Men: I Will hoist ye, ye shall mount.


Mal. To the gallows, say ye? O o me, Pra^ium incertum petit certum scelus. How
stands the Progress?


Men. Here, take my ring unto the Citadell,
Have entrance to Maria the grave Duchess
Of banished Altofront. Tell her we love her:
Omit no circumstance to grace our Person (do it)

Mal. Iste make an excellent pandar: Duke farewell, due adue Duke.


Exit Men. Take Maquerelle with thee; for it is found,
None cutts a Diamon but a Diamound.
Hermit, thou art a man for me, my Confessor,
O thou selected spirit, borne for my good,
Sure thou would make an excellent elder in a deformed church:
Come, we must be inward, thou and I all one.

Pietro I am glad I was ordained for ye.


Men. Go to then, thou must know that Malenole is a strange villain:
dangerous, very dangerous, you see how broad a speaks, a grose-jawde rogue,
I would have thee poison him: he is like a korne upon my great ^oe, I cannot go
for him: he must be kored out: he must, wilt do it, h^?


Pietro Anything, any thing.


Men. Heart of my life, thus then to the Citadell,
Thou shall consort with this Maleuole,
There being at supper, poison him,
It shall be laid upon Maria, who yeeldes love, or dies,
Skud quick.

Pietro Like lightning good deeds crawle, but mischief flies.


Enter Maleuole. Exit Pietro Mal. Your diuelships ring haze no virtue, the
buffecaptaine, the sallo-westfalian gamon-faced zaza cries stand out, must have
a stiffer wareant, or no pass into the castle of Comfort.


Men. Command our sudden Letter: not enter? sha^, what place is there in
Genoa, but thou shall into my heart, into my very heart: come, lets love, we
must love, we two, soul and body.


Mal. How did like the Hermit? A strange Hermit sirrah.


Men. A dangerous fellow, very perilous: he must die.


Mal. I, he must die.


Men. Thoust kill him: we are wise, we must be wise.


Mal. And provident.


Men. Yea provident; beware an hypocrite.

A Church man once corrupted, oh avoid*
A fellow that makes Religion his stawking horse,
He breeds a plague: thou shall poison him.

Mal. Ho, it is wondrous necessary: how?


Men. You both go jointly to the Citadell,
There sup, there poison him: and Maria,
Because she is our opposite, shall bear
The sad suspect, on which she dies, or loves us.

Mal: I run.


Exit mal: Men: We that are great, our sole self good still moves us:
They shall die both, for their deserts craves more
Than we can recompense, their presence still
Imbraides our fortunes with beholdingness,
Which we abhor, like deed, not door: then conclude,
They live not to cry out Ingratitude.
One stick burns the other, steel cuts steel alone:
It Is good trust few: but O, it is best trust none.

Exit Mendozo. SCENA QVARTA.
Enter Maleuole and Pietro still disguised, at several doors. Mal: How do
you? how do Duke?


Pietro O let the last day fall, drop, drop in our curssed heads!
Let heaven vnclasp itself, vomit forth flames:

Mal: O do not rave, do not turn Player, there is more of them, than can well
live one by an other already. What, art an Infidel still?


Pietro I am mazde, struck in a swowne with wonder, I am commanded to poison
thee.


Mal: I am commanded to poison thee, at supper.


Pietro At supper?


Mal: In the Citadell.


Pietro In the Citadell.


Mal: Cross capers, tricks? truth a heaven would discharge us as boys do
elder gunnes, one pellet to strike out another: of what faith art now?


Pietro Al is damnation, wickedness extreme, there is no faith in man.


Men. In none but usurers and brokers, they deceive no man, men take vm for
blood-suckers, and so they are: now God deliver me from my friends.


Pietro Thy friends?


Mal. Yes, from my friends, for from mine ennemies I Will deliver my self. O,
cut-thr^ate friendship is the ranckest villainy, mark this Mendozo, mark him
for a villain: but heaven will send a plague upon him for a rogue.


Pietro O world!


Mal. World? It Is the only region of Death, the greatest shop of the Devil,
the cruelst prison of men, out of the which none pass without paying their
dearest breath for a fee, there is nothing perfect in it, but extreme extreme
calamity, such as comes yonder.


SCENA QVINTA.
Enter Aurelia, two Holberts before, and two after, supported by Celso and
Ferrard, Aurelia in base mourning attire. Aur. To banishment, led on to
banishment*


Pietro Lady, the blessedness of repentance to you.


Au. Why, why, I can desire nothing but death, nor deserve any thing but hell.

If heaven should give sufficiency of grace
To dear my soul, it would make heaven graceless:
My sins would make the stock of mercy poor,
Oh they would try heavens goodness to ^eclaime them:
Judgment is just yet from that vast villain:
But sure he shall not miss sad punishment,
For he shall rule on to my Cell of shame.

Pietro My Cell it is Lady, where insteede of Maskes,
Music, Tilts, Tournies, and such Courtlike shows,
The hollow murmr of the checklesse winds
Shall groan again, whilst the unquiet sea
Shakes the whole rock with foamy battery:
There Vsherlesse the air comes in and out,
The reumy vault will force your eyes to weep,
Whilst you behold true desolation:
A rocky barrenness shall pain your eyes,
Where all at once one reaches, where he stands,
With brows the roof, both walls with both his hands.

Aur. It is to good, blessed spirit of my Lord:
O in what or befoere thy soul is throand,
Behold me worthily most miserable:
O let the anguish of my contrite spirit,
Entreat some reconciliation:
If not, O joy! triumph in my just grief,
Death is the end of woes, and tears relief.

Pietro Belike your Lord not loved you, was unkind.


Aur. O heaven,
As the soul loved the body, so loved he,
It Was death to him to part my presence,
Heaven to see me pleased:
Yet I like to a wretch given ore to hell,
Brake all the sacred rites of marriage,
To clippe a base ungentle faithles villain:
O God, a very Pagan reprobate!
What should I say, ungrateful throws me out,
For whom I lost soul, body, fame, and honor:
But it is most fit: why should a better fate
Attend on any, who forsake chaste sheets,
Fly the embrace of a devoted heart,
Joined by a solemn vow sore God and man,
To taste the brackish blood of beastly lust
In an adulterous touch? Oh ravenous immodesty,
Insatiate impudence of appetite:
Look, heere'^ your end, for mark what sap in dust,
What sin in good, even so much love in lust:
Joy to thy ghost, sweet Lord, pardon to me.

Cel. It is the Dukes pleasure this night you rest in court.


Aur. Soul lurk in shades, run shame from brightsome skies,
In night, the blind man misseth not his eyes.

exit Au: Mal. Do not weep kind cuckold, take comfort man, thy betters have
been Beccos: Agamemnon Emperor of all the merry Greeks; that tickled all the
true Troyans, was a Cornuto: Prince Arthur that cut off twelve Kings beardes
was a Cornuto: Hercules, whose back, bore up heaven, and got forty wenches
with child in one night.


Pietro Nay it was fifty.


Mal: Faith fortie's enough a conscience, yet was a Cornuto: patience, mischief
grows proud, be wise.


Piet: Thou pinchest too deep, art too keen upon me.


Mal: Tut, a pitiful surgeon makes a dangerous sore. I Will tent thee to the
ground. Think I Will sustain my self by ^ttering thee, because thou art a
Prince? I had rather follow a drunkard, and live by licking up his vomit, than
by servile flattery.


Piet: Yet great men ha don't.


Mal: Great slaves fear better than love, borne naturally for a coale-basket,
though the common ysher of princes presence fortune ha blindely given them
better place, I am vowed to be thy affliction.


Pietro Prithee be, I love much misery, and be thou son to me.


Enter Biliosa. Mal: Because you are an usurping Duke,
Your Lordship's well returned for Florence. 'To Biliosa.


Bil: Well returned, I praise my horse.


Mal: What news from the Florentines?


Bil: I will conceal the great Dukes pleasure, only this was his charge, his
pleasure is, that his daughter die, Duke Pietro be banished for banishing his
bloudes dishonor, and that Duke Altofront be reaccepted: this is all, but I
hear Duke Pietro is dead.


Mal. I, and Mendozo is Duke, what will you do?


Bil: Is Mendozo strongest?


Mal: Yet he is.


Bil: Then yet I Will hold with him.


Mal: But if that Altofront should turn strait again?


Biliosa. Why then I would turn strait again:
It Is good run still with him that haz most might:
I had rather stand with wrong, then fall with right*

Mal. Your Lordship sweats, your young Lady will get you a cloth for your old
worships brows, Exit Biliosa. heeres a fellow to be damnd, this is his
muiolable Maxim^. (flatter the greatest, and oppress the least:) a whoreson
flesh fly, that still gnawes upon the lean gauld backs.


Piet. Why dust then salute him?


Mal. Faith as ba^des go to Church, for fashion sake: come, be not confounded,
thou art but in danger to (...) a Dukedom, think this: this earth is the only
grave a^ ^olgotha wherein all things that live must rotte: it is but the draught
wherein the heavenly bodies discharge their corruption, the very muckhill on
which the sublunarie orbs cast their excrements: man is the slime of this
dongue-pit, and Princes are the governors of these men: for, for our souls,
they are as free as Emperoures, all of one piece, there goes but a pair of
sheeres betwixt an Emperor and the son of a bagpiper: only the dying,
dressing, pressing, glossing makes the difference: now what art thou like to
lose?

A iaylors office to keep men in bonds,
Whilst toil and treason, all life's good confounds.

Pietro. I here renounce for ever Regencie,
O Altofront, I wrong thee to supplant thy right:
To trip thy heels up with a devilish slight.
For which I now from Throane am thrown, world tricks abjure,
For vengance that comes s^ow, yet it comes sure.
O I am changed, for heerefore the dread power*
In true contrition I do dedicate,
My breath to solitary holiness,
My lips to prayer, and my breasts ^are shall be,
Restoring Altofront to regency.

Mal. Thy vows are heard, and we accept thy faith.

Enter Ferneze ^d Celso vndisg^iseth himself. Altofront, Ferneze, Celso,
Pietr^.

Banish amazement: come, we four must stand full shocke of Fortune, be not so
w^nder st^.


Pietro Does Ferneze live?


(...). For your pardon.


P^tro Pardon and love, give leave to recollect
My thoughts dispersed in wild astonishment:
My vows stand fixed in heaven, and from hence
I crave all love and pardon.

Mal. Who doubts of providence,
T^ (...) this change, a hearty faith to all:
H^ (...) ^ust rise, who can no lower fall,
(...) petuous Vicissitude
Loses the world, then let no maze intrude
Upon your spirits: wonder not I rise,
For who can sink that close can temporise?
The time grows ripe for action, I Will detect
My priuatst plot, ^est ignorance fear suspect:
Lets cloase to counsel, leave the rest to fate,
Mature discretion is the life of state.

Exeunt. Actus quartus
Scena prima.
Enter Maleuole and Maquarelle, at several doors opposite, singing. Mal. The
Dutchman for a drunkard,


Maq. The Dane for golden locks:


Mal. The Irishman for vsquebath,


Maq The Frenchman for the ()


Mal. O thou art a blessed creature, had I a modest woman to conceal, I would
put her to thy custody, for no reasonable creature would ever suspect her to
be in thy company: ha, thou art a melodious Maquarelle, thou picture of a woman
and substance of a beast, and how do thou think a this transformation of
state now?


Maq. Very very well, for we women always note, the falling of the one, is
the rising of the other: some must be fat, some must be lean, some must be
fools, and some must be Lords: some must be knaves, and some must be
officers, some must be beggars, some must be Kni^* some must be cuck olds, and
some must be citizens: as for example, I have two court dogs, most fawning
curres* ^he one calde Watch, the other Ca^h: now I, like Lady Fortune, sometimes
love this dog* sometimes rouse that dog, sometimes favor Watch, most commonly
fancy Catch: Now that dog which I favor I feed* and h^es so ravenous, that
what I give he never chawes it, gulpes it dow^ (...) without any relish of what
he haz, but with a (...) ^pectation of what he shall have: the other dog* (...)


Mal. No more dog, soote Maquarelle no more dog^ and what hope have thou of
the Duchess Maria, will she stoop to the Dukes luer, will she come, think?


Maq. Let me see where is ^he sign now? ha ye e^e a callender, where is the sign
tro^ you?


Mal. Sign? why, is there any moment in that?


Maq. O believe me a most secret power, look ye a Caldean, or an Assyrian, I
am sure it was a most sweet Jew ^ould me, court any woman in the right sign,
you shall not miss, but you must take he^ in the right vein then: As when the
sign is in Pisces, a fishmo^gers wife is very sotiable: in Cancer, a
pr^cisians wife is very flexible: in Capricorn, a Merchants wife hardly
holds out: in Libra, a Lawyers wife is very tractable, especially, if her
husband be at the term: only, in Scorpio ^s ve^ie dangerous meddling, haz the
Duke sent any jewel, any rich stones?


Enter Captain. Mal. I, I think those are the best signs, to take a Lady in:
by your favor signeur: I must discourse with the Lady Maria, Altofronts
Duchess: I must enter for the Duke.


Cap. She here shall guie you enterveiw, I received the guardshippe of this
Ci^adell from the good Al^front, and for his use I Will keep't, til I am of ^o use.


Mal. Will thou, O heaven that a christian should be found in a buffeierkin,
Captain conscience? I love thee Capt^e. Exit Captain. we attend, and what
hope have thou of this Duchess (...)?


Maq. Twill go hard, she was a could creature ever, she hated munkies, fools,
ieasters, and gentlemen vshers extremely: she had the vilde trick on it, not
only to be truly modestly honorable in her own conscienc^ (...) she would
avoid the least wanton carria^ (...) might incur suspect, as God bless me,
she (...) (...) brought bed pressing out of fashion: I could ^arce get a fine,
for the lease of a Ladies favor once in a fortnight.


Mal. Now in the name of immodesty, how many maiden-heads have thou brought to
the block?


Maq. Let me see: heaven forgive us our misdeedes, heeres the Duchess.


SCENA SECVNDA.
Enter Meria and Captain. Mal. God bless thee Lady,


Mar. out of thy company:


Mal. We have brought thee tender of a husband,


Mar: I hope I have one already.


M^q. Nay, by mine honor madam, as good he nere a husband, as a banished
husband, he is in an other world now, I Will tell y^ Lady, I have heard of a sect
that maintained, when the husband was asleep, the wife might lawfully
entertain another man: for then her husband was as dead, much more when he is
banished.


Mar. Dishonest creature:


Maq. Pish, honesty is but an art to seem so: pray ye what is honesty? what is
constancy? but fables fained, odd old fools chat deuisde by ielous fools, to
wrong our liberty.


Mal. Mully, he that loves thee is a Duke, Mendozo, he will maintain thee
royally, love the ardently, defend thee powerfully, marry thee sumptuously,
and keep thee in despite of Rosciclere, or Donzell dell Phebe^ there is ^wels,
if thou will, so, if not, so.


Mar: Captain, for Gods love save poor wretchedness,
From tyranny of lustful insolence:
Enforce me in the deepest dungeon dwell
Rather then here, here round about is hell.
O my dear'st Altofront where ere thou breath,
Let my soul sink into the shades beneath:
Before I stain thine honor, it is thou have,
And long as I can die* I will live chaste.

Mal. Against him that can enforce how vain is strife?


Mar. She that can be enforced haz nere a knife.
She that through force her limbs with lust enroules,
Wants Cleopatraes aspes and Portiaes coals.
God amend you.

Exit with Captain. Mal: Now the fear of the Devil for ever go with thee.
Maquerelle, I tell thee I have found an honest woman, faith I perceive when all
is done, there is of women as of all other things: some good, most bad, some
saints, some sinners: for as now adays no Courtier but haz his mistress, no
Captain but haz his cockatrice, no Cuckold but haz his horns, and no fool
but haz his f^ther: even so no woman but haz her weakness and feather too, no
sex but haz his: I can hunt the letter no further: O God how loathsome this
toying is to me, that a Duke should be for^d to fool it: well, Stultoru^plena
sunt omnia, better play the fool Lord, then be the fool Lord: now, where is
your slightes Madam Maquarelle?


Maq. Why, are ye ignorant that it is sed, a squemish affected nicenes is
natural to women, and that the excuse of their yielding, is only forsooth the
difficult obtaining, you must put her too'^, women are flax, and will fire in
a moment.


Mal. Why was the flax put into thy mouth, and yet thou? thou set fire? thou
inflame her.


Maq. Mary, but I Will tell ye now, you were too ho^*


Mal. The fitter to have (...) the flaxwoman.


Maq. You were too boisterous (...)* for indeed.


M^. (...), thou art a weak pandres, now I se^.
^ner earthes fire heaven it self shall waste,
Then all with he^ c^n mel^ a mind that is chaste.
Go thou the Dukes lime-twigge, I Will make the Duke turn thee out of thine
office, what not get one touch of hope, and (...) at such advantage.

Men. Sent man? what returns Maria? what answer to our suit?


Mal. Cold* frostie, she is obstinate.

Cells: I shall observe y^e.


Men. And Celso, (...) let it be thy care to night
To have some pretty show* ^o solemnize
Our high instalment, some music, maskery:
We Will give f^re ent^taine unto Maria
The Duchess to the banishd Altofront:
Thou shall conduct her from the Citadell
Unto the Palace, think on some maskery.

Cel: Of what shape, sweet Lord,


Men. Why shape? why any quick done fiction,
As some brau^ spirits of the Gen^ Dukes,
To come out of Elysium forsooth,
Led in by Mercury to gratulate
Our happy fortune, some such any thing, some far ^et trick, good for
Ladies, some stale toy or other, no matter so't be of our devising.

Do thou prepar't, it is but for fashion sake,
Fear not, it shall be graced man, it shall take.

Cel: All service.


Men: All thanks, our hand shall not be ^lose to thee: farewell
Now is my treachery secure, nor can we fall:
Mischief that pr^spers men do virtue call,
I Will trust no man, he that by trickes*go^s wreathes,
Keeps them with ^le, no man se^ely breathes,
Out of (...) ranks the Crowde will m^tter fool:
Who cannot bear with spi^e he cannot rule:
The chi^st (...) for a man of flat^,

Exit Mendozo. Mal. Death of the damned thief, I Will make one in the mask, thou

For n^ disastrous chance can ever m^e him,
That leaves nothing but a God above him.

Exeunt. Enter Prepasso and Bilioso, two Pages, before them Maquar: Beanche,
and Emilia. Bil: Make room there, room for the ladies: why gentlemen, will not
ye suffer the ladies to be entr^d in the great chamber? why gallants? and you
sir, to drop your Torch where the beauties must sit too.


Pre. And there is a great fellow plays the knave, why do not strike him?


Bil: Let him play the knave a Gods name, think thou I have no more wit then
to strike a great fellow, the music, more lights, reueling, scaffolds: do you
hear? let there be oaths enough ready at the door, swear out the devil
himself. Lets leave the Ladies, and go see if the Lords be ready for them.


All save the Ladie^ depart. Maq. And by my troth Beauties, why do you not put
you into the fashion, this is a stale cu^* you must come in fashion: look ye,
you must be all felt, fealt and feather, a fealt upon your head: look ye,
these ^ing things are justly out of request now: and do ye hear? you must
wear falling bands, you must come into the falling fashion: there is such a
deal a pinning these ruffes, when the sine clean fall is worth all: and
again* if you should chance to take a nap in the afternoon, your falling ba^
requires no poting stick to recover his form: beheue (...), no fashion to the
falling band I say.


Bean. And is not (...) S. Andrew Iaqu^ ^ gallant fellow now?


Maq. By my maidenhead la, honor and he agrees as well together, as a satin
suit and woollen stockings.


Emil. But, is not Marshall Make-roome my servant in reversion, a proper
gentleman?


Maq. Yes in (...) as he had his office, as in truth he has all things in
reversion: he haz his Mistress in reversion, his clothes in reversion, his wit
in reversion, and indeed^, is a suter to me for my dog in reversion: but in
good verity la, he is as proper a gentleman in reversion as: and indeed, as
fine a man as may be, having a red beard and a pair of warpt legs,


Bean. But I faith I am most monstrously in love with count Quidlibet in
Quodlibet, is he not a pretty dapper windle gallant?


Maq. He is even one of the most busy ^ingerd lords, he will put the beauties
to the squeake most hiddeously.


Bil. Room, make a lane there, the Duke is entering: stand handsomely for
beauties sake, take up the Ladies there. So, cornets, cornets.


SCENA QVARTA.
Enter Prepasso ioynes to Bilioso* two pages with lights, Ferrard, Mendozo, at
the other door two pages with lights, and the Captain leading in Maria, the
Duke meets Maria, a^ closes with her, the rest fall back. Men. Madam, with
gentle ear receive my suite,
A kingdoms safety should over pa^ze slight rites,
Marriage is merely Natures policy:
Then since unless our royal beds be joined,
Danger and civil tumul^ frights the sta^e,
Be wise as you are fair, give way to fa^.

Mar: What would thou, thou affliction to our house? Thou ever devil, it was
the that banishedst my truly noble Lord.


Men* I?


Mar: I, by the plo^e ^hy ^hy blac^ ^agems,
Twelve Moons have suffered change since I be held
The lou^d presence of my de^st Lord.
O thou fair worse than death, he parts but soul
From a weak body, but thou soul from soul
Disseuerst, that which Gods own hand did kni^.
Thou scant of honor, full of di^elish wi^.

Men: We Will check your too intemperate Iauishnes, I I can, and will.


Mar: What can?


Men: Go to, in banishment thy husband dies.


Mar: He ever is at home that's ever wise.


Men. Youst never meet more ^eason should Love control,


Mar. Not meet?

She that de^re loves, her love's still in her soul.


Men. You are but a woman Lady, you must yield.


Mar: O save me thou innated bashfulnes,
Thou only ornament of woman's modesty.

Men: Modesty? Death I Will torment thee,


Mar: Do, urge all torments, all afflictions try,
I Will die, my Lords, as long as I can die.

Men: Thou obstinate, thou shall die: captain, that Ladies life is forfeited
to Justice, we have examined her,

And we do find, she has impoisoned
The re^erend Hermit, therefore we command
Se^rest custody. Nay, if you will dooes no good,
Youst dooes no harm, a tyrants peace is blood.

Mar* O thou art merciful, O gracious devil,
Rather by much let me condemned be,
For seeming murder than be ^amn'd for thee.
I Will mourn no more, come girt my brows with flowers,
Revel and dance, soul, now thy wish thou have,
Die like a Bride, poor heart thou shall die chaste. Enter Aurelia in mo^rning
habit.
Life is a frost of could felicity,

Aur. And death the thaw of all our vanity.
Wast not an honest Priest that wrote so?

Men. Who? let her in.

From glomie shades that spread the lower coasts,
Calls four high famed Genoa Dukes to come,
And make this presence their (...):
To pass away this high triumphall night,
With song and daunces, courts more soft delight.

Aur. Are you God of ghostes, I have a suit depending in hell betwixt me and my
conscience, I would ^aine have thee help me to an advocate.


Bil. Mercury shall be your lawier Lady,


Aur. Nay faith, Mercury haz too good a face to be a right lawier.


Pre. Peace, forbear: Mercury presents the ma^ke.


Cornets: The song to the Cornets, which playing the mask enters. Enter
Maleuole, Pietro, Ferneze, and Celso in white robes, with Dukes Crowns upon

Celso, court Maria for our love Lady, be gracious, yet grace.


Mar. With me Sir?


Mal. Yes more loved then my breath: ^aleuole taks ^s wife to ^unce.

With you I Will dance.

Mar. Why then you dance with death,
But come Sir, I was nere more apt for mirth.
Death gives eternity a glorious breath^
O, to die honored, who would fear to die.

Mal: They die in fear who live in villainy.


Men. Yes, believe him Lady, and be ruled by him.

Bean. I had rather you would swear by your body: I think that would prove the
more regarded oath with you.


Fer. I Will swear by them both, to please you.


Bea. O* dam them not both, to please me, for Gods sake.


Eer. Faith sweet creature let me enjoy you to night, and I Will marry you to
morrow fortnight, by my troth lo.


Maq. On his ^roth lo, believe him not, that kind of cunnicatching is as stale
as fir Oliver Anchoues perfumde ierkin: promise of matrimony by a young
Gallant, to bring a virgin Lady into a fools paradise: make her a great woman,
and then cast her off: it is as common as natural to a Courtier, as jelosie to a
Citizen, gluttony to a Puritan, wisdom to an Alderman, pride to a Tailor, or
an empty to one of these sixepenny damnations: of his troth lo, believe him
not, traps to catch polecats.


Mal. Keep your face constant, let no sudden passion speak in your eyes. To
Maria.



Mar. O my Altofront.


Pietro A tyrants jelosies are very nimble, you receive it all. To Aurelia.

Men. O lend me breath to live til I am fit to die.
For peace with heaven, for your own souls sake
Vouchsafe me life.

Pietro. Ignoble villain, whom neither h^en nor hell, goodness of God or man
could once make good.


Mal. Base trecherour wretch, what grace ^anst thou expect,
That have grown impudent in gracelesnesse.

Men. O life!


Mal. Slave, take thy life.
Were thou defenced through blood and wounds,
The sternest horror of a civil fight,
Would I atcheeue thee, but prostrat at my feet,
