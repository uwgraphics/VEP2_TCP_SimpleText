An introduction for to learn to reckon with the pen, or with the counters
according to the true cast of Algorisme, in hole numbers or in broken, newly
corrected. And certain notable and goodly rules of false positions thereunto
added, not before seen in our English tongue, by the which all manner of
difficile questions may easily be dissolved and assoyled. Anno. 1546.

To the reader.
THat art and feate (dear reader, whom vtilite and necessite both do
commend, neadeth greatly of no other commendation. How profitable and
necessary this feat of Algorisme is, to all manner of persons, which have
rekenynges or accountes, other to make, or else to receive, needs no
declaration. Neither is this art only necessary to those, but also in manner
to all manner of sciences, and artificyes. For what craft is that but it
sometime does occupye not only one part of this feate, but all the parts.
And forbycause that diverse rueles in this book have not ben in times paste,
very co^modiously expressed, and set forth, and many examples, mo then nedid a
great sort coheaped together. Therefore pains have been taken both in the
better and more clearer declaration and expressing of the said rules: and also
in the resectynge and cuttynge of diverse superfluouse and void things, rather
hynderance to the dyligent reader, than fortherance. Forthermore there is added
the rules of false posytions, the which how convenient and profitable they be
to the ready solution of all hard and mysty questyons: when ye have read
them then judge. Now then ye shall understand that in this art there
are.vii. necessary and distinct parts to be known. Numeration, Addicion,
Subtractio^, Multiplycation, Partition, Progrestion, and Reduction. Of the
which.vii. hereafter shall be syngularly entracted of each of them in their
chapters. But I aduertyse you first to begin at the first part, and then
successyuely to the second, and third. etc. learning every part by it self
exactely, as they be set forth in this book: for if you lepe to the second
part, before you have perfectly the first, or to the third, before you have
seen the second, you shall never prosper ne profette in this art. Vale.

Finis.
The first part is of Numeration.
NVmeration is a manner of expressing of numbers by certain figures which are
called figurs of Algorisme, the which be ten, as in this example.

i. ii. iii. iiii. v. vi. vii. viii. ix. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0

Of the which nine be significatyue, the tenth called a siphre, sygnifieng
nothing of it self, but only set before the other significatyue fygurs
augmentyth their signification. In numeration by this craft ye must evermore
begin at the right side of the book, and so toward the lift side, as in
this example.

k i h g f e d c b a 3 2 0 4 6 7 5 2 8 9

This figure 9 under a, stands in the first place. 8 under b, stands in
the second place, and so forth to the end, so that 3 under k, stands in
the last place. By these ten figures all manner of number possible to be
excogitate, may clearly and plainly be expressed: which all be it, that of
them self they sygnifie but simple and little number, as ye se before, yet
according to the diversity of the place they stand in, dyuersly does their
signification amount. Wherefore in numeratio^ ye must note two things, the
figure significatiue, and the place it stands in for the signification of the
figure depends upon the number of the place it stands in: For example, this
figure 8 standing alone, or in the first place signifies but.viii. but if he
stand in the second place, as here 80 he signifies.viii. times ten, which
is called.iiii. score. if he stand in the third place, as here 800 he
signifies.viii. hundredth. etc. Therefore ye must know perfectely the
signifycatio^ of every place, before ye can perfectely number. wherefore
understand ye, that the first place is a place of vnitees, so that a figur
standing in it, signifies no more then though he stand alone. The second
place is a place of tennes. The third is a place of hu^drydes. The fourth place
is a place of thousands. The fifth place, a place of ten thousands. The.vi.
place a place of hundredth thousands. The.vii. place, is of thousand
thousands, which is called a myllion. The.viii. place, is of ten myllions.
The.ix. is a place of hundredth myllyons. The.x. of thousand myllions. The.xi.
of ten thousand myllions. The xii. of a hundredth thousand myllions. The.xiii.
of a thousand thousand myllio^, which is called myllyon upon myllyon. And so
forth infinitely, every place ensuenge, signifies.x. times as much as the
place going before. This must thou know perfitely what every place gives
and signifies: for the place gives denomination, and the figure standing in
the same place expresses how many of the same denomination is to be
understand: as in example ye shall more plainly perceive

In this sum 3400872619 this figure ^ standyth in the.iiii. place, now by
your rule before, the.iiii. place is a place of thousands, then this figure 2
standing in the same place gives us to wit, that it is two thousand,
Likewise this figure 8 stands in the.vi. place, now by your rule before
spoken of, the.vi. place is of hunderth thousands: then this figure 8 situat
in the same place receives denominatio^ of the place, and represents to us
viii. hundredth thousands. Like wise this figure 1 stands in the second place
and forbycause the second place is a place of tennes, therefore this figure 1
standing there is bound to the signification of the place, and so signifies
one ten: if a figure of 4 stood there, it should signify.iiii. tennes, that is
forty, and so forth. Then for a farther declaracyon of the foresaid sum,
and all other like sums. This figure 9 standing in the first place,
signifies but him self, that is.ix. This figure 1 standing in the second
place, by cause the second place is ever a place of tennes, sygnyfyeth one
ten. The figure 6, standing in the third place, because the third place is
a place of hundrethe, does signifye.vi. hundredth: the figure 2 in the fourth
place, signifies.ii. thousand: the figure 7 forbycause it standethe in the
fyfte place, and that place is a place of ten thousands, it signifies vii.
times ten thousand, the which is iii. score thousand and ten: the figure 8
in the.vi. place fignifieth.viii. hundredth thousand: the sypher 0 that stands
in ye vii. place signifies nothing, but only makes up a place that the
fygures significatyue following may increase there signification. Like
judgment is of the sypher standing in the.viii. place: in the ix. place
stands the figure of 4, and this place is a place of hundredth myllyons:
therefore this figure 4 there signify the iiii, C. myllions. In the.x. place
stands the figure 3, and this place is a place of thousand myllions:
therefore it signifies.iii. thousand myllions. So the hole sum is, three
thousand mylions.iiii.C. millio^s.viii.C. thousand, three score thousands.xii.
thousand.vi. hundredth, and.xix. Now to exercise your self in numeratio^ number
with your self these sums following, and you shall be perfect enough.
Millio^. Mil. Mil. Mil.

x. M. C. x. M. C. x. one 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4
4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 9
9 9 9 9 9 Furthermore thou must note that there be in algorisme three manner of
numbres, Diget number, Article, and Composte.

The digette number, is all manner of numbres, which are under.x. as these.

9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

The article number is, all numbers which are of.x. as these.

10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90

The compounde number is all manner of numbres which are compou^d or made of the
dyget and article together, as follow. 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 21 22 23 24 25
26 27 28 29 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 And so forth of al other. This is
sufficient for the knowledge of nu^bre in Algorisme.

The second part called Addition.
ADdition is a collectio^ of diverse and sundry su^mes, into one total sum,
which contaynyth as much in him as all the other su^mes, being before sundry.
In addition are two nombres to be consyderyd, the one is, the nu^bres which
must be adjoined together: the other is the numbers which redoundeth of their
addition together, which otherwise is called the total sum. Then when ye
will add many sums together, first write them fair the one dyrectely under
the other, so that the first figure of the one, be right under the first of the
other, and the second under the second: every place correspondent under
other: that done draw a line under al these several sums, as is to se in ye
example following. And when ye will add your numbers together, begin at the
first places of your su^mes and add all the figures that ye se in the first
places of all your su^mes together, and yt that comes of that addition, se
whether it be digette number, article, or co^post: if it be but dyget, set ye
dyget benethe the line, directely under the same first places: if it be article
put a cipher beneth the line, right under the same first place, and reserve ye
article to be added to the next places of thy su^mes and there do likewise, if
it be co^post, set the dyget under the line right under ye same place, and
reserve the article in your mind likewise to be added to the next places of
thy su^mes: when the figures standing in the last places of your sums be
adjoined together, if any article or articles remain, set them down next to
the figure ye set last before under the same line: as by examples shall
appear.

The first sum. 6 7 8 9 4 The second sum 3 4 5 6 7 The third sum 2 3 4
5 6 The fourth sum 7 8 9 3 4 The fyfth sum 6 7 4 2 5 The syxthe sum 3 4 3
2 2 Summa totalis 3 0 6 5 9 8

Your fygures set after this sort, add all the fygures that ye find in the
first places of all the sums together, beginning at the nethermost saying,
2 and 5 is 7, and 4 that is 11, and 6 that is 17, and 7 that is 24, ans 4 that
ts 28. This is the hole sum of the figurs added together found in the first
places, the which number is composte: wherefore, as is in your rule, ye must
set the dyget right under the same place, benethe the line, the which is 8,
and keep the articles in your mind, which is 2. Now to the second place,
toward the lift hand, say, 2 that I have in mind and 2 is 4, and 2 makes
6, and 3 is 9, and 5 is 14, and 6 is 20, and 9 is 29, now set the 9 under 2,
and keep 2 in mind, and add them to the first figure of the third place,
that is 3. Now say 2 and 3 is 5, and 4 is 9, and 9 is 18, and 4 is 22, and 5 is
27, and 8 is 35. Now set 5 under 3, and keep ^ in mind. Now to the fourth
place, toward the lift hand where 4 stands, now 3 that ye have in mind
and 4 is 7, and 7 is 14, and 8 is 22, and 3 is 25, and 4 is 29, and 7 is 36,
set 6 under 4, and keep 3, and add that 3 to the undermost figure of the syxt
sum that is 3, and say 3 and 3 is 6, and 6 is 12, and 7 is 19, and 2 is 21,
and 3 is 24, and 6 is 30. All the figures of this place added together as ye
se, makes article number wherefore according to your rule set a cyfer 0 under
that place benethe the line, and the article which is 3 next to the same
cyfer, and al is finished. And all these su^mes thus collected together makes
306598.

An other example of addition.

1 0 0 6 6 7 8 4 5 6 0 0 0 3 1 9 5 0 5 0 0 5 4 5 1 6 1 8 0 1 2 0 2 6 4 2 1 2 2
0 2 0 5 2 5 7 9

Begin first as ye did before, at the first places, addyng them all together,
beginning at the nethermost, saying, 1 and 2 is 3, and 1 is 4, and 5 is 9,
this is the hole sum of the fygures standing in the first place, the which
is diget number, and therefore according to the rule, set it right under the
same place benethe the line: then proceed to the second place and begin at the
nether end saying, 2 and 6 is 8, and 5 is 13, and 4 is 17, these number is
compost number, therefore set ye diget right under that place beneth the line,
which is 7, reserving the article in your mind, and so to the third place,
saying, 1 that I have in my mind and 4 that is 5, and 2 is 7, and 1 is 8, and
9 is 17, and 8 is ^5, this number also is co^post, wherfo^e set the diget 5
under that third place, and reserve the article 2 in mind to the next place,
then to ye next places saying, 2 yt I have in mind and 6 is 8, and 1 is 9, and
5 is 14, and 1 is 15, and 7 is 22, this is also co^post, therefore set ye diget
2 under that.iiii. place, and reserve the article 2 to ye next places, then to
the fifth place saying 2 that I have in mind and 4 is 6, and 3 is 9, and ^ is
15, this is also compost number, set the diget 5 under ye fyfth place, and keep
ye article in mind, to the.vi. place saying, 1 ye I have in mind and 8 is 9
and 5 is 14, and 6 is 20 this is article number, therefore according to the
rule set a syfer under the place benethe the line, and keep the article in
mind and cum to the.vii. place, in ye which places for because thou fyndest
nothing but ciphers to the whith you myghtes adioyne thy article reserved, the
which was 2, therefore under ye same.vii. place set that same reserved 2, and
then com to the.viii. place and there fyndest you nothing but ciphers wherefore
under the same place set beneth the line a cipher, according to the rule, then
c^^^e to the.ix. places and say 5 and 6 is 11, and 1 is 12, the which is
co^post number, therefore set ye diget which is 2 under the line and reserve ye
article in mind, which is 1, now for because there is no mo places whereunto ye
might add this reserved article therefore according to your rule ye shall set it
down next unto the figure that ye did set under the line last, as is in your
example. This.ii. examples were sufficient enough to the redynesse of addition,
how be it yet that it may be the playner I will subscribe an other example.

1 4 6 9 9 0 0 0 3 8 2 9 0 2 0 0 0 1 0 9 1 6 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 5 5 1 0 0 8 0 0

Add the first place together. First there thou fyndest nothing but cyfers,
wherefore set a cyfer under the line, and so likewise in the second place. In
the third place thou fyndest 6 and ^ which makes 8, the which for because
it is dygette number, set it under that place benethe the line. In the.iiii.
place is 1 and 9 which makes 10, and forbycause that this is article number,
set a cyfer under that place benethe the line, and reserve the article to the
next place saying, 1 that I have in my mind and 2 is 3, and 9 is 12, and 9 is
21, and 9 is 30 this is also article number, wherefore set a cyfer under that
place beneth the line, and reserve the article 3 in mind to the next place.
Then come to the.vi. place: saying, 3 that I have in my mind and 2 is 5, and
6 is 11, this is composte number therefore I set the dyget which is 1 right
under that place beneathe the line, and reserve the article 1 to the ne^te
place, saying 1 and 1 is 2, and 1 is 3, and 8 is 11, and 4 is 15, this is also
composte, therefore set the dyget 5 under the line, and add the article
reserved to the figure in the ne^te place saying, 1 and 3 is 4, and 1 is 5,
this is dyget number, therefore set it under the line, and all is done.

Of the prove of Addition.
For the prove of addition, ye shall make a cross after the fashyon that
follows. And then ye shall come first to the addible sums, and pluck out
all the 9 that ye find there, and the rest what so ever it be, yt will not
make 9 set it at the upper side of the cross. Then come to the total sum
under the line, and likewise deduck all the 9 that ye can find there and that
that remains, not able to make 9 set it ^t the undermost part of the cross,
and if it be like the remenant of the addyble numbres which standith in the
upper part of the cross, your work was good, if not it was naught, as by
example ye shall the better perceive.

An example of the prove.
A 1 5 0 6 7 0 B 3 3 0 4 2 8 C 5 8 1 0 9 8

Now for to make the prove of this numbres, ye shall begin at the first
figure that ye have made, in saying, 8 and 0 is 8 and 2 is 10, take away 9
then there rests 1, than 1 and 7 is 8, and 4 is 12, take away 9 rest 3,
than 3 and 6 is 9, than to the two ciphers of nothing that nothing do
sygnifie, thanne 3 and 5 is 8 and 3 is 11, take away 9 rest 2, thanne 2 and 2
is 4, this 4 it behooves you to put at the nether end of the cross, than come
to the place of C. under the line and say 8, ye shall leave the 9 and the cipher
0 that is nothing worth, and adioyne 1 thereto and make it 9, and leave that,
thanne 8 and 5 is 13, take away 9 rest 4, which 4 ye shall put at ye upper
end of the cross and than is your prove g od, for both the ends be like as
ye se in this figure of ye cross ^. And at the two other ends ye shall put
two 0 0 in certifyeng that of them comes nothing.

An other example.
A 7 8 9 1 5 4 3 2 6 li. B 4 9 3 0 0 6 7 1 5 li. C 2 0 9 9 3 4 7 8 4 li. D 4 6
0 6 4 5 5 3 0 li. E 9 3 6 4 5 8 7 7 8 li. F 4 4 5 1 9 3 0 0 1 li. G 3 3 3 4 3 9
3 1 3 4 li.

We shall say semblably 1 and 8 is 9 and always leave them, than 0 that does
nothing, than 4 and 5 ben 9, than 6, then we shall return to the tenthes,
and shall find 0 that does nothing, than 7 that mak^th 9 test 4, than 3 ben
7, than 8 ben 9 rest 6, then 1 is 7, then 2 is 9, then 0 that is nothing
worth, then 7 and 5 is 9 rest ^ then 7 is 9 rest 1, then 7 is 8 and 3 is 9
rest 1. Thanne we come to the place of hundrethes, and adioyne the 2 to the 3
that is 5 than 8 is 9 rest 4, and so consequently unto the end. And if
peradventure we find this figure 9 because of the brefnes, we shall leave it.
And shall find at the end 9, therefore we shall put at the end of the cross
0 in sygnifienge that there is nothing above 9. And so shall we do in the
number of G. and we shall find like 9 for the which semblably we shall put 0.
And so is the addition good and well made.

The prove ^

As touching of addition in broken numbers, ye shall find that under the
title of Reduction hereafter.

Of Subtraction, the third part.
SVbtractio^ is a manner of debatyng or subducyng a less sum out of a
greater: or like of like showing what remains.

In subtraction are two numbers, the first is the number abatyd, the second,
the number abatynge.

Then when ye will subtrahe any one number out of an other. First ye shall
write the number to be abatyd, and under it directely figure under figure, and
place under place writ the abatoure, and benethe these two sums draw a
line, then begin your subtraction at the first places, and subduce the figure
standing in the first place of the abatour of the first figure standing in
the first place of the number to be abatyd: and the rest that remains after
the abatement set it right under the same place benethe the line: and so do
like wise in the second the third, and al other places. And when ye have all
done, the number that shall remain under the line, shall be that, that
remains after the subduction of the abatour of the number abatyd. As for
example.

Lent 8 3 4 5 6 Paid 4 1 1 3 1 Rest 4 2 3 2 5

I lent a man 83456 li. of the which he has paid me 41111 li. again now I
desire to know how much remains. Then according to the rule, first I set
the lent money, and right under that I set the repayed money, figure under
figure, and place under place: as ye se by the example Under both these sommes
I must draw a line. Begin to subtrahe the under sum out of the upper, saying,
1 out of 6 remains 5, this 5 that remains according to the rule set under
the same place beneth the line: then to the second place pluck 3 out of 5
remains 2, set that under the line: then to ye third place, pluck 1 out of 4
remains 3, set that under the line: then to the fourth place, take 1 out of
3 remains 2, set it under the line: then in the fyfth place, take 4 out of
8 remains 4, set that also under the line, and so thou have fynyshed: Then
thou shalt understand yt it which is under the line is the remane^t of the
money not yet paid.

An other example.
8 7 6 6 0 li. 6 7 5 6 0 li. 2 0 1 0 0 li.

Begin at the first place saying, 0 out of 0 remains nothing, set the
figure of nothing under the line: then to the second place 6 out of 6,
remains nothing, set the cipher under the line: then to the third place 5
out of 6 remains 1, set 1 under the line: then to the.iiii. place 7 out of 7
remains nothing, set the figure of nothing under the line, then to the
fyfte place, take 6 out of 8 remains 2, set that under the line, and thus
thou have done. Then 20100 remains yet to be paid.

Now thou shall noote, that sometime it chaunseth that the figure standing
benethe is greatter then the figure standing above him in the sum from whom
subduction is made. In this case thou shalt in thy mind put ten, to the
figure in the upper sum, and then subtrahe the nether figure out of the
same, set the remanaunt under the line, and for the same ten the which thou
dyddest put to ye upper figure to make him gretter, thou shalt add one to the
next figure standing in the nether sum, and then subtrahe that likewise out
of the figure above him, if the figure above be bygger then the figure benethe
with his addition other else equal, and that remains set it under the line,
as ye did in the other example. If the figure above be less then the figure
benethe, then do to him as ye did to the other before: that is to say add
ten to him: and so forth in all other places. Where the nether figure of the
abatour is greatter then the upper figure from whence it should be abatyd:
as by this example ye shall more clearly perceive.

An example.
5 7 2 9 5 4 9 0 4 8 7 6 5 2 9 7 8 5 3 0 1 9 3

Begin your subtraction saying, 7 out of 0 that can not be, therefore
forbycause that 7 standing in the nether sum is more than the figure
standing in the first place of the upper sum, ye must add a ten, then
deduc your 7 out of 10 and there remains 3, then come to the second place
and for the ten that ye borrowed in your mind and a^ ^yd it ye figure in the
first place to make (...) ^ygge enough for the figure under it to (...)
subduced out of it, for the same ten I say ye shall put to ye next figure in
the nether place of the nether sum 1, then say 9 and 1 is 10, then subduce
this 10 out of the figure of 9 standing above it in the vppar sum and that
ye can not, therefore do as ye did before in the first place, put 10 to the 9
in your mind saying 10 and 9 is 19, then deduck the 10 beneth out of the 19
above, and there remains 9 to be set under the line: then to the figure
standing in the third place in the nether sum, put 1 for the ten that ye
borrowed in your mind the which ye addyd to 9 in the second place of the upper
su^me to make it greater: saying 1 and 2 is 3, subtrahe that 3 out of 4 above
it, remains 1 to be set under the line. Then to the fourth place, take 5
out of 5, remains nothing, set a figure of nothing under the line, and come
to the.v. place, take 6 out of 9 remains; to be set under the line, so to
the.vi. place, take 7 out of 2 that can not be, therefore put to the same 2
according to thy rule 10, and the^ it is 12, then subduce 7 out of 12
remains 5 to be set under the line: and for the same 10 that thou borowdeste
in thy mind to put to the figure of 2 in the upper sum, thou shall add 1 to
the figure standing in ye next farther place in the nether sum, coming to ye
same place which is the seventh place saying 8 and 1 the which I have too
set to him is 9, then 9 out of 7 that I can not, wherefore likewise again I
must help the same 7 with a ten and then it is 17 out of that now subtrake
your 9 and remains 8 to be set under the line: now as ye have done before
in all other places for the 10 here borrowed and adjoined, then add 1 to the
next figure standing in the seventh place of the nether number saying, 4 and
1 is 5, then subduce this 5 out of the 5 above and remains nothing, wherefore
set a figure of nothing benethe the line, and so ye have done.

How be it ye shall noote that when ye have a cipher to be written in the last
place of any sum, ye shall not write it, for in the last place it signifies
nothing of it self, neither does it augmente the signification of any of the
other.

Yet one other example will we set and then make an end of Subtraction.

5 0 0 0 0 8 1 0 0 7 1 0 0 4 8 4 0 5 7 4 8 0 0 8 7 5 1 6 0 2 3 5 2 7 0 1 3

Ye shall begin saying, 7 out of 0 that can not be, for ye can not take 7
out of nothing, wherefore as ye have done always in the example before, put
ten to that cipher, and that makes 10, then deduc your 7 out of it now, and
remains 3 to be set under the line: then for this ten that ye add to the
figure in the first place of your upper number, set 1 to the figure standing
in the second and next place of the nether number saying ^ and 1 is 9, then
9 out of the cipher above that can not be, therefore as ye did before make that
0, 10, and then subduce your 9 out of this added 10 remains 1 to be set
benethe the line: then for this 10 likewise, that ye borrowed in the second
place of your upper number, ye shall set one to the next figure standing in
the third and next place of the nether sum, saying, 1 and the 0 is one,
then take that 1 out of 1 above him, remains nothing, set a figure of
nothing benethe the line then to the.iiii. place take ye syfer 0 out of 7
above remains 7 stylle: to be set under the line. So to the.v. place take 8
out of 0 that ye can not, therefore put 10 to the sypher and then subduce it,
and remains 2 set that under the line: for this ten add 1 to the next
figure in the.vi. place, which is 4, then 4 and 1 is 5, and 5 out of 0 that ye
can not, then make 0 10 and take the 5 out of it remains 5 to be set under:
then for the borrowed ten, likewise set to the next figure in the.vii. place
of the nether number 1, saying, 1 and 7 make 8, and 8 out of 1 yt can not be,
therefore put ten to that 1 and then 10 and 1 is 11 out of this 11 deduce your 8
remains 3 to be set under the line: then for this 10 to the next figure in
the.viii. of the nether some set 1 saying, 5 and 1 is 6 the^ 6 out of 8
remains 2, then to the.ix. place, take 0 out of 0 remains also 0, set that
under the line, in the.x. place take 4 out of 0 that can not be therefore put 10
to that 0 and subduce your 4, remains 6, then to the figure in the next
place which is the.xi. put 1 saying 8 and 1 is 9, then 9 out of 0, that can
not be, therefore put ten to it, and then subtrahe your 9 out of 10 remains 1,
set it under the line: for this borrowed ten put one again to the next
figure which is 4, saying 4 and 1 is 5, 5 out of 0 that can not be, therefore
likewise again make it 10, and then take 5 out of it, remains 5, then again
for your borrowed 10 put 1 to the next place: but for because there be no mo
places and therefore subtrahe it alone out of the figure above, saying, 1 out
of 1 remains nothing, therefore nothing is to be set under the line, not so
much as a 0, forbycause it is in the last place. So then the sum under the
line is the remain that remains after the subtractio^ of the lower sum out
of the upper sum.

Here after follows the prove of Subtraction.
The prove of Subtraction.
The prove whether ye have subtrahed well or no, ye must add the remain to
the nombre paid, and if they twain added together do make the first sum
lent completelye then is it well subtrahyd, if not, it is not well subtrahyd, as
by the last example ye may well perceive: for by the rule of addition, add 3
to 7 thereof comes 10, set the sypher under the line and reserve the article
to the next place forth according to the rule of Addition, and thou shalt se
this two sums added together to come to the first lent sum: and this of
Subtraction shall be sufficient.

Of Multiplication.
MVltiplicatio^ is a manner of increasing or augme^ting one sum by another In
this feat of multiplicatio^ are.iii. nu^bres to be noted the multiplied number,
the multiplyer, and the number that redowndeth of the multiplicatio^ of ye
multyplyed number by the multypliar, as in example. Multiply this number 4 by 3
and thereof come 12, 4 is the number multiplied: 3 is the number multiplyer, 12
the third number that redounded of the multiplycatio^ of one of these number
by the other then for more experience and ready workynge in this kind of
operation ye shall perfectely know by memory the multiplication of one dyget by
an other, the which ye shall have here in this table following, of the which
one dygette ye shall look for in the head of the table, and the other in the
left side of the table.

Here after follows the Table.

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 4 8
12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54
60 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 9 18 27 36 45 54
63 72 81 90 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100

By this table ye shall sufficiently learn to multyply one dygette by an other.
As for example, if ye will multiplye 9 by 5, look for the 9, at the heed of the
table, and for 5 the multiplyer at the left side of the table, then with thy
finger descend down from the place where 9 stands till thou come before the
place where the 5 stands and there in the same angle, thou shalt fynge 45,
and that comes of 5 times 9, and so do like wise of other.

There is also a proper rule for ye multiplication of one dygette by an other,
and it is this, when thou will multyply one dyget by an other noote the
distaunce of the greater diget from 10 and by the same distaunce multiplye the
less dyget or equal, and that that proceeds of it deducte out of that
article whom the less number does denominate, and ye rest is it that ye seake
for, as for example: if ye will multyply 7 by 5, first se the distaunce
between 7 which is the greater number and 5, and that is 3, by this 3 multiply
5, and that is 15 then subduce this 15 out of ye article that 5 the less
number does denominate, which is 50, then remains 35, that is 5 times 7: so
likewise shall ye do if the multyplyar and the multiplied be like. How be it
most ready it is to know without book very perfytely the multyplication of
every dyget one in an other.

Now when ye will multyply any one number the one by the other. First write
fair your number to be multyplyed, and under it the multiplicatour, beneth
both these sums, ye shall draw a line. Then shall ye consider whether your
multiplier be a dyget or articly, other else compost number. I^ it be dyget
number ye shall begin to multyply by the dyget the figure or dygette
standing in the fyrs^e place of the number to be multiplied, and that that
comes of it, if it be but a dygette set it vnde the line right under the same
place and the^ proceed forther to the next place and multiply the figure
standing in that place by the same multiplier, and that that redowndeth of it,
if it be a dygette ^ette it likewise under the line r^ghte under the same
place, and so do likewise in every place following, unto such time as all the
figures standing in every place, be multyplyed: then that the which shall be
found under the line is the sum coming of the multiplication of this two
numbers, the one by the other: as by example ye shall the better perceive.

2 3 1 4 2 4 6 2 8

If ye will multyplye this sum 2314 by this 2^ ye shall set your figurs after
this sort, as ye se them. Begin your multiplication saying 2 times 4 is 8,
set that 8 under the line, then come to the next place and say, 2 times 1 is
2, set it under the line, then to the third place, 2 times 3 is 6, set that
under the line, so to the fourth place, 2 times 2 is 4, set that under the line
also, and then thou have done: so that this number 4 28 under the line, is it
that comes of the multiplication of this sum 2314 by this number 2. But if
it be so that in the multiplication of any figure in the number multyplicable,
by the multiplyer that it which redoundyth of it be article number, then ye
shall set a cipher beneth the line right under ye same place where the
multiplycation is, and reserve the article to be addyd to the number that
proceeds of the multiplication of the figure in the next place by the
aforesaid multiplyar, the which likewise if it amounte to an article do
likewise as I bid you to do in the first place: but if it be number composte,
then shall ye set the dyget under the same place beneth the line, and reserve
the article to be addyd likewise as is before said of article number, as in
this example.

8 1 4 1 6 4 2 5 4 0 7 0 8 2 1 0

if ye will multyply this number 8141642 by this figure 5. Begin at the first
place saying 5 times 2 is 10, now forbycause that this number is article, ye
shall according to the rule before, set the cipher under the line, and
reserve the article 1 to be added to the number that precedeth of the
multyplycation of the next figure standing in the next place of the sum
multiplycable, by the multiplyer: so then come to the next place saying, 5
times 4 is 20, to this 20 add 1 for yt article that ye reserved, and that
makes 21, therefore because that this is a composte number therefore set the
digette under the line benethe the same place, and reserve the article to the
next place: then come to the.iii. place saying 5 times 6 is 30, to this add
the article 2 which ye reserved in the place next goinge before, and then it is
32 set the dygette under the line as ye did before reserving the article to
the next place then come to the.iiii. place saying, 5 times 1 is 5 to this add
the article reseruyd, which is 3 and that makes 8, set this digette number
under the line, and then come to the v. place saying, 5 times 4 is 20, now
for because that this number is article set 0 under that place beneth the live
reserving the article 2 to be addyd unto the next place: then comme to the.vi.
place saying, 5 times 1 is 5, to this add the article 2 reserved and then it
is 7, set it under the line: the^ to the.vii. place, saying, 5 times 8 is 40,
now forbycause it is an article number ye shall set a sypher under the line,
and reserve the article 4 too the next place, and for as much as there is no
mo places, ye shall set this 4 under the line next unto the 0 that ye set
down last, and then ye have done. When that your multiplyer is composte or
article, then shall ye take the first figure of your multyplyer, and by him
shall ye multiplye all the fygures of the multiplycable numbers, setting always
that that amounted of it benethe the line as ye did before. And when ye have
multiplied the number multiplycable by the first figure of the multyplyar: then
multiplye it again by the second figure of the multiplyer, setting evermore
the first figure of the number multiplycate, dyrectely under the figure
multiplycatour, in what place so ever it stand: and the number multiplycable
is multiplied by all the figures of the multiplicatour, then make a stryke under
them all, addyng all the numbers multyplycate together as they stand, and that
which proceeds of that addition is the number multiplycable now multyplyed by
the hoole number multyplycatour, as by this example ye shall plainly perceive.

2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 9 3 8 0 7 0 3 5 4 6 9 0 2 3 4 5 2 8 9 3 7 3 0

If ye will multiply this number 2345 by this number 1234, set them first as
ye se here 2, under them draw a line: then begin with the first figure of the
multiplycatour, which is 4, and by him first according to the rule multyplye
all the multiplicable number through out, saying 4 times 5 is 20, set the
cipher under the line reserving the article 2 to the next place: then to the
second place, 4 times 4 is 16, to that put your reserved article 2 and it is
18, set the dygette 8 under the line reserving the article 1: then to the
third place, 4 times 3 is 12 and 1 reserved from the place before that is 13,
set the dyget 3 under the line, reserving the article 1, then to the.iiii.
place, 4 times 2 is 8 and 1 reserved is 9, set that dygette 9 under the line,
and so haste thou multiplied this number multiplicable by the second figure
of multiplicatour, Now then according to the rule before, multiplye the
multiplicable number by the second figure of the multiplycatour saying, 3
times 5 is 15 set the dyget 5 under the line, according to the rule, which
byddeth to set evermore the first figure of the number multiplycate under the
place where ye figure multiplicatour does stand: as here now thou multipliest
the multiplicable by the second figure of the multiplicatour, which is 3, tha^
say 3 times 5 is 15 set this diget 5 under the line, and beneth the first
number multiplicate right under the figure multiplicatour, as thou seeste in
the example, and reserve the article 1: then to the second place of the
multiplycable, 3 times 4 is 12, and 1 that is reserved is 13 set the dyget 3
under the line, as ye se in the example, and reserve the article 1, and so to
the.iii. place 3 times 1 is 9 and 1 reserved is 10, set a sypher under the line
and reserve the article 1: so to the.iiii. place saying 2 times 3 is 6 and 1
reserved is 7 set it under the line, thus have ye done your multiplication by
the second figure of the multiplicatour 3. Then take the.iii. figure of
multiplicatour which is 2, and multiply also all the no^bers multiplicable by
him saying 2 times 5 is 10 set the sypher beneth the line right under the
place where this figure 2 the multiplicator standith, as ye se in the example:
and reserve the article 1, then to the second place 2 times 4 is 8, and 1
reserved is 9, set that 9 under the line: then to the.iii. place, 2 times 3 is
6, set that under the line: so to the.iiii. place saying 2 times 2 is 4 set
that 4 under the line. Now begin to multiply with the fourth and last figure of
the multyplycatour, saying 1 times 5 is 5 set the 5 under the line as I
warened ye before, and as ye se in the example, then to the second place 1
times 4 is 4, set that 4 under the line, then 1 times 3 is 3, set that 3 under
the line, then 1 times 2 is 2 set that 2 under the line and ye have done your
multiplication: then must ye add according to your rule before all this
syngle multiplied number together, and that the which comes of the addition
is the number that comes of the multiplication of this number 2345
multiplycable by the number 1234, multiplicatour. Then come to the first
place, and se what is there, and there ye shall find a 0, set it under the
line, and so to the second place: there ye shall find 5 and 8 which is 13, set
the dygette 3 under the line reserving the article 1 to be addyd to the next
place: then come to the.iii. place, there is 0, 3 and 3 which is 6 to that
add the reserved 1 and that is 7, set that 7 under the line, now to the.iiii.
place, 5, 9, 0, and 9 makes 23, set the 3 under the line, reserve the
article 2, so to the.v. place 4, 6, and 7, is 17, to that add the reserved 2,
which makes 19, set the 9 under the line, and keep ye article 1 in mind
then to the.vi. place 3 and 4 is 7, and 1 reserved is 8 set it under the line,
then too the.vii. place, there find ye but 2, wherefore set it under ye line,
and then have ye done: so that this sum under the line 2893730 is the hole
number multiplicate

An other example of multiplication.
A 6 4 2 6 0 0 3 B 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 8

Your figures set after this sort, A is the multiplicable number. B is the
number multiplicatour. C is the number multiplicate, which comes of the
addition of all the several numbers together standing between the lines. Begin
then your work, taking the first figure of B, the multiplycatour which is 0
and by him multyply all the figures of A, the multiplicable and that that
proceeds of it set under the line as ye se: and so to the second figure of
the multiplicatour which is also 0 multiply all the fygures of A by it like
wise, and set that which comes of it under the line, right under the second
place where the multiplicant figure stands: then to the third figure which
also is 0 multyply all the multyplycable number A, and set that which comes
of it right under the third place benethe the line, as ye se plain in your
example: for of the multiplycatio^ evermore by syphers comes nothing but
ciphers. Now to the.iiii. place of B, the multiplicatour, there shall ye find
the figure 2, multiply then all A the multiplicable number by this figure 2
saying 2 times 3 is 6 set that 6 under the line right under the place where the
multiplicatour 2 stands, as it appears in your example: then to the
second place, 2 times 0 is nothing, set that 0 under the line next the
before said 6, and so to the third place, 2 times 0 is nothing, set the
figure of nothing down under the line, and so to the fourth place, 2 times 6
is 12 set the dygette 2 under the line and reserve the article 1 to the next
place: then come to the.v. place, 2 times 2 is 4 and 1 that I reserved is 5,
set that 5 under the line: now come to the syxthe place, saying 2 times 4 is
8 set that 8 under the line: so to the seuenthe place, 2 times 6 is 12, set
the dygette 2 beneth the line, and reserve the article 1 to be set in the
next and last place as ye se in the example. Thus have ye multiplied A the
multiplycable by.iiii. fygures of B the multiplycatour, therefore now take 0
the v. figure of the multiplicatour: and by also multiplye all the fygures of
A, t^ multiplicable, and thereof shall come a^ syphers to be set under the
line, as ye se^ here in the copye. Then to the sy^the figure of B, the
multyplycatoure wh^che is 5, by this 5 also multyplye all t^ fygures of A the
multiplitable sayen^ 5 times 3 is 15 set that 5 beneth the ly^ right under
the syxthe place where the multiplicatour stands, as is to se in the coopie:
and reserve the article to the next place, then come to the second place and
say 5 times 0 is nothing, set the 1 which ye reserved in your mind under
the line, and so to the third place saying 5 times 0 is nothing, set the 0
under the line: then to the fourth place saying, 5 times 6 is 30, set the
cipher 0 under the line, reseruyng the article 3 unto the next place: then come
to the v. place saying, 5 times 2 is 10, and 3 that I reserved is 13 ^^t the
dyget 3 under the line, and reserve ^e article 1 to be added to the next
place: to the.vi. place saying 5 times 4 is 20 ^d 1 reserved is 21 set 1 the
dygette under ^e line reseruyng 2 the article to the next ^ace: then to
the.vii. and last place say^^ge 5 times 6 is 30 and 2 that was reser^d is 32
set the dyget under the line and ^erue 3 the article to be set in the next and
^e place beneth the line as ye may se ^he example, and so is all finished:
Then ^er all these particular sums draw ^eke, and add all them together,
setting ever that which comes of the addycyon, under the line, as is in the
example: the which shall amounte unto this sum, 3225853506000, and this is
it that comes of the multiplicacyon of the sum A, by the sum B.

As for the multiplycacyon by squares is another worth the writynge nor the
reading: And where as in other copies is set duplacyon, triplacion, and
quadruplacyon, all that is superfluous, for so much as it contained under the
kind of multiplicacyon: and they that are expert in this feet, may right
well perceive it.

The proof of multyplycacion.
THe proof of multiplicacyon may be by two means. By the subducyng out of all
the 9: and the second way is by particion. As concerning the first way: ye
shall first make a cross, then behold the multiplicable number, and subdue
out of it all the nynes, and that that remains not able to make 9 set it
at the upper end of the cross: then come to the multyplycator, and do
likewise in him, and that which remains all the 9 being subducyd, set it at
the under part of the cross: then multiplye the figure standing in the upper
part of the cross by the figure standing in the nether part of the cross, and
out of the same that comes of it take 9 as often as ye can: and that that
remains not able to make 9, set it at the right side of the cross: then come
to the total sum multiplicate, and subduce all the 6 out of him likewise, and
that which remains not able to make 9, set it at the left side of the
cross, and if it be like the figure standinge at the right side of the
cross, then is it well, otherwise it is not well.

An example.^
A 7 9 6 3 B 1 8 5 2 1 5 9 2 6 3 9 8 1 5 6 3 7 0 4 7 9 6 3 C 1 4 7 4 7 4 7 6

To know whether the sum C, be the very sum which comes of the
multyplycacion of A, by B. then first subduce all the 9 that ye find in the
multiplycable A, and the rest set it at the upper end of the cross, which ye
shall find to be 7: Then to ye multiplicatour B. do likewise and se what
remains, and there remains also 7, set ye also of the nether end of the
cross: then multiply this 7 standing in the upper end by 7 standing in the
nether end: and thereof comes 49 when thou have taken all the 9 out of this
49 there will remain 4, the which thou shall set at the right side of the
cross, Then come to C, the total sum of ye multiplication and there likewise
take out all ye 9 that ye find there: and the rest not sufficient to make 9
set it at the left side of the cross, the which thou shalt find to be 4,
and for because that this 4 to be set at the left side is like the figure
sta^dyng in the right side (for that is 4 also) therefore this multiplycacion
is good and well made: and so likewise in all other examples. The proof by
Partitio^ is to divide the total su^me C by the multiplicator B and if ye
quocient be just A than is it well multiplied other else not. But this way can
ye not practyse, unto such time as ye have learned the feate of Particion.

Of particion the fourth Kind of Algorisme.
PArticion is a part of algorisme, by the which ye may easyly diuyde any
greater sum by a less or equal showing how oftentimes the divisor is
contained in the number diuysyble.

In this feate of particion be.iiii. nombers to be noted: the number diuysyble,
the number divisor, the quotient, and the remain if there be any.

Before you come to particion it shall be very needful and necessary for you,
right perfytely to know the table of multiplycacion of dygettes: which is set
in the chapter of multiplycacio^: For unless that ye know that perfitely ye
shall stycke greatly not only in multiplicacion, but also in this feate of
particion, and that exactely had in memory, the rest shall be far easyar. As
for example. if ye will know how often times 7 is contained in 68 ymagyn by
and by that this 7 should be contained 8 times: then if ye know without the
book perfytly the foresaid table ye shall se that 8 times 7 is but 56 ergo 7
is contained more then 8 times in 68, ymagen then and suppose it to be 9 times
in 68, then by the table se what 9 times 7 is, and thou shalt se that it is 64
wherefore thou may conclude that in 68, 7 is contained 9 times and 4 over.

No. ^ ^ quocient. ^ 15077 ^ 3 divisor.

The ^ prove.

To diuyde this number 45231 by 3 the 3 is divisor. First ye shall set down
your nombers to be diuyded, and atthe end of that number on the right hand
ye shall make a streke, wherein ye shall set your quocient, and then set down
your divisor which is 3 under the figure that stands at the uttermost end
at the lift hand that is under 4, and than say how many times 3 may I have in
4, ones 3 and 3 remains over, set 1 within the stryke and that 1 that
remains set over 4 then stryke the duysor 3 with a dasshe of your pen, and
set the dyuisor 3 under the figure 5, then join the article 1 to the dygnet 5,
and it is 15, then say how many times 3 may I have in 15, 5 times 3, set
that 5 in the stryke next to the figure 1 and close up the article 1 and the
dyggette 5 with a cyfer 0 over either of them, and then strike the divisor 3
with a dasshe of your pen, and set the diuysor 3 under the third figure 2, and
se how many times 3 ye may have out of 2 none therefore set down a cyfer 0
within the stryke next to the figure 5 and strike out your divisor with a
dasshe of your pen, and set the dyuysor 3 under the fourth figure 3 then join
the article 2 to the dyggette 3 and that makethe 23 than se how many times 3
ye may have in 23, 7 times, and 3 remains, set that 7 within the stryke
next to the cyfer, and the 2 that remains set over the fourth figure 3 and
close up the article 2 with a cyfer 0, then stryke out the divisor and set it
under the first figure 1 at the right hand, then join the article 2 to the
dygget 1 and it makethe 21, than se how many times 3 ye may have in 21, 7
times and nothing remains, than set the 7 within ye stryke and close the
article 2 with a cyfer 0 over each of them and strike out the deuysor with a
dashe of your pen, and so the third part of 45231 is 15077.

The second example.
No. ^ ^ 6 diuysor. ^ quocyent. ^ 390 5/0 part.

The ^ prove

To dyuyde this number 2345 by ^, the 6 is the dyuysor, begin your division
at the lift hand, as is said in the first example, and set your dyuisor
under the third figure 3, for ye may not have 6 out of 2, and therefore say
how many times 6 may ye have in 23, 3 and 5 remaynethe, set the 3 within the
stryke, and the dygget 5 that remnyneth set it over the second figure, and
close the article 2 with a cipher 0 over it, and then strike out the divisor
with a dasshe of your pen, and set your diuysor again under the third figure
4, and then join the article 5 to the dygget 4, and it is 54, the^ se how many
times 6 ye may have in 54, 9 and nothing remains, set the 9 within the
strike and close up the article 5 and the dygget 4 with a cipher 0 over either of
them, and stryke out the diuysor with a dasshe of your pen, and set the divisor
under the figure 5 and say how many times 6 may ye have out of 5, no times,
therefore set down a cipher 0 with the stryke, and let the 5 stand and stryke
out the dyuysor with a dasshe of your pen, and so the 6 part of 2345 is 390,
and the 5 that remains set at the end of the quocient in this manner. and
so the quocyent is 390

To dyuyde by 2 or 3 fygures, or by as many as pleases you.
First set down your number to be diuyded and your divisor under it,
beginning at the left side at such a place as ye may take the last figure
of your deuysor in the last end, and then se how often ye may have that
figure in ye figure above it, and that set aparte for your quocyent, with the
which quocient ye shall multiply every figure by it self of your divisor and
that that comes of the multyplycacyon, ye shall abate of the figure right
over it, putting out that other figure, and set ye rest above it, and so work
with every figure by it self throughout the diuysor. Then renew your divisor
1 figure forward toward your right hand, as before is rehearsed, and so
continue your word following to the first figure of your number to be divided.
Then it is to be noted that if it hap yt your multiplied number that ye
should abate be more then the number over it, then for a general rule, ye
shall not take your dyuysor out of the figure above it except that it may
sufficientlye yield enough to all the abatementes of the resydue, as more
plainly shall apere in the example following.

No. ^ ^ quocient, ^ 343 7/12 ^ ^ 12 dyuysor ^

The ^ prove.

First set down this number 4123, and diuyde it be your dyuysor 12, begin
your work at your lift hand, setting the article 1 of your deuisor under
4, and ye dygget 2 under the third figure 1, and than se how many times the
article 1 of your diuysor ye many have in the 4 over it, ye would say 4 times
1, but that can not be because there ye may not have ye quocyent 4 multiplied
with the dygget 2 of your divisor, for thereof comes 8, and then that 8 ye may
not take out of 1 over the dygget 2 Therefore say again how many times 2
may ye have in 4, 3 times and 1 remains, set the 3 within the stryke for the
quocye^t, and the 1 that remains set over 4, and strike out the article 2 of
your divisor with your pen. Then multiplye the quocyent 3 with the dygget 2 of
your divisor, and thereof comes 6. Then join the article 1 that remains,
and the digget 1, and it is 11 therout take 6 and there remains 5, set the 5
over ye third figure 1, and close up the article 1 over 4 with a figure over
it, and stryke out ye dygget 2 of your divisor again but one figure forward,
as thus: set the article 1 under the third figure 1 is the No. and the diget 2
under the second figure 2 and there se how many times 1 I may have in 5 that
remains, 4 times, and yet there remains 1 which must be set over 5, and
stryke out the article 1 with your pen. Then multyply the dygget 2 of your
deuisor with the quocient 4 and it is 8, then join the article 1 that
remains, and the dygget 2 in No. together and it is 12, then take the 8 out
of the 12, and there remains 4, set that 4 over the second figure 2 in the
No. and close up the article 1 with a cyfer 0 over it and stryke out the digget
2 of your diuysor with your pen. Then renew your diuysor again as before is
said, and set ye article 1 under the second figure No. and thense how many
times 1 I have in 4, that remains 3 times and 1 remains, set that 3 within
the stryke for ye quocient, and the 1 that remains set over the 4, and stryke
out the article 1 of your dyuysor with your pen. Then multiply the quocient 3
with the digget 2 of your diuysor, and it is 6, then join the article 1 that
remains, and the dygette 5 in No. and it is 13. Then take 6 out of 13 and
there remains 7, set that 7 over the dygget 3 in the No. and close up the
article 1 with a cyfer 0 over it, and stryke out the dygget 2 of your diuysor,
and then the 12 part of 4123 is for the quocyent 343, and the 7 that remains
shall be set at the end of your quocyent, as thus 7/16

Re. 1 Die, 6

Re. 121 Die. 200

^

ye shall note that in these two examples the quocient stands in the mids
betwyxte the two lines, and the number to be divided stands next above the
vppermoste line, and the deuysor standethe next under that nether line. But
than ye must mark that there be two dyuysors, one is called the divisor
current, because it is always remouable toward the right hand in the
operation, and also it is stryken out, and this dyuysor standethe always under
the nether line of the quocyent. The other diuysor is called the diuysor
permanent, for he is not removed nor blotted as the other is, but standethe
always permanent on the lift hand dyrectly against the number that is to be
divided. And just over him there stands the remain of the whole number
which remain can not be divided by the deuysor, and therefore it is set over
the deuysor permanent with a strike betwyxte: as ye may se in the first
ensample, where 1 is remaining, and 6 is deuysor.

^

For as much as in this ensample we can not take 4 which is the divisor, out
of 3, therefore we shall set 4 under 5 and say how many times 4 have ye in 35,
ye have 8 times 4, and there restethe 3, ye shall set the 8 betwyxte the two
lines, and the 3 above 5, then efface the 5 and the 4, then we shall set, 4
under 0 and say, in 30 how many times 4, 7 times, set 7 between the lines at
the right side by the 8, and there rests 2, which we shall set above 0, and
efface 0, than set 4 vnders, and say in 28 how many times 4, 7, and there
rests nothing, set 7 between the lines by the 7, than set 4 under 0 and say
how many times 4 in 0, there is none, therefore set 0 between the lines, then
shall we say in 9 how many times 4, 2 times, set than 2 between the lines,
and restethe 1 which we shall set above 9 and efface 9 than 12 how many times
4, 3 times, set than 3 between the lines by 2, and there rests nothing. Than
in 3 that is the last figure how many times 4, no times therefore at the end
of the figure ye shall set the 3 thus and it is made.

3 2 3 A 3 5 0 8 0 9 2 3 3 C 8 7 7 0 2 3 40 B 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4

Example when the divisor is an article, it behooves to do semblably, in
saying, in 3 how many times 4, no times and therefore we shall set 4 under
5, and 0 under 0, and say how many times 4 in 35, 8 times, set 8 between
the two lines under 5, and there rests 3 which we shall set over 5. Then
set the 3 that stands over 5 and the 0 together, and that is 30, than say
how many times 4 in 30, 7 and always so to the end. And than we shall set 4
under 2, and 0 under 3, and say in 12 in taking the 1 that shall rest of the
sum before and shall be above 9, and the 2 that is after 9, how many times 4,
3 times 4, and then set 3 in the number of C, against 2, and than shall we
cease, for there remains all only 3 to be parted by 40, now we shall not
make 0 under 3 as is before, but at the end we shall set 3 thus 3/40 ^

Ensample when the diuysor is compost, as in this figure before, we shall say in
35 that been nere A, how many times 4 that are in the number of B, 8 time 4 set
that 8 between the two lines in the place of C, and there rests 3 which we
shall set above 5 and efface 35 of A, and 4 of B, then shall we say in
multiplyenge the 8 of C, by the second figure of B, that is 2, we shall say 2
times 8 been 16, than abate 16 of the number of A against the same 42, and
there be 3 which is over 5 and 0 of the number, that be worth 30 and we shall
say, of 30 abate 16 and there restethe 14, of the which 14 we shall set ^
over 3, and efface 3, and 4 above 0 and efface 0, than shall we set the divisor
somewhat forward, the 4 against 0, that shall be effaced, and 2 against 8, and
say in 14 demonstrynge 1 that shall be above 3 and 4 above 0 how many times
4, 3 times, set the 3 benethe the lines in the number of C. and there restethe
2 which we shall set over 4, and efface 4, than shall we say again in
multiplyenge the 3 of C, by the second figure of B, that is 2 we shall say
than 2 times 3 been 6 and of 8 that is against it we shall abate 6 and there
shall rest 2, which we shall set over 8, and efface 8, and always so unto
the end, and when we come to the 2 last fygurs of A, and that we would deuyde
them by 42, we may not, for the first that is but 2 shall be effaced with 1
that standethe above 5 and because that we may take there nothing we shall
set 0 against 2 of A, in the number of C, between the lines, and so it is
done, and there shall rest 3 to be divided by 4^, and that 3 shall be set at
the end of the particion as thus 3/42 and it is finished.

And it is to be known that as many fygures as follows the first figure in
the number of B, shall be multiplied by them of the number of C, then the
multyplycacion that thereof shall come ye shall abate in the number of A, as in
this ensample shall more plainly appear.

^

The ^ prove.

In this ensample in the number of B, that is the deuysor, be many figures, and
therefore we shall say, in 3 of A, how many times 2 of B, 1 time, set that 1
upon C and 1 that remaynethe of 3, over 3, and than shall we come to the 4 of B
and to 1 of C, and multyplye them in saying, 1 times 4 is 4, which 4 we shall
abate of the number of A, in taking 1 above 3 and 5 after 3, that shall be
worth 15 and thereof we shall abate 4 and there rests 11, and for the more
shorteste way of 5 only abate 4, and set the 1 that remains above 5, and
there restethe always 11, then shall we come to the 3 of B, and to 1 of C, and
make all only the multiplycacio^ in saynege 1 times 3 been 3, thanne of 10
abate 3 in demonstrynge 1 over 5 and 0 after, and then there rests 7, which
we shall set over 0, then because of the cyfer 0 may nothing come, we shall
leave it, and goo to the next figure and say 1 times 5 that is at the last
end of B ben 5 but in so much that we may nothing abate of 0 that is
against it in the number A we shall borowe of the figure before that is 3
only one and efface the 8, and set the 7 above the 8, and the 1 that we
shall hold shall be worth 10 to the regard of the number that we be in, then we
shall say of 10 abate 5 there restethe 5 which we shall set above 0, then shall
we auaunte our partetour co^seque^tly under the other fygurs following, that is
to say till the last of B, be set under the last of A, and then ye may not
auaunce them any further because ye be come to the ends of both the numbers.

The prove of division or particyon is made in this manner: ye shall first make
a cross, as ye did before in multiplycacion and abate the 9 of the particyon,
and set the rest at the lift end of the cross semblably of ye third
number that is betwixt the two lines, and set the rest at the right end of
the same cross, and if there be no thing rest set 0, Then multyply ye two
no^bers of figure, for they 2 be dyggettes that one by that other, and thereof
abate all the 9, if there be nothing in the first number, or if ye may not
divide it join it with the same that shall come thereof. And so the rest that
may not make 9 set it at the end under the cross. Then shall we come to
the first number and semblably do away the 9 thereof, and set the rest above
the cross, and if that above and that beneth be like, the particion is good,
or if not, it is false. And for to understand it better we make proves by ye
ensamples aforesaid.

prove ^
For the first we shall take the partetour that is 4 and set it at the lift
side of the cross, than shall we abate the 9 of the third number, and there
rest 8 which 8 we shall set at the right end of the cross and multiplye
it by 4 and thereof comes 32 whereof rests 5 then adiouste them with the 2
farthynges that we might not deuyde, and they shall make 7, the which 7 we
shall set under the cross, than shall we abate the 9 of the first number that been the farthynges, and there shall rest 7 which 7 we shall set at the upper
end of the cross, and so ben the two ends like and it is well made.

Reduction.
REduction is a kind of Algorisme by the which ye be taught to reduce numbers
of less denominacion or value to numbers of more denominacion or value: or if
the case require it, numbers of great denominacion to the numbers of less
value. Example of the first. 20. li. 63. s. 44. d. 10. far. Thus reduce the
farthinges to pens, and the pens to shelynges, and the shelynges to pounds:
and then this sum is 23 li. 6 s. 10 d, and 2 far. so have you reduced the
less sum to ye more. Example to reduce the more to the less. Take the same
example again, and reduce the 20 li. 63 s. 44. d. 10. far, all in to
farthinges, and it will make 22410 farthinges. First reducynge the powndes to
shelynges, then to pens, and all that pens to farthinges: wherefore it shall be
very necessary for you to know what thing your number does signify,
whether wayght, money measure, or time: and to be expert in all manner of
accomptes: it shall be necessary for you to know all manner of wayghtes, coins,
measures, and time. Example in englysh money 4 farthinges make 1 d. 12. d.
makes a shelynge 20 shelynges makes a pound.

In weight, and first of troy weight, every pownde has 12 ounces, and every
ounce 20 penny weight, and every penye weight 20 graynes. etc.

The haperdepeys pownd has 16 ounces, an ounce 8 drammes, the dram 3
scruples, the scruple 20 graynes.

Of measure, the yard has 3 foot, the foot 12 inches, the ynche 3 barley
corns of length.

Of time, the year has 365 days, the day 24 hours, the hour has 60
minutes, every minute 60 secondes, every second 60 third, every third 60
quartes, every quartes 60 fyftes, every fyfte 60, syxtes, and so forth
infinitely.

To reduce the more sum to the less.
When thou will reduce the more to the less, look how many times the less
is contained in the more, and by that number multiply the number of the more
and that that comes of the multyplycacyon shows the more reducyd to the
less.

Example. I would reduce 8 d. to farthynges look how many times a farthynge is
contained in a penny, and that is as ye know 4 times, then multiplye according
to the rule 8 by 4, and that makes 32 which be 32 farthynges, and so 8 d,
makes 32 farthynges.

An other example. Here is a sum of 28 li. and 6 s. I would have this
powndes, which is of more denomynacyon reduced to the shelynges, which be of
less denominacion: then look first how often a shelynge is contained in a
pound, and that is 20 times, for 20 s. makethe a li. multiply then the 28 li.
by 20, thereof comes 560, which be all shelynges: to this put the other 6
shelynges and so all is 566 shelynges.

But ye shall note that where there be any sum of mean denominacyons between
the more to be reduced and the less to whom reduccyon is made: then shall it
be easy ar to reduce first the more to the mean, and so by the mean to the
less.

The example. 43 li. 19 s. 20 d. 4 farthynges. if ye will reduce all this
sums to the farthinges: then shall it be better for you to reduce ye powndes
first to shelynges and then being shelynges to reduce them to pens, and at
the last to farthynges: so by your rule 43 pownde makes 860 shellynges, to
that add the 19 shellynges, it makes 879, then reduce this 879 shellynges to
pens: look first how many pens are contained in a shelynge, and that is 12,
multyply 879 by 12 thereof comes 10548 which be all pens, to this add your
20 pens, and that makes 10568 d. then reduce this pens to farthynges, se how
many farthinges be in a penny that is 4, multyply 10568 by 4 comes 4^272 to
these add the 4 farthynges and that makes 42279 farthinges. Thus have ye
reduced 43 li. 19 s. 20. d, 4 farthynges the more by the mean to the less.

To reduce the less to the more.
First mark how many times the more does contain the less: and by that
number dyuyde the less, and the quocie^t shows the less reduced to the more.

Example. I would have this sum 5600 s. reducyd into powndes: for how many
times a pound does contain a shelyng that is 20 times, then diuyde 5600 by
20 the quocyent shall be 280, which be powndes: so that 5600 s. reduced to
powndes makes 280 li. and so likewise in all other rekeninges.

When sums of diverse denomynacyons come in addition to be addyd together,
then beginning at the sums of least denominatio^: add them over together
till such time as they make a number of the next denominacion, and that that
remains not able to make any number of greater denominacion, set it under the
line and proceed to the next sum of greater denominatio^, to the which add
the number of the same denomination reducyd out of the sum before of the less
denominacion, so procedynge to the end.

Ensample.
li. s. d. far. 1680 10 5 3 8200 29 7 2 1008 3 10 3

Begin at the least which be farthynges: saying 3 and 2 ben 5, and 3 ben 8
this 8 farthynges make 2 pens, therefore take this pens and add them to the
next sum which is of the same denomination, saying 2 and 10 be 12 d. which is
1 shyllynge the 7 and 5 be 12 which also makethe a shelynge, so emonge these
pens ye have ^ shelynges to be added to the next order of shelynges, saying 2
and 3 be 5 and 9 be 14, put the diggette 4 under the line, and reserve the
article 1 to the next place fayenge 1 and 2 be 3 and 1 be 4, set that 4
under the line also and then is it 44 s. the which reduced to pounds makethe
2 li. and 4 s, remains under the title of shelynges: then put that 2 li. to
the other powndes, and so haste thou done in reduccion of the sums of less
value to the greatest sum, which be powndes. And this is sufficiently entreatyd
of reduccio^.

Here follows of progressyon.
PRogressyon shewethe the number when it begynnethe at 1 or at 2 in mountynge
always by one, and one, as does this number 123456789.

Now if ye will know the valor of the numbers first ye must regard two
things, that is to wit, if the number proceed continually without leuynge any
thing betwyxte as here 1234567 or if it leave any thing betwyxte as here, 13576.

Secondly ye must consider if the number be even or odd. And after these two
consyderacyous, then by four rules that here follows ye may know the valor
of each whole number.

The first rule is when one number proceeds in mountinge always contynually
in the beginning, then if it end in an even number, than shall we take the
half of that even number, and by it we shall multiply the odd number that
comes of the even number, as ye may se in this ensample following.

Ensample.
12345678 4 9 36

if ye will know how much this number is worth, than multyply the half of 8
that is 4 and the number that is after 8 is 9, and then thereof comes 36, and
so much is the sum worth, and thus may ye do with all such like questions.

An other example.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 4 7 28

The ^ prove.

For to multyply this number 7 wherein the greatest and the more half is 4 ye
must multyply 7 by 4 and it is 28, and so much in the hole sum,

The third is, if a number proceed not continually, and end in an even number
ye shall take the half of the said number that is even, and by him multiplye
the same that is next coming after the same half, and in thus doing, ye
shall have the sum of the same ^umber.

An example.
2 4 6 8 4 5 20

The ^ prove

If ye will know how much this number is worth, than take the half on 8 that
is 4, then multyplye by the 4 the number which follows, that is 5 in saying
4 times 5 is 20, and so much is worth the whole sum.

The fourth is when the said number proceeds not co^tynually, then if it end

Here follows the rules, and first the rule of three.
MVltiply by the contrary and divide by the semblau^t or like. This rule may
be understand in two manners. First multiplye the same that ye will bye by his
contrary, that is to wit, by the price, and divide by the semblaunte that is
to wit, by as much as ye have bought: or thus, multiplye ihe price by his
contrary, that is to wit, by the same that thou wylt bye, and divide it by
his semblaunt, that is that same that ye have bought. And note ye why it is
called the rule of three, for with three no^bers certain ye may know and find
the fourth number uncertain. And it is a rule right no table and necessary in
the fayct of marchau^dyse. For to have knowledge of this rule, it behooves to
set some rules dyfferent in manner of questyons, and fyrke in measures long.

The rule of hole numbers.
If 9 else of cloth cost 25 crones, how much shall cost 15 by the price.
Answer. It behooves you to set the sum, that is to wit, 25 crones. And tha^
ye shall multiply by his contrary, that is to wite, by 15 that been 375, and than
divide them by that semblaunt, that is to w^te, by 9, and thereof comes 41
crones and an half, and there remains 1 crone and and half, the which ye
shall make in sz. and there ben 54 sz. the which ye shall divide by 9 and
thereof comes 6 sz. Therefore ye may answer that the 15 else shall cost 41
crones and an half and 6 sz. Now if ye will make the prove it behooves you to
form your question thus if 15 else cost. 41 crones and an half and 6
shyllynges, how much shall cost 9 else by the price. Then it behooves you
first to multiplye the 6 sz, by 9 and that be^ 54 then it behooves you to make
thereof crones, that is 1 crone an an half, and then ye shall multiplye the 41
crones and an half by 9, and they ben 373 crones and an half, and then set
thereto 1 crone and an half, and they be 375 crones which ye shall deuyde by
15, that been 25, the which 25 ben the price of 9 else, and so the rule is
good, and thus ye may do of all other semblable.

The second rule of hole nombers with numbers broken semblable.
if 10 else and 2 third parts of cloth cost 35 franc. how much shall cost
14 else by the price. Answer. For to know this rule and other semblable: it
behooves you to reduce the else bought, and them that ye will bye all into
thyrdes because of them that be bought, in saying thus, 3 times 10 ben 30, and
set thereto 2 thyrdes, that is than 32 thyrdes. Then it behooves you to make
deuysion by 32, and than ye shall reduce the 14, else in to 1 third, in
saying 3 times 14 been 42. Then 42 shall be the multiplicator. Now set the
sum, that is to wit 35 franc. the which multiplied by 42 be 1470 the which
dyuyded by 32 thereof comes 45 franc. and an half, and there rests 14 fran,
the which ye shall reduce to shyllynges, and than deuyde them by 32 and thereof
comes 8 shyllynges, and an half, there rests 8 shyllynges, and than shall
ye make them in pens, and dyuyde them by 32, and thereof comes 3 pens, therefore
ye may answer that the 14 else of clothe shall cost 45 francz and an half
8 shyllynges and an half and 3 pens.

For to make the prove it behooves you to make your work by the contrary, for
it behooves you to multyplye the sum that the 14 else cost by the deuisor,
and dyuyde it by the multiplycatour. Therefore set the sum upon the lift
side, and first multiplye the 3 d, by 32, and when they be multiplied ye shall
make of them shyllynges, and then ye shall multyplye the 8 sz. and the half by
32, and then make thereof francz. And then ye shall multyply the 45 francz and
the half by 32, and deuyde them by 42, and so ye shall know if the rule be
well made.

The third rule of hole numbers with diverse minutes.
if 4 else and 2 thyrdes of clothe cost 10 crones, how much shall cost 6
else and 2 quarters by the price, For to know this rule, it behooves you first
to reduce the 4 else and 2 thyrdes thus, 3 times 4 ben. 12 And than ye shall
adioyne the 2 thyrdes, and than it is 14. And than the else that ye will bye,
ye shall reduce them in to one fourth thus, 4 times 6 ben 24. And then set
the 2 quarters thereto and than there is 26 quarters. And than ye shall
multiplye that one by that other, that is to wit the nombrant of the first
by the denomina^t of the second, in saying 4 times 14 ben 56. And those 56
shall be the deuysor. Than multiply the numbrant of the second, by the
denominant of the first in saying 3 times 26 ben 7^, and those 78 shall be
the multiplicator. And therefore set 10 crones and multiplye them by 78, and
divide them by 57. And ye shall find that the 6 else and 2 quarters cost 11
crones and an holfe, 15 shyllynges and 5 pens. And there rests 8.

The example.
Deuisor M 59 142 242 78 10 crones 246 2 3 4

If 4 else cost 10 crones, 6 else 2/4 shall cost 13 crones and an half 15
shyllynges 5 pens, there rests 8.

For to make the prove it behooves you to work the contrary, for it behooves
you to multiplye the sum by the diuisour, that is to wit, by 59, and make
division by the multiplicatour, that is to wit, by 78 and ye shall find 10,
otherwise if there be more or less the rules he false.

The fourth rule containing hole nombers to the marchaundyse that ye have
bought and minutes to the same that ye will by.

if 8 else of cloth cost 15 crowns, how much shall cost two quarters by the
price. For to know this rule ye must reduce the 8 else into quarters, in
saying 4 times 8 ben 32 then 32 shall be the deuysor, and the 2 quarters
shall be the multiplycator. Now set the 15 crones and multyply them by 2
quarters, and divide by 32 and ye shall find that the 2 quarters cost 0
crones and the half 15 shyllynges and an half 3 pens. For to make the prove
ye must work the contrary, for ye shall multiply the sum that the 2 quarters
cost, that is to wit, 0 crones, and the half 15 sz. and an half 3 pens by
32 and dyuyde them by 2.

The rule of round measures, that is to wit, measure of corn of wine and
oil.

First it behooves you to presuppose and know the measures of corn.

One muy is worth 12 septiers

One septiers is worth 4 mynotes.

One mynot is worth 3 busshelles.

One busshell is worth 4 quarters,

The measures of wine.
One muy of wine holds 36 septyers

The septyer holds 4 quarters.

The quarte holds 2 pyntes.

The pynt holds 2 choppynes.

The choppyne 2 half septiers.

The half septer 2 possions.

The first rule.
If the muy of corn cost 10 francz, how much is worth the busshel. Answer.
For to know this rule ye must know how many busshels ben in 1 muy, Therefore
multiply the muy by 12, and than by 4, and than by 3, which ben 144
busshelles, the which shall be the deuysor of 10 francz therefore deuyde 10 by
144. And thereof comes 1 sz 4, d. and an half, rests 24. d. Therefore the
bushel costeth 1 sz. 4 pens and an half, rests 24 d.

The second rule.
To the contrary, if the busshell cost 1 sz. how much shall cost a thousand
and 4 hondreth Muys by the price. Answer, For to know this rule, it behooves
you to make all the Muys in busshels. And there be 201600 bushels, the which
it behooves you to multiplpe by 2, and there be 403200, and of them ye shall
make crones. Therefore deuyde by 36, and there ben 1^20^ crones. Therefore ye
may answer that if the bushel cost 2 sz. a thousaunde and 4 hondreth muys
shall cost enleuen thousand and 2 hundredth crones, and thus ye may do of all
other semblable.

The third rule.
if the septier of corn be worth 1 francz and the lote of penny torneys weight
12 ounces, how much ought it to weygh when ye septer is worth 15 tornoys.
Answer. Multiply the first number by the second, that is to wit, 20 by 12,
and deuyde it by 15, and ye shall find that it ought to wegh 16 ounces. And
thus ye may do of al other like.

If the muy of wine be worth 12 francz how much ought the pynte to be worth
Answer. For to know this questyon, it behooves you to reduce the 12 muys into
septyers, from septiers into quartes, and from quarters into pyntes, and that been 188 pyntes. And than ye shall reduce the 12 francz in to sz. that been 240,
and that into pens, that been 2880 pens, the which behonethe you to deuyde by
288 and it comes to 10 d. Therefore if the muye of wine cost 12 francz, the
pynte is worth 10 d. But it is requisite that the Tauerner have some gaynes if
ye sell 12 d. the pynt. I demand how much shall he win upon the muy:
Answer. He sells it 2 d. more than it is worth therefore multyply 288 pyntes
by 2 and they be 576, the which ye may deuyde by 12 and there shall be 48 sz.
Therefore may ye answer that he gets 48 sz. upon the muy.

if the muy cost 10 francz how much is worth the pynt. Answer. It behouethe
you to do as is above said: and ye shall find that it is worth 8 pens and 1
third. if the pynt cost 6 pens, how much shall cost 12 muys by the price.
Answer. It behooves you to know how many pyntes ben in a muy, that is 288,
multyplye 12 muys by 288 that is 3456, pyntes. And than multiply the pyntes by
6 that been 207, 6, of whom ye shall make sz by diuysion. and there ben 10728
sz, and of shyllynges ye shall make francz. Therefore ye shall make diuysyon by
26, ye shall find 86 francz 8 sz. Therefore ye may answer that the 12 muys
shall cost 86 francz 8 sz.

In so myche as competently we have tracted of the rule of three in the fayct of
measures, it is expediente that we tracte thereof in the faycte of weyghte.
if an hondreth pounds of peper cost 20 sz. how much shall cost 6 pound by
the price: Answer. For to know this question, ye must multyply by the
contrary and deuyde by the semblaunt, that is to wit, multiplye by 6 and
dyuyde by 10, and ye shall find that the 6 pounds shall cost 1 francz, and 4
sz. To make the prove ye must multiplye by 100 and dyuyde by 6. Now I demand
of the 6 pounds cost 1 franc 4 sz, how much is worth the ounce. For to know
this ye shall make the pounds in ounces, the which ben 96 ounces, and then
make the money in pens, the which ben 288 d. the which ye shall deuyde by 96
and thereof comes 3 pens, therefore the ounce shall cost 3 pens.

If one li of saffron cost 3 francz and an half, how much is worth the ounce.
Answer. It behooves you to know that in a pound ben 16 ounces, therefore
deuyde the 3 francz, and the half by 16 and ye shall find that the ounce is
worth 4 sz. 4 d. and an half, and thus ye may do of other like. If 4 pound
of saffron cost 16 fran. 6 sz 8 d. how much shall cost 3 quartrones by the
price. For to know this rule, ye shall reduce the 4 li. in thyrdes and shall
say ^ times 4 ben 12, and 1 third ben 14 then ye shall multiply by 4, and
shall say 4 times 14 ben 56 the deuysor, than for the second number we shall
say, 3 times 3 ben 9 fourthes or quarters, the which 9 shall be the
multiplyer. Now set the 16 francz 6 sz 8 d. tournoys, and multiplye them by 6
and deuyde them by 16, and thereof comes 2 fran. and an half, 2 sz. 6 d.
therefore ye may answer that the 3 quarters shall cost 2 fran. and an half 2
sz. 6 d. For to make the prove ye must work by the contrary in multyplyenge by
the diuysor, that is to wit by 56 and make diuysyon by 9, and so may ye do of
other semblable.

If one pound of tyn cost 9 blances, how many hundredth shall I have for a
thousand and 4 hundredth francz. It behooves you to know how much is worth ye
hunderth by 9 blances the pound. And ye shall find that there is 12 francz and
an half. Now make diuysion of 1400 frances by 12 frances and an half, ye
shall find 112. Therefore ye may say that I shall have 112 pound of tynne for
1400 frances, And also as we have made this rule, ye may do in all other
marchandyses, as in lead, iron, spyces peper, sugar. And as we have done of
pounds ye may do of quartrons, ounces, and al other weyghtes,

A rule which is without time
Three merchants put their monye together for to have gaynes, ye which have
boughte such marchaundyse as has cost 125 francz, whereof the first has
laid 15 francz. The second 64 sz. and the third 36, fz. And they have gotten
54 franc. of clear gaynes. I demand how shall they divide it, so that each man
have gains according to the money that he has laid down. Answer. In all
such rules and questions ye shall multiplye each one after the money that he
had laid, therefore multiplye the gains for the first by 25 and divide by 125,
that is the divisor commune. For the second multiplye the gaynes by 64, and
dyuyde by 125 the divisor commune. And for the third multiply the gains by
36, and dyuyde 125 the deuysor commune. And for to find the deuysor commune, ye
shall set together the multiplycatours, that is to wit 25, 64 and 36 which is
125 the deuysor commune. And so shall ye do in all rules of company Now ye may
find and know how much each one has of gains, and ye may se it by the
ensaumple here present.

The first has 10 fz and half 2 sz. The second has 27 fz and half 2 sz.
and half 5 d. and half, rests 2 d. and half, The third has 15 fz and
half 5 sz. rests 60 pens.

256436 125 Multiplicatour Dyuysour.

And they have yet to be divided among them of restes 62 d. and and half.

For to make ye prove it behooves you to diuyde the restes, and than reduce all
togithers, and ye shall find the sum divided, for all the rules of company
ben proved by addicion of sommes.

The second rule of hole time.
Four merchants lay money together for wynninge for a certain time, of
whom the first has laid 10 fz. for two year. The second 20 fran. for 3
year. The third 100 francz for one year. And the fourth has laid 40 franc.
for 4 year: and they have gained 454 fran. I demand how much each one ought
to have of winnynge after the money that he has laid, and after the time that
he has holden his money in gain for company. Answer. For to know this rule
and other semblable, ye shall multiplye the monye that each one has laid by
the time that he has holden it in company. Example. The first has laid 10
fran. for 2 year, therefore it behooves you to multyplye 10 by 2 in saying 2
times 10 ben 20. For the second 3 times 20 ben 60. For the third 1 time 100
is an 100. For ye fourth 4 times 40 ben 160. and then it behooves you to find a
dyuysor common, for each has his multiplycator, that is to wit, the same
that he has laid, and for to find it ye shall set together all the
multiplycatours, that is to wit the 20, 60, 100, 160 the which makes 340,
therefore these 340 shall be the dyuysor commune to all, then how much each
one ought to have ye may se by the ensample here following 454 sz. The first
has 26 francz and half 4 sz. one penny, rests 140. d,

The second has 80 frances 2 sz 4 d. rest 80 pens

The third has 134 frances 1 sz. 5 pens, rest 20 pens.

The fourth has 213 franc. and an half 2 sz and a half 5 d. rest. 100 pens.

20, 60, 100, 160, 340 Multiplycatours. Dyuysour.

Of rest they have to divide one penny.

The rule of company where as is hole time and parts of time.
Three merchants lay money in company for to have gaynes thereby, of whom the
first has laid 30 frances for two years. The second has laid 400 fran.
for one year and three months. And the third has laid 60 fran. for three
years and two months. And they have gained with this money 44 franc. I
demand how they shall deuyde it to the end, that each one have his right
after the money and the time that they have set and holden for to gain.
Answer. For this rule and all other semblable, ye shall multiply the time by ye
money, as we have said above but for as much as there be months ye must set
and reduce all the time of each one in months, and also if there were any
days ye should set all the time in days. The first has laid 30 frances
for 2 years, in 2 years ben 24 months, therefore multyplye 30 by 24 there
been 720, and these 720 shall be the multyplycatoure of the first. The second
has laid 40 fran. for 1 year and 3 months, in one year ben 12 months,
and 3 does make 15 months, multyplye 40 by 15, they make 600 which is the
multiplycatoure of the second. The third has laid 60 francz for 3 years
and 2 months, 3 years ben worth 36 months and 2 been 38 months. Now
multyplye 60 by 38, and there ben 2280, which shall be the multiplicatour of
the third. Now for to have a dyuysor comune, ye shall set together all the
multiplycatours that is 3600 the dyuysour comune. They have to deuyde 44
francz. The first has 8 francz, and half 6 sz rest ^. The second has 7
frances. 6 sz. and half. rest 0. The third has 27 francz and half 7 sz. 4
pens, rest 0.

720, 600, 2280,, 360^. Multiplycatours Dyuysour

A rule of diverse silver and diverse time.
Three marcau^htes have made company together of whom the first has laid 10
francz. 4 shyllynges for 2 months. The second has laid 15 fra^. for one
year. And the third has laid 6 francz 7 sz for 8 months, and they have
gotten of this money 24 francz. How they shall dyuyde it after the money and
after this time I demand. Answer. For to know this rule and all other
semblable it behooves you to reduce the money of every man in shyllynges. And
all the time in months. And then multiplye the money by the time. Ensample.
The first has laid 10 francz that been 200 sz. and 4 ben 204 the which ye
shall multyplye by 2 months, and they shall be 408 the multiplicatour of the
first. The second has laid 15 francz for one year, and in 15 francz ben 300
sz. and in one year ben 12 months, therefore multiplye 300 by 12, and there
shall be 3600 the multyplyecatour of the second. The third has laid 6
francz 7 shyllynges, and in 6 fra^. ben 120 sz. and 7 ben 127 sz. for 8
months, therefore multiply 127 by 8, and they shall be 1016 the multiplicator
of the third. And for to have the deuysor comune, ye must reduce together all
the multiplicators, and that shall be the deuysor commune, as ye may se by the
example following. They have 24 frances of winning.

The first has 2 francz and half 8 sz. and half 5 pens and half restethe
1360 pens. The second shall have 17 francz, 3 sz. and half d. rests 1952
pens.

The third shall have 4 sz. and half, 7 sz, 0 pens, and half rests 17112
pens.

408, 3600, 1016 5024. Multiplicatours. Dyuysor.

And they have to deuyde 1 d. of the restes For to make the prove ye shall
reduce together the three sommes that they have had. And if there be more or
less the rule is evil made.

Here follows the rule of company of factours with merchants servants.
OF this rule of factours ye may make 3 rules in manner of questyo^s that fall
among merchants. Example, 8 merchants 5 factours, and 3 servants or
varlettes have made company together, and have clearly gotten 150 fran. whereof
the factours ought to have the half of the merchants, and the servants
the third part of the factours, how shall they dyuyde these 150 franc. Answer
For all such rules and questions it behooves you to find a number wherein is
an half and a third, and that shall be 6, and these 6 shall be for the
merchant. And the half of 6 ben 3, that shall be for the factours, and the
third part of the factours is 1 which shall be for the servants. And than ye
shall multyplye the one by ye other, that is to wit, the personages by their
number, 6 times 8 ben 48, and these 48 shall be the multiplicator of the
merchants. And than there ben 5 factours, that have 3 and 3 times 5 ben 15,
and than there ben 3 servants that have 1, and 1 times 3 is 3, and therefore
the factours shall ye multiplye by 15 and the servants by 3. Now for to find
the dyuysor comune ye shall set together all the multyplycatours, that is to
wit, 48, 15, 3, which been 66 these 66 shall be the dyuysor commune. Example
they have to dyuyde 150 francz. The merchants have 109 franc. 1 sz. and half
3 d, and half, rests 21 d.

The factours have 34 fran. 1 sz. and half 3 d. and half, rests 21 d.

The servants have 6 fran. and half 6 sz. 4 d. rest 24 pens.

48, 15, 3 66 Multyplycatours Dyuysor.

They have to deuyde 1 penny of restes For to make the prove ye shall dyuyde all the restes by the dyuysor comune. And than ye shall reduce all together, for to
have 150 frances.

The rule of factours the which gate the half of the gain and of the
princypall.
And other rule in manner of a question a merchant has given 50 franc. to his
factor by such covenant that he govern them for 10 years. And at the end of
the time, that is to wit, at the end of 10 years. And at the end of 10
years, they shall dyuyde the gain and the principal It happens that the
factour will go his way at the end of 6 years, and he fyndeth that he has
gained a thousand francz. I demand how ought the said factour to be paid,
and how much ought the said marchaunte to have: Answer. ye ought to regard
how much he should have gained in those 10 years that he should have holden
them in gain as he had promised. Therefore ye may form the questyon, if 6
have gotten a thousand: how much shall be the gaynes of 10. Multyplye 1000
by 10 and dyuyde by 6 and ye shall find that he should have gutten 1666 fran,
and an half 3 sz. 2 pens. Of the which gaynes the merchant ought to have the
half that been 833 francz. 6 shyllynges and half and 1 penny. And than take up
those 833 fran. 6 shylynges and half 1 penye of 1000 francz that he has
gained, and there remains 166 frances, 13 shyllynges 5 pens for the factour.
Now ye may answer that the merchant shall have of the gaynes 833 francz 6
shyllynges, and half 18. And the half of the princypall, that is to wit of
50, that is 25 and there ben 852 francz. 6 sz. and half 1 d. And the factoure
shall have of gain 166 francz. 13 sz. 5 pens. And of the princypall 25 that been 191 fran. 13 sz 5 d. And thus may ye do of all other semblable. And it is
proved by the reductyon of the two sommes gained.

The third rule of factours with couenauntes, yt the factour shall gain the
half of the princypall.
An other rule of company of factours and merchants with conuenaunt that the
factours shall gain the half of the princypall and not of the gain. Example.
A merchant gives unto his factoure 400 fran. that he shall govern them for 6
years, and at the end of the time the half of the princypal shall be to the
factour. It happens the factour will go his way at the end of 2 years, and
has gained 200 fra^. I demand how ought the factour to be paid. Answer. ye
ought to regard how much he should have gained if he had served all his time,
and for to find it ye may work by the rule of three, for ye must multiplye by
his contrary, that is to wit by 6, and diuyde by his semblau^t that is to
know, by 2, in saienge if 2 have gained 200 frances: how much shall 9 gain,
and ye shall find that he should have gotten 900 franc, and he gained but 200
franc. wherefore he ought to make a gain 400 fran. to the merchant: and he
ought to have the half of ye principal, that been 200 frances, therefore he owes
200 unto the marchaunte, and so he has lost all his time, and 200 fran. of
advantage for the merchant ought nothing to lose like as he had accomplyshed
all his time

The third rule of chaunges for to use deceyte or fraud.
Two merchants will change their marchau^dyse, and the one begyled the other
the one has peper, and that other cloth. He that has peper will sell for 25
franc. the hondereth by change, which is no more worth than 20 fran. in
silver contented. I demand for how much ought the other to sell unto him the
elle of his cloth, that is worth but 15 sz. to keep him self from loss.
Answer. For the rule of three ye may say thus, if 20 frances of content give
me 25 fran. at the change how much shall give me 15 of content. It behooves
you to multiplye the 25 by 15. which ben 373, the which ye shall dyuyde by 20
and thereof comes 18 sz. 9 d. therefore ye may say that he shall sell the elle
of clothe for 18 shyllynges 9 d. And thus may ye do of all other.

Two merchants will change their marchaundyse, of whom that one has 100
pound of wolle, that is no more worth but 15 crones. And he will change with
an other in a pyce of cloth that is worth 21 crones, and he will give him the
wolle for 17 crones. I demand for how much ought the other to sell the peyce
of clothe to the end that he be not betromped ^ Answer. By the rule of three
when 15 are worth 17 demand how much shall be worth 21 Dyuyde by 15 and ye
shall find the same that ye require.

Two marchantes will change their marchaundyse, and the one defraude that other
that has peper, and will sell it 24 fran. the hondreth by change. which is
no more worth but 20 frances in money content, and he will have the half in
money content. I demand for how much ought the other to sell the elle of his
cloth that is no more worth but 15 sz. Answer, ye must take away the money
content that the other demands, that been 12 franc. for the just price, and
of the which he will sell over. Therefore take away, and withdraw 12 of 20
franc. which is the just yrice, and there rest 8 fran. for 8 and 4 ben 12, And
ye may say by the rule of three, if 8 give me 12, what shall give me 15 sz.
which is the just price of the clothe, multyply 12 by 15 and dyuyde by 8, and
thereof comes 22 sz. 6 d. And therefore the merchant ought to sell the elle of
his cloth after 22 sz, 6 d. else he should have loss And thus ye ought to do of
al manners of chaunges and barathes, for if he yt has the peper, demanded but
the third or the fourth or 2 or 3, abate all only the same yt he shall
demand, and then by the rule, as is said. And note ye well that if he will
multiplye shyllynges, ye shall have shyllynges. And of crones ye shall have
crones, and of frances ye shall have frances And in like manner of all other.

Here follows many rules and questions to have the more knowledge of ye
science of arismetryke, and the first is of collectes and tallyages.
Ten men owe unto the king of collecte and tallyage 244 fran. I demand
how shall they diuyde them to the end that each one pay after the valor of
his goods, for it is reason that more be paid by the rich then by the pour.
For he that is more endowed with goods is more holden unto god and to the
prince. Answer. It behooves to know how much each one is worth in his goods,
and in his possessions.

The first is wourth 100 francz The second is wourth 400 franc. The third is
wourth 154 franc. The fourth is wourth 1000 franc. The fyfte is wourth 1150
franc. The syxte is wourth 40 franc. The seventh is wourth 440 franc. The eight
is wourth 80 franc. The nynth is wourth 600 franc. The tenth is wourth 360
francz.
Now it behooves you to find the multyplycator and the deuisor. The
multyplycator shall be each one by him self, and so for the first it behooves
you to multyplye by 100, for the second by 400. for the third by 154, and so
must ye do of the other: And for to find the divisor, ye shall set together
all the multiplicatours, as 100, 400, 154 etc. and all that together shall be
the divisor commune, which is 4464 Therefore multyply the collecte, that is to
wit, 244 for each one his valor, and dyuyde by 4464, or by the half that is
2232, and then ye shall write how much each one ought to pay. Example.

The first should pay 5 franc. 9 shyllynges 3 d. and half rest 1464.

The second should pay 12 franc. 17 shyllynges 3 pens, re^^eth 1^92.

The third should pay 8 frances 8 sz. 4 pens rests 660.

The fourth should pay 54 frances 15 shyllynges 2 pens, rests 1248.

The fyfte should pay 62 frances 17 sz. 2 pens rests 96

The syxte should pay 2 frances 3 sz. and half 2 pens and half, rests 1032.

The seventh should pay 24 frances 1 shylling 0 pens, rests 192

The eight should pay 4 frances 7 sz. 5 pens rests 2064.

The nynth should pay 23 frances 15 sz. 10 pens and half, rests 2088

The tenth should pay 27 frances 6 sz. 7 pens rests 624

And they have to dyuyde 2 pens and half of restes. Then when ye have all
dyuyded and write the sum and the restes, ye shall set together all the
restes, and divide them by the deuysor comune, or by the half. And if there be
more or less. the rule is not well made, for the remaynant of all ought to be
dyuyded by the divisor comune. And the prove of this rule is reduccyon. And
mark well this rule for it is right good unto the country where all the goods
be praised by all the towns and castles, as it is in many places of Daulphyne,
and of Prouence

The rule of the mylnes.
One man has three mylnes of whom one gryndeth each day 5 septyers of corn and
the other gryndeth 7 and the third 8. There comes a merchant that will have
gronden one hundredth septyers of corn, I demand how ought the mylner to
dyuyde the corn to the mylnes to the end that each one have as soon done as an
other. Answer. For to know this questyon and rule. ye must find the dyuysor
and the multiplicator, the multyp. shall be each one by him self, and the
deuysor shall be the three multiplycatours set together yt ben 20. Therefore if ye
will know how much corn ought to be laid upon the first mylne, ye must
multyplye the 100 septiers of corn by 5 and deuyde by 20, which shall be 25
septiers, that shall be laid upon the first mylne. And for the second ye shall
multiply 100 by 7 and dyuyde by 20, and there shall be 35 septiers, ye which
ye shall put upon the second mylne, and for the third ye shall multyplye
100 by 8 and dyuyde by 20 and there shall be 40 septiers, which ye shall put
upon the third mylne. And thus may ye do of all other semblable. It may be
made otherwise, set together the sommes that ye three mylnes grynd that is 20,
and by the rule of three ye shall say, if 20 give me an 100, how much shall
give me 5 or 7 or 8. And it is proved by addition. Example. 100

The first shall have 25 septiers. The second 35 septiers. The third 40
septiers, 7, 5, 8, 20 Multiplicatours. Dyuysour.

shall multiply the 1200 crones by 4 for the sone, by 2 for the mother, and by 1
for the daughter. And for to find the dyuisor ye shall set together 1, 2, and
4, which ben 7, therefore dyuyde by 7. Example.

first day one mile, the second day two, the third three, and so encreasynge
after progressyon. Be ye all certain that in some day the one ouertaketh the
other. It is demanded in what day, and how many miles they shall go. Answer.
Double the number of his mylles that goes each day an egall number of miles
And of the number dowble take away one unity, and the remanant shall show you
what day they shall mete either other

Example.
We shall set it that the one goes a day 6 miles, double that and it is 12,
and fro that 12 withdraw one unity, as it is said in the rule, and there
remains 11, that is the number of the day that they shall mete together. And
for to know the number of the miles that they have gone. Multyplye 11 by 6 in
saying 6 times 11 ben 66 miles that they have gone. Thus ye may know it by
the rule of progression continued, 11 is a number not even, be it therefore
multiplied by the greater half that is to wit by 6 in saying 11 times 6 or
6 times 11 ben 66. And also one only number amounte by progressyon, and by
multyplycatio^, whereby it appears that upon the elleuenth day they mete each
other, and have gone 66 miles.

Here follow diverse other proper rules and questyons.
A Lord hyreth a servant, the which he should give every year ^0 nobles and
a gown, and the same servant dwells 7 months with him, and then they
varye in so much that his lord gave him license to go his way. And says, go
thy ways out of my house and take thy gown with the, and then I am nothing in
thy debt. Now I demand what was the gown worth, will ye know that, then
mark how many months 7 is less than a year, that is 5 months less. And
had ye servant tarried so long yet by his master than should he have had the
gown and 10 nobles. Therefore say thus 5 months gives 10 nobles, what
gives 7. Make it after ye rule of three / and it comes 14 nobles.

Of three fellows or young men.
Three fellows play together ye one to win the others money. For the one had
more money than the other. And the first casts, yt the one of them three
leseth just so much money as ye other two had. Than casts the second and
leseth also as much as the other two had Then casts the third and leseth
also just as much as the other two had. And than was the money just divided,
and had each like much. Now I demand how much had each or they began to
play, and how much money that each had when they played. Will ye know that,
then mark how many persons did play, and add 1 to them, as here add 1 to 3
makes 4. So many nobles had ye first. Now dowble 4 comes 8, and subtra 1 from
8 rest 7: so many nobles had ye second. The^ double 7 comes 14, thereof subtra
3 rest 13, so many nobles had the third.

part of a pound to pay for the 63 pounds of saffron. Now will ye know how
many shyllynges that 4/46 part of a li. is. than multyply 4 by 20, for 20 sz
makes a li. comes 80 sz. deuyde them with 46 comes 1 sz, and 4/64 part of a
sz. Now will ye know how many pens that 34/64 part of a shyllynge is, the^
multiply 34 with 12 12 pens makes a sz, comes 408. Dyuyde them with 46 comes
8 pens and 40/46 part of a pen^y. Now will ye know how many farthynges that
^^/4^ part of a penny is, then multypplye 40 with 4, for 4 farthynges makes a
penny, comet 160 farthynges. Now deuyde them with 49, comes 3 farthynges and
22/46 part of a farthynge, Thus done ye shall find that 63 li. of, saffron
cost 41 li. 1 sz. 8 farthynges and 22/46 part of a farthynge.

Item a 165 pounds of alome cost 2 pounds 5 shyllynges 6 pens 9 fa^thynges:
what shall cost 22 pounds of alome. If ye will soil this question, than make
of your pounds shyllynges and add thereto the odd 5 shyllynges: comes 45
sz. Then make of the 45 sz. penes, and add 6 pens, comes 546 pens, than make
of your pens farthynges, and add thereto the 9 odd farthynges, comes 2193
farthynges. Now multyply the farthynges with 22 comes 48246 farthinges. Now
deuyde them with 165 comes 592 and 66/165 part of a farthynge, for so many
farthynges shall cost 22 li. of alome. Now will ye know how many pens that
the forewry ten farthynges make, then dyuyde them with 4, for 4 farthynges make
a penny. Then will ye know how many shyllynges that they make, then divide the
pens with 12, for 12 pens makes a sz. Thus done ye shall find that 22 pound of
alome cost ^ sz. 3. d. 1 farthyng, and it is done.

An other questyon.
A merchant has bought a bag of peper, I say not how heavy, but when he
gives for a pound of peper 12 pens, then remains him yet 37 d. And when that
he gives for a pound of peper 15 pens, then he lacks 44 pens to pay for
the peper. Now I demand how heavy the bag of peper was, and how much money
that the merchant had. For to know this and such other like questyon, ye
shall take and subtra 12 from 15 and there rests 3, which 3 shall be your
deuysor. Then shall ye add 44 and 37 together / and that makes 81. Then must
ye deuyde 81 with 2, and thereof comes 27, so many pound wayeth the bag of
peper. Now will ye know how much money the merchant had, then must ye
multiplye 12 with 27. and add 37 thereto, or multyply 15 with 27 and subtra 44,
comith 361, so many pens had the merchant.

An other questyon.
A Dronkart drynketh a barell of bear in the space of 14 days, and when his
wife drinks with him than they drink it out within 10 days. Now I demand
in what space that his wife should drink that barell of bear alone. For to
soil this questyon and such other like, ye shall first subtra the lee^t
drynker from ye more that is 10 from 14 and there remains 4, and that is your
deuisor. Now say 4 gives 10 what gives 14 Make it after the golden rule, and
ye shall find that she should drink it in 35 days.

Here ends the introduction of awgrym for the pen.
Here begins the introduction for to learn to reken with the counters, with
diverse rules belonging to the same.

X. thousand.

Thousand

One.



FOr as much as there ben many persons that been unlearned, and can not write,
yet nevertheless the craft or science of awgrym and reckoning is needful for
them to know, wherefore I shall hereafter declare and write of this science in
the best and shortest wise that may be possible, how that ye shall order your
self in reckoning and to cast counter.

First ye shall understand that in the craft of awgrym be 9 letters or
fygures that men may lay and write all manner of sommes withal. Therefore first
of all a man must know in this craft or science for to lay 9 counters in
the places of that 9 syfers, for they must lay evermore still for a
remembrance, so that ye may remember your place by them. And ye must lay
them the one right above the other, that is to say, in ye first place every
counter stands for one, and the nethermoste counter is the first place, in
the second place every counter stands for 10 In the third place for a 100.
In ye fourth place for a thousand. In the fyfte place for 10 thousand. In the
syxth place for 100 thousand. In the seventh place for a myllyon. In the
eyghte place for 10 myllyons. In the nynth place for a hondreth myllyons. In
the tenth place for a thousand myllyons, and so forth infinitely. And note
well that every counter that is laid between the lygnes, betokens evermore 5
times more then the counter that lies in the place next vnde him / that is
to say the first counter lyenge alone above the first place betokens 5 the
counter lyenge alone between the second and the third liar and place, stands
fore 50, above the third place 5 honderth, above the fourth 5 thousand above
the fyfte place 50 thousand, above the syxt place 500 thousand, above the
seueth 5 myllyons, above the eight 50 myllyons, above the 9 place 500 myllyons,
above the tenth place five thousand myllyons. But if ye will the more surer
know your places it is necessary for you to mark every place with a mark, as
to lay a counter or some other thing which shall ever lay still and in no wise be
remeued / but ye must take heed if ye lay cou^ters for the mark of your
places, that ye lay them not to nygh the counter that ye must work with all,
lest that ye take the one for the other, but lay them as ye se them marked in
the ensamples following. And when ye have laid marks and know the order of your
places, ye may add, and subtra, multyply and deuyde what nombers ye list, that
is to say, to cast and to abate at your pleasure.

Item when there lie 2 counters between two liars, take him up and lay 1
beside the next liar above them. And when there lie 5 counters beside any liar
take them up and lay 1 in the next space above them.

Of addycyon.
ADdycyon is none other thing but to set together 2 or 3 nombers and to make of
them a total sum, as in the ensample following.

There is a man which owyth 20 li. 18 pound, 100 pound, 50 pound, and 69
pound. Now if ye will know how. much yt al these sommes makes together Then
for the first sum ye must lay two countres beside the seconnde liar, for the
two stand for 20 / that is for the first sum. Now for the second sum
lay 1 counter beside the second liar, for that is 10 / and lay 1 counter
betwyxt the nethermost and the second liar, for that 1 stands for 5 / and
then lay 3 counters beside the nethermost liar / and they all together make 18.
Now for the third some ye shall lay 1 counter beside the third liar / for
that is an 100. For the fourth sum lay 1 counter beside the third and the
second liar, that is 50. Now for the fyfte sum lay 1 counter betwyxte the
third and the second, and 1 beside the second liar, and 1 bewene ye second
and the nedermost, and 4 beside the ne, thermost liar, and that makes together
69 / and in so doing ye shall find that all the forewryten sommes make
together 247 as ye shall se in the figure following And evermore for a general
rule remember your places, for every counter that lies beside the first liar
stands but for 1, in the second place every counter stands fof 10, in ye
third place for 100 as is before rehearsed.

diagram of counters

Will ye prove whither ye have added well or not, than subtra all your sommes
one after an other. And in like wise as ye do with this ensample so ye shall do
with all other of addicion,

Of subraction.
SVbtractio^ is, if ye will withdraw any sum from an other sum, ye must
know two numbers, that is to wit, the number that ye will withdraw, and the
number where fro ye will withdraw. An ensample. There is a man that owes you
9756 pounds, and there upon he has paid you 5989 pounds, Now if ye will
know what there rests then set down your su^me that he ought you, and
thereof withdrw the su^me that he has paid you, and that ye remains is the
some that he does yet owe you, as ye more plainly may se it in the ensamples
hereafter following.

diagram of counters

And when ye have set your death / yt is to say 975^ poun^des under this manner
as a fore showed. Then if ye will know the rest, the^ take thereof that ye have
paid as 5989 pou^des. Now for to do this / ye shall first take up the cou^ter
that lies between the fourth and fyft liar for that is 5000. The^ take up one
of the cou^ters which lies beside the fourth liar, and that is a thousand /
and ye should take away but 900, therefore ye must lay down 1 cou^ter again
beside ye third liar, that is a ho^dreth. The^ take up one of the counters
that lies beside the third liar, which is a hondreth / and ye should take up
but 80, therefore ye must lay 2 counters beside the second liar / that is 20
and 80, that ye have take up makes 100, then take up one of the counters that
lies beside the second liar / yt is 10 / and ye should have take away but 9,
therefore ye must lay one counter beside the nethermost liar, that is 1 and the
9 that ye have subtrahed or take up, makes 10, and there remains 3767 pound
det, and stand thus.

diagram of counters

Will ye prove whyther ye have subtrahed well or not, then add thereto that ye
have paid, and if the sum come then so great as it was before, then is your
subtraction true, else not.

Multiplication.
MVltiplycation is nothing e^les but to multiplye one number by an other, as
thus, to know what is 6 times 9 or 6 times 12 and such like. And in
multiplycation ye must consider two nombers, that is to wit, the number that ye
will multyply, and the number whereby ye will multiply, and ye must work in
multiplycatyon after this manner: First ye shall lay down the lesser number,
which is 6, and this 6 is the number that shall be multyplyed, and the 9 is the
number that ye shall mutiply withal And ye shall lay the number that shall be
multiplied, at the right side of your liars and when ye work your
multiplycation, ye shall lay them at the lift side, as in this ensample here
after following shall more plainly appear.

diagram of counters

First ye must lay down the lesser number, which is 4, as i^ this ensample,
as ye se them laid here on the right hand of the liars. And when that ye have
thus done, ye must take up one counter and lay 9 for it on the other side of
the marks, that is to wit / at the lift side. And after that take up another
cou^ter / and lay also 9 for it / and so forth for every counter that ye take
up ye must lay 9 for it at the other side. And when that ye have so wrought
your work, it will come just to 36, as ye se the counters before laid on the
lift hand of the lygnes.

And if ye will multiplplye by greater numbers as thus / to know what is 24
times 14. First lay 14 on the right hand of your liars or markers, as this
ensample following shows.

place next above your finger / and reke^ every chone of them for 2 which
makes just 6, then 10 and 6 makes 16 / as the figure before showed / when ye
have so done, then take away your finger, and for every one of the 3 counters
that lies in the first place on the right side lay 16 on the lift side / and
then take them of the right side away / and ye shall se that the number shall
just come to 128, as the ensample before showed. And this wise ye must reken
all counters that lies in the spaces if the multplycacyon shall be truly made.

An other ensample
For to know how many grotes be in 4563 nobles. First ye shall set down the
less number, that is the number that ye shall multiylye, as this figure
following plainly here shows,

diagram of counters

Now for to make of these nobles grotes, ye must multyplye them with 20, for
20 grotes makes a noble. Now for to multiply this number / evermore ye must
set down the number that ye will multyplye at the right side at your marks
and set your finger against the mark that ye begin at, for your finger
shall be a remembrance to you for that place where your finger stands is
the first place and damneth all the places underneath him.

Now for to make grotes of ^hese 4563 nobles. First ye shall set your finger
against the fourth liar, and take up one of the four counters that lies
against the said fourth liar, and lay two counters beside the nerte liar above
that, where your finger stands, for that is the second place from your
finger, and the two counters so laid stands for 20 that is one noble, and
like as ye have done with this one counter, so shall ye do with the other 3
following. Then take up the counter that lies between the third and the fourth
liar and lay two counters in the next space above that, and that is also 20 or
else ye may take it up and lay one counter beside the second liar, for the
place where your finger stands and that is also 20. Tken take up the counter
that lies betwyxt the second and the third liar, and lay 2 in the next
space above that / then take up the counter that lies beside the second liar,
and lay two counters beside the next liar above that same. Then set your finger
against the first liar, and take up one of the 3 counters and lay 2 counters
for it beside the next liar above that, and as ye have done with that, so must
ye do with the othertwo, and then ye shall find that 4563 nobles makes 91290
grotes, and stands thus as the ensample hereafter shows. And as ye have
done with these forewyten ensample of multyplcation, so shall ye do with all
other of multiplycacyon.

diagram of counters

Will ye know or prove whither ye have multyplied well or not, then divide the
grotes, that is 91260 by 20, and if the sum come to stand as it was before,
then ye have multyplyed well. And thus always ye may make your prove upon all
manner of multyplycatours.

Of dyuysyon.
DYuysyon is to deuyde a sum thorough an other sum: and in this dyuysyon
must beknowen two nombers, that is the nober that ye will deuyde, and the nober
whereby ye will deuyde it, as to know how many times ye may have a small number
out of a great as by ensample, if ye will deuyde 336, by 14 as in this ensample
hereafter. First lay 336 on the right hand of your liars, and then set your
finger at ye highest place where any cou^ter lies, for as I showed you before,
ye damneth all the other places beneth, so ye then there as your finger is, is
the first place. And then look ye may take 14 from that place, which ye can
not do, for every counter stands but for one, because your finger is there,
therefore ye must remove your finger to the next place benethe where the other
3 counters lie / and then look if ye may take 14 from that place which ye
may do right well / for these 3 counters at your finger stands but for, 3
and the other 3 counters above stands for 30, and then se how many times 14
ye may have out of 33 and so many counters ye must lay on the other side just
against your finger / that is to say, ye may have 28 out of 33, that is two
times 14 out of 33 / and therefore ye must take up 28 and lay 2 counters on the

diagram of counters

other side against your finger, and tha^ ye can have 14 no more, than ye
must remeue your finger to the next place beneth, and then reke^ that place at
your finger to be the first place, as ye did before: and then look how many
times ye may have 14 from that place, which ye can not, for that counter at
your finger stands but for 1, and the other in ye space above stands but
for 10 which is in all but 11, therefore ye must remove your finger to the
next place beneth / and then ye shall se that that number is 56 out of the
which ye may well take out 4 times 14 which makes just 56 therefore ye must
take up 56 and lay 4 counters on the other side against your finger / and then
take away your finger, and ye shall se that that number that ye have laid on
the lift side of your marks comes just to 24 as the ensample before showed,
and then ye have your question soyled; for if ye deuyde 336 by 14 it comes
just to 24 for 24 times 14 makes just 336, as I have showed you before in the
rule of multyplycation. And likewise as ye have divided this number, ye may do
with all other no^bers. And if ye will prove whither ye have well divided or
not, take the number that comes of your diuisyon, and multyplye it with the
small number that is your deuysor, and add that remains thereto if there be
any, and than it will come just to the great number that was the number to be
divided. And likewise if ye will prone whyther ye have truly multyplyed or no,
take ye great number that comes of your multiplycatio^, and deuyde him by the
number that is to be multyplyed, and it will come just to the third number that
was your multyplyer,

diagram of counters

if ye desire to know how many grotes ben in 79992 pens. First ye shall set
down your pens as ye se in this figure before, and ye shall deuyde them with 4
for 4 d makes a grote. Now to the operacyon thereof, when that ye have set
down your pens, as the figure before showed / than set your finger at the
highest counter. and se if ye may have 4 from that place / which of a surety ye
can not, for there lies but one, and it stands but for one, by cause you
finger stands there therefore ye shall remeue your finger and set it against
the fyfte liar, and se if ye may take away 4 the which ye may do, for there
lies 7. Now your finger stands against the fyfte liar, therefore ye shall
take up the counter that lies in the next space above your finger, for that
counter is 5, and ye should take up but 4 therefore ye shall take it up and lie
it beside the fyfte liar of the right side, and lay 1 on the lift side also
beside the fyfte liar, then se if ye can have 4 any more from ye place yt which
ye can not, therefore remeue your finger and set it against ye fourth lier, and
then se how many times 4, ye may have out of 39 ye may have 9 times 4, and for
this 9 times 4 ye shall lay 1 counter in the space between the fourth and fyfte
liars, and 4 beside the fourth liar, and that make 9 And as ye have done with
these so shall ye do with all other following, and when ye have fynished your
work ye shall find ye 79992 pens make 19908 gretes as ye may se plainly here
in this figure.

diagram of counters

The prove.
If ye will prove whyther ye have divided well or not, then multyply the grotes
with 4, for 4 pens makes a grote, and if the some come to stand as it did
before then ye have divided well.

Ite^ when ye deuyde any sum with d. if there remains any thing it is pens
And if ye deuyde by shyllynges, if there remains any thing it is shyllynges.
And as ye have done with these forewryten examples so may ye do with all other.

The golden rule.
Regula aurea is called ye golden rule for like as gold passes all other
metal so this rule passes all other rules in awgrym. And to the operacyon of
this rule must always be noted three things or three nombers, of the which
two of them must be like of names and of kind, that is to wit, the first
and the third number, and always ye shall multyply the second number with the
third, and that that comes of the multiplycation is the number to be to
divided by the first number that is general dyuysor / and the quocient of the
dyuysor, shows a number of solucyon of name and kind of the mydle no^bers,
as in these ensamples following shall appear.

If a man byeth 40 eggs for 20 pens how many for 12 pens, if ye will soil
this question, ye must mutyplye the second and the third number together /
and the producte or the sum that comes of that multyplycation, ye shall
dyuyde by ye first number, like as here is showed in this ensample, when ye
bye 40 eggs for 20 pens. what shall one pay for 12 eggs ye shall multyply 20
with 12, comes 240, the which ye shall deuyde with 40 comes 6 pens, and so
much shall ye pay for the 12 eggs. And thus ye may do with all other such
questyons.

An other qustyon.
Ite^ a 100 apples cost 12 pens, what shall one pay for 87, ye shall multyply
12, with 87, comes ^044, the which ye shall divide with a 100 comes 10 pens
44/10 part of a d. for the 87 appels. Will ye know how many farthynges that
the 44 hondreth part of a penny is wdrth, then multiply 44 with as many
farthynges as a penny is worth, that is 4 comes 176 the which ye shall deuyde
with 100 comes 1 farthynge and 67/100 part of a farthinge.

Item 165 pound of wax cost 2 li. 5. sz. 6. d. 9 mytes. what shall cost 22
l. For to soil this question and such other lyker, first ye must make of
pounds sz, and add thereto the odd 5 sz. the which stand in this question,
and the come together to 45 sz. then make of the sz. pens, and add thereto the
odd 6 pens that stands in ye questyon comes 546 d. than make of the pens
mytes, and 24 mytes is a penny, and thereto add the odd 9 mytes, that stands
in the question comes together to 23113 mytes, and that is the total som^e
of all the li. sz. d, and mytes together Now make it after the rule and say
165 pound of wax cost 13113 mytes, what shall cost ^2 pound, first
multiplye the myldelmost and ye last together, that is ye shall multyplye the
mytes with the last, that is with 22, and it shall come to 388486, deuyde them
with 165 and it shall come to 1748 mytes and 6/165 part of a myte, so many
mytes shall the 22 pound of wax cost. Now will ye know how many pens that
the forewryte^ mytes make: then deuyde them with 24, for 24 mytes makes 2 penny
Then will ye know how many sz. that the pens make, then deuyde them with 12,
for 12 d. makes a sz. And thus doing ye shall find that the 22 li. of wax shall
cost 6 sz. 20 mytes and 66/165 patt of 1 myte and it is done.

Item when there stands 1 in the first place, As 1 goos cost 3 d. what shall
cost 28. ye shall multyply the myddels^e with the last in saying 3 times 28 is
84 so many pe^s cost 28 gese, and it is fynyshed.

Item in the contrary as when that 1 comes in the latter end, as here in this
ensample 20 capons cost 23 pens / what shall cost 1 capon. For to soil this
question ye shall divide ye myddelmost with the first that is 23 with 20 comes
1 d. and 1/20 part of a penny, that is 0 mytes and part of 1 myte for 1 capon,

Item 17 else and cost 14 nobles and 1/ part of a noble, what shall cost 32
else and 2/^ part. For to soil this questyo^ and such like / first ye must
break the first and last broken together crossewyse in saying 1 times 4 is 4,
set the 4 by 17 else The^ say 3 times 2 is 6 / set ye 6 by the 22 else. Then
multyplye both ye nombers of your fractyons together / in saying 4 times 2 is
8 the which ye shall set under 4 and 6 / then it stands thus: as in the rule
of three / if 17 else and 4/8 part of an elle cost 14 nobles and part of a
noble / what shall cost 32 else and ^/^ part of an elle. First mulyply the
first hole number with the nethermost of his broken that is 17 with 8 comes
136 and thereto ye shall add yt 4 that stands above 8 comeeh 140, the which
ye shall multyply with the 3 that stands under the second broken com^th 430
that is your deuysor, then multiply 14 with the 3 that stands under 1 and
add that 1 thereto comes 43 that is your multiplicatour, then multyply 32 with
the nethermost figure of the broken, that is with 8 and add thereto the same 6
that stands above the same 8 comes 262. Now set it in the rule of three in
saying 420 else cost 43 nobles, what shall cost 262, multiply the second with
the third and then deuyde that that comes of that multiplycation with the
first, and ye shall find that the 32 else of cloth cost 26 nobbles 16 d. 34
mytes and 150/420 part of a myte.

Item when that there stands at the begynnyge a hole number with a broken and
in the second and third place no broken, as here. 36 else and 1/1 cost ^
li. what shall cost 16 else. For to soil this question, ye must multyply the
first hole number with the vndermoste figure of his broken, that is 36 with 2,
and add the 1 thereto that stands aboueth 2 coming 73, and that is your
deuysor, then multiplye 8 li. also with the vndermoste figure of the broken,
that is to with with 2, and it comes to 16, then multyplye 16 with 16 comes
to 259 the which ye shall deuyde with 37, and it will show you that there
shall be to pay for the foresaid clothe 3 pound 10 shyllynges 1 penny 17
mytes, and 2^/73 part of a myte.

Item when there stands in the first nor in the second no broken number, but
in the latter end a hole number with a broken, as here 1^ ounces of grain
cost 14 sz. what for 9 ounces of grain and one third. For to know this ye
shall multiplye the first 14 with 3 that is your deuysor, then multiplye 9 with
3 and add that 1 thereto ye stands above 3 comes 28, then set it thus 4^
gives 14 what gives 18, make if forth after the rule and ye shall find that
there is to pay 9 shyllynges 4 pens for the 9 ounces of grain and one third
part.

Item when that ye find neythere at the beginnynge nor at the latter end no
b^oken number, but in the mids a hole with a broken as here. A man bought 48
sheep for 64 crones and ^/4 what shall cost 18 sheep, For to soil this
questyon ye must multyplye 48 with 4 comes 192 that is your deuysor, then
multyplye 64 with 4, and add thereto the 2 that standdeth above 4, comes 258,
the which ye shall multyplye with 18 comes 494^ the which ye shall dyuynde
with 192. And thus ye shall find that ye must pay for the 16 sheep 24 crones
4 stuners and 36 mytes

Item when ye find no broken at the beginning but in the second and third
one hole with a broken. As 7 else for 6 pound what shall cost 16 else and
^/^ For to soil this question ye must multyplye the two undermost borken
nombers together, in saying 3 times 4 is 12, the which ye shall multiplye
with 7 comes 84 that is the dyuysor. The^ multyply each with his broken comes
25 and 46 ye which ye shall multiplye one with the other, comes 1225, the
which ye shall deu^^e with 84, and the solucyon shall be to pay 14 li 12 sz. 18
d.

when that ye find at the beginning and the mids a hole with a broken, and
at the latter end standing a hole without a broken as 9 else and ^/4 for 5
pound what shall cost 15 else multiplye 9 with 4 and add thereto 3 comes 59,
the which ye shall multiplye with 8 comes 312, that is your deuysor then
multyply 5 with 8 and add thereto the 5 that stands above 8 comes 45 the
which ye shall multyply with 4 that stands under ye first broken, comes
180. Now set it in the rule of three in saying 312 gyues 180 what gives 15,
make i^ after the rule and it comes 8 li. 13 sz. 22 mites and 1^/59 of a myte.

The rule of company.
There be 3 merchants or companyons the which lay together their money in
marchaundyse, and each to win after his inlayenge, whereof he first laid in
170 crones. The second 60 crones The third 40 crones and therewith they have
won 50 crones beside al vncost Now I demand how much that each shall have
after his inlayeng. Now for to soil this question and all such other rules of
company, ye must make of their money that they have laid in a total sum
comes 250 / now say 250 gives 50 what gives 150 make it after the rule of
there and it comes to the first man 30 crones winning. Now for know what
the second has won, ye shall say 250 gives 50 what gives 60 make it
after the rule, and ye shall find that the second has won 12 crones, will
ye know what the third has, then say 250 gives 50 what gives 40 make it
after the rule, and ye shall find that the third has won 8 crones. And
thus shall ye do with all other rules of company.

The rule of company with time.
Three fellows does marchaundyse together, whereof the first lays in 50 crones
for 4 months. The second 80 crones for 2 months. The third 100 crones for
5 months, and withal this money they have won 6 crones beside all vncost
paid. Now I demand what each has won with his money, for to know this ye
must mulyplye each man's money with his time, that is for the first 50 with
4 comes 200, set the as though he has laid in so much, for the second
multyply 80 with 2 comes 160 set it also as though he had laid in so much,
for the third multyplye 10^ with 5 comes 500, set that also as though he had
laid in so much. Now add the 3 nombers togythere and then make it after the
rule of company and then shall ye find what each has won with his money.

The rule of baterynge.
Two marchaunte men will change their wares together and the one has a fine
blake clothe the which is 43 else long, and he will give the elle no less
than 18 pens. The other merchant has peper, and he will sell the pound no
less than 13 d. Now I demand how many pound of peper the first merchant
shall have for his 43 else of clothe. For to soil this question ye shall say
13 gives 43 what gives 18, make it after the rule of 3 and ye shall find
that the first shall have for his clothe 59 pound of peper 8 ounces 12
engelsche and 4/13 part of an englysche

Of a watte.
A wat ronneth in the fylde and ouerronneth in one mynute / there be 60 in an
hour / 12 rods of ground. And a grahounde being her enemy / follows her
and ouerronneth in one mynute 15 rods of ground. But or the grahonde began
to run the hare had run 200 rods of land. Now is to be demanded in how
many minutes and how many rods of land was the hare taken. For to soil this
question and such like, ye shall subtra the less ronnynge out of the more that
is 12 out of 15, and there remains 3 and therewith ye shall deuyde the space
that the hare has run before or the grahounde began to run / that is 200
rods, And in so doing ye shall find that the grahounde ouertoke the hare in
the 66 mynutes and parts of a mynute that is one hour and 6 mynues and of a
mynute, will ye know how many rods that the grahonde did run or that he
took the hare / then multiply 66 and 2/^ with 15 comes 3000/^3 the which ye
shall deuyde with 3 comes 1000 hole so many rods did the hounde run or that
he took the hare.

The rule of two fellows.
Two fellows went together out of a town, and the one goes every day 12
mile, and the other goethe the first day but 1 mile, and the second day 2
miles the thryde day 3 miles / and so forth euere day one mile more. Now I
demand in how many days / and how many mile went he or that he ouertoke his
fellow. For to soil this questyon, ye shall double the miles of him that went
every day like much, that is 12 and 2 times 12 is 24, thereof ye shall subra
the one mile that the other goes the first day, and there rests 23, upon
the same day was the first man overtaken of his companyon? will ye know in
how many mile, then multiply 23 with 12 comes 276 for so many miles went he
or he ouertoke him.

A man has a golden crown of 34 stuuers, and a phylyppus gulden of 15
stuuers, and a ducate of 28 stuuers, and with this money he goes to the
chaunger and will have for it negenmannekens crowns of 9 mites, and of 3 mytes
and of 2 mites and half mytes. Now I demand how much that he shall receive
of each for the foresaid gold and receive of each like much. For to soil
this question and such like then make of all the great money that he will
change mytes, for that is the least coin that he will have / and comes 9072
mytes, then look how many mytes that all the small pens be worth that he will
have, that is 25. Now deuyde the great sum of the mytes, that is to wit,
9072 with 25 and ye shall find that he must have of each 362 and 1^/25 and
it is done,

Of four carpenters.
Four carpentes will make a house whereof the first takes upon him to make it
him self alone in a year. The second will make it in two years, The third will
make it in 3 years. And the fourth in 4 years / Now I demand if all these 4
wrought upon that house in what space would they 4 make that house. will ye
know that, then say the first would make it in one year that were 12 times in
12 year The second in 2 year, that were 6 times in 12 year. The third in three
year that were 4 times in 12 year. And the fourth in four year yt were three
times in 12 year. Now sum them all together that is 12, 6, 4, 3, comes 25,
therewith deuyde 12 comes 12/25 prat of a year Now if ye will know how many
days that it is, then multyplye 12 wthy 365 for so many days be in a year /
and that that comes of that multyplycacyon deuyde it by 25 comes 175 days
and 5/25 part of a day.

The rule of false posytyons, by the which all manner of difficult and hard
questions may easelye be dyssoluyd and first of one salfe posytion.
NOw shall ye know how by false posytio^s or conjectures one or two ye shall
find out the very trewthe of that the which ye seake fore, and first ye shall
understand how to find the truth of a question proposed by one conjecture or
posytyon.

When that any question is put furthe unto you, too be assoylyd, of the which
one part is knowyn and the other vnknowyn. Answer to that question by and by,
with your self at all adventure, and then consider with your self whether ye
have made right answer or no, if not, look what proportion is between your
conjecture and that that folowyth of your conjecture and the same proportion is
between the thing known and that ye partaynyth unto ye self thing being yet
unknown. As by example ye shall more plainly perceive,

A certain way farynge man coming by the way, found so many crowns. that
the second, the third, and the fourth part of them addyd together made 50, I
demand what sum he found. To make answer to this question by one
posycyon, ymagyne some sum that has these parts in it, that is to say: a
second a third, and a fourth part, and be it 12, whose second part or half
is 6, third part 4, the fourth part 3, which all addyd together 643, make
13. but the sum that he found, the second, third, and the fourth of it made
50. wherefore 12 is not the some he found, therefore this position is false / and
yet by this false shall ye come to the light of treweth, by the help of the
rule of three. For look what proporcyon is between the second, the third, and
the fourth part of 12 addyd together, the which makes 13, and 12 whose
parts therbe, the same proporcyon is between 50 which is the second, the
third, and the fourth part addyd together of the number unknown, and the
same unknown number it self. Then say thus with thy self: if 13 which
contains the foresaid parts in them, come of 12 of whom come 50, then set
them thus 13, 12, 50, then by the rule of three multyplye 50 by 12, and thereof
comes 600 dyuyde the same by the first number 13 and in the quotient thou
shall find 46 2/13 the which was ye sum of the corwnes the which the man
found: of the which sum the half part is 23 1/13 the third part is 15 1/1,
the fourth part 11 7/1^ the which parts addyd together make just 50. Thus
thou see how that by one false posicion or conjecture with the help of the
rule of three, this question is soon dissoluyd.

An other questyon.
Find me a number in the which 5 is that is to say, two third parts of him
Answer. ymagyne any number ye list 3 that has thyrdes in it, as be it 6, then
look what is the third part of 6, that is 2. then two of this third parts
of 6 makyth 4 wherefore this posicyon is false, yet by this false posicyon with
the help of the rule of three, thou shall find out ye truth, after this
manner. If 4 be the part of 6 to whom is 5 parts search by the rule of three,
thou shall find it 5

An other question.
What number is that in the which after that the third, the fourth, and the
fyfte part be deductyd out of it, there shall yet remain 24? Answer. ymagen
any number that has a third, a fourth, and a fyfte in him. As for example:
say it is 60, then subtrahe out of him his third, his fourth and his fyfte
part: and thou shall find remain but 13. Lo how much thou have myssed thou
should have found such a number, in the which after the foresaid parts
were subtrahyd should remain 24 and here remains but 13, yet prove by the
rule of three, and thou shall find the true numbe. If 13 remain after the
substraccyo^ of the aforesaid parts is 60 what number is that out of the
which after like substraccyo^ of his third, fourth, and fyfth, part shall
remain 24 prove by the rule and thou shall find it 110 ^/1^ whose third part
is 36 12/13 the fourth 27 10/1^ ye fyfte 22 which all added together make 86
20/^^ the which deductyd out of 110 10/13 shall remain 24. These and diverse
other questions before rehersyd by the same craft one false posycyon may
soon be assoyled. Now will I show you how to dyssolue all manner of questions
how dyffyculte so ever they be by two false posycyons, For by one false
posycyon ye shall (...) answer to all manner of questions, but two false
posions, what ever questyon it be / it may soon have solucyon.

How to answer by two false posycyons.
INnumerable questyons do chance in numbres, the which though they can not be
dyssoluyd by one posycion or conjecture yet shall it not mysse but be assoyled
by two posicions: in the which manner ye must dilyge^tlye note how far above
ye truth or under both posycyo^s do fall: For by the obseruacyon of.ii.
co^iectures how nere they be to the treuthe, and the dyfference of the errors
which ensue of the posycyons, the verite comes to light which may be
done.iii. ways: one way by the rule of both more or both less. Another
way by the rule of the one more and the other less

when both posycions be more then the veryte or both less, then subduce the
less error out of the more error, and that that remains shall be the
diuysor: then multyplye the first error by the second posycion, and the
latter error by the first posycion, and then this.ii. numbers being
multyplyed, deduct the less out of the more, and that that remayneh divide it
by the foresaid divisor, and the quocient shall show the verite. Example Three
merchants divided a 100 crowns so that the second should have 3 crowns
more then the first, and the third 4 mo the^ the second: I demand now how
many crowns each of them received?

Answer. First make saint Androwes cross, as ye se hereafter, then
conjecture what ye list, as for example, Say the first had 33, and then must
the second have 36, and the third merchant 40, which sum gathered together
makes 109 but ye had but 100 to dyuyde, wherefore ye have myssed, and your
posycio^ redowndyth to more then the very sum by 9, which came of your first
posycion 33 wherefore set the first posycion 33 at the upper end of the cross
on the left side of the cosse, and the error which has ensued of that at the
foot of the cross on the same side, as ye se in the example. And for because
that this conjecture came to more then the truth, therefore set this letter M.
in the space between the upper end of ye cross and the nether. And for as
much as in this first conjecture ye have erred thus much, coniecte again and
spupose that the first merchant had 31 then must the second have 34, the
third 38, all these collecte make 103, so that now ye have erred again, your
posycion being to much / so that your error is 3, and for because that this
second posycio^ is more then the veryte as the first was, set the posycio^ 32
at the upper end of the cross on the right side, and the error 3 the foot
of the cross on the same side, and put this letter M. between the space to
sygnyfey more. Both these pasycion then be more then the verite, wherefore
according to the rule first subduce the less error 3 at the foot of the
right side of the cross from the greater error at the foot of ye left side
of the same cross, remains ^ to be set in the space between both ye feet as
ye se: which shall be the dyuysor. Then according to ye rule, multiplye the
first posycyon which is 33 by the error of ye second posycyo^ which is 3,
and thereof comes 99, then the second posicio^ 31 by ye error 9 of the first
posycion, and thereof comes 279, then deducte the less sum 99 out of this
more sum 279, remains 180, dyuyde this sum by the dyfference of the
errors which is 6, and the quocyent shall be 30 which is the true posycyon:
For the first man having 30, the second must have 33, and third 37, which
all set together, make just 100. Thus wonderful craftly by these.ii. false
posycyons ye true and just posycyo^ is brought to light.

The example.
^

An example when both posycyons come to less then the veryte.
WHen both posycyons come to less then is the veryte, the which is all one
matter with the other, as ye shall perceive by the same example again. As
suppose ye had couiected that the first had receued 27, the^ most the second
receive 30, and the third 34, which addyd together make 91 which is less by
^ then the sum 100, the which should be divided among them. Set then this
first false posycion 27 at the upper end of the cross on the left side, and
the error ensuynge of that at the foot of the same cross on the same side.
And for because ye this posicyon come to less then the verite therefore set
this letter L. for less, in the space between the posicion and ye error, as
ye se in the example folowinge. Then coniecte again and suppose that the first
marchaunte had received 29 then by that rekennynge the second should receive
3^ the third 36, which all set together make 97, so that yet this posycion
comes not to the veryte 100, but lacks 3 of it, wherefore set this posycio^
29 at the vppar end of the cross at the right side, and this error 3 at the
foot of the cross, and in the space between the posycion and the error set
this letter L, for less. Now for so much as both these posicyons be less
then the veryte, work as ye did before, according to the rule, subduce the
less error 3 out of the greater error 9, remains 6 for the dyuisor to be
set in the space between the two errors. The^ multiplye the first posycion 27
by the second error 2 comes 81, then the second conjecture 29 by the first
error 9 comes 261 then deducte 81 out of 261 remains 180 which diuyded by
6 the diuysor before said, the quotient shall be 30 which is the just and very
conjecture, the which ye should have coniected. Thus ye have had sufficient
example of this first rule of both more, and both less.

Here after folweth the example of both less.
^

Here follows the rule of one more, and the other less.
WHen the one posycyon amounts to more then the veryte, and the other less
then the veryte, then add the errors together and that addyd number shall be
the diuysor. Then multyplye the first posycyon by the second error, and the
second posyon by the first error, and that that comes of both these
multyplycatours add them together also, then diuyde this addyd number by the
addyd errors the dyuysor aforesaid, and the quocyent shows the true posycion.

The example,
we will take the first case again, and suppose that the first marchaunts
have received 32 crowns, then must the second receue 35, and the third 39,
which all addyd together make 106. wherefore that posycion is false and to much
bye set the posycion 32 at the upper end of the cross / and the error 6 at
the nether end of the cross in the space between, ye shall set this letter M,
for more. And for by case that this posycion has excedeth the veryte, couiecte
again less, and suppose that the first has received 29, then must the
second receive 32, the third 36 all addyd together makes 97, which is less
then the veryte by 3, wherefore set this false posycion 29 at the vppar end of
the right side of the cross, and the error 3 at the nether foot of the
cross, in ye space between set this leter L, for less. Of this two false
posicyons the one is more then the truth the other is less, wherefore
according to the rule add both ye errors 6 and 3 together, that makes 9 for
the divisor: then multyplye the first posycio^ 32 by the second error 3,
which makes ^6. and the second posycyon 19 by the first error 6, which
makes 174, and that that en^ueth of both these multyplycations add it
together, and it makes 270 diuyde this addyd number by the addyd errors,
which was 9, and the quocyent shall be 30 which is the true posycyon as ye may
prove.

The example.

Thus may ye dissolve all other manner of questyons, which have been set before
in this book, without great pain or study,
