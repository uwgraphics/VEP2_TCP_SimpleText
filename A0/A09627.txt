Unto his right entyerly beloved sister in christ Ioyeuce Leygh Thomas more
gretyng in our lord.
HIt is and of long time has been my well beloved sister a custom in the
beginning of ye new year friends to send between presents or gifts / as
the witnesses of their love and frendeshyp and also sygnyfyenge that they
desire each to other that year a good contynuance and prosperous end of that
lucky bygynnynge. But communely all those presents that are used customably
all in this manner between friends to be sent: be such things as pertayne
only unto the body either to be fed or to be cledde or some otherwise delyted:
by which hit seems that their frendshyp is but flesshely and stretches in
manner to the body only. But for asmoche as the love and amyte of christen
folk should be rather goosty frendshyp then bodily: sith yt all faithful
people are rather spyrituall then carnal. For as ^hapostle seyth we be not now
in flesh but in spyryte if christ abide in us. I therefore mine hertly
beloved sister in good luck of this new year have sent you such a present as
may bear wytnes of my tender love and zele to the happy contynuaunce and
gracious encreace of virtue in your soul: and where as the gifts of other
folk declare y^ they wyssheth their frend^s to be worldly fortunate mine
testyfyeth y^ I desire to have you godly prosperous. These works more
profitable then large were made i^ laten by one John^ picus earl of mira^dula a
lordshyp in Italy of whose conning and ^tue ^e need here nothing to speak for
asmoche as here after we peruse the course of his hole life rather after our
little power slenderly then after his merits suffycie^tly. The works are such
that truly good sister I suppose of the quantyte there comes none in your
hand more profitable: neither to thachyuynge of temperaunce in prosperity /
nor to ye purchasing of patience in aduersite / nor to the dyspysynge of
worldly vanyte / nor to the desiring of heavenly felycyte / which works I
would require you gladly to receive: ne were hit yt they b^suche that for the
goodly matter (how so ever they b^tra^slated) may delight and please any person
that has any mean desire and love to god. And that your self is such one
as for your virtue and fervent zele to god can not but ioyously receive any
thing that meanly sowneth either to the reproach of vice commendacyon of
virtue or honor and laud of god who preserve you:

The life of John^ Picus Earl of Mirandula.
Johan Picus of the faders side descended of the worthy lynage of themperoure
Constantyne by a neuew of the said Emperor called Picus by whom all the
Auncestres of this John^ Picus undoubtedly bear that name. But we shall let his
auncestres pass to whom (though they were right excellent) he gave again as
much honor as he received. And we shall speak of him self rehersynge in part
his learning and his virtue. For these be the things which may account for
our own / of which every man is more proprely to be co^me^ded then of ye
noblenes of his auncestres: whose honor makes us not honorable. For either
they were them self virtuous or not: if not / then had they none honor them
self had they never so great possessions: for honor is the reward of
virtue. And how may they claim the reward yt proprely longs to virtue: if
they lak the virtue that ye reward longs to. Then if them self had none
honor: how might they leave to their heirs y^ thing which they had not them
self / on y^ other side if they be virtuous and so consequently honorable /
yet may they not leave their honor to us as enheretaunce: no more then the
virtue that them self were honorable for. For never the more noble be we for
their noblenes: if our self lak those things for which they were noble. But
rather the more worshipful that our auncestres were / the more vile and
shamfull be we: if we declyne from ye steps of their worshypfull living: y^
clear beauty of whose virtue makith the dark spotte of our vice the more
euydently to appear and to be ye more marked. But Picus of whom we speak was
him self so honorable / for ye great plentuouse habundau^ce of all such
virtues / ye possessyon whereof very honor follows (as a shadow folowith a
body) y^ he was to all them y^ aspyre to honor a very spectacle in whose
co^dycyons as in a clear pullished myrrour they might behold in what points
very honor stondeth: whose merueylous conning and excellent virtue though my
rude learning be far unable suffyciently to express: yet for as much as if
no man should do hit but he yt might sufficiently do hit: no man should do hit
/ and better it were to be vnsufficie^tly done then utterly undone. I shall
therefore as I can brefely rehearse you his hole life: at the leest wise to give
some other man here after (yt can do hit better) occasyon to take hit in hand
when hit shall happily grieve him to se the life of such an excellent connyng
man so far vnkonnyngly written

Of his parents and time of his birth.
IN ye year of our lord god.M.CCCC.lxiij. Pius the second being than the
general vycare of christ in his church: and Frederyk the third of y^ name
rulynge the empire this noble man was borne the last child of his mother Iulya
/ a woman comen of a noble stok / his father hight John^ frauncise a lord of
great honor and auctorite.

Of the wondre that appeared before his birth.
A Merueylouse sight was there seen before his birth / there appeared a fyery
garlande standing over ye chaumbre of his mother while she traveled and
suddenly vanysshed a way: which appare^ce was peradventure a token that he
which should y^ hour in the company of mortal men be borne: in the
perfeccion of understanding should be like y^ perfyte figure of that round
cyrcle of garlande and that his excellent name should round about the cyrcle
of this hole world be mangnyfyed whose mind should always as the fire aspyre
upward to heavenly thing. And whose fyry eloquence should with an ardent heart in
time to come whorship and praise almighty god with all his strength. And as y^
flame suddenly vanisshyd so should this fire sone from ye eyes of mortal people
be hid we have oftyntymes red that such unknown and strange tokens has
gone before of follows the natyuytese excellent wise and virtuous men
departing (as hit were and by gods commandment) seuerynge the cradyls of
such special children fro ye company of other of the comune sort. And
showing yt they be borne to the accheuynge of some great thing. But to pass
over other. The great saint ambrose: a swarm of bees flewe about his mouth in
his cradle and some entered in to his mouth and after yt yssuynge out again
and fleing up on high hydynge them self among the clouds escaped both y^
sight of his father and of all them that were present / which pronostycacyon
one Paulinus making much of: expowned it to signyfye to us the sweet honey
combs of his plesaunt writing: which should show out the celestial gifts
of god and should lift up the mind of men from earth in to heaven.

Of his person.
HE was of feture and shappe semely and beauteous / of stature goodly and
high: of flesh tender and soft / his vysage lovely and fair / his color
white entermengled with comely ruddes / his eyes gray and quick of look / his
teth white and even / his here yelowe and not to piked.

Of his setting forth to scole and study in humanyte.
UNder ye rule and governance of his mother he was set to masters and to
learning: where with so ardent mind he labored the studyes of humanite: ye
within short while he was (and not without a cause) accounted among the chyef
Orators and Poets of that time in learning meruaylously swyfte and of so ready
a wit / that y^ versis which he herd ones red: he would again both forward
and bakwarde to the great wonder of the herers rehearse / and over that would
hold hit in sure remembrance which in other folks wont comenly to happen
contrary. For they yt are swyfte in taking be oftentimes slow in remembrynge /
and they yt with more labor and dyffyculte receive hit: more fast and suerely
hold hit.

Of his study in Canone.
IN the fouretene year of his age by the commandment of his mother (which
longed vere sore to have him priest) he departed to Bononye to study in ye
laws of the church / which when he had two year tasted / perceiving that
the faculte leyned to nothing but only merry tradicions and ordinances: his
mind fill from hit / yet lost he not his time therein for in that two year yet
being a child he co^pyled a breuyary or a sum upon all the decretalles in
which as brefly as possible was he comprysed theffecte of all ye hole great
volume and made a book no scle^der thing to right co^nyng and perfyte doctors.

Of his study in phylosophye and deuynyte.
AFter this as a desyrours enserchour of the secrets of nature he left these
commyn trodden paths and gave him sefe hole to speculation and philosophy as
well humane as deuyne. For the purchasing whereof (afte the manner of Plato and
Appollonius) he scrupulously sought out / all the famous doctors of his time.
visytynge studeously all the vnyuersytes and scoles not only through Italy but
also through france. And so infatigable labor gave he to those studies: that
yet a child and berdles he was both reputed and was in deed both a perfyte
philosophre and a perfyte deuyne.

Of his mind and vayngloryouse dispicious of Rome.
NOw had he ben.vij. year conuersaunt in these studies when full of pride and
desirous of glory and man's praise (for yet was he not kendled in ye love of
god) he went to rome and there (coveting to make a show of his co^nynge: and
little consideringe how great envy he should reyse against him self).ix.C.
questions he purposed / of diverse and sundry matters. as well in logike and
philosophye as dyuynyte / with great study piked and sought out as well of the
laten auctours as the greeks. And partly set out of the secret misteryes of
the hebrews / caldeyes / and arabics. And many things drawn out of y^ old
obscure philosophye of Pythagoras / trimegistus / and orpheus / and many other
things strange: and to all folk (except right few special excellent men)
before that day: not unknown only: but also vnherde / of all which
questions in open places (yt they might be to all people ye better known) he
fastened and set up / offering also him self to bear the costs of all such
as would come hither out of far countrees to dyspute / but thorughe ye envy
of his malicyous enemies (which envy like ye fire ever draws to ye highest)
he could never bring about to have a day to his dyspicions appointed. For
this cause he tarried at Rome an hole year in all which time his enuyours never
durst openly with open dispicyons atempt him but rather with craft and
sleyght and as it were with pryuey trenches enforced to under mine him for none
other cause but for malice and for they were (as many men thought) corrupt
with a pestylent envy.

This envy as men demed was specyaly raised against him for this cause that
where there were many which had many years: some for glory: some for couetyse:
given them self to learning: they thought that hit should happily deface their
fame and minysshe thopynyon of their co^nynge if so young a man plenteouse of
substance and great doctrine: durst in the chyefe cite of the world make a
proof of his wit and his lernyng as well in things natural as in diuinit^ and
in many such things as men many years never attained to. Now when they
perceived that they could not against his conning any thing openly prevail:
they brought forth the serpentynes of false crime. And cried out that there
were.xiij. of his.ix.C questyons suspecte of herysye. Then Joined they to them
some good simple folk that should of zele to y^ faith and pretense of relygion
impugn those questions as new things and with which their eres had not be
in ure. In which impugnacyon though some of them happily lacked not good
mind: yet lacked they erudycyon and learning: which questyons:
notwitstondynge before that / not a few famous doctors of diuynyte had
approved / as good and clean and subcribed their names under them. But he not
berynge the loss of his fame made a defense for those xiij. questyons. A work
of great erudicyon and elegant and stuffed with the cognytyon of many things
worthy to be learned. which work he co^pyled in xx. nyghtes. In which hit
euedently appears: not only that those conclusyons were good and stondyng
with the faith: but also yt they: which had barked at them: were of folly and
rudeness to be reproved / which defense and all other things that he should
wrytethe committed like a good christen man to ye most holy judgment of our
mother holy chy^che / which defense received: and ye.xiij. questions duly by
delybera^yo^ examyned: our holy father ye pope approved Picus and tenderly
favored him / as by a bull of our holy father pope Alexandre the.vj. hit
plainly appears: but the book in which the hole.ix.C. questions with their
conclusions were contained (for as much as there were in them many things
strange and not fully declared and were more mete for secret communycacyon of
learned men then for open herynge of commune people which for lack of connyge
might take hurt thereby) Picus desired him self y^ hit should not be read.
And so was the redynge thereof forboden. Lo this end had Picus of his hye
mind and proud purpose / that where he thought to have gotten perpetual praise:
there had he much work to keep himself vpryght: that he ran not in
perpetual infamye and sclaundre.

Of the change of his life.
BUt as him self told his neuewe he judged y^ this came thus to pass: by the
especial provision and synguler goodness of almighty god / that by this false
crime untruly put upon him by his evil wyllers he should correct his very
errors / and that this should be to him (wandering in derkenes) as a shynynge
light: in which he might behold and consydre: how far he had gone out of y^
way of troth. For before this he had been both desirous of glory and kyndled
in vain love: and holden in volupteouse use of women. The comelynes of his
body with the lovely favor of his vysage / and therewith all his merueylouse
fame / his excellent lernynge^ great richesse and noble kyndred / set many
women a fire on him / from y^ desire of whom he not abhorrynge (y^ way of
life set a side) was somewhat fallen in to wantonness. But after that he was
ones with this variaunce wakened he drew back his mind flowynge in riot and
turned hit to christ / women's blandimentes he changed in to y^ desire of
heavenly joys and dispisynge the blaste of vaynglorye which he before desired /
now with all his mind he began to seek the glory and profit of christ's
church and so began he to order his condycions y^ from thens forth he might
have been approved and though his enemy were his judge.

Of the fame of his virtue and the r^sorte unto him therefore.
HEre upon shortly the same of his noble conning and excellent virtue both
far and nygh began gloryously to spring for which many worthy philosophres
(and that were taken in no^bre of the most conning) resorted bisely unto him
as to a market of good doctrine / some for to move questions and dyspute / some
(that were of more godly mind) to here and to take the wholesome lessons and
instruccyon of good living: which lessons were so much y^ more set by: in
how much they came from a more noble man and a more wise man and him also
which had him self some time followed y^ crooked hills of delycyouse pleasure
/ to the fastenynge of good dyscyplyne in the minds of y^ herers those things
seem to be of great effect: which be both of their own nature good and also
be spoken of such a master: as is converted to the way of justice from the
crooked and ragged path of voluptuouse living.

The burning of wanton books.
EYue books that in his youth of wanton ^sis of love with other like fantasies
he had made in his vulgar tongue: all together (in detestacyon of his vice
passed) and lest these tryfles mygh be some evil occasyon afterward he burned
them.

Of his study and dilygence in holy scripture.
ERom thensforth he gave him self day and night most fervently to the studyes
of scripture in which he wrote many noble books: which well testyfye both his
angylyke wit / his ardent labor / and his profou^de erudicyon of which books
some we have and some as an inestimable treasure we have lost. Great lybraries
hit is incredible to co^sydre with how meruelouse c^leryte he red them over /
and wrote out what him liked: of y^ old fathers of y^ church / so great
knowledge he had as hit were hard for him to have y^ has lived long and all
his life has done nothing else but red them. Of these newer dyuynes so good
judgment he had y^ it might appear there were nothing in any of the^ y^ were
unknown to him / but all thing as ripe as though he had all their works ever
before his eyes / but of all these new doctors he specyaliy commends saint
Thomas as him y^ enforseth him self in a sure pillar of truth / he was very
quick / wise / and subtyl in dispicions and had great felicite therein while he
had y^ hye stomak. But now a great while he had bode such conflictes farewell:
and every day more and more hated them / and so gretely abhored them: that
when hercules Estenlis duke of ferrare: first by messengers and after by him
self: desired him to dispute at ferrare: because the general chapter of
freres prechours was holden there / long hit was or he could be brought
thereto: but at the instant request of the duke which very syngulerly loved him
he came thither where he so behaved himself y^ was wo^dre ^o behold how all y^
audyence rejoiced to here him for hit were not possible for a man to utter
neither more co^nynge nor more co^nyngely. But hit was a commune saying with
him y^ such altercacyons were for a logition and not merely for a phylosophre
/ he said also that such disputacyons gretely profited as were exercised with
a peasyble mind to thenserchynge of the treuth in secret company without
great audyence: but he said that those dispicions did great hurt: y^ were
holden openly to the stentacio^ of learning and to win the favor of the
common people and the co^mendacyon of fools. He thought that utterly hit
could uneath be but that with the desire of worship (which these gasynge
dysputers gape after) there is with an inseparable bond annexed the appetite
of his co^fusyon and rebuke whom they argue with / which appetyte is a dedly
wound to y^ soul / and a mortal poison to charity there was nothing passed
him of those capicions soteltes and cauilacions of sophystrye / nor again there
was nothing y^ he more hated and abhored co^syderyng that they served of naught
but to y^ shamyng of such other folk as were in very seyence much better
learned and in those trifles ignorant. And y^ unto thensercherchynge of y^
treuth (to which he gave contynuall labor) they profyted little or naught.

Of his learning universally.
BUt because we will hold the reder no longer in hand: we will speak of his
learning but a word or twain generally / some man has shyned in eloquence
but ignorance of natural things has dishonested him / some men has floured
in the knowledge of diverse strange languages but he has wanted all the
cognicion of philosophye. Some man has read the inuencyons of the old
philosophres but he has not ben excercised in the new scoles. Some man has
sough conning as well philosophy as dyuinite for praise and vain glory and
not for any profit or encreace of christ's church. But Pycus all these
things with equal study has so received y^ they might seem by hepis as a
plentyouse streme to have flowen in to him. For he was not of ye co^dycion of
some folk (which to be excellent in one thing set al other aside) but he in
all sciences profyted so excellently: that which of them so ever he had
considered in him ye would have thought y^ he had taken that one for his only
study. And all these things were in him so much the more meruelouse in y^ he
came thereto by him self with ye strength of his own wit for the love of god
and profit his church without masters so that we may say of him that
Epycure the philosophre said of him that he was his own master.

Five causes yt in so short time brought him to se meruclouse conning.
To the bringing forth of so wondreful effects in so small time I consider
five causes to have come to gyder: first an incredyble wit / seco^dely a
merueylouse fast memore. Thyrdely great substance by y^ which to y^ byenge of
his books as wellaten as greek and other tongues he was especyally helped.vij.M.
ducates he had laid out in the gaderynge to gyther of volumes of all manner of
litterature. The fourth cause was his besy and infatigable study. The fyfte was
the contempt dispysynge of all erthly things.

Of his condycyons and his virtue.
BUt now let us pass over those powers of his soul which appertain to
understanding and knowledge and let us speak of them y^ belong to y^
acheuynge of noble acts / let us as we can declare his excellent co^dicions y^
his mind enflamed to godwarde may appear. And his riches given out to poor
folk may be understood / the^tent y^ they which shall here his virtue may
have occasyon thereby to give especial laud and thank therefore to almighty
god of whose infynyte goodness all grace and virtue comes.

Of the sale of his lordeshyppes and almysse.
Three year before his death (to the end that all the charge and besynes of rule
or lordshyp set a side he might led his life in rest and peace well
considering to what end this erthely honor and worldly dignite comes) all
his patrymonye and dominyons y^ is to say the third part of therldome of
Mirandula and of concordia: unto Johan francis his neuewe he sold / and that
so good chepe that hit seemed rather a gift then a sale. All that ever he
received of this bargayne partly he gave out to poor folk / partly he
bestowed in y^ byenge of a little land to the finding of hy^ and his
household. And over y^ much silver vessel and plate with other precyouse and
costly vtensiles of howsholde he divided among poor people. He was content
with mean fare at his table how be hit so^ what yet reteyny^ge of ye old
plenty in deynty vyande and silver vessel. Every day at certain hours he
gave him self to prayer. To pore men always if any came he plentiously gave out
his money: and not content only to give that he had him self ready: he wrote
over y^ / to one. Hierom Benineuius a florentin a well letred man (whom for his
great love toward him and ye integrite of his co^dycions he singulerly
favored) yt he should with his own money ever help poor folk: and give
maidens money to their marriage: and always send him word what he had laid out
that he might pay hit him ageyn. This office he committed to him that he might
ye more easily by hy^ as by a faithful messe^ger releue ye necessyte and miseri
of poor nedy people such as hy^ self happily could not come by ye knowledge
of.

Of ye volu^tary affleccio^ and payni^g of his own body.
Over all this: many times (which is not to be kept secret) he gave alms of
his own body: we know many men which (as saint Hierom says) put forth their
hand to poor folk: but with the pleasure of y^ flesh they be ouercome^: but
he: many days (and namely those days which represent unto us y^ passion and
death y^ Christ suffered for our sake) bet and scourged his own flesh in the
remembrance of that great benefyte and for clensynge of his old offenses.

Of his placabilite or benygne nature.
HE was of chere always merry and of so benygne nature y^ he was never troubled
with Ang^e and he said ones to his neuew that what so ever should happen (fell
their never so gtete mysaduenture) he he could never as him thought be moved to
wrath: but if his chystes perysshed i^ which his books lay: y^ he had with
great travail and watch ^piled. But for as much as he considered y^ he
labored only for y^ love of god and profit of his church: and y^ he had
dedicate unto him all his works / his studyes and his doings and since he saw
y^ sith god is almighty they could not miscarye but if it were either by his
commandment or by his sufferaunce: he verily trusted: sith god is all good:
y^ he would not suffer him to have that occasion of heaviness. O very happy mind
which none aduersyte might oppress / which no prosperyte might enhaunce: not
the conning of all philosophy was able to make him proud / not the knowledge
of the hebrewe / chaldey and arabie language beside greek and laten could make
him vayngloryouse / not his great substance / not his noble blood could blow
up his heart / not y^ beauty of his body / not y^ great occasyo^ of sin were
able to pull him bak in to y^ voluptuouse broad way y^ ledeth to hell: what
thing was there of so meruaylouse strength y^ might ouertorne y^ mind of hy^
(which now as seneke says) was gotten above fortune as he: which as well her
favor as her malice has set at naught / y^ he might be coupled with a
spiritull knot unto christ and his heavenly cytezeynes.

How he eschewed dygnites.
When he saw many men with great labor and money desire and bysely purchase ye
offices and dygnites of y^ ch^che (which are now a days alas y^ while ^munely
bought and sold) him self refused to recyue them: when two kings offered
the^: when an other man offered him great worldely promocyon if he would go to
ye kings court: he gave him such an answer / that he should well know that
he neither desired worship ne worldly riches but rather set the^ at naught y^
he might y^ more quyetly give him self to study and y^ service of god: this
wise he persuaded / y^ to a phylosophre and him y^ seeks for wisdom it was
no praise to gather richesse but to refuse them.

Of the dispysynge of worldly glory.
ALl praise of people and all erthly glory he reputed utterly: for nothing but
in y^ renayeng of this shadow of glory / he labored for very glory / which
ever more follows virtue as an inseperable servant / he said that same often
times did hurt to me^ while they live / and never good when they be deed / so
much only set he by his lerny^ge in how much he knew that hit was
profitable to y^ church and to y^ extermynation of errors. And over that he
was come to that prycke of perfyte humilite that he little forced wyther his
works went out under his own name or not so that they might as much profit
as if they were given out under his name. And now set he little by any other
books saueouely y^ bible / in y^ only studi of which: he had appointed him
self to spend the resedewe of his life / saving that y^ common profit
pricked him wha^ he co^sydered so many and so great works as he had conceived
and long trauayled vnpon how they were of every man by and by desired and
looked after.

How much he set more by deuceyon then conning.
THe little affection of an old man or an old woman to godwarde (were it
never so small) he set more by: the^ by all his owene knowledge as well of
natural things as godly. And oftentimes in communicacyon he would admonysshe
his familyar friends how greatly these mortal things bow and draw to an end
how slyper and how falling hit is y^ we live in now: how ferme how stable it
shall b^ y^ we shall here after live in / whether we be thrown down in to hell
or lyfce up in to heaven. Wherefore he exhorted the^ to turn up their minds to
love god which was a thing far excellynge all the co^nynge y^ is possible
for us in this life to obtain. The same thing also in his book which he
entytled de ente et vnolyghtsomely he treats where he interupteth y^ course
of his dispicion and turnynge his words to Angelus Politianus (to whom he
dedycateth that book) he writes in this wise. But now behold o my well-beloved
Angel what madness holds us. Love god (while we be in this body) we rather
may: than either know him or by speech utter him. In loving him also we more
profit our self / we labor less and serve him more / and yet had we lever
always by knowledge never find y^ thing that we seek: then by love to possede
y^ thing: which also without love were in vain found.

Of his liberalite and contempt of richesse.
LIberalite only in him passed measure for so far was he from y^ begy^nyng
of any diligence to erthely things that he seemed somewhat be^prent with the
frekyll of negligence / his friends oftentimes admonysshed him that he should
not all utterly dispycerychesse / showing him y^ hit was his dishoneste and
rebuke when it was reported (were it treue or false) that his negligence and
setting naught by money gave his servants occasyon of disceye and robbry
Nevertheless that mind of his: (which evermore on high cleued fast in
co^te^p^acion and in thenserchynge of natures counsel) could never let down
hit self to y^ co^sideracion and ouerseynge of these base abiecte and vile
erthly tryfles. His high stuarde came on a time to him and desired him to
receive his accomt of such money as he had in many years received of his: and
brought forth his books of reckoning. Picus answered him in this wise / my
friend (says he) I know well ye have might oftentimes and yet may desceyue
me and ye list / wherefore the examinacyon of these expe^ses shall not need.
There is no more to do / if I be ought in your det I shall pay you by and by /
if ye be in mine pay me / either now if ye have hit: or here after if ye be now
not able.

Of his loving mind and ^tuouse behauour to his fre^ndes.
HIs lovers and friends with great benygnite and curtesye he entreted / whom he
used in all secret co^muninge ^tuously to exhort to godward whose goodely
words so effectually wrought in y^ herers: y^ where a co^nynge man (but not so
good as co^nynge) came to him on a day for y^ great fame of his lernyng to
common with him as they fell in talking of ^tue he was with the words of
Picus so thoroughly perced that forth withal he forsook his accustomed vice and
reformed his condicyons. The words y^ he said unto him were these if we had
ever more before our eyes ye paynful death of christ which he suffered for the
love of us: and than if we would again think upon our death we should well
beware of sin. Merueylouse benignyte and curtesy he showed unto th^^ not whom
strength of body or goods of fortune magnified but to them whom learning and
condicio^s bound hy^ to favor / for simylytude of manners is a cause of love
and frendeshyp. Alikenes of conditions is (as Appollonius says an affinyte.

what he hated and what he loved.
THere was nohyng more odiouse nor more intoliberable to hy^ than as (horace
says) ye proud palaces of stately lords / wedding and wordly besynes / he
fled almoost a like: notwithstondynge when he was axed ones in sport whyther
of those two burdeynes seemed lyghter and which he would chese if he should of
necessite be driven to that one and at his elec^^n: which he stiked thereat a
wyle but at ye last he shoke his heed and a little smylyng he answered yt he
had lever take hy^ to marriage / as ye thing in which was less seruytude and
not so much ieoperdy / lyberte above all thing he loved to which both his
own natural affeccon and ye study of philosophy enclyned him: and for yt was
he always wa^deryng and flytynge and would never take him sefe to any certain
dwelling.

Of his fervent love to god.
OF outward obseruau^ces he gave no very great force we speak not of those
obseruaunces which the church conmaundeth to be observed for in those he was
dilyge^t but we speak of those cerymonyes which folk bring up setting ye
very service of god a side which is (as christ says) to be worshipped in
spirit and in treuth. But in the inward affectes of the mind he cleued to
god with very fervent love and devotion / some time that meruelouse alacrite
langwysshed and almoost fell: and efte again with great ftrength rose up in to
god. In the love of whom he so fervently burned that on a time as he walked
with Johan frau^cis his neuewe in an orcharde at farrare in y^ talking of the
love of christ he brake out in to these words / neuew said he this will I
show the I warn the keep it secret: the substance y^ I have left after
c^rtayne books of mine finysshed I entende to give out to pore folk and
seneynge my self with the crucifyx (...) about the world in every town and
ca^^ (...) pose to preche of christ. Afterward I (...) by the e^pecyall
commandment of god he (...) that purpose and appointed to pro^^^^ (...) in
the order of freres prechours.

Of his death.
IN ye year of our redemption.M.CCCC.iCiiij. when he had fulfilled ye.xxxij.
year of his age and (...) at florence he was suddenly taken with a fervent axes
which so ferforth crepte in to ye interior^ pert^s of his body y^ hit despised
all medycynes and overcame all remedy and compelled him within three days to
^atisfye nature and repaye her ye life which he received of her.

Of his behauyour in the extremes of his life.
AFter that he had r^ceyued the holy body of our savior when they offered
unto him the crucyfyx (y^ the image of christ's ineffable passion suffered for
our sake: he might ere he gave up the ghost / receive his full draught of love
and co^passyon in the beholdynge of that pytefull figure as a strong defense
against all aduersyte and a sure port culiouse against wikked spirits / the
priest demanded him whether he fermly believed y^ crucyfyx to be the Image of
him that was very god and very man which in his godhed was before all time
begoten of his father: to whom he is also equal in all thing: and which of
ye holy ghos^ god also: of him and of the father coeternalli goy^ge forth
(which.iij. persons be one god) was in y^ chaste womb of our lady a
perpetual virgyne conceived in time / which suffered hungre / thrust / hete /
cold / labor / travail / and watch. And which at the last for washing
of our spotty syn^e co^tracted and drawn unto us in the sin of Adame for the
sovereign love that he had to mankind: in the altar of the cross wyllyngely
and gladly shed out his most precyouse blood. when y^ priest inquired of him
these things and such other as they be wont to enquere of folk in such
case. Picus answered him y^ he not only believed hit but also certainly knew
it. wha^ y^ one Abertus his systers sone a young man both of wit / conco^nynge
/ and co^dicyons: excellent: began to comfort him against death: and by natural
reason to show him why hit was not to be fered but strongely to be taken: as
y^ only thing which makes an end of all y^ labor / pain / trouble / and
sorrow of this short miserable deedly life: he answered y^ this was not the
cheyese thing y^ should make him ^tent to dye: because y^ death determyneth the
many fold incommoditees and paynfull wretchedness of this life: but rather this
cause should make him not content only: but also glad to dye: for that death
makes an end of sin: in as much as he trusted: y^ shortness of his life
should leave him no space to sin and offend. He asked also all his servants
forgyuenes / if he had ever before that day offended any of them. for whom he
had provided by his testament.viij. years before / for some of them mete and
drynk / for some money / each of them after their deseruynge. He showed also to
the above named Albertus and many other credible persons y^ y^ queen of heaven
came to him y^ night with a meruaylouse fragrant odor refresshynge all his
me^bres y^ were brosed and frusshed with that fever and promised him that he
should not utterly dye. He lay always with a plesaunt and a merry countenance
and in the very twytches and panges of death he spoke as though he beheld y^
heuens opene. And all y^ came to him and saluted him offering their service:
with very loving words he received / thanked / and kyssed. The executour of his
moveable goods he made one Antony his brother. The heyer of his lands he made
y^ pore people of the hospytall of florence. And in this wise in to ye hands
of our sauyoure he gave up his spirit.

How his death was taken.
What sorrow and heaviness his departing out of this world was: both to rich
and pore high and low: well testyfyeth the princes of Italye / well witnesses
the citees and people / well records the great benygnyte and synguler
curtesye of Charles king of france / which as he came to florence entendynge
from thens to Rome and so forth in his vyage against the Realm of Naples
herynge of the sykenes of Picus in all conuenyent haste he sent him two of his
own phisicions as embassiatours both to viset him and to do him all y^ help
they might. And over that sent unto him letters susbcribed with his own hand
full of such humanyte and courteyse offres: as the been volent mind of such
a noble prince and the worthy virtues of Picus required.

Of the state of his soul.
AFter his death (and not long after) one hieronimus a friar prechour of
^errare a man as well in co^nynge as holiness of living most famous. In a
sermon which he reherced in the cheyfe church (...) all florence said unto
the people in this wise. O thou Cite of florence I have a secret thing to
show the which is as true as y^ gospel of saint John^ I would have kept hit
secret but I am compelled to show hit. For he that has auctoryte to
command me / has bid me publysshe hit. I suppose verily that there be none
of you but ye knew John^ Picus earl of Mirandula / a man in whom god had heped
many great gifts and synguler graces / y^ church had of him an inestymable
loss / for I suppose if he might have had the space of his life prorogyd: he
should have excelled (by such works as he should have left behind hy^) all
them y^ dyed this.viij.C. year before him / he was wont to be conuersaunt with
me and to break to me y^ secrets of his heart in which I perceived that he
was by priuey inspyraciou called of god unto rely gio^. wherefore he purposed
oftentimes to obey this inspyracyo^ and follow his calling. howbehit not
being kind enough for so great benefices of god: or called bak by the
tenderness of his flesh (as he was a man of delicate complexion) he shranke
from the labor / or thinking happily y^ the religion had no need of him
differred hit for a time / howbehit this I speak only by conjecture. But for
this delay I thretened him two year together: y^ he would be punysshed if he
for slowthed that purpose which our lord had put in his mind / and certeynely
I prayed to god my sefe (I will not lie therefore) that he might be somewhat
beten: to compel him to take that way which god had from above showed him.
But I desired not this scourge upon him y^ he was beten with: I looked not for
that: but our lord had so decreed that he should forsake this present life
and leave a part of that noble crown that he should have had in heaven.
Notwithstondyng y^ most benygne judge has dalt mercyfully with him: and for his
plentyouse alms given out with a free and liberal hand unto poor people and
for the devout prayers which he most instantly offered unto god this favor
he has: thought his soul be not yet in the bosom of our lord in the
heavenly Joy: yet is hit not on y^ other side deputed unto perpetual pain but
he is adiuged for a while to the fire of purgatory there to suffer pain for a
season / which I am y^ gladder to show you in this byhalfe: so the intent y^
they which knew him: and such inspectally as for his many fold benyfy^^s are
singulerly beholden unto him: should now with their prayers alms and other
suffrages help him. These things this holy man hierom this servant of god
openly affermed / and also said that he kn^w well if helyed in that place: he
were worthy eternal da^pnacion. And over y^ he said y^ he had known all those
things within a certain time / bu^ y^ words which Picus had said in his
sykenes of y^ aperyng of our lady caused him to doubt and to fere lest Picus
had be deceived by some illusyon of y^ deuyll^ In as much as the promise of our
lady seemed to have been frustrate by his death / but afterward he vudersode y^
Picus was deceived in the e^ocacyon of y^ word while she spoke of y^ second
death and ever lasty^g: and he undertook her of y^ first death and temporal. And
after this y^ same hierom showed to his acquayntau^ce y^ Picus had after his
death apered unto him all ^paced in fire and showed unto him y^ he was such wise
i^ purgatory punyshed for his negligence and his unkindness. Now sith hit is so
that he is abiuged to y^ fire from which he shall undoubtedly depert unto glory
and no man is sure how long hit shall be first: and may be y^ shorter time for
our intercessyons. Let every christen body show their charity upon him to
help to speed him thither where after the long habitacion with y^ inhabytauntes
of this derke world (to whom his goodly co^uersacio^ gave great light) and
after y^ dark fire of purgatory (in which venyall offenses be cle^sed) he may
shortly (if he be not all ready) enter y^ inaccessible and i^finite light of
heaven where he may in y^ ^sence of y^ soue raygne godhed so pray for us y^ we
may y^ rather by his in^cessio^ be perteyners of y^ inspecable Joy which we
have prayed to bring hy^ spedely to. Ame^.

Here ends ye life of John^ Picus earl of Mirandula.
Here follows three epistles of y^ said Picus of which three: two be written unto
Johan Fraunsces his neuew / the third unto one Andrewe Corneus a noble man of
Italy.
The argument and matter of the first epistle of Picus unto his neuew Johan
Fraunsces.
HIt apereth by this epistle y^ Johan Fraunsces the neuew of Picus had broken
his mind unto Picus and had made him of counceyll in some secret godly
purpose which he intended to take upon him / but what this purpose should be:
upon this lettre can we not fully perceive. Now after y^ he thus intended /
there fell unto him many impedunentes and diverse occasyons which withs^ode his
intent and in manner let him and pulled him bak / wherefore Picus comforts
him in this epistle and exorteth him to perseuerau^ce / by such means as are
in the epistle euydent and plain enough. Notwithstondynge in y^ beginning of
this lettre where he says that the flesh shall (but if we take good head)
make us drunk in the cups of Cerces and mysshappe us in to the lykenes a
figure of bruyte beestes: those words if ye perceive them not: be in this
wise vnderstonden. There was sometime in a woman called Circes which by
enchauntemente as vyrgyll makes mencyon used with a drink to turn as many
men: as received hit in to diverse likeness a fygures of sondrye beestes / some
in to lyones / some in to beeres / some in to swyne / some in to wolfes / which
afterward walked ever tame about her house and waited upon her in such use
or service as she list to put unto them. In likewise the flesh if it make us
drunk in y^ wine of voluptuous pleasure or make the soul leave the noble use
of his reason and enclyne unto sensualite and affeccions of y^ body: then the
flesh chau^geth us from the figure of reasonable men in the lykenes of
unreasonable beestes / and y^ dyuersly: after the co^uenience and symylytude
between our sensual affeccyons and the brutysshe proprytees of sundry beestes.
As the proud hearted man in to a lion / the Irous in to a beer / the
lecherouse in to a got. The dro^ken gloten in to a swyne / the ravenous
extorcyoner in to a wolf the false desceyuoure in to a fox / mokkynge gester
in to an ape. From which beestly shappe may we never be restored to our own
lykenes again: unto the time we have cast up again the drink of the bodily
affeccyons by which we were in to these fygures enchaunted. When there comes
sometime a monstrouse be to the town we run and are glad to pay some
money to have sight thereof / but I fere if men would look upon them self
aduysedly: they should se a more monstrouse be nerer home: for they should
perceive themself by y^ wretched inclinacion to diverse beestly passions
changed in their soul not in to the shap of one but of many beestes / y^ is
to say of all the^ whose brutysh appetytes they follow. Let us the^ beware as
picus co^celleth us y^ we be not dro^ke^ in y^ cups of cerees y^ is to say in
y^ sensual affeccio^s of y^ flessh lest / we deforme y^ image of god in our
souls after whose image we be made and make our self worse then idolatres for
if he be odiouse to god which turns y^ image of a be in to god: how much
is he more odious which corneth the image of god in to a be.

Johan Picus earl of Mirandula to Johan Fraunsces his neuew by his brother
health in him that is very health.
THat thou have had many evil occasyons after thy departing which trouble the
and stand against the virtuous purpose that thou have taken there is no cause
my sone why you sholdest either marvel thereof / be sorry therefore / or dread
hit / but rather how great a wondre were this if only to y^ among mortal men
y^ way lay open to heaven with out swet as thought y^ now at erst / the
disceytfull world and the cursed devil failed / and as though thou were not
yet in y^ flesh: which coueyteth against the spyrite: and which false flessh
(but if we watch and look well to ourself) shall make us drunk in ye cups of
circes and so deforme us in to monstrous shappes of brutyssh and unreasonable
beestes. Remember also that of this evil occasyons the holy apostle saint
James says you have cause to be glad writynge in this wise. ^ aude^e fratres
qm^ in temptationes varias in cideritis. Be glad says he my brethren when ye
fall in diverse temptacions / and not causeles for what hope is there of glory
if there be none hope of victory: or what place is there for victory where
there is no batayl: he is called to the crown and triu^phe which is provoked
to the conflycte and namely to that conflyct: in which no man may be ouercom
against his will / and in which we need none other strength to vaynquyssh but
y^ we list our self to vaynquissh. Uery happy is a christen man sith y^ y^
victory is both put in his own frewyll: and the reward of the vyctory shall
be far greter than we can either hope or wysshe. Tell me I pray y^ my most
dear sone if there be ought in this life of all those thingis: y^ delight whereof
so vexes and tossith these erthly minds Is there I say oni of those trif^es:
i^ y^ geti^g of which a man must not suffer many labors many displeasurs and
many miseries or he get hit. The merchant thi^kith him self well served if
after.x. years sailing / after a.m. inco^moditees / after a.m. Ieopardyes of
his life he may at last have a little the more gadered to gyther. Of the court
and service of this world there is nothing y^ I need to write unto the / the
wretchedness whereof the experience hit self has taught the and daily techeth.
In obtaynyng y^ favor of y^ princes / in purchasing the frendshyp of y^
company in ambicyouse labor for offices and honors. What an hepe of heaviness
there is: how great anguissh: how much besynes and trouble. I may rather learn
of the then teache y^ / which holding my self co^^ent with my books and rest /
of a child have learned to live within my degree and as much as I may
dwelling with my self nothing out of my self labor for / or long for. Now
then these erthly things slyper / uncertain / vile and common / also to us
and bruyte be: swetynge and pantynge we shall uneath obtain: and look we
than to heavenly things and goodly (which neither eye has seen nor ere has
herd nor heart has thought) to be drawn slu^bry and slepyng magrey our teth:
as though neither god might reygne nor those heavenly citezyns live without us.
Certaynely of this worldly felicite were gotten to us with ydelnes and ease than
might some man that shrynketh from labor: rather chese to serve y^ world
then god. But now if we be for labored in the way of sin as much as in the
way of god and much more (whereof the dampened wretches cry out. ^ assatisumus
in via iniquitatis. we be weryed in the way of wyckednes) then must it needs
be apoynte of extreme madness if we had not lever labor there where we go from
labor to reward then where we go from labor to pain. I pass over how great
peace and felycite hit is to the mind when a man has nothing that grudgeth
his conscience nor is not appaled with the secret twiche of any preuye cryme^
this pleasure undoubtedly far excels all y^ pleasurs y^ in this life may
be obtained or desired: what thing is there to be desired among y^ delytes of
this world? which in y^ seeking weary us / in y^ having blyndeth us / in y^
lesyng payneth bs. Doubtest y^ my sone whether the minds of wicked men be
vexed or not with co^tynuall thought and torment: hit is y^ word of god which
neither may deceive nor be deceyuer Cor impij quasi mare feruens quod
quicscere no^ potest. The wicked man's heart is like a stormy see y^ may not
rest / there is to hy^ nothing sure / nothing peseable but all thing ferefull
/ all thing sorrowful / all thing deedly. Shall we then envy these me^: shall
we follow them: and forgetynge our own country heaven / and our own heavenly
father where we were / free borne: shall we wylfully make our self their
bondemen: and with them wretchedly living: more wretchedly dye. And at y^ last
most wretchedly in everlasting fire be punisshed. O the derke minds of men. O
the blind hertes. Who seyth not more clear than light that all these things
be (as they say) truer than truth hit self / and yet do we not that y^ we
know is to be done. In vain we would pluk our foot out of the clay but we
styk still. There shall come to the my sone doubt hit not (in these places
namely where thou art co^uersau^t innumerable impedimentes every hour: which
might fere the from the purpose of good and virtuous living (and but if thou
be ware) shall throw the down hedlynge. But among all things the very
deedly pestylence is this: to be conuersaunt day and night among them whose
life is not only on every side an allectyue to sin: but over that all set in
the expugnacio^ of virtue / under their captain the devil / under the
banayre of death / under the stipende of hell / fighting against heaven /
against our lord god and against his church. But cry thou therefore with y^
prophet. Diru^ pamus vincula little and proijciamus a nobis iugum ipsorum. Let
us break the bands of them and let us cast of the yooke of them. These be they
whom (as y^ gloriouse apostle saint Paul seith) our lord has delivered in to
the passions of rebuke and to a reprouable sense to do those things that are
not conuenyente / full of all iniquite / full of envy / manslaughter /
contenton / gyle / and malice / backbiters odiouse to god ^tumeliouse proud /
stately / fynders of evil things / folysshe / dissolute / without affecion
without covenant / without merry which when they daily the justice of god /
yet understand they not y^ such as these things committee: are worthy death /
not only they y^ do such things: but also they which consent to y^ doing:
wherefore my child go thou never about to please them: whom virtue displeases
/ but evermore let these words of y^ apostyll be before thyn eyes. O porter
magis deo placere quod hoi^bus. We must rather please god then men / and
rembe^bre these words of saint Paul also. Sihominibus placerem ^eruus christi
non essem If I should please men I were not christ's servant. Let enter to
thyn heart an holy pride and have dysdayne to take them for masters of thy
living which have more need to take y^ for a master of theyrs. Hit were
far more semy^ge y^ they should with y^ by good living begin to be men then
thou sholdest with them by ye leuynge of the good purpose shamfully begin to be
a best. There holds me sometime by almighty god as hit were even a swone and
(...) insensibilite for wondre when I begin in my self: I wot never whether I
shall sey: to remember or to sorrow / to meruayule or to bewail the apetytes
of men / or if I shall more plainly speak: y^ very madness not to believe the
gospel whose truth the blood of marters cries / y^ voice of apostles
sowneth / miracles proves / reason co^fermeth / y^ world testifyeth / y^
elements speaks / deuylles confesses. But a far gr^^^^ madness is hit if
thou doubt not but that the gospel is true: to live then as though thou
doubtest not but that hit were false. For if these words of the words of the
gospel be true / that hit is very hard for (...) kyngedome of heaven why do we
daily th^^ gape after the hepynge up of riches. And if this be true that we
should seek for the glory and praise not that comes of men / but that comes
of god / why do we then ever hang upon the judgment and opinyon of men and no
man rekketh whether god like him or not. And if we surely believe y^ ones the
time shall come in which our lord shall say go ye cursed people in to
eueuerlastynge fire / and again come ye my blessed children possede ye the
kingdom y^ has been prepared for you from y^ fourmynge of the world / why is
there nothing then y^ we less fere then hell or y^ we less hope for then the
kyngedome of god. What shall we say else but y^ there be many christen men in
name but few in deed. But thou my sone enforce thy self to enter by the
streygh gate y^ ledeth to heaven and take no head what thing many men do: but
what thing y^ verey law of nature / what thing very reason what thing our
lord hy^ self shows y^ to be done for neither thy glory shall be less if y^
be happy with few nor thy pain more easy if y^ be wretched with many. Thou
shall hour.ij. specially effectual remedies against y^ world and the devil
with which two as with.ij. whynges: thou shall out of this vale of miserye be
lift up in heaven / that is to say alms deed and prayer / what may we do
without the help of god or how shall he help us if he be not called upon.

But over that certaynely he shall not here the when thou call on him if
thou here not first y^ poor man whai. he calls upon y^ and verily hit is
according that god should despise the being a man when thou being a man
despysest a man. For hit is written in what mesure y^ ye mete: hit shall be mete
you again And in an other place of y^ gospel hit is said blyssed be merciful
men for they shall get mercy / when I styre the to prayer I styre y^ not to y^
prayer which sto^deth in many words but to that prayer which in y^ secret
chamber of the mind / in the preuy closet of y^ soul with very affecte
speaks to god and in y^ most lyghtsome darkness of contemplacion not only
presents the mind to the father: but also vnteth hit with him by inspekable
ways which only they know y^ have assayed. Nor I care not how long or how
short thy prayer be / but how effectual how ardente and rather interrupted and
broken between with sighs then drawn on length with a contynuall row and
nombre of words / if thou love thine health if thou desire to be sure from y^
grennes of y^ devil / from the storms of this world / from thawayte of
thyn enemies if y^ long to be acceptable to god if thou coueyte to be happy at
the last: let no day pass the but thou ones at the lestwise present thy self
to god by prayer and falling down before him flat to y^ ground with an humble
affecte of devout mind not from y^ extremyte of thy lips but out of y^
inwardnes of thyn heart cry these words of y^ prophet. Delicta iuue^tutis me
ignora^tias meas ne meminer^s sed secu^dum misericordia^ tua^ memento mei
propter bonitate^ tua^ dn^e. The effences of my youth and mine ignoraunces
remember not good lord / but after thy mercy lord for thy goodness remember
me. when y^ shall in thy prayer axe of god: both y^ holy spyryte which prays
for us and eke thyn own necessyte shall every hour put in thy mind / and
also what thou shalt pray for: you shall find matter enough in y^ redynge of
holy scripture which y^ thou would now (setting poets fables and tryfles a
side) take ever in thyn hand I hartly pray y^. Thou may do not hynge more
pleasant to god nothing more profitable to thy self: then if thyn hand
cease not day nor night to turn and read the volumes of holy scripture. There
lies pryuely in them a certain heavenly strength quyk and effectual with a
merueylous power transfourmeth and chau^geth y^ reders mind in to the love of
god if they be clean and lowly entreated. But I have passed now y^ bounds of
lettre / y^ matter drawing me forth and the great love y^ I have had to the /
both ever before: and specially: sith y^ hour in which I have had first
knowledge of thy most holy purpose. Now to make an end with this one thing I
warn y^ (of which when we were last together I often talked with y^) that y^
never forget these.ij. things / y^ both y^ sone of god dyed for y^ and y^ thou
shall also thy self dye shortly live y^ never so long / with these twain as
with two spurs y^ one of fere y^ other of love: spur forth thyn horse
thorugh y^ short way of this momentarye life to y^ reward of eternal
felicyte sith we neither ought nor may prefexe our self onye other end than
the endless fruycion of y^ infinite goodness both to soul and body in
everlasting peace. Fare well and fere god.

The matter or argument of the epistle of Picus to Andrewe Corncus.
THis Andrewe a worshypfull man and a especial friend of Picus had by his
lettres given him counceyll to leave the study of philosophy as a thing in
which he thought Picus to have spent time enough and which: but if it were
applied to y^ use of some actual besmes: he iuged a thing vain and
unprofitable / wherefore he cou^ceyled Pycus to surceace of study and put him
self with some of y^ great princes of Italy / with whom ( as this Andrew
said) he should be much more fruytefully occupied the^ always in the study and
lernyng of philosophye / to whom Picus answered as in this present epestle
appears where he says these words (By this hit should follow y^ hit were
either seruyle or at the lestwyse not pryncely to make y^ study of philosophy
other then mercennari) thus he means. Merce^nary we call all those things
which we do for hyre or reward. Then he makes philosophy merce^nary and
uses hit not as co^nynge but as marchau^dyse which studyeth hit not for
pleasure of hit self: or for the instruccyon of his mind in mortal virtue:
but to apply hit to such things where he may get some lucre or worldly
advantage.

Johan Picus earl of Myrandula to Andrewe Corneus gretynge.
Ye exhort me by your letters to the cyuyle and actyue life saying y^ in
vain: and in manner to my rebuke and shame have I so long studied in
philosophy. But if I would at the last exercise y^ learning in y^ entretynge
of some profitable acts and outward bysynes. Certainly my well-beloved Andrewe
I had cast away both cost and labor of my study: if I were to minded that I
could find in my heart in this matter to assent unto you and follow your
council. This is a very deedly and monstrous persuacyon which has entered the
minds of men: beleuynge that ye studyes of phylosophye are of estates and
pry^ces: either utterly not to be touched: or at lest wise with extreme lyppes
to be sypped (and rather to the pomp and ostentacio^ of their wit) then to the
culture and profit of their minds to be little and easily tasted. The words
of Neoptolentus they hold utterly for a sure decree that philosophy is to be
studied either never or not long / but the sayenges of wise men they repute
for I apes and v^ry fables: that sure and steadfast felicite stondeth only in
the goodness of the mind and that these outward things of ye body or of
fortune little or naught pertayne unto us. But here ye will say to me thus. I
am content ye study / but I would have you outwardly occupied also. Ind I
desire you not so to embrace martha that ye should utterly forsake Mary. Love
them and use them both as well study as worldly occupacion. Trewly my welbe
loved friend in this point I gain sey you not / they that so do I find no
fault in nor I blame them not / but certainly hit is not all one to sey we do
well if we do so: and to sey me do evil but if we do so / this is far out of
the way: to think that from contemplacyon to the actyse living that is to sey
from the better to the worse is none error to declyne And to think that it
were shame to abide still in the better and not declyne.

Shall a man then be rebuked by cause that he desyryth and ensues virtue only
for hit self: by cause he studyeth ye mysteryes of god: by cause he ensercheth
the counceyll of nature by cause he uses continually this plesau^t ease and
rest: seeking none outward thing dispising all other thing: sych those
things are able suffyciently to satisfye ye desire of their folowers. By this
rakenynge hit is a thing either seruyle or at ye lest wise not princely to
make ye study of wysdom other then merce^narye / who may well here this who may
suffer hit. Certainly he never studied for wisdom which so studied therefore
that in time to come either he might not or would not study therefore / this man
rather excercised ye study of marchaundyse then of wysedom. Ye write unto me
that hit is time for me now to put my self in houshoulde with some of the
great princes of Italy but I se well yt as yet ye have not known the opynion
that phylosophres have of them self which (as horace says) repute the^ self
kings of kings: they love lyberte: they can not bear ye proud manners of
estates: they can not serve. They dwell with them self and be content with the
tranquyllyte of their own mind they suffyce them self and more / they seek
nothing out of them self: ye things that are had in honor among ye
conmune people: among them be not holden honorable. All that ever the
voluptuouse desire of men thyrsteth for: or ambycyon sygheth for: they set at
naught and despise. Which while hit belongs to all men: yet undoubtedly it
perteyneth most proprely to them whom fortune has so lyberaly favored that
they may live not only well and plenteously but also nobly. These great
fortunes lift up a man hye and setteh him out to the show: but oftentimes as a
fyerse and a skyttyssh horse they cast of their master. Certeynly always they
grieve and vex him and rather tere him then bear him. The golden mediocrite the
mean estate is to be desired which shall bear us as hit were in hands more
easeli. which shall obey us and not maystre us. I therefore abydyng fermely in
this opynyo^: set more by my little house my study the pleasure of my books / y^
rest and peace of my mind: then by all your kings palaces all your common
besynes / all your glory / all the advantage that ye hawke after and all the
favor of the court. Nor I look not for this fruit of my study y^ I may
thereby herafter be tossed in the flode and rombelyng of your worldly business:
but y^ I may ones bring forth the children that I travail on: y^ I may give
out some books of my nowne to the common proffyte which may sumwhat savor: if
not of co^nyng yet at the lest wise of wit and dylygence. And by cause ye shall
not thynk that my travail and dyligence in study is any thing remytted or
slakked. I give you knowledge y^ after great fervent labor with much watch and
infatygable travail I have learned both the he brew language and the chaldey
and now have I set hand to overcome the great dyffyculte of the Araby tongue.
These my dear friend be things: which to apertaine to a noble prince I have
ever thought and yet think. Fare ye well. written at Paris the.xv. day of

The argument of the epistle following.
AFter that Johan Fraunsces ye neuew of Picus had (as hit apereth in ye first
epistle of Picus to him) begone a change in his living: hit seems by this
lettre y^ the company of the court where he was co^uersaunt diversely (as hit is
there unmannerly manner) descanted thereof to his rebuke as them thought: but as
truth was unto their own. Some of them iuged hit folly / some called hit
ypocresy / some scorned him / some sclaundred him / of all which demeanor (as
we may of this epistle conjecture) he wrote unto this earl Picus his uncle
which in this lettre comforted and encourages him as hit is in y^ course
thereof euydent.

Johan Picus earl of Myrandula to Frau^sces his neuew gretynge in our lord.
HAppy art thou my sone when that our lord not only gives the grace well to
live but also that while thou lyuest well he gives y^ grace to bear evil words
of evil people for thy living well. Certainly as great a praise as hit is to
be commended of them y^ are commendable as great a co^mendacio^ it is to be
reproved of them y^ are reprouable. Notwithstondynge my sone I call the not
therefore happy by cause this false reprofe is worshypfull and glorious unto the /
but for because y^ our lord Jesus christ (which is not only true but also
truth hit self) affermeth that our reward shall be plenteous in heaven when
men speak evil to us and speak all evil against us living for his name. This
is an Apostles dignyte: to be reputed dygne before god to be defamed of wykked
folk for his name. For we read in the gospel of luke that the appostles went
joyful and glad from y^ counseill house of the jews because god had accepted
them as worthy to suffer wrong and repreffe for his sake. Let us therefore
Joy and be glad if we be worthy so great worship before god y^ his worship be
showed in our rebuke. And if we suffer of y^ world any thing that is grievous or
bitter: let this sweet voice of our lord be our consolacion. Simundus vos odio
habet scitote ^priore^ me vobis habuit. If the world (says our lord) hate
you: know ye y^ hit hated me before you. If y^ world then hated him by whom
y^ world was made: we most vile and simple men and worthy (if we co^sydre out
wreched living well) all shame and reproufe: if folk bakbyte us and say
evil of us: shall we so grievously take hit y^ lest they should say evil we
should begin to do evil. Let us rather gladly receive these evil words and if
we be not so happy to suffer for virtue and truth as the old seyntes suffered
betynges / byndynges / prison / swerdes / and death. Let us think at the lest
wise we be well served if we have ye grace to suffer chiding / detraccion /
and hatred of wikked men / lest y^ if all occasion of deseruynge be taken away
there be left us none hope of reward / if men for thy good living praise the:
thy virtue certainly in y^ hit is virtue makes the like unto christ: but in
that hit is praised hit makes the unlike him: which for the reward of his
virtue received y^ opprobryouse death of the cross for which as the apopstle
says god has exalted him and given him a name y^ is above all names. More
desyrefull is than to be condemned of the world and exalted of god then to be
exalte^ of the world and condemned of god / y^ world condemns to life: god
exalts to glory: y^ world exateth to a fall / god condempneth to y^ iyre of
hell / fynably if y^ world fawn upon y^: uneath hit may be but y^ thy virtue
(which all lift upward should have god alone to please) shall somewhat unto y^
blandisshynge of y^ world and favor of y^ people inclyne. And so though hit
lose nothing of y^ integrite of our perfeccio^ yet hit leseth of the reward
which reward while hit begins to be paid in y^ world where all thing is
little hit shall be less i^ heaven where al thing is great. O happy rebukes which
make us sure: y^ neither y^ flower of our virtue shall wyther with the pestilent
blast of vaynglorye: nor our eternal reward be mynysshed for the vayn
promocion of a little populate fame. Let us my sone love these rebukes and
only of y^ ignomynye and reprefe of our lords cross. Let us like feythfull
servants with an holy ambyeyon be proud. we (says saint Paul) preche
christ cruci^yed which is unto y^ jews dispite / unto y^ gentyles folly / unto
us y^ virtue and wysedom of god. The wysdom of this world is folysshnes before
god and the folly of christ is y^: by which he has overcome y^ wysedom of y^
world by which hit has pleased god to make his beliuy^g people safe. If that
thou doubt not but y^ they be mad which bakbite thy virtue: which: the
christen living y^ is very wisdom reputeth for madness / ^sidre than how much
were thy madness: if thou sholdest for the judgment of mad men swerve from
the good institucio^ of thy life namely since all error is with amendeme^t to
be taken away and not with imitation and following to be encreaced. Let them
therefore nyghe / let them bawl / let them karke / go thou baldely forth thy
journey as thou have begone and of the wyckednes and mysery consider how much
thy self art beholden to god which has illumined y^ sitting in the shadow
of death and translatynge the out of the company of them (which like dro^ken
men with out aguyde wandre hither and thither in obscure derkenes) has
associate the to the children of light. Let that same sweet voice of our lord
always sown in thyn eres. Sine mortuos sepclire mortuos suos tu me sequere.
Let deed men alone with deed men: follow thou me / deed be they that live not
to god and in the space of this temporal death laboryously purchase them self
eternal death. Of whom if y^ axe whereto they draw: whereto they refer their
studyes / their works and their besynes and finally what end they have
appointed them self in the adopcyon whereof they should be happy / either they
shall have utterly nothing to answer / or they shall bring forth words
repugnaunt in them self and contrary each to other like the rauynge of bedelem
people. Nor they wot never them self what they do but like them that swyme in
swyfte flodes they be borne forth with y^ violence of evil custom as hit were
with the boystious course of y^ streme. And their wikkednes blyndynge them on
this side: and the devil prikkynge them forward on that side: they run for
the hedlyng in to all mischief. As blind guydes of blind men / till that
death set on them unware and till that hit be said unto them that christ says
in the gospel my friend this night y^ deuylles shall take thy soul from the:
these goods then that thou haste gedered whose shall they be. Then shall they
envy the^ whom they despised. Then shall they commend them that they mokked then
shall they coueyte to ensew them in living when they may not: whom when they
might have ensewed they pursewed / stop therefore thyn eres my most dear sone
and what so ever men sey of y^ what so ever men think on y^ account hit for
nothing / but regard only y^ judgment of god which shall yield every man
after his own works when he shall show him self from heaven with y^ angels
of his virtue: in flame of fire doing ve^geau^ce upon them that have not
known god nor obeyed his gospel which (as the apostle seyth) shall suffer in
death eternal peyn. From y^ face of our lord and from the glory of his virtue
when he shall come to be gloryed of his seyntes and to be made merueylous in
all them y^ have believed. Hit is written. Qolite timere qui corpus possunt
occidere sed qui anima^ potest mittere in gehenna^. Fere not the^ (seyth our
lord) that may slethe body: but fere him y^ may cast the soul in to hell.
How much less then be they to be fered: y^ may neither hurt soul nor body
which if they now bakbyte y^ lyunnge virtuously they shall do the same never
the less: if (virtue forsaken) thou were over whelmed with vice not for y^
vice displeases them but for y^ y^ vice of bakbytynge always pleases them flee
if thou love thyn health flee as far as thou may their company / and
retournynge to thy self oftentimes secretly pray unto y^ most benygne father
of heaven cryenge with the prophet. Adtedn^e leuaui animam meam deus meus in te
co^fido non erubescam etia^ si irrideant me inimici mei eteni^ vniuersi qui
sperant in ^e non confunde^r^. Co^fundantur miqua age^tes superuacue. vias tuas
dn^e demo^stra mihi et semitas tuas edoce me. dirige me in veritate tua et doce
me quia tu es deus saluator meus et in te sperabo tota die. That is to say. To
y^ lord I lift up my soul in the I trust I shall not be shamed and though
mine enemies mok me. Certainly all they y^ trust in the shall not be a shamed.
Let them be a shamed that work wyckednes in vain. Thy weyes good lord show
me and thy paths teache me direct me in thy truth and teache me for thou art
god my sauyoure in the shall I trust all the day. Remember also my sone y^ the
death lies at hand. Remember that all the time of our life is but a moment
and yet less than a moment Remember how cursed our old enemy is: which
offers us y^ kingdoms of this world that he might beryue us y^ kingdom of
heaven / how false the flesshly plesures: which therefore embrace us y^ they
might strangle us. how disceyteful these worldly honors: which therefore lift
us up: y^ they might throw us down / how deedly these rychesses: which the
more they feed us: y^ more they poison us / how short how uncertain how
shadow like false ymaginary hit is y^ all these things together may bring
us: and though they flow to us as we would wyssh them. Remember again how
great things be promised and prepared for the^: which ^ispisynge these present
things desire and long for that country whose king is y^ godheed / whose law
is charity / whose mesure is etnite. Occupi thy mind with these meditacyons
and such other y^ may waken the when thou slepest / kyndle y^ when you waxes
cold / co^ferme the when thou wauerest and exhibit y^ whynges of the love of
god while thou laborest to heuenwarde that when thou come home to us (which
with great desire we look for) we may se not only hy^ that we coueyte but also
such a manner one as we coueyte. Fare well and love god whom of old thou have
begone to fere.

The interpretacion of Johan Picus upon this psalm Conserua me domine.
COnserua me dn^e qm^ speraui in te. Dixi domino deus meus es tu qm^ bonorum
meorum no^ eges Sa^ctis q^ sunt in terra mirificauit voluntates suas.
Multiplicate su^t infirmitates postea acceleraueru^t. Non co^gregabo
co^uenticula eorum de sanguinibus: nec memor ero noi^m eoru^ per labia mea.
Dn^s pars hereditatis me and calicis mei: tu es qui restitues hereditatem meam
mihi. Funes ceciderunt mihi in preclaris eteni^ hereditas mea ^clara est mihi.
Ben^dicam du^m qui tribuit mihi intelleccu^ insuper et vsque ad noctem
increpuerunt me renes met. Prouideba^ dnm in conspectu meo semper qm^ a dextris
est mihi ne commouca^ Propter hoc letatum est cor meum et exultauit lingua mea
insuper et caro mea requiescet in spe. Quoniam non derelinques animam meam in
inferno nec dabis sanctu^ tuum videre corruptionem. Notas mihi fecisti vias
vite adunplebis me leticia cum vultu tuo. Delectationes in dextera tua vsque in
finem. Conserua me domine. Keep me good lord. If any perfyte man look upon his
own estate there is one parell therein yt is to wit lest he wax proud of his
virtue and therefore Dauyd spekyng in ye person of a ryghteous man of his estate
begins with these words. Conserua me domine. That is to say keep me good
lord which word keep me: if it be well considered takes away all occasyon
of pride. For he that is able of him self any thing to get: is able of him
self that same thing to keep. He that asks then of god to be kept in the
state of virtue signifies in that asking that from the beginning he got not
that virtue by him self. He then which remembers yt he attained his virtue:
nor by his own power but by the power of god may not be proud thereof but
rather humbled before god after those words of thapostle.

Quid habes quod no^ accepisti. What have thou that thou have not received and
if thou have not received hit: why art thou proud thereof as though thou had
dest not received it. Two words the^ be there which we should ever have in our
mouth: y^ one. Miserere mei deus. Have mercy on me lord when we remember our
vice: that other. Conserua me deus. Keep me good lord when we remember our
virtue.

Quonia^ speraui in te. For I have trusted in ye. This one thing is it that
makes us obtain of god our petycio^ y^ is to wit when we have a full hope
and trust that we shall speed. If we observe these two things in our req^estes
y^ is to wit y^ we require nothing but that which is good for us and y^ we
require hit ardently with a sure hope that god shall here us / our prayers
shall never be void wherefore when we miss the effect of our petycyon either
hit is for y^ we ask such thing as is noyous unto us (for as christ says) we
wot never what we ask and Jesus said what so ever ye shall ask in my name hit
shall be given you. This name Jesus signifies a savior and therefore there is
nothing asked in y^ name of Jesus but that is wholesome and helpyng to the
salvation of the asker) or else god hereth not our prayoure because that
though y^ thing y^ we require be good yet we ask hit not well / for we ask
hit with little hope. And he y^ asks doubtyngely asks coldely and therefore
saint James bids us ask in faith nothing doubtyng. Dixi dno^ deus meus es
tu. I have said to our lord my god art thou. After that he has warded and
fenced him self against pride he descrybeth in these words his estate. All the
estate of a ryghteous man stands in these words. Dixi domino deus meus es
tu. I have said to our lord my god art thou. which words though they seem
comune to all folk yet are there very few y^ may say them truly / that
thing a man takes for his god that he takes for his chyefe good. And that
thing takes he for his chyefe good which only had thought all other things
^ak he thy^keth him self happy and which only lakyng though he have al other
things he thinks him self unhappy. The negard then seyth to his money. Deus
meus es tu. My god art thou. For though honor fail and health and strenghte
and friends so he have money he thinks him self well. And if he have al
those things y^ we have spoken of if money fail. he thinks him self
unhappy. The gloton seyth unto his flesshly lust y^ ambyciouse man leyth to his
vaynglory my god art thou. Se than how few may trewly sey these words I have
said to our lord my god art thou. For only he may trewly say it which
is content with god alone: so y^ if there were offered him all the kingdoms of
the world and all the good that is in earth and all the good that is in heaven
he would not ones offend god to have them all. In these words than / I have
said to our lord my god art thou / stands all the state of a right wise man.
Quonia^ bonorum meorum non eges. For thou have no need of my good in these
words he shows y^ cause why he says only to our lord. Deus meus es tu. My
god art thou the cause is for that only our lord has no need of our good.
There is no creature but y^ it needs other creatures and though they be of
less perfeccyon than hit self as philosophers and diuynes prouen: for if
these more imperfyte creatures were not / y^ other that are more parfyte could
not be. For if any part of y^ hole university of creatures were distroyed and
fallen to naught all the hole were subverted. For certainly one part of that
vniuersyte perisshyng all parties perissh and all creatures be partis to y^
vniuersyte of which university god is no part but he is the beginning nothing
there upon dependynge. For nothing truly wanne he by y^ creacyon of this
world nor nothing should he lose if the world were adnychylate and turned to
naught again. Than only god is he which has no need of our good / well
ought we certainly to be a shamed to take such thing for god as has need of
us / and such is every creature. Moreover we should not accept for god y^ is to
say for the chyefe goodness but only y^ thing which is the most sovereign
goodness of all things and that is not the goodness of any creature / only
therefore to our lord ought we to say my god art thou. Sanctis qui sunt in
terra eius mirificauit voluntares suas. To his saints that are in y^ land of
him he has made marvelous his wills. After god should we specially love them
which are nerest joined unto god as be the holy aungelles and blyssed saints
that are in their country of heaven therefore after that he had said to our
lord my god art thou he adds thereunto that our lord has made marvelous
his wylles y^ is to say he has made marvelous his loves and his desires
toward his seyntes that are in the land of him that is to wit in the
country of heaven which is called y^ land of god and the land of living
people. And verily if we inwardly co^sydre how great is the felicite of that
country and how much is y^ misery of this world how great is y^ goodness and
charity of those blessed citezyns: we shall continually desire to be hens that
we were there. These things and such other wha^ we remember we should ever more
take heed y^ our meditacions be not vnfruytfull but that of every meditacyon we
should always purchase one virtue or other / as for ensample by this meditacyon
of the goodness of that heavenly country we should win this virtue that we
should not only strongly suffer death and pacyently when our time comes or if
hit were put unto us for y^ faith of christ: vut also we should wyllyngely and
gladly long therefore desiring to be departed out of this vale of wretchydnes
y^ we may reygne in y^ heavenly country with god and his holy saints.
Multiplicate sunt infirmitates eorum postea acceleraueru^t. Their infyrmytees
be multyplyed and after they hasted. These words the prophet speaks of
wicked men. By infyrmytees he understands Idols and so hit is in y^ hebriew
text. For as good folk have but one god whom they worship so evil folk have
many gods and Idols for they have many voluptuouse pleasurs many vain
desires many diverse passions which they serve / and wherefore seek they many
sundry pleasures? certainly for by cause they can find none y^ can set their
heart at rest and for y^ (as y^ prophet says) wicked men walk about in a
circuet or co^pace whereof there is none end Now after these words: their
Idols be multiplied hit follows. After they hasted y^ is to say: after their
Idols after their passions and beestly desires they ro^^e forth hedlynge
unadvisedly without any consideracyon. And in this be we taught that we should as
spedely run to virtue as they ro^ne to vice and y^ we should with no less
dylygence serve our lord god than they serve their lord y^ devil. The just
man co^syderyng y^ estate of evil folk determines fermly with him self (as we
should also) that utterly he will in no wise follow them and therefore he says.
Non congregabo conuenticula^ eorum de sanguinibus nec memor nominum. I shall
not gather the co^gregacyon of them from the blood nor I shall not remember
their names he says from the blood both because Idolatres were wont to gather
the blood of their sacrefyce together and theraboute to do their serymonyes.
And also for that all the life of evil men forsaken reason which stondeth all
in the soul and folowen sensualyte that stondeth all in y^ blood / the
prophet says not ouely that he will not gather their co^gregacyon together
from ye blood that is to say y^ he would do no sacrefyce to those Idols but
also that he would not remember their names that is to say that he would not
talk nor speak of y^ voluptuouse delytes which are evil peoples gods
which we might yet lawfully do: showing us by y^: that a parfyte man should
abstain not onley from unlawful pleasures but also from lawful / to the end
y^ he may all together hole have his mind in to heaven ward and the more
purely entende unto the contemplacion of heavenly things. And for as much as
some man would peradventure think y^ hit were folly for a man utterly to
depryue him self from all pleasures therefore y^ prophet adds. Dn^s pars
hereditates me. Our lord is ye part of mine enheretaunce / as though he would
say marvel the not though I forsake all thing to thentent y^ I may have y^
possessyon of god in whom al other things also be possessed. This should be the
voice of every good christen man. Dn^s pars hereditatis me. God is the part
of mine enheretau^ce. For certainly we christen people to whom god is promised
for an enheretau^ce ought to be a shamed to desire any thing beside him. But
for y^ some man might happily repute hit for a great ^sumpcion y^ a man should
promise himself god for his enherytaunce therefore y^ prophet puts thereto.
Tu es qui restitues hereditatem meam michi. Thou good lord art he that shall
restore mine enherytaunce unto me. As though he would say. O good lord my god
I know well that I am nothing in respect of y^ I wot well I am unable to
assende by mine own strength / so high / to have y^ in possessyon but thou
art he y^ shall draw me to the by thy grace thou art he that shalt give thy
self in possession unto me. Let a ryghteous man then consydre how great a
felicite hit is to have god fall unto him as his enherytaunce hit follows in
the psalm. Eunes ceciderunt michi in preclaris. The cords have fall to me
nobly. The parts and lottes of enherytaunces were of old time met out and
dyuyded by cords or ropes. These words then the ropes or cords have fallen
to me nobly be asmoche to say as the part of lot of mine enherytau^ce is
noble. But for as much as there be many men which though they be called to
this great felycite (as in deed all christen people are) yet they set little
thereby and often times change hit for a small simple delight therefore y^
prophet says suyngly. Hereditas me^ ^clara est michi. Mine enheritau^ce is
noble to me. As though he would say that as hit is noble in hit self so hit is
noble to me that is to say I reputed hit noble. And all other things in
respect of hit / I repute (as saint Paul says / for donge / but for as much
as to have this light of understanding whereby a man may know this gift that
is given him of god to be the gift of god / therefore the prophet suyngely
says. Bu^dicam dn^m qui tribuit intellectu^. That is to say I shall bliss
our lord which has given me under stondinge but in so much as a man
ofte^tymes entendeth after reason to serve god and y^ notwithstondyng yet
sensualite and the flessh repugneth: than is a man perfyte when y^ not his
soul only but also his flessh draw forth to godwarde after those words of
the prophet in an other psalm. Cor meu^ and caro mea exultaueru^t i^ deu^
viuu^. That is to say my mind and my flesh both have ioyed in to living
god and for this the prophet says here suyngely. ^t vsque ad nocte^ mere
pueru^t me renes mei. My reins or kidney has chyden me unto the night: that
is to say my reins in which is wont to be the gretest inclinacyon to
concupiscence not only now enclyne me not to sin but also chydeth me that
is to say withdraw me fro sin unto the night that is to say they so
fersorth withdraw me from syn^e that wyllyngly that afflyet and pain my body.
Afflyccyo^ is in scripture oftentimes signified by the night because hit is the
most dysco^fortable season. Then suyngly the prophet shows what is y^ rote
of this priuacion or taking away of flesshly concupiscence in a man saying.
Prouideba^ deu^ sem per in ^spectu meo. I provided god always before me sight /
for if a man had god always before this eyes as a ruler of all his works and
in all his works he should neither seek his own lucre his glory nor his own
pleasure but only to y^ pleasure of god he should shortly be perfyte. And for
as much as he y^ so does prospers in all thing therefore it follows. Ipse a
dextris est mihi ne co^mouear. He is on my right hand that I be not moved or
troubled. Then the prophet declares how great is ye felycite of a just man
which shall be euerlastyngly blyssed both in body and in soul and therefore
he says. Letatum est cor meum. My soul is glad knowing yt after death heaven is
made ready for him. ^t caro mea requiescet in spe and my flesh shall rest in
hope that is to say that though it joy not by and by as in receyuynge his
glorious estate medyatly after the death yet hit rests in the sepulcre with
this hope that hit shall arise in the day of Judgment unmortall and shynynge
with his soul. And also the prophet more expressly declares in the verse
following. For where he said thus my soul is glad he adds the cause saying.
Quoniam non derelinques animam in inferno. For thou shall not leave my soul in
hell. Also where the prophet said that his flessh should rest in hope he
shows the cause saying. Q^^ dabis sanctum tuum videre corruptionem.

Nor thou shalt not suffer thy saint to se corrupcyon that is to say thou
shalt not suffer y^ flesh of a good man to be corrupted. For that that was
corruptyble shall arise incorruptible. And for as much as christ was the first
which entered paradise and opened the life unto us and was the first that rose
again and the cause of our resurreccyon: therefore these words that we have
spoken of the resurreccyon ben pryncipally vnderstonden of christ as saint
peter y^ apostle has declared / and secondaryly they may be vnderstonden of us
in y^ we be the me^bres of christ which only never saw corrupcyon for his
holy body was in his sepulcre nothing putrified / for asmoche the^ as y^ way of
good living brings us to a perpetual life of soul and body therefore y^
prophet says. Qotas michi fecisti vias vite. Thou have made the ways of life
known unto me and because that all the felycyte of that stondeth in the clear
beholdynge and ftuycion of god / therefore hit follows. Adimplebis meleticus
cum vultu tuo. Thou shall fill me full of gladness with the chere and for that
our felicite shall be everlasting therefore he says. Delectationes in dextra
tua vsque in fine^. Delectacion and Joy shall be on thy right hand for ever:
he says on thy right hand because y^ our felycite is fulfilled in the bysyon
and fruytion of the humanyte of christ which sytteth in heaven on ye right hand
of his fathers majesty / after y^ words of saint Johan. He est tota merces vt
videamus deu^ quem misisti Iesum christum. That is all our reward that we
may be hold god and Jesus christ whom thou have sent: to which reward he
bring us that sytteth there and prays for us. Amen.

Here begin.xij. rules of Johan Picus earl of Myrandula partly excytyng
partly dytectynge a man in spyrytuall battle.
WHo so to virtue estemeth the way
Because we must have war contynuall
Against ye world / ye flessh / ye devil / that aye
Enforce them self to make us bond and thrall
Let him remember that chese what way he shall
Even after the world / yet must he need susteyn
Sorrow / aduersite / labor / greyfe / and pain.
The second rule.
Think in this wretched worlds besy woo
The battle more sharp and longer is Iwys
With more labor and less fruit also
In which the end of labor: labor is
And when the world has left us after this
Uoyde of all virtue: the reward when we dye
Is naught but fire and pain perpetually
The third rule.
Consydre well that folly it is and vain
To look for heaven with pleasure and delyght
Since christ our lord and souereyne captain
Ascended never but by manly fight
And bitter passion / then were it no right
That any servant / ye will your self record
Should stand in better condicyon then his lord
The fourth rule.
Think how that we not only should not grudge
But eke be glad and joyful of this fight
And long therefore all though we could not Judge
How that thereby redounde unto us might
Any profit but only for delyght
To be confourmed and like in some behauour
To Jesus Christ our blessed lord and sauyoure
As often as thou do war and strive.
By the resystence of any sinful mocyon
Against any of thy sensual wits five
Cast in thy mind as often with good devotion
How thou resemblest christ / as with sour pocyon
If thou pain thy taste: remember therwithall
How christ for the tasted eysell and gall
If thou withdraw thyn hands and forbere
The raven of any thing: remember than
How his innocent hands nailed were
If thou be tempte with pride: think how that when
He was in form of god: yet of a bond man
He took the shap and humbled him self for the
To the most odiouse and vile death of a tree.
Consydre when thou art moved to be wroth
He who that was god / and of all men the best
Seeing him self scorned scorged both
And as a thief between.ij. thieves threst
With all rebuke and shame: yet from his breast
Came never sign of wrath or of disdain
But pacyently endured all the pain.
Thus every snare and engyne of the devil
If thou this wise peruse them by and by
There can be none so cursed or so evil
But to some virtue thou may it apply
For often thou shall: resystyng valyauntly
The fendes might and socle fyery datte
Our ^auyour christ resemble in some part
The fyft rule.
Remember well that we in no wise must
Neither in the foresaid espyrytuell armoure
Nor any other remedy put out trust
But ouely in the virtue strength of our savior
For he it is by whose mighty power
The world was veynquyisshed and his prince cast out
Which reigned before in all the et the about
In him let us trust to overcome all evil
In him let us put our hope and confydence
To ^uddene^ he flesh and master y^ devil
To him be all honor and lowly reverence
Often should we require with all our dyligence
With prayer / with teeres / and lamentable playntes
The aid of his grace and his holy saints
The syxte rule.
One sin vaynquysshed look thou not tarry
But lie in a wait for an other every hour
For as a wood iyon the fend our aduersarye
Rynneth about seeking whom he may devour
Wherefore contynually upon thy tower
Lest he the unpurveyed and unready catch
Thou must with the prophcie stand and keep watch
The.vii. rule
Enforce thy self not only for to stand
Unuayn^uysshed against the deuyls might
But over that take valyauntly on hand
To vaynquysshe him and put him unto flight
And that is when of y^ same deed thought or sight
By which he would have the with sin contract:
Thou take occasyon of some good virtuous act.
Some time he secretly castyth in thy mind
Some lawdable deed to stere the to pride
As vayn glory makyth many a man blind
But let humylite be thy sure guide
Thy good wark to god let hit be applyede
Think hit not thyn but a gift of his
Of whose grace undoubtedly all goodness is
The viii. rule
In time of battle so put thy self in preace
As though thou should after that victory
Enjoy for ever a perpetual peace
For god of his goodness and lyberall mercy
May grant the gift / and eke thy proud enemy
Confounded and rebuked by thy battle
Shall the no more happily for very shame assail
But when thou may ones y^ triumph obtain
Prepare thy self and trymme the in thy gere
As thou sholdest incontinent fight again
For if thou be ready the devil will the fere
Wherefore in any wise so even thou the bear
That thou remember and have ever in memory.
In victory battle in battle victory
If thou think thy self well fenced and sure
Against every sotell suggestion of vice
Consydre frail glass may no dystres endure
And great adventurers often curs the dyce
Ieopard not to far therefore and ye be wise
But evermore eschew the occasyons of sin
For he that loves parell shall peressh therein
The.x. rule.
In all temptacyon withstonde the beginning
The cursed infantes of wretched Babylon
To suffer them wax / is a Ieoperdous thing
Beat out their brains therefore at the stone
Perylous is the canker that catches the bone
To late comes the medicine if thou let the ^ore
By long contynuaunce increase more and more.
The.xj. rule.
Though in the time of the battle and war
The conflecte seem bitter sharp and sour
Yet consydre hit is more pleasure far
Over the devil to be a conqueroure
Then is in the use of thy beestly pleasoure
Of virtue more joy the conscience has within
Then outward the body of all his fylthy sin
In this p^ynt many men err for necligence
For they compare not the Joy of the vyctory
To the sensual pleasure of their concupiscence
But like rude beestes unadvisedly
Lakkynge discrecyon they compare and apply
Of their foul sin the voluptuouse delyght
To the laberous travail of the conflyct and fight
And yet alas he that often has known
What gryefe it is by long experyence
Of his cruel enemy to be over thrown
Should ones at the lest wise do his diligence
To prove and assaye with manly defense
What pleasure there is what honor peace and rest
In gloriouse victory tryumphe and conquest
The.xij. rule.
Though thou be tempted despair the nothing
Remember the glorious apostle saint Poule
When he had seen god in his perfyte being
Lest such reuelacyon should his heart extolle
His flesh was suffered rebel against the soul
This did almighty god of his goodness provide
To preserve his servant fro y^ danger of pride
And here take heed that he whom god did love
And for his most especial vessel chose
Rauysshed in to the third heaven above
Yet stood in peril lest pride might him depose
Well ought we then our hertes fence and close
Against vaynglorye the mother of repryefe
The very crop and rote of all myschefe
Against this pomp and wretched worlds gloss
Consydre how crist the lord souereyne powere
Humbled him self for us unto the cross
And peradventure death with in one hour
Shall us bereue: wealth riches and honowre
And bring us down full low both small and great
To vile caryon and wretched worms mete
Here follow the.xii. wepens of spirytual battle which every man should have at
hand when ye pleasure of a synful temptacyon comes to his mind.

The pleasure little and short The folowers gryef and heaviness The loss of a
bettyr thing This life a dreme and a shadow The death at out hand and unware ye
fere of i^penite^t depertyng Eternal joy etnal pain y^ nature and dygnyte of
man ye peace of a good mind The great vn^fytes of god The peynful cross of christ
The wytnes of martyrs and example of saints.
The.xii. wepens have we more at lengh declared as hit folowyth.

The pleasure little and short
Consydre well the pleasure that thou have
Stand hit in towchyng or in wanton sight
In vain smell or in thy lycorouse taste
Or finally in what so ever delyght
Occupied is thy wretched appetyght
Thou shall hit find when thou have al cast
Little / simple / short / and suddenly past
The folowers gryefe and heaviness
Any good wark if thou iwth labor do
The labor goth / the goodness does remain
If thou do evil with pleasure joined thereto
The pleasure which thine evil wark does co^tayne
Glydeth his wey thou mast him not restrain
The evil then in thy breast cleueth behind
With grudge of heart and heaviness of mind
The loss of a better thing.
When thou laborest thy pleasure for to bye
Upon the price look thou the well advise
Thou sellest thy soul therefore even by and by
To thy most vttre dispitcouse enemies
O mad merchaunt o folissh merchaundyse
To by a tryfle / o chyldysshe reckoning
And pay therefore so dear a precyouse thing
This life a dreme and a shadow
This wretched life (the trust and confidence
Of whose contynuaunce makes us bold to sin)
Thou perceiuest well by experience
Since that hour in wiche hit did begin
Hit holds on the course and will not lynne
But fast hit rynneth on and passen shall
As does a dreme or a sadowe on the wall
Death at our hand and unware
Consydre well that ever night and day
While that we besyly provide and care
For our disport revel mirth and play
For plesaunt melody and deynty fare
Death stelyth on full ^yly and unware
He lies at hand and shall us entreprise
We not how soon nor in what manner wise
Fere of impenitent departing
If thou sholdest god offend think how therefore
Thou were forthwith in very Ieoperdous case
For happily thou should not live an hour more
Thy sin to cleanse / and thought thou had space.
Yet peradventure sholdest thou lack the grace
Well ought we then be a ferde to done offense
Impenitent lest we departen hens
Eternal reward eternal pain
Thou see this world is but a thorowfare
Se thou behave the wisely with thy host
Hens must thou needs depart naked and bare
And after thy deserte look to what coost
Thou art conuayed at such time as thy ghost
From this wretched carkas shall dysseuer
Be hit Joy or pain / endure hit thou shall for ever.
The nature and dygnite of man
Remember how god has made the reasonable
Like unto his Image and figure
And for the suffered pains intolerable
That he for angel never would endure
Regard o man thine excellent nature
Thou that with angel art made to been egall
For very shame be not the deuyllles thrall.
The peace of a good mind.
Why love thou so this brotle worlds Joy
Take all the mirth take all the fantasies
Take every game / take every wanton ^oye
Take every sport that men can the deuyse
And among them all on warantyse
Thou shall no pleasure comparable find
To thynwarde gladness of a virtuous mind
The great benefyces of god.
By side that god the bought and fourmed both
Many a benefyte have thou received of his
Though thou have moved him often to be wroth
Yet he the kept has and brought us up to this
And daily calls upon the to his blys
How may thou then to him vnlouynge be
That ever has been so loving unto the.
The paynfull cross of christ.
When thou in flame of the temptacyon fryest
Think on the very lamentable pain
Think on the pyteouse cross of woeful christ
think on his blood vet out at every vain
Think on his precious heart kerued in twain
Think how for thy redempcyon all was wrought
Let him not lose that he so dear has bought
The wytnes of martyrs and example of saints
Sin to withstonde say not thou lakkest might
Such allegacyons folly hit is to use
The wytnes of saints and martyrs constant fight
Shall the of slothful cowardyse accuse
God will the help if thou do not refuse
If other have stand or this: thou may eft soon
Nothing impossible is that has been done
The.xij. propertees or co^dicyons of a lover
To love one alone and contempne all other for yt one

To think him unhappy that is not with his love

To adourne him self for the pleasure of his love

To suffer all thing though hit were death to be with his love

To desire also to suffer shame harm for his love and to think that hurt
sweet

To be with his love ever as he may if not in deed yet in thought

To love all thing yt perteyneth unto his love

To coueite the praise of his love and not to suffer any dysprayse

To believe of his love all things excellent and to desire that all folk
should think the same

To weep often with his love: in presence for Joy in absence for sorrow

To languysshe ever and ever to burn in the desire of his love.

To serve his love nothing thinking of any reward or profit.

The.xij. propertees we have at length more openly expressed in balade as hit
follows.

THe first point is to love but one alone
And for that one all other to forsake
For who so loves many loves none
The flode that is in many chanelles take
In each of them shall feeble stremes make
The love that is divided among many
Unneth suffyseth that any part have any
So thou that have thy love set unto god
In thy remembrance this enprynt and grave
As he in sovereign dignyte is odd
So will he in love no partynge fellows have
Love him therefore with all that he the gave
For body / soul wit / co^nynge / mind and thought
Part will he none but either all or naught
The second properte.
Of his love lo the sight and company
To the lover so glad and pleasant is
That who so has the grace to come thereby
He judges him in perfyte Joy and blys
And who so of that company does mysse
Live he in never so prosperous estate
He thinks him wretched and unfortunate
So should the lover of god esteem that he
which all the pleasure has / mirth and disporte
That in this world is possible to be
Yet till the time that he may ones resort
Unto that blyssed to joyful heavenly port
Where he of god may have the glorious sight
Is void of parfyte joy and delyght
The third properte.
The third point of a parfyte lover is
To make him fresshe to se that all thing been
Appointed well and nothing set a mys
But all well fasshoned / propre / goodly / and clean
That in his parsone there be nothing seen
In speech / apparayll / gesture / look or pace
That may offend or mynysshe any grace
So thou that will with god get in to favor
Garnysshe thy self up in as goodly wise
As comely be as honest in behauoure
As hit is possible for the to deuyse
I mean not hereby that thou sholdest arise
And in the glass upon thy body prowle
But with fair virtue to adourne thy ^oule
The fourth properte.
If love be strong / hot / mighty / and fervent
There may no trouble greyfe or sorrow fall
But that the lover would be well content
All to endure and think hit eke to small
Though hit were death so he might therwithall
The joyful presence of that person get
On whom he has his heart and love I set
Thus should of god the lover be content
Any dystres or sorrow to endure
Rather then to be from god absent
And glad to dye so that he may be sure
By his departing hens for to procure
After this valey dark / the heavenly / light
And of his love the gloryouse blessed sight
The fyft properte.
Not only a lover content is in his heart
But coueyteth eke and longs to sustain
Some labor incommodite or smarte
Loss aduersyte / trouble / greyfe or pain
And of his sorrow Joyful is and feign
And happy thinks him self that he may take
Some mysaduenture for his lovers sake
Thus sholdest thou that love god also
In thine heart wysshe / coueyte and be glad
For him to suffer trouble pain and woo
For whom if thou be never so woo bestade
yet thou ne shall sustain (be not adrad)
Half the dolor gryefe and aduersyte
That he all ready suffered has for the
The.vi. properte.
The parfyte lover longs for to be
In presence of his love both night and day
And if hit happily so be fall that he
May not as he would: he will yet as he may
Ever be with his love that is to say
where his heavy nyl be brought
He will be conuersaunt in mind and thought
Lo in like manner the lover of god should
At the lest in such wise as he may
If he may not in such wise as he would
Be present with god and conuersaunt always
For certes who ^o list he may puruey
Though al y^ world would him therfro beryuen
To bear his body in earth his mind in heaven
The.vii. properte
There is no page or servant most or lest
That does upon his love attend and wait
There is no little worm no simple best
Ne none so small a tryfle or conceyte
Lase / gyrdell / point / or propre glove strayte
But that if to his love hit have been nere
The lover has hit precious / leyfe / and dear
So every relyque Image or pycture
That does pertayne to gods magnyfycence
The lover of god should with all besy cure
Have hit in love honor and reverence
And specially give them preemynence
which daily done his blessed body wyrche
The quyk relyques the mynystres of his church
The.viii. properte
A very lover above all erthly thing
Coueyteth and longs evermore to here
Thonoure lawde commendacyon and praysyng
And every thing that may the fame clear
Of this love / he may in no manner
Endure to here that ther^fro myghten vary
Or any thing sown in to the contrary
The lover of god should coueyte in like wise
To here his honor worship laud and praise
whose souereygne goodness none heart may co^pryse
whom hell / earth / and all the heaven obayse
Whose parfyte lover ought by no manner ways
To suffer the cursed words of blasphemy
Or any thing spoken of god irreverently
The.ix. properte.
A very lover believes in his mind
On whom so ever he has his heart I bent
That in that person men may nothing find
But honorable worthy and excellent
And eke surmountynge far in his intent
All other that he has known by sight or name
And would that every man should think the same
Of god like wise so wonderful and hye
All thing esteem and judge his lover ought
So reverence worship honor and magnyfye
That all the creatures in this world I wrought
In comparyson should he set at naught
And glad be if he might the mean deuyse
That all the world would thynken in like wise
The.x. properte
The lover is of color deed and pale
There will no sleep in to his eyes stalk
He sauoreth neither mete / wine / nor ale
He myndeth not what men about him talk
But etc he drink he sit lie down or walk
He burns ever as hit were with a fire
In the fervent hete of his desire
Here should the lover of god ensample take
To have him contynually in remembrance
With him in prayer and medytacyon wake
While other play / revel / sing / and dance
None erthly Joy / disport / or vain plesaunce
Sold him delight or any thing remove
His ardent mind from god his heuynly love
The.xi. properte.
Dyuersly passyoned is the lovers heart
Now plesaunt hope now dread and grievous fere
Now parfyte bliss now bitter sorrow smarte
And whether his love be with him or else where
Often from his eyes there falls many a tere
For very Joy / when they together be
When they be sondred: for aduersyte.
Like affeccyons feleth eke the breast
Of gods lover in prayer and meditacyon
When that his love lyketh in him rest
With inward gladness of pleasant co^templacyon
Out break the teres for Igye and delectacyon
And when his love list efte to part him fro
Out break the teres again for pain and woo
The.xii. properte.
A very lover will his love obaye
His Joy it is and all his appetyght
To pain him self in all that ever he may
That parsone in whom he set has his delyght
Dylygent to serve both day and night
For very love / without any regard
To any profit gwerdon or reward
So thou like wise that have thine heart I set
Upwarde to god so well thy self endeuere
So studyously that nothing may the let
Not for his service any wise disseuere
Freely look eke thou serve that thereto never
Trust of reward or profit do the bind
But only faithful heart and loving mind
wageles to serve.iij. things may us move
First if the service self be desyrable
Second if they whom that we serve and love
Be very good and very amyable
Thyrdely of reason be we seruysable
Without the gapynge after any more
To such as have done much for us before
Serve god for love then / not for hope of mede
What service may so desyrable be
As where all turns to thine own speed
Who is so good so lovely eke as he
Who has all ready done so much for the
As he that first the made: and on the rode
Eft the redeemed with his precious blood
A prayer of Picus Mirandula unto god
O holy god of dredefull magestee
Uerely one in.iij. and three in one
Whom aungelles serve whose werk all creatures be
Which heaven and earth directest all alone
We the beseech good lord with woeful moan
Spare us wretches and wasshe away our gylt
That we be not by thy just anger spylt
In stray^ balance of rygorous judgment
If thou sholdest our sin pondre and wey
Who able were to bear thy punysshment
The hole engyne of all this world I say
The engyne that enduren shall for aye
With such examynacyon might not stand
Space of a moment in thine angry hand
Who is not borne in sin original
Who does actual sin in sundry wise
But thou good lord art he that sparest all
With pyteouse mercy temperynge justice
For as thou do rewards us deuyce
Above our merit / so do thou dispense
Thy punysshement far under our offense
More is thy mercy far then all our sin
To give them also that unworthy be
More godly is and more mercy therein
Howbehit: worthy Enough are they perdee
Be they never so unworthy: whom that he
List to accept where so ever he takes
Whom he unworthy fyndeth worthy makes
Wherefore good lord that aye merciful art
Unto thy grace and sovereign dygnyte
We sely wretches cry with humble heart
Our sins forget and our malygnite
With pyteous eyes of thy benygnyte
Friendly look on us ones thine own
Servants or sinners whether hit lyketh the
Sinners if thou our crime behold certain
Our crime the warke of our vncorteyse mind
But if thy gifts thou behold again
Thy gifts noble wonderful and kind
Thou shalt us then the same persons find
Which are to the and have be long space
Servants by nature children by thy grace
But this thy goodness wryngeth us alas
For we whom grace had made thy children dear
Are made thy gylty folk by our trespace
Sin has us gylty made this many a year
But let thy grace / thy grace that has no pere
Of our offense surmounten all the preace
That in our sin thine honor may encreace
For though thy wisdom / though thy souerayn power
May other wise appear suffycyently
As things which thy creatures every hour
All with one voice declare and testyfye
Thy goodness: yet thy synguler mercy
Thy pyteous heart thy garcyous indulgence
Nothing so clearly shows as our offense
What but our sin has showed that mighty love:
Which able was thy dreadful magestee
To draw down in to earth fro heaven above
And crucyfye god / that we poor wretches we
Should from our fylthy sin I cleansed be
With blood and water of thine own side
That stremed from thy blyssed wounds wide
Thy love and pity thus o heavenly king
Our evil makes: matter of thy goodness
O love o pity our wealth ay prouydynge
O goodness seruyng thy servants in distres
O love o pity well nygh now thankles
O goodness mighty gracyous and wise
And yet almost now vaynquysshed with our vice
Grant I the pray such hete in to mine heart
That to this love of thine may be egall
Grant me fro sathanas service to astert
With whom me rueth so long to be thrall
Grant me good lord and creator of all
The flame to quench of all sinful desire
And in thy love set all mine heart a fire
That when the iournay of this deedly life
My sely ghost has fynysshed and thense
Departen must: without his flesshly wife
Alone in to his lords high presence
He may the find: o well of indulgence
In thy lordeshyp not as a lord: but rather
As a very tender loving father.
Amen.
