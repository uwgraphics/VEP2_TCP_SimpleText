Quhilk fyxit hes their heart, and hole intentis
On Sensual Lust, on Dignity, and Rentis.

And als our Queen, of Scotland Heretour

And far langar, or that oung tender flour
Bring home till ws, ane King and Governor,
Allace tharefor, we may with sorrow sing
Quhilk most so lang, remane without one king

With Cunnyg Men, from time that you be kende
Thy Vaniteis, no way they will advance
Thynkand the proud, sic thyngis to pretend
Nochtwithstanding, ye straucht way sal you wend
To them, quhilk was the realm in governance
Declare thy mind to them, with circumstance
Go first till James, our Prince, and Protector
And his Brother, our Spiritual Governor
And Prince of Preistis, in this Natioun.
After Reverend Recommendatioun
Under their feit, thou lawlye the submyt
And make them humyll supplicatioun
Give they in the, find wrang Narratioun
That they wald pleis, thy faltis to remyt
And of their grace, give they do the admyt
Than go thy way, quhare ever thou plesis best
Be they content, make reverence to the rest.

Quhow Mankind been, to misery maid thrall
At lenth to them, the cause planelie confess
Beseikand them, all lawis to suppress

Contrar to Christis Institutioun.
And cause them cleirlye, for till understand
That for the brekyng of, the Lords command

Be mortal weris, both be sey and land
With money terrabyll trybulatioun

Bot all were brynt, for their offentioun

Off Princis, Prelates, with money ane man and wyue
Expel the cause, than the effect belyue

Than God sall slak his bow, quhilk it is bent.
Make thaim requeist, quhilk hes the Governance
The Sinceir word of God for till Auance
Conform to Christis Institutioun
Without Ypocrisie, or dissimulance
Causyng Justice, hauld ewinlye the Balance
On Publicanis, making punyssioun
Commendyng them, of good conditioun
That being done, I dout nocht bot the Lord

Declare to them, they sall have merry dayis
After this trubyll, as the Propheit sayis
Quhen God sall se, our humyll Repentence
Till strange pepyll, thoucht he hes geuin license
To be our scurge, Induryng his desire
Will quhen he list, that Scurge cast in the fire
Pray them, that they putt nocht their esperance
In mortal Men, only them till advance
Bot principallye in God Omnipotent Psalm.c. xvii.

Than neid thai not, to charge ye realm of France
With Gounnis, Galayis, nor other Ordinance
So that they be, to God Obedient
In their premyssis, be they nocht negligent
Displayand Christis Banar, hie on heycht

And give they be, in any way offendit

Or quhov Phoebus that king etheriall.

And in his presens, waxit dirk, and paill

With continual cairfull calamiteis.
Consisting in this wracheit vaill of sorrow.

With roustye terms tharefor will I write
With sorrowful seychis ascending from ye spleen
And bitter teris, distellyng from mine eine.
Without any vain inuocatioun.

Nor itt will I make supplicatioun

And rycht so Ewterp, Jupiter, and Juno.

Quharefor because I am nocht one of tho

For I did never sleip on Pernaso

And specially the ornate Ennius
Nor drank I never with Hysiodus.
Off Greece, the perfyte poet souerane.

Quharefor I awe to them no reverence
I purpose nocht to make obedience
To sic mischeand Musis, nor malmontrye

QVHEN God had maid ye heuini^s brycht
The Sone, and Moan, for to give lycht
The sterry heuin, and Christellyne
And be his Sapience divine Genesis i.

The planetes in yair circlis round
Quhirling about with merry sound
Off quhome Phoebus, was principal
Just in his Line Eclipticall
And gave be Divine Sapience
Till every Ster their Influence
With motioun continual
Quhilk doith endure perpetual
And farrest from the heuin Impyre
The earth, the walter, air, and fire
He cled the earth, with herbis, and treis
All kind of fysches in the seis
All kind of best, he did prepair
With fowlis, fleyng in the air
Thus be his word, all thing was wrocht
Without material maid of nocht
So be his wisdom Infinyte
All was maid plesand and perfyte,
Quhen heuin, and earth, and their contentis
Were endit with their Ornamentis
Than last of all, the Lord began
Off most vile earth, to make the man
Nocht of the Lille, nor the Rose
Nor Sypertre, as I suppose
Another of gold, nor precious stonis
Off earth he maid flesche blude and bonis
To that intent, God maid him thus
That man sulde nocht be glorious
Nor in him self, no thing should se
Bot matere of humylite
Quhen man was maid, as I have tald
Gene. ii.
God in his face, did him behald
Brathand in him, ane lyflie spreit
Quhen all their werkis were compleit
He maid man, to his simylitude
Precelland in to pulchritude
Dotit with gyftis of Nature
Above all erthlye creature
Syne plesandlye did him conuoye
To ane regioun repleit with Joy
Off all plesour, quhilk bair the price
And callit erthly Paradyce
And brocht be Divine prouience
All beistis, and byrdis, till his presence
Adam did craftelye Impone
Ane special name, till every one
And to all thyngis material
He namyt them in special
Quhow he them namyt itt been kend
And salbe to the warldlis end
In to that gardyng of plesance
Two treis grew, most till auance
Above all other, quhilk bair the price
In myddis of that Paradyce
The one was callit the tree of life
The other tree, began our strife
The tree to know boith good and evil
Quhilk be perswatioun of the Devil
Began our misarie and woe
Bot lat ws to our purpose go.
Quhow God gave Adam strait comma^de
That tree to twyche, nocht with his hand
All other fructis of Paradyce
He had him eit at his deuyce
Sayand gyf thou eit of this tree
With dowbyll deith, than sall thou dee
Tharefore I the command be war
And from this tree, thou stand afar
itt Father Adam was allone
But cumpanye of any one
Than thocht the Lord, it Necessare
Till him to Creat ane helpare
God patt in Adam sic Sapour
That for to sleip, he tuke plesour
And laid him down apone the ground
And quhen Adam was slepand sound
He tuke ane Rib, forth of his side
Syne fyld it up, with flesche and hyde
And maid ane Woman of that bone
Fairar of form, was never none
Than till Adam Incontinent
That fair Lady, he did present
Quhilk schortlye said, for to conclude
Thou art my flesche, my bonis, and blude
And Virago, he callit her than
Quhilk is Interpreit, maid of man
Quhilk Eua, efterwart was namyt
Quhen for her falt, sche was diffamyt
Than did the Lord them Sanctyfie
Saying Incres, and Multyplie
Be this, men should leif all their kyn
And with their Wyffis make dwellyn
And for their saik, leif Father and Mother
And lufe them best, above all other
For God hes ordanit them trewlye
To be two saulis, in one body
My wytt is waik, for till Indyte
Their heuinlye plesouris Infinyte
Was never none, erthlye Creature
Sen syne had sic perfyte plesoure
They had puyssance Imperial
Above all thing material
Als cunnyng Clerkis, dois conclude
Adam preceld, in pulchritude
Most Natural and the farest man
That euir was sen the world began
Cxcept Christ Jesus, Goddis Son
To quhome was no comparisone
And Eua, the fairest Creature
That ever was formit be nature
Thocht they were naikit, as they were maid
No schame ather, of other haid
Quhat plesour mycht ane man haif more
Nor haif his Lady him before
So lustye, plesand, and perfyte
Reddy to serve his appetyte
They had none other cure I wys
Bot past their time, with Joy and blys
Wyld Beistis, did to them repair
So did the Fowlis of the air
With noyis most Angelycall
Makand them myrthis Musical
The fyschis soumand in the strandis
Were holelye at their commandis
All Creatures with ane accord
Obeyit him, as their souerane Lord
They sufferit another heit, nor called
With every plesour that they wald
Als to the deith, they were nocht thrall
And rychtso should we have been all
For he and all his Successouris
Should have possedit those plesouris
Syne from that Joy material
Gone to the glore Imperial
They had give I can rycht discryue
Great Joy, in all their wyttis five
In heiryng, seeing, gustyng, smellyng
Induryng their delytesum dwelling
Heiryng the byrdis armoneis
Taistyng the fructis, of diverse treis
Smellyng the balmye dulce odouris
Quhilk did proceid, from fragrant flowris
Seeing so money heuinlye hewis
Off blomes brekyng on the bewis
Off twycheyng als, they had delight
Off vtheris bodeis, soft and quhyte
But doubt, Induryng that plesour
They lussit other Paramour
No marvel been thocht swa should be
Consyderyng their great bewte
Als God gave them command expres
To multyplie, and till incres
That their seid, and successioun
Mycht pleneis every Natioun
I list nocht tarry till declare
All properteis of that place preclare
Quhow herbis, and treis, grew ay grene
Nor of the temporat air serene
Quhow fructis, Indeficient
Ay alyke ripe and redolent
Nor of the Fontane, nor the fludis
Nor of the flowris pulchritudis
That matter Clerkis dois declare
Quharefore I speik of them na mare
The Scripture makes no mentioun
Quhow lang they rang in that Regioun
Bot I believe, the time was schorte
As diverse Doctouris dois report
FINIS
Of the Miserabyll Transgressioun of Adam.
FATHER? Hov happinnit ye mischance
(Quod I) schaw me the circumstance
Declaryng me that cairfull case Cour.

Quhow Adam lost that plesand place
From him and his Successioun
Quhow did proceid that transgressioun
(Quod he) after my rude Ingyne
I sall rehers the that rewyne Expe.

Quhen God the Plasmatour of all
In to the heuin Imperial
Did Creat all the Angels brycht
He maid one Angel, most of mycht
To quhome he gaif pre-eminence
Above them all in sapience
Because all other he did prefer
Namit he was brycht Lucefer
He was so plesand, and so fair
He thocht him self, without compair
And grew so gay and glorious
He began to be presumptuous
And thocht that he wald set his sait
In to the north and make bebait
Agane the Majesty Divine
Quhilk was the cause of his rewyne
For he incurrit Goddis Ire
And banyst from the heuin Impyre
With Angellis money one Legioun
Quhilkes were of his opinioun
Innumerabyll, with him their fell
Sum lychtit in the lawest hell
Sum in the sey did make repair
Sum in the earth, sum in the air
That most unhappy cumpanye
At Father Adam had Inuye
Parsaueyng Adam, and his seid
In to their places to succeid
Gene. iii.
The Serpent, was the subtellest
Above all beistis and craftyest
Than Satan, with ane falls intent
Did enter in to that Serpent
Imagenyng sum craftye wyle
Quhow he mycht Adam best begyle
And gar him brek commandiment
Bot to the woman, first he went
Traistyng the better to preuaill
Full subtellye did her assaill
With facund wordis, falls and fair
He grew with her familiair
That he his purpose mycht auance
Beleuand in her, Inconstance
Quhat is the cause, Madame (said he)
That e forbeir, one plesand tree
Quhilk been but peir most precious
Quhose fruct been most delytious
I Nyll (quod sche) their to accord
We are forbyddin, be the Lord
The quhilk hes geuin ws liberty
Till eait of every fruct and tree
Quhilk growis in to Paradyse
Brek we command, we are nocht wise
He gave till ws ane strait command
That tree to twyche, nocht with our hand
Eit we of it, without remede
He said but dout, we sulde be deed
Believe nocht that (said the Serpent)
Eit e of it, Incontinent
Repleit e sall be with Science
And haif perfyte Intelligence
Like God him self, of evil and good
Than haistellye for to conclude
Heiryng of this prerogatyue
Sche pullit down the fruct belyue
Throw counsall of the false Serpent
And eit of it, to that intent
And patt her Husband in believe
That plesand fruct, gyf he wald preue
That he should be als Sapient
As the great God Omnipotent
Thynk e nocht that ane plesand thing
That we like God, should ever ryng
He herand this Narratioun
And be her solistatioun
Mouit be prydefull ambitioun
He eit on that conditioun
The principal poyntis, of this offense
War pride, and Inobedience
Desyring for to be Equal
To God, the Creature of all
Allace Adam, quhy did thou so
Quhy causit thou this mortal woe
Had thou been constant firm and stabyll
Thy glore had been Incomparabyll
Quhare was thy consyderatioun
Quhilk had the Dominatioun
Off every leuyng Creature
That God had formit be Nature
Till use them at thy awin d^uyse
Was thou nocht prince of Paradyse
Was never man, sen syne on live
That God gave sic Prerogatyue
He gaif the strenth, above Sampsone
And sapience more than Salomone
oung Absolone, in his time most fair
To thy bewte, was no compair
Arestotyll, thou did precell
In to Phylosophie, naturell
Virgill in till his Poetrye
Nor Cicero, in till Oratrye
War never half so Eloquent
Quhy brak thou Gods commandiment
Quhare was thy wytt, that wald nocht flee
Far from the presens of that tree
Gaif nocht thy Maker the fre will
To take the good, and leif the evil
Quhow mycht thy forfalt be excusit
That Gods commandiment refusit
Throuch thy wyffis perswasioun
Quhilk hes been the occasioun
Sen syne that money nobyll men
Be the evil counsall of women
Alluterlye distroyit been
As in the Storeis may be seen
Quhilk now, we neid nocht till declair
Bot fordwart till our purpose fair.
Quhen they had eaitin of the fruit
Off Joy, than were they destitute
Than began they boith, for to thynk schame
And to be naikit, thocht defame
And maid them Breikes, of leuis grene
That their secreites, should nocht be seen
Bot in the stait of Innocence
They had none sic experience
Bot quhen they war to Syn subiectit
To schame and dreid, they war coactit
And in ane busk, they hid them cloce
Aschamit of the Lordis voce
Quhilk callit Adam be his name
(Quod he) my Lord, I thynk great schame
Naikit to cum, to thy presence
Thou had none sic experience
Quod God, quhen thou was Innocent
Quhy brake thou my commandiment
Allace (quod Adam) to the Lord
The verity, I sall record
This woman that thou gaif to me
Gart me eit, of one plesand tree
Rychtso the woman her excusit
And said, the Serpent me abusit
Than to the Serpent, God said thus
O thou Dissauer venomous
Because the woman, thou begylit
From thine forth, sall thou be exylit
Cursed and waryit, sall thou be
So sall thy seid, be after the
Cauld earth, salbe thy fude also
And creipand on thy breist sall go
Als I sall putt Inamite
Betuix the woman ever and the
Betuix thy seid, and womanis seid
Salbe continual mortal feid
Quhowbeit thou hes wrocht their myscheuis
It sall nocht be as thou beleuis
Sic seid salbe in woman sawin
That thy power, salbe down thrawin
Treddyng thy heid, that thou may feill
And thou sall tred him on the heill
This was his promys, and menyng
That the Immaculat Virgyng
Sulde beir the Prince Omnipotent
Quhilk should tred down, that falls Serpent
Satan, and all his company
And them confunde alluterlye.
Quod I, give Satan prince of hell Cour.

Spak in the Serpent as e tell
And beistis can no way syn at all
Quhy was the Serpent maid so thrall
I heir men say affore that hour
The Serpent had ane fair figour
And eid straucht up vpone his feit
And had his membris all compleit
As vtheris beistis vpone the bent
Expe.
(Quod he) for he was Instrument
To Satan, in this Misery
Puneist he was, as e may se
As be experience thou may know
Expres in to the commoun Law
Ane man conuickit for bewgrye
The beist is brynt, als weill as he
Quhowbeit the beist be Innocent
And so befell, of the Serpent
It was the Feynd, sull of dispyte
Off Adamis fall, quhilk had the wit
As he hes had of money mo
Bot till our purpose lat ws go.
Than to the woman, for her offense
God did pronunce, this sore sentence
All plesour, that thou had afforrow
Sall cheangit be in lestyng sorrow
Quhare that thou should, with mirth and Joy
Have borne thy birth, butt pane or noy
Now all thy bairnis sall thou bair
With dolor, and continual cair
And thou salbe, for oucht thou can
Ever subiectit to the man
Be this sentence, God did conclude
Women from liberty denude
Quhilk be experience e may se
Quhow Quenis, of most hie degree
Ar under most subiectioun
And sufferis most correctioun
For they like byrdis in till ane cage
Ar keipit ay under thirlage
So all women in their degree
Should to their men, subiectit be
Quhowbeit sum it will strive for stait
And for the maistrye make debait
Quhilk gyf they want, boith ewin and morrow
Their men will suffer mekle sorrow
Off Eve, they tak that qualite
To desire Soueranite
And than till Adam, said the Lord
Because that thou hes done accord
Thy will, and harknit to thy wife
Now sall thou lose this plesand life
Thou was till her obedient
Bot thou brake my commandiment
Curste and baren, the earth salbe
Quhare ever thou gois, till that thou de
But laubour, it sall beir no corn
Bot Thirsyll, Nettyll, Breir, and Thorn
For fude, thou gettis none other beild
Bot eait the herbis, apone the field
Sore laubouryng, till thy browis sweit
From thine forth, sall thou wyn thy meit
I maid the of the earth certane
And thou in earth, sall turn agane
Than maid he them Abilement
Off skynnis, ane raggit raiment
Them to preserve from heit and cauld
Than grew their dolor money fauld
Now Adam ar e like till ws
With our gay garment glorious
To them their wordis, said the Lord
Than cryit they boith Misericorde
Quhen from that Garth, with hartis sore
Baneist they were, for ever more
On to this wracheit vaill of sorrow
With daily laubour ewin and morrow
After quhose dolorous departing
The Lord gave Paradyce in keeping
Till ane Angel of Ierubin
That none should have entres their in
At the quhilk entres, he did stand
With flammand fyrie sweird in hand
To keip that Adam, and his wife
Sulde nocht taist of, the tree of life
For give they of that tree had preuit
Perpetuallye, they mycht have leuit
So Adam, and his Successioun
Off Paradyce, tynt possessioun
And be this syn Original
War men to Misery maid thrall
My Son now may thou cleirly se
This world began with misere
With misery, it doith proceid
Quhose fine sall dolor be and dreid

In Mamber, in that lusty vaill
Quhilk after was, the Iowis land
Quhare it his Sepulture dois stand

The woe of Adam, nor his wyue
Nor tell, quhen they had Sonnis two
Cayn, and Abell, and no mo
Nor quhow cursed Cayn, for Inuy
Did slay his Brother creuelly
Nor of their murnyng, nor their moan
Quhen they but Sonnis, were left allone
Abell lay slane, vpone the ground
Cursed Cayn flemit, and Vagabound
Nor quhow God of his special grace
Send them the third Son fair of face
Most like Adam, of slesche and blude
Seth was his name, gracious and good
Nor quhow blind Lameth, raikleslye
Did slay Cayn, vnhappelye
Adam as Clerkis dois discriue
Begat with Eve his woeful wyue
Off men Childryng thretty and two
And of Dochteris alyke also
Be this thou may weill understand
That Adam saw, money ane thousand
That of his body, did descend
Or he out of the world did wend
Gene. v.
Adam leifit in earth, but weir
Compleit, nine hundredth and thretty eir
And all his dayis war bot sorrow
Rememberyng boith ewin and morrow
Off Paradyce, the prosperity
Syne of his great miseritie
His heart mycht never be reiosit
Remembryng quhow the heuin was closit
From him and his successioun
And that be his transgressioun
After his deith, as I heir tell
His Saul discendit to the hell
And their remanit presoneir
In that Dungeoun, three thousand eir
And more, so did boith evil and good
Till Christ for them, had sched his blude
Than be that most precious ransoun
They were delyuerit of presoun
I have declarit now as I can
The misery of the first man.

And the matter so miserabyll
Bot for to schaw the Circumstance
Manefestlye of that myschance
First I mon gar the understand
Quhow Adam gaif express command Gene vi.

That those quhilkes come of Sethis blude
Because they were gracious and good
Should nocht contract with Cainnis kyn
Quhilkes were Inclynit all to Syn,
Till observe that commandiment
Cain past in the Orient
With his wife, callit Calmana
Quhilk was his awin Sister alswa
Quhare his ofspryng, did lang remane
Beside the Montane of Tarbane
And Seth did lang time led his life
With Delbora, his prudent wife
Quhilk was his Sister good and fair
In Damassene, maid their repair
In that country of Sethis clan
Discendit money holy man
So lang as Adam was leueand
The people did observe command
Quhen he was deed, and laid in ground
And people greitly did abound
And Cayn slane, as I have schawin
And Sethis dayis, all over blawin
The Sonnis than of Sethis blude
Seand the plesand pulchritude
Off the Ladyis, of Caynnis kyn
Quhowbeit they knew weill, it was Syn
Oppressed with sensual lustis rage
Did tak them in to Marriage
And so corruptit was that blude
The good with evil, and evil with good
Than as the people did incres
They did abound in wickitnes
As holy Scripture dois rehers

Or tell with tongue, I am nocht abyll

Quhow men, and women, schamefullye

Off fruct, and Spyce, delicious
The herbis were so confortabyll
Delytesum and Medicinabyll
The Fontannis fresche and redolent
To laubouryng, they tuke lytill tent
All manner of beistis at their plesour
Did multyplie, without laubour
The time betuix Adam and Noye
To se the earth, it was great Joy
Plantit with precious treis of price
Four famous Fludis of Paradyce
Ran throw the earth, in syndrie partis
Spreddyng their branchis, in all airtis
The walter was so strange and fine
They wald nocht laubour to make wine
The fruct, and herbis, were so good
They maid no cair, for other fude
And so the people tuke no cure
Bot past their time, at their pleasure
Ay fyndand new Inuentionis

So that the Lord Omnipotent
That he maid man, did him repent
And schew on till his Seruand Noye

And so they were Incounsolabyll

Father, e gart me understand
Quhen Adam brak the Lords command
Till agment his afflictioun

On to the earth, quhilk was so fair
That it should barren be, and bair
And without laubour beir no corn
Nor fruct, bot thirsyll, breir, and thorn
Now say e in, the time of Noye
To se the earth, it was great Joy

And from the Heuin, the rane down dang

Except them in the Ark with Noye

And quhen that Noye, had done espy
Quhow that the earth, began to dry

His stalwartnes that durst ganestand
No marvel was, thocht he was wycht
Ten Cubitis large, he was of hycht
Proportionat, in lenth and breid
Afferand to his hycht we reid

So prydefull, and presumptuous
That he come Inobedient

And Iunit of so strong fassioun
With Syment maid of pyk and tar

Thocht fire or walter it assalit
Contrare that Dungeoun nocht aualit
The land about was fair and plane
And it rose like one heych montane
Those fuliche people did intend
That to the Hewin, it sulde ascend
So great one strenth was neuir seen
In to the world with mennis eine
The wallis of that wark they maid
Two and fyftye faldome braid
One faldome than as sum men sayis

One man was th^n of more stature

Bot king Nynus, the battle wan
Quhare slane were money nobyll man
And to that king wald gyf no grace
Bot planelie in one publict place
With his se win Sonnis, and his Lady
Creuellie did them Crucify
Off that tryumphe he did reiose
Syne fordwart to the feilde he gose
Than conquest he Armenia
Perce, Egypt, and Pamphelia
Capadoce, Leid and Maritane
Gaspia, Phrigia* and Hyrcane,
All Africa, and Asia,
Except great Ynde, and Battria,
Quhilk he did conques efterwart
As e sall heir or we depart
Now wald I or we forthee mend
That his Ydolatrye were kend
Syne after that without sudiorne
Till our purpose we sall return.
FINIS.
Quhov king Nynus, Inuentit the First Ydolatrie of Ymagis.
NYNVS one Image he gart make.
For King Bellus, his Fatheris saik
Moist like his Father of figoure
Off quantite and portratoure
Off fine Gold was that figour maid
Ane crafty Croun apone his haid
With precious stonis in toknyng
His father Bellus was ane King
In Babilone he ane tempyll maid
Off crafty work boith heych and braid
Quharein that Image gloriously
Was thronit vpe tryumphandlie.
Than Nynus gaif ane strait command
Till all the people of that land
Alsweill in till Asseria
As in Synear, and Caldia
Under his Dominatioun
They should make Adoratioun
Apone their kneis to that figour
Under the pane of forfaltour
Their was no Lord in all that land
His summonding that durst ganestand
Than oung, and auld, boith great and small
Till that Image they prayit all
And cheangit his name as I heir tell
From Bellus to their great God Bell
In that tempyll he did deuyse
Preistis for till make sacrifyse
Be conswetud than come one law
None other God that they wald know
And als he gaif to that Image
Off Sanctuary the Priuilage
For quhat sum ever transgressour
One homicede or oppressor
Seand that Image in the face
Off their gylt gat the kyngis grace.
Declare to me sweit schir (said I) Cour.

Was their no more Ydolatry
After that this false Idol Bell
Was thronit up as e me tell
My Son (said he) incontinent
The nowellis throuch the world they went Expe.

Quhow king Nynus, as I haif said
One curious Image he had maid
To the quhilk all his natioun
Maid deuote adoratioun
Than every cuntre tuke consait
They wald king Nynus contrafait
Quhen any famous man was deid
Set up one Image in his steid
Quhilk they did honor from the spleen
As it Immortal God had been
Imagis sum maid for the nonis
Off fine gold, sum of stokis and stonis
Off silver sum, and Euyr bone
With diverse namis till eueryone
For sum they callit Saturnus
Sum Jupiter, sum Neptunus
And sum they callit Cupido
Their god of lufe, and sum Pluto
They callit sum Mercurius
And sum the wyndie Eolus
Sum Mars, maid like ane man of weir
Inarmit weill with sword and speir
Sum Bacchus, and sum Apollo
Off namis they had ane houndreth mo
And quhen one Lady of great fame
Was deed, for till exalt her name
One Image of her portratour
Wald set vpe in one orator
The quhilk they callit their gods
As Venus, Juno, and Palles
Sum Cleo, sum Proserpina
Sum Ceres, Vesta, and Diana
And sum the great gods Mynarue
With curious collouris they wald carue
Amang the Poetis, thou may see
Off falls gods the genologee
So their abhominationis
Did spread ouerthort all nationis
Except good Habraham, as we reid
Quhilk honourit God, in (...)
For Habraham had his beginny^^
In to the time of Nynus king
Nynus began with tyrranrie
And Habraham with humy^itie
Nynus began the first Impyre
Habraham of weir, had no d^syre
Nynus began Idolatrye
Habraham, in spreit and veritye
He prayit to the Lord allone
Falls Imagry he wald have none
Off him discendit I heir tell
The twelf great Trybis of Israel
Those people maid adoratioun
With humyll supplicatioun
Till him quhilk was of kyngis king
That hewin and earth, maid of no thing
Deed Ymagis, they held at nocht
That were with mennis handis wrocht
Bot the almychtie God of live
My son now haif I done discryue
Their questionis at thy command
The quhilkis thou did at me demand
Quhat was the cause (schir make me sure) Cour.

Ydolatrye did so lang endure
Outthrouch the world so generalie
And with the Gentilis specialie
(Quod he) sum causis principal
I find in my memorial
First was throuch princis commandiment
Quhilk did ydolatrye invent
With their great deuilische god Dagone
With vtheris Idolis money one
Bot I abhore the treuth to tell
Off the Princis of Israel
Chosin be God Omnipotent
Quhow they brak his commandiment
iii. Reg. xi.
King Salomone, as the scripture sayis
He doitit in his latter dayis
His wantoun wyffis, to compleis
He curit nocht God, till displeis
And did committ Idolatrye
Wyrschipyng caruit Ymagerye
As Moloch, god of Ammonitis
And Chamos, god of Moabitis
Astaroth, god of Sydoniains
So for his inobediens
And foul abhominatioun
Were puneist his successioun
His son Roboam, I heir tell
Tynt the ten Trybis of Israel
For his fatheris Ydolatrye
As in the scrpture thou may see.

In stok, nor stone can be non holiness.
In the desert, the people of Israel
Moses remanyng in the mont Synaye
They maid one moltin Calf, of fine mettell
Quhilk they did honor as their God verraye Exodi. xxxii.

Bot quhen Moses discendit I heir say
And did consydder their Ydolatrye
Off that people, three thousand gart he slaye
As the scripture at lenth doith testifye.
Daniell.xiiii.
Because the holy propheit Daniell.
In Babilone Ydolatrie, repreuit
And wald nocht worschip their falls Idol Bell
The hole people at him were so aggreuit
To that effect, that he should be myscheuit
Delyuerit him till rampand Lyonis sewin
Bot of that dangerous den, he was releuit
Throuch myrakle of, the great God of hewin
Behald quhow Nabuchodonosor king
Dan. iii.
In to the vaill of Duran, did prepare
One Image of fine Gold, one meruallous thing
Three score of cubyts, heycht and saxin square
As more cleirlye thescripture doith declare
To quhome all people by proclamatioun
With bodeis bowit, and on their kneis bare
Rycht humelye maid adoratioun.
Ane great wounder, that day was seen also.
Quhow Nabuchodonosor, in his ire
Tuke Sydrach, Misach, and Abednago,
Quhilks wald nocht bow their kne at his desire
Till that Idol, gart kast them in the fire
For to be brynt, or he sterit of that steid
Quhen he beleuit, they were brynt bone and lyre
Was nocht consumit, one small hair of their heid
The Angel of the Lord was with them seen.
In that hait furneis passing vpe and down
In till ane rosye Garth, as they had been
None spott of fire, distenyng cote, nor goun
Off victory, they did obtene the croun
And were to them, that maid adoratioun
To that Ydoll, or bowit their body down
One wytnessing of their dampnatioun
Quhat was the cause, at me? thou may demand
That Salomone. vsit none Ymagrye
In his tryumphand Tempyll for till stand
Off Abraham, Ysac, Iacobe, nor Iesse
Nor of Moses, their sauegarde throuch the sea
Nor Iosue, their valiant Campioun
Because God did command the contrary
That they sulde use sic superstitioun
Behald quhow the great God Omnipotent
To preserve Israel, from Idolatrye Exodi. xx

Derectit them one strait commandiment
They should nocht make, none caruit ymagrye
Another of gold, of silver, stone, nor tree
Nor gyf worschip till any simlytude

Declaryng them their great abutioun
Spekand in manner of dirysioun
Quhow deed Idolis, be mennis handis wrocht
Quham they honourit, with humyll orisioun
Were in the markat daily sauld and bocht

Off the Gentylis, and their unfaithfulness
For till agment, their superstitioun
In those Ydolis, they maid their entres
And in them spak, as storyis doith expres
Than men beleuit of them to get releif
Askand them help, in all their besynes
Bot finallye that turnit to their myscheif
Traist weill in them, is none Divinity
Quhen reik, and rowst, their fair color doith faid
Thocht they have feit, one fute they can not flee
Quhowbeit the tempyll byrn above their haid
In them is another freindschip nor remaid
In sic fyguris, quhat favor can e find
With mouth and eris, and eine thocht they be maid
All men may se. they ar dum, deif, and blind
Quhowbeit they fall down flatlyngis on the flure
They haif none strenth their self to raise agane
Thocht Rattonis ouir yame ryn they tak no cure
Quhowbeit yai breik yare neck, they feil no pane
Quhy sulde men psalms to them sing or sane
Sen growand treis, that eirly berith fruit
Ar more to pryse, I make it to the plane
Nor cuttit stockis, wanting boith crope and rute
Off Edinburgh, the great Idolatrye.

They beir ane auld stock Image throuch ye town
With talbrone, troumpet, schalme, and Clarioun

And dois assist to sic Idolatrye

Bot quhen Elias, did preue their abusioun

So at one hour, came their confusioun.
I pray ow prent in our remembrance.
Quhow the reid Freris, for their Idolatrye
In Scotland, Ingland, Spane, Italy, and France

Bot al obeyit was fra hand

Scho grew proud and presumptuous
And at the king scho did desire
Five dayis to govern his Impyre
And he of his benevolence
Did grant her that pre-eminence
With Sceptour, Crown, and Robroyall
And hole power Imperial
Till five dayis were cum and gone
That scho as king sulde ring allone

Scho tuke sic glore to ryng allone

Quhow euir it was in till his flowris

And mycht nocht lenth his life one hour
Thocht he was the first Concreoure
Quhose Conquessing, for to conclude
Was nocht bot great schedding of blude
Now have e hard of Nynus king
Quhow he began, and his ending
Quhowbeid mine Author Diodore

Princis for wrangus conquessing
Doith make often times ane evil ending
Thocht he had lang prosperity
He endit with miseretie.

Off king Nynus Sepulture.
THE Queen a sepultur sche maid
Quhar sche king Nynus body laid
Off curious crafty wark and wycht
The quhilk had stagis ix. of hit
and ten stagis of breid it was
Diodore says it was no les
For aucht Stagis one mile thou tak
And thairefter thy nummer make
So be this count, it was full rycht
One mile, als and one stage of hycht
Except the Tower of Babilone
So heych one wark, I reid of none
Semiramis, this lustye Queen
Consyddring quhat dainger been
To haif on King of tender aige
Quhilk mycht nocht use no vassalage
Scho tuke one curagious consait
Thinkand that scho wald make debait
Give any maid rebellioun
Contrar her Son, or his Regioun
Quhome sche did foster tenderly
And kepit him full quyetly
Scho laid apart her awin cleithyng
And tuke the Raiment of ane king
Quhen scho was in till Armor dycht
Mycht no man know her be one knycht
Scho valeantlye went to the weir
And to gyf battle tuke na feir
Dantyng all Realms round about
That all the world of her had doubt
More fortunat in her conquessing
Nor was her Husband Nynus king.

So plesandlye did them prepair
Quhilk in the earth, had no compair
Quhowbeid Nemrod, of quhome I spoke

Quhare Nemrod left, their scho began
And pat to wark money one man
Off all the Realms round about
Off most Ingyne, scho socht them out
Scho had wyrkand with tree and stonis
Twell hundredth thousand men at onis
Go reid the buke of Diodore
And thou sall find the nummer more
On euerilk side of Euphrates
That nobyll City beildit was
And so that river of renown
Ran throuch the mydpart of the town
Ouerthort that flude scho bryggis maid
Off marvelous strenth, boith lang and braid
They were five stagis large of lenth
On euerilk bryg, scho maid ane strenth

To quhome e wald gyf no credens

Or Allexander the Concreoure

It were to me one great laubour
And tiddious to the Auditour
Quhat scho did in Ethopia
And in the land of Medea
Beildand Cities, Castellis, and Towris

For the exaltyng of her name
And Immortal to make her fane
Off Iarcieus, the heych Montanis
Scho gart ryue down, and make them planis

With hyddous cry and trumpettis sound
Till thousandis deed lay on the ground

Off the great oist, they rudlye ruscheit
That men and horse, till earth, trabuscheit

To stryke at him, scho tuke no feir
So weill sche vsit was in weir

Were nocht the king was so weill montit
Athir at other straik so fast
Till they were tyrit at the last
The king he thocht him self eschamit
With one woman to be diffamit
And was determit nocht to flee
Thocht in that Battle he should dee
As man the quhilk disparit been
He rudely ran vpone the queen
And throuch the arm gaif her ane wound
Quhilk till her heart gaif sic one stound

Off fleand folkis, quhilk was great wounder
So that the Bargis krake in schonder
Sum sank, sum down the reuar ran
Than drownit their money one nobyll man
Quhilk were great piete till deplore
As wryttis famous Diodore.
And finally for to conclude
Was never sched so mekle blude
At one time sen the world began
Nor slane so money one saikles man
And all throw the occasioun
And the prydefull perswasioun
Off this ambitious wyckit Queen
Sick one was neuir hard nor seen

Seand sa money taken and slane
Till her country, returnit agane
Lamentand fortunis variance
Quhilk brocht her to so great myschance
Affore quhilk was so fortunat
And than of confort desolat.
Her Son one man of perfectioun
Consyddrand his subiectioun
His liberty he did desire
That he mychte govern his Impyre
Seand his Mother vicious
And with that so ambitious
As mine Author doith speci^ye
He slew his Mother creuellye
Quhat other cause, or Intentioun
I find no special Mentioun
Sum sayis, to be at Liberty
Sum sayis, for her Adultrie
None other cause, I can defyne
Except punissioun deuyne.

Behald the endyng dolorous

Quhen scho began her vassalage
And rang tryumphandlye but weir

Quhen scho was slane, scho was three score
With eris two, scho was no more
As Diodore wryttis in his buke

Off this Lady I make ane end
Thynkand no way, I can commend
Women for till be to manlye
Nor men for till be womanlye
For quhy, It been the Lordis mind

And women under obediens
Thocht all women inclynit be

Till that intent that scho mycht ryng

Or Realms tak in gouernyng
Quhowbeit they waileant be and wycht
Going in Battle like one knycht
As did proud Pantasilia
The Princes of Amasona
In mennis habyte aganis reassoun
Siclyke I think dirisioun
One prince to be effaminate
Of knychtlye courage desolate
Neglectand his authority

Sic kyngis, I discommend at all

Quhilk was the saxt and threttye king
Be line from Nynus discendyng
At lenth his life for to declare
I thynk it is nocht necessare
Because that money cunnyng clerkis
Hes him discryuit in their werkis
Quhow he was last of Asserians
Quhilk had the hole preemynans
That time of the first Monarche
In Cronicles, as thou may se
The last, and the mo^^ vicious king
Quhilk in that Monarche did ryng
That Prince was so effeminate
With sensual lust intoxicate
He did abhor the cumpanye
Off his most nobyll chewalrye
That he mycht have the more delight
Till use his beistlye appetyte
Conuersit with women nycht and day
And clothit him, in their arraye
So that na man that him had seen
Could Judge ane man, that he had been
So in huredome and harlatrye
Did keip him self so quyetlye
The Princis of Asserience
Off him they could get no presence
Thus leuit he contynualye
Agane nature Inordinatlye
Quhen to the Peirsis and the Medis
Reportit were his vicious dedis
With the Rewlaris of Babilone
They did conclude all in till one
They wald nocht suffer for till ryng
Abufe them sic ane vicious king
Bot Arbates, ane Duke of Mede
He Darflye tuke on hand that deed
Bot first he come to Nyniue
To see the kyngis Majesty
And till one of the kyngis gaird
He gaif one secreit rich rewaird
Till put him in ane quiet place
Quhare he mycht se the kyngis grace
And be on seen with any wycht
Bot he saw another King nor Knycht
In till his maisteris cumpanye
Except women allanerlye
And as ane woman he was cled
With women counsalit and led
And schamefullye he was syttand
With Spindle, and with Rock, spinnand
Quhen Arbates that sycht had seen
His courage rasit from the spleen
And thocht it small difycultie
For till depryue his Majesty
Than rasit he the Persianis
With Medis and Babilonianis
Inarmit weill with speir and scheildis
Tryumphantlye they tuke the feildis
The king rasit Asserianis
To gidther with the Caldianis
And them resystit as he mycht
Bot finally he tuke the flycht
To saif him self in Nyniue
Than segit they that great City
Contynuallie two eir and more
As wryttis famous Diodore
Till that the flude of Euphrates
Arrose with sic one furiousnes
Quhare throuch ane great part of the town
By violence was doungin down
Than quhen the king saw no remeid
Bot to be takin or to be deid
As man disparit full of ire
Gart make ane furious flammand fire
And tuke his gold and Iewellis all
With Sceptur, Croun, and Robe Royal,
With all his tender seruituris
That of his Corpse, had gretest curis
To gydder with his lustye Quenis
And all his wantoun Concubenis
And in that fire, he did them cast
Syne lape him self, in at the last
Quhare all were brynt in poulder small
Thus endit king Sardanapall
Withouttin any repentence
As may be seen, be this sentence
Heir followyng, quhilk he did indyte
Affore his deith, in great dispyte
Quhilk is ane rycht ungodly thing
As e may se be his dyting.

Monarcheis. With ye Misarabyll Distructioun of Jerusalem And last of the
Spiritual Monarchy.
FATHER I pray ow to me tell
Quhat notabyll thyngis that befell Cour.

During the King of Asseriens
Quhilk had so lang prehemynens
I mean of other Nationis
Under their dominationis
That may be done in termys schorte
(Said he) as storyis doith report Expe.

Induryng this first Monarchy
Become that woeful misarie
Off Sodom, Gomore, and their Regione
As Scripture makis Mentione Genesis xix.

Quhose people were so sensual
In fylthie Synnis unnatural
The quhilk in to my vulgar veirs
My tongue abhorris to reheirs
Like brutall beistis by their myndis
Unnaturally abusit their kyndis
By fylthie stynkand Lychorie
And most abhominabyll Sodomie
As holy scripture doith discryue
In that country were Citeis five
Quhilk were Sodom, and Gomora
Seboin, Segore, and Adama
Amang them all, funde was their none
Vndefylit, bot Lot, allone
Holy Abraham dwelt neir hand by
Quhilk prayit for Lot, effectuously
For God maid him aduertysment
That he wald make sic punyschement
To Lot two Angellis God did send
Him from that furye till defend
Quhen the people of that regioun
Saw the Angellis cum to the town
Transformit in to fair oung men
They purposit them for to ken
And abuse them unnaturally
With their foul stynkand Sodomye
Off that good Lot, was wounder woo
And offerit them his Douctheris two
Them at their plesour for till use
Bot they his Douctheris did refuse
And than the Angellis be their mycht
Those men depryuit of their sycht
And so perfors leitt them allone
To Lottis lugyng, quhen they were gone
They him commandit haistelie
For till depart of that City
That foul unnatural Lychorie
A vengeance to the hewin did cry
The quhilk did mofe God till sic ire
That from the hewin Brintstone and fire
With awful thoundryng, ranit down
And did consume that hole regioun
Off all that land chapit no mo
Except Lot, and his Douctheris two
His wife was turnit in A stone
So wyfles was he left allone
For scho was Inobedient
And kepit no commandiment
Quhen the Angel gaif them command
Sone till depart out of that land
He monyste them under great pane
Never to luke, bakwart agane
Quhen Lottis wife, hard the thoundring
Off flammand fire and lychtnyng
The ugly cryis lamentabyll
Off people most appouentabyll
For none of them had fors to flee
Scho arnit that sorrowful sycht to see
And as scho turnit her anon
Scho was transformit in a stone
Quhare scho remanis till this day
Off her I have no more to say
To schaw at leynth I am nocht abyll
That pietious process lamentabyll
Quhow Ceteis, Castellis, Tounis and Towris,
Villagis, Bastaileis, and Bowris
They were all in to poulder drewin
Forrestis, be the ruttis vprewin
Their King, their Queen, and people all
ong and auld, brynt in poulder small
No Creature was left on life
Foulis, Beistis, Man, nor Wife
The earth, the Corn, herb, fruit, and tree
The Babbis, vpone the Noryse kne
Rycht suddantlye in one Instent
Vnwerly come their Judgment
As it come in the time of Noye
Quhen God did all the world distroye
For that self Syn of Sodomye
And most abhominabyll bewgrye
That vice at lenth for till declare
I thynk it is nocht necessare
Quhen all was brynt, flesche, blud, and bonis
Hyllis, valais, stokis, and stonis
The Cuntre sank for to conclude
Quhare now standith ane vglye flude
The quhilk is callit the deed see
Nixt to the cuntre of Indee
Quhose stynkand strandis blak as tar
The flewre of it, men felith on far
In till Orocius, thou may reid
Off that cuntre, the lenth and breid
Of lenth fyftye mylis and two
And fourtene mile in breid also.
Lot of his wife was so aghast
That he till A. wyld Montane past
Off cumpanye he had no mo
Except his lustye Douchteris two
And be their prouocatioun
As Moses makith narratioun
Allone in to that montane wild

For they beleuit in their thocht
That all the world was gone to nocht
As it become of that Natioun
Thynkand that Generatioun
Wald faill, without they craftellye
Gar their Father with them to lie
And so they fand ane crafty wyle
Quhow they their Father mycht begyle
And causit him, to drynk wycht wine
Quhilk men to Lychorye doith Inclyne
Quhen he was full, and fallin on sleip
His Douchteris quyetlye did creip
In till his bed, full secreitlye
Prouokand him with them to lie
And knew nocht quhow he was begylde
Till boith his Douchteris were with child
And bure two Sonnis in certane

Off quhome two Nationis did proceid
As in the scripture thou may reid
In the quhilk scripture thou may se
At lenth this woeful misarie
This misarie become but weir

FINIS.
Ane Schort Discriptioun of the secund. third. and ferd Monarche.
FATHER (said I) quhilk was the man. Cour.

That the nyxt Monarchye began
Cyrus (said he) the king of Pers
As Cronicles, hes done rehers Expe.

Prudent and full of Pollicye
Began the secunde Monarchye
For he was the most godly king
That ever in Pers or Mede did ryng
For he of his Benyngnitie.ii. Para. xxxxi.

Delyuerit from Captyuitie
The hole People of Israel
In to the time of Daniell
The quhilkis had been presoneris
In Babilone sewin score of eris
Tharefor God of his grace benyng
Gaif him ane divine knawleging
During his time as I heir tell
He vsit counsall of Daniell
Carione, at lenth doith specify
Off his marvelous Natyuitie
And of his vertuus vpbrynging
And quhow he vincuste Cresus king
With money other vaileant deid
As in to Carione, thou may reid
Quhose Successioun did endure
Till the tent King, thareof be sure
Bot after his great conquessyng
Rycht miserabyll was his endyng
As Herodotus, doith discryfe
In Scythia he lost his life
Quhare the vndantit Seethianis
Vincuste those nobyll Persianis
And after that Cerus was deed
Queen Tomyre hakkit of his head
Quhilk was the queen of Seethianis
In the dispyte of Persianis
Scho kest his heid, for to conclude
In till ane vessel full of blude
And said, their wourdis creuellye
Drynk now thy fill, gyf thou be dry
For thou did aye blude schedding thryste
Now drynk at laser gyf thou list
After that Cyrus successioun
Off all the world had possessioun
Till Allexander with swerd and fire
Obtenit perfors the third Impyre
Quhilk was the king of Macedone
With vaileant Grekis money one
In battle fell and furious
Vincuste the mychtie Darious
Quhilk was the tent and the last king
Quhilk did after king Cyrus ryng
As for this potent Empriour
Allexander the Conquereour
Give thou at lenth, wald reid his ryng
And of his creuell conquessyng
In Inglis tongue, in his great buke
At lenth his life, their thou may luke
Quhow Allexander that potent King
Was twelf eris in his Conquessyng
And quhow for all his great conquest
He leuit bot ane eit in rest
Quhen be his Seruand secretlye
He poysonit was full pietuouslye.
Lucane doith Allexander compair
Till thounder, or fyreflaucht, in the air
One creuell Planeit, A mortal weird
Down thryngand people, with his sweird
Ganges that most famous flude
He myxit with the Indianis blude
And Euphrates, with the blude of Pers
Quhose creueltie for to rehers
And saikles blude, quhilk he did sched
War rycht abhominabyll to be red
After his schort prosperity
He deit with great miseritie.
Itt were to lang for to dissydit
Quhow all his realms were deuydit
Aye quhill that Caesar Iulyus
Quhen he had vincust Pompeyus
Was chosin Emperiour and king
Abufe the Romany for till ryng
That potent Prince was the first man
Quhilk the ferd Monarche began
And had the hole Dominioun
Off euerilk land and Regioun
Quhose successouris, did ryng but weir
Over the world, money one hundredth eir
Bot gentle Iulyus, allace
Rang Empriour, bot lytill space
Quhilk I thynk petye till deplore
In five Month and lytill more
By falls exhorbitant treasoun
That prudent Prince, was trampit down
And murdrest in his counsall house
By creuell Brutus, and Cascius
After that Iulyus was slane
Did ryng the great Octauiane
Off Empriouris one of the best
During his time, was peace and rest
Over all the world, in ilk regioun
As storyis makith mentioun
And als I make it to the plane
During the time of Octauiane
The Son of God our Lord Iesew
Tuke mankind of the Virgin true
Math. ii.
And was that time in Bethelem borne
To saif mankind, quhilk was forlorn
As Scripture makith narratioun
Off his blyst Incarnatioun
Now haif I tald the as I can
Quhow the four Monarchyis began
Bot in thy mind thou may consydder
Quhow warldly power been bot slydder
For all their great Impyris ar gone
Thou seis their is no Prince allone
Quhilk hes the hole Dominioun
This time of every Regioun
Father quhat reasone, had those kyngis Cour.

Reuarris to be of vtheris ryngis
But any rycht or Just querrell
Quhairthrouch that they mycht make battle
And commoun pepyll to dounthryng
To this (said I) make answeryng
My Son (said he) that sall be done
As I best can, and that rycht sone Expe.

Their Monarcheis, I understand
Preordinat were, by the command
Off God, the Plasmatour of all
For to down thryng, and to make thrall Dani.

Vndantit People vicious
And als for to be gracious
To them quhilk virtuous were and good
As Daniell heth done conclude
At lenth in till his Propheseis
Quhow their should be four Monarcheis
His secund Chepture, thou may see
Quhow after the first Monarchy
Quhen Nabuchodonosor king
Ane Image saw, in his slepyng
With austeir luke, boith heych and breid
And of fine pure Gold, was his heid
His breist, and arms, of silver brycht
His wamb of Copper, hard and wycht
His loynis, and lymmis, of Irne, rycht strong
His feit of clay, Irne myxt among
From A montane their come allone
But hand of man, A mekle stone
Quhilk on that Figoures feit did fall
And dang all down in poulder small.
Off quhose Interpretatioun
Doctouris doith make Narratioun
The head of gold, did signifye
First of Asserianis Monarchye
The silver breist, they did apply
To Persianis, quhilk rang secundly
The wambe of copper, or of brass
Thridly to Grekis, comparit wasse
His loynis, and lymmis, of Irne, and steill
Clerkis hes them comparit weill
To Romany, throuch their diligence
To have the Feird Preemynence
Abufe all other Natioun
Be this Interpretatioun
The myxit feit, with Irne, and clay
Did signifye this letter day
Quhen that the world sulde be deuydit
As efterwart salbe disydit
To Christ is signifyit the stone
Quhose Monarche sall never be gone
For under his Dominioun
All Princis sall be trampit down
Quhen that great king Omnipotent
Cumis to his general Judgment
His Monarche than salbe knawin
As after sall be to the schawin
And als the Scripture, sall the tell
Quhow in the aucht of Daniell
He saw in to his visioun
Be ane plane expositioun
Quhow that the Grekis, sulde wyrk vengeence
Vpone the Medis, and Persience
Comparand Grekis, till ane Got
With ane horn, fers, furious, and hot
Quhilk slew the Ram, with hornis two
Comparit till Pers, and Mede, all so
And so be Danielles prophesyis
All their great mychtie Monarchyis
The quhilkis all other realms supprysit
Be the great God, they were deuysit
As he of Tytus the Roman
Son and Air, to Vespasiane
Maid him ane Furious Instrument
To put the Iowis, to great torment
Quhilk I purpose or I hyne fair
Schortlie that p^ocesse to declair
FINIS.*
Of ye most miserabyl and most terrabill distructioun of Jerusalem.
Cour.
FATHER (said I) declare to me.
Induryng this ferd Monarchy
The may Infortune that befell
Expe.
My Son (said he) that sall I tell
The moist and manifest misarie
Became upon the great Cetie
Jerusalem, quhen it was suppressed
As storyis makis manifest
Bot as the Scripture doith deuyse
Baru. vi.
Jerusalem was distroyit twyse
First for the great Idolatrye
Quhilk they commyttit in Iowrye
The honor aucht to God allone
They gaif Figuris, of stoke and stone
Affore Christis Incarnatioun
Come this first desolatioun
Five hundredth eris, four score and ten
In Cronicles, as thou may ken
Quhow Nabuchodonosor king
That famous City, did down thryng
Their King, with people money one
Brocht them all bound to Babilone
Quhare they remanit Presoneris
The space of three score and ten eris
And that first desolatioun
Was callit the Transmigratioun
Was no man left in all their landis
Bot Purellis lauborand with their handis
Till mychtie Cyrus, king of Pers
As Daniell heth done rehers
Was mouit be God, for till restore
The Iowis, quhare that they were before.
Give I neglect, I were to blame
The last Sege of Jerusalem
Quhose rewyne was most miserabyll
And for to tell, rycht terrabyll
Was never in earth, Cetie nor town
Gatt sic extreme distructioun
The townis of Tire, Tebes, nor Troy
They sufferit never half sic noye
The Emprioure Vespasiane
He did deuyse that Sege certane.
Their was the Prophecy compleit
Quhilk Christ spoke on mont Olyueit Luc. x. xxi.

Quhen he Jerusalem beheld
The teris from his eine disteld Math. xiii.

Seand be Divine prescience
The great distructioun and vengence
Quhilk was to cum, on that Cetie
His heart was persit with Petie
Sayand Jerusalem, and thou knew
Thy great rewyne, sore wald thou rue
For no thing I can to the schaw
The verity, thou will nocht know
Nor hes in consydderatioun
Thy holy visitatioun
Thy people will no way considder Math. xxiii.

Quham gadtherit I wald haif to gidder
As errand scheip, been with their hirdis
Or as the Hen, gadderis her byrdis
Under her wyngis tenderlye
Quhilk they refusit dispitfullye
Quharefor sall cum that dulefull day
That no remedy make thou may
Thy Dungiounis sall be dung in schounder
So that the world, sall on the wounder
Thy tempyll now most tryumphand
Sall be tred down amang the sand
Matthew iiii.
And as he said, so it befell
As heir after I sall the tell.
Cour.
Schaw me (said I) with circumstance
The special cause of that myschance
Expe.
(Quod he) as scripture doith conclude
For scheddyng of the saikles blude
Off Prophetis quhilkes God to them send
And als because, that they myskend
Jesus the Son of God Souerane
Quhen he amang them did remane
For all the Myraklis, that he schew
Maliciouslye they him mysknew
Thocht be his great power divine
The walter cleir, he turnit in wine
Ihon.ii.
And be that self power and mycht
To the blind borne, he gaif the sycht
And gaif the crukit men their feit
And maid the lypir haill compleit
Ihon.xi.
He halit all, and rasit the deed
it held they him at mortal feed
Because he schew the verity Math.

They did conclude that he sulde de
The Byschoppis, princis of the preistis
They grew so boildin in their breistis Matthew xxvii.

The Scrybis, the Doctouris of the law
Off God nor man, quhilkis stude none aw
On Christ Jesus, to wyrk vengeance
Rycht so the false Pharesiance
Ane Sect of feneit Religioun
Deuysit his confusioun
And send their seruandis at the last
And with strange cordis, they band him fast
Syne scurgit him, boith bak and side Iho. xix.

That none for blude, mycht se his hyde
Their was nocht left ane penny breid
Vnwoundit from his feit till heid
In manner of dirisioun
They plett for him, ane creuell croun
Off pruneand thornis scharpe and lang
Quhilk on his hewinlye heid they thrang
Syne gart him for, the gretter lack
Beir his awin Gallous, on his back
Till the vile place of Caluare
Quhare money ane thousand man mycht se
That Innocent, they tuke perforce
And platt him bak wart to the Croce
Throuch feit and handis, great nalis they thryst
Till blude aboundantlye out bryst
Without grunschyng, clamor or cry
That pane he sufferit patientlye
And for agmentyng of his grefis
They hangit him, betuix two thefis
Quhare men mycht se the bludy strandis
Quhilkes sprang forth of his feit and handis
From thornis thristit on his heid
Ran down the bulryng stremis reid
In the presens of money one man
That blude royal on roches ran
Schortly to say that heuinlye King
In extreme dolor, their did hyng
Till he said, Consumatum est.
With A loud cry, he gaif the gaist
Quhen he was deed, they tuke one dart
And peirst that Prence, outthrouch the heart
Fra quham their ran, walter and blude
The earth than trymblit to conclude
Phoebus did hyde his beymes brycht
That throuch the world their was no lycht
The great vaill of the tempyll rave
The deed men raise, out of their grave
And in the Cetie did appeir
As in the Scripture thou may heir
Than Joseph, of Abaramathie
Did bury him, rycht honestly
Bot it he rose, full gloriouslye
Ihon, xx
On the third day tryumphandlye
With his Disciplis, in certane
Fourtye dayis he did remane Actis.i.

After that to the heuin ascendit
Their Iowis no thing their life amendit
Nor gaif no credens, till his sawis
As at more lenth, the storye schawis
Bot creuellye they did oppres
All men that Christ's name did profes
And persecutit money one
They presonit, boith Peter and Ihone Actis.v.

And Stewin, they stonit to the deed
From James the les, they straik the head Actis.v.

This was the cause, in conclusioun
Off their creuell confusioun
The prudent Iow, Josephus sayis
That he was present in those dayis
And in his buke, makith mentioun
Quhow after Christis Ascentioun
The space of two and forty eris
Began those creuell mortal weris
The secund eir of Vespasiane
Quhare money takin were and slane
Josephus planely doith conclude
Was never seen sic one multitude
Affore that time, in to the town
Quhilk come for their confusioun
Their great Infortune so befell
That all the Princis of Israel
Conuenit agane the time of Peace
Bot till return they had no grace
The bald Romany, with their Chiftane
Tytus the Son of Vespasiane
Their Army, over Judea spread
Than all men to the Ciete fled
Beleuand their to get releif
Bot all that turnit, to their myscheif
The Romany lappit them about
That be no way, they mycht wyn out
Sax Month, did that Sege endure
Quhare lost were money one creature
Quhilkes their in misary did remane
Till they were takin all or slane
During the time of this assail
Their meit, and drynk, and all did fail
For their was sic ane multitude
That thousands deit for falt of fude
Necessity gart them eit perforsse
Dog, Catt, and Rattone, Ass, and horse
Rich men, behuffit till eait their gold
Syne deit of hunger money fold
Sic hunger was without remeid
The quik behufit till eit the deid
The fylth of Closettes, money eit
To lenth their life, they thocht it sweit
The famous Ladyis of the town
For falt of fude, they fell in swoun
Quhen they mycht get none other meit
They slew their propir Bairnis to eit
Bot all for nocht dispytfullye
Their awin sowldiouris full gredelye
Reft them that flesche, most misarabyll
And they with murnyng lamentabyll
For extreme hunger ald the spreit Luc. xxiiii.

Their was the Prophecy compleit
As Christ affore maid narratioun
The day of his grym Passioun
Quhen that the Ladyis for him murnit
Full pietuouslye he to them turnit
And said, douchterres murne nocht for me
Murne on our awin posterity
Within schort time sall cum the day
That men of this Ciete sall say
Quhen they ar trappit in the snair
Blyst be the wamb, that never bair
The baren papis, than they sall blys

This prophecy, it come to pas
That day with money loud allas
Sic sorrowful lamentatioun
Was never hard in that natioun
Seand those lustye Ladyis sweit
Deand for hunger in the streit

Mycht give to them na conforting
Nor it releif them of their harmis
Bot atheris deand in vtheris armis
After this woeful Indigence
Amang them rose sic Pestilence
Quhare in their deit money hounder
Quhilk till declare, it were great wounder
And for fynall conclusioun
Those weirlyke wallis, they dang down
Prince Tytus, with his Chewalrye
With sound of trompe, Tryumphandlye
He enterrit in that great Ciete
Bot till declare I thynk piete
The panefull clamor horrabyll
Off woundit folk, most miserabyll
Their was nocht ellis, bot tak and slay
For their mycht no man wyn away
The strandis of blude ran throuch the stretis
Off deed folk, trampit under fetis
Auld Wedowis in the preis were smorit

The great Tempyll of Salamone
With money A curyous caruit stone
With perfyte pynnakles, on hycht
Quhilkes were rycht bewtyfull and wycht
Quhare in rich Iowelles, did abound
They ruscheit rudlye to the ground
And set in till their furious ire
Sancta, Sanctorum, in to fire
And with extreme confusioun
All their great Dungionis they dang down
Their bursin were the boildin breistis
Off Byschoppis princis of the preistis
Their takin was, the great vengeence
On falls Scrybis, and Pharisience
All their payntit Ipocrasie
That time mycht make them no supply
That day they dulefullye repentit
That to the deith of Christ consentit
Thocht it was our Saluatioun
Itt was to their Dampnatioun
The vengeance of the blude saikles
From Abell till Zacharies Matthew xxiii.

That day upon Jerusalem fell
Bot tiddius it were to tell
The great extreme confusioun
And of blude, sic effusioun
Was never slane so money ane man
At one time, sen the world began
The Iowis that day gat their desire
Quhilk they did ask, in to their ire
As been in Scripture, specifyit
The day quhen Christ was Crucifyit
Quhen Ponce Pylat, the precedent
Said to them, I am Innocent Math. xxvii

Off the Just Blude, of Christ Jesus
They cryit, his Blude lycht upon ws
And on our Generatioun
They gat their Supplicatioun
That day, with money cairfull cry
Their blude was sched abundantly
Josephus wryttith in his buke
His Cronicle quho list to luke
During that creuell Sege certane
Were alewin hundredth thousand slane
Off Presonaris weill tauld and seen
Four score of thousandis, and sewintene
Out of the land they did expel
All the people of Israel
And for their great Ingratytude
They leif it under Seruytude
Their is no Iow, in no cuntre
Quhilk hes one fute of property
Nor never had, withouttin weir
Sen this day fyuetene hundredth eir
Nor never sall, I to the schaw
Till that they turn to Christis law

As Judas sauld the King of Glore
For thretty pennyis, and no more
After that money were myscheuit
Quhen nouelles past, quhow lang they leuit
Apone their Gold, withouttin doubt
They slyt their bellyis, to sers it out
The rest in Egypt, they did send
Presonaris, to their lyuis end

Great nummer, of the most worthy
With him to Rome, he led them bound
Syne creuelly did them confound

And for agmentyng of his glore

Quhare all folk, mycht behald their facis

Because that in the time of Peace

As did David of Scotland king
The quhilk did found, during his ryng
Fyftene Abbayis, with temporal landis
Withouttin teindis and offerandis
Be quhose holy simplicite
He left the Crown in pouerte
Now haif I schawin the as I can
Quhow their temporal Impyre began
Ascendyng up aye gre by gre
Abufe the Emprioures Majesty
So quhen they gat amang their handis
Off Italy, all the Empriours landis
After that, in ilke cuntrie
Sprang up their temporalite
With so great riches, and sic rent
That they began to be negligent
In making Ministratioun
To Christis true Congregatioun
And tuke no more pain, in their precheing
And far les travel, in their recheing
Changeing, their Spiritualitie
In temporal Sensuality
Father thynk e that they ar sure Cour.

That their Impyre sall lang endure
Apperandlye, it may be kende
Quod he, their glore sall have ane end Exp^.

I mean their temporal Monarchy
Sall turn in till humylitie
Throuch Goddis wourde, without debait
They sall turn, to their first estait
As Daniellis Prophecy apperis
Thareto sall nocht be money eris
Quhowbeit Christis faith, sall never faill
Bot more and more, it sall preuaill
Thocht Christis, true congregatioun

For Christ in his last conuentioun
The day of his Ascentioun
Till his Disciplis gaif command
That they should pass, in every land
To teache and preche, with true intent
His law, and his commandiment
None other office, he to them gaif
He did nocht bid them seik nor craif
Cors presents, nor offerandis
Nor get Lordschipis of temporal landis
Bot now it may be hard and seen
Both with thine eiris, and thine eine
Quhow Prelatis now in every land
Takis lytill cure of Christ's command
Another in to their deidis nor sawis
Neglectyng their awin Canon lawis
Vsyng them selfis contrarious
For the most part to Christ Jesus
Mat. iiii.
Christ thocht no schame to be ane Precheour
And till all people, of truth ane techeour
Ane pope, byschope, nor Cardinal
To teache nor preche, will nocht be thrall
They send forth Freris for to preche for them
Quhilk garris the people now abhor them
Christ wald nocht be ane temporal king Ihon.vi.

And causit his Clergy, for to sing

SVPER Aspidem and basiliscum ambulabis:

Than said this humyll Empriour

Quhen that his Sanctytude serene

For with his feit he did him crown
Syne with his fute, the crown dang down

And to make Empriouris and kyngis
And Syne depryue them of their Ryngis

Apperandlye be my Judgment
That Pope red never the new Testament
Gyf he had lernit at that lore
He had refusit sic vain glore

And rycht so Christis Disciplis all

And all the people with their auyse

Off quhilk they were so discontent
That they their clothyng raif and rent
And Paull amang them rudely ran
Sayand I am ane mortal man

Sen Peter and Paull, vain glore refusit
With Popis quhy sulde sic glore be vsit

And Christis true Disciplis all
Be Goddis word, their faith defendit
To byrne, and skald, they never pretendit
The pope defendis his traditioun
Be flammand fire without remissioun
Quhowbeit men breik the law Divine
They ar nocht put to so great pyne
For huredome, nor Ydolatrye
For Incest nor Adultrye
Or quhen oung Virginnis ar deflorit
For sic thing, men ar nocht abhorit
Bot quho that eitis flesche in to lene

FATHER (said I) quhat rewll keip they i^ rome
Quhilk hes the Spiritual Dominatioun
And Monarchy, abufe all Christindome
Schaw me I make ow supplicatioun
Expe.
My Son, wald I make true narratioun
(Said he) to Peter, and Paul, thocht they succeid
I thynk they preue nocht that in to their deid.
For Peter Androw and Iohne war fyscheares fine
Off men and women to the christin faith
Bot they haif spread their Net with huik and line
On rentis rich, on gold, and other graith
Sic fyscheing to neglect they wylbe laith
For quhy, yai haif fyscheit in ouerthort ye strandis
Ane great part trewlye of all temporal landis
With that the tent part of all good mouebyll
For the vphaldyng of their digniteis
So been their fyscheing, wounder profitabyll
On the dry land als weill as on the seis
Their herywalter, they spread in all countries
And with their hois nett, daily drawis to Rome
The most fine gold, that is in Christindome
I dar weill say, within this fyftie eir
Rome hes ressett forth of this Regioun
For Bullis and Benefyce (quhilk they by full deir)
Quhilk mycht full weil haif payit a kings ranso^n
Bot war I worthy for to weir ane crown
Preistis should no more, our substance so consume
Sendyng eirlye so great riches to Rome
In to their Tramalt nett, they fangit ane fysche
More nor ane quhaill worthy of memory
Of quhome they have had money dayntay dysche
Be quhome they ar exaltit to great glory
That marvelous monstour, callit Purgatory
Howbeit till ws, it is nocht amyable
It hes to them been very profitable.
Latt they that fructfull fysche eschaip their nett.
Be quhome they haif so great commoditeis
Ane more fatt fysche, I traist they sall nocht get
Thocht they wald sers, ouerthort the occiane seis
Adieu the daily dolorous Derigeis
Selye pure preistis may sing with heart full sorye
Want they that painful palyce Purgatory.
Fairweill Monkrye, with Chanoun Nun, and Freir
Allace they wylbe lychtleit in all landis
Cowlis will no more be kend in kirk nor queir
Lat they ye fructfull fysche, eschaip their handis
I counsall them to bynd him fast in bandis
For Peter, Androw, nor Iohne culde never get
So profitable ane Fysche in to their nett.
Their Merchandyce, in till all Nationis.
As prentit led, their walx, and perchement
Their pardonis and their Dispensationis
They do exceid sum temporal princis rent
In sic trafyke, they ar nocht neglygent
Off benefyce they make good marchandyce
Throuch Symonye quhilk they hald lytill vice
Ioh. xxi.
Christ did command Peter to feid his scheip
And so he did feid them full tenderlye
Off that command they take bot lytill keip
Bot Christis scheip, they spole petuouslye
And with the woll they cleith them curiouslye
Lyk gorma^d wolfis, they tak of them their fude
Thai eit yair flesche, and drynkes boith mylk and blude
For that office they serve bot lytill hyir.
I thynk sic Pastoures, ar nocht for to pryse
Quhilk can nocht gyde yare scheip about ye myir
They ar so besye in their merchandyse
Mat. xvi.
Thocht Peter was porter of Paradyse
That plesand passage craftelye they close
Throuch them rycht few gettes entres I suppose
Mathow.xxiii.
Christ Jesus said (as Matthew did report
Woe be to Scribes, and to Pharisience
The quhilkis did close, of Paradyse the port
Off them we haif the sam experience
To enter their; they make small deligence
They tak sic cure in temporal besynes
Rychtso from ws they stop the plane entres.
Those spiritual keis quhilkes Christ to Peter gaif
Their color cleir with reik, and rowst ar fadit
Vnoccupyit they hald them in their neif
Off that office they serve to be degradit
With Goddis word without that they remeid it
Oppinyng ye port quhilk la^g time hes been closit
That we may enter with them and be reiosit.
Contrar till Christis Instytutioun
To them that deis, in habit of ane Freir John.x.

Rome hes them grantit full remissioun
To pass till heuin, straucht way withoutin weir
Quhilk been in Scotland vsit money ane eir
Be their sic vertew in ane Freris hude.
I thynk in vane, Christ Jesus sched his blude.
Wald God the Pope quhilk hes pre-eminence
With advise of his counsall general
That they wald do their detfull deligence
That Christis law mycht keipit be ouir all
And trewlye precheit both to great and small
And give to them Spiritual Auctorite
Quhilk culde perfytlie schaw the Verite.
Quho can not preche a priest sulde not be namit
As may be preuit be the law Divine
And be the Canon law, they ar defamit
That takis Preistheid, bot only to that fine
Till all vertew their hartis they should inclyne
In special to preche with true intentis
And minister the neidfull Sacramentis.
As for their Monkis their chanounis and their Freris
And lustye Ladyis of Religioun
I know nocht quhat to their office efferis
Bot men may se their great abusioun
They ar nocht like, in to conclusioun
Another in to their wourdis nor their warkis
To the Apostolis, Prophets, nor Patriarkis.
Give presentlye their Prelates can nocht preche
Than latt ilke Byschope haif ane Suffragane
Or successor, quhilk can the people teache
On their expensis eirlye to remane
To cause the people from their vice refrane
And quhen ane prelate, hapnith to deceace
Than put ane perfyte precheour in his pleace
Do they nocht so, on them sall ly the charge
Geueand unable men auctorite
As quho wald make ane steirman till ane barge
Off ane blind borne, quhilk can no dainger so
Give that schyp drown, forsuth I say for me
Quho gaif that steirman sic commissioun
Should of the schip, make restitutioun
The humane Lawis, that are contrarius.
And nocht conformyng to the Law divine
They should expel and hald them odius
Quhen they persaue, them cum to no good syne
Inuentit bot be sensual mennis Ingyne
As that law quhilk forbiddis marriage
Causyng oung Clerkis byrne in lustis rage
Difficill is Chaistite till observe. Romans vi^.

But special grace, lauboure, and abstinence
In till our flesche, aye ryngith till we sterue
That first Original syn, Concupiscence
Quhilk we throuch Adamis Inobedience
Hes done Incur, and sall endure for ever
Quhill that our saull and body deith disseuer
Tharefor God maid of Marriage the band
In Paradyse (as Scripture doith record) Gene. ii.

In Galelie rycht so I understand
Was marriage honourit be Christ our Lord Ihon.ii.

Auld Law, and New, their to they do concord
I thynk for me, better that they had sleipit
Nor till have maid ane law, and never keipit
Tuke nocht Christ Jesus his Humanity, Math, i.

Off ane Virgene, in marriage contractit
And of her flesche, cled his Diuynitie Luc. i

Quhy haif they done that blysfull band deiectit
In their Kingdom, wald God it were correctit
That oung prelattis, mycht mary lustye wyffis
And nocht in sensual lust, to leid their lyffis.
Did nocht Christ cheis, of honest maryit men.
Als weill as they that kepit Chaistitie
For to be his Disciplis as e ken
As in the Scripture cleirlye they may se
They keipit still their wyffis with honest
As Peter, and his spousit Bretherin all
Obseruit Chaistitie Matrymoniall.

Quhow sum should ryis, in to the latter aige

Sum hangit, sum doith lose their heidis
Sum brynt, sum soddin in to leiddis
And sum for their vnleifsum actis
Ar rent and rewin apone the ractis
Sum ar dissoluit by poysoun
Sum on the nycht ar murdreist down
Sum fallis in to frynasie
Sum deis in Idropesie
And vtheris strange Infirmeteis
Quharein money ane thousand deis

Sum deith be extreme excess
Off Joy, as Valeri doith express
Sum be extreme Malancolye

In battle, and quhow money one man
Apone the sea, doith lose their lyuis
Quhen schyppis apone roches ryuis
Thocht sum de Naturally throuch aige
Fer mo deis raiffand in one raige
Happy is he, the quhilk hes space
At his last hour, to cry for grace
Quhowbeit deith be abhominabyll
I thynk it should be confortabyll
Till all them of the faithful nummer
For they depart from cair and cummer
From trubyll travel, sturt, and strife
Till Joy and euirlestand life
Polidorus Virgilius
To that effect, he wryttis thus
In Trace, quhen any child be borne
Their kyn, and freindis, cumis them beforne
With dolent Lamentatioun
For the great trybulatioun
Calamitye cummer and cure
That they in earth, ar to endure
Bot at their deith and burying
They make great Joy and Bankettyng
That they have past from misarie
To rest and grett felycitie.
Sen deith been fynall conclusioun
Quhat valis warldly prouisioun
Quham wisdom may nocht contramand
Nor strenth that stoure may nocht ganestand
Ten thousand Myleone of treasoure
May nocht prolong thy life one hour
After quhose dolent departing
Thy spreit sall pass but tarying
Straucht way till Joy Inestimabyll
Or to strange pane Intollerabyll
Thy vile corruptit carioun
Sall turn in Putrefactioun
And so remane in pulder small
On to the Judgment General.
FINIS
Ane schort discriptio^n Of the Antechriste.
Cour.
QVOD I) Father I heir men say.
That their sall rise affore ye day
Quhilk e call general Judgment
One wyckit man from satan sent
And contrar to the law of Christ
Callit the creuell Antechrist
And sum sayis that myscheuous man
Discende sall of the Trybe of Dan
And should be borne in Babilone
The quhilk dissaue sall money one
Infydelis sall of every art
With that falls Propheit tak one part
And quhow that Enoch, and Elias
Sall preche contrar that falls Messiah
Bot finally his false Doctrine
And he sall be put to rewyne
Bot another be the fire nor swourd
Bot be the vertew of Christis wourd
And gyf this be of veryte
The suith I pray ow schaw to me
My Son (said he) as wryttis Iohne Expe.

Their sall nocht be one man allone
Having that name in special
Bot Antechristis in general
Hes been, and now ar money one
And rycht so in the time of Iohne i. John.ii

Were Antechristis as him self sayis
And presentlye now in their dayis
Ar rycht money withouttin dout
Were their falls lawis weill souchtout.
Quha was one greter Antechrist
And more contraryous to Christ
Nor the false Propheit Machomeit
Quhilk his curste Lawis, maid so sweit
In Turkye, it they ar obseruit
Quhare throuch the hell, he hes deseruit
All Turkis, Sarazenis, and Iowis
That in the Son of God nocht trowis
Ar Antechristis, I the declare ii. John.i

Because to Christ they ar contrare.
Dan. viii
Daniell sayis in his propheseis
That after the great Monarcheis
Sall rise ane marvelous potent King
Quhilk with ane schameles face sall ryng
Mychtie and wise in dirk speikyngis
And prospir in all plesand thyngis
Throuch his falsheid and craftynes
He sall flow in to welthynes
The Godly pepyll he sall noye
By creuell deith, and them distroye
The king of Kyngis, he sall ganestand
Syne be distroyit withouttin hand.
Tessa. ii
Paull sayis affore the Lordis cumyng
That their salbe one departing
And that man of Iniquitye
Till all men he sall opened be
Quhilk sall sit in the holy sait
Contrary God, to make debait
Bot that Son of Perditioun
Salbe put to confusioun
Be power of the haly Spreit
Quhen he his time hes done compleit
Believe nocht that in time cumyng
One gretar Antechriste to ryng
Nor their hes been, and presentlye
Ar now, as Clerkis can espy
Tharefor my will is that thou know
Quhat ever they be, that makis one law
Thocht they be callit Christin men
By natural reassoun thou may ken
Be they never of so great valor
Pape, Cardinal, King, or Empriour
Extolland their Traditionis
Abufe Christis Institutionis
Makand Lawis contrar to Christ
He is ane verray Antechriste
And quho doith fortifye or defend
Sic Law, I make it to the kend
Be it Pape, Empriour, King or Queen
Great sorrow, sall be on them Seen
At Christis extreme Judgment
Without that they in time repent
FINIS.
Heir follouis a schort Remenbrance of the most Terrabyll Day of the extreme
Judgment.
FATHER said I) with our License
Sen e haith sic Experience Cour.

itt one thing at ow wald I speir
Quhen sall that dreidfull day appeir
Quhilk e call Judgment General
Quhat thyngis affore that day sall fall
Quhare sall appeir that Dreidfull Judge?
Or quhow may Faltoures get refuge
(Quod he) as to thy first questioun
I can make no solutioun Expe.

Quharefor perturbe nocht thine intent
To know day, hour, nor moment
To God allone, the day been knawin
Quhilk never was to none Angel schawin
Howbeit be diverse coniectoures
And principal Expositoures
Off Daniell, and his Prophicie
And be the sentence of Elie
Quhilkes hes declarit as they can
How lang it is sen the world began
And for to schaw, hes done their cure
How lang they traist it sall endure
And als how money ages been
As in their warkis may be seen
Bot till declare their questionis
Their been diverse opinionis
Sum wryttares hes the world deuidit
In sex ageis, (as been desidit
Into Fasciculus Temporum
And Cronica Cronicarum)
Bot be the sentence of Elie
The world deuydit is in three
As cunnyng Master Carioun
Hes maid plane expositioun
How Elie sayis withouttin weir
The world sall stand sax thousand eir
Off quhome I follow the sentence
And lattis the other Bukes go hence
From the Creatioun of Adam
Two thousand eir till Abraham
From Abraham, be this narratioun
To Christis Incarnatioun
Rychtso hes been two thousand eris
And be their Prophiceis apperis
From Christ, as they make till ws kend
Two thousand till the warldlis end
Off quhilkes ar by gone sickirlye
Five thousand, five hundredth, three and fyftye
And so remanis to cum but weir
Four hundredth, with sewin and fourtye eir
And than the Lord Omnipotent
Should cum till his great Judgment
Christ sayis the time salbe maid schort Mathow.xxiiii.

As Matthew planelye doith report
That for the warldlis Iniquite
The letter time, sall schortnit be
For plesour of the chosin nummer
That they may pass, from care and cummer
So be this count it may be kend
The world is drawand neir ane end
For legionis ar cum but doubt
Off Antechristes, were they soucht out
And money toknis dois appeir
As after schortlye thou sall heir
Quhow that Sanct Iherome doith indyte
That he hes red, in Hebrew write
Off fyftene signis in special
Affore that Judgment General
Off sum of them, I tak no cure
Quhilk I find nocht in the scripture
One part of them thocht I declare
First will I to the Scripture fare
Mar. xiii
Christ sayis, affore that day be done
Matthew.xiiii.
Their salbe signis, in Son and Moan
The Son sall hyde his beymes brycht
So that the Moon, sall gyf no lycht
Sterris be mennis Judgment
Sall fall forth of the Firmament
Off this signis, or we forther gone
Sum moral sense, we will expone
As cunnyng Clerkis hes declarit
And hes the Son, and Moan comparit
The Son to the stait spiritual
The Moon, to Princis temporal
Rychtso the sterris, they do compare
To the lawd common populare
The Moon and sterris hes no lycht
Bot the reflex of Phoebus brycht
So quhen the Son of lycht is dyrk
The Moon and sterris, man be myrk
Rychtso quhen Pastouris spirituallis
Popis, Byschopis, and Cardinallis
In their beginning schew great lycht
The Temporal stait, was rewlit rycht
Bot now allace, it is nocht so
Those schynand Lampis been ago
Their Radious beymes, ar turnit in reik
For now in earth, no thing they seik
Except riches, and Dignity
Followyng their sensuality
Money prelatis, ar now ryngand
The quhilkes no more dois understand
Quhat doith pertene to their office
Nor thou can kendyll fire with ice
Woe to Papis, I say for me
Quhilk sufferis sic Enormite
That Ignorant warldly creaturis
Should in the kirk, haif any curis
No marvel thocht the people slide
Quhen they have blind men to their gyde
For ane Prelat, that can nocht preche
Nor Goddis law, to the people teache
Esaye, comparith him in his wark Esaias.lvi.

Till ane dum Dog, that can nocht bark
And Christ him callis in his grief
Most like ane murdrer, or ane theif John.x.

The cunnyng Doctor Augustyne
Wolfis and Deuyllis, doith them defyne
The Canon Law, doith him defame
That of ane Prelat beris the name
And will nocht preche the Divine Lawis
As the Decreis planelye schawis
Bot those that hes Auctorite
To provide spiritual Dignyte
Mycht give they plesit to tak pane
Gar them lycht all their Lampis agane
Bot ever allace, that is nocht done
So dirknit been boith Son and Moan
War Kyngis lyuis weill declarit
The quhilkes ar to the Moon comparit
Men mycht consydder their estate
From Charity degenerate
I thynk, they sulde thynk mekle schame
Off Christ for to tak their Surname
Syne leif nocht like to Christianis
Bot more like Turkis, and to Paganis
Turk contrar Turk, makis lytill weir
Bot Christian Princis, takis no feir
Quhilkes should aggre as brother to brother
Bot now ilk ane dyngis down ane other
I know no ressonabyll cause quharefore
Except Pride, Couatyce, and vain glore
The Empriour mouis his Ordinance
Contrar the potent King of France
And France rychtso, with great regour
Contrar his freinde the Empriour
And rycht swa France agane Ingland
Ingland alsso aganis Scotland
And als the Scotts, with all their mycht
Doith feycht for till defend their rycht
Betuix their Realms of Albione
Quhare Battellis hes been money one
Can be maid none Affinity
Nor it no Consanguinitie
Nor be no way, they can consydder
That they may have lang Peace to gydder
I dreid that weir makes none endyng
Till they be boith onder ane king
Thocht Christ, the Souerane king of grace
Left in his Testment lufe and peace
Our Kings from weir will nocht refrane
Till their be money ane thousand slane
Great heirschipis maid be see and land
As all the world may understand
Father I thynk that temporal kyngis
May fecht for till defend their ryngis (...)

For I haif seen the spiritual stait
Make weir their rychtis till debait
I saw Pape Julius manfullye
Pass to the field tryumphantlye
With ane rycht aufull ordinance
Contrar Lues, the king of France
And for to do him more dispyte
He did his Regioun interdyte
My Son (said he) as I suppose Expe.

That langith weill till our purpose
How Soune and Moan, ar boith denude
Off lycht, as Clerkis dois conclude
Comparyng them, as e hard tell
To Spiritual stait, and Temporell
And commoun people half disparit

And specially in to their deidis

Quhat d^is auaill religious wedis
Quhen they ar contrar in their dedis
Quhat holiness is their within
Ane wolf, cled in ane Wodderes skin

All herb and tree, sall sweit lyk blude

And in their manner make great moan

Quhen they se roches schaik in schounder
Throw trimlyng of the earth and quakyng
Off sorrow than salbe no slakyng
Quho that been leuand in those dayis

And sum men saland on the sey

Without that e be penitent
With Phitonissa, I heir tell
Quhilk rasit the Spreit of Samuel
That day with her their sall resort
Off rank Wycheis, one sorrowful sort
Brocht from all partis money one mile
From Sauoy, Athell, and Argyle
And from the ryndes of Galloway
With money woeful Wallaway.
e Brether of Religioun
In time leif our abusioun
With quhilk e haif the world abusit
Or e that day salbe refusit
I speik to ow all generallye
Nocht till one Ordoure specially
That day all Creature sall ken
Give e war Sanctis or warldly men
Or gyf e tuk the Skapellarye

And get ane good gross Portioun
Or for Godly Deuotioun
That day our f^ynit Sanctytudis

That day, sall stand ow in no stead
For cowlis blak, gray, nor begaird

That day, they sall be cleirlye knawin
Quhen e sall scheir, as e have sawin
Tharefore in time, be penitent
Or ellis that day, e wylbe schent
I pray ow hartlie as I may
Remember on that dreidfull day
e Abbot, Pryor, and Pryores
Consydder quhat e did profes
And quhow that our promotioun
Was no thing for deuotioun
Bot till obtene the Abbasye

Off powertie, and obedience
Tharefor remord our conscience
Quhow their three wowis been obseruit
And quhat reward, e have deseruit
Quharefore repent, quhill e have space
Sen God is lyberall of his grace,
Father (quod I) declare to me Cour.

Quhare sall our Prelatis ordorit be
Quhilk now been in the world leuand
With quhome sall cum that Spiritual band?
(Quod he) as sanct Barnard discryuis
Expe.
Without that they amend their lyuis
And leif their wantoun vicious warkis
Nocht with Prophetis nor Patriarkis
Nocht with Martyris, nor Confessouris
The quhilkes to Christ, were true prechouris
Their Predecessouris, Peter, and Paull
That day will them mysken at all
So sall they nocht, I say for me
With the Apostlis, ordourit be
I traist they sall dwell on the bordour
Off Hell, quhare their salbe non ordour
Endlang the Flude of Flagitone
Or on the brais of Acherone
Cryand on Caron, I conclude
To far them over, that furious flude
Till eternal confusioun
Without they leif their abusioun
I traist those Prelates, more and les
Sall make cleir count of their riches
That dreidfull day, with hartis sore
And quhat service, they did tharefore
The Princely pomp, nor apparel
Off Pope, Byschope, nor Cardinal
Their Royal Rentis, nor Dignite
That day sall nocht regardit be
Their sall no talis, as I heir say
Off Byschoppis, be borne up that day
Cum they nocht with their conscience clean
On them great sorrow salbe seen
Without that they their life amend
In time, and so I make ane end.

For my saik maid them no supply
Refusand them, e me refusit
With wrecheitnes, so e were abusit
Tharefor e sall have to our hyre

But grace, but peace, or confortyng
Than sall they cry, full sore weipyng
That we were maid, allace good Lord
Allace, is their non Misericorde
But thus withouttin hope of grace
Tyne presens of thy plesand face
Allace for ws, it had been good
We had been smorit in our cude.
Than with one rair, the earth, sall ryue
And swolly them boith man and wyue
Than sall those Creaturis forlorn
Wary the hour, that they were borne
With money amer, ewt and ell
From time they feill, the flammis fell
Apone their tender bodeis byte
Quhose torment salbe Infinyte
The earth sall close, and from their sycht
Sall taking be, all kind of lycht
Their salbe gowlyng, and gretyng
But hope of any confortyng
In that Inestimabyll pane
Eternallye they sall remane
Byrnand in furious flammys read
Ever deand, bot neuir be deed
That the small Minuth of one hour
To them salbe so great dolor
They sall thynk they haif done remane
Ane thousand eir, in to that pane
Allace I trimyll till heir tell
The terribyll Turmentyng of hell
That panefull pytt, quho can deplore
Quhilk mon endure, for ever more
Than sall those glorifyit Creaturis
With mirth and infinyte plesouris

Pass to the Heuin Imperial
With Christ Jesus, our Souerane King
In glore, Eternallye to ryng
Off man, quhilk passis the Ingyne
The thousand part, for till defyne
Allanerlie of the leist plesoure
Preordinat for one Creature.
ii Pet. iii.
Than sall one Fire, as Clerkis sane
Make all the hyllis and valais plane
From earth, up to the Heuin Impyre
All beis renewit, by that fire
Purgeyng all thing material
Under the heuin Imperial
Boith earth, and walter, fire, and air,
Salbe more perfyte maid and fair
The quhilkes affore had myxit been
Sall than be purifyit and maid clean
The earth like Crystal salbe cleir
And euerilk Planeit, in his speir
Sall rest withouttin more moueyng
Boith sterny heuin, and Christellyng
The first and hiest heuin monabyll
Sall stand but turnyng firm and stabyll
The Son in to the Orient

Rest sall the Moon, and be more cleir
Nor now been Phoebus, in his speir
And als that Lantern, of the Heuin
Sall gyf more lycht, be greis sewin
Nor it gave sen the world began
The Heuin renewit salbe than
Rychtso the earth, with sic deuyse
Compair till heuinlye Paradyse,
So heuin and earth salbe allone Apo. xxi.

As menith the Apostill Iohne
The great sey sall no more appeir
Bot like the Crystal pure and cleir
Passing Imaginatioun i. Cor. ii

Off Man, to make narratioun
Off glore, quhilk God, haith done prepair

With heart it is vnthynkabyll
And with toungis Inpronunciabyll
Quhose plesouris, salbe so perfyte
Haueyng in God, so great delight
ii Pet. iii.
The space now of one thousand eir
That time sall nocht, one hour appeir
Quhilk can nocht comprehendit be
Till we that plesand sycht sall se.
ii. Cor. xii
Quhen Paull was reuyst in the spreit
Till the third Heuin, of glore repleit
He sayith, the Secretis quhilk he saw
They were nocht leifsum for to schaw
To no man on the earth leueand
Quharefor preis nocht till understand
Quhowbeit their to thou haif desire
The Secretis of the heuin Impyre
The more men lukis on Phoebus brycht
The more febyll, salbe their sycht
Rychtso latt no man set their cure
To Sers, the heych Divine Nature
The more men study, I suppose
Salbe the more from their purpose
To know, quhareto sulde men Intend
Quhilk Angellis can nocht comprehend
Bot after this great Judgment
All thing till ws salbe patent
Latt ws with Paull, our mind addres
He beand full of Heuinlynes
Full humilye, he techeit ws
Nocht for to be to curious
Quhowbeit men be of great Ingyne
To seik the heych Secretis Divine
Quhose Iugementes ar vncersiabyll Romans xi.

And strange wayis Inuestigabyll
(That is to say) past out fynding
Off quhome no man may find endyng
It sufficith ws for till Implore
Great God, to bring ws to that glore.
FINIS.
Off certane plesouris of the glorifeit bodeis.
SEn their is non in earth, may comprehend
The Heuinlye glore, and plesouris Infinyte
Quhairfor my Sone, I pray yt not pretend Expe.

Over far to seik, that manner of delight
Quhilk passit Natural reasoun to Indyte
That God affore that he the world creatt
Preparit to them, quhilk ar predestinat.
All Mortal men, salbe maid Immortal
(That is to say) never to de agane
Impassabyll, and so Celestial
That fire, nor swerd, may do to them no pane
Nor hete, nor called, nor frost, nor wynd, nor rane
Thocht sic thing were, may do to them no deir
Those Creaturis, rycht so salbe als cleir
As flammand Phoebus in his Mantioun
Considder than, gyf their salbe great lycht
Quhen every one, in to that Regioun
Sall schyne like to the Son, and be als brycht
Lat ws with Paull, desire to se that sycht
To be dissoluit, Paull had A great desire
With Christ, to be in till the heuin Impyre.
And more attour, as Clerkis can discryue.
Their marvelous myrthis, beis incomparabyll
Amang the rest, in all their wyttis five
They sall have sensual plesouris delectabyll
The heuinlye sound, quhilk salbe Innarrabyll
In their eris, continuallye sall ryng
And als the sycht of Christ Jesus our King.
In his tryumphant throne Imperial
With his Mother, ye Virgene Queen of quenis
Their salbe seen, the Court Celestial
Apostolis, Martyris, Confessoris, and Virgenis
Brychtar than Phoebus, in his speir that, schynis
The Patriarkis, and Prophetis, Venerabyll
Their salbe seen, with glore Inestimabyll.
And with their Spiritual Eis salbe seen.
That sycht, quhilk been most Superexcelland
God as he is, and evermore hes been
Continuallye, that sycht contempland
Augustyne sayis, he had lever tak on hand
To be in Hell, he seeing the assence
Off God, nor be in Heuin, but his presence.
Quho seis God, in his Diuynitie.
He seis in him, all other plesand thyngis
The quhilk with tongue, can nocht pronuncit be
Quhat plesour been, to se that king of Kyngis,
The gretest pane, yt dampnit folk dounthryngis
And to the Deuyllis, the most punytioun
It is of god, to want fruitioun.
And mairattour, they sall feill sic ane smell.
Surmountyng far, the fleure of erthly flowris
And in their mouth, ane taist as I heir tell
Off sweit, and Supernatural Sapowris
As they sall se the heuinlye brycht colowris
Schenyng amang those Creaturis Divine
Quhilk till discryue, tra^scendith ma^nis Ingyne
And als they sall haif sic agilitie.
In one Instant to pass for their plesour
Ten thousand mylis in twynkling of one E
So their Ioyis salbe without missour
They sall Reioyis, to se the great dolor
Off dampnit folk in hell, and their torment
Because of God it is the Just Judgment.
Subtellyte they sall have maruellouslye
Subponyng that their were ane wall of bras
One glorifeit body, may rycht haistellye
Out throw that wall, without Impediment pas
Siclyke as doith the Sone baime throw ye glass
As Christ till his Disciplis did appeir
All entres clos, and non of them did steir.
i. Cor. xv
Quhowbeit in heuin, thocht euerilk Creature
Have nocht alyke filicitie nor glore
itt euerilk one sall haif so great pleasure
And so content, they sall desire no more
To have more Joy, they sall no way Implore
Bot they salbe all satyfeit and content
Like to this rude exempyll subsequent,
Tak ane crowat, one pynte stope, and one quart
One galloun pitschair, one puntioun and one twn
Of wine, or balm, gyf euerilk one their part
And fill them full, till that they be ouir rwn
The lytill crouat, in comparisoun
Salbe so full, that it may hald no more
Off sic missouris, thocht their be twenty score.
In to the Twn, or in the Pontioun,
So all those vesschellis, in one quality
May hald no more, without they be ouir rwn
itt haif they nocht, alyke in quantity
So be this rude exempyll thou may se
Thocht euerilk one, be nocht alyke in glore
Ar satyfeit, so that they desire no more
Thocht presentlye be Goddis prouiance.
Beistis fowlis, and fyschis, in the seis
Ar necessar now, for mannis sustenance
With cornis, herbis, flowris, and fructfull treis
Than sall their be non sic commoditeis
The earth sall beir no plant, nor beist brutall
Bot as the Heuinnis brycht like burial
Suppone sum be on earth, walkand heir down,
Or heycht abone, quhare ever they pleis to go
Off God, they have ay cleir fruitioun
Boith est, or west, up down, or to, or fro
Clerkis declaris plesouris money mo
Quhilk dois transcend al mortal ma^nis Ingyne
The thousand part, of those plesouris deffyne.
In to the Heuin, they sall perfytlie know.
Their tender freindis, yare father and yare mother
Their Predecessouris, quhilkes they never saw
Their spousis, bairnis, sister, and their brother
And euerilk one, sall have sic lufe till other
Off vtheris glore, and Joy, they sall rejoice
As of their awin, as Clerkis doith suppose
Than salbe seen, that brycht Jerusalem. Apoc. xxi

Quhilk Ihone saw, in his Reuelatione
Esa. lxvi
We mortal men, allace ar far to blame
That will nocht haif consideratione
And one continual contemplatione
With hot desire, to cum on to that glore
Quhilk plesour sall endure for ever more.
To. viii.
O Lord our God, and King Omnipotent.
Quhilk knew, or thou the heuin, and earth, creati
Quho wald to the, be inobedient
And so disarue, for to be Reprobatt
Thou knew the nomer, of predestinat
Quhome thou did call, and hes them Iustifeis
And sall in Heuin with the be Glorifeit.
Grant ws to be Lord, of that chosin sort
Quhame of thy mercy superexcellent
Did puriffy, as scripture doith report
With the blude of that holy Innocent
Jesus, quhilk maid him self Obedient
On to the death, and steruit on the Rude
Lat ws O Lord, be purgit with that blude.

All Creature, that ever God Creat
As wryttis Paull, they wys to se that day
Quhen the Childryng of God predestinat

i. Cor. xv
Quhen Corruptioun, beis clengit clean away
And cheangit beis, their Mortal Quality
In the great glore, of Immortality.
And moreattour all deed thyngis corporal.
Onder the Concaue, of the Heuin Impyre
That now to laubour subject ar and thrall
Sone, Moan, and Sterris, Earth, walter, air, and Fire
In one maneir, they have ane hot desire
Wissing that day, that they may be at rest
As Erasmus, Exponith Manifest.
We se the great Gloube, of the Firmament
Continually, in moueyng marvelous
The Sewin Planetis, contrary their intent
Ar reft about, with coursse contrarious
The wynd, and See, with stormys furious
The trublit Air, with Frostis, Snaw and Rane,
On to that day, they travel ever in pane.
And all the Angellis, of the Ordouris Nine.
Haueand compatioun of our Misareis
They wys after that day, and to that Fine
To se ws fred, from our Infirmiteis
And clengit from their great Calamiteis
And trublus life, quhilk never sall have end
On to that day I make it to the kend.

And rauis yame from yare rent, riches and ringis
Tharefor, on Christ confirm thine hole intent
And of thy calling, be rycht weill content

With dolor, dreid, and desolatioun

To this unhap, all subject ar and thrall
Quhilk Misary but doubt sall ever endure
Till the last day, my Son thareof be sure.
That day, as I have maid narratioun

And of thy guddis, tak plesandlye thy part.
Off our talkeing, now latt ws make ane end.
Behald quhow Phoebus, dounwart dois descend

In till her wattry Regioun till ascend
With vissage paill, up from the Orient

Off Phoebus heit, now cratftelly ar closit

And ceissis of their heuinlye armoneis

Tak patience (said he) it moan be so
Perchance I sall return, with deligence
Thus I departit, from Experience.
And sped me home, with heart sychyng full sore
And enterit in my quiet Oritore

All gentle Redaris, hertlye I Implore
