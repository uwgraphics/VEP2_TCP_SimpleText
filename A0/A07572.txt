And there shall be dyvers accusers both above him and byneth him And on

so accuse them of the least thought that ever was amys. On the right side his

deem the rich people for the great wrounges that they did to them. and they
might get none a men des tylle the day of dome then they shall have their
will of the rich people for when the rich done the poor wrong: they can
do no more but pray to god to quyte them at the day of dome. And so he will
for god says thus (Michi vindi clametego ^etrib^am) Put all to me / and^ yield
every man after his deservynge / therefore while yeben here make ye amends for
your wyckednes / And make them y^* friends that shall be your domys men at the
day of dome and trust not to them that shall come after you / lest ye be
begyled And dread the pain of of hell / that never shall have end.



Saint Bid tells how there was an housbonde man in England that fill syke /
and ley dedefram the evyn till on the morrow. Then ne he rose and departed his
gods in four parties and all his own part he gave to pour men / and went
and was a monk ^n an abbey that was nygh the water side. Into the which water
he went every night / were it never so cold and stood therein long / and
suffered great penance. And when he was asked why he did so to suffer that
great penance / He said to esche we a greter peyn that he had seen. And he
would ete but barley bread and drynk water all his life after. And told two
religyous men the peynes that he had seen and they were so great that they
cowde not tell them openly. He said that an angel ^ad him to a place there
yt* one side was so cold that no tongue might tell the pain thereof. And ye.
other side was so hot that no man might tell the pain thereof and souls were
cast out of that one into that other and that was a great pain to them. And
the angel showed him ye. fire that came out of hell that was sooho^ / And so
far as him thought he might see it / he thou ghtal bren^ him* and in the ^eme
thereof / hesawe souls boil up and down cryeng and waylyng for woo / Also he
herd fendes cry / cast out hole led and brymstone to make herpeynes gretter
/ and so they tormented the souls in pey^e

Now lord god for thy great mercy have mercy on us / and keep us ^ro thoo
peynes / and bring us to the bliss of heven / that never shall have endyng

Amen.
Dominica in septuagessima.
Good men and wymmen this day is called in holy church / ye sunday in
septuagesme / Forcause^^* holy church is mother of allerysten people / she
takes good head to the children as a good mode^ owes to do and ^orasmo^he as
she sees hem full sore syke in sin / and many of them wounded to ye. with
the swe^d of sin / the which synne^ has caught all this ye^^ to fore / And
namely this cr^stmas time yt. was ordained in holy dryrch for great solemn
p^^yte / for every man should be besy to serve god with all his power / because
that cr^ste himself she wed that day swetnes of love to all christian people /
For man he was borne yt. time / And in the same flessh and blood as one ^f us /
and laid in a cradell more pourly than any of us / and was crystened in water
as any of us. And also he come to a weddyng for to dense it from sin / and to
make us holy and bredern to him and heirs to ye. kingdom of heven. For this
causes all christian people owen to be full glad in their souls as my^. time
making solempnyte and myrthe and making hem both clean in body and soul from
all manner of sins And groundyng them in great sadness of love to god and to
all cryssten people doing great alms to them that have need: But now the more
harm is for that high and solemn pnefes^e is turned into f^llye. sin and
great sykenes to ye soul / as in pride by dyverse wise in clothing / and in
many dyverse gyle usyng / into great covetyse / and into ^echery* that sueth
always gloten ^^ In slewth in god is servyce / as ^apys and vanyte syngyngery
baudry spekyng For vanite causes much slow the for among such people / he is
most worthy yt most charlatry can speak. thus these solemn and high festes
yt. were ordained to great worship of god and of our lady and all the saints
in heven now ben turned into great offense to god / wherefore our mother holy
chircheseying her children in such dyspayre / as a mother full of compass
yons^r^ in her heart for them / this day leyeth down all^luia and other songs
of m^^the and melodye / and takes ^raclus / that been songs of morning / Also
for this holy sacrament of weddyng is much de^oyled by vanyte of sin /
therefore it is leyed do^n this days and in advente. For many that been now
wedded yeveth them all lust and liking of the bodies of fleshely lusle of
this world And thinks full little of the death yt. is full grevous that comes
too soon after. But as it is red by great clerks / it is more spefull to
monnes soul to god / to an house there as is a corpse and weeping / than to go
to an house / there as is a great revel and much myrthe for such things make a
man to foryete his god and himself both / but theras is a sight of a corse
makes a man to think on his death / that is ye specyal thing to put away
sin and vanyte of this world. For Solomon says thus to his son / ^ili
memorare novissima tua and ineternum non pec^^bis / Sone have in thy mind that
thou shall deye^^ thou shall never sin dedely / thus holy church havyng great
compassyon of her children ordeyneth three manner of salves to help and to hele
her children that been to think on death inwardly to labor besely and to
chastyse ye. body resonably the first as to think on death in wardly / holy
chircheyeveth en sample this day in ye office of ye mass Circumdederunt me The
sekenes of death has b^^typped me / this says he techyng every good child to
have in mind how hard he is bestad with death on each side in so much that he
man not seape no way. but eve^ death sueth him with abow drawn and and an
arrow eye^ therein ready to shote him he wot never what time / This is a
pryncypall salve to every man yt. takes it to her t^ to putt away all manner
ofvamyte and vain myrthe / But for to understand this the better I show this
by ensample.



I read of a king yt. ever was in hevy sorrow and he would never laughe ne make
merry ^here / but ever was in morning and in hevyness / therefore his mayny and
all other men were greved / there with they yede ^o ye. kings brode^ / prayng
him to speak to the king / ^ said he greved all thoo yt were about him with
his hevy chere / and counseled him to leve it and make ^yght chere in time
coming / Then was this king wise and thought to chastyse his brother by a
while / and wrothly bad him goo home and do that he had to do Then was the
manner of ye. country that when a man should be done to death / should come
trompetts and trompe before his gate. Then said the king byddyng them goo
trompe before his broders gate. and men goo with them to arreste him / and
bring him before the king / And in the mean while / the king called unto
him seven men that he tru^ on / and bad them that when his brother was come /
to draw her swerdes and set them at his breast before his heart.

So when his brother was come they did as the king bad hem. than the king
commanded all men to dance and to make revell all that they could and so they
dyden then said ye* king to his brother / why art thou so hevy of chere / heve
up thy head and be merry for all this myrthe is made for the / Then answered he
and said How should I be merry of chere and see here seven swerdes set to my
heart / and wot not who shall be my death first / Then said the king put up
your swerdis / and spoke to his brother thus. It fares by me yt seven dedly
sins be everredy to reve me of my soul to the heart / and this makes me
that I may never be merry and make glad chere / but ever am aferde of death for
my soul yt is the ^yf of my body. Then said ye. brother / lerye thee mercy /
for I knew never this till now and shall be wyser ever after / This I will say
boldly he yt will take this to heart he shall have better will to loure than to
laugh to sygh than to be glad / to weep than to sing so yt he shall find the
mind of death the pryncy pal salve of all manner of sin also princypally we
must have in ne mind ye* peynful death of our savyour yt he suffered for us all
/ of ye which is made me^cyon in ye. first chapter of trenys / Attendite and
videte siest dolor similis sicut dolor meus / That other salve is to labor
besely in this world / of us* labor speaks St. Poull in the pystle of this
day and says / Sic currite ut comprehendatis Renneye so yt. ye may have the
game / by this rennyng ye shall understonde yt. he that run for ye. game
enforsyth himself with all his might to run fast and so must every servant
of god enforce him to labor besely in the degree god has set him in and men
of holy church must labor in studying and prayeng and to teache ye. people the
law of god. Lord is and rentelmen must labor to keep holy church in rest and
peace and other common people must labourlogele lyvyng t^ these other degrees and
fsorhymself both to soul and body And for no man should excuse him from this
labor Christ in the gospel yeveth an ensample sayng thus Primomane conducere
operarios / An husbound man went into his gardeyn or vyneyard at pryme and a
yen at undren or myddaye / and sat even song time. And he hired people to
labor by all ye tides of the day / This is to understonde all ye-grees of ye*
world / For as Job says / A man is borne to labor and traveyle in this world
as a byrd to flee / And saint Bernard says He that will not labor here in this
world / He shall labor with the fendis of hell. For yt, is the testament of
Adam that he left to all his of spring / labor and traveylle / To this
labor he geveth ensample and reherseth how god made Adam and Eve ^o labor to
keep paradyse and bad they mete of all the fruits that was in paradyse / except
one tree that he keep for himself so as ^fte as they saw that tree / they
should think ^n him that made them and know him for their god / And for they
should notete there of inpeyne of dampnacyon Then the fendesawe them in so
much Joye that they were in and himself in so much pain / And woo that he
had great envye to them / and went to Eve: and asked why they ete not of the
fruit of that tree / And she said god has forbede us that tree in peyn of
death Then said the fend / he woteful well that and yeete thereof / ye
should be like god knowing both good and evyll / And if yewyl prove that I say
so the / ete thereof and assaye. Then took Eve of the fruit and gaafadam and bad
him ete thereof and for Adam loved her well / and would not wrath her / took an
apple and ete. And an another with ^yher of them saw others shape and were
asshamed. And took leaves afafygge tree and so ^evered her members. Than come
our lord to adam ^^ayd *Quarefeci^ti hoc* why have thou do so* and he said
(Mulier quamdedisti mich isociam) The woman bad me / Then said our lord to
eve / why did thou this (Serpens decepit me.) The serpent begyld me Then for
they might not deye in paradyse nesuffre no penance / therefore he drafe hem
naked out into this world that is full of wretched weeping and waylyngefull sore
syghynge to goo and gate her mete with great labor and travaylle and deye at
the last. Than prayed Adam our lard weeping / he should not take great
vengeance upon them* but have mercy on them / and pity for they were begyled
byenvy and malice of the fend / and by innocensye of them self that they wist
not what they did.

Then had our lord ruthe on them / and for they were both naked he clothed
them in pylches, and badde them goo labor and traveyle for the^r lyvyng /
And said to Eve (In dolor paries filios) In sorrow and woo shall thou bear thy
children / and took adaminsrumentes to labor with and lest them there. By
this yeshall understond and take ensample to labor b^seley. For and adam and
eve had labored besely / the fend had never overcome them. For the fend
desires no more when he would tempt a man but for to find him idle And
therefore know ye well that it is a rich salv^ against sin for to labor
besdy. The third is to chastyse the body dis^retely. (Unde Paulus. Castigoco^
pus meum etin servi^^te ^edigo) I shall chastysen^y body / and dress it to
service of my soul for man m^^ flesh is so wild and so lusty to sin that
it will not* in no wayeleve his lust to serve god / but if it be chastised
with penance. For it must be chastysed sometime with pain / Thus did adam and
eve in ensample that all other that shall come after hem should do the same for
many years before her death either of them stood in water a nyghtes up to the
^hy^ one serve from another to suffer penance till her fless he was as grene
as grass for cold. Then come y^*fende to eve also bright as an angel / and
said y^* god ha^ sent him from heven* and bad her goo to Adam and say to him
/ that god bad him leve his penance for her hespasse was forgyve. And Eve did
so / but adam wist well yt* it come forth from ye. fend and not from god. He
said to Eve when god drove us out of paradyse for our sin and had compassyon
on us / for we wept sore on him. and prayed him mekely of mercy he setted us
here to penance to ourlyves end. And therefore go again* for the more
penance yt we do ye more shall be our mede. And therefore go again and do thy
penance in god is name* yet the fend come again y^ second lyme and said to
Eve* god of his grace has take reward to your penance yt* ye suffer and has
forgyve you Then went Eve to Adam and told him so. Then said adam / I wot
well yt* he yt* has said so to the is our enemy / for our penance greveth
more him than us and he would have us to leve of and so to lose our mede / but
dowe fourth our penance to our lyves end For god takes none head to ye*
beginning of a thing but to ye* endyng* Yet ye* fend came again ye* third time
to Eve and said / goo thou to adam and say to him yt* he began foul and well
foul will end for first he trespassed by innocence and ^is^eyte of ye* fend
/ and now he synneth by good deliber^cyon and will not do as god byddeth him
wherefore your trespass is worthly dampnacyon. Then was Eve aferd and told adam
so Th^^ adam syked sore and wep^ and sai^ to her on auysyd woman god made the
of one of my rybbys for to help me and comfort me. and now be tysyng of the
fend thou art to combre me again but think how our first sin stancke in
the sight of god that all our ospryng shall be enfecte and have repreue there
of in to the world is end. where for though we might do also much penance
as all our ospryng might do yet hit were to little to quite our lord god
for our tres^asse but god of his special grace a lowythe a good will Than
went eve ayene to her penance as adam bad and than said adam god woll send
us the oil of mercy when time of mercy is. And so adam and eve deed her
penance to her lives end and when adam had leued. ix. hundred year and.
xxx. and had.xxx. ^ones. and. xxx. doughteris they deyde and were both beried
to gedyr Adam and Eve.

Thus ye may se well that adam and eve were full holy or they dyed and
thought one death full inwardely and labored full besely and chastised her
flesche full resonably and so must we do that comythe of hem yt wolle come to
the joy of paradyse in tokenyng here of this sunday is called the sunday in
septuages^me a nombre of.lxx. The which nombre be gynnyth this day and en dyth
on estyr euyne so holy church is morning from this day till Escyr euyne than

Dominica.lx.
GOod men and wymmen this day is called the ^onday in sexagesime that is the
nombre of.lx. the which no^bre holy church techith every man and woman to
think how short once lyffe is now in our days for sum time people
leuyd.ix. ^ year and more and now three score or fore score is a long lyffe But
yet the grace of god and his mercy and goodness is so much that if we will do
our besynes and diligence to serve god and plese him he will give ^s as much
joy and bliss in heaven as he gaffe to ada^ and eve that leuyd so long but he
y^ will have that joy and bliss must do iij. things. One is he must hate
sin namely and suffer tribulacion mekely and do alms deed wylfully Than for
our days be short we must the more tribulacion suffer mekely and with
pacient heart and not grocchyng and dissese comyth of special grace for hit is
remedy for sins here in this world for penance or else for great encresyng
to his joy in a nothir world where for goddys apostell poul woll that all
christian people shall take ensample of him for he suffered much tribulacion
patiently that he rehersith in the pistell of this day And said thus. In
laborihus plurimia Poule seith I have be in many great trauelles and oftyn
times in prison sore bou^dyn with cheynes of yren Quinq virgis cesue.v. times
betyn with roddys and stourgis on my bare body with paynemes Semel lapida tus
And ones betyn with stones and three times in ship brekyng Nocte ac die in
profundum maria fui. And I was in the ground of the sea a night and a day Sepe
in periculis fluuium. many times in parell of flodes. Periculis latronu^ in
parell of theuys and in parell of false brethe re^ that showed true love to me
and were false and conseyled other to do me dissese and troubell. In fame et
siti. in hungre and thirst In ieiuniis multis. in much fasting In multis
vigiliis. in long wakyng In frigore. in cold and in many other myscheuys and
parell that were to long to tell and all he suffered with good will and ever
thankyd god of his sweet sonde for well he wyste that all these tribulacionus
and dissese was for sin that he had done to fore And to encresse his merit
and joy that should come after where for all christian people that woll plese
god what manner dissese or tribulacion that come to hem be hit sykenesse loss
of catell or other goodys or death of frendys take hit patiently and mekely and
thyn kyth hit comyth for sin that thou haste do to fore or else for great
encresse of joy and bliss that thou shalt have after for hit comyth of
special grace there as god visitith and comyth there as god sendith but there as
he sufferyth all her will is no good syne that he louythe. And there fore
thank god ever of his visitacion and beseke him ever of his mercy god knowithe
our entente. and there for he for yeuith sone to all that askyth mercy with a
meke heart Thus must a man suffer tribulacione patiently he must also do
alms discretly which be figured be these.lx. days for.lx. is sexesythis x.
so that by.vi. ye shull understand the vij. werkis of mercy that comen out of
the.x. comaundementes the why the be these to give mete and drink clothe her
borow visit p^soners conforte the sike blind lame and to berie hem that be
deed these be the. vij werkys of mercy the which all christian people must do
that woll be saved and have mercy of god wherefore sexagesime be gynnyth this
day and endith the wenesday in esterwe^ke the which holy church spekyth of
thus Denite benedicti pr^ia mei ^^. Come ye my fadres blessed children and take
the kingdom of heaven that is ordained for you These same wordys god shall sey
to you at the day of dome And to all that has done alms dedys diseretly and
full filled the werkys of mercy and they where of pore and tho that be not of
pore must do her good will and that shall fullfille the deed this must be do
discretly and how god techith this day i the gospel be ensample and seyth thus
Exiit qui semiuat seminare seme^ suu^ A man went to sow his sedis and as he
sewe sum fill by the wey and fowlys come and ete hem and sum fill among
thornys and was lost and su^me fill in good earth and brought forth an C. fold
encrese to this criste seythe thus him self Ego su^ via veritas et vita. I am
the verray right true lyffe and wey to heaven Thanne fallyth his sede be sydys
the wey that yeuith not his alms for cristis sake discretly but for pride
pomp and vain glory of the world and so lesith his mede And that I preue be
ensample.



There was in yrlond a wondyr rich man and deed much alms in his live in so
much that the people went he had be a saint But when he was deed he aperyd
to on that he loved well in his live as black as any pyche with an horrible
stynke and said ye wene that be a seynte but now y am soche as thou seiste.
than said he where be thy alms dedis and he said the wind of vain glory
has blowym hem a wey for he that does his alms for vain glory of the
world lesithe his mede and the ^endys of the air destroyit hit Also he
lesithe his mede that yeueth his alms to soche that knowith that bethe in
dedly sin and so to maynten hem in her syn his sede fallyth among stones and
wexyt dry and so lesithe his mede his sede fallith among thorns that yeuith
his good to rich people that have no need there to and so les^ her mede. But
his sede fallith in good earth that yeuith his alms to good true people for
they be goddis earth and that sede shall give an hundrid fold encrese in ever
lastyng joy and bliss and shall be ever lastyng fode to hem that does thus
her alms discretly. ye must also hate sin namely and fle hit in all that
ye may for he that hatythe and fleith sin loved god and god loved him for god
hatith sin in so much that he took vengeau^ ce one all the world for sin
of lechery and in special for the synn again kind for when god saw this sin
regnyng in all the world so vnwordely he feyd thus me forthyn kyth that ever I
made man and said to noye Fac tibi archam. make the a ship of planed bo^dys
as I shall teache the and make chambres there in and take of all clean bestis the
coupull be hem self and mete and drink with hem Than made Noye this ship
as god taught him square in the bottym and. iij. C. cubytus of length and.l.
cubytus in bread and.xxx. cubytus of heythe and this ship was in making an. C
winter to schewe how mercyable god is in taryyng to look if the people would a
mende hem. and how loathe he was to do vengaunce but the people was ever lengyr
the wors than be help of angellis all manner byr dys and bestys were browghte
to Noye and when all where brought to the ship our lord badde Noye and his
wyffe and his.iij. sons go in to the ship by hem self and Noyes wyffe and
her sons wyffes by hem self. for the men should not common with the wymen so
when they where all ynne god closyd the door to hem with out forth
Quodraginta diebus and quadragin ta noctibus aperti sunt celi Thanne hit reymd.
xl. days and. xl. nyghtes that the water bare the ship heyer tha^ any hill
be.xl. cubytus and stood still a.C. days and.xl. and drowned all the world
both people and best save those that were in the ship. yet Josephus said in
armany there is an hill and that is called Sarus that was heygher thanne the
water was And there for diverse people have opinione there was much people
saved so noye was in the ship all a year and then he put out a rauyn for
to bring word for to know if the water was cessyd or no and he come not ayene
Thanne he sent out a dove and sho come ayene and brought a branch of olyue
in her bylle and there by noye know well that the watyr was cesid in sum place
Thanne as god bad him Noye went out and took the unclean bestys from the
clean and burnt the unclean bestys in sacrifice to god And that plesyd god so
well that he yaffe hem and all that come of hem after leave to et^ flesche of
all clean bestys and for to drink wine there as be fore the flode the people
ete and drancke no think but watyr for the earth was so batyll in hit self to
fore that the people nedyd none other fode but soche as come of the earth Thus
may ye see and understand how great vengeance god took on all the world for
sin and now there is as much sin as ever there was in those days and much
more in many degrees where I dread left god will take vengeance on us And
would or this time where not the preyers of holy church and good seyntes And
in especial by the preyours of our lady and that ye shall here be ensample og
seint Do mymke as he was in his preyoures he saw our lord ihesu criste
holdyng three sperys in his hand ready to schete hem in to this world for
vengeance and all for sin Tha^ come our lady knelynge be fore our lord and
said my dear sone what woll ye done. And he said my dear modyr the world is so
full of sin of pride couetyse lechery and other sins that Iwoll schete
these.iij. sperys of vengeance on the people Thanne seyde our lady my dear
sone have mercy of hem and bide a while for I have sum true seruau^tis the
which shall preche and teache people to turn hem from sin And thus be preyour
of our lady god spared to take vengeance But now the world is so full of
sin and cursed leuyng of false extorcione and oppression of the pore people
that they cry to god for socour and help wherefore hit is full like that we
shall be smetyn full sone with some grievous vengeance other with derthe or
with skarnesse of pestilence wherefore hit is needful for us to prey besely to
our lady that she may prey for us to her dear sone our lord ihesu criste to
spare us in our days that we ^ow have grace and mercy now and ever Amen

GOod men and wymmen this day is called the sunday in quinquagesime this word
qumquagesime is a nombre of.l. the which nombre be tokenyth remissione and joy
for in the old law every l. winter all manner of people that where over set
with service of bondage. when they come to that age they were made free in
great joy and mirth to hem wherefore this no^bre begynnythe this day and endyth
on estyr day schewyng that all christian people that be oppressyd with any
tribulacion or dissese here in this world shall be made fre and have remission
at the day of dome and be made air in the kingdom of heuene And yet in
comfort of all christian people every.l. winter the pope of rome grau^tith full
remission of all sins to all christian people that comith to rome that year And
for all that may not come thedyr to have this pardon The pope of heuene ihesu
criste of his special grace grauntyth to all christian people full pardon of all
sins in her last end so that they woll keep three things here in this
world Confession contricion and satisfaction Holy shryfte of mowthe with
contricion of heart and satisfaction indede doing Also he must have charity
with out faynyng and stabyll faith with out flateryng and with out these there
may no man have pardon at rome nor else where and there fore he that woll be a
soylyd of the pope of heuene and have clean re^^ssyone he must be contrite
sorry for his sins and shryue him clean and be in full purpose never to sin
more And they that do thus god will for gyffe hem all their sins for a man
may have so great and soche contricion that hit may quench all the pains that
ever where ordained for him Take ensample by petyr y^ for soke crist thryes
with great othys but he was after contrite and sorry Et flenit amare. And wept
full bitterly and god that is full of mercy for yaue him his trespass and made
better chere to him after than he deed to fore for he should be in no dyspeyr
and dread.



we find of a great rich man that was so wicked in his live that much people
demyd him dampened to hell so he fille sike and felyd him self that be should
be deed. and he be thought him how wicked he had be in his leuyng and took
soche a contricion to him and so great sorrow that he wept night and day ever
wha^ his sin come to his mind and so lay.vij. days and.vij. nyghtes and
shroue him clean and took great repentance to him and ever cried god mercy so
that all people had great pite on him and than dyed Than hit happid that there
was a monk in an abbay that dyed the same time and was ma de by his abbothe to
come ayene to tell him how that he ferde and so he deed and said to the abbot
when he was come. Sir I am come to hepe my promysse I prey you give me leave to
go a gain for I go to joy Thanne said the abbot was there any moo that dyed
when thou dydyste that went to joy but you And he said ye for sothe on and no
mo and that was the soul of soche a man and told his na ne Thanne said the
abbot now y know well thou art not my monk but sum fend is come to te^pe
me for we know well if any soul be in pain he is one of tho. Than said the
monk full unworthy is any man to know the preuites of goddys dome. For that
man had so great contricion and repentance and wept so bitterly for his
synnys that the watyr of his eyes perysched through all his clothys to the
ground where for go thou the dyr to morrow and when thou fyndyste hit true that
I sey than leave me And I go to ever lastyng joy and bliss. Than went the
abbot the dyr and found that hit was true as the monk had said. and there
knelid the abbot down and thankyd god and badde all the people to be glad that
god is so merciful and that he had that knowleche. Here ye may se that great
contricion that this man had quenchyd the great pain that was ordained for
him. Thus ye may se how great help is to a mannys soul to be contrite and
sorry for his sins and to draw a man to the more contricion those.l. days
these psalm in the sauter Miserere mei dena Be more rehersyd these days than
any other time of the year the which is thus much to sey. God for thy great
mercy have mercy on me and when a man is sorry for his sins and seyth thus
with a sorrowful heart god he ryth his preyour and for yeuith him his trespase
so that he be in full purpose never to sin more but to a mende him and be in
parfeyte love and charity with out any faynyng and but he have chari^e with
out faynyng all this preualyth naught and be this ensamp^le.



There was a man that had.v. sons and had found hem long to scole and
cost him much good So on a day he called his.v. sons be fore him and said
children I have found you long to scole and have spend much good up on you
and I se no great profit there of. where fore but yewoll a monge you all a soil
me a question I woll do no more cost on you ne find you no lengyr to scole and
they asked of her fadyr what the question was and hit should be a soyled And he
said I am old and febyll and may not live long and there fore I would wete of
you what thing would bring a man's soul sonnest to heaven and anon the
eldyste son answered and said for sothe fadyr prechyng and techyng woll bring
a soul sonneste to heaven of any thing. well said quoth the fadyr what seiste thou
to the second sone And he answered and said faith and true be leave bryngithe
a soul as sone to heaven. what seyste thou to the question my thryde sone and
he said good preyours and alms deed bryngith a soul sone to heaven what
seyste thou to the matter fowrith sone and he seyde pylgyymage going and great
penance sufferyng bryngith a soul sonner to heuene than any of all these what
seyste thou my fyuith sone and he said for sothe fadir there is anothir thing
that bryngith a soul sonner to heaven than all these what is that seyde the
fadyr for sothe fadir said he charity for what virtue that ever a man have and
he lack charity it vaylith not to heaven wardys for though a man prey and do
alms dedis goo a pilgrimage have full faith and be leave teache and p^che fast
and suffer penance never so much cry and wype never so loud and he be out
of charity god herith him not And here to acordyth seint poule in his pistel
and seythe thus Si linguia hominu^ loquar ^^. Though y were so eloquente as
any man or any angel. Et si babuero propheciam et omne scienciam And though y
had all the co^nyng in the world and know the propheci and the preuite of god
Omnem fidem vt montea tra^sferam And though y had so much faith that y
might meue hills. Et si distribuero in cibos pauperu^ And though y delyd all
my good to pore people for goddis sake Corpua meum vt ardea^ And my body to
brenne in hot fire. Caritatem autem non habe^m nichil michi prodest. if y have
not charity all this prefetith not to heuene wardys where fore hit is needful
and most necessary to every creareis soul that woll be saved to have charity
but though a man seyth that he loves god and loves not his even christian he
is disceyued For he that loved god loves his neighbor in good entente.

Thus must a man have full charity that will be saved Caritas cooperit
multitudine^ peccatorum. For charity coueryth the multitudo of sins. For he
that dies in dedely sin and out of charity shall be dampened And therefore of
all virtues charity is most vertuus and most necessary to a man's soul. yet
we must have a stable feythe with out flateryng and to believe saddely as
holy church techith. and to believe feythfully in the fadyr sone and holy ghost. the fadyr full god the sone full god and the holy ghost full and these
three persons be but one god that made all thing of naught. This faith was
first shewde in the holy patryarche in the vale of mambre there he saw three
fair men coming toward him but he worshipped but one yeuyng ensample to all
christian people to se in spirit the fadir the sone and the holy ghost three
persons in one god head and worshipped hem as on god Also ye must believe in
the carnacion of our lord ihesu criste that our lady conceived in the holy ghost with outewemme of her body in flesche and blood as one of us and verry
god and man and was deed and beried Tercia die resurrex it a mortuia And one
the thryde day he rose from death to lyffe Ascendit ad celos. And styed up to
heaven on holy thoursday. In de venturus est iudicare viuos and mortuos and
shall come a yene at the day of dome and deem the quick and the deed This is
^iguryd by isaac the sone of abraham that he get one his wyffe Sara thourgh
the holy ghost when they both where passyd age to bring forth. for god
seyde to abraham yt he should have fruit as great in multitude as there were
sterrys in the firma meant Than when this child was borne he was called isaac
And when he was.xxv. winter of age god seyde to abraham in this wise. Take thy
sone isaac and go to soche an hill as he showed to him and offer him in
sacrifice that was to sle him as the manner was sum time. Than abraham had be
hefte of god to have great issew and though he loved his so ne never so much
yet he took him anon with out grocchyng and went to the hill and made his
sone isaac to bear wode to brenne him self with And when they come to the hill
top abrah^ made an auter of wode and set hit on fire and than he took his
sone isaac and would have slain him and offered to god. Than anon spoke an
angel to abraham and bade him leave of and take the sheep that stood there by
and offer him instead of thy sone isaac. He abraham ye may understand the
^adyr of heaven and be isa ac his sone ihesu criste yt spared for no love that
he had to him but suffered the iewis to ley woe de upon his back that was the
cross y^ he should be done on him self and ladde him to the hill of caluary
and there deed him upon the Auter of wode that was the cross that was made of
^owre diverse manner of wode that was Cidyr Cipir Olyue and Palm and there on he
dyed for all man kind Thus may criste well be called isaac that is understand
laughter for many a soul he brought out of hell laugyng that went the thyr
sore weeping. Than like as this was a figure of cristys pession long or he was
borne right so this day criste him self in the gospel seyde thus to his
disciples that he should be betrayed. Tradetur enim genti^ua et il ludetur et
flagella bitur and conspuitur et post^uam flagel lauerunt eum and die tercia
resurget.

And how he should be takyn and betyn with stourges spytte upon and after his
stourgyng done upon the cross and so sle him and the thride day shall rise
again to life and for they should have the better believe there to and to his
wordys anon to fore hem he made a blind man to see that cried and seyde.
Ihesu fili david miserere me^ Ihesu the son of david have mercy of me. Thanne
said our lord to him what woldeste thou that I should do to the and he said
^omine vt videam lord give me sight. Thanne said our lord thy seythe has
saved the And a none he had his sight and he thankyd god So must every
criston man that will have perdon^ of god he mote have contricion full of heart
with shrifte of mouth and sa tisfaction in deed being in hole charity with
out faynyng and in stable feythe with out flateryng And to stere you more to
the feythe I tell you this ensample.



There was a bishop in england that hyghte croste head and was bishop of
lyncoll and was holdyn the grettyst clerk in england or in the world and when
he lay in his death bed there come to him a great multitude of fendes and
disputedr with him of the feythe in so much that they had de nyghe turned him
out of the believe and put in to despair.

Thanne was our lady ready and said to him my servant be leuyste thou not in
holy church as it techith And anon he cried and said yis gracious lady I be
leave as holy church techith me. and anon the fend is went her wey and gafe
up the ghost to ever lastyng bliss to the which god bring us all Amen.

^ominica prima quadragesime.
^Ood men and wymmen this day is called in holy church the first sunday in
quadragesime a nombre of.xl. for from this day till es^y^ day be.xl. days and
for be cause that every man synnyth more or less for to make satisfaction for
our trespass all christian people be bound be the l^we of god and holy church
to fast these.xl. days save tho that the law dispensith with for reasonable
cause Children that be with in age wymm^n that be with child. old people that
be might lose to fast laboryng people as pylgremys and syke people those the
law dispensith with upon her concience. Than for the cause that sunday is no
day of pena^nce there for ye shall be gynne your fast one esche wedenysday
that day ye most come to holy church and ^^ ke aschys of the prestes hands
and thenke one the words* well that he seytth oner your hedys. Memento ho^
quod cinis es et in cinerem reuerteris. have mind man of aschys that thou art

ye shall fast these xl. days on is as the gospel tellith this day thus.
^nct^s est I^es^a in desertu^ ^t temptaretur a diabolo how the holy ghost bade
our lord cris^ jhesu go in to deserte to win iherusa lem and iherico to be
te^ ^^ed of the fend and was there xl. days fasting and xl. nyghtis for your
sake showing to all christian people the ^ertu and the ^^de that comythe of
fasting the which ^e express^d in the preface of the mass that is said in
holy church the xl. days that is thus Qui corporal^ i^i^^io vi cia comprimis
men tem ^le^^^ virtutem largiria That holy fasting th^usteth down ^ices and
lifts up thouthe of man to ^ t^ous and to largeness of all goodness and
getith great m^de in heaven that shall last ever and ^^^^ gra^e ^ere in earth
for as clerks tell the spetell of a sastyng man shall sle an addyr bodily
than much more it sleithe the might of the old addir that is the fend of
hell that come to eve in para dyse in likeness of an ad dyr and temptid her
to glotony vein glory and couetyse right so the ^^nde come to criste in
likeness of a m^ left ^e had be knowyn and temptid criste and as the gospel
seythe C^m i^i^^asset quadragint^ di^^^a et quadraginta no^ti^^^ poste^ esuxiit
when criste had de fastyd xl. days and xl. nyghtis than be kind of manhood
he hunge red Than come the fend to him and schewde him stones and seyde. Si
^i^i^^ dei ^a ^i^ vt ^apides isti pac^ fiant. if thou be goddis sone of heaven
make these stones bread for right as ^^^ was ^^beshed when she saw the appyll
be temptacion of the fend to ete there of The same wise he went to hate made
crist to ete of the bread For glotony is not only in man's mete but in the
foul lust and appetite of a man. Than seyde criste anon to him Non in solo
pane vi uit homo sed de omni verbo quod procedit de ore dei Man leuythe not
only by bread but by every word that comythe from the mow the of god Than the
fend took him and set him upon the high pynnacle of the temple and seyde if
thou be gods sone bring the self down with out man's h^lpe or harm that I
may know the for goddys sone than seyde our lord Non temptabis dominu^deum
tuum. Thou shall not tempte thy lord god* yet he come a yene the thrydde time.
Assumysit eum diabo lus in montem excelsum et ostenditei omnia regna mu^di. He
took him and set him one an high hill and shewde him all the kygdomes and
richesse of the world and seyde thus to him Her omnia tibi dabo si cadens
ador^ueri^ me All this I shall give the if thou wolte fall down and worship
me. Thanne seyde our lord god onto him

Dade sathanas scriptum est euim dominum deum tuum adorabis et illi soli
seruies. Go sathanas hit is wreton thou shalt worship thy lord god and only
him serve tha^ he left him and went his wey Angeli acces serunt ad ibesum and
ministraba^t ei.

Thanne angelis come and brought him fode for the fend is most besy these xl.
days to te^pte people to three sins to p^ryde couetyse and glotoni it is
needful to have three remedies a yense hem. that is a yenste glotony
abstinence. a yense pride meekness. and a yenste couetyse largmes. a yense
glotony we must fast that is not to ete before time and at mete not to ete
gretely no more tha^ a nothir time and to fast both day and night as criste
did but there is much people woll sit and drink both night and day and so
fill her bodies with foul lust of glotony Also ye must fast from all manner
of flesche mete and white mete For Jeromie seith eggys is all most flesche and
milk blood and wha^ ye go to your mete take ensample be holy church when
the priste goth to mass that is goddys word how he at his beginning bowith
down his knees and byddyth all other do the same in the ^^yddys of the masse^
and at the end of the mass bow down yo^re he dys to god and therefore when
ye go to your mete so worship god with a Pater noster and an Aue that sent
you that fode and than make a cross upon your mete and after mete a nothir and
thank god hyghly that send you that fode at your need to your bodily
sustinaunce. thus must ye fast against glotony A yenste pride that is but a
feign glory of the world ye must put a way all soche thoughtys of pride and
highenesse in heart and be meke and lowly in heart and think how a man is
borne febyll sike and full pore and how he gothe every day a journey toward his
death while he leuythe in this world and at the last comythe death and cast
him down in to his bed and lie there Sykyng and grownyng and chaundid both
hyde and hew Thanne stynkyth his brethe and his lyppys wexit black his face
pale and his eyes yelowe his tongue eugleymed and his nose black his tothe
fallyn a wey his flesche wederith and tournythe to earth And thanne at the
last with great sighyng yeuith up the ghost and thanne lythe there as earth
and put in to the earth Cito obliuisceris And so shall be s^ne for gotyn.
There for take this sadly in your mind and I hope ye shall put awey pride.
Thanne a yense couetyse ye must have Abstynaunce that is for to sey ye must
absteyne your self from wordely couetyse and vanytees and they that have be
hard in keeping of goodys. and ever have gaderithe to gedyr to and fast have
in keep But now shul de ye be as ready to pay and content that ye be in debt
un to both to god and to the world And also to restore again that he has
takyn wrongfully. and give to pore people mete and drink and clothys and other
things such as is needful and to hem. And the fete that have all this this
year gone besely to get goodys of the world now must ye be as so be sy to go
and give the pore people to them that have need as we have in the gospel Date
et da bitur ^obi^. give ye and god will give you for the hondys that woll not
give none Alms they be full unworthy to be acceptable un to god

Also ye must go full besely un to goddys service and in pilgremages going and
to all manner good dedys of Alms and he that has be b^sy to gedyr good n^w
should he spare from his own m^^she for to give the pore nedy that is goddys
people for that plesith god much and gretely helpyth the soul Elemosina a
morte liberat Alms delyuerith the soul from death Sicut aqua extinguit ignem
ita eleo^sina extinguit peccatum For right as water quenchith fire right so
alms deed quenchith synue where for the prophet seythe thus Date et d^bitur
vobis give ye and god will give you Dimittite et dimittemini For give and god
will for give you But now all is little y noughe to feed your bodies that
nothing ye may give to pore bodies for goddys sake



we read that there was a worthy knight and rich man of goodys and a mighty
man of his ho^ des but he cherishyd much his body with delicate metys and
deyntys but at the last he dyed and was beryed in a to^ be of stone than had
he a sone that was a worthy man and vsid every day in custume to sey
deprofundis for his fadres soul be his tomb so one a day he made a great
feste to all the worthy astatis in the country a boute him when they should
wesche and go to mete this man be thought him how he had not said
Deprofundis and preyde the people to a bide till he had seyde his deuocions
and they said they would go with him and deed so Thanne there fill soche a
lust in this man's heart that he must nedys see his fadres tomb opened or
else him thought he should dye. And so made the people to opyn the to^be tha^
a none was he ware of a great black tode also black as any py^che with eyes
bernyng like fire that had be clyppyd his fadres heart with her foul clowys
and gnewe fast there one Thanne seyde this man O fadyr much good mete and
drink has go down that th^o the and now thou art stra^ gelyd with a foul
hell hounde and horrible foul best. And a none he lat goo close the tomb a
yene and so yede to mete And when he had served all the people preuely he went
forth and left child and lordshippe and all his goodys and went to ^he
rusale^ and leuyd there a mo^g beggeris with other pore people in great pouerte
all his lyffe and so did when god would and went to ever lastyng joy as I
hope to the which joy god bring us all to Amen.

Dm^ca secu^da qua dragesime
GOod men and wymmen it is i^ the second son day in clean lent where for like
as ye have all this year made you honest in good a ray to your body Now should
ye be as sone^besy to make you a clean soul where for this time of lent is
ordained to cleanse your concience from all manner ruste and filthe of sin so
that ye may on Estyr day with clean co^cience receive. the body of our lord
^h^^u criste where fore s^int poule in the pystell of this day seythe thus. He
e^ voluntas dei. This is goddys will that ye should be besy and holy to keep
your bodies in clennesse for to plese god much and to prey to him to make his
vessel clean a yense the coming of our lord the su criste. than shall ye
understand that this vessel is man's co^ cience and that is a good vessel
y^ kepith all good thyngis that is put there in till the day of dome. for at
that day of dome every man's ^essell shall be opened and the world shall see
what a man has kept there in be it better or worse fair or foul. Than he
that bryngithe a clean vessel be fore the high judge shall be well a lowed.
Thanne how a man shall keep his vessel clean holy church tech ith by a
ensample of an holy batriarke Jacob that is read and song of all this woke
jacob had a fadyr that was callid Isaac and his modyr rebecca And she had ij.
children at on birthe and that was first borne hyghte esau and that other
Jacob But for the story is long we shall take at this time that is most
needful and leave that other Thanne had god give his patriarch ^saac soch grace
that what blessyng he gave his blessid children they should have it Than for
Isaac was old and blind and nyghe his death he said to his sof^e Esau Aufer
michi de venatione tua Go and hunte and get me sum mete that I might ete of
Been dica^ tibi pri^squa^ moriar That I may give the my blessyng or I dye But
when Esau was gone jacob that younger be techyng of his mo dyr gate his fadres
blessyng and his fadyr said to him Esto du^^^ra trum tuoru^ Be thou lord of
all thy brethren And so made him his Air and blessid all that blessid him.
Than wha^ Esau was come home and wyste this he hatid Jacob his brothyr and
thought to ^le him Thanne jacob be counsel of his modyr went out of the
country un to au uncle that he had that highte laban. And as he went be the
wey in a country of wild people leuyng he durst not ^^ ge with hem^ a bide but
^ay all a nyte in the field by the wey and leyde a stone under his head and
slepte Diditqg iu so^p nis scalam stante^ super terram And in this sleep him
thought he saw a ladder that stood on the earth and la styd up to heaven and
god joined to the ladder An gelos quoque dei ascendentes et desce^ dentes And
angeles of god going up and down. Thanne god spoke to him and said I am god of
abraham and ^saac and I woll give the this land and be thy keeper in thy wey
Than woke jacob and said. Dear dn^a est in loco isto et e^o nescie bam For
sothe god is this place and I wyste not And so went forth to his uncle and was
with him xx. winter and more his servant and wed did his ij. doughteris that
one highte rachell and that other ly^ And wha^ he had de be there so long he
desiryd home ayene in to his own country and took with him his wy^^e and his
children and all his catell and went forth Thanne come there to him multitude
of angeles to help him Than wha^ jacob come to a ford he made all his meyny to
go be fore with his Catell and him self ^ode be hynde in his preyours and as
he preyde there come an an angel to him in likeness of a man and wrastelid
with him all the night till on the morrow and took him by the great senowe of
his thyghe and made him to halte ever after. Tha^ said the angel to jacob what
is thy name he seid jacob Nay said he thou shalt no longer highte jacob but
israhel shall be thy name. and blessed him and left him there haltyng and thus
he went home to his own country with great prosperity. This story is read in
holy church in this ensample to all good seruau^tis that desirith to get the
blessing of the fadyr of heaven and to have heritage that is there he must
first be jacob and after israhel. For jacob is to understand a wrasteler and
israhel a man that seyghte god for he that will see god he must wrastell here
in earth with the bad angel that is the fend and with his own flesche as
thus when he has done a great hor^ible sin than the ^ende puttyth to him
a great shame in heart so that he dare not tell hit out. Thanne must he
weastell with the find and the flesche and over come and tell out his sin
opynly with all the circumstaunce of his syn Thanne woll his flesch be a ferde
and a shamed there of but than he must wrastell with his flesche strongely and
make hit to tell his sins and to do penance aftyr the counsel of his
goos^ely fadyr taking the ensampell of the woman of ^er country that come to
criste as the gospel seith Ecce mulier cananea a finibua illis egressa
clamauit dicens How the woman of cananee come to crist to get hele for her
daughter that was trobbled with a fend And said Ihesu fili david mi serere mei
ihesu the sone of david have mercy on me Thanne our lord answered No^ est
^o^^m sumere panem filinrum and dare canib^^ Hit is not good to take bread of
children and give hit hundys Nam et catelli ^^e ^t de mensa di^ro rum suorum
yis lord for why when l^es eten of the c^ommys that fallyn from her lordys
board. Thanne said our lord Mulier magna est fides tua fiat tibi sicut via. O
woman thou haste a great feythe where for as thou wolte thy daughter be saved
and so was her daughter hole. This woman and her daughter be tokenythe a man
that his concience trauelythe with a fyude of dedely sin that may not be
helped but he go to god and there shryne him to the priste sparyng for no
rebuke nor shame ne for dread but me kely suffer all that the co^fessor seythe
to him and take his penance mekely with a contrite heart and do hit with good
devotion and so he shall be de lyueryd of the fend that has trouelyd his
concience. For a man that has done an horribell sin and shall be saved he
shall never have rest in his concience till he be shryuen there of for right ^^
an hounde gnawith a bone that is hard right so his sin gnawith his concience
showing be experience how houndys of hell shall gnawe his soul ever more with
out rest that dies wetingly in dedely sin that he might have be shryue^ of
and would not Ensample of a woman.



There was a woman that had done an horrible sin and would feign have be
shreuyn there of and durst not. Tha^ come our lord to her bodily and said my
daughter why shryuest thou the not of thy sin lord y may not for shame.

Thanne seyde onre lord take me thyn hand and put her hand in to his side
even to his heart and seyde woman what felis^ thou and she quakyd for fere and
said lord y feel thine heart. thanne seyde our lord be thou no more a shamed
to show me thyn heart tha^y to let the feel mine than this woman rose and
with light saw her hand all blody and would have waschyd hit of bnt it would
not till on the moxow that she was shrenen and than was her hand clean as hit
was be fore and she clean of all her sins and thus she was made clean both
body and so ule.

shall not excuse yodo at the day of dome for as soon as ye have offendyd god in
many trespacis that hurtith the soul anon ye should make you clean and will
it never in your mind but ye woll not come till hit be for gotyn And so yet
wha^ ye come to shryf te ye be dome for the fend is withyn you for ye wene
many times that hit be no sin to speak an ydyll word to make the people to
laughe nor to swear a great oath it does no harm but seint poule in his
pistell forbedith every man to speak any idyll wordis and seithe thus. Dico
autem vobis quod omne verbum ociosum quod locuti fuerint omnea reddent rationea
in die iudicii For sothe. I sey to you that ye shall give a rekenyng for every
idyll word that ye speak and non shall pass un punyshid at the day of dome.
and there for late all idyll wordis be harlatry and rybawdiy And if ye so do
that is worship to god and profit to the speker for there as harlatry is
much spokyn it is much in mind For the tongue shewde the habundau^ce of the
heart so first in thought after in his spekyng hit causith much people to
fall in sin of deed doing. Dnus quisque temptatur concupiscencia. Furste
every man is temtid to sin be lust of thought there one. Concupisce^cia
generat pccm^. And the lust gaderith sin. Peccatnm cu^ consummatum fuerit
generat morte^. And when the sin is done hit causithe dam pnacione ever
lastyng death that is in spekyng rebawdry and harlatry for the lust that a man
has in spekyng is great sin.



we find of an abbas that was a clean woman as for any deed of sin but she
had great lust to speak there of So when she was deed and beried in the
church the night after come fendys and took up the body and all to beat hit
with brennyng scourges fro the nauyll upward that it was as black as any
piche But fro nauyll downward it shone as bryghte as any son and the fendes
might do it no harm and ever as the fendes beat her she cried pitously that
ij. of her sustres that where sextens were sore a ferde there of but either
comfortid other so that they went nere till they wist how it was Than spoke
the sperite to her suste ren and seyde ye know well that I was a clean meyden
as for any deed. but I had great lust to speak of synn that party has
great pain as ye may se where for i prey you susteren prey for me for by your
preyouresy may be helped. and be ware by me in time coming here by ye may se
what parell it is to speak idyll wordis and harlatry speech. where for this
same pistell seythe thus Abstinetis vos a fornicatione. Absteyne you from
fornicacion and all sins and walkithe with criste in love and pees as criste
deed that suffered for us many scorns rebukes and dispites and all he took
mekely patiently and in charity yeuyng ensample to all christian people to do the
same* but he that woll leave in rest and pees shall have great persecucion of
evil people but and he suffer hit mekely he is a martyr be fore god and in
confermyng of this holy church makythe mind and mention as thus.

we read of an holy man that was callid Joseph that suffered great persecucion
but he suffered ^it mekely there for god brost ghte him to great worshipp^ and
prosperity. and how ye shall here but for this story is long there for we shall
take that is most needful at this time. This Joseph had a fadir that highte
jacob and had xij. sons brothe ren to joseph but his fadir louid him most
specially of all that other and there for his brethren hatid him the more And
in especial for a dreme y^ he dremyd where by they supposid all that he shul
de be lord of hem all. and all they should do him worshipp^ and a non they
took her counsel to gedyr and seyde Venite itamque occidamus illum Let us go
there for and sle him but yet they durst not for dread of god and a non
Vendiderunt eum in egipto they sold him in to egipte to a man for.xxx. pennys
as god was sold and there for god was with him So a man that was steward to
the king bought him that hight po^tifer but the fend had great envy to Joseph
^ temptid the lady sore on him. Post multos itaque dies iniecit domina oculos
in joseph et ait veni dormi mecum So on a day the lady lokid on joseph and took
him by the mantill and seide come and sleep with me and as soon as Joseph under
stood her menyng anon he yode and flede his wey and left his mantill there Than
this woman cryde and told her husbonde how Joseph would have leyne by her and
for he should not sey nay she kept his mantill. There for the lord made to
cast joseph in prison there as pharao had put his boteler and his baker and as
they fell a sleep they dremed the which dremes they told Joseph and he seide
that the king would restore his boteler to his office ayene with in three days
and the Baker should be hanged with in three days and as he seyde hit was than
happyd so that the king dremed him self but there could no men tell what
should fall there of but be counsel of the boteler the king sent after joseph
And when the king had told him his dreme Joseph seyde that god hade sent him
a fair warnyng to puruey him to fore that should come aftyr And he said there
should come vij. plenteuous yeris of corn and of all manner fruits and vitayles
and aftyr hem should come vij. yeris in the which people should spend all
that was go tyn to fore. Thanne the king seyde I know no man that cowde puruey
so well for soche a thing as thou coudist wherfo^ I make the gretttest under me
of all my ^eame and ^ shall do to the as to me at thy commandment Thanne a
none io seph let make the gretest bernes that ever was seyne and gaderid corn
fast vij. yeris And sone after come vij. yeris that all things was scarche
and dear. Than jacob Joseph fadyr herd that there was corn to selle in
egipte. And he sent the their his x. sons for to bey corn and when they come
thethir and saw Joseph all fill down on her knees and did him worship like
as his dreme was for they know not him but went that he had belord of the
country. But he know hem well y now. Thanne he spoke to hem in lateyne. Surge
And said they where spies that where come to know of the lon de. and they
seyde nay they where all brethren and all oue man's sons and a nothir
brother they had that was at home with her fa^yr and there was a nothyr and
they woste not where y^ he were a live or no and that they mente by Joseph and
for to preue the trowthe he made to bind on of hem that highte Symeon and
seyde that he should a bide with him tili they hade fette him at home. and so
let fill her sackys with corn and preuely put her money in to her sackys
vnwetyng to hem. And so when they come home to her fadyr and put out her corn
there they for de her money and they told her fadyr but than was he sorry for
symeon his sone that was left be hynde in prison And more over for that he
must ^edys send fore him which he loved most and that was beni^min Joseph
hole brothir for these other where but half brethren to Joseph But when jacob
faylyd corn he must nedys send for more and he sent forth Benjamin And
when Joseph saw his brothyr benjamin he might not for bear weping and anon
delivered him his brothyr symeon and set hem all to mete and fillyd her
sackys with corn and preuely put the cup that they drank of in beniamyns
sack and he ^ad hem go her wey But anon aftyr joseph seute aftyr hem and
seyde they where to blame while they had so good chere to bear a wey the
cup that they drank of Thanne they were heavy and sad and said hit was not
so and he ran sakyd hem by and by and than they fond hit in Beniamyns sack
tha^ come they ayene to joseph sore weeping and when joseph saw hem all weep
and his own brothyr Benjamin made most sorrow for it was found with Thanne
^oseph badde hem all be of good chere for I am joseph your brothyr and be no
thing a dread for god has sent you hedyr for your profit and a none sent
aftyr his fayir and so dwelled all to gedir a great while in that land with
much prosperity This story is rad de this weke in holy church for goddys
childeren should take ensample of old fadres to suffer tribulacion and
persecncion mekely in parfyte charity for goddys sake as he suffered for us.
for who that gro^hith a yense tribulacion and persecucion that god sendith
must shryue him and take his penance. for there is sum people will sey why
does god thus by me what have I trespa sid a gain him tho be in great parell
for her patience for truly wordys may let much grace.



we find in miracles de wynfryde the virgyne that a man come to her on a
night upon ij. c^ochys full of many manner sikenesse, And so be the help of
god and this holy virgin this man was hole and so went where he would hol^
all day in the abbey and tha^kyd highely god and this holy virgin of his hele
So at night he went to his bed in good hele and on the morrow his sikenesse
took a yene sarrur than hit deed be fort and so lay cryyng that hit was great
pi^e to here

Thanne come a monk to him and asked him what he hade done that his sikenesse
was come a yene and he said no thing Thann seyde the monk were thou shreuyn
sethe thou were hole and he seyde nay I had no need for I stale nethyr ox
nor cow nor did no grievous sin than the monk thought though a ^a^ do no
dedly synue he may do so many vema^^ that they may make a dedely sin for
right as a man may with many small cornys charge a scronge horse so may he let
his soul with so many small sins that he may fall in to the pit of hell
Thanne a none this man went to a priste and shwue and so was hole both in body
and soul ever aftyr be confession and preyoures of this holy virgin Amen

Dm^ca ^narta quadragesime
GOod men and wym men this is the fourth sunday in lenton the which holy church makythe mention of an holy prophet that was callid moyse the which
was a figure of our lord jhesu criste many yeris or our lord was borne Tha^
as we read in holy church as moses was in the deserte of synay god spoke to
him and said Didi afflicto^n^ populi mei qui est in egipto clamorem eius ^^dini
etc^. Pharao the king of egipte oppressithe so the people of israhel with
bondage and unreasonable werkys and they for woo cryde to me for socour and
help where for go thou thethir and bring hem out of her bondage and I shall be
with the then bring hem and offer hem to mey woll bring hem into a land of
plenteuousnes of all goodys So wha^ he had taught moses how he should do
moses went thedyr and gederid all she old people to gedir that know the
prophecy how they should be ladde out of that land and said to hem as god bad
him tha^ were they full glad and went with him old and young till they come to
the reed see and god was ever before hem in the day in a pilar as a cloud to
refresche hem from the hets of the son and in the night in a pilar snyur to
light fro harm of venym bestis. But when that pharao herd that moses had
forth this people he took.iij. C. chariotis of his own and iij. C. of the
land and lx. M. horsemen and iij. C. M. fotemen and went aftyr

And when moses saw this people come he preyde to god for help and god him
self smyght the sea with his yerde. Et percussit mari rubro And when he had
smetyn the sea he had wey for him and his people the sea clefe a ij. parties
so that the watyr stood still on every side as an hill and the ground was dry
sonde. Than moses yede forth and all the people aftyr him

Than wend pharao to have passyd also and sewyd aftyr with all his oste but
when he had his oste with in the se the watyr went to gedyr and drowned him
and all his oste and when moses saw that he and his people were thus peryshyd
he thankyd god and was there vij. days aftyr and every day they yede to the sea thankyng god of her passage making great melody that our lord hade do so
to hem. And yet mind here of all Estyr weke we make solemn procession to the
font y^ is the reed see Thanne went moses forth with his people in to
deserte till he come to the hill of Synay and there he left the people be
nethe Stabat moisea super montem and moses stood up on the hill there as god
was And there he was fourthy days and fourthy nyghtis with out mete or drink
Thanne god gafe him ij. tabeles of stone in the which god wrote with his own
fynheris the x. commaundementis and took them moses and bad him teache hem ^o
his people And when moses come down to the people his face was all bryghte
as the son and ij spyris stondyng on his head like ij horns so that the
people might not speak with him for clerenesse Abscondit moisea faciem s^am.

Thanne moses hid his face with a kerchoffe Thanne in that on leffe were
wreton the three co^maundementis that langithe to god. and that be these. The
first is thou shalt worship thy god and love him a boue all thing for thou
shall te direct all mauer thing to goddys will be ^^^ thy ne own and shwe his
will and not thy own will The secounde commandment is this.

Thou shalt not take his name in vein. that is for to sey thou shalt not be
callid goddis child as a christian man and serve the send fore than that name
is to the but vain. Also thou shalt not swear by god nor by no part of his
body no^ by no thing that he made but in foetheryng of the truth And yet but
when thou art constreyned there to. The thrydde commandment is thou shalt
keep thy holy day that is for to sey thou shalt be erly up and late down to
serve god on the holy day as thou art on the work day to thy own work as
besy shalt thou be on the holy day to serve god The fourth commandment is
thou shalt worship thy fadyr and thy modyr that brought the in to this would
Also thy godfadyr and thy godmodyr that made the a christian man and thy fadyr
vndyr god that has cure and charge of thy soul The v. is thou shalt sle no
man no this with thy tongue nor with thy hand nor with evil ensample The vi.
thou shalt not stele no man's god (...)

fere of the common people for they hylde him a prophet But this day they knette
hem to gedyr and fully a cordyd that they would spare for no thing but he
should be deed where for as the gospel tellith as criste prechid in the temple
the jews rebukyd him spetuously and seyde N^^^ cognonimus quia demo^i^m habes
Now know we that thou haste a fend with the and all was to tempte him to have
made him speak su^^^e evil word be the which they might have put him to
sum repreue and for he told hem that he was goddis sone they were ready to
have stoned him to death but he know all her malice. Jhesus autem abscondit se
et exiuit de templo Ihu^s hid him self and went out of the temple.

Thus our lord this day began his passione where for holy church redithe
this weke in the book of jeromie the prophet that first prophesied of cristus
passione and told how and in what manner the jews should done him to death
Tha^ye shall understand well that in the same wise as the jews pursued criste
to the death in the same wise I fere greatly left there be much false people
that been christian that pursewith criste in heaven now. Saint Austeyn seyth that
they sin more grievously that pursew him in heaven than the jews did that
pursewid him here in earth to death. Than if ye woll wete which these be. take heed how criste markyd hem and seyde thus.

Qui ex deo est verba dei audit He that is of god herith the word of god for
he herith not the word of god that swery the many great othis full falsely these
ben tho that pursewid him in henen that been glad in her hertys when they have
a foul deed do and be groundid in foul cursid leuyng of syn and woll not a
mende hem for prechyng nor techyng but ever do foul dedys and a none be ready
to fight and to chyde with hem that tell ithe hem her defawtis as hit is
shewde by criste For the mo har me is. the conditions of the people is such
now a days that he shall have many enemies that will sey truth and that I
may preue by ensample



There was sum time a mawment in a cite that would tell where anythyng was
that was stole or myssyd and how had hit. So hit happid on a time that a young
man had stole a thing and was a ferde of this mawmetis and a none he went to
this mawme^t and seyde thus well I wot thou may do me a great shame and
vyllony but be god that y believe upon and thou discover me I woll break thy
head and so went for the his wey Thanne so ne aftyr come they that myssyd this
good preyng the mawment to tell hem how had hit and when they had long
preyde at the last the maument spoke and said times be ^hau^gid the people be
worse thanne they were who seythe the troughte his head shall be broken. So he
that woll sey truth he shall be shente and so the true man shall be so huntyd
and so pluc hyd that he shall not we te to whom he shall speak nor to whom he
may tell his council in trust for he that woll sonest disceyue him wolle
speak sum time most fay rest so that may be p^uyd Hit is wreton in the book
of kings how there were ij. knyghtis great enmyes on to that othyr y^ one
highte Jacob and that other amasa and this jacob seyde to Amasa as they met
hayle brothyr and kyssid him and with his other houde be hynde he slew him
with his knyfe and smote him to the heart. Thus hit farithe now a days be mo
the people they speak full fair be fore the people and be hynde him they woll
^le him with a shrowde knyffe that is with the cursid tongue these be they that
pursewed him in heaven and set naught by goddys word for if though they
heren hit with her erys hit synkith naught in her hertis.

where god pleynith him grievously be his prophet Ieremye. and seyde thus what
gylte found your fadres in me if I have trespasid to you in any manner thing
tell me Alas for shame of our obstynat pride for god is in the right and so
he tretith with us that be in the wrong he proferith mercy or we ask hit he
makithe him merciful to hem that displesuhe him. and shewde love there ^one is
worthy.

Thus be her hertis herder than any stone and thus we be worcester than jews thus we
be un kind to him that shewde to us all kyndenesse and ever he cries to us
and feythe I have left on earth for ye should here my scripture. Torn again to
me and i woll receive the lo my armies be all ready spradde to clipp^e the to me
and my head is ready bowed to kiss the my sidys are ready, to show thy mine
heart myu hondes mine fete bledon to show the what I suffered for the and thou
turnest away fro me. and thou be in perfect lyff I wolle give the tresonre with
out no^bre I shall a vaunce the with out comparisone and give the rest with
ou^tyn end so that all the fawte shall be found in the and not in me Thus
our lord proferith and techith us and there be full few that will here him but
let all these wordys pass out of her hertys an^ ^^ke no head but all her
^^yndes in richesse and this worldis prosperity in this present lyffe and take
full ^itill head of the lyffe that is coming. and our lord jhesu crist
suffered death to bring us to ever lasting bliss.

There for in cristus person makithe the prophet a great lamentacion for the
great vnkynddenesse that he seethe in mankind and seythe thus.

Thou man for vanite thou stinkyste for thy rusty sin and there for j cry
and weep for thou haste on thy head a garlonde of flowers and j for the have
one of thorns thou haste on thy ho^des a ^eyre of white glouys and j for thy
have many blody wounds

Thou haste in thine arms spradde to lead karrollis and daunces and mine arms
for the be nay led on a tree with sharp naylus. Thou haste thy clothis pynched
small and my body for the is full of great walis And o thing greuith me most
of all thou settust not by my passion that ^ suffered full sore for thy sake
But with thine horrible swering thou vpbyoydeste me with many great othis by
mine head eyes arms nails sides wounds fete bones be mine heart and be my
passion that thou sholdiste do worship to thou doste great spite and repreue



we read in the gestis of to maynes that an Emperor sent a great man to a
land to be a justice and or he come there no man in that country could swear
no oath but ye and nay. but when this Justice come a monge hem he made the
people to swear one bokys in sessiones and yafe hem chargis and so the people
took ensample of this justice to swear as he and his men did be our lordis
passion sydys Arms nails face wounds blood heart and so forth and took hit
so in use that the common people swore as they deed.

Than on a day as the justice sat in his office and chargid the people there
come to fore him a fair woman clothid all in grene and brought a feyre child
in her lap all blody and all to martered his head all to pryckyd his face
disfigured his eyes out his arms brokyn his hondis smetyn thourghe his naylys
cut and his fete cut from his leggrs his sydis all to rent his bowels and
his her te drawn out of his body. Thanne seyde this woman to the Justice.
what are they worthy to have that have thus do to my child and he seyde they
were worthy to have death. Thanne said she thou and thyn men with your horible
othis have thus dismembered my sweet sone ihesu criste that am I modyr un to and
thus ye have taught all your country where fore thou shalt have thy own
don^e and so in sight of all the people the earth opened and the justice fill
down to hell. and than the people were sore a gaste and they left all soche
great othis and ded a mende her lives and so late us leave all our othis and
leave as criscen shul de do and reverence the passion of our lord ihesu criste
that was cause of our redemption be the which we shall come to ever lastyng
bliss that never shall have end.

Dm^ca palmaru^.
GOod frendis as ye know well yt this day is callid Palm sunday but for
because that the service of this day is long I will tell you shortly why hit
is callid Palm sunday as seint johan seyth our lord ihesu criste come to
Betanye where he seythe Venit ihesus beta^^a^ vbi lazarus fuit mortuus que^
resusuitauit. And there he raised lazar from death to live that hade ley.iiij.
days deed and this lazarus was brothir to mary mawdeleyne and to martha that
was a nothir suster. Thanne ihesus wyste that his passion was nyghe and took
Lazar with him and rydyng on an ass he come toward iherusalem. and when the
people herd there of the people went ayense him. Non propter ihesum tantum sed
vt lasarum videre^t quem resuscitauit a mortuis. Not only for ihesu but for to
see lazar that was resyn from de^he to live and also for to see criste and do
him worship Acceperu^t remos palmarum and sternebant in via. They took
branches of palm and other flowers and strawed in the wey a yense his coming
And sum sprade her clothis in the wey and song Benedictus qui venit in
nomine domini. Blessed be he that comythe in the name of our lord king of
israhel where for holy church makyth this day solemn procession in mind of
the procession yt was made ayense crist. and also joy and myrthe of our
resing from death to live that has leyne all this year in dedly syn. now y
trust to god that they be resyd to god leuyng And for angeles of heaven make
much joy of your rising out of syn And thus we take palm and flowers in
procession as they did and go in procession knelyng to the cross in the
worshi^ and mind of him that was done one the cross worshippyng and well
coming him with song in to the church as the people ded our lord in to the
cite of iherusalem

Thanne johan bellet askithe a question and seith that criste had the grettest
worship rydyng one the ass that ever he had in this world Tha^ why
worship we the cross and not the ass to this question he answerithe him
self and seyth that the worship of this world as Salamon said All is but a
vanite and naught and makithe to for get a man his god and him self There as
great tribulacione dissese and heaviness causithe a man to think of god and
^rye to him for socoure and help and to know him self And there for all
christian people should put a wey all worldely vanitees that bryngythe much
people to great my scheue and many to ever lastyng pain. we worship the
cross for hit was cause of our redemption and salvation and to bring us to
ever lastyng joy and bliss that we hopyn all to come to Thanne anon when
criste was come to the cite of iherusalem he went to the temple and drove out
all buyers and sellers that he fonnde there in and seyde Domus mea do mus
oracionia vocabitur My house is a house of preyouris and ye make hit a den of
theuys Thus our lord yafe all christian people en sample to leave byyng and
sellyng on the holy day and in special in church. A nothir hit is why hit is
callid palm sunday for be cause that palm be tokenythe victory where all
criste^ people should bear palm in processione in tokenyng that he had
foughten with the fend and has the victory of him be shryfte of mouth
satisfactione with deed mekely done his penance with great contricione in his
heart and in this wise overcome his gostly enemy the fend we read in the
gestis of romans y^ it was the manner sum time. that if there were any lord
that were rebel a yense the Emperor a none the Emperor would send sum
worthy knight with great pissa^ ^^ of people to that land and put hem down
and make hem sogettys to the Emperor of rome And when this knight had
done so. than should he be set in a ch^ re ^ray^d with clothys of gold in
the best wise and a branche of palm in his hand in tokenyng that he had the
victory and with great worship brought in to rome but when he come in to
any worthy cite tha^ there should stand one by him and beat him in the mouth
with a branche of olyue sayng thus Anotholites this is to sey kowe thy self
that is to understand though^ thou be great now and have the victory make
not to much of thy self for hit may fortuue a nothir time thou maiste have
the worse and turn to much vylony. more than now to worship. where for ^e
not now to proud of thy self.

Thus should ye beat your self in the mouth of your soul with the branche
of olyne that is with the virtue of meekness and so bold you in love and meke
in her te and ever more dreding and feryng left he fall a yene in to sin And
so leave the worship^ that ye have now. For trust this trewly ^^^knesse is that
virtue that most and so ^este over comes your gostely enemy the fend and
souneste gaderithe a man to vertuos leuyng that we may have this virtue of
meekness patience and charity to over come our gostly enemy now and ever Amen

GOod frendis ye shall understand that holy church vsid these three days and
seythe service in the euyntyde that is meekness where for we call hit
tenables. But holy church callid hit tenebras Than why this service is thus
done in mekeuesse holy fadres tellithe for three causis One is the night
before that our lord ihesu crist was take he went un to the mount of olyuete
and preyde thus Pater misipassibile est transeat a me calix iste My fadyr if it
be possible that this bitter passion may pass fro me if it were the fader is
will and else not And for dread and fere of that bitter passion that he field
in his sperit he sweet both blood and watyr A nothir cause is this that a no^
aftir myd night come judas with ^. knyghtis and much other people to take
criste and for hit was myrke and they could not well know him from seynte
james he was so like criste there for judas seyde Quem osculatus ^^ero ipsum
em^ tenete For sothe quod he him that I shall kiss it is take ye him for seint
james was so like criste that much people callid him cristus brothir and thus
judas be trayed his mastyr and thus was criste take in meekness with all the
spite that they cowde do to him beting him and spetyng in ^his face. The
thrydde cause is when criste was naked on the cross fete and hand hangyng
three ow rys from vnderyn till none Thanne the son with drowe her light and
was ^er^e thourghe all the world showing that the makyr of light was at that
time payned to death for these three causis the service in the night is done in
myrkenesse. the which service makyth mind how judas betrayed criste and how
jews come as preuely as they ^oude for dre de of the common people where for to
the service is no bell ronge but a sound made of tree where all christian p^eple
may have knoweliche to come to this service preuely with out making of any
noise and all that the people should speak of coming and going should sound of
the tree that is the cross that our lord was done upon and of his passion and
of the wordys that our^ lord spoke ha^gyng on the cross and howshe seyde to
his modyr Mulier ecce filins tuns w^man see thy son and how he commanded his
modyr to seint johan the evangelist in keeping and what seyde the these that
hyng by him and said thus. Domine ^nan^o v^neris in reg^um tuum memento me^.
Lord when thou comyste to thy kingdom have mind of me and a none our lord
said to him. Hodie me^umeris in paradiso. This day thonshalte be with me in
paradyse and how he took his spertte in to his faderis handis and seyde In
manus tu^s domine ^^. and so he yield up the ghost thus coming and going to the
church all christian people should common and leave vanite and ydill talkyng and
speak only to the cross that is o^^e redemption ^ no their cause is when that
^udas hadde^ be trayed tris^e and saw by his treson he should be deed ano^ he
fill in despair and honge him self on a tree and than he displesid more criste
for that deed tha^ for all the trespass that he had done to fore for criste is
so merciful that and he had asked mercy he hulde have had mercy and for

I find that Alysau^dyr necham tellith how that there was sumtyme a knight
that went out of his own country fe^ in to a strange land to seek auentures
and hit hap pid he come in to a great foreste and there he her d^ a great noise
of a best that seemed in dispire and than he wolte wete what hit mente and
went ne re and saw how a gret^ horrible addy^ and of great lenghte be clippyd
a lion and bunde him to a tree as he lay and slepid and when the lion woke he
found him self bound and might not help him self ^e made a great horrible
noise de ^yryng help of the knight tha^ had this knight compassion on this
lion and would feign have help but he dradde wha^ he was lou se left he would
have fallyn to him but be cause he was knight and the lion was king of all
bestis in that distress he took his sword and smote addyr a sondy^ Than a
none the lion felt him self louse and fill down to the knyghtys fete and
ever aftyr night and day in every place he followed the knight and every night
the lion lay at this knyghtys beddis fete and in every battle the lion was
ready to help his maistre in so much that the people spoke to the knyte of the
lion yet be counsel of much people he had the lion in suspecte where for
wha^ he went in to his own country a yene p^uely while the lion sleppe he
took the watyr and went in to ship and seylid for the and when this lion
woke and myssid his ma^tyr a none he y^^e a great roryng and went aftyr him in
to the sea and swam aftyr him as he might and wha^ his might sailed thann he
was drowned. By this knight ye may understand goddis sone of heaven that come
out of far country that was out of heaven in to this world and was bound
for mankind with this old addyr the fend to a tree of in obed ience where for
with the sharp sword that was his passione he lousid mankyde out of his
boundis and made him fre to goo where he would And there for all christian people
be bou^dyn to worship him and thank him for his lousing and to be buxum to
him all the time that they leave and follow and sewe the lore of holy church And
he shall pass thourghe the watyr that is to sey thourgh the pain of death and
he shall come to the joy that ever shall last with outyn end the which god
bring us all to Amen

Diverse questions Any men wolle ask diverse questio^ns of the service of
these days of soche prystes that they suppose can not make no ready answer to.
but put him to shame and do to him vyloni and rep^uith where for I have te
telith which be needful for every priest to know and if he woll look hit ready
and keep hem ready in heart he may make ready answer and so shall hit be to him
both profit and worship. First if a man ask how she rethursday is callid
so* ye may sey that in holy church it is callid Ce^^ domini our lordis soper
day for that day ^e souped with his disciples opynly and aftyr souper he gafe
hem his flesche and his blood to ete and to drink and seyde thus. Accipite et
mand^ rate hoc est corpus meum Take ye this and ete it for hit is mine own body
and a none aftyr he woshe all his disciples fete showing what meekness that
was in him and for the great love y^ he had to hem It is also in englische
callid shere thursday for in old fadres days the people would that day shere
her head dis and clippe her berdis and do down her he dys and so make hem
honest a yene estyr day. for on good friday they do her bodies none ese but to
suffer penance in mind of him that that day suffered his passion for all
mankind. on Estyr even it was time to here her service and aftir service make
holy day.

Hit is wreton in the lyffe of a seynte that he was so besy on the saturday
before none that he made ^'man to shave him aftyr none than was the f^nde ready
and gaderyd us the heris than this h^ly man saw that and commanded him to tell
why he did so than seyde he thou doste no reverence to thy holy day therefore
wolle keep these heris till the day of dome in great rep^ue to the Than a non
he left of shauyng and took these heris from the fend and made to brenne hem
in his own hand to suffer penance and so a bode vnshauyn till mo^day aftyr
This is said to all tho in rep^ue that worship not the saturday at aftir
none. Than as Johan Bellet seithe on there thursday a man should do down his
head and clippyn his berde and a pryste should shave his crown so that there
should no thing be between god and him for heris come of superfluite of veins
and of humures of the stomach and they should pare her nails of hands and fete
that comythe of superfluite of fylthe with out forth and shryue hem and make
hem clean with in his soul as with out. And thus make him clean both with in
and with out The while that all this lenton has be drawyn between us and the
quere be tokenithe the passione that was hid and vnknowyn till the days come
the which these days be done a way ande the Auter opynly shewde to all the
people for these days criste suffered his passion opyniy that he had haugyng
on the cross. Consummatum est it is endid that is to sey. now the prophecy of
my passion has an end. where for the clothis of my auter be takyn a wey For
cristis clothis were takyn a wey from him. and so was done nakid on the cross
save as our lady his modyr wont a kercoffe about him to cover his membris.
The auter stone be tokenythe cristus body that was drawyn on the cross as a
skin of perch meant on a harow so that all his bonis might be told

The besemes that the auter is wechyn with be tokenythe the s^ourgys that they
betyn our lor dis body with and the thorns that he was crouned with The watyr
and the wine that it is waschyn with be tokenythe the blood and the watir that
ran down fro his woundis that was in his side peryshyd with a spear The wine
that is poured upon the auter on the v. crossis be tokenith the blood that
ran down from his principalle wondis of his body. Also this day is no paxe
yeuen at the mass for Judas be trayed crist this uyght with a cosse this was
the prophecy of his passion this day endid. where for this night wha^ he had
soupyd he made the sacrament of his own body and gaffe hit to his disciples to
ete and drink and began the sacrament of the mass and of the new law and
aftyr souper he wysche his disciples fete that was a manner of the new law
full out for as he seyde to Petyr he that is washin and is clean of dedely syn
has no need to be waschyn it be tokenythe the affliction of venial sins
Than if people ask why prystes do not mass aftyr fouper as criste deed It
was turned in to more honest and more saluacione to man's soul for as Hyamo
tellith upon the pistell of seint Poule that many in the beginning of the
feythe comythe to church on sherethurday and tho that were rich bryngithe
mete and drink with hem and eton and drynkyn her belyes full and than at
night tokyn her hosell and seyde that criste gafe hem ensample Lu^ when the
rich e^e and drink to much the pore people a bydythe with out till aftyr
the rich has done fore an hu^gerid and than eton of the releffe that they
left. and so aftyr the people took her hosell. where as the pistell of this
day tellithe. saint poule rebukithe hem there of and turned that foul use in
to more honest and clennes and holiness. that is for to sey mass fasting all
people to take her hosell fasting on estyr even the pascall is made the chief
tapir in the church So is criste chief above all the seyntis in heaven The
pascall also be tokenyth the pelour of light fere that went before moses and
the children of israhel when moses ladde hem out of Egipte in to the land of
be hefte that is Iherusalem and so they passid save and sound. And so vij.
days aftyr they come all in to these and thankyd god for her passage. And in
mind here of holy church vsithe all the Estyr woke to go a processione to
the founte that is now the reed see to all christian people that be cristened in
the fouute for the watyr in the founte be tokenythe the read see for blood and
watyr is the wou^des that were in cristus sydys in the which the power of
pha^^o the fend of hell is drowned and all his might lost and christian people
failed and for the founte is hallowed on Estyr even and one wytson even for in
the beginning all children a bode to be cristeued one these.ij. days and to be
cristoned at the founte halowyng But now for because that many in so long
abydyng were ded with out cristendome. where for holy church ordained now to
cristo^ all times of the year save viij. days before these evenys the child
shall abide to the founte halowyng if it may for parell of death and else not.

Thus is the paschall hallowed be light with new fire and of hit all othyr
taperis and candellis be light for all hoolynesse and good techyug and good
leuyng comythe of criste and techyng of holy church and lightithe hem in
cristus passione with brennyng love and charity Pecys of ensence he styckyde in
the paschall in the manner of a cross tho be tokenith the v. wounds of our
lord as Bede seythe that he suffered in his body that shall be frecsche and
sweet as any ensence till the day of dome to great rep^ue to all that shall be
dampened that believe not in cristis passion and woll not ask mercy and
foryenesse of her sins. In the founte halowyng the pryste cast watyr in the
iiij parties of the founte for crisce hade his disciples going prechyng and
techyng m four parties of cristome in the name of the fadyr and the sone and
the holy ghost

And aftir the pryste bre thithe one the watyr for the holy ghost in making of
the world was borne upon watres for when god for adames syn cursed the earth
and land. he cursed not the watyr* where for it is lawful to a man to ete in
lento^ that ^omythe of the watyr

Aftyr he dropythe the wex in to the watyr of a candell brennyng the which
betokenythe the ma^hode of criste that was fullyd in watyr and puttith oil and
creme in to the watyr for by the virtue of the sacrament tho that be in heaven
and in earth be joined to gedyr and that was preuyd be cristus baptyme for
there the fadyr of heaven spoke and seyde Hic est filin^ me^a dilectus in ^^^
michi been complacui This is my well-beloved sone that woll plese me. And the
holy ghost was seyne Sicut culumba As a white do ue thus was the fou^te
hallowed. ij. tyme^ in the year. At wytsontyde and at Estyr when all the people
is brought out of thraldom be cristus passion from the danger of the fend
and at wytsontyde for than is the holy ghost yeuen in remission of all sins.
Than from the founte the people gothe to the quere syngyng the latanye preyng
all the seyntys of heaven to prey to god to give to all that be cristyn to keep
that worthy sacrament to goddis plesaunce and the couenaunte that they have
made in her cristonyng. Than the priest gothe to the mass for criste that is
head of all holy church is not reason. kyrieleysou is seyde. for i^ every
preyoure in especial in the mass it is great need to ask help and so cour
of god to keep us from all manner of temptaciones that the fend puttith in us
and namely in goddis service Gloria in excelsia is seid for the fadyr of heuyne
has great joy to be hold the people that his so ne has boughte with his
passione and to see hem in rest pese and charity echone with other. The greyle
is not seyde for tho that be few cristoned be not yet perfect to walk in
grace of ^tuous Alleluya is said for it is great joy to angeles to se be
cristonyng the nombre of hem restored a yene Aftyr alleluya a tracte is seyde
hey songen for though be cristonyng they be wasche from synyit must the
travel besely to keep hem from co^beraunce of the fend that they fall not in
dedly syn The offertory is seyde for the wyme^n that come^ with oyntementys to
offer to cristis body they found him not in his to^ be Agnus dei is seyde but
no pax give for criste that is head of pes is not yet reason The post common is
not seyde for tho that be new cristoned should not be hoseled this day but on
the morrow for in old time there come to cristonyng people of great age Than a
short euynsonge is done for the children that were not cristoned. where of
gretely they where noyed with sickness of cold of long service thanne is
endid under a short Colet of all the sacrament of cristonyng is endid in the
passione of Criste by the which all christian people were restored to ever
lastyng bliss to the which god bring us all to Amen.

In die paraschene.
GOod frendis this day is callid god friday for all that our lord ihe su criste
suffered this day turned us to great joy for this day he suffered passione
vndyr pounce pylate fore our sake Hit is an old say that a foul be gynuyng
has a foul endyng. Now se how this pylat be ganne cursidly and endyd full
wrechidly for as seynte Austen seythe cursed leuyng furste askith a cursed end
aftyr he that for getith him self here in his leuyng is full like to for get
himself in his last end.

This pylat was a knights sone that was callid Tyrus that gate him of a woman
that hyghte Pyle and this woman nes fadyr hyghte at. so when this child
was borne they set the moderys name and the gru^de fadyr after and so by
both names callid him Pylat Than after when he was of.iij. year of age his
modyr brought him in to the knights court to his fadyr Than had the knight a
nothir sone ny like to pylates age but for this knyghtys so ne was in all his
reule more gentillere more manfully more godly more beloved than this pylate.
so for hate and for enuy^ there of this pylat one a day slew this knyghtys
sone than was the knight wondyr sorry but yet he would not sle pylat aut sent
him to rome to be there in hostage for a tribute that the knyt should pay to
the emperor Thanne hit happid that the king of france had sent his sone
thedir for the same cause Thanne for be cause when pylate saw that he was more
beloved and cherisched and than this pilate slew him Than for he was so cursid
the emperor be counsel of the romans sent pylate in to a country that was
callid pounce where that the people of that country were so cursid that they
slew any that come to be maystre over hem So when this pilate come thethir he
applied him to her maneres so what with wyles and sotilte he overcome hem and
had the maystry and gate his name and was callid pylate of pounce and had great
domynacion and power Thanne the king of iherusalem sent aftyr him and made him
leave tenant vndyr him of the lond^^ of jury And for pilate lyked well the
office preuely he sent to the Emperor and had his office confermed of him
vnwetyng to the king herod king that time where fore when king herod herd
what he had done he was so wroth and they were enemies un to the time that
our lord ihesu criste was take and thanne they be come fren disayene and fill
both in to one assent of cristis death. Thanne happyd hit aftyrwarde that the
Emperor fill sike and sent aftyr criste fore to hele him for hit was told
him that criste helid all that ever would come to him of all manner of
sykenesse what sum ever sykenesse hit had be But thanne had pylate done him
to death or the messengere come Than when the Emperor understand that he
sent for pylate and made him come to him. and when pilate herd^ this he was
sore a ferde and took one Cristus cote^* And so when he come to rome to the
Emperor All tho that were in present made pylate good chere all the while
that he had on Cristus cote And the emperor swore be fore that he should be
deed. Than took they of the cote and a none as the cote was of the Emperor was
so w^othe with pilate that he put him in to a prison till he had take
counsel what death that he should dye on. Than as soon as pylate woste and
understand that he should be deed he took his own knyfe and slew himself
with all. And when the Emperor herd there of and understand that he had
slain him self and thanne a none he made to teye a great stone a bowte
pylates neck and to cast him in to a watyr that is callid Tybir thanne when
he was cast in there the fendis made soche a noise there a boute that all the
Cite of rome was sore a freyed of hem.

Thanne when the Emperor saw this he made to take him up ayene and than was
he cast in to a watyr that was betwixe to hye hills and sollonge time astyr
there was in the watyr many horrible sightes said a bowte that cursed man.

Thus our lord ihrsu criste suffered passion and death for all mankind and
furste when he was take they did buffete him and stripyd him naked and beat
him with stourgis A vertice capitia vs^ ad plantis pedmn non fuit in eo sanitas
that fro the highheste place of his he de to the sole of the fete was no thing
left hole one him but all raw and aftyr made a croune of thornys and set hit
on his head and beat hit down with st^^ys of reed that hit perischyd his
brain and when they had peyned him so they lad de him forth all blody
Admontem cal^arie. To the mount of calnarye to the end of death yet wymmen of
the Cite when they sighe him so foul fare with and all to luggi^ and to draw
for very pit they wept upon him. Tha^ seyde our lord to hem Nolite flere
super me sz super vos et filios vestros. ye wymmen of iherusale^ weep ye not
for me but upon you and your children. for there shall days come in the
which ye shall bliss the wombes that were bareyne and the pappys that never
gave socke. Thus our lord preached be fore the vengeance that fill aftyr upon
iherusalem. The which prophecye Jeremye the prophet spoke of that is radde in
holy church these three days at tenebras the which was so horible of many
diverse myscheuys and in special of hou^ger that children lay for hounger deed
in the stretis Than was there a woman was come of great birthe that for hunger
took her own child that fed with her pappys and slew hit and partid hit in
ij. parties and than she rostyd half and that other half she kept till on
the morrow. Thanne as people come by the street they had sauoure of the roast
and anon they come in to have had part there of and when they saw the modyr
roste her own child and sone they were heavy and foul dismayed and would notte
ete there of but went their wey forth ayene. Than took the modyr of that
child and ete there of and seyde in this manner wise this is mine own sone and
mine own child that I bare of my body and fed hit with my pappys but yet I
wolle rathir ete hit than dye for hunger There for I tell yew this for to show
yew somewhat of the vengeance that fill in the cite of iherusalem aftir the
death of our lord ihesu criste Thanne they ladde him to the mount of Caluarye
and there they s^reyned so on the cross that every bone of his body might be
known on from a nothir and naylyd him hand and fete to the cross and they
gave up the cross and the body to gedyr and with a great peyse they let the
cross and the body fall down to gedir in to the morteyse that all the body
dasch^d and all his bones crakyd and his joints braste and ^eynes and all
wou^des braste out of blood sydis arms legs fete and bonds so that there
left no blood in him And ^^^ they took a clothe wlyle the blood was hot and
wonde hit a boute his body till the blood was cold and than they drew away the
clothe and pullid away the flesche from the bones this was a great pite. And so
when he should dye he began as Johan Hellet seythe. Deus meus respice in me And
so seyde all verses sewyng till he come un to that verse. In te domine speram.
And so at this verse An manus tuas domine commendo spiritum meum redemisti me
domine deus veritatis. There he gave up the spirit This is a great ensample
that our lord ihesu Criste ^n to all christian that every man should have in
mind these verses And he that can hem s^y and if he sey hem ^uery day he shall
not dye no manner myscheuous nor rengeable death. Thann^ aftyr this passi on we
sey orysons and knelyng at every orison save at that orison that is seyde for
the iewis at that orison holy church knelith not for be cause jew ysm scorn
knelyng three times to criste wha^ they scourgid him Thanne these orisones holy
church preyith for all manner of people for iewis sarise nes cysmatys heretikis
but not for christian people for while any man or woman stonte a cursed he is
dampened be fore god and dampened shall be at his death but he repent him and
amend him while he leuith in this p^sente world But take he de what seint
Auste^ seith Siscirem pro certo^nod ^ater meus esset in in^erno non ^r arem pro
illo nisipro diabolo. if I wyste for a truth that my fadir were dampened in to
hell I would never prey for him but as for the deuell of hell. for there is no
preyoure of holy church that helpithe a dampened man. Than aftyr these orisones
the cross is brought forth to the which all christian people should worship
this day in worship of him that this day dyed on the cross and to prey to
our lord ihesu criste to for give us all our tree space as criste preyde to
his fadyr of heaven to for give hem that ded him on the cross



There was a knight sum time and that was a great lord and he has a worthy
man un to his sone. And so hit hapyd that a nothir knight and this man fille
at debate and so this knight slew him. where fore the fadyr of this man
that was deed gade ryd a great multitude of people and pursewed that other
knight where so ener he went to have sleyne him night and day so that he
might have no rest but ever de de fley for fere of his lyffe. Thanne hit
happyd on a good friday this knight saw all christian people go to the church
And he be thought him that criste dyed that day on the cross for all man kind
and put him only in the mercy of almighty god and went to the church with
other people to serve god and when he was in the church a non this other
knight had word and come with much people in to the church and his sword
drawn in his ho^de for to sle him and wha^ this other knight saw that and
wyste well that he had trespased him and fill down flat to the ground
with his arms spradde a broad as our lord ihe su crist sprad de his armies on
the cross and seyde. For his love that this day sprad de his armies on the ercss^
and suffered passion and dyed for the and me and all mankind have thou mercy
one me and for give me thy sons death.

Thanne this knight thought hit had be to horrible a thing to smite him
while that he lay so and cried him mercy so mekely and a none he put up his
sword and seyde to him Now for his soue that this day dyed on the cross for
the and me and all m^^yn de I for give the and to ke him up and kyssed him and
a none went to gedyr aftyr un to do worship to the cross knelyng And when
this knight word have kyssed the fete of the cross the Image low sid his
armies from the crosset be clippyd the knight a boute the neck and kyssyd him
and spal e thus that all the people herd I for give the as thou haste fore
yeuen fore the love of me. and thus all christian people should do. and than they
should have mercy and grace of god and bliss ever lastyng.

There was sum time an holy bishop that preyde often besyly to god that he
might have grace to see and know which were worthy to receive that holy
sacrament and come to goddisbo^d Than on a time as he should hosell the people
he saw some come with her faces as read as blood and blood dropyd out of her

Ascensio dm^
GOod friend is so che a day ye shall have an high and a solemn feste in
holy church that is callid the ascension of our lord the su Criste for that
day as the feythe and be leave techith how god is very god and man and styed up
in to heaven where fore in tokenyng of this the paschpll that is the chief
light in holy church that has sto^de openly in the quere from Estyr un to
this day Now hit is remeuyd a wey in tokening that criste is chief light in
holy church and so our lord diverse times openly apperithe to his disciples
and taught hem the feythe and the believe and this day hestyghed up in to heaven
and there wolle a ^y^e un to the day of dome. But now ye shall here the manner
of this ascension from escyr day unto this day he was not with his disciples
algates but diverse times appeared un to hem and he appeared to hem as they satyn
at her mete and ete with hem to show he^ that he was very god and man in
flesche and blood as they were For sum of hem they were in dowte left he
had be a spirit that has no(...) flecsche nor blood and there for to preue
the trowthe he ete with hem in her sight and badde hem go^ in to the hill of
olyue. and there in fight of all his disciples he blessed hem and styed up in
to heaven and left the steps of his fete thirst down in to the hard
marbull stone for a tokyn of his asce^sion Thanne ye shall understand that the
hill of olyuete be tokenithe merry where for criste styed up at the hill of
olyuete showing well that he is the head of mercy and he is ever ready to give
mercy to all that askithe mercy with meke heart. Thanne in his up rising as we
call Ascension angeles made so much melodye that no tongue may tell it so feign
they were of his coming Ascen dit velociter he styed up swyftely for as it were
a moment he was from earth to heaven A great clerk a philosouer y^ is callid
^abymoyses he seyth that it is as fer from earth to heaven as a holy man might
leave a thousand year and every day go a thousand mile. But he that met this
wey knowithe best. and this wey shall be met of a ryghtfull and a good man.
Thanne in his ascension he had with him a great multitude of fowls the which
he f^tte out of hell from the fendes bonds He styed up al so with his wounds
read fresche and blody And as bede seythe for v. causes. Furste for to very fie
the feyth of his resur rection for he wse in very flesche and blood that dyed
on the cross for all mankind. The secounde to show his wounds to his fadyr
in great help and socoure to all mankind. The thridde is to show how
ryghtfull they be da^ pned that woll not bele ue in his passion and in his
resurrection The four the isto show how merciful he is to them that woll be
leave and ask mercy. The.v. is that he bare with him a sign of victory for a
sykernesse to all mankind for like as a lord is siker that ha the a true
aduoket be for a Auge to answer fore him so in sikernesse to all mankind we
find him our aduket ener more ready to answer for us at thing that the fend
ou re gof^ly enemy makyth a yense us. where for seith the holy scripture a sike
rer attorney may no man be but god. Dbi matter oste^dit fill io pe ct as et
vhera. where for the modir showed the sone here breasts and her pappes Filius
patri latus et vulnera

The sone shewde to the fadyr his fides all to beto^ and his wounds bledyng
how should any thing be put a wey or deuydyd there as soch tokenes of love be
showed he may not fare a mysse that has soch to friend is in the country of
heaven Also by the steyng up in to heaven of our lord ihesu criste man has
gotyn a great dig^^te for a man to see his own kind and his own flesch and
hisblode sittyng on the right side of the fadyr of heaven in his trone where
for Angelus conderyng the dignite of man they would not suffer no man to do he^
worshipp^ ^^ they deed be fore the in ^^^^acion of our lord ihesu criste but
they worship men for god himself has take mankind on him and is now in
heuene bodily. Here by may a man see how much he is be hold to his god that
we where bound be fore and therll to the fend of hell and now we be made fre
of all that. and our lord ihesu criste has give un to man a fredome a bo^e
any Angeles. And there fore we be bound to him to do him service reverence and
worship. And there as Angeles sommetyme kepton the gatis of paradyse with
brennyng swerdis that no soul might come in. Now by feythe our lord ithesu
criste to mankind he has cast up the gatis and warn no man to enter there
in that is of stede^asee believe for as seynte Austeyn seythe. Apperuisti
credentibus regna celdr^n Thou hasee opened the gatis of heaven to them that be
leave

Also ye shall be leave right as a king of this world has in his country
officeris of diverse de grees sum higher and sum lower and sum more
preuyer thanne sum. So our lords steyng up at this time the lower Angel
for great woundre that they had in cristus Ascensione when they saw him in
flesche and blood steyng up to heuene with so great multitude of fo^les with
him And also for the great woundre that they had when they saw the fendes
of the air fly a wey for dread and fere of his sc^onge coming that be fore
were wont sparyng no thing to assail the souls that come by them and thanne
they flow^ fore great fece of this coming. Also the good Angeles come in all
the haste that they might to do our lord the sucriste service reverence and
worship. Thus for great woundre that the lower angel had of his freyng up
they asked the higher angel and they seyde. Quis est iste qui venit de edom
what is this that comythe out of the world with blody clothys as he were a king
of joy. This is he that with death sufferyng ready in his stour gyng sike and
deed in the cross strong in hell bodily in doing ferfull in rising and thus
has over come all his en myes and now is king glorious in heaven.

Thanne when our lord thesu criste was sty ed up in to heaven and than his
disciples stondyng with his modyr for great woundre of that sight and also of
the me lodye that they herd in the air they lokyd up in to heaven and suddenly
ij. Angeles clothid all in white stowde by hem and seyde. Diri galilei qui
statis aspicientes in celum hi^ est ihesus qui assu^ptus est a vobis.

Men of gelilee what sto^ de ye be holdyn in to heaven it is Ahesus that is
styed up from you and so he shall come at the day of dome a yene and deem all
quycke and deed

And there for all christian people lift up you re hertis to our lord ^he su
criste that now is styed up in to heuene and s^^tythe at his fadir right hand
and is ready to give mercy to all them that woll ask mercy with a meke heart.

And here fore there is no manner a man that may excuse him self nor have no
manner excusacion but if that woll himself and ask mercy to his lord god with
a meke heart and he shall have mercy and shall be sauyd ^^^ though a m^an be
never so sinful and he woll ask mercy with a meke heart he wolle give him
mercy. For contritu^et humiliatum deus non despiciea. A meke and a contrite her
te god shall never despice for and he wolle ask mercy and be sorry for his
sins our lord wolle take him to his mercy. Thanne for to show his great
goodness and compassion that our lord ha the of mankind A shall tell you
this ensample.



we read in the syffe of seinte Carpe how a man of mysse believe turnyd a
christian man out of his feythe and for soke his believe and his cristendo me
where fore this holy man Carpe was so wroth that he fill in great sykenesse
and when he shul de have preyde to god for a mendement he preyde night and day
that he might see hem have a bodily vengeance Tha^ hit happid at a
mydenyghte as he preyde thus suddenly the house that he lay ynne cleuyd in four
partis And he looked up and saw one honged so piteusly that hit was great pite
to se and than he lokyd up to heaven and there he saw our lord ihesu Criste
with a great multitude of angeles sittyng in his trone. and he lokyd up again
and than he saw this ij. men stondyng be fore an hot te ouyn quakyng and
tremelyng for dread of fend is like adderis and worms coming out of the ouyn
to draw the se ij. men in to the ouyn with hem. And so many other fendis come
in diverse likeness to help that they were into the ouyn Thanne was this holy
man Carpe feign to see these ij. men have that vengeance and was wou^ dre
glad there of that he lost the sight of our lord thesu criste and his
holy angelis for his heart was all one these ij. me^nes vengeance and was
sorry for it was so long or they were put un to her pain And than he rose and
went to him self and halpe all that ever he might and wha^ they were in to
the ouyn than was this Carpe very glad there of And than he lokyd up in to
heaven and there he saw our lord Jhesu criste and he saw him rise from his
trone for great pit and compassione that he had on the too men and come
down to hem and took hem out of her pain and seyde thus to Carpe Extend
manus tuas contra me Streche forth thine hondys ayense me and seyde thus I am
ready and need were to dye ayene for mankind rathir than to lose him.

^e this ensample ye may see how ready that our lord ihesu criste is to all
that wolle ask mercy and for yeuenesse and deserve mercy that is that every
man a mende and leave his sins and be in full will and purpose to sin no
more and thus he shall come to the grace and mercy of our lord ihesu criste
that suffered for us and all man kind one good friday and this day styed up to
heuene the which he woll grant us and bring us all there to Amen

dedely sin and angelus woll stop her nosys for much more fowler stinkith
dedely sin in the sight of god thanne does any careyn to smell to the people
and as the holy ghost fleth to hem that bydith in good lyffe and clean and in
parfyte love and charity and has pit and compassione of alletho that be in
any dissese or tribulacion to soch the holy ghost visitithe and comyth to. And
with soche as him listith to come to a bide and com(...)th and techith hem ^^
all need But as the service of this feste is more preysed than any othyr time
for as this feste holy church callith to hem and seythe Deni sancte spiritus.
Come holy ghost specially to have help and socoure and grace and to have part
of the dole that he makithe at this time to all christian people that be abell
to receive his yiftes. But ye shall understand that the holy ghost makith his
dole in other wise than other people. For they dele as hit likith he^ but the
holy ghost delithe to all the people that is needful and spedfull to hem that
y^^te and sum more and sum less one yifte and sum anothir some he yeuith
wisdom in holy scripture to understand holy scripture he yeuith grace to
have great lust and lykyng there ynne that is for to sey they be lusty to
preche and to teache virtue and goodness and e^ form the people to the hele of
their souls unto them that here hit and bear hit awey. But many had lever to
here a song of robynhode or tale of rebaudry where for goddis word shall not
be p^chith to soche. And sum he yeuithe grace so in understanding of diverse
langage As Englische French walche Irische with out any great travail in
lernyng hit is a great yifte and a miracle and a special grace of almighty god
that any man can understand our in spekyng There be v. letteres that makythe
all the words of all the world and of all langages that be under heuene. And
with out one of these letteres may no manner a man make no word and that been
these (...) A E I ^ and D*

And also sum he yeuithe grace of counsel for to do aftyr good counsel And
sum he enspirith with ynn for they that he shewith hem and makith them to
know to fore what woll come aftyr and fall And ye^ithe hem grace to de^e the
better from the worcester se where for they do so wisely and discretly that all the
people be glad to here hem speak and to do aftyr her counsel.

And sum he yeuithe grace also to do aftir co^sell as our lord ihesu criste
gave him self counsellyng a man that would leave a parfyte lyffe to leave all
that he has and go in to a religion and be there governed by his wardeynes
counsel and by his own this counsel comyth of god And sum he ^^^th also
grate of sufferyng much bodily sykenesse gr^te wrongs and much dissese both
in body and in soul loss of catell lordeshippes mastershippes frendis and all
that he sufferithe with a meke heart thankyng almighty god of his sonde this
comyth of the grace of the holy ghost. Also he yeuithe sum grace of lernyng
in diverse science sum to learn one craft and sum anothir so be ^he which
he may get his luyng with troth so th^^ a man woll put to hi^ good will and
his dilgence and trewly to labor and not to slo^^ ^^e and sleep slew the fuly
and unthrifty but ^ dew time to labor bes^ly the holy ghost has y^uen every
man somm^ knowing to get his luyng with truth. Also sum he geuythe grace
of pite and fills her hertes so full of pit^ and compassion of her euene
christian that he in dissese and aduersite that they yeuen hem of their goodis to

for cristus sake and also mercyable that they for give hem all that they have
trespased to hem in any wise. Sum he yeuithe also to d^^de god in so much
that they be ever a fe^de to displese almighty god and ever thynke^ of great
vengeance that god woll take for sin at the day of dome Tim^r domini
expellit peccatum. the dread of god and the horrible peynes of hell puttithe a
wey sin and thus nyghthe and day sum be ever a ferde to offend god and
ever besely to do well in preuyte as in opyn sight of people he that has
this yifte has a special grace of the holy ghost. Her sunt septem do na
spiritua sancti. These be the yeftes that, the holy ghost departid among all
mankind and yeuithe sum more than sum But there may no man excuse him but
that the holy ghost ^assignithe him somewhat of these in time of his cristonyng
where the bishopp^ at the confermacion rehersithe these words of the sacrament
I woll tell you an ensample to fere you the more to the sacrament of cristonyng
that is fou^den in the lysse of seynte James



There was an holy bishop that turned low is the king of France to christian
feythe and so when the king come to christian at the halowyng of the founte there
was great prese of people that the clerk that bare the bishops crismatory
might not bring hit to the bishop. and so when the font was hallowed and
come to the Anoyntyng he might not come to his crismatory. tha^ the bishop
lift up his eyes to god preyng god deuontly for help and a none there with
there come a done as white as any milk that was the holy ghost beryng in her
bill a violl with oil and creme to the bishop And when he opened the vyoll
there come out there of so sweet a savor that all the people had wo^dre there
of and were greatly comfortid there by and that co^tynued till the service was
done. Here by ye may well se though the priest sey the wordis the holy ghost
worchith the sacrament and does virtue of the words.

Now that the holy ghost may descend and lyghten in us that we may come to
receive him to our saluacione Amen.

GOod men and wymmen this day is callid wit sunday for be cause that this day
the holy ghost brought wit and wisdom in to cristus disciples. and so by
her prechyng aftyr in to all cristendome Than may ye understand that many
has wit but not wisdom for there be many that have wit to p^che well
and to sey well but there be few that has wisdom to do well There be many
wise p^chorys and techourys. but her leuyng is no manner thing aftyr her
prechyng. Also there be many that labourith to have wit and connyng but few
trauelith to come to good leuyng for who so have wytte^ and connyng to get
good with fair sotyll wordis be they never so false he is wise but wit of
holiness is not set by For he that can get good falsely with knackys and
mowus he is a wise man but he that for sakyth the wit of this world is ^
sole But look what holy scripture seythe Dominus recitauit nom^ pa^peris quia
ipsu^ approbauit et nome^ eins in libro scriptum fuit Our lord has received
the name of the poor man for he has preuyd him in his pouerte and wretyn his
name in the book of lyffe

Sed nomen diuitia tacuit quia ipsu^ no^ approbauit. But he left the rich man
for he has not preuyd him but thoug^^ a man be never so rich at the last
he shall be pore For naught he bryngythe with him but his good dedis and his
badde he that leuythe well and techithe well for a good ensample in leuyng is a
good doctrine. This grace as this day was yeuen to cristus disciples for they
taught well and leuyd well for they gave good informacion ^^ techyng of good
ensample in leuyng sore her techyng and her leuyng is sprad de a bowte in all
the world. Than how the come to this grace ye shall here Post ascensioneml
domini. Aftyr when that our lord ihesu criste was steyed up in to heaven his
disciples were in great heaviness and morning for they had de lost her maystre
that they louyd full well and for him had de lost all there goodys for his love
and for sake all her frenchipp^ and sewed him full pore in hope that they
should gretely be helped by him. And thus they were all heavy and gretely
stonyed and sore a ferde to be takyn of the ie^o es and cast in prison and
aftyr to be put to death

This made hem sorry that they durst not go a monge the people sore to get hem
mete and drink* but yet as criste badde hem in his ascension they went in to
the Cite of Iherusaleth and there they were in an halle of stage and there they
satte to gedyr preyng un to god with hole heart and one sperite of help and
socoure and sum comfort in her dissese Than as they were thus preing to
gedyr suddenly there was a great cloud made in the air like a blaste of
thoundre and even there with the holy ghost come among hem Et apparnerunt illis
dispertite liugne tan quam ignis. And light come down among hem in likeness
of to^ges brennyng and not smertyng warmyng and not hermyng lyghtenyng and not
flateryng Et repletisu^t omnes spiritu sancto And fillid hem full of gostly
wit for as they where to sore but lewd men of sight and un let tered and
verray Ideottes as of co^yng and nothing cowde of clergy suddenly they were the
wyseste men and the best clerks in the world And anon they spoke all manner
langages under the son and there as before her hertis was cold for dread and
for fere of death Thanne were they so comfortid with the holy ghost in brennyng
love that they went and preached and taught the word of god sparyng for no
dread but ready to take the death for cristus sake Thanne at that time there
were in Iherusale^ people of all nations and drew in to the temple for great
fere of the blaste of thoundre that was in the air and stodyed what hit might
be.

Thanne come the posteles in to the temple and preached and all manner nations
vndirstode hem and they vndirstode all manner nations and so they p^chyd the
word of god Thanne were the people a stoyned wha^ they herd the posteles speak
all manner of langages. Than seyde sum these have drunk so much must that
they wotte not what they do seye nothir what they mean for they be all dronkyn
Than answerde petir and seyde we be not drunk but this was the prophecy of
Iohell the prophet how the holy ghost should be yeuen plenteuous to the people
so that they should speak with all tongues that is to p^che and all in the
worlds the law of criste.

Thanne the people tuened fast and so with in sewe yeris the seythe was in all
the world. Now hit is to wete why the holy ghost more apperyd in to likeness
of tongues rathir than in any other party of man's body and why he come to hem
sittyng rathir than standing. As to the fursce this is the cause. a tongue is
the best membre of a man's body when hit is in* good rewle and well disposed
but when hit is out of rewle hit is the worsce. Denenum aspidum sub labiis
eorum Bitter veneme is under the tongues that speakithe evil seythe David in
the sawter. And as seint Ieme seythe Acursed tongue is fired with fire of hell
and may not be chastifid while the fire brennyth hit And also for tongues must
speak wordis of fire that is sharp and sperkelyng to sey truth and notte
spare in prechyng and techyng to repreue mys dedis for as holy men in old time
overcome and drove a wey the fire of lyghtenyng with holy words and good
preyoures with the brennyng love to god right for the fire of the holy ghost
should drive a weye and overcome the fire of hell that envy has and evil
leuyng that regnyth now in the tongues of much people and in her heart And for
the apostlis and other prechoris that comythe aftyr hem should speak brennyng
wordis that is neythir to sharp nothir for dread nor for love to sey the
truth and to tell the people her defautes and to repreue the sin that
regneth in he^ in many diverse wise and so to do and sey the word of god and
to repreue sin. and but they woll leave sin they shall with out remedy be
damned in to the fire of hell for though thou shuldiste dye spare not to
preche the word of god and tell the truth Item deus e^ misericors
penitentibus pecca tasua. Also god is merciful to them that be sorry for her
sins and woll leave hem T^m uero confessus fuerit et relinuerit ea
misericordia co^se qua tur For though a man have do never so much sin and
he woll shreyue him and for sake his sin mercy shall follow him and he shall
have for yeuenesse and so come to the bryghte fire ever lastyng bliss that is
the precious love of god that brennythe among angelis and seyntis in heaven
Also he comythe in likeness of tongues of fire for it is the kind of fire to
make low that is high and to warm that is cold to make soft that is hard
and make hard that is soft And also the holy ghost makythe hertis that be
high of pride and envy he makythe hem low and warm in love and charity and
also hard hertis that have be gaderyng and holdyng of worldely goods the
holy ghost makythe hem soft and liberal to give and to de le alms deed
for the love of almighty god and makythe them hard also* in sufferyng of
hard and streyte leuyng and in doing of great penance for her sins. Thus
the holy ghost is ever ready to make salve ^or to hele all manner of sins

That other skylle is why the holy ghost come to the apostles rathir sittyng
thanne stondyng for sittyng be to kenythe meekness in heart with rest piece
and unity the which any m^ner a man must nedis have that woll ^^sceyue the
holy ghost for right ^s the dry wode wolle brenne clearly with onte steryng
so should every christian man love othyr with brennyng love and charity clearly
with out feynyng of wrath or envy or any manner of malice each with other and
every man should be f^yne of other is welfare and this ma^ythe to have a good
tongue. But as soon as the brondes be cast a twynne by desc^nsi^n of malice and
envy a none the fire of the holy ghost quenchith and thanne risithe up smoke
of great wrath and envy between party and party and also great greuaunce and
heaviness for the soul and causithe it to fail grace that it may have no
consideracion to reason than anon the wicked spirits been ready rise and up
smoke in the same man's heart that is for to say great wrath and envy and
evil will that hit may have no manner rest but ever stodyyng and thynkyng also
how he may avenge him and do vengeaunre un to his enemies and so is a man
ever tro^blid and besy in cursid ded is and like to be dampened body and soul
in hell to euerlasty^g p^yne but if he have socoure and help of the holy
gos^e and all soche things that may come of cursid and wicked tongues.

There for the holy ghost comythe in the likeness of tongues of fire to brenne
out the malice and envy and anoynte hem with sweetness of grace love and
charity. And therefore we shall prey to the holy ghost to give us grace so to
tempre our tongues that we may ever more speak good and that our hertys may be
fed with meekness that we may be abyll to be fed with the holy ghost. As
saint Gregor was when he expouned the prophecy he took to him his dekon
seint Petyr to write as he expouned. and made draw between him for petyr
schulde not se how he did in his stodyyngg. Thanne as Gregor satte in his
chair stodyyng holdyng up his hond^^ and his eyes to he uenward the holy ghost
come like a white down with foot and bill brennyng gold and satte on Gregor
right shu^dre and put her bill in Gregoris mouth. and when he with drew
it than he bad Petyr write and so continued till he had made an end. but he
expowned the gospel so boldly that Petyr had marvel there of and preuely
made an hole in the clothe y^ was between gregor and him and saw how the holy
ghost fed him. And a none the holy ghost show de Gr^gor how Petyr had done
Than Eregor blamyd Petyr and chargid him that he should never sey no thing
while he leued. But when gregor was deed an eretike would have bre^ned his
bokys that this holy man made and than Petyr with stood him and seyde nay and
told all how the holy ghost had done to him while he expowned the prophecy
and so sauyd his bokys vnbrennyd that he had made by the grace of god and
yifte of the holy ghost the which give us grace to be fed of him here in
our leuyng that we may have the bliss that never shall have end Amen.

In die s^ncte trinitatis


GOod men and wymmen this day is an high and a solemn feste in holy church
for it is of the holy Trinite For as holy church at wytsontyde makith mention
how the holy ghost come un to cristus disciples Now at this time is made
mention of all iij. pers^nes that is for to say. Pater filiue et spiritus Fadyr
and sone and holy ghost three persons and one god in trinite where for we be
bound to d^^ all the reverence and worship that we can or may to this holy
trinite Also ye shall understand why how and what the cause that this f^ste
was ordained

This holy feste was worshippid for the trinite fedyng for heretics
confoundyng and fore the trinite worshippyng Furste hitwas ordained for the
form of the trinite fyndyng And a great clerk Johan Bellet tellith that form
trinite was in the furste man ada^ onre form fadyr that come of the earth one
person and Eve of Adam the seconnde person of hem both come the iij.
persons as her child.

Thus the trinite was found in man where fore man should have mind to do
worship to the holy trinite. For holy church ordained that in weddyng of
man and woman to gedyr so that the mass of the trynyte is songon. and at his
death one belle shall be ronge in worshipp^ of the Trinite where for all
christian people be bound gretely to worship the holy Trinite. The secounde
cause is that feste is ordained in confoundyng of heretics and of lolleris for
to distroye them and their false opynyones that they had a yenste the holy
trinite fore right as he retikes in the be gynnyg of the feythe with her sweet
words and false opynynes where a boute to distroye the feythe of the holy
Trinite in the same wise lolleris now a days with her false spece of gyle be
a boute also to with draw the people from the true believe and feythe of the
holy trinite and the believe and feythe of holy church (...) marteres and
confessoures to the death Right so now this lolleris pursewithe men of holy church and be a boute in all manner weyes that they can and may find to
distroye and undo hem so that they might have her purpose. And thus they show
opynly that they be not godd is servants for they be out of charity and he
that is out of charity is fer from god but he that suffered tribulacion
persecucion and dissese fore the love of almyty god and prey for his enemies
and wolle not do no vengeance but put all in god almighty and he wolle quyte
hem full well in ever lasting bliss for our lord seyde thus. Michi vindictam
and ego retri^^am Put all thing to me and I shall quyte every man aftyr his
deseruyng for though god suffer holy church to be pursewid by soche mysse
and proud leueris but at the last he ordained soche a remedy that holy
church is holpyn and her enmyes con^undid and shamed. Thus it happid on a time
with the Emperor of Rome that hi ghte Attyl^ and he was made by heretics as
Johan bellet tellith the which Emperor pursewed Christian people sore and hatid
hem and holy church gretely. wherefor he made to do brenne all the bokys that
might be found of christian feythe. But as almighty god would there was a good
holy man and that was a great Clerk and that clerk was callid Alpynyons that
in meytenyng of the feyth of holy church he made the story of the Trynite and
the story also of seinte Stephyn and brought hit un to the pope for to have
hem songon and read in holy church But be counsel of that great clerk they
took the story of Seint stephyn and left the story of the holy Trinite till
to the time that Saint Gregory was pope than for to repreue hem and do hem
shame that be so the mysse beleuyng people and would not believe in the trinite
but made aftyr her reason many he retykes and in consideracion of hem seinte
Gregory the pope ordained this feste to be hallowed and this story to be songon
and radde in holy church in worship of the trinite with all criste^ people
The thride cause is for the high trinite worshippyng and fore all Christian men
should know how and in what manner they should believe in the trinite for as
holy church techithe he that beleuithe in the Trinite shall be saved and they
that does not shall be dampened. Thanne is it full expedyent and needful to
all Christian people to know how they shull leave. ye shall understand that
persite love to god is the believe for he that beleuith persitely makith no
questions that litill a vaylith. Fides non habet meritum vbi humana racio
prebet experimentu^. Feithe has no mede ne merit where man's wit yeuithe
experience. than is it good for all christian people to make love to be mediator
to the holy ghost prayng him to lyghton us with ynne our souls that we may
have grace to come to his persite believe There for this day was set next
with sunday hopyng that the holy ghost woll be ready to all Christian people that
woll call him and specially in lernyng of the feythe but yet for many wyttis
be doulle to learn tha^ they may not se nor here but they be brought in by
great ensample But that people is not most commendable if we may be ensample
come the sonner to the believe in the fadyr and the sone and the holy ghost iij.
persons and all one god take heed of this ensample Of yse snow and watyr how
that these iij. be diverse each in substance and yet is all but watyr. ye may
understand by the watyr the fadir by the yse the sone. and by the snow the
holy ghost watyr is an element that has great might and strength and as the
mastir Alysaundre seythe it is above heaven in the manner of yse like a cristall
and does worship to heaven and anon it is vudir earth and the earth is
grounded upon water And david seythe in the sauter it is all about the world
and in all thing for in hard stones and iron sum time sweet wa^^^ for this
watir is so full of (...)ghte is to understood (...)adir that his power is so
much that he gouernithe all the world. and knowith all thing and all is at
his will and commandment* By the sone Ihesu criste ye shall understood yse
that is water congelid hard and ^^^till that is ihesu criste verray god and
man that took the substance and fraye^te of mankind when he was conceived of
the holy ghost in the virgyn mary and borne of her body god that suffered
passion under pou^ce pilate done upon the cross dyed and was beryed and the
thridde day rose from death to lyffe and aftyr on holy thoursday styed up in
to heaven and shall come a yene at the day of dome and deem the quycke and the
deed. By the snow ye shall vndirstonde the holy ghost for right as snow is
but watir and yse and lihht^ in the air but how no man can tell So comythe the
holy ghost from the fadyr and the fone Spiritua sanctua a patre and filio non
factu^ nec creatu^ nec genitu^ sed proceden^ but how it is for no man to stody
for it excedit all men's wit to stody there upon. but sadly believe the
fadir is full god almighty. and of him come sone fulle god and of hem both
comythe the holy ghost full god. This trinite was known in the fullyng of
criste as the gospel tellithe. In baptismo christi tota trinitas se
manifestanit scilicet pater in ^oce fili^^ in carne spiritu^ sanctu^ in columba
et totum celum apertum erat. Than our lord ihesu criste was baptisid in the
watir of fli^ jordan and all the people nigh of the country there about were
baptized there with him and as they were in her preyoures Et aperti su^t celiet
spiritu^ sanctu^ descendit sicut columba. The holy ghost come down in
likeness of a white dove and lyghtyd on cristus head. Et vo^ de celo dice^^
Hic est fili^^ men^ dilect^^ in qno michi been complacni. And the fadir spoke
in heaven and said Thou art my well beloved sone that plesid me well that was
the holy Trinite that spoke in his person and the sone was there bodily in his
person when Johan baptiste seyde to the people Ecce agn^^ dei. Se the lombe
of god. and the holy ghost was seyne in his person. Sicut columba descendentem
as a white dove come down and these iij. be but one god in trinite wherefore
hit were full needful to all christian people to prey besely so that we may have
grace to have the persite love to believe in the fadir the sone and the holy
ghost three persons and one god^in trinite



we find that the modir of seynte Edmund^ of pounteney as he stody ed of this
holy Trinite she apperyd un to him and leyde in his honde^ iij rings each with
ynne o their. And in the furste was wreton Pater the fadir in the secounde
Filiua the sone and in the thride Spiritua sanctus. the holy ghost and seyde my
dear sone to soche figures take heed and learn what thou may and tak^ good
head to this ensample for right as a ring is round with out any be gynnyng
and endyng right so iij. persons in one god but for to stody how hit might be
it is but folly for hit exdithe any man's wit to mense there upon but saddely
believe there upon



we red of a clerk that was greatly learned in dyuynite the which stodyed
besely to have brought this in a book why god would be believed on god and three
persons and so as he walked on a day stodyyng in this matter by the sea sonde
he was ware of a fair child sittyng on the sea sonde and had a lytill
shelle in his hand and there with he took watyr out of the seeland cast hit
in to a litill pit fast Thanne seyde this mastir to this child sone what
doste y^ and he seyde Sire y am a boute to have all this watyr that is in the sea in to this litill pytte Than seyde this mastyr. that shalt thou never do
hit passithe any man's power. Sire seyde he as sone shall I do this as thou
shalt do that thou art a boute to do and anon the child vanishid a wey
Than this mastir thou ghte it was not goddis will and left his stodyyng in
that matter and thankythe god hyly By this ensample we may se that it is not
godd is will that we should mense in that matter but seedefastly believe in the
fadir the sone and the holy ghost Deni per fidem trinitati^ come by feythe and
love of this persite feythe of the trinite. Deni per opera miseri cordie come
by the werkys of mercy doing Deni per opera insticie come to this believe be
doing of werkys of right wisnesse and thus ye shall come to this per site
believe fadir and sone and holy ghost Et tu^c coronaberia corona glory eterne
And than thou shalt be crow ned with a crown of euerllastyng Joye and bliss
to the which bring us to the holy Trynite Amen

De corpore xp^^
GOod frendis ye shall understood that this das is an high and a solemn
feste in holy church the feste of corpus christi hit is the feste of our
lordis his own body the which is offered to the high fadir of heaven at the
auter in remission of our sins to all criste^ people that leave here in
persite lyffe and charity. and great socoure and help in releuyng hem that be
in peynes of purgatory there a bydyng the mercy of god ye shall understand
that this feste was found by a (...) that was callide v^bane the v* the which
had great grace and devotion in the sacrament in the Autee considering the
great me de help and socoure to man's soul and to the fortheryng of leuyng
to all christian people here in this present world there fore he ordained this
present feste to be hallowed in the next thoursday aftyr the feste of the holy
trinite for all criste^ people that wolle be saved must have ^adde believe in
the holy sacrament that hit is goddis own body in s^^me of bread made by ^^^
virtue of cristus word is that the priest seythe and by worchyng of the holy
ghost Thanne for this holy (...) thought to draw the people to more devotion
and bettir will to this holy sacrament and to do the service this day he
grauntith to all that be worthy that be tho that be verrey contrite and shreuyn
of her sins and be in the church at both euynsonges at matenesse and at
mass for each C. days of pardon and for each our of the day xl. days of
pardon and every day of the v^^s a C. days of pardon in remission of all her
sins for ever more enduryng Thanne ye shall understood that our lord (...)
crist on shereth ours day at night when he had souped and wyste well that
in the morrow that he should suffer passion and death and pass out of this
world vnt^ his fadir in heaven he ordained a perpetual memory of his passion
to a bide for ever with all christian people here in earth He took bread and wine
and made his own flesche and blood and yaue hit to his disciples to ete and to
drink and seyde Accipite et mandu cate hoc est corpna meum Take ye this and
ete hit for hit is mine own flesche and blood and this he deed for they should
have mind of him. And so he yafe to all other prestes power to make his own
body of bread and wine thus every priest has power to make the sacrament be he
good or badde for the sacrament may no man a mende nor a peyre but he that is a
good man and a holy lever helpith greatly tho that he preyith for And he that
does the office of the priest worthily and trewly. shall be glad and joyful
that ever he was borne. For owre lord has euine a priest a yefte and pour
here merth that he yafe neuyr to angelle in heuin that is to make his own body
in form of bread.

There fore e schall have worschipe more in heuyne thene any tongue can tell or
heart think and he that is an evil liffer and know is him self in dedely
sin and presumith to minister that worthi sacrament and woll note a mende
him he may be se were of perpetual damnacion with fyndis of hell in euyr
lasting pain.

Then schall e vndirsta^d that he grauntith this sacrament to be vsid for ever
more in holy church for four causes that be need full to all christian people
The first is for man's great helpyng. The second for cristus passion myndyng
The thridde for great ^one showing. And the fourth for great mede getyng. Nota
anod prop^er noue^ racio^es prodest homini a^dire miss^ secundum Angusti n^
Saint Austyn seith hit profitith greatly all christian people to here mass and in
special for ix. causi^ and seythe thus. Quia illo die qua audierat missam
necessaria cibaria et co^ced u^tur. For that day he herith a mass he shall
fail no bodily fode nor no necessary thing that shall be longyng to him nor
no let shall have in his iorneye where that ever he trauelithe The secounde
is all venial sins shall be for yeuen him and ydull word is The thridde is
if a man dy^ hit shall sconde for his ho sell The fourth he shall not that day
lose his sight The v. all ydull othis y^ day shall be for yeue^ him The vi.
that day he shall not dye no soden death. The vij. as long as he herith that
mass he shall not wex old. The viij. all his steppis toward and fromward the
church his good angel rekenythe to his salvation. The ix. all the while yt he
be holdithe the holy sacramental wikyd spirits fle from him and have no
power over him be he never so great a sinner. This help and so coure we have
of the holy ghost and of the sacrament here in earth and at our last end all
christian people woll send aftyr the priest to come to him with godd is body and
to reseyue hit knowing well that* he beleuyth stedefastly that it is the same
flesche and blood that criste took of our lady sinttmary and was borne of her
body verray god and man and aftyr suffered passion and death on the cross for
all mankind and leyde in tomb* And rose from death to live and now sittithe
on his faderis right hand in heaven and shall come a yene at the day of dome
and deem the quick and the deed every man aftir his deseruyng So this perfect
believe all christian people shall be armed and made strong to withsto^de the
fendes that wol come and a sail at the departing between the body and the
soul for tha^ne fendes come besely to bring him out of the believe. tha^ne
shall the sacrament that a man has resceyued in his lyffe make him mighty and
strong that he shall set all the fendes at naught and so over come hem. A
nothir skyll that the sacrament is brought to a man to ask mercy of criste
and remission of his sins having full trust and believe that criste is ever
ready to for give all them y^ woll ask mercy with ^ meke heart. As David
seythe. Cor contritu^ et bumiliatu^ deus non despicies A contrite heart and a
meke our lord shall never despise and that we may see ensample when he hunge
upon the cross between ij. theuys that were men of cursid leuyng And therefore
they where ordained to be deed and that one askid mercy with a meke heart ad
seyde Domine dum veneria in regnum tumn memento mei Lord quoth he when thon
comyste in to thy kingdom have mind on me and anon at his first askyng he
yaue him mercy and more over he said to him thus Hodie mecum eria in paradiso
This day thou shall be with me in paradise And that othyr theffewolde ask no
mercy in no wise for pride ^ he had in his heart and therefore he was dampened in
to hell. Thus our lord ^hesu criste shed his blood on the cross in health
to all mankind so in the mass every day he shewith his blood in great socour
help and salvation to all mankind and the same flescht and blood is shewid
every day in the mass for we should believe stedefastely there one And he yt
beleuyth not there on verily that it is so shall not be sauid at the day of dome.



Therefore I tell you this ensample that is in the lyffe of wode the bishope of
canterbury this bishop had with him clerkys that beleuyth not perfitly in the
sacrament of the auter and seyde they might not believe that the body and blood
of Criste might be ministret in the mass Thanne was this bishop sorry and
prayde to god besely for her amendment And so on a day when he was at the
mass and had made the fractione he saw the blood drope from the oste in to
the chalyse tha^ he made a sign un to he^ that believed not to come ne^^ him
and to se and wha^ they saw his fingeris blody and the blood ra^ne from the
oste in to the chalisse a none for great fere they cryde and seyde. O thou
blessid man that haste this grace to hold cristus body in thine hondis that
dropped blood in to the chalisse we believe verily there upon and we beseech the
to prey to him for us that thou haste in thy hondis that he take no vengeance
on us* for our missebeleue and we cry mekely mercy And a none the oste
turned in to the form of bread as hit was be fore and tha^ they were perfect
men of believe eueraftir Anothir skille is that the sacrament is made in the
Auter to make a man be oftyn sight there of the sooner to have mind on cristes
passion and to have it in mind for hit is the best defense a yenst tamptacion
of the fend. For seint Austyn seyth the mind of cristus passion puttith awey
all temptaciones and the power of all wickid spiritis And for this cause rodi^
and ymag ^ be set on high in the churches for as soon as a man comythe in to
the church he should se hit and have hit in his myde and think on cristus
passion where for crosses and other images be full necessary and needful. what
sum ever these ^ollers seyne for and hit had not be full profitable holy
faderis would have destroyed hem may yeris a gone. For right as the people do
worshipp^ to the kings seal not for lou^ of the seal but for reverence of the
king that it comythe fro So rodis and images be s^^^e for the kings seal of
heaven and other semtes in the same wise for Images belewde people is ^ok^^ And*
as ^ohan bellet seyth there be many thou sands of people that cannot ymagyn in
her h^^tis how criste was done on the cross but as they* se by images in
chirches and in other places theras they be And to have the betyr mind on
cristus passion I tell you this ensample



There was a christian man of England that went in to the holy lord and hired
an hethyn man to be his gyde and as he come in to a fair foreste and saw many
fair things but this christian man meruelyd gretely that he herd no noise of
byrddus and there of he had great marvel and seyde to this hethyn man I
marvel much that there is no song of byrddus in this wode than seyde this he
thyn man this is the woke that ye call passion woke that your great prophet
dyed y^^^ where for on sunday that last was that ye call palm sunday all the
fowls of this wode dye for sorrow and all this woke shall lie as deed But on
sunday next comyth that ye call Estyr day they quick a yene and all the year
aftyr make melodye. where for look up in to the trees and see and than he saw
every bow of the treeslye full of birdus as fladde as they had be sprede on
the cross Thanne sethe birddus have mind one cristus passion and make ^oche
morning and sorrow mo^h^ more cause has man kind that were boughte from ever
lastyng dampnacion to ever lastyng salvation by his passione

The thridde cause is why the sacrament is vsidin the auter for a man should by
the sight there of think on our lord ihe sulcriste fadyr of heuene that
has but oon sone that he louithe passing all thing but he sparid not to send
him down in to this world to suffer passion and death and to shede his
precious blood for ma^knde to by him out of the fendes bounds and to write a
chartour with his own precious blood of fredome for ever more to all man kind
so that a man forfete not his chartour by dedely sin but he that louithe god
woll keep his chartour for god askithe of a man but love where he seythe thus.
Damichi cor tuum et sufficit michi Sone give me thy heart and hit is y now for
me Thanne take heed of this ensample.



There was an Earl of venys was callid sire Ambryghte that louyd the sacrament
in the aut^r passing well and did hit all the worship and reverence that he
cowde and might. So when that he lay syke and should be deed he might not
resceyue the sacrament forcastyng than was he sorry and made dole and thaune he
let make clean his right side and to cover it with a fair clothe of sendell
and ley god dis body there on And said thus to the oste lord thou knowiste that
I love the with all my here and would feign resteyue the with my mouth and I
durst and therefore that I may notte I ley the on that place that is next to my
heart and so I show the all the love of my heart that I can and may where for
y beseech the good lord have mercy on me an^ even there with in sig^^ of all the
people that ^^^re about him his sydde opened and the Oste went there in to
his sydde And thanne his sydde closed a yene And soo^ none aftyr he did and
departid out of thi^ world So let us love the sacrament in our liffe and do
it reverence and worship and thanne at our last end wha^ we shall dye and
pass out of this world hit will socoure us and bring us to everlasting
bliss. Thus the sacrament is vsid for great mede getyng to all that believe
there ynne. for though it have the likeness of bread and the taste hit is
flesche and semythe bread it is quick and semythe deed ye mo^e believe verily
that it is goddis blessed body that took flesche and blood of the virgyne mary
and after did on the cross and rose from death to live and styed up in to
heaven and now sittithe on his faderis rigthe hand and shall come a yene at the
day of dome to deem the quick and the deed and he that resceyuith it here and
believed verily there upon shall have ever lastyng lyffe in the kingdom of heaven
as the gospel seythe.

Qui manducat hu^c pane^ viuet in eternum. Who so etith of this bread shall
leave ever and never be deed and he that resceyuith hit and beleuith not thus
Renaerit in iudicio at the day of dome he shall be dampened in to ever lastyng
pain. Augustinus in person^ xpristi. Manducas me non mutabis me inte sed ^n
mutabis in me. Seynte Austyn seythe in the person of criste Ete me but y shall
not turn and chance in to the but thou shalt turn and change in to me.



We read that there was a Jew that went wi^h a christian man a fellow of his in

a child soch as the priest ete. yet to sharp your be leave the more to this
holy sacrament I woll tell you this ensample



We read in seynte Gregorius time there was a woman that highte laciua and she
made bread for the pope and othyr prestys to singe with and for to hosell with
the people Also when the pope come to this woman to give her hosell and seyde
take here goddis body than this woman smylid and laughed thanne the pope with
drew his ho^de and leyde the oste upon the auter and turned to this woman
laciua and seyde to her whismylest thou when thou shuldeste resceyue cristus

verray god and man and goddis sone of heaven in form of bread. Thanne badde
Gregor the people prey a yen that hit should turn a yene to bredis likeness
and so hit deed and with the same oste he hoselid this woman lacina and therefore
late us do all the worshipp^ that we may to the sacrament that we can or may

Also we find that in deuynchere be side exbrigge was a woman lay sike and was

than this man in all the haste that he might he a rose and went to church
and took goddis body in A box of yuery and put hit in to his bosom and went

that was his next wey it happid that his box fill out of his bosom to the
ground and he went forth and woste hit not and come to this woman and herd

De festo sancti andree apostoli.


GOod men and wymme^ ^och a day ye sha^ have seint Andrewis day and ye shall
fast the euene and come to god and to holy church and worship this holy
seynte that day for three special vertous One is for his great holiness in his
ded doing. The secounde for his good leuyng. The threde for his great
compassion sufferyng. He was a man of holy leuyng for when he understood and
herd of seint Johan the baptist that he was prechyng in deserte anon he left
all his wordely occupacion and went to him and was his disciple. And so after
on a day as crist come walkyng by the way and seint Johan baptiste saw him
walkyng he seyde to his diseiples. Ecce agnus dei qui tollit peccata mu^di See
the lombe of god that shall do a way the sin of all the world. And when
seint Andrew he^de that anon he left seint Johan baptiste and sewid forth
criste

And when he herd criste preche hit plesid him so well that a none he went
and fette Petyr his brother to here criste preche than they cast great love to
god and sone after as they where in the sea of galyle fischyng crist come and
called hem and a none they left fischyng ship and net and all that they
had and sewid crist ever after and where with him till he styed up to heuene.



Thanne after that seint Andrew prechid a mong the people than on a day as he
prechid it happened so there was a man among the people that was called Nicoll
that had leuyd many wynters in lechery but yet by the g^^ce of god he
thought to amend his lyffe and when he herd that the word of god was of so
great virtue that hit should put a way all temptacions of sin he let write
a gospel and bare hit with him where some ever he went and with the virtue
there of he absteyned him self from sin. But yet on a day by temptacione of
the fend he for gate him self and went ayene to a brothellus house as he was
used to do be fore and when he come thedyr and when the wymen lokyd up on him
they cried out on him and said o thou old sely man what doste thou here go
home ayene for we see so many marvelous on the that we may not have to do with
the. Thanne this Nicoll be thought him that he had the gospel upon him and a
none he went to seint andrew and told him all the cause and preyde seint
andrew to prey for him that his soul might be sauyd. Thanne seint andrew
would never etene drink till he wyste whethir Nicoll should be sauyd or no
Thanne seint andrew fastyd.v. days bread and watyr and preyde besely night and
day. Thanne come a voice and said as thou haste fast and preyde make Nicoll to
do the same and thanne he shall be saved. Than seint andrew bad Nicoll fast.v.
days bread and water and prey besely unto god and so he deed and thanne come a
voice to seint andrew ayene and said thy preyours and thy fasting has made
Nicoll that was lost found ayene and he shall be sau^d.



Also anothir miracle that anothir young man come to seint andrew in a time and
said preuely to him sire my modyr has be long about me that I should lie
with her and for I would not do her will she has acused me to the bishope and
said that I would have done that sinful ded with her where for I wotte well
that I shall be deed and yet I had lever dye than sclandyr my modyr so soul
There for I beseech you prey for me that y may take my death patiently to the
salvation of my soul Thanne said seint Andrew goo forth to thy dome and I
shall goo with. and so there with the people come and set him be fore the
bishop And when his modyr accufid him he said no thing but held his pese
Than said seint Andrew.

Innocena sangnia eiua sine causa dam nabit. This cursed woman for lust of her
body wrongfully is about to dampne her own child to death vengeance woll
come to the. Thanne said she lo sire justice ever sethe he might not have his
will he has drawyn unto this man for counsel and socour Thanne the justice
comaundid to cast this youg man in to the watyr to drown him and to put
seint andrew in prison till he where a vysid what death he should dye. Thanne
seint andrew preyde besely unto god for help and socour and thanne a none come
a great thoundyr and made all the people so a ferde that they where feign to
set seint Andrew out of the prison. And even there with come a lyghtnyng of
fure and brennyd the modyr of the young man in sight of all the people. And thus
was this man sauyd and the justice by this great miracle turned to christian
feyth and much other people with him and ever after believed in god and seint
Andrew there by ye may see that he was holy in leuyng.

Also he was great in miracles worchyng for on a day as he went by the sea
side he saw a drowned man cast out of the watyr than andrew preyde to god to
rere him ayene to lyffe and anon this man rose Than andrew asked him where
that he was drowned. and he seyde we where.x. men to gedyr and herd of an
holy man that hight Andrew And we where coming to here his prechyng and as we
where in the sea there come a great tempest and drowned us all to gedyr but
would god that we had be cast to land to gedyr that we might have been
raised to lyffe to gedyr ayene. Thanne anon seint androwe preyde to god that
all the bodies might come to gedyr and so they deed. and where raste up in
diverse countres Than seint andrew made and ordained to gedere hem all to
gedyr. Than he knelyd down and preyed god long for them till they where
raised all to lyffe. Than seint andrew made hem all to knele down and thank
god and preached hem and taught hem christian feythe and cristened hem all and
when they where stedefaste in the feythe he sent hem home to their own
country with much joy to hem and many other miracles he ded that where to
long to tell thus ye may se that he was mighty in miracles worchyng that
raised so many men to lyffe Also he suffered great passione for criste sa^ke
for when he was in the cite of pateas there he turned to the feyth the wife of
Egeas. And this Egeas was a great man and made much people to do sacrifice and
ofringes to maumentys but for seint andrew repreuyd him there of anon he made
to take him and would have made him to do sacrifice but he would not and
stedefastly ayenstode him and preuyd be many ensamples be cause that he and all
the people should worshipe god and not the fendis of hell Thanne was egeas wode
for wroth and made men to take andrew and stripe him nakyd and beat him with
storges that all his body ran on blood and thanne made to bind him hand and
foot and made do him on a cross for he should pain there on long or he died
but when andrewe come to the place there the cross was he knelid down and
said thus. Salve cr^x que in corpore christi dedicata e^. Holy be thou xrosse
that art hallowed and made holy by the precious body of our lord ihesu
christ I desire to clippe the to me where for take me to the for I yield me
unto my mastyr ihesu criste that dyed on the cross And than andrew stood up
and ded of his clothis and yaue hem to the tourmentoures and bad hem do as they
where chargid to do of the justice Thanne they bound him to the cross hand
and foot and his head downewardes and streyued him so that the blood barste
out at every knotte of the ropes and so he honge there.iij. days a live
prechyng the people and so there come to the prechyng many thowsandes of people
and for pite that they had of him they bad Egeas take him down or they would
sle him. Thanne for fere of the people egeas come to take him down Than seint
Andrew ayenstode him and said Quid tu venisti adme egeas what comist thou to me
Egeas wete thou well thou shalt have no might to take me down for on this
cross woll I dye And even there with. Hiis enim dicti^ splendour nimis circuiens
eum quasi per media^ horam. a great light come a boute him that there no man
might se him in space of half an our and more Thanne said seint Andrew.
Obsecro tedn^e miserere mei. I be seche the lord have mercy on me and so in
that light he yafe up the ghost. And thanne when egeas saw and know this that
he was deed he went homeward than after that day he waxyd wode and sone after
he dyed among all people And when maximilla his wyffe herd there of a none she
took andrewys body and buried it in a tomb. and out of the tomb wellyd manna
and oil to gedyr and by that people of the Country know when hit should be
dear and when great plente For when it shall be cheppre hit wellyth plentyfully
and when it shall be derthe sharsely.



Hit fell so there was a bishop that louyd well seint andrew and for the find
might in no wise bring him out of his purpose he come to the bishop in
likeness of a feyr woman preyng him that she myt speak with him in counsel of
confession And he granted there to Sire said she y am a knights daughter and
have be much cherished and norishid in great tenderness and for I see this
world is but a vanite to trust upon y have avowed chastity and now my fadyr
would mary me to a worthy prince and for I would not brecke my vow y am come
preuely a wey in pore array and thus y herd of your great holiness and am come
to have your council and socour and help of you. wherefore I pray you that ye
ordeyn for me that the fend have no power to let me of my porpose Thanne the
bishop comforted her and bad that she should thancke god that had set her
in such porpose and that he would send her grace there with to co^tynue And
seyde to her Esto secura filia. Be thou sekyr daughter this day thou shalt
dyne with me and thanne we shall by good auyse when we have dyned ordeyn so for
you that ye shall do right well Nay sir said she left the people would have any
suspessione of badde reule ye said the bishop there of no charge Plurima erimus
and non soli. For there shall be so many in company that there shell be none
suspessione Thanne sho thankyd him feyre and scho was set to for the bishop
in a chayr at mete And ever when the bishop lokyd on her he semyd her so
fair that he was greatly temptyd on her so that he had all most foryete him
self. And thanne anon there come a pilgryme to the gate and beat fast on the
gate that all that were in the halle were sore a stonyd of the noise so he
cried let in let in Thanne seyde the bishop shall this man come ynne.
Tha^ne said sho late him answer to sum questione first whethir he be worthy
or no to comesonye in presence. Thanne seyde the bishop I pray you makeye the
question for I am not a vysid at this time Thanne said sho to the massenger In
terroga quod e^ magis miraculu^ quod deus vmqua^ in parua re fecit Ask him
what was the grettyste miracle that ever god made in a foot of earth. Thanne
when the pilgreme was asked this he answered and said a mannys face the which
is but foot and but a mannys own face For thou all the me^ and wymmen that
ever where borne stood a fore me ytte should y know one from a nothir be some
degree. when he yafe this answer he was greatly co^mendid therefore Than said she
I se that he is wise. bid him yefe a nothir answer to anothir question Ask
him whethir earth is he yer or heuyn Than he answered and said thus There as
cristys body is there is earth for cristys body is of our kind and our kind is
earth. there fore there as cristis body is earth is heyer than heuyn. when he had
yeuyn that answer he was well a lowed and was beden come in Nay said she late
him a soil the third question Ask him how far it is fro heuyn to hell than
when he was oposid of this he answerde the messengere Goo again to her that
sets in the chair be fore the bishop and bydde her give this answer for
she can better than I. Quando de celo in abissum ^ecidit For she is a fend and
has metyn hit and so did I never She fill down with lucifer And when the
messengere herd this he was all heavy but he yafe this answer that all men
might here. Than this fend vanished away with an horrible stink Than the
bishop bethout him of his temptacion and was sorry in his heart and anon he made
to send after this pilgryme but be that the messenger come ayene to the gate he
was gone. Than the bishope made all men to pray to god to send wetyng what the
pilgryme was y^ so goodly halpe him at his need Than come there a voice to him

Festum sancti nicolai.


GOod men and wymmen soch a day ye shall have seint nicolas day the which is
much preysed in holy church and specially for three causis. the furste for
his meke leuyng The secounde for his heavenly techi^^ The third for his great
compassion having Furste he was made lowly Pater eius epiphanus matter eius
iohana dicta est. Hit is said that his ^adyr highte epiphanus and his modyr
ione the which in their thought goto seint nicolas And when he was borne they
made her ^owes both to keep and to leave in chastity and no more come to gedyr
but hold hem plesid of this one child that god had sent hem the which they
made him christian and called him Nicolas that is a maunes name but he kepith the
name of the child for he chose to keep virtuous meekness and simpleness and
with out malice. Also we read while he lay in his cradyll he fastyd we^^nysday
and freyday these days he would soke but ones of the day and therewith held him
plesid Thus he leuyd all his live in virtuous with this child is name And there
fore children done him worship be fore all othyr feintys for he was ever
meke with out any malice so that all people preysed him for his meke leuyng
here. Also he was bishop of the cite of mirre by the which that come from
heuyn. For when the bishop was deed all the bishops of the country come to
gedyr to chese anothir than ne come a voice to on of hem and bad him rise erly
in the morrow and go to the church door and make him bishop that ye find
there that is callid Nicolas And so on the morrow he come to the church door
and there he found Nicolas And than he said thus to him Quale nome^ habeatu
what is thy name. Inclito capite And lowtyng with his head answered mekely and
said Nicolas thanne said the bishop Fili ^eni mecum. Sone come with me for I
have to specke with the in counsel and so ladde him to the other bishops and
said lo seris here is he that god has ordained to be. And so they made him
bishop of mirre by heavenly chesyng. He had also a great compassione of tho
that where in dissese and parell for when his fadyr and his modir dyed they
left him wordely good y now the which that he spente on the^ that where pore
and nedy.



Hit fell so that there was a rich man that had iij. fair daughters young
wymmen but by mishefe he fell in to pourte so that for great need he ordained
his eldyste daughter for to be a common woman. And so after the tothir to
daughters for he might not find hem And so by this mean got his leuyng and
heris both for he woste not how to leave for the great pouerte that he stood
ynne And when Nicolas herd there of he had great compassione of hem all and
come preuely in a night to this man's house and at a wyndow he cast a b^gge
of gold in to this man's chanbre. and on the morrow when this man ^ose and
found this gold a none there with he married his eldeste daughter Thanne come
nicolas and brought anothir sone after and there with he married the secounde
daughter Thanne this man had great marvel how this gold come the their and
wakyd preuely to know there of a^^ the thridde time Nicolas come and this man
herd the gold fall anon he went out and ouertoke Nicolas and when he know
that hit was he that had helped him so in his need he knelid down and would
have kyssid his fete but he would not suffer hit but prayed him to keep
counsel while he leuyd.



Also anothir time men where in the sea like to be drowned in a great tempest
they cried to god and seint nicolas seeing thus Domine rex eterne succurre nobis
misery. Lord king ever lastyng socour us wrechis and anon nicolas come and
said. Docasti^ me ecce assum presena ^o I am present at your calling and so
brought hem forth save and sound to land.



Also there was in the count^^ in a time great derthe of corn Fame^ valida and
great hounger in so much that the people where all most lost for the fault
of mete Thanne hit hapenyd there come ships of the Emperors frayghte in to an
hauyn with whete in that country. Thanne went seint Nicolas to hem and preyde
hem that he might have of every ship a.C. bushelles of her whete for to
releue the people with And he would vndyr take that they should lake none of her
met when they come home thanne he had all his askyng and when the ships
come to the emperor they had her full mesure and lackyd no thing of her
corn that seint nicolas had thorough his holy preyour Oquam probat sanctum
dei farris augmentacio. O how meruelously be grace of god and preyour of this
holy man this whete was multiplied and encresyd for of that whete was so great
plente that hit found all the people to ete and drink and sowgh y now three
year after.



Anothir miracle there where.ij. knights that where accused of treson to the
emperor of a false matter and where commanded to preson for to have been put
to death sone after Thanne they cryde to god and to seint nicolas for help and
socour so that the night before that they should be deed seint nicolas come to
the Emperor as he lay in his bed and said thus to him why haste so
wrongfully dampened these knights to death a rise up anon and dely uer hem
o^te of preson anon or else y woll prey to god to reyse batell up on the in
the which thou shall dye and wild bestys shall ete the. Than said the
Emperor to him what art thou that so boldly spekyth and so thretenyste me
Thanne said he y am nicolas the bishop of mirre than the Empero(...) sent
after the knyg^^^s and ^^yde to hem what wyche craft can ye that thus has
traueled me to night know ye any man that hyghte Nicolas bishope of mirre
Thanne as soon as they herd this name they fell down to the ground and held
up her handys thankyng god and seint Nicolas. when they had told the
Emperor of his lyffe and how holy he was the Emperor ba^ hem go to him and
than ke hem of her lyffe and so they deed and he prey de the knights to prey
Nicolas to thretyn the Emperor no more but prey to god for him and for his
reame and so they deed. Thus ye may see that he has great compassion of him
that where in dissese. Thanne after when seint Nicolas should dye he preyde to
god to send him an An gell to fette his soul. And when he saw this angel
come seint Nicolas lowted and said. In manua tu^^ domint commendo spi ritum
meum redemisti me domine dt no veritatis. And so he yield up the ghost. and
when he was bery^d at the he de of his tom be sprange a well of oil that deed
medicyns to all sores Thanne hit hap pyd many yeris after that turkys distroyed
the cite of mirre there as sein te nicolas lay and when the people of the cite
of Barus herd that the eite of mirre was distroyed. xlvij. knights where
ordeynd to go the dyr than they arayde shippis and went the thyr and be
tellyng of four monks that where left there they knew seint nicolas tomb and
vndede hit a none and there they found seint Nicolas bones swimming in oil
than they took hem up and brought hem to the cite of Barus with great
solempnite. Thanne for great miracles that where ^roughte there in the cite of
mirre encrefid ^yene And so after seint nicolas was deed they chose anothir
bishop in his stead and anon after by enmyte of the people he was put
down from his bishopriche and than anon the oil sesyd and ran no more.
Thanne was the bishop called ayene to hi(...) than the oil sprang^oute ayene
as hit deed to fore and deed many miracles.



There was a criston man borrowed a certain some of money of a jew and the Jew
said he would lene none but he had a borow. and this christian man said he had
none but seint nicolas and he granted to take seint nicolas to borow Than this
christian man s^ore up on the auter that he would well and trewly pay this money
ayeny and so departed and went her wey till day of payment come and when
this day was passyd than the i^we asked his money and this christian man seyde
that he had paid him and the jew seyde nay he had not. and that other
seyde he had and that he would do his law and swear up on a book And so
when the day come that they should go to the law the christian man made him an
holowe staff and put the gold there in and so come to the law. And when he
should swear while he went to the bo lie he took the Jew his staff there the
gold was ynne to hold. And by this mean swore he had paid the jew and when
he had sworn he took his staff of the jew a yene and went homewardes And
as he wen te by the wey he was pas sing slepy and he leyde him down to sleep
in the high weye Thanne hit happened there come a carte rennyng and went over
this man and slew him and brake his staff that the gold was ynne and the
gold fylle out. Thanne the people saw that this come of great vengeance for
the falshede that he had done And they fette the jew and bad him take up his
money. Thanne was the jew sorry and said he would not but if that they would
prey seinte nicolas to rere him ayene than he would be christian. ^eleuauit a
defuncti^ defunctum.

Thanne this deed man was reryd from death to lyffe by the preyour of seint
nicolas Baptisator auri viso indeus indicio Thanne this i^we that was out of
the believe by the fight of this miracle he was cristened.



Also there was anothyr jew that saw the great might of seint Nicolas in
miracles worthyng and he let make an image of seint Nicolas and set it in
his ship to keep his good and chargyd the image to keep well his good while
he was absent and when this man was gone there come theuys of the sea and
robbed this man and bare a wey his good And when this Jew come home ayene
and saw all his good gone he was full wroth with seint Nicolas and took a
staff and all to beat this image and seyde. Ecce omnia bo na mea posui in
veltra custodia Ioqd he I took all my good to your keeping for great trust and
hit is stole a wey ye have disseued me and there for thou shalt a bye every
day till y have my good ayene. Tha^ as these thieves departed the good seint
Nicolas come to hem and said Cur tam direct fe cistia me flagellari why have
ye made me be betyn thus sore Than they said Quia eatn what art thou that
spe^yste thus to us Than he said Ego sum Nicolaua seruua dei. I am Nicolas the
servant of god that ye have made thus sore be betyn and shewde hem how sore he
was betyn for the good that they had bor ne a wey that was taken him to keep
and he bad de hem goo and bear this good ayene a none or else goddys
vengeance shall fall one you and ye shall be hongyd in hell euerichone. Than
they were sore a ferde and bare ayene the good that same night And one the
morrow when the Jew come and saw his good brought ayene anon he was
cristenyd and after that he was an holy man And every year after on seinte
Nicolas day for the great love that he had to seint Niclas and alse of a sone
that he had de that was a clerk he made a great feste on seint Nicolas day
thanne hit happed on a time up one a seynte Nicolas day he badde many clerc^ys
to his feste Thanne come the find to the gate in ly kenesse of a pilgreme and
a shyd sum good for goddys sake. Thanne the good man that made the feste took
his sone elmesse to bear the pelgre me so the child went to the gate thanne
was the pelgreme gone And the child followed after the fend. And when he was
a good wey from his fadyris place the fend caughte the child and slew hit
And when the fadyr herd there of he was full sorry and took the child and
leyde hit in his chamber and tryde for sorrow and said a seint Nicolas is this
the reward and mede that I shall have for the great worship that I do to the
and anon the child rose from death to lyffe than this man was full glad and
thankyd god and seynte Nicolas.



Anothir miracle there was a man that preyde to god and to seint Nicolas that he
might have a child and if he had a child he would led hit to the church of
seynte Nicolas and there he would offer up a couppe of gold and than sone
after he had a child. And when this child was of reasonable age his fadyr
deed do make a couppe of gold And when hit was made hit likyd him so well
that he let make anothir and thanne he went toward seint Nicolas church
and he must pass over the sea. So when they were in the sea the fadyr badde
the sone take up some water with the couppe. And than the child would have
caught water and the couppe fill out of his hand in to the sea And than the
child would have caught the couppe ayene and fill after in to the sea and so
the child was drowned there in the sea. Thanne the fadyr made much sorrow but
yet he went forth with y^ other couppe to do his pilgremage And when he come
to seint Nicolas church and offerid up his couppe and set it on the Auter
anon hit was cast from the auter and he set hit ayene and hit was cast
ferther and yet the thride time he set te hit ayene and thanne hit was cast
much ferther Thanne come the child with y^ other couppe in his hand and said
to all the people that seint nicolas took him up by the hand when he fill in
to the sea and latte him save out. Thanne was the fadyr glad and of fered up
there both coupes and went home a yene with great joy and myrthe.



There was anothyr rich man that be preyores of seint Nicolas had a child
and he made a feyre chapel in worship of god and seint Nicolas. So hit
happed on a day this child was takyn wi^h enemies and ladde in to anothir
straynge country and there he was in service in the kings court And as it
happed on a seint Nicolas day he be thought him of the great myrthe and
solempnite that was made that day in his fadres chapel at home and he was heavy
and sikyd wounder sore. Thanne the hyng herd there of Thanne said the king
Nicolas what meneste thou to sight so sore be merry for thou must nedys a bide
here with us And anon there come a great wind and smote the house and braste
hit And the child was caughte up with the cup that he bare in his hand and
was set be fore the gate of the Chapel there as his fadyr made his feste.
Thanne was there made great joy and myrthe of this miracle. To thus ye may see
how great compassione that seint Nicolas had of hem that where in misheue and
dissese sum bokys say y^ this child was of Normandy and was takyn with a
sowdon be yonde the sea and often he was betyn. And ones when he was betyn up on
a seint Nicolas day and put in to preson than he wept sore And with that he
fell on sleep And when he woke he was in the church of his fadres.

De concepcione heat marie virginie.
Ood men and wymmen soche a day ye shall have the concepcion of our lady the
which day and feste holy church makythe mind and mention of the concepcion
of our lady for three special causes The first is for her fadres ho^lynesse
The secounde for her modres goodness And the thride for her meekness She
had a fadyr that was called Ioachym that was so holy a man that when he
was but.xv. winter of age he deparryth all his good in to three parties. And one
part he delyd to wedowes and to fadyrles children The secounde part he gave
to them that where pore and nedy. The thryde part he kepithe to him self and
his household And wha^ he was.xxxij. winter of age for the great goodness of
Anne he wedded her And when they where wedded they where to gedyr.xxij. year
in the which time Anne never displesed him with no manner thing nothir night
nothir day. For she was so gentle to him for they where both good and holy
yet god sent hem no fruit of her bodies but where bareyne. where fore they
made a vow to god that if he would send hem a child they would offered un to
him up to the temple for to serve god both night and day.

Thanne on a day as Ioachym went with his neyborus to the temple to do his
offerynges The bishop that highte Isachar whukyd him openly before all the
people and said Ioachym hit fallyth not for the that art bareyne and haste no
fruit to do offe rings with other people that god has sent fruit in
Jherusalem Than was Ioachym sore dysmayed and distonyed with this rebuke Than
he went home weeping and took his schepard preuely with his schepe and went
forth into a far country a mongt mounteynes and hyllis and purposid to have
be there all his lyffe and never more to come home to Anne his wyffe Thanne
when ioachym was gone Anne was sorry and preyde to god and said lord that me is
woo that I am bareyne and may have no fruit and now more my husbonde is gone
from me I wot not whethir he is be come lord have mercy on me. Thanne as she
preyde thus an angel come down and comforted her and seyde anne be of good
comfort for thou shall have a child in thine old age there was never none
like ne never shall be. Thanne was anne a ferde of this Angellys his word is
and of the ^ighte of him and lay all wey in her preyoures as she had be deed.
Thanne went the same Angel to Ioachym and seyde these same words and badde
Ioachym take a lamb and offyr hit in sacrifice to god and so he deed and
when he had done so from mydday till euensonge time he lay on the ground
in his preyoures thankyng god with all his heart. Thanne on the morrow as the
angel bad he went homewarde to Anne his wyffe with his sheep And when he
come nyghe home the Angel come to Anne and bad her goo to the gate that was
called the goldyn gate and a bide her husbonde there till he come. Thanne was
she glad and took her meydenes with her and went to the gate and there
schemette with ioachym and said lord I thank the for I was a wedowe and now
am a wyffe I was bareyne and now y shall have a child y was woo and weeping
and now y shall be in joy lykyng And sone after anne conseyued our lady And
when she was borne she was called mary as the angel badde be fore.

Than after that she was wenyd she was brought to the temple and left there
among other virgenys to serve god both night and day. Than was she so meke
among all other virgenys in all her leuyng that all virgenys cally^ her queen
of virgenys So she is the mekyste of all the seintes that be ^^ heaven and most
redye^^ to help all them that callith to her in any need.



we read in holy write a miracle of our lady.

There was a lordys man that had gaderyd much good of his lordys for he was
his rent gaderar and went to be re hit to his lord Than was there theses that
set for him to rob him by the weye in the wood there as he must nedys goo
thourghe So when he come in to the wode he be thought him that he had not
seyde our lady sauter as he was wont to do And he knelyd down and began to
sey. Thanne come our lady like a fair madyne and set a garlounde on his
head and at each aue she set a rose in the garlounde that was so bryghte that
all the wood shone there of and when he had done he kyssed the earth and
went his wey. Thanne come the theses and took him and led him to her maistre
the which had seyen all these doings than seyde he to him what woman was that
that set the garlaunde on thine head and he said ^irre for so the y sye no
woman ne garlaunde Than said these master these y wot well thou art a lordys
man and haste much good with the but y would feign wete what woman that hit
was that come to the and why thou knelyst down and he said when y sigh you y
was a ferde and also y be thought me that y had not said our lady sauter and
knelyd down to sey it preyng our lady to help me at my need than said he for
her love goo thy wey and prey to her for us and so he went his wey safe and
sound be help and socour of our dear lady.

But now ye shall here how this feste was first found. There was a king in
England that highte wyllyam conqueror he sent the abbot of ramsey to the king
of denemarke on his message and when he come in to the sea there come a
derkenes and a tempest that he and all that where with him went to have be
drowned. And every man preyde besyly to god and to our lady for socour and
help and other diverse seynt^s and this abbot preyde to god and to our lady
full deuotely Than come to hem a fair woman and said to them if ye woll have
the contepcione of our lady in worship that is.ij. days after seint nicolas
day she woll be ready to help and socour you at this time and than this abbot
said ye with good will and y woste what should be the service of the feste.
Thanne said she the same that is in the Natiuite safe turn the natiuite in to
the concepcion And the abbot seyde hit should be done with full good will. than
anon the tempest ^^ssed and all was well and they saylid forth and the Abbot
deed his message and come ayene safe and sound and spedde well in every degree.
And when he come home he told the king this vision the king made him preche it
in all the reame about

And thus hit was a lowed in all holy church.



Also we find that there was a seculer chanon that one a time went over a
water to have done a vowtrey with a woman And as he was a boute to be gynne to
sey our lady matenes and as he was at the inuitatory that is Aue maria there
with the fend cast him down and drowned him and would have had him to
hell. thanne come our lady and said why haste thou take this man the fend
said for we find him in our service going to do a vowtrey. tha^ said our
lady he was in my service and anon restorid him to lyffe again and bad him do
no more sin And bad him to halowe also her concepcion so he deed and was a
good man ever after all his lyffe.



Also there was a clerk that every day used to sey the service of our lady
thanne hit happid be council of his frendis he should have a wyffe and when
he should be wedded he be thought him that he had not said our lady
service. Than he made all the people to goo out of the church while he said
his service And thanne he knelyd a down and said his service till he come to
an antem of our lady Quam pulchra es amica mea. Thanne our lady aperyd un to
him and said why sayste thou that I am fair and honest why wit thou than
leave me and take anothir Thanne said he on to our lady what wolte thou that I
shall do thanne said our lady if thou wolte leave thy fleschely wyffe and serve
my sone and me I shall be thy spouse and thou shalt have with me a crown of
ever lastyng lyffe in the kingdom of ever ^astyng bliss the which god and
his blessed modyr saint mary and all holy seintys in heuene bring us all
thethir now and ever Amen.

Sequitur sermo breuis de sa^cto thoma apostolo.


GOod men and wymmen soche a day ye shall have saint thomas day that was
cristys apostell and ye shall fast the euyne and do him worship specially
for three causes The first for the preuyng of our believe And for great
wounderes in his wey And great miracles in his day. This holy apostell preued
so our feythe that he left no troble for when the disciples said that our
lord was resyn from death to live and they had seyne him and spoke with him
Thomas said he would not believe it till he had put his hand in to his side
in to the wound that the spear had made. Thanne.viij. days after when all
the disciples were to gedyr and Thomas wi^h hem Thanne our lord ihesu criste
come bodily to hem and seyde Par vobis Pees be with you and thanne our lord
said to Thomas of ynde. Mitte manum tuam in latus meum Put thy hand in to my
side in to the wound that was made with the spear that smote me to the heart.
Et noli esse incredulus. And be no longer out of the believe but be stead fast
in the feythe Thanne when thomas had do so a none he cried and seyde for
great woundre. Dominua meus et deus meus. my lord my god I believe that thou
art verry god and man.

Thanne our lord said to him Beatiqui crediderunt et non viderunt. blessed be
tho that believe and se not. for now thou haste seyn thou beleuiste but yet the
taryng of Thomas brought us to sadder believe and to the blessyng of our lord
ihesu criste Of this spekyth seynte Gregori and seyth thomas of ynde thou haste
help more to the feythe that woldeste not believe till thou haddiste felyd his
wound thanne did mary mawdeleyne that did believe at first sight M^nus est
enim in maria magdalene que cicius credidit quam Thomas qui diu dubitauit Thus
Thonas preued our feythe and our believe that we nedyd never to vary nor be in
dowte. Also thomas did many meruallys and great wounderys that were in his
days.



Hit happid that a king of ynde send his messenger Abbanus. In die requirens
artificium to seek sum crafty man in to the country of caesar to seek a
carpenter that could make him a palyse to his plesaunce Thanne our lord ihesu
criste mete with this abbanus and sent him to Thomas in to ynde also when
thomas and Abbanus were passed the sea they come in to a cite there as the
kings daughter was weddid the same day where fore all manner of people were
commaundid to mete so among other people thomas and abbanus come ynne and where
set to mete but thomas ete not for his thoghte was ever of god and had no
lust to ete Thanne come a botelere to thomas and smote thomas on the cheke and
bad him ete than said Thomas to him Non hunt surgam donec manus qui me
percussit a ^anibus affertur. I shall not rise from this place till that hand
that smote me be brought in with a dog Thanne anon after the Boteler went
after water and a lion met with him and flew him and drancke his blood and
ete of his body and than come a blake dog and caughde that hand that smote
thomas and brought hit in to the halle in the sight of all the people and
leyde hit down before thomas than was there a woman that understood thomas
wordis and anon knelyd down to thomas and cryde and said thou art god or
else on of his disciples for right as thou wolte so hit is thanne the king
preyde to thomas to bless his daughter and her husbonde. than thomas was
glad there of. Cepit ergo predicare beatus thomas. therefore the blessed thomas
be ganne to preche and told hem of our ihesu criste that he turned the man
that was weddyd the same day from his wyffe and made him bishop of the same
cite and his wyffe a nonne and they were marterys after for cristys sake Thanne
went thomas forth in to ynde to the king to make him a paleyse to his
plesaunce so when thomas was come to the king he was glad and delyueryd
Thomas a great sum of gold to make a paleyse with. than rode the king forth
in the mean time And so when thomas should have made this paleyse him thought
hit was better to make a paleyse in heaven than in er^h and delyd his gold a
mong pore people and co^uertyd hem to the feyth Thanne come the king home and
went that his paleyse had be ready made And when he herd how Thomas and
Abbanus had done he would have put hem to death but hit happid that his
own brothir was deed the same time and therefore he put hem both in prison
in to the time that he had beryed his brothir Thanne as god would when his
brothir had long lay deed he rose from death to life and told the king that he
had seyne his paleyse in paradyse that thomas had made for him and preyde the
king that he might have hit and he would give him as much gold as he took
thomas Thanne the king took his counsel and said nay I w^ll have it my self
let him make the anothir for his brothir had seyne this paleyce in paradyse
made with gold and ^rayed with precious stones and clothe of gold. Thanne the
king took cristendome and many a thousend with him and when the bishops saw
that the king and so much other people for soke her lawus and turned to
cristondome they where so wroth with thomas that one of them seyde he would
venge his god and with a spear smote thomes thourghe the body and slew him
Than christian people beryed him in a tomb of cristall and there god wot
wroughte many miracles for him For the hand that was in cristys side would
never come in to the tomb but ever lay with out Also in his techyng and
prechyng he taught Duodecim gdua virtutum assignare Primua est vt in deum
crederent ^ui est vnua in essencia et trinua in personi^. Dedit eis triplex
exemplum se^sibile quomodo sint indiuidencia vna* tre^ person* Primum est quia
vna e^ in homine sa^ie^cia et de vna procedit intellectus. memoria et ingenium
memoria est vt non obliuiscaria in tellecto. vt intelligas que ostendi possunt
vel doceri ingenium est vt quod didiceri^ inuenias Secundum est quia in vna
vinea tria sunt lignum folium et fructus. Et her omnia tria sunt vinea. Tercium
est quia caput nostrum ex quatuor sencibu^ constat In vno autem capite sunt
Disu^ a^ditua adoratu^ et gustus et hec plurasunt et tame^ vnum caput. Secundus
gradua est vt baptismum suscipiat. Terciu^ gradus e^ vt a fornicacione
abstineat. Quartu^ vt se ab auaricia teperet. Quintua vt gulam distringeret.
Sertu^ vt penit^ciam teneret Septimus vt in hiis perseuerarent Ocrauns vt
hospita litate^ amarent. Nonus vt volu^tate^ dei requira^t Decimu^ est vt
facienda quererent Vndecimu^ vt caritate^ amicia et innimici^ impendere^t
Duodecimu^ est vt custodia^thiia vigile^ curam exhiherent Item apostalus Omnea
qui oderant deum de tribus breuiter instruxit scilicet vt ecclesiam diligerent
Sacerdotes honora rent Et assidue adverhum dei conuenirent. Also there be many
marvelous and wondre full things done on this day for on that day all the
country comythe the dyr to take pardone of that hand that lythe out of the
tomb in the use of the bishop of the cite that gothe to mass. And when he
has said Confite or thanne he takyth a branche of a vine and put hit in to
thomas hand that is out of the tomb and than he gothe forth to mass and
the branche burgeneth out grapus and be that time the gospel be said the
grapis be ripe than the bishop takythe the grapis and wryngith the wine in the
chales and so singith with the same wine and hoselyth the people. and when any
man or woman comythe that is not worthy to receive this hosell anon the hand
closithe to gedyr and will not opyn till he be shreuen clean and than hit will
opyn Also if any people be in debate they shall be brought be fore thomas
tomb and there the cause shall be rehearsed than woll the hand turn to him
that is in the right and so they be made at one. Thus thomas preuith our
believe and did many wyntres in his days. Also johan crisostomus seythe that
thomas come in to the country there as the three kings of coleyn were and
thomas cristened hem for they had worshippyd god in his birth And there fore
thomas come to hem and taught hem the feythe and the believe of criste to that
believe that we may be sauyd god bring us all Amen.

De natiuitate domini nostri Ihesu cristi.
GOod men and wymmen as ye heryn and seyn as holy church makyth mind and
mention of the great myrthe and me lodye of the blessed birth of our lord
ihesu crist very god and man that was this day borne of his modyr mary in
socour of all man kind But in e special for three causis First to give pese
to man of good will and to light hem that were darcke in sin and for to
draw us with love to him. Thanne as to the first cause he was borne to give
men peese of good will I may well preue this for when he was borne angellys
songhe thus Gloria in excelsia deo etc. Joy be to god in heaven and pese in
earth to man kind of good will At midnighte our lord was borne for be kind all
thing was in pees and rest inshewyng that he was and is Princepa pacia Prince
of peese and come to make pees be twyxe god and man and be twyxe the angel and
man and be twyx man and man And for to be true mediator be twyx god and man he
took nature and kind of both and was both verray god and man and by his
mediacion he knette the love of god to man so saddely that the fadyr of heuyn
spared not him that is his own but sent him in to this world to bye man
kind with his precious blood thourghe his great meekness to joy of paradyse
that man had lost be couetyse of vnbuxsumnes.

Thus he made pees be twyx god and man and man and man. for when angeles say
her lord wroth with man for his vnbursumnes for it is a sin that angeles
hatyn greatly. There fore they kept the gatys of paradyse and would let no
soul come ynne till they say her lord borne of man kind Thanne a none for
love of our lord the angels did mankind worship and spoke goodly to mankind
as to the sheperdys that keptyn her sheep in the country by They bad hem go to
the cite of Bethlem and there they should find a child borne and leyde in a
crache and bad hem do him worship and so they dedyn And ever syn angelys have been frendely to man and lowly end have done reverence to mankind for the
incarnacion of our lord ihesu criste. Thus he made pees between angelys and
man Also he made pees between man and man for a yene the time that our lord
would be borne he made so great pees that in all the world there as kingdoms
and countries were in debate and werred each with othyr on to the time of our
lordis birthe. Than there was so great pees that a man that was called octauian
Emperor of rome and he had the governance of the world for all the world
was subiete to rome and hit dured. xxx. winter in so much that there was a
mau^ment sent out from rome in to all the world comaundyng to all manner of
people should go to the cite that he drew lynage of and ley a penny upon his head
and so offer hit up in knolechyng that he was sogette to the Emperor of rome.
Than must Joseph our ladies husbonde nedys go to the cite of Bethleem for to
offer with other people but for he had no money to offer he took an ox with him
to selle at the cite to make money to do his de^te with but for he durst not
leave our lady be hynde him for she was nyghe her time. And there fore he set
her upon an ass and took her with him. And so when they come to the cite of
Bethleem hit was so full of people so that Joseph and our lady might have no
logyng but turned in to a cabon that was made betwyxse two houses there as the
people of the country set her horses and their asses and other bestis when
they come in to the town to the markette and so there they found a crache
with hey And they set the ox and the ass there to and so there they tarried
all that night. And when hit was a little be fore mydnyght our lady badde
Joseph goo in the town and look her for a myddewyffe when the time was come
she should be delivered(...) asked her where there should after him any be borne
that should be gretter than he Thanne at myd day Sybill looked in the son and
there she say a cercle of gold a boute the son Et in medio circuli virgo
pulch errima And the myd dys of the cercle a fair maiden and a child in her
arm with a crown of gold And when sibyll had shewid this to the Emperor she
said to him this child shall be gretter than those art or ever were or ever
shall be and there fore do him worship and reverence Than a none the emperor
took ensence and deed worship to him and charged all the people to do the
same and to call the child her god and him but a man as other were. Thus all
christian people may learn to do worship and service to this child this day
And there fore the third mass this day is said at myd day in tokenyng that
christian people should come and offer in the worship of this child and his
modyr and shown him servant and suget to him and knoleche this child for his
lord and his god and each man should come to him for love and not for dread And
there fore the office of the mass this day begins thus Puer natus est nohis.
A child is borne to us he seyth and not a man for all christian people should be
bold and not a ferde to come to him to have grace for he is full of grace and
ready to give mercy to hem that askith hit mekely with dew reverence he is ever
ready to give mercy and grace.

In tokenyng that same day that crist was borne in Bethleem a well of water in
rome turned and ran oil all that day showing that the well of grace and
mercy was borne that day that should give mercy and grace to all them that
would come to him and ask mercy and grace and that ye shall here be ensample.



we read of a woman that was defowled in lechery and all most fill in dispayr
of dread. for when she be thought her of the streytenesse of cristes dome
and the gre^^ horrible peynes of hell that were ordained for soche sinners as
she was ^or^ a ferde and be thought her of cristes passion what love he show
de to all christian people she thought she was vnkyn de to him and he sufferid
so sore for h^^ And than she be thought her how children be they never so
wroth and show never so great vengeance how lightly they woll sese and for
give where fore this woman a none cryde to Criste preyng him for his child he
de to for give her and to have mercy on her and a none she herd a voice an
high in the air and said thy trespass is for yeuen the Amen.

Sequitur ^^^uis sermo de sa^rto stephano.


GOod men and wymmen soche a day ye shall have an high day and a holy feste
in the church of seint Stephen the martyr the which was the first martyr
that suffered death for goddis sake after cristes ascension. Than for to stere
your devotion the more to this holy martyr. I will tell you sum what that
he suffered for cristes sake as the book of apostlys tellyth Post ascensionem
domini. after the ascension of our lord that he was styed^vp in heaven the
apostlys labor was all to preche and to teache the word of god to christian
people And for they where to few to serve all the people that rome. there come
so many to turn to the feyth there for they chose.vi. holy men and good
lyuers for to help hem in goddis service of the which seint stephen was one
of hem and the first and the wyseste and was so full of grace and might of the
holy ghost that he did many miracles and marvelous among the people. But
though a man be never so holy ^it he shall have enemies wherefore of diverse
countries that had enmyte to stephene and come ayene him and disputed with
him for to have over come him with disputacion and for they might not they
brought false wyttenesse against him to put him to death But when seynte
Stephene saw and know her malice anon he thought to sese hem be on of these
three weyes other be shamyng in disputacion or be dread of reuolacion or be
preyours of holy orysones. But first he said be shamyngm disputacione For
when they be gonne to dispute with him he was so full of the holy ghost that
they had no pour nor no might for to a gayn sey him And so he over come hem
in all her matters and preued all her matters false that they seyde ayenste And
there for he said he was ready to take the death in very fiyng of all that he
said And so put hem that where great clerks and knew the law and the
prophecy to great shame and velonye. But yet they would not leave but alwey
ayene stood him.

But he was so full of the holy ghost that he preued that he said be great
reason and truth yet would not they be leave it for all that the holy ghost
spoke in heart and yet for all that would not they believe in their concience
that they deed a mysse and there as they seyne the co^mynte turn to the feyth
for wordys and miracles that god showed in her sight yet they again stood him
and set goddis miracles at naught be malice and enmyte of her cursed hertes
and by none other reason of scripture. And so they fretid her hertis withyn him
self and grugged with her tethe for anger and how that they might over come
him with disputacion Than they sought if they might have take him with some
word of Cristes death where by they might have made them a cause to have
put him to death Thanne seynte stephene knew her malice and lift up his
eyes into heaven Et vidit celos apertos And he saw heuyn opyn and our lord ihe
su criste sittyng on his fadyr right hand ready to help him. And there with
his face shone as bryghte as it had be an angel of heaven But when they herd
him speak tha^ where they feign and stoped her erys as though they had herd
him speak false sclaundre of god and so a none drow him out of the cite to
stone him to death as for adisclaunderer Thanne they took.ij. young men that
cowde best hurl stones and took of his clothis and leyde him at the fete of a
young man that hight Saul and after was saint paul Than when saint stephen
saw that he might not sese her malice be reuelacione showing he turned to
devout oryson preyng and yet hit would not be And than they hurled stones at
him and smote out his brain and thanne he cried to god and said Domine i^e su
suscipe spm^ meu^ O thou lord take my spirit for he would prey more de^outly
for his enemies than for him self he knelyd down to the ground and seyde
Pater ig nosce illis quia nesciunt quid faciunt. Fadyr for give hem for they
wot not what they do and anon he slepte in god. Now take he de what brennyng
love he had in his heart to god that preyde more devoutly for his enemies
thanne for him self In this he gave an ensample to all christian people to be in
charity echon with other and to prey for his enemies and hem that pursewe him
and do him dissese ^ni^ersa delicta cooperiit caritas Charity hidith every
trespass for he y^ preyth for his enemies that martyr him with any dissese and
sufferyth patiently he is a martyr be fore god For there is* iij. manner of
martyrdome^. The first is be passion and will there to be will with out
passione be passione with out will The first is shewid by saint stephene that
is set next the birthe of criste for he sufferyth passione and had will
there to saint Johan the euan geliste he had will but no passione The
innocents they suffered passion and no will there to but not against will Thus
may a man be a martyr though he shede not his blood that is when he suffered
great wrong of cursed people and thankyth god there of and takyth hit with good
will and preyth for his enemies devoutly in clean charity Now take heed and ye
shall se how these.iij. where in per^ite love and charity Seint stephen when he
should dye he knelyd down and preyde for his enemies Seint Johan when he
went to war dys his end he said often to hem that ladde him children love to
gedyr for charity is now to salvation The innocents for they were so young
that they cowde not speak yet they shewde love be signs for the deed laughe
and pleyde with her hondes when they saw the knights come with her brighte
s^erd^s to sle hem. than for seint stephyn was so glorious a martyr god shewde
many fair miracles for him.



There was an honest man that had vij. sons and iij. doughtres but in mysse
hap on a day all they wrathyd the modir at ones and in a great anger she
cursed hem all at ones and a none there ^ill great vengeance upon hem for
there come soche a sikenesse one her preuy members that they were so for gnawyn
that they might nethir a bide for woo but walkithe up and down in the
country like mased bestis that all the people that saw hem had great ^ite of
hem

Thanne happid hit so that one of the breshere^ that highte paul and a sustyr
highte palida come in to church of seint stephyn and there they herd people
tell how devoutly seint stephen preyde for his enemies y^ martred him a none
they kneled down and preyde to seint stephene to prey to god for hem and they
would be his true servants and kneled down in the church preyng seint

De sancto io^a^ne euangeliste.


GOod friend is soche a day ye shall have an high feste in holy church the
^este of seynte Johan euangeliste the which was goddis own d^rlyng. where for
all holy church makithe mind and mention of the specialte that once lord
gaffe to him for any other of his disciples Our lord gaffe him grace to keep
his ^ ginite and of keeping of his modir and our lord shewde him his prynyte He
gaffe him grace to keep his virginite that is maydynhode. For this story
tellith and the people have opynned when johan should wedde mari maudeleyne
criste callidr him and he come and sero^d him and johan left the worlds vamte
and sewed our lord and so kept him self clean maiden till he passid out of
this world In preuyng of this when Domician the Emperor of Rome herd the
people tell that johan preched in a country that was callid asia and there
johan made to bilde many churches and when the Emperor herd that he sent
aftyr Johan and made him be put in a brayson tonne full of sethyng oil. and
when Johan had long sodyn there ynne that all the people wend that he had
be all to sodyn and deed Thanne the Emperor badde opyn the tonne and when the
tonne was opyn Johan come out of the tonne and as ^e was clean of all sin so
was he clean of all manner of b^ennyng or harm in all parties of his body. A
nothir hard tourme^t he had on a day Johan saw a temple of jews and was full
of mawmentry and than he preyde to god to distroye hit and a none there with
hit fill down to the ground ^all to powdyr. where fore Aristodimus the
bishop of the temple was so wroth that he put Johan in to prison Thanne
seyde johan yet wolte thou that y shall make the believe in ihesu criste Than
seyde aristo dimus y woll mak^ venym and make hit drink be fore the and when
thou seyste hem deed drink thou there of with out harm and than woll I
believe on thy god than seid ioha^ go and do as thou seyste tha^ ordained the
bishopp^ poison and fette ij. me^ out prison that were dampened to drink of
the poison and anon they were deed tha^ seyde johan if thou give venym to
drink y shall call to my god And than Johan took this poison and blessid hit
and drank there of and he was never the worse but rathir semyd the bettyr and
the fayrer for as he was clean from sin so he was clean from all grenaunce of
the poison yet seyde the bishop he would not believe un to the time he had
seyne these ij. men ar^rid from death to lyffe that where deed. Thanne johan
cast of his cote and seyde Dade et mitte ^a^c tunicam super corpora
defunctorum. Goo and ley this cote upon the deed bodies and sey thus Ihesu
cristus apostell sent me to you and bad that ye should a rise up in goddis
name and a none they resyn to lyffe ayene. Than the bishop with many other
turned and believed in criste and johan cristoned hem and aftyr the bishop
was a full holy man Thus johan had grace to kept him clean both body and
soul and thus he was a martyr to fore god in with stondyng of sin Also he
was keeper of cristus modir for our lord saw the great clennesse that was in
Johan be fore all other when our lord should dye he seyde to Johan. Ecce
matter tua. See thy modyr and be took Johan the keeping of his modir and our
lord seyde to his modir Ecce filins tuns Se thy sone and so be took eythir to
other and when our lord was deed and ley in his tomb Johan took our lady
home with him in to his house and kept her till our lord ^hesu criste was a
reyson from death to lyffe a yen And when our lord was stied up in to heaven he
kept our lady in the same chamber as long as she leuyd aftyr thus he had
grace of keeping of goddis modir Also he had grace of knowing of cristus
p^uite for this was furste wha^ our lord sat at his soper on sherthursday for
great love that johan had to our lord Ihesu criste he leyde his he de to
cristus breast and in the same wise as a man leythe his body down to a well
and drynkithe his body full of water right so johan drank his soull full of
gostly wisdom at cristus breast and at the same time our lord showed him all
his priuyte be fore all other. And for he was old and would not leave to p^che
the word of god the Emperor exi^ed Johan him self a lone in to the isle of
pache mo^ And there god shewde him the apocalippes of the world and of the day
of dome and as he saw hit he wrote hit in great fermacion of holy church But
aftyr wh^ he Emperor was deed Johan was callid again in to the Cite of Emphesie
for there he was Bishop and he come the dyr. And there was a wedowe that
highte drusiana was deed and leyde on a bear Thanne Johan saw much people
weep for her and thanne he seyde Drusiana arise up and make me sum mete and
anon she rose and went for ^he as she had rose from sleep



Hit happid on a time there were ij. young men be prechyng of joha^ they sold
all the good that they had and went forth with Johan for they were rich
men tha^ on a day as they come to the Cite of Pargame they that were her
servants a lite^^ while to fore they were well a ^ayde and where rich men
and they were pore men. Thanne by temptacion of the find they f^re thought
all their purpose and were so^y that they had lost her goodis So anon be
reuelatione of god Johan know her purpose and her hertis and seyde he saw
that the send tempted you and makith you for thynkyng your purpose that ye
were ynne to serve god but go ye to the wode and ethyr of you bring with him a
board on of small yerdys and so they deed. Than thourghe the preyour of Johan
god turned the yerdis in to gold and than seyde Johan to he^ thus now take ye
this gold and be ye as rich as ye were to fore and know well ye have lost
the kingdom of heaven Than happid hit that there was a man deed t^^ same time
and the modyr of him saw Johan and a none fill down on her knees and preyde
him that he would reyse her sone to live as he deed the wedowe drusiana Than
preyde johan to god and this deed man ^ose a yen to lyffe. Than said he to him
I bid the tell these ij. men what thou haste seyne and what joy was ordained
for hem and how they have lost hit. And thanne the man told of the joy of
paradyse and of the peynes of purgatory and of hell how strong and how
horrible the were and how glorious the place was ordained for hem and how sorry
her good angellis were for they had lost that glorious bliss of heaven and
how much joy the fendys made of the tournyng of hem And than the same men were
sorry and cryde to johan and preyde him to prey to god for hem and wept sore
and johan saw hem we^e he preyde to god for hem and yaffe hem penannce and
when he had do so anon the gold turned in to yerdis a yene and aftyr they
were holy men.



A nothir holy reuelacion Johan had shewde by the preuyte of god hit happid
one a day he saw a child that was li ke to have be a man where for Johan
brought him to abishoppe and badde him keep the child and teache him for in
time coming he shall be a man and so this bishop kept him and when he come
to man ne^ state he ga^^e him all to folly and fill in company of ^heuys and in
a while aftir he was a ma stir theffe and the leder of hem Than be reuelacion
of god johan knew all this well y now and come to the bishop and asked him
where this child was and the Bishop told him. than Johan blamed him and
seyde that he had misgouerned the child Tha^ Johan was old and might not
well goo h^ took in horse and rode there as thefeo were and when thyffe saw
Johan anon he fleye a wey than Johan wode aftyr him and cried and seyde Quid
fugia O fili mi. thou my sone why fleiste thy fadir a bide me dear sone and
speak with me thy fadir that is old and may not well goo and than at the last
this man a bode Thanne johan p^ ched so that he left his folly and aftyr was so
holy a man that he was bishop aftir. Thus had johan reuelacion of god dis
preuite.



Hit is wreton in the lyffe of seinte Edward the confessor that ly^he at
wesomestre that seynte Johan the euangeliste ap pered to seint Edward as he
went a procession at the halowyng of the church seinte johan appeared to him
in the likeness of a palmer and preyde the king of good for seint joha^nes
love the eu angeliste for the king loved seint Johan well but hit happid that
the king had no thing ready there but as he took a'rynge of his fingir and
gaffe him and so seynte johan had the ringe vij year aftir and tha^ seynte
johan appeared to ij. knights of the kings that were be yonde the sea toward
iherusalem and ashyd he^ how the king ferde and bade great him well on this
tokyn and took hem the ringe and ask the king for whose love he gaffe that a
wey and bid him make him ready for he shall dye sone and so he deed



A nothir fair reuel^ cion he had when he was sixti winter old and vij
Than our lord ihe su come to him with his disciples and seyde thus.

Deni di^ecte min^ te^pus est ut in mea mensa cum fratih^a tuis epularia

Come my welbelouyd derlyng for now hit is time that thou come and ete with thy

forth with him tha^ seyde our lord to him upon sunday thou (...)e be with me
Thau by sunday he was passing feeble Die dominico conuenit ad iohannem uniuersa
multitudo populi So on the sunday there come to johan a great multitude of
people and tha^ ioha^ made hem to lead him to the church and as he might
speak he seyde to he^ that led him thus.

In fide essetia sta hiles et in mandatia dei feruentea Be ye stable and sad in

Sanctorum inno ^^^tum


GOod frendys ^^ che a day is callid Innocents day sum people ca^le but
children mass day for children were slayue that day for Cristus sak they be
callid innocents that is to sey with out sin for they deed no syn for god
is ever gretely (...) with sin and in special with proud people ^ yense her
neybo^^es doing hem wrong These innocents deed never syn^s ^^ ^onsentyng to
sin where for I may well s^y that they leuyd here with out shame and d^^d
with out blame and were cristoned in her own blood at home and sum in her*
moderes arms. Holy church as this day singithe and redithe in the worship
of these innoce^tes for they were with ynne ij. year of age and there for they
were not a shamed of her own shappe for they were not defowled with no manner
spotte of sin. but the sin that they had of the drawte of kind of our
fadyr Adam and Eve. For Adam and Eve were in the same wise in paradyse the
state of innocentrie fore they where nakyd but they were not ashamed of her
shappe all the while the were with out syn but as soon as they had do sin
anon they saw her own shappe and were ashamed there of and covered her shapp^
with leuys of a fig tree Right so when synn begynnyth to take roode in a
child than innnocensie gothe a wey from him for he kno with good from ille
and ille from good and leuith the good and does ille than he synnethe and than
he is not innocent no longer for thanne greuithe he god. But these children
leuyd not so long to know that on from that other but were slain with ynne
age of innocentrie where fore they leuyd her lyffe with out shame and blame
For king herowde the king of iewis made to sle hem with out gylte. For when
the iij. kyngis come to king herowde and seyde to him Obi est ^ni natua e^ re^
indeorum where is he that is home king of ^e wis and badde him tell hem for
they were come to worshipp^ him fer out of the Este. Thanne wa^ king herowde
foul a stoyned of her word is and asked his clerkys where this child should
be borne and they seyde in Bethleem inde And thanne king herowde told hem so
and bad hem goo thethir and worship him and come again by me that I may go and
worship him. also and so the kings went thethir and worshippid criste and
when they had done here offerynges to criste Per aliam ni^ reuersi sunt in
regionem suam By an other wey they turned home again For the Angel bad hem do
so in her sleep Than was king herowde wondyr wroth and anon ordained to sle
ceiste and when he had made all ready there to hit happid so that the Emperor
of rome sent aftyr him for to come to him in all the haste y^ he might for.n.
of his own sons had accusid him to the Emperor of treson Than herowde
left all his purpose of criste as at that time and rode to rome and had the
better of his sons and come home again with more worship than he had to
fore But yet he thought all wey to sle criste left criste had come to
man's astate and would have put him out of his kingdom. Than sent he a
none and had sle all the children that were in Bethleem and in all the country
a houte that were with in ij. year of age and that were borne same day and so
they deed. For king herowde was going and coming and so taryyng ij. year and
there for he made sle all that ever were with ynne ij. year of age And for he
was so vengable in party hit fill on him self for a child of his own was
slain among other the same time But there come an Angel to Joseph and seyde
to him Accipe puerum et matrem eius et fuge in egiptum Take the child and his
modir and fle in to egipte and be there and so he deed Thus innoce^tes were
slain with out blame and they were not ashamed of their own shappe and they
were cristoned at home in her own blood and not in no font. There fore ye
shall vndyrstonde that there is three manner of cristonyng One is in water as we
be cristonyd in the font Anothir is as these children were cristoned in her
own blood and a thousand martirres mo that shed her blood for cristus sake
The iij. cristonyng is in the feith in the which all patriarchs and prophets
and othyr holy faderis that were before the incarnacione of our lord ihesu
criste y^ believed verily in the coming of crisce the were cristoned in the
feythe Thus ye may see what enmyte this tir^unt king herowde had to shede so
many childerens blood for cristus sake that trespaced not to him nor to none
other. There wept many a modir for there children at that time but god wroughte
full feyre for hem and that tyraunte shewde enmyte and hit fille on him self
for as he partyd an appell with the same knyffe he slew him self Thus he was
glad to shede blood giltelese. and there for at the last he shed his own,
blood.

For he that is with out mercy and ever vengeable often time vengeance fall
lithe on him self And he that loves to do mercy shall have mercy.

And this I may preue by ensample.



We find in the lyffe of seint Siluestre how Co^stantyne the Emperor was
mesell and by counsel of his lechis he made to gadyr iij. thousand children
for to be sleyne and all her blood should be gadered in to a^ ssell and the
Emperor should be ^athi^ all hot there ynne till hit were ^olde. Than these
children were gadered in to a place and the emperor come ridyng in his chair.
but when he come nyghe there as the moderes of the children were the moderis of
the children weptyn and cry ^ din and made great weyme^ tacion on the Emperor
and made a derefull noise. Than asked the emperor what women they were that
made that wey mentacion and the people seyde they were the moderis of the
children y^ should ^e deed for to hele him Than seyde the Emperor hit where a
delefull deed of us all to make thus many to be slain that be fair bodies to
hele on foul body and I am but one man as anothir is and many of these her
aftyr may be full good men and worthy and sto^de the Emperor in good stead.
^ay seyde the emperor I woll not do so but late every woman take her child a
yen home with her for they shall not be deed for me. And tha^ were the wymmen
glad and merry and took her children with great joy to hem and went home. Than
the night aftyr as this emperor lay in his ^edde Petyr and poule come to him
and seyde for the great compassion and pite y^ thou haddiste on the wyme^ and
her children there for send aftyr seint Siluestre and ^e criston and thou
shalt be hole and so he deed and as soon as he was cristoned the lepre fill in
to the water and he was clean fair and hole. Thus ye may see how he that woll
do mercy shall have mercy and they that does vengeance shall have vengeance
So did herowde vengeance and hit fill upon him self and Constantyne the
Emperor did mercy and he had mercy and grace I hope for ever more and so must
we all Amen

De sancto thoma epo^ Ca^tuarien^.


GOod men and wymmen soche a day ye shall have se^^t Thomas day that was slain
for the right of holy church and the law of this land. This holy man
seint thomas was borne in the Cite of london and his ^adir was callid Gilbert
that was shryue of london. Than aftyrward he ordained him self and yode in to
(...)e holy land and there (...) was take and put in p(...) Than come a
worshippefull woman to him and sryde yif he would ^lighte her his truth to
wedde her she would help him and bring him out of dissese and he deed so Tha^
come gilbert home in to England and when this woman saw her time she come
aftyr and met in london at the church of poules Tha^ Gilbert made the
bishop^ to criston her and aftir ward for to wedde hem to gedyr and gilbert
gate seint Thomas on this woman. So when scho was with child she dremyd in a
night that she come to seint poules church but when she would have gone ynne
she thought her womb was so great that she might not in to the church by no
wey Thanne on the mo row she went ^n to her confessor and told him all the
dreme than seyde he dame be glad and thank god highely for thou haste a child
in thy body that all holy church shall be to litill to resceyue him Thanne was
she glad and thankyd god highely and so sone aftyr this child was borne and
was callid thomas. tha^ he wexed a man and so he was a man in all degree for he
served the king manly and served god worthily and deyde fore the lewis of holy church mekely I may well sey he served the king manly for when he was made
chaunceler of En glond this land was so full of outeland men and so sore over
set with he^ that there might no man goo by the wey un robbed. But in short^
time aftyr Thomas with his wisdom and his manhood he drofe them out of this
land that all the people might goo un robbed. Thomas wa^ also manly in
repeyryng of the kings maneres that were let down and destroyed and in
special the kings paleyse in london at westmestre that was all let fall
down But between Estye and witsonty de thomas made to repair hit a yene for
he had there so many workmen of diverse craftys that a man should onethe
here his fellow speak for donnyng of strokys. He was also manly in dedis of
arms for there as the king had many Castellis and towns out of his hondis
and he spe^te much good to get them and shed much blood for get hem a
yene at the furste and they were hold out of his hondis Than thomas with his
wit and wisdom get hem a yene Also when he was in the kings werres of
france he quyte him so manly that when the king of england had exiled thomas
the king of france was his chief help and socoure Also thomas was as manfull
in his array for he was clothyd in the best and richeste clothe and furre that
might be found And also his repair to his hose sadeles brydele s^hon^ as
bryghte as any silver he was also manfull in his household for hi^ hall was
every day in some^ cheson strawed with gr^ne ruschis And in winter with clean
hey fore to save the knights clothis that sat in the flore for de ^awte of
place to sit o^ for there come so many every day to ete of his mete and
drink for he would have of all manner of deyntes that might he found in thi^
land

In so much that the king him self many time vnwarned come to Thomas to mete
both for love that he had to Thomas and also to see the array and also revel
that was in thomas household for there sp^ke so much people worship by
Thomas. And where fore more trewer and also better love that thanne was between
the king and thomas while hit last was never between to men. where for I put
this ensample Hit happid that hit fill in a cold winter as the king and Thomas
come rydyng to gedyr in to chepe side at london the king was ware of a poor man
that was well nere nakyd and had no clothis and was sore a cold Thanne said
the king to thomas hit were a great alms deed to give to this poor man betyr
clothes Sire seid thomas of soche ye should take heed Thanne had thomas on a
clothe of good scarlet and well furryd with rich furre than the king leyde
ho^de on this clothe and would have pullid hit from thomas for to have give it
to this poor man but thomas held hit fast and thus they wrastelid long in so
much that they were like to fulle to the ground. but at the last be favor
thomas suffered the king to take his clothe of and than the king cast hit to
the poor man and bad him run a wey fast and selle hit and bey him other and
if thou be set hit well thou may fare the better ever whiles thou leuyste
Than thomas feigned him self wroth but in his heart he was well a paid that
his roue was so well befette Thanne the people meruelyd gretely furste what was
between the king and thomas but when they saw what hit mened the people were
glad and had great sport there of. This I sey to show ensample how well they
louyd to gedyr thus thomas served the king manfully. also we must learn of
our holy patron seynte thomas to serve god deuoutely. when he served god
full devoutly for as soon as he was made arch bishop of Caunterbury a none he
turned his leuyng in to better leuyng and thought to serve the king of heaven
as well as he had the king of this world be fore. Thanne a none he leyde a
wey scarlet and rich furrys and wered clothe of myddell pryse and cast a wey
silk and send^ll and weryd here next his body that was right hard and a
bryche of the same hame side in the which was so much vermyn that hit was an
horrible sight to see but this know but litill people. Also every wedenysday
and freyday he made his confessoure to beat him with a rod on the bare body
like as a child is beat in scole Also he vsid every day to wesche ttre pore
men's fete knelyng one the ground and thanne he yaffe each of hem four
pennys And also much more penance he vsid in preyng and wakyng that were to
much to tell at this time. Thanne when thomas was in the abbey of pou^teney
upon a day whann he had seyde mass he knelid down be for the Auter in his
preyour^s than the Abbote of the same place had to speak with him and stood
vndyr a pilour and abode thomas And he saw how our lord The s^ criste
appeared to Thomas and told him how he should be slain in canterbury in his
own church for his sake and bad him be steadfast and hold forth as he had
be gonne Than come thomas out of his chapel and a none the Abbot fill down
to the ground and Sire ye may bliss the time and the hour that ever ye were y
borne and also blessid mute sho be that ever did bear you for to have soche a
visitacione as I have herd you have.

Thanne se^de thomas I charge the that thou tell hit never to no man while y am
a live no more he deed but when thomas was deed he told it opynly to all the
people Thus I may well sey that thomas served god devoutly. Also he dyed for
the law of holy church mekely for whann he saw the king began to make laws
to over set holy church and soche law is as would have destroid the land.
Than thomas put him self forth and repreuyd the king of his miss dedis
tha^ was the king wroth ^ made a parliament at northampton and for thomas would
not set his seile to the cursid law is that the king and his sorry counsel
had ordained and made a none they callid him a traitor to the king and exiled
him out of his land. Thanne thomas went to the king of france for socour
and help and full goodly and mekely he res^eyued him and all his clerkys and
found hem all most vij year all that they be houyd Thanne great disseses and
greuaunces thomas had of the king of england and all he suffered mekely Than by
tretice and counsel of the (...) and of the king of France there was made a
faynti loueday between the king and thomas But when the king should have kyssid
thomas he would not for he seyde he had made his a vow he would never kiss him
but bad him go home to his church boldly Than by the counsel of the king of
france and bidding of the P^p^ thomas come home to Caunterbury Than were there
iiij. cursed knights of leuyng y^ thought to have had a great thank of the
king and made her a vow to gedir to s^e thomas And so on child remasse day all
most at might they come to caunterbury in to thomas hall Sire Reynolde
^eriston Sire willi am ^racy Sire Richard breton and sire he we morley Thanne
Sire Reynolde berysto^ for he was bitter of kind a none he seyde to thomas the
king that is he yonde the sea sent us to the and bad that thou shuldeste a
soil the bishop that thou cursiddiste than seyde Thomas seris they be not a
cursed by me but by the (...) and I may not a soil that he has cursid well
seyde Reynolde than we see thou wolte not do the kings byddyng and swore a
great oath by the eyon of god thou shalt be deed. than cryde the other
knights sle sle and they went down to the court and armyd hem Thanne
prestis and clerkys drowe hem to the church to thomas and spered the doors to
hem. But wha^ thomas herd the knights armed and would come in to the church
and might not he went to the door and un barred it and took one of the
knights by the hand and seyde hit be semythe not to make a castle of holy
church and took hem by the hand and seyde come ynne my children in goddis
name Thanne for it was myrke that the might not see nor know thomas they
seyde where is the traitor nay seyde thomas no traitor but archebishoppe
Thanne one seyde to him fle fore thou art but deed. Nay seyde thomas y come
not to fle but to a bide.

Ego pro deo mori parat^^ sin et pro defensione iusticie et ecclesie liberate
I am ready to dye for the love of god and for the fredomme and right of holy
church Tha^ reynold with his swerdes point put of thomas cappe and smote at
his head and cu^tte of his crown that it ho^ge by like a dische Than smote a
nothir at him and smote hit all of than fill he down to the ground on his
knees and elbowes and seyde god in to thy ho^des I put my cause and the
right of holy church and so deyde Than the iij. knight smote and his half
st^oke fell upon his clerkis arm that held thomas cross be fore him and so
his sword fill down to the ground and brake of the point and he seyde go we
hens he is deed And wha^ they were at the door going whert broke went a geyne
and set his foot to thomas neck and thruste out the brain upon the pam ^t
Thus for right of holoy church and the law of the lord thomas took his
death.

Thanne how this marterdome was known in iherusalem ye shall here. there was an
abbey of monks in the which that same day and the same time that thomas dyed
a monk lay at the death than for he was a good holy man of leuyng his abbote
bad him if hit were not to god displesaunce wha^ he were deed he should come a

De circumcisio^e domini.


GOod frendis so che a day is callid new yeris day and is the first day of the
beginning of the New year that is coming and is the last day of the year that
is gone. And there fore this day ye shall come to god and holy church to here
your deuyne service forth this year. For like as a good servant that has a
good mastir makithe his comenaunt but ones but holdithe forth from year to
year having full trust in his maistre that he woll for his good service yeffe
him a good toward in his great need at his last end. In the same wise goddis
seruauntis makythe comenaunte with him ones yt is at cristonyng at the founte
and there he makythe comenaunte to be goddis servant having full trust in god
that at his great need that is at the day of dome quyte him for his service
in ever lastyng bliss of heuene and so woll he do to all that be good true
servants Thus this day is called new yeris day.

Also hit is callid Circumcisi^ ^^mini the circumcision ^^ our lord

Also this day is callid new yeris day for this day is the first day of the ka
lendyr and the year gothe much he kalendyr there for his is callid new yeris
day Seinte Austein seith this day and this night he thyn people use many false
opynions and wyche craftys and false be leave the which be not to tell among
christian people les te they turned to that use where fore ye that be criste^
people be well were left ye be desceyued be any false so^ery as be taking
counsel of on man be fore a nothir or in being or sellyng or in borowyng or
senyng in the which sum have diverse opimons. And if they be well shreuyn
they be worthy for to have great penance for there miss believe for that
comythe of the fend and not of god This day is callid the circumcisione of
our lord for as holy chuche tellith this day he was circumsised and blede his
blood for our sake for when the flesche was cut he blede fast and was full
^ore for he was but young and tendyr and but viij days old and there fore he
blede the more. Thanne ye shall understand that he bledde v. times fore us.
^ni^^^ enim ^i ci^^a sa^guin^ s^^ pro nobi^ eff^dit The first time that he
shed his blood was as this day when he was circumcised. A nothir was for fer
of his passione for right as a child wepith for fere wha^ he seethe the rod
and has no harm so the flesche of our lord swede blood for dread of a
strenger passion that was coming. The thridde time was in his flagella cion*
when he was betyn with stourges so that all his body ran on read blood. The
fourth time was wha^ he was nay led hand and foot on the cross. The fifte
time was wha^ that longinus perisched his heart with a spear that watyr and
blood come out of his wou^des And than they took up the cross with the body
and lift hit up on high and with a sodeyne fall they let the cross fall
down in to the mortesse that all the senowis and v^ynes and joints braste a
two and blood and watyr come out of every wound this he suffered for us Tha^ne
seethe criste was cicumcised and shed his blood thus for us y^ was with outyn
sin and circumcision is for sin remedy and help why would he be
circumcised that did no sin Sanctus augu stiuua dicit ^ropterquat^or causa^
Seint Austeyn se^th hit was for four causes. the first was to make a seethe
with the jews for else they would and might have seyde that he hade be of her
law where for they would not resceyue him consent to his techyng. this was to
disceyue the fend For right as the fend disceyued a dam and Eve and so all
mankind was dampened So hit fill to criste to disceyue the fend where thourghe
all mankind might be saved. than whau the fend saw that he was circumcised
as a no^^ir child he wend y^ he had take that penance in remedy of
original sin. and so he know him not from a nothir child for if he had
know him verily that he had rome to have bought mankind he would never have
tysed the jews to have put criste to death. And this was all the cause that
our lady was weddid to Joseph for to disceyue the fend for the fend should
wend that Joseph had be his fadir and not consceyued of the holy ghost The
thrydde cause why he was circumcised that was in confermyng the old law in
great comfort to the old fadres y^ were of the old testament fore and if he
had be cristoned and not circumcised hit had be a great discomforte to all
that were be fore the incarnation of our lord ihesu criste The fourth cause
of his circumcision was for our lord woste well that there would come heretics
aftyr that would have seyde y^ criste had a body of the erthely fantesy and not
of flesche and blood as on of us have for a body of the eyere may not blede And
there for to put a wey all soche errors criste was circumcised and blede in
his cut tyng of his flesche the which flesche was cut from his membre an
angel aftyr brought hit to king charles for the most precious relike in the
world and for the gretteste worship that he ^owde do there to he brought hit
to rome to a church that is callid Saneta sanctorum For these iiij. causes
criste was circumcised This day also hit is callid the vtas of the natiuite
that is the viij. day of our lordis birthe in great tokenyng to all us that
bethe good servants to think on these viij. days that folowith the birthe
The first day is to think y^wardly on the sede that we were conceived of that
is foul and abomynable in hit self that as a man or a woman be they never so
feyre that and they saw the matter they would have be a shamed of him self to
think ^ he were ever conceived of that foul think.

The secounde day is to think how grievously he ^aynithe his modir in his
birthe in so much that hit is an great miracle of god that she may have her
lyffe The iij day is to think how feeble and how wreched he is borne for all
the bestis of kind somewhat ca^ help hem self sau man kind he nothir may nor
can help him self in no degree but dye a none but he had help and socoure
of other. The iiij. day is to think in how much parell and dread he leuithe
here fore in e^^ry place death folowith him and is ever ready to fall on him
what time newere no man knowithe but only god him self In certum est locua in
quo more te exspectat. It is in certain the place there as death a bidithe the
The v. day is for to think how horrible death is when he comythe for in
short space and time he makyth a man to stink that all the best frendis
that he has be a vysed to put him in to the earth and hyde him there. The vi.
day is to think how rewfull is the departing of the body and the soul that
may not be departed till the he rte in the body br^ke fore dread of the sightes
that the soul shall see that for great fere the he rte brekyd. O more quam
amara est memoria tua. O thou death how bitter it is to think upon when
th^w art coming to any man.

The vij. is to think how dredefull is the dome that he shall goo to a none
and how streyte his judgment shall be tha^ he that woll think one these vij.
days besely on the viij. day I hope he shall be circumcised that is he shall
be cut a wey from the lust of his flesche and of sin and so do part from
this worlds likkyng. and thus comyth the viij. day that is the ^tas of criste
that is the joy of bliss that shall never have end to the which god bring
us all to Amen.

Judie epiphanie
GOod frendis this day is callid the xij. day but hit is the xiij. day of
cristus birthe The which day holy church callid hit the Epiphania domini that
is to sey the showing of our lord ihesu criste verray god and man for this day
he was showed verray god and man be three offerynges be his cristonyng and also
be tournyng of water in to wine. The xiij. day of his birthe be offering of the
three kings and that same day xxx. winter and xiij. days aftyr his birthe he
was cristened in the water of flom Jordan and that same day twelfemonthe aftyr
he turned water in to wine at the weddyng of cane galilee. But the feste
makythe most mind and mention of the iij. kings offering and there late us
follow the form of holy church. and here ye shall here how hit fill of her
offering to our lord Jhesu criste verray god and man These three kings where
of the lynage that prophesied how a sterre should shine of Jacob but they were
no jews of kind but they had herd by prophecye of this where fore the
had great desire and ^usce to see hit and so oftyn time when might come to
gedyr upon certain high hills than they would dispute among hem of this
sterre So hit happid upon Cristemas night the same time as our lord was
borne they were to gerdyr and were disputyng of this sterre Super mo^tem
auctorele^. upon the hill

Dominna enim erat ^at^a Our lord was borne Et appar^ it illis And apperid to
hem in the sterre as fair a child and vndyr his head a bryghte cross of
gold and seyde thus to hem goo ye a none in all the haste that ye may in to
the land of jury and ta^e with you Gold mirre and ensence And offer these three
things to him that ye shall find there new born^ king of Jews verray god
and man and I shall be your gyde and led you the wey. Thanne they a none for
great haste they took bestys that be callid dromedaries that be of soche a
kind they be so swifte that they woll run further in on day than any other
best wolle run o^ go in three days And so they come to Iherusalem that was
the che^e Cite of all jury hopyng that they should here there sum tydinges
where that this child was borne. But as soon as they turned in to the Cite of
Iherusalem thanne they lost the sight of the Sterre that ladde hem ever the
wey till that they come the dyr bryghter thanne the son Thanne wha^ they come
in to the Cite of iherusalem they rode to king he rowde for he was there the
same time and seyde to him ^bi est qui natua e^re^ indeorum where is he that is
borne that is king of jews. ^idimus enim stellam eius in orient. we saw his
sterre in the este ^eniemus adora^e eum we be come to worship him. Thanne
king he rowde was troubeled and all the Cite with him but more fore flateryng
of him man of any love that they had to him Thanne king he rowde asked his
clerhys where this child should be bore and they said in Bethleem ^de. Tha^
king herowde askid the kings p^uely of the sterre and bad hem goo in to
Bethleem and worship the child and come ayene by him and tell him where he
might find the child that he might goo worship him. Thanne when the
kings where passed toward bethleem a no^ the sterre aperid to hem and when
they saw the sterre was come again they were glad in their hertys and as hit is
in many places peynted the king that is in the myddell for great loye of the
sterre he lokyd bacwarde to his fellow be hind him and with his finger shewid
him the sterre And that is the cause that the myddyll king lokyd bacwarde. And
thus the sterre brought hem to bethlee^ and when the sterre come over the
house there as our lord was ynne he stood stille Than the kings lyghted down
and yede in to the house and with all the reverence that they cowde knylyng a
down and offered each of he in these iij things Anrum tusse et mirram Gold
cense and mirre knowlechyng by the gold that he was king of all kings And by
the ^ncense that he was verrey god And by the myrre that he was verey man and
sholld be deed and leyde in grave with c^te roting.

For golld is chief of all metallis Ensens is burnt in holy church in
worship to god. Mirre is an oyntement that kepithe deed bodies from ^tyng.
Thus when the kings had do her offering be techyng of the angel Per altam
viam reuersi sunt in regionem suam By a nothir wey they went toward her own
lands and left king herowde. and the ster^^ vanisched a wey from hem. Thanne
as seynte Bernard seythe joseph kept of this gold as much as him nedith^ to
his tribute that he should pay to the Emperor and also more to keep our lady
with while she lay in child bed and the remenaunte be delid to pore people
soche as had great need there to. The sense he burnt to put ^ way the
stenche of the stable there as she lay ynne. And with the Mirre our lady a
noynted her child to keep him from worms and disseses

But what be fill of the kings aftyr I find nothing in certain but sum
people have an opynyone how that seynte Thomas of Inde Cristoned hem wha^ he
come in to that country of Inde. and than as the sterre lyghtenyd hem to
cristus birthe So the holy ghost lyghtenithe hem in her souls and taught
them the perfyte wey of the be leave and also of perfect and gracious leuyng in
so much that they left all her kingdom and went forth one pilgrr^mages
that is for to say to Iherusalem and in many other places and so they come
forth to myllayne and there they diede all three. And so aftyr that they were
translatid to coleyne and there they be yet. Now have ye herd by these three
kings how our lord ihesu criste was this day showed verray god and man where
for like as they offered with great deuocio^ so should ye do your offerynges
when ye come to holy church kneling down with all the reverence that ye can
or may not on your one kne as to a temperall lord but on both your knees and
do him worship with good preyoures Than offer ye preciouse gold for there is
no gold so p^cious as is the good preyoure devout And than hold up your
hondis to him with all the reverence that ye can and devout heart prey to him
and show him all your love of your hertes and than ye offer to him ensence.
For there is none ensence sauerithe so sweet byrnyng in the fire as does good
preyoure that is devoutly seyde with a byrnyng love in clean charity And if
thou do thus than thou offereste knelyng on thy knees make a cross on the
earth and kiss hit and think well thou art but earth. than must ye offer
mirre for right as mirre kepithe a body from rotyng so the mind of death
kepithe a man's soul from dedly sin in this wise do ye your offering and
than shall ye have as much mede as had the se iij kings. Also he was showed
both god and man at his cristonyng For he come to the water of flom Jordan he
went in to the water and hallowed hit for right as he was circumcised to
conferme the new law and for no need that he had there to for he was clean
with out sin but for to make the sacrament that should wasthe hem took
cristonyng in his name from all sins

Thanne was ioha^ baptiste ready there and much people with him that come
thethir to the cristo nyng. Than said Johan to our lord all qua king and
tremelyng. blessid lord thou art god dislambe with out syn thou haste no need
to be cristoned of me but that I ^ man gotyn and borne in sin have need to
come and be cristoned of in remission of sins

Thanne seyde our lord criste jhesu johan suffer at this time for thus we
must fulfille all right wisneste and johan cristoned our lord ihesu criste
and as hit is credible our lady was cristoned aftyr with other of cristus
disciples and all the people that were come thedyr Than when all were cristoned
our lord went out of the watyr and as he went out of the brynke of the
watyr and all the people with him Apertisu^t ^eli heaven opened and a great
light be clipped him in sight of all the people the holy ghost come down in
likeness of white dove and lightid on cristus head and the fadir spoke and
seyde thus in heryng of all the people Her est filiu^ mena dilectua in quo
michi been complacui. This is my well-beloved sone the which plesith me This was
to teache all criston people the feythe of the be leave of holy church for all
criston people be bound to be leave stead fastely in the fadyr and the sone and
the holy ghost.

In baptismo christi toto trinitas semauifesta^it scilicet. Pater in noce
filin^ in carne* spiritus sanctus in columba et totum celum apertum est

In cristus baptym all the holy Trinite was shew^d for the fadir spoke in
voice when he said Hic est filin^ men^ dilectu^ This is my well-beloved sone and
was there bodily when Johan baptiste seyde

Ecce agnus dei and the holy ghost was sent Sicut columba as a white dove
These ben three persons in on godhede for the fadir spoke above and the sone
was there bodily and the holy ghost in likeness of a dove ye shall be leave
that these iij. persons be but one god in trinite This be leave ye shall know
on the watyr brynke that is in your cristonyng at the founte where fore he
that beleuythe thus and does werkys of be leave shall be saved Qui crediderit
et baptisa^u^ fuerit sal^^^ erit He that beleuithe and is cristoned shall be
saved and folowithe the werkys of believe.

Qui ^ero non crediderit condem^na bitur And he that beleuithe not nor doth^
not the werkys of believe shall be dampened The werkis of believe be mekenes and
charity for with out these ij. shall no man be saved and he that has these
ij. he is wreton in the genelogie of our lord ihesu criste the which is radde
in cristemasse that begynnethe a boue with Abraham And so comythe downewardes
to joseph and to our lady ^n showing that he that is most mekyste in heart is
most next our lord ihesu criste and soche he a vaunsith in everlasting
bliss And there for the Genelogie this night begynnythe at ihesu criste and
gothe vpwardes to abraham and so to god Also he was showed verray god in
trinite whann he turned watyr in wine at the weddyng. Hit happit so the people
^^ackyd wine at the mete.

Thanne badde our lord that they should take vi. steues or pottys that were
empty and bad fill he^ with watyr and they did Thanne our lord blessed hem and
bad they should ^ere them that be ganne the table and late him begin and
than he be ganne and said hit was the best wine that ever he drank. Thus our
lord showed him self both god and man god in that he turned watyr in to wine
and man in that he et^ and drank with hem This miracle he shewde at the
weddyng in tokenyng that he blessed all weddynges that he done aftyr the law
of holy church And there for keep your wedloke and be in full feythe and
believe of holy church as holy church techithe and so ye shall come to ever
lastyng bliss Amen

De con^ersi^^^ sancti pauli.


GOod frendis soche a day ye shall have (...) lis day that is callide ^^^
con^ersion of seint poule for that day he was co^uertid^ and ^^^^ned from a
cursed tyraunte in to goddis servant from ^^ high man and a prowd^ in to a
meke man and a good man and from the disciple of the de^yll in to goddis holy
apostell so for this man was tournede from all wickkednesse in to great
goodness in great strenghte help and socoure to all holy church There for
holy church holdithe his ^ouersion and so we do of no mo but of him only and
that i^ for iij. causes. The first for great miracles in his tourning and for
the great joy in his defendyng. and fore the ensample of his amendyng First
or he was turned he was called saul for right as saul the king of Jherusalem
pursewed holy david to have slain him right so the saul porsewed criste and
his disciples to bring hem to the death. There for while criste went one earth
here this saul would never come to him to here his techyng but as soon as
criste was steied up in to heaven than a non this saul for he was learned and
cowde the Jews law he be ganne to with stand and a yense seyde cristus
disciples disputyng a yense hem and poursewed hem in all he might in full
entente to have distroied hem and christian feythe. Thanne on a day he disputed
with seynte Stephyn and for he might not over come him he be thought him how
he might bring him to his death and so he left him never till he was deed
Thanne hit is the manner of the fendes children when they have done a cursed
deed to be glad and feign there of proud in her hertis and ^encrese her malice
^o was saul glad of the death of seynte Stephyn and fore he would have gotyn
him a name of wickedness passing all his fellows he went to hem that had the
jews law to keep and get him a letter of warraunt for to take all that be
leued in in criste where they might be found and to bring hem to Jherusalem
for to be put to the death there. Thanne when ^e had these lettres he took
soch a pride there with and envy in his heart a yenste cursten people that when
he herd any man speak of hem a none fore great anger he would snefet the nose
and frothe at the mouth for anger and grugge with his tethe thretenyng and
masesseynge towardis hem that all Christian people was sore a ferde of him.
Thanne on a day he herd that in the Cite of damask was much criste^ people
hid for dread and rode the dyr wards but a none our lord ihesu cristeshewed
the sweetness of his grate when this saul was in his high^pride and in
will to have do most harm Than a boute midday our lord cast a light of
grace a boute that was much lyghter thanne the son and the light spoke to
saul thus. Saul saul quid tu me perseq^ri^. Saul saul what folowest thou
me and a none he was a ferde and fill down of his horse and cryde and seyde
for great fere Quis es tu domine Lord what art thou than seyde our lord. Ego
sum ihesus ua sarenua. I am ihesu of nazareth for that was the name of his
manhood Thanne saul a none be leued on him and seyde lord what wolte thou that
I shall do Thanne saw the people^ a boute him the light and herd the wyre
but they saw no thing but a none went, to saul and took him up by the hand
fore he was blind and might not see and so ladde him in to the Cite to a good
man's house and there he was three days and three nyghtis fasting and nothir
ete mete nor drink ^e might not fee but ever preyde to god fore dread of that
vision The which time the holy ghost taught him cristus law Than the thridde
day on of cristus disciples that highte Ananyas as god bad him come to him full
sore a ferde and said Saul frater dominua ihesua misit me ad te qui apparuit
tibi in via Saul the lord has sent me to the ihesus that apperid to the in
the wey and that thou shuldeste see and be cristoned. and when Ananias leyde
his hand upon his head a none he saw and there fill from his eyes like
scales of fisches. And wha^ he had cristoned him he callid him Poule. and
than ete and was comforted and had his strenghte and was there a few days
with the disciples. Than went ^e in to the temple and prechid openly of our
lord thesu criste p^uyng clerckly that he was both god and man and none other.
Stu^ebant autem omn^a qui eum andiebant et dicebant. For fothe all that herd
him were a stoyned and seyde that hit was a great miracle and grace of god and
his ^o deyne conversion for he ^ was of so cursed leuyng so litell be fore was
^o sone turned to god and man Thus may ye here how great miracle god shewde in
his conversion and how great joy holy church makyth of his defendyng hit was
great joy to all christian people that was a litill be fore to distroye christian
people and a non aftyr as besy to encrese christian people* And he that was so
besy and so glad to shede christian men's blood. than was he so ready to shede
his blood for hem. And as besely as he went to put hem to death than with as
good a will h^ was ready to take the death for hem and there as no man durst
p^^he the word of god for him aftyr the comfort that they had of him they
spared not for lord nor fore king but openly preched the word of god and
taught the feythe aftyr in every place And he that was to fore so proud and
so feres and sone aftir was so meke and so lowly y^ he fill to the ground to
every christian man's foot that ever he ^respased to and mekely be sought hem
of mercy with a full pacient heart where fore seynte* Austeyn likenyth him to
an Onicorne of kind that berith an horn in his nose and with that home he
^leithe all the bestys that he fightithe with Also he is so ferse in him self
that thee may no hunter take him but thus they wolle be gile him they wolle
aspey where the unicorn hauntith and use to walk and there they wolle set a
meyde and as soon as the unicorn seethe the maid a non be kind he wol fall
down and ley his head in her lap and than all the might and streghte is
gone And than they come and take him. Thus he seythe seynte Poule was first fo
ferse in him self that they durst not preche there as he was nor speak to him
for dread. But when our lord ihesu criste showed him sweetness of his grace
and this fair maid that is the law of holy church a none poule fill down
to the ground and was soget to all criste^ people here fore holy church was
glad of his defendyng He is set also in high ensample of high a mendyng
for our lord is so gracious y^ all christian people may be saved that woll for
fake her mys^e leuyng and be conuertid Multomagis gaudiu^ erit in celo de vno
peccatore penitenciam age^ re quam de nonagin ta n^uem qui uo^ indigent
penitentia. There is more Joye in heaven upon on sinner doing pen^unee thanne
upon xcix. that deed never sin And there for our lord would that all were
conuertid and saved where fore in high ensample and coumforte to all sinful
people he set seynte Poule to look upon for though a man had do never so
much sin and he would fore sake his sin and sin no more Thanne all the
company of heaven makythe myrthe and melodye of his conversion as we do here in
earth of the conversion of seynte Poule but there is much people that love
more sin with lust and likelyng in this world than they do god. Fore there
be many that wolle never leave sin nothir for the love of god nor for the
desire of the bliss of heuene nor for fer^ of the fend nor dread of the great
pains of hell But sum people seyne god wolle never lose that he has
boughte dear with his passion. but they that sey so be notte wise god would
that none were lost but be ware thou lose not thy self for all the while
thou loueste, more sin than god and had lever to serve the fend than god
thou art cause of thine own dampnacion fore while thou haste more will to
serve the fend and be his child than goddis child thou lesiste thy self and
god has ordained fendes to tourmente hem in ever lastyng pain But seinte
Gregor seyth they that shall be dampened begin her penance here in this
world in party and aftyr her death contin^ueth of ever more. where fore I tell
you this ensample



There was a man and that was an officer with a lord and stood a cursed and on

GOod frendis soche a day ye shall have candelmas day that day makith m^de and
mention of our lady and of her sone and speciyally iij thingis our ladies
purificacion in sime onis metyng and in ca^d^les offering. This day is callid
the purificacion of our lady in englische hit is the clensing of our lady but
fore no need that she had there to fore sche was clensid with the worchyng of
the holy ghost in conceyuyng of her sone that there was in her no manner of
spotte of filthe.

But for that day was the xl. day from the birthe of her sone and was callid in
the jews law the day of the purificacione not only for our lady but for all
other wymmen where fore we call hit the purificacion of our lady The law of
the jews was soche that a woman that was delyueryd of a man child was hold
unclean vij. days aftyr tha^ the law gave her leave to go to her husbonde. but
yet she was unclean xxxiij day^^ but till xliiij. days were fullfilled she
should hold her with out the church with her offering And the offering* in
those days was of a rich man a lamb and for a pore man ^^s a peyre of
turtyll doves or else other doves and so offered our lady with her sone And
if a woman be delyueryd of a maiden child she should duble all those same
days a fore said that is for to say the coming to her husbonde. and also the
coming to the temple and so this is there son there of For hit is so that all
great clerkys sey that hit to vij. days aftyr when a woman has conceived a
man's child or that the same sede turn in to blood.

And hit is also.xxxiij. days aftyr o^ it turn to any shappe of man. and
than god sent lyffe in to hit and if hit be a maid child hit doublithe all
the days both in tournyng in to the blood and also in shappe of body and this
is the cause. eve that was the furste ^ormyd woman that e^^r wrathid our lord
more tha^ did the man Adam therefore she is longer in formyng Thus fore fleschly
complexion of man and woman she is un clean in her self there for this
purificacion is ordained But vnderstondith well that our lady had no need to
this clensing fore she conceived not with complexion of man but only of the
holy gosce so that she was clean of all manner of filthe touching consent of man
But yet she went to the temple no other wymmen deed specially for iiij.
causes. The first was to fullfillethe scripture that seyth thus Quanto mai^e^
ta^to te humilie^ The higher that thou art in degree the mekyr thou shulde^^e
make the Thus did our lady for she wyste well sche was modir to goddis sone of
heaven and had so great worship passing all other wymmen yet sche made her as
the poreste woman that was in the company. The secou^de cause was as she
fullfillithe the law of circumcision of her sone in the same wise she
fullfillid the purificacion and in offering of her sone in the temple doing for
him as other pore wymmen did for her children.

The thridde cause for to stop the jews mouths left they had seyde that she
had not do the law and so caughte a great sclaundre a yense h^e^ in time
coming.

The fourth cause was for to give ensample to all other wymen that they should
come to church aftyr the birthe of her child and thank god that he has
sauyd hem from death in her trauelyng for in that time a woman is in great
parell of death for there is no sikenes in the world that gothe so nyghe death
fore these causes holy church makythe mind of our ladies purificacion Hit
makythe mind also of the coming of symeon and Anne Symeon ille senex din
vixerat ^ine etas cooperatur Anne

This symeon was a passing old man but he had preyde to god besely all his
lysse that he should never dye till he had seyne criste bodily in this world
and so he deed And this Anne has preyde the same Also ye shall understand
that this was not ^ine our ladies mo dir but an other a^na*that had a husbonde
vij. year and when her husbonde was deed she would not be weddid no more but
leuyd till she was lxxx. year old and served god in the temple night and day
and preyde to se god or she dyede and our lord grauntid her. Thanne when our
lady come into the temple with her sone the holy ghost warned symeon and Anne
and a none they with much joy went a yenste him and brought him in to the
temple

Et Symeon accepiteum in uluaa sna^. And symeon took him in his arms with all
the reverence that he cowde and might and seyde. (...) dimittis sernum tuum
domine secundum nerhum ^num in pace and cetera. O thou lord now for give thy
servant aftyr thy word in pese. and so with all the worshipp^ and reverence
that he could he louyd and tha^kid him that he would let him leave so long to
see him bodily with his eye^ where in mind of this when a woman comythe to
church of a child she a bydithe at the church door till the priest come and
cast holy water on her and takythe her in by the hand in to the church
yeuen her leave aftyr to come to church and to goo to her husbonde for and they
have comened to gedyr be fore they must both shreyue he^ there of and take her
penance Also holy church makythe mind of candels offering and as ye see hit
is a common use for all christian people that be of convenient age to come that
day to church and bear a candell brennyng in procession as though they went
bodily with our lady. But now ye shall here how this worshippefull feste
was first found Sum time when the Romans by great might and vial
power conquered all the world fore they had great dominacion they were so
proud that they for get her god and made hem diverse goddis aftyr her own
lust And so among all they had a god that they called Mars that had be to
fore a notable knight in battle And so they preyde to him fore help and fore
they wol^^ speed the better of this knight the people preyde and did great
worship to his modir that was called februa aftyr the which woman much
people have opinion that this moan that is callid februarij where fore the
secounde day of this moan is Candelmas day The Romans this night would goo a
boute the Cite of rome with torchis and candels bre^nyng in worship of this
woman Februa for hope to have the more help and socoure of her sone mars. Than
was there a (...) that was callid Sergius and when he saw Christian people draw
to this false maumentry and vn^^^ we believe he thought to undo this foul use
and custume and turn hit in to goddis worship and our ladies and yaffe
commandment that all christian people should come to church and offer up a
candell brennyng in the worship that they did to this woman februa and did
worship to our lady and to her sone our lord Ihesu Criste so that now this
feste is solemply hallowed through all cristendome and each christian man and woman
of couenable age to come to church and offer up her ca^dels as though they
were bodily with our lady hopyng for this reverence and worshipp^ that they do
to our lady to have a great reward in heaven and of her sone our lord ihesu*
criste and so they may be sekyr and hit be do in clean lyffe and with good
deuocione. A candell is made of weke and wexe So was cristis soul hid with
ynne the manhood. Also the fire be tokemith the god head Also hit be tokenithe
our lady modirhode and maydenhede light with the fire of love Also hit be
tokenith every christian man and woman that does good dedis with good entente and
perfect love and charity to god and to all christian people. where for if there
be any of you that his candell of charity be queynte goo a none and be a cordid
with his neybores and light his ca^dell and tha^ offer hit up fore that is
goddis will And if ye do not thus ye shall lose all your me rite and your
mede in heaven (...)

god kept them so that they had no harm.

Than for this* Judas was one of the xij. apostels and the nombre of he^ must
be fullfilled. than was criste steyed up in to heaven and the xi. apostles were
to gedyr with many other people in a place Thanne seyde Petyr to hem thus now
all good men and brethren hit is well know to you that Judas was one of the
xij. and be cause the no^bre may not be in perfeyte hit is needful to chese on
of these ij. men that has be with our lord chesu criste from the time that
he was baptisid in to the time of his asce^sione to bear wittenesse with us of
his vprysing and of his doing. Than they setten these ij. men Joseph barsabas
and mathie and leyde lotte upon hem and seyde thus preyng our lord O lord
thou knowist the hertis of all men show to us which thou che^i^te of these
ijj men and the lotte fill on mathie and so he was in nombre with the other xi.

Than mathie went in to mirre to preche word of god and fore he had the grace
of the holy ghost with him he did miracles and turned much people to the
feythe of criste Than was the fend sorry and aperyd to the Bishop of the
jews law in likeness of a young child with long heris and hoar and bad him
take mathie and do him to the death or else he would turn all the people to
cristus feythe Than the Bishop wexyd nyghe wode forwrathe and sent out
people to seek mathie and wha^ they had him they bound him his hondis be hynde
him and cast a rope about his neck and ladde him to prison and there bond
him fast with cheynes of iron Thanne the night aftir our lord ^hesu, C^riste
come to him with a great light and lousid his bondis and wha^ he had well
comfortid him he opened the prison door and bad him go preche the feythe and
spare for no man Than there as he p^chid there were sum that a yenestode him
and letid other y^ would have turned to the feythe Tha^ said mathie to hem I
tell you be for he shall fall down to hell pit. and so a none in sight of
all me^ the earth opened and they sanke down in to hell body and soul and
never was seyne more of hem. than was the people sore a gaste of that sight
and turned to the feythe a great nombre of hem Tha^ when the bishopp^ herd
there of they took him and bound him and set men to throw stones at him and
when he was nyghe de de he bad christian pleople to bear the stone that he was
stonedwith in to the grau with him in wittenesse of his martirdom^ and he
knelid down and held up his hondis to god and seyde O lord I be sech the take
my spirit and gafe up the ghost Reynold of chestre in his cronicles tellith a
nothir miracle like this and seythe. when seynte wolston visitid his
bishopp^riche the people brought a man be for him that did his neyboures much
disese and would never be in pese preyng the bishop to chastise him and when
the bishop had prechid this man he was ever longer the worse tho^ the bishop
and all the people preyde to seint mathie to show some miracle be this man what
he was worthy to have than ano^ in sight of all the people there come out of
the earth ij. fendes with brennyng hokes and pullid this quick man dou^e to

GOod friend is so che a day ye shall have an high and a sole mpne feste in
holy church the annu^ciacion of our lady and he that had a vowed or joined in
penance must fast the even ye shall understand that hit is callid the
annu^ciacion for this cause for the fadyr of heaven sent his angel Gabriell
Missus est an gelus gabriel a deo in cinitatem cui no men nazareth In to the
cite that was callid nazaret to our lady that was new wedded be the bidding
of god and reuelacion of the holy ghost to a man that callid Joseph and as she
was in her chamber in her prey ours the Angel gabriell come to her and seid
our lord i^ with the

Thanne was she greatly a stoyned of this greting for there was in that country
a man that cowde much which craft and so with help of fendes he made him
self like an Angel and come to diverse maydenes and said he was sent from
god to hem on his message and so often time lay by hem and did hem great vylony
Thanne when our lady herd tell of that man she was a drade left hit had be
he for she had spoke with none Angel be fore nor there were no soche wor^is ne
soche gretynges made never none to her be fore Tha^ Gabriell the Angel
comforted there and said. Ne time as maria in^e uisti graciam apud dominum.
Dread the not mary for sothe thou haste found grace of our lord for a mong
all wymmen our lord has chosyn the forto be the modir of his sone and him
thou shalt conceive be feythe and be love of the holy ghost with out any deed
of man that shall shadow the and quench all fleschly lust and tend the
light of gostely love that thou shalt conceive the sone of the high god. And
thus thou shalt be both modir and maid and so was never no^ before. Thanne a
none our lady herd this wordis a none there with come a spiritual
swettenesse and joy in her heart that a none or any erthly mo^ ^owde tell hit
and so with all the reverence of meke nesse that she cowde sche answered thus a
yene and seyde. Ecce aucilla domini fiat michi secundum uerbum tuum. Lo here
goddis own maid ready to do goddis will preyng hit may be to me right as thou
seyste. Thus that blessed body conceived our lord ihesu criste in ever lastyng
joy to all the world. Thus I may likyn our lady to a p^cious stone callid
enix and he is as clear as any criscall and shall of kind wha^ the son
shynythe hot on him hit openithe and received a drop of the dew of heaven in
to him and closithe a yene till.ix. months aftyr and thanne hit openithe and
fallithe out a sto^e of the same kind and so closithe a yene as ever hit was
and never openithe aftyr. Thus our lady was as clean as any cristall for the
hot love of the holy ghost at the ix. month is end she was delyueryd of her
sone our lord ihesu criste and she aftyr as clean meyden as she was to fore
Than when the Angel had done his message he went his wey to heaven and our
lady went to her cosyn elisabeth that was great with child with seinte Johan
Baptiste and who^ she come to Elisabethe she grette her mekely and as soon as
our lady spoke to Elisabeth the child in Elisabethes womb pleyde and made
great joy for^^ ^^we that our lord had take mankind and was come to save he
in that were lorne. Thann^ our lady dwellid therewith Elisabeth her cosyn till
the time yt seinte Johan was borne and was myddewyffe to eli sabeth and took
seint Johan from the earth and there she learned all that her ned id for to
know aye^ the time yt her sone should be borne and was persite y noughe there
of Tha^ mekely she took her leave and went home a give to Nasareth Than
thought Joseph he would go ^oke how his wyffe deed and went toward her and
when our lady herd of his coming sche went agayn^ him and great him full
mek^ly. But when joseph saw her great with child he meru^yled gretely how that
might be for well he wyste hit was not his fore he had never part of her
body in that degree fore he know well that she had made a vow before she would
never have part of man's body and thought how he was made to wedde her by the
byddyng of the holy ghost and great miracle showing and thought right in his
heart he was not worthy to dwell in her company and tho^ght in his heart to
have gone home aene and to leave her there Thene come an angel to him and said
be not aferd to take mari thy wife to thy keeping fore it is of the holy ghost
that is quick in her body for thou shall be her keeper and norse to her child
and when* hit is borne call it ihesus for he shall be savior to all the
world. Than ye shall understand that for iiij. causes as seynte Ambrose seyth
our lady was weddid to this old man Joseph The first was if she had
conceived with out wedloke the jews would have seid that she had be an evil
woman of her body and so have stoned her to death. The secou^de cause was fore
she was so shamefast that and she had herd any have put any defame to her
she would have dyede fore sorrow. The thrydde cause was for joseph should bear
wittenesse of her maydenhode The fourth cause fore joseph should help her at
her birth and bring her to bethleem and aftyr in to Egipte and so ayene in to
her own country fore these iiij. causes she was weddid to this old man Joseph
And also to be gyle the fend that he should not know him from a nothir*
child. Now have ye herd of the Annunciacion. There be sum people that ask
a question why there stondithe a wine pot with lyllyus between our lady and
Gabriell the Angel at her salutacion. This is the cause fore our lady at
her salutacion conceived be feythe



Hit be fill thus upon a cristemasse day that a christian man and ^ jew sat to
gedyr and spoke of the concepcion of o^re lady and as they were there stood a
wine pot to fore he in with a lyly there ynne Thanne said the christian man we
be leave that our lady conceived like as this lyly conceyuythe color of grene
and aftyr bryngi^h forth a white flower with out craft of man or any pay ryng
to the stalk right so our lady conceived of the holy ghost and aftyr
brought her sone our lord ihesu criste without any wemme of her body that is
flower and chief of all wymmen.

Thanne seyde the jew when I see a lyly spring out of the death stalk that
stondith in this pot thanne wolle I believe that thou seyste hit is true and a
none there with sprange a white lyly out of the deed stock that stood in that
same wine pot And when this Jew saw that a none he fill down un to the
ground upon his knees and seyde thus. lady now I see well that thowe
conceived with the holy ghost our lord Ihesu criste goddys sone of heaven And
thou were clean maiden both be fore the birthe and also aftyr the birthe And
so a none he was cristoned and so aftir he was a full holy man. And this is
the cause where so: that the pot with the lylyus is set between our lady
and the Angel for right as the jew disputid with the christian man of the
manner of the concepcion So our lady disputid with the Angel of the manner how
she should conceive and be both modir and maid or she consentid there to
Thanne ye that woll fast the v. eu^^ys of our lady in worship of her v.
joys that she had of her sone The first was when she conceived of the holy
ghost and know that sche was modir to goddis sone of heaven.

The secounde was on cristemasse day when she was delivered of her so ne with
out any pain of her body for as she conceived with out lust of her body
also she was delivered without pain of her body. The iij. joy was one Estyr
day when her sone rose from death to live and come to her and kyssed her and
made her more ioyefull of his ^prysing than she, was sorry of his death The
fourth joy was whann he^s^yed up to heaven on holy thurday in the same flesche
and blood that he took in her body The v joy was in her assumpcion when she
saw her sone come with great multitude of angelis and semtis to fette her to
heaven and crowned her queen of heaven and Emperes of hell and lady of the world
and so all that be in heaven shall do her reverence and worship and all bethe
in earth shall do her service

These be the v. joys that our lady had of her sone and ye shall
understood that he that woll great our lady with v. aueys shall never come in
to the pain of hell



we find wreton of an holy maiden that was devout in our lady service and
every day great her with v. joys Than hit happened so on a day that she fill
sike and felt her self well that sche should be deed and for fere she ^ighed
wonder sore and made great moan for be cause she wysce not whet^r she should go
afher death Thanne come our lady to her and seid why art thou so sorry y^ have
made me so often glad gretyng me with joys that I had of my sone there fore
be not sorry but know thou well that y^ shalt go with me in to ever lastyng
bliss and joy ever with out end



we find of seint Gilbert that one a time he was nigh deed of the quincy and
wha^ his throat was so great and w^ll nigh deed ^ he might uneath take brethe
our lady come to him and seyde to him gilbert my servant hit were evil do
that thy throat should suffer penance that has so oftyn times gladid me with
my joys and a none she took her feyre pappe and myl^yd on his throat and went
her wey and a none there with he was hole and thankyd our lady ever aftyr.

De sa^cto georgio martire.
GOod frendis soche a day ye shall have saint Gorges day the holy martyr hit is
wreton in his lyffe that there was an horrible dragon be side a Cite that was
callid Cirme of the which dragon me^ of the Cite were sore a ferde in so much
that be counsel of the king every day they gaffe him a child and a sheep to
ete fore fere left he would have come in to the Cite Than when all the
children and shep were nigh eton for because that the king him self gaffe hem
that same counsel they constreyned him that had but a daughter to give her to
the dragon Than the king for fere of the people with weeping and great sorrow
making delivered hem his child and sent her forth in to the place there as
they were wont to set te her own children and a sheep with her to a bide till
the dragon come.

But than by the ordinance of god seint iorge come rydyng that wey and when he
saw this damysell in her array him thought she was a woman of great birthe and
asked her why she stood there with that sheep in soche ^ray fo morning Thanne
answered sche and seyde gentill knight well may I morn and make sorrow for I
am a kings daughter of this Cite And now am I set here to be devoured of a
dragon that had eto^ all the children of this cite and be now distroied and
now he must have me for my fadre gaffe he^ counsel there to and therefore
getyll knight ride hense fast and save thy self left the dragon slay both
the and me Tha^ seide gorge damysell that were great shame and vy lony to me
that I am a knight well arayde and should fle and thou a woman and should a
bide Than with that the dragon put out his head at an hole and spitte fire
and proffered battle to gorge A none Gorge made a sign of the cross be fore
him and set his spear in gate and with great might bare down the dragon to
the ground and than he bad the damysell bind this dragon with her gir dell a
boute the neck and led him with her in to the cite and so the dragon followed
aftyr her as it had be an hounde made for to bow patiently

But when the people of the cite saw this dragon come they flede for fere a
wey Thanne gorge callid the people a yene and seyde to hem be not a ferde for
and ye woll be leave in criste and take cristendome I wolle save ^ew and ^^e
this dragon and delyuere you of your enmy Thanne where they so glad that a
none.xx. thousand men without wymmen and children were cristonyd and the ^^^g
and the queen were surs^e of all with all his ^usholde and than Gorge slew the
dragon and bad the people tey oxon unto him and draw him out of the that the
sauer of him did the people no harm Than gorge bad the king edify and bilde
churches in each cornere of his land and be lusty to goddis service and to
honor and worship to all people of holy church and ever have and
compassion and be sorry for hem that be pore and nedy and be in any dissese
Thane when gorge had done thus and had turned all the lord to christian feythe
he he^de of an Emperor that highte Dioclesian how he did many christian me^ to
death than he went to him and rebu^rd him of his cursid de dis. Than the
Emperor a none commaundid to put Gorge into prison and to ley him vprighte
and to ley a my stone on the breast to press him to death. Then Gorge preyde
t^ god for help and our lord kept him that he hadd no harm in no part of
his body And when the emperor herd there of he ded make to whelis and set
hem full of hokys and Gorge was set in the myddys between the^ ij. and than
the whelie were turned and so to race his flesche from the bones and when
Gorge was in this tourment a none he preyde to god of so coure and help and
anon he was holpyn And than they put him in to an hot lyme kylle and closid
him there in for he should have be burnt But a none our lord turned hit in
to cold and there in he was iij. days and tha^ they wend to have found him
all to burnt and he was save from all manner harms and was merry. Than he was
brought forth and set before the Emperor and Gorge repreuyd him of his
false goddis and seyde they were but fe^des with out might and power Than the
Emperor to beat his mouth with stones till he was to powned and made to beat
his bare body with dry besomes till the flesche fille from the bones and the
people might have seyne his guttis yet aftyr y^ they made him to drunk venym
that was made strong for the nonys for to have peyned him to death. And when
Gorge had made a syne of the cross he dra^ke the poison with out grieve in
so much that the man that made the poison turned to Christian feythe and a non
he was do to death Thanne the night aftyr as Gorge was in prison preyng* god
come to him and seyde Gorge be of good comfort to morrow thou shalt make an
end and come to ever lastyng joy and bliss and set a crown on his head
and gafe him his blessyng.

Than on the morew for he would not do worshipp^ to the false goddis the
Emperor made to smite of his head and than as the Emperor would have go to
his paleyse there come a fire lyghtening and burned him and all his people.

we find a scory of antioche wreton that be side iherusalem a fayrt young
knight apperid to a priest and seyde I am seint Gorge and a leder of christian
people and commanded the priest he should bear with him his relikes and come
with him to the siege of the rusalem But when they come to the walls of the
rusalem the he thyn people there ynn were so strong that the christian not
durst come to the walls. Than come seint Gorge clothid in white and made a
cross on his breast and went upon the ladder and badde the christian people
come aftyr him And so with the help of seint Gorge they got the Cite of ihe
rusalem and slew all the he thyn people that were found there. and there fore
late v^ prey to seint Gorge to help us a yense our go stely enmy new and ever

and took marks body and beried hit Than fill hit so that every christian land
hallowed seint marks day save one country that is callid appolonia the which
country was so greuyd with he^e and drowthe that all the country failed hem of
fruit so that they were well nere famelyd And tha^ there come a voice from
heaven and bad hem halowe seint marks day and than they schulde be comfortid
and they deed so and a no^ god sent hem ple^te of all manner of frutesy now.

Now hit is to wete why we schulde fast this day and go in precession.

we read in the cite of rome one this day fill soche a qualme and a sodeyn death
that when a man yaned or gapid or fuesid a no^ he dyede and there dyede many
suddenly. Thanne was there a pope was callid Pellagius that commaundid all
christian people that when he yaned every man schulde make a cross over his
mouth And when any man her de a nothir fuese he schulde sey criste help the.
and so many were saved. and there he made the people go a procession and so
preyng to all the semty^ of heaven to prey to god for hem and so they deed Tho^
come aftyr seint Grego ry and made hem do the same on seinte marks day to
halowe and fast and go in procession and canoni^ed hit to be done for ever
more than come there a pope yt was callid Liberius in his time all manner frutis
in this time of the year of great tendirnesse of hit self took great harm so
what by thoundyr lightenyng and unkind hete^ by stormys mildewes by worms and
by long tayled fleyes for vengeance that a none aftyr Estyr day the people
turned a yene to her old sin having no reward of the sacrament which they
have receyned and there fore god sent more vengeance this time than in any
other time of the year. where fore this holy (...) to put a wey all these
things and in special goddis wrethe fro the people he co^mau^did to all
christian people to halowe and to fast and go in procession and he that seyde
that hit is made be a co^stitucion is a cursed till he come to amendment And
there for I charge you and counsel you all that thynkith to be saved keep
this day aftyr the rewle of holy church

In die philippi ^ iacobi.
GOod frendis soche a day ye shall have the feste of philippe and jacob the
which were holy apostles. But for this feste comith with ynne feste of Estyr
ye shall not fast the even but ye shall come to church to worship god and
the holy apostles Tha^ ye shall know well that philippe was ordained by all
other apostles to goo in to country that was callid Sithia to preche to the
vnbeleued people. But when he come the dir and prechid and yene the maumentes
preuing that they were fendes and no goddis and so they took him and ladde him
to her temple and would have constreyned him to have do sacrifice. Than as they
were besy to do him dissese suddenly a great dragon come out of the ^^ the and
slew iij. of this miss believed people and venemed so the people with his
brethyng that there f^ll on hem soche a sikenesse that the woe and the sorrow
that they had they cride aftyr help. Than seyde philipp^ to hem if ye woll
be helped and helid of your sikenes and also these men reaid from death to live
Furste cast down the maumentes and set in her stead crossis like to the
cross there as our lord dyed upon and do hit worshipp^ Thann they deed so for
they were glad to be holpyn of her sikenesse and as soon as they had do so they
were holpyn And than philipp^ preyde to god for the iij. men to rise from death
to live Tunc precepit phillippus draconi vt in locum suu^ redescenderet Thanne
philippe commaundid the dragon to go down to his place a yene and never
dissese man more. Than the cursed people of the Cite saw that philippe would
have turned all the people and took him and did him upon a cross and so on a
cross he dyed and went to ever lasting bliss Amen.

Now shall ye here of Jacob that was callid among the apostles Iacobus minor
the less ^ames for to know from Iacobus mayor James the more that was seint
johan Euangeliste brothir But when jacobus or james that is all one name this
man was callid cristus own brothir for he was so much like to criste Than
wha^ the jews would have take criste they cowde not know on from a nothir but
as judas betrayed Criste with kyssyng of him and by that kyssing criste was
known and takyn This james was so holy from the time that he was borne as

This was the first man that ever song miss in vestymentes as prestes does
no^^ Than hit fill so that time in t^^ Cite o^ ^herus^lem with synn of c^istu^
^^ the that hit must nedis be (...)yed where fore (...) holy man Ieme was made
bishop of the cite ^^ ^he rusalem and there he was left to preche and to turn
the people to better leuyng but fore they were so combered with sin that they
had none other grace of a mendement but nedely for the prophecye of criste
must be fullfilled and the cite distroyed where for these men took seint^
Ia^^s and sett^ him one an high place p^eyng him to (...) the (...) of crist^
(...) (...) ^he people ^^^ ^^^rned to crist And ^^ stood up and preched by good
re^on how all th^^ ^^ leuyd not in criste should be dampened at the day of dome
in to hell pit Than the maiscre of the jews bad thrasce him down from the
high^ place that he stood ^nn^ and with stones they ^e^e hy^ down till he ^^s
deed. Than he knelid on his knees preyng to god for give hem his death ^ there
with a cursed ma with a s(...) smote him one the head that ^^e beayne fill
out. and so in this wise he gaffe up the ghost Thanne aftyr fore vengeance of
crist us death and fore this holy manues death the cite of iherusalem that was
y^ time the gretest Cite of the world and never like to have be won sone
aftyr was distroyed in to the vtermeste in so much that every stone m every
wall was turned up so down as criste seyde xl. winter be fore that hit should
be so and hit was And the jews were dreuyn out in to diverse countries in so
much that all the kingdoms were distroyed and yet be under other kings and
ever shall be sogettes and no possessoures. yet ye shall he re more of the
destruction of this Cite of iherusalem to show how vengeable god is to hem that
be glad to shede cris^en me^nes blood as they we^e ^hanne god would have (...)
^gea^nce of Cite. ^it happid so that a man of pilatus the which did criste to
death come from iherusalem toward rome but the tempeste in the sea took him
and drove him upon a land by a temple with great tempeste. And there dwelled
a great lord that was callid Daspasian And for this cause he was callid fore he
had soche a maladye in his nostreiles there droppid out of his nose worms
like waspes Thanne seyde Daspasian to this man from what country comyste thou
and he answered him and seyde from iherusalem and woll toward Rome. Thanne
seyde Daspas^an I am glad there of sore I have herd sey that there be many
go^d leches in that country. where fore I would well thou cowdis^e hele me.
And but if thowe do not he le me thou shalt be deed Tha^ answered he and
seyde I am no leche my self but he that he lithe all sike and reysithe the
deed to live he may he le the and ^f that hit be his will how is that said
vaspasian Sire seyde he ihesu of nasareth that the jews have slain And if
thou wolte believe in him thou shalt have all that thou wolte desire and be
hole Than seyde vaspasian I believe verily as thou seyst that he may hele me
that reysithe men from death to l^ffe and anon with that word he was hole. Than
was he glad that he was hole Tha^ a none he sent a man to the empe^rour of
rome and gate license and leave to distroy the cite of iherusalem and than he
gaderid a great multitude of people and Titus that was his own sone with him
and went to iherusalem Than in the mean while that he besegid the cite the
Emperor dyed and than was he chosyn Emperor and turned a yene to rome and
left Titus his sone there to distroye the Cite

Than Titus lay so fore to the cite that he enfamylde hem in so much that the
eton her schon and her botis and the fadir took mete from the sone and the sone
from the fadir and eythir took hit from otheris mouth the husbo^de from the
wyffe the wyff from the husbonde Tha^ among all other there was a woman of
great birthe and was come of gentill blood and had a young child and fore
hungir she seyde my dear child I have suffered much more pain for the than
ever thou dediste for me where for her is more reason that I ese my hunger on
the Tha^ though I dye and thowe both and so took her child and slew hit and
rostyd half of hit and kept half till on the morrow And than as the flesche
rosty^ the sauoure went in to the Cite and when the people felt the sauoure
they wend there had be plente of mete and come in to have had part and than
this woman would have hid hit. but they seyde they would se what mete she
had And tha^ she brought hit forth and shewde hit and seyde lo here I have
rostyd my own child and here is that other half a yense to morrow. Tha^ the
people were sore a gresid there of and all a mased of that sight and went
forth leuyng the woman etyng of her child Than hunger encresid so gretely
that there dyed with ynne the cite so thike that they cast the bodies over the
walls out of the cite in to the dikes and so filled the dikes full of deed
bodies and the stynke smote forth in to the country and enfectid the people
greatly Than so at the last great need made hem to yield up the cite Than titus
went in with his oste and right as the jews sold crist: for xxx. penyes so
they sold xxx. jews fore a penny and turned the cite up so down in so much
the y left not estone stondyng upon a nothir but distroied hit to the
vtermeste part Jo thus may ye se though that god almighty a bide and suffer
long he smyth sore at the last and takith great vengeance on hem that be
lusty to shede christian men's blood where for every christian man and woman a
mende hem self preyng to this holy apostles to be mediatoures between god and
hem that they may have verray repentance here in her hertis with shrift of
mouth and sassaction in deed doing that we may come to the bliss that never
shall have endyng Amen.

De inuencione sa^rte cruris.
^Ood frendis so (...)ht a day ye shall (...) have the inuenci(...) the holy
cross but ye shall not fast the even but come to god and to holy church as
criste^ people should do in worship of him that dyed on the cross Than ye shall
understand why it is callid Inue^cio erucis. the fyndyng of the cross the
which was found in this wise as I shall tell you when Adam our furste fadir
was sike for old and would feign have be out of this world Adam sent seth
his sone to the angel keeper of paradyse p^yng the angel to send him the oil
of mercy to anoynte his body with when he were deed Tha^ went seth to paradyse
and seyde his message to the angel Than answered the angel and seyde that he
might not have hit tille the yeris be fullfillid but have this branche of the
tree that thy fadir sinned ynne and serce hit one his grave and when hit berithe
fruit thann shall he have mercy and not erste Tha^ took seth this branche and
come home and found his fadir deed Than he set this branche on his fade r^s
grave as the a^gell bad him do the which branche goowed there till solomon was
king and he made fell hit down for hit was fair to the work of his temple But
hit would not cord with the work of his temple Salamon made to cast hit
down in to the earth and was hit hid there in time that the bishop of the
temple let make a wayre in the same place there the tree lay to wess^ in sheep
that were offered in the temple Than when this wayr was made they callid hit in
their langage Probatica piscina in the which watyr every day come an angel
from heaven and did worship to the ^tre that lay in the ground of the weyre and
meuyd the watyr and what man or woman that come in to the watyr next aftyr the
angel was made hole what sikenes that ever he had be virtue of the tree and so
endured many wyntres in to the time that criste was takyn and should be done
one the cross Than this tree by the ordenau^ce of god swa^ upon the watyr and
when the jews had none other tree ready to make the cross of fore great haste
that they had they took the same tree and made there of a cross and so did
our lord there on and than that tree bare that blessid fruit cristus own
body of the which wellith the Oil of mercy to Adam and to Eve and all other
of her of spryng But when crist was deed and was take down of the cross for
envy that the jews had to him they took the cross and to ij. other crosses
that the thefes were hong^d^ on eythyr side of criste and beried he m^depe in
the earth for criston people should not wete where y^ they were done for to do
hit worship And there it lay a year and more in to the time that Elene the
Emperes modir of constantyne gaderid great people to fight with maxencius at a
great watyuouer the which watye lay a great brigge for disceyte of conscantyne
maxencius let make a trappe hoppyng up and down so for to have disceyued
Constantyne that he should have fallyn in to the watyr and as Constantyne lay
in his b^d sore a ferde of maxencius for he was much bigger of people than he
was. than come to him an angel with a sign^ of the cross sheytrnyn^^s gold
and seyde to him* to morrow whannethon ghost to the battle take this sign in
thy hand and by the virtue there of thou shall have victon Thanne was
constantyne woundir glad and anon let make a Cross of the tree and to bear hit
to fore he^ to the battle But wha^ maxencius saw him nyghe the brigge he was
so feres of him self that he had for get the trappe the which he had made
him self and so come one the brigge and fill down in to the watyr by the
trappe and was drowned Tha^ was all his often woundir feign to yield hem to
co^stantyne with good will Than for Constantyne was not yet cristoned of him
and also he was helid of a leper that he had Than a none be counsel of the
pope he sent his modir queen Elene that was queen of iherusalem ^ preyde her
to go and seek the cross there crist dyed on. This Elene was a kings daughter
of England and the Emperor of rome weddid her for her beute and so she was
made emperes of rome But aftyr lxr husbondes death she had the kygdome of
iherusale^ to dowry where she made gadir all Jews that might be found and
seyde but if they would show her the cross they should all be burnt Tha^ was
there on of hem that highte judas and all seyde yt he knew best where the
cross was. Than seyde Elene to him. Si vis ninere ostende michi lignum crucia.
if thou would leu^ show me the cross that god dyed upon or else thou shalt
be burnt and so putt^ him to great distress.

Than he saw he mustened is tell or dye and seid to hem I be seche you let me
to the mount of Caluary there as I shall bide you and I shall show you the
cross of Criste for he was blind and might not se And so wha^ he was
brought to the mou^te of caluary he knelid down and preyde long and when he
had preyde the place there the ^rosse was menyd and the earth quoke and there
come a sweet sauore from that place there the cross lay that was as sweet as
any spicery in the world. And than they diggid there long and at the last
they found there iij. crosses but tha^ wuste they notte which was cristus
cross from y^ other ij. And than took they a deed body and leyde hit now on
that cross and now on that other and wha^ hit come to cristus cross a none
the body rose to live and thankyd god Tha^ seyde this judas Thowe art criste
trewly and savior of all the world And aftyr that judas was cristoned a none
and was an holy man aftyr. Than took Elene a part of y^ cross and send hit
to rome to her sone and the remena^ te there of she made to shryne hit in
silver and gold and left hit in iherusale^ with all the worship y^ she
cowde thus holy church makithe mind this day that the holy cross was found
Than as we read we find in a cite that was callid Birectus a christian man hired
an house of a jew to dwell in Than had this man a rode the which
nichodemus had made in mind of criste. Than took he this rode and set hit up
in a p^uy place of his house for sight of the jews and did hit worship
aftyr his connyng Than aftyr h^it fill so that this man went in to a nothir
house and happid him to leave this ^ode be hynde him vnwetyng. Than come the
jew and dwellid in the house there this christian man had be ynne. Than for to
make him good chere his neyboures come on a night and souped with him and as
they satyn at souper and spoke of this christian man that dwellid there be for
this jew ^okyd be side him and in a corner he saw this ^^^e and when he saw
that a none he be gone to grynde with his teth and to chyde with this other
jew his neybour and seyde thou art turned to christian feythe and haste a rode
and doste h^it worshipp^ preuely Than this other jew swore nay as deep as he
cowde that hit was not so ne never saw hit be fore that time yet not with
stonding that other jew yede and told his neyboures and seyde that this man
was a preuy christian man and had a rode preuely in his house Than anon come all
his mybo^^^^ wode forwrothe and all to bet this man and drew him and togged
him in the worste manner that they cowde and so at the last they seyde all this
is the image that thou beleuest upon And they took the image and beat hit and
scorged hit and crowned hit with thorns and at the last they made the
strongist of h^e^ to take aspere and with all his might to smyghte him to the
heart and a non there with blood and watyr ran out by the sides than were
they sore a ferde there of and seyde take we pottes and fill hem with this
blood and late ve bear hit in to the temple there as all the sike people is of
diverse malodyes and anoint hem there with and if they be hole with the blood
than cry we god mercy and a none lets us be cristoned man and ^om^ Than they a
ny^ted the sike people with this blood and a none they were hole than went
these jews to the Bishop of the Cite and told him all the cause and a none
he kn^lid down on his knees and thankyd god of his fair miracle. And when he
cristoned the jews he took violis of glass cristall and ambour and put of
this blood in hem and sent it a bowte in diverse chirches and of this blood
as many man vndersto^dith rome to the blood of hayled Milites tellith in his
cronicles that many yeris aftyr that iherusalem was distroyed the jews would
have bildid hit a yene thann as they went the their wards erly in a morrow they
found many crosses by the wey and they were a ferde there of and turned
homewardes a yene yet on the morrow they come a yene thanne were there crosses
full of blood and than they flight homewardes a yene echone yet would they not
leave there by but comes yene the iij. day than ^^^ rose out of the earth and
burnt hem euerycho^^ in to asks.

De festo sancti is hannis ante portalatinam
GOod frendis soche a day ye shall have seint iohan^ day at port latyne why is
this day callid so ye shall here. Hit happi^ as this day this holy seinte
prechid the word of god in a Cite that was callid ephesie the iusti^ of the
cite saw that he turned much people to the believe of Criste and would have
had him to do sacrifice to his false goddis and for he would not but rathir
lyse h^is lyffe. thanne this justice let take him and co^mau^ did him to be
set in p^son while he sent to the Emperor of Rome to wete what he should
do to him and when his letteres were come to the Emperor in the which
letteres he callid Johan all the worste that he could and said h^e was a false
disceyuer of th^e people thanne wrote the Emperor a yene to th^e justice and
bad he should send Johan a yen to him to Rome and so he did

And the Emperor apposed him o^ his dedis and johan stood stedfast^ in the
feythe and fore great skorne the emperor made clippe of sum of iohans here
of his head fore he had a fair head of here And when he was so clippid all the
people laughed him to skorne and so did him great dissese

And they ladde him to a yate of the town of rome the which is callid port
latyne and there they put him in to a tonne of fervent hot oil and closid
him there ynne and put under fire to have burnt him there in But for he was
goddis own derlyng he kept him so that he had no harm in no part of his
body tha^ when the people went y^ he had be deed they unclosed the tonne and
found him as hole and as found in all the partis of his body and clothis as
no thing had touchid him there for christian people let make a church there in
the worship of god and martyrdom that suffered there Than fore the Emperor
might not over come him by no wey of martyrdom nor penaun he exiled him in to
an isle that is callid pathmos Than herd seint johannes modir that her sone was
sent to rome fore to be deed for great sorrow and compassion of him sch^ went
aftyr to rome but whann she herd that he was exiled she turned a yene and
went home ward ^^d ^^ w^an s^^ come to a cite that was callid ^etu^am and
there she fill sike and dyed and there she was heryed be sides the cite in a
roge and when she had l^yne there many yery^ semte James her other sone come
thedir and took up his moderis body and hit smellid as sweet as any spiceey and
brought hit in to the cite and beried hit there with great worship and
honor. Amen

De festo sa^cti iobannis baptiste
GOod frendis soche a day ye shall have an high feste and an holy that is
callid seint iohans day the baptiste and is callid so for he baptized criste in
the watyr of flom Jordan where fore ye shall fast the even. And ye shall
understood and know how the euenys were first found in old time in the
beginning of holy church hit was so that the people come to church with cande
les brennyng and would wake and come with light to wards night to the church
in her deuocions and aftyr they fill to lecheery and songs dau^ces harpyng and
also fill to glotony and sin and so turned the holiness in to cursednesse
where fore holy faderis ordained the people to leave yt wakyng and to fast the
even and thus turned the wakyng in to fasting. But hit is callid vigilia that
is wakyng in English and yet hit is callid the even for at the euyne they were
wont to come to church But in worshipp^ of seinte johan the people woke at
home and made iij. manner of fyres on was clean bones and no wode and that is
callid a bone fire A nothir is clean wode and no bones and that is callid a
wode fire fore people to fit and to wake there by The thridde is made of wode
and bones and that is callid seint johan fire The first fire as a great
clercke Johan bellet tellith was in a certain country for in the country was
so great hete the which causithe the dragons go to gedyr in tokenyng that
Johan dyed in brennyng lone ^ charity to god and man. And they that dyen in
charity schalle have part of all good preyoures and they that do not schall
never be saved Than as this drago^s fleith in the air they shed down to the
wateres frothe of her kind and so enuenymed the wateres and causithe much
people to take her death there by and many diverse sikenesse Than on a time there
were many great clerkys and radde of king alisa ^der how on a time as he should
have a battle with the king of Inde and this king of inde brought with him
many olyfauntes beryng casteles of tree one her backs as the kynne of hem is to
have knights armed in the castle fore the battle Thanne knew alisau^dre the
kind of the olyfauntes that they drad no thing so much as the ^arryng of
swynne where for he made gadre to gedir all the swyne yt might be goton and
caused hem to be dreuyn as nigh the oly^au^tes as they might well here the
iarryng of the swyne and thann they made a pigge to cry and when the swynes
herd the pigge cry a none they made a great iarryng and as soon as the
olyfauntes herd that they began to fle each on and cast down the castellis
and slew the knights that were in he^ and by this mean Alisaundre had the
victory in this wise. Also these wise clerkys knew well that dragons hatith no
thing more than the s^enche of brennyng bones. there for they gaderid so many
as they might find and bre^de hem and so with the ^tenche there of they drove
awey the dragons and so they were brought out of great dissese. The secounde
fire was made of wode for that woll brenne light and woll be seyne far fore
hit is the chief of fire to be seyn fe^re in tokenyng that seint johan was a
lantern of light to the people. Also the people made blasis of fire fore they
should be seyne fer and specially in the night. Semt jeremy the prophet many a
yeris or johan was born he prophesied and spoke thus with godd is mouth and
^eyde. Pri^squam te for ma^^ in vtero no ^i ^e Before or thou were formed in
thy moderis womb I knew the Et antequa exires de uulua sanctifica ^^te. And
before or thou yodeste out of thy moderis womb I hallowed the Et prophe tam in
gentibus de dite And I gaffe the ^ prophet to the people Than for seint ioha^
should be holy or he were borne ged sent his Angel gabriell to sacary seint
iohans fadir as he did sacrifice instead of abia the bishopp^ in the temple
and preyde to god to have a child for both he and his wyffe were bareyne and
old Than seyde the angel to sacary Ne time as ^acarie Dread the not zacarye
god has herd thy preyour. Elisabeth u^or t^^ pariet filiu^ et ^ocabi tur
nom^ eius iobe^s elizabeth thy wyffe shall have a child and his name shall be
callid johan he shall be fullfillid with the holy goset. Et multi in
n^ti^itate eius gaudebunt And many shall joy in the birth of him than for
zacarye was old he preyde the angel to have a tokyn of his he hefte than said
the angel to him he should be dome till the child were borne and so he was.
than c^nceyned elisabeth and whann she was quick with child our lady come
with child also to speak with Elisabeth and a none as she spoke to Elisabeth
semt johan pleyde in his moderis womb for joy of cristus p^sence that he saw
in our lady And so there our lady was with Elizabeth un to the time that
Johan was borne and was myd dewyffe to elisabeth and took seint johan from the
earth and when neyboures herd that elisabeth had a sone they were full glad and
come thedir as the manner was that time to give the child a name and called hit
zacary aftyr the fadir but elisabeth badde call him johan But for there was
none of the kynn of that name they asked zacary be signs what the child
should hight. Tha^ be wrote to hem and badde call him Johan. And there with god
lousid zakaries tongue and spoke redely and thankyd god highly Thus was johan
holy or he was borne And fore he would give every man sight of grace and of
good leuyng he gaffe him ensample for as soon as he was of couenable age he
went in to deserte and was there till our lord come to be cristoned of him and
there he le ^yd full streytely. Johannes uero habu^t uestimenta de pili^
camelo^^m. Johan has his clothe made of the here of camel and a gyrdyll
about him of the same skin. Es^a autem eius erat locusta et mel siluestre
For fothe his mete was leuys and soke honey of leuys that the manner is like a
white flower that growith in trees And he ete all manner of worms that were
norisched in that deserte among her bis and the worms be as great as a man's
finger and sokith honey of flowers that be callid honey soke lys that pore people
gaderithe and fryen in oil to her mete Also johan ete broad round leaves that
growyn in trees in that deserte And when they be brokyn between a man's hondes
they be sweet as honey And he drank watyr of a well that was in that deserte
This ^asiohans lyffe in that deserte till that our lord was xxx* winter of
age. And th^n o^^ lord and johan met at the watyr of flom jordan and than
johan told ^he people of criste and seyde ^^^e a(...)nu^ dei Se the lombe of

he suffe^^d the woundis for us that bethe the v. wells of mercy that he
suffered for us ye shall understood that these ij. apostles were furste great
sinners.

But for they left her sin and were sorry and contrite and sinned no more our

For he that is shreuyn and for sakith his sin mercy folowith that. and do his
penance and he shall have mercy and grace For as glad as the ^adir is to se

that woll fore sake her sin ye shall understood that pou^e was furste so
high and so ferse a yense all goddis servants that there durst no p^chour
dele with him but aftyr he left that great malice and there as he was ferse
aftyr he was gracious. And there he was be fore high and proud of heart aftyr
he was meke and lowly to all goddis servants. Petyr also held him self
most perf^te and steadfast of all cristus disciples where for he made boste by
a vain glory that he was ready to go to death with criste and seyde thus Hit be
houit me to dye with the and whann Criste seyde that all his disciples should
fore sake him Petyr for the great boste seyde though all men for soke him he
would not. And yet more over when criste was take Petyr drowe out his sword
and smote of a servants ere that hight mal cus But sone aftyr wha^ he saw
that criste was take and should be put to^e the tha^ he swear and starid that
he never know him and for soke criste but wha^ he herd the cock crawe than he

bitterly and hid him in a cave and durst not come among his brethe ryn foe
schame ti^^ once lord sent to him by name Than was petyr ever aftyr a shamed
and sorry for his tr^space. and there as he was a boster and unstable of his
wordis aftyrwarde he was true and stable and groundid in stabelnesse of perfect
leuyng in so much that crist callid him Petyr that i^ a stone in english For
there as thou leyeste a stone there thou shalt find hit so was petyr so sted
fast aftyr that nethir for well nor for woo he never fle tered but ever stood
stead fast in cristus law and had ever his synn in mind and to a mende that
he had do a mysse and was aftyr of great abstinaunce that he ete but bread and
oil wortes and full seldom flesche and wered but a singull kyrtell with a

he be gonne to weep full sore. And when he herd any cokke crow a none he rose
up and would goo and prey and suffer penance and he wept many times so
bitterly that the teris of his eyes burnt his face in so much that were he
was he had a clothe in his bosom all wey to wype a wey the teris.

Thanne so following he was so holy that where that ever he went and he might
schadowe any syke body a non they were hole So on a time he sent ij. of his
disciples in to a far country to preche and when they were go ij. days
journey one of he^ dyed and that other turned a y^ne and told Petyr. Thanne
petyr t^ke him his staff and bad him ley the staff on his fellow and bad him a
rise in the name of god and he rose a none and went forth to gedyr and p^chid
Than were many wroth that petyr turned so much people to the feythe and
put him in to prison and bond him fast with great ^heynes of ^ro^ till he

come the fendeeleme that was callid symond mague that cowde much of ^he fendes
craft and made much people sike in diverse sikenesse some blind sum lame
sum death so that the people what fore fere and for wondyr believed in him.

Thanne petyr helyd all tho that magus had hurt and bad they should not be
lene in him than was this symond magus wroth with Petyr that he might not ^aue
his will and in special he might not reyse a death body to ly*ue that petyr

GOod (...) ^^ ch^ a day ye shall have the ^este of mary M^w deleyn that was so
holy that Our^ lord ^he ^^ cri^^e loved her best of all (...) next his own
modir. where (...) ye shall^ come to god and to holy churthe and prey to that
holy woman that she woll prey to our lord for us that we may have grace. fore
she was the furste in time of grace that did penance for she had lost grace
be fleschly lust where for she is made a mirror to all other syuers that woll
for sake sin and do penance they shall have grace the which was lost by
sin. She had a fadir that was a great lord and nigh of the kings blood and
had a great lordshippe in iherusalem the which he gaffe to lazarus his sone
and he gaffe mary the castle of maudeleyn with all the lordshippe longyng
there to. of the which castle she had her name and was callid Mary mawdeleyn
for sche was lady there of. Than as many bokys seyne saint ichan evangelist
weddid her and our lord bad him go with him and hepe his virginite and so he
did and was clean virgin. And than mawdeleyne went forth and gaffe her all
to sin in so much sche lost the name of mawdeleyne and was callid the
sinful woman But hit was oftyn seyn that our lord made of the grettyste
sinners the hoolyeste aftyrwardes and so when our lord saw time he gaffe
this woman grace to know her self and to have repentannce for her sins Than
when mary herd that criste was at a man's house that was callid Simon the
pharise sche took a box with oyneme^t soche as the people vsid that time for
hete of the son and went thethir but she durst not for schame go to fore
him but at his fete be hynde him and hard him speak and thann sche took a
great soww in her heart and wept tenderly and so with the teris of her eyes
sche wosche cristus fete. and with the here of her head sche wyped hem and with
all the love of her heart she kyssid he^ and a noynted hem but no word she
spoke that any man might here but softely in her heart she cride mercy and made
a vow to him that she would never trespace more. Tha^ our lord ihesu had pire
on her and cast out of her vij. fendes and for gaffe her all her sins in
heryng of all that there were. tha^ she took soche a love to criste that she
left all he lordshippis the castle of maudeleyn with all other goodis and
sewid him for the with great love that in his passion there as his disciples
fley a wey from him she left him never till she with help of other had leyde
him in his tomb And when no man durst goo thedir for the knights that kept
him she spared not Cumtenebre esse^t when hit was myrke in the dawnyng sche
took with her sweet bawmes to a noynte cristus body with thus she shewid soue
both in will and deed where for criste in his live for her love he lid martha
her sustre of the read flixe that she had vij. year to fore and pyned her full
sore Et resuscitauit lazarum a mortuia and resid lazar her brothir from death
to lyffe that had ley iiij. days stynkyng in his grave And when our lord rose
from death to lyffe he apperyd to her and suffered her to touch him and kiss
his fete. Than when hit was knowyn to the jews that criste shewde her so many
tokenes of lone for all other Than when criste was styed up to heaven the jews
took mary and martha her sustre lazarus maxencius and many other and put hem in
a ship that was old into the sea to have drowned hem. but god ordained so
for ^ll things at his will and brought hem save to a lord callid mercyzle
and there they restid under a ba^ke that was nyghe the temple Than mary saw
much people coming toward the temple to do sacrifice to her mowmentes and the
lord of the country come with hem but mawdelyn was gracious and with her
gracious words turned hem a yene. Than this lord had great lust to here her
speak and seyde thus to her that if god that thou spekist of be so gracious and
so great of power as thou seyst prey to him that I may have a child be my
wyffe that is bareyne and thanne woll I believe in him. Thann mary seyde sche
would and with in short time aftyr the lady conceived and was with child.
Than this lord a none aftyr ordained to go to iherusale^ to petyr to wete of
him whethir mawdeleynes prechyng were true or no and vitaylid his ship and
made him ready. Than come his lady ^yng him that she might go with him so with
great preyour the lord grau^tid her than by assent of hem both they made mary
maudeleyn to keep all her lordshippes and goodis that they had and mary serte
a cross on eythir of her shuldres and bad hem go in the name of god so when
they had seyled a day and a night a great te^peste rose in so much that they
went all to have be drowned Than was iady so a ferde and there with be gonne
to travail and so was delivered of a man child and she in the birthe fill
down deed Thanne this lord made great sorrow and lamentacione and seyde Alas
alas y wreche what shall I do with this child now is the modir deed and nedis
must the child dye also fore here is no womannes help to keep it Than he
cryde to mawdelyn and seyde a las mary why do thou thus to me thou be
highteste me a child and now is the modir deed and the child must nedis dye
for fault of womannes help. And y my self look ever wha^ I shall be drowned
help mary and have compassion on me and of my child Than seyde the shipman
cast this body into the sea for we shall never have rest while hit is in the
ship. Than seyde the lord she is not deed but light in a sown fore fere
But I prey you let us have the ship^ to yon dir roche for I had lever grave
her there tha^ to cast her in to the water. and for there was none earth to make
her a grave he left her hongyng on the roch of stone and the child be the modir
and covered he^ with his mantell and be took he^ to god and mary mawdedeleyn to
keep and went his wey. So when he come to ^hrlm^ he spoke with petyr and he
bad him be of good comfort though his wyffe were deed for god might restore
hem to live a yene. Than Petyr shewde him the places as our lord was quick
and deed and told him of his birthe and of his passione and of his
resurrection and his ascension and informed him of the feythe and made him
stedefaste to criste And when he had be there ij year petyr sent him home a
yene and bad him great well mawdeleyn and her feloshipp^ Than wha^ the lord
come far in to the sea and saw the place there his wyffe lay he longid fore
in his heart to go the dir and thann he preyde the shipmen to bring him the di^
Than he saw al^ tell child sittyng on the sea sonde playng with small stones
but as soon as the child saw him hit ran forth in to the ro^ke and he
followed aftir till he come there he left his wyffe. And he took ^^ the mantell
and found the child sokkyng one hi^ moderis papp^es. Than thankyd he god and
maudeleyn and seyde mary thou art great with god that haste kept a child ij.
year sokkyng of a deed body in great comfort and joy to me But and thou
woldiste prey to thy lord fore my wyffe that she might rise to lyffe than were
I ever bonndyn to be thyn servant and woll while y live Thanne with that
word she s^ake and seyde blessid mote thou be mary that were mydwyff^ to me
and norse to my child while I have be in my pilgremag^ Than seyde this man
wyffe art thou a live and she seyde ye fire now I come fro my pilgremage as ye
do and told him of every place that he had be at Thanne he ^^elid down and
thankid god and mary mawdeleyn and when they come home they fond mary p^chyng
and techyng the people. and ^ none they knelid down and thankid her and told
her what p^etyr seyde and preyde her to tell what they should do and they would
do hit with good will Than mary badde they should distroye the temples of
maume^try and bilde chirches and make fountes and christian the people and so
with in short time all the land was cristoned Tha^ for mary gaffe her all to
contemplacion she went far in to a wilder nesse and was there xxx. winter
vnknowyn to any man Descendebant ange li et eam in ethera lenabant And angeles
come vij. times a day and bare her up in to the air and there she was fed
with heavenly sode. But when god would y^ sche should pass out of this world
he made an holy p^ste to se how angeles bare her up in the air than went he
nere the place and askid in the name of god who was there if hit were a christian
man he should speak and tell what they were (...)

took a nothir husbonde y^ was callid cl(...)phas and she had by him a nothir
daughter that was callid mary cleophe and than he dyed and she took iij.
husbonde that highte salome and by him she had a nothir daughter that was
callid mary salome and when she had these three doughtres in worship of the
trinite than would she have no more husbo^des but leave in chastity and
holiness* Tha^ was this mary cleophe weddid to a man that was callid ^ pheus
and had iiij. sons. James the less Joseph that was barsabas Simon and judah
The iij. mary was weddide to a man that was callid zebedeus and she had by him
ij. sons James the more and johan euangeliste Than as god seyth him self y^
of a good tree comythe god fruit so of this god woman come an holy ho spryng so
let us serve this holy woman that she may prey for us now and ever Amen.

schewe a yense malice meekness and a y^^ e^uetyse largeness a yense
persecucion and tribulacion love and sweetness. Than sixtus the pope had be in
spain he brought laurence with him to Rome and made him his arche deko^ to
serve holy church and pore people Than had the Emperor envy to him and
purposed to do him to death Than laurence to schewe mekenes ^ yense malice and
enquerid fast aftyr pore people and went to hem and gaffe hem mete and dryn^e
and clothis so he come to a wedowes ^ouse there as was much pore people loggid
the which wedowe had belo^ge sike on the head ache Than Laurence had
co^^assion of her and made her hole and mekely wosche all the pore people fete
and ser^ed hem of mete and drink And for he herd th^^ there was a poor man
there be side in a place that was blind he went the^ir and helid him So ever
the more the Emperor schewed malice to him the more he gaffe him to meekness
and holy devotion ^e schewed also a yen touetyse largeness For^ when (...)
si^iu^ had take Laurence the tres^u^ of holy church to keep and to hem that

suffer more than y and there for make the ready for there is great tourment
ordained for the. Tha^ were there sum herd Laurence speak of tresour than the
Emperor sent aftyr Laurence and seyde. Ostende michi thesa^r^a ecclesie.
Show me the tresour of the church or ^lse thou shall be put to soche a
tourmente that y^ shall be feign to deliver hit Than how (...) sixtus and semt
Laurence come to ^^is tresour ye shall here. we read that there was an holy man
that highte Origenee that conuertid philip the Emperor tha^ the reme of
france was rebel a yense the emperor of rome than this emperor sent a
knight of his in to france with much people to over come france This knight
was callid decius and in short time he made france sogettes to the emperor as
the were to ^or^ Than when this emperor philip herd that decius had do so
well in great worship to Deciu^ to thank him for his journey. The emperor
took with him a few men and rode of rome a yense decius to welcome him home
Than decius saw y^ the emperor did him so great reverence he thought hit had
be for dred^ and not for love and thought to be emperor him self and so in
that night next la^tyr as the emperor lay in his bid sleping deci^^ slew
him and took all his people to rome with him Than wha^ the romay*nes and the
senators herd there of what for dread and what for love they made decins
emperor Tha^ when philippus sone he^de tell that his fadir was deed in this
wise he was a ^erde le^^^ decius wol^^ have ^ayn him and took all his ^^de^is
tresour to holy church and bare hit to (...) sixtus and to Laurence preyng hem
if cause were that decius slew him they should dele this tresour to holy
chi^^he and to pore people that had need Than decius slew philippis sone for
fere left he would have vengid his f^deris death when he had come to ^annes
state. and this was the tresour that ^^pe sixtus and laure^ce had and for this
tresour they put Laurence in to p^son. Than was there a man y^ hight lu^^ll^s
in prison y^ by great weping had lost his sight tha^ Laure^ce made him to see a
yen and cristoned him. where fore many blind men and women come to Laurence
and had her sight. than the emperor sent to Laurence to deliver the tresour
than he preyde him of iij. days respite and so he would show the tresoure So
these iij. days laurence was let out of prison and went and gederid all the
pore people to gedir that he cowde find blind lame or crokyd and the iij. day
he brought hem before the emperor to his paleyse and said Lo here is ever
lasting tresour this wolle never fail fore hit woll endure for ever in heaven.
so Laurence shewde ^ y^u^e couetyse largenes for he delte for goddis sake all
that he had and might have spente hit in vanite and he had would. Also in
tourment of passion he schewde love and sweetness. than the emperor
co^maundid to bring for the all manner of tourmentry scourges nails stones
salt piche brymstone brennyng coals iron schaftes barris of Iron gred irons
and co^maundid all schuld be spente upon Laurence but he would schew the
tresour and for sake his god and to do sacrifice to mawmentis. than seyde semt
Laurence thou un blessid man these metus and drynkes have I ever desired for

than was the emperor wroth and co^mau^did to beat him scourges full of knottes
and leave not till the blood ran down on every side and than they seyde
cheynes of ^^on br^unyng to his sydus that bren^^the the flesche from the bones
and ever laurence thankid god hertely. Tha^ was decius wod for woe and seyde
though thou with thy wyche crafce sc^rnest my tourme^tes yet thou shuldeste
not scorn me And than he co^maundid to beat him a yen wi^h wi^pis and knottes
of led till the bones were bare Thann laurence yafe up his head to god and
preyde. tha^ there come a voice from heaven thou must suffer more tourmentis and
passion for love of me this decius he^de hit him self and thou shalt come to
me with great joy and bliss Than seyde deci^s to the people ye may here all
how fendes com and comfort him go and beat him a yene with s^^rges Than was
there a knight of the Emperors that hight^ romanus that saw an Angel with a
schete of silk com and wype laurence fidis tha^ he for soke the emperour^ and
be come the disciple of semt laurence and laurence anon cristoned him. than
decius made to smite of romanus head. tha^ decius did make a great fire and
set a gredyron there on to roste laurence and thurst him down with fire for
kys and they did so Than laurence lokid up on the emperor and seyde ^howe
wreche y^ side is rostid y now ete there of while y^ other side rostith I dread
not thy tourmentes and cast his eyon up to god and seyde Lord ihe su criste
take my spirit and so he yield up the ghost* than the tourmentures went her
^ey and left the body ^ying there than come criste^ people and took the body and
beried hit with great lame^tacion. thus la^rence sheude mekenes a yens malice
and largeness a yens couetise and a yens passion love and sweetness for the
great love y^ he had to god made him set naught by all his tourmen^s y^ were
do* to his body Seint gregory tellith how there was a p^ste that hight staculus

lombardes but he wa^tid bread to his werkemen and made much sorrow there fore
and he preyde to god and seint laurence besily of help and tha^ he lokid in to

we find y^ there was an emperor that a cursed man of leuing and when he was
deed there come a leg^o^ of fendes to fech him and as they come by a holy
ermytes selle they made a great noise the ermyte had great marvel there of and
opened a wyndow and spoke to on that come be hind and askid in the name of god
what they were and he said fendes that were sen^^ to the emperor that was deed
to look if they might have him for there reward. than the ermyte co^mau^did hem
to come a yen that wey and tell him how they sp^dde and he did so and seyde
wha^ his sins were leyde in the balau^ce and was ny over come than come that
brennyng deko^ laurence and leyd a great pot on the balau^ce and hit drew up all
to gedir thie post was a great chelyse y^ the Emperor made in the worshipp^
of seint laurence by that he was saved. Thus ye may see and learn to make in
sufferaunce a yense enuyous people also what merit and mede is in largeness
to give hem that has need and what joy and merit hit is to suffer
tribulacion and persecucione and dissese patiently learn of the holy marti^
seint laurence and late us take him for a mirror and prey to him that he woll
be mediator to god for us that we may come to ever lasting bliss Amen

De assumptione beat marie nirginis.
GOod frendis soche a day ye shall have the assumpcion of our lady and hit is
callid so for that day her sone took her up in to heaven body and soul and
crow^^ed her queen of heaven for the angel of heaven come to fette her up
Angelis yoyng and singyng come with procession a yense her with roses and
lilies of paradyse in tokening that she is rose and lely and flower of all
wymmen. and they did homage to her for all angelis and seintes in heaven made
joy and melody in worshipp^ and hnoure of her and so holy church makith mind
of her assumpcion. And yet the gospel of that day makithe no mention but of
ij. sustres that was martha and mary mawdeleyne and said thus. Iutrauit ^hesus
in ^uada castellu^ et mulier ^da^ ^c^. Ihesus entered in to a castle and a
woman y^ was callid martha that took him in her house and she had a sustre that
was callid mary that sat at cristus fete and herd him speak Tha^ was martha
besy to serve criste and sche seyde to him sire bid my sustre a rise and help
me. tha^ answered criste. maria m^liore^ parte^ e legit aue no^ anfere tur abea
Mary has chose the better part y^ shall notte be take a wey from her these be
the words of the gospel of that day and here be no words of our lady as be
seming But he that redith what seint ancesme seyth there he may se that the
gospel pertenith all to our lady and to the l^uing of her. for she was the
castle yt ihu^s entered in to for right as a castle has diverse propertees
that longith to a castle that hit should be mighty and strong right so was
our lady be for all other women. For there as women be fre ell and feeble ^ esy
to over come our lady was strong as a castle and a yen stood the can tells of
the fendes engynnes and put hem be side at all times for right as a castle
has first a deep dike right so had our lady a deep meekness in strenght of
the castle in so much she passid all other in virtue of meekness wherefore god
chose her to b^niodir to his sone be fore all other wymen. and there to criste
berith wittenes thus. Quia respexit bu^ilitate^ a^cille su^ for god be held
the makenesse of his hand mayde^ all generation shall bless me This dike if
it be full of water hit is the more strong to the castle this water is
compassion that a man should have for his sins and to other people dissessed
This water had our lady On this dike lithe a draw brygge that shall be draw
up a yen^ en^myes and let down ^ yense friends be this brigge ye shall
understand discrete obedience for right as a man shall notte late down the
brygge to his enmy though he bid him so man shall not let ^he fend come to
his soul though he tempte him But a none as he is bid any thing that is
help and socoure to his soul tha^ shall he let down the brygge of
obedience and the sonner the better thus did our lady wha^ the angel Gabriell
come to her of co^cepcion of her sone she let not down the brygge a none till
she knew were he was a friend or a enmy and said she should co^ceyue and be a
maid and by the v^w of chastity that she made to fore and as she herd y^ she
let down the brigge of obedience and seyde Ecce ancilla dm^ etc^ Lo here
goddis own hand maiden be it do to me aftyr thy word. This castle is treble
walled. The furste wall be took nithe wedloke fore furste she was wyffe to
joseph for else the jews would have stoned her as for a l^chour if she had
conceived with out wedloke and so the furthir wall be tokenith patience and
the ynner virginite that is may denhode but that is litill worth but hit be
strengith with the wall of patience and litill help is fore mandenhode hit is
lityll worth that can no thing suffer of persecucion nor disseses but ever
playng ^^grochyng and to be a claterer a iangeler a curser and a waryer and a
scolde of her tongue t^ese defend not ma^denhode but rathir cast hit down for
may denhode should be of few words and that she spekith should be honest and
worship both to her own person and to all that be in her p^sence. For hit
is an old englische a maiden should be said and not herd this vera^ had our
lady. For senit Bernard seythe read all the gospel over and thou shall not
find that our lady in all her lyf^e spoke but iiij. times by her own but as
schewas causith The first to gabriell the ij. to elisabeth the iij. to her own
sone in the temple and the iiij. at the weddyng of cane galilee. Thus must the
wall of patience defend the wall of maydenhode This wall of maydenhode and
hit be well kept hit is passing all other. As Bede seythe wedloke is high
there as hit is well kept but yet wedowehode is higher. but virginite passith
all and has most worship in heaven passing all other This wall kept our
lady fore schewas clean both be free will and by a vow and she had a degree
passing all other maydenes that ever were nor never shall be for sch^was both
maiden and modir. And in this castle is a yate that be tokenith feythe for
right as hit is in possible fore a man to go thourgh a wall of stele right so
hit is as in possible fore a man to plese god with out feythe

This feythe had our laby passing all other fore as hit semyth in possible for
a woman to conceive with out carnal concupiscencion of man for hit was never
sey be fore but be techyng of an angel she believed and so come criste and
entered be yates of be leave in to the castle yt is in to the body of our lady
This yate had a toure a boue be tokenith charity For that is a boue all things
and that virtue had our lady well may she be callid a castle For right as all
manner people fle in to a castle both old and young for dread of enemies in so
much that the least child that can cry or speak that is a ferde of any thing
a none cries lady lady for socoure and help for she is socoure and help both
to young and to old less and more in sike and in health The holy ghost is
capteyn of this castle. and his knights be holy angel^e that go with our lady
night and day In this castle be ij. sustres martha and mary mawdeleyne Martha
recepit il lum in domu^ ^^ am. Martha received him in to her house and was besy
to serve him and that other satte stille and had great lust to here him speak.
Be these ij. sustres I understand ij. manner of leuyng of the people that one
is actyfe and that other contemplatyf martha be tokenith actyfe that is be
synes in this world But that should be for cristus sake that is to receive pore
people in to his house and to give hem mete and drink clothe herborowe visit
hem that be in prison comfort the sike crooked blind and lame and to bery the
deed. be that other I understand the contem platyf lyffe that is to people of
holy church that should void in all yt they may this worlds besines and give
hem to all spiritu all occupacion and though they do thus yet there be coueytus
people of this world that said that it is all lost that me^ of holy church
h^n for hit semyth to hem they do no good but ever compain on hem and sey
they do no good Seynte Austeyn seythe that all the world is holy church and
these worldly people hatith me^ of holy church But yet god answerith for hem
and is her voket and so woll at all times while they leave in rest and pese
with ynne hem self But now see how our lady full fillythe both these lives.
She was first martha forther as martha was besy to receive criste in to her
house our lady received him in to her body and there in he was ix. monthus and
she feed him and aftyr come pore and nakyd in to this world and sche gaffe him
mete and drink of her pappes and so fed him and wha^ he was nakid she
clothid him and norisched him. and when he was sike be hynde of youth she heli^
him and when he was boundyn hand and foot in his cradell as in prison she come
to him and vnbou^de him^ and took him and ^elid his soris with the milk of her
pappes. and when he was deed she help to bery him in his tomb and thus she
full fillithe the office of martha perfourmyng the vij werkys of mercy. and yet
she was many time too beled in her heart ^ohan she must bear him from country
to country that was full of mawmentes and there as she knew no man. and when
that she saw him takyn and bound strepe nakyd beton with stour ges that all
his body ran with stremes of blood and naylid on the cross and so do to
death that was to her ^ great troble. thus was our lady actyffe for as the
gospel tellithe she gaffe so great delight to her sons words that she bare in
her heart all the lyffe and techyng of criste in so much that she taught the
iiij. eua^gelistes mark ma ^h^w ^uce and Johan much of yt they wreton and
namely seint Luke for he wrote much of the ma^hode of criste. and thus she
fulfillid the office of mary for hit was for the best wha^ her sone was styed
up in to heaven sche le^te all her besynes and gaffe her all to contemplacion
till her sone fette her out of this world. Thus every man yt can understood may
se that this gospel is co^uement to be radde for hit touchithe the lyffe of
our lady Tha^ for this day was the end of her lift in this world. there fore
holy church redithe this gospel in ensample to all criste^ people to
perform the same leuyng in as much as they may and as god woll gene hem
grace to serve our lady y schall give you ensample



we find of a clerk yt loved our lady well for he radde of her b^wte he had
great lust to see her and preyde besely that he might onys se her or that he
dyed. Tha^ at the last come there an angel and seyde to him fore thou seruyst
our lady so well thou schalt have thy pre your but on think y tell the if
thou se her here in this world thou schalte lose thy sight for the great
clernesse of her Than seyde he I wot well safe so that I may se her.

Than seyde the Angel come to soche a place and thou schalte se her thann was
he glad and thought that he would hyde his on eye and lokyd with that other So
wha^ he come to the place he leyde his hand over that one eye and saw her with
that other eye and so come our lady and he saw her and she went her wey a none
and he was blind with that one eye and saw with that other. tha^ the sight
likid him so well that he would feign se her a yene and preyde night and day
that he might se her a yene. Than seyde the a^ gell if thou se her a yene thou
shall lose the sight of that other eye and he seyde y wot well saffe thou ghe
I had a thousand eyon Than come to soche a place and thou shall se her so when
he come he saw her Than seyde our lady to him my good servant when thou saw me
first thou lost thy one eye how wolte thou do now when thou haste lost thy
other eye Thann seyde he dear lady I wot well saffe though I had a thousand
eyon. Tha^ seyde our lady for thou haste so great liking to me thou shall have
thy fight with both eyon a yene as well as thou had diste and better and so he
had Than served he our lady ever aftyr to his lives end and went to ever
lasting joy and bliss to which god bring us all to Amen.

De sancto bartholomeo.
GOod frendis soche a day ye shall have the feste of seint Bartholomew goddis
own apostle and ye shall fast the even and come to church and here your
seruyse in the worship of god and seint bartholome ye shall understand that
bartholome is as much to sey as Fill in ^s uspe^ dentiame That is to sey the
sone hanging upon me or upon wate^^s than ye schall understand that god is he
that hongith upon the watres in ij. weyes. The first is when he hongith upon
the clouds in the ^irmament till he se time to late hem down Anothir wey he
hongith upon w^ teres when a man or a woman is sorry for his sins and weping
sore for his trespace and bitterly Thanne god takith his teris and ha^ gith hem
upon the high hill of heaven where all the seintes in heaven may have hem in
fight in great joy to all seintes and all angels y^ ben in heaven wha^ they
may se man or woman that has do a mysse many trespass to for sake her sin and
turn to no more there to fore of the teris of a man or woman that is sorry for
his sin in this manner quenchithe the fuyre of hell of this te ris spekith
Johan criso stome and seythe. O thou tere that art mekely let in oryson and
preyour with good devotion the might is so great that thou ghost to heaven and
takyste the word of the jews mouth making him to turn the to saluacione ^
be fore were in the wey of dampnacion also thou makist thy^accusars dom the
fendes and so thou^ q^^chist the fy^e of hell that fendes ma(...)die a yense thy
coming (...) god hongith upon (...)tres. Than fore seint bartholome was goddis
sone as all ben that seruith him he was honging up in iij weyes in devotion of
holy orisones preyng and in feythe full monicion and in sufferyyg of passione
he was honging to godwar de in devout* orison fore that he seyde wit his
mouth he did with his heart so that his heart was all wey hongyng up toward
god both in word and in dedeas the p^ste seyth in the mass. Sur^um ^orda
holds up your hertis to god ^hus this holy man seint bartholo me had ever
his heart to god for great devotion. we find wreton of him thus that he knelid
an C times on the day and a C. times on the night fore great (...)cio^ that he
had to god But for he should not be weary of the travel god sent an angel
ever more to sew him and kept him thus hanged he up be holy orisens preyng. He
was also hanged up be the feythfull monicion in this wise fore god gafe him so
great power ouyr all findis that be his holy monicion he suspendyd hem whedir
they were in man or woman And al so in other mawmentes. we find wreton of
semte bartholome how he come in to ynde in the temple in the which temple was
an image and there in was a fend a mawment that was callid astroth and this
image was made of gold than the fend that was there ynne spoke to him and did
him worshipp^ and by soche words as he spoke he made the people be leave that he
was god and yet the more be leave to the people that he helid many sike men and
wym^n both blind crokid and lame and of many diverse sikenesse that he had
cast^ upon hem to fore him self and so semyng to hem that they were ^eli^ by
him but soche sikenes as god sent upon hem he cowde not hele Thanne was the
temple full of sike people that was brought to this mawment to be made hole
but as soon as bartholome come to the temple he suspended the fendes power that
he might hele no man not there was a nothir mawment callid barth askid hem why
her god gaffe hem none answer he sey de bartholome the apostell of god has
bound him so sore that he dare not onys speak nor crake than told him the
fetru^ of barth and seyde he know every word that he speak now for he has an
angel of god with and tellith him all things that ever was said or down be
him And more over though ye seek him ye shall not find him but if he woll him
self. Than went they home a yene and sought bartholome and might not find
him. Than as bartholome walkid a mo^ ge the people ^ mad man that had ^ fend
with in him a none cride to bartholome goddis own apostell thy preyoures bind
me so sore and brenne me also Than seyde bartholomew hold thy pese thou* fend
and goo out of that man and with that word the fend went his wey and left
the man and a none he was hole Thanne hit happid so that the king of that cite
had a daughter that was mad and sore bounden with cheynes for harm that she
deed among the people And when the king herd how this man was helid a^ none
he sent to bartholomew preyng him that he would hele his daughter and so he
did. Thanne bartholomew prech^d so the king that he turned the king to be
christian and than a none he co^m^undid to draw down the mawmentis that were in
the temple Tha^^ the pepull tied ropis a bout the images neckis and wol de have
draw hem down the mawmentes but they might not for the fend was so strong in
hem

Than Bartholome co^maundid the fendis to come out of the images and to pull
hem to poudir and so they did for they had no power to withstond his
commandment and so they all to brake hem for the temples was so full of sike
people bartholomew preyde to god that they might be hole and a none they were
hole euerycho ne Than come there an Angel that god sent fr^ heaven and a none
in the sight of all the people the temple shone so brighte that no tongue co^de
tell and fly all a boute the tempull And in four partis of the tempull he
made a syne of the cr^^with his fingeres on the walls and seyde right as all
the people be hole of her sikenes so shall this temple be closid from all the
filthe of sin and of the fendes craft that has be there in and I woll show
you that same fend y^ ye have worshippid fore your god Tha^ the fend apperid
like a man of ynde all black and made a cursed noise Than the people began to
fle for fere he was so lo thely* Than seyde the angel make soche a sign of
the cross in your forhedis and be not a ferde of him Than a none in fight of
hem all the angel vnbou^ de this fend and bad him go there as was nostering
nothir of man nor of best and to be there till at the day of dome and never
dissese the people more. tha^ the fend went his wey and the angel stied up
in to heaven. Than the king his wyffe his daughter and all his meyne and much
other people turned to the feythe and bartholome cristoned hem all. thus
bartholome hongith be feythfull monicion for he suspended the fendes pouer that
he might do nothing He was also ho^gid up be suffering of passion for wha^ the
bishop of the temple saw that the people were all most turned to christian
feyth and left the fendes mawmetry he we^ te un to the cite there as a king was
callid astrages and brothir to the king Polmyes and playned to him sore and
said there was a man come to hem that was callid bartholome that had turned his
brothir and all the people to the feythe that they set not by her goddis.
But had draw hem down and all to broke hem and hallowed the temple only to
criste. for this cause he prey de him of help Thanne sent the king ^ M. me^
aftyr bartholome. Tha^ when bartholome was come he astud him why he had turned
his brothir and made him be leave one a deed man that was hongid on the cro^^^
tha^ seyde ^^rtholome I have bou^dyn that god that thy brothir believed on and
shewde that send And if thou or he maiste do so to my god than wolle y believe
as thou does^e. Thanne the king comaundid to hang barthol mew on a crose and
longet o torment him th^^ on and aftir took him down and fley him quycke and
thanne to smite of his h^de. Thanne rome cryseyne people and beryd him with
great reverence and worship and thus he was hanggyd up by great co^pascione
suffurynge. were de in gestys romanoru^ that when frydwicke the Emperor hade
dystroyd a great cite and there in was a feyre church of seinte bartholomewe.
And othere ^oo of diverse scy^t^s

And as a good holy man come by the cite and he saw a great company of men
stonding to gedir. Thanne had this man great mervell of hem and as^id what they

and other seintes thate hadd churches in the^e cite thate were dystroy^d and
there they took their counsel what they mygtht do with the Emperor and they
were in full purpose that he should come be fore god and answer for his dedis
and so the Emperor deyde a fowlle death and was dampened. And also hit is
wretynne in the lyffe of seynte godlake thate furste inhabyt crowland in the

come thedir and nere hand lost his wit for fere But tha^ be great grace he
had mind on seint bartholomew and preyde him with all his heart of help and
socoure. Than a none come seint bartholome and co^mau^did the fendes to go fro

holy born and holy ever aftyr So when she was borne and wenyd and was iij year
of age Ioachim and anne and other friend is brought mary in to the cite of
iherusalem to fore the temple as they had made her a vow to fore Than the
temple stood one an hill and was xv. steyres up to the door and so they left

her craft of vewing of clothis in the temple and at no^ the mete and the

to all christian people how this day was furste found. a great clerk ioha^
Bellet tellith There was an holy man that preyde to god often be night time and so
on a night as he was in his devotion he herd a song of an a^gell in heaven that
our lady was borne of her modir and no more of all the year aftyr so in a
night he herd this melody in the air where for this holy man preyde to god
that he might have wetyng what was the cause that he herd that melodye that
certain night and no more of all the year aftyr Tha^ come an angel to him and
said that night our lady was borne of her modir and there for the melody was
made in heaven at that time. tha^ went he to the Pope and told him how the

come with a great multitude of angeles and brought her to heaven with much
joy and the^e crowned her queen of heaven emperes of hell and lady of all the
world so she is in euyr lasting bliss

we find of our lady how there was a jew that was borne in france and come
in to England for diverse matters that he had to do with other people and come
in glo^ater and to Bristow and so would go in ^o wilke show but he was take by
the wey with the fes and ladde in to an old house and boundyn to a post and

horrible peynes of hell that he was nygh out of his mind Thann said our lady
to him these be the peynes that been ordained to all the that woll not be leave

and she set him on an high hill and shewde him a place of great joy and
myrthe in so much that he was rebaschid with that sight Thanne s^yde our lady
Lo these be ordeynede to all y^ beleuyn in the incarnacio^ of criste and that

De festo sacti ma they.
GOod friend is so ^he a day ye shall have seint mathe u^ ^ay the which was
^^^^tus apostle and ye shall f^^ste the even and come to holy church in
worshipp^ of god and seint matthew he is greatly co^mendid in holy church for
certeyn^ holy virtues that he had Hewas obedient to criste at the first
calling he prechid the gospel with out faynyng and he suffered passion mekely
with out any deuyyng Furste he was obedient to criste at the first calling
for he satte in a certain place besy to get good and cris^ come that wey and
lokyd on him and bad him come and go with him Thann he cast so great love to
cris^ that he left all his goodi^ that he had and sewed criste forth full
simple and full pore. Also he fed criste gladly for on a day he preyde Criste
to ete with him and made criste a great feste not in delicat^ metis and drynkys
But i^* fedyng criste and all his co^pauy for he fed all that would come for
cristns sake for much people sewed crist where that ever he went Secuti sunt
eum turhe multe For diverse causes many followed him sommto be helid of her
sore^ and of diverse sikenes And sum to se miracles y^ criste did sum to
the and to drink with him. and sum that were his enemies that were learned in
the law if they might have takyn him with any word where by they my g^te
have accusid him. and sum to be reformed in virtues and to here his doctrine
and teching as the apostles and many other ^nde nersua Moribus signa cibua
blasphemia doctrina fuere Causa ^um dominum turba secuta fuit And when matthew
had fed ^^ist thus and all that come him criste made him on of his disciples
and gaffe him knowing to preche the be leave and gods word so boldly ever
aftyr y^ he spared nothir fore love nothir for dread. So this matthew apostell
como on a time in to a cite and prechid that was callid Nadabar and there he
found much people taught be the fendes craft in nigransy and taught so
many things and so marvelous that hit was great woundre to here to many man's
wit and all for the people should be leave in hem and do hem worship Thanne
mathewe a none delivered her nigramansy so that all the people knew openly that
hit was the fendes craft where for this people that be leued on this
nigramansy made dragones by the fendes craft to spitte fire and breune so that
the stenche of hem slew much people and they brought this dragones to have
devoured seinte matthew and when mathewe herd there of he made a cross be
fore him and went a yense hem and a none the dragones fill down deed be fore
him. Than seyde matthew to the people if ye have any might reyse hem a yene to
live but they had no power. Than seyde matthew if I were not god dis servant I
would make hem to do you that as ye purposed to do to me. But hit is the
techyng of my maystre ihesu criste to do good a yense evil where fore I bid
you dragons a rise and go to soche a place as ye shall never grieve man nor
best and a none they rose and went her wey. thus matthew turned much people
that come to se that sight. and thanne^ he prechid the people and told hem of
the joy of paradyse There he seyde is day and never night the ^^ is ever
youth and never age there is ever health and never sikenesse there is roses
lylyes and flowree with o^^tewel owyng there b^ popyngaeys and nyghtyngales and
diverse briddes ever singyng love rest and pese with ever lasting charity So
they that leuyth in criste and do aftyr his commandment shall come the their
and be there without endyng. Thus he prechid in a cite where cursed people
were they took him and put out his eyon and cast him in to prison till they
took a visement what death he should dye. But there come an angel thanne to
seint Andrew as he prechid in a far country and brought him over the se
there as seint matthew was and when Andrew saw matthew so foul done a non Andrew
wept and preyde to god for him And a none god restorid matthew his sight a yene
and Andrew went a yen in to his own country to ^reche there as he c^ome fro
and when matthew was out of prison he went and prechid in the cite of Nadabar
in the which the kings sone dyed Than sent the king aftir matthew ^preyde him
to restore his sone to life a yene and so he did where for the king and his
wyffe and his daughter that was callid eufagema took cristendome and the most
part of the people and for god had chosyn this eu fagema to be an holy woman
matthew blessid her and gaffe her the veil of chastity and charit^ and so was
aftyr an holy womo^ and was keeper of many other virgins than dyed her fadir
Thanne come there a king that was callid hertagus that loved this maiden
Eufageme and preyde matheco to help him that he might have her Tha^ seyde
matthew that might not be fore she was weddid to the king of heuene and m^yght
flot break that spouse hode the was her tacus wroth and bad sle matthew and so
as he stood and seyde mass at the Auter there come on be hynde him and slew
him and christian people beried the body in the same church. Than bad the king
set fuyre on eufagema house and that on every side to have brende her there
in. Than matthew apperid to her and bad her be a good there and a none turned
the fuyre from her house in to the kyngis palyse and left there no thing save
the king and a young child with him and the king was smetyn with meselry so
foul that fore great pain and woe he slew him self and so the vengeance fill
on him self that he would have do to other Now ye may well se by this great
miracles that he was an holy man and therefore late us serve him and he wolle
prey for us all Amen.

De festo sa^cti michaelia
GOod frendis such a day ye shall have seint michae^^ day the archa^gell that
day all holy church makithe mind and mention of all angelis for the great
socoure comfort and help that mankind had of angelis and specialy of seint
michaell And for iij. p^rogatiuis that he had for he is wou^drefull in apperyng
marvelous in miracles worchyng and victorious in fightyng he is woundrefull in
appering for as seint Gregory seith when almighty god woll wor^he any
woundrefull deed than he sent for michaell his servant as for his banerer
fore he berith a shield a sign of his arms. where fore he was sent with
moses and Aaron to egipte to wo^che meruelis for though the sign were in
moses the worchyng was done by michaell. For he de* partid the read see and
kept the water in ij. parties while the people of israel went thourghe and
so passid and ladde hem forth to flom jordan and kept the water like an hill
of each side hem while they passid save and sound to the land of be he^t^
Also michael is keeper of paradyse and takith in souls that bithe sent the dir
Also he shall sle antecrist in the mount of olyuete and he shall bid all the
deed a rise and come to the dome and other angelis with him shall bring all
the instruments of his passion the cross the crown spear nails hamer sponge
eysell g^all scorges and all other thyngis yt was at cristus passion to show
hem that shall be dampened that set naught ne believe not in his passion thus
it apperith wou^drely. Also he worchid miracles meruelously for appolia is an
high hill that is callid gargus and is nyghe a great cite and there dwellid a
rich man of diverse catell and as his bestis went one the hill^ there happid
a balle left be hynde other bestis tha^ went this man and his servant to
seek this bolle and found him stondyng be fore an hole in a great dene and
than on of hem shette an arrow at him and the arrew turned a yene and smote
him that shote the arrow and hurt him sore Thanne were they sore a ferde and
thought what that might mean and went to the bishop and told him all the
cause tha^ the bishop preyde to god to have knowleche what hit was Tha^ in the
mount of gargan michaell apperid to him and seyde hit was goddis will that the
man should be hurt for ye shall know well yt y am kepir of ye place where for
go thou and make a church of yt dene and so the bish^p made a fair church
there. Also michaell a^pered to a nothir bishop and bad him go to an hill top
to the mount of gardell and there as he found a bolle teyde he should make a
church in the worshipp^ of god and semte michaell Thanne were there ij.
ro^chis of stone on eythir side that the work might not up Than semt michaell
appeared to a man that hight baymo and bad him go and put a wey the roche and
dread no thing so this man went thethir and set to his shuldres and bad the
roche go utter in the name of god and seint michaell and so the hills went
utter as much as nedich to the work



we read also in the life of seint gregory how there was a great multitude of
people in rome and they saw arrows of fire come out of the air and slew
much people. Thanne seint Gregory preyde to god to sese that pestilence Than
he saw an a^gell stondyng one a castle wall wypyng his blody sword but that
angel he seyde was seint michaell was sent thethir to punische the people for
syn thus michaell was meruelons in miracles worchyng. Also he was victorious in
fightyng for when the citezenis of septutyne were oppressid with paynemes and
should give he^ battle they preyde often to seint michaell of help Tha^ the
night be for as the battle should be michaell apperid to the bishop and
seyde to him have no dread but go to the battle boldly and he would help him
and so on the morrow when the battle should be the hill of garganus was over
c^uered with a great myste and arrows come out of the myste fleyng of fire
and b^ltis of thoundir and hurt much people of the paynemes in so much that
they slew all that ever might fle And so many were sleyne and tho that were a
life were saved be great miracle of god and were cristoned. Seint johan
euengeliste seythe in his Apocalips how michaell and his angels foughten with
lucifer in heaven that is callid the dragon and his angels and with help of
god* michaell had the better and drove out the dragon and all his fellowship
in to the air between heaven and earth and so they be there yet as thick as
motis in the fonne And for criste come to heaven in a blaste of thoundyr. and
there for yet when they here thoundir they fall down to the er the for fere
and tha^ they go not up a yene till they have do sum harm. for than they
make batis and stryues and man slawter and make great wyndes both in land and
in water and do much harm and yet they would do much more than they do
nere seynt^ michaell for all her sorrows is to se souls engeles in heaven in
the place there they were ynne to fore Also other spirits there were that
s^ode not stead fast toward god but flatering the which seint michaell
drove out heaven all in to an isle of the sea as ye shall here As seinte Brandan
seyled in the se he come to an isle and saw a tree was so great be the high
and broad that it was wou^dir to tell on the which tree satte briddis thicker
than the bows and were as white as snow. tha^ he preyde to god to wete what
they we Tha^ come on of hem and satte on the shippis board and batered with
his wings and made a sown like an organ Than said brandan if thou be come a
messenger speak and tell me what ye ben Thanne he said we were angels that
stood not stead fast in the be leave a^ michaell wa^ and there for we were
dreuyn out when michaell drove out lucifer and his angels But yet we have
every day a remedy to woshippe god Thus was michaell woundrefull in apperyng
marvelous in miracles doing and victorious in fightyng where late us worshipp^
this holy angel that he may be our shield in fightyng a yense our gostely
enemy the fend so that we may have the victory of him now and ever Amen

De festo sa^cti luce.
GOod frendis soche a day ye shall have seint lukys day the evangelist ye shall
understood that criste had iiij. evangelists that is mark matthew luce and
johan these wrote the gospel the gospel is no more to sey but goddis word
these holy euangelistis wrote not only that god spoke but also what y^ he did
and what he suffered for mankind for hit should be know to all mankind fore
ever more to think on goddis word and to do there aftyr These iiij. be likened
to iiij. diverse bestes and so they be portrayed in iiij. parties of the cross
on every side of criste. for mark a lion for matthew a man for luce a calfe and
for johan an egyll But late no man suppose that they were soch bestis but
likened to soch bestis for diverse causes* for be cause that matthew wrote most
of cristus manhood there fore he is likened to a man And luke wrote most of
cristus sacrafice and his death there for he is likened to a calfe or to an ox
fore a calfe that was offered in sacrifice of the old law in tokening that
criste should be offered for sin of the people in sacrifice in the auter of
the cross And mark wrote most of the resurrection vprysing and there for he is
likened to a lion For as bokis sey and tell when a ly on has young welpes
they shall lie as deed three days aftyr they be welpid Than comyth the lion and
sethe his welpes deed a none he makith so the a roryng and a cry y^ the deed
welpes wake there with and quekon and take life So when criste had leyne iij.
days in his tomb Than the fadir spoke to him and bad him rise and so rerid
from death to live Also johan is likened to an egyll for be kind she fleith
highest in to the air and next to the son so johan wrote most of the
godhede and but litill of the manhood these be the causes that they be likened
to iiij. diverse bestio But now ye shall understand that Luke was likened to
a calfe. iij manner of weyes that is in the thought word and deed he offered
his thou ghte to god for there as he was furste besy to get goodis of the
world with his craft for as bo^is tell he was a leche and for couetyse of
good he slew many a man bodily than had he offendid god so grievously that a
none he offered his thought in sacrifice for as bo kys teache god is highely
plesid with thought that is when a man is sorry for his sins in his heart and
thynkith verily to for sake sin and a mende him Also he offered his word to
god in sacrifice for as he was wont to fore to spe^de his speech in many ydyll
words or he come to the apostle aftyr he turned his spech in to profit to
all criste^ people where for he went to our lady and she taught him the
gospel tho that he wrote and fore he was a clean maiden our lady cherischid
him the more And so taught him full goodly how the a^gell come to her in
message and what he seyde and what answer she gafe a yene. and so all things
that she did with her sone and of all her doing till our lord was styed up in
to heaven. and whann luke had learned this persitely than he lokyd what Mark had
wreton and matthew and so to ke athem and there as they wretyn darckly he wrote
openly all things. thus in prechyng and techyng he offered his word to god
Also he offered his deed to god in sacrifice. fore he peyned his body with
diverse penance of fasting and of hard leuing in keeping preyng Also he wrote
all the persecucion that the apostelis suffered of the jews in iherusalem wha^
they had great pursewte and tourme^t for goddis sake and he wrote all the
persecucione of seint steuyn how he was stoned to death Thann went seint luke
to saint poule and sewed him in many mystheuys and dissese ^ he had and in full
great dre de and never departid from him till poule was deed. Thanne went luke
to a country that was callid betanie and there he p^chid the word of god and
was there till he was xl. winter of age. than he dyed full fair full of the
holy ghost for he leuyd in holy virtuous. and aftyr his death god showed for
him many fair miracles and so endid in criste and went in to ever lasting
bliss to the which god bring us all to Amen.

De simone and inda
GOod frendis so che a day ye shall have the feste of Simon and jude and ye
shall fast the euyne and one the morrow come to church and worship god and
these holy apostles. we shall on derstonde that eythir of these has to names
that one was callid Simon elotes and that other judas iacola and judas tha deus
showing be these how the name that a man has in this world dies and passithe
out of mind when he is deed where fore every criste^ man shul de be besy to
take him a name that should be wreton in the book of lyffe y^ should last
ever. And there for these ij. apostles suffered great penance travel
tribulacion and dissese and at the last pain of death fore cristus sake with
hertes meke and clean conscience Simon is as much to sey as obedience that
makith a man meke in heart Judas is as much to sey as confessi on that
clensith a man's conscience of all manner of fynne And thus be fore or they
dyed they gaffe every man ensample how they took her death meke ly for cristus
sake and dye with clean conscience and than they shall be wreton in the book of
lyffe with great worshipp^ in the fra ternite of heaven but they that grochyn in
her hertes of dissese and persecucion and ever playnyng they have need to prey
to god to be helid of that sykenes that they have in her spiritis



We read in the lyffe of the apostell how a king that was callid Abagarus and
was leper and herd how that our lord ihesu criste did many miracles and helid
all that were sike Than he wrote a letter in this wise king A bagarus gretith
ihesus ^a uioure well that prechid in the country of iherusalem and I have
herd of thy miracles that thou doste and so thou heliste all manner of
sikenesse with out any herbis or salues and cureste blind and ^rokid and lame
and that is more merueyle thou reyse deed bodies to live where for I think in
my heart and in my believe that thou art very godd is sone and come down from
heuyn to earth and leuyste here among the people as one of hem where for I
write to the that thou wolte come to me and hele me of my leper that greuith me
full fore. and so I understand that the jews have orderned to do the to death
and y have a litill cite that is good and honest and plenteuous and hit is
sufficiant I now for us both to leave by and there shall we both be in rest
and pese. Than criste wrote a yene and seyde y^ art blessed that be leave ste
on me and haste not seyne me and for thou would that I should come to the I
sey to the I must do that I come fore and than y wolle send sum of my
disciples to the that shall hele the of thy leper Tha^ for this king that
criste might not come to him for great desire that he had to se him he sent to
him a payntour that was a maistre of that craft to peynte cristus visag as he
cowde But when this peyntour come to criste and lokyd on his visage hit shone
so brighte that he might not look there one. Than he made great sorrow and
morning that he was come so far and might not speed of his purpose Than
criste took a clothe of the peyntour and wypid his face there with and than was
the forine of his visage there on and than the peyntour bare hit to the king
Than was the king wou^dre glad and did hit great reverence with all his heart
Than aftir cristus ascension thomas of ynde be the sent of the apostles was
sent to this king Ab^garus and wha^ he saw thomas he saw soche a shynyng in
his face that he went hit had be criste Than said thomas to the kyn^ (...) in

De festo omnium sanctorum.
GOod frendis soche a day ye shall h^aue all halowyn day and ye shall fast the
even and on the morrow come to ch^irch and worship god and our lady and all
halowyn. Friends ye shall understand that this feste was ordained fore iij
special causes and that be these Furste fore the temple h^alowyng for omission
fullfillyng and also fore negligent leuyng Furste for the temple halowyng for
when the romans were lords of all the world they made a temple in rome as a
doffe house and named hit panteon and set in the myddis of the temple an image
that was the chief mawment of rome and of every land in the world an other
image all a boute the walls and the name of the lord that the jmage was of
wreton under the fete of the jmage and all was made so by nigromancie if that
any lord turned from the emperor a no^ the jmage of the land would tourn
his back to the jmage of rome and his face to the wall So wha^ the bishopp^
come to the temple and found any image turned a none they would to the
Emperor and tell him. Than would they ordeyn an oste of people and send in to
the land and set hem at rest and pese And so this temple endured thus un
to the time that (...) Bonif^ce the iiij. come Thanne he went to the emperor
that was callid foca and preyde him that he would give him that temple that he
might put out the multitude of mawme^tis and to halow hit in the worship
of god and our lady and all balowyn And so he gaffe the (...) the temple Than
come there an other (...) that was callid Gregory and co^maundid all holy
ch^urche to halowe the feste like as it was be gone Also this feste was ordained
by the same (...) to fullfille our omissionis For many seyntes days in the
year we leuyn un served fo^^ there be so many that we may not serve each by he^
self For as jerome seyth that there be for each day in the year x. M. marteres
out take the first day of Ianiuere. where fore holy church ordained that this
day we should fullfille thatswe have left be hind all the year And thus ^ery
seintis euyne has his worship of us if we keep well yt day in worshipp^ to
god and our lady and all halowyn Also this feste is ordained ^o be hallowed to
cleanse us of our negligence and vnco^nyng and also by worldely occupacions
doing we be full recheles in keeping our holidays. and there for the holy
feste is ordained fore we should make a mendis as moch^ as we may of that we
have trespasid in other festis and there for understand ye that they be in
great parell that brekithe this feste or any other in worldely occupaciones
worchyng or in any synn doing in byyng or in sellyng or in any other fall hode
contryuyng. Also ye shall understand that this day our preyoures shall be
sonner herd tha^ any other day. fore this day all the seintes in heaven come to
gedir to prey to god fore us. and there fore ye may know well that all coming
to gedir shall be sonner herd than one or to be hem self. The seintes that be
in heuene were sum time as we be now both in flesche and in blood body and
bone and were our elder faderis and they be full glad and make much joy
whann they may get any preyoures or al^es dedis of us with the which they may
p^sente god and our lady preyng fore us. and to show you be ensample h^ow all
seintes come to gedir as this day ye shall here



we find wreton in legenda aurta that in the same year this fe^te was ordained
to be hallowed there was a keeper of seinte peter's ch^irche in rome that this day
aftir matenes at midnyght wha^ all people were go from matenes fore great
devotion that he had he went to every auter in the chirch and seyde h^is
deuocions and when he had gone all a boute than went he to the hye anter and
there fill a sleep and his spirit was raueschid and saw the fadir of heaven
sittyng in his mageste and a great multitude of angeles a boute him And than
come a fair queen with a crown one her head richely a rayde and a great
company of virgins and maidens sewyng her Thann the king a rose a yene her and
to set a cheyre of gold and set her there yun. tha^ come one clothid in
camel skyunes and h^im sewed a great company of aged men Than come a nothir
like a bishop and aftir him many other bishops And than come a great
multitude as it had be knights and aftir hem much other people and all they
come be for the king and knelid down before the king and did him worship Than
the bishopp began to sey matenes Than spoke this in to the angel that lad him
and askid him what all this people was in that a ray than seyde the angel the
king is god him self. and the queen is our lady and he that was clothid in
camel skynnes was ioha^ baptiste and other patriarchs and prophets with him
The bishop was seint petir and other apostles and confessoures with him. The
knygh^tis was seint gorge with other marterers comyners that were good true
leuers and servants to god here upon earth and they come all to thank god
for the great worship that they had here in earth and preyde be sely to god
that bithe^ in earth that he should have mercy on hem This is the cause that
this feste was furste found and there fore late us come to church and
worship god and all halowyn y^ they may prey for us that we may at once last
end ^^ of ^ nombre that shall worship god that book spe^^th of and seyth thus
Diditurbam magnam quam nemo dinume rare poterit for they be so many that no mau
can nombre hem and all they prey for us euyr more that we may come to that
bliss that they be in Amen.

In die auimaru^.
GOod frendis soche a day ye shall have all soule^ day the day of the souls in
purgatory there a byding the mercy of god and have much need of help and right
as holy chirch worshippid all semtes to be holpyn be the preyoures of hem right
so holy church ordeymth this day to singe and to read and to do alms deeds
having full be leave to relese hem that been in purgatory of her peynes where for
god will that all christian people to her power this d^y releue hem for the ^^^^^
preyour or alms deed that is done gretely releuythe hem. ye shall understand
that there be iiij. thynhis that gretely he lpithe souls that been in purgatory
and be these. Fideliu^ amicoru^ oracio elco^ sinaru^ largicio salutari^ boltia
nimia racio. ieiuniorum obseruacio that is preyoures of fre^des de uoutly seyde
and alms deed doing and masses singing and abstmaunce in fasting preyoures
helpith much a soul For like as a lord has a man in prison or in any
distress and at the preyoure of him that he louith he relesith in party or
all And that is showed be ensample



we find in legenda aurea that there was a man that had his house by a church
yerde side and his door openid to the church and be vsid be custume as often as
he come or went to sey every time De^rofundis fore all christian souls. Tha^
hit happid so on a time that he was pursewed with enemies as he went
homewardes But when he come in to the church yerde he knelid down and thought
to sey Deprofundis and these enemies come aftyr. A noue the deed bodies resyn
every chone with soche instruments as they wroughten with in her lyfes and a
none they dreue a wey his enemies but when they saw that they cryde god mercy
and this man. And ever aftir preyde and deed alms deed for hem that were in
pain Thus I may well prove that devout preyoures helpithe many a soul that been in purgatory. Also alms deed helpithe many souls Sicnt a^na extingnit
ig^e^ ita elemosina extingn^t paccatu^ Right as watyr quenchith fire so alms
deed que^chith the fuyre that brenuyth hem that bethe in purgatory if they be
in good lyffe and persite charity y^ down hit And if alms deed be done for
hem that be in joy and have no need there to hit is put in to the tresoure of
holy church and as goddis will is hit is delte and releuith hem that has
most uede there to and so god assynith hit to hem that have most need and
than the souls that bethe holpyn there with thank the soul that hit is done
for Thus ye may know well that alms deed helpith gretely souls that hit is
done fore and be in purgatory fore often holy men have herd fendes cry and
make great sorrow for with alms dedis souls were take from he^



we read in old time good people would on all halowyn day b^^^ beede and dele
hit for all criste^ souls and yet there be sum that vsyn hit but all to few
(...) find in lege^d^ (...) and of a ^uyghte y^ shul ^^ go to a batayles had a
cosyn that he loved pas ^^^g^ well and s^yde to him thus if he were slain in
the battle he should selle his horses dele the ^^^oure to ^ore people in alms
to prey for all christian souls so hit ^^^pid that he was deed and his cosyn
loved well the, horse and took him to his own use The^ sone oftir this knight
^^ per^d to his cosyn and said thus to him viij days for my horse thou haste
made me to brenne in purgatory and there for god woll take (...) on the For
sothe ^d ^e to day thy soul shall be in hell with the fend. Et ego purgattus
^ado in regnum dei And I am p^rged and shall go to the kingdom of hepe^ And a
none an horrible no^se wa^ in the e^^^ of sendes and caughte this man and hare
him a wey The iij that helpith is mass so^^ when any soul apperith to any man
to have any help he desirith masses and preyith to have massi^ song for him
For right as mete and dryn^^e comfortid a man when he is febull so the
sacrament in the anter comfortith the soul that the masses be done fore. Hit
ie wreton in legend a aurea how a bishop suspendid a priest, for he could sey
none other mass but of requie^ but he song every day de uoutly aftyr his
co^nyng Thann one a day as the bishop went toward ^^^^nes hit semythe to
him that deed bodies ^^syn and come a boute him and ^eyde thou haste no mass
for us and more over thou haste take our p^ste aw^y from us Look that this be
a mendid or else with in short time god wolle take oe^ g^^^nce one the fore
our s^^e Thanne was the Bishop gretely a ferde and a none he bad the priest
singe of requiem as he did to fore and so he did as often as he might

Also we find that fiseheris set her news in he rueste to fische and they
took up a great pese of Ise and that hit was the coldiste ^se that ever they
feld and hit would not melte for the son* Than brought they yt yse to the
bishop for he had a great brennyng hete in his fete and hit was the coldiste
that ever he felt* Than spoke there avoyre to him out of the yse y am a soul
y^ suffer my penance here in this yse for y have no fre^des that wolle do
masses for me y shall be delivered of my penance and thou shall be hole of
thysikenes and he seyde he would he would singe for him and bad tell him his
name ^ ever while he was at mass he leyde the yse under his fete and ever as
he seyde mass the yse malte a wey and so in a while the yse was molton and the
soul ^ate of purgatory and the bishopp^ was hole of his sikenesse Thanne the
soul apperid him with much joy and seyde with thy masses singing y am holpyn
out of pain in to ever lastyng bliss. and he told the bishopp^ that he
should dye sone aftyr. and to come to ever lasting joy with outyn end to thew
hiche god bring us all to Amen

knew the holiness of marten and seyde marten help and a no^ they were holpyn.
Also he rode on a time in his visitacion a hounde at an hare under his horse
fete than had he pite on this besc* and bad the hounds stand still and late
the best go and a none the hounds stood as stille as they had be put in to
the earth. An other he saw an addir swimming in a water and he seyde to the
addir In usmine do mini iubeo te reddi re In the name of god I command the to
go a yene there thou come fro and a none she turned a yen Thann marten sighed
woundre sore and seyde I am sorry that serpents herith me and men woll not here
me An other time he come by the yate of a cite that highte padyse and there he
kyssed an horrible mesell a none he was hole with the same kiss Also he was so
paciente that many times his own clerkissmote him and yet he suff^red it
patiently and was not wroth So on a time as he rode by the wey in his
visitacion him self for that was his manner he had a row mautell of black and
come a carte by the wey with carriage and the bestes in the carte saw the black
ma^cell wau^ring with the wind and flewe a wey and all to barsce her gere
Thann the carters with her whippes all to beat marten and gafe him many sore
strokes and all he suffered mekely and said nothing Than would they have gone
her wey but they might not stere from the place till they knew that hit was
merten and thanne they cryde him mercy-and than a non he for gafe he and the
bestis passid fair forth and all the harneyse was save y now. Also on a time
as marten satte in his selle the fend come to him like a king with shynyng
crown and seyde y am common from heuyne to speak with the believe on me cristua
ego sum for y am criste and martyne lokis on him and seyde my lord ihesu criste

yet an other time he come to mertyu and repreuede him that he took p^ple to
him that had sinned and were shreuyn and turned a yen to her syn that they had
done to fore and seyde though thou take he^ to thy grace god woll not Tha^
said mertyn wreche and thou wolte leave thy pursuit of criste^ people and ask
mercy with a meke heart I ^^nste to god he is so merciful y^ he wolle gefe
mercy. and when mertyn should pass out of this world and lay in his death bed
the fend come and satte by him disputyng with him if he might have caught him
in any word of mysse believe in his end. marten seyde to him. Goo hense thou
cruel best for thou shalt no thing find ^ mysse with me but god shall
resceyue me and thann he made to ley him in asks and here and he seyde the
vij. psalms and latinie and gaffe up the ghost and was heried in his own
church with much honor and worship in turon Than liiij* winter aftir there
come a bishop and translatid him. and when he had made all thing ready he leyde
hand one marte^s body to have borne hit forth but he might not Than thought
the bishop it is not martens will to be remenyd and left of Than come a fair
old man and bad him go to a yene and he would help him and thann they bare
the body in to the tomb with out lettyng and so whann the service was done
this old man vanisched a wey and there by they know well that hit was seint
marte^ And than god shewde many fair miracles fore him



Hit happid on a time that there was ij. beggeris that one was halte and might
not go and that other was ^^nde and might not se And so to make the people to
have the more compassione of hem the blind bare the lame and the lame taught
the blind where he should go and thus they gate much good and had esy live But
they were ever a ferde to mete with the shrine of seint marten left he would
have helid hem of her sikenesse And so on a time at a stretis end at a
tourning suddenly at a corner they met with the shrine of seint marte^ and a
none they were both hole And the blind might se and the lame might go And
than they cride to seint marten and seid marten we thank the fore the good
that we have fore thy sake here to fore. we thank the not for our hele. For
now we must goo labure and travel and so get our leuyng for the people well
give us no more alms and here to fore we leuyd full esyly with litill
travel and ferde well Alas alas that we come here this day fore now our
myrthe and well rare is gone Thus this holy man did many miracles where for I
may see that he may do with god there for let us prey to him that he may prey
to god for us Amen.

^e sancta katherina uirgine
GOod frendis soche a day ye shall have seint katherines day the holy martyr
she was a kings daughter and come of g^^t ^^e the But she set all her, mind
to god and set, naught be the pride and richesse of the world for hit is but
a vanite but she set her heart all only on ihesu So when she h^d be at stole
and learned a while a none she would dispute with any clerk y^ would come for
she was enspired with the holy ghost But when she herd on a time that
marencius was come to the cite of Alisaundre with so much people and so rially
that the cite dommed of hem For he come to make a solemn sacrifice to his
goddis that were of gold and silver in sikenesse of bollis and calves and
other bestis. Than seint katheryne saw that and blessid^ her and went in to
the temple and rebukyd the Emperor bodily and seyde that he did foul a mysse
fore to do that worship to fendes and leave the worship of god in heaven that
made all thing of naught and sent man lyffe wit and hele and preued by great
reason how criste was both god and man and how he bought all ma^kinde with his
passion one the cross with his death. and taught how every man should honor
god and lene false mawmentes. Tha^ was the emperor wroth and ^ad take her
toward till he might be at leysoure. So in the mean time he sent aftyr the
grettiste maistres and the wyseste clerkys that were in any country far a
bonte him And when they were come he bad hem go dispute with katherine and over
come her and they should have right well for her labor. Than were they wroth
to c^ome so far to dispute with a woe man and seyde the least scoler in the
scole had be y now to over come her. But when katherine had disputid with hem
with help of the holy ghost she conuertid hem every chone to the feyth of
our lord ihesu criste in so much that they were ready to suffer death fore
cristus sake* Than a none maxencius co^maundid to make a great fuyre and ^renne
hem in the fuyre. But by the help of the holy ghost the fuyre bre^ de uo
parties of he bodye^s ne the least cloth of hem and yet lay fair deed as they
had be a sleep

Than the Emperor made do ka herine nakid and beat her with scorgi^ ^ she was
all blood and full of wounds and than he put her in to prison vij. days
with out mete and drink Thanne had the queen a great lust to speak with
katherine and took a knyghre with her that highte porphirius and went to
katherine and than they saw an a^gell set a crown of shynyng gold on the
queen's he de and an other on porphirius he de and bad hem be stedefast for with
in three days they should come to heaven be suffering of martyrdom Thanne sent
the Emperor aftir katherine and went to have found her nyghe deed but all
that time god sent her mete from heaven and whann the emperor saw her a lyffe
he was wode for word and made her to be set between ij* whelis and turned
on vpwardes and anothir downewardes full of ^oll^s and sword points for all
to raze katherine. Than come an a^gell as ^it had be a wind and all to brake
hem and slew iiij M. of the tyrants Tha^ saw the queen that miracle and come
be fore the king her housbond and re^ukyd him yt he saw the might of god so
openly and would not be leave there o^n Than bad the king led forth the queen
and cut of her pappes from the body with hokys and tha^ to smite of her head
tha^ for porphirius beried her lxxx. of her knyghtis were martered with her
they smote of porphirius head Than spoke the emperor to katherine and seyde
that he would wedde her and she would fro criste and believe in his goddis and
she seyde she set naught by him nor by his goddis and when he saw that he
made to smite of her head Than a none in scede of blood come much fair milk.
And than come an angel and bare the soul in to heaven And angelis come and
bare the body in to the air and so in to the mount of synay and there beried
it with worshipp^ and there god wronghte many fair miracles into this day At
the foot of the mount there is an abbey of monks that leuyn in great
abstinaunce and this abbey is strong and high wallid and barred about with
yrou for wild bestis and in that abbey lies seint katherine in a fair tomb
of alabaster for her bones were shedi^ for the more worship and a bouyn in
the church is the bnshe there god stood in when he spoke to moses and wrote
the law in to ij. tables of stone and that busche is also grene and fair as
hit was the same day Also in that abbey is a great merueyle and is this every
monk has a lamp^e with oil brennyng and wha^ he shall dye they shall know be
hisla^ he for as he drawithe to ^^e death so drawith his ^^mpe And when this
^^bot dies his brethere^ shall singe a mass of the holy ghost and bery him so
lemply and when mass is done they shall find a bille writo^ on the auter how
shall be abbote and so they these her abbot Also on seint katherins night all
the briddi^ in the country come the dir and each of he^ bryngith a branche of
olive in her bill into the place and as pilgremes sey the monkis make oil of
the branches to her lamps for all the year and sum to selle



we find and read of a man that served seint katherine and fastid her even
bread and watir and on a time he come in felleship of recheles people and by
comfort of hem he left his fast and ete with hem and so in the night aftyr
he saw a great company of maydene^ coming by him and among hem there was on
passing all other and each of hem had a crown but on had passing a fair
crown and that was sein katherine. So when she come by this man she hid her
face from him and would not look on him. tha^ he askid on of hem what they were
and she seyde we be virginis and the principal that thou s^iste is seint
kather^^ y^ hid her fate for the be cause thou haste left thy devotion from
her even of fasting Than this man repentid him sore that he had done this deed
so and turned a yen to his devotion and fastid and aftyr was an holy man. and
there for sete us worship this holy virgin that she may prey for us Amen.
