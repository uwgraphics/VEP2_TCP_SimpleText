Here begins a new tracte or treatise most profitable for all husband men
/ and very fruitful for all other persons to read newly correct and amended
by the auctour / with diverse other things added thereunto.

The auctours prologue.
SIt ista question. This is y^ questyon. whereunto is every man ordained. And as
Job says. Ho mo nascitur ad laborem: sicut auis ad volandum. That is to say /
a man is ordained and borne to labor? as a bird is ordained to fly. And the
apostle says. Qui non laborat: non manducet: de bet enim in obsequio dei
laborate / qui de bonis eius vult manducare. That is to say. He that labors
not / should not eat / and he ought to labor and do gods warke yt will ete
of his goods or gifts / the which is an hard text after ye lytterall sense.
For by y^ lettre the king / the queen / nor al other lords spiritual and
temporal should not eat / without they should labor the which were uncomely
/ and not co^uenyent for such estates to labor. But who that redeth in the
book of the moralytees of the chesse / shall thereby perceive y^ every man from
the highest degree to the lowest / is set and ordained to have labor and
occupacyon / and that book is divided in. vi. degrees / that is to say / the
king / the queen / the bishops / the knights / the judges / and the yemen.
In the which book is showed their degrees / their auctoritees / their warkes /
and their occupacions and what they ought to do. And they so doing and
executynge their auctorytes / warkes / and occupacyo^s / have a wonders great
study and labor / of the which auctorytees / occupacyons / and warkes / were
at this time to long to write / wherefore I remyt that book as mine auctour
thereof. The which book were necessary to be known of every deg^ee / that they
might do and order them self according to the same. And in so much the yemen
in the said moralytees and game of y^ chesse be set before to labor / defend
and maynteyne all y^ other hyer estates / the which yemen represent the common
people / as husbands and laborers / therefore I purpose to speak first of
husbandry.

The book of husbandry.
Here begins the book of husbandry / and first whereby husband men do live.
THe most general living that husbands can have / is by plowynge and sowynge
of their corns / and rerynge or bredynge of their catell / and not the one
without the other. Than is the ploughe ye most necessaryest instrument ye an
husband can occupye / wherefore it is co^uenyent to be known how a plow should
be made.

Diverse manners of plowes.
THere be plowes of diverse makynges in diverse contrees / and likewise there be
plowes of yren of diverse facyons. And that is because there be many manner of
grounds and soil. Some white clay / some reed clay / some gravel / some
chylturne / some sand / some mean earth / some meddled with marle / and in
many places hethe ground / and one ploughe will not serve in all places.
wherefore it is necessary to have diverse manner of plowes. In Sommerset shyre
about zelcestre / the sharbeame that in many places is called the ploughe head
/ is four or five foot long / and it is broad and thyn. And that is because
the land is very toughe / and would soke the plough into the earth if the
sharbeame were not long / broad / and thynne. In Kente they have other manner
plowes / some god with wheles / as they do in many other places / and some will
turn the sheldbrede at every lands end / and plowe all one way. In
Buckyngham shyre are plowes made of another manner / and also other manner of
ploughe yrens / the which me seems generally good and lykely to serve in many
places / and specially if the plough beam and sharbeame were four inches
longer between the shethe and the plough tail / that the sheldbrede might com
more a slope / for those plowes give out to suddenly / and therefore they be the
worse to draw and for no cause else. In Leceytre shyre / Lankesshyre /
yorkeshyre / Lyncoln / Norfolk / Cambrige shyre / and many other countries /
the plowes be of diverse makynges / the which were to long a process to
declare how etc. But how so ever they be made / if they be well tempered and go
well / they may be the better suffered.

To know the names of all the parts of the plow.
MEn that be no husbands may fortune to read this book / that knows not
which is ye plow beam / the share beam / the ploughe shethe / the plow tail
/ the stylte / the rest / the shield breed / the fenbrede / the roughe staves
/ the plough foot / the plough ear or coke / the share / the culture / and the
plough mall / Perauenture I do give them these names here / as is used in my
country / and yet in other contreys they have other names / wherforey^ shall
know that the plough beam is the long tree above / the which is a little
bent / the share beam is the tree underneath / whereupon the share is set / the
plough sheth is a thyn piece of dry wode made of oak / that is set fast in a
mortays in the ploughe beam / and also into the sharbeme / the which is the
key and the chief band of all the ploughe. The plough tail is that y^
husband holds in his hand and the hinder end of the ploughe beam is put
in a long slyt made in the same tail and not set fast / but it may rise up
and go down / and is pynned behind / and the same plough tail is set fast in
a morteis in the hinder end of the sharbeame. The plough stylt is on y^ right
side of the ploughe / where upon the rest is set / the rest is a lyttel piece of
wodpynned fast upon ye nether end of the stylte / and to the sharbeame in the
ferther end. The sheldebred is a broad piece of wode fast pynned to the right
side of the shethe in the farther end and to the utter side of the stylte in
the hinder end. The fen bread is a thyn board / pynned or nailed most comynly
to the lift side of the shethe in the farther end / and to the ploughe end in
the hinder end. And the said sheldebrede would com over the said shethe and
fenbrede an ynche / and to come paste the mids of the share / made with a
sharp edge / to receive and turn the earth when the culture has cut it /
There be two roughe staves in every plough in the hinder end / set a slope
between the plough tail and the stylte / to hold out and keep the ploughe
abroad in the hinder end / and the one longer than the other. The ploughe foot
is a little piece of wode with a crooked end set before in a morteys in the
ploughe beam / set fast with wedges to drive up and down / and it is as a
stay to order of what depenes the ploughe shall goo. The ploughe care is made
of three pyeces of iron / nailed ^aste v^ to the right side of the ploughe
beam. And pore men have a crooked piece of wode pynned fast to the plough beam.
The share is a piece of iron sharp before and broad behind / a foot long /
made with a socket to be set on the ferther end of the share beam / the
culture is a bend piece of yren set in a morteys in the mids of the plough
beam / fastened with wedges on every side / and the back thereof is half an
ynche thycke and more / and three inches broad / and made ^ene before to cut the
earth clean / and it must be well steeled / and that shall cause the easyer
draughte / and the yrens to last much longer. The ploughe mall is a piece of
hard wode / with a pynne put thrughe set in the ploughe beam / in an augurs
bore.

The temprynge of plowes.
NOw the plowes be made of diverse manners / it is necessary for an husband to
know how these plowes should be tempered* to plowe and turn clean / and to
make no rest balkes. A rest balke is where the plough byteth at the point of
the culture and share / and cutteth not the ground clean to the forowe that
was plowed last before / but leueth a little rydge stan dynge between / the
which does bread thystyls and other wedes. All these manner of plowes should
have all like one manner of temperynge in the yrens. How be it a man may temper
for one thing in two or three places as for depnes. The foot is one / the
setting of the culture of a depnes is an other / and the third is at y^
ploughe tail / where be two wedges y^ be called slot^ wedges / the one is the
slote above the beam / an other in the said slote under the ploughe beam /
and other while he will set both above or both underneath / but always let him
take good head and keep one general rule of the hinder end of the sharebeame
do always touch the earth / that it may kill a word / or else it goth not truly.
The temperynge to go broad and narow is in the setting of the culture and with
the dryuynge of his side wedges / fore wedge / and hele wedge / which would be
made of dry wode / and also y^ setting on of his share helps well / and is a
conning point of husbandrye / and mendeth and payreth much plowyng / but it
is so narow a point to know that it is hard to make a man to understand it by
writing without he were at y^ operacyon thereof to teache me^ the practyue / for
it must lean much into the forowe / and the point may not stand to much up
nor down / nor to much in to the land nor into the forow. How beit the
setting of the culture helps much. Some plowes have a bend of yren
tryanglewyse set there as the plough ear should be that has three nyckes on y^
farther side. And if he will have his ploughe to goo a narowe forowe / as a
sede forow should be / than be sets his foot teame in the nycke next to the
plough beam / and if he will go a mean bread / he settyth it in the mydle
nycke that is best for sturrynge / and if he would go a broad forow / he sertyth
it in the vttermoste nycke / that is best for falowynge. The which is a good
way to keep the bread and sone tempered / but it serves not the depnes. And
some men have instead of y^ ploughe foot a piece of iron set up right in the
farther end of the plough beam / * and they call it a coke / made with two or
three nyckes and that serves for depnes. The ploughes that goo with wheles have
a straight beam / and may be tempered in the iron as the other be for the
bread / but their most special temper is at the bolster / where as the
ploughe beam lies / and that serves both for depenes and for bread. And they
be good on even ground that lies light / but me seems they be far more
costlye than the other plowes. And though these plowes be well tempred for one
manner of ground / that temper will not serve in an other manner of ground /
but it must rest in the dyscressyon of the husband to know when it gothe well.

The necessary things that belongs to a plowe / carte / and wayne.
BUt or he begin to plowe he must have his plough and his ploughe yren / his
oxen or horses / and the get that belongs to them / that is to say / bows
/ yokes / lands / stilkynges / wrethyng temes. And or he shall lode his corn
he must have a wayne / a copyoke / a pair of sleues / a wayne rope / and a
pytchforke. This wayne is made of diverse pieces that will have great reparacion
/ that is to say / the wheles / and those be made of nathes / spokes / felyes /
and doubles / and they must be well ^ettered with wode or yren / and if they
be yren bound they are much the better / and though they be the derer at
first / yet at length they be better chepe / for a pair of wheles yren bound
will were. vii. or. viii. pair of other wheles / and they goo round and light
after oxen or horses to draw. How be it on mareys ground and soft ground the
other wheles be better / because they be brother on y^ soul / and will not go
so deep, They must have an axyltre clout with viii. wayncloutes of yren.ii.
lynpynes of yren in the axyltre ends.ii. axyll pynnes of yren / or else of
tough hard wode. The body of the wayne of oak / the staves / the nether rathes
/ the over rathes / the cross somer / y^ keys and pykstaues. And if he go with
a horse plow / tha^ must he have his horses / or mares / or both his ho^bers or
collers / holmes whyted / tresses / swyngleters and togewith. Also a cart made
of asshe / because it is light and like stuff to it as is to a wayne / and
also a cart sadell / bacbandes and belly bands / and a cart ladder be hynde /
when he shall carry either corn or kyddes / or such other. And in many contreys
their waynes have carte ladders both behind and before. Also an husband must
have an axe / a hachet / a hedgyngbyll / a pyn augur / a rest augur / a flayle
/ a spade / and a shouell.

And how be it that I give them these names as is most commonly used in my
country / I know they have other names in other contreys / but herby a man may
parceyue many things belonging to husbandry to their great costs and
charges / for the mayntenaunce and vpholdynge of the same. And many mo things
are belonging to husbands than these as ye shall well perceive or I make an
end of this treatise. And if a young husband should bye all these things /
it would be to costly to him / wherefore it is necessary for him / to learn to
make his yokes / ox bows / stoles / and all manner of ploughe gere.

whether is better a plough of horses or a ploughe of Oxen.
IT is to be known whether is better a plough of horses or a ploughe of oxen /
and therein me seems ought to be made a distincyon. For in some places an ox
plough is better than a horse ploughe / and in some places a horse plough is
better / that is to say in every place where as the husband has several
pastures to put his oxen in when they come fro their warke / there is the ox
ploughe the better. For an ore may not endure his warke to labor all day /
and than to be put to the comyns or before the herdman / and than to be set in
a fold al night without meat / and go to his labor in the morning. But and
he be put in a good pasture all night / he will labor much of all y^ day
daily. And oxen will plowe in tough clay and upon hylly ground / where horses
will stand still: And where as is no several pastures / there y^ horse plowe
is better / for the horses may be teddered or tied upon ^^ys / balkes or hades
/ where as oxen may not be kept and it is not vsyd to tedder them / but in few
places. And horses will go faster than oxen on even ground or light ground /
and quycker in caryages / but they be far more costly to keep in winter / for
they must have be the heye and corn to eat / and straw for lytter / they must
be well shodde on all four fete / and the gere that they shall draw with is
more costely than for the oxen / and shorter while it will last. And the oxen
will cate but straw and a little hey / the which is not half the cost that
horses must have / and they have no shoes as horses have. And if any sora^ce
come to the horses / wax old / brysed or blind / than he is little worth.
And if any sora^ce come to an ox / wax old / brysed or blind / for two
shyllynges he may be fed / and than he is man's meet / and as good or better
than ever he was. And the horse when he dies is but carien. And therefore me
seems all things co^sydred the plough of oxen is much more profitable than
the plough of horses.

The dylygence and the attendaunce that a husband should give to his warke /
in manner of an other prologue / and the special ground of all this treatise.
THou husband y^ ente^dest to get thy living by husbandry / take heed to the
saying of the wise Philosopher / the wiche says. Adhibe curam / tene mensura^
/ et eris dives. That is to say / take heed to thy charge / keep measure / and
thou shall be rich And now to speak of the first article of these.iij. s.
Adhibe curam. He that will take upon him to do any thing and be slothful /
recheles / and not dilligent to execute nor perform that thing that he takes
upon him / he shall never thryue by his occupacyon. And to the same intent
says our lord in his gospel by a parable. Nemo mittens manum suam ad aratrum
respiciens retro / aptus est regnum dei. The spyrytuall co^struccyon of this
text. I remyt it to the doctors of diuynite / and to the great clerks / but
to reduce and bring the same text to my purpose. I take it thus. There is no
man puttyng his hand to the plough lo* king bakward / is worthy to have that
thing that he ought to have. For if he go to the ploughe and look bakward / he
sees not whether the plough go in ryge or rain / make a balke or go
overthwart. And if it so do / there will be little corn. And so if a man
attend not his husbandry / but go to sport or play / tavern or alehouse / or
slepynge at home / and such other idle warkes / he is not than worthy to have
any corn / and therefore. Fac quod venisti. Do that thou come for / and thou
shall find that thou sekest for.

How a man should plowe all manner of lands all times of the year.
NOw these plowes be made and tempered / it is to be known how a man should
plowe all times of the year. In the beginning of the year after the feste of
the Epyphany it is time for a husband to go to the plowe. And if thou have any
leys to falowe or to sow otes upon / first plow them that the grass and the
moss may rote / and plow them a deep square forowe. And in all manner of
plowynges se that thy eye / thy hand / and thy foot may agree / and be always
ready one to serve an other / and to turn up much molde and to lay it flat
that it rere not on edge. For if it rere on edge the grass and moss will not
rote. And if thou sow it with winter corn / as whete or rye / as much corn
as touches ye moss will be drowned / the moss does keep such wete in it
self. And in some contreys if a man plowe deep / he shall pass the good
ground and have but little corn / but that country is not for men to keep
husbandrye upon / but for to rere and bread catell or sheep / for else they must
go beat their lands with mattockes / as they do in many places of Corn wayle
/ and in some places of Deuenshyre.

To plowe for pese and beans.
HOw to plowe for pese and beans were necessary to know: First thou must
remember whychs is most cleye ground / and that plowe first / and let it lie
a good space or thou sow it / because the frost / y^ rain / the wind / and
the son may cause it to break small / to make much molde / and to rygge it.
And to plowe a square forowe / the bread / and the depnes all one / and to lay
it close to his fellow. For the more forowes the more corn / for a general
rule of all manner of corns. And that may be proved at the coming up of all
manner of corn to stand at the lands end and look toward the other end.
And than may ye se how the corn grows.

How to sow both pese and beans.
THou shall sow thy pese upon the cley ground and thy beans upon the barley
ground / for they would have ranker ground than pese. How be it some
husbands hold opinion / that bygge and styffe ground / as cleye / would be
sown with bygge ware / as beans / but me think the contrary / for and a dry
somer come / his beans will be short. And if the ground be good / put the
more beans to the pees and y^ better shall they yield / when they be
thresshed. And if it be very rank ground as is much at every town side /
where catell does resort / plowe not that land till ye will sow it / for and
ye do there will come up kedlokes and other wedes. And than sow it with beans
/ for and ye sow pees the kedlokes will hurt them / and when ye se seasonable
time sow both pees and benes / so that they be sown in the beginning of
March. How shall ye know seasonable time / go upon the land that is plowed /
and if it sing or cry or make any noise under thy fete / than it is to wete
to sow / and if it make no noise and will bear thy horses / than sow in the
name of god / but how to sow* Put thy pees in to thy hopper and cast a broad
thonge o^ ledder or of garthe web of an elne long / faste^ it to ^othe ends
of the hopper / and put it over thy heed like a leysshe. And stand in the
mids of the land where the sack lies / the which is most conuenye^t for
fyllynge of thy hopper / and set thy lift foot before and take an handful of
pees. And when thou take up thy right foot / than cast thy pees fro the all
abroad / and when thy lift foot ryseth take an other handful / and when thy
right foot ryseth than cast them fro the. And so at every two paces thou shalt
^owe an handful of pees / and so se that the foot and the hand agree / and
than ye shall sow even. And in your casting ye must open as well your fyngers
as your han^e ^ and the hyer and the farther that ye cast your corn / the
better shall it sprede / except it be a great wind. And if the land be very
good and will break small in the plowynge / it is better to sow after the
ploughe than tarry any longer.

Sede of dyscressyon.
THere is a sede that is called dyscressyon / and if a husband have of that
sede and myngle it among his other corns / they will grow much the better /
for that sede will tell him how many castes of corn every land ought to
have. And a young husband / and may fortune some old husband have not
suffycyent of that sede / and he that lacks let him borowe of his
neygheboures that have. And his neighbors be unkind if they will not lend
this young husband part of this sede. For this sede of dyscrecyon has a
wonders property / for the more that it is taken of or lent of / the more it
is. And therefore me seems it should be more spyrytuall than temporal / wherein
is a great dyuersyte / for a temporal thing the more it is divided the less
it is / and a spyrytuall thing the more it is divided the more it is. Uerbi
gratia. For ensample. I put case a wife bring a lofe of breed to y^ church to
make holy bread / when it is cut in many small pieces and holy bread made thereof
/ there may be so many men / women / and children in the church / that by that
time that the priest has dealt to every one of them a little piece / there
shall never a crum be left in the hamper. And a spu^all thing as a P^ n^ or
prayer that any man can say / let him teache it to. xx. a. C. or to a. M. yet is
the prayer never the less but much more. And so / this sede of dyscressyon is
but wisdom and ^eason / and he that has wisdom / reason / and dyscressyon
may teache it and inform other men as he is bound to do / wherein he shall have
thank of god / and he does but as god has commanded him by his gospel
(Quod grat^ accepistis) gratis date* That thing that ye took freely / give it
freely again / and yet shall ye have never the less.

How all manner corn should be sown.
BUt yet me thinks it is necessary to declare how all manner of corn should
be sown / and how much upon an acre most commonly / and first of pese and
benes. An acre of ground by the statute / that is to say. xvi. foot and a
half to the perch or pole / four perches to an acre in bread / and. xl.
perches to an acre in length / may be metely well sown with two London
bussshels of pees / the which is but two strykes in other places. And if there
be the fourth part beans than will it have half a London busshell more / and
if it ^ehalfe benes it will have three London busshels / and if it be all benes
/ it will have four London busshels fully / and that is half a quarter.
Because the benes be great and grow up straight / and do not sprede and go
abroad as pese do. An acre of good beans is worth an acre and a half of good
pees / because there will be more busshels. And the best property that
belongs to a good husband / is to sow all manner of corn thycke enough /
and specially benes and barley for comynly they be sown upon rank ground /
and good ground will have the burden of corn or of wede. And as much
plowynge and harowynge has an acre of ground and sow thereupon but one
busshell / as and he sowed four busshels. And undoubted one busshell may not
give so much corn again as the four busshels / though the three busshelles
that he sowed more be allowed and set apart. And one busshell and an half of
white pees or grene pease / will sow as much ground as two busshels of gray
pese / and that is because they be so small the husband needs not to take so
great an handefull. In some contreys they begin to sow pese sone after
Christmas / and in some places they sow both pese and beans under forow /
and those of reason must be sown betyme. But for the most generalyte to begin
sone after Candelmasse is good season / so that they be sown or the beginning
of March or sone upon. And specially let them be sown in the old of the moon.
For thopynyon of old husbands is / that they should the better codde and the
sooner be ripe. But I speak not of hasty pese^ for they be sown before
Chrystmas.

To sow barley.
Every good husband has his barley falowe well donged and lyenge rygged all
the deep and ^olde of winter / y^ which ryggynge makes y^ land to be dry /
and the dongynge makes it to be melowe and rank, And if a dry season com
before Candelmasse or sone after / it would be cast down and water forowed
between the lands / that the wete rest not in the rain / and in the
beginning of March rygge it up again / and to sow in every acre syue London
busshelles / or four at the leest / and some years it may so fortune that
there comes no seasonable wether before March to plowe his barleye earth. And
as soon as he has sown his pees and beans / than let him cast his barley
earth / and shortly after to rygge it again so that it be sown before Apryll.
And if the year time be past / than sow it upon the casting. It is to be
noted that there be three manner of barleys / that is to say / sprot barley /
long ear / and bear barley / that some men call bygge. Sprot barley has a
flat ear most como^ly / three quarters of an inche broad / and three inches
long / and the corns be very great and white / and it is the best barley /
Long ear has a flat ear half an ynche broad / and four inches and more of
lenght. But the corn is not so great nor so white / and sooner it will turn
and grow to the otes. Bear barley or bygge would be sown upon light and dry
ground / and has an ear three inches of length or more / set four square
like pecke whete / small corns and little flower / and that is the worst
barley / and four London busshels are suffycyent for an acre. And in some
contreys they do not sow their barley till May / and that is most comynly
upon gravel or sandy ground. But that barley generally is never so good as
that y^ is sown in March. For if it be very dry wether after it be sown /
that corn that lies above lies dry and has no moisture and that that lies
underneath comes up / and when rain comes than sprytteth that that lies
above / and often times it is grene when the other is ripe / and when it is
thresshed there is much light corn.

To sow otes.
ANd in March it is time to sow otes and specially upon light ground and
dry / how be it they will grow on weter ground than any corn else for wete
ground is good for no manner of corn / and three London busshels will sow an
acre. And it is to be known that there be three manner of otes / that is to say
/ read otes / black otes / and roughe otes. Read otes are the best otes / and
when they be thresshed they be yelow in y^ busshell / and very good to make
otemele of. Black otes are as great as they be / but they have not so much
flower in them / for they have a thycker husk and also they be not so good to
make otemele of.

The rough otes be the worst otes / and it quyteth not the cost to sow them /
they be very light and have long tails / whereby they will hang each one to
other. All these manner otes wear the ground very sore / and makes it to be
quyche. A young husband ought to take heed how thycke he sows all manner of
corn two or three years / and to se how it comes up, and whether it be thycke
enough or not / and if it be thyn / sow thycker the next year / and if it be
well / hold his hand there other years / and if it be to thyn / let him
remember him self whether it be for the vnsesonablenes of the wether / or fere
of thyn sowynge. And so his wisdom and dyscressyon must dyscerne it.

To harow all manner of corns.
NOw these lands be plowed and the corns sowe^ it is convenient that they be
well harowed / or else crows / douues / and other birds will eat and bear
away the corns. It is used in many contreys husbands to have an ox harowe /
the which is made of six small pyeces of tymbre called harowe bulls made
either of asshe or oak / they be two yardes long and as much as the small of
a man's leg / and have shotes of wood put thrughe them like lathes / and in
every bull are six sharp pieces of yren / called harow tyndes / set some what a
slope forward / and the formoste slote must be bygger than the other /
because the foot teame shall be fastened to the same with a shakell or a with to
draw by. This harowe is good to break the great clottes / and to make much
molde / and than the horse harowes to come after to make the clottes smaller /
and to lay the ground even. It is a great labor and pain to the oxen to go
to harow / for they were better to go to the plowe two days than to harowe one
day. It is an old saying / the ox is never woe / till he to the harow go. And
it is because it gothe by wytches / and not always after one draught. The horse
harow is made of fine bulls / and pass not an elle of length / and not so
much as the other / but they be like sloted and tynded. And when the corn is
well covered / than it is harowed enough. There be horse harowes that have
tyndes of wode / and those be used much about Ryppon and such other places
where be many bulder stones / for these stones would wear the yren to sone /
and those tyndes be most commonly made of the ground end of a young asshe /
and they be more than a foot long in y^ beginning / and stand as much above
the harowe as benethe. And as they wear or break they drive them down lower /
and they would be made long before or they be occupied that they may be dry /
for than they shall endure and last much better and stycke the faster. The
horses that shall draw these harowes must be well kept and shodde or else they
will sone be tired / and sore beat / that they may not draw. They must have
hombers or collers / holmes withed about their necks / tresses to draw by /
and a swyngletre to hold the tresses abroad / and a togewith to be between y^
swyngleter and the harow. And if the barley ground will not break with harowes
but be clotty it would be beaten with malles / and not straight down for than
they beat the corn into the earth. And if they beat the clot on the side it
will the better break. And y^ clot will lie light y^ the corn may lightly
come up. And they use to role their barley ground after a shoure of rain / to
make the ground even to mow.

To falowe*
NOw these husbands have sown their pease beans / barley and otes / and
harowed the^ / it is the best time to falow in the latter end of March and
Apryll / for whete / rye / and barley. And let the husband do the best he can
to plowe a broad forow and a deep / so that he turn it clean and lay it flat /
that it rere not on the edge / the which shall destroy all the thystyls and
wedes. For the deper and the brother that he gothe / the more new molde / and
the greater clottes shall he have / and the greater clottes the better whete /
for the clottes keep the whete warm all winter / and at March they will melte
and break and fall in many small pyeces / the which is a new dongynge and
refresshynge of the corn. And also there shall but little wedes grow upon the
falowes that are so falowed / for the ploughe goth underneath the rotes of all
manner of wedes / and turns the rote upward that it may not grow / and if
the land be falowed in winter time it is far the worse for three pryncypall
causes / One is / all the rain that comes shall wasshe the land and drive
away the dounge and the good molde^ that the land shall be much the worse. An
other cause the rayn shall beat the land so flat / bake it so hard to gyder
that if a dry May come / it will be to hard to stere in the month of June.
And the third cause is / The wedes shall take such rote or sterynge time com /
that they will not be clean turned underneath / the which shall be great hurt to
the corn when it shall be sown and specially in the time of wedynge of the same
/ and for any other thing make a deep holow forow in the rydge of the land /
and look well thou rest balke it not / for and thou do / there will be many
thystyls / and than thou shall not make a clean rydge at the first steryng and
therefore it must needs be dep^plowed / or else that shall not turn the wedes
clean

To carry out donge or mucke and to sprede it.
ANd in the later end of Apryll and the begin nynge of May is time to carry
out his donge or muke / and to lay it upon his barley ground. And where he
has barley this year / sow it with whete or rye the next time it is falowed
/ and so shall he mucke all his lands over at every second falowe. But that
husband that can find the means to carry out his donge / and to lay it upon
his land after it be ones sturred / it is much better than to lay it upon
his falowe for diverse causes. One is / if it be laid upon his falowe all that
falls in the holowe rygge shall do little good / for when it is rygged again /
it lies so deep in the earth it will not be plowed up again / except that
when he has spread it / that he will with a shouell or a spade cast out all
that is fallen in the rygge. And if it be laid upon the sturynge / at every
plowynge it shall meddle the donge and the earth together / the which shall
cause the corn much better to grow and encreace. And in some places they lode
not their donge till harvest be done / and that is used in the farther side of
Darbysshyre / called Scaresdale / Halomshyre / and so northwarde toward ^orke
and Ryppon / and that I call better than upon the falowe / and specially for
barley / but upon the first sturrynge is best for whete and rye / and that his
donge be laid upon small hepes nyghtogyder / and to sprede it euenly and to
leave no dong there as the mucke hepe stood / for the moystnes of the donge
shall cause the ground to be rank enough. And if it be meddled witherth / as
sh^lynges and such other / it will last the longer / and better for barley than
for whete or rye / because of wedes. Horse donge is the worst donge that is.
The dong of all manner cattle that chewe their cudde is very good And the donge
of douues is best / but it must be laid on the ground very thynne.

To set out the sheep fold.
ALso it is time to set out the shepefolde in May and to set it upon the rye
ground / if thou have any / and to flyt it every morning or night / and in
the morning when he comes to his fold / let not his sheep out anon / but
reyse them up and let them stand still a good season / that they may donge and
pysse. And go among them to se whether any of them have any mathes / or be
scabbed / and se them three or four times on the one side / and as often on the
other side. And when the kelles be gone beside the ground / than let them out
of the fold / and drive them to the soundest place of the field, But he that
has a falowe feelde several to him self / let him occupy no fold / for
foldyng of sheep makes them scabbed / and bredethmathes / and when a storm of
ill wether comes in the night they can not fly nor go away / and that
appeyreth them sore of their flesh. But let that man that has such a
several falowe field / let him drive.rx. or.xxx. or.xl. stakes according to
the no^bre of his sheep upon his falow where he would set his field / and
specially in the farthest part of the field from thens as they com in / for the
going upon does much good. And let the shepard bring his sheep to the stakes
/ and the sheep will rub the^ on the stakes. And let the sheparde go about
them till they be set / and thus serve them two or three nyghtes / and they will
follow those stakes as he flytteth them and sit by them. And if any ill wether
come / they will rise up and go to the hedge. And this manner of foldyng shall
bread no mathes nor scabbes / nor apeyre the^ of their flesh / and shall be a
great save guard to the sheep for rottynge / and in the morning put them out
of their pasture / and thou shall not need to bye any hurdels nor shepeflekes /
but how ye shall salve them or dress them ye shall understand it in the
chapyter of sheep after.

To carry wode and other necessaryes.
ANd in May wha^ thou have falowed thy ground and set out thy shepefolde and
carried out thy dong or muke / if thou have any wode / cole or tymbre to carry /
or such other besynes that must needs be don with thy carte or wayne / than is
it time to do it. For than the way is like to be fair and dry / and the
days long / and that time the husband has leeste to do in husbandry.
Perauenture I set one thing to be done at one time of the year / and if the
husband should do it / it should be a greater loss to him in an other thing
/ wherefore it is most conuenyent to do that thing first that is most
profitable to him / and as soon as he can / to do the other labor.

To know diverse manner of wedes.
IN the later end of May and the beginning of June / is time to wede thy
corn. There be diverse manner of wedes / as thystyls / kedlokes / dockes /
cocledrake / darnolde / gouldes / haudodes / dog^enell / mathes / terre / and
diverse other small wedes. But these be they that grieve most. The thystyll is
an ill wede rough and sharp to handell / and freteth away the corns nygh it
/ and causes the sterers not to shere clean. Kedlo kes has a lefe like rapes
/ and bears a yelowe flower / and is an ill wede / and grows in almaner
corn / and has small coddes / and grows like mustarde sede. Dockes have a
broad lefe / and diverse high spyres / and very small sede in the top. Cockole
has a long small lefe / and will bear. v. or. vi. flowers purple color as
broad as a grote / and the sede is round and black / and may well be suffered
in breed corn / but not in sede / for therein is much flower. Drake is like
unto rye till it begin to ^ede / and it has many seeds like fenell seeds and
hangs downwarde / and it may well be suffered in breed / for there is much
flower in the sede / and it is an opinyon that it comes of rye. and ce.
Dernolde grows up straight like an hye grass / and has long seeds on
either side the sterte / and there is much flower in that sede / and grows
much among barley / and it is said that it comes of small barley. Goldes
has a short iagged lefe / and grows half a yard high / and has a yelowe
flower as broad as a grote / and is an ill wede / and grows comynly in barley
and pees. Hawdod has a blewe flower and a few little leaves / and has five or
six branches floured in the top / and grows comynly in rye upon lean
ground / and does little hurt. Dogsenell and mathes is both one / and in
the coming up is like fenell / and bears many white flowers with a yelowe
sede / and it is the worst wede that is / except terre / and it comes most
comynly when great wete comes shortly after y^ corn be sown. Terre is the
worst wede / and it never does appear till the month of June / and specially
when there is great wete in that moan or a little before / and grows most in
rye / and it grows like fytches / but it is much smaller / and it will grow
as hye as the corn / and with the weight thereof it pulls the corn flat to
the earth and freteth the ears away. wherefore I have seen husbands mow down
the corn and it together. And also with sharp hokes to repe it as they do pees
and made it dry / and than it will be good fodder. There be other wedes not
spoken of / as dee / nettyls / dodder / and such other do much harm.

How to wede corn.
NOw it would be known how these corns should be weded. The chief instrument to
wede with is a pair of tongues made of wode / and in y^ farther end it is
nycked to hold the wede faster / and after a shoure of rain it is best
wedynge / for than they may be pulled up by y^ rotes / and than it comes never
again And if it be dry wether / tha^ must ye have a wedyng hoke with a socket
set upon a little staff of a yard long / and this hoke would be well steeled
and ground sharp both behind and before. And in his other hand he has a
forked stycke a yard long / and with his forked stycke he puts the wede from
him and he puts y^ hoke beyond the rote of the wede and pulls it to him
and cutteth y^ wede fast by y^ earth / and with his hoke he takes up the wede
and casts it in the reyne / and if y^ reyne be full of corn it is better to
stand still when it is cut and wydre / but let him beware y^ he trede not to
much upon the corn and specially after it be shot / and when he cutteth the
wede y^ he cut not the corn / and therefore the hoke would not pass an inche
wide. And when y^ wede is so short that he can not with his forked pyke put it
fro him / and with y^ hoke pull it to him / than must he set his hoke upon the
wede fast by the earth and put it fro him / and so shall he cut it clean. And
with these two instruments he shall never stoop at his wacke. Dogfenell /
goldes mathes and kedlokes are ill to wede after this manner / they grow upon so
many branches hard by the earth and therefore they use most to pull them up with
their hands / but look well y^ they pull not up y^ corn with all / but as for
terre there will no wedynge serve.

The first sturrynge.
ALso in June is time to rygge up thy falowe / the which is called the first
sturrynge / and to ^lowe it as deep as he can for to turn the rotes of the
wedes upward / that the son and y^ dry wether may kill them. And an husband
can not co^uenye^tly plow his land and lode out his donge both upon a day
with one draught of bestes / but a husband may well lode out his donge before
none / and to lode hey or corn at after none / or he may plow before none /
and lode hey or corn after none with the same draught / and no hurt to the
cattle / because in lodynge of hey or corn the cattle is always eating or
beytynge / and so they can not do in lodynge of donge and plowynge.

To mow grass.
ALso in y^ later end of June is time to begin to mow / if thy medowe be well
grown / but how so ever they be grown in July they must needs mow for diverse
causes. One is / it is not conuenyent to have hey and corn both in occupacyon
at one time An other is the younger and the grener that the grass is / the
softer and the sweter it will be when it is hey / but it will have the more
wyddrynge / and the elder the grass is / the harder and dryer it is / and the
worse for all manner of catell / for the seeds be fallen which is in manner of
prouandre / and it is the harder to eat and chowe. And an other cause / if
dry wether come it will dry and burn upon the ground and wast it away.
Take heed thy mower mow clean and hold down the hinder hand of his sithe /
that he do not endente the grass / and to mow his swathe clean through to that
that was last mowe^ before / that he leave not a mane between / and specially in
the common medowe / but in the several medowe it makes the less charge / and
that the moldywarpe hills be spredde / and the styckes clean pyked out of thy
meadow in Apryll or in the beginning of May.

How forkes and rakes should be made.
A Good husband has his forkes and rakes made ready in the winter before / and
they would be got between Myghelmasse and Martylmasse / and beyked / and set
even to lie vpryght in thy hand / and than they will be hard / styffe and
dry. And when the husband sytteth by the fire and has nothing to do than
may he make them ready / and tothe the rakes with dry wethy wode / and bore the
holes with his wymble both above and under / and drive the tethe upward fast
and hard / and than wedge them above with dry wode of oak for that is hard /
and will drive and never come out. And if he get them in sap time al ye
beykyng and dryenge that can be had shall not make them hard and styffe / but
they will always be plyeng / for they be most comynly made of hasel and with /
and these be the trees that blome and specially hasell / for it begineth to
blome as soon as the lefe is fallen / and if the rake be made of grene wode /
the heed will not abide upon ye stele / and the teth will fall out when he has
most need to them / and let his warke and lose much hey. And se that thy rake
and forke lie vpryght in thy hand / for and the one end of thy rake or the
side of thy forke hang down ward than they be not handsome nor easy to work
with.

To tedde and make hey.
When thy meadows be mowed they would be well tedded and laid even upon the
ground / and if the grass be very thycke it would be shaken with hands / or
with a short pykforke / for good teddyng is ye chief point to make good hey /
for than shall it be wyddred all in like / or else not / and when it is well
wyddred on the ouersyde and dry / tha^ turn it clean before noone as soon as
the dew is gone. And if thou dare trust the wether / than let it lie so all
night / and on the next day turn it again before none / and toward night make
it in wyndrowes and than in small heycockes / and so to stand one night at the least and sweet / and on the next fair day cast it abroad again / and turn it
ones or twyse / and than make it in greater heycockes / and to stand so one
night or more / that it may vngyue and sweet / for and it swet not in ye
heycokes it will sweet in ye mow / and tha^ it will be dusty and not holsom
for horse / bestes / nor sheep. And when it stands in the cocks it is better
to lode / and the more hey may be loded at a lode / and the faster it will lie.
Quyche hey comes of a grass called crofote / and grows flat after the earth
/ and bears a yelowe flower half a yard high and more / and has many
knottes toward the rote / and it is ye best hey for horses and bestes / and
the swetest if it be well got / but it will have much more wyddrynge than
other hey / for else he will bepysse him self and wax hot / and after dusty.
And for to know when it is wydred enough / make a little rope of the same that
ye think should be most grenest / and twyne it as hard together by twene your
hands as ye can / and so being hard twon let one take a knyfe and cut it fast
by your hand / and the knottes will be moist if it be not dry enough / short
hey and ley hey is good for sheep and all manner of cattle if it be well get, A
man may speak of making of hey and getting of corn / but god dysposeth and
ordreth all things.

How rye should be shorn.
ANd in the later end of July or ye beginning of August is time to shere rye /
ye which would be shorn clean and fast bound. And in some places they mow it
/ ye which is not so good to the husbands profit / but it is y^ sooner done.
For when it is mowen it will not be so fast bound / and he can not gader it so
clean but there will be much lost / and takes more rome in y^ barn than
shorn corn does. And also it will not keep nor save it self fro rain or
ill weder wha^ it stands in the cover / as shorn corn will do.

How to shere whete.
wHete would be shorn clean and hard bound in like manner / but for a general
rule / take good head that the sherers of all manner of white corn cast not up
their hands hastily / for tha^ all the lose corn and the strawes that he
holds not fast i^ his hand flies over his head and are lost / and also it
will pull of the ears / and specially of the corns that be very ripe. In some
places they will shere their corns high to the entente to mow their stubble
/ either to thacke or to bren / if they so do they have great cause to take
good head of the sherers / for if the ears of the corn croke down to the
earth / if the sherer take not good head / and put up the ear or he cut the
straw / as many eres as be under his hoke or sycle fall to y^ earth and be lost
/ and when they mow the stubble it is great hyndrau^ce to the profit of the
ground. And in Sommerset shyre about zelcester and Martocke / they do shere
their whete very low / and all the whete straw that they purpose to make
thacke of / they do not threshe it but cut of the ears and bind it in sheues
/ and call it read / and therewith thacke their houses. And if it be a new house
/ they thack it under their foot / the which is the best and the surest
thackynge that can be of straw for crows and douues shall never hurt it.

To mow or shere barley and otes.
BArley and otesbe most commonly mowen / and a man or woman following the mower
with a hand rake half a yard long / with. vii. or. viii. tethe in his lift
hand / and a syckle in his right hand / and with the rake he gadereth as
much as will make a shefe / and than he takes the barleye or otes by ye
tops and pulls out as much as will make a band / and casts the band
from him on the land / and with his rake and his syckle takes up the barley
or otes / and layth the^ upon the band / and so ye barley lies vnbou^d three
or four days if it be fair weder / and than to bynd it. And when the barley
is led away the lands must be raked / or else there will be much corn lost /
and if the barley or otes lie / they must needs be shorn.

To repe or mow pees and branes.
PEse and beans be most comynly last reped or mowen of diverse manners / some
with syckles / some with hokes / and some with staff hokes. And in some places
they lay them on repes / and when they be dry they lay them to gydre on
hepes like hey cocks and never bind them. But the best way is when the
repes be dry to bind them / and to set them on the rydge of the land three
shreues to gydre / and look that your sheres / repers / nor mowers gelde not
your beans / that is to say / to cut thy beans so hye that the nethermost
codde grow still on the stalk / and when they be bound they are the more
redyer to lode and unload / to make a reke / and to take fro the mow to
thresshe. And so be not the repes.

How all manner of corns should be tythed.
NOw all these corns before specifyed be shorn mowed / reped bound up / and
laid upon the iydge of the land. Than let the husband take heed of gods
co^maundement^ and let him go to the end of his land and begin and tell.ix.
sheues / and let him cast out the.x. shefe in the name of god / and so to
peruse from land to land / till he have truly tythed all his corn. And
beware and take heed of the saying of our lord by his prophet Malachias /
the which says* Quia michi no^ dedis^^ decimas et premitias id circo in fame
^t penuria maledicti estis. That is to say / because ye have not given to me
your tithes and your first fruits therefore ye be cursyd and ponysshed with
hongre and penury. And according to that saint Austyn says. Da decimas
alioquin incides in decima^ partem angeloru^ qui de celo corruersit in infern^.
That is to say / give thy tithes truly / or else thou shall fall among y^ tenth
part of angels that fell from heaven in to hell the which is an hard word
to every man that ought to give tithes / and does not give them truly. But
saint Austyn says a confortable word again to the^ that give their tithes
truly / that is to say. Decime sunt tributa ege^tiu^ a^aru^. Tithes are
trybutes or rewards to nedy souls / and ferther he says. Si decima^ dederis
non solu^ habu^da^tia^ fruetuu^ recipies / sedetia^ sanitate^ corporis et ai^e
co^sequeris. That is to say / if thou have given thy tithes truly / thou shalt
not all only receive the profit and the habou^dau^ce of goods but also health
of body and soul shall follow. would to god that every man knew y^ hard
word of our lord by his prophet Malachias / and also the confortable words
of the holy saint Austyn. For than would I trust verily / that tithes should be
truly given.

How all manner of corn should be covered.
NOw these corns be shorn and bounden and the^ tithes cast out / it is time
to cover them / shoke them or half throue them / but covering is the best
way of all manner of white corn. And that is to set four sheues on one side
and four sheues on the other side / and two sheues above of the greatest bounden
hard nygh to y^ nether end / y^ which must be set upward and the top
downwarde sprede abroad to cover all y^ other sheues. And they will stand best
in wind / and save them self best in rain / and they would be set on y^
rydge of the land and the side sheues to lene together in the tops and wide
at the ground / that the wind may go through to dry them. Pees and beans
would be set on the rydge of the land three sheues together the tops upward
and wrythen together / and wide benethe / that they may the better wyddre.

To lode corn and mow it.
When all these corns be dry and wydred enough than lode the^ into the barn
/ and lay every corn by it self. And if it be a wete Harvest / make many
mowes / and if y^ have not housyng enough / tha^ it is better to lay thy pese
and benes without upon a reke than other corn / and it is better upon a
scaffolde than upon the ground / for tha^ it must be well hedged for swyne and
catell / and the ground will rotte the botom / and the scaffolde saves both
hedgynge and rotynge / but they must be well covered both. And the husband may
set sheep or catell under the same scaffolde / and will serve him instead of
an house / if it be well and surely made. etc.

The second sturrynge.
IN August and the beginning of September is time to make his second
sturrynge / and most comynly it is cast down and plowed a mayn forowe not to
deep nor to ebb / so he turn it clean. And if it be cast / it would be water
forowed between the lands there as the rain should be / and it will be the
dryer when the land should be sown. And if the lands lie high in the rydge /
and hye at the rain / and low in the mids of the side that the water may not
run easily in to the rain / as Ise daily in many places. Than let the
husband set his plowe.iii. or four foot fro the rydge / and cast all the
rydge on both sides / and wha^ the rydge is cast / set his plow there as he
began and rydge up the remenau^t of the land / and so is the land both cast
and rydged / and all at one plowynye. And this shall cause the land to lie
round when it is sown at the next time / and tha^ shall it not drown the
corn.

To sow whete or rye.
About Myghelmasse it is time to sow both whete and rye / whete is most
comynly sown under the forowe / that is to say / cast it upon y^ falow and
than plowe it under. And in some places they sow their whete upon their pease
stuble / the which is never so good as that that is sowe^ upon the falow / and
that is vled where they make falowe in a feelde every fourth year. And in
Essex they use to have a child to go in the forow before y^ oxen or horses /
with a bag or a hopper full of corn / and he takes his hand full of corn
/ by little and little casts it in the said forow / Me seems y^ child had
need have much dyscrecyon How be it there is much good corn / and rye is
most como^ly sown above and harowed / and two London busshels of whete and rye
will sow an acre. Some ground is good for whete / some for rye / and some is
good for both / and upon that ground sow blend corn that is both whete and
rye / which is the surest corn of growing / and good for the husbands
householdde.

And this whete that shall be meddeled with rye must be such whete as will
sone be ripe / and that is flaxe^ whete / polerde whete / or white whete. And
ye shall understand that there be diverse manner of whetes Flaxen whete has a
yelowe ear and bare without anys / and is the bryghtest whete in the
busshell*and will make the whytest breed / and it will wear the ground sore /
and is small straw and will grow very thycke / and is but small corn. Polerde
whete has no anis thycke set in the ear / and will soon fall out and is
greater corn and will make white breed / white whete is like polerde whete in
the busshell / but it has anys and the ear is four square and will make
white breed / and in Essex they call flaxen whete white whete. Reed whete has
a flat ear / an inche broad full of anis / and is the gretest corn / and the
brodest blades / and the gretest straw / and will make white breed / and is
the ruddest of color in ye busshell. English whete has a dunne ear / few
anis or none / and is the worst whete / save peeke whete. Peeke whete has a
reed ear / full of anis thyn set / and often times it is flyntered / that is to
says / small corn wryngeled and dried / and will not make white breed / but it
will grow upon cold ground.

To thresshe and wynowe corn.
THis whete and rye that thou shalt sow ought to be very clean of wede / and
therefore or thou thresshe thy corn open thy sheues and pyke out all manner of
wedes / and than thresshe it and wynowe it clean end so shall thou have good
clean corn an other year. And in some countries about London specyall^ / and
in Essex and Kent they do fan their corn / the which is a very good gyse and
a great sauegarde for shedyng of the corn. And wha^ thou shall sell it / if it
be well wynowed or fande / it will be sold the derer / and the light corn
will serve the husband in his house.

To sever pees / beans / and fytches,
When thou have thresshed thy pese and benes / after they be wynowed / and or
thou shall sow them or sell them let them be well reed with syues / and
severed in three parts the great fro the small / and thou shall get in every
quarter a London busshel or there about. For the small corn lies in the holow
and void places of y^ great beans / and yet shall the great benes be sold
as dear as and they were all to gyder or derer / as a man may prove by a
famylier ensample* Let a man bye. C. herynges. ii. herynges. a penny / and
another. C. herynges three for a penny / and let him selle these. CE. herynges
again. v. herynges for. i^. d. now has he lost. iiij. d. For. C. herynges
two for. j. d. cost. v. s. and. C. heryng^ iij. for a penye cost. iij. s. and.
iiij. d. the which is. viij. s. and. iiij. d. and when he sells. v. herynges
for. ij. d. xx. herynges comes but to. viii. d. and there is but. xii. score
herynges / and that is but. xij. grotes. and. xij. grotes. and that comes but
to. viij. s. and so he has lost iiii. d. and it is because there be not so
many bargeynes / for in the byenge of these. CC. herynges there be five score
bargeyns / and in the selling of the same there be but. xlviij. bargaynes /
and so is there is lost ten herynges / the which would have been two bargaynes
mo / and than it had been even and mete. And therefore he that byeth gross sale
/ and retayleth must needs be a wynner / and so shall thou be a loser if thou
sell thy pease / beans / and fytches to gyder / for than thou sellest gross
sale. And if thou sever them in three parts than thou do retayle / whereby
thou shall win.

Of sheep / and what time of the year the ra^mes should be put to the ewes.
AN husband can not well thryue by his corn without he have other catell /
nor by his cattle without corn / for else he shall be a byer / a borower / or a
beggar. And because y^ sheep in mine opynion is the most profitablest catell
that any man can have / therefore I purpose to speak first of sheep. Than first
it is to be known what time thou shall put thy ra^mes to thy ewes / and therein
I make a distyncion / for every man may not put to their ra^mes al at one time
/ for and they do / there will be great hurt and loss / for that man that has
the best sheep pasture for winter and sone spryngynge in the beginning of the
year / he may suffer his ra^mes to go with his ewes al times of the year / to
^^yssome or ride when they will / but for the common pasture it is time to put
to his ra^mes at the Exaltacy on of the holy cross / for than the bucke gothe
to the rotte / and so would the ra^me. But for the common husband that has no
pasture but the common feldes it is time enough at the fest of saint Mychael the
arcchangell. And for the pore husband of the peeke or such other that dwell
in hylly and high grounds that have no pastures nor common feeldes / but all
only the common hethe. Simon and Jude day is good time for them / and this is
the reasone why. An ewe goethe with lamb twentye wekes / and shall eyane her
lamb in the. xxi. weke / and if she have not conuenyent new grass to eat /
she may not give her lamb milk / and for want of milk there be many lambs
perys^hed and lost / and also for pouertye the da^mes will lack milk and
forsake their lambs / and so often times they dye both in such hard
contreys.

To make an ewe to love her lamb.
IF thy ewe have milk and will not love her la^me put her in a narowe place
made of bordes or of smothe trouse a yard wide / and put the lamb to her and
socle it / and if the ewe smite the lamb with her head / bynd her head with a
hey rope or a cord to the side of the pen / and if she will not stand side
long all the ewe and give her a little hey / and tie a dog by her that she
may se him / and this will make her to love her lamb shortly. And if thou
have lamb deed whereof the da^me has much milk / fley that lamb and tie
that skin upon an other lambs back that has a sorry da^me with little milk
/ and put the good ewe and that lamb to gydre in the pen / and in one hour
she will love that lamb / and than may thou take thy sorry weke ewe away /
and put her in an other place / and by this means thou may fortune to save her
life and thy lambs both.

what time lambs should be wayned.
IN some places they never sever their lambs from their damines / and that is
for to causes / One is / in the best pasture where y^ ra^mes go always with
their ewes there it needs not / for y^ da^mes will wax dry and wayne their
lambs them self. An other cause is / he that has no several and sound
pasture to put his lambs unto when they should be wayned he must either sell
them or let them souke as long as the da^mes will suffer them / and it is a
common saying that the lamb shall not rotte as long as it souketh^ except the
da^me want meat. But he that has several and sound pastures it is time to
wayne their lambs when they be. xvi. wekes old / or. xviii. at the farthest /
and the better shall the ewe take the ram again. And the poor man of the
peeke contreye and such other places where as they use to milk their ewes /
they use to wayne their lambs at. xii. wekes old / and tomylke their ewes
five or six wekes. etc. But those lambs be never so good as the other that
souke long and have meat enough.

To draw sheep and sever them in diverse places.
THan thou grasyer that have many sheep in thy pastures / it is co^uenyent for
ye to have a sheep fold made with a good hedge or a pale / the which will
receive all thy sheep esely that go in one pasture set between two of thy
pastures in a dry place / and ad ioynynge to the end of the same / make an
other little fold that will receive. lxxxx. sheep or mo / and both those
foldes must have either of them a gate in to either pasture / and at the end
of that fold make an other little fold that will receive. xl. sheep or mo /
and between every fold a gate. And when the sheep are in the great fold let.
xl. of them or there about come in to the myddle fold and steke the gate. And
than let the shepharde turn them and look them on every side / and if he se or
find any sheep that needs any helping or mendynge for any cause / let the
sheparde take that sheep with his hoke and put him in the little fold. And
when he has taken all that nedyth any mendynge / than put the other in to
whether pasture he will / and let in as many out of the great fold / and take
all those that need any handlynge and put them in to the little fold. And thus
peruse them all till he have done / and than let the shepeharde go belte /
grese / and handell all those that he has drawn / and than shall not the
great flock be tarried nor kept fro their meat / and as he has mended them
so put them in to their pasture*

To belte sheep.
IF any sheep raye or be fyled with donge about the tail / take a pair of
sheres and clyppe it away / and cast dry mouldes thereupon / and if it be in
the hete of the somer / it would be rubbed ever with a little terre to keep
away the flies. It is necessary that a shepharde have a board set fast to the
side of his little fold to lay his sheep upon when he handeleth them and an
hole bored in the board with an augur / and therein a grayned stake of two foot
long to be set fast / to hang his terre box upon / and than it stall not
fall. And a shepeharde should not go without his dog / his sheep hoke / a
pair of sheres / and his terre box / either with him or ready at his sheep
fold / and he must teache his dog to bark when he would have him to run
when he would have him / and to leave ronnynge when he would have him / or else
he is not a connyng shepeherde. The dog must learn it wha^ he is a whelpe or
else it will not be / for it is hard to make an old dog to stoop.

To grease sheep.
IF any sheep be scabbed / the shepeherde may perceive it by the bytyng /
rubyng / or scratchyng with his horn / and most comynly the woll will rise
and be thyn or bare in that place / than take him and shede y^ woll with thy
fyngers there as the scabbe is / and with thy finger lay a little terre there
upon / and stroke it a length in the bottom of the woll that it be not seen
above. And so shede the woll by and by and lay a little terre thereupon till
thou pass the sore / and than it will go no farther.

To meddle terre.
LEt thy terre be meddled with oil / gose grease or capons grease / these three
be y^ best / for these will make the terre to ro^ne abroad / butter and swynes
grease when they be molten are good / so they be not salt / for terre of him
self is to kene / and is a fretter and no healer / without it be meddled with
some of these.

To make brom salve.
A medicyne to salve poor men's sheep that think terre to costly / but I doubt
not but and rich men knew it they would use the same.

TAke a shete full of brom croppes / leaves / blossoms and all / and choppe
them very small / and than sethe them in a pan of. xx. gallons with rennynge
water / till it begin to wax thycke a gelly than take two pound of sheep
suet molten / and a potel of old pysse / and as much bryne made with salt /
and put all in to the said pan and stir it about / and tha^ streyne it
through an old cloth / and put it in to what vessel ye will / and if your
sheep be new clypped / than make it luke warm / and than wasshe your sheep
there with a sponge or a piece of an old mantell / or of faldynge / or such a
soft cloth or wolle / for spendyng to much of your salve. And at all times of
the year after ye may relent it and need require / and make wide s^eydes in the
woll of the sheep / and anoynte them with it / and it shall heal the scabbe
and kill the sheep lyce / and it shall not hurt the woll in the sale thereof.
And those that be wasshen will not take scabbe after (if they have suffycyent
meet) for that is the best grease that is to a sheep to grease him in the mouth
with good meet / the which is also a great sauegarde to y^ sheep for rottyng
/ except there come myldewes / for he will chose ye best if he have plenty. And
he that has but a few sheep moderate this medicyne according.

If a sheep have mathes.
IF a sheep have mathes ye shall perceive it by her bytyng or fyskyng or
shaking of her tail and most comynly it is moist and wete / and if it be nygh
unto the tail it is often times grene and fyled with his donge / and than the
shepeherde must take a pair of sheres and clyppe away the woll bare to the
s^ynne / and take a hand full of dry mouldes and cast the mouldes thereupon to
dry up the wete / and than wype away the mouldes / and lay terre there as
the mathes were and a little farther. And thus look them every day / and mende
them if they have need.

Blyndenes of sheep and other dyseases / and remedies therefore.
THere be some sheep that will be blind a season and yet mende again. And if
thou put a little terre in his eye / he will mende ye rather. There be diverse
waters and other medecyns would mende him / but this is the most common medecyn
that shepardes use.

The worm in a shepes foot / and help therefore.
THere be some sheep that have a worm in his foot that makes them to halte.
Take ye sheep and look between his clese / and there is a little hole as much
as a great pynnes head / and therein grows five or six black hears like an
ynche long and more take a sharp poynted knyfe and slytte the skin a
quarter of an ynche long above the hole / and as much benethe / and put his
one hand in the holowe of the foot under the hinder clese / and set his thombe
above almost at the slytte and thrust his fyngers underneath forward / and
with your other hand take y^ black hears by the end / or with the knyues
point / and pull the hears a little and a little / and thrust after his other
hand with his finger and his thombe / and there will com out a worm like a
piece of flesh nygh as much as a little finger. And wha^ it is out / put a
little tar into the hole / and it will be shortly hole.

The blod / and remedy if he com bytyme.
THere is a sycknes among sheep is called the blood / that sheep that has
that will dye suddenly / and or he dye he will stand still and hang down the
head and otherwhyse quake. If the shepharde can espy him / take him and rub
him about the head / and specially about his eres / and under his eyes / and
with a knyfe cut of his eres in the mids / and also let him blood in a vain
under his eyes / and if he blede well / he is like to live / and if he blede
not than kill him and save his flesh / for if he dye ^y him self / the
flesh is lost / and the skin will be far ru^ dyer like blood more than an
other skin shall be. And it takes most como^ly of y^ fattest and best
liking.

The pockes / and remedy therefore.
THe pockes appear upon y^ skyn / and are like read pymples as broad as a
fardynge and there will dye many. And the remedy therefore is to handyll all thy
sheep / and to look on every part of their bodies / and as many as ye find
taken therwi^h / put them in fresshe new grass / and keep them fro their
fellows / and to look his flock often / and draw them as they need. And if it
be in summer time that there be no frost / than wasshe them. How be it some
shepehardes have other medecyns.

The wode evil / and remedy therefore
THere is a sekenes among sheep / is called the wode evil / and that comes
in the spring of the year / and takes them most commonly in the legs or in
the neck / and makes them to halt / and to hold their necks awry. And the
most part that have that sekenes will dye shortly in a day or two. The best
remedy is to wasshe them a little / and to change their ground and to bring
them to low ground and fresshe grass. And that sekenes is most commonly on
hylly ground / ^^y ground / and ferny ground. And some men use to let them
blood under the eye in a vain for yt same cause.

To wasshe sheep.
IN June is time to shere sheep / and or they be shorn / they must be very
well wasshen / the which shall be to the owner great profit in the sale of his
woll / and also to the cloth maker / but yet beware that thou put not to many
sheep in a pe^ne at one time nether at the washing nor at the sherynge / for
fere of murtherynge or over pressynge of their fellows / and that none go away
till he be clean washen / and se that they that hold the sheep by the head in
the water / hold his head hye enough for drownynge.

To shere sheep.
Take heed of ye sherers for touching the sheep with the sheres / and
specially for pryckynge with the point of the sheres / and that ye shepeharde be
always ready with his tarboxe to salve them. And se that they be well marked /
both ere mark / pytche mark / and radell mark / and let the woll be well
folden or wou^de^ with a woll wynder that can good skyll thereof / the which
shall do much good in the sale of the same.

To draw and sever the badde sheep from the good.
When thou have all shorn thy sheep / it is than best time to draw them / and
so sever them in diverse sorts. The sheep that thou wylt feed by them self /
the ewes by them self / the share hogs / and theyues by them self / the
lambs by them self / wedders and the ra^mes by them self / if thou have so
many pastures for them / for the byggest will beat the weykest with his head.
And of every sort of sheep / it may fortune there be some that like not and be
weke / those would be put in fresshe grass by them self / and when they be a
little mended? than sell them / and often change of grass shall mende all
manner of cattle.

what thing rotteth sheep.
IT is necessary that a shepeharde should know what thing rotteth sheep /
that he might keep them the better. There is gras called sperewort / and has
a long narowe lefe like a spear head / and it will grow a foot high / and
bears a yelow flower as broad as a penny / and it grows always in low places
where the water is used to stand in winter. An other grass is called penny
grass / and grows low by the earth in a marsshe ground / and has a lefe
as broad as a penny of two pens / and never bears flower. All manner of grass
that the land flode ronneth over is very ill for sheep because of the sand
and fylthe that stycketh upon it. All marreys ground and marasshe ground is
ill for sheep / the gras that grows upon falowes is not good for sheep / for
there is much of it wede / and oftentimes it comes up by the rote / and that
brings earth with it / and they eat both. etc. Myldewe grass is not good
for sheep / and that shall ye know to ways. One is by the leaves on the trees in
a morning / and specially of oaks / take the leaves and put thy tongue to them /
and thou shalt feel like honey upon them / and also there will be many kelles
upon the grass / and that causes the myldew. wherefore they may not well be
let out of the fold till the son have domynacyo^ to dry them away. Also
hunger rotte is the worst rotte that can be / for there is nether good flesh
nor good skin / and that comes for lack of meat / and so for hunger they
eat such as they can find / and so will not pasture sheep / for they seldom
rote but with myldewes / and than they will have much talowe and flesh / and
a good skin. Also white sneles be ill for sheep in pastures and in falowes.
There is an other rotte is called pelte rotte / and that comes of great wete
/ specially in wode contreys where they can not dry.

To know a rotten sheep diverse manner wayess whereof some of them will not fail.
TAke both your hands and twyrle upon his eye and if he be ruddy and have
read stryndes in the white of the eye / than he is sound / and if the eye be
white like talowe and the stryndes dark colored / than he is rotten. And also
take the sheep and open the woll on the side / and if the skin be of ruddy
color and dry / than is he sou^de / and if it be pale colored and watrye /
than is he roten. Also when ye have opened the woll on the side / take a little
of the woll between thy finger and thy thombe and pull it a little / and if it
stycke fast he is sound / and if it come lightly of: he is rotten. Also when
thou have kylde a sheep his belly will be full of water if he be sore rote^ /
and also the fat of the flesh will be yelowe if he be rotten. And also and
thou cut the liver / therein will be little quikens like flokes / and also the
liver will be full of knottes and white blysters if he be roten / and also
sethe the liver / if he be rotten it will break in pieces / and if he be sound
/ it will hold to gyder.

To bye lean catell.
THese husbands and they shall well thryue / they must have both kye / oxen /
horses / mares / and young catell / and to rere and bread every year some
calves and fools / or else shall he be a byet. And if thou shalt bye oxen for
the ploughe / se that they be young and not gowty / nor broken of here /
neither of tail / nor of pysell. And if thou by kyen to the payle / se that
they be young and good to milk / and feed her calves well. And if y^ bye kye
or oxen to feed / the younger they be? ye rather they will feed / but look well
that the here stare not / and that he lycke him self / and be hole mouthed /
and want no tethe. And though he have the gout and be broken both of tail
and pysell / yet will he feed. But ye gouty ox will not be driven far / and
se that he have a broad rybbe and a thycke hyde / and to be lose skynned y^ it
stycke not hard nor streyt to his rybbes / for than he will not feed.

To bye fat cattle.
ANd if thou shalt bye fat oxen or kye / ha^dell them / and se that they be
soft on the fore croppe / behynd the sholder / and upon the hyndermost rybbe /
and upon the hucklebone / and the nache by the tail And se the ox have a
great codde / and the cow great nauyll / for than it should seem that they
should be well talowed. And take heed where thou byest any lean cattle or
fat / and of whom / and where it was bred. For if thou bye out of a better
ground than thou have thy self / that catell will not like with the. And also
look that there be no manner of sekenes among the cattle in that towneshyp or
pasture that thou byest thy cattle out of. For if there be any murren or long
sought it is great Jeopardy / for a best may take sekenes ten or twelve days
or more or it appear on hyn.

Diverse sekenes of catell / and remedies therefore / and first of murren.
ANd if it fortune to fall murreyn among thy beestes / as god forbid / there
ben enough can help them. And it comes of a ranknes of blood / and apereth
most comynly first in the head / for his head will swell / and his eyes wax
great / and run of water and frothe at the mouth / and than he is past reme
die / and will dye shortly / and wyil never eat after he be sick. Than fley
him and make a deep pyt fast by there as he dies and cast him in / and cover
him with earth that no dogs may come to the caryen. For as many bestes as
feleth the smell of that caryen are lykely to be enfect / and take the skin /
and have it to the tanners to sell / and bring it not home for peril that may
fall. And it is commonly used and comes of a great charity / to take the bare
head of the same best and put it upon a long pole and set in a hedge fast
bound to a stake by y^ hye way side / that every man that rydeth or goes that
way / may se and know by that sign that there is syknes of cattle in the
townshyppe. And the husbands hold on opinion / that it shall the rather
cease. And when the beeste is flayne there as the murren does appear between
the flesh and the skin / it will rise up like a ielly / and froth an ynche
deep or more. And this is the remedy for the murren, Take a small curteyn cord
and bind it hard about the bestes neck / and that will cause the blood to
com into the neck / and on either side of the neck there is a vayn that a man
may feel with his finger / and than take a blood yren / and set it straight
upon the vain / and smite him blood on both sides / and let him blede the
mountenau^ce of a pynte or nyghe it / and than take away the cord and it will
stau^che bledynge. And thus serve all thy cattle that be in that close or
pasture / and there shall no mo be seek by gods leave.

Long sought / and remedy therefore.
THere is an other manner of sykenes among beestes is called long sought / and
that syckenes will endure long / and ye shall perceive it by his hoystynge /
he will stand much and eat but a little and wax very holowe and thyn. And he
will hoyste twenty times in an hour / and but few of them do mende. The best
remedy is to keep thy cattle in sondrye places / and as many as were in
company with that best that first fell seek / to let them a little blood. And
there be many men that can sever them / and that is to cut the dewlappe
before / and there is a grass that is called fetter grass / and take that
grass and bryse it a little in a mortar / and put thereof as much as an hens
egg in to the said dewlappe / and se it fall not out. Thus I have seen used
/ and men has thought it has done good.

Dewbolue / and the hard remedy therefore.
ANother disease among bestes is called dewbolue / and that comes when a
hungry beeste is put in a good pasture full of rank grass / he will ete so
much that his sides will stand as hye as his back bone / and otherwhyle the
one side more than the other / and but few of them will dye / but he may not
be driven hastly nor labored being so swollen / and the substance of it is
but wind / and therefore he would be softely driven and not sit down. How be
it I have seen a man take a knyfe and thrust him thrughe the skin and the
flesh two inches deep or more / six inches or more from the rydge bone /
that the wind may come out. For the wind lies between y^ flesh and the
great paunche.

Risen upon / and the remedy therefore.
ANother disease is called risen upon / and no man can tell how nor whereof it
comes / but ye shall perceive that by swellynge in the head / and specially by
the eyes / for they will ron on water and close his sight and will dye shortly
within an hour or two / if he be not helped / this is y^ cause of his disease.
There is a blyster risen under the tongue / y^ which blyster must be slytte with
a knyfe a cross. wha^ ye have pulled out ye tongue rub the blyster well with
salt / and take an he^nes egg / and break it in the bestes mouth shell and
all / and cast salt to it / and hold up the bestes head / that all may be
swalowed down into the body. But the brekynge of the blyster is the great
help / and drive the beast a little about / and this shall save him by the
help of Jesu.

The turn / and remedy therefore.
THere be beestes that will turn about when they at their mete / and will not
feed / and is great ieopardy for falling in pyttes / dyches / or waters / and
it is because that there is a bladder in the forhede / between the brayn pan
and the brains the which must be taken out / or else he shall never mende /
but dye as length / and this is the remedy and the gretest cure that can be on
a be. Take that best and cast him down and bind his four fete to gyder /
and with thy thombe thrust the best in the forhed / and where thou fyndest the
softest place / there take a knyfe and cut the skyn three or four inches on
both sides between y^ horns / and as much beneth toward the nose / and fley
it and turn it up / and pyn it fast with a pynne / and with a knyfe cut the
brain pan two inches broad and three inches long / but se the knyfe go no
deper than the thycknes of the bone for perysshynge of the brain / and take
away the bone / and than thou shall se a bladder full of water two inches long
and more / take that out and hurt not the brayn and than let down the skyn /
and sow it fast there as it was before / and bind a cloth two or three fold
upon his forehede to keep it from cold and wete. ten or. xii. days. And thus
have I seen many mended. But if the best be falte and any reasonable mete upon
him it is best to kill him / for than there is but little loss / and if the
bladder be under the horn / it is past cure. A sheep will have the turn as
well as a best / but I have seen none mended. etc.

The warrybrede / and the remedy therefore.
THere be beestes that will have warry bredes in diverse parties of their body
and legs / and this is the remedy. Cast him down and bind his four fete
to gydre / and take a culture or a pair of tongues or such an other yren / and
make it glowyng hot / and if it be a long warrybrede: sere it hard of by the
body / and if it be in the beginning / and be but flat / than lay the hot
iron upon it and sere it to the bare skin / and it will be hole for ever / be
it horse or best.

The foul / and the remedy therefore.
THere be bestes that will have the foul / and that is between the cleese /
sometime before / and sometime behind / and it will swell and cause him to
halte / and this is the remedy. Cast him down and bind his four fete to gyder
/ and take a rope of hear / or a hey rope / hard wrythen to gyder / and put
it between his clese / and draw the roope to and fro a good season / till he
blede well / and than lay to it soft made terre / and bind a clothe about it
/ that no mire nor gravel come between the clese / and put him in a pasture /
or to stand still in the house / and he will be shortly hole.

The gout without remedy.
THere be beestes that will have the gout / and most comynly in the hinder fete
/ and will cause him to halte and go starkely. And I never knew man that
could help it or find remedy therefore / but all only to put him in good
grass and feed him.

To rere calves.
IT is conuenyent for a husband to rere calves* and specially they that come
between Candelmasse and May / for that season he may spare milk best / and by
that time the calfe shall be wayned there will be grass enough to put him
unto. And at winter he will be bygge enough to save him self among other
beestes / with a little favor. And the da^me of the calfe shall bull again
and bring an other by the same time of the year / and if thou shall tarry till
after May / the calfe would be weyke in winter / and the da^me would not bull
again but often time go bareyne. And if thou shalt rere a calfe that comes
after Myghelmas / it will be costly to keep the calfe all the winter season at
hey / and the da^me at hard mete in the house / as they use in the plain
champyon contreys. And a cow shall give more milk with a little grass and
straw lyenge without in a close / than she shall do with hey and straw lyenge
in a house / for the hard meat dries up the milk. But he yt has no pasture
must do as he may / but yet is it better to the husband to sell those calves
than to rere them because of the cost / and also for the profit of the milk
to his house / and the rather the cow will take the bull. If the husband goo
with an ox plough / it is conuenyent that he rere two ox calves / and two cow
calves at the lest to uphold his stock / and if he may do mo? it will be more
profit. And it is better to wayne thy calves at gras than at hard mete / if
they went to grass before. And that man that may have a pasture for his kyen
and an other for his calves / and water in them both / than may he rere and
bread good bestes with light cost. And if thou wayne thy calves with hey / it
will make them have great belyes / and the rather they will rotte when they
come to grass / and in winter they would be put in a house by them self and
given hey on the nyghtes / and put in a good pasture on the day / and they
shall be much better to handell when they shall be kye or oxen.

To gelde calves.
IT is time to gelde his ox calves in the old of the moon / when they be ten
days or. xx. days olde*for than it is lest ieopardy / and the ox shall be
the more hyer and the longer of body / and the longer horned / and that may be
well proved to take two ox calves both of one kind / one making / and both
of one age / gelde one of them / and let the other go forth and be a bull. And
put them both in one pasture till they be four or five year old / and than
shall ye se the ox caife far greater every way than the bull / there is no
cause but the geldynge / and if thou geld them not till they be a year old /
there is more ieopardy / he shall be less of body / and shorter horned.

Horses and mares to draw.
A Husband may not be without horses and mares or both / and specially if he go
with a horse plough / he must have both his horses to draw / and his mares to
bring coltes to uphold his stock / and yet at many times they may draw well
/ if they be well handled. But they may not bear sackes / nor be rydden upon
no iourneys when they be with fool / and specially wha^ they have gone with
fool. xx. or. xxiii. wekes / for than is the greatest ieopardy. For and she be
rydden upon and set up hot / or turned out and take cold / she will cast her
fool / the which would be a great loss to the husband. For she will labor
and bear when she has fooled / and draw when she is with fool as well as the
horse. It is convenient for the husband to know when his mare would be horsed.
It is the common saying / that she will take the horse within ix. or x. days
next after that she has fooled but that saying I hold not with for and she
so do / she will not hold thereto / for the horse does drive her to it But. xx.
days after is tymely enough to bring her to a horse / for she will not hold to
it / except she be kene of horsyng and that shall ye know by her shap / for
that will twyrl^o^en and close again many times in an hour / and than bring
her to a horse and let her be with him a day or a night / and that is
suffycyent. For it is better to keep the horse from the mares / than to go with
them for diverse causes / and specially he shall be more lusty / and the moo
horse coltes shall he get. But he that has very many mares may not always
attend them / but let them go together and take as god sendes it Some men hold
an opinion / y^ put a horse to a mare in the beginning of the moon after it be
pryme / and he shall get a horse fool. And some men say the contrary that and
he be put to the mare in the old of the moon he should gere horse fools. And I
say it makes no matter whether / for this cause I have proved. I have my self
lx. mares and more / able to bear the horse / and from May day unto saint
Barthy^mewes day / I have. v. or. vi. horses going with them both day and
night / and at the folynge time I have upon one day a horse fool / and on the
next day or second a mare fool / and on the third or fourth day next after
a horse fool again / and so every weke of both sorts / and by their opinion or
reason I should have.xiiii. days together horse foles / and other.xiiii. days
together mare foles. And me seems that those men that hold y^ opinion speak
sophistically / that if so be they laid any wagers there upon / that they should
both win in their own conceyte by this reason. whether it were get in the
new of the moon or in the old of the moon / it is a horse fool because a horse
gate it / though it be a fely fool and it is a mares fool because a mare foled
it / though it be a horse colte, And so (diuersis respectibus) their opynyo^s
may be true. But of one thing I am certain* that some one horse will get more
horse fools than some other horse will do / and likewise a mare will bear mo
mare foles / than some other mare will do / though they be horsed both with one
horse. Me seems there is no reason why / but y^ lustynes of y^ nature of both
parties whether of them shall have the dominacyon. But and ye have mares of
diverse colors* tha^ do as I do / sever them in diverse parcels / and put to
your white mares a gray horse / or a white horse that has no white rathe in y^
forhede / and to your graye mares a white horse / so that he be not al white
skynned about the mouth. And to your mares of color that have no white upon
them a colored horse that has much white on him / and to your colored
mares of main white a horse of color of main white. And thus shall ye have
well colored coltes / it makes no matter of what color the horse be of / so
he be neither white nor gray. For and ye put a white horse to a colored mare /
she shall have most comynly a sandy colte like an yren gray / neither like
sire nor dame. How be it I have seen and known many mares that will have their
colte like the horse that gate it / the which is against kind of mares / for
a man may rather get one good horse than many good mares.

The losses of a lamb / a calfe / or a fool.
IT is less hurt to a man to have his cow to cast her calfe / than an ewe
to cast her lamb For the calfe will souke as much milk or it be able to
kill as it is worth / and of the ewe comes no profit of the milk but the
lamb. How be it they use in some places to milk their ewes when they have
wayned their lambs / but that is great hurt to the ewes / and will cause
them that they will not take the ram at the time of the year for pouertye /
but go ba^^yn. And if a mare cast her fool / that is thryse ^o great a loss
/ for if that fool becomen of good bread as it is necessary every man to
provide / for as much costs and charges has a badde mare as a good. In
short space the fool with good keeping may be sold for as much money as
would bye many calves and lambs.

what cattle should go together in one pasture.
BEest^ alone / nor horses alone / nor sheep alone except it be sheep upon a
very high ground / will not eat a pasture even / but leave many tuftes and
high grass in diverse places / except it be over laid with cattle. wherefore
know that horses and beestes will agree well in one pasture / for there is
some manner of grass that a horse will eat / and a be will not eat / as
the fitches / flasshes and low places / and all the holowe bunnes and pypes
that grow therein. But horses and sheep will not so well agree / except it be
sheep to feed / for a sheep will go on a bare pasture and will eat the swetest
grass / and so will a horse / but he would have it longer. How be it he will
eat as nygh y^ earth as a sheep / but he can not so soon fill his belly. To an
hundred beestes ye may put. xx horses / if it be low ground / and if there
be grass enough put in a hundred sheep / and so after the rate be y^ pasture
more or less. And after this manner they may feed and eat the close even and
leave but few tuftes. And if it be an high ground / put in moo sheep and less
beestes and horses Mel che kye and draught oxen will eat a close much barer
tha^ as many fat kye and oxen. And a melche cow may have to much meet / for
and she wax fat she will the rather take the bull / and give less milk /
for the fatnes stops the pores and the veins that should bring the milk
to the pappes. And therefore mean grass is best to keep her in a mean estate
And if a cow be fat when she shall calue / than is there great ieopardy in
her / and the calfe shall be the less / but ye can not give your draught ox
to much mete / except it be the aftermath of a late mowen medowe / for that
will cause him to have the gyrre / and than he may not well labor / And there
be to much gras in a close* the cattle shall feed the worse / for a good
bytte to the earth is suffycyent / for and it be long / the beeste will byte of
the top and no more / for that is swetest / and the other lies still upon
the ground and rotteth / and no beast will eat it but horse in winter / but
these bestes / horses / and sheep may not be fodered to gyder in winter / for
than they would be severed / for else the bestes with their horns will put
both the horses and the sheep / and gore them in their bellyes. And it is
necessary to make standing cratches to cast their fodder in / and the staves
set nyghe enough to gyder for pulling their fodder to hastily ^^t for
shedynge. And if it be laid upon the e^th / the fourth part thereof will be
lost. And if ye lay it upon the earth / lay it every time in a new place /
for the old will mar the new.

It might fortune I could shows as many defautes of horses as here be good
propertyes / but than I should break my promise that I ma^e at Grombalde bridge
the first time that I went to Ryppon to bye coltes. But it is to suppose that
if a horse want any of these good propertyes / that he should have a defaut in
the same place. And that is sufficient for this time.

and his hands to handell. It is a saying / that such a horse should dye
suddenly when he has lived as many years as the moon was days old at such
time as he was soied.

The saying of the frenshe man.
These be sorance / hurtes / and dyseases that now become to my mind / and
the frenshe man says. Mort ^^ ^angue et de eschyne / sount ma^adyes saunce
medecin. The mournyng of the tongue and of the chyne / are diseases without
remedy or medicine / And farther he says. Gatdes bien que il soyt cler de
view* que tout trauayl ne soit perdue. Be well ware that he be clear of syghte
/ lest all thy travail or journey be lost ere night. And because I am a horse
master my self? I have showed you the sorance and dyseases of horses / to the
intent that men should beware and take good head what horses they bye of me or
of any other, How be it I say to my customers and those that bye any horses of
me / and ever they will trust any horse master or corser while they live? trust
me,

The diuersyte between a horse master* a torser / and a horse leche.
A Horse master is he that byeth wild horses / or coltes / or bredeth them
and sells them again wild / or breaks part of them and makes them tame
/ and than sells them. A corser is he yt byeth all rydden horses and sells
them again. The horse leche is he that takes upon him to cure and mende all
manner of dyseases and sorance that horses have. And wha^ these three be met /
if ye had a poticary to make the fourth / ye might have such four / that it
were hard to trust y^ bent of them. It were also co^uenyent to show medicynes
and re^^iedyes for all these diseases and sorances / but it would be to long a
process at this time / for it would be as much as half this book. And I
have not the perfyte conyng nor ye experyence to show medicynes and remedies
for them all. And also the horse leche would not be content therewith / for it
might fortune to hur^e or hinder their occupacyo^.

Of swyne.
NOw thou husband that have both horses and mares / beestes / and sheep. It
were necessary also that thou have both swyne and bees / for it is an old
saying / he that has both sheep / swyne and bees / sleep he wake he / he may
thryue. And that saying is because that they be those things that most
profit ryseth in shortest space with y^ leest cost. Than se how many swyne
thou art able to keep / let them be bores and sowes all / and no hogs. And
if thou be able to rere vi. pigs a year / than let two of them be bores / and
four of them sowes / and so to co^tynue after y^ rate. For a bore will have as
little keeping as a hog / and is much better than a hog / and more meet on
him and is ready at all times to eat in the winter season / and to be laid in
sowse. And a sow or she be able to kill shall bring forth as many pigs or
moo as she is worth / and her body is never the worse / and will be as good
baken as a hog and as little keeping / but at such time as she has pigs.
And if thy sow have moo pigs than thou will rere / sell them or eat them /
and rere those pigs that come about lenten time / specially the beginning of
somer / for they can not be rered in winter for cold without great cost.

Of bees.
OF bees is little charge / but good attendau^ce at the time that they shall
cast the swarm. It is ^^^enyent that the hyue be set in a garden or an
orchyarde / where as they may be kept from the north wind / and the mouth of
the hyue toward the son And in June and July they do most comynly cast /
and they would have some low trees nygh unto them before the hyue / that the
swarm may light upon / and wha^ the swarm is knytte / take a hyue and splent
it within with three or four splentes / that the bees may knytte their combs
unto / and anoint the splentes and the sides of the hyue with a little honny.
And if thou have no honny take sweet cream / and tha^ set a stole or a form
nygh unto the swarm / and lay a clean wasshen she^e upon the stole / and than
hold the small end of the hyue downwarde / and shake the bees in to the hyue
and wort^y set it upon the stole and turn up the corers of the shete over the
hyue / and to leave one place open that the bees may come in and out / but thou
may not fight nor strive with them for no cause / and to lay nyttyls upon
the bows where as they were knytte / to drive them fro that place / and so
watch them all that day that they go not away / and at night when all be
gone up in to the hyue / take it away and set it where it shall frande / and
take away thy shete / and have clay ready tempered to lay it about upon the
board or stone where it shall stand / that no wind come in / but the board is
better and warmer. And to ^^aue an hole open on the south side of three inches
broad / and an inche of heyght for the bees to come in and out And than to make
a covering of whete straw or ^ye straw to cover and house the hyue about /
and set the hyue two foot or more from the earth upon stakes / so that a
mouscanne not come to it / and also neither beestes nor swyne. And if a swarm
be cast late in y^ year / they would be fed with honny in winter / and laid
upon a thynne narow board / or a thynne s^la^e or leed and put it in to the
houe / and another thynne board would be set before every hyues mouth that no
wyndecome in / and to have four or five little nyckes made on the neither side /
that a be may come out or go in / and so fastened that yt wind blow it not
down and to take it up when he will. And that hyue that is fed / to stop
the mouth clean that other bees come not in / for and they do / they will
fight and kill each other. And beware that no waspes come in to the hyue / for
they will kill the bees / and eat the honny. And also there is a be is called
a drone / and she is greater than an other be / and they will eat the honny
and gader nothing / and therefore they would be kylde / and it is a saying
that she has lost her stynge and than she will not labor as the other do.

How to keep beestes and other cattle.
IF a hushande shall keep cattle well to his profit / he must have several
closes and pastures to put his cattle in / the which would be well quycke
setted / dyched / and hedged that he may sever his byggest cattle from the
weykest at his pleasure / and specially in winter time when they shall be
fodered. And though a man be but a farmer / and shall have his farm. xx. years
/ it is less cost for him / and more profit to quyckset dyche and hedge /
than to have his cattle go before the herdman. For let / ye husband spend in
three years as much money as the keeping of his beestes swyne and sheep does
cost him in three years. Than always after he shall have all manner of cattle
with the tenth part of the cost / and the beestes shall like much better. And
by this reason the herdman will have for every be. ii. d. a quarter / or
there about. And ye swyneherde will have for every swyne a penny at the leest.
Than he must have a shepeherde of his own / or else he shall never thryue. Tha^
reken meet / drink and wages for his shepeherde / the herdmannes hyre and the
swyneherdes hyre / these charges will double his rent or nygh it / except his
farm be above xl. s. by year. Now se what his charges be in. iii. years let
him ware as much money in quycksettynge / dy^ thing and hedgynge / and in
three years he shall be dyscharged for ever more / and much of this labor he and
his servants may do with their own hands / and save much money. And than
has he every field in seueralty / and by the assentes of the lords and the
tenau^tes every neighbor may exchange lands with other. And than shall his
farm be twyse so good in profit to the tenant as it was before / and as
much land kept intyllage / and than shall not the rich man over eat the poor
man with his cattle / and the fourth part of hey and straw shall serve his
cattle better in a pasture than four times so much will do in a house and
less attendaunce / and better the catell shall like / and the chief sauegarde
for corn both day and night that can be.

To get settes and set them.
ANd if thou have pastures? y^ must needs have quyk setting / dychynge / and
plasshynge / when it is grene and comes of age. Than get thy quycksettes in
the wode country / and let them be of white thorn and crabtre / for they be
best / holy and hasell be good. And if thou dwell in the plain country / than
may thou get both asshe / oak and elm / for they will encreas much wode in
short space And set thy oak settes and thy a^she. x. or. xii. foot asonder /
and cut them as thou do thy other settes / and cover them over with thorns a
little that sheep and cattle eat them not. And also wede them clean in
mydsomer moan / or soon after / for the wedes if they over grow will kill the
settes. But get no black thorn for nothing / for that will grow outward into
the pasture and does much hurt in the gras and tearing the wolle of the
sheep. It is good time to set quycksettes fro that time the leaves be fallen:
unto our Lady day in lent / and thy sandy ground or grauel? set first / than
clay ground / and than mean ground / and the meadow or marreys ground last /
for the sand and gravel will dry anon / and than the quyckset will take no
rote / except it have great wete / for the mouldes will lie lose / if it be
dyched in February or March / and like wise clay ground. And make thy settes
long enough that they may be set deep enough in the earth / for than they will
grow the better. And to stand half a foot and more above the earth / that they
may spryng out of many branches And than to take a line and set it there as
thou wylt have thy hedge / and to make a trenche after thy line and to pare
away the grass where the quycksettes shall be set / and cast it by where the
earth of the dyche shall lie / and dygge up the mouldes a spade graffe deep /
and to put in thy settes / and dygge up more molde and lay upon that set / and
so peruse till thou have set all thy settes / and let them lene toward the
dyche. And a foot from that make thy dyche / for and thou make it to nere thy
settes / the water may fortune to were the ground on that side / and cause thy
settes to fall.

To make a dyche.
If thou make thy dyche. iiij. foot broad / than would it be two foot and a
half deep. And if it be. v. foot broad than three foot deep / and so according
/ And if it be v. foot broad / han it would be double set / and the rather it
would fence it self / and the lower hedge will serve.

To make a hedge.
THou must get the stakes of the heart of oak / for those be best / crabtre /
black thorn / and eldre be good. Read wethy is best in marsshe ground / as^he
/ maple / hasell / and white thorn will serve for a time? And set thy stake
within two foot and a half to gydre / except thou have very good edderynge
and long to bind with. And if it be double eddered? it is much the better /
and great strength to the hedge / and much le^ger it will last. And say thy
small trouse or thorns that thou hedges with all over thy quycksettes / that
sheep do not eat thy spryng nor buddes of thy settes. Let thy stakes be well
driven that the point take the hard earth. And when thou have made thy hedge
and eddered it well / than take thy mall again and drive down thy edderynges
and also thy stakes by and by. For with the wyndynge of the edderynges: thou
do lose thy stakes / and therefore they must needs be driven new and hardened
again / and the better the stake will be driven when he is well bound.

To plasshe or pleche a hedge.
IF the hedge be of. x. or. xii. years growing sithe it was first set / than
take a sharp hatchet or a handbyll and cut the settes in a plain place nygh
unto the earth the more half a sonder / and bend it down toward the earth
and wrappe and wind them together / but always se that the top lie hyer than
the rote a good qua^tyte / for else the sap will not run into the top
kyndely* but by process the top will dye / and than set a little hedge on the
back side / and it shall need no more mendyng many years after / And if the
hedge be of. xx. xxiiij. or. xxx. years of age sithe it was first set / than
wind in first all y^ nethermost bows and wind them to gydre / and than cut
the settes in a plain place a little from the earth the more half a sonder /
and to let it slave downwarde and not upward for diverse causes / than wind the
bows and braun ches thereof into the hedge / and at every two foot or three
foot to leave one growing not plached / and the top to be cut of four foot
high or there about to stand as a stake if there be any such / or else to
set another / and to wind the other that be pleched about them. And if the
bows will not lie plain in the hedge / than cut it the more half asonder and
bind it in to the hedge / and than shall ye not need for to mende that hedge
but in few places twenty years after or more. And if the hedge be old and be
great stubbes or trees / and thyn in the bottom that beestes may go under or
between the trees / than take a sharp axe and cut the trees or stubbes that
grow a foot from the earth or there about in a plain place within an ynch or
two inches of the side / and let them slave downwarde as I said before / and
let the top of one tree lie over the rote of an other tree / and to pleche
down the bows of the same tree / to stop the holow places. And if all the
holowe and void places will not be filled and stopped / than scour the old
dyche and cast it up new / and to fill with earth all the void places. And if
so be these trees will not reche in every place to make a suffycyente defense /
than double quykset it and dyche it new in every place that is needful and
set a hedge thereupon / and to ouerlay the settes for eating of sheep or other
cattle.

To mende a hye way.
ME seems it is necessary to show mine opinion how an hye way should be
amended. And first and pryncypally se that there be no water standing in the
hye way / but that it be always current and rennynge / nor have non abydyng
more in one place tha^ in an other. And in somer wha^ the water is dried up
than to get gravel and do fill up every low place / and to make them even /
somwat dyscendynge or current one way or other / and if there be no grauel nor
stones to get / yet fill it up with earth in the beginning of somer / that it
may be well hardened with caryage and treadyng upon / and it shall be well
amended if the water may pass away from it / the which would be well
considered / and specially about London / where as they make much more cost
tha^ needs / for there they dyche their hye ways on both sides / and fill up
the holowe and low places with earth / and than they cast and lay gravel
aloft. And when a great rain or water comes and synketh through the grauel and
comes to the earth? than the earth swells and bolneth and waxes soft / and
with treading / and specially with caryage the gravel synketh and goth
downwarde as his nature and kind requires / and than it is in manner of a
quycke sand / that hard it is for any thing to go over. But and they would
make no dyche in somertyme wha^ the water is dried up that a man may se all the
holowe and low places / than to carry gravel and fill it up as high as y^
other knolles be / than would it not bolne ne swel nor be no quycke sand / and
every man may go beside y^ hye way with their caryage at their pleasure. And
this me seems is less cost / and le^ger will last with a little mendynge when
need requires. Therefore me thinks if this were well looked upon / it should
be both good and necessary for that purpose / for so have I seen done in other
places where as I have been. etc.

To remove and set trees.
IF thou will remove and set trees / get as many rotes with them as thou can
/ and break them not nor bryse them by thy will. And if there be any rote
broken and sore bruised / cut it of hard by there as it is bruised with a sharp
hatchet / else that rote will dye. And if it be ash / elm or oak / cut of al
y^ bows clean and save the top hole. For if thou make him rich of bows /
thou make him* poor of thryfte for two causes. The bows causes them to
shake with wynd and to lose the rotes. Also he can not be so clean get / but
some of the rotes must needs be cut / and than there will not come so much
sap and moystnes to the bows as there did before / and if if y^ tree be very
long / cut of the top two or three yerdes. And if it be an aple tree or peer
tree or such other as bears fruit / than cut away all y^ water bows and y^
small bows that y^ princypall bows may have y^ more ^ap. And if ye make a
mark which side of ye tree stands toward y^ son that he may be ^et so
again / it is so much the better.

Trees to be set without rotes and grow.
THere be trees will be set without roots and grow well and spring rotes of
them self. And those be diverse apple trees that have ^n^tres in the bows / as
casses or wydes / and such other that will grow on slauynges / and likewise
pepeler and wethy / and they must be cut clean beside the tree that they grow
on / and the top cut clean of. viii. or. x. foot of length and all the bows
between / and to be set a foot deep or more in the earth in good ground. And ye
shall understand that there be four manner of wethyes / that is to say / white
wethy / black whethy / reed wethy / and osyerde wethy. white wethy will grow
upon dry ground / if it be set in the beginyng of winter / and will not grow
in marsshe ground / black wethy will grow better on marsshe ground than on
dry ground / and read wethy in like manner / and osyerde wethy will grow best
in water and moist ground. And they be trees that will sone be nourys^hed /
and they will bear much wode / and they would be cropped every. vii. or. viii.
years or else they will dye / but they may not be cropped in sap time / nor no
tree else. And in many places both y^ lords freholders and tenau^tes at will set
such wethyes and pepelers in marshe ground to nourys^he wode.

To fell wode for household / or to sell.
IF thou have any wodes to fell for thy household to bren or to sell / than fell
the under wode first in winter / that thy catell or bestes may eat and brouse
the tops / and to fell no more on a day but as much as the bestes will eat
the same day / or on the morrow after. And as soon as it is well eaten or
broused / tha^ kydde it and set them on the ends / and that will save the
bands from rottynge / and they shall be the lyghter to carry / and the better
will they brenne and lie in less rowme. And when thou shalt bring them home
to make a stake of them / set the nether most course upon the ends / and the
second course flat upon the lyde and the ends upward / and the third
course flat on the side overthwart the other. And so to peruse the^ till thou
have laid all up. And when thou shall bre^ne them? take the ouermost first.

To shrede / loppe / or croppe trees.
IF y^ have any trees to shrede / loppe / or croppe / for the fire wode /
croppe them in winter / that thy beestes may eat the brouse and the moss of
the bows / and also the yues. And when they be broused and eaten / dress the
wode and bow it clean / and cut it at every byght / and rere the great wode to
the tree / and kydde the small bows and set them on end. And if thou shall not
have sufficyent wode except thou head thy trees and cut of the tops / than
head them three or four foot above any tymbre / and if it be no tymbre tree but
a shaken tree or a hedge rote full of knottes / than head him thyrty foot high
/ or twenty at the least / for so far he will bear plenty of wode and bows /
and much more than and he were not headed. For a tree has a propertye to grow
to a certain heyghte / and when he comes to that heyght he stands still /
and grows no hyer but in bread / and in conclusyon the top will dye and
decrese / and the body thryue.

And if a tree be heded and used to be lopped and cropped at every. xii. or.
xvi. years end or there about / it will bear much more wode by process of
time than and it were not cropped / and much more profit to the owner.

How a man should shrede / loppe / or croppe trees.
IT is the common use to begin at the top of ye tree when he shall be shred
or cropped / because each bow should lie upon other when they shall fall / so
that the weyghte of the bows shall cause them to be the rather cut down. But
that is not best / for that causes the bows to slave down the neither part
/ and pulls away the bark from the body of the tree the which will cause
the tree to be holowe in that place in time coming / and many times it shall
hyn der him. And therefore / let him begin at the nethermost bough first / and
with a light axe / for an hand to cut the bough on both sides a foot or two
foot from the body of the tree. And specially cut it more on the nether side
than on the over side / so that the boughe fall not streyghte down but turn
on the side / and than shall it not slave nor break no bark. And every boughe
will have a new head / and bear much more wode / and by thy will without
thou must needs do it / croppe not thy tree / nor specially head him when the
wind stands in the north / nor in the eest. And beware that thou croppe him
not nor head him (specially) in sap time / for than will he dye within a few
years after / if it be an oak.

To sell wode or tymbre.
IF thou have any wode to sell / I advise the retayle it thy self / if thou
may attend upon it / and if not / than to cause thy bailey or some other wise
or dyscret man to do it for the. And if it be small wod to kydde it and sell it
by the hondredes or by the thousands / and if there be ashes in it / to sell
the small ashes to cowpers for garches / and the great ashes to whele
wryghtes / and the mean ashes to plough wryghtes / and the crabbe trees to
myllers to make cogges and ronges. And if there be any oaks both great and
small / fell them and pyll them / and sell the bark by it self / and than
sort the trees / the polles by them self / ye myddell sort by them self / and
the greatest by the^ self / and than sell them by scores or half scores or
hondredes / as thou may / and to fell it hard by ye earth / for one foot
next to the earth is worth two foot in the top / and to cut thy timber
long enough that thou leave no timber in the top. And to sell the tops as
they lie a great / or else dress them and sell the great wood by it self /
and the kydde wood by it self / and to fall the under wode first at any time
by twene Martylmasse and holy rode day. And all the ashes between Martylmasse
and Candelmasse / and all oaks as soon as they will pyll until may be done /
and not after. Perauenture the gretest man has not the best prouysyn. And that
is because y^ servants will not inform him these ways / and also may fortune
they would bye such wodes them self / or be partener of the same / and to
advise his lord to sell them. It is not co^uenyent that the salesman that
sells the wod to be partener with the byer.

To keep spring wode.
IN the winter before that thou will fell thy wod: make a good and a sure
hedge that no manner of cattle can get in. And as shortly as it is fallen? let
it be carried away or the spring come up / for else the catell that does carry ye
wode will eat ye spring / and when the top is eaten or broken it is a great
let / hurt / and hynderaunce / of the goodness of the spring / for than
where it is eaten / it burges out of many branches / and not so fair as the
first would have been. A park is best kept when there is neither man / dog /
nor four foted best therein / except dear. And so is a spring best kept where
there is neither man nor four foted bestes within the hedge / but and there be
much gras and thou were loathe to lose it / than put in calves newly wayned and
take from their da^mes and also waynyng coltes or horses not past a year of
age. And let thy calves be taken away at May / the coltes may go longer for
catynge of any wode / but there is ieopardy both for calves / foles and coltes
/ for tyckes / or for being lousye / y^ which will kill them if they be not
taken head unto. And seven year is the lest that it will save it self / but
ten year is best. And than the under bows would be cut away / and made kyddes
thereof / and the other will grow much the better and faster. And if the
under bows be not cut away / they will dye / and than they be lost / and
great hurt to the spring / for they take away the sap that should cause
the spring to grow better.

Necessary things belonging to graffynge.
IT is necessary / prosytable / and also a pleasure to a husband to have
peers / wardeynes / and apples of diverse sorts. And also cheryes / fylberdes
/ ^ulleys / dampsons / plummes / walnuttes / and such other. And therefore it
is co^uenyent to learn how thou shall graffe. Than it is to be known what
things thou must have to graffe withal. Thou must have a graffynge saw / the
which would be very thyn and thycke t^thed / and because it is thyn / it will
cut the narower kyrfe and the clener for brysynge the bark. And therefore it is
set in a compass pyece of yren / six inches fro? to make it styffe and bygge
/ thou must have also a graffynge knyfe an ynche broad with a chycke back to
cleue the stock withal. And also a mallet to drive thy knyfe and thy wedge in
to the tree / and a sharp knyfe to pare the stock head / and an other sharp
knyfe to cut the graffe clean. And also thou must have two wedges of hard
wode or else of yren / a long small one for a small stock / and a brother for a
bygger stock to open the stock / when it is cloven and pared / and also good
toughe clay and moss / and also bastes or pyllynge of wythy or elm to bind
them with.

what fruit should be first graffed.
PEtres and wardeyns would be graffed before any manner of aples / because the
sap comes loner and rather into the pere tree and wardeyn tree than in to
the apple tree. And after saint Ualentyns day? it is time to graffe both peers
and wardeynes till March be comen / and than to graffe apples to our lady day.
And than graffe that that is gote^ of an old apple tree first / for that will
budde before the graffe got of a young apple tree late graffed. And a pere or
a wardeyn would be graffed in a pyrre stock / and if thou can get none / than
graffe it in a crabtre stock / and it will do well / and some men graffe them
in a white thorn / and tha^ it will be the more harder and stony. And for all
manner of apples? the crabtre stock is best.

How to graffe.
THou must get thy graffes of the fairest lanses that thou canste find on the
tree / and se that it have a good knot or ioynte and an even. Than take thy
saw and saw in two thy crabtree in a fair plain place pare it even with thy
knyfe / and than cleue the stock with thy great knyfe and thy mallet / and
set in a wedge / and open the stock according to the thycknes of thy graffe
/ than take thy small sharp knyfe and cut the graffe on both sides in y^
joint / but pass not the mids thereof for no thing. And let the inner side
that shall be set in to the stock be a little thynner than the utter side /
and the nerer the nether point of the graffe the thynner / than proferre thy
graffe in to the stock / and if it go not close / than cut the graffe or y^
stock till they close clean / that thou can not put the edge of thy knyfe on
neither side between y^ stock and the graffe / and set them so that the tops
of the graffe bend a little outward / and se that the wode of the graffe be
set mete with the wode of the stock that the sap of the stock may run
straight and even with the sap of the graffe / for the bark of the graffe is
never so thycke as the bark of the stock.

And therefore thou may not set the barks mete on the utter side / but on the
ynner side / than pull away thy wedge / and it will stand much faster. Thanne
take tough clay like marley and lay it upon the stock ^eed and with thy
finger lay it close unto the graffe / and a little under the heed to keep it
moist / and that no wind come in to the stock at the cleuyng. Than take moss
and lay there upon for chynynge of the clay than take a baste of white wethy or
elm / or half a brere / and bind the moss / the clay / and the graffe
together / but be well ware that thou break not thy graffe neither in the
clayenge nor in the byndynge / and thou must set some thing by thy graffe that
crows nor birds do not light upon thy graffe / for and they do / they will
break them.

To graffe between the bark and the tree.
THere is an other manner of graffynge tha^ this and sooner done and sooner to
grow / but it is more ieopardy for wind when it begineth to grow Thou must
saw thy stock and pare the heed thereof / as thou dydest before / but cleue it
not / than take thy graffe and cut it in the joint to the mids / and make the
tenant thereof half an inche long or a little moreal on the one side / and
pare the bark away a little at the point on the other side / tha^ thou must
have made ready a ponche of hard wode with a stop and a tenant on the one
side like to the tenant of the graffe. Than put the tenant of the ponche
between the bark and the wode of the stock / and pull it out again and put
in the graffe / and se that it join close or else mende it. And this can not
fail / for n^w the sap comes on every side but it will spring so fast /
that yfit stand on plain ground / the wind is lykely to blow it beside the
heed / for it has no fastnes in the wode. And this is y^ best remedy for
blowynge of / to cut or clyppe away some of y^ nethermest leaves as they
grow. And this is the best way to graffe / and specially a great tree. than
clay it and bind it as thou dydest the other.

To nourysshe all manner of stone fruit and nuttes.
AS for cheryes / dampsons / bulleys / plummes / and such other may be set on
the stones / and also of the scyences growing about the tree of the same /
for they will sonest bear. Fylberdes and wall nuttes may be set on the nuttes
in a gardeyn / and after removed and set where he will. But when they be*re
removed / they would be set upon as good as a ground or a better / or else they
will not like.

A short informacyon for a young gentylman that entendeth to thryue.
IAduyse him to get a copy of this present book and to read it from the
beginning to the ending / whereby he may perceive the chapytres and contents
in the same / and by reason of often redynge he may wax perfyte what should be
done at all seasons. For I learned two verses at gra^mer scole / and those be
these. Gntta cauat lapide^ non vi / sed sepe cadendo: sic homo fit sapiens non
vi / sed sepe legendo. A drop of water perseth a stone / not all only by his
strenghe / but by his often falling. Right so a man shall be made wise / not
al only by him self / but by his often redyng. And so may this young gentylman
according to the season of the year / read to his servants what chapter he
will. And also for any other manner of profit contained in the same / the
which is necessary for a young husband that has not the experyence of
husbandry / nor other things contained in this present book / to take a good
remembrance and credence thereunto / for there is an old saying / but of what
auctoryte I ca^ not tell. Quod melior est practica rusticorum / quam scientia
philosophorum. It is better the practyue or knowledge of an husband man well
proved / than the science or conning of a philosopher not proved / for there
is nothing touching husbandry and other profytes contained in this present
book / but I have had the experyence thereof / and proved the same. And over
and beside all this book / I will advise him to rise betyme in the morning /
according to the verse before of. s. Sanat sanctificat et dicat surgere mane.
And to go abbute his closes / pastures / feeldes / and specially by the hedges
/ and to have in his purse a pair of tables / and when he sees any thing
that would be amended / to write it in his tables / as and he find any horses
/ mares / beestes / sheep / swyne / or geese in his pastures that be not his
own. And perauenture though they be his own / he would not have them to go
there / or to find a gap or a sherde in his hedge / or any water standing in
his pastures upon his grass whereby he may take double hurt / both loss of
his grass and rottynge of his sheep and calves. And also of standing water in
his corn feeldes at the lands ends or sides / and how he would have his
lands plowed / do^ged / sturred / or sown. And his corn weded or shorn / or
his cattle shyfted out of one pasture i^ to an other / and to look what
dychynge / quycksettynge or plasshyng is necessary to be had / and to over se
his shepeherde / how he handles and ordreth his sheep / and his servants how
they plowe and do their warkes / or if any gate be broken down or want any
staves / and go not lightly to open and tyne / and that it do not trayle / and
that the wyndes blow it not open / with many moo necessary things y^ are to
be looked upon. For a man always wandrng or going about somewhat fyndeth or sees
that is amysse and would be amended. And as soon as he sees any such defautes
/ tha^ let him take out his tables and write the defautes. And when he comes
home to dinner / souper / or at night / than let him call his bailey or his head
seruante / and to show him the defautes / that they may be shortly amended And
when it is amended than let him put it out of his tables. For this used I to
do. x. or. xii. years / and more / and thus let him use daily / and in short
space he shall set much thing in good order / but daily it will have
mendynge. And if he can not write? let him nycke the defautes upon a stycke
and to show his bailey as I said before: Also take heed both erly and late: at
all times what manner people resort and come to thy house / and the cause of
their coming / and specially if they bring with them pytchers / cannes
tanckardes / bottels / bags / wallettes / or busshell pokes / for if thy
servants be not true / they may do the great hurt / and them self little
advantage / wherefore they would be well looked upon And he that has two true
servants / a man servant: and an other a woman servant / he has a great
treasure / for a true servant will do justly him self / and if he se his
fellows do amysse / he will bydde them do no more so / for and they do / he
will show his master thereof / and if he do not this / he is not a true
servant. etc.

A lesson made in Englyssh verses to teache a gentyl man's servant to say at
every time when he takes his horse for his remembrance / that he shall not
forget his gere in his ynne behind him.
PUrse / dagger / cloak / night cap / kerchef / shoyng horn / boget / and
shoes. Spear / male / hode / halter / saddle clothe / sporres / hat / horse
comb / bow / arowes / sword / buckler / horn / leysshe / gloves / thy stryng
/ and thy bracer. Pen / paper / ynke / parchme^t / redwaxe / po^mes / books /
thou remember. Penknyfe / comb / thymble / nedle / threde / point / lest y^
thy gurth break. Bodkyn / knyfe / lyngell / give thy horse mete / se he be
shoed well. Make merry / sing and thou can / take heed to thy gere that thou
lose none.

A prologue for the wives occupacyon.
NOw thou husband / y^ have done thy dylygence^ and labor that longs to an
husband to get thy living / thy wives / thy children and thy servants yet is
there other things to be done that needs must be done / or else y^ shall not
thryue. For there is an old common saying / that seldom does the husband
thryue without y^ leave of his wife. By this saying it should seem y^ there be
other occupacyons and labors y^ be most co^uenyent for y^ wives to do. And how
be it y^ I have not the experyence of all their occupacyons and warkes as I
have of husba^dry. Yet a little will I speak what they ought to do / though I
tell them not how they should do and exceryse their labors and occupacyons.

A lesson for the wife.
BUt yet or I begin to show y^ wife what works she shall do: I will first
teache her a lesson of Salamon / as I did to her husband a lesson of y^
philosopher / and that is y^ she should not be idle at no time / for Salamon
says. Oc^osus gaudedit cum electis in celo: sed lugebit ineternu^ cum
reprobis in inferno. That is to say / that idle folk shall not toye with y^
chosen folks in heaven / but they shall sorrow with the reproved and forsaken
folks in hell. And saint ^herom says. Semper boni operis aliquid facito vt te
diabolus inueniat occupatu^: quia sicut in aqua stante genera^t^ vermes: sic in
homine ocioso generantur male cogitationes. That is to say / always be doing of
some good warkes / that y^ devil may find the always occupied for as in a
standing water are engendered worms / right so in an idle body are engendered
idle thoughts. Here may thou se that of ydelnes comes dampnaryon / and of
good warkes and labor comes salvation Now art thou at thy lybertye to chose
whether way thou wylt / wherein is a great dyuersyte. And he is an unhappy man
or woman that god has given both wit and reason and puts him in chose /
and he to chose y^ worste part. Now thou wife / I trust to show to the diverse
occupacyons / warkes and labors that thou shalt not need to be idle no time
of the year. etc.

what things the wife is bounden of right to do.
HIrst and pricypally the wife is bound of right to love her husband above
father and mother and all other men. For our lord says in his gospel.
Relinquet patrem et matrem et adherebit vxori sue. A man should leave father and
mother and draw to his wife / and the same wise a wife do to her husband. And
are made by the virtue of the sacrament of holy xeriture one flesh / one
blood / one body / and two souls wherefore their hearts / their minds / their
warkes and occupacyons should be al one / never to sever nor change during
their natural lives by any man's act or deed / as it is said in the same
gospel. Quod deus coniunxit / homo non separet. That thing that god has
joined togydre? no man may seruer nor depart. Wherefore it is conuenyent that
they love each other as effectually as they would do their own self.

What warkes a wife should do in general.
HYrst in a morning when thou art waken and purpose to rise / lift up thy
haude and bless the / and make a sign of the holy cross. In no^e patris et
fi^i^ et spu^ssaneti. A me^. In the name of the father / the sone* and the holy
ghost. And if thou say a Pater noster an A ue and a Creed and remember thy
maker / thou shall speed much the better. And when thou art up and ready /
than first swepe thy house / dress up thy dysshborde / and set al things in
good order within thy house myike thy kye / secle thy calves / lie up thy mylk /
take up thy children / and array them / and provide for thy hus bands brekefast
/ dinner / souper / and for thy children and servants / and take thy part with
them. And to ordeyn corn and malt to the myll / to bake and brue withal when
need is. And mete it to the myll and fro the myll / and se y^ thou have thy
measure again beside the toll*or eis the myller deleth not truly with the /
or else thy corn is not dry as it should be. Thou must make butter and these
when thou may / serve thy swyne both morning and euenyng / and give thy
poleyn mete in the mor nynge / and when time of the year comes? thou must take heed how thy hens / duckes / and gees do ley / and to gather up their eggs /
and when they wax browdy to let them there as no bestes / swyne / nor other
vermyn hurt them. And thou must know that all hole foted fowls will sit a
month / and all cloven foted fowls will sit but three wekes / except a peyhen
and such other great fowls / as cranes / bustardes / and such other. And
wha^ they have brought forth their birds to se that they be well kept from
the gleyd / crows / fully martes / and other vermin. And in the beginning of
March or a little before / is time for a wife to make her garden / and to get as
many good seeds and herbs as she can / and specially such as be good for the
pot and to eat / and as often as need shall require it must be weded / or else
the wede will ouergrowe the herbs. And also in March is time to sow flax
and hemp / for I have herd old huswyues say: y^ better is March hurdes than
Apryll flax / y^ reason apereth / but how it should be sowe^ / weded / pulled /
repeyled / watered / wasshen / dried / beten / braked / tawed / hekled / spon /
wou^den / wrapped / and wouen / it needs not for me to show / for they be wise
enough / and thereof may they make shetes / boordclothes / towels / shertes /
smockes / and such other necessaryes / and therefore let thy dystaffe be always
ready for a pastyme / that thou be not idle. And surely a woman can not get her
living honestly with spynnynge on the dystaffe / but it stops a gappe / and
must needs be had. The bolles of flax when they be rypeled of must be redyled
from the wedes and made dry with the son to get out y^ seeds. How be it one
manner of lynsede called loken sede will not open by y^ son / and therefore
when they be dry they must be sore bruised and broken / the wives know how /
and than wynowed and kept dry till year time come again. Thy female hemp
must be pulled from the churl hemp / for that bears no sede / and thou must
do by it as thou dydest by y^ flax. The churl hemp does bear sede / and thou
must beware that birds eat it not as it grows / y^ hemp thereof / is not so
good as the female hemp / but yet it will do* good service. It may fortune
sometime that thou shall have so many things to do? that thou shall not well
know where best is to begin. Tha^ take heed which thing should be y^ gretest
loss if it were not done / and in what space it would be don / and than think
what is the gretest loss there begin. But I put case that y^ thing that is of
the greatest loss will be long in doing / y^ thou might do three or four
other things in y^ mean while / than look if all these things were set to
gyger which of them were the gretest loss / and yfall these things be of
greter loss / and may be all don in as short space as y^ other / than do thy
many things first. It is co^uenyent for a husband to have sheep of his own
for many causes / and than may his wife have part of the woll to make her
husband and her self some clothes. And at the least way she may have y^ locks
of y^ sheep either to make clothes or blankettes and couerlettes / or both /
and if she have no woll of her own / she may take woll to spynne of clothe
makers / and by that menes she may have aco^uenyent living / and many times to
do other warkes. It is a wives occupacyon to wynowe al manner corns / to make
malt / to wasshe and wrynge to make hey / to shere corn / and in time of need
to help her husband to fill the mucke wayne or donge cart / drive the ploughe
/ to lode hey / corn / and such other Also to go or ride to the merket to
sell butter / chese / milk / eggs / chekyns / capons / he^nes / pigges / gese
/ and all manner of corns. And also to bye al manner of necessary things
belongyng to household / and to make a true reckoning and account to her husband
what she has received and what she has paid. And if the husband go to the
merket to bye or sell (as they often do) he than to show his wife in like manner.
For if one of them should use to deceive ye other? he deceyueth him self / and
he is not like to thryue / and therefore they must be true either to other. I
could parauenture show the husband of diverse points that the wives deceive
their husbands in / and in like manner how husbands deceive their wives / but
and I should do so? I should show more subtle points of deceyte than either of
them knew of before / and therefore me seems best to hold my peace / lest I
should do as the knight of the toure did / the which had many fair daughters /
and of fatherly love yt he ought to them? he made a book to a good intent /
that they might eschew and flee from vices and follow virtues. In the which
book he showed that if they were wowed / moved or styred by any man after
such a manner as he there showed yt they should with stand it / in ye which book
he showed so many ways how a man should attain to his purpose to bring a
woman to vice / the which ways were so natural and the ways to come to their
purpose was so subtylly contryued and craftly showed / that hard it would be
for any woman to resist or deny their desire. And by the said book has made
both the men and the women to know more vices / subteltye and craft / than
ever they should have known if the book had not ben made / the which book
he named him self the knight of the toure. And thus I leave the wives to use
their occupacyons at their own dyscressyon.

To keep measure in spending.
NOw thou husband and huswyfe that have done your dylygence and cure
according to ye first article of the philosopher / that is to say. Adhibe
cura^. And also has well remembered the sayng of wise Solomon. Quod ociosus no^
gaudebit cu^ electis in celo: fed lugebit in eternu^ cum reprobis in inferno.
Than ye must remember / observe / and keep in mind the second article of the
saying of ye said philosopher / that is to say. Tene mensura^. That is to say
in english hold and keep measure. And according to that saying I learned two
verses at gra^mer scole / and those be these. Qui plus expendit: quam rerum
copia tendit: non admiretur: si paupertate grauet. He yt does more expe^de:
than his goods will exte^de? marvel it shall not be: though he be grieved with
poverty. And also according to that saying speaks saint Paul and says.
Juxta facultates faciendi su^t su^ptus ne longi te^poris victu^ breu^ horas
co^sumat. That is to say / after thy faculty or thy hauour make thyn expe^ces /
lest thou spend in short space that thing yt thou sholdest live by long.
This text touches every man from ye highest degree to the lowest / wherefore it
is necessary to every man and woman to remember and take good head thereunto /
for to observe / keep / and follow the same / but because this text of saint
Paul is in latin / and husbands commonly can but little latin? I fere lest
they can not under sta^dit. And though it were declared ones or twyse to them
yt they would forget it. wherefore I shall show to them a text in English /
and that they may well understand / and that is this. Eat within thy tedure.

To eat within thy tedure.
THou husband and huswyfe that entendeth to follow the saying of the
philosopher / that is to say / keep measure. Thou must spare at the brynke and
not at the bottom / that is to be understand in the beginning of the year
sellyng of thy corns / or spending in thy house unto ye time that thou have
sown again thy winter corn and thy lent corn / and than se what remains
to serve thy house / and of the overplus thou maysie sell and bye such other
necessaryes as thou must needs occupy. And if thou spend it in ye beginning
of the year and shall want in y^ hinder end / than thou do not eat within thy
tedure / and at the last thou shall be punysshed / as I shall prove the by
ensample. Take thy horse and go tedure him upon thyn own lees flytte him as often
as thou wylt / no man will say thou doste wrong / but make thy horse to long a
tedure that when thou have tied him upon thyn own lees his tedure is so long
that it recheth to the mids of an other man's lees or corn. Now have y^
given him to much lybertye / and that man that thy horse has eten his corn
or grass / will be grieved at the / and will cause ye to be amerced to be in ye
court / or else to make him ame^des or both. And if thy horse break his
tedure and go at large in every maus corn and grass? tha^ comes the pynder
and takes him and puts him in the pynfolde / and there shall he stand in
prison without any mete unto the time thou have paid his rauniom to the pynder /
and also make amends to thy neighbors for destroynge of their corn. Right so
as long as thou etest within thy tedure / that thou nedest not to beg nor
borowe of no man / so long shalt thou encrese and grow in richesse / and
every man will be content with the. And if thou make thy tedure to long / that
thine own porcyon will not serve the / but that thou shall beg / borow / or
bye of other / that will not long endure / but thou shall fall in to poverty.
And if y^ break thy tedure and ron riot at large / and know not other men's
goods from thyn own / than shall the pynder y^ is to say / the sheryff and
the bailey arest the / and put the in to the pynfolde / yt is to say / in
prison / there to abide till the treuthe be known / and it is marvel and
thou escape with thy life / and therefore eat within thy tedure.

A short lesson for the husband.
ONe thing I will auyse the remember / and speryal ly in winter / when thou
syttest by ye fire and have souped / to co^sydre in thy mind whether y^ warkes
yt thou / thy wife / and thy servants shall do / be more auau^ tage to the
than y^ fire and candell light / meat and drynk yt they shall spend / and if it
be more auau^tage / than sit still / and if it be not / than go to thy bed and
sleep / and be up betyme and break thy fast before day / that thou may be
all the short wynters day about thy busynes. At gra^mer scole I learned a
verse / and that is this. Sanat sanctificat et dicat surgere mane. That is to
say / erly rysynge makes a man hole in body / holer in soul / and rycher in
goods. And this me seems should be a suffy cyent instruccyon for the husband
to keep measure.

How do men of hye degree keep measure.
TO me it is doubtful / but as me seems they be rather to lyberal in expenses
than to scarce / and specially in three things. The first is prodigalyte in
outragyous and costly array fa^re above measure the second thing is costly
charge of delycyous meats and drynkes / the third is outragyous play and
game far a^oue all measure. And now to the first point.

Prodigalite in outragyous and costly array.
I Have seen books of account of the yemen of the wardrobes of noble me^ / and
also inue^toties made after their decease of their appareyll / and I double not
but at this day it is. xx. times more in value tha^ it was to such a man in
degree as he was an. C. year a go / and many times it is given away or it be
half worn to a simple man / y^ which causes him to were the same / and an
other simple man or a little better / seeing him to were such raiment: thinks
in his mind y^ he may were as good raiment as he: causes him to by such
other to his great cost and charge and above me sure / and an ill example to
all other / and also to se me^nes servants so abused i^ their array / their
cotes be so side that they be feign to tucke them up when they ride / as women
do their kyrtels when they go to the market or other places / the which is an
vnco^uenyent sight. And forthermore they have such pleytes upon their breasts
and ruffes upon their sleues above their elbowes / that and their master or
them self had never so great need they could not shote one shote to hurt
their enmyes till he have cast of his cote, or cut of his sleues / this is
far above mesure. This began first with honor / worship and honesty / and it
ends in pride / presumpcyon and poverty. whereof speaks saint Austyn.
Que^cunque superbum esse videris / diaboli filium esse ne dubites. That is to
say / who so ever thou see that is proud? doubt the not, but he is the sone
of the deuyil. wherefore against pride he byddeth the remember, Quoth fuisti, q^
es, et qualis post mortem eris. That is to say / what you were, what you art? and
what thou shalt be after thy death. And saint Bernard says. Homo ni^hil alies
qua^ sperma fetidu^, saccus stercoru^, et esca vermiu^. That is to say / a man
is nothing but stynkyng fylth / a sack of donge / and worms mete / the which
saynges would be remembered / and than me seems this is suffycyent at this
time, for the first point of the three.

Of delycyous meats and drynkes.
THe costly charges of delycyous metes and drynkes y^ be now most commonly used
over y^ it has been in times past and far above measure. For I have seen
books of account of houssholde and brume^tes upon the same / and I doubt not
but i^ delicyous metes / dri^kes and spyces / there is at this day four time
so moch^ spent as was at these days to a like man in degree and yet at ye time
there was as much befe and mutton spent as is now / and as many good
housholdes kept and as many yemen wayters therein as benow. This began with love
and charity / when a lord / gentylman or yema^ desyredor prayed an other to
come to dinner or souper / and by cause of his comi^ge he would have a dysshe or
to two mo than he would have had if he had been away. Than of very love he
remembering how louyngly he was bydden to dinner / and how well he fared / he
thiketh of very kyndnes he must needs bid him to dinner again / and so ordey
neth for him as many manner of such dysshe meats as ye other man did and. ii.
or. iii. moo / and thus by little and little it is come^ far above measure.
And begone of love and charity / and ends in pride and glotony / whereof saint
Jerome says. Qui post carne^ ambula^t in ventre^ et libidine^ proni sunt quasi
irrationabilia iume^te reputa^tur. That is to say / they that walk and be
ready to fulfill ye lust of ye flesh and the belly / are taken as unreasonable
feestes / and saint Gregory says. Dn^ante vicio gule oe^s virtutes pro
luxuria^ et vana^ gloria^ obruu^tur. That is to say / where ye vice of glotony
has dn^acyon all virtues by luxury and vaynglory as cast under / the which
sayenges would in likewise be remembered / and this me seems snfficient for ye
second point of y^ three.

Of outragyous play and game.
IT is convenient for every man of what degree that he be of to have play and
game according to his degree. For Cathon says. Interpone tuis iterdu^ gaudia
curis. Among thy charges or busynes thou must have sometime joy and myrthe /
but now a days it is done far above measure. For now a poor man in regard
will play as great game at all manner games as ge^tylmen were wont to do / or
greter / and gentylme^ as lords / and lords as princes / and often times the
great estates will call gentylmen or yemen to play with them at as great game as
they do / and they call it a dysporte / the which me seems a very true name to
it / for it dyspleaseth some of them or they depart / and specially god for
myspendynge o^ his goods and time. But and they played small game yt the poor man that playth might bear it though he lost and bate not his cou^tenau^ce /
than might it be called a good game / a good play / a good sport and a pastyme.
But when one shall lose upon a day or upon a night as much money as would find
him and al his house mete and drink a month or a quarter of a year or more /
yt may be well called a dysporte or a dyspleasure / and often times by y^ menes
thereof it causes them to sell their lands / disheryt y^ heirs / and may
fortune to fall to theft / robery / or such other / to y^ great hurt of the^
self and of their children / and to y^ dysplesure of god / and they so doing /
little do they pondre or regard y^ saying of saint Paul. Juxta facultates
faciendi su^t su^ptus ne lo^gi tperis victu^ breuis horas co^sumat. This play
began with love and charity / and often times it ends with covetous / wrath / and
envy. And this me thinks should be a suffycye^t instruccyon for keeping of
measure.

A prologue of the third saying of y^ philosopher.
NOw thou husband and huswyfe that have done your diligence and cure about
your husbandry and huswyfry according to ye first saying of the philosopher. A
dhibe cura^. And also has well remembered and full filled the second sayng of
the said philosopher. Tene mensura^. Now I doubt not ye be rich according to
the third saying of the philosopher. Eteris dives. Now I have showed the the
sayng of the philosopher whereby thou have gote^ much wordly possessyo^ / me se
meth it were necessary to show you how ye may get heavenly possessions /
according to ye saying of our lord in his gospel. Quid prodest homini si
vniuersu^ mu^du^ lucretur / at^e verro sue detrime^tu^ paciat / what profy
tethit a man though he wyn al ye world to y^ hyndrau^ce and lesynge of his
soul. How beit / it should seem vnco^ue nyent for a temporal man to take upon
him to show or teache any such spyrytuall matters. How beit there is a great
dyuersyte between predicacyon and doctrine.

A dyuersyte between predicacyon and doctrine.
HS saint Jerome says there is great dyffere^ce or diversity between prechynge
and doctrine. A preaching or a sermon is where a conuocacyo^ or a gatherynge of
people on holy days or other days in chirches or other places / and times set
and ordained for ye same. And it belongs to them yt be ordained thervn to and
have iurys^iccyon and auctoryte and to non other. But every man may inform and
teache his brother or any other at every time and place behouable / if it seem
expedient to him? for yt is an alms deed / to the which every man is holden
and bound to do according to the saying of saint Peter. Unusquisque sicut
accipit gratia^ in alterutru illam administrare debet. That is to say / as
every man has taken or received grace he ought to mynystre and show it forth
to other. For as Crysostome says great merit is to him / and a great reward
he shall have in time to come / the which writes or cauieth to be wryte^ holy
doctrine for that intent that he may se in it how he may live holyly and that
other may have it. That they may be edyfyed or sanctyfyed by the same / for he
says surely / know thou that how many souls be saved by the / so many
rewards thou shall have for either. For saint Gregory says. Nullum
sacrificium ita placet deo ficut zelus animarum. There is no sacrefyce that
pleases god so much as y^ love of souls. And also he says. Ille apud deum
mayor est in amore: qui ad eius amore^ plurimos trahit. He is gretest in favor
with god? that draws most men to the love of god. wherefore me seems it is
conuenyent to inform and show them how they may get heavenly possessions: as
well as I have showed them to get worldly possessions. Than to my purpose and
to the point where I left / now thou art rich.

what is riches.
IT is to be understand what is riches / and as me seems riches is that
thing that is of goodness / and can not be taken away fro the owner / neither
in his temporal life: nor in the life everlasting. Than these wordly
possessions that I have spoken

(...) god has set it on a price and granted it to every man and given to
them days of payment / the price is all one / and that is keep his
commandments during their lives / the good men keep his commandments /
and fulfill their promise / and have heaven for y^ same at their decese. The ill
men break promise / and keep not his co^maudeme^tes / wherefore at their
decease they be put in prison / yt is to say / in purgatory / there to abide
the mercy of god / or in hell / there to abide his ryghtwysnes. And so the ill
men bye hell derer than y^ good me^ bye heaven / and therefore it is better to
forgo a little pleasure or suffer a little pain in this world: than to suffer a
much greter and a longer pain in another world. Now sith hell is derer than
heaven / I auyse the specially to bye heaven / wherein is everlasting joy without
end.

what joys or pleasures are in heaven.
Saint Austyn says. Ibi eru^t quecu^que ab homi nibus des^dera^t / vita et
salus copia glie / honor / pax / et oia bona. That is to say / there shall be
every thing yt any man desires / there is life / health / plenty of joy /
honor / peace / and all manner of goodness. what would a man have more. And saint
Paul says. Oculus no^ vidit / nec auris audiuit / nec in cor hois asce^dit
que p^perauit deus dilige^tibus se. That is to say / the eye has not seen /
nor the eats has herd / nor the heart of a man has thought of so goodly
things / that god has ordained for the^ that love him. O what a noble act yt
were for an husband or huswyfe to purchase such a royal place in heaven / to ye
which is no co^paryson. Than it is to be known what thing pleases god most
/ that we might do it.

what thing pleases god most.
BY ye text of saint Paul before said / love pleases god above all thing /
and that may be well proved by y^ saying of our lord himself / where he
says. Da mihi cor tuum and sufficit mihi. Give me thy heart and that is
suffycyent for me / for he that has a man's heart has all his other goods /
what is this man's heart / it is nothing else but very true love. For there
can be no true love but it comes meryly and immedyatly from ye heart / and if
thou love god entyerly with thy heart / than will y^ do his commandments
Than it would be understand and known by his commandments that a man may
observe and keep them.

what be gods commandments.
There be in all. x. commandments the which were to long to declare / but
they be all concluded and comprehended in two / that is to say. Diliges dn^m
deu^ tuu^ super oi^a: et proximu^ tuu^ sicut re ipsum. Love thy lord god above
all thing / and thy neighbors as thy self These be light commandments /
and nature byndeth a man to fulfill / observe and keep them / or else he is not
a natural man / remembrynge what god has done for the. First he has made the
to the symylytude and lykenes of his own image / and has given to the in this
world diverse possessions / but specially he has redeemed thy soul upon the
cross / and suffered great pain and passion and bodyly death for thy sake.
what love / what kyndnes was this in him to do for the / what could thou desire
more of him to do for the And he desires nothing of the again but love for
love* what can he desire less.

How a man should love god and please him.
SUrely a man may love god and please him very many ways / but first and
pryncypally he that will love god and please him / he must do as it is said in
Sym^alo Athanas^^. Quicu^que vult saluus esse / ante o^aopus est vt teneat
catholica^ fide^ / who so ever will be saved / above all thing he must needs
be steadfast i^ the faith of holy church. And according to that says ^^nt
Paul. Sine fide ipossibile est placere deo. without faith it is impossyble to
please god. And Seneca says. Nihil retinet qui fide^ perdidit. There abides
no goodness in him y^ has lost his faith. And so thou may well perceive that
thou can not love nor please god without perfyte faith. And ferthermore thou
may not presume to study nor to argue thy faith by reason For saint Gregory
says. Fides no^ habet meritu^ / vbi humana ratio prebet experimentum. Faith
has no merit / where as man's reason proves the same. This faith is a
pryncypall sign that thou love god Also thy good deeds and thy warkes is a
good sign that thou love god. For saint Jerome says. Unusquisque ^^ius
oquea facit / eius filius appellatur. whose wa^^^^ every man does / his sone or
servant he is called. And saint Bernard says. Efficacior est vox operis quam
vox sermonis. The deeds and the warkes of man is more euydent proof than his
words. The fulfyllyng of the. vii. warkes of mercy is an other special sign
that thou love god / and many moo there be / which were to long to rehearse
them all.

How a man should love his neighbor.
THou must love thy neighbor as thy self / wherein thou shall plese god
specially / for and thou love thy neighbor as thy self / it follows by
reason y^ thou shalt do nothing to him but such as thou would should be don
to the. And y^ is to presume yt thou would not have any hurt of thy body nor
of thy goods done unto y^ / and likewise thou sholdest do unto him. And also
if thou would have any goodness done unto y^: other in thy body or in thy
mouable goods / likewise sholdest thou do unto thy neybour* if it lie in thy
power / according to y^ saying of saint Gregory. Nec deus sine proimo / nec
proximus vere diligitur sine deo. Thou can not love god without thou love thy
neybour / nor thou can not love thy neybour without thou love god* wherefore
thou must first love god prin cypally / and thy neighbor secondarely.

Of prayer that pleases god very much.
PRayer is honor and laud to god / and a specyal thing that pleases him
much / and is a great sign that thou love god / and that thou art perfyte
and steadfast in the faith of holy church / and that it is so / it may be well
considered by our forefaders that has for the love and honor of god made
chyrches / abbeys / friar houses / and daily ordeyn and make chauntryes and
hospytalles / and in them have ordained and put parsons / vycars / men and
women of diverse re^ygyons and prestes to sing and pray for them and all
christen souls. And though a man have ordained and made such houses of
relygyon or chauntryes / yet it is not enough for him but he must daily at some
co^uenyent times exercise and use prayer him self / as he is bound to do. For
saint Ambrose says. Relicto hoc ad quod teneris ingratum est spiritui sancto
nu^quid aliud operaris. If thou leave y^ thing undone that thou art bound to
do / it is not acceptable to god / what so ever thou doste else. Than it is
necessary that thou do pray / and a poor man doing his labor truly in the
day and thinks well / than he prayth well / but on the holy day he is bou^ide
to com to the church and here his dyuyne service.

what thing lets prayer.
THere be two impedyme^tes that lets and hinder prayer that it may not be
hard. And of the first impedyme^t speaks Y say the prophet. Quia manus ve^^r^
plene s^t sanguine. i. ptco^ ideo no^ exaudiet vos dn^s. Because your hands be
full of blood / that is to say / full of sin / therefore our lord does not
gracyously here you. And also proverb. iii. Long est dn^s ab ^^iis et or^ones
iustoru^ exaudiet. Our lord is fer^^ fro wicked men / and the prayers of
ryghtwyse men he gracyously hereth. And saint Bernarde says. Quia preceptis
dei auertitur quoth in or^one postulat no^ meretur. He y^ does not godd*
commandments he deserves not to have his prayer. The second impediment
says Anastasius. Si non dimittis iniuria^ que tibi facta est no^ o^one^ pro te
facis / sed maledictione^ super te ^ducis. If thou forgive not the wrong done
unto the / thou doste not pray for thy self / but thou endures gods curse to
fall upon y^. And ^sodorus says. Sicut nullu^ in vulnere proficit medicame^tu^
si ad hur ferru^ in eo sit ita nichil proficiat o^o illius cuius ad huc dolor
in me^te vel odiu^ manet in p^to^re. Like as a plaster or me dycyne can not
hele a wound if there be any yren stye king in y^ same / right so y^ prayer of
a man profyteth him not as long as there is sorrow in his mind or hate
abiding in his breast. For saint Austyn says. Si desit charitas frustra
habentur cetera. If cha^^^^ want? all other things be void. wherefore y^ must
^^ that thou stand in the state of grace and not enfecte with dedly sin / and
than pray if thou will be hard.

How a man should pray.
IT is to be understand that there be diverse manner of prayenges. Quedam
publica / et quedam priuata. That is to say / some openly / and some pry^atly.
Prayer openly must needs be done in the church by the mynystratours of the
same before the people. For it is done for all the comynaltye / and therefore
the people in that ought to conferme the^ self to the said mynystratours / and
there to be present to pray unto god after a due manner. Oration priuata. The
prayer pryuatly done / ought to be done in secret places for two causes. For
prayer eleuateth and lyfteth up a man's mind to god / and the mind of man is
sooner and better lift up when he is in a preuy place and separate from
multitude of people. An other cause is to avoid vaynglory that might lightly
ensue or rise thereupon when it is done openly / and thereof speaks our savior
where he says. Cum oratis non eritis sicut ipocrite qui amant in synagogis /
et in angulis platearum stantes orare. That is to say / when ye pray: be not
you as the ypocrytes? the which love to stand in their synagoges and corners
of hye ways to pray. Also some folks pray with the lyppes or mouth / and not
with the heart / of whom speaks our lord by his prophet. Hi^ labi^s me
honora^t / cor aute^ eorum long est a me. They do honor me with their mouth?
and their hertes be far from me. And saint Gregory sa^yth. Quid prodest
strepitus labiorum / vbi mutu^ est cor. what profyteth the labor of thy
mouth where the heart is dombe. And Isodore says. Long quippe a deo est
animus / q in oratione cogitacionibus seculi fuerit occupatus. His soul is
far from god that in his prayer his mind is occupied in warkes of the
world. There be other that pray both with the mouth and heart / of whom
speaks saint Johan. x. Ueri adoratores / adorabu^t patre^ in sp^u et veritate
The true prayers will worship the father of heaven in spyryt and with troth.
Isodorus says. Tunc veraciter oramus / qua^do aliunde non cogitamus. Than we
pray truly / when we think on nothing else. Richardus de Hampole. Ille
deuote orat qui non habet cor vacabundum in terrenis occupationibus / sed
sublatu^ ad deum in celestibus. He prayth deuoutely that has not his heart
wauerynge in wordly occupacyons / but always subleuate and lift up to god in
heaven. There be other that pray with the heart. vn^. Math. vi. Tu autem cu^
oraueris intra cubiculu^ tuum. i. in loco secreto et clauso hostio / ora patrem
tuum. when thou shall pray / enter into thy chamber or oratory and steke the
door and pray to the father of heaven. Isodorus. Ardius oration est no^ labioru^
sed cordiu^ / potius enim orandu^ e^ cordequam ore. The hoter prayer is with
the heart than with the lyppes / rather pray with thy heart than with thy
mouth. Regum primo. Anna loquebatur in cord. Anne spoke with the heart.

A mean to put away idle thoughts in prayenge.
ANd to avoid wauerynge minds / in wordly occupacyons when thou shalt pray
/ I shall show unto you the best experyence that ever I could find for ye
same / the which have been much troubled therewith / and that is this. He that
can read and understand latin / let him take his book in his hand and look
steadfastly upon the same thing that he redeth and sees / that is no trouble
to him / and remember the English of the same / wherein he shall find great
swetnes / and shall cause his mind to follow y^ same / and to leave other wordly
thoughts. And he that can not read nor understand his Pater noster / Aue / nor
creed: he must remember the passion of Christ / what pain he suffered for him
and all mankind / for redemynge of their souls. And also the miracles and
wonders that god has done / and first what wonders were done the night of his
natiuite and birth. And how he turned water in to wine / and made the blind to
se / the dombe to speak / the defe to here / the same to go / the sick to be
hole. And how he fed. v. M. with two fysshes and five barley loves / whereof
was left. xii. maundes or baskettes of fragmentes. And how he reysyd Lazare
from death to life / with many more miracles that be innumerable to be
rehearsed. And also to remember the special points of his passion how he was
sold and betrayed of Judas / and taken by the jews and brought before Pylate
/ than to king Herod / and to bishop Cayphas / and than to Pylate again that
iuged him to death / and how he was bound to a pyller and scourged him and
bobbed him / mocked him / spytte in his face / crowned him with thorns / and
caused him to bear the cross to the mount of Caluary / whereupon he was
nailed both hands and fete / and wounded to the heart with a sharp spear /
and so suffered death. And how he set out the souls of our forefaders forth of
hell. How he rose from death to life / and how often he apered to his dyscyples
and other moo. And what miracles he wrought afterward / and specially what
power he gave to his dyscyples that were no clerks to teache and preche his
faith and work many miracles / and specially when they preched before men of
diverse nacyons and languages / and every man understood them in their own
language / the which is a sign that god would have every man saved / and to
know his laws the which was a miracle able to co^uerte all the infydeles /
heretykes / and lollers in the world.

A mean to avoid temptacyon.
IT is often times seen / that the holyer that a man is / the more he is tempted
/ and he that so is / may thank good thereof / for god of his goodness and grace
has not given to the devil auctoryte nor power / to attempt any man ferther
and above that / that he that is so tempted may withstand. For saint Gregorye
says. Non est timendum hostis / qui non potest vincere nisi volentem. An enemy
is not to be dradde / the which may not be overcome / but if a man by
willing. And it is to presume / that he that is so tempted stands in y^
state of grace. For saint Ambrose says Illos diabolus vexare necligit quos
iure hereditario se possidere sentit. The devil despyseth to vex or trouble
those the which he feleth himself to have in possessyon by right herytaunce.
And if thou be so tempted / vexed / or troubled I shall show unto y^ two
verses / that and thou do thereafter / thou shall be eased of thy temtacyon /
and have great thank and laud of god and reward therefore / these be the
verses. Hostis non ledit / nisi cum te^ptatus obedit. Est leo si sedit / si
stat quasi musca recedit. That is to say / the ghoostly enemy hurts not /
but when he that is tempted obeys to his temptacyon / than this ghoostly
enemy plays the lion / if that he that is tempted sit still and obey to him.
And if he that is tempted / stand styfly against him / the ghoostly enemy
flies away like a fly. This me seems may be well proved by a famylyer
ensample. As a lord had a castle / and delivered it to a capytayn to keep /
if there come enemies to the castle / and call to the capytayn and bid him
deliver them this castle. The capytayne comes and opens them the gates /
and delyuereth the keys. Now is this castle soon won / and this capytayne
is a false traitor to the lord. But let the capytayn arm him self and shyt
the gates / and stand styfly upon the walls / and to command them to avoid
at their peril / they will not tarry to make any assaute. Right so every man is
capytayne of his own soul / and if thy ghostely enemy come and tempte the /
and thou that art capytayn of thine own soul will open the gates and deliver
him y^ keys and let him in / thy soul is sone taken prisoner / and thou a
false traitor to thy soul / and worthy to be punysshed in prison for ever.
And if thou arm thy self and stand styfly against him / and will not consent
to him / he will avoid and fly away / and thou shalt have a great reward
for withstanding of the said temptacyon.

Alms deeds pleases god much.
Alms deeds pleases god very much / and it is a great sign that thou
love both god and thy neighbor. And he of whom alms is asked ought to
consydre three things / that is to say / who asks alms / what he asks /
and where unto he asks Now to the first / who asks alms. Deus petit. God
asks. For saint Jerome says. Quia deus adeo diligit pauperes quam quicquid
fit eis propter amorem suum^ reputat sibi factum. That is to say: because that
god loves pore men so much / what some ever thing is given unto them for the
love of him? he takes it as it were done to him self / as it is said in his
gospel. Quod vni ex minimis meis fecistis / michi feecistis.

That thing that ye give or do to ye lest of those that be mine / ye do it to
me. Than to the second / what asks god. Non nostrum / sed suum. He asks not
that thing that is ours / but that thing that is his own As says the
prophet David. Tua sunt dn^e oia / et que de manu tua accepimus tibi dedimus.
Good lord / all things be thine / and those things that we have taken of
the? of those have we given the. Than to the third. where unto god does ask.
He asks not to give him? but al only to borow. Non tamen ad triplos / sz imo
ad centuplas. Not all only to have thryse so much / but for sothe to have an
hundred times so much. As saint Austyn says. Miser homo quid veneraris /
homini venerare deo et centuplu^ accipies / et vitam eternal possidebis. Thou
wretched man / why do thou worship or dread man / worship thou god and dread
him / and thou shalt receive an hundred times so much / and have in
possessyon everlasting life / the which many told passes all other rewards.
Prouerbiorum. xiiii. Ueneratur dn^s qui miseretur paupe ribus. He worshyppeth
our lord that has mercy and pity on pore folks. And the gloss thereof says.
Centuplum accepturus. And thou shalt receive an hundred times so much. And it
is to be understand that there be three manner of alms deeds / that is to say.
Egenti largire quicquid poteris / dimittere eis a quibus Jesus fueris. Errantem
corrigere / et in viam veritatis reducere. That is to say / to give to the
nedy what thou well may / to forgive them that have trespaced to the / and to
correct them that do amysse / and to bring them into the way of right.

The first manner of alms deeds.
OGenti largire quidqd poteris Give to the nedy what thou well may / for our
lord says in his gospel. Date elemosinam et oia munda sunt vobis: et alibi
date et dabitur vobis. Give alms and all worldly riches is yours / give? and
it shall be given to you. Alms deed is a holy thing / it increases a man's
welthe / it makes less a man's sins / it lengthyns a man's life / it
makes a man of good mind / it de lays ill times / and closes all things /
it delyuereth a man fro death / it joins a man with angels / and seuereth
him fro the devil / and is like a wall unable to ^^ foughten against. And saint
James says. Sicut aqua ertinguit ignem / ita elemonisa extinguit pecca tum. As
water slaketh fire? so does alms deed slake sin. Salamon says. Qui dat
pauperi* non indige bit. He that gives unto a poor man shall never have need /
and also he says. Qui obturat aurem suam ad clamorem pauperis / et ipse
clamabit et non exaudietur. He that stops his ear at the clamor or cry of
a poor man (he shall cry) and he shall not be gracyously herd. There may no
man excuse him from gyuynge of alms / though he be but pore. And let him
do as the poor wydowe did that offered a ferthynge / wherefore she had more
thank and reward of god? than the rich men that offered gold. And if thou
may not give a ferthynge? give less / or give fair words or good iformacyo^
/ ensample / and tok^^ and god shall reward the both for thy deed and for thy
good will. And that thou do? do it with a good will. For saint Paul says.
Hilarem datorem diligit deus. God does love a glad gyuer / and that it be of
true begoten goods. For Solomon says. De tuis iustus laboribus ministra
pauperibus. Of thy true labors mynystre and give to the poor folks. For
Isodorus says. Qui unjust tollit* just nunquam tribuit He that takes
wrongfully? can not give truly. For it is written. Ecclesiastict. xxxv. Qui de
rapinis / aut vsu^is / aut de fu^to unmo lat: est quasi qui coram patre
victimat filium. He that offers of the gods that he gets by extorcyon /
usury / or theft / he is like as a man slew the sone in the presence of the
father / thou may right well know: the father would not be well content. No
more would god be pleased with the gift of such begoten goods.

The second manner of alms.
DImittere eis a quibus Jesus fueris. To forgive them that have trespaced to
the / wherein thou shall please god much. For it is in the gospel of saint
Mark. xi. Si non dimiseritis aliis / nec pater ves^ erceles^ is di^^^et vobis
p^ta^ vestra. If you forgive not: the father of Heaven will not forgive the thy
sins. Also and if thou do not forgive other? thou shalt be found a liar /
as often as thou say thy Pater noster. where thou say. Et dimitte nobis
debita nostra: sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris. And forgive to us
our dettes / as we forgive to our detters. By these dettes may be understand
the things that we ought to do to god / and do not them. And also the
trespaces and the sin that we have offend god in? that we ask mercy of. And
if thou wylt not forgive thou may not ask mercy of right. Eadem mensura qua
mensi fueritis remisietur vobis. The same measure that ye do meat other men
by? the same shall be moten to you. Dimittere autem rancore^ et maliciam om^ino
necessitatis est / dimitere vero actione^ et emen dam opus est consilij. To
forgive al rancour and malice that a man owes to the in his heart / thou art
bound of necessyte to forgive? but to forgive all the hole trespace: or to
leave thine accyon or a reasonable mendes. Therefore it is but a deed of mercy if
thou so do / and no sin though thou sue the law with charity. But and a man
have done to the a trespace / and that thou art glad that he has so done /
that thou may have a quarrel / a matter / or an accyon against him / and now
of malice and ill will? thou wylt sue him / rather than for the trespace / now
thou synnest dedly / because thou do it rather of malice than for the
trespace / and than have thou lost thy charity. Prouerbiorum. xxxij. Qui pronus
est ad misericordiam been dicetur. He that is ready to forgive / shall be
blessed.

The third manner of alms.
ERrantem corrigere / et in viam veritatis reducere. To correct a mysdoer / and
to bring him into the way of right. It is to be understand that there be
three manner of correccyons. The first correccyon is of an enmy / the second is
of a friend / and the third correccyon is of a justice. The first says
Crisostome. Corripe no^ vt hostis expetens vindicta^ / sed vt medicus
instituens medicinam. Correct not as an enemy doing vengeauns / but as a
physycyon or surgyon: mynystrynge or gyuynge a medycyne. To the second says
Solomon. Plus proficit amica correctio quam correctio turbulenta. A frendely
correccyon profyteth more than a troublous correccyon / for and if thou speak
curteysly to a man that has offended / and with sweet words of compassyon /
he shall rather be converted by them / than with hye words of great
punysshement. And Isodorus says. Qui per verba blanda castigatus non
corrigetur / acrius necesse est vt arguatur. He that will not be chastysed by
fair words? it is necessary that he be more hardlyer and straitlyer reproved
or punysshed. To the third says saint Jerome. Equu^ iudiciu^ est vbi no^
persona sed opera co^sidera^tur. There is an evil judgment / where the
person is not regarded / but the warkes are co^sydred And also it is written.
Reddet vnicu^que iuxta opera sua. He shall yield unto every man after his
warkes. And saint Austyn says. Sicut meliores sunt quos corrigit amor / ita
plures su^t quos corrigit timor. As those be better that be chastysed by love?
there be many mo that be chastysed by fear. For and they feared not the
punysshement of the law? there would be but a few chastysed by love. And
saint Gregory says. Facie^tis procul dubio culpa^ habet qui quoth potest
corrigere negligit emendare / et illicita no^ prohibere consensus err^ ris est.
He that may correct and does not / he takes the offense to him self of the
deed / and he that does not forbid unlawful things? co^senteth to the same.

what is the greatest offense that a man may do and offend god in.
IN mine opinion / it is to be in despair of the mercy of god. And therefore
what so ever thou have done or offended god / in word / warke / thought / or
deed / be never i despair for it, for Isodorus says Qui venia^ de p^to^
desperate / plus de desperatio^e peccat quam de culpa cadit. He y^ despayreth to
have forgyuenes of his sins? he synneth more in despayring than he did in ye
sin doing. For saint Jerome says. Magis offendebat Judas deu^ in hoc quoth se
suspendit? quam in hoc quam eum tradidit. Judas offended god more in that ^ he
hanged him self? than he did when he betrayed god. For god says in his
gospel. Nolo morte^ p^to^ris sed magis vt co^uertatur et viuat. I will not ye
death of of a sinner? but rather that he may be converted and live. And also
says. No^ veni b^care iustos / sed p^to^res ad penitentiam. I am not come to
call ryghtwyse men: but to call sinners to do penance. For thou can not so sone
cry god mercy with thy heart / but he is as ready to change his sentence and to
grant ye mercy and forgyuenes of all thy sins. For saint Austyn says.
Sicut scintilla ignis in medio maris? sic om^is impietas viri ad misericordia^
dei. As a spark of fire is in co^paryso^ able to dry up all the water in the sea? no more is all the wyckednes of man unto the mercyfulnes of god. And
therefore it is co^uenyent that a man should be penytente / contryte / and ask
god mercy and forgyuenes of his sins and offenses that he has done / whereof
speaks Crysostome. Nemo ad deum aliquando flens accessit quod no^ postulauerit
accepit. No man has gone any time weeping to god / but he has taken or had
that thing that he has asked. And saint Bernarde says. Plus crucia^t lacrime
p^to^ris diabolu^ quam omne genus tormentorum. The teres of a sinner turmenteth
the devil more / than all other kinds of turmentes. And saint Austyn says.
Acriores dolores demonibus non inferrimus quam cum p^ta^ nostra penitendo et
confitendo plangimus. we ca^ not do more sharper sorrows to the devil / than
when we wayle or weep in co^fessyon / and doing of penance. And that may be
well proved by Mary Magdaleyn when she kneled down and cried god mercy / and
kyst his fete / and washed them with the tears of her eyes / and wyped them
with the hear of her head / to who^ our lord said / as is in his gospel.
Dimuttuntur tibi p^ta^ tua. Thy sins are forgyue^ to the / and also said to
her. Fides te saluu^ fecit / vade in pace. Thy says has saved the / go thou
in peace. To the which mercy and peace I beseech almighty Jesu bring all
christen souls.

Amen.
BE it known to all men both spyrytuall and temporal / that I make
protestacyon before god and man that I entende not to write any thing that is
or may be contrary to the faith of Ehryste and all holy church. But I am ready
to revoke my saying / if any thing have passed my mouth for want of lernyng
and to submyt my self to correccyon / and my book to reformacyon. And as
touching the points of husbandry / and of other artycles contained in this
present book / I will not say that it is the best way and will serve best in
all places / but I say it is the best way that ever I could prove by
experyence / the which have been an householder this. xl. years and more And
have assayd many and diverse ways / and done my dylygence to prove by
experyence which should be the best way.

The auctours.
^O little quayre: and recomende me
To all that this treatise: shall se / here / or read /
Praynge them: therewith contented to be
And to amend it: in places where as is need
Of eloquence: they may perceive I want the sede
And rethoryke (in me) does not habounde
wherefore I have sown: such seeds as I found.
Thus ends the book of Husbandry.
