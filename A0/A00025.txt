OF these, the first, is He, that did Unite,
The two sweet Roses; made Contention, Peace:
The second, He, at whose Maiestique sight,
All that opposd him did recoile and cease.
The third, young Edward, of that name the sixth,
Where pious thoughts and Royal blood were mixed.
The Fourth Queen Mary; (in this steame, a stain,)
To Rome, a friend, but to the Truth, a Foe;
The Fifth Eliza, in whose blessed Reign,
Not any room was left, for Rome, to show
A wooden God, to kneel to: Truth and She.
One Septer swaied, with one clear eye did see.
The Sixth is He, that now makes Englands Seat,
The Seat of Virtue, (that including all,
The Stock of Goodness) One, as Good as Great,
Before whose Shine, Clowded abuses fall:
The seventh, that Prince, that while he here did live,
As Fair Hopes gave, as ere fresh youth could give.
The Eight, Queen Anne, The Ninth, the Royal Charles:
The Tenth Elizabeth (of these) the last
Her Royal Husband: All these, Lucent Pearls
That in their Virtues, such a luster cast,
As all admire, and Love. Who to the Fame
Of these bear Envy, may they end in Sham^
