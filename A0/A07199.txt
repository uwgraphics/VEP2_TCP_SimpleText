The Kings Good- night.
^ WElcome, welcome King of- guests, With thy Prince- ly train: ^ With joyful
Triumphs, and with Feasts, Be welcomed home again. Frolic mirth, the soul
of ^ earth, Shall watch for thy de- light: Knees shall bend, From friend to

The Kings Good night.
^ WElcome, welcome King of guests, with thy Princely train: with joyful
triumphs and ^ with feasts, Be welcomed home again, Frolic mirth, The soul
of earth, Shall watch for thy delight: Knees shall ^ bend, From friend to
friend, While full cups do thee right, And so great King good night, good ^
night, good night, good night, good night.

Welcome, welcome as the Sun,
When the night is past:
With us the day is now begun,
May it for ever last.
Such a morn
Did nere adorn
The Roses of the East,
As the North
Has now brought forth:
The Northern morn is best,
And so best King good rest.
IIII.
^ COme follow me my wandering mates, Sons and daughters of the Fates: Friends
of ^ night, that often have done homage to the horned Moon. Fairly march, and
shun not light, With such stars as these made ^ bright. Yet bend you low your
curled tops, Touch the hallowed earth, and then rise a- gen With anticke ^ hops
vnus'd of men. Here no danger is nor fear, For true Ho-nour harbors here,
Whom Grace attends. ^ Grace can make our foes our friends. ^

V.
A Ballad.
^ DIDO was the Carthage Queen, And loved the Trojan Knight, That ^ wandering
ma-ny coasts had seen, And many a dreadful fight: As they on hunting road, a
show ^ Drove them in a loving hour, Down to a darkesome eaue: Where Ae-neas
with his charms, Locked Queen ^ Dido in his arms, And had what he could have.
^

2
Dido Hymen's Rites forgot,
Her love was winged with haste:
Her honor she considered not,
But in her breast him placed.
And when her love was new begun,
Jove sent down his winged Son,
To fright Aeneas sleep:
Bad him by the break of day
From Queen Dido steal away:
Which made her wail and weep.
3
Dido wept, but what of this?
The Gods would have it so:
Aeneas nothing did amiss,
For he was forced to go.
Learn Lordings then no faith to keep
With your Loves, but let them weep;
It Is folly to be true:
Let this Story serve your turn,
And let twenty Didoes burn,
So you get daily new.
VI.
The Dance.
^ ROBIN is a lovely Lad, No Less a smo- there ever had. ^ TOmmy has a look
as bright, As is the to- sie morning light. ^ TIB is dark and brown of hue,
But like her color firm and true. ^ GInny has a lip to kiss, Where- in a
spring of Nectar is. ^ SImkin well his mirth can place and words to win a
woman's grace. ^ SIB is all in all to me, There is no Queen of Love but she. ^

VI.
All. ^ Let us in a lovers round, Circle all this hallowed ground. Softly,
softly, ^ trip and go; trip and go, The light foot Fairies iet it so, iet it
so. Forward then, Forward then, and ^ back again, and back again; Here and
there, and every where, and every where; Winding to and winding fro; ^ skipping
hye, and lowting low. Chorus. ^ And like lovers hand in hand march a ^ Chorus.
^ round, march a round, and make a stand. ^


VII.
A Song.
^ THE shadows darkning our in- tents, Must fade, and ^ truth now take her
place: Who in our right Egyptian race, A chain of prophecies presents; ^ With
which the starry Sky con- sents, And all the vnder-Elements. Thou that art all
divine ^ give ear, And grace our humble songs, That speak what to thy state
belongs. ^ Unmasked now and clear, Which we in several strains di- uide,
And Heauen-borne ^ ^ Truth our Notes shall guide, One by one, while we re-
late That which shall ^ tie both Time and Fate. ^

The shadows darkning out intents,
Must fade, and Truth now take her place:
Who in our right Egyptian race,
A chain of Prophecies presents,
With which the starry Sky consents,
And all the vnder-Elements.
Thou that art all divine, give ear,
And grace our humble Songs,
That speak what to thy State belongs
Unmasked now and clear:
Which we in several strains divide,
And heauen-borne Truth our Notes shall guide,
One by one, while we relate
That which shall tie both Time, and Fate.
VIII.
^ TRuth, sprung from heaven, shall shine with her beams di-uine, on all thy
Land, ^ And there for ever stedsast stand, And there for ever stedsast stand. ^
And there fore- uer steadfast stand. ^ And there for ever steadfast stand. ^ And
there for ever steadfast stand. ^

Lovely peace, spring of in- crease, Shall like a precious gemme a- dorne thy.
^ Royal Dia- deem, a- dorne thy Royal Diadem. ^ A- dorne thy Royal Diadem.
^ A- dorne thy Royal Diadem. ^ A- dorne thy Roy- all Di-ademe. ^

^ Love, that binds loyal minds, Shall make all hearts a- gree, To magni-
fie thy ^ state and thee. To magni- fie thy state and thee. ^ To magni- fie thy
state and thee. ^ To magni- fie thy state and thee. ^ To magni- fie thy state
and thee. ^

^ Honor, that proceeds out of noble deeds, shall wait on thee alone, And
cast a sacred ^ light a- about thy Throne. And cast a sacred light about thy
Throne. ^ And cast a sacred light about thy Throne. ^ And cast a sacred light
about thy Throne. ^ And cast a sacred light about thy Throne. ^

^ LOng shall thy three Crowns remain, Blessed in thy long-liu'd reign. Thy
age shall ^ (...) youth appear, And perpetual Roses bear. And perpetual
Roses bear. ^ And perpetual Roses bear. ^ And perpetual Roses bear. ^ And
per- petuall Roses bear. ^

^ MA- ny on earth thy days shall be, But endless thy post- ri- tie, And
matchless ^ thy posteri- tie. And matchless thy posterity. ^ And matchless
thy posterity. ^ And matchless thy posteri- tie. ^ And matchless thy
posterity. ^

^ TRuth; Peace, Love, Honor, and Long-life attend Thee, and all those that
from thy ^ loins descend; With us the Angels in this Chorus meet. So humbly
prostrate at thy sacred feet, Our nightly ^ sports and prophesies we end.

IX.
The Farewell Song.
^ O Stay! sweet is the least delay, When parting forces mourning. ^ Oh Joy!
too soon thy flowers de- cay: From Rose to Bryer retur- ning. ^ Bright beams
that now shine here, when you are parted, All will be dim, all will be dumb,
and ^ every breast sad hear- ted. Yet more, for true love may presume, if it
exceed not ^ measure. O Grief! that blessed hours soon consume, But ioylesse
pass at lea. sure. ^

^ Since we this light must loose, our love expressing: Far may it shine,
Long may it live, to all a ^ public bles- sing, to all a public bles- sing.
^

O stay! sweet is the least delay,
When parting forces mourning:
O Joy! too soon thy flowers decay.
From Rose to Bryer returning.
Bright beams that now shine here,
When you are parted,
All will be dim, all will be dumb,
And every breast sad hearted.
2.
Yet more, for true love may presume,
If it exceed not measure.
O grief! that blessed hours soon consume,
But ioylesse pass at leisure.
Since we this light must lose,
Our love expressing:
Far may it shine, long may it live,
To all a public blessing.
X.
The Lords welcome, sung before the Kings Goodnight.
^ WElcome is the word, The best love can af- ford: For what can better be? ^
Welcome Lords, the time draws near, When each one shall embrace his dear,
And view the ^ face he longs to see. Absence makes the hour more sweet, When
divided lovers meet. ^

Welcome once again,
Though too much were in vain:
Yet how can love exceed?
Princely Guests we wish there were
Jove's Nectar and Ambrosia here,
That you might like immortals feed;
Changing shapes like full-fed Jove;
In the sweet pursuit of love.
FINIS.
