An epistle of ye famous doctor Erasmus of Roterdam / unto the reverend
father and excellent prince / Christofer bishop of Basyle / concerning the
forbedynge of eating of flesh / and like constitutyons of men. etc.

To the most reverend father and lord / lord Christopher bishop of Basyle /
Erasmus of Roterdame wyssheth health.
I Can scarce exp^sse with words most reuere^de p^late / how yuel this
trouble and wra^glyng strife does vex and grieve my mind / now of late raised
up (I know not by what persons) in this noble city / which at my co^my^ng
hither / I found very qiete and pesable. We read / how in ye old time a
strange Bore sent in by Diana / brought great trouble to the people of the
country / called Calydon / But this business and trouble (as I here say) was
brought in to us by an household pigge. The thing of it self (I mean to ete
flessh in lent) it not da^pnable I dare well say / but yet that stubburn and
disobedient mind / seems to be ready and prepayred to any manner of mischefe /
if the truth be so / as I am informed / by the communication of many men

We read in the histories of ye (...) / yt the rulers and heed officers did
punysshe a certain boy / whose play and pastyme was / to prick out the eyes of
birds / where so ever he mizt catch the^. Because that by this froward
appetite and sust of it self to do a mysse / they gessed that he would prove a
mischeuous citezin and a cruel / ready to muder and kyss. We read also that a
certain other man was merced i^ a great so^me of money / because when the
officer after the manner of the country asked of him / whether he had a wife
according to his own mind / and such one as he would have her to be: he
answered bourdi^gly. ye truly have I / but by god not according to thy mind /
and such one as thou would her to be. If one co^ panion had made this answer
to a another in time of recreation / it had been a pleasant and a merry jest / but
by cause it was spoken out of season / neither in mete place / neither to
person according: it did declare and utter a leude mind / little regarding or
setting by ye authorite of the common offycer and ruler. Therefore deserved
punysshme^t / not the saying it self / but the cyrcu^staunce and manner of the
saying. Custom confermed with long use / is a very mighty and strong thing /
which though it be never so (...) and unreasonable / yet after it has ones
taken place and has caught authorite / uneath it can be broken without great
troubli^g of the co^my naltie / neither commonly can it otherwise be put down
/ than by little and little after ye same manner as it crope in at the beginning.
Now fasting and choice of meats are of such nature / that if a man use
them right / they are helping to good lyueng. First soberness and temperaunce
of meat / makes ye mind more free and at liberty / to give atte^daunce to
such studies / which helps more nere to virtue and parfyte lyueng. Moreover
as ye body was a minister and a prouoker unto the misdeeds when we did sin /
and a felo we or pertaker of ye wicked plea sure: so it is mete and according
that in repentance he should be perttaker of sorrow and pain / and be
obedient and do service unto the soul / returni^ge to the right way again.
Fasting therefore and the choice of metes / are good for two purposes. First
to tame the wanto^nes of ye body / yt he be not wild and sturdy against ye
spyrite: For as prouander is taken away from feers horses / and which be
disobedient to the ryder / and to them instead of bread or otes is given hayes
So it is very well done / that norisshynge meat be withdrawn from the body /
which rebelleth against yt spirit / by the reason of abundau^ce of iuce and
rank humors: and that su che kind of metes be ministered un to it / whereof it
should kick and winch as little as were possible against ye mind: which is
as a horsman or ryder to the body. For as meat taken away from ye body
mynissheth the rankness thereof / so are there certain meats which so does
noryssh the body that he shall live but not to rank or wanton. Moreover it is
good and profitable to pease ye wrath of god / provoked with our synful deeds:
For verily when he sees us to punyssh our sesues / he than remytteth his
vengeance. No pain is more nere apertaynyng to every man than when both ye
mind is vexed with the hatered of sin committed and the body also punysshed
with the abstyne^ce of things plesaunt and desectable. And verily this way and
mean to appease the wrath of god / is showed to us in very many places of the
old Testament: And Christ him self taught / that there is a certain kind of
deuyls / which is not cast out / but by prayer and fasting. And though it
were showed before of the prophets also / that the fcstes of the new Moan /
the sabbot days the fastes / the choice of meats / and su the other shadows
of the old law should vanissh a way / when ye sight of the gospel began ones
to shine: yet for all that the church of Christ being yet but young and new
begonnen / and al togider brethyng nothing else / but the new Must of ye
Euangesycal spirit / after that her spouse was taken up i to heuyn / embraced
nothing more nor sooner / than fasting and prayer. And tha^ every man fasted /
and that daily / though they were not compelled thereto / by any commandment
or law. And ye most part of christen men / not only for beryng flesh / but
also refrayning from the eating of fyssh / and all other things which so ever
bare syfe / ly ued content with fruit / herbs / and rotes: When Christ and his
apostels had given leave and liberty to every man for to eat what so ever
metes he (...) / at last when the custom of fasting was ones received and
approved of the common people / in that no man grudged against it / than was
it co^fyrmed first by ye authorite of other bysshoppes / and anon as ter by the
authorite of the pope or bishop of Rome: Because than (as I wene) the
charity of ye people waxing cold / the most part did embrace and love
carnalyte and worldly pleasure. The auctorite and commandment therefore of the
bisshops was added and put to / as a spore to prick forward ye minds of weke
persons / which than were falling to worse things. Than was put to also ye
co^stitution and law written / to restrayn ouermoch liberty / as it were with
certain graces / and to keep the people within their bonds / that they should
not run to far at large / and give them selves to all manner sin and
mischefe. Fasting therefore and the ab stine^ce from certain kinds of metes /
can not utterly be conde^pned of this cause that they do not profit and help
any thing at al unto good living / if they be used so as they ought to be.
Moreover an order is a great thing / without the which there can be no sure and
steadfast peace and co^corde among men, Concord is norisshed and maynteyned
either by equa lyte or else by an order / that it to say when every man has his
room a cordynge to his degree / and every one has his office assigned and
given un to him / as (for an example in the body of man) between the two hands
the eyes / the feet / the ears / there is equalyte: but between the eyes and
the belly / and the fete not equalyte / but order norissheth co^corde / which
ones taken away / what good thing I be seche you is left among christen men
which are (as Paul techeth) ye me^ (...) of one body. Who so ever therefore
troubles the order in a common welthe / brings in no little or small
inco^modyte there unto / namely if he do it not by occasyon or necessytie / but
by a presu^ptuous stubbernes and self mind. ye / and though it be but in
trifels and such things / which of their own nature though they were
dyspised it is no hurt or yuel at al.

As (for an ensample) it is customa bly used in the church / that Alleluia is
not song in the lent / yet to laud and praise god at what soever time or
season it be done / is a virtuous and holy thing / and the church instead of
alleluya has apoi^ted other words / almost of the same strength and
sygnification. yet nevertheless / if any curate i^dispyte of the common custom /
would in his church sing alleluya / and mock or scorn other yt did not so to
/ should he not seem by the judgment of al men / to commit and do a thing
worthy of great punysh meant? Or if any curate in the later end of lent / not
by error or mistaking / but of set purpose and for the nones / did
command in his church the belles to be rong / when it is used of custom to
call the people together with wodden clappers: should he not seem worthy to be
banysshed as a mad man? Some man will say / what trespass or faut has he made?
In the thing of it self is no harm not offense / I grant but in the
dispisyng of ye common custom / and in troublynge the order of things / is
great hurt and offense. and so much the more unworthy of par don and
forgyuenesse / is the malycious mind of the trespasser / because he might have
observed and kept the common custom / without a ny inco^moditie. How much
more is the same thing to be thought and iuged in this matter? I mean of
fasting / whose ensample sprange to us from the prophets / from Johan Baptist
/ from Christ and his apostels which has been commended to us by a long usage
and custom of our elders in times paste. Which thing also is of great
strength / and chefely helps to apease god when he is of fended with our
misdeeds / and to prepayre the sperite to the word of god / to holy prayers /
to godly hymns / and to other virtuous and godly studies and exercises / mete
for a true christen man. But if any thing were received by use and custom /
which for certain co^sideratio^s or some inco^ue nie^ce yt sprung of it / or
for some bet ter purpose / were better to be put down and laid away. It
should be co^ uenie^t and acording / that it were done so by little and little /
that al wra^gling and strife might be excluded.

Christ / although he would ye the shadows of the law of Moses should give
place to the light of the gospel / when it should appear and be showed. Yet
lest he should give occa syon to any man for to be offended / he left none at
al of those things undone / which the law commanded to be done. Neither
taught he openly at any (...) ceremonies to be dispysed / which the jews
observed more relygiously / than yt they could suffer them to be condemned. No
/ neither condemned he vncurtesly those tryflyng tradicions which the Pha rises
of their own inue^tyon added to the burthayns of the law.

This thing only he did rebuke / that the pharyses them selves kept not their
own constytutions / where with they laded and ouerlayde the people / and that
through the supersticion of them / they brake the earnest and sad precepts
of the law. Neither did he so defend his disciples that he said it was
laufull for every manner of cause to break the sabbot day / but he excuses them
by necessytie co^straynynge them / and defends their innocence / by the
ensample of Dauyd and the priests / though upon ye sabbot day (hungre
co^pessynge them) they gathered the ears of corn. Moreover Paul him self /
which most ferue^tly and styffely defends and main tayneth the liberty of
the gospel / a mong ye jews was made as a jew shauynge of his here of his
heed / receyuyng a vow on him self / obser uyng the ceremonies belongyng to
their sacrifyce / and purifyeng him self with other in the temple.

The same Paul / though he knew that an ydole is nothing / and that the
flesh offered to an ydole is nothing more unlawful of it self / tha^ other
flesh: yet had he lever never to eat flesh whiles he lived / than to (...)
occasyon to his weak brother for to be offended by the reason of his etyng. He
had lever for a season to apply him self to the superstytion of the jews /
which could not be ouercomen / than by turnyng the hertes and minds of them
which were (...) against him / to have hyndred the going forward of the
gospel. He had leauer forbear for ever the eating of flesh / than that they
which were weak and scrupulous in conscience / should have had any occasyon
given of him / to suspecte that he was consentyng to the wicked supersticion of
ydolatrers.

The same Paul wylleth also / yt a bond servant / being a christen man /
should be obedient to his lord and master / though he were an infydele / ye /
and waywarde and diverse to please. He wylleth also / that the wife being a
christen woman / be obedient to her husband / though he be a hethen man: He
wylleth / that christen men should content and please the officers which were
gentyls in all things / whether they required toll / trybute / or honor /
lest any man might have had occasyon to be offended with the gospel / which
no doubt they should have had / if ye professyon of Christ should have se med
sedicious and cause of debate and strife. Paul knew well enough / what is the
liberty of the gospel / but it was expedient for the fortherau^ce of the
gospel that knowledge should be subdewed / and give place to charity. For
these men also (I mean the eaters of flesh in lent) as I here say / lays
for them self the liberty of the gospel / of the which they make Luther
renewer and defender. In whom it seems to me / not only the true spirit of
the gos pel to be wantyng / which is sobre / mylde / and endewed with discrete
sym plicite / but also natural wysedom / if they do not favor Luthers cause
than they work wisely / but if they do sauer it / they could not by any other
way have hurt or hyndred it more / than by this. If their entente be / that
the christen people should be restored again to their old lyberte than take
they the wrong way to the wodde / and done al amysse. For their indiscreet
presu^ption does nothing else / but double the yoke and bondage / co^pellyng the
rulers and officers to en crease the bondage with sharp and strayte
commandments and decrees. But these men which defends the^ selves with
the color of the lyberte of the gospel / ought first to do such deeds / for
love of ye which they (...) be perdoned and holden excused / if they did little
regard these things / as be ynge smaller and of less value. Who so ever does
all that he can to help his neighbor: Who so ever (...) so mo che reue^geth
not the injuries and wro^ges done unto him / that he is ready to do a good turn
for an yuel: Who so ever is always sobre / as though he fasted: Whose mind /
rayme^t / and communication shows nothing else but signs of chastity: Who so
ever is altogider busyed and occupied in do yng such things / whereof it
seems that some great and common wealth and profit shall follow: such a man pa
raue^ture shall be perdoned / though he seem less superstitious in obseruyng the
ceremonys which are more mete and according for the unlearned and weak persons.
But whose so ever hole life serves but unto riote and voluptuousness: whose
co^munica tion is proud / seers / and unchaste: Whose mind in so much is not
me ke and mylde / that they be ready for the leest word of reprefe in the
world / to lay on with their fiftes / or to thrust in with their dagger: such
fellows are shameless / if they preach of the lyberte of the gospel / for
asmoch as they are such manner men / yt they ou ght to be kept under and holden
i^ yet / with laws and cerimonys / as it were with grates of iron / even like
as ye jews were / until they do profit and grow up to ye quickness and
strength of the Euangelycal spirit. Wherefore even as ye presu^p tuousnesse of
these men / not without cause displeseth and mislyketh al good and wise me^ /
So are there certain things / in whi che the same men are sorye to se the
flock of Crist ouermoch wrapped and enta^gled with iudaical ceremonies / and
to be oppressed outher with the aucthorite / or else through the neglyge^ce of
some certain prelates of the church. Of the which thing saint Augustyne also
co^playneth in his epystels / cryeng out that the con dytion and state of the
jews were almost more easy and tolerable tha^ the condition of christen men.
So much of iudaical superstitions even at that time was flowen so ple^tuously
in to the common usage and custom of christen men. The people them self
commonly sechen and drawn such bondage unto the^ selves / even likewise as
the wind Cecias draws clouds unto him self (as it is said in the common
proverb) But it were ye bysshopes part and duty to provide and se for the
lyberte of their flock / which they have taken and received of Christ and his
apostels. Now a days we do heap oftentimes but then upon burden / and tie
snare to snare / so little we go about to rydde out of bondage the souls of ye
people / and al to the intent to have them more thral and in danger to our
tyranny / sekyng rather and so following our own sucre and aduau^tage / than
the health and sauegarde of their souls.

Paul puts no difference between one day and another / but he cou^ teth
every day for an holy day / neither iugeth he any work unlawful to be done on
the holy day / which is done according to the charity of the gospel. After that
our elders wylled for a very reasonable cause truly / the sunday to be kept
holyday / in which the people should come togider to here the gospel of god
preached.

Anon after holidays were commanded to be kept from al manner bodily
occupation and labor / when other whiles it were a more holy thy ge with handy
labor to make prouisyon for their wives and childer / be yng in ieoperdy to
perysshe for hu^gre than to here the songs of ye priests in the church /
which they vndersta^ de not: I speak not this by cause I do judge the custom of
antems and hymns to be conde^pned / wherewith the quere gives praise to their
god and ours: but likewise as Christ does teach in the gospel / that man was
not made because of ye sabbot day / but that contrariwyse / the sabbot day was
instytute and ordained for man's cause. So I do judge / yt al ceremonies ought
to give place so often / as the necessyte of our neighbor requires the office
and deed of charity. But the people / of who^ they ought to learn the truth of
these things of the same / are compelled oftentimes to do ye contrary. And it
was not thought suffycient that the people afterward was ouercharged with
holidays / and daily is charged more and more. For in some countries it is i^
manner a common custom / that every bishop does add one new holy day to the
old / as a thing to cause him specially to be remembered perpetually after his
decesse: and that is done otherwhyles for very light causes. One there is
paradue^ture / which i^ times past has had a we^che to his derling / whose
name was Barbara / for this cause he will that saint Barbaras day be holy day.
Another mother was named Katherin / this has seemed to be cause suffycient
wherefore saint Katheri^s day should be holyday / and keep ye peo ple from their
work. Some others name is Wyllyam / and therefore labou reth he all that he can
/ yt saint wyllyam may have his holiday by him self. Let these things be
rehearsed because of example only / for I had lever use feigned examples than to
of fend auy person. Some men also has their private and peculyer affecty ons:
one man toward saint Eras mus / another toward saint Christofer. There is also
certain common affections of orders / of nations / and of cities / as ye black
freers favors excedi^gly their Domynike / the gray freers their Frances: ye
paynters saint Luke / surgions and phisycions Cosme and Domian / shoma kers /
Crispyne: Warryers saint Martyn: french men Claudius: pa risyans Genouese:
Oxforde men saint Friswyde. Of this kind is also ye affection of them / which
will have Christ and the saints to be supersticiously honored by pertes / to
whom it is not enough yt the death of Crist is so often rep^sented and daily
remembered in so mauy masses / and that ye ho ly cross has his two holidays /
ex cepte also the blood which Christ shed forth / the which they say is
kept i^ many places: except ye nay les / yt crown of thorns / ye / except
the prepuce of Christ / that is to wete (the skin which was cut from his
privy me^bres when he was circumcised) which the worship i^ some place:
Except our ladies milk / which is showed in many places / ha ue each one
their proper holyday.

But if any of such manner things shall be / which shall seem that it may be well
and holyly honored: It were enough that holy day were solemly kept in ye
churches only / to which it might be lauful for rich men to come / or who so
ever else might con uenie^tly / and let not the poor men be compelled / whose
hands norissheth a great household. And though these affections paraue^ture
are not to be repreued / yet ought not the wysdom of the bishops to set so
much by them / that forth with every saint and every relyke should have his
proper holyday / his proper mass / and proper service / and peculyare manner of
worshippyng. What other thing is this than to drive and co^pel the poor people
to famysshing / when that thing is taken from them / wherewith only they
norisshe their household or meyny. ye / moreover as the world goth now a
days / what other thing is it else / than to provoke and call ye peo ple from
honest and holy labors / to ydelnesse and ryotte? For what days do we sin
more in excess / dronknesse / lechery / at cards / dyce / kels / and such
unlawful games: in chidyng braulynge / quarellyng / fighting / and murder /
than on the holy days? And of how folysshe judgment and clean out of order are
we here in this thing? If any man on the holyday be dronken from morn to
night: if he have cleued to an hoore: if he have used unlawful games / no man
puts him to any busynes or trou ble: if he have sowed but a shoe / he is
accused as an heretyke. I say not these things because I would that the lay
people should dispyse the holidays / but because me thinks / that the
sheperdes of the church should do very well / if they utterly did put down
such manner halydayes / the sunday only excepted / and a few other pri^cipal
days / and if in the same which they leave vnput down / they did suffer ye
pore people after mass and the preaching / if need required with their work
and labor / to sucour their children and household (...) tes / or else to get
somewhat besides that / to besto we upon poor folk. But now oftentimes / when
after an hole monehes rain / fortuneth one fair day: the husband man is
compelled to suffer his corn which is field or cut down / to lie and rote
in the feldes / which in that same fair day he might have carried in to his
barn / and that because of such holy days / which were never made by the
auctorite of the old fathers / but brought in (to say no worse / nor to go any
nerer the truth) by ye carnal affections of certain men. These things at the
first beginning crepe in by little and little / under the color or apparau^ce
of honesty and virtue. Afterward they spring and flowen in more plentuously.
At the last / when they be ones co^fyrmed and stre^thed by usage and custom /
they reign and occupyen tyranny / so that than they can not scarcely be laid
down or taken away / without great trou ble and much strife. Wherefore the
bishops ought not to look beside these things / but dilygently and straightly
to look upon them at their first comi^g in / for generally what so ever
partayneth to the laws of man / are as remedies or salues unto sycknesses or
sores: and even so are they to be atte^pred and applied to the present state of
times and things. There be many things / which in old time it was a good
and godly thing to instytute and ordeyn / which self same (...) ges
afterward for some occasyon spronge up / and for the qualyte of times and of
men's manners changed / to be abrogated and dysanulled / were a more godly
thing: which thing for all that ought not to be done / by the rasshe
presu^ption of the people / but by the auctoryte of the rulers / that al
sedition and strife might be avoided / and the common custom so changed /
that unity and co^corde were not broken / which thing lest it mizt happen /
prouisyon is to be made by the delyge^ce of the bishops / whom it is not mete
any longer to stop their ears and to wexe (...) / at ye just and rightful
co^playntes of the people: Paraue^ture the same judgment is to be given of ye
wedlock of prestes. In the old time / as prestes were very few in nombre: so
were they very holy in their living. The same that they might the more freely
give atte^daunce to holy excercises and pastymes / wyllyng without any co^
pulsyon / kept them selfs chaste. And verily / so great love of chastity was
among the fathers in ye old time / that certain of the^ were loathe to suffer
any christen man to mary a wife / if he had been unmarried at the time of his
baptyme: And much more loathe were they to suffer any to mary the second wife.
Than that thing which seemed co^menda use and alowable in bisshops and priests
was translated unto the deacons / and at the last to subdeacons also. The
custom wyllyngly received / was in conclusyon confyrmed and stablysshed by the
authorite of the bysshoppes. In the mean time the no^bre of priests increased
and the holy lyueng of them decreased. How many swarms of priests are
notysshed in monasteries? how many in colages? and besides these there is an
innumerable multitude of p^stes eueri where. And among so ma ny / ho we great
scarceness is there of them which lives chastely? I speak of them which
keeps concubynes openly at home in the stead of wives for I do not no we
touch nor medel with the mysteries of ye more secret pleasures of the
flesh. I do speak of those things only / which be openly known to ye
common people. And though we do know these things well enough / yet are we in
admytti^ge and receyuyng them to holy orders very easy / and in the releasyng
of the co^stitution / which forbyddeth priests to have wives / very hard and
strayte / when Paul teaches clean contrariwise / that no man is swiftly to be
promoted to holy orders / and in many places / dilygently prescribes and
apoynteth what manner men p^stes ought to be / what manner men deacons: but as
concerning lyueng sole without wives / neither Christ neither the apostels
have appointed or set any law in holy scripture / watchyng all the night long
at the toumbes of martyrs / which was in the old time received and used by the
common custom of christen men / and that certain hundred years did continue /
the church has put down many days ago. Fasting wont to be prolo^ged and
contynewed until eui^ tide / the church has translated to noon. And many
other things for necessary causes rissen and sprung up the church has
changed. Why do we here cleue fast so obstynately to the co^stytution of man
/ namely seeing that so many causes does requere a change. For first a great
part of the priests lives with yuel fame / and with very vnquyete conscience
entreat they and deals with the holy mysteries. Furthermore / a great perte
of the fruit which should spring and rise of the^ peryssheth / because their
doctrine is dispysed of ye people / for their open shameful lyueng. But if to
them which can not live chaste license were granted to mary wives: both they
should live more qui etely / and with authorite should preche the word of god
/ the people regarding their doctryn: and they shlude provide dilygently that
their children were brought up honestly / and in lernyng: neither the one sort
of them should be shame and rebuke to ye other

I speak not these things because I couete or entende to be a capitayn or a
defender to those priests / which now of late without the authorite of ye
bishops / has begone to be married men having wives / but to exhort the
governors of ye church and put them in remembrance to co^sy der and ponder
well / whether it be expe dient that the old constitution were applied to the
profit of ye time that now is. In ye mean season I would also that the
bishops were put i^ remembrance / not to receive so rassh ly without
probation / who so ever wol come unto the order of priests Likewise I think
that other are to be warned / that they examyne their own selves dilyge^tly /
whether they were able and mete to execute ye office which they do take upon
them and that they take not upon them selves the charge and burden of so great
a persession for cause of lucre / or because they would live ydely and in ease
/ pur chasyng both dampnation to their own souls / and rebuke and shame / or
sclau^der to the church. Moreover / who so ever are consecrated and made
priests al ready / although the bissho pes did open the way to matrymony / yet
I would advise and counsel them / yt they do not entangle the^ sell ues
suddenly and without aduyseme^t with wedlock / lest it might fortune them to
be vexed with double repen tau^ce / that is / both of preesthod and of marriage.
It is a great part of chastity / a man to be willing with all his heart and
mind to be chaste. There is nothing more to be wysshed and desired / than that a
priest without co^brau^ce of matrymony / at lyberte / and hole / do serve his
lord god. But if when al remedies has been assayde non can help / neither the
rebellyon of the flesh can be overcome / than it remains that he live
chastely with one woman / having a wife for a remedy and not for voluptuous
pleasure / enforcyng him self in the mean season to the uttermost of his power
/ to recompense and make amends for the infirmyte of the flesh / with other
virtuous lyueng and holy studies and works / for so shall al men perceive that
a wife was sought sor necessyce / and not for voluptuousnes.

And I doubt not / but yt the most part of the bysshoppes parceyueth right
well that these things ar even so as I do say: but I fear lest in this thing
also / lucre does withstand and be a lettynge / that we may not follow that
thing / which we do se and perceive to be best: If the bysshoppes would go
about to change the co^stitution / their officers i^ their courts parauenture
would grudge and cry against it / which feleth more profit and auau^tage to
grow of priests concubynes / than would grow of their wives. But it is
agayust right and reason / yt lure should bear so great a swing among us / yt
for it we should not judge indyffere^tly and make just prouisyon for Christ's
ministers / in a matter of so great weight and value. There are many other
things of this kind or sort / but let these two before rehearsed / be put
for cause of example.

Now I return again to speak of fasting / if any man be so stro^ ge that he
can mesure and tempre him self by contynuall sobreuesse: this man has no
great need of fasting commanded / except for a season the wrath of god were
to be peesed with such manner sacrifice. But you will say: certain days of
fasting are appointed and commanded for the rude and unlearned persons. I am
well co^ tents let that be counted tolerable. But they command and apoynt
(...) one refection or meal in ye day / they do assygne also what kind of
meats we shall use. Neither they think this enough / but they thretten
moreover everlasting damnation / to who so ever shall break the custom brought
in by men. For after such manner and facion / certain curates does denou^ce and
command the fasting days to the people: I wot not whether they do it
according to the minds and wylles of the bishops / or else no. Neither yet
think they all this sufficient / but besides this they draw and hale to
punysshme^t / as it were one that had slain his own father: who so ever has
tasted of a pigges flesh instead of fyssh mete. I said at the begynni^ge /
that disobedience and sedicious presu^ption is worthy eueriwhere of great
punysshme^t. Neither do I plead any such manner of cause / or defend them
which are begynners of debate or strife: but yet nevertheless / me seems that
this judgment is not only vnge^tel / but al so folysshe and out of order.
First fasting was commanded: this was the chief and pri^cipal point of the
matter. To eat such and such meats / was but an accessorie or seco^dary
thing / Now they suppe eueriwhere generally on ye fasting days / and no man
is grieved with it / neither makes any great matter thereof / but if any man have
tasted any flesh / every man cries out and wo^dreth / as though heaven /
earth / and see / and al should go to gider / saying / the state of ye church
is decade and like to fall / heresies increases and ryseth a flote: To suppe
no man needs any pardon. That it may be lauful to eat flessh or eggs / a
pardon or dispensation must be bought of the pope of Rome.

So that thing which draws more nere in lyknesse to the supersti tion of
the ceremonies of the jews law / and which is al together such ma ner a thing
/ that a man might worcester thely marueyle / that it has been so greatly received
and used of us christen men / which do defye and abhor (...) / and other
ceremonies of the jews (I mean choice of metes) We do greatly set by /
defendyng it stiffely with tothe and nail. And fasting / which is a thing
more agree ynge with the doctrine of Christ / and which helps more to the
exercises of true virtue and holiness / we suffer to be abolysshed and wear
out of use: For albeit that prayer is the sa crifyce properly belo^gynge to
christen men: whose fellow and companion is fasting / because these two /
prayer and fasting / both in the gospels and also in the epistels of ye
apostels / almost always are coupled together (for by fasting the mind is
pourged and strengthed / that the prayer might be pure / fervent / and lusty)
yet in ye choice of meats / we hold faster the co^stitution of man / and more
toughlye do cleue unto it / than in fasting: how be it the christen men are
also charged and laden with more often fastes / than ever were the jews. Of
the kinds of meats / Christ him self said: What so ever gothe in at the
mouth / defyleth not the man. And Paul not disagreyng from his master /
says: that ye kingdom of god is not mete and drike. But in ye choice of meats
/ how much more grievous and paynful is our burden / tha^ was the jews? for
unto the^ it was lauful to eat every kind of fyfsh / of al manner four foted
beestes / of al manner fowls / the best and most hol somest. To us it is
forbidden to ete any manner flesh at al / for a great perte of the year. And
consider I pray you / ho we curious has been in this thing / either the
custom or else the authorite of our elders. At certain times nothige is
forbidden but one ly the eating of flesh: sometime it is lauful to eat both
the oumbles and the satte: at another time but only the fat or brewes: at
another time it is not lauful to taste any perte either of foul or else of be
living on the earth. And here also ryseth ve ry many questions / ho we far
the signification of this word flesh / does stretch or reche: for there be
certain beestes belo^gyng to ye see / not unlike to the beestes lyueng on the
earth: as Porpasses / seals / dogs and certain lives both on ye land and
i^ the water / sometime in the one and sometime in the other / as castor an
otter. Moreover they dispute about cocles / snayles / and frogs / when there
they be flesh or not. Again some days / it is permytted and unlawful to
eat eggs / butter / chese / milk: Another time / butter / milk / and chese
/ but not eggs. There be certain days in which it is not lauful to touch
any of these things at (...). There be some days also / i^ whi che it is
forbidden to eat what so ever has ones bron life: so ye no we it is a great
doubt / whether it be lau full to eat spo^ges / which (as Aristotel iugeth)
has felyng / and be sensyble creatures: and there be some men which byndeth
them selves / to fast to breed and water only. Though we do grant yt these
things are not to be dispysed / (...) who sees not / how cold things they
are / and very tryfels / if they be compared to the precep tes of the gospel /
whereupon we ought chefely and pri^cipally to set our care and thought.
Moreover it is to be co^sydred / whether to exact these things of al men / so
straightly and so ri gorously does agree to the liberty of the gospel / which
Paul so (...) defends. Now let us se how true it is even in this thin
ge also / that which Paul says.

Bodily exercitation is profitable but for little / good lyueng or in ward
holiness is profitable to al things. No days has the cokes more business
and labor in the kechyns / than on the fysshe days / neither at any time is
there more ordinance or greatter cost made to fare well.

So it is brought to pass / that the poor men be hu^gry / and the rich men
lives more desycately. Who had not leauer eat Sturgion / trout / or lamprey:
tha^ bacon hardened with smoke / or tough mutton? And among these things also
/ which are not flesh / there be many things which are more norisshynge
than befe or mutton: as whelkes / coccles and other things many. ye / and
provoke and styreth more to lust of flesshely pleasure. And a man (...) find
certain things that does ye same even among herbs and fruits of trees also.
What avails it to abstain from mutton / if thou (...) thy belly with rocket /
dates / fygges / and (...) / musshernes / artickchouhges / and such other
things / which kyndleth the genitales more with wa^ton lust than hens or
pullettes? Sucket makes the body more strong and lusty than befe does: and
yet non of all these things is forbidden. By this means it is brought to
pass / that they which be poor and of small substance / be grieved and payned
with such co^stitutions wha^ they have lest need: and the rich men through
occasyon are called and provoked to more pleasures and deyntie fare: Some me^
wys say. This is caused through our own fault / I grant: And there fore
parauenture ought such things to be taken away / when we pceyue more hurt
tha^ good to grow of them. And it seems not very mo the more fruit to come of
fasting / for they which be poor or weak of body / are fore grieved with long
fasting. On ye othersyde / they which be strong and have where with /
vitayleth them selves and fylleth their belly with that / which were suffycie^t
for three days / so that after dinner they are mete for nothing / but only to
sleep. And yet fasting is ordained to be used for this cause most chesely /
that the spirit should be the less co^bred or hold down with ye weight or
burden of the body. What needs it here to rehearse diverse diseases and
sicknesses / ye weakness of old men and young children / poverty / and the
certain peculyar nature and complexion of bodies / so that to some men the
fasting of a sewe hours is death ye / when they be hole / and to some al manner
fysshe is as a Scorpion or a snake / or any venomous be is to other.
Moreover in such countries where is great scarceness or lack of fyssh / to
forbydde ye eating of flessh What other thing is it / than to com mau^de the
people to famysshe them selves? In so great dyuersyte and inequalite / than of
regions / of bodies / of co^plexions / of ages: It appears evidently enough /
how many be gre ued with the law / which (as they wene) is equale and
indifferent to all men. There be some bodies which will be in good plyte / ye
/ and rank and wanton though they were fed (...) hay. Again some there be /
which scarsly are kept a live / though they be fcdde with partriches and
fesau^tes. If the decree did command / that in these fasting days / the
rich men should use te^peraunce and measure in their fare / and that which
they withdraw from their own tables of their wont fare / to be sent to poor
folk for their refresshynge: than should there be made equalyte / and the
co^stytution should favor somewhat of Christ's gospel. Now is that fulfilled
and done eueriwhere / which Paul said, One is hungry / and ano there is
dronken or to full. The change of meats is apleasure to ye rich men / and a
remedy against lothsomnesse or gluttyng / neither at any time do they fare
better and feed more dayntilye / than when they abstayn from they eating of
flesh. But in the mean season the pore husband man gnawynge on a raw
pasnyp rote or on a leke / for lack of other sole or cates / eats there with
black breed of the coursest sort that can or may be made. And instead of the
meth / bragot / or ypocras of ye rich men / he (...) sower whay or water of
the podle / having much a do in the mean season to sustain his wife / his
children / and the resydue of his household meyny with co^tynual swette and
labor. Finally the ma ners of men is come to that point now a days / that
these things greueth the^ only / for whose cause they were not so greatly
instytuted and ordained / and does nothing apertayne to them / for whose cause
they were chefely ordained. So^e man will say if any man be grieved or over soore
laden with these things / there is re medy enough / whereby he may be ea sed.
How I pray you? he may pur chase a license to eat flesh of the bishop
of Rome. Thou spekest gayly well. But neither al men have leayser to tonne to
Rome / neither al men have plenty of money / wherewith they might bye such
pardons. And here again / it is comen to pass / yt to rich men (which had
most need to be forbidden the etyng of flesh / and which had most need to
fast) the co^stitution is released al most al together for money / and the
grievous yoke and heavy burden lies only on their necks / which at pore and
socoursesse. Moreover I do maruayle greatly in the mean season at this / that
the authorite to release such manner co^stitutions is re served and left only
to the bishop of Rome / for so thinks the common people. Me seems after
my poor judgment / it were more conuenyent that authorite to dispense with men
for such co^stitutions were given to the curates (which are succeeded in to the
roumes of the bisshops / as co^cer nyng payns and labors: for they may easily
know ye state of every man / the plyte of ye body / the riches or habilyte /
ye / and the very mind al so) Namely seeing these (...) does not so greatly
help to true holiness and virtuous lyueng. To them is committed and betaken
the dyspensation and besto wynge of Christ's gospel: to them is given power to
mynister the sacraments of the church / and authorite to here co^fessyons /
and to assoyle also from grievous sins and enormyties. It is lauful for them /
ye and they must needs / putti^ge their lives in ieoperdy / be present and nere
them which be sick of the pestylence / or else any other sylthy / sti^kyng /
and abhomynable diseases.

Why than is denied to them ye authorite to give license to eat such meats /
which the weakness and feblenesse of some persons requires? If the curate be
unmeet to dyspence these small trisles / certainly than is there great fault in
the bysshoppes / which has committed the flock of Christ to such manner
person. But if the curate be a mete and able person / to whom the greatter and
more weigh ty things also might be committed / it must needs be that here
lies hyd some secret (...) / for whose cau se these smaller and lyghter
things may not be committed to the same person also. But here again me
thi^keth / There the lucre and advantage of certain persons / ready to grudge
and speak against me: And would god that this ca^ker were clean scoured out of
Christ's church / which suffers nothing any where to be pure / holy / and
incorrupt / for ca^cred couytousnesse is the causer that the co^stitutions
ordained as a mean and an help to godly lyueng / are no we welnere nothing
else / but snares and grynnes mete to catch money with all. What avails it
that so many sharp and strayte laws has been made of the election of bisshops
/ ab bottes / and other prelates and rulers of the church: if no we eueri where
for money given / the election is outher corrupted or else excluded. We read
that a tyrant of Sicilya called Dionisyus / gave many laws to his subjects /
and when they were publys shed and commonly known / he wynked or looked beside
the tra^sgressours of them for the nonce / until at the last when no man
regarded them / neither mystrusted any thing / he had a great meyny in danger
of the^. So the laws were to hi as nets / where with he hunted for a pray.
But god forbydde / that Christ's vycars for like purpose / other should charge
or led ye people with new co^stytutio^s or else abuse the decrees of ye old
fathers. Without doubt / need there is of co^stitutyons made by them which are
in authorite. And it chau^ceth oftentpmes / that for certain special causes /
it were expedient and profitable / that the rigor and straightness of the
common saw were released / so that it were not don eueriwhere / nei there for
sylthy lucre of money / neither without discretion or judgment but for a great
wealth and profit.

It should be greatly profitable and appertaynyng unto ye purite of the
doctrine / and lyueng of the church / if no releasyug or dispensatyon of the
law were to be sold / and that power to dispe^ce were committed to the^ / whi
che might know the qualyte and state of the person / which should enjoy the
dispe^sation. Now to obtain dispe^sation / in a manner thou nedest nothing else
/ but to show thy name and pay thy money. If the cause be just and suffycient
/ why is money required? if the cause be not rightful what helps the
dispensatyon? Moreover in some things I might use this reason parauenture / if
the cause be reasonable and laufull / what need is there of a dispe^sation? if
the cause be not honest and riztful / what avails any dispensation? The pope
commands fasting / but (as I wene) his mind and will is not / ye young
children / or very aged psons / sickely persons / or they which are diseased /
should be bound with this law / neither (to speak generally) any such psons
/ which could not fast without their exceeding great hurt. Here than where
is a certain and euydent cause / no need is to release the law / but to
interpret it (...) there. In a doutful cause / who^ should thou (...)
counsel of / rather than of thine own curate / or ye ordinary bishop? If
thou refusest his judgment to whom thou art known / thou vttrest and show
thy corrupt conscience. But if other hatered or ignorance / or else any other
thing does let / that he will not grant the rightful dispe^sation: let
than the way be open to have socour and help of the archbysshop / or the
bishop of Rome. The process self of our disputation moves us and puts
us in remembrance most virtuous father / to consider in few words / how
straitely such co^stitutio^s does bind us / which pertayneth only to man's
law / of the which sort no man will deny the popes decrees to be / which
concerns fasti^g / choice of meats / and the wedlock and marriage of prestes
/ for of other things I dispute not. There is some man which refuses to
socour and help his father / being old / sic ke and nedy / with his riches or
service when he has enough whereof he might do it. The bishop commau^ death
him to socoure his father / teaching and declarynge that honor in the
commandment of god (when he byddeth us honor our father and mother) is
understand socour and help or relefe / and not putting of the cappe or
gyueng place / or goi^ge out of the way. If this man refuse to obey / it is no
doubt but that he makes him self in dan^ger of the fire of hell. Again / if
any man be at debate with his neighbor / and if he which has offended or
hurt the other has repented / desyring forgive nesse and ready to make ame^des
for the injury which he has done: If he which is offended or hurt would re
fuse to obey the bishop / co^maundyng him to remytte the ve^geaunce and to be
at one again with his neighbor: It can not be douted / but that for this
disobedience / he byndeth him self to the fire of hell. Why so? Because this
that the bishop commands / he commands it according to the doctrine of
the gospel / and does rather offer and put to him the co^mau^ dement of Christ
/ than his own commandment. But whether the same thing be done in these
things / whereof we now do speak: let us consider for what so ever I shall say
I will speak it / not as one affyrmyng / but as one inquiryng and searching out
yt truth before yt a bishop / both most virtuous and even so most exellently
learned. This is of surety / that the most part of these things / whereof we
do now speak / came i^ first and were brought up by custom. Now whom custom
does bind / and in (...) things / and how forforth / wha^ and how long:
it where somewhat to long here to discuss. First of al / this thing me seems
might be proved by reason / that a custom bideth no man more straightly / tha^
their mind and will was / which were the begynners and first bryngers up of ye
custom: Let be excepted in ye mean season ye hurtyng of other men's conscience
/ and contempt or dispisynge. It is to be believed / that they which first of
their own free wylles / laid down their substance and riches at ye seete of
the apostels / did it for that purpose / that who so ever would not do (...) /
should be bound to ever lasting pain. Or that they which first began to
abstayn from the eating of flesh / would be the begi^ners of this custom /
with ye mind and will / that who so ever afterwar de would not do the same /
should be bound to everlasting death. Nay / I wene rather yt such was their
mide and such their communication / that if they had seen any man being wea ke
and feeble in body / which provoked by their example / would have enforced to do
the same: they would have mo nysshed and cou^seyled him by these words. Trewly
beloved brother / I which have a body rebellious to the spirit / not without
cause do cha stice and punysshe my flesh with fastes: Thou have a body both
weak and febly / and also obedyent enough to the spirit / whose weakness is
to be cured / rather than wanto^nesse to be kept under and punysshed. Wherefore
provide and se for the health of thy body / taking such meats mesura bly / and
with gyueng tha^ges to god / which are mete for the / that thy body may ye
more lustely and coragiously do service to his spirit. After su che facyon
does Paul counsel his well-beloved Timothe / that he should use a little wine
for the weakness of his stomach / and often sickness and diseases. Now
whether custom / contrary to the will and minds of the^ which have been the
begynners of (...) does bind to any sin (likewise as when any man
monyssheth another of his mysdede / although he do it not for thentent that he
which is monysshed should sin more grievously: yet he which monysshed of his
sin does not repent and amend / synneth more grievously tha^ he did before)
it is not mete time now to discuss. This only is to be consy dred / whether
in these things / which being of them self lauful / are made unlawful /
only by the co^stytution of man: it was the mind and will of the bishops and
popes / when they did co^fyrme the custom received and used / that who so ever
/ not of any malycious co^tempte / but thorough frayltie and negligence did not
observe and kept the custom / should be bound to ye fire of hell. god is not so
cruel or ve^geable / ye for every light fault he will cast them in to hell /
whom he has redeemed with his own blood: He knows the weakness and fraylte of
his creature / and he suffers many things in us / before that he wyllcutte us
away from the body of his own son. But who so ever co^mytteth a deedly sin
/ of the me^ bre of Christ / is made the member of the devil: of the heir of
heavenly life is made yt heir of everlasting fire Seeing than that the bishops
are succeeded in to the room of him / whi che secheth to have all men saved /
and to distroy no man: and if they bear fatherly affection toward their flo
cke / co^sydering also that their selves are men frail and weak / and in many
things nedyng the mercy of god. How is it lykely to be true that they were
of this mind / that they would with their co^stitutions made by them / which
are naught else but men / bind their brethern and sons to everlasting pain?
namely sei^g they may know even by their own minds / that the minds of men
be prone and ready to sin. ye / and oftenty mes are wont to be styred and
provoked to lust of synnyng / so much the more because they are forbidden.

Temporal and lay princes / which bears a sword by their office / and
which with fear and punysshme^tes by their professyon / holds the people
back from ro^nyng to much at large / yet would they not although they might /
the laws which they ordayn and make / to be rigorus / that the transgressour
and breaker of them should forth with lose his heed. And yet can they kylle
nothing else / but the body only. And do the bysshopes / whose part is to save
me^ with the sword of the word of god / for a lytes meat or drink / which
Crist has given us lyberte to take / requere that the breker of their
constitution should go both body and soul in to yt fire of hesle: namely
seeing that it lies in their power / not to cast on this bo^de or snare / nor
to bring men in to this great paryl and icopardy.

Moreover ye bonds of the Eua^ gelical charity / is greter than ye bon des of
kynred: and the bonds of ye spi rite / than the bo^des of the flesh: and the
bonds of god / than of nature. But what carnal father was there ever so cruel
against his sons / ye is he had forbidden them ye dri^kyng of wine / lest at
any time ye dri^kyng immeasurably might cast them selves in to a fever / he
would require / that this his forbyddynge should be of so great strength / that
if they did not obey it / they should suffer death: namely seeing that they
might dri^ke wine safely enough and without any hurt / so they drink it
mesurably.

No doubt of it / he would forbear and refrain from gyueng any such
commandment / if he knew that his sons should be in danger of so great
paryl / and he had lever that they should sal in to some fever / than to run
in to ieoperdy of their life. Be sides this / I do not suppose ye there is any
man but he will grant / that the laws of god which he him self made and
ordained / are more to be re graded and set by / than ye laws made by men: but
not all the laws of the old Testament given of god / did bind in the old
time to deedly syn no / certain of them bound not to any sin at al (if we
give credence to famous dyuines) of the which sort I suppose it was / if any
man had touched carrion of any best whi che was not slavne / but dyed by the
own accord. And shall the bishop which is not the author and (...) / but ye
steward and minister of a more gentyl Testament / require this / that al manner
constytutions of his making should bind his subjects to the pain of
everlasting fire?

I wylcome to the authorite of the apostels / which has always ben so much
regarded and set by / by ye consent of al Christen people. I dare not be bold
to affirm and say plain ly / that what so ever thing they did command they
commanded it / with that mind and will that they would every transgressour
thereof to be bound to the fire of hell. Paul in many places forbids
couytousnesse / lechery / wrath contention / and envy by name / puttyng to
these words. We know / that they which does such things / shall not
possess the king dome of god. And yet the (...) grau^teth and confesses not
every ma ner wrath to be deedly sin / neither paraue^ture al manner of envy.

Again the same Paul straitely commanded / that women should not speak in the
church or company assem bled / lest that sex somewhat proud and high minded /
might challenge to them selves any authorite in the presence of their husbands.
And yet I do not think that he commanded that / being of this mind and will /
ye if any woman through infyrmyte longyng to that sex / had spoken a ny thing
in the congregation for desire to learn / forth with she should be made bond
to ye fire of hell. I put forth these things so / that yet nevertheless it may
be free for every man to judge / as he thinks like. Last of al / paraue^ture
even in the commandments of the gospel also / a man may find certain /
which does not forth with bind every man to deedly sin. We se that ye
fathers os ye orders of relygious men / does openly witness this of their
co^stytutions (which for co^corde and equalyte to be had in their couentes /
they nedefully do add and put to ye co^mau^ deme^tes of ye gospel) that they
will not any person to be bound be them not so much as to venyal sin.

Wherefore by so much the more I do marueyle greatly / that there be certain of
that sort which can suffer rather their brother either to dye / or else to be
veved and tourmented with a disease / which is more grievous tha^ death / than
they would syce^ce him to cate flesh. I will not here rehearse that certain
dyuines and those of the famous sort / has affyrmed plain ly / that no mortal
prelate can bind his subject by his precept to deedly sin / except that
which he co^mau^ death / does depe^de of the law of god which proposition or
saying at this present time / I do neither approve neither disprove. This thing
only I will ask and enquire: whyder al such manner co^stitutions does bind to
everlasting pain / or (...) a certain of them only. If they al do bind to
everlasting pain / tha^ is the yoke of christen men very heavy and grievous /
seeing that there is so many co^stitutions of the bishops / but if certain
only so does bind / I would desire to know / by what mark a man might
dyscerne those which does bind / from those whi che does not bind. You will
say / they do bind when these terms ar put to: We command and charge. etc.
But at Rome every year such manner co^stitutions are made and publys shed new
/ that no spouse shall give to his spousesse any token or gift / above the
valor of. xii. ducates / for let this be put forth bvcause of example. I
demand now / if any man without any masyce or dispite of that co^stitution
did give a token or gift of. xiii. ducates: did he sin deedly? You will
answer (as I trow) it seems no. yet in these and other more lyghter things
also / is added always beside grievous sin the pain of excommunication in the
deed doing. And yet there be dyuynes which says / that no man may be
excommunicate / but only for such a trespass which is deedly sin before god.
But this disputation / whi there the bishop or pope may in all manner things
bind their subjects to deedly sin / I will pass over at this time. This I
will ask and demand / whether it be probable and like to be true / that the
pope were of such a mind / that although he might he would after such manner
charge and lode his subjects. Paul is angry and mysco^tent that any man
iugeth his brother in meat or dri^ke and shall I for meat or dri^ke thrust
down my brother in to hell?

Now what is the mind of the Bysshoppes and popes in other things / let us
leave that vndyscussed at this time. Certaynlye in fasting it is euydente and
open / yt their will was not to bind al men by their precepte and decree.
Wherefore than / do we being cruel iuges against our neighbor / other wise
interpret the popes saw / than according to his own mind. For it is nothing
lykely to be true that his mind and will was to bind any man to fasting or to
etyng of fissh / which could not do it / without the great hynderau^ce and
appeyring of his health / or else ieoperdy of his life. Therefore he byndeth no
young children / not very aged men / not them which be sick / not poor folk
/ and to make an end / not any other persons / which for some other cause can
not away with fasting / and much less he byndeth the^ to abstain from the
eating of flesh. These persons now rehearsed / if they do eat / they seem to
eat by the mind and will of him which was maker of the law. You will say /
but in the mean season yuel occasyon is given to leudly disposed persons /
which under this pretense and color / will eat / wha^ they have no need or
reasonable cause. If this paryl and ieopardy whereof you do speak / were
pertaining to murder or to some other great yuel or mischefe / than would I
hold well with your saying. Now I suppose it might better be suffered / that
six hundred did eat flesh without necessyte / than that one person through
such superstition / should be put in ieoperdy of his life. Wherefore I commend
the manner and custom used in Italy / where even in ye lent season / is sold
openly in the shambles (though of fewer than at other times) both veale / kydde
/ and lamb lest any thing might be wantynge to them which were sick / or
might yuel forbear eating of flesh, Neither any man there notes or
rebukes the byer or eater / although he appears not by any outward tokens /
to be sick or dyseased: for there be many causes which a man can not perceive
by the cou^teuau^ce or face. And it belongs to the charity of christen men to
iugeth best / what so ever may be done well and lausully / dronknesse /
backbytyng fylthy communication / and rebaudrie: does verily declare and she
we a leude person / even according to the rule of the gospel. For these things
which in very deed are yuell things / when they come from the mouth /
declares the fountain of the heart to be corrupt / from whens such stynche
is breathed forth: And yet with such things we be but lightly offended or
grieved. ye otherwhyses we rejoice in them / and commend and allow them. But he
that does eat flesh / we do so defye and abhor / as though he were no
longer a christen man: Natwithstandynge / that the gospel does forbydde to
judge any man in those things / which of the^ sllues are not are not yuel. ye
and Paul also wylleth not any man to be iuged for meat or drink. Therefore
who so ever eats flesh for a great weighty cause / he synneth not at al
against the law / for as much as he has done nothing contrary to the mind
of him / which has made the law. He that eats without necessyte / if he do
a mysse / he trespaseth but only against the law of man. But he that
condemns his brother / he that backbyteth / he that sclau^dreth and defameth
his brother / does sin and trespass / both against the doctrine of the gospel
/ and also against ye precepte of the (...) Paul: And in my judgment does
more grievously sin / than he should / if he did eat flesh hole. x. years
together. They call them Lutherians and heretykes which does eat flesh. Now
this is not the eating of calves flesh / but it is the (...) and eating of
thy brothers flesh. Whether of these two things I beseech you / is the more
grievous offense and synn? And yet at that thing which the authorite of ye
gospel does forbydde / which Paul the apostel also does forbydde / no man is
moved or grieved / at these things which contrary to the doctrine of ye gospel
/ the custom of men has brought in: We do so shyuer and quake / as though the
hole christian relygion should atones go to wrake for ever? But here in the
mean season aryseth two diffyculties or doutes / of the which the one seems
to pertayne to order / ye other concerning the hurtyng or (...) of our
neighbors conscience.

I grant / that an order is greatly to be regarded / in so much that it were
better to suffer even some tyranny or crudesyte / than by troubli^ge the order
/ to make a co^fusyon and a great styrte in the world. And Paul byddeth that
man's company to be eschewed which does live inordinately / troublyng the
common or der. And the same / lest we should gy ue any man occasyon to be
offended / commands us to abstain / not one ly from that thing which is
yuel in deed / but also from al manner thi^ ge / which appears to be yuel. But
that an order may be had and establys shed / and by reason of order
tra^quilytie: It is (...) that the heedes and rulers have their authorite sure
and stable / and that the people obey them non otherwise / than the vycats or
deputies of god. I grant al these things to be very true. And Peter the
apostel condemns them / whi che folo wyng their own sensual ap petites /
dispiseth the common officers and rulers / and such as be set i^ high
authorite: and yet he speaks there / as far as I parceyue / of the heed
officers and princes / which were (...) men and infydels. How much more than
ought the authorite of the bishops to be sure and inuyolate / which if they be
good / they are to be obeyed as the friends of god: but if they be yuel / and
yet does teache those things which be right and good: we ought to obey the
doctrine which they teache. But if they be neither good / nor yet does teache
good things / yet in my judgment they are so^ what to be suffered / left by
troublynge the order of things / gretter inco^uenye^ce and mischefe might
rise. This counsel would I give to the christen people. But if the wickedness
of them should go so farforth / that it were intollera ble both to god and man
(which thig god forbydde ever to come to pass) Christ him self can make such
ma ner scourges and whippes / where with he may drive out of his temple / such
as he list not to be co^uersaunt there. For likewise as not without great
co^syderation and wisdom / the election of ye (...) has been tra^s lated from
the people to a few me^l so I do not hold with it / that ye old examples
should be renewed and brought up again / whereby the common multitude did
expel and put down their bisshops for every litel crime / For we read that
Brice for ye surmyse of fornycation / and unchaste living with his lau^dresse /
was deposed by ye common voice and noise of the people. But as Paul
commands the wives / that in all points they should be obedient to their
husbands / and have them in reverence (...) their lords: And again on the
other perte counsayleth the husbands that they should mesurably and ge^tely
use their authorite toward their wives / re me^bring that they are their
fellows and matches in Christ / and the co^heri tours of the kingdom of heaven /
the one half of them selves / and that (...) should apply them selves to their
in fyrmyte and weakness / with discretion and (...): So in like manner the heedes
and rulers of the church are to be monysshed and counsaysed / that they do not
either abuse their autho rite and power on the people / neither turn the
obedience of the lympse peo ple / in to their own tyranny. They are sheep / but
the sheep of Christ / rather than of the bishops: they are sheep but for those
sheep that highest and heed shepherde has shed his precious blood: they are
sheep / but so derely beloved of their lord / ye wha^ one of them was gone a
straye / he with careful dilyge^ce sought for it / and at the last when he had
found it / he brought it again to his feldes upon his own sholders: They are
sheep / but reasonable sheep / and in this (...) egal and peers to the bishops
ye / sometime also are more (...) than certain of the bishops: and (...) of
these sheep are made pastoure or sheperdes. The people was not or dayned for
cause of the bisshoppes / but the bishops were instytuted and ordained for
cause of the people.

Wherefore albeit that the bishop co^ pared to each one by him self of the
people is more exellent / and (as Pau le (...)) is (...) of double honor yet
that not withsta^dyng / the respect and regard of all the hole people to gider
/ ought to be gretter tha^ of one bishop: ye and if a man did (...) this also
/ that the dygnyte also of ye hole multitude ought to be gretter / than the
dignyte of any one bishop / his saying does not utterly disagre (...) is so^
what like to ye saye^g of Christ

Our lord Jesus asks this question in the gospel: whether (...) to be gretter
and more worshypful / he that serves and wayteth at the table / or he that
sytteth at ye table. Is not he the gretter (says Christ) which sytteth at the
table? But the people are those children and sons of the spouse / which as
honorable persons sytteth at the table or board of ye gos pel. The prelates of
the church be ministers which stands by / and walks to and fro lokyng
about / that no thing be wantyng to any of the gestes syttyng at that board /
and that which they perceive to be most co^uenyent and mete for each man / yt
they bring forth out of the rich storehouse of the spouse / which is Christ
If Christ / which without co^trauer sye or doubt / is gretter than al co^pa
rison / did call him self a minister or servant / and behaved him self as a
ser uaunt / even unto the wasshyng of his apostels feet. What aught the
bishops to do / which according to the mind of saint Hierome / are fathers
/ not lords / but mynisiers / to whom the dispensation and mynystration of the
mysteries of god / is committed and betaken / not the authorite which also may
fall in to sin as well as other men / and are ignorant them selves in many
things. Let the bishops therefore rule and govern the people / but as a fader
rules his children or sons / and as the husband rules his well-beloved
spousesse or wife. Neither let the bishop wene that it is lauful for him to do
what soever him list with his flock / of ye which he shall give acco^pte and
recke nyng to the heed shepherde / and the ve ry pastor Christ. And let him
reme^ bre this thing also / that his authorite is to be defended and maynteyned
not only by sharp and strait co^mau^ dementes / by proud and stately
conntynau^ce / by (...) or (...) / and punysshme^tes or vengaunce / (with the
which things / not so mo che as the very tyrants are wont / suffyciently to
maintain their authorite) but rather with purite and ho lynesse of lyueng /
with meekness / with myldnesse and ge^tilnesse / with (...) doctrine / with
fatherly monicio^s with loving and friendly exhortatio^s. Paul / in punysshyng
him which had his fathers wife / executed and showed forth ye authorite of an
apostel / but how oftentimes does the same Paul humble him self / spekyng
fair / prayeng / besechyng / (...) / requeryng in gods behalf Co^tynual
purite and cle^nesse of life / is a certain thing worthy to be honored and had
in reverence. An Eua^ gelycal mind / dispisyng riches / dis pisyng houours /
dispisyng pleasures / desirous to do good to al men / ready to put even his life
i^ ieoperdy for the sauegarde of ye flock committed unto him / wi^neth the
favor of the people / more than a man would believe. A mind replenysshed with
knowledge of holy scripture / a tongue no less holy than eloquent / vtteri^g and
bri^gyng forth of the rich store house of Christ / both old things and
new / makes ye people to look up / and purchases to him self great
reverence and worship. By these things chefely the authorite of the bishops
is both gotten and defended / much better and more safely tha^ by these words:
We ordain / we decre and determyne / we charge / we command / we wol / and
such other. Such things as I rehearsed her before / causes that the people
wyllyngly of their own accord / does a great deal more than is required of
them / and that they be more styred with fatherly exhortation than with any
manacyng or threttes / be they never so lordly / shar pe / and cruel. Do we not
se / as often as any man spri^geth up / commended with any manner opinion of
holiness / and which appears to be a true preacher of the gospel: how
greatly the (...) does sauer him with all their herts / how desirous they are
to here him / how they mark and regard his words / how al their mind is
holly given and set to give head to that which comes from his mouth? If
they did se and parceyue a very father ly mind / such as Paul or Peter had /
what thing would not the people do? The disciples received Pau le non otherwise
/ than if he had been Christ him self / being ready even to pluck out their
own eyes / and to have given them to him / if he had desy red it. By this
means shall ye order best be mayntayned and (...) / and their authorite be made
fyrme and stable / and peace and concord sted fastly co^tynue: if both parts
strive and labor each to ouerco^e other with benefaytes / and doing their
dewty to other / for (...) it is but a tyrannycal peace / when ye people
opp^ssed with (...) / rests and are quiet in their bodies / but in their
mi^de does grudge against their superiors / and curses and wyssheth yuel unto
the^. Neither let any man cry out / the autho rite of the prelates and
bishops forth with to be mynisshed / if prouisyon be made for the lyberte and
quietness of the people. First this thing belo^ geth to the mayntenau^ce of
the bishops authorite / that the people do judge well / and have good opynion of
them. But that man seems to have little good opynion of them / whi che iugeth
them to be of that mind that they would their subjects to be wrapped and
entangled with very ma ny snares and (...) of co^stitutio^s so that they might
rule after their own pleasure. That man only has good (...) of the bishop /
which iugeth him self to be of that mind that he coueteth very (...) / his
(...) to be as free as might be in Christ / and at lyberte from (...) ce and
enta^glyng of scrupulusnesse and gyleful snares. For that man does nothing
derogate or mynisshe of ye kings authorite / which would not that he might do
any thing contrary to right and good conscience / contrary to the common laws
/ contrary to ye customs and privileges of the cytezins / contrary to the oath
which he made at his coronation. Nay / rather he takes a way ye hole
authorite of the king / which iugeth that of ye king which is more mete to be
thought and iuged of tpra^tes / than of a lau full prince. Wherefore if the king
do not require or look / yt any man should be bound by his commandment or
statute to any pain / either of paying money / or else of suffryng in his body
/ except his statute be rightful and according to equite / reasonable / and
made after dew form and manner: and approved by the consent of the people /
and finally does not require / that every manner co^stitution should make them
bound to ieoperdy of their lives / does not that man seem to judge the bishop
to be a very (...) which iudeth him to be of yt mind that he would his (...)
to be bou^ de with all manner constitutio^s of his making to ye (...) of hell?
But the laws of (...) and lay princes: are (...) full of (...) and thret nyng
/ and with a pain so^what (...) pe and cruel / does (...) me^ rather than
punysshe the^. What manner and law / that law of the. xii. tables is said to
have been / which commanded that the body of that man should be cut in
sonder / which was in debt to many men / and not able to pay and satisfye
them. And those poets and wise men of ye old time / feared the unlearned
multitude / and not able to be handled and ruled with the reasons of philosophy
/ away from yuel doing with the lyghtnyng of Jupiter / taking ve^geau^ce upon
malefacters / with the saynynges of ye furies / the punysshers of great sins
/ of Kadama^thus judge in hell / and of other terrible and dredeful pains and
turme^tes / which the fowls of yuel men should suffer there after this life.

Though we do grant to ye lay princes somewhat of such manner fay nyng / yet I
do not think that it is to be received in the bishops / which professes the
doctryn of ye truth of the gospel. But who so ever commands or makes a law
/ casts on an halter or snare to bind men / but who so ever exhorts /
does so call men to the better things / that he do not take from them their
liberte Paraue^ture some man will say / an exhortation is to weak a thing and
of to small strength: it is nedeful to command and make laws / for the sturdy
and unruly persons. Me se meth the contrary. Ofte^tymes / more is obtained and
gotten with fatherly exhortation / than with tyra^nycal and cruel exaction. Let
this be counted a lie / if we do not find it true by daily experience in our
wives and chil dren / and except Roboam to his great hurt and myschefe has
taught it to be true / which had yuel chance and luck / of following the
cruel and thret nyng counsel of his young co^panyo^s. If the people shall se
one whi che is a very priest or bishop i^ deed his exhortation shall be of (...)
and strength. But if open wicked (...) corrupt and unclean manners / gross ig
nora^ce / insactable couetusnes / barbarical crudelyte / shall have (...) him
utterly out of favor with the people: what shall it avail or profit to
command and to make co^stitutions? They which will not obey / shall sin more
grievously for cause of their co^tumacy and stubbernesse and they which shall
obey only for sear / shall deserve nothing at al / or else very little / for
asmoch as no man sulfylleth the precepte / which fulful leth it / being
compelled there unto by violence. ye / and paraue^ture his ypocrisy doubleth the
offense: It lies than most of al in our own selves that our exhortation / be
it never so gentel and loving / may be of authorite and regarded among the
people. Therefore they do very well / which prouydeth that the authorite of the
prelates may be saved / but they pro uyde very yuel for it / which will ha ue it
to be saved and mayntayned hose non other wise tha^ with threttes and fear. But
in ye mean season it is rizt and according / that some provision be made to
save the lyberte of ye slocke, as much as equite requereth / for it also has
a certain authorite belongyng to it self / and that no small or light
authorite. Does not custo^e (...) and disanul a law / in so mo che that a law
is not worthy to be called a law / except it be approved by the consent of
the people / which grudgeth not to use it? What thing has disanulled and made
of no strenght / so many co^stitutions made in the last counsel / called
Consilium laterane^s / which began under pope July the second / and was
fynisshed and ended under pope Leo the tenth.

Was it not the custom and usage of the people / which were never mided to
obey the co^stitutio^s and decrees which were made in that cou^sayse.
Doutlesse such is ye voice of the peo ple / which same also is called ye voi
ce of god / such is the authorite of the fre multitude: a regard and respect
of the which is mete to be had / as of tentymes as it goth not a wry from the
rule of virtue and holiness. Where fore he shall give good counsel / who so
ever will so moderate and order his counsel / that both parts be provided for
indifferently. Now as concerning the offendyng of our neighbors conscience /
how much it is to be regarded / let us consider in few words. Our capitayn
and master Jesu Christ / sometime regards ye offendyng of other me^ / and
applied him self to avoid the same. Again at another time here guarded it not
/ that ye phariseis were offended. He would be born of a ma ried woman / he was
circumcised / he observed the ceremonies appointed and commanded in the law /
he did fast / lest any thing might have be laid against him / wherein it mizt
appear of lyklyhode that he had don wickedly / or contrary to justice. But he
did not cesse to preche his father / he did not cesse to teache the heavenly
philosophy / he cessed not to do good to al me^ / he feared not to heal men on
the sabbot day / though the phari seis were grieved with these things / he gave
occasyon to Herod also to be offended / to whom he would make non answer / and
therefore Herod despised him. And in a certain place / when he was warned and
told / that the phariseis were offended: What answer made he? Let them alone
(says he) they are blind gydes of the blind. According to his enfa^ple / the
apostels also in many things applied themselves to the infir myte and
weakness of the jews / feste any thing might have hyndred or let the
course and going forward of the gospel. But yet did they not in all things /
nor at al times auoy de the offendyng of al men / for the jews could not with
any cryenge out of them / cause them to co^pel the gentyls to be circumcised.
This thing only they did for a season / having respect to the inuyncyble
pertynacy and fro wardnesse of the jews / yt they commanded the gentyles to
abstain from fornycation / from the blood / and from the beast which was suffo
cated / and from the flesh which was offered in sacrifyce to ydols. Paul did
shave of the here of his heed / he used the manner and ceremonys of the jews /
in the feestes called the Nudi pedales: he did purifye him self among other in
the temple / to the^tent that he might mytigate and pacifye the mind of
certain persons / whi che were ready to have raised up sedi tion and strife. But
although he did these things / yet where so ever he might (...) he spoke
against them / he confesses and knowlegeth that it is sauful to eat al manner
meats / but a chance salleth other whiles / that it is not expedient to use
this lyberte. He (...) to us the syberte of the gospel / but charity which
measures al things by the profit of the neighbor / other whiles wyllyngly
forgoth of her right and lyberte / but not utterly in every thing / neither
co^tynually and at al (...) / but in the mean season strives to her power
against the infyr mite and weakness of them which un discrete are offended
without cause / and for things of small value / un till that they also do
profit and grow up to such strength of spirit / that they be no longer
offended with those things / which of their own nature are neither good nor
yuel. Paul as concerning the use of meats / other whiles among the jews was
made as a jew / to the end yt he myzt win the jews to Christ. Again among
the ge^tyles he became a gen tile / to win them also But it should be an
unseemly thing and against rea son / if any man no we a days also would
likewise among the jews become a jew / abstaynyng from the meats which are
forbidden and not lauful to be eaten among them / (...) he might ronnein to the
hatered of the jews. Ye moreover Paul rebu keth Peter / by canse that (when
the doctrine of Christ was so publysshed and sprede abroad / that it was mete
and according for the jews being taugh and monisshed to have forsaken and
cast away their superstitious weakness) yet he / lest he should have offended
the jews / did withdraw him self from the company of the gentyles / and
would not eat with them / and so auoydyng to offend the jews / he fell in to
a more grievous offendyng of the gentiles.

That time was / as aman would say / the infancy and first age of the gospel.
And the relygion of ye law which they had learned and received of their
forefathers / and which also was confyrmed by long usage and custom / was so
fast grounded and roted inwardly in ye minds of the jews / that this
affection for a season was to be pardoned and to be suf fred in them / for as
much as it did spring and rise of an honest cause and could not suddenly be
again (...) out of the minds os men. Moreover of this offendyng / great
ieopardy should have followed.

The nation of the jews / which toughly cleued to the custom used of their
forefathers / was turned to the hatered of the gospel. The gentyles so hated
and abhorred the bur thayn of Moses law / that many of them could find in
their hertes rather to have renou^ced Christ again / than to receive the
ceremonies and law of ye jews. And when nothing is more abhomynable tha^
idolatry / yet he that dydeate of the flesh which was offered in sacryfyce to
an idol at that time / gave a sykely occasyon to be suspected / as though he
did favor and agree to the superstition of them / with whom he did eat. And
yet cries Paul / even in this also / ye law to be abro gated and of no
strength: he cries that an ydole is nothing / that the flesh offered to an
idol is nothing else / but as other flesh is: he rebukes that man / who so
ever wytti^gly offends his brother with his eating. But again he chydeth him
/ which iugeth another man's conscience in meat or drink / and which
speaks yuel of his brother for the meat sake / for the which he gives
thanks to the goodness and lyberalyte of the lord / which has created and
made al things / to the behoue and use of men. He scorneth the folysshe
wisdom of them / which as though they had taught a certain great thing /
did say. Touch not / taste not / handyl not. As the superstitious choice of
meats which the jews used by the counsel and authorite of Paul has begone
to (...) dispi sed / after that ye gospel is now suffyciently publysshed and
openly known. So of lykelyhode it seems / yt the meat offered to an ydole /
is to be dispysed / seeing that it is now suffyciently known / that christen
men may with pure and clean conscience eat al manner of meats / according to
the necessyte of the body / gyueng thanks to him / which has ordained and
provided al things yt are in this world / for his worshippers. When he him
selse is lord of al thin ges / and which would nothing to be impure or
unclean to those persons / which be pure and clean.

Wherefore to conclude / seeing that the lauful cause to be offended / cesseth:
Seeing also that the kingdom of god is neither meat ne drink / and seeing that
the abstaynyng from certain meats / provoke the most part of rich men to
superfluyte and delycate fare / and does cruelly grieve and pain the poor men.
It is to be consydred and looked on / whether we ought to strive so greatly as
we do for such manner constitutions.

In that time whereof we spoke before / the apostels for a season did that thing
which they thought most expedient for the fortherau^ce of the gospel / which
than was young and new begone. Somewhat they applied them selves to the
affections of men / remaining of the manner of lyueng which they had used
aforetyme. And that they so did / it was but for a season / of charity and not
of right or necessyte / and they did not so in all things nor at al times
neither yet without spekyng agai^nst such infyrmite / as we have said before.
But no we adays / how for tuneth it that occasyon to be offended is takenne of
such things / the use whereof is not forbidden by the gos pel / but rather ye
forbidders of them are condemned by the writynge of Paul the apostel.
Forbyddynge (says he) the meats / which god has created to be eaten / and
sorbyd dyng to mary or wedde. Finally how farforthe seems the greuyng or
offending of our neighbor to be avoided? Paul did forbear and abstain from
ye flesh which was offered to an idol / but not except he had been warned
before / that it was sacrifyced to ydoles. But the same Paul did eat all
manner meats / askyng no question / for hurtyng another man's conscience. And
yet in this thing / whereof we do now speak / the offendyng of other me^nes
conscience might be avoided / without any great grefe or inco^modite: for he
that for a season did refrayn from flesh offered to an ydole / had other
flesh at hand which he mizt (...). If any man did (...) from builes flesh
which was offered to Neptunus / he might eat partrych or capon / which was
not offered to any false god: and yet did they not so much as abstain from
flesh which was offered to idols / but one ly when they saw occasion. Some
man abstayned from swynes flessh and did eat a plouer. But now a days when
for ye most part of the hole year / the eating of al manner flesh is
forbidden: thynkest thou it right or reason / that I for ye weak nesse and
superstityousnesse of this man or that / should stand in ieoperdy of my health
and of my life / seeing that by this time / all christen men ought to have been
taught / that they should not judge their neighbor by such manner things? But
if it seem to be / that chusten charity so mo che ought to apply it self to ye
weke nesse of unlearned or superstycyous persons / that to avoid the offendyng
of them / we would have him which is strong in conscience / to run in to
ieopardy of his health or of his life. Why do we not yt same / in those things
wherein is just and manifest occasyon of offendyng other men. There be prelates
of ye church / which when they have year ly rentes and possessions / so great
/ that they may compare in richesse with any kings / yet neither they do
teach yt people / and besides that lives wickedly / even in the open sight of
the people / so that the vnler ned men are offended thereby. But here in this
thing / we do nothing regard the offendynge of their consciences / but rather
of the weak per sons. We do require so great fyrmyte and strength / that they
are co^maun ded to believe / except they had leauer be counted heretykes / that
what so ever thing is done by them / outher wha^ they lose or bind / or wha^
they bless or curse / or else wha^ they grant forth pardons or restrain them
/ is of the same strength / as if it had be don by the apostel Paul / Andrewe
or James. And yet this offendynge of the people ryseth of a thing which of the
own kind and nature is so yuel / that though men would take none occasyon
thereof to be offended / yet ought it to be auoy ded and eschewed / for as much
as it offends the eyes of god. Beside this / though al manner of backbytige
appears to each man for to be unlawful / and a great sin: yet in this thing
we do not regard the of fendyng of weak persons / but bol dely and strongly
we follow our own appetyte and affection. In these things only which are
so lauful / that who so ever forbyddeth them / needs great defense / lest he
might seem to do clean against the doctrine of the gospel: so much we do
regard the offendynge of weak persons / that for the folysshe superstition of
them / we would have our brother to stand in ieopardy of his life / rather
than to eat certain metes / which are necessary for him.

Is not this to transgress the com maundementes of god / for the traditions of
men? I know right well most exellent prelate / that your holiness has said a
pretty while ago for what entente are these so many things spoken? Is it to
disalo we the choice of meats / which the use and custom of the church
has allowed / and yet does allow? To speak ye truth plainly / as I do (...):
I would feign that al things which are of this kind and sort / or else at
the lestwise / the exaction of such things were clean rydde out of the way /
so yt what so ever were abated or taken away from ceremonies / should be added
to the exercyses and works of true holiness. And so that as much as the
iudaical and superstitious manner of living should decreace and be minisshed /
so much ye true christian manner of lyueng / myzt encreace and be augmented.
But if the common sort of unlearned persons / can not utterly be kept in doing
their dewty / with out such manner of ceremonies / yet I would not the christian
lyberte to be clogged with very many such / I would not the consciences to be
so bound / that they should believe that they did deedly sin if they did eat
/ except it were don of a froward / a stubburne / and a disobedient mi^de. I
would not that of an unreasonable judgment and clean out of or der / those
things should be so greatly regarded / which of them selves are almost of no
value. And those things nothing regarded and set by / without the which
there can be no good lyueng according to ye gos pel. But these things / seeing
that they be fast rooted by use and custom: I would not that they should be
sedy ciouslye dispysed / but outher to be put down by little and little / or else
to be taken away by the authoryte of the heedes and rulers / but so taken away
/ that in the mean season the people should be called and exhor ted to better
things. But here parauenture some man will obiecte and lay against me / that
such manner ceremonys / though they do not much good / or be not greatly
profitable / at the lestwyse they do no hurt / ye / and this ferforth does
help to good lyuenge / that they put us in remembrance of true and inward
holiness / and are as guydes or lea ders / to enduce the weak and vnler ned
persons to true virtue / likewise as the law of Moses was to the jews: And
we do se / how great the weakness is of christen men also. The eating of
flesh forbidden puts us in remembrance and teaches / that al ryote and
superfluyte and what so ever thing is wont to follow superfluyte / are to be
avoided and eschewed. Fasting co^mau^ ded / puts us in remembrance and tea
cheth / that we ought to abstayn from al vices and sins / for that only is
the (...) that is pleasant and acceptable to god. If this reason does like and
please so greatly / than let us be circumcised also / seeing that circumcisyon
both does abate of the delecta tion and pleasures in gendring / and also
puts us in remembrance / that the heart and mind is to be circumcised /
from al gross and carnal affections. Let us than also slay bestes and make
sacryfice of them / for this thing puts us in remembrance / that the
brutyssh and beestly affections of our minds / are to be tamed and subdued.
But that we might be monysshed and put in (...) by such manner of (...) res / it
is suffycient for us / that these things were in the old time relygiously
observed of the jews / for if true holiness were nothing hyndred by
ceremonys / why does Pau le so ferue^ntly eueriwhere fight against the
ceremonies: of the law of Moyeses? Of a certayntie / these things if there be
to many of them and immeasurably used / oppresses the lyberte of the gospel. To
put our trust and confyde^ce in these things (as the most part of the people
does) is the very pestylence and dystructyon of true holiness / for of these
thyn ges / to backbyte thy brother / is the venyin and poison of the relygion
of the gospel / No doubt of it / Paul parceyued these things very well / when
he so fercely kept war (...) the law of the jews / being about to break
in or to approach nigh to the manners and lyueng of (...) men. Ye / if I had
layser / I could make you perceive and understand / yt every grettest decay
and myscheues of the christen common wealth / has spronge out and had their
beginning of ceremonies. I do not allow ye stubber nesse and disobedient minds
of these men / which openly and scornfully / as in dispite of the common custom
/ has eaten flesh. But so farsorth I dis allow them / that I do judge them to
be taught / to be monysshed / and if need require / to be rebuked also / but
not to be accused unto the heed officers and rulers / as though they were
gyltie of murdri^ge their own father or mother. and my judgment is / yt this
matter is rather to be despised and made light of / than to be grievously ha^
dsed. At the lest wise for this cause / lest of this spark kyndled a gretter
fire might grow / and more hatered a gaynst the clergy / which is to great /
and over much al ready. It does displease me / what so ever thing pertayneth to
sedition and stryse. But yet if no man should resyst and withsta^de su che
manner ceremonies always increacyng and waxing more and more / ye syberte of
the gospel should be distro yed for ever / but there is no man to whom it is
more co^uenyent to with stand them / than the heedes and ru lers of the
church. So crope in by ly tell and little ye custom / which has made ye friday a
fyssh day. Afterward when this was well (...) to pass / saturday also was taken
from us / and no we wednisday also is i^ great ieopardy. And for such manner
cere monyes we se so many men to be so re afflycte to be in ieoperdy / ye
finally to dye: and we se many men to stand folysshly in their own conceyte /
and to think them selves true cri sten men / when they are in deed very jews
/ and for the trust and confydence which they have in these things / to
regard no whyt those things which belongs to true holiness and virtuous
lyueng / but ye cha rite of the gospel teaches us / to socour and help those
which are in afflyction. The lyberte of the gospel / ought not with such
things brought in out of mesure / to be called away from more earnest and
sad studyes / and exercises or pastymes. And thus farforth be it spoken
generally of such manner things / not because I would defend those presu^p
tuous and disobedyent persons / but ye your wysedom / after that the
circu^staunces of the cause be examyned and discussed / might provide and look
about / that neither more nor less were done / than the thing it self
requires.

NO we will I plede mine own cause i^ few words / not because I have given
occasyon to any good man for to be offended / for that which I did / I would
not have been a (...) to have done it / if Christ him self had sytten at ye
same table with me. For I was i^ that state / that any man would have (...) me
more worthy to be piteed tha^ to be rebuked. But that not withsta^ dyng / I will
not suffer that among those which knows not the matter as it is in very deed
/ any man myzt cloak his own boldness by mine example / or by my necessyte
defend his own indiscreet presumption.

First I did not (...) or exhort any man to eat flesh without necessytie /
but rather I taught / that the common custom is to be folo wed and observed. I
my self have such affection to ward flesh / yt if I might mayntayn and
save my life with pees and fetches / I would neither desire flesh ne (...).
Moreover not withstandyng yt I am wont al most each lent to be in great
ioperdy / by the reason of weakness and sicklynesse of my body / and of a
certain natural hatered that I have to war des fysshe. In so much that ye
physycions have oftentimes called on me / and counsayled me to help my self
by eating flesh. vet I did ne uer follow their counsel / but ones in Italye
(when the phisycion had thretned me tha^ certain days / that there was none
other way with me but death / unless I would follow his counsel. And yet for all that / I did after his counsel but a few days only / and thus farsorth
/ that I did eat the brothe of flesh tempred with the (...) of eggs /
abstaynyng from the flesh self / whi che although my mind had desired yet
my stomach would not have received / so weak and feeble it was at that time:
and now a few days in this lent / and that by the commandment of the
phisycion / and not with out license and pardone of ye pope / whose bulls I
have had ready to show these certain years / yet did I never use them before
now / as concerning the eating of flesh. Admytte that I did this without
yt phisycions authorite. What phisycion knows better this my weak body than
my self? But the case put / that I had done it without any pardon or license:
Does not necessyte excuse better than any perdone?

First consider mine age / ye weakness and crachynesse of my body almost
co^tynual / consider ye labor and traueyle of iournayeng / the labors i^
studyeng / wherein I am bu syed contynually / above the strength of both my
body and mind. Moreover / the murre and fleme / nay rather a very pestyle^ce
payned and vexed me almost. xx. days. The same having recourse after a
certain space between / held me both longer and more grievously. Besides this
/ a ly tell before lent / ye stone took me with a marvelous pain and
turme^tynge of al my body. This disease though it be most sharp and cruel and
most ready paryl and ieopardy is in it of all diseases (for women are not in mo
re ieopardy of life when they traueyle of child) yet almost every se conde day
it had recourse to me / so that with a wretched and a paynful frutefulnesse / I
did (...) in one day / and traueyled the next day / and in the third was
delivered. What wise man would not say that I had been a murdrer of mine own
self / if I had abstayned from flesh being in that case? He yt will follow
Erasmus / let him solowe him in every point / and he shall not be blamed. Now
what perteyneth the example of Erafmus / to them whi che are strong and in
good health / whi che ar ydel / which are dro^ken / which eats in dispyte or
for a scorn / not for any necessyte. Now there remains one doubt / as
concerning the offendyng of weak persons. I do not deny but that christian
chary tie counsayleth / in every thing as much as may be / to provide that
weak persons have none occasyon given to them wherefore they might be offended.
I here Paul ready to abstain from the eating of flesh al his life long /
rather than that he would offend his neighbor with his eating. But the same
Paul / as we have said before: does chyde and rebuke those which (...) their
brother for meat or drink. And in the mean season he reckeneth them to be
most pestylent / which did for bydde to eat the meats which god has
ordained to the use of man.

Why doste thou (says he) (...) another man's servant? he stands or (...)
to his lord or master and wherefore am I iuged of another man's conscience in
that thing / for the which I give thanks to god? He that eats / let him
not dispyse him that does not eat: And he that eats not / let him not judge
that par sone which eats. After the mind than and judgment of Paul / he is
the weaker person of ye two which does not eat. And he synneth more grievously
/ which iugeth one that is bet ter than him self / and to who^ he ought rather
to have give place. And yet charity / which atte^preth and applies her self
to al men / gives place for a season to the weakness of this person / if he
be offended of any probable or lykly cause / and if he can not be amended: but
not utterly in every thing / and at al times. For there is some thing / wherein
the weak person is to be monysshed and taught. There is / wherein he is to be
rebuked or repreued. There is also / wherein he is to be dispysed / for else by
conty nual applyeng to their minds / to do nothing else / but norisshe the
disease and sickness of weak persons in conscye^ce / is the straightest and
next way / to distroy al Eua^gelycal holy nesse. And yet Paul speaks of
infyrmyte and weakness / which was welnere (...) / which by ye reason that
they had received it of their elders and auncesters / and also of long usage
and custom / was so depely soken and settled in the minds of men / that it
could not suddenly be plucked out again / for so the jews coul de not suffer
the law to be abrogat and disanussed / in which they were born and brought up
/ and had co^tynued in the relygious observation thereof to their old age. So
some man of the gentyls / if he should have seen a christen man syttyng at the
table among company / where was set before them flesh / which had been offered
to ydols / he could not but suspecte / that that christen man does co^sente
to the superstition of the^ / with whom he kept company at meal. And yet for all that / Paul cries out stoutly and boldly in the mean season that an ydole
is nothing / and that it is lau sul to eat what so ever thing is sol de in the
shambles. He cries / that the ceremonies of the law / which were ordained
for a season / ought to be abolysshed and put a way / when the gospel should
take place and be of strength. And to make an end / he withstode Peter / and
rebuked him to his face / because he was not yet bol de to set light by the
vayn offe^dyng of the jews. Therefore it was another kind and manner of
offendynge ye neighbor / whereof Paul did speak / the occasyon whereof rose by
rea son of a rooted custom / which they had used in their life before led.
But we gendre and seche daily to our selves / new matter and occasyons to be
offended after this manner and (...) though we do se and perceive well enough /
ho we great hurt and hynderaunce of true holiness has gro wen thereof to ye
life of men. Paul suffers the weak persons / but upon this hope: that they
would profit and grow up to syrmyte and strength of conscience. We do (...)
and (...) al togider to ceremonies / having no mind or regard of those
things / which alone does make be trewly virtuous and good lyuers. But to
return again to mine own cause how so ever the matter stands / as
concerning the auoydyng of offendynge our neighbor / neither i^ this thing
shall any man think (as I trow) that there lacks in me charity / couetyng to
give place to ye infyrmyte and weakness of my neighbor. I had ordained the
popes pardon / as a preseruatyue against such manner offenses / for I do not se
for what other use it is good or pro fytable to me. furthermore / as mo che as
I might / I did eat flesh se cretely. ye / moreover I did utterly abstayn
from flesh / even to ye ma nyfest and open ieopardy of my life / oftentimes
disobeynge the cousayls of phiscyciens. What can I do more / except that (for
to avoid the supersticyous weakness / I will not say the perverse masyce of
certain persons / which fyndeth sautes with every thing) I should also dye.
He should be an vncharytable man (I trow) which would require this thing of
me / and I my self should be a manqueller / if I would do according to his
request.

It belongs to the charity of a christen man / to interpret and judge every
thing to ye best / what so ever may be done with a good mind and purpose. And
those which be learned in the christen faith / ought to have known that
fasting and eating of fysshe / was not commanded and apoyn ted for the^
which are in ieoperdy by ye reason of sickness / but to such whi che are in
ieoperdy by reason of ra^cknesse and wanto^nesse of ye flessh. But if any man
yet be very superstitious / if he that eats flesh / do monyssh and
counsel him by these words.

Brother / let not mine example a ny thing offend you / I am co^stray ned to
do yt I do / would god I were more helthy: I am glad of (...) strength and
health / do not you wrongfully accuse my feblenesse and weakness. He has
sufficiently (as I wene) dis charged his own conscience: but no we to make an
end. In like manner as I do judge the^ worthy to be sharply rebuked / which of
a sedytious presu^ption and boldness / does violate and break the common
custom / namely such a custom which is not contrary to true holiness and
good lyueng Some seems yt the curates and prea chers should do very well / if
by ye au thorite of the bishops / they did denou^ce fasting to the people / in
this wise. Derely the hole life of christen men ought by co^tynual soberness
to be a certain fast / not only from meats / but much more from al manner
riote / and from al pleasures of this world / from carnal affections or
desires of the flessh / which warreth always against the spyrite. But yet
nevertheless / the authorite of ye church / and the custom of our elders and
fore fathers / exhorts and calls upon us / that such as may for strength of
body / for lauful age / and plenty of substance / should prepare their minds
with fasting to ye holy day. But let your fast be such as becomes christen men
/ if you will that it be acceptable and plesau^t to Jesus Christ: let it be an
hole and parfyte fast. It is the lest part of fasting / the abstyne^ce of
certain meats: it is an vnplesaunt fast to god / whereby peace and co^corde is
broken. They that do fast / let the^ give thanks to god for ye strength of
their body / whi che by abstyne^ce and fasting / is made more apt and mete to
godly things. And they which do not fast / let the^ give thanks to the lord
/ which of his lyberalyte and goodness / does my nyster diverse plenty of
meats / to norisshe and comfort our weak and feeble bodies with all. They that
fasteth / let them not stand therefore in their own co^ceyte / as though they
did a great and an exelle^t thing / except they put to greatter and better
things. They which fasteth not / let them so much the more endeuer by
godly exercyses and works / that they may make recompense and amends for
that thing / which the weakness of body will not suffer the^ to do. He that
does not abstayn / let him not trouble the common custom / and let him avoid
the offendyng of weak persons / as much as he may co^uenyently. He that does
abstain / let him beware ye he judge not his neigh bour (against the doctrine
both of Christ and the apostels) of such things which of their own nature are
indifferent / and may be done outher well or yuel. He does less sin whi che
suppeth al his life without any need / than he which for meat or dri (...)
sclaundreth and backbyteth his ney ghbour / whom according to the co^
mau^dement of god / he ought to love as well as his own self. Such manner
monytions and counsayls / by cause they help greatly to the purpose / are
ofte^tymes among to be re hersed to the people. Moreover this thing also / I
would sayn to be plain ly declared and showed, for the weak and fraysul
consciences sakes / whi che co^stitutyons bind / and whom they bind: and whom
they bind not: and how farforth they bind / or not bind. Neither I do
think in my mind / that so narowe bounds or meares are to be set and
marked out / in these things which may be released of man / let these be
gentyl and favorable fatherly charity.

But against envy / against back bytyng / against manslaughter / and against
wars / and such other un douted and very pestylences and poisons of the
christyan holiness: let the authorite of ye bishops be sharp and cruel.
These things I thought best to write to you most worshypful man and most
virtuous prelate / not that I would teach you which are moft learned / or
plede my cause: and defend my self before your highness / which knows
both my labors in studies / which I have taken for the common profytes sake /
and also this my mind / whi che desires nothing less tha^ meat or drink /
and the weakness of my body which is increased by old age and this present
disease which cleueth to me and vexes me to to much: But that by you I might
outher pacifye or heal other men / if my deed happily has offended any men /
or mine example has drawn any to ouermoche liberty or boldness. And that
these things somewhat largely has been dysputed of me: there was none other
cause else / but only that I had very good opi nyon of your synguler wisdom /
and gentylnesse or patience. For when I did consider and call to my re
nembrau^ce / the nobleness of your (...) / your most pure and (...) manners and
exellent learning / ynally your synguler wisdom / and other gifts and
virtues / semely for a bishop / I did not fear / feste you would take any
thing in to sus (...) / which were spoken so^what boldly and largely / of the
oflyce and dew tie of bysshoppes. I pray god that well might your highness fare
/ most holy and virtuous prelate.
