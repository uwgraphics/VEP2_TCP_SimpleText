A new Ballad entitled, A Bell-man for England, which night and day does
sta(...). (...)ring in all men's hearing, Gods vengeance is at hand.
To the tune of, O man in desperation.


A Wake, awake, oh England,
sweet England now awake,
And to thy prayers speedily,
b^^as thou thy self betake:
The Lord thy God is coming,
within the sky so clear:
Repent with speed thy wickedness,
the day it draws near.
The dreadful day of vengeance
is shortly now at hand,
When fearful burning ^re
shall waste both (...) and Land:
And all men's hearts shall fail them
to see such things appear:
Repent therefore oh England,
the day it draws near.
The worldly wise and prudent
shall fall besides their wits,
And wish the hills to cover them,
in these their frantic fits:
No succor, help, nor comfort,
for them shall then appear:
Repent therefore oh England,
the day it draws near.
The Seas and Rivers ^^^^ing,
shall roar in grievous wise,
The beasts in pasture feeding,
shall strain forth grievous cries:
The skies shall (...) with fire,
the earth shall burn so clear:
Repent therefore oh England,
the day it draws near.
The glorious holy Angels
shall their their Trumpets sound,
The dead shall hear their voy^^^,
as they lie in the ground:
Then all the graves shall open,
and dead men shall appear
Before the Lord in judgment,
the day it draws near.
The Devil will then be ready,
each creature to accuse,
And show how in their life time,
they did themselves abuse:
And every man's own^ conscience,
for witness shall appear:
Repent therefore oh England,
the day it draws near.
The works of every creature^
their thou^gts and deeds, I say,
Shall follow them together,
in that most dreadful day:
And no respect of persons,
shall at that time appear:
Repent therefore oh England,
the day it draws near.
But such as have done justly,
shall wear the Crown^ of life,
The wicked shall be damned
to f^rrow, pain, and grief,
In boiling brants of brimstone,
with doleful heavy cheer:
Repent therefore oh England,
the day it draws near.
But woe unto the women,
that then with child shall go^,
And to the ^lly nurses,
which do give suck also:
When as the day of judgment
so grievous shall appear:
Repent therefore oh England,
the day it draws near.
And pray with hearts most constant
unto the Lord of might,
That in the frozen Winter,
you do not take your flight:
Nor that upon the Sabbath
that peril do appear:
Repent therefore oh England,
the day it draws near.
Let all good Christian people
repent therefore in time,
And from their hearts lamenting
each former grievous crime,
Prepar^ themselves with gladness^
to match when Christ shall come;
The Trumpe shall sound on sudden,
and no man knows how soon.
For all things be fulfilled,
which Christ before had told,
Small faith is now remaining,
and charity is grown cold:
Great signs and wonders we have seen
both in the earth and sky:
Repent therefore oh England,
the Judgment day is ni^.
Why do thou put thy confidence
in strong and stately towers:
Why take thou such pleasure,
in building sumptuous bowres,
Rejoicing in thy Pastures,
and Parkes of ^allow Dear ^
Repent therefore oh England,
the day it draws near.
Why seek thou deceitfully
to purchase treasure great?
And why do thou, through usury
the blood of poor men eat?
Why does thy life and living,
so filthily appear?
Repent with speed thy wickedness:
the day it draws near.
Wherefore let all good people
upon their knees proceed,
In making earnest prayer:
(for never was more need)
That God may spare (...) punishments
even for his mercy (...),
And give us grace to bear in mind
the Iudgement-day is near.
FINIS.

^he Deadmans Song, whose dwelling was near unto Ba^ing Hall in London.
To the tune of Flying Fame.
(...)cke, dear friends, long time I was,
(...)nd weakly laid in bed:
(...) five hours in all men's sight
(...)gth I lay as dead:
(...) rung out, my friends came in,
(...)nd I key cold was found:
(...)en was my carcass brought from bed,
(...)nd cast upon the ground.
(...) loving wife did w^pe full sore,
(...)d children loud did cry:
(...)iends did mourn, yet thus they said,
(...) is borne to die:
(...) winding sheet prepared was,
(...)y grave was also made:
(...) l^ng h^ures by just report,
(...) this same case I laid.
(...)ng which time, my soul did see
(...) strange and fearful sights,
(...) for to hear the same dis^losd,
(...) banish all delights.
(...)th the Lord restored my life,
(...)ich from my body fled:
(...)ll d^clare what sights I saw,
(...)e time that ^ was dead.
(...) thoug^t along a gallant green,
w^ere pleasant flowers sprung,
took my way whereas me thought,
the Muses sweetly sung.
The grass was sweet, the trees full fair,
and lovely to behold,
and full of fruits was every euerytwig,
which shinde like glistering gold.
^y cheerful heart desired much
to taste the fruit so fair:
^ut as I reached, a fair young man
to me did fast repair.
^ouch not (quoth. he) that is none of thine,
but wend and walk with me:
and mark full well each several thing,
which I shall show to thee
^ wondered greatly at his words,
(...) went with him away:
(...) on a goodly pleasant bancke,
with him he bade me stay.
^ith branches then of Lillies white,
mine eyes there wiped he:
^hen this was done, he made me look,
what I far off could see.
(...)ooked up and lo, at last,
I did a City see:
(...) fair a thing did never man
behold with mortal eye:
^f Diamonds Pearls and Precious stones
it seemed the walls were made:
^he houses all with beaten gold,
(...) tilde and ouer-laid.
(...) brighter th^n the morning Sun,
(...)e light thereof did show:
(...) every creature in the same
(...) crowned Kings did go.
(...)lds about the City fair,
(...) all with Roses set:
Gilli flowers and Carnations fair,
which canker could not fret:
And from these fields there did proceed
the sweetst and pleasantst smell,
That ever living creature feit,
the sent did so excel:
Besides such sweet triumphant mirth
did from the City sound,
That I therewith was r^uished,
my joy did so abound.
With music, mirth, and melody,
Princes did there embrace:
And in my heart I long to be
within that joyful place.
The more I gazed, the more I might,
the sight pleased me so well:
For what I saw in every thing,
my tongue can no way tell:
Then of the man I did demand,
what place the same might be:
Whereas so many Kings do dwell,
in joy and melody?
Quoth he, that blessed place is heaven,
where yet thou must not rest,
And those that do like Princes walk,
are men whom God has blessed.
Then did I turn me round about,
and on the other side,
He bade me view and mark as much,
what things are to be spide.
With that I saw a coal black den,
all ^and with soot and smoke
Where stinking brimstone burning was,
which made me like to choke.
An v^ly creature there I saw,
whose face with knives was slasht,
And in a Caldron of poisoned filth,
his ugly corpse was washed
About his neck were fiery ruffes,
that flamed on every side.
I asked, and lo, the young man said,
that he was damned for pride.
Another sort then did I see,
whose bowel; Uipers tore:
And grievously with gaping mouth,
they did both yell and roar.
A spotted person by each one
stood gnawing on their hearts:
And this was conscience I was told,
that plagued their envious parts.
These were no sooner out of sight,
but straight came in their place,
A sort still throwing burning fire,
which fell against their face.
And ladles full of melted gold,
were powered down their throats:
And these were set (as seemed to me)
in midst of burning boats:
The for most of the company,
was Judas I was told,
Who had for filthy lucre sake;
his Lord and Master sold.
For covetousness those were condemned
so it was told to me,
And then, me thought another ^out
of Hell Hounds I did see:
Their faces they seemed fat in sight,
yet all their bones were bare,
And dishes full of crowling toads,
was made their finest fare.
From arms, from hands, from thighs and feet,
with red hot pincers then,
The flesh was plucked even from the bone
of these vile g^uttonous men.
On coal black beds, another sort,
in grievous sort did lie,
And underneath them burning brands,
their flesh did burn and fry.
With brimstone fierce their Pillows,
whereon their heads were laid,
And fiends with whips of glowing fire eke,
their lecherous skins off flaid.
Then did I see another come,
stebb'd in with daggers thick:
And filthy fiends with fiery darts,
their hearts did wound and prick:
And mighty bowls of corrupt blood,
were brought them for to drink,
and these men were for murder pla^u'd,
from which they could not shrink.
I saw when these were gone away,
the Swearer and the Liar,
and these were hung up by the tongues,
right over a flaming fire.
From eyes, from ears, from nauill, and
and from the lower parts,
The blood, me thought did gu^^^ng run noses
and clodded like men's hearts,
I asked why that punishment,
was upon Swearers laid:
Because, quoth* one, wounds, blood and heart^
was still the oath they made.
And therewithal from ugly Hell,
such shriekes and cries I heard,
As though some greater grief and plague
had vexed them afterward.
So that my soul was sore afraid,
such terror on me fell:
Away then went the yong-man quite,
and bade me not farewell.
Wherefore unto my body straight,
my spirit returned again,
And lively blood did afterward
stretch forth in every vein.
My closed eyes I opened,
and raised from my sound:
And wondered much to see my self
laid so upon the ground.
Which when my neighbors did behold,
great fear upon them fell.
To whom soon after I did show,
the news from Heaven and Hell.
FINIS.
