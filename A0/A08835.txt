The pain and sorrow of evil marriage,


Take heed and learn thou little child and se
That time passed will not again return
And in thy youth unto virtues use the
Let in thy breast no manner vice soiourne
That in thine aege thou have no cause to mourn
For time lost nor for defaute of wit
Think on this lesson / and in thy mind it shytte
Glory unto god / loving and benyson
To Peter and Johan and also to Laurence
Which have me take under proteccyon
From the deluge of mortal pestylence
And from the tempest of deedly vyolence
And me preserve that I fall not in the rage
Under the bond and yocke of marriage
I was in purpose to have taken a wife
And for to have wedded without auysednes
A full fair maid with her to lead my life
whom that I loved of hasty wylfulnes
with other fools to have lived in dystresse
As some gave me counseyle and began me to constrayne
To have be partable of their woofull pain
They lay upon me and hasted me full sore
And gave me counseyle for to have be bound
And began to praise each day more and more
The woofull life in which they did habounde
And were besy my gladness to confound
Themself reioysynge both at even and morrow
To have a fellow to live with them in sorrow
But of his grace god has me preserved
By the wise counseyle of these aungelles three
From hell gates / they have my life conserved
In time of war when lovers lusty
And bright phoebus was fresshest unto se
In gemynys the lusty and glad season
when to wedde caught first occasyon
My joy was set in especyall
To have wedded one excellent in fayrnes
And through her beauty have made my self thrall
Under the yocke of everlasting dystresse
But god alonely of his high goodness
Has by an angel as ye have herd me tell
Stopped my passage / from that peryllous hell
Among these aungelles that were in nombre three
There appeared one out of the southe
which spoke first of all to the trynyte
All of one sentence the matter is full couthe
And he was called Johan with the golden mouth
which concluded by sentence full notable
wives of custom ben gladly varyable
After this Johan the story says also
In confyrmacyon of their fragylyte
How that Peter called acorbylio
Affermeth plainly how that wives be
Diverse of heart full of duplycyte
Maysterfull hasty and eke proud
Crabbed of langage when they list cry aloude
Who takes a wife receives a great charge
In which he is full like to have a fall
with tempest tossed as is a besy barge
There he was free he makes himself thrall
wives of port ben full Imperyall
Husbands dare not their lusts gaynsaye
But lovely please and mekely them obaye
The husbands ever abides in travail
One labor passed there comes another new
And every day she begins a battle
And in complaining changes chere and hew
Under such falsues she fayneth to be true
She makes him rude as is a dull ass
Out of whose danger impossyble is to pass
Thus wedlock is an endless penance
Husbands know that have experyence
A martyrdom and a contynuaunce
In sorrow everlasting a deedly vyolence
And this of wives is gladly the sentence
Upon their husbands when they list to be bold
How they alone governs the household
And if her husband happen for to thryue
She says it is her prudent purueyaunce
If they go abacke ayenwarde and vnthryue
She says it is his mysgouernaunce
He bears the blame of all such ordinance
And if they be poor and fall in dystresse
She says it is his folly and lewdness
And if so be he be no werkman good
It may well hap he shall have an horn
A large bone to stuff with his hood
A mow behind and feigned chere beforne
And if it fall that their good be lorne
By adventure either at even or morrow
The sely husband shall have all the sorrow
An husband has great cause to care
For wife / for child / for stuff and meyne
And if ought lack she will both swear and stare
He is a wastour and shall never the
And Solomon says there be things three
Shrewde wives / rain / and smokes blake
Make husbands often their houses to forsake
Wives be beestes very unchangeable
In their desires which may not staunched be
Like a swalowe which is insacyable
Peryllous caryage in the trouble see
A wawe calm full of aduersyte
whose blandysshynge ends with myschaunce
Called Cyrenes ever full of varyaunce
They them rejoice to se and to be seen
And for to seek sondrye pylgrymages
At great gaderynges to walk on the grene
And on scaffoldes to sytte on high stages
If they be fair to show their vysages
And if they be foul of look or countenance
They it amend with pleasynge dalyaunce
And of profit they take but little head
But looks sour when their husbands ayleth ought
And of good mete and drink they will not fail in deed
what so ever it cost they care right naught
Nor they care not how dear it be bought
Rather than they should thereof lack or mysse
They would lever lay some pledge ywys
It is true I tell you young men euerychone
women be varyble and love many words and strife
who can not appease them lightly or anon
Shall have care and sorrow all his life
That woo the time that ever he took a wife
And will take thought and often muse
How he might find the manner his wife to refuse
But that manner with troth can not be found
Therefore be wise or ye come in the snare
Or er ye take the way of that bound
For and ye come there your joy is turned unto care
And remedy is there none so may I fare
But to take pacyens and think none other way about
Than shall ye dye a martyr without any doubt
Therefore you men that wedded be
Do nothing against the pleasure of your wife
Than shall you live the more meryly
And often cause her to live withouten strife
without thou art unhappy unto an evil life
Than if she than will be no better
Set her upon a lelande and bydde the devil fet her
Therefore think much and say naught
And thank god of his goodness
And prece not for to know all her thought
For than shalt thou not know as I guess
without it be of her own gentylnesse
And that is as much as a man may put in his eye
For if she list of thy words she cares not a fly
And to conclude shortly upon reason
To speak of wedlock of fools that be blente
There is no greter grefe nor feller poison
Nor none so dredefull peryllous serpent
As is a wife double of her intent
Therefore let young men to eschew sorrow and care
withdraw their fete or they come in the snare
