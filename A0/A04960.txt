(...) And tarried f^r his company
Which had not done so quickly
Although against his heart,
For when he saw a full platter
His mouth would straight run of water
Till he thereof had part.
Yet manerly he did refrain
Whereof his Wife was right feign,
To see him sit so quiet,
Though he unsatisfied did rise
And at supper likewise
By change of wonted diet.
The day was paste and night come,
Beede would feign have been at home
I know not well wherefore,
His wife swear by her head
That she would se the Bryde in bed
Before she ^ast the door (...)
(...) Brydegrome ^aide by Gods' m^
Cosyn you shall not go home to night
And thefore make no haste,
Beede did thank him heartily
Trustyng that more Furmenty
By tarieng he should taste.
When time was come conuenyent
Every man homewarde went
Which had been at the feast,
Saving some that ^ate Possettes
Whilste a few merye Gossypes
Brought the Bryde to rest.
One gave the bed a charm
Another was deuysynge harm
The third did scoole the Bryde
One would the sheets have sewed
Another Nettels would have strewed
Upon the Brydegromes side.
I can not tell how they agreed
But Mawde and her husband Beede
Were to their lodging led,
But Beede could no rest take,
His belly so began to ache
By hungry going to bed.
He turnde and tossed still in pain
His ^^f^e that would have slepte feign
He greatly did disease.
Who knew not what the cause was
How do you sir (quoth she) alas
Be (...) at ease?
Wife (quoth he) and dear lee^e
Thou never feltest the like grief
Of mine I dare well say,
It is of such extremytie
That if I have not remedy
(...) shall not live till day.
Sir (quoth she) then let me hear
that is the thing that does you dear
And what your help must be?
It is of such a qualytie
That nothing else but Furmentie
Can save my life (quoth he.)
By those words the wife knew
Whervppon the matter grew
And waxed full of sorrow.
Saying thus to him weepynge
Sir I pray you fall to slepynge
And suffer till to morrow.
For now you know they be not hot
Tell me (quoth he) where is the pot
I care not how they be
You do intend (quoth she) this night
To put your honesty to flight
As far as I can see.
For that (quoth he) care not thou
And like one made began now
To chase and threate her sore
Cryinge where is the pot still
At last (quoth she) with an ill will
Behind the milk house door.
Why then (quoth he) with merry chere
Let me alone if it be there
I will it find I trow,
Go closely (quoth she) then
I would not for my speckelde Hen,
That any should it know.
Up rose he then in his Shurte
Not doutynge Cold to do him hurt,
For nothing could him stay
He trod upon the ground soft
Gropynge for the door often
Before he came half way.
The door stood by the catch
Full saftely then he drew the latche
For fear of making noise.
And as behind the door he sought
The Ladle by the end he caught
Whereat he did rejoice.
From whence ear he did depart
Although a full half quarte
The Ladle would contain,
Six of them quyte of the swylde
To the brym with Potage fylde
To drive away his pain.
Though they wanted wholesome heat
Yet he swear, he never meat
Could like unto them find,
I pray God, much good do it his heart
And thus does end the second part
The best is yet behind.
The third part.
How Beede y^ would have brought his wife a Ladle full of Furmentie to her bed,
myste the way to his chamber, and how he kissed an old wives tail instead of
his wife. And how he bestowed The Potage where he had kissed.

BUt to make you understand
The thing that I have in hand
In plain and perfect sort,
I m^st by way of degression
Th^^ make to you expression
^herof did spring the sport.
This young man that so late
Was exalted to the estate
Of most honorable Marriage,
Did keep his wedding resydence
In the house of his Parents
A thing not rare in usage.
The old Father of the house
With his wife and honest Spouse
Though she were somewhat old
Had their lodging near bye
Where Beede and his wife did lie
As me mine Auctor told.
Whose chamber door open stood
Unluckyly that night by the Roode
As things fell after out
Which I intend to disclose
As I no less did purpose
When I went here about.
Though Fortune had been such a Friend
That Beede obtained in the end
His longed for reqest,
Yet now on him she began to frown
And turnde his luck quyte vpsydowne
Before she let him rest.
For when he was well satisfied
His anger then was mollyfyed
He was no longer wroth.
But like a loving and kind heart
Wysshed that his Wife had part
Of that so deyntie broth.
Wherefore a Ladle full he hent
And with them toward his wife went
When he him self was sped
Intending to have pleased her
Because he had diseased her
With tumbling in his bed.
But were it through to much have
Or whether that he were aghast
With ought he saw abroad,
I know not nether does it skyll
But well I wotte, he sped but ill
In caryage of his lode.
For as he like a Fox wylye
Passed toward his wife slylye
With the Ladle in his fyst.
He missing his own chamber,
Into the old folks Parler
He slipped before he wist.
Yet weenynge that he had been right
He went as warely as he might
And still that way did keep,
And forthwith in the same stounde
The aged couples bed he found
Where both lay fost a sleep.
And albeit there was no light
The Ladle yet he kept vpryght
And not a drop was spylde,
The old wife lay with her back
To him ward, whose Bum for lack
Of clothes did lie vnhylde.
Now Beede which did think he had Been at his own bed side, for glad
Did lay his loathsome lyppes
Full kyndly to the bare place
Supposing that his wives face
Which was the good wives hyppes.
Here is wife some Furmentie
(Quoth he) because so louyngly
Thou toldst me where they stood,
I never wist that any meat
Made of a little milk and wheat
Could have been half so good.
Taste of them here as thou lie
Puff (quoth she) and lanchte a fyste
The wind somewhat heddye,
Thou art unwise (quoth he) to blow
Syppe afewe and thou sholt know
They be cold enoughe already.
With that there blewe so great a gale
That would have made ones stomach quayle
It came with such a heat
Wife (quoth he) by my faith
He thynkes thou haste a sour breath
After thy Brydale meat.
And as he these words spoke
It seemed that her tacklynges brake
Wherewith atempest rose
For then the Thunderclaps did mutther
Rap, rap, one after another
Assendynge into his nose.
He waxed therewith very angry
As I could not blame him greatly
Being in such a case,
By Coxe lylly wounds he swore
If thou blow in them once more
I will cast them in thy face.
With that there came a sore crack
Inoughe to have made a shypwracke
Then Beede the Ladle took,
To daishe then he did not spare
The Potage on ver Buttockes bare
Wherewith the wife awocke.
And when she felt her buttockes wete
Her tail cleauynge to the sheet
Out and alas (quoth she)
Her husband a wooke therewith anon
In the name of God and saint John
What ayleth thee wife quoth he?
I am ashamde sir to tell it
I have taken such a surfeit
That I have playde the child
I pray you therefore hertyly
That you will take it patiently
For I am all befylde.
The good man gropynge to her huckles
Was by and by up to the knuckles,
Then he began to rail
Have thou ben at the potage pot
So often (quoth he) that thou can not
More better rule thy tail.
It chanced not thereby (quoth she)
Wylt thou tell me that (quoth he)?
For Scripture mention makes,
That it was through none other meat
For here enough does lie of Wheat
To make a couple of Cakes.
Could thou not from thy bed crepe,
I was quoth she so fast a sleep
I knew not of the deed,
When Beede did this debatynge hear
As one that had a flea in his ear
A way he went with speed.
The fourth part.
How Beede in returning to the pot with the Ladle again, prisoned on of his
hands in a Cream pot, and how he did chyde with his wife till she brake the
Ladle on his head, and won the mastrye of him with the loss of one of her eyes.

Though Beede his latter labor lost
His former pleasure, quit that cost
If that had ended all,
But as the Proverb does express
To sweet meat, a sour mess
Of sauce does often fall.
For as I said, he did not bide
To here the man and wife chyde
For that which he had done,
But stale a way with soft noyce
And did not at his luck rejoice
But made an inward moan.
For that he had so evil sped
Being by his folly led
Where he might shame have got
And where he on his full gorge,
Sustained such a sore discharge
Of hot and peryllous shot
And when he being thus bestadde
The milk house found again had
Which long he mased sought,
The Ladle then he did restore
Unto the Pot, from whence before
With Potage he had brought.
The Moon had then her perfyte light
And showen in at the wyndowe bright
That opened to the South,
Whereby Beede did soon espy
A Erthen pytcher standing by
Which had a mylky mouth.
And as it is a Glottens gyse
That whereupon he settes his eyes
That seems meat to be,
His stomach will begin to gnawe
Till part be in his gredy mawe
Of that his eye does see.
For in the Pot, that there stood
Was sweet Cream thycke and good
Which Beede did from the shelfe
Quickly take, and in it pryed
And what it was when he espied
He laughed to him self.
Saying mawgre all ill luck
He would thereat have one pluck
Before he thence did pass.
But Spoone could he none find
And suppynge was not in his mind
Wherefore he forced was.
Into the pot his fyst to thrust
To satisfye his gredy lust
And hoggysshe appetyte
But of his fyst the greatness
And the pottes mouth streatnes
Did mar his purpose quite
Because through hardely going in
There of, and chafynge of the skyn
Wwich was both hard and tough
The blood so fast into it fe^l
That sodaynely it began to swell
Then had he work enough
For out it would not come again
Though he and hour full or twain
Did struggle with it sore,
He wrange and wrested, pluckte and haylde
He feet and chafed, cursed and raylde
His hap he did deplore.
Wysshynge that the time and hour
That he from his own bower
Proceeded like a mome,
To se his wynes cosen wed
That he there with a broken head
Had kept him self at home.
And when he from his bed did rise
His hungry stomach to suffyse
To wysshe he now begyns
That the Thresholde of the door,
Had him tumbled in the floor
And broken both his shynnes.
His wife that a sleep had taken
In the mean while, was now waken
And when her Mate she mist.
In a musing mood she was
For how the world was come to pas
With him she little wist.
Yet thought she, by his long taryeng
That there had hapt some miscaryinge
And therefore was in dreede,
For she thought that verily
He had choked himself with Furmentie
Because he came not to bed.
Up she rose to go look
The way to the milk house she took
Where busylye God wot
Her Husband in his shryt she found
Barefoote on the cold ground
Wrestlynge with the pot.
Sir (quoth she) what do you mean?
Speak soft (quoth he) noughty queen
The Devil pluck out thy tongue
Then softely she again did say
What is the matter I you pray
That you have been so long.
But he was in such a rage
As one that should on a Stage
The part of Herod play,
That all in vain did Mawde speak
For he his fume did seek to wreake
And then began a fraye.
For a woman as you know
Can very ill abide a blow
And therefore in her mind
That Devil put it at the last,
The she should be no more aghast
To follow all her kind.
Which is to pay vsurye
For any kind of Injury,
By men unto them offerde
And Beede as I understand
A buffet with his emptye hand
To Mawde his wife then proferde
The which she took in ill part
Saying sir be shrewe thy heart
For (you) was come from home:
If thou do so much again
Thou Loute quoth she I tell the plain
I will dress the like a mome.
What (quoth he) even plain Loute,
Then is it time to look about
Your tawntynge will I charm
If I could from me discharge
This Cream pot, that I once at large
Might have my other arm.
But she like a subtle shrewe
His Cowardely Courage well knew
And therefore was she bold
T vomyte out her bitter bane
That all the train in Turn again lane
Might there have learnde to scolde.
Beede laid on with threats amayne
Mawde with tawntes replied again
For a word, she gave him five,
Bonayre and Bux^m was forgot
Then Beede saw it booted not
Against the stream to strive
And therewith all he did forbear
His hasty words and spoke her fair
Which put her in a Courage
To use with him such kind of play
That after till his dyenge day
He cursed his Cosynes Marriage.
For the more that Beede sought
His wife to silence to have brought
The louder still she crows,
And when her powder all was spent
Then vaylyauntly her self she bent
To fall to handye blows.
But Beedes fortune was so ill
His better hand yet being still
Within the Cream pot fast,
That about his balde noddle
To rap a good the wodden Ladle
His wife was not aghast.
Cryinge loud at every strype
I will the teach, thou greedy Grype
Good manner more to know,
The man had small defense God wot
Yet now and then with the pot
He warded well her blow.
But she laid one such lyll,
That he was forced against his will
That kind of ward forgo,
Or else in wylfull dyngynge stroke
The Earth Pot would soon have broke
And spylde the Creeme also.
So that the sely man was feign
Upon the Frontresse of his brain
To take his wives blessing,
Who quyte a sundre on his noule
At lengh did break the Ladle boule
Whereby she caught a dressynge
Though a piece that back did fly
And gave her such a blow in the eye
That refte thereof the sight,
And then to bed she went in pain
With more loss to her then gain
For all her cunninge fight.
The fyfte part.
How Beed brake the Creampot on a Freers head, and the Freer brake his fellows
head. And of the hurt and discommodytie that came through Beedes longyng for
Furmentie.

WHen Beede could se no remedy
But that of meare necessytie
The Cream pot must a sundre,
To find a place wheare he might
Work his purpose out of sight
About then did he blunder.
In the end he thought without the door
Was the fyttest place therefore
Sithe needs he do it must
Intending there by subtyle wit
To throw the sherdes into some pyt
And hyde the Cream he must.
Why do I stay, he got him out
To do the thing he went about
With have deuoyde of heed
But as it is an old Ryme
Have makes wast sometime
So did it ^hen by Beede.
For as asy^^^ he cast his eye
A dark corn^r he did espy
And thither him self he got,
Where a sleep lay two Friars
Balde almost to the ears
Upon a green plot.
Which two such manner vties
Had kept above their duties
Over even at the Marriage
And were so well entertained
That there they were both constrained
To take up their harbygage.
They had sucked such a Iuce
Out of the good ale Cruce
Wherein they found no dregs
That neither of them his head
Could carry home to his bed
For lack of better legs.
But there the selye fools
Lay slepynge in their Cooles
And bare headed was one
Which Beede did nothing mark
But at a blushe in the dark
Did take it for a stone.
Whereupon the pot he struck
So hard that it in pieces brake
Then was he well apayde,
But when he saw what he had done
He whypte away to bed soon
And nothing thereof said,
The Freere awaked with the blow
And can upon his own fellow
That still lay fast asleep.
Saying knave, why do thou so,
I will requyte the or I go
Thy head I advise the keep.
And with a great pybble stone
He brake his fellows head anon
Who therewith up did starte
And said again unto the other
What does move the gentell brother
To play with me this part.
A good c^se there is (quoth he)
For that thou have so served me
As it no less appears,
Se quoth he then dronken Loute
How thou my brains have strycken out
Which run about mine ears.
The Freeres then to buffets fell
Who had the worse I can not tell
For no man was them by
But he that best of them sped
Was sure of a broken head
Or else I heard a lie.
On the morrow was there found
The Cream pot broke on the ground
A meruell in mine eyes
The Cream was run down the gutter
The Cook thereby for lack of Butter
That day did mar the Pyes.
The Ladle clefte a sonder was
And how all this should come to pas
The people mused sore,
The Furmentie was half eaten
The milk Maid was shrewdly beaten
For lockynge not the door.
The old woman to her pain
In such a humble broth had layne
That on her heavy hyppes
The skin alas, was chased of
As broad I wys I do not scoff
As yonder young man's lyppes.
Mawde had upon her browe
Cawght a Clappe I told you how
Whereby she lost an eye
Men thought her husband Beede
That night in bed had done that deed
But there they went a wrye.
For beside many a knock
Which he of her in her smock
Had taken like a Daster.
He never while she was his wife
Could after live a quiet life
For still she would be master.
All these fore said chances ill
If Beede in head had layne still
Had not so hapte that day:
But now there was noremedye
For no man could for certainty
The fault to any lay.
Every man there at mused
But Beede first him self excused
Whom no man did suspecte:
But when his mylkye sleeue was spyde
Which like a fool he could not hyde
The matter was detecte.
Home therefore he went in have
Not taryenge for his break fast
Nor yet the Bryde to thank,
His wife took more leisure
And went after at her pleasure
A shamed of the prancke.
Yet like an honest woman she
Took her leave, so did not he
Of thanks she made no spare,
Desiring God to send them joy
And then God save her and saint Loy
She called for her Mare.
And thus of that Matrymonye
Did end the great Solemnytie
Where to so many fell,
Such hurt and discommodytie
Through a poor mess of Furmentie
That all that yet do dwell.
Within the Coast of Cumberlande
That did the Process understand
Will speak ye at of that Feast,
But let them talk and say their fill
For I have said all that I will
And therefore here I rest.
