blasphemose Book gatherid by D. Steph. Gardener / of late Lord Chauncelar / D.
Smyth of Oxford / Pighius / and other Papists / as by there books appears and
of late set forth under the name of Thomas Martin Doctor of the Civil laws
(as of himself he says) against the godly mariadge of priests. Wherein diverse
other matters which the Papists defend be so confutid / that in Martyns
overthrow they may see there own impudency and confusion. BY JOHN PONET Doctor
of divinity and Busshop of Winchester. Newly correctid and amendid.

The author desires that the reader will content himself with this first book

Cap. 1. That Martyns book is unmeet to be d^^dicatid to a Queen. Cap. 2. An
examination of the titell of Martyn book wherein is prouid by sundry rea^sons of
the scriptures and auncean^ doctors / that the mariadge of priests after
priesthod is not only a mariadge but also lawful and godly. Cap. 3 The
beginning of Martins first chapter is confutid / and his sleyghts in m^^king
false grounds disclosid. Cap. 4. That the hypocrisy of the papists has and
does deceive all men contrary t^ Martyns assertion etc. Cap. 5. Of the good

The book to the papists.
Ye Papists, peruse me in no wise trougheout
Before ye refuse me, and judge me to fire.
Lest ye should excuse ye, and say, lo no dout
These new men misuse ye, for we much desire
That they would make answer, but answer they can not.
They speak not, they write not, for answer they have n^
The books frind to the book.
Speack on and spare not, and fear not the fire.
if fire say we shall not make answer with pen,
Thou shall see the papists want that there desyer.
The printer does promis, for two copies tenn.
wherefore let their fury, ^royle, burn, and spare not
They shall not lak answer, though they brag we dare no^

And also it may be that then mine aduer^aries / whose delight is in evil

mean off his ^llegacions and reasons that he would se^e to make / but his

The first Chapter: That Martins book is unmeet to be dedicated to a Queen.
FIrst touching the tytell and preface of your book your intent is Martin (as
it apeareth by the same) to prove that the mariadge of priests and professed
parsons is not only a thing altogether unlawful: but also that there mariadge
is but a thing pretensid and indede no mariadge. And you think you have made
so witty a discourse / and so profound a resolucion / in this so weghty a
matter / by your clarkly wisdom: and Sophistical cu^ninge / that you can
find none so worthy a patron / to whom ye may dedicate the first fruits of
your fantasy as not only to a Queen / but also to a virgin Queen / as by the
end of your preface more plainly apereth. Martins filthi and unchaste talk in
his book dedicated to the Queen.
Not doutinge belyke the offending of her graces ears with your ungodly and
unchaste beastlynes and raylinge. As when you use the terms of detestable
bawdry / of stinkinge lechory / of beastly bichery / of concubines and of
common strumpets / of lecherose and filthy beasts / and of your heathenishe
ruffianlyke / and abominable talk in abusinge the words Carnis
res^rrectionem. Martins beastli abusinge of a piece of the creed in his book,
fol. lxvij.
.i. the resurrection of the flesh / being a necessary article of every
Christian man's faith / to the stirring up of nature in man's body / neither with
an infinite number / of such like and more wicked terms / with whose
rehersall I am more then ashamed to occupy my penn / but th^^ ^t is meet your
lewdnes should some thing be known and disclosed. Neither do you think belike
that she would be offendid with your shameless shifts / under the protection of
her name / nor with your euydent wrasting of the truth / and most manifest and
open lies / as well upon the holy and sacred Word of the euerliuinge god / as of
the learned fathers / and aunce (...) writers / and old Can^ons in the church
of god / of which lies / flaunders / sleig^tes / wicked / and ungodly
raylinges ^nly and of nothing else / the whole bo^y of your book is raked up
together as (...) stinking dunghill that is heaped of ^undry soartes of filth.
Oh lord / is ho^estie so much deca^ed / that any man dar^th be so bold to
occupy the chaste ears of any Christen creature / but chefely of a Queen with
such whorishe and ethnicall talk? whither has thy boldness carried the Martyn?
See thou not / that shame has not made the shrynke / to seek for defense of
thy beastlynes at the hand of the chief power? No man lyuinge (that conceaueth
good opinion of her grace) can think other wise / then that either she never
red thy book / or that she will not suffer thy boldness to go unpunished. But
be it that she would / yet assuer thy self of this / though she of her favor
toward the / will wi^k at thy wickedness / say what thou shall / yet will God
and all godly learned men / ouerloke both the and thy doings / and know by
that thou say what manner of man thou semest to be / and judge by that thou
should say / what manner of man thou ought to be. Thy book has betrayed
the Martyn / for thy fondnes / was not known before it came abroad / but as soon
as that showed it self in men's hands / they might easily perceive / Martin used
^erely to play the fool at Christmas in new College in Ox^^^d.
that in playnge the Christmas lords minion in new college in Oxford / in thy
foles coat that thou did learn thy boldness / and lost thy wit / and began
to ^ut of all shame and to put on all impu^encye. Thus being indewed with the
^ery properties of Martion the aunce ^nt Archeretique / and enemy to all
Matrimony (with who^e though thou ^gree somewhat in name / yet is that
agre^ent much more in opinion (as in pro^es by Gods grace I shall plainly
pro^e) thou think thou may play thy ^arte abroad now / as thou did at
ho^e then. But when thy folowers and ^auorers shall eftsoon perceive / that
^hey shall be accessory to thy folly / if thy ^olours being disclosed / they
continue in ^attery of thy doings: Then shame / if ^hey be not past shame /
shall make them ^^rynke from the / and drive them to la^ent both their own
case and thine / for ^^ffering affection so to blind their ey^s / that amongst
so many wise men ^hey have folwed such a fool. None that ^^ueth the Queen can
think that she co^ld read thy book without blushing chee^es / wherefore reason
seems to say that ^auinge no leisure her self / she causid thy ^ok to be
perused by so^e other / apo^ whose ^^porte if they were ho^est me^ / and not
her ^^atterers / or thy folowers (as many of them be that remain about her)
thy bo^^ke should never have been allowed / for ^^uoyding rebuke that thereby
might re^^ound to her grace herafter: Orels if (...) pleasure were that this
evil argumen^ against the holy matrimony of preste^ should go abroad vnd her
defense / the then the same / though it be an evil m^^ter / should have as
good a visor put apo^ it as might be / and that in such sort a^ though the
world that now is / may pe^^ceaue how by zeal s^e is carried to fa^^
superstition / The Queen ought to ^a^e heed of filthi ^pirits.
yet that the posterity which shall follow this age might vnderstan^ she
reioiseth not in such vile and filth^ spirits / though lyeng were allowed
(...) reason of her ignorance. In this (...) all other things her grace may
do wh^ it lusts so far and so long as God (...) permit and suffer / but
your raylings (...) lies may not be left untouched / thoug^ your book were tenn
times dedicate to Quee^ / lest through your falshod and ly^ truth it self
might either be hyd or hurt^

Wherefore I will presently turn my (...) from your preface to the tytell off
your (...) / for your preface is nothing else (...) paper full off poison
prepared to infect ^rinces ears. The matter therein con^yned I will differr to
be answered in ^he body of my book / where it shall be eui^ently declared that all
your promesses ^ere made be lies / all your reasons ray^ngs / all your wisdom
wranglinge / and ^ll your doings / deceytfull.

The Second chapter. An examination of the tytell of Mar^^ns book / wherein is
proved by sundry ^easons of the scriptures / and ancient Doctors / that the
mariadge of priests after priesthod / is not only a mariadge / but also is
lawful and godly. Martin promesseth much but performs nothing.

THe tytell of your bok is not unlike to a Tauerners wine bushe hanged out for
a show / where there is not one ^rop of wine / or at the least way of no ^ood
wine in the Cellar. For as the bus^e makes the people believe / that som^hat is

perceive ^^at no one thing in the whole book is ^ewly performed / that
gloriosli in the ^yttell of the same without fear is pro^essed. The trial
whereof shall be proved in my process. But one thing in thi^ first frunt I may not
well omit / because in your Tytell of your book it is so n^^toriose / and in
your body of the same / (...) whit remembered. whereby it may appe^^are how true
you be of your promesses the tytell of your book says that it is. The Tytell
of Martins book


A Treatise declaringe and plainly pr^^uinge that the pretensed mariadge (...)
priests and professed parsons / is no m^^riadge but altogether unlawful / etc.

Note good reader that Martin saiet^ not only that the mariadges of preest^ be
evil and unlawful mariadges / bu^ he says plainly that they be no
mariad^ges. That the mariadge of priests be not only mariadges but also good
and lawful.
I pray you master Doctor (if ^ may be so bold with you) answer me b^ your law

Secondarylye. If the mariadge of (...) priests in England were no mariad^^
then is there divorce no divorce: for if (...) a mariadge and a divorce it
follows (...) they be all gods enemies who either (...) or suffer in England
priests (...) to mary again other huszba^ds (...) the divorce is not for
adultery.

Thurdly You popish Heretics say that mariadge is a Sacrament of (...) new
Testament though in deed it were ^^^stituted in paradise before Adams
tr^^^^gression / Martin seems not to agree with the rest of the papists.
and therewith also you maint^^^ne and defend that Sacramenta conferunt (...) ex
opere operato. the Sacraments (...) grace by vertew of the work w^^^ught. And
upon that ground ye Christ bells / D. st^ksley bus^^p of london Christenid a cat

But if this being (as ye (...) it) a Sacrament of the new Testam^^^ and

/ then should not Sacraments confe^^ grace ex o^ere operato.i. by the work (...)

in the which words ((...) own wyue (...) man can deny / but by Gregorius
judgment the mari^^^ of a priest was a mariadge.

Item Pope Martyn being 647. after Christ says. Tanta est uis in Sacramento
Coniugij, Mariadge made after the vow must be kept though the vow be broken.
ut nec ex uiolatione uoti potest dissolui ipsum coniugium:

So great a strenght is in the Sacrament of matrimonye that the mariadge can
not be dissolved after the breche of the vow. Epiphanius a greek writer against
Martin 375. year after Christ.

Note the terms reader ^ecundum legem a votary may take a wife according to
the law.




Item Epiphanius contra Catharos haeresi 59. speking of them that have made a
vow / and afterward turn to mariadge / says.

Melius est lapsum a cursu palam sibi uxorem sumere secundum legem, and sic
rursus ad Ecclesiam induci, uelut qui mala operatus est, qui lapsum and
fractum, and obligatione opus habent^m, and non quotidie occultis iaculis
sauciari ab improbitate quae ipsis a Diabolo infertur.

Yt ts better (says he) for him tha^ is fallen in his course (meaning them
that can not continue in the thing that they have vowed) to take a wife openly
according to the law / The mariadge of a priest made after his vow is good.
and so to be restored to the church again (as one that before has done evil
/ as one that has fallen / and has been broken / and has now need to be
bound) and not daily to be inwardly wounded by secret darts where with the
deuell continualy does assault them. Lo here Epipha^. does (...) only allow
mariadges of priests and vot^^ries before priesthode and vowinge / bu^ also
after priesthod and vowing / and names the mariadge done in such case lau^full
/ and that mariadge after there vow (...) broken / is a mean to restore them
again to the church / if they were fallen from (...) by breakinge of there
vow. So that yo^ se by Ep. judgment / that the mariadge of priests even after
there vow is not only a mariadge but also a lawful mariadge. mariadge after
the vow is law full by Epiph.
And this place of Ep. answers fully a^ other places of him which by Martyn
and other Papists be wrythed to the con^trary. Item Saint Austen in his book de
bono uiduitatis makes a plain resolution in this matter as well against Marti^
/ as against all the rest of the popish rout in Christendom / where speaking
of the^ that mari after they have vowed / he says in plain words / Non ipsae
nuptiae uel taliu^ dam nandae iudicantur / (that is) the mariadge even of such
as marry after they have vowed are not to be condemned. Saint Austen against
Martin / falsified by Pighius.
This place of S. Austen is falsified by Pighius controuers.15. where for ( uel
talium he has crafftily put in ( uelut malum) wherapo^ the whole matter
stands. Oh false papist. And a little after S. Aug. says. Proinde ^ui talium
nuptias dicunt non esse nuptias, That the mariadge after the vow broken is a
good mariadge plainly proved by S. Austen.
sed poti ^s adulteria, non mihi uide^tur satis accurate and dili genter
considerare quid dicant, fallit quippe eos ^imilitudo ueritatis etc. and
shorthly after he says. Fit autem per hanc minus consideratam opinionem, qua
putant lapsarum a sancto proposi^o foeminarum, si nup^erint non esse coniugia,
no^ paruum malum, ut a maritis separentur uxores quasi adulterae sint, non
uxores: and cum uolunt eas separatas, reddere continentiae, faciunt maritos
earum adulteros ueros, cum suis uxoribus uiuis, ali as duxerint etc. The
English of all this together is this. Saint Austen says that the Papists know
not what they say.
wherefore they that say the mariadge of such (mea^ing of them that marry after
they have vowed) is no mariadge but rather adultery / me seems they do not
advisedly and diligently enough consider what they say / for they be deceived
by an appearance of truth for by the means of that folishe opinion whereby they
think the mariadge of such professed women as have forsaken there vow / is no
mariadge if they mary / Here be Martins very words confuted by Saint Austen
there comes no small inconvenience. which inconvenience is this wives be
separate from their husbands as though they were whores and not wives. And
when they will restore the divorsed to sole life / there husbands are compelled
to be very adulterers / when th^re own wives being alive they marr^ other
husbands. Here thou see Marti^ co^futid by S. Austens own words Wh^^che Saint
Austen says they be deceived which hold opinion that priests or vo^a^ies may
not many.
for satisfinge of such as think we have nothing in the old Doctors that
makes for our purpose. But one thing I pray the gentle reader / before thou
forsake this piece off Saint Austen Consider how earnestly in this my
allegacion Saint Austen charge our adversaries with dulnes and ignorance /
Consider how he tanteth them as talkers they wot not what / Consider how in
plain words he says they be deceauid.

And when thou shall read or hear them bring in Saint Auste^ against us /
set the reason of Saint Austen to make them answer / and if they will not /
with this reason be satisfied: Then let them harken to Saint Austen where he
says they be unlearned and without aduiseme^t / and that they say they wot not
what.

Now leauinge the confutacion of Martin any further in this point by auncea^t
counsels and Doctors / I have thought good to confute him also by the sacred
scriptures of God. Out of which one or two reasons / shall suffice for this
present because habundance off matter otherwise has made me tarry so long about
so little. 11.1. Tim. 4.


Saint Paul 1. Timoth. 4. speaking of mariadge and meats says thus. Martin
confuted by the scrip^ture.
Every creature of God is good to the faithful and none is to be refused being
taken with thanks geuinge / for it is sanctified by the word off God and prayer.

This mayor or ground we have have of Saint Paul / whereunto I add this minor
or mean proposition. But mariadge is a creature of god / that I am suer you
can not deny / onles you will say mariadge is a creature of the deuell as the
old heretics Saturninus Basilides and there folowers did. The heretics
Saturninus and Basilides were enemies of mariadge read / Theod. lib 1. de
Haereticis fab*
Whereupon must follow this conclusion / Ergo mariadge is good and not to be
refused being taken with thanks geuinge for it is sanctified by the word of God
and prayer. This sound Sylogismus proves plainly that the mariadge of a pressed
is not only a mariadge / but also a good mariadge / and a 2. Tim. 3. Tit. 1.
Yea and Saint Paul calls the bushop / priest / and deacon / by the name of
huszband / and there iokefellowes 1. Corinh. 7.
And further he says for the avoydinge of fornieacion let every man have his
wife etc. mariadge be honorable in all estates / as Saint Paul writes to the
hebrews the 13. Chap. Heb. 13*
And I pray you what neded you to make more ado / if priests mariadge were no
mariadge? what neded an act of Parliament / in the first year of the Quee^s
reign to repeal the statute made for priests mariadges? And why does that act
name it the mariadge of priests / and not a prete^sed mariadge / as you
doereuokynge the mariadges by the name of mariadges / and not of pretensed
mariadges? And last of all / if prests mariadge be no mariadge as you say: what
cause I pray you had the Queen and the bushopes to deprive the married bushopes
and priests of England from there benefices? They were not deprived for
ignorance in Gods word / neither for not doing there dewtie / nor for
glut^ony / nor swearinge / nor diszing / nor huntinge / nor buggery / nor
whoredom / for these be common faults amongst all your priests now a days /
And a benefice and any of them / or all of the^ be so compatible / and may so
well be enjoyed together / that any popish priest may quietly have those faults
an^ there benefice together wthout deprivation. Other fault there is none
known / but only that they were married / The married priests of England were
deprived without a cause.
though for the lawfulnes of there mariadge besyds Gods plain word and godly
Cannons and Doctors / etc. They had the consent of the king the supreme head
under Christ of the church and of the parliament and realm / an d that oyned
with the consent of the congregacions assembled where they were married / and
for the testimony of the kings consent and others both of the nobles and
commons / The married priests had the consent of the King the Parliament / and
the Realm.
for lawfulnes thereof / many of them receauid benefices after they were married
/ at the kings and other nobles hands. All this lawfulnes notwithstanding I
say other cause have ye none wherefore ye depryued the priests of England from
there benefices but only that they were married.

Now cum you forth and say that the pretentid mariadge of priests is no
mariadge. wherefore it must follow that the pretendid cause in England of priests
diuorsement is no cause / and that the priests be put from there livings
without a cause / even by your own supposall / if the maadge of priests be but
pretensid (as you put it) how much more then without a cause / being very
mariadge in deed? as is prouid / and without controversy amongst men of
knowledge / and vnder^andinge / even of your own sort / as is be ^re showed: If
therefore without a cau^ / then be they / either way / both by your ^d supposall
/ and in very deed / the true posessours of there benefices still / though
^ther by ^iole^ce and extorsio^ enjoy the profets of there possessions. whom I
would should right well note that like ^s princes and rulers be subject to
chau^ges / and that death as soon knocks at ^he doer of the rich as of the
pooer: So a man's right dies not. And law in another world will charge the
transgres^or / The Papists be extorsioners.
though case in this world so flatter the conscience / that God is for gotton
and the flesh make full merry. what is extorsion? if this be not extorsion? to
put out of goods and livings one without a cause / and to thrust in another
without a just tytell? But all this cannot suffice you / on^es ye may please
your throat and ears / with cryeng out upon us / the^es / heretics and
Traitors / etc. When you have taken from us both our cuntry / our goods / and
most lawful possessions. Yea and all that we have sauinge God alone / whom
with his word ye have left to us / and driven away from you / to our comfort
and your eternal shame and perpetual infamy*

But to return again to the Tytell (...) Martins book / I think it
sufficientl^ prouid / that the mariadge of a priest (...) professed parson is a
mariadge (to the open shame of Martin and his fauorer^ as well by arguments
deduced out of God^ word / and manifest authorities out (...) old Doctors both
greek and Latin / and testimonies of the popes themselves and of there own
laws / as by the uery proc^^dings of the Queen and the bushopes i^ England in
these present days. And by the way also it may somewhat appear by the
judgment of Epipha^ius / and Saint Austen etc. that the same mariadge / is not
only a mariadge / but also good / laufull / and godly. which point I thought
requisite somewhat to touch in the beginning / for satisfieng of such as
either would gladly / but yet have no leisure to read all the rest of the process
folowinge* or else of such as would feign have there hunger easid with sumwhat
in the begininge / whereby the pain of expectacion for the rest might be /
though not utterly taken away / yet some part aswagid. Now will I search what
Martin says in his first chapter / which begins on this wise.

The third chapter. The beginning of Martins first chapter (...) confuted and
his slight in making false grounds is disclosed.
If the fellowship and company of a woman be in a spiritual man a mean to
perfect religion / etc. Martins words.
Because in your ^oke almost universally you abuse to a ^ronge sense / Martins
fleight in using words that man be diversely taken to a wrong sense.
sundry words which may ^e ambiguosly taken / and so by equiuoca^ion and
Sophistical deceyt deceive the ^eader / as the terms / Chastity / virgini^ie
/ mariadge / whoredom / heresye / here^^que / Lechory / Church / Traditionn /
Cou^^els / Doctors / universal consent / vows Judgment / Spiritual men /
Carnal men / and a great number of such like I ^halbe otenfymes forced for
the help of ^he vnaquaynted reader / (least he be car^ed away with such
Sophistical sleyghts and deceytfull practices into the opinion off you Papists
/): to open the same words by plain distinction / as place shall requy^^r /
that the falshod taught by the Papists and the Catholic doctrine taught by
and his Apostels and us / may more eui^dently she^ i^ self and apeare. wherein
th^^ughe I sha^^ s^mtyme travail more lar^gely then shall seem needful for
answe^^ yet dout I nothing but that I shall de^serue pardon of the reader /
because it sha^ by Gods help / not be without some pro^fet / for in this
discourse I mind not to i^^yn with Martin alone (being a man as (...) seems
altogether ignorant in divinity (...) not only the author but rather the
pen^er o^ this blasphemose book) but with all the of rest the popish sect /
who have been either his helpers in it / or maynteiners o^ the like heretical
opinions. After this aduertiseme^t / the reader shall note / that the common
practice of Martin and such as he be / The craft off you papists is to ma^e
false grounds and to w^yth the mind of the writers
is / to make the ground and foundacio^ of there reasons upon words and
sentences either of there own fantasying / using the^ as things allredy prouid:
or else wrythed far from the mind of the speaker and writer for the
maintenance of there ma^nifest heresies and blasphemies / which craft of
there is is both profittable and ne^cessary to be disclosed / Martin abuses the
name of a spiritua^^ man to deceive the reader.
wherefore in the ve^ry first beginning of this chapter I ma^ie not suffer
Martin to turn the name of a Spiritual man / away from all married men to the
only shaven and popish ge^^^acion. For the reader shall vnder^^^nd that all be
spiritual men which be with Gods spirit. Romans 8. 1. Corin. 2.
And he who has ^re habundance of Gods spirit is (...) ^pirituall. What is a
spiritual man*
Of a like ma^nor Saint Pau^^ ^peaking to the married sort in Rome as ^ll as to
the rest / said uos non es^is in carne, in spiritu: you be not in the flesh but
in (...) spirit: Iohann. ^.
And Saint Ihon in his (...) chapter names all to be spiritual (...) believe
in Christ / for flesh and blood not able to bring forth such a spiritual
(...). And if the outward admission were ^ble to make a man spiritual / than
(...) Judas and such like / who had the ^^^ward election (yet inwardly followed
(...) spirit of the flesh / Spiritual.
and the devil) be ^^rthyly called spiritual / But our Saui^^^ Christ
reasoning with Nicodem ma^^th a play^ proof by evident demonstra^^^n that only
such as be indewed with ^^ds spirit / Iohannis. 3.
be worthy of the name Spiri^^all / and that such as be no^ born of Gods ^^^rit
/ be not spiritual / but car^all. A married man may be a spiritual man.
And the same place the lord has given a ^^nnerall resol^tion that no man can
en^^^ the kingdom of heaven / (...) he become ^pirituall man / (...) be born a
new not on ^f water / but (...) of the holy (...). Wherefore if it were true
that the clar^^ that lack wives were the only spiritu^^ sort (as Marti^ here
takes it) the^ shou^^ all the married people as well Papists (...) other /
Martins doctrine robeth all married men of the spirit of god 2. cor. 6.
as well kings / Princes / as other al sorts / lose the benifite of
regeneracio^ and be excluded from Gods holy comfo^^ and being men not
spiritual (as Mart^ terms them) should be unmeet templ^ in whom gods
spirit might dwell / a^ finally unable to enter the kingdom heaven. But the
scriptures of God kno^ no such distinction between the spiritua^^ and the
temporal or worldly / as the P^^pistes have fantasyed and devised ther^to
increase amongst the people the cred^^ of ^heire shaven and wiueles generacio^
whom only they call spiritual where a^ they be only spiritual / secundum
quid / th^^ is notte in dead but abusiue / they be call^^ spiritual for their
aparell / and office / b^^ otherwise altogether carnal. But in th^^ point the
papists agree fully with the (...) heritiques named Massilia^s / The agremente
of the papystes with the heretics named (...).
or in gre^^ (...) who would not lay their hand to a^^ kind of labor / and
their reason was ((...) Theodoret witnesses / lib 4) because th^^ named them
selves (...) (that is (...) say) spiritual menn / excluding all go^^ ^enne
from that name (spiritual) as the ^apystes do. Martins reason runs (...)
as though that a man can not be a spi^ituall man who has a wife. Mart. holds
that mariadg^ uncleanness (...) temporalye. pe^s^^


Can such talk tend to any other end ^hen that mariadge is uncleanness even in
them that be no priests: you would think ^araduenture that no such absurdite
can ^asse Martins pen / but as ye shall find ^he same in sundry other places
so shall ye ^inde it specially in sense / as well in the 20 ^eafe where he
aleadgeth that mariadge was diswaded by Constantine: as in the ^8. leaf page 2.

Where he makes a loud lie of the scriptures inforcinge himeselfe to prove it /
Martin belieth the scripture.
by these words where he says. The scriptures call it in a married man
uncleanness to ^ye with his own wife. Saint Paul says Heb. xiii. the married
ma^s bed is clea^ and Martin says contrary that it is unclean.
By the which words ye may see what a lying beast Martin is / for it is
evident that the scriptures in the 13 to the Heb. do call the married ma^s beed
(...) an undefiled bed / a pure / a clean / and an unspotted bed and such a
bed / as a spiritual manne that is to say any manne who is endued with
Gods spirit (as I have declared may lie in. Yea such a bed as he must
and as he is commannded to lie in / All such as have ^^t the gift of (...) ^f

Paul b^^deth and charge sainge (...) the Imperative mode / (...). / If they
refrain not / them marry / or (as if he should say) I c^^maund them to marry.
Mat. xix. Ep. iiij. j. Cor. vij.
Which comma^^dement is not given by Saint Paul such men as have cast away
the fear God / but to such as be indewed (...) Gods spirit / and therefore
spiritual^ Howbeit as no one spiritual man has (...) spiritual gifts / but
eueryman has (...) proper or several gift of God / this (...) thus / and
another man otherwise: so hat^ not every spiritual man the gift of (...) life
as Christ witnesses Matthew. 19. (...) for that cause is the holy state of
matrim^^ny ordained / that such as have not the gift of virginity may live in
that hol^ state / without departing from the perfec^tion of a Christen man.
Which saying se^^meth to Martin a great absurdity. (...) Saint Paul (ye see
by his commaund^ment) is of this mind. Clemens Alexandrinus (...), li. 7.
And Clemens Al^^^a^drinus (who wrote about 220 years afte^ Christ (descrybing
the parfect Christian (...) spiritual man / says among other proper^ties /
(...). that is that (...) does eat / and drink / and marieth a wi^e: and for a
proof of his saying he adds / Mariadge is cleannes.
that the perfect Christian may boldly / ma^^y (...) for as much as ^e has
(says he) The Apostles for his example / The Apostels had wives.
Signifieng and declaring thereby both the cleanes of mariadge and that the
Apostels had wives. And the uery same sayng in effect he has in his third book
of the sa^e argument / whose uery words as they be written in grek I will
differr until another place where they shall serve this as well as other
purposes. In this matter more profes be not requisite / consideringe the
clearnes of this doctrine agrees fully with the preachinge of the most
aunceant Doctors and writers / whom Martins railing tongue accusing us /
calls with us / new procedinge preachers: And yet somewhat more then needs is
not vnnedefull for such as be so far gone as nothing almost will bring them
back again / whom I would therefore should harken a little further.

If a man should demand of S. Paul why he gave this com^aundeme^t of mariadge
to such as had received gods spirit and have not the gift of sole life? Can
(...) think he would make any other answer (...) that which he has already
made? ^. Corin. 7.
whi^^ is melius est nubere quam uri.i. it is better mary then to burn? Martyn
is against S. Paul.
whereupon it folowe^ that Saint Paul's judgment is contr^^ry to Martyns: for
by this his answer it plain that the fellowship and company (...) woman is a
mean to a spiritual man ^^stey him in the perfection of Christ's reli^^^on.
Mariadge helps the godly man that has not the gift of sole life to the state
of perfection.
And that a single and a wyueles ly^ to such men as have not the gift of
abstin^ence / is not a mean to continue the spirit^^all man in the same
perfection / but rathe^ a means to bring him to burning and de^struction: And
it must also follow / that (...) the second part of Martins first condici^onall
/ he makes a loud lie / sainge. If the fellowship and company of a woman be
(...) a spiritual man a mean to perfect religi^on / etc. Then Christ's holy
Apostels and the aunceant fathers of the church hau^ taught us a wrong
doctrine. For it is pro^uid both that the company of a wife or (a^ Martin
frowardly terms it) of a woman is a helping mean to make that man perfect in
religion who being without a wife and laking that gift / Genesis ^.
has an imperf^tion Of this doctrine almighty God is a witness saying / let us
make to man a helper: Martyn holds that God made to him a hynderer. And that
this is no wrong doctrine but a true taught by Christ and his apostels: Thesome
of that I have said may be knit up in this brefe reason thus. Saint Paul (as
Ihaue alleged) gave such in commandment / as cold not absteyn / to marry. A
Syllogism
But S. Paul commaundid nothing that might hiner the perfection of a
Christian man's religion. Ergo mariadge is no hinderaunce to the perfection of a
Christian man's religion.

Yet then proceeds Martin further on the other side / Martyn be^yet the
preathers in king Edwards days.
beginning with a (but) and proceeding with an (If) inferring consequently two
suppositions / and would thereby induce the reader first to believe that sum in
England have taught in king Edwars days the som^e of our religion to stand in
wiuing. And then secondaryly he says that Christ allowed such as absteyn from
mariadge though they have not the gift. What some have taught I can not say
but this I am able to say / that it was no doctrine generally allowed / Therefore
because both the suppositions be most manifestly false it may well appear that
Martin and his fellow (...) seek nothing but matter whereupon (...) wrangle /
as the godly preachers in kin^ge Edwards days / sought nothing m^^re then to
set forth the plain truth and the lawful / and honorable Chasti^tie of
mariadge / how so ever Martin unchaste tongue / is not ashamed to babell*

And when he has raylyd a whyl^ even in the very beginning of his book then
he departs from suppositions to fayer and ^^at lyenge / lest all the body
being made of lyenge and raylyng should lack a head / like unto it self. These
be his words.

The fourth chapter. That the hypocrisy of the Papists has and does deceive
all men contrary to Martins assertion / etc.

IF a man will way the matter indifferently the opinion of such can employ no
suspicion of vntreuth / which which seek nothing but austeritie of life and
their own pain.

I marvel much that Martin is not ashamed to commend his fond opinion /

with the fained austeritie and sharpnes of the fat bellied Prie^^es whom he
would seem to defend. The whole study of the Papists is to increase there
plesures and to maintain belly fare.
All the world sees that there hole life is spent almost in nothing else then
in eating and drinkinge / in ydell walkinge and pastymes / and in prouidinge
for furringe of there bak / and fattinge of there belly / and in gorgeosly
deckid chambers / and soft slepinge. For maintenance whereof I report me to all
the world what pains they take in purchasinge pluralities / tot quots non
resydences / etc. that they may heap prebend upon prebend / and benefice upon
benefice / least at any time there back / or there belly / should lack of there
lust. Some papists win the har^es of the people with gluttonye.
Fearinge least there spare godly diet should cause there neighbors to call
them nigards

Knowinge that belly fare is a better means to win the hearts of the ignorant
and common people / then is the doctrine of the punishment of the body and of
the austeritie of life. And knowing also / that he shall be praised for good /
though he be never so evil / If he keep a great house (as they call it) and
^^ly good chere. I maruayle I say / bu^ whither does not impudency carry the
pa^pists? I pray the Martyn what kind of people have more deceived the world
then such as have colorid there naught^ines with austeritie of life / The
pre^ense of hard life has deceived all Christendom.
and seem t^ differ from other in outward state? The Phariseis / the Esseis /
and such like here^tiques / who trubled the church of God both before and in
Christ's time / who w^^re more commendid of the people for ther^ austeritie of
life then they? The practices whereby the old heretics gatther estimacion.
and who were worse? The aunceant heretics in the begin^inge of the church
for the most part did wyn^ there first estimation: some Ireneus.
Some (of whom Ireneus writes) that they abhorred mariadges / Speakinge
against mariadge / brought the old heretics in to estimation.
and absteyned from flesh / huiusmodi continentia seducentes multos.i.
seducinge many with such continency and refrayninge. And these were within
Montan 170. year after Christ. And nouatus 244. year after Christ / and many
other as hereafter I shall more largely ^eclare. Some by co^dempninge the
ma^adge Eustachiani: and all ^^e old heretics / whose example the Pa^ists do
follow: Epiphanius Her. xiij.
Some by fasting and ab^inence Epiph. Her.13. witnesses of Dotheus that he
fastid so much with bread and water in a cave in the wilderness that ^e pined
himself a way for lack of suffici^nt sustinance. Some by never speaking Saint
Austen de heresibus. Theodoret / de Hereticis fabulis:
And of these abstinences and straytnes of lyuinge differinge from all other
men of most sober and godly life / and How sundry heretics / ga^ sundry names
punishinge there bodies / many of these heretics had their names. As
Encratitae of abstinence / Apostolici / of there holiness / Pa^talorinchitae /
of silence / Flagelliferi of scourginge themselves / and Ieiunantes of fasting
and such like. Have not monks / friars / nonnes / hermets / recluses / and
anchors / and such other the Popes creatures who deceived all Christendom with
pretendinge austeritie of life / and there own pain?

Nothing is better to wynn (...) ^f the igno^a^^ ^^en (...).
Who knows not that no means is better to wynn the hearts of the ignorant then
superstit^on? Who knows not that by no means sooner the heart of the ignorant
is lost then by plain dealinge / plain speakinge / and truth? Does Martin
think that the Phariseis had preuailid against Christ / if the outward show of
there Austere and strayte life / had not made them seem in the eyes of the
ignorant more verteous then Christ and his Apostels? The Phariseis appearid to
the people ^olyer the^ Christ.
How a strayte life deceaueth the people it is in a bok ascribid to Saint Austen
plentifully declared in the 21. Sermon ad Fratres in Heremo speakinge amongst
other things of the heretics that were callid Sarabaitae / Saint Austen ad
(...) in ^eremo se^mo xxj.
and these be his words. Tales fuerunt illi Sarabaitae, de quibus nobis tertio
scripsit pater Hieronimus, quorum genus est omni affectu uitandum. Ipsi den^que
in Aegypto erant in foraminib. petrarum habitantes. Induti porcorum and boum
pellibus tantum, cincti funibus palmarum, spinas ad calcanea portan^e^, ad
cingulum ligatas, Discalceati and sanguine cruentati cauernas excuntes ad
festum scenopegiae pergebant Hierosolymam, and sancta ^^ctorum intrantes,
paupertatem and abstinenti^^ praedicabant, omni affectu seruare, Bar^^s
postmodum in conspectu hominum sine re^^mptione euellere festina^ant, and sic
acquisita fa^^a, and lucro, ad propria remeabant, solitary gau^ntes and
epulantes supra id, quod explicare pos^nus. Hos obsecro nolite imitari, and
caetera.

That is to say. The hypocrisy of the Heretics named Sarabaits sy^ to the
hypoc^i^y of the Papists.
Such were the Heretics callid Sarahaitae of whom ^ther Hierom has written
to us this ^hird time. Whose fashion is by all ^eans to be a voyded. They abode
in Egypt in caves of rocks / clothed only ^ith the skins of swyne and oxenn /
and ^ere gyrdid with withes of palm trees and being bare fotid they tied
thorns ^o there gyrdels which knockid and ^ricked them upon the heels / and
they ^ent out all blody to Jerusalem to ^he feast of Tabernacules / and
enteringe ^he holy of the holiest / they did preach ^he observation of poverty
and abstin^nce with all affection.

Who would not judge these men holly? They pullid of the hear of there beards
(...) the sight of the people / and so gettinge boeth fame and vantage / they
return^ home privily / reioysyng and banketing above measure. I would feign

there is nothing mo^^ perilous then straitenes of life. Wh^^ lecherose life led

mass caake. As Sir Thoma^ More witnesses in his dialoge. Wh^^ bawdry
practiced the holy? nay the deue^^she maid of kent / with Monks fryer^ and

and the Papists can ^ot deny / And they know well enoug^e themselves / that
there be of the like ^housands / which I omit for brefenes / that destroy

deuell by losenes of living / ap^eareth in his own form / he can not so

perfectly bro^ught to pass in all the orders of Anti^christ. Of Popes /

establishment of bug^gery of whoredom and of all ungodliness and to the
universal ruin of the true faith of Christ's true religion / and of all

the lawyer is become the devils Secretary / who being taught by his master ^
takes diligent heed throughout his book / that in no wise he give any kind o^
praise or commendacio^ to matrimony in any kind of people. Martins dyspraises
of matrimony in his book Fol Cxxiiij
But terms it sometime (carnal liberty) sometime (the basest state of life in
the church of God) sometime (a color of bawdry) sometime (tha^ it is a let for a

God him self witnessed when he said ^ciamus ei adiutorium let us make Adam
(...) helper. Gene. 2 Martin his abominable doctrine concerning mariadge
agreinge with Mo^tanus and Tatianus and such other heritiques.
And in the leaves.121. and 122. ^e goethe about to prove by Saint ^aule that
all men should avoid ma^iadge. Where by he confirms the o^inions of
Montanus, Tatianus / and such o^ther abominable heritiques.

And where as Martine for the maintenance of his Herisie / alleges Eusebius
speakinge of the Heritique Che^inthus / as though he had framed / or ^ather
writhed the Scriptures / for the maintinaunce of his incontinencye / which
stood as Eusebius says in eating and drinking and mariadge: Eusebius. li. v
Cap. xxviii.
Ye shall understand that neither Eusebius nor none other old authoure
speakinge of the herisie of Cherinthus do judge him to speak of the mariadge
in this life / Martin understands not Eusebius. Hiero. in Ezech ca. xxxvi.
Augu. de heresibus.
but that (as Saint Hierom more largelye declares upon the 36 Chapter of
Ezechiell / and Saint Austen de haeresibus And Eusebius in the same place
though more obscurelye then the rest) Cherinthus was (...). The opinion of
Cherinthus concerning mariadge in the life to come.


Whose opinion was that we should live in the earth pleasantly a 1000. years
not in these days / and before our death or before our resurrection / but
that after our resurrection we should eat and drink and marri / and cease from
offeringe bulls and ram^es and other sacrifices: with the which opinion Saint
Hierom in the same place charge Tertulian, Lactantius and Irenaeus and other
mani of the old fathers who w^^re not without their errors being men / that
Saint Hierom and the old writers declare that Cerinthus was not condem^pnid
for allowinge of lawful mariadge in this life / as Martin out of Eusebius
contrary to the mind of other Doctors would seem to prove / nor yet for
alowing of bawdry under the color of matrymony as his tongue most unhonestly
delyteth to term it. Theodoret lib ij (...).
But for that he taught a new earthly kingdom of Christ / and of a new
Jerusalem after our resurrection as Theodoret writes / wherein we should eat
and drink and marry / in the life to cum (I say) and not in the life present.
Whereby ye may easily judge how this allegacion makes nothing for Martins
purpose. Martyn confirms ^ne lie with another.
Which was also fearid (as it should seem) of Martin / and therefore he
confirms his matter with another lie saying.

And therefore Cerinthus made a general doctrine that men should satisfy there
fleshly prouocations by eating and ^rinkinge and marieng. This is one of
Martins shameless lies / for neither was that the opinion of Cerinthus (as I
have declarid) nether does the old writers ^o report it / so that in this place
Mar^ins lie is manifest. But one thing I shall desire the to note in this
allegacion that he reports not Cerinthus / to satisfy his fleshly
prouocations by eatinge and drinking and whoredom: But by eatinge and drinkinge
and mariadge. Martin seeks means how to bring the holy state of matrimony in
to contempt.
Whereby the reader may see that Martin would feign have mariadge allowed by a
general doctrine of Cerinthus the heretic / purposly wrything Eusebius from
the consent of the other oulde Doctors / that he might have some color thereby
to condemn mariadge / as a thing by some heretic approuid. Whereby thou
may learn good reader / that no doctrine is so false / no opinion so perelose
/ no blasphemy so horrible / but Martyn would admit it / so that he might
therbi hauesome help wherewith to bark against the mariadge of priests. And in
deed if he could bring the proof to pass that all mariadges were unclean and
wicked / as by this his allegacion of Eusebius he seems to intend then should
his conclusion easily follow A genere ad speciem uniuersaliter / that also the
mariadge of priests were unclean an^ wicked: but this mayor neither Marti^ /
neither never a papist that ever was / shalb^ hable to prove / Note therefore
good read^ how busilye Martin laboreth to gett^ him some majors / and grounds
/ for the maintenance of his wicked purpose. Which when he fyndeth good / he
failet^ in the proof of his minor or mean pro^posicion: and being false (as ye
se this is^ he not only leaseth his labor: but also shows himself what
an enemy he is to the treuth. when of purpose by vntreuthe he seeks the
maintenance of his deuelishe opinion. That Iouinian was not the f^rst
heritique that preached in Rome contrary to Martin.
And to amend this matter withal / by and by Martin comes forth with
Another lie / saying.

That Iouinian the monk was the first heritique that preached in Rome.

Another lie of Martin.
For if it be true that Peter was at Rome and disputed there with Simon Magus
as Eusebius, Epiphanius, Irenaeus, and other do witness.

And also that Simon Magus (docuit) taught there / as Iraeneus witnesses / and
further that he had so persuaded the Romans with his doctrine that they
raised up a pillar in his honor / with this writing upon it: Irenaeus lib. 2.
cap. 20.
Simoni Deo sancto / To Simon the holly God / as Eusebius / Theodoret / and
other do also testify / And moreover if it be true that Martio^ the heritique
preached at Rome in the time of Policarpus Busshop of Smirna 160. year after
Christ as Ieraenus witnesses / Irenaeus li. 3. cap. 3.
And also that Cerdo the heritique came to Rome in the time of Higinius 144
year after Christ as Eusebius witnesses libro quarto Cap. 8 Eusebius lib.
iiij. cap. vlij.


Item that Nouatus the Anabaptiste taught in Rome in the time of Pope Fabianus
255. year after Christ.

Item that Pope Liberius was an Arian in the time of Constantyne and preached
in Rome as Platina witnesses / Pope Liberius was an heretic. Platina.
If (I say) all these things be true (as they be of these old and credible
authoures reported) then must this be Another of Martins lies / for Iouinia^
was 400 years after Christ and long after these heritiques whom I have
aleaged as by the years does plainly appear. All these were before Iouinian
/ and heritiques / and at Rome / and preached or taught there. Ergo Io^inian was
not the furst. But if Martin would excuse himself by that which he adds (as he
says) out of Saint Hierom / as he pretends / and as by the note in the
margent it should seem that h^ would / That Iouinian the monk was the first
heretic that preached in Rome / that there was no difference betwixt
uirginitie and matrimony: Yet can not Mar^tin so save himself otherwise the^
one who for defending of his legs took a blow upon the face. For I assuer the
good reader this is as great a lie as the other / Yt is a lie I say that this
saying which Martin both by the text and note in the margent ascrybeth to be
said by Saint Hierom in the furst and second epistle unto Iouinian / Martin
falseli belieth Saint Hierom.
for it is in neither of them both / but is a matter of Martyns own forginge
and framinge / Though the thing it self be of no great importance / yet is it
not unneedful to show how shamefully / these Papists belie the old authors.

Martin yet can not thus be contentid but proceeds from one lie to annother.
Saying that The new superinde^ts (meaning the godli preachers in bleszid king
Edward the vj his days) taught all one doctrine with Iouinian. Another lie of
Mar^^ns.
Which was as Martin alleged out of Saint Hierom. ^ast seldom but marry often
for ye ca^ not ^onsummate the works of matrimony on ^es ye eat and drink
delicatly. Thou shall ^ote good reader / in this allegacio^ Mar^i^s ignorance
/ for he takes these words (...) spoken by Iouinian / when in deed ^hey are
but feigned of Saint Hierom and ^ronice obiectid to Iouinian / Martyn is
deceived by a paralogisme of S. Hierom. lib. ij. aduersus Iouinianu^ in fine.
as although this was not by him taught in play^e words / yet that it was
agreeable to his ^octrine. But Martin takes it as though it had bee^ Iouinia^s
own words. Note also that S. Hierom in this place ^peaketh not of the mariadge
of preests ^ut of second mariadges generally / obiecting to Iouinian as a
licentius and an ungodly doctri^e to teach the people that they might use second
and often mariadge. Sant Hierom was notid of his frinds as an enemy of second
mariadges / and makes an excuse for his so doing.
And this opinion of Saint Hierom was notid by his frinds / whereof after
advertisement he pourged himself in his Apology made for the same purpose. But
let us grant that these words were not feigned by Saint Hierom. I pray the
Martynn / how can thou be hable to justify that this was the Doctrine of the
preachers in England / whom contemptuosly thou call (superinte^dents?) Our
whole doctrine wherein we consentid touching ffasti^ge Prayer and Mariadge etc.
i^ plainly and fully set forth in the books o^ common prayers / The doctrine
set forth by the Preachers in England in writing proves Martin a liar
the Homelies the Cat^techismes and the Artickles wherapo^ the whole realm
concludid / If thou ca^^ find in these books any such doctrine than may thou
say that we agreed wit^ Iouinian in case he had taught such doc^trine. But if
thou can not find this do^trine / which thou say was Iouinian^ in those
books / then may we boldly sa^ that thou do falsely belie us. Our doc^trine
was not kept so secret / but that i^ was not only preached / but also printid
and so printid that it has the testimony of the whole realm. And is safly
enoghe preserved out of the hands of the proudest o^ you. Wherefore neither thou
Martin / no^ no man else ca^ misreporte us touching our doctrine but they shall
have both these bo^oks the acts of parliament / the subscriptions of the
clergy / yea and your own subscriptions / and the testimonies of the whole
realm against the^. And touchi^ge your lies that ye charg us / as teachers of
carnal liberty (which is thy whole intent in this place / there were sundry
special homelies / which shall be a witness that thou / and thy fellows be liars
as ^onge as thy book shall continue / ye as long as the World shall continue
/ though ye slander / rail and rage until your bellies brust in pieces / ye

thousand in a month.

The fifth Chapter. Of the good name superintendent / and of the names of
ministers deuisid by the Pope and his adherents / with the sum of Martins
reason contained in his first chapter.
ANd further whereas it pleasith martyn not only in this place but also herafter
to gest at the name of Superintendent / That Martin maliciosly gesteth at the
good name of superintendent.
he shows himself bent to condemn all things that be good / though in so
doing he can not avoyde his open shame. Who knows not that the name Busshop
has so been abusid / that when it was spoken the people understood nothing else
but a great lord / tha^ went in a white rochet / with a wide sha^uen crown /
and that carries an oil box^ with him / wherewith he uses o^ce in sea^uen
years rydinge about to confirm chi^dren / etc. Now to bring the people from
this abuse / what better means ca^ be deuisid / then to teach the people there
error by another word out of the scriptures / of the same signification? which
thing by the term (superintende^t) would in time have been well brought to
pass. For the ordinary pains of such as were called superintendents / should
have taught the people to understand the dewtie of there bushop / which you
Papists would feign have hidden from them. And the word (superinte^dent) being a
very latin word made English by use / should in time have taught the people by
the very etymology and and proper signification / what thing was meant when
they hard that name / which by this term Bushop / could not so well be done /
by reason that bushops in the time of Popery were overseers in name / but not
in deed. So that there doing could not teach the people there names / neither
what they should look for at there bushops hands. For the name bushop / spoken
amongst the unlearned / signified to ^em nothing lesze then a preacher of Gods
word / because there was not / nor (...) any thing more rare in any order of
^cclesiasticall parsons / then to see a busz^^op preach: Whereof the doi^gs of
the po^ishe buszhops of England can this day ^itnes / but the name
(superintendent) should make him ashamed of his negli^ence / and a frayd of his
ydelnes / know^ng that Saint Paul does call upon him ^o atte^d to himself and
to his whole flock / Act. xx.
Of the which sentence our bushops mark ^he first piece right well (that is) to
take ^ede to them selves / but they be so deaf that they can not herke^ to the
second (that ^s) to look to there flock: I deny not but that the name
(busshop) may be well ta^e^ / but because the euelnes of the abuse / has
marrid the goodness of the word it can not be denied but that it was not amiss
to join for a time another word with it in his place / whereby to restore that
abusid word to his right signification. And the name (superinte^de^t) is such a
name that the Papists themselves (sauinge such as lack both lerninge and wit)
can not find falt withal. The Papist Peresius part tertia aloweth the term
of superintendent.
For Peresius the spaniard / and an Archepapist / (ou^ of whom Martin has
stole^ a great part^ of his book) speaking of a buszhop says Primum Episcopi
munus nome^ ipsum praese fert, quod est superintendere: Episcopus enim
super^intendens interpretatur, uisitans aut superuidens^ that is to say. The
chief office of a bushop by interpretation / signifies a Superintendent /
Martyn has stolen common places out of Peresius the spanish Papist
a Visitor or an Ouerseer. Why did not Martyn as well steal this piece outof
Peresius as he did steal all the co^^mon places that he has for the proof of
the Cannons of the Apostels / and of Traditions in his second and third
chapters? And also the most part of all the authorities that be there patched
together / and most fasly and vnlernedly wrythed / from gods treuth out of the
general counsels and old writers through out his book. None be more blind
then they whose eyes be put out with malice. Martin in the lxxx^iij. leaf of
his book.
Martyn in the 88 leaf is not ashamed in his book to divide the
significatio^s of the terms (busshop) and (superintendent) as though the one
were not signified by the other.

But it may be that Martyn and the rest of the popish sect / would not have the
name of ( Superintendent) or Minister vsid / lest that name which did put the
people in remembrance of sacrifici^ge and bludsuppinge should be forgotten. The
Papists do study to drive men from knowledge to ignorance.
Blyndnes (...) ignorance is the rediest way to brin^e the heresy of the
Papists into estima^^on. wherefore when the people is most ^lynde / the^ shall
these heretics be most ^stemed. We Christians use no words nor ^earmes
commonly in setting forth the ^cclesiasticall ord of prayers or in the
mi^istration of the holy Sacraments / or in ^aming the ministers thereof / or of
any other thing thereunto belonginge / onles we have some ground of scripture
as well for the name / as for the thing. yet that not withstandinge / the
reader may see we can not avoid the byti^ge of there maliciose mouths. But I
pray the good read ^oke again on the other side / what a no^^^er of things and
names they have devised / and daily do devise / without any ground either of
God or of good men. The Papists find fault with the names diuisid by the holy
ghost.

The papists have no scripture for the defense of the names of there own
shauelings.


Oh how the Papists would triumph over us / ifthei had like proof for the names
and things of there diuisinge / for the names (I say) of Pope / Cardinal /
legate / suffragan / Cannon Prebendary / Monk / Non^e / Heremet / Anchor /
Chanon / ffryer / and all the rest of the vyprose generation and ofspringe of
the Pope / as we that profess Christ / have for the maintaince of the terms
and names of (Superintendent) minister^ Seniors / Elders / Brethren / and such
lik^ by us vsid? But this help of the scripture^ not withstandinge they lak /
yet is no^ Martin and his fellows ashamed to charge our names / which began
with the new Testament / with the reproach of newnes / geuinge to the names of
there own deuisinge / the praise of old Antiquity / though such names were
not known to the church of Christ / many hundredth years after Christ's
ascension. Wherefore thou may see good reader / that they abuse thine ears
when they say there doctrine is the elder / empeachinge our doctrine with the
reproach of newnes. And therewith thou may also perceive / that this is one of
there sleyghts whereby to beg of the / our discredit and there own estimation.
With which inconvenience I thought good to meet in the beginning / because
Martins railing pen is ever busy with this practice. Now to proceed / I will
rehearse Martyn / whiles he wandreth stryuinge to prove by sundry places of
Doctors patched together without either ground / or good order: that heresy /
and lechory be commonly joined together. Wherein I would not greatly have stand
with him if he would have dealt plainly / trewly / and syncerely. But he has
cast such a mist before the eyes of the reader with crye^g out (heresy lechory
thief and traitor) that no man lyuinge would judge any man of so impudent o
^pirite / thus shamelesly to abuse such a^iose names against the giltles /
when he and his fellows (the treuthe being known) be of all men lyuinge most
faultye ^n those vices. Nevertheless when I con^ider the prophecies spoken
before / of this wicked generation I cease maruaylinge and perceive well that
they must needs be of that sort and number whom the scryp^ure names painted
sepulchers / the com^any of syn^ers / The church malignant / The Synagoge of
Satan / The right names of the Papists.
Trees with ^ut fruit dumm dogs / deaf Serpents (as the scripture reports /
of such) wol^es / Bears / Lyo^s / Add's frye / false pro^hets / false
Apostles / infideles / wearers of whores faces / The companio^s of the ^es /
Murderers of the Saints of God ^he enemies of the Cross of Christ / the
^ompany of dissemblers / and the church ^f hypocrytes etc. These names I know
Martin and his fellows will refuse / be ^ause they love nothing worse then the
true confession which is the testimony of right repentance. And because all
these names may well be includid under the name of (Heretic) wherewith amongst
other Martyn so often / and so horriblye barketh against us: I have thought
good before I proceed further / to join with Martyn and all the rest of his
sect for trial wheather of us be most worthy of the name (heretic.) And in
conclusion / when it shall appear by plain demo^stratio^ whether of us both
is the heretic in deed / let then him have lechory / and theft / and Treason
/ and what other vice ye will an^exid unto him in the name of God. For I am
contentid also to grant to Martyn to help him forward that vices be lyncked /
and coupled as vertewes together. I^^. 2.
For Saint James says he that offends in one / offends in all / for so
much as he becom^eth gylty of all. Whereby thou may see good read / that
Martyn needs not to have stand long about the proof of this point.i. (that
heresy and lechory be commonly joined to gether) for it is prouid by S. James
/ that vices hang of such sort together that whosoever ^^fendeth in one may be
charged with all ^^e other: Therefore should Martyn ha^^ left of this unnecessary
labor / if he min^^ to touch married priests / and should ^ther have trauayled
in the proof of his ^inor / that is to say that married priest^ (...) heretics
/ And that those two vices ^^resy and lechory meet together in all ^aried
priests. But this thing Mar^^^ has left undone / by means whereof ^^s
cauillatio^ is discouerid / Yea and it is ^^rteine that many old heriques
lyuide ^astly touching the body. Yet that this ^^inge may more evidently
appear vn^^the / I will set brefly before thine eyes ^^e whole som^e of this
reason / which he ^^tendeth at large / but hydeth notwith^^dinge from thee /
the minor or mean pro^^sitio^: because he can not prove it / Thus (...)
reasons. Martins reason.

Martin failetht in the proof of this minor.


Heresy and lechory become (...) only joined together: but all married ^^iests be
heretics / ergo they be lech^^s or contrary they be lechors / ergo / they
(...) here^iques. This is his very reason ^^sence. Now let it be grauntid /
that ^^resy and lechory be commonly joined ^^gether / yet if he would by means

book de vtilitate credendi.

An heretic is definid.


S. Austen in the begin^inge of his book De utilitate credendi / Against the
Manichaeis / makes this definition of an heretic.

Haereticus est qui alicuius temporalis commodi and maxim gloriae,
principatusque causa, falsas ac no uas opiniones gignit and sequitur.

An heretic is he who begins and follows false and new opinions / upon
hope of wordly commodity / and to thinte^t to be in glory and authority /
And this formor definition of Saint Austen may be gathered out of Irenaeus

Cyprianus.
24. q. 3. Her.
Her: All these old fathers / and all other of name and antiquity / ap^proue
and allow this definition of an here^tique. The difinition of heresy.
So that I may boldly pronounce the definition of Heresy to be this: Heresy
is a choice and a stubborn and froward defense / of certain opinions and
doctrines which be contrary to gods word / either by reason of ignorance /
or of contempt of the same word / thereby to atteyn either to lucre / or to
estimation. The material part of this definition is the opinions and
doctrines contrary to Gods word. The formal cause / the choice and stubborn
defense / the efficie^t cause / where by they be mouid and led to be ignorant /
and the contempt of Gods holy word / and a froward will: The Papists take upon
them the defense of justification by wor^es contrary to gods word and agree
the re^^ with Pelagi^s the heretic.
The final cause or the end / is the intent to attain to honor pleasure and
wordly riches: Nothing is there more to be desired for the perfection of this
definition. Now then forth with to join with the Martyn / and all the Papists
for plain proof by this definition that ye be all here^iques. Have not you
Papists taken apo^ you the defense of the ^octrine of justification by man's
works alowing and folowinge the pestilent heretic Pellagius / directly
contrary to the doctrine of Gods holy word / and again all the old learned
fathers and Doctors in the church of Christ? If ye would obstinatly say it is
not against the scriptures / does not Saint Paul plainly condemn you saing.
We think that man is justified by faith / without the works / of the law? Romans
2.
And again to the Galatians: If righteousness comme by keeping of the law / then
is Christ dead in vain? Gal. 2*


Yea does not Saint Paul in a number of places so set the righeousnes of
faith and the rightousnes of works / Romans 11.14. Ph. 3. Ephesians. ^^ Heb. 11.
the one against the other that the one allwai excludes the other? And in the
8. to the Romans does he not say plainly that he is of this opinion that the
afflictions of this life are not worthy the glory that shall be showed upon
us? can you avoid it / but in that place he speaks of the best kind of works
as sufferinge Martyrdom for Christ's sake? Sola fides.
etc. But ye reply and say / sola fides / only faith is not found in the
scriptures. Do you not by this replication show your self blind either of
ignorance or of frowardnes? which for one piece of the definicion of an
heritiqu^ knowing that the scriptures has thi^ word absque operibus, Romans 3
Mar. ^ Romans 3.
without works and ( tantummodo creed) believe only? and ( gratis) freely
which be evidently equivalent*

Nay say you again / the doctors do not so take it* As though ye were men
well seen in the doctors / when in deed the most of you have read either none
of the Doctors / orels few other doctors the^ the rags of doctors gathered
togethe^ by Gratian with the Popes decrees / and such like. The papists do
hold that only faith justifies is not found in the Doctors^
And as for thy self thy study and learning is to well known to be allowed
for o^e that is seen in the Doctors. But to the intent it may appear to all
the world / what lienge marchantes you be / and how falsely you report the
Doctors / for the maintenance of your heriresies / I shall shortly rehearse
unto you / a brefe collection out of the doctors / which have the very words
/ Sola fides (only faith justifies) Which be the very words that you like
blasphemose members of Antichrist say is rank herisie. Places in the Doctors
where Sola fides iustificat. (that is) only faith iusti^^eth is found.

And this is notable / in the old Testament / that sacrifices were offered for
all sorts of people / for kings / for preests / for lepers / etc. But ye shall
never read that any sacrifice was offered for the dead / shall we think that so
long time God would forget the dead? that he would so long suffer them to lie in
the fire of purgatory? The pope ye say can deliver whom he will out of that
prison: If it be true / is he not a tyrant to suffer any man to lie there? The
popes Tyranny and. D. Boners ignorance in his own learning.
If he can deliver any / why does he not deliver himself? If he can deliver
himself why did Sir Edmond Bonner the blody Bushop of London show all the wit
he had / in commanding Dirige andmasse to be song for the Popes soul in the
diocese of London? He did it belik because he thinks the Pope may err /
contrary to the doctrine of the Papists. The Papists ^a^e upon them the
defense of saing the common prays in a tongue not vnderstandid of the people
contrary to gods word.
Moreover / have not the Papists taken upon them the defense of this opinion
that all things red in the church ought to be in the Latin tongue? that is to
say / in a tongue not vnderstandid of the people / directly against Gods word?

Read the XIIII. Chapter of the first epistle of Saint Paul to the Corinthia^s

And do not the Papists babble ther^ matte^s mass and Euensong in Latin /
wi^thout an interpretor / so that the people b^^ing ignorant in the tongue / can
take no pr^^fet thereby? Thus ye see that for the mos^ part (whatsoever Gods

heretics that were called Caiani / who worshipped the Sodomittes / as Saint
Austin witnesses in his book De haeresibus. Some in kepinge whores which they
find out yearly by the means of lent confession. Some in continual longinge
/ burninge and unlawful lusting / for the satisfieng of there deuelishe desire
/ which is plain whoredom by Christ's definition Matthei. cap. 5. Math. 5.


And ma^y reasons they bring in whereby to prove that the use of matrimony is
an ^ncleane thing / saing that the married man is made so unclean bythe means
of his wife that he can not pray / D. 31. Ante* Triennium.
nor receive the Sacraments / onles they forsake the one the other / for a time.

What is this else but a plain remouinge and putting away of all married men and
women from the communion out of the Church of God. By the testimony of old
doctors / The Papists agree with most of the old heretics in judging mariadge
to be an unclean thing.
In this point before rehearsed the Papists agree with all the most old and
aunceant heretics that blew this first poison in to the church of God. As if
thou wilt read S. Austen de haeresi., Irenaeus contra Valenti. Clemens, Alexan.
(...) Theodoret. (...) Epiphanius Eusebius, thou shall well perecane that these
heretics which I will now rehearse were of the self same opinion. Basilides
Carpocrates and Saturninus, Old heretics
137 after Christ / The Marcionistes, The Tatianistes, and all the sect which
of abstinence callid them selves Encratitae 160 and 180. years after Christ.
The Manichaeis 280. years after Christ / The Aerians and Priscillianistes, The
Papists consent to the old Heretics that would not receive the communion with
married folk because they thought the^ unclean as the Papists judge married
Priests only because they be married.
in spayn. And the heretics named / Hierachits, Apostolici, Valesij,
Adamiani, Abellionij, Ampotactitae, Eutichiani, Heracleonitae and a number more
/ all agree with the Papists in this point (that the use of matrimony is
uncleanness) and therefore would they not receive the communion with such as were
married. But all this holy pretense / Was but an outward show / wherewith to
blind the eyes of the people / as S. Austen speaks of the Manicheis saying.

Nec far possum Manichaeorum iactantiam, Retract lib. 1. cap. 7.
de falsa, and fallaci Continentia, uel Abstinentia, quase ad imperitos
decipiendos, ueris Christianis, quibus comparandi non sunt, insuper praeferunt.

I can not abide / (says Saint Austen) the bragging and boasting of these
Heretics the Manicheis, for there false and deceytfull Continency / and
Abstinence from mariadge / wherewith they auaunce themselves above godly
Christian men with whom they are not to beco^parid. Have not our popish
heretics put upon them this glittering show and whorishe face / of the
Manicheicall and such like heretical chastity? Who sees not that they be
altogether counterfetters / dissemblers / hypocrites / maskers / liars /
raylers / whoremo^gers / sodomites / swearers / blasphemers / bludsuppers /
Idolaters / Tyra^ts / Extorsio^ers? who sees not that they be proud under the
color of humility? Enuiose vnd the face of patience / slougthfull / pretending
study? Maliciose in fayninge friendship / covetous / co^terfettinge liberality?
Very Epicures and tenduble glutto^s under the shadow of houskeping? and
stinking bawdy lechors / under the cloak of wi^eles life / or (as they name it)
of maydenhead / and virginity? No trenth / honesty nor godliness / but under
there long gounes / shaven crounes / and side typets / do^ghils of all kind of
other durty vices joined with there lecherose life and heretical opinions /
Martins own words in the lxxxviij. leaf of his book.
as Martin himself witnesses that they commonly go together. And as for
second mariadges Martynn vtt^erly condempneth for dishonest / saying amongst
other arguments in the 88. leaf of his book in this wise. Yea and this one
thing I will further say / that in lay men to / it was thought more lawful
then honest etc.

And in this point Martin agrees with the old heretics Mo^tanus, Martin
agrees with those heretics that hold that second mariadges were vncleare.
Maximilla, Priscilla, Cataphryges, and Cathari (170 years after Christ) with
Proculus and diverse other who were infectid with the same heresy. Thus may
thou see good reader / that not only the very definition of an heretic has
disclosid the papists to be heretics / but also the defense of the self same
opinions whereof the old heretics were comdempned / does confirm my discourse
apo^ the definition to be sound good and true. Now if it shall please Martyn to
let lechory be also annexid to the papists that she may keep heresy company he
may / or else let him desire that it may be scraped out of his book lest the
reader fyndi^g him faulty in the one / shall judge him guilty in the other.
This proof may seem sufficient to all such as will with reason be satisfied /
but I am not ignorant of the wrangling and Sophistical wits of the Papists /
wherefore although my said former proof by definition of an heretic / has made
evident demonstration that all papists be heretics / yet that the same may
somewhat more largely ap^pere / I have thought good to ioyn the opinions of the
Papists and of the m^st aunceant deuelishe and horrible heretics together /
That the doctri^e of the Papists is made of old heresies.
whereby the reader shall well perceive / that there is no opinion almost so
wicked amongst the other sects of heretics already for heretics co^^dempned
/ but for the most part the Papists have the same / or else in stead thero^
another very like unto it / which is as evil or worse. The ordinary gloss upon
the xvij. of Luke
And because Marti^ in his second leaf charge us with the life of Simon Magus
the first and arch heretic tha^ ever was after Christ's time (and the ordinary
gloss apo^ the 17 of luke says that Antichrist shall be the last) I will
first compare his life and doings with the pope the same antichrist the head of
the popish sect and all that follow the popish heresy. Eusebius. Eccl. hist lib. 2.
ca. 1. and 13. Aug. de haeresibus. Theodoretus de Haereticis sab. li. 1. Epiph.
Act. 8.
This S. magus was the first notable heretic that ever was / and a uery
welspringe of al other heresies / and lived in the Apostels time as appears
act. 8. whose heresy followed Menander, Cerinthus and Ebi^ and diverse other.
This heretic taught the people that he was the great power o^ God / and he so
seduced the people of Rome that they raisid up a pillar in his honor (as I have
said before) with this tytell Simoni Deo sancto To Simon the holy God. The
heresies of Simon Magus comparid with the heresies of the papists
Secondarely he blinded the people with coniuring / witchcraft and false
miracles. Look in the margent of the Preface to the Clementines / and in the
decretals de Electione et electi potestate C. fundamenta.
Thirdly he would bye and sell the gifts of the holy ghost for money.

Now compare him with the pope and you Papists. Who is he that has made him
self a God as Simon Magus did? is it not the pope? do not his lawyers hold that
he is no puer man / and that he is a God in earth? Who is it that has bli^did
the world this thousand year / with witchecraft / with wonders and false
miracles? is it not the pope and you Papists? who is it that has bought and
sold / and daily do make merchandise of the gifts of the hoty ghost / of the
Sacraments / and other things that ye call holy / Aug. de haresibus. Ireneus
lib. iij.
is it not the pope and you Papists? Simo^ magus being a preacher would rather
keep a whore (who^ some call Selene some Helena) the^ marry as both S. Hierom
ad Ctesiphontem and Theodoret do witness. S. Hierom ad Ctesiphoniem.
And do not the Papists say it is better for a priest to keep 20 whores the^
one wife? Pighius and Campegius, say so.
And does not Marti^ say in the beginning of his x. Chapter / that priests mari
adges be worse the^ adultery? which opinion most wicked and detestable / The
herisies of Basilides compared with the herisies of the papists lib. 1 cap. 23.
he lyk a vile man (if he be worthy the name of a man) fathereth falsely upon
S. Austen in the 97 leaf of his book. Basilides the heretic and his disciples
127 year after Christ were condempnid amongst other heresies for using of
images / coniurings / and inuocations and such like (...) (as Irene terms
them) things void of good purpose: And I pray you what is the English of
exorciso te when the priest makes holy water is it not I conjure the / says
not the popish priest / that he coniureth the deuell out of the water? Papists
^e coniurers.
etc. Yea and out of bells that com to be cristened? Could Simon magus or
Basilides or any other coniurer that ever was / use any playner words in
coniuring the^ you Papists do use? As many as have seen the hollowing of a
church can call to remembrance what pastime the folish Suffragans make with
the deuell. Suffragans would be coniurers but one deuell can not cast out
another.
And lest there should lack any gestures that belong to coniuring / they bow /
they blow they spit / they nod / the gasp / they sighe / they douck / they
knele / they bliss / they curse and in deed they do the best they ca^ to
conjure / when the simple people that stands by and understands never a word
/ thinks that these co^iuring maskinge merchants be most holily and vertously
occupied. Irenaeus 180. year after Christ Li. 1. cap. 24.
Irenaeus also witnesses that both Bassilides, Carpocrates, and Gnostici
which were about 130 year after Christ set forth images of Christ to be
worshipped. His words be these. Etiam imagines quasdam pictas, quasdam autem
and de reliqua materia fabricatas habent, dicentes formam Christi factam a
Pilato illo in tempore cum fuit Jesus cum hominibus, and has coronant and
proponunt eas, etc. Carpocrates, Old heretics induced christen men first to
worship images.
and his fellows (says Irenaeus) have Images / some in paynting / and some
wrought out of other material substance / alleging that the form or image of
Christ was counterfettid by Pilat at that time when Jesus was here amongst men.
And they did put crounes upon those images and did set them forth with other
images of philosophers before the people. If Irenaeus and the fore fathers
judged Carpocratem and his fellouwes heretics for so using the images of
Christ / shall we be affraied (being of the mind that Irenaeus was) to call
the papists heretics for so using the images not only of Christ / Proces^ions
and carieng the same about upon the cross in processions: but also the images
of the blessed virgyn mary / (which thing Epiphanius cries out upon) and of
Saint Ihon / and of Saint Peter and Saint Paul and of a number other of there
creatid Saints as of Dunstan / Thomas Becket / Vrsula? etc? of whom it is
doutid wheather some of them be Saints or not with God / or damned spirits
with the deuell in hell. And in that the popish preachers / writers and
shameless champions be so full of there allegories / of fables / which they call
narrations / and of feigned inventions: And also in that they say that Christ's
body is so thyn and of so heavenly / The herisies of Valentinus Secundus
Ptolomeus / Cerdo / Marcion / Apelles / agree with the herisies of the papists.
and supernatural substance / that it is in an infinite number of places at one
time / and burn men that hold the contrary: who can deny but that they follow
the dreams / fantasies and heresies of the heretics Valentinus, Secundus,
Ptolomaeus, Cerdo, Marcion, Apelles and such like? Eusebius. lib. 3 cap. 27
Hebion and his folowers held opion (as Eusebius records) that the
observation of the law of Moses (as the Papists say of there ceremonies) was
necessary quasi non sit salus persolam in Christum fidem, The herisies of the
papists agree with the herisies of Hebion and his folowers.
and uitae co^uersationem fidei corespondentem, As though (says he) Salvation
comes not by faith only in Christ / and the conversation of life agreeable to
the faith. So weak was there understanding thaythey could not perceive the
abrogation of the ^aw and traditions / which (as S. Paul ^aieth) stood in
decrees and commandments of men. Ephe. ^ Col. 2. Gal.
And yet does Saint Pau^e cry out with open mouth / that they be abrogatid
bloted out / utterly taken away and nailed upon the cross with Christ.

And he forbids that any man should judge us in meat / or in a piece of a
ho^y day. Be not the new Hebionites the popish heretics taken with the self
same blyndnes? what other things I pray you ^oth the ordinances of the Papists
con^eyn then a certain new Iudaisme? and so much the more wicked / because they
have no commandment by God as the Jews ceremonies had for a time. But Saint
Paul taunteth them sharply for there fond talk and doings. These te^rmes
(touch not / taste not / handell not) ^e of none effect (says Saint Paul)
because they perish by the abuse / and be the ^ery commandiments and doctrines
of men. Yet (says Saint Paul) they seem ^o have some show of wisdom / by
reason of an outward apperinge of a humble^es / and of the hurting of the body
whi^he can employ no suspicion of vntreuth / ^f Martins saying were true.

But in deed they be very madness an^ vayn superstitions / as by Saint Paule^
own words it is evident. Col. 2. Ephesians. 2.
Col. 2. and Eph^ 2. how beit these things be vsid of the popish sect as
diligently / and as superstitiously as ever they were of the Jews / the
Hebionites / or any other sorts of heretics as they know and feel which be
under there quorum / and obey not to them /

The Jews and the Papists comparid together.
And because the whole body of papis^rie is not unlike to a new Iudaisme (a^ I
have said) as well for the very Aronical^ apparel vsid by there popish priests
(...) Mass / and for sundry other Judicial rytes and ceremonies / and there
opinion o^ meretinge and deserving salvation / The Jews and the papists use
all one kind of Sophistry.
for and by keeping of there law: it is manifest that the Papists in these
points join with the Jews in doctrine. And with the same Sophistry wherewith
the Jews would seem to defend them selves when they be charged for not
observing all that is written in the law accordingly as they confess they be
bound: With the self same Sophistri would the Papists seem to defend themselves
/ when it is obi^^ctid that in pryuat masses there is no communion / because
there is but one which receaueth: for the Jew says it is en^ough for them /
if all the law be amongst the^ all observed / and not needful that every one
should observe it all. For the house of God (says he) is one / and if in all
that house or congregation of there is / D. Westons vayn Sophistry for the defense
of private masses before the Queen.
it be observed / it is enoughe (says the Jew) And eue^ so would Watson seem
to answer the former objection of private Masses saying: There is one house of
the church / and the priest that says mass alon does communicate with all
them that celebrat in other churches / or in other realms / though they be not
at his elbow And so he full clerky concludes with this Iudaical Sophistry:
Read they decrees iij. et iiij. of Sother bushop of Rome who lyuid almost 1400.
year agon. and of Ca^yxtus also shortly after him.
that it is not needful for a communion to have any more receauers then the
only priest present. Either of ignorance not knowi^g / or of malice purposly
hiding the canons of the old counsels and sayings of old writers which reach
the manifest con^trary. And ye may well see the fashion of there answers to be
all one* Yt is not needful for one man to observe all the law / The Jew.
but if amongst all the Jews the law be observed / it is enough (says the
Jew.) Yt is not needful for a priest to have any at his elbow to communicate
with him / Watson
but if in all the church of God there be any other that celebrat / then does
he not communicate alone (sa^ith Watson) Lo how detestable and blasph^^mose lies
/ be vouched by the Jews / and the Papists by one kind of Sophistry* for like
as every man both Jew and ge^^tile / is chargid with the observation o^ the
whole law / Deuteronomy. 27. Gal. 3.

The word (Communion) requires that the lords supper should be receauid of a
company present.


by the plain words of the Deuteronomie / Maledictus omnis etc. cursed be
every one that abides not in al^ things that be written in the law / to do^
them: So ought every communion to be ministered by the plain etymology and
sig^nification of the word (communion) to (...) company assembled for that
purpose / and not to any one alon / as the masmongers abuse it. I have before
declarid how the Papists agree with the most old here^tiques / in that they
judged the use of matrimony to be an unclean thing / as the Papists do when
they alledg S. Hierom that they can not do the office of a Christian man and a
married man at once. Hiero^ymus contra ^ouinianum lib. 1.
And when they wryth / and belie Saint Paul saying that he commandid man to
depart from his wife at the time of prayer etc. Feigned holiness of Heretics.
This opinion as well of the old heretics / as of the Papists / has none
other ground but that they would by that means / bring themselves in credit
amongst the people / with an outward appearance of holiness / of co^tinency / and
of uerteuose life. Aug. li. 3. cap. 6. co^fessionum.
Which thing appears in Saint Austen in his third book of confessions: where
he confesses that he himself was snarid / intangelid / and deceauid / with the
opinion / estimation / and outward appearance of holiness of the Manicheis. Aug.
retract. lib. 1. cap. 7.
And it is plain in his retractations / that S* Austen had much more ado with
the overthrowing of there estimation of godly life (which grew first by there
superstitious vsages) then with the overthrowing of there opinions And thefore
in that place he calls there continency a deceytfull continency / The
deceytfull continency of the Manicheis life unto the co^tinency of the Papists.
and there abstinency a deceytfull abstinence / whereby they deceauid not only
the rude and and unlearned / but had almost (as I have said) overthrown Saint
Austen himself / The old Heretics deceuid the people with abstinence from
mariadge / flesh / and wine.
as he confesses of himself* And this estimation of there is increased not only
by there abstinence from mariadge / but also with abstinence from flesh and
wine / as both S. Austen and Irenaeus and Clemens Alex. and Theodoretus etc.
Bear witness in the places before rehearsed. Compare now the deuelish generation
of the popish sect / unto those old heretics / and ye shall fi^de a fasti^g
from flesh amongst the Carthusia^s. as / and other friars / monks and nonnes
etc. But what kind of fasting I pray you? Aug. li. 2. ca. 13 de moribus
Manichaeoru^.
forsooth such a kind of fasting as is descrybed of Saint Austen where he
entreats of the behauior of the Manichae^s. Yt is written (says he) of
Cariline Quod frigus, sitim, fame^ far poterat, haec erant illi spur co
scrilegoque cum nostris Apostolis communia. The heresies and life of the
Manacheis agree with the heresies and life of the papists.
Ca^ilene being a fylthy thief / culd a bide could / ho^ger and thurst. These
things culd / he do as well as our Apostles (says S. Austen meaning the
preachers of the Manichaeis) And may not the same be said of our popish
heretics / and new Manichaeis? And shortly after Saint Auste^ largely
declares by comparison the scrupulose abstine^ce of the Manichaeis from flesh
with the sober diet of the true Christian man. And now I most hartelie desire
the ge^ell read to consider how S. Auste^ painteth out / and most manifestly
descrybeth the fast of the Manicheis to be such a fast / as is now a days /
the fast of our Papists (that is to say) gluttony / and not a mea^s to tame the
flesh as they do pretend. Saint Austens words. Aug. de moribus Ecclesiae
cath. et Mani. lib. 2. cap. 3
And that the sober diet of the Christian man cati^g sparely of flesh is the
right kind of fasti^g. Thus S. Austen reasons. If there be a man (as it is
possible (so spare of diet and profitable withal / that he will eat but twyse
in one day / ruling and tempering with that abstinence / the appetyte of his
throat and belly: And be it also (says he) that there be set at supper before
this man a few herbs / and a little baken / sodde^ with the same herbs / so
much in quantity as may suffice to put away his hunger and that the same man
quench his thurst with three or four draughts of puer wine / A comparison of
the popish fast and of the Christian fast out of Saint Austen.
that is unmingled with water / and that this be his daily diet. And again on
the other side. If there be one that tastes no flesh nor drynketh no wine /
but strange kinds of dishes / made of seeds / and fruits / with habundance of
peper cast upon it / whereof he eats plentifully at.ix. of the clok in the
morning And again at night at supper. And also that the same man drink of the
water / wherewith the husks of grapes be washed after the preszing / and of
sider and such other liquors / which though they be no wine / yet they serve
in stead of wine / yea and pass it also in swetnes. And be it that this man
drink not only so much as he thursteth / but so much as him lusts: And that
he has a daily provision for this diet / and has plenty of these delicates /
wherewith to serve not only his necessity / but also his lust: Wheather of
these twayn / judge you as touchi^g meat and drink / to live in more
abstinence? I think (says Saint Auste^) ye be not so blind but that you will
prefer the man which lives with the litel baken and wine: Note vow Papists
your superstitiosnes in abstinence from flesh
to the other glutton: for the truth it self dryueth you to this answer. But
you heretics be of the contrary opinion (says he) for by your opinion / if
this second man should supp with the first but one night / and should but touch
his lips / and smell of his bake^ though it were resty / Aug. Epistel.
lxxiij. The Manicheis far bad there Priest mariadge as the Papists do.
ye would strayt way condemn him to hell fire / as a breaker of your seal
(that is) of your religion. Thus far out of S, Austen / which saying he further
also follows to the same effect. And likewise in the opinion of the mariadge /
of priests / the Manichaeis and the Papists have like agreement / for they
suffrid so many of the^ as were callid ( auditores) to eat flesh / and to marry
at there pleasure / and to till the ground / etc. as S. Austen witnesses
Epistola 72 ad Deuterium. The Maniche is and Papists agree ful^^ in certain
points.
But there Ministers who^ they callid Electos they would in no wise suffer to
marry / nor to til the ground / etc. Here see thou good reader the full
agreement of the heresy of the Manicheis and of the heresy of the Papists
touching mariadge of prests* And that the doctrine of us (whom Martin and such
other heretics call heretics) agrees with the doctrine of the Catholic
church by the judgment of S. Auste^ and that the doctrine of the Papists in
this point agrees with the Heretics the Manicheis. And forasmuch as both he
and Irenaeus, Epiphanius, The furst that commaundid fasting by a law was an
heretic Eusebi. lib. 5. cap. 18.
Theodoretus and other do note the like opinion of abstinence from flesh in
Tatian and his folowers who were callid (...): And in Montano the heretic who
was the first that ever made laws for fasting / And in the heretics named
Aeriani Bassilidiani Priscil ^^anistae and Saturninus / and diverse other Arch
heretics / which were also enemies to mariadge: Why may not I be as bold to
note this for an heresy in the Papists / as these and other old / holy /
aunce^ant / learned and approved fathers and Doctors of the church of God / were
neither afraied nor ashamed to note these old / As the Manicheis requirid there
b^t named Epis^* fundamenti to be credetid. Sodothe Papists there dec^e^als /
etc.
and many of the^ great learned men / as blasphemose heretics for the same
opinion? Manichaeus also brought in a new doctrine which was contained in his
epistle named Epistola fundamenti, wheru^to he requirid lyk credit to be given
/ as to the gospel and that his doctrine he did beat in to the heads of the
people with all dyligence. Have not the popes of like sort set out there decrees
decretals Sext Clementines, and Extra Vagants, the laws and doctrines whereof /

seat of Rome? D. 29. cap. In memoriam.
I report me to any true Christian man of knowledge / wheather this be not (to
sit in gods temple / and to auaunt himself as God) as the Apostle notes the
man of sin and Antichrist? This boldness is maruelose / considering that there

to defend the Pope there God against Christ and his Apostels. The heresies of
the Papists agree with the heresies of the Mo^tanistes.
The agre^ment also of the Papists with the old he^retique Montanus and his
disciples shows it self to plain. For Montanus amongst other his heresies
feigned himself to be the holy ghost / which fond opinion Manes also afterward
spread abroad of himself / and diverse other / By means whereof he chalendgid
the interpretation of the scriptures / in such wise / that his exposicion and
sense / should be receauid and none other / Mo^tanus the heretic would not be
contro^lid.
for it was as certain as though it had been spoken by the mouth of God /
craftyly conueying to himself the judgment over all other / and excluding all
men's controlement. Of like sort / has the Pope perswadid the world / himself
to be so ple^tifully indewid with Gods spirit that he ca^ not err. 9. q. 3.

any honesty / or shame left / that these doings of the Pope agree full and
whole with the heretics called Montanists, Cataphrigians, Adamians,
Quintilians, Helchisitae, Theodotians, N^uatian^ the Heretics.
Nouatians, Alogians, and such like. S. Hierom writes that the Nouatians,

^hey had in their mouths / the name of goods works / and of the primative

me to the ^ndifferent reader / wheather experience ^oth not daily teach us /

scriptures for there defense. Posui ori meo custodiam I have put a custody to

they so ioyn with these heretics in keeping silence / and so pass them in

neither these nor Christ himself can profet any man: And what is this else /
then in word to confess Christ and to deny him in deed as Sabellius, and
these other fornamed naughtipaks did? Nestorius the heretic.
And somewhat to speak speacilly of Nestorius / the virgin priest / and bushop

the Aunceant Greek Doctor Theodoretus wryeth in his 4. book Heret. fabu. (...).

Nestorius that he couerid himself (...), (that is) under the color and cloak of
the name (Orthodox) And does not D. Gardener the like in his hotch potch book
set out under the name of Marcus Antonius? D. Steph Gardyner was a f^ayd to put
his name to M Antonius because he can not justify the doctrine onles he him
self be judge.
Where although he hyde his own name throughout the bok usurping the name of
Orthodox / as Nestorius did / yet may the reader easily perceive / by his fear
/ to declare his name that he would rather have recantid twis^ more / than to
have burned once / though he were suer that for religion no man was / nor
should be put to death in king Edwards days onles he denied some express
Article of our creed. But now bludshedinge declares of what spirit the Papists
be / how they esteem and love sacrifice and death better then merci. Theodoret
wrote against Nestorius.
The same Theodoret also said of Nestorius (besides the disclosing of his
heresies) that he sought the favor of the people with crouching in a blak
cou^tena^ce / (...) (that is / hu^ting and desyring to be esteemed a chaste liver
/ by reason of the palenes of his countinance: And do not the most part /

S. Austen also with other / makes mention of a sect of Heretics / which
were callid Heracleonitae / The comparison of the Papists with the heretics
named Heracleo^ite
who vsid a superstition in the burial of the dead / condemned in the church

Aust^ that they have a new kind of redemption for such as dye amongst them

the Heracleonits? The fashion of cu^ly burieng the dead / was godly setfurth in
the last bok of common prayer made in king Edwards days / as well for the
reverent using of the dead corpse / as for the consolation and edifieng of the
congregation present. The unnecessary cure of the dead / was by special
commandiment forbidden to priests in the old Testament. Nu. 6.

And yet is there no one thing more regardid in the papacy / and no marvel /

How be it Tertul. in his fourth book against Martio^ seems to prove as well /
by the vj. Cap. of Leuit. as by the 9. of Luke that a priest ought not to cum
to the^ that be dead / no thought it were his father / his mother / or his

upon is Gayn.
but as a thing necessary / And in stead of them they have recompensed
themselves / with diligence in oyling / anointing / sensing and other
ceremonies about the dead. And no small profet hangs upon these two points.
For lak of wives increases there estimation in the sight of the ignor^^. And
there pains about the dead increases there purse and vpholdeth there deuisid
purgatory / with no small gayn. Wherefore they had rather agree in heresy with
the Heraclionits a thousand times / then they would either have wy^es or lose
burial commodities. The Eunomians and the Papists comparid together. Sozo

And do not some of the^ hold that a priest shall not be dampened because he in
to this or that kind of order?

Now forasmuch as the Papists do teach the se^fsame doctrine with the Eunomians
how shall we dout of there agreement otherwise? The sect of heretics that
were callid Euch^tae or Psalliani of whom Epiphanius makes mention contra
Massili^^os, Euchitae.
and Saint Austen de haeresibus who for mumbling up of there long prayers were
callid the praing heretics (for so sounds the Greek word (...)) they would
neauer cease praying and singing of Psalms day and night. And so much they
gave them selves to prayer that they thought themselves bound to do nothing
else: Not to get there living with the sweat of there brows / Not to truble
themselves with any office that concerned the commo^wel^h / Not to study or to
put there hand to any kind of labor: But to live in continual ydelnes / in only
eating / drinking / sleapi^g / and praying. Of whom also thus writes the
aunceant Greek author / Euchite callid themselves spiritual men.
Theodoret (...). Theodoretus li.iiij. de hereticis fabulis.
The English whereof is this. And the miserable wretches being / deceauid / give
themselves to no ki^de of w^rk for they call themselves spiritual me^. But
giving themselves to praying / they sleep the most part of the day. The

I pray the gentle Reader may not a man see the life of monks friars chano^s

The Donatistes and the Priscillianistes, were folowers the one of Manicheus
and Gnostici and the other of the Arrians and Cathari. wherefore there
opininions be somewhat before touched. S. Austen de heresibus.
Yet this one thing I can not omit which S. Austen and other do note of the
Priscillianistes the spanishe heretics. This saying (says he) is allowed and
commendid amongst them: Priscillianistes the spanishe heretics.
Iura periura secretum prodere noli: swear and forswere and utter no secrets.
Oh how well this rule is observed of the Papists. This is such a maxim amongst
them / that almost all there fetches and practices against Christ / be
compassed with perjury. Perimy amongst the Papists is lawful-
I would feign learn an answer to this question / how many Papists be there this
day in England / being born in England that were not either trayters to there
prince king Henry the VIII. or else periurid apo^ the holy Evangelists? Our
Doctrine which is taught by the scriptures of God and was confirmed with the
sheding of Christ's blud upon the Cross / is blasphemosly reportid by Marti^
and his fellows / in the last end of the first Chap. of his book to have his
begin^ing of lechory / and to end in Sedicion and treason / which saying is so
maliciose / that it would stir any true and earnest fauorer either of Gods
word / or of the realm / if it had not been vtterid by the pen af a periurid
traitor: what man can be du^ / when he sees true men falsely accusid / of
heresy / sedition and treason / by a book set out in prynt? Yea by a book
dedicatid to the Queen herself? But write on and spare not / God be praised we
have not only spu^ges to put out that ye write / but we have also pencils to
paynt you in your colors: and be you well asuerid the world shall see (God
willing) ye have made a smoke wherewith to put out your own eyes. Of the
genealogy of the popish heresy.
The Genealogy of popry is not unknown to the world / and that it might the
better be known / I turned a tragedy into the English tongue which was first
written by the excellent learned father Bernhardinus Ochinus Senensis and did
cause it to be pri^ted / where it is showed by a continual discourse / eue^
from the begin^inge how the popes authority first began with flattery /
fflatte^y Ignorance Superstition lyeng and Sufferance have made the pope a God.
and waxed strong by ignorance / and superstition of Princes / and how in
time sufferance / made the popes Traitors / whereby they took upon them such
boldness that being before but the Emperors chaplens they challendgid to be the
Emperors masters. In so much that Hildebrand a pope of Rome and first a monk /
Gregory the.vij. pope of Rome made the Empereour stand (...) forte iij. days

fourth (than being Emperor) to stand 3 days / barfote / in the frosty time of
winter / without door / and would not suffer the Emperor / to be admitted to his
presence. This treason of the popes was allway vpholdid and defendid / by
periure / hypocrisy / idolatry / and a continual forge of lyeng / all which
abominations / being once entrid into the church of Rome / have not seuerid
themselves from the beginni^g / but keep together / not only in the pope / but
in all papists to this day. And for a more large proof of the co^tinua^ce of
perjury among the Papists / if it may please you to read a piece of there doings
/ in the popish general counsel at Constance / ye shall affirm my saying to
be truth. Ih^n Hus and Hier^m of Praga were (...) sid ^y the counsel to cum
^afe and go ^efe / and yet were they c^ntra^^ to the faith / ta^^n and burned.

callid of some Eustathians / and of other Some Eustachians in the time of the
Council holden at Gangris in Paphlagonia about the year of our lord 324 And
these heretics had sundry vsages / 27. q. 2 decret. ex Grego. in reg^stro et

and strange kynds of disgysing themselves with shauings / and otherwise / as
they have diversities of there religions / which be almost infinite. What is
this else but to renyne again the strange behauior of these Heretics the
Eustachians condemned as appears in the old counsel holden so mani years
ago^? Moreover the same counsel Primitias quoque fructuum, and oblationes

Now consider good reader wheather the popish priests take the t^thes of the
people / and convert them to there own use / not only taking / that is necessary
and and sufficient to feed and cloth themselves / and convenient famelie / but
also to maintain there Epicurishe pomp / as I have before declarid /
comparing them with Iouinian. And I report me to thee all so wheather they
chalendge not (as the other rank heretics the Eustachians did) these tithes
under the name of duty to the holy church / calling themselves (holy) and that
therefore these things should belong unto them / as these heretics Carnium
cibos ^anqua^ illicitos reputabant, They judged fleshmeat / as a thing
unlawful? So do the Papists at sundry times by them appointid. Moreover
Presbyteros qui Matrimonia contraxerunt sperni debere dicunt (that is) They say

The VII. Chapter. Martins notable and shameless lyeng / and falsifienge of
authors is disclosid / and confutid concludinge by his own reasons that the
Papists be both Heretics and lechors / with a declaration that the chief old
Heretics and infectors of Christendom with erroneus opinions were unmarried
Priests or Monks etc? Wherein Martin by his own reason is prouid a lechor an
heretic and a traitor.
THis long discourse have I made to this e^d (as I have / before declarid) that
it might appear whether part were heretics. And sei^g I have with dilligent
wayi^g as well by the scriptures as by aunc^ant writers (grounding my self upon
the very definition of an heretic) found Martin and his fellows guilty with
the most rank heretics that have been in the church of god / so that justly
they ca^ not deny / but that they have the overthrow I will take this as a feeld
won. And now turning my pen again to Martyn thus I resume his mayor from the
which upon necessary discorse / offerid by Martins order in this book I have so
long digressid.

Heresy and lechory say thou Mar^in be commonly joined together / Martyns
own words.
and in ^he 4 leaf of thy book thou say (Heresy ^ysseth not to keep lechory
company) whereunto I add this minor or mean pro^osition. But the Papists be
heretics (which I have at large prouid) ergo (to ^on Martyn you Papists be
lechors. Martyns reason turned against himself proves the Papists both
heretics and lechors.
Lo ^t is often times seen / he that will be busy ^urling stones at the son^e /

thou speak of Sim. Magus, Basilides, Carpocrates, and such other heretics /
if it were not to give him oc^asion / that should confute thy folishnes / to
search how the opinions of the Papists and there is agree together? If it were to
declare that because they were Heretics / they must also be lechors: The same
induction being now brought against the and thy fellows / must be no less
hable to prove thee and al other Papists ^echors: sei^g they be showed by
plain demonstration to be heretics If it were to prove us heretics /
because ye feign us with your lyeng tongue to be lechors / the^ should it follow /
that all whores of the ^tewes / and whoremongers were heretics / which I am
suer the Papists dare not say / for fear of inquisitio haereticae prau^tatis

The first heretic that ever was after Christ abhorred the godly mariadge of
Priests and kept a whore.
If this kind of reasoning seem so goo^ in your sight* then I pray you harken t^
this other like thereunto. The first heret^^que that ever was in all the world
afte^ Christ's death was Simon Magus of Samari^ who having not the gift of sole
life / wol^ not enter the holy state of matrimony / bu^ following / or rather
beginning the popi^^he kind of chastity / kept a harlot name^ Selene / The
first heretic in Persia abhorrid the mariadge of priests Aug. Epistola
lxxiiij. Deuterio CCxliiij. after Christ.
or Helena as some do call her* The first Heretic that was in Persi^ was
Manes / the first root of the heret^ques callid Mamcheis who lyuid in su^^
chastity / as the popish priests do / not only refusing to marry himself / but
conde^pning mariadge in the ministers of hi^ sect / The first Anabaptist was an
unmarried priest
whom they callid (as Saint Auste^ Epist. 72. says) Electos. The first
Anabaptist in Rome was Nouatus the heretik a^ unmarried priest whose sect allowed
no^ mariadge in there preests and denied rep^tance to offenders. The first
heretik in spain abhorred mariadges of priests.
The first heretik^ that spra^g in Spain were the Priscilliani^stes / (as
Saint Austen witnesses) about the year of our lord 386 who so much abhorrid
the mariadge of priests and of other of there sect / Aug. de heret.
that they caused the same practice which now most shamefull^ is practiced in
England (that is to say they causid to be diuorsid uiros a nolentibus foeminis,
and foeminas, a nolentibus uiris.i. me^ from there unwilling wives / The first
notable heretic in in England was a unmarried monk. an^o Dom. 400.
and wives from there unwilling husbands (as Saint Austen says) The author of
that sect was Priscillianus an unmarried Bushop of Abile in Spain. The first
notable Heretic of England was Pellagius a monk / about 400 year after Christ
/ who lived such a single life as the Papists now do. The first notable
heretik in Africa was an unmarried priest.


And about a hundredth year before him The first notable heretic in Africa
was Arrius an unmarried priest of Alexandria as both Epiphanius Eusebius / and
other do witness whose virginity was much lyk to doctor Westons saving that
Arrius, kept himself close / and Doctor westons knavery is known to all men.
The first notable heretik in Armenia and Paphlagonia was an unmarried priest.
The first heretics in Paphlagonia, and Armenia were Eustachiani, whose chief
heresy was the condempni^g of priests mariadge / so that they refusid to
receive the communion at the hands of such priests as were married for the which
thing they were condempn^ed as I have before declarid in the Counsel holde^
at Gangris about the time of the Nicene Council which was confirmed by the
syxt synod in Trullo / Anno. D. 324.
holden at Constantinople. And from whence came the doctrine of Machomet /
which now is followed of the Turks and Saracens / Sergius an unmarried monck was
the furst beginner of the Turcks law.
and is much largelyer spread abrod then is the doctrine of Christ? came it not
from Sergius an unmarried monk / that fled for his naughtines from Byzans / of
whose leszons Mahomet mad his Alcoran? Heresy and lechory meet together in
unmarried Priests.
And all heretics before the time of Heiuidius (if it were true as vow say
that Heluidius were the first married priest in Christendo^) were unmarried
priests: Yet were some of them Stupratores uirginum, and depopulatores
matrimoniorum rauishers of virgins and defylers of matrimony as Saint Cyprian
writes of Nouatus. S. Cyprian lib. j. epist. iij.
Some liuid in luxuria and uoluptatibus as you testify of Carpocrates, etc.
now to conclude All these of who^ I have spoken / were priests / and unmarried
priests and heretics / The sophistical reasoning of the Papists disclosid /
and (...) the like confu^id.
ergo al your popish virgi^ priests (if your reason were good) that marry not

uniuersale. Which kind of reasoning is commonly used in the logic of you
Papists. As one special place amongst many other / the reader shall find in
Gardiners bok against my lord of Can^terbery which appears in my said lord
of Ca^terberies bok in the latter end of the sixth pagine whereunto in the latter
end of the VII. pagine / S. Gardener.
my lord makes a learned answer / open^yge to the world Gardiners unlearned
kind of reasoninge. If now Martin / thou can not deuyse some pretty kind of
shift / whereby thou may recant / and make this reason naught / thou have
shamed thy selfwith thy first Chapter / The som^e whereof stands upon this
point: that heresy and lechory be commonly joined together. Which saying / thou
prouest none otherwise true then that the first married priests in some
countries were heretics / and by certain notes / etc. And like as it is a
shame for the in such a weighti matter / to make such a bald reason though
thye grounds were true: so thy grounds being untrue thy rebuk is increased /
for who knows not that Saint Peter was a priest? and the gospel restifieth
that he had a wife / the Evangelists say that Christ healid peter's wives mother
of a fever. Math. 8. Luc. 4. (...) lib. 7. Clemens Alex.


And Clemens Alexandrinus testifies that he did not put her away / but
continewed with her till she dyed in martyrdom for Christ's sake / which Martyn
denies / and the same Clement says that Peter spoke to her when she was in
dyeng saying to her Vxor memento Domini wife remember the lord / and that this
is true Saint Hierom against Iouinian can not deny And I am suer thou wilt not
deny but that Peter dwelt XXV. years at Rome (for so you Papists hold) Now if
it were true / that the first married priest in Italy (as thou do alledg for
the proof of thy purpose) were an heretic / then by this means should Peter be
an heretic onles thou wilt say that Rome is not in Italy. For that it was not
/ Heluidius / shall be reasoned hereafter. Martin can not prove that the first
married priest in France was an heretic by Turo^te^se concilium as he
alleges. To. ij. pa. ij.
And for further proof of thy purpose / thou say also that the first married
priest in France was an heretic / which saying thou prouest by the second
council holden at Towers / a worthy counsel I promise you / of eight french
pusshops all a great / gathered together without the popes consent / which
marreth all the matter by the judgment of the Papists. but let it be grauntid
that it had been a general Counsel / as it was none / and that the busshops
being all Papists had not been so: yet does not the 20. Canon by the alleged
prove thy purpose that the first married priest in France was an heretic. But
it says that this opinion (or heresy as this jolly counsel names it) a
quodam presbytero primu^ surrexit. Ye may see by the Latin what antiquity and
learning these bushops were of
sprang first of a certain priest / not naming where he dwelt / neither whether
he were married or unmarried / But upon this place ye note upon the margent of
your bok / The first married priest in France was an heretic.where all men
may see of that place / it may as well be gathered that it was an unmarried
priest. The place serves as well for the one as the other. Yea and it is to be
thought that Heresis presbyterorum, not to be of the mariadge of priests of
France / but some other heresy begone by certain priests. For if it had been an
heresy / married priests should not have been suffered to receive the
communion. Look bak in thy book of general Counsels one hundredth year / and
thou shall find another Council / holde^ in the very same place at Towers /
in the time of Leo the first / where the Council found falt with there
forefathers which had made laws whereby to remove married priests from the
communion / and took upon them to moderat that wicked law / D.xxxiiij. (...) in
preterito in Glosa.
which was before that time made by pope Syritius (a man altogether unlearned in
the scriptures / as by his reasonning hereafter shall appear) by the which
moderation / The strayt law if Pope (...) against the ^ariadge (...) condemned
by Concil^^m Turost. i. can. 2.442. after Christ.
it is evident that they did condemn the extremity and ungodly Judgment of
Syritius and other the enemies of priests mariadges. The words of the Canon be
these. Although it has been ordained by our forefathers that what soever
priest or deacon were conuictid / that he gave himself to the procreation of
children / he should abstain from the communion of the lord / Nos tamen huic
districtioni moderationem adhibentes, and iusta Co^stitutione mollientes id
decreuimus etc. We not withstanding that ordinance (says the decree) adding a
moderation to this rigor / and tempering it with indifferency / Thus have
decreed. That a priest or deacon which remains in the desire of matrimony /
or else absteineth not from procreacion of children / let him not ascend to any
higher state or promotion / neither offer sacrifices to God / Married Priests be
not remouid from the communion.
or minister to the people. This only may be sufficient for them / that they
benot remouid from the communion / but that they may keep these things / they
must cut of drunkenes the mo^her of all vices etc.

By this Canon it is plain good reader wife / nor whordome neither / (as
Martin 442. after Christ in (...) it was no (...) for a priest to have a wife.
which was a more holy thing than ever was there Idol the mass caak. And
allthoughe the superstition of these french busshops / do somewhat appear in
denieng him to minister the communion to other / yet does there folishnes appear
withal / The Papists seem to hold that the (...) of the minis^er (...) tit^e
the (...) / as do the An^baptists / and the Eustachians.
in that they allow the married priest to receive it himself / if he were (as
Martin says) an Heretic. Who ca^ judge / a matter of less weight to receive
the communion then to minister it? Belyke they were of this opinion / that the
uncleanness of the minister / did hurt the thing ministrid Which was the opinion
of the Heretics named Eustachiani as apereth by the first and 4 Cannons of
the Council holden at Gangris: Gangrense co^ciliu^, can. 1 et 4
and is at this day the opinion of the Anabaptists. And Martin with all such
papists / as say that a priest may not marry because of the uncleanness that
should be in the minister after lyeng with his wife / and therefore may not
minister the Sacrament / do declare that it is the plain opinion of the sect of
the Papists as I have partly before touched. And although I have here matter
inoughe wherewith to charge the Papists and Martin there proctour / concerning
this point / that the uncleanness of the minister ought not to be regarded / in
case that mariadge could make the minister unclean (as none but heretics and
Papists say): I will leave that matter until another place / where I intend to
debate more at large the cleanes of mariadge in all states / Martins lie.
for this present it shall be sufficient for the reader to understand / that
Martin makes a lie in telling the reader / Synodus Turonen. 2. ca. 13. Et. ca.
14.
that the 30. Canon of the second Council at Towers / in France proves that
the first married priest in France was an Heretic. I pass over / that even
in the same 2. popish provincial counsel of Towers in France the XIII. canon
gra^teth the busshop to have his wife as his sister. and so rule the
ecclesiastical and his own house / And also that the XIII. Canon of the same
council makes mention of the busshops wife calling her Episcopa. Episcopa.


That is to say the busshops wife or busshopes / charging all busshops that lak
wives / that they shall have no cumpany or train of women following them etc.
onles they have wives. And to set one Papist^ ^^aynst another and to bea^ you
with (...) oun Doctors look in the bok named Manipulus Curatorum / Manipulus
Curatorum.
where the Papist Guido de monte Rocherij. confesses speakinge of the Sacrament
of orders / that in the primative church / preests had wives / and that they
were callid Presbyterae / and these be his very words. Pressbytera autem
uocatur, quia secundum morem primitiuae ecclesiae erat uxor presbyteri / (that
is to say / the preests wif is callid Presbytera / Presbytera.
because that according to the fashion of the primitive Church / she was the
priests wife.

And thus ye see that we do not only prove by your own Doctors that preests
had wives in the primative church / but we also show how they were then named.
S. Hylary bushop of Potiers in france was married MCC years agon.
And I will also teach Martin that this is written of S. Hylary bushop of
potiers in France (two hundredth year before the 2. Counsel at Towers that he
alleged) that he was both a bushop / and a married bushop / And lest Martyn
should say that he absteined from his wife / which he had before he was busshop
(as he fasly says all busshops do) I shall desire the to call to remembrance /
the epistle that he wrote being an old man (as he says himself there) to his
daughter Abram, who was so young that he doutid whether she could understand his
writing or not / The words of Buss^op Hilari to his daughter Abram.
and therefore said unto her Tu uero si quid minus, per aetatem in hymno, and
epistola intelligis, interroga matrem tuam. If by reason of your tender age /
ye can not understand the hympne and the Epistle / ask your mother / and
immediately he calls her his most dear daughter. Whereby it may appear in
Saint Hylaries days it was lawful for a bus^hop in France to have a wife /
for other^wise the holy man Hylary / would not have vsid it. And the age of
himself / and the youth of his daughter / see^ to prove that she was begotten
after he was made bus^hop. Martin condempneth S. Hilary for an Heretic.
But Martyn like himself / trium^pheth saying no bushops had wives bu^
heretics / wherein his railing to^g condempneth Hylary for an Heretic / i^
any man would believe him / But his tongue is no slander / to all such as know
him God be praisid. Also for further proof of his purpose he alleged out of
Saint Hierom against Heluidius that the first married priest in Italy / Martin
(...) S. Hiero^.
yea in the whol^ world (as he says) was an Heretic Mark now good reader and
thou sha^ here a gloriose lie of Martins. I call it gloriose / because he has
set it forth with such a glory not here only / but hereafter in the 118. leaf
also. Fo. iij. Martins ^un words
Marti^s words in his first place be these. In Italy the first priest that
married: was he any better? (meaning then an heretic) S. Hierom says it was
Heluidius the heretic which de^yed our blissid lady to have continued a
v^^gin. These be the words of the great cl^^k Master Doctor Marti^ the lawyer
(as off himself he says) but I might / better have said / of D. Martin the
liar. For doutles he is a thousand fold better seen in lyeng then lawi^g. Which
appears not only by the most part of the notes in the marge^t in his first
Chapter (pointing to the text of like truth) that be most commenly lies: but
also by this place / and an infinite number of other / where he belieth falsely
the old Writers / not only in falsely turning them / and wrything there sayings
against there meanings: but also in most falsely aduouching them to say / Martin
belieeth the old wryte^s.
that they say not / as in this place / he makes a most shamfull lie upon
Saint Hierom. for I assuer the good reader that Saint Hierom says not in all
his book against Heluidius that he was (as Martin reports) the first married
priest in Itally No Saint Hierom says not that Heluidius was married / and how
may it then be true that Saint Hierom says he was the first married priest in
Italy? So now ye see that Martin is not contentid to make one lie upon Saint
Hierom / but he must also lay one in another neck / reporting Saint Hierom to
say that Heluidius was the first priest that married in Italy: because it is a
lie that he was married at al / And yet says Marti^ S. Hierom reports that he
was not only married / but also the first married priest in Italy. And in this
point also Martin is not a little to be blamed that he does not only belie Saint
Hierom / but also the thing it self is a lie which he faineth S. Hierom to say,
Martin ascrybeth a lie to S. Hierom.
But you will ask me how I can prove that Saint Hierom says not so? Forsooth
two ways / First I am contentid to be judged by the whole book which S. Hierom
has written against Heluidius. Secondarily I am content to let Martin himself
be judge / for these be his words which immediately follow this lie before
wryte^. Martins words.
And (says Marti^) he says not (meaning by S. Hie) that he was the first
married priest in Italy / Lo god reader what need I to have any further
condempnacion for Martin in this point / then his own pen? Well does S. Hie.
say so? no verily says Martin. why the^ for shame suffers he those lines
before in the text? A note to be put in the margent of Martins book.
and that note in the margent / to stand in his book / without adding unto it /
some such note as this is? Believe not Mar. in this place / for here he lies
^gregio^ly. Why but I pray you / is it not enoghe for Marti^ to say that Saint
Hierom says not so? yes forsooth enoghe ^o prove the other saying a lie. Note
that Martin turns the word Sacerdos by the english word spiritual.
But to ^rocede / if S. Hierom say not so / I pray ^ou what says he? marry
(says Martin) He says not that he was the first mari^d priest in Italy. But
the first priest that ^ecame both spiritual and temporal in (...) the whole
world. Martin defends one lie with another.
Now belike Martin ^ath lokid so narrowly to his matters that he will not be
taken with his accu^^omed fashion of lyenge. But what will (...) say if this
also be a lie? think you not (...) the^ he were a meet man to lie for the
^hetstone? Verily god read this is no les (...) lie the^ the other for this
saying is not (...) all Saint Hierom neither / whereby (...) may se his Tongue so
accustomed to (...) / that he can not when he Would / say truth? But I pray you
what says S. Hiero^ of Heluidius? forsooth that which follows in Latin in
Marti^s own book. these be his words. Solus in uniuerso mundo laicus simul and
sacerdos, The English whereof is this: he only in the whole world was both at
once a priest and a lay man. In the which words thou may see good reader /
that there is no mention neither that he was the first married prist in Italy /
neither that he was the first married priest in all the whole world / neither
that he was married onles ye will say that all lay men be married / yea if it were
true that all lay men were married men yet is there never a word in Saint Hierom
neither of (Italy) Martins manifest vntreuth in alledginge old authors.
nor of (first) nor of (last) nor of (mariadge) Now may you see what credit is
to be given to Martin wh^^ he alleges old authors. But it may be peradventure
he will say the printer deceived him / and put it in of his own head I think
there be now / plenty of such pri^^ters in England that prynt they care no^
what / so they may gain never so little though it be horrible blasphemy against
God and his Angels as in the books tha^ com forth daily pryntid by Cawawoo^
and such like appears. But Marti^ can not escape so / for in 118 leaf 1. G.
pa. 2. he makes the selfsame lie again / and says also there / that the
heretic Heluidius was the first married priest that we read of in all
Christe^dom. Martin confirms this lie with repeating the same in the 118.
leaf 1. g. 2. page 2.
Yt is the property of some liars / when they have told a lie ones or twyse or
oftener / that by often telling of there lies to other / at last they think them
true themselves / and so it may be that Martin by often telling this vain
fable / does now think it is a most true story. But seeing it is plainly showed
that Martyn fails in the proof of his grounds where he intendid to prove by
induction / the first married priest in Italy / and in France / and so forth /
were heretics (though he were able to make some proof of other married
priests in other cuntryes) A plain declaration that Martins reasons prove not.
yet can not his reason hold as I have at large before declarid / because some
parts of the Induction being improuid / the reason runs but from an
indefinite / to an universal / which kind of reasoning young Sophisters in
Cambridge be shent when they use.

But Martin fearing lest all his brabling will not serve his turn / has pyked
out a piece of Saint Hierom / where he seems to note certain properties and
qualities / which he says be commonly in heretics / and stryueth to aply the
same to such as had professed Christ's gospel in England. The words be these /
as he does allege them. Notes pikid out of S. Hierom by Martin where by to know
an heretic.
Raro haere^ici diligunt castitalem, and quicunque amare pudicitiam se simulant
ut Manichaeus, Martion, Arrius, Tatianus, and instauratores ueteris haereseos,
Venenato ore mella promittunt, caeterum iuxta Apostolum quae secret agunt,
turpe est di^ere.

The English whereof (as you Martin have handelid it) does evidently prove that
you understood not the latin / for this place does so plainly set forth the
properties of the popish virgin priests / and of the other Papists / that in
all Saint Hierom there can not lightly be found a better. wherefore that the
reader may understand the true sense of it / I will translate it truly / that
your falshod in translation may apperare when my translation and yours shall be
laid together. Hierom. li. ij. in Osce. ix.
Heretics (says S. Hierom) and all such as pretend that they love Chastity
/ do very seldom l^^ue it in deed / As Manichaeus, Martion, Arrius* Tatianus, /
and the renewers of the old heresy. They promise hon^ with a poisoned mouth /
but accor^ding to the saying of the Apostle / it i^ a filthy thing to utter
what they do in secret. Now mark good reader Saint Hierom in this place
inueieth sharply against the old Heretics which would not marry themselves /
The places of S. Hierom brought in by Martin be dyrectly against himself.
nor allow mariadge in other but pretendid such a holiness with a show of
virginity / and hatered of mariadge / that with there holy looks and sweet
words they deceauid the people.

Whereby thou may well perceive that this place of Saint Hiero^ makes fully
against such priests as say they have the gift of Chastity / and have it not /
that live in whoredom and marry not / that pretend holiness in the sight of the
people but lead a filthy life in corners / and in secret. And for example he
names a number of heretics that were unmarried priests / as the popish preests
be / and thought mariadge to be to unclean a thing / to be in a minister / as
all the Papists do / let Martin himself deny if he can that these were
unmarried / so that there is nothing here / that agrees not fully with the
Papists. Lo how ignorance blinds Martins eyes. Ye may see how he ^s felled
with his own weapon. All the ^it he had culd not / or else of frowardnes ^e would
not / make a sense of this place. But note his impudency / In his translation
out of the latin into the English / Words addid by Martin in Englishing the
latin which be not in the latin of S. Hierom.
he puts in these words (against the Sacrament of matrimony) which be not in
the latin / mynding as it seems by a slight / for want of other proof to
persuade the unlearned reader by this piece of S. Hierom^ that mariadge is a
Sacrament.

Which if it so did / yet were it no more for his purpose in this place / then
any vain talk of the moon / or other by matter.

So in this place we have also an other testimony of Marti^s falshod. and see
plainly that the notes / Martins own marks declare him an heretik.
whereby he myndid to have (with the authority of Saint Hierom) descrybed us /
do paint himself and his popish virgin priests evidently to our eyes. But
Martin suspecting by lyk that these notes also / either could not at al / or
not sufficiently serve his purpose / he proceeds to another piece of S. Hierom.
Hierom in Hiere.xxiiij.
^educinge as before / his reason (...) posteriore / trusting that now he has
found out such notes / whereby to prove us heretics / as we can not avoid. And
his no^tes be these. They give themselves t^ gluttony to delicatnes / to eating
of flesh (whom therefore Martin calls fleshmo^^gers) to haunting of baynes /
they smel^ of musk and perfumes / and with sundry other ointments they procure
themselves to be bewtifull of body. I think Martyn would never have meddled with
this place / Another place of S. Hierom brought in by Martin is against himself.
if it had not been for a desire that he had to turn the latin words (
carnibus uescuntur) by the new found english term of fleshmongers / rather then
the eating of flesh / as the word sounds / but the devise of such
fantastical terms agrees well with Martins pen / But to the purpose of this
note / all me^ know right well that as absteini^g / These old heretics were
condemned amongst other opinion^ for that their disswadid men from eating of
flesh.
does not prove a good Christian man / so does not eating of flesh prove a man
an heretic / Manichaei, Tatiani, Montani, Cataphryges, Aeriani,
Priscillianistae Saturninus, Basilidiani, and many other old archheretiks
absteined from flesh and taught this Doctrine that the eating of flesh did
defyle a Christian man / and yet notwithstanding there doctrine and abstinence
/ they were rank Heretics.

Wherefore it seems that S. Hierom did not find falt with them that eat flesh
but with them that eat it not for the satisfie^g of there honger / but of their
pleasure and in such case the eating of fish or of bread other / is not
commendid. The Christen man abhors superfluous diet / and the vayn pleasur
that is increased of eating without necessity / The diet of a Christian man.
and without respect of the kind / whether it be fish or flesh / knowing that
all creatures of God be good / if they be taken with thanks giving / for they
be sanctified by the word of God and prayer. 1. Timoth. 4.
And also that which enters the mouth / defiles not the man but that which
comes out of the mouth defiles the man / Math. 15.
(that is to say) evil thoughts / murder / adultery / whoredo^ theft false
^ortnes / Martin with his notes makes the Papists heretics
and slander. And where as Martin thinks the other notes / as smellinge of
musk / and washing in baynes / and paintinge of faces etc. be notes whereby to
know Heretics: Then it is an easy matter in princes courts / and busshops
houses / and many other men's houses also / to find out Heretics by the nose
/ without the popes kind of Inquisitio haereticae prauitatis. If (I say) the
sauors of Cy^et / musk / perfumes / and ointments be sufficient notes to prove
an heretik (as Martins divinity out of S. Hierom seems to infer) Then must
it also follow / How a man man find out the rankest heretik in a company with
his note by Martins doctrine.
that the greater and stronger savor shall prove the greater and stronger
heretic And then if a man would find out the Ra^kest heretic in a company /
his best way is to get him to a popish procession / (for sermons be laid a side
which reproved the abuse of such things) or to Mass / specially upon a high
day / and he shall try out by his nose / who is not only an heretik / but also
who is the most arrant / and most rank Heretic above the rest. And it is like
that the fayerer / and greater nose shall do (in this case) the better service
/ and therefore it might be thought good that the Quee^ / in bestowing her
bushopriks / should consider not so much the learning of the party / as
whether he have a fayer nose or not that is skillful in sauors. For the bushops
nose (by this doctrine of Marrin) shall do him as good service / as some
handsome So^ner / and in deed might some time smell out his master / for the
most can kerid heretic in the company. Well seeing it is so that we be
condemned for heretics because we smell of perfumes and hot sauors / and
delicate fare etc (If it be true that Martin says) Then take you heed / you
seely sold Papists / of your needles break fasts / of your stretchbelly
din^ers / of your gluttonuse suppers / rear suppers blowsinge ba^kets / and
Epicureus fare: Take heed of your hot wynes / of your hot spyces / and
continual iunketing chere / Take heed how you use baines / or strong sauors /
Take heed ye paint not your faces to make ye seem more bewtifull then you be in
deed / take heed ye carry not cloves or some like thing / in your mouths to
save your breath from stinking / take heed ye dwell not in the north (which is
an other of Martyns notes): for in case ye offend in these things / your great
learned proctor / master Doctor Thomas Martin the lawyer by his divinity has
prouid you all heretics. And as touching my self and other / whom it pleases
his masshepe / to call heretics / we are co^tentid let this be the issew:
wheather of the Papists or of us have more of these notes / let the^ be callid
heretics with shame enoughe / and let the other side be callid Catholics and
Christians according to his clerkly determination. Martin.
Oh (says Martin) if S. Hierom had lived in our days trow you that he would
have written any less of our married priests?Verily it may be thought /
Winchester.
if he were a live at these days / and saw Martins wrything of his writing /
he would not judge Martin one of he wysest / applyeng that / S. Hierom spoke of
the filthy unmarried heretics / to the godly married priests of our days / for
besyds al other profes this on ne (where S. Hierom says he speaks of them
qui pudicitiam amare se simulant (as Marti^ also alleges) that is / Lib. 2.
in 9. caput Osee.
which pretend they have a love to chastity) showed plainly that his sayings
must be applied to such unmarried / as the popish Priests be / and can not be
applied to them which without dissembling there infirmity for the avoiding of
fornicacion take them wives / and live in the godly state of matrimony

Also besyds his plain words qui pudici tiam amare se simulant. i. Which
pretend that they love Chastity / the heretics who^ S. Hierom reherseth for
proof and example were unmarried priests / Hierom in ca. xi Daniel.
and therefore (as thou see) must needs be applied to such a wyueles
dissembling generation / as the same Hierom notes Antichrist there holy
father. Yea and it is further to be thought that if he were this day alive / he
would commend ^. Luther / Oecolampadius, D. Capito, Bucer, and ^. Peter Martyr /
for the sincerity of there doctrine / and for that with writing upon the
Scryptures they have given such a light / as Saint Hierom his eyes would be
joyful to see though it were with the retractation of other things / besyds
those wherewith his friends charged him in his books against Iouinian and such
like as I have noted before. Yt is like that you fell into this wish of Saint
Hieroms life in these days / because ye would find some way to tell the world
(that Oecolampadius, Capito, Capito was no munk nor fr^er as Martin reports
fol. iij.
and Munster, were munks or friars and afterward married men. No man can judge
otherwise that notes your process / and perceaueth the desire that your tongue
has to lyeng. Well seeing Capito was no munk nor friar (as you report him) ye
shall not choose but suffer me to say to you this is another of your lies / for
it is true that of these all that you report he was neither monk nor friar. And
in case they had been as D. Luther. D. Bucer and the other were / it could
neither further your matter / nor hurt ours / onles it be to ease your tongue a
little / when it is desyrose to rail. And where you say there mariadge was both
against the law of God / and the law of man / and also where in the second
chapter of your book you say it is an old heresy new scowerid I dout not
before I have done with you and your fellows / ye shall see it prouid before
your face / that it is an old truth taught by Christ and his Apostles / newly
by you Papists and Gods enemies made heresy. The mariadge of priests is an old
truth / newly made heresy by the Papists.
In which discourse it shall al^o appear / that D. Luther. D. Martyr / etc.
were not the first founders of this religion (as you slanderosly report) but
the patriarchs / the prophets and Christ and his Apostles. But to maintain
your lie withal / ye digress from your argu^ent / and fall to slandering of
Luther and the rest / alleging that he robbed Christ's church of one of the
Sacraments ^allid the holy Sacrament of Matrimo^y. Martin understands not the
Christian men when they say matrimony is no Sacrament and how that is to be
understood.
Thus Martin trouleth his tongue ^t will / not knowing those learned men's ^ayings
concerni^g matrimony / whether and how they think it a Sacrament or not /
wherefore thou shall understand good render that the opinion of these learned
fa^hers / and of all other that fear God / in ^hese days / is groundid upon
Gods lord / and it is this. If ye take the name ^f this word Sacrament largyly
and am ^lye / for any such action / or thing as may ^epresent another holy
thing / The word (Sacrament) may diversely be taken.
then they ^enye not but that Matrimony is a Sacrament because it represents
vn^^ us the conjunction of Christ with his church. Whereof there is a plain
testimony of Saint Paul in his Epistle to the Ephesians. Ephesians. ij.
Howbeit taking the word (Sacrament) after this sort ye shall be forced to
confess / that there be not only seven Sacraments: Bernard Ser. In cena Domini*
but also a great number more / as the washi^g of feet / The wypi^g of the dust
from the feet of the Apostles / The embracing of young children in the arms /
Iohann. 13. Luc. 9.10.
And the most part of all Christ's actions. But if ye restrain the name and
word (Sacrament) not only to those actions which represent spiritual things /
but also to those which be appointed in the new Testament by our Savior and
his Apostles to be ministrid by certain words with commandment t^ the same /
that they should so be ministerid with the offer and promise of forgeuenes of
sins: Then can not matrimony be put in the number of Sacraments namely of
the new Testament / because i^ was ordained in Paradise before Adam^ fall.
Long time after Christ / matrimony was not ministerid at church as platina
writes and other 5. q. 5. aliter.
And matrimony ministered before Christendo^ held after Christe^dom 1. Cor. ^
Si infidelis discedit, discedat. Ergo matrimon^ is not a Sacrament of the new
Testament. And ye read not that / Matrimony was ministrid by a priest at
church v^^till the time of pope Euaristus or until the time of pope Sother (as
Platina writes in his life) who was 170 year after Christ and for the avoiding
of privy contracts made first that decree / that matrimony should be celebrat
at church and by a priest. But seeing Marti^ brought in this matter but for a
rayli^g purpose / I will leave it of with these few words for this present. And
will tell the good reader of another solemn lie that Martin has made whiles
his tongue runeth raili^g after D. Luther. Martin belieth Luth. alleging his
book de cap^iuitate Babylonica. And Pighius also.
He says there / that Luther has written in his book De Captiuitate.
Babylonica, Si uxor no^ possit, aut non uult, ancilla uenito. (that is to say)
if the good wife can not / or will not / the good man may take his maid / Speak
again Marti^ / where says Luther these words? thou say in his book de
captiuitate Babylonica. The self same lie makes Pighius of Lut. Controuersia
15. Take that book in thy hand good reader / and read it over / and when thou
find there / as Martin does report / I am content let it be said that I have
slaunderid Marti^ / if not / testify with me that he is a lyeng witness / and
one of those Doctors whom Saint Peter calls / Pseudoprophetas in populo / 2.

False prophets amongst the people / and false lyeng Docturs / which shall
privily bring in perniciose sects: I assuer the good reader this is a foul
lie that Martyn the liar and Pighius his fellow makes of Luther / for that
saying which they allege in latin / as though it had been so by Luther penned
/ is not in all that book / where Martyn most shamefully aduoucheth the same
to be. Schame ye not you Papists that such a loud lye^g babbler / and so false
and vain a man has taken upon him the defense of your cause? whose own mouth
and pen condempneth for an open liar? Tremble ye not to shed any man's blud /
upon the report of such an impudent man as he is? I will not hyde from the good
reader / Luthers judgment in that book / concerning that matter. In one place
there speaking of the impediments of matrimony / he says that if the man be
such a one by nature that it is impossible for him to do the duty of a
husband: The Papists can not abide luther when he teaches there own doctrine
xxxiij. q. i. quod au^t interrog.
then his contract with a woman / shall not bind her to be his wife and this is
his reason. quia error, and ignorantia uirilis impotentiae, hic impedit

of the man in this case lets the matrymony. Gregori bushop of Rome /
writing to the busshop of Rauenna.
Which saying if you Papists would comdempne / ye condemn the doctrine of your
own father the Pope himself.

For Gregory busshop of Rome wryti^g to the bushop of Rauenna says on this
wise. Vir and mulier si se comunxerint: and di xerit postea mulier de uiro,
quod coire non possit cum ea, si possit probare quod uerum sit per iustum
iudicium, accipiat alium. If a man and a woman be married together (says the
pope) and the woman afterward say that the man can have no carnal knowledge of
her / and can bring forth lawful proof thereof / let her take another.

Moreover before in the same question and afterward / 33. q. i. si quis.
in the Chapter (Si quis) These words be plain and in manner the very same that
Luther has spoken.

Impossibilitas reddendi debitum, soluit Vincu^um co^iugij. The impossibility
of doing the ^atrimoniall duty / breaks the bond of ^atrimony: vnderstandi^g
the same defect ^o be natural as Luther by the plain wo^ds there declares
that he does.

And the selfsame doctrine is largely ^et forth and allowed by the master of the
^^ntence. li. 4. D. 34.

wherefore like as / for this saying Luther ca^ not be charged with any new
doctrine / Magister sente^tiarum lib. 4. D. 34. read the place and judge.
for that the same is taught by the Pope himself and the master of the sentence
/ and Gratianus etc: So can not the same discharge Martin of his former euydent

Martin were not shameless I could not but marvel why he should so report of

ware in his words and so circumspect with his pen in that point / that he will

lies that a m^^ can not tell when he may believe him / H^ says he has red that
history of Michae^ Palaeologus in a Grek author / And that may be true / but yet
it is very unlikely because the histories do declare that there were diverse
Emperors of the east whose names were Michaell / but no more named (as I
remember) Michael Paleologus.
Michaell Palaeologus saving Michaell the seauynth and last of that name
(Michael) who was a thousand two hundredth and threscore year after Christ / as
Chronicles do witness (that is to say) about three hundredth year agon. But the
history that Martin ascribed to the Emperor Michael Paleologus / was (as he
himself says) when pope Nicholas (about the year of our lurd 860) sent out an
excommunication against Photius Patriarch of Constantinople. And so it follows
that Michael Palaeologus the Emperor was (if Martins tale could be true) Yet
another. lie of Martins.
four hundredth year before be was born / whereby it should seem that Martins
talk in this place is a notable feigned lie and so much the more like to be a
lie because he is in all the rest of his book so given to lyeng.

But let it be true that Michaell the sixth (between whom and pope Nicholas the
first / the contention was / for Ignatius / and Photius) were named Michaell
Palaeologus: (which I say Martin can not prove) yet the history that Martin
joins to this matter / (that is) that he has red the cause of the contention
between pope Nicholas the first and him / was for a pleasur that the said
Emperor should show to his uncle for the putting away of his lawful wife / and
marieng his daughter in law / I think be not altogether true.

But that somewhat in this history is added of Martins own forging / desyring to
have some color for his quarrel when he intended to slander king Henry the
eight the Queens father / which intent of his appears / when he wishes that
the like had not been practiced else where. And somewhat this my suspicion is
increasid by that Marti^ refuses to name the Greek author / These epistles ye
shall have To. ij. Conciliorum generalium page 746.
whom he alleges. And again where as in the books of general Counsels / the
earnest epistles written from Nicholas the pope / to the Emperor Michaell the
sixth (for in those days there were none named Paleologus as Martin says)
speak of the putting out of Ignatius and the putting in of Photius / That the
heresy against the holy ghost began many years before Michaell Paleologus the
Emperor was born.
into the office of the patriark / no mention is made of any such matter /
which is not like the pope would have left out / being (as Martin alleges) the
chief cause of there falling out / and speaking so stoutly to the Emperor / and
taunting him so vylie as his Antichristian boldness does. But how much soever of
the history is true / this chief point that Martin alleges the history for /
(that is that the heresy against the holy ghost and the contention thereof
sprang upon this occasion) this (I say) is manifestly false / Another lie of
Martins.
as by sundry substanciall reasons I will prove plain to such as have any
knowledge of the doing in general Counsels / and be not as Martin is

and formest it appears in the fifth book and tenth Chapter of the history of

Wherapo^ it followed that both in Toletano concilio 1. about 400. year after

The latter.7. Nicen Counsel was holden in the time o^f pope Hadrian the first
/ a hundredth year before Michaell had the contention with Pope Nicholas the
first / in whose time (Martin says) this error first began / and five hundredth
year before Michael Palaeologus was born / of whom Martyn falsely fatherid this
story. The time it self proves Martin alyar


Which saying of his / if it were true / how could Theodoretus write of it /
being dead in the time of Leo the first Em^peror (as Gennadius witnesses) many
hun^dreth years before? Gennadius.
will Martin make men believe / that the first Council at Tolet in Spain / and
the 7 Counsel of Nice amendid things so many hundredth years before they were
amiss? Martin confutid and found a plain liar by the decree of Eugenius iiij.
and that Theod^oret could talk of things that were done above three hundredth
year after he was dead? You favorers of Martin behold your own folly.
Furthermore the decree o^ Eugenius the 4 whereby the union of the east and west
churches was declared / does show (as the same pope Eugenius does co^^fesse)
that this dissension for the proceeding of the holy ghost / began nongentis and
amplius annis (that is to say) more the^ nine hundredth year before his time.

And Eugenius the 4. began his rule in the year of our lord 1431. Out of the
which number if ye take 900 and more according to pope Eugenius his account /
it shall appear that Michaell Pelaeologus (though he were in the time of
Nicholas the first as Martin falsely reports) was above 300 year after this
dissension began / which Martin for maintenance of his lies says began in his
time.

If I should bring in the first Counsel holden at Constantinople against
Eunomius for denieng the proceszion of the holy ghost from the father and the
sone what can Martin say? Against this Eunomius / Basil and other has written
plentifulli.

Thus ye see concerning the begin^ing of this heresy against the holy ghost /
Martin is found a falsyfier of histories / not only by the suputation of years
/ but also by the very testimony of the pope himself his God. Now concerning
the cause of the dissension between the Greeks / and the Latins where with
Martin charged the Emperor Michael Palaeologus.

Martin prouid a foul liar by Bessarion a Cardinal in oratione dogmatica pro
unione Ecclesiae Graecae and Latinae, cap. 2.
The learned man Cardinal Bessarion patriarch of Constantinople and Archebushop
of Nicea writes a whole Chapter for declaration of the cause of this schism
and dissension: showing that the bushhop of Rome was the causer thereof for that
he. Sua unius authoritate fretus aduocata synodo generali particulam illam
communi symbolo fidei, non cum communi assensu ascripsit. (that is) when he had
callid a general Counsel / he took upon him of his own private authority /
to add this parcel (.i. of the proceeding of the holy ghost from the father and
the sun to the common Creed / with out the consent of the rest of the other
bushops there assembled. Behold good reader a plain prof / that it was the
rash / and termerose boldness of the bushop of Rome that causid this dissension
/ who of his oune authority would do that tumultuosly / The pope was the cause
of the dissension between the greek and the latin church contra^y to Martin.
which he might have done with others consents quietly / and that was it which
caused first all that dissension that ensued and also the latter ruin mischefe
Destruction / and Turkishe Captivity / which Martin faith is this day lighted
upon the church of God in Grecia.

But Martin will say the thing that he did was Good:

Yea but the manner of the doi^g was such as I think Martin / if he thoroughly
knew it / as he would seem to do / he himself (for all his folly) will not yet
defend it / And the inconveniences that followed the popes brainles and beastly
audacitie / declare that the means which he vsid in compassing his doings /
were wicked and deuelish. So that where as Martin imputes the breche and
contention between the Greek and latin church and the over throw / both of the
Grecians church and kingdom / to the lecherose life of the uncle to the
Emperor Michaell Palaeologus: it is prouid / that the Pope / the author of al
mischefe in the church of God / was the only match that kindled this fire. A
worthi matter doutles to depryue the Pope for ever after bearing any rule
though^ there were nothing else wherewith to charge him. Two lies at acast of
Martins.
And thus is Martin once again ouerthrown with his own reason and taken with a
duble lie: as well for alleging the heresy against the holy ghost to begin so
lately / which began so many hundredth year before / As for auouching the
dissension which arose between the east and the west church to proceed first of
the lechory and Ambition / (as he terms it in his note in the marge^t) of the
Emperor Michael Palaeologus and his uncle / To.iij. generalium conciliorum.
which proceeded first (as ye see by the testimony of Bessario^) from Gods great
enemy / the pope the Archheretik in Christendom. Now to make an end of answer
to that few lines which remain in Martins first Chapter / I need not to take
further pains / because they be nothing else but lies and raylings / grounded
upon false grounds as I have before declarid / only to this e^d / that king
Henthe eight the Queens father might appear to the world both a lechor an
heretic and a man full of all other wickedness / out of whose naughty life
Marti^ would have all the preachi^g in King Edwards days which he calls
heresy / to have his first Original. And the procedings of the late
parliament in the second year of the Queens reign / wherein all her fathers
doings in religion be condemned / seem to confirm the same. So that the Queens
father (if he had been such a man as the Papists report him) were now condemned
with us. Wherefore it is to be thought / seeing almighty God has permitted some
of us / to suffir martyrdom by fire / by blody persecution and the Tyranny of
the popes law / and torments for professing the truth of Gods word: that now
the body of that noble Prince the Queens father (because he was the beginner of
all this as Martin reports / If king Henry the viij. were an heretik why
lies his body at windsore vn^in^ied.
and the continewer of it XXV. year / as the procedings of the parliament seem
to pronounce) shall be taken up at windsor and burned as wicklyffes was. All men
of wisdom and discretion may well judge of thee (if thou were not as thou
show thy self / a shameless rayler void of all regard / against whom thy tongue
talks) that it had been thy part to have couerid the fault of the Queens
father / if thou had any fault wherewith to charge him / lest the world
perceive some unnaturalness in her / so to suffer her noble father now being
dead / to be rayled upon by one who showed himself a traitor to him when he was
a live. All the world right well knows / that there is no spark / nether of
Gods spirit / neither of good nature / in those children / which are not
grieved to here / there dead parents evil reported / and there faults reveled.
Such is the reverence dew to them that be dead / unto whom we ought obedience
in the time of there tyfe / And what / good opinion may any man ever hereafter
conceive / of thee / when thy shameless pen does confess now / that thou were a
traitor the^. But this is not thy peculiar vice alone / but of Steph. Gardener
also and of a great rabble of the rest / who glory in nothing more now / then
that they have been rank traitors this many years / And what thing shall have
the name of vice / where treason is made a vertew? Or what justice ca^ be
ministerid where a traitor is the judge? Who knows not in a counsel where
there be but twelve / what a perelose thing it was to have one Judas? though
none of the rest loved him? how much more it is the^ perelos / where all the rest
allow his counsels and doings / and make as it were of an old Judas / Martin
prouid a traitor by his own reasoning.
a new Christ? Upon this bold confession of thy trayterose heart / vtterid in
declaration of thy fained history of Michael Palaeologus I may by thine own
judgment / judge thee to be a traitor still. Martins words in his bok sol.
xxviij. Brought in against himself.
For in the 20 leaf of thy book thou bring in a rule of the law saying /
Semel malus, semper praesumitur esse malus, in codem genere mali. i. (that is
by thine own interpretation. A person once evil is ever presumed to be evil
in the same kind of euel* Which rule being true (as thou say it is thought
in law) All men may give sentence against the and such like / by the judgment
of thine own pen and by force of thin own argument That thou and such thy
fellows / be at this present all rank Traitors. This reason is none of mine /
but thine own reason it is / that cutteth thin own Throt.

And I dout not but the indifferent read will confess that hither to I have
fought with the with thine own weapons and reasons as well in proving the
Papists heretics and lechors / as also in this part proving the and such
like traitors. And because your glory is so great in the name of old Doctors /
I have by the most old Doctors confirmed all my profes / or else by such not so
old / as thou thy self have abusid for thy wicked purpose. whereby the reader
shall also perceive / that your glory in the name of the Doctors / The Papists
glory in vayn in the name of Doctors.
is but a vayn blast / blown into men's ea^es / to stop them from hering the
treuth of gods word. wherein though thy writing declares the al thogether
ignorant / yet seem thou very loath so to appear to the reader / and
therefore in the last end of this Chapter thou have chopped in a piece of
scripture / Romans xvj.
a strong piece of new clothe sewed to a rotten garment / and therefore / for it
renteth all that thou have patched before into pieces. I pray you brethren
(say thou out of Saint Paul) beware of them who cause dissentions / and
offenses against the doctrine which you have learned / and void your selfs from
there company / and flee them / for such persons serve not Christ our lord but
there belly. These be Saint Paul's words by thee alegid. To this Mayor / or
grownd I add this Minor or mean proposition. But you Papists cause dissentions
and offenses against the doctrine that S. Paul taught in the same Epistle to
the Romans (of which doctrine he there speaks) in that ye hold a man is made
righteous by his works / The Papists dissent from S. Paul's doctrine.
and that a man of himself may merit eternal salvation / and in your other
opinions of original sin / of merits / and fre will / and against the eternal
predestination of God / and against the obedience of certain of your shaven
generation to magistrates / as of the pope / who is in deed a subject to the
superiall power and yet you exclude him / from all obedience / and of your
monks ad such like: Ye and more over you teach other Doctrines of pardons / of
pilgremages / of worshipping of Images / of mass / and diriges / and of diverse
kinds of Idolatries which Saint Paul nor none of the Apostles of Christ never
herd of: but these be doctrines both praeter and contra besides and against the
doctrines which the Romans had received at the hands of Saint Paul or
otherwise of Christ or of any of his Apostles: wherefore this is a necessary
conclusion that Saint Paul in that place which you allege / S. Paul teaches
al men to beware fo the Papists / by the place by martin alleged.
bids all men under the name of the Romans to beware of you Papists / and
such like rank heretics as you be / because ye be not the ministers and
servants of Christ (as you pretend) but ye make Christ your servant and
instrument whereby to feed your fat belyes as Saint Paul there says / Romans 16.
with out regard to the feding of the souls committed to your charge by the
lively word of God / The Papists maake Christ there servant.
but feed them with traditions and doctrins of your own making / which is
neither grounded / neither can by any means be deduced out of the lively word
of God / as you your selves neither can / nor ^o deny / in that you hold and
defend this ^lasphemose heresy. That althi^gs neces^ary for our salvation are
not contained ^n the scripture / which is as much to say / as we ought to
dissent and receive some doctrines besides that doctrine that the Romans had
received by the teachings of S Paul contrary to the text by the alleged. Yea
all the doctrine of the pope chopped to gether and mingellid as herbs to the pott
/ and couched in his Antichristian law / is almost nothing else / then a lomp of
lerning besides and against the lively word of God.

Now therefore good reader I will end as Saint Paul does / desiering and
beseching the in the name of Jesus Christ / to beware of all the Papists / and
all other heretics that cause dissentions / and offenses against the doctrine
which you have learned / out of Gods word / and shune and fly the co^paines of
such / for they serve not Christ our lord but there own bellyes.

body of there popish and heretical learning as it is sufficiently prouid / by
the testimony of the old Doctors / and aunceant writers in this former process /
where there ondry opinions and behauior / and the opinions / and behauior of the
popish sect be so comparid / and joined together / that the godly reader may
easily perceive how Popery / is one most pestilent heresy / mingellid and made
