TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL MASTER FERDINANDO HEABVRN, GROOM OF HER MAJESTY'S
PRIVY CHAMBER.
PIthy and pleasant was that inue^tion of our ancient English poet Ieffray
Chaucer, in his book entitled ( the parliament of Birds) wherein he
describes the strange and sweet harmony among the fowls of all kinds, no
one refusing to utter such melody as nature in her course affoorded. The
consideration whereof (right worshipful) enboldneth me to show my simple skill
in these poor Canzonets. Although many excellent and famous musicions have
set forth in Impression many and excellent works, yet as the silly sparrow
presumes to chirpe in presence of the melodious nightingall, so bluntly and
boldly as a poor member among the musical sort, I make bold to intrude these
silly works as the first fruits of my labor, craving your gentle acceptaunce,
whom I chose for their patron, both for your worthiness and excellency in
judgment, your manifold courtesies and loving kindness, at all times, which
bind me in duty to love you: To show the effects thereof, I know no way but
this simple mean proceeding ( ex abundantia Cordis) And to avoid tediousnes,
wishing you all peace of mind, worldly prosperity and everlasting felicity: I
take my leave.

Yours in all duty, GYLES FARNABY.

Anto: Holbornus ad autorem.
CAepisti been, perge modos componere gratos,
Et quantum poteris numen in art doce.
Caelestes videor (nisi maxim fallor amore)
Exaudire tuis in numeris modulos.
Mill aures Dea fama tibi iam surrigit, ora
Tot quoque diuinum carmen ad astra ferant.
M. Io. Dowland to the Author.
THOU ONLY SHALL HAVE PHYLLIS,
Only thou fit (without all further gloses)
Crouned to be with everlasting Roses,
With Roses and with Lillies,
And with Daffadoundillies,
But thy songs sweeter are (save in their closes)
Then are Lillies or Roses:
Like his that taught the woods sound Amaryllis.
GOLDINGS; you that have too too dainty NOSES,
Auaunt, go feed you themels where on ROSES.
M. R. Alison in praise of the Author.
AS Treasure hid within the golden Mine,
Such is the state of Musiques art unknown,
The ore digde forth the workman maks it fine,
Till which performde the virtue is not shown:
So Farnaby had left this work obscured,
And drowned deserte of praise belonging to him,
Had he not bin by special friends procured,
With tycing speech and filed phraise to woo him;
These works had quaild and he from use had swaru'd,
But well performde and therefore well deserved.
M. Hu. Holland to the Author
I Would both sing thy praise, and praise thy singing:
That in the winter now are both aspringing.
But my Muse must be stronger,
And the days must be longer,
When the sunne's in his hight with ye bright Barnaby,
Then should we sing thy praises gentle Farnaby
