To the Christian Reader, health.
I Do here present unto thy favorable view (most courteous and gentle Reader)
this little Pamphlet, which wanting a particular Patron, comes as it were, a
begging unto thee, for no less then thy whole self, and that cheeflie for
thine own good, the way to protect it, is to direct thy life by it, and to
suffer it to possess thee, as soon as thou have possessed it: which if thou be
so happy to accomplish, it will teach thee to win love by fear: life by
death: yea, everlasting happiness, by the transitory trouble^ of this wretched
world: and to give it just praise in a word, it i^ a work of the learned and
spiritual Granada, aptly translated into English.

Lamentations.
LET dread of pain
for sin in after time,
Let shame to see
thy self ensnared so,
Let grief conceived
for foul accursed crime,
Let hate of sin
the worker of thy woe.
With dread, with shame,
with grief, with hate enforce,
To dew the cheeks
with tears of deep remorse.
Carmen.
SO hate of sin
shall make Gods love to grow,
So grief shall harbor
hope within thy heart,
So dread shall cause
the flood of joy to flow,
So shame shall send
sweet solace to thy smart:
So love, so hope,
so joy, so solace sweet,
Shall make thy soul
in heavenly bliss to fleet.
Vae.
WOe where no hate
does no such love allure
Woe where such grief
makes no such hope proceed,
woe where such dread
does no such joy procure,
woe where such shame
does no such solace breed.
Woe where no hate,
no grief, no dread, no shame
No love, no hope,
no joy, no sola^^ ^^^me.
Non tardes conuerti ad Deum.

^HE FLOVVERS of Lodowick of Granado. The first part. In which is handled the
conversion of a sinner.
The Argument.
Sinners by the means of fear are ^onuerted unto GOD: who if they ^ead, and
dil^gently consider the ho^ie Scriptures, could not but trem^le, considering
the perrill wherein ^hey live. For which cause, forsaking their old manner of
life, they ^ould change it into a better, wher^y they should be delivered from
the ^eare of the punishments of sin, which God threatens to inflict vp^on
them.

CHAP. 1.
ALmighty God is wont to use no one more effectual remedy to restrain the
lust of men, and reuoake their hearts from misdeeds, then by (...) before their
eyes, what pains (...) punishments are appointed for (...)* For evils do more
effectually affect us then good things. An^ experience does truly teach us,
th^^ we are not so much moved wi^^ honor, as with ignominy: not (...) much
by benefits as by injuries that we rejoice not so much (...) health, as we
grieve at infirmitie^ For the good of the one, is mo^^ easily and better known
by the (...) of the other: for no man bette^ knows what it is to be whole,
(...) he yt has had effectual experien^^ what it is to be sick: So that a
thin^ the more it is felt, and the more v^^hemently it affects us, by so much
the more discovers it his natu^^ unto us. For that cause in the time (...)
our forefathers, God was more of^ wont to use the co^mination of p^^^nishment
against sin, then any o^ther remedy; which the writing of the prophets most
manifestly te^stifie unto us, which are fraught wit^ terrors, and replenished
with m^^naces, whereby God foretells th^^ he will punish sin.

So before he overthrew that mo^^ famous city and kingdom of Ie^rusalem, by
the forces of Nabucha^donozer King of Babylon, he ^ritten to have said to the
prophet ^^remie, Take the volume of the ^ook in which it is not written, and in
^^at write all that I have said against (...), and Israel, from the day that
^pake unto thee, to this day. And ^^ou shall read it before the people, perhaps
they hearing all these (...) that I think to do unto them, ^^^urne every one
from their wic^^d way, and I will be merciful to their sin and iniquity,
and I will ^^staine from those punishments which I had prepared for them. The
prophet presently adds, that Baru^h his secretary had described all the
comminations of God, and red them before all the people, and princes, who
says, Each one was amazed unto his neighbor, and (as it were astonished
beholding one another through excess fear, concei^^d by the words of the
prophet) ^^ooke and trembled in their whole ^^^dies.

This is the means (my brother) which God not only v^ed at that time to
excite the hearts of men, and (...) all them from the way of iniqui^^^, but at
diverse other times also* Then which means, there may nothing be found out
more effectual or powerful. For so many an^ so great be those things, which
i^ sacred writ the word of GOD, an^ the perfection of our faith, do^ foretell
and report of the excellen^cie of Virtue, and the turpitude (...) contempt of
vices, that if men^ would diligently read, and atte^^tiuely mark and ponder
them there is no doubt but the pe^^ wherein they daily live would o^^ten
afflict their minds with fear^ and they themselves should tremble thereat.

For this cause, one of the rem^^dies which the Prophet wished (...) be
applied to this incurable eu^^ was thus, which says; The peop^^ are without
counsel, and pruden^^ would to GOD they conceiue^ understood, or foresaw,
the thin^ which are to come. For if m^^ truly did as they ought to do, were
impossible for them so long time to persevere in their vvick^^ ways.

But out alas, they wander so blin^^lie in the affairs of this world, (...)
(...) so much bewitched, or rather ^^ried in the love of the same, that ^hilst
this man hunteth after ho^ours, he is entangled with private ^^fayres; that
man is intent on o^^er men's defects, others gape after ^^fices, dignities, and
promotions, (...) other commodities of this life: (...) of them wholly swallowed
up in ^^nall and earthly affairs, have no (...), neither find either eyes or
^^nde, to examine or look into ^^emselues, that but even for a lit^^^ time
they may allow themselves (...) to consider on this matter. ^eseruedly
therefore in times past, (...) these men spoke the Prophet; (...) Ephraim is
made as a Dove se^^ced, not having a heart: for these ^^robate and lost men,
whereas (...) have a heart to love, to think, (...) rethink, on those things
which ^^long unto this life, will have no ^^nd to remember or meditate on ^^ose
things which belong unto the (...) to come. Which notwithstan^^^g are such, and
so admirable, that (...) man do but attentively wey the (...) of them, and
with an vnder^^^nding void of all perturbation of the mind examine the same,
h^^ shall have sufficient cause enoug^ of amazednes, and reason to indu^^ him
to the correction of his erro^*

Being moved therefore in esp^^ciall by this reason, I thought (...) should
do a work worthy the l^^bour, if I proposed some few (...) those things
before their eyes th^^ will either read, or write, (accordin^ to the imitation
of Jeremy) that v^^derstanding not only the (...) which God has prepared for
(...) loose and wicked sort, but also (...) good which he has decreed to
b^^stowe on the godly and just, th^^ might forsake the way of iniquit^^ that
God might receive them: g^^uing them pardon of al their sin and delivering
them from all the punishments which in the book of holy Scripture, he
threatens* inflict upon them.

The Argument.
Christian must think that he is a man and a Christian, and therefore subi^ct
to death, and bound to yield a reason of his life past in another world. For
which cause he shall do advisedly, if he wey without intermission the horrible
and intolerable griefs which are wont to encomber the sinner at the hour of
death, and the fears and amazements that presently ouerwhelme him upon the
entrance of the life to come. At which time, neither the goods of the body, nor
the goods of For^une, nor any favor of this world, may appease the just and
incensed wrath of God against sinners.

CHAP. 2.
THat therefore we may begin from matters most apparent, and which daily we
behold with our eyes: go to my brother, remember ^^ou art a Christian, and a
man: and because thou art a Christian, be as^^red thou shall yield account of
thy life when thou art dead. The faith which we hold and profes^^ excludes
all doubt, and that it is (...) experience (offering herself dai^^ to our
eyes) truly teaches us. (...) that no man is free from this Ch^^lice, but all
must drink thereon whether he be Pope, whether Ki^^ either any other
what-soeuer.

The day shall once come, whe^^ in at morning thou shall live, and (...) night
thou shall be dead. The (...) shall one day be, (but whether shall happen to
day or to morro^ it is altogether uncertain) in whi^^ thou thy self, which
now read^ these things which we reckon (...) whole, and strong, measuring
(...) life by the length of thy desires, an^ the days by the multitude of
thin^ affairs, shall see thy self lying (...) thy bed, full of grief and
sic^^nesse, expecting every moment the stroke and terrible sentence (...)
death, pronounc^d against all man^kinde, from which thou can no^ appeal to
any other Judge.

But especially it is to be conside^red, how uncertain that hour i^ for even
then it is wont to fall upon (...) when it is least expected: and ^^en a man
wholly secure, thinks (...) of it, but rather intending the ^^sinesses and
occupations of this (...), complots in his heart, how to ^^nd his longer hoped
life in more ^^^icitie and worldly pleasures. For ^^ich c^use it is often
said in the ^^^lie Scripture, that it shall come in (...) night like a thief,
who even (...) is wont to break in, when (...) sl^epe soundest, are most
secu^^, and think of nothing less then (...) imminent theft and perrill,
which (...) the sudden happens unto (...).

Before death himself comes, a ^reeuous sickness does usher (...); which
is to be considered of (...) all his accidents, greefes, trou^^^s, abhorrings,
angers, sirrups, de^^ctions, suffumigations, pylls, gar^^rismes, and sundry
other medi^^^es. The long nights likewise, ^^ich at this time are most
vncom^^^table, wearisome, and full of te^^^usnes; all which dispose and pre^^re
the way to death.

For even as the Captain that ^^ill conquer a Fort, first makes a breach with
his greater ordinance^ then assaileth, inuadeth, and po^^sesseth the same: So
before death* grievous infirmity begins the charge, which so weakeneth and
d^^cayeth the natural strength of the body, that it vouchsafes man n^^^ther
daily nor nightly rest: but sh^^keth all the principal members (...) his body,
without intermission, (...) that the soul is unable to defen^ her fort any
longer, or conserve h^^^s^lfe in the same, for which (...) she leaves her
habitation in (...) body, and having escaped, flye^^ and departs to another
place.

But when the infirmity has pr^^uailed so much, as either the sic^ man
himself, or the Physician b^^ginnes to doubt, and despair of lif^ o good GOD,
what perplexitie^ what anguishes? what agonies (...) at that time excruciate
and tear (...) heart? For then the course or race^ his fore-passed life, is
called to min^ then all the images of leaving the representations of those
things which he here loved, his wife (...) children, his friends, his
paren^^* his riches, his honors, his titles, (...) ^ffices, and all other
things (which ^re wont to be extinct together ^ith life) represent themselves
unto ^im.

After these, the last accidents, which are co^nexed with death him^^lfe do
ass^ult, which are far grea^^r then the precedent. The browe (...) bent, and
the skin is distent, wher^^on a cold sweat breaks forth: (...) balls of the
eyes wax dim, ^^de, and through the intolerable ^^hemencie of pain, are
rolled ^^certainly; the ears wax deaf, (...) nose sharp, the nostrills are
replete with excrement, the face waxes blew, the mouth is contracted, the
tongue is doubled, and can no more perform his office; taste per^isheth, the
lyppes wax pale, the b^eath reinforcing it self from the ^^nter of the
breast, grows diffici^^^t and short: the hands wax cold, (...) nails black,
the pulse feeble (...) faint, (but of speedy motion) (...) we intermitteth, now
antlie cree^^th, the feet die, and loose their ^^turall heat. What need many
^ordes? the whole flesh is turned (...) corruption, and all the members and
senses are troubled through th^^ hasty separation. In this manne^ must a man
departing out of thy^ world, satisfy for the labors and do^lors of others, by
whom he cam^ into this world; suffering in his decease, those griefs which
his mo^ther suffered when she bare him* And thus most signal is the
propo^^tion of man's egresse, and ingre^^^ into the world, for both of the^ are
full of dolors; but that his en^trance causes others griefs, his ^^sue his
own.

Whilst a man floteth, and is to^^sed in these perplexities, suddainl^^ the
agony of death is at hand: the end of life, the horror of the grave the
infelicity of the body which sha^ shortly be worms meat, are represented to
the memory: but especi^ally of the soul, which as yet abi^deth in the body,
but after an hour^ or two must be separated from it^ Then shall thou think the
judgment of God to be present, then before thee shall thou see all thy sins
which shall accuse thee before the tribunal of divine justice; Then (...) the
length, but too late, shall tho^ ^^knowledge, how loathsome those ^imes were,
which thou so easily ^ommittedst, then with many due ^^ecrations shall thou
curse the day ^herein thou sinnedst; and cry woe (...) those pleasures and
delectations which by their allurements invited ^ee to sin. Thou can not in
^^at hour sufficiently admire at thy ^^fe, and thine own leuity, who for
^ings so vain, and of so little mo^ent (as are those which with inor^^nate
love thou were wont to lust ^^ter) have cast thy self into the per^^l of
enduring such intolerable do^^^urs, of which in that fatal hour ^^ou shall
have no small experiment* or pleasures passing away, and the ^^dgement of them
approaching, at which by it self was before lit^^e and now cease to be,
shall seem (...) be nothing: but that which in it ^^fe is great, and presently
instant; ^^ou shall think it greater then it is; because thou shall manifestly
know at length with all his circumstan^^s. When therefore thou shall see (...)
things so vain, and light, nay ra^^er filthy: that thou art now de^auded of
so many goods, and rolling thine eyes hither and thithe^ thou shall see thy
self inuirone^ with so many mischiefs, and trib^^lations: for live thou can
n^ longer, neither is there place for pe^nitence, neither shall there be a^^
time. The number of thy days (...) sumd up: They cannot help the^^ whom with
inordinate love tho^ have affected. Much less the Idol which thou adorest (why
do I s^^ it?) Yea, what so ever thou m^ louedst, and such things as were^
greatest estimation with thee, eu^^ these shall most of all torment the^^ Tell
me I pray thee when thou fi^^dest thy self forsaken in this perr^^ what mind,
what heart wilt tho^ have? whether will thou go? wh^^ will thou do? whom will thou ca^ upon? it is impossible for thee (...) return to life, and to leave
it is in^tollerable; it is not granted to a^bide in life: what therefore wi^^
do? In that day (says our Lord by the Prophet) the Sun shall set (...)
noonday, and I will darken the earth in the day of light, and I will con^uert
her festiualls into mournings* and all her songs into plaints: and I ^^ll put
her as the lament of the ^^st begotten, and her last as the bit^^r day. O
horrible words, o hard ^^^ntence, shaking and amazing all ^rts whatsoever. In
that day (says (...)) the sun shall set at noone-sted. ^or in that hour
sinners shall have ^^e multitude of their misdeedes set before their sight, and
beholding the ^uine Justice breaking their thread ^f life a sonder: some of
them shall ^e stricken with so much fear and ^^^rour, that they shall be
destitute ^f all hope and confidence, because ^^ey shall think themselves to
be ^eprobate, and holy excluded from ^^e mercy of God.

Put the case they be as yet in the ^oone sted, that is, let them be yet (...)
the race of life, (which is as yet ^^e time of repentance;) yet will ^^ey
persuade themselves, that there ^emaineth no time or place for them (...)
repent; but that all means of ^epentance are cut off and excluded. ^eare is
the most powerful pertur^ation of the mind, which faineth ^o it self each
little thing to be great, and is always afraid of things ^bsent, as if they
were present.

If a little fear of any thing can do^ this, what cannot that true fear do
which is conceived of so fearefu^ and capital perrils? They are as ye^ alive,
and placed in the midst of the^^ friends; notwithstanding begin th^^ to feel
the pains and punishmen^^ of the damned. They seem at on^ time to be both
alive and dead: an^ surprised with the griefs of tho^ present things which
they are (...) leave, they begin to feel tho^^ succeeding evils which they
fe^^^red. They deem them blessed th^^ are left in this world, and of the
envy grow their reasons of new grief.

The Sun therefore sets to the^ at noone day, when as to what plac^ so ever
they turn their eyes, the^ shall see the entrance to heaven eue^rie way shut
against them, neyth^^ shall the radiation of any light appear unto them. For
if they respect the mercy of God, they shall think^ themselves unworthy to
pertak^ the mercy of God; If they fly to the divine Justice, they shall
suspect that by it, there are due and severe punishments prepared for them:
^^at hitherto their day was, but now ^^e day of our Lord is at hand; yea, ^^ey
shall think that it is already be^^nning.

If they call to remembrance ^^eyr fore-passed life, it reprehen^eth them
utterly; If they regard ^^e time present, they see them^^^ues a dying; If the
time shortly (...) come, they see the Judge placed (...) his judgment seat,
and them^^^ues exspected to be judged. Now ^^uironed with so many causes of
are, what shall they do? whether all they wend?

The Prophet goes forward. And will make the earth dark in the ^^y of light;
that is, those things ^^at are wont sweetly to delight ^ee, now shall most
of all torture ^ee, and wound thy mind with tolerable goades of grief.

Truly it is a pleasant thing for a ^an in his life time, and in state (...)
health, to see his Children, to ^^ioy his friends, to order his fa^ilie, to
have many riches, and (...) possess with delight what so^er the mind can
desire. But then (...) that pleasure is converted into grief; For all these
things afore^said shall tear and tire the miserabl^ conscience with terrible
tormente^ and shall be the cruel executione^ of these calamities. It is
natural (...) even as the possession and present of a thing which we love does
^^^ioyce us, even so the absence ther^^of should breed our sorrow and
^^^spleasure. Heere-vpon the son^^ of the dying father do fly his pr^^sence,
and the loving wife hid^^ her self from the face of her dece^^sing husband in
his pangs, least (...) presence should augme^t his passion But although the
soul that is p^^^sently to be separated from the bo^^ is to depart into an
unknown R^^gion, and the way is at hand, bo^^ long and perrilous, yet
immeasu^^^ble grief permits not to obse^^^ the terms of humanity and
ciuili^^ neither gives him leave that ent^^reth his journey, to bid his frien^
once farewell before his departur^ If thou have at any time (good Re^^der) made
trial hereof, thou doo^^ soothly understand that I do eue^^ way speak the
truth. If thou (...) never been entangled in this perril ^east-wise believe
them that have (...) experience hereof, For they (...) sail the Sea (as the
vvise-man (...)) show the perrils thereof.

^f therefore such and so great be (...) that forgo this doleful sepe^^^ion,
what and how mighty thin^^^^t thou shall they be that shall fol^^w? If the even
and vigill be such, (...) shall the festival and solemn (...) it self be?

Tell me (I pray thee) what wilt (...) think of that hour, when de^^^ting
out of this life, thou shall (...) that divine judgment, alone, ^^ked, poor,
without any defender (...) thy cause, and thine only con^^ence, thy companion,
and that tri^^nall, shall be so exceedingly se^^re and strickt, where the case
of (...) or of temporal death shall not (...) handled but of eternal. And if
(...) yielding thy account thou shall (...) found to be much indebted, alas
(...) horrible shall the anxieties and ^^rows of thy soul be? o how con^^sed
shall thou be, and full of vn^^i^full penitence? how void of all ^^unsell, and
destitute of all solace?

Truly, the perturbation amongst the Princes of Judah was very great when as
the victorious sword of Ca^^sar King of Egypt, did tyranni^ through all the
streets of Jerusalem when as through the present pay^ and punishment, they
acknowle^^ged their fore-passed crimes (...) old errors. But there is no
co^^parison betwixt that confusion an^ this whereof we now entreat. (...) in
that hour what shall sinners do^ whether shall they turn themselue^ who shall
defend them? tears the are of no force, there all repentan^^ is unprofitable;
in that hour ne^^ther shall prayers be heard, nor (...) promises prevail, or
any suret^^ be accepted. When as the last mo^ment of life is past, there is no
mo^^ time of repent. And if the for^^said find no place, much less r^^ches,
nobility, and honors of the world shall help: for the wise (...) says;
Riches shall not help in the day of revenge: But justice sh^^^ deliver from
death.

But when the unhappy soul shall see her self environed with so many
calamities, what shall she do (...) what shall she say? in what other ^^rdes
shall she lament her lamen^^^le case, then those which in times (...) the
Prophet used, when he said. (...) pains of death have compas^^^ me round
about; and the ^^ods of iniquity have troubled ^^ee: The dolours of hell have
en^^oned me, and the snares of death (...) entrapped me. VVoe is me ^^etch
that I am, what circle is this (...) which my sins have enclosed ^ee? How
suddenly, and when I (...) suspected, does this hour en^^^gle me, how
presses it vp^n me when I least thought of (...) What avail me mine
ho^^urs now? What help me my ^^gnities? What all my friends? that profitte
will my Servants ^^vve bring me? What fruit ^^all I receive of all those
riches (...) goods which I was wont to ^^ssesse? For now a small field
(...) seven foot long must suffice ^ee, and I must be content with the
^arrowe room of a Sepulcher, and base winding sheet.

But that which is worst of all, the ^ches which with so many sweats and
^auailes I have grated from others, shall remain here behind: oth^^ men shall
enjoy them, and consu^^^ them in pleasures, only the sin^^ which I have
committed in gath^ring them shall accompany me, th^^ I may sustain condign
punishme^^ for them. What shall I do with (...) my pleasures and delights,
when they are past away, and naught^ them remains but the dreggs in (...)
bottom, which are the scruples (...) remorce of conscience, which (...)
thorns prick and tear my miser^^ble heart, and shall crucify the sa^^ with
perpetual torments? O dul^^ not to be endured, o my slouth^^^ negligence
worthy a thousand m^^series, how could it be that forge^^full of this time, I
have not prepar^ my self to avoid these present cal^mities? How often was I
warned (...) this day, yet have I shut up mi^^ ears to all counsels?
Wretch th^^ I am why received I not discipline why obayed I not my Masters
why neglected I the words which they taught me? I lived wickedly (...) the
midst of the church, and among^^ the people of God defiled my self with all
sorts of impiety. In these (...) such like lamentable expostula^^s shall
sinners deplore their vn^^py fortunes, these shall be their ^^ditations, these
their considerati^^^ these their confessions.

^ut why travail I in vain, who (...) wise, who so eloquent, that (...)
sufficiently express or describe (...) s^uerity and rigor of that iudg^^nt?
We read of a certain de^^^ed* that after his death appeared his friend,
greeuouslie afflicted (...) oppressed with great dolours, (...) a dreadful and
lamentable ^^ce exclaiming thus. No man be^^^eth, no man believes, no man
^eeueth. His friend amazed with (...), demanded of him what he ^ant by that
lamentation, to who^ ^^re answered thus; No man be^^ueth how strictly God
judges, (...) how severely he punishes. In ^^^firmation of which matter, I
^^^ke it not unprofitable to report ^his place an example of wonder^^^
admiration, which John Clima^^^ reports to have happened in (...) time to a
certain Monk; In scala paradisi gradu. 6.
For says I will not omit also to relate (...) History of a certain solitary
votary, which dwelt in Coreb. (...) when he had lived negligently long time,
without any care at all (...) his soul, at length ceazed by a si^^^nes, was
brought to the last gas^* And when the soul had wholly f^^^saken the body,
after an hours (...) he was restored again to life, (...) upon he besought
every one (...) that we should from thence-(...) immediately depart from him;
(...) closing up the door of his cell (...) stones, he remained there enclo^^
for twelve years space, speaking no man, nor tasting any other (...) but bread
and water. There sitt^^^ he only amazedly meditated (...) that which he had
seen, during (...) separation from the body, and (...) fixed were his thoughts
upon (...) same, as that he never changed (...) countenance; but always
rem^^^ning in that amazement, he silen^^^ poured forth a stream of feru^^
tears. And when he grew (...) unto his death, breaking open (...) door of his
cell, we entered in (...) him: And when we humbly (...) sought him to give us
one word (...) ghostly instruction, at last we on^^ ^^^orted this from him;
Pardon me, (...) man that has truly the memo^^ of death, may ever commit sin.
(...) we were strooken with won^^rfull admiration, beholding him (...) first
had been so negligent, to (...) so suddenly changed, and (by a ^^st blessed
transformation) to be ^^de another man. Hitherto Cli^^chus, who was an
eyewitness of (...) this, and who test^fieth that which (...) saw in his
writings. So that no (...) (although it may seem incre^^^^le to some) ought to
doubt here^^ especially since he is both a true (...) a faithful witness.

Now in this story, there are (...) things which deservedly we ^^ght to
fear, considering the life ^^ich this holy man led, and much (...) the vision
which he saw, ^^ence sprung that his manner of (...), which ever after during
his ^^ole life he observed. These ther^^^e sufficiently approve that to be
(...) which is spoken by the Wise^an; Remember thy end, and thou (...) not
sin for ever. Ecclus. 7.
Least there^^re (my brother) thou should (...) into the like calamities, I
beseech thee with great attention of mind^ to discuss, examine, and often
rep^^^ these things aforesaid, and always (...) every where present the^ to
thy m^^mory. But amongst all the rest, (...) grave consideration and attentive
m^^mory, these three things in especi^^^ The first whereof is that thou
co^^sider the greatness of the punish^^^^ which thou shall feel in the ho^^^ of
death, for the multitude of (...) sins, wherewith thou have offend^^ the
Divine bounty. Secondly, (...) thou diligently wey with what ^^^sire thou shall
then wish that (...) had so ordered thy life, that in (...) hour thou
might have God p^^^pitious unto thee. Thirdly, that (...) remember how great
and austere p^^nitence thou would then willing (...) undertake, if time
might be gr^^^ted thee.

The Author purposely intre^^teth of death, in his first book (...) prayer
and meditation, also in his E^^ercises in the meditation on W^^^nesday at
night; likewise in the Si^^ners guide, lib. 1. cap. 7. and in the ^^^cond part
of this book, cap. 7. (...) in the 3. part, chap. 8.

The Argument.
^he day of judgment an exact ac^^unt shall be required at a Christi^ns hands,
of all his thoughts and ^orkes done in this life. The sinner, (...) the just
judgment of God, shall (...) cast down headlong into perpe^^all affliction,
plaints and darkness ^f the infernal prison. There whilst (...) is tort^red
with most ardent tor^^res and punishments, full of rage, and burning with wrath
against ^od, he shall curse and excruiate him ^^lfe, calling to memory all those
e^ils which he has done, and those ^ood things which he has neglected ^o do.
For which cause, who soever ^ill not fall into these desasters, let ^im repent
whilst he has time.

CHAP. 3.
AFter death, follows every man's particular judgment, Ex duce peccat. lib.
1. cap. 8.
and after that, ye universal of al men, when as that which the Apostle
teaches shall be ful^^d. We must all of us be manife^^^^ before the tribunal of
Christ, 2. Corin. 5.
that every one may receive acco^^ding to that which he has done (...) his
body, either good or bad.

Many things are to be conside^red in this judgment, but the chie^fest of
them is, diligently to wey, (...) what things the account shall be exacted from
us. I will search (sayt^ our Lord) Jerusalem by candle light* and I will visit
upon the men th^^ are intent on their dreggs. Soph. 1.
The manner of speaking in holy Scripture, is to signify, that the things of
lea^^ consequence shall be both discust and examined in that day: even as me^ in
slight things, are wont to light a candle, and search every corner o^ the
house. For there is not any one vain cogitation of thine, or moment of time
euilly and unfruitfully let slip by thee, whereof a reason shall not be required
at thy hands.

Who would not tremble and shake every lym of him, when he^ hears the words
of our Lord; Verily, verily I say unto you, of every idle word that men have
spoken, they shall give a reason in the day of judgment? Well ^hen, if an
account must be made of those words which offend no man, what shall be ^nswered
for dishonest words? vn^hast cogitations? for hands full of blood? for
adulterous evils? Final^^, for all the time of our life loosely ^onsumed in the
works of iniquity? ^f this be true, (as it is most true,) that tongue? what
eloquence may ^eport so much of the rigor and se^eritie of this judgment,
which ^^all not be lesser then the truth of ^he thing it self? or what is it
may any ways be equalled with the ^^me?

How shall the wretched man ^^and here amazed and astonished, ^hen in the
circle ofso many Sena^ors, and the presence of so great a ^ounsaile, the
account shall be chal^enged at his hands, of the least lord, which such or such
a day, he ^^ake fondly and without fruit? Who would not be amazed at this
^uestion? Who durst say these ^^inges, except Christ himself had ^poken them
before? who affirm, ^xcept he had affirmed? What king ^as there ever found,
that expostu^ated with his servants for so light a ^ault? O altitude of
Christian Religion, how great is the purity which thou teach? how strict is
the account which thou exactest? and with how severe judgment do thou
discuss and examine all things? How great shall the shame be wherewith wretched
sinners shall in tha^ place be stained? when as all their iniquities which when
they lived, they hid under the couerts and walls of their houses: what soever
also dishonest, what-soeuer filthy thing they have committed from their tender
years to the term of their life, all the angles of their hearts, and what^o
ever is most secret shall be manifested in this court, before the eyes of the
whole world. Who there shall have a conscience so clear, who when these things
shall begin to be done, shall not presently change his color, and tremble in
all his members?

For if a man do so much blush, when he reuealeth his defects in private, to
some friend of his, so that some one in the very confession waxes dumb, and
concealeth his crime: what shame shall that be, wherewith sinners shall be
affected in the sight of Almighty GOD, and of all ages, past, present, and to
come? So great shall that shame be, that the wicked, as the prophet witnesses,
shall cry out, Esaias. 10.
saying to the mountains, cover us, and to hills fall upon us.

But these things are tolerable: but what shall become of them when as the
sharp arrows of that final sentence from Gods mouth, How horrible the
sentence of the Iudg^ is.
shall be shot into their hearts, Go you cursed into everlasting ^ire, which
is prepared for the devil and his Angels?

Alas, with what sorrows shall sin^ners be discrutiate, when they hear this
sentence? When as we can scarcely hear a little drop of his words (says
Job) who can behold the thunder of his greatness? Job. 16,
This voice shall be so dreadful, and of such virtue, that the earth in the
twinkling of an eye shall be opened, and in a moment they shall descend to
hell (as the said Job says) who now enjoy the timbrel and harp, Job. 21.
and rejoice at the sound of the organ, who now lead their days in pleasure.

This case describes blessed Saint John in his Apocalips, in these words;
After this I saw another Angel descending from heaven, having great power, and
the earth was lightened by his glory; and he cried out in his strength, saying:
Great Babylon is fallen, is fallen, and is made the habitation of devils, and
the prison of all unclean spirits, and the habitation of each unclean and
odible bird. A little after, the same Evangelist adds, saying; The strong
Angel took up a stone, as if it were a great Millstone, and cast it into the
sea, and said: with this force shall the great city Babylon be cast down* and
henceforward it shall no more be found.

After this manner shall the wicked fall into this headlong hell, and into that
darksom prison full of al confusion, which is understood of Babylon in this
place. But what tunge can express the multitude of punishments which they
shall there suffer? There shall their bodies burn in living and unquenchable
flames, there their souls without intermission, shall be gnawed upon by the
worm of conscience, which shall give them no truce; There shall be perpetual
weeping of eyes, and gnashing of teeth that shall never end, which the sacred
Scriptures do so often threaten and repeat. In this place of desperation, those
miserable damned, enraged with a certain cruel madness, shall convert their
anger against god, and tyrannize against themselves, eating their own flesh,
renting their bowels with furious groans, The blasphemies of the damned.
^^aring one another flesh with their nails, and incessantly blaspheming the
Judge that condemned them unto the punishments. There each of the^ shall curse
his unfortunate chance, and unhappy nativity, repeating without intermission
that doleful plaint, and those desolate and lamentable songs of Job; Cursed be
the day in which I was borne, and the night in which it is said, Job. 3.
He is conceived a man; Let that day be turned into darkness, let not god
require upon it, neither let it be illustrate with light. Let darkness obscure
it, and the shadow of death; let a mist ouercloude it, and let it be wrapped in
bitterness. Let a dark storm possess yt night, let it not be accounted amongst
the days of the year, nor numbered in the months. Let that night be s^litary
and unworthy praise, let them curse the same who curse the day, who are ready
to waken the Leuiathan.

Let the stars be da^kned with the mist thereof, let the^ expect light and
not see it, neither the beginning of the rising morn: Because it shut not up
the door of the womb that bare me, neither took away the evils from mine
eyes. Why died I not in the womb, or is^uing from the same, why perrished I
not presently? why was I received into the lap? why sucked I at the teates?

This shall be the music, these the songs, such the mattins, which those
unhappy souls shall sing without end. O unlucky tongues, which speak nothing
but blasphemies; o unfortunate eyes, that see n^ught but calamities and
miseries. O miserable ears, that hear nothing but plaints, and gnashing of
teeth: o unlucky bodies, which have no other refreshings but burning flames. Of
what mind shall they be there, who whilst they lived here, deluded the hours
in trifles, and spent all their time in pleasures and delights? o how long a
chain of misery have these so short delights forged? O foolish and incensate,
what will the allurements of the flesh profit you now, which then you
cherrished, whereas now you are devoted to eternal plaints? What is become of
your riches? where are your treasu^es? where your delights? where are your
reioycings? The 7. years of plenty are past, and the 7. years of dearth are
come, which have devoured all their abundance. There is no memory left of
them, nor appearance: Your glory is foredone; your felicities drowned in the
sea of sorrow: your thirst is grown to that drith, that there is not one ^rop
of water granted by which the immesurable heat of thy throat, which
infinitlie tormenteth thee, may be assl^ked.

Your felicities which you inioyed in this world, will not only not profit
you; but even they will be the causes to you of greater torment. For the^
shall be fulfilled that which is written in the book of Job. Let mercy forget
him, worms are his sweetness. Job. 24.
Let him not be in remembrance, but cut down like an unfruitful block. But
then the sweetness of the delight of evils, is turned into the worm of
grief, when as the remembrance of fore-passed pleasures, (according to the
exposition of Saint Gregory) shall beget a greater bitterness of present
greefes; bethinking themselves the^ what they have sometimes been, and in
what place they now be, and that for that which is so soon vanished, they
now suffer that which shall endure for ever.

Then at length, (but too late) shall they acknowledge the fallacies of the
devil: and placed in the midst of errors, shall begin (but in vain) to speak
the words of the Wiseman, saying; We have wandered from the way of truth,
Wisd. 5.
and the light of justice has not shined upon us, and the sun of
understanding is not risen unto us: we are wearied in the way of iniquity and
perdition, and have walked difficult ways, but the way of our Lord have we not
known.

What has our pride profited us, or the boast of our riches what has ^t
furthered us? All those things are past away as a shadow, or as it were a
messenger running before, or like a ship, that has passed a troublesome
water, whereof when it is past ^here is no tract to be found, neither the way
of the keele thereof in the floods. Such like words have the sinners spoken in
hell, because the ungodly man's hope is like the light feather, which is lifted
up by the wind, and like the light froth of the Sea, which is dispersed by
the sun: and as it were smoke scattered by the wind* and like the memory of
a one days guest passing by. These shall be the complaints, these the
lamentations, this the perpetual penance, which the damned shall there perform
world without end, where it shall profit them nothing; because the time was
ouer-past wherein they should show fruits worthy of repentance.

Come therefore whilst then is time of repent, come you that have ears to
hear, and receive that wholesome counsel of our Lord, which he in time past
gave by the mouth of h^^ Prophet, saying: Give glory t^ your Lord God, Ierem.
13.
before it waxe^ dark; and before your feet stumble against the darksome
hills. Yo^ shall exspect the l^ght, and he sha^^ put the same in the shadow of
death and in darkness. Ex. 1, lib. tract. de orat. et meditat. tract. 4. ca. 4.
Watch I say the time; let us follow his counsel* who before he was our
Judge, would be our advocate. No one knowe^^ more exactly what will hinder o^
profit in that day, then he who shall himself be Judge of all causes: He
briefly teaches us what is needful for us to do, that in that day we may be
secure. Take heed to your selves (says he) by Saint Luke, Lu^a. 21.
th^^ your hearts be not laden with gluttony and drunkenness, and the ca^e of
this life, and that this day do not suddenly come upon you: For like a net or
snare shall it surprise all those that sit upon the face of the earth. Watch
therefore at all times, praying, that you may be ^ounted worthy to fly all
these things which are to come, and stand before the son of man.

(Dearly beloved) let us consider all these things, and at length let us waken
from our heavy sleep, before that dark night of death shall over whelme us,
before that horri^l^ day shall enfold us, of which the Prophet speaks: Behold
the day is at hand, Mat. 3.
and who may think the day of his coming? and who shall stand to behold him?
He, he may exspect the day of our Lord, who has here bound the hands of the
Judge, 1. Cor, 11.31
and has judged himself in this world.

The Author purposely entreats of the latter judgment, in his sirst book of
Prayer and Meditation, and in his exercises in Thursday nights meditation:
Likewise in the guide of sinners, cap. 8. lib. 1.

The Argument.
They who have loved God with all their hearts, shall receive their remuneration
in heaven, namely the glory of eternal beatitude: which in respect of the
accidents, in some it shall be greater, in some other lesser; yet is the
essential reward one, and common to all the elect. For there shall be perfect
charity, and God shall be all in all. For that cause it shall be the common
exercise of all, to love and praise God without end or intermission.

CHAP. 4.
BUT in that we have already abundantly discoursed of the condemnation and
sentence, which attends impious and sinful men; it consequently follows,
that we speak som-wh^^ also of the beatitude, and reward of good men. Now this
blessedness, i^ that desired and holy Kingdom of heaven, In tract. pri. memo.
cap. 2.
and that happy life, which God from the beginning of the created world
prepared for those, who love and follow him. There is no tongue either human
or angelical, that can worthily express what that reward shall be, or what
that life will be. But that thou may have some taste, and receive some
knowledge of the same; I will by the way report that which Saint Augustine
wrote of it, August^. in M^d^t. ca. 22
in certain of his Meditations. O thou life (says ^e) that God has prepared
for those that love him! living life, blessed ^ife, amiable life, clean life,
chaste ^ife, holy life, life ignorant of death, deuoyd of sorrow, life without
blot, without grief, without anxietie, without corruption, without
per^urbation, without variety and mu^ation; life full of all elegancie and
dignity, where there is no aduersa^ie to impugn, where there is no ^llurement
of sin, where there is ^erfect love, and no fear, where ^he day is eternal,
and one spirit of ^ll. Where GOD is beheld face to ^ace, and with this food of
life the mind is satiate, and satisfied without defect.

It does me good to intend to ^hy cleerenes, thy beauties delight my greedy
heart, the more power I have to consider with my self, the more do I languish
with the love of thee, with the vehement desire of thee; and I am greatly
delighted with thy sweet memory. O thou most happy life, o thou truly blessed
kingdom, wanting death, void of end, to which no times succeed by ^ge, where
as the continual day without night cannot have time; where as the conquering
Soldier accompanying those hymne-singing quires of Angels, sings unto God
without ceasing, a song of the songs of Sion, having his noble head environed
with a perpetual^ crown.

Would to God the pardon of my finnes were granted me, and that presently
laying aside this burden of my flesh, I might enter into the true rest of thy
joys, and that possessing the most beautiful and admirable walls of thy
city, I might receive the crown of life from the hands of our Lord, that I
might accompany these holy quires, that with those blessed spirits I might
asist the glory of the Creator, that face to face I might behold Christ, that I
might always look upon that high, ineffable, and uncircumcised light.

Happy is that soul, which delivered from this earthly body, may freely ascend
to heaven, that secure and peaceable, neither fears the devil nor death.
Happy and eternally happy my soul, if after this corporal death, it may be
counted worthy to behold thy glory, thy majesty, thy beauty, thy gates, walls,
and streets, thy many mansions, thy noble citizens, and thy most mighty
kingdom in thy comlines.

For thy vvalls are of precious stone, and thy gates of the purest Margarites,
thy streets are of burnisht gold, wherein without intermission Alleluia is
sunge, thy mansions are many, founded on squared stones, builded with Saphires,
and covered with golden tile, into which no man enters except he be clean,
wherein no one inhabiteth that is defiled.

Mother Jerusalem, thou art made fair and sweet in thy delights, there is no
such thing in thee as we suffer here, and behold in this miserable life. They
differ very far from those things which are daily present before our eyes in
this life full of calamity. There is no darkness in thee, neither night, or any
change of time. The light of the candle shyneth not in thee, or the bright
Moon, or the beamy stars; but God of gods, the light of lights, the sun of
justice always illuminateth thee. The white and immaculate Lamb, is thy
clear and delightful light. The King of Kings, is in the midst of thee, and
his children round about him. There the quires of hymne-tuning Angels, there
the society of the supernall Citizens, there the sweet solemnity of all
those that return from this woeful pilgrimage unto thy joys. There the
provident company of the prophets, there the twelve number of the Apostles;
There the victorious host of innumerable Martyrs; there the sacred covent of
the saints Confessors; there the true and perfect Monks, there the holy women,
that have overcome the pleasures of the world, and the infirmities of their
sex. There the young men and maidens, that flying the snares of this world
with sacred manners, have past their time in all virtues; there are the sheep
and lambs, which have already escaped the snares and pleasures of this life:
All rejoice in their peculier mansions. The glory of every one is different,
yet is the joy of them all common.

Full and perfect charity reigns there, because God is there all in all,
whom they behold without end, and seeing him always, burn in his love, love
and laud him. They praise and love; All their labor is the praise of God
without end, without defect, without labor. Happy were I, and truly happy for
everlasting, if after the resolution of this body of mine, I shall deserve to
hear those canticles of celestial melody, which are sung in praise of the
eternal King, by those citizens of the celestial country, and troops of
blessed spirits. Fortunate were I, and incredibly blessed, if I likewise might
deserve to sing them, and assist my King, my God, my guide, and see him in his
glory, even as he has dayned to promise, saying; Father I will that those
who^ thou have given me, be with me, that they may behold my beauty and
majesty, which I had with thee before the beginning of the world.

Tell me I pray thee brother, what a day shall that be, which shall knock at thy
gate, the course of this thy pilgrimage being ended, that (if thou have lived
in the fear of God) may from death transfer thee to immortality? wherein
others were wont to fear, thou shall begin to lift up thy head, because thy
r^demption is at hand.

Come out (I pray thee) a little while, (says S. Ierosme writing to Eustochia
the Virgin) from the prison, and depaint before thine eyes, the rich reward of
thy present labor, which neither eye has seen, nor ear heard, neither has
the heart of man conceived the like. What day shall that be, when as the
Virgin Mary shall meet thee, attended by all the troops of Virgins, who on
the otherside of the Redde-sea, the host of Pharao being drowned, who bearing a
tymbrel, shall sing to those that answer; Let us sing to our Lord, for he has
gloriously honored us, he has cast down the horse and the ryder into the sea.
The^ shall the Spouse himself meet her, and say; Arise, have my love, my Dove,
my delight, and come: Now is the winter past, the shower gone, and cleared; the
flowers have appeared in our land. Then shall the Angels ^^kewise rejoice and
say; Who is this ^^at ascends from the desert, flow^^g with delights, leaning
upon her ^eloued? etc. What shall the joy be ^herewith thy soul shall be
affec^^d in that hour, when before the ^^rone of the blessed Trinity it shall
^e led by the hands of the Angels, ^specially of the Angel which was ^iuen
thee for thy guide by God, ^hilst thou liuedst, to whom as a ^^ythfull pledge
thou were co^men^ed? When as he, The Angels shall manifest before God the
virtues of the just.
together with ^is associates, shall publish thy good ^orks, and those
afflictions and cros^es which thou have sustained for the ^oue of God. S. Luke
writes in his ^cts, that when that holy Almes-^iuer Tabitha was dead* all the
wid^owes and poor, stood about S. Pe^er weeping, and showing him the ^oates
and garments which Tabitha ^ad made for the^. By which specta^le S. Peter being
moved, he humbly ^esought our Lord for her, and by ^is prayer recald the devout
woman ^o life. What joy therefore, what ^omfort shall thy soul feel, when a^
those blessed spirits shall stand a^out thee, and the Thrones in the sight of
the divine Majesty, sh^^ report all thy good deeds, and orderl^ as it were out
of a Catalogue, reci^^ all thy Almes-deedes, thy praye^* thy fastings, thy
innocence in life, sufferance in injury, patience in tribulation, in delights
temperance, with all other thy virtues and good works which thou did in thy
lyfe-time? O what joy shall be accomplished in thee at that time, for all the
good things in which thou ha^^ busied thy self in this life time? how
manifestly shall thou then know the reward, dignity, and excellence of
virtues? There the obedient shall declare his victories, there virtue shall
receive her reward, The perils of this life, shall in heaven be greater cause of
more exact joy.
and good shall be affected with honor^. Besides, how great shall be thy
delight, when as thy ship unshaken, and arrived in a safe harbor, thou sha^^
behold with thine eyes, thy long and perrilous nauigations? when as tho^ shall
see the tempests which a little* before thou were tossed in, the narrowness of
the ways which tho^ have overcome, and the incursi^^^ of pirates and thieves,
to which tho^ were exposed, and now have safely escaped. There shall thou
sing the song of the Prophet. Had not our Lord helped me, Phal. 93.
my soul had welnie dwelt in hell: Especially after thou shall see so many
sins committed in the world, so innumerable souls daily damned in hell, yet
amongst such a multitude of damned, that GOD would that thou should be of
the number of the elected, and of those to whom that most blessed reward was
allotted.

What rejoicing shall there be, to see the solemnities and tryumphes which are
daily celebrated upon the arrival of new brothers; who having overcome the
world, and atchiued the course of their pilgrimage, and that happily arrive at
length with the rest, that they may be crowned? O what joy shall it be to
behold how the rooms are supplied, and the empty are filled with new
enhabitants; that the celestial City is builded, that the walls of Jerusalem
are restored? O with what alacrity, wil^ingnes, and rejoicing, do all that
ce^estiall quire with mutual embraces, receive those, who coming out of this
world laden with the spoils they have extorted from the enemy of mankind,
hasten to meet thee? For hither upon a triumphing horse shall the conquering
woman enter, who being as frail as the world, has overcome the allurements
of her flesh. Hither tender virgins and innocent maids, who have suffered
martyrdom for Christ's sake, and are honored with a double triumph of the
world and the flesh, shall make have, having their heads crowned with purple
Roses, intermixed with the purest and whitest Lillies. Hither daily come young
men tryumphing in their first flower of youth, with children of vnripened age,
who have overcome their tender years with discretion, and other their
virtues, to receive the reward of their purity. There shall they find their
friends, there shall they acknowledge their Masters: there shall they salute
their parents, there their parents likewise shall embrace their sons, wish
their peace, congratulate their present glory, and entertain them with mutual
and charitable kisses. O how sweet shall the fruit of virtue be then, the frui^
^hereof we loathed in this world as ^ost bitter? Sweet is the shadow in ^he
burning noone-sted; Compari^on^
sweet is ^he cool spring to the wearied tra^a^ler; sweet is sleep and rest
to the ^yred servant; but more sweet shall ^euer-ceasing peace be to the Saints
after this wearisome war. After ^iuers dangers a lasting security, after
weariness, a lasting rest of fore^assed tribulations. Then shall the war be
ended, then shall it no more ^ee needful for a man to walk armed at all
assayes. Heavenly security.


The children of Israel ascended ^rmed into the Land of Promise, Exodus 13.
^ut as soon as they had entered the ^ame, they laid their weapons aside,
they forgot their fear and rumor of war: Every one dwelt without any
suspicion under his vine, and under his fig tree, and there was peace in all
parts round about. 3. Reg. 4.
There might the eyes wearied with watchings, take their rest. Here securely
might the watching Prophet (that stood upon his guard, and had fixed h^s
steps upon the munition) descend and forsake his station.

Here was it lawful for the blessed Father Ierosme, to sursease his watchings
and strokes, with which he wearied his breast during his prayers day and night,
whilst with earnest endeavor, and undaunted mind, he resisted the importunat
temptations of satan. Here shall the blessed souls feel no more the
dreadful arms of the bloody enemy: Here shall be no place for the subtilty
of that winding serpent: hither pierces not the eye of that venomous
Cockatrice, neither is the hiss of that ancient serpent heard; But the gentle
breath of the holy spirit ouer-breatheth this Region, and the glory of God
illuminateth this place? This is the Region of peace and security placed above
all the Elements, whether neither foggs nor immeasurable tempests attain.
Glorious things are spoken of thee thou City of God: Blessed are all those
(says Toby) who love thee, and who rejoice in thy peace. My soul, bless our
Lord, because he has delivered his City of Jerusalem. I shall be blessed if
there remain some relics of my seed, to see the beauty of Jerusalem. The
gates of Jerusalem are builded of Saphires and Smaragdes, and all the circuites
thereof are of precious stone: Of white and pure stone are all the streets
thereof; And thorough the ways thereof Alleluiah shall be sung. O pleasant
country, o sweet glory, o blessed society, what will they do so happy, that
they may enjoy thee as elect. It seems to be a presumption if any man desire
thee, yet without thy desire no man can live: O you sons of Adam, o you blind
and miserable posterity, fearful and lost sheep: if this be your pasture
whether wend you? what do you? why refuse you so great good, for so little
labor? Hear what Saint Augustine says; O my soul (says he) if we should
every day suffer torments, if endure hell it self for a long time, that we
might see Christ in his glory, and accompany his Saints, were it not a thing
worthy to suffer all what so ever intolerable, that we might be made
pertakers of so much good, and so much glory? Let therefore the devils assault
and prepare their temptations; let fasts mortify the body, let garments punish
the flesh, let labors grieve, watchings dry, let this man exclaim against
me, let this and that man molest me, let cold make me crooked, my
conscience murmr, heat burn, the stomach swell, the countenance wax pale,
let me be wholly infeebled, let my life fail in grief and my years in
gronings, let rottennes enter my bones, and abound underneath me, that I may
rest in the day of tribulation, and ascend in a ^eadines to our people.

For what shall be the glory of the just? how great shall be the joy of the
Saints? when each one of their faces shall shine like the Sun? Hitherto S.
Augustine.

Go to now thou foolish lover of this wo^ld, seek titles and honors, build
proud houses, and high palaces, extend the bounds of thine heritage; govern
if thou can kingdoms, and the whole world, all they are not to be compar^d
with the least of those things which the servant of God does expect. For he
is to receive those things which the world cannot give: and shall rejoice in
those blessings, which are for ever durable. Thou with all thy riches, together
with the rich glutton, shall be buried in hell: but he with Lazarus, shall be
carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom.

Of this matter, see the 1. book of Prayer and Meditation, in Saturday at
nights meditation, and in the first book of the Guide of a sinner, chap. 10.
where you shall find many excellent things.

The Argument.
In the infernal pains there is nothing found that may comfort a man: for
even as the lot of the good is universal good, which comprehends in it self
all kinds of good, so also is the lot of the wicked universal, which
includes in it all kinds of evil. For which cause, every one sense of the
wicked, shall be tortured with their peculier torments, aunswerable to the
quality of tbeir sin committed, without any dimunition, or hope of pardon, of
term, or of time. For the pains of hell shall be eternal, intolerable,
infinite, and continual.

CHAP. 5.
TRuly the least of those blessings which hitherto we have rehearsed, might
suffice to engender in our minds the love of virtue, by which we may attain
so many goods. But no^e, if to this so immesurable gr^atnes of glory, the
horror of inf^^nall punishments which are prepared for the wicked be annexed,
who is he so hard-harted, and with unbridled mind rebellious, that forsaking
vices, will not willingly embrace virtues? For the impious and perverse man,
cannot comfort himself with this voice: Be it I am evil and sinful, what of
that? I shall not enter the celestial glory, neither shall I rejoice with GOD:
In this consists all my punishment. For the rest I care not, because I shall
have neither other punishment, nor other glory. Thou art deceived my brother,
the matter is far otherwise; for it is fatal and altogether necessary that one
of these things happen unto thee, either that thou reign always with GOD, or
that thou burn always with the devil in sempiternall fire. Between these
two extremes there is no mean. These in the figure of those two baskets which
our Lord showed to Jeremy the prophet before the gate of the temple, are fitly
shadowed. For the one of the^ was replenished with very good figs, Ierem. 24.
such as those are of the first time, and the other basket had very badde
figs in it, which could not be eaten because they were evil. Our Lord by
this spectacle, would demonstrate to the prophet two kinds of men, the one to
whom he would extend his mercy, the other whom according to his justice he
would punish. The lot of those first men shall be excellent good, neither can
there be given better: but of the other most evil, then which worser may not
be found.

But that this may be the better understood, it is to be noted, Ex tract. 1.
Memor.
that all the evils of this present life, are only single, and therefore when
we suffer, one sense only, or one member suffers, or if more, at leastwise
all suffer not: As for example it appears in diverse infirmities of man's body;
for one has his eye affected, another is vexed with the headache; the third is
troubled with a weak stomach, the fourth is afflicted with the passion of the
heart, and other by other diseases: But none of them all is tormented in all
his members at once, but in some only. Notwithstanding, we daily see, how
great the grief is, and how much the pain, that one only of these evils
breeds, and how unquiet nights he leads, that is only vexed with one of
these pains, although it were but the aching of one tooth.

But let us suppose there is a man, who is tormented with such an vniuer^all
evil, that he has not one member, neither one interior or exterior sense
free from most grievous agoni^s, but that at one and the same time, he
suffers most bitter dolors, of head, teeth, stomach, heart, and to speak all
things in a wo^d, that in all the knockles and joints of his body, is pained
with intolerable greefes: and that the same man being in so great passions,
every member having his peculier dolors, should lie in his bed stretched out,
what martyrdom I pray you, what torments might be compared or equalled by
these? what may be imagined more miserable then this man? what more
effectually might move thee to a sympathy and hearty commi^eration? And if thou
should ^ee elsewhere a dog in such manner afflicted, and striving with
death, would thou not be moved, at least wise tho hard-harted of thy self,
to co^pa^sion? Such affliction (my brother, if these things may any ways be
compared together) is that, which the damned shall suffer in hell, nor for one
night, but without end, in all eternity. For even as they with all the^r
members and senses offended God, and offered them all as weapons of injustice
to serve sin: so in ^ike sort God has appointed, that they all shall l^kewise
be punished severally by a peculier torment. There therefore unchaste and
lascivious eyes, shall be afflicted with the sight of horrible devils. The
ears, by confused gnashing and groaning, which shall resounde in this place:
The sent, by intolerable stench, exhaling out of this unclean, filthy, and
pestilent place: The taste, with raging hunger, and burning thirst: The touch,
and all members of the body, shall be tortured with cold and unspeakable fire:
The imagination shall suffer by the apprehension of present evils: but the
memory by the remembrance of pleasu^es past; and the understanding by the
consideration of goods lost, and mischiefs, by which wretched as they are,
they are now ceazed.

This multitude and diversity of pain the holy Scripture expresses, where it
is said; That in hell shall be hunger and thirst, complaint and gnashings of
teeth, doleful swords, spyrits created to do vengance, worms, serpents,
scorpions, wormwood, water mixed with gall, spirits of tempests, and such like,
by which is signified the multitude of the terrible and horrible punishments,
which are ordained for the damned in this Lake. Furthermore, in this place,
there shall be darkness as well interior as exterior, as well ^n the soul as in the
body, which shall be thicker and darker the^ those of Egypt, Exodus 10.
of which the Scripture ^aith, that they might be felt with ^he hands. There
shall be fire, not such as ours is, which burns but for a time, and after a
little while wanting fuel^ is suddenly extinguished, but it shall be such a fire
as is agreeable with the place, which shall infinitely afflict, and never cease
burning. If therefore all these things be true, how can it be that all they
that believe and confess no less, can live in such unspeakable carelessness,
and slothfulnes? What may the trouble be, what labor so infinite, that a man
would not willingly sustain* that he might at leastwise escape the least of
these forenamed torments? why therefore to avoid this great and eternal evil,
do we refuse a little, and that pleasant labor, such as is the following of
virtue?

Truly this one thing were sufficient to him that seriously considered, and
fixed his whole mind and thought hereof, to drive him into a swound, and draw
him into melancholy. And if in so great torments, there were at the least some
hope of relief or decreement, the damned might have some consolation, bu^ none
of these things are granted the^. For th^re the gates shall be perpetu^lly shut
by which either consolation, or the weakest hope may happily enter. In all the
calamities of this world, there is always some refuge found out, whereby those
tha^ suffer, (at leastwise sometimes) receive some consolation: now reason,
now time, now friends* now others that have suffered the like mishaps, now at
least-wi^e some hope of end, yields the patient some abbridgment of his
dolor: But only in this kind of torments, the gates are wholly shut, all the
entrances of consolation are intercepted; so that there is no means whereby
those wretches may expect any refreshment or help, neither from heaven, nor
from earth, nor from things present, neither things to come, neither from any
other thing. But whether soever they turn their eyes, they shall see the
arrows shot against them, and shall suppose that all creatures have conspired
against them: Yea, they shall be cruel hangmen and tormen^ors to themselves.
This is the cala^itie, this is the grief and perplexity which makes those
reprobate and ^nhappy men to lament and say by ^he Prophet. The pains of death
^aue compassed me round about, Psalm. 114.
and the p^rrils of hell have found me out. For on what side soever they tu^ne
their eyes, they shall find new causes o^ grief, but no conso^ation.

The Evangelist Mathewe says, that those Virgins which were in a read^nes^e,
Math. 25.
entered into the Bridegroomes house, and that suddenly the door was shut. O
perpetual lo^king up* o sempiternall prison, o g^te which shall never be
opened. As if it were said, the gate of pardon is shut up, the gate of
indulgence, the gate of mercy, the gate of consolation, the gate of
intercession, the gate of hope, the gate of grace; and to conclude the gate of
all goodness is shut. Six days and no more in times past, Exodus 16.
did the children of Israel gather Manna, but in the seventh, that is, in the
Saboth there was none to be found: for which cause he ought to fast th^^ day,
who before had not taken ca^^ for the provision thereof.

For the cold (says the wiseman) the sluggard would not plowe, Prou. 20.
he shall therefore beg in Summer, and it shall not be given unto him. And in
another place, He that gathers in the harvest, Prou. 10.
is a wise son, but he that snorteth in the Summer is the son of confusion.
But what more greater confusion may there be found, then was that of the rich
glutton, who might have obtained the abundance of heaven, by the crommes that
fell from his table, and who unwilling to give a thing of so vile price, came
at last to such poverty, that in his extreme necessity he besought, and shall
always seek, and begging ask a drop of water, and it shall never be given
him. Always howling shall he cry out, Father Abraham, have mercy upon me, and
send Lazarus, that he may dippe the typ of his finger in water to cool my
tongue, because I am tormented in this flame.

What less or more abject thing might he ask? he durst not ask a ^^ssell or
pot of water, and that which is more to be admired at, he ^ayed not that he
should dip his ^^ole hand in water, but only the (...) of his finger, that
with it alone (...) might touch his tongue and be^^we the same, but he could
not ^^treat even that little thing.

Heere-vpon it appears how ^oselie the gate of all consolation is ^^utte,
and how universal this in^^^diction and excommunication is, ^here so slight a
petition could not (...) admitted. For that cause, whe^^er so ever they turn
their eyes, (...) what part soever they extend ^^eyr hands, they shall find
comfort (...) no place, no not a little.

For even as he that falling into (...) sea, encompassed by the waves, ^^^ding
no place where he may fix (...) foot, does often (but in vain) ^^etch his
hands on either side, be^^use he apprehends nothing but (...) licquid and
floating element, which d^ceaueth and deludeth him: (...) also these unhappy
wretches in ^^at place, when as they shall lie ^^owned in these seas of
infinite mi^^ries, agonizing, and fighting always with death, shall neither
fin^^ remedy, nor refreshment, whereupon they may ground themselves* This
shall be the greatest of all other pains, wherewith the damned shall be
tormented in this accu^se^ place. For if this pain had a determinate time
wherein it should take end, (although it were a thousand, or rather a thousand
thousand years) even by this it would breed some consolation; (for nothing is
gre^^ that has an end,) but it shall hau^ no end. And therefore their
punishment shall coequall the diuturnit^^ of almighty Gods eternity: and so
long shall their miseries and punishments continue, as Gods glory shall last,
and as long as GOD lives, so long shall they die: And when as God shall cease
to be that which he is, then they also shall no mo^^ suffer that which they
suffer.

O deadly life; o immort^l death; I know not by what nam^ to call thee,
whether life, or whethe^ death. If thou be life, why doo^^ thou kill? If
death, how do tho^ always endure? I will vouchsaf^ thee neither of these
names, for (...) ^oth of them, I mean death or life, ^^ere is some good to be
found: ^or in life there is rest, and in death (...) end, which two, bring no
little ^onsolation to such as be in trou^le, but thou have neither rest no^
and.

What therefore art thou? Thou (...) both the evil of Life, and the ^uill of
Death. For of Death, thou ^ast torments without end; And ^^om Life, thou
take continuance without any rest. GOD has de^riued Life and Death of the
goods that were in them, and what soever ^emaineth, he has powered it into
^hee, to the increase of pains and ^ormen^s, wherewith the most mise^able
damned wretches shall be tor^ented in hell. O bitter potion; o ^nuenomed
dregs of the cup of our Lord, Psalm* 74.
of which all the sinners of the earth shall drink.

For this cause (my brother) turn ^hou thine eyes and thy mind vp^on this
continuance, or rather E^ernitie, and like an undefiled crea^ure ruminate this
article of Eternity. But that thou may the better do it with a more
commodious method, consider diligently the pains and afflictions of some
(...) sick man, wher-with he is tormented for one night, especially, if (...)
grief be great, and the infirmi^^^ vehement. Thou shall see how often he
turns and returns himself in his bed; how many anxieties he has, what
torment, what agonies he suffers, how long the night seems unto him, how
often he tells the clock, and how insupportable fitts he suffers every
hour. But all these the desire of the morning temperates, which
notwithstanding very little or nothing at all can mittigate the least of his
dolors.

If those things we have spoken seem to be, and of many are accounted so
heinous, what shall they be that attend on sinners in that eternal night, which
shall neither have day, nor hope of succeeding morrow? O profound obscurity; o
eternal night, o night, cursed by the mouth of God and all Saints, in which
light shall be wanting, without ever arising, in which the light of the morning
shall never spring.

Now therefore contemplate what ^^nde of torment it shall be, to live ^^waies
in such a night, not lying in (...) ^oft bed, as the sick man does, but (...) a
furnace boiling with horrible ^ames; whose shoulders can su^^aine this burning
flame? O mat^^r worthy to be trembled at; what ^art so indurate and Adamantiue,
^^at melts not with the thought ^f these punishments? Which of ^ou, (says
GOD by the Prophet) ^ay dwell with devouring fire? or which of you shall dwell
with sem^ternal scorchings? If thou put but ^he typ of thy finger into the
fire, and ^^fferest it to be there during the re^etition of one Pater noster,
it will ^eem to be an intolerable torment, ^owe great then shall the torment
^ee, to be perpetually scorched in ^^y whole body and mind, in the ^idst of
that living fire, in compa^^son of which, our fire is but a pain^ed one? Is
there either Science or ^nderstanding in this world? Have ^^en a sound
judgment? Do they ^nderstand what this speech signifi^th? or do they happily
believe that these are Poetical fictions? Do they think that these things
do concern them? or rather suppose they that they are spoken by others, or
produced to delude the time? No brother, no, for nothing may be said of this
matter, which faith it self does not more manifestly testify.

But although those things which hitherto have been said, are sufficient to
engender great dread and fear in us, yet shall they be far more effectual,
if we well and advisedly consider the perpetuity of these punishments. For if
in them there were any term, or rem^ssion, either release might be had, at
least wise after many thousand, or many hundred thousand years, these
wretches should find out one certain period of their plagues: But why talk I
of eternity, which admits no other term, then that eternity which GOD
himself has? Which space is of such perpetuity, that (as a certain famous
doctor testifies) if any one of those damned, should but every year but shed
one material tear, there should more abundance of water (...) from his
eyes, then all this (...) world were able to contain in (...) concauitie: What
things may (...) spoken or thought more terri^^e?

And if all the torments which (...) in hell, were but the pricks of ^^all
pynnes, yet for their eternity ^ight they suffice, to move a man (...)
undertake with a joyful mind, all ^aynes, tribulations, crosses, and
^hatsoeuer misery is in this world, (...) leastwise to fly these everlasting
^^agues. O if that eternity did al^ayes dwell and abide in thy mind, ^ow
profitable should it be unto ^hee?

It is reported of a certain man ^^udious of worldly vanities, who ^alling
sometimes into the remem^rance of that eternity, astonished (...) a thing ^o
diuturnal, that shall have (...) end, after this manner phyloso^hied with
himself. There cannot (...) man be found in this world, of ^econciled
judgment, that would ^ccept the Emperie of the whole ^orld under that
condition, that for ^hirtie or forty years space, he might lie at his
pleasure in a soft bed decked with roses and (...) flowers; which if it be
so, what fo^^lie? what frenzy? what madness (...) that of men, to desire to
embr^^^ for a thing of small moment, a b^^^ning bed, in which they shall
(...) scorched eternally?

This only consideration was (...) profitable to that man, and wrough^ so
great fruit in him, that presently forsaking vice, he addicted himself to
virtues, and in short time (...) profited in them, that he became (...) holy
man, and a Prelate of t^^ Church. What will these lovers (...) the world say,
that for the buzzing of one gnat pass whole nights wit^ out sleep, when they
shall see the^ selves laid along in this bed of bu^^ning fire, and scorched on
every sid^ with living flames, and that not (...) a small time, as for one
nigh^ month, or years space, but for ever and ever.

Such sort of people the Proph^^ Esaias speaks to in these words* Which of
you can dwell with devouring fire? Esaias, 33.
which of you (...) everlasting scorchings? VVhos^ shoulders shall be so
yron-proofe* ^ho can bear so great a burden, (...) long a time? O insensate
people, (...) men blinded by the ancient de^eauer, who by his subtilties
circum^ented the whole earth. What I ^ray you is more estranged from ^eason,
then that men should take ^^re for things of small consequence which pertain to
this life, and in a ^^ing of so much moment, are so ^^considerate, and
carelessly negli^ent?

If we see not these things, what ^hen shall we see? What shall we ^eare,
if we fear not these things? Or what shall we foresee, if we ^ore-see not
these things? And if ^his be thus, how can we but em^race virtues with all
alacrity, how ^ie or difficult so ever they be, that (...) least wise we may
fly these e^ills?

When therefore the torments and ^^eefes of which we entreat, are (...)
infinite means much more ^reeuous the^ any affliction orpaine ^n this life,
and in continuance of ^yme, without comparison more ^ong, and it is also
farrelesse that al^ighty God requires at our hands, what madness is that of
ours not to endure so small labors, and so sho^ molestations, by which we may
estewe eternal torments? Who is he that sees not at leastwise that this is
the greatest error of this world, yea, and intolerable madness? But the
fruit thereof shall be, that the man that will not deliver him self here, by
small labors of a penitent life, from so many mischiefs, shall there suffer
eternal torments, without any fruit or profit.

The figure hereof we have in the furnace which King Nabuchodonozer caused to
be kindled i^ Babylon, whose flame was extended above the Furnace nine and
forty cubits: but for the defect of one cubite, it attained not to the number
of fifty, which signifies the year of Iubile: that we may understand, that
those eternal flame of Babylon, that is hell, although ^boue measure they
burn, and cruelly torment the unhappy damned, yet shall they never come to
that, that they attain the grace of the true Iubile.

O punishment without fruit; o ^arren tears; o penalties hard and ^euere, yet
void of all hope and sol^^ce, how little, in comparison of that which the
damned endure ^here, if it had in this world been ^oluntarily undertaken,
might have ^reserued them from these evils?

Of this matter he purposelie ^reateth in his Memorial, the first ^art, chap.
1. and in his first book of prayer and meditation, the 5. tractate, and in the
book of the guide of a Sinner, cap. 10.

The preface of the Collector, upon the succedent chapters of the benefits of
GOD.

CHAP. 6.
ALthough Virtue be by it self prayse-woorthy, and without it nothing may be
laudable, neither may there be any thing more amiable, and that more allureth
men to good life then the same: yet so are the manners of this world corupted,
that the most part of men strive who shall outstrip other in the race of
iniquity: the desire of sin dail^e increases, and shamefastnes dail^^
decreaseth; and so is wickedness^ publicly set to sale, that it prevails in
all men's hearts, whereas innocence is not rare, but nothing a^ all. For which
cause, that which men ought to do willingly for the love of honesty and
virtue, to that now, by many reasons and arguments, promises and threatenings,
they are partly without intermission to be invited, partly to be compelled:
that leaving vices, they may follow virtues, and renouncing the world, with
more cleanness of life, they may wholly and only incline to the service of God.

Neither is virtue so weak, neither this matter so poor and naked, that it
wants diverse and effectual arguments to incite and persuade the performance
hereof. For whethe^ we consider things past, things present, or things to
come: all of these either allure or compel us to virtue and the service of
God. Of the future we have already spoken, whereon if a man will seriously
think, and like a clean beast chewe the and, he shall find sharp poynted
goades infixed thereby in his mind. To things present and past, pertain ^he
blessings of God, of which some we have already received, other^ome we
receive daily, all which both by their goodness compel us ^o obey God, except
we will be ingrate, and inuit us by their profit, that the streams of
benefits might flow more bountifully, which otherwise would be dried up. For
ingratitu^e, as S. Bernard testifies, is a burning wind, drying up the
fountains of piety, the dew of mercy, and the floods of grace. Yea, and when
a certain old Soldier being called in question, was in danger to loose his
cause, he publicly came to Augustus Caesar, praying him to stand by him in
his cause: Caesar gave him presently a selected advocate out of his company,
and commended the clyent unto him. Hereat the soldier cried out; But I Caesar
when thou were in danger in thy Actian war, ^ought not for a deputy, but
fought for thee in person, and therewith discovered his scarrs. Caesar was
heereat ashamed and undertook his cau^^, fearing least he should not only be
thought proud, but also ungrateful* Such impressions and motives, have the
memory of benefits received* If so great a Caesar were so much moved, by a
common soldiers wounds received in his behalf, that he rewarded one courtesy
with another, why should not, I say not the scarres, but the death also of so
great a Majesty whereby we are redeemed, prevail with us, most abject wretched
men? and this one is so great a benefit, as why should I speak of the others
which are infinite? Whether therefore we respect honesty and profit, whether
their contraries hereby we are invited, thereby enforced to follow Virtue,
and to addict our selves to the service of God.

But the divine benefits although they are infinite, yet may they be reduced
unto five kinds, namely: Creation, Conservation, Redemption, Justification,
and Predestination: Of which five kinds of benefits we will orderly entreat.
For this consideration is profitable for diverse causes, especially for three,
which are thus rehearsed by our Author.

If we may believe Aristotle, goodness is amiable by it self, Out of the 7.
tract. lib. 1. of prayer and meditation.
for every one is diligently fixed on the love of himself. As therefore men
by natural inclination are lovers of themselves, and of their own profit, so
when they manifestly perceive that all that which they have, is of the meare
liberality and voluntary gift of God himself, and their eternal Benefactor,
they are suddenly inclined to the love of him, from whom they know their
graces are received. Hence it is, that amongst all considerations which are
auailable toward the attainement of the love of GOD, this is most effectual,
which sets before our eyes the d^uine benefits. For every seue^all benefit
received by us, is as it were a Furnace or burning fire, kindling by his clear
flames, the love of almighty GOD in us. And consequently, to meditate on many
benefits, is to kindle many fires, by whose ardent heat, our hearts are more
and more inflamed with the love of God.

For this consideration is profitable, to the end that a man desirous to serve
God, may be the more excited to his service, and become more forward, when he
shall consider the great obligation whereby he is tye^ by so many benefits
which he hat^ received from God For if a Parra^, a Lark, and other birds and
beasts, do for this cause (no otherwise then if they were beasts endued with
reason) answer them, and obey them in all those things which they are
commanded to do? How more requisite is it that they do the like, who have
received far more benefits, and have greater judgment to acknowledge the
same. For when a man with great attention reckons up with himself of the one
part, the multitude of the benefits which he has received from God, and on
the other part calls to remembrance the multitude of sins by which he
requiteth the divine bounty, how can he but blush? how can he but setting
the white by the black, know which is the better? that is, not understand,
the greatness of his malice, compared with the greatness of Gods goodness, which
bounty has not so many years intermitted to do good unto him, that has
never ceased to persevere in wickedness.

The Argument.
By reason of the benefits of our creation, we are bound to serve God in body
and soul: For according to the law, a man owes all that which he has
received, to him from whom he has received it. God created the body and the
soul, he created us men, and to an excellent end. Besides, he not only
created us, but does daily perfect us: For every thing that* has his
beginning, must ta^e his perfection from thence whence h^ began; and hence
grows the ob^igation.

CHAP. 7.
THE first of the benefits is creation, of which, since it is notorious to all
men, I will only enforce this, that a man for this only cause is bound wholly
to serve and honor God who created him. For according to the law, a man is
debtor for all that which he has received: when therefore by this benefit he
has received his being, that is, his body with all his senses, and his soul
with all her powers* It follows, that he ought to employ all these things in
the service of his maker, except he will be accounted a thief and ungrateful
man toward him, by who^ he has bin blessed by so many benefits. For if a man
sh^^d build a house, should it not serve him that builded (...) and if any one
plant a vinyard, who shall gather the grape* shall it not be he yt planted the
vine* and if the Father have a Son, to who^ shall he rather do service, then to
his father who begot him. For this cause it is that the law says, that it
cann^^ be imagined how much autho^it^ the father has over his son, which ^o
far extends it self, that the father being in necessity, may lawfully ^^ll
his son: for in respect of that, that he gave his son that being which he
has, the father likewise has gotten that power over him that it is lawful
for him to do with his son what him l^st. If therefore so great be the dominion,
and the authority so authentic, which the father has over his son; what
prerogative shall his be, from who^ the being of al parents are derived* as
well in heaven as in earth? And if they (as Seneca says) who recea^e a good
turn, ought to imitate a fertile field, yt yields much more the it received;
how can we answer God after this manner of gratuity, when as we cannot yield
him more, then we have received from him, although we gave it him also? And if
^he which gives not more the^ he received, observes not this law; Honor is
due to God, because he is our Father.
what shall we say of him, that gives less, then yt which was bestowed on him?
And if (as Aristotle testifies) we can not equiual^ently yield recompense to
the gods and our parents; how shall we equ^l the blessings of god, which has
bestowed more upon us, then all the fathers wc are in the world? And if it be a
heinous offense for a son to be disobedient to his father, what impiety shall it
be to rebel against god, who under so many bounties is our father? yea, and in
comparison of who^, no man amongst men deserves the name of a father? This is
yt which justly he expostulateth by his prophet. If therefore I be your Father
(says he) where is mine honor? Mala. 1.
and if I be your Lord, where is my fear* Against the same ingratitude
another prophet inueieth in these words. Wicked and perverse generation, will thou requite thy Lord God thus, thou foolish and insensate people? what is he
not thy Father, wh^ possessed thee, and created thee?

These are they that lift not up their eyes to heaven, neither behold
themselves, being forgetful of them ^elues. For if they did behold them
s^lu^s, they would severally ask of themselves, and endeavor to know, what is
their first original, what the^r first beginning; that is, of whom they were
made, and to what end they were created. By the consideration of his own
creation, a man grows into the knowledge of the Creator.
For by the knowledge thereof, they should at last attain the knowledge of
that which in deed they ought to do. And because men do it not, they live as
if begotten of themselves.

After which manner lived that accursed King of Egypt, whom God threatened by
his Prophet saying: Behold, I come to thee Pharao king of Egypt, Ezechiel, 29.
thou great Dragon, that lie in the midst of thy floods, and say; It is my
flood, and I made it for m^ self. After this manner speak ^ll they, who
forgetting their Creator, as that created by themselves, do not acknowledge
their maker. B^tter did S. Angustine, who by ^he knowledge of his beginning,
attayn^d the not^ce of his Creator* saying in on^ of his private M^ditations;
And I r^turn^d to my self and I en^^^ed into my self, Aug. Soliloq. cap. 31.
and I ^ayd to my ^^l^e, What art thou? and I aun^^er^d my self, a reasonable
and mort^ll man* and I began to discuss that that was, and said: Whence comes
this so named creature o my Lord God? whence but from thee? Thou made me, and
not I my self. Who art thou? Even he by whom I live, he by whom all things
live. Who art thou? Thou Lord my God, true, only, omnipotent, and eternal*
that always live, and nothing dies in thee: Tell me thine humble servant my
God, tell thou merciful, to me a miscreant; tell I pray thee for thy mercy
sake whence is this living creature, but of thee? Shall any man be the maker of
his self? is life and being drawn from any other but thy self? Art not thou
the chief good; from whence all being is? For whatsoever is, is from thee,
because without thee, there is nothing. Art thou not the fountain of life,
from whom flows all life? For what so ever lives, lives by thee, because
without thee nothing lives. Thou therefore Lord made all things: Shall I
then ask who made me? Thou Lord made me, without whom nothing is made. Thou
art my maker, I thy workmanship. I give thee thanks o Lord my God, by whom I
live, and by whom all things live. I give thee thanks o my Creator; because
thy hands made me, and fashioned me. I give thee thanks, my light, because
thou have illuminated me, and I have found thee, and my self.

When therefore thou layest in this confusion, darkness, and profundity of
nullity (as it be said) it pleased the divine bounty and mer^cie, without any
merit of thine, of his mere grace, to show in thee his virtue, and
omnipotency, and by his mighty hand to take thee out of th^se obscurities, and
that depth of confusion, to bring thee from not being, to a being: and ^o
create thee, that thou might be a ^ubstance. Yet would he not (as
tes^i^ieth Saint Augustine) that thou should be made like a stone, like a
bird, or like a serpent; but according to the similitude of a man, which is
the noblest of all the creatures of the world. He gave unto thee, that being
which now thou art; he composed and comp^cted thy body with a certain
singular harmony, and adorned all the parts therefore, as well the members, as
the senses; with so admirable perfection and providence; that ea^h one of them
(if it be well looked into) are the arguments of great mi^acle, and greater
benefits. This is that benefitte which blessed Job acknowledged with an
humble heart, when he said: Thy hands made me (o Lord) and fashioned me in
every part. Remember (I pray thee) that thou made me as of dirt, and shall
reduce me into ashes; With skin and flesh have thou clothed me, with bones
and nerves thou compactedst me* life and mercy thou gave me, and the
visitation has kept my spirit? But what shall I say of the nobility of thy
soul, and the excellency of the end, for which it was created; and of the
image and capacity that it has? The image thereof, is the image of God
himself. For there is not any thing to be found upon the earth more like to
God, and by which we grow more easily and manifestly into the knowledge of
God, then is man's soul. For which cause those ancient Philosophers, but
especially Anaxagoras, ^^y God was called a Mind by the Philosophers.
found out no other name that becam God more, then that they called him Mind;
which is naught else, then if they should have said a reasonable soul, ^^y the
substance of the soul is hardly understood
and that for the great similitude which they found between God and the
soul. Heere-vpon it grows, that the essence or substance of the soul can be
comprehended by no understanding, for in that it is so like the d^uine
substance, which since in this life cannot be understood; no otherwise may the
other be understood or comprehended.

Besides, the end to which so noble a creature was made, is every way
correspondent to the nobility thereof: For it is most certain that the soul
was created, that it might be pertaker of incomprehensible glory, and divine
felicity; that it might dwell in the house of God, enjoy the same goods with
God, and rejoice with the same joy he does, and be clothed with the same
garment of immortality, and reign with him for ever. And from hence draws
the soul that admirable capacity which she has, which is so great, that all
creatures, and the riches of this world gathered in one, are not sufficient, to
fill the bosom of the capacity thereof; yea, so far are they from filling
it, as is a grain of millet in respect of the engine of the whole world.

T^ll me therefore, o my brother, what shall we return our Lord for ^o great a
benefit? what may suffi^e ^o recompense our good God for (...) much goodness? If
we are much indebted to our carnal parents, because in some respects they
were coactours in the accomplishment, and compacting of this our body; how much
more stand we bound to our eternal Father, who with them formed our bodies,
and without them our souls? our soul, I say, which by many degrees is more
noble, and excellent then our body, and our body should be nothing, but a very
stinking dunghill? What else are the parents, but certain instruments by whose
weak help God builds this body. If therefore thou owe so much to the
means, how much shall thou owe to the work-maister that made it? and if thou
acknowledgest thy self to be indebted to him, that only in one part of the
work showed himself industrious, how much shall thou be indebted to him that
consumated the whole work. If the sword be in such honor with thee, whereby
the City was overcome, in what esteem shall the King himself be that
overcame it?

For it is to be understood, that things which are borne according to our
common manner of speaking, are not straight bred in all their perfection. For
they have many things perfect, yet are there many things defective in them,
which after are perfected. But that perfection must he add who beg^nne the
work: So that to the cause that gave the beginning of bee^ng, it pertayneth
also to give the complement of the thing being.

Hence it is, that all effects in their kind, are converted to their causes,
and from them receive their last perfections. The plants, labor, in what they
may to seek the sun, and that they may fix their roots in the earth, which
brought them foo^th: The fishes also issue not from the water, which ingend^red
them: The Chicken excluded from his egg, presently clicketh her self under
the wings of a Hen, and follovveth her wheth^r so-euer she goes. The like
does the Lamb, which is no sooner eaned, but that presently it hastneth to
the dugge of the Ewe: and if a thousand sheep were of the same fleece and
color: yet doo^^ he know his proper dam, and with her goes always, as if he
said. From hence I have received what I have, hence will I fetch that which I
want. That almost in all natural things is of force, and amongst the
artificial also it would grow in use, if they had either sense or motion. If a
Paynter in finishing a picture, should leave the eyes imperfect, and if the
said picture might have understanding, or were admonished of that which was
wanting in it, what think thou it would do? whether would it go? sure it
is, it would not repair to the Palace of the King, or to any other Prince;
for they cannot satisfy his desire; but i^ would return to the house of the
first work-maister, and there would request him to make it perfect, and
consumate the work which he had b^gun.

Tell me ^ reasonable man, wha^ cause there is thou should not do that which
unreasonable creatures do? For thou art not as yet perfect, many things are
defective in thee, thou want many things as yet before thou be complete and
perfect. The first pattern (as they say) is but rough-hewd; the beauty as yet,
and the elegancie of the work is wanting, which the continual appetite of
nature it self does most openly approve, which always as it were feeling her
necessity, does continually sigh, and carefully seek that which ^he wants.

God would prevent thee with famine, that being enforced by this necessity, he
might make thee enter by the right gate, and build thy self upon him therefore
that made thee. He would not there presently absolve thee from condition, or
make thee perfect, and for that cause he would not suddenly enritch thee. And
this would he thus do, not because he was a niggard, but because he was
bountiful, knowing that it was good for thee to be such a one: not that thou
should be poor, but humble: not that thou should always want, but that
thou should always have respect unto him. If therefore thou art blind,
poor, and ^ndigent in many things, why have ^hou not recourse to thy Father
that created thee? and to the Painter that shadowed thee, that he might perfect
that which is defect^ue? See how ready in this aff^ire king David was.

Thy hands (says he) made me, and created me, give me understanding that I
may learn thy commandments. Psalm. 118.
As if he said; Thy hands (^ Lord) made all that good which is in me, but this
thy work and pattern is not every ways absolute: The eyes of my mind
(amongst the rest) are not yet perfect; I have not yet the light, by means
whereof I may discern what I want, and what is necessary for me. But of whom
shall I require that which I want, but of him that gave that which I have? that
to whom the beginnings are due, the ends also may be devoted. Give me
therefore (o Lord) that light, illuminate the eyes of this blind borne, that
with them I may acknowledge thee, and so that may be perfected, which thou
begannest in me.

If therefore it pertain to our Lord to give this last perfection to the
understanding, it pertains also unto him to giu^ the same to the will, and
other powers of the soul, that by this means the form may be finished by the
same worke-man that began it.

The Argument.
As we are not created without God, so ^iue we not without him; for he that
created us, h^e likewise conserueth us: our whole life therefore depends on
him. He gives all good things to us; and drives all mischiefs from us: For
that cause all creatures visible and invisible are created to attend us. We
ought therefore in like sort to serve God for this benefit, as for the
precedent Which except we do; we are worse then beasts themselves, who
acknowledge their benefactours.

CHAP. 8.
THere are many mothers to be found, who think they have sufficiently
discharged their duty, if they bring forth their children with pain: so that
unwilling to take upon them the troubles of suckling and nursing them
themselves; they seek out ^ Nurse to whose charge they may commit the fruit
of their wombes. God deals not in like sort by us, but he undertakes in
himself all the trouble; so that he is both the mother which bear us, and
the nurse that suckleth us with the milk and benevolence of his providence.
Even as he witnes^eth by his Prophet saying: And I like the foster Father of
Ephraim, Ose, 11*
bear them in mine arms. He therefore that conserueth us, is the maker of us
all; and as without him nothing is made, so without h^s protection, all things
should necessarily perish and come to nothing; as it appears by the Psalms
144. and 103. Even as the whole motion of the clock depends on the wheels,
which by th^^ motion turns all the whole work* so that when one wheel
seaseth, a^^ the rest of the clock is at a stand, and out of frame: So the
whole mass of this great engine of the world, hangs only by the weight of
the Divine providence, so as if that cease, all the whole compact of this world
cease also.

But if thou will diligently consider, how many benefits shall thou find
included in this one, for even as many moments and points of time, as thy life
has had, has, and shall have, so many parts are there of this benefit, for
that in no one of these should thou either live or be, if God had turned his
eyes from thee. All creatures what soever they be in this world, are the parts
of this benefit, because we see all of them have their being, and aim to
this end, that they should serve and be accommodate to our use: for after this
manner the heaven is thine, and the earth, the Sun, the Moon, the stars;
the sea, fishes, birds, foure-footed beasts, trees, plants, and to speak in a
word, all things what soever are created, are devoted to thy service, which
in his Psalms the kingly prophet wondereth at. Psalm. 8.
Neither content that he had created all visible creatures to our use, his
further will was also, through his immesurable mercy, that all invisible
creatures, such as are those noble intelligences, which are always standing
before the presence of God, and behold his divine face, should serve for our
uses. For all the Angels, as S. Paul testifies, are administering spirits,
sent to take charge over those, who shall possess the heritage of salvation.
F^nally, all the world is employed in thy service, to the end that thou
likewise should be busied in the service of GOD, who would not that any
thing should be created, either above or under the heavens, that should not
serve for thy profit, that thou likewise might wholly serve under his empery.

What soever is found under heaven* Ex duce peccat li. 1. ca. 3
either is for the use of man, or to the use of that thing which serves man.
For although man (to speak properly) do not eat flies which fly in the air,
yet feeds he on other birds which are sustained by those flies, etc although
he eat not the weeds of the field, yet nourishes he himself by those diverse
kinds of beasts, which are pastured by those herbs. Turn and return thine
eyes into all the clymes and corners of the world, and thou shall see how
spacious the bounds are of thy riches, and how opulent thine inheritance is.
All that which walks on the earth, swymmeth in the Seas, flies in the air,
shines in the heavens, is thine. But all these are the benefits of god, and
the works of his providence, and ^he mirrors of his beauty; the testimonies of
his mercy, the sparks of his charity, and the exemplifications of his
liberality. See how many cryers and Preachers God sends unto thee, that thou
may know him. All that are in heaven and in earth, says S. Augustine, tell
me that I must love thee my God, and cease not to cry out the like to all men,
that no man may be excused.

If thou have ears to understand the voices of creatures, thou shall
manifestly perceive, how all of them do together teach thee to love GOD. For
all they in silence do protest that they were made for thy benefit, that thou
for thy self, and for them, should serve their and thine own Lord. The
heaven says: I give thee light by day, and by night through the ministry of
Moon and stars I prevent least thou should walk in darkness; and sundry
influences send I down, that diverse things may grow and increase, least thou
should die with famine. The Air says: I apply my self that thou may
breathe into me, I cool thee, I temperate thine internal heat, least it
consume thee: I have diverse kinds of byrds in me, that by their variety and
pulchritude should delight thine eyes, by their songs thine ears, and by their
taste thy palate.

The water says, I serve thee with my raines and showers, according to the
fixed seasons of the year: with my floods and fountains also that thou may
cool thee: I bring forth and nourish diverse kind of fishes, that they may
be meat for thee. I water thy seed, thy gardens and fruitful trees, that
thou might by all them be nourished. I yield thee passage through the midst
of the sea, that thou may traffic through the whole world, and that thou
might annexe to thy riches, the riches of another world or Hemisphere. What
think thou the earth will say, which is the common mother of all, and as it
were the shop or tavern of all things natural. She truly, and that not
without cause, shall say; I sustain thee, an unprofitable burden, I bear
thee like a mother in mine arms, I provide thee of necessaries, I sustain
thee with the fruits of my womb, I have communion or participation with all
other elements, with all the heavens, and from every one of the influences, do
I cull out and choose benefits to fructify for thee; I finally like a good
mother, neither in life nor in death forsake thee; for in life I suffer thee to
trample me with thy feet, I sustain thee; I give thee in death a place of
rest, and hide thee in my bowels. What need many words? The whole world with
a loud voice cries; Behold how my Lord and Creator entirely loves thee, who
has created me for thy love, and would that I should serve thee, and thou
likewise should serve him, that gave me to thee, and created thee for
himself.

These are (o man) the voices of all creatures: Consider now that there is none
so absurd deafnes, as to hea^ these voices, and to be ungrateful, for so many
and great benefits. If thou have received a good turn, pay thy due in
thanksgiving, that thou have no cause to be plagued with the scourge of
ingratitude: For every creature (as a certain Doctor has well noted) speaks
to a man in three words: Take, Restore, and Beware; That is, Take a benefit,
Restore that thou owe; Beware (except thou restore) the punishment. Is it
possible for thee (christian) that without intermission receiuest these
benefits, that sometimes thou sholdst not lift up thine eyes to heaven, that
thou may see who he is, who gives thee so many good things? Tell, if thou
should happen (being wearied in thy journey) to rest at the foot of some
Tower, greatly afflicted with hunger and thirst* and that there were one in the
tower should send thee meat and drink, as much as thou would require
could thou contain thy self, but that thou would lift up thine eyes
sometimes, that thou might see who he was, that had so well deserved at thy
hands? I think truly that thou could not. What else does god f^o^ his
highest heaven, but without intermission pour down his benefits upon thee.
Show me any thing, small or great, that is not given from above by the special
providence of God? why therefore sometimes liftest thou not up thy eyes to
heaven, that thou may acknowledge and love so liberal a Lord, and continual
benefactor? what other thing is intended by this carelesnes, but that men show
that they have laid aside the nature of men, and are degenerated into
unreasonable creatures? For in this we resemble hogs feeding under an oak, who
whilst their keeper ascends the tree, and with his whip or staff beats
down the acornes, are so much busied in eating, grunting, and beating one
another from the mast, as that they mark not who gave them the meat, neither
know they how to loop up, that they may see from whose hands that benefit
descended. O vngratful sons of Adam, who besides the light of reason, having
their shapes erect, and faces formed to behold the heavens, yet will not lift up
their eyes and minds that they may see and acknowledge their Benefactor, and
give him thanks for his goodness.

The law of gratuitie is so general, and so well liking unto GOD, that in the
very beasts themselves, he would this inclination should be imprinted, as we
may manifestly behold in sundry examples. What is more fierce then the Lion?
G^ll^us. lib. 5 cap. 14.
and yet Appian writes, that Androdus the D^ne, a Senators servant and a
fugitive, was many years nourished by a Lion, whose wounded foot he had
cured. The same man being long after that apprehended and brought to Rome, and
condemned to the beasts, and opposed to the said Lion, (which by good hap was
likewise taken and brought to Rome) was acknowledged and saved by him: and both
the slave and the Lion received their liberty, and always after lived together
in great amity. The like also Pliny writes, to have happened to Helpus the
Samian by a Lion. Plin. lib. 8. cap. 17.
Of the gratuity of horses, the said Pliny reports, that some there have
been that lamented their masters death, Plin. lib. 8. cap. 42.
and other-some that shed tears for their want. Lib. 8. ca. 40.
When King Nicomedes was slain, his horse starued himself to death. Some
revenged the death of their masters with striking and biting. These things
are of small moment, if we compare them with the fidelity, friendship, and
gratitude of dogs, of which Pliny reports admirable things.

If therefore beasts (in who^ there is no reason, but only a sparckle of a
certain natural instinct, by which they acknowledge a benefit) are so
grateful, and in all things that in the^ lies, help, obey, and serve their
benefactors; how can it be that a man, that is blessed with such a light to
acknowledge received benefits, should be so careless, and so slightly should
forget him, from whom so many benefits are derived? If it be such a heinous
offense not to love this Lord God, what shall it be to offend him, and to
violate his commandments? Can it be possible o man, that thou should have
hands to offend those hands which have been so liberal toward thee, that
even for thy sake, they have at the last been fastened to the Cross?

When that lascivious and shameless woman, allured the holy Prosphet Joseph to
adultery, and solicited him to be unfaithful to his Lord and master, the
chaste young man defended himself after this manner; Behold, my Master has
delivered all things into my hands, not knowing what he has in his house,
neither is there any thing which is not at my command, beside thy self, who
art his wife; how therefore can I do this wickedness, and sin against my
Master? As if he should say; If my Lord be so good and liberal toward me,
if he has committed all that is his to my trust, if he has dignified me
with such honor, how can I who am tied unto him by so many offices of kindness,
have my hands ready to offend so good a master? In which place it is to be
noted, that he was not content to say; It becomes me not to offend thee, or
I must not do it: but he said: How may I do this evil, and so forth:
signifying that the greatness of the benefits, ought not only to restrain the
will, but also the power, and take away the force likewise to offend our Lord
God in any thing.

That man had credited all that he had in Joseph's hand, and God has committed
that which he has to thee. Compare now those things that GOD has, with
those things which that man had, and see how far greater and more excellent
they be then those which the other possessed? Redoubled are those which thou
receauest from God, if thou compare them with that which Joseph received from
that man. Tell me (I pray thee,) what faculties? what riches has GOD, which
he has not communicated with thee? Heaven, earth, moon, stars, seas,
floods, fowls, fishes, trees, living creatures, to conclude, all that that is
found under heaven is in thy hands. What? not only those things which are under
heaven are in thy power, but also those things that are above the heavens,
namely, the glory of them, and eternal goodness.

All things are yours, says the Apostle, whether it be Paul, or Apollo, or
Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to
come; for all things are yours, that is, ordained for your salvation.

But what if I say, that thou have not only those things which are above the
heavens, but that the very Lord also of all heavens, is endowed to thee after a
thousand manners? He is given thee as a Father, as a Tutor, as a Savior, as a
Master; He is thy Physician, he is the reward of thy redemption; he is thy
example, thy help, thy remedy, and thy keeper. To conclude, the Father has
g^uen us his Son; the Son has deserved for us the holy ghost, whom the
Father and the Son sends; from whom all good gyfts proceed.

When therefore it is more true^ then truth, that God has delivered all that
he has into thy hands, how can it be that thou should have hands to
prouoake him? What think thou it may be suffered that thou should be
ingrate to such a gracious Father, and a Benefactor so liberal? Truly this
seems to be a most heinous offense? but if to this ingratitude thou annex
contempt of thy Benefactour, and injury or contempt how inexpiable a crime
will that be held? If that young man (of whom I spoke before) thought himself so
bound that he had no power to offend him* that had committed all the substance
of his house into his bands: How shall thou find any force in thy self to
offend him, who gave thee heaven, earth, and himself?

The Argument.
The benefit of Predestination is the first and greatest of all benefits, and
which is merely given gratis, without any precedent merit. The greatness
therefore of this benefit, and all those things which pertain thereunto,
greatly provoke a man to serve God, and to be dutiful unto him.

CHAP. 9.
AMongst the divine benefits also, Predestination or Election is to be
nu^bred, which as it is the first, so also it is the most excellentest, and
altogether necessary for our salvation. But this benefit is only theyrs whom
God has chosen from the beginning, to take possession of the eternal
beatitude and the heavenly kingdom. For which benefit, the Apostle, as well
for himself as for all the elect, gives him thanks in these words; Blessed
be God, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Ephesians. 1.
etc. who has predestined us in the adoption of his sons through Jesus
Christ. The kingly prophet commends that benefit likewise, when he says.
Blessed is he who^ thou have chosen, Psalm, 64
o lord, and have taken to inhabit in thy Courts. Deservedly therefore may
this benefit be called the benefit of benefits, and the grace of graces* It is
the grace of graces, because it is given before all merrite, of Gods only
infinite goodness and liberality: who setting a part injuries, nay rather
giving to every one su^f^cient help to salvation* imparteth more abundantly
to some the greatness of his mercy, like an absolute and liberal Lord of his
riches: And it is the benefit of benefits, not only because it is greater then
the rest, but for that it is the cause and foundation of all other benefits
also. For when as a man is chosen to glory, by means of this benefit, GOD
presently imparteth to him other benefits also, which are required toward the
attaynment of this glory: even as he testifies by his prophet, saying; In
perpetual charity have I loved thee, therefore in mercy have I drawn thee
unto me. Jeremy. 31.


That is, thou ought not to be ignorant, that I called thee to my grace,
that by the same thou might attain my glory. But the Apostle speaks of
this benefit more plainly, when he says; Because those whom he fore-knew,
those likewise he predestined, to be made conformable to the image of his
Son, that he might be the first begotten among many Brethren. Those
therefore whom he has predestined, those also he has called; and whom he
has called, them also has he justified: and those whom he has justified,
them also has he glorified.

The reason thereof is, that our Lord disposing all things sweetly and orderly,
after he has vouchsafed to choose any one to his glory, for that grace, he
conferreth diverse others; for he gives all those things which are pertinent
toward the attainment of that first grace. Even as the Father that brings up
his Son either to make him a Priest or a doctor, causes him from his
infancy to be exercised in Ecclesiastical affairs, or brought up in diuiner
studdies, and directs all the course of his life to that intended and
purposed end: So likewise that ete^nall Father, after he has chosen any man
to the communion of his glory, he directs him by his fatherly care to the
way of justice, which brings him to that glory, and in the same does
faithfully conduct his elected, till he attain the desired end. For this so
great and excellent benefit, they ought to yield our Lord thanks, who
acknowledge any notable fruit of this benefit in themselves. For let us grant
that this secret is hidden from mortal eyes, yet whereas certain signs of
justification are known, there also the signs of predestination or election
may be had. For as amongst the signs of justification, amendment of life is
not the least, so amongst the signs of election, the greatest is perseverance
in good life.

Which being thus, wey I pray thee with thy self, o man, under how great an
assurance our Lord holds thee bound unto him, for this immesurable benefit,
namely to be registered in that book, of which our Redeemer said to his
Apostles, Do not rejoice in this, that spirits are subjected unto you, but
rejoice because your names are written in the book of life. How immesurable
therefore is this benefit, to be beloved, and from eternity elected, from
which God was God? to rest in his most sweet bosom, even from the years of
eternity, to be accounted the adoptiue Son of God then, when as his natural
Son was begotten in the brightness of his Saints, who were present in his
divine understanding? Attentively therefore consider all the circumstances of
this election, and thou shall find every one of them to be singular benefits;
yea, and that great ones also, and such as tie thee under new couenaunts.
Consider

the more free it is, by so much the more holds it a man obliged.

Fifthly, the antiquity of this election is to be considered, for it began

Sixthly, the rarenes of the reward

In this consideration, a few things shall be found, which may be written, and
many things which may be weyed in mind, that the elected may be grateful to
our Lord God for the perticularitie of this benefit, which is so much the
greater, by how much the number of the elect is lesser, and of those which are
to be damned greater, the number of whom (as Solomon affirms) is infinite.

But if none of these things move thee, yet at leastwise let the greatness of
the expense, which our most liberal Lord had determined to make by reason of
this benefit, move thee. Such as is the life of his only begotten Son, and
his blood shed in the behalf of this benefit: who had decreed from
eternity, to send him into this world, that he might be the executor of this
divine determination. Which since it is so, what time shall be more convenient
and profitable, to consider so great mercy of GOD! What tongue shall more
plainly express the same? What heart with greater affection feel, and more
entire sweetness taste the same?

Finally, with what services may the same be recompensed? With what love may
a man answer this divine love? Who will be so ungrateful as to refuse now
at length to love him, of whom from eternity he has been beloved? Who
would change this friend for any other what soever?

Wherefore, since that in holy Scriptures, a friend of so many years is so
much praised and had in estimation, who would change the possession and grace
of so great a friend, for all the friends of the world? And if prescription
or possession of time, with memory gives him both right and authority who
has neither, what will this eternal possession do, by which our Lord is
possessed, that by the title of this friendship we may be reputed for his. By
these it appears, that there are no blessings to be found in this world,
wh^^^ ^ay deserve to be exchanged with these, neither are there so great evils
which are not to be endured for the love of these benefits.

Who (I pray you) is he could be so dull and inconsiderate, that being taught
by divine revelation, that a certain poor beggar seeking his living from door
to door, were after this manner predestinat by god, would not kiss the earth
whereon he troad? would not give him place? would not hu^bling himself on his
knees, with all humility, wish him al good, and gratify him in this manner; o
most happy, o most blessed, art thou one of that happy number of the elect?
shall thou rejoice amongst the blessed troops of Angels? shall thou sing that
celestial music? and possess that perpetual kingdom? sha^^ thou behold that
shining face of Christ? O happy is y^ day in which thou were borne, but much
more happy that, in which thou shall die to the world; for then shall tho^
begin to live the life everlasting. Happy the bread which thou eatest;
blessed the earth which thou treadest upon; for it bears an incomperable
treasure; Blessed the ^ribulations which thou suffer, and the necessity yt
ouer-presseth thee. For they open thee the way which ^eadeth thee to eternal
life: what cloud of calamities and tribulations shall there be so thick, which
shall not vanish under so great a hope?

These, and such like are the words we would use, and speak to any man who^
we certainly knew to be predestined. For if a certain princ^ that is like
to be heir of a great kingdom, passes by any plac^, all the inhabitants
there-abouts, make have to behold him; and they admire that blessed fortune
(according to the opinion of the world) that this young man has befaln him,
because he is born the heir of a kingdom. How much more therefore ought
men to admire this blessed lot? namely, that a man should be born, and
(without any of his merit) chosen, not to be a temporal king in this world,
but to reign in heaven with God himself* for ever and ever. By these things
therefore (my brother) thou may easily conceive the great bond whereby all the
elect are tied for this benefit to their Lord and Elector; from which let no
man suppose himself excluded, if he will do his duty, and not hinder himself.

Yea, it shall be needful (as Sa^^^ Peter warns) in all his works, to make
sure his vocation and election: for we are assured that he that does this shall
be saved; and we know also, that Gods grace and favor does never leave any
man, neither will hereafter leave any one destitute.

The Argument.
The benefit of Redemption exceeds all eloquence, and were rather to be
adored then expressed, rather men had need of some certain knowledge thereof.
Man by sin was made like unto the devil: GOD might have left him in
damnation like the devil, but he would not: He turned his wrath into mercy,
he sent not an Angel, but he himself coming after an unspeakable manner,
redeemed him. He was admirable in his coming, and for that man is much
indebted unto GOD, yet much more for the means of his redemption, which
comprehends the whole passion of Christ. Christ died not for one, but for
all, and this increases the debt.

CHAP. 10.
IT is recorded amongst ancient Writers, Ex duce peccat. li. 1. ca. 4
of a famous Painter, that depainting the funerals of a certain Kings
daughter, shaddowed about the circuit of the heirse, many of her kinsmen and
al^ies, standing with sad and afflicted looks, next them her mother more
pensive then the rest: but when he came to delineate the Father, he covered his
face with an artificial kind of shadow; expres^ing thereby that Art was
deficient in this place: by which new e invention he expessed the greatness of
the dolor. After the same manner, all our understanding, art, and eloquence are
defective, in declaring this unspeakable benefit of our redemption. For which
cause perhaps we might have done far better, if we had worshipped the same
with silence, that in some manner by this device we might express the greatness
thereof. The benefit of our creation is unspeakable, but of our Redemption more
admirable: for God created all things with the only beck of his will; b^^ for
man's redemption he travailed thirty and three years, he shed h^s blood,
neither had he either member or any sense which was not excruciate with a
particular grief. It seems therefore that an injury should be done to so
glorious a mystery, if any man should imagine that he could express the same
with humane tongue What therefore shall I do? shall I speak, or hold my
peace? I must not be sil^nt, and I cannot speak. How may it be that I should
conceal so immesurable mercy? and how may I express a mystery so sublime and
adorable? It is ingratitude to conceal it, and to speak thereof, it seems
rashness and presumption. For which cause I ^es^ech thee (o my God) that whilst
I am to speak according to my rude understanding, of this thy immesurable
glory, thy holy Spirit may move and moderate my tongue, like the pen of a
ready writer. After that man was created, and settled in the Paradise of
del^ghts, in high dignity and glor^, yea and by so much was bound to God by
straight bonds, by how much he had received more greater benefits at his
hands; he becam undutiful and rebellious* and of those things from which he
ought to have taken greater cause of love toward his Creator, of the same he
took greatest occasions to betray him. For that cause was he thrust out of
Paradise, and thrust in exile, yea and allotted to infernal pains; to the end
that he that had been^ made companion with the devil in sin, should be also
associate with him in punishment. Helizeus the prophet, said to his servant
Giezi, Thou have taken silver and rayments from Naaman, 4. Reg. 1.
therefore Naamans leprosy, shall cleave unto thee and thy seed for ever.
Such was the judgment of GOD against man, who when he had affected the goods
and riches of Lucifer, (namely his pride and ambition) it was just and
requisite that he should be infected with the leprosy of the same Lucifer,
which was the punishment of his pride. Behold therefore man made like unto the
devil.

Now the divine justice might have left man by all right in this miserable
estate, even as he left the devil without any contradiction and expostulation:
yet would he not do so, but rather did the contrary, chaning his wrath into
mercy, and by how much the more injury he had received, by so much the more
grace would he show his love to mankind. And whereas also he might have
repaired this ruin, by an Angel, o^ Archangel; he would com himself. But
how? in what form came he? and how redeemed he us? What human tongue will
express this unto us? When as he might have com in majesty and glory, he would
not, but he came in great humility and poverty. Christ established such
friendship betwixt God and us, that not only god forgave man all his sin,
received him into his favor, made him one and the same with him by a straight
co^nexion of love, but (that which exceeds all greatness) he made such a
similitude and correspondence betwixt himself and man's nature, that amongst
all things created, there might no such co^formity be found, as are the Deity
and humanity, for they are not one and the same only in love and grace, but
also in person.

Who durst ever but have hoped, that that so wide wound should have been closed
after this manner? who might ever have imagined, yt these two things* betwixt
which there was so much difference of nature and offense, should so closely be
united? not in one house, not at one table, not in one grace, but in one and
the same person? What two things may be thought more contrary the^ God and a
sinner, and what is more nearly annexed or more commixt, then God and man?
There is noth^^g more high then God (says S. B^^nard) and the^e is nothing
more ^ile and abject th^n du^t, of which man is fo^^ed. Notwithstanding, God
descended upon the earth, with such humility, and ascended with so much
sublimitie from the earth to God, that what soever God did, the same the earth
is said to have done, and whatsoever the earth suffered, that likewise God
suffered. Who would have said to a man when he was naked, and assertained that
he had incurd the displeasure of our Lord, when he sought retyring places in
Paradise wherein he might hide himself* who I say would then have said to him
that the time should one day com wherein this so vild substance should be united
with God in one and the same person? This union is so near and faithful, that
at such time as h^s humanity was to be dissolved, which was at the hour of his
passion, (...) was rather strengthened then weakened. Truly death might separate
the soul from the body, which was the union of nature: but neither could he
separate God from the soul, or draw him from the body; for such was the union
of the divine person, that what is apprehended once with so firm an union, it
never will forsake: And all these th^nges GOD would so do, that by this
benefit he might inflame us with more love toward him, and by this example,
more straightly oblige us unto him.

Now therefore, if thou art so much indebted to thy Redeemer, for that in his
own proper person he would come to redeem thee, how much owe thou for the
means it self, by which he redeemed thee? which means most assuredly was
mixed with mighty griefs and tribulations. Truly it is a great benefit if
any King should forgive a thief that punishment which he ought to suffer for
his offense. But that the king himself, should suffer himself to be tied to
the post, and receive the strokes upon his own shoulders, that should be an
unspeakable benefi^e, and a bounty beyond comparison.

Ah my Lord, for the love of me thou were borne in a stable, and l^^d in a
hard manger, for me were thou circumcized the eight day, for me flying into
Egypt thou were banished seven whole years, and for me thou sustainedst
diverse persecuons, and were provoked by diverse mockings and infinite injuries.
For my sake thou fastedst, watchedst, ranst hither and thither, sweatedst,
weptst, and enduredst all miseries in thine own experience, which my sins
had deserved* when as yet thou were without all sin, and deceit was not to
be found in thy lips; yea, when thou had not offended, but were offended:
thou for my sake were captive, and now presented before this, now before that
Judges trybunall seat: before them were thou falsely accused, beaten with
buffetings, spet upon, mocked, whipped, crowned with thorns provoked with
blasphemies, and lastly, crucified.

Out of his 1. book of pray^r and (...) 3.
Lift up the eyes of thy mind to the cross of his passion, and see the
strokes, behold the wounds* reg^rd the dolours, which the Lord of Majesty
suffered there; because every one of the wounds, each stripe, and agony are
several benefits, and they most mighty ones: Behold that innocent body wholly
besprinkled with blood, full of wounds and stripes, altogether torn, bruised,
and broaken: behold the blood flowing from every side. See that most holy
head through too much weight bending and reposing on his shoulders: See that
divine face, which the Angels desire to look upon, how defiled it is, watered
with rivers of purple blood, and one the one side fair and gracious, on the
other, foul and bespotted. Behold the browe of that fair young man, which was
wont to delight the eyes of all those that beheld him, how now it has lost
the flower of all his favor. Behold the Nazarean, purer then milk, Thenor. 4.
crimsonner then old Iuorie, fairer then the Sapphire. His face is more black
then coals, so that his own friends know him not; Look upon his pale mouth,
his blew lips, his tongue almost dumb, how he moves them to obtain
remission and indulgence, even for those that ^orment him. Finally, fix thine
eyes upon all parts of his body, and thou shall not see any one of them free
from stripes and dolours. From the sole of the foot, to the ver^e crown of
the head, there is nothing whole in him, every where mays^ thou behold wounds*
strokes, and blewnesse. That most fair browe, and eyes clearer then the
sun, are now obscured, blind, and dead, at the instant conflict of death. His
ears which were wont to hear the heavenly H^mnes, now l^sten the slanders,
reproaches, and blasphemies of sinners; His well formed arms, and so long, as
that they can encompasse the whole world, are now ou^ of joint, and distended
upon the cross^. Those hands which created the heavens, and never did man
injury, are pierced with rough nails, and affixed to the cross His feet
which walked not in the ways of ^inners, are mortally wounded and transfixed.
And above all this, behold on what bed he lies, and where that celestial
Spouse sleeps a^ noone-dayes, how narrow it is, how hard it is, not yielding
him a place to rest or recline his head upon. O golden head, how do I see thee
for the love of me, so faint and wearied? O most holy body, conceived by the
holy Ghost, how do I see thee for my sake so cruelly wounded, and so hainously
handled? O sweet and amiable breast, what means this so deep wound? why is
this window opened? what means this abundant issue of blood? O wretch that I
am, how do I behold thee pierced for my love with so huge a spear? O rough
and ungentle cross stretched forth, relax thy bowels that that rigor may
relent which his nativity gave? O hard nails, do not crucify those his hands
and feet: Come rather to me, and wound my heart, for I am he who have
sinned, he has not offended. O good Jesus, what have thou to do with th se
dolours* what alliance is there twixt thee and this bitter death, these n^iles
this cross?

T^uly (says the Prophet) his bu^inesse is another man's, Esaias, 24.
his labor pertayneth unto him. For what thing is more ^lvenated and
^straunged from life then death? from glory, then punishment? from exceeding
sanctity and innocence, then the image and similitude of a sinner? Truly that
title of our Lord, and that figure is very far estranged from thee? Gene. 17.
O very Jacob, thou obtaynedst thy fathers blessing in another man's coat, and
a foreign habit; for assuming to thy self the similitude of a sinner, thou
have gotten the victory over sin.

Ex duce pe^^^t, lib. 1. cap. 4.
But if o man it shall seem unto thee that thou art not indebted so much to
God, by reason that he died not for thee only, but for all the sins of the
world, beware least thou be not deceived: for so dyed he for all, that he
died likewise for every one in particular. For all those for whom he suffered
are so subject to his infinite wisdom, and as if present object to his eyes,
as if all of them were comprehended in one. And with that his immeasurable
charity he embraces all in general, and every one in special, and so has he
shed his blood for all, as if for one. To conclude, so great was his charity,
that (as some Saints say) if one only amongst all men had been guilty, he would
for him also have ^^ffered all that, which he endured for the whole world.
Consider therefore and wey in thy mind, how much thou owe to this Lord, who
did so much for thee, and had done far more, if greater necessity had
required it. O heinous ingratitude, o hardness of man's heart? Truly thou art most
flinty, if thou art not affected with so many benefits, if for so many dowers
thou do not bestow thy self upon him. There is not any thing found in this
world ^o hard, which is not mollified by some cunning. Mettalls melt with
fire, and by the same iron is made ma^leable: The hardness of the Adamant is
broaken with Goats blood: But thou o heart of man, art harder then any stone,
harder then iron, harder then Adamant: when as neither the infernal fire can
break thy hardness, neither the cunning of the most merciful Father, mollify
thee, neither the blood of that immaculate Lamb, can make thee tractable.

Saint Ambrose writes of a certain dog, that barking and howling a whole
night long, lamented his Master, who was slain by one of h^s enemies. In the
morning many men assembled about the course, and amongst the rest he also
arrived who had slain the man. The dog beholding the murderer, as^a^^ed him,
and l^aping upon him began to bite him; and by this means the offense of the
ma^queller was manifested. What will thou therefore say, o man, if a dog be
so faithful for a bitte of bread, and so entirely love his Master? Does
ingratitude so much please th^e, that in the law of gratuitie thou will suffer
thy self to be conquered by a dog?

And if this brute beast were incensed with so much ire against him that sl^w
his Master: why art not thou likewise incensed against those tha^ ^lew thy
Lord and Savior? Who are they? Forsooth thy sins were the causes of the
death of the Lord. These cruel executioners had n^uer had so much force or
power against Christ, except thy sins had armed them. Why art thou not
therefore angry, why whettest thou no^ thy fury against those that slew the
Lord? Why is not thy love increased toward him, when as thou see thy
Lord slain before th^ne own eyes, nay more for thy sake? Why art thou not
angry with thy sins, which put him to death? Especially, because thou know
that there was no other en^^ of all his savings, deeds, and ^o^m nts, then
that he might kindle in our hearts, a wrath and hatred ag^^nst sin.

He suff^red because he might slay (...) and that he might restrain ^he power
both of our hands and feet* hasting after iniquities, he would that his
hands should be fastened to the Cross. With what ^ace therefore dare thou
live so, that all Christ's labors and sweats shall be spent in vain for thee,
whilst thou will remain in that servitude, from which he delivered thee by the
shedding of his precious blood. It cannot be but thou should tremble at the
very naming of sin, when as thou see that God suffered most terrible
torments, to the end that he might destroy and abollish the same? What could
he do more to with-drawe men headlong running after wickedness, then that GOD
himself should be sent to encounter them hanging on a Cross, who will be so
rash that he dare offend God, when before him he sees both Paradise open,
and hell with gaping mouth? yea, and which is far greater then both to behold
God hanging on a cross* He that is not moved with this spectacle, I know not
truly by what other thing he will be moved.

All this Chapter is taken partly out of the first book of the Guide of a
sinner, chap. 4, partly out of the first of Prayer and Meditation, the 3, chap.
Of the 7. tractate, on which places he purposely handles our redemption. Thou
shall find many things also touching this matter in the life of Christ, and in
the book of the Catechism.

The Argument.
Without the benefit of Justification all other benefits had nothing at all
profited us, nay rather they had done us harm. Now Justification is the work
of the holy Ghost, without which no man can be saved. Justification therefore
is a great bond of our duty; especially because it concludes in it self so
many and so great goods; which are rehearsed in this Chapter. Moreover,
Justification is a greater benefitte then Creation. And how a man may gather
by certain conjectures, that he is justified.

CHAP. 11.
NOthing at all had the hethe^to rehearsed benefits profited us, if the
blessings of vocation, and justification, and sanctification had not followed.
For that I may ouerpasse the other with silence, which had been in vain, and
to our great mischief, what use had there been of that only and noble
benefit of our redemption, if justification had not been annexed? For even as
the plaster is of no use, if it be not applied to the wound, or place
affected, ^o had there been no profit of this celestial medicine, except by
the means of this benefitte it had be^ne applied. This office principally
pertayneth to the holy Ghost, to whom man's sanct^fication also ^s attributed.
Now a man is justified when by the virtue of this divine spirit the chains and
s^ares of sin being broken and rent a sunder, he escapes the dominion and
tyranny of the devil he is raised again from death to life, of a sinner he is
made just; and of the son of malediction, he is made the son of God: which
can no ways be done without the peculier help and succor of God, the which
our Lord testifies in express words; No man can come unto me, John, 6.
except my father draw him. Signifying hereby, that neither free will, nor
the forces of human nature, can of themselves deliver a man from sin, and
bring him unto grace: except the a^me of the divine power be assistant. Even as
a stone of his own^ nature falls always downwardes, neither can tend
vpwardes without external aid: So also a man through the corruption of his
sin, always tends downward, that is, falls in love, and desires
earthly things. But if he be to be erected and lifted upwards* that is, raised
to love and supernatural desire, he had need of the right hand of the
omnipotent and divine help.

Many benfites are contained in this one. When as therefore the consideration
of this benefit, vehemently inciteth a man to gratitude, and desire of virtue,
I will here by the way express the great profits which this one only good
is wont to bring with it.

First, by it a man is reconciled to

Therefore says the Prophet David, Psalm. 5.
Thou hate all those that work iniq^ity, thou shall destroy them that speak
lies. This is the fountain ^oote, and original of all evils. From this so
perilous evil, we are delivered by y^ means of Justification, by which we are
reconciled to God, and of his enemies made his friends; and that not in the
common degree of friendship, but in the highest degree that may be found, which
is of the father toward his son. This friendship Saint John Evangelist
deservedly commends, when he says. Behold what charity God has showed you,
1, John. 3.
that you are both benamed, and be the sons of God* Not content to have said,
that we are named, he adds also that we be, that the pufilanimity and
little trust of men might manifestly know the beneficence and liberality of
God. And if in this world it be esteemed a thing of great moment, if any man
should be honored by his superiors, as by Bishops, Kings, Princes, or such
like Potentates: I pray you what shall it be to be well thought of by the
highest Prince, the supreme Father, and the greatest Lord: in comparison of
whom, all the principalities and dignities of this world, are as if they were
not?

Another benefit fore-passing the of eternal punishment, of which he was
guilty for his sins. Which how great a benefit it is, he aft^r a sort
knows, that has diligently ouer-reade the fifth chapter placed before, in
which we have rehearsed certain sorts of punishments. From all those
punishments God has delivered them, whom he has justified, all which after
they are reconciled, and received into his favor, are freed from that wrath
and pain of divine revenge.

Behold another benefit more spiritual, which is the reformation and his
opposite: it follows that by how much more our sins are multiplied* by so
much the powers of the soul are destroyed and troubled, not in themselves, but
in their toward workings. After this manner do sins make the soul
miserable, infirm, slow, and instable to all goodness, but ready and prompt to
all evil, they make her weak to resist temptations, and slow to walk the
way of the commandments of our Lord. They also deprive her of the true
liberty and dom^nion of the Spirit, and make her captive to the world, the
devil, the flesh and her own appetites: and after this manner, she lives in
harder captivity then that of Babylon or Egypt. Besides, all the spiritual
senses of the mind are made slow, so that they neither hear the voices and
divine inspirations: neither see the great eu^ls that are prepared for them,
neither smell the sweet odor of virtue, nor the worthy examples of the Saints,
nor taste how sweet our lord is, nor feel his scourges nor acknowledge his
benefits by which he provoke the^ to love. And besides all this, they take
away the peace and joy of conscience, extinguish the feruor of the Spirit, and
leave a man defiled, loathsome, deformed, and abominable in the sight of God
and all his Saints. This benefit delivers us from all these evils. For the
Abiss of divine mercy, is not content to have pardoned our sins, and to have
received man into his favor, except he also expel all those evils which
sins bring with them, reforming and renewing our inward man. After this
manner he heals our wounds, he washes our uncleanness, he breaks the
bonds of sinners, destroys the yoke of evil desires, delivers us from the
servitude of the devil, mittigateth the fury of our perverse affections, and
restores unto us the true liberty and pulchritude of the soul, gives us peace
and joy of good conscience, quickneth our interior senses* and makes them
prompt to do all goodness, and slow to all wickedness. He makes them strong to
resist temptations of the devil, and endoweth them with good works. To
conclude, so absolutely renueth he and repaireth he our interior man with all
his powers; as the Apostle fears not to call such kind of men, justified,
renewed, or rather new^ creatures. This renouation is so great, that when it is
given by Baptism, it is called regeneration, and when it is restored by
repentance, it is called resurrection: not only because the soul is raised
from the death of sin, to the life of grace; but because in a certain manner
it imitateth the beauty of the future resurrection. And that is so true, that
no tongue of man is sufficient to express the beauty of the justified soul;
but only that spirit knows this, that beautifieth the same, and makes it his
temple, and lodges himself in it.

Wherefore if thou compare all the riches of this world, all his honors, all
his natural graces, and all his acquired virtues, with the beauty and riches
of the soul that is justified, all of them shall seem most obscure and vild
in comparison thereof. For as great difference as there is betwixt heaven and
earth, between the spirit and the body, between eternity and time, so great
also is found betwixt the life of grace, and the life of nature, between the
beauty of the soul, and of the body, betwixt the interior and exterior riches,
between spiritual and natural fortitude. For all these are circumscribed by
certain terms, are temporal, and seem only fair to the out ward eye, to
which the general concourse of God is sufficient, but to those other, a
particular and supernatural concourse is required: neither can they be called
temporal, where as they bring to eternity, neither any ways termed finite,
because they deserve God, in whose eyes they are so precious, and of such
value, that by their beauty they provoke God himself to love. But whereas God
might work all these things by his only presence, he would not do it; but
it pleased him to adorn the soul with infused virtues, and with the 7. dowers
of the holy Spirit; with which, not onel^ the very essence of the soul it
self but also all the powers thereof are invested and adorned with these
divine habits.

Besides all these divine benefits, that eternal and infinite goodness of
God annexeth an other, namely, the presence of the holy ghost, or rather, of
the whole blessed Trinity, which enters into the justified soul, and comes
to inhabit in the same, that it may teach her how to use in due sort so great
riches.

Like to a good Father, who not content to have given his riches to his son,
gives him a tutor also, who knows how to administer them well. So that even
as in the soul of a sinner, Vipers, Dragons, and Serpents inhabit, who are
the multitude of malignant spirits, who have taken up their lodging in such a
soul, Math. 12,
as our Savior in S. Matthew affirms: So contrariwise into the justified
soul, the holy Ghost, with the whole sacred Trinity do enter, and casting
out all monsters and infernal beasts, Luke, 11.
consecrateth the same for a temple for himself, and places his seat there.
As our Lord himself expressly testifies in the gospel written by Saint John,
John, 14.
saying; If any man love me, he will observe my sayings, and my Father shall
love him, and we will com unto him, and make our mansion with him.

By virtue of these words, all the Doctors, as well Ecclesiastical as
Scholasticall, do confess that the holy Ghost himself, truly and after a
certain special manner, does dwell in the justified soul, distinguishing
betwixt the holy ghost and his gyfts; saying moreover, that not only these
gifts of the holy Ghost ^re given, but yt the holy ghost also, gives himself,
who entering into this soul, makes her his temple, and habitation, fixing his
seat in ^he same. He therefore purges ^he same, sanctifies and decketh her
with his virtues, that she may be a sufficient mansion wherein he may
inhabit.

The above named benefits suffice

Hence do orher, and they very great prerogatives and excellencies arise. For
hence comes it that Gods only Son loves them, as his own members, and
has no less care of them then of himself: he is no less solicitous for
them, then for his own members, without intermission, he powers into them
his virtues, as the head into his members. Finally, the etern^^l Father
beholds them with fauo^rable eyes, no otherwise then the living members of
his only begotten Son, united, and with him concorporate, by the
participation of his Spirit; and therefore their ac^^ons are grateful and
pleasing, as (...) were the actions of the living members of his Son, who
works (...) them all goodness. From the (...) dignity it proceeds, that
when as these justified require favor at God hands, they demand it with gr^^t
confidence: for they know, th^^ they ask the same, not for themselves only,
but also for the (...) of GOD himself, who in them and with them is
continually honored.

Neither do the divine benefits here take their end, for to all the
fore-sayd graces this is annexed at the last; to which all the other are
disposed, namely, the right and possession of eternal life, which is given to
the justified. For even as that our most mighty Lord, in whom at once
infinite justice and mercies do shine* (...) adiudgeth all sinners which do
not repent them to eternal punishments: so assumeth he all truly penitent to
eternal life.

These the^ are the benefit^, which that only benefit of Justification
comprehends in it self: which Justification, August. (...) John.
Saint Augustine esteems more then Creation: for God created heaven and earth
by his only word; but that he might truly sanctify man, he (...) his blood,
and suffered so many* and so diverse tortures for him. If therefore we are
indebted to this God, such and so many ways for our creation, how much more
owe we him, for our sanctification? which benefit, by how much more greater
labors and afflictions it is attained, by so much the more it obliges us.

But although a man do not yet evidently know whether he be truly justified,
yet every one may have great co^iectures of his justification, amongst the
which this is not the least, namely, the ame^dment of life, when as he that
was wont to perpetrate a thousand sins in one day, now commits not one. He
that is such a one, let him remember with what just cause he is bound to serve
such a sanctifier, who redeemed him, and delivered him from so many evils, and
stored him with so many blessings as are hitherto rehea^sed. And if any man yet
be entangled in the ungracious race of his life, I know not by what means God
may more move him to forsake that condition, then if he set before his eyes,
all the ^^^lls, incommodities, and perrils, which sins bring with them, which
a little before have been numbered up by us: a^ also in showing him the
treasure of great benefits, which spring from this incomparable blessing.

The Argument.
The graces and gifts of the Holy Ghost, and those wonderful effects which
they work in us, are such and so many, that whether a man will or no, except
he will be altogether ungrateful, he ought in leaving his loose behavior,
to intend the service of God. No less are the benefits of Baptism, and most
great bounties of the Sacrament of the Eucharist; all which inuit us to the
amendment of our lives.

CHAP. 12.
THose things which we have hitherto spoken, comprehend not as yet all those
kinds of benefits which the holy ghost works in the soul of a man that is
justified, neither is Gods liberality concluded in those terms. For it
suffiseth not the divine Spirit to have led man in by the gate of justice, but
after that man has entered, he is likewise assisted by the same Spirit, and is
led by the hand into all his ways, till the waves of this stormy sea being
ouer-ceased, he attain safe and secure to the haven of salvation. For after
that (by the means of the foresaid benefit) the holy ghost has entered into
the justified soul, he sits not there idle, it su^ficeth him not to grace
the soul with his presence, but with his virtue also he sanctifies the same,
working in her, and with her, whatsoever is convenient for her salvation.

He sits there like the Father of a family in his house, governing the
same: he sits there like a Master in a school, administering it: like a
gardner in his garden, trimming it: like a king in his kingdom ruling it: like
the Sun in the world, illuminating it: Finally, like the soul in the body,
giving him life, sense, and motion: not as the form in his matter, but as the
Father of his family in his household.

What therefore is more blessed, and more to be desired, then for a man to
have in himself such a guest, such a guide, such a companion, such a
governor, finally, such a tutor and helper? who being all in all, works
also all things in the soul in which it abides. But especially like fire he
illuminateth our understanding, inflameth our will, and exalts us from the
earth unto the heavens.

He like a Dove makes us simple, mild, peaceable, and friends to all men.
He like a clowd, cools us, and defends v^ from the burning lust of the
flesh, and tempereth the madness and fury of our passions. Finally* he like a
^^hement wind, moves and inclines our will to all goodness, se^ering the
same, and drawing it away from all evil inclinations: until (...) last the
justified attain that perfection, that all the vices are hateful unto them
which they first loved, and the virtues beloved which they (...) hated. As
David manifestly confesses the same to have chanced unto himself; For he
says in a certain place. Psalm. 116.
That he hated and abhorred iniquity: And in another place* That he^
delighted in the way of ^he ^estimonies of our Lord, Idem.
even as in all ^iches. The reason was, because the holy Ghost had ^^illed
into (...) soul, the wo^^wood of earthly things, and the honey of the divine
Commandments: in which thou see manifestly, that all our blessings are to
be ascribed to this holy Spirit; so that if we decline from evil, he is the
cause: and if we do good, we do it by his means; if we persevere in goodness,
by him we pe^seuer, and if reward be given for good, by him it is given.

Here also no small o^casion and matter i^ offered us, to discou^se of the
benefits of the Sacraments, (which are but as it were the instruments of our
justification) but especially of Baptism and the E^c^^rist. Ex lib. 1. de
^rat. et Medita^. tract. 7 cap. 4.
For (...) Baptism we are cleansed from original sin, delivered from the
power of the devil, and made the (...) of God, and (...) of his kingdom. In
Baptism (my brother) Christ espoused thy soul unto himself and dec^ed it
with i^wels and iem^ wo^thy so high an order, of which (...) are, grace,
virtue, the gift of the ^^ly Ghost, and others (...) ornaments: such as Isaac
(...) Rebecca, Gene. 34.
when he took her to wife. What therefore have thou do^^e that thou should
deserve to receive the least of these things? How many thousand (I say not of
men, but of nations) are excluded from these blessings by the just judgment of
God? What had become of thee, if thou had been borne amongst these nations?
if thou had not attained the true knowledge of god? but had adored blocks
and stones? How much art thou indebted to thy Lord God, that amidst so great
and infinite a number of reprobates, he would that thou should be reckoned
among the number of his elect? be borne amongst his chosed flock, be
nourished with the milk of the Apostles, and be made drunk with Christ's
blood? But if after the grace of this vocation* thou have lost thine innocence
of Baptism by thy recumbencie in sin, behold it pleased our Lord God to call
thee again the second, third, or more often times; What therefore shall thou
no^ owe unto him? How many benefits does this one comprehend? It was a benefit
that he ^ee gave then so long a time of repentance, that he suffered thee
lying so long sweltered in thy sins, merciful* bountiful, not cutting down
the fruitless tree which possessed the earth, and received the dew of divine
influence in vain*

It was another benefit, that suffering

Another is, that he instilled into

no more bound hand and foot, (...) and delivered from the (...) of the
devil.

Bu^ ^boue all the^e he^herto na^^d* grace, with what reward, with wh^^
offices, with what services, will thou recompense him? Of what mind will thou
be then, when thou shall hereafter, by the virtue of this vocation, enjoy
perpetual gladness in heaven with God, and see other thy companyons and
acquaintance, through defect of the same vocation and the like grace, cast into
eternal torments, and crucified in hell?

But of the grace of graces, and of that Sacrament of al Sacraments, by which
God would dwell amongst men, and give himself for daily food unto them and
remedy also, I can no ways hold my tongue. Once was there offered upon the
Cross a Sacrifice, and bloody host for our salvation; but in this Sacrament
he is daily applied unto us, for the remission of our sins. When soever you
do this (says he) do it in remembrance of me. O monument of salvation, o
singular Sacrament, o grateful mystery, bread of life; sweet nourishment;
royal banquet; having in thee Manna, the savor of all sweetness. Who may
enhaunce thee with answerable tytles? Who may worthily eat thee? who may honor
thee with due reverence, and according to thy merrits? My heart fails when I
think on thee; my tongue foultreth when I speak of thee; neither can I report
thy miracles according as I desire. If that bountiful Lord had bestowed this
benefit on only innocents, and those that are untouched and chaste of life, as
yet the gift had been inestimable: but now, what shall I say? when as to the
end he might impart himself unto them, he disdayneth not to pass by the
hands of many most ungodly Ministers, whose souls are the dwelling houses of
satan, and bodies, the vessels of corruption: whose life is consumed in vices
and the sudds of sin? Moreover, that he might visit his, and comfort his
friends, he has not refused to be handled with their de^^^ed and impure
hands, to be taken with their sacriligious mouth, and to be buried in their
filthy bellies. The ^ody of (...) was once sold, but in this Sacramen^, more
then a thousand ^imes, yea almost daily it is sold.

Once only in this world it wa^ mocked and contemned, but now incessantly by
these impure men it is contemned. Only once hung it between two thieves upon
the Cross but now in this Sacrament, he is daily crucified. How might we
woorthily honor this Lord? who by so many ways and means provided for our
salvation, what shall we render unto him for this so admirable a nourishment?

If Servant do their Masters service, because they are nourished by them;
if Soldiers press through sword and fire, that by this means they may
avoid the perrill of death, what ought we not to do for this Lord, that
gives us this celestial food? If God in the old Law, required so many
thanksgiuings for Manna, which he rayned from heaven for the Isralites, and
which was a corruptible meat, wh^^ will ^e require at our hands for this divine
food, which not only is i^corr^ptible in it self, but makes all those
incorrup^ible, that woorthily receive the same? If the son^e of God himself,
gave thanks unto his Father for a few Barley loves, as it appears in the
gospel, how great thanksgiving ought we men to yield him, for this
supernatural bread, this living bread, this divine bread? If we are bound to
give God thanks for the nutriment whereby our bodies are sustained, how much
owe we him for that our well-beeing is conserved? For we praise not a horse,
because he is a horse, but because he is good; nor the wine because it is
wine, but because it is good; neither a man because he is a man, but because he
is a good man.

If thou therefore in so many sorts art bound unto him who created thee a man,
how much more nearly art thou bound in love and duty unto him, because he
made thee a good man? If thou art tied unto him so much for the dowries of thy
body, how much owe thou for the gyfts of thy mind? if so much for the gyfts
of nature, how much for the gifts of grace? To conclude, if so many things are
due unto him, because he made thee the son of Adam, how much (I pray thee)
art thou a^nswerable unto him, tha^ from the son of unhappy Adam, has
con^erted thee into the so^^e of GOD? For better is the day in which we are
borne to eternity (a^ Eusebius Emisen^^ says,) then in which we are borne to
endure the perrils of this life. Behold brother, behold a new bond, behold a
new chain, by which, no less then by the precedent, thy heart is tied and
bound to desire virtue, and serve ^^y Lord God.

The Argument.
Notwithstanding the most grievous and diverse commination of the divine
justice, and the great rewards which are promised to those that are studious of
virtue, the greater part of men follows wickedness. The cause of this
mischief is, the general error of men, which persuades the^, that all the
rewards of virtue do appertain to the world to come: That virtue here i^
^^dious, difficult, and poor^: without having in this world ^yther reward or
sollace: whereas it has many worthy privileges, which the godly enjoy i^ this
world, but very many miseries and contrary calamities, wherewith the wicked
are exagitated.

CHAP. 13.
NOt without cause might a man ask this question, why amongst christians that
believe all these things, and confess y^ which hitherto has been spoken,
there are found so many who neglecting virtues, follow vices? that evil has
not one only root, but many and diverse. But amongst others, and they not the
least, is this; A certain general error in which the men of this world live,
believing that all that which God promises to the lovers of virtue; is
reserved for the future life, and that in this present world none of these are
to be exspected. For which cause, whereas man does highly affect reward, and
is chiefly drawn by profit, and is not moved but by things present; yea, and
such things as are object to the exterior senses: when he sees nothing
present, he sets light by that which is to come. So seems it that the
Jews did in the time of the Prophets. For when Ezechiell by the commandment
of God proposed unto them great promises, or denounced unto them dire
commina^ions, they hist, and after a contemptible sort disdained all things
saying; The vision that this man sees is of a long date, Ez^c^. 2.
and he prophecieth of times far hence. So likewise mockking the Prophet Esaias*
they contemned his words, Esaias, 28.
and said: Command, and recommaund* send, and send again; exspect, and
reexspect, exspect, and reexspect a little there* a little there. This is one
of the chiefest reasons which calls perverse men from the observance of the
commandments of God, persuading themselves that in this world there is no
reward prefixed for virtue; but that all things are reserved for the world to
come. This considered that great wise man, when he said; ^ccles. 8.
Truly because the sentence is not speedily pronounced against the wicked,
without any fear the ^onns of men perpetrate wickedness. And another wise man
adds* That amongst all things that are done under the sun, the worst is,
and that which gives greatest occasion to the wicked of committing sin, that
evils fall upon the just, as if ^hey had done the works of the wicked; and the
wicked sometimes live so ^ec^^ely, as if they had done the deeds of the just,
or because all things are equal to the just, and the impious; the good, and
the evil; the clean, and the unclean; to him that offers sacrifice, and
him that con^emneth it; As the good man* so also the sinner; as the perlu^ed*
so likewise he^ that speaks truth. Where-(...) he says. And the hearts of the
son^^ of men are filled with malice and contempt in their life, and hereafter
they shall lead unto hell.

But that which Solomon here speaks, the evil and wicked themselves
confess in the Prophecy of Malachy, saying* Vain is he that serves God,
Mala. 3.
and what has it profited, that we have kept his precepts, and that we have
walked circumspectly before the Lord of hosts* We therefore call the arrogant
blessed, because they are builded up doing impiety, tempting God, and yet are
saved. These things say the wicked, and these are they that ^hie^^ly de^ayne
them in their impiety. For, (as S. Ambrose says) they think it to be a hard
matter, to buy they^ hope by their perrill* that is, to obtain the future
blessings, by the hazard of the present, and to give that which is in their
possession, for such things as seem as yet to be very far from them.

To root out that pestilent error* I know not truly from whence ^ beginning
may be more commodiously taken, then from those wo^^^ and tears of our Savior,
with which ^e in times past bewept that miserable City of Jerusalem, saying:
For if thou also had known, Luke. 19.
and that ^ruly in this thy day, those things that belong to thy peace, but
now are they hidden from thine eyes, Christ knew on the one side, that with
himself, all the graces and celestial treasures descended upon those of
Jerusalem, and on the other side, he saw the blind and miserable people,
ignorant thereof, and vnwil^ing to know it; and therefore that ^n utter
overthrow attended them. For this cause deploreth he them. The like cause have
we to bewail the lovers of this world, whilst here we see the pulchritude of
virtue, and the wonderful graces and great ^iches that attend thereon. There,
^owe far these things are remoo^ed and hidden from the eyes of men, drowned
in earthly thoughts, ^s also in what sort virtue changes ^er place; and
dispersed through the ^hole world, finds no place se^^rely to dwell in.

O if God would open the eyes of ^hese men, that they might see the ^reasures*
riches* peace, liberty* light, tranquillity, delights, favors, and goods,
which follow virtue even as slaves even in this life, how much would they
esteem her? with how great desire would they aspire thereunto? with how great
study, with how many labou^s would they seek her? But now all these things
are hidden from their eyes, and they behold nothing but the external semblance
of virtue, not tasting the interior sweetness thereof, and therefore think they
that there is nothing in the same that is not hard, difficult, ane unsavory:
deeming this mon^ current, not in this present, but the future life: yet if
there be any good therein* thy suppose the same to appertain to another world,
not unto this.

But thou whatsoever thou art th^^ so think, why considerest th^^ not the
assistance that GOD ha^^ prepared for us to overcome th^^ difficulty, of which
sort are the virtues infused, the gifts of the (...) Ghost, the Sacraments of
the ne^^ law, with many other graces and ^^uine helps, which are unto us as
(...) Oars and sails to the ship, and wings to the birds. Thou oughtst to
have remembered that God not only promised his, the goods of glory, but also of
grace: those for the future life, this for the present: according to that of
the Prophet; Our Lord will give grace and glory, which are like two cofers
furnished with all blessings, the one for this life, the other for the future.
If the wo^ld and the devil for the services which their followers do unto
them, bestow so many kinds of favors, pleasures, and delights, at leastwise
in appearance: How is it possible that God should be so niggard to his friends
and faithful ministers, that he should leave them hungry and thirsty in the
midst of their labors and tribulations? Hear what God answers to the
lamentations of the wicked by the mouth of his Prophet. Convert and see what
there is betwixt the just and unjust, Mal. 3.
and between him that ser^eth God* and him that serves him not: So that God
is not contented with the prerogative which the just shall have over the unjust
in the future life, but in the present (he says,) Convert, and see: as if he
said. I wi^^ not that you should exspect the future world, that you might know
the glory of the good, and the excellency of blessedness: But turn now, and
see also in this life, the difference which is between good and evil: the
riches of the one, and the poverty of the other: the joy of the one, and the
sadness of the other: the peace of the one, and the wa^re of the other: the
light in which the one lives, and the darkness in which the other walks;
and the^ truly shall you know, that the condition of the just, is more blessed
then you suppose.

But if the way of virtue seems barren and horrid to thee, what is i^ that
the divine wisdom says of of her self: With me are ri^cher and glory,
great wealth and justice: I will walk in the ways of justice, in the midst of
the paths of judgment, that I may enritch those that love me, and that I may
fill the^^ treasures. What riches, what good^ are they? except of his
heauenl^^ wisdom, which exceed all the ^^^ches of this world: which are
^^stowed on them, who walk in (...) ways of justice, which is the (...)
virtue whereof we now speak. (...) if here there be not found rit^^es more
excellent and wealthy, (...) those which the world pro^^^seth; why did the
Apostle give ^od thanks for the Corinthians, (...): That in all things they
were (...) rich, 1, Corin. ^.
terming them absolut^^ rich, signifying that others are (...) to be called
rich, but the rich this world.

Out of the first book, chap. 11. the Guide of a sinner.

The Argument.
^^at that common error of men, of which mention was made in the precedent
chapter, may be taken away; and that it may be also proved, that virtue has
her rewards in this world: there are twelve ^riuiledges rehearsed, which the
virtuous enjoy in this world, and as many contrary evils which follow the
wicked. Of these the six first ^re expressed in this chapter, name^y; The
singular providence of God toward the just: The grace of * holy spirit; ^^ght
and supernat^r^^ knowledge: the consolations of (...) holy Ghost* The peace of
conscien^^^ and hope of Go^s mercy.

CHAP. 14.
How foulely do they (...) that think there is no ^^^warde proposed for
(...) in this life, it appears the chapter going befo^^^ To confound
therefore that (...) so perilous, besides those things (...) are already
spoken: these two privileges which follow sha^^ very profitable, in which we
(...) entreat of the twelve admira^ fruits, which accompany (...) this life,
that by them the loue^ this world may know, that (...) are far more
excellent benef^^^ to be found in ^ertue, then (...) suppose.

The first and principal of t^^ ^ere be in him a general proui^ence of all
creatures, yet has he (...) a singular care of those, whom (...) himself
has chosen for his ^^ne: holding them in the place (...) his own children,
giving them a (...) a filial mind likewise, and he ^ like sort bearing
toward them ^e heart of a most loving father, and ^^refore has he a care and
proui^ence aunswerable to this love. No (...) observes his friends with like
(...) and diligence, as God does his, ^ho are always conversant in his (...),
and to whom he is assistant in (...) their tribulations. David confes^^th this
in his Psalms, when he ^^th; Psalm. 40.
But me have thou favored ^r my innocence sake, and thou (...) confirmed me
always in thy ^^ght, that is: Thou have never tur^ed thine eyes from me, for
the ^ontinuall care which thou have of ^^e. And in another place: The eyes ^f
our Lord are upon the just, and ^is ears are opened unto their prai^^s. And:
Many are the tribulations ^f the just, and our Lord shall deli^er them out of
all their troubles. Our Lord keeps all their bones, Psalm. 33.
so that none of them shall be rem^^ued. In the new Testament he (...) that he
has not only care of the^^ bones, but of every one of the^^ hairs. If that
seem much (...) thee, hear no less then that (...) he said by his Prophet:
Zach 2,
He (...) touches you, touches no (...) then the apple of mine eye. Psalm.
90, and 33.
Neith^^ content that he only has care (...) us, but has commanded
likew^^^ his Angels to guide us, that they (...) direct us in all our ways.
For (...) care GOD is called in holy Scr^^^tures, a Father, rather then a
M^^ther; a Pastor, and a Spouse. (...) providence yields a great (...) of
rejoice to the righteous, as it a^^peareth by many places of the Scr^^^ture.

Contrariwise, the wicked live (...) neglected and forsaken by God, (...) are
in this world, like a patrimo^^ without an heir, like a (...) without a
Master, like a ship (...) out a Pilot, like a flock without Shepherd,
exposed to the (...) throat of the Woolfe. (...) this manner God threatens
(...) by the mouth of the prophet, (...) I will not feed you: that that dies,
let it die; and that which is cut off, Zach. 11.
let it be cut off: and let the rest devour every one of them the flesh of his
neighbor. But this is most dangerous; For whereas the world is a stormy Sea,
and as it were a De^art full of thieues, and horrible beasts, whereas there are
so many incommodities and misfortunes of man's life, whereas our enemies with
who^ we are to fight, are so many and so strong, when as there are so many
hidden snares, so many traps laid, to conclude, so many and so great
difficulties every ways scattered and sowed in our ways: and a man is a
creature so frail, naked blind, unarmed, fearful, and void of counsel; ^f
the shadow and assistance of God fail, what can he poor weak one do amongst
so many strong? a Dwarf amidst so many Giants? blind amidst so many snares?
a^one, and unweaponed, amongst ^o many Armed and strong enemies?

God permits also that such should fall from one sin into another, he
suffers them according to the desires of their own hearts, that the causes of
their damnation may be multiplied. Neither is this the end of his evil: Psalm.
8.
For it suffices not God, that he auerteth his eyes from the unjust and
sinful: and that he permits them to fall into diverse errors and sorts of
tribulation; but he also sends them and armeth creatures against them: so
that those eyes that were first opened for their profit, now watch for their
perdition, as God says by the Prophet; I will fix mine eyes upon them in
evil, Amos. 9.
and not in good: Neither is there place wherein a man may hide himself from
these eyes, as God testifies at large in the same chapter. And how perilous it
is to have God incensed against us, many examples do teach us.

To this providence it appertains of the holy spirit, next after that
providence, the beginning of all other privileges, and celestial gifts. Now
this grace is the participation of the divine nature, that is, of goodness,
purity, and nobility of God himself, by whose help and means, a man casts
away from himself all vileness, abiectnes, and inciuilitie, which he received
from Adam; and is made pertaker of the divine nobility, putting off himself,
and putting on Jesus Christ. Grace is the spiritual ornament of the soul,
made by the hands of the holy Ghost, which makes the soul so fair and
gracious in Gods eyes, that he receaueth the same for his daughter and his
spouse. Of this ornament Esaias boasts; Esaias, 6.
Rejoicing (says he) I will rejoice in our Lord, etc. The principal effect of
grace, is to make the soul so grateful and fair in Gods eyes, that he
chooses the same for his daughter, his spouse his temple, his house, in which
he delights himself with the sons of men. Another effect thereof is, not
only to adorn the soul, but also to strengthen it, by the means of those
virtues which proceed from the same, which are like Sampsons hairs, in which
con^isted not only his beauty, but his strength. Grace therefore armeth the
whole man, and makes him so strong (as S. Thomas says;) That the least grace
is sufficient to bind and overcome all devils, and all sins. It makes also
all actions, yea, even those that are indifferent grateful unto God. It makes
us the sons of God by adoption, and heirs of the celestial Kingdom, worthy
also to be registered in the book of life. And to speak many things in a few
words, Grace is that which makes a man apt to all goodness, that smootheth the
way to heaven, that lightneth and makes our Lords yoke easy unto us, that
heals our infirm nature; enfl^meth our will, comfort our memory,
strengthens our wit, moderateth the sensu^l part, least it ouer-flow with
offenses: confirms the irefull, least it be slack and sluggish to do well.
Finally, it makes God dwell in our souls, that dwelling in the same he might
govern, defend, and direct the same toward heaven. God therefore ^itteth in
our souls like a King in his Kingdom, a General in his Army, a Master in his
School, and a Shepherd in his Flock, that he may there exercise, and
execute all spiritual offices* and all providence. Go too therefore, if this
so goodly a Margarite, from which so many benefits do flow, be a perpetual
companion of virtue, who would not willingly imitate that prudent Merchaunt in
the Gospel, who sold all that he had, that he might get this one and
only treasure? This grace do they all want, that are entangled, and persevere
in sin.

The third privilege, is a certain special light, and supernatural have
power to do that which he now knows needful to be done. Therefore the
Prophet sai^e; Psalm. ^6.
Our Lord is m^ ^ightning against igno^ance* and my ^a^uation against my
weakness. To this ^riuiledge appertain the four gifts of the holy Spirit* as
are the gift of wisdom, which is given for the knowledge of divine things.
The gift of science, which is given that we may understand inferior things:
The gift of understanding, by which we attain the knowledge of the mysteries
of God: And the gift of coun^aile* by means whereof we conceive the actions
of this life, and in them how to govern what so ever shall encounter us. But
this knowledge is not so much speculatiue, as active: not so much
contemplative, as practiue, neither is it given us that we should understand,
but that we should work, not that we should be subtle and ingenious in
disputing, but that we should be studious in enduring. And therefore it
remains not only in the understanding, a^ Sciences, which are acquired in
Schools, but by the virtue thereof it moves the will, enclining the same to
follow virtue. Of this Science Christ speaks in the Gospel: John. 14.
The holy Ghost which my Father sends in my name, John. 6.
he shall teach you in all truth; and it is written in the Prophets: They shall
be all taught of God. They that partake this celestial gift, are not puffed
up with vain glory in prosperity, nor amated in adversity. For by the benefit
of this light they see, of how small moment it is which the world can give, or
take away, if it be compared with those things which are in Gods power. The
wiseman testifies this, when he says: A man settled in his wisdom, Eccles.
27.
abides as the Sun: The fool is changed like the Moon.

This is that wisdom which the children of light enjoy: but on the contrary
side, the wicked live in those horrible darks of Egypt, which may be felt with
the hands. Of which thing the figure was; where it is said; That in the land
of Goshen, where the children of Israel dwelt, there was light, and in Egypt
for three days space so thick darkness, that it might be felt, which
represented that obscure night in which ^inners live, as they themselves
confess in Esaias, Esaias, 5.
saying: We have exspected the light, and behold darkness* the clear day, and
behold we have walked in obscurity: We have felt for the wall like blind men,
and as it were without eyes we have groped about* we have stumbled at
noone-dayes, as it were in darkness, and in misty* as it were the dead. For what
greater blindness can it be then to sell the right of first birth; that is, the
heritage of the celestial Kingdom, for a little pleasure of this world, then
not to fear hell? not to aspire to heaven? not to hate sin? not to remember
the latter judgment? to set light by the promises and threatenings of our Lord?
not to remember death which every moment is imminent? not to prepare himself
to yield an account? not to think that it is a momentarie thing which
delights, and an eternal, which does excruciate? They knew not (says the
Prophet) neither understand, Psa. 8.
they walk (...) darkness, and from darkness into darkness shall they go.

The fourth privilege is the joy of the holy Ghost: Of that knowledge Psalm. 96.
Many confess that as in vices there are all kinds of evil, so in virtues
there are al sorts of goodness, only pleasure excepted, which diverse deny to be
in the same. And whereas the heart of man desires nothing more then pleasures,
men had rather have imperfect pleasure; then that which wants pleasure, with
all the perfections thereof. But o unhappy man, if virtue have not joy and
delight in her, what is that which David says; How great a multitude of thy
sweetness haft thou hoorded up for those that fear thee? Psalm. 30.


In which words the Prophet* not only expresses the greatness of the sweetness
which is reserved for the godly, but also gives a reason, why the wicked do
not know the same: namely, because our lord hides the same from their eyes.
This sweet^nes the godly especially partake in their prayers; Neither is this
joy only peculier to them that are perfect, but the younger soldiers also of
Christ, and such as are newly entered into his service, have their sweetness, and
find their joys in the way of our Lord, as that sollemne day testifies,
Luke. 15.
appointed by the Father for his prodigal son.

The wicked are not pertakers of this joy, for even as he that has his palate
corrupted with evil humors, tastes not the sweetness of the meat, (for that
which is bitter he deemeth sweet, and that which is sweet, bitter,) So they
that have their soul corrupted with ^uill and disordered humors, of vices and
affections, and so accustomed to the fleshpots of Egypt, have no feeling of
the sweetness of virtue, but think vice sweet, and virtue bitter.

The fifth privilege is the peace of August. de Catichizand. arudit.
amidst the most bitter molestations of this life, if thou love his precepts
that promised the same unto thee. For thou shall quickly perceive, that ye
fruits of justice, are sweeter then those of iniquity; and thou shall more
truly and contentedly enjoy the goods of the conscience, amidst troubles, then
of the evil, amongst delights. Hitherto S. Augustine.

And truly, even as honny, is not only sweet of it self, but also sweetneth
that which was before bi^^er: so a good conscience is so iocond and merry: that
it makes all the troubles and tribulations of this world seem delightful.
So great is the fruit and sweetness of a good conscience; as S. Ambrose in his
book of O^fices, is not afraid to say, that the beatitude of the just in this
life, consists in the same. His words are these. The brightness of honesty is
so great, Ambros. lib. 2, Offici. lib. 2, Tus^ul. quest.
that peace of conscience, and security of innocence, do make a blessed life.
The same understood the Ethniques, amongst whom Cicero says thus: A life led
in honesty and vprightnes, brings so much consolation, that sickness either
touches not, or grief of mind lightly attayneth those, who have so lived.
Bias demanded; what in this life wanted fear; answered: A good conscience.
And Seneca in a certain Epistle, says, It is never without joy, and that
proceeds from a good conscience. By which it appears how fitly the
Philosophers sentence accords with that of Solomon: Proverb. 15.
All the days of the poor are evil, that is miserable; a secure mind is
like a perpetual banquet. Contrariwise, the wicked live in perpetual fear
and suspicion. For even as the conscience is the Master of the godly, so is it
the torture and heads man of the wicked, which afflicts and inwardly
tormenteth, and without intermission accuses sinners of their wickedness
committed, and mixeth wormwood amongst all their delights. For the turpitude
of sin, injuries done unto other men, infamy, incertayntie of life, fear of
death, dread to yield account, and horror of hell, like thorns do tear the
har^ of a sinner, that when he is alone he can never take comfort. So that it
is well said by Isodore. Lib. 2, Soliloq.
The guilty soul is never secure; For an evil mind is always afflicted with
the stings of his own conscience, then which punishment what is more grievous?
Here-vpon S. Ambrose: What more grievous punishment the^ wound of the inward
conscience? Ambros. in Offici.
Is not this more to be esteemed then death? then loss? then banishment? then
weakness? then grief is? which is so unfeignedly true, Seneca Epi. 43 et lib.
de moribus. Cicero orati. pro Milone.
that the Ethniques also had knowledge thereof, as many the worthy writings of
Seneca, Cicero, and others do testify.

The sixth privilege is, the confidence and hope of virtue, in which Psalm. 118.
Remember (o Lord) thy promises, in which thou gave me hope; this comforted
me in my humility. The effects of this hope are many and excellent. For it
strengthens a man in the way of virtue, by the hope of reward, or
recompense; For the more sure he is of the pledge of this reward, the more
willingly he runs through what soever tribulations of this world, as with
one voice all the Fathers do confess. Every work (says Saint Ierosme) is
wont to become light, when as the recompense thereof is thought upon, and the
hope of the reward becomes the solace of the labor.

The obtaining thereof does not in the end only strengthen us, but it helps
also in the midst thereof, yea in all necessity and worldly misery. By this a
man is succored in all tribulation, defended in perils, by th^s he receaueth
comfort in his calamities, help in his infirmities, sufficient in all his
necessities. By this we obtain the grace and mercy of our Lord, which
assisteth us in every thing. Of this there are diverse testimonies in
Scriptures, especially in the Psalms. Psalm. 9, 30.39. Esaias, 30. Eccles. 2.
Proverb. 3.
Hope is as it were a secure Haven, to which the just do direct their course,
when-so-euer any tempest of this world does assail them; and like a strong
shield wherein all our enemies darts are received without any wound. It is as
it were a gadge, or prouant hidden, to which in time of famine all the poor
man repair, and take bread. It is that Tabernacle and that shaddowe which our
Lord promises by Esaias, that it should be to his elect a shelter in the heat
of the day, and a covert from the storm and rain, that is, from all adversity
and prosperity of this world. F^nally, it is a medicine and common remedy for
all our evils. For it is most certain, that what soever we justly, faithfully,
and prudently hope from God, we shall receive the same, so that it be necessary
for our salvation and pertain thereunto. Therefore Cyprian caleth the mercy of
GOD an inexhaunst fountain of goodness, Cypr. ad Donat. Epist. 2, lib. 2.
and hope, or a vessel of confidence, wherein those benefits are contained;
and he says, that according to the quantity of the vessel, the proportion of
the remedy shall be likewise correspondent. For in regard of the fountain,
the water of mercy shall never fail. Every place says our Lord to the
children of Israel, which the step of your foot shall tread upon, I will give
you. So all the mercy upon which a man shall settle his foot, shall be his.

The wicked also have a certain hope, yet not a living but a dead hope, for
sin takes away the life thereof, and therefore their hope works not in
them, the effects which we have above rehearsed. Of this hope it is written;
The hope of the wicked is like the down that is tossed up, and like the light
foame which is scattered by the storm, and like the ^moake which is dispersed
by the wind. By which you may perceive how vain the hope of the wicked is.
And not only is this hope vain, but hurtful, deceitful, and dangerous also,
as GOD warns by the Prophet, Woe unto you, you sons forsakers; that is, you
that have forsaken your Father, (says our Lord) that you might do counsel,
but not of me, etc. hoping for help in the strength of Pharao, and having
trust in the shadow of Egypt. And Pharaos strength shall be confusion unto you,
and that which follows: And in the chapter which follows, Woe to you that
descend into Egypt for help, hoping in your horses. etc. You see here, that
the hope of the wicked, is flesh, of the good, spirit; the one of them to be
naught else then man, the other to be God: So that what difference there is
between god and man, the same is there found between hope and hope. What
difference there is between both the hopes, the Prophet Jeremy aptly
describes, Chapter 17. Cursed (says he) is the man, that trusts in man,
etc: And after he has expounded this malediction, he opposes the blessing of
the righteous. Blessed (says he) is the man that trusts in our Lord etc.

Of these six fore-sayde Privileges, and their contraries has he entreated,
lib 1, part, 2 of the Guide of a sinner, Chapters 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

The Argument.
The riches of virtue are not circumscribed within these privileges only, but
they have also other six annexed unto them, no less valuable the^ the former,
as are. That it makes the man in whom it abides, possessor of the true
liberty of the Spirit, and free from all perturb^tions. That it fills the
heart with incredible peace. That God hears the prayers of good men: That the
divine assistance, is always near them in all their tribulations. That all
good things are bestowed on the godly, which are any ways necessary in this
life: That the death of the righteous, is pleasant, blessed, and peaceable: to
which goods so many evils are opposed, which make the life of dissolute men,
miser^ble and unhappy.

CHAP. 15.
THe seventh privilege of Virtue is, the true liberty of the mind, of which
the Apostle speaks: Where the Spirit of our Lord is, there is liberty. This
liberty our Lord promised the Jews, when he said; If you shall continue in my
sayings, John. 8.
you shall truly be my disciples, and you shall know the truth, and the truth
shall deliver you, that is, shall give you true liberty. They answered him; We
are the seed of Abraham, and we have not as yet served any man, how say thou
then, ye shall be free? Jesus answered and said unto them; Verily, verily, I
say unto you; Every one that does sin, is the slave of sin, now the servant
remains not in the house for ever, but the son remains for ever. If
therefore the Son has delivered you, you shall be truly free.

In which words there is a double liberty insinuated, a false, and a true. The
false is theyrs who have their body free, but their soul captive, and subject
to the tyranny of their own passions and sins, such as was that of Alexander
the great, who being King of the whole world, was a slave to his own
appetites and vices.

The true, is of those which have their minds void of all those tyrants,
although they have their body sometimes free, sometimes thrale and captive.
Such as was that of the Apostle Saint Paul; who although he were captive, and
held in bonds, yet in spirit he flew through the heavens, and by the doctrine of
his Epistles, se^ at liberty the whole world. This true liberty is of those
that follow virtue; but the false is of those that lie drowned in vice and sin.

Of this liberty of the good, and thraldom of the wicked, there is a most
excellent and copious treatise, in the first book of the Guide of a sinner,
part 2. chap. 19. to which place we refer the Reader.

The eight privilege, is the peace Psalm. 119.
of which David speaks, when he says; I was peaceable with those that hated
peace, when I spoke unto them, they im^ugned me without a cause. Another peace
is with GOD, of which the Apostle says; Being justified therefore by faith,
let us have peace with GOD. Rom, 5.
The third is, that which a man has with himself.

Now, that I say thus, let no man admire, for it appears, that in one and
the same man, there are founde^ two men, and they contrary the one against the
other; as are the interior and exterior; or the spirit and flesh; the appetite
and reason. Which contrariety, not only combatteth the mind with cruel
assaults, but troubles the whole man also with his passions, ardent desires
and raging hunger. The godly therefore having grace the governor of a^^ their
senses and appetites, and all their will resigned into the hands of god, are not
by any encounter so perturbed, as that they loose their interior peace. This
peace is promised by our Lord, to the lovers of virtue, by the kingly prophet,
when he says; Great is the peace of those that love thy law, Psalm. 118.
and no blame or scandale may befall the^. And in Esaias, would to God thou had
kept my commandments, Esaias. 4.
thy peace had been like a river, and their justice, like the waves of the sea.
But what peace this is, may rather be understood by the practice then
speculation; For the just man knows, how much his heart differs now when he
serves God, from that which he bare about him, when he was co^uersant in the
world: For then, in all perrill of tribulation he was suddenly afraid, he
trembled, in heart and body he feared: But after he left the world, and
translated his heart to the love of celestial things, and planted all his hope
in God, he ouer-passeth all things what soever chance, with a quiet heart
subjected to Gods will. All the perturbations of his mind, as if dead, are at
rest, neither is he provoked by any affections: The inferior part of the
mind, is obedient, the superior governs, and that in great peace and exelent
order.

But the wicked and sinners, are always in war, contention, and
perturbation: for while on the one side they are deprived of grace, which is as
it were a bytte restrayning their passions and mortifying them; and on the
other side, so unbridled and disordered by their appetites, and dissolute
affections, as they scarce know what it is to resi^t any vice. They live in
infinite de^ires of diverse things: Some of honors, some of dignities, some of
riches, some of marriage; and other likewise are moved with other pleasures
and concupisences. For the appetite is as it were a fire, which never cries
enough, or as a devouring beast, that is never satisfied, and as it were a
horseleach, Prou. 30.
which has two young ones, saying; Bring, bring.

This blood-sucker, is the insatiable appetite of our heart, whose two daughters
are Necessity and Cupiditie, whereof the one is as it ^ere a true thirst, the
other as it were a false; neither does the one afflict less the the other,
although the one be true necessity, the other false Hence it is, yt neither
rich nor pore, (if they be wicked) have any true peace or quiet, for these
men's hearts are solicited by desire, the other, with continual necessity,
saying; Bring, bring. What peace therefore can a man have, being solicited by
these two, and importuned for in^inite th^nges, which are not in his power?
What quiet can the mother have, which has round about her many hungry
children, crying through need, and asking bread, and ^hee not having
wherewith to satisfy them?

The ninth privilege of virtue is, because God hears the prayers of

This one thing did so much afflict those wise men in time past with so much
tediousnes, that among them there is one to be found, that was not afraid to
say, that he doubted whether Nature were our mother, or rather our step-dame,
which has subjected us to so many miseries. Which being so, what remedy (I
pray you) has he left, who punished mankind so grievously? Tell me, what
remedy has a man, weak and lame, that sailing by sea, with one misfortune
loses al his riches? I know what thou will say; if thou say he has not
whereupon to live, neither that by reason of infirmity he can labor for his
living, it must needs be that he must beg: neither has a man other remedy
left him, then like a poor beggar to cry at the gate of our Lord. But thou will perchance ask me, whether this remedy be universal, for every necessity
of our life? To this (since it wholly depends on gods will) I can answer
naught else, but that God chose unto himself, to this end, witnesses and
secretaries, such as are the Apostles and Prophets, amongst whom one says;
There is not another so great a Nation, Deuteronomy. 4.
that have their gods so favorable to them, as our Lord God is assistant to
all our obsecrations. When therefore we do pray, although we see no man that
answers us, yet speak we not unto the walls, but god himself is present with
us, who hears and helps us when we pray, having compassion of our
necessities, and preparing the remedy. What therefore more greater comfort may
it be to him that prays, then to have assurance of so certain a presence. And
if this be sufficient to comfort the^ that pray, how much shall those things
confirm them, which Christ himself speaks, saying; Ask and you shall have,
Math, 9,
seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you. What more
precious and certain figne may we have the^ that is? who will call these words
into question? who will not be refreshed with this sollace in all his prayers?
whom will not so royal letters patent satisfy?

Contrariwise, of the prayers of the wicked it is said. When you shall lift up
your hands, Esaias. 18,
I will turn mine eyes from you, and when you shall multiply your prayers, I
will not hear you. Job. 27.
And in the book of Job, For what hope has the hypocrite, if he greedily take
other men's goods, if God deliver not his soul? Shall god hear his cry, when
trouble shall fall upon him? A thousand and more of such like authorities, might
be collected from the sacred Scriptures, by which may be gathered, that the
godly are handled and heard like children, but the ungodly reuerted like
enemies.

The tenth privilege of virtue is, their Father, and that it is he that
enioyneth them to taste this cup, like a certain medicine prescribed by a
most expert and cunning Physician. And that tribulation is as it were a
refining or polishing, which the more sharper it is, so much the more pure and
brighter does it make the soul, and clen^eth away all corruption: and
therefore they cast down their heads, and are humbled like young children in
the time of tribulation.

But if at any time the labor increase, the help of the divine grace, is
presently at hand, that never forsakes the just in time of tribulation. For
GOD himself (as his holy word witnesses) is never more near the faithful,
then in the time of their tribulation, although it seems quite contrary.

Read and ouer-reade the sacred Scriptures, and thou shall find that there is
scarcely any thing that is so often repeated and promised in them, as that
which we hear speak of. Is it not writt^n of GOD, that he is our helper in
necessities, and tribulations? Is it not he that inuiteth us, that in time of
tribulation we should call upon him? Call upon me (says he) in the time
of tribulation, Psalm. 49.
and I will deliver thee, and thou shall honor me.

Does not the prophet (having experience hereof,) testify the same? When I
did invoke (says he) the Lord of my justice heard me, Psalm. 4.
in tribulation thou have comforted me. Hence it is that we read, that the
Saints being very often circumuented with many perils, and temptations,
remained immoouable, and unconstant in mind, and of a pleasant and merry look
and gesture: for they knew they had present with them, that faithful custody
which never had forsaken them: which is even then most of all present, when
dangers are grown to their uttermost.

Of this those three holy young men had a feeling, when king Nabuchodonozer
commanded them to be cast into the burning furnace in Babylon. To this is
annexed, the help and favor of all virtues, which at that time concur,
toward the strengthening of the afflicted mind. For even as when the heart is
vexed, all the blood from every part in the body, has recourse thereunto, to
succor it least it fail; So when the soul is ouer-pressed with grief and
anguish, all the virtues do presently concur, and help, her now this way,
straight another way: Faith is at hand, bringing with her a clear knowledge of
the good and evil that follows after this life: Hope likewise comes, which
makes a man patient in tribulation, in expectation of reward. Charity draws
nie, with the love whereof a man being inflamed, he desires to suffer all
kinds of affliction. Obedience, and the conformity of our will with Gods will,
approach, from whose hands a man receaueth with gladness, and without grudging,
whatsoever is given. These, and other such like, are the cause that the godly
in their tribulations, are patient, and magnanimious: Yea, that willingly they
seek out affliction; saying with S. Bernard, Give me (o Lord) tribulation,
that thou may be always with me.

Contrariwise, the wicked in that they have neither charity, nor fortitude, nor
hope, because tribulations find them unarmed and unprepared, and for that they
want the light* by means whereof they may see that which the godly behold by
a lively faith: neither by experience have proved that wonderful goodness, and
fatherly providence of God wherewith he respects his servants, when
tribulations are at hand: They are cruel to themselves and inhumane, they
neglect the glory of our Lord, blaspheme his name, scandale his providence,
detrac^ from his justice, curse his mercy, and open their sacrilidgious mouths
against heaven, and his Majesty, Hence it falls out, that calamities at last
do reign into their houses, and their miseries are doubled, which God
inflicteth upon them for their so many blasphemies. For this reward does he
deserve that spetteth in Gods face, and will kick against the prick.

benefits for the sustentation of their life, which is approved by that of
Solomon. The length of days is in his right hand, that is, Pro. 3.
his ^ertue; and in his left hand, riches and glory. So that virtue has two
kinds of good to inuit a man* on the right hand, eternal; on the left,
temporal. Do not think that God leaves his servant so, as they die for
hunger; neither that he is so improuident, and negligent, that whereas he
gives food in due season to Ants and Worms, he will leave men, that day and
night serve in his house, consumed with hunger, and made lean with want. By
this reward the Psalmist does inu^te us to virtue, saying: Fear our Lord,
all ye his Saints, because there is no necessity that can happen to those
that fear him: The rich have wanted and have been hungry, Psalm. 33.
but they that seek after our Lord, shall want no good thing. If thou seek
more testimonies, read the sixth of Matthew, and the eight and twentieth of
Deuteronony. But if perhaps any one shall say that those promises in
Deuteronomy, are rather made to the Jews then the Christians, (for to these
are greater the^ temporal promises made, namely the goods of grace and glory,)
let him know, that even as God in that Heb. 7.16.
carnal law, denied not the Jews that were just, spiritual things; so
neither in the spiritual law, will he withold temporal blessings from those
that are good Christians. For this is the law of the covenant and promise which
God made twixt man and himself, that man should observe his commandments,
and GOD likewise should procure for him, those things that were necessary, and
take care of him: neither will God ever violate this covenant. For if man be
a faithful servant unto God, GOD also will be a faithful Lord and patron
unto man. This is that one thing that God said was necessary; Luke. 10.
namely, to know, to love, and to serve God: for this one thing being
observed, the rest are in safety. Piety (says S. Paul) is profitable to all
things, Tim. 4.
having the promises of life present and to come. See (I pray you) how
manifestly Paul here promises to Piety, not only the goods of eternal
life, but temporal also.

But if any man will know how great the adversity and poverty of the ungodly
is, let him read the 28* chapter of Deutronomy, and he shall there find those
things which shall both breed admiration in him, and strike fear into his
heart: Neither are these comminations vain, or invented to terrify men: but
are rather true prophecies, whose truth very often the after event has
approved. The siege of Samaria under King Achab, the destruction of the City
of Jerusalem under Titus, do both testify, that nothing in that chapter of
Deutronomy is spoken in vain. Neither let any man think that these things
are only spoken to the Jews: for they pertayne unto all men that have the
knowledge of Gods law, and those likewise that transgress the same, as GOD
testifies by the Prophet. Have I not (says he) caused the people of Israel to
ascend from the Land of Egypt, and the Palestines from Capadocia, the Sirians
from Cirene? Behold, the eyes of our Lord are upon the Kingdom, which is full
of wickedness, and I will grind them from the face of the earth. The diverse
slaughters and ruins of Kingdoms and Empires inferred in times past in the
Christian world, Amos, 7.
by the Hunes, Goths, and Vandales, testify no less.

Psalm. 115.
in the sight of our Lord. And Ecclesiasticus: Ecclesiast. 1.
In extremity all things shall be well to those that fear God, and in the day
of his death he shall be blessed.

What greater hope and confidence may be wished for, then that of blessed
Saint Martine? Who upon the instant of death, espying the enemy of mankind:
Cruel beast (says he) why stand thou nigh me: Cruel as thou art, thou
shall find nothing in me, for the bosom of Abraham shall receive me in peace.
So the just fear not death, nay, rather they rejoice in their departure,
praise God, and in as much as in them lies, give him thanks for their end: for
by the benefit of death they are delivered from all their labors; and begin to
taste the first fruits of their felicity.

Of these (says Saint Augustine: In Epistola Iohann^s.
) He that desires to be dissolved, and to be with Christ, dies not
patiently, but lives patiently, and dies delightfully. The just man therefore
has no cause to lament, or fear death, nay rather, it is to be said of him,
that lik^ the Swanne, he dies singing, gyuing glory to GOD that callet^ him.

But the death of sinners is most wretched (says the Prophet) for it is evil
in the loosing of the world, Psalm. 115.
worse in the separation from the flesh, and woorst of all, in the double
contrition of the woorme and fire (lays Saint Bernard.) This is the last and
not the least evil, as well of the boddie as of the soul. For it is hard to
leave the world, harder to forsake the body, hardest to be tormented in hell
fire. These, and other such like infinite evils do torment sinners in the
hour of their death, which make their end, troublesome, disquiet, ^euere, and
cruel.

Of all these things the Author entreats very largely, lib. 1, Guide of a
sinner, chap. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, truly most worthy the reading and observation.

The conclusion of all those things which hitherto have been spoken of the
privileges of virtues.

CHAP. 16.
THou have heard therefore my brother, which, and of what kind those twelve
privileges be, which are granted to virtue in this life; which are as it were
twelve excellent and worthy fruits of that tree, which S. John saw in the
Apocalips: which was so planted by a flood, bearing twelve fruits, every
month yielding his several fruit. For what other thing may this tree be,
next the son of God, then virtue it self, which yields the fruit of
holiness and life? And what other fruits thereof are there then those which we
have reckoned up in all this part? For what fruit is more pleasant to the
sight, then the fatherly providence whereby GOD preserves his, the divine
grace, the light of wisdom, the consolation of the holy Spirit, the joy of a
good conscience, a good event of hope, the true liberty of the soul, the
interior peace of the heart, to be heard in our prayers, to be helped in
tribulations, to be provided for in our necessities: Finally, to be assisted,
and to receive ghostly consolation in death? Every one of these privileges is
truly so great in it self, that if it were plainly known, it should suffice
man to love and embrace virtue, and amend his life: and it should also bring
to pass that a man should truly understand, how well it is said by our Savior;
Whosoever forsakes the world for Gods sake, Math. 19.
shall receive a hundredth fold in this life, and possess life eternal.

Behold therefore (my brother) what a benefit it is that heretofore I have
declared unto thee, see whereunto I inuit thee, Consider if any man will say
thou art deceived, if for the love thereof, thou shall leave the world, and
all that is therein. One only inconvenient has this good (if it may be termed
an inconvenient) by reason it is unsavory to the reprobate; namely, because it
is unknown unto him. For this cause (says our Savior) the Kingdom of heaven
is like unto a treasure that is hidden: For this good is a very treasure in
deed but hidden; not to those that possess it, but to others. The Prophet
very well acknowledged the price of this treasure, who said: My secret to my
self, I^say, 24.
my secret to my self: Little cared he whether other men knew his treasure or
no. For this good is not as other goods are, which are not goods, unless they
be known by others: for which cause they are not goods of themselves, but only
in the opinion of the world, and therefore it is necessary that they be known of
him, that by that means they may be called goods. But this good makes his
possessour good and blessed, and no less warmeth his heart, when (...) only
knows it himself, then if all the world knew it. But my tongue is not the key
of this secret deske, much less of all those things which hitherto have been
spoken, for what so ever may be spoken by humane tongue, is much less and
abject then the truth of the thing it self. The key is the divine light, and
the experience, and use of virtues. This will I that thou ask at Gods hands,
and thou shall find this treasure, yea God him self, in who^ thou shall find
al things; and thou shall see with how great reason the Prophet said; Blessed
is the people whose God is our Lord, Psalm. 143.
For what can he want that is in possession of this good? It is written in the
book of the kings, that Helcanah the father of Samuel, said unto his wife that
bewailed her self because she was barren and had no children; Anna why
weepest thou? 1, Reg* 1.
and why do thou not eat? and wherefore is thy heart troubled? am not I
better unto thee then ten sons? well then, if a good husband which is to day,
and tomorrow is not, is better to his wife then ten sons, what think thou
of God, what shall he be to tha^ soul that possesses him? what do^ you
mean? whether look you* whatintend you? why leave you the fountain of
Paradise, and drink you of the troubled cesternes of thi^ world? why follow
you not the good counsel which the Prophet gives, saying: Taste, and see how
sweet our Lord is? Psalm. 33.
why do we not often pass this Ford? why do we^ not once taste this banquet?
Trust the words of our Lord and begin, and he afterward will deliver you out
of all doubt. In times past that Serpent into which Moses rod, was transformed,
seemed a far off terrible and fearful, but being neer^ and handled by the
hand, it returned into his former state. Not without reason, says Solomon. It
(...) naught, Prouer. 10.
it is naught, says every bui^er, but when he is gone he glories* The like
happens daily to thos^ men that are conversant in this affair. For not
knowing in the beginning the value of this merchandise (because they are not
spiritual, no^ have any feeling of that which lies there-vnder,) out being
carn^ll, they think it to be dear and of no value: But when they begin to
taste how sweet our Lord is, they presently glory of their reward, because there
is no price worthy of so great a benefit. Consider how that Merchaunt in the
Gospel joyfully sold all that which he had, that he might buy the field in
which he had found the treasure: wherefore therefore does not a Christian
contend hearing this name, to know what it is? Truly it is a thing to be
wondered at: If some toy-boaster should assure thee, that in thy house, and in
such a place, a treasure were hidden, thou would not cease to dig, and
seek, and prove, if that were true which he said. But wh^reas God himself
aff^rmeth* that there li^th an incomperable treasure hidden in thy mind, will thou never be persuaded to seek it out? O how quickly should thou find this
trea^u^e, if thou did only know how near our Lord is to all those that
^ruly call upon him? How many men were there in this world, who weying their
sins, and perseuering in prayer, have obtained the remi^sion of their sins
in less then on^ weeks space, have opened the earth, and (to speak more
aptl^^ have found a new heaven, and a new earth, and began to feel in
them^selues the Kingdom of God? How great is that which our Lord does* who
says: At what time so ever a sinner shall repent him of his sins I will no
more remember them* How great is this that this most lo^uing Father does, who
upon the short and scarce ended prayer or the prodigal Son, could not
contain himself any longer, but tha^ he embraced him, and receaue^ him with
great joy into his house* Return therefore (my brother) to this gracious and
bountiful Father lift up thy heart in time convenient, and fail not
incessantly to (...) At the gates of his mercy, and ass^^redly believe* that if
thou persevere with humility, he will at (...) answer thee; and show thee
the secret treasure of his love, which when thou have ap^rooued, thou shall say
with the spouse in the Can^^cles. If a man shall give all the substance of his
house for love, Cant. 8.
he s^all esteem it as nothing.

The Argument.
It greatly deceaueth a Christian man to persevere in his sins, and to excuse
himself, and say, that he will in short space amend his life; for it blinds
his soul, and buri^th it deeply in evil custom, so that he accustometh
himself more and more in sin, and causes vice to take so deep root in
man, that but very hardly it may afterward be rooted out.

CHAP. 17.
NOtwithstanding, all these which defend the cause of virtue suff^cientlie
enough, the peruerser sort have as yet certain Arguments, whereby they labor
to defend their slothfulnes. He seeks occasion that will forsake his friend:
But he that does this, is at all times woo^thy of reprehension. Prouer. 18.
For there are some, who will aunsvvere in one only word, saying: That
hereafter they will amend their lives, but that now they cannot, that they
exspect some other time, some other opportunity to perform the same; thinking
now tha^ it is hard, and that some few yeere^ hereafter, it will be more
easy* This error truly is very great, and greater then which, may not any one
be found out; For if a man will persevere in his evil life, and heap sin
upon sin* how can he afterward more easily leave them, when he shall be
accustomed in his sin and the habites of his mind are more depraved? For in
that future time which he proposes to himself (if he proceeds in his
wickedness) that evil custom will be more confirmed, and nature more weakened.
The devils power sh^^ be greater in thee: and thou shall be farther separated
from God, and therefore grow more blinder, mo^^ addicted to sin, and as it
were buried in the same. If therefore the difficulties of this cause be such,
who is he of so corrupt judgment amongst us, that believes his conversion,
will hereafter be more easy, ^he causes of the difficulties every ^^ves
increasing? For whereas dai^^ sins are heaped on sins, it is ^ot to be
doubted, but that the ^nots wher-with the soul is bound, (...) multiplied, and
the chains where^y it is tied made stronger. The ^^derstanding in time to come
shall be more obscured through the use of sin, the will shall be weakened to
good works, the appetite shall be more prone to all evil, and the will shall
be so weakened, as that the ap^etite may not be subdued thereby. Which since it
is so, how can it be that thou should believe that in ^uture time the affair
of thy con^ersion will be more easy to thee? And if thou say that thou can
not ^uer-ferry the Foord in the mor^ing, when as the water is yet at the ^est
ebb, in the evening when as the ^hannell is full, and the flood like a Sea
ouer-floweth, how can thou get over it. If it seem hard unto ^hee to root
out this new plant of ^hy offenses, what will thou do when it has taken deep
root and ^leaueth more strongly to the earth ^hen ever it did before? Put the
case that thou art now to fight with a hundredth sins, and hereafter thou
art to battle with a thousand, now with the depraved custom of one or two
years, then perchance with the imperfections of ten years* Who therefore
told ^hee that in tim^ to come thou may more ea^ily bear thy burden which
at this present thou can not sustain? when as nevertheless, both thy sins
ar^ daily multiplied, and thy evil custome^ increase? Do thou not mark^ that
these are the cauilations of euil^ debtors? who because they would not repay
the money they had borrowed, defer the payment from da^ to day.

But what amongst diverse other things shall I say of perverse cu^stome, and
the violence of his tiran^nie, which detayneth a man conf^^^med in his
wickedness? It is an ord^^narie thing, that he that drives in (...) nail,
first before he strikes it wit^ his hammer, he firmly fixes it, an^ the
second time more firmly, an^ the third most strongly: So in (...) our evil
works that we do, as (...) were with a great mallet we mo^^ deeply infixe
sin in our souls, and ^^ere cleaves it so vnmooueablie, that nothing may be
found that may draw out or expel the same. Hence it is that we often see
their ^ge to grow childish, who have consumed all their whole life in
wickedness and offense, and to ouer^^ow with the dissolutions of their
fore-passed age, although those years repugne, and nature it self abhorres the
same. And when as now nature her self is already wearied and decayed* yet does
that custom, which is as yet in force, wander round about, ^eeking for
impossible pleasures: so much may the impatient tyranny of evil custom. Hence
it is said in the book of Job: His bones shall be fil^ed with the surfets of his
youth, Job, 10.
and with him shall sleep in the dust: So that these vices have no term, nor
any end, besides that which is common to all other things namely death, the
last limit of every thing. Hence is that of Aristotle: As in ^he stroke of an
Aspis there is no ^emedy, except the parts that are poisoned be cut off, so
certain sins may only be healed by death. By death therefore these vices are
ended, although (if we will confess* the truth) we cannot truly say that they
are ended by death; for they endure always, for which cause Job also says:
And with him shall they sleep in the dust. The reason hereof is, because that
by the continuance of the old custom, (which now is converted into another
nature,) ^he appetite of vices is now already rooted in the very bones and
marrow of the soul, in no other sort then a consumption, which is fixed in the
bowels of a man, excluding all cure, and admitting no medicine. The same does
our Savior show in the resussitation of Laz^rus being four days dead* in
which he unto whom all things were easy, showed a certain diff^culty; for he
was troubled in spirit* and declared that they had need o^ much calling upon,
who are hardened in the custom of sinning, to the end they should awake.
Other dead men he revived with less^^ words and signs, that our Lord might
signify, how great a mirac^e it is, for God to raise again from death a man
buried four days and stinking, that is, to convert a sinner buried in the
custom of his sin. But the first of these four days, as witnesses Saint
Augustine, is, the delight of tickling in the heart; the second, consent; the
third, the deed; and he that attaineth this fourth day as Lazarus did, is not
raised again, but by our Saviors loud voice and lamentable tears. All these
things evidently declare the great diff^culty, which the deferring of
repentance and conversion brings with it: and that by how much longer the
repentance is deferred, by so much it is made more difficult. Consequently
also, by these it may be gathered, how apparent their error is* who say that
the time will hereafter be more easy for their amendment.

The Argument.
Penitence is not to be deferred, till the end of our lives: for then is favor
hardly obtained at Gods hands, and death is most dangerous; For he that has
lived euilly, dies worse, since according to the works, the rewards are also
a^nswerable.

CHAP. 18.
OThers are so blind and bewitched, that they are no^ content with the misdeeds
of the time past; but they persevere in the same to the end of their lives, and
reserve their repentance till the hour of their deaths. O time to be feared?
o term perrilous: And do thou persuade thy self for so small a price, to
purchase the Kingdom of heaven, and that thou can so easily attain the
seat of the Angels? See thou not yt whatsoever is done in that hour, is
more of necessity, then of will? is done rather by compulsion, then liberty,
and proceeds rather from fear, then love; and although of love, yet not of
the love of GOD, but of self-love, whose property is to fear detriment, and
to fly incommodity? See thou not that it is contrary to the law of
justice, that he that has enthralled him self all the course of his life, to
the service of the devil, in the end should come unto GOD, and require reward
at his hands. Remembrest thou not those five foolish Virgins, of whom Christ
speaks in the Gospel, which then began to prepare their account, when it was
to be justified? What other event is to be exspected by thee, if after thou art
admonished by this example, thou persevere in this thy negligence and
carelesnes? God truly can when he will inspire true repentance into thee, but
how often does he it in that hour? Aug* de vera et falsa penitentia ^ap.
17. Amb. e^hortation. ad penitent. I^ronimus in Epist. in Eusebius. tan. 9.
and how few are they that at that time truly repent?

Search Saint Augustine, Saint Ambrose, Saint Ierosme, and all the Doctors of
the Church, and you shall see how doubtfully and dangerously they speak of
this matter. Thou ^halt also understand how great thy madness is, that without
care presumest to sail so perilous a Sea, of which so exspert Nauigators have
spoken so doubtfully, and with so much fear. It is an Art to die well, which
ought to be learned in the whole life: For in the hour of death, such and so
great they be, that make us die; that there scarce remains any time to teach
us to die well.

It is a general rule, that such as the life of a man is, such also is his
death: Therefore whose life is evil, his death also shall be evil, except God
alter the same by some special privilege. This is not mine but the Apostles
opinion, who says, that the end of the wicked shall be aunswerable to their
actions: for in common speech, neither is there a good end to be exspected of
eu^ll works, neither an evil of good. Turn over all the Scr^pture, search
the divine pages, and thou shall find nothing repeated so often, as that as a
man has sowed, so shall he reap: that the wicked in the end of their lives
shall gather their fruits: that God shall give to every one accor^^ng to his
works: that the end of (...) one shall be conformable to ^he life, which he
lived: and that ^he justice of the just shall be upon ^^s head* and the curse
upon the ^^ad of the reprobate; and a thou^^nd such like sentences are every
where found in the Scriptures. If all the whole Scripture might be pou^ed
forth, that, that which issues therefrom might be seen truly nothing would
appear so often repeated, then this sentence: If all thy works are wicked,
what other prognostique can we give from this Astrolobe? If such be the end,
wh^t were the midst, and what the life it self? What other thing is there to
be exspected, that thou should gather in another life, but corruption, that
in this life have ^owed naught else but corruption? For neither (says our
Savior) do we gather Figgs of thorns, Luke, 6.
nor Grapes from briars. And if the house of a sinner be cast down to death,
Proverb. 2.
and his foote-steppes to hell (as says Solomon) what can let but that the end
be such, that the tree or wall fall on that side toward which i^ bended, and
threatened ruin? For he whose life, whose works, whos^ thoughts are wholly
inclined to hell* which he deserves; whether a^ last shall he go? where is
his place? where is his Mantion, but in hell, whether all that is his do
haste^* Whether at length shall he go to enhabite, that here walks in
interior darkness, but to the exterior obscurity? Why do thou vainly
persuade thy self, that he in the end of his pilgrimage shall come to heaven,
that readily walks, and has always vvandered toward hell?

This matter is largely handled lib. 1. of the Guide of a sinner, chap. 26.
whence these things are taken.

The Argument.
No man ought to abuse Gods mercy, nor under the hope thereof, persevere in
sin, for if the same mercy do so patiently suffer so many Insidells in this
world, and evil Christians in the Church, it will also suffer those that
sin ^o be damned.

CHAP. 19.
AND if thou say that the mercy of God is great, and that it comfort thee so
much, that perseuering in thy perverse and wicked life, thou trustest, that
thou shall be ^aued; I pray thee what sin may be more heinous? Thou say that
the mercy of God is immeasurable, for he would like an offender, be crucified
for sinners; I confess it ve^^ly to be great, for it suffers thee to break
out into this cursed blasphemy; such as is this, that thou will that his
bounty should favor thy iniquity, thou should take his cross, which he
apprehended, as a mean that the kingdom of sin might be destroyed, thou
take it as a mean, whereby sin may be protected and defended: and where
thou owe him a thousand e lives, if thou had so many, because he
sacrificed up his life for thee: there catchest thou an occasion also to deny
him that life which thou have, nay rather, that which thou receauedst from him.
Our Savior more greeueth at this, then the death it self which he suffered
for thee: for he that lamenteth not in his death, complains grievously of
thy sins by the Prophet, saying: Upon my back have sinners built, Psalm. 111.
they have prolonged their iniquity. Tell me (I pray thee) who taught thee so
to argue, that by reason that God is good, thou should conclude that it is
lawful for thee to follow sin and iniquity* The holy ghost seems to
con^lude after another manner; nam^ly* that by re^^on that God is good, he
gather^^h him to be worthy to b^ honored oba^ed, and lou^d above ^ll ^hing^.
And because God is good, it is reason also that man should be good, and hope
in him: who when he is a most grievous sinner, is ready to receive him into
grace, if with all his heart he convert himself unto him. Because God is good,
and so good, truly it is a double sin to offend so great a goodness.
Therefore by how much the more thou amplifiest the goodness of God, by so much
the more do thou make heinous thy sin which thou committest against him.
Now is it requisite, that so grievous a sin should be punished: for such is
the nature and office of the divine justice (which as thou think is not
opposite, but a sister and revenger of the Divine bounty) that it cannot leave
so enormous an injury unpunished.

P^rseuering therefore in thy sin, think not that thou have any interest in
the mercy of God but rather that his justice attends thee, and innumerable
others. Hear I pray you what the divine mercy winketh at, and suffers. Thou
can not deny me, that of a hundred parts of this world, there is but one of
them christian, and of ninety nine others, there is not one of them to be
saved. For it is without all question, that even as without the Ark of Noah in
the time of the D^luge, no man was saved, neither out of the house of Rahab in
the City of Jericho; so no man can be saved that is found out of the house of
God, which is his church.

But behold that part which is made famous by the name of the christians, and
see in what estate the Christian affairs do stand in this most corrupt
world, and thou will confess, that in this mystical body, that from the sole
of the foot, unto the crown of ye head, there is scarcly any member to be
found, that is sound. Choose any one that best likes thee, of those famous
cities, in which the steps of pure and sincere religion and doctrine are yet
extant; Run afterward through all the lesser cities, villages, and castles, in
which there is scarce any memor^ of religion left, and thou shall find the
people, of whom that of Jeremy may truly be affirmed: Walk about the ways of
Jerusalem, and behold and consider, and seek through the streets thereof,
whether you find a man doing judgment, and seeking faith, that is, a truly
just man, and I will be merciful unto him. Walk likewise not only the
Tauerns and public places, for they for the most part, are dedicated to lies,
trifles, and deceits, look into the houses of thy neighbors, (as Jeremy did)
and thou shall know that there is no man that speaks good, Chap. 2.
neither shall thou hear ought else but murmures, lies, cursings, oaths, and
blasphemies. There is no man that repents himself of his sin, saying: What
have I done?

To conclude, thou shall in effect find, that the hearts and tongues of men,
are employed in no other things, then earthly and private commodities, neither
shall thou hear GOD any otherwise named, but in oaths and blasphemies, in
which they abuse gods name; which memory of his name, God co^playneth of by the
same prophet, saying, They remember me, but not as they ought, swering untruly
by my name.

So that by the exterior signs, it is scarely known, whether this people be
Christian, or gentile: except it be after the manner that we know bells* which
are seen a far of, but are known by their sound: So may thou know them
by their oaths and blasphemies, which are merely heard; the rest can neither
be known nor judged.

But (I pray you) how may such be numbered amongst the rank of those of who^
Esaias speaks; Whosoever shall see them, shall know them, because these are
the seed which God blessed. And if the life of Christians ought to be such,
that they that behold them a far, should judge them to be the sonns of God, in
what place ought they to be reckoned, who rather seem to be scoffers,
deprauers, deceauers, and contemners of God, then true christians?

All these things are more amply discoursed by me, that thou may understand
that if (notwithstanding the mercy of God which thou pretende^t) GOD permits
so many infidells* and so many evil Christians to be in his Church, and so
many of the infidels and evil Christians to perrish, that he permits not
thee also to perrish with them, whose life thou do imitate. Did the heavens
perhaps rejoice upon thy birth, or do the judgments of God, and the laws of
the gospel then cease, that the world may be one to thee, and other to another
man? If therefore notwithstanding mercy, hell ^e so dilated, and so many
thousand souls are daily swallowed up by the same, shall thy soul only be
excluded therfrom, if thou persevere in thy sins?

What if we refer hither also those terrible examples of divine justice,
which are found in Scripture: namely, the fall of Angels, the ruin of Adam,
and those things which succeeded the same to wit, pain and misery? If we
induce the whole earth drowned by the deluge, those five Cities consumed by
fire and brimstone, Dathan and Abiron, swallowed up by the earth alive? If
Nadab and Abihu, and out of the new Testament, we add the sudden death of
Ananias and Saphira, to the precedent, what will thou think? what will thou
say? what can thou expect from the divine mercy, perseuering in thy sin? But
least thou should say, that God was severe and cruel in times past, but now
merciful and peaceable, consider that with this affability and clemency also,
he suffers al yt which thou have heard, neither shall thou be exempted or
free from these, but that thy punishment also shall attend thee, albeit thou
art called a Christian, if so be thou art found a sinner. Shall God therefore
loose his glory, because he condemns thee? Have thou I pray thee, any thing
singular in thee, for which cause God should forbear thee above any others,
with all thy good and evil manners? or have thou some immunity which others have
not, by reason of which he should not condemn thee with the rest, if thou be
no less evil then they are? Consider (I pray thee) the sons of David, to
them, for the many and singular virtues of their Father, many privileges were
promised, yet nevertheless, God would not leave their sins unpunished: for
which cause, some of the^, had an evil end. Where is therefore thy vain hope?
why do thou vainly trust, considering their ouer-throwe, that thou pertaking
their sins, shall not be damned? Thou art deceived my brother, thou art
deceived, if thou think that is to hope in GOD. This is not hope, but
presumption. For it is hope to trust, that God will forgive all thy sins, and
receive thee into favor, if thou art penitent, and forsake thy evil ways,
although thou art wicked and abominable: but it is presumption that thou shall
be saved and blessed, in perseverance of thy sins. Think thou that it is no
small fault, for it is numbered amongst those, that are committed against the
holy ghost. For he that presumes after this manner, staineth the divine
bounty with no small injury and ignominy, which in especial are attributed to
the holy Spirit. But these sins, (as witnesses our Savior) are neither
forgiven in this world, nor in the world to come.

The Argument.
The excusation that the love of the world is cause of sin, is false, and
invented by a carnal Christian, who has not tasted spiritual good, and
therefore neglects and contemns the same which are good indeed, and
embraces those that are false, frail, and temporal and which he knows not
himself. For if he knew them, he should truly perceive how light they are,
and how unworthy to be esteemed. Contrariwise, how profitable the spiritual
are, and how much to be beloved.

CHAP. 20.
But perchance thou will say, that the love of this world, and the things that
are therein, have captiuated thy heart* and led thee from the way of justice.
This is the excuse of a man that has not tasted spiritual benefits, and
therefore these carnal goods are so much esteemed by him. The clown thinks,
that there is nothing more precious then his cottage, because he has never
seen the proud and stately buildings of great cities. The infant, issuing
out of his mothers womb, mourns and weepeth, because he knows not that
the world is far more better that he enters into, then the prison from whence
he issues. The men of former times highly esteemed their cottages made of
turffe, and covered with straw, before they saw more substantial buildings. To
all these may carnal men be compared, who never saw or had experience of the
spiritual goods, neither tasted the sweetness, dignity, nobility, and beauty of
the same; and therefore they more esteem these false and frail benefits
(which indeed are nothing less) then the spiritual, which are only thought
worthy the name of benefits. For if they had known them, it could not be, but
that they should despise those that are ^arnall, according to that of the
prophet: And thou shall destroy thy silver graven plates, and thy garment made
of gold, and thou shall disperse the^, like the menstruous cloth of a woman, go
out shall thou say thereto. Even as therefore men have cast away their false
gods, after they acknowledged the true God, they also shall cast away and
despise the false goods of this world, even presently, as soon as they shall
taste the true and celestial goods. For as soon as a man has tasted the
sweetness of spiritual things (says Saint Bernard) he despises the flesh,
(that is, all the goods and pleasures of this world:) and this is the
principal reason of this error, which so much blinds the men of this world.

Besides this error, there is another, namely, that men not only know not
spiritual things but are also utterly ignorant of temporal. For it is
impossible that they should love those temporal goods and pleasures in such
sort, if they had the true knowledge of the spiritual. Tell me (I pray thee)
what is the World, with all that which is in it? (if we diligently pry into
the same, and observe the fallacies thereof, together with his weapons and
manner of proceeding,) What other thing (I say) is it? but a den of dolors and
troubles, a school of vanit^e, a market place of deceit, a labo^^th of
errors, a prison of darkness, ^ way by-layde with thieves, a lak^ full of mud,
and a sea which is co^t^nually moved with storms and tempests?

What else is the world but a sterill Land? a field planted with thorns and
briars? a Wood full of brambles? a flowring garden, but producing no fruit?
What is the world but a flood of tears? a fountain of cares? a sweet venom?
a well-pennd tragedy? a delightful frenzy?

What goods (I pray you) are found in the whole world, which are not false?
and what evils, that are not assured? H^s rest has labor, his security is
without foundation, his fear has no cause, his labors are without fruit,
his tears without purpose, and purpose without success, his hope is vain,
his ^oy feigned, and his grief true. Repeating therefore all those things
which are before spoken, if by so many reasons, examples, and experiences it
be manifestly proo^ed* that there is neither rest, nor the felicity which we
seek, to be found, but in GOD only, and not in the world, why seek we it
besides god, and not rather him in it? This it is that blessed Saint Augustine
admonishes, when he says; Run over the sea, the earth, and all things,
search the whole world, thou shall every way repent thy self, except God be
thy refuge.

The Author disputes of this matter most copiously in the guide of a Sinner,
lib. 1. chap. 28.

The Argument.
That the way of our Lord, is no more hard and difficult, but made plain and
easy by Christ and his benefits: namely, his Passion, Resurrection, and
Ascension: as also indeuouring in the same, we are assisted by the holy ghost.

CHAP. 21.
THere are some that excuse themselves, saying, that the way of our Lord is
strait and difficult, because in the same there are diverse difficult precepts,
and such as are contrary to humane affection and appetite. This is one of the
most principal excuses which sluggish and slothful men, infer in this
affayre. But they that say so, although they be Christians, and live in the law
of grace, notwithstanding, they know not ^his mystery, neither have they
learned the first letter of this law. O wretch that thou art, thou that say
^hou art a Christian, tell me, Why ^ame Christ into the world? Why ^hed he his
blood? Why instituted he his Sacraments? Why sent he^ the holy Ghost? What
means the voice of the Gospel? What the Word of grace? What includes that
most sacred name of IESV^? If thou know it not, ask of the Evangelist, and
he will tell thee: Thou shall call his Name JESUS* for he shall redeem his
people from their sins. Math. 1.


What other thing is included in this name of Savior and Deliverer, what other
thing is it to be saved and delivered from sins, then to obtain remission
of sins past, and obtain grace to estewe the same in time to come? For what
other cause came our Savior into the world, but to help thee, and to further
thy salvation? Why would he die upon the Cross, but that he might kill thy
sin? Why ri^^ from death, except to raise thee, and make thee walk in newnes
of life? Why shed he his most precious blood, except to make a medicine or
plaster, to cure and heal the wounds?

For what other cause instituted he the Sacraments of the Church, but for the
remedy of thy sins? What other fruit is there of his most bitter p^^sion, and
coming into this wo^ld, but that he might plain and prepare the way, which
before was horred and full of thorns, strait, and tedious?

This is that which the Prophet Esaias fore-tolde, that in the days of the
Messiah, Esaias. 40.
every valley should be exalted, and every mountain and hill humbled, and all
the evil, indirect, and tedious paths, should be made plain. Finally, why
besides all these things, sent he the holy Ghost from heaven, but that thy
flesh should be converted into Spy^^t? and why sent he him in the semblance of
fire, but that like fire he should inflame, illuminate and transform thee
into himself, and should lift it up, from whence at first it had descended?
Whereto serves grace, with infused virtues which are begotten thereof, but to
lighten and make the yoke of our Lord tolle^able? to make virtue easy, that
men might rejoice in tribulations, that they might hope in pe^rils, that ^hey
may ouercom in temptations? This is the beginning, this the middle, and this
the end of the gospel. It is needful also that we know, that even as one
e^rthly man and a sinner, namely Adam, made all men earthly and sinners: So
also that another man, celestial and just, to wit, Christ, came to make all
men that will receive him, celestial and just. What other thing have the
Euangel^sts written? what other are the promises delivered unto us by the
Prophets* what other things preached the A^ostles? This is the sum of (...)
Christian Theo^ogy, this is the (...) word, which our Lord (...) upon the
earth. This is that con^ummation, and abbreuiation, which Esaias said he heard
of our Lord, which so many riches of virtues and justice did consequenthe
follow.

Imagine thy self (my brother) that first thou come as a young scholar to
Christian religion, and demaundest of a certain wise Divine, what it is that
this new religion prescribes? He will answer thee, that nothing else it
requires at thy hands, but that thou be a good man; and that thou may
endeavor in this study with fruit, that the same religion gives thee
assistance: For commanding that a carnal man should be made a spiritual, it
gives the holy Spirit, and by the benefit thereof he is made spiritual.
Truly it is to be lamented, that so many years thou have borne the name of
Christ, warfared under Christ, and yet art ignorant of the difference, which is
between a Christian and a Jew, between the law of the letter, and the law
of grace. This difference herein consists, (for since thou know it not, I
will teach it thee) that the law of the letter, commands a man to be good,
and yields not strength to perform that which is commanded: but the law of
grace, both commands this, and gives grace and help to thee to be good,
and that thou may forsake thy sins. That commanded thee to fight, but gave
thee no wepons, whereby thou should overcome; it commanded thee to ^^cende
unto heaven, but showed ^hee no ladder, commanded men ^o be spiritual, but
gave them not the holy Ghost: But now all other things are far otherwise:
That former law being repealed, and other succeeded far diff^rent from the
other, and that by the merit and blood of the only b^gotten son of GOD.
Wherefore do thou; as if that old law were not yet taken away, nor Christ
had come into this world, play the Jew as yet, and trustest to thine own
strength, supposing by thine own fortitude, that the law may be ^ulfilled,
and thou justified in that sort.

Not only grace but charity also make this law light and easy, for this is
one of the chiefest effects of divine charity. August de sancta viduitate.
For which cause S. Augustine says, that the l^bours of lovers are no ways
burth^nsome, but delightsome unto them, as are those of Hunters, Faulkn^rs, and
Fishers; For in that which is b^loued (says he) either there is no labor, or
the labor is beloved. For this is the cause why Saint Paul says with so much
constancy, Romans 8.
that nothing may separate him from the love of Christ.

And if we diligently consider likewise, what Christ, and all the Saints have
suffered; it shall not be troublesome unto us to suffer persecution for
justice, and what so ever difficulty encombereth us in the way of our Lord,
will seem light unto us. By all which it may be ea^ily gathered, how the
Scriptures are to be reconciled the one with the other, whereof some say that
the way of our Lord is difficult, other say it is easy. So David: For the
words of thy lips I kept hard ways. Psalm. 16.
And in another place: Psalm. 118.
I have delighted in the way of thy testimonies, as in all riches; For this
way has two thing^s in it, difficulty, and sweetenes: one by reason of nature,
the other by grace; so that what is difficult by reason of the one, in respect
of the other is made delicious and sweet. Both of them our Lord sp^^keth of,
when he says, Math. 11.
that his yoke is sweet, and his burden light: For when he says yoke, he
signifies grau^ty, which is in the way of the Lord, but when he says sweet he
insinuates facility, which is by means of grace which is given.

But if you shall ask me, how it may be a yoke and sweet, when as the
nature of a yoke is to be heavy? To this I answer, that the reason hereof
is this, because our Lord lightneth the same, as he promises by his prophet;
And I will be unto them, as he that lightneth their yoke upon their
shoulders. Hosea, 12.
What wonder is it therefore, if the yoke be light, which our Lord
sustaineth, lifts up, and as it were he himself bears?

If the bush burned and was not consumed because our Lord was in it, what
wonder is it that the burden should be light, if in the same the said Lord
be, that helps us to bear it? Will ye that I show ye as well the one as
the other, in one and the same person? Hear what the holy Apostle says; 2.
Cor. 4.
We suffer tribulation in all things, yet ^re we not troubled, we are
approved, but not forsaken, we suffer persecution, but are not left destitute,
we are humbled, but not confounded, we are cast down but we perrish not.
Behold here on the one side there is labor and travel, on the other, comfort
and sweetness, which our Lord yields to them. Truly the Prophet Esaias
insinuates the same also, when he says; They that trust in the Lord, Esaias,
40.
shall change their fortitude, and shall assume wings as it were an Eagle,
shall run, and not be travailed; shall walk, and not be weary. Do thou
see here the yoke lightened by grace; see thou the fortitude of the flesh,
changed into the fortitude of the spirit? or that I may speak better, the
fortitude of man, into the fortitude of God? See thou how the holy Prophet
concealeth not either the trouble, or the quiet? Thou have not therefore my
brother any cause, for which thou should abhor this way* although it be
wearisome and difficult, when so many and so mighty the means be that make it
plain and easy.

The Argument.
A man ought not to defer his repentance and amendment of life from day to
day, but presently turn unto our Lord, and repent for all his sins, whereby
he has offended the divine Majesty, and his neighbor.

CHAP. 22.
WEll therefore my brother, if on the one side there be so many and so
effectual reasons, which call us to the amendment of our lives; and on the
other side we have no just excuse, that may induce us from reformation of our
ways. Tell me (I pray thee) how long do thou defer thy repentance* when
at the length will thou begin a bett^r manner of life? Look into (I pray thee^
thy fore-passed life, and search all those years which thou have lived, r^gard
the age in which thou now live; and thou sh^lt understand that it is now
time, nay rather, that the t me is past, in which for thy offenses thou were to
repent and turn to God. Remember thou art a Christian, regenerated by the
water of Baptism, that thou have God for thy Father, the Church for thy
Mother, the milk of the Gospel, a dainty that thou art nourished by, the
Apostolical and Evangelical doctrine, and that which is more worthy, with the
bread of Angels: that is, with the most sacred Sacrament of Christ's body and
blood, and by all these nothing at all bettered, but to have lived no less
dissolutely, then if thou had been an Ethnique, without having any knowledge
of God. For tell me what kind of sin is it which thou have not committed?
what forbidden tree is there, whose fruit thou have not affected? what field
which thy lust has not ouer-past? what ever has been offered to thy sight,
that thou have not desired? what appetite have thou ever resisted, under the
remembrance of God and Christian profession? what else more could thou have
done if thou had not had faith? if thou expectedst no other life after this?
If that strickt judgment of God were not to be feared? what is thy life but a
continual web of sin? a dunghill of vices? a way beset with thorns? and a
rebellion against God? with who^ have thou hitherto lived, but with thine own
appetites, with the flesh, with ambition, with y^ world? These were thy gods
these thy Idols, which thou seruedst, and who^ thou calledst upon. Tell me,
what respect had thou of Gods law and obedience toward him? even no more
did thou fear him, then i^ he had bin a wooden God. For it is most certain
that there are many Christians, that with the same facility wherewith they
would sin, if they believed God were not, do also now sin notwithding they
believe yt there is a God, they offend no less offending one, then they would
do if they believed none: And what greater injury may be done to ye divine
Majesty? Finally, believing all those things, which Christian Religion
proposes to be believed thou have so lived, as any other would have lived, who
thought all our faith to be but an old wives tale, and very ridiculous toys.

And if the multitude of thy sins that are past, terrify thee not, and the
facility wherewith thou co^mittedst them stir thee not, at leastwise what
does not his Majesty and highness move thee, against whom thou have sinned? Lift
up thine eyes and behold the immensity and greatness of that Lord, who^ the
powers of heaven adore, before whose Majesty lies prostrate, whatsoever the
circuit of the world contains: in whose presence whatsoever is created, is
naught else but a light straw: and see how unworthy it is, that thou so
abject a worm as thou art, dare so often offend and provoke the eyes of so
great a Majesty unto anger.

Consider the fearful greatness of his justice, and the memorable punishments
which from the beginning hitherto he has exercised in the world, and with
whom he has persecuted sins, not only in particular persons, but in whole
Kingdoms, Cities, and Provinces also, yea, in the whole world: neither in the
world only, but in the heavens, not only in strangers and sinners, but also
against his most innocent son, who would satisfy for all that which we
ought. Now if that be done in a green wood, and for other men's sins, what
shall be done in a dry, and for our own sins? What therefore more fondly and
more imprudently may be done, then that a vile miserable man durst delude God,
who has so powerful hands, that if he extend them, and touch him with them,
with a very little touch he can thrust him headlong into the depth of hell.

Mark besides this the patience of this Lord, who so long time exspecteth thee
as long as thou have offended him, and if thou after so many riches, and long
suffering of patience, wherewith he has hitherto exspected thee, persevere in
abusing his mercy, and provoking his wrath. He will shake his sword, Psalm. 7.
and bend his bow, in which he has prepared the vessels of death, and he will
shoot his arrows against thee.

Wey the profundity and bottomless pit of his judgments, of which we read
and daily see admirable miracles and examples. Let us behold Solomon after his
so admirable wisdom, after his edition of three thousand parables, after the
most profound mysteries he wrote in the Canticles, lying prostrate before
Idols, and reproved by God. Let us behold one of those seven Deacons of the
Primative Church, fulfilled with the light and power of the holy Ghost, made
not only an Heretic, but an arch Heretic, and an Author and Father of
heresies. We see daily many stars of the heaven fall to the earth, with a
miserable ruin, to wallow in the dirt, to eat the husks of the Hoggs, who a
little before sitting at Gods table, were nourished with the bread of Angels.
And if the just for some hidden pride, negligence, and ingratitude, were in
that man nere cast out of Gods favor, having many years faith^ully served him,
what must thou exspect who have done naught else in thy life, but offend God
instantly.

Let us see therefore now, thou that have lived thus, is it not ^^quisit^ that
at length thou give over to heap sin on sin, or conioine d^bts with debts?
Is it not needful that now thou begin to ^p^^ase God, and disburthen thy
soul? does not reason require, that thou hold thy self content, that the
remainder of that thou have bestowed on the world, the flesh, and the devil,
be given to him that gave thee all things? Is it not rightful, that after so
long a time, and so many injuries done unto GOD, thou at last fear the divine
justice, which by how much the more greater patience it tollerateth thy
sins, by so much the more grievous torments and greater justice does he
chastise sinners? Is it not woorthily to be feared, that so long a time thou
have continued in sin, so long lived in the disfavor of God, to have so
mighty an adversary, who of a gracious Father, is made a judge and an enemy? Is
it not to be feared least that the violence of evil custom be turned into
another nature, and therefrom arise a necessity of sin, and somewhat more?
Is it not to be suspected, least thou fall by little and little into greater
offenses, and that thou be delivered into a reprobate sense, into which when a
man is fallen, he has not then any reason of any thing, how great soever it be.

Jacob the Patriarch said to his Father in law Laban: Fourteen years have I
served thee, and all thy possession was in my hands, I have hitherto
administered all thy domestical affairs, it is requisite therefore that at last
I provide for mine own house. And thou, if thou have served the world so many
years, were it not convenient, that now at length thou should begin to
provide for thy soul, and somewhat more circumspectly then heretofore, regard
the happiness of the life to com? There is not any thing more short and frail
then man's life. And if thou so carefully studiest for things necessary in this
so frail life, why do thou not also employ some labor in those things,
which shall perpetually endure.

The Argument.
It is necessary that a man consider him self, and remember that he is a
Christian, and firmly assent to all things which our faith sets down,
whereto either love or fear ought to move him. What thing so ever is created,
inuiteth us to the love and service of God. Let a man therefore seek wisdom,
and he shall hear all the words of Christ, who was crucified for his
salvation.

CHAP. 23.
ALl these being thus, I pray thee now (my brother) and entreat thee by the
blood of Christ, to call thy self to account, and remember that thou art a
Christian, and believe all those things which our faith preaches unto thee.
This faith says that thou have an appointed Judge, before whose eyes, all thy
steps and moments of thy life are present: and be assured, that the time will
one day come, wherein he will call thee to account for every act; yea to the
least idle word This faith teaches a man, that when he dies, he does not
altogether perrish, but that after this temporal life, there remains an
eternal; that our souls die not with our bodies, but that our bodies buried
in the earth, our souls se^ke out another region, and a new world, where
they shall have a lot and society, aunswerable to their life and manners in
this world. This faith auoweth the reward of virtue, and the punishment of
sin to be ^o high and mighty, that if the world were full of books, and all
creatures were writers, first should the Writers be wearied, and first should
all ^he books be replenished, before either matter wanted to discourse of them
both, or sufficient might be written* what they contain in them according to
their greatness. That ^ay^h certifieth, that so great are our debts which we owe
unto God, and ^o worth^ the benefits we receive ^t his hands that if a man
should (...) so many years as there are sands ^n the Ocean shoares, they
should ^eeme of small continuance, if they ^e^e all of them consumed in the
^nely service of God. Finally, the ^ame faith testifies unto thee, that virtue
is a thing so precious, that all the treasures of this world, and all that which
man's heart can either desire or ^magine, is not any ways to be compared
therewith.

If therefore such and so many things inuit thee to virtue, how comes it
to pass, that there are found so rare and few lovers and followers of the
same? If men be moved by profit, what greater profit then eternal life? If by
fear of punishment* what torture more terrible then that of hell? If by reason
of the debt, obligation, or benefits, what greater debt then that, wherein we
are bound unto God, as well by reason of him, that is himself in himself, as
for those things we have received of him. If fear of danger move us, what
greater perrill then death, whose hour is so uncertain, and reason so strict?
If peace, liberty, tranquillity of spirit, and sweetness of life be desired
of the whole world, it is manifest that all these are more abundantly found in
the life which is led according to the prescript of virtue, then that which
(...) past over, according to a man's (...) and humane passion: for a man is
created reasonable, not a brute beast, and without reason. But if all these
seem to have but small moment to persuade virtue, shall it not suffice to see
God descend from heaven upon the earth, and made man? and whereas in six days
he had created the whole world, he consumed thirty years, and lost his life
in reforming and redeeming man. God dies, that sin may die, and we will that
that live in our hearts, to deprive thee of life, for which the very son of
God suffered death: and what shall I say more? There are many reasons in this
one, for I say not that Christ is to be beheld hanging on the Cross, but
whether so ever we turn our eyes, we shall find that all things exclaim,
and call us to this goodness: for there is not a creature in this world, if it
be well considered, that does not inuit us to the love and service of our
Lord. So that as many creatures as there are in this world, so many Preachers
are they, books, reasons, and voices which excite and inuit us to that office.
How is it therefore possible that so many voices, so many promises, so many
threatenings suffice not to work the same in us? what could God do more then
he did, and promise more liberally then he promised? and threaten mo^e severely
then he threatened, that he might draw us to him, and drive us from sins?
And is the arrogance of men as yet so great, or to speak more aptly, are men
in such sort enchanted* that having faith they fear not, to rest all their
life time in sins? to go to bed in sin? to rise and awake from sleep in
sin? I, and that with such security, and without any scruple, as that neither
for the same sleep flies from their eyes, neither their appetite to eat
perishes, in no other sort then if all they believe were dreams, or that the
Evangelists did write were lies?

Tell me thou traitor, tell me thou Titius, that art to burn in perpetual
flames of hell, what more could thou do, although that al^ that thou
beleeuest were lies? For ^ see thee for fear of temporal justice refrain thy
appetites in some sort; but for the fear of God I see thee not abstain from
any thing to which thy voluptuousnes draws thee, neither estewest thou the
revenge, neither do thou that which he commands, neither art thou ashamed
to do all that which thou desire, if thou have power to perform it. Tell me
thou blind man, tell me thou fool, in such security what does the worm of thy
conscience? where is thy faith? where is thy brain? where thy judgment, where
thy reason: which as thou art a man, is only remaining unto thee. How can
thou but fear so great, assured, and true perrils? And if a man should set
meat before ^hee and another, though a liar, should ^ay they were infected with
venom, durst thou either prove or taste the^, although they were most delicate
and sweet, and not believe the liar that told thee this? And if the Pro^hets.
Apostles, Evangelists, yea, 4, Reg. 4.
and God himself should affirm and say unto thee, Death is in that pot, etc.
^eath is in this meat, o wretched ^an, death is in this little pleasure which
the devil presents thee with, ^ow can it be but that thou shoul^^^ be afraid
to take Death with thine own hands, and drink thine own perdition? what does
that faith do ^eere in thy heart? what the judgment? what the reason that thou
have? where is thy light when as none of these can stay the stream of thy
sins? O wretch, frantic, senseless, strooken with astonishment by the
enemy, condemned to perpetual darkness interior and exterior, for from this
to these is a short cut; blind to see thine own misery, ignorant to understand
thine own harms, and harder then adamant that feel not the mallet of the
divine word? O, a thousand times miserable, worthy whom all men should
bemoane, not in other tears the^ he shed for thy perdition, who said; O if
thou likewise had known, L^k, 19.
yea even in this thy day, the things that belonged to thy peace^ what to thy
tranquillity, what to the riches which God has prepared for thee, but now they
are hidden from thine eyes. O wretched day of the nativity, but more wretched
the (...) of thy death, which shall be the be^ginning of thy perdition. Alas
(...) far more better had it been that thou had never been borne, then
perpetually to be damned? How far better had it been, if thou had not been
baptized, nor professor of the faith? for because thou have abused them, thy
damnation shall be the greater. For if the light of reason suffice to make the
Philosophers inexcusable, Romans 1.
because when they knew God, they glorified him not, neither thanked him as
God, as says the Apostle: How less excusable are they, who having received
the light of faith, and the water of baptism, so often times come to his
supper to receive God himself, and daily hear his divine doctrine, if they
do no more then those Philosophers? What other thing is to be concluded of all
these which are hitherto said, then that there is not any either understanding,
wisdom, or counsel in the world, then that forsaking the occupations and
impediments of this life, we follow the only and certain path, that leads us
to true peace, and eternal life. To this reason, equity, and the law inuit
us, to this heaven, earth, hell, life, death, justice, and Gods mercy: To this
especially the holy ghost exhorts us by the mouth of Ecclesiasticus, saying:
Eccles. 6.
My son receive learning from thy youth, and thou shall find wisdom in thine
old age. Even as he that ploweth, and he that sows come unto her and
sustain or expect the fruits thereof with patience: For in the work thereof
thou shall labor but a little, and quickly shall thou eat of the generations
thereof: Hear my son, and take the counsel of understanding, and despise
not my precepts. Thrust thy feet into her fetters, and into her chains thy
neck: subject thy shoulders and bear the same, and thou shall not be weary of
her bonds. Search her out, and she will appear unto thee, and being made
continent leave her not, for in the later times shall thou find rest in the
same, and it shall turn thee unto joy. And her fetters shall be unto thee a
protection of strength, and foundations of virtue, and the garments thereof a
stool of glory: for the ornament of life is in her, and her bonds a healthful
thraldom. Hitherto Ecclesiasticus: By which words in some sort is understood,
how great the beauty, how great the delights, how much the liberty, how many
the riches of true wisdom is, which is virtue it self, and the knowledge of
God, of which we now speak. And if all these are not sufficient to conquer thy
hurt, lift up thine eyes on high, and do not thou regard the waters of this
world which perish and vanish away: But behold the Lord that hangs on the
Cross, dying and satisfying for thy sins: He hangs there, in that form you
see exspecting thee with his feet fastened with rough nails, his arms
opened to receive thee, his head bowed, that like to a prodigal son, he may
give thee the kiss of new peace. And from the Cross he calls thee, if
perhaps thou hear him, with so many voices he cries unto thee, as he has
wounds in his body.

Imagine this most blessed Savior speaking to thy heart, and saying; Return,
return thou Sunamite; Cant. 6.
return, return, and I will receive thee. I know thou have committed
fornication with many lovers, Iere. 3.
yet return to me, and I will forgive thee: Return to me because I am thy
Father, thy God, thy Creator, thy Savior, thy true friend, thy only
benefactor, thy absolute felicity, and thy last end. In me shall thou find
rest, peace, salvation, truth, wisdom, and all goodness: In me shall thou find
the fountain of living water, which extingsheth all thirst, and makes a man
attain everlasting life. In me shall thou be as a tree planted by the water
side, that yields his fruit in due season, and his leaf shall not fall, all
that thou do shall prosper.

Incline thine ear therefore my brother and hear: for if his prayers be
execrable, that hears not the cry of the poor, much less shall he be heard
that is deaffe here, and hears not these prayers and lamentations.

The end of the first part.
