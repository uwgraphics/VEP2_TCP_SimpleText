The Prologe of the noble hand work of Surgery.
TO ye laud of our savior Christ Ihesu. and the honor of his blessed mother
our lady saint mary. and all the holy co^pa ny of heuyn. and for the help of
mankind / this book is translated out of duche in to englis^he And for ye love
and comfort of all them that entende to study the noble art of Chyrur gia /
ye which is called the handyworke of Surgery / very vtyle and profitable to all that entende to occupye this noble sciens ye herein is openly expressed and
showed / how it shall be practysed and vsyd / For many one is therein very
ignoran^t yt will meddle there with / which never labored nor never sa point of
ye beginning or ending thereof / wherefore it is often times senc and daily
chances in small towns / borowghs / and vyllages / that lyefarre from any
good cite or great town ye dyuerie people hurt or dyseased for lack of
co^nynge men / be taken in hand of them yt be barbers or yo^ge masters to
whom this sciens was never dysclosed / not thinking on the words of the old
lernydmen that say / It is not well possible to man that he should bring well
to a good end yt thing which he never or has but little seen. Thus ye young
studyntys / masters / and ieruau^tes of barbers and surgyens that entende this
noble art and co^nynge / behold / ouerse / and read with diligence this
little book that I Iheronims Bruynswyke borne in Straesborowgh / out of the
line of Salerne / has with great labor co^pyled / set / and gadered together
to your behoof and great profyt this little volume / thinking on many noble
auctours in diverse bokys / which playuly does specesy / Iursyd be those that
god has with co^nynge endewed to the health / socour / and help of mankind /
and will not occupye it. But vlessyd be they that among his even christian will
lyberally sheme and mynistre such gifts of grace as god has endewyd him
with for the preserua cyon of man. Wherefore my frendys think yt ye may now for
a little money have great learning and co^nynge to your honor and profit / the
which herafter ye might fortune not to get for ten times so much gold as it
should cost you now.

Oye young brgynnynge surgyens unclose yourerys w all your dyligence and mark
well the words of the great masters which command you when ye be called
or desired to any pacyent or diseased parsone / that if the dyseas fall to your
co^nynge to ponderous / and that ye be not fully parfyte / than be not ashame
but quicly get another dyscrete surgyen or ^mayndesyrynge them that they will
help and^ sell you in yt besynes at your need * sor yo^ honesty lyath in that
cure / and also the great comfort of your paeye^t so dy^eased. Ey^st ye learn
by chance / that thing that ye seldon or never have seen before. Sero^darily
/ if ought in your hands happen to mysfortune * that ye other may quycly than
amend it. Thyrdly / that the wounded parson have ye less grudge or mystrust
in you. Fourthly / Wha^ the cure has good speed / tha^ be ye parttaker of all the honor thereof / and if yt mysfortune fall between your handys / than be
they bound every man to bear the charge of your hinder and losses / which
were to much for you alone.

Fyftly / for this wise deed ye be praised of all them that be discrete or
learned men yt speak of you / which say / he desires to learn / and will not
that any man should be by him neglygently spylt or peryshed. and thus mayye
come to yone poncpose with honesty and pleasure / which else might turn to
yourgrete shame and dysplesure.

Also ye may consydere that two may better amend a fawte tha^ one / for no
only workman can well parceyue the fawtys of his own work alone till he has
very long wrought upon it / or else nere hand fynyshte hit / and than is it
sometime evil and ipostyble to be mendyd / but pryncypally in many operacyons
belongyng to surgery / Therefore when ye go two or more about the pacyent / take heed that ye make no dyscorde* In like wise when any of you be present alone
with your pacyent / blame ^at the other that is absente / nor dyffame him not
But what ye have to say with each other let that be secret within your self
for grewynge of your pacyente / for it might turn him to great pain and
hyndraunce in his dyseas through your dysco^forte. The one shall follow the
others counsel and (...) shall ^^de nothing from each other that ye shall
think profitable and beho^ for your pacyent or seek body / for (...) turn
you to shame / and him to great pain. Also ye ought not only to be ^^pert in
surgery but also in astronomy or philosophy / wher^ore ye shall dyligently
study and often read such things as for you in this matter or scyens shall be
vtylle and profitable whereby ye shall have parfytte understanding and knowledge
of your noble science that ye do enterprise / ye shall for no gold nor silver
take in hand ye thing that ye think is incurable / or not lykely to be cured
/ for sauyge of your goodname Also ye shall not praise yourselfe / nor blame
none other. Item ye shall also counforte your pacyent how so ever it be with
him but to his good frendys ye shall show the truth and give them parsyte
knowledge of his dyseas. Also ye should know and under stand parfytly your
Anathomia / which is the gaderynge and also ye dysme^brynge of the lymmes of
ye body / becauseye should preserve man for the iopardy of death / if it need
required that ye should cut him in any place wout doing to him any scathe and
to yourselffe an everlasting / shame / and great dyshonesty.

Here begins the handworke of Anothomia in general / of ye members / skin
flesh / veins / senowys / and bonys.


The Anothomia in general
THe skin is a covering of the hole universal body wouen out of the veins
and senewes / made for the defense of ye wits of man / and ye same skin is
twain indyffere^t. The one does cover the uttermost membre / and that is named
the very skin / The other covers the innermost part of the membrys and it
is named panniculus / or pannycle / and that is as a flece / like as by the
felles or chambres of the brain / and pyrocraneum is ye thyn flece above the
braynpanne / and ye pa^nycle of the rybbes is named Pleura and Siphac / and the
pannycle of the heart and other. etc. Here after follows the fatnesses / some
is within the skin and that is na / med greece / some is within by ye belly
about the kydneys and that is named talowe

Tha^ comes the flesh which be in. iij. manners / some is pure simple flesh
/ as is only the yard and the go^mys of the tethe / that other is as carnel^ys
/ like the flesh of the coddys and of the breast / the iij. is co^pre hendynge
almost ouerall the hole body and is named caroplena lacertis. Than begins
the synewes to take their effect of the brains and of the mary of the back /
After yt the veins takes their effect of the liver and of ye heart. Than
follows the bonys of ye body / and of them be in no^bre. CC. xlviij. beside ye
small bonys that be called ossa cisanina and the bone laud / whereon ye tongue
is fowndyd. The nails be made on the uttermost part of ye me^bres because
they should ye stronghyer grype and hold all manner of things. The hear is
ordained for fayrnes and to purifye the manyfolde partis of the body.

The anothomia of the composyde membris. Ca. ij.
HEre begins of the heed / and pryncypally of the brains / and of the pa^n^
that keeps ye brains together / for that is ye place and dwelling of ye
reasonable soul and all that is heared is named the (...) of the head / and
therein be ye understanding members / and that is in the highest part of man /
the quantyte of the brains of mankind is much more tha^ it is of any other
reature / considering the strength of man agyanst the gretnes of other do^me
creatures. The pertyes of this pa^ne be. x. or. xj. first without is the hear
/ than ye skin / than flesh of lacertes / than a gross pannycle or flece /
than the pan / than ^in be ij. small fleces named dura matter / and pia matter
/ than the substance of the brains / and after the substance of ye brains is
again pia matter / and after that / lyath that marvelous net and is named Rethe
mirabile / and tha^ above that is named the fou^dacion of the brains / out of
the which the senewes take their beginning. That panicle that is named of
Galien^ pericraneum does covers all the hole pan / and is somewhat like to
senewes / and grows of dura matter / and of her is strongly bownde senewes and
veins / after this is craneu^ found and is named the pan of the heed / and
that is not a hole bone / but. vii. bonys ordained to each other / and that is
because of this / yfone by fortune were hurt in ye one bone / yt the other
should not be perysshed / and they be gadered together like a seem or a thing
like the tethe of. ij. sawes joined in one / to thentent that the some of the
heed should have an yssewe. The first bone of the pan is named coronale
going from the myddest orbitarum to the ^whart joints of the pan / and
therein be hoolys of ye iyen and the out berynge of the nose / depart through a
little bone like a cock^s comb / but in ye women it is often founden that the
coronale is divided ouertwhart in the myddest of the forheed. The. ij. bone is
of ye hinder part / and named occipiciale / and is closyd through a ioynte
coming over thwarte ilyke manner of this figure / and is hard / and through
persed / where as Nucha which is the mary yt co^mith in / and through ye rydge
bone or chyne to ye end of the back The. iij. and. iiij. bone be in the myddys
of syd^am and be named Parietales / and be divided through a joint by ye length
of ye pa^ne coming to the bonys of ye eerys / and they be iiij. square. The.
v. and ye syxt bone be called Petrosa for their hardness / and also they be
named Me^dosa / and they be gaderyd with ye bonys by ye sides where as the holys
of ye erys and the clensynge of the breast be in / and be led toward ye
commyssure of the bone land to ye myddys of the temple bonys. The. vij. is yt
fundament bone named Basillare / and is facyoned like a cradyll / and
supporteth all the for said bonys above the rose of the ^o^th / thus ye shall
understand yt there be vi^. manner of bonys in the pot of the heed which is
all the vpperparte. thus is to be understand that therbe. vij. boys that keep
the brains in. / yet there be other bonys yt be no pryncypallys as ye bone
c^yste which deuydeth the nose thryllys between the coronall bone / and there
be other bonys that be named Paria belonging to the face / and not to the
pan / also there be crokyd bonys under the bone of the eerys where as musculus
is planted in / which opyn ye Jawe bonys. The lymmys that in the inner part of
the heed be holden we can not show parfytely with ye Iye nor kno^^ therefore we
shall deuyde ye (...) pan with a saw roundabou^ heed / and when they lift up
ye (...) per part from the neder part / ye first that follows is dura matter
and pia matter / and be ij. s^nowlyke pa^nycles / wyndynge about and keeping in
the holl substance of the brayn / and of dura matter grows through the
co^missures of ye pa^ne pericraneu^ / and of pia matter is genyn ye fode of the
brains / and of he^ co^myth veins and vain strigys from withinforth through
ye holys of the undermost bonys / and without forth through ye co^mys^^res of ye
uppermost bonys.

The knowledge of ye. x. wits. v. interyall. and. v. common wits. as it
scewyd i^ ye picture of the heed. (...).

AFter pia matter follows ye substance of the brain / and is soft whyt / and
round of figure when the addycyons be taken from her The brain has. iij.
cellys or chambers somewhat long / and each celle has. ij. partis / and in
every part is a part of our understanding / In the first celle is our common
wyttis / as it is expressly seen in this figure of ye heed / and these be they
Seeing in ye iyen / Smelling in ye nose / Tastynge in ye tongue / Herynge in ye
ears / and Fylynge ouerall ye body. In the second is the ymagynacyon / in the.
iij. is wynynge and reason / in ye. iiij. is remembrance and memory / and there
be ways from the one to ye other / to the^tent that ye spirytis may have their
fre course from one to another / and in the first celle be more addycyons
wherein is closyd our smelling / and thereof grows. ij. couples of synowes /
and they be led to the iyes / to the erys / to the tongue / to the stomach /
and to other lym^es through holys closyd with pa^nycles. By the second cell^
mark the place yt is named lacuma / vermiformis / anchaformis / and the
cornell flesh. And under ye pa^nycle is rethe mirabile yt only is wouen with
vaynst^ingis coming from the heart / in the which is co^prehendyd and under
fonge ye quick and understanding spiritys. Finally / mark how that nucha or
that rydge bone mary grows of the last part of the brain / whereof
pryncypally all our meuynge and understanding synowys have there first
original begyn^yng / and thus is ye A^nothomia of ye brayn pa^ne openly known
and may suffer many wou^der and hurtis / but ye never ye brayn ye wors. and in
ye workynge of the heed if need require you shall cut ye same flesh of the
heed according as ye here gothe which way so ever it be.

The anothomia of the face. ca. iij.
THe pertys of ye face be these / ye forheed browys / iyes / eerys / templis /
chekys / mowth / iawys / with her tethe. The forheed has but ye skyn^e upon ye
musculy / or flesh called lacerte / for ye bone yt is under it is of the
coronall bone / and is raised toward ye upper table like a dowble bone and
makes ye form of ye brows. The brows be made for beauty / and set above ye
iyen with here for to defend them / ye cuttynge yt is done to them must go after
ye lenght of the body / and not ye way yt ye frounces go. The iye^ be ye
instrume^tis of ye sight / and be ordained a part in ye coronall bone by ye
bonis of ye temple / ye iye^ be made of. vij. cotys and. iiij. humors / The
first cote is without forth and is named / co^iunctiua alba / and grossa / that
ro^neth about the iye / and grows of the pa^nycle that covers ye brayn
pa^ne / after this there be. iij. materyall circles yt run about the iye /
and because they be so different of colors they be called yride or rain bowys
/ there be. iij. of these cotys yt comes from the side of ye brains / and.
iij. from the utter partys / ye first cote grows of dura matter / ye inner
part thereof is named scly^otica / ye uttermost part is named cornea The other
cote grows of pia mr^. / ye iner part thereof is named secu^dina / and the
utter most thereof is named v^ea / and has the hole of the ball of the iye. The
third grows of the senowe optico / the inner part thereof is named retina /
and the vttermoste thereof upon the bright crystalline is named Aranea / and to
this be. iiij. princypall moystours The first moystour is named cristallyna /
and it is set in the myddis of the iyen / and is of color like crystal / and
is facyoned like a hayll stone / wherein the sight is pricypally fou^dyd / after
yt toward ye braynis is vitreous humor which holds and circuyteth from
behind ye crystalline humor and these twain be wo^de about with one pa^nycle in
ye senewe optico / after yt from before is the humor albugyneus and yt is
whytysshe / and is conclud^d between ^he (...) be before said and the web yt
grows of pia matter: G^enus alegith another moystours and is in ye region of
the balle of the iye / and that is clear of a heavenly element color and is
hole fomys^he or sco^mye / and this is the co^posyssyon of the iye in him
self. The iye has cartilag^ above and under which we name the iye lyddis with
here that close from above with one musclus / and opyn with twhart musclus. The
nose has flesshy / ^onye / and grystly partis / the flesshy perte has a
skyn^e and. ij. musclus by each other and the bony part has. ij. tryangle
bonis / which corners comes on the nose shyftynge them on the one side alonge
ye nose / coming down to ye cheke / the grystyll perte is of two manners /
the one is without that ^acyneth the utter part of the nose / and ye other
deuydeth the ynner part of the nose thryllys. And the. ij. holys of ye nose
ascend upward to ye bonys colatorij / and be addyd to mamillares cerebri /
where as ye smelling has his begyn^ynge / and these go bacward down to the
rowfe of the mowth behynd vuula^ / through which holys is drawyn the brethynge
vapor / both out and in / and the superfluyte of the brains puryfyde. The
eeris be grystly upon ye petrosu^ bone ordained for to here / to the which yt
come otwahrt holys unto the ^enewes of ye brayn^es where the heerynge is /
under the eerys is flesh like carnellis that makes the puryfienge of ye
brains / by the which goothe. ij. veins yt convey ye spermatyke or seedly
matter or substance down to the ballockis. The temples / leyres / chek^ / be
the partys of the sydys of the face / and have in them much musclus flesh:
first there be. vij. meuyng the chekys and the upper lyppys / after these be.
xij. that meue the undermost Jawe bone / some openyng it that come from beside
the erys / and some closing it / and they come from above beside ye temples
bonys / and if they bewou^dyd / it is great ieopardy. Though it seem yt there
be but ij. bonis gadered to geder above the nose / yet some say there be
nine.:* There be. v. partis of ye mouth / ye lyppys tethe / tongue / rowfe / and
vuula / ye which is a little deem hanging in ye throat like the spynne. The
teeth of the nature of the bonys / and of them be. xxxij. that is in every
cheke ^one or Jawe xvi. of the which ij. be named duales. ij. quadrupli. ij.
canini* ij. caysales. iij. molares. and have rotis festenyd in the Jawbonys /
some one rote / some ij. some more. The tongue is a soft flesshy / and spongy
part / made of many seynowes / stryngys / and veins / pricypally ordained for
the spece and favorable taste / and to rule the mete in the mouth. Under ye
tongue is a cornell flesh / where as. ij. holys like mouths be in / where the
spetyll comes out of: Behind the tongue is the Jawflesshe by (...) rowf of ye
mouth with knotys like an (...) and between those. ii. hangs vuula (...)
says / and is ordained to take the air and to make it apt. The upper perte
of ye mouth is named the rowf / and is covered with a pa^nycle / and takes his
beginning on the forner part of ye mawe or stomach.

Of the neck / and back bone. Ca. iiij.
TWo parts be in the neck / some do holden / and some be holden / The holdyng
parts be these / shynne flesh / muscl^ stryngys / and bonys. The pertes that
be holdyn be these. the throat bolle or trachea / ^sophagus or meri / that is
where the mete gothe through Epiglotu^ or gula / veins and strings / and a
part of nucha. First is trachea arteria / that is a way of the brethe or ayr^
coming from the longues to the throat which is gaderyd and bound to the
side of merry with a strong and soft pa^nycle / after the throat on the
spondyles is merry / or ysophages / and is a way of the desce^dyng of our sode
/ and gothe from the throat to dyafragma and is made^ out of. ii. cotys. the
innermost is festyned with ye skin of the mouth / and the uttermost cote is
festyned to the pa^nicle of the belly and is fleshye / on these. ii. ways on
the side of the mouth is Gula or Epiglotus / and is a grystly part made for
the voce / and is the place of the swelowynge down.:. Here after follows ye
dowble senowes to the stomach / and to the lymmes descendynge / and again
ascendynge upward by Epyglotes. After these be great veins and strings named
Guidegi / or Apopleti / or subetales. The divided pertes go upward through the
sides or the neck unto ye highest parts / and the cuttynge of these be very
ieoperdus. Spo^dyle or rydge bone is al through percyd or boryd / where as
Nucha or back mary gothe through / and there as ye senowes in the side gothe up
and down / the back is it that gothe from ye heed to the rompe bone out of
many and strong spondyles following each other for the defense of the back
mary which be. xxx. in no^bre. vii. in the neck.. xii. by the shulders. v. by
the lymmys above the hyppys. and after the bone called the holy bone / there
be. iiii. In the neck be. vii. sto^dyles through ye which gothe. vii. cowpies
of senowes from that part of Nucha that gothe throught it / the which bear me
uyng to the shulders / armies / and some places of the heed and neck Thus do as
before is said in the neck / and work by ye length for it is the right way
of al ye pertes in ye neck.

Of the shulders / armies / and the great hands. Ca. v.
DEscendyng from ye neck does follow a graet rysynge like a hill / and on the
highest part thereof the shulders be pla^tyd / and yt shulder bonys be twayn
First behid is one broad and thyme on the back party / and on yt side of the
ioyntys it is somewhat long and round like a haft with. iii. edgys / the first
is holowe / the other above crooked and sharp like ye byll of a crane. That
other bone is named Os furfale / or the forked bone / and is round and
festyned in a holownes in ye upper part of the breast / and has. ii. branches
like a forke / the one gothe to the one shulder / and the other gothe to the
other shulder / and byndyth the. ii. sharp and crokydendys / and is a hole
deffence and preserving of all the shulder wyntys. The part under the ioyntys
of the arm pyttys is made of cornell flesh / wherein is showed the purging of
the heart Galienes deuydeth the arm in. iii. great partys / the first part is
a boue ye oxcellys or arm pyttys. the other part is namyde the little arm /
and the third ye little hand. The stryngys and opyne senowys that be found
in the arm coming to the oxcellys and there be deuydyd in twayn. The one goth
on the highest of the armies / and that other part to the undermost part of the
armies.. The veins that ascend be divided in branches / and the one goth up
behind the shulders to the heed / the other descendyth and is yet divided in
twain other branches / where of the one brau^che is divided through the arm
on the utter side in diverse placys / and is named funis brachii / which is the
rope of the arm. The other brau^che comyth up through the upper part of the
arm and is opened and showed through ye bendynge of ye elbowe / and is named
Cephalica or the chef vain. From thens it comyth for the on the hand between
ye thombe and the fore finger / and is named cephalica ocularis. The other
veins from the oxcellis that come to the under part of the arm show them
self in ye bought of ye arm / and is named basilica which is the vain of the
liver / and from thens it descendyth down between ye gold finger and the
little finger / and is named saluatella / when the ii. fornamyd vaynys be in
the bought of the arm / than is there another vain seen between them both /
and is named mediana corporalis / and thus there be in the arm. v. great
veins / and so many strings / the which be very ieopardus to staunche if
they were woundyd or cut. Of Nucha through ye spondiles of the neck descendynge
to every arm. iiii. pryncypall senowes / that meue and stere the aduitory or
little arm / and out of it comes. v. senowes into the hand that meue the
fyngers / and they show the^ self openly on the three fyngers toward the
ioyntys / which is dangerous to be wounded. In ye arms be great stryngys and
stryngys the come from the bonys going through ye ioyntys / and keep them
joined / the which were very ieopardus to be cut. The bone named vlna or
adiutoriu^ / is a great bone full of mary / and round at both endys / but
above it has but one rou^dnes / and beneth it has. ii. and the uppermost goth
into the holowe of ye ga^bone / and makes the joint of the sholders / and the
nether end which has. ii. rou^dnes is divided in. ii. and goth into ye
holownes of the. ii. bonys that be named focilium / and they make the ioyntys
of the elbowes where as the little arm begyn^eth / in which little arm be
ii. focill bonys / that be named ossa focilia / and the grettest is benethe /
and that goth toward ye little finger / and show a rownde knot outward / the
small focille bone goth above from the bought of the arm to the hand toward
the thombe / and in both ye upper part of these. ii. bonys be pyttes / or
holys by ye elbowe / and receive the roundnes named graduales / of the bone
called aduitorii / by the handys they have pyttys also / which receive the
roundne of ye ioyntys of the hand / and be festenyd just unto the bonys of ye
hand making ye ioyntys / the which ioyntys be. iii. hepys of bonys / and ye
uppermost be gadered with a round nes in the pyttes of the nethermost. In the
first hepe be. iii. bonys / for the addycion of focilles keeps above the place
of a bone. In the second hepe be. iiii. bonys / and there above is a little
box wherein is festenyd ye first bone of the thombe. The bonys of the ii.
fornamyd hepys be short. The first hepe is named rafeta / or corpse. The other
hepe is named Pectenor Metacorpus.. In the iii. hepe be. iiii. bonys longer
than the first In every finger be. iii. bonys / and the fyngers be in nombre.
v. therefore there be xv. bonys in the fyngers. And in the (...) xi. ii. in the
little arm. i. in the upper (...) And thus there be in the hole arm and hand
xxix. bonys. and these must be cut for to becurydall long ways / like as the
sacerres and musclus gothe..

The Anothomie of the breast and his parties a me^bres Ca. vi.:.
THe parties in the breast be some holden and some that be holde^ The pappys or
brestys be made as it were a cornelly whyt flesh like a sponge / made with
veins / stryngys / and senowes / and there fore they have a festenynge of the
liver and of the heart. The lacertes or musclus be many and diverse some with the
skin named Dyafragma / some do be long only to the breast / some to ye rybbes /
and some to the back. Therbe. iii. manners of bonys in the breast. In the first
part be. vii. bonys named ossa thoracis Thereby on the side of gula is receyuyd
the holowes of Fircula / and under fircula by the ^roppe of the mawe or
stomach is a grystly addytamente named Cusifornu^. On the hinder part be.
xii. spondiles where as nucha passes through / whereof wax or grow. xii.
cowple of senowes / ye which bring sterynge and me nynge to ye musclus or
flesh of that part On every side be. xii. rybbes. vii. ryghtewys rybbes /
and v. mendosa rybbes or faint rybbes be cause they be not hole as ye other
ryghtwys rybbes ^e. For to do the Anothomia well of the lymmes that be holden
ye must cut the breast towardys the lyde / and put away the first part for
mediastum / and than may ye inner part be seen / of ye which the heart is the
first in the myddest of the breast / descendynge a little toward ye left side
/ for the place of the liver / and to thentent that it should give rome or
place to ye stryngys. The form or shape of the heart is like a pyne aple / for
the point of ye heart gothe toward the neder lymmys or membrys of the body /
and the bread of the which is ye root gothe vpwardys. The substance of the
heart is hard having on every side a ve^trycle or holownes / and in ye myddyst
a pytt as Galienes says / in which is consumed the gross fedynge blood that
comes from the liver / and is made pure / and is sent by the veins
throughout all the partys of the body. First to the brains / and there it
conceyueth another nature and becomes animalis or understanding / and to the
liver where as it becomes natural and fedynge / and to the stonys or coddys
for generacyon / and so forth to all other membrys or lymmes / and makes them
quycke or gives them life. The heart is an instrument of al powers and might
of the body / and a fulcome^ bond or festener of ye soul / and in it be. ii.
orificias or mowthes and through the right orifice ro^neth a brau^che of ye
ascendynge veins / bringing up the blood from the liver / and descendith
from thens downwarde again to vena arterialis for to feed ye longues. Of the
lift orifice gothe ye betynge vain / named vena pulsatilis / whereof one part
gothe to ye longues / and it is named vena venalis / berynge the vapors
capinosos to the lo^gues / and ledynge the air in / for to cole the heart with
all / upon this orifice be. iii. pa^nycles or skyn^es opynyng and closing /
the passage of ye blood. By this orifice be. ii. little eerys joined to the
heart / where as the air or breath goth out and in toward the longues. Also
there is a little grystell bone in it for to strength the heart with. The heart is
coueryd with a strong pa^nicle named precordiu^ / where as the senowes come to
/ and be bound with ye longues festenyd / and subportynge through mediastinu^.
Upon ye heart comes ye longues fleing and wauynge for to cole it / whose
substance is spongye / whyt and soft / in yt which be. iii. holownessis.. The
first is ye veins which grow out of ye right ventrycle of the heart / and
the vain that grows out of the lift ventrycle / and the branches yt comes
from the throthe bring wind or breath to ye heart. The longues has. v. lobos
or feders. iii. in the right side / and. ii. in those ft side. Behynd the
longues / after the. v. spondyle goth merry / and ye vain tracea asce^dynge /
and both these pass through dyafragma. Also there pass through it matter
adorthi that does ascend from the heart / all these with the vein Trachea
make a hepe fyllyd with pa^nycles and strong bondys / and with caruelly
flesh to gula. After this be in the breast. iii. pa^nycles. First the pa^nycle
that from within does couere the rybbys named Pleura. The other is mediastinu^
/ and departyth the hole carkes in both sides. The third is dyafragma / and
yt deuideth ye spyrytuall lymmys or me^brys from ye fedynge me^brys / and is
made out of pleura and syphac / and of the short pa^nycle that growyth of the
senowes between ye spondyles and is most by ye rybbes / whose operacyon is for
to draw the air to her / and for to withdryue ye superfluyte as Galienes
testyfyeth.

Of ye belly and his me^brys. Ca. vii.
Merry is ye croppe of ye neck going inwardly through ye neck / till yt he
makyth a hole through dyafragma / where un to he is fast bound / and dyafragma
goth into ye last perte of ye breast there as ye mouth of the mawe or stomach
does sprede him. The work of the stomach is dysgestyon / for it has ye liver
on the right side / warning herself with the lo^bys or lymmes / and ye mist
thwart on ye lift side with her fat veins for to drive away mela^coly or heaviness
/ for to lyghte^ and releue ye apetite. Above it is (...) gyuyng her quyknes
unto ye brains lo^ have ye vndsta^dyng of felyng. Also it has of ye back
perte ye senowes named chylym and adorthi / where as it is bound with / unto ye
spo^diles of yt kydnes. Unto ye vndmost mouth of ye stomak begyn^eth the guttys
/ and they be in no^bre. vi. ye first is named duodenu^. for he is xii. inches
long. and is also named portenarees / for he is ye vndmost per^e of ye stomach
/ like as meri is uppermost. The. ii. is ylio^ / and is long and small / and
is wou^de^ up by ye back and by ye lyskes The. iii. is ieiuniu^ / for he is
ever emptye / because he is so nygh the gall / and there come to hi ye small
veins mise raice / and he receives ye colera yt comes between hi and
portenariu^. The. iiii. is ceces or sacces / and is ye blind gut / or second
mawe or moke / and is about ye length of a shaftme^t / and has. i. orificiu^
to receive ye hole fylthynes yt co^myth of ye first dysgestyo^ of ye bowels.
The. v. is named Colon / and is gross fullof holownes / where as ye fyshynes
receives her form. The. vi. is named Longaon / and that is the ars gutte. The
Liver is a place and an organ of the second dysgest yo^ engendryng blood set
in the right side under the short rybbes / and is formed like a moan / and
has. v. little pa^nys in the manner of a hand / wherewith passes above the
stomach. The Liver with her pa^nycle is bound on Dyafragma with the back /
stomach / and gutte / and has collygacyo^ with the heart / kydney / coddys /
and with all me^brys Her substance is redflesshy like blood that is stollydor
ro^ne / and is full of synewes. Of the holownes of the liver comes a vain
named the gate / and is divided in many small veins that be named miseraice /
yt be pla^tyd in ye stomach / and in the guttys and draw out all the moisture
of the vain Chyli / and is divided with her rotys through all ye liver / and
of the hill of the liver comes the vain Chylis / and draws from the liver
all the blood that is in it engendered / beryn ge that blood for to feed ye hole
body. In the myddys of ye liver where it is holow does lay a little bladder yt
is named the gall or deyned to receive ye superfluyte of Colera / and it has.
ii. oryfyces / one in the myddest of ye liver for to receive the colera. The
other gothe alo^ge down by the bothom of ye sto make / for to puryfye the
guttys and to drive out the colera. The mylt is ordained in the left side
ouerthwartly enbrasynge ye stomach / and is bound with her pa^nycle to iii.
eybbys with her back / and with her holow nes to ye stomach The kydners be
twain the one is ordernid for to purysy the blood and the watery superfluyte /
and in them is a holownes wherein they receive such as they draw to them. In
each of them be. ii. entrees / through the one they draw ye wate ^y humor of
the vain Chyli / and also from the liver. Through the other they send and
vryn^ water to the bladder / and the kydnes be joined to the back and be fat
round about Behind the kydnes by the spo^dyles be the lymmes or nether rydge
bones there on restrynge as on a quylt / or matrys. Between yt kydnes passes ye
veins Chyli and A dorthi to the netherm^mmes / by the which veins very ny^he
grows the semynall vessellys.

Of the flanks and herpartyes Ca. viii.
Of the flanks ye shall und stand the nether part of ye belly from the lap
to the secret membrys / and be of. ui. manners / somholde / as myrach / Siphae
/ Sir bus / and the bonys / some be holden / as ye semy nall vessellys / the
mother or matrix in a woe man / the fu^dament gutt / the senowes and vay nes ye
comes downwarde. In every of them is a gryat bone / and they be ordained
together with a great spo^dyle named ossis sacris on the back side / and on the
for part making of ye genytour bone / named os pectinis. Thus these bonys go
abroad over both ye sides of ye lymmes of the hyppes / where through having in
the^ great holys does go both senowes / veins / and strings / they be also
but small by ye side of pectinis / by the secret members. In the myddest of
the^m yt nether part by the boxys or holownes / or pixides / wherein be
stryngys of ye bonys. Of the lymmes yt be holden is first ye bladder / and is
like a bag / where in is gadered the superflue water / or vryne / that comes
of the kydneys / and ye bladder is of. ^i. strong pa^nicles / and is roundand
great about the qua^tite of a pynte. In it be. ii. long ways named porri
vritides / coming from the kydneys a side half / berynge the vryne from ye
kydneys. The neck or pype of the bladder is flesshy with closing and
onclosynge lacertys or musculys / going from the bladder beudyd through the
myddys unto the yard of the man But in a woman without beudynge / the qua^tyte
of. ii. inches with there secret member / and through that is the vryne dryueth.

Of the grain or semynall vessellys. Ca. ix.
THe semynalle vessellys be in them self veins / that have their beginning
by the kydneys / of the veins of Chyli and Adorati / descendynge and be^^^ge
the blood to the coddes / both (...) man and woman / wherefore in the last^yon
the sede is named sperma / which is the sede of our humayne nanature. In a man
these vessellys be outwardys / for their coddys be without / and the women's
vessels be within / for their coddys or stonys be within / and by this may be
marked that this sede has the nature of the heart / the liver / and ye kydneys
and the brain / for this cause / for to make dilectacyon / the senowes com
from ye brains to the stonys / and also the hole body has fellowship therewith.
The matrix or mother is an acker of the generacyon of mankind / and an organ for
to conceyne / whose manner and posycyo^ or place is between ye bladder and
fu^dament / and is made of. ii. strong pannycles / and is round / and has
armis with coddys or stonys like ye pursse of ye coddis and has a thing like a
belly i^ ye myddyl and a neck holowe and small at the end like a ma^nys yard
that is crokyd / and has a cleft named vulua / and has aprepuciu^ or
covering like a ma^nys yard / and is of length. viii. or. ix. inches. And
though she has. ii. holownessys yt be openly known after the no^bre of her
brestys or pappis yet she has each divided in. iii. cellys or cha^bres / and
one in the myddys / and thus she has. vii. cellys or places of co^ceyuyng She
has also collygacyon with the brains / heart / liver / and the stomach / and
is bound to the back / between her and the brestys be joined to gydder the
milk and the menstruall veins. Therefore Ypocras says that the womans milk is
the brother of me^struum. And Galienus says therefore that the woman can nathaue
their costumable diseas of menstruum and give milk at one time. Under ye mother
is ye right fundament which is the keeper of the superfluyte of the first
dysgestyon / and is made of pa^nycles / and is of the length of a shaftment /
rechynge nygh to the kydneys / stretchynge in length nyghe to the romp bonys
and the undermost part of it is named the ars / and the ars gut has
collygacyo^ with the bladder / therefore in their sekenes they suffer with each
other. The mannys y^^^^ is a plowman of the nature of mankind / and is also a
way of the vryne / and is made of skyn^e / musclus / veins / senowes / and
gross stryngys / and it is plantyd upon the bone Pectinis / and ye bondys com
from the bone Sacris / or holy bone. In the yard be. ii. pryncypall ways or
pypes / the one for the sede / and the other for the vryn. The end of the
yard is named Ballanum and the hole is named mitra. The first ouergoynge
skin of the yard is prepucium / and the yard is commonly. viii. or. ix.
finger bread long / and must be of reasonable bygnes / according to the
quantyte of the matrix or mother. Permenium or Peritonium is the place between
the ars and the yard / the which is a seem that follows the line of the
yard. Inguina or lyskes be ye clynsers of ye liver / ordained in ye foldys of
the thyges. Nates be the buttockes / ordained upon ye bone semoris / and is
grofe lacertous flesh.

Of the shynnes / and great fete. Ca.. x.
THe great foot or the shynne bone contynueth of ye ioynte Scie / or the
thyghes / to the vttermoste part of the artycles. This great foot is divided
in. iii. ye first is ye thygh the other is the shynne. the third is the little
foot. When the veins be descendyd with branches from their beginning to the
last spondyle or backbone / tha^ be they divided in. ii. partys. The one goth
to the right bray or thyghe / and ye other to ye lift / and comme branche wise
down through the shynnes to the fete / and make. iiii. veins. The first is
named Sophena / of the innermest holownes of the anclewe. The secound /
Sciatica on the utter part of it. The third / Poplitica between the great too
and the other. The. iiii. is Renalis / between the little too and ye other.
These veins be let blood for diverse dyseases / for this cause there be in the
shynnes. iii^. great veins that ofte^tymes brings in great course of blood
with peril and Jeopardye Auice^. says yt the senowes of ye fete come from ye
fenowes of ye ha^dys / but they take their beginning from the last spondylle
of the kydneys / and the bone sacri. It is to be understand that by the form
or dysposycyon of musclus yt wou^des by the ioyntys be peryllous / and sore to
be feryd. The gross boundys come out through ye shyn^ys and be openly shewyde
from beneth by the knees and on the helys / and in the ioyntys of the artycles
/ the sole of the foot is all full of bounds.

Of the bonys in the great foot. Ca.. xi.
THe first that is named the thygh is a great mary bone / and round at both
the endys The uppermost roundues is named Uertebrum / and enters in ye broad
bonys of the hanches. The nether part toward ye knee has. ii. roundnessys /
which come in. ii. holownessys of the first shynne bone named Osfocile / and
thereon is a round broad bone named the worle bone or knee shyue / and so is the
knee full made. Tha^ weth the shynne bone / and therbe. ii. (...) named focilia
/ ye byggest (...) former side makyd the gaderynge of ^es / and comes down
from the kn^ onto ye foot / and makes the anclewe on the inner side. The other
on the utter side like wise desce^ dynge shyftynge her self to the foot by the
other focili bone / and makes ye vttermeste anclewe / and these. ii. shynne
bonys make between them both one holownes / where as the first bone of the
foot is received in. And in ye foot be. iii. acyes or gaderynge of bonis In ye
first acyes be. iii. bo^ys gadered together i^ one rowndnes. The first of these
iii. bonys is named Cahap / or Astralagus and is round onether side. In the up
permost roundnes is festyned in the holownes of focilium / and there has the
foot meuynge. In the other roundnes is festyned the holownes of the bone named
Nauicularis. Than followed incontinent upon the foot the bone named Cahab. The
bone Nauicularis is like a shypholow on both sides. In ye first holownes is
received the roundnes of the bone Cahap. In the other holownes comes the
roundnes and gaderynge of the bonys of the foot. Under these. ii. bonys is made
the hole bone and proporcyon of the hele / wherein is festynyd the hole foot /
and beryth outward behind for ye great bondis that be in it. Now vndstande
that after the bone Nauiculare is in contynent the second hepe of the bonys of
ye foot / wherein be. iii^. short bonys / of ye which the one is named
Grandinosum. These bonys be round according to the bone nauiculare / and be
round toward ye third hepe of the bonys. In the third hepe be v. bonys
long / and receyuynge the articles of the toes / which be also. v. in nombre
/ and each has. iii. bonys save ye great toe has but. ii. bonys. Thus there
be in the little ^te. xxvi. bonys. And in the hole great foot be. xxxviii.
bonys. Thus may a surgyon mark by this / how he should break dysmembre / and
join again togeder / and among all other the little foot is most dangerous
to dysmembre / and set again togeder / and the lyghtest is the knee / and the
myddelmost is in the thyghe. (...).

Here endyh the Anothomia of the body of a man / for to know ye cuttynge /
dysmembrynge and ioynynge again Here after follows the science and co^nyn^ of
Surgery




Of the helynge of small vuou^dis, Ca, xii.
AFter the declaracio^ that is made of the Anathomia / ye shall understand that
I will begyn^e by order the handworke of surgery / and first I will begyn^e
with the wou^des / that be hewydor betyn only through the skyn^e unto the
flesh / and how ye shall demeue your self to cure and hele them by the grace
of god. Compelle and join the lyppes of the wou^des togeder (...) your hand /
and lay towe thereto with the white of an egg / tempered with a little common
salt and bynd it according to the need. The wou^dyd joint must rest and be
holdyn still / for through rest it must be cured or else other accydentis will
put back your cure through effusyo^s or corrup cyo^s of blood / non^ other
curing is of need so that the wound be without pain and ye depth well
dysposyd / but if there be great pair in it / for that should be a tokyn that
the fas in the depth were hurt / or the pannycle that is between the flesh
and the bone which covers the bone. Mark the words of Guidonis that says
/ ye shall never begyn^e to hele a wou^d till all other ipedime^tis be first
voydyd from it / which to fallyngis or accidentis happen most in great woundis.

Of the stichyng^ or festenynge of great wou^dis in the flesh. ca. xiii.
When there come to ye any great wound / that is not only through the skyn^e /
but also through ye flesh unto ye bone / without and to fallyngis or
accide^tis. Than shyft the lyppes of it togeder proply and clean / and tha^
festyne them according to their need. which festenynge may happen in diverse
manners whereof I will writ the most common. If the wound be than so great that
that byndynge only ware not enough for it. Or if ye wound were over twhart a
hole (...) / and that the lyppys of the wound drew ^de a sonder / and might
not be bound togeder. Than shyfte ye lyppys or vpperparte of the wou^dis
togeder / and beware there come no manner of onclennes of dust / here / oil /
nor non^ other thing that the gadered helynge thereby might be let. Than take a
iii. square nedyll as the skyn^ers occopy / and se that the nedyll be holowe
graven out about theiye / so that ye threde that shall go therein may lay flat
in ye holownes. The threde shall also be twyned togeder without any knottys and
waxed wherewith ye shall festyne / and the feste / nynge is in. v. manners. First
the common festenynge as to the foresaid belongs / is that ye shall set the
first stiche in ye myddis of the woundys lyppys / the other a finger broad
between every. ii. stiches / and so to the end till there be stiches enough /
but begyne never at the end / thentent that the wound may be ye purer
festenyd ^out any fro^cys. Therefore ye stiches shall be always add wha^ther
behooves more tha^ twain Also ye shall understand wha^ ye wound is deep and
ouertwhart / than must ye styches be ye deper festenyd for. ij. manner of causes
/ the first is because that it should breast out ye less. the second it should
matter the less / and because yt should be the less holownes underneath. Ye
shall not need to feste^ it deep if ye wound be of length. And wha^ ye have
festenyd ye wound / se that ye over cast your threde twyse or ye knet the knot
/ for else it would breast out again or ye cowde knet it / as I have seen
oftyn of vnlernyd surgeons / but ever keep your finger upon it till it be fast
knet that ye be not deceived with one knot / but wha^ it is ouercast as before
is said / ye need not to fere the yeopardy. And when that ye have done as I
have let nydin the stychynge as before is said / tha^ do after my co^soll and
folewe these noble lernyd men and surgeons / as La^francus / Guido / Guilhelm?
/ Place^ti^ de saliceto / do their commandment and fail not to bear upon you
this powder. A Powder. made of white franckencence. ij. partys / dragons blood.
i. part / and one third ^te of lyme made of egg shellrs / and make all these
in one powder and temperit with ye white of an egg / and lay that on ye wound
with tawe / though it have not be^ vsyd till this time but with the white of
anegge and salt. But this fornamyd powder is much better and profitable. and
this is the first manner for to stiche ye wou^dis. The second manner is to sow
over hand as ye skyn^ers do / and that fortuneth in ye bowels or sypha^ and
that is the call that keep the bowels each by other. The third manner is for to
put the nedyll through both the lyppys of the wound / and let the nedyll bide
therein stic king / and than take the threde and wynd it about both the endis
of the ne^yll. vi. or vii. times / and let it bide so still as long as it
nedis / as it fortuneth in wide or large woundis. The fourth manner is that
sometime a stychynge or festynynge happens for to stau^che blood / and that is
when ye se a vain blede sore / as the vain of the neck / or ye vou^ded
betynge vain / thrust that vain through with the nedyll / and after the
nedyll / knet the vain fast with ye threde that is in the nedyll / and than
draw the nedyll through / and let an end of the threde bide ha^gynge at it a
certain days till that upper part of the vain does putrifye / and that ye
thread go out by him self. The. v. manner hapeneth in the face / or in such
place as would not be seen / and also in tender people that were not able to
suffer the fornamyd stychynges / and eke in great wou^dis that have ye lyppis
wide a sou^der and thus if shall be ordered. Take little lynnen cloutys three
square and spread them (...) this salve / made of draga^tu^ / dragons blood /
Olibanu^ / Masticis / Sarcocolle / of each one dragma. Myldust out of the myll
three dragmas. The white of an egg so much till it be ynowgh. Than lay upon
every side of the wound the pecys eueriche of them an ynche from other. And
when ye cloutis be well dry / tha^ sow them or styche them togeder. Thus
endyth th is chaptuor of the stichynge or festynge of ye small or simple
wou^dis / that be chanced in the skyn^e / or in the flesihe.



Of the woundys in senowes. ca. xiiii.
First it is to be regardyd whether the wound be in ye length of the senowe or
in the bread. Or that it is only a prycke with a nedyll / an all / thorn / bod^
kynor any such like. Or that the senowe is over twharthewed clean of / or cut.
Or that it be cut through ye length. Nota when the senowe is hurt with a foyne
/ than is the wound close. than it is need to make the wound wyder and put
therein oil of rosys made with on^ype oil oylue / wermer tha^ he may well
suffer it. so long till the wound be full. furthermore yt shall be laid to
the wound fyn turpe^tyne that is pure / white / and well washed between. ij.
clothes. and ye wound and lym^e about it

A Salve.
and shall be enoynted with that warm oil of rosys temperyd with bolo armeno
that it may be some what thycke. and thereupon shall be laid a soste lyn^en
clothe yt has beu wet before in good warm white wine / and tha^ bind it up
softely. And if the pain do not ceas with this at the syrst / than do it oftyn
yt it ceas for there is no better way / though ye pain vanysh not incontinent.
This does Lanfrancke testefy / and many other noble surgeons. But if the pain
contyne we to long / than it is good be my counsel for to take oleum rosa^ /
boli armeni and opium thebaicum a little / and made warm / and occopyed in the
fornamyd manner. And the pacyent shall rest and meue but little / and keep him
self from anger. And wha^ne the pain does ceas / and the wound draw to ye
draught / Than hele it with the grene wound salve and wound drink / the
which I will show you herafter in ye antithodari^ Nota / if ye senowe or ye
vain be hewyd / or cut a so^der / tha^ festyn ye vain or senowe in such
manner as the lyppes of ye wou^des be festenyd if that ye can get the vain with
wound / and upon the vain and wound ye shall lay oil of roses made with grene
oil olyue where as ye little ground wormys be sodt in / and how ye shall
sethe them ye shall know in the Antithodario / and that shall ye use. ij. or.
iij. days / and on the. iiij. day take the foresaid powder that is showed in
the. xiij. chapter of the festenynge of ye wou^dis made in this manner. Of white
franke^cence etc. but it were very vtyle and profitable to put among it the
powder of dried worms before named / and dried to the uttermost without
bre^nynge. But the dryenge that naturally behouyth to the wou^dis of senowes
and veins as Lanfrancus / Guido / and Rogerius testefye / is vnguentum de
vermibus / made in this manner.

A Salfe
Take little Centaurea Lingua canina herba / consolidamator / consolidamedia /
an hafull of each / a pownde of grene oil olyue ground worms half a li.
whytt wine half. li. stamp all these togeder and let it stand stepynge in
himself. vii. days / and than ye shall stamp with it. ij. li. of shepis
talowe / black pytche and rosyn / a quarter of each. Armoniaci / Galbani /
appoponati / meltyd in vinegre. v. dragmas of each / and sethe all these
togeder till the wine and vinegre be consumed / than strain it / and wha^ it
is almost cold / than put to them half a quarter of turpentyn / frankencence
/ mastic / sarcocolle. iij. dragmas of each. ij. drag mas of saffran / and take
a spatula and styrie all these togeder / and thus make this salve for it is
very precyo^ i^ necessite. Roger? does put to this millefolin^ / but
La^fcancus commands yt ye shall keep ye wound moist first. ij. or. iii.
days with oil of rose and ground worms when the wound is festenyd. This
ointment following thou ought for to have always by ye for to anoint about the
woundis / for all co^nynge surgeons use it for to defend all fresshe woundis.

A deffencyfe salfe.
And the deffencyf is made in this manner. Take. iiii. ounces of oliu^ Rosaru^.
ii. ounces of boli armeni / terra sigillata / asceti / of each of them an ounce
/ canfer one dragma / night schae / house leke / of each an handful. Of all
these ye shall make a fine oynt me^t in a mortyr / for through these for said
festenynge of the senowes / and through ye oil / powder and ointment / the
lym^e is preseruyd helyd / and rectifyeth. Also ye shall not be to sore
abasihyd of the pain that co^myth of the pryckynge of the nedyll / for ye pain
is swetnyd again with the oil of Rosys when it has been anointed there with
iii. or. iiii. times. But if the pain do not seas / that is a tokyn of the
crampe or a cut tynge of the senowe* Now may ye re^ue me of that I said before
/ that the oil was a deffendour of the helyng of the wou^dis / because I
doco^maunde here to put warm Rose oil in the wound / and also abuut it. But
to this I answer / Though Galienes says that the wounds ought to be taken
head of yt there come no here / nor oil / nor other fylthenes / Therefore I say
that ye oil of rosys must be made of grene or on type oil olyue yt seems
more a ioyst or lycour than oil / and of the ground worm the oil receives
a conglu^^nacyon. Ye shall never begin to hele up the wou^detyll ye pain be
passyd and gone / sor if ye hele it up or the pain be passyd and gone / it is
to be feared that an i^^ os^ume and swellynge with great hete / shall stryke to
ye wound / and of that to falling it fortuneth so^ time the loss of a lymme
or death. The surgeon may do no better for ye ease of the dyseasyd pson / but
to keep the wounded lym^e from swellynge with great hete as it is before said Is
that the wound done not hele with ye for said oil and powder / and that ye
wound dydonclose and began to matter or come to draught / than shall ye hele
the wound with the grene wou^dis salve which I will set in the antithotarius /
and that salve shall be stryked upon a lynen clothe and laid to ye wound at
mourn and at night / and in the nedermost end of the wound / ye shall put a
little tent / yt the senowes be not meuyd or touched that there come no pain
of it. If that there were of yt matter to great a supsluyte than make this
salve following / the which does not only purifye the wou^dis of the senowes /
but also all manner of wou^des / though it were in a deep holowe wound / which
salve shall be made in this manner. Take strayned rosehony. vi. ou^cis fine
boultyd barley flower. ii. ouncis / temp these togeder and sethe them / but look
that bren^e not. And when ye have set it from ye fire / stere it well with a
spatulum and put thereto. ii. ouncis of white turpentyne* or if ye find no^
white / than wasshe it in cold water till it be whyt / but for that common
water I have taken one of these water that I could get best / as Sanicle water
/ small planteyn water / consolida minor water / sidou wat rose wat. and wha^
ye wou^d lenyth of matterynge and will dry / A salve. Tha^ ta^ke of ye
forenamyd salve. iiii. ou^cis whyt frankencens dragons blood / mastic /
sarcocolle / a dragma of each / temper them all togeder / and lay it to the
wound as be fore is said. till it be hole / and always lay above the wound /
tow / stepyd in strong whyt wine / well warm / and that defe^dyth the won^de
from all accedentis / pain swel lynge and hete / specially wha^ in the wine is
sodyn Consolida mayor mouseer with ye gelow flowers / and sent John^s wort with
the brodleuys. If the common veins ve hurt that be named vene or arteria
whihe be the betynge veins / They may so sore hurt that they shall never be
helyd trwly / as some doctors say / But that fortuneth whan^e they be wou^dyd
ouertwhart / But and they be hurt in length / they may be helyd truly / as it
is opynly enough known by the veins yt belet blood / which be helyd in few
days without dryenge powders. But to hele the wou^dyd veins is done with the
for namyde powder that is made of the dried ground wormys named Lombrici / and
that laid in the woundr / and the forsayde rose oil soden with the ground
worcester mys laid warm upon it with cotton. Hereof I have had much profit / and
also seen it of many good masters / though yt some say that ye wormys should
be brent to powder / but it is nothing so / but they shall be dried in an ouyn
where as ye bread is drawn out of till ye may braye them to powder / For wha^
they be brent to powder they lose their strenght of their co^glutina cyon or
gaderynge togeder of flesh / But they gader ye skyn^e to sone toge^ / ye
which to ye grieved senowes is no need. This fortuneth also in ye salve
aforsayd of the said worms / as La^cfra^cus and Guido testefied.

Tostaunce blood in the woundyd veins. Ca. xv
IF it fortuneth yt vene capillares / which be the smallest veins / or vene
maiorum / which be the great blood veins / or ar terie / that be the betyng
veins were hurt / and did blede sore / tha^ne is it needful that ye behold
the manner of the woundyd man / the complexcyon / the age / and the strength of
youth / specially ye must mark if he have much blood in his body / than let
enough go out of it / if ye be called thereto betyme. But if ye come not intyme
by him / so that he through fawte of blood should become faint and feeble / tha^
mark if ye blood come from venis capillarives / for they be veins as small
as here / if it so do / tha^ after ye stitchynge of ye wound / it is s^ffycy
ent to lay to it / the white of an egg with towe and with the powder before
named / for that powder stauncheth blood and co^gluti nesh the lyppys of ye
wound togeder. Wha^ the blood comes from the great vain named vena matoru^
/ tha^ne it co^myth slowly forth / and it is groce / and enclyneth him to a
purpre color / blackysshe / and wha^ it is not stau^ched / it is dedly / for
the blood is ye tresour of the life. And Auice^na writes that if ye wou^dyd
person have any of these chau^ ches / that is to say Spasmus which is ye
crampe / or Cincopis that is the swowyng it is a suspecte tokyn or sign / Also
wha^ ye blood comes from the artery / which is the betyng vain / ye shall
know it by this tokyn / for the blood commyth spryngynge out / like as the
vain closyth and open^* If it be not staunchyd lyghtely / the woun did parson
bledyth him self to death. Therefore it is not enough always to use the fornamyd
staunchynge of blood. But this vein behooves a mighty strong stau^chyng of
blood / and yt may be done in. ii. manners. Therefore we can not vndsta^de yt ye
blood of ye wound ca^ be stau^chyd only with the drynes yt be laid to ye wound
as it is before said. But ye shall have therefore a rule / where with the cowrs of ye
blood may be helped and stoppyd / and yt in many sundry ways / sometime it
fortuneth that it will be helped with byndynge of the contrary side over
against yt woundyd place sometime with rubbing / sometime with lettynge blodr in
another place / sometime with boxinge / sometime with ymagynacyo^ / that she
wou^dyd parson does ymagyne or think that he bledid no more. The second rule or
manner is how ye shall use the utter more dryenge / named the localia / and how
it should be laid upon the wound and vain / and this is of diverse manners
occupied and ruled / sometime with noise that causes one to sterte for fere
that the blood ro^neth or congelyth / or the dryenge be laid to it / sometime it
dries with fasting of the vain with the nedyllor the trede / sometime with
bre^nynge and with other ways as ye shall here. when ye have dressyd a wound
with the drink substances before named / and that it will not stau^che / than it
is necessary for to remedy the cowrs of ye bledynge / in this manner / ye shall
bind and rub the contrary part as if the right hand did blede / than ye
should rub the lift arm well up and down / and after that rubbing bynd it
with a woollen selue ege of clothe to tentent that the blood may ro^ne to socour
the place that is so fore bound because that the other place so bledyng may
stau^che / but not sully / for if it were hole stoppyd / the lym^e or place
might ware styffe and lose his felyng and be as deed. And thus may ye do from
ye lift hand to the right / and from ye right side of the heed to the lift
foot / and in ye same manner may be done with boxyng and fleemynge / also with
closing of the wou^dyd parson or with setting at wyndow and his heed
outwardis that he se no manner of read / and say always to him that he bledyth
no more / than ye did fleem him or let him blood for his health. And thus is ye
natural strength enforcid / and blood stau^ched through the contrary
ymagynacyon / and this is ye first manner for to stau^che ye flode of bledig The
other manner or rule is how ye ought to order your pacyent in the localia / that
is in the laynge on of the dryinge substance or syccatyf without with the hand.
And this is done in many manners. Galienes in qui to terape^ti / Lanfrancus of
myllayne / Gui do / conclude all togeder that in the cour^ of the blood which
can not be stau^ched with the for said mysterijs / than lay your finger softh
upon the mouth of the wound of the vain / holding it still till ye blood do
ro^ne or gely / or ye lay any drynes or syccatyf to it. The other manner or rule
is yt ye shall have always by your powder that of their own nature does
stau^che or restrain the blood / and that the powder have in him self such
strength that when it towcheth the vain / that it therewith may close / which
strength is named stiptica / and that causes also the flesh to grow.
Another manner following / is that if ye cane get ye vain by the end and
festene it / as it is showed before in the. xiii. chaptre. Another manner to
bre^ne the end of the vain that it may have an estra which is a skurffe or
shrynk^ ge togeder / and that is in. ii. manner of ways. The syrst is done with
sharp drye^ges or cy catyffes / as with vitriole / bre^t or onbre^t / or else with
vnslycked lym^e. The second with a bre^ninge yro^ or gold which belongs to
ye vain / as says Aui. The hot cauteriu^ shall be done in this manner with a hot
bre^nyn ge yro^ and yt it be deep to the^tent it may make a gros estra^ or
skurffe / whose offallyng be natheuy. The cauterys or yro^s yt ye bre^ne with be
figured here underneath / and ye need no more instrume^tis than here be figured /
for over many does trouble.



Theodorices prayseth Arcenicu^ sublimaticum with such bre^nynge / for that
stops all great flode of ye blood / and also it makes alo^ge during estram
or scurffe. Another is that ye must lay that lym^e right that it hang not as
nere as it is possible. Also if it has bled much before / take it not of in
iii. or four days till ye vain be somewhat helyd. And take your bynding is of
wisely and not rechelessy lest ye hurt the vain and cause it to bre^ne upon a
fresshe. If that ye syccatyffes or byndynges be taken to it / tha^ ye shall lay
wete things to it an howr of twain because ye should not hurt your pacyent /
nor trowble your self / and ye must do it thus / take the white of an egg /
and vile of Roses well betyn togeder / and lay yt to it / or else take a fair
lyn^en clowte and deep it in wine and lay that to it. Another manner of dryeng
as this / ye shall lay your finger upon the mouth of the vain till the blood
besomwhat run that it be thycke / and than must ye have a powder

A siccatyf powder
Made of pure whyt fra^ckencens. ii. partis and Aloepaticum. i. part / temper
this powder with the white of an egg as thycke as honey / and deep therein white
haers hee^ yt is cut small and lay that to the wound or vain / for that does
not only stau^che the blood / but yt helyth also the arteries / as Lanfrancus
of melan has often times prouyd / as he writes in the chapter of ye
staunchynge of wounds / that a child of iii. year old having a knyf in his
hand / and sell upon it and so hurt him self in ye throat / and unawares he
com by the child which all ready had lost his sight / and the blood did ro^ne
white out of veins / and his puwlce did beat but fayntly / and he laid
incontynente his finger upon the mowthe of the wound that there might no more
yssowe out the wound / and with in alystonde the nature was reconfortith / and
ye poulce began to beat again / and the iyen began^ to opyn / than did he
lay the fornamyd powder upon the wound / and upon that he did lay tow depyd
in ye white of an egg / and he commaundyd to give ye child a morssell of bred
stepyd in water / and the next day the child was well strengthyd / yet he
unbound not the bound till the fourth day after / and on the. iiii. day
the drynes or cyccatyf was so hard backe^ there to / that he cowde not well
get it of. Tha^ he did lay to it the white of an egg and oil of rosis betyn
togeder as before is said and did let it lay upon it till the next day and
than was the wound clean hole / whereof all the people therabout had great
meruell. If the blood will not staunche with such cyccatyffes through any
accydentys or tofallynges / tha^ must ye work with such sharp ferynges or
brennyngys as is before specyfyed. Also another stau^chyng takyn by the
instruccyo^ of Auicenna / A cyccatyf powder Take onquenchyd lyme / drago^s
blood aloes succotrini / of each a like much / and thereof a powder made / and
vsyd as ye other before. If ye will have another that dries and resteyneth
more.

A powder.
Take a great gall apple / drage^s blood voly armeni / fra^ke^ce^ce /
aloepatic^ / mastie of all these a like much / and thereof a powder made / and
to it / put the guarter of as much whyt harys here that is cut small and
that occupied in the for said manner. Another powder that Rogerius / and
Jamerius vsyd / ye which does not only stau^ the blood but also it does dry
and hele.

A Powder.
Take grek is pytche. vi. ounces / boli armeni. iii. ounces mastic / drago^s
blod / and olibanian ounce of each / ye rote of co^solida mayor / roses of each
an half ounce / of all these make a fine powder / and use it as before is she
wy^ After this I will show you of many and diverse powders at more layser in ye
Antithodarius. Of all the staunchyngys of blood thateuer I se / I never saw
none better than one stone that is brought out of spain or galisce not far
from ye way to saint Jamys which I vsyd / and as soon as I towched the mowthe
of the wound or vain / it staunchyd and closyd / butt I took also of ye same
stone puluerysed and strewed that powder round about it in the mean season
that ye stone was in it / and when I would occopy it again / tha^dyd I pullys
she the stone (...) of ye old blood (...) it was fres^he again. and also. ij.
pertys of this pow^ myxed among one part of the other and so vsyd has done
me great pleasure at my most ^e and is very profitable / this stone is somewhat
palewhyt / and has sometime in it small read veins / and is named of ye
pelgrymes the blood stone / but it is not the stone Jaspis nor Ematites / and
when the blood is so staunchyde / the wound helyth as before is specyfyed.

Of the wounds where thornys sple^tys / or such like be in. Ca xvi.
IF now there were no vain hurt nor no flode or course of blood / and that
there were between the pertys of ye wound a piece of a bone / a piece of ye
arowe / thorn / a splynter / and that the wound were to narow. Tha^ it is
need for you to cut or make the mowthe of it more wyder / and that in two
manners. The first with a tente made with ye rote of gencyane / or pyth of el^
or of a we^e piece of a spo^ge bound hard (...) a threde and dried upon an iron
/ and tha^ the threde taken of again / and here of make tentys / one smaller
than another / and occopy them till ye have made the wound as bygge as need
requires / or as ye desire.



The second manner is / that ye shall cut the wound wyder with a pair of
cysars or with sheres there to belonging / as here is fygured / but that is
dreadful to the wou did person^ counsel for But if those ca^ nateas / and yt
ye diseasyd person ca^ not for great feer abide ye cuttyng / Tha^ must ye make
this sleep drink and give it him to drynk / whereof he shall (...) in sleep and
feel another cuttynge nor pain / and thus must y^ make it.

A sleep drink.
Take ye rote of Solatru^ mortale / and semen i^s^ami of each an ounce / white
popy sede / and blak popy sede / opiu^ the baicu^ adragma / croci orie^talis /
corticis ma^dragora / lignu^ aloes / Cinamomi / Castoriu^ / a dragma of each.
And of all these make a course powder / and of this powder take. ij. dragmas
and i^ ^e it with maluesye / and give it him at a draght. And wha^ he is in
sleep than cut up the wo^u^de as much as nedyth till it be wide (...). Tha^
draw out such thing as is in it with thy fyngers or with nipers. In the same
manner go^ne stonys / with nypers or pynsons and other instrumentis as here after
is more plainly expressyd / And wha^ thou wylt have him wakend again tha^ put
a piece of a sponge in his nose / that has been wet in vine gre or in ye Joyst
of Rewe or fenell / and there with all he wakeneth again. So^me give him Opiu^
alone without any other thing therein tempered / but beware thereof / for so^me
become frantycke or made thereof / thus it is very dangerous. If that the
wou^dis were made wide with the tentis or with the cuttynge and that they were
not wide enough / and that ye durst make it no wyder with cuttig through fear of
death / or lesynge of a ^oynte / than put into the wound this instrument
balista yt is here fygured / wherwt ye shall enlarge it / and than ye may put
your Instrument into the wound and take out that is in it.

Of (...) ^is shot with poisoned (...) he dis and other thyngis ca. xvii.


When any pacyent comes to you / this is my counsel that ye demand of him
/ how and in what manner this chance did fortune him / in what manner and
form that this is shote or other wise come to him / as of ye things yt
therein be remained / like glass / iron / thor^e / arow head / or other diverse
things / so^me be right / sum crooked / so^me round / so^me hoked / sum
square / so^me triangled / so^me holowed where timber has been in / sum
venymed / and so^me not venymed. Some stycke fast in the flesh / and some in
the bone / and some so deep in the body that it go the almost through both the
sides. And wha^ ye be well assured of these / than it is need yt ye have some
instrument in your besynes be longing to this work. Of the which ye first be
tongues or nypers / half moan wise and inwardly tothed.



The other be ryhgt terebellys sharp before / like as ye se fygured and
counterfayted here benythe / when the head of the arow is broken of / thanne ye
may perce with your instrument in the timber softely and so draw it out.



The other be nypers or pynsons / named Albucasys / and is formed like the byll
or nebbe of a storke wtin dentyd tethe which is fygured as it is shewyde by
this instrument that stondyth here benethe between ye other. ii.

The other be tongues or nypers that be broad / indentyd and holowe as che nebbe
/ for to take out a gone stone / like as here stondyth benethe on the other
side.

The other be terebellys yt be viced going in a pipe / like as it sto^dith
fygured here be nethe on ye one side / and it is for to take an arow head out
wha^ the wode is out of it.



THe manner in such cause to work is this. Thou shall mark ye tokens of life
or death or ye shall begin^e to work yfye se any toke^ of death / tha^ take
nothige out of the body at that time for fere of death before he has taken his
sacrament. The first toke^ / as when the shot is in the heed brain / so
suffer the pacyent great pain whereby the s^ome avoid out of the mouth and at
the wound. That other token / as the shot is in the heart / so commyth there
out black blood. The third token / as the shot is in the loungis / than there
comes sco^mynge blood out. The. iiii. token / as the paciente is towchyd in
the mawe / than gothe his meet vndisgest out. The. v. token / as the pacie^t is
towchyd in his guttis so he auoydyd his tordre out. The. vi. token. as the
pacient is towchyd in his bladder / so he avoid out his water / and that is a
sign of death / And in all other places there the pacient is hurt / there as
the sign of death is not pull out of the wound that shot / as I shall learn
you. and than heel it as another wound. And that shot shall be taken out in
sundry manners. And there is iii. principal manners of takenout. The first that
must be taken out with tongys and instrume^tis. The. ii. that with might is
smyten through coming out on ye other side. The. iii. is / as the shot will
not come out / or may not be draw out without more harm / and you may not
make the wound greter with cuttynge or with tentys. So let the wound certain
days putrifye / so co^myth the shot better out / Nevertheless it must be
handeled softly / and there upon ley the plaster drawyng to the sore / as I
shall learn you If it be so that an arow is poisoned / if any body is shoten
with a gonne / so do as I shall learn you. ye which drawn with plasters it will
not be well done with out the wound be wyder made with cuttynge or with tentys.
Also says Henricus that it may be hastly drawn out. And so says Auicenna /
Albucasis / and Brunus. And there after may ye heel the wound as ye will
heel an other wound / No more there to do than the superfluence blood which is
beco^me to matter in the wound / that it be clensyd. If ye be in fear of
coming more pain / so may ye put in the wound hot oil often times. And as
ye will begyn^e to work / and ye have knowledge whether it be an arowe / or a
gonne pylleth / or another thing. And if the shot is in ye heed with any other
dyseas or to falling / so draw the arowe out craftily with a pyle tongge like
as here to fore the pyctor or figure shows. Is any body shot in the arm or
leg / and the tymbre be from the iron / so cut that other side against the
wound / and draw out that iron. If he be shot in his body and the tymbre be
out of his body from the iron / thanne must you ^erche the iron with a tongue
or a small instrument of iron where that it is / Than draw it proprely out /
If ye wound be to narrow than may ye do as is aforesaid with tentys or cuttyng
/ If he may suffer it wakyng or slepynge / and so draw it out with your
instrument / If it may not so be / ley there upon a plaster / and give the
pacyent a drink as I shall learn you in this chaptre / and also in
Anthidotario The pacient shall lie opon ye wound as he may best suffer /
because that ye said drynk and plaster may the better draw out the iron / And
as ye may perceive ye yro^ / draw it out. Never shall you pull out ye shaft
from the iron as one is shot with an arrow. If the shaft be shot deep in the
body / in the plu^ king out of the arrow ye leese the iron of the arrow so
that ye can not find it. So it was be happened king Mathyse of hu^gri was
shotten with an arrow in ana^me the timber came out / and ye y^on cowde not be
found / The said king pro^ysyd who that cowde get out that iron without harm
doing he would give them great good. Tha^ came to him hans dockenborth and
dressed ye wound there he was shotten in / and band him so that there came no
matter out from the wound in many days / and leyd upward above ye wound an
defensyfe a cold plaster

An defensyfe.
Made of bolo armeno / vynegre / camfere / a little roose oil / and ye white
of an egg myxed and made as thycke as honey / because ye arm should not festre
in fire / by reason of the byndynge caused to gadder the matter about the iron
in the wound / and so the skyn^e swellyd / where by the iron came / there cut he
the skyn^e and took out the yro^ without any tongue. Than the king made him
knight and an earl. Wherefore ye masters remember upon it as ye can not find ye
iron / or yt it be in a such place that ye may not cut. yfit be in arm or
leg / Is the timber be goo out and ye iron is bide within / put therein that
instrument called a terebell in apype / and shrouyd upward and pull that iron
out. If yt may not be done so / make the wound wide with tenttys / or with
cuttynge / and so may ye pull it out. But first put in the wound that
instrumente called Balista / and there after the terebelle / because it shall to
softer goo in. And if that iron will not come out lyghtely when ye begyn^e to
pull tha^ prove it with the pyll tongue / and as ye have the iron with the tongue
/ and it will not come following / like as it happenyth in the borgo^nysshe
fylde before Bloumou^de that a man was shotten with an arowe / the iron bide in
the body and the tymbre was out / To the which was many surgeo^ called for
help to have the yro^ out / and it would not follow / than came there to a
surgeon of Straesborowe called Hans mayere / and he took the pyltonge in his
hand / and he per ceyuyd that the iron was hoked cross wys and he turned the
iron with the tongue about so that the crossyd iron came to ye same place as it
went in / inco^tynent came the yro^ out / where by he was sore praysyd / and yet
cowde no person tell how he had it out.

If it be also that it is not possible so to do with that pulling out. And if it
be al most through going unto the further side / like yt happen the arowe to
stytche in the leg and the tymbre is still in it / than sin yte the arow
through it / and pull it out on ye other side. And if the tymbre be out than
stryke ye yro^ with another arowe through. and so must ye do like wise if such a
case of an arowe happen in ye body / and yt is more peryllous And if an iron
ware sounke deep in the body of a man / that it were not possible to take it
out with pyle to^gis nor with plasters nor with tentis / nor with cuttyngis
where as it went in / nor unto the other side with outfere / so long let that
iron styke unto ye time that the natour will drive him out to appear. Albucasis
writes of many personis that arow heedis and gone pylleth that remain in the
body / and has worn it many a day without harm. There has been seen in
wertenborw a Taylour that had an nedyll in his back berynge more than. xx.
winter or it was cut there of /

Of the drynes ye which pull out / thorns / splyntis / glass / bonis / and
pyces of bonys / has Guido made one drynes / taken out of Auicenna / and is
made in this manner / And all this per^ellis that is in ye book that ye
understand not / ye shall find it in the pottycarris to sell.

A cicatyffe powder.
Take whete me le and honey and the fulness of a be heue of each a po^de weght /
and of byrd lyme take. viii. ou^cis / and oil olyue viii. ou^cis / armoniacum.
iiii. ou^cis / and make thereof a salve / and use it like aforsayd is.

Salve
Make this following salve yt to him pullyth al manner of yro^ that bydeth in
man's body. Take apostomaticu^ Nicolay. iiii. ou^cys. Magnete stone which
comes from ^^iente. ii. oncys. and and yelow Iye front / and Polipodium /
dyptami albi / of each a half ounce. hare grese. ii. ou^c. oil of hempsede ane
once / turpantyn a half ounce / of all this make a plaster and lay it on the
wound. Ite^ Rogerius said that he has prouyd / ye rote of a reed stampyd with
honey and laid it to the wound / that pulle out all that is bonys / stonys /
glass / without any pain. Is the wound to narrow so make it wyd with cuttynge
or with tentys as I have before said. If that may not be done / so let the
wound in him self type with ye maturatyse / than it comes out of ye wound
with ye matter / and than cleanses the wound / and if it be need do as is before
said. Item here I will learn you a marvelous mixture of many virtues / for it
will suck and draw out all rotten bonys / thornys / and other like things.

A salve
Take the kyrnels of a date tree Surach rubei / sal armoniacum / long hole
root or astrologia longa / and radicis cucumeris / asinini / terpentyn of
each. v. dragnes. and black peper and white peper and armoniaci amoni /
phylobalsa^^ / tu^is masculi / colofonie / / more tresap / of each two dragnes
and a half / and wax. iiii. dragnes and ye dreggis of the oil of white
lyllyes as much as ye need, and of all these make a salve / and ley it upon
the wound / and it is very good to set on the wound a bore without pryckynge.

Of wou^dis that be shot with poyseneth arrow hedis and many other things. Ca.
xvii.
A Man shotien with a poisoned arrow or any other wepe^. and you have taken out
the arrowe in such manner and form as is before written. For yt which venym shot
the same person has great harm that the same venyme comes from one ioynte
to another, for fault of taking head betyme. I iheronymus brou^swyk born in
strae soorow have seen one was bytte^ in his thombe which he would a reested /
and he had etyn in ye night some what / having in mind that day to poison
arrows and other wepe^s / and as he would a reested that man he cast him on
the ground and so came his thombe in ye ma^nys mouth and he booted the thome
and would not leave his bythynge unto to the time his mouth was full of blood /
whereby he was almoost choked with the said blood / tha^ he opened his mouth
and let him goo / and said he had enough to save his life / for as much as
the thome was so fore it must be cut of / and after that was ye hand cut of /
and after that was cut of the arm / and ye body was swolle^ so byg that they
cowde skante save his life. therefore it is need to take heed with the first to
give him tryacle magna one dragne meddled with wine / therein must be soden
tormentyll dyptan and master root and rue water as much as is ye wine each an
ounce. And that shall be given him at every. xxiiii. ouris. In ye wound there as
the arrow is pulled out / put warm violet oil made of lynneseed oil / and in
ye same wound shall ye put a tent deep in the said oil / and that will draw
out the venym / and put the same oil to the salve wherwt ye will heel ye
wound. and do in like wise to them yt is shot with a go^ne / for that takes ^ut
the ^e^y^^ and that fire / and brings the wou^det^ fair matter into helynge.

An Oil.
Take lyn sede oil one pound / (...) an ounce of camfer / and temper it
together / and the ^he^ of a little warmyd / and deep therina tent and put thau
in the wound the ^yle and the tente / and thereupon le^^ a grene wounded pla

ALso as any body is shotten with a gone where as ye pyl let is taken out of ye

about all sides of the wound / and there with shall ye draw out that venym of
the powder that is in ye wound. And than will there no matter come out. tha^
make a tente of bako^ / and stryke a little there with of eer wax / and that
shall draw out ye venym of the wound and of the a^^ow / and to bring the
wound to matter. Thant, ^^ll ye wound with good salve.

Of crusshed wounds. Ca. xix.
THrse wounds happens by inyght of falling / or that the one the other
pusshyth / su the wound happens also with (...) thing that is not sharp and
not cuttynge / and not pryckynge / as a clobbs / or a stat / or a crooked sta^ /
or that one falls from heyth / and in all such like case. Therefore these
wounds be indyfferente from the wounds cuttynge with swords or daggers / or
with other sharp wepens that cutteth or prycketh / or stytchyd. And also to
this before said woun des behooves another cure / for to this wou^ des as they
be fresihe we behoue one co^glutinaturu^ / is as much to say as lymyng to
gydder. Mundificatiuum / is to say clensynge if it be need. Therewith
Consolidati number / that is the wound to heel. But it is never good helyng
without fair clensyng In this brusshed wounds is not to do such a cure /
for in ye crusshed wounds is (...) flesh brusyd and the corpora of the vay
nes and synewes. Also it fortuned sometime that ye brusynge happeth without
wound that is sometime in the flesh / sometime in the synewes / and sometime
within the best of ye body. Of this before said will I not write / than only of
the brusynge that hap peneth with wounds. Item If there co^ meth a fore you
such a wound in the fles she / and ye will begin to work with co^solidaty^
/ ye must look on the complexyo^ of the person / and of his age / young or
oldr / or lene of body / or full of blood or mo^ (...) nes / so must you let
him blood on the va^ ne on ye contrary side / which takyth (...) (...) the
matter that would grow to an (...) me. And if the complexyon of the pe^ (...)
de weke or feeble / and old / or lytty^^ of blood / so behooves him not to be
lett^ blood. The place of the body must be defen did of the coming of
yl^accyde^tys of an unpostume / and to flode of the blood / and that shall be
done with warm oil of roses strykynge often there with about (...) wound and
there upon straw the powder of (...) berrys of myrtylle. And as the wound^
begin to give matter so is need to clen se it with ye yelke of eggys / and
with oil of ^ofes / be tyn to gydder / and so lay it an aly^ne clothe and
lay it on ye wound / and there upon lay a mundificatiuum of rose honey / ^^rly
meel and alytell whytte beten turpa^^yn / and that must be done so often unto
the time it rot^yd and the matter and ye brusynge may co^^ ^^esshe / and there
after do the flesh growing as it is need. And if the brusyd place be full of

eggs / nor that mundificatyft / nor barley mele / but stryke the wound about
with warm oil of roses / and there upon straw the powder of myrtylle berrys /
And lay on the wound white washing turpantyn between twolynnen clotys / And
as ye pain is withdrawn / and the swellynge begin to syncke / than shall

Of wounds in the bonys. Ca. xx.
When the bonys be broken without woundynge of ye flesh yt is named a broke
or breaking / and as the flesh with the bonys is woundyd and there with that
is callyth a broken wound / or a wound with the brekinge. And such wounds
happens in. ii. manners. The first. as the flesh with the bone is wou^dyd with a
sherp w^pen / and that happenyth in sundry manners / sometime the bone is
overthwart hewyn of and sometime is but a part hewyn of / and some is but a piece
cut of. And another manner / when the flessh of the bone is wounded sometime
when one is beten with a clobbe / or with a staf / that the flessh and the
bonys is brusyd and perysshed. sometime that one fallyth from a heythe / or that
one is hurt with the cast of a stone or with another thing / not only the skyne
/ but also the flesh / and ye synewes be hurt / wherewith the bone be wounded
/ nevertheless seldon it happens yet it happens sometime that the bone is
rent or splenttyd / sometime in great pieces / and sometime in little pecys. All
these a fore said poynttes must the surgyon have in the remembrance er he
begin any cure te do. The first / if any comes to you with a membre therein
that is broken a bone and skyne / nor flesh is not woundyd nor brusyd / than
so do as I shall learn you in ye chaptre of brekynge of the bonys without
hurtynge of the flesh /

Ifany body com to you he that is wou^dyd through ye skyne / flesh / and bone
/ with a sherp knyf sword dagger or any other wepen / so be hold it well or yt
bone is a deell or holle cut through in l^ngth / or thwart / or pecys be cut of
ye bones or that ye bone ha^gyth on the utter skin or that there be any small
splyntis of a bone / yt is ofnedefull to have / as an arm pype / or alegpype /
or a brain pan / or ytis a bone of no great need / as rybbis or kneshyfes or
there lyknes. ^s there a part of the bone cut with a sharp sword / and that
fleme next the bone is cut of therewith from the bone / so is that flesh hard
to grow on that bone wherefore must that bone be showen with an instrument where
with that the flesh may grow again on the bone with vnguentum aureum secu^dum
Mesue / thereafter shall you lay one mundificatiuum and consolat^ / that is a
grene woundyd salve / like as it stondyth in Antithodario / which salve takyth
away the great currupcyon of matter / and helyth withal / as the wound is
before fyllyd with flesh / and if there by any small little pecis or splyntis
of the bone / so it is needful that the pecys by subtylte with your instrument
taking the pecys a way / and than shall you hele the woundys like as I have
said before / and if there be any pecys aperynge out / that shall you cut of with
your saw / also if any little pecys of bonis be ha^gyng on ye flesh for need
must ye lose that from the flesh / and the skin sow to gydder again / and
so bynd it like an other wound / and if that bone belongyth to a pype or to
joint so nedyth to bestow it with your hand in his place again / and thereon bynd
it with your bond in like wise as I shall say in ye Chaptre of ye brekynge of
ye bonis / and as in your byndynge / ye must leave a hole ope^ayenst ye wou^d so
as ye may every day dres ye said wou^d without taking of ye said bound / and
this wound is to heel like as another wou^d with more mu^dificatyfe up that the
matter the lesser shall hurt the bone for ye losing of the bone / therefore
need you to lay adefensyuum above the wound round about the joint / that the
joint have no combraunce with the moystnes or superfluyte of the blood that ye
matter might make the bone ^o^e / And ye pacyent must have good rule in meet /
in drink / and laxatyfe / for that lets that no^postumacyo^ co^myth. But
Rasys says in the vii. book of his surgery / that the personys that has
bonys broken they shall eet but course meet which makyth course blood whereof
ye so^er may the bone be hole / yt is as the skyn^e and flesh is not woundyd
/ and that ye bonys be not pery^^hyd by the air / and incontinent all such
woundys must be set in his place and than sowed / that there come none
impostume thereto / and drive ye flode or the impostume away / and bind it so
as I have said before / and the wound shall be made hole without losyng of
the bound. As a wound is in any bone that needful is to the body / ye shall
hot take out one of them / as many as there be / as nigh as ye can ^teuery piece
by him self in his place.

Of a deep wound and not well seen. Ca. xxi.
OFten times is the preuy and deep wound helped with a drink inward without
sowynge and byndynge And where it fortune not so to be / so says Galienus in
tercio teg ni / that he shall take away the multitude of blood / and it shall
be helped with a good figure. Through the figure understand Auice^ / that
the mouth of the wound shall be downward (...) the depte shall stand above /
for the multitude of ye matter may the beter go out / as Galien? spekyth ad
Glaucone^ / wha^ he helyth a deep wound and the wound was in the kne / and
the stytchynge went downward to the skyn / than he commanded tolyfte up the
skyn bone upward hyer than the kne / because the wound ye sooner might be hole
/ and the matter the sooner should avoid. July ke wise may be done unto an
arm. And if the wound will not avoid the ma^tes and can not cleanse it with any
water spowted therein as thereto belongs / Tha^ work after the wordys of
Galienus / he says in ^^ne tc^^terapentis / As ye wound has a deep hole and
preuy / so must ye take heed if the wound may be clensedor not / And as the
wound is to be made clean / so make it clean with a washing and with
threstynge out of the matter with a good byndynge / beginynge at ye end of the
stytchynge of ye wound / and shall be bounden the longer the los^ for cause ye
matter may not be bound behynd in the wound / and that at the mouth of the
wound the matter may better avoid out And if that may not be with byndynge /
so must ye seek another way / and that is in ii. manners. The first manner /
that you begyn^e on the mouth of the wound and cut up all holownes to ye
ground of ye wound if that may be done without harm of any veins / synewes
and musclus or lacertes. The other manner is / if that this cuttynge may noot
be / so put in the wound a serchyng yro^ / or a wax ca^dell unto ye ground
of the wound / and so make a hole at the end of the wound / that the matter
thereby may be clensyde / and bind the wound in like wise as is a fore said /
Ateche mouth of ye wound shall the byndynge be loser and so see / so as the
wound may be cleansed the better / And master Brunus did put and use in
both the endys of ye wou^des tentr^

And master Guydo vsyd with one tente because the pacyente should have the
lesser pain / and round about laid he one defensyuum / and upon the wound
laid he one mundificatyuum / and there after one consolydatiuum / and after that
he helyde the wound like another wound / And if the wound had many hooles
within / that you can not know / so wa^e ye wound with ye after written water
that some what sherp as / and must be medlede with one mundifycatyfe / and so
must ye spowt the wound thryse or. iiii. times / and than dry ye wound / and
bind it in like manner as is aforsayd / from the nedermoste part to the mouth
of the wound / and ye matter or moystnes shall be taken away with the spowte /
and not threstyng the matter with the hand taking out the matter of ye wou^dis
mouth / and ye would thynk to threst ye matter out / but you should threst ye
blood out of it / which would be matter / whereby it lettyth the helyng of it /
and does much harm. In like wyle I have seen by a harbor yt was not
co^nynge / to him came one with a wound in his arm which wound gave much
matter out / and the harbor threst out every day much matter / and with the
threstyng threst out much other blood which was matter after ward / and it was
so long time during / toward marryng of ye arm / which might at fryst (...)
little labor be helped / in like wise as I have helped him. The first manner
should be / yt above ye wou^d upward should be laid one desensiuu^ about ye
arm which should defend the arm. That other is to rule him of good meetis
and drink is whereby ye les moystnes should be unto him The. iii. is to make
holys on the other perte of the wound / and there out taking ye matter / with
washing and in spowtynge / there with the wound should be clensyd / and the
arm bound round about / that there come no hete thereto / In such manner in
like wise have I wrought and made some holys / there the matter ca^me out with a
spowte / ye other holys I stopped / one mu^dificatyf I need spowte therein / with
a good byndyng I bound it / and gave him good rule of mete and drink / and of
good purgacyons / and so doing a weye the corrupcio^ from above / and wherewith
was defendyd the membre of the arm / whereby he was made hole / and had I done
/ the hole arm must be cut of. This have I done writ that ye shall know how
ye may order you in such a wound / so as all other parsonys not to be lost
of their membr is / whereby as all surgeons should come to great shame.
Therefore take heed to these wou^dys aforesaid. And that lauamente which is
(...) clensynge water / and it is made in like wise as here under appears /
and it helyd all hooll woundys / an it clensyth and makyth flesh / and it
helyd therewith. If any body ware shote^ or stryken through the body / or that
ye wound will fystule or raacke / so spowte therein ye same lauame^t lewke
warm / and that will ^ull all the matter out / this dod twyse or tryse in a
day there after as the patyent may suffere / so long that the water may
come clear out of the wound.

A clensynge water
Thus make the lauamet. Take rose honey strayned. vi. ou^cys. read rose leuys /
Ca^myll flouris / of each. iii. ounce. mastic. i. ou^. fra^kensens a half
ounce. myrra. i. dragne ^ryos. i. ounce. Frensshe wine / or soden elsate wine.
ii. pound weight. water of pla^tayne small and great / water of read rosys
that growyth in the coorne / water of caprifolium / water of peruinca agrestis
/ water of oken leuys / of each a pound. Will you have a stronger to dryut the
matter more out / take alume. i. ounce Balausti Pessidie Nucis cypressi / Orobi
/ curscely stamped of each a drane / will you that the flesh grow / put
thereto Sercocolle an ounce / is the wound heart / so put thereto camfere a drane
and a half / The drynes is made thus / take consolida mayor. viii. ounces
pensedanum. iiij. ounces / alum. ii. ounces. smithes water dystuled per
filtru^. iij. pyntes / and sodde^tyll the thryde patre be consumed / and that
water shall be made warm and ye bond shall be depttherin / wherewith ye shall
bind the membre like as is before said / If ye will make a stronger
mu^dificatiuum / that more clensyth and caused the matter to rest.

One mu^dificatyfe.
Take vnguentum egypciacum. ii. ounces. Alum one ounce / white fra^kensence an
half ounce / myrra one drane. Reed wine ii. pound / all together sodden a
little / than spowte this in the hole of this sore. For I have done great cures
therwyth.

Of wounds com by venymous stynges / or of wode doggys bytynges / or of snakes
/ adders / scorpyons / or of other such like. Ca. xxij.
Will you beholpen of the venym bytynges of beestes / So it is good that ye
follow ye learning of master Auicenna / Rasys / Rabbi moses / and Heuricus.
For they have spoken of all venym / And the cure thereof which belongs more
to the phesycon than to the surgyon. And all such bytynge wounds it is in.
ii. manners. The one is done of a venymous be / ye other is done of no vem
mobeest / In lykenys as the bytynge of a man or woman / or of a dog / of an
hog / horse / or a katte / or there lykenes.

The venymous bytynge of mad dogs ye styngynge of a snake / or adder / or ye
poysonynge of a ^oode / or of a spyder / or any other like venymous be. It
is in two manners to have in cure. The one is / to take away the venymous matter
by the* he^cyon within / defenddynge the body from hurt / through the which
hurt the racyente may be in ieopardy of his life. The other manner is. the
venyme without shall be taken away by the Surgean / and shall be caused to grow
flesh / and than heled / and keep the hole of the wound some days ope^er ye
begin to cure the wound. The knowledge of the bytynge of a venymous be.
ye may know by the compleynynge of the pacyent / for he shall have great pain
and brennynge in his body / whereby ye may know it is to him great harm and
greffe / for the venym or poysone desires none other but to overcome the
heart. And to such venymous bytynges or styngynges it behoned you to take good
head. And if so be that the parson in the beginning feel not the token / it
will afterward apere as paraduenture a month after / a year aftor. vii. years
after so may it be. For I have seen a child byte^ of a mad dog / ye wound
was heled and a year after ye same wound began the rotte / and ye child was
mad and dyed thereof. Wherefore if there come any parson to you dyten of any
be that is not venymous / and no token on them ap^ie ye need to do none
other thing than you do to another cure. The cure of bytynge of all venymous
beestes / Galienus in tertio terapen. says / when that ye pain comes of a
styngynge or bytynge of a be / you shall take away the pain / and also the
venyme / by boxynge / or lettynge out of wyn de / or brennynge with a hot Iron
/ or with a warm bath / and this makes loose the hole substance of the wound
/ or lay there to some dry thing hot to take a way the beny^e / Therefore
commands Lanfrancus and other surgyons to set thereto a ventous and take away
the venymous blood or that evil blood shall be se^ed or brent with a hot
Iron or cauteries / that the common people bre^neth with a kaye of his church
Upon such a wound some layth a simple medecyne to draw out the venyme / ye
which is done with garlyke / and with on ^ons stamped with buter. Also as
Guido says does the common people for lack of surgyan in like wise / they
take a hynne and plucketh the feathers from her arse / and lays ye hens arse
all quycke upon ye wound / and the hen dies of the venyme that comes out
of ye wound. The wound shall be open at the leest. xl. days. Than the
inwardly cure behooves more for the phesycy on tha^ for ye surgya^ / Ye shall
know how to take away the venymous blood. In the beginning you shall not let
out the blood of the vain / because that ye venym should not be sprede through
all ye me^bres / and also give them nothing laxatyue in the belly / that ye
venym go not with in through all the members / therefore must be set ye ven to^e
aforesaid / which strongly pulls to him the venymous blood / and after the
third day it is good to be let blood on the vain and so to cause the
Melancoly with light medecynes / as in dressynge Epitimy with gootes milk /
and he must be in rest of his heart / Also he must take and ^ethe the heed and
fete of a yielded sheep / and in the brothe thereof often times was^he his feet
/ And if it be so that the parson may not beholen with the simple drynes / tha^
shall ye make him a composita.

A dry powder.
Make this composyta of licium / assa dulcis / bolus armenicus / terra
sigillata / abscinthiu^ / nigella / genciana / all these meddled togeder / so
take it in. Or take ye ashes of a crefysshe that is dried in an oven / take
thereof. iiii. parts / and franke^sence. ii. parts / medied them to gyder and
make thereof a powder / and take thereof every day. ii. dranes. with wine wherein
is sodden Bybergeyl which is called portulaca in latin and Rue or herb of
grace. Or take. vi. parts of a sihes of a crefysshe / of Genciana iii. parts
/ Terra sigillata one part / and take this medecynes as is aforesaid. If you
in ye beginning of his great need had not come / and the pacient has taken
evil sykenes / or ill accydentes of melancolye / by heaviness of dremes / wrath
or trowble / that he can give none answer ye nor nay / it is the token
ofmelancoly / which weketh ye nature / for that ye shall give the^ this
medecynes of Cantarides that dryueth out through the vryne the melancolyous
blood / yfit be possible. And the medecyne ye must make after this manner. Take
Cantarides / that is great and old / and there of cut away the heedes foot
and fatnes and take thereof half anou^te / lentes cleansed / saffran / spicanardi
/ clowes / synamon / pepper / of each a drane. dryue^ in powder / and meddled
with rue water / and thereof make a trocysce / and of the trocysce ye shall give
him the wayght of. vii. barley corns / so often till he pysse blood / tha^ he
shall be in health / and after the (...) the (...) (...) shall first be heled.
I^wyse does to ye (...) de that is by^ ^le / or any other (...) ny^us be /
Span^all you make the wound wyder and (...) ^on ventoses or boxes for to take
out the evil blood / ^t is also good to ^he ye place with a hoote iron that
Lanfrancus (...) proved often / and it lets no comyng^ swellynge nor impo^ /
and presume not to hele the wound unto the time ye venyme be out of it /
therefore the wound some days be open /

A powder.
An expert powder for the dytynge of a (...) dog or a wolf / Brent in a
sharde (...) erthe^ pot ^ysshe that has eggs / ^make it in small powder /
and of the powder put every day twyse in the wound / and so shall you hele it /
nevertheless keep ye wo^^ ^e (...) as long (...) you ca^ / as is before said.

How you shall ^ure these aforsayd wou^des. ca. xxiij.
As ye wound voydeth mat^ / (...) shall you cleanse it / (...) then ye shall
cause the ^she to grow / and after that the (...). The clensynge (...) (...)
(...). The first (...) (...) / to tente it with lynte laid within to ^^^ke out
the matter / or for to ^^pe y^ (...) (...) (...) the matter may (...) his (...)
/ The other manner is with washing (...) ^eth ye matter and the (...). The ^es
is used for vi. causes / T^ is in the narowe wound which (...) must be made
wide / and take out (...) of the ground / ly^ (...) (...) ^s a hol^ wound
there as (...) matter ^ed to draw it out. The other (...) is for to make in ye
holowe wound / for as long as ye matter lies in the wound there will no
flesh grow in the wound / but it will always rote more and more. The. iii.
manner is in the wounds that is altered by the air / or by his one nature that
is comen to ^oftyng with the tents and so cleansed. The. iiii. manner is to the
wounds that the one gothe to the other / and the one is cleansed through ye
other. The. v. manner is in holding the open a sore unto the time that the
nature be cleansed. The. vi. manner is of an eating wound / that the (...)
sha^^owke the wate^ of ye wound / and cast out the ^yll flesh rosideabout.
The. vii. manner is in the wounds by the bones / that the matter shall come the
better out of it. Therefore were ye that the tents be made in diverse manners.
for the tents that is vsede for the clensynge of the wounds / they are (...)
of fair shauynges of white lynnen cloths and some be made to hold the lyppes
open of the wound with fine small ^owe / or small pieces of fine ly^ / or of
fine cotton as Rasys did (...) (...) of silver / or of ty^e / (...) as (...)
(...) ye nose thrylles for to take the air / or to put into the wound that
the matter of him self may go out. Some he made for tomake narow wou^des wyder
/ and that is made of the rote of gencian^ of a sponge / as I have learned in
the. xv. chaptre. The clothes of lynne^ laid dry in the wounds / and somtymes
laid to stepe in (...) as the surgyon thinks best. And as the wound is
cleansed of the matter / and the wound is almost hole It is needful to lay
(...) a drawing plaster which ^eth flesh and heleth / list wise does the
wounds plaster / as I shall learn in Anthydodario. If ye wound be changed
by much matter casting / and yt ye wound have changed his course in an
^^^us / which is an old (...) / As soon as ye have cleansed ye same wound ye
must cause ye flesh to grow / for it is called^ wound co^posita or vlcus /
and they behooves all times a mu^dificatiuu^ / incarnati^u^ / and thereto consol
idatiuu^. A symplecuttynge wound yt is not changed by the air / and bydeth in
his co^ple^^yon / the wound needs no more but the helynge of the wound. The
manner to cause ye flesh to grow in the wound after the stoppynge of the
blood / and that ye be ^re of ye imp^ cleanse the wound of the gre^ ^atter with a
mu^dificatiuum as here after stondeth in the chaptre of ye mu^dificaty^^s / and
tha^ wasshe ye wound with reed wy^ / and after ye lay upon the wound ye drynes
yt causes flesh to grow / as herafter I shall learn you. The h^lp we wound
or ye wound in the synewes / ye shall heel it like as of the^ in every chaptre
shows. And as ye wound is full of flesh / so cause therevpo^ ye sky^^e to
grow. And to make ye skin shall find in ye (...) of ye co^solidati^e.

^Or the helyng of fresshe wou^des (...) bawine artificial like as is used in

(...) ordered together / and the pieces yt were ^ed together / so ha^dell (...)
member ^out pain / if it be possible / so as I before and after shall write
and after ye clo^ynge of the wound comes ye helynge. The manner of byndyng of
fresshe wounds is in three (...) / as Any. says / ye first does ye flesh
grow / and ye other dryuethout / ye third holds / the byndynge for to do
grow flesh is clou^ in two / and ye heed of (...) ba^delayde on ye vain
against ye wound / and bind ye end against ye uppermost (...) of member /
and yt is from ye wound / and that other end of the band on ye nether ^te of
ye member / and so take both (...) ends / and bind it backward to ye
wounded place / ye time of ye ba^de taking of is wha^ ye pa^ye^t may no longer
suffer it. With this bynding ye lyppes of ye wound were bound together / and
takes a way the swellyng / the hard byndynge which dryueth out she be used
to ye hole and deep wound yt with in is (...) ten for to drive ye matter out /
and yt no^e other matter shall come to ye place / this do with ye ba^de yt on ye
one end is cloue^ / and begin first to bind on ye nether ^te of ye member and
bind it with ye hardest / and so forth upward unto ye vpper^te of ye member /
Like as wha^ any person is wounded in ye leg / so bind ye leg bynethe
upward above ye knee to ye belly / and let the ba^de be slytte at ye kne to
have ye kne at large / and that he may bow it / If the wound be on ye left
side there comes out of evil unclean blood / so it is against the mylte / and
if it be on ye right side / it is against the liver / there comes allmoyst nes
to the members. The band that ye drynes hold / is vsedon the plate there as
no hyndynge may be / like as a heed / neck or belly / or as swellynge and
dyslocacyon. This band shall be with many ends / and begin the bind upon the
sore place on both sides. And this band shall betaken of without pain / and
if it cleue by the matter / ye shall suppe it with wine till it be lose Ga^lienus
says / it is vsyd / and that the hands should be made of good old lynne^
cloth that is soft / smote / and clean / broad and long after the bygnes of
the members / for the byndynge of a shulder / the band must be. vi. fyngers
broad. The ba^de of a thygh of a leg must be. v. fyngers broad. The band for
an arm must be. iij. fyngers broad / and the band for a finger must be one
finger broad / and the length of the band shall be as it is need by the
dyscrecyo^ of surgeon. The manner of lyunen clothe or plumacioles it is
profitable to bind together ye parts that be lose / for to fortyfye yt hotenes
on that membre / and to take away the heaviness of the hand. Ye may make it of
fine towe / or of hemp / or of flax that is well hecclede. and some makes it
of wolle / and now they make it of dowble lynnen cloth or with a sponge / and
of them shall be laid ii. or. iij. as the surgyan thinks best.

This before written sometime is laid on the wound dry / and sometime with the
white of an egg / sometime with wine / and some time with oxcicrata / and
sometime with oil or with other moystnes / and this is in. iij. manners. The one
is thrysquare / yt prayseth Auicenna / and they lay it on every side of the
lyppes of the wound / and upon ye wound / and it causes the flesh to grow
/ and the wound to come to gyder. The second is round / and is laid upon ye
other to hold the natural hete. The third is fouresquare and they be laid
for hurtynge of the band.

How that the wounded person ought to dressed and ruled in mete / in drink.
etc. Ca. xxv.
IN the rulynge of ye (...) ^son / I will follow ye ^yge of walls Auice^na /
Galienes / La^cfra^cus (...) / and other masters says. It is not good to give
ye pacyent at ye first wine after yt he is wounded in the heed / or in any
other place there as many synewe is / and much blood / for no thing gothe so
sone through ye me^bres and also ye brains as ye wine does / and makes much
vapores / therefore it is somtyme^ to ye hole parsone hurtynge. The some persons
that is hot / and moist that has much blood / and is wounded in the heed or
synewes / he must for bear wine till he be hole. Unto ye a cold person ye
shall give wine that is te^pered after. iij. or. iiij. days / when ye be sure
of the member yt there come no ymposh^ me nor swellyng / and his drink shall be
barley water / or water wherein is sodde^ crommes of breed / or cold water in
ye somer or with the. x. perte of ye wine of a pome garnet / or with the. vi.
part of vergyous. The parson yt is hot and dry of co^plexcyo^ / he shall not
ete flesh / milk / eggs / nor no men that hastily changes / the pacyent
shall be content with barley water / or ^oten pap^ or with milk of almons / ^he
that has a wound in ye heed / thereof speaks La^frances / ye shall give none
other than of almons / and no fruit that is wyndy and makes vapores / as
hasyll nottes / or other nottes the which is hurtynge to the heed / also he
mayete lettu^e / and cro^mes of bread sopped in water therein doing suge^ / and
y^ he be so syke that he may not be without (...) shall give him cheryns /
small byr^ or young gootes flesh / or bear / with vergyous / or wine of pome
garnet. This d^ shall he keep till the time he be sure from the swellynge or
of impostumacyo^ / and yt is as the pain and the swellynge of ye me^bres gothe
away / and as the wound gives naturally matter / or it is heleth to the
growing of the skin. And he must keep him from woman's co^uersacyo^s. and as
he is sure of the forsayde so may he ete and drink measurably of strong metes
unto the time he come to his first estate / than he may drynk good wine / and
ete good flessh as hens / capons / motton / and of all that makes good blood
/ and that brings nature in. If the pacyent be weke of conplexcyon / and has
by nature aneuyll stomach / it is need full at ye first to give him flesh
that is dressyd with good rotys or specery / as synamon / gynger / and other
like / but metely. Beside all this ye shall give him in the beginning. I
drasarcka^ that is good of smelling / and. iij. days after the wine If the
wound be with broken bones / or the bone be broken with out wound / so shall
you give him good metes that makes good strength in the bone again / like
as mele pappe made of whete mele well sodden / and give him to ete of bestes
feetes / heedes / and eres / and other things wherewith the body may be the
stronger. Wherefore it is needful to the Surgean to know the complexcyon / the
strength / and the age of the pacye^tes / and the use of the loud / also ye
time of the year.

Of the accydentes or fallynges of dyseases that comes to the wounds. ca xxvi.
THe accydent of the wound is amended after the nature of ye too fallynges /
The accydences commonly coming to (...) wound it is paynfull / swenynge evil
complexcyon / Itchynge / para^ius / the crampe / febres / flawnas / and
chaungynge of the wound. The first ye shall know that ye wound shall never
cure unto the time the accydent be taken away / the accyde^s causes that it
heleth not / and pain draws the matter unto ye wounded place for to make an
impostume / that is a swell with a manner of reednes / and for that we pain
must be dryue^ away / ye which pain is commonly taken away with strykynge the
membre with warm oil / and if you put thereto yt white of an egg it is ye
(...) and if there be no great heete / do to ye oyl^ the yelke of an egg / and
that clemeth (...) wound. When the pain is great then it is needful to put
thereto a little. Optu^ or else the bark of mandragora / As Master wylhelmus
counsayleth. The. iiij. masters prayseth thereto to take ye ^oore of nyghtica
sta^ped with hogs greece / but the master Theodorices prayseth a plaster made
of ye leaves of small malowes dressed and stamped with small brannet and do
thereto a little oil of roses it is the better / or make a plaster of the
cromes of white breed laid in milk one night / and tha^ sta^pe it and do
thereto oil of roses and the yelke of an egg / and ye slyme of parsely sede /
and if it be need / do thereto a little opium. But I have in such accyde^ce
used in plasters / sethyng malowe leaves / elder leaves / aptu^ / and sethe them
i^ water stamped small and do thereto rose leaves and oil of coses the third
part made warm / and stryke it upon a cloth / and so lay it warm on the
wound. But in great pain I did thereto leaves of in squiamus sodden / as
aforsayd / and a ^ewe leaves of Nychtsca myxed therewith because it repercuteth
and resolves. But i^ ye wi^ter I took dry roots of pe^sedanu^ / and lynseede
/ malow leaves / all this stamped in powder with a little oil of roses sodde^ /
or with old bacon greece / but that is not so good / which more desire to ripe
tha^ to resolve / Therefore I have done thereto many times a little walt root /
or ambra in powder for to dry yt member / if there come an impostume yt you
cowde not restrynge / let it ripe and cut it up and cleanse it and cause the
flesh to grow and hele it / As hereafter shall be learned in the chapptre of
the maturaty^e mu^dificatiue and co^solidatiue. If there be an evil
compleccyon yt is hoote / it is to be known by the reednes and bladders about
the place / than make the place cold / but not with mandragora or iusquiami /
for that coleth not / but takes a way the feeling / therefore they shall be
used alone in pain / and to this colynge must ye have that that coleth and
dries with ease / as roses / plantayne / vngue^tu^ albu^ / Secondum Rasis / with
camfere / and other defensive / defending that membre / like as I shall learn
you in Antithodario If the complexcyon be cold ye shall know it by softenes /
and if ye place be white colowred / make ye place warmd with wine / sodden
therein ^se eere and camamell flowers and reed arthemesia / and melilorum / or
with vaguentum basilicon or f^s^um. If the complec^yon be dry and moysty / it
may be amended with his contrary. And if thereto comes the febres / the crampe
and wekenes / than call thereto the phesycyon / And often times or the phesycyon
can come ye pacyent may dye / Therefore it is needful to write of the same
wekenes / for it is a way to the death / and it is called by some masters ye
little death / Therefore ye must comfort the pacyent / that the feebleness or
fayntnes come not to him / and to avoid ye people out of ye chamber / because
they should not make the chamber root / nor to put the syke in fere / And it
is wisdom when the feebleness comes on to / give the pacyent a cromme of white
breed deped in wine with rose water / and let him drink somewhat of the wine.
Therefore says Galienus the wine is of nature somewhat hot and gives
comfortynge / therefore give them that has syncopin / or to the^ that is feeble
or in swownynge / spryncle Rose water / or cold water in his face / and if
there be no rose water / than ye must pluck him by the nose / and by the eeres
/ Cry loud and call him by his name / and give him a clappe on ye cheke / and
ye shall do all other things that the phesycyon commands you to do.

A clensynge water,
If the wound be sty^kynge and uncleanly / take lycoryce powder of each an
ounce / and sethe it with a pynte of wine and do thereto vytryole a dragma and
wasshe the sore / for it heleth new or old wou^des. Another for the fame /
Sethe honey and water together / and therewith wasshe the wound / and after that
take vnguentum apostolorum / or vnguentum egyptiacum that is stronger / and
cleanses very well /.

A salve.
as ye wey worms comes about ye wound. Than make a salve of greeks pyrche /
and with oil olyue / and there with stryke ye wound against the bytynge of the
wey worms that is about the wound / do thereto a little quycke silver in
bernysshe / and meddle there with white leed / and thereof make a salve / and
stryke therewith the wound. Also as a wound is eten round about / so stamp
together Sauiana and reed coolys which is called in latin bleta rubea / and
meddle it with vynegre / than press that sap out / and mydle therewith white
led / and salve ye wound round about with that same / and is ye must cut the
wound open again / and that he suffer great pain / than take ground worms
in a pan / and thereto do oil of roses and let it warm softely / and strain
it / and do thereto gentle reed roses / and beenne flower / and Rosyn well
poudred till it be thycke as like a falue / and when you will occupy it make it
warm and lay it on the wound / and it will take away ye pain. If there come
any worms in ye wound / take wormmoyd or absitiu^ in latin and persyclouere^
/ or folia persicarum / and saint James herb / all together sodden in wine /
and lay ^ton the wound / and it shall help them.

Of the general wou^des i^ the heed. Ca. xxvij.
THe heed is somtymes wounded with cuttynge / and sometime with pusshynge and
co^tusye / and this appears both sometime without wound or without brekynge
of ye brain pain / and sometime with brekynge of it / and the brekynge is
sometime thrughe going / and sometime not / and these be so^tymes small / and
so^tymes great / and of this so^me be clean / and so^me with accyde^tis of
pain and impostumacyon / and hurtynge of the pa^nycles. The tokens of fracture
or rence of the brain pan is taken in sundery manner / First of hye falling
/ or with a great stroke. The second is as ye contusye or wound is very
great. The iij. is for the pain that he suffers often times / he lays his
hand on the place / and with your finger you shall know the thynnes of the
skin and the departing of the bone / and as he blows or keeps his breath
inward / the^ shows ye moystnes coming out thrughe ye rent / and
departing of the bone. The. iiij. is / of the accydente coming in the same
time as a Pasy fallyge / or swymmynge in the heed / or in forsenes of speaking
/ or in parbrakynge. The. v. token is / as ynke or masticke is strykyng upon
the departing of ye bone / and if there abide any blackenes in the departing
/ or any drynes upon ye pla^ of the wound when it is anointed / this (...) me
is a true token of a rent or departing The tokens of the cuttynge of the
pa^nycle is of sundry manners. First of the pain knowing / for incontynente
foloweh the swymmynge of the heed or falling / that is Uertigo or Scotomia in
lattyn. The second token is / the color of the face / or eyes / for as the
face is reed and full of small pymples / and his eyes sem^ reed with darnes. The.
iij. is / as the blood go^he out of his nosethrylles / through the mouth / and
through the eeres. The. iiij. is / as his speech faylleth having no
understanding / and shaking with the axes / or perbrakynge or may not sleep /
nor make his water.

The token of the woundynge of the brain may be known by sundry manners.
First as gothe great cloddes out of ye wou^ de and no matter. The second is /
as his understanding is from them / and when the wound is on the foreheed /
and as the wound is in the hynderparte of the heed so loses he his memory /
and that the pacyent thereto have great fere and ygnoraunce. The token of
coming of an impostume is to know by sundry manners. First / as ye pa^nycles
is blown hyer than the wound / and seems ceed / and moves not. The second
/ as ye eyes is reed and swollen / seems as they would fall out. The. iii. is
the axes withcomyng of heet. The. iiii. as ye might is altered in spasina /
crampe / axes / and in madness. The sentence The brekynge Crane or braynpa^ne is
very peryllous and the cuttynge of the brain / and the corrupcyo^ and wou^dyng
of his pa^nycles yt is deedly as ypocras says / but as the wound is very
small. Therefore is the evil accydentes and tofallynges peryllous and deedly /
as he abides and not departs / like as axes / shaking / crampe / swymmynge
/ or swellynge of ye eyes / and darkness and reednes of the eyes. In the
fracture or woundynge of the heed must be taken head for the peril and a^entes
the space of. C. days. as ye master ^og^ri^ says. And sum other masters
says. xlvi. days / and than is the last term out of ye sharp sykenes. And
as the. iiii. masters says / it shall be. xv. days. for than is the term
out of the sharp sykenes. If the blacknes of the pa^nycle called Dura matter
may not be cle^sed with honey / it is a toke^ of death / as Paul's says And the
fracture crauei or braynpa^ne in ye full of the moon / it is great peril and
Jeo. perdy if the pacyent shall escape of ye death. as Rogerius says. In the
consolydacye or helynge of the braynpanne / it is good yt shows reed flesh.
In the wound of the heed is good small swellynge / and good dysgestynge of the
matter. And if the swellynge be great and gothe away hastily with* out a
reasonable cause / that is very ill.

The masters dyscordeth in this cure. Some masters they work in all he dwou^
des with vncoueryng and cuttynge the bone / for cause of ye evil matter that
within craneum or braynpanne is gadereth / may softely be cleansed and dried.
Sum other masters as Ancelmus of Gene / and some of Padua / and all yt Frence
masters / and the Engglys masters / they work with flesh growing and
consolydatyfe or helynge with their plasters / drynkes / and good wine / and
with byndynge. and they say / if the matter may be taken out wtout^ taking of
ye bones with medesynes or drynes / it is the best that may be done. The
odoricus causes the flesh to grow in the wound with drink / and wine with
towe. Henrices heleth the wound without drink with his plasters. and both
these masters unclose and lift up the old fracture as it is past. iiii. or.
v. days. And Lancfran cus works in all wounds making flesh with tents /
which he depeth in two parts of oil of roses / and one part of honey. and
does thereupon a mo^dytycatyffe of barley meele and honey / or with rosyn and
wax with the heedpowder / except in two accydentes. The first as the bone
presses. the other as it prycked. for cause / some say the ye in ye workyng with
the instruments of iron follows often much peril and hurtynge of the
alteracyo^ of ye air / wherewith comes the impostumacyo^. In yt cure is
needful to have masters of sundry dyscrecyon. Therefore I write. ix. lernynges
which Guydo writes i^ his surgery. The first learning is / that the wound of
the heed has much indyfference of the wounds of ye other menbres / the
gentylnes of the mary / and for the roundnes of the brain can not be preserved
with byndynge / like the wounds of other me^bres be. The second lernyn^ge is
/ that to the wound of the heed yt is great / it is nedfull to be let blood
on ye vain / and a purgacyon in the belly / at the leest ones a day going to
the draught by themself / or with some suppositoria / or with a glyst / or with
some other thing to avoid with sofnes / for to take out the evil humors
thrughe the way which may be ye less pain to him / and that the rennynge of
the blood may be stopped / and the accydente may be me^ded. The: iii. lernyng
is that to the wound of the heed ye shall shere of the here / and make it
moysty with some what water and oil / As wylhelmus says / ye must take heed
that there come no here nor water / nor oil to the wound / for yt will let
the helynge / and in the beginning does that ye matter and ye pains be lessed
/ and do in the wound ye white of an egg / and after that beginning it
cleanses the wound / and makes the flesh to grow / as it may be said
hereafter / The sides and the wound round about shall be often times
anointed with the salve of Bolus or with oil of Roses / to slake ye evil
matters and pain / and that the impostuma^yon come not thereto. The. iiii.
learning is to take heed that the wound take no cold / like as Ipocrates
says / the cold is evil to the synewes / bones / mary / and al so pussheth
and changes the air of the pryncypall members / and therefore Wylhelmus
gives counsel / that in the winter as the wound shall be dressed / ye must
have thereby a pan with brennynge colles and candell light / and the wyndowes
closed / and after the byndynge the heed must be covered with a coyfe made of a
Ra^mes skin. The. v. learning is / if the wound have matter / in the winter
ye shall dress the wound but ones on the day / and in somer twyse a day / and
the dressynge and cle^synge shall be with cotton or with soft lynt or lynnen
cloth softely without pain. The. vi. learning is / that ye shall lay on the
tent a piece of a soft sponge / that there with may suck / and keep the matter
for fallynd down on the brain. The. vii. learning is / that ye shall have a
substancyall band of a yard long or more / and of. iiii. fyngers broad / and
that you shall roll together save. ii. handful of the end / therewith begin to
bind after the length of the heed / and pulling to the contrary eere or the
wound / and that other party at the eere of the wound / not covering the
eere / and led the bound styffe about the eere / and let that band come
downwarde to the first byndynge / and do it so often till the heed be well
bound / after that manner the masters of Bonony byndeth the. ij. ends under
ye chinne / they of Paris sows in the mids of the foreheed / and if ye will
cause the medecyne to hold alone upon the wound / than must ye make a band
with many ends of a great piece of lynne^ cloth of. iij. hand full long / and
of. ij. hand broad / and cut that on every side. iij. fyngers broad / saving
a hand bread in the mids / and with the ends ye shall bind behind coming
about the neck under the chynne. The. viij. learning is / if there be any
scale of bones left / than wasshe the sore with wine / and if there be none axes
/ give them this capytall or heed powder of Pimpinella / Betonia / Gatiosilata
/ Ualeriana / Osmu^da / and take as much of Pilosella as you shall take of all
the other aforesaid

The. ix. learning is / that the pacyent shall be set and laid in ye
beginning upon that side that leest greueth him. And as ye wound gives
matter / tha^ shall he lie on wounded place to make the matter the better
avoid. This is the before written. ix. lernynges / belonging to the wounds in
the heed Item. Of the wounds in the heed in the beginning till the be sure
from impostumacyon / shall be mitigatyue soft nynge / like the mydlynge is of
three parts oil of rose / and one part honey / and ye old master in sexto
Terapentis takes there to oximel. And if there be no pain / so take. iij.
parts of honey / and one part oil of roses for to cleanse more better the
wound.

When the wound is sure from the impostumacyon / so must the medecyns and
drynes be dryenge without pryckynge / like the heed powder. and that shall be
made thus after the leruynge of master Auicenna.

An heed powder.
Take ^ryos / Ilirica / Orobi farina / Ma^na que est thus minutu^ / Arsstologie
/ Corticibus radicis papaueris. Maystet Brunus does herto Mirra^ / Sarcocolla^
/ Sa^guinem draconis. Lancfrancus and Whelmus also Myrtillos / and nuces
Cypressi.

Of the wou^des in the heed which fortune by cuttynge without brekige of the
brain pa^ne, Ca, xxviii,
IF the wound be simple without losyng of ye substance / that shall be sowed
/ bound / and heled like another wound / and if it be so that the wound lose
his substance / y^ shall cause the flesh to grow again with tents /
powder / sa^ues / and plasters / and hele it like another wound. The sowynge
is not only profitable to a simple wonnde of the heed / but also in many
other great wou^des of ye heed and caused the departing wounds to by^ de to
gyder / and charge from the alteracyon of the air / which does much harm
to the moundes. If it is a small wound cuttyuge / and gothe not through the be
ne / ye shall sow / and cleanse it as is aforesaid. And if it be a greter
cuttyng or wo^ de in the upper part of the heed / it shall not be sowede / but
on the side / and put therein oil of rofes taking away the pain. as the
wound comes to the synewy pannycle that covers ye brain pa^ne. This oil
also loses the lose bonys therein hanging* that they may ye better be taken
out. The^ oil of roses also takes away ye sharpne^ as the pannycle within is
cleansed with ho* The oil of roses aforesaid rectyfyeth the wounds there in is
pain / and dryueth away the evil dysposy cyons of them.

Of the wou^des in the heed come by cuttynge and brekynge of the brain pan /
and not thrughe perced. Ca. xxix.
THis small wound many masters call it Runulam / and is cured like as the
before say de wound is / without brekynge of the brain pan / for in such a
wound comes not much matter / and because the course of the matter may not
come down in ye small cuttynge / is the wound gretter than it is in the side
of the heed / or in the upper part of ye heed. The wound in the side of the
heed is to be cured / like as ye first simple wou^be / but ye must put a weke
or a tente in the neither part of the side wound / because if there be any
matter cleuynge within ye so^e / therewith may you cleanse it / and if ye wound
be in the vpperparte of the heed / ye shall not sow it / but you shall do the
cu re of Galienus in sexto Terapenti / as he wrytteth / The simple brekynge
coming to ye mydle of the. ij. tables craney / thereto it is needful to take
diverse sheres / that is called narowe Rugines / and they may not be a like
great / Therefore as the bone of ye pacyent is uncovered / so must ye first take
the most brodest sheres or Rugine / After that take the (...) sheres that is
narower / then after that take the shallest of all / and this shall you do at
all times in the mids of the. ij. tables. And if the pain desy re none other
/ so shall ye cure be hastily with drynes till it be brought to the end / this
wound may not be sowed in the mids of ye heed / because she may not cleanses
by herself / Therefore she must be dried with tents / and with other things
to suck out ye matter / or else there might abide corrupcyon in the mids of
the. ii. tables to the hurtynge of the bones.

Of a wound in the heed through cuttynge / with brekynge of Craney without
losing of substance to the inner most covering or superficion over the
brain through perced Ca. xxx.
Sometime such a wound will have squyrles or sharpnes / and some will not /
and they be even / and if the wound have squyrles that might prycke and hurt
the pannycle dura matter / they must be made even / and as the sharpnes is even
made with a lenticulare / and with other instruments / then is she heled in
maneras the wound spoken of in ye other chaptre.

Therefore says Galienus / In the wound that comes to the pannycle / and is
alone own rupture or cuttynge without lesynge / so shall you occupy the
aforesaid sheres / and that must you do as the wound is in bregmate / that is
in the upper part of the heed And to the wound that is on the fyde of the
heed / Galienus desires no instrument / but sowynge and clensynge with tentys.
Here upon he says he has seen that bone Bregmatis / and under that is the
bone tymporaus that is the slepynge bone / that has a great clyffe / he
touched it not / but he cut alonely of that bone Bregmatis / and so heled the
parsone / that he lived after many a fair day. And if he had left that bone
Bregmatis therein still / it should anon have corrupts that pannycle / or
Minrinr / or Miringa / or the fracture is fistened or porosed Galienus says
the cause of ye cure where in is none evil matter / nor unclean moist nes /
there is no need to cut of the bone / because that in the sleep of the heed
descends no matter. And if there any matter comes soit is in a good place for
to cleanse. And the aforesaid Galienus wrought in another parsone on the same
manner / he was aferede to touch the brain / because of the hardness of the
slepynge bone. Therefore he made none hole thinking that the brain should come
out through it / and also because that through the side much explantacyon of
the noble synewes gooth out.

Of the wound of the heed with co^tusyon and small brekige of the bray ne
pa^ne. Ca. xxxi.


If the fracture or brekynge to (...) ^rles (...) y^ ^ the lentyenlate / or
other instruments make it even / thereafter as the wound be dressed / ye shall
lay there upon soft sylke wet in honey and inoyle of roses / and with ye end of
the instrument ye shall put in the lynnen cloth between dura matter and the bone
of the brain pa^ne in defending that through remenynge the pa^nycle be not
hurt of the bons / and put there upon soft tents that is a little wette in ye
honey and oil of roses / and than lay a piece of lynnen clothe thereon wette with
that same / for lettynge of the matter to come again / And yet you shall lay
in the wound of the flesh / other dry scrapynge of lynte / or a piece of a
sponge / there as the matter may drink in / and do there upon an heedplaster
going through / and that the matter close not therein / and in the last lay towe
wette in hot wine pressed out / and there upon lay dry towe / and bind it
sortely that it may abide / and not to hard for hurtynge. And as the wound is
well cleansed ye shall take of the first clothe / and put upon the capytalle or
heed powder / to cause the flesh to grow in ye wound / and as the flesh
grows / ye shall close the wound with Consolidatyffe and ^rizerynge powder.

Of the wound with co^tusyo^ and without brekynge of the brain pan Ca.
xxxij.


AUicena cou^ sayleth / that in such a wound ye matter shall be teper cutedor
rested / at ye beginning after ye common dressi^ge / with ye white of an egg and
if ye will do there to oil of roses / for it softeth and does good / and
thereafter resolve the matter with salt wine / and honey / and if there come
matter let it ripe / and open it like an other exiture.

Of the wou^des of the heed with contusyon and with little brekynge of the
braynepanne Ca xxxiij
IF the fracture be little if shall be cured like ye contusyon aforesaid (after
ye saying Galieni) The hole curacyon of this wound is yt it should be resolved
causynge not to come over great matter. And Auicenna says in ye third Canon.
That it is need full to drive the pain away as shortly as it may be / and
preserve ye place of ye wound / that an inpostume come not / and must be done
with euacuacyon / and attractyffe to the contrary side with lettynge and with
sharp glystres / and with pillis cocis. Also lay in the beginning upon the
place a plaster comfortatyffe according to it

A consortatyffe plaster.
Make this plaster with water of Myrte / of Wyllowe / of tasyll called Uirga
pasto ris. or of the oil of Mirte / of lylyes / of roses / and of the powder
Rosary / Balaustiay / Cypressy / Calami / aromatici / Leucium / Camomell /
Mellilote / Boli armeni / aluminis / Mirre / Olibani / atque Citonij / meddled
with wine. and do in the drink Sticados with water and honey / and therewith is he
eased of the pain / as the master Auice^na says. And when the blood comes
out of the brain of the stroke / somust you give the pacyente to drink the
brains of roasted hens with water of Garnet. Theo doricus makes thereto a
plaster / cum baccis lauri / cunino / aniso / sale / thure / atque cribatura
furfuris / dressed with wine.

And ye may give for this fracture a good drink / for by nature of him self
with little help may be holpeu.

Of the co^tusyo^ with a great fracture and brekynge of the brain pan. Ca.
xxxiiij.
IF the fracture be great / it is needful to go to the Surgery / and to ye
more making of the fracture / that proves Galienus i^ sexto / and Auicenna in
quar to. Therefore it is nedeful in great contusyon to uncover it and to make
greter some part of the fracture / by cause the pannycle may be closed of the
evil matter. Thefore said Guido / ye shall not work after ye masters that
says they will cure with their drynkes without surgery / and raysynge of the
bones / it is possible of the small contusyon but not in the great contusyon.
Therefore it is needful to go to the Surgery / of ye fracture of ye brain
pa^ne / ye which Galienus says with short words in sexto Terape^tice / if ye
wound be with great co^tusyo^ / ye brusynge must be cut out with a terrybell or
peerser borynge first about / and after that use cuttynge knyues or tortelles
in ye beginynge. Therefore says Guido. viii. lerrfyng is needful to this
workynge / after that he set that work and operacyon concordynge with Galieno /
Haly abbate / Paulo / and Auice^na. The first learning is / that ye shall not
work there as the most sykenes is / for Galienus says there as ye deeses is
ye shall not work. The. ij. learning is / that for all sayenges take heed for
to speak of the peril that ye pacyent be not in fere. The iii. learning is /
yt ye in the workynge take heed of the co^myssures of the brain pa^ne as nere
as is possible that ye pacyent should be in no fere of falling and hurtynge of
dura matter / as is said in ye Anothomia. The iiij. learning is / take heed of
the full moon / then is ye brain more gretter and comes unto the brain
pa^ne. The. v. learning is / that if the braydynge be in ye nether perte of the
wound it may the better be cleansed. The. vi. learning is / that ye in the
braydynge follow not the end os the cleuynge / for Galienus says it is
enough taking of so much from the bones that the matter may be cle^sedout.
The. vii. learning is / if the bone stand styffe that ye will take ^^t / than
put therein oil of roses / and therewith the bone shall be losed / and than with
out pain ye may take it out. The. viij. is / that you haste with the work as
fast as is possible / and most in pressyng and prye king of the pannycle /
for cause incontine^t comes the impostamcyon and evil accydent / and in the
descendynge of the matter ^thyde not till the seventh day in the somer (...)
the fourth day in the winter / for fere that in the pannycle should fall such
presfynge / that the workinge should be naught Of this workynge speaks
Anicenna in quaito / that in the first ye must se^^ere the here from ye heed
of the wofide / and make. ij. cuttynges therein cleuyng cross wise or / after
thues fie sterynge * as Lantfra^ees says and the one cuttynge must be the
clenynge of the wound / after that ye must uncover all the ^nised bone wherein
the hole shall be And as the blood comes rennyng out there at / so must you fill
the wound with clowtes / which clowtes must be wette in water and vynegre /
or in the white of an egg And if there come no blood / ye shall fill the wound
with fine lynnen cloth dry. And after that ye shall do thereupon the lynte of
lynnen depte in wine and in oil / and bind it than to ye wound as thereto
belongs And if there be none evil accydent coming ye shall begin to hele the
broken bone / but first can^e the pacyent to fyt as thereto belo^weth / and
after that stop his teres with wolle / or with cotton / so that he be not
hurt with the clap of the stroke / And lose the ^ande of the wound / and
cause the clowte ^all out / then dry the wound. Then take (...). men and let
them hold with solte clothes the corners of the wound / and if the bone be
^eble and have small holding / then depart it with cutrynge knyues / and with
the lenticulate / and if it be needful to stryke with the hammer / do it
shortly without long taryenge. If the bone be strong / (...) ^e there
through many holes with the tra^ pane till it be departed (...) other bone And
than as you will takeout ye bone (...) shall it lift up with one eleuatory to
ye ty me the one bone be departed from the other and take it out with your
finger / or with a little tongue / and there after shall you make even ye
sharpnes of the bones. And than shall you cure the wound of the bone like as
is aforesaid of the fracture with the loesynge of the bones.

The mendementes of accede^tes or euylles falling. Ca. xxxv.
IF there come impostume to the wound / and happens most by the pressynge
of the bone / or of ye tents / byndynge / or by cold / or evil rule / tha^
must you hastily list up and depart the cause / taking therfro ye matter with
lettynge blood of the veins and with other purgacyons softenynge the place
with hot oil of roses and with hoote water / wherein is soden hye malowes /
fenigreke / lynseed / camamyll / or with a plaster of popltre / or malowes /
And if there come any blackenes in the ^a^ nycle by the operacyon of the
medecyne shall cleanse it with honey / and oil os (...) and if the blackenes
comes by him self / and comes toward the eyes with other evil tokens /
then is there no tryst of lyffe in the fyke pacyen^. For master Paulus says
The blackenes (...) tokeneth the dystruccyon of natural he^^e.

Of the dyntes of the brain pa^ne like as a kettyll is dynted when they fall
upon a hardestone. Ca. xxxvi.
IF any come to you that is ^^yten with aclu^be / or with a stone / or is
fallen ^om some high place / yt the brain pan is broken that may you know
by ye ^oken aforesaid. If the ^kyn^e and ye flesihe be hole then cut the
skyune the square / that ye may se the brekynge of the heed or brain pan
Then take white lynnen clothe and dear it in oil of roses / and meddle it with
the yolke of an egg. and if it be need to stop ye blood so do to the foresaid
oil this powder here after following.

A powder
Take Mumie / half an ounce. Boly arm (...) / Aluminis / zuccarini / of each a
dragma and thereof make a powder. And if it will not stop with this powder / set
ventoses or bo^es without flemynge on the back of the neck / and that
stops also the blood / and then bind the wound. And wha^ you dress them
the second time mark the nature of the pacyent / and of the wound / an if he
be strong or feeble / or if the fracture be crooked or right / hoked or round.
Then stop his eeres sorheryng of the strokes / and tha^ lose out the crooked
bones. And take heed al ways of the seem of the heed or brain pan / and for
the pannycle that lies under ye brain pan. If the brain pan be dy^ ted
in without departing tha^ draw out that dynte with your instrument / and if
it will not come out / soften the same place ^o oil of roses / so that it may
come out without pain. If the one dele of the bone fyt under the other bone of
the brain pan / weken it with oil of roses / and then list the bone out
with one of the instruments standing in picture after this chaptre.

Mark pryncypally the wekenes / or feeble nes / of strength of the syke pacyent
/ if he be young or old / and what you will work on a day in a strong parson
/ that do in a feeble parson iii. ii. or. iii. days. and washed every day
with oil of roses meddled with rose honey / and with bolo armend. If the stroke
be on the place there as the heed and the brain pan is bound together / then
is the wound in peril to cut / for in that place the syne was / the brain
/ and the brain pan is bound to gyder / and that the wound changes often
times with pain / and that comes by the heuenes os ye brain / and it is the
causes of death. The wound in such a place is peryllous to hele / therefore
take not lightly upon you to take out bones / pryncypally with wekenge with
oil as is aforesaid. And when that you have taken out that bone then lay in ye
wound lynnen clothe depte. in the oil of roses meddled with rose honey / after
that the wound is great and small / and lay one clothe upon another till the
wound befull / after that lay upon the wound cotto^ depte in oil of roses /
and a little boly armeni / and therewith dress it / and lay thereupon a
couerture made of shepes skin / and been de it fast thereupon. Or help them
thus Wha^ that you have shorn of the here / tha^ dress the heed with oil of
roses warmed. The second day cut the skyn open / and fill the wound with
lynnen clothe depte in oy le of roses meddled with the yolke of eggs made warm
a little / and dress it therwt till the broken bones depart / and ever do
your dylygence and dress the heed often ty mes with defensysse unto ye time
the wound be hole. Than take he de that the pacyent may do his easement / and
that he at the first be let blood on the vain. These before said things you
must take for all dyseas of the heed from the begyn^ynge till you be sure that
no impostume come thereto / for if impostumacyon come thereto it is deedly.

Therefore ye shall know that this salve made of oil of roses and honey
cleanses all the impostumacyons of the brain / and if it be not driven away
therewith / than is ye wound deedly. And as the wound is cleanses / and the
pa^nycle above to the bray ne pan grows / than put the powd there in / for
it strength to ye brain / and makes the wound hole / and gadereth therein
fresshe flesh / and it is very good to lay thervpo^ a grene wounded plaster
/ or the plaster of master Ancelmus of Genes.

A powder.
And the powder aforesaid is made thus. Take Olthan^ Cyperi / nucis Cypressy /
Myrtillorum / Myrre / of each an ounce. ^arina Orobi. ii. ounces. all this made
in powder / and ye shall occopy it in this manner. Take a cloth and deep it in
wine / and wrynge than the wine somewhat out of the cloth than take the powder
and skatter it upon ye clothe / and lay it upon the wound.

Another manner to make powder.
Take Mumia / Dragantum / gommi Arabici / of each an ounce / sanguis Draco nis
/ farina Orobi / Myrtillorum / of each half an ounce / and hereof make a
powder for that is good in the somer / and the other aforesaid is good in
winter. And thereof ye may make also a salve with Rosy^ / wax / and oil / as
you make other salve / to know / to. xxiiij. ounces of oil / ye shall take
iiij. ounces of wax / vi. ounces of rosyn, and meddle therewith over the fire.
iij. ounces. of that powder. And if you will have the flesh to grow put
thereto this powder of nucis Ciprssi / Galle / sarine Orobi / of each an ounce.
sanguis Draconis / Mastitis / of each half an ounce. and make thereof powd

Another manner of powder
Take Litargirum / Thutia of each an ounce / Thuris / Masticis / of each half
an ounce / Mumie / Mirtilloy / Galle / Nuris cipressi / Farina orobi / of each.
iii. dragmas and thereof make a powder / and if ye wound grow rank of
flessche then cleanse it with vnguentum apostolicum secu^dum Auecen nam / and
thereupon lay oil of roses / white rose honey. If the brain be not broken /
than you need no more but dress ye heed with oil of roses and boly armeny / and
lay upon the heed a plaster made of new wax and myrtyll powder that brings
strength to the brain and defends the place that no moystnes nor swellynge
come thereto / also there is no better comfortynge to the heed / also if the
brain pan be broken or not / lay every day ye foresaid oil round about ye
wounded place unto the. x. day / and ye wyn ter unto the. viii. day / and the
pacyent may drink no wine / but barley water or water of lettuse / or of
gordes. If he before syke give him to ete hens / chekens sodden with lettuse
and with the sede of goordes / all after as he is hoot of co^plexyon / and he be
in a hoot country / than he may drink strong wine or garnappell wine / and
so rule the^. vii. or x. days / unto the time ye se ye be sure of ye
impostumacyon / and give him to ete moist flesh and motton / for the moystnes
of the flesh makes ye hardness of the braynepan and ye may give him roasted
peers / patryces / and small birds / and he may drink no wine therefore give
him water to drink with ye cromes of breed / pryncypally the parsone that is
hot of co^plexcyo^ / or be of hot country. All these aforesaid things
comforts the mawe. And if there be any parsone smyten upon the heed with a
clobbe or staff / or by reason of a fall / whereby ye braynpan is bruised and
indented and nothing parceyued in the pannycle that it is towched / ye shall
sheere of the here / and take Aloepaticu^ / sanguis Draconis / Myrra /
Olybanu^ / reed Coral / of each like much / and make in powder / and meddle it
with ye white of an egg / and make a plaster thereof / and lay it thereon till it
be hole. and if it be sore wounded do to him as I have learn you before. Thus
have I lyfted up the braynpan of. ii. children / and helped them. The one was.
iiij. years of age and was fallen from an house. And ye other was. vi. years of
age / which was hurt with a stone upon his heed / in so much yt there might
have been half an egg laid in the dynte of the brain pan / then did I shere
of the here / and because I cowlde not she re of the here in ye holownes / I
laid there upon a plaster of exicraciu^. ii. straw bread thycke stryken upon a
lether / and let it lie thereon / and in few days was the brayn pan even as it
was before / and that was not only by the workynge of the plaster / but also
by natural heete and moystnes / why che heete and moystnes causes the chyldes
heed to grow greter / which will not happen so hastily in an old parsone.

Also if one be smyten with a staff or clubbe / sword / or other wepe^ / whereof
ye person is swownynge / and yt he has so great pain yt he loses his wit /
and that his heed is swol le^ / ye shall help them thus. First let him blood
out of ye heed vain upon ye hand on ye same side there as the most pain is
/ that ye evil ylode may be taken out / or let him be let blood with ventynge or
boxynge about the neck behind / or behind the elbowe. Tha^ make a plaster
for it / of malow leaves and of where branne / of each like much sode^ together
with water / and meddled with a little old greece of a gelded bore / and make thereof
a plaster / and lay it warm upon the heed three time a day / and if it help
him not hastily / it is in doubt yt the braynpan is broken / therefore take heed to the tokens in ye. xxvij. chaptre. of the fracture of the braynpan. Than
cut the skyn open and look if the braynpan be broken / and if it be broken /
work after ye. xxix. chaptre. Cleanse the wound with vnguentu^ fuscum / or with
vnguentu^ apostolicum and un guentu^ fuscu^ of each like much / or with rose
honey / oil of roses / and the yolke of eggs / of each like much meddled
together / and thereof make a falue / and then do flesh grow in the wound with
vnguentu^ aureu^ scdm Mesue^. and stryke the salve on the lynte and lay it over
ye wound a grene wounded plaster / like as in the anthidotario I shall set.

^Herbe. vi. capytall instruments and of each other must be three mance of
sorts / great / small / and mydle syse. First there ben trappanes to make
small holes for lyftynge up ye bones / and there is of dyne^ ^haners. Galien^
makes ye Trappancs like a pers^ shers on the end and brother upward / because
ye instrument in down pressynge / fall not upon dura matter. as here shows in
pych^^e.



Also the masters of Paris makes their Trappanes in the manner here following
in figure.



They of Bonony makes after another manner their instrument like a spear.



There is. ii manners of separatory es or de partynge instruments for to depart
one hole from the other. the first is Gallicana like as here stands in figure



The other makes the of Bonony as her stands in figure.



Of that end maybe made anclenatoriu^ / or a lyftynge instrument.

The third be there eleuatoria for the departing bone to lift up / as here
shows



There is an instrument called ^ug^^ and makes the cuttynge wyder. like he^e.



There be lentirulares / and is an instrument most prayseth of Galieno / and
makes even the sharpnes of the bones which be departed / and is made like a
penneknyffe without lenticle / as here is fygured.



The. vi. is the hamer to stryke the lenticulare / which must be made of led /
for to be heavy and small / according to this figure



Of the wou^des in the face. ca. xxxvij.
With this instrument ye shall lift up again the broken brain pan / all
alter as the one part of the brain pan is be sen up ward / and the other
part downward And ye press or vyse wherewith the brain pan shall be boren
must be very sharp.



The foresaid instrument is good to work on the side of the heed / or behind
on the back of the heed.

This instrument is for in work upon the heed / when the brain pan is beten
in / for to lift it up again.



THe wounds of the face shall ye set to gydder without sowyn ge / after this
manner. Je shall take masticke / and dragons blood / and make it in powd / and
meddle them with the white of an egg till it be as thycke as honey / and therein
deep. ii. clothes the length of every side of ye wound / and lay on every
side of the wound a clowte and let it dry / the^ sow the clothes together /
and lay upon the seem this after following powder.

(...) powder.
Take dragons blood / ye lyme of egg shelles / and white franke^sence / and
lay over it towe depte in the white of an egg meddled with the same powder /
tha^^e hele it like another wound with plasters / salve / powder / or with
^awme. If it be in a flesshely place and is not possible to beholpen after this
manner aforesaid / than ye must sow it with a round nedell and a small threde
/ and if the wound be dry / it must be sowed with a square nedell. And if the
wound be shot with an arow / and ye arow heed / or pellet of a go^e be in the
body / do as the foresaid chan^re shewith of the drawing out of ye pellettes.
If it may not be / so put in ye wound oil of roses / and lay on the wound
the yolke of eggs meddled with oil of roses / and use it till the nature
prepare the way of his coming out. And it hath^en often (...) that a parson
has borne pryuely a pellet in his body a long season / and yet by ye course
of nature has comen out by himself And over all take heed that the wound in
face be not frounced.

Of the wou^des in the eyes. Ca: xxxviij.
THe wounds that happens in the eyes or the ^acou^ is great peril / because
of swellynge in the sight / and also it is ^yghe the brain / and also I have
often times seen of so small a wound coming has stopped the sight / but not
all only the wound of the eyes / but also the wound about the eyes often
times it causes the fight to fail / and if any moystnes be touched than
follows after the dystructyon of the eyes / yet have I known the contrary /
For I have seen child that on an evening by myse fortune of his fadet was
stryken with a sherpe aglet of a point in his eye / which aglet stacke in the
eye still / and afterward was taken out / and within xiiij. days after the
white of ye apple of the eye co^ne out / a spone full / than was I set to the
child / and (...) put always in the eyes this water hereafter following /
Fenyll water / Rose water Poley water / Eusrasie water / Rewe water / of each
half an ounce / and of ye white of eggs. v. dragmas / and meddled them together
/ and dressed the child there with all and recovered the sight again / In like
wise a child of. viii. years of age was hurt with a shafte in ye sterre of
his eye / that therein was fene a great web / thrughe yt which stroke he was
blind / and I did help the child with the same water that he had his sight.
In like wise speaks Galyenus of a child that he saw hurt with a sharp iron
in his eye in so much ye watery moystries came out of the apple of ye eye and
it was heled also / which cure is seldom seen. Jesus has a another manner of
cure / to came the matter to come to the eye and if there come no blood out of
the eyes / then put Tuthiam and a little Camfere unto the foresaid water. And
if there have any blood gone out / then may it be cured with Sedengi which
has the virtue so to do / and lay upon the eye where it is swollen the white
of an egg / but let it not lie long thereon / for it will take away the
sight. For I have seen a man of. xxx. years of age smyten with a stone upon the
side of ye nose thrughe which stroke the eye was greatly swollen / and there was
set a simple harbor to take that cure in hand / and so long he let a
plaster lie thereon that ye man lost his sight and was blind ever after.
Benemirus prayseth sore in this behalf the white of eggs ground in a mortar
as in manner of a faiue / and in this substancye so made is great virtue given
by the might of god.

Also if any person be wounded thrughe the upper lyd or nether lyd of the eye
that it hang down / then shall ye with subtylte sow up the sore with a
crooked nedell and a sylke threde waxed that the eye may swell the less / lay a
plaster made with the white of an egg and meddle therewith a little dragon blood
with frankensence and look that the plaster touch not the eye / and ye shall
make it as hole as the other eye / or also to balsome and that it come not in
the eye: and drop in the eye always the foresaid water for the defending of
that. Also if there come any thing in the eye yt greueth him / as small stones
or cha^^e / or by (...) / to drive away the pain ye shall (...) in ye eye
woman's milk or fair s^^te water for that cleanses out that ye (...) therein /
and if that help not / turn ye eye lydde and take a sylke cloth and therewith
cleanse it on^ / or with a small roll made of cotton / and if it hold fast in
the eye / draw it out with a small roll of rosell and drop therein woman's
milk of a wenches^ turn the eye lydde then take ye little white stone of a
swalowe and put it in the eye and it will run about the eye / and cleanse it
/ and if it be the fylynge of ^ron take up the lyd of the eye and hold before
it a stone called Magnete and that will draw it out. Also if there be any
passon (...) with an arowe or with any other wepen in ye eye wherein is gre^yll.
Nevertheless go^ forth a^ ma^^t of ways with the faiue of oil of roses so
long as none inpos^^^ macyon nor swellynge comes thereto / after that mark
how deep the arowe he^^ is in. Then work after the chapter of the drawing
out of the arowe. And when ye arowe is out fill the wound with oil of roses
meddled with the yolke of eggs some what warm / and cleanse the wound with
rose h^ny / barley meele / and meele of fenne creke / and then make flesh in
the wound and hele it with a grene wounded plaster^ or with a moist plaster.
There stands in Antithodorie / that if the arowe heed abide therein / ye (...)
work after the chapitre of the heed / and if the wound have need to be made
wide / work after the chapter of narowe wounds and make it with a year of a
sponge / and if the wound be great (...)ghe / work after the chapter of
drawyng out of a row heedes / or let it abide within till ye time it come out
by the own nature. For wylhelmes says yt he has seen apson bear in his face
an arow heed an hole year long / which came out by his own nature / and than
the wound was cured in such manner as is aforesaid of ye wound in ye face /
Also if there any parson be hurt in ye eye with a nedel / or with a thorn /
work as I have said before of ye defe^sinu^ to noynte about the ^yen / and
hele it with this colerion following. Take Boli armeni. ii. ounces / Thutia /
sanguis Draconis / Gu^miarabici / of each an ounce / and make all in powder /
and meddle it with. xxiiij. ounces of rose water / and put it all in a glass /
and hang it in warm water an hour long / then do thereto. iii^. ounces of
garnat appell wine / and let it stand a day long / and than clear it out /
there of put at every time a little in the eye at ye evening and morning /
and lay thervpo^ this plaster / take succy / semperuiue / succy solatry of
each. iii^. ounces boly armeni / draganti myrte / gommi Arabici of each. iii^.
dragmas and make thereof a powder / and if ye can not get ye say of house leke
/ take therefore rose water and take for nyghshew ye wine of the garnate apple /
this water heleth all ye wou^des of the eyes plaster wise laid over it with
clothes / and it defends the eyes from superflue moystes and evil accedent
or in postume. When the blood comes in the eyes from ye wound after shesus
saying take thereto the milk of a young woman and the white of an egg and the
blood of a down taken out of the wings / and meddle all this together and drop
it in to ye eye and lay thereupon a plaster made of breed cromes wette in wine /
but let it not lie long that is very good / and if yt go not a way / tha^ drop
in ye eye water of Amios / salge^me / and so me^tere / ye eye with dressynge of
order / and dry ^sope / if it drive it not away / take fair water wherein has
stand ^eed arsenicum / Or take the waters of ye herbs a foresaid. ii. ounces
/ Thutie preparati half a dragma / Coralli rubei / margaritaru^ uon parforata^
/ of each yt third part of a dragma Camfere the wayght of. x. barley corns /
draganti go^me arabici of each ye wayght of. viij. barley corns ^eru^e lote /
amidi of each the wayght of. v. barley corns / Woman's milk / ye white of an
egg / of each a dragma / and meddle the^ together and occupy it at e^e^ / and at
morning till ye parsone be hole.

For the wound of the eeres Ca xxxviij b.
IF any is wounded by ye eere or in ye ete wherein is sear yt the brain be
hutte or ye baynes of ye herynge it is in great peril and dedly for if ye
bryane be perisshed it is deedly / And if ye synewes be perysshed ye lo^geth to

and yt he give knowlegyng to his fre^des. And if ye wound be great and sore /
sow it and lay thereupon ye powder of ye lyme of egg shelles frankencens
dragons blood and say about ye wound a defensuiu^ and thereupon towe depte in

ye second ^^ ^^yrde day lay in ye wound oil of roses meddled with the yolke of
an egg / for slakynge of the pain / ye other day after / ye shall cleanse the
wound with rose honey barley melt. termenty ne / sometime meddled with myr^a / and
sarcocolle / after the wound is needful to be cleansed / or hele it with a
grene wounded plaster / or with bawme / and rule him with blood ^ettynge / and to
chamber going / for ye less coming of swellyng or spostumacio^* If the
wound with shot take heed of the arow how depeit is gone in / for ye
pacyent may come lightly to chau^gyng in ^brakinge and shaking with a crampe /
and it is a token of death / and with that token is his eyes reed / therefore it
is peryllous to take such a wound in hand. If you will do it ^^rough great
desire or other causys / tha^ tell his fryendes all the tokens and condycyons /
that ye will not take him in hand but for a deedman / than make the wound
wide / as I have showed you before / and de fend the place with defensiuum /
than pull out the arow heed with your tonggys / as is aforesaid in the. xvi.
chaptre / than cle^se the wound like as is aforesaid / and make flesh to
grow / and hele it like another wound / ^cule him like as is aforesaid / and
let him drink no wine / there is nothing that hurtyth the brain and the
veins of herynge so fore as the wine does / therefore it is very good that the
person that is wou^dyd in the heed beware him of wine drinking.

woundynge of the synewes which his beginning takes on the side of ^^cha.
Therefore is said / as the wound is deep to ye reuersyue synewes so shall he

sow it deep in the cuttynge of the wound / and thervpo^ lay the powder
aforesaid of the eggs shelles / and than there vpo^lay the ground worms
sta^ped and meddled as it is before said in the. xiiii. chaptre. If the great
veins be wounded it is in doubt if the blood may be stop or not / if the
wound shall be held or not / and if that person shall dye or not but stop
the blood with sowynge of the vain so it may best be done. and than make
thereupon a plaster of this epythimia / that Galienus set in quinto Therapentis.
and take Fra^kensence one part / Aloes half a part and make it to gyder in

dress it as I have said in the. xv. chaptre, of the stoppynge of the blood. If
ye wound is behind through the bone that ye back mary be wounded / it is very
ill. therefore take not to cure such a wound. If ye be desired to such a
workynge / sh^^ tell the friends that it is a deedly wound / Nevertheless do
your best. And in the beginning put therein warm oil of roses / and say
thereupon oil of roses medlyd with the yolke of an egg / so it less the pain /
and as it begin to matter / so shall it be clensyd and make flesh with this

stryke it on a clothe / and say it on ye ^ucha or back mary / and it shall be
better (...) ye master or surgya^ think it un(...) / but it is not i^possible
to ye nature as she may be helped with the strength of ye good medysyne and
clensynge. If the wound be long / and the bone wounded / and any pieces be cut
of / so need you it to take out / if it be possible / than sow ye wound like
as I have showed before / and cleanse it and heel it like an other wound / and
if the botton of the back bone is cut through / or ye back bone by the neck /
so as he has lost his meuynge / so it is in peril to help him. If it be not
lost / help him with the strength and clensynge of the rose honey / torpentyne
/ fenigreke meel / and thereof make a plaster / and lay it on the wound / and
about the wound shall ye stryke defe^suru^ / and hele it like an other wound
/ If the wound be through the throat goll / it is great peril / because i^.
veins is in it / the which veins comyth to the loungis / and to the heart. As
they be wou^dyd that is in great peril and dedly / and hereof wrytheth
wilhelnius de saliceto / that he saw a great lord was shotten in one of ye
aforsayd veins by the throwte goll / there went out one drop of blood / in
co^tynent the lord dyed / and the place of the wound was black / and he
rattylde so sore till he dyed / thereby understood wilhelmes that the blood
ran to ye lou^ges / and to ye heart stoppynge his brethe / and wilhelmes mind
was to leet him blood on both his armies / but the time was to short for him /
therefore it is good in such a wound the pacyent to be let blood / Also he
saw a knight that was hurt in ye neck with a long knyffe that the throwte
goll was wou^dyd / and he fill down and lay still / and wilhelmus thought he
had be deed / because he felyd no wind come from him / and he halpe him that
he came to life / Also he saw a presoner in the town of Tremo^de / which of
disperacyon cut his one throwte / that his meet came out again through the
wound and his brethe / than bound he again the parts of the wound well
fast together / and laid there upon this powder.

Take dragantum / sanguis draconis / gumy arabici / of each like much in
powder / with this defensyffe powder / and plumacyoles or small kussyus of
clouthes or of roywe / and with the byndynge thereto at lenkth / he was helyd in
a month. Is the wound in this pertys aforsayd / with a shote of an arowe or
stytche with a dagger / and the arowe in the wound / then take it out softly
as is aforsayd in the xvi. chaptre. If the arowe be taken out / and bleded sore
/ then stope it as I have said in the xiiii. chaptre. And bled it but little /
or is there no pain the^ heed the with (...) unto (...) (...) wound upon yt ye
may (...) con^ pai^^ or not If there been pain (...) may ye (...) wound. But
is there pay^^ (...) (...) the^ it is needful to fylle the hole wound with
warm oil of roses / and put therein (...) t^ll re^te deyed before in warm
oil of rofes meddled with the yolke of tyges / and (...) therewith (...) wound
open unto the time yt matter comeout. The^ cle^se it like another wound / and
hele it with a grene wounded plaster / or with bawme. Some time the wound is
shoten through the neck and towched the throwte goll called hysophagus / and
trachea / but the synewes and veins be not towched / then need none other cure
than the cure of another wound.

Of the wound i^ the schulders or between the schulder Ca. xlij.
IN this places to be wounded it is very peryllous / for the synewes which
come from the brain / therefore it is dedly after the wound is deep or not
deep. Mark al so if the wound is in the length or overthwart. And is the
wound wide then sow it / and let in the nedermost end a hool open where
through the matter may avoid out / yt the wound may be cle^se / and lay upon
the seem this powder folowinge.

A powder.
Take drago^s blood / gu^me of arabie / and dragantum and make it in powder. If
the wound be not depethe^ hele it with ye grene wounded plaster / or with
bawme like another wound. If the wound be deep and you be fered for the pain
of the synewes / then lay first in the wound oil of roses meddled with yolke
of eggs. Thereafter lay on every day a clensynge plaster. as I have wry then
in the a for said last chaptre / and is made o^rofe honey / barley meel / and
sometime with turpe^tyne / myrra / sarcocole. and about the wound stryke a
defensyffe / made of bolo armeno / oil of roses and with a little venegre. And
as the wound is well clensyd / then do flesh grow. and thereafter hele yt
like another wound. If ye wound be shot and that the pelleth or arowe head is
in it / then make the wound greter / and take out ye pelleth or arowe head as
I have said in ye xvi. chaptre. wha^ ye arow head or pelleth is pulledout /
then put in the wound oil of roses meddled with the yolke of eggs / and all
times stryke the wound about with ye defensyffe as is aforesaid / and the next
day cleanse the wound. If in the wound growed corrupt flesh / then cleanse
it with un guentu^ apostolicu^ scdm Auicenna^. And it is well cle^seth / then
hele it. And all time hold the rule with lettynge of blood / and to the chamber
going / and with mete and drink / and with myxed wine / after the dysposycyon
and after the co^plexcyon of the wounded parsone.

Of the wound of the sholds and uppermost part of the arm above theelbow. ca.
xliij
THis wound is in sundry manners. sometime is the shulder wounded above
ouerthward sometime in the length. sometime the arm above ye elbowe is wounded
out the are sometime in ye length. sometime is ye wound small and through the
skyn^e / and some is a great wound through the skyn^e and flesh. sometime ye
synewes is wounded / sometime ye veins / sometime arteries / sometime the muscls
/ sometime the bones / or the hole pype therewith. And this happenyth / sometime
with a sword / sometime with a dagger / and sometime with shot. All this wou^des
must you know to bind in sundry manners because it is a membre that is much
occupied / and needful to the body / and to al occupacyons of crafts.
Therefore remember well how you shall bind such a wound like as it nedyth.
If any be wounded ouertwhart in ye arm / tha^ it is fere that (...) long
muscles or lacertes is wounded and the synewes that comes from the heart in
the arm / and it is to fear that the hand of the same arm shall have no more
power and that membre shall lose his meuynge / if the arm be hole or not. The
losing of his meuynge comes sometime by the wou^dynge of arteries and veins
there as ye blood may not be stoppyd to the will of the surgean. If any be
wounded with an instrument that stiched and falls upon the synewes or bounds
by the muskly flesh there is to fere for coming of the crampe / and thereafter
the death. As the pain comes in the wounded place / than goth it forth through
the hole place upward in the brane / and so brings the synewes and bounds to
putre faccyon with ye evil matter And there falls often times great pain in
the wou^des. iij. finger broad benethe the shulder / and. iij. finger broad
above and benethe the elbowe there as the long muscles is / and there the
synewes be bare / of ye which aforesaid pain comes ye crampe / and through
the crampe comes the death. As the wound is of length in the uppermost arm
that sto^deth on the shulder / such a wound is not peryllous. If any be hewn
through the shulder to the dysme^brynge of the arm and ye arm hangs / it is
needful to be well sowed / because the arm is great and heavy / and than lay
thereupon towe deped in ye (...) of eggs / therein mydled with a little of the
powder made of gum of arabie / dragantum / dragons blood / thau bind and
hele it like another wound / and bind an hard kusshyn under the arm. Or
make him a croutche there with to lift up ye arm so hye as it is possible. Is
the wound over twhart that the synewes and other veins is wounded / than
shall it be sowed / and the pain be taken away / as I have saydin ye. xiiij.
chaptre. If ye said veins be sore blodynge / than work with the stoppynge of
the blood / and with sowynge of the synewes as I have learned in the. xv.
chaptre. And ye pacyent shall be defendyd from the pain yt the pacyent may
rest the better / and altyme stryke about the wound with the defensyuum of
bolo armeno / olium rosarn^ / and venegre / and lay on the seem that powder of
franke^sence / drago^s blood / lyme of egg shelles / and white of an egg /
and with plumacyoles / like as it is aforesaid of ye other wounds. And has
the wound but little bloded / so let him blood on the veins / or with
ventoses or boxces / after the pacyent is strong / and defend the wound with
ye desensyuu^ / and hold him to the draugthgoynge / that to ye wound come not
impostumacyo^ nor swellynge (...) I have (...) before. If the synewes or
muscles be he^ through / then sow it with a wax dread and oil of roses /
that thereto come no pain / and after bind and cle^se it with mu^dificatyffe
that bel^nthe to the synewes.

A mu^dificatyffe.
Take myrra / sarcocolle / turpentyn / honey of roses / but this mundificatyffe
shall not be laid in the wound unto the time yt you be sure that no
impostumacion come thereto Therefore take the rule of bloodietynge / (...) with all
things as is aforesaid. In thi^ place for shyftynge and sowynge of the ^wes
will not slake lightly ye pain / whereby the uppermost member is the febler /
^che synewes was vsyd to serve him / than it is needful the stytchynge or
poynture to hold open / and fill the hole wound with oil of roses / and yolke
of eggs / of ye same lay on the wound. If in this place to the wound come a
hot impostume / then do as I have learned in the chaptre of the rulyng. And if
there come blodynge with the todoynge of the oil and the yolke of the eggs
for taki^ge away the pain / like wise if ye will staunche the blood with drynes
whereof comes ye pain / and if you lay therein ye oil and the yolke of eggs
that cause the bloodynge. For all that ye must stau^che ye blood and take the
pain away / therefore it were good that the end of the vain with hot yro^ be
fered / as I have learn you in yt. xv. chaptre. and the Iron shall not towche
the lyppes of the wound. And tha^ lay shortly there on the oil of roses and ye
yolke of eggs for to take awayethe pain. If any parsone is wounded above the
elbowe through the bone / the^ sow it / and keep the sowynge with this
afterfolowynge powder.

A powder.
(...) of egg shelles / dragons blood why^e frankensence all made in powder /
and^owe depedin the white of an egg as another wound. Than shall you ye arm
spl^nt^ to the wound so less as yeinaye / and that she may have ease that the
wound take no heet / that there come non impostume nor swellynge. To the bones
which were brokenor cutteth through / Idede make a holowe pype of wood / in the
length of a spa^e and a half long. and cloven in the length in twain
lymynge the one side together with a clowte / and ye other side open like a
lantern / and therein I laid ye arm with byndynge about / and in the pype I
made an hole against the wound / that the arm or leg may be in surte / and
I left the pype thereon so long till the time I took of the bound /
nevertheless I dressyd the wound every day as there to belo^gth. And I deed
more profit with the pype than I deed with ye splynttes. Somtymeleft I ye pype
cou^red within with askyn^e / and therouer a lynnen clothe / for to occupy the
lesser bounds / for the multitude of baundes comes ready hootnes and
impostumacyon / and there again I occupye all time that desensyffe / and on the
contrary side I let blood and keep him with good rule / as is aforesaid. If
the wound be shot / then pull it outlyke as I have learned you in ye chaptre of
pulling out of the arowe heed. and there after cleanse the wound / and defend
it from pain as it nedyth. If an impostumacyon comes to such a wound / it
is great yeopardy / or deedly / nevertheless help him in this manner. his meet
shall be pap of sterche sodden with barley water / or with lettuse water / or make
him a cawdel of almondes / and give hi^ wine of garnat apples / or agros medlyd
with water. If he may not do his easement then make him a purgacyon. If he be
syke and feeble / or has long lay and be^ then give him young chyckens to eet
dressyd with the aforesaid erbes. Then cleanse the wound / and hele it with
the grene wounded plasteror Jews plaster.

A plaster for to make ripe an impostumacyon.
Take the root of long malowes the ryne of the root / and make it clean /
and cut it in little pecys sodden and sta^ped to ye wayght of an ounce and half
an ounce. fenigfeke meell / lynsede meell / ofeche. vi. ounces. dyll sede /
camomyll flowers / ofeche. ij. ounces. hogs greece so much as it nedid / and
meddle it together on the fere and make thereof a salve / and lay it warm upon ye
impostume / If he may not suffer the plaster / than take oil of roses / boly
armeni / venegre / a little opium thebaicum / semen Jusquiami / this small beten
/ and lay there upon till the pain be gone. then make it ripe / and then
cleanse it / and do flesh grow / and hele it.

Of the wound i^ the elbow, ca, xliiij
IN the wounds in the elbowe and about the elbowe is great Jeopardy / for ye
great vayues and synewes that be therein / for the blood is ill to staunce / and
not only the stoppynge of blood / but also to defend ye wound from the pain
/ or swellinge / or impostume / and a part of the crampe / for nyghe being of
the muscles / which be (...). (...) fyngers is above and b^the the ^^bow / and
also for the bo^rs (...) the ^teyngys / and the vaynys that is within ye elbo
(...) they bring in much moystnes that is in the place closyd / for that can
not be so cle^syd perfectly as it nedyth / and through such hoot^es of ye
matter / the feeling be lost Therefore take heed to stop ye blood of such a
wound / and defend the arm upward and downewarde / for to coming of
moystnes that makyth a postomacyon / and swellynge. If than the wound be wide
and long / it shall be sowyd as I before have said / and thee upon that powder
of lyme of eggs shellys. If the veins be wou^dyd so shall you bind it like
as in the xiiii. chaptre is said / and do it in likewise if there were pain /
and over the byndynge shall be laid a clothe iiij. do^b^e depte in warm wine /
and therein is soden the e^be of mowseere / reed mother wort / or a^them^sia

the arm ha^ge with the board in a fouwel berynge on the neck / and bind the
arm every time on heyght / that the arm may be the quicker / and the pacyent
may not much goonor sto^de / because through such bangynge of the arm should
come much blood thereof the arm should swell. Therefore command him to abide
still / and to this wound is nothing better / tha^ to hold ye rule of ye
wound in the ioynture / as hyer after ye shall ler (...). If in ye elbow be an

whereby ye may have out ye arow heed / tha^ fulfill the wo^de with (...) led
with the yolke of eggs / or (...) the whyt of eggs. and then cleanse the
wound with a mundifica^^nd / as I shall ^^me you here after in Antithodario.
As ye be sure of the impostumac^on or swellynge / than do flesh to grow if
it is of need / and than hele the wound with ye grene ^^^ded plaster or Jews
plaster / or with ^awine.

Of the Wou^des in the joints shulders elbowes / hyppis / knees / and of the
glyttynge water. Ca. xlv.
When such a wound comes to you / if it be in the shulders / elbow / hyppys
hands / fyngers / knees / anclowes / and toes / and you fear for the
superflue moystnes or accyde^tes that may come there to. Than at the first ye
must mark if the pacie^t be full of fles^he and superflue moystnes / or full
of blood. Than ye must mark if the wound be great or small / deep or not or
hewe^ / or stytcheth with a dagger / or with a sword / or with shot / or ye
stytchyng be open or closyd. And ye must mark if the wound has bleded much
or little. Ilso ye must mark if the wound is in a place there as the synewes
/ veins / arteries / or muscles be. And also ye must mark if the wound is in
ye length / or ouertwhart / or in a joint or membre that is much occupied / as
the elbowe / or knees / to the which ioynte comes the most gretest pain of
the great moystnes that there be sounde^ of the nature. Also ye must mark or
ye pacye^t is obedyent or not / and if ye must take heed of him or not / and
out of this points ye must take ye cure of this sykenes / and the cure is to
be done in iiij. manners / The first through good rule of meet and drink / and
of slepynge and waking and of good rest / whereby the nature may be strength
for to put away all such sykenes. The second is / through taking away ye
moystnes and the blood / and that must be done with purgacyo^s glyster
lettynge of blood / or with setting with boxces / and going to the draught /
and ye contrary deele rubbing or byndyng. The iij. is with dryuynge backwart /
and restryngynge ye curse of the blood / and moystnes / and to strength the
member. The iiij. is with ye consumynge of ye matter. And this is to be done
with soft making of the wound / and of the helynge of the veins / or
synewes or the member / through such defe^dynge slaked the superflue moystnes.
Af any body be wou^dyd in a joint or nyghe by a ioynte / that you fere that the
glyttynge water should come out / If than the pacyent be yo^ ge / and full of
blood and full of flesh and of moystnes / than ye must preserve him of much
eethynge and drinking / and let him eete no fles^he nor eggs nor of no
slymynge fysshe / nor meet made with spicery / and let him drink no wine / but
he shall be content with pap of otes / or barley / or rise / or of almo^ milk made
with brenne water / and thereof made soppys / but little / he may eete small
birds / and of young gootes / of all this a little / If he be syke / give him
young cheke^s / but a little / his drink shall be barley water / or a little Agros
meddled with water / and thereof he shall drink but little two times in a day if
he can do it / he shall wake on the day for that he may sleep the better in
the night / he shall the membre bynethe the wound lay hyer than the wound /
werby he may ye better rest / and if that he may not well sleep / than stryke
on the place under the eere / and on the betynge vain / and the hands and on
the nose thrylles with this salve.

A salve.
Take vnguentu^ populeu^ half an ounce / olei ma^dragore one dragma / opei
thebaici halta dragma / Corticis ma^dragore one scrupyll / croci / cassie ligne
/ of each half a scrupyll / cere. modicu^ aceri quod sufficit. fiat vnguentum
secondu^ artein. The other shall ye mark if he have course and unclean blood
/ than meddle his drink with burrage water / with water of fumus terre / and with
^nscute water / or side water growing in the flexce / If he has much blood
/ and ye wou^dyd vain has blooded a little / than let him blood on ye other
side that ye b^ de may be takyn from the other wo^ membre / and would the
pa^y^^t ^o (...) let / than set him nevertheless (...) (...) boxys without
flemynge / if the (...) may not be set than in a bathe than ^ube and bind on
the other side / as I shall say in the next chaptre Item ye shall also take heed that he every day gothe to the draught onys a day at leest / and if he
(...) (...) of himself / so make it him with suppositories.

If the body be full of materies and of heet / than pure it with purgacy on
made by the pottykaryr / that the body may be puryfyed / and that the moystnes
of the wound be alteryd through another way.

A purgacyon.
And that shall be given him with sycore water / and with borage water / fenicle
water / and the aforsayd reecpte is made all thus. Take Cassie fistule elect
nouiter extracte. vi. ounces. Dyaprimis solute. iiij. ounces. Syrupi violati /
misces in forma liquida. or give him this purgacyon that is a little stronger
for coming to sooner to ye laxacyon.

A purgacyon.
Take Diacolycon. iij. ounces. elect de sue co rosarum. ii. ounces. and misce.
If he be syke or feeble / and so stopped / that you darre not give him ye
purgacyo^ / or that he will take not the purgacyon / tha^ make this glyster.

A Glyster.
Take ye erbe of Uyolette / herbam Mercuxialis / ^. malowe or pappyl / hye
Malowe / Beta romana / of each half an ha^defull. water. vi. pound. this
letbe sodde^ to gyder till ye third part be consumed. than take of it. xii.
ounces. and do thereto Honey of vyolettes half an ounce. Oil. iij. ounces.
small rubbyd salt. ii. ounces.

The third. defend the member for ye toro^nynge blood and moystnes coming to
the wound / and strength the membre that it may res^^ynge and enforcyd
backewart ye moystnes. And this shall be done with repercussyues and defensynes
with saluynge in the morning and in the eueninge / as often as ye dress the
wound. And in the beginning of your dressynge that vpperparte of ye wounded
membre roundaboute almoost iij. palm in the length / above and benethe the
wound. iiij. twhartfyngers broad from the wound. upon the wound and
roundabout shall be laid warm things as I shall say. And that defensyffe ye
shall have every time by you / for cause without that defensyuum may not good
surgean be / which all lernydmen of this conning occupied in all causys for
all other defensyues restrinynge the moystnes and other ill accide^tes

An excellent Defensyffe
Take oil of Roses. iiij. ounces. Boli arm ni. ii. ounces. Terre sigillate /
venegre / of each an ounce. ^amfer a dragma. Nyghtschawe / howsleke of each an
handful / there out stamp and press the sap / an with all this same make a
salve / and occupye it as is aforesaid / and as I have learned.

The fourth. Ye shall on the wound and about the wound lay things softynge
ye wound / and to brenge it to matter / and to take away the pain of the
veins. The veins to hele and to dress withtentes it is in two manners. the
one is better than ye other. The one is with warm and moist making of the
wound. the other is with cold and dryenge and consumynge of the moystnes. but
all the doctors occupye ye first with the warming / al be it also that the
doctors whryten not of this sykenes / but alone of the discrasya / impostume /
cut tynge / and stytchynge in the synewes / veins / arteries / as I have
learned you. And this happened more in small wounds tha^ in great wounds / and
pryncypally in the wounds that be stytchyth / and for that ye small wounds
has not bleded / and ye blood comes to the wound and may not out wherefore
the synewes / veins arteryes / comyth to the more pain / not only because of
the blood / but also of the smalnes of the wound that the medesyne may not
come in it for the ^^akynge of ye pain of the wounded veins. Therefore it were
very good to cut greter the small wounds that ye drynes may come in it. And it
is also my counsel / and I have found in it much prolyte.

One anoyntyng.
Take Oil of roses. one ounce. small rubbyd salt. half an ounce. and dry
ground worms in powder. a dragma and a half this well hot mydled to gyder /
and therein deep cotton / and lay that upon the wound so warm as he may
suffer it. and over the cotton lay a four dowble old lynne^ clowte depeth in
warm wine of the best that ye can get to the waygthe of. ii. pound and a
half / therein is sodden these erbes / mowscere with the yelowe flowers or
Auricula muris in latyu / herba Candela stondynge in herbario / Arthemisia /
Beta romana / of each an handful / and deep therein the bound / byndynge
therewith the member / and keep ye rule which often I have learned you.

Will you help ye pacient well and hastly / than he must suffer the wound
greter to be cut / and than do as I have aforesaid in ye xvi. chaptre. If he
will not suffer it / than work with the medecynes aforsayd till he be hole. If
ye have made the wound wyder or is it wide Inowgh of himself / tha^ put therein
warm oil of roses / therein is sodde^ the long ground worms / and it
strensed again through a clothe. And there over ye shall lay cotton deped in
this afterfolowynge recepte and anoyntemente made thus.

A Recepte.
Take ground worms not dried and grafartysses / which is found under the
old moysty stones / of each an ounce / this stamp to gyder meddled with. ii.
ounces oil of roses made of lynseedoyle / that shall ye make as hot as he
may suffer it. There over lay plumacyoles or small cusshyns made of towe or
lynnen clothe and than bind it. If the wound be great / wide / and deep that
there any veins or synewes be wounded / tha^ shall you sow it as I have learned
you in the. xii. chaptre. and put in the wound oil of roses sodden with the
ground worms mydled with the yolke of eggs / and there over lay the recepte
aforsayde of the gra^artysses. and. and do thereto an ounce turpentyne / and
bind it in all manners as I right now have learned you. This. iij. byndynges
shall you do. viii. or x. days long till ye be sure of the impostu macyon /
swellynge / and of other ill accide^tes / and that shall ye know by ye ronnynge
out of the matter / and by the dysposycyon of that wounded membre / and hold
al times the (...) aforsayd / of etyng / drynkyng / slepyn and to do his
easament by him self / or purgacyon And than hele the wound like another
wound shall be helyd.

The other manner
When that glydtynge water ronnyth out ye must dry and stop the moystnes.
and wasshe the wound with mannys water / Or put the ground worms in a glass
and stop it well / and wind that glass round about in thowgh / and set it in
an oue^ with other breed / / and with that water that comyth of the ground
worms ye shall wasshe the wound / and thereto is better ye water that is
found between the shulders of an oxce. And as the wound is washed put therein
this powder herafter following.

A powder.
Take Bolus armeni / read Myrre / white Fra^ke^cense / Mastick / Drago^s blod /
Greeks pyche / of each like much / and this all together make in powder.

A plaster.
And then make this recepte / Take bolo armeni / an ounce. reed alom half an
ounce. and white of eggs as much as is Inowgh and thycke as honey / and stryke
it like a plaster and lay it therouer. Or take this recepte here after
following.

A salve.
Take bolus armenus an ounce and a half. reed alom an ounce. stuf meel of a
myll half an ou^c. wheete meel a dragma. and white of eggs so much as is
Inowgh / and thy^ke as honey / and keep the rule as it is before said. It
happens sometime yt the wound is helyd / and the seuerynge or glydtyng water
laid about ye joints / and ye ioynte waxed great as a ma^nys heed / and the
skyn abides hole as another skin / and these moystnes must be consumed in
this manner.

A purgacyon.
First with the purgacyo^ of pillule hermodactuly / or with pyllule fetidis.
The second lay thereupon without that dries and consumes / and lay it
plasterwyse over the joint at evening and morning / and it must well be
bound with a long rollynge bau^de. and shall be made in this manner.

A plaster.
Take Oil of olyue. xxiiij. ounces. Draga^ tu^ / Mastick / Go^mi arabici / of
each. ij. ou^. Boli armeni. iiij. ounces. roots of ambra / or consolide
maioris / all together stamped pure and fine / and do thereto white of eggs well
betyn / then occupye it as is before said. If ye will / do thereto Licium /
Accricia Alumen zuccarinum / ofeche half an ounce.

Of the wou^des between the elbowe and the handys. Ca. xlvi.
THis wound is not so great peril as is above the elbow / for all that the
long muscles is there. iij. twhart fyngers down ward ye elbow there ye
synewes and stryngys be bare / that oftentimes makyth great pain / and through
the cramp comet the death / this happynyth more in the wound above the elbow.
Of the wound benethe the elbow is small with out lesynge of the substance /
than shall the wound be bound after that xij. chaptre. If the wound be
length ye arm or over twhart that it must be sowyd / than work and bind it
after the. xiiij. chaptre. In like wise do to the wound that is stytched. If
the arm be through cut / than shall you sow it like as another wound / and
shall be laid in one pype / or in splenttys / and in a touwell ha^gyd / as it is
said in the. xliiij. chaptre / and if the pacyent be not with a pype bound / but
with splentes / than lay ye arm on a board / and between the board and the
arm with a kusshyn fylde with hey / and in the winter fylde it with fedders /
the hey is for colynge / and the fedders for warmnes / the pacye^t shall hold
in his hand a round ball / or a round stafe upon the board stondynge vpryght
If the wound be in such a membre / there as many veins come together /
pryncypally ye pulse or betynge vain / than take heed if the vain has much
blood or not / and has she not bled Inowghe / than do after the. xv. chaptre.
Bleed the wound so much that you can not so ^^ it / than bind the arm above
the wound as I you have learned in the. xiii. chaptre. and that blood shall
you staunche after the learning w^^e. xv. chaptre. And than shall ye unbind the
baunde from it / and lay the arm so h^e that ye wound hangs not / and that
the arm lay hyer than the elbowe.

A very good experimente to staunche blood.
If the wound will not leave his bledynge / then take heed of this learning.
For I Jeron was called to one that was wounded above the wreste of the hand /
and the servant of a harbor has so wen it. I asked the pacye^t if he had
blede much or not he said nay / then I let the wound to be bounden to the
next day / and than ye wound bleded again. ye. iij. day, I vnbou^de ye
wound / than came the blood sharply out / than bound I the wound hastly
again / but the blood ran out nevertheless / than I bound on the vain a
blood stone / as it is lernyd in the. xv. chaptre. The one part of the blood
stone deed I be thyn in powder and that meddle I with the white of the eggs and
towe therein I depte / and I bound it on the wound / and therewith was the
vain stau^chyd that there no drope of blood ^am out / and than laid I the arm
on a board / and shortly came that blood in the arm so plentefull that the
arm of himself lift up. Than laid I my hand on the arm to hold it stedly
/ forall that it lift up under my hand. Than bau^de I the other arm above the
hand that the hand was blewe / and after that the blood came in the arm that
not was hurt / and tha^ the wounded arm lay still on the board / and when I
saw that the byndynge should hurt the hole h^ than I lose a little the bo^^de
and so lene I the handesom days bounden not to ^as^. And as I ye wounded arm
vnbo^de for to dress than I bound the other hand for the time the harder and
for cause the wound was staunched. viiij. days. I left the hole hand
vnbonde / and I should dress ye wound / and anon bledeth ye wound again /
than bound I again the hole arm very hard / and therewith was ye wound
stoppyth: Therefore take heed wha^ ye se such^ a wound than bind the contrary
part as I have lernyd you in ye. xv. chap.

Another experymentall lernyng for to staunche the blood.
Also was I called to a young man which was stytched through his leg above
his knee / to the which was called another master before / which thereto deed
a good staunchynge of blood / nevertheless the wound bleded still / and I
desire not to come there / for cause of ye master / but I mark that the
pacyent became febler and fayn tha^ I set the aforsayde stone / and in the
mean time dread I stamp small netyll And I cause the other master to unbind
the wound / and anon came ronnyng out of ye wou^dyd vain a finger thick
blood. Tha^ I laid on the vain in the wound ye blood stone and that powder of
the same blood stone mydled with the white of eggs / and ye powder thus mydled
laid I round about the bloodstone / and tha^ I bound there upon on the wound
the stamped small netylles and than I bound it with a rollynge bound that
there came not out one dropell of blood. All be it so that a master laid the
afor said bloodestone on a woundid vain / nevertheless it will not stop nor
stau^che ye blood / like wise as it has happens me. And shor^ly I clean and
shruped the stone and th^^ I laid it on the wound and tha^ he showed his power
as thereto belongthe. Therefore it is good to have ye stone in powde^ th^^ to lay
the^ upon ye wound and veins.

Of the wound of the hand and the fyngers. Ca. xlvij.
THese wounds be not so deedly as the wound in the elbow Nevertheless thereto
comes often times impostumacyon and swellynge / therefore take heed if it neded
to be sowed the wound / tha^ work after the. xiij. chaptre. and bind it like
another wound. If the wound is with shot / than take out the pellet like as
it showed before in the. xvi. chaptre. If the wound has bled but little /
Than let him blood as is said in the. xv. chaptre. If there be great pain of
the wound / and the pain will not slake then make this after following
remedy.

A medecyne.
Take boli armeni. ii. ounces. oil of roses iiij. ounces. opium. xl. barley

times till the pain be slaked / but not long for the coldemakynge of the
membre. And hele the wound like another wound. If after ye helynge of ye
wound come there small bollynge or knottes that ye ioynte may not be vowen
than shall ye lay^on the knotten every day this plaster following.

Of the wound in the breast, Ca, xlviij.
OF the wounds in the breast how they happened / speaks Gwido ye meruaylyd
him that he has found whr yten so little of Galieno / Haly abbate / and
Aniceu na / of ye members that be holden / and much is whryten of the me^bres
which holden / and in these happened the wounds in sundry manners / and
therefore ye must have also so^dry cures / thereafter as they be. It is sometime
done with a sword / or with a dagger / or with a shot / or with a spear through
ronnyng. Sometime is wou^ did the vttermoost skin and the flesh. sometime in
the holnes of the breast. sometime through ye body. Sometime is wounded the
members within the body / like as the heart / / the longues / and dyafragma /
that is the pa^nicle that departs the heart from the other members. And
sometime is not towched ye membrys within / tha^ it is but a simple wound. And
this is needful to be known of this particyon to the surgean / that he may
the better do her cure. And because that the old doctors in this cure
accordyth not / therefore I shall whryten some what for to know the manner of the
wounds er ye take it in charge.

The first is. If any be wounded in the breast with a swoorde or other like
wepen / it is lightly to known if the wound wtin be cut through or not / for
the greatness of the wound. But is it with a dagger or arow it is ill to know if
it goth through or no^ Therefore it is needful to have to^es for to know the
same. And that token that the wound gothe through the breest / or in the
holnes of the breast is / as the wind comes out the wound / princypaly when
the nose and the mouth is stops / than shall you ha^ge a little feder on a
threde a fore ye wound / is the wound through than shall meue the feder. The
token that the heart is wounded / is the blacknes of ye blood / and that the
members without be cold / the superfluyte of the sweyt / of swommynge / or
Sincopis minuta. The place of such a wound is under the lift pappe / and
that is not good such a wound to take in hand therefore it is a cause for to
refuse it / for it is a deedly cure. The tokens that the longue is wounded that
ye blood coming there out is read and shomynge / and the pacyente is hoote and
kowckyth / and is pale an ye place of the wound is on the right / And as
Galienus said / when much bloo^yth through the mouth without pain / that is a
token that the veins be hurt / The token ye the diafragma is wou^dyd / that he
cannot hale his wind to him / and strongly cowghed with blood and slymy
spattyll / and that the pacyent has great pain in his fyde / and the place of
this wound is by the small rybbys / if ^herto comythyll accede^te / ^han it is
dedly / and if the blood rya in ye belly / than it will corrupt for need and
rotte / and the token of this is heaviness of the side / and of ye small rybbys /
stynkynge spatyll with much cowghe / and the pacyent has therewith the axcis
/ and Jamer said also / the wind that comyth out of ye wound / and the mouth
styncketh so sore yt it may not be suffryd / and yt clowte stynckyth of the
blood tha^t comyth from ye wound / and the wound that gothe through ye back
/ is in more peril than ye other / for the veins / synowes / throat / and
stryngis of the heart / and that is fastenyth to the back / and the wound of
the mary is also sore peryllous / and the wound of the back bone that is not
deep / that is not peryllous / and the wound that towched not the back bone /
is not so peryllons. If the wound be small without lesynge of the substance /
and that comes not to noneyll accedence / yt shall be dressed with tow depped in
the white of an egg / and therein mydle a letyll drogo^s blood with
franke^sence / lyme of egg shel les / and on the. iij. day shall the wound be
dressed again / and than hele it with a gre^ woundyd plaster / or with the Jewys
plaster / or with bawme / but will you occupye the bawme / so must you occupye
it at ye beginning to the ending without dressyng of the white of an egg
doing thereto / and also defend the wound from hete and swellynge with that
de^ensi^um.

A Defensyffe.
Take role armeno / oil of roses / and a letyll venegre. If the wound be
great yt it must be sowed / than sow it and bind it so as I have learned you
before / and ye shall hele it like another wound with the grene woundyd plaster
/ or with the Jewys plaster / or with the bawme. If the wound be so great and
deep stytcheth or shotten / that it gothe in the hole of the body / of such a
wound said Rogerius / Brunus / Wylhelmus de Saleceto / Lancfrancus / that it
shall not be bounden / for cause ye blood shol de not abide within / and such
a wound shall be kept up with tents / depeth with oil of roles / and with
salve / and stryke about with defenstuum / and when ye be sure of ye ill
accidence / than shall ye cleanse the wound with this.

A clensynge.
Take Franke^sence / Myrra / Farina lupinorum / of each an ounce / straynyd
rose honey vi. ounces. camomyll flowers. ij. ounces wine one pound / and a
half / all this together mydled / and this in the wound s^owttyd / for to
cleanse the wound / and take heed that ye spowtte no more in the wound than he
may suff^e / and than roll the pacyont on a table roundabout / and turn him
upon the wound / that the clensynge may comeout again / if he may that suffer
no more / so do in ye wound again ye te^tes / and cle^se it with this plaster.
Take rose honey / fra^kencense / myrra / sarcocolle / or take an other plaster.

A plaster.
Take strayned rose honey turpentyne vi. ounces. barley meell / as much as it
neded / and tha^ shall ye wound be clean with this plaster / and with this
plaster / and with the aforsayd spowtynge / that takyth away ye ill matter /
and this is the counsel of ye aforsayd masters / because if ye matter should
abide in ye wound / it would cometo ye heart / and to al other gentle me^brys
within ye body / and it would be the death of the pacyent. Theodoricus and
Henricus said that the wound should be closyd. and if it is of need yt the
pacyent is ^eble / tha^ shall yegyue him strengthyng and confortynge to the
nature / and if the wound be not hastily closen / ye natural het ^holde
through the wound come out / and the cold air would go in / which air
dystroyeth the wound / but Guido makyth concord between the aforsayd masters
/ and said that the substance of the things that comyth in the wound of the
breast / as well it is in the first part / as in the other part And to all the
wou^des of ye breast belongth ^woo curis / one win / and another without / and
this wou^des is to be known by ye for said ^oke^s. As you know by the
aforsayd tokens / that there is no membre within wounded / or that no matter
comyth therein / the wound shall ye hele without tents / and with plasters and
salve incarnati^u^ / and with plu macyoles deppeth in wine / and with byndynge
that seldo^ be changed / if ye be called to a wou^dyd person / and that ye
^ere ye wound has bleded inward / that shall ye know by ye ratlynge of the
pacye^t / and has he bleded a little / and that ye blood rynnynge is done /
than command you ye pacyent to stupe on ye wound / and that he may meue him
that the blood may come out / and as that is done / so let ye wound be tentyd
with medsynes or drynes that drawith outward / as turpentyne / or honey that is
better that drawyth outward / and dries / and clensyth. And bind him with
plumacyoles of tow / but not to styffe / in this same day let him blood / In
ye. iij. day glyster the wound with the soden wine / as I shall say here after /
than turn the pacyent on the wound / and there in do reasonable tentys / and
that it let not ye out coming of ye engeled blood or matter / and the tentys
shall be bound with a long threde / because that the tente ^all not in the
ho^nes of the breast / for the pacyent should suffer much harm. If there be the
rynnynge of the blood / than ye shall not stop it / but if it rynnyd to much
/ than it is nedeful to stop it / yt the pacyent leese not his might. As that
blood is stopped / and the other side is let blood on the vain / and the wound
is glystert with wine / than ha^^e you with the tents / and plastets that the
blood may melt / and consume / and ta^ge away the pain / as is these hera^.

A salve.
Take Farina ordei. xij. ounces. Farin^ ^enigreci. viij. ounces. Florum ^an.
oun^ Ab^inthei / Calamenti / and rubb^ d^^anne / of each. iiij. ounces / This
is the best experyment drawing out the blood of the ground of the body. As
any ^lede inwa^de through the wound / than take of the under crust of a lofe /
as hoote as it comith out of an oven / and lay the crom of the breed upon the
wound / as hoote as he may ^uffer it. And ye pacyent shall be laid upon ye
side on ye wound / this do as often as he may suffer it / till there in is no
more blood / and tha^ shall be give him medsyns to ^ele him

A medsyne.
Take bolus armenus / terra sigillata / with water therein is soden roses /
sumach / ballaustie / granorum myrtillorum / masticis / sytrinorum / or ye
shall give him medsyns consolidatyues / as terra sigillata / bolus arminus / of
each ii. ounces. Mumie iij. ounces. Sumach Sytrinoru^ / Sorboru^ / ^o^solida
ma^oris / et medie of each an handful / and sethe this in rain water / or in
water therein iron is quensyd in. Gothe the wound through to the inward
members / and they is woundyd / than may ye yuge the wound dedly /
nevertheless / does the best / for the nature is sometime stronger than ye wene.
Therefore shall ye take heed where ye wound goothe in / or touchyd / And is the
wound in the heart / than receyuyth the wound of ye heart no helynge / because
there is some veins by the heart / as they is wou^dyd / tha^ comyth the haestely
death / and that blood dystroyed ye natural hette / Or is ye wound in ye
lo^gues / it may not be well heelyd / but with great suttylte of an experient
surgyan / and the wound comyth comenly to corrupcyon and rottynge / for the
matter may not be clensyd / than with cowhynge / for the cowhynge makes the
wound wyder / also it is need that the wounded members be in rest / for the
longues is altymes meurnge / the longue has also a sharp suttyll blood / that
not alone dystroyeth the ill flesh / but corodyth and consumyth the good
flesh / (As Galienns said) The medsyns that should hele the longues that can
not come to the longues / than through the long way of the mawe and the liver
/ and there leesyth the helynge his might / therefore ye longues may not well be
helyd / therefore the pacyent gettyth Empeti^i / that is that he matter spatyd /
thereafter is he Ptisices and dyed.

As Diafragma is woundyd / he may not be well curyd / because it is altyme
meuynge / and it is in the seruyse of the heart / geuy^ng wind / therefore is
her workynge needly to the breeth / than is that also hurt / As ye parties
within be woundyd / there the senewes / muscles / and flesh tokyth her
beginning / of ye which wou^dige takyth ye heart lightly great harm If ye
wound goth to ye inward me^bres / and is ye aforsayde tokens in the longues
not great / and is the wound outwart small / than must ye make ye wound a
little greter / that ye may do therein the medsyns / drynes / and syccatyffes
made of this alterfolowynge powder.

A syccatyffe powder.
Take Dragantum / Mastike / Olybanu^ / Gu^mi arabici / Fenigreci / of each like
much. And his meet shall be of Bra^ne water midled with penidium. And comaunde
the pacyent to be still and to rest without meuynge. If the wound is in
Dyafragma and the accydentes little / than order him such meet and drink that
dryueth away ye cowhe. Also put in the wound a small tente depped in oil of
roses and meddled with ye yolk of eggs / like ye cure of other wounds If the
wound is inward there ye synewes has his beginning / than it is good to give
ye pacye^t to lyck or to suck cleuyng medsyns as Dyaspermata / that is most
vsyd to co^fortynge of ye breast / or Dyacodion / or Dyasymphicon / And that
yeshall lay about on ye wound / it shall be Embrationes with wine / or with
dryenge plasters and with oil. in the somer with oil of roses. And in the
wyntter with oleum Nardinu^ and plasters made of Calcantum / as it sto^de in
primo cathagenorum named ^^yapalma. If the longues / or if the inward members
is not helyd in. iiij. days. so^ it not well to be helped. Nevertheless help
him with a good rule / and let the pacyente lay on the wound / and bind the
wound (...) the blood and the matter altymes may come out. And if the pacye^t
may not suffer to lay all times on the wound / than may ye torn him on the
other side / but most part on the wound.

Item the comune medsyns or drynes to all innermoost members / shall be taken
the medsyns they most makyth softnes and swetnes. and that takyth away that is
most contrary to the wound / as herafter standyd. Take Erugo eris /
Pomphiligos / Lytargirum / Cerusa. Al is that these aforesaid medsyn makyth
fast and hole the members without. Nevertheless they opened the innermoost
members.



Therefore ye masters of this conning should take and give the pacye^t some
medsyns co^uenyently to the cicatrices inwardly / and these medsyns must he
swellowe through the throwte with out chowyug and there to ye must take things
yt is sower and slymy / as Ypoquistidos Ealaustie / Galle / Psydie / Terra
sygillata / Sumach / Rose / and these must be colyd with other stoppynge colyges
/ as Maloru^ citonioru^ / or ^ube extremitatu^ / or Myrti / or with sharp ^oyne
there with mydled Diadragantu^. ^yll ye have a good cle^syng / tha^ dohyma wassyng
sode^ with honey of ye best / for in all such medsyns is honey. If ye know by the
tokens aforsayd that in ye throughgoyng wound the matter is fallen downward with
in. tha^ tarry not long to pull out ye matter. and Wylhelm. cou^sayled it / and
said also that the wound shall be made greter / that the matter and the blood
may well come out of ye wound tentynge with a tente deppeth in oil of roses /
and the tente shall be broad without the wound / because it should not fall in
/ and it shall be bound with a thread / that if it were fall in / that it may
be pull out again. And Rogerius commands therefore yt the pacyent shall be
tournyd on his bake / that the matter of the wound may come out. Jamerus
co^maundyd that a glystere shall be put i^ ye breast with a reasonable quantite
of wine / And turn the cye^t with his ba^on a table rounda^ out / and than
let ye wine com out again. And if it come again as clear as it was spowteth
therein and comes there out not so much as there was spowteth in / than let of
your (...) owtynge and hele the wound. But Albucasis co^maundith that you shall
hold op^ the wound layng therein old tow / that the matter and other sup^ue
moystnes gothe out. and command that the pacyent may belayd on the wound /
for the matter which there is gadereth may run out. And Albucasis says / as
there is past. iij. or. iiij. days the time of the wound / and that the
pacyente has no shaking of the heart / nor crampe nor streyghtnes in the
breast / and that his condycyon and disposycyon of him is good Than shall ye
know that the wound is in a good case / and yt the nature is strong / than
less your tents / and the cure. Yt ye mark that the pacyent may not suffer
such medesynes or drynes / than less your tente and lay on the wound one
mundificatiuu^ plaster made in this manner.

A plaster.
Take strayned Rose honey. xxiii^. ounces. Myrre / Franke^sence / Sarcocolle /
of each an ounce / faryna Fenigreci / farina Ordei / of each a like much that
it be Inowghe to make as thycke as honey. and do thereto aly teil turpentyn that
is very good. After ye cou^seyile of Guydo give him to drink De^ torye /
Castorie / Nepida / Eariophyiata / Pipineile / Piloselle / the tops of Nemp
Reedcowles / Atha^sis or Tanacetu^ / Lycorys / of each. v. dragma. and sethe
this with honey and wine / and give him hereof to drink a goblet full at every
morning. And can ye not perceive the thorough going of the wound with te^tes
depped in oil of roses / nor with no other things / nor the pacyent may not
suffer we sihynge nor out pullyng of the matter / and the pacye^t has heaviness
and vpblowynge in the side / and other tokens / that is a knowledge that ye
matter is gadered up Dyafragma. Is than the pacyent strong and well content /
than cou^say led Wilhelmus / that ye make a new wou^ de with a zesour in the
neder part of the sy de of the pacye^t against the back bone between the.
iii. and. v. rybbe. or between ye iii. and. iiii. rybbes. for the Dyafragma is
bowen with the rybbes and with the back bone to the. iii. and. iiii. rybbe. and
the bowynge might leave the out coming of the matter / than would the Snrgean
thyncke he hadnot cut deep Enough / therefore it is the better to cut between
the. iiii. and. v. rybbes. And as ye cuttynge is done / than^e lay therein a
tente depped in warm oil of roses unto the ground till the matter com me.
and in the time of ye dressynge / dress ye wound shortly / that the air
enter not in to the inwardly members / for that the out blowynge do not harm /
And as the matter begin to apyre / than shall you cleanse the innermoost place
thorough the new wou^n de with this washing hereafter.

A clensynge.
Take wine wherein sodden is Camomylle Faryna lupinorum / Rose honey: al to gyder
mydlyd / taking so much as it is Inowgh and than strain it: and thereof spowte
one pond in the wound. Than shall you the pacient roll rou^dabout and than
turn him again on the wound / that the wine and the clensynge may come out
again / and than put the^ a tente depped in rose honey: Than lay thereupon that
mundificatiuum or the grene wounded plaster therein is much rosyll. and let the
old wound be closyd shortly. Auicenna says. As ye thyncke be to much matter
in Pleuresy that not is clensyd in. xl. days. or les / that does the parsone
fall in ptisym and to outdryeng of the naturally moystnes. Therefore it nedyd
to such a wound to occupy a cauterye with a hoote Iron / wherewith ye may
through bore the breast to the place there the matter abyded in / that the
matter may be dried and that the matter may be driven out by little and by
little / and wasshe it with honey water yt the matter may come out to the
vtermoost membre / and as the wound is pure clensyd / than go to the helynge
If thereto comyth an impostume / than shall yon cut open a rybbe on another
place of the side / as I have learned you / and it shall be on the same side there
the matter is / and than let the mattter out / that should be not of need were
the wound before defendyd from the swellynge / as I have learned you. Take also
head as ye let the matter goo out that ye make the pacyent not febler /
therewith he should lose much of his might. And if the spryte of life is lesyd
/ than follows often times the death. Therefore take good head to him yt ye him
the tente intymes put in / depped in oil of roses midled with rose honey for
better cle^syng of ye wounded place. And also cleanse the wound about with
vngue^tum apostolicum / which salve clensyd all wounds. Thereafter wasshe the
wound with this after following myxture.

Take wine therein es sodde^ Myrre / and ye shelles or ga^nat apples / and
wasshe there with every day the wound. And hele it with the grene wounded
plaster: and with this powder herafter following.

Take Masticke: Myrra: Frankensence: Sarcocolle: Dragons blood: of each like
much: made and driven in powder / and than with ye wine wasshe the wound and
straw therein that powder / and lay there over the plaster / and plumacioles.
and bind it with a baunde deppeth in the wine: and hele it. Some manner of the
byndynge of the wounds in the breast makyth ye flesh: and sam holdyth alone
the medsyns. The first byndynge which makyth flesh must be broad and long:
and therewith begin the byndynge on the contrary side: and bind the. ii.
^^^es crossewyse on the wound: and wind about with the band so often as it
nedyth: and sow the ends of the band on that first part far from the same
wound And Henricus said Thereto shall be knotte two small cords / the one
going on the shulder: and the other under the arm.

Rogerius for the medsyns to hold makes a broad ba^de with holys and with one
end and that other end cut: that ye shulder may go through the hole of the
end of the band and wind the breast rou^dabout / and com again there you began.
and with that cutteth end bi^de him the shulder. If it may be done without
cuttynge / and omwyndynge the breast / tha^ shall ye byndyng be to lyghter / as
he says / For to come no impostume vnd the arm so is the breast bound with a
cuttynge band / and with the one end es bound roudabout ye breast coming
under the other hole of ye arm / and with the other end bind about over ye
shulder / and comy again on ye first side / and is theraft bound vnd ye other
hole of ye arm.

Of the wound in the mawe molste / or pyt of the heart. Ca. xlix.
THe wound throughgoynge ye mawe. is very peryst. As the mawe wounded that
shall ye know by ye outcomynge of ye meet. and is ye place of ye wound before
/ than it is dedely. Is the wound of the mawe not great / and it is in a
flesshly place / than may it be helyd with one good sur gean. Is there any wound
by the mawe or in ye pytte of the heart through the skyn^e and flesh / tha^
shall ye hele it after ye. xii. chap. Is ye wound great and wide / or stryke^
with a sword / than shall ye the wound sow / bind / and hele after the. xiii.
chaptre.

Is the wound in the holl of the body with out hurtynge of ye mawe / or onyother
me^bee / than shall the wound be tent yd with oil of roses / and rose honey /
and ye yolke of eggs / till it begin togyue matter / and than cleanse it with
the plaster in ye chaptre of the breast / thereafter shall you do grown flesh
with vnguentum fuscum / or vngue^ tum aureum scdm Mosue / which salve I shall
set in Anthydorario / Orye shall c^c^se the wound with this after following
water.

A ciensynge water.
Take wine therein is sodde^ mirre / and shel lyso of garnat apples / and there
in straw it with the powder that stand in the asoresayde chaptre / and thereon
lay a grene wounded plaster / so long till it be hole. Is the wound in the
mawe in his substance / and it gothe through than is the wound deedly. Is the
wound not great like as of a dag ge^ or another sharp thing / than shall it
be made a little greter / tha^ sow it again which a thresquarnydyll / and with
awaxyd sylken thread / pryncypally as ye wound is in the fles^hy part. If the
wound be in the vppermoost part there ^ynewes be / than is the sowynge for
naught / and upon the sowynge shall you lay this powder.

A powder.
Make it of white ^anckensence / mastic(...) (...). agantum / Gommi ara^ci / of
each a dragma / dragons blood / Mumie / of each half a dragma. and after shall
ye sow the wound without / and leave the thread hanging without the wound
there the maw is sowyd / as when that ye lose within the seem so may you it
pull out again / and on the seem without ye may say this powder here after
following.

A powder.
Take dragons blood (...) franckensence / lyme of egg shellys / and drive it
in powder. than hele these wounds without and within like other wounds. and
also with wound drink / as I shall learn in Anthitodario. For all yt
Lans^a^cus says that ye wound without shall not be cured. The wound within
shall first be cured / but that is not good / but the wound yt is with out may
be changyd through the cold of the air / and that should be the lettyng of
helynge of the wound within. And as the wound within is not helyd shortly /
tha^ will it never hele. Therefore must you apply hastily to the helynge of
this wound.

And is the wound with shot / than pull out the arowe as I have learn you /
and fyl the wound withoyle orroses / mydled with the yolke of eggs. Defend.
the wound with defenlyffe / The other day shall ye lay on one plaster
mundificatiuu^ / as long till the wound be well clensyd. And after shall ye
was^he the wound w wine in like wise as is in the aforesaid chaptre.

If the wound ve cut with a sword / and is great / than sow it / and on the
some lay this powder / of dragons blood / lyme of egg shelles / white
franekensence.

A powder.
Item. ^ilhe^m^ made this powder of dragons blood / dragantum / gomme of araby
of each like much / for this helyd ye wound to gyderr. Thervpo^ lay towe
deppydin ye white of an egg mydled with a little of ye aforesaid powder. And
after cleanse ye wound with oil ofroses / and with rose honny. and wasshe it
with sodde^ wine / like as it stand in the Chaptre of the wound in the breast.
And yfther to come any ipostSpan^acio^ than straw therein this aforesaid powder
and lay thereon ye grene wounded plaster till the wound be well hole. Hold all
times ye rule of meet an drink / and lettynge blood / and doing well his
easement / as is aforesaid in the chap. of ye wou^des in ye Joynte.

Of the wound in the belly. Ca. l.
Some time is the wound in the belly before / and some time be hynde / And the
wound ye es besore and through the web or fleme there the boweles lay in.
that one is called Myrach and that other is a thynne panycle / and is called
Syfac / and lies within Myrach / and kepyth in him the guttys / and on the
hinder part is the. v. spondeles of the run / and the flesh there under.
Also is there wounds within / as in the many fold / in the guts / and in the
mawe / and in the run / and in the mother (or matrix) and in the bladder / The
wounds in the belly is sometime that gothe not out / and sometime gothe there
out that fleme callydzirbus / and the guts / or other like. And the wounds
happenyth sometime with a sword / and sometime with a lance / and sometime with an
arow / and sometime with other instrume^tys / that slyt chyd o^ttyth. Some
woundys be great and some small cut with a dagger / some twhart / and some cleuyd
in length. Some little / some great / some wide / and some narowe. And this
poynttys must ye know^r ye begin to cure the wound. And herafter following
be the tokens of the wound / whereby ye shall know what membrys there be wonnded
without or within the body. The token of ye wound in ye belly going not through
it is known by the sight / and by ye pronfe / as that there comyth not out. The
token of the wound of a strtche ye is going within / that is be known as yt
proof gooth deppe in ward / and as zirbus / or ye guts / or any other
goth^t. The token that zirbus has been long out / as it is chau^gyd / that is
as his substance is black and stynkynge. That token that the guts is
woundyd / that is as the dyrte gothe out / And if the great guts / or small
guts be woundyd / is known through the place of ye wound. above the navel
is the small guts / and under the navel is ye great guts. The token that
ye mawe is wou^dyd I have said in ye fore wrytyn chaptre. The token (...) the
liver is woundyd / is to know in ye (...) coming of the blood / and the
wound is in the right side The token yt the mylt is woundyd / that is the out
coming of stynkynge / and is in the left side. The token that the renes be
woundyd / is known by out coming of watery blood. Galienus said that the
wound and sowynge is more peryllous in the myddys of the belly / than in the
sides. The wound that gothe not through shall be helyd / with the grene wou^dyd
plaster or bawme / like an other wound / as is learned in the. xii. and. xiii.
chaptre. In like wise shall be cured ye through going wound within / as there no
lymmys be wou^dyd / than alone yt the wound gothe through Myrach / and Sysa^ /
this wound is cured in the same manner afor said / and it must have another
sowynge. The sowynge of the belly^ is in m^my manners / And Galienus commanded
the sowynge all thus. In the first threst the nedyll in the one lyppe of the
wound / and to wche with ye nedyl Syfac / and af^e^ that trest the nedyll
through Myrach and knet it on the wound. And in the second stytche / let ye
nedyll godin through the one lyppe / through that hole Myrach and Syfac / and
that shall be knet without / and goo so forth till yt be all sown / and Galienus
said another sowynge / and Albucasis folo^ with the sowynge / and it is more
commonly and lyghter. The sowynge is in this manner / ye shall sow the border of
ye lyppys together and to every stytche a knotte / as much as it nedyd.
Albucasis set the manner with the nedyl and sowynge / as is aforsayd / but
let the nedyll stytche in it / and wind the thryd about the nedyll / as is
aforsayd in ye xiij. chaptre. Lanfrancus and Henricus said another manner / that
ye shall ^iytche with a nedyll the thryde without in the lypre or ye wound /
and stytche it through Myrach / and Syfac / and so as ye stytche may be ordered
right / thereafter sow the other part of the lyppe outward again / and cut of
the endys of the threde / and let it belong Inowgh / and after that sow in
such manner / and let between ye stytchis a space of atwhart finger / and as
that is done / make one knot of the. iiij. stytchys / and so goo for the in the
sowynge of the hoole wound / and through the sowynge of Syfac / that has no
flesihe / be cured with the help of Myrach / and with the wound outwardly / and
the bands of ye breast may we occupye to this woundys of the belly / there no
lymmys be wou^dyd / nor comyth out: When the guts is wou^dyd over twhart / or
is in pecis / tha^ it is dedly / if it be length woundyd / it may be helped.
If that the wound / of ye belly is not great Inowgh / than shall ye make it
greater / as I shall show you herafter / than shall you take out properly the
guts / and sow it there after as it is nedeful / with a skynners nedyll /
Jamericus / Theodoricus / Rogerius lay elder pypes in the guts / under the
seem / yt ye seem rotte not. Wilhelmus and some other / lay therein a part of a
crier of a throat goll of a be / as the. iiij. masters says / But
Lanfrancus and Guide they think it not be prof* table / for that nature is
inclyned to outdrawynge strange thyngys / and thus yt help not therefore it
was laid / and it is better that the guts be sowyd / as a fore is said / and
that it be clensyd of the uncleanness / and that powder shall hastily be laid on
ye seem / and is made in this manner*

A powder.
Take Mastick / Dragantum / Gommi arabice / of each anounce. Dragons blood /
Mumie / of each halfanounce. than shall ye the guts put inagayne / as I shall
learn you / and after that shall ye sow ye utter skin / and also that fleme /
there ye guts lies in / and in the uttermost seem / lay that powder in
delendynge of the same. And master Milhelmus de saliceto saw a knyghthur
tinge him self with a knyfe iu his belly yt the gutttys run out / and the
guttys was wounded in the length. And to the same was fette Ottobanus of Papia
/ the which gave him ill conforte saying yt he must dye / for cause he would
put in again the guttys / and they ware so grreatly swollen that they might
not come magayn. Than came the friends of the pacyent prayng him to come to the
wounded parsone. And as Wylhelmus saw the pacyent / than he co^^ maunded to
brenge warm wine / for the time was to short for to seed water with Camomylle
/ and Anyse. And with the wy ne he wasshyd the guttys there ye dyrte came out /
than sowed he ye guttys to gyder again / and he laid on the seem the
aforesaid powder. And tha^ he would put in again ye guttys / and they was so
sore swolle^ yt they cowde natbe ha^delyd / for the wound was to narowe / than
he cut the wound greter with a sharys / and put the gutttys therein again /
and he sowed the fleme / and also ye skin. and than he helyd the knight that
he lyfde many years after / and has chylderne by his wife. Comyth the Liver
out of ye wound / and is deppe woundyd in his substance than lysed she his
workynge / therefore it is dedly / for the wounds may not be helyd for the
superfluyte of the blood / why the is the fou^dament and matter of the life But
is she not wounded in any part that belongyth to her / than put in again the
liver and the wound shall be curyd like another wound. Is the liver alytell
wounded and not sore / tha^ shall it behelyd of a good Surgean like another
wound. And it must becured hastly er it chau^gyd / while it is fresshe. If the
Mylte be wounded / ye must well search in what perte of here substance she is
wounded / And is there apyce cut of / than fulfill the other place of ye hole
mylt. but not as ye port be cut over ^whart / and as ye wound of ye mylte is
hard and thereof comes the water spring (or ydropisys) / and ever feebleness of
ye mawe. And hangs the mylte out / than put it in again / And as zyrbus gothe
out that is ye fleme / and is that corrupted / tha^ bind or knotte that there
is corrupt / as Galyenus says / an cut it of after the knottynge unto the
neder part of the belly / and ye shall leave out of the belly the end of ye
knottynge that the threde of the sowyng of the guttys may be pluck out again
as the wound is clensyd. As ye seem is made in zyrbus / tha^ put in to the
belly that same zyrbus again and sow the wound in the belly shortly. and let
it not open till the inner wound be hole also Jamerius Rogerius Lanfra^cus
commaundyd. and the cause is this. There is no thing that does so much hurt
the inner ^imes or members as does the towchynge of the vttermoost air / of
the which air it chaungyth / and gettyth ill accydentes of pain / and hardness
of the guts / thereafter they may get the crampe / and after to dye In the
wounds in the guttys prasyth some masters the glyster of strong black
colored warm wine / and prycypally as ye guts has many hooles. And all his
meets to the. viii. days shall be thynne. for it comyth not to rottyng / but to
helynge to gyder. And herto the. iiij. masters praysyd afterfolowinge. Lay
wheet bra^ne an how re and than take it out again / and do there to this drynes.

A Powder.
Take flower of sterche / Dragantum (...) miarabici / Dragons blood:
Consolidama ior or Ambra: the here of an hare / and give him twyse or thryse at
every day. Is the pacyent feeble than give him the soppys of sap therein is
sodde^ chyke^s / and if there be said in Dragantum. and Gommi arabici: it were
very good / and water therein is sodden Fra^kencense: Masticke / and this pray
seth Wilhelmus and Rogerius. If there be any parsone stytcheth or woundyd thar
his guts come out / and they be not hastly puti^ again that they be unclean
/ swellyng and chaungynge by the air / than shall ye take warm water therein
is sodden Camomylle flowers / Ameis. or take warm wine which has no befulle
ryppe / as Lanfrancus said / therein shall ye wet a sponge and than warm the
guttys therewith / and salve ye gut les with rose oil / and put the guttys again
in to the belly. Theodoric^ cuttyth open a pyg / or another be in ye mids
in tweyn and laid it as warm on the guttys so often yt the guts may lessyd
of the swellyng / that it may come in again. If ye guts be fallen on ye
ground yt it be foul / tha^ lay it in warm gootys milk / and cleanse it therein
/ and than put it again in to ye belly. Be the guttys swollen and the wound
be small yt the guttys will not in again / than commanded Galie. Milhelm^ /
Lanfra^c^ / and more other / yt the wound in the belly shall be cut so great
that the guttys may be put in again.

To this cuttynge is co^uenyent yt instrument called Samgatoria crokydlyke a
syckyl / before on the crokynge sharp / but not sharp on the point / and
Albucasys set it in a pycture as here standed.



The pacyent shall lay on his back and hye against the wound / and the surgean
shall wisely cut ye wound yt the other guts com not out / and than put in
again the guttys yt is out. And ye Surgean must have a good seruan^t which
shall taken head of the guttys without with his hand softly / and than take ye
wound in the mids and cut the wound wyder / and put therein again the
guttys / than sow it as is aforsayd. Thereafter defend ye seem and the wound
(as Galyenes said) with Formacis that is called sanguinolentis / yt in other
members ye wound makyd fast / like as does the powder yt holds the seem /
and the plumacioles with wine / and the plaster with other drynes that makyth
flesh. Co myth there pain of the cuttyng or sowyng as it happens often
times (as Auice^. said in his. iij. Canon of the cure ofydropisis) yt of ye
cuttynge comes pain and pryckyng Therefore it is good to put therein oil of
dyll or camomyl / and upon the place of the cuttyng lay ye plaster made of
lynseed / hye malowe seed / femgreke / of each like much. And some other
masters as Henricus for takyn ge away the pain and swellynge / they sethe
wine with salt therein / and so much branne that it be thycke / and they puts
in a bag and laid thereupon as hot as the pacyence may suffer. Somtymes is
done thereto the aforsayd oil / and do it so often till the pain be gone. The
matter that is let in the belly and can not come through the seem ye need it
not to fere greatly / for the moysines can not be much / and they members has
not much blood as Wilhelmus says / the nature resoluyth and co^sumyth the
moystnes and sendyth to the flanckys / and there it be enryd like another
ipostume in ye same place.

Of the wound in the bladder / and in the kydney. Ca. li.
WEre a wound in ye parts which holde^ / as ye skyn^ and flesihe / it shall be
helydly ke a wound in ye xii. and. xiii. chaptre. But ye wound in theumer
lymmes yt be holden / as in the kydneys and bladder / and ye mother or matrix of
a woman. This be me^bres needful to every body / and this has no other cure
than the wound in the belly. That token yt the bladder is wounded yt is the
outcomynge of the vryne through ye place in pectine. That token yt the mother or
matrix is woundyd / it shall be known through the place under ye nauyll
through the outcomynge of the blood / and cure the wound like another wound
with sowynge princypally when the wound is by ye neck of the matrix for there
is ye more flesh / there for the wound is the better to make fast.

The wound in the kydney may not be he lyd / for it is feded with the watery
blood that the helynge belettyd / and also it is altyme^ in meuynge / and it is
ye way where through the vryne comyth. The wound in ye bladder can not be helyd
/ for it is a synewy part without flesh / and is altyme meuynge / and to
receive the vryne and to give out again / But the wound yt there is in the
neck of the bladder there it has flesh and blood / that may be helyd with a
truwe cure / like as it be seen as the stone there be cut out. which stone is
grown from long times in the body of a man.

When the wound is in the hole of ye bladder there as no flesh nor blood is
that the vryne comethout / that is deedly. For all ye sow the bladder / and
lay upon the seem this plaster solowynge.

A Salve.
Take Rose honey. xxiiij. ounces. Frakence^se / Mastyck / Dragantum / of each.
ii. ounces* made in powder / and meddled with the rose honey. and lay about the
wound that defensyffe / and hele it. And ye pacye^t shall take heed for much
drinking till he be hole. As ye be called to such pacientes that is wou^dyd
in such a place / than say to their friends that such a wound is deedly. and
promise the pacyent always his health.

And first command the pacyent to be confessed as one that shall dye / ereuer
his power fail / and his wit change. and there after shall you work for his
health / for the nature does often fail that the surgean thinks impossible
to help it / pryncypally as nature gets help with a good work.
Nevertheless ye shall not believe no good token that often happens to the
pacyente. For Ipocras sath / that ye shall not tryst in the pacyente that
mendeth hastly without cause / also ye shall notfere an evil token without
cause / for this dysceyueth often. And ye shall think always that the pacient
shall dye / or else he is all heled.

This cure ye may take in hand in your land / or in your country there as
ye are known. But in strange lands take ye none such in hand / or other
wou^des that is in peril.

Of woundesi^ the iarde or coddes Ca. lij.
THe wounds in this place is ferefull for her subtle composicyon / and
conyngly workynge / nevertheless if ye yard of the man be wounded in length or
euerth warte / and if the wound be not great it shall be cured with ye sowynge
/ powder / lettynge blood an ye vain / and with good paysyon as another
wound. And if the wound be overthwart and clean cut of / than is ye wound
most in peril / by the reasen of many synewes and veins / therefore sometime
ye pacyent dies or ye blood be stopped

For easynge of the pain in such a wound. Take warm oil of roses and
anoynte therewith from the vpperparte of the yard under the nauyll / and about
Periconiam that is between the foundament and his preuyte / and brenne the
wound roundabout with a brennynge iron / with that ye blood may be stopped /
and to take away the cra^pe which comyth often of the pain. And thervpo^ you
may lay also ye stone aforesaid iu ye. xv. chaptre. and also the stone made in
powder and there among meddle Dragons blood / white Frankencense / and
Aloepaticum / of each like much mydled with the white of eggs stryken on a
clothe / or plumacyole yt in ye mids has a hole as great as a strawbery /
and the plumaciole laid thereon that the hole may come euenly to the pype of
the yard that the vryne may com through / and over it shall you do your
byndynge / and behind roundabout ye shall lay the defensyuum And ye shall
give the pacyent every morning / noone / and euenyng the medycynable wound
drink that I shall set in Antidothario. The wounds in the coddes destroyed ye
coddes / and takes lightly away the generatyon all is ye parson not in no
peril of death. And the cure of this is like the cure of a common wound.

Of the wound between the hyppes / and the nether part of the back. Ca. liij
IN this wound is no great peril / but if it be very great / yt the skyn
flesh / and the synewes be hurt / yt the same synewes be schronke^ so shall ye
man halte. If ye wound be cut with a knyfe sword or oterlyke wepe^. If the
wound be small / it shall be bound after ye. xij. chap. If the wound be great
yt it must be sowe^ / than sow and bind it after the. xij. chaptre. and shall
be heled as another wound with ye grene wounded plaster / or bawm / as it is
aforsayd. If ye wound be stryke^ with a dagger / ye shall tente it with a comely
te^te depte in oil of roses warm / and with ye yolke of eggs and so put it
therein as far as ye may with the foresaydoyle / unto the time the wound
begin to give matter / then cleanse it and he le it as another wound. Je may
ask me wherefore I have learned to put so much rose oil in the wound / and
that I have forbidden the rose oil in the. xij. and. xiij. chapt. Thervpo^
answer I / that ye should be the surer and faster in your workyng / and that
there to the lesser com the ill accydentes of ye hot impostumacyo^. It is more
profitable such evil accyde^t to defend / tha^ ye ill accyde^t to draw away
/ for the nature of ye oil by ye warmnes getynge of the fire / is swettynge /
softenynge / and opening / pryncypally in the narow and shoten wou^des / for a
stycke or a wound come to matter than comes seldom there to evil accydent.
Therefore I command you to do thereto a little of the yolke of an egg / for
the wound to get a little cle^ sing / yt the matter sooner should come. And al
times is very good to make such an oil of roses of unripe grene oil olyue /
for the ^ose oil and such oil olyue have in them alytel bytynge with styptica.
Also ye ripe oil olyue is good to make ripe ye ill accide^t / ye myddell ripe
oil does avoid ye matter / ye unripe grene oil is good for ye co^solidatiuu^
and for helynge together the wound.

If ye wound be made by ye shot of an arowe in this part of the body / than
draw it out and take as I have said in ye. xvij. chapter. Or supple the
wound withoyle of roses and there with shall it be tentyd for to come out / and
lay about the place a defensiuum than shall it be cleansed with this salve.

And after yt hele it with a grene wounded plaster / and the salve shall be
made of rose honey. xij. ounces / fenigreke meele / lyusede meele of each. iiij.
ounces / oil of camomell and barley meele of each. ij. ounces / lay this
thereon / for it takes away the pain / and cle^seth the place / his drink
shall be made with barley water sodden with parseley rotes / and let him take heed of blood lettynge / and to ye drawght going for it is needful to these
wounds / and command them to be quiet for there is no better thing for a
wounded parsone / and often comes of a little wound great harm because yt he
takes no head of such a wound / therefore take heed in such a cause.

Of the wound in the thyghe. Ca. liiij.
THe wounds in the thyghe or in ye thyckenes of the leg above the knee it is
dredful for the muscles that be there / and they be often deedly. Guido says /
there is but little dyffere^ce between these wounds and ye wounds in ye arms
but a lonely the wound of the thyghe is often deedly / and yt comes of evil
accedent / and if the wound be small / she shall be bound after ye. xij.
chapter / If ye wound be great yt it must be sowed / it shall be sowed after
ye. xiij. chapter / upon ye seem shall be laid the powder of dragons blood /
white frankencence / ye lyme of egg shelles / and leave one end of ye wound
open yt there thrugh^ the woundemay be cleansed. The first day lay in ye wound
ye yolke of an egg / with rose oil / for to cleanse it / and always do about
the wound defensiuu^ till it be well cleansed / than cause ye flesh to grow /
and hele it with ye grene wounded plaster / and at the beginning also ye may
hele it with halsom. If the wound be so deep that ye muscle be wounded / so we
the muscle with a waxentrede / and after the skyn And if the wound bleed to
much yeshal stop it as I have learned you in the. xv. chapter / and lay on
ye seem this powder / white franken feuce / ye lyme of egg shelles / and
dragons blood / and lay about the wound that defe^siuum / and in the wound
the yolke of an egg meddled with oil of roses / and yfye be sure there comes no
impostumacion / than lay thereon first mundificatinum / or the grene wounded
plaster / if the wound be deep and narowe / and bledeth sore / stop the
blood as I have learned you / and let blood out (...) vain there against / and
lay oner it tha^ fensiu^m. Je shall know also yt ye shall never take tents
for holding ye wounds open there as the wound is full of waynes or ^scly
flesh / for in such a wound comes great harm of the tents / therefore is
put in the wound oil of roses before the tents / for surenes that there
shall no evil accede^t come there to / therefore shall ye wound be cle^sed and
heled as is aforesaid / And if ye wound have not bleed much / the^ shall the
pacyent be let blood on the vain / and rule him with etynge and drinking and
to the drawght going / as you may se in ye chaptre of the rulynge.

Of the wound in the knee. Ca. lv.
SOre dreadful and deedly is ye wound in the kne / for ye great synewes that
is therein / for the knees has the most great bands Corda^ / and Neruorum /
and they be in the ^^thermore part / there the moystnes hastily comes
downewarde / therefore all these wou^des ben dangerous / for Au^c^nna says
that the wound on the knee by the shynne is evil / because that to the wound
comyth evil accydent / thereof s^e shall seldon be sure* and these wounds have
little dyfference of the wounds of ye arms / hands / and of feet / but
alonely this wound in this place is dreadful / pryncypally if the be. iij.
fyngers from the knee / for the goodness of ye place / so come there any accedent
that the good surgean can not better it / As it is often seen / that the
pacyent dies of a little wound / and also he must ernestly take heed of the
hinder part for ye ij. synewes that comes from the heed thrughe the back and
behind thrughe the legs to the sooles of the feet. I have seen many evil
accedentes coming of such small wounds there is little set by or taken, head
to / and ye mys^e fortune is fallen to me and other ^o / therefore it is
needful to take (...) for this wound / and to follow after ye xlv. chapter /
yt speaks of all such wounds of ye joints the plain matter / and
pryncypally of that glytynge water / and take good head to the learning of ye
same chapter / and forgette nothing to do after ye rewle of ye same chapter
/ and pryncypally yt the pacyent keep him still / that the wounded lyth and
member be in rest as little as the wound is / and of the wound be small ye
more charge is in it / therefore folowethe same learning till ye wound come to
his dysgestyon and gyuynge out of the matter / till ye be sure of all accedente
/ nevertheless tryst it not / but go forth and follow the good cure / till that
ye full wound be hole. If the wound be shot with an arowe supple out ye arowe
with warm oil as is before said / and the same oil shall do as much good in
the ^ounde as if ye tents were put in / an y^ shall strength ye said wou^nde
with defensinu^ / and ye shall let the pacyent blood out of ye vain / and to
do his easement / and as ye be sure yt there come no ^stume thereto / so shall
you cleanse the wound with vnguentu^ apostolorum secund^m Auice^nam thereafter
shall you cure it with a grene wound plaster / also take heed if there be any
bones depa^rted from other tha^ depart it hole / tha^ sow the upper part of
ye wound together / and leave the nether part open that the wound may be
cle^se thrughe every day / ye first day lay in the wound the yolke of anegge
meddled with oil of roses / ye next day ye shall cleanse the wound / after
that cause ye flesh to grow / and hele it like another wound.

Of the wound in the shynne, Ca. lvi.
IN ye shynnes is many synewes yt comes down from the brain therefore in the
wound of ye shynne is great peril / not alonely for the synewes but for ye
muscles that is iij. fyngers byneth ye kne through which many persons has
great ha^^e by.

If there come but little blood out of the wound / let him blood on the vayue
on the contrary part. and let him hold the rule in going to stole / as I
have says in the. xlv. chaptre. and he shall drink mydled wine.

If the wound bleed sore / floppe it as is said in the. xv. chaptre. and then
cleanse ye wound / and if it be need sow it and lay on ye seem the powder
aforesaid / and hele it as another wound / whereof many times es aforsayd.

Of wounds in the ancle. Ca. lvij.
IN the ancle is the wound peryllous / for it is set to gyder with small bones
/ Therefore as the ancle is wounded / it may not be set to gyder in his right
co^posycyon as he was before. And also the ancle is fastenned with many synewes
/ and as they be wounded it is hard to help. If it be wounded with an arowe /
ye shall anoynte the place with oil of roses / and draw out ye arowe and put
in the wound the aforsayd oil. And as ye be sure of the wound / then ye shall
cleanse it / and after ye shall hele it with a grene wounded plaster. and the
pacyent shall hold the rule of lettynge blood / and of the stole going / as
I have said before: If ye pacyent be very syke or feeble / give him of a sodden
chycken / and give them also meddled wine. And if ye wound be gretely cut unto
the bone / cleanse it withinwarde / and then so we the wou^deto gyder again. And
if the synewes be cut / sow them to gyder and afterward the skin / and lay
on the seem this powder of Dragons blood / Dragantum / Go^miarabici / of each
like much and in the mouth of the wound put oil of roses mydled with rose
honey. This do. iij. or. iiij. days. and lay about the wound a defensyuu^.
And afterward cleanse the wound / and hele it with a grene wounded plaster
like another wound.

Of the wou^des of the feet / or among the toes. Ca. lviij.
THe wound in this place must ye know if it be shot with an arowe / stycked /
or cutteth / if it be ouertwhart or a length / and if the arowe go through or
not. And if ye arow be in ye foot draw it out as I have learned you in the.
xvi. chapter / if you fere there sold come pain thereto by the reason that
there be many veins in the foot / fill ye wound with warm oyl^ roses / and so
you may draw it out softely and lay in the mowth of ye wound oil of roses
meddled with rose honey / and about the wound this defensiuum / of oil of roses
/ boly armeny / with a little vynegre / and as you be sure of anguysshe cleanse
the wound and hele it with the grene wounded plaster or with Jeuys plaster /
If the cut wound bleed sore / than stop ye bledynge as I have learned you in
the chapter of the wounds stoppynge / than sow it and bind it as I have
said in ye. xiij. chapter / and lay upon ye wound ye powder of whyt
frankensence dragons blood / the lyme of egg shelles / and about the wound
lay the defensyu^ aforesaid / then cleanse ye wound / and hele it like another
wound. Also lay the foot hye and keep it metely warm so yt the moystnes come
nottherin. And keep the pacyent in rule of meet and dryuke / and of going to
ye draught as I have learned you. Also you shall know yt the synewes comes from
the brain. and yfthe foot be cut ye must be the more dylygent and dredefull
to take it in cure.

Dfall manner of fractures brekynge of bones in general and how they shall be
ryghted and heled. Ca. lix.
OF the wou^des yt hap neth in ye soft me^bres I have said / as of the
skyn^e / flesh / veins synewes / unto ye bone So shall I write of ye harder
dele / or parts of ye body. And of all yt is cut with a sword / and yt the
flesh and the bone be through cut / that is called a wound with the fracture
or brekyng. and if ye bone be hurt with no cuttynge instrument / but with a clobbe
/ or staff / stone / or falling / or cast / or by him self / or by another /
it is called a fracture or brekynge of ye bones. Sometime ye bo ne breketh
ouertwharte yt in the fracture with the brekynge is no small pieces of the bone /
and yt comenly is called a fracture. and sometime ye bone is beten and hurt /
and is uneven broken with splenters yt one piece or many pieces depteth from other
/ yt is called frustralis / or ye bone broken with pieces. Sometime it is not
broken ouertwhart / nor with pieces / but it is rent in length / then it is
called Apertura or rent. The token of ye fracture or brekynge / if it be in
bread or in length / It is known well enough by the sight and by
understanding / as haly abbas and La^fra^. says / and can ye not se ye
fracture / ye shall know through selynge with your hand on ye bone (as Rasis and
Auice^. says) The pain of the bone as it is tow chyd / and the feebleness
thereof is a token of the fracture. And as there is in ye fracture splentes or
pieces / then ye shall feel by the pieces about ye fracture and it will prycke in
ye flesh and the pacyent feleth the pryckynge over the place of the fracture
/ and most wha^ you tow che it with your hand. The fracture or rynyng that
comes in the length of ye bone is worser to be known than the fracture yt
comes ouertwharte ye bone / but it is known for ye membre is greter and
thycker / and that the pacient with ye membre may not labor as he has done
before times. That bone yt is ouertwhart broken in. ii. pieces yt is more
peryllous to bind and to hold / than is the bone that is broken or rent in
ye length. Therefore as such a fracture is heled it is altymes vneue^ and
crooked / pryncy pally as the fracture is in a bone yt stands alone with none
other standing there by / ly ke as the formest bone in the arm / and in ye
shynnes. The fracture by the joints it is the heuyest and the worst to bind /
And yt can not well be bounden for there comes often times great pain in the
meuynge / and hardneth the fracture with pain and mar ring of the flesh /
And if it have much moystnes it is evil / because he can not be* helped for
the time ye fayntnes must be first amended. The fracture with a wound has a
sundry cure / and ye must make holes in the band / through the which it may
be heled where as need is. When any frac ture is long unbound it is dreadful
and ye worse. And if the fracture ware hard / than is it the worse to set to
gyder / and there fore it is needful to have a great strong byndyge / and the
great strong byndynge is peryllous sor coming onyhete and crampe (as Auicenna
says)

To know in what time the bones may be heled / that is to know. The braynnan
may be heled in. xl. days. The bone of the nose is heled in. xiiii. days. The
rybbes in xx. days. and so forth it shall be said hereafter. But the age of a
man takes away such comely time of helynge. Jamericus Auicenna / and haly
abbas says / what is the cause that the time is long or ye bones be heled to
gyder / It comes often times yt the bones be often times dressed / and
moystned with warm water / and with often ty mes meuynge / and that there is to
little sly my blood / and through strayte byndynge it beletteth the membre to
feed / and hyndreth him of his helynge. And it is said that the swellynge of
the membre wout great pain after ye byndynge / and slaketh the swellynge after
the time of the setting again of the bones that is a good token.

Item Galienus and Auicenna says to this fracture is. iiii. diverse manners of
helynge and byndynge / The first the broken bone to be made even / The other
set together again ye bone that is made even. The iii. is the byndynge with the
hole / The. iiii. to amend ye ill accide^te. And in ye first I will give you
that which is nedful to this work / first se that all thing be ready to the
setting in again. The other learning is to have a comely place / and a comely
servant. The. iii. is the white of an egg / so much as it is Enough / and
oil of roses / and depte therein a cloth / after the gretnes of ye member. The.
iiii. three bands long and broad after the member. The. v. is towe that is
soft and well heccled / depte in acicrata and wrong out again (As Ra.
^sayleth) The. vi. sple^tes yt beeue^ and smote / made of box or hard wood or
of horn / or of iron / or of lether after the member three fyngers broad over
ye fracture / and more if need be / as albucaiis says / and that it touch
thout uor hurts the joints in the mids thycker then in ye ends / and
thereof shall be laid as many as need is / and that may goo aborte ye member
covered with clothes washed in the white of an egg.

The. vii. if it be need ye shall have pypes with small cords to hynde so
much as needs after the length of the membre / ye sple^tes shall be boun de
with the cords and with the pypes / and bind it reasonably / and after draw
through the pypes small styckes so that ye pypes the not / and that ye dyndynge
lose not. The. viii. that ye have suspenioriu^ or canabulu^ therein ye member
right and surely is be set The. ix. ye bed there as ye pacyent lies yt it be
need / it must have a hole wherthrugh he may do his draught and therefore he
shall have a cord hanging above the bed / where with he may turn self. The
other learning is of ye maky^ even with. ii. servants / where of the one shall
hold and draw the member at one end. and the other servant shall hold, and
draw at the other end vpryght that it break not / and if they may not draw
it alyke with their hands / and the broken member stretche out / ye shall take
a gyrdell made therefore / or any other thing (As Ipocras said) but it were
very good to have a vice made therefore / that the bone might be preserved till
the member be bonnde / and the facyon of this same vice stands here in pycture



The. iii. learning that the holdynger of ye membre which is with byndynge and
ga derynge together / it shall be done softely with out any pain. Galienus says
/ they that bind / shall chose the best manner that there to belongs that the
lesser pain may be / for not hynge marreth so sooue the membre (...) the
pain does coming of the strayte vyndynge / and unreasonable handelynde /
Therefore mark well (that Guydo says) And in like wise I also have seen many
me^ bres that has been evil gnyded with esti omena and rottynge / Thereof
Rasys gives warning to the surgean for the byndynge that is lose bound it
holds not the bone / and the hard byndynge brings pain / and lets
food to come to the members / and the byndynge up must be as the pacye^t may
suffer withease (as Rasys says).

Ipocras commands to take. iii. bands. And the first band going upward
from the fracture which lets the coming down of the matter. The other
band is from the same place going downewarde and that thresteth the matter
out / and these two bands keeps to gyder the broken bone / and defends
that none impostuma cyon come thereto / but that is not ynowe / for ye third
band must be put thereto / whi che is bound for the keep the plumacyoles to
close it withal. Galienus commands to take Acerotum / wherefore now is
taken oil of roses. Also Rasys counsayleth that the fracture at the first
beginning shall not be bound to fast till the. vii. day. And on the. vii.
day. it shall be bound metely strayte / and in the first and the last end
bind it not to fast for fere of impostumacyon. The. iiii. learning is that in
the be gynnyng shall be laid good even splentes or other things in their
stead / not for to strain ye membre / but alonely for to keep it unto the
seventh day end / for fear that ^o impostnmacyon come thereto / than shall
yo^^ay thereon good strong splentes / that ye membre may be hold fast / and at
ye first time I take the good splentes / and bind them some what lose / that
no swellynge nor impostumacyon come thereto / And also do so to the last till it
be well strengthed / and be not hasty to take of the splentes (as Aup cenna
says in his book of Sargery.

The. v. lernyng and doctrine is of the ty me of chau^gynge or byndynge / or
dressyng The chaungynge shall not be done before the. x. xv. or. xx. day /
pryncypally as ye byndynge is dressyd with the oil aforesaid / And if the
fracture be not well and right set / or any strong accydente comes therein
the sooner it must be dressed. And if ye dres se the byndynge with the powder
as I shall learn you / so leave the byndynge thereon ye. ix. or. x. day. and long
abydyng in (...) a byndynge wichout chaungyng it is euy^^ (as Rasys says) But
if ye were in fear yt it is not well and right set / tha^ may ye chan^ge the
byndynge in. vii. days. and sometime sooner. and ye shall sometime change ye
byndyng. in. x. days. for cause than is yet there not come the porus. and is
than there any uneven than make it even yt it not pryc kyth nor stytchyd in the
fracture.

If pain / or impostumacyon / or other ill accydentes comes thereto / than may
ye change it at the. iii. day. But in other cau sys shall it not be changed
nor losyd up be fore the. vii. day. but if ye matter must be clensyd than ye
may the sooner change the byndynge and dressynge of the same.

The. vi. doctrine and learning is this ^itacyons of the porus / and it grow
that the^ ^day / and when it is comen ye shall strength him with meet and
drink / and Galienus says the body f^de with meet where in is great moystnes /
thereof comes not only good / but also (...) my moystnes / and thereof and
therout comes that couglutu (...) that is he lynge to gyder (as A uice^na
says like asrys rappe where / sodden heedes / and feetes of beestes / and
refrain wine. He shall be ware him for all things that bren neth the blood /
as strong wine / garlyke / onyons / mustatde / and well smelling spyces. And
Rasys says / in the beginning shall he change his rulynge / in drinking no
wine / and in going to chamber / and in lettynge blood / and there with shall be
lets the impostumacyon. and as he is sure of the impostume than may he
return again to his old rule. In the first return again to the making
even of the bones with drawing out the membre straight / and ^y^^e up the bone
that is pressed down / and threste down ye other bone that stands on hight
and do it without pain / unto the time the bones be knyt together in his right
place. The other learning is to be done with a good byndynge as many master
says / and some bind the fracture even with out splentes unto the fyfthe or
syxte day / some lays with plu macyoles of clowtes (as master Petrus) some of
tow (as Theodoric^) and they bind there upon the splentes / and these both
does h^me / for the plumacyoles should be somany that there should be no fast
byndynge and in a slyppe might the membre be hurt And Euydo follows after ye
said lernyng And at the first do that ye pain may be put away and keeping also
the membre. The second in keeping that the porus or co^glutinatiuum grows
about the fracture.

The third / that in keeping the membre shall be stretched and brought again in
his old workynge. Also there is. iiii. manners for to hele and bind this
fracture. The first as the fracture is ouert wharte / and if there be no small
pieces of bones to take out / than shall the fracture and wounded membre be
stretche dout and holde^ by your servants and to set right the broken bones
and do after the rule as I shall learn you / if there be any small ^^eces
departed fro the bone ye stycke in the flesh and is hanging on the bone set
them in their first place and bind them well together / make the small bones in
the muscles pain and cause them to follow the impostumacyon / than it is need
to cut the flesh on that place and take out the lose bones and than to make
ye member hole as I shall learn you / if the flesh be bruised with the
fracture of the bone / then shall the bone be bound with oil of roses and
shall lay on the powder of myrtylle beryes / and over the oil and powder
yeshallay a cloth depte in the white of eggs and oil of roses and bind it
softely / If ye fracture be without pain / and without small pieces of bones
and is well streyghtened / so shall you bind it with a long broad band after
ye dretnes of ye membre without being long of doing And your servant must
hold the membre while ye clowtes be laid between (as Galienus is wont to do*
the clowtes may not be to cowrse for yt lets the good byndyng and the same
clowtes should be depte in the white of eggs meddled in oil of roses / and
begin to bind up ye fracture with the ban^e going up and down / and let ye
band go enough on the hole part / and upon the fracture bind even without
pain / and upon ye band shall be laid. ii. dowble (...) depte and wrong out
again / and shall cover the hole membre and that the ends of ye splentes
hurt not the membre / and sow then the clothe about and thereupon lay the
splentes made of wood or of ledder and then bind it with pypes / then shall the
pacyent be laid in a still place where he may have rest / and if it be needful
ye shall let ye pacyent blood the other day / and give him a laxatyue in the
first days / and the byndynge shall not be chanuged in. x. or. xv. days /
without were any evil accydent coming thereto / or that the fracture be not
set well to gyder as is before said / and after the. iii. and. iiii. day ye
fracture shall be dressed / and bound as it was before. And if the time be
hot and there come a swellynge / or impostumacyo^ or any other / ye shall
occupy the oil aforesaid / and if he be sure of the evil accedent than shall
ye make this powder / whereof I have often seen great profit come.

A powder.
Take bol^ armen^ / ambra or walderote / of each. iiii. ounces / small barlye
mele. vi. ounces / meddled all to gyder. And I was wont to do thereto walstone.
iii. ounces / and they be brought out of Zwytselonde / or ex ^uincia
Heluetiarum.



Nota I have (...) and her de a surge an made his booste to hele in. viii.
days a parsoue that has broken his leg or arm. And this to prove a dogs
leg was broken / than meddled he this powder afor said with ye white of an
egg / and laid it on te dogs leg and splented it / and as ye. viii. days
were past / than took he the splentes of / and the dogs leg was hole.
Terfore this is my counsel to take this store for this cure. that powder
has such nature / if there come any swellynge to the bone at the first time
so gothe the swellynge shortly away with the said powder. The other manner is
that after the. xii. or. xv. days as porus begynue to come / that is to know
when the pain is gone / and there come none impostumacyon / and ye membre is of
good color / than shall ye take of the band / and wasshe the membre in warm
water and lay thervpo^ a clothe stryken / and bind it with all the bands and
splentes a foresaid / and bind it some what faster. The fracture shall be salued
and dressed the. vii. or. ix. day. or more unto the time that the bone be well
bound with that porus that is well known by me uynge and by the vnswellynge.
The. iii. manner is that the membre shall be washed all three days with good
wine wherein is sodden roses / wormode or abscintium in (...) tyne / oken wood
/ and bound with (...) dept in ye same wine and pressyd out (...) and bound
with. iii. or. iiii. splentes / (...) shall the membre be brought by little and
little to his old workynge / and at the last shall the membre be made soft
with Dyal the a / or oxcicrocium. The fourth manner is when the accydente is
coming / like if there were pain or impostumacyon / and if the pain or
impostumacyon be great / that take away or it be bound with the long band that
there to belongs. And if it were well bound after his belonging / and there
com an impostumacyo^ or an unreasonable pain / there with is the surgean
compelled ye member to open and to unbind / and to amend the accydent / and
to help the nature. And that membre shall bestyll vnboundetyll ye time the
accydent and pain be taken away Therefore must ye take away the pain (as (...)
says) with the saluyng of warm oil of roses. Or (as Guido says) with wolle
depte in oil of roses / and venegre / and laid there over. And if there com
scabbes or itchynge / than lose ye byndynge / and make ye bone moist with warm
water wherein is sodde^ a little salt and that membre there with embroced and drop
with the water from above on the membre Or salve the membre with un guentum
album / or populeum as is before says. When all the accydentes is taken away
tha^ turn again to the byndyng of the membre. If there be a wound where in
be small pieces of bones they must be taken out / and hele the wound as I have
said in the chaptre of broken bones. And after goo to the helynge as is before
said. As the matter comes out / make an hole in the band / where through the
wound may be cleansed.

Of the brekyng of the nose, Ca, lx,
MAnytymes is the bone of ye nose broken / and sometime beten flat / to which
brekynge as thereto betymes is taken head it may behol pen at his first
proporcyo^ but as it not be done betymes / it will be so every more still. There
fore it is needful for the wound of ye nose shortly to be taken head to /
and to be set in his stead. Therefore right it anon / for if it become hard /
that does the pacyent great pain as it shall beryghted again. And ye must
right the nose after this manner.

Take your fore finger of your lift hand or your little finger and put it in
his nose / and with your right hand threst up ye fracture / and lift up with
your forefynger the nose and set the bone in again in his right place / and
when ye have made it even / ye shall make a wtyeke of wax and meddle therein a
little powder of mastick / and drago^s blood made in small powder / and this
wyeke must be made like a candell and put it in ye nose. Wylhelm^ placentin^
makes an hard wyeke or tente of towe depte in oil ofroses / and cast thereon
this powder made thus.

A Powder.
Take Bolus armenus. ii. ounces. Myrtil lorum. iiii. ounces. Dragons blood /
Dragantum / Gommy arabici / of each half an ounce. and take clowtes and
plumacioles depte in whyt of eggs / and the powder strawed thereupon / and lay
it properly after ye form of ye nose / as I have learned you in the chaptre of
the wounde^ in the face. I^ ye cannot put the finger in ye nose / then make a
tente of wood covered with old lynns clothe depte in oil of roses and put it
in to the nose / and therewith threst upward in to ye nose / and with your
other hand threst downward unto ye time ye bone be brought in to his right
place again / than dress it with the white of an egg / and with that powder
as is before said / and about ye place stryke that defensyffe of bolo armeno
and oil of coses / and a little vynagre mydled with ye say of uyghtshawd or of
solatru^ in latyne. and do this every day. And when ye shall dress this nose /
first let him blood on the hand / or with boxces on the shulder or with
ga^ssynge / and with drawght going / with supposytoria or glysters / and yt
shall lyghten the pacyent sore. And as you dress him the second time renew
ye tente with oil of roses and with the aforesaid powder / And upon the nose
lay the foresaid powder of dragantu^ mydled with the white of an egg and dress
the nose therwyth at the. iii. or. iiii. day. And if the fracture or brekynge
of ye nose is sore wounded / sow the skin together as I have said in the
chaptre of the wound of the nose. And lay the powder upon ye wound / and hele
it as in the chaptre a foresaid. and dress the wound every day twyse / and
rule him with meet and drink / and pryncypally he shall drynk reed wine
mydled with water.

Of the brekynge and fracture of the brayn pan I have said in the chatre of the
wounds in the heed.

Of the brekynge of the Jawbone and tethes. Ca, lxi,
AS the chekebone is broken / ye shall take your finger of ye lift hand and
set it under ye mowthe of the pacyent / and set ye cheke bone even right to
gyder with your right hand and you shall know when they stand even / that is
as the syke tethes stand even like ye other hole tethes. Then take a sylke
threde. v. or. vi. dobble well waxed / or take a copper wire yt has ^en
^eneled in the fire / and or it be cold through brayde the tethes together in
like wise as the picture shows.



And after that take powder as hereafter follows meddled with ye white of an
egg / and stryke it upon a clothe like a plaster and bind it as is aforesaid
in the chaptre of ye wound in the chekebone. Or lay plu^oles with dowble fold
lynnen clothe / and thervpo^ lay sklentes made of ledder. Than shall you bind
it with one band / be^nynge behind the neck and coming on ye cheke / and
again under the eeres behind ye heed / and so bind it about the foreheed and
if it be needful wind it often about in the same manner till ye band be made
fast And the powder is made thus.

A Powder.
Take Mumie / Masticke / Boli armeni / Dragantum / Go^mi arabici / of each a
^ce. and made of these a powder / and ^ly let them blood / or bore them
garssy^ between his shoulders. And hold the rule of his drawght going with
supposytorye every day / and stryke about the fracture every day the
defensyuum, and his mete shall be bear and bread / or wortes / or thyn pappe /
till he be strong / and shall drink barley water / and after that reed wine.
And ye time of helynge is. xx. days (as Auicenna / and Albucasys says) If
there be any wound to be sowed / and the tethe to be set together ye must do in
all manner as I have said in the chaptre of the wound of the cheke, and the
band so bound that does no harm to the tethe. And he must every day take
(...) to the wound. And every third day (...) must take heed to the tethes /
and to ye band.

Of the brekyng of the neck and back bone. Ca. lxij.
PAulus (...) and Haly ^^bas says / In the spondyles or back bone commeth^
fracture or brekynge / but of strong strokes are fore bruised: and that is
deedly / and therefore (...) following after ye evil tokenyng and accydent and
hurtynge of nucha or mary of ye backebone yt comes from ye brain down (...)
through the backebone / for the brain may not suffer. Therefore says Paulus
Haly abbas and Albucasys / what accydente or pain comes to nucha and to the
synewes / that brengeth paralisis of the hands as it is in the vppermoost
part of ye spo^dyles. But if the pain be in the nether spondyles so comes
the paralisys in ye foot (as Albucasys says) As ye se the pacyente may not
g^^ to the drawght nor pysse as he would / it is deedly (as Albuca. says)
therefore ye shall not take that in cure. If there be no such accydente than take
it in cure and take away the impostumacyon and pain. Ye shall salve the hole
back without the fracture. And ye shall let them blood shortly on the hand
nere the thombe / and afterward set with your hand the bones and knottes of
the backebone as well as ye can / and on the frature lay this plaster following.

A Plaster.
Take Cyser meet / or Beenemeele / or mylstoffe meele. xij. ounces. Mastyck /
Draga^tum / Gomi arabici / of each. ii. ounces. Mumie / Boly armeni / of each
an ounce. and putt them to gyder and make it like a plaster / and after that
salve the fracture round about with defensyuu^ without vynegre / and dress
him every third day. And the pacyent shall lie on his one side / or on his
belly / and rule him going to the draught. If there be a wound wide with with
a great fracture it is deedly nevertheless s^we it. And if there be any bones
deperted / deperte them hole. And lay on the seem this powder following.

A Powder.
Take Drago^s blood / Mastycke / Draga^tum / Go^mi arabici / Mumie of each
anou^^ thereof make fine powder. And over that powder lay this plaster following.

A Plaster.
Take Masticke / Dragantum / Dragons blood / Go^mi arabici of each an ounce.
Mumye. ii. ounces. Rose honey. xii. ounces. Barley meele. vi. ounces. meddle all
these to gy^ and lay on the wound / and about the wound that defensiuu^ / and
do it so long till the bone be well fastened. And order him well in going to
the drawght / And diet him with mete and drink ^^it i^ (...).

Of the brekyng of the forked bone / and shoulder. Ca. lxiij.
THe fracture or brekynge of ye forked bone is sometime i^warde and sometime
outward and sometime even / nevertheless it is broken / The fracture that
stands inward and even / it is easy to be dressed downwarde / and as ye one
bone goes inward / and the other outward / that is hard to set in again.
And is there (...) ne ^^wed inward so that you lift ye (...) up on hight /
and search (...) one bone upon the / and so make them (...) / th^^ (...) you
dress him with this following.

A plaster.
Take the white of eggs (...) mele / barley mele / bolus (...) (...) in that
powder / and mydle them together / like and plaster / and lay it there under in a
sylte / and ye shall kept it like as there to belongs / or with plumacioles
depte in ye white of eggs / and as he is well bound and bestowed / so shall ye
make him an hard coshyn or (...) (...) of clowtes / and bind him under the
arm as high as it may be / and hang the arm in a towell on his neck. And
let ye byndyng lyetyl ye. iij. or v. day / and tha^ to ye. viij. day v. or.
vi. weke long / tha^ dress him every day / and at ye last lay thereupon an
(...). If the fracture be threst in / than it is needful that your servant
hold up ye (...) of the pacyent with the holl of the arm (...) chynge out / and
another sers^au^t shall ^ull against him to the heedwarde / than threst and set
in that bone in his stead with your hand and after that bind him as. I have
^ryde / or with plumacioles of towe or clowte depte in the white of anegge
strawed thereupon this powder following.

A Powder.
Take Boliarmeni. ii. ounces. Mumie. Masticke. Oragantum. Gu^mi arabici. of
each an ounce. than take the clothe depte in the white of an egg and straweth
with the powder aforesaid. Than (...) a lether in form of the bone / and
bind the done to gyder with the for said dept clothe / or plumacyoles / lether /
and powder / and let the byndynge lie on. iii. days. Than let him blood on ye
hand / and rule him in his going to the stole. and stryke about the wound
that defensiuu^ as is aforesaid. He shall drink barley water / and ete such me
(...) to make the bones strong * as is h^gges (...) well sodden / and pap of
^atche / for the moystnes of the (...) makes the bones hard and for all
broken bones (...) he mete is good. If the fracture or brekynge is with a
wound than ^yght the bone as. I have say^ before / and soqe ye wound in such
manner that you may l^ke to the wound at every day whyt out hurtynge of the
bone that is set in again / (...) fere of departing out again. And lay (...)
the wound the fore said powder. And the bones that thus is set again / must
every iij. day be dressed ones / and the wound every days. and afterward lay
in the wound rose honey with this fore named powder to ^se the wound / and as
it is (...) tha^ hele it as another wound. And every day about ye wound
stryke the defensiuu^ tire that yt be assure^d of the impostumacy^ let him
blood / and rule him to go to ye (...) And as he is strong give him reed wine
meddled with barley water / and his mete shall be cow^ flesh / for thereof
comes much moystnes that ye bones hold together. like hogs fetes /
partryches / s^ / (...) hens / and other like.

Of the brekyng of the shulder. Ca. lxiiij.
IF the shoulder be broken ye shall set your servant to hold the pacyent /
tha^ shall you with your one hand take the fracture / and with the other hand
hold the shulder / bone / and draw ye bones to gyder that they may come even
/ and lay upon the fracture the plaster the which I have learned you before.
And about the place lay the defensiuu^ / over the plaster of. iiij. fold
lynnen clothe / and lay over that a little fine towe and than splentes made of
lether and of wyllowe wood in the gretnes after the shulder bone / and over the
splentes towe dept / and bind them well / and order them in going to the
drawght / and dress them at every. iij. days ones / and as ye bones be well
fasteneth salve them with dyalthea / or with a falue that I shall hereafter
write in the chaptre of the brekynge of the rybbes. And ye time of fastenynge
of that shoulder bone is. xx. days (as Albucasis says)

Of the brekyng of the bone above the elbowe. Ca. lxv.
THe hygheste pype of the arm is called Adiutoriu^ / it is sometime broken
ouertwhart / sometime a length / and (...) me nyghe by the ioynte / and that is
evil to hele. Therefore I will give you the learning and manner how ye shall
every fracture and brekynge handell and help. The first ye shall have. ij.
servants. ye one shall hold the pacyent above the arm next the shoulder.
and the other by the hard and on the elbowe / and bid him draw it out by
little and little / and hold the pacient so fast that he styre not his arms.
After that take with both your hands ye upper most pype nyghe by the elbowe
an (...) it softely on all sides till that ye here the bone craks. and that ye
se the howynge of the arm even. And when ye know the fracture / first ye
shall take the powder in the. (...)* chaptre. yt is made of walstone / wall^ /
or ambra in latin* etc and the white of eggs / ba^des / splentes / pypes /
nedles / and oil of roses / and all that is needful. And wha^ you have all
your gere ready / and if the upper part of the arm be broken / set him in a
chair. And if it he in the leg / lay ye pacyent on a plain table / and one
of your servants to hold him over his belly / ye other servant to hold by
the shoulder / and the third to hold by the arm under ye elbow and bid him
hold fast till ye command him to pull. Then take that powder aforesaid in
the. lix. chaptre, so much till ye have enough / and mydle it with white of
eggs and do thereto alume as great as a wallnotte / and styre it well to
gyder like pappe Then take. ji. fold of lynnen clothe and let it be so broad
that it may come above and under ye fracture a quarter broad that is together
half a yard / and after that the pacye^t be great or little / and that same
cloth shall be a yard long in ye manner as I have written of the brodnes. The
clothe must be well stryken on the one side with the salve / and laid on a
bank. And ye must have a roll bound of. ii. fadume long / and a finger broad
/ and that must be rolled up / and be stryke^ a yard long with the forenamed
things / and lay it by the other salued band. And after that ye shall take
good splentes and thynne as I have before wryte^ and they must be bound with
small cords above / in the mids / and also benethe / and as ye will lace a
dowbled of some mannys / so shall ye lace the ^^len^es that the cords may come
without on the splentes / and let the splentes lie also next the cloth / ye
shall have also. iij. strong pypes of goos legs / or of elder pypes / and
^pype bound with a strong small cord an^ stycke goth troughe the pypes / and
as all this is ready / than command ye other servant that holds the arm by
the elbow or leg hand or foot / that he properly and styfly ^l / and in the
pulling set the bone even again and upon the other / and take heed that ye
knee / or elbowe / hand / or foot stand up right / and you with your flat
hand over the fracture stryke so that ye about nor under feel none uneven
place / then shall ye look if ye arm or lege be a straw bread longer then the
hole arm or leg is / if not it is right / I have seen a good master yt /
bound a pacyent thinking that ye broken leg was longer than the hole leg
/ and he bound him so / when he had laid him in his bed the leg was weary
short / then he asked me how that might be / I said / you have not laid ye
pacye^t even and hye enough with his hyppes which has dysceyued you / therefore
take he de when ye bind them lay them long on the board and stretche them out
/ and when he is so laid / then shall you se if the shynnes be crooked or not /
and when you have all things well marked / and all your gere is ready by you /
so bydyoure servants that they at all times hold fast / and beware of
shaking as it is possible / then after that do about the bone the strykynge
cloth / and lay it even without wrymplyng after that take the roll band / and
the last the small cords with the pypes / and as soon as that is done / than
turn ye vppermoost pype and threst that stycke through / then turn the
other pype / and after ye third pype ye shall know that the myddell pype over
ye fracture must stronglyste be turned / for to^ ye ye vtermoost pype hard /
and the myddelmoost not hard for so should ye blood run under the byndynge
and make the soon ^an impostumacyo^ and swellynge / therefore ye myddelmoost
pype shall first be bound. Will ye know if it be right bound about the
fracture or not / ask the pacyent if he have any pain in the bone or
styckynge in the fracture / If he say than that he has none / and thinks he
should thereon well go / and that ye^ the broken leg longer then the hole
leg / that is a sure token that the byndynge is very good / and if ye shynne
of ye leg be crooked like abowe and even wha^ ye have stryken over with your
hand and so fullfyll the crokednes with the pluma cyoles or with a fylte that
ye splentes may lie even on / and ye arms or legs shall (...) a (...) pype
so as I have learned in the (...) chapter / and take heed that the arm (...)
that he may not look in his hand / and ye leg that he may se the innerparte
of the (...)* Take heed therefore in the byndynge / for I have seen thereof much
harm But the old masters as (...) (...) (...) francus says. If any arm be
broken that shall ye know thus. Lay your one hand on the fracture and your
other hand under ye fracture / and your servant shall hold the pacyent by
the arm and by the elbowe / and tha^ shall ye the arm properly meue as I have
said before. And than yt may know why there it be broken or not / and if it be
broken lay thereon shortly this plaster following.

A plaster.
Take Mylstuffe meele / or Cycer meele / or Been meele or Barley meele. xij.
diuices. Masticis / Draganti Go^ arabici / of each. i^. ounc. (...) / (...) of
each one ounce. i^ is ^dled together with the white (...) / another of made a
plaster / and stryke it upon a lynnen clothe a^ have learned before and that
number shall be stretched bound with splentes / with cords / with pypes in all
manner as I have showed you. (...) take heed that ye bind not the membre to
fast for thereof comes great harm / and the membre lost. And with out taking
good head the pacyent is like to lose his ly^^. Also it is good to stryke the
defensiuum to defend the membre from all ill accydent that thereto might come.

A def^nsiuum
This defensiuum shall be made of Oil of roses / Boloarme no / Uynegre /
nightshed sap or liquor solatri in latin / or sap of hou^^eke / And let the
pacyeent s^tely on the vain blood, and that he hold his go^ynge to the
drawght. and he must also been his arm in a towell about his neck. and he
may be heled in. xiiij. days. And if there be any broken bone in the wounds ye
must take heed thereto. Or if there be ^bones departed into that shall you so one
take out as I have learned you in the chaptre of ye wound in the arms. And
some Surgean weneth that the pacyent should dye when ye mary comethout of the
bone / that is not so A good cause why / for as ye flesh grows so grows
the mary. And after that ye sow the wound / and (...) thereto every day as In
the. xiiij. chaptre have said. And you shall or deyne them it that ye splentes
couere not the wound / and upon this wound ye shall straw every day this
powder.

A Powder.
Take Mastyke / (...) ye of araby of each. ij. ounces / Mumie / dragons blood
(...) an ounce / This powder has (...) power to hele and to make strange the
bones and to cause them to grow together and over this powder lay that
mundificatiuum / made of rose honey strayned. xij. ounces / Barley mele or my^le
hou^ ounces and of ye foresaid powder in ounces / and (...) together / and
thereof make a plaster and lay it every day to ye wound / and as the wound is
beeit cleansed so shall ye hele it with a grene wounded plaster / and with^s
powder made of cypres nottes / gall appeles / (...) fra^ke^sence / of each. i^
made (...) made well granat powder which (...) the flesh (...) and lay over
it a grene wounded plaster.

Of the brekyng of the arm byneth the elbowe. Ca. lxvj.
IN the nether (...) of the arm is. ij. pypes (...) it happens ye one is
broken / and sometime to the / and sometime it is bowed in the flesh without
brokynge (...) pla^ says) ye fracture of the vnderpype is wors then yt (...)
pype (As auicenna says / and Alb^ also) and if they be both broken it is ye
wors yt which ye may know by the feeling. if ye bones be broken then it
cracked / and is it only bowed then it cracked not. And if both ye pypes be
broken / so must you have; ij. serpents yt one shall hold the pacye^t by ye
elbowe and the other by the hand and let the forehande strange downwarde to
the ground / and as it shall be drestyd it shall not living town. but do as I
have showed before. Or ye begin ye must have all your gere ready that is
needful as I have aforesaid. And as all is ready / take the pacyent before you
/ and commau^nde your (...) to (...) him as is aforesaid / and set the bone
with your hand softely together in ye best manner that ye can / and do not the
patient to much pain in the setting in of the bones / because ye through
such pain all the moystnes dy^e^deth in to the arm / and so might thereof come
much harm / whereby he should be in peril of death And when ye have set the
arm together after your best manner / take a long broad ba^de depte in oil of
roses and threst out again and bind ye arm therewith / and defend ye arm
from moystnes and impostumacyon / and take away the great pain. and after yt
dress him as I have aforesaid. The young parsone that can not take heed to him
self dress him with that powder and the whyt of eggs as I have aforesaid If
the one pype is hole and the other is broken / work therein as they were both
broken so as I have aforesaid / then alone ye need not to have so many
splentes. And when ye have them well dressed let them take heed of blood lettynge
/ and to the draught going. And after yt the arm shall be salued with the
defenssuu^ that ye be sure of the sw^rynge and of ye impostumacyon / and bring
the arm in a towell about his neck and make a board and lay thereon a co^yn
taht the arm may thee on rest. If there be a wound with ye fracture ^ake head
that ye bone fyt again And if there be any bones departed take it soon out /
and then (...) your sple^tes thereafter / and bind it well / so that ye may se
ye wound / and if it be need sow ye wound / and let the one end be open
wherthrough it may be cleansed. And lay on the seem ye foresaid powder / and the
foresaid mundificatiuum plaster that I in the chaptre before have learned / and
do therabout the defensiuu^ / and hele it as you hele another wound / as I
have learned in the next chaptre. And so let rule them of mete and drink / and
going to the draught / as is aforesaid.

Of the brekyng of the fyngers / or Joyntes. Ca. lxvij.
IN the hand there is. iiij. bones. In every finger iij. bones. and for their
final nes and strength they a seldom broken. And if it happen yt they break /
take heed that ye set them together after the best manner yt you can. Albucasis
says that ye shall stretche the head upon the table / and threst it in again /
and ye shall lay thereupon the plaster aforesaid in ye. lxv. chaptre. and in
this brekinge is no need to lay thereon clothes with oil of roses / but alonely
the plasters or the powder of walstone / as I have said in the. lix. chapter
mydled with the white of an egg / lay the plaster on both sides of ye hand /
and thervpo^ lay splentes and towe after the length and bread of the hand /
and afterward bind ye hand well after ye best manner / and on ye hand towe /
or an eue^ board yt the. iiij syngers be together / and ye palm of the hand /
and the fyngers shall be filled with towe or with some other thing / and bind ye
hand so (...) splentes may come to the half arm without and within / and when
that is done salve ye arm about with ye elbowe with the defenciuum as is
aforesaid / then hang the arm in a towell or a cloth about his neck / if the
fyngers be broken / make ye splentes so long as the fyngers and more yt it may
come in ye mids of the hand / and bind with ye plaster as I have learned you
in the chapter of the vppermoost pype of ye arm / these bones shall be dressed
every. iiij. day ones / and at every time shall y^ salut it with desenciuum /
and let him hold the rule of going to the draught / And if ye fracture be
with a wound / then dress the wound every day / and lay there upon a cloth
depte in oil of roses and lay therein ye powder of mumie / drago^s blod like as
I have learned in ye. lxv. chapter / and lay therouer the same plaster in the
chapter aforesaid / and I was wont to take elder pypes / and lay the finger
therein / and it is very good yt ye bind the hole finger with ye wound fyngers
/ and so gets the wounded fyngers quyckenes with the hole finger.

Of the broken bones in the breast. Ca. lxviij
THe breast is set together of. vij. bones and they be fastened with vij. rybbes /
therefore take heed in what place the bone is broken / lay your hand thereon and
feel if it be broken / and if it crake it is broken / and if not be broken but
so (...) bowed in / the^ take heed if he perbrake blood / for and if he
perbrake blood / it (...) evil token that there is some veins broken And if not
but is otherwise broken / the take your hand and threst upon the (...) place
that the bone come in again. Or (...) upon the fracture a great (...) or bore^
out pryckyng (...) pulls out the bone again. And that so done sayther^ this
plaster / which has the strength to ca^ wed bones to come out again.

A Plaster.
Take Cy^ mele / or been meel. xij. ounces Draganti / (...) arabici / of (...)
ounces. Bolo arm^. iiij. ounces. and make these together in (...) powder mydled
with the white of eggs / and thereof make a plaster and laid thereon / and
dress them it every iij. days ones. And as ye have bound them first let them
be let blood out of the (...) of the liver on the hand between the small
finger and the golden finger, and salve the place with defensiuu^ therein is no
vynegre / for the vynegre is cold / and the bones therein is subtyl / and let
the vynegre (...) and hold the pacyent going to the drawghte, and make the
place strong in this salve.

A Salve.
Take Masticke / and ^ankensence / of each (...) ounce / (...) BOlus (...) / of
each. (...) ounces. (...). (...) ounces / wa^e ij. ounces. (...) iiij. ounces.
Oil of olyue. xij. ounces, (...) the ware and roiyll with the oil by the fire /
and than strain it and ye other substance made in powder (...) therein / and
meddle them well together / and salve the place every day (...). And rule him with
mete and drink / as I have learned before.

Of the brekyng of the rybbes. Ca. lxix.
E shall know that there is xij. rybbes. vij. long and. v. short / and the
short rybbes break not nyghe by the back / ye other. vij. rybbes break in
many places / and they be so^time crooked and bowed inward and is not broken /
and sometime outward also / and sometime ye fracture is deedly by long
endurynge of pain / and sometime it is not deedly and shortly heled / and this
ye may know hereafter written / the first ye must with your hand feel the
broken place / and if there be any crackynge then is it broken / and if there
benone evil accedence to se it is good to help / and as they bow inward so
be they evil to help / And if the rybbes be far sonken in / that the
me^bres be sore wounded inward it is deedly / or el les long sykenes / and
that may be known by the short brethe / and by blood spyttynge coghynge with
the stytche and pain in the side / thereof often comes great pain to the
rybbes / and to help the foresaid rybbes is evil to do and bring to pass /
come^ly as they break the will depart or be bowynge the one part inward / and
the other outward / and that inward is evil to bring again to his place /
and some parsones says yt the pacyent should ete such meets which should
cause him to swell and to fill him full of wind by yt which ye rybbe should be
dryue^ again in to his right place / and some says to set on them ventoses or
boxes whereby ye rybbe should come outward / but it is to doubt yt by that
workynge of the bentoses or bores should come more harm. Therefore dy^ death the
old doctors in this cure. And ^ly abbas / Albuca. Auice^na / and (...) other
have given many a cure to these. Auice^. Albucasys / they take thereto only /
wol^ / oil powder / and bands. Rogerius brengeth it in again to his place
with cleuynge plasters cha^^ed against the fire / or in bathes and after that
he makes ye rybbe fast. And Brunus makes that it comyth outward eue^ / and
he lays thereon a plaster with splentes as thereto belongs / and that part that
is bowed inward he makes moist. Auice^. occupied woll / oil / to a small
inbowyng but and if it be great he pulls it outward Milhelmus de Salice to
makes eue^ with his hands / and with the white of an egg and meele / and
with things laid thereon plaster wise. Lancfrancus did as Roger but he
commanded that the pacyent shall be helped with koughynge and nesynge to threft
the rybbe out. Guydo does as Brunus / as the fracture comes outward / and
after yt he lays a plaster thereupon with the whyt of an egg with meele and
other conglutinatiuum / with flocks / or with towe / and splent^ it with a
piece of hard lether / and byndeth the place ^ast with a long band / and at
ye last he softeneth the fracture with ^yalthea / or with oxicrato. But if the
fracture gothe inward / do as Rogerius and La^frances did. and if it be
needful tha^ he opens the fracture / or set thereupon a ventose or a box.
Thereafter he laid upon yt side on the fourth or fyfte day the white of an
egg / and oil of roses with towe for to drive away the pain and
i^postumacyon / tha^ he bound it with a light byndynge / but reasonably to
hold the medecyne. Then may ye rule the fracture with a plaster of been meel
and honey / and the raster soft it with Dyalthea / or with Occ^^rato. Or lay
thereupon this plaster when ye have made it again even.

A Plaster.
Take Cycer meele / or Mylstoffe meele / or Been meele. xii. ounces. Masticke
/ Dragantum / Gummi arabici / Mumie / Boli armeni / of each anou^ce. powdered
and mydled with the white of eggs / and so lay it thereon / and salve it
roundaboute with the desensinu^ / then bind it and let it lie so. iii. days.
and let him blood on the hand / and rule him in going to the draught. and
cause him to lie hye / or upon his belly. And when ye have fasteneth all the
rybbes / salve them with this salve in the stead of Dyalthea and occicrato.

A Salve.
Take Rosell. vi. ounces. Uaxe. ij. ounces. Bdellii / Apoponati / of each an
ounce. Mastick / Frankensence / of each. ii. ounces. Dragons blood. Mumie of
each an ounce. Oil olyue. xvi. ounces. weke the Bdellium and thereafter in the
oil also / and do therein the other things made in powder / and mydle it so
together / and therewith salve every day the place of the fracture. for this
salve dryueth away the pain / and takes away all hardness. yt more over in ye
beginning how the ventoses or boringe more draws / the more moystnes sends
the nature thereto.

Therefore ye must regard if the pacyent be full of flesh and moystnes so let
him blood on the other side against the fracture on the vain Basilica. and
thereafter on the same side of the fracture. But if ye pacye^t be lene work
after the learning of Rogerius / Jamericus / and La^frances / and anoynte your
hand with Turpe^tyn / or with melted pytche or with other clyuynge things / and
it shall be done in a bath / or by a fire / and lay it on the part yt is bowed
inward / and ye other hand on the part that stands outward for to threste
it downwarde / and with pulling of the adiutorium or arm pype of ye body /
with koughynge / or holding in the wind. and quyckely pull your hand upward
as often as the koughe / and holding of wind comes / for it pulls out ye
rybbes. But if it may not be so / and that ye pacyent be leave / or yt ye be in
fere / than ye shall follow the workynge of Auicenna. with setting the
ventoses or boxes. and as the rybbes be brought again in to their right places
/ so shall you bind it with towe depte with ye white of an egg meddled with meele /
or with the plaster of Mumie as I have learned. And when ye have thus wroght and
ye pain swage not away nor ye rybbe will not come out again / and ye coughe
and pain / and the stytche increases / and the blood lettynge is done / and
the accede^ce comes thereto / so must ye cut on the rybbe / and vncouere the
flesh fro ye rybbe / and take it away with your instrument / and ye shall lift
upward the rybbe again / for to compelle the coming of the accedence / and
afterward ye shall hele it like another wound / and to hold the rule of one
pleutericus till the axes and evil accedence be done.

Of the brekyng of the hyppes. Ca. lxx.
THis bone is broken sometime by strokes / and sometime by falling / and sometime
cloven / and sometime bowed inward This fracture is known by feeling with your
hand in the strykynge over / if ye find any vneue^. If the bone cleue / lay
thervpo^ this plaster. Been mele dragantum / mastycke. etc. as I have before
said / and lay thereon plumacioles of towe or of lynen cloth and with sple^tes /
and bind it with a band about the body / and than so we it as often as it
goth about / and at every sowynge set on a splente / and so let it lie. v.
days / but not so long if it happen that the pacyent be come syke or any evil
accedence come to him / Je shall let him blood between the little synger and the
gold finger / and hold the rule of going to the draught so yt he abide thyn
in his belly / and if ye know by the foresaid token that the bone is broken it
is need that ye bone be threst downwarde and set again vpryght with ye help of
your servants / and that so done / lay thereupon the foresaid plaster and
plumacyoles / and the splentes shall be so great yt the bone may be touered
withal / Over the splentes lay other splentes / and depte towe threst out
again / and the^ lay over yt your byndynge with your best manner / and salve
with that defe^siuum / and let the byndynge lie till ye iii. or. iiii. day be
past. Je shall let him blood and prycke on his back / and rule him with mete and
drink as I have often said to you before.

Of the brekyng of pypes about the kne. Ca. lxxj.
AS ye know by the feeling of ye bone whether it be broken with a wound / or
without a wound If it be broken without a wound / so is it nedeful to make
all your gere ready yt thereto belongs / as I have learned you in the. lix.
chapter / then shall ye set the bone together again / as I have learned you in
ye. lxv. chapter / in the brekynge of the arms and of ye legs / and as the
bone is well set together / then shall you deep ye clothe in oil of roses / and
wind it well about the leg or take the powder of walstone so as I have
learned so shull you take the oil and the plaster made of been mele / as I
have often learned you / with the white of an egg stryke^ on a cloth and lay
over ye ba^des splentes small cords and pypes / as I have plainly learned you
in ye lxv. chapter of the brekynge of the arms about the elbowe / your bands
and sple^tes shall be so ordained and to close the bone / and hole it to gyder
/ and take heed yt ye the bone bind not to styffe / whereby thereto may come no
swellyng nor other harm for that is to be fered / for they be daedly tokens /
now as all things is well done / so shall ye ye pacyent command to lie
down / and he shall not meue. Also ye old masters dyscordeth how the
pacyent shall lie / Rogerius / Al bucasys / and wylhelmus / lay them in an eue^
place or bed / and wyndeth his leg softely with clothes and tow^ / and some
other masters / as master Peter / he has. ii. long splentes to the end of
ye foot that is wound with lynne^ clothe and byndeth thervpo^. iii. or. iiii.
bands / Auicenna / Brunus / and Rogerius / splenteth with. ii. long sple^tes
bound to the foot / But Lancfrancus and the young masters lay the leg
alonge / and all the masters menynge is that the broken leg shall be laid
eue^ to rest without ouy hurtynge that it shall not be moved / and the pacyent
shall not move on no side / and also thereof spreketh Rogerius to ye work
master that he shall keep straight the membre and save his health / and also of
a more surety Romanus lays ye pacyent on a small bed / under the which bed
is an hole through the which he may do his water / and easement without
lyftynge of him self / and he must be bound to. iii. or. iiii. places of ye
bedstede and ye hole foot must be bound to the stock that ye pacyent may not
draw it up to him and Guy do byndeth him with long splentes / and lays on
him awayght and byndeth to his foot a plomet of lead / and as all this is
ordained and done / so shall he hold and rule as I have said in ye. lix.
chapter with blod lettynge / draught going / and with eating and drynkyng /
ye shall dress him dylygently. iiii. v. or. vi. days together / with out he be
very syke / and at every dressynge / ye shall look well on the leg how it is
dys^osed / and if it be not set vpryght / take head and give him his right form
/ therefore take ye head in ye first begynynge / for if it should stand long /
it ware hard to make it up right / is there one wound great / then se if there
be any bone deperted that take away / and sow the wound / and on ye seem
straw that powder that belonght thereto / as in the xiii chaptre is said / and
as ye the membre has set up right well together / than take wode splentes
after the degree of the wound and that the splentes towche not the wound /
when ye bind the leg / and also that ye may every day se to the wound / and
on the wound lay the aforsayd powder yt be laid upon the seem and upon that
powder lay ye mundificatiuum plaster.

A Plaster.
Take rose honey streynyd. xii. ounces. Barley meele / Mylstuf meele / or other
like. xii. ounces / of this powder that lies on the some. take. ii. ounces.
and meddle this together and as the wound with this plaster is cleansed / than
hele it with the grene woundyd plaster / and with powder of Cypressenottes /
Mumie / Franke^sence / Gall apple / of each ii. ounces. and on the seem lay the
powder of Dragons blood / Draga^tum / Go^my of Arabice / of each like much /
and all this mydle together.

Of the brekyng of the knee shyue or whorle bone. Ca. lxxij.
When the knee shyue is broken / then set it again ^p right with your hand in
the best manner as it can be than lay thervp ye plaster made of Barley meele / or
Been meele / and Dragons blood etc. (...) ye shall not lay there on the clothe
dept in rose oil / and as the plaster is laid thereon / than stryke there about
the Defensiuu^ / and thereafter lay upon it Plumacioles of tow / and thereafter
splentes / and the rouer bind it well with ye band and sow the band with whyt
thread / and let him blood on ye hand / between the little finger and the
golden finger / and rule him in going to draught / and with meet and drink /
as is a foresaid.

An instrument to make a crooked knee right.



Of the brekyng of the shynne. Ca. lxxiij.
IN the shynne be. ii. bones sometime they be broken both / sometime brekyth the
great pype / sometime the little pype. As the great pype is broken / then is
ye fracture behind. If the small pype is broken / tha^ the fracture is before
on the shynne / but the great is more peryllous tha^ the small. And as they
both be broken that is most peril Then it is needly to have al your gere ready
by you that thereto belongs or serves.

Than must ye have. ii. servants / the one to hold the knee / and the other
the fete. and command to pull in all manner / and to be ready as I have learned
you in the. ixv chaptre. of the brekynge of the arms. feeling with your hand if
it stand vpryght / and look if the broken leg is a little longer than the
hole leg. In like wise look if the hole leg is crooked or not. And bind it
than will, a clothe depte in oil of roses / or with ye powder of waltstone /
with ye baundes and sple^tes. And the splentes must be longer in the brekynge
of the leg than in the brekynge of the arm. and with the small cords / and
pypes. Je shall ask the pacyent as it standyth in the same chaptre / yt ye may
know if it be right bound or not. And take he de that ye bind him not to
styfe / whereby the pacyent might come in great harm / pain and fere. And
should him bring in paralisys / and the pacyent might also by the hard
byndyng lyse that membre. And defend the place with the defensyuum. and beware
you of the hard byndynge. And let him blood on the hand / and hold him in ye
rule in his drawght going. And ye shall dress him in. iij. or. iiii. days
onys. If that leg be broken with a wound / than look if there any bones be
beparted / they shall be taken out. And fere you not if ye mary goth therout.
Sow the wound / and than make vpryggt the bone again / and set it to gyder
and make splentes / but do so that ye may se to the wound at every day. To
these brekynge of the leg be sundry manners of sple^tes. Je shall make a hole
form after ye gretenes and length of the leg / there as the iegge shall be
laid in with ye byndynge This wound is sore deedly / but fere not so much
the fracture as the wound. It is nedeful to defend the wound from the
impostumcyo^ with the defensyuum / and mundificatiuu^ / that no great moystnes
nor swerynge come thereto / for the pacyent might thereof dye.

Therefore it is nedely to look thereto at every day onys / and tha^ if irnedyth
the bone shall be ryghtyd without pain. And upon the seem straw the powder of
the sowynge Than hele the wound / like the wound with the brekynge of the arm
/ or in the shulder and rule the pacyent in etynge and drinking as I have
often aforesaid.

Of the bone brekynge in the calfe of the leg. Ca. lxxiiij
SEldom is broken the bone of the calfe / for it is an hard bone / and is
defendyd with the strings and synewes (as Guy do says) but Wylhelmes said If
it happens that the bone of the calfe be broken / that shall be kowen with
feeling. And that bone breketh sometime with strokes / sometime with falling /
than help him thus.

A Plaster.
Take been meel / or Cycermeel / or mylstuf meel. xii. ounces. mastick /
Dragantu^ / Go^mi arabici / of each. ij. ounces. Bolus arm nus. i. ounce. all
this made in small powder than mydle it with the whyt of eggs / and lay it on
the fracture / and therouer the sple^tes with tow. and therouer the band / and
sow it with a threde at each wyndynge of the band. And the band shall go
round about the hole foot / and round about the half leg and salve the foot
with the defensiuum / and rule him as is aforesaid.

Of the brekyng of the bone abowe upon the foot. Ca. lxxv.
AS raseta that is the bone of ye foot is broken it is hard to hele like
Auice^na wrythet / and thereto comet ofte^tymes ill accede^s. ye breking (as
albucasis said) shall be helped thus / set the foot of the pacyent on the
ground / and lay ye bone right as it best may be done / tha^ splente him with
a broad splent after ye sole of the foot / and lay on the fracture the
foresaid plaster made of that powder meddled with the white of an egg / over the
plaster lay splentes with towe / dept in the white of an egg / than shall ye
set the foot on a soole of wood / and about the foot stryke that defe^siuum
/ than bind the foot and pull therouer a sho of fy^t / and let him blood / Is
the wound with a fracture tha^ bind him every day onys or dress him / and
lay on the wound this plaster.

A plaster.
Take Mastyck / Dragantum / Gommy of Arabyci of each. ii. ounces / Mumye /
Bolus Armenus / of each one ounce / This powder meddled with rose honey / and
make thereof a plaster / there with the wound shall be cleansed / there after hele
the wound with a grene wounded plaster / and over the plaster lay a clothe
dept in warm rose oil / or in warm wine / for the warm wine does strong /
the flesh growyng as over the powder be laid the plaster / his meet and drynk
shall be as is a foresaid / ye joints of ye toes shall be ryghted again like as
the Joyntes of the fyngers. As Haly wrythed.

Of the bowyng of the bonys without brekynge. Ca. lxxvi.
THe bowynge of ye bonys happens sometime with falling and sometime with
strokes. or with cuttynge without brekynge as the bowynge on the cheke than
cirest it outward with your hand and fyngers / as I have lernyd in the
chaptre of the brekynge of the rybbes. in ye. lxix. chap. and the other hand
shall be salued with turpentyn / or pytche / and lay it without on ye cheke bone.
and with the other hand^ ^rest it softely from within outward / and take away
with have your salued hand fro his cheke. In like wise do in the bowynge of ye
rybbes. but in the bones of the shine or arm must ye have a good byndynge /
and strong splentes / that with the thressyng of the byndyng may be ryghteth the
bone again. and the bone in the arm or leg shall be stretchyth out by little
and little. but that member shall first be batheth in water therein is sodden
Camomyll / Pappyll / hye malowe Fenygreke / Lynseed. And than salve it with oil
of Lylyes / or Capons grese / or Duckys grese. And it is often proved / and it
helps much / as upon the bowynge be laid a piece of an Olyphantes tethe /
for ye yuore bone pullyth to him the bowyd bone / and therewith the bone gets
his right form.

Of the dyslocacyon or dysmenbrynge of every joint in general. Ca. lxxvij


AUicenna says / the dyssocacie or dysmembryng is an outgoyng of ye bone out
his right place there it was set in before. And the settinge of the bone is in.
iiij. manners. that also Lanfranc. Wilhelmes / and other masters says. The one
is after the manner of a saw with the tethes set in to gyder and so closing / as
be the. vi. bones of the braynpan. The other. as ye one bone in the other
standed and is there in set / as the tethes in the cheek. The. iij. is one
hanging or lenynge bone on another bone as the. vii. bones of the breast. The.
iiij. manner. the one bone is joined with another / and bound to gyder with the
synewes / where through the meuynge of the body comes. This gaderyng of ye
bones is called a ioynte or member. In this last manner is done ye very
dyslocacye / but in the other it is not be done / but there happenyth a
dysmembrynge This dysme^bringe is in iiij. manners. forward / behyndeward /
inward / and outward Also is some simple / some with a fracture / and pain and
impostumacyon / and some with hardness. After this dyuersyte be diverse cures. And
the dysmembryng happens sometime without / as with falling / smytyng or with
unreasonable pulling. Some dysmebrynge is inward^ / as the ^ymy humors in the
ioynte be holden. The token of the dismembrynge of the joints is known by ye
hyghnes / or holnes on the other part. The dysmembrynge with a wound / pain
/ or impostumacyon is heavy and peryllous / so ye member bydeth sometime crooked
without tournynge again in his right form (as Galienes wrythet in quarto
Therapentice) The old and hard dismembring is for (...) heavy and shantely to
help / and ye must t^^ membre set in again with good manner / (...) with the
lest pain as hastily as it may be done Some dysmembringe is lyghtely to set in
again / as the joint of the hands. Some dysmembrynge is heavy to set in again /
as the elbow / the foot / and the fyngers.

Some is between both / as the shulder and hyppes. The incomynge of the membre
is known by herynge of the crakynge in ye incomynge of the bones and as ye se
that it is come in his right place in the other bone The comen cure of all
dysmembrynge in the joints is in. iiij. manners. beside the lerninge that I
have given you in the chaptre of the comen brekynge in the bonys. The first
manner / is the setting in again ye ioynte. The ^de is fast making of the
membre that there is setin again. The. iii. is defending of the pain and
impostumacyon. The. iiij. is mendynge of the ill accyde^tes. The first is done
in. iij. manners. The first. that ye have all thing ready by you yt is needful
to you as I have learned you in ye lix. chaptre. of all fractures in the bouys
in comen or ye begin ye membre to setin again The other / that ye ye membre not
bathe nor wasshe in warm water (as Auicen. says) that no impostumacyo^ come
thereto / nor let tynge to setin the membre again. Lancfra^cus and Wylhelmus de
saliceto says / that some the dysmembryng as it is fresshe / than they lay that
membre in warm water a long time / and than they setin ye member again and
this shall ye not do. but is the dysmembrynge some days past / than may ye
bathe the joint in warm water therein is sodden Papple / Camomylle / Hye malowe
/ fenygreke / and than shall it be setin again.

The. ii. manner is done in. ii. manners. The first. as the setting in of the
ioynte is small and light / than is Enough to lay thereon a clothe depte in oil
of roses / and there with salued the ioynte / and over the clothe tow dept in
white of eggs. than bind it with a band that thereto belongs. The other. is
ye membre great and strong / and the set tynge in is heavy / and ye fere the
going out of the joint again / than ye must you provide better / therefore
anoynte the ioynte / and lay thereupon this plaster following.

A plaster.
Take Mylstur meell. vi. parts. Drago^s blood / Franke^sence / Masticke /
Satcocol le / of each one part / all this made in po^^d and meddled with the
white of eggs / and stryke it upon a clothe / and lay it on ye ioynte and
plumacioles oft^w or clothes. If it be needful than splente it with lether /
and bind it with a band of lynnen clothe after the greatness of the membre /
and bind it stetly that it meile not in no side / and that the band hold it
fast / but take heed thereto that ye fast byndynge make not ill accidence. The
iii. manner. is the bloody uyng and laxatyre if it be need / and a good diela
in the beginning to the time till the pain and imposin macyon is driven away /
than shall ye dieta be stronger / as I have aforesay deu^ the lix. chap. and
that thereto come no yl^ accide^te / than shall the first byndynge be still un
to the. x. day. And some other leave it to the v. or. vii. day. and in the end
shall the bre be made strong with sedynge or (...) sing of roses / and
worwood / and with a Chyreclothe / or with oxcierato / and ye member shall be
brought again in his first stre^gthe and workynge. The. iiij. manner is. as there
is evil accide^tes / pain / or i^ol^u macion / that it may be driven away or
the dislocacie be set in again / for much handelynge it is to fere coming
thereto ye cramp or other accydentes / and it shall be done with woll depte in warm
water / and lynseede oil / than it be brought to his first nature (as
Albucasis says) Is the dyslocacyon with a wound / than shall ye shortly it
set in again / and cure ye wound / and if it ^e dyth sow the wound / and
there shall be let on the wound a hole open for clensyng out the matter. Is the
dyslocacie with a fracture / than dress first the dyslocacie and tha^ the
fracture / is it possible. If it be not possible do the contrary. Is the
dismembrynge out / and is there hardness / than must ye bathe it as is aforesaid.
and salve it (...) dial thea / and plaster it with dyaquilo^ magno / kemdewolle
deped in mustilaginibus / yt is the slyme of papple / lynseed / fenigreke /
roots of the papple sodden / and stamped with grese / and as the place is well
wekyd than pulle the membre inagayn / and bind it as I have said before.

Of the dyslocacie of the Jawbone. Ca. lxxviij.
OF this dismembryng of the Jawbone is in. ii. manners. The one / as it gothe
forward out of the joint / than bydeth the mouth open. The other. as it is
behind / than comes the upper most tethe over the undermost / and tha^ ye can
not open the mouth. The tokens of this dislocacie without the common tokens is /
that the tethes come not like on the other. And if it not hastily is setin
again / it will be hard and brengeth axcys / pain / and ill acci^^t and does
the parsone dye within. x. days. (as Auice^. and Haly abbas says) As the
dislocacie happens behyndewarde / tha^ it shall thus be setin again. The
servant must hold the heed of the pacient / than put your thombe in his mouth
well behind / and your other fingers under the cheke / and threst (...) your
thombe downewarde / strongely pulling to you / and lift up with your fyngers
that it may come^ in / thereafter salve it with dyaithea. Is the dislocacie
before / than lays Wylthelm? and Lanfrancus a strong band under the chyne
which may keep ye hole chyne / and a small stycke as deep in his mouth as it
may be done / than they pulls the ends of the band styfly upward / and
hold the knee on the pacyent. And the pacient must lie high with the shulders
(as Jamerices says) and so shall it be brought in by the grace of god. Than
lay thereon this plaster following.

A Plaster.
Take Brenmeel. xii. ounces. Dragantum Gommi arabici / ^astick / Bolus armen^.
of each ij. ounces. this drive to gyder in powder / and mydle them with the
white of eggs / and stryke it on a clothe / and lay it the ron. Than wind it
about (...) abande / and dress it every two days onys. And it is wou^t to be
made fast in. xiij. days / or there about. Lay the pacyent on a styfe heed
pyllow. He shall ete soppys / pappe / yt them need not to chaw If it has be
long time out of the ioynte / and is it become hard / than shall ye bathe it
(...) warm water / and oil / and with other conveniently things / as I have
learned before in ye next chapt. than shall it turn again in his place.
Comyth thereto any ill accydent / tha^ help him as it nedith / and against the
pain shere of his here. And salve the heed with warm oil of roses behind
the eerys / and behind in the neck / and under the arm of the pacient.

Of the dysmenbrynge of the neck and rygbone. Ca. lxxix.
Sometime is the dysme^brynge of ye rydgbone outward / sometime inward / sometime
beside / and sometime in ye uttermost spo^dyles of ye rydgbone and it makes
Squinansie / that is with a bult before / somtymes is the dysme^brynge in the
vndermoost part / or spondyles / somtymes in that myddyl / than makes a bult
on ye bake / the token of ye dysme^brynge shall be known by the sight / and by
the feeling It is said that all this dysme^brynge of the spondyles / or
backbone / is sore peryllous and ill to set in again for the synewes / and the
back mary / or nucha / and most as the dyslocacie is inward / for it may not
be ha^deleth / the dyslocacie of ye vppermoost spo^dyles that does harm to
swellowe in the meet and drink / the myddellest does harm to the brethe /
the vndermoost does harm to the draught going / and all times ye dyslocacie
is dredefull in what place she is / the first spo^dyles of the neck is sore
bound with synewes / on the bones of ye heed / and therefore it is great peril /
and between the last bone of the neck / yt is the. vii. and the. viij.
spo^dyles / and it is the first there the rybbes have his beginning / by twene
them it is great peril for ye meuyng of the neck / and therefore in the same.
ii. places of the spondyles or back bone thercometh sonner ye dyslocacye than
in any other / and his dyslocacye is sore peril. The dyslocacye that is in the
vppermoost spondyles that is cuttyng of ye neck / that causes ye death
hastily of a man for cause that ye inthrestynge bone stops the wind / and
takes away his life / as this dyslocacye is between ye. vij. and. viij
spondyles / than is the way stops of the meet and drynk / and the way of the
air is thouched / and as the dyslocacye is under ye viij. spondyle / than
leseth the nether most members his meuynge / for the stoppynge / and hurtynge
of the synnewes and nucha / whereof comes all time the meuynge and feeling /
Therefore it is needful shortly it tobe setin again / and as the bone in ye
neck is out of the joint / than hangs the heed forward / or behyndeward /
and the pacye^t cannot speak / and them shall you help thus Je shall have a
servant to hold the^ pacye^t with one hand under the chyne / and the other
hand on the heed / and let him hold fast / than set your hand on ye pacyent
on his neck and command the servant that he the heed hold up ward / and
ye shall with your hand threst downward unto ye time till ye have set in again
the bones of the pacyent / is ye first spo^dyle out the ioynte / and is it not
shortly set in again tha^ shall he dye / And in this manner following shall it be
set in again (as Albuca. Haly abbas / Auicenna / and Lancfrankcus says) that
heed shall wise pulls with ye hands / and with one (...) bind / and lay him
a small styke in the mouth and threst him upward by the chyne / or with the here /
up by the eerys / and the shulder shall be threst downward with the feet / and
he shall be pulls in both places with good provision / with cords or other
instrumetes when the. vii. back bone or spendyle is out ye joint of ye. viij.
spo^dile tha^ tarry not long of ye insettynge / and gothe ye dyslocacye inward
/ than kylleth the parsone shortly / and he is seldom helped / nevertheless
begyne the cure / and threst him the shulder down. ward / and pull the neck as
is a fore said / Is ye dyslocacie outward / that seldom happeth / that may be
helped with ye hand strongely to threst downward as ye best can / and with
stretchynge of the neck / and with neder threstynge the shulder downewarde.

Is the dismembrynge benethe the. viij. spondyle and y^ it gothe sore inward
than it is deedly / and it shall never be hol^e^ / and is it not hole ^ward /
but that it alonely threst the ^ucha / than the nethermost members lyseth his
meuynge. As the dislocacie is inward / than there byded at every time a bulte
how well it be cures / nevertheless theris a cure of the spondyles / whereof
grows a cro^ed back / and that shall be threstin with youcha^de in ye best
manner as it can be done or with a board that thereto is made. Wha^ye have ho^pe^
them / than bind there upon this pla^ter here after following.

A Plaster.
Take Dyle o^ roses. iij. ou^s. Mumie Ma^tick Bolyarmen^ / Dragantum Myrt^llo
ruin / Go^mi arabici / ofeche. ii. ou^c. mydle it to gyder with the white of
eggs in the manner that it be thynne / and depeth therein clothes and they lay
there upon / and there over lay. ii. splentes made with towe and depte in the
^ame. than bind him softely. There (...) ^ethym blood on the hand / and make
him going to the draught. and he shall ete (...) made with eggs and with
crommes of (...) de depte in barley water. And he shall dr^^ke water wherein is
sodde^ Cheryses or bac. y. And dress him at every. v. days (...) / the
pacient shall be laid upward that the ^morynge may be threst down. And the time
of his helynge is. xx. days.

Of the dyslocacyon of therybbes. Ca. lxxx.
^S the rybbes be out the joint / than right it and set it in with the hand
and lay there over ye aforesaid plaster dep^e in (...) white of eg. and wrynge
it out again / but it shall first be dept in water and wrynge it out. therouer
bind. ii. splentes not to last / So bind him. ix. days long. and all times
lay thereon the defensiuu^. and rule him (...) meet and drink as is aforsayd.
If in this place comany oneuen knoddes / tha^ salve him every day (...) the
salve made of Oil. xii. ou^c. Wax / Fenigrekemeele of ech^. ii. ou^. Rosyll.
vi. ou^. Butter. iiij. ou^. Fra^kensens Bdellij / of each an ou^e. Duckes grese
/ K^pons grese / of each an ou^c. mydle this together on the fire and salve the
place therewith And ye shall know that this Salve takyth away ye knoddys of the
members / and makes even / and set the bo^ys right.

Of the dyslocacie of the bonys of the shulders. Ca. lxxxi.
THis bone comes not hole out ye joint / but that bone de^a^teth somewhat out
his place (...) than shall ye help ye bone (...) your hand and there over ye
a^orsayde plaster / And lay there ou^^ small (...) shyns of five to we / and
thereafter splentes and every day the desen (...) him blood and going to the
drawght and rule him u^ mete and drink as is aforsayd. Is there a wound sow
them / and lay thereon this powder of Mastick Drago^s blood / Gomi arabici /
Dragantu^ / of each. ii. ou^^. Thereafter cleanse the wound (...) this plaster.
ix. days long. Take^ose honey. xii. ou^c. (...) meel / or barley meel / or
mylst^^ meele. iii^. ou^c. fra^kensence / aloes / of each an ou^c. and as the
wound is clensyd / tha^ hele it (...) the ^am^ powder. or with the gren^
wounded plaster. or (...) both. And his mete and drink shall be as I have
said oftentimes before.

Of the dysmenbrynge of the shulders. Ca. lxxxij
AUice^na set alone. ii. manners in this disme^brynge. Albucasis and other
masters says that there be more in the shulder / for it gothe out ye ^oxce of
ye shulder in. iij. manners. The first / that the heed of ^habone of the
vppermoost arm separteth downward. The other comes forewarde to the first
part. The. iij. in ye mids upward / but backewarde can it not come out the
shulder bone. The first dysme^brynge is be know^ by ye sight and ^elynge as
th^r is feled ye heed of the arm pype vnd the hole of the arm / and upon the
shulder is seen an holnes. The other dysme^brynge is known by the ^inge of
the heed of the arm^^ype before and (...) se an holnes Th^^hyrde is in the
mids vpwart / and is to kn^we^ / as the pacient cannot retche out his ellebow
from his body and vnd ye arm ye se an ^olnes / and on the shu^ an hyghnes.

The manner for to set it in again is this Is i^^chylde (...) a ^ge parson^
and that shulderbone is out of the toynte / than take it (...) your ^este han^
and make a fyste with your right hand / and set it so v^ the holl of the arm
upon ye (...) than lift (...) de with your fyste like if it hang on any
thing / than comes the bone in his right place: The other manner is / as ye
pacient is old and great / and (...) him not list up / than command ^to lie
on his back / and then shall ye (...) round bowl of tree / and wind it about
(...) clothes and lay it under the holl of his a^me on the out coming bone /
than shall ye treed (...) your heel on the round bowl stefly downward / and
take the pacient (...) the hand and p^llestefly downward / than comes the
arm again in his ryghteplace. The. iij. manner is. the pacient shall be pulls
(...) the arm over a staff / in ye mids of the staff a bowl wou^de^ about
(...) clothes / and both the ends of the staf shall be made fast hyer tha^ ye
length of a man. And the pacie^t shall stand upon a stole / than shall ye pull
ye arm over the staf / tha^ shall ye also pusshe ye stole from under his sote
/ so shall the bone be (...) by ye grace of god. The. iiij. manner is wa^ad der
/ in the same manner as you have done (...) ye staf (as Haly abbas / A louca^^^
^. and Brun^ says) But Roger^^ please better that Guydo says (...) the foot /
with ye (...) and with ^he staf / and not with the ladder. The syfte ^aner is
with the instrument as (...) death in picture / and in all manner as (...) by the
same pycture. And the dismembr^ be setin also with retchynge and pulling and
with threstynge in with the hand or (...) a clothe (as Lank^ says) And will
it notbe setin again / for cause that it has the long ben out of the ioynte
/ and is bec^ hard / than shall ye wasshe it with warm water / as is
asoresayd / and make it soft and brenge it in again. And as it is done than
pleases me Rogeri^ / ye which in the first iij. days dresseth the pacie^t
with a (...) (...) clothe and towe depte in whyt or eggs Thereafter with ye
plaster of mylstufm^ele dragons blood. etc. as I have said before. And ye shall
lay under the arm of the pacient a bowl with clothes / or made of towe and
byndehym well fast with a band that is. v. fyngers broad / and as long as it
nedyth.



Of the dysmenbrynge of the elbowe. Ca. lxxxiij.
THis dislocatio^ of ye elbow as (Auicenna says) is somtymes great / and
somtymes small / Albuca. and other masters says yt it gothe somtymes forward
out the joint / and sometime be hynde / The token of this dysmembrynge is
heaviness in ye meuynge / that it is not possible the pacyent to bring the hand
to ye shulder / The elbow comes heuely out ye joint and is heuely to set in
again / for thesene was and daynes. Of the setting in and cure says Auicenna
that it is i^. ii. manners / the first with the any hand hold the shulder /
with ye other hand to drive in it again that is out / with styff detynge behind
on the elbowe / with a salued hand with oil / till it comes in again /
Rogerius says the manner of been dynge / Lanca^r^cancus set the cure thereof with
stretchynge and with vphanggynge / or with berynge or weight / if the
dyslocacio^ gothe forward or behind ward / but Guydo set it in with the knee
as dyslocacie is forward. is dyslocacio^ it afterward or behind so set he it
in the hand (as Auicenna writes) and the manner of the insettynge with the
knee or heel that shall be done in it that is forward Je shall take a broad
longhande about his arm / yt the. ii. end goo behind and let your servant
hold both ye ends in every hand one / and the pacyent shall be bound on his
foot / and shall be holde^ / and command the pacyent to stretche out his arm
/ tha^ command the servant with the hand to pull backwarde / than shall the
master hastily the arm set foremarde to senn the shulder again. Tha^ threst
in with the knee that there stand outward / brenge the arm to the shulder. As
it is out behind / tha^ is good ye arm to be bowed / and ouertwart by a
little lift up the arm / and turn it somewhat (as Ja merices says) In ye
fastmakinge of this cur^ follow all things as I have learned in the aforesaid
chaptre / but the arm shall be berynge about the neck / and by little and lytyl
shall he be bound higher / till the hand come to the shulder / and every.
iiii. day shall it be dresseth onys. And at every time shall be bowen the
membre. And it is wou^te to be heled in. xv. days.

Of the dysmenbrynge of the hand or knot of the wrest. Ca. lxxxiiij.
THe bone of ye hand goth lightly out of the joint / and is lightly to setin
again / as it be (...) quykly. And as it bydeth^ time out of the ioynte / than
com thereto sometime an ipostumacion / and than it is with great pain and heaviness
to set it in again. And this disme^brynge is most before or behind. and the
cure thereof shall be done with stretching / pulling / and meuyng and with
downward thressynge. But I take the lift hand of the pacie^t in my hand
stetly by the knot / and take his myddell finger in my right hand. stretchynge
and pulling the same finger / and in the pulling threst I on the outcomyng
theragaynst / with the finger under / or with the thombe above / and so it will
lyghtely be setin. In the fast making is none other cure tha^ I have learned
you And Jamerices heled this in. xii. days. Is there a wound / than bind him
yt the wound may besene en every day.

Of the dysmenbynge of the fyngers. Ca. lxxxv.
THe dismembrynge of the fyngers that comes lightly and is lightly set in / if
he be brusyd than help him thus stretche ye finger as I have learned in the
next chapter / and lay thereon this plaster following.

A plaster.
Take been meell / orote meell. xii. ounces / mastyck / dragantum / gum of
Arabie of each an ounce / make thereof a soft plaster with the white of eggs /
and lay it thereon and bind it there about / and let it be bound unto ye.
iiij. day / and bind him again till he be hole.

Of the dsymenbrynge of the bonys of the hyppys. Ca. lxxxvi.
A^ice^. says as this dysmembrynge of ye hyppes is inward and forward / than
the leg is longer than otherwise / and the pacyent steppeth up the hole fete
/ and he may not bow forward / that heed of ye thyghe is gone inward in the
lyske / and in ye vterpt is holownes In ye dysme^bryng afterward and outward
causes the leg be ye short / and the pacient may not set his heel on the
ground / The cure thereof lerneth Albucasis / and is sore profitable to all
manners and ye shall the syke fast hold by ye shulders or he shall be bound
over the shulders on ye thyghe / with a band on a wyndas / and the other band a
bow ye knee on the same wyndas / than pull the membre out with the wind / and
with the hand right it till it be set in / The first dysmembrynge wyche is
inward and before shall the pacyent be puleth / and with the foot or knee
drive it in again As the dysmembryng is outward and behind / so shall ye
pacyent in like wise be pull that the heyth with ye kne be threst inward and the
holnes may come out / and for this dysmembrynge lightly to set in again / so
must ye have a table longer than the pacye^t and make on every end a wind /
and in the mids under the back and on ye belly shall the pacyent be bound on
the wind with a long towell / and with an other shall be bound on the knee / and
wind about ye hoole pype with the towell unto the foot / and shall be bound so
on the other wind and than shall ye wind with both the wyndas to gyder and
set that bone of the pacyent in again / and than the byndynge of this shall be
like as it stand before in that chapter of dysme^brynge from the uppermost
arm of the adiutorium / but it shall be bound faster.

Of the dysmenbrynge of the knee shynes. Ca. lxxxvij.
AS these dysmembrynge is done / than shall ye command the pacy^ to stand up
on both his feetes / and hold him his place / and thereafter bind it with a
plaster of sycer meele of been meele like as I have learned you / and dress
him all. iiij. days onys / Is there a wound so do as I have before learned you

swerynge away through the draught going and through the vryne. And if it goth
so away / than sees barley in water and do therein a little honey and give it
the pacient to drink / than shall the place inwardely be clensyth.

How the co^sumynge me^bres ought to be helped and cured. Ca. xcii.
WIth a woollen clothe and with water of the styngynge nettylles shall ye first
(...) be ye membre or ioynte. (...). or. iiij. days / and every day ii. or.
iij. times. The second ye shall set ventoses or boxes about the sore / and

in. i^^. days onys a fresshe plaster again.

Another proved experiment to the same.
Bind about that membre there it is consumed a roope of here / and let it lie
thereon as long as he may suffer it. that do at the le^ iij. or. iiij. times
in. iij. days. And afterward set him in a bathe stewe / and set over ^ll

shall sit under the said kettell / and he shall lay that consumyng member in a
basen / or in a payl / or in an other vessel / so as ye place be not wet there
he shall sit / and the crane shall be turned that it may drope a little out

medesyn stops sone the blood / and co^sumeth it hastily as the pacient
takes meet which stops.

How you shall helpen him that is fallen or betyn / and if his blood be run /
or engeled like cruddys / and the flesh brusyd. Ca. xcv.
HEre shall ye learn to defend and to make last the place yt is hurt / that
there come no ipostume / nor swellyng / nor other evil accident. The first. as
one is fallen from an high place / or sore beten / yt he has lost his spece /
or yt he has his spece but speaks folyshly / than is in doughte that ye
brain and the members of the heed be perysshyd.

And Auicenna says the wit of understanding showyth the helte of the brain
/ yet it is needly to search / if he be deed or alive / which ye shall know by
feeling the pulse / calling him / and pullyng him by the eeres / and take fine
towe / or kemyd wolle / and hold it at his mouth / and before his nose holys
and so shall ye see if the wind come out or not / and if ye see one good token
yt the breest steryth any thing / than make him to nese with peper / and
euforbio / and rub his members with vynegre / and with herb a grace and make
him blede with the nesynge / and as he is come by one manner to him self / tha^
let him blood / and glyster him as I have le^^ed you. If the pacient be hurt
in the brain / than follow ye learning of the brusyng / or contusion of the
heed / but if ye hole body be brusyd or hurt / than anoynte all ye hurt place
with oil of roses / or with oil myrtyllorum / and straw therouer ye powder
of myrtyll / as is a fore said of the wou^des with the brusynge / Some lays
such a pacie^t in warm horse dounhe / and lets him therein sweet / and yt
helps him / but Haliabbas / and Auicenna byndeth him in a shepes skin that
is fresh and warm / yt is ^leene anon / and straw yt with a little beten or
stampte salt / and let him lie therein a hole day / and the other day he
shall be hole. In the out pulling of the blood the work masters has wrought
after ye counsel of Hali abbas / and the place shall be made strounge with a
clothe depte in cold water and lay thereon / but I was wounte to do in that
water much salt and wta blew wolle cloth / that I first and often laid on yt
membre / for it consumyth the engelyd blood / and makes the place fast / and
as he is strong than make the body to sweet with hot gere

And if it help not / tha^ consume it in this manner hereafter wryte^ / it
softeth the pain of the engeled blood / and opens ye swetynge holes.
