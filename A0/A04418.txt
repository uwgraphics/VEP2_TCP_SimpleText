Christ's Tears over Jerusalem.
OR, A Caveat for England, to call to GOD for Mercy, lest we be plagued for our
contempt and wickedn^sse.
To the tune of The Merchant.


When Christ our Lord drew nigh Jerusalem,
Foreseeing all the miseries
the which should fall on them:
And casting of his looks,
upon that beauteous Town,
For very grief the bitter tears
from his fair eyes fell d^wne.
Repent fair England now,
repent while thou have space,
And do not like Jerusalem
despise Gods proffred grace.
Alas Jerusalem,
Jerusalem (quoth he)
Which killed the Prophets of the Lord,
when they were sent to thee:
How often times would I
have kept thee from all ill
Even as the Hen her Chickens keeps,
but thou were stubborn still?
Oh that thou had but known,
at least in that thy day,
The things which did concern thy peace,
but now it is hid away:
Yea from thine eyes it is hid,
thou shall not see the same,
And for thy sorrows coming on,
thy self do only blame.
Therefore the days shall come,
thy enemies shall rise,
And trench thee in on every side,
regarding not thy cries:
Thy strong and stately Towers,
in wrath they shall confound,
And make thy sumptuous buildings all,
lie equal with the ground.
And such shall be their rage,
they shall not leave in thee
One stone upon another stone,
which shall not spoiled be:
Because thou knew not
the seasonable day,
Wherein the Lord did visit thee,
to wash thy sins away.
Thus Christ without the Town
did weep for their distress,
While they within triumph in sin,
and use all wickedness;
No whit they would believe
the words that he did say,
But enviously did practice still
to take his life away.
He mourned and wept full sore,
to think upon their smart,
While they full stout did go about
to pierce his tender heart;
And for his pains they stripped him,
and whipped him through the Town,
And with a wreath of pricking thorns,
his holy head did crown.
They scoft and laughed at him,
they dashed him on the face:
They called him gracious Lord and King
in flowting and disgrace:
And through his hands and feet
they nailed him to the Cross,
Between two lewd and wicked thieves;
but few lament his loss.
They gave him for to drink,
sharp vinegar and gall,
And with a Spear they pierced his side,
till his heart blood did fall:
Yet patiently and mild,
he suffered every thing,
And prayed his Father not to charge
them with this grievous sin.
The second part,
To the same tune.


When thus they had dispatched
the living Lord of life,
Full safely then they thought themselves
from sorrow, care and strife:
But within few years space,
as Christ before had told;
The mighty Emperor of Rome,
came there with courage bold.
And with a mighty host,
he did besiege them round,
By Sword and Famine ere he went,
he did them quite confound:
Yea, Dogs and Cats they ate,
Mice, Rats and every thing:
For want of food, their Infants young,
unto the Pot they bring.
No pity could they find,
at this their enemies hand,
But Fire, Sword, and cruel death,
before them still did stand:
Their famous City fair,
he set upon a flame.
And burnt their Temple unto dust,
that stood within the same.
And those that escaped the Sword,
and fury of his hand,
He made them slaves and bondmen all
within a foreign Land.
Thus fair Jerusalem,
was cast unto the ground,
For their great sin and wickedness
the Lord did it confound.
Awake, England, I say,
rise from the sleep of sin,
Cast off the great security,
which thou have lived in:
Thy God has often called,
and offered thee his grace,
His messengers have shown his will
to thee in every place.
Great wonders has he shown,
to thee by Sea and Land,
And sent strange tokens in the air,
to make thee understand:
He is offended sore
at thy great wickedness,
And that except thou do repent,
thy plagues shall he express.
Remember how of late
the Spaniard thee assayld,
And how of Gods especial power
they never a whit prevailed:
And all was for to try
if thou would sin forsake,
And to an upright holy life,
thy self at last betake.
But soon have thou forgot
his favor in the same,
Which afterward most grievously
his wrath did so inflame,
That then he plagued thee
with pestilence and death,
Whereby in Country and in Town
a number lost their breath.
Yet will thou not forsake
thy wickedness and ill,
But in thy pride and covetousness,
thou do continue still.
Provoke not God to wrath,
with thy most loathsome sin,
But speedily t'amend thy life,
by prayers now begin.
And therefore now England,
at last for mercy cry,
And grieve the Lord thy God no more,
through thine iniquity,
Lest he forsake thee quite,
and turn away his face,
Because like to Jerusalem,
thou do despise his grace.
Repent therefore O England,
repent while thou have space,
And do not like Jerusalem,
despise Gods proffered grace.
FINIS.
