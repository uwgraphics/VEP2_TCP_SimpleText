reform this error, the Spirit of God in the Word has directed us the right

unavoidable employments, will not suffer me to perform answerably to mine own
desire, and mine Honorable Lords and your Ladyships desert. And so wishing
again and again unto your Ladyship, (for what other, or what better thing can
I wish?) that which the work it self imports, true Contentment from God in
this life, and full Contentment with God after this life; I take my leave for
the present, but cease not to continue

TRVE CONTENTMENT.
1. TIMOTH. 6. 6. Godliness is great Gain, with Selfe-sufficiencie; or, with
the Sufficiency of it self.
THE FORMER PART. The Gain of Godliness.
THe Stoic Philosophy, which Act. 17. 18.
Luke the Evangelist makes mention of, Lege Cicer. parad. and Lipsij ^^^nud^ct.
was famous for Paradoxes, strange Opinions, improbable, and besides common
conceit, Seneca passion, and Arrian. in dissert. and alij.
admired much for them by some, Plu^. in Stoic. contradict. and quod Poet^
Stoicis probabiliora la^^antur.
controlled and taxed for them by others. Howbeit not Stoicisme only, but
every art and profession, every course of life and learning has some Paradoxes
or other; the world not a few, and* In hic creber est Chrysostomus: quod
notavit Six^us Sen: biblioth: l. 4.
Christianity many more, as strange, yea stranger, than any that the Stoics
ever held, and yet (...) Agatho. (...). Aristot. rhetor. l. 2. c. 26.
Verissimaque sunt non pauca, quae tamen sunt minime verisimilia.
no less true than strange.

A worldly Paradox the Apostle had mentioned in the verse next before going, to
wit, that some men should hold Gain to be Godliness: unto which he opposes a
contrary Christian Paradox in the words of my Text, to wit, that Godliness is
the only true Gain.

For the former: It is a very absurd conceit indeed, and though too too rife in
the world, yet such as few or none will be acknowne of, and either openly
father, or seem outwardly to favor. But as God at the last day, when the
wicked shall go about to excuse and defend themselves, he will not only take
hold of their words, Ex ore tuo indicab^ te, serve nequa^. Math. 25. 26. Luk 19
22.
By thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou thriftles servant; and advantage
of their actions, Math. 25. 42, 43.
I was naked and ye clad me not, hungry and ye fed me not, etc. and theresore
had neither Faith nor Love; but he will convince them by their own Consciences
too, Romans 2. 15.
Their secret thoughts shall either excuse or accuse them in that day: In like
manner must we deal with those that will seem to abhor and detest this
Opinion, and yet do those things that maintain and uphold it.

Psalm. 14. 1. and 53. 1.
^he ^oole says i^ (...) heart, There is no God; and that is sufficient to
prove him an Athe^^ though he never openly maintain any Position of Atheism.
And there be some that Tit. 1. 16.
profess they know God, but deny him in their deeds: and Quiescat lingua,
loqua^^^ vita. Aug. in 1. Joan. hom. 3. (...). E^s^h. prepar E^a g. l. 1. c. 1.
Efficacius est vita testimonium qua^ lingue* Cypria^. do dupl martyr* Et (...)
v^^ ^peris quam ^^^. ^ern. in C^nt.
that is enough to prove them irreligious, though they never utter that their
impiety in speech. So in this case, the Covetous man's heart says it, and his
practice proclaims it, that Diuites facultatibus suis alligates mag^^ aurum
consueuisse suspic^re quam coelu^. Minut. Octav. Quid f^cisti quod iussit Deus?

summo Jovi, Atque in manibus exta teneam vt porriciam, interea loci. Si lucr^
quid detur, potius r^m diuina^ desera^. Plaut. Pseud. 1. 3.
his Gold is his God, and that his Gain is his Godliness; and that is
sufficient to prove him an Idolater, though he never outwardly bow his knee to
an Idol. In regard whereof, the Apostle expressly pronounces Coloss. 3. 5.
Covetousness to be Idolatry, and the Ephesians. 5. 5. Lege Chrysostom ad Ephesians. ho^. 18
Covetous man an Idolater.

To reason then in this point, as our Savior himself does: Vbi thesaurus, ibi
and cor. Math. 6 21. Nemo enim potest nisi cogitare de thesauro suo, and quoda^
cordis itinere diuitias suas sequi. Aug. de diverse. 44.
Where a man's Treasure is, their is his Heart; and where a man's heart is,
there is his happiness; and where his happiness is, that is his God. Since
the covetous man therefore Psalm. 62. 12.
sets his heart on his riches; Psalm 49 6. Job. 31. 24.
puts his trust in his treasure: and whereas Pro. 18. 10. (...). Basil. in
Psalm. 45.
the faithful make the name of God their strong tower, whereunto they resort
in time of trouble for safety, Pro. 18. 11.
the worldly rich man makes his wealth his bulwark and fence, whereupon he
reposeth himself and wholly relyeth: It must of necessity follow hereupon,
that as the Apostle says of the fleshly-minded man, that Phil. 3. 19. Romans 16.
18. Clem. p^dag. l. 2. c. 1. (...). ventre^ colu^t, que^ pro Deo habent. Cypr.

Hieron. in Ephesians.
his money, or his penny is his God: And if his Money be his God; his Gain
must needs be his Godliness.

But the Apostle here tells us a quite contrary tale, and learneth us here a
flat opposite lesson; that, howsoever worldly men may think that Gain is
Godliness; yet in deed and truth it is not so; but Godliness rather is Gain,
and great Gain.

So that the Apostle does (...), propositionem invertere; he turns the
proposition clean backward, and brings it about, as it were. Gain is
Godliness, says the worldly man. Nay, Godliness is Gain, and great Gain,
says the Apostle, and the Spirit of God by him.

But this peradventure will seem a Paradox as strange as the former. As very
few that will outwardly avow the former; so as few are there that are inwardly
persuaded of the latter. It seems a Paradox with the most.

For, Godliness great Gain? may some man say. The contrary rather seems
undoubted and undeniable, to wit, that Isto t^ pauperes, cum nimis sancte pius.
Plaut. Rude^t. 4. 7. Varro, regustatum digito terebrare sal^num contentus
perages, si vi^ere cum love te^di^ P^rs. sat. 5.
Godliness is a great enemy to Gain. Balaam lost great wealth and honor,
because he would not disobey the word of God: Number. 24 11.
I had thought, says Balak, to have advanced thee, and made thee a great man;
but thy God has kept thee from honor. Michah might have bin a great man in
Ahabs books, and very richly and royally reward^d by him, if he would have
spoken but two words only, as some other did; if he would but have said, (...)
Ascend in pace. 1 King. 22. 12, 13.
Go up in peace. But his Godliness hindered his Gain; and not so only, but
was a mean to bring him into much trouble. So that it may seem, that
Godliness is altogether gainelesse, and Ungodliness the more gainefull of the
two.

For the Nehem. 13. 16.
Merchants of Tire and Zidon for lucre and gain strain courtesy with Gods
commandment, to utter their fish and wares on the Sabbath. And no doubt of it,
Facile^ esse cui^ ad diuitias viam, quo die bon^ mentis poenituerit. Demetrius
apud Senecam nature. quest. l. 4. pr^fat.
Gods children, if they would not be so strict and strait laced; if they would
not stand upon nice points and terms; if they would not stick to lie and
dissemble with Act. 5. 1, 2.
Ananias and Sapphira; to belie and beguile, as Ziba, Mephibosheths man did his
Master; to swear and forswear, y 1 Samuel 16. 1, 2.
with 1 Macc. 1. 61, 62.
profane Antiochus; to steal and purloine with young Judge. 17. 2.
Micah of Mount Ephraim; to oppress and murder, when they have ius in
manibus, the law in their own hands, with 1 King. 21.
wicked Ahab, and cursed Iezabel; they might as well come to wealth, as many
worldly men do, that scrape and gather much goods together by these means. But
they may well say, as the Psalmist says, Psalm. 67. 7. Eu^ qui sit iustus ac
bonus, stultum esse. Carneades apud Ci^. de repub. l. 3. Vise Lactant.
institut. l. 5. c. 12. 14.
For thy sake, O Lord, are we counted fools; because we stand so much upon
matter of conscience.

1 Cor. 9. 15. 23.
Holy Paul says he might have done this and that, but he would not, because he
would not make the Gospel evil spoken of. And the keeping of a man's word
turns oft-times to his loss. The Psalm. 15. 4.
godly man swears and fails not, though it be to to his own hindrance:
that which a worldly man will not willingly do. So that it may seem then that
Godliness is rather a great enemy to Gain, and Ungodliness a great deal
the more gainful.

But those that define Loss and Gain on this wise, do not try them by the
right touchstone, do not weigh them out in the Balance of the Sanctuary, at
the Beam of Gods word: and therefore no marvel, if they take the L^k. 16 11.
Diuitie nec vere nec vestr^. Aug. de verb. Dom. 35. and de diuersis. and Bern.
de bon. deser.
false Riches for the true Treasure.

For Genes. 2. 19.
man indeed had authority given him to name the Creatures, and he has named
worldly Wealth, Gain: But God that is above man, and that gave man this
authority, he has named Godliness, Gain, and not Wealth. As the Apostle
therefore says, 2 Pet. 3. 9.
God is not slack, as men count slacknes: so Godliness is not Gain as men
count Gain, but as God counts Gain. For 1 Samuel 16. 7.
man sees not as God sees; Esai. 55. ^.
nor thinks as God thinks. But as Luke 16. 15.
those things that are precious in man's eyes, are abominable in Gods sight: so
1 Cor. 1. 28. Psalm. 51. 17.
those things that are contemptible in the eyes of man, are 1 Pet. 3. 4.
of high account many times in the sight of God. And every thing is, not as man
valueth it, but as God esteems it; not as man reckneth it, who is Psalm. 62 9.
and 39. 5.
vanity it self, and therefore may easily be deceived, yea Galat. 6. 3. Jam.
1. 26.
oft-times deceives himself; but as God rateth it, Tit. 1. 2. Si v^lunt
in^enire, quod (...) non potest, habent prorsus, ^entiri non potest. Aug. de
ci^it. l. 22. ^. 25. Potenter hoc non potest. Idem de Trinit. l. 15. c. 14.
Magna potentia mentiri non posse. Ibid. 15.
who neither does deceive any, Galat. 6. 7.
nor can by any be deceived, being Job. 14. 6.
Verity and truth it self.

Either then we must say as God says, or we must say as the World says.
Either we must say, that Godliness is no Gain, or else we must say, that
Gain is no Gain, when Godliness and Gain shall stand forth together, either
in way of comparison the one with the other, or in way of opposition the one
unto the other.

Now, when Godliness and Gain shall in this manner contend, that Godliness
ought to have the day of it, will evidently appear, if it may be showed unto
us:

First, that Godliness is Gain rather than Gain: and

Secondly, wherein this Gain of Godliness does consist.

For the former, to wit, that Godliness is rather to be accounted Gain, than
Gain, may be proved to us by these three Arguments.

First, Godliness may do a man good without gain, but worldly gain can do a
man no good without godliness. As the Heathen Orator says of bodily might,
that (...). Isocr. ad Demonic.
strength of body joined with discretion and wisdom, may do a man much good;
but without it, it is but (...). Plut. de muliebri disciplina apud Stob. to^.
2. c. 90.
as a sword in a child, or in a mad man's hand, rather a means to mischief a
man's self than otherwise: as we see an example in Milo Crotoniates, the
strongest man of his time, - viribus ille co^^^sus perij^, admirandisque
lacertis. Iuvenal. sat. 10. Legatur Gellius l. 15. c. 16. and Val. Max. l. 9.
c. 12. Qui concludit, Nimio robore memb^o^u^ ^igorem mentis hebescere, quasi
abnu^nte natura vtriusque boni largitione^, ne supra mortalem sit foelicitate^,
eundem and valentissimum esse and sapientiss^mum.
who unwarily assaying, on trust of his strength, to riue a piece of timber
with his hands, which some others with wedge and beetle could not cleave, was
caught fast by the fists, and so devoured by Wolves. So Riches joined with
godliness and good Conscience, are the Omnia ista bon^ sunt, sed vnde^acias
be^e, non quae te faciant bonu^. Aug. de temp. 238.

of good to our selves, and of doing good unto others: but being severed from
godliness and the true fear of God, are rather (...). Euripid. Ple^sthen.

an instrument of vice, than any furtherance to virtue, a mean to make as our
sins the greater here, so our condemnation accordingly the more grievous
hereafter.

So that as the Heathen man says, that Damnu^ non lucrum est cum mala fama
lucru^. P. Sir.
Gain gotten by loss or hazard of a man's good name, is no gain but loss;
because a man loses therein more then all his gettings can counteruaile:
since that Prou. 22. 1. (...) Isocr. ad Dem^. (...). Mena^d.
A good name is (as Solomon says) above riches and treasure; of greater worth
than any wealth. So Gain gotten with the breach or hazard of a good

he may miss of his purpose therein too, can make amends for it, if it
miscarry, be that he get and gain never so much. And for a man to get and
gain never so much one way, if by the compassing of it he loose far more an
other way, it is in truth no Gain at all.

For this cause as the Apostle asks the Question; Romans 6. 21.
Quid profuit? What profit had ye then of those things, whereof you are now
ashamed? nay, Si secundu^ merita tibi daret, da^naret te. Aug. in Psalm. 102.
for which now you should be damned, if you had your desert; for the end of
such things is death: And the damned Spirits demand of themselves; Wisdom. 5. 8.
Quid prodest? What profit have we now of all our profits and pleasures, that
we enjoyed in the world, when we are hurled headlong into hell? So our Savior
himself asks, Matthew. 16. 26.
Quid proderit? What will it profit a man to win the whole world, Luk 9. 35.
and destroy himself, Mark 8. 36, 37.

For a man handsomely to refuse money, and forgo gain, it is no small gain
sometime. So for a man in some case to forgo his gain, to refuse gold, to
neglect his own good, though Quis nisi mentis in^ps oblatum respuat aurum?
so to do may seem ^olly, when Game and Godliness will not agree together,
when Aug. de te^p. 215.
lucrum in arca facit damnum in conscientia, and Ambros. in Psalm. 218. ser. 5.
lucrum pecuniae dispendium ^it animae; when profit in a man's purse would
procure a broach in his Conscience, and the gain of gold prove the break-neck
of his soul; (...) Georg. Pr^id. de vanitat. vita.
such refusal of gain is the greatest Gain that can be. For says an ancient
Father well, Quan^u^libe^ magna amittere, vt m^iora acquiras, no^ est damnum
sed negotiatio. Bern. de bon des.
To let go, though never so great a matter, for the compassing of a greater,
is no loosing bargain, but a gainefull negotiation. To which purpose the
Apostle Paul having related, what a great man he might have bin among his own
People, had he held on in Iudaisme as he began; he concludes at length, that
he deemed all Philip. 3. 7, 8, 9.
that, and all else, but as (...).

Admire not the man that is risen sodninely to great riches and honor, says
the Psalmist. No? why, who would not admire one that lives in such state and
pomp as Nihil est insolentius noviti diuite. Sen. lib. 2. controv. 1.
such are usually wont to do? Vides viu^ntem: c^gita mori^^tem. quid hic

Yea but, when he dies, he shall carry none of that his wealth away with him;

As he came naked, so shall he go naked again, and leave all that by his care
and indusirie he had raked together and heaped up, behind him; and in all
respects go even as he came.

It is with us in this world, as it was in the Jewish fields and vineyards;
Deuteronomy. 23. 24, 25.
pluck and eat they might what they would, while they were there, but they
might not pocket or put up ought to carry away with them: Or Mund' iste

Al^o^. Carpent. destruct. vit: p. 4. ^. ^.
as with boys, that having gotten by stealth into an Orchard, stuff their
sleeves and their pockets full with apples and pears, well hoping to get out
with them, but when they come to the door, they find one there that searches
them, and takes all their fruit away from them, and so sends them away with
no more than they brought in: Or Guil. Paris. and Alex. Carp. ibid.
as poor men, that invited to a rich man's board, have the use of his plate to
drink^ in, and silver spoones to eat with while they are there; but if any of
them presume to put up a piece of plate or a spoone, there is search made by
the Porter, ere they are let out, for what is miss^ng among them, and so are
they turned out again as they came in: In like manner is it with us in regard
of these temporal blessings; we have free liberty to use them as we will
while we are here; but when we are to go hence, Mors mund^ ^^sor; qui oues

there is one waiting on us, that will be sure to strip us, and suffer nothing

us, Non magis h^c ad defunctum pertinent hominem, quam secundae ad editum

that which yet we shall have no sense of, nor be any whit at all the better
for, than if we were wholly without it.

But Godliness, and the gain of it, will abide by us for ever. Sicut charitas

the reward of it, that is the gain that comes by it, endures for ever, and
extends it self to all eternity, lasting not only past this lives end, but
past the whole worlds end, with which all worldly wealth and gain; must needs
have an end.

This world is compared to a Fishing; the (...) 1^. ^7.
end of it, to the drawing up of the nets: while the nets are down, there is
nothing said to be caught; for the nets may break, and the Fish escape. But at
the end of the world, when the nets are drawn up, it will then evidently
appear what each man has caught. And then those that have fished here for
riches and gain, may say with Peter, Luke 5. 7.
Domine, tota hac nocte laboravimus, and nihil cepimus: Lord, all this night
have we labored, and caught nothing at all. For Praesentia amantes
praesentibus indormiunt, thesaur^s somniant, tantisper divites, quamdiu non
vigilent: vbi transijt delectabilis s^mnus iste, nihil in manibus suis
inv^niunt. Aug in Ps. 76. 5.
the worldly rich, when they awake out of their present sleep, wherein they
dream of gold and gain, shall find nothing in their hands. But those that
have here fished for Godliness, may say, as Luke 5. 7, 8.
he might afterward have said; Domine, in verbo tuo retia demisimus, and
cepimus: Lord, at thy word, have we let down our nets, and have caught, yea we
have caught abundantly: we have fished for Godliness, and have gotten Life
eternal. For Romans 2. 7.
Unto those that by patience and perseverance in well doing have sought for
glory and honor and immortality, will the Lord give eternal life in that day.

But let us sift out, and see somewhat more particularly, wherein this
spiritual Gain consists.

First then, the special Wealth in this World, is that which comes by
Inheritance. Prove. 19. 14.
Riches and possessions, land and living, says Solomon, come from a man's
ancestors. And among those things that may make a man happy, the Heathen man
puts this in the first place, as the chief, Res non parta labor, sed
relicta. Martial. l. 10. epig. 47.
Wealth and goods, not earned with ones hands, but left a man by his friends.

But as Virtus no^ est h^redit^^ia* sed nec pieta^. Philosophia non est res
benefici^^ia. Senec. ep. 90.
Virtue, so Piety is not haereditarie. The one comes not by kind; neither
is the other left by will: It is a greater legacy, than the mightiest Monarch
that is, can bequeath to his heir. For Psalm. 16. 5.
God himself is the inheritance of those that have it.

Psalm. 111. 5.
God (says the Psalmist) has given a portion to them that fear him. If a
Rich man give one a Childs part, it is like to be a matter of some worth: Much
more then if God give a man a Childs part. But more then that, Psalm. 142 5.
he himself is the portion that he gives unto his. Psalm. 119 57.
Portio mea ipse es, Domine; says David; O Lord, thou art my portion. And, Qui
dedit me mihi, d dit and se mihi. ^^rn in Psalm. 90.
He that bestowed my self upon me, has bestowed himself also upon me, says
Bernard. And if Deuteronomy. 10. 9. and 18. 2.
the Levites need have no inheritance among their brethren, because God is
their portion; (it is sufficient, they have him, that is, (...) G nes. 17. ^^.
El shaddai, God all sufficient;) and yet that was but in a temporal manner:
Much more then is the godly man wealthy enough, though he have nothing in the
world, though he have no part among worldly men; seeing God is his portion in a
spiritual manner, in a much better sort. He whose portion God is, cannot be
poor.

We use to say, that, He cannot lightly want money, that is Master of the Mint:
and he can never be poor, Qui (...), vt est in Prouerbio; and, cum Plauti
Misite, Auri mon^es, no^ massas, habet.
that has a wellspring of wealth. Psalm. 34. 9. and 84. 11. Beatus home, cuius
est Dominus spes eius, cui nihil deficit, quia Christus ei sufficit. Petrus
Bles. epist. 102 Quantumlibet sis auarus, sufficit tibi Deus. Etenim vult
avaritia terra^ possidere totam, add and coelum; plus est qui fecit terram and
coelum. Aug, in Ps. 55. Deum habens, omnia habes. Aug. de temp. 146. Quid tibi
sufficit, si Deus non sufficit. Idem ad fratr. in crum. 51. 2 Cor. 6. 10.
Much less then can that man want ought that is good, who is possessed of God
himself, Iam. 1. 17. Omne enim bonu^ aut ipse est, aut ab ipse. Aug. de doct.
Cor. l. 1. c. 31. ^6. 11. 36.
the fountain of all good. In regard whereof, David having prayed for many
temporal blessings in the behalf of his people, Ps. 144. 12, 13, 14.
that their Sons might be ^all and hardy like goodly young Cedars; and their
Daughters fair and comely, like the curious caruings about the Temple; their
Oxen strong to labor, and their sheep fertile and fruitful; that there might
(...) nor foraine invasion: at length he windeth up all indeed with this
Epiphonema or Conclusion, Psalm. 144 15.
Blessed be the people that are in such a case: but on the neck of it he
comes as with an Epanorthoma, or a Correction of his former speech, Yea
rather blessed are the people that have Iehova for their God; that have the
Lord for their portion: This one blessing alone is better worth than all those.
So that as when the woman in the Gospel cried out to Christ, Luke 11 27.
Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps that gave thee suck: Our
Savior, as correcting her speech, (and yet Luke 1. 48.
true also that was) says, Luke 11. 28. Beatier Maria percipiendo fide^
Christi, quam concipiendo car^em Christi. Luke 1. 45. Inde foelix quia verbum
Dei custodivit. Luc. 2. 19. non quia in illa verbum caro factu^ est and
habitauit in nobis; sed quia custodiuit Dei verbu^, per quod facta est, and
quod in illo caro factum est. Aug. in Joan tract. 10.
Blessed are those rather that hear Gods word and keep it. So the Psalmist
haning pronounced them blessed that be in such a case, as eating in and
revoking his words again, as if he had spoken otherwise than well, Yea blessed
(says he) are they rather whose God is the Lord: As if he had said, That is
indeed an happiness in some kind, in some case: but yet that happiness is
nothing to this blessedness: for that is but external, this is internal;
that is but temporal, this is eternal.

Secondly, the greatest wealth in this world is of a Kingdom: and therefore
said he sometime in the profane Tragedy, that (...). Eteocles apud Eurip.
Phoeniss. Nam si violandum est ius, regnandi gratia violandum est: alijs rebus
pietatem ^olas. Cic. offic. l. ^. Nulla sancta societas, nec fides regni est.
Ennius apud eund l. 1. Nulla fides regni socijs. Lucan. l. 1.
If a man might break his word for ought, it should be to atchieue a Crown,
to compass a Kingdom. Yea not to be a King only, but to belong to a King in
some place near about him, is esteemed a matter of great worth and dignity,
and such as may prove a mean of much wealth and commodity to one that can
wisely make use of it. 1 King. 10. 8.
They were held happy men that could get into Salomons service. And it is the
greatest matter that Prou. 22. 29.
S^l^mon could promise the man that is diligent and industrious in the managing
of his affairs, that he shall stand before, Sic ^ Reg. 17. ^. and Dan. 7. 10.
that is, attend upon Princes, and not serve or wait upon any mean man.

If it be held such a matter then to retain and belong to some one of the
Princes of this world: De^ seruire regnare est. B^rn. de temp. 110. No^ maligno
aut mundano princ^p^, ^^d Christ^ vtique seruire regnare est. Idem, de bon.
deser.
What is it to appertain and belong to GOD, Apoc. 19. 16. 1 Timothy 6. 15.
the King of Kings, and Apoc. 1. 5.
the Prince of Princes, Psalm. 83. 18.
the highest Sovereign Luke 10. 21.
Lord of Heaven and Earth; Deponit reges, dispouit regna Dan. 2. 37. and 4. 22.
that deposes Kings and disposes of their Kingdoms at his pleasure; that
assign^th every earthly King the lists and limits both of his regiment and of
his reign? That which the Apostle Paul therefore prefixeth as no small credit
before sundry of his Epistles; and King David as a great grace before some of
his Psalms: Romans 1. 1. Philip. 1. 1. Tit. ^ 1.
Paul a servant of Jesus Christ: and, Psalm. 36. 1.
A Psalm of David the servant of God: as if it were Sanctitate mayor quam
p^^^state. Salnian, de prouid. l. 2. Quomodo de M. Ant^n^no Pe^rare. fam ep. 15
l. 7. Imperium adep^us philosophi nomen ro^inuit, maiu^ ^stima^s philosoph^

se membru^ esse magis qua^ regnare gaudebat.
a greater dignity to him, that he was Gods servant, then that he was ruler
and governor of Gods people.

But because Joh 8. 35.
the Servant is oft-times turned out at doors, whereas the Son abides in the
house for ever: And therefore the Father tells his Son in the Gospel; Luke
15. 31.
Son, thou art ever with me: and all that I have is reserved for thee. The
godly man is not only Servant to a King, but he is 1 Pet. 2. 9.
Son to such a King, and Luke 12. 3^.
borne, or rather Ioh. 3. 3, 5.
newborn, to a Kingdom.

And whereas earthly Kings, if they have many Sons, can leave the Crown but
to one. ^ Chron. 21. 3.
Iehosaphat (faith the Holy History) gave great gifts to his other Sons, but
the Kingdom gave he to ^oram; because he was the eldest God (...) Apoc. 1. 6.
and 10. 6.
all his Sons Kings and Apoc. 21. 7.
Heirs alike. For Romans 8. 17.
if we be Sons, says the Apostle, we are Heirs too; even coheires with
Christ, Hebr. 1. 2.
who is Heir of all.

But how can the Godly be so rich may some say, when he has, as it may fall
out, not a penny in his purse?

Thirdly therefore: A man may truly be said to be Rich in writing; the monied
man, though he have never a penny in the house, but Hinc illud Pallade: (...)
Et Po^^iani illud; (...) apud Stob. to^. 2. c. 10
all ou^ at interest; and the landed-man, though he hold not his lands in his
own hands, but have all let out and in the occupation of others, so long as he
has good security for the one, and good evidence, if need be, to show, for
the other. And as in Writing, so in Reuersion. Great sums of money do many
give for the reversions of offices, of lands and leases; and as much may they
make them again away for, if they will.

And in like manner may the Godly man be said to be rich both in Writing, and
in Reuersion: yea in either kind he is Affatim dives. est, qui cum Christo

beyond all the wealth of this world, than the purest gold does the drossiest
dirt.

And thus have we seen, both that Godliness is gainefull; and wherein the
Gain thereof does consistst.

Now the Use hereof is twofold, for Exhortation, for Examination.

For Exhortation first; to stir up all men to labor and take pains to get

world cannot show the like; Sic ab omnibus capitur, vt nil singulis minuatur
Ber. in Cant. 79.
Gain without any loss to, or hindrance of any: here is good Gain, and great
Gain; here is infinite gettings. Labor for Godliness; labor to get and
keep a good Conscience: It is the gainfull'st Trade in the world. Who so
follows this Trade, shall not venture upon uncertainties, he shall be sure to
thrive, and to get infinite Gain. For, Prou 21. 21.
He that follows after righteousness, as a man follows a trade, shall
find Honor, and Life, true Honor, and eternal Life.

And here come there two sorts of men to be admonished.

First, the Rich, that they content not themselves with their worldly wealth,
but that they seek withal to get the true spiritual Riches, that Animus
hominis dives, non area appellari solet quamai^ illa sit plena du^ te inanem
videbo divite^ non pu^abo. Cic. parad. 6. Ex anim^ rem stare ^quam puto, ^o^
animam exre. Auson.
themselves may be rich, and not their purse or their chest only; that they may
not be Luke 12. 21. Est^te Deo divites, no^ ^^m facturi di^item, sed de ^o
futuri divite^. Aug. de verb. Dom. 6.
rich to the world only, but rich also to God. Else their earthly Gain will
prove their loss; their worldly wealth will be but a means to hinder their
happiness by keeping them out of Heaven, where alone is true and entire
happiness to be had. It is that which our Savior himself says of the
worldly. Rich man, that has nothing to trust unto but his riches: (for so to
his Apostles Mark. 10. 24.
he expounds it himself:) that Math. 10. 24. Mark. 10. 25. Luke 18. 25.
It is easier for e a Camel; or, as some read the word, (...) Suid, Vise
(...), and (...).
a cable rope, to pass through the eye of a Needle, than for such a rich man
to enter into the kingdom of Heaven. As if our Savior should have said; It is
as easy a matter, nay an easier, to thread a small Spanish Needle with a thick
Cable, or a great Cart-rope, then to get such a Rich man in at heaven gate:
In^pta eni^ sunt, quae ex Lyra^^ Author Dialogi inter Divite^ and Pauperem, de

That great bunched beast, a Camel, may as soon, yea sooner be driven through
an needles narrow eye, than such a rich man be drawn unto God, and be brought
into the state of Grace. For so the most and the best read it; and it is an
ordinary by word both with Syrians and Greeks, when they speak of a thing
that they think altogether impossible, to say, (...) Casaubou. in notis ad
N^Test.
An Elephant, or a Camel may as soon creep through an Needles eye, as this
or that come to pass. But not so soon, says our Savior, but Difficilem
dixerat, impossibile^ iam di^cit. Hieron. in Math. 3. i^o impossibili magis
impossibilem. Euthym. in Math. c. 41.
sooner may that be done, which Math. 19. 26. Mark. 10. 2^.
with man is altogether impossible, than such worldly rich men attain to true
happiness. 2 Cor. 8. 9. Diuilia illius quid nobis facturae, cuius paupertas
no^ divites fecit? Aug. de verb. Apost. 15.
Christ (says the Apostle) became poor, to make us Rich. Quomodo pauper
factus est? quomodo divites facit? Aug. de temp. (...).
How became he poor? says one of the Ancients: ^^ how makes he us rich? The
same Apostle (says (...) shows us, and expounds himself, where he says;
2 Cor. (...).
He that knew no sin, for our sake became sin, by taking upon him the guilt
of our sin, that we might become the Puto quod Christi paupertas non pecuniam
nobis attulit, sed iustitiam and immortalitare^. Aug. ibid.
Righteousness of God in him. And indeed, to speak properly and precisely, as
the truth is, (...). Chrysostom. tom. 6. sermon. 78. de poenit. 2.
not as the world, but as God reckneth, Mai^r and miserabilior egestas nulla
est, quam egere sapientia, and qui sapientia non eget, nulla re omni^o egore
potest. stultitia ergo egest at est. Aug. de beata vita disput. 3. Paupertas in
animo est, non in sacoulo. Idem in Psalm. 131. Paupertas in inopia mentis est,
non in quantitate possessionis. Greg in Ezech. l. 2. hom. 18.
the only poverty is Sinfulness, and In animo diuitia sunt, non
inpatrimonio. Sen. ep. 108. Pa^u^ne divitia ipsa innocentia? si arcam plema^
auro habueris, dives eris: si cor habueris plenum innocentia, pauper er^^? Aug.
in Psalm. 83.
Righteousness the right Riches. And the rich man therefore that has not a
religious heart, is but like Apoc. 3. 17.
proud Laodicea, Quid tibi prosunt exteriores diuitia, si te interior premit
egestas? Aug. in Psalm 52. Tanto eni^ verius, quanto interius indigentes sum^^.
Greg. M. mor. l. 21. c. 14.
a poor beggarly wretch in Gods sight, and in the sight of those that see so
as he sees, howsoever he may seem rich and glorious in worldly men's eyes.

Yea to him that has it too, that is both rich and religious, may we well say,
as our Savior did to his Disciples, when they vaunted at their return from
preaching the Gospel, that even the Devils were subdued unto them; Luke 10. 20.
Rejoice ye not herein, that the Devils are subdued under you: so were they
under Judas too; but herein rejoice, that you have your names entered in heaven.
So Vise supra quod de Theodosio Aug. deciuit. Dei l. 5. c. 22.
rejoice not herein that thou art rich to the world, or that thou art great in
the world, and have others under thee, and at thy command; that thou art clad
gorgeously, and farest deliciously; (for Luke 16. 19.
so did that reprobate Rich man in the Gospel:) but herein rejoice that thou
art rich unto God, and 1 Pet. 3. 4. Vere dives, qui in Dei consp^ctu potest
dives videri. Ambr. epist. 10. sed solum illum divitem D^us novit, qui sit
dives aternitati. Ibid.
in his sight, that thou fear and seruest God, and 2 Cor. 1 12.
labourest to keep a good conscience, that thou art a 1 Pet. 4. 10.
careful dispenser and faithful disposer of that treasure that God has
entrusted thee withal. Then thou art 5 Paulo sap^e is omnis liber, 1 Cor. 7.
22. Peire etiam dives est. 1. Pet. 3. 4. Ambros. epist. 10 (...) Plato Ph^done.
S lu^ sapient dives est Ci^ parad. 6. and apud Apul de philos. (...). etc.
Philo de Nee. Qui pre^losissi^a qu^ sunt possidet, is dives est. ^iqui
pretiosissi^^ res virtus est: hanc ergo cum sapions solus possideat; sapions
solus dives est. Empir adv. Mathem.
truly Rich, when thou art sincerely religious, when thou art truly righteous.

Secondly, the poor, they are likewise to be admonished, to labor for
Godliness: that though they be not Luke 12. 21.
rich to the world, they may be rich yet to God; and their worldly poverty
shall be no hindrance to their spiritual preferment. For Iam 2. 5.
God (says the Apostle) has chosen the poor of this world to be rich in
grace, and heirs of his kingdom.

And here is great comfort for the poor man, that lives a godly life, and
makes Conscience of his courses, has a care to please God and to do his will
in all things, and to approve himself and his ways to him, walking faithfully
and painfully in the works of his calling, be it never so mean; that though he
be never so poor and bare, though he live but from hand to mouth, as we say;
yea though he have not one good rag to hang on his back, or one good morsel
of meat in a twelue-month to put in his mouth, though he have not the least
patch of land in the world to sustain him, or the least hole that may be to
hide his head in; Diuites dicimus sapientes, iustos, bonos; quibus pecunia vel
parua vel nulla: magis eni^ sunt virtutibus diuites: pauperis vero auaros
dicimus, semper inhiantes, semper egentes. Aug de ciu. l 7. c. 12. Pauper est

Lactant. instit. l. 5. c. 14.
yet is he a rich man for all that, richer than Crassus or Croesus, or the
wealthiest worldly man again in the world. For they have but Luke 16. 11.
the false Riches, he the true treasure; they have but the counterfeit Vitreum
margaritum, non verum. Hieron. post Tertull.
glassie pearl; he has that precious orient pearl, which Math. 13. 46.
the wise Merchant, when he has found, is content to sell all that ever he
has to purchase it, to forgo all that ever he is worth for the compassing of
it; and yet is he no looser by the bargain neither. For as he is a Merchant,
so is he also a wise Merchant; and therefore knows well what he does in so
doing: he knows that in buying it, he buyeth himself and his own safety,
his own eternal salvation, together with it.

Again, this serves to overthrow the opinion of such persons as think that
there is little or no Gain to be gotten under God, little or no good at all to
be gathered in Gods service. So the worldly men in Jobs day; Job. 21. 15.
Who is the All-sufficient, say they, that we should serve him? or what profit
should we have by praying unto him? And the wicked in Malachies time; Malac. 3.
14.
It is but in vain to serve God: there is nothing to be gotten by keeping his
commandments, and walking humbly before him.

Yea but, may some say, sure there be none such now a-dayes, especially among
us that make profession of Christianity; and therefore this use of the point
might well be spared.

If it be so with us, Quiescat lingua, loquaturvita. Aug. in 1. Joan.
Efficacius est testimonium vita quam lingua. Aut^r de dupl martyr.
let our Actions answer for us; let our practice prove it: And so we will turn
the Use from Reprehension to Examination, from Confutation to Conviction.

Let every one by these Notes then examine himself, whither he be of this
Opinion or no.

First, did men deem Godliness to be a matter of Gain, they would never
think they had enough of it. For (...) Eusebius apud Stob. t^m. 2. c. ^0.

Auarus animus nullo satiatur lucre. S^n. ^p. 49.
Riches are stintlesse; there is no end of them. We never think that we have
wealth enough; we are still laboring for more. Fortune multis (...)dat, ^^lli
satis. Martial. l. 12. epigr. 10.
Many men have too much, and yet no man enough. There is no stint of wealth;
but as Non aliud an^^al eu ^^nore origin in ma^^^^^ cr^scit magnitudine^ (...)
Plin. hist. ^^^. l. 8. c. 25.
some write, though ^ise ^ul. ^^^ig d^ subtle (...).
fabulously, of the Crocodile, that he grows so long as ever he lives: so it
is too too true of this mystical Crocodile, the desire of gain and wealth,
and of advancing or enlarging men's worldly estates, has no acme, no^ pitch,
but grows still more and more with men as long as they live, Auaritia morbus
senum proprius, lu^uria iuvenum: libidinis siquidem ignis pau^^tim extinguitur,
and cum senectute consenescit: at auaritia augescit continuo, and cum senectute
ipsa iuvenescit. Kolloc. in 1 Timothy 6. 10. Quid auaritia, quae rad^^ est omnium
maloru^, nonne in frigidis senibus tanto ad acquirendum feruentius inardescit,
qua^to eitius relictura est quod acquirit? Aug. de temp. 246.
rifer often with them then ever, when they are even going out of the world, and
have one foot, as we use to say, already in the grave.

But with Godliness men are soon satisfied; they have soon enough of it. If
they have attained to but a little superficial sprinkling of common Grace, or
civil honesty, that comes as far short of sound sanctification and
sincerity, as the shadow does of the substance; they begin presently to
suppose, with selfe-conceited Apoc. 3. 17.
Laodicea, that they are rich enough and need nothing; that Quomodo proficis,
fi tibi ^am sufficis? Bern. de consider. l. 2. Omnia i^^ desunt, qui sibi nihil
deesse putat. Ib.
they have no need to labor for any further matter, they are even as well as
well may be, as need be, at least.

No man is afraid of being too wealthy: but Nosti illud, Ne^^ p^^^ est, qui

being ouer-rigorous in censuring of others; like Luke 18. 11.

wittily, Dum in se singulariter ^^^^tat, aliji arroganter insultat; and se
solum decipit, quem solum excipit, dum al^^^ damnat. Lern. de grad. humil.
exulting arrogantly in himself insulteth insolently over others, and
deceives himself alone, whom alone he excepteth, while he contemns and
condemns all besides himself.

Secondly, Men would strive one to go beyond an other in Godliness, if they
counted Godliness a matter of Gain. For as the Heathen Writer well observes,
* (...). Hesiod. Vicimus dives cupiditatem irritat. Sen. epist. 7.
there is a kind of emulation commonly among worldly neighbors, whereby they
emulate such as go beyond them in wealth: one neighbor strives to out-build
an other, one to get and purchase more than another. The covetous man casts
his eye on his rich neighbors, * hunc atque hune superare laborat: Vt quum
carceribus ^^ss^s rapit vngula currus Instat equis auriga suos vincentibus
illum praeteritum temnens eutremos inter euntem. Herat. sermon, l. 1. sat. 1.
as a man in a race does on those that have won ground of him, he strives to
get even with this man, whom he is yet behind, to outstrip that man, whom he
has got even withal. And the envious man (as those two vices are seldom
asunder) looking through the spectacles of envy on his neighbors goods,
Fertilier seges est alienis semper in aruis: vicinumque pecus grandius vber
^abet. Ovid. artis l. 1. (...) nobis, nostra (...)t. P. Syrus.-maior^ videtur,
Et melior vi^^na seges. Juven: sat. 14.
thinks every thing that his neighbor has better than his own and it may be
better than indeed it is, his grounds fertiler, his beasts fairer, his revenues
larger, his gains greater etc. and is ready enough often to say with himself,
Why should not my beasts look a^ ^^ire a^ hi^? why should not my grounds yield
as much as hi^? why should not I thrine as well as he, having as good ^^dnes to
thrine by a^ he has

And even (...). Plat^ d^ (...). ^.
so wo^^^^ be with us, held we Godliness to be gainefull. We would have a
kind of godly emulation and ambition among us, as the Apostle speaks, in
matter of Godliness; we would even (...). 1. Cor. 12. 31. (...). 1. Cor. 14.
1. (...). 2. Cor. 9. 2.
emulate, and (...). Romans 15. 2^. ^ Cor. 5. 9. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 11.
ambitiously, as it were, strive and contend to out-go one an other in goodness
and grace. And this were (...). Hesiod.
a good and godly emulation, a goodly and a commendable strife and contention
indeed. We would be eying of those that are got beyond us in grace, and
endeavor to get even with them, yea, if it be possible, to outstrip them, and
to cast them behind us, Qui stadium currit, eniti and contendere debet, quam
maxim possit, vt vincat: supplantare eum qu^cum certet, aut manis depellere
nullo modo debet. Chrysippu^ apud Cicer. offic. l. 3.
not by hindering their progress, but by mending our own pace, and Faciamus
quod in itinere fieri solet: qui tardius exieru^t, velocitate pe^sant moram.
Senec. not. quaest. l. 3. praefat. Quod facere solent, qui serius exeunt, and
volunt tempus celeritate reparare, calcar add^mus. Idem epist. 68.
by straining our selves to run the faster, the later it was ere we entered
into this race. We would be as ready as they are to say to our selves; And why
should not I be as forward in the fear of God, as Zealous, as religious, as I
see such and such are, since I have as good means of being godly as they have,
as many inducements as either they or any other can have?

But so stand the most affected, that they will not by their good will suffer
any man to out-go them in wealth, in the way of the world: but they will let
any man willingly out-go them in grace, and in the good ways of God: there
only we strain courtesy, and give every one the way of us. And as our
Savior tells the Scribes and Pharisees, that Math. 21. 31.
the very Publicans and Harlots might go into the kingdom of Heaven before
them: So not a few among us will suffer the very Pagans, and Papists, little
better than Pagans, if not worse many of them than they, the very Heathen and
Heretics to go into heaven before them, ere they will strive to out-go them in
goodness and godliness.

Thirdly, men would be more affected with it, if they supposed any matter of
Gain to be in it. Populus me sibilat; at mihi plau do Ipse domi, simulat
nummos contemplor in arca. Horat. sermon. l. 1. sat. 1.
The covetous miser, says the Heathen man, while the people either curse or
hi^^e at him abroad, yet he pleases and cheereth himself the whilst with the
sight or the consideration of his substance at home. It does a man good at the
very heart, even to think upon his riches, and but Eccles. 5. 10.
to look upon his treasure. It will make our hearts to spring and leap within
us for joy, to have sudden news brought us of some rich legacy, or large
patrimony by some means befallen us.

But of this spiritual wealth and gain most men are merely stupide and
senseles: No more moved commonly or affected, when either, (if any time at
least they so do,) they think on it, or when they hear it spoken of in the
Pulpit; then (as a Philosopher said sometime of an ignorant Dol^ ^itting in the
Theater, where the seats were of marble, that (...). Aristipp^^ apud L^^^tium
l. 2.
One stone sat upon an other:) then, I say, either the benches that they sit
upon, or the pillars that they lean against: Not once stirred at all to hear
of the heavenly inheritance, or of holiness, the means that must bring them
to heaven, yea that works in men's hearts a kind of Philip. 3. 20.
heaven upon earth, and gives Christian men seizin of heaven even while they
live here. An evident argument that either they believe not the Gain of it, or
they believe not themselves to have any share in it.

Fourthly, men would be often taking account of their Gains in this kind, of
their thriuing in Godliness, if they held Godliness to be so gainefull. (...).
Worldly men are very frequent and diligent herein, very careful to keep
their books of receipt and expense, poaring ever and anon on them, running often
over their reckonings, and casting up their accounts, to see how they thrive or
pare in the world, how they go forward or backward in wealth.

But where we shall find a man that has the like care of keeping and casting
up his spiritual accounts, of Ps 4. 4 and 119. 59. Zeph. 2. 1. 1. Cor. 11. 28.
2. Cor. 13. 5.
examining himself for his spiritual estate, how he thriueth or pareth with
the graces of Gods Spirit, how he goes forward or backward in goodness or
Godliness? And yet would our care be alike for either, did we equally
apprehend the gain of either. But let us look unto it. For whither we call
our selves to account here or no, God will questionless one day call us to an
account. And then not only Luke 15. 13.
the prodigal Son, and the Luke 16. 1.
unfaithful Steward, that has the one unthriftily lauished out his
patrimony, and the other riotously wasted his masters wealth; but Math. 25. 30.
the idle and unprofitable Servant to^, that has not gained with his Talent,
that has not thriuen with the Grace of God bestowed on him, shall be bound
hand and foot, and cast out into utter darkness, where shall be weeping and
wailing, and gnashing of teeth.

Fifthly, men would make more account of Godliness, if they counted it as
Gain. Did they indeed account Godliness more gainefull than Gain, they would
not put Godliness away for Gain, they would not prefer Gain before
Godliness. Yea did they deem Godliness the gainfullest thing in the world,
they would not forgo Godliness for a world of wealth, or for ought else that
were in the world.

But it is with it, as it is with Time. It is a common saying in every man's
mouth, that (...). Theophrastus apud L^^rtium and Anti^ho apud Plutarch.
Antonio.
There is nothing in the world more precious than Time, and yet Quem mihi dabis

there is nothing generally more trifled away than it. So of Godliness the
most will (in word at least) acknowledge, that there is nothing in the world
more gainefull than it, and yet the most of them that so say, stick not to
make it away for mere trifles. Ad mere^^^ ^ij sumus; ad mercede^ impij.

Godly they are content to be for advantage, so long as Godliness brings in
any worldly Gain with it, or so long as there is no hope of any the like Gain
by ungodliness. But let Godliness cease to bring in such Gain, they grow
soon weary of it: or let but the least hope of such Gain by ungodliness show
it self, and they are ready presently to exchange Godliness for it.

Matthew. 16. 26.
What should it avail a man, says our Savior, to win the whole world, and
loose his own soul? It were no Gain for a man to get the whole world by
ungodliness; since he must withal loose himself, his life, his soul for his
labor. But we are ready and willing, the most of us, to part with Godliness,
and forgo good Conscience, for far less matters then that comes to, for a
penny or an halfe-penny toy now and then; to exchange it for some small piece
or patch of the world, for some sorry snip or stired of the pelf of it, or for
ought else that we have some fond fancy unto, the covetous worldling for a
little temporary treasure, and the lascivious wanton for a little transitory
pleasure: like Hebr. 1^. 13. ex Genesis 25. 33.
profane Es^^, that sold his birthright for a mess of broth, and Pr. 28 21.
Frusto pa^^^ co^^^ci potest, vel vti tac^at, v^l vti loqu^^ur. ^ato in C^liu^
apud G^lliu^ l. 1. c. 15.
Salomons unjust judge, that would d^ (...) (...) a (...)se^^ of bread, and
Ezech. 13. 9.
the false Prophets in Eechiels time, that would pollute Gods name for an
handful of barley.

That which evidently shows at how low a rate most men value Godliness. For
as a Abst^m: in fabulis.
scoffing companion sometime told the Bishop that would give him his blessing
when he would not give him an halfe-penny, that If his blessing had bin worth
an halfe-penny, he should not have had it. So if worldly men thought
Godliness, and the Fear and Favor of God worth but an halfe-penny, they
would not venture to put either away for an halfe-penny matter: they would not
so readily exchange either for trifles, did they not make but a trifling matter
of either.

Neither may the greater sort of such men avoid this imputation, and wash
their hands with Math. 27. 24.
Pilate from the soil of this sin, because they are wont to make Godliness
away for greater matters. To omit (...). Plato apud Plut. de vtil. ex inimic.

Amphitr. 2. 2.
that even the greatest of them will bear no weight at all, if they be laid in
the balance against Godliness, when the whole world it self is too light to
weigh against it. Thou thy self, who ever thou art, wilt cry out shame on some
poor silly wretch, that shall forswear himself, and so damn his soul, as
thou thy self say, for a penny, when thou do thy self, it may be, in
effect as much for somewhat more. But do thou consider, as (...). Aristippus
apud Laert. l. 2.
Aristippus sometime told Plato, that a penny may be as much to him as a pound
is to thee, and a pound no more with thee than a penny with him: and therefore
do thou value Godliness at as low a rate in stretching and straining of thy
Conscience for the one, as he in tentering it for the other.

Lastly, men would be content to take more pains for the compassing and
increasing of it in themselves, if they held Godliness to be gainefull. Men
can well endure to sit telling and taking money, and it were all day long, from
morning to dark night: But to hear the word, but an hour, whereby the
spiritual Gain is gotten, the most can hardly endure: they sit all that while
on thorns, and think every minute an hour, and are never well till all be
done. They say, or think at least with themselves, as the profane Jews
sometimes said, (...) Malac. 1. 12.
What a toil, or a tediousnes is here? what needs so much preaching? what
needs so long praying? they think they might be as well, if not much better,
without either: Yea many can not endure so long as till the hour be at an end.
To whom God may well say, as our Savior to his drowsy Disciples, Math. 26. 40.
What, could ye not watch an hour with me? So, Can ye not endure to wait an
hour on me, that watch so many over you? On Si ab isia hora, qua verbum Dei
praedicare ceperim, gemm^s, vel annulos, vel monilia erogarem, an non filij mei
stare and accipere vellent? etc. Aug. homil. 26.
worldly Mammon they could be well content to wait all day long, with
forbearance not of disport only, but of ordinary diet too, that would think
much but half an hour in the day to wait upon him.

Again, (...). Antipha apud Stob. c. 10. Cogit auarities miser^s and caca
cupido Noctes at^ dies niti praest^^te labor, Lu^^^^. de not. rer^m lib. 3.
for worldly wealth men can toil and moile all the week long; and yet are
they not weary; they think not the whole week long enough neither: But for
the heavenly Gain, for the spiritual thrift, we have but one day of seven,
and we think that too much too: we think the day all too long, the labor all
lost, and the whole time cast away, that we employ and spend to this purpose.
We say as the same Jews at an other time said; Amos 8. 5.
When will the New Moon be past; and the Sabbath once over? that we may
return again unto our worldly affairs. Yea many among us have not the
patience to tarry so long, but spend a great part of the Sabbath, that is Gods
Market or Mart-day, for the getting of this spiritual Gain, either about
their worldly affairs. or their bodily delights.

The Sabbath day, I say, is Gods Market Day. And those that seek to take away
the Sabbaths, attempt to put down Gods Markets, and so do the Devil good
service, whatsoever their intent be. As frequenting of Markets makes a Rich
man; so keeping of Sabbaths makes a rich Christian. And as we count him a bad
Husband, that follows Game on the Market Day: so may we as well count him a
spiritual unthrift, that spends the Sabbath in that sort.

But may some say, when we have bin at Church, and heard the Sermon and
Service, is not Gods Market Day then done?

I answer: If the Sabbath be Lecit. 23. 32. Matthew. 28. 1.
a day, then is it not so soon done. Debet totus dies festium a Christiano
expendi in operibus sanctis. Rob. Grosthed Lincoln. Epist. in Decalog. pracept.
3.
Gods Market lasts all day long.

Yea, grant the principal, because the public, of it be past: yet as
Market-folks returning from Market will be talking of their Markets, as they
go by the way, and be casting up of their penny-worths, when they come home,
reckon what they have taken, and what they have laid out, and how much they
have gotten: So should we, after we have heard the word publicly, confer
privately of it with others; at least meditate on it by our selves, and be sure
to take an account of our selves, how we have profited that day by the word
that has bin spoken unto us, and by other religious exercises that have bin
used of us. And as the Marketman counts that but an evil market day, that he
has not gained somewhat on more or less: So may we well account it an evil
Sabbath to us, whereon we have not profited somewhat, whereon we have not
either increased our knowledge, or bin bettred in affection; whereon we have
not bin further either informed in judgment, or reformed in practice, whereon
we have added no whit at all to our Talent.

To wind up all in a word. If we hold Godliness to be, as the Apostle here
says it is, a matter of Gain, and of great Gain, that which makes Gain to
be Gain, and without which Gain it self is no Gain indeed; that Omnia
adsunt bona, quem penes est virtus. (pietas.) Plaut. Amphitr. 2. 2.
it brings all good with it to him that has it; and that it never leaves
him, but abides with him, and sticks by him for ever: Oh let us labor then
to get of it, and to grow more and more in it; let us endeavor to out-go one an
other in Godliness; let us call our selves to a reckoning how we thrive or
pare in it; let us (...). Solo^ apud Plut. d^ ^ig^^^ (...) and d^ ^tili^.
(...). and do tranquil.
not put it away for such trifles and toys as the world or the (...).
Chrysostom. tom 7. eclog. 30 and tom. 6. sermon. 73. and in Math. ho^. 3.
Devil shall tender unto us to bereave us of so precious a pearl; Especially
let us have a care of frequenting Esai. 55. 1.
Gods markets, of observing Gods Sabbaths, the principal means of increasing
this spiritual wealth in us. So shall it come to pass that we shall have God
to be our portion; we shall be heirs of his Kingdom, and coheires with his
Christ; we shall have all the good things both of this life and the next
assured unto us here, and the full fruition of them for ever hereafter.

The end of the first Part.
THE SECOND PART. The Sufficiency of it in it Self.
HItherto of the maine Point, to wit, that Godliness is great Gain. Now
because this Proposition will not either easily enter into men's minds, or
sinck suddenly into their hearts: The Holy Ghost by the Apostle is content to
bring a double proof of it.

The one drawn from the time present; because it is able alone to give a man
Contentment here, that which all the world else is not able to do, expressed in
this verse:

The other taken from the time to come; because it will continue with and abide
by a man for ever hereafter, that which no worldly wealth, or ought else in the
world can do, implied in the Verse. 7.
next verse.

Godliness with Contentment, or, (...)
with Self-sufficiencie: For so it is word for word in the Original; and the
word so properly imports. As if he had said: Godliness and Contentment are
two inseparable Companions, that continually harbor and keep house together,
that go ever hand in hand the one with other: so that a man can not have the
one without the other, he cannot want the one if he have the other. There is no
true Godliness, where there is not Contentment of Mind; no true Contentment
of Mind, where Godliness is not.

So that the Apostle seems to reason on this wise.

That which of it self is sufficient to content the mind of Man, that is true
Gain, and great Gain indeed: For it is no small matter that will suffice to
stay and settle Man's mind.

But Godliness is of it self sufficient to content the Mind of Man, and does
ever bring true Contentment with it to him that has it.

Godliness therefore is true Gain and great Gain indeed.

Hence then may we deduce these three Conclusions to be considered of in order:

1. That Contentment of Mind is a most precious Treasure.

2. That Godliness alone can produce and procure this Contentment.

3. That true Contentment is an undoubted Argument of Godliness.

For the first: (...). Epicur. ap ud Laert.
Contentment of Mind is an invaluable, an inestimable Treasure. For it is that
indeed that makes Riches to be Riches. Quis dives? qui nil cupiat. quis

Riches, as the Heathen man truly observes, consist not so much in the
possession of tem, as in the fruition of them. But it is Contentment a lone
that gives a man a comfortable use and fruition of what he has, that
procures him profit and pleasure of what he possesses. For Vltra se cupidttas

where a man rests not content with what he has, there is the mind so
carried after that he further desires and has not, that he no more regards
or joyeth in what he has, Avaro ta^ d^est quod habet, quam quod (...) multa,

than if it were not at all. And where a man is discontent with his present
estate, there is all that he has, be it never so much, rather a burden than
any way a benefit unto him; like meat that a, greeing not with the stomach,
lies in it undigested, and not only proves unpleasant and unprofitable,
affording neither good relish nor sound nourishment, but noisome also and
burdensome to the whole body. So that where Contentment is not, a man
regards nothing: and where Discontent is, it infecteth and tainteth all
things, and so makes them, as if some malignant blast had blown on them,
unsavory and distasteful to him that so has r Non domne and (...) a (...)

A sick man is alike sick, wheresoever ye lay him, on a bed of gold, or on a
pad of straw, with a silken quilt or with a sorry rug on him. So no more can
riches, gold and silver, land or living, had a man much more than ever any man
had, minister unto him much joy, yea or any true and sound joy at all, where
the mind is distract and discontent: without Contentment there is no joy of
ought; there is no profit, there is no pleasure in ought. Eccles. 2. 10.
All without it is but vanity and vexation of Spirit.

Will we see this by an Example or two further confirmed to us? Haman, was he
not a most happy man, as the world accounts happiness, Nemo foelix est, qui
iudicio suo miser est. Salvian. de provid. lib. 1. Non est beatus, esse se qui
non putat. P. Sir. Miser est qui. se non beatissimum iudicat. Sen. ep. 10.
if he could have thought so himself? Ester 3. 1, 2.
the next man in the Kingdom to the King himself, the greatest one of them
that then was; he took place by the Kings appointment of all the Princes his
Peers, and all the Kings Court, by the Kings express command, bowed and did
obeisance to him: Ester 5. 13.
he vaunteth himself of his glory, the multitude of his children, the
abundance of his treasure, his especial favor and inwardnes both with the
King and the Queen: enough a man would think to content any man Egens aque

Herenn. l. 4.
that had not an unmeasurable mind. And yet, says he, that is the conclusion
of his discourse, Ester. 5. 13. O dives, nescis quam pauper fis. quam inops
tibi ipsi videris, qui te divite^ dicis? Ambr. de Nabuth. cap. 2.
all this does me no good: It was all as good as nothing to him; he was never
the better for all this, so long as he wanted a cap and a courtesy of
Mordecai; because Mordecai bowed not the knee unto him, nor adored him, as
other the Kings Courtiers did. It was with him, (...) Plut. de tranquil.
as with little children, (says an Heathen man well of such) playing in the
streets, who, if some man as he passes by take one of their toys from them,
are ready to cast all the rest away from them, though they have many more left,
and sit crying and whining for that one that is gone.

Pass we from a Kings favorite to a King himself. King Ahab had land and
living enough and enough, (much more than 1. King. 16. 16.
his Father Omri was ever borne to,) had he not wanted this Contentment of
mind. But 1. King. 21. 1, 2, 3, 4.

made him poorer than poor Naboth, that desired nothing that he had; and
deprived him of his whole Kingdom that he had no profit of it, took no
pleasure in it; but, like a man that were in extreme want and necessity, he
gets him home to his house, and shuts himself up in his Chamber, like one
that durst not be seen abroad for fear of arrests; he casts himself on the
bed and refuses his meat, like a man that took thought for the payment of his
debts: He fares, in a word, as the former Author says of such, (...). Plut.

only, but in truth, having and enjoying that by Gods free gift, that none

Genes. 3. 1, 2, 3.
Adam and Eve our first Parents, albeit they were in the garden of Eden, (a
place abounding, as (...) Paradisii voluptatis. Vulg. hortos delicatissimos.
Leo Iud.
the word imports, with matter of pleasure and delight) amids all earthly
happiness; and had the whole world in their hands, and all the Creatures at
command: yet no sooner had the Devil sown this unhappy seed of Discontent
(the very first sin of theirs, as I take it with some other Reverend) in
their hearts, but they began presently to deem themselves poor and in want,
because they had not what they would; they account themselves as deprived and
debarred of all things, if they may not have the fruit of that one tree that
was only denied them, and Genesis 2. 17.
of which God had foretold them, that whenever Genesis 3. 3.
they touched it or tasted of it, it would be their bane. As if some great rich
man, or mighty Monark, having wealth in abundance, and the world at will, even
whatsoever heart could wish, yet should think himself streitned and cut
short, but a miserable creature, or not so happy as he might be, because he can

longing after his own evil, when he has good enough at hand, as if it were
misery for a man to want that, though he have no need of it, that would but
hurt him if he had it. Ye see, that a man may be in Paradise, (I might well
say, in heaven too, as the Devil once was,) and yet not be happy, if he have
not a contented mind.

As on the other side, where this Contentment of Mind is, there is wealth even
in want, much more cheerefulnes in wealth: There is, as a stay of the desire,
so a resting and a rejoicing in that a man enjoys: and therefore a
comfortable usage of it, be it more or less, because content in it. It is that
alone that seasoneth all: it is that alone that sweetneth all: It is that that
is able, not only to season those things that are sweet and pleasant in their
own nature, but even Animus ^q^^^ optimu^ est ^rum^^ condimentu^. Plaut.

to sweeten also those things unto a man, that are harsh and unpleasant in
themselves.

It is Contentment therefore only that makes a man truly wealthy, because it
freeth him from want, and gives him comfort of that he has. And as a (...).
Plut. de tranquil.
piece of dry bread is more sauoury to a man when he is in health, than all the
dainties in the world are when he is heart-sick: So a little, says Sal^man,
even Pro. 17. 1. (...) (...) St^^. (...) 2. c. ^ 5.
a morsel of dry bread is better and more with quiet and content, than a whole
house full of fat beasts with an unquiet heart, than a whole world of wealth
with a discontented mind.

Now two ways may this point be useful unto us.

First, to inform us, what cause they have to be thankful unto God, be they
rich or poor, whom he has vouchsafed this grace unto, whom Philip. ^. 11, 12.
he has taught, in whatsoever estate they are, therewith to be content. For
even the poorest man that lives content with his present estate, is richer
than the richest man in the world that has not a contented mind: he is
happier than Adam and Eve were sometime in Paradise, when they longed to eat of
the fruit forbidden them: Sensit Alexander test a cum vidit in illa Mag^u^

A merry heart, or a contented mind, (for it is not spoken directly of a good
Conscience, as it is commonly taken; (though it be true also of that, and that
be a mean to procure this;) as may appear both by the opposition of the other
member, and by the sequel of the context) is a perpetual banquet, a
continual feast.

The poor man then has as great cause to be thankful to God for his
Contentment of mind, as ^ (...) omnes ^ies afflict^ mali. Sic^^ Genesis 47* 9.

the Rich man for his riches. Conceive it by this Comparison. Suppose two men
lie sick of the same disease, a burning Fever, or some such like hot disease,
as causes drought and desires drink, and call both instantly for cold water
to quench their thirst with. The Physician coming to them, bids give the
one that is more impatient, a good quantity of cold drink, and yet he cries
and calls still for more. To the other he ministers himself a little
cons^rue on the point of a knife, that slaketh his thirst and asswageth his
drought. Whether of the twain in this case is more beholden unto him? So here;

he gives a Competencie, some small pitance, but Contentment withal, as a
little Physical Confection, that stinteth and stays his desire. Whether of
the twain, think we, have more cause to be thankful unto him, and to
acknowledge his goodness toward them? The latter doubtless, as he enjoys the
greater benefit, so he has greater cause of thankfulness to him from whom he
has it.

Again this may serve to incite us to labor earnestly for this Contentment,
and to pray instantly unto God for it.

And it is hard here to say, whether a man had more need to persuade the poor
man to be content with his poverty, or the rich man with his riches. For as

As Number. 9. 17, 18.
the Children of Israel therefore passing along the wilderness, marched
forward on their way when the Cloud went that conducted them, but there stood
still where it stayed. So may our affections walk on, while Gods hand goes
before them: but look where God stays his hand and cease to give, there
should our heart stay likewise, and we cease to desire.

To persuade our hearts the rather hereunto, use we a double consideration,
concerning others, and concerning our selves.

Concerning others, either those that go beyond us in riches, or those that
come short of us in wealth.

If no wealth then can stay, or satisfy the mind of man, what must? or what
may? The Apostle points us to it, as here, so else where. Heb. 139.
It is good, says he, to have the heart stayed, or ballaced as it were, with
grace, and not with meats, nor with money neither. That that must keep the
ship stiff and steedy on the Sea, must not be leauers and shores without it,
but Namque labant curvae iusto fi^e pondere naves, Perque mare instabiles nimia

weight and ballast within it. So that that must stay a man's raging and ranging
desires, must not be the outward supporting of his worldly estate, but the
inward ballacing and settling of the heart and mind; that which Gods grace
alone can do, as the Apostle speaks there, which is the same in effect with
Godliness, of which he entreats here. And in regard hereof it is that the
Psalmist says, that Psalm. 37. 16.
A small matter to the godly, the man that fears God, is much better than the
greatest wealth and riches, that the ungodly and the mighty has or can have.
And Solomon, that Prove. 15. 16.
a little with the fear of God is much better than great treasures and trouble
or vexation therewith.

In which words also Solomon closely and covertly renders a reason of that
which his Father David had before him said, why A little to the godly man should
be of more worth, even the same in effect that the Apostle here has, because
there is no trouble or vexation of mind, but quietness and sweet contentment
withal. According to that which the same Solomon els-where says; Pro. 10 22.

propitius negat. Aug. de diverse. 20. ^ Psalm. 106. 15.
God gives a man money many times in his wrath: as in the wilderness he gave
the Israelites meat in his anger: And so the curse of God many times makes a
man rich: But those riches are but accursed riches; Multis parasse divitias non
fini^ miseriaru^ suit, sed mutatio. S^n. ep. 17. Du^ maiore torme^to pecunia
possidet^r, quam queritur. ^a^ epist. 115. Nemo solicito bono fruitur. Ide^.
ep. 14. Ta^lis parta mal^ (...)tuque (...). Misera est (...). J^v^n. sa^. ^^.
there is a curse and car^ing care, ever accompanying such wealth. But where
Gods blessing makes a man rich, there he gives ever withal contentment, that
causes comfort and quiet of mind, and makes a man rest satisfied and well
apaid with that portion of wealth, be it more or less, that God has assigned
him.

Neither is this a common courtesy that God casts on all sorts
indifferently; but a peculiar blessing that he bestows on those only that
love and fear him, and that are his beloved ones. Psalm. 128 1, 2.
Blessed is every one, says the Psalmist, that fears God, and that walks
in his ways: For thou, that so do, shall eat of the (...) Sept. quod vetus

labors of thine hands: happy shall thou be, and it shall go well with thee.
But, c Unless the Lord build the house, they labor but in vain that build
it: It is vain for you, as worldly men are wont to do, to rise up early in the
morning, and sit up late at evening, and toil and moile, like an horse, all
the day long, and to eat the bread of sorrow and care; for, it is God that
gives his beloved rest: It is he alone that can give sweet comfort, and
quietness, and contentment of mind, and this grace he vouchsafes to none but
his beloved, to the Godly that love him, and are beloved of him.

It is Godliness then alone, that can cause true Contentment; and that can
cause true Contentment alone.

Godliness alone is able to cause true Contentment: because Godliness alone
brings man home unto God, out of whom true Contentment can not be had. For
the soul of man, as Genes. 1. 26, 27. and 9. 5. 1. Cor. 11. 7. Ephesians. 4. 24.
it bears the image of God; so Psalm. 17. 15. Omnis copia qu^ non est Deus
meus, mihi est egestas. Aug. soliloq c. 13. Dei imaginem animam nisi Deus nil
implet. Vise Aug. de civit. lib. 12. cap. 1.

Our Soul, says Augustine well, was created as by God, so for God, and is
therefore never quiet till it rest in God. As Hinc est quod huc illuc

man fell at first into this restlesnes by falling away from God; so Hoc adepto

he can not be recovered of it, but by returning to him again. It is with man's
soul in this regard, as it was with Noah's Dove in the Deluge. As Genes. 8. 9.
the Dove, after she left the Arc, found no rest for the soale of her foot in
the wide world, being then all a-floate, till she betook her again thither,
from whence before she came forth: So neither can man, fallen from God, find
any sure rest for the foot of his soul in the whole world beside, till he
come back to him again Eccles. 12. 7. Genes. 2. 7.
from whom it came at the first. But it is Godliness alone, that brings man
home unto God; that tyeth and knitteth the soul fast unto God; whereof Hoc
vin^ulo pietatis obst^^^^, Deo relig^^^ sumu^, vnde and ips^ Relig(...)accepi^,

(...). 13.
Religion, say some, has its name; that finds rest and repose for the whole
man in God, which can no where else be found. That which Solomon, out of his
own experience, confirms unto us, who Eccles. ^. ^^, 11.
having ranged abroad through all those creatures and courses, under the cope
of heaven, wherein any hope of contentment seemed to show forth it self, is in
conclusion enforced to retire back again to God, Eccles. ^^. 1.
directing them all to him that desire to find true contentment, and pointing
them the way to him Eccles. ^2. ^^.
by the fear of him; that is, by Godliness leading them unto God, that they
may with him and in him find true Contentment, as being no where else to be
had.

Godliness then, you see, is alone able to cause true Contentment. But is
Godliness, may some say, able to cause true Contentment alone, without help
and aid of these outward things? Can it make a man content as well in want as
in wealth? whither he have worldly wealth or no?

Yea undoubtedly. That that is sufficient of it self alone to make a man truly
happy, is of it self alone sufficient to give true contentment, though a man
have nothing else but it. For Aristot. ethic. l. 1. c. 7. Sed and Aug. confess.
l. 10. c. 20. and Epist. 121. c. 4, 5. and de lib arb. l. 1. c. 18. and de
Triuit. l. 13. c. 3, 4, 5, 7. and in Psalm. 118. conc. 1.
Happiness is every man's utmost aim: and he that has attained to it, can not
but rest content with it: Nemo beatus qui eo quod amat (quod avet, quod habet)
non fruitur. Aug. de civit. l. 8. c. 9. Fruimur autem eis in quibus voluntas
delectata conquiescit. Aug. de trinit. l. 10. c. 10. and Aquin. su^. p. 1 a. 2
a. q. 11. a. 3. Vnde Sen. Nemo fruitur bono solicito.
he were not happy, if he found no content in his happiness. Whatsoever thing
therefore is able to bring us unto happiness, can not but bring to us
Contentment together with it. But Godliness is of it self alone able to make
a man happy. That which (...) Plutarch. Ad viuendu^ beat virtus sola sufficit.
Se^. de vit beat. cap. 16. Beata vita virtus satisfacit. Ide^ epist. 87. Virtus
ad explendam beata^ vitam sola satis effica^. Ibid. 45.
the Heathen men said of their moral Virtue, a mere shadow of it, is indeed
true of true Godliness, it is sufficient of it self to make him that has it
truly happy, though he have nothing else but it. For Apoc. 20. 6. Inde beatus,
vnde bonus. Aug. epist* ^2^. Impius and f^li^ sic simul esse cupit, vt nolit
pius esse, velit tamen esse beatus; Quod natura negat, nec recepit ratio. d^
Macrino apud Capitolinum.
holiness and happiness, Godliness and blessedness are inseparably lincked
together, and can not be severed the one from the other. Psalm. 1. 1. and 112.
1. and 119. 1. and 128. 1. Etsi videantur ignatis miseri, tamen non possunt
aliud esse quam beati. Saluian. de prouid. l. 1. ^. 2.
Every holy man is an happy man, every godly man is in a blessed estate, be he
rich or poor, be he in wealth or in want, whatsoever his worldly estate
outwardly be. So that of true Godliness, we may well say, as he sometime of
divine knowledge, the ground of it, it is not earthly gain, nor worldly
wealth, nor gold, nor silver, nor corruptible treasures, but Die t^ista
nescire, sed nosse quomodo etiam sine istis hom^ possit esse beatus. Aug opist.
56.
it is that that that can make a man happy without all these. And the Godly
man, though he have not these or the like, yet has he that that can make him
truly happy without them, and so consequently that can give him contentment in
the want of them. And certainly if God be (...) Genes. 17. 1.
El-shaddai, All-sufficient; then (...) 2. Cor. 12. 9.
Gods grace and Godliness that brings a man home unto God, and gives him
interest in God, can not but be likewise of it self sufficient to make a man
truly happy, and to procure unto him true Contentment.

But will we see yet more particularly by what means Godliness works this
Contentment in those that are truly* possessed of it?

First, Act. 15. 9. and 26. 18.
it purges the heart of him that has it: e (...) Socrates, ex Aristonymi
^^marijs Stob. c. 92. Sin^erum est nisi vas, quodcunque infundis, acescit*
Horat. epist. 2. lib. 1.
and so brings with it a sanctified use of the creature. For unless the
vessel be seasoned, it tainteth all that comes into it; and how can ought
taste well then, that comes out of it? So Hagg. 2. 14* 15. V^se f^^ido, vel
oleum, vel vinum facile corrumpitur. Ambr. ep. 3.
unless a man's heart be seasoned with grace, it pollu^eth and de^ileth all
that a man deals with. Tit. 1. 15.
Unto the pure, says the Apostle, all things are pure, but unto the impure and
the vnbelee^ing all things are impure, because their minds and consciences are
defiled. Since the worldly man then does but moile and soil and defile
himself with his wealth, does but taint and pollute it, and himself in the
use of it, no marvel, if he find no comfort or contentment at all in it.

Nothing is pure to them, says the Apostle, because their heart is impure.
Quid relliquiest quin habeat, quae quidem in homine dicuntur bona? Parents,
patriam incolumem, amices, genus, cognatos, diuitias? Atqui haec perinde sunt,

As a foul stomach, stuffed with Choler, turns all into Choler, even the
finest and daintiest meats soonest of any, by means whereof no good
nourishment can accrue to the body by them, nor it grow to any good plight and
health: So a foul heart turns all into spiritual Choler, a bitter humor and
unsavory, that impaireth and hinders the health and welfare of the soul as
much, yea much more than that material choler does the health and welfare of
the body.

Whereas Godliness sanctifying and cleansing the heart, and purging out that
corruption that before tainted and polluted it, and so made all uncomfortable,
because noisome and hurtful, unto us, restores unto us 1. Cor. 7. 14. 1. Tim.
4 4.
a pure and sanctified use of the creature, and enableth us to suck spiritual
nourishment and wholesome juice even out of temporal blessings; which the
soul begins now to find sweet comfort and true contentment in, because it
uses them as it ought.

Secondly, it quieteth the Conscience; which in the wicked, in the worldly man
is ever unquiet; and no true Contentment can be till it be quieted.

Job. 15. 20.
The wicked man is continually like a woman in travail, says Eliphaz. Etiamsi

the wicked man's soul, as the Prophet compares it, is as a raging Sea, full

A seeming truce they may have, true tranquillity they cannot have: Contra

tulit, P. Sir.
Secure they may seem; but they can never be safe. If at some time they seem
to have rest, and to be at ease; it is but as with the Sea, that seems still
sometime, but indeed never stands still, but is ever rising or falling,
ebbing or flowing, incessantly rolling to and fro from shore to shore: It is as
with the Sea, Noli huic tranquillitati confidere. m^m^^to temporis m^^^
^^^^titur; and ^^d^m die vbi luserunt navigia, sorbentur* Sen. epist. 4.
that seems calm and smooth sometime, but upon every breath of air or blast
of wind, is ready to rise and to rage, yea upon some sudden gust sometime
swells so, that ships are there swallowed up suddenly, where they lay
becalmed but a little before. Their seeming tranquillity is but as the health
of a feverous person when he is out of his fit, or the lightsomnes of a
Lunatic that has his lucida intervalla, and talks by times as a man well in
his wits.

Now what Contentment can there be in ought, while the mind is thus affected,
while the Conscience is unquieted? (...) Plut. de tranquil.
So long as a man is heart-sick, he can have no joy of ought, find no relish
in ought, be it never so pleasant and delightful otherwise, be it never so
acceptable to him at other times; his wonted company is then but tedious and
troublesome to him, his bed hard and uneasy, his chamber too close, his usual
fare, yea or fare more dainty than usual, is distasteful, he finds no good
taste in ought that he takes: but (...). Plut. ^ valeat possessor oportet, Qui

come health once, and that sweetneth all again; and then likes he his
company well again, and can endure his bed well, and can feed sauourly on a
dry piece of course bread, that loathed his panada of fine manchet before. Qui

In like manner here: So long as a man is soule-sick, he can have no joy of
ought; be his outward estate what it will, it can no more minister sound
comfort unto him, (...). Plut. de virt and vit.
then hot cloths or blanckets can give inward warmth to a dead corpse, where
natural heat is utterly extinct: He may force himself sometime to some
seeming mirth; but, Prou. 14. 13.

He may set a good face on it in outward show to others, when his heart is full
of heaviness and bitterness within him, and Calceus iste non^e vobis concinnus

where none is aware of it but himself only that sustaineth and endures it.

And undoubtedly, let a man strive to smother it and smooth it over all that
ever he can, let him strain himself to lightsomnes by all means that may be,
let him want no outward matter of worldly either support or delight, yet so
long as he has his guilty Conscience racking and griping him within; though

he may geere and grin outwardly, while he is nipped and galled inwardly, he
can take no more true joy and delight, can find no more sound comfort and
contentment in all his wealth and his treasures, or in his delights and his
pleasures, than (...) Plut. de sera vindict.
a prisoner or condemned person, that sits drinking and swilling, or playing
at cards and tables in the laile, while the halter that he is to be hanged
withal, hangs over his head.

But on the other side, to a quiet mind, to a good Conscience, any thing is
acceptable, yea and comfortable, as to him that is now in health. Let the mind
be truly settled, let the Conscience be once quieted; and the same man that
before took no joy at all in a large estate, found no relish at all in great
variety of dainties, walked melancholic to and fro in his gardens of
pleasure, had no comfort of friends and acquaintance, or of wife and children,
can now find much sweetness in a far poorer pitance, give God hearty thanks
for an homely repast, walk cheerfully abroad, live comfortably at home,
rejoice with his wife, be merry with his friends, be comforted in his children.
And this quietness of mind and Conscience can nothing procure but sincere
Godliness. Which therefore, as it gives true ease, and works sound cure of
those inward gripes and galls, not by benumming of a guilty Conseience, nor 1.
Tim. 4. 2.
searing it, and making it stupid and senseles, as for a time it is sometime in
the wicked; but by removing the ground of them, Romans 5. 1, 2, 3.
by giving a man assurance of the remission of his sin, and of reconcilement
unto God, and so freeth a man from that inward disquiet of mind, that banished
and kept out all true comfort and contentment before; so it brings with it a
sweet and comfortable use of all Gods good creatures; which a man now enjoys
Psalm. 41. 11.
as fruits of Gods love, as effects of Gods favor, and Non tam done quam abs
te datu^: non tam munere, quam abs te missum. Id ^^re triumphat ser^o. Terent.
Eunuch.
in that regard more delightful than the things themselves in themselves are,
as a present sent a man from his Prince.

Thirdly, it brings with it assurance of a greater benefit than all the world
is able to counteruaile; to wit, of Gods favor, and of his fatherly love
toward a man in Christ.

It is the most heavy and the most uncomfortable thing that can be for a man to
be forth of Gods favor. Prove. 19 12. and 20. 2.
The wrath of a King, says Solomon, is as the roaring of a Lion; Prove. 16. 14.
as the messengers of the Death. And what is the wrath of him then, Psalm. 18.
7. and 104. 32.
whose angry look alone is able to shake heaven and earth? And if Ester. 7. 6,
7.
Haman had little joy of all his wealth and his treasures, when Assuerus frowned
on him, when he was fallen forth of his favor; no marvel if a man have no
joy of ought, find no comfort or contentment in ought, so long as God frowneth
on him, so long as he is displeased with him, while the black clouds of Gods
heavy Ioh. 3. 18, 36.
wrath hang over his head?

And on the other side, by Contrarlorum eadem est ratio.
the law of Contraries, as Gods wrath is most hideous, so his love and favor
is most gracious. As there is nothing more discomfortable than the one; so
there is nothing more comfortable than the other. Psalm. 30. 5.
In thy favor, says David, there is life. Yea, Psalm 63 3.
Thy loving kindness, it is better than life. Matthew. 6. 25.
The body is better than raiment, and life of more worth than meat that
maintains life, says our Savior. And, Job. 2. 4.
All that a man has, as the Devil sometime said, will a man give for his
life. But Gods favor and the assurance of it is a greater blessing than life
it self, and much more then greater then any worldly wealth, that is not at
all truly desirable, but as an help and prop to this present life: Able
therefore alone of it self to stay and support a man, to comfort and cheer up
a man, to give him true contentment, Quid hac Jobi miseria miserius? quid tamen
hac infaelicitate felicius? perdiderat oi^a qu^ dederat Deus: sed habuit ip su^

to make him an happy man, in the want of all worldly wealth, though he have
nothing else but it.

iron coin began to grow out of request, after that gold and silver once came
in use. So when a man has once found the favor and love of God in Christ,
has lighted once on it, and got assurance of it, he cease then to be greedy
of this worldly trash, that is in regard of it but as dross or peble stones to
Gold and Diamonds, as maste to the best bread-corne, yea rather of far less
worth and value to that, than either of these are to it.

To which purpose David says, that whereas the worldly man's song is, Psalm. 4.
6.
who will show us any good, who will tell us of any matter of profit? his wish
or request rather was, (with other the Godly) Lord lift thou the light of thy
face, or thy favor, on us. For that Psalm. 4. 7.
he had found more true joy and contentment in the assurance of Gods love, in
the view of his loving countenance toward him, then they had or could reap
comfort by their worldly commodities, their corn and their wine, wherein their
wealth chiefly consisted, though they came in never so plentifully upon them.
Psalm. 4. 8. and 27. 1. and 3. 5.
There was sound rest and assurance of safety by the one, no security in, or
surety at all of the other.

Lastly; In that Socrates ab ^rchelao ad facultates ampli^res accersitus,
(...), inquit, (...) Arrian^ in protrept. apud Stob. c. 95.
it fitteth a man's mind to his means, while it assures him both for the time
present, that that estate, whatsoever it be, that he is then in, is the best
and fittest for him; and for the time to come, that God will continually
provide for him, and never see or suffer him to want ought that he shall stand
in need of.

Heb. 13. 5. 6.
Let your conversation, says the Apostle, be without covetousness; and be
Content with what you have. For God has promised that Genesis 28. 15. Josh. 1. 5.
he will never leave nor forsake you. So that you may boldly say, as the
Psalmist, Psalm. 27. 1.
The Lord is my protector, I need fear nothing; so, Psalm. 23. 1.
The Lord is my Shepherd, I am sure to lack nothing. For Math. 6. 33.
who so seeks Gods Kingdom and the righteousness thereof, shall be sure to
have all other things cast upon him, that may be for his good, he shall have
the one as an ouer-plus in to the other.

It is a great stay of mind to a man for himself or his son, if the King
shall say to him, as David 2. Sam. 9. 7.
to Mephibosheth, or 2. Sam. 19. 38.
to Barzillai the Gileadite, I will see that thou, or he shall never want, or,
you shall neither of you ever want, if I may help it: What a stay of mind
must it needs be to the Godly man then, when the King of heaven and earth shall
say as much unto him, Psalm. 146. 3, 4, 5, 6.
he that is able to make his word good at will, and Hebr. 7. 25.
lives for ever to perform whatsoever he has promised?

Again, the Godly may say it, and assure himself of it, that whatsoever
estate he is in, that estate for the present God sees to be best and fittest
for him. Quaremulta bonis viris aduersa eveniunt? nihil accidero bono viro mali
potest, non miscentur contraria. Sen. de* provid. cap. 2.
If he be poor, poverty is best for him, or else he should not so be: if he
be sick, sickness is best for him then, otherwise God would not suffer him to
keep his sickbed: if in prison, restraint of liberty is then fittest for him,
otherwise the prison should no more be able to hold him, then Act. 5. 23, 19.
and 12. 6, 7.
it was to hold ^eter, when the doors were fast locked on him, and a guard of
soldiers set to keep him sure. If riches were good for him, he should be sure
to have them: if health were good for him, he should be sure not to want it: if
liberty, Psalm. 118. 5.
God without delay would enlarge him and restore it. Psalm. 34. 9, 10.
For there shall nothing be wanting to those that fear God: The Lions shall
lack and suffer hunger; but those that seek the Lord, shall want nothing that
is good. Psalm. 84. 11.
God their Sun and Shield will give them grace and glory: and no good thing
will he, (...) Genesis 17. 1. and 15. 1.
who is God all-sufficient, deny unto them, that walk uprightly before him.

Mark the Apostles argument, that he uses for the proof of this point: Romans
8. 32. Qui misit vn^ge^itum, immisit spiritum, promisit vultum: quid tande^
tibi negaturus est? B^rn. de temp. Nihil vnquam ei negasse credendum est, quem
ad vituli hortatur esum. Hieron. ad Damas. de Luc. 15. 31. (...); Chrysostom, in
Romans ^^. 15.
He that spared not his Son, but bestowed him upon us, how can he but give us
all things together with him. And conceive we the force of it by this
comparison: Suppose a man have a friend, who having but one precious Jewel of
great price, that he makes special reckoning of, is content to part with it,
and bestow it on him for the ransoming and redeeming of him out of captivity:
he is content again, when he is sick, to be at any charge with him for
Physician and Physic; and yet when he is in the fit of a burning Fever, he
will not by any means suffer him to have a cup of cold water. May not such a
one in this case reason thus with himself? Surely, if it were good and safe
for me, yea were it not certainly dangerous and prejudicial unto me to drink
such cold and raw drink, this my friend that thinks nothing too good or to
dear for me that may do me good, that is content to be at all this cost and
charge with me for Physic, would never deny me a cup of cold water that
stands him in nothing. And consequently, if he be wise, he will strive
against his own desire of it, and bend himself patiently to endure the want
and denial of it, as done in wisdom by his friend, and out of a tender regard
of his good. And in like manner does the Apostle teach the Godly man to reason:
God, that having but 1. Petr. 1. 18, 19.
one precious Jewel, to speak of, Ioh. 3. 16.
his own Son and his only Son, was content to bestow him upon me, to shed
his heart-bloud for the saving 1. Ioh. 4. 9.
of my soul, if he saw health or wealth to be good for me, he would never
deny it me, Hagg 2. 9. 1 Chr. 29. 11, 12.
being no more than as a crum of bread or a drop of water with him. So that so
long as he with *holds it, I know well that it is better for me to want it
than to have it; and therefore (...); ^usus apud Arrianu^ dissert l^^ c. 1.
(...). l 2. c. ^6.
I will endeavor to keep my self quiet, and rest content with the want of that,
which I want for my good.

This Godliness persuades every Christian unto; and this Godliness enabled
the same Apostle to do: Philip 4. 11, 12, 13.
I have learned, says he, Magnus ille est qui fictilibus sic vtitur
quemadmodu^ argento* nec ille minor est qui sic arge^to vtitur, quemadmodum
fictilibus. infirmi animi est pati non posse divitias Sen. epist. 5.
to abound: and I have learned to be in want. (Taught it a man must be, ere he
can attain to it; and it is a lesson, that is not easily learned.) (...).
Georg. Pisid. de va^it. vitae.
I have learned to be hungry; and I have learned to be full. (The one had need
to be learned as well as the other: and till a man have learned it, he shall
never be filled.) I have learned in whatsoever estate I am, therewith to be
content. I am able to do all things, yet Ille fortis est, qui non in se, sed in
Deo fortis est. Aug. in Psalm. 31. Bonus vir sine Deo nemo est. an potest
aliquis sapra fortuna^ nisi ab illo adintus exurgere? ille dat consilia
magnifica and erecta. In vnoquoque bonorum virorum, qui Deus, ineertum est,

not of mine own strength, but through the power of Christ enabling me. And so
pass we to the third Point, that at first we propounded, to wit hat true
Contentment is an undoubted argument of Godliness.

A Contented mind argues a religious heart; and a discontented mind argues
an irreligious spirit. It is a sign that a man sees not Gods goodness,
considers not his own unworthiness, when he is ever murmuring and repining,
misliking and finding fault with his own estate, and envying those that be
above him. So that where discontent, meant is lodged in the heart, there is
Godliness excluded and shut out of doors. And hereby may a man know himself
to be truly religious, if he have a mind contented ever with his present
estate: not Feras, non culpes, quod vitari no^ potest. P. Syrus. Optimum est
pati quod emendare non possis. Sen. epist. 107. ^ leve fi^ patientia, Quicquid
corrigere est nefas. Hor. carm. 1. 24.
barely because he can not mend the matter, or ease himself by being
discontent at it; (that is a kind Affectio humana caninae aequanimitatis
stupore firmata. Tertull. de patient.
of doggish stupiditie, rather than Christian aequanimitie, as one well says:)
but because Psalm. 39. 9. and 119. 75. Deu^ quo authore cuncta proveniunt, sine
murmuratione sequi. Se^. ep. 107. Quicquid inciderit, non tanquam malum
aspernabitur, and in se casu delatum, sed quasi (a Deo) delegatum sibi (lubens

to rest content with whatsoever he does; whom he knows Esai. 39. 8.
to do nothing but good, and Ps. 119. 71, 67.
to do all things for his good: that which is true piety, and a good note of
sincerity wheresoever it is found.

But here every man will be ready to say, that he may seem religious, that he
is well content with his estate, and thanketh God for it with Job 1 21.
Job, whatsoever it be. Well; if it be so, as Saint James says, Iam. 2. 18.
Show me thy faith by thy works: so let us Aequanimitas vestra nota sit.
Philip. 4. 5.
show our Contentment by the effects, by the fruits of it.

Of a Note or two of Contentment then a word or two, and so an end.

One sign of Contentment then is, the use of lawful means only; When a man
desires not, nor endeavors to better his estate by indirect and
unwarrantable courses: when a man does Psalm. 37. 1, 8. and 73. 12, 13.
not fret to see wicked men rise by bad means, nor is sorry that he may not do
as they do: much less is moved to do wickedly, and to take such courses as he
sees wicked ones thrive withal, while himself and other godly, as himself
seems to observe, either decay, or else stand at a stay.

Genesis 14. 23.
Abraham, when the King of Sodom offered him some part of his spoils, refused
to take so much as a shoe-latchet of him, that the King of Sodom might not say
that he had made Abraham rich; that men might not say, that Abraham had bin
made rich, not by Gods blessing, but by the Kings means; he might thank the
King of Sodom for his wealth. So a Godly man will not gain, nor desire to
gain so much as a shoe-string or shoe-thred by profaning Gods Sabbaths with
N^hem. 13. 16.
the Zidonian Merchants, by fraud or deceit, by oppression and extortion, by
biting usury, the Devils brokery, or by any other unlawful and indirect
course; that the Devil may not say, that, he has made him rich; as he said
sometime to our Savior, Matthew. 4. 9.
All this will I give thee, if thou will fall down and worship me. For Illas
tibi divitias Diabolus dat, quas per furtum, quas per fraudem acquiris. Operis
imperf. apud Chrysostom. hom. 5.
it is of the Devils gift all that is gotten by such means, that is compassed
by such courses: and he has neither a contented mind, nor a religious heart,
that will seek or take ought at the Devils hand.

As the Number. 9. 22, 23.
Israelites therefore travailing through the wilderness toward the land of
promise, (which, to have gone the next way, had not bin a journey of many
days, yet were they many years about) they were to go as God led them, as
they saw the Cloud go before them, and not to take that way that seemed best or
most compendious in their own eyes. So must we Obseruare vias Domini. Ps 18.

107.
observe Gods ways in our trading and trafficking, in our walking toward
wealth: we must keep the way that God leads us; go no other way than we can
see him going in before us, follow the line of his law, though it seem to lead
us in and out, backward and forward, as if we were treading of a maze; and not
take those ways, leaving the guidance of it, that seem gainer and nearer in
our own eyes, and much more compendious than the other. Though we might
compass wealth with a word or two, with the bow of a knee only the one way,
whereas we must travail, and toil and moile much ere we come by it the other
way: tho we might attain to it within a day, or a week, the one way, whereas
we are like to stay long, many years, it may be, ere we come at it, the other
way: yet this way must we keep, and Math. 4. 10.
refuse all the world with our Savior, if it be offered us to entice us out of
it.

Otherwise as the Number. 14. 44, 45.
Israelites, when they went out of Gods precincts, they went withal out of
Gods protection, and so fell before their foes, into whose hands they fell,
forsaking Gods shelter and sauegard. So Qui properat di^es^^re. Pro. 28. 20,
22. (...) Menand. Nam dives qui fieri vult, Et cito vult fieri: sed quae
reuerenita legum, Quis metus aut pudor est vnqua^ properantis auari. Iuve^.
sat. 11.
those that make more haste then good speed to be rich, that balke Gods paths,
and step aside out of Gods way, to compass wealth, shall undoubtedly come to
evil. For Qui volunt ditari. 1. Tim. 6. 9 No^ ait, qui sunt, sed qui fieri
volunt. B^rn. de diverse. 36. Qui volunt, no^ qui sunt. cupiditates accusat, no^
facultates. Aug. hom. 13. and de temp. 205. Qui augere opes ambit, vitare
peccatu^ negligit, and more aviu^ dum escam terrenarum rerum auide conspicit,
quo stra^guletur peccati laqueo non agnoscit. Greg. pastor. lib. 3. cap. 1. 21.
those that will be rich, says the Apostle, that set this down, Vnde habeas,
quaerit nemo; sed oportet habere. Iuuenal. sat. 14.
rich they will be, howsoever they come by it, per fas and nefas, by hook or
crook, as we say, by right or by wrong, they pierce their hearts through with
many sorrows, pester their minds with many fond and noisome lusts and
desires, and plunge themselves into many dangerous snares, that at length
drown their souls in destruction.

Yea the very desire of bettring a man's estate by such means, is an evident
argument of discontent: when it grieueth a man at the heart, that his
conscience will not give him leave, or that Gods law will notsuffer him to use
those means that he sees worldly men grow wealthy withal. Malus miles est,
qui Imperatorem gemens sequitur. Sen. epist. 107. and de vita beata cap. 15.
(...) Arrian. dissert. l. 2. cap. 16.
He is out of Gods way, though he seem to be yet in it, though he stride not
outwardly out of it, that misliketh it, that likes any other way better than
it, that walks in it with an evil will. And Malu^ opus non est factu^ nisi
ab ijs qui ia^ mali erant. Aug. de civit Dei l. 14. c. 13.
as Adam and Eve sinned and were evil even in desiring to eat, before ever
they tasted of the forbidden fruit: So the very desire of liberty for such
courses argues evidently so far forth a mind irreligious, though the heart
never consent to put them in practice.

A second Sign of a Contented mind is the use of such lawful means without
Care and Couetise, without distrustful care, without greedy desire.

It is the saying of some of the Ancients, and it is a true saying, that (...)
Alex. paed. l. 2. c. 10. Adulter est in sua^ vxorem amator ardentior. Xystus
Pythag in sentent. Iu aliena vxore omnis amor turpis est; in sua nimius.

contra Julian. l 2. Libido appetitus est sine iudicio, sine modo, vt si vxorem
amem amore meret^icio. Jul. S^al. de subtle. exerc. 317. 2.
A man may commit adultery with his own wife: So a man may commit spiritual
fornication with the lawful means, that he uses and lawfully may use, if he
use them in unlawful manner. For the preventing and avoiding whereof our
Savior Christ bids us, Math. 6. 25.
Take no care, (or, no thought rather, if you will) what we shall eat or
drink, or wherewith we shall be clad. In which precept, or prohibition rather,
he forbids not the use of lawful means, but the distrustful affection in
the use of those means. Which appears both by some of the instances that
there he makes use of, as that Math. 6. 26.
of the fowls, that yet Math. 24. 28. ex Job 39. 31, 32. Legatur Aug. de oper.
Monach. c. 22, 23, 24.
labor and fly about for their food and their living, but without
covetousness and care; as also by (...)
the word that he there uses, signifying properly such (...) Eustath. Iliad. d.
a carking care, as even divides the mind in twain, and cutteth the very
soul as it were asunder.

For the better and fuller conceiving hereof, we must know, that there is a
twofold Care: there is (...).
a studious care, and there is (...).
a carking care, which we call commonly a taking of thought: there is cura de
opere, and cura de operis successu; a care for our work it self, and a care
for the success of it, for the issue and event of it. And it is not the
former, but the latter of the two, that is there inhibited.

There is a Care for the work it self, when a man is careful to do his
duty, and to do well that he does, and accordingly does painfully and
faithfully endeavor to effect it the best he can. And thus there is no man more
careful than the child of God, than the Christian man; because Ephesians. 6. 6.
he does of Conscience all he does. There is another Care about the issue and
success of the work, which our Savior Christ calls els-where, (...) Luke
12. 29.
an hanging in suspense, and doubt for the event of it, as the meteors do in
the air, uncertain whither to stay there, or to fall down to the ground.
This is then, when a man is not content to do his best endeavor, but he casts
doubts, and takes thought for what the issue of it will be; he fore thinks
with himself, that if he gain not by such a bargain, he shall be undone; if
such a debtor break or keep not touch with him, he shall be utterly
overthrown; if his grounds take not, or his cattle stand not, he shall not
have bread to put in his belly; if he can not get the favor of such a Judge,
or such a great man, he shall never have any good success in his Law suites,
or, if he be toward the Law, his Counsel will grow out of request. etc.

Conceive it yet further by these two Examples. Mark. 13. 11.
Our Savior forbids his Apostles both (...)
to take care, and (...)
to take thought before hand, when they are to appear before great persons;
both to forecast with themselves what to speak when they come before them,
and to fore-thinke how that they shall speak will be taken when they have
spoken it. Yet the Ministers of the word now a days are (...) vnde meditari.
Lat.
to study before hand what to speak either in Church or Court, if they be
there to appear, because they have it not now ordinarily by immediate instinct
at an instant, as Math. 10 9.
they then had: But they are not (...)
to take thought how their speeches will speed, but leave the issue of it to
Gods good will.

Again, Math. 28 13, 14.
the Priests bid the Soldiers say, that CHRIST'S corpse was stolen away by night
while they slept, and promise withal (...)
to secure them, or so to save them harmless, that they shall not need to
take further care in that kind. The Soldiers were yet to plot and devise how
to tell their Tale so, as it might carry most show of truth with it, and having
so done, they were to rely on the Priests credit for the rest, who had given
them their word before for the issue of it, that it should no way prove
prejudicial or jeapordous to them. In like manner it is our part to take care
how to perform those offices and duties that God has called us unto in the
best manner that we may: but for the success of it, when we have performed our
part, and done our duty and our endeavor, we must, as the Apostle wills us,
(...). Philip. 4. 6.
be wholly secure or careless; take no thought for ought, but leave all to God,
and rely wholly upon him, who has commanded us 1 Pet. 5. 7
to cast (...)
all our care in this kind upon him, and promised withal that he will take
this care for us.

This distrustful care breeds that 1. Tim. 6. 10. (...) Bio^ apud Stob. c.
10. (...) Clem. Alex padag. l. 2. c. 3. Auiditas materia malorum omnium Amm^an.
hist. lib. 31. parens. Latus Mauritio. Sicut radi^ bonoru^ omnium est charitas,
ita malorum omnium cupiditas. Aug. hom. 8.
Covetousness that is the Root of all evil. Not amiss termed the Root, as
some well have observed: because as there is life often in the root, when there
is no sap in the branches: so this vice often lives, when other die and decay.
For Libidinis ignis paulatim extinguitur, and cum senecture consenescit: at
avaritia augescit continuo, and cum senectute iuvenescit, quando vitia reliqua
consen^scu^t. Rolloc. ad 1. Tim. 6.
even old men, Auaritia senilis quid sibi velit non intelligo. potest eni^

Cic. de senect. Mirabilis sane dementia (...) vnim samptibus se o^^rare
fastinat, cu^ iam par(...)quo tendebat, Aug. de temp. 246.
against reason, that have least time to live, are oft-times most careful for,
most covetous of the things of this life: they think, though they have never
so much, that unless they gather still more, they shall want or starve yet ere
they die; they shall not have meat, says one, to put in their mouths while
they live, nor money to bury them with when they be dead.

But neither will such Philip. 4. 5, 6.
Carefulnes, or such Hebr. 13. 5.
Covetousness stand with Contentment: and therefore must be both far from us, if
we would be accounted truly religious. We must banish all such distrustful
thoughts, we must abandon all such greedy desires. We must learn, as Matthew. 6.
12.
we pray but for daily bread; so to rest content with it when we have it; yea
to rest content too, when we have it not, with the want of it. We must learn,
when we have done our best endeavor, to leave the issue and event of our labors
to God. As Ioab says to his soldiers; 2. Sam 10. 12.
Let d (...) Plut. de ov^r.
us be of good courage, and fight valiantly for our King and our Country; and
let the Lord then do what seems good in his sight. So must we do what God
has enjoined us to do; and when we have so done, Psalm. 37. 5.
commit our way for the issue of it to him, and rely upon him, and he will
bring it about; he will be sure then to give such issue to it as shall be for
our good.

The third and last Note of Contentment may be Psalm. 13. 7.
Silence before the Sheerer. When God comes to sheere a man of his substance,
of his wealth and his riches, if he have a contented mind, he will not murmur
and repine at it, as Psalm. 106. 25.
the Israelites ever and anon when they wanted Exodus 17. 3.
water, or Exodus 16. 2, 3.
bread, or Number. 11. 4, 5, 6, 7.
flesh in the wilderness: but rather praise God with Job; Job 1 21. Abstulit,
sed and dedit. Sen. epist. 64. (...) Arria^. dissert. l. 1. c. 11. Tulisti
liberos quos ipse dederas. non contristor, quod recepisti, ago gratias quod
dedisti. Hiero^ ad Julian.
God gave it, and God takes it: blessed be Gods name. Vitam reposcen^^
naturae, tanquam debtor bonae fidei, red^^turus exulto. Julian. apud Ammian.
l. 25.
I return my life to Nature requiring it back, said that Apostata, as some
report of him, when he lay a dying, as a faithful debtor, with a good will. So
(...) Epictet. Enchir. Vita data est v^enda, data est sine ^oenore nobis Mutua,
nec certe persoluenda die. Pedo ad Live. Non est quod nos suspiciamus, tanquam
inter nostra positi. mutuo accepimus: (non tam data, quam commodata. Primas. ad

appellatos sine querela reddere. Sen. ad Marc. cap. 10.
should we return God his own again, that he has pleased to lend us, as
faithful and thankful debtors with hearty good will; Non moeremus quod talem
amisimus; sed gratias agimus, quod habuimus. Hieron. epitaph. Pa^^ae.
rendering thanks unto him, that we have had them so long, not repining because
we can have them no longer.

But we contrariwise, when we have had a long time the use of Gods blessings,
are wont to lay claim to them, and to account them as our own by
prescription; and so, P^ssimi est debitoris creditori facere convitium. Sen.
ibid.
as it falls our ofttimes by bad borrowers and worse pay-masters, God loses
a friend with us for asking his own of us.

Psalm. 39. 9.
I was dumb, says David, and opened not my mouth, because it was thy doing.
It is a sign that a man sees Gods hand on him for his good, if he can be
silent when God straitneth and impaireth his estate.

And Hebr. 10. 34.
the faithful Hebrews, says the Apostle, with joy, not quietly only but
cheerfully, sustained the loss of their worldly goods, knowing that they had
better treasure and more durable laid up for them in heaven. It is a sign that
Hebr. 11. 25, 26.
a man looks at a better matter, when he can so readily and so cheerfully
part with his wealth: as Genesis 45. 20.
Jacob regarded not his household stuff and substance in Canaan, when he had
all the fat of Egypt before him.

Shut we up this last point with this familiar similitude. A garment that
hangs loose about a man is put off with ease; but so is not the skin that
sticks fast to the flesh, nor the shirt that cleaves fast to the vlcerous
leper; a tooth if it be loose, it comes out with ease, but if it stick fast
in the head, it is not pulled out but with pain, yea many times it brings
away some piece of the gum or the jaw with it. So here, Tunc vere oftendimus,
quia accepta recte tenuimus, quu^ aequa^imiter ad momentum sublata toleramus
Greg. mor. l. 2. c. 42. Mihi diuitiae si effluxerint, nihil ^uferent nisi
semetipsas: tustup^bis and videboris tibi sine terelictus, si illa a te
recesseri^t. apud me diuitia aliquim locu^ habent; apud t^ summum: ad postremum
divitiae ^easunt, tu diuiti^rum es. Senec. de vita beat. c. 12.
a man is content willingly to part with his riches, when Psalm. 62. 10. Sapiens
divitias non amat, sed mavult: non in animu^ illas, sed in domum recipit.
Senec. ibid. 21. Omnia istae nobis accedant, non hareant: vt si abduca^tur,
sine vlla nostri laceratione discedant. Idem epist. 74.
his heart is not set upon his wealth: but (...). Basil. ad divit. hom. 7.
(...). Hesiod. (...). Antiphanes. (...). Antipho apud Stob. cap. 10. Vip^te
quibus pecu^ia sua ^bhasit, nec sine sensu avelli potest. Sen. de tranquil. c.
8.
if his heart be glewed to it, it even renteth his heart in two to part with
it, it pulls as it were a piece of his soul away with it. And that is the
reason why Job. 1. 21.
Job blessed God, when he took away all that ever he had from him, whereas most
men, if God take from them but a small pitance of that they have, are ready, as
Job. 1. 11.
the Devil untruly said that Job would do, even to curse him to his face.

To conclude then: Would we be esteemed truly Religious? Philip 4. 5.
Let our contentment of mind nota sit omnibus.
appear to the world; in not seeking of these outward things, either by
indirect courses, or with distrustful desire; in patient enduring the want of
them, when God sees good to deny them, and in quiet parting again with them,
when God shall call again for them: Assuring our selves that God does all for
our good, as well in withholding or withdrawing of them from us, as in
conferring them upon us, or in continuing them unto us: So shall we be sure of
a comfortable use of Gods good blessings in this life, and of certain
enjoyment of eternal blessedness together with God himself in the next life.

FINIS.
