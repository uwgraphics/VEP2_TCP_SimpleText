A Mess of good Fellows: OR,
The generous spark who roundly,
does call, and says for his part,
Tush, we have and shall have abundance,
come fill us the other od quart.
To the tune of, Ragged and torn.



WEll met my iouiall blades,
Tom, Anthony, Dick, and James
We have been all merry Comrades,
as all our acquaintance proclaims:
Now since we are all met here,
We Will be merry before we go,
For paying let us never fear,
our credit is good we know.
Here Is 4 or five shillings good round ones
i will spend them before we part,
Tush, we have and shall have abundance
come fill us the other od quart.
We Will laugh and make good sport,
and cry a fig for care,
What though our means grows short,
the world has enough to spare:
When either of us was borne,
we had as much wealth about us
As those that are rich (I Will be sworn)
why then should they ieer and flout us?
and though they have since got ground on's
it does nor much grieve my heart:
Tush, we have etc.
Let Us sing and make a noise,
as best the time befits,
We show our selves merry good boys,
when the world is beside her wits:
The Usurer with all his bags,
is not so content in mind,
As honest good fellows in rags,
that are to each other kind.
Our hearts are all perfect and sound ones,
we scorn from our friends to start,
Tush, we have and shall have abundance;
come fill us the other od quart.
The Mizer does daily plod
how he may his riches increase,
He makes his gold his God,
but we live at better hearts ease:
Let fortune frown or smile,
we do not for that much pass.
The world shall not us beguile,
with her prospectiue glass,
If poverty seek to wound us,
we will cure't with the Uintners art,
Tush, we have etc.
He that does enjoy his health,
and a competent means withal,
What need he to pine for wealth,
but take what to him does befall?
A contented mind is worth gold,
it is but a folly to strive,
We all were at first of one mould,
yet all are not borne to thrive,
Then let no ill thoughts confound us,
let every one bear a good heart,
Tush, we have and shall have abundance,
come fill us the other od quart.
The second part, To the same tune.


WE scorn to spend money on queanes,
though sometimes we hunt the fox,
For he that so wastes his means,
at last will be paid with a p --
No surgeon nor any Physician,
for money their aid shall lend us,
When drinking has changed our condition
a hair o'th old dog will mend us.
Grim sorrow can never wound us,
which makes curmudgeans to smart,
Tush, we have, and shall have abundance,
Come fill us the the other odd quart.
It Is better far to be poor,
and have a contented mind,
Then to have abundance of store,
and with it no rest can find:
The covetous man is not rich,
he never is satisfide,
His money does him bewitch,
he thinks upon nothing beside:
Such puddles shall never drown us,
weel be well content with our part,
Tush, we have etc.
Some idle companions there be,
that rather then they will work,
Upon such good fellows as we,
the Rascals will live by the shirk,
At last they are taken in the nick,
(for cheating can nere come to good)
And then they are taught a fine trick,
to look through a piece of wood:
And oftentimes when they are found thus
with pain they do follow the cart
Tush, we have etc.
He that has a generous mind,
will take any laudable course,
What fortune to him has assignd,
he takes it for better for worse:
And to recreate his senses,
when labor has taken off the edge,
They weigh not a little expenses.
each other like us they will pledge.
Let our hearts be true and sound ones,
tho fortune our meanings does thwart,
Tush, we have, etc.
Such merry vaga^ies weel play,
when liquor has captived our wits,
We think not how hard the next day
we must work for these mad merry fits:
Yet weel neither quarrel nor chide,
as fools in these humors do use,
Such folly we cannot abide,
if any way we can choose.
And if any man seek to wrong us,
weel one take another part.
Tush we have, etc.
But amongst all our merry cheer,
- twere pity of all our lives,
If all the while we are here,
we neglect to drink to our wives.
Faith that was remembered well,
it is better at last then never,
Though my share do the rest excel,
it shall go about howsoever.
Now left too much liquor should drown us
let us know what is oath score and depart,
Tush we have, and shall have abundance,
come give us the other odd quart.
