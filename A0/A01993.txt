IT nedyth him that woll have long list to know the craft of wholesome
gouerneyle. And so for to keep contynuelly the health of his body / for else he
may not com to his naturell end / but he shall dye or his kyndeli time come.
and therefore thus says Galye^ the conning. He says of wholesome governance
is marvelous / for it makes a man to live tylle he be old. and without
sikenes in to the last of his elde and age: Therefore the same Galyen after
that he knew the craft of wholesome gouernaumce. came never into no sikenes^
but seelde / that was in to a fymeram that is to say a sharp fever. and that
was for trauayll in vysityng of his frendys. about the common profit. for thus
he says / I take god to record and his angels assygned to keep me / that who
that wylfully and besily will study in the treatise of holsom governance and
woll keep alhole the doctrine thereof. he shall never dye but on and upon kyndly
death / which death is sweet and soft without great pain as the same Galyen
witnesses in the dyfference of feuerys / But understand that wholesome
governance may no man duly keep that most nedys be occupied will him or nyl
him and may not when him needs leave of. for thy it needs him that he have
that needs him to his life without travail and pencyfull / and in all
thyngys that he be of fre condycyon / Ferthermore it is to wete. that viij.
things at the least ben needful in wholesome gouernayle / of which the first
is a dyscrete chors of thoo things that shall be eten or dronken / The second
is wylfull bodyli exersice to fore mete. and that till the swetyng begin or
namely till his wind change fro sloughe to swyftnes / The third is well
profitable and well nedeful that all that shall be etyn be well and small chewed
/ The fourth is that thou ete while thou have talent to ete. the v. is that
thou sleep on morrow till thou wake be thine own will / For as arystotle says
not only in metys and drynkys be we noryshed and fostred. but also in sleep /
The vj. is that thou take no mete and drynk in sorrow ne in care but in Joye as
much as thou may: The vij. is that thou have ne hold no cold in winter ne
in somer after bloodletynge. The viij. is that thou use saffron in thy mete /
for it quy^neth kyndely hete and comfort thy dygesty on and taryeth thine
elde or age and brings in gladness. and lets thine humors fro rotynge and
driynge

IT is in stories of our elders that on a time a mighty king brought to gyder
three of the best leches that might be of Inde of Mede and of Greece / and he
commanded hem that each of them should study to assygne the best medycyne /
which if a man would use should profit him to help of body and him should
need none other medicine / Truly the leche of Greece assygned and said that every
day a man to take twys his mouth full of hot water / should make a man so
hole that him should need none other medicine and the leche of Mede assygned and
said that it should profit much every day fasting to tak gromel said: And I

What is first on morrow to be done.
AFter that a man has well and p^afible fulfilled his sleep look he rise and
cloth him self with good clothe and sweet if he have them / then he owes to
walk a lytil euenli to stretche out his lymmes and kembe his head for whi
ke^byng draws out the vapors ye common from the stomach to the ^xd in time of
sleep. and therwyth look that ye be besie to put out the superfluytees of the
body. in siegyng pyssyng koughyng and spy^tyng. then look he wesshe his hands
and his face in somer with cold water and in winter with hoote water Then look
he pray and preyse his lord after the doctrine of his law and vysite the
por^ in god. then if it like him he should study or read dyspute or talk and
wise me^nys ^ou^ceyl and seye^g besily here / and in mesure be merry and flee
utterly wrath and sorrow in as much as he may / and use him self mesurable
trauayl as walkyng or ridyng and in clean hihe places fro myer and marrys / for
this profyteth much / for it breketh wind in a ma^nys body and strenghyth and
lyghteth his lymmes and comfort the heete of the stomak and strengyth his
joints / and melts evil humors

Of the body exersice and of his profit.
WE owen to know by auctors of leche craft / that thoo that shall live fair
and well in holsom governance. owen to have even and tempered exersice to fore
mete. for that yeueth to all the body tempered hete even and not passing /
which should a ma^nys exersice be / a fycysion discreuyth thus: Exersice is a
wylfull meuyng by which a mannys wind is made great. and often it needs that
this traueyll be wylful / and not stressyd by need / but that he be all fre and
worche after his oune will / And therefore labor of carpenters and plowmen
masons maryners and such other is none exercise of lechecrafte / for it has
not propely wylfull meuyng / Merchants treuly burgeys cloysterers and such
other walking well and long / but it is not properly exercise of lechecraft /
But when a man walks freli of his oune will / and so swyftly till he begin to
feynt and his wind change / then anon he should sit and rest / for if he
meuyd any further / hit should be pain and feyntes / and such exercise is
cleped tempred / for thereby grouen many goods to ma^nys body. First for there
by is the kyndely hete strenghyd and eched and so ben other iiij. virtues that
is to say. virtue drawing virtue defiynge virtue wythholdyng and virtue out
puttyng / And so ben there v. bodily wits. that is to say / herynge seeng
smellyng tastyng and feeling / and so ben there iij. myndely virtues / that is
to say Imagynatyf dyscretyfe and memoratyfe.

And though error happed in all these worchynges of lechecrafte so it were not
to notable. and exercise were as should be. should never or seelde ma^nys body
need other medicyne / for exerecyse fulfyleth the defautes of all other / For
thy be they merry that dreden bloodletyng and other doutefull medicines / but by
exercise they mowen be heled and sanyd / Metheles ij. things ben needful to
every well exercysed that is to say / that he be not to full ne to em^y / to
full then would the humors lose and so were great dread of the liver or some
fever or sodeyne death / for thy in such a caas look therbe long dyscrete
abstynence so that he be not to empty / for then should his body be feeble out^
of mesure / and at the last for febelnes it most nedys lose. Therefore who that
is to empty it needs that he labor not till he be more and better releued /
Truly aucturs sayen that exercise is one of the hihest and nobelest thing that
may be done of to ma^nys body and full needful it is in gouernayll of health
and leng thing of life for why exercise fulfylleth the medycynes of bloodes and
bathynges and such other things / and therein is no dread nor bytternes ne
exspences / but therein is pure recreacyon of body and of soul so it be done
in clean places / and then should men show hem self to the clean eyer and
delight in seeng far and nere. water and land heaven and earth grene and falow
/ And in all these he should praise and worship our lord god. Fulgens
dyscryueth exercise in a full faye manner thus seyeng / exercise is true keeping
of ma^nys life and prick of kind slepynge / and the fylthe of foul color and
trendyng of slothes hete and wastyng of superfluytes / and saddynge of lymmes
and sleeng of siknesses / and dryuynge a way of vices medycyne of langores /
wynnyng of time / and debt of youth / and Joy of elde of age / and help of
health / enmye of idelnes. and dystroyeng of all evil: But among all other
things it is to wete that exercise mesured meserably heteth a ma^nys blood
and dries it / And therefore mesurable fleumatyk men should use it / and rest
coleth a man and moysteth him / and that is good for coleryk men / for thy he
alone draws him self from exercise that would fayn fail Iope and felicyte /
in this life: Galyen says that great pu^gacyons and vomytes should not be taken
bu^selden and for great need for why / Who so woll each month ones or twyes
greatly purge him self he shall bring his body to man^ evil uses / for he
shall engendre therein man^ noyous humors / For why each day exercise is full
needful to keep a ma^nys health / for who that eteth or drynketh much may not
be hole but if he woll somewhat sleep and swynke. Then these things that be
said it shows that mesured exercise has many profytes for it styreth the
kyndly hete and opens the poores / and losith cold / and thyck towgh humors
/ And whenne they ben losed bears hem out at the poores / and makes a ma^nys
joints slypper and light / and it comfort all the members of a ma^nys
body: Wherefore noi^us humors ben more holsomly purged and mesured by exercise
then by laxatyues or vomytees / for another of them may be without empeyreme^t
of kind / and right as due keeping of kyndely exercise is needful / so other
while is rest: For why rest in as much as it is contrary to exercise / some
is bodily some is ghostly / of which each either if it be mesured after that
kind would it is heleful both to the body and soul / and if it be not so it
is contrary: For whi if rest be to much it gendreth norysheth and multyplyeth
evil humors and increases much corupcyon / For why when water rests to
much it stynketh. so iron and each metal rustyth when it restyth:

The spyces of exercise /
SPyces of exercise ben there well many as there be diverse statys of persons
some be strong and some be feeble some rich and some pore some prelates and at
the large and some subgettes and enclosed. And sometime weder is fair and clear
/ and sometime not so but derke and reyn / And therefore it needs to have spyces
of exercise / for whithe best spyce and the first is to walk to fore mete in
hihe places and clean / Another spyce is to ride and y^ is for rich men / but
great prelates most have other manners of exercise / for whi in chamber shall
be a great c^rde knytted in the end and hanged up. and take that cord with
both hands and stand vpryght so that thou touch not the erche and stand a
good while / then run as much as thou may heder and theder with that
cord / and otherwhile skyppe / and if this please the not / ^ane a stone of
xxx. li. weyghte or theraboute and if thou wolt have health therein often bear
that ston fro that on side of that house to that other side or a long while
hold up that ston or thou let it down or bear it a bonte thy neck or between
thy hands / and so of other manners till thou feynt or thus hold a staff in
thy ^hand and let a another take hit from the if he may with even draughte /
or thus close a penny in thyn hand and let a another take it if he may or thus
hold thy breath as long as thou may and then puff it out as hard as thou
may do / And this manner of exercise is full profitable to put out noyos
superfluytees / for why many superfluytees in sleep ben wythholden therefore if
thou have non other manner of exercise holdyng of breath helps it much / Yet
there ben other manners of exercise for young men that been lusty as to run to
wrestle to lepe to cast the stone / and so of other plays also tempred
fleshly companyng with a yo^g broun woman is good in winter / and with a young
white woman is good in somer is also good and helpyng in gouernyng of health
to body but not to soul / except to hem then that mowen have it by gods
laws so netheles that thee be so much tym between that he feel him selse
eased and lyghtened in his body and that he ete the better and sleep the
better: But therwyth understand that as much as helpyth tempred companyenge^
so much noyeth dystempred co^panye^g / and namely to much for it coleth him
wastes him and fills him For why ma^nys kind is made of the best blood
and best defied / that hastily may torn into ma^nys lymmes: And for whi
whenne a man casts out that noble humors to much he is hugely dyscolored
and his body much febled more then he let four sithes so much blood out
of his body / also who that much deleth or co^panyeth fbesly with a woman
lightly kacheth ye palsy with more evil:

How a man should have him in etyng:
WHen a man has well exercysed him as it is said to fore. rest awhile after
and then a lityl fresh whete bread well baked and somdel soured. then drynk
adraught of good clear wine or other good sauery drink: then rest a while
after and study in some wise means then have some solace and myrthes with thy
friend and with other honest company / Then against even take thy mete and
supper most sauorly but if thy costome be there age in: But a generalle rule
of all fysik and leches is that thine hour of etyng be when thou art kyndly
hunryg / and to fore thyn hunger ete not / but if it be a lityll mess of good
and clean warm mete / to provoke thyn appetyte with and when thou have
appetyte let not / for as a fycysion seyth the stomak out of use to suffer
hunger. fulfylleth the body of roten humors And then woll a ma^nys body wexe
full of noughty humors / by cause that the colere is drawn to the mouth of the
stomak / so that afterward when he would ete he may not: Ferthermore it is to
wit that no man should ete but he knew certainly his stomak void of that
thing that he ete tofore. and that shall a man know by desire that he has to
ete / and by ple^te of spyttyng coming up to his mouth. For whi who that eteth
without desire his mete shall find the kyndly hete of his stomak cold / and
he that eteth with desire he shall find the kyndely hete of stomach give up a
smell and sauoure like encense / but thise and shuche other should be
understood of hem that have mete ordained at her own will / and who y^ that
not ete when he may have it for they ben not bounden to the laws of this
crafteli dyatore as to the qualytees of thy metes. understood that thilke mete
which that most governs thyn health should not be passing in any qualite: for
whi the metes that been to hot bre^ne^ the blood / as peper ga^lek oynyo^s
cresses sa^ge myntes persile and such other. and tho metes that been to ^^ld
fresyn the blood. as letuse pursila^ gourdes and such other / And if thy metes
ben to watery then they (...) thy blood / as be melons and co^combres. and if
thy metes ben to dry it throwith out thyn vytayll virtues and if thy metes
be^ to fat they let thy dygestio^ and if thy metes ben to sweet. they stoppe^
the and make^ the constypat and costyff. and thy metes ben bitter they utterly
noryshen the not: And if thy metes be to salt they bre^nen noye^ and breken
thy stomak / and if thy metes ben to sour they maken the sone old: For thy
non of thise metes much and contynuelly used is good to health of mannys body
/ but only that mete is good that is tempored and wantyth to mykilnesse / as
ben these good metes for health of ma^nys body and holsom / lamb of on year
young kyddes soukyng calves he^nys capons chekyns pertryches ploueres fesau^tes
small birds of the feeld and of the wood / but not of the water / And when
the season comyth yo^ge rabettes. and pigs feet ben good and other
extremities as groye^ and eres and scaled fyshe of clean rennyng water. Year
eyren or eggis Also borage langdebuff whete bred well bake and / well leuyned
and somdele saltyd of that that is one day old or tweyn / and of other that been not to much passing in any qualyte and if we drede^ excess of any qualite
amend it by the contrary thereof. an ensample. if thou be seek of evil and
toughe metes use therefore sharp metes and short / as a lityll of hard chese
skraped small. and of lityll quantyte / and also a pere or two or three of the
most best fruit to thy complexion and nature: Sothly salt metes sour and
bitter may be amended with sweet appuls / sweet metes be^ amended with sweet
honey and good old wine / and so of all other. and if thou wolte ete fruit ete
hem fast as cherise grapes and almondes / and after mete a few peers quynces
and nottes / a few while they be^ grene and walnottes ben best. but let the
skyn be clean pyked away fro the mete: Also the complexion of a man should be
looked to as if he be tempred keep him so with like metis and drynkys / and if
it be dystempered by his contrare bring it lityll and lytil aye^ to tempre /
and f^r whi to sangweyn men dystempred give malincoliouse metes. and to
malencolyouse men sangueyen metes / and to flewmatyk men coleryk metes / for
every evil complexion may be brought to temprure / but if necessaryes of
lyuebode let it: And know when thou wol^e and note it for a souerayye
notabylite / who y^ etyth often milk and fyshe / often katchen thereof a lepre or
a white skabbe. Also often to use wine as great and hihe mighty or hihe colored
and milk to gyder brings a man to both lepre and skab. here none suffysyth
of qualyte of metes / as to the quantyte understand that thy mete ne thy
drink should be no more but as thy kyndely health might ouercom it else thy
body shall waste and thy virtues wexe feeble And for the qua^tyte of metes
drynkes may not certainly be showed look how thou felyst it has done the most
good and such quantyte use. Furdermore understand that no man should ete
anon after his exercise ne anon after he were bathed / but fryste rest him a
while so that he hungre / and then when he woll ete if he be a rich man
set tofore him many metes / of which that one is better tha^ that other For
a fycysion seyth it shall better save him and better noryshe him and skyll whi:
for mete that is taken with delight the stomak hugely coueteth hastily kacheth /
long holdyth / and we^defyeth. and that mete that is best defied is most
noryshyng for ma^nys body / Truly other mete that is not defied. is taken with
fulsomnes and defyeth not well / for whi if a man desire more moton then a
capon the moton shall rather be eten / and so of all other metes. But there
that is much dystau^ce in qualyte of metys we mowen not do thus / and also
bewar that it be none errau^t appetyte a^ in wymmen that been with child / and
though (...) otherwhile be / yet shall it not always be denied: Furthermore as
galyen says that at one mele men sholden not ete diverse metes^ therefore at
morrow ete but bred alone / and at even flesh alone / for when two diverse
mete: ben take at one mele. of hem common two euyles / one in either by it
sylfe. a another in hem (...) the together in hemselfe / for then one traueyleth
to torn in to great and heavy humors and that other into (...) and in hem
(...) the (...) mete (...) before it is (...) goyth fourth and draws with him
the (...) mete vndefyed, and if the great mete goo first tofore then the
subtle mete is not defied and may not for the great goo forth. and so it
wexyth corupte / And which of thise manners ever it be / always it is evil /
but more evil it is that the subtle follow the great / for the / chaufyng and
chau^gyng into kind of raunes may be helped / but the chau^gyng into
corupcyon never or seldom and of wonder hard is helped: And thereto accords
Galyen a ficysion and other old doctors. but (...) perauenture a contraryous
costume long used may do away the corrupc^on. Also wete well that virtue of
defyynge is often brokyn when raw mete is put on half soden for the toon
rawnes showueth out the other / and so the half sodyn is corupte: Moreover that
no man ete so much that the stomak be heuyed therwyth ne that his appetyte
cease / But how that uses great exercise and to much and selde and therwyth
eteth unruly and conty^^eth it he shall dye by sodeyn, death or shall feel
wicked likeness. ye though his mete were right good for by cause his dygestyon
is corrupt therefore keep well thy stomak from to much mete and drink / And
it so myshap any time anoon with water and oil or such other spue it out
anon and then sleep / and if thou may not sleep walk softely up and down. and
xxiiij. hours ete not after ne drink not / then ete a lytill with a draught
of good clean wine. so the wine be not to great ne of hihe color. and on the
thyrday have some exercise and be bathed / then ete a little after / and after
sleep and thou may then use this electuare dyatryon as says a fycysion. Two
causes ben of sikenesses / that is diverse metes and long sitting and much
etyng of diverse metes. for of hem ben gendred diverse humors some good and
some evil: long sittyng for then the mete that is first take is defied er the
last begin to defye, and so yt is defied draws with him to the liver that
is vndefyed / and so thise two ben cause of great sikenesses: Also as old wise
men sayen man should never ete his fylle at one mele in taking diverse metes /
for as a uycenne says no thing is worse than to multyple metes and so to
sytte long thereat / for thy he says that men in old time were^ satysfyed at
morrow with bred alone and at even with flesh allone / And therwyth they sayden
resonably the more mete should betowarde even / but the costume were contrary /
for a eyre^ne seyth that hoole men should better ete at ^yenste night then no
morrow / for the kyndel^ (...) is closed within them and gadreth about the
bowelles. Netheles flewmatyk me^ ete not to cold for they neden but lytill
exercise to meue her kindeli hete which mow ete by the morrow / But now the
most usage is herr ageyn and among / many me^ it is found more wholesome to
ete by day then by night / and perauenture that is skyll of costume / And
therefore thus says a wyseman short so^per and light soper is seldom grievous.
great sopers noye^ as leches teche^ we read it often ope^li also as a uyce^ne
seyth between two etynges (...). hours to be is profitable / and so ete thries
^ two days / as to day twyes and to morrow but ones and so to continue forth /
so that if error fall in twyes etyng / and so age^yward for that one most be
amended by that other since it is hard to leave without error: moreover
understand that men that have good understanding. etyn for they would live.
but they that goon by fleshelynes wolden live for to ete and contrary to nature
/ And wit thou well that to a coleryk ma^nys stomak when y^ virtue is strong
/ and great hete great metes ben good / as be off porke great venyson^ and g^te
bestly fyshes roughe and great bred salt mete flesh half sodyn and great
mighty colored wine / and if the hete of the stomak be feeble and if he have
but lityll exercise the metes aforsayd would much noye him but to such a
stoma^ give subtyl metes as chekyns and small fyshes of stony rennyng water /
Year eggs bred well baken and well soured small wine and of clean and orye^t
color not deep and such other But thise metes sh^^^en be corrupt of a^
(...) stomak. And if the virtue dygestyff be in y^ mean time of dyetyng / as
capones (...) pertryches and such other: Also in governance of health / fle
all excessyuous metes and namely these but if it be for a medycyne / fle also
all fruits and also herbs that been not good as thise namely. cole wortes and
letuys for they make^ malyncolyouse blood. galye^ says yt my fader ever forbad
me yt I should ete no new fruits and grene if I would be without sekenes for he
him self did and was ever wythouten sikenesses / and while he lived so did I
and was also wythouten sikenes / and when he was ded I eete fruits and caught
the feueres / and after that I caughte connyng to keep my silfe I kept me from
fruits and I had no more the feue^s / but if it were a little sharp feuere
called offymera. and all my friends that kepten my doctrine / kept hem from
fruits and hadde^ her health. Arnolde a great / clerk says thus / In is le^te
long vsag of stoppyng metes as fyshe and pese potage. therefore it is profitable
first to ete porcey of peses for this is a water that wise men has commended.
and thus it is made / do pesyn in fair water all night and in the same water
boil them on morrow a / good while and then cleanse them and keep the
clensyng and when mete time comyth do thereto a lityl wine a lityll powder of
spyknarde a lityll safron^ and clean small white salt and than boil it on a
walme. and so ete / for it opens and clensith well the capytalle veins of
the liver and the weyes often of the vryne / and keeps fro y^ stone and
grauelles namely if the foresaid pes^n^ be soden in the forsaid water with
persily How a man should have him in his drink.

THe less ye drynk at mete the better it is enre so it be mesurably taken. for
a man should not at mete drink much lest it make mete to swymme in his
stomak: forthy men should drynk a lityll. so that the mete be well medeled and
tempred together / And then let alo^ge while between or thou drink again. and
than drink a great draught at ones ne drink not to much aftyr the first
morsel in no manner of wise / but drink often a lityll and a lityll if small
clean wine best according to health and gouernynge of thy complexion and
nature. and for health of body is clean and small claret wine not to new ne to
mighty so it be well and proporcyonli tempred with the quantyte of clean water
/ Moreover no man be so hardy to drynk fasting cold water / ne after that he
has accompanied with a woman ne after great travail ne after excersice till he
have first rested him. ne by night namely if he have do glove tofore. for whi
long sleep and fast skpyng is cure thereto.

What shall be done after mete:
AFter when thou have ete thou sholdest sto^de or walk a lityll softly up and
down^ till toy mete goo down to the botom of thy stothak and then sleep a
lityll if thou be used therein both day and night namly sleep first on thy
sight side for that is kyndely for thy dygestio^ rhall be better / for then
lies thy liver under thy stomak / as fire under a caudren: And after thy first
sleep turn on thy lift side that thy right side may be r^sted of thy long
lygyng thereon / And when thou have layen thereon a good while and slept turn
again on thy right side and there sleep all night forth / and look y^ thou lie
not to straight ne to crooked with thy legs but in a mean between straight
and crooked. And in no wise lie not vpryght / for the^ woll the superfluyte^s
abide within the and turn to wyeked and grievous euylles contrary to health /
Also to lie grouelyng on the womb is good / so that thy breath be not grieved
there with and the heuyer / and the gretter thy mete be and the more thou have
taken thereof / ever the le^ger should thy night sleep be: and ever y^ subtiler
yt thy mete be and ye less thou have ever ye less should thy sleep be. For
sleep is full helpy to old me^ for it makes them moist and therefore says
galye^ when he was old he ete letuses with spyses for he would sleep the
better / Morouer sleep is full helpy to the dygestyo^ of thy metes but not
anon after that thou have even / for thou myghtist be strangled Also wete thou
that if a man before auyntisshid of his body / much sleep then is not good for
him for it woll waste his moystnes / and of one thing beware that to long
sleep or to short febleth a ma^nys body and breketh it / And after thou have
eten take no letuaryes ne other hot things. for they tournen thy mete to
corrupco^n / ne a none after thou have ete re^ne not ne ride not to fast for
then every strong meuyng thing turns thy mete to corrupcyon / and also the
virtue dygestyf is norys head through rest. also after mete and tofore mete as
much as thou may flee wrath sorrow and pencyfulnesse. and right as to fore
mete exercyses be^ good / so after mete they noye^ and rest is best / Morouer
aueroys seyth right as cold water cast in apotte boylyng lets the boiling
for a time. so to drink after mete namely sone lets the dygestyon and
makes it to cease for a time / and therefore yt is not good after mete to drynk
much till ye mete be defied. but after mete to suffer thurst somewhat is good:
And if thou wolt easily void thy stomak stand aftur thy souper tylle thou be
weary or walk a thousand paces / and wrte thou that glotery and when thy mete
defyeth not well what ever the caas be / bathing ne blood lettynge ne
exercise ben not good. but rest sleep abstynence and diatryon pypion Exercise
is not good for thereby should thikke raw humors be loose and then thereof the
lymes sholden be noryshed / and that were evil For why in such exercise the
kyndly hete is not comforted / but more febled and straunglyd for the raw
humors arn^ dyssolued / for right as water quenches fire. so raw humores
quench the kind health:

of noyes of evil governance
THere ben many that only not vsen evil governance in metes and drynkes but
also strongely mayntene it / and as they seyen ben well at ease and well
defyen. and they scorn leches and other wise men that vsen good governance /
for they believe that they should be excused of their error by her long
custume For whi custume is a full strentgh in keeping of ma^nys body / And that
said galyen thus custume is better defied. wherefore thus says Anyceen evil
mete used is better the^ good mete not used. the contrare of all theyse seyth
Constantyne as yt seems thue / glade they not that vsen evil mete though they
be not now hurt after they shall not so escape / Herto men mowen thus sey that
custume accords with kind or nay / if it accord yt shall be holde^. and if
it acordeth not and be not roted it shall be cast away / but not suddenly but
little a lityl: For thy though it seem hem that have good gouernaylle of
custume. that they been wese by reason of custume virtue strength or age /
Nethelesse her virtues wasten preueli and so every day they ordeyne hem to
lepre or to sodeyn death: As they that long time vsen beef old saltyd or
bestely fyshes or raw flesh / or they that sleep to lityl / or exercisen
tomoche after mete. or out of mesu^^ cold or hot and so of many other /
truly of such (...) may be said But if they leave of: they shall not asterte the
stroke of death.

For health of body. couere for cold thy head
ete no raw mete / take good head hereto
Drink holsom wine. feed the on light bread
With an appetyte rise from thy mete also
With wymmen flesshely. have not adoo
Upon thy sleep. drink not of the cup
Glad toward bed at morrow both two
And use never late for to suppe
And if it so be that leches done the fail
Then take good head to use things thr^
Temporat dyete temporat travail
Not malyncolyouse for none aduersite
Meke in trouble glad in pouerte
Rich with lityll / content with suffysaunce
Never grutchynge merry like thine degree
Yef fysik lack make this thy governance
To every tale sone give thou no credence
Be not to hasty ne suddenly vengeable
To pour felke do no vyolence
Curtoys of langage. of fedyng mesurable
On sondrye mete not gredy at the table
In fedyng gentle / prudente in dalya^nce
Clos of tongue. in word not deceyuable
(...) say the best set always thy plesau^c^
(...) in hate mowthes that been dowble
^^ffre at thy table no detraceyon
Have dyspyte of folk that been troubelous
Of false raueners and adulacyon
Within thy court suffer no dyuysion
Within thy householde it shall cause increse
Of all welfare prosperyte and foyson
With thy neyghbourhes live in rest and peace
Be clean cladde after thine estate
Pass not thy bonds / keep thy promise blyue
With three folk be not at debate
First with thy better beware for to strive
Ayenste thy felaw no quarrel for to contryue
With thy subget to strive it were shame
Wherefore I counseyll pursue all thy live
To live in pease / and get the a good name
Fire at morrow / and toward bed at eve
Ageyn mystes blake / and eyer of pestylence
Be time at mass thou shall the better cheue
First at thy risynge to do god reverence
Vpsite the pour with entere dyligence
On all nedy have compassyon
And god shall send grace and influence
The to increase and thy possessyon
Suffer no furfetis in thy house at night
War of reresou^ers. and of great excess
Of noddyng hedys / and of candell light
Of sloth at morrow and slombryng Idylnesse
Which of all vice is chief porteresse
Void and dronkelewe. liars and lechours
Of all unthrifty exile the mastres
That is to say dyseplayers and hasardours
After mete beware make not to longeslepe
Head fete and stomak preserve aye from cold
Be not to pe^sif: of thought take thou no keep
After thy rent mayntene thy howsholde
Suffer in time in thy right be bold
Swear none oaths no man to begyle
In thought be lusty. sad when thoou art old
No worldely Joy lasts but a while
Drink not at morrow before thyn appetyte
Clear eyer and walkyng makith good digesti^^
Between meles drink not for no lityl delight
But thirst or traueyll give the occasion
Over salt mete does great oppressyon
To feeble stomak when they can not refreyne
Fro thing contrary to their complexyon
Of gredy ha^dys the stomak has great pain
Thus in two things sto^dyih all thy wealth
Of soull and of body / who so list hem show
Moderate fode gives to man his health
And all surfetes does from him remewe
And charity to the soul is dew.
This receyte boughte is of no potycarye
Of master antony ne of master hughe
To all indyfferent it is rychest dyetarye
