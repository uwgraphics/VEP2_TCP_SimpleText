The most rare, strange and wonderful examples of Almighty God; showed in
the City of Telonne in Prouence, on a cruel Papisticall Bishop, with the
preservation of the Lady Deermoga, whose life he vowed to have.
CHristian Reader, to deliver unto you the many wonders of the almighty God,
with what signs and tokens he has showed, would fill large volumes, and weary
you with the hearing and reading of the same, wherefore omitting circumstances,
I shall here deliver unto you the truth and certainty, by honest men approved,
and of good reckoning in the Towns where they dwell, the most strange and
wonderful work of God, lately shown, in two several Cities in the streets,
not past two months since. The straungenes and wonderful work whereof God
grant may cause in us true repentance of our sins, and learn us to amend our
evil lives, putting of the old sin and clothing us a new, with the pure
garment of faith, fearing to offend the Majesty of the most highest, and
dreading to feel that utter cross which was lately laid on our neighbors,
for their wickedness, and for our example.

In the Country of Prouence, in a Town called Tellonne, which holds for the
King, yet are for the greater part Catholics as they term themselves, in
this town, dwelled a Lady called Madam Deormoga, sister to a man of good name,
and late wife to a most brave and gallant man and a brave soldier while he
lived, and an earnest professer of the truth. This Madame Deermoga, the 24. of
March now last past, supping at the Governors house being her kinsman, chanced
at the table to enter talk of her religion, being a zealous Protestant, on
whom, there was so many bayting to draw her from the truth, as it did not a
little grieve the good Lady, having no body but God that defends the cause of
the just to say for her, or in any wise to help her to answer a word. After
long communication hot on both sides, a certain Bishop, which had some
authority in that place threatened her, protesting that the next day he would
call her in question, and so accusing her of heresy, put her to death, defying
her with very odious speeches, and tearming her at his pleasure, who was nobly
borne and every way his better.

The time of night calling every one to their rest, they took leave each of
others, committing the Lord of the house to his quiet, but the Bishop whose
heart encenced with envy toward the Lady, gave her this cauiat, to be the
next day when she should be called of another mind, or else provide to fry a
faggot, affirming therewith by great oath that it was not for her sake they had
borne with her as they had.

To whom the Lady Deormoga replied, assuring him that she waied not what he or
any Priest of Ball could do, for God was her defense, and by his passion she
hoped of everlasting life, daring him to do what he could, alleging many
places out of the scripture, wherein she had sure comfort and hope of Christ,
not forgetting to put him in mind how God by his power freed Daniel, the three
children in the Oven, Susanna from the Elders, and infinite others, seeing my
Lord quoth she, that such is the power of my Savior, I fear not you nor what
you can do: And so farewell: and favor me as I shall desire your friendship.

Thus parted they, and the rest of the company many the Ladies friends, which
did know the condition of the Bishop, and with what cruelty he pursued those
whom he envied, knowing by his countenance, that he was thoroughly moved,
greatly lamented the good Lady, albeit they liked not of her religion. But
behold, the wonder of the great God of Israel, how from the cruel jaws of
this blood thirsty Prelate, the Lord delivered this verteous and innocent
Lady, even as Phato with his host was overwhelmed, so was this Bishop
overtaken in his own sin.

The night being well spent ere the company parted, it was near twelve a
clock ere the Bishop was laid in his bed, where he had scarsly remained one
hour and his people at quiet but throughout the house there was heard the most
grievous noyce that might be imagined, so that those which awaked therewith,
with the terror thereof was near besides themselves. In this manner, for one
hour or more, most odiously it continued, and ever the principal and chiefest
thereof was heard, toward the Bishops own lodging, who for that he called not,
nor made any means for his servants they lay all still as full of fear as
ever were men.

Before two of the clock the watch of the Town descried in the Bishops house
a great fire, which no sooner perceived, but they repaired to their
Lieftenantes lodging, and him thereof advertised, who doubting some treason,
took with him forty or fifty of his company, and coming to the house
adressed themselves, to seek relief for the staying the same, first breaking
open the gates and beseeching the company of the house to direct them for
things necessary as ladders and things to bring water, the servants thus
amazed at the sodeinnes thereof could not tell what to do, but like men
distraught ran up and down, at length one amongst the rest, called to mind
their Lord, perceiving the fire to be near his lodging cried out to the
Lieftenant who was without the house busied in setting the company a work for
help, and told him the fear he had of the Bishop in whose lodging the fire
was, upon these speeches the Lieftenant repaired to the Chamber door which was
yet whole, and with his company began to lift at it to get it open, where a
voice shrill and fearful, commanded them to let all rest, for the Bishop with
his Idols and gold which he loved must perish together. The Lieftenant albeit a
worthy Gentilman, was heereat more amazed, then if he had been in the field
environed with enemies, and forbear his own hands commanding the rest to
stay, who being full of courage continued still, thinking it some jest, or
some illusion, and were stricken, one lame, and two slain out right.

The Lieftenant which saw this strange strategeme, was not a littell amazed,
and lamentinge his people, caused them to be carried away, they that were on the
outside the house, heauinge water, was diverse times teryfied with the same
voice, who for lack of government regarded nothing, amongst which so many were
grievously hurt, some fell of the house so into the fire and were pitifully
burnt, but in vain was all their labor, for nothing might help or avail the
Bishop till all was consumed.

By this day approached when the house was near consumed, when the Lieftenant
with some of his followers entered the lodginge of the Bishop, but found all
consumed, and nothing to be seen or heard of him, with the report of which had
happned, the Lieftenant repaired to the lord Gouerner, and to him recounted
what had happened, with the fearful voices, which so terryfie them, at whose
speeches, the Gouerner so much amazed as flesh might be, began to recount the
power of the omnipotent God, who had wrought this miracle, amongst many others
to draw the unbelievers to know him, and to protect the innocent Lady, from
the cruelty of that balamite which had so professed himself her enemy, for
the truths sake, the Lady whose charity excelled the cruiltie of the envious
Bishop, grieved not a little for his death, and in charity besought his divine
magestie, not to impute his sins unto him.

Lo thus the reward of bludthirstines, he yt pretended the overthrow of this
good Lady, was in his own sins overthrown, the Lord make us mindful of
his grace, thankful for his benifites, and endue our hearts with charity,
send an unity in the Church and confound Idolatry.

An other most rare exampele four days after that happened, lamentable and
full of pitye, in the City of Arger in Turkey, as they were at prayer
according to the manner of the country, a most sudden darkness fell upon
them, and presentlye ensued such a fearful clap of thunder as would have
terified the hardest heart, with which also fell great store of lightening which
fiered the one end of the church, through which there ensued a most cruel
fire, which consumed the same in short time, by which many were slain, some
with the fall of stones, and diverse by seeking to quench the same, the Gouerners
house with diverse others was likewise consumed.

Also a ship of corn and bread ready baked, which was stayed by the gouerner,
bownde for the relief of Telonne, which was greatly destressed, for it rarely
was by this lightning fiered and consumed, the men being all prisoners, two
days after which ship was consumed, in the road from the ship was seen to
come so many Rattes as amazed men to behold, who recoueringe the shore, so
greatly anoyed the city that there dwelled none therein which complained not
of the harm was done by them.

Thus have I for example, written this true history, and lamentable
strategeme, for your benyfit, the like whereof has seldom bine hard, the holy
scriptures declare many wonders of the Lord, besides what our eyes have been
witness of, by many and several signs in the air, monsterous byrthes and
oher exterordinarie chances, all to draw us to amendment of life, which the
God of all glory grant for his son Jesus Christ's sake, Amen.

FINIS.
