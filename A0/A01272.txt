An other book against Rastel named the subsedye or bulwark to his first book /
made by Ihon Frithe preso^ner in the Tower.)()(

Awake thou that slepeste and stand up from deeth / and Christ shall give
the light.

Ephesia^s. v. (.) The prologe.
IT neadeth not Christen reader (I think) now that thou haste over red and
diligently pondered in thine inward senses that the treatise of Ihon Frith where
in he confuteth all the reasons which Rastel / More / and Rochester made for
the maynte naunce and vpholdinge of the bitter pains of purgatory: to commend
unto the this brefe work folowinge named a subsidy defense or bulwark to the
same. And much less needs it to dehorte the from the vain and chyldyshe
fear which our fore fathers have had of that place of purgatory / as
their goodworkes which at this day remain upon the yerth founded for their
thens delyueraunce do testifye. And for as much as thou art a christen man
and reioysest in christ I dare boldly affirm for the / that thou take
another pleasure nor joy of that place / like as some persons do / which
triumphed of late and with moch^ joy and clappynge of hands / send tydinges
in to all pertyes that purgatory was found again. Because they read in a
book named the institution of a christen man this word purgatory. And yet have
I not heard hitherto that the self persons have showed any tokens of gladness:
for gods word translated in to english so that to me they seame to rejoice
more to have the sely souls purged with puynyshme^tes when they be departed
then to have them purged with the word of God while they be here. who will
think but as they have uttered their hearts concerning purgatory with their
tongues / eue^ so they say in their stomakes / that their holy father the pope
(who^ we may as justly call the bishop of Rome / seeing: ^hryst is (...) in
^^to Pet. Paul.
he is there the heed of S. Peter's church as we may call the heed of S. Paul's
church in London bishop of London) has recovered again here in england his
old auctoryte / ye that ^e never yet lost it because they find in their
churches / coopes / roopes / bells and beads / with other like holiness / and on
them selves long gowns shaven crowns and fyngers anointed with the holy
oil of ydeldes / for who will say but that these holy relics declare the
bishop of Rome as clarklye as this word purgatory proves a place to be where
souls after the departure from their bodies suffer pains and punyshmentes /
does not this pretye pagent of purgatory sygnifye and pronosticat what tragedy
they will play hereafter / when the word of god shall blow and scater from
the face of the earth the dark clouds and mistes of men's inuencions and shall
score away the ruste of fleslye understanding of the scriptures in other
things like wise as it has done in this if ought may be found in that book
where with they may resyste? that such things may be picked out of it / the
fruit which commonly has come of all counsels co^uocacions and synodes
sythens the apostles time (very few excepted) causes me somewhat to fear for
if a man way the good with the bade that has spronge from them / he will
perchance think that the lay people of all estates may well and justly say
farewell the one with the other and no meruel for they have not been all the
chylderne of one father that have been in counsels as they have not been al
sheep that has gone in shepes clothinge and often times the greater part over
comes the better / which things gathered by experience and by readinge
causeth^ me often times to wyshe that they which would be counted sincere and
true mynisters of the gospel either might and would clean abstain from such
councils that they have no perte in them / or else that they would give no more
place to the fruits of i^fidelite (I mean men's inventions and carnal
interpretatio^s which the faith in christ never begat) then saint Paul gave
to Peter his college when he leafte the table of the gentiles and went to the
Jews / which fact of Peter in my judgment / Paul might more co^uenie^tly
have aproued seeing Peter did it to the intent he would not offend his weak
brethern^ the Jews with his eatinge; then the true and sincere ministers of
christ in the gospel may wincke at many things used in this days among the
disciples of the gospel much less may they approve the^ with the fashion of
there own living / and confirm the^ with the auctorite of a counsel and with
preachinge they say it is not time to speak against them / be it yet is it
time to leave them and no longer to seame to allow the^ onles they entend
always to walk i^ the^ had the auctor of this book looked after a time as some
do he had not wryte^ against purgatory when he did I fear me some mayntaine
blyndnes more with there symulacyon then they open the light with there
preachinge. But this have I spoken good reader besides my purpose which was non
other then to admonysh the that althought Rochester / More / and Rastell have
all three (as thou perceyuest by readinge this former treatise) stiffely
defended one he resye / yet should thou not have of all three one judgment or
opinion / More and Rochestre were me^ of high dignite in this world / the one
a byshope / the other chaunceler of this noble realm of England / both
ancient in years of so great wit and so synguler eruditio^ in all kind of
lerninge esteemed as well of them selfs as of many other that no.ii. like might
in all this land be found: it was thought that for there dignite noma^ durst
for there years wit and lernyng noma^ was able to again say the^ / wherefore
they were persuaded to be the most meat of all other to take in hand the
defense of the terrible pains of purgatory either the very foundation or else
the cheffe building set upon the foundation of the church of Rome Rastell
had nothing common with the^. But only many years and awyt sophistical which
he called natural reason / as a pertaininge to gods word he aknowleged
himself ignorant thereof notwithstondinge had such opinion of his wit that he
thought he could as well prove purgatory by it as the other.ii. had done by
the scryptures wherein I think he was not deceived and as this iii persons were
not like so took they the answer made to them not a like / More and Rochestre
thought foul scorn (see what the glory of this world and high estimacion of
our selfs does) that a ionge man of small reputacio^ should take upon him so
clean contrary to their opinion to write against the^. And to be short took
the matter so greuouslye / that they could never after be quiet in their
stomakes until they had dro^ken his blood Rastell though he perceived his
natural reason to be sore said to / yet was he not malicious as the other were
And therefore wrote he again / which work of Rastell came to his hands when
he was presonner in the Tower of London / where he made the answer following to
the same which answer after Rastell had read / he was well content to count
his natural reason folyshnes and with hearty thanks given to god becam a child
again and sucked of the wisdom which comes from above and saves all that be
noryshed therewith in the which he continued to his lyfes end with the honor
and glory of God to whom be prase for ever. Amen.

Here follows te preface of this book.
BRother Rastell I thank you that it had pleased you to be so favorable unto
me a pore presoner as to show me a copy of your book which you have written to
confute my reasons and scripture that I have alleged against purgatory / for
that has caused me to make a subsydy defense and bulwark to my book which by
gods grace shall be an occation to open more light / although not to you / yet
at the lestwyse unto them whose hearts the prince of this world has no^ Cor^.
4
blinded but that the light of the gospel and glory of Christ may shine in
the^ And where as you write and proteste that you will brenge no scripture
against me. But only rehersse my scripture again which I have alleged
vnperfeytlye and wound me with mine own darts / and will but even do as one
that plays at tennes with another tossinge the balle again / I do very
well admit your similitude.

Not withstodinge you know right well that it is not I noughe for a man playinge
at te^nes to toss the ball again / but he must so toss it that the the other
take it not. For if the other smite it over again then is the game in as great
ieoberdy as it was before besides that he must take heed that he neither smite
to short of the lynne nor yet under / for then it is a loss and he had been
better to let it go. And finallye sometime a ma^smyteth over and thynkethe al
won / and yet an ungracious post stondeth in the way and makes the ball to
rebounde back again over the cord and loses the game. And that will anger a
man / and I assartayne you that ye have tossed never a ball but ye offend in
one of this points / and yet besides that sometime ye play a touch of
legerdemayne and cast me a ball which when it commythe I perceive to be non of
mine / and all the court shall judge the same. This points shall be declared
when we come to them / and now I will answer in order.

An answer to Rastels first prologe.
IN your prologe you assigned. ^astell
ii causes of the making of your.i. book of purgatory without alleginge any
textes of scripture for the prove thereof which are the co^trouersye of.ii.
sorts of people. One sort you say be those that believe not i^ Christ / but
deny christ and his scripture as be the turks paynims and suh other
miscreau^ts An other sort be they that believe in christ and his scripture nor
will deny no text of holy scripture / but yet they will construe expo^de and
interpret this textes after their owue wylles and obstinate mind. etc.

Now let us consider your foresaid causes and po^der whether your book have or
may do any such good as you say pretended / and whether it have converted those
sorts of people / or else by any thing likely to do such a fact. And first
let us se what it profyteth the first sort which are infideles not beleui^ge
i^ christ nor his scripture. John. 3.
Our sa^iour christ says / he that believes is not dampened / and Iho^ Bap.
confirms the same saying: he that believes in the son^e has euerlasti^ge
lyffe / but he that believes not in the sone^ shall not se life / but the wrath
of god abides upon hi^. Here it is evident not be my exposicyo^ / but by the
consent of all christian men / that those in fideles are dampened / for what
intent tha^ should Rastel teach the^ that there is a purgatory: without christ
their is no way but da^pnacy on as scripture and all faithful men testifye.
The^ would I know by what way he would persuade that there were a purgatory
(which should be away and ameane to salvation and not to da^pnacio^) for them
which believe not in Christ. This I am sure of (and I think Rastell believes it
also) that the infydeles shall never come in it though their were one? This
you may se that his first cause is very vain / and that if they did believe
it they were in dead deceived.

Now let us proceed unto the second sort of poeple (which believe in christ
and his scripture and yet misconstrue it / expou^ding it after their own
wills) And let us se what fruit they take of this book and what it profyteth
them and we shall find that it less serves these me^ the^ the fryste: for if
this men believe in christ and in his scripture / the^ is it not possible that
they should receive or admytte that thing which is against the scripture
both by the exposicio^ of the^ selves and of all the world For this is both
against scripture and all faithful men that there should be any way to health
if we exclude Christ and his scripture And sith purgatory is counted away to
health / he that would go about to prove it / secludynge Christ and scripture
is against scripture and all faithful men.

Besides that if they be so obstynate that they will not receive the very
scripture but expound it after their own wylles and wrest it after the same /
then will they much less receive your book which is so plain against
scripture / and therefore if you would think that they could be tamed by your
book which notwitstonding so wresteth scripture / the^ may I very well lyken
you to him that has a wild horse to tame which when he perceueth that he ca^
not hold him with a scokry she snafle will yet labor to break hi^ with a
rotyn twyne threde: So that I can espy no manner of profit that can come of
your book if you can allege no better causes the^ you yet show / but that it
had been a great dele better on written.

And brother Rastel where you say that I auaunce and boste my self much more
then becomes me / and that I detraycte and slander my neighbors / and that I
provoke all me^ that read my book rather to vice the^ to virtue with such other
things as ye lay to my charge / I trust I shall declare my inconuenyence and
give you a sufficient answer.

An answer to Rastels first Chapter which reproves me for boostynge my self.
IN the first chapter of this book Rastel Rastell
labors to prove that I am sore over seen in laudinge and bosting my self
and that I like my self so well that he is sure that other men do like me the
less / and that he fereth that god will therefore like me and favor me rather
the worse then the better.

Here he iogeleth with me and would make Frith
me believe that he tossed me mine own ball again / but when I behold hit / I
perceive it to be non of mine: for he has cut out all that should make for me
so that he has given it clean an other shape then ever I intended that it
should have as it appears by his writing which reherseth my words in this
manner.

I am sure there are many that merueyll Rastell.
that I being so young dare atempte to dyspute this matter against these.iii.
persons. But my words are this / I am sure that Frith
there are many that will much meruayll that I being so ionge and of so
small lerning dare dispute this matter etc.

Here Rastell leueth out the words (and of so smake learning) for if he had
put that in he had be wrayed him self. For I think no man so mad as to say
that he which says him self to be both young and of small lerninge should
praise and boste him self.

Also immediately after the words of his first allegacion I say on this manner:
And as touching my lerninge I must needs aknowlege (as the truth is) that it
is very small which I think is but a base bosti^ge / and anon after I say I
would not that any man should admit my words or lerninge except they will
stand with the scripture / and be approved thereby / lay them to the touchstone
and try them with gods word / if they be found false and contrary then
da^pne them / and I shall also revoke them with al mine heart. etc.

Hynallye I exhorted them to read my book not aduertysynge whoo speaks the
words but rather what is spoken / by why the words you might well se that I
intended not to boste my self / and all this have I written / and he left it
out eue^ in the first page (as he calls it) wherein he reports that I boste
my self. Rastell.


Notwithstondinge one thing does sore vex him that I should recyte the
pystell of S. Paul wherbye he says I would have me^ believe that I had the
sprete of god and think that though I be young that I se visyons and espy the
truethe / and that my elders have dremed dremes and wandered in phantasyes.

This he recounteth to be a great boste and Frith
that this one place should win him the field where unto I answer that in
dead my words do not prove that thing / which you seem ^o suerly to gather of
the^ / but my words do argue on this manner / that no man ought to conde^pne a
thing before he read it (...) then to give sentence / and because you seem
ignorant in the matter I shall declare it unto you / and how it stondithe / it
is a color of rethoryke / and is called auantopodosis that is to say an
answer to an obieccio^ that a man might have here made on this manner: thou
grauntest thy self young and so small learning doste thou the^ think that we
shall once read or regard thy book / specially sithe it is written against
ancient men both of great wit and dignyte? to this two points I answer
preuentinge their obieccion that they should not dispyse it because of my youth
/ for as the sprete of god is bound to no place / even so is he not addicte to
any age or person but enspyreth where he will and when he will and brenge in
for an ensample that he espyred young Tymothe prouinge there by that the youth
of it self is not to be despised / but according to the learning which it
brings and that therefore they may not despise my youth but first read what
doctrine I bri^ge and thereafter do judge it: no more in this I proved not that
I am enspyred and have the sprete of god as Tymothe had / but only prove that
God may enspyre youth as he did Tymothe / and that therefore ye ought first to
read before you condemn / for you know not who is enspired and who not until
you have read their works or seen their factes. Thus you may se that my words
define not that al yough is enspyred although some may be / but I exhort that
no man despise 1. Tess. 1.
prophesies / but prove all and approve that is good / and to make the matter
more plain I shall bring you an example out^ of Paul to the Hebreus which
exhorts Hebre. 13.
the^ to hospytalyte / for by that some men onwares have received angeles to
herber / be not therefore vnmyndful of it / here Paul exhorts you to
hospitalyte and showing you that by those means some men have received angels
into their house / would not have you think that all the gestes which he shall
receive shall be angels / but some shall be ^ewde loselles. And likewise I
inexor^inge you to read my book / and not dyspysynge my yowgth because that
sumtyme godde enspyreth the yo^ge / word not have you think that the books
made of young men (which ye shall receive) shall be wholesome doctrine / but some
men be lewd and unfruitful / nevertheless even as if they received not those
gestes they should also put away angels if any came So if you despice to
read such books as be written by young men you may also fortune to dispyce
the^ which are written by the inspyracyen of Christ's sprete and therefore ye
ought to read them.

But be it in cause I had in dead praised my self (as I have not) and that I
had said that I had the sprete of god / what inconvenience should follow
thereof? would you (...) argue that my doctrine were false? if that were a good
argument / then were thrystes doctrine false / then were Paul a false prophet
and our says nothing for christ said to the Jews that he was the light o^
the world. John. 8.
And again he said: it is my father that glorified me whom you call your god.
Now if it had been a sufficient argument to condemn his doctrine / because
the world callethe it bostynge than should we have believed no truth at all.
Besides that Paull seems not a lyttel to boste him self 2. Cor. 11
if men look on it with a carnal yie / for he says that he thinks not him
self inferior unto the highest apostels / and says again that if they glory
to be the mynisters of Christ (though he speak vnwyslye) he is more copyous
in labors / in strypes above measure / in preson more often / often at the
point of death. etc.

Should we for this words think that his doctrine were not right? Nay
verelye that does not inproue the doctrine / but that it may be good and
wholesome for a man may boste himself and do well so he refer the praise to
God from whom all goodness comes: but be it in case that I should say that god
of his mere mercy and for the love that he owes me in Christ and his blood
had given me his sprete that I might be to his laud and praise to whom be
thanks for ever. Ame^. would you thyncke that this were so great abostinge
that the doctrine should be impaired therbye? Ah blind gydes I pray God give
you the light of understanding / I beseech you brother Rastell be not
discontent with me if I axe you one questyon / be ye a Christen man or no? I am
sure you will answer yes / then if I brought you the text of Paul which
says: Rome. 8.
he that has not the sprate of god is non of his / I pray you how will you
avoid it Notwithsto^ding if you would avoid that text / yet will I say an
other block in the way that you shall not be able to remove / and that is the
saying of Paul. ^. Cor. 13.
2. Corinthians. 13. Know ye not your selves that Christ is in you? except ye be
reprobate persons / now how soever you would judge of your selfs / I think
verily that I am no such and therefore where as before I did not so write. Now
I certifye you that I am christ's, conclude what ye will / and the day shall come
that you shall suerlye know that so it is / albeit in mean season I be reputed
a laughingstoke in this world for I know in whom I trust and he came not
deceue me.

Then brings he against me that I Bastell
say we have been long secluded from the scripture and also that our fore
fathers have not had the light of gods word opened unto them.

I meruayll what Rastell meanethe by Frith
bringing this for his purpose / for I think it no bostinge of my self / but
if ye think that it be untrue / I think he is very blind. For what scripture
has the poor co^mens been admitted unto even till this day? It has been and
locked up in a strange tongue and from the^ that have attained the knowledge of
that tongue has it ben locked with a thousand salse gloses of antichrystes
making and innumerable laws. And where I say our fore fatheres have not
had the light of gods word opened unto the^ / I mean that they have not
the scripture in their own mother tongue / that they might have conferred these
iuggeling mistes with the light of gods word as the process of my words
can testifye which he has holy left out / but I beseech the christen reader
once to read the place for my discharge and his confusyon / ye shall find it
in the second lefe of my book.

And now he allegeth against me that I should say this: Rastell
judge Christen reader what reasons Rastell has brought and how he has
soluted them / for in my mind both his reasons and solucyons are so childyshe
and unsavory / so unlearned and baren so fulle of fautes and phantasyes that I
rather pitye the man's deep ignorance and blyndnes which has so deceived him
self through phylosophye and natural reason / then I fear that he by his
vain probacyons should allure any man to consent unto him.

I think Rastell lays not this against me / because I boste my self in these
words: ^rith
And verily as touching the truth of those words I will add thus much more
unto them / that I never wys man that was counted wise which hath^ brought so
slender reasons except he intended to destroy a thing which ye seem to have
bylde. Rastell.


And fynallye where as I exorte all me^ to judge and confer the scriptures
which sir Thomas More and my lord of Rochestre allege for their opinions and
would have them to pondre their reasons and my solucions unto them annexinge
these words I am sure that my small learning hath^ condemned their hye
eloquence / that my folly has brought to naught their wisdom and that my
youth hath^ disclosed their festered ignorance.

There Rastell thinks that I stand Frith
well in my own conceyte and boste my self above the moon because I touch
Master More his kynsma^: but let Rastell take this for an answer / if Master
More would keep him within his own bonds that is with medelynge of worldly
matteres only / I would never compare with him / yet he must remember that a
dawler may correct him in his own craft / but it is even as Socrates says
/ when a man is wise in one thing then will he take upon him to defyne all
things and be ignorant in nothing and so dysdayneth. The gift that he has
and proves himself onwyse.

Furthermore I se no great praise that I here attribute unto my self. But
confess my small learning my folly and my youth / nevertheless if he
recounte it a praise because I say it hath^ condemned their hye eloquence and
their wysdom / and disclosed their ignorance / then let him also annexe the
words that I wrote saying: and it is even the old practyse of God to chose
the folyshe things of the world to confound the wise / to chose the weak /
to confound the mighty / and to chose the vile things which are of no
reputacion to confound them of hye degree / that no flesh might boste it
self in his syghte to whom only be praise and thanks for ever Amen.

where all men may se that I refer all praise to him which only is worthy:
and so I may conclude that you have not looked indifferentlye on my book.

An answer unto Rastels second chaptre which improueth me for raylynge and
dyspraysynge other.
IN the second chaptre he rangethe Rastell
the field and sercheth out with all diligens what word I have spoken that
might be taken in the worste sense / and calls them raylynge gestynge and
scoldi^ge and because he would have me to be abhorred of the reader / he
allegeth not only these words that are spoken against himself / but also
that are spoken against my lord of Rochestre and Sir Thomas More / not that
he entendeth to answer for them or to defend their parties ye may be sure /
but only to leave nothing behind which should seem to make for him / like a
noble orator the words that he reproves are these.

There Rastell takes his fondacion up Rastell
po^ a stark lie / and there he makes.ii. lies: and there he makes.iii. lies.

Here I would desire my brother Rastel Frith
to pardon me of a lyt^ell ignorance / for surely I thought it had been no
more offense to call a lie / a lie / them to call a Jew a sheep /
notwithstondinge since he recountethe it to be raylinge ges^ynge and scoldinge /
I will here after tempre my self / and change my words / and will say that
when he lyethe (that by his leave) he makes a fytten.

It angreth him when I say that Rastell Rastell
has lost his wit in purgatory / and therefore I will say so no more. Frith
But this I will affirm (be Rastel never so furyous) that who so ever makes
such reasons and solucions / and counteth^ them good in erneste / that he has
no wit in his head / where so ever he lost it / but if you would read
Rastels first argument which I have set in my book in the twelfe lefe /
then you shall perceive whether I say truethe or not.

Also he allegeth that I should say / that Rastell
saying of Rastell is against scripture / but if he count that raylynge and
would not have me say so much unto him / I will count the man somewhat statlye
/ and this Frith
I ensure him that if God suffer me to leave I will say so again / take it as
he will.

Also he recyteth as a great reproach Rastell
that I should say / I marvel how our scolemen may abide this fellow.

And surely the same I say again for Frith
he prouethe both / Saint Thomas and them also foles and double foles /
which if I should so do would be counted heinous heresye.

Then he reherseth what I say of Master Rastell
more and my lord of Rochestre / and all to help his matter / that when I say
the small probacions and slender reasons that those.ii. wytted men / sir Thomas
More and my lord of Rochestre had brought to confyrme purgatory made my heart
to yerne.

what raylynge or yestynge this is let Frith
other me^ judge / but this I dare auow that I said the truth / for what
should a man do or say to se the^ so contrary in their tales Master More says
that their is fire and no water i^ purgatory: and my lord of Rochester says
that their is both fire and water.m. more says that the mynister of punishment
are deuels And my lord of Rochester says that the minister of punishment are
angels. Master More says that both the grace and charity of them that lie in
pains of purgatory are increased / my lord of Rochestre says the souls of
purgatory obtain there another more / faith nor grace nor charity then they
brought in with the^. Now judge good reader whether I have rayled or said the
truethe / but all this doth^ Rastell leave out full craftily / he recyteth full
diligently both the head and tail / but the middle which expounds the
matter will he not let you se.

He allegeth also against me that I say Rastell
Master More is sore disceyued and set on the sand even at the first brunte
and in the beginning of his viage and that I would wysh master More a little
more wit.

Even that I say again and affirm it Frith
to be true / and is so euydently proved in the beginning of my answer
against Master More that I neade to say nothing / but only refer the
reader unto the place.

Also he improueth me for saying in an Rastell
other place that master More shows him in one text twyse ignoraunte and
that he is to busye / for he understands not the phrase of scripture.

This and such other sayings he allegeth Frith
(which I pass over) for I count it folly to spend paper and labor about
the rehersynge of the^ / for if you read my book you shall se all these
points so plainly proved that he moughte be ashamed to make mention of them.

This he counts gestinge sclanderinge Rastell
and raylinge saying that no reasonable man will think these points to be
things belonginge to virtue / but rather spyces and branches of pride / and
that I show not my self therein charitable but rather malicious nor no wysdom
therein / but rather folly / adding that if I had been half year at two scoles
/ that is to say the scole of discrecion and the scole of cheryte I should
more have prospered in virtuous lernyng then I have done in other scoles
this.vii. year. And says that I have been at the scoles of slanderynge
raylinge and gestinge.

Dear brother if it had been so that I Frith
had spoken certain words in dead which might have seemed in your yies to be
raylinge / detractinge and slanderynge (as I have not / saving a little
gestyng) would you disprove my doctrine thereby? what will you then say to S.
John^ baptist which called the pharyses (then hedes of the church / as are now
our doctors) generation of viperes? Math. 3.
would you therefore conclude that his doctrines where naught / I think you be
not so chyldishe. And it seems this one sentence to be more raylinge and
slanderlyng then all that I have written.

what will you say to Christ which called the scrybes and pharyses hypocrytes.
Math. 15. 16. 22. and in the.13. he semethe to rail above measure / where he
calls them hypocrites / and blind gydes / painted sepulchers / which
onwardlye appear ryghtwyse but within are full of ypocrysye / serpents and
generation of vipers. Besides that he calls herod fox. Luce 1^.
Luce.xiii. and the ^ewes he called a froward and aduouteres generation. Math
12. 16. and in the.17. he says o unfaithful and ouerwharte nacyon / would you
think it should excuse the jews which refused his doctrine to say that he
rayled and that no reasonable man would think those things to be points
belonginge to virtue / but rather spices and branches of pride and that he
showed not himself charitable / but malicious / nor no wisdom therein but
folly / would it excuse them to say (as you do to me) that if he had been one
half year at scole of discrecio^ and chartye / he should more have prospered
in virtuous learning and that he had been at the scoles of sclandering /
raylinge and jesting.

Finally. S. Paul in your yies might appear to rail and sla^der and to be
clean destitute of gods sprete / which as Luc. says replenished with the
holy ghost said to Elemas that (...)
resists hi^ Act. 13. o thou full of al suttelty and deceit thou son^e of
the deuel and enemy of all rightwisnes cease not to peruerte the rightwayes
of the lord. I ca^ bri^ge many m^ such sainges of Peter Joh. James and Judas
and yet I think you will not inproue their doctrine thereby but because I
study to be short / I shall count it sufficient to have warned the reder of
this. Notwithsto^di^g peradventure Rastel will not yet be a^swered / but will say
that albeit I have touched enough as co^cerni^g those things that appear
ra^ling and sla^derig in his yies / yet I brought non that jest as I do / where
unto I may answer and allege for me her^as the prophet which both mocked the
false prestes and gested with the^ / saying call loud unto your gods for
peradventure they are a sleep and ca^ not here / or else they be gone out of
town. I ca^ not enough meruell that my brother Rastel would use such manner of
reasoning with me as to improve my doctrine because of my raylinge and gestynge.

For therewith he has made a foul hole in his kinsma^s best cote for every
man perceyueth that M. More his books are so full of raylinge / gesting and
bandye tales / that if the furyous momus and venus had take out their pertyes
their should be very lyttel left for vulcanus.

After this Rastell dissenteth to the purpose Rastell
of his matter and would prove that my exposicions of scripture are not good
because they are an occasyon to bring the people to boldness of sin and to
move the people to deylte in other men's fautes / and to laughte thereat / and to
put you an ensample: he says / if I should take upon me the exposicion of
this text. In principio erat verbu^ et verbum erat apud deum etc / and
expound it after this manner.

In the beginning of this year
John^ Frith is a noble clarke
He killed a mylstone with his spear
Keep well your geese your dogs do bark.
I trow says Rastell all wise men would think that this were a fond
exposicio^ and yet this exposicoyn would please chylderne foles and mad men /
as well as the exposicy on of Saint Austayne or Saint Hierom or any other
doctor of the church / because it would make them to laugh, so (says
Rastell) Frith makes such exposicions with yestynge and raylinge to make the
people laugh / not regardinge to edifye the people / nor to provoke them to
virtue mekenes or charity nor to leave their syn^e / but rather gives the^
bouldenes and to believe that their is no purgatory nor hell / but mocketh and
yestethe at those reasons that be made for prove of purgatory.

Now as touching the first part / where Frith
he says that my exposicions be an occasion to bring the people to bouldenes
of sin / I axe him why? his answer is because I give them boldness that there
is no purgatory / nor yet hell / thereto Rastel by his leave (makes a fitten) I
dare not say he makes a lie for that he would call^ raylynge for I never
denied hell / but affirm in many places of my book and eue^ in the first side
of mine answer against him I affirm hell / and perpetual dampnacion / but when
ye come to the proof of his words / then you shall se how wyslye the man
concludethe / for he thinks that ab inferiori ad suum superius confuse
distribue / men shall think it a good conseque^t as if I should say that we
lack fire in preson / then would he conclude that there lacked fire in all
middelsex Or if I would say their were no wit in Rastels heed / then would
he conclude that their were no wit in no man's head / he has so long
studied phylosophye / that he has clean forgotten his principals of sophistry
/ notwythstondinge we will forgive him this fault for the man is somewhat aged
and therefore I think it is long synes he readde them / and that they are now
out of his memory: nevertheless he will say that his argument is not soluted for
althougth I deny not hell / yet I deny purgatory / and so I give the people
an occasion to syn^e / because they fere not purgatory / where unto I have so
sufficiently answered in Rastels seuenthe argument that I wonder that he is not
a shamed to brenge^ the same again but he trusts that my books shall never be
read / and his may goo surely abroad / and therefore he may say what he will
only he carried not what he says so he hold not his peace.

And where he reports that I make exposicio^s Rastell
to make the people to delight to here of other men's fautes and to laughe thereat
/ thereto will I say nay / till he be at leisure to prove it / and where he
sayethe / if he should Frith.
^ake upon him to expound / In principio erat verbum in this manner. Bastell


In the beginning of this year
John^ Frith is a noble clarke
He killed a mylstone with his spear
Keep well your geese your dogs do bark.
Saying that all wise men would say that this were a found exposicion.

Thereto I answer that / saying: Fryth
for the ^ime and meter they might well say that a gose had made it for any
reason / that is therein / and (...) as touching the meter / the second verse
lacks a foot / and is shorter the^ his fellows / but if you put out this
word Frith / and put in this word Rastel for it / the^ shall his meter also be
perfeyte / and that haltinge verse shall runue merelye with his fellows upon
his right feet on this manner.

In the beginning of this year
John^ Rastell is a noble clarcke
He killed a mylstone with his spear
Keep well your geese the dogs do bark
Thus I have amended his meter / but as for the reason I leave it to him self
to amend it at his laysure. In the end of his second chaptre he says that I
entende with my exposicio^s to bring the people to believe in.iiii other great
erroures / where of the.i. is that there is no hell / ordained for any that is
of Christ's faith / although he do never so many sins but let us se how he
proves it.

An answer to Rastels.iii. chap. which would prove that I deny hell. Rastell


IT seems (says Rastell) by the reasons that Frithe has alleged that his
ente^te is to bring the people in believe that there is no hell / for I allege
i^ my answer to Rastels dialoge the saying of S. Paul. Ephesi. 1.
Ephe. 1. Christ chose us in him before the begyn^ing of the world that we
might be holy and without spot in his sight and again Ephesians. 5. Christ loved
his co^gregacio^ and gave himself for it that he might sanctifye it in the
fontayne of water through the word to make it without spotte or wryncle or any
such thing / but that it should be holy and without blame.

And upon these textes I conclude / that if Frith.
Christ have so purged us that we are without spotte / wryncle or bame in his
syghte / (as Paul testifyeth / then will he never cast us in to purgatory. For
what should be purged in them / that are without spotte wrincle or blame. And
then somewhat to declare the matter how we be sinners as long as we leave /
and yet without sin in the sight of god and add this words why ^he I would
that all men deed well note the^ and because Rastell leuythe out the best of
the matter / I will rehearse my own words again.

Peradventure every man perceyuethe not what this means that we are
ryghtwyse in his sight / seeing that every man is a sinner.1. John^.2. therefore
I will breuely declare the meaning of the apostell. This is first a clear
case that there leueth no man upon the earth without sin / notwythstondynge
all they that we^e chosen in christ before the foundacyon of the world were
laid are without spot of sin in the sight of God. Ephesians.1. so that they
are both sinners and ryghtwyseyf we consider the imperfeccyon of our faith
and charity / if we consider the conflicte of the flesh and the sprete.
Galathia^s.5. if we consider our rebellyous members which are under sin^e
Romanorum.7. then are we grievous sinners; and contrary wise / if we believe that
of that merciful favor God gave his most dear son to redeem us from
our sin / if we believe that he imputethe not our sins unto us / but that
his wrath is pacefyed in Christ and his blood, if we believe that he has
frelye given us his christ and with him all things / so that we be destitute
of no gift. ^oma. 8.
Romanorum.8. then are we ryghtwyse in his syghte and our concience at peace
with God / not through our selfs / but through our lord Jesus Christ.
Romano. Roma.
5. So may thou perceive that thou art a sinner in thy self / and yet art
thou ryghtwyse in Christ / for through him is not thy sin imputed nor rekened
unto the / and so are they to whom god imputes not their sins / blessed
ryghtwyse, without spotte wryncle or blame. Romanorum 4. Psalmus.31. Roma.
Psalm. 31
And therefore will he never thrust them in to purgatory / and for prove of
this I allege (as Rastell bears me wytnes) diverse textes of Saint Paull.
Ephesians. 2. Roman. 4. 5. 7. 8. Rastell
but that notwithstondenge Rastell sayethe that I have not recyted them
sufficiently / for I have left out sumwhat which I have rehearsed for the
openyng of the truethe / and than brengyth in that Saint Paull* exhorts and
^y^deth us we shall use no fornicacyon on clennes avarice fylth or folysh
speeches for such shall have no inherytance in the kingdom of heaven / and
even so say I to / but judge good reader what is this to the purpose: Frith
for it neither makes for purgatory neither against it. This text I could
have alleged if I had endeuered my self that we should do good works (which I
never knew Christen man deny / but else as touching my matter it is nothing to
the purpose and as well he might have improued me because I brenge in no text
to prove that the father of heaven is god / or to prove that which never man
doubted of.

Then he allegeth Paul. Roma. 5. 6. saying ^astell
though grace do rain through christ shall we therefore dwell in sin / nay god
forbyde says Paul / and eue^ so say I again: he allegeth Romans 8. that there
is no dampnacion to them which be in christ Jesus if they live not after the
flesh / and even so say I / but Rastell will say the contrary anon.

Besides that he allegethe Roman. 3. we be frelye justified by grace / by
Christ's redemption to show his justice for the remission of sin done before
(and yet says Rastell) Paull says that the law is not destroyed by faith
but made stable / but this has Frith left out of his book to cause the
people to believe that they be clean purged / by the blood of Christ only /
and that there neade no purgatory.

By these words you may euydentlye Frith
perceive what Rastell meanethe by this allegynge of paul / for the
establyshynge of the law / verelye that the work of the law should iustifye
and clean purge you from sin which is contrary to Paull and al scripture /
for even in this same Chapter that he allegeth Paull says: that of works of
the law no flesh shall be iustyfyed in his syghte / and says that the
ryghtwysnes of god comes by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all that
believe. But as touching good works I will touch more hereafter.

Furthermore Rastell says that if my Rast^
arguments could prove that there is no purgatory / it must follow as well
that there is no hell for us that be chryste^ me^ though we continue still in
sin / for if we be blessed without spot wryncle or blame / and that therefore
he will not cast us in to purgatory / then he will not cast us in to hell
what soever sin we do commytte.

Here Rastell vtterith his blyndnes unto Frith
you / and shows you what understanding he has in scripture / first he
armeth himself with a false supposicyon and yet there upon he concludes his
argument falselye his supposicion is this / that all men which are baptized
with material water are very Christen men / and have the true faith and be
those which paul affirms to be without spotte blame or wryncle. But thereto I
say nay / for even as the outward circumcisyon made not the Jews the elect
people and chylderne of salvation / so does not the outward baptism make us
the faithful members of Christ / but as they were the children of god which
were inwardly circu^cysed / even so they that are washed inwardly from the
co^cupiscens of this world are the me^bres of christ / whom Paul affyrmeth so
to be purged through his blood. Again: you may know that Rastell knows no
another faith / but that which may stand with all manner of syn^e / but the
faith which we speak of is the same which works through charity / whereof
Paull speaks. Galath. 5. ^la. 5. ^ohn^.3.
They that have this faith are borne of God and sin not / these that have
this faith do hope and look daily for deliverance out of this thraldom and
body of sin. ^^hn^.3. ^ohn^.2.
And in the mean ceason they purefye the^ self as he is pure. For if a man
will say that he knows Christ or believes in him and keeps not his
commandments he is a liar and we renounce him to be any of this membre that
we speak of And when Rastell says I would conclude there is no hell for them
that be christen me^ though they continue still in sin: I answer he that
commytteth sin is of the deuell / and I say again that the Christen that we
spoke of which are the chylderne of god can not continue still in sin / but
seek all means to fulfill gods commandments. Notwythstondinge the chryste^
which Rastell speaks of which are the chylderne of the deuel may do as they
list / and in dead they hadd nead to make a friend of Rastell to help them in
to his purgatory if it be any better than hell / for they shall never come in
heaven / except they repent and walk innocentlye in this world as christ ^e.
12.
and his lettel flock have ever don^e (for they that walk otherwise are non
of his / though they were myteres. This lyttel flock it is that are so purged
(and not Rastels multitude) and for this is there another hell nor purgatory
ordained / even as for this hepe that continue still in sin is ordained no
heaven. And that there is no hell ordained for these faithful followers of
Christ / I will prove even by this word of Paul why ^he Ra^^ell rehearsed
before. Roma. 8. Romans
That there is no dampnacion to them that be in christ Iesu^yf they leave not
after the flesh. Here Rastell has smite the ball quyte under the cord and
has alleged that / that shall co^dempne him. For if there be no da^pnacion /
but because you are somewhat slow in perceiving the matter I shall reduce it in
to a sillogismus on this manner: maio^
there is no dampnacion unto them that be in christ Jesus if they ^yue not after
the flesh / but after the sprete, mino^
every hell is da^pnacio^ Ergo their is no hell to them that be in Christ Jesus
/ if they live not after the flesh but after the sprete. This is in the
first figure made by celarent / not by any profit that I think that the
poor co^menes can take by such babelinge but only to satisfy your mind and
pleasure. Notwithstondynge one thing I must put you in remembrance / that you
have falslye translated the text for the text has not that condicionall all
thought I was contented to take it at your hands to se what you could prove /
but the text says thus there is is no da^pnacion to them that are in christ Jesu
/ which walk after the flesh but after the sprete: where paul does certify
you that they which are in christ Jesu / walk not after the flesh but after
the sprete / so that you may gather by paull that if they walk not after the
sprete they are not in christ Jesu / that is to say: (...) 8 ^a. 2.
they are no^ of christ's / although Rastell will call the^ christian me^ /
therefore dear brothre^ look that no man deceive hi^ self / for christ is not
the minister of sins. If we be delivered from syn^e through christ / the^ must
we walk in a new conuersacio^ of our life / or else we are still in darkness.
Remember that ma. 6. ^^hn^. 2 ^^lip. 2. (...) 1.
we have this p^cious treasure in frail / brytell and erthye vessels / let us
therefore with fear and tremblinge work our health / and make stable our
vocacio^ and eleccion / for if we retain the truth and knowledge of God in
^^a. 1.
sy^^e and vnryghtwysnes we shall shortly perceive the wrath of god upon us
with infynite delusions / and the end of us shall be worse then the begysiinge:
awake therefore and under stand your health.

Now you may se how he concludes that I establyshe this error / that there
is no hell for saying mine arguments / and Paul Roman. 8. do conclude that
there is no hell / nor dampnacyon to them that are in christ Jesu / and are his
faithful followeres / he thinks it should well follow that if there be no
hell for the^ / that there is no hell for no man: for in his second chaptre
and also in the beginning of the third he says that I deny hell / and when
we come to his probacion / there is nothing said but that which Paul
confyrmeth / that is there is no da^pnacion for them that are in Christ Jesu /
which walk not after the flesh but after the spret which are through christ
without spotte wryncle or blame. And so thought Rastell appear to him self
to conclude like a sage philosopher / yet I answer you he concludes lycke an
ignoraunte sophyster as almen may se / for it follows not: Paul and Frith
say there is no hell / as contrary wise it follows not there is no heaven for
Rastels christen men whych^ continue still in sin ergo there is no heaven for
the deuell there father / and then it is there heaven for Christ and his elect.
I have before declared how Christ's elect are sinners and no sinners. And now
because you should not mistake the textes of S. John^ which I before alleged I
will show you how they doco^mitte synne^ / which I did also sufficientlye
touch in my answer against Rastels dialoge / eue^.ii. leaves from the end /
and yet I will touch it again / because you shall not think that I would not
led you in ygnoraunce and darkness.

There are.ii. parts in a faythefull man which rebel e^he against other and
are at contynuall stryffe and both^ of them have diverse names in scripture /
the one is called the inward man the heart / the mind / the will / and the
sprete / the other is called the outward man the rebellyous members the body
of sin and the flesh / and these in a faithful man keep contynuall war /
and albeit the one be subdued and taken presonner of the other / yet never
consents to his enemy / he can not leave him / neither will make peace with
hi^ / but will labor what he can and will call for all that he thinks will
help him to be delivered from his enemy / and then wareth^ upon him a
fresh. what time the faithful man is brought to the knowledge of god and
believes in christ and has his will and mind / renewed with the sprete of
god that consents to the law of god / that is good ryghtuous and holy and
begins to love the law and has a will and a desire to fulfill the law of
God and not to dispyse his heavenly father and look how much he loves the law
countynge it ryghwys and holy. Even so much doth^ he hate sin which the law
forbiddeth^ and abhorreth^ it in his heart and inward man / and then albe it
the outward man and rebellyous members do at time besege him and take him
captyue under sin / yet doth^ not the inward man consent that this syn^e is
good and the law naught / which forbyddeth it / neither do the the heart
delight in this same syn^e / neither (...) delight in such syn^e because the
sprete of god testifies unto him that it is abominable in the sight of God /
and then fights the inward man against ^he outward with faith^ prayer /
a^mose deeds* and fasting and laboreth to subdue the me^bres ^ame^tinge / that
he has been overcome because ^e ferith to displease god his father / and
desires him for the blood of his sone christ ^that he will forgive that which
is past / and his diligens that he takes in taming his me^bres / is not
recompense toward god for the syn^e that is past / but to subdue the flesh
that he sin no more this rebellion had Paul. Romans 7. Rom
saying / that he did not that good thing which he would / but the evil
which he hated that he did / that is he did not fulfill the good law of god /
as his heart will and inward man desired / but did the evil as touching his
flesh and outward man / which he hated ^^tel^
and so he syn^ed with his outward man / the^ how is this true that he that
commits sin^e is of the deuell / and he that is of god commits no sin /
was not Paul of god: yes verily ^ all be it he commits sin with his
members and outward men / yet be syn^ed not / ^^
for he says If I do that thing that I hate / then is it not I that do it
but the syn^e that dwells in me / and eue^ likewise the faithful followers of
christ commit no syn^e / for they hate it / and if they fortune to be
entangled with syn^e / it is not they that do it (as paul says) but the sin
that dwelleth^ in them which god has left to exercise the^ as he left the
philistines to exercise and nu^tour the children of Israel / and if the
re^nau^tes of sin^e fortune at any time to look a lofte and begin to rain /
the^ he send the so^ cross of aduersite or sickness to help to suppress the^
And thus shall it be as long as we live / but when we be once did / then our
me^bres rebel no more / and then needs neither purpatory nor any other cross
for the outward man is turned in to vanite / and our inward man was ever
(...) 15.
pure through beleuinge the word of god / and never consented to syn^e / and
neadeth another purgatory in this world nor in the world to come / but only
for subduinge the outward man / and therefore after this life he shall never
have any purgatory / mark well what I say and read it again / for more
shall read it then shall understand it / but he that has ears let him hear.

The second error that Rastel lays to my charge is that I would bri^ge the
people in believe that repentance of a man helps not for the remission of his
syn^e.
IN prouinge this second error against me Rastell takes so great pains
that he is almost besides him self. ^^
For he says that I would make me^ believe that it forsith not / whether they
syn^e or no. why so brother Rastel / verily because I allege S. Ioh. S. Paul /
Ezechiell and Hieremye to quench the note fire of purgatory and allege no
auctorityes to prove good works / where unto I answer (as I did before) that it
is nothing to my purpose / for the proving of good works doth^ neither make
for purgatory nor against it / I could have alleged all those textes if I
had intended my self to prove that I should do good works (which I never knew
chryste^ man deny / but as touchi^g my matter it is nothi^nge to the purpose
and as well he might have improued me because I bring in no textes to prove
that the father of heaven is god / or to prove that which never man doubted of
/ notwythstondynge if Rastell had indifferent yies / I spoke sufficientlye of
good works in the.34. argument against his dialoge let all men read the
place and judge.

Rastell takes the matter very grievously Rastell
that I attempt to allege how S. John^ S. Paul send us to christ / and
the^ add that we know no another to take away syn^e but only christ / and
because I add this word only / therefore he thinks that I clean destroy
repentance where unto I answer Frith
that I added not this word only / for naught but I did it by the auctorite
of s. John^ which says: if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have
fellowship with each other and in the blood of Jesus christ his sone purifyeth
us from all sin / whervppon I say that for us which are in the light / his
blood only is sufficient / but for your chryste^ men which continue still in
syn^e and walk in darkness after their father the deuell, must some other
meannes be found or else they shall never enter in to the kingdom of heaven.

But because I will be short let Rastel note that I find.ii. manner of
repentance one is without faith and is such a repentance as Judas and Rastels
christen men which continue still in sin / have at the later end which
does rather purchase the^ an halter then the remission of sins.

An other repentance follows iustificacion and remission of sins and is a
floryshynge fruit of faith / for when by faith we do perceive the favor and
kyndnes that our loving father has showed us in his sone christ Jesus / and
that he has reco^cyled us unto himself by the blood of his sone / then
begin we to love hi^ / the more we hate the body of sin and lament and be
sorry that our me^bres are so frail / that they can not fulfill the law of God
and so in morning and bewailing our infyrmyte / it causes us to abstain
from both / meat and drink and all worldly pleasures which is the pure
fasti^ge that we talk of / but you understand it not: and this repentance
comes not to purge the sins which is committed before / but only takes an
occasion by the sins before committed to know what poison their remained in
our flesh and seaketh^ al means to make us hate this body of sin and to
subdue it with all manner of works that God hath^ appointed to thente^t that it
should in time to come no more displease god our most merciful father which
of gentelnes so often pardons and forgeueth us / as I have touched before.
This is the manner of repe^tau^ce which I find in scripture / but this helps
that we should sin no more / but what Rastell dremethe I woote not. But to
express to the vttermoste what I mean by repentance / mark this example if
a man bylde an house which does cost him much labor and money / and have laid
no ^sure fundacion / but that when a tempeste co^mith his house does fall /
then will he be very sorry / and repent that he has so folishly bestowed his
money and labor. Notwithsto^dinge all this great sorrow and repentance can not
set up his house again which is fallen / but only it takes an occasyon by the
ruin of the house to teach the owner wit against another time that when he
builds again he may make a sure foundation. Even so though^ thou repent
never so much that ca^ not get remission for the sins that is paste / but
that must be pardoned only by the faith of Christ's blood. Nevertheless it
does teach the wytt and learn the to tame thy body and subdue it / and cast a
low fondacion / that in time thou may the better resyste the assautes of
the deuell / the world and the flesh. This does Frith teach of repentance
/ let the world take it as they will / but chyrstes sheep do here his voice.

The third error which Rastell lays aginst me is that I would make me^
believe that they neade to do penance for the satisfaction for their sins.
EVery child may answer him to this if he over read or perceive what I wrote
before of repentance / for as they take repentance for the sorrow and morning
that follows the crime / eue^ so they call penance the good works that
ensue of repentance / and this good works which follow do mortify the me^bres
/ and exercise us in gods commandments that we sin no more / but they
can get no more remission of the syn^e which is once past the^ that which they
call^ repentance and yet do we neither destroy sorowynge for syn^e nor good
works as he falslye reports by us / but we teach you how they ought to be
done and that they are fruytes of faith / and mortifye our members and are
profitable to our neighbor / and a testymony unto us that we are children of
our heavenly fat. as by example I say that another the son^e nor the mon^e do
justify us / or purchase remission of our sins and yet I would not that
Rastel should say that I deny or destroy the son^es the move / for I say it
that without that we can have no day / and that we can not be without the^ /
and as touching the solucio^ of this that penance taking in his largest
significacion / both for good works and taki^g of pains is not satisfaction
for sins / I must tell you once again that there are.ii. manner of
satisfaccio^s / the one is to god / the other to my neighbor. To god can not
all the world make satisfaction for one crime / in so much that if every
grass of the ground were a man as holy as ever was. Paull or Peter and should
pray to god all there life long for one crime / yet could they not make
satisfaction for it / but it is only the blood of christ that has made full
satisfaction unto god / for all such crimes. heb. 7. Hebreo. 7
or else were there no another remedy / but we should al peryshe. There is an
other satisfaction which is to my neighbor who^ I have offended / who^ I am
bound to pacify as we.ii. ca^ agree / and as the laws of the realm determine
between us / as if I had deformed hi^: the^ am I bound to pacefye him and to
restore him to his good name again / if I have morthered any man then by the
laws of the realm I must dye for it to pacifye my neighbor and the comen
welthe / but yet I am sure Rastell is not so childish as to think that this
civil satisfaction is the very satisfaction which pacifyeth gods wrath for
breking his law: for if thou morther a man and should dye a c. times for it yet
except thou have satisfaction of cristes blood thou shall be dampened thereto:
and so I spoke that no temporal pain was instituted of god for thente^t that
we should satisfye gods wrath thereby / as it is plain in my book y^ Rastell
could see.

The fourth error that he layethe against me is that I would persuade the
people that good works are nothing auaylable.
NOw are we come to the fourth error where Rastel untruly reports on me
that I would persuade the people that good works don by any man in this world
is nothing auaylable unto him that does them and that it is no hurt nor
hynderaunce unto any man thought he never do none. Because I say they iustyfye
not before God / therefore he thinks that other men woide understand me as
wyselye as he does / and argue that they are nothing auaylable / but I must
desire him to put on his spectacle / and look again upon my book / and he
shall find these words. Paraduenture thou wylt answer unto me / shall I then
do^o good deades / I answer yes: thou will answer me wherefore? I answer thou
must do them because god has commanded them? I answer thou art lyuinge in
this world with men? and has conuersacio^ with the^ / therefore has god
appointed the what thou shall do to the profit of thy neighbor and ^aminge
of thy flesh / as Paull testifyethe. Ephesi. 2. Ephesi. 2
we are his work in Christ Jesus / unto good works / which works god has
prepared that we should walk in the^ / these works god would have us do that
the unfaithful might see the godly and vertuose conversation of his faithful
and thereby be compelled to glorifye our father which is in heaven. Math. 5.
and so are they both^ profitable unto thy neyygboure and also a testymonie unto
the by the which a man may know that thou art the right son^e of they
heavenly father and a very christ unto thy neighbor: and after teaches that
we ought to do these works without haui^ge respect either to heaven or hell
/ but attendinge through charity the wealth of our neighbor etc.

I wonder, that Rastell is not ashamed to say that I would make the^ believe
that they are not auaylable / therefore good reader note my words / first I say
we must do the^ because god has commanded them / is it not auaylable to keep
the commandments of god: secondaryly I say that they are to the perfyte of
my neighbor: is it not auaylable? therdely I say that they tame our flesh /
is it not auaylable: fourthely I say they are to the glory of god is it not
auaylable. Fiftlye I say they are a testymony to them that does the^ by the
which me^ may know that he is the very son^e of god / is that not awaylable?
belyke Rastell cou^teth nothing auaylable but that which iustyfieth before God
/ he will say the son^e is not auailable because it justifies not / fire is not
auaylable in his yies because it iustifyeth not. etc.

The^ Rastell says that I make a wonders work with the scripture / and
allegeth certain textes that we ought to do good works (which I never denied)
and thervppo^ would conclude that works save and justify / and plaieth me the
bal lustlye over the cord / but as god would there stood a post right in the
way and he hytte it so full / that it made the ball to rebounde over again
backward / for in the alleginge of his purpose Paul says Ephesians. 2. he has
clean lost the game: Ephesi. 2.
the words are these / by grace you be saved by your faith and that is not
of you / it is the gift of god and not of works that no man should glorifye
him sefe / we are the works created of god in christ Jesus which god has
p^p^red that we should walk in the^ / here because he would have the latter
end of the text to serve for his purpose which teaches good works (which I
never denied) he brings in that thing which clean co^futeth his opinion for
his opinion which in all places he has labored to prove / is that we are
saved by good works / but now mark what he allegeth out of Paul by grace you
be saved by your faith: and that is not of you / it is the gift of god and not
of works. For that no man should glorifye him self / here paul says plainly
that our salvation is not of works: and so has Rastell cast don that he
bilt before / and may be likened to a shrowde cow / which when she has
given a large mess of milk torneth it don with her hele.

Thus have I answered to as much of Rastels treatice as I could get / if
there be any more which may come to my hands I shall do my diligence to
disclose his disceyte so that god give me leave to keep the court with him he
shall win but lyttel / except he conueye his balls more craftly / and yet the
truth to say we play not on even hand / for I am in a manner as a man bound
to a post / and can not so well bestow me in my play / as if I were at
lybertye / for I may not have such books as are necessary for me / neither
yet pe^ne / ynke / ne paper / but only secretlye / so that I am in continual
fear / both of the Leuetenante and of my keeper / lest they should espy any
such thing by me: and therefore it is lyttel meruel though the work be on
perfeyte: for when soever I here the keys ringe at the door / strayte al must
be conveyed out of the way (and then if any notable thing hadd been in my
mind) it was clean lost / and therefore I beseech the good reader count it as
a thing borne out of ceason / which for many causes ca^ not have his perfeyte
form and shape / and perdone me my rudenes and imperfection.

Finis.
