To my very loving Brethren the Ministers, and to the Churchwardens, and
Sidemen, of every Parish, and Precinct, within my Archdeaconry of London.
WHereas, for the greater honor, and worship of Gods holy Majesty, it was
anciently ordained in the Church of England, that on Wednesdayes, and Frydayes
weekly, the Ministers, and People, should assemble themselves, in their Parish
Churches, there to offer their humble thankesgiuings, and Prayers, according to
the form prescribed in the Book of common Prayer, established by the laws of
this Kingdom of England: And upon just complaint, of the great neglect of that
religious ordinance, with humble desire of reformation therein; it has pleased
the right reverend Father in God, my Lord Bishop of London, our Diocesan, to
give in charge unto me, that (with all care) I do speedily endeavor that
reformation, within my Archdeaconry, according to the laws, and Canons, in
that behalf provided. I therefore (according to his Lordships charge, imposed
on me) do pray, and require you the Ministers, to give public warning, in your
full Congregations, assembled in your Parish Churches, on the next ensuing
Sunday, (with religious, and zealous exhortations to the same) that every
houshoulder of your Parishes, do duly from henceforth, come in person, or else
send some, or one (at the least) of his Family, to your several Parish
Churches, there to join with you, in thankesgiuings, and Prayers, to Almighty
God, in that holy* and religious manner, commanded in the said Book of common
Prayer; And you the Churchwardens, and Sidemen, or some of you, to be
always present at those weekly divine exercises, whereby you may not only
give good example to others, but also observe those that be negligent, and
admonish them to do their duties therein; And that not prevailing with them, to
present the transgressors unto me, or my Official, who will (to Gods glory)
use the best means of our authority, in reducing the offenders unto the
performance of that Christian duty. And so (heartily desiring your due
consideration of, and care in the premises) I commend you to the grace of the
Almighty. London, this Tenth day of December. An. Dom. 1627.

Your very loving brother, and friend* Tho: Paske.
