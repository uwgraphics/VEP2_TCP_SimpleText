Tho. Berthelet to the reders of this little book.
Read this book / with the other of husbandry
And ye shall find them very profitable
Good / behouefull / and much necessary
To my mind they be right commendable
It is not a jest / a tale / nor a fable:
It is such matter (ye may believe me)
As noble clerks wrote / in old antiquyte.
The worthy Caton / that excellent romayne
Columella / Varro / and Vergilius
Of husbandry to write / had in no disdain
Nor many other / eloquent and famous
Thought it not a thing inglorious
Such matter to write / whereby they might auau^ce
The common welthe. And their country enhaunce.
But in our days / some are blinded so withfolly
That they count husbandry / but a thing right vile
Some had leauer write of love. ye of baudry
Than to so good a matter turn their style
Fond pleasure and pride do them so begyle
That slouthe wandreth about in every way
And good business is falling in decay.
yet nevertheless / good labor to call again
In welthy business / men to exercise
This worthy man / nobly has done his pain
I mean him / that these said books did deuyse
He shows to husbands / in right frutefulwyse
The manyfolde good things / in brefe sentence
Which he has well proved / by long experyence.
And this I leave him / in his good will and mind
That he bears / unto the publyke weal
Would god noble men / could in their hertes find
After such form / for the commons health to deal
It is a true token / of high love and zeal
When he so delyteth / and takes pleasure
By his busy labor / men's wealth to procure.

The prologue of the author / for the declaracyon of this present treatise.
Solomon sapientie Primo. Omnis sapientia virtus / honor / dignitas / et queque
scientia a dn^o deosunt. That is to say: all wisdom virtue / honor / dignyte
/ and cunnyng / are of our lord god. Than sith almighty god our redemer and
creator / by high wisdom / goodness / lyberalite / and prouydence / in this
transitory world and miserable life: Has ordained diverse estates and degrees
in his people and creatures / and some of them: as well has endowed with
goostly and heavenly wisdom and distynke graces / as with great honor /
possessions / and richesse with great gifts and graces / as well spirytuall as
temporal. His high commandment / charge every person that is pertaker of
the said gifts or graces / charritably and discretely / the same to distrybute
and deuyde among his poor creatures / That every poor person that is
willing to labor duly for his living / may have thereby conuenyent help and
susteynaunce. And in as much as the great estates / rulers and governors of
this realm / whom our savior has so largely and bountuously rewarded / with
all such gifts / possessions / and richesse: have according to his pleasure
and commandment / demysed / distrybute / and granted to the creatures of
god. and to their fermours and tenauntes / their several possessions and
inherytaunces / reserving to them for the same certain rentes / customs /
and seruyces / to sustain and uphold their honors and estates / as to them
apertayneth / acordyng to their high gifts and graces / wherewith they be so
largety endowed. And for the great zele / love / and confort that I bear to
the said fermours and tenauntes / and to all other gods creatures: that they
may more surely / easily and profitably increase and sustain their pore
household / wives / and children: and also truly to pay their rentes customs
/ and seruyces unto their lords and the honors of their fermes and
tenauntryce. Of late by experyence / I contryued / compyled / and made a
treatise for the same poor fermers and tena^tes / and called it the book of
Husbandry: the which me seemed was very necessary for husband men that use
tyllage / and for many other of diverse degrees and occupacyons. And where as in
the prologue of the said book I demanded and asked a questyon / and that was
this. Whereunto is every man ordained as plainly it does appear in the
prologue of the same In like manner in the prologue of this treatise / ye which
I entende by the suffrau^ce and help of our lord Jesus / to contryue / compyle
/ and make to the profit of all noble men and women both spyrituall and
temporal / I demand another questyon / and that is this. How and by what
manner / do all these great estates and noblemen and women live and maynteyne
their honor and degree? and in mine opinyon / their honor and degree is
vpholden and maynteyned / by reason of their rentes / issues / revenues / and
profytes that come of their manners / lordshippes / lands and tenementes to
them belongyng. Than it is necessary to be known / how all these manners /
lordships / lands / and tenementes should be exte^ded / surueyed / butted /
bou^ded / and valued in every part: that the said estates should not be
disceyued / defrauded / nor dishe ryted of their possessions / rentes /
customs / and seruyces / the which they have to the^ reserved / for mayn
teynaunce of their estates and degrees. And yt there be no parcel thereof lost
nor imbeselde / and than may the lord of ye said manners / lordshippes / lands
/ and tenementes / have parfyte knowledge where the landelyeth. What every
parcel is worth / and who is his freholders / copyeholders / customarye
tenaunte / or tenant at his will. And what rentes / customs / and service he
ought to have of them / with many moartycles / as here after shall be declared.
Wherefore it is necessary that every great estate / both men and women of
worship / that have great possessions of lands and tenementes / should have a
Surueyour that can extend / but / and bound / and value them. And thereof to
make a book in parchement / bearyng a certain date / after the manner and form
as I shall make an intytulynge / and to amend it where he semethe conuenyent.
Quia facilius est addere quam de nouo facere. That is for to say / It is
lighter to add / refourme / or correct / thanne for to make new and perfyte.
And the Surueyour to leave the said book made by him with his lord in manner of
a regyster / whereunto the same Surueyour or another offycer / may always have
resort / when need shall require to look upon. And that book so truly made /
may be a regyster and sure euydence: that the lord / his freholders / copye
holders / nor tenauntes / shall never lose lands nor rentes / customs / nor
seruyces: but every man that redeth the book / shall perfitely know where the
lands lie / whose it was at the day of the making of the said book / and whose
it is. Than if the owner make a true pee / degree / or co^ueyaunce / by discente
or by purchase unto the said lands or lordshippes. and specially if the names
of the lords and tenau^tes that occupy / might be renewed ones i^ forty or
threscore years. for than it would be as a perpetual and sure euyde^ce for
ever / to put away all strife and varyau^ce between lord and lord / lord and
tenant / tenant and tenant / in good quietness and peace. But of one thing
I pronounce and declare / and take god to my record: that I make this book all
only / to thentent that the lords / the freholders nor their heirs should not
be disheryt / nor have their lands lost nor imbeselde nor encroched by one
from another / and to non other intent. And for that I aduertyse and exorte on
gods behalf / all manner of persons as well lords as other. That when the
lords or freholders / know where their lands lie and what every pasture or
percell is worth by the year. That the lords nor the owners thereof do not
heyghten their rentes of their tenauntes / or to cause them to pay more rent or
a gretter fine / than they have been acustomed to do in time past. For as me
seems / a gretter charity nor alms deed a man may not well do / than upon his
own tenauntes. And also to the contrary / a gretter bribery nor extorcyon a
man can not do / than upon his own tenau^tes / for they dare not say nay nor
yet compain / and therefore on their souls go it that so do and not on mine.
Paraue^ture the lord will say it is not his deed it was his Surueyours / but
that can not be so for saint Augustyne says. Qui per alium facit per seipsum
facere videtur. That is to say: he that commands another man to do a thing
he does it him self. And there be two princypals in one act doing and also
he says. Consenscientes et age^tes pari pena puniantur. That is to say / the
consentours and the doers shall be like punysshed. at grammar scole I learned a
verse and that is this. Dum poteris quid vis possis cognoscere quid sis. That is
to say / when thou may do what thou will / thou may know what thou art.
that is to wit / good or yuell. But for a ground of this treatise the which
I do note / and call it the book of Surueyng and of improuementes / I do take
an old statute named Extenta manerii / as a principal ground thereof: as
herafter ensues.

Explicit.
Of castles and other byldinges / what the walls / tymbre / stone / leed /
sclate / tyle / or other of couerynges is worth: as well within the walls as
without. And also of gardens / curtylages / douehouses / and all other profytes
be worth by the year. etc. Capitulo primo.
INquirend est de castris et etiam aliis edificiis fossates circu^datis qua^tum
muri et edificia ligna et lapidia / plumbo / and alio modo cooperta valent et
pro qua^to appreciari poterunt scdm verum valorem eoru^dem murorum et edificia.
et qua^tum edificis extra fossatis appreciari possunt / et quantu^ valiant vna
cu^ gardinis / curtilagiis columbar / et omnibus aliis exitibus cur per annu^.
This is to say in English. It is to be enquered of castles / and also of
other buyldinges dyched about. What the walls / the byldinges / tymbre / stone
/ leed / and other manner of covering is worth. And how they may be sold /
after the very value of the same walls and bylding. And how much the
bildinges without the dyche may besolde for / and what they be worth / with
the gardens / curtylages / douehouses / and all other issues of the court by
the year. To the declaracyon and constructyon of this statute / me seems there
ought to be made a distynction / for ye statute gothe generally. De castris et
aliis edificiis fossatis et circundatis et extra fossatis. These words go
as well to those castelles and other byldinges that be well vpholden and
inhabyted / as well as of those that be fallen in dekay and not inhabyted / and
to those that be inhabyted. It is not necessary to be exte^ded nor valewed in
any parcel / For let a man make a castle / tower / or any manner of new
buyldinges and finysshe it clearly / if he should go take it down / and selle
every thing by it self again / he should lose the more half of his money.
And therefore in mine opynion / this statute was made soon after the barons
war / the which ended at the bataile of Euessham or soon after / in the time
of king Henry the third / where as many noble men of blood were slain and
many fled / that afterward were attaynted for the treason they did to the
king. and by reason thereof / their castelles and manners were seized in to the
kings hands. And so for want of reparacyons / the castles and the manners fell
to ruin and in dekay. And when the king and his counsel saw that / they
thought it was better to extend them and make the most profit that they
could of them / than to let them to fall to the ground / and come to no
man's help and profit. Wherefore king Edward the first ordained this statute
to be made the fourth year of his raygne / wherein is contained many and diverse
chapiters and artycles / the which at that time was but instructyons / how
and what they should do / that were commyssioners or surueyours in the same.

First it is most necessary and convenient to retayle and to sell every thing
by it self / and not all in gross some to one man and some to another. For
that that is good for one man is not good for another: and every thing to be
praised and sold by it self / that is to say The stone wall of one house by
it self / the tymbre of the same house by it self / the coueryng by it self
/ the tyle / sclate / or leed by it self / the glass by it self. the iron
ware / as bars / bands / hokes / boltes / staples or latches / and all such
other by themself: doors / wyndowes / boordes / and all other things by them
self / and to go fro house to house and sell every thing by it self / and
than shall the true value be best known. And it is conuenyent that these
things be offered to be sold to diverse men and to se who will give most / and
specially to sell when men desire to bye. Also to value what the grass of the
gardens / curtylages / courts / and house places / that be within the dychesse
or without be worth by the year. A curtylage is a little croft or court / or
place of easment to put in catell for a time / or to ley in wood / cole / or
tymbre / or such other things necessary for household. Also to value the
profit of the douehouse if any be there / if it be replenysshed with doves.

How many feldes are of the demeynes / and how many acres are in every field
/ and what an acre is worth by the year. etc. Cap. secundo.
ITem inquirend est quot campisunt in dn^ico and quot acre sunt in campo et
qua^tu^ valet q^libet acra per se per annu^. It is to be inquered / how many
feldes are of the demeyns and how many acres are in every field / and what
every acre is worth by the year. This is a light letter and needs but little
declaracyon / for by these words / quot campi sunt in dn^ico. It must needs be
taken of feldes that be in tyllage or plowyng / but it would be understand /
wheder the demeyne lands lie in the commyn feldes among other men's lands /
or in the feldes by them self. And if they lie in the commyn feldes / it is
conuenyent that they be plowen and sown / and than is not an acre so much
worth as and it were in seueralty enclosed or in several pasture. For and the
field be enclosed about / than it is at the lords pleasure wheder they shall
lie to pasture or to tyllage / and though it lie in tyllage / yet has the
lord the Edysshe and the aftermathe him self / for his own catell. And
therefore an acre is at the more value / and if it lie in pasture the pasture
may be such / that it is at double or treble the value of the errable land.
Wherefore the acres are to be praised according / and if they lie by great
flattes or furlonges in the commyn feldes / it is at the lords pleasure to
enclose them and keep them in tyllage or pasture / so that no another man have
co^myn therein.

How many acres of medowe ar of demeyns and how much every acre is worth /
and to what manner of catell it is most necessary unto and how many beasts it
will find / and what the pasture of a beast is worth by the year. Cap. iii.
ITem inquirendu^ est quot acre parti sunt in dn^ico et quantu^ quelibet acr
valet ad loca^du^ per se per annu^ et adcuiusmodi bestias et ai^a lia pastur
illa fuerit magis necessaria and quot et quales possit sustinere / et quantum
valet pastura cuiuslibet bestie et ai^alis ad locandum per annum. It is to be
enquered / how many acres of medowe ar of the demeyns and how much every acre
is worth to set by the year / and to what manner of beestes or catell it is
most necessary unto / and how many it will find and of what manner / and what
ye pasture of one be is worth by the year. And in mine opinyon / it would
be understand whether the meadows or pastures lie in the common meadows or
common pasture / at large / or in seueraltie: For and it lie at large in the
common meadows / an acre is no better worth than the grass that ye hey is
made of is worth / for after / it is common and of little value. And if it lie
in seueraltie / it is worth half as much again as the grass was worth.
And that high ground and dry / is most conuenyent for sheep / wode ground
and busshe for beestes and specially in winter time. Low grou^des / medowe
grounds / and marsshe grounds for hey and after for fat catell / and in
winter for horses and mares / and mean grounds that is both hylly and dalye
as leyse and low grou^des / is good for all manner of catell if the grass be
good and fine / and specially for fat catell or fat sheep / horses / mares /
and young coltes / for that grass that one manner of catell will not eat
another will. And therefore it is good to have a large close / ye diverse manner
of catell may go together in it / and to know what a beestes grass is worth
by the year / that is as the pasture is that he gothe in is worth / and not
over charged with catell and the fynenesse of the grass and the goodness of
an acre. For some acre of ground is not worth a penny by the year / and some
acre is worth.xl. pens / and so a beestes grass may be dear enough twelfe
pens in the year / and it may be worth.xl. pens or five shillynges / and a
horse grass or a mare grass may be dear enough twelfe pens or twenty pens
by ye year / and it may be worth five shillynges or a noble / according to
the goodness of the pastures. But how these manners / lands / meadows / and
pastures / shall be viewed / butted / bounded / and valewed / shall be rehearsed
after the statute be ones declared.

Of foreign pastures that be commen / how many and of what manner of catell the
lord may have in the same / and what the pasture of a be is worth by the
year. Cap. iiii.
ITem inquirend est de pasturis for inficis que est co^munis quot and quas
bestias ai^alia dominus habere possit in eadem et quantu^ valet pastura per
annum et locand. It is to be inquered of foreign pastures that is co^myn / how
many and what beestes and catell / and what the lord may have in the same /
and what the pastur of a be is worth by the year to set. This is a derke
letter to be well understand without a better declaracyon / for where he
says / De pasturis forinficis que est co^munis. That may be understand three
ways: for there is in many towns / where as their closes and pastures lie in
seueraltie. There is commonly a co^myn close taken in / out of the common or
feldes by tenauntes of the same town / for their oxen or kyen or other catell
/ in the which close every man is stynted and set to a certayntie / how
many beestes he shall have in the same / and of what manner of beestes they
shall be. And if ye lord shall have any catell therein he should be put to a
certayntie and of what manner of catell / and this pasture may be well valewed /
And also the beestes grass what it is worth therein. But than it ought to be
showed how many acres be contained in the said pasture / and what every acre
is worth one with another. Another manner of commyn pasture / is most commonly
in plain champyon countries: where their catell gothe daily before the
herdeman / and lies nighe adioyni^g to their co^myn feldes / and it may lie in
two or three places or mo. and in these it is also conuenyent that every man be
stynted to a certentie / outher by yerdes / lands / oxga^ges rentes / or such
other customs as the tenau^tes use / and the lord in like manner. These common
pastures may be extended how many acres be in every parcel by it self / and
what an acre is worth by it self / but it can not be so well known what a
beestes grass is worth yearly / for they lie most commonly with the falowe
feldes / and some falowe feldes is better than some and so a beestes grass may
be better or worse. The third manner of common pasture / is in ye lords out
wodes that lie common to his tenauntes / as commen mores or hethes / the which
were never errable lands. In these manner of co^mens / me seems the lord
should not be stynted nor set at no certentie / but put his catell upon such
manner of common pasture at his pleasure / because all the whole commen is his
own / and his tenauntes have no certain parcel thereof laid to their
holdynges / but all only bytte of mouth with their catell / and it were
again reason to a bridge a man of his own right. But his tenauntes and every
man's tenauntes / me seems ought of right to be stynted what every manne
ought to have going upon all manner of commens / for else would the rich men
in the beginning of Somer byeshepe and other manner of catell and eat up the
commens / and selle them again at winter / or put them in their pastures
that they have sparedde all the Somerr / and so ouerpresse the poor men that
have no money to bye nor able to reyre.

Of parkes and demeyne woods / the which the lord may assarte and to do his
profit / and how many acres they co^teyne and what the vesture of an acre is
worth / and what the ground is worth when the vesture is fallen. etc. Cap. v.
ITem inquirendum est / de parcis et dn^i cis boscis / que ad volu^tatem suam
possunt assertare / et excolere et quot acre in se contine^tur. Et quantum
vestura cuiustibet acre possit app^ciari / et quantu^ fuudus in se contineat et
valeat quando prostratus fuerit / et quantum valeat quelibet acra per se per
annum. It is to be enquered / of perkes and of demeyne wood / the which at
the lords will may be asserted and plucked up or fallen down / And how many
acres are contained in them / and for how much the vesture of every acre may
be sold / and how much the ground in him self conteyneth when the wode is
fallen / and how much every acre is worth by it self by the year. This is
to be understand / of parkes and demeyne wood that be inseueraltie / whereof
the lord at his pleasure / may assert / stock up by the roots or fall by
the earth / plowe and sow to his most profit as he will / And how many
acres of wood are contained in the same. For in a park or wood may be two
hundred acres and more / and yet not past a hundred acres thereof wood / little
more or little less / and what the vesture / that is to say / the wood of
every acre is worth by him self / for one acre may be worth.xx.s. or.xl.s.
and another acre dear enough.ii.s.vi.s. or.x.s. and how much the whole
ground conteyneth when the wode is fallen / And that is to be understand /
all the ground within pale or hedge / as well the lau^de ground as of the wode
ground where the wood growed / and what every acre is worth by the year / as
well of the one manner as of the other.

Of foreign woods where other men have common / where the lord may improwe
himself thereof and of how many acres / and what the vesture of an acre is
worth / and what the ground is worth when the wood is fallen / and how
many acres they co^tayne / and what an acre is worth. Cap. vi.
ITem inquirendum est de boscis forinsicis vbi alii co^icant / quid de eisdem
boscis dominus se possit approiare / et de quot acris et pro quanto vestura
cuiuslibet acre co^muniter possit appreciari / et quantum fundus valet postquam
prostratus fuerit boscus / and quot acre iste co^tineant / and quantu^ quelibet
acra valet per annu^. It is to be inquered of foreign wodes / where they and
other common together / and what of those wodes the lord may improwe him self
and of how many acres / and for how much the vesture / yt is to say / the
wode of every acre may be sold / and how much the ground is worth after
the wood be fallen down / and how many acres it conteyneth / and what every
acre is worth by the year. The declaracyon of this statute is doutfull /
because of the none certentie thereof / what is sufficyent commen. for it is
clearly ordained by ye statute of Moreton / and after confyrmed by the statute
of Westmynster second. That the lord shall improve him self of their wastes
/ whereby is understand of their common mores / hethes / and wast grounds / as
well as of wodes. Though the statute speak but of woods only leauyng their
tenauntes sufficient commen / the which in mine opinyon be those tenauntes
that have common appendaunt / and hold their lands of him. It is necessary
to be known what is sufficient of commen / and that me seems by reason should
be thus. To se how much catell the hey and the stray that a husband gets
upon his own tenement / will find sufficyently in winter / if they lie in
house and be kept therewith all the winter season / for so much catell should
he have common in Somer / and that is suffycient. ye shall understand that
there be four manner of commens / that is to wit: common appendant commen
appurtenaunt / commen in gross / and commen per cause vicynage.s.
neyghbourshepe. Commen appendaunt / is where a lord of old time has granted
to a man a meseplace / and certain lands meadows / and pastures with their
appurtenaunces to hold of him. To this meseplace / lands / and meadows
belongs commen / and that is called common appendaunt. But and a man grant
to another certain lands or pastures / the which lie in seueraltie enclosed
with the appurtenau^ce in fee / to hold of the chief lords. To these lands
me seems belongs no common / without he have such special words in his
deed. Commen appendau^t / is where a man has had common to a certain nombre
of beestes or without no^bre belongyng to his meseplace in the lords wastes /
this is commen appurtenaunte by prescripcyon / because of the use out of time
of mind. Commen ingrose / is where the lords have granted by their deeds /
commen of pasture to a stranger that holds no lands of him / nor ought to
have any common / but by reason of that grant by deed. Now the lords may
not improve him self of any parcel / for it is contrary to his grant /
though there be sufficyent of commen. And in like case / if the lord grant
commen to a man by deed / and to lymitte him a certain nombre of beestes. Se
what was commen at that time and of that the lord shall not improve him self
/ for and he should / the goodness of the common to that certain nombre
should be abridged that they should not fare so well / and every man's deed
shall be taken stro^gest against him self. And in like manner / if the lord
grant a man commen with his catell / within certain meyres / lymittes / and
bounds / the lord shall not improve him self / within those meyres and
bounds. Common per cause de vicynage / is where the wast ground of two
towneshippes lie toguyder / and another hedge nor pale between to keep their
catell a sonder / so that the catell of one towneshyppe gothe over his meyre or
bound in to the waste ground of the other town / and likewise the catell of
the other townshyppe to them. And also if their commen feldes lie toguyder
unclosed / in opyn time when harvest is in their catell will go out of the one
field in to the other field / and this is called commens / because of
neyghbourshyp / and is not used nor laufull to pynne their catell so going /
but in good manner to drive and chase beside such common. And as for that manner
of commens / me seems the lord may improwe him self of their wast grounds /
leauyng their own tenauntes sufficyent common / having no regard to the
tenauntes of the other towneshyp. But as for all errable lands / meadows /
leyse / and pastures / the lords may improwe them self by course of the
common law / for the statute speaks nothing but of wast grounds. And ye
shall understand / that howbe it that a lord may not improwe him self of
his wast grounds / yet may he laufully fall and selle all the wode / brom /
gorse / fyrs / braken / fern / busshes / thorns / and such other / as fre
stonne / lyme stone / chalk / turues / claye / sand / leed / ore / or tynne /
to his own use: for the tena^tes may have nothing by reason of commen / but
all only bytte of mouth with their catell. And ye shall know / that swyne
and Geese have no commen / but by suffraunce / without special words in their
charter. Also the lord shall have his free warren / for all manner beestes and
fowls of warren in his wast grounds / as well as in his several grounds.
and as long as the beestes or fowls of warren be upon the lords ground /
they be the lords if he have warren / and the lord may have an actyon of
Trespace against any man that chaceth or kylleth any of them in his commen /
as well as in his several. And if they go or fly out of the lords warren /
than is the property changed / and the lord has lost his actyon for taking
of them when they be out of his warren / without they come in to his warren
again. there is no man has warren but by special grant of the king by
charter / except it have been used time out of mind / and allowed before justice
in heir. And as for the articles contained in this present chapter the letter
thereof is plain enough / and also touched before.

Whether the lord may give or selle the resydue of his foreign woods / and
what such gift or sale is worth by the year. etc. Cap. vii.
ITem inquirendum est / vtrum dominus de residuo boscorum predictorum /
forinsicoru^ dare possit / et quantum valet huius donationis et venditionis per
annum. It is also to be enquered / wheder the lord may give or sell the
resydue of his foreign woods aforesaid and what such gift or sale is worth
by the year. This letter is plain enough / and as me semethe no doubt / but
that the Lord may give or selle the resydewe of the said woods or wastes /
Except that a man have commen of Estouers / But what that gift or sale is
worth. it is to be understand and known and as me seems the donee or the
byoure / shall be in like cause as the lord should have been if he had not given
it nor sold it. Than the lord has i^proued him self of as much wodes and
wastes as he can laufully and when he has given or sold the resydue of that
he can not improve him self of. in like manner the donee nor the byour can
not improve them self of any part thereof / For they can not be in no better
case / than he of whom they had it. how be it that they that of right ought
to have their commens be not their tenauntes / but their tytell and interest
grew by enherytaunce / long time before the gift or sale made by the lord.
And it follows by reason / that the gift or sale of a stranger shall not hurt
another man's enherytaunce. But this donee or this purchasoure / shall take to
their profit all the vesture standing upon / or being with in the said ground
/ as woods and such other: as is said before in the next chapter.

Of panage and herbage of the town / and of all other profytes of pooles /
meyres / and rynnynge waters / of moors / heythes / and wastes / what they be
worth by the year. etc. Cap. viii.
ITem inquirendu^ est de panagio herbagio ville / et omnibus aliis exitibus
viuarioru^ morarum bruerum et vastorum quantum valent per annum. Also it is to
be inquered / of panage herbage of the same town / and of all other profytes
of polles / meyres / and rynnyng waters / of mores / hethe and wastes / what
they be worth by the year. And where this Statute speaks / de panagio / that
is to be understand. Whan^e there is any mast growyng in ye lords wodes /
whereby me^nes swyne may be fed and releued / what profit that may be to the
lord. For there is no man that can claim of right / to have the mast the
which is a fruit / but the lord: except his free tenant have it by special
words in his deed. Quod sit quietus de panagio. And the lord shall have it in
his foreign out wodes / as well as in his parkes or several wodes / and as the
quantite of the mast is / so the lords baylye of right ought to ley me^nes
swyne thereunto from Myhelmas to Martylmas / and to make a true account thereof
at the lords audyte / what he takes for every swyne. And in many places the
tenauntes go fro panage in the foreign wodes by custom / and that is most
commenly where as the tenauntes pay tacke swyne by custom / if he have to a
certain nombre / or else to pay yearly at Myghelmas.i. d. or an halfpeny for
every swyne / as the custom is used. The statute speaks / De herbagio ville.
That is to be understand of the commen pasture that belongs to the town /
whereupon the herdman keeps the tenauntes catell / It may be so good that the
tenauntes need not to have any several pasture / but that their common pasture
should be able to find all their catell / both horses / mares / beestes / and
sheep / and so it was of old time that all the lands / meadows / and pastures
/ lay open and unclosed. And than was their teneme^tes much better chepe than
they be now / for the most part of the lords have enclosed their demeyne
lands and meadows / and keep them in seueraltie / so that their tenauntes have
no co^myn with them therein. And also the lords have enclosed a great part of
their waste grounds and streytened their tenauntes of their co^myns therein.
and also have given license to diverse of their tenauntes to enclose part of
their errable lands / and to take in new intackes or closes out of the
co^mens / payeng to their lords more rent therefore so that the common pastures
waxen less / and the rentes of the tenauntes waxen more and more. And that is
because the tenauntes waxen more polytike in wisdom to improve their
tenementes / holdynges / and fermes: and at the end of the ferme / another man
that made no cost of the said improuement / offers the lord certain money
for a fine to have it or to heghten the rent of the same / so that he that made
the cost or his children shall not have the said ferme / without he will give
asmoche or more as is offered to ye lord / and so through the envy of his
neighbor and the couytousnesse of the lord and his officers / the pore tenant
has a great loss or else utterly undone / god amend it. And the lords have a
gretter loss than they wene for their tena^tes se how their neyghburs yt have
bylded their houses / improued their lands and be put out except he make a
fine or pay more rent. Causes the^ another to bylde nor otherwise to improve
their holdi^ges / to the lords great loss at length. And where ye statute
says / de oi^bus aliis exitibus viuarioru^ moraru^ brueru^ et vastorum. and of
all profytes that shall come of the lords sta^dyng waters / mores / hethe and
wastes. viuariu^ is a pole or a meyre that fisshe increases and lives in.
Some rynni^g waters be as fre and several to the lords / as their pooles /
meyres / or standing waters. And as they be stored with fysshe / so does ye
profit rise to the lords / wheder they go by way of improuement or set to
ferme: whereof the bailey shall make account. Moors / hethe / and wastes / go
in like manner as the herbage of the towns / for the lords tenauntes have
commen in all such out grou^des with their catell / but they shall have no
wode / thorns / turues / gorse / fern / and such other / but by custom or
else special words in his chartour. etc.

Of mylnes / several fysshinges / and commen fysshyng / what they be ^orthe in
the year. Cap. ix.
I Item de mole^dinis / piscariis seperalibus / et co^ibus quantu^ valent. Also
of mylnes / several fysshinges / and common fysshinges / what they be worth.
In this short article many things ar to be remembered / for where he says de
mole^dinis / ye which is in the plurell no^bre / it is to be understand /
that there be many manner of mylnes as cornemylnes / wyndmylnes / horsemylnes /
and quernes that go with hand. Fullyngmylnes / sithe mylnes / cutlersmylnes /
smethymylnes / and all such other as the whele gothe by drifte of water to
blow the bales or to dray any water like a pomp / as there be in Cornwall and
diverse other places. Though they be no mylnes properly to grynde corn / yet it
is a profit to be lord / the which a surueyour may not forget to put in his
book and to but and bound them as they lie / and who be the fermours and what
rentes they pay. And to the cornemilnes to the most part of the^ belongs
Socone / that is to say / custom of the tenauntes to grynde their corn at
the lords mylne / and that is as me seems / all such corn as grows upon
the lords ground that he spe^deth in his house. But and he bye his corn in
the market or other places / he is than at liberty to grynde where he may be
best served / that manner of grynding is called love Socone / and the lords
tenauntes be called bond socon. And if they grynde not their corn at the
lords mylne / ye lord may a merce the^ in his court / or else he may sue them
at the commen law. De secta molendim facienda. But when he shall make his
declaracyon in ye debet and when in the solet / I remytte that to men of law
that have experience thereof. It is also to be known how the tole should be
taken / but there be so many diverse grau^tes made by the lord / some men to be
grou^den to the twenty part / and some to the.xxiiii. part / tenant at will
to the.xvi. part / and bondmen to the.xii. part / some men to be tole free /
and some to be hopper fre / that is to wit: that his corn shall be put into
the hopper and ground next to the corn that is in the hopper / at the time of
his coming. And in some place to take the tole after the strength of the water
/ that follows by reason. for that mylne that has a bygge water and may
drive a great broad stonne / the which will make much more meyle / than that
mylne that gothe with a little stone / he is much better worthy to have the
more tole / and yet shall the honer of the corn have the more profit. And so
there be so many dyuersities of taking of tole / that I will not take upon me
to tell how / but also to remytte it to men of law to show the dyuersities.
But dout ye not / the mylners will be no losers / and of mylnes there shall more
be spoken of in the chapter of waters / among the improwmentes / De piscariis
seperalibus that is to be understand / in the lords standing waters / as
pooles and meyres: and also rynninge waters that be several / as be very many
in diverse countries / set to ferme from one place of the river to another for
certain rent / and if any man fysshe in the lords pooles or meyres / the
lord may have his accyon upon the statute of Westmynster prim^. And if he
fysshe in the rynning and several waters / the lord may have his actyon at
the common law / and in likewise the lords tenant / if any man fysshe in his
ferme hold / be it standing waters and rynninge waters: And where he says /
de omnibus / of commen fysshynges / that is little profit to ye lord but to
his tenau^tes / except he dwell nighe the sea / and will cause his servant to
fysshe there for him / for yt is the best common water yt any man can fisshe
in. And somerynning waters be common / as little brokes / and sytches / and in
some rinnyng waters / the lords tenau^tes have liberty by custo^e to fysshe
with shouenettes / trodenettes / small pytches / and such other.

Of fre tenauntes / the which dwell without as well as within. etc. Cap. x.
ITem inquirendum est de libere tenentibus quibusque forinsecis et
extri^scicis. Also it is to be enquered of fre holders / the which dwell
without as well as wtin. By this letter it is to be vnderstan^e / that a free
holder may dwell out of the precyncte of the lords manner / and yet hold his
land of the said manner* For one manner may stretche in to diverse shyres / as
the honer of Tutebury / Walyngeforde / Pountfrette / Tyckell / and such other:
And in that cause the lord of the honer or manner / may take a distress for
his rentes / homages / relifes / customs and seruyces / and to bring the same
dystresse out of that shyre where it was taken / in to that shyre where the
manner is / of whom these said lands be holden. And if the tenant will sewe
repleuy / the sheriff where the catell is shall make and serve the repleuy / and
not the sheriff where the goods or the catell was taken / nor return upon his
repleuy / quoth aueria elongata su^t And the lord may have a fre holder that
holds his land of him / and pays him chief re^tes and other service / and
not by the reason of any manner. As thus / a man purches a parcel of land
before the making of the statute / quia emtores terrarum. And give the same
lands again to a stranger before ye making of the said statute / to hold of
him by certain rent and service. This may be called a foreign fre holder / for
it is no parcel of any manner / and it is no manner it self* For to every
manner belongs two things / that is to say^ parcel in demeyne and parcel
in service. That is lands in demyne belongyng to the manner and service /
customs / or re^tes / and this free holder / I spoke of before has demeyne /
but he has no service. Also a man may have both rent and service of a
freholder / and yet he holds not his lands of him that he pays his chief
rent unto. As and a man purches lands sithe the making of the said statute /
and give it to a stranger / reseruyng fealty and certain rent: this free
holder holds his lands of the chief lord next above. and yet shall he pay
his rentes and services reserved to him that gave it to him / and if the gift
were in the tail and no remaynder in fe ever / now the reuercyon rests
still in ye donor. I could speak more of the gifts and remaynders / but I
remyt the^ to men of law that be learned / for it is not the matter that I
entende to speak of. How be it / it is very necessary for every Surueyoure to
have insyght and experyence of the common law / or else at some season he shall
disceyue his lord or his tenant / and specially his own soul / for saint
Isodorus says. Quoth ignora^tia crassa vel affectata non excusat peccatu^. That
is to say / ignorance of conning or of the faculty in him yt takes upon him
as a master or techer of the science or co^nyng / excuses not a man's
offense. for every man that god gath send wit and reason unto / is bounden
to know / wheder he do well or yuell. And therefore it is necessary / that
every man learn and do his dilygence / to know what he ought to do / or he
take upon him / any such office or rowme.

Who be fre tenauntes and what lands and tenementes and what fees they hold
and by what service / wheder by socage or by knight service or other / and what
rent of assyse they give by the year and who holds by charter and who by
Au^cyent demeyne / and who by new feoffement. Cap. xi.
ITem inquirendum est qui sunt liberi tenentes / et qui et quas terras et
tenementa / et que feoda teneant / et per quod seruicium / vtrum per soccagium
/ vel per seruiciu^ militare / vel alio modo / et quantum reddant per annum de
redditu Assise / et qui tenent per cartam / et qui non / et qui per antiquam
tenuram et qui per nouum feoffamentum. Also it is to be enquered / who be fre
tenauntes and what manner lands and tenementes / and what fees they hold and
by what service / and wheder it be by socage or by knight service or of any
other manner and what they yield by the year of rent of Assise / and who holds
by charter and who not / and who by the old tenur / and who by the new
feoffement. It apereth by this article / yt there be many manner of fre holds /
and hold their lands and teneme^tes in diverse manner / and by many manner of
rentes / customs / and seruyces / as tenauntes in fee simple / tena^tes in
tail tenantes by copye of court role / tenauntes by the curtesy / tenauntes in
dower / and tenauntes for term of life by special grant / and many other.
And all these tenauntes may hold their lands by diverse tenures / customs /
and seruyces: as by homage / fealty / escuage / socage / knight service /
grant sergentie / petyte sergentie / frank almoyne / homage / auncetrell /
burgage / tenures / and tenure in vyllenage. But to declare the dyuersytie of
all the tenures / it would be to long a process / and therefore I remytte it
to the first book of the common law / called the tenures. But ye diuersytie of
these tenures / what rentes / fees / customs and services / the lord ought to
have of his tenau^tes can not be known but by the lords euydence / court
rolls / rentayles / and such other presyde^tes / and specially by the
original deeds of their tenauntes. And ye shall know / yt the lords may not
distreyne their tenauntes nor cease their lands in to their hands / to cause
their tenantes to show their euydence / whereby they hold their lands. But
and the lord have any euydence / rentayles / or court rolls / or any manner of
rentes / customs / and service that he has not and can prove a possessyon of
the same in his auncesters / sithe the lymitacyon expressed in the statute of
Westmynster second in the second chapter / than he may laufully distrayne
for the same. And than must the tenant show a discharge by suffycient writing
/ and not by words / or else to pay the same: for matter in writing / may not
be discharged by a new de paroll.s. bare words. The statute speaks / qui
tenent per cartam / et qui non. The tenauntes in fee simple and the tenauntes
in tail / that have evidence and deeds made and sealed / and possessyon
delivered of their lords or by their attorney / from one to another / they
hold their lands by charter / be it new made or old. And also there be
tenauntes in fee simple / and tenau^tes in tail / that hold by no charter /
and those be tenauntes by copye of court role. As and a lord have a manner /
and within the said manner there is a custom that has been used time out of
mind / that certain tenauntes within the said manner have used to have their
lands and tenementes / to hold to them and to their heirs / in fee simple /
fee tail / or for tme of life at the will of the lord / after the custom of
the manner. and such a tenant may not give nor selle his land by deed / for
and he do / the lord may enter as in lands forfayte to him. For if such a
tenant will give or sell such manner of lands to another / he must surre^dre
the same lands in the lords court in to the lords hands / unto the use of
him that should have it: or in fee simple / fee tail / or for term of life.
And he that shall have the land / must come into the court and take it of the
lord / as here after follows.

common law. Plegii de prosequend GF. et GH. but how the declaracion / the
answer / replicacion / and reioyndre should be made: and also in actions of
debt / detinue / c^uenauntes / trespass / and such other / I remyt yt to men
of law yt have expeience thereof. but one thing wotte I well / yt many an
erroneous process the stewardes make in their court rolls. Wherefore men of
honor and of worship / and abbottes / priours / and such other should make
men of law their stewardes / and to cause them to exercise the office him
self with his clerk / sufficiently instructed by his master / that there may
be made due proves without favor / bribery / or extorcyon / on pain of
forfeyture of his office. But it is a common use in some countries: that lords
/ knights / esquyers / and gentylmen / that know but little of the law be
made stewardes / and they come to the court or send their clerks / that can
as little law as their master or less: but that he understands a little
laten. And if there be a fine to make for a tenement / house / or close / that
is to be set: the steward shall have a reward for his good will / that he
may have it before another man / and the clerk must have another reward for
to entreat his master to the same / so that the lords fine must needs be the
less / or else the poor man shall be at a great charge. Whereof speaks Solomon /
prouerbiorum.xvii. Melius est parum cum iustitia / quam multi fructus cum
iniquitate. It is better to have a little rightwisely / than to have much
profit wickedly. But now to my matter that I spoke of before / there may be
in one manner or lordshyp both charter land and copyelande / and each of the^
well known from other / and one man may have and hold them both. Also there
be other tena^tes by copy of court role / and is called tenauntes perle
virge.s. by the yerde. And they be called so / because when they would
surrendre their tenementes in to the lords hands to the use of another / they
shall have a little yerde in his hand by custom of the court / and that he
shall deliver unto the steward / if he be there present / or to the bailey or
reave / or to other two honest men of the lordeshyp. And at the next court he yt
shall have the said lands shall take it in the court / and his taking shall be
entered in the role / and the steward or bailey as the customs is used / shall
deliver to him yt shall have the land the same yerde / or another in the name
of season / and has non other euyde^ce but ye copy of ye court role and it
may be made in fee simple for fee tail or for term of life / And all manner
of customs that be not again reason may be admytted and a lowed for a
custom. And how be it that these manner of copye holders have an estate of
enherytaunce / after the custom of the manner / yet have they no frank
tenement because of the common law / and therefore they be called tenantes of
base tenur. Mesemeth it were necessary and co^uenyent / to show diverse
dyuersites how copyes should be made / for fere lest every man that takes
upon him to keep a court / has not perfitelye thexperyence thereof / as
herafter enseweth.

First of surrenders of lands holden by the yerde.
HE shall take a yerde in his hand by the end / and deliver the steward the
other end in his hand / and say to the steward. Here I A.B. do yield up or
surrendre my lands that called D. the which I hold of this lordeshyp at the
lords will / after the custom of this manner / to the behoue of Johan Brown
and his heirs.

How the steward shall deliver season.
The steward shall deliver him an end of the yard in his hand that shall
have this land / and he shall say thus to him. My lord grants you season
of this land that was A. B. the which ye have take here in the court to you
and to your heirs / to hold at my lords will / after the custom of this
manner / and than he shall be sworn. etc.

The manner of the oath of the tenant.
I shall bear faith and truth to my lord of this manner / as for the
lands and tenementes that I have taken of him / and truly do and pay the
suits / customs / rentes / and seruyces that longs thereto / as for ye term
that I shall ocupy it / so help me god. etc. and kiss the book and ley
down.i. d. as the custo^e is.

customs / and seruyces / in their copyes. And that is in ancient demeyne /
and in all places where their tenau^tes have their lands by copye to them and
their heirs / after the custom of the manner. for there they have or ought to
have a customarie role / wherein is every man's land contained / and what rent
/ customs / and seruyces every man ought to pay and do / and in many places /

and therefore the rentes must always be expressed. Also where a man has a

copy of court role for term of years or for tme of life where they have no
state of inherytaunce. In all such copyes / it is conuenyent that the rentes

MEmorandum that there is no manner of estates made of free land by polle deed
or deed inde^ted / but like estates may be made by copye of copye lands / if
they be well made and entered in the court rolls. And the steward is bound
by law and conscience to be an indyfferent judge between the lord and his
tenauntes / and to enter their copyes truly in the lords court rolls / the
which is a regester to the lord to know his presydentes / customs / and
seruyces / and also a great surety to the tenantes / that if their copies were
lost / they may vouche and resort to the lords court rolls / and the steward
may make them new copyes / according to the old presydent in the lords
court role / like as at the commen law / when a matter in varyau^ce between two
men is past by verdyt / and judgment given thereof / and entered in the kings
records / there it rests of record. and also if a deed or a patent be
enrolled / there it remeyneth of record in like manner. so yt if any party
will have any copye thereof / they may sue to the judges and the officers of
the place where the record lies / and have a copye thereof exemplyfied under
the seal of office of the same place / where such record lies / and may
plede the same record in every court the king has / and the lords steward
may do in like manner. etc.

The oath of all manner of officers generally.
To whom the steward shall say / ley thy hand upon the book and say after
me / I shall true constable be / true thridborowe / true reave / true
frankelege / true tythingman / true ale taster / true wodewarde / and true
pynder / with such other officers that be used to be sworn in ye lords
court / and true prese^tment make / and truly and duly do and keep all
things that belongs to mine office to do / so help me god and my holydome /
and kiss the book.

The oath of a denysen.
I shall true liegeman be / and true faith bear to king Henry that now is /
and to his heirs / and no trayson do / nor thereunto assent / nor no theft do
/ nor no thieves fellow be / nor any of them to know / But that I shall inform
and do to wit them that be the kings officers thereof that have ye law to
govern. and I shall be buxome and obeydient to justices / co^myssioners /
sheriffs / exchetours / baylyes / and constables / and to all other officers
of the kings in all things that they command me to do laufully / so help
me god and halydome. etc.

The oath of afferoure.
I shall truly affere this court / and high no man for no hate / ne low no
man for no love / but to set every man truly after the quantite of his
trespace to my knowledge / saving to a gentylman his counteynaunce and his
householde / a machaunt his marcha^dyse / a husband his tenure and his work
beestes to his ploughe / so help me god and my holydome.

This article gothe farther. Et quantum reddant per annum de redditu assise.
And how much they yield by the year of rent of assise. And first ye shall
know / that there be three manner of rentes / that is to say: rent service /
rent charge / and rent seek. Rent service / is where a man holds his lands
of his lord by fealty and certain rent / or by homage / fealty and certain
rent / or by any other service and certain rent. This is a re^t service / and
if the rent be behind at any day yt it ought to be paid at / the lord may
distreyne for that rent of common right / and if the lord purchase parcel of
the said land that the rent gothe out of / ye rent shall be apporcyoned: except
it be an entter rent / as a sperhauke / or a horse / or such other that can
not be severed / for than the rent is extinct and gone for ever. etc. Rent
charge / is where a man is seized of lands in fee and grant by poole deed or
by deed indented* Annuell rent going out of the same lands in fee or in fee
tail or for term of life / with a clause of dystresse that is a rent charge /
and the grau^tee may distreyne for the same rent / because of the clause of
dystresse. But if the grant purchase parcel of ye said lands / whereof the
said rent gothe out / the hole rent charge is extynct and gone for ever. For
such a rent charge may not be apporcioned / because the lands come to his
own possession by his own act or deed Rent seek / is where a man is seized
of lands in fee grant / a rent going out of the same without a clause of
distress / that is a rent seek and it is called a re^t seek / because there
is no distress insedent nor belo^gyng to the same. Also if a man by deed
inde^ted make a feoffement in fee or in fee tail / the remayndre over in fee
or for term of life remeyner over in fee / reseruyng to him certain rent
without any clause of distress in the same. That is a rent seek / and if the
grant were never seized of the said rent / he is with out remayndre by course
of the common law. There is another manner of rent: that is another rent service
/ rent charge / nor rent seek / and that is called rent annuell. And that is /
where as a man grants by his deed / an annuitie of.xx.s. be it more or less
/ and charge no land with the payment of the same. That is a rent annuell /
and it charge the person that grants the said rent by a writ of annuite
/ and in some cause a rent charge / may become an annuell rent. as and a man
grant a rent charge out of his land with a clause of dystresse / the grant
is at liberty / wheder he will distreyne for the rent / or sewe a writ of an
nuyte against the graunter. And if he sewe his writ of annuyte / the land is
dyscharged of any distress. and therefore the grauntour may make a prouycion
in his grant.s. prouiso semper / quod presens scriptum nec aliquid in eo
specificatum non aliqualiter se extendat ad onorandu^ personam meam per breue /
vel actionem de annuite. sed tantu^modo ad onorandu^ terras / et tenementa
predicta de annuali redditu predicto. And this prouyse had / the lands be
charged and the person discharged.

Of those free tenauntes that sewe to the court of the county / and who
seweth not / and how much falls to the lord after the decesse of such
tenau^tes. Cap. xii.
ITem inquirendum est de predictis libere tenentibus et qui secuntur / ad cur
ad com^ in co^mitatu / et qui non / and quantum accidit domi^o post mortem
taliu^ liberorum tenentium. It is to be enquered of the foresaid free tenauntes
/ which of them shall follow the court of the county and which not / and
what shall fall unto the lord / after the death of such free tenauntes. Me
seems that all manner such tenau^tes that hold their land by such service
having charter land / ought to follow the court of the county / if he be
somoned to appear / except he have a special grant by chartour / of the king
to the contrary. and to be sworn in inquyries before the justice of peace /
justice of assise / excheters / coroners / and all other co^missyoners of the
kings / and bitwene party and pertie as the law has ordained it. howbeit in
some case he shall dispende and have more lands than in some case. that is to
say / if the damage in plee personell: as debt trespass / detynue / and such
other / be declared under the value of.xl. marks. Than a freholder that has
any charter land / be it more or less / may pass between party and party.
And also he is sufficyent to enquere for the king in every byll of indytement /
of felony / and so is every constable and freman / though he have no land. But
there shall no constable nor fre holder enquere of riot nor forcyble entrees /
without he may dispende.xl.s. clearly. and therefore se the statute of king
Richard the.ii. and king Henry the.vii. and also where the domages in plee
personell de declared.xl. marks. or above / the freholder must have lands to
ye clear value of.xl.s. And every man that shall pass of life and death and
for tytell of land be it never so little / he mua^st have ldes to the value
of.xl.s. clearly above all charges. And in atteynt / if the thing in demand
and verdyte upon that given / extend to ye value of.xl. li. or above. Than
every man of the grant jury / must have lands to the value of.xx. li. of
freholde / out of ancient demeyne. and of lands in Gauelkynde.xx. li. and if
it be under the value of xl. li. than.xl.s. of freholde is suffycient. The
statute reherseth further. Quid et quantum accidit dn^o post mortem talium
libere tenentium. What and how much falls to the lord / after the death of
such fre tenauntes / That is and may be / diverse manners of rentes / customs
/ and seruyces / As and a tenant hold of ye lord by knight service decesse /
his heir being of full age / the lord shall have for every knights fee that
the tenant holds of the lord. C. s. of his heir in the name of relefe. For
the which the lord may distreyne in every percell of that land that is so
holden of him for the same / of common right. And if it be under a hole
knights fee / as half a kynghtes fee / the third part / the fourth part /
or the.xx. part more or less / the relefe shall be apporcyonate / according to
the same / and shall pay his chief rentes if any be nevertheless. And if the
tenant decesse / his heir being within age of.xxi. years / the lord shall
have ye ward and the keeping of the body during his nonage / and if he be
unmarried / than his marriage to give or sell to whom he will without
dispargement / and when he comes of full age / he shall pay no relefe. and if
he be married and under the age of.xiiii. years / he may refuse and disagre /
but how the garden or his commytte or grant shall tend / and offer marriage
to the ward / and if the ward refuse the offer / or if the ward be rauysshed
and of wards because of wards / and of dispargementes of wards / and
disagrementes after marriage / and of wast done by the garden / or his committee
or grant / with mo artycles parteynyng to the same. I remytte all those
points to men of law that have knowledge and experience thereof / for it
touches not my matter that I treat of. and if the tenant have issue female /
above the age of.xiiii. year / be she married or not married / the lord shall
not have the ward ne the marriage / because the law entendeth yt she has a
husband or may have a husband at that age / able to do such service. But
and the heir female be under the age of.xiiii. years unmarried / the lord
shall have both the lands holden of him and ye marriage / till she come to the
age of.xiiii. years / and two years further to tend her marriage in / if she be
unmarried. and at the two years end / she may enter in to her lands and put
out her garden / and to marry her self at her pleasure. but and she be married
before the age of.xiiii. years in the life of her au^cestr / and than her
auncestr dye / the lord shall have ye ward of the land to the age of.xiiii.
years / and than her husband and she may enter and put out the lord / and
if the tenant hold of two lords by knight service / of one by priorite and
of another by posteryorite and dye / the lord that the tenant holds of by
priorite / shall have the ward of the body / be it heir male or heir female
/ though there be three or four daughters / for all they are but one heir to
the lands that beholden of him. And the other lord of whom the lands be
holden of by posteryorite / shall have those lands holden of him self / and
nothing else. And if the tenant hold lands of one lord by knight service /
and also hold lands of another lord by soccage and dye / his heirs being
within age / the lord of whom the lands be holden of by knight service /
shall have the ward and marriage of the heir and the lands holden of him /
but he shall not have the lands holden in socage / nor the lord of whom they
be holden of / another / For those lands holden in socage during the nonage /
shall go to the next of the blood / to whom the enherytaunce may not discende /
whereof he shall make acompt unto the heir when he comes of full age etc. And
if the heir be of full age at the decesse of his auncestre / he shall pay a
relefe to every lord that he holds any land of / if relefe be due to be
paid / by reason of his tenure. But in case that a tenant hold diverse manours
of diverse lords by knight service and have but one parcel of land holden of
the king in capite / the king shall have all the hole lands holden of every
lord / during the nonage: and the marriage of ye heir if he be unmarried. and
if the heir be under the age of.xiiii. year and will dysagre to the marriage /
than the king shall have the marriage of him or her / or the value thereof. and
the king shall pay no chief rent during the nonage / except it be found due
to be paid in the office of therchetour. and many other things may fall to
the lords as herryottes and other customs / according to their origynall
deeds / and use of the manner. And ye shall understand / that there be two
manner of herryottes: that is to wit / herryot service and herryot custom.
Herryot service / is where a man has given lands and teneme^tes to another
man and to his heirs / to hold of him and of his heirs / as before the
making of the statute / Quia emptores terrarum / or sithe ye making of the
said statute to hold of ye chief lord of the fee / by the service thereof due
and of right accustomed / reseruyng to him certain rentes / herryottes / or
any other custom. This is rent service and herryot service / because it is
expressed in his origynall deed. Herryotte custom is where a man has a
lordship / wherein has been used time out of mind / that every tenant that
holds any mese place of ye lord / shall give his best quycke good in the
name of a herryotte to the lord / and he that has no quick good / shall give
his best deed good. And in some place the tenant shall give for every mese
place yt he holds a herryot / though the houses were let down an hundred
year before / the which me seems should be a great bribery and extorcyon / as
I said in the prologue of this treatise. And therefore it is wisdom for every
man to take his house by indenture or by copye / wherein may be expressed: what
rentes / herryottes / customs / and seruyces the tenant shall pay and do /
for a lord may abridge and make less his custom by writing. but though he
make writing and specifye what rent he shall pay / he must say further / for
all manner rentes / herryottes / customs / and seruyces. And in some
lordeshyppe / every man that dies within the same / be he the lords tenant
or not / shall pay an herryotte. In so much that if a strange man ride or go
by ye way and dye within such a lordshyppe / he shall pay an herryot / the
which is plain extorcyon and against the commen right / For between the lord
and him that dyed / there was no manner of priuyte of bargayn or couynau^t. And
in some lordshyppe / the lord shall take his herryotte before the person / or
the vycare his mortuarye / and in some places the church before / And that is
/ as it has been accustomed and used time out of mind. But for the most part
/ the lord takes before: because the lord makes couynaunt with his tenant
in his life / that he shall have his best quycke good at his decesse / and the
mortuary is not due till he be deed / and the herryotte was couynaunted and
granted before in his life / and the first bargayne must be observed and
kept. And also in some places it is parted between the church and the lord /
and that is / where he that is deed has no moore quycke good / but one horse
or one be / and tha^ he that has be used to chose first / shall have ye
better part by one penny / but of deed good / either party shall have one But
there shall another of them take any deed good / as long as there is any quycke
goods / and in many lordshyppes / it is used / that and the tenant leave his
house by his own will / without any discharge of the lord / ye tenant shall
pay his best quick good to the lord in the name of an herryot. and in some
lordshippes it is acustomed / that and the tenant deperte fro ye lordshyp by
his own will / he shall make a fine with the lord for his depertyng / and
most commonly it is.ii.s. and it is called a farefee or a farewell. And such
a tenant that gothe at his own will shall make all manner of reparacyons / and
that tenant that is dyscharged by the lord or by his officers / shall make no
reparacions / except he be discharged for not doing reperacions. etc.

How many customary tenantes there be / and how much lands every of the^
holds / and what works and customs they do / and what the works and the
customs of every tenant is worth by ye year and how much every of the^
pays / over the customs and works. etc. Cap. xiii.
ITem inquirend est de custumariis videlicet quot sunt custumarii / et quant
rerre qui libet custumarius teneat / quas operatio^es quas consuetudines facit
/ et quantu^ valent opera et consuetudines cuiuslibet custumarii / per se per
annum et quantum redditum de redditu assise per annum preter opera and
consuetudines / et qui possunt talliari ad voluntatem dn^i / et qui non. It is
to be enquered of customarye tenauntes / that is to wit / how many there be
and how much land every tenant holds / and what works and customs he
does / and what the works and customs be worth of every tenant by it self
/ and how much rent by the year / above his works and customs he does
pay / and which of them may tax their lands at the will of the lord / and
which not. Customary tenauntes / are those that hold their lands of their
lord by copye of court role / after the custom of the manner. And there may be
many tenau^tes with in the same manner yt have no copyes / and yet hold be
like custom and service at the will of the lord. and in mine opinyon / it
began soon after the conquest / when Wyllyam Conqueror had conquered this
realm / he rewarded all those that ca^e with him in his voyage royal /
according to their degree. And to honorable men he gave / lordshippes / manners
/ lands / and tenementes / withal the inhabytau^tes / men and women dwelling
in the same / to do with the^ at their pleasure. And those honorable men
thought yt they must needs have servants and tenau^tes / and their lands
occupied with tyllage. Wherefore they perdoned the inhabytauntes of their lives
/ and caused them to do all manner of service that was to be done / were it
never so vile / and caused the^ to occupye their lands and tenementes in
tyllage / and took of them such re^tes / customs / and seruyces / as it
pleased the^ to have. And also / took all their goods and catell at all times
at their pleasure / and called them their bond men. and sithe that time / many
noble men both spirytuall and temporal of their godly disposycion / have made
to diverse of the said bond men manumissions / and granted them fredome and
liberty. and set to them their lands and teneme^tes to occupy / after diverse
manners of rentes / customs / and seruyces the which is used in diverse places
unto this day. how be it in some places the bond men continue as yet / the
which me seems is the grettest inconuenye^t that now is suffered by the law.
That is to have any christen man bonden to another / and to have the rule of
his body / lands and goods / that his wife children and servants / have
labored for all their life time / to be so taken / like as and it were
extorcion or bribery. And many times by color thereof / there be many fre men
taken as bond men / and their lands and goods taken fro them / so that they
shall not be able to sue for remedy / to prove them self fre of blood And that
is most commenly / where the fre men have the same name as the bond men have
/ or that his auncesters of whom he is comen / was manumised before his
birth. In such cause there can not be to great a punysshement. for as me
seems / there should no man be bond but to god / and to his king and prince
over him. Quia deus non facit exceptionem personarum. For god makes no
excepcyon of any person Wherefore it were a charytable deed / to every noble man
both spu^all and temporal / to do as they would be done by / and that is to
manumise them that be bond and to make them free of body and blood / reseruyng
to them their rentes / customs / and seruyces / of old time due and
accustomed / wherein they may geat the prayers of the party and remissyon of
their offenses / as in the hospell. Eadem mensura qua mensi fueritis remisictur
vobis. The same measure that ye do mete to other men / shall be metton to you.
In many lordshyppes / there is a customary roole between the lords and their
tenauntes / and it ought to be indented / one part to remain in the lords
keeping / the other part with the tenauntes / and diverse true copyes to be
made of the same / that the rentes and customs run not out of remembrance.
And also a suyte rooll / to call all those by name that owes any suyte to the
lords court / and than shall there be no counselment of the sutours / but that
ye steward may know who is not there. and if any suctour decesse / the name
of his next heir would be entered in to the same roole / and an inquery made
and presented what he held of the lord / and by what tents / customs / and
service of every parcel by itself / and who is his next heir and of what
age he is of. and this truly done and entered in to the role / it would be a
conueyaunce of descent in manner of a pee degree / and profitable to the lords /
and also to the tenauntes / causa patet. The name of every tenant must be put
in the roole / and his mese place to be butted and bonded / as it lies in
length and bread / and between whom. And also / his lands / meadows / leys and
pastures / likewise butted and bonded / that it may be known many years after
who dwelled there: and what lands / meadows / and pastures / lay to the same
at that time. And what warkes and customs the tenaunte does for every parcel
/ and what the works and customs be worth in a year / and how much rent ye
tenant does pay for every parcel beside the customs and works / to the
intent that if any parcel of land / medowe or pastur be aliend / sold / or
changed / or put from one tenant to another. The lord and his baylye may
know what rentes / customs / and works / he shall ask and have of the
occupyer for every parcel. And it is the most special point that longs to
a surueyour / to but and bound truly every parcel by it self / and to know
what rentes / works / customs / and seruyces / gothe out of the same / for
than may he make a true rentall or customarye roole / and put all things in
a certentie.

Of cotyers what cotages and curtilages they hold and by what service / and
how much rent they pay by the year. etc. Cap. xiiii.
ITem inquirendu^ est de cotorellis / que cotagia and curtilagia teneant / et
per quod seruic / et quantu^ reddant per annum / pro predict cotagiis et
curtilagiis. Also it is to be enquered of Cotagers / what cotages and
curtylages they hold / and by what service: and what they yield by the year
for the foresaid cotages and curtylages. This chapter and the next present be
both of one effect / but that it is to p^sume / that there is not so much
rentes / herryottes / customs / and seruyces to be paid and done for a cotage
as there is for a mese place or a better tenement / but it may be like custom
and service.

Of perquesytes or profytes of counties / of courts / and of forestes / what
they be worth by the year. etc. Cap. xv.
ITem inquirend est de perquesitis com mitatuu^ cur forestariorum cum
expeditamentis canum and quantum valent per annum in oi^bus exitibus. Also it
is to be enquered / of the perquesytes and profytes of the cou^ties / of the
courts and of the forestes with the cuttynge of of the dogs cleyse / and
how much they be worth by the year in all the issues and profytes. This
chapter touches not the office of a surueyour but little / for ye yssues and
profytes of the cou^ties / sessyons / and assizes / are most commonly the
kings / and they be kept and ordained by the shiryf and the justices of peace
/ that be ordained and put in co^myssion by the king and his counsel / and
the issues and profytes of them are estreyted by the said justices / and
returned in to the kings escheker / and there they rest of record / the which
afterward is estreyted again / and send down to the shiryffes of every
county to leuy and gader up the same / and thereof to make an acco^pte in the
said escheker / and it is called grene wax. And the courts of the forestes be
ordained and kept by the justices of the forestes and their deputies / and the
issues and profits thereof / the which comes most commonly by fynes and
mercymentes are not estreyted in to the escheker / but made out by the steward
to the baylyes and other officers of them that owes the forest. And there me
seems / the Surueyour may sytte with the justices of the forrestes to one
thing specially / and that is this. that no townshyppe nor hamell enter comen
within the forestes / chases / wastes / heythes / moors / and such other
great co^mens / but all only such that of right ought to have commen within
the same. Wherefore it would be ordained / that every towneshyppe and hamell
that ought to have any such commen in any forestes / chases / wastes / moors
/ heythes / and such other great co^mens: where diverse townshyppes and hamels
enter common toguyder. Every townshyppe and hamell ought to have a diverse
brennynge iron and every be / horse / mare / and colte that is put upon the
common / ought to be brenned in some part of his body with the said iron /
and than shall every be be known of what townshippe he is / And that were a
great redynesse to the kepers / and also a great sauegarde for stealyng of the
catell. And than may the kepars / regarders / goysters / and other officers of
such forest and chases / have parfyte knowledge what townshyppe the catell is
of. And if any of these said officers find any manner of catell having no
such brenne / they may attache them and cease them as streyes / and put
them in sauegarde to the lords use / till they be yered and deyd. And they
ought to ask them three sondayes in three or four next parysshe churches / and
also cry them three times in three the next market towns. And if no man come
within the year and the day / and to make suffycient prove that the catell is
his / than it is forfayte to the lord as a strey. and in like manner the swyne
and sheep of every township and hamell / ought to be pytched with the said
brennyng iron / or such another like the same. but as for all other points
and artycles touching the forestes the Surueyour has little to do. Wherefore I
remyt all other artycles to the justices of the forestes and to their deputies
to execute their office. and ye shall know that no man shall have a forest of
right but the king / except he or his auncest^rs have had a special grant
thereof by charter / of the king and his progenytours in times past / and so
used. etc.

Of churches that belong to the gift of the lord / how many there be / and
where they be / and what every church is worth. etc. Cap. xvi.
ITem inquirend est de ecclesiis / que pertinent ad donationem dn^i / quot sunt
/ et vbi / and quantu^ valent / et qua^tum quelibet ecclia valet per se per
annum / scdm vera^ estimationem illius It is to be enquered of all ye churches
that belong to the lords gift / how many there be and where they be / and what
they be worth / and what every church is worth by it self by the year /
after the true estimacyon of the same. The letter of this chapter is very
plain and needs not much declaracion further than is spoken of / but alonely
in one thing / and that is thus. often times he yt has right to present to a
church at one time / has not right to present to ye said church at the next
time. And that is where any sole patron of a church has issue / two / three /
or four daughters and decesse / so that the right of patronage of the said
church disce^deth to all the said daughters. When ye church is void they
shall present by turn / the eldest daughter first: than the second at the
next auoydaunce / than the.iii. and so forth / till they have presented ones
over. and than to begin again at the eldest daughter / except they make any
other perticyon among them self by agreement. And than must every one of them
present by their turn / according to their petycion / as it comes about. And
so must the Surueyour make his book according to the right of the presentacyon
/ as every time / second time / third time / or fourth time and so forth.
Also what lords or Gentylmen have their tourneyse with them in the same
benifyce / and which of the^ presented last / and who shall have next / and
who than / till they have gone about. and in what town it is / and in what
shyre and dyocise it is / and what every benifyce is worth by it self by the
year / as it can be estymate.

What the herryottes be worth / the feyres / exchetes / customs / seruyces /
and forreyne warkes: the plees and perquesites of the courts / fynes / relefes
/ and all other things that may fall to the lord by the year. etc. Cap. xvii.
INquirendum est quantum valent herriotta / nu^dine / escaeta / consuetudines /
et seruic et operationes forinsie / et quantum valent placita / et perquesita
fines / et reliuia / et omnia alia que accidere possunt per annum in omnibus.
It is to be enquered / what be the value of herryottes / feyres / exchetes /
customs / seruyces / and forreyne warkes: and what the plees be worth / and
the perquesytes or profits of the courts / fynes / relefes / and all other
things may fall by the year in all. This chapter gothe in a generalytie and
is like / as when an audytour has cast all the mynistr and partyculer
accomptes of every baylye or reave and other accomptance / and has made his
book parfyte of all the partyculer / whereupon the whole charge rests. Than
when the lord would know what thertent is of all his hole lands / and also
of every pertyculer parcel by it self / it were to long a process to show
him all the said minystr and partyculer accomptes / and though he did / he
should not know the gross sommes of his rentes / fynes / herryottes / exchetes
/ perquesytes and such other / every of them by him self. Wherefore he will
cause his audytoure to make a value in manner of a bridgement of all the said
minystre acco^ptes / and first to know the hole charge of all the partyculers
/ what they be at the first sight / in the so^mes total. Than to deuyde the
so^mes total in diverse percels / as the chief rentes of the freholders by
themself / the rentes of customary tenau^tes by themself / tenauntes by
inde^ture / or tenau^tes at the lords will by the^ self so that he may make a
gross so^me of every manner of rent* so that one re^t may be known from
another. But than must the audytour have good and parfyte informacion / or else
he can not do it. and that informacion must come by the surueyour and the
baylyes for they ought to know one manner of rent from another / and therefore
their rentalles would be made a cordyng / also the perquesytes of the courts
by themself. And those must be in like manner divided / as ye plees by them
self / the mercementes for common trespace by them self / fynes by them self
/ herryottes by themself exchetes by them self / and so of relefes / feyres /
markettes / and all other casualties / every of the^ by them self and ought to
be presented in the court by them self. And thereof to be made an estreyt to
the bailey or reave to gader by / and brought in to the account to the audytour
/ the which he may deuyde in making of his value / if the acco^ptance bring
him perfyte re^tals and court roles and not else. but if they do it not at the
first time / he must teache and inform the^ how they should make them perfyte.
Also customs / seruyces / and warkes be often time done by bodily service and
warkes / and than they be not to be acompted for / but yet mencyon would be
made in the account thereof. And many times such manner of customs / seruyces
and warkes be turned in to money: And than it commonly gothe with the rentes /
and the bailey or reave is charged therewith. And this chapter reherseth further
/ Et omnia alia que accider possit per annum in omnibus. And of all other
things that may fall to the lord / what they be worth by the year. and
those may be taken as mines of tynne / leed / ore / cole / iron stonne /
freston / mylne stones / gryndell stones / lymestonne / chalk / furlers /
earth / Sand / cley / gravel / brom / gorse or fyrs / marle / turues /
thorns / wood / busshes / heyth / Fern or braken / and such other / if
there be any new found: and ought to be put in a rentall to a certentie /
or else to be put in account by way of approwment. And than thauditour may
deuyde the casualties from the certenties / and to make a gross sum of them
all. And yet may the value of every thing appear and be known / how much it
is by it self. And than must there be deduct out of the said gross sum all
manner of out rentes and ordynary charges: as baylyes fees / reparacyon and
such other / and than^e to make a clear gross sum of every year by him self
/ And because often times more casualties fall or come to the lord more in one
year than in another. Therefore it is conuenyent that the clear gross sommes of
five or six years or mo / would be cast togider in one gross sum / and to
deuyde that sum in as many parts as there was years cast together / and than
the clear value of one year will be commonly about that sum so divided. And
thus ends the brefe declaracyon of this statute Extenta manerii.

Explicit.
Of diverse manners of taking and doing of homage and fealty. Cap. xviii.
IN so much I have showed diverse dyuersites of tenures / and also diverse
manners of making of copyes / and the oaths of the officers of the court /
though they be not expressed in the statute. Me seems also it were conuenyent
to show the dyuersytes and manner of taking and doing of homage and fealty.
And ye shall understand / that homage is the most honorable service and the
most humble service of reverence / that a free man may do to his lord. For
when the tenant shall do homage to his chief lord / of who^e he holds his
chief manner or ma^cyon place / by knight service and priorite. He shall be
vngirde and his heed uncovered / and the lord shall sit and the tenant shall
knele before him on both his knees / and shall hold his hands stretched out
together between the lords hands / and shall say thus. I become your man from
this day forward of life and of membre / and of worldely honor. And to you
shall be faithful and lowly and shall bear faith to you / for the lands and
teneme^tes the which I hold of you / saving the faith that I owe to our
soueraygne lord the king and my other lords. And the lord so sytting shall
kiss his tenant / the which is a sign of perfyte love. And why says the
tenaun of life and of membre / and of all worldely honor? Because he holds
his lands of his lord by knight service and also by priorite. for and he
hold other lands of a another lord by knight service and posteriorite / he
shall not say to him of life and of membre / for though he be bound to him by
reason of his tenures of knight service / to go to battle with his lord / and
to put his life and members in ieopardy with his lord: yet can he not go
with them both. And therefore shall he go to battle with that lord that he
holds his lands of by priorite. And because thereof / if any such tenant dye
/ his heir being within age / the lord shall have the keeping of his body /
and the profit of those lands that be holden of him / during the nonage / and
also the marriage of him. Wherefore it is to be presupposed / that the lord will
be more loving and kind to him / than any other of his friends would be. Seeing
/ that when he comes of full age / he shall put his life in ieopardy for his
lord / the which byndeth the lord by reason the rather to do for him / when
he is not able to help him self. Where as his friends may fortune cared not
for him / and had lever / another had the land than he.

And if an abbot or a priour / or any other man or woman of relygion should do
homage / they shall say I become your man. etc. because they be all only
professed to god to be his men and women / and to none other. And therefore they
shall knele and hold their hands as the other did / and say thus. I do to
you homage and to you shall be faithful and lowly / for the lands and
teneme^tes the which I hold of you / saving the faith that I owe to our
sovereign lord the king. etc.

And if a woman sole should do homage / she shall not say / I become your
woman: for it is not conuenyent that a woman should become woman / to any other
man than to her husband / when she is married. And therefore she shall say as
the relygious men and women does. I do to you homage. etc.

And if a woman covert with baron shall do homage / they shall knele before the
lord both / and the lord shall take both their hands between his hands /
and the husband shall speak all the words / as thus. We to you do homage /
and faith to you we shall bear for the lands that we hold of you / saving
the faith that we owe to our sovereign lord the king his heirs / and to our
other lords: and they both shall kiss the lord. etc.

And in case a man should do homage to his lord / and the lord grant his
homage and service to a another man. Now shall the tenant do his homage and
service to the grauntee / after this manner. I become your man fro this day
forth / and to you shall be faithful and lowly / for the lands and tenementes
that I held of A. B. your grauntour / in the towns of C. D. the which to you
he has granted my homage and service in the said towns / saving the faith
that I owe to our sovereign lord the king and my other lords. etc.

And know you / that one lord may have done to him diverse homages of diverse
tenauntes / for one manner of land. But one tenant shall do but ones homage
for one manner of land / for though the lord dye / his heir or his assign /
if he sell it or grant it a way / they do represent the lords estate. But and
the tenant have done his homage to his lord / and after the manner / whereof
the tenant holds his lands is recovered against the lord. Now shall the
tenant do his homage again to him that recovered the manner / for he comes
not in by the lord / but by force of the recouere / the which proves the
first homage to be void / for it was done to him that had no right to take it.
etc.

Also ye shall know / that a man may distreyne his tenauntes catell for
homage by course of the commen law / and also for relefe. And though a man
have paid his relefe / yet he shall do homage and feaultie. also ye shall
understand / that no man shall do homage / but he that has a state of
enherytaunce in fee simple or in fee tail / in his own right or in his wives
/ for tenauntes for term of life / tenauntes by the courtesye / nor tenant in
dower / shall do no homage nor take no homage. etc.

And if a man hold lands of the king in chief / and have issue three or four
daughters and dye / all ye daughters shall do homage to the king. and if the
lands be holden of another lord / the eldest daughter shall do homage for all
/ and also ye seruyces. and the other daughters shall be contrybutories / and
bear every one of them their porcyon of the same.

And when a fre man shall do feaultie to his lord / he shall ley his hand
upon the book / and shall say thus. Here you my lord that I W.O.D.E. fro
this day forth / to you shall be faithful and lowly / and faith to you shall
bear for the lands and teneme^tes / that I claim to hold of you / and
loyally shall do and pay the rentes / customs / and seruyces / that I ought
to do at the terms assygned / as god me help and all saints / and than kiss
the book.

When a villayne shall do feaultie to his lord / he shall ley his hand upon
the book and say thus. Here you my lord R. that IW. de C. fro thus day forth
to you shall be faithful and lowly / and to you shall do all the customs and
seruyces that I ought to do to you / for the lands that I hold of you in
vyllenage / and I shall be iustifyable of body and of goods / as god me help
and his saints / and than kiss. etc.

When a villayne that holds no lands of ye lord shall do feaultie / he
shall ley his hand upon the book and say thus. Here you my lord S. that
IW.B. fro this day forth to you shall be faithful and lowly and I shall be
iustifyable to you of body and of goods as god me help and his saints / and
kiss the book. etc.

What a surueyour should do. Cap. xix.
Now this statute is breuely declared / it would be understand / how a
lordshyp or a manner shu de be surueyed and vewed butted and bounded on every
perte / that it may be known for ever / whose every parcel thereof was / at
the making of this book. and it may serve as well to save the inherytau^ce of
the lords / as of every fre holder by charter / copye holder / and customary
holder / and to know every man's land as it lies to his house one from
another. so that it may be known an hundred years after and for ever / what
manner of lands / and how many acres every man had to his house at that time /
and where they lies. The name of a surueyour is a french name / and is as
much to say in English as an ouerseer. Than it would be known / how a
surueyour should ouerse (...) ^uruey a town or a lordshyppe / as and the city
of London should be surueyed. The surueyour may not stand at Hygate / nor at
Shotershyll / nor yet at the Blackheth nor such other places / and over look
the city on every side. For and he do / he shall not se the goodly streets /
the fair buyldinges / nor ye great substance of richesse contained in them /
for than he may be called a disceyuer and not a surueyer. and in like wise if
a man shall vieu a close or a pasture / he may not look over the hedge and go
his way / but he must outher ride or go over / and se every parcel thereof. and
to know how many acres it co^teyneth / and how much thereof was medowe
ground / how much pasture ground / how much wode ground or busshe
ground / heythe / lyng / or such other. and what an acre of medowe ground is
worth / and what an acre of pasture and what an acre of the wood ground or
busshe / and such other be worth. And what manner of catell it is best for /
and how many catell it will grass or find by the year / and what a beasts
grass is worth by the year in such a pasture / or else he can not set a true
value what it is worth. And therefore a Surueyour must be dilyge^t and laborous
and not slothful and rechelesse / for and he be / he is not worthy to have
his fee or wages / and may fortune to make an imperfect book / And if he so do
/ it is to his shame and rebuke / and great ieopardy to his soul to make a
false presydent Wherefore it is conuenyent to remember the saying of the wise
philosofer. Abhibe curam. that is to say take heed to thy charge. and so if he
should vieu a city or a town / he must begin at a certain place / as and it
were at the draw bridge of London bridge on the Eest side / and there to make
his tytelynge where he begi^neth and to show who is lord of the house next
unto the said bridge / and who is tenant. And if he be a free holder / what
chief rent it pays to the lord customs or other seruyces. and if it be no
free hold / than the rent needs not to be spoken of but at his pleasure / for
it may rise and fall / and how many foot in bread and how many en length.
Than to the second house on the same Eest side in like manner / and so to
peruse from house to house / till he come to saint Magnus church. And than
return again to the said draw bridge on the West side / and there begin at
the house next to the said bridge / and so to peruse fro house to house / till
he come to the corner next Te^mes street. and than he may chose wheder he will
follow the southe side of the said Te^mes street Westwarde and Eestwarde / till
he have perused the hole parissh And if there be any manner of gardens / entres
/ or aleys / or other dwelling places withi^forthe / they may not be
ouerskipped / forgoten / nor laft out / but taken by the way: How much every
garden is / how long every aley and enter is / and how many dwelling places
be therein / and whose they be / and how many cellars or tauernes there be /
and how many footes every one of them be in length and bread. And so to go
from parysshe to parysshe / till he had viewed the city / and every street and
lane would be remembered what length and bread they be of. And also / every
church and church yard and other void places / the which would ask a
great leysar / but yet it is possible to be done.

How a man should vieu / but and bound / the manner and the towneshyppe. Cap.
xx.
The town of Dale.
THe vieu of the manner of Dale taken the tenth day of May / the.xiiii. year of
the raygne of king Henry the.viii. by AB general Surueyour to the right
honorable lord C. D. lord of the same and by his commandment / and also by
the oaths of OF. GH. and many other tena^tes of the same / as herafter ensues.

The city of the manner of Dale / stands and lies between the kings hyway

even Eest or West north or southe / but sometime more of one part than of
another. As southe Est or southe West / north Eest or north West / and some
two parts of the one and but the third part of the other. as north north
Eest / north north West / Eest north Est / and Eest southe Est / southe
southe eest / and southe southe West / and West southe West / and West north
west. But it needs not to a surueyour to take so narowe a dyuersite / but to

butte truly.

How a man should butte and bound the feldes. Cap. xxi.
The north field upon Dale furlong.
THe north field lies on the north side of the town / and begins at the
cross at a furlong called Dale furlong / ye which furlong conteyneth.xxx.
lands and two heed lands / and they but on north and southe. whereof the
southe ends butteth upon the hall orcharde and upon the crofte of IC. and the
north ends but upon ryhyll. Than to begin on the Est side next to the hiwaye
that leads to A. the person has two lands / the lord three lands. I. B.
one land. F. G. two lands / the lord four lands / the priour two lands /
the person one land. R. X* two lands. W. C. one land. H. L. one land. T. S.
two lands / the priour three lands / the lord two lands. G. H. one land the
person one land / the lord two lands next to the West side / and the heed
land next to the hall orcharde and the other heed land is the persons next
ryehyll. and if the husbands have perfyte knowledge which is a rod and
which is an half acre. than it were better to say the lord has an acre /
containing three lands are made in four or five lands / and I. C. half acre
made in two lands / and T S a rod in one land and if it be less than a
rod / than call it a but. howebeit a man may perceive and know if any man
make two lands of one land / or of one land make two lands / because of the
certain nombre of every flat.

Ban furlong lies next to the same / and co^teyneth xxiii. lands / and one
hadla^de at the ouerendes / and they lie Eest and West / and but upon Dale
furlong / at the neder ends / and on the southe side next the persons crofte.
The person has three lands / the priour one land. I. C. two lands the lord
four lands. I B. two lands. T. S. two lands. H. L. one land G. H. one
land. F. G. one land. R. X. three lands / ye prioure two lands. P. Q. one
land / the lord has the hadlandes.

Whethyll furlong / lies next to the same hadla^des and it co^teyneth.xxxvi.
lands / and three gores fother or pyke / and they be all one thing. and be
called so / because they be broad in the one end and a sharke pyke in the
other end / and they be always shorter than the other lands / and they but
upon the said hadlande of ye land at the west end / and upon depesyche at the
Eest end. and to begin at the north west side of the said flate HL two

person three lands. WC two lands and one pyke / the priour two lands and one
pyke / FG two lands and one pyke / the lord four lands / RX three lands / TS
two lands / GH two lands and the lord three lands next to the southest side.

Than turn again to rye hill / that conteyneth xxxvi. lands and two pikes /
and but upon Dale fur long on the southe ends / and upon long medowe upon the
north west ends. Than on the southe Eest side next to the way that leads to
A. the priour has two lands G.H. one land / the person two lands I.B. two
lands. F.G. two lands / ye lord three lands two pikes. W.C. two lands / RX
three lands / TS two lands / PQ two lands / HL two lands / the lord three
lands next to the balke that the wyndmylne stands upon. etc.

PQ the which holds a cotage of the lord / holds also this said wyndmylne
/ whereunto all the lords tenauntes are bound to grynde all their corn and
malte that they occupy of their own / at the said mylne / as well free
tenauntes as other. and the lord shall find all manner of tymbre and iron
work / board and nails. And bring the^ to the mylne / and the mylner shall
neyle up the bordes / make his shafte and the sail yardes / uphold and
reparell the spindell and the rynde / the mylne pykes and the sail clothes /
cogge and ronge / at his own proper cost and charge. And shall pay by the
y^re.xx.s. at the terms there vsuell / and to grynde the lords corn and
maulte tole free / and to grynde it first / next to the corn that is in the
hopper / if any be. etc.

On the other side of the wind mylne balke lies a flat called Peyse hill /
and it conteyneth.liii. lands and four pykes and one hadlande / of the which
lands there be six of them / that break or cut in the mids of the lands
/ as shall appear by the boundyng. And the said flat lies bitwene the commen
pasture / called the balke on the southe Eest / and the foresaid medowe called
the long medowe upon the north West / and next unto the foresaid balke / I.C.
has three lands / the lord six lands and a pyke / the person four lands
and a pyke / IB four lands / FG two lands and a pyke / WC three lands / RX
two lands / at the upper end next to the hadlande / PQ the nether ends of
the lands next to the long medowe / TS four lands / HL three lands at the
heed and IC the nether ends of the same / the priour.v. lands / the lord
eight lands / IB three lands / GH two lands and a pyke / FG one land at the
heed / HL two lands / buttyng upon the same one land / and upon the medowe /
the person three lands next to the north Eest side / and the prioure has the
hadlande at the heed. And this me seems should be suffycient instructyon for
buttyng and boundyng of all the feldes one after another. etc.

How a man should butte and bound the meadows. Cap. xxii.
The long medowe belongyng to the townshyppe of Dale.
THe long medowe lies upon the north side of the north field / between the
said field and the broke / that departs the townshyp of Dale and the
townshippe of Sale. and the West ends butteth upon the way that leads to A.
and the Eest end of the same medowe upon a close of the said lords / called
ye park close / and conteyneth. C. xxii. acres. this medowe lies in diverse
shotes of length / sometime in two shotes of length / sometime in one / and
sometime in three. Than to begin at the west side next to the way that gothe to
A. on the over shot / the lord has four acres IC two acres and a half / the
person three acres. IB two acres and a half. FG three acres / the prioure four
acres / the lord.viii. acres. And on the nether shot next unto the broke next
to the said hiwaye / FG two acres / the priour four acres / GH half an acre /
WC two acres and a half / RX six acres / the lord vii. acres. Than to the
long dolez yt butte fro the said north field to the said broke. TS four acres
/ the person three acres / IC an acre and a half / IB an acre and a half /
the lord six acres / PQ three acres / HL three acres. And at the nether end of
the said three acres / IK lord of sale has attached his weyre of his mylne of
Sale / for the which attachement the said IK pays to the lord of Dale and
to his heirs every year.ii.s. at the feast of saint Mighell tharcha^gell / for
all manner of service. etc. Than to the over shot next the said field / GH an
acre and a rod / WC three rods / RX an half acre / the lord two acres /
the person half an acre / PQ half an acre / the priour two acres and a half
/ IC two acres / the lord four acres / TS two acres next to the park close.
Than to the myddell shot next to the long dolez / FG an acre / the person
three acres / IB two acres / the lord four acres / HL two acres / ye priour
four acres next to the said park close. Than to the nethermast shot next the
broke on the side next to the long doles / the person two acres / RX three
acres / the lord four acres and a half / GH di^ acre / the priour two acr /
WC two acres and a di^ / IC di^ acre / TS two acres / IB two acres in the
corner next to ye said park close and butteth upon the said broke. And if
there be any mo meadows / than but them and bound them in like manner / for the
mo meadows there be and the fewer shottes / the better they may be bou^ded. for
meadows go most commonly by acres / half acres / and rods / and they ought
to be well staked between every man's dole / and specially well stoned with
great stones between / and set on a great heyght that they synke not far in
to the earth / for the property of a stonne is to dyscende downewarde / and
the property of earth to asce^de upward. Therefore they would be taken head
unto be time / and amended when need is. And this me seems suffycient. etc.

How a man should butte and bound his pastures. Cap. xxiii.
The pastures belongyng to the same town.
THe lord has a close called park close / and it co^teyneth.xxx. acres / and
it lies between the said medowe called long medowe on the West part and a
close of the persons called Oxhey on the Est perte / and the said broke on the
north part / and a field called Eest field on the southe part / and it is
worth by the year twenty shillynges. etc.

The person has a close next to the same called ox / hey and it conteyneth.x.
acres / and lies between the park close on the West part / and a close of
I.B. on the Eest side / and the said broke on the north est perte and a field
called Eest field on the West part. I do not value it / because it is not the
lords / the quantite of the acres therein is suffycient. etc.

The said IB holds a little crofte freely / belongyng to the tenement called
rye croft / and co^teyneth two acres / and lies between the said persons close
on the west side / and the lane that gothe toward R. on the southe Est side /
and butteth upon the hiway that comes from S. to the said town of Sale on
the north est side / and the said Est field on the west perte I set it at no
value / because he is a freholder / and ronneth in the chief rentes of his
house / but and it be given to the freholder by another deed / than must ye
surueyour express the chief rent thereof by it self. And it is the most
special point to a surueyour / first to a view / butte / and bound / both
the town and the hole lordeshyppe / or ever he desire to se or look upon any
euydence of any freholders. For this first done / the Surueyour may than
parfitely know wheder the freholder show his euydence for all his land or
not / and let the surueyour have good remembrance / what parcelles of lands
be contained in the said euydence. And than may he well parceyue wheder he
show for all or not. And if the deeds be showed first / the tenant may say
there is for all his land / and the surueyour can not control him nor say
nay. etc.

FG holds a crofte of the lord / lyeng next on the othersyde of the said
lane called Gose crofte / and co^teyneth two acres and a half / and butteth
upon the said hiwaye on the north est side / and the said Eest field on the
west part. etc. And thus ye may paruse / butte and bound all the croftes /
closes / and pastures about the town and within the lordshippe / whose so ever
they be. And to express every hiwaye or cross / common / balke / or marle
pytte / where they lie / the which shall be a great redynesse many years
hereafter. And if there be any commen pastures where heerdmen keep their catell
/ or any commen wodes / mores / heythes / or such other / they may not be
forgoten to be butted and bounded as they lie. etc.

How a man should a mende errable land. Cap. xxiiii.
IT is conuenyent that a husband keep his errable land lyenge round / that
it be not to high in the rygge / nor to low in the mids of ye sides / nor
to hye a little fro the rain: for than will ye water stand in the sides of
the lands and drown ye corn. and though there be no corn / yet it wereth
the ground and makes it lene / for sta^dyng water distroyeth grass / and
therefore it must needs distroye corn / the which is much more tendrer than
the grass. And if it so be / than take thy ploughe and begin to plowe a forowe
in the mids of the side of the land / and cast it down as and thou should
falowe it / and so peruse both sides till the rigge be cast down. and than
take thy ploughe again and begin to plowe where thou dydest plowe first / and
rygge all the remynaunt upward / and so shall thou both cast thy lands and
rigge it / and all at one plowyng. And this will make the land to lie round /
the which is good both for corn and grass. etc.

Another manner of me^dyng of errable land / is to mucke it / marle it / lyme
it / or dong it / with ye carte or wayne. and as I said in the book of
husbandry / to set thy dong upon the first sturryng when it is rygged / for
that is best for many causes. and if thou lay it upon the falowyng / than set
thy mucke hepe in the reyne of the land and than sprede it / and all that
falls in the rygge cast it out again / for else it does but little good /
for it will be covered with earth and syldome seen again. etc.

Another manner of mendynge of errable land / is to set thy sheep fold upon
it / and to flytte it every day / and it is better upon the sturrynge than
upon the falowe / and the sheep fold is better upon the rye ground than upon
the whete ground. etc.

Another manner / when a husband has much errable land / and has no donge
nor sheep to compost nor donge his land with all. Than let the husband take
his plough / and cast all such lands three or four times together / and make
the rigge there as ye reyne was before. And if the lands be to broad when it
is so cast down / than rygge either side by it self / and so make two lands
of one land / or three lands of.ii lands. And so shall he find new moolde
that was not seen in a hundred years before / the which must needs give more
corn than the other did before. etc.

How a man should amend his meadows. Cap. xxv.
SE that there be no moldy warpes castige in the meadows / and if there be / in
April let them be spradd and beaten small. And this is ye best way to sprede
them and make them small. To take a great boughe of a tree / and to plass he
the bows abroad and lay them low / and if they lie not broad enough / than
take other small bows and bind them fast to the same / and to ley a tree or
two ouerthwarte the bows / to hold them down flat to the earth / and to
bind the trees or the bows that it fall not of. And than to boore an hole
with an nauger in the great boughs end / or else to tie a rope fast to all the
boughs ends toguyder / and to fast the teym to the same / and with oxen or
horses to draw the said boughs / both up and down and ouerthwarte the
said moldy warpe hills / the which shall spredde them better / than any
man's hands can do. and that shall refresshe the grass and make the meadows
much better.

Another manner of mendynge of meadows / is if t^ere be any rynning water or
land flode / that may be set or brought to run over the meadows / from the
time that they be mowen unto the beginning of May / and they will be much the
better. and it shall kylle / drown / and drive away the moldywarpes / and
fill up the low places with sand and make the ground even and good to mow.
All manner of waters be good / so that they stand not still upon the ground.
But specially that water that comes out of a town from every man's mydding
or donghyll is best / and will make the meadows most rankest. And fro the
beginning of May till ye meadows be mowen and the hay gotten in / the waters
would be set by and ron another way / for diverse consideracyons. etc.

To amend and make better / diverse manners of pastures.
IT is undoubted / but there be diverse manners of pastures / as low ground like
medowe ground / ley ground / the which has been errable ground of late /
busshie ground the which sometime has been errable ground / busshye ground
the which was never errable ground / gorstye ground / the which has been
errable ground / gorstie ground / the which was never errable. Brom ground
/ heyth ground / marrys ground / chalk ground flyntie ground / chylturne
ground / and lymestonne ground.

To amend low ground like medowe ground.
ye shall do by it as I have showed you in the next chapter before of your
meadows / and if any water stand still and will not void / make a dyche / two
or three / as need shall require / and opyn the sides of the dyche that the
water may come in to it. Convey the water away / and with a ploughe make
diverse sorrows from the said dyche up in to the pastur / where the water
stands / and with a Carte / a wayne / or a sleyde / carry away therthe that
the ploughe tourneth up / or else it will stop the water on the one side. and
if the ploughe forowe be to little / thanne make diverse small dychesse and open
them on both sides / so that thou leave no water standing in the pastur no
time of the year. And melche kye / draught oxen / laboring horses and mares /
be most conuenyent to go together in such pastures. etc.

How to amend ley ground / the which has been errable land of late. Cap.
xxvii.
YE must take heed how the leyse lie / and specially that they lie not to
high / for and they do / it is more profit to ye husband to cast it down
again / and sow it with otes / one year / two / or three / and to ley it lower
and round in good temper. and se that no water stand at the lands ends /
buttyng on the heed lands. and if it so do / than with a ploughe cast a forowe
toward the heed lands / and than the water will follow that forowe and make
the lands dry. But that forowe will not serve paste one or two years / but it
must be renewed / And if it wax mossye in winter / than would it be plowed
again and sown with diverse corns / as the ground requires. And at the
first plowynge it would be plowed a square forowe / as deep as it is broad /
and laid flat and sown with otes / that the moss may rote / and than to
lie falowe one year / and than to be sown with wheat / rye / or barlye / as
the husband thinks most co^uenyent. And if it should lie falowe the first
year the moss will not rote / and at winter it will be weate / and drown all
the wheat and rye that it touches. And if a man have plenty of such pasture
that will be mossye every third year / let him break up a new pese of ground
and plowe it and sow it (as I have said before) and he shall have plenty of
corn with little dongynge. and sow it no lengar than it will bear plenty of
corn without dong / and it will bear much better grass ten or.xii. year
after. And if the leyse be to broad / than make two lands of one land (as I
have said before) And sheep are the most conuenyent catell that may go on
such pasture / and best they will amend the grass. and to take good head
that ye suffer nouther breres nor black thorns / nor none other manner of
busshes to grow in your pastures / and specially by the hedges. etc.

How to amend busshy ground and mossy / that has been errable land of old
time. Cap. xxviii.
THere is none other remedy / but to stock and get up the busshes by the
rotes / and the lands plowed and sown (as I have said before) the reyst
ground if it be dry will bring much corn / for the moss will rote / and
the moole hyllockes will amend the ground well. And if there be any marle
pyttes / that have be made of old time within the same cloyse / than^e when
the lands begin to wear / if he have not sufficient of such busshye and
mossye ground to break up and sow. than there would be new marle pyttes made
and the lands new marled / the which is much better than outher / donge /
mucke / or lyme / for it will last twenty years together / if it be well done
/ and shall be the better while it is land. And I marueyle greatly that in the
common feldes / where of old time has been made many great marlepytes / the
which has done much good to the lands / that now a days no man does
occupy then make none other. and they need not to doubt / but there is marle
now as well as was than but as me seems there be two causes why* one is / the
tenauntes be so doutefull of their land lords / that if they should marle and
make their holdynges much better / they fear leest they should be put out
or make a great fine / or else to pay more rent. And if a lord so do / me
seems he is unreasonable / seeing that it was done all at the costs of his
tenaunte / and not at his. The second cause is / that men be disposed to
ydelnesse and will not labor as they have done in times paste / but pass
forth the time as his father did before him. but yet me seems a freholder
should not be of that co^dycion / for he is in a surety / his chief lord can
not put him out doing his duty. And he knows well / he shall take ye
profit while he lives and his heirs after him / and thus should give him a
courage to improwe his own / the which is as good as and he had purchased as
much as the improwment comes to. And one man this doing / would give other
men a courage and a good example to follow the same. And all other countries may
take ensample at Chestershyre and Lancastershyre / for many of them that have
so done / have made the improwmente as good as the land was before. etc.

How a man should amend b^^^hye ground that was never errable land. Cap.
xxix.
YE must consider what the ground is disposed unto / and wheder it be dry or
wete / or be disposed to bear wood / grass or corn. If it be dry and full
of gravel it is better to bear wode / than outher corn or grass. If it be
weate ground / it is not good for corn: but it will bear both wode and
grass. But and it be a black earth and dry / it is good for corn / and it
will quyte the cost to stock it up by the rotes / and to sow it with corn.
And if it be white cley / it is most commenly a weate ground / and than it is
not good for corn / but it will bear both wode and grass: and an acre of
wode is as good as an acre of corn ground / or of grass / and in some places
much better. And if ye will increase the said busshy ground and to make more
wode: than between Myghelmas and Martylmas / ye must gader many akehornes and
put them in erthen pottes / for those will keep them moist / and in February
and March set the said akehornes in the said busshes / as thycke as ye will
/ and undoubted they will grow. And also ye may get the keys of ashes /
nuttes / and such other / and set them in like manner / and to keep all manner
of catell that will eat any wode out of the same ground till it be past
danger of catell. etc.

How to amend wode ground that lies in several pasture. Cap. xxx.
IF they be great old trees / if ye fell the^ by the earth / there will never
come any spring of them up again / except they have many small pumples and
springes about the rotes. And therefore such old trees would be but lopped and
cropped / to bear more wode still / and if it be a good ground to bear corn
and be but a few trees / than it were best to stock the^ up by the rotes /
and to plowe it and sow it. And if it be but young wode / ye may chose wheder
ye will shrede it / loppe it / or croppe it / or fell it by the earth. And if
ye fell it by the earth and keep the spring well ye shall have for every tree
two or three trees / so that it be field at a due season of the year / and that
is between Candelmas and May / whereof I have spoken sufficiently enough in
the book of husbandry.

How to amend gorsty ground that has been errable land. Cap. xxxi.
yE shall understand that there be two manner of gorse / and some men call
them fyrse. One manner will grow on dry ground / and that manner will grow as
high as a man / and have a great stalk as much as a walkyng staff. and if
ye will suffer them to grow and fell them not / by process of time when
beestes go among them / and specially in winter time for cold / and in somer
for shade that will cause them to dye. And many times and long contynuall
frost in winter will kill these manner of gorse: and when they be deed / if ye
plowe the land again and sow it with corn when it lies ley again / the
gorse will grow again. And the best remedy for growing again / is to put
upon such manner of pasture many sheep to eat it bare / but in many places
they set great store by those manner of gorse / and specially for their
fuel: and would not give an acre of gorsty land for two acres of errable
land. And on that manner of gorsty land would grow good corn with little
donge / and it is more profit to plowe it and sow it / than to lie ley /
except he keep it for his fuel* and they grow most commenly upon dry
ground / somewhat sandye or gravel / and Sheep is the most conuenyent catell
that may go upon such pasture.

How to amend gorstye land that was never errable land. Cap. xxxii.
IF the ground be dry and grow full of such manner of gorse with the great
stalks / ye be at your liberty to do as I have said / and if it be of the
other manner of gorse or fyrse / the which grow low by the earth and have but
little small stalks. that manner of gorse grows always on welspring ground
somewhat moist and weate / and it will never bear good corn / but hew it up
to bake and brewe withal / for it will not lightlye be distroyed / for if it
be bre^de it will grow again. But and there be marle underneath in the ground
within the same close / if ye make cost / than bren the gorse at March / and
with a bygge and many oxen / plowe it and make small lands / and than marle
them and sow them with otes / for that corn will grow best on such ground.
And if this will not serve it is past remedy / for marle me^deth all manner of
ground but it is costely. etc.

How to amend bromy ground Cap. xxxiii.
Brom grows always upon dry and sandy ground / and it will bear good rye
and otes but it will not endure to bear corn long / without it be donged
with the carte or with the sheep fold / or both. And if ye let it lie ley and
plowe it not / ye brom will come again. and sheep is the best catell to hold
it under / but nevertheless it will grow. When it is grown of a yard of
heyght or more / than it is good to bake and brewe with / and specially when a
house is thacked / to take the brom and make it i^ quarters of a yard long /
or there about / and to prick them in to the thacke by and by / and cover the
thacke clean over / and it shall both keep out weate and also save it from
pulling down with crows / pyes / dawes / or choughes: And if ye would
distroy it when it is grown three or four foot of height / than about saint
James day fell it a foot above therthe or more / and than the stalk will dye
for a good season / but if it be plowed again / it will grow as fast as ever
it did / when he leaves plowyng.

How to amend heythy ground. Cap. xxxiiii.
ye shall understand that there be four manners of heyth ground.s. heyth
growyng upon gravel / and heyth growyng upon sand. these two manner of heth
grounds will bear no corn without much donge or mucke / for seldom is
there any marle under that manner of heyth / And in many countries where plenty
of lyme stonne is / the husbands do bren the lyme stonne with wode and secole
/ and make lyme thereof: and do set it upon their lands as they do their dong
and do sprede it in like manner / the which they call much better than dong /
for lyme is hot of him self The other two manners of heyth / is heyth growyng
upon white cley ground / and heyth growyng upon black earth / that lies low
like marrys ground / and underneath these two manner of heyth grounds / there
lies most commonly marle. Than brenne the heyth and search for the marle /
and dygge it up and ley it thycke upon the ground and sprede it / and than
plowe it and sow it. and it is much better tha^ outher lyme mucke / or any
manner of dong / and lengar it will last and se that there be no water standing
upon the said ground. etc.

How to amend marres ground. Cap. xxxv.
THere is none other remedy / but first to dreyne the water clean away. And
this is a good meyne to dreyne ye water clean away. First in the lowest close
where the water may be best avoided: Make a great dyche and a deep / that the
water may avoid. And if all the water will not come to that great diche but
stand still in diverse places / thau^e make many small dyches one in to
another / from the said standing waters / so that all these standing waters may
come in to the great dyche / and that by reason should dreyne the water clean.
And in a dry somer ye may make many broad and deep diches and sever ye marres
in diverse pastures / and make bridges over the dyches in to every close / and
diverse lanes made like a causey to convey the catell in to the pastures / so
that one causey or lane / may serve the closes or pastures on both sides. And
in the lowest place of every close or pasture / make a trenche or a little
dyche in to the great dyche that gothe about. And this shall ye make by
process good pastures of marres ground / and ever the lengar the better
pastures: and specially if ye put in much catell / it shall make the better
grass and the fyner. And melche kye / draught oxen / and labourynge horses /
is the best catell to make good pasture on marres ground / and sheep on dry
ground / for they will eat the ground most barest / and that causes the
grass to be good and fine. And if this manner of dichynge will not make the
marres ground dry / than must you make a sough underneath therthe as men do to
get cole / iron / stonne / leed / ore / or tyn And if that will not serve /
than keep out your catell for fear of drownyng. etc.

How to amend bromy ground and ferny ground. Cap. xxxvi.
BRomye ground and fernye ground be much of one nature / for they grow on
sa^dye and dry ground: And they will bear good rye / barley / bygge / or
beyre / and otes / if they be donged with sheep / carte or wayne: For such
light ground will soon wear and wasshe with water / if it be not donged. And
if they lie vnplowed / they will grow full of bro^e and fern / and if ye will
distroy the brom when it is grown three or four foot hye / In Mydsomer mo^ne
or soon after when it is full blomed / with a hedgynge byll cut the stalks
half a yard above the earth / so that ye leave no grene stalk growyng upon
the rote and that will cause it to dye. But and ye plowe it again and after
let it lie / it will grow again. and if ye mow fern when it is young / so
that it be mowen before Mydsomer / by use of such mowynge it will wear away.

Of chylturne ground / flyntie ground / and chalk ground. Cap. xxxvii.
CHylturne ground and flyntie ground be light grounds and dry / and full of
small stones / and chalk ground is much of the same nature / and they will
wear and wasshe away with water. And therefore they would be donged / as the
bromye and fernye grounds be / for marle is seldom found in these manner of
grounds. And therefore / if ye want sheep and dong / they would lie ley and
rest the^ that they may mende with lyeng.

Of lyme stonne ground. Cap. xxxviii.
LIme stonne ground is very good / both for corn and grass / and yet in
some places there will much heyth grow upon lyme stone ground / and that is
long of ill husbandry. For and that heyth were bre^ned / plowed / and sowed
ye first year with otes / and than falowed and sowed with whete / rye / and
barley / and after with beans or pees / it will bear much corn with little
donge / and shall bear always after the better grass. And sheep is the best
catell that can go upon any of these six manner of grou^des / and best they
will amend the grass / and keep them self from rotyng. And he that has
lymestone / may bren it with cool and wode and make lyme / wherewith he may
lyme his ground and that will bring good corn / or he may sell his lyme at
his pleasure.

What profytes may come or grow to the lord by reason of his waters. Cap.
xxxix.
FIrst ye shall understand / that there be diverse manners of waters: that is to
say sta^dyng waters / as poles / meyres / mottes / and stews. And also ronnyng
waters / as great ryuers / small ryuers / brokes / sucches / welspringes / and
pyttes: than what profit may come to the lord of them. The lord may set
the fysshinges of all these said waters to his tenau^tes for certain rent /
and he may reserve to him self certain fysshe / or to fysshe certain times
/ or at any time at his pleasure.

The manner to make diverse manner of mylnes. Cap. xl.
ALso upon these waters / the lord may set diverse manner of mylnes / the
which may be to the lords great ease and profit. As upon the great rivers /
corn mylnes that be called ground mylnes / and they be called ground mylnes
/ because the ouersyde of the heed sylle lies even level with the ouersyde of
the ground / in the bottom of the water. And also fullyng mylnes / otherwise
called walk mylnes / may be made in like manner / and stand also upon the great
ryuers. And tha^ one whele is able to drive two stocks / that is to say /
both a potyer and a faller / the faller both to scour and herely / and the
potyere to thick the clothe. And commenly these mylnes be not set upon the
great stremes of these great ryuers / but a great part of the water is
conveyed out of the great streme by a mylne fleme made with man's hand to a
certain place / where wysemen think the mylne most co^uenyent to be set /
and the said water to be holden up and brought to the said mylne / by reason
and setting of a weyre overthwart the said streme / made of trouse / tymbre /
or stonne / or of both. And when it is palte the mylne with a suffycient fall
of the water / that the mylne stand not in back water / to return in to the
river again. and in many places / the said mylnes be set on the one side of
the great river / and a weyre made of tymbre and stone to hold up the water to
the mylne / the which is a great cost / and many times it will stand in lack
of water that it may not well go at a great stood / except the ground warke be
made very hie. But they be profitable both in grin dynge of corn and fullyng
of clothe / and in taking of much fysshe. And in like manner these said two
manner of mylnes may be set upon small ryuers / without any fleme castyng /
but all only his weyre to hold up the water / and his flode gates to let it
go at a flode / when need shall require. Also there be other two manner of corn
mylnes / that is to say: a breast mylne and an ouershotte mylne / and those
two manner of mylnes be set and go most commenly upon small brokes / and upon
great poles and meyres. And they have always abroad bow a foot broad and more
and the ladelles be always shrouded with compast bordes on both sides to hold
in the water / and than they be called bokettes. And they must be set much
nerer toguyder than the ladelles be / and much more a sloope downewarde / to
hold much water that it fall not out / for it drives the whele as well with
the weight of the water as with ye strength. And the mylner must draw his
water acordyng to his bokettes / that they may be always full and no more / for
the longer that they hold the water the better they be. Also another manner of
fullyng mylnes / may be set and go upon the said small brokes / pooles / or
meyres. and those be called fallers / for a faller by himself requires not so
great strength of water as the potyer does / because the water comes most
commonly over the whele / and the braces do butte heue up the two fete that
fall in to the stock upon the clothe / the which causes the clothe to thick
and turn. Also these mylnes that be set and go on small waters / may go and
ron with a gogyn of iron upon bulder stones or upon brass as a bell does /
for yt will go most lightest. But these mylnes that go upon these great ryuers
/ that be broad / heavy / and weighty / must needs have two great thycke hoopes
of iron four inches broad / and an inche thycke: and eight or nine inches
between the sides / set on both ends of the shafte / for the gogyn of iron
will not bear them / and specially the fullynge mylne. And that mylne that
gothe with a gogyn / yet must it have on either end of the shafte a hoope of
iron and bulders under / and if the gogyn feyle or wax lose / but it shall not
touch them both attones. And let the mylner take good head both to the
gogyns and hoopes that they be not lose for than will the shafte ends brenne
of. For than he hurts his lord / his master / or himself / for mylne
shaftes be costely. But in so much as there is great profit to the lords in
making of these mylnes / and the most rent is raised upon so little ground /
and often times for want of the sede of discrecyon and experyence of good
making / there be many defautes made in them / and specially in making of the
mylne troughe / where the mylne whele gothe / for often times they make it to
holowe and deep under ye whele / that the water stands therein when the mylne
gothe not / for the tail syll would lie bare and dry when the myln gothe not.
And the tail sylle would lie twenty inches or.xxiiii. under the heed sylle /
and the troughe would not pass three inches holowe at the most / and as long
as it may receive three ladelles / the fourth ladell entering the water / and
the fyfte ladell leaving the water. And the struck sylles both above and
under would be of a good length / so that the whele come not nighe unto the
draught gate be two foot or more / for the further fro the gate the bygger and
the swyfter is the streme. And the lengar that the ladell is the better it is /
so yt it have sufficyent water. And than the mylner needs not to draw up his
gate so high / as and the ladell be short / for the ebber the water is the
swifter it is. And a double bowed whele is much better than a syngle bowed
whele / for many causes / if there be sufficient water / and better it will
keep the ladels from losing. The ladell most commenly of a double bowed whele
/ would be three foot long and a foot broad / and to draw up his draught gate
nine or ten inches is suffycient: And than shall not the bow of the whele be
hid nor covered in ye water / and than it gothe swyftly. And upon the great
ryuers the ladelles may be an elne long / but for the weight and drawing up
of the draught gate. etc. The greatter compass the whele is / the less water
will drive it: but it will not go so often about as a little whele will do. But
the cogge whele in a corn mylne / is a great helper if it be well pycked /
well cogged / and well ro^ged / six ronges and.xlviii. cogges / are best for a
great river. For than the mylne stonne gothe eight times about and the water
whele but ones / and every rong keeps his own cogge / et econtra. and
changes not on any side. And for a mean water six ro^ges and.xlii. cogges is
best. And for the over shot mylne six ro^ges and.xxxvi. cogges is best / For
the cogge whele may not be of so great a compase as the other cogge wheles be
/ And in all these pyckes / every cogge keeps his own ronge. And if ye put
in any whele a cogge or two cogges / mo or less: thanne as I have said. Than
shall every cogge change his ronge at all times / so that and it be not very
truly pycked it will not go well / and if it fortune to break a cogge as it is
like to do / it will than break many of them / except he shote down his
draught gate shortly / and likewise a wyndmylne. howbe it a wyndmylne has
never under.xlviii. cogges or.liiii. etc. but they must be so pycked / that
every cogge keep his own ronge / and seuyn ronges are not profitable for they
go latte lie. Of horse mylnes I do not speak of the making / for I have not
thexperience of them as I have of water mylnes.

Also the lords and their tenauntes have another manner of profit by reason of
these waters / over and beside these manner of mylnes or fysshinges / and that
is by reason of the watrynge of their catell and beestes both winter and somer
/ and specially of the rynnynge waters / as ryuers / brokes / sucches / and
welspringes / for they done syldome frese or never / and they will be cold in
somer and warm in winter / and if a close want water it has a great meame and
is much the worse.

Furthermore it is co^uenyent for a surueyour that when he has surueyed his
Lords lands / and seen what profytes and approwmentes may rise and be made
within the same / that he show his lord thereof and advise him to do it / and
to make the cost. For it is undoubted / that a man can not make no surer
purchase of any manner of land / better tytell / nor lighter cost / nor more
advantage to him self / than to improwe / amend / and make better / his own
old enherytaunce. I mean not by the heyghtnynge / reysyng / or increasyng of
the rentes of their tenauntes / but all only in mendyng and making better his
errable lands / meadows leyse / and pastures / and in making of water mylnes /
wyndmylnes / horse mylnes / fullyng mylnes / sithe mylnes / cutteler mylnes /
be it by water or draught of horses / smethy mylnes / or such other. And also
of getting of all manner of profytes / as well under the earth as above (as
before is remembered) in the sixth chapter.

And by the reason of these improwme^tes / me seems a man might make every
townshyppe that stands in the plain champyon country and occupied in tyllage
/ half as good again in all manner of profytes to the tenauntes as it was
before. If the lords thereof / and their tenau^tes can agree of the costs that
should be made thereof. And never a house nor cottage to be decayed nor let
down / and to have as much land in tyllage and plowing as there was before /
and their corn and grass should be better saved and kept from distroyeng.

How to make a townshippe that is worth twenty mark a year worth.xx. li. a
year. Cap. xli.
IT is undoubted that every townshyppe that stands in tyllage in the plain
country / there be errable lands to plowe and sow / and leyse to tie or
tedder their horses and mares upon / and commen pasture to keep and pasture
their catell / beestes / and sheep upon. And also they have medowe ground to
get their hey upon. Than let it be known how many acres of errable lands
every man has in tyllage / and of the same acres in every field to change
with his neighbors / and to ley them toguyder and to make him one several
close in every field / for his errable lands and his leyse in every field to
ley them toguyder in one field / and to make one several close for the^ all.
And also another several close for his porcyon of his commen pasture / and
also his porcyon of his medowe in a several close by it self / and all kept
in several both in winter and somer / and every cottage shall have his
portion assigned him acordyng to his rent. and than shall not the rich man
ouerpresse the poor man with his catell / and every man may eat his own
close at his pleasure. And undoubted / yt hay and straw that will find one
be in the house will find two beestes in the close / and better they shall
like For those beestes in the house have short here and thyn and toward
March they will pyll and be bare. And therefore they may not abide in the
field before the heerdman in winter time for cold. And those that lie in a
close under a hedge have long here and thycke / and they will never pyll nor
be bare. and by this reason the husband may keep twyse so many catell as he
did before.

This is the cause of this approument. Now every husband has six several
closes / whereof three be for corn / the fourth for his leyse / the fyfte for
his common pastures / and the sixte for his hay: and in winter time there is
but one occupied with corn. and than has the husband other five to occupy
till lent come / and than he has his falowe field / his ley field / and his
pasture field all somer. And wha^ he has mowen his medowe than he has his
medowe ground / so that and he have any weyke catell that would be amended /
or diverse manner of catell / he may put the^ in any close he will / the which
is a great aduau^tage. and if all should lie common / than would the edysshe of
the corn feldes and the aftermath of all the meadows be eaten in ten or xii.
days. And the rich men that has much catell / would have the advantage /
and the poor man can have no help nor relefe in winter / wha^ he has most
need. And if an acre of land be worth six pens or it be enclosed / it will
be worth eight pens when it is enclosed / by reason of the compostyng and
dongyng of the catell / that shall go and lie upon it both day and night. And
if any of his three closes that he has for his corn be worn or wax bare /
than he may break and plowe up his close that he had for his leyse / or the
close that he had for his commen pasture / or both and sow them with corn /
and let the other lie for a time / and so shall he have always reist ground /
the which will bear much corn with little dong. and also he shall have
great profit of the wode in the hedges when it is grown. and not all only
these profytes and aduauntages beforesayd / but he shall save much more than
all these: for by reason of these closes / he shall save meat / drink / and
wages of ashepeheerd the wages of the heerdman / and the wages of the swynheerd
/ the which may fortune to be as chargeable as all his hole rent / and also
his corn shall be better saved fro eating or distroyeng with catell. For dout
ye not / but heerdmen with their catell / shepeheerdes with their sheep / and
tyeng of horses and mares / distroyeth much corn / the which the hedges
would save. Paraduenture some men would say / that this should be against the
common weal / because the shepheerdes / heerdmen / and swyneheerdes / should
than be put out of wages. To that it may be answered / though those
occupacyons be not used / there be as many new occupacyons that were not used
before. As gettyng of quyckesettes / dyching / hedgyng / and plasshyng / the
which the same men may use and occupy. Also it may fortune men will say /
that and all should be enclosed / that there would be many foul lanes as there
be in Essexe: but for that there may be a prouycion / and that is thus. Where
the kings hye way is / if it be dry ground / stony ground / or sandy
ground / in all such places may be lanes made of a conuenyent bread / for the
kings people to pass through with all manner of carriage. And where it is soft
ground lyeng level / that the waters may not well pass by the dichesse / at
every hedge that gothe overthwart the hywaye there to make a gate / and stonne
it or gravel it in that place. And tha^ has every man the hole close to ride
/ carry / or go in / as they had before / Likewise as they do at the wind
gates a this side Chorley in Lancashyre / and likewise between town and town
/ and as to their own drifte lanes to their closes / let them make them for
their own ease as they will have the^. etc.

THe most indyfferentest mean to make these approume^tes / as me seems is
this All the lords of one town be there never so many / should be all of one
assente / that their tenauntes should exchange their lands one with another /
and the said exchange to stand and endure for ever / for doubt them not but
they know it best, and every tenant for his own advantage will do it
indifferently / and the curate of the same parysshe for his part. and every
lords bailey to be indyfferent to se these closes lotted and assigned to every
man's ease / so that every man may have one little crofte or close next to his
own house / if it may be / though he have no land of his own. This done /
let every lord by his copy of court role or by indenture / to make a
suffycient lease to every of their tenauntes / to have to him and to his wife
and to his children / so that it pass not three lives / than being a live and
named. yeldyng and payeng to their lords and to their heirs / the old rentes
and seruyces before due and accustomed / during those three lives / upon this
co^dycion. That they shall do or cause to be done during their lives /
sufficyently to quick set / dyche / hedge / and plasshe when need is / all
the said closes / and so keep the^ during their lives / the which will be a
great charge to the tenauntes. But yet me seems they may well do it if they
ente^de to thrife and specially do remember the profytes that may come to them
afterward. There is an old saying / quod leuis est labor cum lucro / that is
to say. That labor is light where winnyng follows. and much of this labor
may be done by him self and his servants at a co^uenyent time / so yt he let
not his husba^drie. It is to much to be done in one year two or three / but and
they may do it in six or nine years / as the feldes go about they hye them
well / for it is to costely for husbands to hyre it to be done. And the lords
/ me seems can do no less / than to grant them these three lives of the
old rent / remembering what profytes they may have at the end of their terms
/ they know not how soon. For undoubted on set day comes at last / and
though the aduau^tage of the lords come not anon it will come at length. And
therefore says the philosopher / Quod dffertur non aufertur / that thing that
is dyfferred is not taken away / and in the mean time the lords have no
manner of loss / nor yet make no costs but at their pleasure.
