A Pennyworth of good Counsel.
To Widows, and to Maids,
this Counsel I send free;
And let them look before they leap,
or, that they married be.
To the tune of Dulcima.


OF late it was my chance to walk
for recreation in the Spring,
Where as the fethered Quiristers,
melodiously aloud did sing;
and at that tide,
I there espide,
A woman fair, her hands sat wringing;
she wept apace,
and cried* alas;
My Husband has no forecast in him.
Quoth she, when as I was a Maiden,
I had store of Suitors brave,
And I most coyly did reject them,
to take the man that now I have;
but woe is me,
that ere I see
The face of him, makes me thus singing,
most heavily
I sing, and cry,
My Husband has no forecast in him.
His flattering tongue it did bewitch me,
fair promises to me he gave.
And said I should have all things plenty,
but no such thing I Am sure I have;
his purse is light,
nothing is right,
Although a portion I did bring him;
aye me poor soul,
thus to condole,
My Husband has no forecast in him.
He Is not the man I took him for,
alas, who would be so much tide?
I tell you friends now seriously,
my Husband he does naught but chide:
his looks are sour,
and he does lowre;
For Nature no good parts has gi'n him:
For which I grieve,
You may believe,
My Husband has no forecast in him.
When as he was a Batcheler.
then who but he amongst the Maids?
He went most neat in his apparel;
but now I find his glory fades:
so spruce he went,
would give content,
To any Maiden that could win him,
he would dance, and sing,
wrestle and ring;
But now he has no forecast in him.
Some Men unto their Wives are loving,
and all content to them do give;
But mine is lumpish sad and heavy,
which is the cause wherefore I grieve:
if I prove kind,
some fault he will find,
And says he knows where his shoe wrings him;
in dark, or light,
by day or night,
My Husband has no forecast in him.
The second Part,
To the same tune.


HE keeps me short of every thing,
no money he will give or lend;
It Is fitting sometimes that a woman
should with a friend some money spend:
I must sit here,
with heavy cheer,
Although that I did something bring him;
which makes me thus
to cry, alas,
My Husband has no forecast in him.
He does not use me like a Woman,
and does not care what clothes I have.
When other men's wives wear each fashion,
and are maintained rich and brave:
thus to the wall,
I may condole,
Although that this same song I sing him:
some counsel give,
me to relieve;
My Husband has no forecast in him.
Eringo-roots I do provide him.
which Cawdles made of Muscadine,
Yea, Marrow-bones and Oyster-pyes,
which all are dishes good and fine:
and Lobsters great,
for him to eat,
And yolks of Eggs; these have I gin him:
do what I can,
yet this same man
By no means will have forecast in him.
He will not have me go abroad,
yet seldom is himself at home;
He says that I must be a House-dove,
I must not fly abroad and come:
when other Wives,
do lead brave lives,
They Will go to Plays, hear Fiddlers singing,
and spend their Coin,
at Ale or Wine;
My Husband has no forecast in him.
Thus like the Turtle I sit mourning,
because I have an unkind Mate;
And fickle Fortune on me frowneth,
it is my destiny and fate:
I hope he will mend,
and be more kind,
With sweet embraces I will cling him;
I Will speak him fair
to have more care;
That he may have more forecast in him.
But if I see he will not mend,
come tell me Widow, Maid, or Wife;
What shall I do in this same woe?
for I am weary of this life:
my tongue I Will tune,
It shall chime noone,
And in his ears a peale I Will ring him;
I am put to it
and I will do it,
Because he has no forecast in him.
M. P.

FINIS.
