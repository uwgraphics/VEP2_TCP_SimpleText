The Fantastic age: OR,
The Anatomy of Englands vanity,
In wearing the fashions
Of several Nations,
With good exhortations,
Against transmutations.
To the tune of, O Women monstrous etc.


AVdience audience gallants all,
for here (as on a stage)
I Will show the postures, admiral strange
of this Fantastic age,
Wherein both sexes are grown
and Phebe-like they often change.
O monsters,
Neutrall monsters
leave these foolish toys.
Chamelion-like themselves they change
to any color seen,
How many several fashions strange
have here observed been
Within the circuit of few years,
as by experience truth appears.
O monsters,
Neutrall monsters,
leave these apish toys.
An English manor woman now
I Will make excuse for neither,
Composed are I know not how,
of many shreds together:
Italian, Spaniard, French, and Dutch,
of each of these they have at touch.
O monsters,
Neutrall monsters,
leave these apish toys,
The German and the drunken Dane,
the Persian and Polonian:
The Sunburned Ethiopian,
the Russian and Slavonian*
Our English imitate in clothes,
in drinking, drabbing, and strange oaths
O monsters,
Neutrall monsters,
leave these apish toys,
When meekness bore in England sway
and pride was not regarded,
Then virtue bore the bell away,
and goodness was rewarded
Now our fantastic innouations.
do cause prodigious transmutatio^s.
O monsters,
Neutrall monsters,
leave these apish toys.
Our men were in precedent days,
to manly actions bent.
They did not seek their names to raise
by clothes, and complement.
Now he is the man whose brave apparel
defends him in a Tauerne-quarrell.
O monsters,
Neutrall monsters,
leave these apish toys.
He thinks the Tailors should not choose
but grow exceeding rich,
Yet from them I hear no such news
though they go through stitch:
The reason's this, new clothes are made
before the old Bill is defraide.
O monsters,
Neutrall monsters, etc.
The second part,
To the same tune.


NOw many of both sexes go
each after^noone to the play,
Their rich Acoutrements to show
and do even what they may,
To note if they can any spy,
that put them downs in bravery.
O monsters,
Neutrall monsters,
leave these apish toys.
The women will not be at quiet,
their minds will still be crossed,
Til Husbands, Friends, or Fathers buy it,
what ever price it cost.
Thus wide mouthed pride insatiately,
deuoures all thoughts of piety.
O monsters,
Neutrall monsters,
leave these apish toys
And men that should more wisdom have
then the scayle Female sex,
As many fond inventions have,
nay rather they will annexe
Unto the story of their shame,
a higher style then women claim,
O monsters, etc.
Ungirt unblessed the proverb says,
and they to prove it right,
Have got a fashion now adays,
that's odious to the sight
Of those who love ciuility,
and hate this idle foppery.
O monster.
Neutrall monster,
leave these Apish toys.
Like Frenchmen all on points they stand
no girdles now they wear,
To spread this fashion through the land
The Hangman (as I hear)
When at four gates he hang four men
did wear just such a Dublet then.
O monsters etc.
If any thing may give them light
to see their vanity:
In my conceit that object might
make wise men to defy
A fashion that is held so base,
worn by the Hangman in disgrace.
O monsters etc.
Now to conclude, with all my heart
I wish that every one,
Would study on some better Art
and let vain pride alone:
Be as your good Forefathers were.
and let not vice thus domineere.
O monsters etc.
What you profusely do let fly,
in pride, in drink, and gain:
Spend in good hospitality,
'twill eleuate your fame
The prayers and praises of the poor,
shall cloathe your minds for evermore*
O monster,
Neutrall monsters,
leave these apish toys.
FINIS.
