The Revelation of God / and his great Propheatie.
The First Chapter.
THis is the Revelation Esa. 2. a. Joel. 2. c. Mich. 4. a.
last Time: and has brought the same reversed;with himself and with the
glorious Math. 24. c. 25. d.
Triumph of the Coming of his Christ and of all his Saints; Iudae. 1. b.
in Cleernes / to his elected Minister HN, which witnesses the Word of John.
17. c. Apo. 19. b.
God / the Truth and this Revelation / even as He has seen and heard
the same / and as it was showed unto him out of Heaven / To-thende that they all
which love God / also seek Him with Ier. 29. b.
whole Heart / and have a Lust Psalm. 40. a.
to do his Will / should become partakers of the same Cleernes of this heavenly
Revelation / or inioye thesame^ and so understand the Abac. 1. a. Act. 13. e.
Wonderful-woorkes of God / both of them which were wrought in times-passed /
and which also com-to-passe now in thissame Psalm. 118. c.
Day of the Love.

2. Happy are They / Apo. 1. a.
which read and hear the Words of this Revelation: and keepe-well by them /
all that which is written therein. For the Time Mark. 1. b. Luke 4. c.
is fulfilled / wherein all thatsame which God reversed;in Act. 3. c.
times-passed; has opened to his Ministers and Propheates reversed;to
com-to-passe in the tocoming-tyme; becomes eauen-now accomplished. It is very
true.

HN Elected of God and 1. Cor. 15. b. 1. Tim. 1. b.
his Grace / to a Minister of his holy and gracious Word / for to declare in
the Light reversed;under the Obedience of the Love; Romans 16. c. Ephesians. 1. a. 3.
a. Col. 1. c. 2. Tim. 1. b.
the Intelligence of the Truth of God / and the heavenly Revelation of the
godly Righteousness / eauenlike as God in times-passed promised the same / and
as also it was his Will / that it should Esa. 2. a. Joel. 2. c. Act. 2. b.
comtopasse now in the last Daye^ and become all Act. 3. c.
accomplished what-soeuer God has spoken through his holy Propheates / Angels
/ and through the Evangelists of Christ.

4. Superscription.
To the Lovers of the Truth / which love the upright Ephe. 4. c.
Beeinge of Jesus Christ, and that stand wel-mynded reversed;with all the
Saints of God; to the Romans 15. a. Ephe. 4. a.
Concord of Heart in the Love.

5. The Love Ephe. 6. c.
of God the Father / and the Spirit of his upright and lovely Being / be with
you all / in all Peace.

Jesus Christ; 1. Pet. 1. c. Gal. 4. a.
to his beloved Children / in the heavenly Beeinge / and replenished us with
al-maner of spiritual Ephe. 1. ^.
Blessings of his heavenly Riches. For thereunto has He chosen us / and made
us acceptable in his Love / unto him / that we reversed;in the same Blessinge
of his heavenly Goods; should be holy and Luke 1. ^. Ephesians. 1. a. 4. ^.
unreprovable before Him / to the Laud of his Grace and Glory. Amen.

The Second Chap.
I HN your Fellowe-brother in the Apoc. 19. b. 22. a.
Fellowe-witnes reversed;with all the Saints of God; of the true Beeinge of
God and Christ / was in the Land PIETAS, for to express the Honor and Love
of God / among all Those which men ought for to love.

2. Now whilst I thus reversed;in all Obedience of the Love; walked in Pietas,
I was combred very-much in my Thoughtes^ and in the Solitarines of my inward
Beeinge or Spirit / with the wonderful Works of God / for to understand in
my Spirit reversed;under the Obedience of the Love; the Wonderful-actes of God.
and in what maner-of-sort / God would accomplish his Works and his upright
Dan. 7. c. Math. 13. 25 d
Judgment, now in the last Time.

3. In thissame Comberment of mine / my Heart became 2. Cor. 4. ^.
lighted with Cleernes. and my whole inward Mind / was persed-thorowe with
Winds of Life and Delectable-sweetnes.

4. Fardermore / out of thissame Light and sweet Winds of Life / there appeered
unto me / a great, mighty, and glorious Beeinge: The Same opened my Heart /
and spread-fourth my inward Mind reversed;with itself; very wide and broad:
Yea / so wide / that the whole Heaven and the universal Earth / stood
comprehended therein.

Psalm. 11. a. 103. b.
as in a Seat: Esa. 6. a. 66. a Act. 7. f.
and He filled the whole Heaven / like-as a Man fills a Stool or Seat /
wher-in he sits. and with his Feet / He reached eauen unto the Earth / as
on his Foote-beanch: and reached-ouer euenso with his Feet / the universal
Earth. And thissame Revelation / multiplied itself reversed;to manifold
Shows; in my Sight: wher-through I humbled my whole Beeinge / before the Lord
and his glorious Majesty.

6. I rejoiced me also very-much; with great Thankes-geeuinge unto God; for
that reversed;through the same Revelation; the Day of the Lord reversed; Psalm.
118. c. Esa. 60. c. Apo. 22. a.
which shall endure for ever; was showed unto me for to behold: and that I
had reached or attained unto the same precious Dan. 8. 12. c. 4. Esdr. 13. f.
Time / wherein the great Acts of the wonderful Works of God / were showed
so nakedlie and cleerlie-vnto me. For with the same Revelation of God / there
was showed and revealed vnto^^ee / many and manifold wonderful Things and
Powers of God.

2. Tim. 1. b. Tit. 2. b.
the great Glory of God / and in thissame lively Demonstration or Shewinge of
the many and manifold Things / both of that which is in Heaven / and also of
that which is on Earth / so came-ther also unto me out of the same heavenly
Beeinge / Testimony-of-trueth, which distinctlie infourmed me of the
Diversity of things / and resolved me also reversed;with clear
Understanding; of the Things which I understood not / and were showed unto
me.

8. But truly / they are all strange and incredible Things / before the
Contemners of the heavenly Works of God / and 1. Cor. 1. 2. b 2. Cor. 4. a.
before all Understandings of ye Wisdom of the Fleash: But before the godly
Math. 11. c. 13. b.
Understandings / which reversed;under the Obedience of the Love; Luke 8. a.
have a regard on the Being of God and his Almightines / to a great Joy in
their Spirit / and to a great Thankes-geeuing to the highest God / because that
He the same God^ has manifested his Light / Life / and Wisdom / and the
Understanding of his secreat Works / among the Children of Men / upon the
Earth.

9. Moreover / in all this that I saw and Math. 11. C. 13. b.
heavenly Works of God / might be also declared among all Lovers of the
Truth and understood and loved by them / in their Understanding. And euenso
heer-withall / I endeavored myself to write-vp all the same / eauen so-much as
there was revealed unto me / and as was expedient or profitable to the Children
of Men for to know thereof: and so I wrote in Letters / what I had seen and
heard in this Revelation of God^ that Testimony-of-trueth said unto mee^ and
that I myself had spoken: euen-like as heer-on follows.

The Third Chap.
Pietas: and that I sawe-into the magnificent Powers of his Wonderous-woorkes /
so cried I then to the Lord / and said:

2. O wonderful Power / Spirit / and Wisdom: Esa. 45. c.
O thou secreat God of Heaven: How unknown are thy Works / Sap. 9. b. Math.
11. c. Romans 11. d. 1. Cor. 2. b.
and how secreat is thy Wisdom / before all Wisdoms of the Fleash: and how
far does the Intelligence of thy holy Spirit / differ from the Wise of the
World and their Scripture-learned!

3. For who is-ther of all Those / that Sap. 9. b. Romans 11. d.
can understand thy Mind / Spirit / or Meaning / or anywhat of thy Purpose
and Counsel: ether-yet find reversed;with all his Searchinge; the Day of thy
Judgment / or reversed;through his Studyinge and Practisinge in the Knowledge;
comprehend the same? Verelie not anyone.

Tob. 3. a.
and true. For all those which Romans 8. a. 1. Cor. 8. a.
are good-thinkinge-wise / against Thee and thy Service of Loue^ and Romans 2. a.
2. Tess. 2. b.
unbelieving toward thy gratio^s Word / and the Testimonies of thy holy
Spirit of Love / together with all those which Ephe. 4. b.
are Strangers to thy Beeinge^ and not essentialli^ godded John. 6. f. 17. c.
with thee / in their Spirit / or that despise the same Codeifyinge or
Vnyting-to-god / shall all no-dowt find themselves begiled / in their
good-thinking Understanding Romans 1. c.
or Knowledge reversed;which they suppose / to be a Wisdom of God / or Gift
of the holy Spirit; / also stomble therein and fall / and reversed;how
knowledgfull / and how wel-learned so-euer they be in the Languages and
Scriptures; miss the upright Truth and Wisdom of God.

5. But reversed;O my God; Exo. 3. ^. Esa. 66. a.
Thou art the same that thou art. In Thee is the Truth: and thou ma^est
likewise the same John. ^. c. 14. b.
known unto Thine / which love thee.

6. Thou stand firm for ever / unchangeable or immovable / eauen as a
Esa. 26. a.
Stonie-rocke: For thy Strength / Wisdom / and Esa. 46. a.
Purpose / does neuermore fail. Therefore suerlie / thy Judgments / and all
thy Works / Tob. 3. a. Apo. 15. a.
are only true. For nether in thy Judgment / nor-yet in any of all thy Works
/ shall thou be made-ashamed.

7. But now in thissame Day / all Fleash of Adam reversed;which according to
the Mind of his fleashlie Understanding / will judge thy Works / Wisdom / and
Purpose; shall be Sap. 5. a.
made-ashamed / and be brought to reproach / before Thee reversed;O God; and
before thy Truth.

8. (Yea / they shall all now reversed;in thissame Day; which will take upon
them / with their Counsel and Math. 11. c. 1. Cor. 1. b. Romans 8. a.
Ingenious-prudentie of the Knowledge / to seeke-after / search-out / and
understand ether-yet judge / Gods secreat Counsel / Wisdom / and Will /
ronne-to-an-ende in their Knowledge of God-his Matiers.)

9. For now reversed;O God; in the Reuealinge of thy Truth
reversed;wher-through the Misvnderstandinge of all Men of Adam / becomes
witnessed unto them / and is geeuen them to see-into; they must all needs
acknowledge / Sap. 5. a.
that they have missed the upright Understanding of thy Trueth^ and
transgressed brutishlie against the Testimonies of the same / To-thende that
they might euenso confess their Errour^ Judith. 8. c. 1. Pet. 5. a.
humble them under thy holy Majesty / and under the gracious Word of the
Service of thy Love. honor thy Glorious-lordlynes^ Math. 6. b.
hallowe or magnify thy Name^ and understand and comprehend thy
Wonderous-woorkes / and the Day of thy righteous Judgment / a-right / and
according to the Truth.

Math. 11. c. 13. b.
understand the Secreatnes of thy Works. and that also thy Work / is not
broken / but Genesis 1. d. 2. a
perfect. For if they sawe-into and understood all thy Works / according to
the Truth / so could not also then thy Will / be Judith. 16. c. Romans 9. b.
resisted by them thy Spirit of Propheaties / 1. Tess. 5. b.
disanulled or queanched-out^ nor thy Counsel of Wisdom distrusted. but thy
Word should in euery-behalf be beleeued^ and the Requiringe of the same
reversed;with good-willing Hearts; obedientlie 1. Pet. 1. b.
ensued.

11. But now in this Day of thy Appeering reversed;O God; in thy Math. 24. d.
25. d. Iudae. 1. b.
Glorious-maiestie / thou will not Act. 10. c. Romans 2. b.
respect any-man in his Wisdom. nor-yet also make-account of anyones
Vnbeleeuingnes: but thou will bringe-fourth the Right Esa. 28. b. 32. a. 42. a.
with the Truth: also show thy wonderful Works reversed;which are secreat
before all earthly Wise; to the Math. 11. c. 13. b.
Littelones and Humble of Heart: and euenso execute thy upright Judgment
reversed; Psalm. 94. b. 1. Cor. 1. 2. b.
against all Understandings / Wisdoms / and Scripture-learned of this World;
over the World. But the same will sound Abac. 1. a. Act. 13. d.
very strange or monsterous before the Ears of all those which understand
nor believe not reversed;O God; thy Works.

12. Therefore it is suerlie eauen-now reversed;before all Psalm. 118. c. Abac.
1. a.
wonderful Work / that thou reversed;O God; do work and accomplish in
thissame Day of thy Love. Esa. 53. a. Romans 10. b.
For who shall reversed;I say; believe it / when as it is told him?

13. Yea / who is-ther of all the Children of Men /
that would once have thought such a matier / namely: that thy Life / Romans 5.
6. ^. 1. Cor. 15. e.
out of the Death / thy Light / out John. 1. a. 2. Pet. 1. b.
of the Darkness / thy Understanding / out of the Simplenes / and thy Wisdom /
out of the Foolishnes / should so have been made-knowen! and that thou moreover
/ out of a foolish People reversed; Ozeae. 2. a. Romans 9. c.
that was not thy People; would prepare thee an acceptable People / that
accomplisheth all thy Will: and that thou do likewise / through thy Power and
Almightines (eauen-like as it in this present Day appears) bring thatsame
to light / which seemed before all the Eyes of Men / to be Math. 19. c. Luke 1.
d.
impossible for to com-to-passe.

The Fourth Chap.
Psalm. 11. a. 89 b. 103. b.
Seat of the Lord: which the Godhead so thoroughly Esa. 66. a. Ier. 13. a.
filled / that there was no-wheare any empty Place to be found / throughout
the whole Heaven. Consideringe now heeron / I thought in my Heart: O supreme
Godhead! Thou fillest the whole Heaven. Whea^e is then reversed;I beseech thee;
the Habitation or Place of thy Saints?

2. Now whilst I thus was combred heer-withall / in my Thoughts / there
appeered unto me from Heaven reversed;out of the Beeinge of the Godhead;
Testimony-of-trueth. and said unto me: Thou look only on the Heaven / the
Seat of the Lord, and not reversed;in circuit round-about; on the Multitude
of all the Heavens of God-his heavenly Kingdom / wher-in also God does live
gloriously / and is also all in all in the same.

/ with his Godhead: and yet it was all one-with-the-other / like-as one Heaven
/ and as one great glorious God.

4. Then asked I Testimony-of-trueth: What are reversed;I pray thee; all the
Thowsandes of thesesame Heavens / wherein God lives and triumphs so
gloriously and through-lightinglie: Apo. (...)
and that rejoice them all with each-other so triumphantile / in the Light /
Word / and Life of God: and that also with God reversed;from the Heaven /
eauen unto the Earth; Ie^. 1^. ^.
reach euerye-wheare over the universal Earth / round-about the Lords Feet:
and yet nevertheless reversed;they all together; are joined one to-another and
one in-another; as one Heaven; eauen unto the Highest with the Godhead.

5. THen said Testimony-of-trueth unto Romans 12. b. 1. Cor. 12. c. Ephesians. 4. b.
Body / with his many Members. namely / all the Saints or Holyones of God
/ Leui. 26. ^ 2. Cor. 6. ^.
wherein God dwells and lives.

6. Which one Body reversed;with the many Multitudes of his Members; Apo. 5.
22. b.
reigns with God: and bears euenso his Dominion with God. Therefore it is
named Ge^. 32. ^.
ISRAEL.

7. Thissame heavenly Body reversed;with all his Members; is also justified
Ephe. 5. c. Apo. 1. b. 7. ^. ^1.^.
or cleansed from the Sin. and is likewise reversed;to his Salvation and Joy
in the everlasting Life; Act. 2. a. 3. John. 2. c.
anointed with the Holie-spirit of God. Therefore it is also Romans 8. a. Gal. 5.
c.
called / Christian.

8. When I now had once heard and understood thissame / I marueiled ther-at
very-much: and demanded yet farther / whether that thosesame Holyones / were
the Generations of Abraham, and the Children of God and Christ/ Genesis 22. b.
Ier. 31. d. John. 1. b.
according to the Promises of God the Father / and the Testimonies of ye
Scriptures / of the holy Propheates and Evangelists.

Testimony-of-trueth unto me: Yea / they are the-same. Howbeit / the Woorking
of God touching These / has evermore Esa. 29. b. Abd. 1. 1. Cor. 1. b.
rested-secreat before the Wise of ye World: but according to the Will of God
the heavenly Father / they have been always; through his Light of Life / and
of the heavenly Truth; showed and made-knowen / unto the Esa. 57. 66. a Math.
11. c.
Humble and Single-mindedones / which reversed;with whole Heart; Psalm. 40. a.
had a Lust to accomplish the Will of the Lord.

10. Then said I: O my Lord / infourme me I pray thee / in what-sort / and
also from whence / all these Multitudes Apo. 7. a.
of Saints / are com or grown to such-amaner of heavenly Beeinge: and how
that the World / and all Generations of the Earth / Genesis 22. b.
shall obtain their Blessinge and Salvation / which is promised unto them /
according to the Testimony of the holy Scripture. For in my Thoughts, I am
also combred heer-with.

The V. Chap.
AFter-that spoke Testymonye-of-trueth, Math. 11. c. 13. b.
Secreat-misterie of the same reversed;wher-after thou demaundest; shall be
declared unto Thee / above Many in this World. For thy Heart has forsaken
the earthly Consumeablenes / and reversed;entering into the 4. Esdr. 7. b.
Math. 7. b.
Way to the Immortality; powred-fourth his Understanding / before the Truth
of God / for to comprehend Wisdom / and the Things / wherthrough the Genesis 22.
b.
Blessinge and Salvation of Men is to be obtained.

2. Behold / God has in times-passed / Genesis 12. a. 17. b. 22. b.
foreseen and elected to him an holy People / out of Abraham, for to seal or
sett-fast his Covenant reversed;to a Token of his People; in the same /
To-thend that He / through the same People reversed;to ye Blessing of all
Generations of the Earth; would establish his Promises / made unto Abraham.
Which Promises of God reversed;through Abraham and all Gods holy Propheates
and Evangelists; have not hitherto in any One; of all whatsoever has been
promised by God; Esa. 44. c. 46. a.
once failed / but it is all com-to-passe. Howbeit / the Lords Mind and his
Purpose reversed;what He therewith would accomplish / at the very-last; has
Dan. 12. c.
remained secreat before Many.

3. Notwithstanding / it is permitted me / that I reversed;touching
That-thinge which has Math. 11. c. 13. b. 1. Cor. 2. b.
hitherto rested-secreat / before the Understandings of Men; should uncover
the Mind of the Lorde^ and also declare the Truth reversed;of the same; unto
Thee HN.

Abraham; would reveal Genesis 18. b.
his holy Mind / Will / and Purpose / on the Earth^ and bring-fourth
reversed;through the same; the Genesis 12. a. 15. 17. 22. b.
Blessinge of all Generations of the Earth. Which Seed of Abraham reversed;for
the Promises cause; was first procreated Genesis 17. b. 21. a. b.
after the Fleash / upon the Earth. Therefore was also the same Generation
reversed;in his former Procreatio^; Romans 9. a. Gal. 4. c.
ISRAEL after ye Fleash.

5. The-whilst now that this said Israel / did yeat bear the fore-passing
Procreation according to the Fleash / in him: and that also many People / did
not know nor understand ye heavenly Truth of God according to the Spirit
reversed;wherein the promised Blessing becomes inherited; / So has the Lord
reversed;the God of Abraham Exodus 20. etc.
geeuen a Law or Ordinance unto the People of Israel. and out of the same
Generation / Exo. 28. 29. Leui. 1. 2. 3.
ordained also unto him a Priesthod: wher-vnder that they (the-whylst that they
were Fleash and fleashlie-minded / and had not yeat attained unto the
Seconde-birth / John. 3. a.
according to the Spirit and heavenly Truth) Gal. 3. c. 4. a
were sustayned^ and kept through the same / from the Estraunginge from their
God / till that the Time was fulfilled / that God reversed; Luke 1. c. 2. a
through the Mightie-power of his Holie-spirit; procreated his true Being and
spiritual Seed reversed;which took on him the Seed of Abraham; out of the
forementioned Seed of Abraham: And euenso / out of the same Seed of Abraham /
God manifested his beloved Son / in Israel, euen-like as God reversed;through
his holy Propheates; had Esa. 9. a. Ier. 23. a. Dan. 9. c.
fore-saide and promised the same / To-thend that He would eue^so
reversed;through the same Seed of his spiritual and heavenly Procreation;
confirm or fulfill reversed;according to his Truth; the Genesis 22. b.
Blessinge and Salvation / which God had promised / out of the Faith of Abraham.

6. Behold / This would God: and the same Psalm. 32. b.
Fruit of his Loynes] should become manifested^ also heard and believed of all
the Generations of Mankind / to their Salvation and Blessing / according to
the Promises^ and they likewise reversed;through the same; John. 3. a. Romans 6.
a. Ephe. 4. c.
renewed in their Spirit and Mind. Which upright Procreation of the Godlynes /
comes out of ye Faith / Romans 1. a. b. 4. b.
through the Faith / and in the Faith of Abraham.

7. These Promises Genesis 12. a. 13. 15. b.
were made to Abraham / ereuer that there was a Seed borne unto him. But
afterward / when as Abraham had once received the Promise of the Seed / and
that the Fruit could live / Genesis 21. b.
there was a Son brought-fourth unto him / namely, Isaac.

8. Howbeit / thissame former Procreation according to the Fleash reversed;
Gal. 4. c. d.
whose Children were not free / but were all under the Law; had the
Fore-goinge / and Exo. 1. 2. 3.
increased them to a great People / under the Law of the Lord.

Gal. 4. a.
fulfilled / that the Lords heavenly Procreation y^ Seed of Abraham
according to the Spirit? was borne either brought-fourth on the Earth / Luke 2.
a.
and euenso manifested itself reversed;of the Stock of David; out-of the Faith
of Abraham, to the Blessing of all the Generations of the Earth: Wher-through
the Spirit and Mind of the Lord reversed;how his Counsel and Will was of
the same; was made-manifest in Israel. and wher-through there was also published
to the same People Israel / Esa. 42. 61. a. Luke 1. f. 4. b.

THissame Son of God / Jesus Luke 1. c. 2. a

there stands written: Exo. 23. c. Deu. 7. b.

2. Wher-out now it seems according to the Fleash / as-though his Genealogy
reversed;after the Procreation of the Generations of Israel; Deu. 25. a. Ruth.

6. Behold: This is the same Son of Math. 25. d. Iudae. 1. b.

that is full of all Iniquity; is extending over us Littelones and Poor: and
for that He also reuealeth to us so nakedlie / and lets us see / Ephesians. 1. a.

horrible Beeinge of the Sin / which we; eauen as Men distraught; have
feruently-loued^ and Apo. 18. a. b
served the same with our Minds and Understandings. and incorporated
our-selues so wholly ther-into / that we by that occasion / have not esteemed
Thee reversed;O God; nor-yet thy Righteousness / for anything-worth: and yet
thou reversed;in more-aboundaunce of thy Grace; profferest thy Love / together
with thy Power and Mightines / unto us / for to renew us reversed;through the
John. 4. 7. ^
outflowing Waterstreames of thy gracious Word / and Testimonies of thy holy
Spirit / and Service of Love; in our Understanding: and so to release us
reversed;in the Obedience of thy Love; from the Iniquity / to raise us up
from the Death of Sin / Romans 6. 8. b 1. Cor. 6. b. 2. Cor. 4. b.
and to make us lyuinge again in Thee.

6. This is now assuredly reversed;O God; a great Romans 9. b. 1. Pet. 1. c.
procreate thy Children reversed;through the holy Spirit of the Love of thy
Christ; out of the Sinfullest, Ozeae. 2. a.
Vncleanest, and Ignorantest of all: and that thou moreover / adioynest
thosesame Children of thy Love reversed;as thy Seed of Abraham, and as
Fellowe-bretheren of Israel; to the House of Jacob, and make them glorious
with Israel.

7. At thissame great Grace of thine / extended so lovely over all sinful
Generations reversed;whereby they might without fail / become rid and Math.
1. c.
saved from their Sinnes^ and preserved from the horrible Destruction; I cannot
reversed;O God; wonder sufficiently.

8. When As I now had ended this my Talking / before the Most highest / then
spoke Testimony-of-trueth again unto me / and said: Wonder not thou so
greatly at the great Love / Grace / and Mercy of God / extended over the
Children of Men: For God is John. 1. c. 2. Cor. 1. a.
full of all Grace and Mercy: but wonder thou rather that the Man / in all
thissame remains so Esa. 48. a. Ier. 5. a. 6. c.
hardened of Heart and Mind / that he Mat. 22. b. Luke 14. b.
respects not Gods proffered Grace / and his entire or hearty Love / to his
Preservation: but contemns the same / and disdayneth the Louelynes of the
Peace / or makes himself unworthy of the same: and euenso chooses to bear
reversed;in the wicked Kind of the ungodly Being; the Romans 2. a. 2. Tess. 1.
a.
Misery of the Ungodly. and to inherit all Vnluck / Death / Hell / and
Condemnation / Math. 13. d. 25. d. 2. Pet. 3. b.
in the hellish Fire / rather then thatsame lovely Beeinge of God / which is
proffered unto him / in the Service of the Love.

Pro. 1. e. 2. Cor. 6. a.
Grace^ his safe-making Service of Loue^ and his heavenly Works Abac. 1. a.
Act. 13. d.
in the Spirit^ as also the Testimonies of his holy Spirit of Love (wherewith
they prepare the 2. Pet. 2. a.
Condemnation unto themselves) yet see I nevertheless / that ye Love of God /
and Favor of Grace / remains still over the Man: and that the Man's
Destruction and Condemnation (although the Man reversed;by reason of the
Iniquity; Romans 5. 8. a.
is Gods Enemy) Eze. 18. c. 2. Pet. 3. b.
is grievous unto Him / either pitieth him. For with ye great Patience of God
extended over the Man / are the Romans 9. b.
Vessels of Wrath brought-fourth / to Condemnation. And that is it which moves
me for to wonder.

10. Yet notwithstanding / I rejoice me also again / in the Mercy of God /
and for his Eccli. 5. a. 2. Pet. 3. b.
great Longe-sufferinge: Wher-through yet Certain do turn them from the
Iniquity / and euenso reversed;under the Obedience of the Love; Romans 2. a. 2.
Cor. 6.
respect-well the Grace of God / to their Salvation.

11. Therefore truly is thissame Time reversed;before all 2. Cor. 6. a.
godly Time / of abundance of Grace. For I see / that God does now in
thissame Day / accept or receive the most-abhominable Sinners reversed;which
are unworthy of any Grace; very graciously reversed; Luke 7. 15. b.
in the Repentance for their Sins; in his Love / also forgeeueth their
Sins / and accepts them worthy / for to live with Him reversed;in the
Communialtie of the Love of his Holyones; in Luke 1. f. Ephesians. 1. a. 4. c
all lovely Righteousness.

12. This do we now behold reversed;right evidently; with our Eyes / that
God does now reversed;in thissame Day of his Love; set-vpp his lovely
Righteousness among the most-abhominable Sinners. and farther does reversed;in
the Service of his Love; accomplish That / which; in appeeraunce; Math. 19. d.
seems impossible for to com-to-passe / so that it cometh-to-passe or
taketh-effect. Thissame is reversed;assuredly; verytrue / and a superaboundant
Grace of God.

The IX. Chap.
The Laud and Magnifying of the Grace of God, thorough HN.
over all those which love Thee / for thy Righteousnesses cause! For those-same
(albeit that they have inherited the Job. 17. b. Psalm. 18. a.
Condemnation reversed;in their Conscience; for the Sins cause^ and so feel
or taste the hellish Fire and all Indignation / euen-like as there appertains
to the Ungodly / or as they are worthy of the same) do thou Deu. 32. d. 1.
Reg. 2. a. Tob. 13. a. Sap. 16. b.
leade-fourth out of all their Misery / and cleansest them from all their
Sins: lettinge them taste and feel the Delectable-sweetnes of thy heavenly
Beeinge.

2. Thou bear also those-same before thy Bosom / Esa. 40. 66. b
in thine Arms: and bring them / as thy beloved Sheep reversed; Eze. 34.
c. John. 10. b.
whom thou have found strayinge^ and allured again unto thee / through the
Service of thy Love; to the upright constant Sheep / in thy House of Israel.

3. Therefore must I yeat say reversed;as before; that God does now in thissame
Day reversed;through the ouerflowinge Grace of his Love / and through the
Omnipotentie of his mostholie Beeinge; bringe-fourth the Purest / out of the
Most-vncleane / the Liuingest / out of the Most-deadlie / and the Sauedest /
out of the Most-condemned: and makes euenso of his cheifest Enemies / Romans 5.
b.
his loueliest Frindes: also brings those that were most-fardest from Him,
most-neerest unto Him: and they which have been reversed; ler. 2. d. 3. a.
even as unfaithful Members of an unfaithful Espowsed-wife; most-vnfaithfull
unto Him / Those does He now make faithful / Ozeae. 2. a.
and accepts or receaueth them for his Best-beloued.

4. WHo should have thought that an adulterous Ier. 3. a.
have obtained such a Grace at her Husbands hands / as that She (inasmuch as
she reversed;with her whoorish Lusts and unchaste Desires; had turned her
away from her Husband / Ezec. 16. 23.
and committed her Whordom with so many Strangers) should be received again
of her Husband / for such a beloved Wife. and that He should let her know
reversed;in the Service of his Love; so thoroughly his Mind and Will: Yea / so
Ier. 3. a. b.
to hang or addict his Heart and Love on her again / as if she had never ben
turned-away from Him.

5. Truly / this is to be reconed for a special and an abundant Grace /
wherein men have greatly to wonder. For who should any-waye have thought / that
an adulterous Wife / should in such-sort have been cleansed from her Whoordom^
and made so faithful and meet reversed;in the Obedience of the Requiring of
the Service of Love; for to bring-fourth all good Fruits?

6. NOw with this my Wonderinge heereat

7. But when I had a little heald me still heerin / then spoke
Testimony-of-trueth unto me / and said: Rest thyself now from all this
Wonderinge / in thy Thoughts: and take good-heede unto all that which is
showed thee here / in the Land Pietas. For in the same / God will yeat reveal
unto thee and let thee see / many secreat Things / Esa. 64. c. 1. Cor. 2. a.
which have never ben seen of Man's Eyes / nor heard of his Ears.

Esa. 30. a. b
hold thee still now before the Lord / and be bold / and fear not: but have
a good regard unto all that which becomes showed unto thee here / of the
secreat Works of God / that thou may rightly know and well understand
all the same. For the Mind of the Truth of all thissame / shall not be
kept-secreat from Thee / nor from any of all those which are one Heart and
Mind with thee / but Math. 11. c. John. 14. b.
be all made-knowen / and declared according to the Truth.

9. Heerwith I thanked the Lord with Joy / for all thissame great Grace
extended over all People that love the Truth: and I endeavored myself for to
do euenso / as there was said unto me.

The X. Chap.
Testimony-of-trueth, I looked-about over all the Heavens / as over a Esa. 2.
a. Mich. 4. a.
very-great Mountain. Also I looked down al-ouer the universal Earth. and
behold: On the Earth / there were euery-wheare many little Esa. 2. b.
Hills: as also besides that / many Valleis or Lowe-places.

2. Now as I looked vpwardes into ye Heavens I saw by the Multitudes of many
Heavens / a very-mightie and steadfast Esa. 9. a.
Peace / and a Can. 8. a.
strong Love / which was not to be broken nor rent. and a fair Light of the
Day reversed;of an exceeding passinge Cleernes; which Esa. 60. c. Apo. 21. 22.
a.
never changed / and after the which also no Night ensued.

3. But as I looked down on the Earth / I saw and heard by all ye Multitude
of little Hills / always a great Sound of a Hurringe-noyze / with Math. 24.
a. 4. Esdr. 13. d. 15. b.
much Variaunce and Dissension: And that for the most-part / because that
each-one of the little Hills, would enforce him to be the best and lordliest
on the Earth.

4. Also there was by them all / verie-little Light. For those-same Lights
which they had by them / were all of little Light / and of small Power. and
also very chaungeable into Darknesses. And for that cause also / the
Darknesses or Nights / were theare much-more and longer / then the Lights or
Days.

5. After that I had once throughlie-vewed Esa. 2. a. Mich. 4. a.
Mountain of the Multitudes of many Heavens / which were together with
each-other / so wholly peaceable and conformablie-vnyted with the Godhead.

6. NOw as I considered heeron / I saw. and behold: This great Esa. 2. a.
Mich. 4. a.
Mountain of all Heavens with the whole Deity / opened itself abroad very
wide and lardge: and ther-out there came One fourth / Apo. 12. a.
like-vnto a Woman / whose Body was eauen as a Gods Body / or as a spiritual
heavenly Man's.

7. Thissame gaue-fourth her-self so great and glorious / that she
stretched-out her-self over all Heavens / and also in all Heavens: and she was
and remained consubstantiated with the Deity / and with all Heavens. And with
the Cleernes of her Body, she gaue-light in all Heavens / and over the
universal Earth. for her Body was Apo. 12. a.
in Cleernes / brighter then the Sun.

Job. 11. c. Esa. 57. b.
and vehement Wind / and blewe with a vehement Power on the Earth: in
such-sort / that the Earth and all Hills on the Earth / Psalm. 18. a.
trembled thereat.

9. Moreover / this vehement or firce Wind / intermelled itself Infra. 13. c.
among all the Hills / on the Earth: Psalm. 1. a. Esa. 2. b. 5. c. 29. a. 41.
b. Dan. 2. d. e.
and brake them all to-peeces / and ground them to small Poulder or Dust.

10. This Dust spred-abrode itself reversed;as a dry or barren Sand; al-ouer
the Valleis or Lowe-places / and over all the Fatt-places of the Earth. Wher-of
the Earth became altogether dry / Amos. 8. a.
and unfruitful of Corn: Lam. 1. 2. 3. Math. 24. b.
in such-sort / that reversed;by that occasion; the People reversed;which
inhabited the Earth; were very-sore afflicted with Hunger and Thirst: and
suffered also in-part / great and deadly Smart.

11. When I now had well beheld thissame / I mourned greatly over the Misery
of the People / that inhabited the Earth. For I pitied much their Hunger and
Thirst. Ier. 14. a. Lam. 2. 4. a. ^.
and that there was no Corn nor Bread any-wheare on the Earth / to the
Satisfyinge of their Hunger / nor Water to the Quenching of their Thirst.

The XI. Chap.
AFter-that I saw. and behold: Apo. 19. b.
the Word of God / and the true Math. 4. a. John. 6. ^.
Bread and Water Esa. 12. a. John. 4. 7. d. Apo. 21. 22. b.

2. With the same Word / she cried reversed;with loud Voice; to all hungry
and thirsty People on the Earth / to-thende that they all should harken unto
the Distinction of her Voice^ and reversed;to all their Consolation; Esa. 55.
^. Math. 7. c. Iam. 1. c.
do ther-after^ and so become satisfied with her Bread and Water of Life. But
of all those which dwelled on the Earth / there were very feawe which would

Nevertheless her Voice was Can. 2. 4. a.
very sweet and lovely: and her Voice sounded euen-thus / and said:

3. COm hither to Me / Esa. 55. a. Pro. 9. a. Eccli. 51. d. Apo. 22. b.
all ye hungry and thirsty Souls / so shall ye then find all that by Me
/ which ye desire. For by Me is the Bread / unto Life / John. 6. ^.
for to feed all hungry Hearts ther-with. and the John. 4. b. 7. d. Apo. 22.

Water of Refreashinge / for to relieve all thirsty Souls ther-with.

4. Com hither now all I pray you / who / or of what Nation of People so-euer
ye be. For by Me is all Sweetness / Esa. 55. a. Eccli. 24. c.
Milk / Honnie / Wine / and Oil. also all Riches / and Joy / and ther-to /
the everlasting Life.

Psalm. 95. b. Heb. 3. a.
hardened their Hearts somuch-the-more ther-against: and withdrewe them from
thissame living Voice / that spoke unto them from Heaven. And Pro. 1. c.
refusinge the proffered Grace / they turned them to the Wise of the Earth /
which also cried all alyke verie-lowde unto them: Howbeit / with Division
against each other.

6. And although that these Wise of the Earth / had thus reversed;eueryone
against each-other; contrary Minds / and divided Understandings / yet cried
they all nevertheless eauen-alike reversed;as with one-maner of Voice; and
said:

7. Fetch Bread / fetch Bread / here out of these our Maundes. and eat: Ier.
8. 14. a. 18. 23. c. d.
Fetch Water / fetch Water / here out of these our Pitchers. and drink: and
be one with Us. Turn not yourselues to any other Bread nor Water / that ye be
not there / through seduced.

8. But reversed;alas; Ezec. 13. b. 4. Esdr. 6. c.
they had all empty Maundes / and void Pitchers / that had nothing in them.
For-that-cause also / the poor People remained wholly destitute and
unsatisfied / both of Bread and Water: Esa. 41. b. Ier. 14. a. Lam. 2. 4. c.
and understood ne perceived not / where the Satisfying of their Hunger / ye
Quenching of their Thirst / the Comfort of their Life / nor-yet the Appeasment
of their Hearts / was to be found.

9. Moreover the same Woman cried with John. 6. c. d.
cometh-downe from Heaven: nether do also the John. 4. b. 7. d.
living Waters / flow from their Bodies. Therefore also ye find not by them
any Food / to the Life: Ier. 23. c. d. Ezec. 13. b. Math. 24. c. 2. Pet. 2. a.
but they seduce you / and bring you into strange Ways / and in much Misery
and Smart.

10. How remain ye thus-longe / so Pro. 1. b.
void of Understanding: and wherefore suffer ye yourselues to be yeat
continually seduced of the earthly Wise? Consider reversed;I pray you; how
that there is not any upright brotherly Love / Concord / Esa. 48. ^7. b.
nor-yet Peace / among them.

11. Seeing then that they themselves are yeat vnregenerated^ and not
incorporated into that one
peaceable Heart and upright Mind of my Beeinge: but deale-hypocriticallie
toward the same / or separate them therfrom / and rest Math. 24. b.
divided against each-other: and cannot therefore have any true Love among
each-other^ any upright brotherly Familiaritie^ nor without Faynednes / any
Peace or Concord / So consider and judge it then now yourselues / how they
should anywaye be able for to bring you / to the right brotherly Love and
Familiaritie^ and to that one upright Heart of the Love and Peace either
Concord.

12. They cry all reversed;no-dowt; lowde-enough: Here / Math. 24. c. Luke

It is heer-after.

Heb. 3. 4. b.
nor believe not my Voice / nor humble you obedientlie unto my Requiringe / so

That which the earthly Wise do set-fourth before you / or call you unto. But
he which this-daye hears and believes Me / and comes unto me / Esa. 55.
a. Math. 11. c.
shall find all that by me which is Gods and Christ's, and concerns his
Salvation.

14. Therefore com now all unto Me / Math. 11. c.
in your Bourdensomnes / and ye shall be eased and comforted^ and find by Me
/ the true Christ your Savior also the Righteousness / Eccli. 24. b.
the Life / the Rest / and the Peace: for I am full thereof: But the Earth and
all her Wise / are utterly Esa. 29. b. Abdi. 1. 1. Cor. 1. b.
void and unfruitful of the same.

15. Com now all ye that are hungry / Apo. 2.

I bring unto you out of Heaven / so shall ye then become satisfied and live.

16. Com now all ye that are thirsty / Esa. 55. a

20. NOtwithstanding / in all thissame Louelye-alluringe of the Voice / which
so let itself be heard reversed;out of Heaven; on the Earth / the Men which
dwelled on Earth / would not Ier. 2. b. John. 3. b. c.

Foolishnes of the ignorant earthly Wisdom / then to respect thissame proffered

thatsame moved me more for to wonder far-away / then all the reast wher-at I

turned into Silence: and were as the Esa. 59. b.
Dead / which do nether see, hear, nor feel. And ther-with I turned my Sight

thee; com upon the World and the Men, in thissame Silence as the Dead?

2. After-that / I looked / and behold: The Godhead opened his Side / on his
Right-hande: and in the same Side / I saw seven clear Lights: and each Light
in-seuerall / was in Cleernes very bright. These Lights stood in-course
reversed;as on-a-rewe; one-by-another / as being ready to appear on the Earth
/ and to geeue-light on the Face of the Earth / with their Cleernes.

Cleernes on the Earth. Howbeit / the Man saw nor knew not the Cleernes of

/ the Man had no regard to the Cleernes of the second Light.

5. After-that appeered the third Light / on the Earth: and gave reversed;from
God and out-of God; his Light and Cleernes on the Earth. Howbeit / the Man was
not aware of the same / for to perceive the Cleernes of the third Light.

8. After-that appeered the sixth Light / on the Earth: and gave reversed;from
God and out-of God; his Light and Cleernes on the Earth. Howbeit / the Man knew
not the Cleernes of the sixth Light.

9. After-that came-fourth the seventh Light: And I saw / and behold: The
perfect Godhead / and Genesis 2. a.
Gods Rest / was in the seventh Light. This seventh Light appeered also on the
Earth: and gave reversed;from God and out-of God; his Light and Cleernes on the
Earth. Howbeit / the Man walked not / whylst that the Cleernes of the seventh
Light shyned on the Earth.

4. Esdr. 7. d.
turned wholly into Silence. and so insencible / that they could not distinct
the Lights from the Darknesses.

11. Then pitied I the case of all Men or Generations of the Earth / for that
they were so wholly dead, insencible, Esa. 6. b. 59. a Apo. 3. b.
and blind. and saw or knew nothing at-all of all these-same.

12. After-that I saw / and behold: These seven Lights with their Shyninges
and Cleernesses / passed or went in again to God / in the heavenly Beeinge:
First-of-all / the seventh Light / which appeered last: after-that the sixth
Light / until that they all / were become consubstanciated and hid again in
God / eauen-like as at the first. And after-that it became Esa. 5. d. 9. b

dark over the universal Earth.

13. Then cried I unto God / which lives Apo. 4. 7. b.

live in thy Light? Oh / How utterly dead Esa. 59. a.
and insencible or void of conceauing of thy Love / and of ye Cleernes of thy
Lights / is now the Man become!

15. O God! Have thou then created the Man reversed;which lies now thus
wholly in the Death of Sin / and covered so utterly Esa. 9. b. 59. a 60. a.
with the Darknesses; altogether in vain?

16. Shall then all the Love / which thou reversed;eauen-heatherto; have
bestowed on him / be frustrate?

17. Are then now thy Genesis 22. b. Ier. 31. d. Joel. 2. c. Act. a. a. b.
Promises touching the Man's Salvation / wholly at-an-end / as if they were
nothing / or had not any effect in them?

18. Shal-ther nothing then reversed;I say; become of all that / whereunto thou
have reversed;out of thy gracious Love; elected the Man^ and reversed;through
thy Christ; called Math. 11. c. 22. a. Ephesians. 1. a. 1. Tess. 2. b.

AFter-that when as I had made-an-end Math. 1^. b. 1. Cor. 2. ^. Ephesians. 3. a.

inexpressible and vnwritable. For it is the whole Secreatnes of God.

4. Now when as all these Secreates of God / were thus reversed;out of ye
heavenly Being; revealed unto me: and that this great wonderful Work of
God / was so showed unto me / out of Gods mostholie Being / so feared I / and
cryed-out with loud Voice / and said: Where art thou Testimony-of-trueth?
Resolve me reversed;I pray thee; of all this which I have seen and heard
here / and is showed unto me.

5. Then appeered Testimony-of-trueth unto me / and said: Fear not. I will
not forsake thee: but thoroughly infourme thee in it all. Therefore be now

7. These Multitudes of many little Hills / which thou have seen
reversed;with so much Variaunce; so divided on the Earth / are the many.
Kingdoms of the divided Wise of this World / which are be^om so divided / out
of the last Kingdom of Babel: like as Daniel reversed;in Babylon; said unto
Nabuchodonosor the King of Babel Dan. 2. d.

divided Kingdom or the last Kingdom of Babel: and that reversed;moreover; the
God of Heaven reversed; Dan. 2. 7. ^. Esa. 9. a. Luke 1. c.

Man / that the Man should be obedient unto God / in all good Ordinance: to a
good Gal. 3. c. 4. a. Heb. 7. b.

most-holie Majesty / by or in the Man / as-well on the Earth as in Heaven.
After the which the Man has not framed himself nor endeavored him thereto.

Moreover / wher-as thou have seen / 4. Esdr. 7. ^.
turned into Silence reversed;eauen as the Dead; all these seven Days: That is
it / which the Angel in times-passed (and is now in thissame Day fulfilled)
has said unto Esdras / as a thing for to comtopasse: 4. Esd. 7. ^.
The World (says he) shall be turned into the old Silence / seven Days:
like-as in the first Judgment.

2. Behold / These seven Days / are now declared / and passed-thorough over
the World: and y^ World has been turned in those-same / into the old
Silence. and not understood nor known anye-thinge thereof: eauen like-as it
came-to-passe in the first Judgment / Genesis 6. 7.

Works reversed;what Gods purpose was therein; before that the Deluge or
Floudde came over the same.

all out from-of ye Earth / and condemn them in the Hell, euerlastinglye.

5. Moreover / in that the Heart and the very-inmost Mind of the Godhead /
unlocked or opened-abrode itself: and that thou saw / that it was so full
of Grace / Powers of God / Apo. 21. a.
and so full of all godly Goods and Bewtifulnes: Thatsame is the Mostholie of
the true Tabernacle of God / and the Most-secreatest of his godly Wysdom.
which also no Man / Esa. 64. c. Romans 8. a. 1. Cor. 2. a.
with any Mind of the sinful Fleash can comprehend^ nor see or perceive with
any Eyes of earthly Understanding. For the 2. Cor. 3. a b. 4. a.

reversed;which is a Fore-skinne before the Hearts of the uncircumcised and
unregenerated Men; covers his inward Sight / and estraungeth him / from the
Mostholie of the uncovered heavenly Cleernes of God.

6. ANd in that God reversed;out of the same Fulness Psalm. 11^. c.
a New Day / which is so abundant in Cleernes / and so full of eternal Joy:
Thatsame is the Esa. 43. b. 2. Cor. 5. b. Gal. 6. b. Apo. 21. a.
New Life / which God reversed;to an everlasting Life of all repentant Men;
bringeth-fourth out of the inmost Heart of his Mind. and is also the New
Jerusalem, / which now in the last Time descends from Heaven / and wherein the
right Perfection is to be inherited. Which Light / is the Eight Day / wher-out
the Service of the Love reversed;through the holy Spirit of Love; has his
Ministration. Through whose Appeeringe over the Earth / all the Dead
reversed;which are disceassed in the Lord 1. Cor. 15. c. 1. Tess. 4. b. Apo.

Jesus Christ; do rise-vpp from the Death / and are Esa. 26. c. Dan. 12. b. ^.
Esd. 7. d. John. 5. c. Apo. 20. b.

7. Behold / this Eight Day / is the New Day / Psalm. 118. John. 6. f.
which the Lord himself reuealeth: in which all the Righteous and Holyones of
God / do rejoice them. Wher-of also there is written in the Book of the Psalms.
Yea / it is the New Day of the Lord / which will now eauen at the very-last /
enlardge itself reversed;with all Fulness of Life / Grace / and Love; over the
universal World / Ephesians. 1. b.

People that love the Righteousness. After the which Day / Apo. 10. a.
there is not also any Day of Salvation more for to com / seeing that the same
verelie / is the Perfection^ and the Fulfillinge of the Scriptures^ as also the
very true Righteousness itself.

John. 8. b.
walk in his Light: For / over all those that have a good regard unto the same
/ and that walk reversed;through the Service of the Love; in his Light / there
comes Romans 2. a.
great Joy / Peace / and Rest / and the everlasting Life. All which also /
shall be kept-safe from the horrible Plages / Luke 21. d.
that are cominge over the Ungodly.

9. Thus keep or retaine-well now all This in thy Heart: and take good-heede
unto 2. Cor. 6. a. Gal. 6. b.
this precious Time. For in the same there shall be showed unto Thee HN / the
last Dan. 7. c. 4. Esdr. 7. d. 8. g. Math. 2^. d. John. 12. d.
Judgment of God / which is now cominge and passing-thorough over the World:
Which also is committed unto Thee reversed;out-of Many; for to reveal. For
God has chosen Thee thereto / for to reveal reversed;out of his Secreatne^;
all this unto thee which thou see and hear: and that thou should also
testify the same among all People reversed;which love the Righteousness; on the
Earth^ and warn them all concerning the Plages of the Ungodly / Esa. 13. a.
34. a. 47. b. Luke 17. 21. d.
and from the horrible Condemnation of the reprobate or damnable Men / which 2.
Tess. 2. b.
despise the Love of God / To-thende that they might turn them repentantlie /
to the Righteousnes^ and the Dispisers have none occasion / to John. 15. c.
excuse them of their Condemnation.

10. FOr all thissame that Testimony-of-trueth Esa. 11. a. 42. a. 45. a. b. c.
will work the Righteousness on the Earth / and roote-out all Falshod. Yet
thought I in my Heart:

11. O my God! In what-sort shall Al-thinge now reversed;I pray thee; be
ordered / and thy Judgment com-to-passe? and wher-through or in what manner /
shall reversed;I beseech thee; the upright Judgment become declared to the Man /
that he might understand the same? For the Man is become reversed;in his
Memory or Understanding; wholly ignorant of thy Truth / and void of
feelinge of thy Light: and 4. Esd. 7. d.
syeth in Silence / as the Dead: and is also reversed;in all his
Searchinge-prouidence; ronne-to-an-ende / in the Knowledge of Good and Evil.
For-that-cause also / he has utterly lost the right Difference betwixt Sin
and Righteousness: In such-sort / that he with his Understanding / is com into
Esa. 28. 29. b Sap. 17. a. 1. Tess. 5. a.

3. The other Spirit was / Thaccuser, which also in times-passed was a Judge /
in the Man's Understanding: and for-that-cause / he dwelt in the Man's Sap. 17.
b. Romans 2. b.
Conscience. Wherthrough the Man reversed;when as the Accuser approved his
cause; Luke 18. a.
waxedprowde reversed;in his own Righteousness; very-often: Again of
thother-syde reversed;when as y^ Accuser accused him in his Conscience / or
disalowed his cause; he became oftentimes Sap. 17. b.
greatly burdened reversed;in the Conscience; with grievous Straightnes or
Distress: and so humbled himself to all that / which was judged of him
reversed;out of the Knowledge; to be right.

4. Moreover / As I was thus harkening Searching-prouidence spoke / and said
unto the Accuser:

5. I have dealt or conuersated me for a longe-time / with the Man reversed;in
his Understanding; in the earthly Beeinge: also governed him with almaner of
Prudence and Ingeniousnes of y^ Knowledge: Genesis 3. a.
and thereto reversed;out of the same Knowledge; taught him how to distinct or
sever the Good from the Evil: and have yet farther / let him enjoy or inherit
the same experymented Wisdom / as a Light. And there was never yeat any
Unrighteousness found in me. For I am just in all my Dealinges. For-that-cause
also / my Authoritie-in-gouernment ought to be greater / then over the Man's
Understanding / in the earthly Beeinge.

6. Heer-vnto answered the Accuser. and said: I have also no-dowt / ben
always as a Judge by thee: and Sap. 17. b. Romans 2. b.
accused the Man / in his Understanding reversed;when as he transgressed in
any of all that which he admitted as Good reversed;through Thee; in y^
Knowledge; as a Transgressour of the Good. and asscribed euenso the Right therein
unto thee. Wher-through thy Power and Government reversed;in the Man's
Understanding; is become so great on the Earth.

Searchinge-prouidence: I hold not myself contented / with thissame Government
on the Earth. For there belongs yet greater unto me / inasmuch as I have
prevailed by the Man reversed;in his Understanding; with the Knowledge
reversed;against Gods Word / and the Obedience that God requires therewith;
and gotten as also kept the Genesis 3. b.
Victory therein in him / on the Earth.

8. Inasmuch then as God has always inueyed or set-vp himself against me /
on the Earth. and yet has not ben able reversed;hitherto; to prevail against
my Wisdom out of the Knowledge / So have I now therefore made-vpp myself / out
of the earthly Beeinge / for to appear reversed;with my Wisdom; against God,
wher-by that I might also get the Dominion / in the heavenly Beeinge. What
will you lay? Esa. 14. a. b.
I shall reign above God reversed;or at leastwise / equal with God; in the
Heaven also.

Accuser: Thou have reversed;surely; right thereto. For what has God
brought-in at any-time / against thine expert Wisdom / that has perseuered on
the Earth? Or 2. Pet. 3. a.
where appears that which he has promised? For Al-thinge remains still in
one State. Therefore go-fourth now boldly. Thy Title is right. And I also will
not fail / in Accusation against God / to be always by thee. For to thee
belongs the Dominion in the Heaven / like as thou reversed;through the Light
of thy Knowledge; have the same on the Earth.

10. Then said Searching-prouidence: For to win the Right / thereto am I
sufficiently grounded / and also of good courraige. Therefore I will now not
spare to press on-fourth to the ^eauen / and try my Title Esa. 58. a.
in the Law / against God. I foresee the mattier so reversed;through the
Sear^^inge in the Knowledge; that I shall prevail / and that I reversed;with
my knowledgfull Wisdom; shall (...) judged worthier for to reign / then God /
1. Reg. 15. b. 1. Pet. 1. b.
with ^he Requiring of his Obedience. For dowtles there (...) nothing / that can
bringe-vnder or-yet surmount ^he Light of the prudent and expert Wisdom.
For-^hat-cause also / it is become reversed;above the Obedience ^f God; the
Renowmedst and Excellentest / or the Best-esteemed / on the Earth.

^1. Thereto affirmed the Accuser: Thy Case is 1. Cor. 1. b.
by all worldly Wise and Scripture-learned; over the whole World / above the
Obedience which God requy^^th^ healde for the Best and Truest^ and counted ^o
be the Excellentest: and that moreover / by that ^ccasion / the scientiall or
knowledgfull Wisdom ^ath gotten the Pre-eminence / among all those that dwell
on the Earth. For the 1. Reg. 15. c. 1. Pet. 1. b.
Obedience to ^he Word of God reversed;which God requires; is ^ith the same
(like as it appears on the Earth) ^hollie gon-vnder or depressed: In
such-sort / that ^her is no more regard taken reversed;or very-little; on the
Requiring of the Obedience to ye Word of God.

^2. Then said Searchinge-prouidence: I ^^n sure that God reversed;for-asmuch
certes as He is not subtle in the Ingenious-prudentie / nether yet also any
of all His / that serve Him; shall not b^ able to excuse him heerin against
me. And when-a^ I shall then reversed;in the Law; excel Him with the
Sub^tiltie of my Knowledge / Esa. 14. a. b.
so may I also well reversed;with right and honesty / before all the World
and he^ Wise; take-in ye Heaven: and so then bear the Domi^nion / over all
what is in Heaven and on the Earth*

The XVII. Chap.


2. Now when they had thus held their Counsel^ together and
throughlie-concluded all their Mattier / in what order they would handle
the same / the^ came they reversed;with a Vehement-russhinge; unto Heaven /
before God: And Searchinge-prouidenc^ made his Complaint / before God. and
said:

3. There is great Injury ministered unto Me^ Searching-prouidence / on the
Earth: For against mine Office and my Righteousness / there is a^ other entered
into mine Office: by whom both (...) and also the Man reversed;in his
Understanding; have be^^ constrained reversed;oftentimes; Math. 12. c. Luke 11.
c.
to suffer Distourbaunce*

God. and said: Be quie^ thou Searching-prouidence: Whosoever mini^^reth
Injury / against thee and the Truth / let him (...) thy Servant: and bear
thou over him thine ^uthoritie.

^. Ther-withall spoke the Accuser. and said: Thou God thyself / art even He
which have mini^^red the wrong / unto Searching-prouidence: and have
oftentimes reversed;with thy Word; entred-in against him / into his Office.
But-yet Genesis 3. ^. Romans 1. c.
Searching-prouidence reversed;having engendered ye greatest Know^edge / in the
Man's Understanding; has always reversed;with his subtle expert Wisdom / and
with ^he Man's Ingeniousnes; gon-beyonde Thee. and ^reuayled against Thee and
the Obedience which ^hou requyrest / or has won the Victory therein ^n the
Earth / and also kept the same.

^. Inasmuch now therefore as that Searching-prouidence / has always on the
Earth reversed;with the ^xpert or knowledgfull Wisdom / in the Man's
Understanding; gon-beyonde Thee reversed;O God; in ^hy Word and Requiring of
the Obedience: and that Thou have not atchiued or brought-to-effect ^herwith /
anything on the Earth / against the expert Wisdom and the Man's Ingeniousnes /
through Searching-prouidence, A Sentence pronounced rashly in Partialitye, is
often found false.
So have thou (I say) ministered wrong against him. And for-that-cause
reversed;according to thy Word; thou shall be his Servant: and he shall also
reign or bear Dominion in the Heaven / life-as on the Earth.

7. THen said God unto Searching-prouidence: Accuser / do make a Complaint
against Me / and the Accuser taketh-part with thee / so cannot therfo^^ the
Accuser judge our Causes / according to (...) Truth. For-that-cause / choose
thou a Judge (...) Heaven wheare-in I dwell: And I will reversed;of (...)
other-side; choose also One / on the Earth / from whence thou with the Accuser
art com / and whea^^ thou have the Government. Both These shall the^^ be our
Judges / in discising of all Mattiers / whi^^ either thou / or anyman else
brings against Me^ wherein I should have done either maintaine^ wrong.

8. Thissame which God spoke / pleased Searchinge-prouidence very-well: and he
chose (...) Heaven for a Judge / Testimony-of-trueth.

9. Then chose also God reversed;of his part; on the Earth to a Judge / The
Memory or Understanding of the Man. And euenso both these
[Testimony-of-trueth and The Man's Vnder^standinge] were foreseen and chosen /
in Heaven and on Earth / for true Judges / For to pronounce-fourth reversed;now
in the last Time; the right Sentences of the true Judgment of God: and also
wha^ the Requiring of the same Judgment is of ye Children of Men / on the Earth.

Testimony-of-trueth, and said: Forasmuch now as I am foreseen and chosen of
Providence reversed;which i^ com-vpp from the Earth / unto Heaven / with
Occasion of Contention against God; to a Judge: and that also of the other-side
/ The Man's Understanding / is foreseen and chosen of God / to a Judge
likewise / So will We therefore / John. 7. ^. b.
according to the Truth reversed;now in the last time; judge vprightlie
together.

11. For presently reversed;in this Day; we will bring-fourth and pronounce
the upright Judgment, according to the Truth: Also execute the same / both in
Heaven and on Earth / to-thende that it all might go in his right Course / or
be reduced into his right Order.

12. Therefore I will now appear on the Earth, by the Man's Understanding. For
I know that the Power / Hope / and Comfort of the same on the Earth / is
utterly away.

The XVIII. Chap.
NOw when as Testymonye-of-trueth / Apo. 3. c.
by the Man's Understanding [namelie / by the same / which was wholly com
to-an-ende in the Knowledge / and had a Lust to be obedient unto the Will and
Requiringe of the Lorde] and said unto her: Open unto me the Door of thy
Mind / and receive Me. For I bring unto thee a joyful Messaige.

2. Then said the Understanding: How is it possible that I should let thee in
and receive thee into me / inasmuch as I know Thee not? And what Messaige to
Ioyfulnes / can thou also bring unto Me / wheare-as I am reversed;certes;
Esa. 59. b.
in the Death^ and in euery-behalf reversed;with the whole World; 4. Esd. 7. d.
in Silence / touching the Knowledge of the Truth: also utterly made-emptie
of Searching-prouidence / through whom reversed;in times-passed; I obtained
great Riches of the Knowledge / of the Good and of the Evil: in such-sort /
that I am now by that occasion become so wholly Psalm. 88. a.
poor of all the same / that I scarcely know any Difference more / betwixt
the Righteousness and the Sin. For all this is cleene departed from me: and I
lie here forsaken / 4. Esd. 7. d.
in the deadly Silence.

3. Then said Testimony-of-trueth: Thy Destitution in deadly Silence / and
that thou art now become thus Math. 5. a.
poor of Spirit / shall extend unto thee / to a Life eternal / and to great
Riches of God. For even to that effect is my cominge hither unto thee / for to
comfort thee / with some better-thing then that which thou have had alredie.

Understanding: Who art thou then? And from whence come thou / that thou
should be able so for to comfort me / with some better-thing then that
which I have had alredie?

5. Then said Testimony-of-trueth: I am Testimony-of-trueth, which am com unto
thee / out of Heaven / and do also speak unto thee from Heaven. Which
heavenly Truth / thou have never reversed;through all thy Riches of the
Knowledge; once seen 1. Cor. 2. b.
nor known. But now in the End of the World reversed;eauen in the upright
Judgment; it shall all / what is Truth and the Secreatnes of the heavenly
Kingdom of God / Dan. 10. e. 4. Esd. 10. f.
be geeuen thee for to see-into / and be made-knowen unto thee.

6. Also thou art now chosen of God / for to pronou^ce-fourth with Me [that is
/ with the Trueth] the sincere and upright Judgment. For thou with me / and I
with thee / are required by God and Providence / to be Judges / for to execute
Judgment / with Esa. 11. 42. a. Ier. 23. a. 33. b
Right and Equity.

7. Then said the Understanding: Oh! whereby reversed;I pray thee; may I know
/ that thou art com out of Heaven / and art Testimony-of-trueth? For there is no
Power of the Life / nor-yet sure Knowledge by me reversed;whereon I may set my
confidence; for to make-triall of thy Spirit / 1. John. 4. a.
and to prove / whether thou art of God or no / and come to me with the
heavenly Truth.

8. Then said Testimony-of-trueth: I have Luke 24. c. d. John. 16. c.
manifestly or nakedlie reversed;like-as I now speak with thee; of the
Kingdom of God and of ye Secreatnes of the same [with thissame Talk,
Testimony-of-trueth uncovered or declared to the Man's Understanding / many
Secreat-mysteries of the Kingdom of God and of his upright Righteousnes] which
truly the Spirits that are not of God / John. 14. b.
cannot do. For all foreign Spirits reversed;which are not of God nor of the
Truth; have not any Cleernes nor upright Beeinge of the Kingdom of God / nor
of his upright Righteousness / like-as thou hear well / that there is by Me.
But through the Searchinge in the Knowledge / 1. Tim. 4. 2. Tim. 3. 2. Pet. 2.
a.
they seduce the Man's Understanding.

9. Howbeit / in that thou art become thus poor of Spirit / be not sorrowful
therein: but rejoice thee. For reversed;therefore; Math. 5. a.
the Kingdom of the God of Heavens / belongs unto Thee.

10. Seek not also again / to have any confidence in the Knowledge / for to
search or try reversed;ther-through; ye Spirits / and to prove or to 1.
John. 4. a.
know, whether they be of God or no. For ther-with thou should most-of-all
become deceived.

1. Cor. 1. 2. b
judge them / through any Riches of the Knowledge / nor thorough any
Scripture-learnednes / whether they be of God. but only / John. 8. c.
through the heavenly Truth / and the sincere Being of the same.

12. For-that-cause / hear now and believe Me: and geeue-ouer all thine
Understanding in Me / so shall thou then find al-thinge reversed;in the
Truth; euen-like as I have said unto thee: Yet not in the Knowledge /
according to the manner of the ingenious Prudentie. but in the true Being of
the living Godhead / wherewith I Testimony-of-trueth am conformablie-vnyted.

13. NOw when as the Understanding heard and understood / that all that which
was chanced unto her / was told her according to the Truth. and that also
the Math. 13. b. Luke 24. f.
Openinge of the Kingdom of the God of Heavens and of his upright Righteousness
/ came-to-passe accordingly / then opened the whole Mind of the
Understanding itself / and received Testimony-of-trueth very lovely / with
Joy: and believed Him with whole Heart. And submittinge herself obedientlie
under his Requiringe / she said:

14. Blessed Psalm. 118. c. Math. 21. a.
art thou to the Lord reversed;O Testimony-of-trueth; Act. 4. d. 5. a.
thatsame do I also lay-downe all here before thy Feet: For thou art my Lord
/ and my right Head.

15. Therefore reversed;O my Lord; do with me and with all what is by me /
Luke 1. d.
according to thine and thy Lords Will. For Psalm. 119.
I desire to live and walk perfectly / according to thy Word and Counsel
of Wisdom. For thereunto have I Psalm. 40. ^.
a Lust / eauen from my whole Heart.

16. Then did Testimony-of-trueth / take-vpp the Man's Understanding. He took
the same unto him / as his Deerlie-beloued: and embraced her euenso in his
Arms. and in such-like-sort did also the Man's Understanding / unto
Testimony-of-trueth. And being euenso reversed;in all Obedience of the
Requiringe of the Love; become concordable and of-one-beeinge with each-other /
they Psalm. 14. a. 16. b. Apo. 4. b.
lauded and thanked the God of Heaven / which lives from everlasting to
everlasting.

The XIX. Chap.
Man's Understanding had wholly geeuen-ouer herself to Testimony-of-trueth^ and
humbly submitted her to his Obedience: and walked also faithfullye in the same
Obedience: and that they thereto in mutual-sort / honored and thanked the God
of Life / Then saw I. and behold: The whole Being of the Godhead / opened
again his whole Heart and Mind reversed;which is full of Grace / Love /
Powers / and Life; in all respects / Apo. 21. a.
with almaner Garnishing of Excellent-bewtie / eauen as I had seen the same
before. And God showed himself over the Earth / and brought-fourth out of his
Heart and Mind / the New Life / Esa. 60. c. Apo. 21. 22. a.
the Light of Perfection: and it is the Eight-daye / Psalm. 118. c. John. 6. f.
which the Lord has made^ and declared on the Earth / to the Making-aliue of
Men in his upright Beeinge / and wherein men rejoice them with Gladness.

2. After that I saw. and behold: Thissame Eight-daye appeered on the Earth /
and gave from God and out-of God / his Light and Cleernes on the Earth. and the
Understanding reversed; Ephesians. 4. ^. 5. ^.
which walked faithfully / in all Love / and in all Obedience toward
Testimonye-of-trueth; became reversed;through the same Light of the New or Eight
Day; borne-anew out of the Death / or out of the Mortalitie^ 1. Cor. 15. f.
and changed into the everlasting Immortality: and became euenso John. 3. a.
6. f Romans 5. 6. 8.
made-aliue reversed;with perfect Joy of the holy Spirit of Love; in the New
Life / and sanctified unto the Lord.

3. THen did Understanding rejoice her Esa. 25. a. Math. 27. 2. Cor. 3. 4. a.
Ephesians. 2. b.
or the Coueringe of the sinful Fleash / was so thoroughly laide-away from her
Heart^ the Veil departed from the Most-holie: and that she reversed;in all
Love of the holy Spirit; was so sanctified to the God of Heaven: and sawe-into
the mostholie Beeinge of God / Apo. 21. a.
and all the Sumpteous-garnishing of the Riches of his spiritual and heavenly
Goods / so nakedlie and cleerlie / as also inherited all the same / in God / in
Christ, and in ye Holie-gost of Love / with Testimony-of-trueth.

4. And euenso heer-with / became the sanctified Understanding so bright in
Cleernes / eauen as was Testimony-of-trueth, and as all Heavens of the living
Deity. Through which Cleernes / the sanctified Understanding beheld
Testimony-of-trueth, and all the Heavens with the perfect Deity / 1. Cor. 13.
b. 2. Cor. ^. b.
from Face to Face / and became of-one-beeinge with those-same.

5. TH^n said Testimony-of-trueth to the Man's sanctified Understanding:
Behold / Now understand thou reversed;through y^ Light of the New Life;
that Gods Light and Wisdom / and his heavenly Riches reversed;which are com
unto thee out of his living Beeinge; Pro. 8. b. Sap. 7. a.
does far excel the Light and Wisdom that proceeds out of the Riches of
the Knowledge. and that thou before reversed;thewhylst thou soughtest the
Wisdom / in the Knowledge / and in the ingenious Prudentie; inheritedst not
els-what but great Esa. 59. a. Math. 11. c.

Wisdom of God; Esa. 57 b. Sap. 3. 5. a. Heb. 4. a. Apo. 21. a.

6. Wherefore / O thou holy Understanding thou Blessed of the Lord / in that
thou reversed;before this thy New Birth; have believed Me Testimony-of-trueth
^whollie geeuen-ouer thyself reversed;obedientlie; unto my Doctrine or
Requiringe^ and ben obedient and faithful / in the Passe-ouer of the
Sufferinge and Death of Christ reversed;eauen into the second John. 3. a. b.

toward thee.

7. Also thou sh^lt ascend with me unto Heaven / and hear, behold, and
inherit with Joy / all what is in Heaven. Also we both are (like as I said
before unto thee) foreseen and chosen to upright Judges / for to
pronounce-fourth Gods righteous Judgment reversed;in this his John. 6. 8. d
Eight-daye; both in Heaven and also on Earth: and euenso with Righteousness
reversed;under the Obedience of the Love; to govern Esa. 11. 42. a. Ier. 23.
a. 33. b Sap. 3. a. Math. 19. a. Act. 17. d. Iudae. 1. b.
the universal Earth reversed;with God and his Saints; in vpright-maner /
To-thende that it all reversed;both in Heaven and on Earth; may go in his right
Course / or be set in his right Ordinance.

8. Heer-withall did the holy Understanding / Testimony-of-trueth. and said:
Deuteronomy. 32. a. Tob. 13. a. Eccli. 35. d. Apo. 15. a.
All the Works of the Lord are upright and good: and his Law and Judgment
is only true. Let him deal with me / Luke 1. d.
according to his Will.

9. After-that I saw. and behold: The Man's sanctified Understanding, Memory /
or Thoughts / with Testimony-of-trueth / assembled them to the Multitudes of
the Heavens of God and Christ / in the heavenly Beeinge: Luke 15. d.
Wherein all the heavenly Society reversed;with much Joy; did greatly
rejoice them. And there was made over all Heavens and in all Heavens / a great
Triumph and Gladness.

10. After-that I saw. and behold: Thissame holy Understanding, with
Testimonye-of-trueth / were set reversed;of God and Providence; Esa. 16. b.
Math. 19. d.
on the Iudgment-seates. and allowed and esteemed to be worthy / for to judge
it all both in Heaven and on Earth reversed;through Gods Judgment with his
Holyones; Act. 17. d.
with Right and Equity.

The XX. Chap.
AFter-that spoke Testymonye-of-trueth, holy Understanding: Behold /
Presently reversed;eauen in thissame New Day of the Psalm. 118. c. John. 6. f.
8. d Apo. 21. a.
new and true Life; we are foreseen to true Judges together-with God and all
his Holyones / and also set thereto reversed;by God and Providence; on the
Iudgment-seates / To-thende that all Mattiers reversed;both of that which is in
Heaven / and of that which is on Earth; should com and be presented before us /
that we might hear and examen those-same / also judge them according to the
Truth / and so pronounce-fourth the right Sentences ther-of.

2. After-that / Testimony-of-trueth and holy Understanding spoke both-alike
together / with a Thankes-geeuinge unto God. and said:

Act. 17. d.

right reversed;or is to be justified; right shall be geeuen him / and he shall
be judged vprightlie.

4. Therefore let eueryone now appear reversed;in thissame Day; with his Cause
/ Romans 14. b. 2. Cor. 5. b.
before the Iudgment-seate of Christ. And we will bringe-fourth the upright
Judgment reversed;according to the Truth of God and Christ, and according to
the Understanding of the holy Spirit; / and pronounce-fourth the Sentence
justly.

Searching-prouidence in place. and said: O thou Testimonye of the eternal
Truth, and thou Understanding of the holy Wisdom reversed;ye noble Lords
and Princes / in Heaven and on Earth; Apo. 5. b.
Ye are worthy to sit on the Seats of Judgment / for to judge all Mattiers
vprightlie. For surely all things Heb. 4. c.
are nakedlie known reversed;according to the Truth; unto your Noblenes.

6. Inasmuch now then as that your Noblenes can right-easelie and with small
labor / know and understand the Deepnes of all Understandings
reversed;which also dowtles must now all appear before thissame Judgment;^ and
judge eueryone reversed;according to the Truth; vprightlie / So do I therefore
humble myself so much the free-willinger before your noble Wisdom: and will also

7. For-that-cause vouchsafe now to hear me in this reversed;O ye noble and

The XXI. Chap.
AFter-that spoke God. and said: Genesis 22. b. Romans 9. a. Heb. 2. b.
of the renowmedst kingly Stock of the most-puissant Majesty: Presently
reversed;eauen in thissame Day of the upright Judgment; will I excuse or
clear myself with the Truth reversed;before your Noblenes of so excellent and
high-degree; against my contrary Party: and affirm here before the Judgment
/ Exo. 20. a. Esa. 41. 42. 44. 48.
that there can none other God more beare-dominion / besides Me. For I only am
the Lord.

2. Inasmuch then as that I am Deu. 32. a. Tob. 13. a. Apo. 15. a.
holy, upright, and true / in all my Works / so will I also Esa. 32. a. Ier.
23. a. 33. b.
possess alone the Seat of the godly Maiestie^ and also reversed;according
to the Truth; keep well the Victory / and that with Right.

3. I Hear here before the Judgment / a by the Man / in his Understanding:
Whereto I rightly make-answer / that I know not of any other Light / John. 1.
a.
but my Life: and the Life / which proceeds or flows from Me / thatsame is
the true Light of the Man: and is to an Illuminating of him in his
Understanding / and there is none other Light more.

4. Also I know not of any other Sap. 7. c.
Wisdom / but the holy Understanding / which also is a Life of my Life^ and
for that cause likewise / a Light of my Light. I know not also of any Peace /
but the peaceable 1. John. 1. a. 3. b. 4. b.
Louelynes of my Spirit of the Love / which also all my Holyones reversed;which
are become sanctified through the Light of my Life; do inherit in the
everlasting Life.

5. For-that-cause / O ye honorable Lords Testimony-of-trueth and holy
Understanding have well in remembrance / this my Clearing of myself: and
consider effectually of my Light. And then peruse it all / whether that there
be in Heaven or-yet upon Earth / any other Light more / then Esa. 60. c. John.
1. 8. b. 1. John. 1. a.
that Light / which is my true Life itself: and whether that also it does not
all walk in ye John. 8. b.
Darknesses / that is or has his Fourth-goinge without my Light of Life. In
such-like-sort deal also with my Wisdom / Rest / and Peace / wherein the
sincere Love standeth-firme for evermore. For I know that your Noblenesses do
well understand and have intelligence of these Mattiers.

Searching-prouidence, and ye Clearing of God in his case / being thus
com-to-passe / so did then the Lords and Judges / take-vp both their Causes:
and departed ther-with into their Counsel-chamber / for to peruse-ouer the same
groundlye / and that they might so pronounce-fourth an upright Sentence
ther-of.

7. Now whenas they were com-fourth again / they said unto God and
Providence: Ye have presented your Causes on both sides / here before us and
the Judgment: and having thoroughly considered thereof / so is this our
Counsel touching the same / and our first Sentence / that we pronounce ther-of.

8. Each-one of you shall express or declare here before Us / The first
Sentence.
the cleerest Certification reversed;that is known unto him thereof; of his
Right / whereby he might have Justice.

9. Out of which Declaration / we will yet farther throughlie-wey each-ones
Mattier / To-thend that we pronounce not fourth the last Sentence
ouer-swiftlie / and so the one or the other to rest discontented: but that it
may be wrought with such Manifest-certification and Understanding / that it
may be as-well known to him against whom the same falleth-out / that we have
spoken rightly / or pronounced the Sentence in right-fourme / according the to
Truth / as unto him with whom the mattier goes.

10. NOw when these Words were ended / Testimony-of-trueth said: Let
Searching-prouidence bring-fourth here before us / his Declaration of his
Light / and of his Equality with the Godhead: And let God also do the like /
of his Light. and that there is none other Light more / and that He only / is
God and the Lord. Eueryone shall now reversed;in thissame Psalm. 118. c. John.
6. f. 8. d
New Day; hear the upright Judgment pronounced-fourth / through Us
Testimony-of-trueth, and Holie-vnderstandinge.

11. Heer-vnto Searchinge-prouidence said: Forasmuch as God has now cleared
himself / that He knows not of any other Light more: as also that there
should not be any other Wisdom more / but only his Light and Wisdom / So is
therefore my Request to your Noblenes reversed;ye honorable Lords; that God
may have the Foregoing / in his Declaration: and euenso will I then
reversed;in the Vtteraunce of his mattier; take-heede unto ye time of my
Declaration. and speake-fourth the same (like-as it shall also be found
right-true) according to the Truth.

God, it is vouchsafed Thee / that thou should first bringe-fourth the
Declaration of thy Right before us. So let us now hear thy Declaration / to
prove that thou have right in thy Cause. And Thou reversed;O
Searching-prouidence; shall turn thy Hearing thereunto. Wher-in then God has
right / that shall thou acknowledge to be true.

13. If thou then be able to disaprooue the same reversed;by alleging of any
better and cleerer Certificatio^; in any-poynt / therein shall thou then be
heard also at-full. And in such Order shall thou likewise let us hear thy
Declaration / that thou have to approve thy mattier right / So may we then
understand both your Cases^ and ye both likewise / our Sentence reversed;that
we pronounce the same vprightlie / according to the Truth; in right-sort /
To-thende that ye reversed;on both sides; may euenso approve and acknowledge
all what is right / for right^ and also accomplish the same.

The XXII. Chap.
AFter that / God spoke. and said: I

2. Behold: I God / Exodus 3. b.
am only God. Mich. 5. a. Esa. 41. a. 4^. b. 44. b.
I was
from in Eternity / without beginning. I am continually present / Apo. 4. ^.
also always to-com or appeeringe: and shall remain without end reversed;in
my heavenly Mansion and Glorious-dignitie; everlastingly. Suchlike is also
my Beeinge / which is an eternal Life with me.

3. Thissame Life of mine / John. 1. ^.
is the true Light. Thissame Light of mine / is my true Word my only begotten
Son which floweth-fourth from Me / to the Peace and Salvation of Men. Which
Word of mine / was also begotten of Me eauen from the Beginning / Genesis 1.
a. Psalm. 33. a. John. 1. a.
when as I made through the same / Heaven and Earth / with all their Ornaments.
Whosoever is in the same Word / and the Word in him / he has my true
Light: and inheriteth reversed;in the same Light; Math. 11. c. Heb. 4. a.
my Rest and Peace / and my everlasting Life.

God myself reversed; Exodus 20. a. Deuteronomy. 32. d. Esa. 44. 45. b
which am only the Lord; have also out of Myself reversed;as out of an
unchangeable Light; brought-fourth Days or Lights / to several Services or
Offices / on the Earth / and caused thosesame / Genesis 1. a. b.
out of y^ Eaueninges and Morninges / for to be or to appear / on the Earth:
also reversed;in my Light; I foresawe it-all / what there was needful in
euery-behalf: and made all the same myself / to a good Ordinance.

5. Also I foresawe the Man / to make him to mine Imaige: and euenso
reversed;to an Imaige of God; made Genesis 1. c. 2. a
I the Man / To-thend that the same / thorough the Light of my Wisdom or
Understanding ( Genesis 2. c.
which I have begotten and brought unto the Man reversed;out of his Life of my
Life; to an Healp for him) should govern all that which was brought-fourth or
created through my Word / well and vprightlie^ Genesis 1. c. 9. a
and euenso in my Beeinge / have the Dominion / over the created Things on the
Earth.

6. Behold: All this was Genesis 1. a. Psalm. 33. a. Pro. 8. c. John. 1. a.
made and ordained in such-sort / through my Light / Word / and Wisdom. Who
is-ther then that may be a God / besides Esa. 43. 44. 48. b.
I myself? Or where is-ther an other God / that can be like Me / in my Light
and Wisdom / and in my Works?

7. Therefore I affirm here now for Right / that I am only God. and that also
it-all whatsoever is in Heaven and on Earth / ought to submit itself and be
obedient unto Me / in my Word. For Exodus 19. a. Psalm. 24. a.
it is all / my Proprietee or Very-owne.

8. AFter-that / Searching-prouide^ce spoke. God has made all Things
reversed;which He has made; Psalm. 33. a.
through his Word: but-yet not without Me. For I myself have been assuredly
(life as God himself has also here affirmed) in all his Works / the
Providence of the same: Pro. 8. c.
and have foreseen it all unto God / ereuer that he made the same / To-thend
that He should make it all euenso / out of my Wisdom.

9. For I myself / was Gods Eye / or the provident Cleernes of his Light: Genesis
1. 2. Pro. 8. c.
Wher-through He sawe-into the upright Form of all Things / ereuer that he
made the same. And yet farther / to a more Certentie or Confirmation of my Right.

10. I myself have also first foreseen the Man unto God / euen-like as He
made the same: In like sort also / the Healp of the Man: insomuch / that God
Genesis 1. 2. a.
made it-all / euen-like as I Providence foresawe it-all unto Him. For God
could do nothing without Me / because I was ye Sightthe Highest and Pretioust
of the Body of God. For-that-cause I am also the Lord / or a God, euen-like
as God himself.

The XXIII. Chap.
God. It is true: Providence is the Eye or the Sight / and a precious Member of
my Body: and that I also reversed;through the same; have seene-into Al-thinge
reversed;ereuer I made it; well and a-right: In Genesis 1. 2. ^.
like-sort also touching the Man / which I made reversed;with Light / Truth /
and Providence; according to my Beeinge reversed;in all; like unto Myself /
to-thend that the Man should live in Me / and I in him reversed;with one
Beeinge; for evermore.

2. Had now the Man with the Providence / remained standinge in my Word /
Light / or Beeinge: and not searched / for to know anythinge more / So should
also then likewise my Light and Truth / have remained still in the Man and in
his Providence. Also the Man should not have needed any thing more / for to
searchreversed;curiously; after my Light or Truth / in the Knowledge. For the
Life Genesis 2. b.
and also the Dyinge of the Death / was set in sight / before the Man and his
Providence: in such-sort / that there was not anything wanting to the Man / for
to have lived in my Goodness of the true Light eternally.

3. But now / when as the Man with the Providence / were fallen-awaye from my
upright Being / and the Light of my Life / Genesis 3. a.
and had taken-on to them the Searching in the Knowledge of the Good and of the
Evil: and that it went so evil with the Man reversed;by that occasion;
continually / So have I Ier. 25. a. 29. b. 35. b.
sought upon him reversed;with my Word; oftentimes / to procure him to the
Obedience of my Requiringe: and have euenso infourmed him / with my Light /
To-thend that I might Esa. 55. a. Math. 11. c.
rid him from his Miserie^ and bring him again unto Me / in the Light of
my Life.

4. Howbeit / the Man / seekinge always his 1. Cor. 1. 2. b.
could not so know nor understand my Light nor Wisdom / nether-yet the
Obedience / which I required of him through my Word. And is also by that
occasion reversed;eauen until thissame Day of the righteous Judgment;
remaining in his Misery: nether coulde-ther also anyman else / deliver him
therfrom.

5. Therefore I affirm / that there is none other Light / John. 1. a.
but my Life: nor-yet any other Wisdom / but the Word of my Truth: Psalm. 33.
a. Pro. 8. c. John. 1. a.
Wher-through I have wrought all my Works.

6. It is true: That which I have made / I have reversed;out of the Providence
which was of-one-beeing with my Godhead; Genesis 2. a.
made it-all well: but not through Searchinge-prouidence, as to search
ther-after in the Knowledge / how it might best
accord or ioyne-together. but as I sawe-into the upright Form thereof / in
my Beeinge. And according to the same Form / Genesis 2. a.
it was all good / what-soeuer I made.

7. So is now therefore the Conclusion of this my Declaration / to prove that I
have not brought-fourth my Light and Wisdom / nor-yet my Works / through
Searching-prouidence in ye Knowledge. but as the same stood nakedlie before Me
reversed;in my Beeinge; according to the Truth. Wherewith I express
sufficiently reversed;and have also before expressed and proved the same; that
my Cause is right. and that I only / Esa. 43. b. 44 a. 48. b.
am the Lord and God.

SEarchinge-prouidence having heald his peace heer-at a little-while / spoke
afterward. and said: God is yet for-al-that utterly ungrounded in all his
Declaration / for to keep the Right and the Authoritie-of-gouernment against
Me.

9. For / inasmuch as I am the Sight of God / and the Principalst of the whole
Body of God (which thing also God himself grants / and must needs grant
thereunto:) and that I with the Man's Understanding / have always
reversed;thorough the Searching in the Knowledge; sought the Welfare of the Man
/ on the Earth^ and brought-fourth euenso reversed;out of the same Light of the
highlie-bosted knowledgfull Wisdom; so manifold good Policies unto Peace on
the Earth / So will I now therefore reversed;O ye noble Lords; yelde-ouer my
Mattier reversed;which I have here in Cleernes / discovered unto your
Noblenes; wholly into your hands / for to Psalm. 9. a. Act. 17. d.
judge the same with Righteousness. For I have such confidence in your Noblenes /
that look whosoever has right in his cause / him will ye defend / and yield him
right in his Title.

2. To both your Concord and Peace / and to the Concord and Peace of all
those which have any Mattiers before the Judgment of God and Christ, ye shall
now reversed;on the behalf of your Mattiers; er-euer that the last Sentence be
geeuen / hear yeat one Sentence / wher-with the Most-needfullest reversed;that
ye might first do euenso / or accomplish the same; shall be spoken-fourth.

3. For that now reversed;to a good concordable Peace; there might be of you
Twain and of all what is divided reversed;which ought to be One; made One:
Ephesians. 2. b.
and that the Middel-wall / which is grown or entredin betwixt you both / and
betwixt all those which are separated from God and from the good Being of God^
and yet love ye Righteousness / might in thissame New Day of the righteous
Judgment / 2. Cor. 3. b.
become removed / So is this now reversed;in that consideration; yeat our
Sentence / which we reversed;as the necessity requires it; will
pronounce-fourth before the last Sentence.

4. Which Sentence, we reversed;as upright Judges and Peacemakers; do require
/ that ye both / and all those which are in Heaven and on Earth that love the
Righteousness / should from this present howre-fourth reversed;first or
before-all; fulfill or accomplish. And when as the same is fulfilled / so will
we then immediatlye ther-after / pronounce-fourth the last Sentence / or the
last Judgment: and also execute the same speedily / in Heaven and on Earth.

The second Sentence.
we say: That eueryone / both in Heaven and also on Earth reversed;like-as it
is meet and right; shall from this howre-fourth / whollye Luke 14. d. Act. 4.
c. 5. a. 2. Cor. 10. a.

and holy Understanding;^ set his right and wrong / in our Understanding
and Counsel of the Wysdome^ and euenso hold himself wel-contented with Us and
our Arbitrament or Sentence / for to do all that which we require /
accordinglye.

6. For whosoever do wholly 2. Cor. 10. a.
geeue-ouer themselves / in our Word and Requiring / and com unto us: and
that it were so that the Middel-wall were by them reversed;wher-through the
Division and Discord has had his proceeding or is com-fourth / Yet must
the same Middel-wall become manifest and known unto them: and Thosesame
reversed;to whom the Middel-wall is so manifested and made-knowen; shall then
also yield themselves good-willinglie / to become purged or rid from the same.
let the same be removed from them. let themselves be prepared to an acceptable
People for the Lorde^ and assembled to the Holyones of God: for to live euenso
with all the Holyones of God / concordablie reversed; Ephe. 4. 5. ^. 1. John.
3. 4. b
in all Love; for evermore.

7. AFter-that / when as thissame Sentence God and Providence, and also them
all / that were in Heaven and on Earth reversed;which loved the Righteousness;
very-well: and they all acknowledged / that it was right / and ought to be don
eauenso.

8. And heer-withall / they all reversed;which loved the Righteousness;
gaue-ouer themselves goodwillinglie / in the Word and Requiring of
Testimony-of-trueth, and of the holy Understanding. and also promised / that
they would gladly endeavor themselves / to accomplish all the same / like-as
the last Sentence should signify and require.

9 Fourth-with after that / when as thissame Geeuing-ouer was thus don / then
saw I. and behold: There appeered One unto me / which was clothed with white
Silk: and he had a great Trumpet / which he held with both his Hands. And
there stood written on his Forehead: The Peace of God.

10. Thissame sowned his Trumpet very-lowde / over Math. 24. d. 1. Cor. 15. c.
1. Tess. 4. b.
all Heavens / and over all those that inhabited therein: also over the whole
Earth / and over all those that dwelled on the Earth and in the same. And ye
Voice of his Trumpet sounded euen-thus:

Esa. 44. 49.
O ye Heavens / and all ye that dwell therein.

12. Rejoice now / thou Earth / and all ye that dwell ther-on / which love the
Righteousness.

13. Rejoice now / ye 1. Cor. 15. c. Apo. 14. b.
Dead / which lie in the Earth / and are disceassed in Christ.

14. For this-daye ye shall all Esa. 26. c. Dan. 12. b.
rise-vpp from the Death. and all what is yeat on the Earth reversed;that
loves the Righteousness; 1. Cor. 15. f. 1. Tess. 4. b.
become changed / and com to the Judgment of Righteousness.

15. Now shall the righteous John. 12. c. Apo. 14. a.
Judgment passefourth / or be brought-to-light / according to the Truth: and
the sincere Righteousness reversed;like-as it was from in Eternity / and shall
also remain perpetually; become manifestly declared.

16. Now shall likewise all whatsoever is in Heaven and on the Earth / be Esa.

People reversed;which have geeuen-ouer themselves to the Word of

The XXV. Chap.
the upright Judgment / according to the Truth / and to set the Parties
reversed;to Concordablenes; at-peace: and spoke both-alike together / first
these Words:

2. INasmuch as that God has made his Declaration / that He was from in
Eternitie^ and in the Beginning when as He made him ye Man / only the Lord
/ Genesis 1. 2. Exodus 20. Esa. 44. b.
the Life / the Light / and the true Word and Wisdom itself: and euenso
foresawe it-all / what-euer He made. And that Providence has also declared /
that he first foresawe all things reversed;according to the upright Form
thereof; unto God: and that God Genesis 1. 2. a.
made all the same accordingly / So know we very-well / that all the same is
good. and that ether-other / in the same Cause of his reversed;when as they both
were yeat of vnifourme-beeing / and stood undivided in one Beeinge; has well
reversed;for the first; good right.

3. But now / heere-betweene there is a secreat
and by all his Kingdom / and by all the Members of his Body / great Peace and
Concord. Howbeit after-that / when as God had made the Man reversed;on the
Earth; Genesis 1. d. 2. b
to an Imaige of himself reversed;as a Life / of his Life / a Light / of his
Light / and a Providence / of his Providence: and also out of him / the
Understanding / to an Healp of the same Beeinge; so became-ther a Genesis 3. b.
Ephe. 2. b.
Middel-wall betwixt God and his Imaige / like-as it in this present Day
appears before Us. Through which Middel-wall (which also may well be a
Misvnderstandinge / whereby the one cannot understand the other aright) there is
likewise entred-in euery-wheare on the Earth / so great Variaunce and
Iniquitie^ and so manifold Deceiptes and Falshod.

God has heer-vnto / bestowed always great diligence / ^er. 25. a. 29. b.
35. b. Heb. 1. a.
through his Messengers / for to pluck the Man with his Word / to the
Obedience of ye Requiring of the same Woord^ and to his upright Beeinge / whereby
he might be rid from the Iniquitie^ and live in all Love and Peace.

5. In like-maner: Providence has also bestowed always great diligence
reversed;through Searchinge in the Knowledge; with the Man's Understanding /
for to bring the Man into good Order: and for-that-cause also (to-thende that
the Man should live peaceably on the Earth^ and be delivered from the
Destruction of the Iniquity) has brought-in many requisite Policies and
Laws. Howbeit / the Man is not in all those-same reversed; Romans 3. c. Gal. 3.
b. Heb. 7. b.
even til-vnto thissame Day of the righteous Judgment of God on the Earth;
releassed from the Iniquity / nor brought unto ye Peace: nor-yet also the Genesis
3. b. Esa. 59. a. Ephesians. 2. b.
Middel-wall reversed;wherthrough all Iniquity is proceeded; made-knowen /
whereby the Man might have been brought Ephesians. 2. b.
unto Peace and Concorde^ and the true Righteousness / have gotten the Victory
on the Earth.

6. Forasmuch now then as that this Middel-wall / Esa. 59. a. Math. 11. c.
in grievous Misery / and plucked much Dissension and Iniquity on his own
neck. But now in thissame New Day (wher-through all 1. Cor. 4. a.
things must euen-now become manifested) the Fail Genesis 3. b. Esa. 59. a. Ephesians.
2. b.
and Middel-wall reversed;which is the Occasion of all Iniquity and Variaunce;
is nakedlie appeered in Sight and rightly made-knowen / unto Us
Testimony-of-trueth and holy Understanding.

The XXVI. Chap.
AFter these Words / the Lords

2. FOrasmuch now as that y^ 4. Esd. 5. a. 14. b. Math. 24. b.
Iniquitie^ / together with the subtle Falshod / and the most-wylie Hearts /
are so exceedingly multiplied euery-wheare / with the Man on the Earth / and
that the Occasion of all this Iniquity / is not known unto eueryone: and that
moreover God and Providence, and eueryone that loves the Righteousness / would
most-gladlie s^e the Salvation and Welfare of the Man / and the Peace on the
Earth: and yet nevertheless / there is great Math. 24. b.
Variaunce entred-in: and that thereto eueryone that loves the Righteousness /
has now goodwillinglie 2. Cor. 10. b.
geeuen-ouer himself / in our Word and Counsel of the Wisdom^ and set all
things in our Hands (to-thende that all this Controversy / and Genesis 3. b.
Ephe. 2. b.
the Mean wher-through the Iniquity has so multiplied itself / as also the
Iniquity herself / should be removed or utterly rooted-out^ and so al-thinge
be Genesis 1. 2.
restored again / into his upright Form) / So harken here now therefore unto
this our Saying and Requiringe. For even after-that / we will pronounce-fourth
an upright Sentence of it all.

3. For that euery-one might now reversed;in thissame Day of the righteous
Judgment of God; be preserved from the Esa. 47. b.
Perrels of great Damaige both to Soul and Body / so let not anyone
reversed;from thissame present Day fourth; Math. 7. a. Luke 6. d. Romans 2. 14.
b.
take upon him for to blame or accuse the one the-other / as touching his
Offices behalf. nether-yet also that the Iniquity and Variaunce is grown to
be on ye Earth / by anymans Fault: Nether shall also anyone reversed;the one
against the-other; esteem or geeue-fourth himself Phil. 2. a.
for great reversed;either high-of-reputation; for his knowledgfull Wisdoms
cause: nor desire in such respect / to be the Lord / or to bear the Lordship.
But that which We pronounce to an upright Judgment or Sentence / shall
eueryone do / and not omit to accomplish the same.

4. Eueryone shall from this howre-fourth The last Sentence.
wheare he and his Being was in the Beginning / er-euer God Genesis 1. a. Romans
6. a. b.
made the Man on the Earth: and assemble him euenso again / to his upright
Beeinge [namelie / into the same State / as his Beeinge was in his Peace /
er-euer God made the Man on the Earth.] And all what eueryone had then / and
all whatsoever is flowen or issued with Him / out of the same former Beeinge /
all that shall he bring-in again reversed;with himself; to the same Beeinge:
Math. 16. c. Luke 9. 14. d.
Also forsake all that which is not of the same Beeinge / or proceeds not
therfrom.

5. Behold / and have now all / a good regard to this last Sentence: for in
the Fulfillinge of the same / 2. Cor. 3. b. Ephe. 2. b.
all Middel-walles / Dissentions / and Iniquities reversed;which are grown to
be even from the Beginning / and have brought-in all Variaunce and
Disturbaunce; shall not choose but remain without the Man / and passe-awaye to
nothing / inasmuch as the same Iniquities / are not of the upright Beeinge of
God nor of the Man / nether-yet proceed ther-from.

6. When now then thissame is thus accomplished by eueryone / so shall it be
well seen-into and known by eueryone / what he is Genesis 3. b.
of himself. Also what Service or Office there belongs to him for to minister
or use: and which is also his Glory / whereunto he has right. For he shall
then inherit all the same / and live therein peaceably.

God, Heer-in shall thou first have the Fore-goinge: Settinge thy-self in the
Form of the same Beeinge / like-as thou have ben from in Eternity / and
like-as thou wast in the Beginning / er-euer thou made the Man / on the
Earth.

8. Forasmuch then as that thou art an heavenly Beeinge / John. 1. 4. c. 6. b.
10. 12. 17. Heb. 1. a.
Light / and Spirit / so shall thou pluck all that which is gon-fourth or
flowen-out from Thee to the Earth reversed;to-wit / heavenly Beeinges /
Lights / and Spirits; again unto thee. And all what comes to thee ther-of /
that-same shall thou receive / and set or ordain it in his upright Ordinance.

9. In such like-sort / shall thou also reversed;O Providence; set thyself in
the Form of the same Beeinge / like-as thou have ben from in Eternity / and
like-as thou wast in the Beginning / er-euer God made the Man / on the Earth:
And all that which was than by thee / and all what is flowen-fourth with thee /
out of the same Beeinge / that-same shall thou pluck again unto thee / into
the same Beeinge. And all what comes to thee ther-of / that shall thou receive:
and euenso shall then that-same also enter-in with thee / to his right
Ordinance.

10. LEt eueryone respect-well this upright 1. Cor. 15. ^. ^
so-well the earthly and natural Being / in His / as the heavenly and
spiritual Beeinge / in His. For this is now Dan. 7. c. 4. Esd. 7. d.
the Last Judgment / wher-vnto the Love and her Service reaches.

11. For-that-cause / O thou earthly and natural Being / thou shall also
endeavor thyself / for to set thee reversed;according to the Requiringe of
the Word of the Lord and his Service of Love; in the Form of the same
Beeinge / like-as thou wast in the Beginning / er-euer Genesis 3. b. Eccle. 12. a.
God made the Man / on the Earth: And all what-soeuer is departed from thy
Beeinge / as earthly and Nature / that shall thou pluck unto thee again. And
all what comes unto thee ther-of / that shall thou also receive / and set or
ordain each-one reversed;according to his right Beeinge and Nature; in his
right Ordinance.

12. And when as now thissame reversed;with eueryone which has a Lust for to
enter into his right Beeinge and Ordinance; is all euen-thus brought-to-passe
and accomplished. and when as also the Time Pro. 6. ^. Gal. 6. b.
of Grace reversed;for eueryone to enter-in to his upright Beeinge; is
ouer-passed or ended / Then shall all that which remayneth-ouer / without the
upright Beeinge [namelie / of that which is Spiritual and Naturall]: and
whatsoever is not profitable or necessary for anythinge in Heaven nor on Earth
/ be utterly rooted-out / and 1. Cor. 3. b. 2. Pet. 3. a. Apo. 14. b. 16 17.
18. 19.
burnt with the Fire: So shall then truly the manyfolde-sort of Iniquity and
Variaunce reversed;together with all those that love or practice Iniquity /
Variaunce / and Rentinge; com euenso utterly to an end.

Math. 13. c. 25. d. 2. Pet. 3. a.
into the hellish Fire of the everlasting Damnation: Esa. 66. c. Mark. 9.
wheare the Worm of their gnawinge Conscience does never dye / nether shall
the hellish Fire of their Condemnation / be evermore quenched-out: for their
Condemnation shall endure everlastingly.

4. But the Curious-searchinge and the Accuser Providence and ye Man's

Habergion and Harness / and gyrded with an iron Chain. And both his Hands /
and from his Gyrdel-fourth / even unto the very end of his Feet / he was
very read and weat of Blood. And he had in each Hand a Sword. The Sword in
his Leaft-hande / was also very read and weat of Blood. But the Sword in his
Right-hande / was altogether a glowinge Fire / which glynsened and cracked very
terriblie / with many Firie-flames. And there stood written on his Forehead /
The Vengeance of God.

13. After-that when as this Voice / had so geeuen-fourth his Sound over the

thowsande Angels. All these cried together reversed;with a great Sound; over
the Earth / and over all those which dwelled on the Earth. And the Sound of

18. AFter-that I saw. and behold: These Angels gathered all that to-gether
on an Heap (like-as the Servants of an Husbandman / do gather the Weed
reversed;of the Field; Math. 13. ^. 25. d.
all on an Heap) which remayned-ouer / and was not any upright heavenly or

had separated itself from the Love and her upright Beeinge^ and not respected
the Entrance into his right Beeinge and Ordinance. Math. 13. 25. Apo. 20. c.

Eight Days / which also remained always and for ever / in the Service or
Office of their Light.

3. These Eight Days / were the same Lights / which I had seen before: and
Esa. 66. c.
they were all Holye-dayes of the Lord. And euenso the one Holyedaye followed
on the other / all which were also sanctified / each-one in the Office of his
