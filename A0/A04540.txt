A CHRISTIAN PLEA Containing three Treatises. I. The first, touching the
Anabaptists, and others mainteyning some like errors with them. II. The
second, touching such Christians, as now are here, commonly called Remonstrants
or Arminians. III. The third, touching the Reformed Churches, with whom my
self agree in the faith of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.


Made by FRANCIS JOHNSON, Pastor of the ancient English Church, now
sojourning at Amsterdam in the Low Countries.

Esa. 50.5.6. The Lord has opened mine ear; and I was not rebellious, neither
turned away back. I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that
plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.

Ier. 15, 19. Thus says the Lord, If thou return, then will I bring thee
again, and thou shall stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious
from the evil, thou shall be as my mouth: let them return unto thee, but
return not thou unto them.

2 Timothy 4, 7, 8. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have
kept the Faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give me at that day: and not to me
only, but unto them also that love his appearing.

PRINTED, In the year of our Lord 1617.

To the Christian Reader: Grace mercy and peace be multiplied in Jesus Christ.
CHristian Reader, I do here present unto thee, three Treatises joined together
in one book: which I wish may prove as profitable to the Church and people of
God, as they are needful for this age, and estate of things, wherein we live.
Whereabout there are some few things that I would advertise thee, before thou
come to read the treatises themselves.

1. That thou would observe, how our Lord Jesus Christ, giving ordinances to
his Church under the Gospel, has derived them from the practice and
particulars had among the Jews of old, varying therefro^ as little as might be,
in such a different estate. For example, as they had their Synagogues, so have
we our particular churches and assemblies, Psalm. 74, 8. Mat. 4.23. and 9.35.
with Act. 20.28. Col. 4.16. Rev. 2.1. etc. They had in their Synagogues the
ministration of the word of God and prayer: so likewise have we. Act. 13.14.15.
and 15.21. and 16.13. with Act. 2.42. 1 Cor. 14.3.15.16. 1 Timothy 2.1. and 4.13.
They had for ordinary Sacraments and seals of Gods covenant, Circumcision and
the Passover: See M. Brought. on Dan. 9.25, 26, 27. with that he alleges out
of R. Moses ben Maym. in Asure biah perek 13. And Joseph. de bell. Iud. 6. cap.
31. And Paulus Burgens. in Psalm. 112. and Tremell. and Scaliger de emendat.
tempor. l. 6. And Beza on Matt. 26.20.
we have likewise baptism and the Lords supper answering thereunto. Touching
baptism also, our Lord took it (as some have observed) from the Jews
baptizing of Proselytes, and washing of themselves from uncleannes, which was
known and usual among the^. And the Lords supper likewise, from a custom
observed among the Jews at the Passover: at the end of the celebration
whereof, the fathers of families were wont to take a cake of bread, and after
the blessing thereof, to break and distribute it to the co^munica^ts: as also
after that, a cup of wine, in like sort: Whereunto that may have reference,
which David speaks, saying: What shall I render to the Lord for all his
benefits toward me? I vvil take the cup of salvation, and call on the name of
the Lord. Psa. 116.12, 13. They had Sacrifices, which led the^ to Christ, who
was then to come to dye for our sins: we have in stead thereof the Lords
supper, which confirms unto us that Christ now is come, and has dyed for our
transgressions: the memorial whereof we do still observe, showing forth his
death, til he come again at that great day. Lev. 1. etc. Esa. 53.7 -- 10. Dan.
9.24.26.27. with Ioh. 1.29. 1 Cor. 5.7. and 10.16. and 11.23. etc. They had the
Sabbaths and Feast days for the solemn worship of God, in stead whereof we
have the Lords day. Exo. 20.8. Lev. 23. chapter Esa. 66.23. Zac. 14.16 -- 19. with
Act. 20.6.7. Rev. 1.10. They had Priests for offering the Sacrifices that were
types of Christ's death: we have Pastors for celebration of the Lords supper, a
memorial of his death and passion now performed, and still thankfully to be
remembered. Exodus 28. Lev. 1. Number. 16. 2 Chronicles. 35.1. Ezech. 43, and 44. and 45.
and 46, etc. with 1 Cor. 10. 16. and 11.23. Ephesians. 4.11.12. Col. 4.17. They had
Priests and Levites; we Pastors and Teachers for the work of the Ministry.
Number. 18. Deuteronomy. 33.8 -- 11. 2 Chro. 35 chapter Esa. 66.21. with Ephe. 4.11.12. Romans
12.7.8.

They had for government, besides Priests and Levites, Ruling Elders also, of
the chief of the Fathers of Families among them: and we have for government,
besides the Pastors and Teachers, the Ruling Elders also taken out of the
people, in that behalf. And so, as they had a Synedrion or Consistory of
Elders, consisting of Priests, Levites, and Fathers of Families of the people
among the^: so have we a Presbytery or company of Elders, consisting likewise
of Pastors, Teachers, and Ruling Elders, chosen out of the people for the
churches government. Deu. 19.17. 2 Chro. 19.8. Jer. 19.1. with 1 Timothy 5.17.
Romans 12.7.8. 1 Cor. 12, 28. Act. 20.17.28. Heb. 13.7.17.24. They had for the
Treasury the Leviticall treasurers and other the like, to who^ that business
was committed: we have the Deacons for that use and service in that church. 1
Chro. 26.20 -- 28. 2 Chronicles. 31.12. etc. Neh. 13, 13. with Act. 6. 1 -- 6. 1 Timothy 3. 8 -- 13. They had for censures, Niddui, Cherem, and Schammatha,
Seclusion, Cutting off, and utter devoting to judgment till the Lords coming
at that day. We also have the use of Suspension, of Excommunication, and of
Anathema Maranatha. Number. 19 chapter Esa. 66.5. Jude v. 14 22.23. Luke 6.22. 2 These.
3.6.14.15. 1 Timothy 1.20. 1 Cor. 5.5.11.12.13. and 16.22. Finally, they had
Jerusalem, where God set his name, and the Temple where he dwelt among them,
and whither he required them to come with their sacrifices, etc. Which typed
out unto us not only the Universal church, but the particular churches also
of Christians, where the Lord sets his name, and dwells among us by his
spirit, calling us thither to eat at his Table, and in all things to worship
and serve him according to his word, Deu. 12.5, 6.7. and 16.2. Psa. 26.6, 7, 8.
and 27.4. and 36.8 9. and 65.4. and 132. Esa. 27.13. and 66.23. Dan. 8,
11.13.14. and 11, 31. with Mat. 28.19.20. 1 Cor. 3. 16.17. and 2 Cor. 6.16. 2
These. 2.4. Rev. 3. 12. and 21. 2. etc.

By this may also appear, how M. Ainsw. in his plea against M. Smyth, about the
Ministry, worship, and government of the Church, wrote once well (if he could
have kept unto it) when he asked him, saying: What one thing have we in the
worship of God, which Israel had not before us? M. Ainsw. Defense of Scrip.
page 10. Which being well observed, will give good light to many matters now in
question. But I will proceed to other things.

2. Whereas sometimes I allege many Scriptures together, my meaning is not,
that each of them prove the point in hand; but that to this end they are to be
compared and laid together, and corfirmation of the truth to be derived fro
thence, by consequence, and discourse of reason, as in questions of religion is
woonted to be done.

3. The questions that I set down are diverse: and abort them there is great
diversity of judgment. Touching some of the^ I set down reasons but one way,
and answer the objections to the contrary. For others of the^ sometimes I
propound reasons both ways: and so leave al to be examined and judged of,
according to the word of God. At first, I had thought only to have insisted
upon the points themselves, without mention of any adversaries, or confutation
of any Opposites by name. But afterward, upon diverse weighty reasons, I
changed my purpose and course: and of many Opposites have named a few, and
given a little taste of the manifold Opposition that is made against us: noting
withal a few instances of the many shifts, errors, contradictions, and abuse
of Scriptures, into which they run and are carried exceedingly. M. Ainsw.
Animadv. etc.
Where also I could mention (if I would) sundry manifest untruths published by
some: which are so very untrue, as I need not produce any other proof or witness
herein, but the public records of Amsterdam still extant, and the testimony of
such as were present, and heard and saw what was done: not excepting M. Ainsw.
own followers. Whom now moreover by this occasion I do once again exhort to
consider their ways and estate in their heart: and to call to mind, both how
they have been wanting in yielding and bearing witness to the truth, and how long
now they have continued in their schismatic and scandalous Division from the
Church whereof they were: and that both for the matter, time, and manner
thereof: besides many other sins and transgressions, which they run into
withal. A just recompense of their contumacie, from which they would not be
reclaimed by any means. Neither does it avail the^, that some others joined
hand in hand with the^, becoming (as Simeon and Levi did) brethren in evil. In
such cases we must still remember and observe what Jacob the Patriark said, O
my soul, come not thou into their secret: unto their Or, Church as M. Ains.
does otherwhere usually translat the word KAHAL: which here he does not so.
Note it.
assembly mine honor be not thou united. Genesis 49.5.6.

4. Now of the Anabaptists, and Arminians, I need not speak particularly, Some
of their opinions here following I have noted and refuted, Genesis 37.9. Phil.
2.15. Judge. 5, 31. Prove. 4.18. Dan. 8, 10.12. and 11.31.32. Act. 2.20.40. Rev.
6.12.
both for the more clearing of the truth, and the further helping of others
against their errors, which do now here so much trouble and endaunger the
estate of church and Common wealth. The Reformed churches, may for the faith of
Christ which they profess, well be esteemed (as Israel was of old) in their
measure and degrees, to be as the Sun and moon, the lights of the world:
Which should therefore still increase in all shining light of the truth, and
holiness, shyning more and more unto the perfect day, yea til they go forth as
the Sun in his might: and should be the more careful hereof, seeing the
Scrtpture also teaches, how even Rev. 16.8. etc. Or, by the Sun here,
understand hot persecution. Sal. Song. 1. 6. Mat. 13.6, 21.
upon the Sun, shall a vial of Gods wrath be powered out, before the utter
extyrpation and destuction of the Beasts throne and kingdom: and that the day
is a coming, wherein the moon shall be confounded, and the Sun ashamed, when
the Lord of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his
ancients gloriously. Esa. 24.23. Which whether it shall be at the conversion of
the Jews to the Christian faith (which now hasteneth on) time and the work of
God will manifest: As also, in what manner shall be verified that which the same
Prophet has foretold, saying: The light of the Moon shall be as the light of
the Sun, and the light of the Sun shall be seven fold, as the light of seven
days, in the day that the Lord byndeth up the breach of his people, and
heals the stroke of their wound.

5. In the mean time, who does not observe and lament, that among the
Lutherans and Reformed churches every where, there should still remain so many
and great corruptions, errors, superstitions, and other transgressions, not
redressed or amended in the worship of God, and conversation of men? Which
threaten some heavy judgment of God, not to be far off, if we meet not the
Lord with true and unfeyned repentance in time.

In which regard, al are to be exhorted, carefully and without delay, to think
on their ways, and to turn their feet into the Testimonies of the Lord. Buy
the truth (says Pro. 23.23.
Solomon) but sell it not: Part with any thing for it, but part not with it for
any thing. Enter in at the strait gate (says Matt. 7.13.24.
Christ) for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leads to
destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: but strait is the gate,
and narrow is the way which leads to life, and few there be that find it.
Finally, let us all labor (what in us is) to grow in grace, and in the
knowledge and obedience of the truth, in all things: not regarding the applause
or displeasure of men: but endeavoring to please God more and more, and not
only to know and profeesse in word, but to observe and practice in deed
whatsoever the Lord has commanded us: knowing that Deu. 4, 1, 2. Matt. 28.20.
Ioh. 7.17. and 13, 17. 1 Timothy 6, 13.14.
this has the promise of blessing and acceptance with the Lord. Wherein if
these my poor labors shall any way help and further thee, give praise unto
God: and remember me in thy prayers to the Lord:

In whom I rest and still shall remain thine: FRANCIS JOHNSON, Pastor of the
English exiled church sojourning (for the present) at Amsterdam.

It was not an enemy that reproved me, then I could have borne it; neither was
it he that hated me, that did magnify himself against me, then I would have
hid my self from him. But it was thou, O man, mine equal, my guide, and mine
acquaintance: who took sweet council together, and walked into the house of
God in company,

Psalm. 55.12.13.14 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute
you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.
Rejoice, and be glad: for great is your reward in heaven: For so persecuted
they the Prophets which were before you.

THE FIRST TREATISE. Of some questions concerning the Anabaptists.
CHAPTER I. Whether Baptism is to be administered to Infants being the children
of the faithful, or not.
THE Anabaptists misunderstanding some Scriptures, and not finding in the New
Testament mention of any children by name, that were baptized, hold therefore
that infants are not to be baptized, though they be the children of such as do
believe. The error of which opinion appears by these Scriptures, and reasons
deduced from them, and other the like. Genesis 17.7.12.13.14.26.27. Exo. 12.48.49.
Zach. 2.11. Ephesians. 3.6. with Act. 2, 38, 39. and 3, 25. and 16, 15, 31, 33. 1
Cor. 1, 16. and 7, 14. and 10, 1, 2. Romans 4, 11, 16, 17. and 15, 4, 8, 9, 10.
Gal. 3, 8, 29. Ephesians. 4, 4, 5, 6. Col. 2, 8 -- 12. and Psalm. 22, 30, 31. Esa. 54,
10. Zach. 13, 1. Mar. 10, 13 -- 16.

I.
Because it is the ordinance and commandment of God, to give the sign and
seal of his covenant of grace, to his people and their seed, in their
infancy, throughout their generations. Genesis 17, 7, 12, 13, 14. Exo. 12, 48,
49. with Act. 2, 38, 39. and 3, 25. and 16, 15. Col. 2, 10, 11, 12. Which
ordinance of the Lords has never been repealed, but abides stablished upon a
certain and perpetual ground, that is, his promise and covenant of grace made
with the faithful and their seed for ever. For which see the Scriptures here
cited before: and these also which follow. Luke 1, 54, 55, 72. etc. and 19, 9.
Act. 16, 31. Romans 4, 11, 16, 17. and 15, 8, 9, 10. Gal, 3, 8, 29. Esa. 54, 10.
Mal. 3, 6. Luke 20, 37, 38. Hebr. 11, 13 -- 16. and 13, 8, 20. Rev. 14, 6.

II.
And Christ has confirmed the same, when he sent forth his Apostles and
appointed them Matthew. 28, 18, 19. and Mark 16, 15, 16. with Gal. 3, 8 -- 29.
Genesis 12, 3. and 17, 4, 5, 7, 12, 26, 27. with Act. 16, 15, 31, 33. Romans 4, 9 --
17, and 11.13 -- 16. and 15.8 -- 16. 2 Cor. 1, 20.
to make all the nations disciples, and to baptize them into the name of the
Father the Son and the holy Ghost. For, to make the Gentiles disciples, is by
the Gospel to bring them unto the covenant of God, made with Abraham, the
Father of many nations, for salvation through the name of Jesus Christ. Which
covenant is everlasting, and includes the faithful and their seed: So as
therefore Baptism (which has now succeeded and does seal it in stead of
Circumcision) is by this appointment of Christ to be administered unto all that
be brought and comprehended under that covenant of grace: and consequently both
to such as are of years coming to the faith of Christ, and to their children
being yet infants. And otherwise, Zach. 2, 11. Esa. 42, 6, 7. and 49, 6, 22.
Act. 13, 46, 47. Joh. 10, 16. 1 Cor. 1, 9, 13, 16. and 12, 13. Ephesians. 2, 11 --
22. and 3, 6.
the Gentiles should not with the Jews be joined to the Lord, and become his
people with them, and be made coinheriters, and of the same body, and
joynt-partakers of the same promise of God in Christ, by the Gospel: as the
Scripture teaches.

III.
Which is yet the more manifest, inasmuch as the Scripture speaking both of the
Jews and Christian Gentiles, and of their Sacraments: says, that 1 Cor. 10,
1, 2.
the Jews of old were baptized, and that Col. 2, 11, 12.
the Christians now are circumcized, with circumcision made without hands
(which the Apostle also calls the circumcision of Christ): and that with 1
Cor. 12, 12, 13. and Ephesians. 3, 6. Esa. 49, 6, 22.
both Jews and Gentiles are fellow-heires, and partakers of the same promise
in Christ, and of one and the same body under Christ the head. By which again
it is evident, that Baptism is answerable to circumcision succeeding in the
place thereof, to be the Lords sign and seal of his covenant; and that
Baptism now is to be administered to the believers and their children, as well as
circumcision was heretofore.

IIII.
And this was also the Act. 16, 15, 33. 1 Cor. 1, 16.
Apostles practice, at the publishing of the gospel through the world, to
baptize both the householders themselves that believed, and their households
also: Even like as with Genesis 15, 6. and 17, 26, 27. and 21, 4.
Abraham first believed, and then was circumcised; and all his family with
him: And like as Exodus 12, 48, 49. (And that by the speech of an house,
family, or household, children also are employed therein, see Genesis 30, 25, 30.
and 45, 18, 19. with 46, 5, 6, 7. Number. 3, 15. etc. Psalm. 115, 12, 13, 14. 1 Timothy 5, 8.) Herein therefore Origin says well, that Orig. in Epist. ad Romans
the Church received Baptism of Infants from the Apostles. And Augustine, that
August. contra Donatist. lib. 4 ca. 23.24.
the baptism of Infants was not derived from the authority of man, or
Councils, but from the tradition or doctrine of the Apostles.
the stranger of the Gentiles, which received the faith of the Jews, and would
keep the Passover, was not only circumcised himself, but all the males also
that were his.

V.
Moreover, the children of believers are holy, and are Abraham's seed, and
heirs by promise of the kingdom of heaven and eternal blessedness. And who
can then withhold the baptism of water from them, to whom God vouchsafes the
baptism of his spirit, and the blessing of Abraham to an inheritance
everlasting in his heavenly kingdom? 1 Cor. 7, 14. Romans 11, 16. Act. 3, 25.
Gal. 3, 29. Esa. 46, 3, 4. Psalm. 22, 10, 30, and 71, 6. and 115, 12, 13, 14,
15. Luke 1, 41, 44. Act. 10, 47. Romans 8, 9, 16. Luke 19, 9. Mark 10, 13 -- 16.

VI.
And Baptism is the Lords sign, of his washing away of our sins, receiving
of us into the Church, and incorporating of us into Christ, for salvation by
his death and resurrection: Whereof the children of believers are partakers,
as well as they which be of years: and therefore can no more be deprived of
Baptism, then of remission of sins, entrance in to the Church, ingraffing
into Christ, and salvation by his means. Romans 6, 3, 4. and 5, 14, 15. Zac. 13,
1. 1 Cor. 1, 13 -- 16. and 12, 13. Act. 4, 12. with 16, 30 -- 34. and 22, 16.
Gal. 3, 27, 28, 29. Ephesians. 2, 19. and 5, 25 -- 30. Tit. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Rev 1,
4, 5. Whereupon Origin writes thus: Orig. tom. 2. homil. 14. in Lucam.
Children are baptized for the remission of sins. Of what sins? Or when
have they sinned? Or how can there be any reason of the laver in children, but
according to the sense whereof we spoke? There is none pure from uncleannes, no
not if their life be but one day upon the earth.

VII.
Neither is there any thing required in the ministration of Baptism (nor was
heretofore Genesis 17, 7, 12, 26. and 21, 4.
in circumcision) whereof young infants are not capable, as well as elder
people: whereas in the ministration of the Lords supper it is far otherwise.
For and 1 Cor. 1, 16. Act. 16, 14, 15, 33. Matt. 28, 18, 19. with
in baptism the minister is I speak of the outward agent.
the agent alone, and the person baptized (whether old or young) is only a
patient, and not an agent: but " in the Lords supper (besides the actions laid
upon the Minister) there are diverse actions required also of the receivers; as
namely, to take, to eat, to drink, to do it in remembrance of Christ, to
show forth the Lords death, to examine themselves, and so to eat of that
bread, and drink of that cup. All which actions are required of the receivers
of the Lords supper, whereby they also are made agents therein, and not the
Ministers only. But in baptism it is not so: for in it, the action is wholly
enjoined and laid upon the baptizer, and not upon the baptized. So that even by
the institution and administration of baptism, compared with the institution
and administration of the Lords supper, the truth of this point yet further is
cleared and confirmed unto us. Matthew. 26, 26, 27, 28, and 1 Cor. 11, 23 -- 28.


VIII.
And there is likewise Ephe. 4, 4.5, 6.
one Baptism, as there is 1 Cor. 12, 13. and 10, 1, 2. with Exo. 12, 37. 1
Pet. 3, 20, 21. with Genesis 7, 1. Gal. 3, 8, 27, 28, 29.
one body, and 1 Timothy 2, 5. Joh. 10, 16.
one Mediator and confirmer of one covenant of grace, to the faithful and their
seed in all ages. So as therefore Act. 2, 38, 39. Psalm. 100, 3, 5. Ephe. 1, 22,
23. and 2, 19 -- 22. and 5, 23, 25, 26, 27, 32.
one and the same baptism perteyneth to the children of the faithful together
with the parents themselves: as they are also of one and the same body with
them, having one and the same Mediator and ratifyer of Gods covenant of grace
unto them, even Jesus Christ, the head and Savior of his Church, which is his
body, the fulness of him that fills al in all things.

IX.
Besides that the Children of Believers being under the covenant of God, and
perteyning to Christ and to his church and kingdom, they are therefore now to
be distinguished from the children of unbeleevers by a sign of difference, and
consequently by baptism, as the children of the faithful were of old by
circumcision. Otherwise there should now be a greater confusion, without
difference betvveen the church and the world, then was heretofore; and the
children of believers, which the Apostle says are holy, should be brought
into one and the same rank and estate with the unclean children and seed of
unbeleevers. Contrary to the Apostles doctrine, 1 Cor. 7, 14. compared with
Matthew. 19, 14. and Esa. 52, 1. Judge. 14, 3, 1 Samuel 14, 6. and 17, 36. 2 Cor. 6,
14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

X.
Else also the grace of God to his people should now since Christ his coming
in the flesh be lessened and straightened more then it was before; the comfort
and confirmation of the faithful for themselves and their children should not
now be so great and so fully ratified by Christ, as formerly it was; and we
should not now be so compleete and thoroughly furnished in Christ, as they
aforetime were: Finally by their opinion (being well observed) it would
follow, that neither the Scriptures have given assurance of the recalling of
the Jews, nor the Apostles sufficiently ansvvered such as urged circumcision
upon the Gentiles, etc. Which things to affirm or admit, is highly to derogate
from the grace of God, the fullness of Christ and his Gospel, the comfort of
Christians, the sure hope of the ingraffing again of the Jews, the
faithfulness of the Apostles and sufficiency of their doctrine recorded in the
Scriptures. And so contrary to that which is written, Col. 2, 8 -- 12. Rom,
4, 11 -- 24. and 11, 11 -- 36. and 15, 4. Genesis 7, 1. with 1 Pet. 3, 18 -- 22. 1
Cor. 1, 16. and 10, 1 -- 4. Luke 19, 9. Esa 49, 6. Act. 15, 1 -- 31: and 16,
15, 33. and 26, 6, 7.22, 23. Gal. 1, 6 -- 9. and 3, 8 -- 29. Ephesians. 2, 18, 19.
Hebr. 13, 8. Rev. 13, 8. and 14, 6, and 21, 3; 9, 10, 11, 12. etc.

OBJECTION I.
But the Anabaptists still object, Why then is there not in the New Testament,
mention of some child by name, that was baptized?

ANSWER.
1. The particular mention of any such by name, needed not to be in the new
Testament: because the commandment of sealing children with the sign of Gods
covenant, was before in Israel; and is a moral and perpetual ordinance of
God, as was shevved here before, Page 1. and appears likewise in the books
of the old Testament: where some children by name (that were sealed with the
sign of circumcision) are particularly mentioned: Genesis 21.4 Exodus 4, 24, 25,
26. as some also be in the books of the New Testament, in Luke 1, 59. and 2,
21. And this point ( viz. that the New Testament needed not repeat the things
had in Israel, which were moral and perpetual) is the more to be noted:
because the due observation thereof clears not only this matter in hand, but
diverse other questions also, about the sacraments, and other things concerning
the churches vvorshipp, order, government, estate, and course of life among
Christians. Which while it has not ben observed, as it should, ^^ch error
and trouble about sundry things in the Church among ^^ristians has risen, and
is still continued, to the great hinderance of ^^e truth, and dishnour of the
Name of God.

The special things to be declared in the New Testament, were the ^^hibiting
of the Messiah in the flesh, for the redemption of his people; ^^e opening of
that mystery of the incarnation of the Son of God, his ^^fferings, death,
burial, resurrection, ascension into heaven, and sit^^ng at the right hand of
God; the fulfilling and correction of the sha^^vves and ceremonies of the Law;
the manifestation and establish^ent of such things, as coming in stead
thereof, should not be shaken, but endure to the end; the spreading of the
Gospel abroad in the world, and the opening of the mystery of the Gentiles
calling; with such like things: as may be seen in the histories of the Gospel
written by the Evangelists: and particularly, Matthew. 1, 1. etc. Mark 1, 1, 2,
etc. Luke 1, and 2, and 3, and 4, etc. and 24, 44 -- 48. Ioh. 20, 31. Matt. 26,
^7 -- 29. and 28, 18, 19, 20. John 19, 30, 36. And in the Acts of the Apostles.
And in their Epistles throughout. Romans 1, 2, etc. and 16, 25, 26. Galat. 4.
chap. Ephesians. 4, 5, 6. Col. 1, 25, 26, 27, 28. and 2. chap. The Epistles to
Timothee, Titus, and the Hebrews. 1 Pet. 5, 12. Revel. 2, 24, 25. and 19, 9,
10. etc.

Other things that were moral, and formerly had in Israel, needed not be
repeated, but still to be learned out of Moses and the Prophets, and
perpetually to be retained. (Of which sort, this particular of sealing the
children of believers, is one.) 2 Timoth. 3, 16, 17. Luke 16, 29, 31. Romans 15,
4. 1 Cor. 4, 6. Heb. 13, 8. 2 Pet. 1, 19. with Josh. 1, 8. Psalm. 119, 142. Esa.
8, 20.

Neither does it hinder that some moral things sometimes are repeated in the
books of the New Testament: seeing that all such things are not repeated in
the new, as they are set down in the Old; and sundry reasons may be
observed in sundry places (where some are repeated or spoken off) why it
was good and needful so to do. Which were long to insist upon. As in Matthew.
5, 21 -- 44. and 9, 13. and 18, 15, ^, 17. and 19, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Mark 7,
10, 11, 12, 13. Luke 17, 3. Act. 7, ^^ Romans 13, 7, 8, 9, 10. 1 Cor. 6, 9, 10.
and 10, 7, 8, 9, 10. Ephesians. 5, 3, 4, ^6 -- 14. 1 Timoth. 1, 8, 9, 10, 11. and
5, 17, 18. Hebr. 12, 5, 14, 15, 16. and 13, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Iam. 2, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12. 1 Pet. 1, 15, 16, 17. and 3, (...) etc. Revel. 2, 14, 20. and 19, 10.

Nor is there in such case any weight in the exception that is made about the
abolition of the ceremonies, or about the differences between them and us, and
between their ministration and ours: seeing we speak ^^ely of such things as
are moral, or do agree in their general proper^^, and common equity, which
abides for ever. Of which I shall speak ^ore hereafter in the answer of the
fifth objection.

Now then seeing the ministration of the seal of Gods covenant, unto ^^^ldren,
was had in Israel, and is a moral and perpetual ordinance of God: seeing also
in the Old Testament there is mention of some children by name, that were so
circumcised, and in the New Testament we are taught, that baptism is now unto
us in stead of circumcision ( Col. 2, 11, 12) it is therefore evident, that
there needed not be, in the New Testament, particular mention of any children
by name, that were baptized. Yea if the names of some children so baptized, had
been particularly expressed, yet should we notwithstanding look to the ground
whereupon it was done, and to the ordinance of God thereabout. Which we may now
do as well, as if their names were mentioned in particular. And this may be
sufficient to satisfy such as are of judgment and indifferency.

2. Besides that, the precepts, practice, and reasons which are mentioned in
the New Testament, about the ministration of Baptism, (if they be duly
weighed) do as necessarily imply the baptizing of the children of the
faithful together with themselves, as well as if their names had been
particularly set down. Of which see here before, page 1. etc.

3. Yea there is express mention of children, Act. 2, 39. where there is also
speech of baptism, for the remission of sins, in the name of Christ; and the
reason thereof annexed, (in regard of the promise made also unto children) ver.
38, 39. Whereabout observe withal, whether the precepts of the Scripture are
not to reach so far, as the reasons annexed thereunto do extend. As in Deu.
7, 1 -- 4. compared with Ezra 9, 1, 2, 11, 12. and 2 Chronicles. 21, 6. and many
other the like. And so in this place, where there is mention of children in the
reason, that therefore the precept of baptizing, here spoken of, implies them
also. Act. 2, 38, 39. Otherwise how will the Anabaptists prove, by the
institution, or first celebration of the Lords Supper, that women should be
partakers thereof: seeing that (neither there, nor other where in the New
Testament) there is mention of any women by name, that were present and did
partake thereof. And yet seeing the reasons that are annexed to the precepts
thereof, do necessarily implye women as well as men, and there is no where any
special prohibition to the contrary: who can deny it unto them, without great
sin and impiety? Matthew. 26, 17, 20.26, 27, 28. Luke 22, 14, 19, 20. 1 Cor.
11, 23, 24, 25. Not to speak, how they were admitted to the Passover; in stead
whereof we have the Lords supper: nor of other reasons that might be alleged
thereabout.

4. Lastly, there is express mention, not only of baptizing the fathers and
mothers of families, but also of their house or household, and all that were
theirs. Act. 16, 15, 33. 1 Cor. 1.16. And both the term of an house, family
or household, implies the children therein, as the Scripture plainly shows,
Page 2.
(as I showed before) Genesis 30, 25 -- 30. compared with 1 Timothy 5, 9. Pro. 31,
15. Luke 19, 9. Judge. 1, 25. and Genesis 45, 18, 19. with ver. 10, 11. and 46, 5,
6, 7. Exodus 1, 1. Numb. 3, 15, 39. Psalm. 115, 12.13, 14. and in other like
places, where there is not any restreint annexed, as sometimes there is, as in
Genesis 50, 7, 8. Number. 32, 16, 17, 18, 26, 27. and the other phrase (where it is
said, the Iaylour was baptized, and) all that were his, compriseth also
children therein: as ^^y be seen Numb. 16, 30, 33. compared with ver. 27. where
the like phrase is ^^ed and explaned. as when in one verse he says of Dathan
and Abiram, ^^^y, their wives, their sons, and their little children, ver. 27.
and in other verses ^ayth, they and all that apperteined unto them, or, they,
and all that were theirs. ver. ^^, 33. Where it is further to be noted, that in
the same place speaking concerning Korah, he says not generally, as he did of
Dathan and Abiram, (...) that apperteined to Korah, but he restreyneth it,
saying, all the men that apperteyned to Korah, ver. 32. so exempting the
children of Korah, who dyed not with the rest there spoken off. Numb. 26, 11.
Which also plainly shows, how in such cases the children are comprised in the
general phrase, of all that were theirs, where there is no restraint in the
speech, or exception to the contrary: as in the place aforesaid.

OBJECTION II.
But it is said of the Iaylour, in this place of the Acts, that the word of the
Lord was preached to him, and to all that were in his house, and that he
rejoiced, believing with all his household. Act. 16, 32, 34. Whereof children
(say they) being not capable, therefore there were no children here, or if
there were any, they were not baptized.

ANSWER.
1. Neither of these two collections of theirs, will follow thereupon. It is
an usual thing in the Scripture, and in all tongues, to use such speeches in
general cases, of houses, cities, and the like: wherein yet every particular
person or thing is not either employed, or denied to be at al, as here they
would gather. For example, when it is said, The Lord closed up all the vvombs
of Abimilecks household, Genesis 20, 17, 18. and the house of Pharaoh heard, Genesis
45, 2, 16. the city of Shushan rejoiced, Ester 8, 15. all Jerusalem was
troubled, Mat. 2, 3. all the city was moved, Matthew. 21, 10. what a vain and
unreasonable collection were it to gather, that either there were no children
in these houses and cities, or else that they also were so entreated and
affected, as here is said.

2. Neither can such phrases hinder, but that the other speech, where it is
said, he was baptized, and all his, may imply the children with the father
himself. Act. 16, 33. Like as I showed here before, out of Numb. 16, 27, 30.
And as in this same chapter, where it is said only of Lydia, (the mother of
the family) that she heard Paul, and the Lord opened her heart, so as she
attended to the words which he spoke: yet this hinders not, but that both she
was baptized and her householde; of whom notwithstanding it is not said, that
they heard Paul, and believed; but this here is only spoken of Lydia her self:
who being by Paul's preaching brought to the faith of Christ, she was baptized,
and her household with her. Act. 16, 14, 15.

3. And if children should not have been baptized, as before they had ^^n
circumcised: here was both fit place, and just occasion, for the Apostles
themselves, and for the Scripture (recording their acts) to have made ^^ception
of children expressly; and not to have used such speeches and terms, as in
other places of the Scripture are used, to include and imply children therein:
as we have shevved here before. So as even hereby we may therefore learn,
Page 2. and 4.
and be more assured, that in the ministration of baptism the Apostles still
retained like practice, as had been bsed before in circumcising of children,
when the fathers of families believed, and had received circumcision
themselves. Genesis 17, chap. and 21, 4. Exodus 12, 48, 49.

OBJECTION III.
But Christ commanded the Apostles first to teach, and then to baptize Matthew.
28, 18, 19. And so the Apostles practiced, Act. 2, 14 -- 41. and 8, 35 -- 38.
and 10, 34 -- 48. and 16.14, 15, 31, 32, 33, 34. and 18, 4 -- 8.

ANSWER.
1. The Word of God is not the bare letter or outward syllables, but the
intendement and meaning of the holy Ghost, by whom it was given Which should
carefully be observed by the due consideration of the Scriptures, with the
circumstances thereof, and by the conference of other places of Scripture, and
the proportion of faith laid together. Which vvhiles the Anabaptists neglect,
they look on the Scripture partially, and press the letter extremely,
without consideration of the true and right meaning thereof: neither observing
the time and persons, of whom the Scripture speaks, nor conferring the
Scriptures of the old and new Testament together, nor regarding the analogy
and proportion of faith, as they should. Much like as the Papists deal, when
they press the letter, in other words of Christ, where it is said, This is
my body: Matthew. 26, 26. and others also, in those words, Tell the Church,
etc. Matthew. 18, 17. So in much like manner do the Anabaptists in these, Teach
all nations, and baptize them, etc. Matthew. 28, 19. Where the Scripture it self
being duly weighed, and compared together with other places, according to the
proportion of faith, it will be found necessarily to imply the baptizing of
children, and so to be directly against themselves. The word here used,
signifies to make scholars or disciples, and consequently to teach: as may be
seen, in Mat. 27, 57. Act. 14, 21. Matt. 13, 52. Now the thing to be taught the
nations, that they might become disciples of Christ, was the Gospel: as Mark
shows, when he relates the same commission, saying, Go into all the world,
and preach the Gospel to every creature. Mark 16, 15. And what Gospel? Even
that which was preached before unto Abraham: As the Apostle teaches
expressly, when he says that the Scripture (foreseeing that God would
justify the heathen through faith) preached before the Gospel unto Abraham,
saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. Gal. 3, 8. Now to Abraham and his
seed were the promises made. He says not, And to seeds, as of many, but as of
one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. ver. 16. And whosoever are Christ's,
they are also Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. ver. 29. For
if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to
Abraham by promise. ver. 18. Which Gospel, and promise given unto Abraham, the
Apostles were by Christ appointed to teach and make known in the world, that
the Gentiles should (...) fellow heirs (with the Jews) and of the same body,
and joint partakers of Gods ^^omise in Christ, by the Gospel. Ephesians. 3, 6.
with Genesis 12, 3. and 17, 7. and 22, 18. ^^om which Scriptures compared
together, and understood according to the proportion of faith, we learn, that
the Gospel preached, and promise made unto Abraham, comprehends all that are
Christ's, Psalm. 47, 3 4, 8, 9. Zac. 2, 11.
whether Jews or Gentiles: and that the Gentiles being by the Gospel made
fellovv-heires, and of the same body with the Jews, and joynt-partakers of
Gods promise in Christ; it must therefore needs follow hereupon, that their
children, as well as the children of the Jews, are together with their Parents
under the covenant of grace, and to be made partakers of the seal thereof
with them. Which things the Apostles knovving well, did therefore accordingly
understand the commission of Christ: and thereupon also publishing the Gospel
abroad in the world, baptized not only the Fathers of families, but those
also that were theirs: as the Scriptures before alleged do manifest.

2. Neither in deed could the Apostles any otherwise understand, nor might
they any otherwise practice, the commission aforesaid: seeing by this means
the Gentiles should become the Lords people, as the Jews were; and the
Christian church now succeeded into the place of the church of Israel, under
one and the same Lord, having one and the same covenant in Christ, with like
benefit and mystery of the Sacraments unto them both: as the Prophets had
foretold. Esa 49, 5 -- 22. and 60, chap. and 66, 18 -- 23. Hos. 1, 10. and 2,
23. Amos 9, 11, 12. Micah 4, 1, 2. Zach. 2, 11. and 13, 1. with Act. 13, 46,
47. and 15, 14 -- 18. Romans 9, 24, 25, 26. 1 Cor. 5, 7. and 10, 1 -- 4. and 12,
12, 13. Ephesians. 2, 11 -- 22. and 3, 6. and 4, 4, 5, 6. Phil. 3, 3. In so much
that the Apostle Paul expressly says, the Israelites of old were baptized 1
Cor. 10.2. and the Christians now are circumcised, Col 2, 11. though not
according to the outvvard ceremony, yet according to the spiritual
intendement and mystery thereof. And moreover, that the aforesaid promise of
the Gospel made unto Abraham, includes the kinreds and families of the earth
among the Gentiles (which all the world knovves have children in them) as
well as the families of the Jews. According as the Apostle Peter speaking to
the Jews alleges it, when he says, Ye are the children of the Prophets,
and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And
in thy seed shall all the kinreds (or families) of the earth be blessed. Act.
3, 25. with Genesis 12, 3. and 22, 18. Where mark, that he uses the word,
kinreds, or fathers-families (so to speak, according as the word in the
original is derived:) as it were of purpose to imply herein the kinreds of
the Gentiles, the families and children together with their fathers. According
as the Apostles also observed, in their practice, baptizing the families
together with the fathers thereof: as appears in the Scriptures aforesaid.
Clean contrary to the opinion and practice of the Anabaptists, who have no
regard of the kinreds or families in this behalf: but only of that which such
as are of years, being taught, profess for them selves from time to time.

3. Neither do they (as they should) consider the time, and persons, spoken of
in the Scriptures alleged by themselves. The time was, at the first publishing
of the Gospel abroad among all nations, and manifesting that Jesus was the
Christ now come in the flesh. The persons were, both Jews, and Gentiles, of
all the nations of the world, beginning at Jerusalem, and going through Judea,
and Samaria, and so to the uttermost parts of the earth. Matthew. 28, 18.19. Mar.
16, 15. with Luke 24.46, 47, 48. and Act. 1, 8. and 2, 4, 5. etc. Now for the
Jews, although they were already the church and people of God under his
covenant, yet were they to have knowledge given them, that the Christ was
now come, whom they expected, according to the promise of God concerning him,
and that Jesus was he, who was put to death among them, and risen again
from the dead. Which the Apostles therefore taught and witnessed unto them:
calling them to repentance, and faith in his name for remission of sins:
according as Christ had appointed them to do. Luke 24, 46, 47, 48. with Act.
2, 5 -- 38. etc. and then withal instructing and exhorting them to be baptized
in his name, alleged this ground and reason thereof, because the promise was
to them, and to their children. Act. 2, 39. making express mention of
children: and so showing how they understood the aforesaid commission of
Christ, to imply the children, together with the Parents themselves Which is
directly against the Anabaptists. And as for the Gentiles, they being aliens
from the common wealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenant and promise
of God, they were also to be taught the Gospel: because in the calling of
such, God always begins with those that are of years, and will have faith
and obedience to be required of them before they be baptized. Ephesians. 2, 11 --
22. with Act. 16, 31, 32, 33. Which therefore the Apostles accordingly
observed. But then also when such were brought to the faith of Christ, they did
together with them baptize their households: as has been showed before. Which
is likewise directly against the Anabaptists. Page 2.
The same course we acknowledge is still to be observed, when we have to deal
with like persons in such cases. For example, in dealing with any Pagans,
Turks, or other the like that believe not in Christ, we should first preach
the Gospel unto them, to bring them to the faith: and then when any of them
believe and become disciples of Christ, we should baptize them, and their
households, as the Apostles did. Thus if the Anabaptists would but consider the
times, persons, and cases, as they ought, they might soon see their error,
and learn to put difference (otherwise then they do) between the unbeleeving
Gentiles, and the children of believing Christians; between the baptized and
unbaptized, whether Jews or Gentiles, old and young. Which whiles they do
not, they understand things generally, which are spoken respctiuely: and so
misapply the Scriptures: which being rightly understood, overthrow those very
things for which they allege them: as in the case and Scriptures aforesaid may
be seen. Yea and (that which is worst of al) if the point in hand be well
minded, they bring in another Gospel, which the Scripture ^ever taught: or in
deed pervert and diminish (if not deny) the Gospel, which the Scripture
preached to Abraham, and the Apostles to the nations over the world (whiles
they deny the covenant of Gods grace; or Baptism the seal thereof to
apperteyne to the children of the faithful) as by that which has been said
hereabout may sufficiently appear.

OBJECTION IIII.
But it is not right to reason thus from Abraham, or from circumcision: seeing
that circumcision was given to Abraham's carnal seed, for a carnal seal, of a
carnal covenant and temporary promise, touching the land of Canaan: whereas
Baptism apperteyneth to the spiritual seed of Abraham, and has heavenly
promises of salvation and eternal life, by Jesus Christ.

ANSWER.
1. Abraham in deed had a carnal seed, and temporary promises: but not such
only. For he had also a spiritual seed, and spiritual promises: whereof
circumcision was the seal: As the Lord himself showed at the first institution
thereof, when he stablished his everlasting covenant with Abraham and his seed,
to be his God; and the God of his seed after him. Genesis 17, 7 -- 10. Now God is
our God, only in Christ: in whom the covenant was established by his blood,
and confirmed with the seal of circumcision. As the Apostle plainly teaches,
Gal. 3, 17. and Hebr. 13, 20. and thereupon calls the sign of circumcision,
a seal (not of an earthly or temporary promise) but of the righteousness of
faith: which is heavenly and spiritual. Romans 4, 11. with Genesis 12, 3. and 15,
5, 6 and 17, 7 -- 13. and 22, 18. Gal. 3, 19 -- 29.

2. If they mean by a carnal seal, an outward visible seal: so also is
Baptism: but will they therefore call it a carnal seal? If they mean, that
it was visible in the flesh: there was a special reason thereof (besides that
we also have washing with water, or sprinkling of water upon the flesh:) for
it was to be with blood, and to lead them to Christ, who should come of
Abraham's seed according to the flesh. Genesis 12, 3. and 17, 11. and 22, 18. and
Exodus 4, 26. with Heb. 2, 14, 15, 16. Yet does not this hinder us to reason
from circumcision to Baptism: as the Apostle shows, who so reasons
himself. Col. 2, 10, 11, 12. and as we do also (after the Apostles example)
from the Passover and other sacrifices, to the Lords supper. 1 Cor. 5, 6, 7,
8. and 10, 16, 17, 18.

3. And where they call it a carnal covenant, which circumcision sealed: what
a strange manner of speech and opinion is this? The promise of Canaan
(whereunto they would restreyne it) was in deed annexed with the everlasting
covenant, which God made with Abraham in Christ, for eternal blessedness and
salvation in him. But Canaan it self, was a type of the heavenly inheritance,
and of the kingdom of God, in Jesus Christ. Which also, even that joining of
them together may imply. Genesis 17, 7, 8. with 22, 18. and Gal. 3, 15 -- 29.
Besides that now with us also godlynes has the promise of the life that now
is, and of that which is to come. 1 Timothy 4, 8. Shall we therefore call this a
carnal promise? Does not God himself, who made the covenant with Abraham, call
it his everlasting covenant, Genes. 17, 7. and the Apostle likewise, Heb. 13,
20. And shall we then call or count it a carnal covenant? Was not the promise
this, that in Abraham's seed all families of the earth should be blessed? Genesis
12, 3. and 22, 18. with Act. 3, 25. and Gal. 3, 8. And, that the Lord would be
a God to Abraham, and to his seed after him? Genesis 17, 7, 8. And was this then a
carnal covenant? Yea was was not the covenant confirmed in Christ: and that
also, 430 years before the Law was given? Gal. 3, 17. Or was it not confirmed
to Abraham by the sign of circumcision, as a seal annexed to the promise of
God? Genesis 17 chap. with Act. 7, 8. Which the Apostle calls, the seal of the
righteousness of faith. Romans 4, 11. And was this then a carnal seal, of a
carnal covenant? How directly contrary are such sayings and opinions to the
word of God?

4. If Circumcision was the seal only of the temporary covenant of the land
of Canaan: what then did it profit Abraham himself in this behalf, to whom God
gave no inheritance in it, no not so much as the breadth of a foot. Act. 7, 5.
But Abraham by faith sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange
country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of
the same promise. For he (even as we) looked for a city which has foundations,
whose builder and maker is God. And, they desired a better country, that is,
an heavenly: Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God. Heb. 11,
9.10, 16. From which very speech, that God is the God of Abraham, Isaak, and
Jacob, Exodus 3, 6, 15, 16. Christ proves the resurrection from the dead.
Matthew. 22, 31, 32. Luke 20, 37, 38. Which also shows the covenant made with
Abraham to be a spiritual and everlasting covenant.

5. If Circumcision was the seal to Abraham's carnal seed, touching the land
of Canaan: why then did not circumcision cease, when they enjoyed and possessed
the land? For Sacraments cease, when the promises are fulfilled, whereof they
are signs, and seals: as the very terms of a sign, and seal, may imply.
And thereupon it is, that we shall have no need or use of prophecies,
Sacraments, or other like things, in the kingdom of heaven after this life, as
now we have in this life here on earth. 1 Cor. 13, 8, 12. with chap. 11, 23 --
26.

6. If Circumcision was a seal to Abraham and his carnal seed, only of a
carnal covenant or temporary promise touching the land of Canaan: why then
did God appoint the proselytes of the Gentiles that came to the Passover, and
their children, to be circumcised: seeing they were not of Abraham's carnal
seed, nor had the promise of the land of Canaan? Exodus 12, 48, 49. But in deed
circumcision sealed to them the same righteousness of faith, (and so the
spiritual covenant of God in Christ) as it did to Abraham, and the Jews that
were his carnal seed. Romans 4, 11. with Genesis 12, 3. and 15, 5, 6. and 17, 7 --
13. with Exodus 12, 48, 49.

7. And whereas Mr. Sm. repl. to M. Clift. Arg. 2.
some say, that circumcision was also a seal of obedience to the law of Moses:
how can this be, when as it was appointed to Abraham four hundred and thirty
years before the Law was given? Gal. 3, 17. with ^en. 12, 3. and 17 chap. And
Moses himself was not borne, till diverse gene^^tions after Abraham. Genesis 21,
2, 3. and 25, 19, 26. and 29, 21, 34. with Exodus 6, 16 -- 20. True it is, that
as Circumcision was also one of the ceremonies, being repeated and required in
Moses Law ( Lev. 12, 3.) so they that were circumcised (after the Law was
given) became debtors to do the whole law. Gal. 5, 3. But as it was of the
Fathers, and not of Moses, being before appointed to Abraham, to whom the
Gospel was preached, and the covenant confirmed, four hundred and thirty
years before the Law, ( Genesis 17, 7 -- 13. Joh. 7, 22. Gal. 3, 8, 17.) so it
was a seal of the righteousness of faith, and of the remission of sins in
Christ. Romans 4, 1 -- 11. Also we that are now baptized, are bound to observe
all things, whatsoever Christ has commanded. Matt. 28, 18, 19, 20. Yet
notvvithstanding baptism to us, is the seal (not of our obedience, no nor of
our faith, but) of the righteousness of faith, and of the Lords forgiving our
sins, in Jesus Christ. Romans 4, 1 -- 11 -- 25. and 6, 3. with Act. 2, 38, 39.
and 22, 16. For the seal of God (in circumcision and Baptism) confirms a
perfect sure and firm covenant, even the Lords everlasting covenant of grace (
Genesis 17, 7 -- 13. Deu. 32, 4. Psalm. 111, 9 and 145, 17. Romans 11, 29. Rev. 14, 6.
and Heb. 13, 20 with Act. 2, 38, 39. and 3, 25.) whereas our faith and
observation of the Lords commandments, like as theirs in Israel, is infirm
and unperfit. Matt. 6, 30. and 8, 26. Mar. 9, 24. Luke 17, 5. and Romans 7, 12 --
25. Jam. 3, 2. 1 John 1, 8, 9, 10. And it is our comfort in tentations, that
although we are vveak and sinful, yet the Lords covenant of grace, confirmed
unto us in baptism, as it was to them in circumcision, is firm and holy,
even an everlasting covenant, established by the death and blood shedding of
Jesus Christ: who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and
sanctification, and redemption: that according as it is written, He that
glories, let him glory in the Lord. 1 Cor. 1, 30, 31. and Jer. 9, 23. with
Hebr. 13, 20.

8. Moreover, to be of the carnal seed of Abraham, which is so much objected,
did not hinder the Jews, but that they might also be his spiritual seed in
Christ. And so they are acknowledged by the Apostles, who call them the
children of the promise, and of the covenant which God made with the fathers,
saying to Abraham, In thy seed shall al kinreds of the earth be blessed. Act.
2, 39. and 3, 25. Gal. 3, 15 -- 29. Romans 11, 16. etc.

9. Finally, their outvvard circumcision, signified and taught them, the
inward and spiritual circumcision of the heart, by the spirit of God, in
Christ: like as our outvvard baptism, shows and teaches us the very same
thing: which is wrought by the sanctification of the spirit, and by the
cleansing of us from our sins, in the blood of Jesus Christ. Col. 2, 11, 12.
Deuteronomy. 10, 16. and 30.6. with Act. 15, 10, 11. and Romans 6, 3 -- 6. 1 Cor. 6, 11.
Tit. 3, 4 -- 7. 1 Pet. 3, 21.

OBJECTION V.
But there is great difference between the Jews and us; between their estate
before Christ, being then as in the infancy, and ours since Christ, being
grown in years; between their administration and ours; and particularly,
between their circumcision and our baptism; for circumcision was for the males
only, and to be done the eight day; whereas baptism is both for male and
female, to be done at any time, etc, and the ceremonies had in Israel, are now
abolished: etc

ANSWER.
1. The objection is not of weight: though it be common to others (with the
Anabaptists) in other cases, who in this matter see the vanity of it
themselves. For first, as I noted before, we speak only of such things as are
moral in their own nature, or agree in a general and perpetual equity, and
in their like common property, end, and benefit: and so far forth are
perpetual, how ever there be differences otherwise about some outvvard
circumstances, accidents, and other like things, according to the diverse
dispensation of the Old and New Testament. As may be observed in the Apostles
writings, and in the reasons and allegations made therein: which are taken not
only from the Of which see before page 5.
moral law, but even from the shadows and ceremonies of Moses: as may be seen
in these places, and the like, Col. 2, 11, 12. with Rom 4, 11, 12. Matthew. 5,
23, 24, 25. and 26, 17 -- 29. Joh. 1, 29. Act. 1^, 14 -- 17. Romans 12, 1. and
15, 4, 16. 1 Cor. 3, 16, 17. and 5, 6, 7, 8. and 6, 19, 20. and 9, 13, 14. and
10, 16, 17, 18. Gal. 4, 21 -- 31. and 5, 1 -- 9 -- 13. Phil. 2, 17, and 3.2, 3.
2 These. 2, 4. The Epistle to the Hebrews. 1 Pet. 1, 15, 16, 19. and 2, 5. Jude
ver. 23. Rev. 1, 12. and 2, 17. and 3, 5, 12. and 19, 8. and 21, 2, 3. etc. By
which may appear, that although the outward ceremonies themselves be
abolished, yet the spirit and equity of them still remains; and that from
them (which then were had in Israel) we should now in the time of the
Gospel derive and fetch reasons, instructions, applications, and directions
for the churches use and benefit continually: as I shall by and by observe more
particularly.

2. But first let us note to this purpose also the doctrine and phrases used by
the Prophets: which may give further light about the question in hand. As when
Esaias speaking of the time of the Gospel, calls the Christians the brethren
of the Jews, and foretells how they shall be brought for an offering unto
the Lord out of all nations, to Jerusalem the Lords holy mountain, as the
children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel, into the house of the
Lord: that the Lord will also take of them for Priests and Levites: And that
from one New Moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, al flesh shall
come to worship before the Lord. Esa. 66, 18 -- 23. And Jeremy the Prophet,
Thus says the Lord, David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the
house of Israel. Neither shall the Priest, the Levites want a man before me to
offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice
continually. etc. Jer. 33, 17, 18. etc. And Ezechiels prophecy, from the 40
chap. to the end, treats of the restoration of the church, kingdom, and
people of God by Christ, and so of the constitution of the Christian Church,
under the terms and types, of the Temple, ministry, worship, city, land,
commonwealth and kingdom of the Jews. Ezech. 40 -- 48. chap. And (to omit
other of the Prophets) Zachary foretells that the nations shall be joined to
the Lord, and shall be his people: Zac. ^^ 11. And again, that the Gentiles
shall come to seek the Lord of Hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the
Lord: And shall take hold of the skirt of the Jews, to go with them. Zach. 8,
22, 23. And shall go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of
Hosts, and to keep the feast of Tabernacles. Also, in that day shall there be
upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS TO THE LORD, and the pottes in the Lords
house shall be like the bowls before the Altar. Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and
in Judah shall be Holiness unto the Lord of Hosts, and they that sacrifice shall
come and take of them, and sees therein: and in that day there shall be no
more the Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts. Zach. 14, 16, 20, 21.
And many the like speeches may be observed throughout the Prophets, foretelling
the time of the Gospel, with the mercies of God, and our duties therein;
which cannot be rightly understood or observed as we should, without
reference to the ceremonies and state of Israel heretofore. Which also plainly
shows the abolition of those shadows and ceremonies to be such, as that yet
still the truth and equity of them remains, and is perpetual, for the
churches instruction, comfort, and direction continually.

3. And now that I am giving some instances out of the Prophets, I will (before
I come to mention also some particulars in the Apostles writings to like
purpose) note yet further (in diverse respects) that which the Prophet Amos
has, touching the kingdom of Christ in the Christian Church of the Gospel,
when he brings in the Lord himself speaking thus, In that day will I raise
up the tabernacle of David, that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof
(or hedge the breaches of them,) and I will raise up his ruins, and I will
build it as in the days of old: that they may possess the remnant of Edom,
and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, says the Lord that does
this. Amos 9, 11, 12. Thus prophesied Amos of old. Whose speech, how should it
be understood, or these things observed in the Church and kingdom of Christ,
built up among the Jews and Gentiles, in the time of the Gospel (whereof the
Prophet speaks) if we should not now look unto David, and to the estate of
his house and kingdom, as it was heretofore: and still have relation
thereunto, in the Churches constitution, reformation, ministration, and
proceeding: alvvayes endeavoring to have the spiritual truth, comfort and
benefit thereof more and more among us? To which end, all the phrases here used
by the Prophet are well to be minded, for the manifold use that may be made
thereof. And this Scripture I do the rather more particularly insist upon,
because the Apostles did thus understand and apply it, in a controversy that
was about circumcision, in their time: Act. 15, 1 -- 17. Where when they
disputed, how the Gentiles were to be free from circumcision and the yoke of
Moses Law (which had before ben as a partition wall betvveen the Jews and
Gentiles) they both by the work of God, and from this Scripture observed
vvithall, how now the Lord took out of them a people for his name, as the
Prophets had foretold. ver. 14 -- 17. And besides the things spoken of David's
tabernacle in both places, note also, how where Amos has, that the Jews
should possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, upon whom the
name of the Lord is called, the Apostle James (follovving the Septuagints
translation) has it, that the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and
all the Gentiles, etc. so teaching, that by the remnant of Edom, we may
understand the residue of men besides the Jews, (whether nearer unto them, or
hostile against them, as the Edomites were to the Jews:) and that when the
Gentiles seek after the Lord, and are called by his name, then Obad. v. 19, 20,
21. Psa. 47 3, 4, 9.
they become the Jews possession in Christ, the son of David, in whom
David's ruinated tabernacle is built again, and the breaches of the hedges
thereof (vvherevvith it was compast about and fenced) be hedged and closed up,
and his ruins raised up, and it built and set up, as in the days of old, etc.
Amos 9, 11, 12. with Act. 15, 16, 17. To the same purpose may be observed
those many places throughout the Scripture, where it is said, that Christ
should sit upon the throne of David. Luke 1, 31, 32, 33. and Act. 2, 30. with
Psalm. 89, 3, 4, 29, 36. and 132, 11. Esa. 16, 5. and 32, 1. Jer. 33, 15 -- 26.
Dan. 7, 14, 27. Mic. 4, 7. Which being rightly understood, and spiritually
applied, will not only minister unto us much instruction and comfort, but
will also plainly manifest, how we should now still have reference hereunto,
in the churches estate, and in the many questions and controversies arising
thereabout. Briefly, these things and an hundred the like in the Scriptures,
sufficiently teach us, that although we be freed from Moses ceremonies, yet
we may not be aliens from Isreal's policy. As the Apostles also taught and
showed the churches continually. Ephesians. 2, 11, 12. with Gal. 5, 1 -- 13. Phil.
3, 2, 3. and Col. 2, 8 -- 17. and the whole Epistle to the Hebrews. 1 Pet.
2, 5 -- 10. 2 Pet. 1, 19, 20, 21. Rev. 19, 10. and 21, 2. etc.

4. So then (still remembering, as I noted erevvhile, that the ceremonies of
Moses are in such sort abrogated, and we freed from the outvvard observation
thereof according to the letter of the Law, as yet still the spirit and
equity thereof abides, and we stand bound to the observation thereof
accordingly: notvvithstanding the many differences of estate and
administration, betvveen them and us:) I come now to the Apostles vvritings, to
give some instances also out of them. To name some particulars therefore (to
which there is reference in the new Testament) as the Tabernacle, and Temple;
the Arc, and Mercy seat; the pillars, the candlestick; the Altar of burnt
offering, and incense; the Passover, and continual sacrifices, and offerings;
the Priests, and their ministration and service; the feasts; leven; leprosy;
uncleannes by touching the dead, etc. Who knovveth not, that these now are
ceased, and that many great differences may be observed hereabout, betvveen
them and us, betvveen their infancy and our riper age, betvveene their
administration and ours, etc. Yet notvvithstanding there is also the spiritual
intendement and use of these, besides the letter, and a perpetual equity of
them: which remains now still for ever: And accordingly do the Apostles,
and all vvriters, both old and new, from hence dravv reasons, informations,
and applications of them unto us, and our estate now under the Gospel. As ^^r
example may be seen, touching the tabernacle, and temple, how it is ^^plyed to
Christ, Ioh. 1, 14. (in the Original) and 2, 19, 21. Hebr. 8.1, 2. and 9, ^^,
12, 23, 24. Revel. 21, 22. And to the church, in the time of the Gospel, ^oth
the universal, and particular churches, Act. 15, 16, 17. Ephesians. 2, 21. ^ Cor.
3, 16, 17. 2 Cor. 6, 16. 2 These. 2, 4. 1 Pet. 2, 5. Revel. 3, 12. and 11, 1, 2,
19. and 13, 6. and 14, 15, 17. and 15, 5, 6, 8. and 21, 3. and to particular
persons, ^ Cor. 6, 19. 2 Cor. 5, 1 -- 4.2 Pet. 1, 13, 14. with Ioh. 2, 19, 22.
The like may be observed about the other particulars, with the several uses
and applica^ions made thereof in sundry places: as of the Arc, and
Mercie-seat, Rev. ^1, 19. and Romans 3, 25. with Exodus 25, 17 -- 21. in the
Septuagint. The pillars, Rev. ^, 12. Gal. 2, 9. 1 Timothy 3, 15. The Golden
candlesticks, Rev. 1, 12, 13, 20. and 2, ^, 5. and 11, 4. The Altar of burnt
offering, Mat. 5, 23, 24, 25. 1 Cor. 9, 13, 14. and ^0, 16, 17, 18. Hebr. 13,
10. Rev. 6,9. and 11, 1. and 14, 18. and the Altar of inc^nse, Rev. 8, 3, 4, 5.
and 9, 13. and 14, 18. The Passover, 1 Cor. 5, 7. with Joh. ^, 29. 1 Pet. 1,
19. Revel. 13, 8. and other sacrifices and offerings, Mark 9, 49. Ioh. 1, 29,
36. Romans 12, 1. and 15, 16. Phil. 2, 17. and 4, 18. Hebr. 9, 23, 26. and 10,
^2, 26. and 13, 15, 16. 1 Pet. 2, 5. The Priests, and their ministration and
service, Romans 15, 16. 1 Cor. 9, 13, 14. Hebr. 5, 1 -- 5. and 8, 1 -- 5. and 10,
12, 21. 1 Pet. ^, 5, 9. Rev. 1, 6. and 5, 10. and 20, 6. The feasts, 1 Cor. 5,
8. Jude ver. 12. Leven, Matthew. 16, 11, 12. Mar. 8, 15. Luke 12, 1. and 13, 21.
1 Cor. 5, 6, 7, 8. Gal. 5, 9. Leprosy, and other uncleannes, 1 Cor. 7, 14. 2
Cor. 6, 17. Ephesians. 5, 5. Jude ver. 23. Revel. 3, 4. and 16, 13. and 18, 2. Now
if from these we may derive reasons and applications to our selves, why not
also from circumcision, notvvithstanding the differences betvveen them and us:
as we see the Apostle also does in this particular likewise, Col. 2, 11, 12.
And in deed, what is there at all, in Moses or the Prophets, from which we
may not now deduce reasons, and receive information to our selves, for the
Churches use and benefit continually: seeing all the Scripture is given by
inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the Man of God may be
perfect, and thoroughly furnished unto all good works: 2 Timothy 3, 16, 17. with
Romans 15, 4. ^ Cor. 10, 1 -- 11. 2 Pet. 1, 19, 20.21. and Luke 16, 29, 30, 31.

5. Now to come more particularly to the objections here made concerning
circumcision: we are to observe, that when the Lord appointed ^he males only
to be circumcised, then was the man-child to come of the seed of Abraham, in
whom all the nations should be blessed. Genesis 17, 10. with ^2, 3. and 18, 18.
and 22, 18. Act. 3, 25. So as this ordinance (of circumcising ^he males only)
was then of exceeding good and great use, for the better direction, and more
confirmation of their faith in Christ. Like as also was, the appoynting of a
male Lamb, for the Passover. Exodus 12, 5. and ^he consecration of the first
borne of the males to the Lord, Exodus 13, 12. and Luke 2.23. both which were
types leading unto Christ. Joh. 1, 29, 36. ^ Cor. 5, 7. 1 Pet. 1, 19. and Romans
8, 29. But now that Christ is come of the ^eed of Abraham according to the
flesh, and has wrought for us eter^al redemption through the blood of his
cross, accomplishing the truth of those things which were shadowed by the
ceremonies of the law: this difference of sex and estate is taken away, so as
now there is neither male nor female, Jew nor Gentile, bond nor free, but we
are al one in Christ Jesus. Gal 3, 28. And so now the female is baptized, as
well as the male: and included (though not particularly by name expressed) in
the commission of Christ. Matthew. 28, 18, 19, 20. with Act. 16, 14, 15, 33.
Which is also against the Anabaptists: inasmuch as the ministration of the
outward sign of Gods covenant, is now (since Christ's coming) enlarged: women
being made partakers thereof, which before were not. And so the Anabaptists
error and sin is the greater, that would now straiten the extent of Gods
grace in Christ, denying the sign of Gods covenant to children, whom the Lord
appointed before to be partakers thereof. Genesis 17, 7 -- 13. Yea and even
touching the women heretofore (to note it here, by this occasion) though they
were not circumcised in their own persons, yet were they counted among the
circumcised of Israel: as may appear by the speech of Jacobs sons to
Shechem and Hamor, when they said, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister
to one that is uncircumcised: for that were a reproach unto us. etc. Genesis 34,
14. And by the saying of Samsons father and mother unto him, Is there never a
woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou
go to take a wife of the uncircumcised I hilistines? Zac. 13, 1.
Judge. 14, 3. And yet more particularly by the offering of purification: which
was as well upon the birth of a daughter, as of a son. Levit. 12, 6. and in
that there were cleansings, sacrifices for sin and uncleannes, as well for
women, as for men. Numb. 5, 2, 3, 6, 8, 15. and 15, 27. with Lev. 4, 27, 28.
and 5 chap. and 6, 2 -- 6. and 13, and 14, chap. and 15, 2, 14, 19, 29. and 16,
6, 17, 33, 34. And in that they might eat of the Passover: whereof no
uncircumcised person might eat. Luke 2, 41 -- 51. with Exodus 12, 3, 4, 48.

6. And touching the eight day, which was then set for circumcision: first
observe in general, that as it was the circumstance of time appointed
thereunto, so also the Lord ordained that they should keep the Passover but
once a year, the fourteenth day of the first month. Exodus 12, 6, 14. Number. 9,
1, 2, 3. Deu. 16, 1. Yet who would gather thereupon, that we should either
celebrate the Lords Supper but once a year, and that on the fourteenth day of
the first month, or that we should leave it altogether, seeing it is
answerable to the Passover had in Israel, which now is ceased? yet such
objections make the Anabaptists, when we reason from circumcision to
baptism. But now besides this, observe in particular, how it was also
ceremonial, that the child should remain seven days uncircumcised: which was
so many days as the mother should be unclean upon the birth of a man child:
(so teaching and figuring out the original corruption drawn from our
parents:) and that then the circumcision should be the eight day: which was
the first day after the seven aforesaid, and so soon as could be after them:
thus moreover teaching both the taking away of our uncleannes by the Spirit of
God, through the blood of Christ, whereunto circumcision then did lead; and
having also this morality in it, that we should not defer the time, but so
soon as we can ^^nveniently should bring our children, to be partakers of the
outward ^^ne of Gods covenant in Christ, Lev. 12, 2, 3. with 15, 19. And so
this circumstance of the time, is plain against the Anabaptists opinion and
practice. Besides that still once in eight days, a Sabbath would pass over
them: which was also a sign of sanctification in Israel. Exodus 31, 13. Ezech.
^^, 12. And that they had many like ceremonial observances about the eight
day; concerning things to be sacrificed, or persons to be cleansed, or
consecrated to the Lord: as may be seen, for things to be offered, Exodus ^^,
29, 30. with Lev. 22, 27. Also for persons to be cleansed, Lev. 14, 8, 9, 10,
23. and 15, 14, 29. Numb. 6, 10. and consecrated, Lev. 9, 1. with 8, 33, 35.
Eze. 43, 27. And yet note this also hereabout, that as the eight day was not to
be prevented, but to be expected, for diverse respects: so when it was upon just
occasion omitted, then it might be had at other times afterward: still taking
the first seasonable and convenient time thereunto. As (besides the like to be
observed about the Passover, Numb. 9, 1 -- 11.) may be seen touching
circumcision it self, in the practice of Israel, when it was omitted many
years in the wilderness, by reason of their journeyes. Josh. 5, 2 -- 7. And in
the example of Abraham's circumcision, and his households, Genesis 17, 24 -- 27.
and the proselytes of the Gentiles, for themselves, and their children. Exodus
^2, 48. Which also is against the Anabaptists in this behalf.

7. Of Isreal's infancy under the shadows of the law before the coming of
Christ; and of the abolition of those ceremonies by Christ; and s^ of the
difference between their estate and ours; I have spoken here before, that which
may suffice thereabout. Yet for the more clearing thereof, note this withal,
out of the Apostles speech to the Galatians, which is much urged by the
Anabaptists, and others: Gal. 3, and 4, and 5, ^^^p. that the Jews, before
Christ came, were kept under the ceremonies, as under a garrison, Gal. 3, 23.
as under a Schoolmaster, v. 24, 25. and a^ under Tutors and governors, Galat.
4, 1, 2, 3. And in this respect are counted as children under years, and in
bondage. Not but that they had the Gospel and everlasting covenant of Gods
grace, with faith and freedom of conscience in Christ: and were by him
delivered from Satan, sin, and condemnation, and made the inheritors of
eternal life, as well as we now. Gal. 3, 8, 17. with Genesis 12, 3, and 17, 7.
Ioh. 8, 56. Psa. 110, 1. and 116, (...) with 2 Cor. 4, 13. Hab. 2, 4 with Romans
1, 1, 2, 17. and 16, 25, 26. Hebr. 10, 38. Act. 15, 11. Ephesians. 3, 6. Heb. 4, 2.
and 11, chap. and 13, 20. But they were then bound to bear the yoke of many
toylesome and chargeable ceremonies: Which yoke is now taken away by the
coming of Christ: whom those ceremonies did shadow out, and in whom the
truth, body, and substance (...) them is had. Joh. 1, 16, 17. Act. 15, 10, 11.
Gal 3, 8 -- 17 -- 29. Colos. 2, 16, 17. ^^br. 8, and 9, and 10, and 11, and 12
chap. And in that respect now is this the ^^^rches riper age, wherein we have
freedom in Christ Gal. 3, and 4, and 5, (...). Which I note the rather,
because the Anabaptists and others, mista^^^g or perverting these things, and
so laboring (what they can) to darken or oppugn the truth, do under a vayn
pretense of Isreal's infancy, make frivolous exceptions and answers, when they
are pressed with reasons and arguments out of Moses and the Prophets. Observe
also, that whereas the Apostle often speaks of faith, in the place aforesaid
(which also is much urged by the Anabaptists) faith is there opposed to the
ceremonies and works of the law. Gal. 3, and 4 chap. Which is well to be
minded, that so we may know the Apostles meaning aright: who has no purpose
at all (as they would have it) thereby to exclude young children from the
covenant of God, or seal thereof: (as the whole scope of the place does
plainly manifest) but indeed to exclude the ceremonies and works of the law,
in the case of our justification and salvation by Christ; and to show how we
are freed from that yoke and bondage, under which the Jews were in the time
of the law, which now is abrogated and taken away by Christ. For otherwise the
Apostles themselves draw reasons from them, and make applications thereof unto
us: so teaching that the truth and equity of them is perpetual notwithstanding
as I have here before showed in many particulars.

OBJECTION VI.
But the Jews that were under the covenant, and circumcised when they were
young, were also baptized when they were old: And the Proselytes likewise of
the Gentiles. Matthew. 3, 5, 6. Act. 2, 5, 10, 41. and 18, 8.

ANSWER.
1. Circumcision, besides that it was a seal of the covenant of God, was also
(in other respect) one of the shadows and ceremonies of the law, and so
(according to the time of the old Testament) was done with blood, and led them
still on to the Messiah to come, who was not then exhibited. Lev. 12, 2, 3.
with Exodus 4, 26. Whereas Baptism (agreably to the manner of the new Testament)
is without blood, and seals unto us the grace of God in Christ, who is now
come in the flesh. Ioh. 1, 26, 27, 29. Act. 2, 36, 38, 41. and 8, 36, 37. In
which respect it was needful that the Jews and Proselytes (though
circumcised) should also be baptized into the name of Jesus Christ: and so
should manifest that now they looked no longer (as before) for the Messiah to
come, but believed in him that was already come, even in Jesus Christ, in whom
the shadows of the law had their end and fulness, and in whom the promises of
God are Yea and Amen, to the glory of God by us. So as now both Jews and
Gentiles are compleet in Jesus Christ: and therefore were baptized into his
name Col. 2, 10 -- 12, 16, 17. with 2 Cor. 1, 20. and 12, 13. Act. 2, 38, 41.
and 8, 36, 37. and 10, 36 -- 48.

2. There were also many both Jews and Proselytes, who though they were
circumcised, yet did not acknowledge Christ now exhibited Luke 7, 29, 30. Act.
2, 40. and 6, 12, 13, 14. and 7 chap. and 13, 45 -- 50. and 14, 2 -- 5. and 17,
4, 5. and 18, 4, 5, 6. and 19, 8, 9. and 28, 17, 23, 24. Romans 2, 17 -- 29. Rev.
2, 9. and 3, 9. In respect whereof, it was needful that such of them as
believed (...) christ, should accordingly profess it and so by baptism be
distingui^^^d and separated from the other unbeleeving Jews and Proselytes,
(...) refused Jesus Christ, and yet still gloried in their circumcision.
Where^n moreover the Apostles exhorted the believing Jews and Proselytes, to
save themselves from that untovvard generation. And then they that gladly
received the word, were baptized. Act. 2, 40, 41. and 18, 4 -- 8. (...).
Moreover, as there is one body, which has one baptism appointed unto it by
the Lord, both for Jews and Gentiles, and the partition wall broken down
by Jesus Christ, who has made both one in himself: so was it needful
likewise in this respect, that the Jews should be partakers of the same
baptism with the Gentiles: and so both of them by one spirit to be baptized
into one body, whereof Christ is the head: having one hope of their calling,
one Lord, one faith, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through
all, and in us all. 1 Cor. 12, 12, 13. with Ephesians. 2.13, 14, 15. and 3, 6. and
4, 4, 5, 6, 15, 16. Whereupon also it follovveth, that seeing the Gentiles are
now of the same body with the Jews, and joynt-partakers of the same promise
in Christ, by the Gospel: that therefore the children of the Gentiles must now
in Christ be partakers of the seal of his grace, as well as the children of
the Jews were heretofore. Ephesians. 3, 6. with Genesis 17, 7 -- 13. and 21, 4.
Zach. 2, 11. and 13, 1. Act. 2, 39. and 3, 25.

OBJECTION VII.
But Christ himself was not baptized, till he was thirty years old. Luke 3.
21, 22, 23.

ANSWER.
1. Yet he was circumcized, when he was but eight days old. Luke 2, 31. Which
comes al to one end, for the point in hand: seeing circumcision was the seal
of Gods covenant, like as baptism is; and seeing baptism now is come in stead
thereof; as I have shevved here before.

2, Secondly, their reason is much like, as if they should say thus: Abraham
the father of the faithful was not circumcized, till he was ninety and nine
years old, Genesis 17, 1 -- 24. therefore none then should have been circumcized,
till they were of years, as Abraham was, nor till they did believe, and could
understand the doctrine and promise of God, as Abraham did. Genes. 15, 5, 6,
etc. and 17, 1, 2, etc. with Romans 4, 11, etc. If they say, that Abraham in his
infancy could not be circumcized, because circum^^sion was not then instituted
or used; but that when once it was instituted, he took it as soon as he could:
let them also observe the same touching Christ, that the ordinance of baptism,
for the time of the Gospel now coming on, was not yet instituted or
administered by John the Baptist, when Christ was young: and that John the
Baptist (the forerunner of Christ, whom God sent to baptize) being but half a
year elder then Christ himself, it could not therefore be that Christ should
then be ba^tized of him in his childhood: Luke 1, 5, 13, 24, 26, 27, 31, 36,
41. But when John the Baptist had begun his ministration, then Christ came
unto him, to be baptized of him. Luke 3, 1 -- 21. with Matthew. 3, 1 -- 13. Mark
1, 1 -- 9. (...) thus the example of Christ, being well observed, is against
themselves also the example of Abraham; teaching us, that as soon as
convenient can be, we should be made partakers of baptism, as Abraham was of
circumcision, and Christ of baptism by the ministration of John the Baptist.

3. Otherwise if they will urge the example of Christ in every thing (for a
rule to be followed of us) without consideration of the special reasons and
respects to be had concerning him: why then are they not circumcized, as Christ
also was? Luke 2, 21. why are they baptized before or after they be thirty
years old, seeing Christ was baptized at that age? Luke 3, 21, 23, Why have
they not the heavens to open, and the holy Ghost visibly to descend upon them,
etc. as Christ had at his baptism? Luke 3, 21, 22. Matt. 3, 16, 17. And why
do they not, upon their baptism received, fast forty days and forty
nights, as Christ did after he was baptized? Luk 4, 1, 2. Matthew. 4, 1, 2. If
they answer, that these and the like things concerning Christ had their
special reasons and respects in him, either in regard of his person, or of his
office and ministration, or the estate of the Church at that time, and the
like: and that therefore they are not general rules to bind all others
thereunto: then they answer their own objection themselves, and thus let all
men see that the objection is not of weight, for the point of the question in
hand. Or if they will not thus answer, but vvil make these things be general
rules for all to follow, why do they not then so walk themselves, and why are
not these things had and observed among them? The like also may be noted about
such actions and estate of others in the Scripture, as have their special
reasons and respects, differing from the general rule and course prescribed
otherwise. Which being duly observed, will much lay open the vanity of many
objections made to the contrary, in this behalf.

4. And finally observe herein the strange dealing of the Anabaptists, that
urge the example of Christ in such actions, as had their special reasons and
peculiar respects, as is aforesaid: and yet will not regard Christ's example in
such actions, as he did upon general and perpetual grounds, binding all
thereunto. As namely, that when little children were brought unto Christ, he
took them up in his arms, and laid his hands upon them and blessed them: and
that upon this ground, because of such is the kingdom of heaven. Mar 10, 13,
14, 16. Where also note well these two things vvithall: first: that they were
little children, Matt. 19, 13. Mar. 10, 13. whom also Luke calls infants,
Luke 18, 15. Which appears the more, in that they were brought and offered to
Christ by others, Matt. 19, 13. Mar. 10, 13. Luke 18, 15. and such as Christ
did take up in his arms, Mar. 10, 16. Secondly, that by Christ's own
testimony and practice here, little children are partakers of his spiritual
graces, and of the outvvard signs and declarations thereof. Of his spiritual
graces, as namely, of his blessing, and the kingdom of heaven. Of outward
signs and testimonies thereof, as the imposition of Christ's hands upon them,
Mar. 10, 13, 14, 16. Yet these actions of Christ, that were thus done (...) a
general and perpetual ground, warranting also the baptism of ^^^^dren, the
Anabaptists pass over and contradict in their opinions and ^^^tise: and
notvvithstanding cease not to urge other actions that were ^^^e upon special
reasons and respects, as was showed here before. Now (...), is this to
understand and use the Scripture aright? Is this the way to ^^^ow the example
of Christ aright? Or is it not in deed to incur the ^leasure and rebuke of
Christ, as the disciples did, who then would not ^^e little Children to be
brought unto Christ; as now the Anaba^^^^s would not have them to be baptized
into his name? Mar. 10, 13, 14.

OBJECTION VIII.
But children understand not the mystery of baptism.

ANSWER.
As much as they did the mystery of Circumcision: whereof notwithstanding
they were partakers. Genesis 17, 12. and 21, 4. Exo. 12, 48, 49. Act. 7, 8. (...).
Neither could little children and infants understand the mystery of the
kingdom of God, or of Christ's blessing of them: whereof they were partakers
notvvithstanding. Mar. 10, 13 -- 16.

2. Neither did Peter understadd the mystery of Christ's washing his feet:
when notwithstanding he was made partaker thereof Ioh. 13, 6, 7. etc. (...).
The Anabaptists themselves understand not aright the mystery of ^^^tisme (as
may appear by their opinions and practice.) By their own ^^^son then, they
are not rightly partakers thereof. Which let them carefully lay to heart.

3. Finally the ground of baptism (like as of circumcision) is not our
understanding, faith, and obedience, as the Anabaptists hold: (which were
^^^eak and unperfit ground) but the everlasting covenant of God in Christ, and
his gracious acceptance of us thereinto, whether Jews or Gentiles, (...) or
young, etc. (as I have here before declared at large:) Which is a (...) and
certain ground: and such as gives the glory to the grace of God, and not to
the work of man: neither establishes man's righteous^^^^ ^^at all, but only
the righteousness of God in Christ, to the praise of ^^^riches of his grace,
throughout all generations for ever.

4. and hitherto of the baptism of infants, that are the children of the
^^^^hfull. Of which point, and of sundry objections thereabout, I have ^^^ted
the more largely: considering how great the error is in the de^^^^ thereof;
and how greatly it spreads both in these parts, and (of (...)) in our own
country.

CHAPTER II. Touching Original sin in Children.
^He Anabaptists do not only deny Baptism to children, but are (...) driven
vvithall (for the more strengthening of their error therein) to deny that
children have original sin, or that it is damnable in the^^ Which is also
another notable error, contrary to the Scripture and wor^^^ of God.

1. Because the Scriptures teach, that man being made at the first, in the
image and likeness of God, that is, in holiness and righteousness of truth Genesis
1, 26, 27. with Eccles. 7, 29. and Ephesians. 4, 24. Col. 3, 10. became sinful an^
corrupt by his fall and transgression: Genesis 3, 1 -- 7. with Romans 3, 23. and 5,
1^ 18, 19. so as afterward he begat his children in his own likeness,
afte^ his own image, that is, unholy and unrighteous, defiled with iniquity
and subject to wrath. Genesis 5, 3. with Psalm. 51, 5. 1 Cor. 15, 49. Ephesians. 2, 3.
An^ here Moses speech, using the term of begetting, and of Adams begetting
son in his own likeness, is well to be observed: as plainly shevving,
th^^ we are corrupted and sinful from our very birth and generation, and th^^
also ever since the fall and transgression of Adam. Genesis 5, 3. Besides th^^ we
were then in the loins of our first parents, and so in them also vv^ have all
sinned, Romans 5, 12, 19. To which purpose, the Apostles speech i^ another case
may be observed, where he says, that Levi paid tithes i^ Abraham, because he
was in the loins of Abraham his father vvhe^^ Melchisedec met him: though
he was not borne yet some generation after that time, Hebr. 7, 9, 10.

2. Moreover the Lords appointing of circumcision to be had in the in fancy;
and in the foreskin of the flesh, in the part of generation; and tha^ also with
blood: teaches likewise, that children are defiled with sin even from the
birth, being conceived and borne with iniquity; and ha^^ need to be cleansed
therefrom by the blood of Christ. Genesis 17, 11, 12. Exo. 4, 25, 26. Lev. 12, 2,
3, 4. with Psalm. 51, 5. Ezech. 16, 6. with Joh. 1, 29. and 1 Ioh. 1, The same
is taught and employed, by the purification of women in Israe^ after
childbirth. Lev. 12 chap. Whereabout note vvithall, that Mark well the words,
how upon conceiving seed, and bringing forth a child, God said, She shall be
unclean.
if a vvoma^ conceived seed, and bare a man-child (who was to be circumcized
i^ his own person) the woman was unclean seven days, and was to co^tinevv
in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days, Lev. 12, 2, 3. But if she
bare a mayd-child, (who was not to be circumcised in he^ own person, but
included in the males) then the time of her uncleanne and purification was
doubled, she was uncleaue two vveeks, and was continue in the blood of her
purifying threescore and six days. ver. And after those days fulfilled
(whether it were a son, or a daughte^ she was to bring to the Priest, a
lamb and a pigeon, or two turtle doue^ for a burnt offering, and a sin
offering. ver. 6, 7, 8. Which shadows sign^fied, both the corruption of nature
from the womb, and our redemption by grace through the mercy of God in Christ.

If any object, that Christ himself was circumcised, who yet was without
sin: and that Mary the Mother of Christ conceiving by the ove^ shadovving of
the holy Ghost, and so not defiled by his birth, yet kept also the law of
purification after childbirth: we are to observe, that the^ were diverse
reasons of using these ceremonies of the law, besides the ^^^nifications
aforesaid, and other the like. As namely this also for one, (...) for obedience
of the law of God, who gave them to his people. And (...) this respect, both
Christ himself Gal. 4, 4.
being borne of a woman under the ^avv, and his mother being her self an
Israelite, they were both of them ^ound to keep these laws of God, which
were given unto Israel: and ^^uen also generally, so as in the one there was
no exception of any male child that was eight days old, nor in the other of
any woman, that ^rought forth children. Genesis 17, 12. and Lev. 12 chap. And
this very reason of the observation of the law of God therein) is in some
particulars expressed by the Evangelist himself, Luke 2, 21 -- 24. Besides that
otherwise the like objection might be made touching Christ's baptism; which
he also received (not for that he was himself defiled with sin, and needed
to be cleansed therefrom, but) because he would thus fulfill all righteousness:
as he did himself shevve to John the Baptist, whenas John made exception
thereabout, considering his person and estate. Matt. 3, 13, 14, 15.

3. But to proceed with the point in hand, David a Prophet and man of God
expressly professes of himself, that he was brought forth in iniquity, and
that in sin his mother conceived him. Psalm. 51, 5. Which is also the more to
^e minded, because in another Psalm he styleth himself the son of Gods
handmaid, being an Israelite, borne of believing parents, under the covenant of
grace: Psalm. 86, 16. and yet so acknowledges his natural corruption, as is
aforesaid. And the argument of the Psame does yet the more confirm it, in
that speaking there, of actual sins, and particularly of his adultery with
Bathsheba, he notes the fountain thereof to have been the original corruption
that was in him, defiling the whole man. Psalm. 51, 4. compared with the title
of the Psalm, and ver. 1, 2, etc. Thus teaching us (by his example) alvvay to
look, not at our actual sins alone, but at our natural corruption also, as
being the bitter fountain and original thereof: that so we may aright
discern and acknowledge how corrupt and sinful we are: and be truly humbled in
our selves, and give glory to God in all his judging of us. ver. 3, 4, 5. Which
else we do not attain unto aright, as we should. Whereupon in the next verse
after, he calls it wisdom, to know this corruption of our nature, and to
acknovvledge it, and be truly humbled thereby and cast down in our selves
before God. Psalm. 51, 6.

4. And the Apostle Paul teaches the same, when he says that al, even the
Jews as well as the Gentiles, are by nature the children of wrath. Ephesians. ^, 3.
He says not (by imitation) as some would color it, for more confirmation of
their error: but by nature (says he) are we all the children of wrath: that we
may know this is natural and from the birth. Whereupon again otherwhere he
calls our natural corruption, the old man; and the law of sin that is in
our members; and the sin that dwells in us; and so easily and rea^^ly
besettes us about, hanging fast upon us; also, the body of sin; the body of
^^ath, etc. Romans 6, 6. and 7, 17, 23, 24. Hebr. 12, 1.

5. And Christ himself also teaches, that that which is borne of the flesh, is
^^sh. Ioh. 3, 6. And Job says, Who can bring a clean thing out of an
unclean? Not one Job 14, 4. Either therefore they must say that children are
not borne of the flesh, nor that their parents by nature are unclean: or else
they must grant children also to be flesh, and unclean, by natural generation.

6. Neither else should Christ only be exempt from sin, being conceived of
the Virgin, by the overshadowing of the holy Ghost. Luke 1, 31.35. with Hebr.
4, 15. and 7.26. For by their opinion, all children should be borne without
sin, as well as Christ. And what privilege then had Christ by his birth
after that sort? What then needed it in this behalf, that Christ should be
borne of a virgin, and conceived by the holy Ghost coming upon her, and the
power of the most high overshadowing her? And why are these things so specially
noted, and were so done, concerning Christ, to free him from sin, and to
exempt him from all others: if their opinion were true, that children are not
corrupted with original sin?

7. How also then is it true, which the Scripture so often teaches, that all
have sinned, and come short of the glory of God? Romans 3, 23. that the
Imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth. Genesis 8, 21. that we are not
sufficient of our selves to think any thing as of our selves. 2 Cor. 3, 5.
that we are dead in trespasses and sins. Ephesians. 2, 1. that we are ensnared,
and taken captive by the Devil at his vvil. 2 Timothy 2, 26. and by nature walk
in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind:
Ephesians. 2, 3. whereupon moreover our corrupt inclinations, affections, and
actions (being fruits of our original corruption) are called the works of the
flesh. Gal. 5, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26. and our mouth, lips, tongues, throat,
eyes, hands, feet, and all our members are polluted with sin and iniquity.
Psalm. 5, 9. and 10, 7. and 14, 2, 3. Esa. 59 3 -- 8. Romans 3, 10 -- 18. And this
taught by the Apostle to be the case both of Jews, and Gentiles; that every
mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God. Romans 3, 9 --
19.

8. Finally, how is it that children dye, if they have no sin: seeing death
entered into the world by sin, and is the wages thereof? Romans 5, 12, 21. and
6, 23. And when God brought in the flood upon the world of the ungodly, and
none were saved but eight persons: shall we think there were no children in
the world, or that the death which came upon them by the flood, was no
punishment of sin? Genesis 6, and 7 chap. with 2 Pet. 2, 5. Likewise at the
destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, when God rayned fire and brimstone from
heaven, upon all in those cities. Genesis 19 chap. And at the conspiracy of Corah,
Dathan, and Abiram, when (besides the fire, which consumed the two hundred and
fifty men that offered incense the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and
covered the company of Abiram, their wives, their sons, their little children,
and all that appertayned unto them, Number. 16. chap. with Psalm. 106, 17, 18.
where there is mention of little children in particular, Numb. 16, 27. Like as
there is also, at the slaughter made in Jerusalem, for the abominations done in
the midst thereof. Ezec. 9, 1 -- 6. And to conclude, if children were not
through sin subject to death, yea and to eternal death and condemnation,
then should ^^ey need no Savior: and why then needed Christ (in respect of
them) ^^^take part with children of flesh and blood, that through death he
might destroy ^n that had the power of death, that is the Devil: as the
Apostle teaches. Heb. ^ 14. And thus much (by this occasion) touching
Original sin in children.

CHAPTER III. Wheher the Baptism that is received in the apostaticall Churches
of Christians, as in the Church of Rome, and the like, is to be renounced and a
new to be repeated again, or not.
ANother great error also it is, to think that the baptism had in the Church
of Rome, or other apostate Churches, is not to be regarded, but to be
renounced, and another to be received anew. Which opinion, vvhereupon soever
it arise (whether upon the denying of baptism to children which is used in
the Churches aforesaid; or upon other erroneous persuasions touching apostate
Churches, or the baptism thereof) certain it is, and evident by the
Scriptures, to be against the word and will of God, and therefore to be
sinful so to hold or practice.

I.
Which first may appear by this, that there is neither precept, not example,
nor other ground in all the Scriptures, either in the Old or New Testament,
for renouncing, repeating, new requiring or admitting thereof. And therefore
such persuasions and new baptismes are not from heaven, but of men. Contrary to
the baptism of John and the Apostles, which was from the Lord. Matt. 21, 25.
and 28, 18, 19, 20. Joh. 1, 25 -- 33. with Act. 15, 24. Gal. 5, 7, 8.

II.
Secondly, there is one Baptism, as there was one Circumcision. And Baptism
had in the apostate churches of Christians, is answerable to circumcision
retained in Isreal's apostasy. Now circumcision being once received in the
apostasy of Israel, was not repeated again at their returning to the Lord and
leaving of their idolatrous vvayes to serve him according to his word: but they
that were so circumcised, were (without any new circumcision of the flesh)
accepted at Jerusalem, and admitted to the Passover, of which none might eat
that was uncircumcised. In like manner also, Baptism being once received in the
apostaticall churches of Christians, is not to be repeated again when any so
baptized return unto the Lord, and forsake their idolatries, submitting
themselves to the truth of the Gospel: but they are (without any new baptizing
with water to be received of the Churches of Christ and admitted to the Lords
supper, whereof none may eat being unbaptized. For these examples of Israel,
as all other things in the Scriptures written aforetyme, are aforevvritten for
our instruction and comfort. Ephesians. 4, 5. with Genesis 17, 10 -- 13. Ez^ 12, 48, 49.
2 Chronicles. 30 chap. Jer. 9, 26. Hos. 1, 2. Ier. 50, 4, 5, 19, 20. and 51, 5. with
Ezech. 16 and 23 chap. Ezr. 6, 19, 20, 21. with Romans 15, 4.

III.
Also the covenant of Gods grace in Christ is Genesis 17, 7. Psa. 89, 30 -- 34.
and 106, 45. and 111, 5, 9. Gal. 3, 8, 29. Heb. 13, 8, 20. with Deuteronomy. 4, 30,
31. and 29, 10 -- 15. and 30 chap. Romans 11, 15, 16, 28, 29.
an everlasting covenant: into which it pleased God to take us with Abraham
our father, when he made that covenant with him and his seed for ever. And as
the Lord himself, who knows his works from the beginning, Judge. 2, 11. etc.
2 King. 13, 23. and 14, 27. 2 Chronicles. 15, 3, 4. and 30, 6, 7, 8, 9. Jer. 51, 5.

and 13, 4, 5. Col. 2, 10 -- 13. Rev. 18, 4.
has regard unto it in his merciful dealing concerning his people, in
apostaticall Churches and estate; so ought we also our selves carefully to have
respect thereunto, in the consideration of baptism thus received, as in all
other things, according to the word of God; and manifold occasions ministered
from the Lord.

IIII.
And seeing Christ dyed to sin once, and being raised from the dead, dies no
more, but lives to God: And we are buried with him by baptism into his
death, to be planted with him likewise to the similitude of his resurrection:
therefore also all that are once baptized into his name, ought still to retain
it for continual use and comfort, and not again to repeat it, any more then
there is repetition of Christ's death and sacrifice once offered to take away
sin. Romans 6, 8 -- 11. with ver. 3, 4, 5. and Act. 13, 34. Heb. 7, 27. and 9,
25 -- 29. and 10, 10 -- 14. 1 Pet. 3, 18. Revel. 1, 18. with Matthew. 28, 19, 20.

V.
And touching the Church of Rome in particular, it cannot be denied, but that
Church was espoused to Christ in the covenant of grace by the Gospel of
salvation, having baptism with the rest of Christ's ordinances, in the Apostles
days: and has ever since retained it with other grounds of Christian
religion, notwithstanding all her adulteries and apostasy whereinto she is
fallen. As may be seen both in that Church it self, and all other churches
which are the daughters thereof in their constitution, either for faith or
order, or both, in whole or in part. And hereunto (as in Iudahs and Isreal's
apostasies heretofore, so now) in all cases and questions of this nature, due
respect is alvvay to be had: As may appear by these Scriptures, Romans 7, 1, 8.
and 6, 3, 4. with Revel. 17 chap. and 18, 4. Genesis 17, 7 -- 14. with Jud. 2, 11,
12. etc. 1 King. 14, 22, 23, 24. 2 Kin. 21, and 24, and 25 chap. Psalm. 89, 30
-- 34. 2 King. 9, 6. and 13, 23. and 14, 27. Ier. 2 chapter Eze. 16, 2 -- 44 -- 60,

7, 9, 10.

VI.
They profess Jesus to be the Christ, and to be the son of God mani^^^^^^ in
the flesh, that dyed for the sins of the world, that by his sacri^^^^ and
death upon the cross has reconciled us unto God, and paid (...) ^ood as a
full and sufficient ransom for all our sins, Rhem. Annot. ^ Tim. 2, 5. and 1 John 2, 2. etc. They profess also the articles of the Chri^^^^^ faith,
contained in the Apostles Creed (as it is commonly called) and (...) the
Nicene, and Athanasius Creed. As appears also in the Rhemes Testament, (...)
their notes at the end of the Acts of the Apostles; and in their service book,
etc. (...) professing this faith, they baptize with water in the Name of the
Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost. Which Christ commanded his disciples to
do. Matthew. 28, 16, 19. with Act, 8, 36, 37. Therefore the Baptism received
among them, is not to be renounced, etc.

VII.
And who can deny (with any vvarrant from the word of God) the Jews and
Pagans, whom they bring to the faith of Christ aforesaid, and baptize into his
name: Who can (I say) with any good reason, deny these now to be Christians,
or not to have the Lords ordinance of baptism, which is still to be retained,
and not a new to be gotten or repeated again? Like as the strangers and
Proselytes of the Gentiles, that came to the faith of Israel in the time of
their apostasy, and so were circumcised, retained still their circumcision,
and were received in Judah to eat of the Passover, together with the
Israelites themselves: Whereof none might eat that were uncircumcised. 2 Chronicles.
30, 1 -- 11 -- 25. with Exodus 12, 48, 49.

VIII.
The Scripture also teaches, that God has Rev. 18, 4. (...) 2, 2. and 3, 1.
and 4, 1, 2, 12, 15, 16, 17. Mich. 1, 1 -- 5 -- 13. etc. Ier. 2, 2, etc. E^^^^.
16, 2 -- 60. and 20, 4 -- 44. and 22 and 23 chap.
his people in the Romish Babylon, under his covenant of grace: and when he
calls them out from thence, requires of them not to be partakers of their
sins: but requires not to leave whatsoever is had in the church of Rome. But
(as the Prophets taught and dealt with Israel of old) the children of that
church should plead with their mother, that she take away her fornications
out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts. Now Matt. 28,
19.
Baptism is not of her adulteries, but of Christ's ordinances; it is not a
threshold or post which Antichrist has brought into the Temple of God, but was
set therein Romans 6, 3, ^^^h 2 These. 2, 3, 4. and Rev. 11 chap.
of old by the Lord himself. Neither may we plead with the Church of Rome, to
take it away, but that she put away the fornications and corruptions that
are of her own addition. Which are the very things Ezech. 43, 7, 8, 9. and 16
chap. Judge. 2, (...) Psalm. 106, 35 -- 39. Esa. 8, 11, etc. Amos 5, 4, 5, 6, 14,
15. with Rev. 8, and 9, (...) and 13, 6, 17, and 14 chap. etc.
that cause the abomination of her estate, and which we are bound to leave
and put away, and not all whatsoever is had in such Apostaticall Churches.

IX.
Else by such like reasons as the baptism is renounced which is the received,
men might also urge (as some have done) not to reteyne, use^ regard as we
should, the articles of faith, the learning of the scripture^ the translations
thereof, had and acknowledged in those Church ^^ld (...) likewise might
persuade to the dissolution of such marriages as have b^^ had by their
Ministry: with other as strange consequences that by (...) manner of
reasoning would be inferred thereupon. Which to admit (...) were contrary
to Deuteronomy. 5, 32, 33. and 31, 9 -- 13. Prove. 4, 25, 26, 27. and 23, 2 Chro. 29,

OBJECTION I.
But The Anabaptists. M. A. etc Animad. p. 68 -- 72, 71 -- 75.
the Baptism had in the Church of Rome, is not true baptism, (...) an Idol,
and lying sign; a detestable and cursed sacrament; a fiction and (...) true
Christian baptism; M. Cl.
no better then when we wash our own face wi^^ water daily. Of which sort also
the Baptism of the Church of England (...) And Circumcision, that was kept in
the apostasy of Israel heretofore.

ANSWER.
Assertions notably erroneous (if not indeed heretical and blasph^mous) and
such as are not peculiar to the Anabaptists alone, but are so^^ of them
affirmed, and some of them also published by others: some saying one thing,
some another; some speaking of one church, some of another; some to one
purpose, some to another; sometimes more plainly directly, sometimes with
shifts and pretenses, more deceiving the simpl^ and bevvraying their own
iniquity. Which is the more lamentable, (...) as much as these being maine
grounds of Anabaptistrie, they shou^^ therefore be convinced and resisted, not
colored or pleaded for by as means. For if the former assertions were true,
then would it necessary follovv, that the Baptism received in the Churches
aforesaid, is not (...) ordinance of God, not to be retained, but utterly to be
rejected, and (...) baptism to be received, both for obedience of the
commandment (...) God, and for our own comfort.

Reasons showing, That if the Baptism of the Church of Rome and England were
an Idol and lying sign, etc. then it ought to be renounced, and another to be
receyved.
I. Because Idols and lying signs and fictions are not of God, but the Devil,
who is a liar, and a Father thereof. Ioh. 8, 44. Romans 3, 4.

II. Neither can an Idol and lying sign, or such a baptism as is more then a
daily washing of our own faces, be the sign and seale^ Gods true and
everlasting covenant, of the righteousness of faith, and ^^ashing away of our
sins in the blood of Christ. 2 Cor. 6, 14, 15, 16. ^^.2, 18. 1 Cor. 8, 4.
with Romans 4, 11. and 6, 3, 4.

III. The sign in a Sacrament also is that which is outward and visible. (...)
^h in Baptism, is the washing with water, in the Name of the Lord. (...) if
this be a fiction, and lying sign, in the Churches aforesaid, then is not the
Lords: And they which are there baptized, have not then the outvvard visible
sign, which the Lord has ordained to be had of his people: and therefore are
bound to get it unto them, where it may be ^ad Romans 4, 11. and 6, 3, 4. Act.
10, 47, 48. Matt. 3, 11. and 28, 18, 19. with Genesis 1^, 11, 12, 13. and 21, 4.

IV. And that also is to be done without delay, and before they may come to the
Lords Supper: seeing the neglect of Baptism is sin, as was the neglect of
circumcision: and no unbaptized person may eat of the Lords supper, as no
uncircumcised person might eat of the passover. Ephesians. 4, 4, 5. and Luke 7,
29, 30. with 1 Cor. 10, 16, 17, 18. Exo. 4, 24, 25, 26. and 12, 43, ^^, 48.

V. And if any that reteyne an Idol baptism, and lying sign and fiction, and
have not the Lords sign of the washing away of their sins in the blood of
Christ; will so presume to come to the Table of the Lord, they do highly
profane it, and eat judgment unto themselves. 2 Cor. 6, 14, 1^, 16. with 1
Cor. 11, 27, 28, 29. and Mal. 1, 7. 2 King. 23, 21. with ver. 4, etc. E^^ 16,
19, 20, 21. Esa. 44, 20. Zach. 10, 2.

VI. Yea, seeing Baptism is the badge of Christianity, will it not also
follovv hereupon, that such persons as have no other outward baptism, but an
Idol baptism, and lying sign and fiction, stand outwardly in this behalf
Idol and false Christians; and the Ministers among them, Idol and false
Ministers, profaning the holy things which they minister? And that therefore
the persons and ministers which so speak and write against the baptism of the
Churches aforesaid, and yet have no other outvvard baptism, but what they
received there, are accordingly to be esteemed themselves, until they revoke
their ungodly errors? And moreover, (...) none who have but an Idol baptism
and lying sign themselves, (...) such estate minister baptism or the Lords
supper to others, and be accepted or retained for the ministers of Christ,
without great sin and Impiety? 2 Cor. 6, 14, 15, 16. with 2 Chronicles. 29 and 30
chap. Ezra 2, 61, 62, (...) and 6, 19, 20, 21. Jer. 10, 8. Psalm. 115, 4 -- 8. 1
Cor. 10, 7, 14. Ioh. 5, 21. Rev. 21, 8. and ^2, 15. Zach. 10, 2. and 11, 17.
Ezech. 44, 6, 7, 8, 9.

VII. Neither can it be thought, that repentance (which still they speak of)
should ever make a lie to be a truth; an Idol to be Gods ordinance; a lying
and cursed sign to be a true and blessed sacrament. For ^^^^gh repentance
fyndeth mercy with God for a lie, yet a lie is a lie (...) and an Idol
vanity. Zach. 10, 2. Ier. 10, 8. Ioh. 8, 44. and 14, 6. and 17. (...) with 2
Cor. 6, 14, 15, 16.

VIII. Nor do they indeed repent, who still reteyne such baptism, (...)
themselves think to be an Idol, and lying sign and fiction. For true
repentance, and our duty to God, leads and byndeth us to cast away all
Idols, and lying signs and fictions far from us. Hos. 14, 8. Ezeck. 2^ Esa.
30, 22. and 44, 20. 1 Cor. 10, 14. 1 John 5, 21. with Rev. 2, 20, 21, 22. and
9, 20. 14, 9 -- 12. And this also (as I noted before) is religiously to be
done, afo^^ ever we offer to come to the Lords supper: as they in Israel
careful purged the Temple that had been defiled, and brake down the Idols at
idolatrous monuments, before they would celebrate the Passover. 2 Chr 29 and 30
chap. 2 King. 23, 3 -- 23. with 2 Chronicles. 34 and 35 chap.

IX. Whereas therefore they say, Animad. p. 70.
We have gotten the Lords Baptism coming to the Lord, in true faith and
repentance, who baptizeth us with the h^^ Ghost and with fire. As for the
outvvard washing which we had, it need not be^^ peated: etc. And afterward
say, page 72.
We have renounced that Romish Baptism, as^ impure idol in their abuse, etc.
they do but shift and contradict themselue^ and deceive others, and still
run into errors (one after another) mo^^ and more.

For, 1. speaking of the Lords baptism, they speak of that which inward,
whereas our question is of that which is outvvard.

2. They speak of abuses in the ministration and opinions of the Min^sters
thereof, whereas our question is of the thing it self, not of the abus^

3. Their assertion implies, that they had not the Lords baptism, till t^^
got it themselves by coming to the Lord in true faith and repentance. Which
plain Anabaptistrie, and covert Popery, and Arminianisme. Where^^ they debase
Gods grace, and exalt man's works. For when they say, the have gotten the Lords
baptism by true faith and repentance, it must be understoo^ either of the
inward, or outward Baptism. If of the inward, besides the it touches not the
question (as is aforesaid) it implies Popery: if of t^^ outvvard, it
conteyneth Anabaptistry.

4. And that moreover so, as if they had dyed themselves in their i^fancie,
they had not then had the Lords baptism, nor had been baptiz^ with the Holy
Ghost: And as not themselves, so neither any other i^fants there baptized.

5. No nor when they were come to years, if they had dyed, before the had left
to be members of the church of Rome and England. For some of them left the one,
some the other, and all of them have left both. A^^ holding them Animad. p.
68.70. 72. 75. 82. 93. 96. ^ustis. page 121, 278, 463.
not to be under the covenant of God, nor to have t^^ Lords baptism for a
sign unto them of his covenant, and a seal of t^^ righteousness of faith in
Jesus Christ: but that he has broken the cov^nant even on his part also, and
has given them a bill of divorce, and p^^^ them away, etc. it will follow,
that they suppose they did then come the Lord in true faith and repentance, and
(as some of them speak it) did the enter into the covenant of God, when they
left that estate, and came to the cause which now they profess. And so either
they have no outward b^ptisme at all (according to their own opinion)
confirming the covena^^ of God, and the righteousness of faith unto them in
Christ: or else the^ had it, before they came under the Lords covenant, and in a
Church ^^^^ced from the Lord. Let them choose, which they will: and show how
^^r own estate can be warranted by the word of God: and how their ^^nions
and courses agree with the doctrine of the Scriptures, concer^^^g the covenant
of God; and the eternity thereof; the sacrament of baptism, and the
ministration thereof; the mediation of Christ, and the ^^nt thereof; both for
confirmation of the covenant, and comfort of the Sacraments, which are given
and continued by the Lord, as signs and ^^^des of his covenant and mercy, in
Jesus Christ.

6. And furthermore, by their assertions it will follow, that they which are
baptized in those churches, and dye in that estate, they have not the Lords
baptism, being not come to the Lord in true faith and repentance; and withal
dye out of the covenant of the Lord, and so out of the estate of salvation, in
Churches divorced from the Lord, which have not baptism for a sign of Gods
covenant unto them, and a seal of the righteousness of faith in Jesus Christ.
Now into what a woeful estate by this means they bring all, that are
baptized in those Churches, and so dye, not seeing and leaving the corruptions
thereof: and what grounds besides they lay of Anabaptistrie herein; let such as
are wise observe, and let themselves better consider with themselves
hereafter, and as carefully renounce their wicked opinions and courses, as
they have rashly run into them. And the more, now that they have been
manifested again and again: how ever hitherto they would not take heed to
the instructions and warning given unto them.

7. Finally, whereas they say, The outward washing need not be repeated; and
yet say also, that they have renounced the Romish baptism, as an impure Idol
in their a^^se, they use shifts, and contradict themselves. For if the outward
baptism be an Idol, why do they reteyn it? If it be not an Idol, why have
they renounced it? That which they speak of their abuse, is a shift, and not
to the point in question, as I noted before. Difference is to be put between
a^^ing that is abused, and betvveen the abuse thereof. The Scriptures are the
word of God, and not an impure Idol, to be renounced, though they be abused by
the Papists and themselves. Wine is the good creature of God, and not an impure
thing, to be renounced, though it be abused by drunkards, etc. But of this (God
willing) more hereafter.

This for the present may suffice to show the fraud and impiety of their
dealing. In comparison whereof, the dealing of the Anabaptists, who ^^ding it
to be an Idol and lying sign, do therefore indeed renounce it and receive
another; is more conscionable and religious: though yet ^^^ery deed it be most
sinful and ungodly. For the Baptism had in the ^^urches aforesaid, which
they renounce, is not an Idol and lying sign ^^^ction (as they pretend) but is
in deed true Baptism, and the ordinance (...) ^he Lord, which in mercy he has
given to his church for a sign of his ^^^enant, and has still continued it in
the churches aforsaid, unto this day. ^^^ may appear by the reasons here
alleged before, against the renoun^^^^ of that Baptism, and the receiving of
another: and now also by these, which here follow agreeably thereunto.

Reasons showing, That the Baptism of the Church of Rome and England is not an
Idol and lying sign, etc. but the Lords ordinance and true baptism: and
therefore may not be renounced, or another receyved.
I. Because an Idol, and lying sign, and fiction is an invention of man in the
worship of God. Exodus 20, 4. Psalm. 106, 36 -- 39. Ier. 2, 28. Hos. 13, 2. 1
Cor. 8, 4. and 10, 7. Col. 2, 18, 23. Whereas Baptism in those Churches is of
the holy things of God, a true sign of his covenant, and an institution of the
Lord which the Church of Rome had in the Apostles days: when Antichrist as yet
was not seated there: and has retained it ever since (together with other
Churches derived therefrom) notvvithstanding their Apostasy and great impiety
other ways. Romans 6, 3, 4. with 1, 7. and 2 These. 2, 4. Rev. 11, 1, 2, 19.

II. Else those Churches and the like, should not have a mixture of Gods
ordinances with their own inventions, and so have their thresholds and posts
set by the Lords posts and thresholds among them: but should be utterly
deprived of all and every one of Gods ordinances: if the Baptism and other
like things among them, were all Idols, lying signs, and fictions But they
have such a mixed estate, as is aforesaid (though some far more then other)
like as Israel also had heretofore. As both the Scripture and experience in all
ages does show it to be in all such churches. For which see the Scriptures
aforesaid, and Ezech. 43, 7, 8. Hos. 7, 8. and 13, 2, 4. Amos 2, 11. and 8, 5.
2 King. 7, 3. 1 Timothy 4, 1, 2, 3. Rev. 8, 7, 9, 11, 12. and 11, 1, 2, etc.

III. And if the Baptism of such churches were in deed an Idol and lying sign
and fiction, a detestable and cursed sacrament, then it should be the sin of
those churches to reteyne that Baptism still, and their duty presently to cast
it away. And we also ought to plead with them, utterly to reject it. For so
both they ought to do with all Idols, lying signs, and inventions of men,
brought into the worship of God; and we should also provoke and stir them up
hereunto. Ezech. 20, 7. Esa. 30, 22. Hos. 2, 1, 2. and 13, 2. and 14, 8. 1 Cor.
10, 7, 11, 14. 1 John 5, 21. Rev. 21, 8. Which if either they or we should do,
it would be great sin and impiety in us all. 2 Chronicles. 29, 18, 19. with Ier.
50, 28. and 51, 11. 1 King. 19, 10, 14. Ezech. 43, 8. Amos 5, 14, 15. 1 These.
5, 21. Rev. 11, 1, 2, 19. with Eccles. 7, 16, 17. When Israel fell into
defection, the Prophets that blamed their idolatries, and exhorted them to
leave all their iniquities, did then also reprove them, for not observing
religiously such of the ordinances of God, as were still remaining among them.
Amos 8, 5. with 2, 8, 11, 12. and 5, 4, 5. Ier. 17, 21 -- 27. with 2, 20 -- 28.
and chap. Ezech. 20, 7. with ver. 12, 13. etc. So far were they from
accounting Gods ordinances retained in apostasy, to be Idols and detestable
thing. And when reformation was made in Judah, that they returned to the
ancient syncerity of the Church: they cast away only the filth and loathsome
things that were brought into the Temple; and not either the ^^mple it self, or
any of the holy things thereof that had been polluted but ^^^se they retained
still, as being the Lords (notwithstanding al their de^^^tion) and cleansed
them from the pollutions thereof: and such of the ^^^sels of the Lord, as had been cast away in that apostasy, they also pre^^red and sanctified. 2 Chronicles.
28. with 29, 3 -- 12 -- 16, 17, 18, 19. These things ^^e written for our
learning: and this president may serve, both to direct (...) in the truth, and
to convince the erroneous opinions, and sinful pra^^^ses, wherein so many go
astray, some on one hand, some on another, ^^ndry ways.

IV. Baptism in the defection of Christian churches, is as circumcision was
in the apostasy of Israel. But circumcision in that estate was not an Idol
and lying sign, a false or cursed Sacrament: but the Lords ordinance, a true
sign, and holy Sacrament, had in Israel before their defection, and still
continued in the time of their apostasy: as has also come to pass in the
Christian church, concerning Baptism, through the merciful and powerful work
of God. Genesis 17, 7 -- 14. and Lev. 12, 2, 3. with 2 King. 13, ^^. 2 Chronicles. 30
chap. Jer. 9, 26. Ezech. 23 chapter and 32, 24, 26, 29, 30, 32. Also Matt. 28, 18,
19. Romans 6, 3, 4. with 2 These. 2, 4. Rev. 11, 1, 2, 19. Which we ought
therefore with thanks to acknovvledge and observe, to the praise of God, and
our own comfort: and not to deny so gracious a work of God, or any way to
oppugn it, to the dishonor of his name, and our own unspeakable hurt and
evil.

V. And the Covenant of God is an everlasting covenant; which God continues
and respects, even in the times of apostasy: yea and when he chastises the
breach and transgression thereof. And therefore in this respect also ought we
accordingly to acknowledge circumcision and baptism, given by the Lord to his
people before, and continued still in their apostasy, to be the Lords
ordinances, and his true signs and seals: being assured, that
(notvvithstanding the iniquities of his people, yet) the Lord in mercy both
continues his covenant, and even by this means still calls and stirs us
up to turn unto him: who has betaken himself to be our God, and into whose
Name we are baptized, and do baptize. Otherwise the ground and continuance
of Gods covenant and of the seal thereof, should depend on Man's work and
merit, and not freely and wholy on Gods grace and mercy. Besides that if God
brake the covenant on his part, when men break it on theirs, then should there
still be a new entering into the covenant again between God and man, and a new
baptism daily received again, as the sign and seal thereof. Which is clean
contrary to the nature and eternity of the covenant of God, and to the
^criptures, and the course taken by the Lord, and observed by his people, in
such cases, from time to time. Genesis 17, 7 -- 13. Deuteronomy. 4, 30, 31. and 29, 10 --
15. ^^dg. 2, 11, 16, 19, 20, etc. 2 King. 13, 23. Psalm. 78, 56 -- 65, etc. and
89, 30 -- 34. and 11, 5, 9. Lev. 26, 15, 25, 42, 45. Ezech. 16, 59 -- 63. and
20, 37 -- 44. 2 King. 9, 6. and ^ev. 18, 4. Mat. 16, 16, 17, 18. and 28, 18,
19, 20. Romans 6, 3, 4. Luke 1, 54, 55. Heb. 13, 20.

VI. If such were the baptism of the Church in Rome, and other Western
churches, as is aforesaid, then should it be likewise in the East churches, and
in all Churches of the world, when they fall into sin, breaking the
covenant and commandments of God. Yea so it should be among the Anabaptists
themselves, and al people in all ages, who sin daily, and are continually
subject to transgress against the covenant and precepts of the Lord. And then
should baptism (by their opinion) every where become an Idol, and a lying
sign, and detestable sacrament: and men should day after day still be
repeating their baptism, and taking a new one again and again, as was noted
before. And so should now be revived again the heresy of the Marcionites,
Catharists, and other heretics, who held that Baptism was to be repeated
again and again, when men fell into sin. August. de haeres. etc.

VII. If the Baptism had in the churches aforesaid, were in deed a lying sign
and fiction, etc. then would it also follow, that there should be no salvation
for any members of those churches, reteyning the baptism there received. For
the sign has reference to the covenant and thing signified: and so a lying
sign must have respect to a lying covenant, and false thing signified thereby.
And by a lying covenant, is no salvation to any. Neither is the covenant of
God, a lying covenant, but true and everlasting, and confirmed by the blood of
Christ: Under which whosoever are not, they have not God to be their God in
Christ; and so can have no salvation in him. Either therefore they must grant
the Churches and people aforesaid, to be under the true covenant of God in
Christ, and so the baptism there had to be the true sign and seal thereof:
or else they must deny salvation unto them through the covenant of God confirmed
in the blood of Christ. Which were most wicked once to think or imagine: and
contrary to the riches of Gods grace, and the whole course of the Scriptures
throughout. Genesis 17, 7 -- 13. with Heb. 13.20. and Luke 1, 54, 55. Psalm. 89, 30
-- 34. 1 King. 14, 13. and 19.18. with Romans 11, 1 -- 5. 2 King. 9, 6. and 13,
4, 23. Amos 7, 2, 5. Hos. 14, 1. Esa. 60, 3 -- 11. Matt. 16, 16, 17, 18. Act.
16, 31. Romans 5, 8, 9. and 10, 6 -- 13. 1 Cor. 15, 3 -- 17. Ephesians. 3, 14, 15.

VIII. Finally, the baptism of those churches is from heaven, and not of men:
and is derived unto us from the Apostles of Christ, through the loins of the
church of Rome, and other churches, which have from that time retained and
continued it unto this day. Therefore it is not an Idol and lying sign: but
the true sacrament, and ordinance of the Lord. Mat. 21, 21. and 28, 18, 19.
with Romans 6, 3, 4. Heb. 7, 9, 10. 2 Chronicles. 30 chap. Whereas the other latter
washing which the Anabaptists take up a new unto them selves, is of men, and
not from heaven: whereof they cannot show vvarrant out of the Word of God, nor
how it has been derived unto them from the Apostles, whom Christ sent into the
world to preach his Gospel, and baptize in his Name. In which regard moreover,
all such as being formerly baptized in the churches aforesaid, have renounced
it, and received an other washing unto themselves (whereupon alone they would
rely) had need to consider well in their hearts, whether this be (...) deed a
way devised and misconceived of themselves, and in that ^^ct an Idol of their
own invention, and taken up according to their ^^^^e understanding. Such
things was Israel subject to fall into. Which ^^^^fore Christians now should
carefully regard, in this, and other such (...) of religion. Hos. 13, 1, 2. 1
Cor. 10, 7, 11.

OBJECTION II.
But baptism is corruptly administered in the churches aforesaid: as namely, in
the Church of Rome, with the sign of the cross, with exorcisme, Animadv. p.
68. etc.
exs^^^ation, salt, spittle, oil, and other mo sinful additions and
corruptions of their own, as prayer read by the Priest in an unknowen tongue,
etc. and in the church of England also with the sign of the cross, and with
prayer read out of a book prescribed by men, etc. Besides that in the church of
England, they use the sign of the cross, for a token that they shall not be
ashamed to confess the faith of Christ crucified, and manfully to fight under
his banner against sin, the world, and the Devil, etc. And in the church of
Rome, they hold that baptism conferreth grace by the very action done, etc.
Therefore in their sinful estate, and abuse of baptism, it is not unto them
Gods ordinance, but an Idol, not true baptism, but false; not a true
sacrament, but a false, and a lying sign, as circumcision also in Isreal's
apostasy was unto them: etc.

ANSWER.
1. True it is, that there are great abuses and corruptions in their estate and
ministration, and erroneous opinions held by them thereabout. But will it
therefore follow, that the Baptism there had, is not Gods ordinance, but an
Idol, not true baptism but false, not a true sacrament but a lying sign, and
a fiction? etc. Or will it follovv, because of their errors and corruptions,
that therefore the baptism there had, is to be renounced, and another new one
to be received? If so, then how will they plead for the baptism ministered
among themselves, that it should not also be so esteemed, and renounced, in
regard of their errors, and the corruptions in their estate and ministration,
that are among themselves sundry ways?

2. And how will they show, that the baptism there had is in deed an Idol unto
them, in their estate and participation thereof? Is every thing that is abused
or misapplied by me^, straightway an Idol? or do they that are baptized bow
down to it, and worship it? Though also if that were done unto it, as was
unto the Sun heretofore among the Jews, why might it not yet still
notvvithstanding be true Baptism and Gods ordinance in it self, as the sun
was the true sun, and Gods creature (notwithstanding all their abuse thereof)
even unto them, and in that their (...), vvhiles they made it an Idol to
themselves, and committed idolatry (...) unto. Of which point I shall speak
more hereafter. In the mean (...) let it here be observed, that they baptize
only in the Name of the (...) and with acknowledgment of the Articles of the
Christian faith: as in their form of baptism may be seen: And as the Martyrs,
being urged about their baptism received among them, have always
acknowledged.

3. How also will they prove, that it is a lying sign unto them in their
estate: seeing Baptism (as the other Sacraments both in Israel and under the
Gospel) has this in it to be a sign, by the ordinance and appointment of
God, not at the will and pleasure of man? And God is the God of truth, and
appoints no lying signs, but true and holy ones, for his praise and our
comfort. Neither can man's iniquity make Gods signs to be lying signs: though
they may otherwise be abused extremely. Sinful therefore and erroneous it is so
to think, if not also blasphemous so to speak.

4. Difference then is to be put betvveen Gods ordinance, and man's corruption;
between the baptism it self, and the manner of administration thereof; betvveen
the sign of God, and the errors of men thereabout; between the sacrament
which God has instituted and given to his people, and between the churches
estate where it is administered. Gods ordinance, Gods baptism, Gods sign and
sacrament, is holy and so to be acknowledged: whenas Man's corruption and
unlawful ministration, the churches estate and erroneous opinions thereabout,
are sinful and accordingly to be esteemed. And who dare or can annihilate Gods
ordinance, for man's erroneous persuasions, or the churches corrupt ministration
thereof? Let these things be distinguished carefully, and the truth will
appear presently. Otherwise a thousand errors and evils will ensue, if these
differences be not duly respected, both in this, and in other questions of like
sort.

5. About marriage they have corruptions, errors, and abuses in their estate:
will they therefore say, that their marriage is not true matrimony unto them,
but an Idol and lying ordinance? and so make themselves bastards, illegitimate
and base borne? Or think they that therefore their marriage should be renounced,
and a new marriage, or new vviues to be got again? 1 Timothy 4, 1, 2, 3.

6. Meat and drink, flesh and fish, bear and wine, are daily much abused unto
gluttony and drunkenness; and sundry erroneous opinions also are held
thereabout, among them. Besides that the Apostle says of some, their belly is
their god. Phil. 3, 19. Shall we therefore say, that these things are not the
true creatures of God unto them in their estate, but Idols and lying creatures,
or accursed and detestable things, etc. 1 Timothy 4.1, 2, 3, 4.

7. Even about the Bible and the Scriptures themselves also, they have sundry
corruptions, abuses, and errors, among them, in their estate and ministration.
Shall we therefore say, that the Bible is not the true word of God, but an
Idol and lying book unto them? 2 Timothy 3, 15, 16, 17.

8. Yea and the very term of abuse, which these men use, does plainly show
that it is not indeed an Idol and lying sign: but only is abused by them,
whether idolatrously or otherwise, as by man's corruption has come to pass
with Gods ordinances, in all ages of the world.

9. And now to make it more plain, observe that it is one thing to say of this
or that thing, that it is not the Lords, but an Idol, a lie, a detestable and
cursed thing, etc. And another to say, Men make this or that to be unto them an
Idol, or a vain thing and unprofitable: or that they hold this or that error
about it: or do thus and so abuse it, etc. For the one respects the nature
or being of the thing according to Gods ordinance; the other respects the
abuse thereof through man's corruption and iniquity. The Sun, Moon and
stars (as I noted ere while) were idolatrously abused by the Heathen and
Jews of old: and diverse erroneous opinions also held thereabout among them.
Deu. 4, 19, and 17, 3. with 2 King. 23, 5, 11. Jer. 8, 2. and 44, 17. Should
we therefore say they were not the true creatures of God unto them, but Idols
and lying ordinances? Or was not God then the Lord of hosts, but of Idols and
lying creatures? And had he not still the same sun, moon, stars and other
creatures (which they did sinfully worship) to be as armies about him alvvay
ready to do his will? Or were they, because of such abuse, by any to be
renounced, and a new sun, moon, stars, and other creatures to be created,
and had a fresh: if they had been able to procure it. Thus again we may see
that difference is to be put between the being or nature of things in
themselves, according to the institution of God; and betvveene the corrupt
abuse of them, as men make them to be unto themselves, by their idolatry or
other iniquity, in this or that respect.

10. The Jews profaned the Temple many ways and sundry times: they set
Idols and altars up in it, and tables of money chaungers, and seats of them
that sold doves: and made it an house of Merchandise, and a den of thieues,
in their abuse thereof. 2 Kin. 16, 10 -- 16. 2 Cro. 28, 24. and 33, 4, 7* Jer.
7, 11. Mar. 11, 15, Joh. 2, 14, 16. Was it not now therefore the house of God,
but an Idol and lying ordinance unto them? Or ceased it now to be the Temple
of God, because it was so profaned and abused by them? Or were they now for
the abuse thereof utterly to reject it, and to build a new one? Did not both
the church in former times, and afterward Christ himself and his Apostles, and
the whole church in that age, still hold and use the Temple, as the Lords
house, and his sacred ordinance for the service of his Name? 2 King. 19, 14.
and 22, 3, 4, 5. 2 Chronicles. 29, 3, 4, 5. and 34, 8. Mar. 12, 35. Luke 19, 45, 46,
47. and 21, 37, 38. Ioh. 7, 14. Act. 3, 1. with Esa. 56, 7. The like also may
be observed about the Sabbath, and the profanation thereof, in Judah and in
Israel. Neh. 13, 15 -- 22. Ier. 17, 21 -- 27. Amo. 8, 5.

11. And whereas they say, that circumcision was also a lying sign, and false
sacrament, to Israel in their defection, how do they prove it? Where does
the Scripture teach it? will they have us take it on their bare word, and
believe that their sayings are Oracles? Or will they be wiser and more
righteous then God himself: 2 Kin. 9, 6. and 13, 22, 23. Hos 4, 6, 12. and 14,
1. Amos 7, 2, 5, 15. Mic. 6, 2, 3, etc. with Lev. 26, 25.
who accounted them still to be his people and under his covenant, and himself
to be their God: and upon this ground, called them to repentance, and showed
them many favors: and bare with them a long time, and afterward avenged the
quarrel of his covenant upon them, as he had spoken long before? The history
of the Scriptures, and books of the Prophets, make this matter so plain, as
there is scant any chapter at all, that does not manifest these things, and
convince their error. Some particulars I have showed heretofore Advert. p. 59
-- 63.
otherwhere, and shall now treat of it further hereafter, in answer of another
objection here follovving thereabout.

12. In the mean time, what will they say to the circumcision of Judah in
their estate of apostasy: when they fell into most wicked Idolatry: and that
not only of Isreal's, but even of the heathens, besides all that they had of
their own most sinfully vvithall. Was Circumcision now also among them, none
of Gods ordinance, but an Idol? was it not the true sacrament of
circumcision, but a false and lying sign, a detestable and cursed sacrament,
unto them, in that estate? Were not they now still the people of God? Or had God
broken his covenant with them on his part, and turned his ordinances into
Idols unto them, because of their idolatries and transgressions of his
covenant? Was not God still true, and his signs and sacraments, true signs
and sacraments still unto them on the Lords behalf; though they were become
liars and idolaters themselves? Does God cease to be true, if man become a
liar? God forbid. Romans 3, 3, 4.

13. Or have the Gates of hell more prevayled against the Christian church
since Christ's coming, then they did or could against the church of the Jews
before his coming in the flesh? Mat. 16, 18. Did not God when once he had
given his sign of Circumcision, so continue it still through all generations
until the coming of Christ: notwithstanding all the apostasy both of Judah
and Israel, that then fell out sundry times? And has not the Lord done
likewise hitherto, and will so do unto the end. concerning the sign of
Baptism, in the Christian church, notwithstanding the apostasies and
iniquities fallen out therein? If not, how then also and where, has the
sacrament of baptism ben continued and derived unto these men them selves,
from Christ and his Apostles, unto this day? as I noted here before also to be
observed. Or is one and the same baptism, in one and the same Church, an Idol
and lying sign unto some; and the ordinance of God, and a true sign unto
others, that do there receive it? And this also in their infancy? Or when they
come to years, can they make that which is an Idol and a lying sign (which is
mere vanity and of the devil) now to be unto them the holy ordinance and true
sign of the Lord, which he has given and instituted in his church? Either
therefore it must be acknowledged to be Gods ordinance and his true sign
(though corruptly ministered and abused) or if it be an Idol and lying sign, it
is to be rejected, and another baptism to be obtained, that is appointed and
approved of the Lord. Halting betvveen two opinions pleases not God. If it be
an Idol and lying sign, it is not the Lords: And if it be the Lords (as we
have showed it to be) then it is no idol or lying sign, but Gods ordinance
and true sign, still continued in their corrupt estate and ministration.

14. Neither does this hinder, but that in any churches (whether sincere or
apostate) yea in the best that are or ever were, the ordinances of God may
become unprofitable unto men by their own sins, circumcision may be made
uncircumcision to such as break the law: that is, it may become unprofitable,
and be accounted for uncircumcision unto them. Romans 2, 25, 26. And baptism
therefore in like sort, being now come in the place thereof. But shall we
therefore say, that circumcision, or baptism, or any other constitutions of
God in such Churches unto such persons, are not the Lords ordinances, nor his
true signs and sacraments, but Idols and lying signs, detestable and accursed
sacraments and constitutions? Take an other instance in the Lords supper. Was
the Lords table in the church of Corinth, a table of Devils? or the Lords
supper an Idol, and a lying sign and detestable sacrament, to such as eat it
unvvorthily? Or was it not in deed the Lords ordinance, and his holy Sacrament
unto the^, though sinfully abused by them: as is manifest both by the Apostles
words, when he calls it, the not discerning of the Lords body, but becoming
guilty of the body and blood of the Lord: and by the Lords severe chastising
of them for this cause. 1 Cor. 11, 27 -- 30. Which how should it be, if it
were not the Lords ordinance unto them, which he had given to his church and
people? Does the Scripture so speak of Idols and lying signs any where? Or
does the Lord so punish the neglect or contempt of them? Nay on the contrary,
the Lord severely punishes the regarding and reteyning of Idols: and the
Scripture speaking of them, terms and esteems them to be See M. A^nsw.
Arrow against Idolatry, page 13, and 14.
things of naught, as it were filths, doung or excrements, loathsome things or
detestable, and abominations, vanities, lies, unprofitable, false-vanities,
leasings, and vaine-iniquitie, etc. So far is the Scripture from speaking or
esteeming so honorably of them, as it does of the Sacraments and ordinances of
the Lord, though sinfully corrupted and abused.

OBJECTION III.
But Animad. p. 72, etc.
Idols are of two sorts: some merely devised by men, as Ieroboams 1 King. 12,
28.
calves: some perverted by men from holy signs to Idols, as 2 King. 18, 4.
the brazen serpent. Both these kinds are in popish baptism. For their
crosses, exorcismes, greasings, etc. are Idols of the first sort, worse then
Jeroboams bullocks: their washing with water in nomine patris etc. is of the
second sort, that is, Gods ordinance turned into an Idol, as was the brazen
Serpent. Thus is there a mixture in Antichrists Christening, of both sorts of
abominations. Therefore have we renounced that Romish baptism, as an impure
Idol in their abuse, standing up in the place of Christ and his precious blood,
which it is not: pretending to give grace, and wash away sins, which it does
not: but it is a lie Esa. 44 20.
in the right hand of all that so receiuett: and the saying of the Apostle is
verified in it, an Idol is nothing in the world. 1 Cor. 8, 4. Yet the Apostle
is not contrary to the Prophet who says, their Idols are silver and gold, the
work of men's hands, Psalm. 115, 4. An Idol then for the matter and workmanship
is something, but for the relation unto God, or divine grace, it is nothing:
and thus the Apostle means, as his next words show, 1 Cor. 8, 4.
there is no other God but one. So popish baptism, as touching the material
thing is somewhat, the salt, the water, the oil, are Gods creatures: the
outward action is the work of the hands of an Idolatrous priest: and this work
remains, as did the work of the Idolaters circumcising in Israel: but as
touching the relation (which is the main thing in a Sacrament) that it should
seal up unto them the forgiveness of sins, and (as they blasphemously say)
quite take away sins, and confer grace; so it is a vayn Idol and nothing:
for neither do the true Sacraments in Christ's church work any such effect to
Gods own people: and as for that Antichristian Synagogue, it is not appointed
to salvation, but to condemnation by the just sentence of God. Rev. 17, 11. and
18, 8, 20, 21. 2 These. 2, 11, 12. Therefore it will not help to say, that
baptism in it self considered, is Christ's ordinance: for Number. 21, 8.9.
the brazen Serpent was in it self Gods ordinance at first, and a sacramental
sign of their redemption by Joh 3, 14 ^5.
Christ: yet they that burnt incense to it, made it an Idol, and therefore as 2
King. 18, 4.
Nehushtan, (a piece of brass) it was destroyed.

ANSWER.
What notable shifts, errors, contradictions, abuse of Scriptures, vain
distinctions, and odious assertions are here couched together? And how many in
a fevv lines? Which is the more to be observed, because that now after the
truth herein manifested, these things are by way of opposition advisedly set
down and published, for the more coloring and defense of the former
assertions. So as though for the substance thereof, they agree with the
former, yet considering the time of the writing and manner of dealing hereabout,
they are the more to be regarded and insisted upon. But to speak at large of
every particular, would be long: they are so very many. I will therefore give
short instances of each sort: by which the Reader may better discern, what
great abuse and iniquity there is in such manner of pleas and treatises, how
ever covered with fair shows and pretenses: which are to common with these
and such like Opposites.

SHIFTS.
Shifts.
First then, for Shifts, observe these: 1. A needles distinction of Idols,
nothing helping for the question in hand.

2. Whereas the point here in hand, is, whether the baptism it self, which is
had in the church of Rome, be an Idol, and not true baptism: they would now
somewhat turn it of, by saying, There are two sorts of Idols, both kinds
whereof are in the Popish baptism. Whereby if they mean, that the baptism
there had, is an Idol of both sorts, they do the more increase their error:
of which more hereafter: If they mean not so (to wit, that it is not indeed
an Idol, but only that they have diverse sorts of idolatry in their additions,
opinions, and ministratio^ thereof) they do but use shifts.

3. Of which sort is, that they speak of crosses, exorcismes, greasings, and
such additions annexed in their ministration of baptism; whereas we speak of
the Baptism it self.

4. Also that they speak of the abuse, when as our question is of the thing it
self, notvvithstanding their sinful abuses thereabout.

5. The pretending likewise of the opinions and errors of the Church and
Ministers, when as our question is of the Lords ordinance still continued in
the church, notwithstanding those erroneous opinions and corruptions.

6. And when they say, the Romish baptism in their abuse is a lie in the
right hand of all that so receive it: why is this (so) inserted, but for a
shift, seeing they know that people there receive it usually, when they are
infants? And is it a lie then in their right hand? Then must it also be so in
their own right hand, that were baptized there. Not to speak of the Martyrs
and other servants of God, so baptized in that church, for many generations. So
let them answer what they will, here is either notorious error and
Anabaptistrie (before confuted) or notable shifting, now treated off.

7. Like are the vain pretenses here made about an idol being nothing in the
world: 1 Cor. 8, 4. and yet being something in the matter and workmanshippe
thereof. Psalm. 115, 4. Like as Bellarmine (though in another case, yet with as
ill success) alleges those words of the Apostle saying, Where blessed Paul
says, we know that an Idol is nothing in the world, there an Idol is said
to be nothing, because that although it be something according to the matter,
yet it is nothing formally, etc. Bellarm. lib. 2. de eccles. triumph. cap 5.
tom. 1. controvers. 7.

8. Also in applying the matter and workmanship of Idols made by the hands of
me^, to the matter of baptism, and work of the priests hands that does baptize.

9. And speaking of the relation that is the main thing in a Sacrament, they
make no mention of a sign, but only of a seal; neither therein keep they to
the institution of God, as they ought: but tell us vvithall of men's corrupt
opinions and blasphemous assertions thereabout,

10. Moreover, when they say, as touching the relation (which is the mayn thing
in a sacrament) that it should seal up unto them the forgiveness of sins, and
(as they blasphemously say) quite take away sins, and confer grace: so it is
a vain idol and nothing: for neither do the true Sacraments in Christ's
Church work any such effect to Gods own people: if they mean, that the true
Sacraments in Christ's church seal not up to Gods own people the forgiveness of
sins, it is an error: but if they mean that they do not themselves take
away sins, and confer grace (for this also they annex with the other) then
they use shifts, and keep not to the point of the relation here spoken off, and
as it is appointed to be by the Lord himself.

11. From Gods sentence of condemnation touching Antichrist and his adherents,
they reason to Gods baptism, never condemned by the Lord, but still continued
(through his mercy) in the church and Temple of God, where Antichrist sits.

12. Finally, from the brazen serpent, which was but a temporary and
extraordinary sign, the use whereof now also was ceased, when it was thus
perverted, and which now might lawfully be taken away and destroyed for ever:
they reason to baptism, which is an ordinary sign perpetually to be had in
the church, whose use still continues (notvvithstanding the errors and abuses
had thereabout) and may never be taken away, or destroyed to the end of the
world. And hitherto of these shifts had in this place about this point.

ERROVRS.
Errors.
Secondly, for errors and false doctrines, note these: 1. That the baptism had
in the church of Rome, is an Idol, and a vain Idol, and nothing, euentouching
the relation, which is the mayn thing in a sacrament, etc. Of which more
hereafter.

2. And that whereas Idols are of two sorts, both the kinds are in the popish
baptism. Is then the baptism there had, both like to Ieroboams calves, that
were man's devise; and to the brazen serpent, that from an holy sign was
perverted to an Idol, and now was but as Nehushtan a piece of brass, and so
was destroyed? If this were so, should it not then presently and wholly be
taken away and destroyed? For so was to be done with Ieroboams calves, and
so was done (and that rightly) with the brazen Serpent. Yea, and it was now
esteemed but as a piece of brass, as himself here also notes: and so was
called by Hezekiah. 2 King. 18, 4. According whereunto then the baptism
aforesaid should be but esteemed as the daily washing of our own faces or
hands with water: as indeed some of them also stick not expressly to affirm.
And what is this but very Anabaptistrie, Page 27. etc.
here convinced before. And whereas they apply the crosses, and exorcismes,
and the like, to Ieroboams calves, I observe this also, yet but as a shift:
both because our question is of the baptism it self, and not of the additions
made therevvithall, and because that themselves here afterward speaking of the
Romish baptism in their abuse, affirm, that the saying of the Apostle is
verified in it, an idol is nothing in the world. 1 Cor. 8, 4. and compare it
with the heathens Idols made of gold and silver by the work of men's hands.
Psalm. 115, 4. where speaking of the matter of baptism, they mention the
water, as well as the salt, and oil, there used among the^. Of which more
hereafter.

3. Now also note, that here they say, they have therefore renounced that
Romish baptism, as an impure idol in their abuse, etc. They say not, that
they have only renounced the abuses, as idolatrous: and kept the baptism it
self, as being true baptism and Gods ordinance: but they say expressly, they
have renounced that Romish baptism, as an impure idol in their abuse, etc.
Which if they have indeed so done, as they speak, and as was to be done with
the Idols whereof they speak. then here again is notable error and
Anabaptistrie. And now then what outward baptism or sacrament have they
remaining to themselves? (for of it is all our question.) If they say, they
have the baptism aforesaid, how have they then renounced it, as was to be
done with the calves, brazen Serpent, and heathens idols: specially when they
say in particular of their washing with water, in nomine patris, etc. that it
is as the brazen serpent, which being once Gods ordinance, was turned into an
Idol, and therefore as a piece of brass was utterly destroyed; yea that it is
as the work of men's hands, that made the heathens Idols: Psalm. 115, 4. how
ever again they cross themselves, when they also say, that this work
remains, as did the work of the Idolaters circumcising in Israel. Of which
more in their Contradictions.

4. Note also, that the brazen serpent, was not in deed an Idol, but an holy
ordinance of God, and a sacramental sign of redemption by Christ (as
themselves here afterward acknowledge) which in time came to be idolatrously
abused. Now difference is to be put betvveen an Idol, and that which is the
Lords ordinance, but idolatrously perverted or abused: as I noted here before.

5. Moreover, the brazen serpent was but a temporary ordinance of God, in a
special case, which being idolatrously abused, might wholly be left and
rejected after the special use had thereof, whereunto it was appointed:
whereas the Lords ordinance of baptism, is for ordinary and perpetual use:
and therefore not to be rejected for men's abuses at any time to the end of the
world. Matt. 28, 18, 19, 20. So as the comparison also in this respect is unfit
and erroneous.

6. That the Romish Baptism is an impure Idol in their abuse, standing up in
the place of Christ and his precious blood, which it is not, pretending to
give grace and vvash away sins, which it does not. But the baptism of the
church of Rome is Gods ordinance, had and planted there by the Apostles, before
either Antichrist sat there, or the abuses and errors here spoken of, were
known or had there at all. Romans 1, 7. with 6, 3, 4. Neither does the baptism
stand up in the place of Christ and his precious blood, nor pretend to give
grace and vvash away sins. These are the errors and abuses of men about it,
not the nature of the baptism it self. Otherwise also it should be thus to
all that receive it there, whether old or young: And then all that have
received it, ought to renounce it utterly, and to get another outvvard and true
baptism. Or will these men say, that we can without sin reteyne any thing,
and not utterly reject it (whatsoever it be) that stands up in the place of
Christ and his precious blood, or that pretends to give grace and wash away
our sins: which is to be kept entire to the Lord alone, and to the grace of
God in Jesus Christ. Moreover, the errors and abuses of men, may hurt
themselves, but they cannot change the nature of Gods ordinance in it ^elf.
Man's unbelief cannot make the faith of God of no effect. God is true, though
every man be a liar. Romans 3, 3, 4. The Jews in Christ's time, and before, Romans
9, 31, 32. and 10 3, 4. with Act. 15, 1. and Gal. 4, 21, etc.
holding justification by circumcision and the works of the ^aw, set these up
in the place of Christ and his precious blood, thinking that they had
righteousness and salvation thereby. Should we therefore ^ay, that circumcision
was then an impure Idol in their abuse, standing in the place ^f Christ and his
precious blood, pretending to give grace, etc. Or should we not rather learn
to put difference between Gods ordinance in it self, and be^vveen man's abuse
thereof: still acknowledging the ordinance of God to ^e good and holy, although
men's abuse and aberrations thereabout be ^^nfull and corrupt: as I have shevved
before. Finally, if the Jews circum^ision heretofore became not an Idol, by
these errors and abuses of men: neither does the Christians baptism become
such thereby. Baptism is now the sign and seal of Gods covenant, as
circumcision was of old: and is no more an Idol, though so abused, then
circumcision was.

7. That the Romish baptism is a lie in the right hand of all that receive it.
For confirmation whereof, he alleges Esa. 44, 20. Where the Prophet speaks
of Idols, that Gal. 4, 7. with Esa. 44, 8, 9, 10. etc.
by nature are no Gods, but a lie in the right hand of all that have and
reteyne them. Which if it were true of the Romish baptism, that in the nature
thereof, it were no baptism, but a lie in the right hand of all that have and
reteyn it, then should it without question be renounced as a very Idol in
deed. For such is the lie in the right hand, spoken off by the Prophet, Esa.
44, 20. And the Lord requires every man thus to do with Idols, Cast ye away,
says he, every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not your selves
with the Idols of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. Ezech. 20, 7. Where though
the Lord speak in particular of the idols of Egypt, according to the case and
estate of his people at that time: yet it is the rule and vvil of God for all
Idols: as may appear both by the reason there annexed, in those words, I am
the Lord your God, which excludes the having or reteyning of any Idols at any
time: and by other Scriptures, forbidding al idols at all times wheresoever.
Ezech. 20, 7, 18. with 14, 3, 6. and Lev. 19, 4. Esa. 30, 22. Hos. 13, 2. and
14, 8. 1 John 5, 21. Rev. 22, 15. But here perhaps this man will say, his
words are not simply of receiving it, but of so receiving it as here is said.
So in deed he speaks here: and well may it be, that thus he speaks, to
have a shift and starting hole, after his manner: as I have noted before. But
how ever it be, let us yet examine it, and inquire a little further into this
matter. And first let him now syncerely tell us, whether he hold that the
Romish baptism is a lie in the right hand of all that receive it in the present
estate of the Church of Rome: Esa. 44, 20
as the Prophet here speaks of a lie. If he say, Yea: then both this Prophet
in the same place, and all the Scripture every where teaches, that we may not
reteyne it, but must utterly reject it: and that else we feed but on ashes, and
have our hearts deceived, etc. Esa. 44, 20. with 30, 22. Ezec. 14, 6. and 20,
18. Rev. 22, 15. If he say, No: then all may see, how he does but shift and
cavil, and has spent many good hours, and blotted a great deal of paper to
no purpose, but to maintain error, Anabaptistrie, and impiety: besides that
thus he gives us the cause against himself, and overthrovves al his former
assertions and writing hereabout. Secondly, if some should be baptized in the
Church of Rome, with their crosses, exorcismes, greasings, etc. which he says
are worse idols then Jeroboams bullocks: and yet should not set up baptism in
the place of Christ and his precious blood, thinking it to give grace and wash
away sins: let him now also concerning such syncerely tell us, whether the
baptism thus received in that church should be renounced and rejected, or not.
If he say, it should: then by this will follovv that they hold the baptism of
that church to be an Idol, not only in respect of this opinion, of standing in
Christ's place, etc. which here he inserteth, to bear out the matter with
greater color: but in respect of the other corruptions also, viz. their
crosses, exorcismes, greasings, etc. though this other opinion aforesaid be not
held therewithal. If he say, it should not be renounced and rejected for these
corruptions, but only for the opinion aforesaid: why then do they hold the
baptism of the church of England to be an Idol, where they know this opinion
is not held, to set it up in Christ's place, thinking that it gives grace etc?
Why also makes he such pretenses about this matter, by the crosses, exorcismes,
greasings, and other such corruptions in the church of Rome, if he think that
the baptism there had does not for all these become an Idol: and yet also
says, that they are worse Idols then Ieroboams bullocks? Thirdly, how will
he show (if he were put to it) that baptism in the church of Rome is so
received, as standing in the place of Christ, etc. seeing they are infants
usually that receive it there; considering also Of which see before, p. 29.
their profession of Christ, and baptizing with water, in the name of the
Father, the son, and the holy Ghost: and that this alone is indeed the
baptism of that church: the other things which he speaks off, being not the
baptism it self, but erroneous opinions and sinful addititions thereabout:
Fourthly, keeping still to the Papists opinion, as it is held by themselves
hereabout (of which I will not stand here to treat) let us for better finding
out of the truth, admit that some of years (not knowing better) do so receive
it as here is said, thinking that it conferreth grace and vvasheth away
sins, etc. yet whenas once they are baptized in the Name of the Lord, as is
aforesaid, with the Of which see before, p. 29.
profession that is made of the Christian faith in that church; and shall then
afterward perceive their errors hereabout. let it now well be considered,
whether yet notwithstanding the baptism thus received be in it self an Idol
and a lie to be rejected, or that only the errors and corruptions brought in
by men are to be renounced, and not the baptism it self: which is Gods
ordinance in that church (as circumcision was in Israel) though thus abused and
perverted: and seeing that the very ground of baptism in deed is See before p.
23.
the covenant and promise of God, and not the understanding, much less the
erroneous understanding and opinions of men. Fifthly, to return to the points
we had in hand, let it be observed, that all who are there baptized, do so
receive it, as there it is ministered: and that commonly in their infancy: at
which time they know not what error or abuse is held or done thereabout. So as
if their opinons and abuses make it in deed to be a lie in the right hand of
all that so receive it, as there it is abused and corrupted, the^ should all
that are so baptized, when they come to years of understanding, utterly
renounce it as a mere Idol and a very lie: as the Prophet here teaches, Esa.
44, 2. Which how strongly it implies Anabaptistrie, and seduceth thereunto,
let the wise and unpartiall judge. Finally, when some of the Jews and
Pagans, coming to be Christians according to the faith of the church of Rome,
and making See before page 29.
such profession thereof, as they make themselves, do thereupon (being not yet
further instructed) so receive baptism as there it is held and ministered:
will they now say, that their baptism so received is a lie in their right
hand, as the Prophet speaks, Esa. 44, 20. and yet have them still to reteyne
the same baptism: which if it be unto any, it is unto these and such like,
who being of years, do so receive it, as is aforesaid. Yet the Anabaptists
themselves acknowledge, M. Sm. Character of the beast page 49.
That if the Papacy did not baptize infants, but only men confessing their
faith and their sins, into Christ the Son of God, or into the Trinity,
though they retained their false ministry, worship, and government, and other
their abominations, yet the baptism should be true and not to be repeated.
Which cannot be, if it were a lie in the right hand of all that so receive it.
For how should it both be true baptism, not to be repeated: and yet also be a
lie in the right hand, which is to be rejected? Esa. 44, 20. Either therefore
we must distinguish betvveene the baptism it self, as it is Gods ordinance,
and between the errors and abuses of men that minister and receive it: to
reteyne the one as true and holy; and to renounce the other as false and
corrupt: or of necessity the baptism must be rejected, and rebaptization
admitted. For who can reteyne a lie in his right hand, and not sin? Or who
having grace and godliness would live in such estate as the Prophet speaks off
in the place alleged by themselves. Let this man like it, if he please: The
Prophets saying is, He feeds of ashes, a deceived heart has turned him
aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my
right hand? Esa. 44, 20.

8. That the Romish baptism is such, as the saying of the Apostle is verified
in it, an Idol is nothing in the world, 1 Cor. 8, 4. that is, as othervvhere
he expounds it himself, Annot on Psalm. 96.5. and 83, 19
a thing of naught: and Arrow against Idol. p. 13, 14.
therefore nothing to be esteemed; also, a loathsome or detestable thing, an
abomination; a vanity, a lie, unprofitable, false-vanitie, leasing, and
vaine-iniquitie, etc. And if the saying of the Apostle be verified in it, an
Idol is nothing in the world, then it must needs also follow hereupon, that the
baptism of the church aforesaid has no relation unto God, nor any divine
institution, representation, or signification in it; that it represents no
divine thing at all in the world, and so is in deed mere nothing, touching any
holy signification or use to be made thereof. Of which more hereafter. In the
mean time now observe here, that if these things were true, of the baptism
aforesaid, then it ought of necessity to be rejected; even as the Idols spoken
off here by the Apostle, 1 Cor. 8, 4. ( compared with chap. 10, 7, 14, 19, 20,
21. Exodus 32, 1, 4, 5, 6, 20.) and in the other places by himself Ibid.
otherwhere alleged, Levit. 19, 4. 1 Chronicles. 16, 26. Ezech. 7, 20. and 11, 21.
and 20, 7, 8. Jer. 2, 8, 11. and 13, 25. and 14, 22. and 16, 19. and 18, 15.
and 32, 34. Hos. 4, 15. and 10, 8. Which again is gross Anabaptistrie, joined
with notorious blasphemy.

9. That water (the material thing) in popish baptism, is as the gold and
silver (that is the matter) of the Idols, spoken off, Psalm 115, 4. Whereas the
use of water in baptism is appointed by the Lord, and still to be retained:
Ioh. 1, 33. with Matt. 3, 11, 16. and 28, 19. Act. 8, 36. and 10, 47. but the
use of gold and silver for Idols is forbidden by the Lord, and utterly to be
abandoned. Exo. 20, 23. Deu. 7, 25, 26. and 12, 3. 1 Chro. 14, 12. with Psa.
115, 4 -- 8. and 135, 15-18.

10. That the outvvard action and work of the Priests hands that baptizeth, is
as the work of the men's hands that make the Idols spoken off, Psalm. 115, 4.
But this is a work of hethenish idolatry, utterly to be defaced? whereas the
other is a work of Christian baptism, still to be retained and continued. To
which end let here also be observed, how they blame the comparing of the
church of Rome in their defection, with Apostate Israel, because Animad. p. 48.
the holy Ghost compares Antichrists church with the Rev. 11, 2, 8. and 17, 5.
Gentiles, even the most vile, the Sodomites, Egyptians, Babylonians, and
heathen Romans. Like as the Anabaptists themselves also (disputing against the
baptism of the church of Rome and England, and excepting against the reason
taken from the circumcision of Israel) allege that M. Sm. Charact. p. 48.
the Apostasy of Antichrist is deeper then the apostasy of Israel, because
Antichristians are not called Israelites, but Babylonians, Egyptians,
Sodomites, Gentiles, in the Revelation: Whereby the holy spirit of wisdom
gives us to conceive, that he does account the apostasy equal to Paganism
it self, yea to the very worst kind of Paganism. Whereupon these do utterly
disclayme both the Baptism it self of the Church of Rome, and the comparing of
it with the circumcision kept in apostate Israel: how ever the other
aforesaid, (not without contradiction to themselves in this place and their
other assertions) say here, that the work of the hands of the Idolatrous priest
who baptizeth, does remain, as did the work of the Idolaters circumcising in
Israel. Which how can it be, if the matter and work of baptism (the water,
and outward action of the Priests hands baptizing) be like the matter and
workmanship of the Idols, spoken of Psalm. 115, 4. Of which more hereafter in
their contradictions.

11. Touching the relation (which is the maine thing in a Sacrament) that it
should seal up unto them the forgiveness of sins, etc. so it is a vain idol
and nothing. But observe here first, that the Sacraments in their relation are
not only seals, but signs also. Genesis 17, 11. Romans 4, 11. As themselves
writing otherwhere of circumcision, say, Annot. in Genesis 17, 11.
it is a sign or token, which shows one thing to the eye, another to the
mind. Now (by their assertion here) the Baptism aforesaid shows nothing at
all to the mind: and so it is a vayn Idol, and nothing: and that which it
shows to the eye, is but as the gold and silver of the heathens Idols, Psa.
115, 4. Which if it were true, then in deed here should be nothing of Gods
ordinance, nothing of a true Sacrament, no true baptism, but an Idol. And can
they then blame the Anabaptists, that renounce it wholly; and get another,
which (they think) has the relation of a Sacrament in it? Moreover in the
place aforesaid they say further, that Ibid.
the Apostle calls the sign also a seal, Romans 4, 11. which serves for
assurance of the thing signified. And so the Hebrew doctors use the phrase of
sealing their offspring with the sign of the holy covenant. Maymon. in Misn.
treatise of Circumcision. chap. 3. S. 3. But here they teach that this is not a
seal which serves the receivers for assurance of the thing signified: and so
it is a vayn Idol and nothing. Besides that by this it will follow (as these
also hold) that they are not under the covenant of God, but divorced from the
Lord, and so indeed without all hope of salvation, in that estate. For if any
of them dying in that estate, be saved, then it must needs be that God is their
God, and they his in Christ; and consequently that they are under the covenant
of God: So as then the relation (which is the mayn thing in the Sacrament) may
be found in their baptism, to seal up unto them the forgiveness of sins: And
so it is not then a vayn Idol and nothing: which here they affirm. If they
think to help it out, with that clause of not sealing up unto them the
forgiveness of sins: let them (besides that which is said Page 37. etc.
in the answer of the former objection) consider with themselves, whether
they think that the baptism received in the truest and best churches, do seal
up to hypocrites the forgiveness of their sins. And if they think not, whether
there they will say, that the baptism of those churches, has not the
relation, which is the maine thing in a Sacrament? It is generally held, Act.
8, 13. etc.
that Simon Magus, who was baptized by Philip the Evangelist, was an
hypocrite, and that his baptism did not seal up (as here they understand
sealing up) unto him the forgiveness of his sins: will they therefore say, that
the baptism ministered by the Evangelists, had not the relation, which is the
main thing in a Sacrament? Besides that thus the relation of the Sacraments
should depend wholy upon man, P. 23. etc. and Advertis. page 59, etc.
and not upon the Lord, or his ordinance at all: as I have showed here before.
But to speak of the church of Rome in particular: I ask, whether the baptism
had in that church, seal up the forgiveness of sins unto any of the^ that
receive it, or to none at all. If they say, that it seals this to some of
them: then their assertions here are untrue and erroneous, and the consequents
here before deduced thereabout stand firm against them, and this clause
helps the^ not to shift it of. If they say, to none at all, then neither to
any infants there baptized, and so dying; nor to those that being of years,
leave the estate of that church: and so not to those among these men
themselves, that were there baptized. Now if that baptism there received, do
not as touching the relation (which is the mayn thing in a sacrament,) seal
up unto them the forgiveness of their sins, what other sacrament of baptism
have they that does it? Any other, or none at al? If an other, then they are
Anabaptists, whose error and iniquity is showed before. If no other but it,
then either they must grant that the baptism there received has the relation
of a sacrament, to seal up unto them the forgiveness of sins, or that as yet
they have none at all that does it; but must now get it to themselves: and that
also before they may partake of the Lords supper, as was showed before. And
thus every way they fall into Anabaptistrie, and so into notable error: besides
that now in the mean time they stand Idolaters (and so must be content to be
esteemed) if the baptism which they have received, and still reteyne, have not
the relation of a sacrament unto the^, but be a vayn Idol and nothing.

12. As it is a notorious error in the Papists, to say (as here he notes) that
baptism does quite take away sins, and confer grace: so these men also
themselves err not a little, when they say, that the baptism (which is
retained and received in that Church) has not the relation of a Sacrament unto
them, but is a vain idol and nothing, because they say of it, that it quite
takes away sins, etc. Shall men's erroneous sayings or opinions make a
nullitie of Gods ordinances, of his signs, seals and sacraments? Cannot God
be true, though they be liars? Cannot God continue his own signs and
ordinances, though there be error and corruption in the churches thereabout?
Cannot Gods truth and sacrament stand on his part, though men do err and
transgress on theirs? Does Gods sign and seal loose the relation, and become
an Idol and nothing, if man fall into error and sin concerning it? Annot. on
Genesis 17, 11.
What then shall we think either of that opinion of the Jews touching
circumcision, which himself othervvhere notes, how they say, that at what time
a man is sealed with this holy seal of this sign (of circumcision)
thenceforth he sees the holy blessed God properly, and the holy soul is
united with him. Zohar. treating on Genesis 17, 11. or of that opinion touching
the righteousness of works, whereabout the Apostle testifies, that they sought
for righteousness, by the works of the Law: and so being ignorant of Gods
righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, submitted
not themselves to the righteousness of God. Romans 9, 31, 32. and 10, 3. Now that
among the works of the Law, they also intended Circumcision for one
particular, may appear both by the strait urging of it (even in the time of
the Gospel) upon the Christians of the Gentiles, when certain men which came
down from Judea to Antioch, taught the brethren, saying, Except ye be
circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved. Act. 15, 1. and by
the Apostles particular naming of it, in his refuting of this erroneous opinion
about the works of the Law. Gal. 5, 2, 3. Shall we therefore think, that
circumcision in Israel (while it was in use by the Law of God) was not indeed
the Lords ordinance, nor had the relation of a sacrament unto them, but was a
vayn idol and nothing, because of these or other such like assertions and
opinions then had thereabout? What also vvil they say to the baptism of the
church of England: where they know the popish assertion whereof they speak
is rejected? will they grant that the baptism there received, has the
relation, which is the mayn thing in a Sacrament, to seal up unto them the
forgiveness of sins, and that it is not a vayn idol and nothing, but the
Lords true baptism and sacrament unto them? Let them now well bethink
themselves, what they have said heretofore, and what they say hereafter,
concerning this matter. Finally, besides the relation in a sacrament, there is
also to be regarded, the commandment of God, who has appointed it to be
observed in the church. According as we read that Christ, who was without
sin (and so needed not for himself in that respect this relation of the
sacrament, to seal up unto him the forgiveness of his sins) yet in obedience
of the Law, under which he was borne, and to fulfill al righteousness (being now
also our suerty and redeemer) was himself both circumcised and baptized. Mat.
3, 13, 15. Luke 2, 21. and 3, 21, 22. So as in this respect also, baptism is
still to be observed and acknowledged. And therefore as it had been (even in
this behalf) sin in Israel and Judah (when they were in their deepest
defections) to have rejected circumcision, and not to have used it at all: so
should it now be sin in the church of Rome, if they should reject baptism,
and not keep it. Which again does plainly evince, that it is not a vayn idol
and nothing (for then it were not sin, but their duty, utterly to cast it
away, and not to keep it at all:) but that it is the Lords ordinance, his
baptism and sacrament; which we ought so to esteem and acknowledge,
notwithstanding that both the ministration of it be sinfully corrupted among
them, and themselves be erroneously persuaded in diverse things thereabout.

13. And now by these things also may appear, what an error it is, when they
say, that it will not help, to distinguish between baptism in it self
considered, as Gods ordinance: and betvveen the corruptions and idolatrous
abuse thereof: because the brazen serpent being in it self Gods ordinance at
first, and a sacramental sign of their redemption by Christ, yet when they
burnt incense to it, and made it an Idol, was therefore destroyed as
Nehushtan, a piece of brass. Which is as if they should say, it would not
help to put difference between the Sun, in it self considered as Gods
creature, and between the idolatrous abuse thereof: Or, between the Bible, in
it self considered as Gods word and ordinance; and between the Idolatrous abuse
thereof, etc. because the brazen serpent being at first Gods ordinance, and
afterward idolatrously abused, was destroyed as a piece of brass. Or, as if
there were no difference between baptism, which is an ordinary and
perpetual institution of God; and the brazen serpent, which was an
extraordinary and temporary ordinance of the Lord. Or, that baptism should
utterly be rejected, as being no better then the common washing of our hands
with water, like as the braze^ serpent was destroyed as a piece of brass,
after the idolatrous abuse thereof. How strongly these things savor of
Anabaptisme, and may seduce thereto, let al observe. And hitherto of these
errors, had in this place, about the point aforesaid.

CONTRADICTIONS.
Thirdly, for contradictions, mark these particulars: 1. When they say, there
be two sorts of Idols, Contradictions.
some merely devised by men, as Jeroboams calves, some perverted by men from
holy signs to Idols, as the brazen serpent, which being made an Idol, was
destroyed as a piece of brass: and both these kinds are in popish baptism:
And therefore they have renounced that Romish baptism, as an impure Idol in
their abuse, etc. Whether they mean, that they have renounced it, as the
calves, or as the brazen serpent, or as both of them (as they say both sorts of
Idols and obominations are in it) yet they contradict themselves, when they say
afterward, that the work of the Priests baptizing remains, as did the work
of the Idolaters circumcising in Israel. For this remained so, as it had been
sin for them to renounce it, and to gather their uncircumcision again: and
with this also they did and might come to the Passover, as circumcised
persons: whereas it was not their sin, but their duty, to renounce all
idols, and to destroy them, and leave all idolatry: and this also, before they
came to the Passover. For which see the histories recorded, touching the
abolition of idolatry, and observation of the Passover, both in Hezekias and
Josias time, 2 Chronicles. 29, and 30, and 34, and 35 chapt. with 2 King. 18, 3, 4.
and 23, 1 -- 23. Now to renounce, and to reteyne, are contraries: to remayn,
and to be destroyed, are contradictorie the one unto the other. Or if they say
they speak but of some abuse, and mean not, that they have renounced the
baptism aforesaid as an impure Idol: then besides their shifting noted before,
to what purpose is it (when our question is about the baptism, whether it be
an Idol or not) to tell us that there be two sorts of ^dols, etc. and both
the sorts are in popish baptism, Esa. 44, 20.
and that therefore they have re^ounced it as an impure Idol in their abuse,
etc. Yea, that the Romish baptism is a ^ye in their right hand, etc. and that
the saying of the Apostle is verified in it, an Idol (...) nothing in the
world. 1 Cor. 8, 4. For if so it were, then in deed it ought to be renounced as
a lie and an Idol, and not to remain, as the circumcision ^n Israel did.

2. Again, one while they say, that in popish baptism the washing with
water in nomine patris etc. is an holy sign turned into an idol, as was the
brazen serpent, which in it self was Gods ordinance at first, and a
sacramental sign of redemption by Christ: Another while they say, that in
popish baptism, both the water is as the gold and silver of the heathen
Idols, and the outvvard action or work of the Idola^rous priests hands that
baptizeth, is as the workmanship of the men's hands, that made the Idols,
spoken of, Psalm. 115, 4. and as touching the relation of a sacrament, it is a
vayn idol and nothing, as were the heathen idols whereof the Apostle says, an
idol (...) nothing in the world, 1 Cor. 8, 4. Which though for the matter and
workmanship, it be something, yet for the relation unto God, or divine grace,
it is nothing: and as otherwhere also Arrow against Idol. p. 13, 14.
they speak of Idols, that they are things of naught, because they ^aue nothing
of that which fools think they have: and are therefore nothing to be
esteemed, seeing an Idol is nothing in the world, as the Apostle says 1 Cor.
8, 4.

3. So one while they make as if the baptism of the church of Rome
(whereabout our question is) were like the calves of Israel, and heathens
Idols; neither of which were ever ordained by God, and both of which were
utterly to be destroyed: another while they make as if it were like Isreal's
circumcision, which was Gods ordinance, remaining still in their apostasy, and
not at all to be rejected.

4. Here they say, that the priests work which baptizeth, does remain, as
did the work of the Idolaters circumcising in Israel. Yet Animad. p. 84, 102.
103.
a little after in the same treatise, they mislike in us, and except against the
comparing of the church of Rome with Apostate Israel: yea; albeit that here
themselves compare that churches baptism with the calves of Israel, and with
the Jews brazen serpent, yea even with Isreal's circumcision. Other
contradictions, that might be observed by conference of their assertions
otherwhere, I will not here insist upon Let these suffice for the present.

ABUSE OF SCRIPTVRES.
Fourthly, for abuse of the Scriptures here alleged, Abuse of Scriptures.
that may now also evidently appear by the errors and other particulars before
noted. For although there be many devises of men sinfully annexed to baptism
in the church of Rome, and some wicked opinions erroneously held concerning it
among them: yet baptism both Romans 6, 3.
was there, as Gods ordinance, before these corruptions and errors; and so has been continued in that church to this day; and ought also still to be retained:
the corruptions ^nely and the errors being renounced and rejected. So then the
baptism ^ere had (vvhereabout our question is) neither is like Ieroboams
calves ^^oken off, 1 King. 12, 28. nor is an extraordinary and temporary
sign, 1 King. 12.28.
as was the brazen serpent; nor is to be renounced, as the brazen serpent was
destroyed, 2 King. 18 4.
for idolatrous abuse; nor to be esteemed as the common washing of our face
with water, as the brazen serpent was accounted and called Nehushtan, a piece
of brass: as is said, in 2 Kin. 18, 4.

Esa. 44, 20
2. And for the saying of the Prophet, Esa. 44, 20. if the Romish baptism be as
the lie in the right hand there spoken of, then should it not only be a vain
Idol of man's devising, and utterly to be rejected of all that have so received
it, as there it is ministered: but also til it were so renounced, we might say
of every such a one, as there the Prophet says, He feeds of ashes: a
deceived heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor
say, Is there not a lie in my right hand? Esa. 44, 20. The sinful iniquity of
which Anabaptistrie, is already declared before. Which also convinces the
abuse of this Scripture, and other like allegations of theirs here and
othervvhere.

3. So when they stick not to affirm, that in the Romish baptism the saying
of the Apostle is verified, an Idol is nothing in the world, 1 Cor. 8, 4. how
extreemly again does he abuse the Scripture? 1 Cor. 8, 4.
And how truly is the Apostles saying verified in themselves, that they wax
worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived? 2 Timothy 3, 13. And yet further,
when with this, they compare that which is written of the heathens idols,
Psalm. 115, 4. their Idols are silver and gold, Psa. 115, 4.
the work of men's hands, applying this also to the baptism aforesaid most
ungodly and deceitfully: as may appear by their own words, and by the
shifts, errors, and contradictions, noted out of them here before. And mark how
this Scripture is thus compared with the other of 1 Cor. 8, 4. to show by these
two joined together, that as an Idol, so popish baptism, for the matter and
work is something, but for the relation unto God, for mystical or spiritual
representation, signification, confirmation, sealing, obligation, or the like,
it is nothing, yea, so it is a vain Idol and nothing? Which how like is it
to that of Lib. 2. de Eccles. triumph. etc. cap. 5, tom. 1. contr. 7.
Bellarmine, which I noted here a little before in his Shifts, where he
alleging this saying of the Apostle, We know that an Idol is nothing in the
world, 1 Cor. 8. says, that here an Idol is said to be nothing, because that
although it be something according to the matter, yet it is nothing formally;
seeing it represents that which is nothing, and therefore neither does truly
represent, neither consequently is in deed. Where yet note this difference
withal, that Bellarmine alleges this Scripture, to show (if he could) that
the images had in the church of Rome, (which are Idols, yet) are no Idols
indeed: And he here alleges the same Scripture, to show (if he could) that
the baptism had in the church of Rome (which is not an Idol, yet) is an Idol
and nothing in the world: and this ever touching the relation also, which is
the mayn thing in the Sacrament: as he likewise says. And whereas to have some
color, he a^nexeth, that the Apostle when he says, An idol is nothing in the
world, yet is not contrary to the Prophet who says, Their Idols are silver
and Gold, the work of men's hands, what manner of reasoning is this, but as if
now some other would rise up, and say, Neither is the Prophet contrary to
himself in the same place, when he says, They that make the Idols are like
unto them, and so is every one that trustet^ (...) them, Psalm. 115, 8.
compared with ver. 4, 5, 6, 7. for though the makers of them ^^e not made of
gold and silver, as the Idols be, and though they have mouths, eyes, ears,
noses and hands, that can speak, see, hear, smell, and handle, which the
Idols can not: yet they are notwithstanding spiritually brutish, foolish,
vain, blind and senseless; and so are like the Idols: as other Scriptures
teach us to understand this saying here, Ier. 10, 8, 14. and 51, 17, 18. Esa.
41, 29. and 44, 9 -- 20. Hab. 2, 18. Zach. 10, 2. And what were this to the
purpose, about the question and matter in hand?

4. The other Scriptures here alleged, namely Rev. 17, 11. and 18, 8, 20, 21.
Reu. 17, 11 and 18, 8, 20, 21. 2 These. 2, 11, 12.
^ These. 2, 11, 12. although they be true of Antichrist, with his adherents and
apostasy, and of the mystical Babylon: and so may fitly be applied to the man
of sin and to the mystery of Babylon, with all that lawles estate and
iniquity there spoken off: yet touching the question of Baptism now in hand,
they are vainly alleged, and much abused. For difference is to be put between
Antichrists apostasy; and Gods ordinances therein retained, (though corruptly
used, and mixed with their own inventions:) 2 These. 2, 3, 4. with Ezech. 43,
7, 8. betvveen the man of sin; and the Temple of God, wherein he sits: 2
These. 2, 3, 4. betvveen the Gentiles; and the court of the Temple, with the
holy city, given them to tread thereon, for a time appointed. Rev. 11, 2.
betvveen Babylon (the empiring city of Rome, with the Babylonish estate
thereof;) and the people of God, whom he calls and brings from thence, as
he did his people of old out from Babylon of the Chaldeans, and Lot out of
Sodom. Rev. 17, 3, 4, 5, ^, 18. and 18, 2, 4, 5, 19, 20, 21, with Esa. 48, 20.
Ier. 50, 8, 28. and 51, 6, 7, 8, 11, 45. Zach. 2, 6, 7. and Genesis 19, 12 -- 16.
with Rev. 11, 8. Antichrist, with his apostasy, shall be consumed. His adherents
being strongly deluded to believe lies, and not believing the truth, but
taking pleasure in unrighteousnes, shall be damned the Beast shall go into
perdition: and Babylon, the great city shall be burnt with fire, and thrown
down with violence, and found no more, as the holy Apostles and Prophets
have foretold: As may be seen in the Scriptures and chapters here alleged, 2
These. 2, 3, 8, 11, 12. Rev. 17, 11. and 18, 2, 8, 18, 20, 21. compared with
Ier. 50, and 51. Esa. 13, and 14, and ^1, 1 -- 10. and 47. Dan. 5. Hab. 2,
Zach. 8, 9. Ier. 51, 61 -- 64. But vvil it therefore follovv, that the Baptism
had in the church of Rome is no ordinance of God, no sign, seal, or sacrament
of the Lords, but a vain idol and nothing; and to be renounced, as an impure
idol in their abuse; yea to be a lying sign, a detestable, and cursed
sacrament, as they often speak of it? Or, that all who are there baptized, and
retayn the baptism had in that church, as the Lords sacrament, sign, and
seal unto them of the forgiveness of sins, shall be damned? Do the Scriptures
here alleged, prove these things? If not, how greatly do they abuse the
Scriptures, and their Readers? as the papists also do continually. Yet
notvvithstanding we may not because of their abuse, account the Scriptures to
be an idol, or a lie in their right hand, or nothing in the world, etc. but
we must still esteem them to be the holy word of God, the light of our feet
and joy of our hearts, the true and sure testimonies of the Lord: how ever they
be perverted and abused by them. And hitherto of their abuse of the Scriptures
in this place.

VAIN DISTINCTIONS, AND Anabaptisticall assertions.
Vain distinctions and Anabaptisticall assertions.
Fifthly, for vain distinctions, and Anabaptisticall assertions: observe these:
1. That he makes two sorts of Idols, and says both the kinds are in popish
baptism: and yet neither of them is to the point in hand: as may be seen by
the particulars aforesaid. Besides that in right propriety of speech, this
rather shows two sorts of Idolaters, then of Idols: the brazen serpent being
not in deed an idol, but only idolatrously abused by them 2 King. 18, 4.
that burnt incense unto it. Neither does the Scripture (that I can find) call
it an Idol: or any where take Idols to be types and sacramental signs unto
us of redemption by Christ, as Number. 21 8, 9. with Joh. 3, 14.15.
the brazen serpent was to Israel in the wilderness: as here by themselves is
observed. Thus also (as they do) not two only, but many sorts of Idols may be
made in other respects: As besides those that are here named by themselves; and
such also, as are only fictions and imaginations of the mind; some to be of
such things as being given by the Lord, for the common use and service of the
world, yet are made Idols by men unto themselves, Lev. 19, 4. Deu. 4, 15, 16 --
19. Ier. 10, 2, 3. Hos. 13, 2, Act. 27, 42, 43. Phil. 3, 19. Col. 3, 5. 1 John
5, 21
as the Sun, Moon, Stars, etc. some parts of the body, and other creatures
given to man also for his use, as the belly, money, and the like, are by many
made their God: Also kings and Princes in kingdoms; Husbands, vviues, and
children in families; Ministers and people in churches; yea the church, and
Christ himself, are often made Idols, by the vain opinions, sins, and abuse
of men: and many other the like things, which were long to declare and insist
upon in particular. But shall we therefore say, that these indeed are Idols,
and so many several sorts of Idols also? And that they are not the true Sun,
Moon, Stars, etc. Or should we not rather acknowledge, that these are the
Lords good ordinances, benefits, and mercies unto us: which many abuse
idolatrously, to their own hurt, and to the dishonor of God; but not to the
annihilating of the Lords institutions themselves? And now by this occasion,
let me wish these men to consider well with themselves, whether their own
errors (about this and other matters) be not in deed idols before the Lord:
Exodus 20, 4.5.6. Ezec. 14, 7. Hos. 13, 2. 1 John 5, ^1.
such as be all erroneous opinions and courses in religion, which men frame to
themselves according to their own understanding; whether concerning Christ
himself, or concerning his faith, order, worship, or any part of religion;
otherwise then the Lord has himself prescribed in his word. By means whereof
it comes often to pass, that many who think themselves most free from
idolatry, and have their eyes only bent upon others in this behalf, are yet
notwithstanding them selves deeply plunged therein.

2. It is also a vayn distinction, as touching the question in hand, when to
reconcile the Apostles words who says, an idol is nothing in the world, 1
Cor. 8, 4. with the Prophets words, who says, their idols are silver and
gold, the work of men's hands, Psalm. 115, 4. they tell us, that an idol for
the matter is something, but for relation to God or divine grace it is nothing.
For what concerns this the Lords ordinance of baptism, that is the sign of
his covenant, and has relation thereto, etc? Or what agreement have idols with
the Lords ordinances: that here they give us idle distinctions concerning Idols?

3. For other odious and Anabaptistical assertions note these now likewise
together, which have here before upon several occasions ben observed already.
1. That he calls Christ's baptism (corrupted) Antichrists Christening. 2.
That making two sorts of Idols, he says there is a mixture in Antichrists
Christening, of both sorts of abominations. 3. That therefore they have
renounced the Romish baptism, as an impure idol in their abuse, etc. 4. That
it is a lie in the right hand of all that so receive it, Esa. 44, 20. 5. And
that the saying of the Apostle is verified in it, an idol is nothing in the
world. 1 Cor. 8, 4.6. That the water in baptism there received, is as the
gold and silver of the hethens Idols, spoken of, Psalm. 115, 4. 7. That the
outward action and work of the priests hands in baptism, is as the work of
men's hands that make the Idols aforesaid. 8. That touching the relation (which
is the mayn thing in a Sacrament) etc. so it is a vayn Idol and nothing. 9.
That it will not help to say, that baptism in it self considered, is Christ's
ordinance (though corruptly abused and administered among them) because the
brazen serpent being in it self Gods ordinance at first, and a sacramental
sign of redemption by Christ: yet they that burnt incense unto it, made it an
Idol, and therefore as Nehushtan (a piece of brass) it was destroyed. What
strength this gives (if there were truth and weight in it) and how near it
comes to that other assertion, which some among the^ boldly affirm, that the
baptism aforesaid is no more or better to be esteemed, but as the common
washing of our hands or faces with water, let such as are wise consider: As
also what great seduction and erroneous grounds leading to Anabaptistrie, are
cowched in the assertions aforesaid. And these, so many together in the
compass of one page, besides infinite the like othervvhere. Wherein they
should have had the more care of their own sayings; least while they impute
blasphemy to the Papists (as here they do, and justly) they fall themselves
also, by their assertions, into the same transgression and impiety.

Other things more might be observed and answered about the particulars
aforesaid: but these are enough: and more then here I would have noted, but
that their own dealing, and the regard of others and of the truth it self, did
urge me thereunto. And hitherto of the Shifts, errors, contradictions, abuse of
Scriptures, vain distinctions, and Anabaptisticall assertions, found in these
few lines. What abundant store of such stuff he has about his and other
matters besides, in this treatise of his (which were endless ^o insist upon in
particular) may even by this little sufficiently appear to such as are
judicious and unpartiall. Now here I will only proceed to one or two more
objections that are much urged about the matter in hand.

OBJECTION IIII.
But Israel in their defection (from whom diverse of the former reasons and
answers are taken) becoming Apostate, M.A. etc
when Jeroboam set up the golden Calves, Animad v. p. 68, 70. 81, 82, 88, 89,
90, 91, 92, etc.
and Israel committed Idolatry with them, were not in their apostaste the
people of God, or his church: but were cast off by the Lord, and divorced from
him; the covenant was broken not only on their part, but also on his: so as
now he gave them a bill of divorce, and ceased to be their God, and they to be
his people. And (as touching circumcision or any such ordinances retained among
them) Animad. page 70.
seeing they then were fallen 2 Chr. 15 3.
from God, and from his church, and so were Ier. 3, 8.
divorced from the Lord, and were Hos. 2, 2.
not his wife, but Hos. 13, 1
dead in their sins: the ordinances of God which they in show retained, could
not be unto them the signs and seals of forgiveness of sins, and of life
eternal, and therefore were in their use of them, false and deceitful; as
were also the ordinances of God retained in other nations, as Numb. 23.1.
Pompon. Laetus de sacerdo. etc.
Altars Sacrifices, Priests, tithes, first fruits, incense, meat offerings,
drink offerings, feasts, baptismes or washings, anoyntings, exco^munications,
prayers, vows, and many the like, whereof al histories do bear record, that
the Gentiles did reteyn the^.

ANSWER.
Very erroneous and ungodly assertions are here again: and such as are
directly contrary to the Scriptures, in the true meaning and intendement
thereof. For the Lord was yet still their God, and they his people and church,
both in the account of the Lord himself and of his holy Prophets: as Advert. p.
59 -- 63.
in another treatise I have showed heretofore. Which being still so erroneously
denied, and colourably oppugned by them, I will therefore now again insist
hereupon. And that also the more largely, considering the weight of the matter,
and their abuse of the Scriptures about it. Yet will I but treat of some
special particulars, of the exceeding many testimonies of Scripture, and
reasons that might from thence be deduced about this matter.

1. The Prophet that anointed Iehu King over Israel, spoke thus unto him, in
the Name of the Lord, 2 Kin. 9, 6. etc.
Thus says the Lord God of Israel, I have anointed thee King over the people
of the Lord, even over Israel, etc. 2 King. 9, 6. Where first observe, that
there was almost an hundred years, and in that time Jeroboam, Nadab Baasha,
Elah, Zimri, Tibn^, Omri, Ahab, Abaziah, Iehoram, Iehu.
ten kings, from the defection of Jeroboam the son of Nebat (who set up the
calves) unto Iehu now anointed to reign over Israel. Al which time, the Lord
was yet still their God, and they his people, as the Prophet here affirms in
the Name of the Lord. Which that it may the better appear, I would ask of
these Opposites, first, whether this Prophet spoke truth or falsehood, when
now he said, Thus says the Lord God of Israel? Secondly, whether the Lord
himself spoke truth or falsehood, when he said to Iehu by the Prophet, I have
anointed thee King over the people of the Lord, over Israel? And thirdly,
whether Iehu was anointed a true King in deed (and not supposedly only) over
Israel the people of the Lord? Fourthly, let us compare herewith the like
speech of the Lords concerning David, when he said Chro. 6, 5 6. with 2 Samuel
5, 2. and 2 Kin. 20, 5.
I have chosen David to be a ruler over my people Israel 2 Chronicles. 6, 5, 6. And
was not this so in truth and in deed? Finally, mark that in this speech,
Genesis 17, 7 Esa. 63, 19
the words of the covenant are still retained and expressly used, when the
Prophet says not only, The Lord, but The Lord God of Israel, and again, the
people of the Lord, even Israel. Now if the Lord and his Prophet spoke the
truth as the thing was in deed, then these Opposites teach falsehood: and so
if the Scripture be true, their vvritings and assertions are false. Yea they
deal far worse then the Captains that were then with Iehu, who (how ever
in a svvaggering vein they called the Prophet 2 King. 9, 11.
a mad fellow, before they knevv why he came to Iehu, yet) when they knevv
the man and the matter, they presently shevved by their deeds and words, that
they esteemed his message, as the word and work of the Lord; and himself, as
the Lords Prophet, and not as a mad fellow: much less as a false fellow, that
spoke leasing of the Lord and of Israel, or any otherwise then as the case
then stood in deed and in truth. 2 Kin. 9, 1 -- 13. with 1 King. 19, 15, 16.
This dealing of those Captains, will rise up in judgment against these men:
if still they go on in despising the word of God, and reviling his servants,
and will not upon knowledge of the will of God showed unto them, yield
thereunto: as these Israelites (now in apostasy) did in the matter aforesaid.
Which I note the rather, because 2 Kin. 9, 6.
this Scripture (with some other) has been Adver. page 59.
showed them heretofore: and yet they cease not, but set themselves purposely
to oppugn us herein.

Now to proceed, after Iehues time also, the Scripture shows, that when
Hazael king of Syria had oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz (the son
of Iehu) 2 Kin. 13 22, 23.
the Lord was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect
unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would
not destroy them, neither cast he the^ from his presence as yet. where mark
these things, first how the Lord of his free grace holp and preserved Israel in
their misery, because of his covenant with Abraham and the Fathers, wherein he
had promised to be not only their God, but the God also of their seed after
the^. Genesis 17, 7. Secondly, that God had not cast them from his presence as
yet. And this was above an hundred years after the time of Jeroboam the son
of Nebat, as the history shows. So as this Scripture alone sufficiently
declares, that Israel was yet still under the covenant of the Lord: and that
both in the Lords own account, and in the estimation of the Prophets that
recorded these things.

Moreover, the Scripture records, that 2 King. 14, 23, 25.
Jeroboam the son of Ioash (the thirteenth king from Jeroboam the son of
Nebat that made the calves) restored the coast of Israel from the entering in
of Hamath, unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the Lord God of
Israells which he spoke by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai
the Prophet. Where again observe those terms, the word of the Lord God of
Israel, which he spoke by his servant Jonah the Prophet. Was this then the
word of a supposed Lord God of Israel, or of him that was in deed and in
truth the Lord God of Israel? Was Jonah the servant and Prophet of an
imaginary God, or of him that was indeed (both in the Lords account, and in
his own persvvasion) the Lord God of Israel? Or was it any other God then
this, to whom Jonah prayed in his distres when he says he prayed to the Lord
his God etc. Jon. 2, 1 -- 9
Or did he pray to any other God, then the only true God, that was the God of
Israel, by his covenant of grace made with the Fathers? 2 Kin. 13, 23.

Many the like sayings might be produced out of the history of Israel, and
books of the Prophets: which were long to note and urge in particular: and
there will be occasion to speak more hereafter about this matter. Here
therefore I will but cite some places, which the Reader may turn unto, and
observe, about the point in hand, 1 King. 14, 7, 13. and 16, 33. and 17, 1, 12,
14, 18, 20. 2 King. 5, 15, 17. 2 Chronicles. 30, 6 -- 9. Hos. 4, 6, 8, 12. and 5, 4.
and 12, 8, 9. and 13.4, 5, 13, 16. and 14, 1. Amos 7, 15, 17. and 9, 10. Mich.
2, 3 -- 9. with 1, 1. and Amos 3, 1. and 8, 2. Where the Prophets expressly
call and with a joint consent account Israel in their defection (as they did
Judah also in their apostasy) to be the people of the Lord, and the Lord to be
their God: and this also in deed and in truth, as the places themselves and
the matters spoken off, with the circumstances thereabout, do plainly
manifest. And that these terms ( Thy God, and my People, and the like) so
often used, both touching Israel and Judah, are terms and notes of the
covenant, is so evident throughout the Scriptures, as it is strange that any
should offer to deny it. For which see, Genesis 17, 7. Exo. 3, 15, 16, 18. and
6, 7. Lev. 2, 13. Number. 10, 9, 10. Deuteronomy. 1, 21. and 4, 23, 24. and 7, 16. and 8,

35, 2, 4. and 37, 16, 21. Jer. 2, 13, 17. and 7, 28. and 19, 3. and 23, 2. and
28, 14. and 29, 4. etc. Ezech. 13, 10, 18. Hos. 2, 23. Mich. 6, 3, 5. Zach. 2,

2. Otherwise the tribe of Judah (which is also called the people of the Lord,
and God said to be their God) when they 2 Kin. 21 22. and 22. 17. 2 Chr. 12,
1, 5. and 21, 10, 11. and 24, 20.24. Esa. 1, 4, 21. Ier. 1 16. and 2, 13. etc.
forsook the Lord, and became Apostates and Idolaters, and committed other
notorious sins besides, and that in such sort, Ezec. 16.2.51. and 23, 2 --
11. etc.
as they justified Israel and became more corrupt then she (for which the Lord
punished them seveerely, and cast them out of his land into captivity in
Babylon) should not indeed and in truth be accounted the people and church of
God. Neither should those terms, ( My people, Thy God, and the like, spoken
concerning them by the Prophets, in such estate) imply and teach us, that yet
notwithstanding they were then still under the covenant of God, and so both by
the Lord himself and by his Prophets esteemed to be his church and people. Jer.
2, 11, 13, 17, 31, 32. and 3, 20, 21. and 4, 11, 22. and 5, 31. and 6, 14, 27.
and 7, 2. -- 12 -- 28. and 8, 7, 19, 21, 22. and 15, 6, 7. and 18, 15. and 23,
2, 13, 22, 27, 32. and 28, 14. and 29, 4, 8. etc. Ezech. 13, 10, 18. with 8,
and 9, and 10, and 11 chap. and 16 chapter and 23 chapter Obad. ver. 12 and 13. Micah.

2, 7. and 3, 2.

3. And if we look to former times, the children of Israel (all the tribes of
old, both Judah and Israel together) in the times of the Judges, etc. should
not be the people and church of God: if the exceptions aforesaid were of
weight. For they also then forsook the Lord, and fell into defection, and
became great idolaters: and were for that and other their sins often and
sore punished of the Lord. As in the book of Judges may be seen. Judge. 2, 11,
12, 13, 19. and 3, 5, 6, 7. and 6, 1, 10, 25 -- 30. and 8, 27. and 10, 6. and
17 chap. and 18, 30, 31. with 1 Samuel 7, 3, 4. and 12, 9, 10. and Psa. 78, 56,
57, 58, 59. etc. and 106, 34 -- 39, etc. 1 Kin. 11, 33. Besides that Ezekiel
and others note the like also concerning them, when they were in Egypt; in the
wilderness; and in the land of Canaan. Ezec. 20, 7, 8, 9, 10 -- 27. etc. and 23,
2, 3, etc. Amos 5, 2^, 26, 27. with Act. 7, 38 -- 43.

4. But to insist on the ten tribes more particularly, and yet further to
observe some more things out of the Prophets and other Scriptures concerning
them: let us first of al remember, that the Lord when he brought Israel out
of Egypt, and gave them his Law, spoke these words and said, I am the Lord
thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, Exo. 20, 1, 2, 3,
etc.
out of the house of bondage: Thou shall have no other Gods before me, etc.
This I suppose they will not deny to be spoken by the Lord to his church and
people indeed and in truth. Now Hoseah the Prophet in his time (about two
hundred years after Jeroboam the son of Nebat had set up the calves at Dan
and Bethell, and caused Israel to sin) speaking unto Ephraim, who had now
ben so long in defection, says unto them in the Name of the Lord, Hos. 13, 4.
Yet am I the Lord thy God from the Land of Egypt, and thou shall know no God
but me. etc. Hos. 13, 4. with v. 1, 2, 3. Where observe, that in Exo. 20, 2
Hos. 13, 4.
in both places, the words of the covenant are used, and in the same terms, I
am the Lord thy God, etc. Which shows plainly, that they were now still
the Lords people, under his covenant, and were so esteemed by the Lord himself
and by his Prophets in deed and in truth.

5. By the Hos. 13, 4
same Scripture appears also, that they were accounted now still not only
the Lords people, but even as the same people of Israel, whom the Lord brought
out of Egypt: notwithstanding that they lived now so many generations after,
and had gone through so many chaunges of their estate, and were also fallen
into great defection, and had so long continued in that apostasy: and were
not yet cast out of the land of Canaan, etc. Which appears yet further, by
the next words in the same place, where the Lord also says, Hos. 13, 5 6.
I did know thee in the wilderness. etc. And, According to their pasture
(speaking of the land of Canaan) so were they filled. Hos. 13, 6. and by
diverse other like speeches of the Prophets: which were long to insist upon in
particular: as namely, when the Prophets say, Hos. 10, 9. and 9, 9.
they had sinned from the days of Gibeah (which was Iud. 19. etc.
in the time of the Judges) and Hos. 13, 10, 11, 12. with 1 Sa^ 8. etc.
from the days of King Saul: and had yet still ben partakers of Gods mercies:
Hos. 11, 1 -- 4. with 13, 4, 5.
from the coming out of Egypt, whence he brought them and guyded and fed them
in the wilderness: yea, even Hos. 11, 1 -- 4. with 13, 4, 5.
from the birth of Jacob, Hos. 12, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10 11, 12. etc
and the Lords speaking with him at Genesis 3^ 6-11. etc.
Bethell: Whereabout those words of the Prophet are remarkable, The Lord found
Jacob in Bethell, and there he spoke with us. With us, says the Prophet
Hosea, speaking of Israel and himself together, now at that time. Hos. 12, 4.
The like testimonies may be observed also in other of the Prophets: as in Amos
2, 6, 8, 9, 10, etc. and 3, 1, 2. and 9, 7. with 6, 8, and 8, 7. and Mich. 2,
7. and 6, 2 -- 5. compared with Ier. 2, 6. etc. By all which appears how the
Prophets esteemed them still to be the Lords people, whom he brought out of
Egypt, and to be under his covenant, etc.

6. Moreover, the land (where Israel now dwelt in Canaan) was Hos. 9, 3
the Lords land: like as was that of Judah also, Joel 1, 6, 7. In respect
whereof, the land of other nations, as of Assyria and the like, was a polluted
land: whither to be driven, and there to dye, was also threatened as a
punishment. Amos 7, 17. whereas Israel was not yet driven out of the Lords
land (and so had not yet a bill of divorement) when Hoseah and Amos prophesied.
Hos. 9, 15. with ver. 3. and Amos 7 and 8 chap.

7. Neither was the Lord yet departed from them, nor they as yet cast of by
him. Hos. 9, 12, 17. with 2 King. 13, 23. All which shows, how they were
still the Lords people, and under the Lords covenant made with Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, as is expressly mentioned, 2 King. 13, 23. and how greatly
therefore they err, who do not (in this behalf) make other or better account
of Israel in their defection, then of the heathen nations, etc. Of which more
hereafter.

8. To the same purpose may be noted, how the Lord blames Israel, for not
observing Amos 8, 2 -- 5, etc.
the New moons and Sabbaths, as they should: Which were ordinances of the
church of God: and for which the heathen nations are never blamed. Which also
were part of the partition wall then standing betvveen the Jews and Gentiles:
and plainly shows, how the Lord still accounted them for his church and
people, although they had now fallen into great backsliding from him.

9. The like may be noted, in that the Prophets rebuke Israel, as well as
Judah, for making covenants with the Assyrians and Egyptians, relying on them,
and seeking help at their hands, and not of the Lord, in their distress.
Ezech. 23, 2, 5, 6. with ver. 11.12, 13. Also Hos. 5, 13. and 7, 11. with Esa.
30, 1 -- 7. and 31, 1, 8. Ier. 2, 36. etc. and with Deuteronomy. 7, 1, 2. etc.

10. Also, in that they reckon it among the sins of Israel, that Hos. 5.7.
and 7, 8.
they begat strange children, being mixed in marriage with the people of other
nations. Like as it is reckoned among the sins of the Israelites generally,
Judge. 3, 5, 6. with Psalm. 106, 34, 35. and of Judah also particularly, and is
noted as a breach of the covenant among them, Mal. 2, 11. Ezra. 9 and 10 cha.
Neh. 13.1, 2, 3.4, 23, etc. Which could not so have been to Israel, as it was
to Judah, had they not ben now still the people of God, and under his covenant,
as Judah was: notwithstanding this and their other manifold iniquities, so
much and sharply reproved by the Prophets. Or does God ever blame the nations,
or any persons that were not his people and under his covenant, for mixing
themselves in marriages and covenants with other people, for begetting strange
children, for seeking help at their hands, etc. So as these things also show
Israel still to be the people and church of God, to whom these laws were
given, and of whom was required obedience thereunto (for not marying and
covenanting in such sort with the heathen of other nations) together with the
rest of the laws of God. Exodus 34, 15, 16. Deuteronomy. 7, 1 -- 6, etc. with 1 King.
11, 1, 2. and Hos. 5, 7. and 7, 8..

11. And generally, that Hos. 8.12.
the Lord wrote unto them the great things of his law. Which he showed not to
other nations, as he did to Israel, to whom he gave his statutes and
judgments. Psalm. 103, 7. and 147, 19, 20. with Deu. 4, 5 -- 8.

12. Also, that Amo. 2, 6, 7.
the Name of God is said to be profaned by Israel, as well as by Judah: who^
these men themselves (I think) will not deny to be the church and people of God,
remaining then still under his covenant, etc. Amos 2 6, 7. compared with Esa.
52, 5. and 63, 19. Ezech. 36, 20, 23.

13. Hos. 13, 12, 13.
Yea Ephraim is acknowledged for " a son (though an unwise son) being now
in defection: And Israel is Hos. 8, 1, 2. Amo. 3 1.
the house and family of the Lord: and together with Judah is so called. Amos
3, 1, 2. with 2, 4, 6. Hos. 8, 1. and 9, 15. Which term also is attributed to
the churches of the Christians, the churches of God now in the time of the
Gospel. 1 Timothy 3, 15. 2 Timothy 2, 20. Luke 12, 42.

14. And when a vision of judgment Amo. T^ 1 -- 5.
upon Israel was shevved to Amos the Prophet, he prays for them, as being now
still So Danaeus, Calvine and others expound and understand it.
the people and church of God, and under the covenant of the Lord, when he
says, O Lord God forgive, I beseech thee, by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is
small. Amos 7, 2. And again, when another like vision was showed him, O Lord
God cease, I beseech thee, by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small. ver. 5.
Where the Prophet, in his prayer to God for Israel, uses two reasons of
weight, implying so much. First, when he calls this people Jacob; not Edom,
Moab, Ammon, Ashur, Cush or the like, that were strangers from the promise and
covenant of God: but purposely terms them Jacob, as being the children of
Jacob, of his seed and family, and therefore the chosen and adopted people of
God, whom he loved and took into covenant, and to whom he promised and showed
mercy, etc. 2 King. 13, 23. with Mal. 1, 2. Amos 8, 7. with Psalm. 47, 4, 9.
and 14.7. and 83, 3 -- 8. Ier. 2, 4. Hos. 12, 2 -- 12. etc. Secondly, when he
alleges that Jacob (this people) was small, having ben sore afflicted, and
almost worn out by enemies and other calamities: as appears in the books of
the Kings. 1 King. 16, and 2 King. 8, 12. and 13, 22. and 14, 26. and
othervvhere in the history: so that (although their sins deserved Gods
chastisement, in respect of themselves, yet) now the Prophet was earnest
with the Lord, that he would remember Jacob (this people of his) in mercy,
and not utterly consume them: but now the more to pity them and show them
mercy, when they were become small, and brought so low. And thus much is
acknowledged by these men themselves othervvhere: Annot. o^ Psalm. 14, 7. where
David saying, When the Lord returns the captivity of his people ^aacob
shall be glad, Israel shall rejoice: the note is thus word for word: Iaacob,
Israel] that is, Gods people, the posterity of Jaacob, who also was called
Israel: (So Aaron is put for his posterity, the Aaronites, 1 Chronicles. 12, 27.
and 27, 12. and David for his children, 1 Chronicles. 14, 31.) Jaacob is a name that
notes infirmity, etc. But to return to the prayer of Amos the Prophet, the
very same reasons that ^e uses here touching Israel, are also used in prayer
unto God, concerning Judah, Psalm. 79, 6, 7, 8. etc. and in more general
terms, touching all Israel jointly, long before, in Moses time, Psalm. 90, 13.
So as these prayers of Amos for Israel in defection, are the more to be noted,
both for that they agree with the like prayers made othervvhere for Judah
(whom these men themselves vvil acknovvledge to be the people and church of
God, notvvithstanding they also forsook the Lord, and fell often into
idolatry, and other great iniquities:) and because the Prophet thus prays
for Israel again and again, twice using and as it were urging these reasons
to the Lord; who both the times heard, and yielded to these his requests,
concerning them. Amos 7, 2 -- 6. with 1, 1. and 2 King. 14, 26, 27.

15. Yea when afterward the Lord gave Israel into the hands of the Assyrians
for their sins, yet he so regarded them, as Ier. 50.17.18.
he punished the King of Assyria that devoured Israel: like as he punished the
king of Babylon, that brake the bones of Judah, whom likewise for their
sins the Lord gave into the hands of the Babylonians. And both to Israel and
Judah, he promised mercy and forgiveness of sin, to the remnant of both of
them (not of Judah only, but of Israel also) whom he would reserve. Ier. 50,
17 -- 20. Either therefore let them deny Judah then to have been the church and
people of God, or let them also yield it unto Israel: seeing both fell into
defection from the Lord, and both were chastised by him, and both their
enemies punished, and mercy promised to the reserved remnant of them both: As
the Prophets many times teach. For which, together with the Scripture
aforesaid, see also 1 Chronicles. 9, 1, 2, 3. Esa. 17, 3 -- 6. Ier. 50, 1 -- 4. Hos.
1, and 2, and 3 chapter etc. Micah 1, 1. and 2, 12. and 4, 10. and 5, 6, 7, 8. and
7, 18, 19, 20. Nahum 1, 1, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15. and 2, 1, 2, 3. and 3, 18, 19.
Zach. 1, 18, 19. with 8, 13.

16. Finally, so long as Israel dwelled in the land of Canaan (which was the
Land of Promise) and there enjoyed their own policy (civil and
ecclesiastical) among themselves, though extreemely corrupted and adulterate:
so long also as the Lord was pleading with them by his Prophets, calling them
to repentance, denouncing against them his judgments for their sins, etc. so
long Ephraim (the ten tribes figuratively so called) ceased not to be a
people; Esa. 7, 8. with Deu. 32, 21.21. Romans 20.19.
and the children of Israel were now beloved of the Lord, though as touching
themselves they were in apostasy and idolatry: Even like as a woman who is
beloved of her friend or husband, though she her self be an adulteress: As
the Scripture plainly teaches. Esa. 7.8. and Hos. 3, 1 -- 4. with 1, 2 -- 9.
and 2, 1, 2. etc. and 9, 3.12.15.17. Amos 3.1.2. with 1.1. and 2.4.6 -- 11. and
7.2.5.15.17. and 8.1 -- 5. Mic. 6.1.2. etc. with 2 Kin. 9.6. and 13, 23. and
the other Scriptures here before alleged concerning their estate.

Many other testimonies and arguments might be alleged to this purpose, out of
the Prophets and history of the Scriptures, to show the error and falsehood
of the aforesaid assertions, touching Israel, etc. But these for the present
may suffice. Now to come to the Scriptures which are here alleged by
themselves) more particularly: although their abuse thereof may sufficiently
appear by that which has been said, yet for more clearing of the matter, let
us now also insist upon those places, which (to bear out the former
assertions) they have here thus purpose^y and particularly joined together
themselves.

Touching 2 Chronicles. 15, 3.
The first place is 2 Chronicles. 15, 3. where 2 Chronicles. 15, 1.2.
Azariah the Prophet meeting Asa King of Judah, and all Judah and Benjamin with
him (as 2 Chr. 14 15. and 15.2.
they returned to Jerusalem from the war had with the Ethiopians) said unto
the^ 2 Chro. 15, 2 -- 7.
The Lord is with you, while ye be with him, and if ye seek him he will be
found of you: but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you: Now for a long
season Israel has been without the true God, and without a teaching Priest,
and without Law: But when they in their trouble did turn unto the Lord God
of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them: And in those days there was
no peace to him that went out, and to him that came in, but great vexations
were upon all the inhabitants of the countries: And nation was destroyed of
nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity: Be strong
therefore, and let not your hands be vveak: for your work shall be revvarded. 2
Chro. 15, 2 -- 7. Here the Prophet incourageth them in the work and service of
the Lord, and exhorts them to continue and go forvvard with the reformation
of Religion, which was already begun; whereof there is speech in the
chapter going before, where it is said, that 2 Chronicles. 14, 2 -- 5.
Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God. For
he took away the altars of the strange Gods, and the high places, and brake
down the images, and cut down the groves: and commanded Judah to seek the Lord
God of their Fathers, and to do the Law and the commandment. Also he took
away out of all the cities of Judah, the bye places and the images: and the
kingdom was quiet before him.

Now to encourage them to continue this reformation so well begun, the Prophet
uses diverse reasons, both in respect of things present, and things to come,
and things already past: and all of them in regard of the Lord himself, and his
dealing with them, according as they did or should walk with him: Touching
things present, because the Lord had now ^hevved himself to be with them, in
giving the^ deliverance from the Ethiopians, and victory over them, vvhiles
they were careful of reforming his worship: For the time to come, that if
they sought the Lord, putting trust in ^im, and being careful to worship him
according to his word, the Lord ^ould be found of them: but if they should
forsake him, declining to false vvor^hip, leaving of the reformation begun,
then he would forsake them, and leave ^^em in their dangers and misery. For
the time past, that Israel had been a ^^^ng season without the true God, and
without a teaching priest, and without law: etc. (...) which time no peace
but much anguish and trouble had been unto them. Which ^hether it be understood
of the ten tribes of Israel, or of Judah, or of (...) Israel together (as it
is by Lavate^, Strigelius, Piscator, etc. in 2 Chro. 15.
diverse diversely applied) yet it comes to ^^ke purpose for the point in hand;
showing how they neglected and left ^^f the true worship of God, and were then
by the Lord punished diverse ^aies.

If it be understood of the ten tribes (as well it may be) then we may apply
it to Ieroboams defection, and the estate of things among them from that time,
to the days of Asa here spoken off. For now they had left the Temple and true
worship of God, and follovved Ieroboams calves, and so are said to be See also
more hereafter, about the phrase of forsakeing the Lord, etc. p. 67, etc.
without the true God. Now likewise they had left the Lords Priests, that
were of Aarons line, and set them up Priests of the lowest of the people: and
were without a teaching priest, not having true doctrine soundly taught, nor
yet regarding it, and being without the sacrificers of the Lord. Now also
they had left the Law of the Lord, and follovved the commandment of the King,
and their own inventions, Hos. 5.11. and 13.2. and so are said to be without
Law. And thus applying it to the ten tribes of Israel, we may well understand
it of the defection of those times, when they left the true worship of God,
and follovved the calves at Dan and Bethel, etc.

If it be understood of Judah, (as some apply it, and the term By a Syneedoche.
Israel is sometimes put for Judah, 2 Chronicles. 12.1.4.5.6. and 21.2. etc.) then
it may be referred to the apostasy and false worship that had prevailed in
Judah, since Rehoboams time, in whose days Judah is said to have forsaken the
Lord and his law, and to have built by places, and images, and groves, etc. 2
Chro. 12.1, 2, 5. with 1 King. 14, 21 -- 24. The reformation whereof Asa had
now begun to make. As at other times also after this, the Lord complains of
Judah by the Prophet, saying, Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her
attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number. Ier. 2, 32.

If it be understood of all the tribes of Israel together (as some also apply
it, and so the word Israel is often used) then it may be referred to the
defection, and leaving of the true worship of God, so often mentioned in the
book of Judges as where it is said, that the children of Israel did evil in the
sight of the Lord, and forsook him, and served Baal and Ashtaroth, etc. Iud. 2,
11, 12, 13, etc.

And here (for the point in hand) note, that in the Scripture, by forsaking the
Lord, is often meant the leaving of his true worship and service, and the
follovving of idols and idolatry, etc. As when it is said, that the children
of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and forsook the Lord God of
their Fathers, there is further added this explication, that they served
Baalim, and follovved other Gods, of the Gods of the people that were round
about them, etc. Iud. 2, 11, 12.13.19.20. So also Rehoboam king of Judah, and
all Israel, are said to forsake the Lord, 2 Chr. 12, 5. that is, to forsake
the law of the Lord, 2 Chr. 12, 1. and to transgress against the Lord, ver.
2. provoking him to jelousy with their sins, and building the^ high places,
and images, and groves, etc. 1 King. 14, 21 -- 24. And thus the Lord long after
again complains of Judah by Jeremy, saying: My people have committed two
evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hevved them
out cisternes, broken cisternes that can hold no water. Ier. 2, 13. going
after Baalim, ver. 23, etc. making cakes to the Queen of of Heaven, and pouring
out drink offerings to other Gods, to provoke me to anger. Ier. 7, 18. and 44,
16, 19. And, I will set my judgments against them touching all their
wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burnt incense unto other Gods, and
vvorshiped the work of their own hands. Jer. 1, 16. And many the like
throughout the Scriptures, good to be observed thereabout. As, Judge. 10.6. 1 Samuel 8.8. and 12.10. 1 King. 9.9. and 11.33. and 18.18. 2 King. 21.21.22. and
22.17. 2 Chro. 7.22. and 21.10.11. and 24.18.20.24. and 29.6. and 34.25. Esa.
65.2 -- 11. Jer. 5.7.19. and 9.13.14. and 16.11, etc.

Which manner of speech with other the like in the Scripture is to be observed,
that we may aright understand these phrases, of forsaking the Lord, falling
and departing from the Lord, going a whoring from under the Lord, despising,
polluting, and forgetting the Lord, and other the like speeches, often spoken
touching the forsaking, despising, polluting, forgetting of the Law,
commandments, Temple, worship, and service of the Lord, etc. (as by the Judge
2, 12, 13. and 3, 7. 1 Samuel 15, 11. 1 King. 18, 18. 2 Chr. 12, 1, 5. and 24,
18, 20, 24. and 25, 27. and 29 6. Psalm. 106 20, 21, 39. Ezec. 23, 5. Ier. 2,
13. and 3, 20, 21. and 22 9. Ezec. 22 8. Mal. 1. 6, 7, 8. etc.
Scripture it self, and Chaldee Paraphrase, they are expounded usually:) and
not simply of so dealing with the Lord himself; as the bare words and letter
it self might seem to imply. For even in the defection of Israel, when
Jeroboam set up the calves, yet still they intended to worship the Lord that
brought them out of the Land of Egypt, as their Fathers had done of old in the
wilderness. 1 King. 12, 28. with Exo. 32, 4, 5, 8. And Naaman being healed by
Elisha (a 2 King. 5, 8.
Prophet in Israel) acknowledged the Lord God of Israel to be the only true
God. 2 Kin. 5, 15, etc. Iehu is anointed king over Israel, the people of the
Lord, 2 Kin. 9, 6. And has zeal for the Lord against Baal, 2 King. 10, 16.
and provideth for the servants of the Lord, when he slays the worshippers
of Baal, and destroys Baal out of Israel, 2 King. 10, 23 -- 28. Yet he
departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and took no heed
to walk in the Law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart. 2 King. 10,
29 -- 31. Likewise of Iehoahaz after him (when Israel was oppressed by the
Syrians) it is said that he besought the Lord, and the Lord hearkened unto him.
2 King. 13, 2, 3. And many the like may be observed about the ten tribes. And
much more concerning Judah, and all Israel together, in their corruptest
times: if it were needful to insist thereupon.

By this then may appear, that of whomsoever the Scripture aforesaid be
understood, yet it will not prove, that circumcision or the other ordinances of
God, had among the Jews (whether in Israel, or in Judah) were false and
deceitful signs, and no better then the abominations of the heathen, here
called by them, the ordinances of God retained in other nations. And if it
would, then it might be urged against Judah also, and not against Israel
only: as has been declared. And where then was circumcision, or the church of
God, if now they were not in Judah and Israel, nor among the Jews any more
then among the Gentiles?

But of this Scripture with other the like, and of the estate of Israel
diversely considered (sometimes in respect of themselves and their idolatry,
breaking the covenant on their part, and provooking the Lord unto wrath:
sometimes in respect of the Lord and his grace, not breaking the covenant on
his part, but calling them to repentance, etc.) I have spoken Adver. p. 60, 61.
etc.
othervvhere: which vvhiles they would oppugn, what other thing do they but
publish their own errors, contradictions, and abuse of Scriptures: as in some
particulars (about the former Objection) has been shevved before, and will
further appear by that which follows hereafter.

But now by this occasion, let me ask this touching themselves: If they would
that men should thus esteem of Isreal's sinful departing from Judah, as here
they write: how then would they have others to esteem, yea what do they
think themselves, of their own estate, in regard of their sinful division
made from the church whereof they were? Do they think that they also are fallen
from the Lord and from his church, etc. and that therefore the baptism and
other ordinances of God retained among them, are false and deceitful, and no
better then the observances of the heathen, etc. And whereas Arrow against
Idol. p. 71. etc.
they know that such have still some pretenses, which they are wont to allege
for the more coloring of their sinful iniquity: let them but see and
consider the things which themselves have observed heretofore, touching Arrow
against Idol. p. 71. etc.
Jeroboam, what he could pretend for himself and the cause of Israel
aforesaid: And let them make good use of it now for themselves.

Touching Ier. 3.8.
The next Scripture here cited by them, is Ier. 3.8. where Jeremy the Prophet
writes thus, Ier. 3, 6, 7, 8.
The Lord said also unto me in the days of Josiah the King, Have thou seen
that which backsliding Israel has done? She is gone up upon every high
mountain, and under every green tree, and there has played the Harlot. And I
said after she had done all these things: Turn thou unto me: but she turned
not, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it. And I saw, when for all the causes
whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery, I had put her away, and
given her a bill of divorce: yet her tretcherous sister Judah feared not, but
went and played the harlot also. Jer. 3, 6, 7, 8. Where note these things: 1.
That the Prophet spoke this in the days of Josiah, (as is said expressly,
ver. 6.) at which time Israel was now carried away captive out of their own
land into Assyria, some while before Iosiahs days, viz. in the sixth year of
Hezekiah, etc. 2 King. 18.9 -- 12. with 17 chap. So as this place is not to the
point of the question in hand: which is concerning the estate of Israel, from
Ieroboams time, all the while they abode in the land.

2. And what consequence is there in this, to say, Israel was put away, and had
a bill of divorce, in Iosiahs time, therefore it was so dealt with, in
Jeroboams time; when as Josiah was about two hundred years after Jeroboam? As
if one should say, 2 King. 24, 20, and 25, chap.
Judah was carried captive unto Babylon out of the Lords land and presence, in
Zedekiahs time, therefore they were so dealt with in Rehoboams time, whereas
Zedekiah the son of Josiah was above two hundred years after Rehoboam.

3. Nay this is directly against themselves. For seeing they were not put away,
nor had a byll of divorce, so long as they dwelt in the Lords land of Canaan;
therefore their case was, and is otherwise to be esteemed, all that time, then
as these men in their prejudicate conceit, for more color ^f their errors,
would bear us in hand.

4. By this place also compared with Hos. 9, 3.15, 17. 2 Kin. 13, 23.
other places of the Prophets) ^ay appear that by the byll of divorce, given
unto them, is meant, the put^ng of them out of the land of Canaan; (as out of
the Lords house and presence) and delivering them unto the Kings of Assyria to
be carried thither. To which purpose may be observed, how a woman divorced or
put away, is termed; one that is cast out, or thrust forth, to wit, out of her
husbands house. Ezec. 44, 22. Thus Basting. Comment. in Catechis. quest. 85. at
the end thereof.
some also think that excommunicates who are cast out of the church, and so out
of the house of God, may after a sort be said (for the time of their so
abiding) to have a bil of divorce. And all know, that such are to be accounted
members of the church (though in sin) all the while their cause is a pleading,
til they be proceeded withal, and cast out of the church: and that then also
they are not to be esteemed, as put out of the covenant of the Lord: but from
his house and family, till they repent: so as upon repentance they may and
ought to be received again into the Lords house, and admitted to the churches
communion, as before. And this, without any new baptizing of them again: which
yet should be, if they had be^ put out of the covenant of the Lord. For
baptism is the sign of our entrance thereinto, and the Lords seal of his so
receiving and admitting of us: as circumcision was to the Jews of old.
Likewise when Judah was cast ou- of the land, and carried away captive to
Babylon (as God said to Jeremy, concerning them, Ier. 15, 1
Cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth) and then after seventy
years, Ier. 29, 10. Ezr. 1, 1. etc.
according to Ieremies prophecy also returned again into the land: they were
not circumcised anew: neither had the Lord put them out of his covenant;
though they had broken the Lords covenant themselves, and were therefore thus
chastised by him. According as Jeremy in another place faith expressly, Jer.
51, 5.
Israel has not ben Forsaken as a widovv.
forsaken nor Judah of his God, of the Lord of hosts: though their land was
filled with sin against the Holy one of Israel. Ier. 51.5. Which is the more
to be observed, considering the time when Jeremy prophesied (here spoken of
before) and the sundry things that here he speaks, both of Judah and
Israel. Jer. 50, 4, 5, 17, 18, 19, 20, 33, 34. and 51, 5, 19. with 10, 16. and
3, 6 -- 25. Which being duly considered, will meet with diverse erroneous
opinions that are conceived hereabout: and will show that the Lord was so far
himself from breaking his covenant with them on his part, as still from time
to time he called them to repentance, by his Prophets and by his corrections
and chastisements, and even in this very thing (when at the last he put the^
out of his land) avenged the quarrel of his covenant upon them: as he had long
before threatened by Moses against them. Lev. 26, 25.

5. Moreover in the Ier. 3, 3.
same verse (here cited by themselves, Jeremy ^heweth, that when for all the
causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery, the Lord had put her
away, and given her a bill of divorce: yet her treacherous sister Judah feared
not, but played the harlot also: so speaking of the idolatries of Judah, ^ery
often and particularly, both in this chapter, and throughout his prophecy: As
when he says that Jer. 3, 3.
she had an whores forehead, and refused to be ashamed: Yea that ver. 11.
the Lord said unto him, concerning her expressly, The backsliding Israel
has justified her self more then tretcherous Judah. Of whom also he
testifies, that they forsook the Lord, and burnt incense to other Gods, and
worshipped the works of their own hands. Jer. 1, 15, 16. and 2, 13, 18. Saying
to a stock, Thou art my Father; and to a stone, Thou have brought me forth. v.
28. And according to the number of thy cities, are thy Gods, O Judah. ver. 29.
Yea in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, the children
gather vvood, and the Fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough
to make cakes to the Queen of heaven, and to power out drink offerings to
other Gods, that they may provoke the Lord to anger. Ier. 7, 17, 18. and 44, 15
-- 19. They have forsaken me (says the Lord) and have estraunged this place,
and have burnt incense in it unto other Gods, whom neither they nor their
fathers have known, nor the Kings of Judah, and have filled this place with
the blood of innocents: They have built also the high, places of Baal, to burn
their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not,
nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind. Jer. 19, 4, 5. A conspiracy is
found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem: They are
turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my
words: and the^ went after other Gods to serve them: the house of Israel, and
the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers
Jer. 11, 9, 10. Shall we now therefore say of Judah, (as these men do (...)
Israel) that the Lord was not their God, nor they his people; that th^^ Lord
brake the covenant on his part also with them; that circumcision and the other
ordinances of God retained in Judah, were not the Lord signs, nor his seals
of the forgiveness of sin, but that they were in their use o^ them, false and
deceitful: and no better then the ordinances of worship had among the
heathen. Then the Prophet Jer. 1, 1, 2, 3, 16. and 2, 2, 28.
Jeremy himself, and Zeph. 1, ^, 4. etc.
Zephani^ who prophesied at the same time, against their corruptions; Esa. 1,
1, 11, 29 and 2, 6, 8. and 57, 3, 4, 5.
Esaias all and Mic. 1, 1, 5, 9, 13. and 5, 13, 14. and 6, 16.
Micah, who prophesied before against their idolatries; and all the Esa. 8, 16,
17, 18. and 66, 5. Jer. 26, 17-20. and 35, 2. and 36, 4, 12, 19. and 40, 5, 6
and 51, 59, 61.
godly that were with them in those days members of that church had not the
Lords sign of circumcision, nor his seal of forgiveness e^ sins, and of life
eternal, nor any other ordinances of God, but such a^ in their use were false
and deceitful: and no better then the abomina^^ons of the heathen. Let him
that reads consider, how ungodly and erroneous these opinions and assertions
are.

6. And observe also, how they shuffle together both Scriptures an^ matters,
that are clean differing one from another, touching the poi^^^ in question.
The other Scripture, which here they cited before, our o^ 2 Chro. 15, 3. was
spoken 2 Chr. 15 1, 2. 1 Chr 3, 10.
in Asaes time, who was the 2 Chronicles. 12, 16. and 14, 1.
third king from R^hoboam (in 2 Ch^on. 10 chap. ^ 1 Kin. 12.
whose days the division was made by Jeroboam) af^^^ which time, 2 Kin. 17
and 18, 9, 10, 11.12.
Israel had no bill of divorce, nor was put away, of a lo^^ time, but abode
in the land about two hundred years after: as appears plainly by the
history. But this Scripture which they join vvith^^ ^ut of Jer. 3.8. was
spoken in Ier. 3, 6.
Josiahs time, the 1 Chr. 3, 10, 14.
fifteenth King from Re^oboam aforesaid: who reigned 1 Kin. 14.21 -- 2 Kin. 22,
1.
about three hundred year after him. At which time Israel was put out of
the land of Canaan, and carried away into Assyria (a Amo. ^.17.
polluted land:) and so had the bill of divorce here ^poken off. (Which fell
out 2 Kin. 18 10, 11.
in the sixth year of Hezekiahs reign, as I no^ed before:) Which times and
cases therefore, how far they differ one from another (and so from the point in
hand) who is there that cannot observe?

7. Finally, here might further be considered, how in this chapter also, the
Lord bids Jeremy Ier. 3, 12, 13, 14.
go and proclaim these words toward the North, and ^ay, Return thou
backsliding Israel, says the Lord, and I will not cause mine anger to fall
upon you: for I am merciful; says the Lord, and I will not keep anger for
ever: Only acknovvledge thine iniquity that thou have transgressed against
the Lord thy God, and have scattered thy ways to the strangers under every
green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, says the Lord: Turn, O
backsliding children, says the Lord, for I am married unto you: and I will take
you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion. Ier. 3,
12, 13, 14. Where diverse things about the points in question might be observed,
if I would stand thereon. As namely: First, that the Lord here bids the
Prophet Jeremy, Go and proclaim these words toward the North, that is,
toward 2 King. 17, 6.
Assyria and the land of the Medes, vvhither Israel was now carried away out of
the Land of Canaan. 2. Secondly, that he should call them to repentance,
saying, Return thou back sliding Israel, says the Lord, etc. and so promise
them mercy in the name of the Lord, saying, I vvil not cause mine anger to fall
upon you, etc. which shows that the Lord had not dealt with them as they
deserved, ^ut could yet make his anger fall more upon them, if he were not
merci^^ll and one that kept not anger for ever: And that he dealt otherwise
herein then a man does with his wife, whom he puts away, and she becomes
another man's: as he showed before in Ier. 3, 1.
this chapter. Thirdly, that he says here to Israel, Only acknowledge thine
iniquity that thou have transgressed against the Lord ^y God, etc. as in the
other chapter before Ier. 2, 2, 19.
he said to Judah: Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy back
slidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see, that it is an evil thing
and bitter, that thou have forsaken the Lord thy God. etc. where those words,
the Lord thy God, Genesis 17, ^
are words of the covenant.

Fourthly and specially, that he says, Turn O back sliding Israel, says the
lord, for I am married unto you, etc. Piscator, Calvin. etc
Which marriage the best writers upon this ^^ace, expound also of the Lords
covenant of grace. 5. And finally, that ^^e Lord would take them, one of a
city, and two of a family, and bring them to Zi^^^, etc. So teaching (as
Calvin in Jer. 3, 14.
one well notes upon this place) that in their ^irning to God, they should
not stay one for another; and that though ^^e body of the people should remain
obstinate, yet if a few returned to ^^e Lord, he would be ready to receive
them. Which shows the stabi^^tie and eternity of the Lords covenant: as he
spoke to Abraham, both ^^r him, and his seed, in their generations: Genesis 17, 7.
And that the Lord ^^membreth and performs his covenant, if but a few be made
partakers of that grace: as Paul also shows, Romans (...) may ^^^^vvise teach
us, in our coming to the Lord, and yielding obedience to his word, not to
depend upon the multitude, nor to stand looking and waiting one for another,
but readily to follow the Lords calling; as in another case, Christ spoke unto
Peter. Joh. 21, 20, 21, 22. These and other like things might here be observed.
But they are not the things that I purpose to insist upon, because this point
concerns the case of Israel, being now put out of the land of Canaan, and
carried away into Assyria: whereas our question is of the estate of Israel, in
their defection, from the time of Jeroboam that set up the calves, and so
forvvard, vvhiles yet they were not put away, but remained in the land of
Cannaan. By which all may see, that this Scripture here cited by them, is
vainly alleged, being not to the purpose and question in controversy.

Yet notwithstanding having this occasion, I think it not amiss about this
matter here to annexe two things further to be considered off: the one
concerning Israel, the other concerning Judah. As touching Israel, that
whereas they were now put out of Canaan, and carried away into Assyria, and
placed in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the
Medes, as is recorded, 2 King. 17, 6. there is particular and express mention
(among the places whither they were carried) of the cities of the Medes.
Wherevvith if we compare the Acts of the Apostles, we shall find also particular
mention, how when the holy Ghost came upon the Apostles at the feast of
Pentecost, after Christ's ascension, and they spoke with toungues to the Jews
that were now at Jerusalem, of all nations under heaven, to every one in their
own toungue; that among the rest, there were also Medes, Act. 2, 9. Which is
the more to be observed, first because this is one of the places before
mentioned, vvhither Israel was carried away by the king of Assyria, when God
put them out of his land. 2 Kin. 17, 6. Secondly, because Peter now speaking
unto these with the rest, says unto them as to the rest, the promise is made
unto you, and to your children, etc. Act. 2, 9 -- 39. like as also upon another
occasion, straightway after speaking to the Jews in the Temple, he says unto
them, Ye are the children of the Prophets, and of the covenant which God made
with our Fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the kinreds
of the earth be blessed. Unto you first, God having raised up his son Jesus,
sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.
Act. 3, 25, 26. Thus shevving that God still remembered and regarded his
covenant tovvard them, and how the grace and benefit thereof was extended unto
them in Christ. Now whereas it is said, there were dwelling at Jerusalem,
Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven: Act. 2.5. least any
should understand it only of such as had their seated abode and dwelling
there, as the word othervvhere is used: M. Beza therefore notes here, ^^z. ^^
Act. 2.^.
that in this place the dwellers seem generally to be said any strangers that
were at this time at Jerusalem: so as it may comprehend, not only the
strangers that had their seated dwelling there, but such also as for study or
learning of religion sojourned there for a time, and those moreover that out of
sundry nations came thither to ^^e feast. For now it was the feast of
Pentecost, Act. 2, 1. To which pur^ose also may be observed, how the Arabik
translation here has it thus: ^ow there were men abiding in the holy place
(that is in Jerusalem) that feared ^od, Jews, and of al people that were
under heaven. Act. 2, 5. as also that the text ^ayth, they all heard them
speak, every man in his own tongue, wherein they were ^orne. Act. 2, 8 -- 11.
among whom were the Medes, as is aforesaid. Act. 2, 9.

As touching Judah, the Prophet Jeremy and the history show how ^^ey also
for their idolatry, backsliding, and other sins, were cast out of ^^e Lords
sight and presence, when they were carried into captivity out of the and of
Canaan, Jer. 15, 1, 2. 2 King. 24, 20. and 25 chap. And Esaias speaking of Gods
favor after his punishing of them says, Thou shall forget the shame of ^^y
youth (the opprobry suffered of the Egyptians, when they kept thee in ^^ard
bondage) and shall not any more remember the reproach of thy vvidowhood which
thou undergoes in the servitude and captivity of Babylon.) For ^^y maker is
(or, will be) thy husband, the Lord of Hosts is his name, and thy redeemer ^^e
Holy one of Israel, the God of the whole earth shall he be called. For the
Lord has ^^lled (or will call) thee as a woman forsaken, and grieved in
spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou vvast refused, says thy God. For a
small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercyes vvil I gather thee.
etc. Esa. 54, 4 -- 7. And again he says: Thou ^alt no more be termed,
Forsaken, neither shall thy land any more be termed, Deso^^te: but thou shall
be called, Hephzi-bah (my delight is in her) and thy land, ^^eulah (married:)
for the Lord deliteth in thee, and thy land shall be married. For as a ^^ung man
marieth a virgin, so shall As a la^d becoming destitute of her inhabitants, may
be said to be a widow: so again a land replenished with her inhabitants may be
said to be married.
thy sons marry thee: and as the bridegroom re^^yceth over the bride, so
shall thy God rejoice over thee. Esa. 62, 4, 5. Where note, ^ovv Judah, being
carried into captivity, and shut up in exile for a time, (...) said, to be cast
out of Gods sight, and counted a widow, refused, forsaken, deso^^te,
unmaried, etc. As Shemajah the Prophet, said of old to Rehoboam and ^^e Princes
of Judah, when they forsook the law of the Lord, Thus says ^^e Lord, ye have
forsaken (or left) me: and therefore have I also forsaken (or left) ^^u in the
hand of Shishak, king of Egypt. 2 Chronicles. 12, 1, 5. and as Zechariah likewise,
when wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem, because they served ^^oues and
idols, said unto them, Why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord, ^^at
ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the Lord, he has also forsaken
you. 2 Chronicles. 24, 17 -- 20. By which Scriptures compared together, we may
learn how to understand, those speeches, of being a Widovv, refused,
forsaken, cast out of Gods sight, etc. in regard of their being put out of the
land of Canaan, given up into their enemies hand, carried into captivity,
deteyned in exile, and so exposed to manifold calamities, justly inflicted and
^^^ought upon them, for their idolatry and other transgressions. For otherwise
it is true, which is also said by Jeremiah the Prophet, that Israel has ^^t
ben forsaken (as a vvidow) nor Judah of his God, of the Lord of hosts: though
^^eir land was filled with vvasting from the Holy one of Israel. Ier. 51, 5.
So in one ^^spect they were forsaken, and bare the reproach of vvidowhood, when
for ^^eir sins God put them out of his land, and delivered them into the
^ands of their enemies, to be their captives and exiles: and in another respect
they were not forsaken as a widow of the Lord, who yet remembered his
gracious covenant, to show them mercy accordingly. And thus both are true,
being rightly understood.

Which Ezechiell also makes plain in his prophecy, Chapter 16, and 20, and 23.
Some particulars whereof (because they give great light about the estate of
Israel and Judah, and Gods dealing with them) I will therefore here set
down: Ezec. 23, 1 2, 3, 4, etc.
yet vvishing the Reader to peruse the whole Chapters, and to observe them
well. The word of the Lord (says Ezechiell, when he prophesied against the
Jews that yet remained in the Land, in the time of king Zedechiah) came unto
me, saying: Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:
And they committed whoredom in Egypt, they committed whoredom in their youth:
there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their
virginity. And the names of them were Israel.
Aholah the elder, and Judah.
Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters:
thus were their names, Samaria is That is, her own tent.
Aholah, and Jerusalem That is, my tent in her.
Aholibah. And Aholah played the harlot Hebr. Under me. As Number. 5, 19, 20.
when she was mine, and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her
neighbors, etc. Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt, etc.
Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her Lovers, into the hand of
the Assyrians, upon whom she doted, etc. Ezec. 23, 1 -- 10 And when her sister
Judah. v. 22.
Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love then she, and
in her vvhoredomes more then her sister in her whoredoms. She doted upon the
Assyrians her neighbors, etc. The I saw that she was defiled, that they took
both one way: and that she increased her whoredoms, etc. then my mind was
alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister. Yet she
multiplied her whoredoms, etc. Therefore, O Aholibah, thus says the Lord God,
Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is
alienated and I will bring them against thee on every side; the Babylonians
and al^^ the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoah, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with
the^. etc. And I will set my jelousie against thee, v. 25. M. Junius calls
this a divorce in his Commentar. on Ezech. 23.25.28. v. 30.
and they shall deal furiously with thee; they shall take away thy nose and
thine ears, and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons
and thy daughters, and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire: they shall
also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair Jewels, etc. For
thus says the Lord God, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou
hate, etc. and the^ shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away
all thy labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare, and the nakedness of thy
whoredom shall be discovered, both thy levvdnes and thy vvhoredomes. I will
do these things unto thee, because thou have gone a whoring after the Heathen,
v. 31. v. 35.
because thou art polluted with their idols. Thou have vvalked in the way of
thy sister, therefore will I give her cup into thy hand. etc. Therefore thus
says the Lord God, Because thou have forgotten me, and cast me behind thy
back, therefore bear thou also thy levvdnes, and thy whoredoms. v. 36.
The Lord said moreover unto me, Son of man, will thou Or plead for, defend,
excuse, etc.
judge judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea declare unto them their abominati^^s:
that they have committed adultery, v. 37. v. 38.
and blood is in their hands, and ^ith their idols have they committed
adultery, and have also caused their ^onnes, whom they bare unto me, to pass
for them through the fire to ^evoure them. Moreover this they have done unto
me, they have defiled ^^y Sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my
Sabbaths, etc. Then ^^id I unto her that was old in adulteries, v. 43.
Will they now commit vvhore^omes with her, and she with them. Yet they went
in unto her, as they ^oe in unto a woman that plays the harlot: v. 44. v. 45.
so went they in unto Aho^^h and unto Aholibah the lewd women. And the
righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after
the manner of women that shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood
is in their hands. For thus says the Lord God, v. 46.
I will bring a company upon ^^em, and will give them to be removed and
spoiled, etc. Eze. 23, 11 -- 47, etc. ^itherto Ezekiel the Prophet. Where now
again I might ask of these ^^en, whether they think of Judah in this estate,
as they do of Israel, that ^^e Lord was not the God of Judah, nor they his
church and people; that the covenant now was broken as well on the Lords part,
as on theirs; and that circumcision retained among them, was not the Lords
sign and ^oly institution, but a lying sign, a cursed and detestable
sacrament, false and deceitful in their use, and no better then the heathens
superstiti^^ns, etc. But I will leave these things to be pondered by the
discreet Rea^er: and will not still mention and infer them, as I might
almost upon every verse.

Also in the 20 chap. of Ezechiell (when certain of the Elders of Israel came
to the Prophet, Ezech. 20.
to inquire of the Lord, etc.) after declaration of the Jews former idolatries
and rebellions. ver. 5.
in Egypt; ver 10.
in the wilderness; and in (...) the land of Canaan: ver. 27.
the Lord then speaks thus unto them ver. 33. v. 35.
As I live ^^th the Lord God, Surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched
out ^^me, and with fury powered out, will I rule over you, etc. And I will
^ring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with ^^u
face to face. Like as I pleaded in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, v. 36.
v. 37. v. 38.
so vvil I plead with you, says the Lord God. And I will cause you to pass
under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant. And I will
purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I
will bring them forth out of the country where they so^^urne, and they shall
not enter into the land of Israel, and ye shall know that I am the Lord. As for
you, O house of Israel, v. 39.
thus says the Lord ^od, Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter
also, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye mine holy Name no more
with your gifts, and with your Idols. etc. Ezech. 20, 1 -- 39. etc.

And in the 16 chap. the same Prophet also vvriteth thus. Ezec. 16. ver. 1. v.
2. v. 3.
The word of the ^^rd came unto me saying: Son of man, cause Jerusalem to
know her abominations, and (...), Thus says the Lord God unto Jerusalem; Thy
birth and thy nativi^^^ is of the land of Canaan, thy father was an Amorite,
and thy mother an Hittite. v. 4.
And as for thy nativitie in the day that thou wast borne, thy navel was not
cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee, etc. And so the Prophet
proceeding, shows first v. 3, 4, 5.
the miserable estate of Jerusalem in the Jews themselves, together with v.
1 -- 14
Gods special love declared unto them; and then ver. 15. etc.
"her abominable whoredom and other finnes, matching v. 44, 45.
her mother, and exceeding v. r. 46, etc.
her sisters, Sodom and Samaria, together with v. 36-58.
her heavy judgment thereupon: and so finally in the end makes this
conclusion, saying: Eze. 16. ver. 59.
Thus says the Lord God, I will even deal with thee as thou have done, which
have despised the oath in breaking the covenant. Nevertheless I will remember
my Covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto
thee an everlasting covenant. Then thou shall remember thy ways and be
ashamed, when thou shall receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger, and
I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy Covenant. And I will
establish my covenant with thee, and thou shall know that I am the Lord: That
thou may remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more:
because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee, for all that thou have
done, says the Lord God. Ezec. 16 chap. And hitherto of these things in
Ezechiell the Prophet: of which sort he has many the like.

Psa. 74, and 79, and 80. etc.
Wherevvith also agrees that which is written in diverse of the Psalms
hereabout. And namely, in the 89 Psalm, which (as some other of the Psalms)
treats of the time and estate of the Jews in the captivity of Babylon.
Where Psalm. 89.
the Prophet speaking of the stability of Gods covenant and promise made unto
David, and of the eternity of his seed and kingdom; and therevvithall annexing
a denunciation of judgment upon the transgressors of the covenant: the Psalm
then (speaking in the person of the Lord) sings it thus: Psalm. 89.28 -- 34.
My mercy will I keep for him for evermore and my covenant shall stand fast
with him. His seed also vvil I make to endure for ever and his throne as the
days of heaven. If his children forsake my Law, and walk in my judgments:
If they Hebr. profane.
break my Statutes and keep not my Commandments. Then will I visit their
transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless my
loving kindness will I not utterly take from him: nor suffer my faithful^^^ to
fail. My covenant will I not Hebr. profane.
break; nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. etc. Psalm. 89, 28 --
34. etc.

Now how plainly these Scriptures lead us, to observe a double consideration of
the Jews and people of God, in cases of apostasy (as I have Advert. p. 59.
60. 61. etc.
other where in some particulars noted heretofore) One in respect of themselves
another in respect of the Lord: One, in respect of the covenant which the^^
sinfully break on their part; another, in respect of the covenant which the
Lord faithfully keeps on his part: One, in respect of the covenant (...)
works; another, in respect of the covenant of grace: One, in respect o^ the
truths and favors of God still enjoyed among the^; another in respect of their
transgressions and mixture of their own inventions and profanat^ons vvithall,
etc. I will not here further prosecute, but leave it to the consideration and
judgment of others: Wishing al such as have opposed or ha^ ^rejudice hereabout,
now carefully to observe and regard these things; ^east otherwise they run
into error upon error more and more, de^eiving and being deceived, and so
receive from the Lord a just recom^ence of their obstinacy and opposition.

How also some of the Scriptures aforesaid, may vvithall have reference to the
calling again of the Jews (now to come) I will not here ^nter to speak
thereof: but will keep to the question in hand, concerning ^he estate of
Israel in defection, from Ieroboams time and forvvard, so long ^s God let them
remain in his land, the land of Canaan, the land of promise, etc. All which
time both Israel and Judah were still by the Prophets ^alled and accounted the
people of the Lord, and have such duties required of them, such reproofs and
exhortations given them, and such things done for them and concerning them, as
belong particularly to such as are the church and covenanted people of God. As
I have by sun^ry instances here before showed out of the Prophets and history
of the ^cripture: which I need not again to repeat. P. 58. etc.
And hitherto concerning ^er. 3, 8.

Touching Hos. 2.2.
The next Scripture here alleged, is Hos. 2.2. which for sundry questions
touching churches in apostasy may well be observed: so it be rightly done. The
words are these, Hos. 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Say ye unto your brethren, That is my people.
Ammi,, and to your sisters, That is, having obteyced mercy.
Ruhamah. Plead with your mother, plead; Or, that she is not.
for she is not my wife, nor I her ^usband: Or, that she put away.
let her therefore put away her vvhoredomes out of her sight, and her
adulteries from betvveen her breasts, Least I strip her naked, and st her as in
the day that she was borne, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a
dry land, and slay her with thirst. And I will not have mercy upon her
children, for they be the children of whoredoms. For their mother has played
the harlot: she that conceived them has done shamefully: for she said, I will
go after my lovers that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax,
mine oil and my drink. etc. To find out the meaning ^hereof the better, let
us consider, both what went before, and what follows after in this Prophecy
it self; and what further light other Scriptures compared herevvith will
afford hereabout. First therefore (to begin with that which goes before in
this prophecy) observe and remember still the time when Hosea prophesied:
which was Hos. 1, ^.
in the days of Vzziah; ^otham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah kings of Judah, and in the
days of Jeroboam the son of ^oash king of Israel: who was the thirteenth
king after Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that caused Israel to sin.

Next, mark how the Lord now said to Hoseah the Prophet, Hos. 1, ^.
Go, take thee a wife of whoredoms, and children of whoredoms: for the land
(of Israel) has committed great whoredom, departing from the Lord: And how
the Prophet went and did it Hos. 1.3. etc.

That this is a type of Isreal's estate in Hoseahs time, none will deny. And that
here Israel is expressly termed a wife, is evident, though yet a wife of
whoredoms in that their estate. Now the Lord then threatnerh for this
spiritual whoredom of their idolatry and sinful iniquities, to punish and
cast the^ away. And this also (to be done by degrees, if any way they could be
brought to repentance) is declared by tipes of the children borne by this wife
the harlot one after another. Whereof the first was called Hos. 1, 4.
Jezreel, according to the name of a town in Israel because the calamity now
prophesied of Israel should begin when Zachariah (the fourth from Iehu) should
be slain by Shallum, and so the kingdom be taken away from Iehues house, for
the slaughters that he made 2 Kin. 9. and 10 chapter
before in Iezreel, Hos. 1, 4, 5. The acco^plishment whereof, see in 2 Kin. 15,
8 -- 12. And this fell out after the time of Jeroboam the son of Ioash (the
third from Iehu:) in whose days, Hoseah began to prophecy: as I noted before,
Hos. 1, 1. with 2 King. 14, 23, 29. and 15, 8. etc. So this was not yet
performed, when Hoseah thus prophesied: but it was then to come.

The second child which was conceived and borne by this wife, was called Hos.
1.6.
Lo-ruhamah (that is, not having obtained mercy) noting that calamity which
came upon Israel, when in the days of Pekah king of Israel Tiglath Pileser
King of Assyria came and wasted the country beyond Jordan, carrying away the
Rubenites, Gadites, and half tribe of Manasseh, 1 Chronicles. 5, 26. and took Iion,
and Abel-beth-maachah, and Ianoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and
Galile, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria. 2 King.
15, 29. with Hos. 1, 6. And this also was then to come, when Hoseah thus
prophesied.

The third child, borne by this wife was called, Hos. 1, 9.
Lo-ammi (that is, not my people) noting the third and great calamity, which
came in the days of Hoseah the last king of Israel, when the whole kingdom of
the ten tribes was overthrovvne by Salmanasser, king of Assyria, and the
Israelites cast out of the Lords land, and scattered among the nations, as if
they were not the Lords people, but accounted as the Gentiles. 2 King. 17, 3
-- 6. etc. with Hos. 1, 9. And this likewise was yet to come, when Hosea thus
prophesied thereof.

Now the first chapter having these types and prophecies, we may observe Hos.
2. chapter
the second chapter accordingly to have the application thereof especially of
the last of them, to the estate of Israel. In the former part of which chapter
there is a denunciation, of the rejection of Israel, and of casting of them
out of the land, with other afflictions accompanying the same: because of
their spiritual adultery and idolatry. Which is set down by similitude of
the divorce of an adulteress woman (so to call it, as Pis^ator. Anal. ^n Hos
2, etc.
some vvriters do:) a divorce, I say, whereby an adulteress is put out of
her husbands house, and deprived of the benefits which formerly she enjoyed
therein: whereof many particulars be here mentioned: as now by the Prophet
they were threatened against them.

So then the wife of whoredoms (spoken of chap. 1, 2.) is the Congregation of
Israel, the mother (spoken of chap. 2.2. to whom the Lord would not now be
an husband to protect her, because she was not a loyal wife but ^
played the harlot. Thus now she is a wife, and not a wife. She is wife, but
a wife of whoredoms, Hos. 1, 2. She is not a wife, that does de^eane her self
loyally as she should, but has her adulteries between her ^^rests. Hos. 2, 2.

To which purpose also may be observed, that the Lord vouchsafes ^et Hos. 2,
2.
to plead with her, as with Chapter 1, 2.
a wife of whoredoms; to exhort and require ^er to Chapter 2, 2.
put away her whoredoms out of her sight, etc. to threaten her (as he did
Judah also) that else v. 3, etc.
he vvil strip her naked, Ezec. 23, 25, 26, 29, etc.
and set her as in the day that she was ^orne, that is, deprive her wholly of
her ornaments and blessings (so then they were not yet all taken away:) and
that he would bring her into as miserable estate, as when she was in bondage in
Egypt: at which time, in the midst of all her misery, he took pity on her,
and made her his wife: and endewed her with many excellent gifts and
blessings; and brought her into the land of Canaan, and into his house and
dwelling place: Out of which now he would thrust her again, and deprive her
of all his mercies and blessings there enjoyed. Hos. 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13. with Ezec. 16, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. etc. Now this being but threatened here, was
not yet performed* And difference is to be put betvveen a threatening (as here
is made) and the performance or execution thereof: which followed after. As we
have ^hewed here before, out of the history: 2 King. 17 chap. Else men might
al^^ think that Judah was not the wife of God, nor he her husband, in Ezechiels
time: by whom the Lord calls her an harlot, and more corrupt in whoredoms
then Israel, and threatens against her (as here he does by Hoseah against
Israel) that he will strip her out of her clothes and take away her fair
jewels, and leave her naked and bare: etc. Ezec. 16, 35-59. ^^d 23, 4, 11, 26,
29, 36, 44, 45. with Hos. 1, 2. and 2, 2, 3. Or if we should here understand it
otherwise, yet this still is evident, that the Prophet Hos. 1, 9. with chapter 2
and 3, and 9, etc.
first speaks of the birth of Lo-ammi (not my people) Hos. 1, 9. before he
says, Plead with your mother, that she is not my wife, nor I her husband; that
she put away her whoredoms, least I strip her naked, etc. Hos. 2, 2, 3. etc.
And both by the prophecy and history appears (as is showed before) that the
time and estate of this Lo-ammi, was yet to come: it typing out that time and
calamity of theirs, when the Lord drove them out of his house, and cast them
out of his land, and gave them up into the hands of Salmanasser and Esar^addon
kings of Assyria, when now their kingdom was quite over^^rowne, and themselves
captived and carried away out of Canaan (the ^and of promise) into the polluted
lands of the heathen nations, etc. So as ^is then touches not the question it
self, which is concerning the estate of Israel, vvhiles they remained in the
land, being now fallen into defe^^^on, as is aforesaid.

Some (I know) there are, who take it, that Hierom. Zanchius, Mercerus, etc.
on Hos. 1. etc.
by Iezreel (the first child ^^re spoken off) is meant, the captivity brought
upon part of the ten ^^bes, by Tiglath Pileser aforesaid: and by Lo-ruhamah
(the second child) ^^e captivity of all the ten tribes by Salmanasser: and by
Lo-ammi (the ^^ird child) that estate of theirs, when being thus punished, and
not yet ^^^enting, they were in the end rejected from being the people of God,
and accounted as the Gentiles, among whom they were vvanderers. Or that by
Jezreel (the first child) was meant the captivity of the ten tribes by
Salmanassar aforesaid, when they were carried out of their land, and dispersed
among the nations: and by Lo-ruchamah, their estate afterwaad in captivity,
when they found not mercy with the Lord, which yet he would have showed unto
them, if they had repented and turned unto him: and by Lo-ammi, that time and
estate of theirs, when after all the former punishments, and forbearance of the
Lord, they not yet repenting, were now no longer accounted his people, but
rejected and esteemed as the heathen: And accordingly they make this second
chapter (vvhereabout we treat) an explication of that which went before in
the first chapter: And so apply it now also to the estate of the Jews
generally, since their refusal of Christ and his Gospel. Which then is the
more against these men: and still shows that this perteynes not to the
question in controversy, concerning Isreal's estate, before their dispersion,
vvhiles yet they were in the land of Canaan, and not made wanderers among the
Gentiles.

Now to come to such things, as follow after in this prophecy; I could here at
first insist upon the very next words, in Hos. 2, 2.3. etc.
this verse, and the verses follovving: let her therefore put away her
whoredoms out of her sight, least I strip her naked, and set her as in the day
that she was borne, etc. Which plainly shows, that she was not yet brought
to this pass, but was thus threatened, to bring her to repentance, or leave her
the more without excuse: as in such pleading and dealing is commonly used:
like as I noted here before touching Judah also, out of Ezec. 16, and 20, and
23 chap. I could moreover out of this chapter it self, compare with Hos. 2.2,
with v. 13 and. 16.
this verse, that which is written in the 13 and 16 verses follovving. where
it is said, I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, etc. Hos. 2, 13. And it
shall be at that day, says the Lord, that thou shall (...) me Isht, and shall
call me no more Baali. For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her
mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name. Hos. 2, 16, 17. and
so comparing these together, leave it to the Reader, to consider whether the
meaning here may not be this (agreeable to some things aforesaid:) Plead with
your mother, that she is not Ishti, my wife, and that I am not Isha, her
husband: because she calls me not Ishi, my husband, that is, does not
worship me synceerly without mixture of Idolatry, as she should, and as I her
husband have appointed her to do: but calls me Baali, my Lord, that is, Like
as now the Papists worship God in and by their images, etc.
worshippeth me as her Lord or husband in and by Baal, and such like Idols, etc
From which how ever she will not be drawn, vvhiles she remains i^ this
estate: yet I shall hereafter cause her to leave it, and to cleave unto me and
serve me in sincerity, when I shall by corrections and by my word and spirit
bring her to repentance and amendment. Hos. 2, 2. vvi^^ ver. 13 -- 16. etc.
Where note, that the word Baali is in it self ^xo. 21, 3 De^. 24.4. 2 (...).
21, 26 (where ^^th Jo^ and Baal is ^sed to note out the (...) and) (...)
3^.23. (...) 8.
a good term (signifying my Lord, or, my husband:) but because it was a
word, not kep^ peculiar to husbands, but made common to Idols, unto which it
was apply I and abused in Idolatry, therefore would not the Lord so be
called nor so be worshipped with a mixed and adulterate kind of service and
^orship, etc. Neither does the Lord blame and punish this only in Is^^ell,
but in Judah also, and all the tribes together: who were likewise ^uilty of
the same transgression, of worshipping Baal, as Israel was. As ^ay be seen
throughout the Scriptures: Iud. 2, 13. and 8, 33. 2 King. 21, 3. ^ Chron. 24,
7. and 28, 2. Ier. 2, 2, 8, 23. and 7, 9. and 9, 14. and 11, 13, 17. and 19, 5.
^^d 23, 13, 27. and 32, 29, 35. Zeph. 1, 4. Of these things (as I said) I could
in^^st: but I will proceed to other things following in this Prophecy.

And here first observe Hos. 3 chapter
the next chapter, and therein the very next pro^hecie of Hoseah, following
after the other aforesaid. Where the Lord ^ovv again giving another type, said
unto him, v. 1, etc.
Go yet, love a woman (be^^ved of her Or, husband, as it is translated Ier.
3, 20.
friend, yet an adulteress) according to the love of the Lord tovvard the
^^ildren of Israel, who look to other Gods, and love flagons of wine. etc.
Where eve^^ sentence of the prophecy is a convictio^ of their manifold errors.
The lord had before said to Hoseah, Hos. 1, 2, etc.
Go, take a wife of vvhoredomes, etc. chapter 1. (...) 2. Now after that whereof
he spoke both in the first and second chapter, he says unto him again, Go
yet, notvvithstanding that thou have done before, in taking a wife of
vvhoredomes etc. Go yet, I say, and love a vvo^^n beloved of her husband, yet
an adulteress. etc. And who now is typed out by this woman? The Lord
himself shows, it is the children of Israel. And who is this friend or
husband, that loves this woman. He says expressly ^^s the Lord that loves
the children of Israel? What also is this vvomans adultery? He, shows it
likewise as plainly to be Isreal's looking to other Gods, and loving flagons of
wine; that is, intentiuely worshipping idols, and delightfully frequenting
Exo. 32, 5, 6. with 1 Cor. 10, 7. Number. 25 2. with Psalm. 106, 28.
the banketting feasts, that were kept in honor of those their Idols. And
how very evident now are all these particulars?

If then the Prophet did in deed mean before, that Israel (being yet (...)
the land of Canaan) was not any way to be esteemed the Lords wife, ^^r he her
husband: how then says he here, that she is yet beloved of ^^e Lord, being an
idolatresse, as the woman that is loved of her husband ^^^ing an adulteress?
May we think that the Prophet contradicts him^^^f, as these men usually do
themselves? God forbid. Or does this type ^^ntradict the former, where she is
called Hos. 1, 2.
a wife of whoredoms? Or does (...) contradict the Prophet Jeremy, who also
speaking of Isreal's idola^^us defection from the Lord, says thus, Jer. 3, 20
Surely as a wife tretcherously de^^^teth from her Hebr. friend.
husband: so have you dealt tretcherously with me, O house of Israel, (...) the
Lord. Jer. 3, 20.

Why also does the Prophet in this same chapter (when again he threat^th their
exile) speak of it in the time to come, saying, Hos. 3, 4.
The children of Is^^^ shall abide many days without a King, and without a
prince, and without a sacri^^^^ and without an image, and without an Ephod,
and without Teraphim. etc. Why ^^th he not in the present time, The children
of Israel do now sit without a (...), and without a sacrifice, etc. but that
now he denounced what was yet ^^come, and did not declare what was upon them
already in this behalf? (...) as yet they had their king, and their sacrifices,
statutes, and Tera^^m, etc. and so had yet in their own land, among
themselves, the face of a church and common wealth: though adulterate and
corrupt. Hos. 3, 4. with 1, 1. and 9, 3. and 2 King. 14, 23.24. and 15, 8, 9,
17, 18, 24, 27, 28. and 17.1, 2. Yea, Zachariah, Shallum, Menahem, Pekachiah,
Pekah, Hoshea.
six kings reigned in Israel, after Jeroboam the son of Ioash in whose days
Hoseah prophesied. Hos. 1, 1. with 2 King. 14, 29. and 15, 8. 13, 16, 23, 27,
30. But the time was now a coming (as here he threatens) when they should
be Hos. 9, 3.12, 15, 17.
driven out of the Lords land, house, and presence, and be Esa. 7, 8.
so broken, as they should not now be a people; but Hos. 3, 4.
cease to have their own polity and kingdom, as hitherto they had enjoyed it
in their own land. Which accordingly came to pass afterward. 2 King. 17 chapter
Finally note here (by this occasion) whether the latter part of the third verse
of this chapter, may not be translated thus, Thou shall not be for an other
man, neither also will I be for thee (or, with thee:) ^^dler. (...)
repeating the negative particle in the latter clause: as al interpreters
usually do, in Psa. 9, 18. or (as some translations have it) ver. 19. Which
then also will have his weight for the matter in hand. And the more,
considering that the Lord othervvhere in this prophecy denounces this Woe
against them, saying Woe unto them, when I depart from them, Hos. 9, 12. And
hitherto of this Chapter, and the type contained therein: which about this
question is much to be observed.

Leave we now this chapter, and come to the other following, we find therein
that this Prophet himself does still afterward throughout his prophecy style
them My people. which shows that the other (of Loammi Hos 1, 9.) was a
prophecy, and not yet performd.
Ammi, and acknowledge them yet still to be the people of the Lord, and the Lord
to be their God, applying unto them the term of the covenant, and from thence
deducing sundry arguments of reproof and exhortation: according as his calling
and their estate required: A namely about their idolatrous worship; marying
with strangers; seeking unto the Assyrians and Egyptians, etc. Of which
(because I have spoken here before and shall have occasion hereafter to note
some things again out of thi^ Prophet) I will not now therefore insist upon
the particulars: but onel^ refer the reader to these and the like places in
this prophecy: to be compared also with the like in other of the Prophets:
Page 61, 62, 63.
viz. Hos. 4, 6, 8, 12. and ^ 4, 6, 7, 13. and 6, 4, 5, 6, 7. and 7, 8, 10, 11.
and 8, 1, 8, 9, 11, 12. and 9, 3, 15. and 11^ 7. and 12, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 14.
and 13, 4, 5, 11, 13, 16. and 14, 1. And thus much her of things to be observed
out of this prophecy it self.

Now if we compare herewith, the history and other Prophets, much more light
will yet appear hereabout. The history speaking of B^sha (the third king
from Jeroboam the son of Nehat) notes how the wo^ of the Lord came to Iehu
the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying 1 King. 16, 1, 2.
Forasmuch as I have exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my
peop^^ Israel, and thou have vvalked in the way of Jeroboam, and have made my
people Israel sin, etc. 1 Kin. 16, 1, 2. Which shows that the Lord now
accounted I^raell to be his people. As we have the like, 2 King. 9.6.
in the Lords speech to Ie^^^ (the tenth king of Israel after Jeroboam:) to
whom the Prophet annoi^ting him said, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, I
have anointed thee king or the people of the Lord, even over Israel. 2 King.
9, 6. Of which I have spoke here P. 58. etc
before more particularly. And most of all in the history of Johoa^^z and
Joash (the eleventh and twelfth kings after Jeroboam) where it (...) recorded,
that when Hazael king of Syria had oppressed Israel all the ^ayes of
Iehoahaz, 2 Kin. 13 23.
the Lord was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect
unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and ^ould
not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet. 2 Kin. 13, 23.
By which again it appears that yet they were still accounted the Lords
people and he their God; who (notwithstanding their sins deserved otherwise,
yet) was gracious unto them because of his covenant, and had not ^^ast them
from his presence as yet. Of which also I have spoken before. But ^hese things
are of such weight and use about the questions in controver^^e, as we cannot
enough observe and regard them, as we should: and in respect whereof I may well
omit other things that might be observed ^ut of the history hereabout.

For the Prophets; Amos, who prophesied as Hoseah did, in the ^ayes of Jeroboam
the son of Ioash (the thirteenth king from the other Ioroboam aforesaid)
shows the same things both for mercy and ^udgment to Israel throughout his
prophecy: and in the seventh and eight chapters, under types and similitudes;
other then those which Hoseah had, Amo. 7 chapter
^ut tending to one and the same end. As when, ver. 1, and 2.
by grassehoppers formed by the Lord, he notes out famine, or more easy
incursions of enemies, to ^ome upon them. Amos 7, 1, 2. And vst. 4.
by the Lords calling to contend by fire, figureth out greater and heavier
punishments; as the great troubles and ^aughters among themselves; and the sore
vvarres and calamities that should come upon them by foreign enemies, as by
Tiglath-pileser, etc. Amo. 7.4, 5, 6. The Amos 7, 2 -- 6.
mitigation of both which judgments (that they were ^ot wasted up by them)
Amos obteyneth of the Lord by prayer: where^n he uses reasons respecting the
covenant and mercy of the Lord: Of which see before, page 63. And lastly, Amo.
7, 7, 8.
by the Lords standing upon a wall try^^ by a plumbline, with a plumbline in
his hand, and Chap. 8, 1, 2.
by a basket of Summer fruit, etc. ^^oresheweth the destruction of the kingdom
of Israel, the end and over^hrovv of their estate both ecclesiastical and
civil: when the Lord would ^^are them no longer, nor pass them over any
more, but deliver them in^o the hands of the Salmanassar, and Esar-Haddon. 2
Kin. 17. Ezr. 4, 2.
kings of Assyria, to be ruinated, wasted, and carried ^way out of their own
land, etc. Amo. 7, 7, 8, 9, 11, 17. Which how fitly and ^irectly it agrees
with the prophecy and types of Hoseah, mentioned before, and with the history
it self, I need not stand here to declare, having (...) lately spoken thereof.

Only by the way let me vvish the Reader here to observe, how the lord has a
plumbline in his hand, which when he set in the midst of his people Israel,
trying out theit uneuenes and incorrigible iniquity, he ^ould not then pass
by them any more, but overthrew their estate, and ^rought upon them their
deserved punishment: like as a Amo. 7, 7, 8. with Psalm. 62, 3. Esa. 30, 13.
wall that be^^g tried by a plumbline, and found to be uneuen, bovved, and
swollen with ^reaches that cannot be amended, is therefore overturned and
thrown down. Thus teaching all Churches and people, to be careful in time
to redress their erroneous and sinful vvayes and courses, and in all things
to conform themselves and their estate according to the word of God, least
otherwise the Lord coming to take the plumbline in his hand, and finding their
estate to be uneuen and incorrigible, he then spare them no longer, but bring
upon them condign punishment: as he dealt of old with his people Israel, and
since has done the like with diverse christian Churches from time to time.

But to return to the point in hand, the Prophet Esaias makes the matter yet
more plain, when (prophesying in the days of Ahaz, as Hoseah also did) he
limiteth the time expressly from that day forward, saying: Within threescore
and five years, shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people. Esa. 7, 1, 8.
with Hos. 1, 1, 9. and 3, 4. and with Deuteronomy. 32, 21. So yet then it was not
done. Which Hoseah also often showed, both by the types before spoken off; and
more expressly, when speaking of Israel, he says in plain terms, speaking of
the time yet to come, Hos. 9, 17.
My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him; and they
shall be wanderers among the nations. Where, there is a denunciation of exile
and rejecting of them by the Lord; as had been before in the first, second, and
third chapters of this Prophecy: So plainly signifying, that as yet it was not
done: seeing that yet they were not cast away by the Lord, nor made wanderers
among the nations: but were yet still dwelling in the Lords land, where and
when Hoseah thus prophesied unto them.

Which is made evident yet further, when the Prophet in the same chapter
threatens also for time to come, saying, Hos. 9, 3.
They shall not dwell in the Lords land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt,
and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria, etc. And, ver. 12.
Woe unto them, when I depart from them. And moreover again, ver. 15.
For the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house; I will
love them no more. So then hitherto the Lord had loved them, and was not
departed from them, but showed compassion upon them, and kept them in his own
land, as in his house and presence, and had not yet driven them from thence to
be vvanderers in other lands: etc. Which when the Lord afterward brought upon
them, then was the bill of divorce given, whereof Ier. 3, 8.
Jeremy speaks: which was also thus foretold by Hoseah and the other
Prophets, as is aforesaid.

But what is this to the point of the question in hand, which is not touching
the condition afterward; but concerning their circumcision and estate, from
the time af Ieroboams apostasy, whiles they were yet in the kind, as in the
Lords house and presence: and so in deed, before the bill of divorce was given
them, and they cast out of the Lords house and presence? In which time, how
graciously the Lord dealt with them, and respected his covenant toward the^;
and how the Prophets esteemed them, and dealt with them, as with the people
of God, the Scripture every where shows, as we have here before specified.
Which how these men will ever make to accord with their assertions, let the
time manifest, and such as are judicious observe.

And now that I am here speaking of the Prophets, I could also note out of
Ezekiel, how the Lord bade him lie on his side, Ezec. 4, 4, 5, 6..
and bear the iniquity of Israel three hundred and ninety days: that is
(reckning a day for a year) 390 years: the Lord so noting out his long
sufferance and bearing with his people, notwithstanding their idolatry, before
he cast them off. Ezec. 4, 4, 5, 6. But how should this be verifyed, if the
Lord himself brake covenant with them and cast them off, when they fell into
Idolatry, with Jeroboam the son of Nebat? Nay, seeing these years of Gods
long sufferance began with Ieroboams reign and falling into apostasy, (as Mr.
Brought. Consent of Scripture.
some reckon them) or about the seven and twentieth year of Salomons reign,
when he declined to idolatry, 1 Kin. 11.4 (as M. Junius annot. Ezec. 4, 4, 5.
others think) and ended with the last captivity and carrying away of the
Jews by Nebuchadnezer: this does directly confirm the particulars, which I
have here before alleged against the objections aforesaid. Besides that this
same Prophet, Ezec. 16, and 23 chapter
othervvhere shows (as I have noted Page 74, etc.
here before) that Judah by her idolatry and iniquity, justified her sister
Israel. So as if by their idolatry, the covenant was also broken on Gods
part, and circumcision among them become a lying sign and detestable
sacrament: then must it likewise be in Judah: And where then was the Church of
God, and his ordinance of circumcision, if it was neither with Israel nor
Judah? But Jeremy says, that Israel was not forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of
the Lord of hosts, though their land was filled with sin against the holy one
of Israel. And Hoseah (no doubt) contradicts not the other Prophets. So as
then we must still remember, to distinguish betvveene the breach of the
covenant on the peoples part, together with the speeches of the Prophets that
are spoken in that respect: and between the breaking and regarding of the
covenant on the Lords part, and the things spoken by the Prophets in that
behalf. When Israel played the harlot, and brake the covenant on their part,
yet the Lord bare with them a long time, and showed compassion upon them,
respecting the covenant on his own part, which he in mercy had made with the^:
as now we have seen out of the history and Prophets aforesaid.

It is also a common thing with the Prophets to speak of things to come as if
they were already done, because of the certainty of the fulfilling of them
accordingly. As when Hoseah says, Hos. 8, 8.
Israel is swallowed up, now Meaning they shall be. As the Translations have
it usually.
they have been (or are) among the Gentiles, as a vessel wherein is no
pleasure: when as yet they dwelt in the Lords land, uncast out from thence: as
he shows in the next chapter, and throughout his prophecy. Hos. 9, 3, 11,
12, 13, etc.

Hoseah moreover was one of the last Prophets, that prophesied to Israel
before their final captivity: and continued prophesying from the days of
Vzziah, unto the reign of Hezekiah; in the sixth year of whose reign, Israel
was captived by Salmanassar king of Assyria: So he might now well speak of
things as already done, which were so shortly and certainly to be fulfilled.
And namely, of the things signified by the children aforesaid, succeding one
after another, Jezreel, Lo-ruchamah, Lo-ammi. With the last whereof (Lo-ammi,
not my people) may that also agree, that she is not my wife, nor I her husband.
Hos. 2, 2. with 1, 9. Yet himself that in the first chapter thus foresheweth
their estate, by the child named Lo-ammi, not my people: does notvvithstanding
afterward still call the^ Ammi, my people, throughout his Prophecy; so teaching
us how to esteem to them, until that was performed in deed, which was thus
foreshevved in figure. And again the Lord that by the Prophet says in the
second Chapter, Plead with your mother, that she is not my wife, nor I her
husband; does afterward in the third chapter say to the same Prophet, Go yet,
love a woman (beloved of her Or, husband.
friend, yet an adulteress) according to the love of the Lord toward the
children of Israel, who look to other Gods, and love flagons of wine. etc. And
many the like might be shevved out of this and the other Prophets. In all
which we must always be careful so to understand the Prophets (if we will
understand them aright) as one place may agree with another, and not imply
contradictions. For they neither contradict themselves, nor one another. And it
has always ben a special fountain of error and heresy, to take hold of the
sound or letter of some words in some places, without conferring them with
other Scriptures, or having regard to the circumstances of the place it self,
not so much as respecting what goes before, or follows after, or the like.

Finally, the Chaldee Paraphrase thus expounds that which is written in Hos.
2, 2. Ionathae Chald. paraphr. in Hos. 2, 1.
Rebuke the congregation of Israel, and say unto her, that she submits not
her self to my worship, therefore neither does Christ. So this Paraphrast
often speaks.
my word accept of her prayers: until she shall remove her evil works out of
her sight, and the worship which she yields to idols out of the mids of her
cities. Thus has the Chaldee Paraphrase. Where mark if their exposition do
not agree with the things aforesaid, and lead us so to understand this
Scripture, as if it were said, Plead with your mother, that she is not my wife,
nor I her husband: that is, that she does not demean and carry her self as
becomes my wife, in that she submits not unto my worship, which I have
appointed her: therefore neither do I show my self toward her as her
husband, to receive her requests in the time of her need, and accordingly to
succor and protect her, etc. And it is not unknovvne among men, that sometimes
such things and speeches fall out between married persons, when yet
notvvithstanding they remain still man and wife together, until there be a
divorce and forsaking one of another. Neither are such manner of phrases (in
other cases) unusual in the Scriptures, and common speeches of men. Ioh. 8,
39. Job 17, 14. Pro. 7, 4. and 12, 4. Ier. 2, 27. Esa. 1, 10, 21. and 57, 3, 4.
Ezech. 16, 3, 35, 44. etc. And note withal that the case both of all the
tribes (when they were together) and afterward of Judah also was often such
(as the Chaldee paraphrase here speaks) that they submitted not to the
worship of God, but followed idols and other Gods: vvhereupon the Lord many
times refused to hear their prayers, and to protect them, as formerly he had
done: and gave them up into their enemies hand, time after time. Iud. 2, 12.
etc. 2 Chro. 28, and 33 chapter Jer. 2, 13. and 7, 15, 16. and 11, 13, 14. and 14,
10, 11, 12. Esa. 57, 3 -- 8. and ^5, 2 -- 7. Zach. 7, 12, 13, 14. Yet were
they still the Lords wife and people, and he their God and husband: as I think
these men themselves will not deny. And diverse Calvin, Danaeus, etc. in Hos. 2,
2.
good interpreters expounding this Scripture, do so understand it, as thinking
it agrees with that which is written in Esa. 50, 1. (where the Prophet
speaks of Judah, to whom the Lord had not given a bill of divorce) And with
Ezec. 16 chapter spoken of before. And Danaeus, ibid.
some of them also compare it with Ier. 3, 8. which speaks of Israel, when
they were out of the land of Canaan, and given into the hands of the
Assyrians, etc. Whereof I have treated here before more particularly.

To conclude then, by that which has been said may appear, how in this Hos. 2
chapter
chapter there is a further explication and application of Both for the
judgeme^ts threatened and mercies promised.
things spoken of in the former chapter; and that the several names, and times
of the birth of the children ( Hos. 1, 4.6, 9.
there spoken of) follovving one after another by degrees, and being given as
types unto Israel, do necessarily show, that this people came not to be Not
the Lords people.
Lo-ammi, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat set up the calves, and Israel fell
into idolatry with him, but a long time afterward, as has been shevved
before: Moreover, that when Hos. 1, 4. with v. 6, and 9.
Jezreel was borne of Gomer the harlot (noting the avenging of the blood of
Iezreel upon the house of Iehu, which was about two hundred years after
Ieroboams apostasy) then Israel yet was Ruchamah, and Ammi still: And
finally, that when Israel, for their continuance in sin, came to be Hos. 1,
6 with ver. 8 and 9.
Lo-ruchamah, unpittied, or not obteyning mercy (some of the tribes and cities
being delivered up into the hands of Tiglath Pileser, etc.) yet were they Ammi
still: and so continued until the birth of the next child, when Gomer brought
out Hos. 1, 8.9.
Loammi, not my people: whenas Israel was carried away by Salmanasser out of
the Lords land, driven out of the Lords house, cast away by the Lord out of
his presence, and made vvanderers among the heathen nations. As has been
shevved heretofore out of the Prophets and history, compared together.

And hitherto of this Scripture, in Hos. 2, 2. and of the things that go
before and follovv after in the same Prophecy, 2 King, 17. etc.
and the like in other Scriptures, concerning the question in hand. Of which I
have spoken the more largely: desiring that the right and true meaning of this
and the other Prophets in these things may be found out, and rightly observed.
Which now (both for my self and others) I leave to further consideration:
hoping that the right discerning and distinguishing of the things aforesaid,
will give us great light, both to direct us how to esteem of churches in
apostasy, and to keep us from the aberrations that are now so common, both on
the right hand and on the left: whiles some regard not the defection or
corruptions of Churches, as they should, and others by reason thereof would
presently and utterly make a nullitie of such Churches, or of the ordinances of
God, yet remaining (though corrupted) therein.

Touching Hos. 13.1.
The next Scripture here alleged, is out of the same Prophet, Hos. 13, 1.
where the words are these, Hos. 13, 1.
When Ephraim spoke, trembling, he exalted himself (or, stirred it up) in
Israel, but when he offended in Baal, he dyed. Of the diversity of the
translation, and application of these words, I vvil not insist. Only for the
point in hand, observe these things.

First, that the same term and phrase is used by Christ, speaking of the
church of Sardis: when he says to John, Unto the Angel of the church in
Sardis write, These things says he that has the seven spirits of God, and the
seven stars: I know thy works, that thou have a name that thou live, and
art dead. Rev. 3, 1. Should we now infer hereupon (as this man here does upon
the like phrase in the Prophets touching Israel) that therefore baptism, and
the other ordinances of God had in the church of Sardis, were but in show
retained therein, and could not be unto them the signs and seals of
forgiveness of sins, and of life eternal: and therefore were in their use of
them, false and deceitful: as were the ordinances (as he says) of God,
retained among the Gentiles? Would any man of heart and understanding, endure
such blasphemy? Says not the Scripture, that the church of Sardis, was one
of the seven golden candlesticks showed unto John? And does not Christ our Lord
(who has the seven spirits of God, and whose eyes are as a flame of fire)
accordingly approve it so to be? Rev. 1, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20. with 3, 1, etc.
Far rather will I, with Christ and his Apostle, esteem it to be dead in some
respect, and yet acknowledge it a golden Candlestick, and true Church of God in
other respect: then gather such manner of consequences, as this man usually does
upon any such phrases, that he meteth vvithall. And this is the more to be
minded touching this doctrine of his, because himself in the same treatise
affirms, that Animad. page 103.
our reasons from Israel are impertinent to the estate of Rome (there spoken
off) but might well serve for the times wherein John lived, when the true
Rev. 2, and 3 cha.
Churches were many of them apostate. Where also he cites in the margent,
Rev. 2 and 3 chapters: and so this Church of Sardis for one. Where I might note
again his contradicting of himself, and his manifold errors in diverse
respects, if I would here stand thereupon. For if the estate of apostate
Israel, may well serve the times of John, when the true churches (spoken off
in the Revelation, chapter 2, and 3.) were many of them apostate: then it cannot
be that the estate and ordinances of God had in Israel should be such, as
Animad. p. 70 etc.
in this other place, and throughout his treatise he would bear us in hand:
The^ also should Israel be a true church, though in apostasy: as here himself
calls those churches in the Revelation, apostate, and yet true churches:
Which by word and vvriting othervvhere he still oppugneth. That which
concerns the church of Rome, may be touched othervvhere. In the mean time,
we have now enough from these men themselves, seeing the church of Sardis,
which they say was apostate, and Christ says was dead, is by themselves
acknowledged to be a true church, and by the Scriptures approved for a golden
candlestick. So al their pretenses and oppositions vanish into smoke.

Secondly, for the place of Hoseah it self, if it be understood, as (by putting
a word to the text) here they expound it, of death in sin: yet let it be
well considered, whether it will therefore follow, that circumcision now in
Israel was not the Lords sign, and his seal of forgiveness of sin, but a
false and deceitful sign in their use thereof, and no better then the
ordinances of the heathen. The Scripture shows, how when one being called of
Christ to follow him, requested, saying, Luke. 9, 59, 60.
Lord suffer me first to go and bury my father: Christ said unto him again,
Let the dead bury the dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God:
meaning, Let the dead spiritually bury those that are dead bodily. Shall we
now therefore hereupon gather, that the circumcision then had among the Jews,
was a false and deceitful sign in their use thereof, and not the Lords seal
of forgiveness of sin, and eternal life? Also when Paul, speaking of
widovves in the Church, says, 1 Timothy 1 3, 5, 6.
Honor widows that are widows in deed, etc. Now she that is a widow in
deed, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and
prayers night and day: But she that lives in pleasure, is dead while she
lives. Meaning, she that lives the natural life, but is dead with spiritual
death. May we now infer hereupon, that the baptism had in the church of
Ephesus (where Timothee thus written unto, 1 Timothy 1, 3.
now was) or in any other of the Primitive churches, wherein such widows were,
was not the Lords sign of the remission of sins and eternal life, but a
lying and execrable sign in their use thereof, and no better then the heathens
baptism, or other observations of theirs? Shall the infidelity of man make
Gods truth of none effect? Shall not God be true, though men be liars? Shall
not his signs and seals still be his true and holy ordinances, though either
Churches generally, or some particular persons that enjoy them, walk unworthy
of them, abuse and corrupt both them and themselves? If some among this people
that write shus, yea if the Congregation it self, vvherof these men themselves
are, should be dead in sin (having Romans 16.17. Gal. 5, 19, 20. Heb. 10, 25
Jude v. 19.
offended and scandalously divided themselves from the church whereof they
were, as Arrow against idolatry. p. 4, 71. etc.
they acknovvledge that Israel did from Judah, notwithstanding all their
pretenses to the contrary:) will they therefore yield, that the baptism had
among them, is not the Lords ordinance, nor his sign and seal of forgiveness
of sin, and of eternal life, but a lying and deceitful sign in their use
thereof, and no better then the heathens ordinances? Or if some in any
Churches, even in the best at this day, be found dead in their sins, will
they therefore infer such consequences about the baptism and other ordinances
of God, had among them, that they are not the Lords signs and seals, but
lying and deceitful in their use thereof? The word of God it self, is by some
made unto themselves the savor of death unto death: Is it not therefore in the
Lords ordinance, the savor of life unto life? 2 Cor. 2, 14, 15, 16. So
likewise is it with the Lords supper, as the Apostle shows, 1 Cor. 11, 18
-- 34. Yet may we not therefore gather such consequences thereupon, as these
men do about the question in hand.

Thirdly, their exposition of the place aforesaid being admitted, it was then
that Israel became dead in sin, when they offended in Baal. But the worship
of Baal in the ten tribes, was first instituted by Achab. 1 Kin. 16. 31, 32,
33. And Ahab was the seventh king of Israel, and reigned, about threescore
years, after Jeroboam the son of Nebat that set up the Calves and caused
Israel to sin, 1 King. 12 -- 16 chap. And there was great difference
between Ieroboams calves, and Baals idolatry: as appears both by Eliahs
history, who 1 Kin. 18, 18. etc.
directly and earnestly set himself against the Prophets of Baal, in Ahabs
time, that first brought them into Israel and by Iehues history, who 2 King.
10, 28, 29.
destroyed Baal out of Israel, and yet, from the sins of Jeroboam the son
of Nebat that caused Israel to sin, he departed not from after the^, to wit,
the golden calves, that were in Dan and Bethel. Will they now therefore grant
that Israel was alive, and not dead in sin, till Achabs time that they
offended in Baal: and that the circumcision in Israel, was Gods seal, and no
deceitful sign, all the time betvveen Ieroboams reign and Achabs,
notwithstanding Ieroboams apostasy and setting up of the calves at Dan and
Bethell? If they grant this, then their assertion is overthrown; If they deny
it, what then will they say to their own allegation and exposition of this
Scripture, that when Israel offended in Baal, they became dead in sin: seeing
Baals idolatry was brought into Israel by Ahab, a good many years after
Ieroboams setting up of the calves: as I shevved here before.

Fourthly, the Scripture shows, that in Eliahs time, there were ^ King. 19,
18.
seven thousand in Israel, who bowed not the knee unto Baal. What now shall we
say to these? Were they not circumcised? Or had they not the circumcision that
was then in Israel? Or was it not unto them the Lords seal of forgiveness of
sin, and eternal life: but a false and deceitful sign in their use, and no
better then the ordinances retained among the Heathen: as here they speak of
the circumcision then had in Israel? Or was this Sacrament of the Lord, being
one and the same in it self, a true sign and seal unto these: but a lying
sign and deceitful seal unto others? Or does the truth of Gods Sacraments
depend on man, and not on the Lord himself? Or shall the sin of man make the
truth of God to be a lie?

Fifthly, the Scripture also shows, that Ier. 7, 2, 9.
Judah burnt incense unto Baal, and walked after other Gods whom they knevv
not. and again, that they Ire. 19, 3, 4, 5.
forsook the Lord, and built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons
with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, etc. And moreover, that when all the
tribes were together, in the time of the judges, then also Judge. 2, 11, 12,
13. and 8, 33.
the children of Israel forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtaroth. Will
they now here again infer, as they do touching the ten tribes, that then
circumcision and other ordinances of God now had in Judah, and beforetime in
the days of the Judges could not be unto them the Lords sign and seal of
forgiveness of sins, and of life eternal, and therefore were in their use of
them false and deceitful, as were also the ordinances retained among the
Gentiles? What shall we say to these things? Where then was circumcision had,
that was the Lords sign and seal of forgiveness of sin, unto his people, if
it was neither in Israel nor in Judah, if it was a false and deceitful sign
in their use, if the ordinances of God retained in Judah and Israel, were no
better then the ordinances retained among the Heathen? Who is there fearing
God, that could endure such false and deceitful consequences: which do but
strengthen the Anabaptists in their errors, and seduce others to like impiety.

If they would succor themselves by means of these clauses inserted, (unto
them, in their use of them, etc.) I have Page 37, 38. etc.
heretofore shevved how these will not help the matter, being duly and rightly
considered: which I shall not need here to repeat. Only remember still, that
though man's idolatry or other sins may make Gods sacraments or other
constitutions unprofitable unto himself: yet they cannot make them to be lying
and deceitful signs; yea they cannot hinder but that in the Lords ordinance,
they are unto al, and therefore also unto them, the Lords true signs and
faithful seals (on his part) of the forgiveness of sins and of eternal
life. If men by their own unbelief and impiety make them unprofitable unto
themselves: shall therefore the infidelity of man turn the truth of God into
a lie? God forbid.

And observe moreover, that if the Sacraments were not still the Lords signs
and seals of remission of sins and life eternal: woeful would be the case
of the most godly on the earth, who sin and transgress daily: and vvo would
it (be in particular) with such as are borne or live in an idolatrous estate,
when they repent and turn again unto the Lord. For what should they now do,
to have assurance by the Lords seal of the forgiveness of their sins? Should
they be circumcised or baptized a new? So in deed would the Anabaptists, whom
we have confuted before. Or can a false and deceitful sign, be the Lords
true seal of mercy unto them? Or shall the same circumcision and baptism,
which is to day a lying sign and a deceitful seal unto men (when they are in
Idolatry or other iniquity) become unto them to morrow the Lords true sign
and seal of grace and eternal life? And if the same men sin likewise
again, then it again become false and execrable? And if they repent again,
then the same again be the true and holy sign and seal of forgiveness of
sins and life eternal unto them? And so change and alter from time to time,
to be the Lords sign to day, and a lie to morrow, to be the Lords seal the
next day, and execrable again the day following; and thus daily to be turned
from a lie to a truth, and from a truth to a lie again, as frail and
sinful man shall demean and carry himself? Which what is it else, but also to
make man's repentance, faith, and obedience, and not the Lords free grace,
promise, and fidelity, to be grounds and foundation of the Sacraments, etc.
And so to bring people to Anabaptistry and Arminianisme in the end?

Sixthly, it is not unknown that the term (dying) is diversely used in the
Scriptures: And many both Jews and Christian writers do otherwise understand
it here, then of being dead in sin, as by their writings upon this place may
appear. Some whereof it will not be amiss to mention, considering what
manner of conclusions are builded upon this Scripture as on the other
aforesaid. Jonathae f. Vzz. Chal. paraphr. in Hos. 13, 1. David Kimhi. Aben
Ezra. Sal. Jarchi.
And first of the Jew Writers:

The Chaldee Paraphrase expounds it thus, When heretofore some of Ephraim
spoke, fear took hold on the people: they had the dominion in Israel: but
after they turned to the worship of idols, they are slain. Rabbi David Kimhi
thus, Ephraim lift up his head in Israel: but after he sinned in Baal, he
dyed. As if he should say, He was wounded before his enemies, as if he were
dead, because his hand [his strength] went away.

Aben Ezra thus, He was accounted as dead: and moreover, because Abiah slew all
his ormy: Referring it to Jeroboam, who was of Ephraim, as others also do.
Solomon Iarchi thus, After he came up unto greatness, he sinned in idolatry:
and he dyed: the house of Jeroboam was cut off, and likewise the house of Ahab.

As touching the Christian writers, Mercerus expounds it thus, The beginning of
idolatry [in Israell] was the worship of the Calves, Mercerus.
brought into Israel out of Egypt, where Jeroboam had lived an exile. Hereupon
there followed an other evil, the worship of Baal the Sidonian idol, brought
in by Iezabel (Ahabs wife) 1 King. 16. What calamity followed hereupon, he
shows He dyed.
in one word: See more in the history. The family of Ahab was cut off, the
land was afflicted with famine, which was accompanied with the plague and
foreign enemies, etc. And then again (applying it to Jeroboam:) After that
he sinned by idolatry (for Baal is often the general name of an idol) he
dyed, all his dignity and beauty being lost. The house of Jeroboam, for the
calves that he set up, was destroyed, according to the word of the Lord by the
Prophet.

Zanchius thus, As there is a threefold generation: a Bodily, when one is borne
being conceived by the seed of man: Zanchius.
a Spiritual, when one of being the son of Adam is born anew by the boly
Ghost, to be the son of God: and a Civil, when one from low degree is
advanced to some dignity, or is freed from hard servitude to happy liberty:
So there is a threefold death. A Bodily, when the soul is severed from the
body: a Spiritual, when a man through sin is bereft of the grace of God,
which is the life of the soul: and a Civil, when a man is deprived of his
dignity and power or kingdom or his happy estate. Now by the name of [death]
in this place comes properly to be understood the Civil death. And that word
[He dyed,] respects two things, both the present estate, wherein Israel then
was, and their future estate now shortly to come. When therefore he says, [And
he dyed,] showing the other estate of Israel, such as was at that present, and
such as should shortly follow after, he teaches, that the kingdom of Israel
for their idolatry, both was so far weakened, as it wanted little of utter
ruin, and that shortly and certainly it should utterly be destroyed.

Calvin thus, After that they sinned in Baal, they dyed, to wit, because God
deprived the tribe of Ephraim of that power, Calvin.
wherewith before he had adorned it, so as they wanted little of utter decay.
For although their kingdom was not yet fallen, yet was it come even to the
utmost, so as the Prophet might well say they were dead, that did now so far
differ from their former estate. But where he says, [They sinned in Baal,] it
is certain that this was not the beginning of their idolatry. Jeroboam first
made the calves: afterward his successor set up Baal, and borrowed that
superstition from their neighbors the Sidonians, as is thought.

English notes.
And accordingly the notes of our English Bibles have it thus, The Ephraimites
are not far from destruction, and have lost their authority.

Drusius thus, That people is said to dye which is utterly wasted and
destroyed. Amos 2, 2. [And Moab shall dye with tumult.] So in another Prophet,
Haba. 1, 12.
[Thou art God from everlasting, Drusius.
we shall not dye.] Others expound it, he is dead in sins: Which I do less
approve. I had rather thus take it, [He is dead,] he has received diverse
overthrowes and slaughters, he is fallen into grievous calamities, which
afterward perpetual exile followed. And although corrections be instructions:
yet when he suffered those so many evils, they did not profit him at all. So
thus I say, They could not bring him to life again.

Tremellius and Iunius thus, [He dyed,] That is, he was accounted as dead,
being of no account, Tremel. and Junius. Piscator.
and of no power or might.

And Piscator thus, [He Dyed,] that is, he lost his authority, so as he did no
more make the subjects to tremble, as before. It is a metaphorical speech. For
as the Greek proverb says, The dead bites not.

Thus have I set down particularly the exposition of diverse vvriters upon this
place: that so it might the better appear, not only how these men do ground
their assertions, in so weight matters as these are, upon such understanding
of the Scripture, as both Jew vvriters and Christians (of the best) are
otherwise minded therein: but also, that this Scripture being so understood, as
both Jews and Christians expound it, there can no such opinion or conclusions
be gathered from it, as these men would hereby mainteyne: as any may perceive.
And that from their own exposition, such consequences will not follovv, I
have shevved before. And if neither from their own nor others exposition
hereof, what a manner of proof then is this? Which if they will not yet observe
in the case of Israel, let them but consider it in their own, thus as
follows.

If one applying this Scripture unto them, should say: N.N. was a teaching
Elder, and ruled also in the church, but when he offended by schism and false
doctrine, he dyed: that is, he lost his dignity and authority, being by the
Church put from the ministration of the Teachers office, which before he
executed with good regard in the Church: And that the rest of them, are dead
with him in like sort, according to the place and estate which they had in
the church formerly: etc. Or, If some should so apply this Scripture unto them
(as they do to Israel) thus: when they offended by despising and opposing the
governors and government of the church, by contention, confusion, and breaking
away from the church offensiuely, they dyed; and so remain unto this day,
dead in their sins: If then another (keeping their own words) should infer
hereupon, that therefore the baptism and other ordinances of God which they in
show reteyn, cannot be unto them the signs and seals of forgiveness of
sins, and of life eternal: and therefore are in their use of them, false and
deceitful; as be also the ordinances of God (as they call them, that are)
retained among the beathens: Would they now themselves yield, either that the
baptism, and other ordinances of God had among them, are but retained in show;
or that they cannot be unto them the signs and seals of forgiveness of sins
and of life eternal; or that they are in their use of them false and
deceitful; or that they be but as the ordinances retained among the heathens?
etc. Or if they or their children should repent, and return to the Lord and
his Church again, would they reject the baptism they have, as false and
deceitful; and get them another that might be unto them the sign and seal of
forgiveness of sins? Or would they still reteyne a false and deceitful
sign, and such as is no better then the baptismes and other ordinances of the
Pagans? Or think they that a lying and deceitful sign, which is no better
then the ordinances of the heathens, can be the Lords true sign and holy seal
of forgiveness of sins and of life eternal? Or that the Lords sign and seal
of forgiveness of sins can be false and decetfull, as be the ordinances of the
heathens? Let them consider these things in their heart, and take better heed
to their ways and assertions hereafter.

Lastly, to omit other things heretofore observed in this Prophet: if they had
but looked either to the things here going a little before, or to (...)
ordinances had among them, See also Jer. 50, 17, 18. etc.
was but as the Gentiles? Or do these men now judge righter of their estate,
then the Prophets did then? Or shall we believe them, rather then the Prophets
of the Lord? Far be it from us.

If any except, that these things here spoken by Micah, may be applied, and so
are by Piscator, etc.
some, to Jerusalem and Judah: I deny it not: though Danaeus, in ver. 16. etc.
some also think that they were then applied to Israel properly. But this
hinders not, but in some respect furthereth the matter against these men:
seeing that this Prophet, prophesying Micah. 1, 1.
both against Samaria (in Israel) and Jurusalem (in Judah:) joyneth them both
in like transgressions of idolatry, oppression, contempt of the word of God
taught by the Prophets, love of false Prophets and their dawbing, etc. Mica. 1,
5, 13. and 2, and 3 chap. and 5, 12, 13, 14. And in this same chapter (whereof
we speak) mentions in particular Mic. 6, 16
the keeping of the statutes of Omri, and all the works of the house of Ahab,
and walking in their counsels, etc. Now both Omri and Ahab were kings of
Israel, and of the worst of them: the one making statutes for maintenance of
the idolatry received, and the other bringing in moreover the worship of Baal,
(as was noted Mic. 1, 5, 13. and 5, 12, 13, 14. with 6, 16
here before.) So as whether the things aforesaid be applied to Israel, or to
Judah, P. 89, 90
in whom the transgressions of Israel were found: it will come much to a like
end, touching the point in controversy: for either or both of them, now still
to be the Lords people, to whom Mic. 6, 2 -- 5.
the things aforesaid were applied by the Prophet Micah: and many the like by
other of the Prophets also, as by diverse instances has been shevved before:
Page 58, etc And thus much touching this objection, and the Scriptures
aforesaid here alleged.

OBJECTION V.
But M. Aiu. Animadv. p. 81, 82, 91.
things are named in Scripture sometime as they have been before, though they be
not so still: as 1 Sa^. 30, 5.
Abigail is called the wife of Nabal, though he were then dead, and she married
to David; Mat. 1, 6
Solomon was begotten of Vriahs wife, whereas she was then David's: so Jesus was
Mat. 26, 6.
in the house of Simon the Leper, so named because he had been a Leper. Thus
Israel were called Gods people, for that he had been their Hos. 2, 7.
first husband, though in their apostasy they were Ho. 1, 9. and 2, 2.
not his people, nor his wife. Secondly, they were so called, in respect of
their profession, that they would be so esteemed and named, though in deed they
were 2 Chronicles. 25, 3.
without the true God. As, Mic. 2, 7, 8
O thou that art named the house of Jacob, etc. but he that was yesterday my
people, is risen up for an enemy. Thirdly, they were called Gods people, in
respect of their calling again unto him and his covenant afterward, though for
the present they were none of his: As Hos. 2, 18, 19,
In that day I will marry thee (Israel) unto me for ever, ver. 20.
I will even marry thee unto me in faith, and thou shall know the Lord: and
ver. 23.
I will have pity on her that was not pitied and will say to them which
were not my people, thou art my people, and they shall say, thou art my God.
And thus the Gentiles were called Christ's Sheep, because they should after be
brought into his fold, Ioh. 10, 16. and God had much people in Corinth a
heathenish city, Act. 18, 10. 1 Cor. 12, 2. and the Jews to this day are Gods
people and beloved, not for their present state which is cursed, but for the
promise that they shall hereafter be graffed again into Christ. Romans
11.11.20.23.25.26. and 9.4. with Esa. 59, 20.21. Ezech. 34, 23 -- 30. Hos. 3.5.

ANSWER
Will these men still darken counsel by words without knowledge? will they
never make an end of multiplying their shifts and evasions, errors and false
doctrines, abuse of the Word and Scriptures of God, etc.

SHIFTS AND EVASIONS.
For shifts (besides the other spoken off before) note these also here. 1. That
he says, things are named in Scripture sometime, Shift^.
as they have been before, etc. What then? Are they therefore always so named?
Or is it so therefore in the Scriptures, which we allege about the question in
hand? If I again should say, that things are named in Scripture sometime as
they are in deed and in truth, and not only as they have been or shall be: And,
that the Jews are in the Scripture sometime called the people of God, because
they were so in deed, being his Church, and under his covenant: vvil he now
therefore grant that so it is in the places alleged about the point in
question?

2. He passes by, Advertis. p. 59.
and answers not the Scriptures which I cited hereabout, namely, 2 King. 9,
6. and 13, 23. 2 Chronicles. 30, 6 -- 9. Hos. 4, 6, 12. and 5, 4. and 14, 2. Amos 7,
15. and 8, 2. etc. Which are so very evident against them (besides many other
Here before p. 59. etc.
now moreover alleged) as if they had but offered to handle them, all would
soon have perceived they could find no answer thereunto.

3. Also in the Scriptures which himself cites, he passes by the
consideration of that which went before, and which follows after, yea and
sometimes of that which is in the same verse, that he alleges: so making his
pretenses to have the more color: Hos. 1, 9. and 2, 2, 7. Mica. 2, 7, 8, etc.
though in the trial thereof they prove to have the less substance: as may
appear by that which has been, and yet is further to be spoken of his abuse of
the Scriptures. And note this the more in his dealing against us: because in
other matters and treatises (where he has a good cause in hand) he knows
and uses to deal better and otherwise.

4. He shuffles together the times and estates of Israel, spoken off by the
Prophets: some things being spoken of them, when they were yet in the land of
promise, some when they were cast out of the land, and made wanderers among the
nations; betvveen which, there is great difference; as I have shevved here
before. Neither does he only confound the times, but darken the true and
right meaning of the Scriptures, what he can: of which more hereafter,
although enough have been showed before hereabout, to such as are wise of heart.

ERROVRS.
For errors and false doctrines, note here again that still he says, and
would persuade it (if he could) that Israel in their apostasy was not the
Lords people. If so, what will he then say of Judah, in their apostasy? Were
not they Gods people neither? The Prophets often Mic. 1, 1, 5, 13. 2 Chr. 28, 2.
join them together, and show, that the transgressions of Israel were found in
Judah: yea that Ezec. 16, and 23.
Judah was worse then Israel in her abominations, and justified Samaria and
Sodom, in respect of her self. But of this sufficient has been spoken before.
And what vvil he say to the churches of Asia, which he also says were Animad.
p. 103.
apostate in John's time? were not they neither in their apostasy the people
of the Lord? And this is the more to be observed, because he himself would have
us to apply our reasons that are taken from Israel to those times and churches
in John's days: as I noted here before. His words are these, Ibid.
Thus their reasons from Israel are also impertinent to the (present) estate
of the church of Rome: they might Note this well.
well serve for the times wherein John lived Revel. 2, and 3 chap.
when the true churches were many of them apostate. So then he thinks that
apostate Israel, and these churches may be compared together. Now the
Scripture calls these churches Rev. 1^, 12. and 2, 1.
golden Candlesticks, in the midst vvherof Christ walks: and himself calls
these true Churches, which he says also were apostate: and would have us to
apply our Reasons from Israel, unto them. How is it then that when he
opposes us about Israel, he tells us, that Israel in their apostasy was not
the Church or people of God, nor under his covenant, but divorced from the
Lord; and that the circumcision had among them, was not the true sign and
seal of Gods covenant, but in their use a false and deceitful sign unto
them; as was also the ordinances (as he calls them) of God retained among the
Gentiles, etc. Will he also say thus of the churches of Asia, in John's time? Or
would he have us to apply these things which he speaks of Israel unto them?
Far be it from us. It is much better for us and all other to observe these
errors and contradictions of his, which are now so usual with him, in his
erroneous pleas and assertions into which he is fallen. Whereof I have spoken
also before. Moreover the Prophets teach us, that these Phrases, Zach. 2, 11.
to be joined to the Lord, and, to be the people of the Lord, are both alike,
and come to a like end. And the many reasons and Scriptures Page 58, and. etc.
before alleged, shevving that Israel in apostasy was yet by the Prophets
acknowledged to be the Lords people and under his covenant, are here still to
be remembered: though I do not again repeat them.

2. And so here is to be noted another notable error and false doctrine, viz.
that if the opinion which here (and throughout his treatise) he teaches, and
would father upon the Prophets, were true, then should the Prophets contradict
themselves and the other Scriptures: inasmuch as by his doctrine they should
teach, that Israel whiles they were in the land, being in apostasy, were not
the Lords people, nor under his covenant, nor the Lord their God, etc. whereas
they teach the contrary directly, as I have already showed by many reasons and
particulars out of their vvritings undeniably: which were long to rehearse:
and whereunto many other might be annexed. Now only let it suffice to note
these briefly: viz. that they entitle and style the Lord thus, The Lord God of
Israel: and this also in cases concerning Israel, when they were in
apostasy: as when Eliah said unto Ahab, 1 Kin. 17 1.
As the Lord God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be
dew, etc. And again in the same chapter, to the widow of Sarepta, ver. 14.
Thus says the Lord God of Israel, the barrel of meal shall not wast, etc.
And when the Prophet afterward said unto Iehu, 2 Kin. 9.6.
Thus says the Lord God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people
of the Lord, even over Israel. And the like again, 2 King. 14, 25. and many
times both in the history; and in the Prophets, both before that time and
after. For which see 1 King. 16, 13, 33. and 22, 53. 2 King. 10, 31. Hos. 4, 6.
and 12, 6, 9, 14. and 14, 1. Amos 4, 12. Mic. 6, 2 -- 8, 16. and in diverse
other places.

The like may be observed, in that they acknowledge the Lord, to be God in
Israel, and that there is no other God in all the earth besides him: As when
Eliah in Ahabs time said unto God in his prayer, 1 Kin. 18 36.
Lord God of Abraham Isaac, and Israel, Let it be known this day that thou art
God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, etc. And when Naaman the Syrian
being healed by Elisha the Prophet acknowledged, saying, 2 Kin. 5, 15.
Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. And
the like in Eliahs reproof of Ahaziah, when 2 Kin. 1, 3, 6, 16.
he sent to Baalzebub the God of Ekron, as if there were not a God in Israel.
Which also the very names that they gave their children may import, as 2 King.
10, 35.
Iehoahaz, signifying Iehovahs possession, or the Lord taking hold; 2 King. 14,
29.
Zechariah, myndful of Iah, or remembering the Lord: and the like. Yea, Achabs
children were called 1 King. 22.40.
Achaziah, possessing Jah, or taking hold on the Lord: and 2 King. 3.1.
Iehoram, Jehovah is high, etc.

Also, that the Prophets took this for a ground of their doctrines,
exhortations, promises and reproofs, that the Lord was their God, from the time
of their coming out of the land of Egypt, unto the days of Hoseah, Micah,
Amos, etc. Hos 12, 9. and 13, 4. Amo. 3, 1, 2. Mic. 6, 2 -- 8. etc. And that
the Prophets reproved them for not observing the Law of God, the New moons,
and Sabbaths, etc. Hos. 4, 6. and 8, 12. Amo. 8, 2, 5. And for making covenants
and marriages with the people of other nations, relying upon them, and not on
the Lord in their troubles, etc. Ezec. 23, 2, 5, 6. with ver. 11, 12, 13. Hos.
5, 7, 13. and 7, 8, 11. That when the Lord (being angry with Israel) had
delivered them into the hands of the kings of Syria, Iehoahaz the king of
Israel besought Jehovah the Lord; and the Lord hearkened unto him: seeing the
oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them. 2 King. 13, 3,
4. And again, that the Lord was gracious unto them, and had compassion on
them, and respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, and would not destroy them neither cast them from his presence as yet.
2 King. 13, 23. Finally, that the land of Canaan was a pledge of Gods promise
and covenant unto them, so long as he suffered them to remain therein. Hos. 9,
3, 15, 17. Amos 7, 17. with Genesis 17, 7, 8. And sundry other the like things
(more largely treated off Page 58, etc.
before) which necessarily evince that they were yet still the Lords people,
and under his covenant, and in far other estate, then the Gentiles and
nations of the world: And that the doctrine therefore of this man is notably
erroneous, and such as would make the Prophets to contradict themselves, if we
should believe him. Which God forbid. Yea, let the Prophets still be teachers
of truth (as we are sure they are) and let this man rather be a Teacher of
falsehood herein, as he has been found in some other matters besides.

Neither does he only contradict the Prophets, but himself also and his own
doctrine heretofore, if I be not mistaken in the observation thereof, when (in
mine own hearing) treating upon the books of the kings, and particularly upon
that which is written, 2 Kin. 9, 6. where the Prophet said to Iehu, Thus
says the Lord God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of
the Lord, even over Israel: he taught thereupon to this effect as follovveth:
These observations about this matter, I have noted down.
That Israel in defection, is here called the Lords people: 1. In comparison
of other nations, who were uncircumcised. 2. In respect of the Lords mercy,
who kept his covenant on his part, though they had broken it on theirs. The
Lord had not yet given the^ a bil of divorcement. 3. For that the Lord had yet
many of his people among them (1 King 19, 18. and 18, 4. 2. King. 2, 1, 3, 5,
7. and 4, 1, 8, 9, 10, 42.) 4. For that they acknowledged and professed to
serve the true God, Jehovah, though they did it after a corrupt manner: and
because they kept still diverse of his ordinances, as circumcision, etc. so as
they were upon repentance admitted to the Passover, without a new
circumcision. 2 Chro. 30 chap. Yet notvvithstanding, none might join with
Israel in that estate of apostasy, but were to depart from them, and plead
with them, etc. Hos. 2, 2. and 4, 15. Amo. 5, 4, 5. As now also, touching the
Church of Rome, etc. Rev. 18, 4.

This doctrine I wish may be well observed both of himself, and of all others,
and especially of his hearers then, and followers now: as being alone
sufficient both to convince M. Ain, Animdad. p. 67-107.
his treatise now published, of notable error and false doctrine; and on the
other hand to manifest the truth in a good measure. And of him yet more
particularly I desire, that he would seriously weigh with himself (as before
the Lord) whether he did not then teach to this effect; and so to consider,
whether now he be not contrary to himself, and contradicting the truth of his
former doctrine: as also how ready he has been, eue^ in cases of religion, to
yield to the pleasure of men (for what cause, or of what infirmity, himself
best knows:) And that therefore he would be careful to consider his ways
in his heart; and to leave his halting courses, and his schismatic walking;
and to set himself to make straight steps to his feet, least that which is lame
be turned out of the way: Which should rather be healed; that so the good
gifts which God has given him, may hereafter be employed to the churches good,
with less scandal and hinderance of the truth, then has benheretofore.

3. Other errors also may be noted here: which are again to be observed, when
we come to speak of the Scriptures which here he alleges. As namely, that he
makes the estate of Israel, vvhiles they were in the land of promise, and
under the covenant of God which he made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (as I
have shevved out of 2 King. 13, 23. Hos. 9, 3. and sundry other places:) to be
like the Gentiles, vvhiles they were strangers from the covenants of promise,
being yet uncalled, and not brought into the Lords fold. Ephesians. 2, 11, 12. with
Joh. 10, 16.

4. And that he would make Isreal's estate, whiles they were in the land of
Canaan, and before Christ's coming in the flesh: to be like the Jews present
estate, when now they are scattered abroad over the world, and cast away by
the Lord, having refused Christ exhibited, etc. 2 King. 13, 23. Hos. 9, 3, 12,
17. Romans 11, 15. 1 These. 2, 15, 16. Heb. 1, 1, 2. Of which more hereafter.

ABUSE AND VAIN ALLEGATION OF SCRIptures. And first towching 1 Samuel 30, 5. Mat.
1, 6. and 26, 6. Abuse of Scriptures.

Now next for his perverting and abusing of the Scriptures (which is common
with him throughout M. A. Animad.
the whole book, now spoken off) although enough have been noted about it
before, yet it shall not be amiss briefly here again to observe a few things
more thereabout. The first 1 Samuel 30, 5. Mat. 1, 6. and 26, 6.
three Scriptures (which speak of Abigail the wife of Nabal, of Vriahs wife,
now being David's, and of Simon the Leper) might be omitted, as being idly
alleged, to show that which no man denies, viz. that things are named in
Scripture sometime as they have been before, though they be not so still. Of
which point I have spoken in his Page 97.
Shifts here before. Only now seeing he speaks of these here, let it be
observed, whether on the one hand he himself deal not unthankfully, and
sinfully with the people of God, as Nabal did with David, and David with
Vriah: and on an other hand whether his own estate be not unlike his third
instance of Simon the Lepers, who being once cleansed from it, did so remain,
whereas himself having fallen into schism, by his own acknowledgment and being
once returned from it, straightvvay ran into that estate again, and so
continues unto this day.

Touching Hos. 2.7.
Now for the Scriptures which concern the point in hand: Hos. 2.7.
the first is, Hos. 2, 7. which himself (upon better consideration) will not
deny, but it speaks of the time of Isreal's rejection and exile, when they
should be out of the land, and of the fruit and effect thereof, for working in
them repentance, to return to the Lord their first husband, whose true
worship they had left, to follovv Idols, and from which idolatry they would
not be drawn by any admonition, forbearance, or correction, till the Lord cast
them off and drove them out of his land (as by that Chap. 1, and 3, etc.
compared with chapter 2.
which goes before, and follovveth after in this prophecy, may appear:)
whereas our question is of their estate, whiles yet they were in the land, and
vvhiles for their apostasy the Lord was still admonishing them, and with long
forbearance correcting and punishing them sundry vvayes from time to time. And
so this Scripture is not unto the point of the question in hand. Yet
notvvithstanding by this occasion note now also the Chaldee paraprase
hereupon, which expounds it thus, Chald. paraphr. in Hos. 2.
Therefore, behold, I will break off thy way, as if some should hedge (it) up
with thorns, and I will shut it up, as if some should shut it up with a wall,
that she shall not find her paths. She shall in deed follow after peace with
the peoples, that they may be her friends, but she shall not obteyn them: and
she shall seek help, but she shall not find it: then shall she say with her
self, I will go and return to the worship of my former Lord: For it was
better with me when I worshipped him, then now. I will not worship idols
hereafter. Where it may be observed, how this paraphrase expounds, the
forsaking or returning to the Lord, of forsaking or returning to the true
warship of God. Which is also usual throughout that paraphrase. The
observation whereof, vvil give great light to the understanding of many
Scriptures, and clearing of sundry questions. And these things, this man
himself knows very well: and can give light from thence othervvhere, in such
places and matters, where his own errors and opinions are not convinced
thereby: as his other M. Ain. Annot. on Genesis Exodus Psalm. etc.
better writings sufficiently manifest.

Touching Hos. 1.9.
The next Scripture is Hos. 1, 9. which being duly observed, will also prove
to be against himself. Hos. 1.9.
Whereabout I must repeat some things noted here Page 77, etc.
before. For touching this matter it is still to be remembered, that this
prophet prophesied in the days of Jeroboam the son of Ioash, Iehues great
grandchild: (who was the thirteenth king of Israel from Jeroboam the son of
Nebat that caused Israel to sin.) Now all that time he foreshewed, how Gomer
(which is Israel) should bring forth three children; the first, the Prophet
should call, Hos. 1, 4.
Jezreel, noting the taking away of the kingdom of Israel from the house of
Iehu, for the blood shed by him in the valley of Iezreell. The accomplishment
whereof came afterward to pass in the days of Zachariah (who was of Iehues
posterity, and the fourth king after him) as was now foretold in his fathers
days. For which see 2 King. 15, 8, 9. 10. etc. The second child, the Prophet
should call, Hos. 1, 6.
Lo-ruhamah, not obteyning mercy; noting the calamity, that should yet further
come upon Israel, when they not obteyning mercy, should be delivered into the
hands of Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, and a great part of them be carried
away captive: as came to pass afterward in the days of Pekah (the eightenth
king of Israel from Jeroboam the first) 2 King. 15, 27, 28, 29. and 1 Chronicles.
5, 25, 26. The third child, the Prophet should call, Hos. 1, 9.
Lo-ammi, not my people: noting yet far greater misery which should come
upon Israel, when they should be cast out of the Lords land, and wander among
the nations, as other people: who had before ben the Lords people, and he their
God, that had hitherto kept them in his land, as his people in his own house
and presence: but now would cast them off and scatter them among the Gentiles.
As came to pass, in the days off Hoseah the last king of Israel, about two
hundred and forty years, from Isreal's falling into apostasy, when they
^^^sined and divided themselves from Judah, in the days of Jeroboam the son
of Nebat that caused Israel to sin. 2 King. 17, 1 -- 6. etc. And so Hos. 1,
9.
this Scripture also is not to the point in hand: our question being concerning
the estate of Israel, whiles yet they were in the land, all the years and kings
days aforesaid, until the child, Not my people.
Lo-ammi (now spoken off) was borne, and they came to the estate signified by
this name, not to be the people of the Lord, nor to have him to be their God,
to defend, help, and deliver them, as formerly he had done. Whereabout I have
treated more largely P. 78, etc
before: and needed not now again to have handled this matter (though thus
briefly:) but that here he alleges this Scripture in particular, and
shuffleth together the diverse times and estates of Israel: which are
carefully to be distinguished for the right understanding of the Scriptures,
and better fynding out of the truth in the things aforesaid.

And here again it shall not be amiss, to note, how the Chaldee paraphrase
expounds and speaks of these things, as follows. Jonathae Chald.
paeraphr. in Hose. 1, 2 -- 9.
The Lord said unto Hoseah, Go declare a prophecy against the inhabitants of
the city given to adultery, which heap sins upon sins. For now Note this.
a long time have the inhabitants of this city go^e a whoring, forsaking N. B.
the worship of the Lord. 3. He went therefore and prophesied against them,
that if they did return, they should be forgiven: but if not, that as the
leaves of the fig tree, fade, so they should fade away. But they committed
evil deeds more excedingly. 4. Therefore the Lord said unto him, Give them this
name, [Dispersed.] For after a little while, I will show, that I remember the
blood of the idolaters, which Iehu shed in Iezreell, who in deed flewe them,
because they were worshippers of Baal, but Iehu himself and his children again
went astray after the calves of Bethell. Wherefore I will impute that blood, as
innocent blood, unto the posterity of Iehu, and will ta^e away the kingdom
from the family of Israel. 5. At that time also will I break the strength of
the warriors of Israel in the valley of Iezreel. 6. But they did evil works
more and more. Then the Lord said unto him, Give them this name, that [they are
not beloved,] because of their works: For I will not be brought hereafter, again
to love the children of Israel. Yet if they repent, I will surely forgive
them. 7. And I will love the family of Judah, and will deliver them by the word
of the Lord their God: But they shall not be delivered by bow or sword, or men
of war, horses or horsemen. 8. But their children, N B*
after they were carried away captive into exile, were found among the peoples
not to be dear unto God because of their works: yet they added mo unto their
former evil deeds. 9. Therefore (the Lord said to Hoseah, Give them this name,
[Not my people.] For you are not my people: Seeing you observe not the words of
my law, my word shall not be your help. Where we may observe these things: 1.
That this prophecy was given, when they had already a long time gone a whoring
from God, forsaking the worship of the Lord. 2. That the Paraphrast expounds
their departing from the Lord to be the forsaking of his worship: as they also
expound their returning to their first husband spoken of chapter 2, 7.) to be the
returning to the worship of their first Lord. 3. That these things now
denounced, were to come upon them yet afterward. 4. And that also by degrees,
and in succession of time, one after another. 5. And the last, of not being his
people, referred to the time, Which others refer to the time, when they were
first put out of the la^d, in king Hoseah^ days.
after they were carried away captive into exile: when there also they added mo
iniquities to their former evil deeds. Whereas our controversy is, about the
estate of Israel for the time of their apostasy, while they were in the land,
when Jeroboam had set up the calves, until they were cast out: as is
aforesaid. And thus much now again, of this Scripture, in Hos. 1, 9.

Touching Hos. 2.2.
Then follovveth Hos. 2, 2. Of which I have spoken here before: p. 77, etc. Now
only I annex this withal. Hos 4, 1. Mic. 6, 2. with Ezec. 20, 4 -- 36. and
22, 2. and 23, 36 etc.
First, that seeing here it is said, Plead with your Mother, Plead, etc. this
may lead us to consider, that the Lord now was yet still admonishing them, and
pleading with them: as he had done before sundry times and vvayes, like as with
Judah also: and as sinners by the Lords ordinance) are to be dealt with, before
they be proceeded against. All know, that in ordinary course of proceeding in
all churches well ordered, such as fall into sin (though but particular
persons) are notwithstanding still esteemed of the church, until such time as
despising the means used, and being found obstinate, they be cast out of the
church and house of God. How much more would the Lord have this observed,
toward an whole church, yea toward so many tribes, cities, and synagogues,
as perteyned to Israel, the mother here spoken off? And what then shall we
conclude hereupon, tovvching the point in question?

Secondly, Mercerus. Drusius, etc. ^n Hos. 2, 2.
some understand it of the rejection of the Jews, when they had refused Christ
exhibited in the flesh: thinking that this sermon of the Prophets was needful
for the comforting of the believers at that time, least they also should
forsake Christ, being affected with the offense and stumbling of the multitude
of the Jews, that so refused him. And Calvin, Zanchius, etc. in Hos. 2, 2.
others understanding it of the ten tribes, expound it thus: Plead with your
mother, plead: He speaks here in the person of God. Now God uses the
similitude of marriage. So let us see what is the sum of the words. If an
husband make a divorce with his wife, he brings some note of ignominy upon
their children, which are borne of that marriage. Their mother is put away,
therefore the children are less esteemed because of the divorce. If the
husband of frowardness put away his wife from him, the children justly hate
him. What? He loved not our mother as he ought: he kept not the says and bond
of marriage. This therefore is usual, that the childrens mynds are alienated
from the Father, if he deal with the mother inhumanely, or else altogether
contumeliously. Thus the Israelites, when they savv that they were rejected,
would lay the blame upon God. For the people here is called the [Mother:] that
is, the name of the mother is transferred to the body of the people, or to the
stock of Abraham. God had espoused that people to himself, and would have them
to be as his wife. Seeing therefore God was the husband of the people, the
Israelites were as the children begotten of that marriage. Now after the
divorce, the Israelites said, that God was cruel, because he had cast them
away without their fault. The Prophet now therefore undertakes the defense
of Gods cause: and yet speaks in his person, Plead [saith he] plead with your
mother. Finally this place agrees with Esa. 50. There it is said in the
beginning of the chapter, Where is the bill of divorce? Have I sold you to my
Creditors? But you are sold for your sins, and your mother is put away for
her iniquity. etc. And this all know was spoken by Esaias to Judah, or the Jews
generally.

Zanchius also writing on Hos. 2, 2. notes this in like sort for the argument
and sum of this matter. The Prophet (says he) teaches, that there was no
cause why the Israelites should expostulate with God, that he in putting
away their mother the Synagogue, did note each of them also with this mark
of infamy, that they were borne of fornication. For the whole cause of this
evil and infamy, was to be ascribed to their mother, to wit, their open and
continual fornication, joined together with untollerable unthankfulnes
toward God. etc.

Thus both the one and the other apply it to the rejection of Israel though
the one refer it to the time before Christ, the other to the time after. And
then it touches not the question in hand.

Touching 2 Chronicles. 15, 3.
The next Scripture here cited, is 2 Chronicles, 15, 3. Of which also I have spoken
here before: page 65, etc. To which I refer the Reader: 2 Chronicles. 15, 3.
wishing this vvithall to be observed and remembered, how the Chaldee
Paraphrase and other vvriters expound such places and phrases of speech of the
following of idols, and leaving the true and right worship of God. A sin, not
peculiar only to Israel, but often found also in Judah, and in all the tribes
together: as I have shevved before. Touching whom I suppose they will make no
such conclusions thereupon, as here they do of Israel.

Touching Mica. 2, 7, 8.
Now next follows, that which is written, Micah. 2, 7, 8. Mic. 2, 7, 8.
which may be understood either generally of the whole people of Israel, that
is, both of the ten tribes, and of Judah; or of either of them severally: and
every way makes against these men themselves. For if it be understood of all
the tribes and people generally: then it makes not more against the ten
tribes, then it does also against Judah; which themselves acknowledge were at
this time the people and church of God, and under his covenant.

That it may be understood of them both jointly, these reasons may induce: 1.
That this Prophet denounces judgment in this prophecy to both of them (both
upon Judah and Israel) for their sins: as the title and process of his book
shows. The title, which is this, Mic. 1, 1.
The word of the Lord that came to Micah, in the days of Iotham, Ahaz, and
Hezekiah kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria (the chief city of
Israel) and Jerusalem (the chief city of Judah) Mic. 1, 1. The process, in
the course of his proceeding, and often joining them together: for which see
these and the like places, which would be long here to write down, Mic. 1,
5, 6, 9, 13. and 2, 4, 5, 12. and 3, 1, 9, 10, 11, 12. and 6, 2, 3, 4. etc. 2.
That in this chapter, he speaks of that family, and expressly uses the
term of a family: ver. 3. compared with Amos 3, 1. and Mica. 6, 2, 3, 4. and
the phrase, of casting a cord by lot in the Congregation of the Lord. Which may
have reference to the ancient dividing of the land by lot among all the
tribes, in Iosuahs time. Mic. 2, 5. compared with Ios. 14, 1. and 15, 1. etc.
Deuteronomy. 32, 9. As also the general terms both of the house of Jacob, Mic. 2, 7.
being compared with Mic. 1, 1. and 3, 1, 8. and 6, 2, 3, 4. and Amos 3, 1, 13.
Luke 1, 33. and of the people of God: Mica. 2.8, 9. and 3.1, 3, 5. and 6, 2, 3.
etc. 3. That the things going before and follovving in the chapter alleged,
may be applied to all the tribes (both Israel and Judah:) viz. the sins of
oppressing the poor, and of approving such prophets as taught according to the
peoples lust, and liking, Mic. 2, 1 -- 11. and the punishment of exile and
departure out of the land denounced thereupon, Mic. 2, 10, etc. Not to speak
how Tremellius and Iunius join all the first five chapters of this prophecy
together, as making but one sermon, directed to Judah and Israel, and
denouncing the overthrow of both the kingdoms, because of their sins. And so
then their reasoning from hence, is as well against Judah as against Israel.

Or if it be understood of the ten tribes of Israel more particularly (as here
they apply it; and so may it be:) then also consider, whether the same people
be not in the same chapter a little before called the congregation of the Lord:
And that not only in their own persuasion and profession, but in the Lords
and the Prophets account. Mic. 2, 5. Which speech is the more to be minded,
being such as would soon end this controversy, if they be acknowledged now
at this time, to have been the Church of the Lord: it being at least about two
hundred years after Jeroboam had set up the calves, and so long after Isreal's
apostasy here spoken off. For if they grant them to be the church of the
Lord, I suppose they will not deny them to be the people of the Lord, or his
wife; neither will affirm hereafter, that the circumcision and other
ordinances of God retained among them, were in their use false, deceitful, and
execrable signs and seals, and no better then the ordinances retained among
the Heathens. They will (I hope) be better advised, then thus to speak of the
Lords ordinances, had and retained in the Lords Church; and will now at length
learn to put difference between the Lords ordinances themselves, and his
peoples abuse or corruptions thereabout; also betvveen the Lords church and
ordinances, and the Pagans assemblies and abominations; yea and between the
Lords church sometimes walking in syncerity, and the same church of the Lord
coming to be corrupted with idolatry or other transgressions, and so fallen
into apostasy, as Israel now was, and Judah also sometime. Esa. 1, 21.

Secondly, the phrase of being named, called, or said to be, is sometimes also
put for that which in deed is, or may be so accounted: as in Esa. 44, 5. Ier.
23, 6. and 33, 16. Joh. 13, 13. and the like places. And so the Chaldee
paraphrase here expounds it: Yet so I will not here urge it. But taking it,
that Israel was here called the house of Jacob, and the people of God in
respect of their own profession, that would be so esteemed: yet this does not
hinder, but that also they were so in deed, albeit they did not walk
accordingly, as they ought to have done. For if we understand it thus, O thou
that art named the house of Jacob, that is, O thou that gloryest that thou art
descended of Jacob, and yet do not walk in his steps: will it therefore
follow, that they were not in deed descended of him, or were not the house of
Jacob, etc. See it in another case. Esaias the Prophet speaking of Judah, says:
Esa. 48, 1, 2.
Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called (or, call themselves) by the
name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear
by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in
truth nor in righteousness: For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay
themselves (that is, profess that they stay) upon the God of Israel, etc. Was
not Judah now therefore the house of Jacob, nor come out of the waters of
Judah? Or were they not therefore the Lords people, nor his wife: because of
this hypocritical profession of theirs? Or were they in deed without the true
God, as he understands and speaks it here concerning Israel? And note,
that Esaias here has the same term of the house of God, that Micah has in the
other place. Again, the Jews in Christ's time, said, Mat. 3, 9. Joh. 8, 39.
they had Abraham to their Father: and herein they gloryed: but they did not
the works of Abraham, as Christ told them. Yet Christ acknowledges them Joh.
8, 37.
to be Abraham's seed, though they sought to kill him, which Abraham did not:
and so were not in this respect Ioh. 8, 39 40, 44.
the children of Abraham, but of the devil: and Matt. 3, 7.9.
a generation of vipers, as John Baptist also called them: and yet never
denied, that Abraham was their father; and they the church of God now also at
this time. So both these may stand together: that a people may glory in this,
that they are the house of Jacob, the people of Israel, the seed of Abraham,
the church of God, etc. and be so also indeed: and yet not walk as they ought,
according to that estate, whereof they do so glory and boast themselves. For
who knows not that many do often boast vainly of those things, which yet
they have truly: but walk not worthy of them as they should? Many in Judah
Zeph. 3.11.
were haughty, because of the Lords holy mountain. Had they it not therefore
in deed among them? Though yet they did not walk worthy thereof: For which
they were punished. Zeph. 1, and 3 chap. And many the like still are found in
other churches from time to time: who notvvithstanding are to be accounted the
people of God, and members of the churches of God, vvhiles they so remain:
though yet they walk unvvorthy of that estate and favor of God. For which
also see Mal. 1, 6, 7, 8, etc.

Thirdly, if it were true (as this man here pleads) that Israel now was
not Gods people, but only so called in respect of their own profession, that
they would be so esteemed and named: then should the main force of the
Prophets reproof be weakened, and the finne both of the people and governors of
Israel be far less, and of another sort and nature, then it was in deed and
in truth. As namely, when the Lord speaking by the Prophet, says. Mic. 2, 8.
Even of late (or, yesterday) my people is risen up as an enemy. And in the
next verse, ver. 9.
The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses. And in the
next chapter, Mic. 3, 1 2, 3.
Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel:
is it not for you to know judgment? who hate the good and love the evil; who
also eat the flesh of my people, etc. And again, ver. 5.
Thus says the Lord concerning the Prophets or, that deceive my people.
that make my people err, that bite with their teeth and cry, Peace, etc. In
which places and the like any may perceive, that both the Lords reproofs, and
Isreal's sins are the greater, because they were the Lords people, that did
these things, and unto whom they were done. Where upon one vvriting
hereabout, observes and urges it, as a point of special weight, in this
sort: Calvin in Mic. 3, 5. with v. 1, and 3.
The indignity is increased, seeing this injury is done to the people of God.
If the Assyrians or Ethiopians, or Egyptians, had been spoiled of their princes,
this had been more tolerable: but whenas the people of God it self is so
cruelly devoured, this is less sufferable. So where the people of God is
deceived, and the truth is turned into a lie, this sacrilege is more
detestable. This therefore is the reason why he says, [They which deceive my
people:] This people is holy unto me: for I have chosen them to my self: when
therefore it is corrupted with fraud and deceit, is not even mine own majesty
after a sort violated? is not my soverainty diminished? Now therefore we
perceive, why the Prophet says, [They deceive my people.] In deed it is sure
that the Jews were worthy to be so deceived, Deuteronomy. 13.
as God also otherwhere says, that he makes trial, what the people is,
whenever he suffers false prophets among them. This therefore was a just
recompense, that then Satan had liberty given, to pervert sound doctrine among
the people. And none is ever deceived, but willingly and of their own accord.
Although many seem to be drawn to destruction through their own simplicity,
yet alvvayes there is some hypocrisy withal. But this does not lessen the
fault in the false teachers if the people deserve such punishment: Therefore
the Prophet does nevertheles proceed in his reproof, and says that this was
[the people of God.] How? truly by adoption. Although the Jews therefore carried
themselves unworthy of so great honor, yet God accounts them among his
people, that he may punish in false teachers the wickedness, which now he
accuses in them. Hitherto M. Calvin, in his Commentary on Mic. 3, 5. Now how
contrary doctrine, and how false, the Teacher (with whom we have to deal,)
publishes hereabout: I wish both himself and his followers well to observe,
with the consequences thereof. And what if another or himself would except in
like sort touching Judah (as he does touching Israel) when we allege the
like concerning them out of Jeremy the Prophet, where speaking of the Priests
and Prophets false dealing, he says, Ier. 6, 14. and 8, 11.
They have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying,
Peace, peace, when there is no peace. If now another should say, that Judah
was called the people of God, in respect of their profession, that they would
be so esteemed and named, though in deed they were not so: and would also
plead it the more, because they had now Not relying upon him, and worshipping
him, according to his word.
forsaken the true God, Ier. 2, 13 with v. 2.
the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisternes, broken cisternes
that could hold no water: and so infer that neither Israel nor Judah was
now the people of God: Where then may we think, was the Church of God in those
days, and where was the Lords ordinance of circumcision to be had? How
greatly also should they by this means weaken the Prophets reproofs, and
lessen the sins of that people: if they were not in deed the people of God,
as has been said?

Fourthly, according to their assertion, they might also tell us, that those
whom Micah in the next chapter calls Mic, 3, 1, 9.
the heads of Jacob, and the princes of the house of Israel, were not so in
deed, but only in their own persuasion and profession: and thus might pervert
any terms and phrases of the Scripture, at their pleasure.

They might have observed also touching one of the verses here alleged, how
the new Translation in our toungue has it thus, Even of late my people is
risen up as an enemy: and how it follows presently in the next verse, The
women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses, etc. The
observation vvherof might have drawn them to a further consideration
hereabout: Specially being compared with the use of the same term, in the
other places mentioned, Mic. 3, 1, 3, 5. and in 6, 2, 3, etc. But his vvoonted
passing over of some places, and perverting of other, not regarding what goes
before or follovveth after, and so laying some words together, as may seem best
to serve his turn, and using any pretenses he can for the more color
thereabout: these things I leave to be considered by the judicious readers,
that are able and careful to observe them.

And now only for a conclusion of this point, I will note here the
exposition of the Chaldee paraphrase, Chal. paraphr. in Mic. 2, 7, 8.
in the verses here cited by himself: which (after the interpretation of the
sixth verse, thus: Prophecy not at all, neither teach this people: seeing they
endure not to be bovved) expounds the 7 and 8 verses after this manner, Is it
thus right, say the children (or, posterity) of Jacob? Should the word of the
Lord be made void? Are these his works? Are not al my sayings right? that which
I said should come to pass, have I brought it to pass on them that walk
aright. 8. My people for their sins is delivered unto the adversary: the
nations stand up against them, etc. And hitherto of the application hereof unto
Israel.

Now if this Scripture be understood of Judah, then the inferences that he
brings from hence upon Israel, will fall upon Judah. Which yet himself
acknowledges was now the church and people of God. And that it may thus be
understood and applied to Judah, these reasons may show. 1. The Mic. 1, 1.
title of the prophecy, directs it as well to Jerusalem (of Judah) as to
Samaria, of Israel.

2. Diverse particular speeches in the prophecy it self: as when he says in the
first chapter, Mic. 1, 5.
What are the high places of Judah, are they not Jerusalem? Again, ver. 9.
Her wound is incurable, for it is come unto Judah: he is come unto the gate of
my people, even to Jerusalem. And again, ver. 13.
O thou inhabitant of Lachish (a city of Judah) bynd the charet to the swift
beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the
transgressions of Israel were found in thee. And in the second chapter, and
the verses here alleged, the general terms Cha. 2, 3. 5, 7, 8, 9.
of the house of Jacob, and the people of the Lord, etc. And that these and the
like terms are in the Scriptures diverse times put for Judah, none vvil deny.
Among many other places, see these, towching the term Jacob, and the house of
Jacob, Esa. 8, 17. and 48, 1. Jer. 5, 20. Lam. 1, 17. and 2, 2. Obad. v. 10.
and 11. Mic. 2, 12. and 3, 1, 8, 9. Nahum 2, 2. And for the term of the people
of the Lord, applied to Judah, Jer. 2, 11, 13, 31, 32. and 4, 11, 22. and 5,
31. and 6, 27. and 8, 7. and 23, 2, 22, 27, 32. Ezech. 13, 10, 18, 19. Joel. 2,
17, 18, 19, 26. Obad. v. 13. Zeph. 2, 10. and in an hundred places besides.

3. The particular terms of Zion,, Jerusalem, the mountayn of the Lords house,
and the like used in this prophecy. Mic. 3, 9, 10, 12. and 4, 7, 8, etc.

4. The sharp denunciation uttered by Micah, where he says: Zion for your sake
shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain
of the house, as the high places of the forest: Mic. 3, 12. is expressly noted,
to have been spoken in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, to all the people of
Judah, Jer. 26, 18. which is very specially to be observed.

5. The direct and particular mention, that the daughter of Zion shall go
forth of the city (Jerusalem) even unto Babylon. Mic. 4, 10.

By all which, and the like that in this Prophet may be observed, it can not
be denied but that this prophecy was directed to Judah as well as to Israel.
Whither also may be referred the general reasons here Page 105.
before alleged, concerning them both. Whereupon will follow (upon these
men's assertion) that if the Scriptures here cited by them will bear their
inference, and be applied to Judah, that they then were not the church and
people of God neither, however they would be so esteemed and named. And so
whatsoever they would bring upon Israel in this behalf, is now by themselves
brought upon Judah: so as Judah (by their assertions) was not now the Lords,
not the people of the Lord, nor his wife, nor under his covenant, nor a true
church, nor had circumcision, or other ordinances of the Lord, that were the
Lords signs and seals of his covenant and forgiveness of sins, but such a
were in their use false and deceitful, cursed and detestable, and what not,
if we should believe their assertions and conclusions. But whether in deed
such stuff and dealing of theirs, be not rather to be esteemed false and
deceitful, accursed and detestable, let the godly wise judge.

Touching Hos. 2.18.19.20.23.
The next Scriptures here alleged, are Hos. 2, 18, 19, 20, 23. which speak of
the time to come after their exile and casting out of the land, Hos. 2, 18.19,
20, 23.
when they should again return unto the Lord (agreeing with that which
follows in the next chapter, Hos. 3, 4, 5.) whereas our question is of their
estate and condition with the Lord, vvhiles they were yet in the land; and
not cast out of his house or presence as yet, but beloved, pitied, and helped
of the Lord: as appears by that which went before and follovveth after in
this prophecy of Hoseah, and by the history it self, 2 Kin. 13, 23. and 14,
25, 26, 27. and in many other places both of the history, and of the Prophets:
as Page 58. etc.
here before I have shevved in sundry particulars: which I need not repeat.

Touching Ioh. 10.16. Act. 18, 10. 1 Cor. 12, 2. Romans 11, 11, 20, 23.25, 26.
and 9, 4. with Esa. 59, 20, 21. Ezech. 34, 23 -- 30. Hos. 3, 5.
By this also may appear, how that which he annexeth, of the Gentiles called
Christ's sheep, because they should be brought into his fold; and of the Jews
called Gods people and beloved, because they shall be graffed again into Christ:
is not to the point and question in hand. And so the Scriptures also which
here they cite, abused in this behalf. viz. Ioh. 10, 16. Act. 18, 10. 1 Cor,
12, 2. Romans 11, 11, 20, 23, 25, 26. and 9, 4. with Esa. 59, 20, 21. Ezec. 34,
23 -- 30. Hos. 3, 5. inasmuch as they speak of the estate of Jews and
Gentiles for time to come; whereas our question, and the Scriptures speeches
alleged by us, are of Israel, for the time then present, when now they
were in the land of promise, not cast out by the Lord as yet. Which may
suffice for a full answer hereunto. Yet some other things also may be noted,
that vvil give further light and confirmation hereunto.

As first, that thus he would make Isreal's estate, vvhiles yet they remained
in the land of promise, and under the Lords covenant, having also the great
things of his law written unto them, etc. to be like the estate of the
Heathens, vvhiles they were strangers from the covenants of promise, and had
not the word and statutes of the Lord given unto them: etc. Which I have noted
here before among his errors.

Secondly, that he makes the estate of Israel, vvhiles they were in the Lords
land, and before Christ was exhibited (as is aforesaid:) to be like the estate
of the Jews at this day, when they are now cast away for a time and some
of the branches broken of, Christ being come in the flesh, and refused by
them, etc. Romans 11, 11, 12, 15, 17, 20, 25.

Thirdly, that in this treatise of his, he so speaks of Israel of old, and
of the Jews at this day: as if the Lords covenant, even on his part, were not
an everlasting covenant, stable and enduring for ever, concerning them. Whereas
the Lord himself says, I will establish my covenant betvveen me and thee
(speaking to Abraham) and thy seed after thee, in their generations for an
everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. Genesis
17, 7.

And afterward again to David, I have made a covenant with my chosen: I have
sworn unto David my servant. Thy seed will I stablish for ever: and build up
thy throne to all generations. My mercy will I keep for him for evermore: and
my covenant shall stand fast with him. His seed also will I make to endure for
ever: and his throne as the days of heaven. Note this well.
If his children forsake my law and walk not in my judgments: if they break (or
profane) my Statutes, and keep not my commandments: then will I visit their
transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless,
my loving kindness will I not make frustrate with him, nor lie (or, deal
falsely) against my faithfulness. Note th^^ well.
My covenant will I not break (or, profane:) nor alter the thing that is gone
gone out of my lips, etc. Psa. 89, 3, 4.28, 29, 30. etc. And again in the
Psalms, He will remember his covenant for ever. He sent redemption unto his
people: he has commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his Name.
Psalm. 111.5.9. And in Ezechiell the Prophet. Thus says the Lord God, I will
even deal with thee as thou have done, which have despised the oath in
breaking the Covenant. Nevertheles I will remember my Covenant with thee in the
days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting Covenant. Then
thou shall remember thy ways and be ashamed, when thou shall receive thy
sisters, thy elder and thy younger, and I will give them unto thee for
daughters, but not by thy Covenant. And I will establish my Covenant with
thee, and thou shall know that I am the Lord: That thou may remember, and be
confounded, and never open thy mouth any more: because of thy shame, when I am
pacified toward thee, for all that thou have done, says the Lord God. Ezec.
16.59 -- 63. [And in Esaias the Prophet, The mountains shall depart, and the
hills be removed: but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the
covenant of my peace be removed, says the Lord that has mercy on thee. Esa.
54.10. [And again,] The Redeemer shall come to Sion, and unto them that turn
from transgression in Jacob, says the Lord. As for me, this is my covenant
with them, says the Lord, My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I
have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth
of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed, says the Lord, from
henceforth, and for ever. Esa. 59.20.21. with Romans 11.25.26.27. which last
places (except the last verse) are here mentioned by himself.

And agreeably with the Prophets, the Apostles also (speaking of the Jews,
and of Gods dealing with them) teach us, that the gifts and calling of God are
without repentance, such as he cannot repent of and alter. Romans 11, 29. And it
were endless to note all the places, and gather the manifold reasons and
assertions, which the Prophets and Apostles have hereabout.

Now for the point it self (considering the perverseness and wrangling
disposition of many) I had rather propound what others have observed concerning
it, then further deliver mine own mind, or insist longer thereupon. Mark
therefore what M. Calvin says touching this matter: Calvin in Ier. 2, 2.
writing upon Ier. 2, 2. This is a very worthy place (says he) because God
shows that his covenant, though it were perfidiouslly violated by the
Jews, yet is firm and stable. For although not al, Romans 11, 25.
that come of Abraham according to the flesh be true and right Israelites: yet
God alvvaies abides true, and his calling is without repentance, as Paul
teaches.

And again, writing upon Ezech. 16, 61. Calvin in. Zac. 10, 6.
The Lord said a little before, [I will remember my covenant:] now he says,
[not by thy covenant.] He reconcileth therefore those things that might seem
contrary: to wit, that himself would be myndfull of his covenant, and yet that
covenant to be dissipated, broken, and abolished. He shows that the covenant
is firm on his part (as men use to speak:) but is void on the peoples part.

And on Zath. 10, 6. " Whereas here God says, that he cast away his people, it
must be referred to the sense and opinion of men, as otherwhere we have seen:
for the adoption was stable: but the outvvard appearance might give another
judgment, namely that that people was rejected of God. But yet the Prophets
meaning is clear, to wit, that although God had dealt severely with that
people, and had most grievously punished their perfidiousnes, yet the
avengement should not be eternal, because he will give place to his mercy.
Again he annexeth the reason, [because I am the Lord their God, says he.] By
this clause he signifies that the adoption is not void, although for a time he
cast away the Jews. For calling himself [their God,] he sets before us the
remembrance of his covenant: as if he should say, that he did not in vain make
covenant with Abraham, and promised that his seed should be blessed. Therefore
because God bound himself by promise to Abraham, here he says [he is that
peoples God:] not that he ought any thing unto them, but because of his free
grace he chose as well Abraham as his seed. etc.

Many the like sayings and observations, might be noted also out of other
writers. But omitting them, I will rather note somewhat out of the Scriptures
here alleged by themselves. As namely, in Romans 11, 11. where Paul speaking of
the present estate of the Jews, who refused Christ being exhibited in the
flesh: says thus, Romans 11, 11.
Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid. Whereas by these men's
doctrine, Israel had so stumbled and fallen, as even before Christ's coming,
whiles they remained in the land of promise, they were not Gods people, and
under his covenant, etc.

And in Romans 11, 20. the Apostle speaking of the estate of the Jews at this
day, says: Romans 11, 20.
Because of unbelief they were broken off. But shall their unbelief make the
faith of God without effect? God forbid. Yea, let God be true, but every man a
liar: as the Apostle teaches othervvhere, Romans 3, 3.4. and here again
annexeth, that they also, if they bide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed
in: for God is able to graffe them in again. Romans 11, 23.

Romans 11, 25.
And Romans 11, 25. adds further, I would not brethren (speaking to the
Gentiles) that ye should be ignorant of this mystery (least ye should be wise
in your own conceits) that blyndnes in part is happened to Israel, until the
fullness of the Gentiles be come in. In part (he says) not totally or finally:
and on their part, through their unbelief: whereas the faith and covenant of
the Lord, on his part, is firm and stable for ever: who therefore will graffe
the Jews (the natural branches) into their own Olive tree again: And so
all Israel shall be saved, as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the
Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodlines from Jacob. Romans 11.26. Where also
the term of Jacob, calls to remembrance both the Lords covenant made with
Jacob, and the stability thereof for ever. Genesis 28, 13, 14, 15. Psalm. 47, 4.
and 105, 8, 9, 10. Amo. 7, 2, 5. Luke 1, 54, 55, 72, 73. Heb. 6, 17, 18. and
11, 9, 16.

Which this man himself (if he would have set himself to observe it) could
have noted out of the very next words, in the same place which here he
alleges: where presently it follows, For this is my covenant unto them,
when I shall take away their sins. Romans 11, 27. where he speaks
expressly of the Lords covenant unto them, showing both the stability thereof,
and making it the fountain and ground of this mercy of the Lord unto them.
Like as also in the next verses follovving, he does yet further declare and
confirm it, when he says: As concerning the Gospel, they are enemies for
your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers
sakes. For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. Romans 11, 28,
29.

Upon which Scripture, M. Beza writes thus: Bez. Annot. in Romans 11, 28.
This place does manifestly show, that Paul treats not of every particular
Jew, but of the Jewish nation in general, who as touching the Gospel, that is,
inasmuch as it admits not the Gospel, to wit, in their present estate, are
[enemies, or] hateful to God: but as touching the election (that is, inasmuch
as God considers not what they deserve but what himself promised to Abraham
and his seed are beloved of God, and therefore will he in his time vouchsafe
them his grace and favor: because, although every man be a liar, yet Note
these things.
God will not change his counsel. And this is a most firm argument, as being
such which is taken from the very nature of God. But this is to be noted again,
that here the treating is of the Jewish nation in general, and of Note these
things.
the perpetual covenant. For God has his decrees touching particulars, which
derogate not from that generality, though they be contrary: as for example,
that God has chosen the Jews, and yet has appointed diverse of them to just
destruction. Also he decrees many things for a time, which afterward he
changes. Yet is he not therefore to be esteemed changeable, but rather
always like himself: because that the things which he has decreed should be
perpetual (as, Note these things.
this covenant with Abraham and his seed) they remain perpetual: but the
things which he has decreed to be changed in their times (as we see the
interchangeable and succeeding course of things every moment:) or to be
abrogated, (as is come to pass with the legal ceremonies) they also at their
certain times are changed and abrogated.

Hitherto M. Beza. And whether the man with whom we have to do, did not
observe thus much himself, may be doubted. Else when here he cites, Romans 11,
11, 20, 23, 25, 26. why should he stay there, and not cite also the next
verses, ver. 27, 28, 29. specially seeing the term (beloved) now attributed to
the Jews (on which here he insisteth) is not in any of the verses which he
alleges; but is used in ver. 28, which he omitteth. Which if he had but
cited, and the Reader observed, he should have found together with mention of
the term beloved, the ground also and reason thereof to be Gods election, and
the covenant made with their Fathers, and that unchangeably. ver. 28, with 27,
and 29. All which do both manifest his shifts, and convince his erroneous
assertions, concerning Israel.

Here also is to be observed, how speaking of the Jews now to be beloved:
besides that he cites not the verse, where that term is used, he also leaves
the phrases of speech used by the Apostle in the same verse: which are these,
Romans 11, 28.
As concerning the Gospel, the Jews are enemies (for which he has, their
present estate is cursed) for your sake: but as touching the election, they are
beloved for the fathers sakes: For which he has (omitting wholy the term of
election) for the promise that they shall hereafter be graffed again into
Christ. Whereas if he had kept the terms used by the Apostle in the same
verse, the matter would have been plainer against himself, touching the
eternity and unchangeablenes of Gods election and covenant, on which we insist.
If he say, that Paul in the same chapter also uses the phrase of graffing them
again: I deny it not. But he uses it not in this verse now spoken off, where
he shows how they are beloved, for the fathers sakes, and so for the
covenant, in regard of Gods election. Romans 11, 28. And where he speaks of
their graffing in again, it is in respect of their being broken off through
their unbelief and disobedience of the Gospel. Romans 11, 20.23. And this also,
but of some of the branches, not of the whole tree. Romans 11, 16. Besides that
man's unbelief cannot make the faith of God to be of none effect. Romans 3, 3, 4.
2 Timothy 2, 13.

And by this occasion note here, how the same persons (the Jews) are enemies
in one respect, and beloved in another respect: Enemies, in themselves;
beloved, of the Lord: Enemies, because of their unbelief, and refusal of the
Gospel; beloved because of the election, and covenant of the Lord made with
the Fathers and their seed. Romans 11, 28. And consequently, how good and
needful it is (as cases require it) to consider and speak of the same persons
diversely, in diverse respects: As also, to put difference in the consideration
of the covenant, betvveen that which concerns the Lord, on his part; and that
which concerns man, on theirs. Which when we do (upon some occasions)
touching Israel, the church of Rome, or others in like sort: how common then
is it with these men to open the throat, and fill their mouths with odious
exclamations. But let them henceforth be more careful to lay their hand on
their mouth, and to learn better, even by this distinction and manner of
speech, which the Apostle has Romans 11, 28.
in this place: besides infinite other the like throughout the Scriptures:
whereof I have given some instances ^^ert. p. ^4.
otherwhere.

Unto which I will here now also annex these: That the Jews who for 2 Kin. 24
^, etc. Ier. 11. and 13 and 14. and 15, and 18, and 22 chapter etc. Dan. 9, 2.5.
etc.
their sins and wickedness were carried captive to Babylon, in Iechoniahs
time, are called good figs, and very good: in respect of Zedekiah and the
other Jews that remained at Jerusalem, called naughty figs, for who^
greater punishment was reserved. Ier. 24, 1, 2, 3, 5, etc. Also Zedechiah is
Iechoniahs uncle, 2 Kin. 24, 17. and his son, 1 Chro. 3, 16. and his brother,
2 Chronicles. 36, 10. in diverse respects. The place of the holy city, is called
profane, Ezec. 48, 15. and 42, 20. yet the name of the city is, The Lord is
there, Ezech. 48, 35. and that place in other respect may be considered as a
part of the holy oblation, Ezec. 48, 8 -- 20. with 45, 1. etc. as Jerusalem
also is called the holy city, Neh. 11, 1, 8. Mat. 4, 5. and 27, 53. And the
faithful city becomes an harlot; and yet is still the daughter of Zion, the
house of Jacob, the Church and people of God. Esa. 1, 1, 21. with 10, 32. and
37, 22. Ier 2, 4, 13. and 5, 20, 21. Mic. 2, 5. and 3, 1, 9, 10. etc. And very
many such like every where in the Scripture may be observed.

And hitherto of Rom 11, 11, 20, 23, 25, 26. which he cites: and of ver. 27,
28, 29. the citation of which verses he omitteth: whereas they are specially to
be observed, for confirmation and assurance of the perpetuity and
unchaungeablenes of the Lords covenant made with the Fathers, Abraham, Isaac,
Jacob, and their seed for ever.

Romans 9.4
Like things may be observed out of the other Scriptures here cited by him: as
Romans 9, 4. with which he should have joined also ver. 5. where the Apostle
shows, that to the Jews apperteyne the adoption, covenants, promises, Esa.
59.20 21. (...)
Fathers, etc. And Esa. 59, 20, 21. where the Prophet teaches, that the Lords
covenant is with them, and their seed for ever. And Ezech. 34, 23 -- 30. where
the fruits of the Lords eternal covenant with his people are largely
described even (...) 2^, 25.
when he shall have punished them for their sins, and ^avenged the quarrel
of his covenant upon them: Where also is specially to be observed, how he is
still called the Lord then God, and they his people, ver. 30. which are the
words of the covenant. And where moreover we may learn to put difference
between this phrase, of the Lord being their God, and they his people (which
is so, even Psalm. 89, 30 -- 34. and 106, 43, 44, 45.
when and vvhiles the Lord does visit their iniquities with the rod) and
betvveen their knovving of the Lord their God to be with them, and they to be
his people, by the enjoying of his mercies and fruits of his favor, according
to his adoption and eternal covenant. ver. 30. and 31. Like as there is
difference, betvveene Ezec. 2, 3. and 33, 7. Zac. 1, 1. and 2, 3, 4.
a Prophets being among them, and between Eze. 2, 5. and 33, 33. Zach. 2, 9.11.
their knowing of this, that a Prophet has been among the^. Finally note here,
how this being the only place (of all those that he alleges together)
where the title of Gods people (whereof he speaks) is ascribed unto them:
the Prophet in this place, speaks not simply or only of their being Gods
people, but of their knowing (and finding by experience) that the Lord their
God is with them, and that they are his people. Which being well observed, as
I have shevved here before, is the more against this man himself.

Like as also is the next and last place, which he cites out of Hos. 3, 5.
Hos. 3, 5.
where it is expressly said, that when the children of Israel (being put out
of the land, and punished for their idolatry and other sins) shall have fit
many days without a king, etc. then afterward they shall return, and seek the
Lord their God (which are the words of the covenant) and David their king, and
shall fear the Lord, and his goodness in the latter days. By which it is
evident that there is (all that time) no default on the Lords part, but that it
is wholy of themselves, who in so long a time do not return and seek the
Lord their God, and Christ their king, nor fear the Lord, and come to his
goodness all this while.

And whereas he speaks of this people being called beloved, in respect of
their estate to come: he may see in the beginning of this chapter (but three or
four verses before that which he cites) that this term of beloved, yea beloved
of their friend and husband, was ascribed unto them by the Lord, when Hoseah
prophesied, notwithstanding their adulterous estate, being idolaters and
apostates. The words are these, (which upon like occasion have been treated
off before.) Then said the Lord unto me (says Hoseah,) Go yet, love a woman
(beloved of her Or, husband. as Ier. 3, 20.
friend, yet an adulteress) according to the love of the Lord toward the
children of Israel, who look to other Gods, and love flagons of wine. Hos. 3,
1. Which Scripture (being well considered, and compared with the other
Scriptures aforesaid) does so evidently convince this man's erroneous
assertions, and abuse of Scriptures: as it may suffice for answer and
refutation of all that he has throughout his treatise about the matters
aforesaid.

And hitherto of these objections concerning the circumcision and estate of
Israel. Some other things more of like sort does this man and others except
hereabout: which I need not now stand upon. By that which has been said the
discreet Reader will find how to answer any other objections which they bring
hereabout. And in the things aforesaid, I have written more largely then I
purposed: that so I might with one labor both more convince them, and better
inform the Reader concerning these things. Yet there being another objection
or two that are much urged about this matter: I will now also in particular
annex somewhat further thereabout: and then (God vvilling) proceed to other
matters, which are now likewise much called in question.

OBJECTION VI. But if Israel now were the church and people of God, then ought
none to have left them: it had been schism so to do. etc.
ANSWER.
1. Nay. the same Prophets that acknowledged them to be the people of the
Lord: yet taught all to leave and forsake their sinful estate and false
worship, whereinto they were fallen: being now become idolaters, apostates,
schismatics, that had divided themselves from Judah, etc. Hos. 4, 15, 16, 17.
and 5, 2, 3, 11. and 11, 12. Amos 4, 4, 5. and 5, 4, 5. with Mic. 1, 5, 13. and
2, 5. and 6, 16.

2. Even in Judah also it may be observed, that both in the time of Manasseh,
when he set up a graven image in the Temple of God, and caused Judah to sin
with his idols; as also in the days of Iehojakim: and long after in the time
of the Machabees, when Antiochus set up his idol and other profanations in
the Lords sanctuary: then the faithful and sincere worshippers of God,
refused to communicate with them in their idolatry, and chose rather to
suffer affliction, and death it self: so as Jerusalem was filled with
innocent blood. 2 King. 21, 1 -- 16. and 23, 36, 37. and 24, 3. 4. Dan. 11, 31,
32, 33. with 1 Machab. 1 chapter and 2 Match. 6, and 7 chapter and Heb. 11, 35, 36, 37,
38. Yet was Judah still acknowledged by the Prophets to be the church and
people of God: as has been showed here before, and may be seen throughout the
history and their Prophecies.

3. And when Esaias was enjoined by the Lord, (in Ahaz days) to bynd up the
Testimony, and scale the Law among his disciples: so keeping it from the
wicked and perverse, that stubburnely despised the word of God, and
communicating it only with the godly: Esa. 8, 16. with 7, 1. 2 Chronicles. 28,
chapt. yet even then also he acknowledges them to be the house of Jacob, from
whom the Lord hid his face: and the people of God, that should seek unto him,
and to his law and testimony. Esa. 8, 17, 19, 20. with 1, 3. and 3, 15. and
10, 2, 24.

4. The Prophet Amos also, (teaching the people to avoid al places and
assemblies of idolatry and false worship) did not only teach them not to
seek Bethel, nor to enter into Gilgal, (which were places in Israel) but
taught them also not to pass over to Beershebah; (which was 1 Kin. 19 3.
a city in Judah) Amo. 5, 5. Yet did he acknovvledge them to be the family of
Israel, which God brought out of Egypt; and the people of God; even Jacob, the
Lords covenanted people, etc. (as I have shevved more largely Page 62, 83.
here before) Amo. 3, 1, 2. and 5, 1. and 7, 2, 5, 15. So whether it be Judah
or Israel (and consequently other Churches, better or worse) they may be
acknowledged for the churches and people of God; and yet must be left, when
they stand in apostasy, schism, idolatry, etc. and not be communicated
vvithall in such sinful estate and transgression.

5. Here therefore is to be observed, that as they are the church and people of
God, none are to leave or refuse communion with them: but only as they stand
in apostasy, schism, false worship, etc. Neither Israel nor Judah might be
left, nor the Temple in Jerusalem, as they were the people and Temple of God,
but as Jeroboam caused Israel to sin, setting up the calves at Dan and
Bethell, etc. and as Manasseh polluted the house of God and caused Judah to
sin with his idols, and Antiochus profaned the Sanctuary, and compelled the
Jews to transgress the Law of God, etc. Yea even touching the Church of Rome
also in particular, we neither do nor may leave it, as it is the Temple and
church of God; but as Antichrist sits therein, opposing and exalting himself
above all that is called God or that is divine, polluting the Temple and
worship of God, etc. Romans 1, 7, etc. compared with 2 These. 2, 4. and Rev 11,
1, 2, 3. etc, Which being observed, we do and may (yea and ought to)
acknovvledge and reteyn any doctrine of truth and ordinances of God still had
among them: and yet are bound to leave their corrupt and sinful estate; and in
obedience to God, according to his word, to return to the ancient estate of
that and the other primitive churches, as they were planted by the Apostles in
the faith and order of Christ. Rev. 14, 9 -- 12. and 18, 4. and 22, 14. with
Jer. 6, 16. and 18, 15. Song. 1, 7, 8.

6. Moreover it is well known, that among such as do much urge this
objection, there are some who have left the French reformed Church in Amst.
for some things now had and continued in that church. Whereupon it will
necessarily follow, that either they hold a true church may be left, for some
things had among them, and yet be held to be the Church of God notwithstanding:
or else that they hold not the French church aforesaid to be the church of God,
in their estate. Let them now tell whether.

7. It is also Popish to hold, that the church cannot err; And Anabaptisticall
to think, that when a church so erreth as it falls into idolatry, apostasy,
or the like transgressions, then they cease to be the church and people of God
any longer; and very Popish again and in deed irreligious, under the title of
the church of God, to urge all either to walk as themselves do (what ever
transgressions they have against the word of God) or else to account the^
heretics, schismatics, seditious, singular, new fangled, that refuse so to
do, endeavoring to walk in the faith and order of Christ in all things,
according to the word of God.

8. Whereupon it comes to pass in this case, as heretofore it did, when that
was counted heresy in the Apostles and primitive Churches, which was not so in
deed. Act. 24, 5, 14. So now at this day both by Papists and others that is
often esteemed to be schism, which in deed is not so. True it is, that schism
is very carefully and religiously to be avoided, whether it be factious
division in the Church, or scandalous departing from it 1 Cor. 11, 18, 19. Romans
16, 17. Heb. 10, 25. Jude v. 11, and 16, and 19. God has set an order in his
church, and appointed bounds and limits, which none should transgress. Col, 2,
5. 1 Cor. 14, 33 -- 40. 1 These. 5, 14. Jude ver. 19. with Psalm. 17, 4. Schisms
and divisions, hatred and variance, emulations and wrath, strife and envyings
are among the works of the flesh: of which the Apostle teaches, that they
which do such things, shall not inherit the kingdom of God. 1 Cor. 3, 3, 4.
Gal. 5, 19, 20, 21. But on the other hand, sincere obedience unto God, and an
holy keeping of the faith, worship, and order, which he has once given unto
his church, is very carefully also to be retained, and religiously to be
performed: notwithstanding the prohibition or opposition of any Princes,
Prelates, people, churches, or other persons whosoever. For the Lord has
promised to show mercy to those that love him, and keep his commandments; and
threatened to visit the iniquity of such as hate him, and follow their own
inventions and misconceived courses, in his worship and service, etc. Exo. 20,
4, 5, 6. Lev. 10 chap. Numb. 16 chapter Esa. 29, 13, 14. and 65, 2 -- 7. Jer. 6, 14
-- 17. and 18, 15. Mat. 15, 7, 8, 9. and 28, 20. Col. 2, 5. 1 Timothy 6, 13, 14.
Jude v. 3 -- 23. Rev. 2, 10, 24, 25, 26. and 14, 12. and 22, 14, 18, 19.

But here it will be demanded, when and how we may know the estate of any
church or churches to be such, as we may leave it, or not. Touching which
question although I had rather hear and learn of others, then set down mine
own mind: specially considering what Opposites I have of sundry sorts, and
what great difficulties and weighty consequences, do follovv about this
matter every way: Yet being desirous that the truth and will of God herein,
may (what in us is) be found out and observed: I am not unwilling to note
down some fevv things, that I have observed from the word of God hereabout:
leaving them to be examined by the Scriptures, and both other things also to be
annexed, and these things withal to be further or otherwise observed, as
shall be found to be most according to God and godlynes.

And these they are: viz. That no churches of God are to be left, though having
or falling into errors and corruptions: 1. If their constitution be such, as
the Churches and Pastors thereof, stand (as touching their ecclesiastical
estate) immediately under Jesus Christ: as did each of the churches of Asia,
with the Angels thereof, and all the other Primitive Churches planted by the
Apostles, etc. Rev. 2, 1, 7, 12, 18. and 3, 1, 7, 14. Act. 14, 23. and 20, 17,
28. with the churches at Romans Cor. Gal. Ephesians. Phi. Col. These. etc.

2. If they also have and reteyne power within themselves, to redress any
error or corruption, and to receive any truth of God, as it shall be revealed
unto them, and they persuaded thereof, by the word of God. As may be seen also
in the Churches aforesaid.

3. And if the Ministers and other members of the church, be not urged in their
own persons, to any thing wherein they should sin and transgress the law
of God: but be left free for themselves and their own practice, to keep the
laws and ordinances of God, according to their places and occasions. As may
be seen in the church of the Jews (wherein were corruptions sundry times and
of sundry sorts:) where yet the Prophets, and other godly persons in diverse
ages, and Christ himself, and his disciples thus lived among the^. See 1 Kin.
14, 21-24. and 15, 1, 2, 3. etc. with 2 Chronicles. 12. and 13. and 14 chapter etc.

Judges, and of Rehoboam, Abiiah, etc. Also Esa. 1, 1. etc. Ier. 1, 1, 2, 3.

4. Lastly, if they do not obstinately refuse the truth and way God when it is
manifested unto them: perversely withstanding it themselves; speaking evil
thereof before others; reviling and persecuting such as teach or receive it,
etc. As may be seen in the said Church and Synagogues of the Jews, which
were not left, until they came to this untoward and perverse estate and
condition. For which see the history of the Evangelists, and Acts of the
Apostles: and particularly, Act. 2, 40. and 7, 51, 52. and 13, 14 -- 45 -- 51.
and 18, 6. and 19, 8, 9. and 28, 23 -- 28. 1 Timothy 6, 3, 4, 5. and 2 Timothy 3, 1
-- 5 -- 11. etc.

But if any churches fall into apostasy, and become so degenerate, as they and
their Pastors come to stand under an Antichristian hierarchy, or popular
anarchie: and reteyne not power within themselves, according to the word of
God to receive any truth showed unto them, and to redress any error or
corruption arising among them: but that the ministers and members are urged in
their own persons to such actions and duties as they cannot perform without
sin; neither can be suffered to keep whatsoever Christ has commanded them:
but must hold such a faith, perform such a worship, observe such an order, as
is prescribed or allowed by Princes, Prelates, people, etc. that now any who
know the truth and discern the corruptions of such churches, should still
remain Ministers or members thereof in such estate, and so live and dye: I
wish that such as are thus minded or inclining this way, would plainly set
down their opinions and reasons from the Word of God, concerning this matter.
Or if they like not of this manner of propounding of it, as here I have done:
that themselves would distinctly set down their own opinions hereabout,
alvvaies keeping to the points in controversy, and insisting upon the things
called in question: omitting to speak of such things, whether touching faith,
worship, or order, as are agreed upon on all hands. And thus much for the
present touching the Objection aforesaid: now I proceed to the next and last
concerning these matters.

OBIECT^ON VII.
But The Anabapt. The Charact of the bapt. p. 48. M. Ains. Animad p 98-76 98.
etc.
the Church of Rome (whereunto many things are applied, that are taken from
Israel) is not the Church of God, nor under the covenant of God; nor has any
of the Lords posts or ordinances left in it: but is divorced from the Lord:
etc. Neither is the church of England the Church of God, having his covenant,
but is likewise divorced from the Lord, etc. Therefore also the baptism had in
those Churches and the like, is not true baptism, but an idol, Iustif. p. 121
278. 461. and others.
a fiction, a lying and deceitful sign, a cursed and detestable sacrament.
etc.

ANSWER.
This objection is of much like sort with those which we had before touching
Israel, and the circumcision thereof: Whereunto therefore like answer may be
given in sundry respects: so as the former answers and reasons (many of them)
may hither likewise be referred. Neither the things only that are spoken of
Israel, but those also which concern Judah, in her apostasy and defection:
whereunto the estate of the Christian apostate church may fitly have reference,
in diverse respects. Which would be long to rehearse and insist upon in
particular. The indifferent Reader will carefully observe it. And the point it
self is plain enough and undeniable, by the reference which the Scripture in
sundry things makes thereunto. 2 These. 2, 4. 2 Pet. 2, 1. Rev. 11, 1 -- 6. and
12, 5, 6, 14. and 13, 5, 6. and 14, 1, 15. and 16, 12 -- 16. and 19, 1. etc.
Yet considering the objection here made, together with the continual urging
thereof; and how piteously the Anabaptists and others are by this means
overcaried with prejudice, and drawn from the way of truth to great error
and iniquity: I have thought it not amiss to note also somevvhat hereabout.

And first (to speak of the church of Rome in particular) I pray all to take
knowledge, that my mind and desire in my self is (and, I trust, shall be always)
to plead against the present estate of that church, and not for it:
acknovvledging it to be fallen into most sinful and deep defection and
apostasy; and so to be a notorious harlot and idolatresse: which all the
people of God ought to forsake, and to witness the truth thereagainst, even
unto death. Yet being also desirous (as I signified erewhile about an other
matter) that in all these things the truth may be found out, what we can; and
fynding that the Prophets which accounted Esa. 1, 21 Ier. 3, 3, 20 Eze. 16, 35
Hos. 2, 2, 5
Jerusalem and Israel to be harlots; and pronounced Esa. 57.3 4, 5. Ier. 2 and
7, and 44 chapter Hos. 2, 4. and 4, 12.
the children of Judah and Israel to be the sons of the sorceresse, the seed
of the adulterer, and whore, the children of transgression, a seed of
falsehood; inflaming themselves with idols under every green tree; slaying the
children in the valleys; going a whoring from under their God. Yea, Ezec. 23
2 -- 43. etc with 16, 2, 3 -- 44. etc
both of them (Aholah, and Aholibah, Israel and Judah) to be the daughters of
one mother; who committed whoredoms in Egypt in their youth, and afterward in
the land of Canaan grew old in adulteries; even such as should be judged by
Ezec. 16, 38.
the Lord, and and 23, 4^.
by righteous men, after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of
women that shed blood: because they were adulteresses, and blood was in their
hands, etc. did yet notwithstanding in other respects acknowledge them also to
be the people of God; the house of Jacob; the Lords vineyard; and heritage: the
dearly beloved of his soul; the virgin daughter of Zion; the children of
Israel beloved of the Lord, as a woman that is beloved of her husband, though
an adulteress; the congregation of the Lord; the house of Israel, etc. Esa.
1, 3. and 2, 6. and 3, 12. and 5, 1. and 48, 1. Jer. 2, 4, 11, 13. and 12, 7 --
10 Lam. 1, 15. and 2, 13. Ezech. 4, 5, 6. Hos. 3, 1. and 4, 1. and 5, 1. Amos
5, 1. and 7, 2, 8, 15. Mic. 2, 5. and 3, 1, 3, 5. and 6, 2, 3. These things (I
say) considered, I have thought it not amiss here also to observe somevvhat
touching the Apostate churches of Christians: and now more particularly
touching the church of Rome, by this occasion. And this the rather, that I may
stir up others (more able) seriously to consider of this matter, for the
further searching out and clearing of the truth therein; and because my self
have heretofore ben drawn to write somewhat of these things already. Which,
together with that I shall here annex, I do still leave to be examined by the
word of God. Neither will the searching of this matter prove unprofitable, if it
be done religiously, but will be of good and necessary use, both for the more
sound convincing of the Papists, and for preventing manifold errors and evils,
whereunto the Anabaptists and others are subject in this behalf. Now therefore
to proceed and come to the Objection aforesaid.

1. First, I take an argument from the Baptism had in the churches aforesaid
thus. The Baptism had in the church of Rome, I speak of the outward baptism
it self: not of the additions and corruptions thereabout
is the Lords baptism, the sign and seal of his covenant, the ordinance of
God, had in that Church from the Apostles times (before Antichrist there arose)
Romans 6, 2, 3. and so is true baptism, which is from heaven, and not of men;
that one Baptism, which perteyneth to the body of Christ, Ephesians. 4, 4, 5. which
the Lord has given to his church, and not man: whereof a number of Martyrs and
other Christians have been and yet are partakers; which such as leave
Antichrists corruptions, ought not to leave and renounce, but still to reteyne
it, as being the Lords; and such as wherevvith they may lavvfully come to the
Lords supper; whereas no unbaptized person may eat thereof: (As I have shevved
Pap. 27, and 34. etc
here before touching these particulars at large:) Therefore the Church of
Rome, is the Church of God, and under his covenant, and has some of the Lords
posts and ordinances yet remaining in it, though mixed with their own
inventions etc. And if the church of Rome be thus, then the church of England
much more; which is already much purged (by the mercy of God) from the
apostasy, iniquity, and abominations of the church of Rome. Otherwise also
what will become of these men themselves: who either have no other Baptism,
but that which they had in the churches aforesaid: or if they take another
unto themselves, run a whoring after their own inventions, without any
vvarrant of the word of God: as I have showed here before: page 27, etc.

2. If the churches of Rome and England be not under the covenant of God, but
divorced from the Lord, etc. then is there no salvation for any in those
churches. For out of the covenant of God there is no salvation. They which
have not God, to be their God in Jesus Christ, cannot be saved. And they which
are not under the covenant of God, have not God to be their God in Jesus
Christ. Esa. 43, 11. with Act. 4, 12. and Genesis 12, 3. and 17, 7. Act. 2, 38,
39. and 3, 25, 26. and 15, 11. and 16, 31. Joh. 14, 6. 2 Cor. 6, 14 -- 18. Romans
9, 24, 25, 26. and 11, 25, 26, 27. Gal. 3, 8, 15 -- 18, 26 -- 29. 1 Timothy 2, 5.
Now touching these churches themselves, great difference is to be observed. For
the church of England, the case is far more evident, and without al color of
question, seeing they do freely and fully acknowledge justification by faith
only in Jesus Christ, without any opinion of the merit of works, or
intercession of Saints departed, etc. For the church of Rome there is far
more difficulty: where both the merit of works, and intercession of Saints,
and the Popes pardons, and purgatory, with many other notable errors are
taught and defended. Yet considering that they profess and hold Rhemes
Annotat. upon 1 Timothy 2, 5.
Christ by nature to be truly both God and man, to be that one eternal Priest
and redeemer, which by his sacrifice and death upon the cross has reconciled
us to God, and paid his blood as a full and sufficient ransom for all our
sins, himself without need of any redemption, never subject to possibility of
sinning: again, to be the singular advocate and Patron of mankind, that by
himself alone and by his own merits procures all grace and mercy to mankind
in the fight of his Father, none making any intercession for him, nor giueing
any grace or force to his prayers, but he to al: none asking or obteyning
either grace in this life, or glory in the next, but by him: Considering (I
say) that thus they profess; although herevvith they have many great errors
and corruptions (as I noted before) by which they are generally seduced and
perverted: yet who dare say, but that God by this faith in Christ saves some
of them, who do thus believe in simplicity, and hear not of their other
opinions and courses to be errors and corruptions, nor resist the truth which
God vouchsafes to show unto them. And of this mind concerning them, I have been
a long time, and have by other occasion In the Answer to M. Jacob: p. 13, and
47. etc.
published it, almost twenty years since. And am the more confirmed in it,
inasmuch as some of them lay down their lives and dye Martyrs in defense of
the Christian faith (acknovvledging Jesus to be the Christ the son of God)
against the Turks and Moors and such like enemies of Christian religion:
besides that many of the Indians and other Pagans (with some Jews) are by
them converted and brought to the profession of Christian religion: among whom
I doubt not but the Lord has and saves his; even by that knowledge and faith
of Jesus Christ, which by their doctrine and preaching among them they are
(through the mercy of God) brought unto. Yea and who can say, but that
wheresoever the name of Christ is preached and called upon, the Lord saves
some, according to his own gracious purpose and mercy in Christ Jesus: seeing
that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life; and whosoever believes
in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life. Joh. 3, 16, 17. and 6, 35.
and 14, 6. Act. 8, 37. and 16, 30, 31. and 17, 2, 3, 4. and 18, 25 -- 28. and
28, 14, 23, 24. Romans 10, 9 -- 13. Here also to the same purpose might be
observed, that out of the Church there is no salvation: which I suppuse
themselves will not deny. And (that which is more) that the Lords constitutions
cease not to be his holy ordinances, though the people that enjoy them, should
have no benefit thereof to salvation, but use, or abuse them rather, to their
own greater condemnation. But omitting this, I proceed to other reasons, as
follovveth.

3 It has been the great question between the Jews and us, ever since the
Apostles times, and still is, whether Jesus be the Christ that was promised;
and whether the Jews, or Christians, now be the church of God. Now also
there are in the world the Christians, the Jews, the Turks, and Pagans. If
then the question be asked, which of these is the church of God at this day?
should we not answer, The Christians: and among the Christians also comprise
the churches aforesaid, for the reasons before specified.

4. Seeing baptism is among Christians a visible sign of the visible Church
of God, as circumcision was of old among the Jews: how can we soundly
defend and reteyn the visible baptism received in the church of Rome; and that
also with reference to the circumcision received in the apostasies of Judah
and Israel: if we do not accordingly acknovvledge the Church of Rome, to be
a visible church and the people of God, as Judah and Israel was in their
defection? (of which more in the next reason follovving.) A visible church, I
say: though miserably corrupted, adulterate, and apostate, having Antichrist
set therein: etc. Mat. 28, 18, 19. and Act. 2, 41, 47. with Genesis 17, 7 -- 12. 1
Cor. 1, 13, 16. and 10, 1, 2. Col. 2, 11, 12. and 2 These. 2, 3, 4. with Dan.
11, 31, 36. etc.

5. When Jerusalem, the faithful city, became an harlot; yet was it still the
city of God. Esa. 1, 21. Jer. 2, 3, 13, 20, 21, 27. Ezec. 16, 2 -- 35. etc.
with Jer. 25, 18, 29. Dan. 9, 18, 19. and with Deuteronomy. 28.10. When Judah fell
into idolatry, apostasy, and other notorious iniquity, yet was it Note the
times, and read the histories of the judges and Kings, of Rehoboam, Ahaz,
Manasseh, Iehojakim, Zedekiah, etc.
still the church and people of God; even when it had the transgressions and
idolatries of Israel; the abominations of the heathen; as many Gods, as she
had cities; the worship of Baal, and of all the host of heaven; building them
high places, images, and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree;
forsaking the Lord; and setting an image of jelousy (an idol of abomination)
in the house of God, where the Lord put his name; her children becoming the
sons of the sorceresse, the seed of the adulterer, and the whore, the
children of defection, a seed of falsehood; and she her self so abominable, as
she justified Samaria and Sodom through her impieties, etc. Iud. 2, 11, 12, 13,
19, 20. etc. 1 King. 14, 21 -- 24. 2 King. 16, 10 -- 16. and 21, 2 -- 9. and
23, 31 -- 37. and 24 chapter 2 Chronicles. 12, 1, 5. and 28 chapter and 33, 1 -- 10. and 36,
11 -- 16. with Esa. 1, 3, 4. and 57, 3, 4, 5. Ier. 2, 11, 13, 27, 28. and 7, 2,
9, 17, 18. and 12, 7 -- 10. and 24 chapter and 31, 21, 22. Ezec. 16. and 23 chapter
Dan. 8, 10, 11, 12. Mic. 1, 1, 5, 9, 13. and 2, 5. and 2, 1, 3, 5. and 6, 2, 3.
The like may be observed touching Israel in her apostasy and defection, as I
have shevved here p. 58, etc.
before at large. Therefore also the church of Rome, that was a faithful
church, and is become an harlot, being fallen into idolatry, apostasy, and
other notorious iniquity, as Jerusalem, Judah, and Israel heretofore; is in
like sort to be esteemed the church and people of God, that has thus offended,
and does thus transgress, as is aforesaid. The Proposition touching Judah, and
Jerusalem, I suppose these men will grant themselves. Yet for confirmation of
it both touching Judah and Israel, see the Scriptures alleged here and
before, besides many more throughout the history and Prophets, that might be
produced in this behalf. The consequence is proved, because these were figures
and types of the like cases and estate of the Christian churches, recorded for
our instruction and learning, 1 Cor. 10, 6 -- 11. with Romans 15, 4. and 2 Timothy
3, 16, 17. 2 Pet. 2, 1. Jude v. 5, 11. Rev. 2, 14, 20. and 11, 2. etc. And that
so, as the Scripture it self makes these to be the very patterns of the
Christians apostasy, and more particularly of the estate of the church of
Rome, in this behalf. For which see moreover, 2 These. 2, 3, 4. compared with 2
King. 21, 7. Esa. 14, 12, 13, 14. Ezec. 8, 3, 5. etc. Dan. 8, 10, 11, 12. and
11, 31, 36, 38. Also Rev. 11, 2, 5, 6, compared with the Scriptures aforesaid,
and with Esa. 1, 10, 11, 11, 21. Psalm. 59, 5. 1 King. 17, 1. and 2 King. 1, 10,
etc. Of which more hereafter.

6. And this is the more confirmed, inasmuch as it should be sin in the
church of Rome, for the Papists and apostate Christians, to join in marriage
with the Pagans; to neglect Baptism; not to sanctify the Lords day, etc. as
it was in Judah and Israel (being in apostasy) to join in marriage with the
heathen; to neglect circumcision; to profane the Lords Sabbaths, etc. Dan. 11,
32. with 1 Machab. 1, 16, 45, 51, 55. and with Mal. 2, 11. Ezra. 9, 1, 2. and
10, 10. Neh. 13, 3, 23 -- 27. Also Hos. 5, 7. and 7, 8. and 8, 12. Amo. 8, 5.
with 2 Cor. 6, 14. etc. Which should not so be, if they were not the people
and church of God, under his covenant, and bound to the observation of his
statutes and ordinances. For the Pagans and such as perteyne not to the
covenant of the Lord, being not his Church and people, are not in their estate
bound unto these and the like Ordinances of the Lord, which he has given to
his church and people. Psalm. 147, 19, 20. with Deuteronomy. 7, 1 -- 11.

7. The Apostle speaking of Antichrist in his Epistle to the Thessalonians
describes him thus: There shall come an apostasy (defection or falling away)
and the man of sin shall be revealed, 2 These. 2, 3, 4.
the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is
called God, or that is worshipped: so that he as God sits in the Temple of
God, showing himself that he is God. etc. 2 These. 2, 3, 4. Here the apostle
describing Antichrist, speaks of the Temple of God, where he sits etc.
Now that by the Temple of God in Israel, was figured the Church of God among
Christians, appears by these Scriptures. 1 Cor. 3, 16, 17. 2 Cor. 6, 16.
Ephesians. 2, 21. Rev. 11, 1, 2, 19. and 14, 15, 17. and 15, 5, 6, 8. and 16, 1,
17. compared with Zach. 6, 12, 13. and is acknowledged by the best writers of
all ages: who also thus interpret and apply this Scripture in 2 These. 2, 4. For
which see Amand. Polanus Symphonie, chap. 23, these. 3. and M. Clift. Advertis.
page 100 -- 113. So then from this Scripture, I reason as follows.

If the Pope of Rome with his hierarchy, be the man of sin (here spoken off)
and the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that
is called God, or that is worshipped; then is the church of Rome, the Temple of
God (here spoken off:) wherein he sits as God, showing himself that he is
God.

But the Pope of Rome with his hierarchy, is (by M. Ains. Animad. p. ^6 --
1^6.
their own grant) the man of sin, of whom the Apostle here speaks, etc.

Therefore the church of Rome, is the Temple of God also that here is spoken
off; etc.

Or thus, to like effect.

If the Church of Rome be not the Temple of God (and consequently, the church
of God) spoken off by the Apostle in this place, 2 These. 2, 4. then is not the
Pope with his hierarchy, the man of sin (that here is spoken off) and the
son of perdition, who opposes and exaleth himself above all that is called
God, or that is worshipped, so that he as God sits in the Temple of God,
shevving himself that he is God. 2 These. 2, 3, 4.

But the Pope with his hierarchy, is (by their own acknowledgement) the man
of sin, here spoken off: etc.

Therefore also the church of Rome is the Temple of God (and so, the Church of
God) spoken off in this place, 2 These. 2, 4.

The consequence is necessary: as appears by the express words of the text
it self, and the comparing of them with the Scriptures aforesaid. The reason
also is so evide^t, as whosoever hold not the church of Rome, to be the church
and Temple of God, here spoken of: neither can they hold, that the Pope of Rome
with his hierarchy, is the Antichrist and man of sin, set therein, as the
Apostle here speaks. And they that acknowledge this, must needs yield the
other withal.

Where (for further manifestation of the point) note and remember still, to put
difference betvveen the man of sin that sits, and the Temple of God,
wherein he sits. Which not being observed aright, (besides many unsound
speeches and assertions, that have passed such as are otherwise good writers)
much error has risen hereabout, and great confusion of things that differ. See
it for more evidence and confirmation hereof, in some other like matters and
phrases of Scripture, which may fitly be compared herevvith, and whereunto
this may well be referred, in diverse respects.

In the history of the Kings and Chronicles, it is recorded that Manasseh king
of Judah (who 2 King. 21, 9, 16.
made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the Lord,
and seduced them to do more evil then did the nations, whom the Lord
destroyed before the children of Israel) set a graven image of the grove that
he had made, in the house of which the Lord said to David and to Solomon his
son, In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes
of Israel, will I put my name for ever: 2 Kin. 21, 7. 2 Chro. 33, 7. etc. The
application hereof we shall show hereafter.

The Psalmist also speaking of the Chaldeans, says, O God, the heathen are
come into thine inheritance, thy holy Temple have they defiled: they have laid
Jerusalem on heaps. Psalm. 79, 1.

And Esaias speaking of the king of Babylon, says thus: How art thou fallen from
heaven, O or, Day star.
Lucifer, son of the morning? how art thou cut down to the ground, which
did weaken the nations? For thou have said in thine heart, I will exalt my
throne above the stars of God: and I will sit in the mount of or, testimony,
or, appointment.
the Congregation in the sides of the North: I will ascend above the heights of
the clouds, I will be like the most High. Esa. 14, 12, 13, 14. Now that by the
mount of or, Church.
the congregation at the sides of the North, is meant Mount Sion, on the north
side whereof (on mount Moriah) the Temple of Jerusalem was built, where also
by the Lords appointment, the people of God was wont to come together for the
worship of God: appears by this place, compared with Psalm. 48, 1, 2. and 78,
68. 2 King. 19, 21, 31. 2 Chronicles. 3, 1. Esa. 8, 18. and 10, 12. etc. And that
thus the Apostles speech aforesaid fitly agrees herewith, who can deny?

Ezechiell the Prophet (one of the captives in Chaldea) speaking of the Temple
of God at Jerusalem, and of the estate of the Jews (the Church and people of
God) in his time, says, The spirit lift me up between the earth and the
heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the
inner gate, that looks toward the North, where was the seat of the image of
jealousy, which provokes to jelousie. And behold, the glory of the God of
Israel was there, etc. Then said he unto me, Son of man, Lift up thine eyes
now the way toward the North: so I lift up mine eyes the way toward the North,
and behold Northward at the gate of the altar, the image of jealousy in the
entry. etc. Ezech. 8, 3, 4, 5. with 1, 1. etc. Where mark again, that
Northward at the gate of the altar (of the house and Temple of God) was the
seat of this image of Ielousy, or idol of indignation; another fit type of
Antichrist, and of his seat, in the church of God among Christians, or, the God
of strong might of forces, fortresses, munitions, the Almighty God, etc.
as this other was in the Temple of God among the Jews.

Daniel the Prophet speaking of Antiochus Epiphanes, and of his Captains and
Souldjours, and the Overseers which he set over Jerusalem and Judah; as also
of Jupiters image set in the house of God, etc. (other fit types of Antichrist
also) says thus, And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute or,
The Sanctuary (that is, the Temple of God) and the Munition (that is Jerusalem
being well described.)
the sanctuary of strength, and they shall take away the daily or, worship.
sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that makes desolate. etc. And
the king shall do according to his will, and he shall 2 These. 2, 4.
exalt himself, and magnify himself above every God, and shall speak
marveilous things against the God of Gods, and shall prosper til the
indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined, shall be done. Neither
shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any
God: but shall magnify himself above all. And as touching Dan. 7, 25. 2 Pet.
2, 18. Rev. 13, 5, 6, 11.
the God of strong forts, in his seat he shall honor, yea he shall honor
Jupiter Olympius. 2. Machab. C. 2. as Piscater and others expound ^t: applying
it a^^o to the breaden God, honored by the Pope with gold and silver.
a God whom his fathers know not, with gold, and with silver, and with
precious stones, and with pleasant things. etc. Dan. 11, 31, 36, 37, 38.

Wherewith also compare Dan. 7, 24, 25. and 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. and 12, 7, 11.
with 1 Machab. 1, 23, 39 -- 49.50 -- 53 -- 57 -- 62. etc. and 2 Machab. 5, 11
-- 22. etc. and 6, 1 -- 11. etc. 2 These. 2, 3, 4, 7 -- 12. 1 Timothy 4, 1, 2, 3. 2 Timothy 3 chap. 2 Pet. 2 chap. 1 John 2, 18, 19. Rev. 11, 2, 3. and 12, 1-6.7 --
14. etc. and 13, 5, 6, 7, 11. etc. And especially, this place, 2 These. 2, 3, 4.
Where the Apostles words (noted down here Page 124.
before) do so fitly agree with that speech of the Prophet Daniels, as they
may well be esteemed to have direct reference thereunto: the former being a fit
type of this other, in very many things of special weight and moment: and for
the point in hand very evident and plain, yea such, as by the reference
aforesaid do necessarily evince, that as the Sanctuary of Strength, (whereof
Daniel speaks) which was polluted by Antiochus and his instruments; and Gods
seat, wherein the idol was placed and honored; was the Temple of God at
Jerusalem, and so a true Temple; though lamentably profaned and defiled by the
means aforesaid: so also the Temple (whereof Paul speaks) wherein
Antichrist the Man of sin sits, is likewise the Temple of God; and so a
true Temple; though miserably polluted and profaned by Antichrists sitting, and
exalting himself therein, as the Apostle speaks. Where moreover we must still
remember, that the things which happened to the Jews for examples; were tipes
of things befalling the church under the Gospel, and are vvritte^ for our
admonition, upon who^ the ends of the world are come. 1 Cor. 10, 11. Romans 15,
4. Heb. 9, 1 -- 9 -- 24. etc. Ioh. 6, 32, 33. Jude v. 5 -- 23. Rev. 2, 14 --
20, etc.

So then here, and in the other places before alleged, see how plain and
needful it is, to distinguish between the carved image erected by Manasseh;
and the house of God wherein it was set. 2 King. 21, 7. 2 Chronicles. 33, 7.
betvveen the Chaldeans, and the holy Temple, etc. Psalm. 79, 1. between Lucifer,
the King of Babylon; and the Mount of the Congregation, Mount Sion, where he
said he would sit. Esa. 14, 12, 13. betvveen Baals Idol of jelousy or
indignation; and the Temple of God, in the entry whereof it was set. Ezech. 8,
3, 5. betvveen Antiochus, his Captains, Souldjours, Overseers, and Idols; and
the Sanctuary, Fortress, and seat of God, which they polluted and profaned,
in which and over which they were set, etc. Dan. 11, 31, 36, 37, 38. etc. And
so likewise between the Man of sin; and the Temple of God, wherein he
sits. 2 These. 2, 3, 4.

Note also herewithall, how fitly Judah in her apostasy and estate, yea the
case of Jerusalem and the Temple there, have typed out unto us the apostasy
and estate of the church of Rome. Which I note the rather, because that this
being observed, it will give great light for the right understanding of that
churches estate, and for the better deciding of many questions thereabout; and
does also plainly manifest the error of such as will not admit so much as to
have Israel in her apostasy made a type and pattern thereof, nor to have
reasons and answers deduced and applied from the one unto the other: whenas the
Scripture it self leads us even unto Judah, as a type and figure thereof, in
her apostasy and estate, and yet more particularly also to Jerusalem and the
Temple of God. As appears evidently and undeniably, by comparing together the
Apostles words, with the Prophet Daniels, 2 These. 2, 3, 4. with Dan. 11,
31.36, 37, ^8, etc. besides that which to the same purpose may likewise be
observed out of the other Scriptures here before mentioned, and all such like.

8. To which end, and for the question in hand, observe also that which John
has in the Revelation, when he says, Rev. 11.1, 2.
And there was given me a reed ^^ke unto a rod, and the Angel stood saying,
Rise, and measure the Temple of God, and ^he Altar, and them that worship
therein. But the Court which is without the Temple (...) leave out, and
measure it not: for it is given unto the Gentiles, Gr. cast out.
and the holy city shall ^hey tread upon, two and forty months. Rev. 11, 1,
2. For the better understanding of which Scripture, we are to remember, that
the Temple is diversely spoken of in the Scriptures: sometimes so, as it
compriseth the whole Temple, with all the parts thereof; sometimes but in
respect of some parts of it: and that also diversely. For the Scripture
shows, how there were diverse parts thereof: as namely, the holy place, Hebr.
9, 2, 6. Exodus 39, 1. and the most holy place, 1 King. 6, 16, 19. and 8, 6, 8.
Hebr. 9, 3, 7. and the courts, 1 King. 7, 12. and 2 King 21, 5. and 23, 12.
Psalm. 65, 4. and 84, 2. Ezech. 10, 3, 5. and 42, 3. Zach. 3, 7. both the
inward court of the Priests, which was next the holy place, and where the
Altar of burnt offering stood, Lev. 6, 16.26. 1 King. 6, 36. and 7, 12. 2 Chronicles.
4, 9. Ezech 10, 3. and 40, 19, 23, 27. and 43, 5. and 44, 17, 21, 27. and 45,
19. and the outward court for the people, which joined to the court of the
Priests, Ezec. 10, 5. and 40, 17, 20, 31. and 42, 1. and 44, 19. 1 Kin 7, 9. 2
Chro. 4, 9. and 23, 5. Esa. 1, 12. and 62, 9. Psa. 84, 2, 10. Jer. 19, 14. and
26, 2. Which outward Court is called the Temple, oftentimes by the Evangelists,
where there is mention of Christ's preaching, and the peoples being in the
Temple Luke 21, 37, 38. and 2, 27, 37. John 18, 20. Also Act. 2, 46. and 3, 1.
and 5, 20, 21. and of Christ's whipping of buyers and sellers out of the
Temple, Mat. 21, 12, 13. Joh. 2, 14 -- 17. and that none might carry a vessel
through the Temple, and other the like. Mar. 11, 15, 16, 17. Where also may be
noted, how Ariae Montan. Antiq. Iud^^. Ariel. lib. 5. page 92, 93.
some write, that (after Salomons first building of the Temple) the peoples
Court which at first was but one, being common both for men and women, came
in time to be severed with a partition into two: one for the men; and the
other for the women: Also, that without the courts aforesaid, there was an
other built, which they called CHOL, that is, profane: whereinto the
strangers of the Gentiles, that professed not the name of Israel, might come
for to pray; and the Jews also that were unclean, and not yet purged
according to the rite of the Sanctuary. Which Graser. Plaga Reg. in Apoc. 11.
some think is here to be observed, and to be applied hither for the better
understanding of this Scripture.

Now therefore as touching this Scripture ( Rev. 11, 1, 2.) whether we
understand it more generally, of the Christians and Christian Church, with
observation of differences among them: as by the measuring of some, and not
measuring of other parts thereof, may be considered: or whether yet more
specially, we apply the latter clause (of the Court and city) to the outvvard
visible estate of the church, and Christians, held by Antichristians: so making
application of this last estate to the church of Rome, and the Christians that
are likewise minded: every way it will follow that the estate of the said
Church and Christians, is to be looked upon and esteemed, according to the
estate of the Temple at Jerusalem, and particularly with reference to the
Court, and holy city given to So the Jews for their impiety ar^ called the
princes of Sodom, and people of Gomoriah Esa. 1, 2, 3, 4-10-12.
the Gentiles: and therefore is to be accounted the Church and city of God: as
the other were his court and city, though polluted, and defiled sundry ways,
yea so as the city that had been faithful, now became an harlot. Esa. 1, 2 -- 10
-- 12 -- 21. etc. Ezech. 16, 2 -- 35. etc. Dan. 11, 31. etc.

How (yet more particularly) to expound and apply, the Temple, the Altar, the
worshippers therein, the Court, the holy city, etc. would require a longer
discourse: and many have written well thereof in our own tongue, though
with some difference of interpretation and application thereof. So I shall
need to note the less thereabout. Thus much therefore only I do now observe
for the present occasion here. That first it be considered whether there be
here any mention of the most holy place (unles it be (as M. Bright man on Rev.
11, 1.
some think) included in the general of the Temple of God) or any reference
thereunto: because it was a type of heaven, as the Apostle plainly teaches,
Heb. 9, 24. whereas here is the description of the estate of Gods church and
people on earth.

Secondly, whether by the Temple of God, in this place, may not be understood
the holy place, and figuratively the faithful Christians and more inward
Church of God (so to speak) invisible to men, but seen and preserved by God,
that measured and sealed them for his: like as the holy place was not open to
the people; but was for the Priests alone that ministered there before the
Lord: And likewise by the altar, and the worshippers in it, to understand the
Altar and Priests that offered thereupon, and worshipped God in the Sanctuary
and holy place: figuratively noting the spiritual worship and mediation of
Christ, with the faithful Christians and worshippers (made Priests unto God)
who wholly and only rely upon Christ, and in his mediation alone present
themselves and their worship unto God: to whom now they are known, though
unto men unknovven or unregarded.

Thirdly, by the Court without the Temple, to understand the Court of the
people, called Ezec. 10, 5. 1 King 7, 9, 12. 2 Chro. 4, 9.
the outward court, the great Court, Ariae Montan. Antiq. Judaic. lib. 5, page
92.
the Court of Israel, noting in figure, the visible Church and Christians:
(though some Copies also here read it, the Court that is within the Temple,
which was the court of the Priests, exempting the court it self from the Altar
and worshippers in it, before spoken off, and Graser in Rev: 11, 2.
others take it of the outmost court of all, called CHOL, that is, profane,
vvhither both the heathen that came to pray, and the Jews that were unclean
might come, as is aforesaid: noting figuratively the visible estate of
Christians, corrupted sundry ways, and defiled:) And by the holy city, to
understand the city of Jerusalem, noting Ezec. 45, 1 -- 7. and 48, 8 -- 35.
in figure, either Psa. 122 2, 3, 4. Esa. 1, 21. and 48. 2. Ezec. 42, 20. Mat.
4, 5.
the visible church and outward estate of Christians more generally, or Esa. 1,
26 and 52, 1. and 60, 14 21, 22.
such as are truly godly, and in deed Gods holy Church more particularly.

Fourthly, by the Gentiles, to understand not heathens alone, as Antiochus,
etc. but the sinful and rebellious Jews, called the rulers of Sodom, and
people of Gomorrah, Esa. 1, 10. so figuratively noting profane and wicked
Christians, the Antichristian hierarchy, and Locusts, spoken off Rev. 9, 1 --
11. And by their having of the court given unto the^, and their treading of the
holy city two and forty months, to understand in one respect, their having
and possessing of the visible face of the Christian church, frequenting,
conversing and dominering therein, and in another respect, their afflicting of
Gods holy church and faithful ones, 1260 years; or the time appointed by God,
Rev. 11, 2, 3. Which M. Bright man on Rev. 11, 2, 3, etc.
some think, (taking it in the first sense or respect) did begin in
Constantines time, when the Church came to have a general peace, and freedom
from the persecutions whereunto it had been subject three hundred years before:
and did together with the peace, grow sundry ways far more cold and corrupt in
religion, the^ formerly had been.

Where furthermore and in the verses follovving (among other things) come these
particulars to be observed. 1. That the faithful Christians should be much
fewer, then the outvvard professing Christians, who grew now into apostasy
deeper and deeper; and so the inner church to be much lesser, then the outvvard
visible church of Christians: like as the holy place with the Altar, was far
lesser then the court and city; and the Priests that worshipped within, far
fewer then the people that resorted to the Court, and City without. To which
purpose also may be observed in the Prophet Esaias, how the Jews professing
religion, flocked by heaps to the house of God, bringing a multitude of
sacrifices to the Lord, frequenting his Courts and City continually: when as
now the daughter of Zion (the faithful church of the sealed and elect) was
left as a cottage in a vineyarde, as a lodge in a Cucumber garden, as a
besieged City: so as if the Lord of Hosts had not left them (a feed) a very
small remnant, they should have been as Sodom and Gomorrah, utterly cut off and
destroyed. Esa. 1, 2 -- 8 -- 12. etc.

II. That the foresaid sincere Christians were as it were hid (though known
approved and kept by the Lord) in respect of the outvvard professing
Christians, that were open and known abroad unto men: as the inward parts of
the Temple were more hid and secret, in respect of the outward Court and City,
that were patent to the view and access of al.

III. That some had entrance and access into the more inward church (so to
call it) through the way and estate of the outvvard and visible Church: though
Note this also for baptism the sacrament of entrance into the church, had in
times of apostasy.
now held and frequented by the Hierarchy and Christians in apostasy: like as
the entrance and passage into the more inward parts of the Temple, was through
the City and Court that was without, though now given to the Gentiles, the Jew
Princes and people of Sodom and Gomorrah, and by them trod upon, as is
aforesaid.

IIII. That as among the Jews, Psalm. 59, 3, 4, 5. and 54, 3, 5. with Esa. 1 2
-- 10. etc
such as were tretcherous, apostate, persecuting, strong and prevayling
outwardly, were of old called Gentiles or heathens: so now among the
Christians, such also as are tretcherous, apostate, persecuting, mighty, and
outwardly prevayling, are likewise here called heathens, or Gentiles.

V. That God in this estate stirred up among and against them, his witnesses,
few, yet sufficient, seeing they are two: and are also strengthened,
sanctified, directed, preserved, heard, and blessed of the Lord: as were Rev.
11, 4 with Zac. 3, and 4 chapter
Joshua and Zerubbabel, two Olive trees, and two candlesticks (in one respect)
Rev. 11.5 6. with Ex. 7, 19. etc. Numb. 16, 15, etc.
Moses and Aaron, 1 Kin. 17 1. and 18, and 19, 9 -- 17. and 21.17, 18 -- 24. 1
King 1, 10, 12, 17. and 2, 9, 23, 24. and 3. and 5, and 6, and 7, and 8, and 9,
and 13, 14 -- 21 Luke 4, 24, 25, 26, 27. Romans 11, 1 -- 5. Jam. 5, 17, 18.
Eliah and Elisha (in other respects) to whom here may reference be made: or
(as M. Forbis on Rev. 11, s. 3.
some think) also to the faithful witnesses of the truth that were among the
Jews, when Antiochus persecuted them, and profaned the Temple and worship of
God. Dan. 7, 8, 25, and 8, 9 -- 14. and 11, 31 -- 39. and 12, 7, 10. This also
is fitly applied to the old and New Testament. etc by M. Bright. Napeir, etc.


VI. That Rev. 11, 7 -- 12. with 14, 9 -- 12. and Col. 2, 5.
these vvitnesses being stayn by the beast (the Antichristian hierarchy and
Locusts aforesaid) and their corpse lying unburied in the street of the great
city Babylon, spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was
crucified, and thus beheld of the people and nations, to the great rejoicing of
them that dvvell on the earth: yet then afterward at the time appointed; they
stand upon their feet again, being revived by the power and spirit of God (as
Luke 1, 13 -- 17. with Mal. 4, 5. Matt. 11, 14. and 17, 10 -- 13.
John Baptist in spirit and power was Elias, and Ezec. 37. 1 -- 10.
the dead bones in Ezechiel were revived, and stood up on their feet again;
and as Genesis 4, 25
God gave Sheth to Eve, another seed in stead of Abell, whom Cain slew) and
so are called up into heaven, being now by the favor and power of God freed
from the earth of Antichrists apostasy, and separated from communion
therewith, to enjoy the heavenly estate and benefit of the faith and order of
Christ, wherein the churches at first were set by the Apostles.

VII. Where note, that by heaven (in this book of the Revelat.) is often meant
the more sincere, entire and heavenly estate of the church, for the faith,
worship, and order thereof; and by the Earth, the degenerate, corrupt, and
earthly estate thereof in apostasy: Also, that as by degrees the church did
degenerate, and not all at once; so also the restoration thereof, is not all
performed at once, but proceeds on by degrees: as we may observe a different
condition of these witnesses themselves, in their first testimony, and in
their revived estate: and afterward again (in the 14 chap. which may be a
further explication of this) the Angels, there spoken off, Rev. 14, 6, 8, 9. and
proceed still one of them further then another: and v. 9, etc.
the third calls more directly and earnestly for separation, and utter
leaving of the Beast, his worship and marks, then did the first and second; and
then afterward the other Angels there spoken of, are said to come one of them,
ver. 15.
out of the Temple; and another, ver. 17.
out of the Temple which is in heaven: the Scripture thus showing, how the
truth is manifested and proceeds on by degrees, and how the faithful are
brought by the Gospel from yielding homage unto the Hierarchy of Antichrist,
and grow up more and more to have the Temple in heaven, the Church in her
heavenly, open, and sincere estate, as it was before the earthly corruptions
and apostasy grew upon it.

VIII. That the event of things performed accordingly, may the more confirm
us, that live in this age, hereabout: inasmuch as now we know, that Guiliel. de
Sancto amo re. Marcilius Patuvius. Dantes. Fracisc. Petrarcha. Eckhardu^ John
Wicleff. etc.
the former Angels and vvitnesses of old (though godly men and Martyrs, yet)
continued themselves (many of them) in the apostate church of Rome, and other
churches, that were corrupted with the like apostasy: preaching the Gospel
unto and among them, calling them from idolatry, denouncing the fall of
Babylon, etc. whereas the Luther. Viret, Calvin, Latimer, etc.
latter Angels and vvitnesses that follovved after, called others, and were
called themselves, to separate from that estate, and to return to the ancient
faith and way, wherein the churches were set of old. Which also has been, and
yet is performed by degrees: As we find that Luther, Calvin, Latimer,
Bradford, and the godly with them, went further, then John Wickliff, John
Hus, Jerome of Prage, and others before them. Also that the Church of England
goes further in many things then the Lutherans. And that the other reformed
churches proceed further then the church of England: though yet all the
corruptions of the apostasy, be not wholy taken away, and the churches
brought to that heavenly synceritie, wherein they were planted by the Apostles
at the first: whereunto we ought all earnestly to strive, what in us is:
knovving that this estate is not atteyned all at once; and that those churches
which are most freed from the corruptions aforesaid, and come nearest to the
ancient integrity of the way of God, are the most partakers of this grace and
heavenly blessing of the Lord.

IX. That furthermore by the consideration of the Temple, with the several
parts, places and uses thereof, we may observe a double consideration of the
estate, and communion of the Church and people of God: The one here on earth,
the other in heaven. And that which is on earth, to be also two fould: the
one outward and visible, the other more invisible and inward. The outvvard and
visible, signified by the Court of the Temple, which was outward, vvhither all
Israel came, noting the churches outward estate and communion with God, in
the visible assemblies thereof. The inward and invisible, signified by the
sanctuary and holy place, which were inward, whither the Priests only had
access: noting the more invisible estate and communion which the elect and
faithful have with God in spirit and truth, being made Priests unto God in
Jesus Christ. And lastly, the estate and communion had with God in heaven,
signified by the most holy place, where God dwelt between the Cherubims, Hebr.
9, 7 -- 24.
whither only the high Priest came once a year, not without blood: Exo. 28.6
-- 29.
carrying on his breast and shoulders the names of the tribes of Israel graved
in precious stones, and so presented them before the Lord: noting Hebr. 3, 1.
and 9, 24. and 10 19, 20, 21. Ioh. 14, 2, 3.
our access to God in heaven, by Jesus Christ the high Priest of our
profession, who appears before God for us, and has many mansions prepared in
heaven for us, that where he is, there may we be also.

X. Finally, that as they which went into the inner parts of the Temple, did
pass (as I noted before) through the outvvard Court: and yet not all that come
to the outvvard Court, did or might pass to the places of the Temple that were
more inward: Sal. Song. 1, 7, 8. Act. 2, 47.
so they that would be partakers of Gods heavenly favors and blessings here
and for ever, should (what in them is) use the means and benefit of the
outvvard estate and communion of the Church of God on earth: and yet also not
all who enjoy the benefit of the churches visible estate, are partakers of the
invisible graces and eternal salvation of God: but only the elect and those
that are truly godly. Yea that the outvvard Court, and City to be trodden upon,
is subject to be given unto apostates and persecuters, and that for a long time
together: when yet all this time the elect and faithful passing through these
to within, being sanctified and approved of God, are still preserved, and
protected by him: and in the end, are called from earth up into heaven.

These now are the things which I thought here to note by this occasion.
Which are likewise (for the most of them) observed and acknowledged by the best
of the Protestant vvriters generally. Yea also some of these men themselves
(with whom we have to deal) do thus understand and apply that which is here
spoken of the Court and holy City, as in their own vvritings may be seen. And
because the point is of weight, for the matter in hand, I will here therefore
(before I proceed further) note down their own words; wishing the Reader
well to observe them: as follovveth.

When M. Sm. in a treatise of his, wrote thus, M. Sm. diffe. p. 20. and 21.
As the holy place with the Altar and Priests did properly signify the Church,
worship, and Saints, (Rev. 11, 1. 1 Pet. 2, 5.) under the new testament: so
the court without the holy place whither all the people came, and the typical
service performed there, did signify the confused assemblies of Antichristian
persecuters, and their ceremonial worship, Rev. 11, 2. which the spirit in
that place calls Gentiles or heathen in those respects: M. Ainsw. answering
him, after he had showed some misconceits of his about the Tabernacle and
things perteyning thereunto, proceeds then further in his answer on this
sort, saying: M. Ain. defense of Script. p. 12 13, 14, 15.
His eye sight failed not so much in the shadovv, as his heart was blinded in
the shadowed thing. For he makes [the tabernacle, altar, and Priests,] to
signify [the church, worship and Saints] under the new Testament: [the court
of the Tabernacle] he will have to signify the assemblies of Antichrist: [the
Israelites there assembling,] to signify the Antichristian persecurers: etc.
Behold unto what great iniquity he abuses the word of God. Note how M. A.
speaks of Israel here.
The body of the Church of Israel, Exo. 4, 22
the son and first borne of the Lord, Psalm. 135 4.
his chosen and chief treasure, Deu. 7, 6, 7.
precious unto him above all peoples of the earth, on whom he set his love,
Deu. 33.26.
riding upon the heavens for their help, and on the clouds in his glory, a
people verse. 29.
blessed and saved by the Lord, the shield of their help and sword of their
glory: this people he makes to signify the Antichristian persecuters, hated
of God, children of the Devil, for whose overthrow and confusion Christ Rev.
19, 11 -- 21.
rides on the heavens in his glory with a garment dipped in blood, and a sword
for to slay them, and fill all the fowls of the air with their flesh. etc.

The Lords Lev. 6, 16
holy Courts, wherein they that dwelt Psa. 65, 4
were blessed, for which the souls of the Saints Psalm. 84.2, 10.
longed and fainted, counting one day there better then a thousand othervvhere:
is now made to signify the Synagogue of Satan, and place where the Devil
dwells. etc

But what may we thin^ induced M. Sm. to this impiety? Even Satan deceived him
by one place of Scripture, which Page 21.
he cites in his book, viz, Rev. 11.2. where John was willed in a vision to
[cast out the Court which is without the temple, and not measure it, for it is
given to the Gentiles.] Hence does M. Sm. gather that the Israelites which
were wont to worship in the courts of the Lord did signify the Gentiles, that
is the Antichristians, and consequently the court must betoken Antichrists
church, and the worship Antichrists worship. Thus one dark Scripture is
alleged to overthrow the clear doctrine that shines throughout all the
Prophets. Yet even this place it self might have taught him better. For first
the commandment Rev. 11, 1.
to measure the Temple, Altar, and worshippers, signified the restoring or
repayring of Gods church and people, after some destruction and desolation: as
the like visions showed Ezec. 40, 3, 5. Zach. 2, 1, 2.
to Ezekiell and Zachary, after the destruction of Salomons temple, do
manifest.

Secondly, whenas [the Court and holy City] was not measured here by John, as
before by Ezec. 40, 47. and 48, 30. Zach. 2, 2.
the other Prophets they were, and as afterward Rev. 21, 15.
John did see: it may teach us that as yet there was not a full restoration of
Gods church and worship, from the defection of Antichrist.

Thirdly, in that the court is here said to be [ Rev. 11, 2
given to the Gentiles, and the holy city] should be trodden under foot of them,
and a time limited how long, [two and forty months,] this argues that the
court was not made, nor the city builded for them: but by Gods permission, for
^^e chastisement of men, was given unto them for a season, during which time
his [two witnesses] should prophecy against them. And thus it is said of the
figure, the first temple and city, Ier. 12, 7
I have giuen] the dearly beloved of my soul into the hands of her enemies. So
all Judah [ Jer. 20, 4
was giuen] into the hand of the king of Babell: and Esa. 63, 18.
Esaias complains how the adversaries had [troden downe] Gods sanctuary, as
here [ Rev. 11, 2.
they tread downe] the holy city. And if [the court of the Temple] must needs
signify Antichrists court, because it was given to the Gentiles, then must
[the holy city] by which name Neh. 11, 1. Esa. 48.2 and 52, 1. Matt. 4, 5.
Jerusalem is often called, signify also Antichrists city and church, because
it was trodden down of the same Gentiles: but all the Prophets show Psalm. 51,
18. and 87. and 122. Esa. 60. Rev. 21.
that it signified the Church of God. M. Ainsw. defense of Script. p. 12 -- 15.

Hitherto are M. Ainsworths words (when he wrote for the truth) against M.
Smith, whom he sharply blames for teaching that the Court without the Temple
did signify Antichrists Court or assemblies: and for that he would make the
Lords Courts to signify the Synagouue of Satan, and place where Satan
dwells, etc. whereas now himself writing another treatise since (against the
truth) takes up M. Sm. terms, and manner of exposition, to teach that the
Temple of God (spoken off by the Apostle, 2 These. 2, 4.) is Animad. p. 78, etc.
Antichrists Church; Note this well.
Antichrists Temple; Antichrists body; an idol like Antichrist himself; the
Synagogue of Satan; such as is no more the Temple of God, Ibid. pa. 94, etc.
then the devil, which appeared to the witch at Endor, was Samuel; such as the
type thereof should be set (not from the Temple of God at Jerusalem, but) from
Bells Temple in Babylon, or the Samaritanes Temple builded by Sanballat etc.
Would any think, that this were M. Ainsw. his writing or opinion, that had
written so earnestly and with so sharp reproofs against M. Smith before, if he
had not set his own name thereunto? Or may it not be thought, if M. Sm. were
alive, and savv this latter treatise of M. Ainsw. that he would now turn his
own speeches and reproofs upon himself, where he says, that his eye fight
failed him and his heart was blinded, that he abused the Scripture to great
impiety; that Satan deceived him; that the place it self might have taught
him better; etc. But of this, more hereafter.

Now for the present it shall suffice, touching the point in hand, to observe
how by M. Ainsw. his own grant, the Church of God is signified both by the
court of the Temple, though unmeasured, and given to the Gentiles; and by the
holy city, though trodden down also of the same Gentiles. Rev. 11, 2. And this
moreover to agree with the doctrine of all the Prophets. Now we know that the
Prophets and Apostles are not carried about with every vvynde: They are not as
reeds shaken hither and thither: but their doctrine is firm, and abides the
same for ever. So as if this was the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles,
when M. A. vvrote against M. Sm. (as here himself says:) then there is no
question but it is so still. And so let it still remain.

For the further declaration whereof, and better exposition of this Scripture,
let us also compare herevvith, that which is written in the Prophet Esaias,
where the Lord says, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have
rebelled against me. The ox knovveth his owner, and the ass his masters
cribibut Israel does not know, my people does not consider. Ah sinful
nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil doers, children that are
corrupters: they have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy one of
Israel to anger, they are gone away backwards, etc. Hear the word of the
Lord, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear unto the Law of our God, ye people of
Gomorrah. To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me, says
the Lord? When ye come Heb. to be seen.
to appear before me, who has required this at your hand, to tread my
Courts? How is the faithful city become an harlot? etc. Where observe first,
what a fit reference there is betvveen the perfidious Jews, here called the
rulers of Sodom and people of Gomorrah; and betvveen the insolent Christians,
called (in the Revelation) the Gentiles. Secondly, how the very like phrase of
treading the Courts of God, is used by the Prophet (as is in the other place by
the Apostle, of treading the holy city, Rev. 11, 2.) and may here signify
(besides a treading down or under foot) a frequent and continual conversing
in the outward and visible Church of God with their bodies, though their hearts
were far removed from God, and they served not the Lord syncerely according to
his word. Esa. 1, 12 -- 15. with 29, 13, 14. Thirdly, that the Princes and
people of Judah thus transgressing, and the faithful city (of Jerusalem)
becoming an harlot: yet they are still the people of God, and the Lord is
their God, and the Courts and city are the Lords. Other things that might here
be observed, I omit.

And for the term of the Gentiles used by the Apostle, that by it we may
understand, not the heathen, but Christians being apostates, wicked, and
mighty persecuters, outwardly prevayling etc. may appear (as I noted here
before) not only by the like speech of this Prophet, but of others also, where
the Israelites (circumcised, and members of the church of God, of the outward
visible Church of Israel) are likewise called heathens, in regard of their
perfidiousnes, iniquity, strength, persecution, prevailing outwardly, etc.
Psalm. 59, 5. compared with the title of the Psalm. Which is also observed by
M. Ains. in his Annot. both on Psalm. 59, 1, 6. and on Exodus 12, 43. though in
his opposition of us, he forget both it and himself. The like he observes also
upon the word M. Ain. annotat. on Psalm. 54, 2, 5. and 59, 1, 6. Exodus 12, 43.
strangers, which is applied by David to the Ziphims, who were of the tribe
of Judah, Psalm. 54, 3. and to Apostate Israelites, by the Chaldee Paraphrast,
as he notes on Exodus 12, 43. So as in this matter I need bring no other
testimony, but his own exposition of the Scripture othervvhere, when he
deals syncerely therein, without any perverting thereof, or shifting and
cavilling thereabout. But how ever he deal, it is evident and sufficient,
that the Jews who were the people of God, and so acknowledged by the
Prophets, are by them also termed the Princes of Sodom, and people of
Gomorrah, Esa. 1, 3, 10. and 3, 9, 12, 15. Jer. 23, 13, 14, 22, 27, 32. Ezec.
16, 3, 46 -- 56. with 13, 9, 10, 18, 19. etc. And many other the like in the
Scriptures: that we need not think it strange to have the terms of Gentiles,
of Sodom, and the like, applied to Christians likewise upon just occasions: as
in this place, Rev. 11, 2. etc. Herewith also we may compare Ezec. 34, 17, 18,
19. and that which is written in the prophecy of Daniel: how the little horn
(Antiochus, a type of Antichrist) waxed great toward the pleasant land (of
Judea) even to the host of heaven (the Church of God among the Jews) and cast
down some of the host, and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon
them; yea magnified himself even to the Prince of the host (the Lord God
himself) and that by him the daily sacrifice (figuring out Christ, and
justification by faith in him) was taken away, Antiochus also commanded the
Jews to sacrifice swines flesh and unclean beasts, and to eat also thereof,
etc 1 Match. 1, 47.48, and 2 Match. 6, 18. and 7, chapter A type of Antichrists
enjoining of will worship; teaching of Justification by works: walking in
unclean conversation, etc.
and the place of his Sanctuary cast down; and the host (of Gods people)
given over for the transgression against the daily sacrifice; and that he cast
down the truth (the doctrine of Gods Law touching his worship, and the
worship it self) to the ground; having both the Sanctuary, and the host given
to be trodden under foot, and polluted, for many days. Dan. 8, 9 -- 14. and 11,
31. etc. Where though the Sanctuary and host were thus given to be trodden
under foot and polluted, etc. yet were they still the Temple, church and people
of God notvvithstanding.

To conclude therefore, it may appear likewise Rev. 11, 2.
by this Scripture, (which speaks thus of the Court given unto the Gentiles,
etc.) how we may esteem of the church of Rome, and the like churches, to be in
the outvvard visible estate thereof, the Court now given to the Gentiles (to
the hierarchy of Antichrist, the wicked, profane, revolting, mighty, and
persecuting Christians,) Rev. 11, 2. and so likewise to be the Temple of God,
wherein the Man of sin sits as God, etc. 2 These 2, 3, 4. and consequently,
that fit reference may be made between the^ and the estate of the Church of
Judah in sundry respects: so as if Judah and the Sanctuary was then the Church
and Temple of God (which our opposites themselves will not deny) then the same
in like sort must needs be yielded also to the church of Rome, and other
churches in such estate.

9. Which is yet the more evident, if we observe that in the church of Rome,
there are the Lords posts and thresholds mixed with their own, as was in
Judah and Jerusalem of old. Ezec. 43, 7, 8, 9. Rev. 11, 2. and 2 These. 2, 4.
Which how ever some blush not to deny, yet even experience it self shows both
the thing it self to be true and undeniable, and such assertions to be
notoriously false, and extreemly injurious against the work of Gods grace and
power, who has preserved sundry trueths and ordinances of his among them,
albeit them selves have commingled therevvith their own notable errors and
superstitions. As namely, the doctrine of one God, and three persons; the
Father, Son, and holy Ghost; and of the Son of God made man, professing and
witnessing to death, that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God; the doctrine
also of the Creation of the world, made of nothing by the word of God; of the
Redemption of the world by Jesus Christ; of the Resurrection of the body, and
Immortality of the soul; together with the other grounds of Christian faith,
that are contained in the Articles, commonly called the Apostles Creed, the
Nicene Creed, Athanasius Creed, etc.

Also the Lords ordinance of Baptism: though commingled with their own
superstitions; as the doctrines aforesaid likewise be with sundry errors and
corruptions of their own. Besides that such as have and reteyne the Baptism
there had, may lavvfully and comfortably eat at the Lords table: Which
otherwise such could not do, seeing they that have not the Lords Baptism,
may not eat of the Lords Supper; but should profane it, if they do Mat. 28,
18, 19, 20. compared with Exodus 12, 43, 45, 48. and Mal. 1, 7, 8.

Moreover, the terms of the Temple of God, and of the Court of the Temple, are
by the Apostles ascribed to that, and the like Christian churches, and people.
2 These. 2, 4. Rev. 11, 2. And the people of God, which are called and come out
of Babylon, need not a new plantation of a church, but a reformation only. In
which respect, the term of the Reformed Churches, is very fit and godly, and
the proceeding accordingly: Whereas the course and dealing of the Anabaptists,
and all such, as either begin all a new, or aver such assertions as do
necessarily imply it, is not only preposterous, but excedingly sinful and
erroneous. Rev. 7, and 11, and 14, chapters, with 18, 4. and Esa. 48, 20. Ier.
50, 8. and 51, 45, 50. 2 Chronicles. 29, 5 -- 17. 2 These. 2, 4. 2 Pet. 2, 1, 2. etc.
and 3, 1, 2. etc. Jude. ver. 3, etc.

Finally, if the former assertions were true, and that there were not any of
Gods posts, thresholds, or ordinances at all left in that church: then would it
follovv on the one hand, that the apostasy of the man of sin were not a
mystery of iniquity (as the Apostle calls it) but that all might easily
discern and avoyde it: and on the other hand, that none of that church, since
the apostasy aforesaid, should be saved. Which apostasy, some begin two
hundred years after Christ, some three hundred years (in Constantines time)
some four, some five, some six hundred years after Christ: and the Apostle
Paul says, the mystery of that iniquity wrought already, in his days. 2
These, 2, 7. Whereupon, what consequences would follovv, if the assertions
aforesaid were true, such as are of heart and understanding will easily
perceive.

Difference therefore (as I have noted before) is to be observed and put
betvveen the church, and the apostasy thereof; betvveen the house of God, and
the pollutions thereof; between the Lords posts and thresholds, and man's
inventions and superstitions commingled therevvith; between the trueths and
ordinances of God that still are kept, and the errors and corruptions of men
that are brought in and retained vvithall; betvveen the Temple of God, and
Antichrists sitting therein; betvveen the Court and holy City, and the Gentiles
to whom they are given to tread upon, for the time appointed, etc. In regard
of which difference, diverse things are accordingly spoken, and different
phrases used in the Scriptures, and in the speeches and vvritings of men. Which
vvhiles many do not observe or regard, whereas they think to hold the truth
firmly, they run into error upon error extreemely.

10. Lastly, as in Israel and Judah, when they fell into apostasy, they ceased
not presently to be the church and people of God, neither did the Lord
forthwith cast them off and give them a bill of divorce, but did again and
again, time after time, plead with them, call them to repentance, and convince
them by his Prophets and servants, besides his avvakening of them by sundry
corrections and punishments: so should we likewise observe about the Church of
Rome, and the like: which have for a long time laid (as it were) lulled a
sleep in security: whom the Lord notwithstanding has by his witnesses and
servants from time to time, and of late (since Luthers time) more earnestly and
many ways set to avvaken, and to plead against them, calling them to
repentance, and convincing them daily more and more. Which work the Lord will
not slack, but will still follovv on and prosecute, till he have in all things
accomplished it, according to his own purpose, to the praise both of his
mercy and justice, in the end. In the mean time, vvhiles the Lord is pleading
with that church, discovering more and more the apostasy and iniquity thereof
by the light of his word, and testimony of his servants: we should not deny
it to be the church and Temple of God, though Antichrist sit therein, and
miserably pollute it: but because so it is, we should therefore the more
carefully set our selves to plead the Lords cause with it, against the
apostasy thereof, and in all things (what lies in us) to discover the
iniquity of the Man of sin, (the Beast, the Antichrist) that is set therein:
until the Lord have consumed that lawles one, and powered out the vial of his
wrath upon the Beasts throne, etc. fully performing his work upon the mystical
Babylon, as he has severely denounced, and expressly foretold, 2 These. 2, 3
-- 8. with Rev. 11, 2, 3. and 16, 10, 11. and 17, and 18 chap. etc. and as he
performed his work on the Chaldean Babylon heretofore. Jer. 50, and 51.

Where observe, that the Scripture in these places speaks not of Gods Temple,
Court, City or church to be destroyed; but of the Man of sin, to be the son
of perdition; of the lavvlesse one to be consumed and abolished, 2 These. 2, 3,
8. of the vial of Gods wrath to be powered on the Beasts throne, Rev. 16, 10.
of the Beast to go into perdition, Rev. 17, 11. of the great City Babylon, to
be burnt with fire, and to be thrown down, that she shall no more at all be
found; Rev. 18, 8, 20, 21. (with resemblance to the former Babylon of Chaldea,
Jer. 51, 61 -- 64.) Yea also that even at this time, and in this chapter,
where he speaks of the burning and utter destroying of Babylon, yet here now
Eusebius also writes that God called the people of the church of Jerusalem, out
from thence before the destruction of the cyty. Eccles. hist. l. 3 c. 5.
he calls his people out from thence: as he did before out of Babylon of old.
Rev. 18, 4. with Ier. 51, 45. Which shows that God yet still has his people
there: and that he puts difference between them, and the City of Babylon it
self.

Note here also, how some of this age (who have observed many worthy things out
of this book) think, that our days are but come to the time of the fourth
Angels pouring out of his vial upon the Son, etc. Rev. 16, 8, 9. And
touching the Beasts Throne it self, that the fifth Angels pouring out of his
vial thereon, is yet to come: understanding also thereby, the City of Rome,
that shall have Forwhich also note Rev. 18.8, 9, 15, 18, ^1. etc.
some sore outvvard calamity fall upon it, to the final destruction thereof,
etc. And then adds this moreover, saying: Let us observe from hence for our
learning, how long suffering and slow to anger God is; he has convinced this
whore of her foul and shameful tricks a thousand times before. But yet he vvil
not overthrow her utterly, before he have placed her sins in a more clear
Sunshine, then ever they saw yet. Which seeing it has been and shall also be
in vain, what remains, but her final doom of destruction to punish her
with, whenas she is past hope of any amendment. M. Brightman on Rev. 16, 8, 9,
10, etc. To which purpose may also be observed, that there it is said, they
repented not of their deeds: showing that by the vials and plagues there spoken
off, they should yet have been brought to repentance, which they were not.
Revel. 16, 10, 11.

Furthermore, all do acknowledge (as I noted before, upon like occasion) that
if any church have to deal with a particular person that has sinned, they
do and ought to hold him a member (though in sin) all the time that they are
pleading and dealing with him: until that obstinacy being joined to his other
sins, he be cast out and cut off from the church. How much more should this
be yielded to whole churches, all the time that the Lord is pleading with
them: as we see that Israel and Judah was dealt withal, by the Prophets
from time to time, yea and afterward by Christ himself and his Apostles.

Finally it were a very good thing (considering the manifold objections
hereabout) that these men would show the time, when the churches aforesaid
were by the Lord put from under his covenant, and had a bill of divorce given
unto them etc. Which how it is urged by the Papists themselves concerning the
church of Rome (and ought a thousand fold more to be urged in behalf of the
church of England) who can be ignorant? The Lord himself (who is the husband
and Lord of his church) has the power, and knows his own purpose, time and
means, for the disanulling of churches, removing of his Candlesticks, giving
his bill of divorce, etc. Which, when and as it pleases him to reveal it by
his word, is by all religiously to be regarded. Otherwise there are no men's
sayings (though never so peremptory) that can carry away such matters. It is
only the Word and work of God, that herein is to be observed and relied upon.
And thus much concerning these objections.

CHAPTER IIII. Replies and Answers concerning Churches in apostasy, and the
church of Rome, more particularly. etc.
Now moreover, seeing that by this occasion we treat both of this matter, and
of the Scriptures aforesaid: whereabout there has been and still is so very
great opposition made: it is needful, and (being thus provoked) I am not
unwilling, for the better fynding out and clearing of the truth in this
behalf, somevvhat more to insist hereupon. For although their errors and
evasions, abuse of Scriptures, and other absurdities, who deny or labor to
obscure these things (what they can) are so very many, as every page, yea
almost every sentence abounds therevvith; and withal so very shifting and
frivolous, as in them selves they are not worth the naming, much less vvorth
the refuting: yet considering that many in simplicity or otherwise (and some
not of the worst disposed) are greatly overcaried hereabout, whether by
prejudice of the matter it self, or by admiration of the men's persons that
oppose, or by some other sinister respect, themselves know best: I have
therefore thought it good here to give the Reader some taste of the Opposites
dealing in this behalf: that so they may set themselves more unpartially to
consider of these things, and more soundly to judge thereof, according to the
word of God.

Now then, whereas concerning this question, there had been speech and vvriting,
and my self (in answer thereof) had written thus In answer of M. A. letter, as
may be set in M. Ch^t. Advertis. p. 58, 59.
As touching the Church of Rome, there being speech about it to be the church
of God, I did allege the saying of the Apostle, that Antichrist should sit in
the Temple of God, as the Apostle expressly teaches, 2 These. 2, 4. And by the
Temple of God, understanding the church of God, it will follovv that Antichrist
should sit in the church of God: and is there to be sought and found: and not
among the Jews, Turks, Pagans or the like, as the Papists and others would
persuade us: neither that Antichrist takes away wholy the church of God, and
every truth and ordinance of the Lord, as Anabaptists, and such as are herein
Anabaptistically inclined would bear us in hand: Thereupon one of these
Opposites replying, first of all lays this for a ground, that M. Ain. A^mad.
p. 76.
the church of Rome is acknowledged by all that fear God to be the throne of
Antichrist. I answer, First, if it were so, that all would say this, as here
is set down: yet we would hear, Thus says the Lord. Secondly, although that
this being but generally spoken, and in a good understanding, might be
admitted: yet when men do so speak and understand it, as therevvithall to
imply or infer, that the church of Rome is not the Temple and church of God, we
must take heed how we admit it, considering what consequences follow
thereupon, for the upholding of Anabaptistrie and other erroneous opinions
thereabout: and seeing also the Scripture teaches that the Beasts throne in
deed is that, which was the Rev. 13, 2.
Dragons throne, and was by the Dragon given unto him (which this man himself
acknowledges Page 79.
here a little after, and applies unto Antichrist.) and is Rev. 17, 9, 10, 18.
that great city, which (in John's time reigned over the kings of the earth;
which is built on seven h^^; and had seven kings or kinds of regiment, whereof
fine were fallen, when John wrote, etc. which particulars, with other the
like, are al found to be thus in the city (not in the church) of Rome. Of
which point I shall have occasion to speak more hereafter. Besides that M.
Bright man on Rev. 13, 2. and 16, 10. and 17 chapter etc.
good writers also, and men fearing God, understand the Scriptures here
alleged, to speak of the city of Rome. Thirdly, it is also ^rue, that
Antichrist sits in the Temple of God, and so in the church of Rome, and
polluteth it, as Antiochus did Gods Temple at Jerusalem: Yet his sitting in
Gods Temple, makes not it to be his throne. 2 These. 2, 4. Lucifer (the king of
Babylon) boasted of his sitting in the mount of the Congregation, on the sides
of the North, meaning the Temple of God at Jerusalem. Yet Babylon was his
throne, and not the Temple on mount Sion. Esa. 14.12, 13. The Dragon is in
heaven, yet heaven is not his throne. Rev. 12, 3. In the days of Manasseh,
Zedechiah, Antiochus, and others, there were idols of sundry sorts set in the
Temple of God at Jerusalem: Yet was not Gods Sanctuary therefore the throne of
idols: but it was still Gods house, and Gods seat, though thus polluted: and
was so called and acknowledged by the Prophets notwithstanding. 2 King. 21, 7.
Ezec. 8, 3, 5. with ver. 14, and 16. Dan. 11, 31, 38. In deed the church of
Rome (properly taken) being in the city of Rome, men may mistake, or be
mistaken; and may the more be borne vvithall, and such speeches better be
admitted, when things are not yet called in question: and when men in
simplicity speak generally (as I said) and not by way of opposition, carping,
cavilling, reviling, oppugning, etc. as also if by such speeches men simply
mean, that Antichrist sits in the church of Rome, and yet deny it not
therefore to be the church and Temple of God notvvithstanding.

Another ground he would take from some words of mine, that I wrote
heretofore, viz. In answe^ to M. Jacob pref. sect. 6
that the hierarchy and church constitution of Antichrist is the most
detestable annarchie of Satan that ever was. And then also I wished the Reader
(as still I do) Ibid. sec^ 1.
to try what I write by the word of God: and as it agrees therevvith so to
receive it, and no further nor otherwise. So let this be my answer (once for
all) touching any thing objected that I have written about this, or any other
matter. Secondly, I do still profess, that the hierarchy of Antichrist, both
is of Satan, and is an apostasy most detestable. But this now further
vvithall, that popular anarchie also is most sinful and miserable. They are
both of them extreems, and religiously to be avoided. The middle way is the
right way, namely, Gods ordinance of the Eldership, which should carefully be
kept entire, against all usurpation both of the Prelacy of the one hand, and of
the people on the other. Thirdly, I do now observe (more, and in some things
otherwise then before) a difference between the churches constitution, and the
hierarchy of Antichrist, brought in upon it: also, betvveen Antichrist with
his hierarchy (whereabout our question is not) and the Temple or church of
God, wherein he sits: whereabout our question is; and whereunto this man
keeps not. Of which more hereafter: besides that which has been spoken
thereabout already. His reproachful speeches here and throughout his book, I
leave upon his own head. And now I come unto his answer, which next
follovveth.

Where first he answers, that in the former allegation of 2 These. 2, 4. and
the reason deduced from thence, truth and error are closely cowched together.
But he tells not what he acknowledges for truth, and what he takes to be
error. If so he had done, it may be he would have been found either to
acknowledge the truth, which now he sets himself to oppugn, or that his
own errors would the sooner and better have appeared, which he would now
covvch and carry away as closely as he can.

But for discerning hereof, he says, we are to consider, first how Antichrists
church is described in Gods word: secondly, what the state of the church of
Rome is at this day. And so proceeding in his description, he speaks of the
Church and Synagogue of Antichrist, of the Beast, of the great City, of the man
of sin, of the great whore, of Abaddon or Apollyon, the son of perdition,
etc. whereas he should treat of the Temple of God, whereof Paul speaks,
whose writings I suppose he will not deny to be Gods word. But thus it was
best for his plea, to keep (what he could) from the point of the question in
hand, and therefore also to confound things that differ, as he does throughout
his treatise. So all his plea is frivolous, and not to the purpose.

Likewise when M. Ain. Animad. p. 77.
he tells us of a Church, such as Bellarmine and others describe, one part
whereof lives on earth, an other under the earth, and a third part in heaven,
etc. whereas our question is of the Temple of God, whereof Paul speaks 2
These. 2, 4. and of the Court and holy City, whereof John speaks, Revel. 11,
2. which heretofore M. Ain. defense of Script. p. 12 13, 14, 15.
this man himself acknowledged and proved by the Scriptures to be the Church
of God. Yet the writings of Bellarmine and other Papists were extant then,
asvvell as now: and the now Romish religion (whereof he speaks) described
their church then, as now it does. But the case is altered with himself: vayn
shifts and pretenses are become his usual pleas in opposition of the truth,
and for the maintenance of his errors and evil dealing.

After these things premised, coming (as he says) to our arguments: he
speaks as follovveth. M. Ainsw. p. 77, 78.
Their first reason (says he) from 2 These. 2, 4. is unperfectly alleged, for
the text there says of the Man of sin, that he does sit as God in the Temple
of God: whereupon their conclusion must be, that Antichrist sits as God in
the Church of God. And if they can prove that he is the true God, I will yield
that his Temple is the true Temple, and his church the true church. Otherweise,
if he be but an Idol and not God: his Temple church and body, will prove but
an Idol like himself, and his blasphemy is worse then theirs which said,
Rev. 2, 9 and 3, 9.
they were Jews and were not, but did lie, and were the Synagogue of Satan.
These are M. Ainsw. words: and this answer he gives to that which I observed
out of 2 These. 2, 4. which I noted down Page 140.
here a little before. Now how full of shifts, errors, absurdities, abuse of
Scripture, and contradiction to himself this answer is, the text and matter it
self declares. Of which I will speak straight way. But first mark, and in
some respects marvel, how all these should proceed from this man, in this
matter, in one and so short a speech and passage: if it were not that God
would thus show his just work in him, for the more humbling of himself, and
warning of others by his example to take heed of such carriage and dealing, as
he is fallen into.

Now touching the matter in hand, although I could allege (which perhaps
himself would upon like occasion) that those words (as God) where about he
cavileth and uses his course of shifting, are not in the Claromontane Greek
copy of the Original, neither in the Syriack or old Latin Translations, Bez.
Annot. in 2 These. 2, 4
as M. Beza observes in his Annotations upon this place: yet vvil I not insist
thereupon, but keep unto the words, as they are in the Greek copies and
translations usually.

And first, let this be noted and remembered, that the question here treated
off, was, whether the church of Rome were the church of God, or no:
vvhereupon I alleged those words of the Apostle, where he says that
Antichrist should sit in the Temple of God, 2 These. 2, 4. and so insisted
thereon: And that the question was not, about the manner of Antichrists sitting
in the Temple of God, whether he should sit as God therein, or no. For that
was not the point in hand, nor is called in question between us. And therefore
I needed not now allege these words, or insist thereupon. And this is known
to be usual in all vvriters and disputers, sometimes not so much as to
mention, sometimes not to insist at all upon such words, whether of Scripture,
or of other vvriters, as perteyn not to the argument and matter in hand, or may
well be omitted in other respects. Which this man himself knovveth so well, as
I need not give him any instances thereof. Let his own vvritings and other
men's be observed hereabout. Or to let them alone, observe but these allegations
in the Scripture, with the particulars there mentioned and treated off, viz.
Heb. 12, 26. compared with Hag. 2, 6. Also Romans 10, 6, 7, 8. with Deuteronomy. 30, 11
-- 14. And Mat. 21, 8. with Zach. 9, 9. So all this answer is but a shift and
a mere cavil.

Secondly, for the question and point in hand, mark the words of the text, that
the Man of sin opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, etc.
so that he as God sits in the Temple of God etc. In the Temple of God, says
the text: it says not, As in the Temple of God: as this man's exception would
imply, with the inferences made thereupon. In deed the Apostle speaking of the
manner of Antichrists sitting, says, that he sits as God: but speaking of
the seat where he sits, he says expressly, in the Temple of God: and says
not, as in the Temple of God: as the answer here would import: which therefore
is merely shifting and full of deceit.

Thirdly, he does not only corrupt the text with evil gloses (one upon
another) but he does in deed abuse the Scripture and directly pervert it,
when for an inference he says, If they can prove that Antichrist is the true
God, etc. as if Paul's words were not plain to such as will understand, that
Antichrist exalts himself above all that is called God, so that he as God,
sits in the Temple of God, etc. and therefore is not the true God, but the
man of sin, and son of perdition, although that he as God sit in the Temple
of God, showing himself that he is God. 2 These. 2, 4.

Fourthly, difference is to be put (as I have noted here before) between the
man of sin that sits, and betvveen the Temple wherein he sits. The Man
of sin himself (says the Apostle) sits as God: yet the Temple wherein he
sits (says the same Apostle) is the Temple of God. And otherwise how is it
possible, if he were in deed true God sitting in the Temple of God, that he
should also be the Man of sin, and son of perdition, etc. But see the like
in the cases ( Page 125 126. etc.
before mentioned) that fell out at Jerusalem and the Temple there: when Baals
Idol of indignation was set at the entry of the house of God, Ezech. 8, 3, 5.
and when Antiochus Epiphanes and his Officers profaned the Sanctuary and city
of Jerusalem, and set the image of Jupiter Olympius in the Temple and seat of
God, Dan. 11, 31, 36. etc. who would not now put difference between the idols
and persons aforesaid, on the one hand; and betvveen the Temple and city of
God, wherein they were set, and which they polluted, on the other. And if
question should be made, whether the Temple and city so polluted, were yet
still notwithstanding the Temple and city of God: and one for proof thereof,
should allege the Scriptures aforesaid: would any Opposite now reasoning
thereabout, be so absurd and void of reason, as to make this or such like
inference thereupon, If they can prove that the idol of Baal or Jupiter, that
Antiochus or any of his Officers is the true God, then I will yield that Baals
Temple, Jupiters Temple, Antiochus and his Officers Temple, is the true Temple,
and their city the true city. Otherwise etc. Or who would not rather in the
fear of God reason thus: Although that Baal, Jupiter, Antiochus and his
Officers, be idols and vile persons, yea an abomination of desolation: yet the
Sanctuary and city of Jerusalem, wherein they were set, and which they
profaned, were still Gods Temple and holy city notvvithstanding.

Fifthly, observe here and throughout his treatise, how still he calls that
the Temple, Church and body of Antichrist, which Paul expressly and purposely
calls the Temple of God. And so therein note still his shifts, and his
errors, etc. When Antiochus had polluted the Temple of God at Jerusalem, and
had set the image of Jupiter Olympius therein, he sent then also an old man of
Athens to compel the Jews to call it the Temple of Jupiter Olympius. 2 Match.
6, 1, 2. Antichrist likewise (typed by Antiochus) has polluted the Temple of
God in the church of Rome, and other like churches, sitting therein as God and
showing himself to be God. 2 These. 2, 4. and now comes this man of himself,
and (like the old man of Athens) will needs call it, and persuade others to
esteem and call it, the Temple of Antichrist, the church of Antichrist, the
body of Antichrist, the Synagogue of Satan, etc.

Sixthly, he does not only pervert the Scripture, but also cross and
contradict it, vvhiles that which the Apostle says is the Temple of God, he
says it is an idol, like Antichrist himself.

Finally, how ever he would shift of, pervert, and obscure this Scripture,
and the matter in hand: yet the light of the truth so shines before his eyes,
as even here himself is forced to note and set it down, that upon the Apostles
words, who says, the man of sin sits as God in the Temple of God, our
conclusion must be, that Antichrist sits as God in the church of God. These
are his own words: and so in deed let this be our conclusion, that Antichrist
(as the Apostle says) is exalted above all that is called God, or that is
worshipped: so that he as God sits in the church of God. Now then this man
himself cannot deny, but the Apostles words will bear this inference: yea he
says, our conclusion must be thus hereupon. So notwithstanding all his
struggling and opposition here against, he is now driven (nill he, will he) to
give us the cause against himself: and to overthrow all his own writing
hereabout. Which being now done by himself: I may the better spare labor, in
manifesting the vanity and iniquity of his pretended exceptions. Only (because
the point is of weight, and of needful use against the Papists and
Anabaptists) I will here briefly note a fevv things more, which may give some
light for the present, and occasion of further search hereafter, about this
matter.

And first, seeing now themselves affirm, that our conclusion, upon the
Apostles words, must be this, that Antichrist as God sits in the church of
God: I ask, what church of God it is, whereof the Apostle says here, that
Antichrist as God sits therein. If they say, it is the church of Rome, they
give us the cause. If they say, it is not the church of Rome, but some other,
let them then show it. But in the whole process of this treatise of theirs,
they still speak of the church of Rome. And all the terms that here are used
by the Apostle, of the man of sin, the son of perdition, his opposition,
his exaltation, his sitting as God, his showing himself to be God, etc. they
apply to Antichrist the Pope of Rome and his hierarchy. But when they come to
this other clause of the Temple of God, to expound it of the Temple body and
Church of Antichrist, the Synagogue of Satan, the Temple of the devil, etc.
as they speak almost in every sentence of their treatise hereabout; and this
also in such sort, as they will not have it understood to be the church of
God; how strange is this? how far differing from their better and sounder
vvritings heretofore? If we should thus expound and apply the Scripture, what
outcryes should we hear, what reproach should we bear at their hands? When M.
Sm. (as we savv Page 133
erevvhile) applied the city and court without the Temple, (spoken off Rev. 11,
2.) to the confused assemblies of Antichrist, and Antichristian persecuters, M.
Ains. could not bear it, that the Court of the Temple should betoken
Antichrists church, etc. but did soundly convince and sharply rebuke him. Yet
now lo, himself in this treatise, will have the Temple of God, spoken off 2
These. 2, 4. not only to signify the church of Antichrist, the Synagogue of
Antichrist, the Temple, Church and body of Antichrist, etc. but cannot endure
that others should otherwise understand it, of the church of God: as by his
writing, reviling, and assertions may appear.

Here therefore for the better clearing and understanding of the matter, let me
ask moreover, whether these two propositio^s come to a like end, and agree the
one with the other, to note out the same thing, or not: viz. The man of sin
sits in the Temple of God. And, Antichrist sits or, in the Church of
Rome, and other like churches of Christians.
in the church of Rome.

If they be alike, and accord together in one, the cause will be plain. If
not, let them show the difference between these propositions, that so the
meaning of this Scripture may the better be found out.

And whereas also the term (sitting) notes authority, and continuance (as M.
Ains. Annot on Psalm. 1, 1. and 61, 8. and 102, 13. etc.
himself othervvhere well observes) let him tell us vvithal, whether
Antichrists authority and continuance, be in the church of Rome, or not:
according as the Apostle speaks here, of the Man of sin sitting in the Temple
of God. If he say, the authority and continuance of Antichrist, is in the
church of Rome, the case again will thus also be evident. If he say, it is not
there; let him then show us the Temple of God (spoken off by the Apostle)
where it is. Thus two lines, keeping directly to the point in question, will
more clear the matter, and better convince both Papist and Anabaptist; then
two thousand, full of shifts and errors, which do but the more harden both
of them against the truth, though several ways. But I will proceed.

Animad. p. 78.
The second thing, that here he insisteth upon, is the word Temple. But the
Apostles words are, the Temple of God: unto which he should have kept: as will
more appear afterward. In the mean time, observe how he which even now
said, our reason was unperfitly alleged, because of the omission of these
words (as God) which perteyning to another point then the question in hand,
might here therefore so be omitted: yet does now presently himself leave out
such words, which as touching the point in question may not be left out at
all. The particulars follovving vvil show it more plainly.

He says, we take it for granted, that by the Temple is meant the church: and
so go on in obscurity. Advert. p. 58, 59.
My words were these, speaking of the Apostles speech, where he says
Antichrist should sit in the Temple of God, 2 These. 2, 4. that here, by the
Temple of God understanding the church of God, it will follovv that Antichrist
should sit in the church of God: and is there to be sought and found, and not
among the Jews, Turks, Pagans, etc. Where first mark, that I spoke not of the
Temple only, but of the Temple of God, as the Apostle also does Secondly, I
do in deed here derive the reason from this exposition thereof, that by the
Temple of God is understood the church of God. Which, if it could be shevved
not to be agreeable to the Scriptures otherwhere, or that this place would not
bear it, I have done. But it is so evident, that 1 Cor. 3, 16, 17. 2 Cor. 6, 16.
the Scripture thus uses it, as even here, in the very next passage, this man
himself grants it. Neither does he show any one place of the Scripture,
where this phrase of the Temple of God used figuratively, as it is here, does
signify any other thing, then the church and people of God. And what should I
look for of an Opponent (that would deal soundly and syncerely) but that now
he should prove that it is not here meant of the Church of God: and should also
show whereof it is to be understood: and that by the word of God. Which till
he do, let the Reader observe his exceptions here, how idle they are, and to
no purpose for the matter in hand.

As first of all, when he says, that the Temple did primarily figure out
Christ, Joh. 2, 19, 21. and the Lord God almighty, and the Lamb is the Temple
in the heavenly Jerusalem Rev. 21, 22. To what purpose is this? will it
hereupon follow, that therefore by the Temple of God, 2 These. 2, 4. we may not
understant the Church of God? Or that they which do so, go on in obscurity?
But if in this sense (says he) we understand that speech of Paul touching
Antichrist, then must we translate the words (as August. de civ. Dei. l. 20,
c. 19.
some ancient Doctors have done) eis ton Naon, for the Temple, or, as if
himself were the Temple: etc. Where note first, how he speaks this with an
If: and secondly, that he tells not, whether himself do think, that it is
thus to be understood, or thus to be translated, or not. Which when he
resolves upon for himself, and so shows it, then may it more be considered
of. In the mean time, let the Reader observe, how himself goes on in
obscurity, what he can. And for the phrase it self, this only for the
present I will here note (and leave it to be observed and considered by the
Reader): that where Matthew has, eis to onoma tou patros, etc. into the name
of the Father etc. Mat. 28, 19. Luke has for it, epi to onomati Jesou
Christou, or, upon
in the name of Jesus Christ, Act. 2, 37. M. Brigh^ on Rev. 1^ 2.
and en to onomati tou Koriou, in the name of the Lord, Act. 10, 48. And a good
writer treating on Rev. 16, 2. on those words, eis tous anthropous, says They
upon vvho^ this ulcer (there spoken off) seizes, are men: there fell an ulcer
against men, as Beza turns it, or into men, as the vulgar reads, that is, on
men, as Antichrist is said to sit into the Temple, for in the Temple, 2 These.
2, 4. But the praeposition with an accusative case sounds, as if the sores
did vex not so much by sticking in the body, as by afflicting it from without;
which does more agree to these figurative sores, etc. And whether some such
thing likewise may not here be observed about this phrase, eis ton naon tou
Theou os Theon cathisai, to sit as God or, upon See Esa. 1^ 13.
into the Temple of God, where the same praeposition and case is used; or else
moreover to note out some very near, deep, close, or inward sitting of
Antichrist, into or in the Temple of God; I leave to be further considered:
desiring that the true meaning hereof (what can be) may be searched and found
out, for the better ending of these and sundry other questions, whereunto this
would give great light and help.

As for the Augustine.
ancient Doctor whom here he cites, let us hear himself speak. His words are
these, That which is Note these particulars
the temple of any idol or Devil, the Apostle would not call Notethes^
particulars
the Temple of God. Whereupon some will have in this place, not the Prince
himself, but after a manner his whole body, that is, the multitude of men
perteyning unto him together with himself under the Prince, understood to be
Antichrist. And more rightly they think it also to be said in Latin as in the
Greek: that he sits not in the Temple of God, but for the Temple of God,
which is the Notethes^ particulars
church. As we say he sits for a friend, that is, as a friend. August. de
civit. Dei, lib. 20. c. 19. Where note how far differing Augustine is from
this man that cites him. 1. Augustine speaks not only of the Temple, as he
does here, but of the Temple of God, keeping the Apostles words. 2. Augustine
says expressly, the Apostle would not call that the Temple of God, which were
the Temple of an idol or of the Devil; whereas this man every foot calls it
Animad^ p. 78 -- 82, 94, etc.
an idol like Antichrist himself, the church and Temple of Antichrist, the
Synagogue of Satan, such as the type thereof should be fetched (not from the
Temple of God at Jerusalem, but) from Jeroboams Temple, and Bells Temple in
Babylon, yea such as is no more the Temple of God, then the Devil which
appeared to the vvitch at Endor was Samuel, etc. Would the Apostles (think
we) or Augustine either call these or such like the Temple of God? 3. Nay,
Augustine (relating here the opinions of others about this, and the translation
vvithall) notes expressly and takes it for granted, that the Temple of God, is
the Church. Which this man oppugneth. 4. Or does Augustine expound it of Christ
himself, as here he applies it? Other particulars I insist not upon: of the
translation and interpretation I have spoken here before, leaving it so to be
considered of, as shall be found most agreeable to this and other Scriptures
compared together.

Now where he says, that Antichrist (the Pope) proclaims himself to be the
bridegroom of the church, which is the office of Christ; to be the Greatest
high-prist; to have power above all power, as well of heaven as of earth, etc.
these things plainly perteyne to those clauses of the Apostle, where he
describes Antichrist, with his hierarchy, to the man of sin, the son of
perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, etc.
and so touch not in deed the point of the controversy betvveen us; which is
not of Antichrist that sits, etc. but of the Temple of God, where he
sits. Only note this withal, that it is in some respect against himself,
and may also give some light to the question in hand, inasmuch as these things
(by his own grant here) are ascribed to Antichrist, and the Pope; by whom
there is no doubt, but he means the Pope of Rome. Whereupon it will follow,
that if there we find Antichrist the man of sin thus set, there also must be
sound the Temple of God wherein thus he sits.

Next he says, that secondarily the Temple figured the Church, but first the
catholic or universal Church, Ephesians. 2, 21. then every particular Church Note
this: for proportion kept with Israel: which when we speak of it, he
oppugneth. Animad. p. 15. etc.
by proportion, 1 Cor. 3, 16, 17. And both these are the church or Churches of
God, as appears by the Scriptures here cited by himself. Thus also it is
plainly manifest, that they who in this place apply it to the Church of God,
understand it not otherwise, then as himself graunts the type and figure may
lead unto. But yet of neither of the two, would he have it here to be
understood: and therefore brings exceptions concerning both. Which let the
Reader well observe and remember. And the rather, because that even here a
little after he says expressly, that Animad. page 80.
when the Apostle tells us, that Antichrist sits as God, in the Temple of
God, it is to be understood of their invading and destroying of Gods church and
people, as the heathens of old dealt with Jerusalem and dwellers therein. How
contradictorie these are the one unto the other, who can not discern? and
how now will he reconcile these two together, that by the Temple of God is
meant here, Gods Church invaded and destroyed by Antichrist: and yet that by
the Temple of God here, is not to be understood the church of God, neither
universal, nor particular?

But he says, we show not which of these two we intend. Neither does he
himself, when he says here presently after, that Antichrist invaded and
destroyed Gods church here meant by the Temple of God. Neither did he it
heretofore, when vvriting against M. Sm. he taught, that M. Ain. def. of Scri.
p. 14, 15.
by the court and holy city (spoken off Rev. 11, 2.) is signified the Church of
God. And if thus he could have rested, it had been somewhat. But now (to destroy
that which he built before) he sets himself to persuade, that it can neither
be understood of a particular Church, nor of the catholic or universal. So as
I might leave him to mainteyne or to reverse his own exposition hereof,
whether he thinks to be best and in the mean time to consider how all this
treatise, which he intended against us, falls upon his own head, and (if he
think there be any weight in it) is in deed against himself.

But because the point is of so great moment, although in respect of these
Opposites I need not, yet in other respects I am not unwilling to note
somevvhat more hereabout, leaving it still to mine own and others further
consideration, as shall be found most agreeable to the word of God, and to his
work, by the event of things already done and yet further to be accomplished.

By the Temple of God, properly taken, is usually meant the Temple that was at
Jerusalem. And this (we have heard) did primarily figure out Christ, and
secondarily the Church, both the catholic and universal, and particular
Churches likewise. Whereunto may be annexed also, that it figured 1 Cor. 6, 19.
with 2 Cor. 5, 1. and 6, 16. 1 Pet. 2, 5. and so may here also, in 2 These. 2,
4.
particular Christians, and (in several respects) both their bodies and their
souls and consciences. Moreover in that Temple at Jerusalem, there was the
Courts, the holy place, and the most holy place. Which sometimes all of them
together, sometimes some of them more particularly are called the Temple. And
so this word is diversely used and applied, as I have shevved Page 128.
before. Which therefore for the right understanding of the Scriptures, and
touching the question in hand, is carefully to be observed and remembered.

Now touching the Scripture and question spoken off: where the Apostle
speaks of the man of sin sitting in the Temple of God, Bellar. co^trov 3,
l. 3. c. 13, etc. Rhem, Test. in 2 These. 2, s 11.
Bellarmine and the Papists will not have it understood of the Church of God
among Chistians: and thus far M. Ains. and his followers agree with them in
this place. But Bellarmine expounds it literally of the Temple of Jerusalem; M.
A. expounds Animad. p. 78 -- 82. 93, 94. etc.
it straungly of the Synagogue of Satan, of the Temple of Antichrist and the
Devil, etc. And here now they differ one from another, and both of them from
the truth, as far as darkness does from light.

The Temple at Jerusalem was destroyed long since: and in the new Jerusalem
(which we expect clearly and shortly to come at the conversion of the Jews to
the Christian faith) there is no such Temple to be looked for: the sacrifices,
shadows, and ceremonies of the Law being now ceased. I saw no Temple therein
(says John) for the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb, are the Temple of it.
Rev. 21, 2, 22. So we may first cashier Bellarmines exposition: And then M.A.
which is (in some respects) a great deal more strange, that by the Temple of
God the Apostle should mean the Synagogue of Satan, the Temple of Antichrist
and the Devil, etc. Against which, if there were neither other Scripture,
nor any other thing at all, but that the Apostle here describes it by this
Name of the Temple of God, and calls Antichrists sitting therein as God, 2
These. 2, 7.
a mystery of iniquity, it were enough to teach us to advise well, and to
take far more heed thereabout. For is this term of the Temple of God, ever so
taken in the Scripture? Would the Apostle (says Augustine) call the Temple of
an idol or of the Devil, the Temple of God? Or when he describes the
mystery of Antichrists iniquity, would he teach the Church, that the place of
his sitting is the Temple of God, if he meant that it were in deed the
Synagogue of Satan and the Temple of Antichrist? For that Antichrist should
sit in the Temple of Antichrist; and Synagogue of Satan, what mystery is
there in it? All the world would easily perceive, that these agreed very well,
and most fitly together. But for Antichrist to sit in Gods Temple and Christ's
Church, this is in deed a mystery, and a mystery of iniquity: such as men had
need open the eyes of their understanding, and set their hearts religiously to
consider it, if they would discern it, as it is. Which may sufficiently
appear by these strange expositions, and like erroneous courses, found among
the Papists, Anabaptists, these men, and other such, whether Popishly or
Anabaptistically addicted hereabout.

And what may we think is it that induces the^ hereunto? Is it not first, that
this is a mystery of iniquity, which either is not readily perceived, or not
rightly esteemed, as it should? Is it not vvithall in the Papists, that they
would turn away the application of this Scripture from the Pope and church of
Rome: and therefore would send us to the Temple of Jerusalem, to find out this
mystery there? Is it not also (on another hand) in these men with the
Anabaptists and others like minded, that they cannot endure that the Church of
Rome should any way be esteemed the Church of God: and therefore will rather by
the Temple of God understand the Synagogue of Satan, and Temple of Antichrist,
then they vvil admit that the church of Rome, should be the Temple and church
of God.

For my self, my purpose is not to plead for the corrupt and adulterate estate
of the church of Rome, or of any degenerate churches at all: much less for any
impiety or iniquity of the Man of sin, of Antichrist or his hierarchy, of
the corruptions, false worship, or superstitions of that apostasy: against
which I have heretofore many years in prison, and now also (by the mercy of
God) this twenty years in exile witnessed, and still do witness the truth
of Christ, what in me is, and in that measure as it pleases him to manifest
and vouchsafe unto me. But my purpose is to show, that difference is to be put
betvveen the Temple of God, where Antichrist sits, and betvveen Antichrist
himself, who as God sits therein; that so the cause of the Protestants in
general, and ours in particular, may be kept sound and entire both against the
Papists and popish corruptions on the one hand, and against the Anabaptists and
Anabaptistical aberrations, on the other.

Now therefore to speak of the church of Rome in this respect, and how this
term is used: it is taken either particularly, or more generally. If we
understand it of a parttcular church (as the Apostle wrote Epist. to the Romans.
his Epistle to the church there:) how shall we soundly deny either it to be
the Temple of God, or Antichrist to be set therein? Even the Papists themselves
hold and tell us, that the Anton. Sum. part. 3. tit. 21. cap. 2. ^ 6.
Laterane Church in Rome, is the Parish Church of the Bishop of Rome. Which is
much to be observed about this question. And himself says here (as the truth
is) that the Tsmple figured every particular church: and therefore also the
particular Church of Rome. Which thing alone might suffice for the controversy
in hand. And that the more, because the Antichristian usurpation, opposition,
exaltation, extent of unlawful jurisdiction, and other such corruptions,
grown up since the first plantation of that church, are rather to be referred
to the Bishops of that church, then to that particular church it self: and do
more fitly and properly apperteyne to those clauses of the Apostles description
of Antichrist, where he calls him the man of sin, opposing and exalting
himself above all that is called God, or is reverend, sitting as God, and
showing himself that he is God, etc. then to this other clause of, the Temple
of God, whereabout our question is. Like as in the Revelation, they are to be
referred to the Beast, not to the church and people of God, in and over which
the beast tyrannizeth. Rev. 11, and 13, and 14, and 17, and 18 chapt.

If it be understood more generally, then may it be applied to all other such
Christian churches, as since the prevayling of Antichrist (the Pope of Rome)
are come under his jurisdiction and government, Rev. 11, 2.
and wherein he sits, or treads thereon, though not in his own person
in each of them, yet by his hierarchy, authority, usurpation, and
jurisdiction. And if we mark it also, we shall find that not the Pope only, but
the other hierarchicall Prelates, Diocesan, Provincial, and the like, have the
Parishes or particular churches perteyning to their jurisdictions, wherein
they sit, although not in their own persons, yet by their hierarchy and
authority. Yea even at Rome to this day, the Cardinals (that are next to the
Pope himself) are all of them Presbyters or Deacons, and have each of them
their particular church or parish, whereof they are named, and whereunto more
particularly they do apperteyne. Whereupon (to note it by the way) this may
also be observed, that if there be any Bishop at this day in our own country
or otherwhere, who has not his particular Church or parish, whereof he is
overseer, and whereunto he does properly appetteyne, all such are more
degenerate from the ancient way and order of the Primitive Churches, then is
the Pope himself, in this behalf. And, if the Bishops have still every one his
own peculiar parish and church to which they do properly belong, it is a
good print and footstep of the ancient way, wherein the churches were
planted at first by the Apostles and Evangelists: And is a point that will
give great light to this and other questions, now much controverted about the
order and government of the church.

Note here also, how the very things which the Prelates challenge in the
particular churches under them, are jurisdiction and ordination: And that
otherwise they leave the particular Parishes to their own peculiar Ministers,
for the ministration of the word and Sacraments among them ordinarily. Which is
observed in all churches and by all Prelates, even the most Popish, and under
the Pope himself, unto this day. And is a point also that will give light to
the better understanding of the estate of the Prelacy, and condition of the
Parishionall, Diocesan, Provincial, etc.
churches perteyning unto them, of what sort soever.

But to proceed: I am not ignorant that the terms of Diocesan, Provincial,
National, and Ecumenical or universal churches, are also otherwise used and
applied: and are ascribed to representative Churches, to Councils,
Convocations, Synodes, Courts, and the like: whereof there may be some use and
consideration not unprofitable about the matter here in hand, so it be not
otherwise abused. For who knows not that the Pope has now a long time sit
in Councils, Courts, and other Christian assemblies, opposing and exalting
himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, shevving himself
that he is God; establishing, confirming, and disanulling what he would,
ruling and overruling whom, when, and as he would: yet not present still in
his own person, but sometimes by his designed substitutes, alvvaies by his
usurped power, authority, and jurisdiction. But of this I will not insist.
It may suffice, for the point in hand, that Antichrist is so set and exalted as
has been said, in the Christian Churches aforesaid, which (I suppose) these men
themselves being better advised will not deny to be the Churches and Temple of
God. Or if they do, then I hope they will show of what other church or
churches they understand this Scripture, and how that which the Apostle
teaches in this place, is by the Man of sin performed in the Temple of God:
Alvvaies remembering to distinguish betvveen the man of sin himself, and
between the Temple of God wherein he sits, etc. And this for the present I
thought to note hereabout.

Animadv. p. 78.
Where he says, if we mean a particular Church, it will not agree with the
prophecies of Antichrist, whose City or church is so great, as peoples kinreds
toungues and nations do dwell in the streets thereof. Rev. 11, 8, 9. I answer
first, that still he calls that Antichrists church, which the Apostle calls the
Temple of God.

II. Secondly, how will he prove that the Beasts city (spoken off, Rev. 11,
8.) is the Temple of God, spoken of, 2 These. 2, 4. If he say, he speaks not of
the Temple of God, then he speaks not of the point in hand. If he speak of it,
why does he still call it the City, Church and Temple of Antichrist, and not
the Temple of God, as the Apostle terms it? Has the very phrase of the
Scripture so much light in it, as he can not endure to look upon it? Or does he
in these things, love darkness more then light? Or is there no difference to be
put between Antichrists City, and Gods church?

III. Thirdly, having this occasion, I will propound some things hereabout,
and leave them further to be considered off: being assured that if the true
meaning of these Scriptures be rightly found out, the difficulty about these
and sundry other matters will be far the more easy. Whereas therefore he does
not distinguish betvveen the City, and the Church, but here and throughout his
treatise usually confounds them as all one: let us observe and consider of
these things thereabout.

1. That this City (spoken off in Rev. 11, 8.
the place that he alleges) is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where
also our Lord was crucified. But the church is here called the Temple of God,
or the Court without the Temple, or the holy City, etc. For which see 2 These.
2, 4. and the chapter it self which here he cites, Revel. 11, 2.

2. That this great city is not only Sodom and Egypt spiritually, but is also
that Sodom and Egypt, where our Lord was crucified. Rev. 11, 8. Now al know,
that Christ our Lord was crucified in and under the jurisdiction of the City,
not of the Church of Rome. For he was condemned to death by Pontius Pilate the
Deputy of the Roman Emperor (under whose dominion and jurisdiction now the
Jews were) and was crucified by the Roman souldjours, being delivered to the
Gentiles (when yet there was no church at Rome:) as Christ himself had before
told his disciples. Mat. 27, 2, 11, 26, 27, 31, 35. with 20, 17, 18, 19. Luke
18, 31, 32, 33. and 23, 1, 2, etc. Joh. 18, 28, 31. and 19, 1, 2, 10, 12, 15,
16, 18, 23. etc. Which is also acknowledged by this man himself here a little
after. Animadv. page 83.

3. That this City is that, which was the Dragons throne, and was by the
Dragon given to the Beast. Rev. 13, 2. which this man himself also notes,
though to another purpose, Animad. page 79. But this was the City (not the
Church) of Rome. Neither, I think, will these men themselves say, that the
Church was the Dragons throne, or was by the Dragon given to the Beast.

4. That this City also is the throne of the Beast, and Babylon the great City,
spoken of Rev. 16, 10, 19. and 17, and 18 chapter Which, that it is to be
understood of the city of Rome, and the dominion thereof, will yet appear
further by the reasons follovving. And note here how M. Brighon Rev. 16.19.
some treating on Rev. 16, 19. expound great Babylon there, to be the city of
Constantinople, called New Rome. Which then makes the more for the point in
hand.

5. That this city is the woman that sits on seven mountains. Rev. 17, 9,
18. And that the City, (not the church) of Rome, is built on Called, Palatinus,
Capitolinus Qu^rinalis, Aventinus Caelius, Esquilinus, Viminalis.
seven mountains: As even Virgil. Geor. 2. Ovid. de Trist. l. 1. Ele. 4. and
l. 3. Eleg. 7. Propertius, etc.
the heathen Poets describe the situation thereof, before ever there was a
Christian church there.

6. That this City has seven kings, or kinds of government, whereof five were
fallen, when John wrote; one was then; and the other yet to come. Rev. 17, 9,
10. Which also is verified in the city of Rome: where the five several sorts
of government by Kings, Consuls, Dictators, Decemvirs, and Tribunes, were done
and ceased, before John's time: The sixth, by Emperors, was then when he lived
and wrote this: the other by Popes, was not yet come. But how should this be
found in the church of Rome: which was not before John's time: and therefore
could not have five kings, or kinds of government thereof then fallen, etc.

7. That this city, this Babylon, this woman, is that great city which reigned
over the kings of the earth, in John's time. Rev. 17, 18. And that not the
church, but the City of Rome so reigned, when John vvrote these things, all
do acknovvledge.

8. Finally, that the Lord himself puts difference between this City
Babylon, and his people therein: foretelling that this Babylon shall be utterly
burnt with fire, and thrown down with violence, so as it shall no more at
all be found: Rev. 18, 2, 8, 9, 18, 20, 21. etc. and yet then calling his
people out of her, Rev. 18, 4. Like as of old came to pass in the type hereof:
in Babylon of Chaldea: both for the wondrous desolation thereof; and for the
calling of the Lords people out from thence. Jer. 50. and 51, 1 -- 60, 61 --
64. with 50, 8, and 51, 6, 45. Esa. 48, 20. Zach. 2, 6, 7.

Other more reasons hereabout might be observed out of these and other Chapters
of this book of the Revelation, as also out of other Scriptures, and the event
of things, some whereof are since come to pass, and some remain yet to be
performed: But these may suffice to show how needful it is well to consider
what by the great city here spoken off, we are to understand; and heedfully to
distinguish between the church, and the city it self.

IIII, Fourthly, note here, that by the great city, is meant not only the city
it self, but the whole Jurisdiction, authority, and dominion thereof, how far
soever extended. For (as M. Bright on Rev. 16 19.
one well writes) the City is not only the town or piece of ground contained
within compass of the walls thereof, together with the Citizens and
inhabitants, having order and government among themselves, according to the
Laws and privileges there had: but also the whole jurisdiction and
government of the City, in all places perteyning thereunto. Which being
observed, we may thereby perceive that the streets of this City reach far,
even to all places under the jurisdiction thereof: and comprehend sundry
peoples, and kinreds, and toungues, and nations: as here is said. Whereupon it
is fitly compared to the great city Babylon, whose dominion and extent of
government was exceeding large and great. Rev. 14, 8. and 16, 19. and 17, 5.
and 18, 2, 3, 4, 7 -- 21. compared with Esa. 13, 19. and 14, 6. and 47, 5. Jer.
50. and 51. Neither is it only compared to cities, but to Egypt also, that was
a country. Which comparisons, though they have other peculiar uses and
applications, yet may also be observed in this behalf. Rev. 11, 8. And the
more, seeing that the extent of this City is such, as reached even to
Jerusalem, where our Lord was crucified, as is noted also in this place. Rev.
11, 8.

Where yet observe further, that the Church of Rome being fallen into deep
apostasy, and having the man of sin sitting therein as God, who has that
city for his throne, etc. the things that are spoken of this city, are also
applied to the apostate estate of that church of Rome, and the other churches
that are under the jurisdictio^ of the Prelacy of that Sea, wheresoever, and of
whatsoever people, kindred, toungue, or nation they be. Which application
thereof I do also acknowledge, as it is observed by and according to the word
of God. Rev. 11, 8. with Esa. 1, 10. Jer. 23, 14. Ezech. 16, 2 -- 46. etc. and
Rev. 14, 8. and 17, and 18, etc. with Esa. 21, 9. and 48, 20. Jer. 50. and 51,
1 -- 45. etc. Ezech. 16, 2 -- 35, etc. and 23 chap. Zach. 2, 6, 7. But shall we
therefore conclude, that by the Temple of God (spoken off 2 These. 2, 4.) may
not be understood the Church of God. This is the point to be insisted upon: as
also, whether we can soundly, and by vvarrant of the Scriptures deny the Church
of Rome (though in defection) and other Churches in apostasy to be the
Churches of God; and not to be under his covenant; nor to have his signs and
seals thereof; nor any of his ordinances remaining among them: but that even
the Baptism there had is an idol, a fiction, a lying and deceitful sign, a
cursed and detestable Sacrament. Which has been and yet is a great occasion and
main ground of Anabaptistrie: besides that it hardneth the Papists and others
in their errors much the more, when the Churches themselves, and the
ordinances of God (though corrupted, yet) still continued unto and among them,
are not so acknowledged by us, as they ought to be: Neither so only, but are
either utterly denied and disanulled; or so spoken and accounted off, as does
in deed necessarily imply the denial and disanulling thereof. When the Temple
of God at Jerusalem was polluted and profaned, and that so exceeding sinfully,
as God gave it up with Jerusalem into the enemies hand, yet whenas then
Nebucadnezar burnt it, the Lord took upon him the vengeance of his Temple
with great severity: because though it was polluted, yet it was still the
Lords Temple: which he accordingly should have regarded. Jer. 50, 28, and 51,
11. Which should teach all to take heed, how we esteem and deal with the
churches of God, though sinfully polluted and profaned. If the Lord were so
careful of the figure: shall we think he will have no regard of the figured
thing: which this man himself here acknowledges every particular church to
be: and therefore also the church of Rome.

But now he says next, that to understand by the Temple of God a particular
Church, is not answerable to the Temple of God in Israel, which was not for
one Synagogue, but for Deuteronomy. 16, 16.
the whole nation of the Jews, and for 1 Kin. 8, 41, 42. Ioh. 12, 20. Act. 8,
27.
the Gentiles that came to the faith, through the world: How greatly forgets
he himself, and how presently, seeing that here but a line before he said, the
Temple figured not only the catholic or universal Church, Ephesians. 2, 21. but
also every particular church by proportion. 1 Cor. 3, 16, 17. And may we not
then apply it unto that, whereof it was a figure, and accordingly understand
it? Or may not we so understand and apply it, as the Apostle does: who (as
himself says here) applies it to a particular church: 1 Cor. 3, 16, 17. with
which place may be joined, 2 Cor. 6.16. though that may also be further
extended. Besides, was not the Temple in Israel, for any and every Synagogue,
family, and person among them? And may not we now accordingly apply it to the
Churches and Christians of the Gentiles? And that the more, seeing that then
also it was for them, coming to the faith of Israel, whether mo or fewer?
Or were not the Jews, distributed into several and particular Synagogues:
which being jointly considered, were and might be esteemed as one people? And
are not the Christians (even those among whom Antichrist has most prevayled)
distributed likewise into particular churches or parishes? Which if any would
(in some good respect) consider jointly as one people: who would strive about
it; so as it were not any way abused for maintenance of any error against the
truth or word of God? But of this I will not insist: neither allege other
things that here might be observed. That alone may suffice, which I noted here
before.

By reason whereof also I need not stand on that, which he speaks about the
catholic or universal church, seeing it is enough for the matter in hand, to
find it in the particular churches, so as is aforesaid. Yet some things by this
occasion may here be noted vvithall. As namely, that the Church of Christ is
sometimes accounted as one Sal. Song. 4, 12, 16. and 5, 1. and 6, 2, 11
garden, being considered jointly in one; sometimes as many or sundry Sal. Song
4, 15. and 6, 2. and 8, 13
gardens, in respect of the diverse particular congregations thereof. Each of
which particular ones, both is a garden it self, and is also a part of that one
or universal garden of the Lord. So as he which dwells, and the trees and
herbs which grow, in any one of these, may be said to dwell and grow not
only in that particular garden alone, but also in the general or universal
garden, as it compriseth all the particular gardens within it; they being al of
them parts of the general. Likewise the Church is sometimes resembled by
Exodus 25, 31. 2 Chr. 13, 11. Zac. 4, 2, 11.
one Candlestick, having one shank or shaft, out of which come diverse branches,
wherein are Exodus 25 37. with Rev. 1, 11, 12, 20. and 2, and 3 chapter
seven several lamps: so as the light which is set in any one of the lamps,
stands not only in that particular lamp, but in the general candlestick:
sometimes by 2 King. 7, 49. 2 Chronicles. 4, 7..
ten candlesticks, sometimes by Rev. 11, 4.
two, etc. so noting both one catholic Church in general, and diverse
particular Congregations in special: sometimes more, sometimes fewer; yet so as
they are always parts and members of the general or universal, whether they
be more in number and more flourishing, or fewer and more decaying.

Where note moreover, that the Candlesticks and Lamps were set in the Temple
of God: and that the church of Rome, was a golden Candlestick, as well as the
rest of the Primitive Churches: and that this man himself says definitely,
Animad. p. 103.
the true churches were many of them apostate, when John wrote, whom yet
notwithstanding the Scripture calls, and Christ acknowledges them to be Rev.
1, 11 12, 20. and 2, 1.
golden candlesticks. In any of which, if Antichrist the man of sin had sit,
as in the church of Rome, I suppose this man would not deny, but his fitting
then should have been in the Temple of God: whether it were considered as a
particular Lamp and Candlestick it self, M. Brig. on Rev. 11 4.
or as a branch also and part of the great and general Candlestick: which is
Rev. 1, 11 12, 20. and 2, 1.
observed (in the respects aforesaid) to be a type both of the Catholic
church, and of the particular Congregations thereof: like as here the Temple is
by this man himself acknowledged (and rightly) also to be a type of both.
Animad. page 78.

As for the catholic or universal Church, which the Pope claymeth for his
Temple, what is that to us, who speak of the Temple of God, spoken off by the
Apostle, 2 These. 2, 4. And whereas he would be taught how that vvhorish
company that worship the Beast and Dragon, can be the true catholic church and
spouse of Christ: although that which I have noted before, be sufficient for
the point in hand: neither mean I now to insist on other things: yet seeing
thus he speaks here, let him first remember how but a little before he told
us, Animad. p. 77.
the catholic church of the now Romish religion (as themselves describe it)
has one part thereof on earth, another under the earth, and a third part in
heaven: and now here himself speaks only of such as are on earth: and those
also such as worship the Dragon and the Beast, spoken off, Rev. 13, 4. whereas
the Catholic Church in deed conteyneth all the Churches and people of God, that
have been from the beginning of the world, (before ever there was a church, yea
or a city at Rome) and that shall be to the end of the world, in any and every
age thereof; and (in another respect) all and only the elect of God, both
Angels and men.

2. And let himself now tell us, whether he think there was no other church or
churches of Christians, catholic or particular, wherein Antichrist sat,
since the apostasy of the Man of sin, but such as worshipped the Dragon
which gave power unto the Beast, and the beast also himself withal? Rev. 13,
4. And who then were the Tabernacle, and those that dwelt in heaven, whom the
beast blasphemed, and the Saints with whom he made war, two and forty
months. Rev. 13, 5, 6, 7. and of what church, or churches they were;
considering also, that the apostasy began so soon, and spread so far, and
continued so long. 2 These. 2, 3 -- 7. with Rev. 11, 1, 2, etc.

3. Let him also remember how Jerusalem, came to be Ezec. 16, 2, 35, etc. and
23, 2 -- 43. etc
an harlot, old in adulteries, and the Jews, to be Esa. 1, 4, 5, etc.
a sinful nation, laden with iniquity, forsaking the Lord, and revolting more
and more; yea Esa. 57, 3 4, 5. etc.
sons of the so^ceresse, the seed of the adulterer, and the whore; Esa. 65, 2
3, etc.
a rebellious people, which walked in a way not good, after their own
thoughts; 2 Chronicles. 36, 14. etc.
transgressing after all the abominations of the heathen, and polluting the
house of the Lord, which he had hallowed in Jerusalem, etc. whenas yet they
were still notwithstanding the city, people, and temple of the Lord. Esa. 1,
3. and 3, 12. with Jer. 50, 28. and 51, 11, 35, 36, 45, 50, 51.

4. And as for the true catholic church and spouse of Christ, whereof he
speaks, besides that it conteyneth only the elect, and all of them in all
ages and places of the world (as is aforesaid) himself also knows that it is
a church invisible unto us; whereas our question is of the Temple of God,
wherein the Man of sin sits, and so of the visible Church polluted and
profaned by Antichrist, as the Temple of God at Jerusalem was of old both by
the Jews themselves, and by Antiochus, etc. 2 These. 2, 4. and Rev. 11, 2.
compared with 2 Chronicles. 36, 14. etc. and Dan. 8, 9 -- 14. and 11, 31. etc.

5. Lastly, observe here, how still he speaks and uses the term of
Antichrists Temple; whereas we speak of the Temple of God, whereof the
Apostle speaks 2 These. 2, 4. and so of the Lords Court and City, spoken of,
Rev. 11, 2. which how ever he cannot now admit to signify the church of God;
yet he has both taught it Def. of Script. p. 14. etc.
heretofore, so as he need not now be taught it again, if he will but peruse
what himself formerly vvrote about this matter; and here again he teaches it
Animad. p. 80.
in the very next page follovving, where he interprets the Temple of God ( 2
These. 2 4.
here spoken off) to be Gods church and people: thus still forgetting and
contradicting himself: of vvhethersoever he mean it, whether of the church
catholic, or particular. Let him choose which he will, to expound it of, and
apply it unto. And then let him tell us, whether it be no otherwise the
church of God, but as the Devil himself is an Angel of light: expounding his
own words as shall please him best.

In the next place, where he says, that Animad p. 79.
the very word Temple, leads us to understand Antichrists church to be but a
counterfeyt, etc. mark first, how he keeps not the words of the Text. The
Apostle says not only, the Temple, but the Temple of God. So his exception
and assertion here (keeping to the Apostles words, and the point in hand) is
this in deed, and thus to be propounded: that the very phrase of the Temple of
God, leads us to understand Antichrists church to be but a counterfeyt. Which
if so it were, then also when the Apostle says to the Church of Corinth, in
the Scripture that himself cited Animad. p. 78.
here but a little before, 1 Cor. 3, 16.
know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, his meaning should be according to
this gloss, know ye not that ye are a counterfeyt church? Again, ver. 17.
If any man defile the Temple of God, him shall God destroy: that is, according
to his collection here, If any man defile a counterfeyt church, him shall God
destroy. And again, 2 Cor. 6, 16.
What agreement has the Temple of God with idols? for ye are the Temple of the
living God: that is, according to this understanding here, What agreement has
a counterfeyt church with idols? for ye are a counterfeyt church, etc.

Or to keep to the word Temple alone, as himself here chooses to do, let him
remember, how he said here, in Animad. p. 78.
the next page before, that the Temple figured out Christ primarily. Like as
Christ speaking of his body said to the Jews, Destroy this Temple, and in
three days I will raise it up: speaking of the Temple of his body. Ioh. 2,
19, 21. Will this man therefore now thereupon gather, as here he does, that
the very word Temple, leads us to understand Christ's body to be but a
counterfeyt? So in deed Daenaeus in Augustine. de haeres.
the Marcionites, and other heretics of old held, that Christ was not truly
man, but had a feyned and fantastical body, which he brought from heaven, and
took not of the substance of the Virgin Marie: Wherefore also they put out of
the Gospels, the genealogy of Christ described by Matthew and Luke, etc. What
a strength now such collections as this man makes, gives to these heresies
(revived again by some Anabaptists) let the wise judge: and let the weak take
heed of such counterfeit gloses.

Moreover, in Animad. p. 80.
the very next page following, he tells us, that Antichrists sitting as God in
the Temple of God, spoken off, 2 These. 2, 4. is to be understood of his
invading and destroying Gods church and people, as the heathens of old dealt
with Jerusalem and the dvvellers therein. And now here he tells us, the word
Temple leads us to a counterfeyt. So as then by his doctrine either
Antichrist has invaded and destroyed but a counterfeyt: and therefore not the
church and people of God in deed: neither is his dealing like the heathens of
old, who invaded and destroyed Jerusalem (the Lords city) and the dvvellers
therein, in very deed: or else he does still contradict himself, as in deed he
does. By which also may appear, how notably this man himself plays the
counterfeyt: and so might be left, with all his counterfeyt gloses, till God
give him better grace: were it not that the truth and good of others also are
to be respected vvithall.

Where he says, the Temple and tabernacle in Israel was not the church and
congregation of Gods people properly. See what he says to M. Sm. hereabout.
Def. of Scrip. p. 5, 8, etc.
properly, but a sacramental sign of Gods dwelling with them, etc. What
then? were they therefore but counterfeyts, and not a Temple and Tabernacle in
deed and in truth? Or did they not in Gods ordinance figure out the church (as
himself affirmed here a little before) and so were the church figuratively? Or
does not the Apostle so understand and apply them, in the places before
mentioned? 1 Cor. 3, 16, 17. 2 Cor. 6, 16. Ephesians. 2, 21. Circumcision also, and
the Passover in Israel, were signs of Gods covenant, leading unto Christ:
were they therefore but counterfeyts; and not a cutting of the foreskin, and a
lamb in very deed? Or were they not Gods holy Sacraments, and fit antitypes of
ours, in deed and in truth? Thus by his doctrine, might all Gods ordinances
and types in Israel be esteemed but counterfeyts: and all the doctrines,
comforts, directions, that throughout the Scriptures (and in Annot. on Genesis
Exo. Psalm. etc.
his own Annotations) are derived from them, might be turned away, as being
taken but from counterfeyts. How this again may strengthen the Anabaptists in
their errors, who would not have us to reason from circumcision to baptism,
from Israel to the church now, etc. all of judgment will easily discern.

But now at length, after he has made a great flourish to show that the
Temple is a counterfeyt, and bestowed needles labor to note some several
things about the church of God, and the Beast (which in deed differ much the
one from the other) in the end, he says plainly, Animad. p. 79, 80.
and would bring it in as his conclusion, that when the Apostle tells us,
that Antichrist sits as God in the Temple of God, it is to be understood
first of their invading and destroying of Gods church and people, as the
heathens of old dealt with Jerusalem and the dvvellers therein; secondly, of
their own vain ostenstation, vvhiles they will have it called the Christian
catholic church, and the Pope the head of the same. That now at length, he
speaks thus plainly, it is well done; and is directly against himself,
though he thinks not so: but whereas he would infer this as a conclusion
upon the premises, if he do but offer to bring it into form of reasoning,
himself will soon perceive how far he comes short.

Yet now a little to insist upon this interpretation of his, as himself has
set it down: first he says, that when the Apostle tells us, that
Antichrist sits as God in the Temple of God, it is to be understood, of
their invading and destroying of Gods church and people, as the heathens of old
dealt with Jerusalem and the dvvellers therein. What have we here? Does
himself now by the Temple of God, spoken of 2 The. 2, 4. understand Gods church
and people, yea such as was answerable to Jerusalem and the dvvellers therein
of old? Why then has he so eagerly oppugned us hereabout? Why has he so much
Animad. p. 78, and 79.
here before pretended, that the temple of God where Antichrist sits, is
not the church of God, but an Idol, like Antichrist himself, the Temple church
and body of Antichrist, a counterfeyt, etc. And why does he Ibid. p. 82 --
93, 94. etc.
hereafter again pretend, that it is the Synagogue of Satan, that Ieroboams
Idol Temples, and Bells Temple in Babylon, were the figures of it, that is no
more the Temple of God, then the Devil which appeared to the witch at Endor,
was Samuel, etc. Does he not extreemly forget and contradict himself? Or has
he Ezec. 14, 3 -- 10.
an Idol (of mainteyning an error, and pleasing his followers thereby) set up
in his own heart: which whiles he would give homage unto, he is confounded in
him self by the just judgment of God: yea driven to give us the cause against
himself, nill he will he? For what can be more plain, then that by the Temple
of God 2 These. 2 4.
here, is to be understood Gods church and people?

Well then, seeing now he affirms, that it is to be understood of Gods church
and people, it remains that he consider with himself, whether it be the
catholic and universal church of God, or some particular church or churches,
that here is understood. Which he must the more carefully regard, because but
Page 78.
erewhile he said, the temple figured both the catholic church, and every
particular church also: and yet would then persuade, that here it could be
understood of neither. But now (no doubt) he will expound it of one or other,
seeing himself says, the Apostles meaning is, by the Temple of God here to
understand Gods church and people: and (that which is more) such as is
answerable to Jerusalem and the dwellers therein: I suppose, he would say, the
Temple in Jerusalem, unles, perhaps he have some special purpose or pretense
in speaking otherwise. As I doubt not but he has, when he says here that
Antichrists sitting as God in the Temple of God is to be understood of their
invading and destroying Gods church and people, etc. Of which I come now to
speak next.

And first I ask, where he can show in the Scriptures, that sitting is put
for inuading and destroying: and more particularly, that by sitting as God in
the Temple of God, is to be understood the invading and destroying of Gods
church and people?

Secondly, I wish him and all to observe, how othervvhere still he teaches,
according to the Scripture phrase, that by sitting is meant abiding,
continuing, dwelling; or companying, and having familiarity together; or
ruling, and reigning with continuance, etc. As may be seen in his Annotations
on Psalm. 1, 1. and 9, 5. and 61, 8. and 69, 13. and 99, 1. and 102, 13. and
110, 1. and 122, 5. and 141, 14, etc. From all which expositions, and the like,
how far now himself differs, let the wise judge.

Ibid.
Thirdly, here a little before, and afterward again, he would persuade that the
Temple of God where Antichrist sits as God, is an Idol like himself, the
Temple church and body of Antichrist, the Synagogue of Satan, a counterfeyt,
etc. If then by sitting in it as God, should be understood the invading and
destroying thereof: the meaning should be this, that Antichrist should invade
and destroy an Idol like himself, his own Temple church and body, the
Synagogue of Satan, a counterfeyt, etc. And were this then evil in him so to
do? For sure the Apostle speaks of his sinfulnes. Or think they, that
Antichrist has done, or will do thus?

Ibid.
Fourthly, he said also here before, that the Temple of God figured the church
catholic, and particular. If then by sitting in it as God, be understood the
invading and destroying of it: he must show which of them he means to be
invaded and destroyed by Antichrist, the one or both of them.

Fifthly, though it be true, that Antichrist invades Gods church and destroys
many of his people (as both experience, and the description of the Beast, and
of the man of sin, and the types thereof in Nebuchadnezar and Antiochus do
manifest) yet here (for the point in hand) must be found out whether by sitting
in the Temple of God, be understood the invading and destroying thereof. And
yet then also will follovv still, that by the Temple of God here, must be
understood Gods church and people, answerable to the Temple and to Jerusalem
and the dwellers therein: which is still against himself, as is noted before.

And note further, that not only Nebuchadnezar and Antiochus (spoken off in
the Scriptures here alleged) were types of Antichrist: but also Pharaoh,
Corah, Dathan, Abiram, Saul, Absalon, Jeroboam, Ahaz, Iehojakim, the
persecuting and apostate Priests, the false prophets, and diverse others, both
in Judah and Israel and othervvhere: some in one respect, some in another: And
that therefore to discern the estate and dealing of Antichrist, we should not
look alone at some one thing, type, or event; but at the many things, types,
and events, that the Scripture shows, and which time and experience has
now already manifested sundry ways, and will yet make more manifest
hereafter, concerning this matter. Otherwise, great difference might be
observed in the tipes and things spoken off in the Scriptures here alleged.
For Jeremy speaks of Nebuzaradan a chief captain under Nebuchadnezar the
king of Babylon, how he burnt the house of the Lord, and the houses of
Jerusalem, and brake down the walls thereof, etc. Jer. 52, 12, 13. etc. Lam.
2, 7, 9. To which time the 97 Psalm also here alleged may be referred.
Daniel speaks of Antiochus king of Syria, who magnified himself against God,
took away the daily sacrifice, cast away the place of Gods sanctuary, trod
it and the host of God under foot, and (as it is in another place of the same
prophecy) polluted the Sanctuary of strength, (or, the Sanctuary and
munition, meaning the Temple and city of Jerusalem) and placed the abomination
that makes desolate. So as though the Temple and City of Jerusalem now
remained, yet they were polluted, spoiled, cast away, and trod under foot.
Dan. 8, 11, 13. and 11, 36. with ver. 31. Besides, the Jews in the captivity
of Babylon, acknowledge that their sins deserved it, as the Prophets also for
their sins had denounced it, Dan. 9, 5 -- 14. Psalm. 79, 8, 9. with Jeremies
prophecy throughout. Whereas the Jews in the persecution of Antiochus, allege
their integrity and faithful constancy in the worship and service of God,
even unto death, Psalm. 44, 17 -- 22. Albeit that diverse also then either by the
persecution of Antiochus, or by his flatteries, or both, were corrupted and
dealt wickedly against the covenant of the Lord. Dan. 11, 32, 33, 34, 35.
Wherein likewise there was a fit type both of Antichrists dealing, and of the
churches estate, in this behalf. And in all these times, the Jews
notvvithstanding, were the church and people of God; and though some of them
were slain and destroyed, yet among them still God preserved his Church and
people from the destruction intended by their adversaries: Both which as
touching the question and Scripture in hand, should carefully be observed.

Finally, this Scripture is so to be understood, as it may not contradict but
agree with that which is written, Rev. 11, 2, 3. where the Court of the Temple
is given to the Gentiles, and the holy City trod upon, two and forty months;
(whether this be understood Rese^bling the times of Eliah, of Antiochus of
Christ among the Pharisees, etc.
of shorter or longer times, which yet should have an end, or (with ver. 3. of
1260 years, putting a day for a year. And afterward the Temple of God is
opened in heaven, and therein is seen the Ark of his Testament, or covenant,
etc. Rev. 11, 19. and 14, 15, 17. and 15, 5, 6, 8. and 16, 1. And God has his
people still in Babylon. Rev. 18, 4. So Gods church and people then remain
still undestroyed, notvvithstanding all the opposition and exaltation of the
Man of sin, with all his tyranny, cruelty, and persecution, had in over and
against the church and people of God, from time to time, until himself (being
the son of perdition) come to be consumed and destroyed in the end.

Otherwise also the Anabaptists plea should here again be strengthened, who
hold M.S. charact. of the Beast. p. 56 etc.
that Antichrist has utterly destroyed the true Temple, the true church; and
has abolished the true baptism of Christ: and that therefore they must rear
up a new church, and get themselves a new baptism, etc. And so they proceed
from one error and evil to another. Wherein this man's erroneous opinions and
corrupt gloses may harden them much the more. And hitherto of the first
exposition of the words aforesaid, that here is given.

His other exposition is, that when the Apostle says, Antichrist sits as
God in the Temple of God, it is to be understood of their own vain
ostentation, vvhiles they will have Does he mean the church of Rome? or what
else speaks he off.
it (what I pray you) called the Christian catholic church, and the Pope the
head of the same. First I ask, whereof he speaks this, that they will have
it so called.? If of the Temple of God, himself in his very last words, told
us, that by it is understood Gods church and people in deed. If he speak of
some other thing, he speaks not to the point in hand. And besides what is
it, that he speaks off? And why does he not name it? Is it because if so he
did, his exposition would be found either contradictorie to the former, or
some other way to no purpose at all, but against himself?

Secondly, if the Apostle had meant that it was not the temple of God in deed,
but only that they would have it so called: could he not so have expressed his
mind for this clause of the Temple of God, as he does in the next words
touching Antichrist himself, when he says, he shows himself or pretends
that he is God: and as the Scripture speaks othervvhere, when it notes the
blasphemy of them, which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the
Synagogue of Satan, and so do lie. Rev. 2, 9. and 3, 9.

Thirdly, if it be thus to be understood, as now he says, that it is not the
Temple of God in deed, but only that they will have it so called in vain
ostentation, making the Pope the head thereof: then (besides his strengthening
again of the Anabaptists opinion aforesaid) his own former exposition here
given, can not stand, where he said (in the last words before) that it is to
be understood of Gods church and people invaded and destroyed by Antichrist, as
Jerusalem and the dvvellers therein were dealt with by the heathens of old.
For these were in deed the church and people of God (though sinfully corrupted)
and not only in their own vain ostentation, that they would be so called.

Lastly, many often boast vainly of that, which notvvithstanding they have or
may have in deed, but yet abuse it or walk not worthy thereof: as I shevved
Page 106. 107.
heretofore, by the example of the Jews here spoken off, out of Esa. 48, 1,
2. Zeph. 3, 11. Matthew. 3, 9. Ioh. 8, 37, 39. as likewise the church of Rome
has a long time boasted, that it is the church of God, and as other churches
and people also do, when yet they abuse and walk not worthy of that mercy
of God unto them. Besides that Lucifer the king of Babylons vain boasting of
his sitting on the mount of the Congregation, etc. did not hinder, but that it
was in deed the Temple of God, and the Mount of the congregation in the sides
of the North, etc. Esa. 14, 13. Other things here I omit, as being merely
vain in deed: that a particular church should challenge to be the catholic
church (which cannot be, as they understand it) and the Pope to be the head of
the same: which Christ only is, and no other can be, Ephesians. 1, 22, 23. Let
these clauses therefore and all by-matters be omitted, that perteyn not to the
point in hand, and let the thing be simply propounded as it should be, thus,
whether the church of Rome and other churches be Christian churches, or not:
and then let all consider thereof indifferently, that so the truth may be
found out according to the word of God, whatsoever other opinions or prejudice
we have had to the contrary heretofore. And hitherto of these expositions of
this Scripture.

Next, whereas upon the understanding of this Scripture aforesaid, I brought in
two consequences: shevving how it would meet with and convince the errors
both of the Papists and Anabaptists, etc. this Opposite sets himself to
withstand in both, what he can. The first was this, that by the Temple of God
(2 These. 2, 4.) understanding the church of God, it vvil follovv, that
Antichrist should sit in the church of God, and is there to be sought and
found, and not among the Jews, Turks, Pagans, and the like, as the Papists
and others would persuade us: To this he opposes, saying, it is a fallacy
from an insufficient division, because all out of the true church are not
Jews, or Turks, or Pagans, but there is a fourth to make up the mease, even
popish Antichristians, among whom the man of sin is to be found, etc. Where
(omitting, that he sets not down all my words) first I observe, that now he
makes the Popish Antichristians to be the Temple of God, where Antichrist is
to be found: and but erewhile he told us, that by the Temple of God, where
Antichrist sits as God, is to be understood Gods church and people invaded
and destroyed by Antichrist. So as either he thinks the popish Antichristians
to be Gods church and people: or else he forgets and contradicts himself
extreemely.

Secondly, let him tell us, whether the popish Antichristians, of whom he
speaks, be Christians, and in the church of God, or not. If he say, they are
Christians, and in the church of God, he gives us the cause, and does but use
fallacy to deceive the simple, by the term of popish Antichristians: our
question now being of the Temple of God, where Antichrist sits: and so of
fynding him there, among How in other respects, they are or may be termed
popish Antichristians or otherwise, I do not here stand upon.
Christians, and not among the Jews, Turks, Pagans, and the like. If he say,
they are not Christians, nor in the church of God: how then will he show that
Antichrist is to be sought and found among them, seeing he is to be sought and
found in the Temple of God.

Thirdly, I ask when and where those popish Antichristians begun and yet
are, of whom he speaks? Also, whether they were popish Antichristians, and
not the churches of God, before Antichrist invaded and sat among them, or
became to be such afterward. If he say, they were so before, let him tell us
who they were, and show that such then was their estate. If he say, they
became so afterward, let him then tell us, what they were before, whether
Christians and the church of God, or not: and how long it was afterward, ere
they ceased so to be: and who they are, of whom thus he speaks: remembering
still to distinguish betvveen Antichrist, and the Temple of God where he
sits.

Fourthly, let him remember, how ill he took it, when M. Sm. (speaking of Rev.
11, 2.) applied the Court of the Temple, to the assemblies of Antichrist. Which
interpretation then he called Def. of Scrip. p. 12 13, 14, 15.
impiety, dotage, his fancy, blyndnes of heart, abuse of the lord of God,
etc. If he could not endure, that he should so interpret the court of the
Temple, (spoken of by John) how is it that now himself thus expounds the Temple
of God (spoken of by Paul) to be popish Antichristians? If it were then
impiety, dotage, a fancy, blyndnes, and abuse of Gods word, so to expound and
apply it, what thinks he it is now?

Fifthly, where he says further, that in the true church Antichrist the man of
sin has sometimes ben found raunging as a wolf, but not reigning as a God,
which in his own Temple he does: First I ask, what true church it is, whereof
thus he speaks, that the man of sin Antichrist has been found raunging
therein as a wolf. Secondly, note how now he understands sitting as God, to be
reigning as a God: which here before he understood to be invading and
destroying. Thirdly, how that which the Apostle calls the Temple of God, he
still calls the Temple of the man of sin, Antichrists own Temple, etc.
Where in, whether he do not use fallacy, let himself consider, and others
judge.

Finally, touching this Scripture, and this clause thereof, how ever he oppugn
what we propound, let him yet observe how others do understand and apply it.
Whereof I will here give but one instance. More may be produced hereafter. M.
Calvin vvriting upon these words, in the Temple of God, notes this: Calv. in
2 These 2, 4.
By this one word is their error, yea their sluggishnes, sufficiently
refuted, who do therefore account the Pope to be the Vicar of Christ, because
he has his fear in the church, howsoever he carry himself. For Paul places
Antichrist no other where, then in the very Sanctuary of God. For he is no
outward enemy, but an homebred or household enemy, which under the very name
of Christ oppugneth Christ. But it is demanded, how a den of so many
superstitions may be called the church, which ought to be the pillar of truth.
I answer that so it is called, not because it reteyneth all the qualities of
the church, but because it has somewhat remaining. Therefore I acknowledge it
to be the Temple of God, wherein the Pope rules, but profaned with innumerable
sacriledges. Calv. in 2 These. 2.4. And thus do other the best vvriters both
old and new understand this Scripture, of the Church of God, So as his
opposition is not only against us, but in deed against the best vvriters in
all ages. And hitherto of the first consequence, which I inferred upon the
understanding of this Scripture aforesaid, which more specially concerns the
Papists, and others likewise minded thereabout.

Another consequence also I inferred upon the same ground against the
Anabaptists and such as incline unto them herein: Namely, that by the Temple of
God (spoken off 2 These. 2, 4.) understanding the church of God, it will follovv,
that Antichrist should sit in the church of God, and that therefore he is there
to be found, and does not wholly take away the church of God, and every truth
and ordinance of the Lord, as Anabaptists, and such as are herein
Anabaptistically inclined, would bear us in hand. To this he answers, Neither
did the Devil take away wholy every truth and ordinance of God from among
the heathens: but they retained many rites of Gods worship received from their
Fathers, as Animad. p. 70.
before is noted. But why now says he not that the Devil took not away
wholy the church of God from among the heathens? Why leaves he out this
clause, which he savv I mentioned about Antichrist, that he takes not away
wholly the church of God, etc. Is it because he can find no answer, and yet
will not yield to the truth: and therefore rather then he will not oppose,
uses these shifts and slye conveyances: thinking that his followers vvil not
observe these sleights of his. How ever it be, let the reader observe, that
himself sees the heathens have not the church of God, as the church of Rome,
where Antichrist sits has: and that therefore fetching his answer from the
heathens, he does wholy leave out this clause of the Church of God, which
they have not among them in their estate: and so in deed gives us the cause,
whiles he would seem to oppugn it.

And whereas he says, the Devil has not taken away wholy every truth and
ordinance of God among the heathens: it is nothing to the purpose, seeing they
are not the church and people of God, under his covenant: neither do so enjoy
any of them. Take an instance in one of the particulars which he mentioned
before, where he said, that the heathens reteyne baptismes or washings among
them: yet when any of them leave that estate, and come to the faith and church
of Christ, they are to be baptized into the Lords name, and to receive the
seal of his covenant given to his church, which they had not before. But so
may not be done, with those that have received baptism in the church of Rome,
or any other apostate churches, when they leave such estate: because they are
already baptized into the name of Christ, and have in those Churches received
the seal of Gods covenant, which the heathens have not: As I have showed Page
27, etc.
here before more particularly. And this is always a sure ground and firm
rule to be observed, The Lord shows his word unto Jacob, his statutes and
his judgments unto Israel: He has not dealt so with any nation: and as for
his judgments, they have not known them. Psalm. 147, 19, 20. That which (he
says) he noted here before, is Page 94, etc.
before ansvvered: vvhither I refer the Reader.

And where he says next, that the Devil and Antichrist, so much as in them
lay, and as stood with the safety of their deceitful kingdom, have sought
wholly to take away the church and truth of God, and to put lies in the
place: this is against him self: both implying that it was not wholy done
(which is the thing that we say, and he oppugneth) and manifestly shevving
that Gods goodness and power superabounded above all the malice and iniquity of
the Devil and Antichrist: which therefore we should all observe with
thankfulness to God, and not obscure or oppugn, as the Anabaptists and this man
does, what they can. Besides that Gods goodness and power did yet more appear,
in nourishing the woman (his church) in the wilderness, from the presence of
the serpent, Rev. 12, 14. Like as before, the Lord measured the Temple and
Altar and worshippers therein: which were most inward and secret to himself:
whenas he gave the Court of the Temple (resembling the outward visible estate
of the church) into the hands of the Gentiles, (the Antichristian apostates and
persecuters) and the holy City to be trodden upon by them: which Court and City
notwithstanding were still the Lords, though thus exposed and dealt with, for
the time appointed. Whereabout I have noted some fevv things Page 128, 129,
130, etc.
here before: which the Reader may make use off concerning this matter. Other
things that might be observed thereabout, I do not now enter into, or insist
upon.

For the last thing, which he alleges, out of that which I vvrote heretofore:
even in it also there is sufficient for confirmation of this matter against
himself and for us, inasmuch as the apostasy of Antichrist the man of sin
Answ. to M. Ja. p. 137.
could not justly be accounted a mystery of iniquity, and truly said to
speak lies in hypocrisy, also privily to bring in damnable heresies, and to
have a show of godlynes, if they did absolutely and wholy depart from the
faith, and not only from some points thereof, etc. And hitherto of the
understanding of the Apostles words, where he speaks of Antichrists sitting
in the Temple of God, 2 These. 2, 4. and of the two inferences thereupon,
against the Papists and Anabaptists, etc. In all which, this man opposes, what
he can: thus choosing rather to strengthen such in their errors, then he will
seem to have erred himself, or cease to oppose us thereabout.

Of Gods people in Babylon, spoken off, Rev. 18, 4.
Next, I observed Advert. page 59.
here again (as I had done before concerning the baptism had in the church of
Rome) that which is said, Rev. 18, 4. Go out of her my people, and partake not
in her sins, etc. Whereupon I inferred, that those words, my people, imply
the covenant of God continued among them. For thus is the covenant taught and
set down unto us in the Scripture, I will be your God, and you shall be my
people. etc. This also he sets to oppose in words, but confirms it in
deed, though against his will. For what does he answer? Animad. p. 80.
These very words (says he) are taken from Ier. 51, 45. My people go out of
the midst of her: where by my people, the church of Babylon is not meant; but
the Israelites, etc. Very well. But are not those words, My people, the words
of the covenant, as I said? And were not that people now in Babylon, the
church and people of God, under his covenant? Had not that people also polluted
the Temple of the Lord, and fallen into notorious idolatry, apostasy, and
other iniquity, for which they were given by the Lord into the hands of the
Babylonians: and were they not still the Lords church and people, his
vineyard, and heritage notvvithstanding? 2 Chronicles. 36, 14 -- 20. with Jer. 12, 7
-- 10. and 20, 4. Lamen. 1, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15. etc. Esa. 63, 10, 17, 18, 19. Is
there not difference moreover to be put between the people of God in Babylon,
and between Babylon it self? How else will he make this speech and case in the
Revelation, to accord with that other spoken of by the Prophet: from whence
(himself says) these very words are taken: if that there be not now (as there
was of old in Babylon of Chaldea) the people of God, under his covenant
continued among them, in the mystical Babylon of the Beast, whether it be
applied to the city of Rome, the throne of Antichrist and jurisdiction thereof;
or to the apostasy of the church of Rome, wherein the man of sin sits
and dominereth. Whereabout see more Page 152, 153, 154, etc.
here before.

And to make this matter yet more plain, observe moreover in the Prophet
Zachary, how afterward he speaking of the same matter, and same estate of the
people, says thus: Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of Of Chaldea:
which was north from Iewry.
the North, says the Lord: for I have spread you abroad as the four wynds of
the heaven, says the Lord. Deliver thy self, O Zion, that dvvellest with the
daughter of Babylon. Zac. 2, 6, 7. Where mark first, how for those words of
Jeremy, my people, Zachary here has, O Zion: and then also, how plainly his
speech shows, that Zion is in Babylon: not mount Sion it self wherein the
Temple was built, which was in the land of Canaan, but the people of God, the
Jews, that perteined to Zion: among whom when God set his Temple there, he
said withal, 1 King. 6, 13. Psalm. 132, 13, 14
I will dwell in the midst of you: showing that the Temple was a token of his
presence among them, and a band of the holy and mutual conjunction that was
between God and them, whither they were bound to come to the worship of God,
and thither to bring their sacrifices, etc. This Temple of God 2 Chronicles. 36, 14,
etc
they profaned most sinfully, falling into idolatry and apostasy, and
committing many other abominations, for which the Lord gave them into the
hands of their enemies, who slew many of them with the svvord, and captived
others of them in the land of the North, in Babylon, etc. This people that had
thus sinned, that was thus captived and punished, that dwelled with the
daughter of Babylon: the Lord still accounts and calls his people, yea he
esteems them to be Zion, which he chose, and where he dwelled: whom therefore
(after he had a while captived and chastised them in Babylon for their sins)
he calls from thence again in his mercy.

So then note here these particulars, concerning the point in hand. 1, That the
people of God pollute his Temple, become apostates and idolaters, and are
captived in Babylon. 2. That thus now Sion is in Babylon; and consequently the
Temple of God (so to speak) the people of God the church of God, is in Babylon.
3. That yet still they are notwithstanding acknowledged by the Lord, to be
Sion, to be his people, and so still to be under his covenant, though they be
in Babylon. 4. That the Lord calls them again from thence: by diverse of his
Prophets, and at sundry times: as may appear by comparing together, Jer. 50,
45. and Zach. 2, 6, 7. with Esa. 48, 20, etc. 5. That when they were by the
Lord thus called away from thence, yet they did not all come together at once,
but some after other at several times. As namely, that some (in the first
year of Cyrus) came out at the first with Zerubbabell and Joshua: Ezra. 1,
and 2, chap. and Neh. 7, chapt. who afterward being hindered for some time in
the building of the Temple, were encouraged again to the work by the
Prophets, Aggee and Zachary. Ezra. 3, and 4, and 5, and 6 chap. In which time
again Zachary (about the second year of Darius) called upon the rest, that
yet remained in Babylon, that they likewise should come out from thence: whom
still he acknowledges to be Sion, though yet they were in Babylon. Zach. 2,
6, 7. etc. with 1, 7. and 6, 10. and 7, 1. And some also afterward returned
with Ezra, in the seventh year of the said Darius Artaxerxes, Ezra. 7, 1 -- 7.
etc. Which is Romans 15, 4. 1 Cor. 10, 11.
now likewise to be observed about the Lords calling of his people, and their
coming, out of this other Babylon: who (as the former) come not from thence
together all at once, but some after other at several times: and that in such
sort, as there will be of Gods people yet called from thence, even then when
this Babylon (the City of Rome) shall come to be burnt with fire, and to be
cast down to the ground, never to rise up again any more. Rev. 18, 4. with
ver. 8, etc. Whereof (by other occasion) I have spoken here also before: Page
138, 152, 153.
and will not now further insist thereupon.

Neither will I enter to speak of other things, that might here be observed:
As namely, that he uses the term of the church of Babylon (speaking of
Babylon in Chaldea) when either he means the City of Babylon, or speaks
not according to the Prophets speech here: but in deed uses colorable words
to deceive the Reader: as if now there had been some other church of Babylon,
besides the Israelites, the people of God, here spoken off. Jer. 51, 45.

Also, that here he calls the Israelites, Gods lost sheep scattered there,
upon the mountains and hills, whom first the king of Ashur had devoured, etc.
which may be referred not only to Judah, but to Israel also of the ten
tribes: as may appear, by the Prophets words, Ier. 50.4, 17, 18, 19, 20.
compared with 2 Kin. 15, 19, 20, 29. and 17, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. So here then he
acknowledges Israel to be Gods lost sheep, asvvell as Judah: whom Animad. p.
82.
other where he denies to be the people of God, in their apostasy.

And moreover, that he says God will receive them into covenant, whom he
calls out of Babylon, or, We are become as they over whom from the beginning
thou bareft no rule neither is thy nam^ called upon them.
if they obey his voice calling them out of her: as if they were not already
under the covenant of God, being his people: or as if they could be the Lords
people (as here the Lord himself acknowledges the^ to be) and yet not be
under his covenant. The Jews themselves knew better, when they were in
Babylon, and thereupon grounded their requests to the Lord, and prayed, saying,
O Lord why have thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our heart
from thy fear? Return for thy servants sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.
The people of thine holiness have possessed the land but a little while: our
adversaries have trodden down thy Sanctuary. 'We are thine, thou never bareft
rule over them, they were not called by thy name. Esa. 63, 17, 18, 19. And
again, Thou have hid thy face from us, and have consumed us because of our
iniquities: But now, O Lord, thou art our Father: we are the clay, and thou
our potter, and we all are the work of thine hand. Be not wroth very sore, O
Lord, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see we beseech thee, we
are all thy people. etc. Esa. 64, 7, 8, 9.

These and the like things I omit further to treat off. That which is said
already, is enough to clear the matter sufficiently. But seeing there is
reference here to the alleging of ' this Scripture before; where also I
insisted upon these words (My people,) about the Baptism had in the church of
Rome, etc. there is a point or two of weight to be observed thereabout, which
being not spoken off before, and fitly perteyning to the matter now in hand, I
can not therefore omit here briefly to touch them. Thus then it is: Among other
reasons touching the baptism aforesaid, I used this:

The Baptism had in apostate churches either is a seal of the covenant of
God, or not. If it be a seal of the Lords covenant, then sure it is true
baptism. If it be not, then see what great things will follow thereupon: As
first, that they which have no other baptism but it, This clause he passes
over, in his answer. Animadv. p. 71.
have not the outward baptism that seals unto them the covenant of God: and
therefore must with the Anabaptists get another, that they may be assured they
have the seal of Gods covenant of grace and salvation.

Secondly, that there neither have been nor shall be in Babylon any of Gods
people under his covenant: which is contrary to that is written, Rev. 18.4.
where the Lord shows that he has his people, whom by the words of his
covenant he calls thence, saying, Come out of her, my people, etc. This also
he neither mentions nor answers.
And if these men will say, that themselves are not of such people there spoken
unto, then let them tell us, when and how they came under the covenant of God:
and let them also show it without stablishing their own righteousness of
works thereby.

Thirdly, that the baptism now had in apostate Churches is not answerable to
the circumcision had in the apostasy of Israel: For that circumcision (though
had in apostasy) was true circumcision, All this which here follovveth to the
end, he includes in an etc.
and a seal of the Lords covenant, to his people, and therefore needed not to
be renounced or repeated. But the Baptism now had in the apostasy of the
church of Rome, they say is not true baptism, and so not a seal of the Lords
covenant to his people now, as the other was then: therefore it must be
renounced, and another that is true obtained. And thus again in this they make
themselves (and would make us) strangers from the policy of Israel, as in
the point of government also was observed.

Neither will it now help them to allege those Scriptures, or the like, as we
have produced heretofore against the Anabaptists, to approve the reteyning of
our baptism had in Apostasy, without renunciation or repetition thereof: as
namely, 2 Chronicles. 30 chapter compared with Exo. 12, 48, 49. Genesis 17.10 -- 13. Levit.
26.14 -- 44, 45, 46. Deuteronomy. 4, 25 -- 31. 2 King. 9, 6. and 13, 23. Psalm. 78, 9
-- 38. and 89.30 -- 34. Ezech. 16.44 -- 63. and 43, 7, 8, 9. 2 These. 2.3 -- 8.
Romans 11, 2 -- 5. and 15.4. etc. For now it will be answered them, that in
Isreal's apostasy they kept circumcision, which needed not be repeated, seeing
it was true, and sealed Gods covenant unto them: but that these cannot so
plead for the baptism had in the apostasy of Rome, because themselves say,
the baptism of the church of Rome is not true baptism, and so not the seal
of Gods covenant to them which have no other but it. Whereunto what they will
answer, let them bethink themselves. And let them show us, by what Scriptures
they can approve their standing now, who wittingly and willingly remain
without true baptism, to seal unto them the covenant of God in Jesus Christ.
Advertis. page 56, 57,

This was part of my answer to these men's Articles concerning this matter.
Whereunto what answer this Opposite returns again, may be seen in his
Animadver. page 71, 72. Where now by this occasion I thought it not amiss,
here to vvish the reader to observe, how this man being not able soundly to
answer these particulars, shifts so about them (after his manner) as some of
them he neither mentions nor offers to answer at all, though they be
special points of weight, which should not be omitted, neither would be, if
he could find answer thereunto. For example, this for one, If the baptism had
in apostate Churches be not a seal of the covenant of God, then they which
have no other baptism but it, have not the outward baptism that seals unto
them the covenant of God, and therefore etc. And this for another, That if God
have not now his people, that are under his covenant (though yet remaining in
Babylon) and that themselves also were such heretofore, as there are spoken
off, that then they would tell us, when, and how they came under the covenant
of God: and show it also without stablishing their own righteousness of works
thereby. Whereunto let the Reader see, if he give any word of answer, but
passes it by, both unmentioned and unansvvered. Other such things let the
Reader himself observe here and other where. And now that by this occasion I
manifest these shifts and sleights of his: let his followers get of him (if
they can) a sound answer to these particulars hereabout.

1. Seeing he denies the baptism had in apostate churches, to be the seal of
Gods covenant: that therefore he would show, when and where himself and they
received an outvvard baptism, that seals Gods covenant unto them, etc.

2. That he would show, whether they were under the covenant of God, before
they were baptized; or came under it since. If before, whether then both their
parents and themselves were not under the covenant of God, which the Lord has
continued in apostate churches, notwithstanding the defection thereof. If
since, when and how they came under the covenant of God: And where they
received baptism, (the Lords sign of entrance into his covenant) since they
came under it: Or where ever they find in the Scriptures, that God ordained
that men should first be baptized, before they be under his covenant: Or that
the people of God have so vvalked, etc.

3. Seeing he yields not, that now there are in Babylon the people of God,
under his covenant; nor that themselves are such, whom the Lord has called
from thence: let him moreover in this respect tell both when and how they
came under the covenant of God: and let him show it also without stablishing
their own righteousness of works thereby: like as the Anabaptists do, in
this behalf.

4. That he speak now also (being better advised then heretofore) whether the
Baptism received in the Church of Rome and other apostate Churches, be
answerable to the circumcision had in the apostasy of Israel, yea and of
Judah also. And whether that Circumcision then were not, and this Baptism
now be not, the Lords sign and seal of his covenant of grace, etc. Or if
not, how then they can either soundly answer the Anabaptists; or conscionably
approve their own standing, who wittingly and willingly remain without the
Lords sign of true Baptism outwardly received, to seal unto the^ Gods
covenant of grace in Jesus Christ: And finally, how they can come to the Lords
table, without the Lords sign of Baptism first outwardly had, but that they
must needs fall into high transgression against God; and profanation of his
holy things; to the provoking of his wrath against them more and more, til
they repent and amend their ways. And that also the more, seeing they have
had so long and often warning thereof given unto them.

These things (if they can) let them get him to answer by the word of God,
syncerely and soundly; if they will walk conscionably herein, as they ought
to do. To us, they may see, he cannot answer them: but with sleights and
evasions puts them of: persuading the Reader that nothing is proved by us,
when any may see that nothing in deed is answered by himself: but that
sometimes he passes by things wholy which should specially be insisted on
and answered; sometimes where he would answer, cannot find any, but with
glosing speeches caryes away the Reader what he can; and sometimes brings that
(as he thinks) against us, which (being well observed) is in deed for us,
and against himself. As may be seen in the last points now treated off:
besides the like in other here noted before, and that may be observed
throughout his treatise.

And hitherto of this point, concerning Gods people, and their being under his
covenant, even whiles they are in Babylon. Rev. 18, 4.

Of Israel heretofore, and Christian Churches since, being in Apostasy and
Defection.
A further declaration hereof I took Advertis. p. 59.
from the example of Israel. For having alleged, that those words, My people,
imply the covenant of God, which is, I will be your God, and you shall be my
people; I annexed thereupon, And so is Israel often called the Lords people,
and is thus spoken off in the time of their apostasy, by the Prophets: 2 King.
9, 6. and 13, 23. 2 Chronicles. 30, 6 -- 9. Hos. 4, 6 -- 12. and 5, 4. and 14, 2.
Amos 7, 15. and 8, 2, etc. Whereunto this opposite not finding what to answer
Animad. p. 81, etc.
betaketh himself to his woonted shifts and evasions, and thereupon answers,
that we prove not the Question. Where let the reader judge, whether the point
in hand touching that phrase of Gods people to imply the covenant of God, be
not proved by the example of Israel, and the Prophets use of that speech
concerning them. And that so plainly, as this man himself is glad to pass over
the Scriptures here alleged, without insisting thereon. Moreover, the
question here in hand being, concerning the Temple of God, spoken off 2 These
2.4. whereabout I alleged also that term and estate of the people of God,
spoken off Rev. 18, 4. he keeps not hereunto, as he should: but flees to
Babylon, there to seek some evasion, if he could.

Of this vvoonted course of his in not keeping the Apostles words (the Temple
of God) whereabout our question is, but in stead thereof using the terms of
the Antichristian church, Babylon, and the like, I have spoken Page 144.
here before: and need not repeat it. As also of the term Page 129
Gentiles: by the sound whereof he would now carry away the Reader, whenas
heretofore (in Def. against M. Sm. p. 12, 13, 14, 15.
the very place here cited by himself) he could distinguish betvveene these
Gentiles, and the Court of the Temple here spoken off: Rev. 11, 2, 9, 18. Where
likewise there is Rev. 11 ch
manifest reference made (in diverse respects) not only to Israel, but also to
Judah: Which may assure us, that these are true and fit types also of the
things here spoken of, concerning the church of Rome and other churches in
apostasy and defection. For which see here before, page 127, etc. And still
remember, that the very term of the Temple of God, 2 These. 2, 4. and Rev. 11,
2. besides all the other things follovving in the same chapter, teach the same
thing undeniably. For which also see before, page 124 -- 127. etc.

His next answer is touching Israel it self: where he labors to disprove,
what I alleged concerning them out of the Prophets: but yet medleth not with
the Scriptures, which I cited hereabout, and which are well to be observed
about the point in hand: besides that in his discourse (after his manner) he
uses what other shifts he can, and falls into sundry errors, and great abuse
of the Scriptures, as I have more largely shevved Page 96. 97, etc.
here before, treating of this matter, and of some special things concerning
Israel, which here he insisteth on more particularly. To which therefore I
refer the Reader.

And having now entreated already so largely both of Israel, and the church of
Rome, and other churches in apostasy and defection, as the Reader may see I
have done: I shall not, for the residue of his treatise, insist upon every
particular from point to point. For so I might write many books and volumes
thereabout. And in this I have already written much more, then I thought to
have done, when first I began it. For the rest therefore of his discourse, it
shall suffice to note a few (of the many) errors, evasions, contradictions, and
other such stuf, wherewith his treatise abounds throughout: leaving it to
the Reader to esteem of them and the like, which he may observe himself, as he
shall find them for to be.

Errors, evasions, contradictions. etc.
1. That the Temple of God, spoken off by the Apostle, 2 These. 2, 4. is no more
Gods Temple, Animadv. p. 82. etc.
then were Ieroboams Idol temples in Israel, and Bells Temple in Babylon.
Animadv. page 82. yet he told us but a little before, that it was to be
understood of Gods church and people, invaded and destroyed by Antichrist, as
the heathens of old dealt with Jerusalem and the dvvellers therein. Ibid. page
80.

Pa. 83, and 84, etc.
2. That he makes not only Babylon, but the Beast himself, and the Church to
be all one. Whereas the Scripture teaches us again and again, to distinguish
betvveen Babylon, and Gods people in it; betvveen Babylon, and Sion in it, etc.
as I have shevved here before, out of Jer. 51, 45. and Zach. 2, 7. compared
with Rev. 18, 4. and betvveen the Beast that is the man of sin, and the
church or Temple of God, where he sits and tyrannizeth, etc. 2 These. 2, 3,
4. with Rev. 11, and 13 chapt.

Page 84 and 85, etc.
3. That whereas I observed a tvvofold consideration of the estate of the
church of Rome, and of Israel heretofore: one in respect of the trueths and
ordinances of God still retained among them; another in respect of the mixture
of their own inventions and abominations vvithall: in regard of the one, to
hold and acknovvledge the truth and church of God there, This cause he omits.
against the Anabaptists; in regard of the other to consider and observe their
apostasy and Babylonish confusion, against Antichrist, etc. he does not only
not yield unto it (which thing alone is to much strengthening of the
Anabaptists in their erroneous opinions and courses) but he blames and
oppugneth the comparing of the church of Rome with Israel: saying, They do
but roll the first stone, saying the same things, comparing Antichrists church
with Israel, whereas the holy Ghost compares it with Rev. 11, 2, 8. and 17
5.
the Gentiles, even the most vile, the Sodomites, Egyptians, Babylonians, and
heathen Romans, Page 84. The like he has again in, page 85, and often in his
treatise. Where mark, not only how he strengthens the Anabaptists hands,
but uses also the Anabaptists language and answer. When M. Clyfton, to
approve the reteyning of baptism received in the apostasy of our forefathers,
alleged the example of circumcision received in the apostasy of Israel: M.
Smith then opposing, returned this answer, M. Sm. charact. of the Beast. p. 48.
that the apostasy of Antichrist is deeper then the apostasy of Israel: for
first (says he) Antichristians are not called Israelites, but Babylonians,
Egyptians, Sodomites, Gentiles, in the Revelatio^: whereby the holy spirit of
wisdom gives us to conceive, that he does account the apostasy of
Antichrist equal to Paganism it self, yea to the very vvorst kind of
Paganism. etc. Now let the Reader compare these together: and then let him
consider whether M. Ainsvvorth do not in deed plead the Anabaptists cause:
and that also after their manner, and almost with their very words. As
touching the point it self, I have Page 129 135. etc.
already out of the Scriptures showed, how the word Gentiles may here be
understood, which I need not repeat. Yea M. Ainsw. himself shows Anno^ on
Psa. 59.6. and 54, 5
othervvhere (though now he forget it) that by this term of the Heathens,
David understands the Jews, that were wicked and persecuters, etc. Psalm.
59, 5. And the Prophets often compare Esa. 1, 10 Jer. 23, 14. Ezech. 16, 3, 45,
46. etc. Hos. 12, 7. Amos 9, 7
the Jews to them of Sodom and Gomorrah, to the Canaanites, Ethiopians,
Philistines, Syrians, etc. Will he therefore conclude hereupon, that they were
not the Church and people of God? Not to speak, how the Scripture also
describing the iniquity of Antichrist, and the estate of the Church of Rome,
and other Christian churches in apostasy, has reference often to the estate
of Judah and Israel: as I have showed more largely Page 127. etc.
here before. Which alone is sufficient to convince both M. Ainsw. and M. Sm.
answers, and the Anabaptists errors hereabout.

4. He grants, that in Paul's time, the church of Rome was set in the way of
God, and soon after fell into apostasy. Page 84. Page 84. and 85.
And yet in the next page he says the ordinances of God which are still
retained in that church, are stolen; as when a thief steals a true man's
money. Page 85. Wherein he contradicts himself, and hardens the
Anabaptists. And is (in some respect) as if he should say, when an honest man
having money in his purse that is truly gotten, becomes afterward a thief
and steals some goods of other men's: the money which he had before and still
has, is stolen money, because the other goods are ill come by, which he
gets afterward by unlawful means. Or rather thus, as if he should say,
that when an honest woman becomes an harlot, now all the goods which
lavvfully she had before and still reteyneth, are stolen goods. Thus if he
were the judge, she should be condemned not only of adultery, but of theft.
And note moreover, that when a thief repents, he may not keep but must
restore again all the goods he has stolen. Accordingly then by his doctrine,
if the church of Rome should repent (as Judah often did) of her adulteries; and
when any of that church now do repent, and forsake that apostasy: they
should not reteyn the baptism and other ordinances of God, which that church
has: but should presently part with them, and no longer keep them, seeing
they are stolen goods. How could you ever be thankful enough to M. Ainsvv. (O
ye Anabaptists) for thus pleading your cause, if your opinions were good, and
his arguments and answers sound thereabout.

Page 85.
5. The like error and iniquity he falls into again, vvhiles he matcheth
baptism and the other ordinances of God retained in the church of Rome, with
the feasts, worship and sacrifices of the heathen ( Ephesians. 2, 11, 12.
who were without Christ, being aliens from the common wealth of Israel, and
strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in
the world) yea matcheth these things moreover with the Devil himself, being
transformed into an Angel of light. Page 85. What miserable assertions are
these, and merely Anabaptisticall? Certain it is, that the apostasy of the
church of Rome, and iniquity of Antichrist is extreemely sinful: yet alvvaies
we should remember in cases of apostasy (as in Israel and Judah) to put
difference betvveen the ordinances of God that still are retained in such
estate, and the inventions of men that are taken up of themselves and mixed
vvithall. Which this man not regarding, though it be showed him: vvhiles he
would shun the gulf of Popery, runs his leak bark upon the rocks of
Anabaptistrie.

P. 86 -- 92.
6. He makes a large discourse touching Israel: wherein he has many truths:
which we also hold and urge. But yet notwithstanding he has also some
sleights, errors, and contradictions mixed withal: Whereof take these for
instances: I. That setting down my words, he omitteth some special clauses of
weight: As namely, when I speak of Advert. p. 60, and 61.
a double consideration about the covenant of God made with his people: I
declared it thus, These clauses he omitteth, Animadv. page 86.
one in respect of the Lord himself, on the one part; the other in respect of
the people taken into covenant by him, on the other part. Deuteronomy. 26, 17, 18, 19.
Judge. 2, 1, 20. And again, that in these two respects These clauses he
omitteth, Animadv. page 86.
(sometimes having reference to God, sometimes to Israel) may there many
things be observed to be spoken diversely.

Page 87. etc.
II. That he oppugneth this diversity of consideration hereabout: whereof I
have spoken sufficiently Page ^6, 111, etc.
here before: Which double consideration, whether it be not necessary to be
observed, for the right understanding of the Scriptures, and the estate of
Israel and other churches, let the wise of heart judge. As also, whether he
do not in some things speak so about the covenant, as may establish the
righteousness of works in some respect. Alvvaies remembering, that the covenant
of God, whereof we speak, is this, that the Lord said to Abraham, I will be a
God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. And again, I will be your God, and
you shall be my people. Genesis 17, 7. and 22, 18. Hos. 2, 23. Zac. 13, 9. with
Act. 2, 39. and 3, 25. Romans 9, 25, 26. etc

III. That the typical estate of Israel, is our ensamples. 1 Cor. 10, 6, 11.
Which, Page 87.
when we observe or allege, he sets himself to oppose it, he will not
admit it, he excepts against it, etc. But for himself, he will use it, he
will insist upon it; no man more: as in all his vvritings may be seen. And if
he may do it, may not we also? Came the word of God out from him? or is it
come to him only? 1 Cor. 14, 36.

IIII. That he pretends and pleads as if he would persuade, Page 88.
that God brake the covenant on his part with Israel, when all the tribes were
together, Page 88, etc. and yet afterward in the same page says, that whiles
Israel was one, they continued Gods Church. Page 88.

V. That he shuffles together the estates of Israel, Pa. 88, 89, 90, and 91.
when they were one body, and when they were rent in two: Also, whilst
Israel was in the land and presence of the Lord; and when they were cast out
of his house and presence. Which I have shevved Page 70, 71, 78, 101 etc.
here before: and which the Reader may here again observe, if he do but note
the Scriptures which now he cites, and the cases spoken off, and the times
wherein they fell out. As namely, the things spoken off, in Deuteronomy. 1, and 2.
Exodus 34. Judge. 1. and 2. Animadv. p. 88. 89, 90, 91.
Number, 14, etc. when they were al together. And 2 Chronicles. 11. and 15. and 25. and
1 King. 13. Hos. 4. and 5. and 8. and 11. Amo. 9, etc. when the ten tribes had
left Judah: as also whiles yet they were in the Land. And finally, 2 King. 17.
with Hos. 1, 9. and 2 chap. Jer. 3, 8. etc. which speak of the estate of
Israel, when they were cast out of the land, as out of the house and presence
of God, and had the bill of divorce given them, that is here spoken off, etc.
Which places, times, and cases, how he confounds, the Reader may observe;
and how needful it is to distinguish them, may appear by the things
themselves as I have shevved more largely heretofore: page 70, 78, 101, etc. to
which I refer the Reader.

Whereunto now I annex this, that among other things, Pa. 82, and 91.
the place in Hos. 1, 9. which he cited before, and here again, might have
taught him better to consider hereof: both in respect of the several times of
the birth of the children there spoken off, whereof that of Lo-ammi, not my
people, was the last; and because the Lord does there expressly use a word of
the future tense (I will not be or, your God: or for you, etc.
yours) shevving that their case should afterward come to be otherwise, then
now it was as yet, vvhiles these types and prophecies were given them, and
vvhiles as yet they were in the land. Of which also, see more here before,
page 77, 78. etc.

VI. That he says, if we cannot prove Babylon in Chaldea to be Gods church,
Page 92.
when the Jews were there captived, Ier. 50. and 51. we shall never prove
the Temple of God spoken off 2 These. 2, 4. to be Gods true church. For about
this, is our question and reasoning: how ever he please still to term it, the
Synagogue of Satan, etc. Of which, see here before, page 124, 143, 144. etc.
And this Babylon (he knows) was then merely an heathenish City and people,
whereas the Temple of God here spoken of, himself acknowledges Animad. p. 80.
othervvhere to be understood of the church and people of God, answerable to
Jerusalem and the dwellers therein. Animad. p. 80.

7. That where I spoke Advert. p. 62.
of the word Church, being taken sometimes more largely, sometimes more
strictly: which about the question (concerning the church of Rome) may
likewise be observed: he omitteth Animad. p. 92.
this point, and does not so much as mention it: whether not willing to
meddle with it, or not regarding it: whereas other both learned and godly men
do observe and note it. Keckerman vvriting of the church, says, The church is
taken largely, or strictly. The Church largely taken, is a company of men, that
profess Christ to be their King, Priest and Prophet. And touching the Church
thus taken, there be these general rules. I. The Church is of those things,
which have one name, and diverse significations, or, where diverse things are
signified by one word: which cannot be comprehended in one essential and
general definition. 2. But the profession of the doctrine of Christ and
acknowledgment of his Prophetical Priestly and kingly office, generally and
howsoever taken, is the form of the church largely considered. 3. Thus
therefore the Church being taken, conteyneth even the reprobate and hypocrites,
as members: to wit, so long as they prosesse Christ the Prophet, Priest and
King any manner way. Keckerman. System. Theolog. l. 3. c. 6. p. 370.

8. Where I observed Advert. p. 62, 63.
a double regard, that may be had of apostate Churches in all ages, according
as they are considered and spoken of, in comparison with other people of diverse
sorts. As namely, that Israel in apostasy, being compared with the Syrians,
Philistimes, Moabites, and other nations are called and ought to be accounted
the people of God, who have the only true God for their God, etc. 2 King. 5,
8, 15, 17. and 9, 6. etc. But being compared with Judah, which ruled with God,
and was faithful with the Saints, she is called an harlot, not the wife of God,
but an whore, committing adultery, and compassing God about with lies and
deceit, etc. Hos. 2, 2, 5. and 4, 15. and 5, 3, 4. and 9, 1. and 11, 12. etc.
And in like manner, that the Church of Rome in apostasy, being compared with
the Jews, Turks, and Pagans, they are and ought to be accomted Christians, and
the Temple of God. Where also is verified that which the Apostle spoke of
Antichrists sitting in the Temple of God, 2 These. 2, 4. not the Temple of
Jerusalem, as some to turn away the truth, have imagined) but the Temple of
Christians, the church of God, brought to the faith of Christ, and professing
to be Christians: as may appear by these Scriptures, and the like compared
together. 2 These. 2, 4. with Ezech. 43, 7, 8. Zach. 6, 12, 13. Ephesians. 2, 11 --
13, 19, 21. 2 Cor. 6, 16. Rev. 11, 19. This clause he omitteth.
and as it is also understood by all sound writers both old and new. But
again, being compared with the ancient Church of Rome and other primitive
churches, in the Apostles times, and such as now walk in their steps and in the
good and old way, ruling with God, and abiding faithful with his Saints: she
is called and is to be esteemed an harlot, the great who^e, the mother of the
whoredoms and abominations of the earth, believing and speaking lies in
hypocrisy, giving heed to seducing spirits, and having pleasure in
unrighteousnes etc. Rev. 17. 1, 5. 1 Timothy 4, 1, 2, 3. 2 These, 2, 3 -- 10, 11,
12. And that thus there being in diverse respects) a double consideration had of
the Church of Rome now, as of Israel heretofore, it will appear how in one
respect it may be said, there is the church of God or a true church there, and
in another respect, there is an apostate or a false church there, as it is said
of the same woman, that she is dead and alive, in diverse respects, 1 Timothy 5, 6.
These also he mentions not.
And of the Jews, that they are enemies in one respect, and yet beloved in
another, Romans 11, 28. So John Baptist is Elias, and is not Elias, in diverse
respects. Ioh. 1, 21. with Matt. 11, 7 -- 14. and 17, 10 -- 13. Judas is an
apostle, and yet a devil. Mat. 10, 2, 4. with Ioh. 6, 70. The Jews are the
children of Abraham, and yet the children of the devil: Ioh. 8, 33, 34. As the
Prophets also called the Jews, the seed of the wicked, the seed of the
adulterer, and a false seed, in one respect, when in other respects they
acknowledge them to be the seed of Abraham, Jacob and Israel, and so a true
seed and people of the Lord. Esa 1, 4. and 5^, 3, 4. with 41, 8. and 45, 19.
and 58, 1. Hos. 2, 1, 2. and 4, 15. Esa. 63, 16, 17. and 64, 9. Ier. 31, 36,
37. Hos. 4, 6, 12. and 5, 4. and 14, 2, 3, 4. And endless it were to recount the
many speeches and several considerations of things thus spoken off in the
Scriptures. Christ is without Father and without mother, Heb. 7, 3. and yet he
has Father and mother, Luke 2, 48, 49. Ioh. 1, 18. and 2, 3. Christ was put to
death in the flesh, but quickened in the spirit, 1 Pet. 3, 18. Abraham is
unrighteous in him self, but righteous by faith. Romans 4.3.5. The Apostle Paul,
and all the regenerate serve the law of God, and the law of sin: the one with
the mind, the other with the flesh. Romans 7.25. Peter is a disciple and an
Apostle, yet in other respect is by Christ called Satan. Mat. 10, 2. and 16,
23. A leprous Jew is a true man and an Israelite, but a corrupt diseased man,
to be put and kept out of the host of Israel, till he be clean. Lev. 13. and
14. with 2 Chronicles. 26, 20, 21. Numb. 12, 10 -- 15. The Temple is the house of
God, and yet is made a den of thieues. Mat. 21, 13. The Emperors of Rome, of
Babylon, and the other nations are kings and higher powers ordained of God.
Romans 13, 1. with Rev. 17, 10. and Dan. 7, 17. yet are they also in other
respects Beasts, Lions, Bears, Leopards, etc. Rev. 12, 3. and 13, 1, 2. with
Dan 7, 3 -- 6. So likewise the beast was, and is not, and yet is, Rev. 17, 8.
And a number the like that may be observed in other places of the Scriptures
compared together.

M. Ainsvv. coming to answer, and treat of this double regard aforesaid,
Animad. p. 92, 93, 94, 95, 96.
sets himself to except and oppose, what he can: and finding the light of
the truth herein to be so evident as it is, is driven diverse times to yield
unto it: which yet he does in such sort, as even then also he cease not to
except and oppugn after his manner: as the Reader in his treatise may observe.
Now how needful and profitable the consideration of this double regard is,
both about this and other questions in religion, I leave to the judgment of
such as are of judgment and indifferency: and that it may the better be
considered of, I have here again set it down, as I did heretofore.

Whereunto I will now (having this occasion) annex this moreover, touching
Israel, about the point in hand: That when Jonah was commanded by the Lord, to
go to Niniveh that great city, and cry against it: it is said Jon. 1, 3.
he rose up to flee unto Tarshish, from the presence of the Lord: that is
(says Piscator) out of the land of Israel: where the Lord dwelled with his
people. Piscat. in Ion, 1, 3. And that Jonah prophesied in Israel, among the
ten tribes, appears by 2 King. 14, 23, 24, 25, 26. and was himself of Gath
Hepher, a town of the tribe of Zebulun, 2 King. 14, 25. with Josh. 19, 10,
13. Now by this may appear, that Israel (being compared with other nations,
as I noted before) had another consideration and estate in the account of God
and his Prophets, then those nations had. Tarshish, vvhither Jonah now would
flee, is out of the presence of the Lord: as the phrase is here used and
understood. Israel, from whence Jonah flees, is in the presence of the Lord.
And so it is said in the history, the Lord was gracious unto Israel (speaking
of the ten tribes) and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them,
because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaak, and Jacob, and would not destroy
them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet. 2 King. 13, 22, 23. As the
same phrase likewise is used touching Judah, that through the anger of the
Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from
his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 2 King 24,
20. Jer. 15, 1. Whereupon Piscator also compares this phrase with the like
speech in Moses, where Cain said unto the Lord, from thy face shall I be hid:
(Schol. in Genesis 4, 14.) as M. Ainsw. himself does, with those words, And Cain
went out from the presence of the Lord. In his Annot. on Genesis 4, 16. The like
may be observed in Amos his speech to Amaziah, where he calls the land of
Assyria a polluted land, in respect of Israel. Amos 7, 16, 17. And yet in
other respect, the land and people of Israel, not only of the ten tribes, but
of Judah, and all the tribes of Israel together, is said to be polluted and
defiled. Psalm. 106, 38, 39. Jer. 2, 7. and 3, 2, 9. and 16, 18. Hos. 5, 3. and
6, 10. But of this and diverse other things, that may hither be referred, I have
spoken here before more particularly. Page 61, 62. and 114, etc.

Now before I proceed to other things, it will not be amiss to show what some
others have observed about this matter, concerning a diverse consideration of
the church: And namely, what Keckerman (whose judgment I showed here before)
vvriteth further thereabout.

The church [saith he] largely taken is again considered, either distinctly
with opposition to the heathen, or collectiuely in respect of Christians among
themselves. The Christian church, if it be loo^ed upon distinctly in opposition
to the heathen, is the company of al those, which profess Christian religion
(or the name of Christ) in what manner soever, and separate themselves from the
Turks and Pagans. And thus are all heretics, schismatics, and Arians,
Papists, Anabaptists, and such li^e, referred to the Christian Church.

But in respect of Christians distinguished among themselves, the Church
largely taken, is that which worshippeth Christ with a more pure or sincere
profession of doctrine and the Sacraments. And thus our Church gathered in
France, England, Scotland, Low countries, County. Palatine of the Rhene, and
other where, is called That is, of right faith or sound religion.
the orthodoxe Church: and yet with a certain large extension: because not all
who profess our right or sound religion, are elect, but there are also not a
few reprobates and hypocrites vvithall. Therefore must we discern and
distinguish these degrees even in this large signification of the Church:
Namely, that it is either most large, or somewhat stricter: or finally the most
strict, of which we will now treat.

The Church taken strictly and properly, is the company of those men, whom God
the Father has from everlasting chosen to eternal life, and in time
effectually calls them by his spirit, and gathers them into the communion
of his Son Jesus Christ, as being the true Prophet, Priest, and king, or
head: and together also into a mutual union of faith and love among
themselves. Hitherto Keckerm. in his System. Theolog. l. 3. cap. 6. p. 372,
373. This I thought here to insert, being such as may be of good use, for the
better consideration of the Church, in diverse respects. Now I will proceed to
note a few more of this opposites evasions, and errors, etc.

Animadv. p. 93.
9. Where he says, the Turks acknowledge one God, and Christ to be sent of God
with his Gospel, and to be the breath (or spirit) of God: what is this to the
purpose, seeing they do not acknovvledge Jesus to be the Christ, the Son of
God made man, that dyed for our sins, etc. as the church of Rome professes,
and diverse of that Church have dyed in testimony hereof, against the Turks and
Moors, etc. To make it yet more plain, does he think that the Turks make such
profession of Christ, whereby any of them are saved in their estate? And
again, does he think that none of the Church of Rome are saved by the faith of
Christ, which they hold and profess in their estate? Not to speak of the
church of England, of which also, how these men esteem, is not unknowen.

10. Likewise, when he says, The Turks and ^agans are in some things to be
justified, Page 94.
in comparison of the church of Rome: how frivolous is this, and not to the
purpose, for the point in hand? Says not the Prophet, that Jerusalem became so
exceeding sinful, as she justified Samaria, and Sodom, in respect of
themselves, and that they were more righteous then she? Ezech. 16, 46 -- 52.
Also, that the backsliding Israel justified her self more then tretcherous
Judah. Ier. 3, 11. Yea Christ says, it shall be more tolerable for Tire and
Sidon, and Sodom, in the day of judgment, then for Chorazin, Bethsaida, and
Capernaum, where Christ lived, preached, and did miracles himself. Matt. 11.20
-- 24 Shall we therefore think, that Jerusalem and Judah, Chorazin, Bethsaida,
and Capernaum, were not the cities, churches, and people of God? Yet such
reasons and arguments this man brings us.

11. Erroneous also it is and Anabaptisticall, that he says, Ibid.
The Temple of God, spoken off 2 These. 2, 4. is no more the Church and Temple
of God, then the Devil which appeared to the witch at Endor, was Samuel, 1 Samuel 28.14, 15, etc. Also where I compared Ezec. 43, 7, 8. with 2 These. 2, 4.
that this is not fit, but that the type should be set from Bells Temple in
Babylon, where the vessels of Gods true Temple were holden captive (Dan. 1, 2.)
or from the Samaritans Temple builded by Sanballat on mount Garizim, whither
the apostate and wicked Jews used to flee. Joseph. Antiq. Jud l. 11, c. 8. For
let him speak, was the Devil Samuel in deed? was Bells Temple, or the
Samaritans Temple, Gods Temple in deed? as himself said erewhile, that the
temple of God spoken off 2 These. 2, 4. is to be understood of Gods church and
people, answerable to Jerusalem and the dwellers therein. Page 80. Besides that
he knovveth how Augustine says (in the place here before cited by himself)
that the Temple of any Idol or Devil, the Apostle would not call the Temple
of God. August. de civit Dei. l. 20. c. 19.

12. Where I alleged Zach. 6, 12, 13. Ephe. 2, 11 -- 13, 19, 21. 2 Cor. 6, 16.
Page 95.
Rev. 11, 19. and compared them with 2 These 2, 4. to show, that by the Temple
of God here, the Scripture understands not the Temple of Jerusalem, but the
Temple of Christians, the Church of God: he turns away from the point in
question, what he can, and discourses on things agreed upon by all. But to put
him from his shifts, let him tell us plainly, when Paul says, the Temple of
God has not agreement with idols, 2 Cor. 6, 16. if yet there be idols set in
the Temple of God, (as was in the time of Manasseh, Antiochus, and others)
whether now it cease therefore to be the Temple of God, or not. The Scripture
shows that it is the Temple of God notvvithstanding, as I have noted before
out of the history and Prophets. 2 King. 21, 7. Jer. 50, 28. Ezec. 8, 5, 10,
16. Dan. 11, 31, 38. This is the point, whereunto he should keep, if he would
answer to the purpose.

13. And again extreemely erroneous and Anabaptisticall it is, Ibid.
that he says the Church of Rome has not Such is his opinion also touching
the baptism of the church of England.
the true baptism, the one baptism, spoken off, Ephesians. 4, 5. If this be true,
what outward Baptism then have these men themselves? He says, not a true one,
not that one baptism spoken of Ephesians. 4, 5. And what remains then, but that
they must needs become Anabaptists, and get another outvvard baptism then that
they have, if they will walk conscionably: and that in the mean time they
profane the Lords table, and all the holy things of God usurped among them? So
either they must leave their Anabaptistical opinions, or admit of
Anabaptistical courses. Let them choose, which they will. And if they will
not become Anabaptists, let them tell us, whether (in diverse respects) a double
consideration may not be had of the church of Rome as of Israel heretofore,
yea and of Judah also: so as in one respect it may be said, there is the Church
of God or a true Church there (to wit, as the Temple of God, and his people is
there) and that in another respect, there is an apostate or a false Church
there (namely, as Antichrist sits therein, with his apostasy, oppositio^,
exaltation above all that is called God, etc.) and whether moreover it be not
good and needful in such cases to observe how the Scripture speaks diversely
of things in diverse respects: whereof I gave sundry instances. Against which
though he would seem to except what he can, yet he does directly yield unto
it: and that so, as himself affirms here, Page 96.
that things are often in the Scriptures spoken in diverse respects, without
observing whereof, men shall err infinitely. Which whether he have not done,
in his plea about the Baptism and Church of Rome, let himself consider, and
others judge.

14 Whereas for a conclusion, I inferred, that if the things aforesaid and the
like, about apostate churches, and the mixture of man's inventions with Gods
ordinances in apostasy, be distinctly and carefully regarded, they may be
(through the mercy of God) some good means to stay people from Anabaptistrie
and other ill courses, by the consideration of the things that are to be
observed on the one hand: and to bring men more soundly to separation from the
apostasy of Antichrist, by the consideration of the things to be observed on
the other hand. (Advertis. page 65.) this he Page 92, and 97.
passes by: which both he and his followers had need to regard otherwise,
then hitherto they have done, if they vvil walk soundly and syncerely in the
truth, as they ought to do.

15. And whereas I noted, that I had observed and written somewhat tending this
way, long since: as may be seen in the Answer to M. Ja. p. 7. where I spoke of
a double consideration of Christians, in one respect, true, and in another
false: etc. himself knows, that then both he and his followers could well
like of this manner of speech and distinction touching the same persons in
diverse respects: whereas now if like speech be used in some other respect or
occasion, they can make no end of their outcries and evil dealing by word and
P. 76, to 97. besides his letters etc.
vvriting thereabout. If there were no other thing in them, but this their
dealing, they might hereby consider with themselves, that somevvhat doubtless is
amiss with them now, otherwise then heretofore. But they know, we are
acquainted with other things besides, concerning the^.

16. Moreover, whereas I noted, that in the book aforesaid, I had also
written of salvation now had in the church of Rome (Page 13, Page 97.
and 47.) which necessarily implies, the people of God, and his covenant to be
there: because that whosoever are saved, they are the people of God, and under
his covenant in Christ: he fynding no answer or cavil hereabout, says now
here, that they deny not, but there may be of the elect in all false Churches,
even as Satan has his reprobates in the true churches: And that he holds it
presumption for any to limit God, by how small means or measure of faith and
knowledge he will save a man. Yet here before he has often affirmed again and
again, that the church of Rome has not P. 70, 71, 72, 80, 81, 95, 96, etc
the covenant of God; the covenant of grace; the people of God; the baptism of
Christ; the sign and seal of forgiveness of sins and life eternal, etc. And
how then should salvation be had in that church: seeing there is no salvation
to any that are out of the covenant of grace; no salvation but to the people of
God; no salvation without remission of sins. Does he not now then either
contradict himself, or fall in deed into that presumption, which he
disclaymeth in words? And mark vvithall, that though I speak expressly, of the
Church of Rome, and of the people of God, and his covenant to be there: yet he
does not thus speak or acknovvledge particularly of that church, but uses some
general words about the salvation of Gods elect: whether for an evasion
hereafter; or for that already he perceives, if he should so speak, and
acknovvledge it in particular concerning that Church, his contradiction would
be more evident unto al; or for what other cause, himself knows best, and
time may manifest more.

17. Neither is this to be omitted, Page 97.
that to have the more color and evasion, he says, God expressly said, when
he made Israel his peculiar people, that yet Exodus 19, 5.
all the earth was his, which are the words (says he) of the covenant Ezech. 16
8.
generally. And for this, he cites Ezech. 16, 8. with Exodus 19, 5. But what
now is it that he means hereby? If by the covenant, he mean the covenant of
grace for salvation (whereof we treat) and think that all people of the world
in all ages and places of the earth are under it; what differs this, from
the opinion of the Anabaptists, and of the Arminians also, touching general
redemption? If he speak not of the covenant of grace, which is for salvation;
all may perceive he speaks not to the point in hand.

18. And finally, how he uses or rather abuses the Scripture hereabout, who
can not discern? The Lord by the Prophet (in the place which he cites) says
to Jerusalem; when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, the time was
the time of love (that is, the time of marriage) and I spread my skirt over thee
(taking thee to be my wife, under my protection) and I covered thy nakedness:
yea, I swear unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee (to wit, the
covenant of marriage) says the Lord God, and thou becamest mine, that is, my
wife) Ezech. 16, 8. Thus also the Lord has dealt with the church of Rome:
Romans 1, 7. as himself acknowledges diverse times in this Treatise, Animad. p.
84. and 98. etc. But is this now the case and estate of all the earth with the
Lord? Are al in the world become the Lords wife, church, and people, in the
covenant of marriage, etc. Or was all the earth so, and did the Lord so intend
it, when he said to Israel, all the earth was his? Exodus 19, 5. Othervvhere
the Lord says, that Deu. 10, 14. Psalm. 115, 16.
the heaven, and the heaven of heavens is the Lords: and that Psalm. 50, 10, 11,
12.
every beast of the forest is his, and the cattle upon a thousand hills: that
the vvild beasts of the field are his: yea that the world is his, and the
fulness thereof. Shall we therefore think, that the heavens, vvild beasts,
cattle, and whole world, are the wife and church of God, in the covenant of
marriage with him, as Ezekiel speaks of the Jews, in the place which here
he alleges, and by which he would persuade us, that these are the words of
the covenant generally? But I will not follovv this any further: neither the
abuse that he has of other Scriptures every where: which were endless to
prosecute in particular. Only let him consider with himself, how sinful a
thing it is, thus to abuse the word of God, and to take his name in vain, as
he does throughout his treatise. For which he may assure himself, the Lord
will not hold him guiltles, nor leave him unpunished, if he do thus persist,
and will not be reclaymed. Exo. 20, 7. Let him therefore not delay to think on
his ways, and to turn his feet into the testimonies of the Lord. Psalm. 119,
59, 60.

19. When as heretofore about this question concerning the church of Rome, we
annexed somewhat out of the vvritings of M. Iunius against Bellarmine: we
expressly signified, M. Clift. Advertis. p. 20, 21.
that we did it, not as relying upon the judgment of men in causes of
religion, but because we knevv, that many who are carried with a prejudice
against us, would stay themselves the more, when they should see what M Iunius
has written of this argument. Yet as if no such thing at all had been signified
by us, Animad. p. 98.
this opposite does not only pass by it, but pretend as if herein we did or
would stand to his judgment. And this also he makes the more strange,
because sometimes some letters of difference have passed betvveen M. Iunius and
us in some other things. As if we could not differ from him in some things,
and yet like or speak of his judgment in some other. This man himself differs
from him in sundry things: does he not therefore like, or may he not speak, of
his judgment in any thing? But what will he not pretend or except against, to
have some show of help for himself in such time of need? And although it be
certain, that in cases of Religion, we should not rely on the judgment of
man, but on the word of God alone (as we noted before) yet seeing that we
know but in part, and the Word of God is common to all his people, and is not
come to any person or people alone, therefore should we not lightly despise or
reject the judgment of others, and those also godly and learned, but with
reverence and humility regard them: specially when they set themselves not
only to show their judgment, but to bring proof of argument, and that also
from the word of God, as M. Iun. does about the matter in hand.

20. Now therefore that the Reader may see how M. Ainsvv. sets himself
herein not against us alone, but against any other whomsoever, and whatsoever
they allege hereabout; and specially, that he may better consider, what M.
Iunius himself has written of this matter; and how very many things therein of
special weight and use M. Ainsw. has omitted, which are good and needful to
be observed: I have thought it not amiss here again to set down M. Iunius his
own words. Which alone will much help the Reader better to discern the
evasions, errors, abuse of Scripture, and other evil dealing, into which M
Ainsvv. runs on still more and more. Besides that the Reader may by this
means be better informed and directed, how to discern and judge of the
opinions and differences that are at this day hereabout, among whomsoever,
whether Protestants, or Anabaptists, or any other.

M. Iunius his judgment of the Church of Rome: as may be seen in the second
tome of his works in folio, Libro singulari de Eccles. contra Bellarm. cap. 17,
page 1018, 1019. etc.
BEing to treat of the Church of Rome, we will first open the aequivocation, or
diverse signification of the word, before we determine of the thing it self,
that all men may better perceive, what it is, that is at this day called in
question among us. For very many ar deceived with the homonymie or diverse
signification of the very word, and unawares ensnare themselves and others, by
ignorance of the deceitfulnes in the speech.]

The church of Rome [therefore is properly so called, or abusiuely, by the
misterming or abusing of the name, both as it is called a church, and as it is
called the Roman church. For as it is called the Roman church,] sometimes it
properly signifies a company which is at Rome, as Paul spa^e, writing to the
Romans: sometimes it signifies abusiuely, all the Churches on the earth, that
cleave to the Roman church, according to the form of doctrine, and
constitution thereof. But we will simply treat of the church, as it is the
Roman church, or church of Rome: and the things which we shall speak of this
church, the same may the godly reader by proportion understand of the church so
called by abuse of speech.

[Now All this whole passage he omitteth, and all other clauses sentences and
passages that are included in these [].
as it is called a church (which thing chiefly is in controversy) it is so
termed three manner of ways: as a subject, as an accident grown to the
subject, and as the subject together with that his accident. As a subject, it
is the simple or single church of Rome, As an accident grown upon the subject,
it is the papacy, or the papal hierarchy, which they call ecclesiastical. As
a subject compounded with his accident, it is the church of Rome become
papal, or under the pope, that is to say corrupt, as I may so spea^, by that
lawles or unnatural shoot of the Pope, springing out of the stoe^. Now of each
of these we will consider so briefly as we can]

The Church of Rome when it is considered as a subject, it has two parts, the
pastors and the flock of Christ: for which church the Apostle of old gave
thanks to God by Jesus Christ, because her faith was published throughout the
whole world. Romans 1, 8. [And for which we also daily ask of God in our prayers,
that he would inform it to worship him by his spirit in the Gospel of his
son, and to stablish it in the faith.] Neither do we deny this subject to be
even at Rome, [by the mercy of God,] at this day, because we trust there is God
calling, persons called, and the calling it self yet in her: the meeting of
which things together in one gives being to a church, as before we shevved.

But touching the papacy, or the papal hierarchy, which they are wont to
call Ecclesiastical, we say that it is not the church properly, but an accident
grown unto the church, and such as covertly works against the life, and
health of the church. [That it is not the church properly, Here again he omits
clauses, words and passages of special weight.
is proved by the very definition of the papacy, and of the church of God.]
For the papacy [according to his generall] is an order: [the church is a
company or an assembly. The papacy by his difference, is an order positive,]
humane or from men, and naught: The church is an assembly divine or from God,
[by divine authority united together with reason. Now those things which
differ both in their general, and in their essential difference, and in their
necessary conditions or properties, they cannot be one and the same thing. And
that the papacy is an accident grown upon the church, experience it self
speaks. For the subject is before his accident, which is contingent and
separable: The church was many ages when the papacy was not: The papacy came
to the church contingently (beside the being of the church,) and so may be
separated from it, as at this time also there are churches where the papacy is
not, and there will be churches still hereafter without the papacy. Therefore
the papacy is not the church, but it is an evil grown up in the church, a
pestilence, a dropsy, a gangrene in the body, deceitfully working against the
life and health of it, and therefore most dangerously and noysomely eating up
the lively and wholesome moisture of the church. But of this whole matter we
have spo^en in the third controversy, and in this fourth we are to speak of it
hereafter.]

[Therefore concerning the other which remains let us se, whether the papal
Roman church, This also he passes by.
or that which is of the pope, be the church. The opinions which are about this
matter are diverse. The popish generation cry out with full mouth, that it is
absolutely the church. Others not beholding a different regard of the papacy,
from that which is the church, deny it to be the church. We relying both on the
nature of the thing, and on the authority of the Scripture, do put a
difference. The nature of the thing does teach, that the church is one thing,
and that the papacy is another, as we spoke a little before. The authority of
the Scripture teaches the church, but it teaches not the papacy: therefore
they are diverse things. For they delude undoubtedly, I say they delude, which
require at our hands one definition of the subject and of the accident, as of
one singular thing, or obtrude it on us. For thus must we say, The papal
church, as it has that in it which belongs to the definition of a church, it
is a church: but as it has in it the evil grown unto it, which we call the
papacy, in that respect it is not a church, but a faulty or defloured, a
polluted and corrupt church, and drawing on to destruction.]

[Let us ma^e it plain by a similitude. The body it self is one thing, And this
he omits.
the corruption or consumption in the body another thing. The body is the
subject, the corruption or consumption is the evil accident cleaving unto the
subject, the corrupted or consuming body is compounded of them both. There is
both the body, and the consumption in the consuming body. So likewise is a body
that is svvolne with the water, causing the dropsy. Both are together, and
yet so together, as either one of the two, or both together must needs perish.
If the nature of the body be stronger, the consumption cease and the
dropsie-water decays: but if the consumption or dropsy prevail, there is
most certain destruction of them both. So is the church of God: for in it self
it is the body of Jesus Christ. If a deadly disease grow upon it, both are
then together, the body and the disease in the body. If the purging medicine of
the grace of God (for nothing is here natural, be of the more efficacy, the
disease then is vanquished and decays: but if the disease prevail, then both
of them (the body and the disease) must needs come to an end. For such is the
condition of the disease: it both feeds it self on the body decaying, and
destroys it self together with the body.]

And this also.
[After this manner therefore do we esteem of the church of Rome, which they call
the papal or popish church. There is the church, there is the papacy, and
there is the papal church. As there is the church, it is the subject of God: as
there is the papacy, there is the disease of man: as it is the papal church,
there is a fight between the church and the papacy, that will destroy either
one of them apart, or both together. If God shall give it the purging medicine
of his grace, by means whereof the papacy, the accidentarie evil decay and
perish, it is well: but if the papacy, that most faulty and corrupt order, and
deadly accident prevail, it will bring destruction to both of them, both to the
church and to it self, by the judgment of God.]

And this.
[And this now in the memory of our fathers and our own we see to have
befallen many churches, which claue fast unto that Roman church. For when it
seemed good unto God more clearly to light the torch of the gospel, and to
scatter the papal smokes by his spirit, there remained churches returning by
his grace to a better constitution and stronger health, and that which was of
the Pope departed vanishing away of it own corruption: but when as God sent not
that purging medicine of his divine grace into the body of any church, then the
popish corrupt blood got strength more and more, which will be to that church
deadly destruction, unles God of his mercy provide a remedy. In the
remembrance and conscience of this benefit, do our churches fitly sing with
the Prophet, Blessed be the Lord which has not given us for a pray unto their
teeth. Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the foulers: the
snare is broken, and we are delivered. Our help is the name of the Lord, etc.
Psalm. 124.

[Wherefore in my judgment they speak preposterously, who ask whether the
church be in the papacy: And these clauses also.
because on the contrary it should be asked, whether the papacy be in the
church. For the subject is not in the accident, but the accident in the
subject, whose being is an in-being, or to be in a thing, as men commonly
speak. And that] the papacy is in the church, as the order or estate of
apostasy in the house and city of God, [is as certain, as that of the Apostle
is certain,] 2 These. 2. that the man of sin, the son of perdition sits
in the temple of God, with his whole order or Or, rank, in the former
translation.
estate of apostates: and not [on the other side, that] the temple of God
consists in that order and number of apostates, which is a thing most
strange and furthest off. But the term of the papacy taken doubly and
aequivocally, deceives them in such sort, as here before we showed concerning
the Roman popish church. For under the name of the papacy (which is an order
vicious and corrupt) they comprehend the subject it self, which is annoyed with
that corruption, not distinguishing aright between these things.]

[As therefore, if any should deny that to be a body,] which lies in a deadly
sort swollen with the water of the dropsy, And this.
[or should affirm that water which choketh the body, to be the body it self,
should in both these be deceived in his judgment: so also are both deceived, as
well they which deny it to be the church, because the papacy is in it, as they
which avouch the papacy to be the church it self, which we have before
disproved.] The papacy is a poison in the church, which poison must needs be
vomited out, if it will be preserved: or else the church will be extinguished by
it, if it suffer that poison to prevail, and possess all the veins of the
body.

[But how can she be the church, (will some say in which the papacy is? Even
so as there is the body, And this.
in which a disease works. But because the papacy is a deadly corruption,
the more that the papacy gets strength, the more the church is weakened: the
increase of the one, is the decrease of the other. And hence it comes to
pass, that in the churches which are called popish, some are more healthie,
and some more unhealthie then others: the more healthie are those which have
less of the papacy, and more of the church: and those are the more unhealthie
which have more of the papacy, and less of the church: and of this kind, I
doubt not that church to be, which at this day is at Rome.] For it had long
ago given up the ghost, if God by the medicine of his grace and long suffering
had not nourished and kept it warm.

[Notwithstanding that we may give content unto their minds, which do not yet
reach unto these things, And this.
or think that they are more subtily then truly spoken of the church which they
call the papal or popish church: let us answer this question in few words, from
the regard of al particular churches, as they are among me^, or in
consideration of things humane. Every church, which in deed is a church, is
considered two ways, on Gods behalf (as they speak) and on our behalf.] On
Gods behalf, it is altogether a church, whersoever there is found a company
called of God, with his calling by the spirit and the holy Scripture, and the
ministry of persons ordained for holy things and divine actions. [On our
behalf, there is no church at al, (although it be so of God, And this also.
as we have said) to which there does not cleave corruption, concerning the
persons, things, actions, and finally the whole ministration of man ordained by
God. Now that which is on Gods part, is not taken away by our default, so long
as it seems good unto the Lord, to acknovvledge it for his church, and call
it by his calling, by the spirit, and holy Scripture, and the ministry. For
shall the unbeleef of men, (says the Apostle Romans 3, 3.) make the faith of God
without effect? shall the weakness of man make void the truth of God? or his
imperfection the perfection of God? Far be it off: yea let God be true and
every man a liar, says the Apostle in the same place.]

We will make the matter plain by an example and similitude out of the words of
Jeremy, chapter 3. A wife being filthy with adulteries, if her husband will
pardon her, and consent to receive her, And these clauses he passes over.
and to dwell with her, she abides still the wife of her husband, [not in deed
by her own fact (for she has broken wedlock, what in her was) but by the
benefit or goodness of her husband.] So a church overflowing not only with
lighter infirmities, but also with grievous adulteries, [should cease in deed
on her part to be a wife, but she cease not on her husbands part.] For
touching the election, as the Apostle says, Romans 11, 28. she is beloved for
the fathers sakes, speaking of the church of the Jews. [It is a church so long
whiles God calling her, proclaymeth that which is in Ier. 3, 13. Only
acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou have transgressed against the Lord thy
God, And these following.
and have scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye
have not obeyed my voice, says the Lord. Turn, O backslyding people, says the
Lord, for I am married unto you, and I will receive you etc. It is a church so
long, whiles God with protestation calls upon it departing from him and being
rebellious, as it is in Esa 50, 1. Where is the bil of your mothers
divorcement, wherewith I put her away? or who is there of my creditors to whom
I sold you? etc. The church then at length cease to be a church, when God
cease to call it back, and takes away the evidence of that holy marriage,
that is, the holy Scripture, out of the hand of the adulteres, and her that is
stubburne, testifying that the matrimony is dissolved on his part, and so
receives the covenant of grace to himself. It is not for any man, to deny that
to be a church, which God calls a church. Neither is it for any man, to call
that a church, which God, having given the bil of divorce, and taken away the
draught of the marriage contract, denies so to be.]

And after this manner do we esteem of the church in which the papacy is. God
calls her with his calling, by his spirit, and word, and the public records
of that holy marriage (which we call the holy Scripture) and the ministry, and
holy things, and actions, And this also.
which before we have briefly reckoned up. [These things do remain to that
church most manifestly, on Gods behalf. But in that on the behalf of men al
these holy things and actions, together with the very persons themselves,
abound and overflow, with most grievous and deadly corruptions, this is the
sin of men, not the fault of God, whose grace and truth is perfected in
infirmity On Gods part, she is yet called Hammi, my people, and Ruchama,
finding mercy, which most truly on her part, may be called Lo hammi, not my
people, and Lo ruchama, not obteyning mercy, as we read in Hoseah the Prophet.
But we rely upon the mercy of God, and according to his grace revealed, we
speak our mind, or deliver our sentence concerning a church erring and going
astray.]

[But this church has every thing in it corrupt. I co^fes it. But] in that it
has all the divine things in the Scriptures, it is of God: in that it has the^
al corrupt, that is of it self; And this.
in that it has all the divine things, it is a church, in that it has the same
al corrupt, it is a corrupt church. The church is not taken away by corruption,
unles it be total (as they speak) which they call destruction. And this
[A corruption that is in part does not take away a church, but weke^ it. The
church of Rome has al things corrupt, but not altogether: this is not a
destruction, but is to be called a corruption of it in part.]

[For to prosecute these heads particularly, which we have briefly noted in the
consideration of the church God by the alone presence of himself calling, does
lay the foundation of the church, And this whole passage he omitteth.
in Christ the head thereof. The church of Rome adds another foundation to
this foundation, and to this head another new head (whereupon it is called papal
or popish) wherein it may likewise rest with all. The calling is to God alone, in
the church of Rome there is calling to others with God, and the calling upon
the^. There the calling is by the spirit and Scripture alone, whence it
receives the ministry, and delivers nothing more, then that which it has
received from the Lord: here it receives a ministry from the spirit of
Christ, and of the Pope, from the Scripture, and the ragged traditions of men:
there finally the persons, things and actions are carried, according to the
doctrine of the spirit, and the Scripture only: here all things are taken and
exercised out of the Popes changeable shop, and at his beck (as they say) they
stand and fall. So all the marks on Gods behalf are in it: but for it self, on
it own part (as they say) there is no mark entire, no mark that is not corrupt
by the papal poysonfull sorcerie, and the order of all things most miserably
perverted. For which cause in Lions in France, a certain Friar did merrily
preach to the people, when he said the Hugonots (for so they are called in
France) did consent with the church of Rome in all their articles of says, but
there was one shrewd word, the word [Onely,] at the crack whereof war was in
^indled, for they believe only what the rule of faith has out of the holy
Scriptures: but the church of Rome requires more unto faith then is either
contained in the rule of faith, or in the holy Scriptures, because such is the
authority of the church.]

And this also.
[These things being well understood, all men will easily perceive how that
Church, in respect of God or on Gods part, is yet a church: but of it self is
most corrupt, and very near to destruction. But here do arise two doubts and
difficulties, by which the minds of many are troubled. The first doubt is, what
we are to judge of the members of that church: The latter what the duty of
them is who are in that church, and see the great corruptions thereof.]

[To the first question we answer on this manner, A threefold judgment had need
meet together in this cause: And this.
the first, of truth: the second, of charity: the third of prudence or
wisdom. The judgment of truth is of the common condition of the church, by
which we judge from the calling of God, that as yet she is a church. The
judgment of charity is of the several members of the church, by which we
presume they be members of the church, whiles they be called with the calling
from God, and are in this way, as David calls it Psalm. 2. The judgment of
prudence or wisdom, is that by which we discern and distinguish persons,
things and actions, divine from humane, good ones from evil, true ones from
false, and the degrees of these also amongst themselves. For as of things and
actions, so also of persons some are corrupting through ignorance infirmity,
or malice wholly, or in part others are corrupted, even in the simplicity of
their hearts as the Scripture speaks: and of these there are a great number,
of whom it were ungodly to esteem that they were not of the church of God. Of
such as do corrupt we must take heed, Mat. 7. of the corrupted, who are
corrupted yet still, we must have compassion. But the Church verily is not to
be judged of the manner of either of these: for Christ says not, ye shall not
know the church; but, by their fruits, of doctrine and life, ye shall know
them, Mat. 7, 20. And without doubt, they do very unwisely who judge of the
truth of a church, by the particular life or doctrine of any men, who ever
they be, especially of private men: for the calling of God makes the church,
not the assenting answer of the men that are in it: as on the other side the
Church cease not to be a church for the refusal, or denial of men,
wheresoever the calling of God is. Now let us come to the second demand.]

What is the duty of those (will thou say that are in the popish church, and
see the grievous corruptions of it? And some clauses here
Their duty is such as of those children, which dwell together with their
adulterous mother: [for God has used this similitude in Esaias and Jeremy, as
we have seen before] A wise son will even from his heart abhor the sin
of his mother, he will with speech and sign call back his mother from evil,
and he will abstain himself from it: and in all things he will cleave to his
father, [he will stand to his judgment, he will obey his will: and while he can
by reason of his mother, he will cleave unto her, next after his father: but
when and whiles by reason of her he can not do it with good conscience, for
the spiritual and bodily injury of her,] he will betake himself into the
chamber of his father, Closet, or inner room.
[where also is the church the mother of us all. Gal. 4, 26. For this is not a
good consequent, if one depart from this or that church, therefore he does
altogether depart from the church. He does but trifle that does so from a
particular, conclude universally. A part of the flesh if it be divided or cut
asunder from another part by a wound received, is not straight way to be
thought to be separate or cut of from the whole body: for it is cut asunder,
and the mouth of the vvound opens, but neither part is therefore disjoined
from the body. A godly son therefore ought to cleave to his father and
mother jointly, so long as with good conscience he can: but because he cannot
with sound faith and conscience have fellowship with the unfruitful works of
darkness, Ephesians. 5, 11. he rather leaving his mother, cleaves to God his father,
and our Lord Jesus Christ, then that he will defile himself with those foul
deeds of his mother.]

And these passages following to the end,
[And this did our ancestors religiously, whom the popish tyranny for some
ages has exercised. The godly which were at Rome, and other where in the
Church which they call the Roman church abusiuely, first learned to abhor
even from their soul, the sins of their mother, when once they began to have
right understanding; by words and signs they modestly called her back from her
naughty deeds, whiles she would bear them, they carefully absteyned
themselves from all communion of evil, yet in all things cleaving to their
father, from whom, in whom, by whom, and for whom are all things, standing to
his judgment, and obeying his will: finally they did so long cleave to their
mother next after their father, whilst by her they could so do with entire
faith and conscience, and their own salvation. But when they could not longer
with good faith and conscience so do, by reason of the violent tyranny, and
the spiritual and corporal injury of their furious mother, then being
ashamed of her shamefulnes, and resting silent, they betook themselves into
their fathers bosom and his inner room, albeit that she pursued them
outragiously: least they being ashamed of her, should be said to shame her, as
stumpets are usually wont to do.]

[For which causes, I do humbly beseech God the Father of our Lord Jesus,
that he would both by his saving calling inform, direct and care for his
church, and whatsoever belongs to his church, and that he would also teach
every one that is in it his truth, and the truth of his church: and that he
would so work, as they wisely absteyning from all evils, especially from those
which the son of perdition, and author of the apostasy has brought in, and
taking heed of the spirit of lies, and the efficacy of his error, they may
religiously cleave unto the Father and his good things, in every of them, and
to their mother next after the father (or so far as she accords with the
Father:) that increasing in his truth, piety, says and love they may bestow
and employ al their studies to the edification of the church, the salvation of
all, and the glory of that our heavenly Father. etc.

God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, by that eternal spirit of his
eternal truth, bring to pass, that the wiles of Satan being driven away, we
may al grow daily in Christ, in the church, and in the truth of Christ and the
Church, and that we may more and more confirm one another in love unfayned, to
his glory and the common salvation of us all. Amen.

Hitherto M. Iunius: who though he be dead, yet lives and speaks sufficient
in this writing, for the point in hand. Which vvhiles M. Ainsw. would seem to
answer, it is strange (but good to be observed) how many things of weight he
passes over; besides that sometimes he picketh out a sentence here, and a
sentence there, and leaves out what comes between; which should help the
Reader, and more clear the matter: thus being injurious herein both to the
living and the dead: not to speak of the unspeakable abuse of Scripture also,
into which he falls still more and more: which the Reader shall do well to
observe, though I insist not upon the particulars, which would be endless: and
being now purposed here only to note a fevve things more, which he has, that
are merely Anabaptisticall, and full of glosing deceit.

21. Speaking of the Church of Rome, whereas he should distinguish betvveen
the Temple of God, and Man of sin, spoken off 2 These. 2, 4. Animadv. p.
98-102. etc.
he either regards not to observe it; or confounds them together as one,
without distinction; or so speaks of Gods Temple and church there, as if it
were no other then the Devils, spoken off Rev. 18, 2, 3. and 16, 14. then
Sodom, Egypt and Babylon, Rev. 11, 8. and 16, 19. the lothed of God, delivered
to Satan, to be seduced, deluded, damned, 2 These. 4, 8.9, 11, 12. And how
then is there the people of God, the Temple of God, the baptism of God, the
covenant of God, the salvation of God to any in that Church, etc. Betvveene
these things, there is no just proportion: for what concord has Christ with
Beliall, or the Temple of God with idols or devils? 2 Cor. 6, 15, 16.

22. Speaking of the congregation of Saints that was at Rome in Paul's time (he
says not, as he might, that it is since corrupted, adulterate, or fallen into
defection, etc. but) he says absolutely, it is gone long since, and the man of
sin with his worshippers come in the place. Page 98.
So then here again let him tell us, whether he thinks these be the Temple
of God, the people of God, under the covenant of God, having the baptism of
God, which the Lord has ordained and given to his Church; or whether there be
no such there at all, though corrupted and abused, etc.

23. Whereas See here before, pa. 183.
M. Iunius spoke of Gods church, being even at Rome at this day, by the mercy
of God, because he trusted, that [there is God calling; persons called; and the
calling it self yet in her: the meeting of which things together in one gives
being to a church, etc.] M. Ains. not having what to answer hereunto,
Animadv. p. 98, 99,
does very boldly, and without limitation or restreynt, deny that God is there
calling as in his church, but that the man of sin sits there as God, calling
all to worship him, and that his calling is by the working of Satan, and in all
deceiueablenes of unrighteousnes among them that perish; 2 These. 2, 9, 10, 11.
All which together (says he) gives being to Antichrists church, but not to
Christ's. Animadv. p. 98, 99. Thus (after his manner) still he terms that
Antichrists church, which the Apostle calls the Temple of God. But omitting
this, if it be as here he says, how then has there ben or can there be
salvation to any in that church, since the man of sin sat there: which
himself thinks was sone after Paul's time. Page 84. How also should any of
that church become Martyrs, and vvitnesses of the Christian faith, against the
professed enemies thereof? And how should any Jews or Pagans be converted to
the faith of Christ, by any of them? Or does he think, that no such thing is
had or done at all by them?

Besides, if now an Anabaptist take up M. Ains. own words, and where he
speaks of calling, apply it to baptism had in the church of Rome, saying
thus as M. Ains. does here, I deny that God is there baptizing as in his
church, but the Man of sin sits there as God, baptising all that worship him,
and his baptising is by the vvorking of Satan, and in all deceiueablenes of
unrighteousnes among them that perish; and the persons baptized, are deluded to
believe lies. 2 These. 2, 9, 10, 11. All which together, give being to
Antichrists baptism, but not to Christ's: what now will M. Ainsvv. answer
hereunto, but that either he shall contradict himself, or fall into more error
hereabout, to the further hardening of the Anabaptists in their erroneous
opinions and courses.

Page 99.
24. That which M. Iunius applies (and fitly) to the popish Hierarchy: M.
Ainsvv. applies to the church of Rome, and the whole church there: Yea though
himself afterward acknowledge, that the popish ecclesiastical hierarchy
consists of Bishops, Priests, and ministers, page 100. besides whom, there
are the people: as himself also notes in the other page aforesaid. Page 99.

25. When See here before, p. 183.
M. Iunius (for more clearing of the point) purposely distinguished between the
papacy, and the Church: shevving the difference between them, both in their
general kind, and in their peculiar difference: namely that the papacy is an
order or estate, humane and evil: the church a company or assembly, Animadv.
p. 99, etc.
divine, and by authority of God knit together: etc. M. Ains. finding no
answer hereunto, purposely passes over diverse words, clauses, sentences, and
whole passages, which would give light to the matter in hand: and not content
herewith, makes much a do about a word ( a rank of apostates) urging it
contrary to M. Iunius his meaning, how ever it be understood. For first,
although the Translator in this place used two words (an order or rank of
apostates) yet he might see M. Iunius his word was but one, signifying an order
or an estate of apostates, as before he spoke of an order or estate of
apostasy. Which word also the Translator here kept and joined with the other.
But now this word of an order or estate, so fitly opening the point in
question, and not leaving such color of exception or aequivocation, as M.
Ains. seeks after: he leaves it, and takes hold on the other. A slight and
silly course. But (as himself said erevvhile) what will not men do, for help
in time of need?

As for the word (rank) it also is used in our tongue, for an order, estate,
condition, estimation, etc. As in Psa. 53, 13. where David speaking of
Achitophel, or the like, says, But it was thou, a man according to my rank,
as the new Translators have it in the margent: for which they have in the text,
a man, mine equal; and M. Ainsw. In Psalm. 55, 14.
in his translation and notes, O man esteemed of as my self, or according to my
order, or estimation, etc. where now observe these things, for the more
clearing of this matter: 1. That the whole church or common weal of Israel,
Priests and people, were not of the same order, rank, or estate, whereof
David and Achitophel were. 2. That the order or rank there spoken of, was to
be distinguished from the persons themselves otherwise considered. Both which
M. Iunius observes here, and M. Ainsvv. confounds or perverteth what he can.
3. That where the other Translators use the word rank, M. Ainsw. uses the
word order: clean contrary to his dealing here, where he leaves the word
order or estate used both by the author and Translator, and lays hold on the
word rank. And why so? That let M. Ains. tell us himself: unless we should
think that he did it, because the word rank in our tongue, does sometimes
also signify that which is or grows thick together, as corn in a field,
or the like; and so is applied to persons or things in this behalf. So as thus
a rank of apostates may be understood of a company of apostates, and those
also thick together: whereas M. Iunius, about this question, puts
difference purposely betvveen an order or rank, and betvveene a company or
assembly: making the one the general of apostasy, and the other the general
of a church: and so shevving that the apostasy, and church of Rome, are two
different things, and diversely to be considered.

Which vvhiles M. Ainsvv. will not regard as he should, but consound or abuse,
what he can: let others judge what vain a do he makes hereabout, and how ill
in this behalf he deals with M. Iunius. And this the more, seeing that also
See it here before, p. 184
in the very next sentence to one of them which M. Ainsvv. here cites, M.
Iunius himself showed the fountain and occasion of this deceit, how ever M.
Ain. (after his manner) passes over it: namely, that the term of the papacy
taken doubly and aequivocally deceives men in such sort (says he) as here
before we showed touching the Roman popish church. For under the term of the
papacy (which is a vicious corrupt order) they comprehend the subject it self,
which is annoyed with that corruption, not distinguishing aright between
these things, etc. Which how true it is found in M. Ain. not only in this
passage, but throughout his treatise, is so evident as I need not stand further
to show it. Every page, yea almost every sentence, is a witness and
demonstration thereof.

Or if in this place, by an order or rank of apostates, we understand also a
company of apostates (as in the next clause follovving there is a word of
number, that may be taken to imply so much:) yet any may perceive that M.
Iunius here speaks this, not of the whole church, as M. Ains. urges it; but
only of the papal ecclesiastical hierarchy, as Page 183 etc.
othervvhere in this treatise he calls it. Which is evident by the very
words themselves, which are these: Page 183 etc.
And that the papacy is in the church, as the order or estate of apostasy in
the house and city of God, is as certain, as that of the Apostle is certain, 2
These. 2 that the man of sin, the son of perdition sits in the Temple of
God, with his whole order A^ the other translation had it.
or rank of apostates: and not on the other side, that the Temple of God
consists in that order and number of apostates, which is a thing most strange
and furthest off. Where mark two things, for clearing the point in hand:
First, that M. Iunius expressly distinguishes between the Church or Temple of
God it self, and betvveene the man of sin that sits therein, with his
whole order or estate of apostates: Secondly, that here, by this order or rank
of apostates (spoken off) he understands only the popish hierarchy
aforesaid, and not the whole church or Temple of God it self: which he says
were most strange and is furthest off. Now though he speak thus plainly and
expressly, yet M. Ain. will not regard it as he should, but takes and urges
it so, as he hears M. Iunius himself say, is most strange and furthest off:
whether from the truth it self, Advert. p 60 -- 65. and here, p. 171. etc.
or from the Apostles meaning; and so also from his own; it comes to a like
end for the point in hand.

Yea and moreover, if this phrase of a rank of apostates, be applied (as by M.
Ains. it is) to the whole church, Priests and people: yet we must still remember
the diverse consideration of churches, 1 Kin. 13 28, 30, etc Hos. 5, 1, 2 etc.
and of their estate in this behalf: as both M. Iunius Se before p. 185. etc
in this treatise observes, and we have also noted * before. If we look upon
Israel, either on the ten tribes, or on Judah also, when the Kings and
Princes, Priests and people, were fallen into apostasy, forsaking the Lord, 2
Chr. 33, 2, 9, 10. ^er 1, 16.18. and 5, 30, 31. and 7, 17, 18. and 44, 15, 16,
17. etc.
and burning incense to other Gods, etc. will not M. Ains. say of them (as
here he does, of the church of Rome) that now the whole church of Israel and
Judah, Priests and people, were a rank of apostates. But will he therefore
conclude thereupon (as here he does) that they were not then (in other
consideration) the Church of God, the Temple of God, the people of God, that
they had not true circumcision, nor the covenant of God, etc. yet thus he
concludes about the Church of Rome.

26. Likewise when M. Iunius accounts the papal hierarchy as an accident
grown upon the church, Animadv. p. 99. 100.
M. Ains. mentions the word (accident) as being desirous to take hold
thereon, but medleth not with M. Iunius his reasons, being not able to give
answer unto them. That the papacy (says M. Iunius) Se before p. 183.
is an accident grown upon the church, experience it self shows. For the
subject is before his accident, which is contingent and separable. The Church
was many ages, when the papacy was not: The papacy came to the church
contingently (beside the being of the Church) and so may be separated from it:
as at this time also there are Churches, where the papacy is not; and there
will be churches still hereafter without the papacy. etc. Now what one word of
answer has M. Ains. hereunto? In this (as in other things) he is as mute as a
fish: though all may see, that these are the things that should have been
insisted upon, if he could have found any answer.

27. He trifleth also and cavileth about the similitudes of a poison, Animadv.
p. 99, 100.
a gangrene, and an ulcer in the body, whereunto M. Iunius compares the popish
hierarchy in the church. Neither does he keep to the point, wherein M. Iunius
compares them together: but either makes other applications of his own, or
seeks out some differences between the^, in other respects, etc. As if
similitudes should hold in all things: Whereas he should have showed (if he
could) that they do not agree in that, wherein M. Iunius compares them
together: As first, that these diseases and evils are not the body it self, but
differing from it, and yet in it. Secondly, that they are noisome and prove
deadly in the end to the body, if there be not help and remedy had against
them. Besides that M. Ainsw. himself compares them here, to the Egyptian
boyles, and to the Image which Nebuchadnezar saw, of gold, silver, brass, iron
and clay. Yet I suppose he will put a difference betvveen the boyles, and the
Egyptians themselves: neither thinks the persons spoken of to be without all
natural life, nor able to perform any action either good or bad, as was the
case of that image it self. The Prophets compare the apostate Jews (as here
he does the apostate Christians) to brass and iron, etc. Ier. 6, 28. Ezec. 22,
18. Shall we now thereupon conclude against Judah, as he does against the
church of Rome, to make in deed a very nullitie of all their actions,
ministration, and Churches estate? The Scripture compares the wicked to dust,
myer, hay, smoke, stubble, tares, melting wax, etc. Psalm. 1, 4. and 18, 43. and
37, 2, 20. and 68, 3. and 83, 14. Mat. 13.38. and the godly to trees, corn,
seed, the mountains of Sion. etc. Psalm. 1, 3. and 125, 1. Mat. 3, 12. and 13,
38. and Christ's coming at that day, to a thieues coming in the night, etc.
Matthew. 24, 43, 44. 1 These. 5, 2. Rev. 16, 15. Were it not now an easy (but a
vain) thing for this man, being not able to except against these similitudes,
for the things wherein they are compared together, yet to set him self to
cavil there against, whether framing other applications of his own, or
showing some differences in other respects, etc.

28. But it is specially to be observed, that he says, If the papacy, Ibid.
or papal hierarchy ecclesiastical (be not the church: so speaks M.
Iunius: for which M. Ains. has) if it be no part of the body of the Church,
but Se before p. 183.
an evil grown up in the church, an accident, a poison, a gangrene, an
ulcer, covertly vvorking against the life and health of it, and daungerously
eating up the lively and wholesome moisture of the church: what shall we think
of all the actions of that ecclesiastical hierarchy, their ministration of
sacraments, their making of ministers, and the whole church administration, by
that rank of apostates; they cannot possibly be the actions of the body, of the
church, neither of Christ. Can a scab or gangrene perform any action of a
natural body or member? And now what is become of their true baptism, and
ordination of ministers before pleaded for? these will be but as the operation
of the poison or fretting of the gangrene; for they that did them, being the
popish ecclesiastical hierarchy, were (not the church, for which M. Ains.
has) no parts of the church, but accidents, as the gangrene, or pocks upon the
whores body, which consume life and grace, but give none at all. Could any
Anabaptist write more Anabaptistically then thus? Or can a man hold these
opinions, and yet not become an Anabaptist, if he walk conscionably? If the
baptism had in the church of Rome, be not true baptism, yea if it be but as
the operation of poison, or fretting of the gangrene, etc. ought not al men by all means to renounce and reject it? Or will any man of any godliness or
conscience still retein it? Have your selves (O ye Anabaptists) ever said more
concerning the baptism aforesaid, then this man has done? Yea would you not
be ashamed before God and men, to hold and speak thereof as he does, and yet
still to reteyne it?

Ibid.
29. But it is just with God thus to confound him, who as he began with
notorious error and blasphemy, so still proceeds in like manner. Here
before, at first he said, the baptism had in the church of Rome, is a false
sacrament, and lying sign, not true baptism, but an idol, a fiction, a false
baptism, an accursed and detestable sacrament; not the sign and seal of Gods
covenant, but Babylons baptism, such as were the sacrifices and sacraments of
Babylon, and the other heathens, etc. Animad. p. 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, etc. His
proceeding also is in like sort: page 95, 96. And now dravving to an end, he
says again, that it is not true baptism, but as the operation of poison, or
fretting of the gangrene, etc. page 100. How much better had it ben for him to
lay his hand on his mouth, and with humblenes to learn to put difference
betvveen the church it self, and the apostasy thereof; betvveen Gods
ordinances themselves, and Antichrists corruptions commingled withal: then thus
to tread in Nebuchadnezars steps, who burnt the Temple of God, when the
apostate Jews had polluted it: which the Lord notvvithstanding still esteemed
to be his, and therefore took on him the vengeance of his Temple. 2 Chronicles. 36,
14, etc. Ezech. 8, etc. with Jer. 50, 28. and 51, 11. The same God still lives
for ever: let this man therefore fear before him: how ever he regard not (as
he should) what he speaks before men: specially if he can carry it away with
any pretense or applause.

Ibid.
30. And what pretense has he here to bear him out in this matter? Can a scab
or gangrene (says he) perform any action of a natural body or member? But if
M. Iunius lived to return him answer, he would keep him to the point in hand,
and soon ask of him again, Can a body that has a scab or gangrene perform no
actions of a natural body? And what can M. Ainsw. answer hereunto, but it
will be against himself, what ever pretense or color he set upon it?

31. Besides if Hymenaeus and Philetus, spoken off by the Apostle, were
Ministers (though haereticall, schismatic, apostaticall, etc.) who teaching
errors, their word did eat as a cancker or gangrene: 2 Timothy 2, 17, 18. would
M. Ains. therefore conclude (as here he does) that the baptism ministered by
them was not true baptism, but as the fretting of the gangrene, Ibid.
etc. How then said he before, * that he was far from Cyprians error, who
held that it is not baptism that is ministered by heretics or schismatics;
Animad. p. 71.
and that it is to be renounced and rejected, and accounted as profane.
Cyprian. Epist. 70, 71, 72. etc. Or would he, that men should not have true
baptism? or that they should still reteyne the fretting of a gangrene? etc. Or
what vvil he say, if he do not distinguish betvveen their doctrine of error,
and their other actions, estate and ministry, otherwise considered?
Likewise when the apostate Jews are by the Prophets compared to brass,
iron, lead, tin, dross, reffuse, and ofscouring, etc. Jer. 6, 28, 29, 30.
Lament. 3, 45. Eze. 22, 18, 19, 20. which cannot do the actions of the body
of a man: will he therefore say, that the circumcision had in Judah, was not
true circumcision, and that no actions of the Priests or administration of that
church, could possibly be the actions of the body, of the Church, neither of
Christ: how ever they were considered, and difference put betvveen the church
it self and Gods ordinances on the one hand, and their own corruptions and
apostasy on the other?

32. But why speaks he not also of the similitude of the plague or pestilence,
used likewise by M. Iunius? does he perceive, Ibid.
that the papacy may well be accounted the plague of that church, and yet be
distiinguished from the church it self: even as iniquity every where is
justly esteemed the plague of churches, cities, kingdoms, and commonweals,
and yet is distinguished from them notvvithstanding?

33. And why passes he over M. Iunius his other similitudes of the Dropsy,
and Consumption? Has he no shift or color there against? Ibid.
Does he see it to be undeniable, that these are accidents of the body, and not
the body it self: and that therefore difference is to be put betvveene these
diseases themselves, and betvveen the bodies affected therevvith? Why then
does he not likewise discern it in the other? And why does he not yield
thereunto? Is it because he closes up his eyes, least he should see, and
hardens his heart, least he should understand? So in deed have many done,
both teachers and people, even in Israel heretofore, and that also from time
to time: Whom the Lord therefore punished accordingly, blynding their eyes, and
making their heart fat, and ears heavy: least they should see with their
eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and
convert and be healed. Esa. 6, 9, 10. with Matthew. 13, 13, 14, 15. and Act, 28,
25, 26, 27.

34. Where he again denies any calling to be in the church of Rome, Animadv.
p. 100.
I have disproved it here before, page 188. And where he asks how God does
call in that church of Rome: Let him ask it of such of his followers, as have
heretofore ben of the Priests and members of that church, how they were
called; and that so as they left that estate: whether it was by immediate
revelation from heaven, or by some means here on earth; and whether it was by
the word of God, or without it? Let him tell us, whence the Protestants and
Churches reformed of late, did come: whether from the church of Rome, or no:
and how they were first called there? Yea let him tell us, where and how
himself and his other followers (younger then the former) had their calling?
If he say, in the Church of England, or by any of the Ministers or Members
there: let him remember how he esteems of that church, and of the hierarchy
there retained: yea that he accounts that Church also, not to be the church
of God, but to be Babylon, without the covenant of God, not having true
baptism, nor any part of Christ's ministry at all, yea nor Christ himself for
their Mediator, etc. But to let these alone: let him tell us, whether he
think that God called any by those Prophets and Angels, that are spoken off,
Rev. 11, 3. etc. and 14, 6, 8, 9. or by the Prophets and Saints, spoken off,
Rev. 18, 24. also who be the people of God, and by whom they are called out
of Babylon, that are spoken off, Rev. 18, 4. and whether none of them were of
the church of Rome, and in the Ministry, yea and in the hierarchy thereof,
when God did call them, Here note the case also of Gregory the great bishop
of the church of Rome it self, whom M. Brightman thinks to be the Angel spoken
off, Rev. 8, 13.
or others by them, etc. Finally, let him tell us what he thinks (in this
behalf) of Robert Grosted, Bishop of Lincoln, about the year 1293. of
Archbishop Cranmer, and Bishop Ridley, of late years: of John Wicklesse, who
lived and dyed Parson of Lutterworth in Leycester shier, about the year 1400.
and many others in England and Scotland. Also of John Husse, and Jerome of
Prage, in Bohemia; Of Franciscus Petrarcha, Ioannes de rupe scissa; Conradus
Hager, Martin Luther, and others in Germany: Of Waldus, Gulielmus de sancto
amore, Farell, and others in France: Of Arnoldus de villa nova, Diazius, and
others in Spain: Of Jerome Savanarola, a Monk; and Silvester, a Friar, with
others in Italy. For all which and exceeding many more, see their histories in
the Acts and Monuments of the Martyrs.

Ibid.
35. Note also, that these men do not acknowldge the church of Rome, (in any of
the considerations or respects shevved by M. Iunius) to be the body of Christ,
Yet for the terms them selves, even particular persons, and these other also
may thus be called, being rightly understood.
the house and Temple of God: no, though the Apostle himself say, as M. Iunius
alleges, that the man of sin sits in the Temple of God: 2 These. 2, 4 and
yet they acknovvledge that Christian people, men or women, being joined in
covenant, and having no ministers or Officers, (one or other, better or worse)
are called in the Scriptures, the body of Christ, the house, city, and kingdom
of God, that may also receive in, and cast out of the church: and (as some say)
may minister both Sacraments and Censures, etc. though yet they show not in the
Scriptures, where a people without Officers are so termed, and did so walk.
The differences that are among themselves and others hereabout, I stand not
upon: vvhiles one says and admits one thing, and others another. That
which most now I look unto, is the grounds held generally among the^, and the
assertions of some more particularly; together also with this man's pleading in
some things thereabout. Anim. p. 24, 25, 26. etc. and 45, 46, 47, etc. and that
yet they yield not this to churches in apostasy, having officers.

36. Where M. Iunius purposely sets himself, to satisfy the demand of such
as See before p. 184, 185.
ask, [hovv it can be the church wherein the papacy is:] and shows [a
double consideration of all particular churches, as they are among men: the one
on Gods behalf, the other on ours: etc.] M. Ains. (besides that Animad, p. 100,
101
he passes by exceeding many things of special moment) coming to speak of the
one of the said considerations, he does not so much as mention the other:
Neither this only, but omitting both it, and the further declaration of them
both; lays hold on a sentence that comes a good while after (without due
regard of the other betvveen) and then reasons thereabout, as he thinks to
be best. Where, still the Reader may observe, that al his exceptions arise
partly on this that he regards not the several respects or considerations
noted by M. Iunius, partly because he confounds as all one the Man of sin,
and the Temple of God, also the Beast, and the Church, etc. Now touching the
ministry here spoken off, what difference M. Iunius observed betvveen the
Ministry simply considered, and the hierarchy grown in that Church upon it,
himself could best have showed. This particular here is evident, that in one
respect he acknowledges the hierarchy to be [an order or estate of apostasy
in the church, an accident or evil grown up therein, as the dropsy,
consumption, or gangren in the body:] in another respect he esteems the
ministry of Gods holy things to be there: (though exceedingly corrupted.) As
for example, be it that he meant of the ministry of Baptism, etc. Which let
this opposite now ponder again, and see, whether he must not come either thus
to consider with distinction thereabout, or become an Anabaptist.

37. Where he denies again Gods calling to be in that church: Animad. p. 101.
I have handled it here before, p. 188. and 193. etc. Yet seeing he urges it
so often, let us bring his reasons here to the trial. He alleges, that Paul
says, God will send them that perish, strong delusion, that they shall believe
lies, 2 These. 2, 10, 11. Therefore (says M. Ains.) God calls not the church
of Rome, by his spirit and word: nor any in that church, or by any of them in
that estate. (For so also he must conclude, for the point in hand.) Now what
a consequent is this? Might he not also thus conclude against Judah in
apostasy: that God did not call that church, nor any in it, or by any of them
in that estate: alledgeing vvithall, Ier. 5, 30, 31. and 6, 28, 29, 30. Ezech.
13, and 14 chap.

38. Again he alleges that the Apostle says, Strong is the Lord God which
will condemn Babylon, Rev. 18, 8. and with the spirit of his mouth will
consume that lawless one, 2 These. 2, 8. Therefore (says M. Ain.) God calls
not the church of Rome with his spirit: nor any in it, or by any of them in
that estate: which he affirmed here also before. Animad. p. 98, 99, 100. As if
there were no difference to be put betvveen the Temple of God, and that
lawless one, 2 These. 2, 4.8. nor betvveen the people of God, and Babylon, Rev.
18, 4, 8. Or as if Gods work were all one, concerning the one, and the other.

39. And (says he) whereas they call the Scripture the public record of that
holy marriage between God and her: the Scripture shows no such marriage, Ibid.
but does defy her as an harlot: Rev. 17, 1. Where is the record (says he
again) that Christ was ever married to the Beast that came up from the
bottomless pit? Rev. 17, 8. I answer, The Scripture shows record of the
marriage of that church, the church of Rome. Romans 1, 7, 8. and 7, 4. and 16, 19.
And himself did acknowledge it before, more then once ( page 84, and 98.) how
ever he do now call for declaration of it. Neither is it any thing that he
says, God does defy her as an harlot, Rev. 17, 1. For (besides that he puts
no difference between Babylon, and the church or Temple of God) what will he
say to Israel, yea to Judah also and Jerusalem, in this behalf? Thinks he not,
that God also defied the^ as harlots, Jer. 3, 8, 11. with Esa. 1, 21. and 57,
etc. Hos. 2, 2 -- 5. and Ezec. 16, 2, 3, 4 -- 35, etc. and 23, 2 -- 45. will he
therefore say, that the Scripture shows no record of their marriage with God?
What then says he to Exodus 19, 4, 5, 6. and Ezech. 16, 8. (which places
himself here before alleged, for a covenant with all the earth, p. 97.) what
also to Esa. 50, 1. Ier. 3, 1. Ezech. 23, 4. But it exceeds all, that he
blusheth not to ask, Where is the record that Christ was ever married to the
beast that came up from the bottomless pit? Rev. 17, 8. To the Beast! That
Christ was ever married to the Beast! Did M. Iunius ever say so? Or thinks he,
that ever it entered into his thought? Did not M. Iunius speak expressly of the
Church? Will this man never learn to put difference between the Beast and the
Church? betvveen the Man of sin and the Temple of God? Is it not
unsufferable, that he should thus abuse not only M. Iunius and our selves and
his Readers all, but even the Scripture it self also? Said not himself even
now, that it is most strange that men should publish their own esteemings,
without any word of God to warrant them? Animad. p. 101. And did he not very
sharply rebuke M. Sm. heretofore, and count it blnydnes, impiety, abuse of the
word of God, blaspemy, deceit, and dotage, when he applied the Court without
the Temple, and the things spoken thereabout, to the assemblies of Antichrist,
to Antichrists Church, etc. M. Ainsw. defense of Scrip. p. 12, 13, 14, 15. Will
he now thus think of his own dealing, or censure himself in like sort, who
applies to the Beast himself, the things that are spoken of the Church: yea
that confounds the Beast, and the church, as all one? Which what is it else,
but to confound Antichrist the Man of sin, and the Temple of God, as all one:
and this also then, whenas they are purposely and expressly distinguished,
the one from the other?

Animadv. p. 101. 102
40. Most strange also it is, that he says Gods calling is no more in the
church of Rome, then among the heathens. Which I have convinced before, page
188, and 193. etc. And can he ever vvarrant this by the word of God? As for D.
Fulks testimony, I observe it, and agree to many things in it: although he
might have been better advised, then without any limitation to say they taught
the people nothing else, but to pronounce certain Latin words, etc. And where
he says, there were many thousand parishes in England, that in 60 years never
heard sermon in their life: this shows the corruption of that age and
estate: but will it therefore follow, that neither in those parishes, nor in
any other, either of England, or othervvhere, agreeing with the church of Rome
in their profession and constitution, God called any to know him in Jesus
Christ? What will he say, if of later days, since the Pope was abandoned out
of England, there be some parishes that have not had any sermon among them, in
20 or 30 years (or let us suppose, it were 50 or 60 years:) will he therefore
conclude, that there is no more calling neither in those parishes, nor
othervvhere in the church of England, then among the heathens? D. Fulk, if he
lived, would disclayme such collections? M. Broughton says, Millions of
millions of Romes clients are saved. Brough. on Rev. 13, 18. page 203. And
what M. Iunius his judgment is, we see here. And many more might be alleged.
But to let them alone: let this man consider between God and his own soul,
where himself and his followers (of one sort and another) had their calling,
if his assertions here, or his other opinions (not unknowen) touching the
churches aforesaid, be true.

41. Where M. Iunius would make the matter plain by a similitude from Jer. 3.
of a woman committing adultery, whom her husband is willing to pardon,
Animadv. p. 102.
and still to reteyn for his wife, of his own goodness and mercy toward her,
though not according to her desert, who has broken the band of wedlock on her
part, etc. he neither mentions nor answers (as he should) the several
respects purposely noted by M. Iunius. And touching pardon, excluding it
wholly, that which the Apostle speaks expressly and particularly of the Man
of sin, and of them that perish, because they receive not the love of the
truth, etc. 2 These. 2, 9 -- 12. that he applies (for exclusion from pardon,
and certain condemnation) to the whole church of Rome, and so to all the
members thereof (whether particularly, or more generally considered) and that
for all ages, that either have been, are or shall be, ever since the man of sin
and that lavvlesse one, was seated there.

42. He denies that this harlot (the adulterate church of Rome) was ever
Christ's spouse, otherwise then as all the world was by our first parents Adam
and Noe. Ibid.
If this be so, how then has she broken the covenant of wedlock betvveen
Christ and her, if she were never in it? How can she be called a whore, in
respect of Christ, any more then the heathens that never knew God in Christ?
How can she be said to be in apostasy and defection from Christ, if she never
were in the faith and way of Christ? How says himself othervvhere, that the
West churches (of which he knows the church of Rome to be one) were for their
apostasy delivered by God into the hands of that false horned beast,
Antichrist: even as Israel and Judah of old, for their like sins, were
delivered into the hands of the Assyrians and Babylonians. Animadv. p. 84. Or
will he say, that Israel and Judah (with whom himself compares these
Churches) never were the spouse of Christ, otherwise then all the world was, by
our first parents Adam and Noah? No marvel, if he think there is no calling in
that church, any more then among the heathens: if this were so as he says.
And no marvel, if he say, the baptism had in that church, is not true
baptism, but an idol, and nothing in the world, a lying sign, and execrable
sacrament, etc. Hearken again ye Anabaptists: what notorious reasons M. Ains.
has for you: and tell me, if ever any among your selves came to this conceit,
to think that the church of Rome now adulterate, this harlot never was the
spouse of Christ otherwise then as all the world was, by our first parents Adam
and Noah. And hang down your heads (if M. Ains. say right) all ye protestants
and reformed churches; yea and reverse your writings, all M. Calvin Luther,
Broughto^, Whitaker, Raynolds, Iunius, Polanus, Piscator, etc.
ye the godly and learned writers of this later age, who in all your pleading
and leaving of the church of Rome, have still insisted upon this, as a main
ground, that she is an adulteress, at this day, committing whoredom against
Jesus Christ, both by idolatry, and by other apostasy and iniquity; for
which you have left her, and still do thus plead against her. For either your
plea is not good and sound, or M. Ains. answer is frivolous, and his
assertions here notably erroneous.

Animad. p 102.
43. He says moreover: This is not the church of Rome to whom Paul wrote, Romans
1. but another of whom he prophesied, 2 These. 2. She succeeds in the same
place, as the night succeeds the day. The church in Paul's time came from
heaven, Rev. 21, 2. and is long since gone to God: this came up from the
bottomless pit, Rev. 17, 8. and thither she must return. She is of another
religion, the daughter of a strange God. Thus M. Ainsvv. answers M. Iunius in
such sort, as if one (upon occasion of like question in Israel, in the time of
Ieroboams or Manasses apostasy) should have said, This is not the church of
Israel, to whom Moses wrote, and gave Gods laws, Deuteronomy. 31, 24, etc. but
another of whom he prophesied, Deuteronomy 32, 5, 6, 15. etc. But the Scripture
teaches us better to understand things then thus, as he does. The Psalm
speaking of Israel in former and later times, says, The Lord turned the sea
into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in
him. Psalm. 66, 6. And (which comes nearer the cause in hand) Hoseah speaking
to Israel in apostasy, in the time of Jeroboam the second, says: God found
Jacob in Bethel, and there he spoke with us. Hos. 12, 4. Were it not vain
now for one to except and say, Jacob was long since gone to God: this people
of Israel was now of another religion, the daughter of a strange God, etc.
And as for the church of Rome it self, where M. Ains. says: It was another
of which Paul prophesied, 2 These. 2. then that to which he vvrote, Romans 1. he
should remember vvithall, that in the same place Paul says, the mystery of
iniquity did then already work, etc. 2 These. 2, 7. Now I ask, where that
mystery now wrought in Paul's time, and where the Man of sin (there spoken
off) came to be exalted and seated: whether at Rome or not? If he say at Rome,
let him consider with himself, what will follovv thereupon. If he say, it was
not there, let him then show us some other place in Paul's time, where that
mystery of iniquity did then work, and came afterward to be seated, and that
also in the Temple of God: noting vvithall, what now let for a time till it
was taken out of the way: whereof the Apostle likewise speaks in the same
place, 2 These. 2, 4, 6, 7. I could also tell him, that the speech and question
now is not either of particular persons in this or that age, or of several
churches (as he would by his answers dravv it unto) but of one and the same
church, diversely considered, according to the diverse respects that are to be
observed thereabout from time to time. And hereunto he must keep, if he will
answer M. Iunius. Otherwise if he will needs be wandering, let him wander still
on, till he come to answer M. Iunius othervvhere.

Ibid.
44. And note vvithall, how he says here, that the church of Rome to whom Paul
vvrote, Romans 1. is long since gone to God. Yet othervvhere he says, The Church
of Rome, as Paul Romans 11, 20, 21, 22.
forewarned, was for unbelief cut off. Animad. p. 84. Now whom and where did
Paul thus forevvarne? was it not the church of Rome, to whom he wrote? and was
it not in that Epistle which he wrote unto them: which himself here cites for
confirmation thereof? And will he then make it all one, to go to God, and to be
cut off for unbelief? Or will he now for his own plea, admit of diverse
considerations to be had of one and the same church, in diverse respects? If
not, how will he reconcile these things, and clear himself of contradiction?

45. His perverting of the Scripture, and applying to the church, Animad. p.
102.
that which is expressly spoken of the Beast, Rev. 17, 8. into which here
again he runs, I have shevved before. As also, how See before page 113, etc.
the Jews being enemies in themselves, yet are beloved for the Fathers sakes,
Romans 11, 28. observing thereby a diverse consideration to be had of persons and
things, according to diverse respects: as M. Iunius also does in this place,
where he alleges it. To which if M. Ainsvv. will not keep, let him follovv
on his own wandering course.

46. Where he says, If the Jews are beloved for their good fathers sakes:
Animad. p. 102.
then Rome (why says he not, the church of Rome) may well be hated for her
evil fathers sakes. For who were her Fathers, but the Gentiles, Sodomites, and
Egyptians, Rev. 11, 2, 8, 18. not the Saints in Rome: for she is not of their
faith and sanctity: If he mean this of the city of Rome, he speaks not to the
point in hand. If he mean it of the church of Rome, what will he answer if we
allege those sayings of the Prophets, who speaking of the Jews, even of
Jerusalem and Israel, say: Thus says the Lord God unto Jerusalem, Thy birth
and thy nativitie is of the land of Canaan, thy Father was an Amorite, and thy
mother an Hittite. Ezec. 16, 3. And again: Are ye not as children of the
Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel, says the Lord? Amos 9, 7. Will he
say, that Jerusalem and Israel therefore were not ever the spouse of Christ,
any more then the Hittites, Amorites, and Ethiopians? Or will he admit of no
other consideration now of Israel, in any respect, but only ask, as here he
does, Who were their Fathers, but the Hittites, Amorites, and Ethiopians,
Ezec. 16, 3. and Amos 9, 7. not the Patriarks and Saints in Israel; for these
were not of their faith and sanctity? Or will he yet learn to leave off his
cavilling, and by these occasions thus offered by himself, to consider and
speak of persons and things diversely, in diverse respects? Or what will he
answer hereunto? What ever it be, let him take it as an answer to himself: and
in deed against himself, and for us.

47. But he says, there is not so much as likelihood, Ibid. p. 102 103.
that this church is the natural posterity of the Saints in Rome: because
that besides the blooody persecutions in those times, there have been many
changes of the Roman state, and great commotions and troubles, by the Goths,
and Vandals, in the year of Christ, 414, 454, 546. and afterward again by the
Saracens, etc. And what then? The strangers, that came to Israel (whether in
times of synceritie or of apostasy) were of the church of Israel as well as
the Jews, and so to be esteemed, though they were not of the same natural
posterity with them. 2 Chronicles. 15, 9. and 30, 25. with v. 5, 6, 7, etc. and
with Lev. 16, 29. and Numb. 9, 14. Besides, does he think that the bloody
persecutions in those times, cut of the whole church of Rome? Himself will not
say it. Al histories witness otherwise. See but the Acts and Monuments in
the ten first and great persecutions, with the histories there follovving. And
where he speaks of the many changes of the Roman state, and great
commotions, and troubles by the Goths and Vandals, etc. these specially
concern the Roman state (as himself here speaks) touching the city and
Empire of Rome, with the territories and jurisdiction thereof: whereas our
question is only of the church of Rome.

But be it applied to the church, which also went through all that great and
general calamity: yet let us remember, how Jerusalem and Judah of old were
taken by Nebuchadnezar, the city and temple burnt, the land left desolate, the
people of higher and lovver estate, some slain by the svvord, some perishing
with famine and pestilence, others carried away captive into Babylon, and so
remaining in captivity, seventy years: yet God in the midst of his wrath
remembering mercy, still preserved a remnant: whom afterward he called out of
Babylon ( Ier. 51, 45 with Rev. 18, 4.) And in all the changes and calamities
of that people, yet is their estate still to be looked upon, as being the same
people, though living in several ages, and differing greatly one from another,
both in their religion, and other condition, diversely considered. Neither is it
to be neglected, that in all these chaunges and troubles still they continued
circumcision among the^, and were still continued under the covenant of God,
though themselves brake it many ways, and vvalked unvvorthy of it. Psalm. 89,
30 -- 34. Ezec. 16 chap. Which likewise is to be observed concerning the Church
of Rome, and other churches of Christians in apostasy, in the midst of all the
changes and calamities, whereunto they have been subject diversely. Neither can
this man himself show, that ever the church of Rome ceased to be, since it
was first planted, but that it has continued still (either in syncerity, or
apostasy) even to this day: Nor can he show, that the Lord has yet put them
out of his covenant, and given them a bil of divorce; or that they have left
off to baptize in his name, etc.

And yet further (if we mark it well) M. Ain. his answer about this matter,
is much like as the Papists give themselves. When the Papists are urged with
this, that Rome is the seat of Antichrist the Beast, seeing it is the city that
is built on seven hills, whereof John speaks, Rev. 17, 9. they answer, that
in deed Rhem. Annot. on Rev. 17, 9.
Rome of old stood on seven hills: but D. Saunders, etc.
the city is now gone from the hills, and stands in the plain of Campus
Martius, and the Pope sits on the other side of the river, upon the hill
Vaticane, etc. As if by reason of these chaunges, Rome were not Rome still, nor
these Popes the successors of the other Popes that were before, etc. In like
sort, when M. Ains. is urged with this, that the church of Rome is become an
harlot, etc. he answers, that Animad. p. 102, 103
the harlot is not the church of Rome that was of old: it has had many
chaunges and ^^^^rations since, both in religion and the Roman state, etc. As
if therefore the church and city of Rome, were not the church, and City of
Rome still: though they be altered many ways, and in sundry respects.

Many other things hereabout (if it were needful) might also be observed: on
which I purpose not to insist. As, that by the invasion and calamities which
came upon Rome, and the western Empire, by the Goths and Vandals etc. may be
understood the wounding of the Beasts head, spoken off Rev. 13, 3. Now
difference is to be put between the Church, and the Beast, as is aforesaid.
Besides, even the Beasts head thus wounded, was also healed again. Rev. 13,
3. And an head, now vvounded, now healed, is still the same head, though in
several estate and condition. Moreover, his own narration here (how ever it
be understood and applied, whether to the church, or Roman state of the empire
etc:) is against himself. For if Alaricus with his Goths did utterly vvast and
destroy it: what remained for Genscricus with his Vandals afterward to do
thereabout? Or if these did wholy spoil and consume it, what did Odoacer
with another company there afterward? Or if these did effect an utter ruin,
what then did Theodoricus and the Ostrogothes after that? And so may be
observed of the rest here spoken off, of Bellisarius with his army; of Totilas
king of the Goths; of the Saracens, etc. If he say, he speaks not of an
utter destruction, it is the more against himself. Or if he mean it of an
utter destruction, his own narration crosses it, besides the testimony of
all histories. Yea those very clauses, where he says, that Rome for a time
remained without any inhabitant, man or woman, (and that, by the space of
forty days, though he mention not this particular) show that this was not
an utter spoiling of them for altogether, but only for a time: and so is still
against himself.

Furthermore many of those people, that made these invasions, became Christians
themselves, and so the church (in this behalf) was increased. Not to speak how
the very Catalogue of the Bishops of the church of Rome, gives evidence
against him. Or will he say, that though there were Bishops of that Church,
(whether better or worse) yet there was not a church whereof they were
Bishops? And mark, that in the particulars which here he speaks of, the first
time that he notes, is the year of Christ 414. etc. Now let him speak
therefore, whether till this time (and never after) there was at Rome, a
church of God, under the covenant of God, having true baptism, or no.. If he
say, there was not: to what end then is this particular narration of his,
noting such a year, and such a year, etc. Is it not all in vain? If he say,
there was: then it was some hundreds of years after Paul's time, that yet
still it remained the church of God; yea and long after that many great
corruptions, and the hierarchy of Antichrist also, had seized upon it. How
also will he shevve that now at this time (let him take any of the years that
he names) it ceased to be the church of God, and to have Gods baptism and
covenant any longer?

Finally (to bring the truth more clearly to light, and the matter to a plain
issue) let him consider with himself, and speak directly and advisedly,
whether the church of Rome, that was espoused to Christ, is become an harlot,
or not? If he say, it is: himself will soon perceive all his dispute here to
be vain and erroneous. If he say, it is not: how then says he othervvhere,
that she is fallen into Apostasy like Isreal's? Animadv. p. 84. For did not
Israel, being espoused to the Lord, become an harlot? And was it not the same
Israel, for the body of the church, in the account of the Lord and his Prophets
(though not in the same particular persons, at al times) that was both the one
and the other: whether we look on the ten tribes, or on Judah, or both? Esa. 1,
21. Ier. 3 chapter Ezech. 16. and 23 chap. Hos. 2, 1 -- 7. and 3, 1. and 12 chap.
and 13, 4, 5. and 14, 1. Which is likewise to be observed, touching the church
of Rome, and all other churches, in like estate, from time to time. Otherwise
the Papists one way, and the Anabaptists another way, will be confirmed in their
errors, to the hardening of themselves, and seducing of others more and more.
And so let M. Ain. observe the fruit of his opposition of the truth, and
rejoice therein, but not with God.

48. His esteeming of the state of the church of Rome in apostasy, to be but
as the estate of the Ishmaelites, and Edomites, also as Adonisedek with his
Amorites and Jebusites in Jerusalem, etc. is disproved and co^tradicted by
himself, when he makes them like Israel and Judah, in their apostasy. Animad.
p. 84. Neither does M. Iunius give this reason why he accounts the^ the church
of God, because they are the natural posterity of the saints (though this is
not to be neglected, being duly considered) neither because they dwell in Rome,
where the godly lived heretofore. These are things put in by M. Ains. himself:
for what cause, himself knovveth best. M. Iunius knew, that there dwell Jews
at Rome, who are not of the church, and that the natural posterity of the
Saints, may become Jews, Turks, Pagans, and (as here he said expressly) See
here before page 185.
the church may at length cease to be a church, when God cease to call it
back, and takes away the evidence of their holy marriage, that is, the holy
Scripture, out of the hand of the adulteress, etc.

49. Where M. Ainsw. infers, that thus our reasons from Israel, are also
impertinent to the present estate of the church of Rome: Animadv. p. 103.
he should remember, how himself said before, that the typical estate of
Israel, is our 1 Cor. 10 6, 11.
ensamples: Animad. p. 87. and more particularly, the Apostasy of the church
of Rome, is like Isreal's. Animad. page 84: But contradictions are not uncouth
with him, since he began to turn himself into all colors, for the
mainteyning (what he can) of his errors and sinful courses.

50. Above all, observe and remember, that now he says, our reasons from
Israel, Animad. p. 103.
might well serve for the times wherein John lived, when the true churches
were many of them apostate: Rev. 2, and 3 chap. Yet here before he said, that
Israel in their apostasy were not the Lords people, or wife, nor under his
covenant, etc. Animad. page 82. and that their sacraments were false, and lying
signs, etc. How then should our reasons from Israel, serve for those churches,
which here himself calls true churches: unles he will say that true churches,
and (in particular) those churches in John's time, spoken of Rev. 2 and 3 chapter
were not the Lords people, or wife, nor under his covenant: and that their
sacraments were false, and lying signs, etc. If not, will he now say, that
the case of Israel in apostasy, was like the estate of the churches
aforesaid, which here he says were apostate: and that therefore they also were
now the Lords people and wife, under his covenant, having true sacraments, the
signs and seals of Gods covenant, etc. Or seeing these churches which he
says were apostate, are yet by the Lord esteemed golden Candlesticks, in the
midst whereof Christ now vvalked, etc. Rev. 1, 12, 20. and 2, 1. will he so
acknovvledge likewise concerning Israel, with whom now he matcheth these
Churches (that so he might the better, as he thinks, exclude the church of
Rome, from all comparison therewith?) If not, how will he reconcile these
things together.

51. Note also, how now he acknowledges them to be true Churches, Ibid.
which he says were apostate: whereas still throughout his discourse and
reasoning, he denies apostate churches to be true churches. What now vvil his
followers and favorites say hereunto, who can make no end of their odious
exclamations, against others that speak any such thing: though it be with
distinction, and upon just and needful occasion, for clearing the truth, and
convincing of error, etc.

52. What also will himself and his followers say to this, Ibid.
that the churches which he says were apostate, are by the Lord himself
acknowledged for golden Candlesticks; and churches wherein Christ walks; and
their ministers also to be stars in the right hand of Christ, etc. Rev. 1,
11, 12, 16, 20. and 2, 1. etc. and 3, 1, etc. Will they now admit of a diverse
consideration of the same churches, and of their ministry, and estate, in
diverse respects? If not, how will they reconcile their own assertions and
the Scriptures together, which are alleged by themselves? Rev. 2, and 3
chapters.

53. Where M. Iunius comes again to a double consideration of the church of
Rome: one, as it has all the divine things in the Scriptures, another as it
has them al corrupt, etc. M. Ains. (after his manner) passes by sundry things
of special moment, which M. Iunius purposely notes hereabout: Ibid.
neither keeps he to the points in hand, as he should: besides that he
speaks sometimes of things granted by all; or takes for granted things which
he should prove, and which I have before again and again disproved: As namely,
that still he confounds as all one, the Church, and the Beast arisen out of
the bottomless pit: And, that he makes the church of Rome to be the woman or
city that (in John's time) reigned over the kings of the earth. Rev. 17, 1, 18.
And where he says, it is not properly the old church of Rome corrupted; but a
new church arisen out of the bottomless pit: what means he here by the word
properly? Or does he grant it improperly to be the old church of Rome
corrupted? why then said he here before, that it was never Christ's spouse,
otherwise then as all the world was, by our first parents Adam and Noah.
Animad. page 102. And where against has he disputed all this while? Not to
speak, how sharply he rebuked M. Sm. when he would distinguish between the
worship of the New Testament properly so called, and not properly. M. Ainsvv.
Defense of Script. page 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

54. But it is not the woman fled into the wilderness: What then? Ibid.
Difference is to be put between the inward parts of the Temple, and the
outvvard; betvveen the parts of the Temple that were measured, and the parts
that were left unmeasured; betvveen the Temple of God, with the Altar, and
worshippers therein, spoken off Rev. 11, 1. and between the court of the Temple
given to the Gentiles, and the holy city trod down by them two and forty
months, as is said Rev. 11, 2. If it be not one of these, shall it therefore be
none of them? If it be not the inner part of the Temple, vvil it therefore
follow that it is not the outvvard? Or is not the outward Court and city also
the Lords, because they are not the inward parts of the Temple that are
measured, but left out unmeasured, and given to the Gentiles, and trod upon by
them, the time appointed. This man himself does here presently after,
acknovvledge, that the church of Rome, is the Animad. p. 104.
court of Gods Temple invaded, and the holy city trod down by the Gentiles,
Rev. 11, 2. And othervvhere he teaches, that the Defense of Script. p. 13, 14,
15.
court of the Temple, and the holy city (spoken off, Revel. 11, 2.) did signify
the Bhurch of God: and, that this also is the doctrine of all the Prophets:
citing to that end, Psalm. 51, 18. and 87. and 122. Esa. 60. Revel. 21. Where
moreover he shows, that Jerusalem is often called the holy city, Nehem. 11,
1. Esa. 48, 2. and 52, 1. Mat. 4, 5. All which things lead us to look upon the
Church of Rome, as being answerable to the Lords courts and city of Jerusalem.

Besides, when was the time, that the woman fled into the wilderness? Was it
in Constantines time (when one would least have thought it, in such a time of
peace and outvvard flourishing of the Church) three hundred years after Christ:
as M. Bright man on Rev. 12, 6, 14, 15. and 11, 1, 2.1. etc. M. Forbes on Rev.
12 s. 10, etc.
some of good judgment do write? If so it be understood, shall we then think
there was no outward visible church or Churches in the world from that time,
to this later age, for the space of twelve or thirteen hundred years? Where
then, and how were the Court of the Temple and holy city trod upon by the
Gentiles, and that for the space of two and forty months? Rev 11, 2. Where did
Antichrist now sit in the Temple of God, all this while? 2 These. 2, 4. Or had
not the Christian apostate churches, baptism, and other ordinances of God
continued among them (though with corruptions) all this time: as Judah and
Israel had circumcision and other constitutions of God, in the time of their
apostasy?

If it be applied to the times and invasions of the Goths and Vandals spoken
of before: like consequences will follovv, as upon the former: and somevvhat
more, inasmuch as these also wasted the churches of Africa: besides all the
spoil that they did in the west, as is aforesaid. Or let this man himself name
any time (whatsoever likes him best) for the woman's flight into the
vildernes: and he shall still find like consequences, and other more to follow
thereupon. Finally let him consider, where himself and his followers had their
baptism? whether in any visible Church of God, or not? And, whether the
Lords ordinance of baptism has not ben continued, and deduced from the
Apostles, unto our days, through all the time and estate of the apostasy
aforesaid?

Animadv. p. 104.
55. Where he makes the church of Rome answerable to the army of Canaanites,
Gentiles, Babylonians, Infidels, etc. to whom now will he resemble the wolf
Antichrist himself with his sheeps skin and lambs horns? keeping due
proportion with the cases spoken of in the Scriptures here cited by him self?
Mat. 7, 15. Rev. 13, 11. and 16, 16. Judge. 5, 19. Rev. 11, 2. Psalm. 79, 1. etc.
Ier. 51, 1, 2. etc. Lam. 1, 10. Or will he still confound these, as all one:
which he sees M. Iunius does purposely distinguish? Or will he needs
contradict himself with one and the same breath, whiles here he makes the
church of Rome to be also the Court of Gods Temple, and holy city, invaded and
trodden down by the Gentiles? Rev. 11, 2. Or finally will he not cease to
speak M. Sm. language, whom, when he applied this to the synagogue of
Antichristians (as now himself does) he rebuked very sharply, as I have
shevved here before, page 133. and may be seen in his Defense of Script. page
12 -- 15.

56. Why also says he, Ibid.
At first those Gentiles invaded the courts of Gods temple, and trod down the
holy city, Rev. 11, 2. as if this had been Gods court and city but at first, and
that this invasion and treading down had been soon done: when as in this very
place, which himself cites, it is said, they were given to the Gentiles, and
trodden upon by them, for the space of two and forty months, or (as is in the
next verse follovving) a thousand two hundred and sixty days: whenas yet all this time they are still the Lords court and city, though defiled and trod
down, as Jerusalem and the Sanctuary was, by the heathens of old. Psa. 79,
1. Dan. 8, 9-13. and 11, 31. etc. And why moreover makes he his inference
thus, If that army of infidels ^ere Gods true church, so is the synagogue of
Antichristians: and not rather thus, If that city and sanctuary (though
profaned and trod down) was still Gods true Temple and city, so also is the
church of Rome: which is here compared thereunto?

57. When he says, the Heathens in their altars, Ibid.
temples sacrifices etc. had the divine things of God among them as well, if not
better, then has the Man of sin and his worshippers, in their sacrifice of
the Mass, and other manifold Idolatries: why says ^e not, then has the
church of Rome in their Baptism, and other divine things of God had among
them, though corrupted? Does himself per^eiue, that thus his assertions would
be plainly false, and not so deceive ^he simple, as now they do? Or sees he
not, that M. Iun. speaks expres^y of the church of Rome, and does purposely
distinguish betvveen it, and ^he man of sin with his hierarchy? Why then
keeps he not to the point in ^and? Why confounds he things that differ? As if
that circumcision and ^he other divine things of God, had in Judah and Israel,
though corruptly ^sed in the time of their apostasy, were not to be
distinguished from their ^olatries, whether in feasts, sacrifices, or other
things which they had a^ong them, of their own forging and devising? 1 King.
12, 28 -- 33. 2 King. ^6, 10 -- 16. with 2 Chorn. 28, 2, 3, 4. and 33, 1 -- 9.

58. Where See here before, p. 186.
M. Iunius purposely answers two doubts and difficulties, by which the minds
of many are troubled: the first, what we are to judge of the members (...)
the church of Rome; the latter what the duty of them is, who are in that
church, and ^^e the great corruptions thereof: M. Ains. passes by the first,
whereof special regard should be had: and coming to the latter, he clippeth
M. Iunius answers (as he is wont) omitting diverse things of weight: and
having not what to answer, sets himself to cavil at those words, where M.
Iunius says, [the duty of those that are in the popish church, and see the
grievous corruptions of it, is such as of those children, which dwell with
their adulterous mother, that is, to abhor her sin, with speech and sign
to call her back from evil, to absteyn themselves there from, and in all things
to cleave to their father, etc.] Thus (says he) it appears, that these our
Opposites are returned to acknovvledge the whore of Rome, to be their mother,
etc. But first, this is no answer to the point in hand. Has M. Iunius here set
down that which is right and agreeable to the word of God, or not? If he
have, why yields he not unto it? If he have not, why does he not confute it?
Secondly, why does he not also infer, saying, [Thus it appears, that these
our opposites acknowledge the Lord God to be their Father, to whom in all
things they are to cleave, etc. Thirdly, may not godly Christians (being in
such estate, and so demeaning themselves, as M. Iunius speaks) acknowledge
the adulterate church of Rome to be their mother, as the godly Jews did
acknowledge Jerusalem, Judah, and Israel, being harlots, to be their mother
notwithstanding? Esa. 1, 21. with 50, 1. Jer. 15, 8. Ezech. 16, 3, 44, 45. and
23, 2, 3, 4, etc. Hos. 2, 1, 2. and 3, 1. etc. Lastly, what church for their
mother, had these men themselves, wherein they were borne and baptized, and
with whom they lived, till they came to be thus persuaded as now they are?
Any, or none? Let them look about and tell us: and then see, what will follow.

Ibid.
59. And whereas M. Ains. (to have the more color for his exception) takes
hold of those words, where M. Iunius in other places before compared (he says
feigned) the estate of the church of Rome to be [as Se before page 184.
a body which lies svvollen with waters of the dropsy, or with poison,
which had long ago given up the ghost, if God by the medicine of his grace,
etc. had not nourished and kept her warm:] First, why esteems he these
similitudes to be but M. Iunius fictions? Are they not fit and pertinent, for
the matter in hand? If not, why has he not disproved them? Or are the
similitudes which M. Ainsw. uses himself, to be esteemed but as fictions of
his own? When here before he compared the hierarchy of Antichrist to the
Egyptian boyles, and to the Image which Nebuchadnezar savv, would he have it
thought, that these were but his own feignings. Animadv. p. 100. Or when D.
Rayn. six Conclusions, in the fifth of them: as they are printed in his
Conference with Heart, page 650.
D. Raynolds uses the same similitudes, as M. Iunius does here, will he say
also, they are his fictions? But specially, why answers he not M. Iunius (if
he be able) to the points in hand, neither here, nor in the other places
aforesaid? If they were but fictions only that M. Iun. feigneth, they might
be the sooner and soundlyer ansvvered. And besides when M. Iunius says, [she
had long ago given up the ghost, if God by the medicine of his grace and long
suffering had not nourished her:] why leaves he out that word of Gods long
suffering, and puts in for it, etc. was it so much or so long to write down
this clause, when he wrote all the rest? Or thinks he, that God has used no
long suffering toward that church, as he has done toward other? Or would
he, that the Reader should not observe it, because it is against himself? But
to proceed, let us hear, what he infers upon the foresaid speeches of M.
Iunius: Now (says he) to leave their mother thus on her sick bed, as they have
done ( My treat of the Minister. page 60 -- 62.
disclayming all Christian duty unto her, which My treat of the Minister.
page 60 -- 62.
is due to a true church in corruption) is but the part of unnatural children.
Whiles God does nourish and keep her vvarme, will they quite abandon her? As
if M. Iunius had not here purposely and expressly said, [1. That See here
before, page 186.
the duty of such as are in that church, and see the great corruptions of it,
is as of children that dvvell with their adulterous mother. In which case, a
wise son will abhor and absteyn from his mothers sin, and will with
speech and sign call her back from evil, and in all things cleave unto his
father: and while he can by reason of his mother, will cleave unto her, next
after his father: but when and vvhiles by reason of her, he cannot do it with
good conscience, for the spiritual and bodily injury of her, will then betake
himself into the chamber or inner room of his father, where also is the
church, the mother of us all. Gal. 4, 26. Secondly, that this therefore is not
a good consequent, if one depart from this or that church, therefore he does
altogether depart from the church. Yea, that he does but trifle, that does so
from a particular, conclude universally, etc. Thirdly, that the duty aforesaid,
was religiously performed by our ancestors, who^ the popish tyranny for some
ages exercised, etc.] Which M. Iunius shows largely in sundry particulars:
as may be seen here before, page 186, 187. And what now would these men have
more to be done? Would they, that such as since have been borne and brought up
in other churches, should return to the church of Rome, and do likewise? Or
have themselves done the like to such, as they hold to be true Churches in
corruption? Or know they not, that when Judah and Israel became harlots, the
Lord taught the godly, to plead with them, as with their mother, and yet to
leave and let them alone, and not to partake in their idolatries or other
corruptions? Hos. 2, 1, 2. and 4, 1, 15, 17. Amos 3, 1, 2. with 4, 4, 5. and
5, 5. Mich. 6, 1, 2, 16. with Ezech. 23, 2, 3, 4 -- 36. and Ier. 15, 19. and
Esa. 8, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18.

60. Animadv. p. 104.
Where he speaks of the church of Rome being dead long ago in her sins
Rev. 20, 5. with Ephesians. 2, 1.) he had also the like before, of apostate
Israel being dead in their sins, Hos. 3, 1. Animad. p. 70. Where let the
Reader see, what I have noted thereabout, here before, page 87, 88. etc.
Besides that if this death, be (as M Bright M. Forbes, etc. on Rev. 20, 5.
some think) the apostasy spoken off 2 These. 2, 3. we must then remember
vvithal, that this apostasy is in the Temple of God 2 These. 2, 4. like as
there was apostasy in Judah and Israel heretofore: and that difference
therefore is to be put between Gods temple, and the apostasy it self; as
between Judah and Israel, and their apostasy; Ezech. 16, and 23. with 1 King.
15, 34. and 2 King. 21, 11. betvveen the Lords courts, and the Gentiles
domineering therein; Rev. 11, 2. and betvveen Gods people, and the former and
later Babylon, spoken off Jer. 51, 45. and Rev. 18, 4. And moreover also, that
the dead (spoken off in the place here alleged by himself) live again and
reign with Christ after the finishing of a thousand years, Rev. 20, 5. whereas
he speaks of the church of Rome, as being gone long since, damned, and dead
for ever. Animadv. p. 98, 102, 104. So as even this Scripture, which himself
cites (if it be well observed) will be found to be against himself: and that
other place likewise which he cites, touching another death (which may be
understood of the plague) and the utter burning of Babylon with fire, when the
smoke of her burning shall be seen to ascend, as did the smoke of Sodom, like
the smoke of a furnace. Rev. 18, 7, 8, 9, 18. with Genesis 19, 28. which the
Scripture it self refers and applies to the City, that great city,
resembled by Babylon, and Babylons destruction, that was of old: from which it
shall never rise: Rev. 18, 2, 19, 20, 21. with Jer. 50, and 51 chapt.

Which vengeance on that great city Babylon, the Lord God, that is strong, will
certainly take and accomplish. And then shall we be so far from mourning at
her funeral, as we shall rejoice Rev. 18, 20.
with the heavenly multitude, and sing Hallelujah, when the Lord has given Genesis
19, 28.
Sodoms judgment on her, and we see her smoke rise up for evermore. Rev. 19,
1, 2, 3. In the mean time, (touching the church, Temple, and people of God) as
M. Iunius distinguishing betvveen the Temple of God, and the apostasy of
Antichrist, helped forvvard the consuming of the one, and prayed for grace and
mercy to the other: so do we also humbly beseech the Lord, with mercy to
behold and care for his church, and whatsoever belongs thereunto; and daily
to call and deliver out of Babylon his people al, increasing his mercies and
graces upon them, to the edification of his church, the salvation of all his
people, and the praise of the glory of his grace for evermore. Amen.

And thus much concerning M. Iunius his treatise of the church of Rome. Where
about I have written much more then at first I purposed: considering on one
hand, how godly and learned he was, and being now deceased can not answer for
himself; and on another hand how unworthily this Opposite has dealt with
him: who if he could have ansvvered him, should have done it soundly,
remembering still with whom he did encounter; if not, he should have laid his
hand on his mouth, and kept himself silent: and that would have been accounted
unto him for wisdom.

61. Together with M. Junius Advert. page 113.
was alleged also the testimony of Amandus Polanus (another godly and learned
man) who said that Antichrist must sit in the Temple of God (2 These. 2, 4.)
not Jewish or at Jerusalem, but Christian, that is, in the Christian church.
Polan. on Ezech. 39. page 733. M. Ains. answers He was mistaken. Animadv. p.
104. 105
The same, that Bellarmine and other Papists answer the Protestants hereabout.
Bellarm. de Pontif. Romans lib. 3, cap. 13. Rhem. Annot. on 2 These. 2. sect. 11.
Behold, vvhither M. Ains. now is carried.

Polanus moreover for further confirmation of his assertion, alleged
Chrysostom, Theophylact, Ambrose, Hilarie, Jerome, Theodoret, Oecumenius,
Augustine and Thomas Aquinas also: referring the Reader for their testimonies,
to his Catholic Symphonie, chap. 24. These. 3. And therevvithall we adjoined
the testimony of Keckerman (a good writer also of this age, who speaking of
the popish church, says, It is not a pure church, but very corrupt, like as a
rotten apple is in deed an apple, but corrupt: and as a man infected with the
plague is a man, but not a sound man. Keckerm. Praepar. ad sacram synaxin. page,
83. Ibid.
Now M. Ainsvv. answers all alike, that they are mistaken, in judging of that
rotten church. So (in his judgment) all are mistaken hereabout, but himself and
his followers; who are mistaken most of all, and yet will not see and
acknovvledge it, though it be shevved unto them.

62. Last of all, to countenance his cause the more (that I may use his own
words) he sets it out with the name and judgment of Animad. p. 105, etc
many learned men, specially of our own country, M. Cartwright, M. Perkins,
D. Fulk, D. Willet, and M. Bale, who are now deceased (all of them, save
one:) to whose judgment in other things he would be loath to stand. So now
himself does that, which here before he carped at, or blamed in us. Animad. p
98. For the men themselves, they were in deed learned and godly: and to their
writings, in many things we condescend: but vvish that in some things they had
spoken more advisedly, and written more soundly, then they have done. To rip
up particulars wherein they erred, I am loath: having both reverend estimation
of the men, and knowing that none lives, who is not subject to err in some
things, seeing we al know but in part. 1 Cor. 13, 9. Yet that the truth may
better be searched out, and no way praejudiced by the names and judgment of
these learned men: I have thought it not amiss, briefly to note thus much
touching the points in hand, and their sayings here produced, being compared
with other speeches of theirs othervvhere: that if the Reader do well mind
them, he shall find some of their assertions to be erroneous, and very grounds
of Anabaptistrie, some to be doubtfully spoken by them, and some with crossing
of themselves and one another; besides that sundry things which properly and
directly concern the man of sin, they apply to the church and Temple of God
it self, not distinguishing things aright, as they might and should have done:
Which M. Iunius See here before, p. 184.
notes particularly, to be a special means, whereby many are deceived
hereabout.

M. Cartwright (he says) vvrote that the children of Papists are not in the
covenant of God. T. C. Reply 1, p. 173. How came himself then, and the reformed
churches, under Gods covenant, being descended of Papists? Or were they
baptized, before they were under Gods covenant? Or shall we think, that
apostate christians are not answerable to the apostate Israelites of Judah and
the ten tribes, among whom (in the time of their apostasy) God continued his
covenant, and circumcision the sign thereof? Finally, how then is it true that
D. Raynolds says, though D. Rayn. fifth Conclusion: joined with Hearts
conference, page 657.
the Romanists have greatly and grievously hurt baptism with their annoyances,
yet the substance thereof, and as it were the life, has been preserved whole
and sound through Gods mercy? If their children be not in the covenant of God,
how has the substance and life of baptism ben preserved sound among them by
the mercy of God? But of this, I have spoken sufficiently here before, p. 28,
35, 58, etc. 121, etc.

M. Cartwright also (says he) writes, that the church of Rome is no church.
T.C. Reply 2. p. 146. How then is it the Temple of God, where Antichrist
sits? 2 These. 2, 4. or the Court of the Temple, and holy city, trod down
by the Gentiles, two and forty months? Rev. 11, 2. And why does M. Perkins
say (as here he alleges) that In his expos. of the Creed, tit. church.
Animadv. p. 106.
it is no true or sound member of the catholic church? According to M.
Cartwrights speech, he should have said, it is no member of the Catholic
church at al. Or when D. Raynolds disputes, that the church of Rome is not a
sound member of the catholic church, does he mean, that it is no member at
all thereof? How then says he, that the substance and life of baptism has been preserved whole and sound therein through the mercy of God, as is
aforesaid. But of this also enough is spoken here before, page 120, etc.

D. Fulk (he says) In his answer to the Counterf. Catholic. Art. 11.
tells the Papists, that they have nothing in deed, but the Synagogue of Satan.
Yet D. Fulk otherwhere answering the Rhemes Annotations on 2 These. 2, 4. first
tells the Papists, that Sect. 11.
the church of Christ is by the Apostle called the Temple of God, 1 Cor. 3, 16,
17. 2 Cor. 6. Rev. 3, 12. wherefore (says he, speaking now doubtfully) the
Apostle means, that Antichrist shall sit in the visible church of God, or that
which is so called and commonly reputed. And afterward, when he has shevved
the judgment of diverse ancient writers thereabout, tells the Papists plainly,
Ibid. sect. 12.
Thus you see by the most and best approved Authors judgment, Antichrist should
sit in the church of God. If then it be the church of God, have they nothing in
deed, but the Synagogue of Satan?

D. Willet (he says) Synopsis Papismi. Co^tr. 2. of the church. q. 5. par. 2.
utterly denies that they are a true visible church of Christ. But do any of
his arguments prove it? Let the Reader consider, and mark it with judgment.
Again he says Ibid. Co^trov. 4. q. 10. part. 5.
2 These. 2. he shall sit in the Temple of God, that is, the visible church,
that which sometime was a true visible one, as the Church of Rome, and after
should so be taken, reputed and challenged, as it is at this day by the
Papists. Yet a little after in the same place he says, Paul speaks not here,
of any material Temple, but of the church of God: neither does S. Paul in this
sense refuse to use the name of Temple, as 1 Cor. 3, 16. and 6, 19. and in
other places. Now if the name of the Temple of God be so used by the Apostle in
the other place of 2 These. 2, 4. as it is here, in these places, 1 Cor. 3, 16.
and 6, 19. and otherwhere: then it signifies the church and Temple of God, not
only that is so taken and reputed, but that is so in deed. For so in these
other places it is understood. Moreover, when M. Willet proves the churches of
the Protestants, and namely the church of England, to be true visible churches,
he uses this for his first argument. Ibid. co^trov. 2, q. 5 part. 2.
That church which sends sorth Martyrs, as Christ's faithful souldjours, is
the true church. This Proposition (says he) I think, is not doubted off: for
out of the church there are no Martyrs. If this then be an undoubted argument,
either he must show that the church of Rome affords no Martyrs against the
Turks, and other professed enemies of the Christian faith: or if it do, he
yields, it must needs be the church of God.

M. Bale notes diverse things, which Image of both churches, in the Prof.
apperteyn to the man of sin, and plainly show, that the Pope is Antichrist:
As, where he says, The Pope makes his boast, that he is the high Priest, he
is of equal power with Peter, he cannot err, he is head and spouse of the
Church, etc. But difference is to be put between the Temple of God, and
Antichrist the man of sin sitting therein, etc. as has been often showed here
before, page 125, 137, 183, etc. Besides, speaking of the Turk, he says, he
will in no case grant Christ to be the son of God, nor that he dyed here for
man's redemption. Yet both these are acknowledged by the church of Rome, as I
have showed here before, by their own profession. Page 122.

Other things that might further be observed out of those men's writings about
the assertions aforesaid, I will not insist upon. It may suffice, that M.
Ainsvv. himself says here, Animad. page 105.
it is not to be marveled at, though wise and godly men be mistaken, for in
many things we sin all Jam. 3, 2. And good it were for this man himself and
his followers, that they had this wisdom and godlynes, in synceritie and
humblenes of mind thus to think and acknowledge of themselves, that they are
mistaken, and sin in many things: then would they not be so stif, and self
conceited in their fore-conceived opinions and former practices, even when
better is showed unto them, by the word of God.

Now having thus treated of the points aforesaid, and of the understanding of
that Scripture, 2 These. 2, 4. touching Antichrist sitting in the Temple of God:
I will by this occasion yet further (before I conclude) annex herevvithall the
judgment and testimony both of ancient and later Writers, concerning these
things, not naming all that might be alleged, but a few only of each sort: as
follovveth.

Testimonies of ancient Writers.
Chrysostom (speaking of Antichrist) says, He shall sit in the Temple of God,
not that which is at Jerusalem, but in the Temple of the church. Chrysostom.
homil. 3, in Epist. ad These. 2.

Theophylact says, Not in the Temple, which is at Jerusalem specially, but
simply in the churches, and in every Temple of God. In 2 These. 2.

Oecumenius has likewise, He says not the Temple of Jerusalem, but the
churches. In 2 These. 2. Item Severianus apud Oecumenium, ibid.

Theodoret says, He calls the Temple of God, the churches, in which
Antichrist shall arrogate unto himself the chief seat. In 2 These. 2.

Augustine says, The Temple of any Idol or Devil, the Apostle would not call
the Temple of God. De civit. Dei, l. 20, c. 19. Whereof also see here before,
p. 147.

Ambrose likewise says, So that in the house of God, he sits in the seat of
Christ. In 2 These. 2.

Testimonies of later Writers. etc.
Calvin says, Paul places not Antichrist any otherwhere, then in the very
Sanctuary of God. 2 These. 2, 4. Of which also see more here before, page 164.

Hemmingius says, By these marks (spoken off 2 These. 2, 4.) is signified, that
Antichrist is not any one properly out of the visible church. Ibid in 2 These. 2.

Iunius says, That the papacy is in the church, as the order or estate of
apostasy in the house of and city of God, is as certain, as that of the
Apostle is certain, 2 These. 2. that the man of sin, the son of perdition
sits in the Temple of God, with his whole order or estate of apostates. Lib.
singulari de Ecclesia contra Bellarm. cap. 17. In fol. page 1020. Of which
point, and many other things concerning this matter, see more here before, page
183. etc.

Zanchius says,] I agree not with them, that think the church of Rome has
ceased to be the church of Christ, as well as the east churches, which afterward
became Mahumetane. What church ever was more corrupt, then the church of the
ten tribes? Yet by the Scriptures we have learned, that it was the church of
God. And how has Paul called the Church, wherein the said Antichrist should sit,
the Temple of God? Neither is it Baptism that is administered out of the Church
of Christ. Neither does a wife cease to be a wife, because she is an
adulteress: except she be manifestly divorced, being deprived of the ring, the
pledge of the marriage covenant. The Church of Rome therefore is yet the church
of Christ. But what a church? So corrupt, so depraved, and oppressed with such
tyranny, as we neither can with good conscience partake of their holy things,
nor safely dwell among them. In Praefat. librorum de Natura Dei.

Polanus says,] A particular church is either pure, or impure. A pure church,
is a company of such as have the true religion uncorrupted. etc. It is very
commonly called a true church, but by a Synecdoche. For every pure church of
God is also a true church: but every true church is not always pure: except
that true and pure be taken for all one, as very often it is. Like as all pure
gold is taken for true gold; but all true gold is not always pure: for gold
mixed with dross, is in deed true gold, but is not yet pure, till it be
severed from the dross. A leprous man also is a true man, but not pure or
clean. So is the church of Rome as yet a Christian church, but leprous and
most impure. I will speak it more plainly: A true Church is so called
ambiguously: either as it is opposed to an impure church, or as it is opposed
to a false church. If a church be said to be a true one, as it is opposed to
that which is impure, then it is al one as pure and orthodoxe. But if it be
opposed to a false, and therefore no church, then it is not all one as pure.
For at the time when Christ was borne and lived on the earth, the church of the
Jews was a true church of God, but it was not pure: because it was corrupt
both in the doctrine and discipline thereof. And except these things be
distinguished, it will follow that there has been some time, when there was no
true church of God in the world: which is most absurd. Polani Syntag. in fol.
tomb. 2. libr. 7. cap. 8. page 544. And a little after again, An impure Church,
is a company wherein religion is corrupt. And it is either less impure, or
more impure, or most impure of all. etc. The church of Rome at this day is yet
the church of Christ (but most impure of all, but most corrupt of all, and
almost giving up the ghost:) because there is yet in it God calling, there are
in it the called, and calling, which constitute a church; because it reteyneth
yet somewhat of the doctrine of Christ, though mixed with many errors, and
because it reteyneth Baptism the sign of Christianity, in the substantial
form thereof, though defiled with many blemishes and corruptions: as also
because it reteyneth yet some invocation of Christ the mediator: Otherwise
they that are baptized in Popery, should be baptized out of the church, and
therefore not with the baptism of Christ. Briefly, the church of Rome at this
day has all things corrupted, but not altogether. As of old the church of
Jerusalem, so at this day the Church of Rome, is like unto a vineyard, which
Christ fenced about with a wall, and gathered out the stones thereof, and
planted it with the choicest vines, and built a tower in the midst of it, and
made a wine press therein: but it brought not forth grapes, but wild grapes.
Esa. 5, 1. etc. For the church of Rome is to be distinguished from the Popes
Church or faction of Antichrist, which prevails in the church of Rome, and
will not suffer them that profes Christ more purely, but labors to oppress
them, that it alone may have al. etc. Seeing therefore the church of Rome at
this day is most impure, and the popes church is that spiritual Babylon, it is
altogether to be forsaken, as the spirit of God commands Revel. 18, 4. Come
out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye
receive not of her plagues. Ibid. page 549, 550. [More al so he has hereabout,
in his vvritings otherwhere. Of which, and of Keckermans testimony vvithall,
see here before, p. 178, and 208, and 209. and in the Advertism. page 113.

Paraeus says,] The Jesuits accuse us, that we have made a division,
departing from the church. But we have not departed from the church, but from
the Papacy: we came out of Babylon, at the Lords commandment, who says, Come
out of her my people. Paraeus in Romans 16.18.

Piscator says,] The Temple of Solomon was a type of three things: First, of
the body of Christ, as appears by his words, John 2, 19. and by Paul's words,
Col. 2, 9. Secondly, of the Church, as appears by the words of Paul, 2 These.
2, 4. also by the words of Peter, 1 Pet. 2, 5. and by the words of John, Rev.
3, 12. Thirdly, of each of the faithful, as Paul's words show, 1 Cor. 3, 16. and
6, 19. and 2 Cor. 6, 16. Piscat. Obser. in 1 Reg. 6. c. [Again he says,] Paul
describes Antichrist, first by his wickedness, calling him a man of sin, that
is, wholly given unto sin; secondly, by the punishment that shall come upon him
according to the decree of God, calling him the son of perdition, that is,
appointed by God to perdition or eternal destruction; thirdly, by his
intolerable impudency and pride, that he shall oppose himself against Christ,
and exalt himself above God himself; fourthly, by the place, where he shall
rule and exercise his tyranny, to wete, in the temple of God, that is, in the
church. Piscat. Analys, in 2 These. 2, 3, 4.

M. Bradford, a faithful martyr of our own country, disputing with the Bishop
of Chichester, says,] That wicked man sits in the Temple of God, that is,
the church: for it cannot be understood of Mahomet, or any out of the church,
but of such as bear rule in the church. Act. and Monum. page 1616.

M. Brightman treating of Antichrist, speaks very often of his sitting and
dominering in the church. As when he says,] The Dragon is the open enemy,
throughout this book, who were the Emperors of Rome, as long as they remained
heathens. The Turks play this part in these last ages. The Beast is a more
close and crafty enemy, who is Antichrist that sits in the Temple of God,
Brightm. on Rev. 16, 13. In the English, page 552. [Againe,] To be extolled
above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, is not to be extolled
above that one God in heaven, but above every God in earth, that is, above all
magistrates; not only those that be of the inferior sort, but also above all
that Majesty that is sovereign amongst men, the highest Emperors themselves,
who are called Augusti in Latin, as they be Sebastoi in Greek, of the high
reverence and worship that is done to them. Lastly, as touching the true God,
if Antichrist should acknowledge no other God but himself, how should he sit in
the Temple of God, as the Apostle says, he should sit, 2 These. 2, 4. M.
Brightm. treatise of Antichrist, against Bellar. on Rev. 17, chapter 1. page 628,
629. [And again,] He should not deny the Father openly, seeing that by this
means he should be openly known to be an Atheist: which is contrary to that
which the Apostle teaches, who says, that he should sit in the Temple of God.
Ibid. p. 629, 630. [And again,] There is not one little word left for you out of
the Scriptures, which can teach that Antichrist shall be a certain or singular
man, after the right manner of concluding: but we have demonstrated out of them
most certainly, that he is that Apostaticall Sea of those, that shall dominere
in the church. Ibid. chap. 2, p. 642. And the like he has often othervvhere.

M. Robbinson also says,] The constitution even of Rome (as now it stands) is
not simply false, but only in this and that respect. Iustif. of Separat. page
88.

And many more I might allege, of all sorts of Writers and Witnesses: but these
may suffice. Yea it is enough alone, that Gods Word does so teach and confirm
it, as before is manifested.

The Conclusion.
HItherto of these things concerning the Church of Rome. Whereabout I have
written the more largely, to help forvvard (what in me is) the better
searching out, and more clearing of the truth, both against Popery on the one
hand, and Anabaptistrie on the other. For with the Papists, there is nothing
more common, in pleading for the estate of that church, then thus to reason and
ask, Seeing it is granted, that the church of Rome was the church of God in
the Apostles times, when was it since that she ceased so to be? In which of
the Centuries after Christ? In what Popes days, etc. Whereunto some answer,
about 300 years after Christ, when at the Nicene Council the primacie of that
Sea was so and so acknowledged; some think sooner, straight after the
Apostles days; some later, about four hundred years after Christ, others
about five, and some about six hundred after Christ, etc. Hereupon the Papists
insult, and both harden themselves, and trouble others very much hereabout.

On the other hand, the Anabaptists taking it for granted, that the church of
Rome is not the church of God, they cast away the baptism there received, and
profess to begin all anew, and therefore are again baptized anew, and so
proceed on in their course, as best likes themselves: being therein more
hardened by others, who also say, that the Church of Rome is not the church of
God, neither their baptism true baptism, but an Idol, and lying sign, a
cursed and detestable Sacrament, etc. Thus errors and evils increase on all
hands: whereas the way, both soundly to answer the Papists, and rightly to
prevent the Anabaptists errors and evil courses, is to answer, that the church
of Rome, is yet still the church of God, but in apostasy; the temple of God,
but wherein the Man of sin sits, etc. And therefore as it is the church
and Temple of God, to acknowledge it, to reteyn the baptism, and whatsoever
ordinance or truth of God, they have yet among them: but as it has the man of
sin set therein, as it is in apostasy from the faith, worship, order and
government, wherein at first it was set (as may sufficiently appear by
comparing their present estate, with the Epistles written by the Apostle to
the Romans, and the other Primitive Churches, etc) so to leave and witness
against all the apostasy, iniquity, mixtures and corruptions thereof: and to
return to the ancient and good way, wherein the Church of Rome with the
other Churches aforesaid were first planted by the Apostles. Of which point, I
shall (God willing) by other occasion speak more hereafter.

In the mean time (as I noted before) remember still to distinguish betvveen
the Temple of God, and the man of sin set therein, between the church it
self, and the apostasy thereof: like as betvveene the Temple at Jerusalem, and
the idols of abomination that were set therein, betvveen the church of Israel,
and the defection thereof. Which did not hinder, but that yet still it was the
Temple and church of God, though corrupted and defiled, so as none could
lawfully in that estate either minister there, or bring their sacrifices
thither: but the godly chose rather that Jerusalem should be filled with their
innocent blood, then that they would sin and defile themselves with the
worship and abomination there used and urged upon them. 2 King 21, 1 -- 16. and
24, 4.

Remember also still to apply unto Antichrist, what the Scripture has
otherwhere of the Beast, of the Gentiles, of Sodom, Egypt, Babylon, etc. And
refer what it has of the temple of God, of the court of the temple, of the
holy City, and the like, to the church of God, either more sincere, or more
corrupt, in defection, or otherwise. Consider withal, if whereas the terms
of a true or false Church are commonly used, and many times not rightly
understood or applied, it would not be good and profitable for discerning of
the different estate of Churches aright, to use the terms of sincere, Esai. 1,
21.
or corrupt; pure, or impure; entire, or apostate; faithful, or adulterate,
etc. And these also with degrees: as some more sincere, and some less; some
more corrupt, and some less, etc. Which being well observed, would give
great light, for understanding and observing things aright, both for judgment
and practice: to eschew the errors and evils into which so many fall, some on
the right hand, and some on the left.

Finally, the due observation of these things, vvil show us both why and how
to leave the present estate and apostasy of the church of Rome, and to return
to the ancient estate and integrity thereof: reteyning whatsoever they have
that is the Lords, according to his word; and renouncing whatsoever mixtures
or corruptions they have brought in of their own, whether concerning the
faith, or the order of the church. This also (I trust) may be a means, by the
blessing of God, to stir up both Papists, Anabaptists, and others that are
any way so inclined, more carefully to consider their ways and estate in
their heart, and speedily to turn their feet into the way and testimonies of
the Lord. Psalm. 119, 59, 60. Which grace the Lord in mercy vouchsafe unto them.
And thus much touching the church of Rome, and the matters aforesaid perteyning
thereunto.

Touching the Church of England.
Now whereas our opposites hold also, that the church of England is not the
church of God, nor has the covenant of God; and the Baptism there received is
not true baptism, but an idol, and lying sign, etc. their opinions are here
again in many respects far more erroneous, and ungodly then before. For how
ever some heretofore not regarding aright the faith there professed, and
lothing the corruptions there retained, have misconceived some things
concerning them and their estate: Yet now that there has been longer time and
more occasion further to consider thereof; seeing also into what extremities
diverse of our countrymen that are become Anabaptists have by this means the
more run themselves; and specially considering the doctrine of faith which they
profess in Christ alone unto salvation: it should teach al, more advisedly and
heedfully to regard their estate in this behalf, and to acknowledge them to be
the people and churches of God, having the covenant and baptism of the Lord,
etc. To insist further upon particular reasons hereabout, I need not: diverse
have been noted Page 30, etc. and 58 etc. and 121. etc.
here before: where we have also shevved, that even the church of Rome, is the
church and Temple of God: as Judah likewise and Israel of old were in the
time of their apostasies. How much more then should we so esteem of the church
of England (yea and of the Lutherans) who have in so many things now left the
apostasy of the church of Rome, and have received the doctrine of
justification by faith in Christ alone, with many other precious doctrines of
truth, that are yet still miserably depraved and corrupted among the Papists.

But hereupon some object and say, If they be the church of God, none may leave
them; it is schism for any to leave those that are the churches and people of
God; and why then do you not continue Ministers and members there still? etc.
First, to this objection I have ansvvered before, page 116, etc. To which I
refer the Reader: as also to that which M. Iunius has written concerning
this matter: as may be seen here before, page 184, 186.

Secondly, if this objection were sound, then might none leave the present
estate of the church of Rome, seeing they are the church and Temple of God, as
before has been declared. Yet the men that do thus object, have many of them
left it themselves. And M. Iunius shows, that both these may stand well
together: to esteem it to be the church of God, and yet to leave and forsake it
in their estate: yea that it is our duty so to do. But in deed (to note this
by the way) well may it be, that some Protestant writers, otherwise of great
and good judgment, have heretofore the more denied it to be the Church of God,
because they thought if that were granted, it would then follow to be schism
for any to leave it, as the Papists themselves are wont usually to object.
But the consequence is not good: as is showed before by the Scriptures and
examples both in Judah and Israel, etc. Page 116.

Thirdly, in a Church there are two things specially that are still to be
respected, the faith and the order thereof. Col. 2, 5. For touching the worship
of God therein, it may in diverse respects be referred to the one, or to the
other, or to both of them. Now for the Faith, which is in Christ alone to
salvation, we acknowledge that they profess it soundly; and in the unity
thereof we also hope our selves to be saved with them: and therefore (albeit
they entreat and deal ill with us sundry ways, yet) we hold them to be our
brethren in the Lord, and in the faith of his Gospel. But as for the churches
order, worship, and government ecclesiastical: we hold and profess, that
they stand yet still greatly corrupted, and transgressing the second
commandment, many ways: As namely, Of these more particularly see in the
Apology, and other Treatises of ours: also in the Treatise here following
touching the reformed churches.
in their Prelacie, and inferior ministry; in their Canons, Constitutions,
and Worship devised and imposed by man; especially in the Book of common
prayer, according to which all the ministers and people of that Church are
enjoined to minister and partake of the holy things of God had among them:
wherein are corruptions not a few, that are also observed and written against
The Abridgement of the Ministers book of Lincoln Diocese. The Survey of the
book of Common prayer, etc
by diverse of themselves; besides the refusal, opposition, and persecution of
the truth, which has now a long time very often and many ways benshewed
unto them, etc. And yet more specially, that the particular churches and
ministers thereof stand not, as the primitue Churches and Pastors did,
immediately under Jesus Christ the Archpastor (as touching their
ecclesiastical constitution) but under another spiritual authority and
Prelacie devised by man; neither have power in themselves (as now they stand)
to receive and practice all the ordinances of God, and to redress all errors
and corruptions, that are manifested unto them by the word of God: as the
Pastors and Churches aforesaid had. Which things standing thus, hereby may
appear, that none can stand Ministers or members of the Church aforesaid in
their estate, and perform the duties thereof according to the Laws and
Constitution thereof: but they shall sin, and transgress the second
Commandment. Which the Lord, that is a jelous God, accounts to be hatred of
him, and has threatened severely to punish: as on the contrary he has
promised to show mercy graciously to them that love him and keep his
commandments. Exodus 20, 4, 5, 6. compared with Lev. 10, 1, 2. Deuteronomy. 4, 1, 2. 2
King. 10, 18 -- 31. 2 Chronicles. 19, 2, 3. Luke 19, 27. Psalm. 119, 126, 127, 128.
Esa. 29, 13. and 65, 2. Mal. 1, 6 -- 14. Mar. 7, 4, 6, 7. etc. Col. 2, 20 --
23. Rev. 14, 9 -- 12. and 22, 18, 19.

Fourthly (which comes to a like end with the former reason, but yet will
make it more plain) there are two things concerning the worship and service
of God, which we ought always carefully to remember and observe. One, that we
ought to leave and forsake all the inventions of men, and more specially all the
mixtures and corruptions of Antichrist the man of sin, in the service and
worship of God: And this not only in things concerning the faith, but in such
also as concern the order of the church. Exodus 20, 4, 5. with Deuteronomy. 12, 32.
Judge. 8, 27. 1 Chro. 13. and 15, 2. etc. 2 Chronicles. 33, 17. Psalm. 119, 101, 113,
128. Esa. 30, 21, 22. Ezech. 43, 8. Mal. 1, 6 -- 14. Matt. 15, 9, 13, 14. Romans
16, 17. Rev. 14, 9 -- 12. and 22, 18, 19. The other is, that we observe and
practice all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, which he has (once
for all) given unto his church: whether concerning the faith, or the order of
the church: and so consequently the Churches government, worship, ministry,
and ministration of all and every of the holy things of God, according to his
word. Exodus 20, 6. compared with Deuteronomy. 12, 32. Matthew. 28, 20. Gal. 3, 15. Jude
v. 3. 1 Timothy 6, 13, 14. 2 Chronicles. 13, 8 -- 12. and 19, 8 -- 11. Psalm. 119, 101,
128. Esa. 30, 21. and 33, 22. Rev. 14, 12. Which two things, seeing that in the
present estate of the church of England neither ministers nor members can
observe them, nor be suffered peaceably so to walk: how can it be but we must
needs leave that estate, unless we should still continue in sin, against
the Law of God? And how can that justly be counted schism, which is our
bounden duty to the Lord, wherein we ought to obey God, rather then Man?

Fifthly (to make the matter yet more plain) let us put the case, that some
Kings and States would permit the Churches in their dominions peaceably to
enjoy the ministry of the word, and the Baptism of elder people among them,
but not of children: urging those words according to the letter, Make
disciples, and baptize them, Matt. 28, 19. Or if of younger persons also, yet
would not suffer any to have the Lords supper at all, because of the many
questions and troubles that have been and yet are among the Papists, Lutherans,
and other Protestants thereabout: Now hereupon I would ask, whether it
should be sin and schism to leave such an estate, and to observe also Gods
ordinance of the Lords supper, according to his institution? Or if any would
permit the use of it, but only under one kind: Or if in both kinds, to wit,
both with bread and wine, yet would not admit it without the acknowledgment
of Transubstantiation, or at least of Consubstantiation, pressing still those
words, This is my body, etc. Matthew. 26, 26. Or would not have it administered
according to the simplicity of the Gospel, but as Princes or people did
themselves like best to have it: Or admitting both preaching of the word and
ministration of the Sacraments, yet would have al, though never so profane and
notoriously wicked, to be partakers of the Lords Table, and not to be
censured, admonished, debarred, excommunicated, etc. Or would not suffer the
people to choose their own Officers, according to the word of God: or the
Officers not to perform the duties which God requires at their hands, but
at the pleasure of man, Princes or people, or at least of the greater part of
the people, urging those words, Tell the church, etc. Matthew. 18, 17. and, All
things are yours, etc. 1 Cor. 3, 21, 22, 23. Or finally and summarily, would
not suffer the Churches, the ministers, and people, to observe whatsoever
Christ has commanded, Matthew. 28, 20. but if they had the word preached, would
not suffer the seals of Gods mercy, the Sacraments, one or both to be enjoyed;
or if they had both these, would not permit the Lords discipline to be had,
the censures and sanctions of his judgment, according to his word and
instistution, etc. Whether now (I say) in these and such like cases, we should
not obey God rather then man: and whether it be schism and sin so to do?

Sixthly, the church of England it self, and all the reformed churches and
Protestants at this day, are charged by the Papists to be schismatics, for
leaving the present estate of the church of Rome. But are they therefore so in
deed? Sundry Protestant Writers have showed good reasons to the contrary:
diverse of which (being indifferently weighed) may be applied to the points
and case now treated off: (albeit withal I acknowledge great and unspeakable
difference to be between the estate of these churches: and bless God daily for
the many good things had in the church of England, and (for that they have left
the church of Rome.) For which see particularly of our own countrymen) D.
Raynolds sixth Conclusion: either in Latin, or as it is in English joined with
his Conference with Heart, page 666, 667, etc. And D. Willets Synopsis Papismi,
in fol. page 608, 609. etc.

Lastly, whereas Conformity is much urged; and such as do not conform
themselves, are charged with schism (whether they remain in that church, or
leave the present estate thereof, that they may keep the ordinances of God
according to his word:) we are still to remember, that there is a double
Conformity, touching the outward worship of God; The one is that Conformity
of rites and order, which the Lord requires and prescribes in his word; The
other is the conformity which the laws and constitutions of men ordeyn and
require. To the former, all are bound: and unto it the Lord has given his
promise. Matthew. 28, 18, 19, 20. 1 Timothy 6, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14. compared with Exodus
20, 4, 5, 6. Deuteronomy. 12, 32. Mal. 1, 7 -- 14. Where Piscator well observes, that
in the outward worship of God there is required both a conformity of rite
agreeing with the prescript of Gods commandment; and synceritie in all which
perform that worship to the Lord. Piscat. Observe. in Mal. 1, 7, etc.

To the latter, we are bound no further or otherwise then as it agrees with
the conformity prescribed by the Lord himself, because we must worship the
Lord only as he has appointed in his word, and as we have the promise of his
acceptance and blessing therewithal. For which, see the Scriptures aforesaid,
and Deuteronomy. 4, 1, 2. Psalm. 119, 101, 128. Esa. 29, 13. and 30; 21, 22. Matthew. 15,
9. Hos. 4, 15, 17. Amos 5, 4, 5. 2 Cor. 6, 14, 15, 16, 17. Col. 2, 23. Rev. 22,
18, 19. Some other things perteyning hereunto, see also before, page 116, 117,
etc. and in the third Treatise here following.

Now if any ask whether that Christians and Churches may not and ought not to
bear one with another, in their differences: of this also I have spoken here
before, page 118, and 119, etc. the brief sum whereof is this, that we may
and should so do, when the Churches and Pastors thereof professing the faith
of Christ, stand (in their ecclesiastical estate) immediately under Jesus
Christ; having liberty and power in themselves, to receive any truth, and
redres any error or evil, as they shall be persuaded thereof; and in the mean
time do not urge others to sin in their own persons, but suffer them
peaceably to practice and walk in the way and order, which the Lord has
prescribed in his word. Which if it were the estate and dealing of the
churches in England and other the like at this day, the question would (in
diverse respects) be otherwise, for esteeming of them, and vvalking with them,
then now it is.

And these are the things which I thought here to note (by this occasion)
touching the church of England, in regard of the points in question betvveen
us, and the Anabaptists, and others to much overcaried that way. Other things
there are also good to be considered off: as namely, the diverse degrees of Gods
manifesting the truth, and consuming of Antichrist with his apostasy; the
different estate and proceeding of the Angels, spoken off, Rev. 14, 6, 8, 9,
15, 17. etc. and 15. and 16 chap. etc. the difference of ordinary and
extraordinary estate and calling; the diverse consideration of spiritual, and
bodily or personal communion; the distinction of Provincial, Diocesan, and
particular churches, with the Bishops thereof; Also whether the particular
churches among them, be not become parts and members of the Diocesan and
Provincial churches, in their estate; Whether the prelates bereave not the
particular churches of many rights perteyning unto them, and more particularly
take away from them some special rights and duties of the Pastors, ruling
Elders, people, and (in some respects) of al estates generally among them:
Finally, whether such Ministers as have left the corruptions of that estate,
and live in Churches rightly established, may not yet notvvithstanding upon
occasion 1 King. 13 chap. Hos. 5, 9. and 7, 12. Amo. 7, 13 Rev. 14, 6. etc.
preach in the other churches aforesaid, both to show them their sins and
aberrations, and to teach them the truth and way of Jesus Christ, in all
things, more and more, etc. But of these things now I treat not. Only I
thought here, to note these heads in general: which may give occasion to
others and my self to consider more thereabout: although that of some of them I
shall hereafter speak somewhat more particularly, in the Treatise following,
concerning the Reformed Churches. And thus much here, of the Church of England,
by this occasion.

This suit, we entreat such as take knowledge hereof, and have access to his
Majesty and their Honors, to motion for us, and to further what in them is.
Prove. 24, 10, 11, 12. and 31, 8, 9. Ier. 38, 7 -- 13. and 30, 15 -- 18. Mat.
25, 31. etc.
Now to conclude with suit to his Majesty, and the honorable LL. my humble
suit is (as heretofore it has been) to the Kings most Excellent Majesty, that
it would please him (now after our long exile, and other manifold afflictions)
to vouchsafe us that gracious sufferance, that we may be permitted to live in
peace, under his Majesty's government, in our own native country: there to
observe all the ordinances of Christ given to his Church, without being urged
to the use or approbation of any remnants of the apostasy of Antichrist, or
other humane traditions whatsoever: we carrying our selves in all loyalty,
peace, and godliness, as becomes all faithful subjects in the Lord. Whom we
daily pray, to stablish his Highness throne in peace with much blessing, as he
did to the good kings of Judah, who (rejecting the inventions and commixtures
of Man in the faith and worship of God) were careful to admit of no religion,
nor any other thing in religion, but that only which was warranted by the
word of God: that so his Majesty may alvvay find, as they did, and as Solomon
that wise king observed, and has left recorded, that Prove. 20, 28.
mercy and truth preserve the king; and that his throne is upholden with mercy:
and Prove. 29, 14.
A king that faithfully judges the poor, his throne shall be established for
ever. Which mercy the Lord God, who is King of Kings, vouchsafe unto his
Majesty, and his Royal seed, with all increase of glory, peace, and happiness,
in this life, and for ever. Amen.

Ier. 6, 16. Thus says the Lord, Stand ye in the ways and see, and ask for
the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein: and ye shall find rest
for your souls.

Sal. Song. 1, 7, 8. The church speaks, and asks of Christ:

Tell me ( O thou whom my soul loves) where thou feedest, where thou make
thy flock to rest at noone: for why should I be Or, as one that is vayled.
as one that turns aside by the flocks of thy companions? Christ answers:

If thou know not ( O thou fairest among women) go thy way forth by the
footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kiddes beside the Shepherds tents.

Romans 15.4. Whatsoever things were written aforetime, they were afore-written
for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might
have hope.


THE SECOND TREATISE. Of some things concerning them that are called
Remonstrants.
Hitherto of these opinions of the Anabaptists, and the assertions of others
withal thereabout. Now I come to some other points, which concern not only
the Anabaptists, but such other Christians also, as are called Remonstrants or
Arminians.

CHAPTER I. Touching Gods decree of Election.
WHether God has not in Christ, before the foundation of the world, according
to the good pleasure of his will, foreordeyned some to eternal life; to be
accomplished through Christ the Mediator, to the praise of the glory of his
grace. Ephesians. 1, 3 -- 14. Act. 13, 48. Matthew. 25, 34. 2 Timothy 1, 9. 1 Pet. 1, 2
-- 5, 19, 20. Revel. 13, 8. and 21, 27. 1 These. 5, 9. Amos 9, 9, 11, 12. Mal.
1, 2. compared with Romans 8, 28, 29, 30. and 9, 11, 12, 13, 23.

Where (for the special point now in controversy) let us consider, whether
the original fountain and only cause moving God in himself hereunto, be not
the good pleasure of his will: and not the will of man; neither our faith, or
works foreseen; nor any other thing from without God himself whatsoever.

1. Because the Scripture thus teaches, in these places and the like: Ephesians.
1, 5, 9, 11. Exodus 33, 19. with Romans 9, 11, 15, 16, 21, 23. Matt. 11, 26. and
20, 15. Jam. 1, 18. 2 Timothy 1, 9. Luke 12, 32. compared with 1 Samuel 12, 22. Romans
11, 1, 2, 5, 6, 33, 34, 35, 36.

2. And otherwise, Gods election should rely and be grounded partly on man, and
not only on God himself, that he may be all in all. And so Gods decree of
election from everlasting should not be only of his own free grace, but
partly of our selves; or by reason of our faith, works, or vvorthynes foreseen:
Contrary to the Scriptures aforesaid.

3. Then also part of the glory of our salvation should be ascribed to man,
and not the whole to God alone. Neither should we have such cause of being
humbled in our selves; and of renouncing all confidence in any vvorthynes of
our own; that so we may in deed give all glory to God, as now we have.
Ephesians. 1, 3 -- 6. Romans 9, 11, 16, 23, 36. 1 Cor. 3, 26 -- 31. and 4, 7. with
Ier. 9, 23, 24. Joh. 16, 14.

4. Otherwise also our election should not be altogether certain and
unchangeable, as now it is, inasmuch as it is grounded only upon God, with
whom is no change or shadow of turning: and not upon man, who is subject to
change and alteration. Romans 9, 11. and 11, 2, 5, 29. with Hos. 13, 14. Ioh.
10, 16 -- 29. 1 Pet. 1, 2 -- 5. 2 Timothy 1, 12. and 2, 19. Romans 8, 29, 30, 33,
38, 39. Mal. 3, 6. Iam. 1, 17. Numb. 23, 19. 1 Samuel 15, 29. Psalm. 102, 13, 14,
27, 28. Exodus 3, 14. Esa. 46, 10. Which is the more to be observed, because
they themselves also write, that the Saints and faithful may fall away wholly
from the grace of God, and perish for ever. So as their own opinions being
laid together, they seem to deal in this matter, much like as the Anabaptists
do in the other aforesaid: Who when the Lord himself has given us a sure
ground for the ministration of Baptism to the faithful and their children, to
wit, Gods gracious covenant and commandment: they (to exclude children from
the participation thereof) would bring us to an uncertain ground, of Man's
profession of faith and repentance. Hos. 6, 4. Matthew. 13, 20. Act. 8 13, 23. 2 Timothy 4, 10.
For although there may be good use made of such profession about other
questions touching Baptism, and the ministration thereof: yet when we inquire
of the right and sure ground hereof, we must carefully keep unto that which God
has laid himself, for the administering of his own sign and seal of his
covenant of grace, and not admit of any uncertain one relying upon man. And (to
note it by the way) it is a good thing in religion (concerning the points and
questions thereof) both for instruction and comfort unto us, still to look unto
the grounds thereof, and to observe whether they be sure and certain, as
relying on God, or doubtful and uncertain, as proceeding from man.

5. Neither else should our faith and holiness depend upon Gods election of
grace; but his election should depend upon our faith and holiness. Which is
contrary to the Scriptures: as may be seen, both touching faith, Act. 13, 38.
and 22, 14. Jam. 2, 5. with Tit. 1, 1. and touching good works and holiness of
life, Ephesians. 1, 4. and 2, 10. 2 These. 2, 13, 14. 2 Timothy 1, 9. Where the
Scripture shows, See the truth hereof also, in another case, touching Gods
dealing with Zerubbabel; Hag. 2, 23.
that our faith and holiness follovv after Gods election, as fruits thereof: and
go not before it, as causes thereof. Also, that they are means and ways by
which God will bring us to salvation in Christ; but not the fountain and cause
of our election, to the Lord himself. By which may also appear, that the
doctrine of predestination does not any way hinder faith or good works (as is
objected:) but in deed stirs up and incourageth thereunto: inasmuch as
although unto God they are not the cause of our election, yet to our selves
they are a good assurance thereof, seeing they are fruits proceeding thereof:
and are also means which it pleases God to use, and the way wherein he
would have us to walk, to salvation in Christ, and the glory of his Name, for
ever. Whereof therefore we should be so much the more careful, as we are
desirous to glorify God, and to have our calling and election to life
eternal, assured unto our selves. 2 Pet. 1, 1 -- 10. Romans 8, 28, 29, 30. Mat.
5, 16. and 25, 34, 35, etc.

6. Moreover how else is it true, that babes and little children are heirs of
the blessing of God, and perteyn to the kingdom of heaven: and therefore also
to Gods eternal election of grace? Mar. 10, 13 -- 16. Luke 18, 15, 16. Romans 5,
14, 15. and 8, 33. and 9, 11. and 11, 1 -- 7. Matt. 18, 2, 10. and 19, 13, 14,
15. with Heb. 1, 14. For upon the other opinions would follovv, either that
God has elected no infants to salvation, but that they are all rejected and
reprobate: or that infants (as well as elder people) have that repentance,
faith, and perseverance in godliness: which is required by the Opposites to be
in all that are chosen by God unto life eternal. Whereas many of them dye in
their infancy, and some the first month, or first day they are borne: and yet
are partakers of Gods grace, and inheritors of his kingdom in Christ: as is
aforesaid.

7. Finally, there are also elect Angels, asvvell as elect men: and the like
cause in God of his election of both: to wit, the good pleasure of his will.
Else should not the vvil of God be the ground and rule of al righteousness; nor
God himself be al in all, Christ being the head of all principality and power,
as the Scripture shows. 1 Timothy 5, 21. compared with Ephesians. 1, 11. Col. 1, 16
-- 19. and 2, 10. Job. 38, 7. Revel. 5, 11, 12, 13. Ephesians. 3, 10. Exodus 33, 19.
Psalm. 115, 1, 3. Revel. 19, 10. with 1, 1. Heb. 1, 14. and 12, 22. Matt. 22,
30. Luke 20, 35, 36. Romans 11, 36.

Seeing therefore the Scripture teaches, that the election of God, is
according to the good pleasure of his own will: seeing also it is grounded on
God and not on Man; being certain and unchangeable; of the free grace and gift
of God; to the glory and praise of his grace; causing and going before our
faith and holiness of life; making Infants partakers of the kingdom of heaven;
and having the like cause, as is of the choice of the elect Angels: let us
therefore with the Scriptures, and according thereunto, acknowledge that the
fountain and original cause of our election, is only the will and good
pleasure of God, to the praise of his Name and glory of his grace, for ever.

Hereunto also agree some sayings of the ancient Writers. As when Augustine
says, Christ chose us, not because we believe, but that we might believe:
least we should be said, first to have chosen him; and that should be false
which he said, You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you. August. de
predest. sanctorum. lib. 1, Ioh. 15, 16
cap. 17, and 19.

And again, I see that the Father also loved us before, not only before Christ
dyed for us, but before he made the world: the Apostle himself being witness,
who says, Ephesians. 1, 4.
As he has chosen us in him, before the foundation of the world. August. de
Trinitat. l. 13, cap. 11.

Fulgentius also testifies that there is not in the Saints any cause of Gods
Predestination, but only the good will of God. Fulgent. ad Marinum lib. 1. And
thus much of the Decree of Gods election.

CHAPTER II. Touching Gods Decree of Reprobation.
Whether God has not of old, according to his own will, good pleasure, and
purpose, passed by some in his election of grace, and appointed them to wrath
and condemnation, to be accomplished through their own desert, for the
declaration of his glory. Jude, ver. 4, and 6. Romans 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18.
with Exodus 9, 16. Mal. 1, 3. Matt. 11, 25.26. and 25, 41. 2 Pet. 2.4, 12. 1
Pet. 2, 8. Ioh. 3, 18, 19, 36. and 10, 26. 2 Cor. 4, 3, 4. Prove. 16, 4. Romans 2,
5. and 9, 19 -- 22. and 11, 33 -- 36.

Where again let us consider, whether the very cause moving God hereunto, be
not his own will, good pleasure, and purpose in himself: and not the will,
or abuse of free will in the creatures, neither unbelief, or other sins of
any foreseen.

1. Because the Scripture thus teaches in these and the like places: Romans 9,
11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. and 11, 33 -- 36. compared with Genesis 25,
23. Mal. 1, 3. Exodus 9, 16. Matthew. 11, 25, 26. and 20, 15.

2. And otherwise, the moving cause hereof should not be in God himself, but
from without him. Contrary to the Scriptures aforesaid, and to the infinite,
eternal, and unchangeable nature of God.

3. Neither else should there be in general, one and the same cause of Gods
decree, for election, and for reprobation: and that also both of Angels, and of
men: as there is one Decreer of both, from all eternity, to the glory of his
Name for ever. Romans 9, 11, 12, 13, 18, 22, 23. 1 These. 5, 9. Mat. 11, 25, 26.
and 20, 15. and 25, 41. 2 Pet. 2, 4, 12. Prove. 16, 4. Romans 11, 33 -- 36.

4. Else also we do not in very deed acknovvledge the will of God to be the
ground and rule of all righteousness, in this, as in all other of his actions:
how ever they seem strange unto flesh and blood, which can not comprehend them.
Romans 9, 18. Psalm. 115, 3. Esa. 14, 24 -- 27. and 28, 29. and 46, 9, 10, 11.
Ezech. 1, 4, etc. Psalm. 92, 5. Matthew. 11.25.26. and 20, 15.

5. Moreover, If sin foreseen, be the cause of Reprobation, then it is either
original, or actual sin. But not original sin, because then all men
being so borne, should be reprobate. Neither actual sin: first, because then
no infants, no not of the Turks or Heathens, that dye in their infancy, should
be reprobate: secondly, because that then on the other hand, all of years
should be reprobate and rejected, seeing all such sin actually: as the
Scripture teaches, and al vvil acknovvledge. 1 King. 8, 46. Psalm. 14, 2, 3.
Romans 3, 9 -- 19. Eccles. 7, 20.

6. Besides, if unbelief or other sin foreseen should be the cause of
Reprobation, then should also faith and holiness foreseen be the cause of Gods
election. But this is not so: as was shevved here before: p. 221, etc.

7. Finally, why else should the Apostle so sharply rebuke, such as make vain
and odious objections hereabout, as he does, when he says, O man, who art
thou that reply against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed
it, Why have thou made me thus? Has not the potter power over the day, of the
same lump, to make one vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor? What
if God vvilling to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured
with long suffering the vessels of wrath, fitted to destruction? and that he
might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he
has before prepared unto glory? Romans 9, 20 -- 23. And how greatly again does
the same Apostle admire and reverendly adore Gods dealing herein (teaching us
by his example so to do, as he does) saying: O the depth of the riches both of
the wisdom and knowledge of God? how unsearchable are his judgments, and his
ways past traceing out? For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor? Or who has first given to him, and it shall be recompensed
unto him again? For of him, and through him, and to him are all things: to
whom be glory for ever. Amen. Romans 11, 33 -- 36.

SOME OBJECTIONS AND ANSWERS.
Object. I. But this opinion and doctrine makes God to be the first cause and
author of all sin.

Ansvv. Not so: For first, the elect also sin, and not the Reprobate only.
And Gods decree of reprobation perteyneth only to the Reprobate, and not to
the elect. Another cause therefore there is, and must needs be of sin, both
in the elect and reprobate: namely, the abuse of free will in Adam, in whom
all have sinned, and of whom all are descended, both the elect and reprobate:
and since Adams fall, man's natural corruption, and his corrupt will and
concupiscence. Genesis 3, 1 -- 6. and 5, 3. compared with Romans 5, 12 -- 19. Jam.
1, 13 -- 17. Eccles. 7, 29. Ephesians. 2, 3.

2. Secondly, we are to distinguish between the action, and the corruption, of
sin: Also, betvveen sin, and the punishment of sin. Sin (as sin) and
the corruption thereof, is of man, who being made righteous, transgressed
vvittingly and willingly. (For which see the Scriptures aforesaid, and the
like.) But as it is an action, the ability to do this or that is of God, in
whom we live, and move, and have our being. Act. 17, 21. also as it is the
punishment of sin, it is justly inflicted by the Lord, who is just to punish
sin. Thus God hardneth the heart of Pharaoh, Exodus 4, 21. and 9, 12, 16.
with Romans 9, 17, 18. and Pharaoh hardneth it himself, Exo. 8, 15, 32. and 9,
34. Which, as Pharaoh does it, is sin: as God does it, it is the punishment
of sin. And thus it has the consideration of good, for declaration of the
justice of God. For God is just in all his ways, and holy in all his works.
Psalm. 145, 17. and his understanding is infinite, which man may admire, but
cannot comprehend. Psa. 147, 5. and 77, 19. with Romans 11, 13-36.

3. Thirdly, distinguish also betvveen effects, and consequents. Sins come
after Gods decree of Reprobation, not as effects thereof, but as co^sequents
that follovv after it. It is most holy, and so not the cause of sin.

4. Neither is it sound to say, because God suffers this or that, therefore
he does it. Difference is to be put between Gods decree of permission, which
concerns all; and between Gods decree of Reprobation, which respects only
some, to wit, the Reprobate. Besides, all know, that men suffer many things,
which they do not, nor can be said to do, nay which many times they forbid.
And the cause of an action (rightly and properly considered) is in the doer,
not in the sufferer.

5. Otherwise, let it be observed, whether these men themselves do not in deed
by their opinions make God the author of sin, and of evil and destruction:
who hold, that God would have all and every particular man whosoever to be
saved; and cannot deny, but he is able to save all whom he is vvilling to
save; and yet also grant (as the truth is) that he does not save all. What now
vvil follow hereupon, according to their assertions, let them consider with
themselves.

6. Finally, God is so far from being author of sin (as it is sin) as he
hates, forbids, and condemns it: which his word every where, and his
works at all times make manifest.

Object. II. But the Lord says by Ezekiell, I will not the death of the
wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Ezec. 18, 23, 32. and
33, 11.

Ansvv. 1. The Lord is not contrary to himself, who says by the same Prophet,
As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire
for fuel: so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and I will set my
face against them: they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall
devour them: and you shall know that I am the Lord, when I set my face
against them. Ezec. 15, 6, 7. Where the Prophet shows, that as the vine tree
is by Gods framing and disposition of it, given to be fevvell for the fire: so
also the Jews and inhabitants of Jerusalem were then by the special decree
of God appointed to the fire and destruction.

2. The Prophet speaks of temporary death, as may appear by Ezech. 33, 11,
25, 28. and 18, 2, 13, 27. compared with chapt. 12, and 13, and 14, and 15,
etc. whereas the question is about reprobation to eternal death. And great
difference there is, betvveen these two: as may be seen in the cases of Naboth
and the Blasphemer (spoken of, Lev. 24.) who were both of them stoned to
death. Lev. 24, 14 -- 21. and 1 King. 21, 1 -- 13. Also in Josiah and Achab,
who were both slain in battle. 1 King. 22, 34, 35. and 2 Chronicles. 35, 20 --
24. These now had a like bodily and violent death: but shall we therefore match
them together as like, touching eternal death?

3. Difference also is to be put betvveene the revealed, and the hidden will
of God, so to call it. As may be observed in the Lords dealing with Abraham,
Ezechiah, and others. God bids Abraham take Isaac his son, and sacrifice
him: yet Gods purpose was but thus to try Abraham's faith and obedience:
which purpose of God was as yet concealed from Abraham, till God did afterward
manifest it. Genesis 22, 1, 2. etc. The Lord also bids Esaiah go tell
Hezekiah, that he should then dye: when God notwithstanding does afterward
add fifteen years more to his life: which as yet was concealed from Hezekiah.
Esa. 38, 1. etc. Yet this double will (so to call it) is but in respect of us,
and the manifestation thereof unto us. For otherwise in respect of God himself,
he never would any other thing, but that which also he does.

4. Again, difference is to be put between willing as delighting with, and
willing as decreing. Otherwise if God simply would not, none should die at al.

5. Observe vvithal, whether in the places aforesaid the Prophet speak not of
the wicked converting to the Lord; and not of the Reprobate (whereabout the
question now is:) For which, consider that which is written in Ezech. 18,
21, 22, 27, 28, etc.

6. Finally, the right translation and understanding here is thus: Or, I am not
delighted with.
I have no pleasure (says the Lord) in the death of the wicked, etc. Whereupon
observe again, that God delights not in the death of a sinner (in one
respect) as it is the destruction of his creature, Ezech. 18, 23. and 33, 11.
But he delights in it (in another respect) as it is his just punishment of
sin. Psalm. 37, 13. with 2, 4, 5, 12. Prove. 1, 26. Ezech. 21, 17. And here
see Piscat. in Ezech. 18, 23, 32. and 33, 11. Also Piscat. Resp. ad duas
disputat. Taufreri, and Resenij, page 38, and 100.

Object. III. But the doctrine of Gods predestination, especially of
Reprobation, should not be taught, or at least not be taught unto the common
people, etc.

Ansvv. 1. Why then does the Scripture teach it: the Prophets, Apostles, and
Christ himself? The Prophets, Genesis 25, 23. with Romans 9, 12. Exodus 9, 16. and
33, 19. with Romans 9, 15, 17, 18. Ier. 6, 30. Mal. 1, 2, 3. with Romans 9, 13.
Prove. 16, 4. where it is expressly said, that the Lord has made all things
for himself; yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. And Christ himself
also teaches the same, when he says, or, I confess to thee
I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou have hid these
things (the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven) from the wise and prudent,
and have revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in
thy sight. Mat. 11, 25, 26. Where it is evident, that Gods decree, not only of
election, but of reprobation also, depends merely on Gods good will and
pleasure. Also, Matt. 13, 11. And again, when he says in his prayer to the
Father, Those that thou have given me, I have kept, and none of them is lost,
but the son of perdition: meaning Judas. John 17, 12. Like as Antichrist also
is called, the son of perdition, 2 These. 2, 3. that is, appointed to
perdition and condemnation: As by the sons of death, is understood also such,
as are appointed to dye. Psalm. 79, 11. and 102. 20. And the Apostles teach it
in like sort: namely, the Apostle Paul, Romans 9, 11 -- 23. and 11 chap. 2 Timothy
2, 19, 20. Ephesians. 1, 3 -- 11. 1 These. 5, 9. where the Apostle having said, Let
us not sleep, as do others: but let us that are of the day, be sober, putting
on the brestplate of faith and love, and for an helmet, the hope of salvation:
then presently annexeth: For God has not appointed us to wrath: but to
obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ. And Peter likewise, who teaches
out of the Prophets, that Christ is a stone of stumbling, and a rock of
offense, to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient, whereunto also
they were appointed. 1 Per. 2, 8. And Jude the Apostle, saying, There are
certain men crept in unavvares, who were of old foreordeyned to this
condemnation, etc. Jude ver. 4. Thus do the Prophets, Apostles, and Christ
himself, plainly and purposely teach this doctrine. And should not then the
ministers of Christ tread in their steps, being still careful to teach it
wisely, and soundly according to the Scriptures? For whatsoever things are
written aforetime, they were written for our learning, that we through
patience, and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope. Romans 15, 4.

2. Moreover, this doctrine is both lawful, and good to be taught in the
church: 1. Because it glorifyeth God, ascribing and yielding to God, the glory
of his mercy, justice, wisdom, and power over all. Ioh. 16, 14. Romans 9, 22,
23. and 11, 33 -- 36. II. Because it stirs up to holiness of life, prayer,
thanksgiving, good works, searching and relying on the word of God, etc. 1
These. 5, 6 -- 9. Mat. 11, 25, 26. Act. 4, 24 -- 28. etc. Ephesians. 1, 3, 12. and
2, 10. Romans 15, 4. 2 Timothy 3, 15, 16, 17. 2 Pet. 1, 3 -- 10. III. Because it
assures us of the certainty of our salvation, being grounded in the eternal
and unchangeable counsel of God: It teaches us to cast off all confidence in
our selves, and to ascribe our salvation only to the grace of God,
acknowledging and admiring the riches of Gods mercy, who of his free grace
has chosen us to life and salvation in Christ: It comfort us against
distrust, despair, and other manifold tentations, arising by means of
troubles and adversities that befall us in this life, teaching us in all things
patiently to rest in the work of God: and particularly, it strengthens us
against the grief and offense, that otherwise we might take at the iniquity
and evil dealing of hypocrites and other wicked persons, in the church, or out
of the church: in as much as we know, that God is the disposer of all things,
and that they come to pass according to his eternal and most certain and
determinate counsel, who therefore will work all things for good unto us in
Christ. 2 Timothy 2, 19, 20. Romans 8, 28 -- 39. and 11, 33 -- 36. 2 Samuel 16, 10,
11. and Job 1, 21. Mat. 11, 25, 26. and 20, 15. John 17, 12. Act, 2, 23. and 4,
27, 28. 1 Pet. 2, 6, 7, 8. Jude ver. 3, and 4. Rev. 13, 8. and 17 8. and 20,
15. and 21, 27.

3. It gives us good and necessary occasion, to put difference between Gods
decree of election and reprobation, which was before all beginning, and
betvveen the execution thereof, which succedeth in time afterward. And
thereupon to observe, that many things come betvveen the decree it self, and
the execution thereof: which are due means and causes of the latter, that are
not at all any causes of the former. Romans 8, 29, 30. 1 Pet, 1, 2, 18, 19, 20.
and 2, 6 -- 10. Mat. 11, 25, 26. Act. 13, 48. and 14, 16. Psalm. 81, 12. Esa 29,
10. Romans 11, 2, 5 -- 10.33 -- 36.

Some testimonies of ancient Writers.
Iustine Martyr says, God is not in the cause, that such as are predestinate
are unjust, whether Angels or men, but every one by his own fault is such a
one, as he shall appear. Justin. Martyr. in Dialogo cum Tryphone Iudaeo.

Augustine says, They seek to know the causes of the will of God: when as the
will of God, is it self the cause of al things that are. For if the will of God
have a cause, then there is some thing that goes before the will of God: which
is wicked to believe. August. tom. 1. lib. 1. de Genes. contra Manichaeos, cap.
2.

And moreover, In them that were not yet borne, and as yet had not done any
thing, there could not be any regard of deserts: etc. But if it be said, that
their conversation to come made the difference in the judgment of God, then
surely that shall be made of no effect, which the Apostle spoke before, saying:
Not of works. Romans 9, 11.
But seeing he says generally, Not of works: there he would also have works
past, and to come, to be understood: to wit, works past, which were none at
all, and works to come, which were not as yet. Ibid. tom. 7. lib. de Predest.
and Gratia. cap. 7.

And again, How then said he unto these, you are not of my sheep? Ioh. 10, 26.
Because he savv, that they were predestinate to eternal destruction, not
prepared to life eternal by the ransom of his blood. Ibid. tom. 9. tractat.
in Iohannem, 48.

Isidorus also says, There is a double or two fold Predestination: either of
the elect unto rest, or of the reprobate unto death. Isidor. de summo bono,
lib. 2, cap. 6.

And Fulgentius says, The wicked are predestinate unto the second death of
the soul, that is, to the lake of fire and brimstone. Fulgent. ad Monimum,
lib. 1. cap. 27. And hitherto concerning Gods decree of Election and
Reprobation.

CHAPTER III. Touching general Redemption.
Whether Christ have not by his death, (according to the counfess and decree
of God) redeemed only the elect from their sins, and from the wrath of God
due thereunto: and not all, and every one in the world (none excepted)
therefrom. Esa. 53 chapter compared with Romans 8, 33, 34. 1 These. 1, 10. Psalm. 16,
2, 3, 4. etc. with Act. 2, 25 -- 36. Matt. 1, 21. and 26, 28. with Dan. 9, 24
-- 27. 1 Cor. 5, 7. with Exodus 12, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14. Joh. 10, 15. Ephesians. 1, 4
-- 14. and 5.23.25. Tit. 2, 13, 14. Heb. 2, 10, 17. and 9, 22, 24, 28. and 13,
20. 1 Pet. 1, 2, 3, 4, 18 -- 21. Revel. 21, 27.

1. Because they that are redeemed from their sins by the death of Christ,
are also delivered from the wrath to come; and in Christ are justified,
quickened, and begotten again to a living hope by his resurrection from the
dead, to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away,
being reserved in heaven for us. 1 These. 1.10. Romans 8.33.34. and 4.25. with
Esa. 53 chap. and Ephesians. 2.5.6. 1 Pet. 1.2.3.4. Which grace is peculiar only
to the elect, and not to all in the world whosoever. As appears by the
Scriptures here noted before in the general Position, and many other the like
in the word of God.

2. The Prophets teach us, that the righteousness which now Christ has brought
in, is an everlasting righteousness: whereas that which Adam had at the first,
was quickly lost and foone gone. Dan. 9.24. with Eccles. 7.29. Psalm. 49.12.20.
And the Apostles teach us, that the Redemption which Christ has obtained for
us by his death, is an eternal Redemption. Eternal (I say) not only in
respect of the typical or temporal Redemption and reconciliation made by the
Priests in Israel; but also in regard of the fruit and benefit, whereof the
redeemed are in deed made partakers to eternal righteousness and salvation, by
Jesus Christ. Heb. 9.12. with ver. 24, 28. and Dan. 9.24 -- 27. Romans
8.23.29.30. Luke 21, 28. Psalm. 16.3 -- 11 and 130.7.8. Ezec. 43.18 -- 27. with
Hebr. 1.3.14. and 2.5 -- 9.10.11*17.18. and 4.14.15.16. and 5.9.10. and 6.17 --
20. and 10.14. and 13.10.11.12.20.21. Ephesians. 1.4.7.14. 1 Pet. 5.10, 1 Cor.
1.30.31. Where yet further to this end may be considered, how the Scripture
speaking of our Redemption, does by this word sometimes mean the price and
ransom which Christ has paid and answered for us unto God; sometimes our
full enjoining of the fruit and effect thereof in eternal glory. Ephesians. 1,
7.14. 1 Cor. 1, 30. 1 Pet. 1, 18, 19. with Luke 21, 28. Romans 8.23. Like as the
word Regeneration may sometimes be understood of our new birth that is begun
in this life; sometimes of our whole and full renewing to the enjoying of
eternal glory in the life to come, Tit. 3, 5. and John 3, 3. 1 Pet. 1, 3, 4.
with Mat. 19, 28. and Act. 3, 21. 2 Pet. 3, 13. Wherein we may also observe,
how they which are partakers of the one, shall likewise be partakers of the
other. As whom the Lord once loves, and accepts in his beloved Son Jesus
Christ, them he loves to the end. Romans 8, 37, 38, 39. and 9, 11, 13. with
Mal. 1, 2. Ephesians. 1, 5, 6. and 5, 2, 25 -- 27. Ier. 31, 3. and John 13, 1. and
15, 13. with 10, 15, 16, 17, 27, 28. So as then, if all and every one in the
world (without exception of any) be redeemed by the death of Christ, it would
follow that all should be saved, having an eternal righteousness and
redemption, and being made partakers of the love of God, and regeneration, to
eternal life. And so the Reprobate should be redeemed and saved, asvvell as
the elect, and the unrepentant, unbelevers, and most wicked in the world,
should be partakers of eternal redemption, righteousness and salvation by
Christ, asvvell as the repentant, and the believers, and most godly that ever
were. Which is against the whole course of the Scriptures throughout.

3. Besides that such general redemption cannot stand, with that uncessant
and unreconciliable enmity, which God himself, upon the fall of man, did put
between the seed of the serpent, and the seed of the woman. Genesis 3, 15. By the
seed of the serpent, I understand (with Piscat. in Genesis 3, 15. etc.
others) the wicked and reprobate, who are of their father the devil: as
Christ shows, John 8, 44. and by the seed of the woman, Christ himself
specially, and in Christ all the faithful and elect, that come of that our
first mother Eva, there spoken off. 1 John 3, 7, 8, 9. Heb. 2, 11.14, 15. Romans
16, 20. Gal. 4, 4, 5. 1 Cor. 15, 54 -- 57. Now if since the fall, Christ has
redeemed all in the world, whosoever, even the wicked and reprobate, then has
there ben a reconciliation made again between the parties aforesaid; and that
enmity between them taken away: (for Christ is the Lamb, slain from the
foundation of the world, Rev. 13, 8. Hebr. 13, 8.) And so the counsel and
work of God should be infringed, touching that hostile and perpetual enmity,
which the Lord himself said, he would put between the seed of the serpent,
and the seed of the woman, as is aforesaid. But this cannot stand, with the
unchangeablenes of Gods counsel, or truth of his word. And therefore is
erroneous. Not to speak of that confirmation thereof, which the continual
experience of all ages, and even of this generation, wherein we live at this
day, may afford.

4. And if we look at Israel, we may observe, that in the Tabernacle and
Temple there were two Altars: the one called the brazen Altar, for the burnt
offering and sacrifice; the other the golden Altar, for the burning of incense
thereupon. At both which, the Priests (as types of Jesus Christ) ministered in
Israel. The one more specially typing out the Redemption wrought by Christ,
the other his Intercession. Exodus 27, 1 -- 8. and 30, 1 -- 8. Ezech. 40, 47.
and 41, 22. and 43, 13 -- 27. compared with Heb. 13, 10, 11, 12. Revel. 8, 3,
4. By which, as we may learn against the Papists, that Jesus Christ is our
Redeemer at the brazen altar (on whom alone we are to rely for salvation;)
and our Intercessour at the golden altar (on whom alone also we are to rely
for the mediation of his Intercession for us, and not upon the Angels or Saints
departed:) so likewise for the question in hand, we may furthermore learn this
withal, that Jesus Christ is Redeemer only for them, for whom he is
Intercessour. And Intercessour he is only for the Elect and faithful; and not
for the world, the Reprobate and wicked therein. As Christ himself, and the
Prophets and Apostles do teach us. Ioh. 17, 9, 20, 24. Psalm. 16, 3, 4. with
Act. 2, 25 -- 36. Esa. 53, 12. Romans 8, 33, 34. Heb. 9, 24. Rev. 8, 3, 4.
Therefore also he is the Redeemer only of the elect, and not of the world, the
wicked and reprobate whosoever. Which is yet further confirmed unto us, by the
very names and titles, which in the Scriptures are attributed to Christ
agreably hereunto: as namely, that he is called Jesus, Christ, the Savior, the
Anointed one; the Author, Captain, and finisher of our faith and salvation;
the great shepherd of the sheep; the shepherd and Bishop of our souls; the
Father of eternity; the Prince of peace; the Angel of the covenant; the Sun
of righteousness; the comfort of Israel; and eternal life, etc. Mat. 1, 21,
22, 23. and 16, 16. Act. 2, 36. Heb. 2, 10. and 12, 2. and 13, 20. 1 Pet. 2,
25. 1 John 4, 14. Esa. 7, 14. and 9, 6. 1 Timothy 2, 5. Mal. 3, 1. and 4, 2. Luke
2, 25. 1 Ioh. 5, 12.20.

5. Hither also may be referred, that as the Passover of old was instituted
and killed for Israel only, and not for the Egyptians: so Christ our
Passover was ordained and sacrificed only for his Israel and chosen people,
and not for the wicked and all in the world whosoever, none excepted. Exodus
12. chap. 2 Chronicles. 30. and 35. Ezr. 6, 19 -- 22. compared with 1 Cor. 5,7. and
Romans 8, 33, 34. 1 Pet. 1, 2, 18, -- 21. 1 John 5, 19, 20.

6. Christ by his death has redeemed those only, for whom the Lords pleasure
prospers in his hand: whom also he makes to be his seed, and him to be the
chastisement of their peace, to be healed with his stripes. Esa. 53, 5, 10.
with 1 Pet. 2, 24, 25. Which fruit and effect is only in the elect, and not in
all whosoever: as all will confess. Otherwise also we should extend the
redemption of Christ, further then God himself (who gave him to death for us)
intended it: and contrary to the Scriptures, which apply it only to some, and
not to all and every one in the world whosover. Psa. 16, 2, 3, 4. etc. with
Act. 2, 25 -- 36. Esa 9, 6, 7. and 53, 4 -- 67. Ier. 23, 5, 6. Dan, 9 24 -- 27.
Joel 2, 33. Mic. 5, 2. Mal. 4, 2. Mat. 1, 21. and 20, 28. and 26, 28. Luke 19,
9, 10. Romans 8, 33, 34. Heb. 9, 28. and 10.14. and 13, 10, 11, 12, 20, 21, 1
Ioh, 5, 4, 12, 13, 19, 20.

7. Christ laid down his life only for his sheep. Joh. 10, 11, 15, 16. and
15, 19. Heb. 13, 20. 1 Pet. 2, 24, 25. And therefore not for all in the world,
seeing all are not his sheep. Joh. 10, 26. Mat. 25, 33. etc.

8. Christ dyed to confirm the covenant of Gods grace, for eternal salvation
unto his people. Dan. 9, 24 -- 27. Gal. 3, 13 -- 18. Heb. 9, 15, 16. and 13,
20, 21. Mal. 3, 1. and 4, 2. with Mat. 1, 21. and 26, 27, 28. And therefore
only for them that are the heirs of salvation. For which, see the Scriptures
and reasons aforesaid. Now whereas Daniell speaking of the Messiah, says he
should be cut off, and bring in everlasting righteousness, and confirm the
covenant with Many, Piscat. resp. ad disp. Taufren p. 73. etc.
etc. Dan. 9, 24 -- 27. two things there are, about the word (Many) well
observed by some vvriters: which here I will mention. One is, that if we do
thus translate and understand the word Many, then we must remember, that the
elect and godly (for the number of them) are to be considered two ways:
either in comparison with others; or simply in themselves. The elect and godly,
in comparison of the reprobate and ungodly, are few, and the lesser number.
Mat. 7, 13, 14. and 20, 16. and 22, 14. Romans 9, 27, Piscat. in Dan. 9, 27.
28, 29. with Esa. 1, 9. and 10, 22, 23. But being considered in themselves,
the elect and faithful are many, and the number of them very great Mat. 20, 28.
Heb. 9, 28. with Esa. 53, 11, 12. Rev. 7, 4 -- 9. The other thing is, that the
word here translated (Many) may also be translated the excellent, the great,
the noble, glorious, honorable, etc. as the same word is by Daniell (in the
singular number) used and applied to God, when he calls him the great God,
Dan. 2, 45. and by others also is used, when they speak of men, or other
things, that are great or excellent: as in Job. 32, 9. Ier. 41, 12. Hos. 8, 12.
and so likewise may be understood, in Esa, 53, 11. And thus it agrees with
David's speech ( Psa. 16.) where (using another word) he brings in Christ
speaking to God the Father, thus: My goodness extends not to thee, but to the
Saints which are on earth, and to the excellent; in whom is all my delight,
Psalm. 16, 2, 3, etc. By which Psalm also we may learn (for the question in
hand) that the benefit of Christ's redemption and mediation, is not to be
extended to Idolaters, unbelevers, or other like wicked persons (verse. 4.) but
only to those in whom Christ delights, that is, to the Saints, that are
great, excellent and noble, being made the sons of God in Christ ( ver. 3.
with 1 Ioh. 3, 1. and Joh. 1, 12.) For whom Christ dyed, and rose again from
the dead, and is set in glory at the right hand of God, where are pleasures
for evermore. Psalm. 16. And that thus we may understand and apply this Psalm
unto Christ, and to the work of his redemption and mediation, we may learn by
the Apostles themselves, so alleging and applying it, and other psalms
accordingly. Act. 2, 25 -- 36. compared with Psalm. 16, 8 -- 11. and 110, 1. and
132, 11.

9. They whom Christ has redeemed by his death, have remission of sins
through the blood of his cross; receive the spirit of adoption of sons; are
sanctified, renewed, and made conformable to the image of Christ; are never
separated from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus; become members of
that body whereof Christ is the head and Savior; are the Saints of the High
ones, or of the high places; and have the Angels sent forth to minister for
them, as being the heirs of salvation. Ephesians. 1, 7. Col. 1, 12 -- 14. Romans 8,
15 -- 39. Gal. 4, 4 -- 7. Exodus 29, 36, 37. and Ezec. 43, 13 -- 27. with Heb.
13, 10 -- 12. and 2, 9 -- 11. and 10, 14, 19, 20. Tit. 3, 4 -- 7. Phil. 3, 10.
Ephesians. 1, 3 -- 23. and 5, 23 -- 27. Dan. 7, 13, 14, 18, 25, 27. with chapt. 9,
24 -- 27. Psalm. 91, 11 -- 16. Mat. 18, 10, 11. Heb. 1, 3, 13, 14. Of which
graces and benefits, seeing all are not partakers, but the elect and believers
only: therefore also the Redemption of Christ, and the fruit thereof,
perteyneth to these only, and not to all in the world whosoever.

10. Christ (at his first coming) was once offered, to bear the sins of
the Many, unto whom expecting him, he shall appear the second time without
sin, unto salvation. Heb. 9, 28. Which second appearance of his, seeing it
shall not be unto all for salvation, but only to the many spoken off, who are
the heirs of salvation (as may be seen, in 1 Pet. 1, 2 -- 5. Matthew. 25, 31 --
46. 1 These. 1, 10. and 2 These. 1, 6 -- 10. Tit. 2, 11 -- 14. 1 Ioh. 1, 2, 3.
and in the other Scriptures aforesaid:) therefore also Christ was offered to
bear the sins only of them, and not of all in the world, whosoever and
whatsoever they be.

Herevvith also accord sundry speeches of ancient writers. As when Ambrose
says: God knovveth what the Spirit desires, Romans 8, 26, 27.
and what is the mind of the Spirit, because he makes intercession for the
Saints: as it is written, because even the Spirit makes intercession for us.
For they for whom Christ suffered; and whom he has cleansed with his blood,
for them does the spirit also make intercession. Ambros. tom. 2. libr. 5.
epist. 23.

And Augustine: The Donatists would not agree, that by the name of the World,
the church could be signified: contrary to the words of the Apostle, who
says, 2 Cor. 5.19.
God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself: and contrary to the
words of the Lord himself, who said, The son of man came not to judge the
world, Ioh. 3, 17. and 12, 47.
but that the world through him might be saved. For the world cannot be
reconciled to God and saved by him, unless that by the name of the World, the
church be understood, which only being reconciled by him is saved. August.
tom. 7. lib. contra Donatist.

And again: He that spared not his own son, Romans 8, 32, 33. with ver. 29.30.
but delivered him up for us all: how shall he not with him also freely give
all things unto us? But to whom? To us that are foreknowne and predestined,
justified, glorified, of whom it follows, Who shall lay any thing to the
charge of Gods Elect? August. tom. 9, tractat. 45. in Johan.

Again also: How then said he unto these, ye are not of my sheep? Because he
saw they were predestinate to eternal destruction, Ioh. 10.26.
not ordained or purchased to eternal life by the ransom of his blood. Ibid.
tractat. 48. in Johan.

And Cyrill likewise: Christ is now also subject to the Father: Hebr. 9.14. 1
Pet. 1, 19, 20, 21.
yet not for all, but only for them that believe in him, for whom he offered
himself, as a lamb without ^^ot unto the Father, that he might offer them unto
God, being freed from all sin. Cyrill. Thesauri lib. 10. cap. 8.

CHAPTER IIII. Touching freewill, or power in our selves unto good, since the
fall.
Whether true conversion unto God, and saving faith in Jesus Christ, be not
the free gift of God, and the work of his grace, powerfully wrought in us, to
his praise and glory: And is not of our selves, or in the power of our
free will, as grace is offered, to receive or to refuse it, to believe or not
to believe, as we will our selves: but is wholy the free, gracious, and
powerful work of God in us, as is aforesaid. Ephesians. 1 chapter and 2, 1 -- 8, 9, 10.
Phil. 1, 29. and 2, 13. Col. 1, 12, 13, 21. 2 These. 1, 3, 11, 12. Ioh. 1, 5,
11.12, 13. and 3, 3, 6, 27. and 6, 44, 65. Act. 16, 14. and 26, 15 -- 18. Genesis
6, 3, 5. Deuteronomy. 30, 6. Job 15, 16. Psalm. 51, 5. and 100, 3. Prove. 27, 22. Ier.
31, 18, 33. Ezech. 11, 19, 20. and 16, 6. Iam. 1, 17, 18. 1 Ioh. 3, 1. Heb. 12,
2. and 13, 20, 21.

1. Because saving faith and holiness, is a fruit of Gods election of grace: and
therefore is the work of his grace and power in us, to his praise. Act. 13,
48. Ephesians. 1, 3, 4. and 2, 8, 9. Tit. 1, 1. Of which, see here before, page
222.

2. It is God that makes us, and not we our selves, to be his people, and the
sheep of his pasture. Psalm. 100, 3. Ioh. 10, 16, 27, 29. Heb. 13, 20, 21. 1
Pet. 2, 25. It is Gods work alone, who as he created us at first according to
his own image and likeness: so also creates, regenerateth, and renevveth us
again, by his Spirit in Christ, according to his image in righteousness and
holiness of truth. Genesis 1, 26, 27. with Ephesians. 4, 24. Col. 3, 10. Ier. 31, 18.
Lam. 5, 21. Even the heathens themselves acknovvledge for our natural life,
that we are the generation of God, in whom we live, and move, and have our
being (as the Apostle alleges out of their own vvritings, Act. 17, 28.) And
should not then Christians much more acknowledge, for our spiritual life, that
our new birth and regeneration is of God: that as our first generation for our
natural life, is not of our own selves, nor in our own power, to work or
hinder it; so neither our regeneration or new birth: but is the good and
powerful work of God in us, by his Spirit through Jesus Christ: to whom he
gives us, and out of whose hands none is able to take us. Psalm. 139, 14 --
16. etc. with Jam. 1, 18. Joh. 1, 11 -- 13. and 3, 3 -- 8. and 10, 28, 29. and
17, 6. Tit. 3, 3 -- 7.

3. The case and dealing of our first parents, Adam and Eve, will make the
point more clear. They, before they fell, had freedom of will and ability
unto good. But when once they had transgressed, al pronenes to evil was
found in them: but free will and power unto good, now they had not. Read and
mark the history well, as it is described by Moses, Genesis 3, 7. etc. They knew
now they were naked, not only in body, but in soul also, which was
deprived of the righteousness and holiness, which formerly they had, according to
the image of God. And what do they? They sevve fig leaves together, and
make themselves aprons. But this concerns but the body: What care was there
now of the souls nakedness? They neither seek to God: no nor when God of his
mercy comes and deals with them, do they sincerely acknovvledge their
sin, and ask mercy of the Lord, but they put it off from themselves, and
color and cloak it, what they can, etc. The Lord thus showing in them unto
all, that all which we do or can do now of our selves, since the fall, is
but to cloak and cover our sins as with fig leaves: So far are we from
having freedom of vvil and power of our selves to take, or have them taken
away: unless God renew our hearts, and vouchsafe his grace and mercy unto us
in Christ. And note vvithall, that if any sinners had freewill or power unto
good, since the fall, it should have been our first parents, who (as all
acknovvledge) had it in their integrity: whereas their posterity See here
before, page 24.
are borne in sin, according to their image, Genesis 5, 3. Psa. 51, 5. not
according to the image of God, wherein they at first were created. Genesis 1, 26,
27.

4. Christ also teaches, that no man can come unto him, except the father
dravv him, and give us unto him. Ioh. 6, 44, 65. and 10, 29. and 17, 6. It is
the Father, who makes us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the
Saints in light: who has delivered us from the power of darkness, See also Act.
26.15 -- 18. Esa. 42, 7. Zach. 9, 11 Mat. 6, 23 and Ioh. 1, 5.
and translated us into the kingdom of his dear son. Col. 1, 12, 13. Where
we may observe further to this purpose, that the word CLEROS used by the
Apostle, signifies a lot, or inheritance that comes by lot. Which also may
teach us, that this renewed estate is the Lords free gift, and his gracious
work, and disposition; and not ours: as the very nature and use of a lot does
plainly manifest. Lev. 16, 8, 9, 10. Number. 34, 13. with Ezec. 47, 13 -- 22.
Josh. 14, 2. and 15, 1. and 19, 1. Prove. 16, 33. Jonah 1, 7. Act. 1.26. and 13,
19. and 26.18. Psa. 16.5.6. Ephesians. 1, 11. with Col. 1, 12.

5. Moreover, saving faith is wrought in us by the Lord, even by the working
of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him up from
the dead. Ephesians. 1.17 -- 19.20. Col. 2, 12, 13. Therefore it neither depends
on the power of our will, nor (where God vvil work it can be overcome by the
untovvardnes and corruption thereof: but is the free gift and work of God,
effectually wrought in whom it pleases him. Ephesians. 2.8.9. Phil. 1.29. and
2.13. Joh. 1.11 -- 13. 2 These. 1.11.12. Ier. 31, 18. 2 Cor. 4.6. 2 Timothy
2.25.26. Heb. 12.2. compared with the Scriptures aforesaid.

6. They also which have saving faith in Jesus Christ, are made members of
that mystical body, whereof Christ is the head. Ephesians. 1.3 -- 22.23. and
4.15.16. Col. 1.18.19. and 2.19. 1 Cor. 12. etc. Therefore, as in the natural
body, the disposition of the members (in this or that place, to this or that
use) is not of themselves, but wholy according to the will of God, as it
pleases him to dispose them: 1 Cor. 12.18. so also in the mystical body of
Christ, the placing of the members therein, is not of our selves, or at the
will of men, but wholy according to the will and good pleasure of God. For
which see the Scriptures before alleged, and the treatise of Gods decree of
election, here spoken of before, page 221.

7. We are by nature dead (not half dead, or partly dead) in sins and
trespasses. Ephesians. 2.1.2.3.5.12.13 -- 22. Col. 2.13. Ioh. 5.25. Therefore it is
not of us, or in the power of our will, to quicken or convert our selves
spiritually: as it is not in the will or power of a dead man, to quicken
himself naturally, or to raise up himself unto life again. The waters of the
sea, whereof Ezechiel speaks (called the dead sea, where Sodom and
Gomorrha stood) are healed; not by any thing in or of themselves, but only by
virtue of the living waters, which come into them out of the house of God.
Ezech. 47, 1 -- 8. etc. Zach. 14.8.9. with Rev. 22.1.2. And when Lazarus was
dead, he was raised up again, not at his own will, or by any power in
himself: but only of the grace and by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Ioh. 11.14 -- 44. So likewise it is not of our selves, or in the power of our
own will, but of the grace and by the power of God, to quicken and raise us
up unto life, when we are dead in sins and trespasses. As we are taught in
the Scriptures aforesaid, and other the like. When I passed by thee (says the
Lord to Israel) and savv thee polluted (or giving thy self to be trodden under
foot) in thine own blood, I said unto thee, when th^^ wast in thy blood, Live:
yea I said unto thee, when thou vvast in thy blood, Live. Ezec. 16, 6. Where
mark, that he speaks and repeateth it again, and again. I said unto thee,
when thou vvast in thy blood, Live. The like again may be observed in the dead
bones, which were quickened by the Lord, as Ezechiell likewise shows, Ezech.
37.1 -- 14.

8. The Scripture also and experience teaches, that we are flesh: and the
very thoughts and imaginations of the heart of man are only evil
continually, even from his youth, Genesis 6, 3, 5. and 8, 21. Psalm. 14, 2. with
Romans ^.9, 10, 11, 12, 19, 23. 1 Cor. 2, 14. 2 Cor. 3, 5. Mat. 6, 23. John 3, 6.
Galat. 5, 17, 19, 20, 21. Jude, v. 18, 19. Our will is become the servant of
sin: seeing we our selves are the servants of sin, and free from
righteousness; the children of wrath and disobedience; fulfilling the will of
the flesh and of the mind; yea being in the snare of the Devil, taken alive
captive by him at his will. Romans 8, 20 -- 23. and 3, 10, 11, 12. Ioh. 1, 13.
and 8, 34. Ephesians. 2, 1, 2, 3. 2 Timothy 2, 26. Tit. 3, 3. Col. 1, 21. A corrupt
tree cannot bring forth good fruit. Mat. 7, 18. Job. 14, 4. Man is abominable
and filthy, which drinks iniquity like water. Job 15, 16. We are all borne
in iniquity, and in sin did our mothers conceive us. Psalm. 51, 5. Our hearts
are stony, hard, and unplyable, to believe, and obey the word of God. Ezech.
11, 19, 20. with Genesis 6, 5. Jer. 17, 9. Psalm. 64, 6. Therefore it is and needs
must be Gods free gift of grace, and his powerful work (who is able to bring
light out of darkness, and water out of the stony rock) to take away the stony
heart out of our flesh, and to give us an heart of flesh, that is soft, and
wherein the law of God may be written by his Spirit, to convert and renew us;
to work in us both to will, and to do, of his good pleasure, and to his praise.
2 Cor. 4, 6. Ezec. 11, 19, 20. and 36, 25, 26, 27. with Exodus 17, 6. Ier. 10,
23. and 31, 18, 33, 34. Phil. 2, 13. Psalm. 10, 17. Joh. 3, 3.6.27. and 6.44.65.
and 8, 36. Heb. 12, 2. and 13, 20, 21.

9. This appears further, in that no exhortations, persuasions, corrections,
punishments, or other means can prevail with men, to bring us to godliness,
unles God renew us by his spirit. (2 Chronicles. 36, 14, 15, 16. Esa. 1.5. and 65,
1, 2. Jer. 25.1 -- 7. and 31, 18, 33, 34. Isal. 143, 10. Mat. 6, 10. Ioh. 3, 3,
6.8. Phil. 2, 13.) Nay men often become more hardened, and wax worse and
worse notwithstanding any means that can be used unto them, according to the
Proverb which says: Though thou bray a fool in a mortar yet will not his
foolishnes depart from him. Prove. 27, 22. And Romans 4, 15 and 7, 8. etc.
the Law works wrath, (says the Apostle) and increases sin, and makes
it more appear. So corrupt we are in our selves, so prone unto all evil, so
unwilling and unable to that which is good; until and unles it please God to
convert and renew us by his Spirit and grace in Christ, as is aforesaid. And
who is there (except Habak. 2, 4.
his soul be lift up, and not upright in him) that does not know and find in
himself, that we can not believe or obey, either when we would, or what we
would, or as we would: but as it pleases God of his grace and by his power to
perform his good work in us, to his praise? N^m. 20, 12. Mat. 6, 30. and 14,
30, 31. Mar. 4, 40. and 9, 23, 24. Luke 8, 25. and 17, 5. and 22, 32. Romans 7, 8
-- 25. 2 These. 1, 11, 12.

Object. But here some object, and ask, To what end then are commandments
given, and exhortations used, if we have not free will and power in our
selves to obey and perform them? Are they all given and used in vain? Does
God so mock with men? Or should we so abuse one another? etc.

Ansvv. 1. I also ask, what need there is, or to what end it is, that we
should pray unto God, to convert and quicken us; to create in us a clean heart;
to give us his spirit; to incline our hearts to his testimonies; to unite our
heart to fear his name; to fulfill the work of faith in us with power; and to
work in us that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ: if
it be in our own will and power to do these things, if we please, when we
are so required and exhorted thereunto? Jer. 31, 18. Psalm. 51, 10, 11, 12. and
86, 11. and 119.36, 37, 38.156. and 143, 10, 11. Luke 11, 13. and 17, 5. 2
These. 1, 11. Heb 13, 20, 21. May we pray unto God idly or needlessely? Must not
all our prayers be made in faith? Or shall we thus set the commandments and
exhortations of God given unto us, and our prayers made unto him, in a
contradiction one against another? Far be it from us. Rather let us be careful
to understand and use them both a^^ght. And let us learn even by this point,
of our praying unto God (as is af^resaid) how unsound their doctrine of free
will, and of the power thereof in us unto good, is and must needs be. But it
has been man's old and woonted corruption, to be Habak. 1.16.
sacrificing still to our own net: as these now would to their own will
and power,

Ans. 2. The exhortations and commandments spoken off, are means and
instruments, which it pleases the Spirit of God to use, thereby to work in
us, that which he requires of us. And so they are neither idle or fruitless,
neither yet do they argue freedom of will or power in our selves to perform
them, if we will. When darkness was upon the face of the deep. God said, Let
there be light, and there was light. Genesis 1, 2, 3. Here the commandment of
God, was the means which it pleased God to use to bring forth light out of
darkness: and was neither vain or fruitless, neither implies will or power
in the darkness and deep themselves here^^^. Which is the more to be regarded,
because the Apostle Paul uses (...) similitude in the like argument, saying,
God who commanded (...) out of darkness, has s^ined in our hearts to give the
light of the knowledge of the (...) of God, in the face of Jesus Christ. 2 Cor.
4, 6. where he shows, that faith or the saving knowledge of God in Jesus
Christ, is the mighty and singular work of Gods power in us; even as the
bringing of light out of darkness was at the beginning, Ephesians. 1, 19, 20. with
2 Cor. 4, 6. And Christ, by another similitude teaches the same, when he
says, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice
of the son of God: and they that hear, shall live. Joh. 5, 25. Like as may
be observed in that case, whereof the Prophet Ezechiell speaks: who when he
was bidden by the Lord to say unto the dry bones, O ye dry bones, hear the
word of the Lord; Thus says the Lord God unto these bones, Behold, I will
cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live; and I will lay sinevves upon
you, etc. then says he, So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I
prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came
together bone to his bone, etc. Ezec. 37.4 -- 7. etc. Where again it appears,
that the Prophets speech or exhortation to the dead and dry bones, was the
means which the Lord would use in that case: and neither was vain or
fruitles, neither yet implies ability in the dead bones themselves to
perform the thing so required of them. The same Prophet notes the like about
himself, when he was fallen on his face, at the sight of the vision, which the
Lord shevved him, first noting how a voice said unto him, Son of man, stand
upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee: and then presently annexing, says,
and the spirit entered into me, when he spoke unto me, and set me upon my feet;
and I heard him that spoke unto me: etc. Eze. 2.1.2. with chap. 1, 28. and 3,
23, 24. The like again may be observed in the Lords dealing with Daniel: and
so is noted by himself, Dan. 10.8 -- 19. And in Christ's dealing with Lazarus,
when he raised him up from death, Ioh. 11.43.44. with ver. 40, 41, 42. And as
touching the preaching and ministry of the word (vvhereabout the objection is
much urged) we read in the Acts of the Apostles, how when Luke had noted that
Lydia being together with other women assembled, heard the Apostle speak unto
them: he presently annexeth, that the Lord opened her heart, that she attended
to the things spoken by Paul. And so she became a Christian, and was baptized
and her household. Act. 16, 14, 15. Which likewise shows, that instruction
and exhortation is a means which it pleases God to use; and yet that the
fruit thereof depends upon the Lords own gracious and powerful vvorking in
us thereby, as he pleases. Whereupon it was, that the word spoken by the
Apostle, was more fruitful in Lydia, then in the other persons that were
there also met together, to whom Paul spoke, asvvell as unto her. Act.
16.13.14. Without which work and blessing of the Lord, no increase follows,
whatsoever means be used: as was showed here before. Whereunto may be
referred, that the Apostle says, I have planted, Apollo watered, but God gave
the increase. 1 Cor. 3, 6. It is God (says the Apostle) that gives the
increase; He says not, I have planted, Apollo watered: but it is of men
themselves, when the grace is offered, to receive or to refuse it, and so to
have some increase, or none at all, as pleases themselves. The Apostles teach
not so: but their doctrine leads us to acknovvledge the means used by God;
and yet thereupon neither to debase the work of God, nor to advance the will
or power of man, who is dead in sin, and alienated in mind, (...) the
flesh, and of the mind, till we be quickened, converted, and renewed by the
Lord.

Ans. 3. Besides, God may well so speak unto man, as he made him at first, in
holiness and righteousness, having free will and ability unto that which was
good and holy. Whereof now being deprived by his own voluntary fall and
transgression, the blame therefore lies upon our selves, that we are not able
to perform the commandments and exhortations given unto us, unless it please
God to renew us, and to work in us both to will, and to do, of his good
pleasure. Genesis 1, 26. and 3.1 -- 7. and 5.3. Eccl. 7.29. with Ephesians. 4.20 --
24. Phil 2.13.

Ans. 4. Otherwise in this our corrupt estate, we find that the Law works
wrath, and increases sin, and makes it more appear: we being in our
selves miserably corrupted since the fall, and more and more hardened in evil,
without the grace of God, and powerful vvorking of his spirit in us, as is
aforesaid. Romans 4.14.15. and 7.8.9. etc.

Ans. 5. And thus also may be observed, how the commandments and exhortations
spoken off, show our duty, rather then our ability. As the Law shows us
what we ought to do, not what we are able to do. Whereof we may likewise
make good use, to know our own weakness and sinfulnes the more; that so being
humbled in our selves, we may pray unto God for his grace and mercy; and that
he would work in us his own good work, with power, to the praise and glory
of his name, in Jesus Christ. Which is another good use of the commandments
and exhortations given unto us.

10. Finally, the contrary doctrine derogateth greatly from the glory of God,
and gives unto man part of the glory of our conversion and salvation. For
look how much we ascribe to the will and power of man, so much in very deed we
take from the grace and work of God. And if it be in our selves, and in the
power of our own will, to turn unto God, and to exempt our selves from others
that do it not, then should we have so far forth whereof to glory. But most
sure it is, that we have not where of to glory with God herein, who will
have the full and whole glory to himself, of our conversion and salvation in
Christ. Therefore in this respect also the contrary doctrine is erroneous, and
not according to the truth of the gospel. 1 Cor. 1, 26 -- 31. and 4, 7. Ephesians.
2, 8, 9. 2 These. 1, 11, 12. compared with Joh. 7, 18. and 16, 13, 14.

Herewith also agree some sayings of the ancient Writers. As when Augustine
says, Free will to love God we have lost by the greatness of the first sin.
August. tom. 2. epist. 107. ad Vitalem. And again, Man using free will ill,
lost both it and himself. Ibid. tom. 3. Enchiridio ad Laurentium, cap. 30.

Petrus Diaconus and others, What could or can be borne of a servant, but a
servant? For Adam when he was free begat not children, but after he was made
the servant of sin. Therefore as every one is of him, so also every man is
the servant of sin through him. Petr. Diac. etc. de incarnatione and gratia
Christi, seu de gratia and libero arbitrio, cap. 6.

And Fulgentius, Hold firmly, and doubt not at all, that no man can come to
repentance, but whom God inlighteneth, and converteth of his gracious mercy and
compassion. Fulgent or August. lib. de fide ad Petrum Diaconum. cap. 31. And
thus much concerning free will, or power in our selves unto good, since the
Fall.

CHAPTER V. Touching the perseverance of the Saints, that are truly godly, and
syncerely believe in Jesus Christ.
Whether the Saints of God, such as faithfully believe, being made partakers
of the spirit of adoption, and ingrafted into Jesus Christ by true and living
faith, are not by the grace and power of God in Christ so guided, sustained,
and preserved, as they shall not, and (in respect of God) can not, wholly and
for ever fall away from the Lord, and utterly be rejected by him, and loose
that his quickening spirit, and saving faith in Jesus Christ: Although they be
subject still in this life, through infirmity of the flesh in themselves, to
fall into sin, and sometimes also into great and grievous sins: As may be
seen in Noah, David, Peter, etc. 2 Cor. 1, 19 -- 22. Ephesians. 1, 13, 14. and 3,
16 -- 20. and 5, 23. Romans 8, 15 -- 23. 1 John 5, 1 -- 13 1 Cor. 1, 4 -- 9. Esa.
54, 8, 9, 10. and 55, 3. with Act. 13, 34. Ier. 31, 31 -- 37. and 32.40. Amos
9, 9. Habak. 2, 2, 3, 4. with Romans 1, 16, 17. and Heb. 11 chapter with 10, 38, 39.
and 13, 20, 21. Mat. 24, 24, 31. Ioh. 4, 14. and 5, 24. and 6, 35, 37, 39, 40,
54-55. and 10, 27.28, 29. and 17, 24. Rom, 8, 28 -- 39. and 11, 29. Phil. 1, 6.
Heb. 6, 17 -- 20. compared with Genesis 9, 8 -- 16.21. 2 Samuel 11, 3, 4. Mat. 26.
69 -- 75. 1 Cor. 10, 13. 2 Timothy 1, 12. 1 Pet. 1, 3, 4, 5, 21. and 5, 1, 10, 11.

1. Because the graces and fruits aforesaid, (namely, the spirit of adoption,
and faith in Jesus Christ, with the fruits thereof) are certain pledges and
assurances of Gods eternal election unto salvation: as has been showed before,
page 222. Now as God himself, so his decree and love toward his elect for
salvation, is unchangeable: and therefore it cannot be, that those whom he
has chosen unto life eternal, should by him again for ever be rejected, and
become reprobate unto condemnation: and so to fall utterly from the Lord, and
to be deprived for ever of his quickening spirit and saving faith in Jesus
Christ. Mal. 3, 6. and Exodus 3, 14, 15. Jam. 1, 17. Heb. 6, 17, 18, 19, 20.
Mat. 24, 24, 31, 34. 1 Samuel 15, 29. Psalm. 102, 13, 14, 27, 28. Ier. 31, 3. Joh.
13, 1. compared with 2 Cor. 1, 19 -- 22. Romans 8, 15.16. Gal. 4, 6. and 5, 22,
23. Ephesians. 1, 3 -- 14. Phil. 1, 6. Tit. 1, 1, 2. Romans 8, 29 -- 39.

2 Else it would follow, either that such were not the Lords, and given unto
Christ; or that the Lord is overtaken and deceived in his decree and election
of grace; or not able to preserve them, by his grace and power, to eternal
life: but that they which are his sheep, for whom Christ laid down his life,
might notvvithstanding perish, and be plucked out of his hands. Contrary to
the doctrine of Christ, Mat. 24, 24, 31, 35. Ioh. 3, 8, 14, 15, 16. and 5, 24.
and 6, 35, 37, 39, 40, 56, 57, 58. and 10, 15, 27, 28, 29. And contrary to his
prayer, Ioh. 17, 20.24. with 14, 16. Contrary also to the doctrine of the
Prophets and Apostles, Esa. 54, 9, 10. and 55, 3. with Act. 13, 34. Jer. 31, 31
-- 37. and 32, 40. Habak. 2, 2, 3, 4. with Romans 1, 16, 17. and 4.20 -- 25. and
8.29.30. 1 Pet. 1.3, 4, 5. 1 John 5.4.13.18. Revel. 13.8. and 21.27. and 22.6
-- 9. And contrary to their assured persuasion (recorded, for our instruction
and comfort, in the Scriptures) when they say, I know that my Redeemer lives,
and that he shall stand at the latter day, upon the earth; etc. Job 19, 25. And
again, I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded, that he is able to
keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. 2 Timothy 1, 12. And
(when the Apostle speaks of all the elect, saying) Who shall lay any thing
to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that justifies, who is he that
condemns? It is Christ that dyed, yea rather that is risen again, who is even
at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us. Who shall
separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or
persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? etc. Nay, in all these
things we are more then conquerours, through him that loved us. For I am
persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor
powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any
other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in
Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 8, 33 -- 39.

3. Neither else could we (in this life) have assurance of salvation in Christ:
but should still be wavering and in doubt: and so be left without sound
comfort, in the midst of the manifold tentations and afflictions of this life.
Like as comes to pass by the erroneous doctrine of the Papists in this and
other like points of their religion. Contrary also to the assured promise of
God, the true nature of faith, and the gracious testimony of Gods spirit, and
fruits thereof in us. (Besides the examples of such, as are recorded in the
Scriptures to have had assurance of salvation, and of perseverance to the end:
As was showed in some examples here before.) Psalm. 119.49.50. and 56.3.4.9 --
13. and 62 1.2. and 116.10. with 2 Cor. 4.13.14. Psa. 55.3. with Act. 13.34.
John 5.24. and 6.35.37.39.40. and 10.27.28.29. and 14.27. and 16.33. and 20.31.
Romans 4.20 -- 25. and 8.16 -- 39. 2 Cor. 1.21.22. Gal. 4.6.7. and 5.22.23.
Ephesians. 1.13.14. and 4.30. Phil. 1.6. Tit. 1.1. Hebr. 2.10.11.17.18. and 6.17 --
20. and 11 chapter 1 Pet. 1.2. -- 6. and 2 Pet. 1.3 -- 10. 1 Ioh. 5.4.13.

4. Else also, the righteousness which now we have by the redemption of Christ,
should not be more stable and firm unto us, then the righteousness which Adam,
or the Angels, had by creation, in that first estate of integrity. For Adam
fell from his righteousness; and many of the Angels also from theirs, leaving
their first estate: Whereas they which are redeemed by Christ, and made
partakers of his righteousness (having it once sealed in their hearts by the
spirit of God) shall never loose it again. For the redemption which Christ has
wrought for the elect, and the righteousness which he has brought in for us by
his death, is eternal. Dan. 9.24. Hebr. 9.12.24.28, and Romans 8.15.23.30.33.34,
38.39. 2 Cor. 1.21.22. Ephesians. 1.7.13.14. compared with Genesis 1.26.27. and 3.1
-- 7. Psalm. 49.12.20. Eccles. 7.29. 2 Pet. 2.4. Jude ver. 8. And they which
trust in the Lord, and are built upon Christ the rock, by faith in him, are (as
the Scripture says) like mount Sion, which cannot be removed, but stands
for ever. Psalm. 125.1. And like the wise man, which builds his house on a
rock: against which all the rain, floods, winds, and storms, that fall and
beat upon it, can not prevail to make it fall: because it is founded upon a
rock. Mat. 7.24.25. and 24.24.

5. Besides that if one of the elect and faithful believers in Christ, may
wholy fall away from the Lord, and be rejected for ever: then also might
another, and another: and so all of them. For we have all, like precious faith
with the Apostles themselves (though in several measure and degrees) through
the righteousness of God, and our Savior Jesus Christ. 2 Pet. 1.1. And thus the
faith (now spoken of) is fitly called the faith of Gods elect. Tit. 1.1. If
therefore any, and so all, of the elect and faithful believers in Christ,
might wholy fall away from the Lord, and be rejected for ever: how then were
the decree of Gods election eternal and unchangeable, as was shevved before?
how should the promise of God to his people be certain and everlasting? how is
the covenant of Gods grace certainly confirmed by the death of Christ, for
salvation to his elect through the blood of his cross? where and what should
be the benefit of Christ's faithful keeping and preservation of his people?
what would be the fruit and comfort of the gracious presence and powerful
working of the Spirit of Sanctification in us? Finally, where should now be
the certainty and stabilitie of the grace, power, glory, and kingdom of God
in Christ, for and through the salvation of the elect and faithful? Which the
whole Scripture teaches us to ascribe unto God, with praise and thanks for
evermore. Mat. 6.9 -- 13. compared with Ephesians. 1.3.4.5.6.7. Romans 8.29 -- 34.
Gal. 3.13.14.15. Heb. 9.11 -- 16.28. Dan. 9.24.27. and 12.1. John 10.27.28.29.
Jude ver. 1. Romans 6.2.8 -- 11. and 8.10 -- 16. Ephesians. 2.5.8.19 -- 22. with
Rev. 5.9.13. and 7.9 -- 12.

6. Hereunto may be added the consideration of the dignities, privileges, and
comforts of the godly: which the Scripture so plentifully shows and
describes. As for example that they are the sons and daughters of God, his
children, and joint heirs with Christ. 1 John 3.1. and Joh. 1.12. Romans
8.15.16.17.29. Gal. 4.5 6.7. with 2 Cor. 6.18. Mat. 9.2.22. The elect of God,
Romans 8, 33. The members of the body of Christ, whereof he is the head, and
Savior, Ephesians. 5.23.25 -- 27.29 -- 32. Living stones of that spiritual house,
whereof Christ is the foundation and chief corner stone. 1 Pet. 2, 5. 1 Cor.
3.11. Ephesians. 2, 20 -- 22. The Saints of the High ones, or of the high places.
Dan. 7, 18, 22, 25, 27. That have their names written in heaven, Luc. 10, 20.
and are set together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Ephesians. 2, 6. That have
all things work together for good unto them. Romans 8, 28. And though they fall,
yet shall not utterly be cast down, because the Lord upholdeth them with his
hand. Psalm. 37, 24. That they have redemption through the blood of Jesus
Christ, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of the grace of God,
in Christ his son. Ephesians. 1, 7. Col. 1, 12 -- 14. That Christ dwells in
them, by faith, and by his spirit, Joh. 6, 56. Ephesians. 3, 17. 1 John 4, 13. and
that by him they shall live for ever. Ioh: 6, 57, 58. That they have the first
fruits of the spirit, and are sealed with the holy spirit of promise, which is
the pledge and earnest of our inheritance: being given us of the Lord, as a
pawn for certain assurance, until the redemption of the purchased possession,
unto the praise of his glory. Romans 8, 23. 2 Cor. 1, 21, 22. Ephesians. 1, 13, 14.
That they shall never be rejected by Christ, Ioh. 6, 37. nor can be taken out of
his hands by any other. Ioh. 10, 28.29. Shall never be separated from the love
of God, which is in Christ Jesus, Romans 8, 38, 39. nor can be seduced to
destruction, by any means. Mat. 24, 24. Shall never hunger, or thirst, Ioh. 6,
35. and 4, 14. Shall never perish, or come into condemnation, but pass from
death unto life. Ioh. 5, 24. with 3, 16. and 17.3.12.15.24. Having fellowship,
not only with the Apostles, but even with God the Father, and with his son
Jesus Christ. 1 Ioh. 1, 3. 1 Cor. 10, 16. And made partakers of the divine
nature, and of al things perteyning to life and godliness, yea even of eternal
life (though not in that measure and manner, as shall be after this life, in the
kingdom of heaven, for ever) 2 Pet. 1, 3, 4. 1 Ioh. 5, 4, 12, 13, 20. compared
with 1 Cor. 13, 9, 10. Col. 3, 3. 1 Ioh. 3, 2.

7. Finally, seeing all acknovvledge that the Lord (by his grace and power)
keeps the elect Angels, that they fall not from their integrity: but are
preserved and confirmed in goodness to the enjoying of eternal happiness: Why
should we not also believe, that God both can and will (through his grace and
power in Christ) preserve al his elect among men, who (though we fell from
our integrity in our first parents, yet) are though his grace redeemed from
wrath by the death of Christ his son, and begotten again to a lively hope,
by the resurrection of Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible,
and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for us, who are
kept by the power of God, through faith, unto salvation, which is ready to be
revealed in the last time. 1 Timothy 5, 21. compared with Heb. 12, 22. and 1, 13,
14. Luke 20, 36. Col. 2, 10. Rev. 22, 6 -- 9. 1 Pet. 1, 3, 4, 5 -- 9 -- 12. and
5, 1, 10, 11.

Whereunto agree some speeches of the ancient Writers. viz, That ^^^^llian
says, As he has left unto us the earnest of the Spirit, so has he also taken
of us the (...) of the flesh, and carried it into heaven as a pledge that the
whole sum shall in time be (...) thither. Be ye therefore confident, O flesh
and blood, you have taken possession both of (...) and of the kingdom of God
in Christ. Tertul. lib. de resur. carnis, cap. 51.

And Augustine, He therefore makes them persevere in good, that makes them to
be good. But they that fall and perish, were not in the number of them that are
predestinate. August. tom. (...) de correptione and gratia, cap. 12. Also,
Being freed from sin they are made the servants of righteousness, in which
they shall stand unto the end, he giving unto them perseverance, who (...) new
them, and predestined them, and according to his purpose has called, and
justified, and glorified them. Ibid. And again, This perseverance God has
promised, saying, Jer. 32 40.
I will put my fear in their heart, that they shall not depart from me. Which
what other thing is it, but that such and so great shall be my fear, which I
will put in their heart, as they shall clean unto me with perseverance. Ibid.
lib. de bono perseverantiae, cap. 2.

And hitherto of the perseverance of the Saints, which sincerely believe in
Jesus Christ.

The conclusion: and general confirmation of the points aforesaid.
ANd now for a summarie confirmation of the premises, and conclusion of the
several matters aforesaid, let me also annexe this reason in general, as
follows:

Whatsoever doctrines or opinions derogate from the glory of God in Christ,
and give unto man part of the glory of our salvation: those are erroneous
doctrines and opinions, and such as cannot agree with the truth which is
according to godliness. Joh. 16, 13, 14. and 7, 18. 1 Cor. 1, 26, 27 -- 31. Ier
9, 23, 24. Ephesians. 2, 8, 9. with Tit. 1, 1.

But such are the doctrines and opinions of the Anabaptists, Arminians and
others, touching the points aforesaid: as in the particulars thereof may be
seen. The Anabaptists derogate from the glory of God, in that they do not
acknowledge the extent, and stabilitie, of his covenant; and the seal thereof,
according to his word, and work. And in their opinions and practice, they
both add unto, and take from the word of God. They add in their repeating or
renewing of Baptism, which God has not appointed to be done: And they take
away from it, both in that they deny the baptism received in apostate churches
to be true baptism, and Gods sign and seal of his covenant; and in
vvith-holding of baptism from children, to whom God has ordained the sign
and seal of his covenant to be given: as has been shevved here before, page 1
-- 27. etc.

The Arminians also in their opinions derogate from Gods glory, and advance
frail man: namely, in the two first of the points aforesaid touching Gods
decree: vvhiles they ground not the eternal decree of God, wholly and only on
the good pleasure of his will: but upon the faith and holiness, unbelief or
wickedness of men, foreseen: In the third, by extending the redemption of
Christ, further then the intendement of God; yea even to the reprobate them
selves: In the fourth, by ascribing our conversion and salvation; in part, to
our selves and our own free will: and not wholy and only to the free gift
of God, and powerful work of his grace in us: In the first and last, by
debasing (in deed) the unchangeable decree and firm promises of God; the
mighty power and faithful custody of Christ our Lord, the comfortable
presence, assured pledge, and gracious work, of the holy Ghost, in his Saints
and faithful people.

Therefore such doctrines and opinions of theirs are erroneous, and greatly
disagreeing from the truth which is according to godliness.

Let him that reads consider. And the Lord give us aright to understand his
word, humbly to obey his will, and faithfully to hold his truth, unto the
end, Amen.

Now unto him that is able to keep us from falling, and to present us
faultlesse before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy; to the only
wise God our Savior, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, now and ever.
Amen. Jude v. 24.25.

THE THIRD TREATISE Of some things which concern the worship of God, and order
of the Church: especially concerning the Reformed Churches.
HAving now briefly treated of these points of Religion, which are called in
question betvveen the Remonstrants, and others of the Reformed Churches: I will
here also annexe some other things concerning the Reformed Churches themselves.
Which I acknowledge to be the Churches of Christ: and with whom I agree both in
the faith of Christ, and in many things concerning the order and government of
the church. Yet because there are some particulars (of weight) touching the
worship of God, and policy of the Church, wherein I think they are not as yet
come to the synceritie of the Primitive Churches constitution; and am
persuaded that the Lord is now bringing his churches and people thereunto
(from the apostasy and corruptions of Antichrist the man of sin:) and that
he will in time accomplish this his work already begun, (whether before or
together with the conversion of the Jews to the Christian faith, the Lord
knovveth, and time will manifest:) therefore have I thought it good
herevvithal to note some few things thereabout.

The particulars are not all of them of like weight or evidence (in mine own
persuasion) but some of them such, as far more may be said and borne with
about them, then about others of them. Neither do all of them concern all the
Reformed churches alike: but some of them more, and some less: inasmuch as
their estate in diverse Churches and places does diversely differ hereabout. Yet
notvvithstanding I thought it not amiss thus to propound the^ here together:
desiring of al, that they would seriously consider these things, in the fear of
God, and according to his word; and hoping that the due consideration thereof
will (through the blessing of God) become profitable for the furtherance of the
truth, and further building up of the church, to the praise of his name, in
Jesus Christ.

CHAPTER I. Touching Book prayer.
Whether it be the Lords ordinance, that his churches and servants, should
(when they pray) read their prayers out of a book, even certain set words
imposed by men; and so use a form and manner of prayer and leitourgie devised
and prescribed by man, for their spiritual sacrifice of prayer and worship of
God: And consequently, whether it be lavvfull for us, in such manner to
worship the Lord. Exodus 20, 4, 5, 6. and 30, 9. compared with Psalm. 141, 2.
Esa. 29, 13. with Mat. 15, 9. Lev. 10, 1, Mal. 1.8, 14. Romans 8, 26. Ephesians. 4,
8 -- 12. 1 Pet. 2, 5. Rev. 8, 3, etc.

I. Seeing that the book-prayer aforesaid, being not appointed by the Lord, or
approved in his word, is an invention of Man in the worship of God. And men's
inventions in Gods worship, are transgressions of the second commandment.
Exodus 20, 4, 5. with Lev. 10, 1. Judge. 8, 27. Psa. 119, 113, 128. Esa. 29, 13.
and 30, 21, 22,

II. Thus also it is as an image and similitude of spiritual prayer, which yet
it is not. And so these books and stinted prayers prescribed by man, in the
worship of God, come in deed to be idols, supplying the place of the word and
spirit of God* which ought not to be. In which respect, such manner of
worship becomes idolatrous and superstitious, forbidden of the Lord, and not
to be communicated vvithall. For what agreement has the temple of God with
Idols? 2 Cor. 6.16. Exodus 20, 4, 5, 6. compared with Romans 8, 26. Ephesians 6, 18.
1 Pet. 2, 5. and with the other Scriptures aforesaid, and the like.

III. The incense offered by the Priests upon the golden Altar in the time of
the Law, was a type of prayer offered up unto God by the mediation of Christ:
Psalm. 141, 2. Rev. 8, 3, 4. And therefore as it was not lavvfull to use any
strange incense, but that only which God appointed: so neither is it lavvful
to use any strange manner of prayer, but such only as the Lord requires.
Exodus 30, 9. with Psalm. 141, 2. Now that the Lord did ever ordeyne in his
worship the book-prayer aforesaid, who can show? Yea, or that any of the
godly (either the Patriarks, Prophets, Apostles, or other men or women)
recorded in the Scriptures, when they would pray unto God, did ever take a
book in their hands, to read out of it some stinted prayers prescribed by men,
for their sacrifice of prayer and supplication to God? Or can we think, if
this were the manner of prayer and worship which God required, that the
Scripture would be silent in it; or that none of the servants of God set before
us for examples in the Scriptures, should ever use it; or that we should
prescribe or use such manner of prayer in the worship of God, as never any of
the godly mentioned in the Scripture did use? If then in the time of the Legal
shadows under Moses, God would not admit of any strange thing in his
worship, but did severely punish it, as may be seen in the example of Nadab and
Abihu, Levit. 10, 1. how shall we think that he will now admit of any
strange manner of prayer for his worship in the time of the Gospel under
Christ; whenas Christ the son is worthy of more honor, then Moses the
servant. Heb. 3, 3, 5, 6.

IIII. It derogateth from the honor, fruit, and benefit of the ascension of
Christ: who ascending up on high, has given gifts unto men for the work of
the ministry: and therefore as well for prayer, as for doctrine and
preaching etc. Ephesians. 4, 8, 12. with Act. 6, 4. If any be not endued with such
gifts, there is no vvarrant to choose them to be ministers of Christ. If they be
so endued, there is no vvarrant for others to prescribe, nor for themselves to
read over such stinted prayers, prescribed by men for the worship of God.
Neither does it only derogate from the honor and benefit of Christ's
ascension into heaven: but also from the care, love, and bounty that he has
and shows continually to his church upon earth, giving still gifts unto men
for the work of the ministry, from time to time. Ephesians. 4, 8 -- 13. and
Psalm. 68, 19. with 1 Cor. 12, 4, 5, 6. 1 Timothy 2, 1. and 6, 13, 14. with Matthew.
28, 20. Else also why do they not put a book of Homilies, in the hands of all
the Ministers, to be read over daily for their sermons to the people, asvvell
as a book of prayers, in and for the worship of God? And why do not the
ministers use the one, as well as the other, in their public ministration?

V. The spirit of God is the only help which he gives us to help our
infirmities in the time of prayer: (not books, or beads, or any such thing*)
Romans 8, 26, 27. Gal. 4, 6. Zach. 12, 10. Ephesians. 6, 18. Jude ver. 20. And how
else should blind men pray, that cannot read? Besides that Book-prayer
quenches the spirit, and abridgeth the work of the holy Ghost, suppressing the
gifts and graces of God in us, and removing the heart far from God, hovvever we
may seem with the mouth to come near unto him: inasmuch as our prayers are
not drawn and powered out of the heart by the help of the spirit of God,
according to our present and continual occasions: but are prescribed unto us,
and read in a book, still alike, from time to time, 1 These. 5, 17, 18, 19. Esa.
29, 13. compared with 1 Samuel 1, 15. Zach. 12, 10. Phil. 4, 6.

VI. We our selves as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy
Priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus
Christ. 1 Pet. 2, 5. with John 4, 24. Rev. 1, 5, 6. Therefore also should we
not read our prayers out of a book, when we worship God: seeing it is not a
living or spiritual sacrifice, but dead and carnal: And how then is it a
worship acceptable to God by Jesus Christ? as all our prayers and worship of
God should be. 1 Pet. 4, 5. with Rev. 8, 3. Romans 8, 26, 27. 1 These. 5, 17, 18.
1 Timothy 2, 1 -- 5. 1 John 5, 13, 14, 15. Jude v. 20, 21.

VII. Prayer is to be made, for things that are needful, and lawful to be
asked of God, according to the several occasions, estate, and conditions of
people, publicly and privately, jointly and severally, in churches and common
weals, by sea and by land, in peace and in war, in prosperity and
adversity, spiritual and bodily, etc. and thanksgiving again accordingly to
be rendered unto God upon the prayers heard, etc. as throughout the Scriptures
may be seen, Phil. 4, 6. and 1 These 5, 17, 18. compared with Genesis 32, 9 -- 12.

14, 15, 16. Jude v. 20. Rev. 5, 8. and 8, 3. Which does yet the more make
against Book prayer: that is still read over, thirty, fifty, an hundred, yea
many hundreds of years: as if God never heard our prayers; or gave not
continually several occasions of prayer, to churches and people of all sorts,
public and private: which none can conceive, much less express the manifold
and unspeakable particulars thereof.

VIII. If Book-prayer were the ordinance of God, why did not the Prophets and
Apostles make such books of prayer, and leave them to the church, as they did
their other vvritings, for continual use, public and private? Or shall we
think, that they were unfaithful to the Lord, (...) unsufficient for this
work, if it had been committed unto them? Or that those which make or prescribe
such books, are more wise, more careful, more sufficient, then they were?
Moses says, Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall
you diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the Commandments of the Lord your
God, which I command you. Deuteronomy. 4, 2. and 12, 32. The Prophet Esaias sends all,
to the Law and to the testimony: affirming that (...) men speak not according
to this word, it is because there is no light in them. Esa. 8.2^. The Apostle
says, that he delivered to the churches, what he received of the Lord: and
shunned not to declare unto them all the counsel of God. Act 20.27. 1 Cor.
11.1.2.23. and 14.37. And he straightly charge Timothee (and in him all the
ministers of Christ) to keep the commandment (given in that Epistle of his)
without spot, and unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Timothy 6, 13, 12. Either therefore Book-prayer is none of Gods counsels,
commandments, and ordinances: or if it were, the Prophets and Apostles have
delivered such books to the Churches, and ministers of God, with commandment
accordingly to use them. Which if any could bring forth, the question were
soon ended. But if the Prophets and Apostles never made, nor ever appointed
others to make, such books of prayer, for such use, as is aforesaid: by what
right then may any take upon them, to make, prescribe, or use them, in such
sort, as churches and people now daily do? Or how shall we assure our selves,
or others, that it is not a will worship, devi^ed by man, and displeasing to
God?

IX. Yea and let it be well considered, whether it be not a part of the
apostasy of Antichrist, and such as mainteyneth superstition, and (in some
churches) an Idol and dumb ministry, and nourishes the people still in
ignorance of the nature and right use of prayer, etc. D. Raynolds writing
against Bellarmine, has this general proposition, that to worship God after an
unlawful manner is superstition, as Col. 2, 23
Paul witnesses, and In 2a. 2a. quaest. 92. and 93.
Aquinas: and superstitious zeal is preposterous, as the Romans 10, 2. Aquin. in
Romans 10, lect. 1.
same persons testify, because it is not ordered by a right knowledge. Rayn.
de Romans Eccles. Idolat. contra Bellarminum. lib. 1, cap. 5. sect. 9.

X. If such books of prayer so used, be the leitourgie and worship which the
Lord has appointed, then ought all Churches and people on earth to use that
service and manner of worship. Mat. 28.20. 1 Timothy 6.13.14. Rev. 22.18.19. And
who then shall make such books, for all churches and people in the world? Or
who can show, that the Primitive Churches, planted by the Apostles and
recorded in the Scriptures, had any such books of prayer prescribed unto them?
Or that the Christians in that age did read their prayers out of such books,
and so worship God? Find we not mention of their prayers diverse times
recorded? Mat. 14, 28, 30. Luke 17, 5. Act. 1, 24, 25. and 4, 24 -- 30. And do
not the Apostles in their writings, Paul, James, Peter, John, and Jude, every
of the^ in their Epistles speak of prayer, and of the manner and use thereof?
yet where does any one of them teach the Churches or particular persons to
whom they write, to read their prayers out of a book, and so to use set forms
of prayer devised by men, for their spiritual worship of God, and making their
requests known unto him? Let the Scriptures here noted before ( in the 7
section) and all their vvritings throughout be searched hereabout.

XI. Finally, if such book-prayers be the ordinance of God, and lawful to be
used in such sort, as is aforesaid: then might one man know and set down
another prayers aforehand; and all men might buy their prayers at the book
bynders shops; and carry them in their pockets, and so out of their pockets
take their prayers, etc. Whereas right and true spiritual prayer is the work of
Gods spirit, in our hearts, stirring, teaching and inabling us to power out
our souls and prayers unto God in all our necessities and occasions: and so to
offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ; as is
aforesaid. Romans 8, 15, 26, 27. Ephesians. 6, 18. Phi. 4, 6. J^de v. 20. 1 Samuel 1,
12, 15. Zach. 12, 10. 1 Pet. 2, 5. Rev. 8, 3, 4.

Diverse objections and exceptions made hereabout, I have treated of Quaest. de
precibus p. 12. etc.
otherwhere in particular. To which I refer the Reader: as also to the
writings of others heretofore, concerning the same argument. For which see M.
Greenvvoods treatise of read prayer, etc. besides the handling of this
question, in two epistles, betvveen M. Carp. and my self: p. 11, 12, etc.

CHAPTER II. Touching the constitution of particular Churches.
Whether by the ordinance of God, there should be any set ordinary churches
now, but only particular churches, And whether the constitution of all the
particular churches should not be such, as each of them, may ordinarily come
together in one place: for the performance of the worship of God, and all
other duties apperteyning unto them, by the word of God?

I. Because the Primitive churches were thus planted and constituted by the
Apostles: And this also approved and stablished by Christ our Lord. As may be
seen in the seven Churches of Asia, spoken of in the Revelation, Rev. 1, 4, 12,
13, 20. with chapter 2, 1, 8, 12, 18. and 3, 1, 7, 14. And in the other like
churches: at Jerusalem, Act. 1, 13, 14, 15. and 6, 2, 5. and 15, 22, 23. and
21, 18, 22. at Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, Act. 14, 21, 23, 27. and 15, 30.
at Troas, Act. 20, 7, 8. at Ephesus, Act. 20, 17, 28. Rev. 2, 1. with 1 Timothy
1, 3. and 3, 15. and 5, 20. at Rome, Romans 12, 3 -- 8. at Cenchrea, Romans 16, 1.
at Corinth, 1 Cor. 1, 2. and 4, 17. with chap. 5, 4. and 10, 16, 17. and 11,
20, 22, 23. and 12, 18, 19 -- 27. and 14, 23, 33, 40. In Galatia, Gal. 1, 2. at
Philippi, Phil. 1, 1. at Colosse and Laodicea, Col. 4, 16, 17. at Thessalonica,
1 These. 1, 1. with chapter 5.12.13.14.27. etc.

II. Thus also the particular churches of Christians, are still answerable (in
this behalf) to the particular Synagogues of the Jews, Luke 4, 16, 20, 31, 33.
and 7, 5. Act. 13.14.15. and 17.1. and, 18, 4, 7, 8, 27. And as the house where
the Jews met was called a Synagogue, Luke 7, 5. so the Apostle now also
calls the meeting of Christians together, a Synagogue, Jam. 2, 2. Neither
this only, but seeing now every particular constituted church has right and
power within it self to celebrate the Lords supper, which is answerable to
the Passover, that was kept at Jerusalem: this shows moreover, that now
every particular church is to be esteemed as Jerusalem: and so to stand
immediately under Jesus Christ the Archpastor of his sheep, and the high Priest
of our profession. 1 Cor. 10, 16, 17, 18. and 11, 23. etc. Act. 2, 42. and 20,
7, 17, 28. compared with Deuteronomy. 12, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14. and 16, ^, 5, 6. 2 Chronicles.
29. and 30. and 35 chapter Ezra 6, 18, 19. Esa. 66, 19 -- 23. Ier. 3, 15, 16, 17.
Rev. 21, 1, 2. etc.

III. Neither else can the Pastor of each particular Church stand immediately
under Christ the Archpastor: Nor can the Ministers and Elders jointly, and
together with their flock, sanctify the Lords day, nor feed the Church over
which the holy Ghost has made them Overseers, nor perform any other public
action, with them, unto them, and before them, duly and orderly, whether it be
the ministration of the word, or of the Sacraments, or Censures, or any
actions that are publicly and jointly together to be performed: according as
was done in the Synagogues of the Jews, and in the primitive churches. For
which see the Scriptures here before alleged, and other the like: as Mark 13,
34 -- 37. Luke 4.16 -- 20. and 12, 42. Act. 20.^, 28. Romans 12.4 -- 8. 1 Cor.
4.1. and 14.23.33 -- 40. Col. 4.17. 1 Pet. 5.1 -- 4. 1 Timothy 5.17.20. Heb.
13.7.8.17.

IIII. Nor can they well otherwise know of certainty, whether the members of
the Church be present or absent, at their public meetings, for the worship of
God, or other duties there to be performed, that so they may watch over them,
as those that must give account for them unto God. Act. 20.28. Heb. 13.17. 1
Pet. 5.1 -- 4.

V. Neither can the Churches, or members thereof, be so well instructed,
governed, and edified, in faith and mutual love, as if this order and practice
be observed. For which see also the Scriptures aforesaid, and the like.

But if the church in any city be more large (as often comes to pass, and is
usual in great cities) then that it can conveniently and ordinarily meet
together in one place: then is it to be considered, whether it should not be
distinguished and distributed into diverse particular Churches or parishes.
Which may every one of them severally have their own peculiar place of
meeting together; their own Pastor, and other ministers, Elders, and Deacons,
their own meetings, and all public actions duly and orderly performed, among
themselves, for the reasons here before alleged, and other the like. To which
end may also be observed, how at Jerusalem (where the great Synedrion of the
Jews was by the Lord appointed to be, yet notvvithstanding) there were, in
that one city many Synagogues. And all the Synagogues also had their own
rulers and ministers, as may appear by such other Synagogues as are
particularly spoken of in the Scriptures. Mar. 5, 22. with Luke 4, 16, 20, 31,
33. and 12, 11. and 21 12. with Mat. 10, 17. and 23, 34, Luke 13, 14. with
Act. 13, 14, 15. and 18, 4, 7, 8, 17.

Here moreover (about the estate, and distinction of churches) are two things
carefully to be observed; First, As did the seven churches of Asia, etc. Rev.
1, and 2, and 3 chap.
that all particular churches with their Pastors (as is noted here before) do
stand immediately under Jesus Christ the Archpastour, without any other
strange ecclesiastical power and authority interposed betvveen, whether it be
of the Prelates, (as of Diocesan Provincial, or Oecumenicall Bishops;) or of
their unlawful usurping Synods, or any such like, invented by men, and brought
into the church: Secondly, that notwithstanding the estate and distinction
aforesaid, yet, all the churches, and ministers of them, should be always ready
and vvilling, with their mutual aid, counsel, assistance and all lawful
maanes, to help, comfort, advise, strengthen, and build up one another, in the
truth which is according to godliness, in Jesus Christ. Ephesians. 4.4 -- 16. Romans
12, 3 -- 8. 1 Cor. 12, 4 -- 27. Col. 2, 5, 19. and 4, 16, 17. Act. 15, 2 -- 23.
with Psalm. 12 2, 3. Sal. Song. 8, 1. etc..

And so to this end, and in this manner, may be had a lavvfull and profitable
use of Synods, Classes, Assemblies, or Councels, for mutual help and advise, in
cases of question, controversy, and difficulties about religion: to as
alvvaies it be provided, that they do not challenge or usurp any unlawful
jurisdiction or power over the particular churches, or their pastors and
governors, to whom their own power, under Christ the Lord, is alvvay to be
reserved, and to be kept whole and intier, according to the word of God. Like
as may be seen in all the churches planted by the Apostles: and particularly in
those seven of Asia (standing not far asunder:) to whom Christ vvrote his
several letters, directed to the Angels or Pastors of every of them in
particular: and not to any one of the churches or Pastors more the^ another, as
having authority over the rest; nor to any Diocesan Provincial or Oecumeniall
Bishops set over the churches and Pastors thereof. Which kind of Prelacie,
Office and government, if it had been ordained by Christ, and planted by the
Apostles in those churches: there had now ben fit and necessary occasion
(specially when Christ vvrote about the corruptions of those churches) both to
have blamed those Bishops for neglect of their duty (as he does the Angels of
the particular Churches) and to have directed his letters unto them, as being
the next and chiefest in ecclesiastical authority under him, to oversee and
govern those churches: if then there had been any such among them, by the
ordinance of Christ. Rev. 2, 1.8.12 18. and 3 1.7 14. compared with chapter
1.4.12.13.20. and with the estate and constitution of all other churches
planted by the Apostles. For which, see the Scriptures here be^^^^ alleged:
page 250. And of this also see more hereafter in the fifth (...) here follovving,

If any ask, to whom then the churches shall be subject, if there be no Diocesan
or other like Prelates set over them: I answer, that the churches and all the
Officers and members thereof, are to be subject to the Princes, States, and
magistrates, under whom they live: according as the Apostles do teach us,
saying, Let every soul be subject to the higher powers; etc. Re^. 13.1. Submit
your selves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake, whether it be to the
king, as supreme, or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him, for
the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well. 1
Pet. 2, 13, 14. with Tit. 3, 1. The magistrates are under the Lord to be the
keepers of both the Tables of the Law of God: To whom al persons ought to be
subject, even for conscience sake, and to yield obedience unto them: yet
always in the Lord, and not against the Lord by any means. Deuteronomy. 17, 18, 19,
20, Romans 13, 1 -- 7. with Mat. 22, 21. Dan. 3, 14 -- 18. Act. 4, 18, 19, 20.
Rev. 12, 10, 11.

CHAPTER III. Touching the right and power of particular churches.
Whether every Church have not right and power granted by the Lord, to choose
their own Pastors, and other Ministers, Elders, Deacons, and Deaconesses:
making choice of meet and fit persons: as also to * use the ministration of the
word, Sacraments, Censures, and whole ecclesiastical administration; being
careful still to have al things done, according to the ordinance of God,
prescribed in his word. Mat. 28, 18 -- 20. with (...) Act 6, 3, 5. and 14, 23.
compared with Act. 1, 15, 23, 26. and 2, 41, 42, 46. and 11, 22. and 15, 22,
25. 1 Cor. 16, 3. 2 Cor. 8, 19. Gal. 1, 1. 1 Timothy 3, 1 -- 15. and 5, 9, 10, 11,
17, ^2. and 6, 13, 14. and Ezec. 33, 2. Lev. 8, 2, 3, 4, 5. Number. 8, 9. Deuteronomy. 1,
13 and 16, 18. with Joh. 13, 20. 1 Cor. 4, 1. 2 Cor. 5, 19. Heb. 5, 4. Also *
Act. 1, 2, 3, 14, 15. and 15, 2, 6, 23, 30, and 20, 7, 17, 18. and 21, 18 --
23. Romans 12, 6, 7, 8. and 16, 1, 2. Mat. 18, 17, 18, 19, 20. and 28, 18, 19,
20. 1 Cor. 4, 17. and 5 chapter and 10, 16. and 11, 23 -- 26. and 12 chapter Epist. to
Timoth. and Tit. Rev. 2, and 3 chapter with 1 Timothy 6, 13, 14.

I. Because the Primitive churches planted by the Apostles, had this right and
power at the beginning: as may be seen in the Scriptures here before alleged.

II. And the Congregation of Israel had of old likewise their right in the
election of their officers, and other such weighty and public affairs: Which
therefore is not now to be denied unto Christians. Levit. 8, 2 -- 5, Deuteronomy.
1.13. and 16, 18. and 17, 2 -- 7. compared with the Scriptures aforesaid: and
particularly, with 1 Cor. 4, 17. and 5, 13. and 10, 18. etc. And in the
Apostles days, Christians newly converted from paganism, and therefore as
unfit and unexpert as men in these times, yet had and used this their right and
liberty, as is before shevved.

III. Besides that this manner of calling is of special weight for the guiding
and keeping of the people in obedience to the truth, and in love and reve^^^^^
of their ministers and other Officers, when they are such as themselves, in
duty to God, and for their own instruction, guiding and service, have made
choice off. For which, compare the Scriptures aforesaid, with 1 These. 5, 12,
13. and 1 Timothy 5, 17.

IIII. And seeing a true and lawful calling is necessary to be had, For
otherwise how should men be assured that they are called and sent of God?
Jer. 17, 16. Amos 7, 15 Heb. 5, 4. Or why does the Lord account them for
intruders and strangers, and severely punish them, which run being unsent
and uncalled, and take upon them that which the Lord has not laid upon them?
Number. 16 chapter and 18, 7. 2 Chronicles. 26, 16 -- 21. Ezec. 44, 9 -- 15. Rev. 2.2,
campared with Ier. 23, 21. and Joh. 10, 1 -- 5. Or how else should the people
receive them as from the Lord, ministering and speaking to them in his stead?
Ioh. 13, 20. 2 Cor. 5, 19, 20.) Therefore if this be not that manner of
entrance which Christ has ordained, either some other must be showed out of
the word of God appointed by him now to be had; or it must be proved, that now
it is lavvfull to devise new kinds of election and entrance, or that men may
intrude themselves at their own or other men's pleasure, as they think good.
Neither of which can ever be approved.

V. Here also may be observed, how in other weighty affairs behoofull and
belonging to the whole body of the church, they were usually done, in
Israel, and the Primitive Churches, openly with the Churches knowledge, in a
public assembly, and (as the nature of the cases, and other circumstances
required) with their consent or approbation having this care, that all should
keep their place, and perform their duties, according to the rules prescribed
in the word of God. Thus they had openly and publicly the word ministered,
Neh. 8 chapter Jer. 7, and 26 chap. Act. 13, 14, 15. and 15, 21. and 20, 28. 1 Cor.
14, 23, 24. 1 Timothy 1, 3. and 3, 15. and 4.13. the Passover, and the Lords
supper celebrated, 2 Chronicles. 30. and 35 chapter ^^^r. 10, 16, 17, 18. and 11, 18,
20. etc. the punishments, and censures on sinners and malefactors inflicted.
Deuteronomy. 17, 2 -- 13. and 21, 18 -- 21. Ioh. 16, 2. 1 Cor. 5, 3, 4, 5, 13. 1 Timothy
5, 20. The Elders in Israel sat and judged in the gates, where the people
did and might come: Deuteronomy. 21, 18 -- 21. and 22, 13-21. and 25.5 -- 10. with
Ruth. 4.1 -- 11. And afterward when they lived under the Romans, or out of
their own country, they sat and judged in their councels, or houses of
judgment; and inflicted punishment in their Synagogues. Mat. 10, 17. and 23,
32. Luke 6, 22. and 21.12. Joh. 9, 22. and 12, 42. Act. 23, 1 -- 7. and 24, 20,
21. The children of Israel on this side Jorden, hear, and send to the
children of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, about the Altar which they set up, in
the borders of Jordan, Josh. 22.11 -- 33. The people were assembled, when
reformation of strange marriages, was to be made. Ezra 10 chapter Praise is given to
God, in the congregation of the people, and assembly of the Elders, Psalm.
137.32. The high Priest and the Elders of the nation, and the Priests and the
other people of the Jews, send letters to the Lacedaemonians. 1 Match. 12, 6.
Lysias also and king Antiochus send letters to the Counsel, and the rest of
the Jews, 2 Match. 11, 16, 27. Jonathan calls the Elders of the people
together, and consulteth with them about building strong holds in Judea:
vvhereupon the people come together to build up the city, etc. 1 Match. 12, 35,
36.37. Likewise in the primitive churches, and vvhiles the Apostles lived, the
church sends forth some for the further instruction or building up of others
in the faith. Act. 11.22. and 15.22.25.27. Public controversies in religion,
are publicly heard, disputed, and determined. Act. 11, 2 -- 18. and 15.2 --
22. with 16.4. and 17.1.2.3. and 21.18 -- 22 -- 25. Public sinners are openly
rebuked before a^^ and delivered to Satan, when the church is gathered
together. 1 Timothy 5.20. 1 Cor. 5.3.4.5.11.12.13. compared with Deuteronomy. 17.2 -- 7.
General letters about public affairs and occasions, are written by the
Apostles, Elders, and brethren. Act. 15.23. Gal. 1.1.2. 1 Cor. 16.3. They that
are sent with letters or benevolence or upon other such occasions from one
church to another, are chosen or approved of the churches. Act. 15.2.22.23. 1
Cor. 16.^. and 2 Cor. 8.19. In which several cases, and the like (although
some differences may be observed whereupon now I insist not: as namely that
some of them are done with election according to the suffrages and voices of
the people, or other approbation, some way signified; others or them are
decreed by the Elders, and publikly denounced or executed, etc. yet
notwithstanding) this point and the manner of dealing aforesaid is duly and
carefully to be regarded: And that the more, inasmuch as in those times there
were besides the Elders of the people, the Prophets and Priests in Israel, the
Apostles and Ministers in the Primitive churches, who (if any at al) might have
excluded the people in such cases, or kept from them the knowledge thereof, if
it had been lavvfull so to do: specially seeing they had the Elders of the
churches then present and consenting with them. Which yet they would not do,
though they were the messengers of the Lord of hosts, the Prophets and
Apostles of Christ, the builders and Maister-builders in the framing, guyding,
and establishing of the churches in the way and order appointed by the Lord.
But now what they might or would have done, if the people were refractarie,
or took to much upon them, or were divided into parts and factions, and would
not consent nor rest, or be obedient, as they should: that is another question,
which here I treat not off. Numb. 16 chapter 2 Chronicles. 26.16 -- 20. Ier. 26.8 --
24. Act. 20.17.28. 1 Cor. 4.21. and 11.18. etc. 2 Cor. 12.20.21. and 13.1.2.8.
1 Timothy 1.20. and 5.17.19.20.21. and 6.13.14. Tit. 2.15. Rev. 2.14.20. etc.

VI. Moreover, not only the Catholic, but also every particular Church (in a
right and due consideration) is the church and city of God, the body of Christ,
the kingdom of God, the ground and pillar of truth, the house of the living
God, etc. Psa. 87, 3. Rev. 21, 2. etc. Mat. 5.14.22. and 10, 17. and 13.24. and
18.15 -- 20. 1 Cor. 5, 13. with Deu. 17.2.7. and 21.18 -- 21. Romans 12.3 -- 8. 1
Cor. 12, 20 -- 27. with 3.21.22.23. and 4.17. and 5 chapter and 11.23 -- 26. and
14.33. 1 Timothy 1.3. with 3.15. The Spirit of God has spoken alike to all the
seven Churches, and to each of the Angels thereof, and all that have ears to
hear, are willed to hearken what the Lord says. Rev, 1, 4.11. and 2, and 3
chap. Mat. 13.43.

VII. The Prophets also foretold, that under the Gospel every place of Mount
Sion, and the assemblies thereof, should have the like gracious presence,
light, glory, and protection of God, as Israel had when the Lord brought them
out of the land of Egypt. Esa. 4, 2, 4, 5. with Exodus 13, 21.

VIII. Finally; Churches else should not have power from Christ (in time of
persecution, or after the apostasy of Antichrist) to retain, reviue, and
observe the Apostolic ordinances, once (for all) delivered to the Church.
Which were contrary to Mat. 28.18.19.20. Act. 5.28.29. Phil. 1.1.28.29.30.
Col. 2.5. 1 These. 3, 2.3. 2 These. 2.3 -- 15. 1 Timothy 6.13.14. Jude v. 3. Rev.

CHAPTER IIII. Touching the Pastors and other Officers administration.
Whether it lie not upon the Pastors and all others that bear office in the
church of God, to fulfill their Ministry, and to perform al things
perteining to their office, according to the word of God: And not according to
the Statutes or Edicts of Princes and States; the Canons of Prelates; the
Constitutions of Synods; the pleasure or voices of the people; or any other
way invented or obtruded upon them by men. 1 Cor. 4, 1, 2. Col. 4, 17. Act.
20, 17 -- 24 -- 32. with 13, 24, 25. Romans 12, 7, 8. 1 These. 5, 12, 13, 14. 1
Pet. 5, 1 -- 4. with Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20. and 6, 24. The Epistles to Timothee,
and Titus. Heb. 3, 1, 2, 3. and 13, 7, 17. Ioh. 15, 14, 15, 16. Gal. 1, 8, 9,
10. Rev. 2, and 3, and 14, 4, 6, 9, 12. compared with Lev. 10, 1, 2, 3. Deuteronomy.
4, 2. and 12, 32. and 33, 8 -- 11. 2 Samuel 6, 6, 7. 2 Chronicles. 26, 16 -- 21. 1
King. 22.13, 14. Psalm. 19.7, 8, 9. and 119. and 132.9.16. Prove. 30, 5, 6. Esa.
8, 11 -- 20. and 33.22. and 55, 4. Ier. 1, 17, 18. 19. and 6, 13, 14, 16. and
23, chapter Ezech. 2, 6, 7, 8. and 3 chap. Mich. 2, 11. and 3, 5, 8. Rev. 22, 18,
19.

I. Because the Pastors and ministers of the church are by Christ given to the
church for the work of the ministry, and are by their office the household
stevvards and dispensers of the mysteries of God. And it is required in
stewards, that a man be found faithful. Ephesians. 4, 11, 12, 13. 1 Cor. 4, 1, 2.
Luke 12 42 -- 48. and 19.12 -- 26. 1 Timothy 3, 15. and 5, 17 -- 21. 2 Cor. 5, 20.
Col. 4, 17.

II. And Christ's commission, and charge which he has straightly given to his
Ministers, is, to teach and observe al things whatsoever he has commanded
them, and neither to add thereunto, nor to diminish therefrom: but to keep
this his commandment without spot and unrebukeable, until that his glorious
appearing. To which commandment also he has annexed a promise of assistance
and blessing, to such as shall be sincere and faithful herein; and a
denunciation of judgment and curse upon such as are unfaithful and disobedient
hereunto. Mat. 28.20. 1 Timothy 6.13.14. Ezec. 2.6.7.9. and 3.10.11.17. etc. Mat
25.14 -- 30. Col. 4.17. 1 Timothy 5.17. Rev. 2. and 3 chapter and 22.18.19.

III. The ministers of Christ must therefore even unto kings and princes, to
Priests and people, to high and low, of all estates and conditions, make
known the will of God, show them their sins, denounce Gods judgments
against them, and in all things fulfill and execute all the duties of their
office and functions, as there is need, and just occasion. So far ought they to
be, from performing their ministry, and duties of their calling, according
to the prescription or pleasure of man: but only according to the will and
word of God. And that so, as we ought not to be moved with any afflictions or
troubles in this behalf, neither to count our lives dear unto us, so as we
may finish our course with joy, and the ministry which we have received of
the Lord Jesus, to testify the Gospel of the grace of God: not shunning to
declare the whole counsel of God, that we may be pure from the blood of all
men. Ier. 1.17.18.19. Ezech. 3.16 -- 21, Hos. 5.1. 1 Samuel 15.13 -- 23. 2 Samuel
12.1 -- 14. 1 King. 18.17.18. and 21.17 -- 24. 2 Chronicles. 26.16 -- 20. with Deuteronomy.
33.8 -- 11. Mat. 10.16.17.18.28.32. 33.37 -- 39. and 14.3.4. and 23.13 -- 39.
Act. 9.15.16. and 20.24 -- 28. 1 Timothy 1, 3.^. and 5.1.2.20.21. and 6.13.14.17.
2 Timothy 4.1 -- 5. Tit. 2.15. Rev. 2, and 3 chapter and 12. 8 -- 11. etc. And if all
that will follovv Christ, must cast their account what it will stand them in
so to do, and must neither love father nor mother, wife nor children, brethren
nor sisters, lands nor goods, no nor their own life, in this behalf; but must
be content to leave and forsake all, if they will be Christ's disciples: how
much more should the Ministers of Christ be careful hereof, who are to be
guides and examples to the flock, of all godliness, patience, and faithfulness to
the end? Luke 14, 26 -- 33. and 18.18 -- 30. with 1 Timothy 4.12 -- 16. 2 Timothy
2.1.2, 3. and 3.10 -- 12. and 4.5.7.16.17.18. 1 Pet. 5.1 -- 4. Rev. 2.8 -- 11.

IIII. And herein we have the examples of the godly ministers and servants of
God in all ages; who being faithful to God, and performing the duties of
their calling according to his word, received comfort, strength, and blessing
from the Lord, in the midst of all the opposition made against them by any
means. 1 King. 22, 13 -- 28. 2 Chronicles. 16, 7 -- 10. and 24.17 -- 22. and 25,
14.15, 16. and 26, 17 -- 20. Ezra 9. and 10 chapter Esa. 8, 11 -- 20. and 50, 4 --
9. Ier. 15, 10-21. and 26, 8 -- 24. and 37, 6 -- 21. and 38, chapter and 39, 11, 12
-- 14. and 40, 1 -- 6. Micah 3, 8 -- 12. Zach. 3 chapter Act. 4. and 5, and 12, and
16. chapter etc. 2 Timothy 4, 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18. Rev. 2, 7, 10, 13. and 7, 7, 10,
11, 12. and 17, 14. For which also see the histories of the Martyrs. Besides
the contrary examples of such, as being not careful, or faithful to God in his
service, to minister according to his word, have had heavy judgments come
upon them. Which also are written, for instruction and example to all others.
Lev. 10, 1, 2, 3 Number. 16 chapter 1 Samuel 2, 13-36. and 3, and 4 chapter 2 Samuel 6, 6, 7.
1 King. 13 chap. Jer. 28, and 29 chapter Hos. 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Amos 7, 10 -- 17.
Mal. 1, 6 -- 14. and 2, 1 -- 9. Mat. 23, 13 -- 36. 2 Cor. 11, 13, 14, 15. 2
Pet. 2, 1, 2, 3, etc. And memorable is the example of Saul (though a king) who
doing that which pleased the people, and seemed good in his own eyes,
contrary to the word of God: is therefore sharply reproved by Samuel the
Prophet, and severely punished by the Lord. 1 Samuel 15, 13 -- 24.

V. Moreover, the Scriptures alone are sufficient, for the direction of the
Pastors and other officers administration: being given by inspiration of God,
and profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction
in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, and thoroughly furnished to
every good work. 2 Timothy 3, 15, 16. Psa. 19, 7, 8, 9. And Christ himself (who
alone is the head and Lavvgiver of his church) has left sufficient direction
in his word, both for the faith, and for the order of his church. Neither may
any men whosoever super ordeyn to his Testament, nor any way disanull it, or
add thereunto. Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20. Ephesians. 1, 22, 23. Col. 2, 2 -- 23. Esa.
33, 22. Heb. 3, 1, 2, 3. and 12, 25 -- 29. with Gal. 3, 15. and Rev. 22, 18, 19.

VI. Otherwise the Pastors and other Officers of the Church should sin not
only against God, but also against themselves, and against the Princes,
Prelates, and people whomsoever, whose prescription and pleasure they should so
follovv. And that both in making them to be the Lords of our religion, and in
corrupting them, or suffering them to be corrupted by themselves and others, in
religion and conversation, and so to be in continual danger to be seduced and
drawn into errors, heresies, superstititions, and iniquities, etc. Whereas
the Ministers and Officers of Christ should in all things be careful so to
walk, as they may be means and instruments (under God) to bring them to the
obedience of Christ in this life, and to eternal salvation by him in the life
to come. Ezec. 3, 16 -- 21. and 33, 1 -- 9. Mark 8, 34-38. 1 Samuel 2, 12 -- 36.
and 4 chap. 2 King. 16, 10 -- 16. with 2 Chronicles. 28, 23. Dan. 6, 10 -- 22.
Psalm. 2, 10, 11, 12. and 132, 9, 16. Deu. 33, 8, 9, 10. (...). 1, 17, 18. Mal.
1, 6 -- 14. and 2, 1 -- 9. 1 Cor. 4, 1, 2. Gal. 1, 10. 1 Timothy 4, 16.

VII. Neither should they else be blamed (as they are for the neglect hereof, if
it were not their duty, and in the power of their office, to perform and
fulfill it in the Lord. Rev. 2, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20. etc. with 1 Samuel 3, 13, 14.
and 2, 12 -- 36. Ezech. 13, and 33, and 34 chapter Hos. 4, 6, 8, 9. Mal. 1, 6 --
14. and 2, 1 -- 9. and with 2 Chronicles. 26, 16 -- 20. Luke 12, 42 -- 48. Act. 13,
25. Col. 4, 17.

VIII. Else also the ministers and other Officers of the church, should not now
at this time be as straightly bound to be faithful to the Lord in their
functions and in the ministration thereof, Heb. 3, 1, 2, 3. and 13, 7, 8, 17.
with Deu. 33, 8, 9.12. Mal. 1, 6 -- 14. and 2, 7.
as were the Priests and other Officers of Israel heretofore: Nor as were Act.
20, 17, 28 -- 32. Call. 4, 17. 1 Timothy 6, 13, 14. 1 Pet. 1, 1 -- 4. Rev. 2, and 3
chap.
the ministers and other officers in the Primitive churches, vvhiles the
Apostles lived. Which is contrary to the Scriptures,

IX. Lastly, they could not else discharge the duties which God has laid upon
them, so as to give account thereof, with comfort, to God, at that day: when
the Lord will graciously revvard all such as have been faithful unto him, and
severely punish them that have dealt unfaithfully in his service and work,
committed unto them. Mat. 25, 14 -- 30. 2 Cor. 5.9, 10, 11. 2 Timothy 4, 1, 2.
Heb. 13, 17. 1 Pet. 5, 1-4. Dan. 12, 3. Rev. 2, 10 and 22.16-20.

Chrysostom speaking to those that ministered the communion, says, No small
punishment hangs over you, if knowing any man to be wicked, you suffer him to
be partaker of this Table. His blood shall be required at your hands. If he be a
Captain, a Consul, or a crowned King that comes unworthily, forbid him, and
keep him off: thy power is greater then his. And again, I will yield my life
rather, then the Lords body to any unworthy person; and suffer my blood to be
shed, before I will grace that sacred blood to any, but to him that is worthy.
Chrysostom. homil. 83. in Mat 26. Many the like things about the Sacraments and
censures, might be showed out of the ancient writers. But to let them alone:
the Scripture is evident and undeniable, that Iehojadah the Priest set porters
at the gates of the Lords house, that none which was unclean in any thing,
should enter in. 2 Chronicles. 23, 19. Also, that Azariah the chief Priest, and the
other Priests with him, would not suffer Vzziah the king of Judah to burn
incense to the Lord; yea and when he was stricken with leprosy, thrust him
out of the Temple, 2 Chronicles. 26, 16 -- 20. Thus the Apostle likewise charge
Timothee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect Angels, that he
observe the things prescribed in that Epistle, without preferring one before
another, and without partiality. 1 Timothy 5.21. And that he should keep this
commandment without spot and unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord
Jesus Christ. 1 Timothy 6, 13, 14. Which Timmothee could not do in his own
person, being but to serve his time, and then to depart out of this life: but
thus the Apostle taught, that those commandments were prescribed, not for him
only, but for those also that should succeed afterward in the ministry and
government of the church, until the appearing of Christ our Lord, even to the
end of the world. Which yet further appears, in that Christ does so plainly
and particularly blame the Angels and Pastors of the Churches in Asia, because
they ^uffered false teachers and corrupt livers in the churches, and did not
restreine and repress them, as they ought to have done, according to the
duty and power of the office laid upon them by the Lord. Rev. 2, 14, 20, etc.
with Act. 20, 17, 28 -- 30. 1 Timothy 1, 3. and 5, 17 -- 25. and 6, 13, 14. Tit.
2, 15. But of these things I have spoken before, and shall have occasion
hereafter to note somewhat more again thereabout.

CHAPTER V. Touching the distinction of the Pastors and Teachers offices.
Whether we should not (in I speak not here, of Schools or Universities in
particular,
the church) put difference betvveen the Pastors and Teachers offices.

I. Because the Pastors and Teachers now in the church, are answerable to the
Priests and The Leviticall teachers.
Levites in Israel, for sundry things of perpetual equity and morality: and
are sometimes by the Prophets accordingly styled and signified by their names.
Esa. 66, 21. compared with Ephesians. 4, 11, 12. Romans 12, 7, 8. and 15, 16. 1 Cor.
9, 13, 14. And al acknowledge that the Priests and Levites had not the same
peculiar office and function, nor the same or like equal authority in the
church of Israel, and in the administration of the holy things of God. Number. 16,
8, 9, 10, 40. and 18, 1, 2, 3. with 3, and 4 chap. 2 Chronicles. 29, 16, 34.

II. Secondly, the Offices of the Pastors and Teachers, are themselves diverse
functions, given to the church by Christ the Lord; and accordingly had in the
Primitive churches. Ephesians. 4, 11. 1 Cor. 12, 5, 8. with Romans 12, 7, 8.

Object. But the Apostle in Ephesians. 4, 11. seems rather to join them together
as one, by the conjunction copulative KAI, And: then to distinguish them, as
being several, the one from the other.

Answ. This conjunction also is sometimes used for a discretiue, in divisions,
and in the shutting up of distributions. As the same Apostle uses it
otherwhere Gal. 3, 8. when he says, There is neither Jew, nor Greek, there is
neither bo^d nor free, there is neither male nor female, etc. where word for
word it is, neither male and female: But [and] is used here distributiuely: and
so is understood and translated, neither male nor female, according to the
distributions used before in the same sentence. And thus in the place to the
Ephesians, the Syriack translation (which is most ancient) uses a
distributive particle: distinguishing asvvell between Pastors and Teachers, as
between Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists. Ephe. 4, 11, in Syri^^. translat.
Not to speak of the Hebrew conjunction VAU, And: which the Scripture also often
uses for a discretiue, as in Exo. 21, 15, 17. Deu. 17, 9, 12. Besides that the
like manner of speech is used, in Genesis 1.14. and Hos. 3, 4. etc.

III. Thirdly, the holy Ghost (bestowing the gifts of God, and dividing them to
every man severally, as he will distributeth diverse and distinct gifts unto
men, for the performance of the duties of these offices aforesaid. 1 Cor. 12,
4, 8, 11.

IIII. Fourthly, God works diversely by these offices and gifts, bestowed on
his church. 1 Cor. 12, 6, 7, 11, 18, etc.

V. And Christ the Lord, lays diverse works and administrations upon these
offices and ministers themselves: besides the duties that are common to them
both. viz. Upon the Pastors, that they should in their ministry more
particularly use the speech of wisdom, and together with doctrine exhort,
rebuke, comfort, and vvisely apply the word of God (as there is occasion) to
the diverse uses, necessities, and conditions of the church and people; that
they should also administer the Sacraments and seals of Gods grace annexed to
his word and promise; execute the censures and sanctions of his word and
judgments; and alvvaies stir up al, of all sorts, to godliness, righteousness,
and sobriety; and defend the truth of God against all adversaries; and finally
to govern the Church in all things (according to the duty of their calling)
carefully, vvisely, and faithfully, under Jesus Christ, the Lord and Archpastor
of his church and people. 1 Cor. 12, 5, 8. with Romans 12, 8. Ephesians. 4, 11, 12.
with Esa 66, 21. 2 Chro. 13.10, 11. and 15, 3. 1 Cor. 10, 16, 21. and 11, 23 --
26. with Mat. 26, 26, 27, 28. and Eze. 44, 15, 16, 23, 24. Lev. 10, 9, 10. Number.
6, 23 -- 27. Joh. 20, 19 -- 23. with Mat. 16, 19. and 23, 34. and 24, 45. and
28, 18, 19, 20. Epist. to Timoth. and Titus. Heb, 13, 7, 17. ^ Pet. 5, 1 -- 4.
Rev. 1, 12, 13, 16, 20. and 2, 1. etc. All which things may well be included
and comprised in the very name of a Pastor. Which is the more to be observed,
both for the similitude of the Shepherds, whence it is taken; and because the
names of Offices used in the Scripture, do fitly note out the nature and
duties of the Offices themselves, sometimes in one respect, sometimes in
another.

Upon the Teachers also the Lord has laid, that they should in their
ministry specially use the speech of knowledge, and instruct the Church out
of the word of God; interpreting the Scriptures, teaching the knowledge of the
truth, which is according to godliness, catechizing the people, elder and
younger (as there is occasion) confuting errors, convincing adversaries, and
performing all those things that more specially perteyne to the delivering and
defending of the doctrine of God faithfully and syncerely, under Christ the
great Prophet and Teacher of his church and people. 1 Cor. 12, 5, 8, 28, 29.
with Romans 12, 7. Ephesians. 4, 11, 12. with Esa. 66, 21. and 30, 20. Neh. 8, 8, 9.
Deuteronomy. 33, 8, 10. with Number. 16, 8, 9, 10. Gal. 6, 6. Prove. 22, 6, 20, 21. Esa
28, 9, 12. Heb. 5, 12. and 6, 1, 2. Matthew. 13, 52. and 23, 34. Luke 2, 46. and
4, 16 -- 24. and 5, 17. and 13, 33. with Deuteronomy. 18, 15 -- 22. Act. 5, 34. and
8, 30.31 -- 35. and 13.1. and 15, 35. 1 Timothy 1, 3, 4, 7. and 2, 7. and 3, 2.
and 5, 17. 2 Timothy 1, 11, 13. and 4, 1, 2, 3. Tit. 1, 5, 9. etc. And these
things may well be implied in the name of a Teacher.

But whether more is to be required of them as they are Teachers, may further
be considered. As also that of old in the Church of Israel they might have
Teachers, who were not Sacrificers: and whether likewise they might not have
Teachers, that were not Rulers or governors among they unles they were also
chosen to government besides. Deuteronomy 33.8, 10. Neh 8, 8, 9. with Numb. 16, 8, 9,
10. and 18, 1 -- 7. 1 Chronicles. 6, 48, 49. Amo^ ^^, 12 -- 15. Mat. 13, 52. and 23,
34. Luke 2, 46. and 5, 17. compared with 2 Chronicles. 17, 7, 8, 9. John 3, 1, 10.
and Act. 5, 34.

Finally, for the distinction betvveen the Pastors and Teachers office, observe
how Ambrose, repeating the place of Ephesians. 4, 11. says thereon: I do neither
challenge the glory of the Apostles; for who will do that, but those whom the
^^me of God himself chose? nor the grace of the Prophets, nor the virtue of the
Evangelists, nor the circumspection of the Pastors; but I desire only to
obtain intension and diligence about the divine Scriptures: which the Apostles
placed last among the offices of the Saints: and ^^^n this that studying to
teach, I may learn, Ambros. off. l. 1. c. 1. For which also see, Gregor^e
Nazianzen de mod. And, Jerome, who likewise distinguish the Pastor and Doctor,
Ephesians. 4, 11.

And among the later Writers, Calvin in his Institutions treating of the
ministers of the church, and on Ephesians. 4.11. after he has spoken of the
Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, coming to speak of the Pastors and Teachers,
says thus: There follow the Pastors and Teachers, whom the church can never
want: among whom there is this difference, that the Teachers are not set over
the discipline, nor the administration of the Sacraments, nor admonitions or
exhortations; but over the interpretation of the Scripture, that the doctrine
may be kept sincere and sound among the faithful. But the Pastors office
conteyneth all these things in it. Calvin. Institut. lib. 4. cap. 3. sect. 4.
And a little after, comparing together those functions that are spoken off, Ephesians.
4, 11. he says: As the Teachers are answerable to the ancient Prophets there
spo^en off) so are the Pastors to the Apostles: except that these have their
certain peculiar churches assigned unto them. Ibid. sect. 5.

Piscator also has the like: who first notes this, that the Lord at the
beginning of his kingdom raised up Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists: by
whom when the Churches were founded and planted, he appointed in their place
Teachers and Pastors perpetually to endure: And then puts the same
difference between these Offices, and in the same words, as Calvin does here
before. Piscat. Aphorism. cap. 20. sect, 8. and 12.

Beza like wise in his Annotations on Romans 12, 7. making this difference
betvveen them, notes it thus: The Apostle calls him a Teacher, who in the
church attends only to the simple interpretation of the Scripture, that the
doctrine may be kept pure and sincere. And the Exhorter, who otherwhere is
termed a Pastor, he calls him ^^at ^^yneth doctrine together with admonitions
and exhortations, and also with the administration of the Sacraments. Beza in
Romans 12, 7. Vrsinus notes the same difference betvveene these Offices. Vrsin.
Catec. part. 3. writing on the fourth Commandment: (...) the Ministry,
quest. 2.

So does M. Fenner also in his Theology, where he vvriteth thus: The Teachers
are they, which are employed privately and publicly, in delivering of doctrine
faith^^^^ touching all duties both common and proper. Nehem. 8.9. Luke 5, 17.
Romans 12, ^. 1 C^^ 12 8. The Pastors, are they which are employed in applying
the word with wisdom to al duties (...) proper and common. Romans 12, 7, 8. 1
Cor. 12, 8. Wherefore besides exhortations, there is required of him that in
his public office, he apply the truth to the hearts of men, by the
administration of the seals. Lev. 10.9.10 2 Chronicles. 13, 10. Rom, 12, 5 -- 8.
Ephesians. 4, 11. Fenne^. The^^. lib. 7. cap. 7. Diverse others have written in like
sort hereabout: which I leave to the observation of the Reader.

CHAPTER VI. Of the having of one or more Pastors, in particular Churches. Also
of Diocesan and Provincial Bishops, etc.
Whether it be not most according to the ordinance of God, that in every
particular church, there be Rev. 2, 1, 8, 12, 18. and 3 1, 7, 14. and 22,
16-19. with Phil. 4, 3. Col. 4, 16, 17. and Act. 21, 18. Luc. 12, 42. 1 Timothy
1, 3. and 3, 15. and 5, 19 -- 22. and 6, 13, 14.
one Pastor or Angel of the church (so properly and specially called) and
diverse teachers and ruling Elders (according to the condition of the church)
joined to the Pastor, in the ministry and government of the same church: who
may all of them also generally be called Pastors: yet so, as one be specially
distinguished from the rest, in respect of his place and function, to be the
Pastor (...) more particularly called) under Jesus Christ the Archpastor. Or,
whether there being many Elders appointed to feed, instruct, and govern the
Church, they should be all alike, or of one sort, without any distinction of
Office or function among them.

Where touching the first point, these things, and the like may be considered.
I. The constitution of the Primitive churches, as they were established by the
Apostles. As namely, the churches of Ephesus, Smyrna, Colosse, Laodicea, etc.
Rev. 2, 1, 8, 12, 18. and 3, 1, 7, 14. and 22, 16-19. with Phil. 4, 3. Col. 4,
16, 17. and Act. 21, 18. Luc. 12, 42. 1 Timothy 1, 3. and 3, 15. and 5, 19 -- 22.
and 6, 13, 14. Act. 20, 17, 28. compared with Rev. 2, 1. and Ephesians. 4, 11, 12.
and 1 Timothy 1, 3. and 3, 1 -- 15. and 5, 17, 19, 21. Act. 11.30. and 13.1. and
14.23. and 15.2.6.22.23.35. and 16.4. and 21.18. Romans 12.7.8. 1 Cor. 12.5.8.28.
Phil. 1. 1. Col. 1.7. and 4.12.17. 1 These. 5.12.13.14.27. Tit. 1.5 -- 9. Heb.
13.7.17.24. Iam. 5.14. 1 Pet. 5.1 -- 4. And diverse things also hereabout, may
be noted in the ancient vvriters, who lived a while after the Apostles days:
This being still carefully observed vvithall (because the mystery of iniquity
began to work, even in the Apostles time, and the apostasy of Antichrist
spread abroad afterward more and more) that we insist no further nor otherwise
upon those Writers, in any points of religion, but as they agree with the
Scriptures, and in such things as are grounded thereupon.

Now therefore concerning the point in hand: Ignatius has often in his
Epistles, to the Churches to which he wrote, these and the like sayings* Let
all things be done of you, according to good order in Christ. Let the laymen
(or people) be subject to the Deacons, the Deacons to the Elders, the Elders to
the Bishop the Bishop to Christ, as he to his Father. And again, What is the
Eldership, but an ^^ly Senate, the Counselors and assistants of the Bishops?
Ignat. epist. ad Smyrn. ad T^^lenses, ad Antiochenos. and 3. ad Magnesios, etc.

And Iustine Martyr calls him TON PROESTOTA, the president or chief
governor, whom Ignatius, Irenaeus, Eusebius, and others call EPISCOPON, the
Bishop, or Overseer: so applying general terms, to this office more
particularly. Justin. Martyr. Apolog. 2.

Irenaeus writes of Polycarpus by name, that he was made Bishop by the
Apostles, in Asia, in the church of Smyrna. And that himself had seen him,
when he was young. Irenaeus, libr. 3. cap. 3. He also names sundry of the
Bishops of the Church of Rome, who succeeded one after another in that church,
from the Apostles times, to his own days. Ibid.

Eusebius writes likewise of Polycarpus, made Bishop of the church of Smyrna
by the Apostles ( Eusebius. l. 3. c. 32. and l. 4. c. 14.) and of many Bishops by
name, who follovved one another in the church of Rome, and in sundry other
churches, after the Apostles and Evangelists: which were long here to recite
in particular. Eusebius. lib. 3. c. 2.13.14.19.31.32. and lib 4. c. 1.4
5.10.19.22.23. etc. Only note these, for some special instances hereabout; In
the church of Alexandria, Anianus; and after him, Abilius, etc. Eusebius. l. 2^
24. and 3.13. In the church of Jerusalem, Simeon (after James the Apostle and
after him, Iustus, etc. Ibid. l. 3. c. 11. and. 32. In the church of Antioch,
(...); and after him, Ignatius, etc. Ibid. l. 3. c. 19. In the church of
Corinth, (...); and after him, Dionysius, etc Ibid. l. 4. c. 21. and 22. In the
church of Athens, Dionysius Areopagites; and after him, Quadratus Publius, etc.
Ibid. Where also observe, how Eusebius sometimes calls the churches,
parishes: As, the parish of Alexandria, the parish of Ephesus, the parish of
Jerusalem, the parish of Hierapolis, the parish of Athens, Of other
interpretation or application of the word [parish] I will not now insist nor of
the (...)
etc. whereof such and such (there named) were Bishops or Overseers, one after
another. Eusebius. l. 2. c. 24. and ^ 3. c. 4 11.28.32. and l. 4. c. 1.4.5.19.22.
Which is well to be noted for better observation, how every church or parish
had at the beginning their own Pastor or Bishop; and how those Bishops were
much unlike the Diocesan, Provincial, and Oecumenicall Bishops, had now a
days: who content not themselves with a parish or particular Church, but
chalendge (by virtue of such office) authority over whole Dioceses, Provinces,
and the universal world: as in the apostasy of Antichrist may be seen. And
thus much by the way, concerning the testimony of the ancient writers in this
behalf. Which I leave to be examined by the Scriptures, as is aforesaid.

II. Secondly, where the order is observed, which is mentioned in the
question here before, there may the difference be kept both between the Pastors
and Teachers offices; and betvveen the offices of the Teaching and ruling
Elders. Ephesians. 4, 11, 12. and 1 Timothy 5.17. with Rev. 2.1. and Romans 12.3 -- 8.
1 Cor. 12.5.8.28. etc. Which otherwise is either unknovven of many, and so
neglected; or else is confusedly carried, and corrupted, sundry ways.

III. A particular visible church may (in the outward constitution there of) be
considered, as a particular visible body. Now a particular visible body, has a
particular visible head. Which also is such, as cannot say to the feet or
inferior members, I have no need of you. 1 Cor. 12.18 -- 21. with E^a. 1, 5,
6. and Romans 12.3 -- 8. Col. 2.5. and 4.17. Rev. 2.1.8. etc. and with the
Epistles to Timothee and Titus.

And touching the word (head) thus taken and used in the Scripture, (for some
chief member or members, governor or governors, or any persons and things,
which excel or are before others, in dignity, office, age, authority, time,
place, or any special excellency:) see Exodus 6, 14. and 30.23. Numb. 1.3
4.16. and 7.2. Deuteronomy. 20.9. and 28.13.44. Josh. 23.2. and 2^, 1. 1 Samuel 15, 17.
2 Samuel 23, 8, 13, 18. 1 Chronicles 9.10 -- 13. and 24, 4, 6, 31. Neh. 11, 16. and
12.7, 12, 22, 23, 24. Esa. 1, 5, 6. and 7, 8. and 9, 14, 15. and 29, 10. Ezec.
21, 26. and ^^, 2, and 40, 1. Mic. 3, 3, 9, 11. Ier. 13, 21. 1 Cor. 12, 21.

And note, that here I speak only of particular churches, as they are
organicall, and set in an orderly visible constitution: and so of the outvvard
order, and diverse functions set in the church by the Lord himself: and that I
speak not of the church, as it is the mystical body of Christ; nor of the
spiritual and quickening head of the church, and of all the members thereof
wheresoever. Which is Christ alone: and unto whom alone this apperteyneth, and
to none other whosoever besides. Ephesians. 1.22.23. and 4, 15, 16. and 5.23. Col.
1.18. and 2.19. 1 Cor. 12.12. compared with Jer. 33.16.

Note also how both ancient and later vvriters do thus use the same word,
and likewise apply it. Chrysostom speaking of the return of the Bishop, when
himself was an Elder at Antioch, says, Blessed be God, that has restored the
head to the body, the Pastor to the sheep, etc. Chrysostom. homil. 20. ad populum
Antiochenum. Basil vvriting to the church of Neocaesarea, upon the death of
their Bishop, says, The church closes her eyes, the solemn assemblies look
heavily, the sacred Synedrion (Presbytery or Eldership) desire their head; they
that are in dignity their leader, the people their ruler. Basil. epist. 62. ad
Eccles Neocasarien^ Among later vvriters, D. Raynolds conferring with Heart,
says: We teach that Apolog. Eccl. Ang. confess. Helvet. c. 17.
Christ is the head of the church, as he does quicken it with his spirit, as
he is the light, the health, the life of it: and is present alvvaies to fill it
with his blessings, and with his grace to govern it. In the which respects,
because Ephesians. 1.22. and 4.15. and 5.23. Col. 1.18. and 2.19, and so the church
his body.
the Scripture gives the name of head to Christ alone, by an excellency:
thereof we so conclude, that he is the only head of the church. For
otherwise, we know, that (in another kind and degree of resemblance) they
may be called heads, who have any preeminence of place or government over
others. As in the Hebrew text we read Nehem- 11.16.
the heads of the Levites, for the chief of them: and, 2 Chro. 31 10.
the Priest the head, that is to say, the chief Priest. After the which sort, I
will not contend, if you entitle Bishops heads of the churches, as In Apolog. 2.
Athanasius does; and In Regist. lib. 4. epist. 38.
Gregory, when he had named our Savior Christ, the head of the universal
church, he calls Christ's Ministers, as it were heads: Paul, Andrew, John,
heads of particular flocks, yet members of the church, and under one head. Rayn
conference with Heart. chap. 1, Divis. 2. page 20. And M. Jacob in his
Attestation vvriteth thus hereabout: M. Gabr. Powel makes it an heresy in the
Pope, to hold as he does, that in the visible church there ought to be a
visible head. What do I hear? A visible Body instituted by Christ without a
visible head? A church and no Pastor? A multitude to be governed, and no
Governor? These are strange assertions, whosoever, and how many soever do
affirm them. For I grant there are not a few others which use so to speak.
But indeed there is no color of truth, nor reason in these sayings. M. Jacobs
Attestat. chapter 7. p. 113. And a little after again, What shall we think? Has
Christ left his body, and dear spouse without help, without government in
such daily and continual necessities? Or can an ordinary body be governed
without an ordinary head? To use D. Bilsons words, Perpet. go^. p. 37^.
this were an heathenish if not a hellish confusion. Ibid. p. 114. He also
that vvrote the Manudunction, has the like, when he says: A visible church
must be considered as an integrall body: which for the well being of it
exercising those operations which belong unto it, and whereunto in serves,
must become as we say organicall, having members of diverse ranks, some as head,
mouth, and eyes the Pastor, Teachers, and Elders; some as hands, the Deacons
and helpers, etc. Manuduct. 2. page 33.

IIII. Here moreover may be considered the order observed in the church of
Israel: so far forth as it was moral, and concerns particular churches; and
the constitution of the Synagogues, wherein (besides the other officers) was
M. Brou. on Rev. 9. and 14. p. 83. 223. M. Ainsw defense of Scrip. page 113.
one, vvho^ they called SHELIACH TSIBBVR, the ambassador or Messenger of the
congregation. To which, or the like, Christ might have reference, when he
speaks of the Angel of each particular church in Asia, Rev. 2.1.8.12.18. and
3.1.7.14. And of the term Angel, ascribed to the ministers of the Lord, see
also Hag. 1.13. Mal. 2.7. where we find the Prophets and Priests in Israel,
called the Angels or Messengers of the Lord. As the Jews also still make two
sorts of Angels: One of them whom they call GNELIONIM, because they have their
dwelling in the high places, that is, in the heavens: and the other of them
whom they call TACHTONIM, as it were lower or inferior. And such are the
Prophets and Priests: says Drusius (alleging this) in his Annotations on the
New Testament, Rev. 1.20. Besides that in the families and tribes of Israel,
and among the Priests and Levites also, they had an orderly constitution, and
(according to the distribution of them) some that were heads and chief among
them. As may be seen in the Scriptures here before alleged: p. 263.

V. Order it self likewise (besides necessity often falling out) requires,
that there be some one, who in regard of his place, office or condition, may
call together the other Elders, and unto whom they may resort: Who also with
them may call the whole church together, as there is occasion: And of whom
the chief or special oversight of the Church; the moderation and disposition
of the affairs thereof, may be required: To whom moreover the letters may be
directed and delivered, and other special things shevved and advertised, which
perteyne to the general or public estate of the church: as we see was done
by Christ himself, to the Angels of the seven churches in Asia: Rev. 2.1.8.
etc. whereabout also the Epistles sent to Timothee and Titus may have their due
consideration in this behalf: and that which is noted concerning James and the
Elders of the church at Jerusalem, Act. 21.18. with 2 King. 6, 32.

And hereunto do thus far forth the most learned agree, in the Reformed
churches; albeit that yet themselves (many of them have not one particular
Pastor in their several churches. M. Beza answering Saravia, affirms, *
that by Gods perpetual ordinance, it has been, is, and will be needful, Beza
respons. ad Sarav c. 23 fol. 153.
that in the Presbytery or Eldership, some one chief in place and dignity,
should govern and rule the actions, with that right which is given unto him of
God. Otherwise let it be well considered, whether there would not be some
defect in the order and constitution of the church: Which seeing it is ordained
by Christ the Lord, it is certainly most perfect in it self (if we could aright
observe it) and every way absolute. And how profitable and needful the
observation of this matter is, may moreover then easily be perceived, when
controversies arise (as diverse times comes to pass) either among the Elders
alone, or in the church it self. Besides that the continual oversight and care
of other the churches affairs, and the due administration of the holy things
of God, in all good sort, may thus be rightly performed, and agreably to the
word of God.

VI. To the same end may more specially be observed the estate of the church of
Ephesus, in the Apostles times: The Overseers and Elders of which church are,
in four several places spoken of in special manner: viz. Act. 20, 17, 28.
Ephesians. 4, 11, 12. with 1, 1. 1 Timothy 5, 17. with 1, 3. and 3, 1, 15. Rev. 2,
1. with 1, 11, 16, 20. In the first of which places, viz. Act. 20, 17, 28. the
Elders are generally spoken off, without the noting of any particular
distinction among them. Only their works and duties are comprised in the
general terms of taking heed to themselves and the whole flock; of being
Overseers; and of feeding the church of God. Which general terms comprehend
in them, all the duties of all the Elders, though otherwise and otherwhere
distinct one from another. In the second place, viz. Ephesians. 4, 11, 12, there is
speech only of the ministers of the word, and among them, of the Pastors and
Teachers, which are for the work of the ministry more particularly. In the
third place, viz. 1 Timothy 5, 17. there is mention moreover of two sorts of
Elders, the Ruling Elders, and the Teaching Elders; and those also distinct the
one from the other. In the fourth and last place, viz. Rev. 2, 1. there is
mention in particular of the Angel of the church of Ephesus: whom Beza
understands and expounds to be, the President, who was first to have
warning of those things, and by him the rest of his Colleages and the whole
church. Bez. annot. in Rev. 2, 1. So Piscator likewise expounds it, To the
Angel, that is, to the Bishop of the church of Ephesus: and also to the church
it self: as appears by the words, ver. 7. Piscat. Analys. and Schol. in Apoc.
2, 1. Napier says: To the Angel, that is, to the Pastor or Minister of the
church of Ephesus. Napier in Rev. 2, 1. And Bullinger says, The Angels are the
Ambassadors of God, even the Pastors of the churches. Bulling. concion. 6. in
Apoc. And again, speaking of the church of Smyrna, he says, The heavenly
letter is directed to the Angel of the church of Smyrna, that is, to the
Pastor. Now the stories witness that Angel and Pastor of the church of Smyrna
to have been Polycarpus, ordained Bishop of the Apostles themselves, I mean, by
S. John. Ibid. concione 9. Also among the elder writers, Augustine says, By
the divine voice the Ruler of the Church of Ephesus is praised under the name
of an Angel. August. epist. 162. And Gregory says, The Preachers in the
Scriptures are sometimes called Angels, as the Prophet says, Mal. 2.7.
the lips of the Priest should keep knowledge, and they should seek the Law
at his mouth: for he is the Angel or Messenger of the Lord of hosts. Gregor.
moralium in Job. lib. 11. c. 3. Thus much briefly I thought to note in
particular touching the estate of the Church of Ephesus, and the Bishops or
Overseers thereof: which being four several times spoken of in the Scripture,
and that also with such different manner of speech, as is aforesaid: may help
to give good light and direction unto us about the question in hand.

VII. Finally, if the foresaid order be kept, we may by the word of God
sufficiently answer all the objections, and meet with all the corruptions of
the Prelates, or any other, that err in this behalf from the simplicity and
first constitution of the primitive churches. Which how it can otherwise in
deed so well and soundly be done, had need duly to be considered of all that
bear witness against them.

And hitherto concerning the first branch of this question. Now for the other
point of the question, there is alleged about it both Scripture, M. Sm.
differ. page 23 etc. M. Parker Polit. eccles l. 3. c. 18. p. 236. etc.
and record of ancient writers. The Scriptures are these, and the like, Act.
20.17.28. Phi. 1.1. 1 These. 5.12. 1 Timothy 3. and Tit. 1 chapter 1 Pet. 5.1 -- 4.
Which are alleged, to show that the Primitive Churches had many Elders in one
church (which is granted) and those also all alike; and therefore that they
had not one special Pastor, nor (as some think) such distinction of teaching
and ruling Elders, as is aforesaid. The record of the ancient Writers produced
also thereabout, is to show that sometimes there were two Bishops at once, in
one church. Of which more hereafter.

1. Now first for the Scriptures (leaving the point, for the truth thereof, so
to be esteemed, as it shall be found to be grounded on the Scriptures duly
considered) there is alleged, Act. 20, 17, 28. whereby is gathered: First,
that there were many Elders in the Church of Ephesus (there spoken off) and
not one Pastor alone. Which I think none of sound judgment will deny.
Secondly, that the Elders were all alike, and of one sort, etc. Which if it
were so, then 1. how is it, that the Apostle vvriteth to Timothee (whom he
left with the Church of Ephesus) both of teaching and of ruling Elders, and the
one differing from the other? 1 Timothy 5, 17. compared with 1 Timothy 1, 3.

2. What then also or where is the difference betweeene the Pastors, and
Teachers, spoken off to the same church of Ephesus? Ephesians. 4.11.12.

3. And who is the Angel of this church of Ephesus, spoken of, Rev. 2.1.

4. Or where are the ruling Elders called the Angels of the Lord, or of the
church, as the Prophets, Priests, and ministers of the Gospel are, Hag. 1.13.
Mal. 2.7. with Rev. 1.20. and 2.1.8. etc.

5. And why may we not think, that there were both teaching and ruling Elders
in the Church of Ephesus, asvvell as in other of the Primitive churches, as may
appear by that which is written, Romans 12, 7, 8. and 1 Cor. 5.8.28. compared
with 1 Timothy 5.17. and with the practice and estate of Israel, Jer. 19, 1. Luke
22, 66. with 2 King. 6, 32. and 2 Chronicles. 19, 8, etc.

6. And that there was also some one in the church of Ephesus (as Archippus in
the church of Colosse, Col. 4, 17. and Polycarpus, as diverse write, in the
church of Smyrna (spoken off, Rev. 2, 8.) Irenaeus l. 3. c. 3. Eusebius. l. 3. c.
32. and l. 4. c. 14. etc.) to whom Christ directed his letters, and of whom he
straightly required to look to the contents thereof: To redress errors and
abuses in the church, etc.
the matters being all of them such, as the Pastor, who has special charge of
the flock, should carefully regard and observe, according to the duty of his
office, under the Archpastor Jesus Christ. Rev. 2.1. etc.

7. To which end may also be observed, that seven stars, are spoken off,
ansvverably to the number of the seven golden Candlesticks: and that three
times, one after another, Rev. ^.12.13.16. Also Rev. 1.20. And Rev. 2.1.
Besides the mention again of seven stars, together with mention of the seven
Spirits of God. Revel. 3.1. Which whether it may not in some respects be
observed, for the other point, and diverse other good purposes also, let it be
duly considered.

8. And hereunto agrees the testimony of the ancient writers (Irenaeus,
Eusebius, etc.) who make mention in particular of the names and succession of
diverse Bishops or Pastors (so specially called) following one another, from the
Apostles days, for a long time after: how ever in tract of time, corruption
grew in, and then from the oversight of one particular church, they became
Bishops of many churches, even of whole Dioceses and Provinces, etc.

9. And whereas it is alleged, that the Apostle gave not the Elders ( Act. 20,
17, 28.) several charges, as having several duties lying upon them, but one
general charge, common to them all, namely the duty of feeding, which is the
work of the Pastor, etc. there may also here about be considered, 1. that they
were in general al of them Bishops and Overseers of the flock and church of
Ephesus: and therefore might well have this charge given them in general, and
jointly together. And yet this not hinder, but that they might also in other
respect have distinction of place and function among themselves
notvvithstanding. As may be seen in other cases and general speeches used
often in the Scriptures: as in Deuteronomy. 33.8.10. Josh. 23, 2 and 24, 1, etc. 1 Chronicles. 28, 1, 2, etc. 2 Chronicles. 19, 5 -- 9. etc. Ier. 19, 1, 3. etc. Hos. 5, 1.
etc. And more especially, 2 Chronicles. 29, 3 4, 5. etc. where king Hezekiah gave a
charge jointly and in general terms, to the Priests and Levites (the
ministers of the Temple) for the sanctifying of themselves and purging of the
Temple. Yet who would thereupon conclude, that all the Levites were Priests;
or that there was no distinction betvveen their offices in other respects, or
that the ministers of the Temple were all alike, and of one sort? 2. All
things are not spoken in all places: and Scripture must be compared with
Scripture, for the right understanding thereof. When therefore other Scriptures
show a difference, we must thence learn it, and not because of some general
or other speeches, misconstrue or confound things, which the Scriptures
othervvhere teach us aright to distinguish. Otherwise men might infer upon
Moses general speech, Deu. 33, 8, 10. that all the Levites might burn incense
before the Lord, and that therefore Corah the Levite sinned not in so doing:
Number. 16 chapter Which were indeed to pervert the Scripture, and not to understand
it aright. 3. Though a speech be general, and such as may in some respects
perteine unto all, yet may it also be sufficient for their understanding and
stirring up, who otherwise know themselves well the distinction of their
places or offices one from another, and what apperteyneth to their several
duties thereabout. Like as the Levites, who, although Hezekiahs speech
aforesaid was general, and was made unto them together with the Priests, yea
though the Temple was now polluted, yet kept themselves within their bounds,
and did not so much as go into the inner part of the Temple, that apperteyned
to the Priests done. 2 Chronicles. 29, 16. 4. The term of feeding, and the word
Pastor, and other the like (both in Scripture, and in other writers) are used
sometimes largely and generally, sometimes strictly and particularly. In the
former understanding, are kings and Princes called Pastors, and said to feed, 1
Chro. 11, 2. Psalm. 78, 70, 71, 72. Esa 47, 28. Ier. 6, 3. and 13, 18, 20. and
22, 22. and 49, 19. and 50, 44. Ezech. 34, 2. Christ also, Ezech. 34, 23. and
37, 24. Zach. 13, 7. Ioh. 10, 11, 16. Heb. 13, 20. 1 Pet. 2, 25. and 5, 4. and
the Apostles, Ioh. 21, 16. and all governors both civil and ecclesiastical,
Jer. 3, 15. and 17, 16. and 23, 1, 2, 4. and 50, 6. Zach. 11, 5, 8. Act. 20,
17, 28. 1 Pet. 5, 1, 2. In the latter signification, it is used for the Pastors
and ministers, that are expressly distinguished from the Apostles, Prophets,
Evangelists, and Teachers, spoken of Ephesians. 4, 11, 12. and are also called
Exhorters, or Comforters, Romans 12, 8. to whom the wor^ of wisdom is ascribed,
1 Cor. 12, 8. As in Israel they had ministers that were called, Wise men,
Mat. 23, 34. So then in the general use of the word, all the Elders and
governors of particular Churches are Pastors, and do feed according to the
duty of their office, 1 Pet. 5.1, 2. Acts 20, 17, 28. And thus there were and
may be many Pastors in particular churches. But shall we therefore conclude,
that there was no particular office of Pastor in the churches; no difference
betvveen the teaching and ruling Elders; no distinction betvveen the Pastors
and Teachers office, etc.

10. Lastly, whereas others also allege this Scripture ( Act. 20, 17, 28. M.
Bright. on Rev. 2.1. etc.
) to show that by the Angel of the Church of Ephesus ( Rev. 2, 1.) is meant
the whole College of Pastors, Elders, and Bishops: let these reasons aforesaid
be well observed about that point also: for the better fynding out and clearing
of the truth in this behalf. And so I proceed to note somewhat likewise about
the other Scriptures before mentioned touching the matter in hand.

The other Scriptures are these, Phil. 1, 1. 1 These. 5, 12. 1 Timothy 3 chapter and
Tit. 1 chapter 1 Pet. 5, 1, 2. Which all of them have this common unto them, that
the like collections are made out of them, as out of Acts 20.17.28. And
therefore the same things may be observed about them, as have been noted here
already about Acts 20.17.28. That so I need not repeat the same things over
again and again. Only I will briefly annexe some few things more concerning
these Scriptures in particular.

2. With that place of Phi. 1.1. where the Apostle speaks of the Bishops of
that church, as being many: there may be compared another place in the same
epistle, where the Apostle says, I entreat thee also, true yokefellow. etc.
Phil. 4, 3. By which manner of speech, may be observed, that though there were
sundry Elders and Bishops in that church, yet there was notwithstanding also
some special man, whom the Apostle in special and more particularly called
his true yoke fellow. Whether it were the Pastor, or not, I will not determine.
And who it should be, rather then the Pastor (that by such a peculiar
attribute, without particular naming of him, should be intended by the Apostle,
and understood by them to whom he vvrote) I desire to have shevved by others.
The question that is made about the gender, is of no weight. For besides the
matter spoken off, and other circumstances of the place, the Syriak translation
puts the matter out of doubt, which has it thus, I entreat thee also, O
son of my yoke, etc. which shows both that he spoke of a man, and of one
that was of special note and employment. Tremellius and Iunius, in their notes
on the Syriak translation, expound it thus, The son of my yoke, that is,
partaker of the same yoke with me, which art my helper in the same
ministry. A metaphor taken from bulloks, who being put under the same yoke,
are used by men to one and the same ministry and service. Also Ignatius
writing to the church of Philippi, names Vitalis Bishop (or Pastor) of that
church. And here, in the Apostles next Epistle, which is to the Colossians, he
speaks of Archippus by name, touching the fulfilling of his ministry, in
the church of Colosse, Col. 4, 17.

3. The next Scripture, 1 These. 5, 12. as it shows that there were diverse
Elders in that church: so the words there used (of laboring, ruling or being
over them in the Lord, informing or admonishing them) may notwithstanding
imply, that there was distinction of place and office among them: as more
plainly appears, 1 Timothy 5, 17. where the like words are used, in the
Apostles speech concerning the Elders, and the distinction of their office and
duties: And as likewise may be observed in Hezekiahs speech to the priests and
Levites, and in the terms there used, though he spoke unto them jointly
together. 2 Chronicles. 29, 4, 5. compared with v. 11. Besides that Origin writes
of Gajus by name, reported to have been Bishop of the church of Thessalonica.
Origin. l. 10. in cap. 16. epist. ad Romanos.

4. Both the places in 1 Timothy 3. and Tit. 1 chapter show likewise, that there
were sundry Elders, in the churches of Ephesus and Crete. Yet this hinders
not, but that they had also difference of office and function among them, as
may appear by comparing 1 Timothy 5.17. Ephesians. 4, 11, 12. Rev. 2, 1. and Romans 12,
7, 8. 1 Cor. 12, 28. with the places aforesaid: and may be employed by the
particular properties and duties required of them: besides the estate and
practice of the church of Israel, which gives great light in this behalf, as
has been observed.

If any understand these places (in 1 Timothy 3. and Tit. 1 ch.) to speak of such
Elders only as were ministers, yet that will be no hinderance neither. For
seeing the Priests and Levites in Israel were all of the tribe of Levi, and
lineally descending one from another, according to their kindred: which now is
not so in the Pastors and Teachers (for a lineall descent, one of another
according to kindred, though otherwise they succeed and follovv one another in
their place and function:) and now the Pastors and Teachers are by the Lord
taken out of the Gentiles and become answerable to the Priests and Levites, (
Esa. 66, 18 -- 21. and Jer. 33, 15 -- 22.) therefore was it needful, that
there should in special manner be mention, in the Apostles vvritings, The like
may be observed about the Deacons: ^ho are in diver^ things much answerable to
the Levites in Israel: as to the Leviticall Treasurers, etc.
of their offices, and of their properties, qualities, and duties, etc. Which
needed not so much to be, about the ruling Elders chosen out of the people, who
are answerable to the like Elders in Israel (notwithstanding the differences
of estate) and are still to be endowed with like qualities, as those Elders
were: as may be seen by observing the qualities mentioned in Exodus 18, 21. and
Deuteronomy. 1, 13, 15, 16, 17. compared also with 1 Cor. 6, 5. and 12, 28. Romans 12.8.
1 Timothy 5, 17.

And here let it be considered, whether if a Synagogue of the Jews (or many
thereof were converted to the Christian faith, the rulers of the Synagogue
(becoming Christians) might not now be taken or kept still to be ruling Elders
of the church: (such as we read off, Acts 13, 15. and 18, 8. and Mar. 5.22,
etc. whereas the Priests and Levites coming to the faith (as diverse did, Acts
6, 7.) they were necessarily to leave their Leviticall office: and then, being
fit, might become ministers of the Gospel, and so continue in that
ministration and employment, as before they did in the other. Heb. 9, 6, 7. and
13, 10. with Acts 4, 36. and 11, 22 -- 26. and 13, 1 -- 5. etc. Romans 15, 16. 1
Cor. 9, 13, 14. and with Esa. 66, 21, 22, 23.

In which respects, let it also be observed, whether the difference should not
now in the church still carefully be kept betvveene the ruling Elders, and
betvveen the ministers of the Gospel, the Pastors and Teachers: as there was
heretofore in Israel betvveen the Elders of the people, and the ministers of
the Temple, the Priests and Levites. Exodus 18, 21. with 28 chap. Numb. 11, 16.
with 3, and 4, and 8, and 16, and 18 chapter Deu. 1, 13 -- 18. with 10.8. and 33,
8 -- 11. 2 Chro. 19, 5 -- 8 -- 11. Jer. 19, 1. Luke 22, 66. Act. 4, 5, 6. and
5, 21, 34. and 22, 5, 30. compared with 1 Timothy 5, 17. Romans 12, 7, 8. 1 Cor. 12,
28. Ephesians. 4, 11, 12, 13. Acts 20, 17, 28. Phil. 1, 1. Col 4, 17. 1 These, 5,
12, 13, 14. Hebr. 13, 7, 17. Rev. 2, 1. etc. And this, both for the difference
of the offices themselves, and of the duties and ministration thereof: and for
sundry other points and questions hereabout: and namely, for the continuance of
the ministers in their offices and functions; as did the Priests and Levites in
the ministry, though there be a yearly or other like change of the ruling
Elders: as is now observed among the Jews (touching the rulers of their
Synagogues) and is very usual in such policies as are Aristocraticall, or
Democraticall, etc. Although some also write, that in the church succeeding
the Apostles times, the Elders and Deacons were chosen to be perpetual: and
that speech of the Apostle, concerning the Deacons purchasing to themselves a
good degree, if they have used the office of a Deacon well, is duly to be
regarded thereabout. 1 Timothy 3, 13.

But having thus by the way noted these things: let us now furthermore
(touching the places aforesaid, and the matter in hand) observe herewithall,
how the speeches in those Epistles, are by the Apostle directed both unto
Timothee and Titus, in the singular number: (as is also by Christ to the Angels
of the several churches, Rev. 2 and 3 chap.) And whether this may not imply,
that in the churches where either of these came and were left by the Apostle,
or where there were not Pastors as yet, either they themselves (albeit
Evangelists otherwise) did now (for the time) supply the Pastors place and
office there: as James is observed to have done at Jerusalem, though he was an
Apostle otherwise. Act. 21, 18. or that what they did (for a time) in the
several Churches, where they came, being Evangelists: the same (in all things
ordinary and perpetual) should still be done by the Pastors, in their
particular and peculiar Churches, from time to time, until the appearing of
our Lord Jesus Christ. Whereabout that charge, so earnestly given to Timothee
in special, is well to be observed, being expressly given to endure, until the
appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: 1 Timothy 6, 13, 14. which could not (as I
noted here before) be done by Timothee in his own person (who dyed, after he
had served his own generation by the will of God) but was to be performed by
his successors, from time to time, unto the end of the world. As may also
appear by comparing 1 Timothy 6, 13, 14. with Rev. 2, 1, 8, 12, 18. and 3, 1, 7,
14. and Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20.

And more particularly, touching the church of Ephesus, where Timothee abode
some time (1 Timothy 1.3.) Eusebius gives record of Onesimus the Pastor of that
church: shevving how Ignatius, when he was at Smyrna, where Polycarpus was,
vvrote an Epistle to the church of Ephesus, making mention of Onesimus the
Pastor thereof. Eusebius. l. 3. c. 32. Besides the special mention of the Angel
of the church of Ephesus, like as of the church of Smyrna, and the other
churches particularly spoken of, Rev. 2.1.8.14.18. and 3.1.7.14. and that the
contents, both of Christ's letters directed to the Angels of the churches, and
of the Apostles to Timothee and Titus, are of such matters, as concern the
Pastors office, who by his name, gift, work, and duties of his calling, has
special charge of the flock over which he is set, in such things as Christ
and the Apostle have written off, in the Epistles aforesaid.

And for the churches in Crete, where Titus was left, Tit. 1.5. the like may
be minded, as of the other churches aforesaid: seeing they were so to be
established, as Paul had appointed Titus: and the Apostles ways were alike
toward all churches, as Paul himself witnesses. 1 Cor. 4.17. and 14.33. and
16, 1. Col. 4.16.17. and Tit. 1.5. with 1 Timothy 6.13.14.

5. There is a place likewise, in Heb. 13.7.17.24. showing that there were
diverse Elders in the churches of the Jews. Yet neither does this hinder, but
that they had also distinction of office among them, for teaching and ruling
Elders: as there the Apostle speaks of such, who spoke the word of God unto
them, and were their guydes and governors, watching for their souls, as they
that should give account, etc. where moreover the Apostle uses a word
(HEGOUMENOI,) signifying Guydes, Leaders, Captains, Rulers, Governors, chief,
etc. which is attributed to the Overseers and Governors both in church and
common wealth, yea even unto kings, and to Christ himself: Genesis 49, 10. 1 Samuel
25, 30. 2 Samuel 5, 2, 1 King. 14, 27. 2 King. 20, 5. 1 Chronicles. 26, 24. and 27, 4,
16. Psalm. 68, 27. Dan 3, 2. Mat, 2, 6. Luc. 22, 26. Acts 7, 10. who is here
also (in this chapter, Heb. 13, 20.) called the great Shepherd (or Pastor) of
the sheep: under whom the other Pastors and Guydes aforesaid* ministered, and
guyded the flocks committed unto them. And in Israel of old, they had among
the Jews, both Elders of the Priests, and Elders of the people: besides other
differences of the ministers and Governors among them: as was noted there
before. And in the church at Jerusalem (since Christ) there was James, together
with the Elders, overseeing the affairs of that church. Act. 21, 18, etc. And
Eusebius with other ancient Writers, notes the names of sundry Bishops (or
Pastors) who after James follovved, one another, in that church, for a long
time afterward: as is aforesaid.

6. Concerning the place, in 1 Pet. 5, 1 -- 4. the same things may be observed,
as about the other Scriptures before mentioned. And this moreover, that Peter
(an Apostle) does here call himself an Elder, and a fellow-Elder, with the
rest: ver. 1. So general is the word, and comprising in it Elders of diverse
sorts and offices: as even this place undeniably shows. Where may be noted
further, how Christ is here called the Archpastor, or chief Shepherd, ver. 4.
Which again plainly implies other Pastors and Bishops, that are inferior and
subordinate unto him, who is the chief and great shepherd of the sheep, and
Bishop of our souls. Heb. 13, 20. and 1 Pet. 2, 25. and 5, 1 -- 4. with Ioh.
21.15, 16.17. Act. 20, 17, 28. Romans 12.7.8. Ephe. 4.11, 12. 1 Timothy 5, 17. Rev.
2, 1, 8. and,. And hitherto of these things concerning these allegations out of
the Scripture.

Another allegation, about the matter aforesaid, is taken out of ancient
writers, Park. Polit. eccles. p. 236. etc.
showing that in some churches heretofore there were two Bishops (or Pastors)
in one and the same office, in one church at once. As namely, that there was
in the church of Jerusalem, at once, Narcissus and Alexander: and in the church
of Hippo, Valerius and Augustine; in Rome, Felix and Liberius; in Nazianzum,
Gregory the father, and Gregory the son, etc. Eusebius. l. 6. c. 7.9.10.
Sozomen. l. 4. c. 14. August. epist. 110. Gregor. Nazianz. epist. ad Gregor.
Nyssenum. Whereabout may be considered, I. Whether this was ordinary, or
extraordinary. If ordinary, how is it then that the same and other ancient
vvriters, do usually still make mention but of one, in one church, at one
time, as in their vvritings every where may be seen? If extraordinary and
upon some special occasions, what then was the ordinary course that was
otherwise kept and observed usually?

II. By the instances alleged, it appears that there were but two of these
Bishops, in these churches, at those times: Whereas by the Scriptures alleged,
and the general acknowledgement almost of all, there may be many Elders or
Bishops in a church, and far more then two. Yea if there were but one pastor,
one teacher, and one ruling Elder, in a church, there would yet be more Elders
or Bishops then two at once.

III. The two aforesaid also were both of them teaching Elders, and Ministers
of the word and Sacraments: whereas the Scriptures shevve, that there were
and should be in the Church, both teaching and ruling Elders.

IIII. The vvriters which mention these, note some special occasions thereof,
as that it was in case of old age, or sickness, or special good liking and
approbation of the parties, and returning to the churches and places from which
through troubles or otherwise they had some while ben absent, or other the
like: and some difference vvithall observed betvveene some of them. Which is
also duly to be regarded. For which, see the ^^ters and places aforesaid.

V. The time moreover is to be noted, when this was done. Which by the
instances alleged, appears to be some good while after the Apostles days:
Whereas the question is, concerning the primitive institution, and practice
from the beginning.

VI. Also, if such examples in later times, so recorded by these writers,
should be respected, why should not then the other examples of former times,
recorded by the same and other Writers likewise?

VII. And finally, the only sure ground of truth, and end of controversies in
Religion, is the word of God: vvherevvith so far as the ancient Writers
accord, their testimonies and vvritings may in their place well be regarded.
According to it therefore I leave these things, with the other before alleged
out of the Scriptures, to be considered and discussed. And hitherto of the
latter branch of this question.

Now furthermore, note withal, that how ever it be for the matter in hand,
touching the Pastors and other Elders of particular churches: yet still it
lies on them, who receive or plead for Diocesan and Provincial churches,
Pastors, or Bishops, that they show such churches and Pastors planted by the
Apostles at the beginning. For if it cannot be shevved, that the Apostles (by
virtue of their commission from Christ) established such Diocesan and
Provincial churches and Bishops, who then may establish or submit unto them? If
they who were the Master Builders under Christ, did not set them up, what
power then is there under heaven that may erect them? and what homage is it,
that a Christian soul can with good conscience yield unto them, in this behalf?

2. The churches must be such, and so established, as the Lord appoints and
approves in his word. Revel. 1, 12, 20. And every officer in the church must
(in a due regard) be counted a member in the body of Christ. Romans 12, 3 -- 8. 1
Cor. 12, 12 -- 28. Ephesians. 4, 4 -- 16. And none may set members in the body of
Christ, but the Lord himself. 1 Cor. 12, 18, 28. etc. Even as on the contrary
none may keep out, despise, or abandon those whom the Lord has appointed to
be in his church, and to continue therein, to the end of the world. Romans
12.6.7.8. Ephe. 4, 11, 12. with Esa. 66, 21. 1 Timothy 3.1 -- 15. and 5, 3, 9, 17.
with 6, 13, 14. and with Mat. 28.18.19.20. Luke 10.16. and 12, 42, 43. Ioh. 13,
20. 1 Pet. 5, 1 -- 4. Rev. 1, 16, 20. and 2, 1, 8, etc.

3. Moreover the functions and duties of such Prelates (if they be members of
the body of Christ) are to be showed out of the word of God: as we see done
for the Officers of particular churches. Romans 12, 6, 7, 8. Ephesians. 4.11.12.
with Esa. 66.21. 1 These. 5.12.13.24. 1 Timothy 5.17, Rev. 2.1.8. etc. and as was
in Israel, for the hy Priest, and for the other Priests and Levites: besides
that which was in their cities and Synagogues. Exodus 28. and 29. Lev. 1 -- 16
chap. etc. Number. 3, and 4, and 8. Deuteronomy. 16 -- 19 chap. Josh. 21 chap. 1 Chronicles.
23 -- 26 chapter Luke 4, 16 -- 20. Act. 13.14.15. etc.

4. The place also and manner, where and how such Bishops do and can meet
together with the rest of the body whereof they are members, that is, with
their Diocesan and Provincial churches, is to be showed in their practice, and
agreeable to the Scriptures: as may be done for the Pastors of particular
churches, and their assemblies, Rev. 1, 20. and 2 and 3 chapter with Acts
20.17.28. Romans 12.4 -- 8. Col. 4.16.17. 1 These. 5.12.13.14.27. Heb. 13.7.17.24.
Jam. 2.2. where the Apostle calls the assemblies of Christians, Synagogues:
which (as I noted before) may have reference to the Synagogues of the Jews.
Mat. 4, 23. Luke 4, 16 -- 20. Acts 13.5.14.15.42. and 14.1. and 17.1.2. and
18.4.7.8. etc. As also Jerusalem was the place, whither the Jews were bound to
come thrice a year, and where the high Priest and the other Priests and Levites
that ministered there, were bound to sacrifice, and perform the other duties of
their callings, for the whole church, from time to time, according as the Lord
particularly appointed in his word.

5. Yea the higher and greater that the members and functions are, which the
Lord has set in his church, the more undoubted it is, that they are specially
described in his word, and the more needful both for the church and the
Officers themselves, to have certain knowledge and assurance thereof. As was
for the chief Priests, and other officers of the church of Israel.

Necessary therefore it is, that the Diocesan and Provincial Churches (if any
such were planted by the Apostles) and the office, entrance, and
administration, of Diocesan and Provincial Bishops (which challenge to be
chief in the church, and distinct from the Pastors and Bishops of particular
churches) should be showed out of the Scriptures, by such as hold and would
uphold them, if they could.

The Catholic church of Rome (as they call it) and the universal Bishop
thereof, I omit: as being Antichristian most of all, and justly left by the
Protestants and Reformed churches. Though yet far more (in some respects) might
be pretended for this, from the state of Jerusalem and the High Priests, that
were for the universal church, then for the Diocesan or Provincial churches
and Bishops.

If any allege in this behalf (as some use to do) the examples of Timothee
abiding at Ephesus, and Titus left at Crete, by the appointment of the Apostle,
for the oversight and government of those churches, etc. and the subscriptions
also of those Epistles, wherein both of them are styled, the first Bishops of
those churches: let these things be observed thereabout: 1. That those
subscriptions are Apocryphal, and not part of the Scripture it self.

2. That some Greek copies, and the Syriack, and old Latin translation also,
have not this style or title at all.

3. That Timothee and Titus were Evangelists, who were sent and appointed by
the Apostles, sometimes to one place, sometimes to another, as they had
occasion. 2 Timothy 4.5.9. Tit. 1.5. and 3.12. whereas the Pastors and Bishops
were appointed to their peculiar flock and seat. Act. 20.17, 28. 1 Pet. 5.1 --
4. Rev. 1.20. and 2.1.8. etc. If either of these were so particularly employed
afterward, it helps not the matter.

4. The first Epistle of Timothee, has not this in the subscription. And in
the latter Epistle, where the subscription styleth Timothee, the first Bishop
of the church of the Ephesians, there does Paul in the same Epistle, both term
him an Evangelist, and exhort him to do the work of an Evangelist, 2 Timothy,
4.5. yea and call him from the church of Ephesus, (which was in Asia) to come
unto him to Rome, (which was in Italy) 2 Timothy 4, 9, 21. if the subscription be
right. Likewise in the Epistle to Titus, where the subscription styleth him,
the first Bishop of the church of the Cretians, there does Paul, in the same
Epistle, call him from Creta (in Greece) to Nicopolis (in Armenia.) Tit. 1, 5.
with 3, 12. And these things may be observed in those Epistles themselves,
where these subscriptions are: besides that other Scriptures do also shevve,
how they were sometimes in one part of the world, and sometimes in another,
sometimes in Asia, and sometimes in Europe, doing the duties of their office.
As that Timothee was in Asia, in diverse countries and parts thereof, in
Phrygia, Galatia, Mysia, Ionia, etc. And in Europe also, in Macedonia, Achaia,
Italy, etc. And in these countries and nations, sometimes in one city and
with one church, and sometimes with another, for diverse occasions and
purposes: as namely at Thessalonica, at Athens, at Corinth, at Ephesus, at
Rome, at Philippi, etc. For all which see these Scriptures, Acts 16 chapter and 17,
14, 15. and 18, 5. and 19, 22. and 20, 4. Romans 16, 21. 1 Cor. 4, 17. and 16,
10, 11. 2 Cor. 1, 19. Phil. 1, 1. and 2, 19, 22, 23. 1 These. 3, 1, 2, 6. with
both the Epistles to Timothee And that Titus likewise was sometimes in Europe,
at diverse places: as at Corinth in Achaia; at Rome in Italy; in Creta, and
Dalmatia in Greece, etc. And sometimes in Asia, as at Jerusalem in Judea, at
Nicopolis in Armenia, etc. As is evident by these Scriptures, 2 Cor. 8, 23, 24.
and 12, 18. Gal 2.1. 2 Timothy 4.10. Tit. 1, 4, 5. and 3.12, with the whole
Epistle to Titus. By which also appears, that Timothee and Titus, were
Evangelists, and so employed by the Apostle Paul, sundry times, and in sundry
places.

5. Besides, the church of Ephesus, was a particular, and not a Diocesan or
Provincial church: as may appear both by the places, where it is
particularly spoken off, Acts 20, 17 -- 28. Ephesians. 1.1. 1 Timothy 1.3. and 3.15.
Rev. 1, 11.12. and 2.1. and by the like estate of the other Churches of Asia,
written unto by Christ, Rev. 1.4.11.12.13.16.20. and 2.8.12.18. and 3.17.14.
compared with Col. 4.16. And so this touches not the point in hand. Creta in
deed is an Island, wherein were diverse cities: but in every of them were Elders
and Bishops ordained, as is here plainly expressed. Tit. 1, 5, 6, 7. etc. And
by this Scripture it seems, that when the Apostle departed from thence, all
things were not yet finished among them: vvhereupon he left Titus behind him,
to set in order the things that were wanting, and to ordeyne Elders and Bishops
in every city. Wherein what other thing did Titus, then what any other
Evangelist so left there might have done? Which also the Apostle himself might
and would have done, if he had remained there longer, and yet have been an
Apostle still, though for the time or by that occasion he had been so
particularly employed there? And when this was done there by Titus, Paul called
him from thence to come unto him to Nicopolis: as we have noted here before,
out of the same Epistle. Tit. 3, 12.

6. Moreover, the word Bishop or Overseer is sometimes used generally and very
largely: so as the office of an Apostle is sometimes so called, Acts 1, 20.

7. And lastly, why might not the Evangelists, being in an office superior to
the Pastors or Bishops of particular churches, have and supply their place in
any Church, where they came and remained: and yet this be no ground or warrant
of Diocesan or Provincial Bishops and churches: any more then James so being at
Jerusalem, who otherwise was an Apostle? Act. 21.18. Eusebius. l. 2. c. 23. and
l. 3. c. 11. and l. 7. c. 18.

For the further consideration whereof, besides that which has been said
before, I will here propound two things (in an other Reasons touching
communicating with the Minist. of the church of Engl. p. 26. etc.
treatise mentioned heretofore) which as they shall be found to have weight, may
give more light to these and other points sometimes called in question.

1. The first is this: Whether the Lords ordinance in his church be not such,
as the higher offices conteyne in them and comprehend the inferior offices: so
as they which be in the greater offices, have (besides their own peculiar
function, whereunto they ought to attend) power and authority both
themselves to perform the duties of the inferior offices, when there is
needful occasion; and to look that they be performed by all such as they are
specially laid upon, for the better service of the Lord and his church therein.
As may be observed, both by the estate of Israel heretofore, in the Priests,
and Levites, etc. and by diverse things written concerning the Apostles,
Evangelists, Pastors, and other Elders, in sundry cases. For example, that the
Apostles, who were in the greatest ecclesiastical office ordained by Christ
under the Gospel, had (besides the peculiar office of Apostleship) the power
also and authority of the offices of the Evangelists, Pastors, Teachers,
Elders, and Deacons, both to perform them upon just occasion themselves, and
to see them performed by others as is aforesaid. In like sort, that the
Evangelists (besides their own peculiar office and function) had in them the
power and authority of the inferior offices of Pastors, Teachers, and Elders,
etc. And likewise, that the Pastors (besides their own peculiar function) have
in them the power and authority of the Teachers and other ordinary offices,
for performance and oversight of them, as is aforesaid. Also, that the Elders
(besides their own special function) have in them the power and authority
of the Deacons office, for the doing and overseeing thereof, as was said
before, and so forth in the rest. For all which see, Acts 2, 40, 41, 42. and
4, 34, 35. and 6, 1 -- 6. and 8, 14, 25, 26, 35, 38. with 21, 8. and 11, 29,
30. and 14, 7, 23. and 15, 6, 22, 32, 35, 36, 40, 41. and 16, 4.40. and 20, 7,
11, 17, 28, 29, 30. and 21, 18 -- 25. with Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20. Ioh. 20, 21,
22, 23. and 21, 15, 16, 17. 1 Cor. 4, 15, 17, 22. and 5, 3. and 9.7.16.17. and
10.16. and 12.28. and 16, 3.4.10. 2 Cor. 1.19. and 8. 16.17.23. Ephesians. 4.11.12.
Phil. 1.1. and 4.3. 1 These. 3.2. and 5.12.13.14.27. Hebr. 13.7.17. 1 Pet. 5.1
-- 4. Rev. 2.1. etc.

2. The second is this: Whether on the contrary, the apostasy of Antichrist
be not such (as touching the ministry and government of the church) as
therein they which be in the lesser and inferior offices, have power and
authority, with them, to exceed the duties of the office which Christ has
appointed, and to perform the duties apperteyning to the higher offices: by
means whereof both Antichrist has risen up to so great a height, and so many
orders and degrees of superior and inferior ministers have been received, and
still are retained in that degenerate estate and apostasy of the man of sin,
as is come to pass. As namely, when the pastors and bishops of particular
congregations came to have power and authority over many churches and over the
Ministers and people therein: in a kind of resemblance of the extraordinary
offices (of the Apostles and Evangelists) already ceased: when now the
foundation was laid. Contrary to that which is written, Romans 17, 3 -- 8. Rev.
1, 11, 12.13, 16, 20. with 2, 1, 8, 12, 18. and 3, 1, 7, 14. Ephesians. 4, 11, 12,
13. Act. 20, 17, 28. Phil. 1, 1. and 4, 3. 1 Pet. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4. And that the
ruling Elders or Presbyters did the ministerial duties of the Pastors and
Teachers, in the particular Congregations. Contrary to 1 Timothy 5, 17. Ephesians 4,
11, 12. Romans 12, 7, 8. 1 Cor. 12, 28. And that the Deacons also baptize, and
became ministers of the word (in the office of Deaconship) which the Apostles
did expressly oppose to the duties of that office, at the institution thereof.
Act. 6.2.3.4. So as of these things and the like in that estate, it may be
said, as Christ did in another case, From the beginning it was not so. Mat.
19.8.

These things and the like may be noted about the points and questions
aforesaid. Which being not well observed in former ages, a way was made for
the Popes supremacy, by the steps of the Diocesan and Provincial Prelacy:
whiles each Pastor kept not his place, and within his bounds, under Christ the
Archpastor, nor the other Officers theirs, nor the Churches that order wherein
they were set by the Apostles at the beginning. Which being now in this
latter age observed and discovered, we should set our selves to reject and
witness against the Antichristian apostasy of the man of sin, and all the
aberrations and iniquity thereof: And be careful on the other hand, to
return to the ancient simplicity of the churches of Christ, as they were
planted in the beginning: alvvaies obserueing good order in all things, and
that way of government of the church, which is appointed by the word of God.

CHAPTER VII. Touching the Teachers office more particularly, and the Ministers
of the word in general.
Whether there be not two sorts of Teachers or Prophets (which the Lord has
given for the work of the ministry) or at least a two fold duty, and diverse
function or ministration thereof. One of such as are peculiarly appointed to
the teaching of particular churches: Of who^ see here before, in the fifth
Question page, 259. The other of such, as do either 1 Samuel 19, 20. 2 King. 2,
3, 5 7, 15. and 4, 1. and 6, 1. and 9, 1. with Amos 7, 14. Luc. 2, 46. and Act.
5, 34. with 22.3.
in the Schools and universities interpret the Scriptures, and train up the
students in Theology; or do Deuteronomy. 33, 8, 10. Nehem. 8, 1 -- 8. 2 Chronicles. 17,
7, 8, 9. Prove. 1, 20, 21. and 8, 1, 2, 3. and 29, 18. Esa. 30, 10, 20, 21. and
57, 19. and 59, 21. Ier. 18, 18. Hos. 5, 9. and 7, 12. Amos 2, 12. and 7, 12,
13. Mic. 3, 11. Ezech. 22, 25, 28. and 13, and 14 chap. Jer. 14.13. Mat. 5, 1,
2. and 9, 37, 38. and 13, 1, 2, 52. and 22, 35. and 23, 34. Luke 5, 17. Act.
13, 1, 15. and 15, 35. Rev. 11, 3. and 18, 24. with Act. 11, 19 -- 24. Romans
10, 14, 15, 17. 1 Cor. 12, 28, 29. and Ephesians. 4, 11, 12.
othervvhere privately and publikly, in houses, streets, ships, armies,
garrisons, or other assemblies, any where, instruct the people in Religion, and
al duties of godliness, common or special, as there is just occasion.

Also, whether these Teachers should minister the Lords supper, is vvithal to
be considered and examined by the Scriptures: Seeing the Levites in Israel
were not suffered to come to the Altar or holy things of God, no nor to flay
the sacrifices, unless in a special case, when there were not Priests enough.
Number. 18, 3. and 3, 10. and Levit. 1, 6. with 2 Chronicles. 29, 34. Which is the
more to be noted, because the Levites were by the ordinance of God, joined to
the Priests, in the Ministry of the Lords house, and for teaching Israel the
Law of God, etc. who yet notwithstanding might not do all things perteyning
to the Priests office, Numb. 18, 2, 3. and Ezech. 44, 13, 14, 15, 16. with Number.
3, 5 -- 10. etc. and 16 chap. By which also appears, that some Ministers may
be employed in some works of the Ministry: who yet notwithstanding may not
lavvfully do all things that perteine to the holy ministration, and to some
other Offices appointed thereunto. And that the Pastors and Teachers now are
answerable to the Priests and Levites in Israel, was noted before out of
Esa. 66, 21. compared with Ephesians. 4, 11, 12.

As touching the election or calling of these Teachers: I spoke here before of
the calling of those which are of the former sort, as touching their choice to
particular congregations: as may be seen in the third Question, page 252, etc.
Now touching the calling of the Teachers of the latter sort, whether they be
such as are Professors in Universities, or others that are not tied to any
particular churches, I leave it to be considered and discussed by the word of
God, whether such be not sometimes raised up of God extraordinarily; or having
an ordinary calling may (upon special occasion) be sent out by Princes (as of
old was done by Iehoshaphat king of Judah;) or be called and allowed to teach
by the Universities and Governors thereof, or designed by particular churches;
or approved by the Pastors and Presbyteries of one or more churches; or by some
other good and lawful means be admitted and appointed, to the performance of
the duties aforesaid, according to the rules and examples had in the word of
God. 1 King. 19, 16. Amos 7, 14, 15. Mat. 9, 36, 37, 38. and 21, 23, 25, 34,
36. Luke 1.17. 2 Chronicles. 17.7.8.9. Sal. Song 8.1.2. or 8.9. Acts 8.4.14.26 and
11.19.22. and 13.1.2.3. 1 Timothy 4.14. with 2 Timothy 1.6. and 2.2. Revel.
11.3.4.10. and 18.24.

Some write M. Brou. on Rev. 11. p. 108. 109
that among the Jews, such as were taken to be Doctors (or Teachers) for to
teach the people, were first held to be very learned: and that then some of the
Sanedrin laid their hands upon such a one, and said, Rabbi, take thou
authority to teach, what is bound, and what is loose. Maymon. in Sanedrin.
And then might Christ well have reference thereunto, Mat. 16, 19. and John 20,
23. Which point I thought good here to note down, and to leave it to further
observation: As also, whether some like course may not or should not still be
used, for the orderly calling of Teachers and ministers, to the office and work
of the ministry, in the time of the Gospel.

And finally, what may be intended by those words of the Prophet, where Esaias
prophesying of the time of the Gospel, and calling of the Gentiles, brings
in the Lord speaking thus, And I will also take of them (of the Gentiles) for
Priests and for Levites, says the Lord. etc. Esa. 66.21, 22. Where all the
words are well to be observed, when he says, And also; I will take says the
Lord, of the Gentiles; for Priests and for Levites. etc. For in deed the Lord
himself took the Priests and Levites (out of the tribes of Israel) to be the
ministers of the Sanctuary, and to minister therein still on, age after age,
one after another, until the time of correction at Christ's coming. Exodus 28
and 29. Lev. 8. and 9. Numb. 8. Deuteronomy. 10.8. and 33.8 -- 11. 1 Chronicles. 15, 2, 3,
-- 24. 2 Chronicles. 29.4 -- 11. with Heb. 9.6 -- 10. etc. (Whereas the ruling
Elders and Governors were then at first appointed to be chosen by the people.
Deuteronomy. 1.9.13. and 16.18.) And what also by the Apostles speech, when speaking
likewise of the ministerial offices of the Gospel, he says, that Christ
ascending up on high, gave gifts unto men: And that he gave some, Apostles; and
some, Prophets; and some, Evangelists: and some Pastors, and Teachers; for the
perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of
the body of Christ: till we all come into the unity of the faith, and of the
knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the
stature of the fulness of Christ. Ephesians. 4.11.12.13. (Where likewise there is no
mention of the ruling Elders, as not being appointed for the work of the
ministry, and being also before plainly enough and sufficiently designed in
the Elders of the church of Israel. But the speech here, is only of the
ministers of the Gospel:) where again all the words are to be observed, both
touching the giver (Christ himself) ver. 1, and 11. and the several offices of
ministry given, ver. 11. and the use, ver. 12. with the durance and
continuance of them. ver. 13. For although the offices of the Apostles,
Prophets, and Euagelists, be not now in any particular men's persons, as they
were then: yet the fruit of them abides still, and is perpetual, in their
writings and labors, in the foundation laid once for all, and in the plantation
of the churches, according to the ordinance of Christ. Mat. 28.18.19.20. John
15.16. 1 Cor. 3.10.11. and 4.9.10. Ephesians. 2, 20. and 3, 5, 6, 7. and 4, 8 -- 13.
1 Timothy 3, 1 -- 15. and 6, 13, 14. 2 Timothy 2, 2. Rev. 21, 14, 19, 20. And the
offices of Pastors and Teachers (answerable to the Priests and Levites in
Israel, Esa. 66, 21. Ier. 33, 18 -- 22.) are still to endure in the church,
for the work of the ministry, age after age, to the end of the world. And
whether therefore the Lord has not still preserved his ministry, though
corrupted (as he has also done his seal of Baptism) through the corruptest
times: and that ordinarily such a calling should alvvay be had thereunto of al
Pastors and Teachers, as we may be assured, it is derived from Christ himself,
by the Apostles, Evangelists, and other ministers of Christ, from the
beginning, unto this day: and shall likewise still be continued until the
appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. Ephesians. 4, 11, 12, 13. compared with Esa.
66, 21, 22. and 59, 21. Jer. 33, 18 -- 22. and with Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20. Act.
14, 23. and 20, 17, 28. 1 Timothy 3, 1 -- 15. and 5, 22. and 6, 13, 14. 2 Timothy 2,
2. Tit. 1, 5. Heb. 12, 28. 1 Pet. 5, 1-4. Rev, 1, 4 -- 11 -- 19, 20. and 2, 1,
8. etc. and 7 -- 16 chapter and 10, 7 -- 11. and 11, 10, 11, 12. and 14, 6 -- 18.
and 18, 24. and 21 and 22 chap.

CHAPTER VIII. Touching the exercise of Prophecy.
Whether in the churches (where there are men endued with fit gifts) there
should not be had the exercise of Prophecy, for interpreting of the Scriptures,
disputing of points of religion, propounding of objections, answering of
questions fitly and needfully made, and such other good uses profitable for the
church, and the edification thereof in the truth, which is according to
godliness. And this exercise also to be done, not only by the Ministers of the
word, Specially, such as employ themselves in the study of the Scriptures.
but by others also having gifts, that are fit and able thereunto. Yet alvvaies
so, as al things be done decently and in order. Romans 12.6. and 1 These. 5, 20.
compared with 1 Cor. 12, 7. and 14 chap. Luke. 2, 46, 47. with Ioh. 7, 14, 15.
1 Pet. 4, 10, 11. 2 Timothy 2, 2, 15, 16, 23. with Act. 15, 1, 2, 6, 7 -- 22.32.
and 17, 2, 3. and 18, 4, 26. and 19, 8, 9, 10. Mat. 13, 52. Also 1 Samuel 10, 5,
10, 12. and 19, 20, 21, 23. 2 King. 2, 3, 5, 7. and 4, 38. and 5, 22. and 6, 1.
Amos 7, 14. with 1 Cor. 14, 1 -- 40.

1. Because this order and exercise was in Israel, and in the primitive
churches. Luke 2, 46, 47. Act. 17, 1, 2, 3. and 18, 1, 4, 24, 26. and 19, 1, 8,
9, 10. with Romans 12, 6. 1 Cor. 12, 7. and 14 chapter 1 These. 5, 19, 20. 1 Timothy 1,
3, 4. and 2 Timothy 2, 16, 23. Tit. 3, 9. 1 Pet. 4, 10, 11.

2. The Apostles do often in their Epistles require of the churches the
careful using hereof. As when Paul says to the Romans. Having then gifts,
differing according to the grace that is given us, whether Prophecy, let us
prophecy according to the proportion of faith: Or ministry, let us be in our
ministration, etc. Romans 12.6.7.8. Where the Apostle teaching the diverse use of
men's gifts, shows that they may be used either out of office, in prophecy,
so as we prophecy according to proportion of faith; or in office and
ministry, either in teaching, or in exhorting, distributing, ruling, and
showing mercy. Likewise in the Epistle to the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 14 chap.
where though the Apostle speak of extraordinary gifts, as he does also before,
in 1 Cor. 13.2. yet notvvithstanding from thence by due proportion and
consequence, may the use also of ordinary gifts well be gathered: and many
things in that chapter lead thereunto. As when the Apostle says: Follow after
love, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophecy. He that
prophecyeth, speaks unto men, to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.
etc. 1 Cor. 14.1.3. etc. And in the Epistle to the Thessalonians: Quench not
the spirit: despise not prophesyings: Prove all things: hold that which is
good. 1 These. 5.19.20.21. The Apostle Peter also in his Epistle says: As every
man has received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good
stevvards of the manifold grace of God. If any speak, in him speak as the
oracles of God: if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which
God gives, that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ: to
when be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 1 Pet. 4, 10, 11.

3. Else the diversities of gifts in men, are not known, nor used, as they
might be: and other men's gifts are quenched, save the ministers only; or at
least they are not so used for the profit of others, as well they might. Which
is against the use and end, for which they are given: which is, for to profit
withal: as the Apostle teaches. 1 Cor. 12.4.7. and to find out and hold that
which is good. 1 These. 5, 19, 20, 21. For which cause also the Apostle required
both of Timothee and Titus, to repress such as should teach corrupt doctrine,
and to restrain foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and
strivings about the Law, and whatsoever tended not to edifying, but was
unprofitable and vain. 1 Timothy 1, 3 -- 7. and 6, 20. 2 Timothy 2, 16, 23. Tit.
3.9. Which should always carefully be looked unto, by the Ministers and
Overseers of the church.

CHAPTER IX. Touching the ministration of the Sacraments to all persons
generally.
Whether the Sacraments should be ministered to such as stand obstinate in
known iniquity, until they repent: either Mat. 3, 5, 6, 7, 8. and 28, 18, 19,
20. Luke 7, 29, 30. Act. 2, 37, 38, 39. Genesis 17, 1, 7, 9, 12, 23. Romans 4, 11. 1
Cor 7, 14. Ezra 6, 21, 22. Jer. 9, 26. Ezech. 16, 59 -- 63. and 32, 29. and 44,
6, 7, 8, 9. Hos. 2, 1, 2, 4, 16, 17. Hag. 2, 14, 15. Mal. 1, 7, 12. and 2.17.
Rev. 14.9 -- 12. and 17, 1, 2. and 18.4. etc.
Baptism, or the Mat. 26.26.27.28.29. Acts 2.41.42.46. 1 Cor. 10.16.17.18. and
11.20 -- 34. and 12.12.13. compared with Exodus 12.15.43 -- 48. and 20.7. Lev.
7.20.21. and 13.45.46. and 22.25. and 24.5.6.7. Numb. 5, 2, 3. and 9, 7, 14.
and 19, 22. 2 Chro. 29, and 30, and 34, and 35 chapter with 1 Cor. 5, 6 -- 13. 2
Cor. 6, 14 -- 18.
Lords Supper.

1. Seeing they are the seals of Gods everlasting covenant of grace made with
the faithful and their seed, and pledges of the righteousness and salvation
which is by faith in Jesus Christ. For which, see the Scriptures here before
alleged.

2. Our Sacraments are answerable to theirs in Israel. And neither the
strangers uncircumcised might eat of the Passover; nor the Israelites in
apostasy, til they repented; nor the unclean, til they were cleansed. Exodus
12, 43, 45, 48. Lev. 7, 20, 21. and 22, 25. 2 Chronicles. 29. and 30, 5. etc. and
34, and 35. with 1 Cor. 5, 6, 7. 2 Cor. 6, 14 -- 18.

3. Else the Table of the Lord and his holy things should not be regarded, as
they ought to be. Mal. 1, 7, 12. 1 Cor. 10, 16, 21. and 5, 6 -- 13. Lev. 22,
25. and 24, 6, 7.

4. And the giving of the seals of Gods grace and righteousness, to the known
open wicked, being still unrepentant, might thus far forth become a justifying
of them, and promising life unto them in their estate, and an hardening of
their hearts and strengthening of their hands the more in their evil ways:
besides the defiling of our selves and the holy things of God, that might also
come thereby. Prove. 17, 15. and 24, 24. Esa. 5, 23. Ezec. 13, 22. Mal. 2, 17.
Hag 2, 14, 15. Numb. 5, 2, 3. and 19, 22. Deuteronomy. 24, 8, 9. Josh. 7, 1, 2 -- 13.
and 22, 20. 1 Cor. 5, 6 -- 13. 2 Cor. 6, 14 -- 18.

5. As touching the children, that are baptized by the church, they are thus
all members thereof, and ought accordingly to be esteemed, and (what in us is)
should be brought up, as an holy seed, in the awe and information of the Lord.
Genesis 17, 1, 7, 9, 12, 23. with chap. 18, 18, 19. 1 Cor. 7, 14. and 12, 12, 13.
Psalm. 22, 30, 31. Prove. 22, 6. and 30, 1, 26, 28. Matthew. 28, 18, 19, 20. Mar.
10, 13 -- 16. Ephesians. 6, 4. 2 Ioh. ver. 4.

If it be said here, that all Israel was circumcised, even the Apostate
Israelites of the ten tribes: I grant both that it was so: and that they did
well in that they retained circumcision, as they did also 1 Kin. 21 3. 2 King.
7, 3. Hos. 2 11. Amo^ 8, 5, 10.
other of the ordinances prescribed by God: yet notwithstanding they sinned
greatly vvithall, in that they adulterated those ordinances of God, and
corrupted themselves with Idolatries and superstitions, etc. Such as now also
is the estate of the church of Rome and other the like apostate churches, who
do well in reteyning of Baptism and other ordinances of the Lord, which
they do notwithstanding otherwise very sinfully corrupt and adulterate, etc.
Of which see here before in the first Treatise, chapter 3. p. 27. etc.

Here also let us search, whether it was lawful for the tribe of Judah and
such of the Jews as walked faithfully with God, to circumcise the children of
the apostate Israelites or the like, and then to leave them to their idolatrous
parents to be brought up: when their parents would not communicate in the
Passover, and leave their idolatry, etc. Hos. 11.12. And hereabout see the
histories of Hezekiah and Josiah Kings of Judah, who first purged the Temple,
and removed public Idolatry, and then afterward celebrated the Passover. 2 Chronicles. 29. and 30. and 34. and 36 chapter 2 King. 23 chapter And consider herewithall
the law touching the Proselytes, Exo. 12, ^8, etc.

But on the other hand also (for the better finding out of the truth) let us
observe, whether the children of those that were unclean in Israel, Lepers or
others, were not to be circumcised the eight day, notwithstanding the parents
uncleannes, as well as other children among them. Genesis 17, 12, 14. Lev. 12, 2,
3. Joh. 7, 22, 23. with 2 King 5, 27. 2 Chronicles. 26, 21. Lev. 13, 3. and 15, 2.
Numb. 5, 2, 3, 4. and 19, 11. Deuteronomy. 24, 8, 9. And whether the fact of Christ
receiving and blessing the little children, which were brought unto him that he
might put his hands upon them, and pray: will not also warrant us to receive
and baptize the little children of Christians, that are brought unto us, to be
baptized, and to be prayed for, or blessed: Specially considering that Christ
was displeased at his disciples, who would have hindered it, and said unto
them: Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such
is the kingdom of God. Where that special reason alleged by Christ, and
ground whereupon he did it, is in like sort well to be observed. Mat. 19, 13,
14, 15. Mar. 10, 13 -- 16. Luke 18, 15, 16. Of which also, upon other
occasion, I have spoken here before, in the first Treatise, chap. 1. page 22,
23.

CHAPTER X. Touching the manner of the administration of the Sacraments: Also,
touching the Cross in Baptism, and kneeling at the Lords Supper, etc.
Whether the Sacraments ought not to be administered and received, according to
the simplicity of the Gospel, without any vain inventions of men, or corrupt
abuses thereabout. Exodus 20, 4, 5, 6. with Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20. and 1 Cor. 11,
23 -- 26. 2 Cor. 11, 3. Lev. 10, 1. Esa. 1, 12. Heb. 12, 25, 26 -- 29. Gal. 3,
15. Col. 2, 23. 2 Timothy 3, 16, 17. Rev. 22, 18, 19.

1. Because else there is transgression of the commandment and ordinance of
God. Exodus 20, 4, 5, 6. with Mat. 28, 19, 20. and 1 Cor. 11, 23, 24, 25.

2. And the Lord is thereby provoked to wrath, and stirred up to punish such
transgression. Exodus 20, 5. with 1 Cor. 11, 20, 30. Lev. 10, 1, 2, 3. 1 Chr.
13, 9, 10. Psalm. 119, 21, 101, 113.128. Ezech. 23, 41 -- 49. and 43, 7, 8. Mal.
2, 1 -- 9.

3. The people of God are bound, in the administration of the Sacraments,
asvvell as in other duties of the service of God, to worship (...) only
according as himself has prescribed in his word: Lincol. Ministers Abrid.
excep. 2. arg. 2.

Survey of the Book of common prayer, Qu. 99. p. 97. 98.


and therefore to renounce and forsake al superstition and idolatrous
inventions of men in Gods worship: al humane ceremonies of mystical
signification: al parts and parcels of the Beasts mark whatsoever; and
carefully to keep the commandments of God, and faith of Jesus Christ. Exo.
20, 4, 5, 6. with Rev. 14, 9 -- 12. and 18, 4. and 22, 18, 19. 2 Cor. 6, 17.
Ephesians. 5, 11. Esa. 30, 22. Psalm. 119, 101, 113, 128. Mat. 15, 7, 8, 9.

4. Thus shall we also follovv the example of the godly and faithful servants
of God, that have been before us. 1 Cor. 4, 1, 2. and 11, 1, 2, 23. Gal. 1. 10,
11, 12. Number. 9, 1 -- 5. Exodus 39, 43. with Heb. 3.1.2. Ioh. 12.49.50. Luke
1.5.6. 8.9. 1 Timothy 6.13.14. 2 Pet. 1.16. etc.

5. Else it should argue the Scriptures to be insufficient for directing the
church in the use and ministration of the holy things of God. Contrary to 2 Timothy 3.16.17. 1 Cor. 4.1.2. 1 Timothy 3.15. and 6.3.13.14. with Exodus 20.4.5.6.

6. Finally, what end else would there be in the Church, of men's precepts, new
administrations, strange worship, voluntary religion, Antichristian
apostasy, etc. Esa 29.13. Mat. 15.9. Col. 2.8.18.22.23. 2 These. 2.3.4. with
Number. 15, 38, 39, 40. Deuteronomy. 4, 2. and 12.32.

Hereby then may appear, how corrupt the use is of the sign of the cross in
baptism; of kneeling and uncovering the head at the Lords supper, in the act
of receiving; of reading prayers out of a book, at the ministration of the
Sacraments, and the like things; which the Scripture prescribes not, but men
have taken up of themselves; thus breaking the second commandment, and joining
their posts and thresholds with the Lords. Exodus 20, 4, 5, 6. with Lev. 10.1.
Deu. 12, 32. Psalm. 119.128. 2 King. 16.10.11 -- 16. Ezech. 43, 7, 8. Mar. 7, 3
-- 9. Col. 2.18.22.23.

Besides that thus men are drawn from the simplicity and synceritie of the
practice, used by Christ and his Apostles, who sat when they eat and drank,
and did not then uncover their heads any more then before; neither made a
cross when they baptized, nor read their prayers out of books, etc. Mat. 26,
20. etc. and 28, 18.19.20. with 1 Cor. 10, 16, 17, 18. and 11, 23. etc. And
finally, that these are part of the relics and monuments yet remaining, of
the apostasy of Antichrist the man of sin. Which therefore ought to be
refused and witnessed against by word and deed. 2 These. 2, 3, 4. Whereof I need
not write more particularly, but only leave the Reader to apply the former
reasons and the like, to these and other such corruptions yet retained among
them.

Concerning which, they that would see more, may read the treatises that have been heretofore purposely written hereabout: Namely, M. Parkers Scholasticall
discourse against Symbolizing with Antichrist in ceremonies: especially in the
sign of the cross. Where (in ten several chapters) he treats of the breach
of all the Ten commandments thereby. Also, A little treatise touching kneeling
at the Lords Supper, in the act of receiving. Moreover, The Trial of
subscription: And, The Lincoln Ministers Abridgment of the reasons why they
refuse Subscription and Conformity. The Survey of the Book of common prayer.
And M. Greenvvoods and other treatises of book-prayer. About which also, see
here before, chap. 1. page 245. etc.

CHAPTER XI. Of the disposing, blessing, breaking, distributing of the bread
and wine.
Whether we should not (at the celebration of the Lords Supper) set the bread
and cup upon a Table, and so with thanksgiving first bless the bread, and then
break it in the sight of the church, and so distribute it being broken: and
then after the distribution thereof to all the communicants, to take the cup
also, and to bless and distribute it in like sort. 1 Cor. 10.16.21. and 11.20
-- 34. Mat. 26, 26, 27. with Lev. 24.5 -- 9. Ezech. 44.15.16.

1. Because at the first celebration and institution of the Lords Supper this
order was observed: as we may see, Mat. 26.26.27. Mark. 14, 22, 23. Luke
22.19, 20. with Mat. 28, 20. And the same manner also kept by the Apostles
afterward: as may be gathered, by that which is written, 1 Cor. 10, 16, 21.
and 11.23 -- 26.

2. The breaking of the bread, does not only serve for the distribution
thereof, but is also a lively representation of the death of Christ, which we
show forth in the participation thereof. 1 Cor. 10, 16, 17. and 11, 24, 26.
with Mat. 26, 26. Mar. 14, 22. Luke 22, 19.

3. Such placing of the bread and wine upon a Table, and the distribution of
them there accordingly made, we may also learn by the very term of a Table,
and the common use thereof. Paul calls it a Table, not an altar, form, or
deske: and opposes it to the Idolaters Table, on which they were wont to set
their meat and drink. 1 Cor. 10, 21. with ver. 19, 20, 28. Hitherto also may be
referred the use of the Table in the Tabernacle, on which the Show bread
continually was set before the Lord. Exodus 25, 23 -- 30. Lev, 24, 5 -- 9.

4. And for the thanksgiving to be made both at the blessing of the bread, and
the wine, it is plainly expressed. Mat. 26, 26, 27. and Mar. 14, 22, 23.

CHAPT. XII. Touching the Ministers communicating with the rest of the Church.
Whether the Minister himself (that administreth the Lords supper) should not
also partake with the church, communicating together therein. Mat. 26, 17 --
29. Act. 20, 7 -- 11. 1 Cor. 10, 16, 17. and 11, 23 -- 26. and 12, 12, 13. with
2 Chronicles. 35, 3 -- 14.

1. Because Christ himself did so, communicating with his disciples both in
the Passover, and in the Supper follovving. Mat. 26, 17 -- 29. with Luke 22,
15, etc.

2. So also did the Priests and Levites at the celebration of the Passover,
whereunto the Lords supper with us is answerable. 2 Chronicles. 35, 3 -- 14. with 1
Cor. 5, 7. and 10, 16. and 11, 23 -- 26. And the Fathers of families, at the
first celebration of the Passover, Exodus 12, 3. etc. And the Apostles at the
celebration of the Lords supper, Act. 20, 7 -- 11. 1 Cor. 10, 16, 17.

3. And Christ our Lord has thus commanded, saying, Drink ye all of this,
Mat. 26, 27. And again, Do this in remembrance of me. 1 Cor. 11, 24, 25.

4. The nature also of the thing it self, and the reasons which are annexed to
the commandment of Christ, concerning the celebration of the Lords supper,
comprehend and bynd the Minister himself, asvvell as the other members of the
church, to the participation thereof. As namely, that it is a sign and seal
of the remission of sins obtained for us by the death of Jesus Christ. Mat.
26, 26, 27, 28. And, that thus we should show forth the Lords death, till he
come. 1 Cor. 11, 23 -- 26. And, that it is called the Eucharist, or
thankesgiving, because we do now give thanks unto God for our redemption
wrought by the death of Jesus Christ, and thus confirmed unto us through his
grace. Luke 22, 19. 1 Cor. 10, 16. and 11, 24. with Psalm. 116, 12, 13, 14. etc.

5. And the minister himself is together with the rest a member of the church
and body of Christ: the communion whereof is here also celebrated. Romans 12, 3
-- 8. compared with 1 Cor. 10, 16, 17. and 12, 12, 13, 18, 27, 28. Otherwise
also we had need take heed, that there be not in deed a schism or rent made in
that Church, (and so in the body of Christ) where this order is not observed.
Like as came to pass in that other case, where of the Apostle vvriteth to the
church of Corinth, 1 Cor. 11.18. etc.

CHAPT. XIII. Touching the Ruling Elders, Deacons, or common people, ministering
the Sacraments.
Whether it be right and lawful for the Ruling Elders, Deacons, or private
people out of office, not being Ministers of the word, to administer the
Sacraments: or at the Lords supper in the delivery of the bread and wine, to
bless them; and to say to each of the communicants severally, Take thou, and
eat, etc. or, Take thou, and drink, etc. Matthew 26, 26, 27. with 1 Cor 4, 1. and
10, 16. Ephesians. 4, 11, 12. Esa. 66, 21. Ier. 33.18.21. Ezech. 43, 18 -- 27. and
44.19. and 46.20. 2 Coron. 13.10.11. and 35.2 -- 15. with 1 King. 12, 31. 1 Chronicles. 15.2. Romans 12.3 -- 8. 1 Cor. 12.4 -- 28. Heb. 5.4.5.

1. Seeing that the Ministers of Christ, are the household stevvards and
dispensers of the mysteries of God, the ambassadors of Christ, and laborers
together with him. 1 Cor. 4, 1. with 3, 5, 9. and 2 Cor. 5, 20. Luke 12.42.
Rev. 2.1. with Mal. 2, 7. Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20.

2. At the first celebration of the Lords supper, Christ himself (the Apostle
and high Priest of our profession) did minister it: and giving thanks blessed
the bread and wine, and distributed them both, among his disciples, saying to
them all together at once, Take ye, eat ye, drink ye, etc. Hebr. 3, 1. with
Mat. 26, 26.27. Mar. 14, 22, 23. Luke 22, 19, 20. 1 Cor. 11.23. etc.

3. And the ministration of the Sacraments, and blessing of the bread and wine,
is a work of the ministry. Mat. 28.18.19.20. and 1 Cor. 10, 16. with Ephesians.
4, 11, 12. Act. 20, 7. etc.

4. The How the other Prisbyters or Elders that are Ministers o^^ spoken of in
ancient writers) may administer the sacraments, and as some think, Baptism
more specially: here I treat not: But wish that the right may be sought out,
and rightly observed.
ruling Elders of the Christian church (of whom I speak) are such as are
answerable to those Elders in the church of Israel, which were called As being
chosen out of the people, by the people, and for the people. etc.
The Elders of the people, or the Rulers of the Synagogues, etc. and were
distinct from the other ministers, Priests, and Levites, which ministered the
word and holy things of God in Israel. 1 Timothy 5, 17. and Romans 12.7.8. with
Jer. 19.1. Act. 13.15. and 18.8.17. and Deuteronomy. 33.8.10. Esa. 66.21. 2 Chronicles.
13.10.11. Whereupon Ambrose says Ambr. in 1. Tim. 5.
Both the (Jewish) Synagogue, and afterward the church (of the Christians) had
Elders, without whose counsel nothing was done in the church. The which by
what negligence it is out of use, I know not, unless it be by the sloth, or
rather pride of the Teachers, whiles they alone will seem to be somevvhat.
But now these Elders being (by the mercy of God) recovered again, and had in
many of the reformed churches, it is for them carefully to attend upon their
own office and function; assisting the Pastors and ministers of Christ in the
ministration and government of the church, and procuring (what in them is) the
good order, peace, and benefit of the whole church, and of all the members
thereof: but still leaving to the Pastors and other ministers, the works of the
ministry perteyning unto them: that so all may perform and fulfill their
own offices and ministeries, according to the rule of the word of God. 1 Timothy
5.17. with Act. 20, 17, 28. Rev. 2.1. etc. Romans 12.7.8. 1 Cor. 12.28. Ephesians.
4, 11, 12. Col 4.17. 1 These. 5.12 13 14. Heb. 13.7.17. Iam. 5.14. 1 Pet. 5.1 --
4.

5. The Lords supper also is answerable to the Passover and sacrifices:
which (after the building of the Tabernacle) were offered by the Priests, and
not by the Elders of the people. 1 Cor. 5.7.8. with 2 Chronicles. 13.10, 11. and
35.2 -- 15. also Ier. 19.1. and Esa. 66.21.23. But note, that here I speak not
of the praeparation and other service, which is attributed to the Levites;
concerning which, see 2 Chronicles. 35.2 -- 15. That may well have an other
consideration, which in a good manner may be referred to the work of the
Deacons, who now make ready and prepare al things necessary for the Lords
Supper, and after the blessing or consecration made by the Pastor, do in some
churches receive the bread and wine of him, and deliver it unto the
communicants, that all things in the church may be done decently and in order.
Whereabout also observe that which is written, Act. 6, 2, 3. with 1 Cor.
14.40. and 2 Chronicles. 35, 2 -- 15. and what by good consequence and proportion
may be gathered and inferred thereupon.

6. And touching the Deacons office it self, note also how it is distinct from
the office of the ministers of the word: so as the Apostles thought it not to
be meet or reason, that they should attend to the duties thereof, together
with their ministry: but that others should be appointed to that function:
and that they would give themselves continually to prayer, and to the
ministry of the word. Act. 6.2.4. And thus also the offices of the Ministers,
Deacons, and Elders, are reckned as distinct, by the Apostle Paul, Romans 12.7.8.

7. Moreover, the Lord has joined the administration of the Sacraments with
the ministry of the word. Mat. 28.18.19.20. Act. 20.7.11. 1 Cor. 3.5.9. with
10.16. Now what God has viz. In the same persons, and things, and in the
ordinary administration, etc.
joined together, let not man put asunder: as Christ taught in another case.
Mar. 10.9. And on the contrary, what God has set asunder, let not man join
together. Numb. 16.9.10. and 18.1 -- 7. with Esa. 66.21. Ezech. 44.19. and
46.20. 1 Timothy 5.17.

8. Here also may be considered, how God was sore displeased at Corah, though
he were a Levite; and at Dathan and Abiram, with their company, though they
were Princes of the assembly, famous in the Congregation, and men of
renown; also at Vzziah, though he were a King; when they would have offered
incense upon the altar before the Lord: which God had laid upon the Priests.
Numb. 16 chapter 2 Chronicles. 26, 16. etc.

9. Finally, a man can receive or take nothing unto himself, except it be given
him from heaven. Ioh. 3, 27. and 1, 25, 33. And no man takes this honor unto
himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. Heb. 5, 4, 5.

Accordingly do the old and new Writers teach, about the ministration of the
Sacraments and other holy things of God in the church, that difference should
still be kept, betvveen the Ministers and the people. Their testimonies I need
not note in particular: they are so well known. Only see more specially
Polanus on Ezech. 43, 18 -- 27. page 785. 787. And Piscator also, and Iunius:
who write, that to consecrate the people to minister unto God, whereunto God
appointed the Levites only, were against the right worship of God, and a
perverting of all order. Piscat. Schol. in Ezech. 44, 19. Juniij Annotat. in
Ezech. 46, 20.

CHAPTER XIIII. Touching the often celebrating of the Lords supper: And of the
time of the day, whether in the morning or evening, etc.
Whether it be not best and most agreeable to the will of God, to celebrate
the Lords supper often, and (where it can well be) every Lords day: besides
the churches continual serving and worshipping of God daily. 1 Cor. 11, 23 --
26. and 10, 16, 17, 18. compared with Act. 20, 7. and Esa. 66, 23. with Exodus
20.8 -- 13. Rev. 1, 10. Ezech. 44, 15, 16, 24. and 45, 17 -- 25. and 46 chap.
Numb. 28, 9, 10. Act. 2, 42.46. and 3, 1. and 26, 7. 1 These. 5, 17, 18.

1. Because the Apostle teaches, that Christ at the first celebration thereof,
said, This do ye, as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me: And thereupon
infers, As often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show the
Lords death till he come. 1 Cor. 11, 25, 26. Which plainly implies the often
observation thereof, in remembrance of Christ, and his death.

2. Thus also the Apostles and Churches at first used to do: as may appear by
the Apostles words aforesaid, 1 Cor. 11, 26. and by that which is written,
Act. 20, 6, 7. Where it is said, that Paul abiding at Troas seven days, upon
the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread,
Paul preached unto them, etc. Where it appears, that their coming together
to break bread (that is, to celebrate the Lords supper) was on the first day of
the week, that is, on the Lords day. Which likewise is expressly noted by Who
lived about 150 years after Christ.
Iustine Martyr, in his second Apology: where he says, On Sunday, as it is
called, there is a coming together in one place of all that dwell either in the
tovvne^ or in the country. And there is read the commentaries of the Apostles
and Writings of the Prophets, as time will suffer. Then the Reader ceasing, Ho
proestos.
the Praesident makes a speech, wherein he instructs the people, and
exhorts them to the imitation of such excellent things. Afterward we rise
up all together, and power out prayers: and (as I said before) bread and
wine and Even by this time, corruptions began to creep in: as by this and
other particulars here and otherwhere may appear.
water is brought: and the President likewise povvreth out prayers and
thanksgiving with all the might he can: and the people heartily speak out
together, saying, Amen. And then to every one that is present is there made
distribution and communication of those things that were blessed, on which
thanks were given before: and to those that are absent some is sent by the
Deacons. etc. Just. Martyr. Apolog. 2. Edit. Commel. Graeco-lat. page 76.77. A
remainder of which practice, for celebration of the Lords supper every Lords
day, as also of the daily worship of God (and of some other like things good
to be observed) may be seen in the Cathedral churches at this day: though with
corruptions otherwise.

3. The nature end and use of the Lords supper may likewise lead hereunto:
inasmuch as it is the sacrament of our continual nourishment and comfort in
the church by Jesus Christ: as baptism is of our once entering thereinto: And
is also the memorial of the death of Christ, which he suffered for our sins:
and should therefore still be remembered, and often celebrated of us with
thankesgiving. According as Christ himself has taught, saying: Do this in
remembrance of me: and again, This do ye, as often as ye drink it, in
remembrance of me. 1 Cor. 11, 24, 25. By which means our faith is the more
strengthened, our hope increased, our mutual love nourished, and we still
stirred up, with all thankfulness to ascribe unto God the praise of our
salvation in Jesus Christ. In which respect also it may fitly be called the
Eucharist or Thankesgiving. 1 Cor. 10.16 -- 18. and 11.23 -- 26. compared with
Mat. 26.26.27.28. Mar. 14.22 -- 25. Luke 22.19.20. Act. 2.41.42. and 20.7.
with Numb. 28.9.10. Ezech. 44.15.16.

4. And note here, how the Papists and Lutherans do much urge, (though
diversely) the having of Images, for the better remembrance of Christ, and to be
in stead of books for the unlearned people, etc. whereas Christ has appointed
himself to be described, and his people to be taught and put in remembrance of
him, not by Images, but by his Gospel and Sacraments: Mar. 16.15. Gal. 3.1.8.
Mat. 26.28. and 28.18.19.20. 1 Cor. 10.16. and 11.23 -- 26. And therewithal
let it be observed, whether that Images were not then most of all brought into
the churches and private houses, under the pretenses aforesaid, when the
diligent teaching of the Gospel, and often celebration of the Lords Supper,
did by degrees decay and cease more and more in the parishionall churches among
the people. So as the Ministers becoming themselves dumb, non resident, or
slothful, the Images (though also dumb) were made to supply their place,
being now set up to be the peoples teachers and remembrancers another way, in
stead of the lively preaching of the word, and careful observation of the
Lords supper; for the continual shevving forth and memorial of his death from
time to time. Which therefore may the more stir up the churches (now being
reformed) not only to abandon the foresaid Images, but also diligently to use
both the preaching of the Gospel, and often communicating at the Lords Table,
the better to meet with the corruptions of later times, and to return to the
intier practice of the churches that were in former ages.

5. Furthermore, the Lords supper (being rightly considered) is answerable not
only to the Passover, but to the other Feasts also and sacrifices had at
Jerusalem: And the Prophets speaking of the times of the Gospel, (under the
terms of the shadows of the Law) foretold that from one New moon to
another, and from one Sabbath to another, all flesh should come to worship
before the Lord, at Jerusalem, etc. Which by the practice aforesaid carefully
observed, we may perform and enjoy in Christ, who is the truth and body of
all those types and shadows. And how otherwise it is or can outwardly be
performed aright, and ansvverably to the prophecies and shadows aforesaid,
should by all churches heedfully be observed. Esa. 66.23. Ezec. 44.15.16.24. and
45, 18 -- 25. and 46, 1 -- 11. Zach. 14, 16 -- 19. with Col. 2.16.17. Act.
2.42. and 20, 7. Rev. 1, 10. 1 Cor. 10.16 -- 18. and 11.23 -- 26. Besides that
the Lords day, and the Lords supper at the Lords Table, do fitly agree
together both for the terms, and for the things themselves, thus spoken of
Rev. 1.10. compared with 1 Cor. 10.16.17.21. and 11.20. and Act. 20.7.

Another question there is, about the time of the day, when the Lords supper
should be celebrated, whether in the morning or evening, etc. Some think, it
should be in the evening or after noone, because Christ at first with his
disciples did eat it at even, after the Passover, vvhereupon it was called
the Lords supper. Touching which, on the other hand, may these reasons be
observed, and the like.

1. That the having of it then at even, was upon special occasion; because it
follovved the celebration of the Passover, which was kept at even. Which
occasion ceasing, the time is left free: Christ having not appointed it, or any
set time thereunto. Mat. 26.17 -- 26. etc.

2. So Christ and his disciples eat it then with unleavened bread by the
occasion aforesaid; and the feast of unleavened bread, then also observed.
Which now being ceased, as we are not therefore bound to the use of unleavened
bread, so neither are we bound to that circumstance of time, but may as freely
use another time, as other common and usual bread therein. Mat. 26, 17 -- 26.
Mar. 14, 12 -- 22. with Exodus 12.8.15.18. etc Act. 2.42. and 20.7. 1 Cor. 10,
16.

3. In like manner, at the first celebration of the Passover in Egypt, they
eat it standing with staves in their hand, as ready to depart from thence: and
sprinkled blood upon the lintell and side posts of their doors, keeping
within, and not going out of their houses, because that night the Lord would
pass through, to smite the Egyptians, and seeing the blood on their door
posts, would pass over them, and not destroy their first borne with the
other. Exodus 12.7.11 -- 13.22.13. Which occasions ceasing, when afterward
they were in the land at rest, they eat it sitting, and sprinkled not their
door posts with blood, neither were bound to keep within, but might go
out of their houses: as we read that Christ with his disciples sat down to
eat it, and then afterward went out of the house that night to the mount of
Olives, etc. Mat. 26, 19.20.30.

This shows forth the Lords death already done: as those typed out his death
then to come.
4. Moreover, the Lords supper (as by other occasion I noted here before) is so
to be considered, as not only succeeding the Passover, but as answering also
to the other Feasts and Sacrifices then had in Israel. Which were observed
as well in the morning, as at evening. Not to speak of the Show bread, still
being on the pure Table, before the Lord: and other the like ordinances had in
Israel. Which in the perpetual equity thereof, may have their use: being
hereunto fitly and vvisely applied, according to the proportion of faith. Ioh.
1, 29, 36. 1 Cor. 5, 7. and 10, 16, 17, 18. Luke 22, 7 -- 20. compared with
Lev. 1 -- 7. and 23 chap. and 24, 5 -- 9. Numb. 15, 1, 2 -- 29. and 28 and 29
chap. Deuteronomy. 16, 1 -- 17. Heb. 13, 8 -- 16. Hos. 14.2. Mal. 1, 11. Zach. 14, 16
-- 19. Esa. 66, 23. Rev. 13, 8.

5. Finally, the ancient practice of the churches of Christ, ever since the
Apostles times, confirms the same yet more unto us. As, when in the Acts of
the Apostles it is written, that upon the first day of the week, the disciples
came together to break bread. Act. 20, 7. Where, in that he says, they came
together that day to this end, we must either think that they met but at
evening for it, or grant that they had and might have it at other times
besides: Which Iustine Martyr makes manifest, whose words I noted here before,
besides the continual practice of the Church ever since throughout all ages:
which is carefully to be regarded, in all such things as are not repugnant or
disagreeing to the word of God.

CHAPTER XV. Touching the having of a Fast, and the Lords supper, both
together, in one day.
Whether it be meet and right, upon one and the same day, to have a solemn
Fast, together with the celebration of the Lords supper. Judge. 20, 26. Ester.
4, 16. compared with Mat. 26, 26 -- 29. Act. 20, 7 -- 11. 1 Cor. 10, 16, 17,
and 11, 23 -- 26.

1. Because the nature of them both (to wit, of a Fast, and of the Lords
Supper) is so very diverse and differing the one from the other. Which may
appear by their names, besides the nature of the things themselves. The one is
a Fast, the other a Feast. In the one we absteyne from meat and drink: In the
other we do eat and drink. Which also Christ himself has commanded, saying,
Take ye, eat ye, drink ye, etc. And the one is a sign or solemn
testification of sorrow, the other of joy. Judge. 20, 26. Ester. 4, 16. with
Mat. 26.26 -- 29. Luke 22.17 -- 20. 1 Cor. 5, 6, 7, 8. Where also see and
consider that which is written, Neh. 8, 10 -- 13.

2. The Lords supper succeeds the Passover, and is answerable unto it. At
the celebration whereof the Lord required, that they should eat and drink in
Israel. And not that they should fast, as in the day of Atonement, wherein they
were enjoined to afflict their souls, and from even to even to celebrate their
rest. Luc. 22, 7 -- 20. 1 Cor. 5, 7. and 10, 16, 17. and 11, 23 -- 26. and
Exodus 12, 3 -- 11. Deuteronomy. 16, 1 -- 7. 2 Chronicles. 30, and 35 chap. and Psalm. 116,
13. compared with Lev. 23, 5, 6, 27 -- 32. and with Judge. 20, 26. and Dan. 10,
2, 3, 22. And here note, that the Lords supper was celebrated of Christ
together with his disciples, straightvvay after their eating of the Passover.
Which is a point likewise to be observed in this behalf. Matthew. 26, 17 -- 30.
Mar. 14, 12 -- 26. Luke 22, 7 -- 20. As also, that it is now in the Church the
Christians feast, answerable (in some respects) to the sundry feasts observed
among the Jews. Act. 2, 42. and 20, 7. 1 Cor. 5, 7, 8. and 10, 16, 17, 18.
and 11, 23 -- 26. with Mar. 14, 22 -- 26.

3. And all things in the church of God should be done decently and in order. 1
Cor. 14, 40. Now what order, or decency is there in this, that whiles and where
a Feast is solemnly observed, there should bread and wine in the same assembly
be set upon a public Table, and all at the same time be enjoined, to take, to
eat, and to drink, etc. or that solemn Fasts and Feasts should be celebrated
and joined togethef, upon one and the same day?

4. Here moreover may be observed, how they were wont in the primitive
churches to have loue-feasts, with the Lords supper: as by some Scriptures,
and other vvriters may appear. 1 Cor. 11, 20 -- 34. and Jude epist. ver. 12.
Tertullian. Apolog. cap 39. Which then being so, may show how far this custom
and practice differs from that which was used in the churches of old. Not to
speak, how some in former times have made question, whether the church might
have any Fasts upon the Lords day at all. Into which point I will not now
enter: neither insist upon things, that in extraordinary cases may be admitted.

CHAPT. XVI. Touching Loue-feasts.
Whether it be good and lawful, for the churches now, to have and use
Loue-feasts, at times convenient, and namely, on such days, when they have
the Lords supper. Jude, epist. ver. 12. 1 Cor. 11, 20 -- 34. compared with
Deuteronomy. 12, 5, 6, 7. and 16, 1 -- 15. Touching which, on the one hand, observe
these things following.

1. That so they practiced in the primitive Churches: as may appear both by
some speeches in the Scripture, Jude, ver. 12. 1 Cor. 11, 20 -- 34. and by the
record of ancient writers, Clement, Tertullian, etc.

2. And note in Tertullian, how he shows, that they were kept in his time,
which was about two hundred years after Christ. And so long then they had
continued from the Apostles times there, where Tertullian lived. Tertullian.
Apolog. cap. 39.

3. Now whence this practice first arose, I leave further to be considered.
Only for the point in hand, this I note, that whether they did it for the
better nourishing and continuing of love and peace among themselves; or for the
more comforting and refreshing of the poor by the richer sort, and together
with them; or that they had therein respect to the action of Christ, who
celebrated the Lords supper after the eating of the Passover ( Luke 22.7 --
20.) or that they took this custom (as they did many other things) from the
Jews, who were wont to have feasts together with their sacrifices
(specially with their thanks offerings) and at their solemn festivities; or
that they had it from some other like original; it comes to a like end, as
touching the matter spoken off. Deuteronomy. 12, 7. and 16, 1 -- 15. 1 Samuel 1, 4. with
Exodus 32, 6. Psalm. 116, 12, 13, 14, with 66, 13, 14, 15.

On the other hand may be considered, how it is observed and noted Paraeus in 1
Cor. 11.22. Piscator in 1 Cor. 11.34 etc.
by diverse, that the Apostle took them away, and would not suffer the use of
them in the church of Corinth, because of abuses that were among them, through
faction, schism, and superfluity. 1 Cor. 11, 17 -- 34. Which being compared
with the other particulars here before mentioned, may show that it is a thing
indifferent, either to keep them, or to leave them, as they shall be used or
abused, and as every church shall find to be most expedient for them and their
estate: whereas if it were a moral and perpetual ordinance of God, the abuse
only should be corrected, and the thing it self still continued, and all
churches continually bound to the observation thereof. As we see done in the
same place, about the Lords supper it self. 1 Cor. 11.20, 23. etc.

CHAPT. XVII. Touching the observation of set Holy days, besides the Lords
day. And namely, of Easter, and Christmas, etc.
Whether it be lavvful for the church of Christ, now in the time of the
Gospel, to consecrate other set days, and ordinarily to keep them as holy
days, besides the Lords day. And, Whether it be lawful to consecrate some
certain days yearly, to the Nativitie, Resurrection, and ascension of Christ;
to the Virgin Marie; to the Apostles; and all Saints. Gal. 4, 9, 10, 11. Col.
2, 16, 17. 1 King. 12, 32, 33. Jer. 3, 16, 17. and Exo. 20, 8, 9, 10. with Act.
20, 7. 1 Cor. 16, 1, 2. Rev. 1, 10.

1. Seeing that Christ himself by his practice, and the Apostles both by their
practice and vvritings, have commended unto us only the Lords day, which is
the first day of the week: wherein Christ our Lord rose again from the dead,
bringing life and immortality to light, and everlasting righteousness into the
world, as being by him renewed for ever. In memorial whereof we are not
enjoined to set apart yearly other days, besides the Lords day, but (as I
noted before upon other occasion) that we should often celebrate the Lords
supper, in remembrance of him, so shevving forth his death, until he come, to
make us partakers of eternal salvation in his kingdom for evermore. John 20,
1, 19, 26. Rev. 1, 10. Act. 20, 7. 1 Cor. 16, 1, 2. with 10, 16. and 1^, 23 --
26. Dan. 9, 24, 27. Esa. 66, 22, 23. Exo. 20, 8, 9, 10.

2. Now also the observation of days and times that was under the Law a shadow
of good things to come, is accomplished in Christ. And the ceremonial
difference of days is taken away together with the rest of the Jewish
shadows and ceremonies: all times being sanctified in Christ to the name and
worship of God, so as we have not now such need or use of yearly rites and
observations, as was heretofore under the Law, before Christ's exhibiting in
the flesh. Col. 2, 16, 17. Gal. 4, 10, 11. with Esa 66, 23. Jer. 3, 16, 17.

3. And seeing we may not now thus use the days which were once ordained by
God himself, much less may we thus use other that are devised by men, and
imposed on the church. Gal. 4, 9, 10, 11. with 1 Kin. 12, 32, 33.

4. Besides that by such observation of days, as is aforesaid, superstition
and other corruptions still are nourished, and the Papists and others more
confirmed in their errors.

5. Here also may be observed, that festival or holy days are appurtenances
of the Idols or Images (whether Christian or Heathen) to which they were
first appointed: and thus far forth apperteyne to the second commandment, and
are breaches thereof. In which respect likewise, it is not lavvful to invent,
or to observe any such as are devised by men, for the service and worship of
God. And therefore, as the reformed churches have abolished and taken away the
Images of the Saints, Apostles, Virgin Mary, the Rood, Crucifix, and the like:
so should they likewise abandon their festival or holy days, with all other
remnants of superstition perteyning thereunto. Exo. 20, 4, 5, 6. with 32, 4, 5.
1 Kin. 12, 33. Esa, 30, 22,

6. And whereas some, that have rejected the other Saints days, do yet
reteyne the observation of Christmas, Easter, and the like, in tegard of the
Nativitie, and Resurrection of Christ, etc. apply hereunto both the reasons
aforesaid, and these also follovving more particularly.

Touching Easter, or the Resurrection of Christ.
1. Whereas the observation thereof, from the Apostles times, is much alleged:
note, 1. That it coming at the same time when the Passover was wont to be
kept in Israel, it might the more be borne with, as some other rites, days,
and ceremonies of the Jews were for a time. Act. 15, 19, 20, 21, 24 -- 29.
Romans 14, 1, 5. etc. and 15, 1, 2, etc.

2. The great and ancient controversy, that was about the time of the
observation thereof, betvveen the East and West Churches, may well show that
they had no institution or certainty thereof. For if there had been an Apostolik
constitution thereof, what needed there have been such a strife and contention
thereabout?

3. We have vveekely the Lords day, wherein Christ rose again from the dead.
And what need or use then is there of one day yearly to be kept thereabout:
when as weekly we have the Lords day, on which Christ rose from the dead; and
appeared to his disciples that day, and eight days after again (passing over
the Jews Sabbath;) and gave to John the Revelation on that day, etc. and all
his actions are our instructions. Of which, see more here before, section 1.
Concerning which also Iustine Martyr vvriteth thus: On Sunday we have all
generally our meeting together: inasmuch as it is the first day, wherein God
turning the darkness and matter (which he created at first) made the world: and
Jesus Christ our Savior that self same day rose from the dead. For the day
before Saturday he was crucified: and the day after, which is Sunday,
appearing to his Apostles and disciples, he taught those things which we relate
unto you, that ye might look into them. etc. Justin. Martyr. Apolog. 2. Ed^.
Commelin. page 77.

Touching Christmas, or the Nativity of Christ.
1. That the time thereof is not certainly known, or is much mistake^: there
being many reasons of weight, why it should rather be thought to be in
September, then in December, as now commonly is held and observed. 1. The
heaven and earth, and so the world, was at first created in September (at
which month, the Jews to this day begin their civil year) whereunto fitly
is answering the creating of the new heavens and earth, brought in by Christ,
and foretold by the Prophets. Esa. 65, 17, 18. and 66.22. Rev 21, 1.

2. The month of September was in Israel by Gods ordinance, most what a
month of feasts. Number. 29 cha. with Lev. 23, 23, 24, 27, 34. etc. Which might
fitly type out the gladsome birth and coming of Christ at that season into the
world; Whereof the Angel said to the Shepherds, Fear not: for behold, I
bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you
is borne this day, in the city of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.
Luke 2, 10, 11.

3. More particularly, in the month of September was the Feast of boothes or
Tabernacles, solemnly observed in Israel. Levit. 23, 34 -- 43. and Numb. 29,
12 -- 38. Neh. 7, 73. and 8 chap, Which also might fitly lead unto the birth of
Christ at that season: of whom the Gospel says (speaking of his manifestation
in the flesh) The word was made flesh, and dwelt as in a booth or Tabernacle
among us, etc. John 1, 14. For so does the word Ioh. 1, 14 with 7, 2. Mat. 17,
4 Act. 15, 16. Heb. 9. chapter and 11, 9 2 Cor. 5, 1, 4. 2 Pet. 1 13, 14. Rev 21.3.
ESCENOSE there used signify, and implies thus much. Which may well have
special reference hereunto.

4. Also in the same month was the Ark by Solomon brought into the Temple, to
the most holy place, at the Feast of Tabernacles. 1 King. 8. 1 -- 6. etc. Now
both the Temple, and most holy place, and the Ark it self, were special types
of Christ in diverse respects. John. 2, 18 -- 21. Hebr. 9, 24. Romans 3, 25. Rev.
11, 19.

Touching which point, concerning this month and matter, because M. Broughton
In his book called, Our Lords Family, etc. fol. 2. b. and 3. etc.
has observed diverse things of good use and moment, I will here therefore set
down his observation in his own words, as follows:

In what month S. Mark begins his story: and the rest the opening of the
heavens by the second Elias.
Because our Lord was baptized, even beginning thirty, and to open the
Kingdom, by teaching the covenant to many, three years and six months: Seeing
his souls passage from the cross to the Father is certain in the fifteenth
of Nisan; So his birth and baptism should be in the seventh month, Aethanim.
Which was the first month, after the creation of the world.

Of the month Ethanim or September.
It may somewhat help to mark the old story of Aethanim from 1 King. 8, 2. Al
Israel assembled to the King Solomon, in the month Aethanim, in the feast,
that is the seventh month: And the Sacrificers brought the Ark of the covenant
of the Eternal, unto his place; unto the Debir; unto the holy of holyes; and
the Cherubims spread their vvings over the place of the Ark. This so solemn
should have antitypon answerable in high matter. And what thing else can be, but
that the most Holy was manifest in his Temple; and the army of Angels spread
their wings; to have him honored at his coming then into the World.

The explication and story, of the month Aethanim
The most learned Chaldee Paraphrast Jonathan speaks thus, of Aethanim. It is
the month of the ancient, and they called it the first month, of festivity.
But now it is the seventh month. Thus David Kimchi does expound him: Aethanim
or Strength is the month wherein they gathered the fruits and increase of the
earth, to their houses. For that cause it is called the feast of gathering
fruits: So Aethanim means strength: and fruits and increase of the earth be
the life of a man. And some of our Doctors expound Aethanim, the month in
which the Fathers were borne: the stay (Aethanim) of the world; as the speech,
Mich. 6, 2. Hear ye mountains, and ye strong foundations of the earth. Others
call it Aethanim, from the strength of the Laws that are given for this
month, both feasts, and laws, So Ralbag says, I think it called the month
Aethanim, for the feasts: the strong, and teaching justice: which are in this
month. Thus far Ralbag. The first day had the Trumpets; the tenth, Expiation;
the fifteenth, the feast of Tabernacles, for eight days. And Jonathans words
cited of me before, be thus expounded of Cimchi: Before the time, that Israel
came from Egypt, Tisri or Aethanim was the first month. For in Tisri, the
world was made. And by reason that the Children of Israel came from Egypt in
Nisan, it became the head of months, and Tisri became the seventh. For so the
blessed God said unto them: This month shall be unto you the first of months.
To you, by reason that to the rest of the world it is not first: For Tisri is
the first. And thus much for the month.

So John Baptist well might begin the first day, and assemble unto him much
people fourteen days: and our Lord come to him the fifteenth day, when they
had learned of the stronger then the Baptist, who would baptize with the holy
Ghost and with fire. So the four Evangelists celebrating the Baptism,
celebrate the birth, which was the same day 29 full years. So as the first
Adam, and the other to Noah, came into the World that month, Christ should
come: And that time was fittest for Caesar to bid men resort to their cities:
And most likely that shepherds would yet be abroad with their sheep: And
fittest for men to go into a river naked to be baptized. And by Daniels half
seven, John brought in Baptism; for Heathen; as David and Solomon only
baptized Proselytes. Maimony in Asure Bia, tract. 12, and 13. And if his
vvarrant had not ben sure and plain, from Daniell, none might have come to him
for Baptism.

So our Lord beginning a new year of his age then, shevved the same time of
the month to have given us his coming into the World. And the Rabbines in
Midras Rabba conclude that Messiah shall be borne in Aethanim or Tifri; full of
feasts, to teach of him. And God appointed no feasts for the Winter: because of
the unseasonablenes of the Weather. Chrysostom mistaking John's Fathers story,
thinking that he ministered not in June but in September, began to disgrace the
state of the Gospel. Hence Turk and Jevv scoff, that we place the birth,
where the conception should be; and can yield no reason of our Gospels
narrations, which we make most unlikely to be true. And Anas Montanus helps
Chrysostom, that Zachary should be high Sacrificer: Whereas all Jews know,
that the Candlestick, Table, and Altar of incense were without, and daily
gone to by the ordinary sacrificers. Elias, four times made the beginning of
Daniels half seven, might have taught the Jews a sure note, what Elias,
Malachie spoke off. Now the end of all the Evangelists is in the first month,
toward leaving the Egypt of this World at the Pascha. And at Pentecost
after, the Law was given to Moses, when the fiery law of the spirit was by
Jesus given.

So the conception of John, where men placed his birth, falls to Midsommer;
and birth to the spring Aequinoctiall: and likewise the conception of Mary fell
most fitly to Mid-winter; and our Lords coming into the world, to the
September.
first month after the creation; and his Redemption, to the March.
first month for redemption from Egypt. These matters agree with Scripture,
and plain reason, etc. Thus far M. Broughton; whose observations about this
matter, I thought here to insert, because they are of great weight, and give
great light to the point in hand.

5. Hither also may be referred, that Christ, after he was baptized, was four
Passeovers at Jerusalem: and that Luke 3, 21, 23.
being baptized at that season of the year when he was borne: the things which
he did betvveene his baptism and the first Passover, were so many and of
such sort, as might well take up all the time betvveene September and the
Passover in March follovving: As namely, his being in the wilderness where he
was tempted, forty days. Mark 1, 9 -- 13. His abiding some while about the
place where John baptized, Ioh. 1, 28, 29, 35, 43. His departing into Galilee:
and going both to Cana of Galilee, where he was at a marriage, Joh. 2, 1 -- 11.
and to Nazareth, where (as his custom was) he went into the Synagogue, and
preached on the Sabbath day. Luke 4, 16. and from thence to Capernaum, where
he dwelled, and taught likewise on the Sabbath days. Mat. 4, 12, 13. Mar. 1,
14, 21. Luke 4, 31. Joh. 2, 12. His journey also from thence to Jerusalem, to
the Passover (the first Passover, after he was baptized) which is spoken
off, John 2, 13. besides that he did many things, which are not all
particularly recorded. Ioh. 21, 25. Thus then might well so much time be spent,
as was between September and March, wherein the first Passover following his
Baptism was celebrated.

6. Especially, here is to be observed, the half seven, of three years and an
half (spoken off by Daniell) wherein Christ preached, after he was baptized.
Whereunto fitly answers the space of time between September and March,
containing half a year or six months: whereas if the reckoning be made from
the end of December (where the nativity of Christ is now commonly placed) unto
the Passover in March following, there will be but only three months, and not
six months or the half year, before spoken off. Dan. 9.27. Whereunto also (as
touching the time) that phrase of speech may have reference, which is used
concerning the woman in the Revelation, of a time, and times, and half a time.
Rev. 12.14.

7. Finally, as the Lords supper now among Christians, answers to all the
Sacrifices which they had in Israel heretofore: so also the Lords day now is
to us in stead of all their Feasts and holy days of Sabbaths, New moons,
Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. So as now we have no cause or need of
such yearly days and Feasts, as then they had; Christ being come, who is the
body of all those shadows, whereof the Feasts were a part. Col. 2, 16, 17.
compared with Esa. 66, 23. Act. 20, 7. Rev. 1, 10, 11, etc. Of which, see
more here before, Chap. 14. sect. 2, and 5, etc.

On the other hand, there is alleged the ordinance concerning the Feast of Or,
Lots.
Purim, enacted by Mardochee and Ester, and accepted by the Jews for them and
their generations after them, in memory of their deliverance from the
tretcherie of Haman, etc. Ester 9, 20 -- 32. Touching which, these things may
be observed: 1. that the book of Ester (wherein this is recorded) is Canonical
Scripture: and whether it were written by Ezra, or by Mardochee himself, or by
some Prophet that lived in those times; as the book it self, so also the Feast
there spoken off, has the approbation of the Spirit of God, by which that
history was written. And who can say otherwise, but that the Feast aforesaid
was in deed ordained and agreed upon by special instinct and direction of the
spirit of God?

2. That Feast might also be a civil ordinance and solemnity, kept in
memorial of the deliverance aforesaid. And so much might both the manner of
enacting it, and the name and use of it likewise import; it being established
accounted and observed, as a time of feasting and joy, and a good day, and of
sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor. Esther 9, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23 -- 29 -- 32.

3. And how ever it were observed, whether as an ordinance civil, or
ecclesiastical, or both: yet this is evident, that this was done in the time
before Christ, when as now they had the observances of the law, whereof their
Feasts were a part by the ordinance of God: from the bondage whereof we are
now freed by Christ, and are taught by the Apostle to stand fast in the liberty
vvherevvith Christ has made us free, and not to be entangled again with the
yoke of bondage. Concerning which, the Apostle reproving the Christians says,
Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years: I am afraid of you, least
I have bestowed upon you labor in vain. Gal. 4, 10, 11. and 5, 1. etc.

Which last reason may be observed in like sort, about the Feast of the
Dedication, spoken off, John 10, 22, 23. (at which time John says, Christ
walked in the Temple, in Salomons porch, and reasoned with the Jews) which
was a Feast ordained by Judas Machabeus and the Congregation of Israel, in
remembrance of the dedication of the Altar, spoken off, 1 Match. 4, 59.
Whereunto likewise may be applied the former reason, touching the Feasts and
shadows then used, which typed out our spiritual joy in Christ, who is the
truth and body of all those shadows and observations. Col. 2, 16, 17.

And whereas some, for defense of Holy days invented by men allege the
voluntary sacrifices had in Israel: let these things further be observed
thereabout: 1. That those sacrifices in Israel were to be such only as God
had prescribed, and so to be observed, as the Lord had appointed. 2. That no
Prince or persons might forbid or take them away without sin. Which I suppose
will not be said touching the aforesaid observation of Holy days. 3. That
they were not urged upon Churches or persons against their will, as the Holy
days prescribed by men now be. 4. That this or that man might bring them upon
special occasion, when the whole Church was not bound thereunto: whereas
the observation aforesaid is laid as a duty upon whole Churches, and not left
voluntary to this or that man, to do or leave undone, as they see cause. 5.
That many who observe and plead for them, do sometimes acknowledge them to be
humane ordinances, vvishing they were taken away, and keep them against their
will. And how then can they be accounted as the voluntary sacrifices which
the Lord prescribed, and Israel observed of old? 6. Finally, if this plea
were good and sufficient in such cases, what inventions of men are there in
religion, that some would not thus plead for, that they are as the voluntary
sacrifices had in Israel: and so open a vvide door to all will worship, and
in deed take away the second commandment, or securely transgress it under
such colors and pretenses?

CHAPTER XVIII. Of dealing with sinners, for their reclayming, or censuring.
Where also is treated of Suspension, and excommunication, etc.
Whether the ordinance of God, for the reclayming and gayning of brethren that
fall into sin, should not still be observed carefully and religiously, among
the members of the church. And that as there is occasion, they be brought to
the assembly of the Governors, or the Congregation, in public (having all
things carried in order, and according to the rules of government, prescribed
by the Lord:) that so the cause being heard, a due examination of the parties
and vvitnesses being made, and the fault certainly found out and convinced, the
parties offending may (according to the nature of the sin) be admonished;
secluded, suspended, or debarred for a time from the Lords supper, and other
meetings of the church, or use of the holy things of God therein; yea even cut
off from the church, and delivered to Satan, if the case so require. Such of
the brethren (I say) as do sin and offend, whether it be that they reproach
abuse or injury others by word or deed, and despise the private admonitions of
their brethren and of the vvitnesses, that deal with them; or that they offend
publicly; or do otherwise transgress in their conversation; or that in
religion they fall into heresy, idolatry, or other impiety and iniquity; and
so persist, after all good means religiously used for their reclayming. This
being still carefully regarded, as is aforesaid, that the order appointed by
God in his word, be observed; that the Elders and Governors perform all such
things, as perteyne to their office and duty of their calling; and that the
other members of the church do keep themselves every one in their place,
with all modesty, reverence, peace, and godlynes, beseeming the church and
people of God. Lev. 19, 17. Prove. 25, 8, 9, 10. Luke 17, 3, 4. and Matthew.

1. Because this is a moral and perpetual ordinance and direction, given by
the Lord, in his word, both to the church of Israel heretofore, and to the
Christian churches and people of God for ever. As may be seen in the
Scriptures here noted before. Neither does it hinder, that in Israel, there
were some judicial and ceremonial things, which were temporary, in some
cases also mixed and prescribed vvithall. For the same also may be said and
observed, about other the precepts of the Law and of the Ten Commandments:
which all acknowledge to be moral and perpetual. Besides that the spiritual
application, and perpetual equity of the ceremonies and ordinances that are
abolished, does still remain and continue, for the instruction, use, comfort,
and direction of the church, for ever. And this in matters of all sorts,
whether perteyning to the faith, worship, ministry, order or government of
the church, etc. As may be seen in these and the like Scriptures: Genesis 17, 11,
12, 13. compared with Col. 2.11.12. and Romans 4, 11. Exo. 12.3 -- 17. with Luke
22, 1 -- 20. and with 1 Cor. 5, 2 -- 6.7 8.11. and 10.16.17.18. and 11.23 --

2. And that this order was observed in Israel and in the primitive churches,
in cases of sin, controversy, complaint, censure and excommunication,
(besides the extraordinary occasions that fell out or were carried after any
extraordinary manner:) may appear by the Scriptures before mentioned: with
which, these also here follovving may be compared. Numb. 12.4 -- 15. and 27.1

and 16, 4. and 20, 17 -- 28. and 21, 18 -- 25. 1 Cor. 6, 1 -- 5. and 12, 28. 2

3 chap.

Where, both for private dealing and public proceeding with sinners, see the
Scriptures here cited before, and the like. And more particularly, for
secluding, suspending and debarring from the Lords Table, or other holy things
and meetings also of the church, Of suspension.
see both the Scriptures aforesaid that concern this matter, namely, Genesis 3,
22, 23, 24. Lev. 13 chapter Numb. 9, 5, 10, 11. and 12, 14. and 19, 11, 12, 13,
etc. Deuteronomy. 24, 8, 9. 2 Chronicles, 23, 19. Ezra 10, 8. Ier. 36, 5. Luke 6, 22. 2
These. 3, 6, 14, 15. Jude ver. 22, 23. and these reasons following.

1. The Lords debarring and keeping our first parents by the Angels.
Cherubims from the sacrament of life eternal, that is, from the tree of life
in the garden of God. Thereby teaching the Governors of his church, to debar
and seclude such from the Sacraments, to whom in their estate they do not
apperteyne. Genesis 3, 22, 23, 24. compared with the Scriptures before cited, and
with Sal. Song. 4, 12 -- 16. and 5, 1. etc.

2. So likewise Porters were set by the high Priest, at the gates of the Lords
house, that none who were unclean in any thing, should enter in. Lev. 15 chapter
2 Chro. 23, 19. compared with Number. 19, 11, 12, 13. etc. and 9, 5, 10, 11.
with 1 Cor. 10, 16, 17, 18. and 2 These 3, 14, 15. Whereby also may appear,
that the duty, which men should be careful off themselves, if they neglect
it the Governors should look unto it, and see it be done. For which note
moreover, 2 Chro. 26, 16 -- 21. Mat. 5, 23 -- 26. Act. 20, 28. Heb. 13, 17.
Rev. 2, 14, 15, 20. etc.

3. Gods ordinance touching Leprosy, that the Priest in case of doubt, should
shut up the party for a time, and not yet put them out of the host: And then
after a certain time, as they should be found, either put them out of the
host, or pronounce them to be clean. The aequity whereof still remains.
Lev. 13, and 14 chapter with 2 Cor. 6, 14 -- 17. Jude, ver. 22, 23. Number. 5, 1 --
4. with Deu. 24, 8, 9. Whereabout withal note the Lords own dealing with
Miriam: set before us for instructton and example. Number. 12, 14. compared with
Deu. 24, 8, 9. and Romans 15, 4. 2 Timothy 3, 16, 17.

4. Suspension also may be considered to be like that keeping of persons in
ward, whereof we read Lev. 24.12. Number. 15, 24. til it manifestly appear that
the parties suspended are to be cut off and cast out of the Congregation:
Like as those words, Take away the evil from among you, being spoken by
Moses of putting to death in Israel, Deu. 17, 7, 12. and 19.19. and 21, 21.
and 22, 21, 22, 24. are by the Apostle applied to the putting out of the church
by excommunication. 1 Cor. 5, 13. where Paul uses the very same words, that
are in the Septuagint, Deu. 17, 7. etc.

5. Thus as sins and sinners differ among themselves, Jude, ver. 22, 23.
so shall also the censures and punishments thereof be different one from
another. A thing that was observed in the church and common wealth of Israel:
and is even by the light of reason regarded in all kingdoms and good
governments: and may be seen at this day in kings Courts and houses every
where. How much more should regard hereof be had in the church and house of
the great king of Kings: who has given most just and equal laws to his
church and people: and where all things should most orderly and carefully be
observed? To give particular instance in kings houses; where when men offend,
it is known that some are secluded from the Table, Presence chamber; or
Porches entry; some are bound or detained in the Porters lodge, or other prison
house; and some are altogether cast out and put from the court. So has the
Lord and great king diverse censures and punishments in his church, debarring
some from his table, assemblies, or entrance thereof; restreyning others in
darkness, and bynding them up as with bands of excommunication, till by such
means they learn to repent and amend; and appointing others (according to
their estate and desert) to utter darkness for ever. Of which more hereafter.

6. Thus also shall we not need, for some, to withhold the ministration of the
holy things of God from all the rest of the church, neither to interrupt the
public worship, or trouble the whole church by present dealing with such
persons, nor be driven to take any disorderly courses at al but using this
means of debarring and suspension of some (where there is cause) for a time,
we may with the rest still continue on our service and worship of God in peace
and holiness.

7. And for such persons themselves, thus there may also be trial whether by
this means they can be brought to repentance and amendment, and so be kept
from the greater and heavier censure of excommunication. Otherwise they may
afterward be further proceeded withal, if that yet they repent not, but do
still continue in their sins, or increase therein, adding stubbernes more
and more thereunto.

Iustif. of Separ. page 185, 186. etc.
By all which may appear, how greatly they err, who hold Suspension to be a
corruption and devise of men, and do neither practice nor allow thereof. Whose
error will yet more appear by that which follovveth to be spoken touching
Excommunication. Where first see the Scriptures before alleged, which concern
this point: Namely, Genesis 4, 14, 16. and 21, 9, Of Excommunication
10, 12. Lev. 13 chapter Number. 9, 13. Deuteronomy. 17, 7. and 19, 19. with 1 Cor. 5, 13. 2 Chronicles. 26, 21. Ezra 10, 8. Esa. 66, 5. John 9, 22. and 12, 42. and 16, 2. 1 Cor
5, 3, 4, 5, 11. and 16, 22. Gal. 1, 8, 9. and 5, 12. 1 Timothy 1, 20. Jude ver.
14, 22, 23. Revel. 2, 14, 15, 20, etc. and these reasons withal.

1. The known and ancient censures had among the Jews, and differing one
from another, to wit, Niddui, Cherem, and Schammatha or Anathema Maranatha.
Niddui, that is, separation, seclusion, suspension, or the less
excommunication: Cherem, that; is cutting off, or the greater excommunication:
Schammatha, or Anathema Maranatha, which is an utter devoting to destruction
and to the judgment of the Lord at his coming. Answerable whereunto among
Christians also are, Suspension, Excommunication, and the great Anathema: Or
(so to call them) the less Excommunication, the greater Excommunication, and
the greatest of all. Whereunto the Scriptures aforesaid may be referred and
applied. So as therefore they err greatly and are mistaken, who hold, that if
there were amongst the Jews in Christ's time any distinct ordinance of
excommunication ecclesiastical, Just. of Sep. page 187. etc.
it was a Jewish devise, and without ground of the Scriptures.

2. To which end may also be observed, the Lords diverse dealing with Adam, and
with Cain. Adam he debarred of access to the tree of life and use thereof,
driving and keeping him out of the garden by the Cherubims, as is aforesaid.
But Cain he accursed, and cast him out from his presence, and made him a
fugitive and a vagabond in the earth. Genesis 3, 22, 23, 34. with 4, 11 -- 16. The
one fitly noting out Suspension, and the other Excommunication.

3. Likewise the Lords ordinance of putting the Leapers and unclean out of
the host: the truth and equity whereof, as of the other shadows of the Law,
still abides. Lev. 13 chap. Numb. 5, 1 -- 4. with Deu. 24, 8, 9. 2 Chro. 26,
16 -- 21. 2 Cor. 6, 14 -- 17. Jude, ver. 22, 23.

4. The practice of Noah, cursing Cham: Genesis 9, 24, 25. of Abraham, casting
Hagar and Ismael out of his house, Genesis 21, 10, 12. of the Priests thrusting
Vzziah out of the Temple, and cutting him off from the house of the Lord. 2 Chronicles. 26, 16 -- 21. of the Princes and Elders, devoting the substance of the
disobedient, and separating them from the congregation of Israel that was
carried away captive. Ezra 10, 8. Which, whether it be applied to Suspension or
Excommunication, and understood of civil or ecclesiastical proceeding, or
both, it gives good proof and evidence for the point in hand.

5. Yea the very abuse of the censures, which was sometimes among the Jews,
does plainly show how they were the ordinances of God, though perverted and
abused among them, as were sometimes also other of the Laws of God. Esa. 66,
5. Luke 6, 22. John. 9, 22. and 12, 42. and 16, 2.

6. The Apostles doctrine and practice concerning excommunication of the
wicked, and delivering of them unto Satan. 1 Cor. 5 chapter 1 Timothy 1.20. Where
moreover is to be noted, that Take away the wicked from among you.
the words which are spoken by Moses of putting to death in Israel, are by
Paul applied to excommunication and putting out of the church: as I noted here
before, out of 1 Cor. 5, 13. compared with Deu. 17, 7. etc. So as this also may
both show us a ground for excommunication out of Moses, and direct us how to
walk aright in using of it, for the proceeding thereabout: when as all
persons, both the Elders and people, be careful to do their duty, and keep
their places answerably to the Elders and people of Israel: that so
(notwithstanding any differences of estate incident to them and us) yet still a
perpetual equity and due proportion between us and Israel may be observed.
Of which see more in the Treatise, which I vvrote some while since concerning
the exposition of Mat. 18.17. page 18. etc. And note vvithall, how the words
aforesaid (Take away the evil from among you:) are general and such as may
well comprehend the taking away of the wicked from among the people of God,
whether by death, or by excommunication, and the like: as Israel according to
the diversity of their estate and occasions used sundry ways, sometimes the
one, sometime the other, etc.

7. Whereabout further may be considered the term of judging, often used by
Moses and the other Prophets and Apostles: And how in judiciarie proceeding,
the Scripture uses this word, and attributes it sometimes to the Lord
himself, or to his Ministers and Officers in church or common wealth, for
hearing, examining, deciding, giving sentence, and executing judgment,
concerning persons and causes, civil or ecclesiastical: Genesis 18, 25. Exo. 18,
13, 16, 21, 22. Deu. 1.16, 17. and 16, 18. and 17, 9. and 19, 12, 17, 18. with
Number. 35, 12 -- 24. Deu. 25, 1, 2. 2 Samuel 8, 15. 2 Chronicles. 19, 5, 6. Psa. 82, 1,
2, 8. and 122, 5. Esa. 1, 23, 26. Ier. 21, 11, 12. and 22, 1, 2, 3. Eze. 44,
15, 23, 24. Micah 3, 1, 11. and 4, 3. Act. 16, 4. and 18, 15. 1 Cor. 5, 12, 13.
and 6, 1. etc. and sometimes to the people, for consenting, approving,
executing, and resting in that which is judged and done according to the
sentence given by the Lord, or the Ministers and Governors under him. 1 Cor.
6, 2, 3. with 5, 12, 13. Act. 26, 10. with 22, 20. and Act. 21, 25. with 15, 6,
22. and with 16, 4. etc.

8. Lastly, Christ's reproving of the Angels and Ministers of his churches, for
suffering evil persons and corruptions among them. Revel. 2, 14, 15, 20. etc.
Which necessarily implies, that the Lord has given an ordinance to his
church, for the restreyning, repressing and abandoning of such. Else why should
they be blamed for that which perteyned not unto them, or were not in their
power to redress and amend? The like also may be observed by Christ's speech
and commission given to his Apostles, and by their execution thereof. Mat. 16,
19. Joh. 20, 22, 23 with 1 Cor. 4, 1, 2, 21. and 5, 3, 4, 5. and 2 Cor. 10, 4,
5, 6, 8. and 13, 2, 3, 10. 1 Timothy 1, 20. And by the exhortations and
instructions, that are given to Timothee and Titus, in Paul's Epistles unto
them: and to the Elders of Israel, and the Primitive churches, recorded in the
Scriptures both of the old and new Testament.

3. And for the manner of proceeding, if the course aforesaid be rightly
observed, thus shall matters and persons be orderly and peaceably heard,
discussed, and judged: the governors and government according to the ordinance
of God regarded; and al good means used for the churches good and peaceable
estate; for the preventing and suppressing of manifold evils; and for the
benefit and reclayming of sinners: and such as are found to be obstinate in
iniquity, shall by publik authority be censured and excommunicated: and that
also with knowledge and assent of the church, the exceptions of al, if any be
brought, being heard, as is meet and in such cases to be done. And so shall the
church be purged from evil; the holy things of God kept from the pollution and
profanation of such wicked persons; the sinners themselves made more ashamed,
being made known unto all, and avoided by them till they repent; and the rest
that remain, shall all hear, and learn, and fear, and commit no more any
such evil among them. For which also see the Scriptures before alleged: and
Deu. 4, 1, 2. and 13 chap. and 16, 18. and 19, 19, 20. 2 These. 3, 6, 14, 15. 1 Timothy 5, 17, 19, 20. and 6.13, 14. 2 Timothy 3, 1 -- 5. Rev. 2, 14, 20. etc.

4. Furthermore, as in all other affairs of the church, so in these also
(according to the several nature of them) may the benefit of Gods ordinance
thus be enjoyed; and all things done in order; so as none be prejudiced, but
that every one may perform their duty, and enjoy their right and liberty: and
that both the corruptions of the Popish prelacy, and the defects of the
Protestant reformed churches, and al popular confusion, disorder, and anarchie
may be shunned, redressed, and taken away. Col. 2, 5. 1 Cor. 4, 17. and 11, 2,
16. and 14, 33, 40. compared with 1 Chronicles. 13 chapter and 15, 2, 13. and the other
Scriptures here cited before.

And because in this matter there has been, and still is, great question and
controversy among Christians, both Papists, Anabaptists, and Protestants of
all sorts, about the understanding of the words of Christ, Tell (...) unto the
church, and if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an
heathen man, and a Publicane, Mat. 18, 17. it shall not be amiss here also to
inquire further into the meaning hereof. Which therefore I will now speak off
more particularly in the chapter following.

CHAPT. XIX. Of the exposition of those words of Christ, Tell the Church, etc.
Mat. 18.17.
Whether those words of Christ, Tell it to the Church, etc. Matt. 18, 17. may
not be applied to the estate of the Jews, as it was when Christ thus spoke,
and to the estate of Christians succeeding afterward: I. Of the Synedrion, or
Congregation of Elders.
And first applying it to the estate of the Jews, whether they may not then be
understood of the Synedrion or Congregation of Elders had in Israel: for these
reasons follovving.

1. The like use of the word, in other places of the Scripture, where the
speech is of matters concerning government, controversy, complaint or pleading
about sin, or the like, as there is here in this place. For which, see Psalm.
82, 1. Number. 25, 12, 24, 25, 29. with Deuteronomy. 19, 11, 12, 16, 17. Josh. 20, 4, 5,
6. Mat. 18, 17. with 5, 22. and with 1 Samuel 2, 25. Number. 27, 1, 2. with 36, 1.
and Josh. 17, 3, 4, etc. Neither is it of any weight herein that some excepting
say, the Elders of Israel were civil governors, and dealt in civil causes,
etc. For Israel was the Church of God, asvvell as we, Act. 7, 38. with Deu.
33, 4. and their Elders dealt in causes of sin, and in the matters of the
Lord, as well as ours. 1 Samuel 2, 25. 2 Chronicles. 19, 8 -- 11. and the question
is, whether the phrase may be understood of an assembly of Elders, whether
civil or ecclesiastical, whether in Israel or with us, Mat. 18, 17. with
5, 22. and Deuteronomy. 19, 16, 17. and 21, 20. Psalm. 82, 1. Ier. 19, 1. and Christ
and the Apostles reason often, from the estate of the Governors and people of
Israel, to ours now, applying the things that are spoken thereof, to the
kingdom and church of Christ under the Gospel. John 10, 34.35, 36. compared
with Psalm. 82, 6. Mat. 21, 42. with Psalm. 118.22. Act. 1, 20. with Psalm. 69,
26. and 109, 7. 1 Cor. 5, 6, 13. with Exodus 12, 15. and Deu. 17, 7. and 19,
19. 1 Cor. 9, 13, 14. with Deu. 18, 1. etc. 1 Cor. 10, 1 -- 18. Romans 15, 4. 2 Timothy 3, 16, 17. 2 Pet. 1, 19, 20. etc. Not to speak of that, which the Apostle
expressly writes to the church of Corinth, touching the judgments of things
perteyning to this life. 1 Cor. 6, 4, 5.

2. The word is not Kabal (as M. Iac. Divine Institution of a ministerial
church. Argum. 3, Signature B^s, etc.
some have thought) but Ghnedah or Ghnidtah in the Syriack (the tongue then
used by the Jews and Christ himself) Which all grant, is often put for the
Congregation of governors, meeting at a known time and place, etc. Psalm. 82,
1. Number. 25, 12. and 27, 2. with 36, 1. Josh. 20, 4, 5, 6. Exodus 12, 3, 21. Lev.
8, 3, 5. with 9, 1, 3. See also M. Ainsvv. Counterpoyson, page 113. And note,
how R. Solomon understands those words in Lev. 4, 13. (If the whole Ghnedah
Congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, etc.) of the Judges of the
Sanhedrin, which represented the whole Congregation: As Drusij Com. in locu
difficil. Pentat^ch. p. 244.
Drusius notes upon that place. Besides that if the word were Kahal, yet As
M. Ains. himself also acknowledges. Count. p. 113.
that word also sometimes is used for the assembly of Elders and Governors,
the Synedrion, etc. 1 Chronicles. 13, 1, 2. and 29, 1, 6. compared with 28, 1, 2.
and 2 Chronicles. 1, 2, 3. Deu. 23, 1, 2. and 31, 28, 30. and so is translated by
the word Synedrion, in the Septuagint. Pro. 26, 26. For which moreover see
Psalm. 26, 4, 5. where for those words, I have not sit with vain persons, I
have hated the congregation of evil doers, etc. the Septuagint has, I have
not sit with the Synedrion or council of vanity, I have hated the
Congregation of the malignant, etc. or, the church of evil doers, as M. Ains.
translateth it: how ever he pass over that point touching the Synedrion, in
his notes upon that place. Which may the more be observed, because the Psalm
there uses the terms of sitting, and of taking bribes, and the like, which
the Scripture also otherwhere often ascribes to Rulers and Governors.

And now that I am speaking of this matter, it is also worth the noting, how M.
Ains. himself (a notable adversary of this exposition) cannot deny, but that
M. Ain. Animadv. page 13.
in the old Testament he has observed the word Church, to mean the
congregation of Elders. Yet to obscure the truth, and blind his followers
with vanity and error (what he can herein) he adds this gloss vvithall
concerning it, that now the old Testament is changed. And what if another now
should arise, and say in like sort, that in the old Testament he has observed
the word Church to mean the Congregation of the people: but that now the old
Testament is changed: would not himself readily discern and condemn the
vanity and error of such answers and assertions?

Wherabout note, that the speech is not of the legal covenant of works, or the
Curse thereof, neither of the ceremonies or any changeable ordinances of the
Law (as sometimes by the old Testament is understood) but of the Scriptures and
books of the old Testament, and of the words and phrases used therein.
Touching which, he says the old Testament now is changed. Which if it were
true, as he says, then should we be freed from the use of those words and
Scriptures, and whosoever observe them, should make Christ unprofitable unto
them. For so are we freed and set at liberty from the yoke of the Law and old
Testament that now is changed. Gal. 5, 1, 2. Col. 2, 8, 16, 17, 20. Heb. 8, 7,
13. Thus also he is fallen into the same error, which heretofore M. Ains.
Defense of Script. page 28, 32. etc
he convinced as detestable and blasphemous in M. Smith: who likewise
perverting some words and phrases of Scripture (as namely, that of blotting out
and taking away the hand writing that was against us, etc.) gathered
thereupon, that the written Law of Moses and the Prophets was now blotted out
and taken away from the church. And thus moreover he makes his own Annotations
which he publishes on Genesis, Exodus, the Psalms, etc. yea all the
arguments and proofs that in his doctrine or other vvritings he brings out of
the books of the old Testament, to be vayn and unsound? So as any that read or
hear them, might turn them away with his own gloss, and tell him that the
old Testament now is changed. Yea thus he annihilateth the proofs and
testimonies, that in the New Testament are alleged by the Apostles out of the
old: And takes away the means of persuading the Jews to the Christian
faith: with whom we must either reason from the Scriptures of the old
Testament, as being Psalm. 19, 7 8, 9. Prove. 22, 21. Mat. 5, 18.
the Word of God that endures for ever, and that has the certainty of the
words of truths or else what hope can we have ever to persuade them to the
faith of Christ?

But the Apostles teach us far otherwise then this Opposite that 2 Pet. 1, 19.
the Prophetical word is a most sure word, to which we shall do well to
take heed: And, that 2 Timothy 3, 16, 17.
all the Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable to teach,
to improve, to correct, to instruct in righteousness: that the man of God may be
absolute, and made perfect to all good works. To let this Opposite therefore
alone with his shifts and errors: I will proceed with the matter in hand.

3. Where observe next, the agreement of Christ's speech in Mat. 18, 17. with
that other speech of Christ, in Mat. 5, 22. Where, Christ in the one place
teaches the offending party how to carry himself, Mat. 5.22.23. etc. and in
the other the party offended, Mat. 18, 15. etc. and in both places, shows to
whom the brother offending may be brought, saying in the one place, Tell it to
the church or Congregation, Mat. 18.17. and in the other, he is in danger of
the council or Synedrion, Mat. 5, 22. Besides the agreement that these
Scriptures also have, with those other in 1 Samuel 2, 25. Deu. 1, 16. and 19.
16.17. and 21, 19. 2 Chronicles. 19.6, 10. 1 These. 5, 12, 13. 1 Timothy 5, 17. Hebr.
13, 17. and the like. And note here, how M. Brightman treating of this matter
in his exposition of Salomons Song, and applying it to the time of the Gospel,
says expressly, that he thinks, there is one and the same intendement of
Christ's speech in Mat. 5, 22. as is of that in Mat. 18, 15. etc. Of which
judgment are others also, whom I need not mention in particular.

4. Moreover the Syriack translation, in Mat. 5, 22. has Kenushta, which
signifies a congregation, assembly, or synagogue, where the Greek Original
has Synedrion, the Council or Congregation of the Elders. And the like
again, in Mat. 26, 59. Which plainly shows, how they sometimes use the
word congregation or assembly, where the Greek has Synedrion, the sitting or
assembly of the Elders: And is the more to be marked, because the same
translation othervvhere uses the same word KENUSHTA so generally, as it
puts it for the Greek word SYNAGOGE, the Synagogue. Mat. 4, 23. and 9, 35.
and 10, 17. where also it has BETH DINE, the house of judgment, for the Greek
SYNEDRION, the council or sitting of the Elders: so both using diverse words,
and the same words diversely, about these matters. Which may well be observed
likewise, for the better understanding of Christ's speech in Mat. 18, 17.

5. As also, that by the ordinance of God, the deciding of causes, and judging
of persons, is to be by the Rulers and Judges deputed by God, and according to
his word: and not according to the voices of the people, or multitude of them,
etc. Deu. 1, 16, 17. and 16, 18. with 1 Cor. 6, 4, 5. and Deu. 17, 8, 11. and
19, 17. Exodus 18, 15, 16.21.22. and 20, 12. and 23.2. 1 Samuel 2.25. 2 Chronicles. 19,
5 -- 11. Mat. 5, 22. 1 Timothy 5, 17. Heb. 13, 17.

6. And that the Elders and Governors are daily to attend hereunto, as there
is occasion; and for this cause (among other) are to have maintenance and
double honor of the Congregation: whereas the other men have their other
employment at home and abroad, and the women are to keep at home and look to
their household affairs, etc. Exodus 18, 13, 21, 22. Deu. 1, 16, 17. and 25, 4.
Prove. 31.23.27. Acts 20, 17, 28. Romans 12, 8. 1 These. 5, 12, 13. 2 These. 3, 10,
12. 1 Timothy 5, 17, 18, 19. Tit. 2, 4, 5, 15. and 3, 10. 1 Pet. 5, 1 -- 4.

7. Also, that the Elders sitting publicly at a known time and place, may
hear and judge the causes of their brethren, if the parties and witnesses be
present: though no other of the people be then and there with them. Deu.
1.16.17. and 19, 16.17. 1 Samuel 2, 25. 2 Chronicles. 19, 5 -- 11. Mat. 5, 22. 1 Timothy
5, 17.19.20.21. Hebr. 13.17. Where again may be considered that which I noted
before, how the Syriack has BETH DINE, the house of judgment, where the Greek
has SyNEDRION, the Council or sitting of the Elders, Mat. 10, 17. And
moreover that we read the people were hearing of doctrine in the Temple, whiles
the Synedrion and Governors were otherwhere assembled together. Act. 5, 20,
21, 22, 25, 27. etc.

8. Besides that as of old, so still the Eldership consists not only of
Ministers; but also of the Elders of the people; such as are chosen out of the
people, by the people, and for the people, in this behalf. And that therefore
this does no more take away any right or power of the people now, then it
did of old, but does rather in deed establish and confirm it still, and show
us how to use it aright, as in Israel heretofore: notwithstanding any
differences between our estate and theirs in other respects. Jer. 19, 1. 2 Chronicles. 19, 8. Ezech. 44, 15, 24. Deu. 1, 13, 15. and 16, 18. and 19, 17. with 1 Timothy 5, 17. Romans 12, 8. 1 Cor. 12, 28. 1 These. 5, 12. etc.

9. Neither may we bring or admit of any other understanding of this
Scripture, Mat. 18, 17. then such as agrees with Moses and the Prophets. Esa.
8, 20. Mat. 7, 22. Luke 16, 29, 31. Act. 26, 22. Hos. 8, 12. Mal. 4, 4. 2 Timothy
3, 16, 17. For Christ came not to destroy the Law and the Prophets, but to
fulfill them. And the Pharisees would have been glad, if they could have had any
such exception against Christ or his doctrine any way. Mat. 5, 17, 18, 19, 20.
etc..

10. Finally, both the things here going before (about private dealing with a
brother that sins against us, and the taking of one or two more with us,
that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. Mat.
18, 15, 16.) and the things also following after in this verse, where it is
said, Let him be to thee as an Heathen and Publicane, Mat. 18, 17. are spoken
according to the Jews phrase and understanding. And why not then also that
which is in the midst betvveen both: Considering withal that the speech was
unto Jews, and spoken by Christ that lived among them, and usually applied
his doctrine and manner of speaking to their estate.

II. Of the Christian Presbytery or assembly of Elders.
Next, applying it to the estate of the Christian church, whether then it may
not also consequently be understood of the Christian Presbytery and
congregation of Elders, or fitly applied thereunto: for these reasons
follovving, together with the former.

1. That Luke 2, 32, 33. with 2 Samuel 7, 16. Esa. 16, 5. Ier. 23, 5. and 33, 15,
16, 25, 26. with 1 Cor. 12, 12, 27, 28. Dan. 7, 14, 27. Mica. 4, 2, 8. and 5,
2 -- 5. Ephesians. 4, 11, 12. 1 These. 5, 12, 13.
Christ being now set on David's throne, as Christ himself is answerable to
David, so Psalm. 45, 16. Esa. 32, 1. 2 Chronicles. 19, 6, 10. with 1 These. 5, 12.13.
1 Timothy 5, 17. Hebr. 13.17. Mic. 4.2.8. and 5.5.
Christ's officers may be considered as answerable to David's, and Christ's
people to his: notvvithstanding the differences had between civil and
ecclesiastical estate, or other the like.

2. That not only the universal, but every particular church now, is as
Jerusalem, in a due consideration thereof. Whereunto therefore all careful
respect is to be had, in the Ministry, worship, order and government, in all
things moral and perpetual. Psalm. 87, 2, 3. Esa. 66, 20 -- 23. Jer. 3. 15,
16, 17. Ezec. 44, 15 -- 24. Mic. 4, 1, 2, 8. with Mat. 26, 17 -- 29. 1 Cor. 5,
6, 7, 8. and 9, 13, 14. and 10, 16, 17, 18. and 11, 23 -- 26. Romans 12, 3 -- 8.
and 15, 16. Ephesians. 4, 11, 12. Heb. 13, 8 -- 17. Rev. 2. and 3. and 21 chapter etc.

3. That an Eldership, or Assembly of Governors, for hearing and judging of
causes betvveen brother and brother, is an ordinance of God, once established,
and never repealed: and always needful to be had in the church of God. For
which see the Scriptures here before alleged in this and the former chapter.

4. That the Elders or Governors office it self, is also moral and
perpetual: not first and newly begun in the time of the Gospel: but continued
and derived from Israel to the churches of the Gospel, for the substantial,
divine, spiritual, and perpetual things belonging thereunto. For which also
see the Scriptures aforesaid.

5. That the grounds and duties of justice and good government, for righteous
dealing and judging betvveen a man and his brother, are also moral and
perpetual. Ibid.

6. That the very phrases used by the Greek Septuagint, about the cases of
death in Israel, are by the Apostle used and applied to cases of
excommunication in the church of Corinth. 1 Cor. 5, 13. compared with Deuteronomy. 17,
7. and 19, 19. and 21.21. and 22.21. And among the Jews themselves, when they
were under the heathen, and could not put any from among them by death, they
did it by excommunication; etc. as M. Broughton observes in his larger
Explication of Rev. 11.1.2. and 13, 11.12. page 109. and 177. and in some
respect may be gathered by that which is written Ioh. 18, 31. with 9, 22. and
12, 42. and Luke 6.22.

7. That in Israel also, such Elders as before time sat in the gates, did
afterward (when they were under the Romans, and dispersed in diverse
countries) sit in their Council houses and Synagogues. Where note withal,
that their Synagogues were ecclesiastical assemblies, in diverse respects: as
being such, where they met together for the worship of God, for teaching and
hearing of his word; where Christ on the Sabbath days taught and preached
the Gospel; and out of which they excommunicated and cast out such as they
cut of from among them, etc. Mat. 4, 23. and 5, 22, and 6, 5. and 10, 17.
Luke 4, 16. and 6.22. Joh. 9 22.34. and 12.42. and 16.2. and 18, 20. Act.
13.14.15. and 15.21. and 17.1.2. and 18.4.7. and 19.8. and 22.30. and 24.12.20.
etc.

8. And lastly, that otherwise we should transgress the Second and Fifth
commandment: bringing in a new and strange form of government, not or
deyned by the Lord: and giving way to many great evils in the church: as either
on the one hand, to usurpation and tyranny; or on the other, to popular
confusion, contention, despising of governors and government, etc. Testimonie^
of ancient and late ^ Writers.


Now hereunto also may be annexed the testimony both of ancient and later
Writers, touching the exposition of this Scripture. Among the ancient Writers,
Chrysostom expounds it thus, Tell the church, that is to say, the Leaders and
Presidents of the church. Chrysostom. on Mat. hom. 62. And Theophylact likewise,
Tell the church, that is, tell the governors of the church. Theoph. in Mat.
18, 17. And among later Writers, Calvin, Beza, Iunius, Piscator and others
vvriting upon this place, do likewise expound it: teaching that Christ did
here (as in other places) apply his speech to the custom and manner of the
Jews; and that the order which was kept under the Law, Christ transferred
unto us, because there is one common reason for us with the ancient Fathers,
etc. See their comment. on Mat. 18, 17.

And Bertrand de Loque vvriting of the Church, says, The word Church is
sometimes put for the Senate, or consistory of the church, that is to say, for
the Pastors and Elders of the church, who are in deed the conductours and
guyders thereof: as when Jesus Christ says, Tell the Church, that is to say,
the Pastors, Leaders and Governors of the church: according whereunto we see,
that S. John making mention of the consistory of the Jews, in which it was
sometimes determined, to thrust out of the Synagogue every one that would
canfesse Jesus Christ, he says generally, that the Jews made this decree,
although it was in deed the Consistory only. Ioh. 9, 22. Bertr. de Loque his
treatise of the church, page 3. M. Cartwright also treating hereof,
concludes, that seeing the church (in Mat. 18.17.) is neither the whole
Congregation, nor the Pastor alone, it follows that by the church, he
means the Pastor, with the ancients or Elders. Or else (says he) whom can
he mean? And as for this manner of speech, wherein by the church is understood
the chief governors and Elders of the church, it is oftentimes used in the old
Testament: from the which our Savior borrowed this manner of speaking: as in
Exodus it is said, that Moses wrought his miracles before the people, when
mention is made before, only of the Elders of the people, whom Moses had
called together. Exodus 4, 29, 30. And most manifestly in Joshue, where it is
said, that he that killed a man at unvvares, shall return unto the city,
until he stand before the Congregation to be judged. Josh. 20, 4, 6. where by
the Congregation, he means the governors of the congregation for it did not
apperteyne to all to judge of this case. Likewise in the Chronicles, and diverse
other places. 1 Chronicles. 13, 2, 4. T. C. Reply 1. page 176.

And M. Fenner teaches the same, saying: Seeing our Savior Christ, in setting
down the ecclesiastical Presbytery, speaks according to the Jews, for
otherwise the Apostles could not have understood him, when he said, Tell the
Congregation or Church, 1 Chro. 13 2, 4. Beza on this place
which was the title then given unto the ecclesiastical Senate; and his words
of having as a Publicane and Heathen, does manifestly prove, he meant to speak
according to their custom: It must needs be, that he did (according to the 1 Timothy 5, 17. Romans 12.6.7.8. 1 Cor. 12.28.
places before brought) ordeyne a Presbytery of Pastors, Teachers, and Elders,
like unto theirs of Priests, Scribes or Teachers of the Law, and their Elders
which governed only. Mar. 15, 1. Luke 22, 66. M. Fenners Counterp. page 138.
And again, Whatsoever offices are necessary in every Congregation for
discipline, after the second private admonition, they are perpetual: otherwise
the remedy Christ has appointed for sinners is not perpetual. But an
assembly of Governors in express words of Christ, are necessary (...) every
congregation for discipline, after the second private admonition, Matthew. 18,
17. Therefore such an assembly is perpetual. Defense of the Counterp. against
D. Copequo^^ Sermon, B. 4. M. Vdall likewise has the same, saying, Whatsoever
Christ ba^^ ordained, as a means to keep men in obedience to the Gospel, that
same must be in every congregation: for particular men are in particular
congregations: But Christ has ordained the Eldership for that end, as
appears Mat. 18, 15. etc. where Chrysostom. expounds Tell the Church, that is
(says he) the governors of the church: Therefore the Eldership ought to be in
every church. M. Vdals Demonst. chap. 14. And M. Brightman writing hereof,
would have this to be remembered, that the church (spoken of Mat. 18, 17.) is
not the whole congregation, but the Synedrion or council of certain choice
men. M. Bright. in Cant. 4, 3. Thus also In his answer to D. Bancrofts Sermon.
p. 11.12.
M. Penry expounds it.

To conclude, M. Broughton says, By Gods Law, Ecclesia, the Sanedrin court.
should rule in all matters. M. Brough. on Rev. 11.3.4. page 119. Again, The
Gospel has not a new discipline, but such as was in the Synagogues before
Ezraes time, and while Jerusalem stood. Quest. between M. Brough. and M. Ains.
page 32. And finally, Neither the holy Gospel, nor holy Epistles, teach any
thing for ecclesiastical government, but as the holy Synagogues did. M.
Brought. on Rev. 21, 6. page 303. And many more like testimonies might be
alleged about this matter: but these may suffice.

Another exposition also there is, III. Of the whole congregation, things being
carried orderly according to good government, etc.
(though disliked by diverse) which yet in a good understanding may be
admitted, so far forth as was or might be in Israel: namely, to take it of the
whole Congregation, of Elders and people; so as things be carried according to
order and the rules of government. Whereabout these reasons likewise may be
considered.

1. That in Israel (where all do grant, there was a Congregation of
governors appointed of God for hearing and deciding the causes aforesaid, yet)
the people were not excluded, but might come, hear, except, assent,
witness, execute, etc. And that therefore the Elders sat publicly in the
gates, Council houses, Synagogues, etc. For which see the Scriptures cited
before in this and the former chapter.

2. That in these cases, the Scripture uses diversity of words: as sometimes
Elders, Judges, Governors, Overseers, etc. Deu. 1, 16. and 16, 18. and 19.17.
and 21, 19. and 22.15. 2 Chronicles. 19, 5. Act. 20, 17.28. Romans 12, 8. 1 Cor. 12,
28. 1 Timothy 5, 17. Heb. 13, 17. 1 Pet. 5, 1. sometimes the Synedrion or sitting
of the Elders, the Presbytery or company of Elders, etc. Mat. 5, 22. Luke
22.66. Act. 22, 5, 30. and 23, 1, 6, 15, 28. and 24, 20. 1 Timothy 4, 14. and 5,
17. sometimes, the church, the congregation, the assembly, the Synagogues, etc.
Josh. 20, 3, 4. Number. 35, 12, 24, 25. Deu. 23, 1, 2, 3, 8. Psalm. 26, 4, 5. and
82, 1. Prove. 26, 26. Mat. 10, 17. with 18, 17.

3. That the people in Israel executed and inflicted punishment on those, whom
the Governors by the Law of God adjudged to death, scourging, banishment,
etc. Lev. 74, 14 -- 23. Number. 15, 33 -- 36. Deu. 17, 7 -- 12. and 19, 16 -- 19.
and 21, 18 -- 21. and 22, 15 -- 21. and 25.1, 2, 3, 9. 1 King. 21, 11, 12, 13.
Ezra 7, 25, 26. vvherevvith also note and compare 1 Cor. 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12,
13.

4. That in cases, where things are expressly referred to the judgment of the
Elders (as in Deu. 25, 5, 7, etc.) yet in the practice and observation thereof,
we find the people also to be present, and according to the present occasions,
to assent and bear witness, etc. Ruth. 4, 2 -- 9.10.11. etc.

5. That the Apostle wrote to the church of Corinth, concerning the incestious
person, how he had judged, in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when they
were gathered together, and his spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to deliver him unto Satan: 1 Cor. 5, 3, 4, 5. And when he was
rebuked by many, upon his repentance also to forgive him, and comfort him, and
confirm their love unto him, etc. 2 Cor. 2, 6, 7, 8. etc.

6. That neither the authority of the Elders should abridge the liberty of
the people; nor the liberty of the people disanull or weaken the authority
of the Elders: but that both should be preserved and carried in good sort. For
which see the Scriptures here before alleged.

7. And finally, that all things of public nature, apperteyning to the
public, be orderly, and according to the nature of them, publikly carried and
handled, and duly also made known unto all: reserving and leaueing to every
one (both Governors and people) their right, power, interest, duty, and
liberty, about the hearing, examining, judging, witnessing, assenting,
excepting, approving, executing, etc. so as is meet and right, according to the
word of God, as was in Israel, and the Primitive churches heretofore.

Thus, whether the words aforesaid be understood of the Jews Church, or of
the Christians since, or both: whether of the Assembly of the Elders (not
hindering or infringing any right or liberty of the people) or of the
Congregation of Elders and people, so it be according to good order and the
rules of government, M. Clift, Advertis. page 96.
it comes to a like end, being rightly understood: as upon occasion has else
where ben showed heretofore.

And this clause of being rightly understood, is very needful to be annexed
and observed: because diverse of good judgment think that these words are not to
be understood of the whole Congregation, as by some of the testimonies Page
312, 313.
here before alleged may appear: also because it should well be considered,
how these words may fitly so be understood, or could so be in Israel, in such
cases as here is spoken off, about hearing complaints, and judging of cases of
sin between brother and brother, etc. and specially, because that otherwise
(if they be not rightly understood with due caution and limitation carefully)
diverse errors, abuses, and erroneous courses, M. Ains. M. Rob. M. Jacob. M.
Smith, etc.
by diverse, have been gathered, received, pleaded for, and urged ernestly
hereabout. As namely, 1. that this speech of Christ may not be understood of
the Jews Synedrion, nor of the Christian Presbytery or Congregation of
Elders now; but that so to understand it, is error and sin. 2. That an
Elder cannot with good conscience govern and perform his duty in a church
that is persuaded so to walk. Their errors, abuses, and sinful courses, etc.
3. That it takes away the power of the Church. 4. That it is to be
understood of men women and children, in their own persons, that can sorrow
and rejoice, who are also bound in their own persons to be present to hear and
judge of causes and controversies between brother and brother. 5. And that the
people are to have voices in excommunications, and in judging of causes and
persons, as in election of their Officers. 6. That in a controversy, the
sentence is to go out according to the number of the voices of the greater
part of the people, though all the Elders and other brethren be against them. 7.
That the greater part of the people is the church here spoken off, though they
be in error, and though that all the Elders and other brethren be against them
therein, as is aforesaid. 8. That the members of any one church, are to have
voices in every Church where they come, in the elections and excommunications
thereof, etc. 9. That the government is popular by the multitude. 10, That the
kingdom of heaven, is a term peculiar only to the churches of the Gospel,
and not perteining to the church of the Jews. Contrary to Mat. 22.2. and
21.43. and 8.12, etc.
That the Elders may not admonish a sinner, though obstinate in transgression,
(whereupon to proceed against him) without first taking the peoples consent so
to admonish and proceed with him. 11. That it is a new rule, which could not
be kept in Israel, when Christ spoke it. 12. That the people now have more
power in the government of the Church, then they had in Israel heretofore.
13. That they could not in Israel forgive one another sin, as we can now.
14. That the people now, are answerable to the Elders of Israel then. 15.
That cases of sin and controversy between man and man are to be heard and
judged by the church on the Lords day, and as a part of Gods worship: which
M. Ains. Defense of Script. page 10. with his Annot. on Exo. 20 10.
themselves grant was not so in Israel. 16. That the churches government is
not Aristocraticall. 17. That the Elders may not hear and determine the cases
aforesaid, unless the people be present, although the parties and vvitnesses
be there ready to have their matters heard and judged. 18. That the raynes of
government in the church are not committed to the Elders. 19. That the Saints
as kings rule the visible Church. 20. That the Eldership is not the head, in
respect of the other brethren, as Paul speaks of the head, 1 Cor. 12, 21. 21.
That the people are Rulers properly, and the Governors of the Elders. 22. That
persons will not accept of the admonitions given by the Pastor or other
Elders, but say, if the Church admonish them, they will rest. 23. That they will
not give honor to such erroneous government. 24. That the Ministers and
Officers of the church are foreign Ministers, a foreign aid and
assistance, an unnatural monstrous and adulterous interposition. 25. That
ecclesiastical officers have not offices of authority. 26. That the order of
Saints or Saintship in the church is an order superior unto and above the
order of Officers, or of Bishopric or Eldership. 27. That the order of Saints
is an order of kings (which is the highest order in the church) sitting upon
the thrones of David for judgment. 28. That Suspension is a corruption and
devise of men. 29. That the Church of Israel had not power to cast out
offenders. 30. That if there were amongst the Jews in Christ's time a distinct
ordinance of excommunication ecclesiastical, it was a Jewish devise, and
without ground of the Scriptures. 31. That no good writers use the word
ECCLESIA for the Congregation of Elders: As if the Septuagint were not good
vvriters; or that this may not be a Synechdochicall speech, as there are many
in the Scriptures, Genesis 3, 20. and 9, 6. Exodus 20, 18, 19. with Deu. 5, 23.
Lev. 9, 1, 3. in the Septuagint. 1 Samuel 8.4, 7. etc. 2 Samuel 7, 7. with 1 Chronicles.
17, 6. Mar. 16, 15. Col. 1, 23. John 9, 22. etc. or that GHNIDTAH were not the
word used in the Syriack; or that it were never used for the assembly of
governors. 32. That this place may be understood The Prelates, etc.
of one alone, as of the Pastor or Bishop. 33. That by these opinions, Gods
ordinance of the Synedrion, Consistory or Presbytery is lost and abrogated.
34. And the difference between the Synedria or the Councils and the Synagogues
annihilated or taken away. 35, That seeing the Elders are not called ARCHONTES
in all the New Testament, therefore they are not to rule the church of God. 36.
That if the Elders be stewards only over the servants, and not Lords over the
wife (the church) then is not the church to obey or submit unto them: And that
therefore it is a fallacy a conjunctione and divisione to reason thus; All the
particular members must obey the Elders in their lavvfull instructions and
their wholesome admonitions severally: Ergo the whole body (or whole flock)
must jointly obey the voice of the Elders, etc.

These and other like errors, false doctrines, and sinful courses have been
conceived and urged by diverse: not all by any one, but some by one, some by
others: their toungues being exceedingly divided among themselves about these
things. By which also may appear, how needful it is to search out the
meaning of this Scripture, and carefully to observe it, still looking unto
Israel, and to the right understanding thereof, what we can. And this the
more, considering that M. Ains. and his followers, etc
some are so very peremptory and stiffly conceited in their opinions concerning
these things, as they fear not to make schismatic divisions and notorious
scandals thereabout, contrary to the doctrine, which we have learned of the
Prophets and Apostles. For which cause, they are to be marked and avoided of
all, that love the truth, and seek their conversion and amendment. Romans 16,
17. with 1 Cor. 11, 18, 19. Gal. 5, 19, 20. Ephesians. 5, 11. Jude ver. 19.

CHAPTER XX. Of the maintenance of the Ministers and other officers of the
church.
Whether it be not the duty of all Churches, and of the members thereof, every
one, according to their ability, to give maintenance unto their Ministers, and
(as there is occasion) to the Elders also that rule the church, and to the
Deacons and Deaconesses that serve and minister therein. 1 Cor. 9, 7 -- 14.
Gal. 6, 6. Romans 15, 27. 1 These. 5, 12, 13. 1 Timothy 5, 3, 17, 18. compared with
Exodus 20, 12. Prove. 3, 9, 10. Lev. 24, 8, 9, Number. 18, 8 -- 32. Deu. 12, 19. and
16, 16, 17. and 18, 1 -- 8. Josh. 21 chapter 1 Samuel 9, 6, 7, 8. 2 King 4, 8, 9, 10,
22, 23, 42, Luke 8, 1, 2, 3. and 21, 1 -- 4. 2 Chronicles. 31, 2 -- 21. Neh. 10, 32
-- 39, Esa. 30, 20, 24. Ezec. 44, 28, 29, 30. Mal. 3, 8, 9, 10.

1. Because the Lord has ordained, that so it should be. 1 Cor. 9, 13, 14.
Gal. 6, 6. 1 These. 5, 13. 1 Timothy 5, 3, 17, 18. compared with Numb. 18, 8 -- 32.
Deu. 18. 1 -- 5. and 25, 4. 2 Chronicles. 31, 2 -- 21.

2. And thus we shall honor the Lord with our substance: which has the
promise of blessing from the Lord. Prove. 3, 9, 10. Ezec. 44, 30. Mal. 3, 8 --
12. with Exodus 20.12. and 1 Timothy 5, 17.

3. Besides that it is no great thing, but our duty to minister unto them in
carnal things, of whose spiritual things we are made partakers. 1 Cor. 9,
11. Romans 15, 27. Gal. 6, 6. 1 These. 5, 13.

4. Yea who planteth a vineyard, and eats not of the fruit thereof? Or who
fedeth a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock? 1 Cor. 9, 7. etc.

5. Finally, the Apostle teaches expressly, Let the Elders that rule well, be
counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and
doctrine. For the Scripture says, Thou shall not mousell the ox that treads
out the corn: and, The labourer is worthy of his reward. 1 Timothy 5, 17, 18.
with Deu. 25, 4. 1 Cor. 9, 8, 9, 10. Mat. 10, 10.

But where any churches are poor, and not able to maintain themselves, their
Officers, or poor among them: that there they should be helped by other
churches of better means and greater ability; according to their several
estate and occasions. 2 Cor. 8, and 9 cha. Act. 11, 27 -- 30. Romans 15, 25, 26,
27. Gal. 2, 9, 10. and 6, 10. Phil. 4, 10 -- 19. together with the Scriptures
aforesaid.

It does in deed lie also upon Kings and all other Magistrates (within their
dominions, cities, and jurisdictions) to have special care of the estate of the
ministers and churches under them, as of all other duties concerning religion
apperteyning unto them: after the example of Hezekiah king of Judah, and
Nehemiah the Prince, and other the like. 2 Chronicles. 31, 2 -- 21. with 29, and 30
chap. Nehem. 10, 32 -- 39. and 12, 44 -- 47. and 13, 10 -- 14. with Deu. 17,
18, 19, 20. Yet notvvithstanding, this should not hinder the foresaid duty of
the churches and people themselves: but should rather further it: and that not
only in affording help where there is want; but also in requiring of such as
are able, that this duty be carefully performed by themselves, where by the
flock and church it self it can be done: according to the examples aforesaid.

This point concerning the Ministers maintenance is the more to be observed,
that not only care may be had for such as are faithful and laborious, to be
encouraged in the Law of the Lord, but that (what in us is) the way may be
stopped, and the means taken away of mainteyning Popish Priests, and other
erroneous Ministers: who are wont often (where Antichristian or other
corruptions prevail) to succeed and come after such as are sound in the faith,
and to be taken into their places: and so to have the same maintenance, as the
other had before. Besides that where the Ministers have their maintenance only
of the Magistrates, it may be a means to draw such as are weak or not
sincere, to carry themselves in their Ministry and religion, so as may please
the Magistrates, by whom they are mainteyned: either being unsound in the
faith, or not doing the work of the Ministry with that courage and
faithfulness as becomes the Ministers of Christ, and the household-stewards of
the mysteries of God.

CHAPT. XXI. Touching the remnants and monuments of Idolatry or superstition.
Whether it be not Deuteronomy. 7, 5, 6, 25, 26. and 12.1, 2, 3, 4, 30, 31. and 14,
1, 2. with 17, 18, 19, 20. Genesis 35, 1 -- 4. Judge. 2, 3. 2 King, 10, 26 -- 29.
and 18, 4. and 23, 12 -- 15. 2 Chronicles. 17, 6. and 30, 14. and 31, 1. and 34
chap. with 33, 17. and Lev. 17, 3, 4. and 14, 33 -- 45. Esa. 27, 9. Rev. 17,
16. compared with
the duty of the Magistrate, to take away and demolish all remnants and
monuments of Idolatry and superstition, Images, Altars, Temples, garments, and
the like, with all manner of false worship whatsoever. And where this is not
fully done, whether Exodus 20, 4, 5, 6. and 23, 13. Josh. 23, 7. 1 King. 18, 32.
Esa. 17, 7, 8. and 30, 22. Dan. 1, 8. Jude, ver. 23. with Lev. 13, 47, 51. and
14, 46, 47, with ver. 33, 45. Hos. 2, 16. and 4, 17. and 8, 11, 14. Joel. 3,
5. Act. 17, 13. and 19, 26, 27. 1 Cor. 8, 10, and 10, 14 -- 18 -- 21. 2 Cor. 6,
16, 17. Psalm. 16, 4. Rev. 2, 14, 20. and 3, 4. and 18, 4, 11, 12. etc.
it be lawful for the reformed Churches and sincere worshippers of God, to
retain and use such idolatrous monuments, or remnants of superstition, in the
divine service and worship of God.

1. Seeing the second commandment forbids not only the Images themselves in
the service of God, but all their appurtenances: as their manner of worship,
altars, priests, chapels, Temples, sacrifices, vestments, feast days, etc.
Exodus 20.4.5.6. and 23.13. with Deu. 12.2.3.30.32. and 17.18.19.20. 1 King.
12.28 -- 33. and 2 King. 10.26.27.28. and 16.10 -- 16. and 18 4. and 23.12 --
15. 2 Chronicles. 17.6. Esa. 17.7.8. and 27.9. and 30.22. Hos. 2.16.17. Act. 1^.23.
and 19.26.27. Jude, ver. 23. with Lev. 13.47.51.52. 2 Cor. 6.16.17.

2. And in Israel it sufficed not to remove the Images and Altars alone, but
they were also bound to abandon the Idol houses, and not to use them at all for
sacrifice to the Lord: in stead of which sacrifices, we have now the Lords
supper: as has upon other occasion ben noted here before. 1 Cor. 10.16.17.18.
Deu. 12.2.3.4.5.6.7.13.14. and 16.2.5.6. 2 King. 15.35. 2 Chronicles. 33, 17. with
Exodus 20, 4.5.6.

3. The reformed Churches also now blame the Lutherans for reteyning Images and
Altars still in their Temples, whenas they reteyne the Idol temples
themselves. In which respect they should be the more careful hereabout.

Or if the case be such that some of these things be rejected (as the Images,
Altars, vestments, etc.) and some retained (as the Temples, and chapels, etc.)
and some churches (being otherwise well freed from Antichrists corruptions)
cannot be persuaded but that these are lawful, or at least tolerable to be
kept still: whether then the ministers or members of such churches,
disallowing them, may therefore leave those churches in this behalf, after they
have used all good means of persuasion and dealing thereabout. Or whether
they, and other churches also that do not approve or use them, should now
rather (with protestation or other like signification of their mind) bear
with them, and be borne with also, in these and the like differences; waiting
till it please God to reveal or work further, as he sees to be best; and
still endeavoring to grow up in the truth, and to nourish mutual love and
peace one with another; and (what they can) to have communion in the things,
whereof both are persuaded, or wherein they shall not themselves personally
offend, and partake with other men's sins. For which see also the Scriptures
aforesaid, and compare with them, Psalm. 122.6 -- 9. Prove. 23, 23. Eccles. 7,
16, 17, 18. Mar. 9.38.39.40.50. Act. 21.18 -- 26. 1 Cor. 4.6.7. and 9.19 -- 23.
and 11.16. 2 Cor. 13.8. Ephesians. 4.1 -- 13. Phil. 2.1 -- 4. and 3.15.16. 1 Timothy
5.22. 2 Timothy 2.13. Rev. 2. and 3 chap.

And this the more to be thought upon, seeing that now there is not any one
place holy, and peculiarly consecrate to the ministration of the Lords supper,
as there was of old for sacrifice only at Jerusalem.

2. So as now therefore a place being a general circumstance that perteyneth
to all actions, it has in this case (as clothes also have) a civil use,
commodious and necessary for people to meet in together, and to be kept from
injury and unseasonablenes of the vveather, etc.

3. And sundry things and persons there are, which being not taken away by the
Magistrates (as they ought to be) men may have a good and lawful use of them,
so long as they are suffered to remayn. Deu. 13.12 -- 18. Mat. 5, 32. 1 Cor. 5,
1, 2, 13. with 2 Cor. 2, 6, 7, 8.

Here therefore may for the premises be considered that Corollarie, which M.
Gomarus has at the end of his disputation, touching the civil Magistrate:
where he comes thus far, that he says, the godly magistrate ought not,
neither can with good conscience permit to the Papists that live in his
dominion and are subject unto him, to have the use of the Temples for exercise
of their idolatrous worship, and preaching of heretical doctrine: but rather
if they have any they are either to be demolished and overthrovven together
with all Idols and false worship, or at least they are to see them purged, and
all superstitions to be removed and taken away. Compend. Theolog. thesibus in
Academ. Lougduno Bat. concinnatum Disput. 63.

CHAPTER XXII. Of the solemnization of Marriage.
Whether the having and using of a set Leitourgie prescribed to the Ministers
for the celebration of marriage, as for other duties of their calling, may not
argue, that it is counted as a part of their ministry and ecclesiastical
function: whereas it is a civil thing, in the nature thereof: and accordingly
to be used with thankesgiving: being sanctified by the word of God and prayer:
as the Apostle speaks in another case of meats; (which in another respect
also he speaks off, together with marriage) 1 Timothy 4.4.5. And whether the
solemnization of marriage should not therefore be done, by the Fathers or Tutors
of the parties married; or by the civil Magistrate; rather then by the
Ministers, as a part of their ecclesiastical administration. Genesis 2, 22.23.24.
and 29.21.22. Ruth 4, 1 -- 13. 1 Cor. 7, 2. Heb. 13, 4. with 2 Timothy 3, 16, 17.

1. Because we find not in the Scriptures, that it is a part of the
ecclesiastical administration, laid upon the Ministers by the word of God, as
a peculiar duty of their Ministry. Or if it were, then should the parents
and Magistrates offend, taking upon them to do a special work of the
Ministry, whensoever they should join any together in the band of marriage.
The contrary whereof may appear, by the foresaid places of Scripture, and
other the like.

2. And it appears, that of old it might be done by the Fathers, Tutors, or
civil Magistrates: Genesis 29, 21, 22. and, 41, 45. Ruth 4, 1 -- 13. with Heb.
13, 4. And there is no Law given since to the contrary.

3. Moreover, Marriage is honorable among all: and the bed undefiled. And the
very nature and institution of Marriage is such, as it apperteyneth unto all,
and not only to the members of the church: but unto al others, of whatsoever
religion or condition they be, even to the Turks and Pagans, etc. Heb. 13.4. 1
Cor. 7.2.12.13. Luke 9.60. Genesis 39.1.9. etc.

4. Else, where there were not the Ministers and Churches of Christ, there
could not be had any lawful marriages: as among the Heathens, etc. The contrary
whereof may be seen, Heb. 13, 4. compared with Genesis 39.1.9. Ester 1.9.17.20.
Mat. 27.19.

5. And the Papists, who think that Matrimony is a Sacrament, are the more
confirmed in their error: vvhiles they see that the solemnization thereof is
by the Protestants annexed to the Ministry of the word, and required to be
done of the Ministers, in the churches meetings, by a prescribed Leitourgie, as
if it were a part or peculiar duty of their ecclesiastical ministration.

But if that it be not so required, as a peculiar duty of the Ministry, the^
on the other hand consider, whether it may not also be solemnized by the
Ministers, asvvell as by others, and a blessing by them be pronounced upon the
married persons: so as it be not imposed upon them, as of necessity, nor
observed with superstition.

CHAPTER XXIII. Of the general duty of all Churches and people (in these
parts) concerning Religion.
Whether we ought not to leave the present estate of the church of Rome, and
to return again to the ancient estate of the same Church, and of the other
primitive churches, in the integrity thereof, as they were first planted by
the Apostles: And then also, Whether al churches and people (without
exception) are not bound to receive and submit unto that Faith in religion, and
to that constitution, Ministry, worship, and order of the church, which
Christ as Lord and king has appointed thereunto: and not to any other devised
by Man whatsoever. Romans 11.17 -- 22. 2 These. 2, 3, 4. and 1 Timothy 4, 1, 2, 3.
and 2 Timothy 3.1 -- 5. and Revel. 14.6 -- 12. and 18.4, 5, 6. and 19, 1 -- 9. and
21, and 22 chap. compared with the Epistle to the Romans: and with Mat. 28,
18, 19, 20. Act. 1, 3. and 2, 42. and 3, 22 -- 26. and 5, 31. and 6, 1 -- 6.
and 14, 23. and 15, 1 -- 35. and 20, 17, 28. and 21, 18 -- 22. 1 Cor. 4, 17.
and 5 chap. and 10, 16, 17, 18. and 11 chap. and 12, 4, 5, 6, 28. and 14 chap.
Gal. 1, 8, 9. and 3, 15. Ephesians. 4.4 -- 13. Ihil. 1, 1. Col. 2.5.6.7. and 4.17.
1 These. 5.12.13.14. and the Epistles to Timothee, and Titus. Heb. 5, 9. and
12.28, 29. and 13.17. Iam. 5.14. 1 Pet. 5.1 -- 4. Jude ver. 3. Rev. 2 and 3
chap. and 22.18.19. compared with Deu 4.1.2. and 12 32. Prove. 30.5.6. Sal.
song. 6.4 -- 13. Ezech. 40 -- 48 chapter Ier. 6.16. Esa. 60, 12. Ioh. 3.36. and
14.6.

1. Because the church of Rome was at first rightly set in the faith and way of
Christ: and is since fallen into great and deep apostasy; which the Lord has
begun to discover and consume by the light of his word; and from which he
calls all his people, to return to the ancient way, to keep the
commandments of God, and faith of Jesus, Romans 1, 7, 8. etc. throughout that
Epistle: compared with 2 These. 2, 3 -- 8. 1 Timothy 4, 1, 2, 3. Rev. 8, and 9, and
10, and 11, and 12, and 13, and 14, 1 -- 12. etc. throughout the book of the
Revelation: with which also compare the Scriptures here noted before, and other
the like.

2. The Lord also has promised not only to consume the man of sin, to
condemn the whore of Rome, and destroy the Beast, and false Prophet that
seduced the world: but also to raise up his Church again to the former
integrity, and to set up the new and heavenly Jerusalem in the ancient
beauty thereof. Which all therefore should further (what in us is) and
endeavor to attain unto: being assured that such as come nearest to the
synceritie of the Primitive Churches (both in the faith, and order thereof)
they are in the best estate: and that the nearer and nearer we come thereunto,
it is still the greater blessing of God upon us, and the more acceptable to
God, and comfortable to our selves: how ever it be with us otherwise for our
estate and troubles in the world: as was also the lot of the Primitive
churches of old. For which, see the Scriptures before alleged.

3. The like may be observed in other such cases of apostasy, that were in
Israel heretofore: how the vvoonted course of God still was to call his
people from such estate, to the ancient way of integrity, wherein at first he
had set them: And that the godly have also (in their several ages and
occasions) ben careful to hearken to the Lord, and to return and practice
accordingly: though some with more weakness and wants then others. Hos. 14, 1,
2, 3. Amos 5, 4, 5, 6. Jer. 6, 16. Esa. 8, 11 -- 20. and likewise in other of
the Prophets: compared with the history of Israel, in sundry ages and cases:
as with Judge. 2, 1 -- 5, (...) 1 Samuel 7, 3 -- 6. 1 King. 12, 26 -- 33. and 13,
and 14 chapter etc. with 2 Chro. 11, (...) 6. and 14, and 15, and 17, and 29, and
34 chapter with 2 King. 22, and 23 chapter Ezra 3, and 9, and 10 chapter Nehem. 13 chap.

4. And there is still but one way of truth, and of the true service and
sincere worship of God: And that in Christ, who only is the way, the truth,
and the life. Joh. 14, 6. and 17, 17. And all are bound (wholly and
continually) to that faith, which was once (for all) given unto the Saints:
and that so, as if an Angel from heaven should teach otherwise, we might not
receive it, but ought to hold him accursed. Jude, v. 3. 1 Timothy 6, 3, 4, 5, 13,
14. and 2 Timothy 1, 13. and 2, 2. Gal. 1, 8, 9.

5. Also the constitution, ministry, worship, and order appointed by the
Lord, is that only which has the promise of blessing from God. Mat. 28, 20.
Whereas the refusal or denial of submission to the Lord, makes subject to
the wrath and curse of God. Luke 19, 27. with Esa. 60, 12. Ioh. 3, 36. Rev. 14,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13. and 22, 18, 19.

6. Else Princes and people might now do that, against the faith and ordinance
of Christ, which they might not do in Israel heretofore, concerning the faith
and ordinance which then they had given them. Which were contrary to the
Scriptures, Heb. 3, 1 -- 6. and 12, 28, 29. and 13, 8. with Deu. 4, 1 -- 24.
and 17, 18, 19, 20. Esa. 49, 22, 23. and 60, 3. with Rev. 21, 24. Besides that
Antichrist also should have that yielded unto him in the ordinances of the
church (the city and kingdom of Christ) which no godly Prince will yield unto
him in the Common wealth: As to appoint laws, offices, orders, etc. for the
government and administration thereof. And it were also contrary to 1 Timothy 6,
13, 14, 15, 16. Esa. 33, 22.

7. And we should else hold our Religion at the pleasure of man, and not at the
prescription and commandment of the Lord, who is king of kings, by whom
Princes reign, and under whom all are subject, to yield obedience unto him:
As we do also look for salvation by him, Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20. with 15, 9. 1
King. 12, 26 -- 33. with 2 Chro. 13, 8 -- 12. Psa. 136. Deu. 4, 1, 2. and 12,
32. with 17, 18, 19, 20. Josh. 1, 8. Gal. 1, 8, 9, 10. Joh. 3, 36. Heb. 5, 9.

Yet notvvithstanding this hinders not, but that all persons, of every estate,
both ecclesiastical and civil, ought to be subject to the Princes and higher
powers, in the Lord. Romans 13, 1 -- 7. Tit. 3, 1. 1 Pet. 2, 13 -- 17. with Act.
4, 18, 19, 20. and 5, 27 -- 32. And it is the duty also of Princes and
Magistrates, to submit themselves and their scepters to the Lord Jesus Christ,
who is Prince of the kings of the earth, and to see the truth of God
mainteyned, and his ordinances observed, in all things. Neither may they at any
hand or by any means be drawn to oppose any truth or ordinance of the Lord,
nor to abridge the churches of any rights and benefits belonging unto them, nor
intrude themselves into the peculiar duties of the Ministers, etc. but must
rule over men in the fear of God, doing nothing against the truth or way of
Christ, but what they can for it: knowing that they are for the Lord, and under
him: and remembering what judgments came upon Ahaz, Jeroboam, Achab, and other
such Kings of Judah and Israel, who sinned herein greatly against the Lord:
and again what blessings came upon David, Hezekiah, Josiah, and the other good
kings of Judah, who were faithful with the Lord in the service of his name.
Psalm. 2, 10, 11, 12. and 72 Psalm. Josh. 1, 8. 2 Samuel 23, 3. 1 King. 12, 26,
27.33. and 13, and 14 chapter etc. 2 King. 16, and 17, and 17, and 18 chapter etc. 2 Chronicles. 19, and 28, and 29 chap. etc.

Finally, let us here also observe, that Lev. 4 chapter Josh. 1, 7, 8, 9. and 9, 3
-- 21. 1 Samuel 15, 1 -- 33. and 22, 17. 2 Samuel 21.1, 2. 1 King. 11, 3 -- 9. and
12, 28, 30. 2 King. 16, 10 -- 16. 1 Chro. 13, and 15 chapter Dan. 3, and 6 chapter Amo.
7, 10 -- 17. Mat, 15, 9. Gal. 1, 8.9. Col. 2, 20, 23.
no Princes, nor Prelates, Synodes, Churches, or any persons whosoever, can
make that lawful, which God has made unlawful, nor that unlawful which God
makes lawful. But Esa. 49, 22, 23. and 60, 3, 16. Romans 13, 3. 1 Timothy 2, 1, 2,
3, 4. Act. 9, 31.
Princes and Magistrates may grant outward peace and help to the Church: for
which (wheresoever it be had) we are bound to be thankful to God and them. And
Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20. and 1 Timothy 6, 13, 14. compared with 2 Chro. 24, 17 -- 22.
Eccles. 5, 8. Esa. 8, 11 -- 18. Dan, 3, 15 -- 18. and 6, 6 -- 22. Act. 4, 3,
18, 19. and 5.28, 29, 40. and 17, 6, 7. 2 Timothy 4, 6, 8. Heb. 10, 32, 33, 34.
and 11, 24, 25, 26. 1 Pet. 3, 14, 15, 16. and 4, 12, 13, 14. Rev. 2, 10, 11, 24
-- 29. and 6, 9. and 12, 11, 17. and 14, 12, 13. and 22, 16 -- 20.
if they will not suffer us with peace to walk in the faith and way of Christ,
according to the word of God: yet ought we notwithstanding so to do, obeying
God rather then man; and patiently to suffer what they shall lay upon us, even
to imprisonment, banishment, confiscation of goods, and death it self: leaving
them to God, who is higher then the highest; and knowing that he does regard,
and will require it at their hands; and will give a crown of life to such as
are faithful to death.

The Conclusion.
NOw to conclude, let us in these questions, and the like, still observe (what
we can) what was prescribed and received in Israel of old, according to the
writings of Moses and the Prophets: together with that which is recorded by
the Apostles, touching the Primitive churches since. And let us vvithall
carefully reteyne and follow that manner of reasoning, which is taken from the
example and estate of Israel, and often also used in the Scriptures of the New
Testament, how ever it be rejected, or little regarded by diverse, in respect of
the use and account which all should make thereof. Which we may learn by the
Apostles manner of reasoning, when he says, Behold Israel, etc. 1 Cor. 10,
18. Whither also may be referred the many answers, arguments, and reasons which
Christ himself and the Apostles took from the estate of Israel, and from Moses
and the Prophets, in sundry cases, from time to time. As may be seen in these
and the like places: Mat. 9, 10 -- 13. and 12, 1 -- 7. and 15, 1 -- 9. and 19,
3 -- 8. and 22, 23 -- 32. Mar. 9, 43 -- 49. Luke 4, 24 -- 27. and 16, 29, 30,
31. John 3, 14, 15. and 5, 10. with 7, 21 -- 24. and 10, 33 -- 36. Act. 1^, 2,
3. Romans 9, 6 -- 18. and 11.2.5. and 15.1 -- 4. 1 Cor. 5.1 -- 6.7.8.13. and 9.8
-- 14. and 10.1 -- 11. and 14.34.35. 2 Cor. 6.14 -- 17. and 8.13.14.15. Gal.
3.7 -- 13. and 4.21 -- 30. Ephesians. 2.11.12.19.21. Col. 2.11.12. 1 Timothy 2.11 --
14. and 5.17.18. 2 Timothy 3.8.9.16.17. The Epistle to the Hebrews. 1 Pet.
1.15.16. 2 Pet. 1.19.20.21. and 2.1 -- 6. 1 John 3, 11.12. Jude, ver. 3 -- 9.
Rev. 2.14.15.20.21.22.23. and 3.4.12. and 5.8. with 8.3.4. and 9.13. and 10,
9.10. and 11.1 -- 6.19. and 15.2 -- 8. and 16, 2 -- 8. and 18.2 -- 21. and
20.7.8.9. and 21, and 22 chapters.

To the Law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word,
it is because there is no light in them. Esa. 8, 20.

All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine,
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of
God may be perfect, being thoroughly furnished unto every good work. 2 Timothy 3,
16, 17.

Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall
receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.
Iam. 1, 12.
