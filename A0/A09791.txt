Tho. wyatis translatyon of Plutarckes book / of the Quyete of mind.

To the reder.
It shall seem hard unto the parauenture gentle reder / this translation /
what for short manner of speech / and what for diverse strange names in the
stories. As for the shortness advise it well and it shall be the plesaunter /
when thou understand it. As for the strange names stycke not i^ them / for
who that can take no fruit in it / without he know clearly every tale that is
here touched / I would he should not read this book.

Farewell.
To the most excellent and most vtuous princes Katheryn / queen of England and
of France etc. encrese and contynuaunce of much health and honor.
The book of Frau^ces Petrarch / of the remedy of ill fortune / at the
commandment of your highness / I assayd / as my power would serve me / to
make into our englyss^. And after I had made a proof of nine or ten Dialogues /
the labor began to seem tedious / by superfluous often rehersyng of one thing.
which tho perauenture in the latin shall be laudable / by plentuous diversity of
the spekyng of it (for I will not that my judgment shall disalowe in any thing
so aproued an auctour) yet for lack of such diuersyte in our tongue / it should
want a great deal of the grace. Although / as me seems / and as says this
Plutarch / the plentuousnesse and fair diuersyte of la^gage / should not so
much be desired in such things / as the fruits of the aduertysmentes of the^
/ which in my opinyon / this said Plutarch has handsomely gadred together /
without tedyousnesse of length / contayni^g the hole effect / of that your
hyghnes desired of Petrarch in his little book / which he wrate to one of his
friends / of the Quiet of mind / nerawhyt erryng from the purpose of the said
Petrarch. which I have made now of late i^ to our tongue not p^cisely (I
confess) without error as one should have done that had been of perfect lernyng
/ but after my rudeness / seking rather the profit of the sentence than the
nature of the words. but howsoever it be / if it may please your highness to
accept it / it shall not only be a defense for the symplenesse of the book /
against over busy serchers of other me^nes acts / when the good will shall
have the alowance of so virtuous a judgment / but also courage to the simple
endeavor of this hand / toward better ent^prises. And tho the smalnesse of
the present be great / in respect of that / that accords to your exellence /
the sentence parauenture shall not be much unacceptable / if it grieve not your
grace to mark it after your accustomed wisdom. Pleseth tha^ your highness to
pardone thouerboldnesse of your most humble slave / where he presents you /
for the good luck of this new year / with this his simple labor / and with
as much quiet of mind as this book pretends / always prayeng god to send
you thonorable desire of your virtuous heart.

At Alyngton the last day of Decembre. M.D.xxvij. your most humble subject and
slave / Tho. wyat.

Of the Quiet of mind.
I received very late thy letter / wherein thou exhortes me that I should write
so^thyng unto the of the quietness of mi^de and of those things / in Timeus /
that thou thynkest needs more exquisite declaration. Trewly / where as Eros my
friend was ready to sail toward Rome and I had received hastily of Fu^danus
the honest man the letters / and I had not therefore leysar to apply me to that
that thou desyredest / as I would have done / nor again could I suffer the man
to be seen sent fro me with empty hands / certain chosen things I have taken
forth of the quietness of mind / out of the come^taris that sometime I made.
And (as I think) i^ such declaration thou sekes not the delicacy of saying /
and the piked delight of spech / and thou have consyderatyon only of some
doctrine / to be as help for the life to be ordered. and I judge it very well
done / that where thou have great priualte with princes / and that not in
common things / and that i^ the glory of matters of judgment / no man is before
the / yet for all that thou dasyst not folysshly at the fawnyng of glory / that
wonders and exaltes the / as does Merops in the tragedy. Oftimes also thou
reme^brest that thou have herd / that sore toos are not esed with gorgious
shows / nor the whit thlowe with a ring / nor the hedach with a crown. For to
what purpose is thuse of money for the eschewyng of the sickness of the mind
/ or for the easy and sure passage of life? Or whereto serves the use of glory
/ or among courtiers appare^ce? Onelesse that they to whom these things
chance / can wisely use the^ when they have them: and again when they want
the^ / over suffer the desires of the^. and what any other thing is that / than
reason accustomed and fore thought / to restrain quickly / and not to suffer
to stray the apasionate part of the mind / wantyng reason / when it breketh
forth / and to suffer it to forbear when it is ouertwharted / with assayling
affections. Therefore / as Xenophon bad men in prosperous things chefely to
remember the gods / and to worship them than best / that when case required
with bet^ hope what so ever they need they might ask of the^ / thereby
contented and merciful. So those princyples that are most mete for to apese
troubles / must be taken and received before hand / only of the^ that are hole
minded / that long before prepared / they may be long most profitable. For like
as feyrs dogs ragyng at every voice / yet at one voice that they are used to
and know / they apese the^ self. So the wood affections of the mind / it is
no little business to order and apese / Unless the princyples for that purpose
used / be familier and ready at hand / that may clearly appese them / when they
are troubled and m^ued. Fardermore / they that are of opinyon not to do many
things / nor ^uat^ly nor openly / for the quiet passing of life. These first
of all will make unto us / quietness of mind of a dear price / as to be
bought / with sluggardy and slothfulness / and as tho he were sick / they
warn every man / as it were with this word / lie still wretch in thy bed.
Trewly where as it is an hurtful medicin to the body that deedly sluggardy /
nerawhit better phisicien for the sickness and trouble of the mind / is
sloth and tenderness / and faint heart forsaker of friends / kyn / and
country. Besides that it is false / that vnac^yfe men led a quiet life / for
else it must be that the life of women were more quietous than that of men / as
they that sit watchyng at home / occupied i^ huswifely occupatio^s. And yet
when somoch / as the north wind can not trouble the young maidens / as
Hesiodus says / the diseses of the mind / the troubles / the passion of an
ill thought / by ielousy / supersticion / ambicyon / and vain glory / whereof
no man can attain the no^bre / crepe nevertheless / in to the house of their
occupacion. Laertes lyueng twenty years i^ the country (as it is said) only
with an old woman to serve him of his meat and drink / fled from his
country and princely paleys / and had nevertheless sadness and frownyng debate
in company. what if that same / nothing to do / has troubled many from the
right order of the mind? as says Homere by Achylles / that he sat among the
ships folowi^g his ire / with ferme purpose / flyeng from the fight / and the
worthy counsayls of the nobles and the people / and dyuerti^g the name of men
vnactyfe / he fails in his heart / and again straight he seeks the batails /
and stereth him self i^ the cruel stryffes of Mars. Therefore / when he could
not suffer him self to wyther i^ ydelnesse / he says angerly / I sytte like a
deed lump of earth / as the keeper of the ships. Nor yet Epycure the alower
of voluptousnesse / is not their auctor / that are outher ambitious or desirous
of glory by nature / that they should give the^ to ydelnesse / but unto the
governance of co^mynaltees / as nature ledeth them. for men that are borne to
business / can not suffer with even and untroubled mind to be de^ued / of
that they most desired: Although like a fool / he calls them to a common wealth /
that can not hold them self from it / and not rather the^ that are mete for the
rule of it. Nor trewly the surety and trouble of the mind / ought not to be
measured / with multitude or scarsty of businesses. For to ouerslip honest
things / is no less displesaunt and troublous than (as we have before said) to
do foul things. But the^ also that have chosen one manner of life to be void
from trouble / as some do the life of these husba^dmen / some of syngle men /
and some of kings. Menander warns with these words / that they err far (as
they say) out of the way. I think o Phania that these rich men that need not
to make eschange for gain / nor to plain in the night / nor in turnyng them
up and down / to say often alas / sleep the sweet and soft slepes. but when he
came and perceived the rych men / as well as the nedy to be troubled / it is no
marueyle / quod he / they are of kyn and both borne at a burden / life and
trouble. for it is the fellow of voluptuous life / and of that brought up by
need it encreseth. And trewly / as fearful and sick folke^ out of a little
bote lepe in to a great ship and from thens again in to a galy / thi^kyng ever
to be better / till they perceive them self nothing the nere / and (as who
says) clean done / as they that carry the coler and fearfulness euerywhere
with them / so to take another and another kind of life / can not deliver the
mind from co^bre and troubles / such as ar vnknowlege of things / vnconsydred
adventure / nouther to know nor to can use a right things present / for a matter
that is happened. These things trouble the rich as well as the nedy / and
vexes with sadness the syngle men as well as the married. And for these causes
/ many that think much wealth is i^ opyn places / can not suffer a secret
restfull life. for these self same causes / it repents many / of that they
have begone / that with great labor have thrust the^ self in to the courts of
kings. It is an vnplesau^t thing of sick men / as Ion says / for the wife
troubles the^ / they blame the phecisyen they be angry with the bed / ye and
their friend noyeth them visytyng them / and again departing displeases them.
After that when the disese forsakes them and that by returned te^pre health
comes making althyng merry and plesaunt / so that he on the ton day that coud
not broke an egg nor fine bred / on the next day eteth hu^gerly wheti^ bred
and cresses. such effect and strength is there in resoni^g / for to change
each purpose of lyf^ / for the happy passing of the same. Alexander when he
herd Anaxarchus argue that there were infynite worlds / it is said that he
wept / and when his friends asked him what thing had happened hi^ to be wept
for. Is it not to be wept for / quod he / syns they say there be infyn^te
worlds / and we are not yet lord of one? Crates co^trarywyse / wearyng an
old cloak lyned with sport and laughter / as in holidays till his last.
Again to Agamemno^ it was grievous that he ruled so many / wha^ he said / Thou
shall know Attrides Agame^non / whom above all men Jupiter exercises and
troubles with labors. Diogines / when he was on the stone to be sold / he
scoffed with the crier that should auaunce the sale / and when he bad him arise /
he would not / saying at the last / what if thou should have sold a fissh?
And So^rates in his bonds did dispute of wisdom among his pursuers. Lo on the
othersyde / Pheton clymyng in to heuin / optayning wepi^gly / that his father
should take him his chare and his horse to rule. Trewly as a show may be
wrested to the facion of a diverse foot / but not the foot likewise to the
facion of the wrested show / So do the passions of the thought make each manner
of life that is offered the^ conformable and like to the^ self / nor unto the^
that have chose^ the best life custo^e makes it not plesau^t / as so^e say /
but rather wisdom makes the best life to be also most plesa^t. Therefore the
well of surete of the mi^de / spri^ging i^ our self / let us assay to make most
pure and clear / that those things that give us foren things and chau^ceable
/ we may make mete and according / in suffri^g with great uprightness of the
mind. For trewly it accords not to be wroth again things that chance
amiss. for our anger nothing pertayneth to them. but he that can amend by
craft ill chau^ces / he tre^ly does more laudably. Therefore Plato compares
man's life with the dyse / in the which the best cast is to be of the dyser
desired most. but how soever it happen / there should be a ware head / that he
use right that that the chance gives / whereof it is to parceyue that the tone
is not in our power / that is the chance of the dyse / the other is / if we be
wise / that we take with even mi^de / that that chance gives / and to give to
each of the^ his place / that that which chau^ceth well / may be most profit /
and that lest hurt that happeth ouertwhartly. But uncunning men / and ignorant
how to lead their life like sickely men / that can another suffer h^te nor
cold / as in prosperyte they are with an hye forhed outrageous / keeping no
measure. so are they in aduersyte / with knyt and bent brows foully distempred.
So are they troubled of both / or rather i^ both / of the^ self / and likewise
in those that are taken for good things. Theodorus that was called Athens /
was often wont to say / that he reched words to his herers with his right
hand / and they took them with their lift hand. Foles oftentimes when fortune
offreth her right hand / uncomely turnyng them self / set her on their lift
hand. wise men do better / that like as bees make honey a right sweet thing /
out of dry time / an herb of very byt^ taste / so of very unhandsome things /
often times they choose out some handsome and prefytable things to the^. which
thing would be much thought on / and labored with great exercise of the
mind. For as he that cast a stone at a froward dog / when he mist the dog /
and hit his step mother unware / It is not much amysse quod he. So may we mende
and turn another way fortune / when she chau^ceth otherwise than we would.
Diogynes because of his exyle / left his country / it was not so greatly ill /
for it gave him occasyon of lernyng philosophy. Zenon of Citius that had but
one ship / when he herd that it was perished / the maryners the merchandise /
and (as they say) every crom / Fortune / quod he / thou do very well with me
/ that drives me to mine old cloak / and to the porche of philosophy. what
therefore shall let us / that we may not follow them? Thou art fallen from some
rule or authorite / thou shall live i^ the country. Aplyeng thy private
business / with great compass assayeng to auaunce thy self in the princes
fauour^ thou art refused / thou shall live surely every where / with no
business laid unto the. Again thou art ta^gled with many cares and busynesses
/ warm water does not cheryssh so much / tender members (as says Pyndarus) as
honors and glory joined with power / does make labor sweet / and suffrable.
But some offense does trouble the / of backbityng / of envy / or nouhhty
sclau^dre / the best remedy is with the muses / or in some place of leruyng to
suffer over / as it happened unto Plato / as in a cruel tempest / when he was
taken i^ to the favor of Deny s^ Therefore it is of no little effect / for the
quietness of mind / diligently to mark noble and famous men / if they have
suffered any like thing / by those same causes / as by example / want of
children makes the sad / Look on the Romayn kings / of whom never a one dieng
/ left his reign to his child. Pouerte / thou cannat suffer with even mind /
who than had thou lever be of all the Boetians / rather than Epamino^das /
or of all the Romans / than Fabricius? But set case thy wife be not chaste /
know thou not thepygram of Agys in Delphos? Have thou not herd how
Alcibyades defiled Time a his wife / and how she was wont to name the child
that she bare / privily to her mayde^s / Alcibiades? yet that let not Agys /
to be a very worthy and a noble man / no more tha^ unchaste daughter of Stylphon
did let him to live the merylyst of all the philosophers of his time. which
shame when Wetrocles laid unto him / is it my faut or my don ^his? quod he /
thy doughts quod the other / but ^hy misfortune / how can that be? quod he / are
not fautes fallynges? yes quod the other / and fallynges / are not they also the
errors / of them that they are the fallynges of? true quod the other / and what
be errors? are they not the mysfortunes of them / that they be errors of?
with such a soft and resoni^g pesable spech he taught the vayn checkis of the
dogged man / to be but triflyng ^arkinges. Lo now / there are many / whom not
only the vices of their friends and kynsfolke / does vex / but in gods name
/ they also of their enmys. for scoldyng / anger / envy / folies / and combrous
riualytees ^ar the foulyst spots of the^ that they be in. yet they trouble
foles / like as the anger of neighbors or thiportunat famyliers / or the
noughty wits of servants / wherwithall I think thou be oftymes incued. And
as it is in Sophocles / the phisiciens wassh away the bitter coler / with a
bitter medicyn / so thou (not as aparteyneth the) again their diseses / and ill
affections of the mind / art angry / and answerest the^ with like sowernesse
of the mind / whithe things that thou do / a^ not meued with good and
thrifty manners / as most metest instruments / but for the most quod^e with
sharp and froward conditions. and truly for to correct these things / when
it is more than thou can do / ^o is it not esy by any means. So that if thou
can use these things when they grow / no another wise than these surgie^s
use their sharp scrapynge instruments / than if thou use them thus / beryng
always with the / as case requires / softness and mesure / truly thou shall
no more vex thy self / with others wantones and folly / than thou shall be
gladded with the co^sciens of thine own affection. for thou shalt think they
do it not without a cause / no more than dogs when they bark / do naughtly
of their nature. or else folowi^g such wekenesse and feblenesse of mind / if
thou care not to be troubled with others ylles / they shall disceyue the
wrechedly / daily suckyng up many troubles / flowing unto the / as tho thou
sa^est in a low bottom. what? many philosophers have reproved pity / with
which we are meued in beholding mesurable men / thynking that it is thooffice of
a good man to socour neighbors / that be oppressed in misery / and not to be
sor^ therewith / or with slack^esse of a low mind / to give place to fortune.
ye / and that that every man will say is more / they would not suffer us / if
we parceyue our self to have done amysse / or to be of naughty mind / therefore
to be troubled in our thought / and to be sorry / for without sorinesse / such
things should be mended / which when it is thus / consider well / how beestly
it is to suffer our self to be any thing wrath or angry / if they that we have
dealt with all do not gentylly and kyndly with us. Truly I fear me my friend /
leest the love of our self disceyue us / nor the frowardnes of ill speech
vexes so much the mind / as we prefer it over much deseruyng of our selves /
for vehemently / as it were with dasyng / to be affectionate to certain things /
and uncomely to desire and follow them / or again to be against them and
abhor them / no marueyle if these bring stryues and offenses among men /
when diverse men take it diversely / outher these to be taken from them / or that
they are fallen in to the other / but if any man / as chance requires / uses
him self with measure to be aplyable / which way so ever he turns him / he
surely lerneth / with handsome esynesse to haunt the company of men. Now let
us take our purpose that we left of the self things / likewise as to them that are sick of agewes / all things tasted / seems strait / bitter / and loathsome
/ till they have seen other take the same things / without any token o^
vnplesaunt savor / which they lothly have cast up / where at last they ley
the faut in themself and in the sickness / and not in the mete or drink. So
we / if we consider other that use with great uprightness of the mind and
merry chere / that that we pass not without playntfull heaviness / must needs
leave to be so anger with the self things. But truly for to keep constancy of
mind in aduersite / it is of great effect / not to forgete with a wynkyng eye
(as they say) those things that sometime has happened hapely unto us / as we
would have wysshed / and with due medlyng to way the prosperous things / with
every ill chance. But where / as wear wont to turn our eyes / that be dased
with beholding bright things / unto fresh and grene colors / for to refressh
them / contrary wise / we turn our mind to heavy things / and by force
co^strayne it to the remembrance of things most of repentance / and we pull
it away again the will of it / from agreeable and suffrable things. And here I
remember I may bring in metely / that that ones was spoken to a busy fellow /
medlyng in that that partayned nothing to him / what the myschefe ungracious
fellow / thou se^st other me^nes vices with kytes eyes / and thyn own thou
lettes pass / with wynkynge owls eyes? To what purpose good man do thou
consider so diligently thy harms / and renewes them always with busy
remembrance (and have no regard to that welfulnesse that is present? And like
as these surgen boxinges suckes out of the flessh the worste blood / so do
thou / all the worst of thy things / gader in to thy self / ^^ra whit better
than Chius the merchant / that where he sold much wine of the best / he
gadred to him self / the sower and deed wine. whose servant when he ran away
from him / and one asked him for what cause he forsook his master / answered
/ for because when he had good things in his hands / he sought for il. Many
like unto him forsakyng sweet drinks / give them self to sharp and bitter
dri^kes. So did not Aristyppus lene unto the heavy balaunce of harm / but
reched him self to the lyghter. He when he had lost a pleasant manner / asked
of one of them that showed them self most sorry and a^gry for his fortune.
Know thou not / quod he / that thou have but one little house / and I have
yet three good fermes left me? yes quod the other. Than should I / quod he /
rather be sorry for thy fortune? for it is like madness to be sorry for things
lost / not reioysi^g in things that be safe. And as little children / wha^ one
has taken from them one tryfle among many / castyng away all the rest / they
weep and cry. so likewise we troubled by fortune in one thing co^playning and
lame^tyng make all other things to us unprofitable. But one will say / what
have we? ye / rather what have we not? He has glory / he a house / another a
wife as he would wysshe / and he a faithful friend. Antipater of Tarsis dyeng
/ when he rekened on his fyngers / the things that he had had in his life /
he^ forgate not the good se passage / that he had out Cilicia to Athens. and
pardy / these common and light things ar not to be passed / and there is
co^syderacion to be had of them / that we live / that we are in health / that we
se the son / that we have no war nor rebellyon / that the ground is erable
/ and that the sea may be sailed with litell labor. ye / and for the last /
that we have lyberte to speak and to hold our tongue / to be busy and ydell.
Truly the possession of these things / shall give unto us / a plentous matter
of quietyng the mind / if we fasten in our mind thimage of the abse^ce and of
the desires of them / thereby warnyng our selfs (how health is much desired of
sick men / peace of them that are combred with war / how much desired unto a
streyer abroad / and unto an unnoble man is glory / and toptayne such a name
in such a cite. again how displesaunt it is / to lose it when thou have it.
And yet I think not / that any of these things or like should be so great / and
to be desired / that when it is lost / nothing shall be safe. for it should be
nowhit more esteemed for that it leueth to be. Nor they should not be possessed
/ as so worthy things / nor kept with such business / watching busely / leest
we be spoiled of them as so precious thiges / that we should therefore set light
/ and not regard things that we have safe / as tryfles. for these would be
used / and the fruit taken of the^ with gladness / most for that cause / that
wha^ chance happens / we may suffer more pesably and temperatly / the loss
of the^. But trewly / as Archesilaus said / some think it a great thing / with
diligent in tent of mind and of eyes / to behold others enditynges / pyctures
and images / exquisitely / as they come to their hands and they not regardyng
their own life / tho they that behold others chances / and look upon him that
has many consyderations and aduertysmentes / and they not vnplesau^t / like
these adultrers / that lothyng their own wives / follow other men's / err
(as the proverb says) all the world out of the way. For it makes much
toward the constaunt state of the mind. first to esteem him self / and his
own things / and the particulers of one / if not / at the lest to turn
thyntent from consyderacion of courser things / ^at as the common sort of
menlin diverse manner to wonder on the / whom fortune has exalted to the heyght
of things / when she lysted to sport. as by example / they that are in prison
think bondmen happy that are losed / they them that be free / they that be
free think them that have the law of cities in their hands happy / and they
rich men / and rich folk prouostes and governors / and they kings / and at
the last kings / the gods / whom (I had nigh said) it irketh also of their
godheed / outcept they might have power of thunder and lightning / so that
where they ca^ not be even with their superiors / they can not (as they say)
rest with in their bonds. I care not for the goods of rich Gygis / quod
Thasius / nor yet I wondre greatly at them / nor I envy the marvelous works
of the gods / nor yet gape I greatly after any ki^gdome / for fer fer are
these things from my eyes / said this Thasius. Lo now co^trariwyse such
another as Chius / or another Galates or Bithynus / not content that he has
gotten glory and may stership among the cytezins / but on gods name he must
ask pleyningly to be a senator / when thou have given him that he must be
provost / and set case that thou grant him that / than must he be co^sull
and when at last thou have put to that / all is not worth a pe^s / outcept he
be pronounced the first. And what other thing I pray the is this / but in
gadri^g causes of unkindness again fortune / to tourment him self / and him
self perpetually to punish him self? Truly a man well assured of his mind /
tho one or other of mortal people (where as we are six. C. times / hundred
thousand seers of the son / and children of the earth) pass him in glory of
name / or habundaunce of riches / sytteth not abject or lamentable with wringyng
hands (as they say) but rather where he sees him self better handled / tha^
an infynite multitude of undone men / as often as he comes abroad / he
reioyseth in his fortune. In the assays of Olympias / there was no vyctour that
might refuse to meddle with who so ever came first / having no lyberte to choose
his match. In our life the state of things gives lyberte to each man / that
co^pareth him self and his fortune / with many / and with the fortune of many /
to have an hye and an upright mind / and to make him thereby to be seen and
wo^dred at to other / rather than him self to wonder at other / so that he be
not so folysshe to compare him to Briarcus or to Hercules. So when thou
marueylinge / see some great man carried in a lytter / let down thyn eyes /
and look upon the berers thereof. Again when thou shall wonder on Xerxes / as
very happy / when he passed the straites of Hellespont / with a brigge shapt of
ship wood / behold also them / some their noses and some their eres smytten
of and ma^gled / by reason of the brig broken / with shaking of the furour of
the sees rage / brekyng in by Athon / and believe that they praise with great
commendacion / the and thy fortune. Socrates when one of his friends told him
/ that all thing was dear in the town / for wine of Chia was at a pound / and
purple at three pound / and honey at.v. shyllynges the gallon / took him by the
hand and led him in to the meyle house / it is sold / quod he / for an
halpeny the half busshell / therefore v^tell is good chepe. from thens he
brought hi^ i^ to the oil house / it is sold / quod he / for two brass pens
two gallons / al thing than is not dear i^ the town. So likewise we / if we
here any man say that our fortune is bare and wretched / for that we have
nouther the consulship nor other maistershippe / we may say unto him / that our
fortune is fair and goodly / and that we go not from door to door / and that
among porters and berers / we weary us not with burdens / nor like flatterers /
are constrained to be as parasites to princes. Although (for we are now come to
that madness / that each of our lives hangs upon other men's / more than our
own / and that our nature is so altered / in to a certain unkind and enuyous
affectyon / not so much to glad i^ our own / as to be troubled with other
folks welthes) if thou look not only upon those wonders / and famous things
in them / whom thou wenest very blessed / and (as they say) in Iouis lap / but
the curte^ and the fair trauers drawn / lettyng pass their glory and utter
appare^ce / if as well thou look with in them / thou shall truly find many
inwardes / sower and troblous. Pyttacus / whom the sure fame noyseth to have been endewed with wisdom / fortitude / and justice / when he was cheri^ggestes
that he had / it is said his wife ca^e and angerly overthrew the table /
wherewith when he saw his gestes abashed each of you / quod he / is troubled
with some ill / I am in this state always very well. This man that was demed
abroad to be very happy / when so ever he entered his threshold / he seemed to be
a wretch / I say not that he was one / where his wife had all and ruled pri^cely
/ where oftimes and always he neded to fight with her. Many things do trouble
you / no^hyng does trouble me. Many such like things do cleue unto glory /
unto riches / ye and unto a kingdom. but truly of the ignorant multitude
vnperceyued / for the po^pe is drawn / behind the which those things lie
hydde^. Happy Attrides glory of greeks / eueriwhere mylde fortune the favors
/ while she exalts her child. This vtward blyssednesse to be compased with
wepyns / horse / and arms / let us here likewise / the repentyng voice of an
ill troubled mind / cryeng against such excess of glory. Mighty Jupiter has
ta^gled me with grievous chau^ces / and i^ another place. O happy and blessed
that far out of danger / unnoble / and vnglorious / have ^assed their lives.
By these and such like declaracions / it may be se^sably parceyned / the
playntfull unquietness of the mi^de / scoldyng with fortune and casting away
it self with wo^dring at other / and to rise for top ^sse it self / and the
own things. For of troth it breketh marvelously the constant and quiet
state of the mind / with hyer intent to strive above the power to get any
thing as to sail with gretter sails than proporcion / as when hope shyneth
never so little / promysing folisshly unto our selfs unmeasurable and great
things / and than when chance follows not / we accuse wicked fortune and our
desteny / wha^ rather we should dam our selfs of folly / as it were to be angry
with fortune / that thou can not shote an arowe with a plou / or hu^t an hare
with an ox / and that some cruel god should be against them / that with vayn
endeavor / hunt an heart with a dragge net / and not that they attempt to do
those impossibilytes / by their own madness and folysshnesse. Surely the cause
of this error / is the noughti love of our self. For men / ouermoch deserui^g
of them self / where as with great strife they allow them self best /
enhaunced with pride / leave nothing vnassayd. For it is not enough unto them to
be rich and eloquent / and among merry and gladsome festes. but that they must
be famyliers of princes and in auctorite / but that they must have the best
horse and the best dogs and (if god will) the best cockerels and quayles / or
else they can not be quiet in theie mind. Denis thelder thought it not enough
to be the grettest tyrant in his time / but yuell content also / that he was
not so good as the poet Phyloxenus in poetry / and as Plato in the c^^ft of
resonyng / meued with ire / him he put in to a do^gion / and the other he sold /
and banysshed in to Aeginas. So did not Alexandre / that where he was greatly
meued with Brison / with whom he stro^e in swyftnesse of the chart / with
deliberacion ^emed plesaunt / forberyng his own right. Therefore Homere spoke it
very well by Achylles / such a one as was no^ among the greeks in battle / and
after he says / but there were other that were more eloquent. Megabysus of
Per^^a on a time when he came in to Appelles shop / he began to babble I wot not
what of the craft of payntyng. Appelles that could not suffer his folyes /
before / quod he / that thou shewedest thy self with thy words / I had a good
opinyon in the / by reason of thy gold and purple / auau^cy^g thy silence /
now the pre^tises and boys that grind me my colors / do mock thy babbling.
There is that thy^ke that the Stoyik philosophers do mock us / i^ discribyng a
wise man af^ their facion / not only to be wise / just / and strong / but also
an orator / an emperor / a poet / ye^ and a king. and they are not ashamed
to ascribe all these names unto him / although if they perceyu^ them self in
dispeyre of the^ / they are always il content / which how it accords with
reason / they may se wha^ that they know the gods contented / each with his
godheed to be satisfied / as to be called Enyalius / that has auctorite over
the furour of bataylc / another Mantous / that is over prophecies. another
Cerdous / that is ruler of lucre. So that in Homere / Jupiter forbyddeth to
Uenus werly matters / as nothing perteynyng to her / and byddeth her to take heed to marriage matters. Besides this / somthynges of the^ that seem to us to be
desired / accord not togider of their own nature / as by example. He that
desires the study of saying and of lernyng / he must be quiet and without
business / again auctorites and familyarite with pri^ces^ ar wont to make
busynesses / and to bring often co^braunces. Ple^tous use of wine and flessh /
makes a man strong and mighty / and the mind frayler and weker. Again /
unmeasurable diligence to encrese / or busy trouble for to keep / agrees for
the gadring of riches. A the other side / contempt and dispisyng / is a great
instrument for the beginning of philosophy / and almost the first and chefyst
exercise of it. So al things is not for every man / but he that will obey the
poesy of Appollo / must first know him self / and so take advise of his own
nature / and as she ledeth to take an order of life / rather than passing from
one to another / to force and constrayn his nature. An horse for the cart / an
ox is mete for the plowe / after a ship that sayleth / a dolphin is mete to
swym / and to hunt the bore a ^cirse dog. So that if one be troubled / for
that a mighty lion may not be norisshed i^ a womans lap / as well as a little
whelpe / surely he is a great fool. And he is ne^awhit wyser / that will write
of the world and seek the nature of things / both after Empedoclis facion or
Platos / or Democritus togider / or to lie with a rich old woman / as
Euphorion / and to be like those that were wont to ba^ket late with Alexa^dre /
as Medius / and think it uncomely and scant to be suffered / outcept he may by
riches be as notable as Ismenia / and by virtue / as noble as Epamino^da.
Ronners when they have their game / are content that wrestlers have their
reward / if thou have gotton / says Solon / the town of Sparta / order it
with laws and decrees. we will not change with you / says the sa^e man / vtue
for riches / syns the one is our own and stable / and riches is but chaunceable
/ and passes from one to another. Strato when he herd that Menedemus had more
scolers than he. Lo / quod he / is it not to be marueyled / if many had rather
be washed than perfumed? Aristotle writing to Antipater / it is mete says he
/ to be as glorious for Alexander / and to be consydred / not only to reign
over many people / but also to have beside other / a right opinyon of godly
things / so that they that under this manner / call their glad things
glorious / and not so little to be esteemed / they with out doubt shall not be
troubled / with wondering at strange things. yet now when none of us sees a
vine bear fygges / nor an olyue bear grapes / we braule with our self
nevertheless / and with ungentle gredynesse oppress our selfs / and are so
weary of our selfs / outcept we may attain to the highest degree / both of
richmen and of learned men / both at home and in the w^rres / both of
philosophers and of warryers / ye and both of flaterers and of them that by
trusty and free playnesse / are known to be true / and at last / both of
nygardes and wasters. Although that we se nature to tech us marueylusly. For as it
is seen by nature diverse beestes to feed for their lyue^g dyuersly / nor that
she would that all should be norisshed with s^edes or with flesh / or with
rotes / but as they are diverse to ete diverse meats / so has the same nature
given to mankind diverse orders of lyueng / as pasturyng / plowyng / foulyng /
and fysshi^g. we must therefore each of us choose that / that we know is most
metest for us / and with all our endeuoir give us to that / and to part from
the possession of that that we parceyue parteyneth to another / or else it is
to no purpose that Hesiodus said. The potter enuyeth the potter / and over the
smythes craft his fellow is envious. Truly now men are not led with envy of
the craft or order of their fellows / but rich men with envy of learned men /
nobles of rich men / men of law / of deceyuers / and of players and of
tomblers / and at the last / free and noble men of ancient famyles dasyng for
wonder at the good fortunes of men of bondage in the courts of kings / while
they think that all their own fortunes are to be lothed / they trouble them
self / and with no little cure of mind kill them self. Surely that every man
has cof^rs and receytes / and as who says springes / of surety and trouble in
his own thought / and Homers tonnes of good and ill / not as he said i^ Iouis
door / but with in his own mind / the dyuersite of men proves greatly / whom
we se by affections of the my^de to be diversely tempred. for foles let good
things pass tho they be present / and regard them not wha^ they perisshe /
so much does their thoughts gape gredily after things to come. Co^trariwyse
/ men of wit with sharp remembrance / reducyng them self to things that be
present / make those things that yet are not / to be at hand. For that that is
at hand and present / offering it self to be taken i^ on only instant / after
that unremembered / seems unto foles another to be ours / nor to partein to us.
and as the roper that is painted in Plutos house / as much as he did wreth out
of his basket in to his rope / he suffered folisshly an ass that stood by him
to ete / no notherwyse does the unkind and slothful forgettinge of many /
setting aside the co^modites of things past / the worthy do^ deeds / the noble
acts / the pleasant ydelnesse / the merry and gladsome company / and forgettyng
and scrapyng out all the delight of the life / suffers not their life to be all
one facyoned and weued together ^ with the things past and the things present
/ deuyding yesterdayes lif from that of to day / and that from that of to morrow
/ althyng do^ they make vndo^ / with the weryng out of their remembrance.
Truly they that i^ the scoles of philosophers took away encresynges of bodies
/ as vanisshing substance by wast / they only in their words made each of us
/ another and another than our selves. But they that contayn not things passed
/ as tho memory failed / nor again reme^breth them / they do not now in words
/ but in very deed / make them self daily more nedy and more void / gapyng
always on to morrow / as tho things of last year / of late / and of yesterday
/ perteyned nothing to the^ / and as tho they had never chanced unto the^. So
that the constant state of the mind / by this manner is troubled. And even as
flies slyp of wha^ they crepe upon smoth glasses / and in rough and rugged
places they cleue esely / so men slyding from gladsome and pleasant things /
hold fast the remembrance of heavy things. And like as at Olinthus / there is
a place they say / where in these horned flies be taken / and when they be i^ /
they can not get out again / but a great while flyeng up and down with in /
making many circles in vain / they dye at last. so men enwrapped in the
remembrance of ylles / can never after get forth nor get socour. Therefore as
paynters are wont in tables to underlay dym colors to the eyes / and to
en^lyne and draw fair and bright colors upon the^ so should men in their own
minds / all heavy and dark chau^ces / ouercouer and overthrow with glorious
and fair chau^ces / worthy to be remembered. for things past can not clearly
be fordone / nor be again afterward / by man only. For so variable / diverse
and rebou^dable / is the tune of this world / as of an harp / nor in mortal
things / is there any thing that is pure / clear / and simple. But as musyke
stands by hye and low soundes / and gra^mer by letters / vowels and mutes /
and that he is not a musycien or a gramarien / whom eitherlyke of these does
offend / but he that can use them and temper the^ most accordingly / no
notherwise it seems / that he wisely has stablished his life / that most
diverse chances contrary among the^ self / has learned to mi^gle hansomly /
wayeng prosperity with aduersite. for clearly to set aparte / good or ill /
mortal comodite will not suffer / but it behooves to make a temper with both /
if we will determyn right of these things. It is not therefore according / in
the tone of these to plain / and faynting in the mind / to fall down as it
were under to heavy a burden / but the power and thi^pression of every worst
chance / to repulse with the remembrance of better things / always wrappi^g
up discomodites in comodites / as it were in a napkyn / to make the tenor of
the hole life / made and gadered with prosperites and aduersytes / as a
certain accord / te^pred with connyng reason. And truly / not as Menander
thought / a man has as soon as he is borne / a good spirit / as begynner of
his life and techer of right lyueng / but rather as Empedocles thought / two
spyrites of diverse condition / to who^ he gives diverse and many names does
receive us as soon as we come i^ to the light / from thensforth given unto the^
/ as it were almost by right of service. He said that our generation did
receive the seeds of al these affections / and that therefore the draught of
our life was not even and level / but rather brackish and sower / and therefore
the wise man should have the best things in his desire / and look for the worst
/ and in the te^per of the^ both use of neither perte to much. Nor yet shall
he come plesantly to to morrow / as Epicurus says / that with great debatyng
douteth whyder he shall live to it / but riches / glory / power / and authorite
/ gladeth and reioyseth such men most / that with contrary things a totherside
/ if case happen / can be as good and as upright. For truly vehement appetit of
any thing / has always fere his fellow of lesi^g it / that dulleth the gladness /
and makes it more to be desired / as wha^ flame is resisted with great wind. who^
truly reason has taught assuredly and vnferfully thus to say to fortun / if
thou give it I shall be rizt glad / if thou take it again / I shall be indifferent.
this man that can thus use hi^ self / without marueyle / must needs use things
that happen plesantly / and not be pulled from thens with fear of that loss
rennynge in the thought. Anaxagoras when he herd that his son was deed / I
knew quod he / when I begote hi^ that he should dye / and I have suffered over
that awayti^g. this affection of Anaxagoras / is asmoch to be followed of us /
as wo^dred at. Surely we may stay forthwt each misfortun / I knew I had slypy
riches / not nailed with six penny nayl / as they say in my possession / and
that I had them / but to use the^. I knew well enough that they that gave me
power / might also take it from me. I knew that my wife was wise / but that
she was also a woman ^ and for the last I knew that my friend was a man / that
is to say / a lively thing ready of nature to be depraved / as Plato often said.
Truly he that compares thus the reasons of his affections / and byldeth him
such ra^pers of reason / if ought happen other wise than he would / or
ouerthwartly / yet is it not to him sodayn / and where as he never admits
those common thi^ges^ I would never have went it / I was i^ great hope / I
never thought it would be thus / there truly does he fordo the vneuynnesse of
a stertynge or glytteriug heart / and of one that was troubled and meued / he
makes forwith to him self / one pesable and constant. Carneades was wont to
warn men most in prosperity of aduersite / for that every sudden things
nature is to be received all with grutchynge of the mind / and as a manner
meltyng. How great aparte is now Macedony / of the romayn Empire? yet Perses
when he lost it / not only accused fortune with foul complayntes / but seemed
also to diverse / most unfortunate and wretched of all men. Look on the other side
/ Emilius when he had ouercom him / partyng from the country / gyueng place in
the lordship of the sea and of the land to the right successor / was received
with the garlandes / and reioysynges of all men / and in the sacrifice extolled
unto heaven with praises / and not undeserved / but most deserved. For he
remembered him self to have gotten a chaunceable kingdom / the to thereby
vnwened and vnforthought chance was put from the height of his kingdom. Me
thi^keth Homer techeth with a proper example / how much more hurtful those
things are that stryke suddenly. Uli^es at his return home / wept at the
sodeyne death of his dog / and not to his wife that sat by him and wept. for
in coming / consydringe the weeping image of his wife / he had subdued the
affection that else now would have broken out / and by former shittyng of the
mi^de / had reduced it in to his own power / and was troubled with the
vnforethought death of the dog / for that in the sodeyn thing he had no space
/ to let the power of his affection. to conclude shortly / things that chance
against our minds / ar scant and herdly suffered / partly by nature / and
partly we se they ar grievous / by corrupt custom and naughty opinion / and
they be the most part. it is of great effect against the^ / to have at hand
this sentence of Mena^der. Thou have suffered no great grefe / onles thou make it
so thy self / for what touches it the / if it another streyne thy flessh / nor
reche to thy soul / as by example / thunnoblenesse of thy father / the adultry
of thy mother / the dignite of the first place taken from the / the reward of
thy victory bereft the / what perteyn these things to the? for truly tho
these things happen / it should not let the in thy body nor in thy mind to be
well / ye and right well. Against these things that by nature does so^thing
offend / as siknesses / hurtes / and dethis of kinsfolk / this must be set.
alas / wherefore alas? for we have suffered nothing / that perteyneth not to man
to suffer. For there is no speech that sooner rebukes thaffectionate perte of
the mind / wha^ it is drawn ouertwhartly with affections / and when it
snatcheth the byt of reason i^ the teth / tha^ that that warns us of our comen
and natural necessites / unto which necessite man is borue / and entangled as
the body grows / which shall give unto stryuing fortune / a knot / sure of
all other things / that are most chief and grettest. They say Demetrius when he
sacked the town of Megare^sis^ asked of Stylpo if any of his go^des was taken
from him? to whom he answered. I saw no body take away mine / for where as
fortune has suffered / all her things to be taken from her / yet have we no
such things i^ us / as another the greeks ca^ do nor suffer. it is not therefore
mete so much to forsak nature / as having no strength nor sufferau^ce / to
match fortunes violence. where as we know rightwell / that that / that i^ man
may be hurt with fortune / is but a little / and the worst part of us frail
and overthrown with every impression / by deynte tenderness / and that we our
self have the power over the better parts / wherein be set those grettest and
good things / as in an vnslypper place / and where also true glory / lerui^ges
/ and studys pertayni^g to vtue have their being / another mortal nor
byreueable by no strength. thus I say / knowi^g our selfs of vnuyncible mi^de
/ for trusti^g to our selfs / it becomes us to be assured again things to
come / and to say that to fortune / that Socrates fayni^g did say by Auitus
and Melitus his accusers / truly quod he / to the iuges Auytus and Melitus may
slay me / but to do me hurt or displeasure / they can not. for tho fortune
might overthrow him with diverse sicknesses / take from him his riches or accuse
him to a tyrant / or to the people / yet might she not truly make him ill / or
faint herted / or fearful / or altered of his mind / or else make him malicyous
/ but only a good man / endued with manlynesse and courage of the mind / and
at a word she might not bereue him the right order of the mind / which
truly profits more to man / for the ledyng of the life / than the craft of
sailing / for to pass the sees. For the maryner be he never so co^ning / can
not by any means redress the fury of the water / nor repulse the assaut of
the feirce wind / no more than get a haven where he would / when so ever he
would return from the sea. No / nor this comes not to him by craft that when
he is taken with tempest / constantly and vnferfully to handle the necessite /
herto it helph not / that whilst he dispayreth not / for place for his craft /
taking i^ the sail / drives as he may with the tempest / the coward now
sits down with wri^ging hands from all this ge^e / and while the mast is
drowned with force of wind / he shakes with tre^bling fere. but in a wise man
/ an ordered mi^de with the body bri^geth fair wether / that is to say with
contynence / and tempre of fode and labor / wipyng away the causes of
sickness / and if there be any outward cause of trouble / in the which a
man's mind is ron / as i^ the roky fla^tes / with quick pulling up the sail
yard (as Asclepiades says) it passes over. And if so be it en^rese and grow
more than can be socourd or suffered by man / the haven is not fer of / and
there rests to the to swym out of the body / as out of the ship boot / when
it will hold no more. Truly foles / not so much for the desire of life / as
for the fear of death / hangi^g on the body cleue fast with claspyng hands /
no notherwise than Ulixes did ha^g on the wild fig tree / when he feared the
russhing of the horelpole Caribdis / whom Homer says / was so nere taken in
the sea of Sycill / that he coud another stop by reason of the wind that
shoued him / nor yet get out / so did that let him / and as tho he held the
wolf by the eres / as the proverb says / coud another hold the ire / for
werynesse and discomodite of the chance / nor let it go for fere of the
dreadful pyll. But if any ma^neuer so little consider / the nature of our soul
/ and does reckon with him self / the passage from the state of this life to
be to a better / or at the lest to no worse / by death truly he has already / no
little forderaunce for his journey / that is to say / the contempt of death.
For who that / what with valiant virtue / which is the properte and
peculyarite of man / and what with ordri^g assuredly the mind / against for
rain and strange things / which come beside nature / mightily to overthrow
our proper things / may live so plesa^tly / that he may say / I may go / I may
go my way surely at the first tym / with the good leave of god / when I will /
when I pray the / other grievous or co^brous / or troublous thing can happen
unto him? Of troth / what soever he is that says this word / I have
prevented the / o fortune / and all thy entres were they never so streyte I
have stopte / this man not with berres / nor nails / nor byldinges has coraged
and stre^gthed him self / but rather with decrees of philosophy / and rules of
wisemen / which also be open and so ready for every man / that they need but
only the taking. Nor we may not take away believe in those things / that have been left to our remembrance of our elders / nor dispeyre in nothing of the^ /
as tho they were not possible to be folowd / but as it is mete to look upon
them / and to marueyle much of them / as it were by grace wondringe of them /
so must we make our selfs / by confyrmynge us to their following lyklihodes of
them / that by beginnings set in small things / as saying gretter and gretter
/ we may profit to the highest. But we must diligently look / that we put not
the thoughts of these things out of our mind / nor that we let to turn often
these things in our thought / and (as they say) to think on them with all our
heart. Nor this business ends no great labor (for as a certain swetnesse of
the mind / noyeth us and has taught us with slouthful and unexercised
tenderness / and hauntynge most prone things of lest business / by an
naughty favor has taught it self / out of vndelightsome things / to turn
it self to each pleasant thing / so lykwise if any man use to feign in his mind
/ the images of sickness / of labor / of exyle / and to gader unto him the
stre^gthes of his reason / to discus diligently each by him self. this man /
this / s^all without fail se that those things / for the most part / ar vayn
and dispi^able / that seem heavy / ferefull / and horrible / and to say troth /
threten more with their look / than they do in the departing But many abhor
that word of Menander / that any man a live may not glory / in ^ayeng / this
I will not suffer. for that they know not what it aueyleth for to avoid
heuines / to think and to use to behold fortune / with vnagreable and f^irs
eyes / and not to le^e to tender thoughts / and trifling delytes / and
norisshmentes of esy life / rysyng at every little hope / and falling at every
little thing. Although it may be thus answered to Menander. It can no wyse^e said
/ why^e I live this I will not suffer / let it be so / but this I may say
while I live / this I will not do / I will not lie / I will use no crafty
deceites for to compass men / I will not begyle / I will not disceitfully lie
in an ayte. this syns it is in us / it is a great help to the^ that lift them
self up to the surety of mind / in which manner like as botches be in the body
/ so is a naughty conscience in the soul / as that that leueth repentance /
busely prickyng and pulling the mi^de. For where all other heuinesses ar wont
to be taken away by reason / only this repentance it self provoke by shame
/ as one that byte^h and gnaweth him self. And truly / as they that shake of a
cold ague / or burn of an hot ague / ar more sharply and fervently vexed tha^
they that suffer the same things / of vtwarde cold or hete. so casual and
chau^ceable things / have more blunter heuynesses / as outward and foreign
things. And this thing / no body is to blame for me but my self / which is
wont to be plainynly cried / when an offense is done / makes the hurt tha^
(...) grievous of it self / more grievous / and drives it in deper. So nouther
gorgiousnesse of buylding / nor weight of gold / nor nobleness of kyn / nor
greatness of empire / nor eloquence and fair spekyng / brinketh so much
clerenesse of life / and so pleasant quietness / as brings a mind discovered
from trouble of business / lyueng (as they say) with him self far from ill
advise. which having the well of life (I mean ^yt and conditions / from which
commendable deeds do spri^g) clear and untroubled / shall bring forth all his
deeds / merry and upright as it were with an heavenly grace / by the remembrance
whereof / he is feed with a more certain / than Pyndarus hope / norishme^t (as
he says) of old age. And as Carneades was wont to say / the sweet fyrres tho
they be cut or pulled up by the rotes / they keep a sweet savor a long
while / truly in the mind of a wise man / honest deeds do ever leave a certain
fresshe and plesaunt remembrance. with the which remembrance that same
inward gladness springs by a co^tynuall river / as who says bering fruit
/ to the great shame of their error / that so lame^tably blame this life /
saying it is a congregation of ylles / and a certain resort of outlawes / in to
the which only the souls that be banyshed from above be put. I reken that
word of Diogines worthy remembrance / which he said / when he saw a
stranger in Lacedemona / curiously pyking him self again a holyday. what quod
he / is not every day holyday with a good man? yes and if we be wise most
gladsom holiday. For this world is a certain most holy temple / and most mete
for god / in to this temple man is admytted when he is borne / not to be hold
karuyn images wantyng senses / but the son / the moon / and the sterres / from
which comes mouyng / and the first principles of life / which providence
has given unto us to behold / that they should be sensyble images and
folowynges of intelligible things / as Plato says. be sides these / the
flodes that bring forth always new waters / and the earth producyng fode /
both unto trees and unto all kind of bestes. with this goodlynesse and
prospecte beginning truly our life / it must be full of surety and of
ouerspred gladso^nesse / nor (...) ar not to be looked for of us / Saturn^^
festes / or Bacchus festes / or Myneruas festes / as many do that receive these
and such other festes with great awayti^ge / gladsomnesse and sport / in
which they may more lyberally / glad them self with bought laughter gyueng
wages unto mynstrels and tomblers for their mind sake. And what is more
uncomely / than that in such plays we sit with such pertynax s^ylence doyn^
nothing else (as they say) (for there is no man that lame^teth or wepeth / wha^
he seith Pythia begin / no more than he is hu^gry after the feast) and those
goodlynesses whereof god him self is auctor unto us / and in manner player /
with lame^tyng and sowernesse of mind / ledyng a dolorous life / we defile and
make soro^full. And yet most vnsely is this / when we delight in orgaynes played
and sounded / and in little birds songs / and behold gladly the beestes
playng and dau^syng / and again ar offended with their froward noise and
their cruel lokes / yet nevertheless seeing our own lives sad and heavy /
frownyng / and overthrown with most troublous affections and tangled
busynesse^ and cures / and driven with vntempe^^^esse / that not only we can
not get us some lyberte and space to take our brethe / but another here also
other exhortyng us to it. To whose warnynges with clear and opyn cares / if we
would give head / we should use things present as they come without any blame
/ and should rest with the plesaunt remembrance of things past / and at the
