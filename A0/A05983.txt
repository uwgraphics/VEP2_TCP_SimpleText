An Act for the uniformity of Common prayer, and service in the Church, and
administration of the Sacraments.
WHere at the death of our late Sovereign Lord King Edward the sixth, there
remained one uniform order of Common Service and prayer, and of the
administration of Sacraments, Rites, and Ceremonies in the Church of England
which was set forth in one book, entitled, The book of Common prayer, and
administration of Sacraments, and other Rites and Ceremonies in the Church of
England, authorized by Act of Parliament, holden in the fifth and sixth years
of our said late Sovereign Lord king Edward the sixth, entitled, An Act for
the uniformity of Common prayer, and administration of the Sacraments: the
which was repeated and taken away by Act of Parliament, in the first year of
the reign of our late Sovereign Lady Queen Mary, to the great decay of the
due honor of God, and discomfort to the professors of the truth of Christ's
Religion.

Be it therefore enacted by the authority of this present Parliament, that
the said Statute of repeal, and every thing therein contained, only
concerning the said Book, and the Service, administration of Sacraments.
Rites and Ceremonies, contained or appointed in, or by the said Book, shall be
void and of none effect, from and after the feast of the Nativity of S John
Baptist next coming. And that the said Book with the order of Service, and
of the administration of Sacraments, Rites, and Ceremonies, with the alteration
and additions therein added, and appointed by this Statute, shall stand, and be
from and after the said feast of the Nativity of S. John Baptist, in full
force and effect, according to the tenor and effect of this Statute: any thing
in the aforesaid Statute of repeal to the contrary, not withstanding.

And further be it enacted by the Queen Highness, with the assent of the
Lords and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority
of the same, that all and singular Ministers, in any Cathedral or Parish
Church, or other place within this Realm of England, Wales, and the Marches of
the same, or other the Queens dominions, shall from and after the feast of the
Nativity of Saint John Baptist next coming, be bounden to say and use the
Mattens, Euensong, celebration of the Lords Supper, and administration of each
of the Sacraments, and all other Common and open prayer, in such order and
form as is mentioned in the said Book, so authorized by Parliament in the
said fifth and sixth year of the reign of King Edward the sixth, with one
alteration or addition of certain Lessons to be used on every Sunday in the
year, and the form of the Letanie altered and corrected, and two sentences
only added in the delivery of the Sacrament to the communicants, and none
other, or otherwise. And that if any manner of Parson, Vicar, or other
whatsoever Minister, that ought or should sing or say Common Prayer mentioned
in the said Book, or minister the Sacraments, from and after the feast of the
nativity of S. John Baptist next coming, refuse to use the said Common
Prayers, or to minister the Sacraments in such Cathedral or Parish Church, or
other places, as he should use to minister the same, in such order and form
as they be mentioned and set forth in the said Book, or shall wilfully or
obstinately standing in the same, use any other Rite, Ceremony, Order, Form,
or manner of celebrating of the Lords Supper openly or privily, or Mattens,
Euensong, administration of the Sacraments, or other open Prayers, then is
mentioned and set forth in the said Book (Open prayer in and throughout this
Act, is meant that Prayer which is for other to come unto or hear, either in
common Churches, or private Chapels, or Oratories, commonly called the Service
of the Church) or shall preach, declare, or speak any thing in the derogation,
or deprauing of the said Book, or any thing therein contained, or of any part
thereof, and shall be thereof lawfully contuicted, according to the Laws of
this Realm, by verdict of twelve men, or by his own confession, or by the
notorious evidence of the fact: shall lose and forfaite to the Queens
highness, her heirs and successors, for his first ofience, the profit of
all his Spiritual Benefices or promotions, coming or arising in one whole
year next after his conviction: And also that the person so convicted, shall
for the same offense suffer imprisonment by the space of six months, without
Bail or maineprise. And if any such person, once convict of any offense
concerning the premises, shall after his first conviction eftsoons offend,
and be thereof in form aforesaid lawfully convict: that then the same
person shall for his second offense suffer imprisonment by the space of one
whole year, and also shall therefore be deprived ipso facto of all his
Spiritual promotions. And that it shall be lawful to all Patrons or Donours
of all and singular the same Spiritual promotions, or of any of them, to
present or collate to the same, as though the person or persons so offending
were dead. And that if any such person or persons, after he shall be twice
convicted in form aforesaid, shall offend against any of the premises the
third time, and shall be thereof in form aforesaid lawfully convicted: that
then the person so offending, and convicted the third time, shall be deprived
ipso facto of all his Spiritual promotions, and also shall suffer imprisonment
during his life.

And if the person that shall offend and be convict in form aforesaid,
concerning any of the premises, shall not be beneficed, nor have any
Spitituall promotion: that then the same person so offending and convict, shall
for the first offense suffer imprisomnent during one whole year next after his
said conviction, without bail or maineprise. And if any such person not having
any Spiritual promotion, after his first conviction, shall eftsoons offend
in any thing concerning the premises, and shall in form aforesaid be thereof
lawfully convicted: that then the same person shall for his second offense
suffer imprisonment during his life.

And it is ordained and enacted by the authority abouesaide, that if any
person or persons whatsoever, after the said feast of the Nativity of Sanit
John Baptist next coming, shall in any Enterludes, Plays, Songs, Rimes, or by

despising of the same Book, or of any thing therein contained, or any part
thereof, or shall by open fact, deed, or by open threatenings, compel, or
cause, or otherwise procure, or maintain any Parson, Vicar, or other Minister,
in any Cathedral or Parish Church, or in Chapel, or in any other place, to

or in any other manner and form then is mentioned in the said book, or that by
any of the said means, shall unlawfully interrupt or let any Parson, Vicar,
or other Minister, in any Cathedral or Parish Church, Chapel, or any other
place, to sing or say Common and open Prayer, or to minister the Sacraments, or
any of them, in such manner and form as is mentioned in the said Book: that
then every such person being thereof lawfully convicted in form abouesayde,
shall forfeite to the Queen our Sovereign Lady, her heirs, and successors,
for the first offense an hundredth marks. And if any person or persons, being
once convict of any such offense, estsoones offend against any of the last

said sum, suffer imprisonment during twelve months, without bail or
maineprise. And that from and after the said feast of the Nativity of Saint

The Preface.
THere was never any thing by the wit of man so well devised, or so sure
established, which in continuance of time has not bin corrupted: as among
other things, it may plainly appear by the common prayers in the Church,
commonly called Divine Service. The first original and ground whereof, if a
man would search out by the ancient Fathers, he shall find that the same was
not ordained but of a good purpose, and for a great advancement of godliness.
For they soordered the matter, that all the whole Bible (or the greatest part
thereof) should be read over once every year, entending thereby that the
Clergy, and specially such as were ministers of the Congregation, should (by
often reading and meditation of Gods word) be stirred up to godliness
themselves, and be more able to exhort other by wholesome doctrine, and to
confute them that were aduersarics to the truth. And further, that the people
(by daily hearing of holy Scripture read in the Church) should continually
profit more and more in the knowledge of God, and be the more inslamed with
the love of his true religion. But these many years passed, this godly and
decent order of the ancient Fathers has been so altered, broken, and
neglected, by planting in uncertain stories, Legends, Responds, Verses, vain
Repetitions, Co^memorations, and Synodalles, that commonly when any book of
the Bible was begun, before three or four chapters were read out, all the rest
were unread. And in this sort the book of Esaias was begun in Aduent, and the
book of Genesis in Septuagesima: but they were only begun, and never read
through. After like sort were other books of holy Scripture used. And
moreover, whereas Saint Paul would have such language spoken to the people in
the Church, as they might understand, and have profit by hearing the same: the
service in this Church of England, these many years, has bin read in Latin to
the people, which they understood not: so that they have heard with their cares
only, and their heart, spirit, and mind have not been edif;ied thereby. And
furthermore, not with slanding that the ancient Fathers have divided the
Psalms into seven portions, whereof every one was called a Nocturne: now of
late time a few of them have been daily said, and often repeated, and the rest
utterly omitted. Moreover, the number and hardness of the rules called the
Pie, and the manisold changings of the service, was the cause, that to turn
the book only was so hard and intricate a matter, that many times there was
more business to find out what should be read, then to read it when it was
found out.

These in conueniences therefore considered, here is set forth such an order,
where by the same shall be redressed. And for a readiness in this matter
hereis drawn out a Calendar for that purpose, which is plain and easy to be
understood, wherein (so much as may be) the reading of holy Scriptures is so
set forth, that all things shall be done in order, without breaking one piece
there of from an other. For this cause be cut off Anthemes, Responds,
Inuitatories, and such like things, as did break the continual course of the
reading of the Scripture. Yet because there is no remedy, but that of
necessity there must be some rules, therefore certain rules are here set
forth, which as they be sewe in number, so they be plain and easy to be
understood. So that here you have an order for prayer (as touching the
reading of holy Scripture) much agreeable to the mind and purpose of the old
fathers, and a great deal more profitable and commodious then that which of
late was used. It is more profitable, because here are left out many things,
whereof some be untrue some uncertain, some vain and superstitious, and is
ordained nothing to be read, but the very pure word of God, the holy Scriptures
or that which is evidently grounded upon the same, and that in such a language
and order, as is most easy and plain for the understanding both of the
readers and hearers. It is also more commodious, both for the shortness
thereof, and for the plainness of the order, and for that the rules be few
and casie. Furthermore by this order the Curates shall need none other books
for their public service, but this book and the Bible. By the means whereof,
the people shall not be at so great charges for books, as in times past they
have been.

And where here to fore there has been great diversity in saying and singing
in Churches within this Realm, some following Salisbury use, some Hereford
use, and somc the use of Bangor, some of York, some of Lincoln: Now from
henceforth all the whole Realm shall have but one use. And if any will judge
this way more painful, because that all things must be read upon the book,
where as before, by the reason of so often repetition they could say many
things by heart: if those men will weigh their labor, with the prosire and
knowledge which daily they shall obtain by reading upon the book, they will
not refuse the pain, in consideration of the great profit that shall ensue
thereof.

And forasmuch as nothing can almost be so plainly set forth, but doubts mary
life in the use and practicing of the same. To appease all such diversity (if
any arise) and for the resolution of all doubts concerning the manner how to
understand do, and execute the things contained in this Book: The parties that
so doubt, or diversely take any thing, shall always resort to the Bishop of the
Diocese, who by his diseretion shall rake order for the quieting and appeasing
of the same, so that the same order be not contrary to any thing contained in
this book. And if the Bishop of the Diocese be in any doubt, then he may send
for the resolution thereof unto the Archbishop.

Though it be appointed in the before written Presace, that all things shall
beread and sung in the Church in the English tongue, to the end that the
Congregation may be thereby edisied: yet it is not meant, but when men say
Morning and Evening prayer privately, they may say the same in any language
that they themselves do understand.

And all Priests and Deacons shall be bound to say daily the Morning and
Evening prayer, either privately or openly, except they be let by preaching,
studying of divinity, or by some other urgent cause.

And the Curate that ministers in every parish Church or Chapel being at
home, and not being otherwise reasonably let, shall say the same in the
Parish Church or Chapel where he ministers, and shall toll a bell thereto, a
convenient time before he begin, that such as be disposed, may come to hear
Gods word, and to pray with him.

Of Ceremonies, why some be abolished, and some retained
Of such Ceremonies as be used in the Church, and have had their beginning by
the inssitutio^ of man: some at the first were of godly intent and purpose
devised, and yet at length turned to vanity and superstition: some entered into
the Church by indiscreet devotion and such a zeal as was without knowledge,
and for because they were winked at in the beginning, they grew daily to more
and more abuses, which not only for their unprofitableness, but also because
they have much blinded the people, and obscured the glory of God, are worthy to
be cut a way, and clean rejected. Other there be, which although they have
been devised by man, yet it is thought good to reserve them still, as well for
and decent order in the Church (for the which they were first devised) as
because they pertain to edification, whereunto all things done in the Church
(as the Apostle teaches) ought to be referred. And although the keeping or
omitting of a Ceremony, in it self considered, is but a small thing: yet the
wilful and contemptuous transgression, and breaking of a common order and
discipline, is no small offense before God.

Let all things be done among you, faith S. Paul, in a seemly and due order.
The appointment of the which order, pertains not to private men: therefore no
man ought to take in hand, nor presume to appoint or alter any public or
common order in Christ's Church, except he be lawfully called and authorized
thereunto.

And where as in this our time, the minds of men are so diverse, that some
think it and great matter of conscience to depart from a piece of the least of
their ceremonies, they be so addicted to their old customs: and again on ye
other side, some be so new fangled, that they would innouate all things, and so
despise the old, that nothing can like the^ but that is new: it was thought
expedient, not so much to have respect how to please and satisfy either of
thief parties as how to please God, and profit them both. And yet lest any man
should be offended, who^ good reason might satisfy, here be certain causes
rendered, why some of the accustomed Ceremonies be put a way, and some retained
and kept still.

Some are put a way, because the great excess and multitude of them has so
increased in these latter days, that the burden of them was intolerable,
whereof S. Augustine in his time complained, that they were grown to such a
number, that the state of Christian people was in worse case, concerning that
matter, then were the Jews. And he counseled, that such yoke and burden
should be taken a way, as time would serve quietly to do it.

But what would S. Augustine have said, if he had seen ye ceremonies of late
days used among us whereunto ye multitude used in his time was not to be
compared, This our excessive multitude of Ceremonies. was so great, and many of
them so dark, that they did more confound and darken, then declare and set
forth Christ's benefits unto us

And besides this Christ's Gospel is not a ceremonial law (as much of Moses law
was) but it is a religion to serve Gob, not in bondage of the figure or shadow,
but in the freedom of the spirit, being content only with those ceremonies,
which do serve to a decent order, and godly disctpline, and such as be apt to
stir up the dull mind of man to the remcmbrauce of his duty to God, by some
notable and special signification, whereby he nught be edified.

Furthermore, the most waightr cause of the abolishment of certain ceremonies
was, that they were so far abused partly by the superstitious blindness of
the rude and unlearned, and partly by the insatiable avarice of such as sought
more their own lucre, then the glory of God, that the abuses could not well be
taken away, the thing remaining still. But now as concerning those persons,
which peradventure will be offended, for that some of the old Ceremonies, are
retained still: if they consider, that without some Ceremonies, it is not
possible to keep any order, or quiet disipline in the church, they shall easily
perceive just cause to reform their judgments. And if they think much that
nay of the old do remain, and would rather have all devised anew: Then such
men granting some Ceremonies convenient to be had, surely where the old may be
well used, there they cannot reasonably reprove the old, oncly for their age,
without bewraying of their own folly For in such a case, they ought rather to
have reverence unto them for their antiquity, if they willdeclare themseluse
to be more studious of unity and concord, then of innouations and
newfanglenesse, which (as much as m may be, with true setting forth of Christ's
religion) is always to be eschewed. Furthermore, such shall have no tust
cause with the Ceremonies reserved, be offended. For as those be taken away
which were most abused, and did burden men's conscrences wiyhout any cause: so
the other that remain are retained for a discipline and order, which (vponiust
causes) may be altered and changed, and therefore are not to be esteemed
equal with Gods Law. And moreover they be neither dark nor dumb ceremonies,
but are set forth, that every man may understand what they do mean, and to
what use they do serve. So that it is not like, that they in time to come,
should be abused as other have been. And in these our doing we condemn no
other nations nor prescribe any thing, but to our own people only. For we
think it convenient, thateuery country should use such Ceremonies, as they
shall think belt to the fetting forth of Gods honor and glory, and to the
reducing of the people to a most perfect and godly living, without error or
suoerstition: And that they should put a way other things, which from time to
time they perceive to be most abused, as in men's ordinances it often chances
diversely, in diverse countries.

The Table and Calendar expressing the order of the Psalms and Lessons to be
said at Morning and Evening prayer throughout the year, except certain proper
Feasts, as the rules following more plainly declare.
The order how the Psalter is appointed to he read.
THe Psalter shall be read through once every Month. And because that some
Monechs belonger then some other be, it is thought good to make them even by
this means.

To every Month shall be appointed (as concerning this purpose) just xxx. days.

And because January and Marchhaue one day above the said number, and February
which is placed between them both, has only xxviij. days: February shall
borow of either of the Months (of January and March) one day: And so the
Plalter which shall be read in February, must begin at the last day of January,
and end the first day of March.

And whereas May, July, August, October, and December have xxxj. days a piece:
It is ordered that the same Psalms shall be read the last day of the said
Months which were read the day before, so that the Psalter may begin again
the first day of the next Month ensuing.

Now to know what Psalms shall be read every day: Look in the calendar the
number that is appointed for the Psalms, and then find the same number in this
Table, and upon that number you shall see what Psalms shall be said at Morning
and Evening prayer.

And where the Cxix. Psalm is divided into 22. portions, and is ouerlong to be
read at one time: it is so ordered, that at one time shall not be read above
four or five of the said portions, as you shall perceive to be noted in this
Table following.

And here is also to be noted, that in this Table, and in all other parts of
the Service where any Psalms are appointed, the number is expressed after the
great English Bible, which from the ix. Psalm, unto the Cxlviij. Psalm
(following the division of the Hebrews) does vary in numbers from the common
Latin translation.

The Order how the rest of the holy Scripture (beside the Psalter) is appointed
to be read.
THe old Testament is appointed for the first Lessons at Morning and Evening
prayer, and shall be read through every year once, except certain Books and
Chapters, which be least edisying, and might best be spared, and therefore are
lest unread.

The New Testament is appointed for the second Lessons at Morning and Evening
prayer, and shall be read over orderly every year thrice, beside the Epistles
and Gospels except the Apocalypse, out of the which there be only certain
Lessons appointed upon diverse proper feasts.

And to know what Lessons shall be read every day, find the day of the month
in the Calendar following, and there ye shall perceive the Books and Chapters
that shall be read for the Lessons both at Morning and Evening prayer.

And here is to be noted, that when soener there be any proper Psalms or
Lessons appointed for the Sundays, or for any Feast, moveable or immovable:
then the Psalms and Lessons appointed in the Calendar, shall be omitted for
that time.

Ye must note also, that the Collect, Epistle and Gospel, appointed for the
Sunday, shall serve all the week after, except there sall some Feast that has
his proper.

When the years of our Lord may be divided into four even parts, which is
every fourth year: then the Sunday letter leapeth, and that year the Psalms
and Lessons which serve for the xxiij day of February, shall be read again the
day following, except it be Sunday, which has proper Lessons of the Old
Testament, appointed in the Table serving to that purpose.

Also wheresoever the beginning of any Lesson, Epistle, or Gospel is not
expressed, there ye must begin at the beginning of the Chapter.

And wheresoever is not expressed how far shall be read, there shall you
read to the end of the Chapter.

Item, so often as the first: Chapter of S. Matthew is read either for Lesson or
Gospel, ye shall begin the same at (The birth Jesus Christ was on this wife,
etc) And the third Chapter of S. Lukes Gospel, shall be read unto, So that he was
supoosed to be the son of Joseph etc.

Proper Lessons to be read for the first Lessons, both at Morning and Evening
prayer, on the Sundays throughout the year, and for some also the second
Lessons.

GOd be merciful unto us and us: Psalm.67.
and show us the light of his countenance, and be mertifull unto us.

That thy way may be known upon earth: thy saving health among all Nations.

Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise thee.

O let the Nations rejoice and be glad, for thou shall judge the folk
rigthteously: and govern the Nations upon earth.

Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.

Then shall the earth bring forth her increase: and God, even our own God,
shall give us his blessing.

God shall bless us: and all the ends of the world shall fear him.

After the Psalm, these Suffrages. The Lord be with you. Answer. And with thy
spirit. Let us pray. Lord have mercy upon us. Christ have mercy upon us. Lord
have mercy upon us. Our Father which art in heaven, etc.


Then shall follow three collects.

The first for the Kings Majesty.
OLorde our heavenly Father, high and mighties, King of Kings, Lord or Lords,
the only ruler of Princes, which do from thy Throune behold all the
dwellers upon earth, most heartily we beseech thee with thy favor to behold
our most gracious Sovereign Lord King James, and so replenish him with the
grace of thyholy Spirit, that he may always incline to thy will, and walk in
thy way: endue him plenteously with heavenly gists, grant him in health and
wealth long to live, strengthen him, that he may vanquish and overcome all his
enemies, and finally after thhis life he may attain everlasting joy and
felicity, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

The second Collect.
Almighty God, which by thy holy Prophet David art most truly said to stand
in the congregation of Princes, and give judgment in the midst of the
mighty men of the world, and through whose authority Princes do reign, Law
makers do discern just things, Lords bear rule, and all Judges of the earth
execute Judgment, and for that comes of thee all counsel and equity, all
understanding strength: Grant unto us here gathered together in thy Name, that
wiseeome which is always assistant to thy Seat, to give knowledge to our
feeble and ignorant minds. Send down (we beseech thee) the same wisdom out
of thy holy Heavens, and from the Throne of thy Majesty, that it may be now
with us, and labor with us, whereby we surely knowing what is acceptable unto
thee, may be led through it to the debating, weighing, and final determining
of those matters, by the which thy blessed Name may be glorified, thy
Catholic Church of england confirmed and increased, the Kings assurance
established, the common tranquillity of this Realm safely maintained, and last
of all, all estates and people thereof, in true obedience and charity united
and knit together. Grant this, O God, for thy only Sons sake Jesus Christ
our Lord. Amen.

The third Collect.
Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doing, with thy most Gracious favor, and
further us with thy continual help, that in all our works begun,
continued, and ended in thee, we may glorify thy holy Name, and finally by
thy mercy obtain Everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Then shall follow the Benediction, as thus.

THe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, 2. Cor. 13
and the love of God, and the fellowship of the holy Ghost, be with us all
evermore. Amen.

The order where Morning and Evening Prayer shall be used and said.
THE morning and Evening Prayer shall be used in the accustomed place of the
Church, Chapel, or Chancell, except it shall be otherwise determined by the
Ordinary of the place: And the chancels shall remain as they have done in
times past.

And here is to be noted, that the Minister at the time of the Communion, and
at all other times in his ministration, shall use such ornaments in the Church,
as were in use by authority of Parliament in the second year of the reign of
King Edward the sixth, according to the Act of Parliament set in the beginning
of this Book.

An order for Morning prayer daily throughout the year.
At the beginning both of Morning prayer, and like wise of Evening prayer, the
Minister shall read with a loud voice some one of these sentences of the
Scriptures that follow. And then he shall say that which is written after the
said sentences.

AT what time soever a sinner does repent him of his sin from the bottom of
this heart, I will put all his wickedness out of my remembrance, says the
Lord. Eze.xviij.


I do know mine own wickedness, and my sin is always against me. Psalm. Lj.


Turn thy face away from our sins (O Lord) and blot out all our offenses.
Psalm. Lj.


A sorrowful spirit is a sacrifice to God: despise not (O Lord) humble and
contrite hearts. Psalm. Lj.


Rent your hearts, and not your garments, and turn to the Lord your God,
because he is gentle and merciful, he is pacient, and of much mercy, and such
a one that is sorry for your afflictions. Joel ij.


To thee (O Lord God) belongs mercy and forgiveness, Dan^x.
for we have gone away from thee, and have not hearkened to thy voice, whereby
we might walk in thy Laws which thou have appointed for us.

Correct us (O Lord) and yet in thy judgment, not in thy fury, lest we should
be consumed and brought to nothing. (...) x.


Amend your lives, for the kingdom of God is at hand. Ma^h iij.


I will go to my father, and say to him, Father, I huve sinned against heaven,
and against thee: I am no more worthy to be called thy son. Luke xv.


Enter not into Judgment with thy servants, O Lord: for no flesh is righteous
in thy sight. Psalm exliij


If we say that we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and there is no
truth in us. i. John j.


Dearly beloved brethren, the scripture moves us in sundry places, to
acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness, and that we
should not dissemble nor cloak them before the face of Almighty God our
heavenly, Father, but confess them with an humble, lowly, penitent, and
obedient heart, to the end that we may obtain forgiveness of the same, vy
his infinite goodness and mercy. And although we ought at all times humbly to
acknowledge our sins before God: yet ought we most chiefly so to do, when
we assemble and meet together, to render thanks for the great benefits that
we have received at his hands, to set forth his most worthy praise, to hear
his most holy word, and to ask those things which be requisite and necessary,
as well for the body as the soul. Wherefore I pray and beseech you, as many as
be here present, to accompany me with a pure heart and humble voice, unto the
Throne of the heavenly grace, saying after me.

A general confession to be said of the whole Congregation after the Minister,
kneeling.

ALmighty and most merciful Father, we have erred and strayed from thy ways
like lost sheep, we have followed too much the devices and desires of our
own hearts, we have offended against thy holy Laws, we have left undone those
things which we ought to have done, and we have done those things which we
ought not to have done, and there is no health in us, but thou, O Lord, have
mercy upon us miserable offenders, spare thou them, O God, which confess,
their faults, restore thou them that be penitent, according to thy promises
unto mankind in Christ Jesus our Lord, and grant, O most merciful Father, for
his sake, that we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life, to the
glory of thy holy Name, Amen.

The absolution or remission of sins, to be pronounced by the Minister alone.

ALmighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which desires not the
death of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his wickedness and live,
and has given power and commandment to his Ministers, to declare and
pronounce to his people being penitent, the absolution and remission of their
sins: he pardons and absolueth all them which truly repent, and
unfeignedly believe his holy Gospel. Wherefore we beseech him to grant us true
repentance and his holy spirit, that those things may please him which we do
at this present, and that the rest of our life hereafter may be pure and holy,
so that at the last we may come to his eternallioy, through Jesus Christ our
Lord.

The people shall answer, Amen.

Then shall the Minister begin the Lords prayer with a loud voice.

OUr Father which art in heaven, hallowed ve thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will
be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And
forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass us. And lead us
not into temptation. But deliver us from evil. Amen.

Then likewise he shall say. O Lord open thou our lips. Answer. And our mouth
shall show forth thy praise. Priest. O God make speed to save us. Answer. O
Lord make haste to help us. Priest. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,
etc. As it was in the beginning, is now, etc. Praise ye the Lord.


Then shall be said or sung this Psalm following.

O Come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us heartily rejoice in ye strength of
our salution. Veni^e exul(...)


Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving:and show our selves glad in
him with Psalms.

For the Lord is a great God: and a great King avoue all gods.

In his hand are all the corners of the earth: and the strength of the hills
is his also.

The Sea is his, and he made it: and his hands prepared the dry land.

O come, let us worship, and fall down: and kneel before the Lord our maker.

For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture, and the
sheep of his hands.

To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: as in the
provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness.

When your fathers tempted me: proved me, and saw my works.

Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: it is a
people that do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways.

Unto whom I swear in my wrath: that they should not enter into my rest.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the holy Ghost.

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without and,
Amen.

Then shall follow eertaine Psalms in order, as they be appointed in a table
made for that purpose, except there be proper Psalms appointed for that day.
And at the end of every Psalm throughout the year, and likewise in the end of
Benedictus, Benedicite, Magnisicat, and Nunc dimittis, shall be repeated, Glory
be to the Father, etc, As it was in the, etc.

Then shall be read two Lessons distinctly with a loud voice, that the people
may hear. The first, of the old Testament. The second of the New, like as they
be appointed in the Calendar, except there be proper Lessons assigned for that
day: the Minister that reads the Lesson, standing, and turning him so, as he
may best beheard of all such as be present. And before every Lesson, the
Minister shall say thus, The first, second, third, or fourth Chapter of
Genesis, or Exodus, Matthew, Mark, or other like, as is appointed in the
Calendar. And in the end of every Chapter he shall say, Here ends such a
Chapter of such and book.

And to the end the people may the better hear in such places where they do
sing, there shall the Lessons be song in a plain tune, after the manner of
distinct reading: and likewise the Epistle and Gospel.

After the first Lesson, shall follow Te Deum laudamus in English, daily
throughout the whole year.

WE praise thee, O God: we knowledge thee to be the Lord. Te Deum laudamus


All the earth does worship thee: the Father euerlasring.

To thee all Angelscry alowd: the heavens, and all the powers therein.

To thee Cherubin, and Seraphin: continually do cry.

Holy, holy, holy: Lord God of Sabbath.

Heaven and earth are full of the Majesty: of thy glory.

The glorious company of the Apostles: praise thee.

The goodly fellowship of the Prophets: praise thee.

The noble army of Martyrs: praise thee.

The holy Church throughout all the world: does knowledge thee.

The Father: of an infinite Majesty.

Thine honorable: true, and only Son.

Also the holy Ghost: the Comforter.

Thou art the King of glory: O Christ.

Thou art the everlasting Son: of the Father.

When thou tookest upon thee to deliver man: thou did not abhor the
Virgins womb.

When thou had overcome the sharpness of death: thou did open the
kingdom of heaven to all believers.

Thou sittesst at the right hand of God: in the glory of the Father.

We believe that thou shall come: to be our Judge.

We therefore pray thee help thy servants: whom thou have redeemed with thy
prerious blood.

Make them to be numbered with thy Saints: in glory everlasting.

O Lord save thy people: and bless thine heritage.

Govern them: and lift them up for ever.

Day by day: we magnify thee.

And we worship thy Name: ever world without end.

Vouchsafe (O Lord:) to keep us this day without sin.

do proceed: give unto thy servants that both our hearts may world cannot

The third Collect for aid against all perils.

our Savior Jesus Christ, Amen.

In then feasts of Christmas, the Epiphanie, Saint Matthie, Easter, the
Ascension, Pentecost, Saint John Baptist, Saint lames, Saint Bartholomew, Saint
Matthew, Saint Simon and Jude, Saint Andrew, and Trinity Sunday, shall be sung or
said, immediately after Benedictus, this confession of our Christian faith.

Quicunque vult.
Whosoever will be saved: before all things it is necessary that he hold the
Catholic faith. Quicunque vult.


Which faith, except every one do keep holy and bndefiled: without doubt he
shall perish everlastingly.

And the Catholic faith is this: that we worship one God in trinity, and
trinity in unity.

Neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance.

For there is one person of ye Father, another of the Son: and another of the
holy Ghost.

But the godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the holy Ghost, is all
one:the glory equal, the majesty coeternall.

Such as the Father is, such is the Son:and such is the holy Ghost.

The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate:and the holy Ghost uncreate.

The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible: and the holy Ghost
incomprehensible.

The Father eternal, the Son eternal:and the holy Ghost eternal.

And yet they are not three eternals:but one eternal.

As also there be not three incomprehensibles, nor three uncreated: but one
vucreated, and one incomprehensible.

So like wise the Father is almighty, the Son almighty: and the holy Ghost
almighty.

And yet they are not three almighties:but one almighty.

So the Father is God, the Son is God: and the holy Ghost is God.

And yet they are not three Gods:but one God.

So like wise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord:and the holy Ghost Lord.

And yet not three Lords:but one Lord.

For like as we be compelled by the Christian verity:to acknowledge every
person by himself to be God and Lord.

So are we forbidden by the Catholic Religion: to say there be three Gods,
or three Lords.

The Father is made of none: neither created, nor begotten.

The Son is of the Father alone: not made, nor created, but begotten.

The holy Ghost is of the Father, and of the son:neither made, nor created,
nor begotten, but proceeding.

So three is one Father, not three fathers, one Son, not three sons:one
holy Ghost, not three holy ghost.

And in this Trinity, none is before or after other: none is greater or less
then another.

But the whole three persons be coeternall together: and cocquall.

So that in all things, as is aforesaid: the Unity in Trinitic, and the
Trintie in Unity is to be worshipped.

He therefore that will be saved: must thus think of the Trinity.

Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation: that he also believe
rigthtly in the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.

For the right faith is, that we believe and confess: that our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, is God and man.

God, of the substance of the father, begotten before the worlds: and man, of
the substance of his mother, borne in the world.

Perfect God, and perfect man: of a reasonable soul, and humane flesh
subsisting.

Equal to the Father as touching his godhead: and inferior to the Father,
touching his manhood.

Who although he be God and man: yet he is not two, but one Christ.

One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh: but by taking of the manhood
into God.

One altogether, not by confusion of substance: but by unity of person.

For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man:so God and man is one Christ.

Who suffered for our salvation: descended into hell, rose again the third day
from the dead.

He ascended into heaven, he sits on the right hand of the Father, God
Almighty: from whence he shalll come to judge the quick and the dead.

At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies: and shall give
account for their own works.

And they that have done good, shall go into life everlasting: and they that
have done evil into everlasting fire.

This is the Catholic faith: which except a man believe faithfully, he cannot
be saved.

Glory be to the Fathet, and to the Son, amp;c.

As it was in the beginning, is now, etc.

Thus endcth the order of Morning and Evening prayer throughout thewhole year.

Here follows the Letanie, to be used upon Sundays, Wednesdayes, and
Fridayes, and at other times when it shall be commanded by the Ordinary.
O God the Father of heaven: have mercy upon us iniscrable sinners.

O Almighty God, which art a strong tower of defense unto thy servants against
the face of their enemies: we yield thee praise and thanksgiving for our
deliverance from those great and apparent dangers, wherewith we were compassed:
We acknowledge it thy goodness, that we were not delivered over a pray unto
them, beseeching thee still to continue such thy mercies to wards us, that all
the world may know, that though art our Savior and Mighty deliverer, through
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

A thanksgiving for deliverance from the Plague.
O Lord God, which have wounded us for our sins, and consumed us for our
transgressions by thy late heavy and dreadful visitation, and now in the
midst of judgment remenibring mercy, fast redeemed our souls from the
jaws of death, we offer unto thy fatherly goodness our selves, our souls,
and bodies, which thou have delivered, to be a living sacrifice unto thee,
always praising and magnifying thy mercies in the midst of the Congregation,
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Or this.

We humbly acknowledge before thee, (O most merciful Father) that all the
punishments which are threatened in thy Law, might iussly have fallen upon us,
by reason of our manifold transgressions and hardness of heart: yet feeing it
has pleased thee of thy tender mercy, upon our weak and unworthy humiliation
to assuage the noisome pestilence, wherewith we lately have been sore afflicted,
and to restore the voice of joy and health into our dwellings: we offer unto
thy divine Majesty thy sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, launding and
magnifying thy glorious Name for such thy preservation and providence over us,
through Jesus Christ Lord. Amen.

The Collects, Epistles and Gospels, to be used at the celebration of the Lords
Supper and holy Communion through the year.
The first Sunday in Aduent.
The Collect.
ALmighty God, give us grace that We may cast away the works of darkness,
and put upon us the armor of light, now in the time of this mortal life (in
the which thy Son Jesus Christ came to visit us in great humility) that in
the last day when he shall come again in his glorious Majesty, to judge both
the quick and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal, through him who
tiueth and reigns with thee and the holy Ghost, now and ever. Amen.

The Epistle.
O we nothing to any man, Romans 13. 8.
but this, that ye love one another: For he that loves another, fulfilleth the
Law. For these Commandments, Thou shall not commit adultery, Thou shall not
kill, Thou shall not steal, Thou shall not bear false witness, Thou shall not
lust: and so forth (if there be any other Commandment) it is all comprehended
in this faying, namely, Love thy neighbor as thy self. Toue hurts not his
neighbor, therefore is love the fulfilling of the Law. This also we know the
season, how that it is time that we should now awake out of sleep: for now is
our salvation nearer then when we believed. The night is passed, the day is
come nigh: let us therefore cast away the deeds of darkness, and let us put
on the armor of light. Let us walk honestly, as it were in the day light, not
in eating and drinking, neither in chambering and wantonness, neither in
strife and envying: but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision
for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts of it.

The Gospel.
ANd when they drew nigh to Jerusalem, Mat. 21.1
and were come to Bethphage, unto mount Oliuet, then sent Jesus two of his
Disciples, saying unto them, Go into the town that lies over against you,
and anon ye shall find an Ass bound, and her colte with her, loose them,
and bring them unto me: and if any man say ought unto to you, say pee, The
Lord has need of them: and straight way he will let them go. All this was
done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet, saying, Tell
ye the daughter of Sion: behold, thy King comes unto thee, meek, sitting
upon an Ass, and a colte, the foale of the Ass used to the yoke. The
Disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them, and brought the Ass and the
colte, and put on them their clothes, and set him thereon. And many of the
people spread their garments in the way: other cut down branches from the
trees, and strawed them in the way. Moreover, the people that went before, and
they that came after, cried, saying, Hosanna to the some of David: Blessed is
he that conuneth in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest. And when
he was come to Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, who is this? And
the people said, This is Jesus the Prophet of Nazareth, a city of Galilee. And
Jesus went into the Temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought
in the Temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats
of them that sold doves, anb said unto them, It is written, My house shall be
called the house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves.

The second Sunday in Aduent.
The Collect.
BLessed Lord, which have caused all holy Scriptures to be written for
learning: Grant us that we may in such wise hear them, read, mark, learn,
and inwardly digest them, that by patience and comfort of thy holy word, we
may embrace and ever hold fast the blessed hope of everlasting life, which thou
have given us in our Savior Jesus Christ.

The Epistle.
Whatsoever things are written aforetime, Romans 15.4.
they are written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of
the Scriptures, might have hope. The God of patience and consolation, grant
you to be like minded one toward another, after the ensample of Christ Jesus:
that ye all agreeing together, may with one mouth praysse GOD the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore recciue ye one another, as Christ received
us, to the praise of God. And this I say, that Jesus Christ was a minister of
the Circunicision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the
fathers, and that the Gentiles might praise God for his mercy, as it is
written, For this cause I will praise thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto
thy Name. And again he says, Rejoice ye Gentiles with his people. And
again, Praise the Lord all ye Gentiles, and laud him all ye nations together.
And again Esai says, There shall be the root of Iesle, and he that shall rise
to reign over the Gentiles, in him shall the Gentiles trust. The god of hope
fill you with an joy and peace in believing, that ye may be rich in hope,
though the power of the holy Ghost.

The Gospel.
THere shall be signs in the Sun, Luke 21.25.
and in the Moon, and in the Stars: and in the earth the people shall be at
their wits and through despair. The Sea and the waters shall roar, and men's
hearts shall fail them for fear, and for looking after those things which
shall come on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall move. And then shall
mey ^ee the Son of man come in a cloud, With power and great glory. When
these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads, for
your redemption draws nigh. And he showed them a similitude: Behold the
sigge tree, and all other trees, when they shoot forth their buddes, ye see
and know of your own selves that Summer is then high at hand. So like wise ye
also (when ye see these things come to pass) be sure that the kingdom of God
is high. Verily I say unto you, this generation shall not pass, (...) all be
fulfilled, Heaven and earth shall pass, but my words shall not pass.

The third Sunday in Aduent.
The Collect.
LOrd, we beseech thee give our prayers, and by thy gracious vification lighten
the darkness of our hearts, by our Lord Jesus Christ.

The Epistle.
LEt a man this wise esteem us, (...). 4.1
even as the ministers of Christ, and Stewards of the secrets of God.
Furthermore, it is required of the stewards, that a man be found faithful.
With me it is but a very small thing that I should be judged of you, either of
man's judgment: No, I judge not mine own self, for I know naught by my self,
yet am I not thereby justified. It is the Lord that judges me. Therefore judge
nothing before the time, until the Lord come, which will lighten things that
are hid in darkness, and open the counsels of the hearts, and then shall every
man have praise of God.

The Gospel.
WHen John, being in prison, heard the works of Christ, March. 11.2.
he sent two of his disciples, and said unto him, Art thou he that shall come,
ord oe we look for anorther? Jesus answered, and said unto them, Go and show
John again what ye have heard and seen. The blind receive their sight, the
lame walk, the lepers are clensled, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised
up, and the poor receive the glad tidings of the Gospel: and happy is he that
is not offended by me. And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the
people concerning John, what went ye out into the wilderness to fee? Areede
that is shaken with the wind? Or what went ye out to see? A man clothed in
foft raiment: Behold, they that wear soft clothing, are in Kings house. But
what went ye out for to fee: A Prorhet: Verily I say unto you, and more then a
Prophet. For this is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger
before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

The fourth Sunday in Aduent.
The Collect.
Lord raise up (we pray thee) thy power, and come among us, and with great
might succor us, that whereas (through our sins and wickedness) we be sore
let and hindered, thy bountiful grace and merry (through the satisfaction of
thy Some our Lord) may speedily deliver us: to whom with thee and the holy
Ghost, be honor and glory world without end.

The Epistle.
Rejoice in the Lord always, Phil 4.4.
and again I say, rejoice. Let your softness be known to all men, the Lord
is even at hand. Be careful for nothing, but in all prayer and supplication,
let your petitions be manifest unto God, with giving of thanks. And the peace
of God (which passes all understanding) keep your hearts and minds, througt
Christ Jesus.

The Gospel.
This the record of John, John 1.19
when the Jews sent Priests and Levites from Jerusalem, to ask him, what art
thou? And he confessed, and denied not, and said plainly, I am not Christ.
And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he faith, I am not. Art thou
the Prophet? And he answered, No. Then said they unto him, what art thou, that
we may give an answer unto them that sent us? what say thou of thy sefe? He
said, I am the voice of a crier in the wilderness, Make straight the way of
the Lord, as said the Prophet Esai. And they which were sent were of the
Pharisees and they asked him, and said unto him, why baptizest thou then, if
thou be not Christ, nor Elias, neither that Prophet? John answered them,
saying, I baptize with water, but there stands one among you, whom ye know
not: he it is, which though he came after me, was before me, whose shoe
latchet I am not worthy to unloose. These things were done at Bethabara beyond
Iordane, were John did baptize.

Christmas day.
The Collect.
ALmighty God, which have given us thy only begotten Son, to take our nature
upon him, and this day to be borne of a pure virgin: Grant that we being
regenerate, and ma^e thy children by adoption and grace, may daily be renewed by
thy holy spitrit, through the same our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives and
reigns with thee, etc.

The Epistle.
GOD in times past, Heb.I.I.
diversely and many ways spoke unto the Fathers by Prophets: but in these last
days he has spoken to us by his own son, whom he has made heir of al
things, by whom also he made the world. Which son being the brightness of
his glory, and the vey image of his substance, ruling all things with the word
of his power, has by his own person purged our sins, and sits on the
right hand of the Majesty on high, being so much more excellent the^ the
Angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name then they. For
unto which of the Angels said he at any time, Thou art my son, this day have
I begotten thee? And agine, I will be his father, and he shall be my son.
And again, when he brings in the first begotten son into the world, he
says, And let all the Angels of God worship him. And unto the Angels he
faith, He maken his Angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire. But unto
the son he says, Thy feat (O God) shall be for ever and ever, the scepter
of thy kingdom is a right scepter: thou have loved righteousness, and hated
iniquity. Wherefore God, even thy God has anointed thee with the oil of
gladness above thy fellows. And thou Lord in the beginning have laid the
foundation the carch, and the heavens are the works of the hands: They shall
perish, but thou endurest. They all shall wax old as does agarment, and as a
vesture shall thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art even
the same, and thy years shall not fail.

The Gospel.
IN the beginning was the word, John I.I.
and the word was with God, and God was the word. The same was in the beginning
with God. Al things were made by it, and without it was made nothing yt was
made. In it was life, and the life was the light of men, and the light shines
in ye darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. There was sent from God a
man, whose name was John: the same came as a witness, to bear Witness of the
light, that all men through him might believe. He was not ye light, but was
sent to bear witness of the light. That light was the true light, which
lights every man that comes into the world. He was in the world, was made
by him, and the world knew him not. He came among his own, and his own
received him not. But as many as received him, to the^ gave he power to be made
sons of God, even them that believed on his Name, Which were borne, not of
blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor yet of the will of man, but of God. And
the same word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw the glory of it, as
the glory of the only begotten son of the Father, full of grace and truth.

Saint Steuens day.
The Collect.
Grant us, O Lord, to learn to love our enemies, by the example of thy martyr
S. Steven, who prayed for his persecuters, to thee which live, etc.

Then shall follow the Collect of the Nativity, which shall be said
continually unto Newyeeres day.

The Epistle.
ANd Steven being full of holy Ghost, A^. 7.55.
looked up steadfastly with his eyes into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and
Jesus standing on the right hand of God, and said, Behold, I see the heavens
open, and the Some of man standing on the right hand of God. Then they gave a
shoute with a loud voice, and stopped, their ears, and ran upon him all at
once, and cast him out of the city, and stoned him. And the witnesses laid
down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul: and they stoned
Steven, calling on, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. And he kneeled
down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.
And when he had thus spoken, he fell a sleep.

The Gospel.
BEhold, I send unto you Prophtes, Matt. 23.34.
and wise men and Scribes, and some of them ye shall kill and cruicfie, and some
of them ye shall scourg in your Synagogues, and persecute them from city to
city, that upon you may come all the righteous blood, which has been shed
upon the earth, from the blood of the righteous Abel, unto the blood of
Zacharias the son of Barachias, whom he slew between the temple and the
altar. Verily I say unto you, all these things shall come upon this generation.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killst the Prophets, and stonst them which
are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even
as the hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and ye would not? Behold,
your house is left unto you desolate. For I say unto you, ye shall not see me
henceforth, till that ye say, Blessed is he that comes in the Name of the
Lord.

Saint John Evangelists day.
The Collect.
Merciful Lord, we beseech thee to cast thy bright beams of light upon thy
Church, that it being lightened by the doctrine of thy blessed Apostle, and
Evangelist John, may attain to thy everlasting gifts, through Jesus Christ our
Lord.

The Epistle.
That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, i. loh.I I.
which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands
have handled of the word of life (And the life appeared, and we have seen and
bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father,
and appeared unto us) That which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you,
that ye also may have fellowship with us, and that our fellowship may be with
the Father and his son Jesus Christ. And this we write unto you, that ye may
rejoice, and that your joy may be full. And this is the tidings which we have
heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no
darkness at all. If we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in
darkness, we lie, and do not the truth. But and if we walk in light, even as
he is in light, then have we fellowship with him, and the blood of Jesus
Christ his son cleanses us from all sin. If we say we have no sin, we
deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us. If we knowladge our sins, he
is faithful and inst to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness. If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his
word is not in us.

The Gospel.
Jesus said unto Peter, Follow thou me. loh. ^i.i.^
Peter turned about, and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved, following (which
also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayth
thee?) when Peter therefore what saw him he said unto Jesus, Lord what shall
he here do? Jesus said unto him, If I will have him to tarry till I come, what
is that to thee? Follow thou me. The^ went this saying abroad among the
breathren, yt that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not to him, He
shall not die: but if I will that he tarry til I come, what is that to thee? The
same disciple is he which testifies of these things: and wrote these things,
and we know that his testimony is true. There are also many other things,
which Jesus did, the which if they should be written every one, I suppose the
world could not contain thc books that should be written.

Innocents day.
The Collect.
Almighty God, whole praise this day the young Innocents thy write have
confessed and showed forth not in speaking, but in dying: mortify and kill al
vices in us, that in our conversation, our life may express thy faith, which
with our tongues we do confess, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
I Looked, and lo, a lamb stood on the mount sion, Apo. 14.1.
and with him an hundredth and xliiii. thousand, having his name and his fathers
name written in their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heauenas the sound of
many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder. And I heard the voice of
harpers, harping with their harpes. And they sung as it were a new song before
the seat, and before the four beasts and the elders, and no man could learn
the soug, but the hundred and xliiii. thousand, which were redeemed from the
earth. These are they which were not defiled with woman, for they are birgins.
These follow the lamb, whether soever he goes. These were redeemed from men
being the first fruits unto God, and to the lamb, and in their mouths were
sound no guile: forthey are without spot before the throne of God.

The Gospel.
THe Angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a sleep, Mar. 2.13.
saying, Arise, and take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be
thou there till I bring thee word. For it will come to pass that Herod will
seek the child, to destroy him, So when he awoke, he took the child and
his mother by night, and departed into Egypt, and was there unto the death of
Herod, that it might be fufilled which was spoken of the Lord, by the Prophet,
saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son. Then Herod, when he saw that he
was mocked of the wife men. was erreeding worth and sent forth men of war,
and ^lew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts as
many as were two year old or under according to the time which he had
diligently known out of the wisem^e^. Then was fullfilled that which was
spoken by the Prophat Jeremy, where as he said, In Rama was there a voice
heard. lamentanon, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children,
and would not be comforted, because they were not.

The Sunday after Christmas day.
The collect.
Almighty God, and ( As upon Christmas day.)

The Epistle.
ANd I say, (...)
that the heir (as long as he is a child) differs not from a sernant,
though he be Lord of all, but is under tutours and governors, until the time
that the father has appointed. Even so we also, when we were children, were in
bondage under the ordinances of the world: But when the time was full come, God
sent his son made of a woman, and made bound unto the Law, to redeem them
which were bond unto to the Law, that we through election might receive the
inheritance that belongs unto the natural sons. Because year sons, God
has sent the spirit of his son into your hearts, which cries Abba, Father,
Werefore now thou art not a seurant, but a son, If thou be a son, thou art
also an heir of God through Christ.

The Gospel.
THis is the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David, Mat.
1.1.
the son of Abraham. Abraham begat Isahar: Isahar begat Jacob: Jacob begat
Judas this brethren: Judas begat Phares and Zaram, of Thamar: Phares begat
Esrom: Esrom begat Aram:Aram begat Aminabad: Aminadab begat Naasson: Naasson
begat Salmon: Salmon begat Boose of Rahab: Boos begat Obed of Ruth: Obed
begat Iesse: Iesse begat David the King: David the King begat Solomon of her
that was the wife of Vrie: Solomon begat Roboam: Roboam begat Abia: Abia
begat Asa: Asa begat Iosaphat: Iosaphat begat Ioram: Ioram begat Osias:
Osias begat Ioatham: Ioatham begat Achas: Achas begat Ezekias: Ezekias begat
Manasses: Manasses begat Amon: Amon begat Josias: Josias begat Iechonias and
his brethren, about the time that they were carried away to Babylon. And after
they were brought to Babylon, Iechomas begat Salathiel: Salathiel begat
Zorobabel: Zorobabel bell begat Abiud: Abiud begat Ehachim: Ehachim begat
Azor:: Azor begat Sador: Sador begat Achin: Achin begat Eliud: Eliud begat
Eleazar: Eleazar begat Matthan: Matthan begat Jacob: Jacob begat Ioleph the
husband of Marie, of whom was borne Jesus, even he that is called Christ And so
all the generations from Abraham to David, are xiiii. generations. And from
David unto the captivity of Babylon, are xiiii. generations. And from the
captivity of Babylon unto Christ, are xiiii. generations.

The birth of Jesus Christ was on this wife: when his mother Marie was married
to Joseph, (before they came to dwell together)she was founds with child by the
holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband, beacause he was arighteous man, and would
not put her to shame, was minded pruulie to depart from her. But while he thus
thought, behold, the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him in sleep, saying,
Joseph thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that
which is conceived in her, comes of tlIe holy Ghost. She shall bring forth a
son, and thou shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from
their sins.

All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by
the Prophet, sying, Behold, a maid shall be with child, and shall bring
forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel: which if a man
interpret, is as much to say, as God with us. And Joseph, as soon as he awoke
out of sleep, did as the Angel of the Lord had bidden him: and he cook his
wife unto him, and knew her not, till she had brought forth her first begotten
son, and called his name Jesus.

The Circumcision of Christ.
The Collect.
Almighty God, which made thy blessed son to be circumcised, and obedient
to the law for man: grant us the true circumcision of the spirit, that our
hearts and all our members being mortified from all worldly and carnallusts,
may in all things obey thy blessed will, through the same thy Son Jesus Christ
our Lord.

The Epistle.
BLessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. Rom 4.8.
Came this blessedness then upon the circumcision, or upon the uncircumcision
also? for wesay that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. Now was
it then reckoned? when he wasin circumcision, or when he was in the
uncircumcision? not in time of circumcision, but when he was yet
vncircumciseb. And he received the sgne of circumcision, as a seal of the
righteousness of faith, which he had yet being uncircumcision, that he should
be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised, that
righteousness might be imputed to them also, and that he might be the father
of circumcision, not unto them only which came of the circumcised, but unto
them also that walk in the steps of the faith that was in our father Abraham
before the time of circumcision. For the promise (that he should be heir of
the world) happened not to Abraham, or to his seed through the Law, but
through the righteousuesse of faith. For if they which are of the Law, be
heirs, then is faith but va^e, and the promise of none effect.

The Gospel.
ANd it fortuned, as soon as the Angels were gone away from the shepherds into
heaven, Luke 2.15.
they said one to another, Let us go even now unto Bethlehem, and see this
thing that we hear say is happened, which the Lord has showed unto us. And
they came with haste, and found Marie and Joseph, and the babe laid in a
ma^ger. And when they had seen it, they published abroad the saying that was
tolbe them of that child. And all they that heard it, Wondered at those things
which were told them of the shepherds. But Marie kept all these sayings, and
pondred them in her heart. And the shepherds returned praising and lauding God
for all the things, that they had heard and seen, even as it was told unto
them. And when the eight day was come, that the child should be circumcised,
his name was called Jesus, which was named of the Angel before he was
conceived in the womb.

If there be a Sunday between the Epiphanie and the Circumcision, then shall
be used the same Collect, Epistle and Gospel at the Communion, which was used
upon the day of Circumcision.

The epiphanie.
The Collect.
O God which by the leading of a star did mamfest thy only begotten
son to the Gentiles: mercifully grant, that we which know thee now by faith,
may after this life have the fruition of thy glorious Godhead, through Christ
our Lord, Amen.

The Epistle.
FOr this cause I Paul am a prisoner of Jesus Christ for you heathen, Ephesians. 3.1.
if ye have heard of the ministration of the grace of God which is given me
to youward. For by revelation showed he the mystery unto me. as I wrote before
in few words, whereby when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the
mystery of Christ, which mystery in times past was not opened unto the sons
of men, as it is now declared unto his holy Apostles and Prophets by the
Spirit, that the Gentiles should be inheriters also, and of the same body,
and partakers of his promise of Christ, by the means of the Gospel: where of I
am made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God, which is given
unto me after the working of his power. Unto me the least of all Saints is this
grace given, that I should preath among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches
of Christ, and to make all men see what the fellowship of the mystery is,
which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, which made all
things through Jesus Christ, to the intent that now unto the rulers and powers
in heavenly things, might be known by the congregation, the manifold wisdom
of God, according to the eternal purpose which he wrought in Christ Jesus our
Lord, by whom we have boldness and entrance with the confidence which is by
the faith of him.

The Gospel.
WHen Jesus was borne in Bethlehem, acitie of Jury, Man. 2.1.
in the time of Herod the King: behold, there came wife men from the East to
Jerusalem, saying, Where is he that is borne King of the Jews? for we have
feeue his star in the East, and are come to worship him. When Herod the
King had heard these things, he wastroubled, and all the City of Jerusalem
with him. And when he had gathered all the chief Prists and Scribes of the
people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be borne. And they
said unto him, At Bethlehem in Jury: for thus it is written by the Prophet,
And thou Bethlehem in the land of Jury, art not the least among the princes of
Jude: For out of thee shall come unto me the captain that shall govern my
people Israel. Then Herod, when he had privily called the wife men, he
enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. And he bad them go
to Bethlehem, and said, Go your way thither, and search diligently for the
child: and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come
and worship him also. When they had heard the king, they departed, and lo, the
star which they saw in the East, went before them, til it came and stood over
the place wherein the child was. when they saw the star, they wereexteeding
glad, and went into the house, and found the child with Mary his mother, and
felldowne flat, and worshipped him, and opened their treasures, and offered
unto him gifts, gold, frankencense, and myrrh. And after they were warued of
God in a sleep, that they should not go again to Herod, they returned into
their own Country another way.

The first Sunday after the Epiphanie.
The Collect.
LOrd, we beseech thee mercifully to receive the prayers of thy people which
call upon thee, and grant that they may both perceive and know what things
they ought to do, and also have grace and power faithfully to fulfill the same,
through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

The Epistle.
I Beseech you therefore brethren, by the mercifulness of God, Romans 12.1.
that ye make your bodies a quick sacrifice, holy, and acceptable unto God,
which is your reaso^able serving of GOd. And fashion not your selus like unto
this word: but be ye changed in your shape, by the renewing of your mind, that
ye may prove what thing that good and acceptable and perfect will of God is.
For I say (through the grace that unto me given is) to every man among you,
that no man stand high in his own conceit, more then it becomes him to
esteem of himself: but so judge of himself, that he be gentle and sober,
according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith. For as we have
many members in one body, and all members have not one office: So we, being
many, are one body in Christ, and every man among our selves, one another
members.

The Gospel.
THE father and mother of Jesus went to Jerusalem, Luke. 2.43
after the custom of the feast day. And when they had fulfilled the days, as
they returned home, the child Jesus abode still at Jerusalem, and his father
anb mother knew not of it: but they supposing him to have been in the
company, came a days Journey, and sought him among their kinsefolke and
acquaintance: and when they found him not, they went back again to
Jerusalem, and sought him. And it fortuned, that after three days they found
him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them, and
posing them. And all that heard him, were astonished at his understanding and
answers. And when they saw him, they marueiled. And his mother said unto him,
son, why have thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought
thee sorowing. And he said unto them, How happened it that ye sought me? wist ye
not that I must go about my fathers business? And they under stood not that
saying which he spoke unto them. And he went down with them, and came to
Nazareth, and was obedient unto them. But his mother kept all these sayings
together in her heart. And Jesus prospred in wisdom and age, and in favor
with God and men.

The second Sunday after the Epiphanie.
The Collect.
Almighty and everlasting God, which do govern all things in heaven and
earth: mercifully hear the supplications of thy people, and grant us thy grace
all the days of our life.

The Epistle.
SEeing that we have diverse gifts, according to the grace that is given unto
us, Romans 12.6.
if a man have the gift of prophecy, let him have it, that it be agreeing to
the faith. Let him that has an office, wait on his office. Let him that
teaches, take heed to his doctrine. Let him that exhorts, give attendance to
his exhortation. If any man give, let him do it with singleness. Let him that
rules, do it with diligence. If any man show mercy, let him do it with
cheerfulness. Let love be without dissimulation. Hate that which is evil,
and cleave unto which is good. Be kind one to another with brotherly love. In
giving honor, go one before another. Be not slothful in the business which
ye have in hand. Be fervent in spirit. Apply your selves to the time. Rejoice
in hope. Be patient in tribulation. Continue in prayer. Distribute unto the
necessity of the Saints. Be ready to harbor. Bless them which persente you.
Bless, I say and curse not. Be merry with them that are merry, weep with them
that weep. Be of like affection one toward another. Be not high minded, but
make your selves equal to them of the lower sort.

The Gospel.
ANd the third day was there amariage in Cana a city of Galilee, John. 2.1.
and the mother of Jesus was there. And Jesus was called (and his disciples)
unto the marriage. And when the wine failed, the mother of Jesus said unto him,
They have no wine. Jesus said unto her, woman, what have I to do with thee?
mine hour is not yet come. His mother said unto the ministers, whatsoever he
says unto you, do it. And there were standing there fix water pots of stone,
after the manner of purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins
apiece. Jesus said unto them. Fill the water pots with water. And they filled
them to the brim. And he said unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the
governor of the feast. And they bare it. When the ruler of the feast had tasted
the water turned into wine, and knew not whence it was (but the ministers which
drew the water, knew) he called the bridegroom, and said unto him, Every man at
the beginning does fet forth good wine, and when men be drunk, the^ that
which is worse: but thou have kept ye good wine now. This beginning of miracles
did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and showed his glory, and his disciples believed
on him.

The third Sunday after the Epiphanie.
The Collect.
Almighty and everlasting God, mercifully look upon our infirmities, and in all
our dangers and uecessties stretch forth thy right hand to help and defend us,
through Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
BE not wise in your own opinions. Romans 12.16.
Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide aforeha^d things honest not only
before God, but also in the sight of all men. If it be possible (as much as in
you is) live peaceably with all men. Dearly beloved, avenge not your selves,
but rather give place unto wrath. for it is written, Vengeance is mine, I will
reward, says the Lord. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him, is he
thirst, give him drink: For inso doing, thou shall heap coals of fire on his
head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with goodness.

The Gospel.
WHen he was come down from the mountain, Matt. 8.1.
much people followed him. And behold, there came a leper and worshipped him,
saying, Master, if thou will, thou can make me clean. And Jesus put forth
his hand, and touched him, saying, I will, be thou clean. And immediately his
leprosy was cleansed. And Jesus said unto him. Tell no man, but go and show
thy self to the Priest, and offer the gift (that Moses commanded to be
offered) for a witnesie unto them. And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum,
there came unto him a Centurio^ and besought him, saying, Master, my servant
lies at home sick of the palsy, and is grieuoussly pained. And Jesus said,
when I come unto him, I will heal him. The Centuriom answered and said, Sir, I
am not worthy that thou should come under my roof: but speak the word
only, and my servant shall be healed. For I also my self am a man subject to
the auyhority of another, and have soldiers under me: and I say to this man,
Go and he goes: and to another man, Come, and he comes: and to my servant,
Do this, and he does it. When Jesus heard these words, he maruciled, and said
to them that followed him, Verily I say unto you: I have not found so great
faith in Israel. I say unto you, that many shall come from the East and West,
and shall rest with Abraham Isahar, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven: But the
children of the kingdom shall be cast out into utter darkness, there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth. And Jesus said unto the Centurion, Go thy way,
and as thou beleeuest so be it unto thee. And his servant was healed the self
same hour.

The fourth Sunday after the Epiphanie.
The Collect.
GOd which know us to be set in the mids of so many and great dangers, that
for man's frailnesse we cannot always stand uprightly, grant to us the health
of body and soul, that all those things which we suffer for sin, by thy
help we may well pass and overcome, through Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
LEt every soul submit himself e unto the authority of ye higher power: for
there is nopower but of God. Romans 13.1.
The powers that be, are ordained of god. Whoesoeuer therefore resists power,
resists the ordinance of God: but they that resist, shall receive to
themselves damnation. For rulers are not fearful to them that do good, but
to them that do evil. Will thou be without fear of the power? do well then,
and so shall thou be praised of the same: for he is the minister of God for thy
wealth. But if thou do that which is evil, then fear: for he bears not
the sword of naught: for he is the minister of God to take vengeance on them
that do evil. Wherefore ye must needs obey, not only for fear of
vengeance, but also because of conscience, and even for this cause pay ye
tribute: For they are Gods ministers, serving for the same purpose. Give to
every man therefore his duty: tribute, to whom tribute belongs: longs:
custom, to whom custom is due: fear, to whom fear belongs honor, to whom
honor pertains.

The Cospel.
AND when he entered into a ship, Mat. 8 23.
his Disciples followed him. And behold, there arose a great tempest in the
sea, insomuch as the ship was covered with waves, but he was a sleep. And his
Disciples came to him and awoke him, saying, Master save us, we perish. And
he said unto them, why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he
arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea, another followed a great calm. But
the men marueiled, saying, what manner of man is this, that both winds and sea
obey him? And when he was come to the other side, into the country of the
Gergesites, there met him two possessed of devils, which came out of the
graves, and were out of measure fierce, so that no man might go by that way.
And behold, they cried out, saying, O Jesus thou son of God, what have we to
do with thee? Art thou come hither to torment us nefore the time? And there
was a good way off from them a herd of many swine feeding. So the devils
besought him, saying, If thou cast us outr, suffer us to go into the herd of
swine. And he said unto them, Go your ways. Then went they out, and departed
into the herd of swine. And behold, the whole herd of swine was carried
headlong into the sea, and perished in the waters. Then they that kept them,
fled, and went their ways into the city, and told euerything, and what had
happened unto the possessed of thew devils. And behold, the whole city came
out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would
depart out of their coasts.

The fifth Sunday after the Epiphanie.
The Collect.
LOrd, we beseech thee to keep thy Church and household continually in thy
true religion, that they which do lean only upon hope of thy heavenly grace,
may evermore be defended by thy mighty power, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
PVt upon you, as the elect of God, Col. 3.12.
tender mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind meekness, long suffering,
forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel
against another: as Christ forgave you, even so do ye. Above all these things
put on love, which is the bond of perfectness. And the peace of God rule in
your hearts, to the which peace ye are called in one body: and see that ye
thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you plenteously, with all wisdom.
Teach and exhort your own selves in Psalms and Hymns, and spiritual songs,
singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word
or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father
by him.

The Gospel.
THe kingdom of heaven is like unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:
but while men slept his enemy came, Matthew. 13.24
and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was
sprung up, and had brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. So the
servants of the house-holder came, and said unto him, Sir, did not thou
sow good seed in thy field: from whence then has it tares. He said unto them,
The envious man has done this. The servants said unto him, Will thou then that
we go and weed them up: But he said, Nay least while ye gather up the tares,
ye pluck up also the wheat with them: let both grow together until the
harvest, and in the time of harvest, I will say to the Reapers, Gather ye first
the tares, and bind them together in sheaues to be burnt, but gather the wheat
into my barn.

The sixth Sunday (if there be so many) shall have the same Collect, Epistle and
Gospel, that was upon the fist Sunday.

The Sunday called Septuagesima.
The Collect.
O Lord, we beseech thee favorably to hear the prayers of thy people, that
we which are justly punished for our offenses, may be mercifully delivered by
thy goodness, for the glory of thy Name, through Jesus Christ our Savior, who
lives and reigns world with out end. Amen.

The Epistle.
Perceive ye not, how that they which run in a course, 1. Cor. 9.24.
run all, but one receives the reward? So run, that ye may obtain. Every
man that proves masteries, absteineth from all things: and they do it to
obtain a crown that shall perish, but we to obtain an everlasting crown. I
therefore so run, not as at an uncertain thing: so fight I, not as one that
beats the air: but I came my body, and bring it into subjection, least by
any means it come to pass, that when I have preached to other, I my self
should be cast away.

The Gospel.
THe kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an Householder, Mat. 20.1.
which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyarde. And
when the agreement was made with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them
into his vineyarde. And he went out about the third hour, and saw other
standing idle in the market place, and said unto them, Go ye also into
vineyarde, and whatsoever is right, I will give you. And they went their way.
Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. And
about the eleventh hour he went out, and found other standing idle, and said
unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? They said unto him, Because no
man has hired us. He says unto them, Go ye also into the vineyarde, and
whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive. So when even was come, the Lord of
the vineyarde said unto his Steward, Call the laborers, anb give them their
hire, beginning at the last, until the first. And when they did come that came
about the eleue^th hour, they rceiued every man a penny. But when the first
came also, they supposed that they should have received more, and they likewise
received every man a penny. And when they had received it, they murmured against
the goodman of the house, saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and
thou have made them equal with us, which have borne the burden and heat of
the day. But he answered unto one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no
wrong: Did thou not agree with me for a penie: Take that thine is, and go
thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for
me to do as me lusts with mine own goods? Is thine eye evil, because I am
good: So the last shall be first, and the first shall be last. For many be
called, but few be chosen.

The Sunday called Sexagesima.
The Collect.
LOrd God, which see that we put not our trust in any thing that we do:
mercifully grant, that by thy power we may be defended against all adversity,
through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
YE suffer fools gladly, 2. Cor. 11.19.
seeing your selue sare wise. For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage,
if a man devour, if a man take, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on
the face. I speak as concerning rebuke, as though we had been weak in this
behalf. Howbeit, wherein soever any man dare be bold (I speak foolishly) I
dare be bold also. They are Hebrews, even so am I. They are Israelites, even
so am I. They are the seed of Abraham, even so am I. They are the ministers of
Christ, (I speak as a fool) I am more. In labors more abundant, in stripes
above measure, in prison more ple^teously, in death often. Of the Jews five
times received I forty stripes save one. Thrice was I beaten with rods, I was
once stoned, I suffered thrice shipwreck, night and day have I been in the
deep sea. In iourneying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in
ieopardies of mine own nation, in ieopardies among the Heathen, in perils in
the City, in perils in wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among
false brethren, in labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and
thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness: beside the things which
outwardly happen unto me, I am cumbred daily, and do care for all
congregations. Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn
not? If I must needs boast, I will boast of the things that concern mine
infirmities. The God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for
evermore, knows that I lie not.

The Gospel.
WHen much people were gathered together, Luke. 84.
and were come to him out of all cities, he spoke by a similitude, The sower
went out to sow his seed, and as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and it
was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it up. And some fell on
stones, and as soon as it was fprung up, it withered away, because it lacked
moystnesse. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it, and
choked it. And some fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an
hundredth fold. And as he said these things, he cried, He that has cares to
hear, let him hear. And his disciples asked him, saying, What manner of
similitude is this? And he said, Unto you it is given to know the secrets of
the kingdom of God, but to other by parables, that when they see, they should
not see, and when they hear, they should not understand. The parable is this.
The seed is the word of God. Those that are beside the way, are they that
hear, then comes the devil, and takes away the word out of their hearts,
least they should believe and be saved. They on the stones, are they, which
when they hear, receive the word with joy, and these have no roots, which for
a while believe, and in time of temptation go away. And that which fell among
thorns, are they, which when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with
cares and riches, and voluptuous living, and bring forth no fruit. That which
fell in the good ground, are they, which with a pure and good heart hear the
word, and keep it, and bring forth fruit through patience.

The Sunday called Quinquagesima.
The Collect.
O Lord, which do teach us that all our doings without charity are nothing
worth: send thy holy Ghost, and power into our hearts that most excellent gift
of charity, the very bond of peace and all virtues, without the which
whosoever lives, is counted dead before thee: Grant this for thine only
Son Jesus Christ's sake.

The Epistle.
THough I speak with tongues of men, 1 Cor. 13.1.
and of Angels, and have no love, I am even as sounding brass, or as a
tinckling Cymball. And though I could prophecy, and understand all secrets,
and all knowledge: yea, if I have all faith, so that I could mountains out of
their places, and yet have no love, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my
goods to feed the poor, and though I gave my body even that I burned, and yet
have no love, it profits me nothing. Love suffers long, and is courteous,
love enuieth not, love does not frowardly, swells not, deals not
dishonestly, seeks not her own, is not provoked to anger, thinks none
evil, rejoices not in iniquity: but rejoices in the truth, suffers all
things, believes all things, hops all things, endures all things. Though
that prophesying fail, either tongues cease, or knowledge vanish away, yet
love falls never away. For our knowledge is imperfect, and our prophesying is
imperfect: But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is imperfect
shall be done away. When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a
child, I imagined as a child: But as soon as I was a man, I put away
childishness. Now we see in a glass, even in a dark speaking: but then
shall we see face to face. Now I know imperfectly: But then shall I know, even
as I am known. Now abides faith, hope, and love, even these three: but the
chief of these is love.

The Gospel.
Jesus took unto him twelve, and said unto them, Behold, Lu. 18.31.
we go up to Jerusalem, and all shall be fulfilled which are written by the
Prophets of the son of man. For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles,
and shall be mocked, and despightfully entreated, and spitted on. And when
they have scourged him, they will put him to death, and the third day he shall
rise again. And they understood none of these things. And this saying was hid
from them, so that they perceived not the things which were spoken. And it came
to pass, that as he was come nigh to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by
the high way side, begging. And when he heard the people pass by, he asked
what it meant. And they said unto, him, that Jesus of Nazareth passed by. And
he cried, saying, Jesus thou son of David, have mercy on me. And they which
went before, rebuked him, that he should hold his peace. But he cried so much
the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. And Jesus stood still, and
commanded him to be brought unto him. And when he was come near, he asked
him, saying, What will thou that I do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I
might receive my sight. And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight, thy faith
has saved thee. And immediately he received his sight, and followed him,
praising God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.

The first day of Lent.
The Collect.
Almighty and everlasting God, which hate nothing that thou have made, and
do forgive the sins of al them that be penitent: create and make in us new
and contrite hearts, that we woorthily lamenting our sins, and knowledging
our wretchedness, may obtain of thee the God of al mercy, perfect remission
and forgiveness, through Jesus Christ.

The Epistle.
TVrne you unto me with all your hearts, with fasting, 1 ocl 2. 12.
weeping, and mourning: rent your hearts, and not your clothes. Turn you unto
the Lord your God, for he is gracious and merciful, long suffering and of great
compassion, and ready to pardon wickedness. Then (no doubt) he also shall turn
and forgive: and after his chastening, he shall let your increase remain for
meat and drink offerings unto the Lord your God. Blow out with the trumpet
in Sion, proclaim a fasting, call the congregation, and gather the people
together: warn the congregation, gather the Elders, bring the children and
sucklings together. Let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride
out of her closet. Let the Priests serve the Lord between the porch and the
altar, weeping, and saying, Be favorable, O Lord, be favorable unto thy
people, let not thine heritage be brought to such confusion, least the heathen
be lords thereof. Wherefore should they say among the Heathen, Where is now
their God.

The Gospel.
WHen ye fast, Mat. 6.16.
be not sad, as the hypocrites are: For they diffigure their faces, that it may
appear unto men how that they fast. Verily I say unto you, they have their
reward. But thou, when thou fastest, annoint thine head, and wash thy face,
that it appear not unto men how that thou fastest, but unto thy father which
is in secret, and thy father which sees in secret, shall reward thee openly.
Lay not up for your selves treasure upon earth, where the rust and moth does
corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for you
treasures in heaven, where neither rust nor moth does corrupt, and where
thieves do not break through nor steal. For where your treasure is, there will
your hearts be also.

The first Sunday in Lent.
The Collect.
O Lord, which for our sake did fast forty days and forty nights: give
us grace to use such abstinence, that our flesh being subdued to the spirit,
we may ever obey thy godly motions in righteousness and true holiness, to thy
honor and glory, which live and raignest, etc.

The Epistle.
WE as helpers exhort you, 2 Cor. 6.1
that ye receive not the grace of GOD in vain. For he says, I have heard
thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succored thee.
Behold, now is that accepted time: Behold, now is that day of salvation. Let us
give none occasion of evil, that in our office be found no fault: but in all
things let us behave our selves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in
afflictions, in necessities, in auguish, in stripes, in prisonments, in
strifes, in labors, in watchings, in fastings, in pureness, in knowledge, in
long suffering, in kindness, in the holy Ghost, in love unfeigned, in the word
of truth, in the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right
hand and on the left, by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report,
as deceivers, and yet true, as unknown, and yet known, as dying, and behold
we live, as chastened, and not killed, as sorrowing, and yet always merry, as
poor, and yet making many rich, as having nothing, and yet possessing all
things.

The Gospel.
THen Jesus was led away of the spirit into the wilderness, Mat 4.1.
to be tempted of the devil. And when he had fasted forty days and
forty nights, he was at the last an hungered. And when the tempter came to
him, he said, If thou be the son of God, command that these stones be
made bread. But he answered, and said, It is written, Man shall not live by
bread only, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. Then
the devil takes him up into the holy city, and sets him on a pinnacle of
the temple, and says unto him, If thou be the son of God, cast thy self
down headlong: for it is written. He shall give his Angels charge over thee,
and with their hands they shall hold thee up, least at any time thou dash thy
foot against a stone. And Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou
shall not tempt the Lord thy God. Again, the devil takes him up into an
exceeding high mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and the
glory of them, and says unto him, All these will I give thee, if thou will
fall down and worship me. Then says Jesus unto him, Avoid Satan, for it is
written, Thou shall worship the Lord God, and him only shall thou serve. Then
the devil leaves him, and behold, the Angels came and ministered unto him.

The second Sunday in Lent.
The Collect.
Almighty God, which do see that we have no power of our selves to help
our selves: keep thou us both outwardly in our bodies, and inwardly in our
souls, that we may be defended from all adversities, which may happen to the
body, and from all evil thoughts which may assault and hurt the soul,
through Iersus Christ, etc.

The Epistle.
WE beseech you brethren, 1. These. 4.1
and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that ye increase more and more, even as ye
have received of us, how ye ought to walk, and to please God. For ye know
what commandments we gave you by our Lord Jesus Christ. For this is the will
of God, even your holiness: that ye should abstain from fornication, and that
every one of you should know how to keep his vessel in holiness and honor,
and not in the lust of concupiscene, as do the Heathen, which know not God:
that no man oppress and defraud his brother in bargaining, because that the
Lord is the auenger of all such things, as we told you before, and testified.
For God has not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness, He therefore
that despises, despises not man, but God, which has sent his holy spirit
among you.

The Gospel.
Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tire and Sidon: and
behold, Matt. 15.21
a woman of Canaan (which came out of the same coasts) cried unto him, saying,
Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David: my daughter is piteously vexed
with a devil. But he answered her nothing at all. And his disciples came and
besought him, saying, Send her away, for she cries after us. But he answered
and said, I am not sent, but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Then
came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord help me. He answered and said, It
is not meet to take the childrens bread, and cast it to dogs. She answered
and said, Truth Lord, for the dogs eat of the crummes which fall from their
masters table. Then Jesus answered, and said unto her, O woman, great is thy
faith, be it unto thee even as thou will. And her daughter was made whole even
the same time.

The third Sunday in Lent.
The Collect.
WE beseech thee almighty God, look upon the hearty desire of thy humble
servants, and stretch forth the right hand of thy majesty, to be our defense
against all our enemies, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
BE you the folowers of God as dear children, Ephesians. 5.1
and walk in love, even as Christ loved us, and gave himself for us, an
offering and a sacrifice of a sweet savor to God. As for fornication, and al
uncleanness or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as it becomes
saints, or filthiness, or foolish talking, or icsting, which are not comely,
but rather giving of thanks. For this ye know, that no whoremonger, either
unclean person, or covetous person (which is a worshipper of images) has any
inheritance in the kingdom of Christ, and of God. Let no man deceive you with
vain words: For because of such things, comes the wrath of God upon the
children of disobedience. Be ye not therefore companions of them. Ye were
sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of
light: for the fruit of the spirit consists in all goodness, and righteousness,
and truth. Accept that which is pleasing unto the Lord, and have no fellowship
with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather rebuke them. For it is a
shame even to name those things which are done of them in secret: but all
things when they are brought forth by the light, are manifest. For whatsoever
is manifest, the same is light. Wherefore he says, Awake thou that sleep,
and stand up from death, and Christ shall give thee light.

The Gospel.
Jesus was casting out a devil that was dumb. Lu. 11.14
And when he had cast out the devil, the dumb spoke, and the people wondered.
But some of them said, He casts out devils through Beelzebub the chief of
the Deuiles. And other tempted him, and required of him a sign from heaven.
But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided
against it self, is desolate, and one house does fall upon another. If Satan
also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom endure? Because ye
say I cast out deuiles through Beelzebub. If I by the help of Beelzebub cast
out devils, by whose help do your children cast them out? Therefore shall
they be your Judges. But if I by the finger of God cast out deuiles, no doubt
the kingdom of God is come upon you. When a strong man armed watches his
house, the things that he possesses are in peace: But when a stronger them he
comes upon him, and overcomes him, he takes from him al his harness,
wherein he trusted, and dimdeth his goods. He that is not with me, is against
me: and he that gathers not with me, scatters abroad. When the unclean
spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest: and
when he finds none, he says, I will return again into my house whence I
came out. And when he comes, he finds it swept and garnished. Then goes
he, and takes to him seven other spirits worse then himself, and they enter
in, and dwell there: and the end of that man is worse then the beginning. And
it fortuned, that as he spoke these things, a certain woman of the company
lift up her voice, and said unto him, Happy is the womb that bare thee, and
the pappes which gave thee suck. But he said, Yea, happy are they that hear
the word of God, and keep it.

The fourth Sunday in Lent.
The Collect.
Grant we beseech thee almighty God, that we which for our evil deeds are
worthily punished, by the comfort of thy grace may mercifully be relieved,
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

The Epistle.
TEll me (ye that desire to be under the law) do ye not hear of the law? for
it is written, Gal 4.21.
that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondmaide, the other by a free
woman. Yea, and he which was borne of the bondwoman, was borne after the flesh:
but he which was borne of the free woman, was borne by promise. Which things
are spoken by an allegory: for these are two testaments, the one from the
mount Sina, which gendreth unto bondage, which is Agar: for mount Sina is Agar
in Arabia, and bordereth upon the city which is now called Jerusalem, and is
in bondage with her children. But Jerusalem which is above, is free, which is
the mother of us all. For it is written, Rejoice thou barren that bear no
children, break forth and cry thou that trauellest not: for the desolate
has many more children, then she which has an husband.

Brethren, we are after Isahac the children of promise. But as then he that was
borne after the flesh, persecuted him that was borne after the spirit: even so
is it now. Nevertheless, what says the Scripture? Put away the bondwoman and
her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of
the freewoman. So then brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of
the freewoman.

The Gospel.
Jesus departed over the Sea of Galilee, Ioh. 6.1.
which is the sea of Tiberias, and a great multitude followed him, because they
saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased. And Jesus went up
into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. And Easter (a feast of
the Jews) was nigh. When Jesus then lift up his eyes, and saw a great company
come unto him, he said unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may
eat? This he said to prove him, for he himself knew what he would do.
Philip answered him, Two hundredth penywoorth of bread are not sufficient for
them, that every man may take a little. One of his disciples (Andrew, Simon
Peter's brother) says unto him, There is a lad which has five barley loaves,
and two fishes: but what are they among so many? And Jesus said, Make the
people sit down. There was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in
number about five thousand. And Jesus took the bread, and when he had given
thanks, he gave to the Disciples, and the Disciples to them that were set
down, and like wise of the fishes, as much as they would. When they had eaten
enough, he said unto his Disciples, Gather up the broken meat which
remains, that nothing be lost. And they gathered it together, and filled
twelve baskets with the broken meat of the five barley loaves, which broken
meat remained unto them that had eaten. Then those men (when they had seen
the miracle that Jesus did) said, This is of a truth the same Prophet that
should come into the world.

The fifth Sunday in Lent.
The Collect.
WE beseech thee almighty God, mercifully to look upon thy people, that by
thy great goodness they may be governed and preserved evermore, both in body
and soul, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
CHrist being an high Priest of good things to come, Heb. 9.11.
came by a greater and a more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is
to say, not of this building, neither by the blood of Goats and calves: but by
his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, and found eternal
redemption. For if the blood of Oxen and of Goats, and the ashes of a young
Cow, when it is sprinkled, purifieth the unclean, as touching the purifying
of the flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ (which through the
eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God) purge your conscience
from dead works, for to serve the living God? And for this cause is he the
mediator of the new Testament, that through death, which chanced for the
redemption of those transgressions that were under the first Testament, they
which are called, might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.

The Gospel.
WHich of you can rebuke me of sin? If I say the truth, Ioh. 8.46.
why do ye not believe me? He that is of God, hears Gods words: Ye therefore
hear them not, because ye are not of God. Then answered ye Jews, and said
unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritane, and have the devil?
Jesus answered, I have not the devil: but I honor my Father, and ye have
dishonored me. I seek not mine own praise, there is one that seeks and
judges. Verily, verily I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never
see death. Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou have the devil.
Abraham is dead, and the Prophets, and thou say, If a man keep my saying,
he shall never taste of death. Art thou greater then our father Abraham, which
is dead? And the Prophets are dead: Whom make thou thy self? Jesus answered,
If I honor my self, mine honor is nothing: it is my father that honors
me, which ye say is your God, and yet ye have not known him: but I know him.
And if I say I know him not, I shall be alyar like unto you. But I know him and
keep his saying. Your father Abraham was glad to see my day: and he saw it and
rejoiced. Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and
half thou seen Abraham? Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily I say unto you,
yer Araham was borne, I am. Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus
hid himself, and went out of the temple.

The Sunday next before Easter.
The Collect.
Almighty and everlasting God, which of thy tender love toward man, have sent
our savior Jesus Christ, to take upon him our flesh, and to suffer death upon
the cross, that all mankind should follow the example of his great
humility: mercifully grant, that we both follow the example of his patience,
and be made partakers of his resurrection, through the same Jesus Christ our
Lord.

The Epistle.
LEt the same mind be in you, Phil. 2.5.
that was also in Christ Jesus, which when he was in the shape of God: thought
it no robbery to be equal with God: Nevertheless he made himsselfe of no
reputation, taking on him the shape of a servant, and became like unto men, and
was found in his apparel as a man. He humbled himself, and became obedient
unto the death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God has also exalted
him on high, and given him a name, which is above al names, that in the name of
Jesus every knee should bow, both of things in heaven, and things in earth, and
things under the earth, and that all tongues should confess that Jesus Christ
is the Lord, unto the praise of God the father.

The Gospel.
AND it came to pass, Mat. 26.1.
when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples, Ye
know that after two days shall be Easter, and the son of man shall be
delivered over to be crucified. Then assembled together the thief Priests,
and the Scribes, and the Elders of the people, unto the palace of the high
Priest (which was called Caiaphas) and held a counsel, that they might take
Jesus by subtlety, and kill him. But they said, Not on the holy day, least
there be an uproar among the people. When Jesus was in Bethanie, in the house
of Simon the Leyer, there came unto him a woman, having an Alabaster box of
precious ointment, and powered it on his head as he sat at the board. But when
his disciples saw it, they had indignation, sayig, Whereto serves this waste?
This ointment might have been welsolde, and given to the poor. When Jesus
understood that, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she has
wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you, but me ye
shall not have always. And in that she has cast this ointment on my body,
she did it to bury me. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be
preached in all the world, there shall also this be told that she has done, for
a memorial of her. Then one of the twelve (which was called Judas Iscariot)
went unto the chief Priests, and said unto them, What will ye give me, and I
will deliver him unto you? And they appointed unto him thirty pieces of
silver. And from that time forth, he sought opportunite to betray him. The
first day of sweet bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where
will thou that we prepare for thee to eat the Passover? And he said, Go
into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The master says, My time is
at hand: I will keep my Easter by thee with my disciples. And the disciples did
as Jesus had appointed them, and they made ready the Passover. When the even
was come, he sat down with the twelve: and as they did eat, he said, Verily
I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. And they were exceeding
sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? He
answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall
betray me. The son of man truly goes as it is written of him: but woe unto
that man by whom the son of man is betrayed: it had been good for that man if
he had not been borne. Then Judas which betrayed him, answered and said,
Master, Is it I? He said unto him, Thou have said. And when they were eating,
Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave it to
the disciples, and said, Take, eat, this is my body. And he took the cup,
and thanked, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of this: for this is my
blood (which is of the new Testament) that is shed for many, for the remission
of sins. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of
the vine tree, until that day when I shall drink it new with you in my fathers
kingdom. And when they had said grace, they went out unto mount Oliuet. Then
said Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: For
it is written, I will smite the Sheepehearde, and the sheep of the flock
shall be scattered abroad: but after I am risen again, I willl go before you
into Galile. Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men be offended
because of thee, yet will not I be offended. Jesus said unto him, Verily I say
unto thee, that in this same night, before the Cock crow thou shall deny me
thrice. Peter said unto him, Yea, though I should die with thee, yet will I not
deny thee. Likewise also said all the Disciples. Then came Jesus with them unto
a Farm place (which is called Gethsemane) and said unto the disciples, Sit ye
here while I go and pray yonder. And he took with him Peter and the two
sons of Zebedee, and began to wax sorrowful and heavy. Then said Jesus
unto them, My soul is heavy, even unto the death: tarry ye here, and watch
with me. And he went a little further, and fell flat on his face, and prayed,
saying O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:
nevertheless not as I will, but as thou will. And he came unto the Disciples,
and found them asleep, and said unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me
one hour: Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: The spirit is
willing, but the flesh is weak. He went away once again, and prayed, saying,
O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink of it,
thy will be fulfilled. And he came and found them asleep again, for their
eyes were heavy. And he left them, and went again, and prayed the third time,
saying the same words. Then comes he to his Disciples, and said unto them,
Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son
of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us be going, behold, he
is at hand that does betray me. While he yet spoke, lo, Judas one of the
number of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and
staves sent from the chief Priests and Elders of the people. But he that
betrayed him, gave them a token, saying, Whomsoever I kiss, the same is he,
hold him fast. And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail Master, and
kissed him. And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then
came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. And behold, one of them
which were with Jesus, stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck
a servant of hie Priest, and smote off his ear. Then said Jesus unto him, Put
up thy sword into the sheath: for all they that take the sword, shall perish
with the sword. Think thou that I cannot now pray to ny Father, and he
shall give me even now more then twelve legions of Angels? But how then shall
the Scriptures be fulfilled? For thus must it be. In that same hour said Jesus
to the multitude, Ye be come out as it were to a thief, with swords and staves
for to take me. I sat daily with you teaching in the Temple, and ye took me
not. But all this was done, that the Scriptures of the Prophets might be
fulfiled. Then all the disciples forsook him and fled. And they took Jesus,
and led him to Caiaphas the high Priest, where the Scribes and the Elders were
assembled. But Peter followed him afar off unto the hie Priests palace, and
went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. The chief Priests and
Elders, and all the counsel sought false witness against Jesus, for to put
him to death, but found none: yea, when many false witnesses came, yet found
they none. At the last came two false witnesses, and said, This follow said I
am able to destroy the Temple of GOD, and, to build it again in three days.
And the chief Priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? Why do
these bear witness against thee? But Jesus held his peace. And the chief
Priest answered, and said unto him, I charge thee by the living God, that thou
tell us whether thou be Christ the Son of God. Jesus said unto him, Thou
have said. Nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of
man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of the sky.
Then the high Priest rent his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy, what
need we of any more witnesses? Behold now ye have heard his blasphemy, what
think ye? They answered, and said, He is worthy to die. Then did they spit in
his face, and buffeted him with fists. And other smote him on the face with the
palm of their hands, saying, Tell us, thou Christ, who is he that smote
thee? Peter sat without in the Court, and a Damsel came to him, saying, Thou
also wast with Jesus of Galilee. But he denied before them all, saying, I wot
not what thou say. When he was gone out into the porch, another wench saw
him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of
Nazareth. And again he denied with an oath, saying, I do not know the man.
After a while came unto him they that stood by, and said unto Peter, Surely
thou art even one of them, for thy speech bewrays thee. Then began he to
curse and to swear that he knew not the man. And immediately the Cock crewe.
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the Cock
crow, thou shall deny me thrice: and he went out and wept bitterly. When the
morning was come, all the chief Priests and Elders of the people held a
counsel against Jesus to put him to death, and brought him bound, and
delivered him unto Pontius Pilate the Deputy. Then Judas which had betrayed
him (seeing that he was condemned) repented himself, and brought again the
xxx. plates of silver to the chief Priests and Elders, saying, I have sinned,
betraying the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to
that. And he cast down the silver plates in the Temple, and departed, and went
and hanged himself. And the chief Priests took the silver plates, and said,
It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of
blood. And they took counsel, and bought with them a potters field to bury
strangers in. Wherefore ye field is called Acheldama, that is, The field of
blood, until this day. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the
Prophet, saying, And they took xxx. silver plates, the price of him that was
valued, who^ they bought of the children of Israel, and gave them for the
potters field, as the Lord appointed me. Jesus stood before the Deputy, and
the Deputy asked him, saying, Art thou the king of the Jews? Jesus said unto
him Thou say. And when he was accused of the chief, Priests and Elders,
he answered nothing. Then said Pilate unto him, Hear thou not how many
witnesses they lay against thee? And he answered him to never a word,
insomuch that the Deputy marueiled greatly. At that feast, the Deputy was
wont to deliure unto people a prisoner, whom they would desire. He had then a
notable prisoner, called Barabbas. Therefore when they were gathered together,
Pilate said, Whether will ye that I give loose unto you Barabbas, or Jesus which
is called Christ? For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. When he
was set down to give judgment, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou
nothing to do with that just man, for I have suffered this day many things in
my sleep, because of him. But the chief Priests and Elders persuaded the
people that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. The Deputy answered,
and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I let loose unto you?
They said, Barabbas. Pilate said unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus,
which is called Christ? They all said unto him, Let him be crucified. The
Deputy said, What evil has he done? But they cried more, saying, Let him be
crucified. When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that more
business was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the pepple,
saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person, see ye. Then answered
all the people, and said, His blood be on us and on our children. Then let he
Barabbas loose unto them, and scourged Jesus and delivered him to be crucified.
Then the soldiers of the Deputy took Jesus into the common Hall, and
gathered unto him all the company, and they stripped him, and put on him a
purple robe, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it upon his head, and a
reed in his right hand, and bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying,
Hail King of the Jews. And when they had spit upon him, they took the reed,
and smote him on the head, and after that they had mocked him, they took the
robe off him again, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to
crucify him. And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene (named Simon)
him they compelled to bear his cross. And the came unto the place which is
called Golgotha, (that is to say, a place of dead men's skuls) and gave him
vinegar mingled with gall, to drink: and when he had tasted thereof, he would
not drink. When they had crucified him, they parted his garments, and did cast
lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet, They parted
my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots. And they sat
and watched him there, and set up over his head the cause of his death written,
This is Jesus the King of the Jews. Then were there two thieues crucified with
him, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. They that passed by,
reueiled him, wagging their heads, and saying, Thou that destroyedst the
Temple of God, and did build it in three days, save thy self. If thou be
the Son of GOD, come down from the cross. Likewise also the high Priests
mocking him, with the Scribes and Elders, said, He saved other, himself he
cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the
cross, and we will believe him. He trusted in God, let him deliver him now
if he will have him: For he said, I am the son of God. The thieues also which
were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth. From the sixth hour was
there darkness over all the land, until the ninth hour. And about the ninth
hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani, that
is to say, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? Some of them that stood
there, when they heard that, said, This man calls for Elias. And straightway
one of them ran, and took a sponge, and when he had filled it full of
vinegar, he put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. Other said, Let be,
let us see whether Elias will come, and deliver him. Jesus when he had cried
again with a loud voice yielded up the Ghost. And behold, the veil of the
Temple did rent in two parts from the top to the bottom, and the earth did
quake, and the stones rent, and graves did open, and many bodies of Saints
which slept, arose, and went out of the graves after his resurretion, and came
into the holy City, and appeared unto many. When the Centurion, and they that
were with him watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things which
happened, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the son of God. And
many women were there (beholding him afar off) which followed Jesus from
Galilee, ministering unto him: among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
mother of James and Ioses, and the mother of Zebedees children.

Monday before Easter.
The Epistle.
WHat is he this that comes from Edom, Esa 63.1.
with red colored clothes of Bosra (which is so costly cloth) and comes in
so mightily with all his strength? I am he that teaches righteousness, and
am of power to help. Wherefore then is thy clothing red, and thy rayme^t like
his that treads in the winepresse? I have trodden the press my self alone,
and of all people there is not one with me. Thus will I tread down mine
enemies in my wrath, and set my feet upon them in mine indignation, and their
blood shall bespring my clothes, and so will I stain al my raiment. For the
day of vengeance is assigned in mine heart, and the year when my people shall
be delivered, is come. I looked about me, and there was no man to show me any
help. Imarueiled that no man held me up. Then I held me by mine own arm,
and my feruentnesse sustained me. And thus will I tread down the people in my
wrath, and bathe them in my displeasure, and upon the earth will I lay their
strength: I will declare the goodness of the Lord, yea and the praise of the
Lord, for all that he has given us, for the great good that he has done
for Israel, which he has given them of his own favor, and according to the
multitude of his loving kindness. For he said, These no doubt are my people,
and no shrinking children: and so he was their Savior. In their troubles he
was also troubled with them, and the Angel that went forth from his presence
delivered them. Of very love and kindness that he had unto them, he redeemed
them. He has borne them, and carried them up, ever since the world began. But
after they provoked him to wrath, and vexed his holy mind, he was their
enemy, and fought against them himself. Yet remembered Israel the old time of
Moses and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them from the water of
the sea, with them that fed his sheep? Where is he thet has given his holy
spirit among them? He led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious
arm, dividing the water before them, whereby he gate himself an everlasting
name. He led them in the deep, as an horse is led in the plain, that they
should not stumble, as a tame beast goes in the field, and the breath given of
GOD, gives him rest. Thus (O God) have thou led thy people, to make thy self
a glorious Name withal. Look down then from heaven, and behold the dwelling
place of thy Sanctuary, and thy glory. How is it that thy jealousy, thy
strength, the multitude of thy mercies, and thy loving kindness will not be
entreated of us? yet art thou our Father. For Abraham knows us not, neither
is Israel acquainted with us. But thou Lord art our Father and redeemer, and
thy Name is everlasting. O Lord, wherefore have thou led us out of the way:
wherefore have thou hardened our hearts, that we fear thee not? Be at one with
us again for thy servants sake, and for the generation of thine heritage. Thy
people have had but a little of thy Sanctuary in possession, for our enemies
have trodden down thy holy place. And we were thine from the beginning, when
thou wast not their Lord, for they have not called upon thy name.

The Gospel.
AFter two days was Easter, Mar. 14.1.
and the days of sweet bread. And the high Priests and the Scribes sought
how they might take him by craft, and put him to death. But they said, Not in
the feast day, lest any business arise among the people. And when he was in
Bethanie, in the house of Simon the leper, even as he sat at meat, there came
a woman having an Alabaster box of cyntment, called Nard, that was pure and
costly, and she brake the box, and powered it upon his head. And there were
some that were not content within themselves, and said, What needed this wast
of ointment? for it might have been sold for more then three hundred pence,
and have been given to the poor: and they grudged against her. And Jesus said,
Let her alone, why trouble ye her? She has done a good work on me: for ye
have poor with you always, and whenever ye will, ye may do them good:
but me have ye not always. She has done that she could, she came aforehand
to anoint my body to the burying. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this
Gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she has
done, shall be rehearsed in remembrance of her. And Judas Iscariot, one of the
twelve, went away unto the high Priests to betray him unto them. When they
heard that, they were glad, and promised that they would give him money. And
he sought how he might conveniently betray him. And the first day of sweet
bread (When they offered the Passover) his disciples said unto him, Where will thou that we go and prepare that thou may eat the Passover? And he sent
forth two of his disciples, and said unto them, Go ye into the City, and
there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water, follow him. And
whithersoeuer he goes in, say ye unto the good man of the house, The Master
says, Where is the ghest chamber, where I shall eat the Passover with my
disciples? And he will show you a great parlour paued and prepared, there make
ready for us. And his disciples went forth and came into the City, and found
as he had said unto them, and they made ready the Passover. And when it was
now euentide, he came with the twelve: and as they sat at board, and did eat,
Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, one of you (that eats with me) shall
betray me. And they began to be sorry, and to say to him one by one, Is it I:
And another said, Is it I: He answered, and said unto them, It is one of the
twelve, even he that dippeth with me in the platter. The son of man truly
goes as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the son of man
is betrayed: good were it for that man if he had never been borne. And as they
did eat, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and
gave to them, and said Take, eat, this is my body. And he took the cup, and
when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it. And
he said unto them, This is my blood of the new Testament, which is shed for
many. Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the Vine,
until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. And when they had
said grace, they went out to the mount Oliuet. And Jesus says unto them, All
ye shall be offended because of me this night: For it is written, I will
finite the sheepeheard, and the sheep shall be scattered: but after that I am
risen again, I will go into Galilee before you. Peter said unto him, And
though all men be offended, yet will not I. And Jesus says unto him, Verily I
say unto thee, that this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice,
thou shall deny me three times. But he spoke more vehemently, No, if I should
die with thee, I will not deny thee. Likewise also said they all. And they came
to a place which was named Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, Sit ye
here, while I go aside and pray. And he takes with him Peter, and James and
John, and began to ware abashed, and to be in an agony, and said unto them, My
soul heavy, even unto the death: tarry ye here, and watch. And he went forth
a little, and fell down flat on the ground, and prayed, that if it were
possible the hour might pass from him. And he said, Abba, Father, al things
are possible unto thee, take away this cup from me: nevertheless, not as I
will, but that thou will, be done. And he came and found them sleeping, and
faieth to Peter, Simon sleep thou^ Could not thou watch one hour? Watch
ye, and pray, least ye enter into temptation: the spirit truly is ready, but
the flesh is weak. And again he went aside, and prayed, and spoke the same
words. And he returned and found them asleep again, for their eyes were
heavy, neither wist they what to answer him. And he came the third time, and
said to them. Sleep henceforth, and take your ease: it is enough. The hour
is come, behold, the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise
up, let us go: lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand. And immediately while he
yet spoke, comes Judas (which was one of the twelve) and with him a great
number of people, with swords and staves, from the high Priests, and Scribes,
and Elders. And he that betrayed him, had given them a general token, saying,
Whomsoever I do kiss, the same is he, take and lead him away warily. And
as soon as he was come, he goes straight way to him, and says unto him,
Master, Master, and kissed him. And they laid their hands on him, and took
him. And one of them that stood by drew out a sword, and smote a servant of
the high Priests, and cut off his ear. And Jesus answered and said unto them,
Ye be come out as unto a thief with swords and staves, for to take me: I
was daily with you in the Temple teaching, and ye took me not: But these
things come to pass, that the Scriptures should be fulfilled. And they all
forsook him, and ran away. And there followed him a certain young man
clothed in linen upon the bare, and the young men caught him, and he left his
linen garment, and fled from them naked. And they led Jesus away to the high
Priest of all, and with him came all the high Priests, and the Eldres, and the
Scribes. And Peter followed him a great way off (even till he was come into
the palace of the high Priest) and he sat with the servants, and warmed
himself at the fire. And the hie Priests and all the counsel sought for
witness againtst Jesus to put him to death, and found none: for many bare
false witness against him, but their witnesses agreed not together. And there
arose certain, and brought false witness against him, saying, We heard say, I
will destroy this Temple that is made with hands, and within three days I
will build another made without hand: But yet their witnesses agreed not
together. And the high Priest stood up among them, and asked Jesus, saying,
Answerest thou nothing? How is it that these bear witness against thee: But
he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the hie Priest asked him, and
said unto him, Art thou Christ the son of the Blessed: And Jesus said, I am:
and ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and
coming in the clouds of heaven. Then the hie Priest rent his clothes, and
said, What need we any further witnesses? ye have heard blasphemy, what
think ye? And they all condemned him to be worthy of death. And some began
to spit at him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to say
unto him, Aread. And the servants buffeted him on the face. And as Peter was be
neath in the palace, there came one of the wenches of the hie Priest, and when
she saw Peter warming himself, she looked on him, and said, Wast not thou also
with Jesus of Nazareth? And he denied, saying, I know him not, neither wot I
what thou say. And he went out into the porch, and the cock crew. And a
Damosel (when she saw him) began again to say to them that stood by, This is
one of them. And he denied it again. And anon after, they that stood by, said
again unto Peter, Surely thou art one of them, for thou art of Galile, and thy
speech agrees thereto. But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not
this man of whom ye speak. And again the cock crew. And Peter remembered the
word that Jesus had said unto him, Before the Cock crow twice, thou shall
deny me three times: and he began to weep.

Tuesday before Easter.
The Epistle.
THe Lord God has opened mine ear, Esa. 50.1.
therefore can I not say nay, neither withdraw my self: but I offer back unto
the smiters, and my cheeks to the nippers. I turn not my face from shame and
spitting, and the Lord God shall help me: therefore shall I not be confounded.
I have hardeued my face like a flint stone, for I am sure that I shall not come
to confusion. He is at hand that justifies me: who will then go to law with
me? Let us stand one against another. If there be any that will reason with me,
let him come here forth to me. Behold, the Lord God stands by me: What is
he then that can condemn me? Lo, they shall be like as an old cloth, the
moth shall eat them up. Therefore who so fears the Lord among you, let him
hear the voice of his servant. Who so walks in darkness, and no light
shines upon him, let him put his trust in the name of the Lord, and hold him
up by his God. But take heed, ye all kindle a fire of the wrath of God, and
stir up the coals, Walk on in the glistering of your own fire, and in the
coals that ye have kindled. This comes unto you from my hand, namely that ye
shall sleep in sorrow.

The Gospel.
ANd anon in the dawning the high Priests held a counsel with the Elders,
Mar. 15.1
and the Scribes, and the whole congregation, and bound Jesus and led him away,
and delivered him to Pilate. And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the
Iewes^ And he answered, and said unto him, Thou say it. And the high
Priests accused him of many things. So Pilate asked him again, saying,
Answerest thou nothing? Behold, how many things they lay to thy charge. Jesus
answered yet nothing, so that Pilate marueiled. At that feast Pilate did
deliver unto them a Prisoner, whomsoever they would desire. And there was one
that was named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that made insurrection: he
had committed murder. And the people called unto him, and began to desire, him
that he would do acording as he had ever done unto them. Pilate answered them,
saying Will ye that I let loose unto you the King of the Jews? For he knew
that the hie Priests had delivered him of envy. But the high Priests moved
the people, that he should rather deliver Barabbas unto them. Pilate answered
again, and said unto them, What will ye then that I do unto him, whom ye
call the King of the Jews? And they cried again, Crucify him. Pilate said
unto them, What evil has he done: And they cried the more fervently, Crucify
him. And so Pilate willing to content the people, let loose Barabbas unto them,
and delieured up Jesus (when he had scourged him) for to be crucified. And the
soldiers led him away into the common hall, and called together the whole
multitude. And they clothed him with purple, and they platted a crown of
thorns, and crowned him withal, and began to salute him, Hail King of the
Jews. And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and
bowed their knees, and worshipped him. And when they had mocked him, they took
the purple often him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to
crucify him. And they compelled one that passed by, called Simon of Cyrene
(the father of Alexander and Rufus) which came out of the field, to bear his
cross. And they brought him to a place named Golgotha, (which if a man
interpret, is, the place of dead men's skuls.) And they gave him drink, wine
mingled with myrrh: but he received it not. And when they had crucified him,
they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
And it was about the third hour, and they crucified him, and the title of his
cause was written, The King of the Jews. And they crucified with him two
thieues, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left: And the
Scripture was fulfilled, which says, He was counted among the wicked. And
they that went by, railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, A wretch,
thou that destroyest the Temple, and buildest it again in three days, save
thy self, and come down from the cross. Likewise also mocked him the high
Priests among themselves, with the Scribes, and said, He saved other men,
himself he cannot save. Let Christ the king of Israel descend now from the
cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him,
checked him also. And when the sixth hour was come, darkness arose over all
the earth, until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a
loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, Iamasabachthani, which is (if one interpret it)
My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? And some of them that stood by, when
they heard that, said, Behold, he calls for Elias. And one ran and filled a
sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying,
Let him alone, let us see whether Elias will come and take him down. But Jesus
cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. And the veil of the Temple
rent in two pieces, from the top to the bottom. And when the Centurion (which
stood before him) saw that he so cried, and gave by the ghost, he said,
Truly this man was the Son of GOD. There were also women a good way off,
beholding him: Among whom was Marie Magdalene, and Marie the mother of James
the little, and of Ioses, and Marie Salome (which also when he was in Galilee,
had followed him, and ministered unto him) and many other women, which came up
with him to Hierusalam. And now when the even was come, (because it was the day
of preparing that goes before the Sabbath) Joseph of the city of Arimathea, a
noble counsailour, which also looked for the kingdom of God, came and went in
boldly unto Pilate, and begged of him the body of Jesus. And Pilate marueiled
that he was already dead, and called unto him the Centurion, and asked of him
whether he had been any while dead. And when he knew the truth of the
Centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. And he bought a linen cloth, and took
him down, and wrapped him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a sepulcher
that was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone before the door of the
sepulcher. And Mary Magdalene, and Mary Ioses beheld where he was laid.

Wednesday before Easter.
The Epistle.
WHere as is a Testament, Heb. 9.16.
there must also (of necessity) be the death of him that makes the Testament.
For the testament takes authority when men are dead: For it is yet of no
value, as long as he that makes the Testament is alive. For which cause also,
neither the first Testament was ordained without blood. For when Moses had
declared al ye co^mandeme^ts to all the people, according to the Law, he took
the blood of Calves and of Goats, with water and purple wool, and hysoye, and
sprinkled both the book and all the people, saying, This is the blood of the
Testament which God has appointed unto you. Moreover, he sprinkled the
tabernacle with blood also, and all the ministering vessels. And almost all things
are by the Law purged with blood, and without shedding of blood is no
remission. It is need then that the similitudes of heavenly things be purified
with such things, but that the heavenly things themselves be purified with
better sacrifices then are those. For Christ is not entered into the holy
places that are made with hands, (which are similitudes of true things) but is
entered into very heaven, for to appear now in the sight of God for us, not to
offer him self often, as the high Priest enters into the holy place every
year with strange blood, (for then he must have often suffered since the world
began) but now in the end of the world has he appeared once, to put sin to
flight, by the offering up of himself. And as it is appointed unto all men that
they shall once die, and then comes the judgment: even so Christ was once
offered to take away the sins of many, and unto them that look for him, shall
he appear again without sin, unto salvation.

The Gospel.
THe feast of sweet bread drew nigh, Luke 22.1.
which is called Easter, and the hie Priests and Scribes sought how they might
kill him, for they feared the people. Then entered Satan into Judas, whose
surname was Iscariot, which was of the number of the twelve, and he went his
way, and communed with the hie priests and officers, how he might betray him
unto them. And they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he
consented, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them, when the people
were away. Then came the day of sweet bread, when of necessity the Passover
must be offered. And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the
Passover, that we may eat. They said unto him, Where will thou that we
prepare? And he said unto them, Behold, when ye enter into the City, there
shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water, him follow into the same
house that he enters in, and ye shall say unto the goodman of the house,
The master says unto thee, Where is the ghest chamber, where I shall eat the
Passover with my Disciples? And he shall show you a great parlour paued,
there make ready. And they went, and found as he had said unto them. and they
made ready the Passover. And when the hour was come, he fate down, and the
twelve Apostles with him. And he said unto them, I have inwardly desired to
eat this Passover with you before that I suffer. For I say unto you,
henceforth will I not eat of it any more, until it be fulfilled in the
kingdom of God. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said. Take this,
and divide it among you: for I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of
the Vine, until the kingdom of God come. And he took bread, and when he had
given thanks, he brake it, and gave it unto them, saying, This is my body which
is given for you: this do in the remembrance of me. Likewise also when he had
supped, he took the cup, saying, This cup is the new Testament in my blood,
which is shed for you. Yet behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me, is with
me on the table. And truly the Son of man goes as it is appointed: but woe
unto that man by whom he is betrayed. And they began to enquire among
themselves, which of them it was that should do it. And there was a strife
among them, which of them should seem to be the greatest. And he said unto
them, The kings of nations reign over them, and they that have anthoritie upon
them, are called gracious: but ye shall not so be. But he that is greatest
among you, shall be as the younger: and he that is chief, shall be as he that
does minister. For whether is greater, he that sits at meat? or he that
serves: Is not he that sits at meat? But I am among you as he that
ministers. Ye are they which have abidden with me in my temptations. And I
appoint unto you a kingdom, as my father has appointed to me, that ye may
eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on seats judging the
twelve tribes of Israel. And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has
desired to sift you, as it were wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy
faith fail not. And when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. And he
said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee into prison, and to death. And
he said, I tell thee Peter, the Cock shall not crow this day, till thou have
denied thrice that thou know me. And he said unto them, When I sent you
without wallet, and scrip, and shoes, lacked you any thing? And they said, No.
Then said he unto them, But now he that has a wallet, let him take it up, and
likewise his scrip, and he that has no sword, let him sell his coat and buy
one. For I say unto you, that yet the same which is written, must be performed
in me, Even among the wicked was he reputed: for those things which are
written of me, have an end. And they said, Lord, behold, here are two
swords. And he said unto them, It is enough. And he came out, and went (as
he was wont) to mount Oliuet. And the Disciples followed him: and when he
came to the place, he said unto them, Pray, left ye fall into temptation. And
he gate himself from them about a stones cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,
saying, Father, if thou will, remove this cup from me: nevertheless, not my
will, but thine be fulfilled. And there appeared an Angel unto him from heaven,
comforting him. And he was in an agony, and prayed the longer, and his sweat
was like drops of blood, trickling down to the ground. And when he arose
from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for
heaviness, and he said unto them, Why sleep ye? Rise, and pray, left ye fall
into temptation. While he yet spoke, behold, there came a company and he that
was called Judas, oue of the twelve, went before them, and preassed nigh unto
Jesus to kiss him. But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the son of
man with a kiss? When they which were about him, saw what would follow, they
said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? And one of them smote a
servant of the high Priests, and struck off his right ear. Jesus answered,
and said, Suffer ye thus far forth. And when he touched his ear, he healed
him. Then Jesus said unto the high Priests and Rulers of the Temple, and the
Elders which were come to him. Ye be come out as unto a thief, with swords
and staves. When I was daily with you in the Temple, ye stretched forth no
hands against me: But this is even your very hour, and the power of
darkness. Then took they him, and led him, and brought him to the high
Priests house. But Peter followed a far off. And when they had kindled a
fire in the mids of the palace, and were set down together, Peter also sat
down among them. But when one of the wenches beheld him, as he sat by the
fire, and looked upon him, she said, This same fellow was also with him. And he
denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. And after a little while, another
saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. And
about the space of an hour after, another affirmed, saying, Verily this fellow
was with him also, for he is of Galilee. And Peter said, Man, I wot not what
thou say. And immediately while he yet spoke, the Cock crewe. And the
Lord turned back and looked upon Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the
Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the Cock crow, thou shall deny me
thrice: And Peter went out, and wept bitterly. And the men that took Jesus,
mocked him, and smote him: And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him
on the face, and asked him, saying Areede, who is he that smote thee? And many
other things despitefully said they against him. And as soon as it was day, the
Elders of the people, and the high Priests, and Scribes came together, ahd led
him into their council, saying, Art thou very Christ? Tell us. And he said
unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe me: and if I ask you, you will
not answer, nor let me go. Hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right
hand of the power of God. Then said they all, Art thou then the son of God?
He said, Ye say that I am. And they said, What need we of any further witness?
for we our selves have heard of his own mouth.

Thursday before Easter.
The Epistle.
THis I warn you of, 1. Cor. 11.17.
and commend not, that ye come not together after a better manner, but after a
worse. For first of all, when ye come together in the congregation, I hear
that there is dissension among you, and I partly believe it. For there must be
sects among you, that they which are perfect among you, may be known. When
ye come together therefore into one place, the Lords Supper cannot be eaten,
for every man begins before to cate his own Supper, and one is hungry, and
another is drunken. Have ye not houses to eat and drink in? Despise ye the
congregation of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say unto you?
Shall I praise you? In this I praise you not. That which I delivered unto you;
I received of the Lord. For the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was
betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said,
Take ye, and eat, this is my body which is broken for you: This do ye in the
remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup when supper was
done, saying, This cup is the new Testament in my blood: This do, as often as ye
drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as ye shall eat this bread, and
drink of this cup ye shall show the Lords death till he come. Wherefore,
whosoever shall eat of this bread, and drink of this cup of the Lord
unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man
examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup. For
he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks his own damnation,
because he makes no difference of the Lords body. For this cause many are weak
and sick among you, and many sleep. For if we had judged our selves, we
should not have been judged. But when we are judged of the Lord, we are
chastened, that we should not be damned with the world. Wherefore, my brethren,
when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another. If any man hunger, let
him eat at home, that ye come not together unto condemnation. Other things
will I set in order when I come.

The Gospel.
THe whole multitude of them arose, Luke 23.1.
and led him unto Pilate. And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this
fellow perverting the people, and forbidding to pay tribute to Caesar, saying
that he is Christ a King. And Pilate apposed him, saying, Art thou the King of
the Jews? He answered him, and said, Thou say it. Then said Pilate to the
hie Priests, and to the people, I find no fault in this man. And they were the
more fierce, saying, He moves the people, teaching thorowout all Jury, and
began at Galilee, even to this place. When Pilate heard mention of Galilee, he
asked whether the man were of Galilee. And as soon as he knew that he belonged
unto Herod's Jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, which was also at Jerusalem
at that time. And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was
desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him,
and he trusted to have seen some miracles done by him. Then he questioned with
him many words: but he answered him nothing. The high Priests and Scribes stood
forth, and accused him straightly. And Herod with his men of war despised
him. And when he had mocked him, he arrayed him in white clothing, and sent
him again to Pilate. And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends
together: for before they were at variance. And Pilate called together the high
Priests, and the Rulers, and the people, and said unto them, Ye have brought
this man unto me, as one that peruerteth the people, and behold, I examine him
before you, and find no fault in this man of those things whereof ye accuse
him, no nor yet Herod. For I sent you unto him, and lo, nothing worthy of
death is done unto him: I will therefore chasten him, and let him loose. For of
necessity he must have let one loose to them at that feast. And all the
people cried at once, saying, Away with him, and deliver us Barabbas (which for
a certain insurrection made in the city, and for a murder, was cast into
prison.) Pilate spoke again unto them, willing to let Jesus loose. But they
cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. He said unto them the third time,
What evil has he done? I find no cause of death in him: I will therefore
chasten him, and let him go. And they cried with loud voices requiring that he
might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the high Priests prevailed.
And Pilate gave sentence, that it should be as they required: and he let
loose unto them him, that for insurrection and murder was cast into prison,
whom they had desired. And he delivered to them Jesus, to do with him what
they would. And as they led him away, they caught one Simon of Cyrene coming
out of the field, and on him laid they the Cross, that he might bear it
after Jesus. And there followed him a great company of people, and of women,
which bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus turned back unto them, and said,
Ye daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for your selves, and
for your children: For behold, the days will come, in the which they shall
say, Happy are the barren, and the wombes that never bare, and the pappes
which never gave suck. Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on
us: and to the hills, Cover us. For if they do this in a green tree, what
shall be done in the dry? And there were two evil doers led with him to be
slain. And after that they were come to the place, which is called Caluarie,
there they crucified him, and the evil doers, one on the right hand, and the
other on the left. Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them, for they wot not what
they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots: and the people stood and
beheld. And the Rulers mocked him with them, saying, He saved other men, let
him save himself, if he be very Christ the chosen of God. The soldiers also
mocked him, and came and offered him vinegar, and said, If thou be the King of
the Jews, save thy self. And a superscription was written over him with
letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrewe, This is the King of the Jews. And
one of the evil doers which were hanged, rayled on him, saying, If thou be
Christ, save thy self and us. But the other answered, and rebuked him, saying,
Fear not thou GOD, seeing thou art in the same damnation? We are
righteously punished, for we receive according to our deeds: but this man
has done nothing amiss. And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me, when
thou come into thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto
thee, to day shall thou be with me in Paradise. And it was about the sixth
hour: and there was a darkness over all the earth, until the ninth hour,
and the Sun was darkened, and the veil of the Temple did rent, even through
the mids. And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into
thy hands I commend my spirit. And when he thus had said, he gave up the
ghost. When the Centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying,
Verily this was a righteous man. And all the people that came together to that
sight, and saw the things which had happened, smote their breasts, and
returned. And all his acquaintance, and the women that follwed him from
Galilee, stood a far off, beholding these things. And behold, there was a man
named Joseph, a counsailor, and he was a good man, and a just: the same had not
consented to the counsel and deed of them, which was of Arimathea, a city of
the Jews, which same also waited for the kingdom of God: he went unto Pilate,
and begged the body of Jesus, and took it down, and wrapped it in a linen
cloth, and laid it in a Sepulcher that was hewn in stone, wherein never man
before had been laid. And that day was the preparing of the Sabbath, and the
Sabbath drew on. The women that followed after, which had come with him from
Galilee, beheld the sepulcher, and how his body was laid. And they returned,
and prepared sweet odours, and ointments: but rested on the Sabbath day,
according to the commandment.

On good Friday.
The Collect.
Almighty God, we beseech thee graciously to behold this thy family, for the
which our Lord Jesus Christ was contented to be betrayed, and given up into the
hands of wicked men, and to suffer death upon the cross, who lives, and
reigns, etc.

Almighty and everlasting God, by whose spirit the whole body of the Church
is governed and sanctified: Receive our supplications and prayers, which we
offer before thee for all estates of men in thy holy congregation, that every
member of the same in his vocation and ministry, may truly and godly serve
thee, through our Lord Jesus Christ.

Merciful God, who have made all men, and hate nothing that thou have made,
nor would the death of a sinner, but rather that he should be converted and
live, have mercy upon all Jews, Turks, Infidels, and Heretics, and take
from them all ignorance, hardness of heart, and contempt of thy word: and so
fetch them home, blessed Lord, to thy flock, that they may be saved among the
remnant of the true Israelites, and be made one sold under one shepherd,
Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns, etc.

The Epistle.
THe Law (which has but a shadow of good things to come, Heb. 10.1.
and not the very fashion of things themselves) can never with those
sacrifices which they offer year by year continually, make the comers
thereunto perfect. For would not then those sacrifices have ceased to have
been offered, because that the offerers once purged, should have had no more
conscience of sins? Nevertheless, in those sacrifices is there mention made
of sins every year. For the blood of Oxen and Goats cannot take away
sins. Wherefore when he comes into the world, he says, Sacrifice and
offering thou would not have, but a body have thou ordained me, Burnt
offering also for sin have thou not allowed. Then said I Lo, I am here. In
the beginning of the book it is written of me, that I should do thy will, O
God. Above, when he says, Sacrifice and offering, and burnt sacrifices, and
sin offerings thou would not have, neither have thou allowed them (which
yet are offered by the Law:) Then said he, Lo, I am here to do thy will, O
God: he takes away the first, to establish the latter, By the which will we
are made holy, even by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
And every Priest is ready daily ministering, and offering oftentimes one manner
of oblation, which can never take away sins. But this man, after he had
offered one sacrifice for sins, is set down for ever on the right hand of
God, and from henceforth tarieth till his foes be made his footestoole. For
with one offering has he made perfect for ever them that are santified. The
holy Ghost himself also bears us record, even when he told before, This is
the Testament that I will make unto them: After those days (says the Lord) I
will put my laws in their hearts, and in their minds will I write them, and
their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. And where remission of
these things is, there is no more offering for sins. Seeing therefore
brethren, that by the means of the blood of Jesus, we have liberty so enter
into the holy place, by the new and living way, which he has prepared for us
through the veil (that is to say) by his flesh: And seeing also that we have
an high Priest, which is ruler over the house of GOD, let us draw nigh with a
true heart in sure faith, sprinkled in our hearts from an evil conscience, and
washed in our bodies with pure water. Let us keep the profession of our hope
without wavering (for he is faithful that promised) and let us consider one
another, to the intent that we may provoke unto love, and to good works, not
forsaking the fellowship that we have among our selves, as the manner of some
is: but let us exhort one another, and that so much the more, because ye see
that the day draws nigh.

The Gospel.
WHen Jesus had spoken these words, Ioh. 18.1.
he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden,
into the which he then entered with his disciples. Judas also which betrayed
him, knew the place. For Jesus oftimes resorted thither with his disciples.
Judas then (after he had received a band of men, and ministers of the high
Priests and Pharisees) came thither with lanternes, and firebrands, and
weapons. And Jesus knowing all things that should come on him, went forth, and
said unto them, Whom seek ye? They ansswered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus
said unto them, I am he. Judas also which betrayed him, stood with them.
As Soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to
the ground. Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? They said, Jesus of
Nazareth. Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if ye seek me
therefore, let these go their way, that the saying might be fulfilled which he
spoke, Of them which thou gave me, have I not lost one. Then Simon Peter
having a sword, drew it, and smote the high Priests servant, and cut off his
right ear. The servants name was Malchus. Therefore says Jesus unto Peter,
Put up thy sword into the sheath: shall I not drink of the cup which my father
has given me? Then the company, and the captain, and the ministers of the
Jews took Jesus and bound him, and led him away to Annas first, for he was
father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high Priest the same year. Caiaphas
was he that gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man
should die for the people. And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another
disciple: That disciple was known to the high Priest, and went in with Jesus
into the palace of the high Priest. But Peter stood at the door without. Then
went out that other Disciple (which was known to the high Priest) and spoke to
the Damsel that kept the door, and brought in Peter. Then said the Damsel
that kept the door, unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's Disciples?
He said, I am not. The servant and ministers stood there, which had made a
fire of coals, for it was cold, and they warmed themselves. Peter also stood
among them, and warmed himself. The high Priest then asked Jesus of his
Disciples, and of his doctrine. Jesus answered him, I spoke openly in the
world, I ever taught in the Synagogue, and in the Temple, whither all the Jews
have resorted, and in secret have I spoken nothing. Why ask thou me? Ask
them which heared me, What I said unto them: Behold, they can tell what I
said. When he had thus spoken, one of the ministers which stood by, smote
Jesus on the face, saying, Answerest thou the high Priest so? Jesus answered
him, If I have evil spoken, bear witness of the evil: but if I have well
spoken, why smitest thou me? And Annas sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high
Priest. Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. Then said they unto him, Art
not thou also one of his Disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not. One of
the servants of the high Priest (his cousin whose ear Peter smote off) said
unto him, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? Peter therefore denied
again, and immediately the Cock crewe. Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas,
into the hall of judgment: It was in the morning, and they themselves went not
into the judgment hall, least they should be defiled, but that they might
eat the Passover. Pilate then went out to them, and said, What accusation
bring you against this man? They answered and said unto him, If he were not an
evil doer, we would not have delivered him unto thee. Then said Pilate unto
them, Take ye him, and judge him after your own law. The Jews therefore
said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: that the
words of Jesus might be fulfilled which he spoke, signifying what death he
should die. Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called
Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? Jesus answered,
Say thou that of thy self, or did other tell it thee of me? Pilate
answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation, and high Priests have delivered thee
unto me: what have thou done? Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world.
If my kingdom were of this world, then would my ministers surely fight, that I
should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.
Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou
say that I am a king. For this cause was I borne, and for this cause came I
into the world, that I should be are witness unto the truth: And all that are
of the truth, hear my voice. Pilate said unto him, What thing is truth? And
when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and said unto
them, I find in him no cause at all. Ye have a custom that I should deliver
you one loose at Easter: will ye that I loose unto you the king of the Jews:
Then cried they all again, saying, Not him, but Barabbas: The same Barabbas
was a murderer, Then Pilate took Jesus therefore, and scourged him: and the
soldiers wound a crown of thorns, and put it on his head. And they did on
him a purple garment, and came unto him, and said, Hail King of the Jews:
and they smote him on the face. Pilate went forth again and said unto them,
Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in
him. Then came Jesus forth, wearing a crown of thorn, and a robe of purple.
And he says unto them, Behold the man. When the high Priests therefore and the
ministers saw him, they cried, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate says unto
them, Take ye him, and crucify him. for I find no cause in him. The Jews
answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made
himself the Son of God. When Pilate heard that saying; he was the more
afraid, and went again into the Judgment hall, and said unto Jesus, Whence
art thou? But Jesus gave him none answer. Then said Pilate unto him, Speak
thou not unto me? Know thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and
have power to loose thee? Jesus answered, Thou could have no power at all
against me, except it were given thee from above. Therefore he that delivered
me unto thee, has the more sin. And from thencefoorth sought Pilate means
to loose him. But the Jews cried, saying, If thou let him go, thou art not
Cesars friend: for whosoever makes himself a King, is against Caesar. When
Pilate heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down to give
sentence, in a place that is called the pauement, but in the Hebrewe tongue,
Gabbatha. It was the preparing day of Easter, about the sixth hour. And he
says unto the Jews, Behold your King. They cried, saying, Away with him,
away with him, crucify him. Pilate says unto them, Shall I crucify your
king? The high Priests answered, We have no king but Ceasar. Then delivered.
he him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away. And he
bare his cross, and went forth into a place which is called the place of dead
men's skuls, but in Hebrewe Golgotha, where they crucified him, and two other
with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst. And Pilate wrote a
title, and put it upon the cross. The writing was, Jesus of Nazareth, King of
the Jews. This title read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was
crucified, was near to the city. And it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and
Latin. Then said the high priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, King of
the Jews: but that he said, I am king of the Jews. Pilate answered, What I
have written, that I have written. Then the soldiers, when they had crucified
Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldiers a part,
and also his coat. The coat was without seame, wrought upon throughout. They
said therefore among themselves, Let us not divide it, but cast lots for it,
who shall have it, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, saying, They have
parted my raiment among them, and for my coat did they cast lots. And the
soldiers did such things in deed. There stood by the cross of Jesus his
mother, and his mothers sister, Marie the wife of Cleophas, and Marie
Magdalene. When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved
standing, he says unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son. Then said he to
the disciple, Bhold mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her for his
own. After these things, Jesus knowing that all things were now performed,
that the Scripture might be fulfilled, he says, I thirst. So there stood a
vessel by, full of vinegar: therefore they filled a sponge with vinegar, and
wound it about with hysope, and put it to his mouth. As Soon as Jesus then
received the vinegar, he said, It is finished, and bowed his head, and gave
up the ghost. The Jews therefore, because it was the preparing of the Sabbath,
that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath day (for that
Sabbath day was an high day) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken,
and that they might be taken down. Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs
of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him. But when they came
to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: but one
of the soldiers with a spear thrust him into the side, and forthwith there
came out blood and water. And he that saw it, bare record, and his record is
true. And he knows that he says true, that ye might believe also. For these
things were done, that the Scripture should be fulfilled, Ye shall not break a
bone of him. And again another Scripture says, They shall look upon him
whom they have pierced. After this, Joseph of Arumathea (which was a Disciple
of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews) besought Pilate that he might
take down the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave him license. He came therefore
and took the body of Jesus. And there came also Nicodemus (which at the
beginning came to Jesus by night) and brought of myrrh and aloes mingled
together, about an hundredth pound weight. Then took they the body of Jesus,
and wound it in linen clothes with the odours, as the manner of the Jews is to
bury. And in the place where he was crucified there was agarden, and in the
garden a new sepulcher, wherein was never man laid. There laid they Jesus
therefore, because of the preparing of the Sabbath of the Jews, for the
sepulcher was nigh at hand.

Easter Even.
The Epistle.
IT is better (if the will of God be so) that ye suffer for well doing, 1. Pet.
3, 27.
then for evil doing: forasmuch as Christ has once suffered for sins, the just
for the unjust, to bring us to God, and was killed as perteining to the flesh,
but was quickened in the spirit. In which spirit he also went and preached to
the spirits that were in prison, which sometime had been disobedient, when the
long suffering of God was once looked for in the days of Noe, while the Arc
was a preparing: wherein a few, that is to say, eight souls, were saved by
the water, like as Baptism also now saves us: not the putting away of the
filth of the flesh, but in that a good conscience conseuteth to God, by the
resurrection of Jesus Christ, which is on the right hand of God, and is gone
into heaven, angels, powers, and might, subdued unto him.

The Gospel.
WHEN the even was come, Matt. 27.57.
there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, which also was Jesus
disciple. He went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate
commanded the body to be delivered. And when Joseph had taken the body, he
wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his new tomb, which he
had hewn out even in the rock, and rolled a great stone to the door of the
sepulcher, and departed. And there was Marie Magdalene, and the other Marie
sitting over against the sepulcher. The next day that follows the day of
preparing, the high Priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, saying,
Sir, we remember that this deceiuer said, while he was yet alive, After three
days I will rise again. Command therefore that the sepulcher be made sure
until the third day, least his Disciples come and steal him away, and say
unto the people, He is risen from the dead: and the last error shall be worse
then the first. Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it
as sure as ye can. So they went, and made the sepulcher sure with the
watchmen, and sealed the stone.

Easter day.
At Morning prayer, in stead of the Psalm, O come let us, etc. these Anthemes
shall be sung or said.
CHrist rising again from the dead, now dies not. Death from henceforth has
no power upon him. For in that he dyed, he dyed but once to put away sin: but
in that he lives, he lives unto God. And so likewise, count your selves dead
unto sin, but living unto God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

CHrist is risen again, the first fruits of them that sleep. For seeing that
by man came death, by man also comes the resurrection of the dead. For as by
Adam all men do die: so by Christ all men shall be restored to life.

The Collect.
Almighty God, Which through thy only begotten son Jesus Christ have
overcome death, and opened unto us the gate of everlasting life, we humbly
beseech thee, that as by thy special grace preventing us, thou do put in our
minds good desires: so by thy continual help we may bring the same to good
effect, through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives, etc.

The Epistle.
IF ye be risen again with Christ, Col. 3.^^.
seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of
God. Set your affection on heavenly things, and not on earthly things. For ye
are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. Whenever Christ (which is
our life) shall show himself, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.
Mortify therefore your earthly members, fornication, uncleanness, unnatural
lust, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is worshipping of idols:
for which things sake, the wrath of GOD uses to come on the children of
unbelief, among whom ye walked sometime, when ye lived in them.

The Gospel.
THE first day of the Sabboths came Marie Magdalene early (when it was yet
dark) unto the sepulcher, Ioh. 20.1.
and saw the stone taken away from the grave. Then she ran, and came to Simon
Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and says unto them, They
have taken away the Lord out of the grave, and we cannot tell where they have
laid him. Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came unto
the sepulcher. They ran both together, and that other disciple did outrunne
Peter, and came first to the sepulcher. And when he had stonped down, he saw
the linen clothes lying, yet went he not in. Then came Simon Peter following
him, and went into the sepulcher, and saw the linen clothes lie, and the
napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped
together in a place by it self. Then went in also that other disciple, which
came first to the sepulcher, and he saw, and believed: for as yet they knew not
the Scripture that he should rise again from death. Then the disciples went
away again to their own home.

Monday in Easter week.
The Collect.
Almighty God, which through the only begotten son Jesus Christ have
overcome death, and opened unto us the gate of everlasting life: We humbly
beseech thee, that as by thy special grace preue^ting us, thou do put in our
minds good desires: so by thy continual help we may bring the same to good
effect, through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns, etc.

The Epistle.
PEter opened his mouth, Acts 10.34.
and said, Of a truth I perceive that there is no respect of persons with God:
but in all people he that fears him, and works righteousness, is accepted
with him. Ye know the preaching that God sent unto the children of Israel,
preaching peace by Jesus Christ, which is Lord over al things. Which preaching
was published throghout all Jury (and began in Galilee, after the baptism
which John preached) how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the holy Ghost,
and with power: which Jesus went about, doing good, and healing all that were
oppressed of the devil: for God was with him. And we are witnesses of al
things which he did in the land of the Jews, and at Jerusalem, whom they
flew and hanged on tree. Him God raised up the third day, and showed him
openly, not to all the people, but to us witnesses (chosen before of God for the
same intent) which did eat and drink with him after he rose from death. And
he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which
was ordained of God to be the judge of the quick and the dead. To him give all the Prophets witnesss, that through his Name, whosoever believes in him, shall
receive remission of sins.

The Gospel.
Behold, Luke 24.13
two of his Disciples went that same day to a town called Emmaus, which was
from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs, and they talked together of all the
things that had happened. And it chanced, while they communed together and
reasoned, Jesus himself drew near and went with them: but their eyes were
holden that they should not know him. And he said unto them, What manner of
communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad?
And one of them (whose name was Cleophas) answered, and said unto him, Art thou
only a stranger in Jerusalem, and have not known the things which have
chanted there in these days? He said unto them, What things? and they said
unto him, of Jesus Of Nazareth, which was a Prophet, mighty in deed and word
before God and all the people, and how the high Priests and our rulers
delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him: But we trusted
that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel. And as touching all
these things, to day is even the third day that they were done. Yea, and
certain women also of our company made us astonished, which came early unto
the sepulcher, and found not his body, and came, saying, that they had seen a
vision of Angels, which said that he was alive. And certain of them which
were with us, went to the sepulcher, and found it even so as the women had
said, but him they saw not. And he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart
to believe all that the Prophets have spoken. Ought not Christ to have suffered
these things, and to enter into his glory? And he began at Moses, and all the
Prophets, and interpreted unto them in all Scriptures which were written of him.
And they drew nigh unto the town which they went unto, and he made as though
he would have gone further, and they constrained him, saying, Abide with us,
for it draws toward night, and the day is far passed. And he went in to
tarry with them. And it came to pass, as he fate at meat with them, he took
bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. And their ^ies were opened,
and they knew him: and he vanished out of their sight. And they said between
themselves, Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by the
way, and opened to us the Scriptures? And they rose up the same hour and
returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that
were with them, saying, The Lord is risen in deed, and has appeared unto
Simon. And they told what things were done in the way, and how they knew him in
breaking of bread.

Tuesday in Easter week.
The Collect.
Almighty Father, which have given thine only Son to die for our sins,
and to rise again for our justification: grant us so to put away the leaven
of malice and wickedness, that we may always serve thee in pureness of living
and truth, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
YE men and brethren, Act. 13.26.
children of the generation of Abraham, and whosoever among you fears God, to
you is this word of salvation sent. For the inhabiters of Jerusalem, and their
rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the Prophets, which
are read every Sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him. And
when they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilat to kill him.
And when they had fulfilled all that were written of him, they took him down
from the tree, and put him in a sepulcher. But God raised him again from death
the third day, and he was seen many days of them which went with him from
Galilee to Jerusalem, which are witnesses unto the people. And we declare
unto you, how that the promise which was made unto the Fathers, God has
fulfilled unto their children, even unto us, in that he raised up Jesus again,
even as it is written in the second Psalm, Thou art my son, this day have I
begotten thee. As concerning that he raised him up from death, now no more to
return to corruption, he said on this wife. The holy promises made to David,
will I give faithfully unto you. Wherefore he says also in another place,
Thou shall not suffer thine holy One to see corruption. For David (after that
he had in his time fulfilled the will of God) fell on sleep, and was laid unto
his fathers, and saw corruption. But he whom God raised again saw no
corruption. Be it known unto you therefore (ye men and brethren) that through
this man is preached unto you forgiveness of sins, and that by him all that
believe, are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by
the law of Moses. Beware therefore, lest that fall on you, which is spoken of
in the Prophets, Behold ye despisers, and wonder, and perish ye: For I do a
work in your days, which ye shall not believe, though a man declare it unto
you.

The Gospel.
Jesus stood in the mids of his Disciples, Luke 24.36.
and said unto them, Peace be unto you: It is I, fear not. But they were
abashed and afraid, and supposed that they had seen a Spirit. And he said
unto them, Why are ye troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
Behold my hands and my feet, that it is even I my self: handle me, and see:
for a spirit has no flesh and bones, as ye se me have. And when he had thus
spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet. And while they yet believed not
for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? And they
offered him a piece of a broyled fish, and of an honey comb. And he took it
and did eat before them. And he said unto them, These are the words which I
spoke unto you, while I was yet with you: that all must be fulfilled which
were written of me in the Law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the
Psalms. Then opened he their wits, that they might understand the Scriptures,
and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer,
and to rise again from death the third day, and that repentance and remission
of sins should be preached in his Name among all nations, and must begin at
Jerusalem. And ye are witnesses of these things.

The first Sunday after Easter.
The Collect.
Almighty God, which, etc. (As at the Communion on Easter day.)

The Epistle.
ALl that is borne of God, 1. Ioh. 5.4.
overcomes the world. And this is the victory that overcomes the world,
even our faith. Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes
that Jesus is the Son of God? This Jesus Christ is he that came by water and
blood: not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the spirit that
bears witness, because the spirit is truth. For there are three which bear
record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghost, and these three are
one. And there are three which bear record in earth, the Spirit, and Water,
and Blood, and these three are one. If we receive the witness of men, the
witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God, which he testified
of his Son. He that believes on the Son of God, has the witness in
himself: He that believes not God, has made him a liar, because he believes
not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, how that God
has given unto us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that has
the Son, has life, and he that has not the Son of God, has not life.

The Gospel.
THe same day at night, John 20.19.
which was the first day of the Sabboths, when the doors were shut (where the
disciples were assembled together for fear of the Jews) came Jesus and stood
in the mids, and said unto them, Peace be unto you. And when he had so said,
he showed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad when
they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you. As my
Father sent me, even so send I you also. And when he had said these words, he
breathed on them, and said unto them, Receive ye the holy Ghost. Whosoeuers
sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them, and whosoeuers sins ye
retain, they are retained.

The ij. Sunday after Easter.
The Collect.
ALmighty God, which have given thine only Son to be unto us both a sacrifice
for sin, and also an ensample of godly life, give us the grace that we may
always most thankefully receive that his inestimable benefit, and also daily
endeavor our selves to follow the blessed steps of his most holy life.

The Epistle.
THis is thank worthy, 1. Pet. 2.16.
if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, and suffer wrong undeserved.
For what praise is it, if when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye take it
patiently? But and if when ye do well, ye suffer wrong, and take it
patiently, then is there thank with God: for hereunto verily were ye called.
For Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example that ye should follow
his steps, which did no sin, neither was there guile found in his mouth.
Which when he was reviled reviled not again: when he suffered, he threatened
not, but committed the vengeance to him that judges righteously. Which his
own self bare our sins in his body on the tree, that we being delivered
from sin, should live unto righteousness, by whose stripes ye were healed.
For ye were as sheep going astray, but are now turned unto the Shepheared and
Bishop of your souls.

The Gospel.
CHrist said, John 10.11.
I am the good Shepherd. A good Shepherd gives his life for the sheep. An
hired servant, and he which is not the shepherd, (neither the sheep are his
own) sees the woolfe coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees, and the
woolfe catches and scatters the sheep. The hired servant flees, because
he is an hired servant, and cares not for the sheep. I am the good
Shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. As my Father knows me,
even so know I also my Father. And I give my life for the sheep. And other
sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also must I bring, and they
shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold, and one Shepherd.

The third sunday after Easter.
The Collect.
Almighty God, which show to all men that be in error, the light of thy
truth, to the intent that they may return into the way of righteousness: grant
unto al them that be admitted into the fellowship of Christ's religion, that
they may eschew those things that be coutrary to their profession, and follow
all such things as be agreeable to the same, through our Lord Jesus Christ.

The Epistle.
Dearly beloved, 1. Pet. 2.11.
I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which
fight against the soul, and see that ye have honest conversation among the
Gentiles, that whereas they backbite you as evil doers, they may see your good
works, and praise God in the day of visitation. Submit your selves therefore
every man for the Lords sake, whether it be unto the king, as unto the chief
head, either unto rulers, as unto them that are sent of him for the punishment
of evil doers, but for the laud of them that do well. For so is the will of
God, that with well doing ye may stop the mouths of foolish and ignorant men,
as free and not as having the liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but even
as the servants of God. Honor all men: Love brotherly fellowshippe: Fear God:
Honor the King.

The Gospel.
Jesus said to his disciples, John. 16.16.
After a while ye shall not see me, and again, after awhile ye shall see me,
for I go to the Father. Then said some of his Disciples between themselves,
What is this that he says unto us, After a while shall not see me, and
again, after a while ye shall see me, and that I go to the father? They said
therefore, What is this that he says, After a while? We can not tell what
he says. Jesus perceived that they would ask him, and said unto them. Ye
enquire of this between your selves, because I said, After a while ye shall
not see me, and Again, After a while ye shall see me. Verily, verily I say unto
you, Ye shall weep and lament, but contrariwise the world shall rejoice. Ye
shall sorrow, but your sorrow, shall be tnrned to joy. A woman when the
traueileth, has sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is
delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish for joy that a man
is borne into the world. And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you
again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy shall no man take from you.

The fourth sunday after Easter.
The Collect.
Almighty God, which do make the minds of all faithful men to be of one
will, grant unto thy people, that they may love the thing which thou
command, and desire that which thou do promise, that among the sundry and
manifold changes of the world, our hearts may surely there be fixed, whereas
true joys are to be found, through Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
EVery good gift, Iam. 1.17.
and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of
lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of change. Of his own
will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be the first
fruits of his creatures. Wherefore, dear brethren, let every man be swift to
hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: for the wrath of man works not that
which is righteous before God. Wherefore lay apart all fillthinesse, and
superstuitie of maliciousness, and receive with meekness the word that is
grafted in you, which is able to save your souls.

The Gospel.
Jesus said unto his disciples, Ioh. 16.5.
Now I go my way to him that sent me, and none of you asks me whither I go:
but because I have said such things unto you, your hearts are full of sorrow.
Nevertheless I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away.
For if I go not away, that comforter will not come unto you: but if I depart,
I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will rebuke the world of sin,
and of righteousness, and of judgment. Of sin, because they believe not on
me. Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye shall see me no more.
Of indgement, because the prince of this world is judged already. I have yet
many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them away now. Howbeit, when
he is come, which is the spirit of truth, he will lead you into all truth. He
shall not speak unto himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he
speak, and he will show you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall
receive of mine, and shall show unto you. All things that the Father has, are
mine: therefore said I unto you, that he shall take of mine, and show unto you.

The fifth Sunday after Easter.
The Collect.
LOrd, from whom all good things do come, grant us thy humble servants, that
by thy holy inspiration we may think those things that be good, and by thy
merciful guiding may perform the same, through our Lord Jesus Christ.

The Epistle.
SEe that ye be doers of the word, Iam. 1.22.
and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. For if any man hear the
word, and declares not the same by his works, he is like unto a man beholding
his bodily face in a glass: For as soon as he has looked on himself, he
goes his way, and forgets immediately what his fashion was. But whosoever
looks in the perfect law of liberty, and continues therein, if he be not a
forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, the same shall be happy in his
deed. If any man among you seem to be devout, and refraineth not his tongue,
but deceives his own heart, this man's devotion is in vain. Pure devotion,
and undefiled before God the father is this, to visit the fatherless and
widows in their adversity, and to keep himself unspotted of the world.

The Gospel.
VErily, John. 16.23.
verily I say unto you, whatseouer ye ask the Father in my name, he will give
if you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name. Ask, and ye shall receive,
that your joy may be full. These things have I spoken unto you by prouerves.
The time will come, when I shall no more speak unto you by prouerves, but I
shall show you plainly from my Father. At that day shall ye ask in my Name,
and I say not unto you, that I will speak unto my Father for you: for the
Father himself loves you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I
came out from God. I when out from the Father, and came into the world. Again,
I leave the world, and go to the Father. His disciples said unto him, Lo, now
thou talkest plainly, and speak no prouerve. Now are we sure that thou
know all things, and need not that any man should ask thee any
question, therefore believe we that thou came from God. Jesus answered them,
Now ye do believe: behold, the hour draws nigh, and is already come, that
ye shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: And yet
am I not alone, for the Father is with me. These words have I spoken unto you,
that in me ye might have peace, for in the world shall ye have tribulation:
But be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.

The Ascension day.
The Collect.
Grant we beseech thee Almighty God, that like as we do believe thy only
begotten Son our Lord to have ascended into the heavens: so we may also in
heart and mind thither ascend, and with him continually dwell.

The Epistle.
IN the former treatise, Acts. 1.1
dear Theophilus, we have spoken of all that Jesus began to do and teach,
until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the holy Ghost
had given commandments unto the Apostles, whom he had chosen, to whom also he
showed himself alive after his passion (and that by many tokens) appearing
unto them forty days, and speaking of the kingdom of God, and gathered them
together, and commanded them that they should not depart front Jerusalem, but
to wait for the promise of the Father, whereof (says he) ye have heard of me.
For John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the holy
Ghost after these few days. When they therefore were come together, they asked
of him, saying, Lord, will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to
Israel? And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the
seasons, which the Father has put in his own power. But ye shall receive
power after the holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me,
not only in Jerusalem, but also in all Jury, and in Samaria, and even unto
the worlds end. And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was
taken upon high, and a cloud recieued him up out of their sight, And while they
looked steadfastly up toward heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in
white apparel, which also said, Ye men of Galilee, Why stand ye gazing up
into heaven? This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so
come, even as ye have seen him go into heaven.

The Gospel.
Jesus appeared unto the eleven as they fate at meat, Mark. 16.14.
and cast in their teeth their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they
believed not them which had seen that he was risen again from the dead. And
he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to all
creatures: He that believes and is baptized, shall be saved: but he that
believes not, shall be damned. And these tokens shall follow them that believe:
In my name they shall cast out devils, they shall speak with new tongues, they
shall drive away serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not
hurt them: they shall lay their hands on the sick, and they shall recover. So
when the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received into heaven, and is on the
right hand of God. And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord
working with them, and confirming the word with miracles following.

Sunday after Ascension day.
The Collect.
O God, the King of glory, which have exalted thine only Son Jesus Christ
with great triumph unto thy kingdom in heaven: we beseech thee leave us not
^o^fortlesse, but send to us thine holy Ghost to comfort us, and exalt us unto
the same place whither our Savior Christ is gone before, who lives and
reigns, etc.

The Epistle.
THe end of al things is at hand. Be ye therefore sober, 1. Pet 47.
and watch unto prayer. But above all things have fervent love among your
selves: For love shall cover ye multitude of sins. Be ye barberous one to
another without grudging. As every man has received the gift, even so minister
the same one to another, as good ministers of the manifold graces of God. If
any man speak, let him talk as the words of God. If any man minister, let him
do it, as of the ability which God ministers to him, that God in all things
may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever
and ever. Amen.

The Gospel.
WHen the comforter is come, Ioh. 15.26.
whom I will send unto you from the Father (even the Spirit of truth, which
proceeds of the Father) he shall testify of me, and ye shall bear witness
also, because ye have These things have I said unto you, beacause ye should not
be offended. They shall excommunicate you, yea the time shall come, that
whosoever kills you, will think that he does God service. And such things
will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, neither yet
me. But these things have I told you, that when the time is come, ye may
remember then that I told you.

Whitsunday.
The Collect.
GOd which as upon this day have taught the hearts of thy faithful people, by
the sending to them the light of thy holy Spirit: Grant us by the same Spirit
to have a right judgment in all things, and evermore to rejoice in his holy
comfort, through the merits of Christ Jesus our Savior, who lives and reigns
with thee, in the unity of the same Spirit, one GOD, world without end. Amen.

The Epistle.
WHen the fifty days were come to an end, Acts 2.1.
they were al with one accord together in one place, and suddenly there came a
found from heaven, as it had been the coming of a mighty wind, and it filled
all the house where they sat. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues,
like as they had been of fire, and it sat upon each one of them, and they
were all filled with the holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues,
even as the same Spirit gave them utterance. Then were dwelling at Jerusalem,
Jews, devout men, out of every nation of them that are under heaven. When this
was noysed about, the multitude came together, and were astonished, because that
every man heard them speak with his own language. They wondered all, and
marueilled, saying among themselves, Behold, are not all these which speak,
of Galilee. And how hear we every man his own tongue wherein we were borne?
Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the inhabiters of Mesopotamia, and fo
Jury, and of Cappadocia, of Pontus and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, of Egypt,
and of the parts of Libya, which is beside Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,
Jews and Proselites, Creetes and Arabians, we have heard them speak in our
own tongues the great works of God.

The Gospel.
Jesus said unto his disciples, Ioh. 14.15
If ye love me, keep my commandments, and I will pray the father, and he
shall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even
the spirit of truth, whom the world can not receive, because the world sees
him not, neither knows him: But ye know him, for he dwells with you, and
shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless, but will come to you. Yet a
little while, and the world sees me no more, but ye see me: For I live, and ye
shall live. That day shall ye know, that I am in my father, and you in me, and
I in you. He that has my commandments, and keeps them, the same is he that
loves me. And he that loves me, shall be loved of my Father, and I will love
him, and will show mine own self unto him. Judas says unto him (not Judas
Iscariot) Lord, what is done that thou will show thy self unto us, and not
unto the world? Jesus answered, and said unto him, If a man love me, he will
keep my sayings, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and
dwell with him. He that loves me not, keeps not my sayings. And the word
which ye hear, is not mine, but the Fathers which sent me. These things have I
spoken unto you, being yet present with you: but the Comforter, which is the
holy Ghost, whom my Father will send in my Name, he shall teach you all things,
and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.
Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world gives, give
I unto you. Let not your hearts be grieved, neither fear. Ye have heard how I
said unto you, I go and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would
verily rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: For the Father is greater
then I. And now have I showed you before it come, that when it is come to
pass, ye might believe. Hereafter will I not talk many words unto you: for
the prince of this world comes, and has naught in me, but that the world may
know that I love the Father. And as the Father gave me Commandment, even so
do I.

The Epistle.
THen Peter opened his mouth, Act. 10.34
and said, Of a truth I perceive that there is no respect of persons with
God: but in all people, he that fears him, and works righteousness, is
accepted with him. Ye know the preaching that God sent unto the children of
Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, which is Lord over all things. Which
preaching was published thorowout all Jury, and began in Galilee, after the
Baptism which John preached, how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the holy
Ghost, and with power. Which Jesus went about doing good, and healing all that
were oppressed of the devil: for God was with him. And we are witnesses of all
things, which he did in the land of the Jews, and at Jerusalem: whom they
flew and hanged on a tree: him God raised up the third day, and showed him
openly, not to all the people, but unto us witnesses (chosen before of God for
the same intent) which did eat and drink with him after he arose from death.
And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify, that it is he
which was ordained of God to be the judge of quick and dead. To him give all
the Prophets witness, that through his Name whosoever believes in him, shall
receive remission of sins. While Peter yet spoke these words, the holy Ghost
fell on all them which heard the preaching. And they of the Circumcision, which
believed, were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the
Gentiles also was shed out the gift of the holy Ghost. For they heard them
speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, Can any man forbid
water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the holy Ghost
as well as we? And he commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord.
Then prayed they him to tarry a few days.

The Gospel.
SO God loved the world, John 3.16.
that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him, should
not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the
world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved. He
that believes on him, is not condemned. But he that believes not, is
condemned already, beacause he, has not believed in the Name of the only
begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the
world, and men loved darkness more then light, because there deeds were
evil. For every one that evil does, hates the light, neither comes to the
light, least his deeds should be reproved, But he that does the truth,
comes to the light, that his deeds may be known, how that they are wrought
in God.

The Epistle.
WHen the Apostles which were at Jerusalem, Acts. 8.14
heard say that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter
and John: which when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might
receive the holy Ghost. For as yet he was come on none of them, but they where
baptized only in the Name of Christ Jesus. Then laid they their hands on them,
and they received the holy Ghost.

The Gospel.
VErily, verily, John 10.1.
I say unto you, he that enters not in by the door into the sheepefold, but
climeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a murderer. But he that
enters in by the door, is the Shepherd of the sheep: To him the porter
opens, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by
name, and leads them out. And when he has sent forth his own sheep, he
goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. A
stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the
voice of strangers. This proverb spoke Jesus unto them, but they understood
not what things they there which he spoke unto them. Then said Jesus unto them
again, Verily, verily I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. All, even
as many as came before me, are thieves and murderers, but the sheep did not
hear them. I am the door, by me if any enter in, he shall be safe, and shall
go in and out, and find pasture. A thief comes not but for to steal, kill,
and destroy. I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it
more abundantly.

Trinity Sunday.
The Collect.
ALmighty and everlasting God, which half given unto us thy servants grace, by
the confession of a true faith to acknowledge the glory of the eternal
Trinity, and in the power of the divine Majesty to worship the Unity: We
beseech thee, that through the steadfastness of this faith we may evermore be
defended from all adversity, which live and reignest one God, world without
end. Amen.

The Epistle.
AFter this I looked, Apoc. 4.1.
and behold, a door was open in heaven, and the first voice which I heard, was
as it were of a trumpet, talking with me, which said, Come up higher, and I
will show thee things which must be fulfilled hereafter. And immediately I was
in the spirit, and beholbe, a seat was set in heaven, and one sat on the seat.
And he that sat, was to look upon, like unto a Jasper stone, and a Sardine
stone. And there was a rainebow about the seat, in fight like unto an Emerald.
And about the seat were four and twenty seats, and upon the seats four anb
twenty Elders sitting, clothed in white raiment, and had on their heads crowns
of gold. And out of the seat proceeded lightnings, and thunderings, and
voices. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the seat, which are
the seven Spirits of God. And before the seat there was a sea of glass like
unto Crystal, and in the mids of the seat, and round about the seat, were
four beasts full of eyes before anb behind. And the first beast was like a
Lion, anb the second beast like a Calfe, and the third beast had a face like a
man, and the fourth beast was like a flying Eagle. And the four beasts had
each of them fix wings about him, and they were full of eyes within. And they
did not rest day neither might, saying, Holy, Holy, holy Lord God Almighty,
which was, and is, and is to come. And when those beasts gave glory, and
honor, and thanks to him that sat on the seat (which lives for ever and
ever) the four and twenty Elders fell down before him that sat on the
Throne, and worshipped him that lives for ever, and cast their crowns before
the Throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord our God, to receive glory, and
honor, anb power, for thou have created all things, and for thy wills sake they
are, and were created.

The Gospel.
THere was a man of the Pharisees, John 3.1.
named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. The same came to Jesus by night, and
said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teatcher come from God, for no
man could do such miracles as thou do, except God were with him. Jesus
answered, and said unto him, Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be
borne from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus said unto him,
How can a man be borne when he is old? Can he enter into his mothers womb,
and be borne again? Jesus answered, Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a
man be borne of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God. That which is borne of the flesh, is flesh: and that which is borne of the
Spirit, is spirit, Marvel not thou that I said unto thee, Ye must be borne
from above. The wind blows where it lusts, and thou hear the sound
thereof, but thou can not tell whence it comes, nor whither it goes: So is
every one that is borne of the spirit. Nicodemus answered, and said unto him,
How can these things be? Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master in
Israel, and know not these things? Verily, verily I say unto thee, we speak
that we know, and testify that we have seen, and ye receive not our witness.
If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if
I tell you of heavenly things? And no man ascends up to heaven, but he that
came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. And as Moses
lift up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lift up,
that whosoever believes in him, perish not, but have everlasting life.

The first Sunday after Trinity.
The Collect.
GOd, the strength of al them that trust in thee, mercifully accept our
prayers: And because the weakness of our mortal nature can do no good thing
without thee, grant us the help of thy grace, that in keeping of thy
Commandments we may please thee both in will and deed, through Jesus Christ
our Lord.

The Epistle.
Dearly beloved, 1. John 4.7.
let us love one another, for love comes of God, and every one that loves,
is borne of God, and knows God. He that loves not, knows not God: For God
is love. In this appears the love of God to usward, because that God sent
his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his
Son to be the agreement for our sins. Dearly beloved, if God so loved us,
we ought also one to love another. No man has seen God at any time. If we
love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfect in us. Hereby
know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given us of his
Spirit. And we have seen, and do testify, that the Father sent the Son to
be the Savior of the world. Whosoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of
God, in him dwells God, and he in God. And we hane known and believed the
love that God has to us. God is love, and he that dwells in love, dwells
in God, and God in him. Herein is the love perfect in us, that we should trust
in the day of judgment: For as he is, even so are we in this world. There is
no fear in love, but perfect love casts ont fear: for fear has
painfulness. He that fears, is not perfect in love. We love him, for he
loved us first. If any man say, I love God, and yet hate his brother, he is a
liar. For how can he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, love God
whom he has not seen? And this commandment have we of him, that he which
loves God, sshould love his brother also.

The Gospel.
THere was a certain rich man, Luke 16.19.
which was clothed in purple and fine white, and fared deliciously every day.
And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which lay at his gate full of
sores, desiring to be refreshed with the crummes which fell from the rich man's
boorde, and no man gave unto him: The dogs came also and licked his sores. And
it fortuned that the beggar died, and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's
bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried. And being in hell in torments,
he lift up his eyes, and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom,
and he cried, and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus,
that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue, for I am
tormented in this flame. But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy
life time receiuedst thy plaesure, and contrariwise Lazarus received pain: but
now he is comforted, and thou art punished. Beyond all this, between us and
you there is a great space set, so that they which would go from hence to you,
cannot, neither may come from thence to us. Then he said, I pray thee therefore
father, send him to my fathers house, (for I have five brethren) for to warn
them, lest they come also into this place of torment. Abraham said unto him,
They have Moses and the Prophets, let them hear them. And he said, Nay father
Abraham, but if one come unto them from the dead, they will repent. He said
unto him, If they hear not Moses and the Prophets, neither will thy believe,
though one arise from death again.

The ij. Sunday after Trinity.
The Collect.
LOrd, make us to have a perpetual fear and love of thy holy name, for thou
never failest to help and govern them whom thou do bring up in thy
steadfast love. Grant this, etc.

The Epistle.
Marvel not my brethren, 1. John 3.13.
though the world hate you. We know that we are translated from death unto
life, because we love the brethren. He that loves not his brother, abides in
death. Whosoever hates his brother, is a manslayer. And ye know that no
manslayer has eternal life abiding in him. Hereby perceive we love, because
he gave his life for us, and we ought to give our lives for the brethren. But
who so has this worlds good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts vy
his compassion from his, how dwells the love of God in him? My babes, let us
not love in word, neither in tongue: but in deed and in verity. hereby we know
that we are of the verity, and can quiet our hearts before him. For if our
heart condemn us, God is greater then our heart, and knows all things.
Dearly beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we trust to Godward,
and whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his
commandments, and do those things which are pleasant in his sight. And this
is his commandment, that we believe on ye name of his Son Jesus Christ, and
love one another, as he gave commandment. And he that keeps his
commandments, dwells in him, and he in him: and hereby we know that he
abides in us, even by the spirit which he has given us.

The Gospel.
A Certain man ordained a great supper, Luke 14.16.
and bade many, and sent his servant at supper time, to say to them that were
bidden, Come, for all things are now ready. And they all at once began to make
excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a farm, and I must needs go
and see it, I pray thee have me excused. And another said, I have bought five
yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them, I pray thee have me excused. And another
said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. And the servant
returned, and brought his master word again thereof. Then was the good man of
the house displeased, and said to his servant, Go out quickly into the
streets and quarters of the City, and bring in hither the poor, and feeble,
and the halt, and blind. And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou have
commanded, and yet there is room. And the Lord said unto his servant, Go out
into the high ways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may
be filled. For I say unto you, that none of these men which were bidden, shall
taste of my supper.

The Epistle.
SVbmit your selves every man one to another, 1. Pet. 5.5.
knit your selves together in lowlines of mind: For God resists the proud,
and gives grace to the humble. Submit your selves therefore under the mighty
hand of God, that he may exalt you when the time is come. Cast all your care
upon him, for he cares for you. Be sober, and watch: for your adversary the
devil, as a roaring Lion walks about, seeking whom he may devour: whom
resist steadfast in ye faith, knowing that ye same afflictions are appointed
unto your brethren that are in the world. But the God of al grace, which has
called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, shall his own self (after
that ye have suffered a little affliction) make you perfect, settle, strength
an stablish you. To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

The Gospel.
THen resorted unto him all the Publicanes and sinners, Luke 15.1.
for to hear him. And the Pharisees and Scribes murmured, saying, He
receives sinners, and eats with the^. But he put forth this parable unto
them, saying, What man among you, having an hundredth sheep (if he lose one of
them) does not leave ninety and nine in the wilderness, and goes after that
which is lost, until he find it? And when he has found it, he lays it
on his shoulders with joy: and as soon as he comes home, he called together
his lovers and neighbors, saying unto them, Rejoice with me, for I have found
my sheep which was lost. I say unto you, that like wise joy shall be in
heaven over one sinner that repents, more then over ninety and nine just
persons, which need no repentance. Either what woman, having ten groats (if
she lose one) does not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek
diligently till she find it? and when she has found it, she calls her lovers
and her neighbors together, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the
groat which I lost. Likewise, I say unto you, shall there be joy in the
presence of the Angels of God, over one sinner that repents.

The iiij. Sunday after Trinity.
The Collect.
GOd the protector of all that trust in thee, without whom nothing is strong,
nothing is holy: increase and multiple upon us thy mercy, that thou being our
ruler and guide, we may so pass through things temporal, that we finally lose
not the things eternal: Grant this, heavenly Father, for Jesus Christ's sake
our Lord.

The Epistle.
I Suppose that the afflictions of this life are not worthy of the glory which
shall be showed upon us. For the fervent desire of the creatue abides, Romans 8.18
looking when the sons of God shall appear, because the creature is subdued
to vanity against the will thereof, but for his will which has subdued the
same in hope. For the same creature shall be delivered from the bondage of
corruption, into the glorious liberty of the sons of God. For we know that
every creature groneth with us also, and trauaileth in pain, even unto this
time: not only it, but we also which have the first fruits of the spirit,
mourn in our selves also, and wait for the adoption of the children of God,
even the deliverance of our bodies.

The Gospel.
BE ye merciful, Luke 6.36
as your Father also is merciful. Judge not, and ye shall not be judged.
Condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned. Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven.
Guie, and it shall be given unto you: good measure, and pressed down, and
shakentogether, andrunning over, shall men give into your bofomes. For with the
same measure that ye mete withal, shall other men mete to you again. And he
put forth a similitude unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? Do they not
both fall into the ditch? The disciple is not above his master. Every man
shall be perfect, even as his master is. Why see thou a mote in thy brothers
eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Either how can
thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine
eye, when thou see not the beam that is in thine own eye? First, thou
hypocrite, cast out the beam out of thine own eye, then shall thou see
perfectly to pull out the mote that is in thy brothers eye.

The fifth Sunday after Trinity.
The Collect.
Grant Lord, we beseeh thee, that the course of this world may be so peaceably
ordered by thy governance, that thy Congregation may joyfully serve thee in all
godly quietness, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
BE you all of one mind, 1. Pet. 3.8.
and of one heart, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous, (meek) not
rendering evil for evil, or rebuke for rebuke: but contrariwise bless,
knowing that ye are thereunto called, even that ye should be heirs of the
blessing. For he that does long after life, and loves to see good days, let
him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile. Let
him eschew evil and do good, let him seek peace and ensue it. For the eyes
of the Lord are over the righteous, and his cares are open unto their prayers.
Again, the face of the Lord is over them that do evil. Moreover, who is he
that will harm you, if ye follow that which is good? Yea, happy are ye if
any trouble happen unto you for righteousness sake. Be not ye afraid for any
terror of them, neither be ye troubled: but sanctify the Lord God in your
hearts.

The Gospel.
IT came to pass, Luke 5.1.
that when the people preassed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by
the lake of Genezareth, and saw two ships stand by the lakes side, but the
fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets. And he entered
into one of the ships (which pertained to Simon) and prayed him that he
would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the
people out of the ship. When he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch
out into the deep, and let slip your nets to make a draught. And Simon
answered, and said unto him, Master, we have labored all night, and have taken
nothing: Nevertheless, at thy commandment I will loose forth the net. And
when they had so done, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes. But their net
brake, and they beckened to their fellows which were in the other ship, that
they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both ships, that
they sunk again. When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at Jesus knees,
saying, Lord, go from me, for I am a sinful man. For he was a astonished, and all that there were with him, at the draught of fishes which they had taken: and so
was also James and John the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon.
And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not, from henceforth thou shall catch men. And
they brought the ships to land, and forsook all, and followed him.

The sixth sunday after trinity.
The Collect.
GOd which have prepared to them that love thee, such good things as pass man's
understanding: power into our hearts such love toward thee, that we loving
thee in all things, may obtain thy promises, which exceed all that the we can
desire, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
KNow ye not, Romans 6.3.
that al we which are baptized in Jesus Christ, are baptized to die with him?
We are buried then with him by baptism for to die, that likewise as Christ was
raised from death by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in
a new life. For if we be grafted in death like unto him, even so shall we be
partakers of the holy resurrection: knowing this, that our old man is crucified
with him also, that the body of sin might utterly be destroyed, that
henceforth we should not be servants unto sin. For he that is dead, is
justified from sin. Wherefore, if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we
shall also live with him: Knowing that Christ being raised from death, dies no
more, death has no more power over him. For as touching that he died, he died
concerning sin once: and as touching that he lives, he lives unto God.
Likewise consider ye also, that ye are dead as touching sin, but are alive
unto God, through Christ our Lord.

The Gospel.
IEesus said unto his Disciples, Mat. 5.20
Except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees,
ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. Ye have heard that it was said unto
them of old time, Thou shall not kill: whosoever kills, shall be in danger
of judgment. But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother
unadvisedly, shall be in danger of judgment. And whosoever says unto his
brother, Racha, shall be in danger of a Counsel. But whosoever says, Thou
fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. Therefore, if thou offerest thy gift at
the alter, and there remembrest that thy brother has ought against thee, leave
there thine offering before the alter, and go the way first, and be reconciled

quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him, least at any time the adversary
deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the minister, and then

thence, till thou have paid the uttermost farthing.

The Epistle.
I Speak grossly, Romans 6.19
because of the infirmity of your flesh. As ye have given your members
servants to uncleanness, and to iniquity (from one iniquity to another) even
so now give over your members servants unto righteousness, that ye may be
sanctified, For when ye were servants of sin, ye were void of righteousness.
What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? For the
end of those things is death. But now are ye delivered from sin, and made
the servants of God, and have your fruit to be sanctified, and the end
everlasting life. For the reward of sin is death, but eternal life is the
gift of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Gospel.
IN those days, Mar. 8.1.
when there was a very great company, and had nothing to eat, Jesus called
his disciples unto him, and said unto them, I have compassion on the people,
because they have been now with me three days, and have nothing to eat, and
if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they shall faint by the way:
for diverse of them came from far. And his disciples answered him, Where
should a man have bread here in the wilderness, to satisfy these? And he
asked them, How many loaves have ye? They said, Seven. And he commanded the
people to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and when he
had given thanks, he brake, and gave to his Disciples to set before them: and
they did set them before the people. And they had a few small fishes: and when
he had blessed, he commanded them also to be set before them. And they did eat
and were suffised. And they took vy of the broken meat that was left, seven
baskets full. And they that did eat, were about four thousand, And he sent
them away.

The Epistle.
BRethren, Romans 8.12
we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh: For if ye live
after the flesh, ye shall die. But if ye through the spirit, do mortify the
deeds of the body, ye shall live. For as many as are led by the spirit of
God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage
to fear any more: but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry
Abba, Father. The same spirit certifieth our spirit, that we are the sons of
God. If we be sons, then are we also heirs, the hetres (I mean) of God, and
heirs annexed with Christ, if so be that we suffer with him, that we may also
be glorified together with him.

The Gospel.
BEware of false prophets, Mat. 7.15.
which come to you in sheep clothing, but inwardly they are ravening Wolves:
ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns? Or figs
of thistles? Even so, every good tree brings forth good fruits: but a
corrupt tree brings forth evil fruits. A good tree cannot bring forth bad
fruits, neither can a bad tree bring forth good fruits. Every tree that
brings not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
Wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that faieth unto
me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that does the
will of my father which is in heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of
heaven.

BRethren, 1. Cor. 10.1.
I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that our fathers were all under
the cloud, and al passed through the sea, and were all baptized under Moses in
the cloud, and in the Sea, and did all eat of one spiritual meat, and did all
drink of one spiritual drink: and they drank of the spiritual rock that
followed them, which rock was Christ. But in many of them had God no delight:
for they were overthrown in the wilderness. These are ensamples to us, that we
should not lust after evil things, as they lusted: and that ye should not be
worshippers of images, as were some of them, according as it is written: The
people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. Neither let us be
defiled with fornication, as some of them were defiled with fornication, and
fell in one day three and twenty thousand. Neither let us tempt Christ, as
some of them tempted, and were destroyed of servents. Neither murmr ye, as
some of them murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer. All these things
happened unto them for ensamples: but are written to put us in remembrance,
whom the ends of the world are come upon. Wherefore let him that thinks he
stands, take heed lest he fall. There has none other tentation taken you,
but such as follows the nature of man. But God is faithful, which shall not
suffer you to be tempted above your strength, but shall in the midst of
temptation make a way, that ye may be able to bear it.

The Gospel.
Jesus said unto his disciples, Luke 16.1.
There was a certain rich man which had a steward, and the same was accused
unto him that he had wasted his goods. And he called him, and said unto him,
How is it that I hear this of thee? Give accounts of thy steward ship, for
thou may be no longer Steward. The Steward said within himself, What shall
I do? For my master takes away from me the Stewardship. I cannot dig, and to
beg I am ashamed. I wot what to do, that when I am put out of the
stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. So when he had called all
his masters debtors together, he said unto the first, How much owe thou unto
my master? And he said, An hundred tons of oil. And he said unto him, Take
thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. Then said he to another,
How much owe thou? And he said, An hundred quarters of wheat. He said unto
him, Take thy bill, and write four score. And the Lord commended the unjust
Steward, because he had done wisely. For the children of this world are in
their nation wiser then the children of light. And I say unto you, make you
friends of the unrighteous Mammon, that when ye shall have need, they may
receive you into everlasting habitations.

The Epistle.
COncerning spiritual things, 1. Cor. 12.1.
brethren, I would not have you ignorant. Ye know that ye were Gentiles, and
went your ways unto dumb images, even as ye were led. Wherefore I declare
unto you, that no man speaking by the spirit of God, defieth Jesus. Also no
man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghost. There are
diversities of gifts, yet but one spirit. And three are differences of
administrations, and yet but one Lord. And there are differences of
administrations, and yet but one Lord. And there are diverse manners of
operations, and yet but one God, which works all in all. The gift of the
spirit is given to every man to edify withal. For to one is given, through
the spirit, the utterance of wisdom, to another is given the utterance of
knowledge by the same spirit, to another is given faith by the same spirit,
to another the gift of healing by the same spirit, to another power to do
miracles, to another to prophecy, to another judgment to discern spirits, to
another diverse tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues: And these all
works the self same spirit, dividing to every man a several gift, even as
he will.

The Gospel.
AND when he was come near to Jerusalem, Luke 19.41.
he beheld the city, and wept on it, saying, If thou had known those
things which belong unto thy peace, even in this thy day, thou would take
heed: but now are they hid from thine eyes. For the days shall come unto thee,
that thine enemies shall cast a bank about thee, and compass thee round, and
keep thee in on every side, and make thee even with the ground, and thy
children which are in thee: And they shall not leave in thee one stone upon
another, because thou know not the time of thy visitation. And he went into
the Temple, and began to cast them out that sold therein, and them that bought,
saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer, but ye have
made it a den of thieves. And he taught daily in the Temple.

BRethern, 1. Cor. 15.1.
as pertaining to the Gospel which I preached unto you, which ye have also
accepted, and in the which ye continue, by the which ye are also saved: I do
you to wit after what manner I preached unto you, if ye keep it, except ye
have believed in baine: For first of all I delivered unto you that which I
received, how that Christ died for our sins, agreeing to the Scriptures, and
that he was buried and that he arose again the third day according to the
Scriptures, and that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: after that,
he was seen of more then five hundredth brethren at once, of which many remain
unto this day, and niany are fallen a sleep. After that appeared he to James
then to all ye Apostles, and last of all he was seen of me, as of one that was
borne out of due time: For I am the least of the Apostles, which am not worthy
to be called an Apostle, because I have persecuted the Congregation of God. But
by the grace of God I am that I am: and his grace which is in me, was not in
vain. But I labored more abundantly then they all: yet not I, but ye grace of
God which is with me. Therefore, whether it were I, or they, so we preached,
and so ye have believed.

The Gospel.
CHrist told this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they
were perfect, Luke. 18.9.
and despised other. Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a
Pharisee, and the other a Publicane. The Pharisee, stood and prayed thus with
himself: GOD I thank thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners,
unjust adulterers, or as this Publicane. I fast twice in the week, I give
tithe of all that I possess. And the Publicane standing afar off, would not
lift up his eyes to heaven, but smote his breast, saying, God be merciful to
me a sinner. I tell you, this man departed home to his house justified more
then the other. For every man that exalts himself, shall be brought low:
and he that humbles himself, shall be exalted.

The Epistle.
SVch trust have we through Christ to Godward, 2. Cor. 3.4.
not that we are sufficient of our selves to think any thing as of our selves:
but if we be able unto any thing, the same comes of God, which has made us
able to minister the new Testament, not of the letter, but of the spirit: For
the letter kills, but the spirit gives life. If the ministration of death,
through the letters figured in stones, was glorious, so that the children of
Israel could not behold the face of Moses for the glory of his con^tenance
(which glory is done a way:) why shall not the ministration of the spirit be
much more glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be glorious, much
more does the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.

The Gospel.
Jesus departed from the coasts of Tire and Sidon, Mar. 7.31.
and came unto the Sea of Galilee, through the mids of the coasts of the ten
cities. And they brought unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in
his speech: and they prayed him to put his hand upon him. And when he had
taken him aside from the people, he put his fingers into his ears, and did
spit, and touched his tongue, and looked up to heaven, and sighed, and said
unto him, Ephata, that is to say, Be opened. And straightway his ears were
opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plain. And he
commanded them that they should tell no man. But the more he forbade them, so
much the more a great deal they published, saying, He has done all things
well, he has made both the dease to hear, and the dumb to speak.

ALmighty and merciful God, of whose only gift it comes that thy faithful
people do unto thee true and laudable service: Grant we beseech thee, that we
may so run to thy heavenly promises, that we fail not finally to attain
the same, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
TO Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He faith not, Gal. 3.16.
In his seeds, as many: but in thy seed, as of one, which is Christ. This I
say, that the law which began afterward beyond four hundred and thirty years,
does not disanull the Testament that was confirmed before of God unto
Christward, to make the promise of none effect. For if the inheritance come of
the law, it comes not now of promise: But God gave it to Abraham by promise.
Wherefore then serves the law? The law was added because of transgression
(till the seed came to whom the promise was made) and it was ordained by Angels
in ye hand of a Mediator. A mediator is not a mediator of one: but God is
one. Is the Law then against the promise of God? God forbid. For if there had
been a Law given which could have given life, then no doubt righteousness should
have come by the law. But the Scripture concludes all things under sin, that
the promise by the faith of Jesus Christ should be given to them that believe.

The Gospel.
Happy are the eyes which see the things that ye see. For I tell you that
many Prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which ye see, Luke
10.23.
and have not seen them, and to hear those things which ye hear, and have
not heard them. And behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him,
saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? He said unto him,
What is written in the law? How read thou? And he answered, and said, Love
the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thy self. And he said
unto him, Thou have answered right: this do, and thou shall live. But he
willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor? Jesus
answered and said, A certain man descended from Jerusalem to Jericho, and
fell among thieves, which robbed him of his raiment, and wounded him, and
departed; leaving him half dead. And it chanced that there came down a
certain Priest that same way, and when he saw him, he passed by. And likewise
a Leuite (when he went nigh to the place) came and looked on him, and passed
by. But a certain Samaritane, as he iourneyed, came unto him, and when he saw
him, he had compassion on him, and went to him, and bound up his wounds, and
powered in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to a
common Inn, and made provision for him. And on the morrow when he departed,
he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take
cure of him, and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will
recompense thee. Which now of these three, think thou, was neighbor unto
him that fell among the thieves? And he said unto him, He that showed mercy on
him. Then said Jesus to him, Go, and do thou likewise.

The Epistle.
I Say, Gal. 5.16.
walk in the spirit, and fulfill not the lust of the flesh. For the flesh
lusts contrary to the spirit, and the spirit contrary to the flesh. These
are contrary one to the other, so that ye cannot do whatsoever ye would. But
and if ye be led of the spirit, then are ye not under the law. The deeds of
the flesh are manifest, which are these: Adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
wantonness, worshipping of images, witchcraft, hatred, variance, zeal, wrath,
strife, seditions, sects, envying, murder, drunkenness, gluttony and such
like, of the which I tell you before, as I have told you in times past, that
they which commit such things, shall not be inheritors of the kingdom of God.
Contrarily, the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering,
gentleness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, temperance: against such
there is no law. They truly that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh, with
the affections and lusts.

The Gospel.
ANd it chanced as Jesus went to Jerusalem, Luke 17.11.
that he passed through Samaria, and Galilee. And as he entered into a certain
town, there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar off, and put
forth their voices, and said, Jesus master, have mercy on us. When he saw
them, he said unto them, Go, show your selves unto the Priests. And it came
to pass, that as they went, they were cleansed. And one of them, when he saw
that he was cleansed, turned back again, and with a loud voice praised God,
and fell down on his face at his feet, and gave him thanks. And the same was
a Samaritane. And Jesus answered and said, Are there not ten cleansed? but where
are those nine? There not found that returned again to give God praise, save
only this stranger. And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way, thy faith has
made thee whole.

YEsee how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand. As many
as desire with outward appearance to please carnally, Gal. 6.11.
the same constrain you to be circumcised, only lest they should suffer
persecution for the cross of Christ, for they themselves which are
circumcised, keep not the law, but desire to have you circucised, that they
might rejoice in your flesh. God forbid that I should rejoice, but in the
cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, whereby the world is crucified unto me, and I
unto the world. For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision avails any thing at
all, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. And as many as walk according
unto this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon Israel, that pertains
to God. From henceforch let no man put me to business: for I bear in my body
the marks of the Lord Jesus. Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be

The Gospel.
NO man can serve two masters: For either he shall hate the one and love the

or else lean to the one and despise the other. Ye can not serve God and
Mammon. Therefore I say unto you, Be not careful for your life, what ye shall
eat or drink, nor yet for your body, what raiment ye shall put on. Is not the
life more worth then meate^ and the body more of value then raiment? Behold
the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor carry into
the barnes, and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are ye not much better the^
they? Which of you by taking careful thought can add one cubite unto his
stature? And why care ye for raiment? Consider the Lilies of the field how they
grow, they labor not, neither do they spinne: and yet I say unto you, that
even Solomon in all his royalty was not clothed like one of these. Wherefore if
God so clothe the grass of the field, which though it stand to day, is to
morrow cast into the furnace, shall he not much more do the same for you, O
ye of little faith? Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat, or
what shall we drink, or wherewith shall we be clothed? After all these
things do the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that ye have
need of all these things. But rather seek ye first the kingdom of God, and
the righteousness thereof, and all these things shall be ministered unto you.
Care not then for the morrow, for to morrow day shall care for it self.
Sufficient unto the day is the travail thereof.

unto the Lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath
day? And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him
go, and answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an Ass, or an Ox fallen
into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the Sabbath day? And they
could not answer him again to these things. He put forth also a similitude to
the ghests, when he marked how they preased to be in the highest rooms, and
said unto them, When thou art bidden to a wedding of any man, sit not down
in the highest room, least a more honorable man then thou be bidden of him,
and he that bade him and thee, come and say to thee, Give this man room: and
thou begin with shame to take the lowest room. But rather when thou art
bidden, go and fit in the lowest room, that when he that bad thee, comes,
he may say unto thee, Friend, sit up higher: then shall thou have worship in
the presence of them that sit at meat with thee. For whosoener exalts
himself, shall be brought low, and he that humbles himself, shall be exalted.

WHen the Pharisees had heard that Jesus had put the Sadduces to silence, Matthew

they came together, and one of them, which was a Doctor of the Law, asked him
question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the greatest commandment
in the Law? Jesus said unto him, Thou, shall love the Lord thy GOD with all
thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first
and greatest commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shall thou thy
neighbor as thy self. In these two commandments hang all the Law and the
Prophets. While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, saying,
What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They said unto him, The son of
David. He said unto them, How then does David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine
enemies thy footestoole; If David then call him Lord, how is he the^ his son?
And no man was able to answer him any thing, neither durst any man from that
day forfh ask him any mo questions.

understanding, being far from a godly life, by the means of the ignorance that
is in them, and because of the blindness ot their hearts: which being past
repentance, have given themselves over unto wantonness, to work all manner of
uncleanness, even with greediness. But ye have not so learned Christ: If so
be that ye have heard him, and have been taught in him, as the truth is in
Jesus (as concerning the conversation in times past) to lay from you the old
man, which is corrupt, according to the deceivable lusts: to be renewed also
in the spirit of your mind, and to put on that new man, which after God is
shapen in righteousness and true holiness. Wherefore put away lying, and
speak every man truth unto his neighbor, forasmuch as we are members one of
another. Be angry, and sin not. Let not the sun go down upon your wrath,
neither give place to the backbiter. Let him that stole, steal no more, but
let him rather labor with his hands the thing which is good, that he may gine
unto him that needs. Let no filthy communication proceed out of your mouth,
but that which is good to edify withal, as often as need is, that it may
minister grace unto the hearers. And grieve not the holy spirit of God, by whom
ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, and fiercenes,

be forgiven thee. And behold, certain of the Scribes said within themselves,
This man blasphemeth. And when Jesus saw their thoughts, he said, wherefore
think ye evil in your hearts? Whether is it easier to say, Thy sins be
forgiven thee: or to say, Arise, and walk? But that ye may know that the son
of man has power to forgive sins in earth: Then says he to the sick of the
palsy, Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thy house. And he arose, and
departed to his house. But the people that saw it, marueiled, and glorfied God,

bidden to the wedding: and the would not come. Again he sent forth other
servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have premine dinner,
mine oxen and my fatlings are killed, and al things are ready: come unto the
marriage. But they mabe light of it, anb went their ways, one to his farm
place, another to his merchandife, and the remnant took his servants, and
intereated them shamefully, and slew them. But when the King heard thereof, he
was wroth, and sent forth his men of ware, and destroyed those murderers, and
burnt up their City. Then said he unto his servants, The marriage indeed is
prepared, but they which were bidden, were not worthy. Go ye therefore out
into the high ways, and as many as ye find, bid them to the marriage. And the
servants went forth into the high ways, and gathered together all, as many as
they could find, both good and bad: and the wedding was furnished with
ghestes. Then the king came in to see the ghestes, and when he spied there a
man which had not on a wedding garment, he said unto him Friend, how came
thou in higher, not having a wedding garment? And he was even speechless. Then
said the King to the ministers, Take and bind him hand and foot, and cast him
into vttet darkness, there shall be weeping and weeping and gnashing of
teeth. For many be called, but few are chosen.

The Epistle.
MY brethren, Ephesians.6.10.
be strong through the Lord, and through the power of his might. Put on all the
armor of God, that ye may stand against all the assaults of the devil. For
we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against rule, against power,
against worldly rulers, even gouernounrs of the darkness of this world,
against spiritual craftines in heavenly things. Wherefore take unto you the
whole whole armor of God, that ye may be able to resist in the evil day, and
stand perfect in all things. Stand therefore, and your loins girde with the
truth, having on the brestplate of righteousness, and having shoes on your
feet, that ye may be prepared for the Gospel of peace. Above all, take to you
the shield of faith, wherewhih ye may quench all the fiery darts of the
wicked, and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is
the word of God. And pray always with all manner prayer and supplication in the
spirit, and watch thereunto with all instance and supplication, for all Saints,
and for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth
freely, to utter the secrets of the Gospel (whereof I am a messenger in bonds)
that therein I may speak freely, as I ought to speak.

THere was a certain ruler, Ioh. 4.46.
whose sanne was sick at Capetnaum. As Soon as the same heard that Jesus was
come out of Jury into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he
would come down and heal his son: for he was even at the point of death.
Then siad Jesus unto him, except ye see fignes and wonders, ye will not
believe. The ruler said unto him, Sir, come down or ever that my son die.
Jesus faith unto him, Go thy way, thy son lives. The man believed the word
that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. And as he was going down,
the servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son lives. Then enquired he
of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him. Yesterday at
the seventh hour the sever left him. So the father knew that it was the same
hour in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son lives. And he believed, and
all his household. This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he
was come out of Jury into Galilee.

I Thank my God with all remembrance of you always in all my prayers for you,
Phil. 1.3.
and pray with gladness, because ye are come into the fellowship of the
Gospel, from the first day until now: and am surely certified of this, that
he which has begun a good work in you, shall perform it, until the day of

PEter said unto Jesus, Matthew. 18.21.
Lord, how often shall I forgive my brother, if he sin against me? till seven
times: Jesus says unto him, I say not unto thee, until seven times: but,
seventy times seven times. Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a
certain man that was a King, which would take accomptes of this servants. And
when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which ought him ten
thousand talents: but forasmuch as he was not able to pay, his Lord commanded
him to be sold, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and payment to
be made. The servants fell down, and besought him, saying, Sir, have patience
with me, and I will pay thee all. Then had the Lord pity on that servant, and
loosed him, and forgave him the debt. So the same servant went out, found one
of his fellows which ought him an hundred pence; and he laid hands on him, and
took him by the throat, saying, Pay that thou owe. And his fellow fell
down, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee
all. And he would not, but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay
the debt. So when his fellows saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came
and told unto their Lord all that had happened. Then his Lord called him, and
said unto him, O thou ungracious servant, I forgave thee all that debt when
thou desiredst me: should not thou also have had compasston on thy frllow,
even as I had pity on thee? And his Lord was worth, and delivered him to the
Iaylers, till he should pay all that was due unto him. So like wise shall my
heavenly father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one
his brother their trespasses.

BRethren, Phil. 3.17.
be folowers together of me, and look on them which walk, even so as ye have
us for an ensample. For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now
tell you weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end
is damnation, whose belly is their God, and glory to their shame, which are
worldly minded. But our conversation is in heaven, from whence we look for the

is able also to subdue all things unto himself.

truly, neither carest thou for any man, for thou regardest not the outwaqrd
appearance of men. Tell us therefore, how think thou? Is it lawful that
tribute be given unto Caesar, or not? But Jesus perceiving their wilkednesse,
said, whiy tempt ye me ye hypocrites? Show me the tribute money. And they took
him a penie. And he said unto them, whose is this image and superscription?
They said unto him, Cesars. Then said he unto them, Give therefore unto Caesar

WHile Jesus spoke unto the people, Mat. 9.18.
behoid, there came a certain ruler and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is
even now deceassed, but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she live. And
Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples. And behold, awomau
which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him and
touched the hemme of his vesture. For she said within herself, If I may touch
but even his vesture only, I shall be safe. But Jesus turned him about, and when
he saw her, Daughter, be of good comfort, thy faith has made thee safe. And
the woman was made whole even the same time. And when Jesus came into the
rulers house, and said the ministrels and people making and a noise, he said
unto them, Get you hence, for the maid is not dead, but sleeps. And they
laughed him to scorn. But when the people were put forth, he went in, and
took her by the hand, and said, Damosel, arise. And the Damosel arose. And
this noise was abroad in all that land.

be saved, and Israel shall dwell without fear. And this is the name that they
shall call him, Even the Lord our righteousness. And therefore behold, the
time comes, faith the Lord, that it shall be no more said, The Lord lives,
which brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt: but, The Lord
lives, which brought forth and led the seed of the house of Israel out of
the North land, and from all counthreys wherwe I have seattered them, and they

The Gospel.
WHen Jesus lift up his eyes, John 6.5.
and saw a great company come unto him, he faith unto Philip, Wheme shall we
buy bread that these may eat? This he said to prove him, for he himself
knew what he would doc. Philip answered him, Two hundredth penyworth of bread
are not suffcient for them, that every man may take a little. One of his
Disciples (Andrew Simon Peter's brother) said unto him, There is a lad here,
which has filue barley loaves, and two fishes, but what are they among so many?
And Jesus said, Make the people sit down. There was much grass in the place.
So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. And Jesus took the
bread, and when he had given thanks, he gave to his disciples, and the
disciples to them that were set down, and like wise of the fishes as much as
they would. When they had eaten enough, he faith unto his disciples, Gather up
the broken meat which remains, that nothing be lost. And they gathered it
together, ly fi^led, twelve basketswith the broken meat of the five bariy
loanes, which broken meat remained unto them that had eaten. Then those men
(when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did) said, This is of a truth the
same Prophet that sthould come into the world.

S. Andrews day.
The Collect.
ALmighte God, which did give such grace unto thy hily Apostle Saint Andrew,
that he readily obeyed the calling of thy Son Jesus Christ, and followed him
without delay: grant unto us all, that we, being called up thy holy word, may
forth with give over our selves obediently to follow thy holy commandments,
through the same Jesus Christ out Lord.

The Epistle.
IF thou acknowledge with thy mouth that Jesus is the Lord, Romans 10.9
and believe in thy heart that God raised him up from death, thou shall be
safe. For to believe with the heart, iustfieth, and to knowledge with the
mouth, makes a man safe. For the Scripture faith, whosoever believes on him.
shall not be confounded. There is no difference between the Jew and the
Gentile: For one is Lord of al, which is rich unto all that call upon him. For
whosoever does call on the Name of the Lord, shall be safe. How then shall they
call on him, on whom they have not believed? How shall they believe on him, of
whom they have not heard? How shall they hear without a preacher? And how
shall they preach without they be sent? As it is written, How beautiful are
the seete of them which bring tidings of peace, and bring tidings of good
things? But they have not allobeyed to the Gospel. For Esai faith, Lord, who
has believed our sayings? So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing
comes by the word of God. But I ask, Have they not herard? No doubt their
sound went out into all lands, and their words into the ends of the world. But
I demand whether Israel did know or no: First Moses faith, I will provoke you
to envy by them that are no people by a foolish nation I will anger you. Esai
after that is bold, and says, I am found of them that sought me not, I am
manifest unto them that asked not after me. But against Israel he says, All
day long have I stretched forth my hands unto a people that believes not, but
speaks against me.

The Gospel.
AS Jesus walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethren, Mat. 4.18.
Simon, which was called Perer, and Andrew his brother, castinga net into the
sea (for they were fishers) and he said unto them, Follow me, and I will make
you to become fishers of men. And they straightway left their nets, and
followed him. And when he was gone forth from thence, he saw other two
brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the ship with
Zebedee their father, mending their nets: and he called them. And they
immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.

S. Thomas the Apostle.
The Collect.
Almighty and euerlining God, which for the more confirmation of the faith,

Son Jesus Christ, that our faith in thy sight never be reproved. Hear us,
O Lord, througe the same Jesus Christ, to whom with thee and the holy Ghost, be

together, it grows unto an holy Temple of the Lord, in whom ye also are built
together, to be an habitation of God through the holy Ghost.

The Gospel.
THomas one of the twelve, John 20. 24
which is called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. The other
disciples therefore said unto him, we have seen the Lord. But he said unto
them, Except I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger
into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not
believe. And after eight days, again his disciples were within, and Thomas
with them. Then came Jesus, when the doors were shut, and stood in the midst,
and said, Peace be unto you. And after that, he said to Thomas, Bring thy
finger hither, and see my hands, and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into
my side, and be not faithless, but believing. Thomas answered, and said unto
him, My Lord, and my God. Jesus said unto him, Thomas, because thou have seen
me, thou have believed. Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have
believed. And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his
disciples, which are not written in this book. These are written, that ye
might belecue, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that (in believing)
ye might have life through his Name.

The Conversion of S. Paul.
The Collect.
GOD which have taught all the world, through the preaching of thy blessed
Apostle Saint Paul, grant we beseech thee, that we which have his wonderful
conversion in remembrence, may follow and fuifill thy holy doctrine that he
taught, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
ANd Saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the Disciples of
the Lord, went unto the hie Priest, Acts. 9.1.
and desired of him letters to carry to Damasco, to the synagogues, that if he
found any of this way (were they men or women) he might bring them bound to
Jerusalem. And when he iourneyed, it fortuned that as he was come nigh to
Damasco, suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven, and he fell
to the curth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
me? And he said, what art thou Lord? And the Lord said, I am Icsus whom thou
persecutest. It is hard for thee to kick against the prick. And he both
trembling and astonished said, Lord, what will thou have me to do? And the Lord
said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what
thou must do. The men which tourneyed with him, stood amazed, hearing a voice,
but seeing no man. And Saul arose from the earth, and when he opened his eyes,
he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damasco. And
he was three days without sight, and did neither eat nor drink. And there
was a certain disciple at Damasco, named Ananias: and to him said the Lord in
a vision, Anamas, And he said, Behold, I am here Lord. And the Lord said unto
him, Arise, and go into the strcete which is called Straight, and seek in the
house of Judas, after one called Saul of Thursus. For behold, he prays, and
has seen in a vision a man named Ananias, coming in unto him, and putting
his hands on him, that he might receive his sight. Then Ananias answered, Lord,
I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he has done to the Saints at
Jerusalem. And here he has authority of the hie Priests, to bind all yt call
on thy Name, The Lord said unto him, Go thy way, for he is a chose vessel unto
me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the children of
Israel. For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my Names sake,
And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house, and put this hands on him,
and said, Brother Saul, the Lord that appeared unto thee in the way as thou
came, has sent me, that thou might receive thy sight, and be filled with
the holy Ghost. And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales,
and he received sight, and arose, and was baptized, and received meat, and was
comforted. Then was Saul a certain days with the discriples which were at
Damasco. And straight way be preached Christ in the Synagogues, how that he
was the Son of God. But all that heard him, were amazed, and said, Is not
this he that spoiled them, which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came
hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the hie Priests:
But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt
at Damasco, affirming that this was very Christ.

The Gospel.
PEter answered and said unto Jesus, Matthew. 19.27.
Behold, we have for saken all and followed thee, what shall we have therefore;
Jesus said unto them, verily I say unto you, that when the Son of man shall
sit in the seat of his majesty, ye that have followed me in the regeneration,
shall sit also upon twelve seats, and judge the twelve tribes of Israel. And
every one that forsakes house, or brethen, or sisters, or father, or mother,
or wife, or children, orlands, for my names sake, shall receive an hundred
fold, and shall inherit everlasting life. But many that are first, shall be
last, and the last shall be first.

The purification of Saint Marie the Virgin.
The Collect.
ALmighty and everlasting God, we humbly beseech thy Majesty, that as thy
only begotten Son was this day presented in the Temple in substance of our
fiesh: so grant that we may be Presented unto thee with pure and clear
mmdes, by Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
The same that is appointed for the Sunday. The Gospel.

The Gospel.
WHen the time of their purification (after ye law of Moses) was come, they
brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the
Law of the Lord: Every man child that first opens the matrix, Luke 2.22.
shall be called holy to the Lord) and to offer (as it is said in the Law of
the Lord) a pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons. And behold, there was a
man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and the same man was just and godly,
and looked for the cpnsolation of Israel, and the holy Ghost was in him. And an
answer had he received of the holy Ghost, that he should not see death, except
he first saw the Lord Christ. And he came by inspiration into the Temple.

S. Matthias day.
The Collect.
ALmighty God, which in the place of the traitor Judas did choose thy
faithful servant Mathias to be of the number of thy twelve Apostles: Grant
that thy Church, being always preserved from false Apostles, may be ordered and
guided by faithful and true pastors, though Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
IN those days Peter stood up in the mids of the disciples, Acts 1.15
and said, (The number of names that were together, were about an hundred and
twenty) ye men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled,
which the holy Ghost, through the mouth of David, spoke before of Judas, which
was guide to themt that took Jesus. For he was numbered with us, and had
obtained fello wship in this ministration. And the same has now possessed a
platte of ground with the reward of iniquity, and when he was hanged, hurst
asu^der in the mids, and all his bowels gushed out. And it was known unto
all the inhabiters of Jerusalem, insomuch that the same field is called in
their mother tongue, Acheldama, that is to say, the bloody field. For it is
written in the book of Psalms, His habitation be void, and no man be
dwelling therein, and his bishopric let another take. Wherefore, of these men
which have companied with us (all the time that the Lord Jesus had all his
Conversation among us, beginning at the baptism of John, unto that same day
that he was taken up from us) must one be ordained to be a witness with us of
his resurrcction. And they appointed two: Joseph, which is called Barsabas
(whose surname was Iustus) and Matthias. And when they prayed, they said, Thou
Lord which know the hearts of all men, show whether of these two thou have
chosen, that he may take the room of this ministration and Apostleship, from
which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go into his own place, And
they gave forth their lots, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was counted
with the eleven Apostles.

The Gospel.
IN that time Jesus answered, Matt. 1.25.
and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou
have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have showed them unto
babes: Verily Father, even so was it thy good pleasure. All things are given
unto me of my Father: and no man knows the Son, but the father, neither
knows any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son
will open him. Come unto me, all ye that labor, and are laden, and I will
ease you. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in
heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls: for my yoke is easy, and my
burden is light.

Annunciation of the Virgin Mary.
The Collect.
WE beseech thee, Lord, power thy grace into our hearts, that as we have
known Chrst thy sons incarnation by the message of an Angel: so by his
cross and passion we may be brought unto the glory of his resurrection,
through the same Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
GOd spoke once again to Ahaz, saying, Esai. 7.10.
Require a token of the Lord thy God, whether it be toward the depth beneath,
or toward the height above. Then said Ahaz, I will require none, neither will
I tempt the Lord. And he said, Hearken to, ye of the house of David: Is it not
enough for you that ye be grievous unto men, but ye must grieve my God also;
And therefore the Lord shall give you a token: Behold, a virgin shall conceive,
and bear a son, and thou his mother shall call his name Emmanuel. Butter and
houie shall he eat, that he may know to resuse the evil, and choose the good.

The Gospel.
ANd in the sixth month, Luke 1.26.
the Angel Gabriel was sent from God, unto a City of Galilee named Nazareth,
to a virgin spoused to a man, whose name was Joseph, of the house of David, and
the virgins went in unto her, and said, Hail full of grace, the Lord is with
thee, blessed art thou among women. When she saw him, she was abashed at his
saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation that should be. And the
Angel said unto her, Fear not Marie, for thou have found grace with God:
Behold, thou shall conceive in thy womb, and bear a son, and shall call his
name Jesus. he shall be great, and shall be called the son of the Highest. And
the Lord God shall give unto him the seat of his father David, and he shall
reign over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be none
end. Then said Mary to the Angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man:
And the Angel answered, and said unto her, The holy Ghost shall come upon thee,
and the power of the highest shall over shadow thee. Therefore also that holy
thing which shall be borne, shall be called the son of God. And behold, thy
cousin Elizabeth, she has also conceived a son in her age, and this is the
sixth month, which was called barren: for with God nothing shall be impossible.
And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy
word. And the Angel departed from her.

Saint Marks day.
The Collect.
Almighty God, which have instructed thy holy Church with the heavenly
doctrine of thy Evangelist Saint Mark, give us grace that we be not like
children, carried away with every blast of vain doctrine: but firmly to be
established in the truth of thy holy Gospel, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
Unto every one of us is given grace, Ephe. 4.7
according to the measure of the gift of Christ. wherefore he says, when he
went up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. That
he ascended, what means it, but that he also descended first into the lower
parts of the earth: He that descended, is even the same also that ascended up
above all heavens, to fulfill all things. And the very same made some Apostles,
some Prophets, some Evangelists, some shepherds, and teachers, to the
edisying of the saints, to the work and administration, even to the edisying
of the body of Christ, till we all come to the unity of the faith, and
knowledge of the son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the full
perfect age of Christ: That we henceforth should be no more children, wavering
and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the wiliness of men, through
craftiness, whereby they say awaite for us to decieue us. But let us follow
the truth in love, and in all things grow in him which is the head, even
Christ: in whom if all the body be coupled and knit together throughout every
joint, wherewith one ministers to another (according to the operation, as
every part has his measure) he encreseth the body, unto the edisying of it
self through love.

The Gospel.
I Am the true Vine, Ioh. 15.1
and my father there is an hysbandman. Every branche that breareth not fruit in
me, he will take away: and every branche that bears fruit, will he purge,
that it may bring forth more fruit. Now are ye clean through the words
which I have spoken unto you. Bide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot
bear fruit of it self, except it bide in the Vine: no more can ye, except ye
abide in me. I am the Vine, ye are the branches. He that abides in me, and
Iin him, the same brings forth much fruit. For without me can ye do
nothing. If a man bide not in me, he is rast forth as a branche, and is
withered, and men gather them, and cast them into the fix, and they burn. If
ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask what ye will, and it shall
be done for you. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, and
become my Disciples. As the Father has loved me, even so also have I loved
you: Continue you in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in
my love, even as I have kept my fathers commandments, and abide in his love.
These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that
your joy might be full

S. Philip and James day.

know thy Son Jesus Christ to be the way, the Truth, and the Life, as thou
have thught S.Philip, and other the Apostles, throught Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
James the servant of God, Iam. 1.1
and of the Lord Jesus Christ, sends greeting to the twelve Tribes which are
scattered abroad. My brethren, count it for an exceeding joy, When ye fall
into diverse temptations: Knowing this, that the trying of your faith gendreth
patience, and let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect
and sound, lacking nothing. If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of him
that gives it, even God, which gives to all men indifferently, and casts no
man in the teeth, and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, and
waver not. for he that doubts, is like a wave of the Sea, which is tossed of
the winds, and carried with violence: neither let that man think, that he
shall receive any thing of the Lord. A wavering minded man is unstable in all
his ways. Let the brother which is of low degree, rejoice when he is
exalted. Again, let him that is rich, rejoice when he is made low: For even
as the flower of the grass shall he pass away. For as the Sun reseth with
heat, and the grass withers, and his flower falls away, and the beauty of
the fashion of it perishes: even to shall the rich man perish in his ways.
Happy is the man that endures temtation: for when he is tried, he shall
receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.

The Gospel.
ANd Jesus said unto his Disciples, Ioh. 14.1.
Let not your hearts be troubled. ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my
Fathers house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I
go to prepare a place for you: And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will
come again, and receive you, even unto my self, that where I am, there may ye
be also. And whither I go, ye know, and the way ye know. Thomas says unto
him, Lord, we know not whither thou go, and how is it possible for us to
know the way: Jesus faith unto him, I am the way, and the Truth, and the Life,
No man comes to the father but by me. If ye had known me, ye had known my
father also: And now ye know him, and have seen him, Philip since unto him,
Lord, show us the Father, and it susficeth us. Jesus says unto him, Have I
been so long time with you, and yet have thou not known me: Philip, he that
has seen me, has seen my Father: and how say thou then, Show us the
Father: Beleeuest not thou, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: The
words that I speak unto you, I speak not of my self: but the Father that
dwells in me, is he that does the works. Believe me that I am in the Father,
and the Father in me: or else believe me for the works sake. Verily, verily I
say unto you, He that believes on me, the works that I do, the same shall he
do also: and greater works then these shall he do, because I got unto my
Father. And whatsoever ye ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father
may be glorified by the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my Name, I will
do it.

S.Barnabe Apostle.
The Collect.
Lord almighty, which have endued thy holy Apostle Barnabas with singular
gistes of the holy Ghost: let us not be destitute of thy manifold gifts, nor
yet of grace, to use them always to thy honor and glory, through Jesus Christ
our Lord.

The Epistle.
TIdings of these things came unto the ears of the congregation which was in
Hirusalem. And they sent forth Barnabas, Act. 11.22
that he should go unto Antioch. Which when he came, and had seen the grace
of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would
contiunally cleave unto the Lord. For he was a good man, and full of the holy
Ghost, and of faith, and much people was added unto the Lord. Then departed
Barnabas to seek Saul: and when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch.
And it chanced, that a whole year they had their conversation with the
congregation there, and they taught much people, insomuch that the disciples of
Antioch, were the first that were called Christen. In those days came.
Prophets from the cities of Hierusalcm unto Antioch. And there stood up one of
them, named Agabus, and signified by the spirit, that three should be great
dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the Emperor Claudius
days. Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, purposed to send
succor unto the brethren which dwelt in Jury: which thing they also did, and
sent it to the Elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.

The Gospel.
THis is my commandment, Ioh. 15.12.
that ye love together as I have loucd you. Greater love has no man then this,
that a man bestow his life for his friends. Ye are my friends, if ye do
whatsoever I command you. Henceforth call I not you servants: for the servant
knows not what his lord does: but you have I called friends, for all things
that I have heard of my Father, I have opened unto you. ye have not chosen me,
But I have chosen you, and ordained you to go and bring forth fruit, and that
your fruit should remain, that whatsoever ye ask of the father in my Name,
he may give it you.

Saint John Baptist.
The Collect.
Almighty God, by whose prouidenee thy servant John Baptist was wonderfully
borne, and sent to prepare the way of thy son our Savior by Preaching of
penance: make us so to follow his doctrine and holy life, that we may truly
repent, according to his preaching, and after his example constantly speak the
truth, boldly rebuke vice, and pattently suffer for the trueths sake, through
Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
BE of good cheer, Esai. 40.1.
my people. Dye prophets, comfort my people, faith your God, comfort Jerusalem
at the heart, and tell her that her travail is at an end, that her offense is
pardoned, that she has received of the Lords hand sufficient corxectrion for
all her sins. A voice cried in ye wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord in the
wilderness, make straight the path for our God in the desext. Let all valleys be
exalted, and every mountain and hill be laid low. What so is crooked, let it
be made straight, and let the rough be made plain fields. For the glory of
the Lord shall appear, and all flesh shall at once see it. For why: the mouth
of the Lord has spoken it. The same voice spoke, Now cry. And the Prophet
answered, what shall I cry: That all flesh is grass, and that all the
goodlines thereof is as the flower of the field. The grass is withered, t^
flower falls away. Even so is the people as grass, when the breath of ye
Lord blows upon them. Nevertheless, whether the gtrasse wither, or that the
flower fade away, yet the word of our God endures for ever. Go up unto the
hie hill (O Sion) thou that bring good tidings, lift up thy voice with power,
O thou preacher Jerusalem, lift it up without fear, and say unto the cities
of Judah. Behold your God, behold, the Lord God shall come with power, and
bear rule with his arm. Behold, he brings his treasure with him, and his
works go before him. He shall feed his flock like an heardman: he shall
gather the Lambs together with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and
shall kindly entreat those that bear young.

The Gospel.
Elizabeth's time came yt she should be delivered, Luke 1.57
and she brought forth a son. And her neighbors and her cousins heard say
how the Lord had showed great mercy upon her, and rejoiced with her. And it
fortuned, that in the eight day they came to circumcise the child, and called
his name Zachary, after the name of his father. And his mother answered and
said. Not to, but his name shall be called John. And they said unto her, There
is none of thy kindred that is named with this name. And they made signs to his
father, how he would have him called. And he asked for writing tables, and
wrote, fying, His name is John. And they marueiled all. And his mouth was
opened immediately and his tongue also, and he spoke and praised God. And fear
came on all them that dwelt nigh unto him. And all these sayings were noysed
abroad throughout all the hie country of Jury, and they that heard them,
laid them up in their hearts, saying, what manner of child shall this be: And
the hand of the Lord was with him. And his father Zacharias was filled with the
holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying, Praised be the Lord God of Israel, for he
has visited and redeemed his people, and has raised up a horn of salvation
unto us, in the house of his servant David, even as he promised by the mouth of
his holy Prophets, which were since the world began. That weshould be saved
from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us. That he would deal
mercifully with our fathers, and remember his holy Covenant: that he would
perform the oath which he swear to our father Abraham, for to give us. That
we, being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might serve him without
freare all the days of our life, in such holiness and righteousness, as are
acceptable for him. And thou child shall be called the Prophet of the
highest: for thou shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways.
To give knowledge of salvation unto his people, for the remission of sins,
through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the day spring from an high has
visited us. To give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of
death, and to guide our feet into the way of peace. And the child grew, and
waxed strong in spirit, and was in wilderness, till the day came when he
should show himself unto the Israelites.

Saint Peter's day.
The Collect.
Almighty God, which by thy son Jesus Christ, have given to thy Apostle
S.Peter many excellent gifts, and comandedst him earnestly to feed thy flock:
make we beseech thee all Bishops and Pastors diligently to preach thy holy
word, and the people obediently to follow the same, that they may receive the
crown of everlasting glory, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
AT the same time, Acts 12.1
Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the congregation,
and he killed James the brother of John with the sword. And because he saw it
pleased the Jews, he proceeded further, and took Peter also. Then were the
days of sweet bread. And when he had caught him, he put him in prison also,
and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to be kept, intending
after Easter to bring him forth to the people. And Peter was kept in prison,
but prayer was made without ceasing of the congregation unto God for him. And
when Herod would have brought him out unto the people, the same night slept
Peter tweene two soldiers, bound with two chains, and the keepers before the
door kept the prison. And behold, the Angel of the Lord was there present, and
a light shined in the habitation, and he smote Peter on the side, and stirred
him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell from his hands. And the
Angle said unto him, Gird thy self, and bind on thy sandales. And so he did.
And he faith unto him, East thy garment about thee, and follow me. And he
came out, and followed him, and wist not that it was truth which was done by
the Angel, but though thee had seen a vision. When they were past the first
and secoud watch, they came unto the iron gate that leads unto the city,
which opened to them by the own accord: and they went out, and passed through
one street, and forthwith the Angle departed from him. And when Peter was
come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety that the Lord has sent his
Angel, and has delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the waiting
of the people of the Jews.

The Gospel.
WHen Jesus came into the coasts of the City, Mat. 16.13
which is called Cesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, whom do men
say that I the son of man am: They said, Some say that thou art John
Baptist, some Elias, some Ieremias, or one of the Prophets. He says unto
them, But whom say ye that I am: Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art
Christ the son of the living God. And Jesus answered, and said unto him,
Happy art thou Simon the son of Iohas: for flesh and blood has not opened
that unto thee, but my father which is in heaven. And I say unto thee, that
thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my congregation, and the gates
of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of
the kingdom of heanen: And whatsoever thou bindest in earth, shall be bound in
heaven: and whatsoever thou loosest in earth, shall be loosed in heaven.

S. James the Apostle.
The Collect.
GRant, O merciful God, that as thine holy Apostle James, leaving his father
and all that he had, without delay was obedient unto the calling of thy Son
Jesus Christ, and followed him: So we, forsking all wordly and carnal
affections, may be evermore ready to follow thy commandments, through Jesus
Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
IN those days came Prophets from the City of Jerusalem, Acts. 11.27
unto Antioch. And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by
the Spirit, that there should be great dearth throughout all the world, which
came to pass in the Emperor Claudius days. Then the disciples, every man
according to his ability, purposed to send succor unto the brethren which
dwelt in Iewrie: which thing they also did, and sent it to the elders, by the
hands of Barnabas and Saul. At the same time Herod the king stretched forth his
hands to vex certain of the congregation. And he killed James the brother of
John with the sword: and because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded
further, and took Peter also.

The Gospel.
THen came to him the mother of Zebedees children, Mat. 20.20
with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him. And
he said unto her, what will thou: She said unto him, Grant that these my two
sons may sit, the one on the right hand, and the other on the lest, in they
kingdom. But Jesus answered and said, ye wot not what ye ask. Are ye able
to drink of the cup that I shall drink of: and to be baptized with the
baptism that I am baptized with: They said unto him, we are. He said unto
them. ye shall drink in deed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism
that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand and on my left, is not
mine to give, but it shall chance unto them that it is prepared for of my
father. And when the ten heard this, they disdained at the two brethren. But
Jesus called them unto him, and said, ye know that the princes of the
nations have dominion over them, and they that are great men, exercise
authority upon them. It shall not be so among you. But whosoever will be
great among you, let him be your minister, and whosoever will be chief among
you, let him be your servant: Even as the son of man came not to be
ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a redemption for many.

S.Bartholomew Apostle.
The Collect.
O Almighty and everlasting God, which have given grace to thine Apostle
Bartholomewe, truly to believe and to preach the word: grant, we beseech
thee, unto thy Church, both to love that he believed, and to preach that he
taught, through Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
BY the hands of the Apostles were many signs and wonders showed among the
people: and they were all together with one accord in Salomons porche. And of
other durst no man join himself to them: nevertheless the people magnified
them. The number of them that believed in the Lord, Act. 5.12
both of men and women, grew more and more, in so much that they brought the
sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the
least way the shadow of Peter when he came by, might shadow some of them. There
came also a multitude out of the cities round about, unto Jerusalem, bringing
sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits, and they were
healed every one.

The Gospel.
AND there was a strife among them, Luke 22.24
which of them should seem to be the greatest. And he said unto them, The
kings of nations reign over them, and they that have authority upon them, are
called gracious Lords: but ye shall not so be. But he that is greatest among
you, shall be as the younger, and he that is chief, shall be as he that does
minister. For whether is greater, he that sits at meat, or he that
serves: Is not he that sits at meat: But I am among you as one that
ministers. Ye are they which have bidden with me in my temptations. And I
appoint unto you a kingdom, as my father has appointed unto me, that ye may
eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on seats judging the twelve
tribes of Israel.

Saint Matthew Apostle.
The Collect.
Almighty God, which by thy blessed son did call Matthew from the receite
of custom, to be an Apostle and Evangelist: Grant us grace to forsake all
covetous desires and inordinate love of riches, and to follow thy said son
Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns, etc.

The Epistle.
SEeing that we have such an office, 2. Cor. 4.1
even as God has had mercy on us, we go not out of kind, but have cast from
us the clokes of unhonesty, and walk not in craftiness, neither handle we
the word of God deceitfully, but open the truth, and report our selves to
every man's conscience in the sight of God. If our Gospel be yet hid, it is hid
among them that are lost, in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds
of them which believe not, lest the light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ
(which is ye image of God) should shine unto them, For we preach not our
selves, but Christ Jesus to be the Lord, and our selves your servants for
Jesus sake. For it is God that commands the light to shine out of darkness,
which has shined in our hearts, for to give the light of the knowledge of the
glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ.

The Gospel.

ANd as Jesus passed forth from thence, Ma^^. 9
he saw a man (named Matthew) sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said
unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him. And it came to pass, as
Jesus sat at meat in his house, behold, many Publicanes also and sinners
that came, sat down with Jesus and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw
it, they said unto his disciples, why eats your master with Publicaues and
sinners: But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be strong,
need not the Physicion, but they that are sick. Go ye rather and learn
what that means: I will have mercy, and not sacrifice. For I am not come to
call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

Saint Michael and all Angels.
The Collect.
EVerlasting God, which have ordained and constituted the feruices of all
Angels, and men in a wonderful order: Mercifully grant that they which always
do thee secuice in heaven, may by thy appointment succor and defend us in
earth, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Epistle.
THere was a great battle in heaven: Michael and his Angels fought with the
Dragon, Apo. 12.7
and the Dragon fought with his Angels, and prevailed not, neither was theri
place found any more in heaven. And the great Dragon, that old Serpent, called
the devil and Satanas, was cast out, which deeciueth all the world. And he was
cast into the earth, and his angels were cast out alst with him. And I heard a
loud voice, saying, In heaven is now made s;aluation, and strength, and the
kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ. For the accuser of our
brethren is cast down, which accused them before God day and night. And they
overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony,
and they loved not their lives unto the death. Therefore rejoice ye heavens,
and ye that dwell in them. Woe unto the inhabiters of the earth, and of the
sea, for the devil is come down unto you, which has great wrath, because he
knows that he has but a short time.

The Gospel.
AT the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, Mat. 18.1
saying, who is the greatest in the kindome of heaven: Jesus called a child
unto him, and set him in the midst of them, and said, Verily I say unto you,
except ye turn and become as children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom
of heaven. Whoseuer this child, that same is the greatest in the kingdom of
heaven. And whoseuer receives such a child in my name, receives me. But who
so does offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better
for him that amilstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned
in the depth of the sea. Woe unto the World because of offenses. Necessary it
is that offenses come: but woe unto the man by whom the offense comes.
Wherefore, if thy hand or thy foot hinder thee, cut thm off, and cast them
from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halte or maimed, rather
then thou should (having two hands, or two feet) be cast into everlasting
fire. And if thing eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: It is
better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather then (Having two eyes)
to be cast into hell fire. Take heed that ye despise not one of these little
ones: For I say unto you, that in heaven their Angels do always behold the
face of my Father, which is in heaven.

Saint Luke the Evangelist.
The Collect.
AL mighty God, which calledst Luke the Physitton, whose praise is in the
Gospel, to be a Physician of the soul: it may plese thee by the wholesome
medicines of his doctrine, to heal all the diseases of our souls, through thy
son Jesus Christ Lord.

The Epistle.
WAtch thou in all things, 2. Tim. 4.5
suffer afflictions, do the work thoroughly of an Evangelist, fulfill thine
office unto to the uttermost. Besober. For I am now ready to be offered, and the
time of my departing is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have fulfilled
my couse, I have kept the faith. From henceforth there is laid up for me a
crown of rightousnesse, which the Lord that is a righteous Judge shall give me
at that day, not to me only, but to all them that love his coming. Do thy
diligence that thou may come shortly unto me. For Demas has forsaken me,
and loves this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica. Crescens is
gone to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia, only Lucas is with me. Take Mark, and
bring him with thee, for he is profitable unto me for the ministration. And
Tychicus have I sent unto Ephesus. The cloak that I left at Troada with Carpus,
when thou come bring with thee, and the books, but spectally the parchment.
Alexander the Coppersmith did me much evil, the Lord reward him according to
his vee ves: of whom be thou ware also, for the has greatly with s^ood our
words.

The Gospel.
THe Lord appointed other seventy (and two) also, Luck. 10.1.
and sent them two and two before him into every city and place, whither he
himself would come. Therefore he said unto them, The haruenst is great, but
the laborers are few. Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, to send
forth laborers into his harusest. Go your ways, behold, I send you forth as
lambs among woulues. Bear no Wallet, neighter scrip, nor shoes, and salute
noman by the way. Into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, no man be to this
house. And if the son of peace be three, your peace shall rest upon him, if
not, if shall return to you again. And in the same house tarry still, eating
and drinking such as they give: For the labourer is worthy of his reward.

Simon and Jude Apostles.
The Collect.
Almighty God, which have builded thy congregation upon the foundation of the
Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the head corner stone:
Grant us so to be joined together in unity of spirit by their doctrine, that
we may be made an holy temple acceptable to thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Episile.
IVdas the servant of Jesus Christ, Inde 1.
the brother of James, to them which are called and sanctified in GOD the
Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ: mercy unto you, and peace, and love be
multiplied. Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common
salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, to exhort you that ye
should continually labor in the faith, which was once given unto the Saints.
For there are certain ungodly men, craftily crept in, of which it was written
aforetime unto such iuvgement; They turn the grace of our God into
wantonness, and deny God (which is the only Lord) and our Lord Jesus Christ.
My mind is therefore to put you in remembrance, forasmuch as ye once know
this, how that the Lord (after that he had delivered the people out of Egypt)
destroyed them which after believed not. The angels also which kept not their
first state, but left their own habitation, he has reserved in everlasting
chains under darkness, unto the indgement of the great day. Even as Sodom and
Gomorrhe, and the cities about them, which is like manner defiled themselves
with fornication, and followed strange slesh, are set forth for an example, and
suffer the pain of eternal fire. Like wife these being deceived by dreams,
defile the flesh, despise rulers, and speak evil of them that are in
authority.

The Gospel.
THis command I you, Ioh. 15.17
that ye love together. If the world hate you, ye know it hated me before it
hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: howbeit,
because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world,
therefore the world heateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The
servant is not greater then the Lord. If they have persecuted me, they will
also persecute you. If they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.
But all these things will they do unto you for my Names sake, because they
have not known him that sent me. It I had not come and spken unto them, they
should have had no sin: but now have they nothing to cloak their sin
withal. He that hates me, hates my Father also. If I had not done among
them the works which none other man did, they should have had no sin: but
now have they both seen and hated, not only me, but also my father. But this
happens, that the saying might be fulfilled that is written in the^e law,
They hated me without a cause. But when the comforter is come, whom I will send
you from the Father, even the spirit of truth (which proceeds of the Father)
he shall testify of me. And ye shall bear witness also, because ye have been
with me from the beginning.

All Saints.
The Collect.
ALmighty God, which have knit together thy elect in one Communion and
fellowship, in the mystical body of thy son Christ our Lord: grant us grace
so to follow thy holy Saints in all virtuous and godly living, that we may come
to those unspeakable joys, which thou have prepared for them that unfeignedly
love thee, through Jesus Christ Lord. Amen.

The Epistle.
BEhol, Apoc. 7.2
I John saw another Angel ascend from the rising of the sun, which had the
seal of the living God, and he cried with a loud voice to the four Angels
(to whom power was given to hurt the earth, and the sea) saying, Hurt not the
earth, neigher the sea, neither the trees, till we have sealed the servants of
our God in their foreheads. And I heard the number of them which were sealed,
and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the
tribes of the children of Israel.

Of the tribe of Judah, were sealed xii. M.

Of the tribe of Ruben, were sealed xii.M.

Of the tribe of Gad, were sealed xii.M.

Of the tribe of Aster, were saled xii.M.

Of the tribe of Nephthalim, were sealed xii.M.

Of the tribe of Manasses, were sealed xii.M.

Of the tribe of Simeon, were sealed xii.M.

Of the tribe of Leui, were sealed xii.M.

Of the tribe of Isachar, were sealed xii.M.

Of the tribe of Zabulon, were sealed xii.M.

Of the tribe of Ieseph, were sealed xii.M.

Of the tribe of Benjamin, were sealed xii.M.

After this I beheld, and lo, a great multitude (which no man can number) of
all nations, and people, and tongues, stood before the seat, and before the
Lamb, clothed with long white garments, and Palms in their hands, and cried
with a loud voice, saying, Salvation be ascribed to him that sits upon the
seat of our God, and unto the Lamb. And all the Angels stood in the compass
of the seat, and of the Elders, and the four beasts, and fell before the
seat on their faces, and worshipped God, saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory,
and wisdom, and thanks, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God
for evermore. Amen.

The Gospel.
Jesus seeing the people, Man. 5.1
went up into a mountain, and when he was set, his Disciples came to him. And
after that he had opned his mouth, he taught them, saying, Blessed are the
poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that
mourn, for they shall receive comfort. Blessed are the meek, for they shall
receive the inheritance of the earth. Blessed are they which hunger and thirst
after righeousnesse, for they shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful,
for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see
God. Blessed are the peace makers, for they shall be called the children of God.
Blessed are they which suffer persection for righteousness sake, for theirs is
the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye when men reusle you, and persecute you,
and shall falsely say all manner of evil sayings against you for my sake,
rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For so persecuted
they the Prophets which were before you

The order for the administration of the Lords Supper, or holy Communion.
SO many as intend to be partakers of the holy Communion, shall signify their
names to the Curate over night, or else in the morning before the beginning of
Morning prayer, or immediately after.

And if any of those be an open and notorious evil liver, so that the
Congregation by him is offended, or have done any wrong to his neighbors, by
word or deed: the Cu. rate having knowledge thereof shall call him, and
advertise him in any wise not to presume to the Lords Table, until he have
openly de clared him self to have truly repented and amended his former
naughty life, that the Congregation may thereby be satisfied, which before
were offended, and that he have recompensed the parties whom he has done
wrong unto, or at the least, declare himself to be in full purpose so to do,
as soon as he conue niently may.

The same order shall the Curate use with those betwixt whom he perceives
malice and hatred to reign, not suffering them to be partakers of the Lords
Table, until he know them to be reconciled. And if one of the parties so at
variance, be content to forgive from the bottom of his heart, all that the
other has trespassed against him, and to make amends for that he himself has
offended, and the other party will not be persuaded to a godly unity, but
remain still in his frowardness and malice: the Minister in that case ought
to admit the penitent person to the holy Communion, and not him that is
obstinate.

The Table having at the Communion time a fair white linen cloth upon it,
shall stand in the body of the Church, or in the Chauncel, where Morning prayer
and Evening prayer be appointed to be said, And the Priest standing at the
North side of the Table, shall say the Lords prayer with this Collect following.

The Communion.
Almighty God, unto whom all hearts be open, all desires known, and from
whom no secrets are hid: cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration
of thy holy spirity, that we may perfectly love thee, and worthsly magnify
thy holy name, throught christ our Lord. Amen.

Then shall the Priest rehearse distinctly all the ten Commandments: and the
people kneeling, shall after every Commandment, ask God mercy for their
trasgression of the same, after this sort.

The Minister. God spoke these words and said, I am the Lord they God: Thou
shall have none other gods but me.

People. Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this Law.

Minister. Thou shall not make to thy self any graven image, nor the likeness
of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth be^tath or in the water
under the earth. Thou shall not how down to them, nor worship them: For I the
Lord thy God am a ielous God, and visit the sin of the fathers upon the
children, vuto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and show
mercy unto thosands in them that love me, and keep my commandments.

People. Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this Law.

Minister. Thou shall not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the
Lord will not hold him guiltless that takes his Name in vain.

People. Lord have mercy vspon us, and entline our hearts, etc.

Minister. Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day. Sire days shall thou
labor, and do all that thou have to do, but the seventh day is the Sabbath
of the Lord thy God. In it thou shall do no manner of work, thou and thy
son, and thy daughter, thy man servant, and thy maid servant, thy ^attell,
and the stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made
heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day:
wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it.

People. Lord have mercy upon us, and encliue our hearts to keep this law.

Minister. Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the
land, which the Lord thy God gives thee.

Minister. Thou shall not count thy neighbors house, thou shall not covet thy
neighbors wife, nor his servant, nor his maid, nor his ^xe, nor his Ass, nor
any thing that is his.

People. Lord have mercy upon us, and write all these thy Laws in our hearts,
we beseech thee.

Then shall follow the Collect of the day, with one of these two Collects
following for the King, the Priest standing up, and saying.

Let us pray. Almighty God, whose kingdom is everlasting, and power infinite,
have mercy upon the whole congregation, and to rule the heart of thy chosen
servant James, our King and givernour, that he (knowing whose minister he is)
may about al things seek thy honor and glory, and that we subjects (duly
confidering whole authority he has) may faithfully serve, honor, and humbly
obey him, in thee, and for thee, according to thy blessed word and ordinance,
through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with thee and the holy Ghost lives and
reigns ever one God, world without end. Amen

Almighty and everlasting God, we be taught by thy holy word, that the hearts
of kings are in thy rule and governance, and that thou do dispose and tnrne
them as it seems best to thy godly wisdom: we humbly beseech thee so to
dispose and govern the heart of James thy servant, our King and governor,
that in all his thoughts, words, and works he may ever seek thy honor and
glory, and study to preserve thy people committed to his charge, in wealth,
peace, and godliness: Grant this, O merciful Father, for thy dear sons
sake Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Immediately after the Collects, the Priest shall read the Epistle, beginning
thus.

And the Epistle ended, he shall say the Gospel, beginning thus.

And the Epistle and Gospel being ended, shall be said the Creed.

I Believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of
al things visible and invisible: and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only
begotten son of God, begotten of his Father before al worlds, God of God,
light of light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one
substance with the father, by whom al things were made: who for us men, and for
our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the holy Ghost of
the virgin Marie, and was made man, and was crucified also for us under Pontius
Pilate. He suffered, and was buried, and the third day he rose again
according to the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven, and sits on the right
hand of the Father. And he shall come again with glory to judge both the
quick and the dead: Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the
holy Ghost, the Lord and giver of life, who proceeds from the father and the
soon, who with the father and the soon together is worshipped and glorified,
who spoke by the Prophets. And I believe one Catholic and Apostolic Church.
I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins. And I look for the
refurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

After the Creed, if there be no Sermon, shall follow one of the Homilies
already set forth, or hereafter to be set forth by common authority.

After such Sermon, Homily, or exhortation, the Curate shall declare unto the
people, whether there be any holy days, or fasting days the week following,
and earnestly exhort them to remember the poor, saying one or more of these
sentences following, as he thinks most convenient by his discretion.

Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and
glorify your Father which is in heaven. Matthew. 5.


Lay not up for your selves treasure upon the earth, where the rust and moth
does corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for your
selves treasures in heaven, where neither rust nor moth does corrupt, and
where thieves do not break through and steal. Matthew. 6.


Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do unto them, for
this is the Law and the Prophets. Matthew. 7.

reap your worldly things: 1. Cor 9.

so has the Lord als ordained, that they which preach the Gospel, should live
of the Gospel. 1. Cor 9.

Let him that is taught in the word, minister unto him that teaches, in all
good things. Be not deceived, God is not mocked: For whatsoever a man sows,

While we have time, let us do good unto all men, and specially unto them
which are of the household of faith. Gal. 6.

the time to come, that they may attain eternal life. 1. Tim. 6.

the face of the Lord shall not be turned away from thee. Tob. 4.

lays out, it shall paid him again. Prou. 19.


Blessed be the man that provides for the sick and needy: the lord shall

Then shall the Churchwardens, or some other by them appointed, gather the
devotion of the people, and put the same into the poor man's box, and upon the
offering days appointed, every man and woman shall pay to the Curate the due
and accustomed offerings. After which done, the Priest shall say.

Almighty and everliving God, Isthere be no Alms given unto the poor, then
shall the words (of accepting our Alms) be left out unsaid. which by the holy
Apostle have taught us to make prayers and supplications, and to give thanks
for all men: we humbly beseech thee, mostmercifully (to accept our Alms, and)
to receive these our prayers, which we offer unto thy divine maiestle,
beseeching thee to inspire continually the universal Church with the spirit of
truth, vnitic, and concord: and grant that al they that do confess thy holy
name, may agree in the truth of thy holy word, and live in unity and godly
love. We beseech thee also to save and defend all Christian kings, princes, and
governors, and spccially thy servant James our king, that under him we may be
godly and quietly governed: and grant unto his whole counsel, and to all
that be put in authority under him, that they may truly and indifferently
minister justice, to the punishment of wickedness and vice, and to the
maintenance of Gods true religion and virtue. Give grace (O heavenly Father) to
all Bishops, Pastors, and Curates, that they may both by their life and
doctrine set forth thy true and lively word, and rightly and duly administer
thy holy Sacraments: and to all thy people give heavenly grace, and specially
to this Congregation here present, that with meek heart and due reverence,
they may hear and receive thy holy word, truly serving thee in holiness and
righteousness all the days of their life. And we most humbly beseech thee of
thy goodness, O Lord, to comfort and succor all them which in this
transitory life be in trouble, sorrow, need, sickness, or any other
adversity: Grant this, O Father, for Jesus Christ's sake our only mediator
and advocate. Amen.

Then shall follow this exhortation at certain times, when the Curate shall
see the people negligent to come to the holy Communion.

WE be come together at this time (dearly beloved brethren) to feed at the
Lords Supper, unto the which in Gods behalf I bid you all that be here
present, and beseech you for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, that ye will not
refuse to come thereto, being so lovingly called and biden of God himself. Ye
know how grievous and unkind a thing it is, when a man has prepared a rich
feast, decked his table with all kind of provision, so that there lacks
nothing but the ghests to sit down, and yet they which be called (without any
cause) most unthankfully refuse to come. Which of you in such a case would not
be moved: who would not think a great injury and wrong done unto him:
wherefore most dearly beloved in Christ, take ye good heed, lest ye,
withdrawing your selves from this holy Supper, provoke Gods indignation against
you. It is an easy matter for a man to say, I will not communicate, because I
am otherwise let with worldly business. But such excuses be not so easily
accepted and allowed before God. If any man say, I am a grievous sinner, and
therefore am afraid to come: wherefore then do you not repent and ame^nd:
when God calls you, be not you ashamed to say you will not come: when you
should return to God, will you excuse your self, and say that you be not
ready: Consider earnestly with your selves, how little such fained excuses
shall avail before GOD. They that refused the feast in the Gospel, because
they had bought a Farm, or would try their yokes of Oxen, or because they
were married, were not so excused, but counted unworthy of the heavenly feast.
I for my part am here present, and according to mine office, I bid you in the
name of God, I call you in Christ's behalf, I exhort you, as you love your own
salvation, that ye will be partakers of this holy Communion. And as the son
of God did vouchsafe to yield up his soul by death upon the cross for your
health: Even so it is your d^etie to receive the Communion together in the
remembrance of his death, as he himself communded. Now, if you will in no
wise thus do, consider with your selves how great injury you do unto God,
and how sore punishment hangs over your heads for the same. And where as you
offend God so sore in refusing this holy banquet, I admonish, exhort, and
beseech you, that unto this unkindness ye will not add any more: which thing
ye shall do, if ye stand by as gazers and lookers on them that do
communicate, and be not partakers of the same your selves. For what thing can
this be accounted else, then a further contempt and unkindness unto God:
Truly, it is a great unthankfulness to say nay, when ye be called: but the
fault is much greater when men stand by, and yet will neither eat nor drink
this holy Communion with other. I pray you what can this be else, but even to
have the mysteries of Christ in derision: It is said unto all, Take ye, and
eat, Take and drink ye all of this, Do this in remembrance, of me. With
what face then or with what countenance, shall ye hear these words: what will
this be else, but a neglecting, a despising and mocking of the Testament of
Christ: wherefore rather then ye should so do, depart you hence, and give
place to them that be godly disposed. But when you depart. I beseech youn
ponder with your selves, from whom ye depart, ye depart from the Lords table,
ye depart from your brethren, and from the banquet of most heavenly food.
These things if ye earnestly consider, ye shall by Gods grace return to a
better mind, for the obteining whereof, we shall make our humble petitions,
while we shall receive the holy Communion.

And sometime shall be said this also, at the discretion of the Curate.

DEarly beloved, for as much as our duty is to render to Almighty God our
heavenly Father most hearty thanks, for that he has given his Son our
Saniour Jesus Christ, not only to dye for us, but alsd to be our spiritual
food and sustenance, as it is declared unto us, as well by Gods word, as by
the holy Sacraments of his blessed body^and and blood, the which being so
comfortable a thing to them which receive it worthily, and so dangerous to them
that will presume to receive it unworthily: my duty is to exhort you to
consider the dignity of the holy mystery, and the great peril of the
unworthy receiving thereof, and so to search and examine your own
consciences, as you should come holy and clean to a most godly and heavenly
feast, so that in no wise you come but in the marriage garment required of God
in holy Scripture, and so come and be received, as worthy partakers of such a
heavenly Table. The way and means thereto, is: First to examine your lives and
conversation by the rule of Gods commandments, and wherein so ever ye shall
perceive your selves to have offended, either by will, word, or deed, there
bewail your own sinful lives, and confess your selves to Almighty God, with
full purpose of amendment of life. And if ye shall perceive your offenses to
be such, as be not only against God, but also against your neighbors: then ye
shall reconcile your selves unto them, ready to make restitution and
satisfaction, according to the uttermost of your powers, for all injuries and
wrongs done by you to any other, and likewise being ready to forgive other
that have offended you, as you would have forgiuensse of your offenses at Gods
hand: For otherwise the receiving of the holy Communion does nothing else but
increase your damnation. And because it is requisite that no man should come to
the holy Communion, but with a full trust in Gods mercy, and with a quiet
conscience: therefore if there be any of you, which by the means aforsaid
cannot quiet his own conscience, but requires further comfort or counsel,
then let him come to me, or some other discreet and learned Minister of Gods
word, and open his grief, that he may receive such ghostly counsel, advice,
and comfort, as his conscience may be relieved, and that by the ministry of
Gods word he may receive comfort, and the benefit of absolution, to the
quieting of his conscience, and avoiding of all scruple and doubtfulnesse.

Then shall the Priest say this exhortation.

DEarly beloved in the Lord, ye that mind to come to the holy Communion of
the body and blood of our Savior Chris, must conder what S. Paul writes to
the Corinthians, how he exhorts all persons diligently to try and examine
themselves, before they presume to eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.
For as the benefit is great, if with a true penitent heart and lively faith we
receive that holy Sacrament (for them we spiritually eat the flesh of Christ
and drink his blood, then we dwell in Christ, and Christ in us, we be one with
Christ, and Christ with us:) So is the danger great, if we receive the same
unworthily. For then we be guilty of the body and blood of Christ our
Savior: we eat and drink our own damnation, not considering the Lords
body: we kindle Gods wrath against us: we provoke him to plague us with diverse
disease, and sundry kinds of death. Therefore it any of you be a blasphemer
of God, an hinderer or slaunderer of his word, an adulterer, or be in malice
or envy, or in any other grievous crime, be walie our sins, and come not to
this holy table, least after the taking of that holy Sacrament, the devil
enter into you, as he entered into Judas, and fill you full of all iniquities,
and bring you to destruction both of body and soul. Judge therefore your
selves (brethren) that ye be not judged of the Lord. Repent you truly for
your sins past: have a lively and steadfast faith in Christ our Savior. Amend
your lives, and be in perfect charity with all men, so shall ye be meet
partakers of those holy mysteries. And above al things, ye must give most
humble and hearty thanks to God the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, for
there demption of the world, by the death and passion of our Savior Christ,
both God and man, who did humble himself even to the death upon the cross, for
us miserable sinners, which lay in darkness and shadow of death, he might
make us the children of God, and exalt us to everlasting life. And to the end
that we should always remember the exceeding great love of our master and
only Savior Jesus Christ, thus dying for us, and the innumerable benefits
which by his precious blood shedding he has obtained to us: he has
instituted and ordained holy mysteries, as pledges of his love, and continual
remembrance of his death, to our great and endless comfort. To him therefore,
with the Father, and the holy Ghost, let us give (as we are most bounden)
cominuall thanks, submitting our selves whloly to his holy will and pleasure,
and studying to serve him in true holiness and right ou^nesse all the days
of our life. Amen.

Then shall the Priest say to them that come to receive the holy Communion.

YOu that do truly and earnestly repent you of your sins, and be in love
and charity with your neighbors, and intend to lead a new life, folloing the
commandments of God, and walking from henceforth in his holy ways: Draw
near, and take this holy Sacrament to your comfort, make your humble
confession to almighty God, before this congregation here gathered together
in his holy Name, meekely kneeling upon your knees.

Then shall this general confession be made, in the name of all those that are
minded to receive the holy Communion, either by one of them, or else by one of
the Ministers, or by the Prist himself, all kneeling humbly upon their knees.

Almighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, maker of all things, Judge of
all men, we knowledge and bewail our manifold sins and wickedness, which we
from time to time most grievously have committed, by thought, word, and deed,
against thy divine Majesty, provoking mostiustly thy wrath and indignation
against us. We do earnestly repent, and be heartily sorry for these our
misdoings, the remembrance of them is grievous unto us, have mercy upon us,
most merciful Father, for thy son our Lord Jesus Christ sake, forgive us all
that is past, and grant that we may ever here after serve and please thee, in
newness of life, to the honor and glory of thy name, through Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen

Then shall the Priest the Bishop (being present) stand up, and tur^ning
himself to the people, say thus.

Almighty God our heavenly Father, who of his great mercy has promised
forgiveness of sins to all them which with hearty repentance and true faith
turn unto him: Have mercy upon you, pardon and deliver you from all your
sins, confirm and strengthen you in all goodness, and bring you to
everlasting life, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Then shall the Priest also say.

Hear what comfortable words our Saniour Christ faith unto all that truly
turn to him. Come unto me all that travel and be heavy laden, and I will
refresh you. So God loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, to
the end that all that believe in him, should not perish, but have life
everlasting.

Hear also what S. Paul says.

This is a true saying, and worthy of all men to be received, that Jesus
Christ came into the world to save sinners.

Hear also what S. John says.

If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
Righteous, and he is the propitiation for our sins.

After which the Pries shall proceed, saying.

Lift up your hearts.

Answer. We lift them up unto the Lord.

Priest Let us give thanks unto our Lord God.

Answer. It is meet and right so to do.

Priest. It is very meet, right, and our bounden duty, that we should at
all times, and in all places, give thanks unto thee, O Lord holy Father,
almighty everlasting God.

Here shall follow the proper preface, according to the time, if there be any
specially appointed: or else immediately shall follow,

Therefore with Angels and Archangels, etc.

Proper prefaces.
Upon Christmas day, and seven days after. BEcause thou did give Jesus
Christ thine only Son to be borne as this day for us, who by the operation
of the holy Ghost, was made very man of the substance of the virgin Mary his
mother, and that without spot of sin, to make us clean from all sin.
Therefoe with Angels and Archangels, etc. Upon Easter day, and seven days
after. But chiefly are we bound to praise thee, for the glorious resurrection
of thy son Jesus Christ our Lord: for he is the very Paschall Lamb which was
offered for us, and has taken away the sin of the world, who by his death
has destroyed death, and by his rising to life again, has restored to us
everlasting life. Therefore with Angels, etc. Upon the Ascension day, and seven
days after. THrough thy most dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who
after his most glorious resurrection manifestly appeared to al his Apostles,
and in their fight ascended up into heaven, to prepare a place for us, that
where he is, thither might we also aseend, and reign with him in glory.
Therefore with Angels gels and Archangels, etc. Upon Whitsunday, and six days
after. THrough Jesus Christ our Lord, according to whose most true promise the
holy Ghost came down this day from heaven, with a sudden great sound, as it
had been a mighty wind, in the likeness of fiery tongues, lighting upon
the Apostles, to teach them, and to lead them to all truth, giving them both
the gift of diverse languages, and also boldenes with fervent zeal, constantly
to preaech the Gospel unto al nations, whereby we are brought out of darkness
and error, into the clear light and true knowledge of thee, and of thy son
Jesus Christ. Therefore with Angels, etc. Upon the feast of Trinity only. IT
is is very meet, right, and out bounden duty, that we should at all times and
in all places, give thanks to thee, O Lord, almighty and everlasting God,
which art one God, one Lord, not one only person, but three persons in one
substance. For that whicht we believe of the glory of the father, the same we
believe of the Son, and of the holy Ghost, without any difference, or
inequalite. Therefore etc.
After which prefaces, shall follow immediately.

Therefore with angels and archangels, and with all the company of heaven, we
laud and magnify thy glorious name, ever more praising thee, and saying,
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts Heaven and earth are full of thy glory.
Glory be to thee, O Lord most high.

Then shall the Priest kneeling down at Gods board say, in the name of al them
that shall receive the Communion, this prayer following.

WE do not presume to come to this thy table (O merciful Lord) trusting in
our own righteousness, but in thy manifold and great mercies. We be not
worthy so much as to gather up the (...) under thy table. But thou art the same
Lord, whose property is always to have merry: grant us therefore gracious
Lord, so to eat the flesh of thy dear Son Jesus Christ, and to drink the
blood, that our sinful bodies may be made clean by his body, and our souls
washed through his most precious blood, and that we may evermore dwell in him,
and he in us, Amen.

Then the Priest standing up, shall say as follows.

Almighty God, our heauenty Father, which of thy tender mercy did give
thy only Son Jesus Christ to suffer death upon the Cross for our
redemption, who made there (by his one oblation of himself once offered) a
full, perfect, and sufficient Sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction for the
sins of the whole world, and did institute, and in his holy Gospel command
us to continue a perpetual memory of that his precious death, until his
conuning agane: Hear us, o merciful Father, we beseech thee, and grant that
we, receiving these thy creatures of bread and wine, according to thy Son
our Savior Jesus Christ's holy institution, in remembrance of his death and
passion, may be partakers of his most blessed body and blood: who in the same
night that he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he
brake it, and gave it to his Disciples, saying, Take, eat, this is my body,
which is given for you, do this in remembrance of me. Like wise after supper
he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying,
Drink ye all of this, for this is my blood of the new Testament, which is
shed for you and for many for the remissin of sins: do this as off as ye
shall drink it, in remembrance of me.

Then shall the Minister first receive the Communion in both kinds himself,
and next deliver it to other Ministers (if any be there present) that they may
help the chief Minister, and after to the people in their hands, kneeling.
And when he delivers the bread, he shall say.

The body of our Lord Jesus Christ which was given for thee, preserve thy body
and soul into everlasting life; and take and eat this in remembrance that
Christ dyed for thee, and feed on him in thine heart by faith, with
thanksgiving.

And the Minister that delivers the cup, shall say:

The blood of our Lord Jesus Christ which was shed for thee, preserve thy body
and soul into everlasting life: and drink this in remembrance that Christ's
blood was shed for thee, and be thankful.

Then shall the Priest say the Lords prayer, the people repeating after him
every petition. After shall be said as follows.

O Lord and heavenly Father, we thy humble feruants entirely desire thy
fatherly goodness, mercifully to accept this our sacrifice of praise and
thanksgiving, most humbly beseeching thee to grant, that by the merits and
death of thy son Jesus Christ, and through faith in his blood, we and all
thy whole Church may obtain remission of our sins, and all other benefits
of his passion. And here we offer and present unto thee, O Lord, our selves,
our souls and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and lively sacrifice unto
thee, humbly beseeching thee, that all we which be partakers of this holy
Communion, may be fulfilled with thy gracc and heavenly benediction. And
although we be unworthy, through our manifold sins, to offer vuto thee any
sacrifice: yet we beseech thee to accept this our bounden duty and service,
not weighing our merits, but pardoning our offenses, though Jesus Christ our
Lord, by whom, and with whom, in the unity of the holy Ghost, all honor and
glory be unto thee, O Farther almighty, world without end. Amen.

Or this.

ALmighty and everliving God, we most heartily thank thee, that thou do
bouchsafe to feed us which have duly received these holy mysteries, with the
spiritual food of the most precious boby and bloob of thy son our savior
Jesus Christ, and do assure us, thereby of thy favor and goodness to ward
us, and that we be very members incorporate in thy mystical body, which is
the blessed company of all faithful people, and be also heirs though hope, of
thy euerlisting kingdom, by the merits of the most precious death and passion
of thy dear Son: we now most humbly beseech thee, O heavenly Father, so to
assist us with thy grace, that we many continue in that holy fellowship, and do
all such good works as thou have prepared for us to walk in, through Jesus
Christ our Lord, to whom with thee and the holy Ghost, be all honor and glory,
world without end. Amen.

Then shall be said or sung

Glory be to God on hie, and in earth peace, good will toward men. We praise
thee, we bless thee, we worship thee, we glorify thee, we give thanks to thee
for thy great glory, O Lord GOD heavenly king, God the Father almighty, O
Lord, the only begotten son Jesus Christ, O Lord GOD, Lamb of God, son of
the Father, that take away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us. Thou
that take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer. Thou that fittest
at the right hand of God the Father, have mercy upon us. For thou only art
holy, thou only art the Lord, thou only O Christ, with the holy Ghost, art
most high in the glory of god the father. Amen.

Then the Priest, or the Bishop, if he be present, slall let them depart with
this blessing.

The peace of God which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds
in the knowledge, and love of God, and of his son Jesus Christ our Lord: and
the blessing of God almighty, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, be
amongst you, and remain with you always. Amen.

Collects to be said after the offertorie, when there is no Communion, every
such day one. And the same may be said also as often as occasion shall serve.
After the Collects either of Morning and Evening prayer, Communion, or Letanie,
by the discretion of the Minister.

ASsist us mercifully O Lord, in these our supplications and prayers, and
dispose the way of thy servants toward the attainement of everlasting
salvation, that among all ye changes and chances of this mortal life, they may
ever be defended by thy most gracious and ready help, though Christ our
Lord. Amen.

O Almighty Lord and everliving God, vouchsafe, we beseech, thee to direct,
sanctify and govern, both our hearts and bodies in the ways of thy laws,
and in the works of thy commandments, that through thy most mighty protection,
both here and ever, we may be preserved in body and soul, though our Lord and
savior Jesus Christ. Amen.

Grant we beseech thee almighty God, that the words which we have heard
this day with our outward ears, may though thy grace be so graffed inwardly in
our hearts, that they may bring forth in us the fruit of good living, to the
honor and praise of thy name, though Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings, with thy most gracious favor, and
further Us with thy continual help, that in all our works begum, continucd,
and ended in the, we may glorify thy holy Name, and finally by thy mercy
obtain everlasting life, though Jesus Christ out Lord. Amen.

Almighty GOD, the fountain of all wisdom, which know our neccssities
before we ask, and our ignorance in asking: we beseech thee to have
compassion upon out infirmities, and those things which for our unworthiness
we dare not, and for our blindness we cannot ask, vouchsafe to give us for
the worthiness of thy son Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

Almighty god, which have promised to hear the petitions of them that ask in
thy sons name, we beseech thee mercifully to incline thine ears to us that
have made now our prayers and supplications unto thee, and grant that those
things which we have faithfully asked according to thy will, may effectually
be obtained, to the relief of our necessity, and to the setting forth of thy
glory, though Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

Upon the holy days (if there be no Communion) shall be said all that is
appointed at the Communion, until the end of the Homily, concluding with the
general prayer (for the whole estate of Chrifstes Church militant here in
earth) and one or more of these Collects before rehearsed, as occasion shall
serve.

And there shall be no celebration of the Lords Supper except there be a good
number to communicate with the Priest, according to his discretion.

And if there be not above twenty persons in the Parish, of discretion to
receive the Communion, yet there shall be no Communion, except four or three
at the least communicate with the Priest.

And in Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, where be many Priests and Deacons,
they shall all receive the Communion with the Minister every Sunday at the
least, except they have a reasonable cause to the contrary.

And to take away the superstition, which any person has or might have in the
bread and wine, it shall suffice that the bread be such as is usually to be
eaten at the table with other meats, but the best and purest wheat bread that
conveniently may be gotten. And if any of the bread and wine remain, the
Curate shall have it to his own use.

The bread and wine for the Communion shall be provided by the Curate and the
Churchwardens, at the charges of the Parish, and the Parish shall be discharged
of such sums of money or other duties, which hitherto they have paid for
the same by order of their houses every Sunday.

And note that every Parishioner shall communicate at the least three times in
the year, of which Easter to be one, and shall also receive the Sacraments
and other Rites, according to the order in this book appointed. And yearly at
Easter, every Parishioner shall reckon with his Parson, Vicar, or Curate, or
his or their deputy or deputies, and pay to them or him all Ecclesiastical
duties accustomably due, then and at that time to be paid.

The ministration of Baptism, to be used in the Church.
It appears by ancient writers, that the Sacrament of Baptism in the old
time was not commonly ministered, but at two times in the year: At Caster and
whitfuntide. At which times it was openly ministered in the presence of all the
Congregation. Which custom now being grown out of use (although it cannot for
many considerations be well restored again) it is thought good to follow the
same, as near as conveniently may be. Wherefore the people are to be
admonished, that it is most convenient that Baptism should not be ministered
but upon Sundays and other holidays, when thr most number of people may come
together, as well for that the congregation thet present may testify the
recieuing of them that be newly baptized, into the number of Christ Church, as
also becouse in the Baptism of insants, every man present may be put in
remembrance of his own profession made to God in his baptism. For which cause
also it is expedient that baptism be ministered in the English tongue.
Nevertheless (if necessity so requeire) children may at all times be baptized
at home.

When there are children to be baptized upon the Sunday or holy day, the
parents shall give knowledge over night, or in the morning before the beginning
of Morning prayer, to the Curate. And then the Godfathers, Godmothers, and
people, with the children, must be ready at the Font, either immediately after
the last Lesson at Morning prayer, or else immediately after the last Lesson at
Evening prayer, as the Curate by his discretion shall appoint. And then
standing there, the Priest shall ask whether the children be baptized, or no.
If they answer No: then shall the Priest say thus.

Dearly beloved, forasmuch as all men be conceived and borne in sin, and
that our Savior Christ faith, None can enter into the kingdom of God, except
he be regenerate and borne anew of water and of thr holy Ghost: I beseech you
to call upon God the Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ, that of his
vounteous mercy he will grant to these children that thing which by nature
they cannot have, that they may be baptized with water and the holy Ghost, and
reciued into Christ's holy Church, and be made lively members of the same.

Then shall the Priest say.

Let us pray.

Almighty and everlasting God, which of thy great mercy did faue Noe and
his family in the Arc from perishing by water, and also did safly lead ye
children of Israel thy people through the red sea, figuring thereby thy holy
baptism: and by the baptism of thy well-beloved son Jesus Crist, did
sanctify the flood Jordan and all other waters to the mystical washing away
of fsainne: we beseech thee for thine infinite mercies, that thou will
mercifully look upon these children, sanctify them, and wash them with the
holy Ghost, that they being delivered from thy wrath, may be received into the
Arc of Christ's Church, and being steadfast in faith, joyful through hope, and
rooted in charity, may so pass the waves of this troublesome world, that
finally they may come to the land of eueriasting life, there to reign with
thee world without end, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Almighty and immortal God, the aid of all that need, the helper of all that
slay to thee for succor, the life of them that believe, and the resurrection
of the dead: we call Upon thee for these insants, that they coming to thy holy
Baptism, may receive remission of their sins by spiritual regeneration.
Receive them (O Lord) as thou have promised by thy melbeloued son, saying,
Ask, and you shall have, seek, and you shall find, knock, and it shall be
opened unto you. So give now unto us that ask, let us that seek, find, open
the gate unto us that knock, that these infantes may enjoy the everlasting
benediction of thy heavenly washing and may come to the eternal kingdom which
thou have promised by Christ our Lord. Amen.

Then shall the Priest say.

Hear the words of the Gospel written by S. Mark, in the tenth Chapter.

AT a certain time they brought children to Christ, that he should touch them:
and his disciples rebuked those that bought them. But when Jesus saw it, he
was displeased, and said unto them, Suffer little children to come unto me,
and forbid them not, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Verily I say
unto you, whosoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child,
he shall not enter therein. And when he had taken them up in his arms, he
put his hands upon them, and blessed them.

After the Gospel is read, the Minister shall make this brief exhortation upon
the words of the Gospel.

FRiends, you hear in this Gospel the words of our Savior Christ, that he
commanded the children to be brought unto him, how he blamed those that would
have kept them from him, how he exhorts all men to follow their innocence.
You perceive how by his outward gestuce and deed, he declare his good will
toward them: for he embraced them in his arms, he laid his hands upon them
and blessed them. Doubt ye not therefore but earnestly believe, that he will
like wise favorably receive these Present infants, that he will embrace them
with the arms of his mercy, that he will give unto them the blessing of
eternal life, and make them partakers of his everlasting kingdom. Wherefore,
we being thus persuaded of the good will of our heavenly Father toward these
infants, declared by his son Jesus Christ, and nothing doubting but that he
favorably allows this charitable work of ours, in bringing the children to
his holy baptism: let us faithfully and devoutly give thanks unto him, and
say.

Almighty and everlasting God, heavenly Father, we give thee humble thanks,
that thou have vouchsafed to call us to the knowledge of thy grace and faith in
thee: Increase this knowledge, and confirm this faith in us evermore: Give thy
holy spirit to these infants, that they may be borne again, and be made
heirs of everlasting salvation, through our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives and
reigns with thee and the holy spirit, now and for ever. Amen.

Then the Priest shall speak unto the Godfathers and Godmothers on this wise.

Well-beloved friends, ye have brought these children here to be baptized, ye
have prayed that our Lord Jesus Christ would vouchsafe to receive them, to lay
his hands upon them, to bless them, to release them of their sins, to give
them the kingdom of heaven, and everlasting life. Ye have hear also that our
Lord Jesus Christ has promised in his Gospel, to grant all these things that
ye have prayed for: which promise he for his part will most sarely keep and
perform. Wherefore after this promise made by Christ, these infants must also
faithfully for their part, promise by you that be their sureties, that they
will forsake the devil and all his works, and constantly be leeue Gods holy
word, and obediently keep his commandments.

Then shall the Priest demand of the Godfathers and Godmothers these questions
following. Do thou forsake the devil and all his works, the vain pomp and
glory of the world with all eouetous desires of the same, the carnal desires of
the flesh, so that thou will not follow nor be led by them? Answer. I forsake
them all. Minister. Do thou believe in God the Father almighty, maker of
heaven and earth? And in Jesus Christ his only begotten Son our Lord? And
that he was conceived by the holy Ghost, borne of the virgin Mary, that he
susstreb under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried, that he went
down into hell, and also did rise again the third day, that he afrended into
heaven, and sits at the right hand of God, the Father almighty, and from
thence shall come again at the end of the world, to judge the quick and the
dead? And do thou believe in the holy Ghost, the holy Catholic Church, the
communion of Saints, the remission of sins, the resurrection of the flesh,
and everlasting life after death? Answer. All this I steadfastly believe.
Minister. will thou be baptized in this faith? Answer. That is my desire.


Then shall the Priest say.

Grant that all carnal affections may dye in them, and that all things
belonging to the spirit, may live and grow in them. Amen.

Grant that they may have power and strength to have victory, and to triumph
against the devil, the world and the flesh. Amen.

Grant that whosoever is here dedicated to thee by our office and ministry,
may also be endued with heavenly virtues, and everlastingly rewarded, through
thy mercy, O blesssed Lord God, who do live and gouerue all things, world
without end, Amen.

ALmighty everliving God, whose most dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ, for the
forgiueness of our sins, did shed out of his most precious side both water
and blood, and gave commandment to his Disciples, that they should go teach
all nations, and baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and of the
holy Ghost: Regard, we beseech thee, the spplications of thy congregation, and
grant that all thy servants which shall be baptized in this water, may receive
the fullness of thy grace, and ever remain in the number of thy faithful and
elect children, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

Then the Priest shall take the child in his hands, and ask the name. And
naming the child, shall dip it in the water, so it bediscreetly and warily
done, saying.

N. I baptize thee, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
holy Ghost. Amen.

And if the child be weak, it shall suffice to power water upon it, saying
the foresaid words.

N. I baptize thee, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
holy Ghost, Amen.

Then the Priest shall make a Cross upon the childs forehead, saying.

WE receive this child into the Congregation of Christ flock, and do sign
him with the sign of the Cross, in token that here after he shall not be
ashamed to confess the faith of Christ crucified, and manfully to fight under
his banner, against sin, the world, and the devil, and to continue Christ's
faithful soldier and servant unto his lives end. Amen.

Then shall the Priest say.

SEeing now dearly beloved brethren, that these children be regenerate and
grafted into the body of Christ's congregation, let us give thanks unto God for
these benefits, and with one accord make our prayers unto Almighty God, that
they may lead the rest of their life according to this beginning.

Then shall be said.

Our Father Which art in heaven, etc.

Then shall the Priest say.

WE yield thee hearty thanks, most merciful father, that it has pleased thee
to regenerate this infant with thy holy spirit, to receive him for thine own
child by adoption, and to incorporate him into thy holy congregation. And
humbly we beseech thee to grant, that he being dead unto sin, and living
unto righteousness, and being buried with Christ in his death, may crucify the
old man, and utterly abolish the whole body of sin, that as he is made
partaker of the death of thy son, so he may be partaker of his resurrection,
so that finally, with the resid^e of thy holy Congregation, he may be
inheritout of thine everlasting kingdom, through Christ our Lord, Amen.

At the last end, the Priest calling the Godfathers and Godmothers together,
shall say this exhortation following.

FOrasmuch as these children have promised by you to forsake the devil and at
his works, to believe in God, and to serve him: you must remember that it is
your parts and duties to see that these infants be taught, so soon as they
shall be able to learn, what a solemn vow, promise, and profession they
have made by you. And that they may know these things the better, ye shall call
upon them to hear Sermons, and chiefly you shall provide that they may learn
the Creed, the Lords prayer, and (...) ten Commandments in the English
tongue, and all other things which a Christian man ought to know and believe to
his souls health, and that these children may be virtuously brought up to
lead a godly and a Christian life, remembering always that Baptism does
represent unto us our profession, which is, to follow the example of our
Savior Christ, and to be made like unto him, that as he died, and rose again
for us, so should we which are baptized, die from sin, and rise again unto
righteousness, continually mortifying all our evil and corrupt affections, and
daily proceeding in all bertue and godliness of living.

The Minister that command that the children be brought to the Bishop, to be
confirmed of him, so soon as they can say in their vulgar tongue, the Articles
of the faith, the Lords prayer, and the ten Commandments, and be further
instructed in the Catechism set forth for that purpose according as it is
there expressed.

Of them that are to be baptized in private houses in time of necessity, by
the Minister of the Parish, or any other lawful Minister, that can be procured.
The Pastors and Curates shall often admonish the people, that they defer
not the Baptism of Infants any longer then the Sunday, or other Holy day next
after the child be borne, unless upon a great and reasonable cause declared
to the Curate, and by him approved.

And also they shall warn them, that without great cause and necessity, they
procure not their children to be baptized at home in their houses. And when
great need shall compel them so to do, then Baptism shall be administered on
this fashion.

First let the lawful Minister, and them that be present, call upon God for
his grace, and say the Lords prayer, if the time will suffer. And then the child
being named by some one that is present, the said lawful Minister shall dip it
in water, or power water upon it, saying these words.

N I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy
Ghost. Amen.

And let them not doubt, but that the child so baptized, is lawfully and
sufficiently baptized, and ought not to be baptized again. But yet
nevertheless, if the child which is after this sort baptized, do afterward
live, it is expedient that it be brought into the Church, to the intent that
if the Priest or Minister of the same parish did himself baptize that child,
the Congregation may be certified of the true form of Baptism by him
privately before used: Or if the child were baptized by any other lawful
Minister, that then the Minister of the Parish, where the child was borne or
Christened, shall examine and try, whether the child be lawfully baptized or
no. In which case, if those that bring any child to the Church, do answer
that the same child is already baptized, then shall the Minister examine them
further, saying.

By whom was the child baptized?

Who was present when child was baptized?

And because some things, Essential to this Sacrament, may happen to be
omitteb through fear or haste in such times of extremity; therefore I demand
further of you, With what matter was the child baptized?

With what words was the child baptized?

Whether think you the child to be lawfully and perfectly baptized?

And if the Minister shall find by the answers of such as bring the child,
that all things were done as they ought to be: then shall not he Christen the
child again, but shall receive him as one of the slocke of the true Christian
people, saying thus.

I Certify you, that in this case all is well done, and according unto due
order concerning the baptizing of this child, which being borne in original
sin, and in the wrath of God, is now by the lauer of regeneration in
baptism, received into the number of the children of God, and heirs of
everlasting life. For our Lord Jesus Christ does not deny his grace and merey
unto such Infants, but most lovingly does call them unto him, as the holy
Gospel does witness to our comfort on this wise.

AT a certain time they brought children unto Christ that he should touch
them, and his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it,
Mark 10.13.
he was displeased, and said unto them, Suffer little children to come unto me,
and forbid them not, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Verily I say
unto you, whosoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child,
he shall not enter therein. And when he had taken them up in his arms, he
put his hands upon them, and blessed them.

After the Gospel is read, the Minister shall make this exhortation upon the
words of the Gospel.

FRiends, you hear in this Gospel the words of our Savior Christ, that the
commanded the children to be brought unto him, how he blamed those that would
have kept them from him, how he exhorted all men to follow their innocence.
Ye perceive how by his outward gesture and deed, he declared his good will
toward them. For he embraced them in his arms, he laid his hands upon them,
and blessed them. Doubt ye not therefore, but earnestly believe, that he has
like wise favorably received this present infant, that he has embraced him
with the arms of his mercy, that he has given unto him the blessing of
eternal life, and made him partaker of his everlasting kingdom. Wherefore we
being thus persuaded of the good will of our heavenly Father, declared by his
son Jesus Christ toward this infant, let us faithfully and devoutly give
thanks unto him, and say the prayer which the Lord himself thaught, and in
declaration of our faith, let us recite the Articles contained in our Creed.

Here the Minister, with the Godfathers and Godmothers, shall say.

Our Father which art in heaven, etc.

Then shall the Priest demand the name of the child, which being by the
Godfathers and Godmothers pronounced, the Minister shall say.

Do thou in the name of this child forsake the Devil and all his works, the
baine pomp and glory of the world, with all the covetous desires of the same,
the carnal desires of the (...) and not to follow and be led by them?

Answer.

I forsake them all.

Minister.

Do thou in the name of this child profess this faith, to believe in God
the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth? And in Jesus Christ his only
begotten son our Lord? And that he was conceived by the holy Ghost, borne of
the Virgin Marie, that he suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead,
and buried, that he went down into hell, and also did rise again the third
day, that he ascended into heaven, and fitteth at the right hand of God the
Father Almighty, and from thence he shall come again at the end of the world to
judge the quick and the dead? And do you in his name believe in the holy
Ghost, the holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the remission of
sins, reserrection, and everlasting life after death?

Answer. All this I steadfastly believe.

Let us pray.

Then shall the Minister make this exhortation to the Godfathers and
Godmothers.

FOrasmuch as this child has promised by you, to forsake the devil and all
his works, to believe in God, and to serve him: you must remember that it is
your part and duty, to see that this infant be taught, so soon as he shall
be able to learn, what a solemn vow, promise, and profession he has made
by you. And that he may know these things the better, ye shall call upon him to
hear Sermons, and chiefly you shall provide that he may learn the Creed,
the Lords Prayer, and the ten commandments in the English tongue, and all
other things which a Christian man ought to know, and believe to his souls
health, and that this child may be virtuously brought up, to lead a godly and
a Christian life, remembering always that Baptism does represent dnto us our
profession, which is, to follow the example of our Saniour Christ, and be made
like unto him, that as he died and rose again for us, so should we which are
baptized, die from sin, and rise again unto righteousness, continually
mortifying all our evil and corrupt affections, and daily proceeding in all
virtue and godliness of living.

And so forth, as in Public Baptism.

But if they which bring the Infants to the Church, do make such uncertain
answers to the Priests questions, as that it cannot appear, that the child
was baptized with water, In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost: which are Essential parts of Baptism; then let the Priest
baptize it in form above written, concerning Public Baptism, saving that at
the dipping of the child in the Font, hec shall use this form of words.

IF thou be not already baptized, N. I baptized thee in the Name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost, Amen.

The Order of Confirmation, or laying on of hands upon children baptized, and
able to render an account of their faith, according to the Catechism following.
TO the end that Confirmation may be ministered to the more edifying of such as
shall receive it (according to Saint Paul's doctrine, who teaches that all
things should be done in the Church to the edificatio^ of the same) it is
thought good, that none hereafter shall be Confirmed, but such as can say in
their mother tongue the Articles of the faith, the Lords Prayer, and the ten
Commandments and can also answer to such questions of this short Catechism,
as the Bishop (or such as he shall appoint) shall by his discretion appose him
in. And this order is most convenient to be observed, for diverse considerations.

First, bccause that when children come to the years of discretion, and have
learned what their Godfathers and Godmothers promised for them in Baptism,
they may then themselves with their own mouth, and with their own consent,
openly before the Church, ratify and confirm the same: and also promise that
by the grace of God, they will evermore endeavor themselves faithfully to
observe and keep such things as they by their own mouth and confession have
assented unto.

Secondly, forasmuch as Confirmation is ministered to them that be baptized,
that by imposition of hands and Prayer, they may receive strengch and defense
against all temptations to sin and the assaults of the world and the devil,
it is most meet to be ministered when children come to that age, that partly by
the frailty of their own flesh, partly by the assaults of the world and the
devil, they begin to be in danger to fall into sundry kinds of sin.

Thirdly, for that it is agreeable with the usage of the Church in times past:
whereby it was ordained that Confirmation should be ministered to them that were
of perfect age, that they being instructed in Christ's Religion, should openly
profess their own faith, and promise to be obedient unto the will of God.

And that no man shall think that any detriment shall come to children by
differing of their Confirmation, he shall know for truth, that it is certain
by Gods word, that children being baptized, have all things necessary for their
salvation, and bevndoubtedly saved.

A Catechism, that is to say, An instruction to be learned of every child,
before he be brought to be confirmed by the Bishop.
WHat is your name?

Answer. N. or M.

Question. Who gave you this name?

Answer. My Godfather and Godmothers in my Baptism, wherein I was made a
member of Christ, the child of God, and an inheritour of the kingdom of
heaven.

Question. What did your Godfathers and Godmothers then for your?

Answer. They did promise and vow three things in my name. First, that I
should forske the devil and all his works, and pompes, the vanities of the
wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of the flesh. Secondly, that I should
believe all the Articles of the Christian faith. And thirdly, that I should
keep Gods holy will and Commandments, and walk in the same all the days of
my life.


Question. Do thou not think that thou art bound to believe, and to do as
they have promised for thee?

Answer. Yes verily: and by Gods help so I will. And I heartily thank our
heavenly Father, that he has called me to this state of salvation, through
Jesus Christ our Savior. And I pray God to give me his grace, that I may
continue in the same unto my lives end.

Question. Rehearse the Articles of thy belief.

Answer. I Believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth. And
in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, which was conceived by the holy
Ghost, borne of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified,
dead and buried, he descended into hell, the third day he rose again from
the dead, he ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the
Father Almighty: From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I
believe in the holy Ghost, the holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints,
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life
everlasting. Amen.

Question. What do thou chiefly learn in these Articles of thy belief?

Answer. First, I learn to believe in God the Father, who has made me and
all the world. Secondly in God the Son, who has redeemed me and all
mankind. Thirdly in God the holy Ghost, who sanctifies me and all the elect
people of God.


Question. You said that your Godfathers and Godmothers did promise for you,
that you should keep Gods Commandments. Tell me bow many there be.

Answer. Ten.

Question. Which be they?

Answer. THe same which God spoke in the twentieth Chapter of Exodus, saying,
I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of
the house of boundage. i. Thou shall have none other gods but me. ii. Thou
shall not make to thy self any graven image, nor the likeness of any thing
that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the water under the
earth. Thou shall not bow down to them, nor worship them. For I the Lord thy
God am a ielous God, and bisite the sins of the fathers upon the children,
unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and show mercy
unto thousands in them that love me, and keep my Commandments. iii. Thou
shall not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold
him guiltless that takes his Name in vain. iiii. Remember that thou keep
holy the Sabbath day. Six days shall thou labor, and do all that thou have
to do, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou shall
do no manner of work, thou and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man servant,
and thy maid servant, thy cattle, and the stranger that is within thy gates.
For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them
is, and rested the seunth day: wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and
hallowed it. v. Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in
the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee. vi. Thou shall do no murder.
vii. Thou shall not commit adultery. viii. Thou shall not steal. ix. Thou
shall not bear false witness against neighbor. x. Thou shall not covet thy
neighbors house, thou shall not covet thy neighbous wife, nor his servant,
nor his maid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is his.


Question. What do thou chiefly learn by these commandments?

Answer. I learn two things: My duty toward God, and my duty toward my
neighbor?

Question. What is thy duty toward God?

Answer. My duty toward God is, to believe in him, to fear him, and to
love him with all my heart, with all my mind, with all my soul, and with all
my strength. To worship him, to give him thanks, to put my whole trust in him,
to call upon him, to honor his holy Name and his word, and to serve him truly
all the days of mhy life.

Question. What is thy duty to wards thy neighbor?

Answer. My duty toward my neighbor, is to love him as my self, and to do
to all men, as I would they should do unto me. To love, honor, and succor
my father and mother. To honor and obey the king and his ministers. To submit
my self to all my governors, teachers, spiritual Pastors and masters. To
order my self lowly and reverently to all my betters. To hurt no body by word
or deed. To be true and just in all my dealing. To bear no malice nor hatred
in my heart. To keep my hands from picking and stealing, and my tongue from
evil speaking, lying, and slandering. To keep my body in temperance,
soberness, and chastitic. Not to covet nor desre other men's goods, but to
learn and labor truly to get mine own living, and to do my duty in that
state of life, unto the which it shall please God to call me.

Question. My good child know thhis, that thou art not able to do these
things of thy self, nor to walk in the comandements of God, and to serve him,
without his special grace, which thou must learn at all times to call for by
diligent prayer. Let me hear threfore if thou can the Lords prayer.

Answer. OUr Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom
come. Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily
bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against
us. And lead us not into temptation: but deliver us from evil. Amen.

Question. What desire thou of God in this prayer?

Answer. I desire my Lord God our heavenly Father, who is the giver of all
goodness, to send his grace unto me, and to all people, that we may worship
him, serve him, and obey him, as we ought to do. And I pray unto God, that he
will send us all things that be needful, both for our souls and bodies, and
that he will be merciful unto us, and forgive us our sins, and that it
will please him to save and defend us in all dangers ghostly and bodily, and
that he will keep us from all sun and wickedness, and from our ghostly
enemy, and from everlasting death. And this I trust he will do of his mercy
and goodness, through our Lord Jesus Christ. And therefore I say, Amen. So be
it.

So soon as the children can say in their mother tongue the Articles of the
faith, the Lords prayer, the ten Commandments, and also can answer to such
questions of this short Catechism, as the Bishop (or such as he shall
appoint) shall by his discretion appose them in: then shall they be brought to
the Bishop by one that shall be his Godfather, or Godmother, that every child
may have a witness of his confirmation. And the Bishiop shall confirm them on
this wise.

Confirmation, or laying on of hands.
OUr help is in the Name of the Lord.

Answer. Which has made Heaven and Earth.

Minister. Blessed be the Name of the Lord.

Answer. Henceforth world without end.

Minister. Lord hear our prayers.

Answer. And let our cry come unto thee.

Let us pray.

Then the Bishop shall lay his hand upon every child severally, saying.

Defend, O Lord, this child with thy heavenly grace, that he may continue
thine for ever, and daily increase in thy holy spirit more and more, until he
come unto thy everlasting kingdom. Amen.

Then shall the Bishop say.

Let us pray.

Then the Bishop shall bless the children, saying thus.

The blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, be
upon you, and remain with you for cuer. Amen.

The Curate of every Parish, or some other at his appointment, shall diligently
upon Sundays and Holy days, half an hour before Euensong, openly in the
Church, instruct and examine so many children of his Parish sent unto him, as
the time will serve, and as he shall think convenient, in some part of this
Catechism.

And all Fathers, Mothers, Masters, and Dames, shall cause their children,
servants and prentices, (which have not learned their Catechism) to come to
the Church at the time appointed, and obediently to hear, and be ordered by
the Curate, until such time as they have learned all that is here appointed
for them to learn. And whenever the Bishop shall give knowledge for children
to be brought before him to any convenient place for their confirmation, then
shall the Curate of every Parish, either bring or send in writing the names of
all those children of his Parish, which can say the Articles of the faith, the
Lords prayer, and the ten Commandments, and also how many of them can answer
to the other questions contained in this Catechism.

And there shall none be admitted to the holy Communion, until such time as
he can say the Catechism, and be confirmed.

The form of solemnization of Matrimony.
First, the Banes must be asked three several Sundays or holy days, in the
time of service, the people being present after the accustomed manner.

And if the persons that should be married, dwell in diners Parishes, the Banes
must be asked in both Parishes: and the Curate of the one Parish shall not
solemnize Matrimony betwixt them, without a Certificate of the Banes being
thrice asked, from the Curate of the other Parish.

At the day appointed for solemnization of Matrimony, the persons to be
married, shall come into the body of the Church, with their friends and
neighbors And there the Priest shall say thus.

Dearly beloved friends, we are gathered together here in the sight of God,
and in the face of his Congregation, to join together this man and this woman
in holy Matrimony, which is an honorable estate, instituted of God in
Paradise, in the time of man's innocence, signifying unto us the mystical union
that is betwixt Christ and his Church: which holy estate Christ adorned and
beautified with his presence, and first miracle that he wrought in Cana of
Galilee, and is commended of S. Paul to be honorable among all men, and
therefore is not to be enterprised nor taken in hand unadvisedly, lightly, or
wantonly, to satisfy men's carnal lusts and appetites, like brute beasts that
have no understanding, but reverently, discreetely, advisedly, soberly, and in
the fear of God, duly considering the causes for which Matrimony was
ordained. One was, the procreation of children, to be brought up in the fear
and nurture of the Lord, and praise of God, Secondly it was ordained for a
remedy against sin, and to avoid fornication, that such persons as have not
the gift of continency, might marry, and keep themselves undefiled members
of Christ's body. Thirdly, for the mutual society, hilpe, and comfort, that the
one ought to have of the other, both in prosperity and adversity, into the
which holy estate these two persons present come now to be joined. Therefore if
any man can show any just cause, why they may not lawfully be joined together,
let him now speak, or else hereafter for ever hold his peace.

And also speaking to the persons that shall be married, he shall say.

I Require and charge you (as you will answer at the dreadful day of
judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed) that if either of
you do know any impediment, why ye may not be lawfully joined together in
Matrimony, that ye confess it. For be ye well assured, that so many as be
coupled together otherwise then Gods word does allow, are not joined together
by God, neither is their Matrimony lawful.

At which day of marriage, if any man do allege and declare any impediment, why
they may not be coupled together in Matrimony, by Gods law or the laws of
this Realm, and will be bound, and sufficient suerties with him to the parties,
or else put in a caution to the full value of such charges as the persons to be
married do sustain, to prove his allegation: then the solemnization must be
deferred, unto such time as the truth be tried. If no impediment be alleged,
then shall the Curate say unto the man.

N. Will thou have this woman to thy wedded wife, to live together after Gods
ordinance, in the holy estate of Matrimony? Will thou love her, comfort her,
honor, and keep her in sickness and in health? and forsaking all other,
keep thee only unto her, so long as you both shall live?

The man shall answer.

I will.

Then shall the Priest say unto the woman.

N. Will thou have this man to thy wedded husband, to live together after Gods
ordinance, in the holy estate of Matrimony? will thou obey him, and serve him,
love, honor, and keep him in sickness and in health? and forsaking all
other, keep thee only unto him, so long as you both shall live?

The woman shall answer.

I will.

Then shall the Minister say.

Who gives this woman to be married to this man?

And the Minister receiving the woman at her fathers or friends hands, shall
cause the man to take the woman by the right hand, and so either to give their
troth to other, the man first saying.

IN. take thee N. to my wedded wife, to have and to hold, from this day
forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in
health, to love, cherish, and to obey, till death us depart, according to Gods
holy ordinance: and thereto I give thee my troth.

Then shall they loose their hands, and the woman taking again the man by the
right hand, shall say.

IN. take thee N. to my wedded husband, to have and to hold, from this day
forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in
health, to love, cherish, and to obey, till death us depart, according to Gods
holy ordinance: and thereto I give thee my troth.

Then shall they again loose their hands, and the man shall give unto the
woman a Ring, laying the same upon the book, with the accustomed duty to the
Priest and Clarke. And the Priest taking the Ring, shall deliver it unto the
man to put it upon the fourth finger of the woman's left hand. And the man
taught by the Priest, shall say.

With this Ring I thee web, with my body I thee worship, and with all my
worldly goods I thee endow: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the holy Ghost. Amen.

Then the man leaving the Ring upon the fourth finger of the woman's left hand,
the Minister shall say.

Let us pray.

Then shall the Priest join their right hands together, and say.

Those whom God has joined together, let no man put asvnder.

Then shall the Minister speak unto the people.

FOrasmuch as N. and N. have consented together in holy wedlock, and have
witnessed the same before God and this company, and thereto have given and
pledged their troth either to other, and have declared the same by giving and
receiving of a Ring, and by joining of hands, I pronounce that they be man and
wife together, In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the holy Ghost.
Amen.

And the Minister shall add this blessing.

GOD the Father, God the Son, God the holy Ghost, bless, preserve, and keep
you, the Lord mercifully with his favor look upon you, and so fill you with
all spiritual benediction and grace, that you may so live together in this
life, that in the world to come you may have life everlasting, Amen.

Then the Minister or Clearkes going to the Lords table, shall say or sing this
Psalm following.

BLessed are al they that fear the Lord: and walk in his ways. Beari omnes.
Psalm. 128.


For thou shall eat the labor of thy hands: O well is thee, and happy shall
thou be.

Thy wife shall be as the fruitful Vine: upon the walls of thy house.

Thy children like the Olive branches: round about thy table.

Lo, thus shall the man be blessed: that fears the Lord.

The Lord from out of Sion shall so bless thee: that thou shall see Jerusalem
in prosperity all thy life long.

Yea, that thou shall see thy childrens children: and peace upon Israel.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the holy Ghost.

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.

Or this Psalm.

GOD be merciful unto us, Deus misereatur. Psalm. 67
and bless us: and show us the light of his countenance, and be merciful unto
us.

That thy way may be known upon the earth: thy saving health among all nations.

Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise thee.

O let the nations rejoice and be glad: for thou shall judge the folk
righteously, and govern the nations upon the earth.

Let the people praise thee, O God: let all the people praise thee.

Then shall the earth bring forth her increase: and God, men our olvne God,
shall give us his blessing.

God shall bless us: and all the ends of the world shall fear him.

Glory be to the Father, etc.

As it was in the beginning, etc.

The Psalm ended, and the man and the woman kneeling before the Lords Table,
the Priest standing at the Table, and turning his face toward them, shall say.

Lord have mercy upon us.

Answer. Christ have merry upon us.

Minister. Lord have mercy upon us.

Our Father which art in heaven, etc.

And lead us not into tempatation.

Answer. But deliver us from evil. Amen.

Minister. O Lord save thy servant, and thy handmaid.

Answer. Which put their trust in thee.

Minister. O Lord send them help from thy holy place.

Answer. And evermore defend them.

Minister. Be unto them, a tower of strength.

Answer. From the face of their enemy.

Minister. O Lord hear our prayer.

Answer. And let our cry come unto thee.

Minister. O God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, bless these thy
servants, and sow the seed of eternal life in their minds, that whatsoever
in thy holy word they shall profitably learn, they may in deed fulfill the
same. Look, O Lord, mercifully upon them from heaven, and bless them. And as
thou did send thy blessing upon Abraham and Sara, to their great comfort:
So vouchsase to send thy blessing upon these thy servants, that they obeying
thy will, and always being in safety under protection, may abide in thy love
unto their lives end, through Jesus Christ ou Lord. Amen.

This prayer next following, shall be omitted, where the woman is past child
birth.

O Merciful Lord and heavenly Father, by whose gracious gift mankind is
increased: we beseech thee assist with thy blessing these two persons, that
they may both be fruitful in procreation of children, and also live together
so long in godly love and honesty, that they may see their childrens children,
unto the third and fourth generation, unto thy praise and honor, through
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

O God, which by thy mighty power have made all things of naught, which also
(after other things set in order) did appoint that one of man (created after
thine own image and sinulitude) woman should take her beginning: and knitting
them together, did teach that it should never be lawful to put asvnder
those, whom thou by Matrimony had made one: O God, which have consecrated
the state of Matrimony to sush and excellent my sterie, that in it is
signified and represented the spirtuall marriage and unity betlvixt Christ and
his Church: Look mercifully upon these thy servants, that both this man may
love his wife, according to thy word, (as Christ did love his spouse the
Church, who gave himself for it, loving and cherishing it, even as his own
flesh) and also that this woman may be loving and amiable to her husband as
Rachel, wise as Rebecca, faithful and obedient as Sara, and in all quietness,
sobriety, and peace, be a follower of holy and godly matrons. O Lord, bless
them both, and grant them to inharite thy everlasting kingdom, through Jesus
Chraist our Lord. Amen.

Then shall the Priest say.

Then shall begin the Communion. And after the Gospel, shall be said a Sermon,
wherein ordinarily (so often as there is any marriage) the office of a man and
wife shall be declared, according to holy Scripture. Or if there be no
Sermon, the Minister shall read this that follows.

ALl ye which be married, or which intend to take the holy estate of
Matrimony upon you, hear what holy Scripture does say as touching the duty
of husbands toward their wives, and wives toward their husbands.

Saint Paul in his Epistle to the Ephesians the fifth Chapter, does give this
commandment to all married men, Ye husbands, love your wives, even as Christ
loved the Church, and has given himself for it, to sanctfie it, purging it in
the fountain of water, through the word, that he might make it unto himself
a glorious congregation, not having spot or wrinckle, or any such thing, but
that it should be holy and blameless. So men are bound to love their own
wives, as their own bodies. He that loves his own wife, loves himself: For
never did any man hate his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even
as the Lord does the congregation: for we are members of his body, of his
flesh, and of his bones. For this cause shall a man leave father and mother,
and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This
mystery is great: but I speak of Christ, and of the congregation.
Nevertheless, let every one of you so love his own wife even as himself.

Like wise same Saint Paul writing to the Colossians, Colos. 3.
speaks thus to all men that be married, Ye men love your wives, and be not
bitter unto them.

Hear also what S.Peter the Apostle of Christ, 1. Pet. 3.
which was himself a married man, said unto all men that are married, Ye
husbands, dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor unto the
wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as heirs together of the grace of life,
so that your prayers be not hindered.

Hitherto ye have heard the duty of the hunsband toword the wife. Now
likewife ye wives, hear and learn your duties toward your husbands, even as
it is plainly set forth in holy Scripture.

Saint Paul, Ephesians. 5.
in the forenamed Epistle to the Ephesians, teaches you thus: Ye women, submit
your selves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the
wives head, even as Christ is the head of the Church, and he is also the
Savior of the whole body.

Therefore as the Church or Congregation is subject unto Christ, So likewise
let ye wives also be in subietion unto their own hubands in all things. And
again he says, Let the wife reverence her husband. And in his Epistle to the
Colossians, S.Paul gives you this short lesson, Ye wives, submit your selves
unto your own husbands, as it is convenient in the Lord.

Saint Peter also does instruct you very godly, thus saying, Let wives be
subject to their own husbands, so that if any obey not the word, they may
be won without the word, by the conversation of the wives, while they
behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. Whole apparel let it not
be outward, with broyded hair, and trimming about with gold, either in
putting on of gorgeous apparel: but let the hid man which is in the heart, be
without all corruption, so that the spirit be mild and quiet, which is a
precious thing in the sight of God. For after this manner in the old time did
the holy women, which trusted in God, apparel themselves, being subject to
their own husbands: as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord, whose daughters
ye are made doing well, and not being dismayed with any fear.

The new married persons, the same day of their marriage, must receive the holy
Communion.

The order for the visitation of the sick.
The Priest entering into the sick persons house, shall say.

Peace be in this house, and to all that dwell in it.

When he comes into the sick man's presence, he shall say kneeling down.

REmember not Lord our iniquities, nor the iniquities of our forefathers.
Spare us good Lord, spare thy people whom thou have redeemed with thy most
precious blood, and be not angry with us for ever.

Lord have mercy upon us.

Christ have mercy upon us.

Lord have mercy upon us.

Our Father which art in heaven, etc.

And lead us not into temptation.

Answer. But deliver us from evil. Ameu.

Minister. O Lord save thy servant.

Answer. Which puts his trust in thee.

Minister. Send him help from thy holy place.

Answer. And evermore mightily defend him.

Minister. Let the enemy have none advantage of him.

Answer. Nor the wicked approach to hurt him.

Minister. Be unto him, O Lord, a strong tower.

Answer. From the face of his enemy.

Minister. O Lord hear our prayers.

Answer. And let our cry come unto thee.

Minister. O Lord look down from heaven, behold, visit and relieve this thy
servant. Look upon him with the eyes of thy mercy, give him comfort and sure
confidence in thee, defend him from the danger of the enemy, and keep him in
perpetual peace and safety, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Hear us Almighty and most merciful God and Savior, extend thy accustomed
goodness to this thy servant, which is grieved with sickness: visit him, O
Lord, as thou did visit Peter's wives mother, and the Captains servant.
So visit and restore to this sick pecson his former health, if it be thy
will, or else give him grace so to take thy visitation, that after this paineful
life ended, he may dwell with thee in life everlasting.

Then shall the Minister exhort the sick person after this form, or other
like.

Dearly beloved, know this, that Almighty God is the Lord of life and death,
and over all things to them perteyning, as youth, strength, health, age,
weakness, and sickness. Wherefore, whatsoever your sikenesse is, know you
certainly that it is Gods visitation. And for what cause so ever this
sickness is sent unto you, whether it be to try your patience for the example
of other, and that your faith may be found in the day of the Lord, laudable,
glorious, and honorable, to the increase of glory and endless felicity, or
else it be sent unto you to correct and amend in you whatsoever does offend the
eyes of your heavenly Father: know you certainly, that if you truly repent you
of your sins, and bear your sickness patiently, trusting in Gods mercy, for
his dear Son Jesus Christ's sake, and render unto him humble thanks for his
fatherly visitation, submitting your self wholly unto his will, it shall turn
to your profit, and help you foward in the right way thatleadeth unto life
everlasting.

If the person visited be very sick, then the Curate may end his ex hortation
in this place.

Take therefore in good worth the chastisement of the Lord. For whom the
Lord loves, he chastises: yea, as Saint Paul says, he scourges every
son which he receives. If ye endure thastisement, he offreth himself unto
you, as unto his own children. What son is he that the father chastises
not? If ye be not under correction, where of all true children children are
partakers, then are ye bastards, and not children. Therefore seeing that when
our carnal fathers do correct us, we reverently obey them: shall we not now
much rather be obedient to our spiritual Father, and so live? And they for a
few days do chastise us after their own pleasure: but he does chastise us
for our profit, to the intent he may make us partakers of his holiness. These
words (good brother) are Gods words, and written in holy Scripture for our
comfort and instruction, that we should patiently and with thanksgiving bear
our heavenly Fathers correction, whenever by any manner of adversity it shall
please his gracious goodness to visit us. And there should be no greater
comfort to Christian persons, then to be made like unto Christ, by suffering
patiently adversities, troubles, and sickenesses. For he himself went not up
to joy, but first he suffered pain, he entered not into his glory, before he
was crucified. So truly our way to eternal joy is, to suffer here with
Christ, and our door to enter into eternal life is, gladly to die with
Christ, that we may rise again from death, and dwell with him in everlasting
life. Now therefore taking your sickness, which is thus profitable for you,
patiently, I exhort you in the name of God, to remember the profession which
you made unto God in your baptism. And forasmuch as after this life, there is
a count to be given unto the righteous Judge, of whom all must be judged
without respect of persons: I require you to examine your self, and your
state, both toward God and man, so that accusing and condemning your self for
your own faults, you may find mercy at our heavenly Fathers hand for Christ's
sake, and not to be accused and condemned in that fearful judgment.
Therefore I shall shortly rehearse the Articles of our faith, that you may know
whether you do believe as a Christian man should, or no.

Here the Minister shall rehearse the Articles of the faith, saying thus.

Do thou believe in God the Father almighty, etc.

As it is in Baptism.

Then shall the Minister examine whether he be in charity with all the world,
exhorting him to forgive from the bottom of his heart all persons that have
offended him, and if he have offended other, to ask them forgiveness: and
where he has done injury or wrong to any man, that he make amends to the
uttermost of his power. And if he have not before disposed his goods, let him
then make his will, and also declare his debts, what he owes, and what is
owing unto him, for discharging of his conscience, and quietness of his
Executors. But men must be often admonished that they set an order for their
temporal goods and lands, when they be in health.

These words before rehearsed, may be said before the Minister begin his
prayer, as he shall see cause.

The Minister may not forget nor omit to move the sick person (and that most
earnestly) to liberality toward the poor.

Here shall the sick person make a special confession, if he feel his
conscience troubled with any weighty matter. After which confession, the
Priest shall absolve him after this sort.

OUr Lord Jesus Christ, who has left power to his Church to absolve all
sinners which truly repent and believe in him, of his great mercy forgive
thee thine offenses: and by his authority committed to me, I absolve thee
from all thy sins, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
holy Ghost. Amen.

And then the Priest shall say the Collect following.

Let us pray.

Then shall the Priest say this Psalm.

IN thee, O Lord, have I put my trust, let me never be put to confusion: but
rid me, and deliver me in thy righteousness, In ce Domine speraui. Psalm. 71.
incline thiue ear unto me, and save me.


Be thou my strong hold, whereunto I may always resort: thou have promised to
help me, for thou art my house of defense, and my castle.

Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly: out of the hand of the
unrighteous and cruel man.

For thou, O Lord God, art the thing that I long for: thou art my hope, even
from my youth.

Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was borne: thou art he that
took me out of my mothers womb, my praise shall always be of thee.

I am become as it were a monster unto many: but my sure trust is in thee.

O let my mouth be filled with thy praise: that I may sing of thy glory, and
honor all the day long.

Cast me not away in the time of age: forsake me not when my strength fails
me.

For mine enemies speak against me, and they that lay wait for my soul, take
their counsel together, saying: God has forsaken him, persecute him, and take
him, for there is none to deliver him.

Go not far from me, O God: my God, haste thee to help me..

Let them be confounded and perish, that are against my soul: let them be
covered with shame and dishonor, that seek to do me evil.

As for me, I will patiently abide always: and will praise thee more and more.

My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation: for I know no
end thereof.

I will go forth to the strength of the Lord God: and will make mention of thy
righteousness only.

Thou, O God, have taught me from my youth up until now: therefore will I
tell of thy wondrous works.

Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray headed: until I have
showed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to all them that are
yet for to come.

Thy righteousness, O God, is very high: and great things are they that thou
have done, O God, who is like unto thee?

O what great troubles and adversities have thou showed me, and yet did
thou turn and refresh me: yea, and broughtest me from the deep of the earth
again.

Thou have brought me to great honor: and comforted me on every side.

Therefore will I praise thee and thy faithfulness (O God) playing upon an
instrument of music: unto thee will I sing upon the Harp, O thou holy one of
Israel.

My lppes will be feign when I sing unto thee: and so will my soul whom thou
have delivered.

My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are
confounded and brought unto shame that seek to do me evil.

Glory he to the Father, etc.

As it was in the beginning, etc.

Adding this.

Then shall the Minister say.

THe Almighty Lord, which is a most strong tower to al them that put their
trust in him, to whom all things in heaven, in earth, and under the earth do
bow and obey, be now and evermore thy defense, and make thee know and feel,
that there is none other name under heaven given to man, in whom, and through
whom thou may receive health and salvation, but only the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ, Amen.

The Communion of the sick.
FOrasmuch as all mortal men be subject to many sudden perils, Diseases, and
sicknesses, and ever uncertain, what time they shall depart out of this life,
therefore to the intent they may be always in a readiness to die whenever
it shall please Almighty God to call them, the Curates shall diligently from
time to time, but specially in the plague time exhort their Parishioners, to
the often receiving (in the Church) of the holy Communion of the body and blood
of our Savior Christ: which if they do, they shall have no cause in their
sudden visitation to be unquiet for lack of the same. But if the sick person
be not able to come to the Church, and yet is desirous to receive the Communion
in his house, then he must give knowledge over night, or else early in the
morning, to the Curate, signifying also how many be appointed to communicate
with him: And having a convenient place in the sick man's house, where the
Curate may reverently minster, and a good number to receive the Communion with
the sick person, with all things necessary for the same, he shall there
minister the holy Communion.

The Collect.
Almighty everliving God, maker of mankind, which do corect those whom
thou do love, and chastisest every one whom thou do receive: we beseech
thee to have mercy upon this thy servant, visited with thine hand, and to
grant that he may take his sickness patiently, and recover his bodily
health (if it be thy gracious will) and whenever his soul shall depart from
the body, it may be without spot presented unto thee. through Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.

The Epistle.
MY son, Heb. 12.
despise not the correction of the Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked of
him. for whom the Lord loves, him he corrects: Yea, and he scourges every
son whom he receives.

The Gospel.
Verily, verily I say unto you, He that hears my word, John. 5.
and believes on him that sent me; has everlasting life, and shall not come
unto damnation, but he passes from death unto life.

At the time of the distribution of the holy Sacrament, the Priest shall first
receive the Communion himself, and after minister unto them that be appointed
to communicate with the sick.

But if a man either by reason of extremity of sickness, or for want of
warning in due time to the Curate, or for lack of company to receive with
him, or by any other just impediment, do not receive the Sacrament of Christ's
body and blood: then the Curate shall instruct him, that if hce do truly
repent him of his sins, and steadfastly believe that Jesus Christ has
suffered death upon the Cross for him, and shed his blood for his redemption,
earnestly remembering the benefits he has thereby, and giving him hearty
thanks therefore, he does eat and drink the body and blood of our Savior
Chrift profitably to his souls health, although he do not receive the
Sacrament with his mouth.

When the sick person is visited, and receives the holy Communion all at one
time, then the Priest for more expedition, shall cut off the form of the
visitation at the Psalm, In thee, O Lord, have I put my trust, and go
straight to the Communion.

In the time of Plague, Sweat, or such other like contagious times of
sicknesses, or diseases, when none of the Parish or neighbors can be gotten to
communicate with the sick in their houses, for fear of the infection, upon
special request of the diseased, the Minister may alonely communicate with
him.

The order for the burial of the dead.
The Priest meeting the corpse at the Church style, shall say, or else the
Priest and Clerks shall sing, and so go either into the Church, or toward
the grave.

I Am the resurrection and the life (faith the Lord.) He that belieueth in me,
John 11.
yea though he were dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever lives, and
believes in me, shall not die for ever.

I know that my redeemer lives, and that I shall rise out of the earth in the
last day, and shall be covered again with my skin, Job. 19.
and shall see God in my flesh: yea, and I my self shall behold him, not with
other, but with these same eyes.

We brought nothing into this world, 1. Tim. 6. Job. 1.
, neither may we carry any thing out of this world. The Lord gives, and the
Lord takes away. Even as it pleases the Lord, so comes things to pass:
Blessed be the Name of the Lord.

When they come to the grave, while the corpse is made ready to be laid into
the earth, the Priest shall say, or the Priest and Clerks shall sing.

MAn that is borne of a woman has but a short time to live, Job. 14.
and is full of meserie. He comes by, and is cut down like a flower, he
flees as it were a shadow, and never continues in one stay. In the midst of
life, we be in death: of whom may we seek for succor but of thee, O Lord,
which for our sins justly art displeased? Yet, O Lord God most holy, O Lord
most mighty, O holy and most merciful Savior, deliver us not into the bitter
pains of eternal deatth. Thou know Lord the secrets of our hearts, shut
not up thy merciful eyes to our prayers: but spare us Lord most holy, O God
most mighty, O holy and merciful Savior, thou most worthy judge eternal,
suffer us not at our last hour for any pains of death to fall from thee.

Then while the earth shall be cast upon the body by some standing by, the
Priest shall say.

FOrasmuch as it has pleased almighty God of his great mercy, to take unto
himself the soul of our dear brother here departed, we therefore commit his
body to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and
certain hope of resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ,
who shall change our vile body, that it may be like unto his glorious body,
according to the mighty working, whereby he is able to subdue all things to
himself.

Then shall be said or sung.

I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, write, From henceforth blessed
are the dead which die in the Lord. Even so says the spirit, that they rest
from their labors.

Then shall follow this Lesson, taken out of the xv. Chapter to the
Corinthians, the first Epistle.

CHrist is risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that
sleep. For by a man came death, and by a man came the resurrection of the
dead. For as by Adam all die, even so by Christ shall all be made alive, but
every man in his own order. The first is Christ, then they that are Christ's
at his coming. Then comes the end, when he has delivered up the kingdom
to God the Father, when he has put down all rule, and all authority and
power. For he must reign till he have put al his enemies under his feet. The
last enemy that shall be destroyed, is death. For he has put all things
under his feet. But when he says, All things are put under him: it is
manifest that he is excepted that has put all things under him. When all
things are subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject
unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. Else what
do they which are baptized over the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are
they then baptized over them? yea, and why stand we always then in ieopardie? By
our rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. That I have
fought with beasts at Ephesus after the manner of men, what aduantageth it me,
if the dead rise not again? Let us eat, and drink, for tomorow we shall
die. Be not ye deceived, evil words corrupt good manners. Awake truly out of
sleep, and sin not. For some have not the knowledge of God, I speak this to
your shame. But some man will say, How arise the dead? With what body shall
they come? Thou fool, that which thou sowest, is not quickened except it die.
And what sowest thou? Thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare corn,
as of wheat or some other: but God gives it a body at his pleasure, to every
seed his own body. All flesh is not one manner of flesh: but there is one manner
of flesh of men, another manner of flesh of beasts, another of fishes, another
of birds. There are also celestial bodies, and there are bodies terrestrial.
But the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is
another. There is one manner glory of the Sun, and another glory of the
Moon, and another glory of the Stars. For one Star differs from another
in glory. So is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it
rises again in incorruption. It is sown in dishonor, it rises again in
honor. It is sown in weakness, it rises again in power. It is sown a
natural body, it rises again a spiritual body. There is a natural body,
and there is a spiritual body: As it is also written, The first man Adam was
made a living soul, and the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. Howbeit,
that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and then
that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthie. The second
man is the Lord from heaven, heavenly. As is the earthie, such are they that be
earthy. And as is the heavenly, such are they that are heavenly. And as we
have borne the image of the earthie, so shall we bear the image of the
heavenly. This say I brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
kingdom of God, neither does corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I show
you a mystery, we shall not all sleep: but we shall all be changed, and that in
a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, by the last trumpe. For the trumpe shall
blow, and the dead shall rife incorruptible, and we shall be changed: For this
corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
When this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on
immortality, then shall be brougt to pass the saying that is written: Death
is swallowed up into victory: Death, where is thy sting? Hell, where is thy
victory? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.
But thanks be unto God, which has given us victory through our Lord Jesus
Christ. Therefore my dear brethren, be ye steadfast and immovable, always
rich in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know how that your labor is
not in vain in the Lord.

The Lesson ended, the priest shall say.

Lord have mercy upon us.

Christ have mercy upon us.

Lord have mercy upon us.

Our Father which art in heaven, etc.

And lead us not into temptation.

Answer. But deliver us from evil. Amen.

The Priest. Almighty God, with whom do live the spirits of them that depart
hence in the Lord, and in whom the souls of them that be elected, after they
be delivered from the burden of the flesh, be in joy and felicity: we give
thee hearty thanks, for that it has pleased thee to deliver this N. our
brother out of the miseris of this sinful world, beseeching thee, that it may
please thee of thy gracious goodness, shortly to accomplish the number of
thine elect, and to hasten thy kingdom, that we with this our brother, and all
other departed in the true faith of thy holy Name, may have our perfect
consummation and bliss, both in body and soul, in thy eternal and
everlasting glory. Amen.

The Collect.
O Merciful God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the resurrection
and the life, in whom whosoever believes, shall live, though he die, and
whosoever lives and believes in him, shall not die eternally, who also taught
us (by his holy Apostle Paul) not to be sorry as men without hope, for them
that sleep in him: we meekely beseech thee (O Father) to raise us from the
death of sin, unto the life of righteousness, that when we shall depart this
life, we may rest in him, as our hope is this our brother does, and that at
the general resurrection in the last day, we may be found acceptable in thy
sight, and receive that blessing which thy well-beloved son shall then pronouce
to all that love and fear thee, saying, Come ye blessed children of my
Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.
Grant this, we beseech thee, O merciful Father, through Jesus Christ our
Mediator and Redeemer. Amen.

The thanksgiving of women after childbirth, commonly called the Churching of
women.
The woman shall come into the Church, and there shall kneel down in some
convenient place, nigh unto the place where the Table stands, and the Priest
standing by her, shall say these words, or such like, as the case shall require.

FOrasmuch as it has pleased Almighty God of his goodness to give you safe
deliverance, and has preserved you in the great danger of childebirth: ye
shall therefore give hearty thanks unto God, and pray

Then shall the Priest say this Psalm

I Have lifted up mine eyes unto the hills: from whence comes my help. Psalm.
121.


My help comes even from the Lord: which has made heaven and earth.

He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: and he that keeps thee, will
not sleep.

Behold, he yt keeps Israel: shall neither slumber nor sleep.

The Lord himself is thy keeper: the Lord is thy defense upon thy right hand.

So that the Sun shall not burn thee by day: nor the Moon by night.

The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: yea, it is even he that shall
keep thy soul.

The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in: from this time
forth for evermore.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, etc.

As it was in the beginning, is now, etc.

Lord have mercy upon us.

Christ have mercy upon us.

Lord have mercy upon us.

Our Father which art in heaven, etc.

And lead us not into temptation.

Answer. But deliver us from evil.

Priest. O Lord save this woman thy servant.

Answer. Which puts her trust in thee.

Priest. Be thou to her a strong tower.

Answer. From the face of her enemy.

Priest. Lord hear our prayer.

Answer. And let our cry come unto thee.

Priest. Let us pray.

The woman that comes to give her thanks, must offer accustomed offerings:
and if there be a Communion, it is convenient that she receive the holy
Communion.

A Commination against sinners, With certain prayers to be used diverse times
in the year.
After Morning prayer, the people being called together by the ringing of a
bell, and assembled in the Church, the English L^^^ie shall be said, after the
accustomed manner: which ended, the Priest shall go into the pulpit, and say
thus.

BRethren, in the primitue Church there was a godly discipline, that at the
beginning of Lent, such persons as were notorious sinners, were put to open
penance, and punished in this world, that their souls might be saved in the
day, of the Lord: and that other admonished by their example, might be the
more afraid to offend.

In the stead whereof, until the said discipline may be restored again, (which
thing is much to be wished) it is thought good, that at this time (in your
presence) should be read the general sentences of Gods cursing against
impenitent sinners, gathered out of the xxvii. Chapter of Deuteronomie, and
othen places of Scripture: and that ye should answer to every sentence, Amen:
to the intent that you, being admonished of the great indignation of God
against sinners, may thy rather be called to earnest and true repentance, and
may walk more warily in these dangerous days, fleeing from such vices, for
the which ye affirm with your own mouths, the curse of God to be due.

Cursed is the man that makes any carved or molten image, an abomination to
the Lord, the work of the hands of the craftesman, and puts it in a secret
place to worshipst.

And the people shall answer and say.

Amen.

Minister. Cursed is he that curses his father and mother.

Answer. Amen.

Minister. Cursed is he that remoueth away the mark of his neighbors land.

Answer. Amen.

Minister. Cursed is he that makes the blind to go out of his way.

Answer. Amen.

Minister. Cursed is he that lets in indgement the right of the stranger,
of them that be fatherless, and of widows.

Answer. Amen.

Minister. Cursed is he that smites his neighbor serretly.

Answer. Amen.

Minister. Cursed is he that lies with his neighbors wife.

Answer. Amen.

Minister. Cursed is he that takes reward to slay the soul of innocent blood.

Answer. Amen.

Minister. Cursed is he that puts his trust in man, and takes man for his
defense, and in his heart goes from the Lord.

Answer. Amen.

Minister. Cursed are the unmerciful, the fornicatours and adulterers, and the
covetous persons, the worshippers of images, slanderers, drunkards, and
extortioners.

Answer. Amen.

Minister. NOw seeing that all they be accursed (as the Prophet David bears
witness) which do err and go astray from the commandments of God, Psalm.
119.
let us (remembering the dreadful judgment hanging over our heads, and being
always at hand) return unto our Lord God, with all contrition and meekness of
heart, bewayling and lamenting our sinful life, knowleding and confessing our
offenses, and seeking to bring forth worthy fruits of penance. For now is
the Axe put unto the root of the trees, Matt. 3.
so that every tree that brings not forth good fruit, is he wen down, and
cast into the fire. Heb. 11
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God: he shall
power down rain upon the sinners, snares, fire, and brimstone, storm and
tempest, Psalm. 10.
this shall be their portion to drink. For lo, the Lord is commen out of his
place, Esai. 26
to visit the wickedness of sueh as dwell upon the earth. Mala. 3.
But who may abide the day of his coming? Who shall be able to endure when he
appears? His fan is in his hand, Matt. 3.
and he will purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the barn, but he
will burn the chafe with unquenchable fire. The day of the Lord comes as a
thief in the night: and when men shall say, Peace, and all things are safe,
then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as sorrow comes upon a woman
traueiling with child, and they shall not escape. Then shall appear the wrath
of God in the day of vengeance, Romans 2.
which obsrinate sinners, through the stubbernnesse of their heart, have heaped
unto themselves, which despised the goodness, patience, and long sufferance of
God, when he called them continually to repentance. Then shall they call upon
me (says the Lord) but I will not hear, Prou. 1.
they shall seeken me early, but they shall not find me, and that because
they hated knowledge, and received not the fear of the Lord, but abhorred my
counsel, and despised my correction. Then shall it be too late to knock,
When the door shall be shut, and too late to cry for mercy, When it is the
time of justice. O terrible voice of most just judgment, which shall be
pronounced upon them. Matt. 25.
when it shall be said unto them, Go ye cursed into the fire everlasting,
Which is prepared for the Devil and his angels. 2 cor. 6.
Therefore brethren, take we heed betime, while the day of salvation lasts,
for the night comes, when none can Work: John 9.
but let us while we have the light, believe in the light, and Walker as the
children of the light, that We be not cast into the utter darkness, Matt. 25.
Where is Weeping and gnashing of teeth. Let us not abuse the goodness of God,
Which calls us mertifully to amendment, and of the endless pity promises
us forgiveness of thatt Which is past, if (with a Whole mind and true heart)
Wereturne unto him. Esai.i.
For though our sins be as red as searlet, they sall be as White as snow:
and though they be like purple, yet shall they be as White as wool. Eze. 28.
Turn you clean (says the Lord) from all your wickedesse, and your snne
shall not be your destruction. Cast a way from yon al your ungodliness that ye
have done, make you new hearts, and a new spirit. Wherefore will ye die, O ye
honse of Is;rael, seeing that I have no pleasure in the death of him that
dies, says the Lord God: turn you then, and ye shall live. i. Iohnz.
Athough we have ssinned, yet have we an advocate with the father, Jesus Christ
the righteous, and he it is that ovteineth grace for our sins. For he was
wounded for our offenses, Esai. 53.
and smitten for our wickedness. Let us therefore return unto him, who is ye
merciful receiver of all true penitent snners, afsuring our selves that he is
ready to receive us, and most willing to pardon us, if we come unto him wiht
faithful repentance, if we will submit our selves unto him, and from
henceforth walk in his ways, Matt. 11.
if we will take take his easy yoke and light burden upon us, to follow him
in lowlines, patience and charity, and be ordered by the governance of his
holy spirit, seeking always his glory, and serving him duly in our vocation,
with thanksgiving. This if we do, Christ will deliver us from the curse of
the law, and from the extreme maledirtion Which shall light upon them that
shall be set on ye left hand, and he will set us on his right hand, Mar. 25.
and give us the blessed benediction of his father, commanding us to take
possession of his glorious kingdom, unto the which he vouchsafe to bring us
all, for his infinite mercy.

Then shall they all kneel upon their knees: and the Priest and Clerks
kneeling (where they are accustomed to say the Letanie) shall say this Psalm,
Miserere mei Deus.

Have mercy upon me, Misere mei. Psalm 51
O God, after thy great goodness: according to the multitude of thy mercies
do away mine offenses.

Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness: and cleanse me from my smne.

For I knowledge my faults: and my sin is ever before me.

Against thee only have I finned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou
might be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged.

Behold, I was sapen in wickedness: and in sin has my mother conceived me.

But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shall make me to
understand wise dome secretly.

Thou shall purge me with Hysope, and I shall be clean: thou shall wash me,
and I shall be whiter then snow.

Thou shall make me hear of joy and gladness: that the bones Which thou have
broken may rejoice.

Turn thy face from my smnes: and put out all my misdeedes.

Make me a clean heart, O God: and renew a right spirit Within me.

Cast me not away from thy presence: and take not thy holy spirit from me.

O give me the confort of thy help again: and stablish me with thy free
spirit.

Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked: and sinners shall be converted
unto thee.

Deliver me from bloodgiltinesse, O God, thou that are the God of my health:
and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.

Thou shall open my lips (O Lord:) my mouth shall show thy praise.

For thou desire no sacrifice, else would I give it thee: but thou delightest
not in burnt offering.

The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a broken and contrite heart (O God)
shall thou not despise.

O be favorable and gracious unto Sion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.

Then shall thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the
burnt offerings and oblations: then shall they offer young bullock upon thine
altar.

Glory be to the Father, etc.

As it was in the beginning, etc.

Lord have mercy upon us.

Christ have mercy upon us.

Lord have mercy upon us.

Our Father which art in heaven, etc.

And lead us not into temptation.

Answer. But deliver us from evil. Amen.

Minister. O Lord save thy servants.

Answer. Which put their trust in thee.

Minister. Send unto them help from above.

Answer. And evermore mightily defend them.

Minister. Help us O God our Savior.

Answer. And for the glory of thy names sake deliur us, be merciful unto us
sinners for thy names sake.

Minister. O Lord hear our prayer.

Answer. And let our cry come unto thee.

Let us pray.

O Lord we beseech thee mercifully hear our prayers, and spare all those
which confess their sins to thee, that they (whose cosciences by sin are
accused) by thy merciful pardon may be absolved through Christ our Lord. Amen.

O Most mighty God and merciful Father, Which have compassion of all men, and
hate nothing that thou have made, Which would not the death of a sinner,
but that he should rather turn from sin, and be saved: mercifully forgive
us our trespasses, receiuc and comfort us, Which be grieved and wearied with
the burden of our sin. Thy property is to have mercy, to thee only it
appertains to forgive snnes. Spare us there fore good Lord, spare thy people
whom thou have redeemed: enter not into judgment with thy servants, which be
vile earth, and miserable sinners: but so turn thine ire from us, Which
meekely knowledge our vileness, and truly repent us of our faults: so make
haste to help us in this world, that we may ever live with thee in the world
to come, through Jesus Chrift our Lord, Amen.

Then shall the people say this that follows, after the Minister.

Turn thou us, O good Lord, and so shall we be turned: be favorable, O Lord,
be favorable to thy people, which turn to thee in weeping, fasting, and
praying: for thou art a merciful God, full of compassion, long suffering, and
of great pity.

Thou sparest when we deserve punishment, and in thy wrath think upon
mercy. spare thy people good Lord, spare them, and let not thine heritage be
brought to confusion. Hear us, O Lord, for thy mercy is great, and after the
multitude of the mercies look upon us.

Cum priuilegio.



Month. The j. day.
The Psalms of David.
Beatus vir qui non abijt. Psalm.j.
BLessed is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly,
Morning prayer
nor stand in the way of sinners: and has not sit in the seat of the
scornful.

But his delight is in the law of the Lord: and in his law will he exercise
himself day and night.

And he shall be like a tree planted by the water side: that will bring toorth
his fruit in due season.

His lease also shall not wither: and look whatsoever he does, it shall
prosper.

As for the ungodly it is not so with them: but they are like the chafe which
the winmde scatters away from the face of earth.

Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment: neither
the sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

But the Lord knows the way of the righteous: and the way of the ungodly
shall perish.

Quare fremuerunt gentes? Psalm. ij.
Why do the heathen so furiously rage together: and why do the people imagine
vain thing:

The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together:
against the Lord, and against his anointed.

Let us break their bonds asuuder: and cast away their tordes from us.

He that dwells in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: the Lord shall have
them in derision.

Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath: and vex them in his fore
displeasure.

Yet have I set my king: upon my holy hill of Sion.

I will preach the law where of the Lord has said unto me: thou art my
son, this day have I begotten thee.

Desire of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance: and
the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.

Thou shall bruise them with a rod of iron: and break them in pieces like a
potters vessel.

Be wise now therefore, Dye kings: be learned ye that are judges of the earth.

Serve the Lord in fear: and rejoice unto him with reverence.

Kiss the Some lest he be angry, and so ye penrish from the right way: if his
wrath be kindled (yea but a little) blessed are all they that put their trust
in him.

Domine quid? Psalm.iij.
LOrd how are they increased that trouble me: many are they that rise against
me.

Many one there be that say of my soul: there is no help for him in his God.

But thou, O Lord, art my defender: thou art my worship, and the lifter up of
my head.

I did call upon the Lord with my voice: and he heard me out of his holy hill.

I laid me down and slept, and rose up agaie: for the Lord sustained me.

I will not be afraid for ten thousands of people: that have set themselves
against me round about.

Up Lord, and help me, O my God: for thou smitest all mine enemies upon the
cheek bone, thou have broken the teeth of the ungodly.

Salvation belongs unto the Lord: and the blessing is upon the people.

Cum inuocarem, Psalm.iiij.
Hear me When I call, O God of my righteousness: for thou have set me at
liberty When I was in trouble, have mercy upon me, and heacken unto my prayer.

O ye sons of men, how long Will ye blaspheme mine honor: and have such
pleasure in vanity, and seek after leasing:

Know this also, that the Lord has thosen to himself the man that is godly:
When I call upon the Lord, he will hear me.

Stand mawe and sin not: commune with your own heart, and in your chamber,
and be still.

Offer the sacrifice righteousness: and put your trust in the Lord.

There be many that say: who will show us any good:

Lord list thou up: the light of thy countenance upon us.

Thou have put gladenesse in my heart: since the time that their corn and wine
and oil increased.

I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest: for it is thou Lord only
that make me dwell in safety.

Verba mea auribus. Psalm.5.
POnder my Words, O Lord: consider my meditation.

O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my king and my God: for unto thee
will I make my prayer.

My voice shall thou hear betimes, O Lord: early in the morning will I direct
my prayer unto thee, and will look up.

For thou art the God that have no pleasure in wickedness: neither shall any
evil dwell with thee.

Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight: for thou hate all them that
work vanity.

Thou shall destroy them that speak leasing: the Lord will abhorxe both the
blood thirsty and deceitful man.

But as for me, I will come into thy house, even upon the multitude of thy
mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy Temple.

Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousinesse, because of mine enemies: make thy
way plame before my face.

For there is no faithfulness in his mouth: their inward parts are very
wickedness.

Their throat is an open sepulcher: they flatter with their tongue.

Destroy thou them, O God, let them perish through their own imaginations:
cast them out in the multitude of their vngodlinesese, for they have rebelled
against thee.

And let all them that put their trust in thee, rejoice: they shall ever be
giving of thanks, because thou defendest them, they that love thy Name shall
be Joyful in thee.

For thou Lord wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous: and with thy
favorable kindness will thou defend him, as with a shield.

Domine ne in furore. Psalm. vj.
O Lord rebuke me not in thine indignation: Evening prayer
neither chasten me in thy displeasure.

Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord heal me, for my bones are
vexcd.

My soul is also fore troubled: but Lord how long will thou punish me:

Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver my soul: Oh save me for thy mercies sake.

For in death no man remembers thee: and who will give thee thanks in the pit:

I am weary of my groaning, every night Wash I my ved: and water my couch with
my tears.

My beauty is gone for very trouble: and worn away because of all mine
enemies.

Away from me all ye that work vanity: for the Lord has heard the voice of
my weeping.

The Lord has heard my petition: the Lord will receive my prayer.

All mine enemies shall be confonnded and sore vexed: they shall be turned
back and put to shame suddenly.

Domine Deus meus. Psalm. vij.
O Lord my God, in thee have I put my trust: save me from all them that
petsecute me, and deliver: me.

Least he devour my soulce like a lion, and tear it in pieces: While there is
none to help.

O Lord my God, if I have done any such thing: or if there be any wickedness
in my hands.

If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me: yea, I have
delivered him that Without any cause is mine enemy.

Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me: yea, let him tread my
life down upon the earth, and lay mine honor in the dust.

Stand up, O Lord, in thy wrath, and lift up thy self: because of the
indignation of mine enemies, arise up for me in the judgment that thou have
commanded.

And so shall the congregation of the people come about thee: for their sakes
therefore lift up thy self again.

The Lord shall judge the people, give sentence with me, O Lord: according to
my righteousuesse, and according to the innocence that is in me.

O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end: but guide thou the just.

For the righteous God: tries the very hearts and reins.

My help comes of God: which preseructh them that are true of heart.

God is a righteous judge, strong and patient: and God is provoked cuery day.

If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword: he has bent his bow, and
made it ready.

He has prepared for him the instruments of death: he ordeineth his arrows
against the persecuters.

Behold, he trauaileth with inischiefe: he has conceived sorrow, and brought
forth ungodliness.

He has graven and dug up a pit: and is fallen himself into the
destruction that he made for other.

For his travail shall come upon his own head: and his wickedness shall fall
on his own pate.

I will give thanks unto the Lord, according to his righteousness: and will
praise the name of the Lord the most high.

Domine Dominus. Psalm. viij.
O Lord our governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world: thou that
have set thy glory above ye heavens.

Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings have thou ordained strength,
because of thine enemies: that thou might still the enemy and the auenger.

For thou will consider the heavens, even the works of thy fingers: the Moon
and the Stars which thou have ordained.

What is man that thou art mindful of him: and the son of man that thou
visitest him:

Thou made him lower then the Angels: to crown him with glory and workship.

Thou make him to have dominion of the works of thy hands: and thou have
put all things in subjection under his feet.

All sheep and oxen: yea and the beasts of the field.

The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea: and whatsoever walks
through the paths of the seas.

O Lord our governor: how excellent is thy Name in all the world:

Confitebor tibi, Psalm. ix.
I Will give thanks unto thee, Morning Prayer
O Lord, with my whole heart: I will speak of all thy marucellous works.

I will be glad and rejoice in thee: yea, my songs will I make of thy Name, O
thou most Highest.

While mine enemies are driven back: they shall fall and perish at thy
presence.

For thou have maintained my right, and my cause: thou art set in the throne
that iudgest right.

Thou have rebuked the Heathen, and destroyed the ungodly: thou have put out
their Name for ever and ever.

O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: even as the cities
which thou have destroyed, their memorial is perished with them.

But the Lord shall endure for ever: he has also prepared his seat for
judgment.

For he shall judge the World in righteousness: and minister true judgment
unto the people.

The Lord also will be a defense for the oppressed: even a refuge in due time
of trouble.

And they that know thy name, will put their trust in thee: for thou Lord have
never failed them that seek thee.

O praise the Lord which dwells in Sion: show the people of his doings.

For when he makes inquisition for blood, he remembers them: and forgets
not the complaint of the poor.

Have mercy upon me, O Lord, consider the trouble which I suffer of them that
hate me: thou that liftest nice up from the gates of death.

That I may show all thy praises within the ports of the daughter of Sion: I
will rejoice in thy salvation.

The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the same net which
they hid privily, is their foot taken.

The Lord is known to execute judgment: the ungodly is trapped in the work
of his own hands.

The wicked shall be turned into hell: and all the people that forget God.

For the poor shall not always be forgotten: the patient abiding of the meek
shall not perish for ever.

Up Lord, and let not man have the upper hand: let the Heathen be judged in
thy fight.

Put them in fear, (O Lord:) that the heathen may know themselves to be but
men.

Vt quid Domine? Psalm. x.
Why stand thou so far off (O Lord:) and hidest it thy face in the
needful time of trouble?

The ungodly for his own lust does persecute the poor: let them be taken in
the crafty Wiliness that they have imagined.

For the ungodly has made boast of his own hearts desire: and speaks good
of the covetous whom GOD abhorxeth.

The ungodly is so proud, that he cares not for God: neither is God in all
his thoughts.

His ways are always grievous: thy judgments are far above out of his fight,
and therefore defieth he all his enemies.

For he has said in his heart, Tush, I shall ncuer be caft down: there
shall no harm happen unto me.

His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud: under his tongue is
ungodliness and vanity.

He sits lurking in the theeuish corners of the streets: and privily in his
lurking dens does he murder the innocent, his eyes are set against the
poor.

For he lies waiting secretly, even as a Lion lurketh he in his den: that he
may ravish the poor.

He does ravish the poor: when he gets him into his net.

He falls down and humbles himself: that the Congregation of the poor
may fall into the hands of his Captains.

He has said in his heart, Tush, God has forgotten: he hides away his face,
and he will never see it.

Arise (O Lord God) and lift up thine hand: forget not the poor.

Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God: while he does say his heart,
Tutsh, thou God rarest not for it?

Surely thou have seen it: for thou beholdest ungodliness and wrong.

That thou may take the matter into thine hand: the poor conmitteth
himself unto thee, for thou art the helper of the friendlesse.

Break tthou the power of the ungodly and malicious: take away his
ungodliness, and thou shall find none.

The Lord is King for ever and ever: and the heathen are perised out of the
land.

Lord, thou have heard the desire of the poor: thou preparest their heart, and
thine ear hearkeneth thereto.

To help the fatherless and poor unto their right: that the man of the earth
be no more exalted against them.

In domino confido. Psalm. xj
IN the Lord put I my trust: how say ye then to my soul, that the should flee
as a bird unto the hill?

For lo, the ungodly bend their vow, and make ready their arrows within the
quwer: that they may primly shoot at them which are true of heart.

For the foundations will be cast down: and what has the righteous done.

The Lord is in his holy Temple: the Lords seat is in heaven.

His eyes consider the poor: and his eye lids tries the children of men.

The Lord allows the righteous: but the ungodly, and him that delights in
wickedness, does his soul abhor^c.

Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and vrimssone, storm, and
tempest: this shall be their portion to drink.

For the righteous Lord loves righteousness: his countenance will behold the
thing that is just.

Saluum me fac. Psalm. xij.
Help me Lord, Eucoing prayer
for there is not one godly man left: for the faithful are minished from among
the children of men.

They talk of vanity every one with his neighbor: they do but flatter with
their lips, and dissemble with their double heart.

The Lord shall root out all deceitful lips: and the tongue that speaks
proud things.

Which have said, with our tongue we will prevail: we are they that ought to
speak, who is Lord over us?

Now for the comfortless troubles sake of the needy: and because of the deep
sighing of the poor.

I will up (says the Lord:) and will help every one from him that swells
against him, and will set them at rest.

The words of the Lord are pure words: even as the silver which from the earth
is tried, and purified seven times in ye fire.

Thou shall keep them, O Lord: thou shall preserve him from this generation
for ever.

The ungodly walk on every side: when they are exalted, the children of men
are put to rebuke.

Vsquequo Domine. Psalm. xiij.
HOw long will thou forget me (O Lord) for ever: how long will thou hide thy
face from me?

How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in mine heart:
how long shall mine enemies triumph over me?

Consider and hear me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, that I sleep not
in death.

Left mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: for if I be cast down,
they that trouble me, will rejoice at it.

But my trust is in thy mercy: and my heart is joyful in thy salvation.

I will sing of the Lord, because he has dealt so lovingly with me: yea, I will
praise the name of the Lord most highest.

Dixit insipiens. Psalm. xiiij.
THe fool has said in his heart: there is no God.

They are corxupt and become abominable in their doings: there is not one that
does good, (no not one.)

The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there
were any that would understand and seek after God.

But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is none that does good, no not one.

Their throat is an open sepulcher, with their tongues have they deceived: the
poison of aspes is under their lips.

Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: their feet are swift to shed
blood.

Destruction and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of peace have they
not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes.

Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief: eating up
my people as it were bread?

And call not upon the Lord, there were they brought in great fear (even
where no fear was:) for God is in the generation of the righteous.

As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor: because he
puts his trust in the Lord.

Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion: when the Lord turns the
captivity of his people, then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

Domine quis habitabit? Psalm. xv.
LOrd who shall dwell in thy tabernacle: Morning prayer
or who shall rest upon thy holy hill?

Even he that leads an vncorrupt life: and both the thing which is right, and
speaks the tructh from his heart.

He that has used no deceit in his tongue, nor done enill to his neighbor:
nor has not slandered his neighbors.

He that sets not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes: and makes
much of them that fear the Lord.

He that swears unto his neighbor, and disappointeth him not: though it
Were to his own hinderance.

He that has not given his money upon usury: nor taken reward against the
innocent.

Who so does thrse things: shall never fall.

Conserua me. Psalm. xvj.
Preserve me, O God: for in thee have I put my trust.

O my soul, thou have said unto the Lord: thou art my God, my goods are
nothing unto thee.

All my delight is upon the saints that are in the earth: and upon such as
excel in virtue.

But they that run after another god: shall have great trouble.

Their drink offerings of blood will I not offer: neither make mention of
their names within my lips. The Lord himself is the portion of mine
inheritance, and of my cup: thou shall maintain my lot.

My lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground: yea, I have a goodly heritage.

I will thank the Lord for giving me warning: my reins also chasten me in the
night season.

I have set God always before me: for he is on my right hand, therefore I
shall not fall.

Wherefore my heart was glad, and my glory rejoiced: my flesh also shall rest
in hope.

For Why: thou shall not leave my soul in hell: neither shall thou suffer
thine Holy one to see corruption.

Thou shall she we me the path of life, in thy presence is the fullness of joy:
and at thy right hand there is pleasure for evermore.

Exaudi Domine iustitiam. Psalm.xvij.
Hear the right, O Lord, consider my complaint: and hearken unto my prayer,
that goes not out of feigned lips.

Let my sentence come forth from thy presence: and let thine eyes look upon
the thing that is equal.

Thou have prooded and visited mine heart in the night feason, thou have tried
me, and shall find no wickedness in me: for I am utterly purposed that my
mouth shall not offend.

Because of men's works that are done against the words of my lips: I have
kept me from the ways of the destroyer.

O hold thou up my goings in thy paths: that my footesteps slip not.

I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shall hear me: incline thine ear
to me, and hearken unto my words.

Show thy marvelous loving kindness, thou that art the Savior of them which
put their trust in thee: from such as resist thy right hand.

Keep me as the apple of an eye: hide me under the shadow of thy wings.

From the ungodly that trouble me: mine enemies compass me round about, to
take away my foul.

They are enclosed in their own fat: and their mouth speaks proud things.

They lie waiting in our way on cuery side: turning their eyes down to the
ground.

Like as a Lion that is greedy of his pray: and as it were a lions whelpe
lurking in secret places.

Up Lord, disappoint him, and cast him down: dcliuer my soul from the
ungodly, which is a sword of thine.

From the men of thy hand, O Lord, from the men, I say, and from the evil
world: which have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with
thy hid treasure.

They have children at their desire: and leave the rest of their substance for
their babes.

But as for me, I will behold thy presence in righteousness: and when I awake up
after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied with it.

Diligam re. Psalm. xviij.
I will love thee (O LORD) my strength, Evening prayer
the Lord is my stony rock and my defense: my Savior, my God, and my might,
in whom I will trust, my buckler, the horn also of my salutation, and my
refuge.

I will call upon the Lord, which is worthy to be praised: so shall I be safe
from mine enemies.

The sorrows of death compassed me: and the ouerflowings of ungodliness made me
afratd.

The pains of hell came about me: the snares of death ouertooke me.

In my trouble I will call upon the Lord: and comylaine unto my God.

So shall he hear my voice out of his holy Temple: and my complaint shall
come before him, it shall enter eueu into his ears.

The earth trembled and quaked: the very foundations also of the hills shook
and were removed, because he was wroth.

There went a smoke out of his presence: and a consuming fire out of his mouth,
so that coals were kindled at it.

He bowed the heavens also and came down: and it was dark under his feet.

He rode upon the Cherubims and did fly: he came flying upon the wings of the
wind.

He made darkness his secret place: his Pauilion round about him, with dark
water and thick clouds to cover him.

At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed: hailestones and
coals of fire.

The Lord also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his thunder:
hailestones and coals of fire.

He sent out his arrows, and scattered them: he cast forth lightnings, and
destroyed them.

The springs of waters were seen, and the foundations of the round world were
discovered at thy chiding, O Lord: at the blasting of the breath of thy
displeasure.

He shall send down from the high to fetch me: and shall take me out of many
waters.

He shall deliver me from my strongest enemy, and from them which hate me:
for they are too mighty for me.

They prevented me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was my vpholder.

He brought me forth also into a place of liberty: he brought me forth, even
because he had a favor unto me.

The Lord shall reward me after my righteous dealing: according to the
cleanness of my hands shall he recompense me.

Because I have kept the ways of the Lord: and have not forsaken my God as the
wicked does.

For I have an eye unto all his laws: and will not cast out his commandments
from me.

I was also vncorrupt before him: and eschewed mine own wickedness.

Therefore shall the Lord reward me after my righteous dealing: and according
unto the cleanness of my hands in his eye sight.

With the holy, thou shall be holy: and with a perfect man, thou shall be
perfect.

With the clean, thou shall be clean: and with the froward, thou shall
learn frowardness.

For thou shall save the people that are in adversity: and shall bring down
the high looks of the proud.

Thou also shall light my candle: the Lord my God shall make my darkness to
be light.

For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men: and with the help of my God I
shall leap over the wall.

The way of God is an undefiled way: the word of the Lord also is tried in
the fire, he is the defender of all them that put their trust in him.

For who is God but the Lord? or who has any strength except our God?

It is God that girdeth me with strength of war: and makes my way perfect.

He makes my feet like Hearts feet: and sets me upon high.

He teaches my hands to fight: and mine arms shall break even a bow of
steel.

Thou have given me the defense of thy salvation: thy right hand also shall
hold me up, and thy loving correction shall make me great.

Thou shall make room enough under me for to go: that my foot steps shall
not slide.

I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them: neither will I turn
again till I have destroyed them.

I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand: but fall under my
feet.

Thou have girded me with strength unto the battle: thou shall throw down
mine enemies under me.

Thou have made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me: and I shall
destroy them that hate me.

They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them: yea even unto the Lord
shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.

I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: I will cast them out
as the clay in the streets.

Thou shall deliver me from the struings of the people: and thou shall make me
the head of the heathen.

A people whom I have not known: shall serve me.

As Soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: but the strange children
shall dissemble with me.

The strange children shall fail: and be afraid out of their prisons.

The Lord lives, and blessed be my strong helper: and praised be the God of
my salvation.

Even the God that sees that I be avenged: and subdueth the people unto me.

It is he that delivers me from my (cruel) enemies, and sets me up
above mine adversaries: thou shall rid me from the wicked man.

For this cause will I give thanks unto thee (O Lord) among the Gentiles: and
sing praises unto thy Name.

Great prosperity gives he unto his King: and shows loving kindness unto
David his anointed, and unto his seed for evermore.

Coeli enarrant. Psalm.xix.
THe heavens declare the glory of God: Morning Prayer
and the firmament shows his handy work.

Oue day tells another: and one night certifieth another.

There is neither speech nor language: but their voices are heard among them.

Their sound is gone out into all lands: and their words into the ends of
the world.

In them has he set a tabernacle for the sun: which comes forth as a
bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoices as a Giant to run his course.

It goes forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runs about unto
the end of it again: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.

The Law of the Lord is an undefiled Law, converting the soul: the testimony
of the Lord is sure, and gives wisdom unto the simple.

The statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart: the commandment of
the Lord is pure, and gives light unto the eyes.

The fear of the Lord is clean, and endures for ever: the judgments of the
Lord are true, and righteous altogether.

More to be desired are they then gold, yea, then much fine gold: sweeter also
then honey and the honey comb.

Moreover, by them is thy servant taught: and in keeping of them there is great
reward.

Who can tell how often he offends: O cleanse thou me from my secret faults.

Keep thy servant also from presumptutous sins, lest they get the dominion
over me: so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the great offense.

Let the words of my mouth, and the mediitation of my heart: be always
acceptable in thy sight.

O Lord: my strength, and my redeemer.

Exaudiat te Deus. Psalm. xx.
The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble: the name of the God of Jacob defend
thee.

Send thee help from the Sanctuary: and strength thee out of Sion.

Remember all thy offerings: and accept thy burnt sacrifice.

Grant thee thy hearts desire: and fulfill all thy mind.

We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the name of the Lord our
God: the Lord perform all thy petitions.

Now know I that the Lord helps his anointed, and will hear him from his
holy heaven: even with the wholesome strength of his right hand.

Some put their trust in charets, and some in horses: but we will remember the
name of the Lord our God.

They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.

Save Lord, and hear us, O King of heaven: when we call upon thee.

Domine in virtute. Psalm.xxj.
The king shall rejoice in thy strength, O Lord: exceeding glad shall he be
of thy salvation.

Thou have given him his hearts desire: and have not denied him the request of
his lips.

For thou shall prevent him with the blessings of goodness: and shall set a
crown of pure gold upon his head.

He asked life of thee, and thou gave him a long life: even for ever and ever.

His honor in great is thy salvation: glory and great worship shall thou lay
upon him.

For thou shall give him everlasting felicity: and make him glad with the joy
of thy countenance.

And why? because the King puts his trust in the Lord: and in the mercy of
the most highest he shall not miscarie.

All thine enemies shall feel thine hand: thy right hand shall find out them
that hate thee.

Thou shall make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath: the Lord shall
destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall consume them.

Their friute shall thou root out of the earth: and their seed from among the
children of men.

For they intended mischief against thee: and imagined such a device as they
are not able to perform.

Therefore shall thou put them to flight: and the strings of thy bow shall thou
make ready against the face of them.

Be thou exalted Lord in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy
power.

Deus, Deus meus. Psalm.xxij.
MY God, Evening Prayer
my God, (look upon me) why have thou forsaken me: and art so far from my
health, and from the words of my complaint?

O my God, I cty in the day time, but thou hear not: and in the night season
also I take no rest.

And thou continuest holy: O thou worship of Israel.

Our fathers hoped in thee: they trusted in thee, and thou did deliver them.

They called upon thee, and were helped: they put their trust in thee, and were
not confounded.

But as for me, I am a worm, and no man: a very scorn of men, and the
outceast of the people.

All they that see me, laugh me to scorn: they shoot out their lips, and
shake their head, saying.

He trusted in God, that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, if he will
have him.

But thou art he that took me out of my mothers womb: thou wast my hope when
I hanged yet upon my mothers breasts.

I have been left unto thee ever since I was borne: thou art my God, even from
my mothers womb.

O go not fro me, for trouble is hard at hand: and there is none to help me.

Many oxen are come about me: fat Bulls of Basan close me in on every side.

They gape upon me with their mouths: as it were a ramping and roaring Lion.

I am powered out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart also
in the midst of my body is even like melting wax.

My strength is dried up like a potstheard: and my tongue cleaves to my
gummes: and thou shall bring me into the dust of death.

For (many) dogs are come about me: and the counsel of the wicked lays siege
against me.

They pearsed my hands, and my feet, I may tell all my bones: they stand
staring and looking upon me.

They part my garments among them: and cast lots upon my vesture.

But be thou not far fromme, O Lord: thou art my surtour, have thee to the
help me.

Deliver my soul from the sword: my darling from the power of the dog.

Save me from the Lions mouth: thou have heard me also from among the horns
of the unicorns.

I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation
will I praise thee.

O praise the Lord ye that fear him: magnify him allye of the seed of
Jacob, and fear him all ye seed of Israel.

For he has not despised nor abhored the low estate of the poor, he has not
hid his face from him: but when he called unto him, he heard him.

My praise is of thee in the great congregation: my vows will I perform in
the sight of them that fear him.

The poor shall eat and be satisfied: they that seekee after the Lord, shall
praise him, your heart shall live for ever.

All the euds of the world shall remember themselves, and be turned unto the
Lord: and all the kinreds of the nations shall worship before him.

For the kingdom is the Lords: and he is the governor among the people.

All such as be fat upon earth: have eaten and worshipped.

All they that go down into the dust shall kneel before hin: and no man has
quickened his own soul.

My seed shall serve him: they shall be counted unto the Lord for a
generation.

They shall come, and the heavens shall declare his righteousness: unto a people
that shall be borne, whom the Lord has made.

Dominus regit me. Psalm. xxiij
The Lord is my shepherd: therefore can I lack nothing.

He shall feed me in a grcene pasture: and lead me forth besides the waters
of comfort.

He shall convert my soul: and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness
for his names sake.

Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
evil: for thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff comfort me.

Thou shall prepare a table before me against them that trouble me: thou have
anointed my head with oil, and my cup shall be full.

But thy loving kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life:
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

Domini est terra. Psalm. xxiiij
THe earth is the Lords, Morning prayer.
and all that therein is: the compass of the world, and they that dwell therein.

For he has founded it upon the seas: and prepared it upon the floods.

Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord: or who shall rife up in his holy
place?

Even he that has cleave hands, and a pure heart: and that has not list up
his mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his neighbor.

He shall receinere the blessing from the Lord: and rightcousnesse from the God
of his salvation.

This is the generation of them that seek him: cucn of them that seek thy
face, O Jacob.

Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and he ye lift up ye everlasting doors: and
the King of glory shall come ill.

Who is the king of glore: it is the Lord strong and mighty, even the Lord
mighty in battle.

Lift up yonr heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors: and
the king of glory shall come in.

Who is the king of glory: even the Lord of hosts, he is the king of glory.

Ad te Domine. Psalm xxv.
Unto thee, O Lord, will I lift up my soul, my God, I have put my trust in
thee: O let me not be confounded, neither let mine enemies triumph over me.

For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed: but with as transgress
without a cause, shall be put to confusion.

Show me thy ways, O Lord: and tearh me thy paths.

Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: for thou art the God of my
salvation, in thee has been my hope al ye day long.

Call to remembrance, O Lord, thy tender meries: and thy loving Kindness
which has been ever of old.

Oh remember not the sins and offenses of my youth: but according to thy
mercy think thou upon me, O Lord, for thy goodness.

Gracious and righteous is the Lord: therefore will be teach sinners in the way.

Them that be meek shall he guide in judgment: and such as be gentle, them
shall he learn his way.

All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth: unto such as keep his
covenant and his testimonies.

For thy Names sake, O Lord: be merciful unto my sin, for it is great.

What man is he that fears the Lord: him shall he teach in the may that he
shall choose.

His soul shall dwell at ease: and his seed shall inherit the land.

The secrct of the Lord is among them that fear him: and he will show them his
covenant.

Mine eyes are ever looking unto the Lord: for he shall pluck my feet out
of the net.

Lurne thee unto me, and have mercy upon me: for I am dcsolate and in misery.

The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my troubles.

Look upon mine adversity and misery: and forgive me all my sin.

Cousider mine enemies how many they are: and they bear atyrannous hate
against me.

O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be contounded, For I have put my
trust in thee.

Let perfectness and righteous dealing wait upon me: for my hope has been
in thee.

Deliver Israel, O God: out of all his troubles.

Iudica me Domine. Psalm. xxvj
BE thou my judge, O Lord, for I have walked innocently. my trust has been
also in ye Lord, therefore shall I not fall.

Eramine me, O Lord, and prove me: try out me reinef and my heart.

For thy loving kindness is ever before mine eyes: and I will walk in thy
truth.

I have not dlwelt with vain persons: neither will I have fellowship with the
deceitful.

I have hated the congregation of the wicked: and will not sit among the ungodly.

I will wash my hands in innocence, O Lord: and so will I go to thine altar.

That I may show the voice of thanksgiving: and tell of all thy wondrous
works.

Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house: and the place where thine
honor dwells.

O shut not up my soul with the sinners: nor my life with the bloodthirstie.

In whose hands is wickedness: and their right hands are full of gifts.

But as for me, I will walk innocently: O Lord delitter me and be merciful
unto me.

My foot stands right: I will praise the Lord in the congregations.

Dominus illuminatio. Psalm.xxvij.
THe Lord is my light and my salvation, Eueing prayer.
whom then shall I fear: the Lord is the strength of my life, of whom then
shall I be afrand?

When the wicked (even mine cnemies and my foes) came upon me to cate up my
flesh: they stumbled and fell.

Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart be
afraid: and though there rose up war against me, yet will I put my trust in
him.

One thing have I destred of the Lord, which I will require: even that I may
dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the fair
beauty of the Lord, and to visit his temple.

For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle: yea, in the
serret place of his dwelling shall be hide me, and set me up upon a rock of
stone.

And now shall he lift up mine head: above mine enemies round about me.

Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation with great gladness: I will
sing and speak praises unto the Lord.

Hearken unto my voice, O Lord, when Icrie unto thee: have mercy upon me, and
hear me.

My heart has talked of thee, seek ye my face: thy face Lord will I seek.

O hide not thou thy face from me: nor cast thy servant away in displeasure.

Thou have been my succor: lcaue me not, neither forsake me, O God of my
salvation.

When my father and my mother forsake me: the Lord takes me up.

Teach me thy way, O Lord: and lead me in the right way, bccause of mine
enemies.

Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: for there are false
witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak wrong.

I should btterly have fainted: but that I believe verily to sce the goodness of
the lord in the land of the liung.

O tarry thou the Lords leisure: be strong, and he shall comfort thine heart,
and put thou thy trust in the Loard.

Ad te Domine, Psalm. xxviij
Unto thee will I cry, O Lord, my strength: think no scorn of me, left if
thou make as though thou hear not, I bccome like them that go down into
the pit

Hear the voice of my humble petitions when I cry unto thee: when I hold up
my hauds toward the mercy seat of thy holy Temple.

O pluck me not away (neither destroy me) with the ungodly and wicked doers:
which speak friendly to their neighbors, but imagine mischief in their
hearts.

Reward them according to their deeds: and according to the wickedness of
their own inventions.

Recompense them after the workem of their hands: pay them that they have
deserved.

For they regard not in their mind the works of the Lord, nor the operation of
his hands:therefore shall he break them down, and not build them up.

Praised be the Lord:for he has the voice of my humble petitions.

The Lord is my strength and my shield, my heart has trusted in him, and I am
helped:therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my song will I praise him.

The Lord is my strength: and he is the wholesome defense of his anointed.

O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance:feed them,
and set them up for ever.

Afferte Domino Psalm. xxix.
BRing unto the Lord (O ye mighty) bring young rams unto the Lord:ascribe
unto the Lord worship and strength.

Give the Lord the honor due unto his Name:worship the Lord with holy worship.

It is the Lord that commands the waters:it is the glorious God that makes
the thunder.

It is the Lord that rules the sea, the voice of the Lordeis mighty in
operation:the voice of the Lord is a glorious voice.

The voice of the Lord breaks the Cedac trees: yea, the Lord breaks the
Cedars Libanus.

He made them also to skippe like a calfe:Libanus also and Syrion like a young
Unicorn.

The voice of the Lord divides the flames of fire, the voice of the Lord
shakes the wilderness: yea, the Lord shakes the wilderness of Cades.

The voice of the Lord makes the hindes to bring forth young, and discovers
the thirke vushes:in his temple does iuery man speak of his honor.

The Lord sits above the water flood:and the Lord remains a King for ever.

The Lord shall give strength unto his people:the Lord shall give his people
the blessing of peace.

Exaltabo te Domine. Psalm.xxx.
I waill magnify thee, Morning prayer.
O Lord, for thou have set me up: and not made my foes to triumph over me.

O Lord my God, I cried unto thee: and thou have healed me.

Thou Lord have brought my soul out of hell:thou have kept my life from them
that go down to the pit.

Sing praises unto the Lord (O ye faints of his:) and give thanks to him for a
remembrance of his holiness.

For his wrath endures but the twinckliong of an eye, and in his pleasure is
life: heaviness may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.

And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be removed: thou Lod of thy
goodness had made my hill so strong.

Thou did turn thy fare (fro me:) and I mas troubled.

Then cried I unto thee, O Lord: and gate me unto my Lord right humbly.

What profit is thee in my blood: when I go down to ye pit:

Shall the dust give thanks unto thee: or shall it declare thy truth

Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord be thou my helper.

Thou have turned ny heaviness into joy: thou have put off my sackecloth, and
girded me with gladness.

Therefore sball every good man sing of thy praise without reasing: O my god, I
will give thanks unto thee for ever.

In te domine speraui. Psalm. xxxj.
IN thee, O Lord, have I put my trust: let me never be put to confusiou,
deliver me in thy righteousness.

Bow down thine ear to me: make haste to deliver me. And be thou my strong
rock, and the house of defense: that thou may save me.

For thou art my strong rock and my castle: be thou also my game, and lead
me for thy Names sake.

Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my
strength.

Into thy hands I commend my spitrit: for thou have redeemed me, O Lord, thou
God of truth.

I have hated them that hold of superstitious vanities: and my trust has been
in the Lord.

I will be glad, and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou have considered my
trouble, and have known my soul in adversities.

Thou have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: but have set my feet in
a large room.

Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble: and mine eye is consumed for
very heaviness, yea, my soul and my body.

For my soul is waxen old with heaviness: and my years with mourning.

My strength fails me, because of mine iniquity: and my bones are consumed.

I became a reproof among all mine enemies, but speciaily among my neighbors:
and they of mine acquaintance were afraid of me, and they that did see me
without conveyed themselves from me.

I am clean forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am become like a broken
vessel.

For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude: and fear is on every side,
while they conspire together against me, and take their counsel to take away
my life.

But my hope has been in thee, O Lord: I have said, Thou art my God.

My time is in thy hand, deliver me from the hand of mine enemies: and from
them that persecute me.

Show thy servant the light of thy countenance: and save me for thy mercies
sake.

Let me not be confounded, O Lord, for I have called upon thee: let the ungodly
be put to tonfusion, and be put to silence in the grave.

Let the lying lips be put to silence: which cruelly, disdainfully, and
despightfully speak against the righteous.

O how plentiful is thy goodness which thou have laid up for them that fear
thee: and that thou have prepared for them that put their trust in thee, even
before the sons of men!

Thou shall hide them priuly by thine own presence, from the provoking of al
men: thou shall keep them secretly in thy tabernacle from the strife of
tongues.

Thanks be to the Lord: for he has showed me marvelous great kindness in a
strong city.

And when I made haste, I said: I am cast out of the sight of thine eyes.

Nevertheless thou heardedest the voice of prayer: when I cried unto thee.

O love ye Lord all ye his saints: for ye Lord preserves them that are
faithful, and plenteously rewards the proud doer.

Be strong, and he shall stablish your heart: all ye that put your trust in
the Lord.

Beati quorum. Psalm.xxxij.
BLessed is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven: and whose sine is covered.
Evening prayer


Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputes no sin: and in whose spirit
there is no guile.

For while I held my tongue: my bones consumed away through my daily
complaining.

For thy hand is heavy upon me day and might: and my moisture is like the
drought in Summer.

I will knowledge my sin unto thee: and mine unrighteousness have I not hid.

I said, I will confess my sins unto the Lord: and so thou forgauest the
wickedness of my sin.

For this shall every one that is godly, make his prayer vntothee in a time
when thou may be found: but in the great matter floods they shall not come
nigh him.

Thou art a place to hide me in, thou shall preserve me from trouble: thou
shall compass me about with songs of deliverance.

I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shall go: and I
will guide thee with mine eye.

Be ye not like to horie and mule, which have no understanding: whole mouths
must be holden with bit and bridle, lest they fall upon thee.

Great plagues remain for the ungodly: but who so putleth his trust in ye
Lord, mercy imbraceth him on every side.

Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the Lord: and be idyfull all ye that
are true of heart.

Exultate iusti. Psalm.xxxiij.
REidice in the Lord, O ye righteous: for it becomes well the just to be
thankful.

Praise the Lord with harp: sing Psalms unto hin with the Lute and instrument
of ten strings.

Sing unto the Lord a new song: sing praises lustily (unto him) with a good
courage.

For the word of the Lord is true: and all his works are faithful.

He loves righteousness and judgment: The earth is full of the goodness of
the Lord.

By the word of the Lord were the heavens made: and all the hosts of them by
the dreath of his mouth.

He gathers the waters of the sea together, as it were upon an heap: and
lays up the deep as in a treasure house.

Let all the earth leare the Lord: stand in awe of him, all ye that dwell in
the world.

For he spoke, and it was done: he commanded, and it stood fast.

The Lord brings the counsel of the hearthen to naught: and makes the
deulses of the people to be of none effect, and casts out the counsels of
Peinces.

The counsel of the Lord shall endure for ever: and the though is of his
heart from generation to generation.

Blessed are the people whose God is the Lord Iehoua: and blessed are the folk
that he has chosen to him to be his inheritance.

The Lord looked down from heaven, and beheld all the children of men: from
the habitation of his dwelling he considers all them that dwell in the earth.

He fashioneth all the hearts of them: and understands all their works.

There is no king that can be saved by thy multitude of an host: neither is any
mighty man delivered by much strength.

A horse is counted but a vain thing to save a man: neither shall he deliver
any man by his great strength.

Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him: and upon them that
put their trust in his mercy.

Lo deliver their souls from desath: and to feed them in the time of death.

our sounle has patiently faried for Lord: for he is our help, and our shield.

For our heart shall rejoice in him: because we have hoped in his holy Name.

Let the merciful kindness (O Lord) be upon us: like as we do put our trust
in thee.

Benedicam Domino, Pslxxxiiij.
I will always give thanks unto the Lord: his praise shall ever be in my mounth.

My sonle shall make her boast of the Lord: the humble sall hear there of, and
be glad.

O praise the Lord with me: and let us magnify his Name together.

I sought the Lord, and he heard me: yea, he delivered me out of all my fear.

They had an eye unto him, and were lightend: and their faces were not ashamed.

Lo, the poor cries, and the Lord hears him: yea, and saves him out of
all his troubles.

The Angle of the Lord tarieth round about them that fear him: and delivers
them.

O taste and see how gracious the Lord is: blessed is the man that trusts in
him.

O fear the Lord ye that be his saints: for they that fear him, lack nothing.

The Lons do lack, and suffer hunger: but they which seek the Lord, shall
want no manner of thing that is good.

Come ye children, and hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.

what man is he that lusteh to live, and would feign see good days: keep thy
tongue from evil, and thy lips that they speak no guile.

Esche we evil and do good: seek peace, and ensue it.

The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous: and his ears are open upon unto
them prayers.

The countenance of the Lord is against them that do cuill: to root out the
remembrance of them from the earth.

The righteous cry, and the Lord heaeth them: and delivers them out of all
their troubles.

The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and will save such as
be of an humble spirit.

Great are the troubles of the rightcous: but the Lord delivers him out of
all.

He keeps all his bones: so that not one of them is broken.

But misfortune shall slay the ungodly: and they that hate the righteous,
shall be desolate.

The Lord delivers the souls of his servants: and all they that put their
trust in him, shall not be destitute.

Iudica Domine. Psalm.35.
P Lead thou my cause, Morning prayer.
O Lord, with them that strive with me: and fight thou against they that fight
against me.

Lay hand upon the shield and bucklcr: and sand up to help me.

Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say
unto my soul, I am thy salvation.

Let them be confonded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be
turned back, and brought to confusion, that imagine mischief for me.

Let them be as the dust before the wind: and the Angel of the Lord scattering
them.

Let their be as the dust before the wind: and the Angel of the Loard
scattering them.

Let their may be dark and slipperie: and let the Angle of the Lord persecute
them.

For they have privily laid their net to destroy me withhout a cause: yea, cuen
without a cause have they made a pit for my soul.

Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares, and his net that he has laid
privily catch himself: that he may fall into his own mischief.

And my soul, be joyful in the Loes: it shall rejoice in his salvation.

All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee, which deliuerest the
poor from him that is too strong for him: yea, the poor and him that is in
misery, from hun that spoileth him.

False witness did rise up: they laid to my charge thigs that I know not.

They rewarded me evil for good: to the great discomfort of my soul.

Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul
with fasting: and my prater shall turn into mine own bosom.

I behauted my self as though it had been my friend, or my brother: I went
heavily as one that mourns for his mother.

But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered them together: yea, the
very abiects came together against me unawares, making mowes at me, and ceased
not.

With the flatterers were busy mockers: which gnashed upon me with their teeth.

Lord, how long will thou look upon this: O deliver my soul from the
calamities which they bring on me, and my darling from the Lions.

So will I give thee thanks in the great Congregation: I will praise thee
among much people.

Olet not them that are mine enemies triumph over me ungodly: neither let them
wink with their eyes that hate me without a cause.

And why: their communing is not for peace: but they imagine deceitful words
against them that are quiet in the land.

They gaped on me with their mouths, and said: Fie on thee, fie on thee, we
saw it with our eyes.

This thou have seen, O Lord: hold not thy tongue then, go not far from me,
O Lord.

Awake and stand up to indge my quarrel: avenge thou my cause, my God and my
Lord.

Judge me, O Lord my God, according to thy righteousness: and let then not
triumph over me.

Let them not say in their hearts, There, there, so would we have it: neither
let them say, we have devoured him.

Let them be put to confusion and shame together that rejoice at my trouble:
let them be clothed with rebuke and dishonor that boast themselves against me.

Let them be glad and rejoice that favor my rightcous dealimng: yea, let them
say always, Blessed be the Lord, which has pleasure in the prosperity of his
servant.

And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy righteousness: and of thy
praise all the day long.

Dixit iniustus. Psalm. 36.
MY heart shows me the wigkednesse of the ungodly: that there is no fear of
God before his eyes.

For he flattereth himself in his own sight: until his abominable sin be
found out.

The words of his mouth are burighteous, and full of deceit: he has left off
to behave himself wisely, and to do good.

He imagines mischiese upon his bcd, and has set himself in no good way:
neither does he abhor any thing that is evil.

Thy mercy, O Lord, reaches unto the heaucns: and thy faithfulness unto the
clouds.

Thy righteousness stands like the strong mountains: thy indgements are
like the great deep.

Thou Lord shall save both man and beast, how excellent is thy mercy, O God:
and the children of men shall put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.

They sbalbe satisfied with the plenteousnesse of thy house: and thou shall
give them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the river.

For with thee is the well of life: and in thy light shall she fee light.

O continue forth thy loving kindness unto them that know thee: and thy
righteousness unto them that are true of heart.

O let not the foot of pride come against me: and let not the hand of the
ungodly cast me down.

There are they fallen (all) that work wickedness: they are cast down, and
shall not he able to stand.

Noli aemulari. Psalm. 37.
FRet not thy selse, Evening prayer.
because of the ungodly: neither be thou envious against the evil doers.

For they shall soon be cut down like the grass: and he withered even as
the green herb.

Put thou thy trust in the Lord, and be doing good: dwell in the land, and
berily thou shall he fed.

Delight thou in the Lord: and he shall give thee thy hearts defire.

Commit thy way unto the Lord, and put thy truft in him: and he shall bring it
to pass.

He shall make the righteousness as clear as the light: and the just dealing
as the noone day.

Hold thee still in the Lord, and abide patiently upon him: but grieve not thy
self at him whose may does prosper, against the man that does after evil
counsels.

Leave off from wrath, and let go disleasure: fret not thy self, else shall
thou be moved to do evil.

Wicked doers shall be rooted out: and they that patiently abide the Lord,
thofe shall inherit the land.

Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone: thou shall look after
his place, and he shall be away.

But the meek spirited shall possess the earth: and shall be refresed in the
multitude of peace.

The ungodly feeketh connsaile against the lust: and gnasheth upon him with his
teeth.

The Lord shall laugh him to scorn: for he has seen that his day is comnnng.

The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow: to cast down
the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of a right conversation.

Their sword shall go though their own heart: and their bow shall be broken.

A final thing that the righteous has: is better then great riches of the
ungodly.

For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken: and the Lord vpholdeth the
righteous.

The Lord knows the days of the godly: and their inheritance shall endure
for ever.

They shall not be confounded in the perilous time: and in the days of dearth
they shall have enough.

As the ungodly they shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall confume as
the fat of lambs: yea, even, as the smoke shall they confume away.

The ungodly horoweth, and pays not again: but the righteous is mercrifull
and liberal.

Such as be bleffed of God, shall possess the land: and they that be curfed of
him shall be rooted out.

The lord orders a good man's going: and makes his way acceptable to himself.

Though he fall, he shall not be cast away: for the Lord vpholderth him with his
hand.

I have been young, and now am old: and yet saw I never the righteous
forsaken, nor his feed begging their bread.

The righteous is ever merciful, and lends: and his seed is blessed.

Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good: and dwell foreuermore.

For the Lord loves the thing that is right: he forsakes not his that be
godly, but they are preserved for ever.

The righteous shall be punished: as for the seed of the ungodly, it shall be
rooted out.

The righteous shall inherit the land: and dwell therein for ever.

The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom: and his tongue will be
talking of judgment.

The law of his God is in his heart: and his goings shall not slide.

The ungodly feeth the righteous: and feekeeth occasion to slay him.

The Lord will not leave him in his hand: nor condemn him when he is judged.

Hope thou in the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall promote thee, that thou
shall possess the land: when the ungodly shall perish, thou shall see it.

I my self have seen the ungodly in great power: and flourishing like a green
Bay tree.

And I went by, and lo he was gone: I sought him, but his place could no where
be found.

Keep innocence, and take heed unto the thiug that is right: for that shall
bring a man peace at the laft.

As for the trausgressours, they shall perish togrther: and the end of the
ungodly is, They shall be rooted out at the last.

But the salvation of the righteous comes of the Lord: which is also their
strength in the time of trouble.

And the Lord shall stand by them, and save them: he shall deliver them from
the vugodly, and shall save them, because they put their trust in him.

Domine ne in furore. Psalm. 38.
PVt me not to rebuke (O Lord) in thine anger: neither chasten me in thine
anger: neither tahsten chasten me in thine heavy displeasure. Morning prayer.


For thine arrows stick fast in me: and thy hand presses me fore.

There is no heaith in my flesh, because of thy displeasure: neither is there
any rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.

For my wickednesses are gone over my head: and are like a fore burden too
heavy for me to bear.

My wounds stink, and are corrupt: through my foolishnes.

I am brought into so great trouble and nuserie: that I go mourning all the day
long.

for my loins are filled with a fore disease: and there is no whole part in my
body.

I am feeble and fore smitten: I have roared for the very difquietnesse of my
heart.

Lord, thou know all my desire: and my groaning is not hid from thee.

My heart pants, my strength has failed me: and the sight of mine eyes is
gone from me.

My lovers and my neighbors did stand looking upon my trouble: and my kinsmen
stood a far off.

They also that sought after my life, laid snares for me: and they that went
about to do me evil, talked of wickedones, and imagined deceit all the day
long.

As for me, I was like a deaf man, and heard: not: and as one that is dumb,
which does not open his mouth.

I became even as a man that hears not: and in whole mouth are no reprooses.

For in thee, O Lord, have I put my trust: thou shall answer for me, O Lord my
God.

I have required that they (even mine enemies)sold not triumph over me: for
when my foot sltpt, they rejoiced greatly against me.

And I truly am set in the plague; and my heaviness is ever in my sight.

For I will confess my wickedness: and be forie for my sin.

But mine enemies live, and are mighty: and they that hate me wrongfully, are
many in number.

They also that reward evil for good, are against me: because I follow the
thing that good is.

Forsake me not, O Lord my God: be not thou far from me. Haste thee to help
me: O Lord God my faluation.

Dixi, Custodiam. Psalm.39.
I Said, I will take heed to ways: that I offend not in my tongue.

I will keep my mouth (as it were with a bridle:) wihile the ungodly is in my
sight.

I held my tongue, and spoke nothing: I Kept silence, yea, even from good
words, but it was pain and grief to me.

My heart was hot within me, and while I was thus musing, the fire kindled;
and at the last I spase with my tongue.

Lord let me know mine end, and the number of my days; that I may be certified
how long I have to live.

Behold, thou have made my days as it were a span long: and mine age is even
as nothing in respect of thee, and verily every man living is altogetder
vanity.

For man walks in a vain shadow, and disquietetli him self in baine: he
heapeth up ciches, and can not tell who shall gather them.

And now Lord what is my hope: truly my hope is even in thee.

Deliver me from all mine offenses: and make me not arebuke unto the foolish.

I became dumb, and opened not my mouth: for it was thy doing.

Take thy plague away from me: I am even confumed by the means of thy heavy
hand.

When thou with rebukes doett thasten man for sin, thou make his beauty to
consume away like as it were a moth fretting a garment: every man therefore is
but vanity.

Hear my prayer, O Lord, and with thine ears consider my calling: hold not
thy peace at my tears.

For I am a stranger with thee, and a soiouner: as all my fatders were.

O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength: before I go hence, and be
no more seen.

Expectans expectaui. Psalm. 40.
I Waited patiently for the Lord: and he inclined unto me, and heard my
calling.

He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the m^re and clay: and fet
my feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.

And he has put a new song in month: even a thanks gining unto our God.

Many shall see it, and feate: and shall put their trust in the Lord.

Blessed is the man that has set his hope in the Lord: and turned not unto the
proud, and to such as go about with lies.

O Lord my God, great are thy wondrous works which thou have done: like as be
also thy thoughts which are to usward, and yet there is no man that ordercth
them unto thee.

If I would declare them and speaue of them: they should be more then I am able
to express.

Saeisice and meat offering thou would have: but mine ears have thou opened.

Burnt offerings and sacrisice for sin have thou not required: then said I,
Lo, I come.

In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should fulfill thy
will, O my God: I am consent to do it, yea, thy law is within my heart.

I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I will not
refrain my lips, O Lord, and that thou know.

I have not hid thy righteousncsse within my heart: my talking has been of
thy truth, and of thy salvation.

I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth: from the great congregation.

Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O LORD: let thy loving kindness and
thy truth away preserve me.

For innumerable troubles are come about me, my sins have taken such hold
upon me, that I am not able to look up: yea, they are mo in number then the
hairs of mine head, and mine heart has failed me.

O Lord, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me: make haste (O Lord) to help me.

Let them be a shamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to
destroy it: let them be driven backward and put to rebuke that with me evil.

Let them be desolate and rewarded with shame, that say unto me: Fie upon thee,
fie upon thee.

Let all those that seek thee, be joyful, and glad in thee: and let sucd as
love thy salvation, say always, the Lord be praised.

As for me, I am poor and nee die: but the Lord cares for me.

Thou art my helper and redeemer: make no long tarying, O my God.

Beatus qui intelligit. Psalm. 41.
BLessed is he that confidereth the poor and needy: the Lord shall deliver
him in the time of trouble. Evening prayer.


The Lord preserve him and keep him alive, that he may be blessed upon earth:
and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.

The Lord comfort him when he lies sick upon his bed: make thou all his bed
in his sickness.

I said, Lord be merciful unto me: heal my soul, for I have sinned against
thee.

Mine enemies speak evil of me: when shall he die, and his name perish?

And if he come to see me he speaks vanity: and his heart ronceineth falsehood
within himself, and when he comes forth, he tells it.

All mine enemies whisper together against me: even against me do they
imagine this evil.

Let the sentence of guiltiness proceed against him: and now that he lies,
let him rise up no more.

Yea, even mine own familiar friend whom I trusted: which did also eat of my
bread, has laid great wait for me.

But be thou merciful unto me, O Lord: raise thou me up again, and I shall
reward them.

By this I know thou fauourest me: that mine enemy does not triunpy against
me.

And when I am in my health, thou vpholdest me: and shall set me before thy
face for ever.

Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: world without eude. Amen.

Quemadmodum. Psalm. 42.
LIke as the Heart desires the water brooks: so longs my soul after thee, O
God.

My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for hte living God: when shall I come
to appear before the presence of God?

My tears have been my meat day and might: while they daily say unto nie,
Where is now the God?

Now when I think thereupon, I power out my heart by my self: for I went with
the multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God.

In the voice of praise and thanksgiving: among such as keep holy day.

Why art thou so full of heaviness (O my soul:) and why art thou so
disquieted within me?

Put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks for the help of his
countenance.

My God, my soul is vexed within me: therefore will I remember thee,
concerning the land of Iordane, and the little hill of Hermon.

One deep calls another, because of the noise of the water pipes: all thy
waves and storms are gone over me.

The Lord has granted his I sing of him, and made my prayer unto the God of
my life.

I will say unto the God of my strength, why have thou forgotten me: why go I
thus heavily, while the enemy oppresses me?

My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword: while mine enemies (that
tropuble me) cast me in the teeth.

Namely while they say daily unto me: where is now thy God?

Why art thou so vexed, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?

O put thy trust in GOD: for I will yet thank him, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.

Iudica me Deus. Psalm.43.
Give sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause againfr the vongodly
people: O deliver me from the deceitful and whiched man.

For thou art the God of my strength, why have thou put me from thee: and why
go I fo heavily, while the eneme oppresses me?

Oh send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me: and bring me
unto thy holy hill, and to thy dwelling.

And that I may go unto the Altar of God, even unto the God of my joy and
gladness: and upon the harp will I give thanks unto thee, O God my God.

why art thou so heavy, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?

O put thy truft in God: for I will yet give him thanks, which is the help of
my countenance, and my God.

Deus auribus. Psalm.44.
We have heard with our cares, Morning prayer.
O God, our fathers have told us: what thou have done in their time of old.

How thou have driven out the Hearthen with thy hand, and planted them in: how
thou have destroyed the nations, and rast them out.

For they gate not the land in possession though their own sword: neither was
it their own arm that helped them.

But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy conntenance: because
thou haddesta favor unto them.

Thou art my King (O God:) send help unto Jacob.

Through thee will we overthrow our enemmies: and in thy Name will we tread
them rise up against us.

For I will not trust in my bow: it is not my sword that shall help me.

But it thou that sasest us from our enemies and put them to consusion that
hate us.

We make our boast of God all day long: and will praise thy Name for ever.

But now thou art far off, and put us to coufusion: and go not forth
with our armies.

Thou make us to turn our backs upon one enemies: so that they which hate
us, spoil our goods.

Thou let us to be eaten up like sheep: and have scattered us among the
heathen.

Thou sellest thy people for naught: and take no money for them.

Thou make us to be rebuked of our neighbors: to be laughed to scorn, and
had in derision of them that are round about us.

Thou make us to be a by word among the heathen: and that the people shake
their heads at us.

My confusion is daily before me: and the shmme of my face has covered me.

For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer: for the eneime and auenger.

And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget thee: nor behave
our selves frowadly in thy covenant.

Our Heart is not turued back: neither our steps gone out of thy way.

No not when thou have smitten us into the place of Dragons: and covered us
with the shadow of death.

If we have forgotten the name of our God, and holden up ore hands to any
srange god: shall not God search it ont? for he knows the very secrets of the
heart.

For thy sake also are we killed all the day long: and are counted as sheep
appointed to be slame.

Up Lord, why sleep thou: awake, and be not absent from us for ever.

Where fore hides thou thy fare: and forgettest our misery and trouble?

For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust: onr belly eleaueth unto the
ground.

Arise and help us: and deliver us for thy mercies soke.

Eructauit cor meum. Psalm.45
MY heart is inditing of a good matter: I speak of the things which I have
made unto the King.

My tongue is the pen: of a ready writer.

Thou art fairer then the children of men: full of grace are thy lips, because
God has blessed thee for ever.

Girde thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou most mighty: according to
the woship and renown.

Good luck have thou with thine honor: ride on, because of the word of
truth, of meekness, and righteousness, and thy right hand shall teach thee
terrible things.

The arrows are very sharp, and the people shall be subdued unto thee: even in
the mids among the Kings enemies.

Thy seat (O God) endures for ever: the scepter of thy kingdom is a right
scepter.

Thou have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: wherefore God, (even thy
God) has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.

All thy garments smell of Myrrh, Aloes, and Cassia: out of the Iuory palaces,
whereby they have made thee glad.

Kings daughters were among thy honorable Women: upon thy right hand did stand
the Queen in a vesture of gold (wrought about with diverse colors.)

Hearken (O Daughter) and consider, incline thine ear: forget also thine own
people, and thy fathers house.

So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty: for he is thy Lord (God) and
Worship thou him.

And the daughter of Tire shall be there with a gift: like as the rich also among
the people shall make their supplication before thee.

The Kings daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.

She shall be brought unto the king in a raiment of needle work: the virgins
that be her fellows shall bear her company, and shall be brought unto thee.

With joy and gladness shall they be brought: and shall enter into the Kings
palace.

In stead of thy fathers thou shall have children: whom thou may make
princes in all lands.

I Will remember thy name from one generation unto another: therefore shall the
people give thanks unto thee, world without end.

Deus noster refugium. Psalm.46.
GOD is our hope and strength: a very present help in trouble.

I herefore will we not fear though the earth be mooned: and though the hills
be carried into the mids of the sea.

Though the waters there of rage and swell: and though the mountains shake at
the tempest of the same.

The rivers of the flood thereof shall make glad the City of God: the holy
place of the tabernacle of the most highest.

God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be remoned: God shall
help her, and that right early.

The Heathen make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved: but God has showed
his voice, and the earth shall meltaway

The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.

O come hither, and behold the works of the Lord: what destruction he has
brought upon the earth.

He makes werres to cease in all the world: he breaks the bow, and knappeth
the spear in sunder, and burns the chariots it the fine.

Be still then, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen,
and I will be exalted in the earth.

The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.

Omnes gentes plaudite. Psalm.47.
O Clappe your hands together, Evening prayer.
all ye people: O sing unto God with the voice of melody.

For the LORD is high, and to be feared: he is the great King upon all the
earth.

He shall subdue the people under us: and the nations under our feet.

He shall choose out an heritage for us: even the worship of Jacob whom he
loved.

God is gone up with a merry noise: and the Lord with the sound of the trumpe.

O sing praises, sing praises unto (our) God: O sing praises, sing praises unto
our King.

For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with under standing.

God reigns over the heathen: God sits upon his holy seat.

The princse of the people are joined unto the people of the God of Abraham:
for God (which is very high exalted) does defend the earth as it were with a
shield.

Magnus Dominus. Psalm.48.
GReat is the Lord, and highly to be praised: in the city of our God, even
upon his holy hill.

The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole earth: upon the
North side lies the city the great King, God is well known in her palaces,
as a sure refuge.

For lo, the kings of the earth: are gathered and gone by together.

They marueiled to see such things: they were astonished, and suddenly cast down.

Fear came there upon them, and sorrow: as upon a woman in her travail.

Thou shall brake the ships of the sea: through the East Wind.

Like as we have heared, so have we seen in the citte of the Lord of hosts,
in the city of our God: God vpholdeth the same for ever.

We wait for thy loving kindnesfe (O God:) in the mids of thy Temple.

O God, according unto thy Name, so is thy praise unto the worlds end: thy
right hand is full of righteousness.

Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad: because of thy
judgments.

Malke about Sion, and go round about her: and tell the towers thereof.

Mark well her bulwarks, set up her houses: that ye may tell them that come
after.

Forthis God is our God for ever and ever: he shall be our guide unto death.

Audite haec omnes. Psalm.49.
O Hear ye this all ye people: ponder it with your ears all ye that dwell in
the world.

High and low, rich and poor: one with another.

My mouth shall speak of wisedone: and my heart shall muse of understanding.

I will incline mine ear to the parable: and show my dark speech upon the
Harp.

Wherefore should I fear in the days of wickedness: and when ye wickedness of
my heels compasses me round about?

There be some that put their trust in their goods: and boast themselves in the
multitude of their riches.

But no man may deliver his brother: nor make agreement unto God for him.

For it cost more to redeem their souls: so that he must let that alone for
ever.

Yea, though he live long: and see not the grave.

For he feeth that wise men also die, and perish together: as well as the
ignorant and foolish, and leave their riches for other.

And yet they think that their house shall continue for ever: and that their
dwelling places shall endure from one generation to another, and call the
lands after their own names.

Nevertheless, man will not abide in honor: seeing he may be compared unto
the beasts that perish, this is the way of them.

This is their foolishness: and their posterity praise their saying.

They lie in the hell like sheep, death gnameth upon them. and the righteous
shall have domination of them in the morning: their beauty shall consnme in
the sepulcher out of their dwelling.

But God has delivered my soul from the place of hell: for he shall receive
me.

Be not thon afraid though one be made rich: or if the glory of his house be
increased.

For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dies: neither shall his
pomp follow him.

For while he lived, he counted him self an happy man: and so long as thou
do well unto thy self, men will speak good of thee.

He shall follow the generation of his fathers: and shall never see light.

Man being in honor, has no understanding: but is compared unto the beasts
that perish.

Deus deorum. Psalm.50.
THe Lord, Morning prayer.
even the most nughtie God has spoken: and called the world, from the rising
up of the Sun, unto the going down thereof.

Out of Sion has God appeared: in perfect beauty.

Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: there shall go before him a
consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be stirred up rouud about him.

He shall call the heaven from above: and the earth, that he may judge his
people.

Gather my saints together unto me: those that have made a counenant with me
with sacrifice.

And the heavens sall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself.

Hear, O my people, and I will speak: I my self will testify against thee,
O Israel, for I am God, even thy God.

I will not reprove thee, because of thy sacrifices, or for thy burnt
offerings: becanse they were not always before me.

I will take no bullock out of they house: nor he goats out of thy foldes.

For all the beasts of the forest are mine: and so are the castelsis upon a
thousand his.

I know all the fowls upon the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field
are in my sight.

If I be hungry, I will not tell thee: for the whole would is mine, and all
that is therein.

Think thou that I will eat Bulls flesh: and drink the blood of Goats?

Offer unto God thanksgiving: and pay thy vows unto the most Highest.

And call upon me in the time of trouble: so will I hear thee, and thou shall
praise me.

But unto the ungodly satde God: why do thou preach my laws, and take my
covenant in thy mouth?

where as thou hate to be reformed: and have cast my words behind thee.

When thou saw a their, thou consentedst unto him: and have been partakers
with the adulterers.

Thou have let thy mouth speak wickedness: and with thy tongue thou have set
forth deceit.

Thou satest and spakest against thy brother: yea, and have slandered thine
own mothers son.

These things have thou done, and I held my tongue, and thoughtest wickedly,
that I am even such a one as thy self: but I will reprove thee, and set
before thee the things that thou have done.

O consider this, ye that forget God: lest I pluck you away, and there be
none to deliver you.

Who so offers me thanks and praise honors me: and to him that orders
his conversation right, will I show the salvation of God.

Miserere mei Deus. Psalm.51.
Have mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness: according to the
multitude of the mercies do away mine offenses.

Wash me thoughly from my wickedness: and cleanse me from my sin.

For I knowledge my faults: and my sin is ever before me.

Aganst thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou
might be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged.

Behdold, I mas shapen in wickedness: and in sin has my mother couceiued me.

But loc, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shall make me to
understand wisdom secretly.

Thou shall purge me with Hysope, and I shall be clean: thou shall wash me,
and I shall be whiter then snow.

Thou shall make me hear of joy and gladness: that the bones which thou have
broken may rejoice.

Turn thy face from my sins: and put out all my misdeedes.

Make me a clean heart, O God: and renew a rght spirit within me.

Cast me not away from thy presence: and take not thy holy spirit from me.

O give me the comfort of the help again: and stablish me with thy free
spirit.

Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked: and sinners shall be converted
unto thee.

Deliver me from bloodgiltinesse, O God, thou that art the God of my health:
and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.

Thou shall open my lips (O Lord:) and my month shall show thy praise.

For thou desire no sacrifice, else would I give it thee: but thou delightest
not in burnt offerings.

The sacrfice of God is a troubled spirit: a broken and contrite heart (O God)
shall thou not despise.

O be favorable and gracious unto Sion: build thou the Walls of Jerusalem.

Then shall thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the
burnt offerings and oblations: then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine
altar.

Quid gloriaris? Plal. 52.
WHy boastest thou thy self, thou tyrant: that thou can do mischief?

Whereas the goodness of God: endures yet daily.

Thy tongue imagines wickedness: and with lies thou cuttest like a sharp
rasor.

Thou have loved unrighteousness more then goodness: and to talk of lies
more then righteousness.

Thou have loved to speak all words that may do hurt: O thou false tongue.

Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever: he shall take thee, and pluck
thee out of thy dwlling, and root thee out of the land of the living.

The roghteous also shall see this, and fear: and sal laugh him to scorn.

Lo, this is the man that took not Goo for his strength: but trusted unto the
multitude of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.

As for me, I am like a green Olive tree in the house of God: my trust is in
the tender mercy of God for ever and ever.

I will always give thanks unto thee for that thou halst done: and I will
hope in thy name, for thy saints like it well.

Dixit insipiens. psalm. 53.
THe foolish body has said in his heart: there is no God. Evening prayer.


Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their wickednsse: there is none
that does good.

God looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there were any
that would understand, and seek after God.

But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogethee become abominable:
there is also none that does good, no not one.

Are not they without understanding that work wickedness: eating up my people
as if they would eat bread? they have not called upon God.

They were aftaide where no fear was: for God has broken the bones of him
that besieged thee, thou have pnt them to confision, because God has despised
them.

Oh that the Salvation were given unto Israel out of Sion: Oh that the Lord
would deliver his people out of captivity.

Then should Jacob rejoice: and Israel should be right glad.

Deus in nomine. Psalm.54.
Save me, O God, for thy names sake: and avenge me in thy strength.

Hear my prayer, O God: and hearken unto the words of my mouth.

For strangers are risen up against me: and tyrants (which have not God before
their eyes) seek after my soul.

Behold, God is my helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.

He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: destroy thou them in thy truth.

An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy name, O Lord:
because it is so comfortable.

For he has delivered me out of all my trouble: and mine eye has seen his
desire upon mine enemies.

Exaudi Deus. Psalm.55.
Hear my prayer, O God: and hide not thy self from my petition.

Take heed unto me, and hear me: how I mourn in my prayer, and am vexed.

The enemine cries so, and the ungodly comes on so fast: for they are minded
to do me some mischief, so maliciously are they set against me.

My heart is disquieted within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.

Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me: and an horrible dread has
overwhelmed me.

And I said, Oh that I had wings like a Dove: for then would I slay away, and
be at rest.

Lo, then would I get me away far off: and remain in the wilderness.

I would make haste to escape: because of the stormy wind and tempest.

Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them: for I have spied
unrighteousness and strife in the city.

Day and night they go about within the walls threof: misehiefe also and
sorrow are in the mids of it.

Wickedness is therein: deceit and gutle go not out of their streets.

For it is not an open enemy that has done me this dishonor: for then I
could have borne it.

Neither was it mine adversary that did magnify himself against me: for then
(peradventure) I would have hid my self from him.

But it was even thou my companion: my guide, and mine own famihar friend.

We took sweet counsel together: and walked in the house of God as friends.

Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for
wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.

As for me, I will call upon God: and the Lord shall save me.

In the evening and morning, and at noone day will I pray, and that instantly:
and he shall hear my voice.

It is he that has delivered my soul in peace, from the battle that was
against me: for three were many with me.

Yea, even God that endures for ever shall shall hear me, and bring them
downn: for they will not turn, nor fear God.

He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him: and he brake his
covenant.

The words of his mouth were softer then butter, having war in his heart:
his words were smoother then oil, and yet be they very swords.

O cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall nourish thee: and shall not
suffer the righteous to fall for ever.

And as for them: thou, O God, shall bring them into the pit of destruction.

The bloodthirstie and deceitful men shall not live out half their days:
nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.

Miserere mei Deus. Psalm. 56.
BE mereifull unto me, Morning prsyer.
O God, for man goes about to devour me: he is daily fighting and troubling
me.

Mine enemies are daily in hand to swallow me up: for they be many that fight
against me, O thou most Highest.

Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid: yet put I my trust in thee.

I will praise God because of his word: I have put my trust in God, and will
not fear what flesh can do unto me.

They daily mistake my words: all that they imagine, is to do me evil.

They hold all together, and keep themselves close: and mark my steps, when
they lay wait for my soul.

Shall they escape for their wickedness: thou, O God, in thy displeasure shall
cast them down.

Thou tel^st my flittings, put my tears into thy bottell: are not these things
noted in thy book?

Whenever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to slighy: this I
know, for God is on my side.

In Gods word will I rejoice: in the Lords word will I comfort me.

Yea in God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto
me.

Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows: unto thee will I give thanks.

For thou have delivered my soul from death, and my feet form falling: that I
may walk before God in ye light of the living.

Miserere mei Deus. Psalm.57.
Be merecifull unto me, O God, be merrifull unto me, for my soul trusts in
thee: and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refuge, until this tyranny
be ouerpast.

I will call unto the most high God: even unto the God that shall perform the
cause which I have in hand.

He shall send from heaven: and save me from the reproof of him that would eat
me up.

God shall send forth his mercy and truth: my soul is among Lions.

And I lie even amoung the children of men (that are set on fire:) whose teeth
are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

Set up thy self, O God, above the heauns: and chy glory above all the earth.

They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul: they have dug
a pit before me, and are fallen into the mids of it themselves.

My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.

Awake up my glory, awake Lute and Harp: I my self will awake right early.

I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing unto
thee among the nations.

For the greatness of thy mercy reaches unto the heavens: and thy truth unto
the clouds.

Set up thy self, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory about all the earth.

Si vere vtique. Psalm.58.
ARe your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation: and do ye judge ye
thing that is right, O ye sons of men?

Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth: and your hands deal
with wickedness.

The ungodly are froward even from their monthers womb: as soon as they be
borne, they go astray and speak lies.

They are as venomous as the poison of a Serpent: even like the deaf Adder
that stops her ears.

Which refuses to hear the voice of the charmer: charm he never so wisely.

Break their teeth (O God) in their mouths, smite the iawe boues of the
Lions, O Lord: let them fall away like water that tunneth apace, and when they
shoot their arrows, let them be rooted out.

Let them consume away like a Snaile, and be like the untimely fruit of a
woman: and let them not see the funne.

Or ever your pots be made hot with thrones: so let indignation vex him, even
as a thing that is rame.

The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance: he shall wash his
footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.

So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous:
doubtless there is a God that judges the earth.

Eripe me de inimicis. Psalm.59.
Deliver me from mine enemies, Evening prayer.
(O God:) defend me from them that rise against me.

O deliver me from the wicked doers: and save me from the bloodthirsty men.

For lo, they lie waiting for my soul: the mighty men are gathered aganist
me, without any offense or fanlt of me, O Lord.

They run and prepare themselves without my fault: arife thou therefore to
help me, and behold.

Stand up(O Lord God of hosts) thou God of Israel, to viste all the heathen:
and be not merciful unto them that ofsend of malicious wickedness.

They go to and fro in the evening: they grinne like a dog, and run about
through the city.

Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their lips: for who
does hear?

But thou, O Lord, shall have them in derison: and thou shall laugh all the
heathen to scorn.

My strength will I aseribe unto thee: for thou art the God of my refuge.

God shows me his goodness plenteonsly: and God shall let me see desire bpon
mine enemies.

Slay them not, left my people forget it; but scatter them abroad among the
people, and put them down, O Lord, our defense.

For the sin their mouth, and for the words of their lips, they shall be
taken in their pride: and why? their preaching is of cursing and lies.

Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish: and know that
it is God which rules in Jacob, and unto the ends of the world.

And in the evening they will return: grinne like a Dog, and will go about the
city.

They will run here and there for meat: and grudge if they be not satisfied.

As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy betimes in
the morning: for thou have been my Defense and refuge in the day of my trouble.

Unto thee (O my strength) will I sing: for thou, O God, art my refuge, and my
merciful God.

Deus repulisti nos. Psalm.60.
O God, thou have cast us out, and scattered us abroad: thou have also been
displeascd, O turn thec unto us again.

Thou have moved the land, and divided it: heal the fores thereof, for it
shakes.

Thou have showed thy people heavy things: thou have given us a drink of
deadly wine.

Thou have given a token for such as fear thee: that they may triumph because
of the truth.

Therefore were thy beloved delivered: help me with thy rtght hand and hear me.

God has spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice and divide Sichem: and mete
out the valley of Succoth.

Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the streangth of my
head, Judah is my lawgiuer.

Moab is my washpot, over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia be thou glad
of me.

Who will lead me into the strong city: who will bring me into Edom?

Have thou not cast us out, O God: will not thou, O God, go out with our hosts?

O be thou out help in trouble: for baine is the help of man.

Through God will we do great acts: for it is he that shall tread down our
enemies.

Exaudi Deus. Psalm.61.
Hear my crying, O God: give ear unto my prayer.

From the ends of the earth will I call unto thee: when my heart is in
heaviness.

O set me up upon the rock that is higher then I: for thou have been my hope,
and a strong tower for me against the enemy.

I will dwell in thy Taberanacle for ever: and my trust shall be under the
covering of thy wings.

For thou, O Lord, have heard my desires: and have given an heritage unto those
that fear thy Name.

Thou shall grant the king a long life: that his years may endure throughout
all generations.

He shall dwell before God for ever: O prepare thy loving mercy and
faithfulness, that they may preserve him.

So will I alwalyes sing praise bnto thy Name: that I may daily perform my
vows.

Nonne Deo. Psalm.62.
MY soul truly waits still upon God: for of him comes my salvation.
Morning prayer.


He berely is my strength and my salvation: he is my defense, so that I shall
not greatly fall.

How long will ye imagine mischief against every man: ye shall be slaline all
the sort of you, yea as a tottering wall shall ye be, and like a broken hedge.

Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt: their delight is
in lies, they give good words with their mouth, but curse with their herat.

Nevertheless, my soul wait thou still upon God: for my hope is in him.

He truly is my strength and my salvation: he is my defencc, so that I shall
not fall.

In GOD is my health and my glory: the rock of my might, and in God is my
trust.

O put your trust in him always (ye people:) power out your hearts before him,
for God is our hope.

As for the children of men, they are but baine: the children of men are
deceitful upon the weights, they are altogether lighter then vanity it self.

O trust not in wrong and robbery, give not your felues unto vanity: if
riches increase, set not your heart upon them.

God spoke once and wife: I have also heard the same, that power belongs unto
God.

And that thou Lord art mereifull: for thou rewardest every man according to
his work.

Deus Deus meus. Psalm.63.
O God, thou art my God: early will I seek thee.

My soul thirsts for thee, my flesh also longs after thee: in a barren and
dry land, where no matter is.

Thus have I looked for thee in holiness: that I might behold thy power and
glory.

For thy loutng kindness is better then the life it self: my lips shall
praise thee.

As long as I live, will I magnify thee on this manner: and lift up my hands in
thy name.

My soul shall be satisfied even as it were with marowe and fatness: when my
mouth prayseth thee with joyful lips.

Have I not remembered thee in my bed: and thought bpon thee when I was waking?

Beacause thou have been my helper: therefore under the shadow of my wings
will I rejoice.

My soul hangs upon thee: thy right hand has vpholdeli me.

These also that seek the hurt of my soul: they shall go under the earth.

Lat them fall upon the edge of the sword: that they may be aportion for forces.

But the King shall rejoice in God, all they also that swear by him, shall be
commended: for the mouth of them that speak lies, shall be stopped.

Exaudi Deus. psalm. 64.
Hear my boyee, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.

Hide me from the gathering together of the froward: and from the insurrection
of the wicked doers.

Which have whet their tongue like a sword: and shot out there arrows, even
bitter words.

That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: suddenly do they hit
him, and fear not

They courage themselves in mischief: and commune among themselves hom they
may lay snares, and fay that no man shall see them.

They imagine wickedness and practice it: that they keep secret among
themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.

But god shall snddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow: that they shall be
wounded.

Yea their own tongues shall make them fall: in so much that who so feeth
them, shall laugh them to srone.

And all men that see it, shall say, This has God done: for they shall
perceive that it is his work.

The rightcous shall rejoice in the Lord, and put hist trust in him: and all
they that are true of heart, shall be glad.

Te decet hymnus. Psalm. 65.
THou, Evening prayer.
O God, art praised in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed in
Jerusalem.

Thou that hear the prayer: unto thee shall all flesh come.

My misdeeds prevail against me: oh be thou merciful unto our sins.

Blessed is the man whom thou choosest and received unto thee: he shall dwell in
thy court, and shall be satisfid with ye pleasures of thy house, even of thy holy
temple.

Thou shall show us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O God of our
salvation: thou that art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them
that remain in the broad sea.

Which in his streangth sets fast the mountains; and is (...) about with
power.

Which stilleth the raging of the Sea: and the noise of his waves, and the
madness of his people.

They also that dwell in the vettermost parts of the earth, shall be afraid at
thy tokens: thou that make the outgoings of the morning and euning to praise
thee.

Thou bistest the earth, and blessest it: thou make it very plenteous.

The river of God is full of water: thou preparest their corn, for so thou
prouidest for the earth.

Thou waterest her furrows, thou sendest rain into the little valleys
thereof: thou make it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the increase
of it.

Thou crownest the year with thy goodness: and thy clouds drop fatness.

They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness: and the lilttle hills
shall rejoice on every side.

The folds shall be full of sheep: the ballelyes also shall stand so thick with
corn, that they shall laugh and sing.

Iubilate Deo. Psalm. 66.
O Be joyful in God all ye lands: sing praises unto the honor of his Name,
make his praise to be glorious.

Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works: through the greatness
of thy power shall thine enemies be found liars bnto thee.

For all the word shall worship thee: sing of thee, and praise thy Name.

O come hither: and behold the morks of God: how wonderful he is in his doing
to ward the children of men.

He turned the sea into dry land: so that they went through the water on
foot, there did we rejoice thereof.

He rules with his power for ever, his eyes behold the people: and such as
will not believe, shall not be able to exalt themselves.

O praise our God (ye people:) and make the voice of his praise to be heard.

Which holds our soul in life: and suffers not out feet to slip.

For thou (O God) have proved us: thou also have tried us, like as silver is
tried.

Thou broughtest us into the snare: and layedst trouble upon our loins.

Thou sufferedest men to ride over our heads: we went through fire and water,
and thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.

I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: and will pay thee my bows which
I promised with my lips, and spoke with my mouth when I was in trouble.

I will offer unto thee fat burnt sacrifices, with the incense of rams: I
will offer bullockes and goats.

O come hither, and bearken all ye that fear God: and I will tell you what he
has done for my soul.

I called unto him with my mouth: and gave himpraises with my tongue.

If I incline unto wickedness with my heart: the Lord will not hear me.

But God has heared me: and considered the voice of my prayer.

Praised be God, which has not cast out my prayer: nor turned his mercy from
me.

Deus misereatur. Psalm.67.
GOd be merciful unto us and blcsse us: ant show us the light of his
countenance, and be merciful unto bs.

That thy way may be known bpon earth: thy saving health among all nations.

Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise thee.

O let the nations rejoice and be glad, for thou shall judge the folk
righteoufly: and govern the nations upon earth.

Let the people prase thee, O God: let all the people praise thee.

Then shall the earth bring forth her increase: and God, even our own God,
shall give us his blessing.

God shall bless bs: and all the ends of the world sbal fear him.

Exurgat Deus. Psalm. 68.
LEt God arise, Morning prayer.
anb let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him, slay before
him.

Like as the smoke vanishes, so shall thou briue them away: and like as ware
melts at the fire, so let the ungodly perith at the presence of God.

But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God: let them also be ney
and joyful.

O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Nmme: magnify him that rides upon
the heavens as it were upon an horse, praise him in his Name, yea, and rejoice
before him.

He is father of the fatherless, and defends the cause of the widomes: even
God in his holy habitation.

He is the God that makes men to be of one mind in an house, and brings
the prisoners out of captivity: but lets the runnagates continue in
scarceness.

O God, when thou wentest forth before the people: when thou wentest through
the wilderness.

The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God: enen as
Sinai also was mooueb at the presence of God, which is the God of Israel.

Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance: and refreshedst
it when it was weary.

Thy congregation shall dwell therein: for thou, O God, have of the goodness
prepared for the poor.

The Lord gave the word: great was the company of the preachers.

Kings with their armies did flee and were discomfited: and they of the
household divided the spoil.

Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a Dove:
that is conered with silver wings, and her feathers like gold.

When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake: then were they as white as
snow in Salmon.

As the hill of Basan, so is Gods hill: even an high hill, as the hill of Basan.

Why hop ye so ye high hills? this is Gods hill, in the which it pleases him
to dwell: yea, the Lord will abide in it for ever.

The charets of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of Angels: and the Lord
is among them as in the holy place of Sinai.

Thou art gone up on high, thou have led captivity captive, and received gifts
for men: yea, even for thy enemies, that the Lord might dwell among them.

Praised be the Lord daily: even the God which helps us, and powers his
benefits upon us.

He is our God, even the God of whom comuneth salvation: God is the Lord, by
whom we escape death.

GOD shall wound the head of his enemies: and the hairie scalpe of such a one
as goes on still in his wickedness.

The Lord has said, I will bring my people again, as I did from Basan: mine
own will I bring again, as I did sometime from the deep of the sea.

That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies: and that the
tongue of thy dogs may be red through the same.

It is well seen, O God, how thou go: how thou my God and King go in
the Sanctuary.

The singers go before, the minstrels follow after: in the midst are the
damsels playing with their timbrels.

Give thanks, O Israel, unto God the Lord in the Congregations: from the
ground of the heart.

There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah their counsel:
the princes of Zabulon, and the princes of Nephthali.

Thy God has sent forth strength for thee: stablish the thing, O God, that
thou have wrought in us.

For thy Temples sake at Jerusalem: so shall Kings bring presents unto thee.

When the company of the spearemen, and multitude of the mighty are scattered
abroad among the beasts of the people (so that they humbly bring pieces of
silver:) and when he has scattered the people that delight in war.

Then shall the princes come out of Egypt: the Morians land shall soon stretch
out her hands unto God.

Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth: O sing praises unto the Lord.

Which sits in the heavens over all from the beginning: lo, he does send
out his voice, yea, and that a mighty voice.

Ascribe ye the power to God over Isral: his worship and strength is in the
clouds.

O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: even the God of Isral, he will
give strength and power unto his people, blessed be God.

Saluum me. Psalm. 69.
Save me, Evening prayer.
O God: for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.

I stick fast in the deep mire where no ground is: I am come into deep
waters, so that the floods run over me.

I stick fast in the deep mire where no ground is: I am come into deep
waters, so that the floods run over me.

I am weary of crying, my throat is dry: my sight fails me for waiting so
long upon my God.

They that hate me without a canse, are more then the hairs of my head: they
that are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless, are mighty.

I paid them the things that I never took: God thou know my simpleness,
and my faults are not hid from thee.

Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashmmed for my
cause: let not those that seek thee, be confounded through me, O Lord God of
Israel.

And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproose: shame has covered my face.

I am become a stranger unto my brethren: even an aliant unto my mothers
children.

For the zeal of thy house has even eaten me: and th rebukes of them that
rebuked thee, are fallen upon me.

I wept and chasened my self with fasting: and that was turned to my reproof.

I put on a fackcloth also: and they iested upon me.

They that sit in the gate speak against me: and the drunkards make songs upon
me.

But Lord, I make my prayer unto thee: in an acceptable time.

Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy: even in the truth of thy
salvation.

Take me out of the mire, that I sink not: Oh let me be delivered from them
that hate me, and out of the deep waters.

Let not the water flood drown me, neithr let the deep swallow me up: and
let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.

Hear me, O Lord, for thy loving kindness is comfortable: turn thee unto
me, according to the multitude of thy mercies.

And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble: Oh haste thee,
and hear me.

Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it: Oh deliver me, because of mine enemies.

Thou have known my reproof, my shame, and my dishonor: mine adversaries are
all in thy sight.

Thy rebuke has broken my heart, I am full of heaviness: I looked for some to
have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I any to comfort me.

They gave me gall to eat: and when I was thirsty, they gave me vinegar to
drink.

Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal: and let the
things, that should have been for their wealth, be unto them an occasion of
falling.

Let their eyes be blinded that they see not: and ever bow down their backs.

Power out thine indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful displeasure take
hold of them.

Let their habitation be void: and no man to dwell in their tents.

For they perseeute him whom thou have smitten: and they talk how they may
vere them whom thou have wounded.

Let them fall from one wickedness to another: and not come into thy
righteousness.

Let them be wiped out of the book of the living: and not be wirtten among the
righteous.

As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness: thy help, O God, shall lift me
up.

I will praise the Name of God with a song: and magnify it with thanksgiving.

This also shall please the Lord: better then a bullock, that has horns and
hoofes.

The humble shall consider this, and be glad: seek ye after God, and your
soul shall live.

For the Lord hears the poor: and despises not his prisoners.

Let heaven and earth praise him: the sea and all that moves therein.

For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah: that men may dwell
there, and have it in possession.

The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his
Name, shall dwell therem.

Deus in adiutorium. Psalm. 70.
HAste thee, O God, to deliver me: make haste to help me, O Lord.

Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be
turned backward and put to confusion that with me evil.

Let them for their reward be soon brought to shame: that cry over me, There,
there.

But let all those that seek thee, be joyful and glad in three: and let all
such as delight in thy salvation, say always, The Lord be praised.

As for me, I am poor and in misery: haste thee unto me, O God.

Thou art my helper and my redeemer: O Lord make no long tarying.

In te Domine speraui. Psalm. 71.
IN thee, Morning prayer.
O Lord, have I put my trust, let me never be put to confusion: but rid me, and
deliver me in thy rigteousnesse, incline thine ear unto me, and save me.

Be thou my strong hold, whereunto I may always resort: thou have promised to
help me, for thou art my house of defense, and my castle.

Deliver me, O my God, out of (...) hand of the ungodly: out of the hand of the
unrighteous and cruel man.

For thou, O Lord God, art the thing that I long for: thou art my hope, even
from my youth.

Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was borne: thou art he that
took me out of my mothers womb, my praise shall be always of thee.

I am become as it where a monster unto many: but my sure trust is in thee.

O let my mouth be filled with thy praise: that I may sing of thy glory, and
honor all the day long.

Caft me not away in the time of age: forsake me not when my strength fails me.

For mine enemies speak against me, and they that lay wait for my soul, take
their counsel together, saying: God has forsaken him, persecute him, and take
him, for there is none to deliver him.

Go not far from me, O God: my God, haste thee to help me.

Let them be confounded and perish, that are against my soul: let them be
covered with shame and dishonor, that seek to do me evil.

As for me, I will patiently abide always: and will praise thee more and more.

My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation: for I know no
end thereof.

I will go fooeth in the strength of the Lord God: and will make mention of thy
righteousness only.

Thou, O God, have taught me from my youth up until now: therefore will I
tell of thy wondrous works.

Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray headed: until I have
showed thy stength unto this generation, and thy power to all them that are yet
for to come.

Thy righteousness, O God, is very high: and great things are they that thou
have done, O God, who is like unto thee?

O what great troubles and adversities have thou showed me, and yet did
thou turn and refresh me: yea, and broughtest me from the deep of the earth
again.

Thou have brought me to great honor: and comforted me on every side.

Therefore will I praise thee and thy faithfulness (O God) playing upon an
instrument of music: unto thee will I sing upon the Harp, O thou holy one of
Israel.

My lips will be saine when I sing unto thee: and so will my soul whom thou
have delivered.

My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are
confounded and brought unto shame that seek to do me evil.

Deus iudicium. Psalm. 72.
Give the king thy iudge^ents (O God:) and thy righreousnesse unto the kings
son.

Then shall he judge the people according unto right: and defend the poor.

The mountains also shall bring peace: and the little hills rightwousnes unto
the people.

He shall keep the simple folk by their right: defend the children of the
poor, and punish the wrong doer.

They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endures: from one
generation to another.

He shall come down like the rain into a sleece of wool: even as the drops
that water the earth.

In his time shall the righteous flourish: yea, and abundance of peace, so
long as the Moon endures.

His dominion shall be also from the one Sea to the other: and from the flood
unto the worlds end.

They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him: his enemies shall
lick thy dust.

The kings of Tharsis and of the Isles shall give presents: the Kings of Arabia
and Saba shall bring gifts.

All Kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall do him service.

For the shall deliver the poor when he cries: the needy also, and him that
has no helper.

He shall be favorable to the sinple and needy: and shall preserve the souls
of the poor.

He shall deliver their souls from falsehoode and wrong: and dear shall their
blood be in his sight.

He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia: prayer shall be
made ever unto him, and daily shall he be Praised.

There shall be an heap of corn in the earth high upon the hills: his fruit
shall shake like Libanus, and shall be green in the city, like grass upon the
earth.

His Name shall endure for ever, his Name shall remain under the sun among
the posterities: which shall be blessed through him, and all the heathen shall
praise him.

Blessed be the Lord God, even the God of Israel: which only does wondrous
things.

And blessed be the Name of his Majesty for ever: and all the earth shall be
filled with his Majesty. Amen, Amen.

Quam bonus Israel. Psalm. 73.
Truly God is loung unto Israel: cuen unto such as are of a clean heart.
Evening prayer.


Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone: my treadings had welning slipped.

And why? I was grieved at the wicked: I do also fee the ungodly in such
prosperity.

For they are in no peril of death: but are lusty and strong.

They come in no misfortune like other folk: neither are they plagued like
other men.

And this is the cause that they be so holden with pride: and overwhelmed with
crurltie.

Their eyes swel with fatnes: and they do even what they lust.

They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy: their talking is against
against the most highest.

For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven: and their tongue goes
through the world.

Therefore fall the people unto them: and thereout suck they no small
advantage.

Tush (say they) how should God perceive it: is there knowledge in the most
highest?

Lo, these are the ungodly, these prosper in the world, and these have riches
in possession: and I said, Then have I cleanfed my heart in vain, and washed
mine hands in innocence.

All the day long have I been punished: and chastened every morning.

Yea, and I had almost said even as they: but lo, then should I have
condemned the generation of thy children.

Then thought I to understand this: but it was too hard for me.

Until I went into the Sanctuary of God: then understood I the end of these
men.

Namely how thou do set them in slipperie places: and castest them down,
and destroyest them.

Oh how suddenly do they consume: perish, and come to a fearful end?

Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh: so shall thou make their image to
vanish out of the city.

Thus my heart was grieved: and it went even through my reins.

So foolish was I and ignorant: even as it were a beast before thee.

Nevertheless, I am always by thee: for thou have holden me by my right hand.

Thou shall guide me with thy counsel: and after that receive me with glory.

Whom have I in heaven but thee: and there is none upon earth that I desire in
comparison of thee.

My flesh and my heart fails: but God is the strength of my heart, and my
portion for ever.

For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish: thou have destroyed all them
that commit fornication against thee.

But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in the Lord
God: and to speak of all thy works (in the gates of the daughter of Sion.)

Vt quid Deus. Psalm. 74.
O God, wherefore art thou absent from us so long: why is thy wrath so hot
against the sheep of thy pasture?

O think upon thy Congregation: whom thou have purchased and redeemed of old.

Think upon upon the tribe of thine inheritance: and mount Sion wherein thou
have dwelt.

Lift up thy feet, that thou may utterly destroy every enemy: which has
done evil in thy Sanctuary.

Thine adversaries roar in the mids of thy Congregatious: and set up their
banners for to tokens.

He that hewed timber before out of the thick trees: was known to bring it to
an excellent work.

But now they break down all the carved work thereof: with axes and hammers.

They have set fire upon thy holy places: and have defiled the dwelling place
of thy Name, even unto the ground.

Yea, they said in their hearts, let us make havoc of them altogether: thus
have they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.

We see not our tokens, there is not one Prophet more: no not one is there
among us that understands any more.

O God, how long syall the adversary do this dishonor: holy long shall the
enemy blaspheme thy Name, for ever?

Why withdrawest thou thy hand: Why pluckest not thou thy right hand out of thy
bosom to consume the enemy?

For God is my king of old: the help that is done upon earth, he does it
himself.

Thou did divide the sea through thy power: thou brakest the heads of the
Dragons in the matters.

Thou sinotest the heads of Liuiathan in pieces: and gave him to be meat for
the people in the Wilderness.

Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks: thou driedst
up mighty Waters.

The day is thine, and the night is thine: thou have prepared the light and the
sun.

Thou have set all the borders of the earth: thou haft made Summer and Winter.

Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy has rebuked: and how the foolish people
has blasphemed thy Name.

O deliver not the soul of thy Turtle Dove unto the multitude of the enemies:
and forget not the congregation of the poor for ever.

Look upon the covenant: for all the earth is full of darkness, and cruel
habitations.

Oh let not the simple go away ashamed: but let the poor and needy give
praise unto thy Name.

Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause: remember how the foolish man
blasphemeth thee daily.

Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the presumption of them that hate thee,
increases ever more and more.

Confitebimur tibi. Psalm. 75.
Unto thee, Morning prayer.
O God, do We give thanks: yea, unto thee do we give thanks.

Thy Name also is so nigh: and that do thy wondrous works declare.

When I receive the Congregation: I shall judge according unto right.

The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: I bear up the pillars of
it.

I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly: and to the ungodly, Set not up
your horn.

Set not up your horn on high: and speak not with a stiff neck.

For promotion comes neither from the East nor from the West: nor yet from
the South.

And why? God is the Judge: he puts down one, and sets up another.

For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full
mixed, and he powers out of the same.

As for the dregs thereof: all the ungodly of the earth shall drink them, and
suck them out.

But I will talk of the God of Jacob: and praise him for ever.

All the horns of the ungodly also will I break: and the horns of the
righteous shall be exalted.

Notus in Judea. Psalm 76.
IN Jury is God known: his Name is great in Israel.

At Salem is his tabernacle: and his dwelling in Sion.

There brake he the arrows of the bow: the shield, the sword, and the
battle.

Thou art of more honor and might: then the hills of the robbers.

The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep: and all the men, whole
hands were mighty, have found nothing.

At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob: both the charet and horse are fallen.

Thou, even thou art to be feared: and who may stand in thy fight when thou art
angry?

Thou did cause thy judgment to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled
and was still.

When God arose to indgement: and to help all the meek upon earth.

The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise: and the fierceness of them
shall thou refrain.

Promise unto the Lord your God, and keep it, all ye that be round about him
bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.

He shall refrain the spirit of princes: and is wonderful among the kings of
the earth.

Voce mea ad Dominum. Psalm. 77.
I Will cry unto God with my voice: even unto God will I cry with my voice,
and he shall hearken unto me.

In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: my fore ran and ceased not, in
the night season my soul refused comfort.

When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God: when my heart is vexed, I
will complain.

Thou hold mine eyes waking: I am so feeble that I cannot speak.

I have considered the days of old: and the years that are past.

I call to remembrance my song: and in the night I commune with mine own
heart, and search out my spirits.

Will the Lord absent himself for ever: and will he be no more entreated?

Is his mercy clean gone for ever: and is his promise come utterly to an end
for evermore?

Has God forgotten to be gracious: and will he shut up his loving kindness in
displeasure?

And I said, It is mine own infirmity: but I will remember the years of the
right hand of the most highest.

I will remember the works of the Lord: and call to mind thy wonders of old
time.

I will think also of all thy works: and my talking shall be of thy doings.

Thy way, O God is holy: who is so great a God (as our God?)

Thou art the God that does wonders: and have declared thy power among the
people.

Thou have mightily delivered thy people: even the sons of Jacob and Joseph

The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid: the depthes
also were troubled.

The clouds powered out water, the air thundered: and thine arrows went
abroad.

The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: the lightnings shone upon the
ground, the earth was moved, and shook withal.

Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters: and thy footsteps
are not known.

Thou leddest thy people like sheep: by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

Attendite popule. Psalm. 78.
Hear my Law, Evening prayer.
O my people: incline your ears unto the words of my mouth.

I will open my mouth in a parable: I will declare hard sentences of old.

Which we have heard and known: and such as our fathers have told us.

That we should not hide them from the children of the generations to come:
but to show the honor of the Lord, his mighty and wonderful works that
he has done.

He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a Law: which he commanded our
forefathers to teach their children.

That their posterity might know it: and the children which were yet unborn.

To the intent that when they came up: they might show their children the same.

That they might put their trust in God: and not to forget the works of God,
but to keep his commandments.

And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubburne generation: a
generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit cleaves not
steadfastly unto God.

Like as the children of Ephraim: which being harnessed and carrying bows,
turned themselves back in the day of battle.

They kept not the covenant of God: and would not walk in his Law.

But forgate what he had done: and the wonderful work that he had showed for
them.

Marvelous things did he in the sight of our forefathers in the land of
Egypt: even in the field of Zoan.

He dinided the sea, and let them go through: he made the waters to stand on
an heap.

In the day time also he led them with a cloud: and all the night through with
a light of fire.

He claue the hard rocks in the wilderness: and gave them drink thereof, as
it had been out of the great depth.

He brought waters out of the stony rock: so that it gushed out like the
rivers.

Yet for all this they sinned more against him: and provoked the most highest
in the wilderness.

They tempted God in their hearts: and required meat for their lust.

They spoke against God also, saying: Shall God prepare a table in the
wilderness?

He smote the stony rock deed, that the water gushed out, and the streams
flowed withal: but can he give bread also, or provide flesh for his people?

When the Lord heard this, he was wroth: so the fire was kindled in Jacob, and
there came up heavy displeasure against Israel.

Because they believed not in God: and put not their trust in his help.

So he commanded the clouds above: and opened the doors of heaven.

He rained down Manna also upon them for to eat and gave them food from
heaven.

So man did eat Angels food: for he sent them meat enough.

He caused the Cast wind to blow under heaven: and through his power he
brought in the Southwest wind.

He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust: and feathered fowls like as the
sand of the sea.

He let it fall among their tents: even round about their habitation.

So they did eat and were well filled, for he gave them their own desire:
they were not disappointed of their lust.

But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon
them, and flue the wealthiest of them: yea, and smote down the chosen men that
were in Israel.

But for all this they sinned yet more: and believed not his wondrous works.

Therefore their days did he consume in vanity: and their years in trouble.

When he flewe them, they sought him: and turned them early, and enquired
after God.

And they remembered that God was their strength: and that the high God was
their redeemer.

Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth: and dissembled with
him in their tongue.

For their heart was not whole with him: neither continued they steadfast in his
covenant.

But he was so merciful that forgave their misdeedes: and destroyed them not.

Yea many a time turned he his wrath away: and would not suffer his whole
displeasure to arise.

For he considered that they were but flesh: and that they were even a wind
that passes away, and comes not again.

Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness: and grieved him in the
desert.

They turned backed, and tempted God: and moved the holy one in Israel.

They thought not of his hand: and of the day when he delivered them from the
hand of the enemy.

How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt: and his wonders in the field of Zoan.

He turned their waters into blood: so that they might not drink of the rivers.

He sent lice among them, and devoured them up: and frogs to destroy them.

He gave their fruit unto the Caterpiller: and their labor unto the
Grasshopper.

He destroyed their Vines with hailestones: and their Mulberie trees with the
frost.

He smote their cattle also with hailestones: and their flocks with hot
thunderbolts.

He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure, and
trouble: and sent evil angels among them.

He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from dearth: but
gave their life over to the pestilence.

And smote all the first borne in Egypt: the most principal and mightiest in
the dwellings of Ham.

But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep: and carried them in
the wilderness like a slocke.

He brought them out safely that they should not fear: and overwhelmed their
enemies with the sea.

And brought them within the borders of his Sanctuary: even to his mountain
which he purchased with his right hand.

He cast out the heathen also before them: caused their land to be divided
among them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Isael to dwell in their
tents.

So they tempted and displeased the most high God: and kept not his testimonies.

But turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers: starting aside
like a broken bow.

For they grieved him with their hill altars: and provoked him to displeasure
with their images.

When God heard this, he was wroth: and took fore displeasure at Israel.

So that he forsook the Tabernacle in Slid: even the rent that he had pitched
among them.

He delivered their power into captivity: and their beauty into the enemies
hand.

He gave his people over also unto the sword: and was wroth with his
inheritance.

The fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not given to marriage.

Their Priests were slain with the sword: and three were no widows to make
lamentation.

So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep: and like a Giant refreshed with wine.

He smote his enemies in the hinder parts: and put them to a perpetual shame.

He refused the Tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim.

But chose the tribe of Judah: even the hill of Sion, which he loved.

And there he builded his temple on high: and laid the foundation of it like
the ground which he has made continually.

He chose David also his servant: and took him away from the sheep foldes.

As he was following the Ewes great with young ones, he took him: that he might
feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

So he fed them with a faithful and true heart: and ruled them prudently with
all his power.

Deus, venerunt. Psalm. 79.
O God, Morning prayer.
the heathen are come into thine inheritance: thy holy temple have they
defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.

The dead bodies of thy feruants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of
the air: and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the land.

Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem: and there
was no man to bury them.

We are become an open shame to our enemies: a very scorn and derision unto
them that are round about us.

Lord, how long will thou be angry: shall thy jealousy burn like fire for
ever?

Power out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known thee: and
upon the kingdoms that have not called unto thy name.

For they have devoured Jacob: and laid waste his dwelling place.

O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon: for we
are come to great misery.

Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: O deliver us, and
be merciful unto our sins for thy names sake.

Wherefore do the heathen say: where is now their God?

O let the bengeance of thy servants blood that is shed: be openly showed upon
the heathen in our sight.

O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee: according to
the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die.

And for the blasphemy where with our neighbors have blasphemed thee: reward
thou them, O Lord, seven fold into their bosom.

So we that be thy people and sheep of thy pastare, shall give thee thanks
for ever: and will always be showing forth thy praise from generation to
generation.

Qui regis Israel. Psalm. 80.
Hear, O thou shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep:
show thy self also thou that fittest upon the Cherubims.

Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses stir up thy strength, and come and
helps us.

Turn us again, O God: show the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.

O Lord God of hosts: how long will thou be angry with thy people that prays?

Thou feedest them with the br^au of tears: and give them plenteousnesse of
tears to or^ke.

Thou have made us a very ^rife unto our neighbors: and our enemies laugh us
to scorue.

Turn us again, thou God of hosies: show the light of thy countenance, and
we shall be whole.

Thou have brought a vine out of Egypt: thou have cast out the heathen, and
planted it.

Thou made room^ for it: and when it had taken root, it filled the land.

The hills were covered with the shadow of it: and the boughs thereof were
like the goodly Cedar trees.

She streched out her branches unto the sea: and her boughs unto the river.

Why have thou then broken down her hedge: that all they which go by, ^lucke
off her grapes?

The wild Bore out of the wood does root it up: and the wild beasts of the
field devour it.

Turn th^e again thou God of hosts, look down from heaven: behold, and
visit this vine.

And the place of the vineyard, that thy right hand has plansed: and the
branch that thou made so strong for thy self.

It is burnt with fire, and cut down: and they shall perish at the rebuke of
thy countenance.

Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: and upon the son of man whom
thou made so strong for thine own self.

And so will not we go back from the: O let us live, and we shall call upon
thy name.

Lurne us again, O Lord God of hosts: show the light of thy counte^a^ce, and
we shall be whole.

Exultate Deo. Psalm. 81.
SIng we merrily unto God our strength: make a cheerful noise unto the God of
Jacob.

Take the Psalm, bring hither the Tabret: the merry Harp, with the Lute.

Blow up the Trumpet in the new Moon: even in the time appointed, and upon
our solemn feast day.

For this was made a statute for Israel: and a ^awe of the God of Jacob.

This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony: when he came out of the land of
Egypt, and had heard a strange language.

I cased his shoulder from the burden: and his hands were delivered from making
the pots.

Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee: and heard thee what
time as the storm fell upon thee.

I proved thee also: at the waters of strife.

Hear, O my people, and I will assure thee, O Israel: if thou will hearken
unto me.

There shall no strange God be in thee: neither shall thou worship any other
God.

I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy
mouth wide, and I shall fill it.

But my people would not hear my voice: and Israel would not obey me.

So I gave them up unto their own hearts lust: and let them follow their own
imaginations.

O that my people would have hearkened unto me: for if Israel had walked in my
ways.

I should soon have put down their enemies: and turned my hand against their
adversaries.

The haters of the Lord should have been found liars: but their time should
have endured for ever.

He should have fed them also with the finest wheat flower: and with honey
out of the stony rock should I have satisfied thee.

Deus stetit. Psalm. 82.
GOd stands in the congregation of princes: he is a judge among gods.
Evening prayer.


How long will ye give wrong judgment: and accept the persons of the ungodly?

Defend the poor and fatherless: see that such as be in need and
necessity, have right.

Deliver ye outcast and poor: save them from the hand of ye ungodly.

They will not be learned, nor understand, but walk on still in darkness: all
the foundations of the earth be out of course.

I have said, Ye are gods: and ye all are children of the most Highest.

But ye shall die like men: and fall like one of the princes.

Arise, O God, and judge thou the earth: for thou shall take all heathen to
thine inheritance.

Deus quis similis? Psalm. 83.
HOld not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence: refrain not thy self, O
God.

For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring: and they that hate thee, have lift up
their head.

They have imagined crastily against thy people: and taken counsel against
thy secret ones.

They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no more a
people: and that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

For they have cast their heads together with one consent: and are confederate
against thee.

The tabernacles of the Edomites and the Ismaelites: the Moabites, and the
Hagarenes.

Gebal and Ammon, and Amalech: the Philistines, with them that dwell at Tire.

Assure also is joined unto them: and have helped the children of Lot.

But do thou to them as unto the Madianites: unto Sisera, and unto Iabin, at
the brook of Kison.

Which perished at Endor: and became as the doung of the earth.

Make them and their Princes like Oreb and Zeb: yea, make all their Princes
like Zeba an Salmana.

Which say, Let us take to our selves: the houses of God in possession.

O my God, make them like unto a wheel: and as the stubble before the wind.

Like as the fire that burns up the wood: and as the flame that confumeth the
mountains.

Persecute them even so with thy tempest: and make them afraid with thy storm.

Make their faces ashamed, O Lord: that they may seek thy name.

Let them be confounded and bexed ever more and more: let them be put to shame
and perish.

And they shall know that thou, whose name is Jehovah: art only the most
highest over all the earth.

Quam dilecta. Psalm. 84.
O How amiable are thy dwellings: thou Lord of hosts!

My soul has a desire and longing to enter into the Courts of the Lord: my
heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.

Yea, the sparrowe has found her an house, and the swallow a nest, where she
may lay her young: even thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.

Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be always praising thee.

Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee: in whose heart are thy ways.

Which going through the vale of misery, use it for a well: and the pooles are
filled with water.

They will go from strength to strength: and unto the God of gods appears
every one of them in Sion.

O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: hearken, O God of Jacob.

Behold, O God our defender: and look upon the fare of thine anointed.

For one day in thy courts: is better then a thousand.

I had rather be a door keeper in the house of my God: then to dwell in the
tents of ungodliness.

For the Lord God is a light and defense: the Lord will give grace and
worship, and no good thing shall he withhold from them that live a godly life.

O Lord God of hosts: blessed is the man that puts his trust in thee.

Benedixisti Domine. Psalm.85.
LOrd, thou art become gracions unto thy land: thou have turned away the
captuitie of Jacob.

Thou have forgiven the offense of thy people: covered all their sins.

Thou have taken away all thy displeasure: and turned thy self from thy
wrathful indignation.

Turn us then, O God our Savior: and let thine anger cease from us.

Will thou be displeased at us for ever: and will thou stretch out thy wrath
from one generation to another?

Will thou not turn again and quicken us: that thy people may rejoice in thee?

Show us thy mercy, O Lord: and grant us thy salvation.

I will hearken what the Lord God will say concerning me: for he shall speak
peace unto his people, and to his saints that they turn not again.

For his salvation is high them that fear him: that glory may dwell in our
land.

Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed each
order.

Truth shall slorish out of the earth and righteousness has looked dowme
from heaven.

Yea, the Lord shall show loving kindness: and our land shall give her
increase.

Righteousness shall go before him: and he shall direct his going in the way.

Inclina Domine. Psalm. 86.
Bow down thine ear, Morning prayer.
O Lord, and hear me: for I am poor, and in misery.

Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: my God save thy servant that puts
his trust in thee.

Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I will call daily upon thee.

Comfort the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I list up my
soul.

For thou Lord art good and gracious: and of great mercy unto all them that
call upon thee.

Give ear Lord unto my prayer: and ponder the voice of mine humble desires.

In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou hear me.

Among the good there is none like unto thou, O Lord: there is not one that
can do as thou do.

All nations whom thou have made, shall come and worship thee, O Lord: and
shall glorisie thy name.

For thou art great, and do wondrous things: thou art God alone.

Teach me thy may, O Lord, and I will walk in thy truth: O knit my heart
unto thee, yt I may fear thy name:

I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and will praise thy Name
for evermore.

For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou have delivered my soul from the
nethermost hell.

O God, the proud are risen as against me: and the Congregations of naughty men
have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before their eyes.

But thou (O Lord God) art full of compassion and) mertie: long suffering,
plenteous in goodness and truth.

O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me: give thy strength unto
thy servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.

Show some good token upon me for good, that they which hate me, may see it,
and be ashamed: because thou Lord have helped me, and comforten me.

Fundamentaeius. Psalm. 87.
HEr foundations are upon the holy hills: the Lord loves the gates of Sion,
more then all the dwellings of Jacob.

Very excellent thigs are spoken of thee: thou city of God.

I will think vpou Rahab and Babylon: With them that know me.

Behold ye the Philistims also: and they of Tire, with the Morians, lo, there
was he borne.

And of Sion it shall be reported, that he was borne in her: and the most High
shall stablish her.

The Lord shall rehearse it when he writes up the people: that he was borne
there.

The fingers also and trumpetters shall he rehearse: all my fresh sprmgs shall
be in thee.

Domine Deus. Psalm.88.
O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: O let my
prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear unto my calling.

For my soul is full of trouble: and my life draws nigh unto hell.

I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit: and I have been even
as a man that has no strength.

Free among the dead, like unto them that be wounded and lie in the grave:
which be out of remembrance, and are cut away from thy hand.

Thou have laid me in the lowest pit: in a place of darkness, and in the
deep.

Thine indignation lies hard upon me: and thou have bexed me with all thy
storms.

Thou have put away mine acquaintance far from me: and made me to be
abhorred of them.

I am so fast in prison: that I cannot get forth.

My sight fails for very trouble: Lord, I have called daily upon thee, I have
stretched out mine hands unto thee.

Do thou show wonders among the dead: or shall the dead rise up again and
praise thee?

Shall thy loving kindness be showed in the grave: or thy faithfulness in
destruction?

Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark: and thy righteousness in the
land where all things are forgotten?

Unto thee have I cried, O Lord: and early shall my prayer come before thee.

Lord, why abhorrest thou my soul: and hidest thou thy face from me?

I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die: (even from my
youth up) thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind.

Thy wrathful displeasure goes over me: and the fear of thee has undone me.

They came round about me daily like water: and compassed me together on every
side.

My lovers and friends have thou put away from me: and hid mine acquaintance
out of my sight.

Misericordias Domini. Psalm. 89.
MY song shall be always of the loving kindness of the Lord: with my mouth will
I ever be showing thy truth, Evening prayer.
from one generation to another.

For I have said, Mercy shall be set up for ever: thy truth shall thou stablish
in the heavens.

I have made a covenant with my chosen: I have sworn unto David my servant.

Thy seed will I stablish for ever: and set up thy throne from one generation
to another.

O Lord, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works: and thy truth in
the Congregation of the Saints.

For who is he among the clouds: that shall be compared unto the Lord?

And what is he among the gods: that shall be like unto the Lord?

God is very greatly to be feared in the counsel of the saints: and to be had
in reverence of all them that are about him.

O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee: thy truth (most mighty Lord) is
on every side.

Thou rulest the raging of the sea thou stillest the waves there of when they
arise.

Thou have subdued Egypt, and destroyed it: thou have scattered thine enemies
abroad with thy mighty arm.

The heavens are thine the earth also is thine: thou have laid the foundation
of the round world, and all that therein is.

Thou have made the North and the South: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy
Name.

Thou have a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.

Righteteousnesse and equity is the habitation of the ^eate: mercy and truth
shall go before thy face.

Blessed is the people (O Lord) that can rejoice in thee: they shall walk in
the light of thy countenance.

Their delight shall daily in thy Name: and in thy righteousness shall they
make their boast.

For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy loving kindness thou
shall lift up our horns.

For the Lord is our defense: the holy one of Israel is our King.

Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy Saints, and saydest: I have laid
help upon one that is mighty, I have ixalted one chosen out of the people.

I have found David my servant: with my holy oil have I anointed him.

My hand shall hold him fast: and my arm shall strengthen him.

The enemy shall not be able to do him violence: the son of wickedness
shall not hurt him.

I shall smite down his foes before his face: and plague them that hate him.

My truth also and my mercy shallbe with him: and in my Name shall his horn
be exalted.

I will set his dominion also in the sea: and his right hand in the floods.

He shall call me, Thou art my father: my God, and my strong salvation.

And I will make him my first borne: higher then the kings of the earth.

My mercy will I keep for him for evermore: and my covenant shall stand fast
with him.

His seed also will I make to endure for ever: and his throne as the days of
heaven.

But if his children forsake my Law: and walk not in my judgments.

If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments: I will visit their
offenses with the rod, and their sin with scourges.

Nevertheless, my loving kindness will I not utterly take from him: nor
suffer my truth to fail.

My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my
lips: I have sworn once by my Holiness, that I will not fail David.

His seed shall endure for ever: and his seat is like as the sun before me.

He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon: and as the faithful witness
in heaven.

But thou have abhorred and forsaken thine anointed: and art displeased at him.

Thou have broken the covenant of thy servant: and cast his crown to the
ground.

Thou have overthrown all his hedges: and broken down his strong holds.

All they that go by, spo^^e him: and he is become a rebuke to his neighbors.

Thou have set up the right hand of his enemies: and made all his adversaries
to rejoice.

Thou have taken away the edge of his sword: and give him not victory in
the battle.

Thou have put out his glory: and cast his throne down to the ground.

The days of his youth have thou shortened: and covered him with dishonor.

Lord, how long will thou hide thy self, for ever: and shall thy wrath burn
like fire?

Oh remember how short my time is: wherefore have thou made all men, for naught?

What man is he that lives, and shall not see death: and shall he deliver his
soul from the hand of hell?

Lord, where are thy old loving kindnesses: which thou swarest unto David in
thy truth?

Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have: and how I do bear in my
bosom the rebukes of many people.

Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, and slandered the footesteps of
thine anointed: prased be the Lord for evermore. Amen Amen.

Domine, refugium. Psalm. 90.
Lord, Morning prayer
thou have been our refuge: from one generation to another.

Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world
were made: thou art God from everlasting, and world without end.

Thou rurnest man to destruction: again thou say, Come again ye children
of men.

For a thousand years in thy sight, are but as yesterday: seeing that is past
as a watch in the night.

As soon as thou scatterest them, they are even as a sleep: and fade away
suddenly like the grass.

I^ the morning it is green, and growth up: but in the evening it is cut
down, dried up, and withered.

For we consume away in thy displeasure: and are afraid at thy wrathful
indignation.

Thou have set our misdeedes before thee: and our secret sins in the sight of
thy countenance.

For when thou art angry, all our days are gone: we bring our years to an
end, as it were a tale that is told.

The days of our age are threescore years and ten, and though men be so
strong that they come to fourscore years: yet is their strength then but
labor and sorrow, so soon passes it away, and we are gone.

But who regards the power of thy wrath: for even thereafter as a man fears,
so is thy displeasure.

O teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.

Lurne thee again (O Lord) at the last: and be gracious unto thy servants.

O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: so shall we rejoice and be
glad all the days of our life.

Comfort us again now after the time that thou have plagued us: and for the
years wherein we have suffered adversity.

Show thy servants thy work: and their children thy glory.

And the glorious Majesty of the Lord our God be upon us: prosper thou the
work of our hands upon us, O prosper thou our handy work.

Qui habirat, Psalm. 91.
WHo so dwells under the defense of the most High: shall abide under the
shadow of the Almighty.

I will say unto the Lord, Thou art my hope and my strong hold: my God, in him
will I trust.

For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the Hunter: and from the noisome
pestilence.

He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shall be safe under his
feathers: his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

Thou shall not be afraid for any terror by night. Nor for the arrow that
ftyeth by day.

For the pestilence that walks in darkness: nor for the sickness that
destoyeth in the noone day.

A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but it
shall not come nigh thee.

Yea, with thine eyes shall thou behold: and see the reward of the ungodly.

For thou Lord art my hope: thou have set thine house of defense very high.

There shall no evil happen unto thee: neither shall any plague come nigh thy
dwelling.

For he shall give his angels charge over thee: to keep thee in all thy ways.

They shall bear thee in their hands: that thou hurt not thy foot against a
stone.

Thou shall go upon the Lion and Adder: the young Lion and the Dragon shall thou
tread under thy feet.

Because he has set his love upon me, therefore shall I deliver him: I shall
set him up, because he has known my Name.

He shall call upon me and I will hear him: yea, I am with him in trouble, I
will deliver him, and bring him to honor.

With long life will I satisfy him: and show him my salvation.

Bonum est confiteri, Psalm. 92
IT is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord: and to sing praises unto thy
Name, O most Highest.

To tell of thy loving kindness early in the morning: and of thy truth in the
night season.

Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the Lute: upon a loud
instrument, and upon the Harp.

For thou Lord have made me glad through thy works: and I will rejoice in
giving praise for the operations of thy hands.

O Lord, how glorious are thy works: and thy thoughts are very deep.

An unwise man does not well consider this: and a fool does not understand
it.

When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers of
wickedness do flourish: then shall they be destroyed for ever, but thou Lord art
the most highest for evermore.

For lo, thine enemies (O Lord) lo thine enemies shall perish: and all the
workers of wickedness shall be destroyed.

But my horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn: for I am anointed
with fresh oil.

Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies: and mine ear shall hear his
desire of ye wicked that rise up against me.

The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree: and shall spread abroad like a
Cedar in Libanus.

Such as be planted in the house of the Lord: shall flourish in the courts (of
the house) of our God.

They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age: and shall be fat and well
liking.

That they may show how true the Lord my strength is: and that there is no
unrighteousness in him.

Dominus regnauit. Psalm. 93.
THe Lord is king, Evening prayer
and has put on glorious apparel: the Lord has put on his apparel, and
girded himself with strength.

He has made the round world so sure: that it cannot be moved.

Ever since the world began has thy seat been prepared: thou art from
everlasting.

The floods are risen (O Lord) the floods have lift up their voice: the floods
lift up their waves.

The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly: but yet the Lord that
dwells on high is mightier.

Thy testimonies, O Lord, are very sure: holiness becomes thine house for
ever.

Deus vltionum. Psalm 94.
O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongs: thou God to whom vengeance
belongs, show thy self.

Arise thou judge of the world: and reward the proud after their deserving.

Lord, how long shall the ungodly: how long shall the ungodly triumph?

How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdaincfully: and make such proud
boasting?

They smite down thy people, O Lord: and trouble thine heritage.

They murder the widow and the stranger: and put the fatherless to death.

And yet they say, Tush, the Lord shall not see: neither shall the God of Jacob
regard it.

Take heed ye unwise among the people: O ye fools, when will ye understand?

He that planted the ear, shall he not hear: or he that made the eye, shall
not see?

Or he that nurtureth the heathen: it is he that teaches man knowledge, shall
not he punish?

The Lord knows the thoughts, of man: that they are but vain.

Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest (O Lord:) and teach him in thy Law.

That thou may give him patience in time of aduersitic: until the pit be
dug up for the ungodly.

For the Lord will not fail his people: neither will he forsake his
inheritance.

Until righteousness turn again unto judgment: all such as be true in heart
shall follow it.

Who will rise up with me against the wicked: or who will take my part against
the evil doers?

If the Lord had not helped me: it had not failed but my soul had been put to
silence.

But when I said, my foot has slipped: thy mercy (O Lord) held me up.

In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart: thy comforts have
refreshed my soul.

Will thou have any thing to do with the stool of wickedness: which
imagines mischief as a law?

They gather them together against the soul of the rightteous: and condemn
the innocent blood

But the Lord is my refuge: and my God is the strength of my confidence.

He shall recompense them their wickedness, and destroy them in their own
malice: yea, the Lord our God shall destroy them.

Venite, exultemus. Psalm. 95.
O Come, Morning prayer.
let us sing unto the Lord: let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our
salvation.

Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving: and show our selves glad in
him with Psalms.

For the Lord is a great God: and a great king above all gods.

In his hand are all the corners of the earth: and the strength of the hills
is his also.

The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands prepared the dry land.

O come, let us worship and fall down: and kneel before the Lord our maker.

For he is (the Lord) our God: and we are the people of his pasture, and the
sheep of his hands.

Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: as in the
provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness.

When your fathers tempted me: proved me, and saw my works.

Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: it is a
people that do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways.

Unto whom I swear in my wrath: that they should not enter into my rest.

Cantate Domino. Psalm.96.
O Sing unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord all the whole earth.

Sing unto the Lord, and praise his name: be telling of his salvation from day
to day.

Declare his honor unto the heathen: and his wonders unto all people.

For the Lord is great, and can not worthily be praised: he is more to be
feared then all gods.

As for all the gods of the heathen, they be but idols: but it is the Lord
that made the heavens.

Glory and worship are before him: power and honor are in his sanctuary.

Ascribe unto the Lord (O ye kinreds of the people:) ascribe unto the Lord
worship and power.

Ascribe unto the lord the honor due unto his Name: bring presents, and come
into his courts.

O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: let the whole earth stand in
awe of him.

Tell it out among the heathen, that Lord is king: and that it is he which has
made the round world so fast that it can not be moved, and how that he shall
judge the people righteously.

Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea make a noise,
and all that therein is.

Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it: then shall all the trees of
the wood rejoice before the Lord.

For he comes, for he comes to judge the earth: and with right ousnesse to
judge the world, and the people with his truth.

Dominus regnauit. Psalm. 97.
The Lord is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of the
Isles may be glad thereof.

Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the
habitation of his seat.

There shall go a fire before him: and burn up his enemies on every side.

His lightnings gave shine unto the world: the earth saw it and was afraid.

The hills melted like ware at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of
the Lord of the whole earth.

The heavens declared his righteousness: and all the people have seen his glore.

Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that delight in vain
gods: worship him all ye gods.

Sion heard of it, and rejoiced: and the daughters of Judah were glad, because
of thy judgments, O Lord.

For thou Lord art higher then all that are in the earth: thou art exalted
far above all gods.

O ye that love the Lord, see that ye hate the thing which is cuill: the Lord
preserves the souls of his saints, he shall deliver them from the hand of the
ungodly.

There is sprung up a light for the righteous: and joyful gladness for such
as be true hearted.

Rejoice in the Lord ye righteous: and give thanks for a remembrance of his
holiness.

Cantate Domino. Psalm. 98.
O Sing unto the Lord a new song: Evening prayer.
for he has done marvelous things.

With his owner right hand, and with his holy arm: has he gotten himself the
victory.

The Lord declared his salvation: his righteousness has he openly showed in
the sight of the heathen.

He has remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of Israel: and all
the ends of the world have seen the salvation of our God.

Show your sclues joyful unto the Lord, all ye lands: sing, rejoice, and give
thanks.

Praise the Lord upon the Harp: sing to the Harp with a Psalm of
thanksgiving.

With trumpets also and shaumes: O show your selves joy full before the Lord
the king.

Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is: the round world, and they
that dwell therein.

Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful together before
the Lord: for he is come to judge the earth.

With righteousness shall he judge the world: and the people with equity.

Dominus regnauit. Psalm.99.
The Lord is king, be the people never so impatient: he sits between the
Cherubinis, be the earth never so unquiet.

The Lord is great in Sion: and high above all peopel.

They shall give thanks unto thy name: which is great, wonderful, and holy.

The kings power loves judgment, thou have prepared equity: thou have
executed judgment, and righteousness in Jacob.

O magnify the Lord our God: and fall down before his footestoole, for he is
holy.

Moses and Aaron among his Pricsts, and Samuel among such as call upon his
name: these called upon the Lord, and he heard them.

He spoke unto them out of the cloudie pillar: for they kept his testimonies,
and the law that he gave them.

Thou heardest them (O Lord our God:) thou forgauest them, O God, and
punishedst their own inventions.

O magnify the Lord our God, and worship him upon his holy hill: for the Lord
our God is holy.

Iubilate Deo. Psalm. 100.
O be joyful in the Lord all ye lands: serve the Lord with gladness, and come
before his presence with a song.

Be ye sure that the Lord he is god, it is he that has made us, and not we our
selves: we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.

O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with
praise: be thankful unto him, and speak good of his name.

For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting: and his truth endures
from generation to generation.

Misericordiam and iudicium. Psalm. 101.
MY song shall be of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.

O let me have understanding: in the way of godliness.

When will thou come unto me: I will walk in my house with a perfect heart.

I will take no wicked thing in hand, I hate the sins of unfaithfulness:
there shall no such cleave unto me.

A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.

Who so privily slandereth his neighbor: him will I destroy.

Who so has also a proud look and high stomach: I will not suffer him.

Mine eyes look unto such as be faithful in the land: that they may dwell
with me.

Who so leads a godly life: he shall be my servant.

There shall no deceitful person dwell in my house: he that tells lies shall
not tarif in my sight.

I shall soon destroy all the ungodly that are in the land: that I may root
out all wicked doers from the city of the Lord.

Domine exaudi. Psalm. 102.
Hear my prayer, Morning prayer.
O Lord: and let my crying come unto thee.

Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble: incline thine ears unto
me when I call, O hear me, and that right soon.

For my days are consumed away like smoke: and my bones are burnt up as it
were a firebrand.

My heart is smitten down, and withered like grass: so that I forget to eat
my bread.

For the voice of my groaning: my bones will scarce cleave to my flesh.

I am become like a pelicane in the wilderness: and like an Owl that is in the
desert.

I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow: that sits alone upon the
house top.

Mine enemies revile me all the day long: and they that are mad upon me, are
sworn together against me.

For I have eaten ashes as it were bread: and mingled my drink with weeping.

And that because of thine indignation and wrath: for thou have taken me up,
and cast me down.

My days are gone like a shadow: and I am withered like grass.

But thou (O Lord) shall endure for ever: and thy remembrance thoughout all
generations.

Thou shall arise and have mercy upon Sion: for it is time that thou have
mercy upon her, yea, the time is come.

And why? thy servants think upon her stones: and it pitieth them to see her
in the dust.

The heathen shall fear thy Name, O Lord: and all the kings of the earth thy
maicstie.

When the Lord shall build up Sion: and when his glory shall appear.

When he turns him unto the prayer of the poor destitute: and des^iseth not
their desire.

This shall be written for those that come after: and the people which shall be
borne shall praise the Lord.

For he has looked down from his sanctuary: out of the heaven did the Lord
behold the earth.

That he might hear the mournings of such as be in captivity: and deliver the
children appointed unto death.

That they may declare the name of the Lord in Sion: and his worship at
Jerusalem.

When the people are gathered together: and the kingdoms also serve the Lord.

He brought down my strength in my journey: and shortened my days.

But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age: as for thy
years, they endure throughout all generations.

Thou Lord in the beginning have laid the foundation of the earth: and the
heavens are the work of thy hands.

They shall perish, but thou shall endure: they all shall ware old as does a
garment.

And as a vesture shall thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou
art the same, and thy years shall not fail.

The children of thy servants shall continue: and their seed shall stand fast
in thy sight.

Benedicanima. Psalm. 103.
PRaise the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, praise his holy Name.

Praise the Lord, O my soul: and forget not all his benefits.

Which forgiueth all thy sin: and heals all thine infirmities.

Which saves thy life from destruction: and crowns thee with mercy and
loving kindness.

Which satisfies thy mouth with good things: making thee young and lusty as an
Eagle.

The Lord executes righteousness and judgment: for all them that are
oppressed with wroug.

He showed his ways unto Boses: his works unto the children of Israel.

The Lord is full of compassion and mercy: long suffering and of great
goodness.

He will not always be chiding: neither keeps he his anger for ever.

He has not dealt with us after our sins: nor rewarded us according to our
wickedness.

For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth: so great is his
mercy also toward them that fear him.

Look how wide also the East is from the West: so far has he set our sins
from us.

Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children: even so is the Lord merciful
unto them that fear him.

For he knows whereof we be made: he remembers that we are but dust.

The days of man are but as grass: for he florisheth as a flower of the field.

For as soon as the wind goes over it, it is gone: and the place thereof
shall know it no more.

But the merciful goodness of the Lord endures for ever and ever, upon them
that fear him: and his righteousness upon childrens children.

Even upon such as keep his covenant: and think upon his commandments to do
them.

The Lord has prepared his seat in heaven: and his kingdom rules over all.

O praise the Lord, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength: ye that
fulfill his commandment, and hearken unto the voice of his words.

O praise the Lord all ye his hosts: ye servants of his that do his pleasure.

O speak good of the Lord all ye works of his in all places of his dominion:
Praise thou the Lord, O my soul.

Benedic anima mea. Psalm. 104.
PRaise the Lord, Evening prayer
O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art become exceeding glorious, thou art
clothed with majesty and honor.

Thou deckest thy self with light as it were with a garment: and spreadest out
the heavens like a curtain.

Which lays the beams of his chamber in the waters: and makes the clouds
his charet, and walks upon the wings of the wind.

He makes his angels spirits: and his ministers a flaming fire.

He laid the foundations of the earth: that it never should move at any time.

Thou coueredst it with the, deep like as with a garment: the waters stand in
the hills.

At thy rebuke they flee: at the voice of thy thunder they are afraid.

They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath: even unto
the place which thou have appointed for them.

Thou have set them their bounds, which they shall not pass: neither turn
again to cover the earth.

He sends the springs into the rivers: which run among the hills.

All beasts of the field drink thereof: and the wild Asses quench their
thirst.

Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation: and sing among
the branches.

He waters the hills from above: the earth is filled with the fruit of thy
works.

He brings forth grass for the cattle: and green herb for the service of
men.

That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that makes glad the heart
of man: and oil to make him a cherefull countenance, and bread to strengthen
man's heart.

The trees of the Lord also are full of sap: even the Cedars of Libanus, which
he has planted.

Wherein the birds make their nestes: and the Fur trees are a dwelling for
the Storke.

The high hills are a refuge for the wild Goats: and so are the stony
rocks for the Conies.

He appointed the Moon for certain seasons: and the Sun knows his going
down.

Thou make darkness, that it may be night: wherein all the beasts of the
forest do move.

The Lions roaring after their pray: do seek their meat at God.

The sun arises, and they get them away together: and lay them down in
their dens.

Man goes forth to his work, and to his labor: until the evening.

O Lord, how manifold are thy works: in wisdom have thou made them all, the
earth is full of thy riches.

So is the great and wide sea also: wherein are things creeping innumerable,
both small and great beasts.

There go the ships, and there is that Liuiathan: whom thou have made to take
his passime therein.

These wait all upon thee: that thou may give them meat in due season.

When thou give it them, they gather it: and when thou openest thy hand, they
are filled with good.

When thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: When thou take away their
breath, they die, and are turned again to their dust.

When thou let thy breath go forth, they shall be made: and thou shall
renew the face of the earth.

The glorious Majesty of the Lord shall endure forever: the Lord shall rejoice
in his works.

The earth shall tremble at the look of him: if he do but touch the hills,
they shall smoke.

I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will praise my God, while I
have my being.

And so shall my words please him: my joy shall be in ye Lord.

As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, and the ungodly shall
come to an end: praise thou the Lord, O my soul, praise the Lord.

Confitemini Domino. Psalm. 105.
O Give thanks unto the Lord, Morning prayer
and call upon his name: tell the people what things he has done.

O let your songs be of him, and praise him: and let your talking be of all his
wondrous works.

Rejoice in his holy Name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.

Seek the Lord and his strength: seek his face evermore.

Remember the marvelous works that he has done: his wonders and the
indgements of his mouth.

O ye seed of Abraham his servant: ye children of Jacob his chosen.

He is the Lord our God: his judgments are in all the world.

He has been always mindful of his covenant and promise: that he made to a
thousand generations.

Even the covenant that he made with Abraham: and the other that he swear unto
Isahac.

And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law: and to Israel for an everlasting
testament.

Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Chanaan: the lot of your inheritance.

When there were yet but a few of them: and they strangers in the land.

What time as they went from one nation to another: from one kingdom to
another people.

He suffered no man to do them wrong: but reproved even kings for their sakes.

Touch not mine anointed: and do my Prophets no harm.

Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land: and destroyed all the
provision of bread.

But he had sent a man before them: even Joseph which was sold to be a bond
servant.

Whose feet they hurt in the stocks: the iron entered into his soul.

Until the time came that his cause was known: the word of the Lord tried him.

The king sent and delivered him: the prince of the people let him go free.

He made him lord also of his house: and ruler of all his substance.

That he might inform his princes after his will: and teach his Senators
wisdom.

Israel also came into Egypt: and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.

And he increased his people exceedingly: and made them stronger then their
enemies.

Whose heart turned, so that they hated his people: and dealt untruly with his
servants.

Then sent he Moses his servant: and Aaron whom he had chosen.

And these showed his tokens among them: and wonders in the land of ham.

He sent darkness, and it was dark: and they were not obedient unto his word.

He turned their waters into blood: and slew their fish.

Their land brought forth frogs: yea, even in their kings chambers.

He spoke the word, and there came all manner of flies: and lite in all their
quarters.

He gave them hailestones for rain: and flames of fire in their land.

He smote their vines also and fig trees: and destroyed the trees that were
in their coasts.

He spoke the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars innumerable:
and did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of their
ground.

He smote all the first borne in their land: even the chief of all their
strength.

He brought them forth also with silver and gold there was not one feeble
person among their tribes.

Egypt was glad at their departing: for they were afraid of them.

He spread out a cloud to be a covering: and fire to give light in the night
season.

At their desire he brought quails: and he filled them with the bread of
heaven.

He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out: so that rivers ran in
dry places.

For why? he remembered his holy promise: and Abraham his servant.

And he brought forth his people with joy: and his chosen with gladness.

And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they took the labors of the
people in possession.

That they might keep his statutes: and observe his laws.

Confitemini Domino, Psalm. 106.
O Give thanks unto the Lord, Evening Prayer
for he is gracious: and his mercy endures for ever.

Who can express the noble acts of the Lord: or show forth all his praise?

Blessed are they that always keep judgment: and do righteousness.

Remember me, O Lord, according to the favor that thou bear unto thy
people: O visit me with thy salvation.

That I may see the felicity of thy chosen: and rejoice in the gladness of thy
people, and give thanks with thine inheritance.

We have sinned with our fathers: we have done amiss, and dealt wickedly.

Our fathers regarded not thy woonders in Egypt, neither kept they thy great
goodness in remembrance: but were disobedient at the sea, even at the red sea.

Nevertheless, he helped them, for his names sake: that he might make his
power to be known.

He rebuked the red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the
deep, as through a wilderness.

And he saved them from the adversaries hand: and delivered them from the hand
of the enemy.

As for those that troubled them, the waters oucrwhelmed them: there was not
one of them left.

Then believed they his words: and sang praise unto him.

But within a while they forgot his works; and would not abide his counsel.

But lust came upon them in the wilderness: and they tempted God in the desert.

And he gave them their desire: and sent leanncsse withal into their soul.

They angered Moses also in the tents: and Aaron the Saint of the Lord.

So the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the congregation of
Abiram.

And the fire was kindled in their company: the flame burnt up the ungodly.

They made a calfe in Horeb: and worshipped the molten image.

Thus they turned their glory: into the similitude of a calf^ that eats hay.

And they forgate God their Savior: which had done so great things in Egypt.

Wondrous works in the land of Ham: and fearful things by the red sea.

So he said he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stand
before him in the gap: to turn away his wrathful indignation, lest he should
destroy them.

Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land: and gave no credence unto his
word.

But murmured in their tents: and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord.

Then lift he up his hand against them: to overthrow them in the wilderness

To cast out their seed among the nations: and to scatter them in the lands.

They joined themselves unto Baal Peor: and ate the offerings of the dead.

Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions: and the plague was
great among them.

Then stood up Phinees, and prayed: and so the plague ceased.

And that was counted unto him for righteousness: among all posterities for
evermore.

They angered him also at the waters of strife: so that he punished Moses for
their sakes.

Because they provoked his spirit: so that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips.

Neither destroyed they the heathen: as the Lord commanded them.

But were mingled among the heathen: and learned their works.

In so much that they worshipped their idols, which turned to their own decay:
yea, they offered their sons and daughters unto devils.

And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their
daughters: whom they offered unto the woles of Chanaan, and the land was
defiled with blood.

Thus were they stained with their own works: and went a whoring with their
own inventions.

Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people: in so much
that he abhorred his own inheritance.

And he gave them over into the hand of the heathen: and they that hated them
were lords over them.

Their enemies oppressed them: and had them in subjection.

Many a time did he deliver them: but they rebelled against him with their own
inventions, and were brought down in their wickedness.

Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity: he heard their complaint.

He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them according unto the multitude of
his mercies: yea, he made all those that led them away captive to pity them.

Deliver: us (O Lord our God) and gather us from among the heathen: that we may
give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our boast of thy praise.

Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, from everlasting, and world without end:
and let all the people say, Amen.

Confitemini Domino. Psalm. 107.
O Give thanks unto the Lord, Morning prayer
for he is gracious: and his mercy endures for ever.

Let them give thanks whom the Lord has redeemed: and delivered from the hand
of the enemy.

And gathered them out of the lands, from the East and from the West: from the
North and from the South.

They went astray in the wilderness out of the way: and found no city to
dwell in.

Hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.

So they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: and he delivered them from their
distress.

He led them forth by the right way: that they might go to the city where
they dwelt.

O that men would therefore praise ye Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he does for the children of men.

For he satisfies the empty soul: and fills the hungry soul with
goodness.

Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death: being fast bound in
misery and iron.

Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord: and lightly regarded the
counsel of the most high.

He also brought down their heart through heaviness: they fell down, and
there was none to help them up.

So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of
their distress.

For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow of death: and
brake their bonds in sunder.

O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he does for the children of men.

For he has broken the gates of brass: and smitten the bars of iron in
sunder.

Foolish men are plagued for their offense: and because of their wickedness.

Their soul abhors all manner of meat: and they were even hard at deaths
door.

So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of
their distress

He sent his word and healed them: and they were saved from their destruction.

O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he does for the children of men.

That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving: and tell out
his works with gladness.

They that go down to the sea in ships: and occupy their business in great
waters.

These men see the works of the Lord: and his wonders in the deep.

For at his word the stormy wind arises: which lifts up the waves thereof.

They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep: their soul
melts away because of the trouble.

They reele to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man: and are at their wits
end.

So when they cry unto the Lord in their trouble: he deliue^th them out of
their distress

For he makes the storm to cease: so that the waves thereof are still.

Then are they glad, because they be at rest: and so he brings them unto the
haven where they would be.

O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he does for the children of men.

Th^^ they would exa^ him also in the Congregation of the people: and praise
him in the seat of the elders.

Which turns the floods into a wilderness: and dries up the water springs.

A fruitful land makes he barren: for the wickedness of them that dwell
therein.

Again he makes the wilderness a standing water: and water springs of a dry
ground.

And there he sets the hungry: that they may build them a city to dwell in.

That they may sow their land, and plant vineyardes: to yield them fruits of
increase.

He blesses them, so that that they multiply exceedingly: and suffers not
their cattle to decrease.

And again, when they are minished and brought low: through oppression,
through any plague or trouble.

Though he suffer them to be evil entreated through tyrants: and let them
wander out of the way in the wilderness.

Yet helps he the poor out of misery: and makes him households like a
flock of sheep.

The righteous will consider this, and rejoice: and the mouth of all
wickedness shall be stopped.

Who so is wise, will ponder these things: and they shall understand the loving
kindness of the Lord.

Paratum cormeum. Psalm. 108.
O God, Evening prayer
my heart is ready (my heart is ready:) I will sing and give praise with the
best member that I have.

Awake thou Lute and Harp: I my (...) will awake right early.

I will give thanks unto thee O Lord, among the people: I will sing praises
unto thee among the nations.

For thy mercy is greater then the hea^^ns: and thy truth reaches unto the
clouds.

Set up thy self (O God) above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.

That thy beloved may be delivered: let thy right hand save them, and hear
thou me.

God has spoken in his holiness: I will rejoice therefore and divide Sichem,
and mete out the valley of Sucoth.

Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head.

Judah is my lawgiuer, Moab is my washpot: over Edom will I cast out my shoe,
upon the Philistims will I triumph.

Who will lead me into the strong city: and who will bring me into Edom?

Have not thou forsaken us, O God: and wilt not thou God go forth with our
hosts?

O help us against ye enemy: for vain is the help of man.

Through God we shall do great acts: and it is he that shall tread down our
enemies.

Deus laudem. psalm. 109.
HOld not thy tongue, O God of my praise: for the mouth of the ungodly, yea,
and the mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.

And they have spoken against me with false tongues: they compassed me about
also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.

For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my contrary part: but I
give my self unto prayer.

Thus have they rewarded me evil for good: and hatred for my good will.

Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him: and let Satan stand at his
right hand.

When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned: and let his prayer be
turned into sin.

Let his days be few: and let another take his office.

Let his children be fatherless: and his wife a widow.

Let his children be vagabonds, and beg their bread: let them seek it also
out of desolate places.

Let the extortioner consume all that he has: and let the stranger spoil his
labor.

Let there be no man to pity him: nor to have compassion upon his fatherless
children.

Let his posterity be destroyed: and in the next generation let his name be
clean put out.

Let the wickedness of his fathers be hab in remembrance in the sight of the
Lord: and let not the sin of his mother be done away.

Let them always be before the Lord: that he may root out the memorial of them
from of the earth.

And that because his mind was not to do good: but persecuted the poor
helpelesse man, that he might slay him that was vexed at the heart.

His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him: he loved not
blessing, therefore shall it be far from him.

He clothed himself with cursing like as with a raiment: and it shall come
into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.

Let it be unto him as the cloak that he has upon him: and as the girdle that
he is always girded withal.

Let it thus happen from the Lord unto mine enemies: and to those that speak
evil against my soul.

But deal thou with me, O Lord God, according unto thy Name: for sweet is thy
mercy.

O deliver me, for I am helpelesse and poor: and my heart is wounded within me.

I go hence like the shadow that departs: and am driven away as the
grasshopper.

My knees are weak through fasting: my flesh is dried up for want of fatness.

I became also a rebuke unto them: they that looked upon me, shaked their heads.

Help me, O Lord my God: oh save me according to thy mercy.

And they shall know how that this is thy hand: and that thou Lord have done it.

Though they curse, yet bless thou: and let them be confounded that rise up
against me, but let thy servant rejoice.

Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame: and let them cover themselves with
their own confusion, as with a cloak.

As for me, I will give great thanks unto the Lord with my mouth: and praise
him among the multitude.

For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor: to save his soul from
unrighteous Judges.

Dixit Dominus. psalm 110.
THE Lord said unto my Lord: Morning Prayer.
sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footestoole.

The Lord shall send the rod of thy power out of Sion: be thou ruler even in
the mids among thine enemies.

In the day of thy power shall the people offer thee free will offerings with
an holy worship: the dew of thy birth is of the womb of the morning.

The Lord swear, and will not repent: thou art a Priest for ever, after the
order of Meichisedech.

The Lord upon thy right hand: shall wound even Kings in the day of his wrath.

He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead
bodies: and smite in sunder the heads over diverse countries.

He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he Lift up his head.

Confitebor tibi. Psalm. 111.
I Will give thanks unto the Lord with my whole heart: secretly among the
faithful, and in the Congregation.

The works of the Lord are great: sought out of all them that have pleasure
therein.

His work is worthy to be praised and had in honor: and his righteousness
endures for ever.

The merciful and gracious Lord has so done his marrucilous works: that they
ought to be had in remembrance.

He has given meat unto them that fear him: he shall ever be mindful of
his covenant.

He has showed his people the power of his works: that he may give them the
heritage of the heathen.

The works of his hands are verity and judgment: all his commandments are
true.

They stand fast for ever and ever: and are done in truth and equity.

He sent redemption unto his people: he has commanded his covenant for ever,
holy and reverent is his Name.

The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have
all they that do thereafter, the praise of it endures for ever.

Beatus vir. Psalm. 112.
BLessed is the man that fears the Lord: he has great delight in his
conmandements.

His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the faithful shall be
blessed.

Riches and plenteousnes shall be in his house: and his righteousness endures
for ever.

Unto the godly there arises up light in the darkness: he is merciful,
loving, and righteous.

A good man is merciful, and lends: and will guide his words with discretion.

For he shall never be moved: and the righteous shall be had in an everlasting
remembrance.

He will not be afraid for any evil tidings: for his heart stands fast,
and believes in the Lord.

His heart is stablished and will not shrink: until he see his desire upon
his enemies.

He has dispersed abroad, and given to the poor: and his righteousness
remains for ever, his horn shall be exalted with honor.

The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him: he shall gnash with his
teeth, and consume away, the desire of the ungodly shall perish.

Laudate pueri. Psalm. 113.
Praise the Lord, ye servants: O praise the name of the Lord.

Blessed be the name of the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.

The Lords Name is praised: from the rising up of the Snune, unto the going
down of the same.

The Lord is high above all heathen: and his glory above the heavens.

Who is like unto the Lord out God, that has his dwelling so high: and yet
humbles himself to behold the things that are in heaven and earth?

He takes up the simple out of the dust: and lifts poor out of the mire.

That he may set him with the princes: even with the princes of his people.

He makes the barren woman to keep house: and to be a joyful mother of
children.

In exitu Israel. Psalm. 114.
WHen Israel came out of Egypt: Evening preyer.
and the house of Jacob from among the strange people.

Judah was his sancutuarie: and Israel his dominion.

The sea saw that, and fled: Jordan was driven back.

The mountains skipped like Rams: and the little hills like young sheep.

What a^eth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest: and thou Jorden, that thou
wast driven back?

Ye mountains that ye skipped like Rams: and ye little hills like young sheep?

Tremble thou earth at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the God of
Jacob.

Which turned the hard rock into a standing water: and the flint stone into a
springing well.

Non nobis Domine. Psalm.115.
NOt unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give the praise: for thy
loving mercy, and for thy trueths sake.

Wherefore shall the heathen say: where is now their God?

As for our God, he is in heaven: he has done whatsoever pleased him.

Their idols are silver and gold: even ye work of men's hands.

They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, and see not.

They have ears, and hear not: noses have they, and smell not.

They have hands, and handle not, feet have they, and walk not: neither
speak they through their throat.

They that make them, are like unto them: and so are all such as put their
trust in them.

But thou house of Israel trust thou in the Lord: he is their succor and
defense.

Ye house of Aaron, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.

Ye that fear the Lord, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and
defender.

The Lord has been mindful of us, and he shall bless us: eurn he shall
bless the house of Israel, he shall bless the house of Aaron.

He shall bless them that fear the Lord: both small and great.

The Lord shall increase you more and more: you and your children.

Ye are the blessed of ye Lord: which made heaven and earth.

All the whole heavens are the Lords: the earth has he given to the children
of men.

The dead praise not thee, O Lord: neither all they that got down into the
silence.

But we will praise the Lord: from this time forth for evermore. Praise the
Lord.

Dilexi quoniam. Psalm. 116.
I Am well pleased: Morning prayer.
that the Lord has heard the voice of my prayer.

That he has inclined his ear unto me: therefore will I call vpou him as
long as I live.

The snares of death compassed me round about: and the pains of hell gate hold
upon me.

I shall find trouble and heaviness, and I shall call upon the name of the
Lord: O Lord I beseech thee deliver my soul.

Gracious is the Lord and righteous: yea one God is merciful.

The Lord preserves the simple: I was in misery, and he helped me.

Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul: for the Lord has rewarded thee.

And why? thiu have delivered my soul from death: mine eyes from tears, and
my feet from falling.

I will walk before the Lord: in the land of the living.

I believed, and therefore will I speak, but I was fore troubled: I said in my
haste, All men are liars.

What reward shall I give unto the Lord: for all the benefits that he has
done unto me?

I will receive the cup of salvation: and call upon the name of the Lord.

I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people: right dear in the
sight of the Lord, is the death of his Saints.

Behold (O Lord) how that I am thy servant: I am thy servant, and the son of
thine handmaid, thou have broken my bonds in sunder.

I will offer to thee the sarrifice of thanksgiving: and will call upon the
Name of the Lord.

I will pay my vows unto the Lord, in the fight of all his people: in the
courts of the Lords house, even in the mids of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise the
Lord.

O Praise the Lord all ye heathen: praise him all ye nations.

the Lord endures for ever. Praise the Lord.

Confitemini Domino. Psalm.118.
O Give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracions: because his mercy endures
for ever.

Let Israel now confess, that he is gracious: and that his mercy endures for
ever.

Let the house of Aaron now confess: that his mercy endures for ever.

Yea, let them now that fear the Lord, confess: that his mercy endures for
ever.

I called vpou the Lord in trouble: and the Lord heard me at large.

The Lord is on my side: I will not fear what man does unto me.

The Lord takes my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my
desire upon mine enemies.

It is better to trust in the Lord: then to put any confidence in man.

It is better to trust in the Lord: then to put any confidence in Princes.

All nations compassed me round about: but in the name of the Lord will I
destroy them.

They kept me in on eueryside, they kept me in (I say) on every side: but in
the name of the Lord will I destroy them.

They came about me like Bees, and are extinct even as the fire among the
thorns: for in the name of the Lord will I destroy them.

Thou have thrust sore at me, that I might fall: but the Lord was my help.

The Lord is my strength and my song: and is become my salvation.

The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous: the right
hand of the Lord brings mighty things to pass.

The right hand of the Lord has the preeminence: the right hand of the Lord
brings mighty things to pass.

I will not die, but live: and declare the works of the Lord.

The Lord has chastend and corrected me: but he has not given me over unto
death.

Open me the gates of righteousness: that I may go into them, and give
thanks unto the Lord.

This is ye gate of the Lord: the rightteous shall enter into it.

I mil thank thee, for thou have heard me: and art become my salvation.

The same stone which the builders refused: is become the head ston in the
corner.

This is the Lords doing: and it is marvelous in out eyes.

This is the day which the Lord has made: we will rejoice and be glad in it.

Help me now, O Lord: O Lord send us now prosperity.

Blessed be he that comes in the name of the Lord: we have wished you good
luck, ye that be of ye house of the Lord.

God is the Lord which has showed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords,
yea, even unto the horns of the altar.

Thou art my God, and I will thank thee: thou art my God, and I will praise
thee.

O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endures for
ever.

Beati imaculati. Psalm. 119.

ashamed.

And my delight shall be in thy commandments: which I have loved.

My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved: and
my study shall be in thy statutes.

me to put my trust.

The same is my comfort in my trouble: for thy word has quickened me.

The proud have had me exceedingly in derision: yet have I not shrinked from

For I remembered thine everlasting judgments, O Lord: and received comfort.

I am horribly afraid: for the ungodly that forsake thy law.

The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy: O tearh me thy statutes.

Bonitatem fecisti.

Therefore hold I stright all thy commandemebts: and all self ways I utterly
abhor.

Mirabilia.

Mine eyes prevent the night watches:that I might be occupied in thy words.

Hear my voice (O Lord) according unto thy loving kindness: quitken me
according as thou art eont.

grounded them for ever.

Ad Dominum. Psalm. 120.
When I was in trouble, Morning prayer.
I called upon the Lord: and he heard me.

Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips: and from a deceitful tongue.

What reward shall be given or done unto thee thou false tongue: even mighty
and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.

Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Mesech: and to have mine
habitation among the tents of Cedar.

My soul has long dwelt among them: that be enemies unto pear.

I labor for pear, but when I speak unto them thereof: they make them ready
to battle.

Leuaui oculos. Psalm. 121.
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills: from whence comes my help.

My help comes even from the Lord: which has made heaven and earth.

He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: and he that keeps thee, will not
sleep.

Behold, he that keeps Israel: shall neithet slumber nor sleep.

The Lord himself is thy keeper: the Lord is thy defense upon thy right hand.

So that the sun shall not burn the by day: neither the moon by night.

The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: yea, it is even he that shall
keep thy soul.

The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in: from this time
forth for evermore.

Laetatus sum. Psalm, 122.
I was glad when they said vuto me: We will go into the house of the Lord.

Our seete shall stand in thy gates: O Jerusalem.

Jerusalem is builded as a city: that is at unity in it self.

For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord: to testify unto
Israel, to give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.

For there is the seat of judgment: even the seat of the house of David.

O pray for the peate of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.

Peace be within thy walls: and plentconsuesse within thy palaces.

For my brethren and companions sakes: I will with thee prosperity.

Yea, because of the house of the Lord our God: I will seek to do thee good.

Ad te leuaui oculos meos. Psalm. 123.
Unto thee lift I up mine eyes: O thou that dwell in the heavens.

Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters,
and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress: even so our eyes
wait upon the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us.

Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we are utterly despised.

Our soul is filled with the scornefnll reproof of the wealthy: and with the
dispitefulnesse of the proud.

Nisi quia Dominus. Psalm. 124.
IF the Lord himself had not been on our side (now may Israel say:) if the
Lord himself had not been on one side when men rose up against us.

They had swallowed us up quick: when they were so wrathfully displeased at us.

Yea, the waters had drowned us: and the stream had gone over our soul.

The deep waters of the proud: had gone even over our soul.

But praised be the Lord: which has not given us over for a pray unto their
teeth.

Our soul is escaped, even as a bird out of the snare of the fouler: the snare
is broken, and we are delivered.

Our help stands in the Name of the Lord: which has made heaven and earth.

Qui confidunt. Psalm. 125.
They that put their trust in the Lord, shall be even as the mount Sion: which
may not be removed, but stands fast for ever.

The his stand about Jerusalem: even so stands the Lord round about his
people, from this time forth for evermore.

For the rod of the ungodly comes not into the lot of the righteous: least
the righteous put their hand unto wickedness.

Do well, O Lord: unto those that be good and true of heart.

As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness: the Lord shall lead
them forth with the evil doers, but peace shall be upon Israel.

In conuertendo. Psalm. 126.
WHen the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion: Evening prayer.
then were we like unto them that dsreame.

Then was our mouth filled with laughter: and our tongue with joy.

Then said they among the Heathen: the Lord has done great things for them.

Yea, the Lord has done great things for us already: whereof we rejoice.

Turn our captivity, O Lord: as the rivers in the South.

They that sow in tears: shall reap in joy.

He that now goes on his way weeping, and bears forth good seed: shall
doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaues with him.

Nisi Dominus. Psalm. 127.
Except the Lord build the house: their labor is but lost that build it.

Except the Lord keep the city: the watchman waketh but in baine.

It is but lost labor that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take rest,
and eat the bread of carfulness: for so he gives his beloved sleep.

Lo, children and the fruit of the womb: are an heritage and gift that
comes of the Lord.

Like as the arrows in the hand of the Giant: even so are the young children.

Happy is the man that has his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed
when they speak with their enemies in the gate.

Beati omnes. Psalm. 128.
BLessed are all they that fear the Lord: and walk in his ways.

For thou shall eat the labors of thine hands: O well is thee, and happy
shall thou be.

Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine: upon the walls of thine house.

Thy children like the Olive branches: round about thy table.

Lo, thus shall the man be blessed: that fears the Lord.

The Lord from out of Sion shall so bless thee: that thou shall see Jerusalem
in prosperity all thy life long Yea, that thou shall see thy childrens
children: and peace upon Israel.

Saepe expugnauerunt. psalm. 129.
MAny a time have they fought against me from my youth up; (may Israel now
say.)

Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up: but they have not
prevailed against me.

The plowers plowed upon my back: and made long furrows.

But the righteous Lord: has hewn the snares of the ungodly in pieces.

Let them be confounded and turned backward: as many as have evil will at Sion.

Let them be even as the grass growing upon the house tops: Which Withers
before it be plucked up.

Where of the mower fills not his hand: neither he that binds up the
sheaues, his bosom.

So that they Which go by, say not so much as ye Lord prosper you: We Wish you
good luck in the name of the Lord.

De profundis. Psalm. 130.
OUt of the deep have I called unto thee, (O Lord:) Lord hear my voice.

Oh let thine eyes consider well: the voice of my complaint.

If thou Lord wilt beeextreme to mark what is done amiss: O Lord, Who may
abide it.

For there is mercy With thee: theefore shall thou be feared.

I look for the Lord, my soul does wait for him: in his word is my trust.

My soul flees unto the Lord: before the morning watch, I say, before the
morning watch.

O Israel trust in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy: and with him is
plenteous redemption.

And he shall redeem Israel: from all his sins.

Domine, non est. psalm. 131
LOrd, I am not high minded: I have no proud looks.

I do note exercise my self in great matters: which are too high for me.

But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned
from his mother: yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.

O Israel trust in the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.

Memento Domine. Psalm. 132.
Lord remember David: Morning prayer.
and all his trouble.

How he swear unto the Lord: and bowed a bow unto the Almighty God of Jacob.

I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house: nor clime up into my bed.

I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eye liddes to slumber: neither
the temples of my head to take any rest.

Until I find out a place for the temple of the Lord: an habitation for the
mighty God of Jacob.

Lo we heard of the same at Ephrata: and found it in the wood.

We will go into his tabenacle: and follow on our knees before his foot
stool.

Arise, O Lord, into thy resting place: thou and the arc of thy strength.

Let thy Priests be clothed with righteousness: and let thy Saints sing with
joy fullness.

For thy servant David's sake: turn not away the presence of thine anointed.

The Lord has made a faithful oath unto David: and he shall not shrink from
it.

Of the fruit of thy body: shall I set upon thy seat.

If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that I shall learn
them: their children also shall sit upon thy seat for evermore.

For the Lord has chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself: he has
longed for her.

This shall be my rest for ever: here will I dwell, for I have a delight
therein.

I will bless her vitailes with increase: and will satisfy her poor with
bread.

I will deck her Priests with healthy: and her saints shall rejoice and sing.

There shall I make the horn of David to flourish: I have ordained a lantern
for mine anointed.

As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame: but upon himself shall
his crown flourish.

Ecce quam bonum. Psalm. 133.
BEhold how good and joyful a thing it is: brethren to dwell together in unity.

It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down unto the
beard: even unto Aarons beard, and went down to the skirtes of his clothing.

Like as the dew of Hermon: which fell upon the hill of Sion.

For three the Lord promised his blessing: and life for cuermore.

Ecce nunc. Psalm. 134.
Behold (now) praise the Lord: all ye servants of the Lord

Ye that by night stand in the house of the Lord: even in the courts of the
house of our God.

Lift up your hands in the sanctuary: and praise the Lord.

The Lord that made heaven and earth: give thee blessing out of Sion.

Laudate nomen. Psalm. 135.
O Praise the Lord, laud ye the Name of the Lord: praise it, O ye servants of
the Lord.

Ye that stand in the house of the Lord: in the courts of the house of our God.

O praise the Lord, for the Lord is gracious: O sing praises unto his Name, for
it is lovely.

For why? the Lord has chosen Jacob unto himself: and Israel for his own
prossession.

For I know that the Lord is great: and that our Lord is above all gods.

Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven and in earth: and in the
sea, and in all deep places.

He brings forth the clouds from the ends of the world: and sends forth
lightenings with the rain, bringing the winds out of his treasures.

He smote the first borne of Egypt: both of man and beast.

He has sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou land of
Egypt: upon Pharao and all his servants.

He smote diverse nations: and flew mighty kings.

Sehon king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Basan: and all the kingdoms of
Chanaan.

And gave their land to be an heritage: even an heritage unto Israel his
people.

Thy Name, O Lord, endures for ever: does thy memorial, O Lord, from one
generation to another.

For the Lord will avenge his people: and be gracious unto his servants.

As for the images of the heathen, they are but silver and gold: the work of
men's hands.

They have mouths and speak not: eyes have they, but they see not.

They have ears, and yet they hear not: neither is there any breath in their
mouths.

They that make them, are like unto them: and so are all they that put their
trust in them.

Praise the Lord ye house of Israel: praise the Lord ye house of Aaron.

Praise the Lord ye house of Leui: ye that fear the Lord, praise the Lord.

Praised be the Lord out of Sion: which dwells at Jerusalem.

Confitemini. Psalm. 136.
O Give thanks unto the Lord, Evening prayer.
for he is gracious: and his mercy endures for ever.

O give thanks unto the God of all gods: for his mercy endures for ever.

O thank the Lord of all lords: for his mercy endures for ever.

Which only does great woonders: for his mercy endures for ever.

Which by his excellent wisdom made the heauenens: for his mercy endures for
ever.

Which laid out the earthy above the waters: for his mercy endures for ever.

Which has made great lights: for his mercy endures for ever.

The moon and the stars to govern the night: for his mercy endures for
ever.

Which sinote Egypt with their first borne: for his mercy endures for ever.

And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endures for ever.

With a mighty hand and a stretched out arm: for his mercy endures for ever.

Which divided the red Sea in two parts: for his mercy endures for ever.

And made Israel to go through the midst of it: for his mercy endures for
ever.

But as for Pharao and his host, he overthrewe them in the red sea: for his
mercy endures for ever.

Which led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endures for
ever.

Which sinote great Kings: for his mercy endures for ever.

Yea, and slew mighty Kings: for his mercy endures for ever.

Sehon King of the Amorities: for his mercy endures for ever.

And Og the King of Basan: for his mercy endures for ever.

And gave away their land for an heritage: for his mercy endures for ever.

Even for an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endures for ever.

Which remembered us when we were in trouble: for his mercy endures for ever.

And has delivered us from our enemies: for his mercy endures for ever.

Which giucth food to all flesh: for his mercy endures for ever.

O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endures for ever.

O give thanks unto the Lord of lords: for his mercy endures for ever.

Super flumina. Psalm. 137.
By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept: when we remembered (thee) O
Sion.

As for our harpes, we hanged them up: upon the trees that are therein.

For they that; led us away captive, required of us then a song and melody
in our heaviness: sing us one of the songs of Sion.

How shall we sing the Lords song: in a strange land?

If I forget thee, O Jerusalem: let my right hand forget her cunning.

If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to ye roof of my mouth: yea,
if I prferre not Jerusalem in my mirth.

Remember the children of Edom, O Lord, in the day of Jerusalem: how they
said, Down with it, down with it, even to the ground.

O daughter of Babylon, wasted with misery: yea, happy shall he be that
rewards thee as thou have served us.

Blessed shall he be that takes thy children: and throws them against the
stones.

Confitebor tibi. Psalm. 138.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: even before the gods
will I sing praise unto thee.

I will worship toward thy holy Temple, and praise thy Name, because of thy
loving kindness and truth: for thou have magnified thy Name, and thy word
above all things.

When I called upon thee, thou heardest me: and enduedst my soul with much
strength.

All the Kings of the earth shall praise thce, O Lord: for they have heard the
words of thy mouth.

Yea, they shall sing the ways of the Lord: that great is the glory of the
Lord.

For though the Lord be high, yet has he respect unto the lowly: as for the
proud, he beholds them a far off.

Though I walk in the midst to trouble, yet shall thou refresh me: thou
shall stretch forth thine hand upon the furiousness of mine enemies, and thy
right hand shall save me.

The Lord shall make good his loving kindness toward me: yea thy mercy, O
Lord, eudureth for ever despise not then works of thine own hands.

Domine probasti. psalm. 139
O Lord, Morning prayer
thou have searched me out, and known me: thou know my down sitting, and
mine vprising, thou understand my thoughts long before.

Thou art about my path, and about my bed: and spiest out al my ways.

For lo, there is not a word in my toungue: but thon, O Lord, know it
altogether.

Thou have fashioned me behind and before: and laid thine hand upon me.

Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me: I cannot attain unto
it.

Whither shall I go then from thy spirit: or whither shall I go then from thy
presence?

If I clime up into heaven, thou art there: If go down in hell, thou art there
also.

If I take the wings of the morning: and remain in the uttermost parts of the
sea.

Even there also shall thy hand lead me: and thy right hand shall hold me.

If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me: then shall my night be
turned to day.

Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as clear as
the day: the darkness and light (to thee) are both alike.

For my reins are thine: thou have covered me in my mothers womb.

I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
marvelous are thy works, and that my soul knows right well.

My bones are not hid from thee: though I be made secretly, and fashioned
beneath in the earth.

Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect: and in thy book were
all my members written which day by day were fashioned: when as yet there was
none of them.

How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God: O how great is the sumine of them?

If I tell them, they are more in number then the sand: when I wake up, I am
present with thee.

Will thou not slay the wicked, O God: Depart from me, ye bloodthirstie men.

For they speak unrighteously against thee: and thine enemies take thy name in
vain.

Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee: and am not I grieved with those
that rise up against thee?

Yea, I hate them right fore: even as though they were mine enemies.

Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart: prove me, and examine my
thoughts.

Look well if there be any may of wickedness in me: and lead me the may
everlasting.

Eripe me Domine. Psalm. 140.
Deliver me O Lord from the evil man: and preserve me from the wicked man.

Which imagine mischief in their hearts: and stir up strife all the day long.

They have sharpened their tongues like a Serpent: Adders poison is under their
lips.

Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the ungodly: Preserve me from the
wicked men, which are purposed to overthrow my goings.

The proud have laid a fanare for me, and spread a net aborad with cords: yea,
and set traps in my way.

I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: hear the boyce of my prayers, O Lord.

O Lord God, Tbou strength of my health: thou have covered my head in the day
of battle.

Let not the ungodly have his desire, O Lord: let not his mischicuous
imagination prosper, lest they be too proud.

Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them: that compass
me about.

Let hot burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire, and
into the pit, that they never rise up again.

A man full of words, shall not prosper upon the earth: evil shall hunt the
wicked person to overthrow hilll.

Sure I am that the Lord will avenge the poor: and maintain the cause of the
helelesse.

The righteous also shall guie thanks unto they name: and the ^ust shall
continue in thy sight.

Domine clamaui. psalm 141.
LOrd, I call upon thee, haste thee unto me: and consider my voice, when I
cry unto thee.

Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense: and let the lifting
up of my hands be an evening facrifice.

Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: and keep the door of my lips.

O let not mine heart be cnclined to any evil thing: let me not be occupied
in ungodly works, with the man that work Wickedness, left I eat of such
things as please them.

Let the righteous rather smite me friendiy: and reprove me.

But let not their precious balmes break mine head: yea, I will pray yet
against their wickedness.

Let their judges be overthrown in ftony places: that they may hear my
words, for they are sweet.

Our bones lie scattered before the pit: like as when one breaks and he weth
wood upon the earth.

But mine eyes look unto thee, O Lord God: in thee is my trust, O cast not
out my soul.

Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me: and from the traps of
the wicked doers.

Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together: and let me ever escape
them.

Voce mea ad Dominum. Psalm. 142.
ICried unto ye Lord with my voice: Evening prayer.
yea, even unto the Lord did I make my supplication.

I powered out my complaints before him: and showed him of my trouble.

When my spirit was in heaviness, thou knew my path: in ye way wherein I
walked, have they privily laid a snare for me.

I looked also upon my right hand: and saw there was no man that would know me.

I had no place to flee unto: and no man cared for my soul.

I cried unto thee, O Lord, and said: thou art my hope, and my portion in the
land of the living.

Consider my complaint: for I am brought very low.

O deliver me from my persecutours: for they are too strong for me.

Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy name: which
thing if thou will grant me, then shall the righteous resort unto my company.

Domine exaudi. Psalm. 143.
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and consider my desire: hearken unto me for thy
truth and righteousness sake.

And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man
living be iusrified.

For the enemy has persecuted my soul, he has smitten my life down to the
ground: he has laid me in the darkness, as the men that have been long
dead.

Therefore is my spirit bexed within me: and my heart within me is desolate.

Yet do I remember the time past, I muse upon all they works: yea, I exercise
my self in the works of thy hands.

I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul gaspeth unto thee as a thirsty
land.

Hear me, O Lord, and that soon, for my spirit wareth saint: hide not thy
face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.

O let me hear thy loving kindness betimes in the morning, for in thee is my
trust: show thou me the way that I should walk in, for I lift up my soul unto
thee.

Deliver me, O Lord, frommine enemies: for I flee unto thee to hide me.

Leach me to do the thing that pleases thee, for thon art my God: let thy
loving spirit lead me forth into the land of rithteousnesse.

Quicken me, O Lord, for thy names sake: and for thy rithteousnesse sake,
bring my soul out of trouble.

And of thy goodness slay mine enemies: and destroy all them that vex my
soul, for I am thy servant.

Benedictus Dominus. Psalm. 144.
BLessed be the Lord my strength: Morning prayer.
which teaches my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.

My hope and my fortress, my castle and deliverer, my defender, in whom I
trust: which subdueth my people that is under me.

Lord, what is man that thou have such respect unto him: or the some of man
that thou so regardest him?

Man is like a thing of naught: his time passes away like a shadow.

Bow the heavens, O Lord, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall
smoke.

Cast forth thy lightning, and tear them: shoot out thine arrows, and
consume them.

Send down thine hand from above: deliver me, and take me out of the great
waters, from the hand of strange children.

Whose mouth talks of vanity: and their right hand is a right hand of
wickedness.

I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: and sing praises unto thee upon a
ten stringed Lute.

Thou have given victory unto Kings: and have delivered David thy servant from
the peril of the sword.

Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children: whose mouth talks
of vanitir, and their right hand is a right hand of miquitie.

That our sons may grow up as thd young plants: and that our daughters may
be as the polished corners of the Temple.

That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner of store: that our
sheep may bring soorth thousands and teu thousands in our streets.

That our oxen may be strong to labor, that there be no decay: no leading
into captivity, and no complaining in our streets.

Happy are the people that be in such a case: yea, blessed are the people
which have the Lord for their God.

Exaltabo te Deus. Psalm. 145.
I will magnify thee, O God, my King: and I will praise thy Name for ever and
ever.

Every day will I give thanks unto thee: and praise thy Name for ever and ever.

Great is the Lord, and marvelous worthy to be praised: there is no end of
his greatness.

One generation shall praise thy works unto another: and declare thy power.

As for me, I will be talking of thy worship: thy glory, thy praise, and
wonderour works.

So that men shall speak of the might of thy marvelous acts: and I will also
tell of thy greatness.

The memorial of thine abundant kindness shall be showed: and men shall sing of
thy righteousness.

The Lord is gracious and merciful: long suffering, and of great goodness.

The Lord is loving unto every man: and his mex^^^ is over all his works.

All thy works praise thee, O Lord: and thy Saints give thanks unto thee.

They show the glory of thy kingdom: and talk of thy power.

That thy power, thy glory, and mightiness of thy kingdom: might be known
unto men.

Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom: and thy dominion endures throughout
all ages.

The Lord vpholdeth all such as fall: and lifts up all those that be down.

The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord: and thou give them their meat in
due season.

Thou openest thine hand: and fillest all things living with plenteousnesse.

The Lord is righteous in all his ways: and holy in all his works.

The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him: yea, all such as call upon
him faithfully.

He will fulfill the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their
cry, and will help them.

The Lord preserves all them that love him: but scatteretly abroad all the
ungodly.

My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh give thanks
unto his holy Name for ever and ever.

Lauda anima mea. Psalm. 146.
Praise the Lord, O my soul, while I live will I praise the Lord: yea, as long
as I have any being, I will sing praises unto my God.

O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man: for there is no
help in them.

For when the breath of man goes forth, he shall turn again to his earth:
and then all his thoughts perish.

Blessed is he that has the God of Jacob for his help: and whose hope is in
the Lord his God.

Which made heaven and earth, the sea and all that therein is: which keeps
his promise for ever.

Which helps them to right that suffer wrong: which seedeth the hungry.

The Lord loses men out of prison: the Lord gives sight to the blind.

The Lord helps them that are fallen: the Lord cares for the righteous.

The Lord cares for the strangers, he defends the fatherless and widow: as
for the way of the ungodly, he turns it vpside down.

The Lord thy god O Sion, shall be King for evermore: and throughout all
generations.

Laudate Dominum, Psalm. 147.
Praise ye Lord, Evening prayer
for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our god: yea, a joyful and
pleasant thing it is to be thankful.

The Lord does build up Jerusalem: and gather together the outcasts of Israel.

He heals those that are broken in heart: and gives medicine to heal their
sickness.

He tells the number of the stars: and calls them all by their names.

Great is our Lord, and great is his power: yea, and his wisdom is infimte.

The Lord sets up the meek: and brings the ungodly down to the ground.

O siug unto the Lord with thanksgining: sing praises upon the harp unto our

Which gives fodder unto the cattle: and feeds the young ravens that call
upon him.

He has no pleasure in the strength of an horse: neither delights he in any
man's legs.

But the Lords delight is in them that fear him: and put their trust in his
mercy.

Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God O Sion.

For he has made fast the bars of thy gates and has Blessed thy children
within thee.

He makes peace in thy borders: and fills thee with the flower of wheat.

He sends forth his commandment upon earth: and his word runs very
swiftly.

He gineth snow like wool: and seattereth the hoare frost like ashes.

He tastes forth his ye like morsels: who is able to abide his ashes.

He sends out his word, and melts them: he blows with his wind, and the
waters flow.

He shows his word unto Iarob: his statutes and ordinaures unto Israel.

He has not dealt so with any nation: neither have the heathue knowledge of
his laws.

Laudate Dominum. Psalm. 148.
O Praise the Lord of heaven: praise him in the height.

Praise him all ye Angels of his: praise him all his host.

Praise him all ye heavens: and ye waters that be above the heavens.

FINIS.
Certain godly prayers to be used for sundry purposes.
A general consession of sins, to be said every Morning.
O Almighty God our heanenly Father, I confess and acknowledge, that I am a
miserable and a wretched sinner, and have manifold ways most grievously
transgressed thy most godly conunaundements, through wicked thoughts, ungodly
lusts, sinful words and deeds, committed all my whole life. In sin am I
borne and conceived, and there is no goodness in me, in as much as if thou
should enter into thy narrow judgment with me, judging me according unto
the same, I were never able to susser and abide it, but must needs pertsh and
be damncd for eucr: So little help, comfort, or succor is there either in me,
or in any other creature. Only this is my comfort (O heavenly Father) that
thon did not spare thy only dear beloved son, bnt did gine him up
unto the most bitter, and most vile and slanderous death of the cross for me,
that he might so pay the ransom for my sins, satisfy thy indgment, still and
pacify thy wrath, reconcile me again unto thee, and pnrchase me thy grace and
fanour, and cuerlasting life. where fore throngh the merit of his most bitter
death and passion, and through his innocent bloodshedding, I beseech thee, O
heavenly Father, that thou will vouchsase to be gracious and merciful unto me,
to fergiue and pardon me all my sins, to lighten my heart whit thy holy
Spirit, to renew, confirm, and strengthen me with a right and perfect faith,
and to inflame me in love toward thee and my neighbor, that I may hencefoorty
with a willing and glad heart, walk as it becomes me in thy most godly
commaunements, and so glorify and praise thee everlastingly. And also that I
may with a free conscience and quiet heart, in all manner of temptations,
afflictions, or necessities, and eucn in the very pangs of death, cry boldly
and merrily unto thee, and say, I believe in God the father almighty, maker of
heaven and earth, and in lesus Christ, etc. But, O Lord God heavenly Father, to
comfort my self in affliction and temptation with these articles of the
Christian faith, it is not in my power, for faith is thy gift: and forasmuch as
thou will be prayed unto, and called vyon for it, I come unto thee, to pray and
beseech thee, both for that and for all other my necessities, even as thy dear
beloved Son our Savior Ie-sus Christ himself has taught us, And from the
very bottom of my heart I cry, and say, Our Father which art in heaven
hallowed be thy Name, etc.

A prayer to be said in the Morning.
O Merciful Lord God heavenly Father, I ren dermost high lauds, praise, and
thanks unto thee, that thou have preserved me both this might, and all the
time and days of my life hitherto, under thy protection, and have suffe red me
to live unto this present hour. And I beseech thee heartily, that thon wilt
vouchsafe to receive mce this day, and the residue of my whole life from hence
forth; into thy tuition, ruling and governing me with thy holy Spirit, that
all manner of darkness, of misbeliefe, infidelity, and of carnal lusts and
affections, may be betterly chased and driven out of my heart, and that I may
be justified and saved both body and soul through a right and perfect faith,
and so walk in the light of thy most godly truth, to thy glory and praise,
and to the profit and furtherance of my neighbor, through Jesus Christ our
Lord and Saui-our. Amen.

Another prayer for the morning.
O Almighty and most gracious God, we heartily thank thee for the sweet
sleep and comfortable rest which thou have given us this night: and for as much
as thou have commanded by thy holy word that no man should be idle, but all
occupied in godly and virtuous exercises, every man according to his calling:
we most humbly beseech thee, that thine eyes may attend upon us daily defend
us, cherish, comfort and govern us, and all our counsails, studies and
labors, in such wise, that we may spend and bestow this day according to thy
most holy will, without the hurting of our neighbors, and that we may
deligently and warily eschew and avoid all things that should displease thee,
set thee always before our eyes, live in thy fear, working that which may be
found accepteble before thy divine May stie, through Christ our Lord, Amen.

A prayer for the Evening.
O Most mighty Lord our father, and God e uerlasting, full of pity and
compassion, we acknowledge and confess that we be not worthy to lift by our
eyes to heaven, much less to present our selves before thy Majesty, with
confidence that thou will hear our prayers and grant our requests, if we
consider our own deserving. For our conseiences do accuse us, and our sins
witness against us, and we know that thou art an upright judge, which do
not justify the sinners and wicked men, but punishest the faults of such as
transgress thy command ments. Yet most merciful Father, since it has
pleased thee to command us to call on thee in all our troubles and adversities,
promising even then to help us, When we feel our selves (as it were)
swallowed up of death and desperation: we vttterly renounce all worthy
confidence, and flee to thy soue-raigne bounty, as our only stay and refuge,
besceehinng thee not to call to remembrance our manisold sins and
wicked-nesse, where by we continually provoke thy wrath and in dignation
against us, neither our negligence and unkindness, which have neither worthily
csreemed, nor in our lives sufficiently expressed the sweet comfort of thy
Gospel revealed unto us, but rather to accept the obedience and death of thy
Son Jesus Christ, who by offering up his body in Sacrifice once for all, has
made sufficient recompense for all our sins. Have mercy therefore upon us, O
Lord, and forgive us our offenses. Teach us by thy holy Spirit, that we may
rightly weigh them, and earnestly repent for the same: and so much the rather,
O Lord, because that the reprobate, and such as thou have forsaken, cannot
praise thee, nor call upon thy Name: but the repenting heart, the sorrowful
mind, the conscience oppressed, hungering and thirsting for thy grace, shall
ever set forth thy praise and glory. And albeit we be but worms and dust,
yet thou art our Creator, and we be the work of thy hands: yea, thou art our
Father, and we thy childreen: thou art our shepherd, and we thy flokec:
thou art our redeemer, and we thy people whom thou have bought: thou art our
God, and we thine inheritance. Correct us not there fore in thine anger, O
Lord, neither according to our deserts punnish us, but mercifully thastise us
with a fatherly affection, that all the world may know that at what time
soeuera sinner does repent him of his sin, from the bottom of his heart,
thou will put away his wickedness out of thy remembrance, as thou have
promised by thine holy prophet.

Finally, forasmuch as it has pleased thee to make the night for man to rest
in, as thou have ordained him the day to travel: Grant, O dear Father, that
we may so take out vodily rest, that our souls may continuaily watch for the
time that our Lord Jesus Christ shall appear for our deliverance out of this
mortal life, and in the mean season that we, not overcome by any fantasies,
dreams, or other temptations, may fully set our minds upon thee, love thee,
fear thee, and rest in thee: Furthermore, that our sleep be note excessive or
over much, after the insatiable desires of our flesh: but only sufficient to
content our weak nature, that we may be the better disposed to live in all
godly conuersatiou, to the glory of shine holy Name, and profit of our
brethren. Amen.

A most necessary prayer.
O Lord Jesus Christ, which art true Sun of the world, evermore arising, and
never going down, which by thy most wholesome appearing and sight, do bring
forth, preserve, nourish and refresh all things, as well that are in heaven, as
also that are on earth, we beseech thee mercifully and favorably to shine into
our hearts, that the night and darkness of sins, and the mists of errors
on cuery side driven away, thou brightly shining within out hearts, we may all
out life space go with out any stumbling or offense, and may decently and
seemly walk (as in the day time) being pure and clean from the works of
darkness, and abounding in all good works which God has prepared for us to
walk in, which with the Father and with the holy Ghost, live and reignest
for ever and ever. Amen.

The prayer of Manasseh King of the Jews.
O Lord Almighty, God of our fathers, Abra ham Isar^nd Jacob, and of their
right ouseed, (...) made heaven and earth with all (...) which have bound the
sea by the word of thy commandment, which ha^^ (...) up the deep and sealed
it by thy terribl^,and glorious name, whom all do fear and tremble before
thy power:for the Majesty of thy glory cannot be borne, and thine angry
threatening toward sinners is importable, but thy merciful promise is
unmeasurable and bnscatcable. For thou art the most high Lord, of great com
passion, long suffering, and most merciful, and repentest for man's miscrics.
Thou, O Lord, according to thy great good nesse have promised ^
repentance and forgiveness to them that sin against thee and for thine
infinite m^rcies have appointed repentance unto sinners that they may be
saved. Thou therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the just, have not appointed
repentance to the just, as to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not ^
sinned against thee, but thou have appointed repcntance unto nice that am a
sinner: for I have sinned above the number of the sand of the sea. By
transgressions, O Lord, are multiplied: my transgressions are exceeding many:
and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of the heavens for the
multitude of mine vnrighte ousnes. I am bowed down with many iron bands, that
I cannot lift up mine head, neither have I any telese, For I have provoked thy
wrath, and done evil before thee. I did not thy will, neither kept I thy
commandments. I have set up abominations, and have multiplied offenses. Now
therefore I bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching thee of grace. I have
sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge my transgressions: but I
humbly beseech thee, forgive me: O Lord forgive me, and destroy me not with
my transgressions. Be not angry with me for ever by reserving evil for me,
neither condemn me into the lower parts of the earth. For thou art the God,
even the God of them that repent: and in me thou will show all thy goodness:
for thou will save me that am unworthy, according to thy great mercy: theresre
I will praise thee for ever all they days of my life. For all the power of the
heavens praise thee, and thine is the glory for ever and ever. Amen.

A prayer containing the duty of every true Christian.
O Most mighty God, merciful and loving Father, I wretched sinner come unto
thee in the name of thy dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ my only Savior and
redeemer: and I most humbly beseech thee for his sake to be merciful unto me,
and to cast all my sins out of thy sight and remembrance, through the merits
of his bloody death and passion.

Power upon me (O Lord) thy holy spirit of wisdom and grace: govern and
lead me by thy holy word, that it may be a lantern unto my feet, and a light
unto my steps. Show thy mercy upon me, and so lighten the natural blindness
and darkness of my heart through thy grace, that I may daily be renewed by
the same spirit and grace: By the which (O Lord) purge the grossenes of my
hearing and understanding, that I may profitably read, hear, and under stand
thy word and heavenly will, believe, and practice the same in my life and
conversation, and evermore hold fast that blessed hope of everlasting life.

Mortify and kill all vite in me, that my life may express my faith in thee:
mercifully hear the humble suite of thy servant, and grant me thy peace all my
days: Graciously pardon mine infirmities, and defend me in all dangers of
body goods and name: but most chiefly my soul against all assaults,
temptations, accusations, subtle baits and sleights of that old enemy of
mankind Satan that roaring Lion, ever seeking whom he may devour.

And here (O Lord) I prostrate, with most humble mind crave of thy diuing
Majesty, to be merciful unto the universal Church of thy Son Christ: and
specially according to my bounden duty beseech thee for this sake to bless,
save, and defend the principal memeber thereof, thy servant our most dear and
Souercigne Lord King James, increase in his royal heart true faith, godly
^eale, and love of the same: And grant him victory over all his enemies, a
long, prosperous, and honorable life upon earth, a blessed end, and life
everlasting.

Moreover, O Lord, grant unto his Majesty's most honorable Counselors, and
every other member of this thy Church of England, that thy and we in our
several callings, may truly and godly serve thee: Plant in our hearts true
fear and honor of thy Name, obedience to our Prince, and love to our
neighbors. Increase in us true faith and religion: Replenish our minds with
all goodness, and of thy great mercy keep us in the same till the end of our
lines: Give unto us a godly zeal in prayer, true humility in prosperity,
perfect patience in adversity, and continuallioy in the holy Ghost

And lastly I commend unto thy fatherly protection, all that thou have given
me, as wife, children and servants: Aid me O Lord, that I may govern, norish,
and bring them up in thy fear and service. And forsmuch as in this world I
must always be at war and strife, not with one sort of enemies, but with an
infinity number, not only with flesh and blood, but with the devil which is
the prince of darkness, and with wicked men executors of his most damnable
will: Grant me therefore thy grace, that being armed with thy defense, I may
stand in this battle with an invincible constaucie against all corruption,
which I am compassed with on every sde until such time as I having ended the
combat, which during this life I must sustain, in the end I may attain to
thy heavenly rest, which is prepared for me and all thine elect, through
Christ our Lord and only Savior. AMEN.
