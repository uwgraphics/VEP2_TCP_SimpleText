A treatise.
Love and desire
Does me require
So effectually
I can no less
Of gentilnesse
But grant it willyngly.
Some pain to take
For desires sake
And herty assurance
With yncke and pen
The gentill Walshmenne
Their fame to advance.
As shall insewe
Matter full true
By storis euiedent
Of auctours old
Both write and told
Famous and excellent
Trustyng in this
No man there is
My purpose will disdain
If my report
May them comfort
I shall be glad and feign.
When I consider
And call together
To my remembrance
The regalitee
The nobilitee
The redoubted puissaunce.
The high parentage
The fearce courage
The acts most marciall
The princely fame
The worthy name
The blood imperial.
The ciuilitee
The vtilitee
The high magnificence
The policy
The industry
The noble aduertence
Of there progenitors
Most mighty conquerours
The enimyes to decline
Excelling far
In strength of war
That were before there time
Whose worthy fame
Inhauncid there name
As men of lusty courage
Like princes great
Kingdoms to geat
For them and there lynage
As noble brute
In his persute
And act triumphal
To his estate
Kingdoms gate
And made them Imperial
First to begin
Their birthe their kynne
Their generation
Then to conuoy
From noble Troy
The whole procreacion.
Ye must then look
In the fifth book
Of the antiquities
Where Birosus
And Isodorus
In their Ethimolegies.
Affirms plain
As authors twain
That after Noe his flood
Osiris ye furst king in Egypth the second son of ^ame.
The first famous king
In Egipte reignyng
Was called Osiris the good.
But yet Moses
In Genesis
Names him Mizraim
A prince of fame
The first of name
That conquest did begin.
By force of strength
He gate at length
To his dominion
The world round
Except the ground
Dew unto Babylon
Most circumspecte
In this effect
Accoumpte the nobles all
He was the furst
In Egypt just
Emonges the people rural.
With great industry
And labor of body
The plough there did invent
To ear and sow
In countres low
Idleness to preuente
To graffe and to plant
In places skante
Uynes most holsum and good
He taught them plain
The barley grain
To norishe the lusty blood
His time before
They had no store
But acornes and leves grene
No other trute
For there refute
Emonge them was there seen
Till Osyris
Of his goodness
Applied both sense and mind
In such distres
For there redres
Some remedy to find
Auctors does accord
He went abroad
His virtues only to show
In strange regions
Whose affecctions
Took place in years few
First to Berbarye
A famous contrye
The people gross and rude
Standing in affryke
Them did he seek
There blyndnes to exclude
Then to Almayne
He took the plain
That kyndome to advance
Where in like wise
He did practice
All thing for their plesaunce
Then at the instaunce
Of the Italians
With mighty apparel
The cruel Titans
Put to vtteraunce
By fearcenes of battle
Full shortly than
Down to Tuscan
He went with all his men
To a city strong
Large and long
Where he reigned years ten.
Called Uitarbie
Thus labored he
The people to conducte
From place to place
Of princely grace
Only them to instruct.
Then into Greece
A country fearce
A long the seas he went
Unto a province
Of great excellence
With like famous intent.
As auctours do witness
Named Pilloponnes
Where stood the strong city
Called Argeos
Of noblenes
Having the souereintee.
Where he unfeigned
Famously reigned
XXXvii. years just
Till at the last
The years gone past
To Egypt he had a lust.
Prepared home
Where cruel Typhon
As says Diodorus
His brother untrue
By treason him slew
Of mind malicious.
Bocas confesses
Al so expresses
How the people rural
Changed Osiris
Into Sirapis
And so they did him call
Affermyng plain
How he certain
In heaven was stallid
In such manner wise
Affter there guyse
A God was he called
Labyn or Libus
Hercules or Libus son of Osiris.
Called great Hercules
The son of Sirapys
As auctours says
His fathers death
Reuengid shortly this
Sent a deffyaunce
To all the gyauntes
Throughout the wordle round
First into Phenyce
Did he enterprise
His enymyes to confound
To his estate
That land he gat
In manner invincible
By wonderful strenghte
Percyd it at length
And made it diuisible
Then into phrigie
A prouynce myghtie
Where he slew Tipheus
A gyaunt strong
Were it right or wrong
And gave him to Athus
Which he begat
Being associate
With a lady fair and bright
Called Dinphale
Which did prevail
Most pleasant in his sight.
From thence to Affricke
Fearce cruel and quick
Of heart coragious
Slew the Giaunt
Mighty and puissaunt
Named great Atheus.
In token of fame
Altered that name
Then called barbary
After Libus
Named it thus
The great land of Libie.
For a memorial
By art natural
He made a pillar strong
His conquest great
Should not forgeate
The people there among.
Then to Gaulceltike
Full princely like
His passage did he take
Where great Jupiter
Did him prefere
And much there did him make
For more amitye
Gave galathyae
A pryncesse of high astate
His daughter dear
To be his fere
Such honor there he gate
Where he was crouned
Whose fame reboundyd
With gal^thy his wife
In kingdoms far
After that Jupiter
Had altered his life
Then With his army
Into Italye
Him self did advance
Brake mountains hye
By strength of Body
And mighty ordinance
And where the way was
Haynouse to pass
And wonder dificill
Brake them down right
By force of might
Without tariyng any while
But entered by strength
Where he at length
As Byrosus does witness
His enymies slew
His force to renew
Manfully did them oppress
Then down he came
Unto Tuscane
The Tytans to subdewe
For malice alone
Of cruel Typhon
Of treytors most untrue
Where for his sake
Such slaughter did make
His enimyes to confound
That there doleful cry
Above the sky
To the heavens did abound
Such was his grace
With in short space
They were all overthrown
Clean out of fame
As though their name
Had never been known
Thus this noble man
Wholly became
Possessor of Italy
Fully years ten
Where he reigned then
As A prince strong and mighty
From thense into spain
Where men did complain
The great extorcion
Done by violence
Without resistance
In that famous region
By gyauntes strong
Which them among
The people did oppress
Found no refute
In there persute
Therwooes then to redres
Till great Hercules
Of his gentilnes
With most manfull courage
Came down with speed
In time of need
To a void there outrage
Sought them about
Having no doubt
Of their mighty puysaunce.
From place to place
Did them inchace
By long contynuaunce
By knyghtly strength
Gate them at length
Where they might not astert
As a prince royal
He slew them all
With a coragyouse heart
After whose death
Diodorus says
In his Antiquyties
Who List to look
In the.v. book
That this noble hercules
Did there remain
Till death certain
His body did oppres
Where he does lie
Full sumtuoslye
As Auctors bear witness
His Sepulture
In such manner
Raised was with pillars hye
That men might se
Of every degree
The place as they pas by
And yet the same
In token of fame
Evermore for to increase
Is called this day
As Spanyardes say
Gaades le Hercules
After came Tustus
Tustus son of Hercules.
A prince full famous
Son to great hercules
As next heir of blood
Notable and good
Full of all gentilnes
Which in Italy
Reigned quyetly
Without let or dysturbaunce
Right well-beloved
No cause mouyd
Of his misgouernaunce Altheus so^n of Tustus.

Next Altheus
Son of Tustus
Of Italy was king
A Prince of renown Comboblaston son of blaston which Blaston was son of
Altheus and ded his father living

With Scepter and crown
All his time then living
Then Comboblaston
The son of Blaston
Which was son of Altheus
For his worthynes
And passing goodness
Was made then Coritus
Which was a name
Of worthy fame
Excellyng all other
As at that day
As who would say
A second Iupyter.
This noble king
Record of writing
By Electra his wife
Had princes three
Of noble degree
All borne in his life
Dardanus ye second son of Comboblaston buyl.+ded the City of derdane
The first Iaseus
The next dardanus
The thrd Armonya
Dardanus then
With all his men
Went in to phrigia
A prouence strong
Myghtie and Long
Full of all pleasaunce
Stondyng in Asia
Called dardanya
His name only to avaunce
His people and he
Raised a City
With towers wonderful hye
Wallid it about
Having no doubt
Of any foren enemy
When it was walled
Then was it called
Dardane after Dardanus
In all Asya
Or in phrigya
Was none half so famous
This City playme
Was made certain
The year for to acconpte
Of Moses
A.C. doubtless
Xiiii. more did A mount
(...)
Next Dardanus
His son Erictonius
There took possession
Of ^yght enteryng
As Lord and king
By dew succession
^
Then Troos the famous
Son of Erictonius
Of all Phrigia was king
For mighty puyssaunce
And great abundance
All other surmounting
Eusebius
Affirmyth us
This king had sons three
The first Ilius
The next Assaracus
The third as in degree
The youngest of al
Which men did call
Worthy Ganymydes
Whom Tantalus
Most auericious
Of pity all merciles
Falselye did persewe
A traytore untrue
With couetyse full replete
Took monye and hire
His death to conspire
Of Jupiter king of Crete
Troos this famousse king
Sore Lamenting
This foul ingratitude
Of mortal hate
And soden debate
Raised a multitude
Of heart dolorus
Drove Tantalus
Dute of high phrigie
Forcing him at lenghe
By pryncely strength
Out of Paphlagie
Diodorus
Also Birosus
Affermyth verily
That Tantalus
Full ungracious
Dyed myserablye
For his offense
And vile pretense
So often times frequented
(...) sayn
That he certain
In hell should be tourmented
With hunger and thurst
Having a lust
Always unto his meat
His belly empty
With dyshes plenty
And yet nothing could eat
In drink did Swyme
Above the Chynne
His body hot and dry
All was in waste
Non could he taste
Yet for thurst ready to die
Ovid does show
In words few
And plainly does us tell
How he should Lie
With out mercy
In the deep lake of hell
When cruel Tantalus
Most inpituouse
Was brought to subicecion
And that noble Troy
Did fully enjoy
Tantalus possecion
King of high phrygia
In all Asya
Was none so myghtie a king
So much redoubtid
So well assured
So much honor incresing
His City plain
Called Dardaine
As auctours write and say
Was called than
Of every man
The great City of Troy
Only after his name
To increase his fame
As a prince most fortunate
The country about
Standing in doubt
Obayed his noble estate
And thus was he
Of magnanimytie
Redoubted on every side
None was so boulde
Other young or old
His force that durst abide
Next this famous king
After insuweing
Was his son Ilius
He had a brother Assaracus the younger son(...) of Troos

Of father and mother
Named Assaracus
Of full noble blodde Capis son(...) of Assaracu(...)

Famous and good
His son called was Capis
Stories does devise Anchises so^(...) of Capis.

Capis Likewise
Was father to Anchises
Anchises was
Father to Eneas
As saint Augusti^e does record Eneas son(...) of Anchise

Who list to look
In the.xviii. book
Called the Cite of God
Where he endyteth
Plainly resiteth
The herd and dred full chance
Like as he fande
By se and Land
Through fortunes ordinance
How he also
Went to appollo
To the I Will of delphos
Which by miracle
At his Oracle
Showed him ye whole purpos
How he should be
Of souereintye
Full notable increasing
And that his fate
Was predestinate
In Italy to be king
This Eneas
Graundfather was
Unto noble young brute
As shall appear
Afterward here
The stock the branch and frut
From dardanus
As gaulfridus
The story does recompte
Whose regalite
In great Asiie
All other did surmounte
Of Jupiters blood
Notable and good
Whose name was stellified
As poets do fame
In heaven certain
There to be deified
His marciall wars
Surmounting the stars
Made him celestial
After pagan guyse
In such manner wise
With there gods to be coequal
In Libie land
His temple did stand
Freate with gold pearl and stone
By divine Oracle
His tabernacle
Made there full long agone
Of the femenyne sex by Galathia, which was daughter to great Iubyter of
Gaulcel (...) and wife to Hercules and mothere to Tustas
Of whose succession
By conputacion
Of there parentage
Perceive may ye
That welshmen be
Of the same stock and lynage
As stories old
Both written and toulde
Makes relacion
Affirminge plain
The time the reign
And the Cituacion
From Jupiters line
Down to declyne
To worthy Dardanus
Consequentely
And finally
To noble Priamus
The last King of Troy A digres(...) treating (...) Destruct(...) of Troy

Whose inward joy
Was clean disconsolate
When the greeks fell
By treason cruel
Appallid his estate
Hear to digress
I must confess
The woeful desolacion
Of noble Troy
The soden decay
And new transmutacion
The Greeks wars
Above the stares
Surmounting in there pride
Supposinge they might
With cruel fight
The heuens to divide
And thus they wrought
The story out sought
As virgell do the witness
A temple there was
Sacred to pallas
The mighty great gods
Made by craft entrayle
As it were deuinale
By heavenly influence
With in troy town
To the high renown
Of her magnyficences
The greeks fraudolent
Of mind violente
There treason to practice
Feigned a pretense
By divine incence
To make a sacrifyes
Before pallas
In hope of grace
To please her deity
Thus they conspired
And often desired
To enter the City
The Trones just
Did not mistrust
There fraudolent treason
Like there pretense
Gave them license
To make there oblacion
And thus Elas
With gile and trespass
As wolves raging wood
Having Liberty
Within the City
Distroyed the noble blod
Far in the night
When that no wight
There treason did suspecte
The greeks untrue
Furthe did Pursue
To furnyshe there effect
Brake out at large
All in a rage
Their fury to declare
Fretyng for ire
With sword and fire
Consumyd the Cite bare
The Trojans at rest
With pains oppressed
For watch feeble and faint
Nothing then knew
What should ensewe
Of there mortal constraynt
Or they could wake
There Cite was take
There king cruelly slain
There Temples spoiled
There gods defoyled
There houses bare and plain
Alas for pity
Full woo is me
This story to behold
When I aduerte
There soden smerte
It makes my heart cold
Oh noble Hector
The chief protector
The Trojans to defend
The very loodsterre
In peace or war
For manhood most to commend
Against whose might
No grekishe Knight
His person might assure
With spear or shilde
In Camp or filde
His stroke that might endure
Alas for pain
Yet was he slain
By pretensid treason
His death conspired
And long desired
By faulse instigacion
For cruel Achylles
Of pity marceles
Or he could well aduerte
His back all bare
With a staff square
Percyd his manfull heart
His helm unlaced
His coyffe vnbrased
His shilde lyeng on the ground
As he did repair
To take the Air
Gave him his uortall wound
Oghe cruel greeks
Cursid by your chekes
With all your cursed treason
Sclaudered is your name
To your eternal shame
For your abhominacion
And thou Achilles
Most wreche of wreches
Prouers of mind and will
Against all right
So famous a knight
With treason for to kill
Who will not assent
The death to lament
Of so princely a man
Which was doubtless
Of knighthod pereles
Account lithe ye worrdle began
As in Troys book
Who list to look
Shall se the surphisage
The magnanimity
The nobilite
Of him and his parentage
The imperial blond
Most famous and good
Of nature Celestial
As poets do fayn
They came certain
(...) ye blind (...)orlde they (...)erra^ed god (...)s for exceling in fears
of nobleness
Of the Gods immortal
They were declared
Whith gods compared
Through there magnificence
The truethe known well
Because they did excel
In pryncely excellence
What should I write
Or further indite
This process lamentable
The doleful destres
The mortal heuines
Of Priamus most notable
Or yet of Eccuba
Or wife Cassandra
Their importable pain
Or of Polexena
The flower of Asia.
Which was so cruelly slain
Of lusty Troylus
Or young Dephebus
Or of the blood fraternall
Paris or Helenus
A case most peteous
Of greeks slain were they al
Or what should I say
Of the greeks decay
And mortal adventure
Sith that the air
In there repair
Turned dark and obscure
Cruel Neptunus
Waxed contrarius
Dangerus to be hold
Eolus a lofte
Raging full often
With storms wete and cold
Ulcanus then
Out of his den
Forgid the thouders great
With tirie leuin
Down from heaven
Unto Cerberus seat
The gods plain
Had such disdain
At there shameful outrage
Of very despite
Them to acquit
Send such froward passage
There ships tossed
And all to frussed
By sturdy violence
Upon rocks grounded
There people drowned
For all there resistance
But now to proceed
My purpose to spyed
Like as I furst begane
To show the distent
And birthe excellent
Of the gentile Welshmen
After that Troy
Was brought to decay
By fortunes violence
And that there was
As in that case
No help of resistaunce
But that the Cite
By grekyshe crueltye
Was consumed all bare
As I said first
By treason unjust
The truth to declare
Then the noble blood
Ancient and good
Of Priamus descent
By knyghtlye courage
Took there voyage
By sober aduisement
To sundry regions
With there provisions
And marciall apparel
There states to renew
Kingdoms to Subdewe
Only by force of Battle
As lustye young Franco
Which was also
The son of noble Hector
Set meeris and bands
In sondre lands
As King and Emperor
First into hungary
With his Chiualry
His stonderds displayeng
Then into France
With his ordinance
His army conuaiyng
Subdwed the Gauls
Brake towers and walls
Brought them to his purpose
And for more fame
Altered that name
And called them francos
But Galfridus
And Eusebius
Does plainly report
That Faramundus
Son of Marconinus
That name did first transporte
Affyrmyng plain
That he certain
Being of the Troianes blood
In token of Love
Did it remove
And thus the mattier stood
Likewise Turcus
The son of Troilus
Entered phaso the less
As Antonius
And Entropius
Berith thereto witness
Gate there strong piles
For all there wiles
There castelles and there towers
Slew them certain
In the filde plain
Like mighty conqueroures
Also Elenus
Son of Prianus
By manfull occacion
Within short space
The land of Trace
Brought to subuercion
Noble Eneas
From Troy did pas
With myghtie provisions
With speres and shildes
Perced the fildes
Of sundry regions
By se and by land
Diverse chauncys fande
Uirgill does us assure
By violente rage
Arryuid at Cartage
By soden adventure
His ships nere lost
Driven to that cost
By dreadful violence
Where Dido the Queen
Most goodly besene
Reioysed his presence
Then with his host*
The countries did cost
By prudent pollicye
In his defense
By high providence
To the frontes of Italy
Where by his manhood
And famous knighthood
After many strong battle
Slew Turocelyne
In help of Latyne
One of the kings of Itaill
For his worthynesse
He weddid doubtless
The Daughter of Latinus
Called Lauina
Next after Chensa
The Daughter of Priamus
As Sabellicus
And Eusevius
Affermith both plain
That this is true
He had Issewe
Of these princesses twain
First of Chensa
Borne in Asia
Was his son Astanius (...) humuis son of Eneas

Next in Italye
Successiuelye
Siluius Posthumus
Of Whom is discendid
As is pretendid
By Titus Liuius
Who list to read
The story in deed
Of Brutus Albinus
Most noble brute Brute son of Silu^^^ of whom descendid the king of
Brittayne linially unto Cadwalyder

The seed, the fruit
The name and language
The plain descent
The norishement
Of the welshmens lineage
Thus may ye se
That welshmen be
Of the blood imperial
Of nature fre
Cosyns in degree
To the gods immortal
Of Jupiters line
Next to declyne
To worthy Dardanus
Consequently
And fynallye
To noble Priamus
Then to Eneas
Which father was
To Siluius posthumus
By computacion
Of his succession
Came most noble brutus
As son and heir
Of parson fair
Wondre deliver and light
Strong of body
As Hector hardy
In steel armyd bright
This noble brute
In his persute
And acts most marciall
Entered into greece
Subdued a piece
By his power imperial
A king there was
Named Pandras
A prince right excellent
Unto whose might
There was no wight
To him equiuolent
Having in servitude
A multitude
Of the Trojans blood
vii.M. in number
For to incumbre
With them so sore it stood
For the death doubtless
Of Achilles
Accused of that crime
That they should be
Of one degree
Consenting at that time
This story out sought
This were they brought
In thraldom and bondage
Daily constranyed
Mortally payned
By force of there seruage
Till noble Brute
For there refute
Full like a worthy knight
Deuisid at large
Them to discharge
For all his cruel might
Prefixid a day
His strenghe to assaye
As fortune list to provide
By battle strong
Be it right or wrong
The quarrel to abide
Where king Pandras
Constrained was
By knightlye violence
The field to forsake
His parsonne take
For all his assistence
His Lords distressid
His knights repressid
With many mortal wound
His standerds displayed
Cut and arrayed
Beaten unto the hard ground
And thus Pandras
Constrained was
Of Brute to seek his peace
Gave gooddes and treasure
Out of all measure
His favor to in crease
His love more to win
Gave fair Genogynne
His daughter to him most dear
Unto his wife
Which in her life
As in stories does appear
Had sons three
Of noble degree
All kings of worthy fame
As Antonius
And Eutropius
Affirms both the same
The first Lotrinus
Then Albanactus
The third Ca^bre named was
Which by Election Cambre br(...) his son King of (...)

For his portion
Into wales did pas
To the encrese of fame
After his own name
Called it Cambria
But now by usage
Of corupte language
Named is wallia
As more plainly
And effectually
Herafter shall appear
But first to discus
Of noble Brutus
The story and manner
After that Pandras
Restorid was
To his former estate
His peace assured
His kingdom received
He thought him fortunate
Brute in like wise
It did suffice
His fury to assuage
The Trojans tree
From Captivity
Thraldom and bondage
The land he forsook
The sees he then took
With his ships long and large
Storid with treasure
Out of all measure
By force of their pillage
Then furthe he sailed
Greatly prevailed
By help of Neptunus
Such was his grace
With in short space
Passid the sees dangerus
Landed at Totnesse
Like as the goddess
Diana had promised
Predestinate
To his estate
This land holy comysed
Within this region
Called Albion
Where Gyauntes did dwell
As I do find
Of Cerberus kind
Fearce odius and cruel
Engendered they wear
By sprites of the air
Or by some fyndes infernal
So terryble
So horrible
Were they of nature all
For all there stature
Or dreadful figure
Brute nothing abashed
By furiouse strength
Slew them at length
And this land possessed
As stories old
Both write and toulde
Recomptith more at large
Who list to look
Gaulfridus book
Shall se the surplusage
This shall suffice
The sage and wise
To have in memory
Things so far past
It were in wast
Again to specyfie
Then to remember
Young lusty Cambre
Whom Brute to wales did se^d
There to remain
As soueraygne
That contre to defend
Of whose succession
By computacion
Of stories euidente
Remyanith the blood
Most notable and good
Even now this time present
Never was it myxed
Nether yet altered
With any strange nation
Nether foreyne king
By might usurping
Thereof had possession
The Romans great
Whose power did threat
The world universal
Might never them win By craft or engyn
To there estate royal
Nether Saxon nor Dane
Nor yet foren name
Might their force declyne
With in Cambres land
The Brutes to withstond
By marciall discipline
Yet more to their fame
There blood there name
There contre there language
Was never mixid
Nether yet possessid
With any strange parentage
Further to declare
I dare compare
For there perfeccion
Even as who says
For the true faith
Of Cristes relygion
For length of time
Did never declyne
To infidelite
But constaunt and sure
Always in ure
Sith the time of Lucy
The first Christian king
In britayne reynyng
The years for to account
A.M. three hundred
Lxxx. full nombred
(...) more did amounte
Sith they began
To be Chrystian
In the time of Elentherius
Which did elect
Bishops in effect
By consent of Lucius
Thus they assured
Long have endured
By divine providence
Nether infectid
Nether suspected
Of corrupt conscience
There faith to forsake
But Christ to take
For a full satisfaction
As scripture says
Firmly by faith
Of his blessid passion
Thus the noble brutes
Received the fruits
Of there perfection
In time long past
Right ferme and fast
Without mutacion
CCCC. years plain
XXX. and twain
The time fully accompting
Were they Cristenyd
Surely stablyshid
Before saint Austyns coming
This story tried
Cannot be denied
With all the circumstaunce
The ghostly living
Plainly conferryng
To gods high ordinance
Sythen Lucis time
Did never declyne
From there intellygence
As in this case
Such is there grace
By gods high providence
Likewise sith Brute
Did institute
Cambre first into wales
There to remain
In roughe and plain
Among mountains and vales
Yet unto this day
Perceive ye may
The Same stock and lynage
Of one dissent
This is evident
Without thraldom and bondage
Wholly possessid
Never repressid
By knightly violence
Cuntre or name
Never took shame
They be of such excellence
Sith so noble men
From Troy as then
Of blod are descendid
Me think of truth
There lusty yowthe
Ought to be comendid
Then reason would
Surely I should
There honor advance
My self prepare
Matter to declare
Of there princly ordinance
As Titus Liuius
And Eutropius
Affirmyth to be true
That noble Belyn
Honor to win
The Romans did persewe
When Lucius
And Emilius
Were consulles of honor
Also Camillus
Named furius
Was of rome dictatour
Then noble belyn
The City to win
With standertes displayed
Like Marse for might
In steel armyd bright
His britons conuayid
About the town
With such renown
And knightly ordinance
That the Romans plain
That day were slain
For all the myghtie puyssaunce
The field forsaken
The Senators taken
Spoiled of there array
Like Gods for riches
So great excess
Had they of them that day
The City oppressid
There goods distressid
The Romans unfortunate
This noble Belyn
Honor to win
Upon them was Lauriate
This was in the year
As does appear
By plain descryption
Three hundrid three score
Puttyng to five moore
After Romes fon^dacyon
In contynent then
This noble Bren
His fame more to advance
Into Gallacia
And Macedonia
He took his chance
Also to Galetes
Where he slew Sostes
There Prince and gouernoure
Thus of ye Grekees
In spite of their Chekes
He became a conqueror
Then furthe he went
With his army bent
To the mount Pronasus
To a Temple large
Standing upon a stage
As writith polycarpus
Sacrede to Appolyn
As clerks determyn
Named also delphicus
Spoylid his riches
To his great increse
Made him full glorius
With which abundaunce
And mighti substance
Full like a famous Knight
Raylid Cities old
Feeble and cold
Ruynous in all men's sight
As Mediolana
And Papia
In the fruntes of Lombardye
Likewise verona
Standing in Gallia
With towers pleasant and hye
Cremona
Mantua
Also Burganum
And vincencia
The Cetie Siena
With the City Conum
Thus Titus Liuius
Plainly does discus
A Romayne of great fame
As Polycarpus
And Eutro Pius
Afferme both the same
Thus of the blood
Notable and good
I could worthly express
Kings of renown
With Scepter and crown
A great number doubtless
As noble Arthur
The cheiffe victour
Prouid at all assayes
Whose Marciall knights
Quenchid the Lights
Of all other in those days
The Romans can tell
How it befell
In the time of Lucius
There Emperor slain
With many a Proud Roman
The britons victorius
Also in France
Froll had Like chance
Which was so good a knight
To death was Wounded
His people confounded
Only through Arthurs might
Also Denabus
Great and monstrous
Whose power none might withstand
Arthure him slew
His force to renew
Fought with him hand to hand
Like wise the Saxones
Whose exacciones
He might no wise abide
There cruel rage
For to assuage
Manfully he did provide
Twelve battelles strong
He had them among
Like a famous champion
By strength imperial
He was victore of all
Brought them to subjection
Auctores do express
Bering full wyttnesse
Of his magnificence
With his own hand
Their might to withstand
Of knightly excellence
Slew in one day
Brekyng there arraye
Two hundrid and fourtye Just
Through his manfull might
Constrained were right
In his mercy to trust
Account also
Noble Malgo
The son of dame nature
Whose Angelicke face
For beutie was
Like an heavenly creature
That man and beast
Gladly would rest
Also Birds in the air
His face to behold
As it was toulde
He was so passing fair
There was no King
Of natures formyng
To his equiuolent
So strong of body
So fearce and hardy
In arms so excellent
The Saxones cruel
With many sore batell
Did him right sore inchace
But yet there rigor
His princely honor
Might never deface
The magnanymytie
The nobilite
Of this most princely name
Auctors does expres
The Isles orcades
To Brytayne furst he wan
Now to Cadwalader Cadwalader the last king of Brute by Lineage

To furnyshe my matter
That famous worthy king
The last of dyscent
A Prince Excellent
Over the Britones raynyng
Fabian does write
And plainly resite
His acts right glorius
Affirming them true
How that he slew
A king called Lotharius
Which was king of kente
That time present
By marciall dyssiplyne
And afterward
With strokes hard
The mattier to determyne
Edericus his brother
It was noon other
By force was lykwyse slain
Help or redress
Was none doubtless
Yet were they kings both twa^ie
Also Athelwold
Manfull and boulde
Which was of Sowthsex king
Thought him full sure
Hable to endure
His batell conueiyng
Against Cadwaladre
Of inward displeasure
Hatred and cruelnes
Met in the field
With spear and shilde
Of very wilfulnes
Athelwolde that day
Who ever said nay
With many mortal wound
Lay ded and slain
The Saxones plain
Beaten down to the ground
The Brutes victoriouse
The Saxones tymerouse
The field durst not abide
For dread and fear
Fled here and there
Abroad on every side
Thus Cadwalader
The revenger
Of there ambicion
Brought them full low
There faults to know
Under his subjection
Also Galfridus
Plainly does discus
Affirmyng more at large
How that the Saxones
By composicions
Of all there baronage
Held of Cadwaladre
As of there gouernoure
By way of love and finage
Like their degrees
By gifts and fees
As of his patronage
This princely manne
This Christian
This worthy famous king
Stories does recompte
He did surmounte
All other Living
To whom god above
In token of love
Made demonstracion
By his Angel plain
That he certain
Should leave his region
Such mortalite
Such adversity
Such plages of pestilence
Such infeccion
Such corrucpcion
By heavenly influence
That time there was
That he Alas
Of force was constrained
With woeful heart
Must needs depart
His subjects were so payned
Fruits upon the ground
None could be found
In help of their redress
The Earth all bare
The people in care
Sorrow and heuinesse
The Brutes expelled
No longer dwelled
With in this region
The Saxones plain
Did it attain
For them and there succession
No resistance
Nether yet defense
Of the Brutes was there made
Away they went
By one assent
Even as the Angel bade
Without comfort
As men amorte
Lackyng consolacion
Having no lust
But only a trust
Of their expectacion
In the prophesy
Which did specifye
The holy translacion
Of Cadwaladre
From Rome hidre
By Santificacion
That when his bones
Were translated ones
In to this region
Then should the Brutes
Receive there fruits
And first possessyon
This did the Angel
Graciously tell
In there woeful distres
That his noble blood
Ancient and good
Should revive in his success
Which should restore
To them much more
Of consolacion
By special grace
Than ever was
Of there succession
This noble king
Gods will perceiving
Called his son Iuory
Likewise send for
His cosen Iuor
Resityng these words on hye
Take hear he said
Be not dysmaide
My folks and my nauye
Pass ye into wale;
Among hills and vales
Be ye lords of that contrye
Se that no wrong
Come them emonge
For lack of nobilite
And that the Saxones
By false compaccions
Work no dishonestie
Against the Brutes
To hurt the fruits
Of their fidelity
Be constaunte and sure
Manfully endure
Your own regalytie
These words ones past
His eyes he cast
Saying lord thy will be done
In Earth us by
As in heaven hye
Far surmounting the son
Whose divine power
Is gouernoure
Of all creatid things
Be it visible
Or invisible
It is thy hand workings
And now good Lord
I will accord
Thy pleasure to fulfill
This land forsake
A new to take
Sithe it is thy will
The words once said
Mekely he obayed
Of mind will and consent
With a benynge look
His leave he took
And so to Rome he went
Wherein short space
God of his grace
By his eternal might
His solle magnyfied
Also sanctified
To his celestial sight
Now to accomplish
Also to furnyshe
My mind and intencion
Ye have hard tell
How the Angel
Made demonstration
There should a king
Floryshe and spryng
Of the same succession
By sentence divine
Of Cadwaladers line
In the fourth generacyon
Which should restore
Things past before
By his magnyficence
And for his fame
Men should him name
The prince of excellence
Whose wisdom clear
Should so apere
Through every regyon
Men should him call
For gifts natural
The second Solomon
To verifye
This mystery
With stories evident
Nature declares
The deed compares
All things equiuolente
The Last famous king
Over us rainyng
Namid the seuynth henry Henry ye vii of Cadwaladers line right full king of
Britayne called England

Was even the same
Whose princely name
Was had in such memory
Predestinate
And animate
By heavenly influence
For to fulfill
The divine will
Of the high magnyficence
Yet in his youth
Of very truth
Floryshing in years grene
In most cruellwyse
His mortal enimyes
As it was plainly seen
Did him persewe
With treason untrue
Fraundulently invented
Gave monye and hyre
His death to conspire
If fortune had consented
Supposyng thereby
The prophesy
Clean to extermynate
As god above
They would remove
His works to violate
Was not his grace
As in this case
In wonderful danger
When they conspired
And fully desired
The aid of every stranger
Put in Exile
Alack the while
So^drie ways were outsought
His lief uncertain
Being in Brytayne
Where the treason was wrought
What conspiracion
What cured treason
Or who can breuyate
Which God above
Of his divine love
Listithe to anymate
This noble Prince
For to convince
Passid there raged might
God would in nowyse
There false interpyse
Should deprive his pri^celi right
As did appear
The story clear
Of this most princely man
With spear and shilde
As Bosworthe filde
The honor there he wan
King Richrd slain
And he certain
The filde has received
Thus god above
Of very love
His kingdom has assured
For of his line
This present time
A king is discendid
With septer and croune
In City and town
Most highly commendid
Henry ye viii. son of Henry ye vii king of England, i^ whom is fulfillid the
mystery of Cadwaladers translation
I mean pardy
Most noble Henry
Called theight of that name
Whose gifts natural
Above princes all
Bears away the fame
Who can magnyfye
Or yet verefye
His condign worthynes
His amitye
Liberality
And bountiful goodness
In all affectes
To his subjects
Most graciouse and kind
In there defense
With his expense
Ready of heart and mind
Oh famous Troy
Rejoice this day
Most fortunate and good
All ye that be
As in degree
Extracte of the same blood
Give lands on hye
To god most myghtie
Which has resustitate
So noble a king
Your hertes exityng
As men most fortunate
For this is he
ye may well se
Whose bones are translated
By sentence deuyne
From Rome this time
Newly separated
Accordingly
As the prophesy
Cadwalader bones translated by seperacio^ by twene Rome and us
Before had expressed
When Cadwaladers bones
Translated were ones
All things should be redressed
God of his grace
As in this case
Has made a seperacion
Between Rome and us
Whose deeds monsterus
Were abhomynacion
There great abuses
And long mysves
Their folly and their pride
The deception
There collusion
Our king might not abide
Ye know full well
I need not tell
There great exactions
Nor how they wroughte
Kingdoms to have brought
Under there Subiections
Nether to debate
The mortal hate
Which they have conspired
In especial
To be Lords of all
Wrongfully have desired
Pretending doubteles
Much holiness
By sentence Angelical
To speak as the creed
Yet were they in deed
Uery fendes internal
There laws preferring
As concerning
The papal iurisdiccion
Whose usurped power
Would be gouernoure
Of every region
Above king or prince
Their might to convince
If they would not obaye
With Curses great
They would them threate
There honor to decay
But god most just
As I said first
Has made a seperacion
Giving our king
Grace and learning
To prefer his relygion
And not to trust
In vain hope and lust
Of man's tradicions
As though they might
(...) heaven of right
Make there conditions
To save or spill
What solle they will
Without exception
As they were divine
At season and time
By mean of there pardones
Such things abusid
Ought to be refusid
By divine ordinance
And not to trust
In things unjust
Where is non assurance
There is but one
To god alone
That is appropriate
Sins to remeue
Pardon to give
And sowles to anymate
Tradicions papal
Has brought us all
Almost to subuercyon
Having more trust
In things unjust
Then in Cristes passion
But god above
In token of love
Has us reconsiled
As it befell
In Israel
When the laws were co^mysed
To Iosia
Which of Judea
Was king and gouernoure
As in this case
Of special grace
Stood i^ gods high favor
Because he would
No body should
Do unjust reverence
To stock or stone
But in god alone
To have all confidence
He send through out
Israel about
Gods Laws to magnyfie
In especial
Commanding all
To beware of idolatry
Likewise it was
When Ezechias
The worthy famous king
Of pure intent
The Brazen serpent
The people deluding
Unto the ground
Made him rebounde
In pieces great and small
Break the hyl aulters
Of there forefathers
With their foul Idols all
Even from judea
Unto Aza
The Philystines land
Nothing would suffer
To gods displeasure
To be graven or stand
Whose constancy
God most mighty
Had in remembrance
Send his Angel
In his quarrel
Against the Assiryans
By his divine might
He flewe in one night
C.lxxx. thousand and five
From Judea
Unto Assiria
The rest home he did drive
Like wise our king
His heart referring
To gods high providence
Such things abusid
Has now confused
By heavenly influence
Which had infected
And sore detected
Christ's relygion
By shrining of bones
And kneling to stones
Made by man's inuencion
Magnyfieng them
Which were mortal men
Of nature terrestrial
With like reverence
And confidence
As to god Celestial
Whose golden shrynes
Trycked with vines
Most curiously Wroughte
With pardones plenty
Made purses empty
In sondrie places sought
Such Idols great
So richely freate
With gold pearl and stone
Lift up on hye
To magnyfye
As it were god alone
Our Josias
Our Ezechias
By permyssion divine
In this effect
Most circumspecte
Beholding this present time
Has brought to pass
Like as it was
In time of Isarell
Trusting in one
In god alone
According to the gospel
For sacrifice
In such a wise
To god only is dew
There is no other
Faith to recover
But only through Jesus
O Lord our god
Withdraw thy rod
Correct us not in thy Ire
By thou petiouse
Lord unto us
We humbly the desire
Thy ears inclyne
This present time
Harken to our clamoure
As it befell
In Israel
In the time of there doloure
Be merciful Lord
Let pytie accord
With thy bountyfull grace
Our sins remeue
Pardon forgive
Our folly and trespass
To magnify
Such Idolatry
Lord we knowledge our offense
Against thy law
For to withdraw
From thy magnificence
To have a trust
Or yet a lust
In any graven picture
Which thou defendest
Also commaundyst
To bow to no figure
This lord most mighty
We know assuredly
By thy deuyne insence
To the deity
Of thy magestie
Belongith all reverence
As concerning
The true meaning
Of our salvation
There is but one
That suffered alone
For our redemption
Our in ward faith
As saint Paul says
Should be in Christ Jesus
Let this be graued
We are not sauid
But only by his virtue
Nether yet rectified
By saints sanctified
In any manner case
Save there good living
Example giving
To follow the same trace
Of truethe our techers
Also our preachers
Which were in time long past
Took full great pain
And all in vain
There labor spent in wast
Leuing the epistell
Also the gospel
Most Evangelical
Treting of pardones
With inuencions
And Cerimones papal
But our famous king
Right well perseuing
The great ingratitude
The sencis pure
Of holy Scripture
Hyd from the multitude
For our redres
Of his goodness
With most princely courage
Has devised
Also comysed
Our conscience to discharge
Set out at long
Our vulger tongue
The scripture for to know
The seed the grain
The verite plain
Our faith only to show
It is consonant
Not repugnaunt
To gods divine ordinance
But allmen should
Who ever would
For there own assurance
Labor the scripture
His life to assure
The commandments to keep
Though sone repine
And determyne
Affrming it unmeet
That we lay men
Should labor our pen
Or scripture behold
More then the clergy
Should us specifye
By Authority toolde
Provided in this
No man there is
Being of leude lernyng
Shall interprise
In any wise
Unto the expounding
Oh noble Henry
Of Kings most worthy
Doubteles to be magnyfied
Gods own chosen knight
By whose divine might
All things are rectified
Our faith stablyshe
Errors abolishid
The gospel set out at large
Nothing is hyd
Where of is need
Our conscience to discharge
O blessed lord
To us accord
We humblye the desire
As in this case
Of special grace
Who ever will conspire
Against our king
In hindering
Of honor this his reame
There faulse intent
Lord thou will prevent
Aduoyding the dangere clean
Let not our enimyes
In any wise
Against us lord prevail
Confuse there ire
Burning as fire
In there malice let them quayle
Like as it was
When Ezechias
With humble peticion
Made his complaynt
Of very constraynt
And hertie affection
To thy deity
That of thy pity
Thou woldist thy power exte^d
Against the furies
Of his enimyes
His kingdom to defend
Lord incontinent
Thy Angel thou sent
His wooes to redres
The Assirianes plain
Lay ded and slain
Through thy mightifulnes
So in like case
Of thy divine grace
Preserve our famous king
Our enymies withstand
And save this land
Our god everlasting
Come furthe ye brutes
The seed the fruits
Of mighty Sirapys
In Egipte stalled
A god there called
In the City Memphis
Where he is deified
Also stellified
After the pagan guyse
With his wife Isis
The mighty gods
So callid in Likewise
Of whose success
Came hercules
The famous Champion
And so to convey
Down unto Troy
With all there succession
Considre then
Ye gentle welshemen
How god for you has wrough
Even the same time
That very line
To you again has brought
For this is he
Whose majesty
All things has redressed
Assuredly
As the Prophesi
Before had expressid
Was there ever king
So much tendering
Your wealth to advance
Or for your sake
Such pains did take
With so assured constaunce
Ye know pardie
As well as I
What he has devised
Only for you
Statutes made new
And laws wholly commysed
To that intent
You should assent
To your ciuilite
One law one love
One God above
And one prencely magestie
Your selves indeuore
Wholly to gether
With perfect assurance
With us to pray
These words to say
With inward affyaunce
God most gloryouse
Lord Christ Jesus
Our hope and our assistence
Our mediatoure
Our gouernoure
And our hertes confidence
Preserve our King
His grace sending
Honor and victori
Good Life and long
Here us among
With health of his body
And afterward
Young Prince Edward
To supply his regalle place
With like wisdom
As had Solomon
In every manner case
Most gracious lord
To us accord
Of thy bountyfull goodness
Thy power extend
Our prince defend
As thou did young Ioas
Which did inclyne
By grace divine
To thy magnyficence
In his years grene
As it was seen
By heavenly influence
Of very truethe
His tender youth
The laws to fortyfye
The house af Ball
With his ydolles all
Distroyed utterly
His graven pictures
His golden figures
Most curyously wroughte
Beaton to doust
His temple unjust
Prosterate down he brought
Thus let our Prince
Utterly conuynce
All false Idolatrye
Thy laws supporte
Our hertes to comfort
Thy name to gloryfye
Let not Babylon
Have dominion
Over us for thy pity
Defend us lord god
From ye cruel rode
Of their captivity
Let our prince furnishe
And fully fynyshe
What his father has begone
As was devised
Sometime comysed
To Solomon dauides son
And so at length
With bodily strength
Lord you will him advance
Hable to withstand
With myghtie hand
His enemies puissaunce
As had hercules
Of whose noblenes
Doubtless he is descendyd
As auctors old
By stories told
Famousely have commendid
Hear may ye se
That welshmen be
Of right noble dyscent
It does appear
By stories clear
And mattier evident
Who may compare
Or further declare
By any prescription
Account the parentyne
Also the feminyne
With there procreacion
To be more worthy
Being creatures earthlye
And of nature terrestrial
Seth Noye his flod
Always there blood
Has byne imperial
Here to digress
I must confess
More matter in substance
Which now I find
Long out of mind
For lack of remembrance
Of noble Hercules
The son of Osires
Most myghtie champion
Whose incomperablenesse
Excellyth doubtless
All natural reason
Non may be comparid
Nether yet declared
Unto thy excellence
Account stories all
None shall be equal
With thy magnifycence
This was that Hercules
That noble poets
So highlye does commend
And not Hercules
Called Alcydes
Which the greeks do pretend
To be so mighty
Having victory
In the fruntes of Archadie
Son of Jupiter
His name to prefer
Borne of fair Alannena
But Diodorus
Also Birosus
The chaldie affirms plain
That this hercules
Named Alcides
Was the last of the twain
But Hercules Aegipcius
Named Libicus
As saint Jerome writes
In the.x. of Genesis
Was son of Osiris
As he plainly affirms
Which did interpryse
In most knightly wise
The.xii. notable labors
Dis^orus Secalus
Also writyth thus
Whith other famous auctours
That this hercules
By his nobleness
In the woods of Nemia
Slew the great Lion
For like occasion
The serpent called Nidra
Which lay of long time
By force of rauyne
In the fennes of Lerna
Also the bore
Devouring the stoore
In the Land of Archadia
By violent strength
Caught him at length
In spite of Erimanthus
Upon his sholders square
He did him bear
To the king Euresthius
Like wise did prevail
In strength of battle
Against a great number
Called Centauries
Half men half horses
Which semyd to be a wonder
The fyfthe industry
By swiftnes of body
His person aduancyng
Caught the great heart
Whose horns by art
Were gilte for his runnyng
Also Simphalides
Birds of cruel lyknes
Consumyd the fruits bare
Like fendes infernal
For a memoryall
He le^l not one to spare
The seventh wonder was
How he could bring to pas
The clansing of Angeus hall
So noble a river
For to deceuer
Whith ^ingo poc^es didcal
The eight was the bull
The lee at the full
Out of Crete into greece
How he should bring
By see swymyng
And yet deface no piece
Diomedes
All mercyles
His rigor to accomplish
His horses plain
He fed certain
Only with man's flesh
Till Hercules
Took Diomedes
His cruelty to abate
Made those horses great
His flesh to eat
Regarding not his estate
Which he before
Had kept in score
Full wild and monsterus
To his great fame
He made them tame
Gave them to Enristhens
Then into Spain
He took the pain
Gereon to subdewe
Of very dispite
Him to acquyte
His sons twain there he slew
After to hell
As poets do tell
Down he is descended
Where Theseus
And Pirithus
He shortly defendid
Them to discharge
Setting at large
From all danger and pain
Brought Cerberg bound
Which was the hell hounde
Lincked fast in a chain
The twelueth and the last
Accompting them paste
Of this most princely man
When his noblenes
From Hesperides
The golden Apples wan
Slew the dragon
Which did enuiron
The gardayne round about
Whose look odible
Was so terrible
All men of him had doubt
Thus in knightly wise
He did interpryse
To his Eternal fame
None so worthy
Of memory
To have praise laud or name
Of this Hercules
In knightho depereles
With noble Galathee
The only daughter
Of great Jupiter
Named also Selce
Came the famous blood
Alter Noe his flode
To the troyanes lineage
Down by descent
Princes excellent
With all there parentage
Who was more worthy
Stronger of body
Then was Ector of Troy
If Stories be true
A thousand he slew
Of Greeks in one day
Of this Hercules
Came Olimpiades
The famous mighty queen
Mother to Alexander
The great conqueror
In her tender years grene
Caesar Julius
Most victorius
His enymies to confound
Came of Eneas
Which so noble was
Among the Romans found
Also Constantyne
Son of saint Elene
Of the same succession
Borne in this land
The holy cross found
By divine inspiracion
This noble Emperor
Was hole gouernoure
Monarch and president
Of every region
Throughout Cristendome
From the Est to the occident
Called by grace
To that high place
By heavenly influence
Of heart most constaunt
Slew the Tyrant
Which named was Maxence
A thousand mo
I could also
Uerefy and expres
Of the same blod
Princes right good
Full of all noblenes
But now a end
I do intend
My leave of you to take
Desiring this
All thing amys
To pardon for my sake
I must be breue
Least that repreue
Accuse me and my pen
And thus to you
I say a diewe
Fare well ye gentel welshmen
FINIS.
The aucthoure.
Most gentle reder
This litell vulgre
In my full humble wise
I you desire
Hertely require
That ye will not despise
Nether yet disdain
This little pain
Uoyd of presumpcio^
Lately set out
There is no doubt
Equal of affeccion
Let your pha^tacie
Judge me honestly
As one unreproved
Thyncke not that I
Of flattery
Herin should be mould
Of consience
No feigned sense
Have I here prete^did
Nor nothing told
But aucthours old
Before have co^me^ded
I do confess
The rude grosnesse
Of my remembrance
Not vigilaunt
Or consonaunt
To other men's vtterau^ce
For to expres
The worthiness
Of so Ancient men
But that good will
Mouith me still
To occupy my pen,
My english rude
Of gratitude
I trust ye will excuse
And not disdain
My sentence plain
Or causles it refuse
The Musis nine
Did far declyne
Where I was nutriefied
There dulcet well
No taste nor smell
In me was rectified.
Wherefore I must
In Chaff and dust
Mi self labor and toil
Give the^ ye price
Whose sentence wise
With terms can trick and file
Go barberouse book, Rusticall and rude
Full unworthy thanks for to have
Oneles of benyng gratitude
Gentell report listithe the to save.
Nether art thou pure, sincer, or grave
Confess thy fault, Blushe out for shame
Thy wits are past^hy, terms out of fram.
