Charles. etc.
First as touching the Lutherayn sect and other reproved sects / that our
ordynau^ces contained i^ our last lettres of placarde given the.xiiii. day of
Octobre / the year of our Lord.M.v.L.xxix. upon the abusyng of our holy
catholyke faith / and auoydyng the peruers sect of Martyn Luther and other

said countrees here assembled with us to be observed / kept / and maynteyned
according to their form and tenoure and that the penalyties therein declared
and put to the offender to be really and rygorously executed without remyssyon
/ dyssymulacyon or delay. And to the end that none shall pretend ygnouraunce
/ we have wylled and ordained our said ordynaunces to be publysshed through all
our said countrees and lordshyppes (in these costs) within all places where as
Proclamacions ben wont to be done the.xv. day of the next month of Nouembre.
And fro that time every.vi. month till by us be otherwise ordained.

And as touching the act of Coins and money / we do ordeyne that the

And for remedy to be had in abusyo^s procedynge of the dyuersyte of the
customs of our said countrees / and to the inco^uenyences that by them daily
ensue in so much as oftentimes diverse pure customs contrary in one country
be sustained and veryfyed by diverse practycyens. And by the said means many
of our subgectes do lose their right to the great dysprofyte of the common
welthe.

The defaute whereof is that the said customs be not approved and remaining in
writing. We have therefore ordained that the customs of all our countries in
these costs within.vi. months ensuynge shallbe put in writing by the
officers and men of law in all the towns of our said countrees great and
small And each of the same for the said towns / their sheryffes or bayllyes /

subgectes in that behalf.

Notaryes or commyn writers: some of them by symplenesse and ygnoraunce / and
other by delyberate deed to the great hynderau^ce and loss of our subgectes /
and of the co^myn welthe. We have therefore enacted that from hensforth none
shall be admytted in to that towme / but well learned men and of good fame / and
such as by examynacyon of the cheyfe men of our prouyncyall counseyl and Iuges
of every country shall be found expert / able / and suffycye^t / and

Iuges. And the said act by the said notaryes (or they may excercyse the
said town) shall be bound to leave in the court rolls of the said counseyll
and to pay for every act only.x. grotes of flaundres / and upon pain
arbytrary that none of both parties pay or take more then the said.x. grotes

marchaundyses in diverse manners. And to pouruey against the unlawful bargaynes
that many do / for their synguler profit / to the great hynderaunce of good
and faithful merchants our subgectes and other conuersaunte in our countrees
here about and of the co^myn welthe. We of our sentence and absolute power
has enacted for ever yt no College of merchants of these parties nor
strangers of any felawshyp / their brokers / legers / helpers / nor likewise
artificers nor other of what soever vacacyon faculte he be of / meddle to make
statute / ordinance or couencyon tendynge engratyng or monopole to make
bargaynes contractes or pactyons unlawfully / To have secret knowleges / as
byenge all one sort of ware or marchau^dyse / and keep it under them. And by
that means to put and keep other that have need thereof in necessyte / and
constrayne them to bye the said wares at an excessyfe and unreasonable price /
at the pleasure of the said regratours / and we defend and forbid them and
all other to make and practyke all other like dampnable and peruycyous pactyons
/ contractes and abusyons to the damage of the co^myn wealth / upon pain of
banysshement and confyscacyon of goods / countrees and places / or
confyscacyon of place / and other arbytraryly according to theffect of the
mysdede. And we forbid all iuges / officers / and to all our lyege men and
lawyers / and all other of our said countries: and to all them having or
pretending auctoryte to ordain / enacte / conferme / or make any such
puycyons and unreasonable statutes concerning such monopole. Co^maundyng them
expressly that if any such statutes com before them to be broken and abolysshed
And of our part we have declared and do declare them none and of no valor.

countrees of vytaylles as we understand proceeds of engratynges that been used
and done to the great hurtes and hynderaunce of our subgectes and specially of

our countrees yt each of them in his rowme respectyuely and within.iii.

conueyaunce of their fraud and deceyte. And all the above named and each of
them we have pryuatyd fro the frau^chyse / surete / and lyberte of all towns /
boroughes / and other places pryuyleged with fraunchyse. Also we ordeyne that
the said bankeroutes: their helpers and assystentes above declared yt shall be
found and known for such that for refuge do redrawe them in towns /
boroughes or other priuyleged places what soever none except yt their goods
by them thither brought or caused to be had thither to be taken out without

abusyo^s ensues because they give them self to idleness / which is

though that they be young and lusty of body yet withdraw they by great
importunyte that that should be dealt otherwise to aeged / sick / impotent / and
