To the most honorable Assembly of the Commons house of Parliament.
The humble Petition of the Felt-makers in and near London,
Most humbly showing,
THat his Majesty by his Proclamation dated 2. December. An. 11. Iacobi, did
straightly prohibit all persons from thenceforth to vnship, discharge, or lay
on la^d in England or in Wales any Felts, Hats, or Caps, wrought or half
wrought in any part beyond the seas, And did thereby command all his Customers
and Officers of his Ports to forbear to take any entries of the same.

That there are nevertheless great numbers of Felts and Hats made beyond the
seas, which are daily brought by strangers into this Realm, and put to sale in
this Kingdom, in contempt of his Majesty's said Proclamation and prohibition.

The petitioners further show, that by reason of the permission of the
importation into this Realm of the said manufacture of Felts and Hats ready
wrought; and for that there is no prohibition against the buying of the same in
this kingdom, infinite numbers of people are thereby employed and relieved
beyond the seas, and contrariwise many thousands of his Majesty's poor
subjects which were accustomed to be employed and set on work by the
Felt-makers of this Realm, in carding, basenning, felting, dressing, pouncing,
blocking and dying, with certain other feats concerning Felt-making, are now
utterly undone, and many of them (for want of employment) are fallen to
idleness, begging, and betake themselves to other evil courses, to the great
scandal of the government of this Commonwealth.

And forasmuch (as the Petitioners conceive,) there is no Statute or Law of
this Realm in force to prevent those great mischiefs and inconveniences, They
do therefore most humbly pray, that (for the relief of so many thousands of
his Majesty's subjects) there may be some severe law made in this present
Session of Parliament as well for the prohibition of the importation into this
Realm of Felts and Hats wrought and half wrought beyond the seas, as also for
the punishment of such as shall buy the same in this kingdom.
