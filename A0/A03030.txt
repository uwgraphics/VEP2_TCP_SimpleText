TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, THOMAS Lord Coventry, Baron of Alesborough, Lord
Keeper of the Great Seal of England, and one of his Majesty's most honorable
Privy Council.
Right Honorable,
NOt in expectation of future benefits, or any thing to be received, but in a
thankful acknowledgment of former favors already conferred, do I present
these short meditations to your Lordship, and if we shall esteem of Books
(which Erasmus does) in quibus argumenti utilitas commendat eloquentiam) rather
by the matter which it does deliver, than the strength or meannesse of the style
in which it is delivered, there will not want that to commend this; it is but
short, and such as will be rather a diversion than an employment, in which you
will happily find somewhat that will please, and somewhat that will profit, so
that the time will neither seem tedious, nor the pains altogether lost; I
desire your Lordship to weigh them, not by their own worth, but by the
devotion of the Author, whom with many favors you have bound to be ever at

Your Lordships Service to command,


To the Reader,
IT is not out of desire of being known, nor out of a desire to be thought to
know, that I do commend this small tract to the world; but to take up the
room of worse thoughts in thy head, and of worse books in thy hands; it is
the work of younger years, and the fruit of idle times, not of a serious
study, and no otherwise do I publish it to view; though I am persuaded it
would conduce much to the peace of the Church, if books of this nature were
more in use; it were to be wished that inferiors would employ their time
rather in a holy meditation of those truths which are already received in the
Church, than in making themselves, or showing themselves able to defend them;
not that I would commend an ignorant devotion to any, or desire men to know
less good, but more to practice that good which they know; not turn Religion
into disputation, but turn their disputation into action, and obedience; they
shall find in the last day that it is holiness, not knowledge (I do not say
holiness without knowledge) that must bring them to Heaven; Supremo illi
judici non scripta approbanda, sed facta; not the disputer, but the doer of
Gods will shall be justified, men while they spend their time in disputing what
they should do, they too often neglect to do even those things which are
without dispute; in this book if there be little pains, yet there is no hurt,
nay, it is thy own fault if there rise not some good to thee from it, which if
thou second with practice will bring thee to an eternal good which I wish thee.

Meditations.
MAke the word of GOD the Rule, and God Himself the Pattern of all thy
actions; contemplate God and thy self; what He is, what He requires thee to
be, like him in a degree, though not a perfection; in a perfection of
sincerity, though not of degrees. Do nothing against thy word, and let thy
word be regulated by God's word; do not ill for company, nor good only for
company.

Let thy talk not be much, and that profitable: be sparing of oaths and
promises, and perform both: shun jests in holy things, and abhor lies though
in jest: speak to the capacities, but not to the humors of men; so frame thy
talk, as one that is going shortly to give an account of his words: detract
from no man but thy self, speak well of all men till thou know otherwise,
and where thou can not speak well, be silent: meditate often upon the
shortness of thy life, and be careful so to employ it, as that thou do not
make thy account long; measure the length of it as the Scripture does, by a
buble and a shadow, and a flower light and vanishing; but yet to comfort thy
self in this present state with the remembrance of the future; that if this
life which thou have be short, yet that which thou hopest for is eternal.

My life is like a bubble, but -- a blast.
At first God breathed into -- me, and I live;
And like a bubble I do daily -- waste,
And am like water powered into -- a sive:
Lord, since I am thy bubble, -- when I dye,
Like to a bubble let me ascend -- on high.
Or if you will, my life is like -- a flower,
And like a flower for a while -- I stand;
I am, and am not in another -- hour,
For I am gathered by the owners -- hand;
Since I am so, why am I so -- corrupt,
That do not know how -- soon I shall be plucked?
But of all flowers, most of all -- me thinks,
Resembled in the Marie gold -- am I;
And l^ke the Marie-gold -- that wakes and winkes
Still as it sees the Sun, am -- borne and dye;
But here is my comfort, -- with that flower, when
The Sun appears, I shall -- blow again.
Affect not to set out thy self to the World, nor to thy self; speak not
thine own praise, nor greedily hear it from others, nor too easily believe
it; spend thy time rather in pressing forward to what thou should be, than
in idely contemplating or contenting thy self with what thou art; think meanly
of thy self, and that thought will both make thee modest (for he that suspects
himself is not bold) and eager in the pursuit of that goodness or knowledge
wherein thou supposest thy self defective; be ready rather to give, than to
take an applause; and if thou art apt to think thou deservest well, check it,
with thinking how many deserve better.

Let thy thoughts be such to thy self, that if it should be suddenly asked,
what thou think on, thou might not blush to tell; stifle sin in the first
warmth and quickening, before it shape too far: a twig may be plucked up with
one hand, which the whole body cannot wag, when it is a tree; even evil
thoughts are evil, and though yet they be not, yet cherished, will spread
into evil actions.

Be not easily provoked, and easily be friends; give no occasion of exceptions
thy self, and do not easily take exceptions at others; and be ready to make
satisfaction to those that have just exceptions against thee; it is a greater
virtue to forgive one injury, than to do many courtesies; because it is harder:
and it is harder, because more against nature; for many a man will do for
another, that will not suffer for him; therefore it is a greater perfection to
be contented to suffer, than to be willing to do, unless it be to do for
those of whom we have suffered, for our enemies, which is the highest.

Affect the company of those who are abler than thy self, and desire rather to
partake of others sufficiency, than to publish thine own; in meaner company
thou may be admired more, but in this thou shall profit more: it is better
to learn wisdom from those that are wise, than to be thought wise by those
that are ignorant: be studious rather of being able, than of being so
accounted; not to pick up thy knowledge, especially thy opinions, from other
men's discourse; but with pains and industry rather to search out the knowledge
of truth thy self, than lazily to take it up from others.

In Religion examine, but not broach opinions; ever incline to Antiquity, and
suspect novelty; in middle things ever submit to the Authority thou live
under, and let the Churches opinion be thine.

Measure not equity and right by friends and profit, nor do wrong, either to
get, or to do a courtesy; not upbraid others with the kindnesses thou do for
them, nor forget the kindnesses which others do for thee: be sparing of
receiving a courtesy where it is an engagement, and of doing one where it is
dishonorable.

Be not wilful nor wavering, not change but upon good reason, not obstinate
against reason; not believe every report, not to report every thing thou
believe; not grant every thing which thou can not answer, but suspect
rather thine own insufficiency that cannot defend it, than cry down the matter
as not to be defended.

Be sparing of thy commendations, especially of thy self; commend no man
undeservedly, that is flattery; nor thy self, though never so deserving, it is
vainglory.

Do not admire or applaud what thou understandest not; do not seem to
understand where thou do not; it is better to acknowledge thy ignorance, and
learn; than falsely to profess learning, and be still ignorant.

Desire rather to do well, than to hear well; if thou can, preserve to thy
self a good report, but be ambitious only of a good conscience; do not
measure thy self by other men's reports, nor measure other men by thy self;
ask thine own heart, and not their tongues, what thou art.

Labor to reform thy self first, let other men's sins rather be the subject
of thy grief, than of thy discourse; so speak of other men's sins, as that
thou detract not from the person; and so excuse or mitigate the slip of any
person, as that thou seem not to countenance the sin.

Do not think thou art good enough, so long as thou art not known to be
otherwise, and never think thy life so good, as not to need mending.

Say nothing but what thou meanest, and promise nothing but what thou art able;
not to intend what thou speak, is to give thy heart the lie with thy tongue;
not to perform what thou promisest, is to give thy tongue the lie with thy
actions.

Do not greedily find fault in any, nor reproachfully publish it; but rather
by a hidden and oblique way to insinuate his error to him, than detractingly
to blaze it; seek not the advancement of thine own wit by another man's folly;
not always comply with the fortune, and censure him that is down, not ever
judge of things by the event, nor condemn that as unadvisedly undertaken which
succeeds ill.

Put not off devotion and the duties of Religion with want of leisure; nor the
needy, and duties of charity with want of ability; in both, though never so
straightned, thou may do somewhat, though the less; a sigh or a groan in
the one, and a cup of cold water in the other thou can not be without.

When thou promisest, think thou may be taken at thy word; be nothing in a
complement, which thou dare not stand to in earnest: as there is less sin,
so there is less wrong in denying than in not performing; to deny is at most
but a discurtesie; not to perform is an injury; for if thou denyest, he may
seek to others; if thou deceivest he fails of all; it is lawful for thee not
to promise, it is not lawful for thee to break promise.

Observe what is good in any man, and learn it; what is evil, and eschew it;
if any thing good in thy self, to be thankful for it; or evil, if evil of
punishment, to bear it; if evil of sin, to repent of it; nor deride any man's
imperfections, but thank God that they are not thine; not to scorn any friend
for an error; but be sorry that he is wrong, and be so much his friend as to
endeavor to set him right.

For a servant ever to speak well of his Master; if ill, to speak the best;
if ill to him, to impute it to his ill deserving, is a duty, yet a
commendations; to think obedience a virtue, not servitude, and that it is not
the least mastery, so far to command ones self, as to be contented to submit
to the commands of others.

Do courtesies for others as gifts, not looking for requital; receive
courtesies of others as loanes, and meaning to repay; what favors thou do
for others, to forget them; if thou receivest any, ever to remember them; not
to requite the injuries of an enemy with the like, nor the good turns of a
friend only with the like.

Speak not censoriously of thy betters, not scornefully of thy inferiors, not
vain-gloriously of thy self, not to boast of thy self that which thou never
did, nor to assume to thy self the praise of that learning and wit, which is
not thine own; not slightly and undervaluingly to speak of other men's
virtues, and not at all of their vices; not to think superciliousnesse majesty,
or a grave reservednesse wisdom, as if thou would be therefore thought
wise, because thou say little; not be a ridle which is rather to puzzle
curiosity, than to benefit society, which man was made for; and therefore be
such rather as men may make use of thee, than be troubled to know thee.

Be covetous of nothing but of doing good, and be prodigal of nothing but good
counsel; be slow in believing ill of any, but slower in speaking it.

In place of judicature, look not whose cause comes before thee, but what; and
judge even thy brother, not as a brother, but a Judge; not measure the sentence
by the relatition; not sell judgment, nor do a profitable wrong; it will never
repent thee that thou art the poorer for doing right.

Be mild to all, but know when to be severe; there is an unseasonable
meekness: I know not which is worse, to be angry unjustly, or not to be justly
angry; if by the first thou may wrong an innocent person, by the other thou
may a guilty; sometime to be silent at, is to encourage a fault; it may be a
due chiding would reform that offense which takes heart with sufferance.

Affirm not any thing out of humor, or because thou have affirmed it; it is a
greater disparagement to stand in a lie, than to recant an error; to err is
but a weakness, and the case of all; to acknowledge an error is a virtue, and
the praise but of a few; but to maintain an error is a sin, and it is a
greater offense to justify a sin, than to fall into it.

Love, but not be fond of the body; to love it is a duty, to be fond of it is
a sin; let the fare be such as may neither impair the health of it, nor the
devotion; the apparel neat, not chargeable, not mimically in, nor ridiculously
out of fashion; such as may agree with thy estate, thy years, thy profession;
not at all to invent, and slowly to take up a fashion, and that rather because
thou would not be singular, than because thou likest it, and as may show
thee willing to be constant, but not obstinate.

Let thy recreations be short and diverting, such as may rather fit thee for
business, than rob thee of time; long and tedious sports do rather take away
the stomach to serious things than whet it; he that makes recreation a
business, will think business a toil.

Submit to every fortune, and like it, not place felicity in wealth and
greatness; to be without, and yet not to want these; or to want, and yet not
desire them; to be able to manage a great estate, and to bear a mean; to like
Gods will even when it crosses thine; cheerfully to pass over crosses, yet
to take notice of them; to be patient, but not without sense; to be
sorrowful, but not without hope; not to grow great by corruption, not to grow
proud with greatness; not to grow strange to others in a high estate, or think
God so to thee, or you so to him in a mean; not to ebb and flow with thy
condition, and be either supercilious or dejected; to take the changes of this
world without any great change in thy self; he that is contented ever with
what he is, makes himself happy without a fortune.

Think of death as a thing certain, (it may be) at hand; that Physicians dye;
that Kings in this are Subjects; some like crude fruit are plucked off by
casualty, others like overripe, drop off with age; old and young, there are
graves of all sizes; to endeavor therefore rather to procure eternal life,
than to prolong this; and use means rather to sweeten death, than to defer it.

Learn not to think of the things of this world as of things of continuance;
and to use the things of this world, not as an owner, but a Steward; so thou will be neither loath to leave them, nor afraid to account for them.

Do courtesies to thy friend, not with hope to receive greater; and receive
courtesies of thy friend, as if thou had done none; think of requiting the
good which thou receivest, though thou deservest it; expect no requital of that
good which thou do, though undeserved, lest failing of what thou expectest,
thou repent of what thou have done, and losest the praise of thy goodness, by
looking after the reward of it.

Commend no man to his face, and censure no man behind his back; if thou
know any good thing of him, tell it others; if any ill, or vice, tell it
himself; so by telling others of his good parts, thou will procure for him a
good opinion; and by telling him and admonishing him of his faults, thou will
make him deserve that good opinion.

Abstain not only from ill, but from the appearance of it, lest thou hear ill
undeservedly, or do ill unawares.

Let thy discourse be neither light nor unseasonable; such as may call either
thy goodness in question, or thy judgment: if thou can not speak well, say
nothing: so if others be not bettered by thy silence, yet they shall not be
made worse by thy discourse.

Think meanly of thine own sufficiency, though others think not so; look
much upon thy defects, and little upon thy good parts; and think that thou art
short, not only of what thou oughtst, but of others; that that which thou
know, is nothing to that of which thou art ignorant; and therefore to labor
rather truly to know thy self, than to make those small parts superficially
known to others.

Scorn not to be bettered by the good example of others, and be careful not to
make others worse with thine; do nothing in which thou would not be
imitated; and imitate nothing which thou know is not fit to be done; it is a
fault to do what thou should not, it is none, to learn what thou should
do of any.

Think in the morning what thou have to do this day, and at night what thou
have done; and do nothing upon which thou may not boldly ask Gods
blessing; nor (as near as thou can) nothing for which thou shall need to ask
his pardon; let thy first care be, not to do ill; thy next care to repent of
it; account often with thy self, thy last account will be the less, be not
afraid to look upon thy score, but be afraid to increase it; to despair
because thou art sinful, is to be worse, because thou have been so bad.

Be thy life like his that must
Account, and has it but in trust;
Let the actions of thy youth,
Answer not the times, but truth;
Let thy words be modest, few,
Thy opinions firm, not new;
Thy mirth plausible, not vain,
Not abusive, not profane;
Live not only to the eye,
Sin is sin, though none be by;
Witnesses do only prove,
Not make guilty; and true love
Of virtue, more esteems in ought
So to be, than to be thought;
It Is weakness to eschew the scarre,
Not the ulcer, and prefer
Esteem to truth; deeds must be
Such as God approves, not we;
Be in private what you seem
In public view; and not deem
All things lawful, that are hid,
Not what is seen, but what is forbid,
-- is unjust;
And only what we may we must.
Be not wicked with advantage, nor be drawn to do a gainefull sin; not
think that godly which is gainefull, but think that gain enough which is with
godliness; he that makes his commodity the measure of his actions, for a
morsel of bread that man will transgress.

Ever learn to be ever contented with what thou have, in as much as there is
nothing which by the appointment of God does not happen unto thee; and to
dislike what God does, is to do what God dislikes; and make that a sin, which
was before but a punishment, and, as it might have been used, a blessing; to
find fault with God, is to make a fault in our selves; that which God does may
be harsh, it cannot be unjust; or if that state which thou have be bad, yet
that which thou hopest for, is better.

Think not well of thy self, though others think so; yet to give no occasion
to any to think otherwise, and give the glory of both to God, both of thy good
parts, and their good opinion.

Every morning take leave of the things of this World, as thinking thou may
part with them before night, and every night to examine the employment of that
day, as thinking thou may account for it before morning; he that is ever
providing for his going, will less increase his account by tarrying; we do not
commend his providence, that has his furniture to buy when he should take
horse.

Make not a neighbors fault greater to men than it is, nor thine own less to
God; to excuse thine own sin, is to double it; detractingly to aggravate
another fault, is to make it thine own.

Busy not thy self in searching into other men's lives; the errors of thine
own are more than thou can answer for; it more concerns thee to mend one
fault in thy self, than to find out a thousand in others.

Be careful not to fall into sin, being fallen, not to lie in it; being
surprised, not to stand in it; confession is some part of satisfaction; by
denying a little sin, thou make it great, by truly confessing a great sin to
GOD, thou make it none.

If thou have lived long, think thou have the longer account, think thou have
had the longer time to provide for thy account, and therefore have the greater
sin, if unprovided; where GOD forbeares a great while, he expects a greater
increase; as where men give long day, they expect larger payment.

Perform not the things of Religion, either out of vainglory, or custom,
since the goodness of these is not measured by what is done, but by what mind
we do it with; Cursed be he that does the work of the Lord negligently; there
is that curse upon negligent doing, which upon unwilling leaving of it undone,
is not; there is little difference between not doing what thou should, and
not doing it as thou should; to do thy duty for show only, or in show only,
is to do thy duty, and be still undutiful; if that which thou do be right,
if the mind with which thou do it be not so, al is wrong, and thou forfeitst
the acceptance of what was good, by the ill performance.

Two things do not trouble thy self to know, other men's faults, nor other men's
estates; the estate of thine own soul, and the amendment of thine own
faults, let that be thy study; not think any sin less because it is hid;
remember that to him that shall judge thee it is open, and that in the last day
God will not measure his judgment by ours, the day of judgment will condemn
many a man whom we have quitted.

Do not practice Religion in show only, yet show it in thy practice; think no
sin little; nor no good which thou do great, it is from the acceptance of
God that it is good at all; hope for, but not challeng a reward of thy well
doing, yet not for it self, but for what Christ has done; measure thy self
not by what others are, but by what thou ought to be; remember thy sins
with grief, and thy goodness, the one, for that thou have been so bad, the
other, that thou can be no better; and though thou can not attain to
perfection on earth, yet aim at it.

Labor not only to know what thou should be (that most men do) but to be
so; nor at all to know what other men are; thou shall not answer for it; be
careful, if thou can, to make others better by thy good counsel, or at
least, not to make them worse by thy example.

Be ever contented with thy present estate, but, if thou can, better it; do
not corruptly thrust thy self into any place; and being in, do nothing that
may thrust thee out; make the execution of thy office, a discharge of thy
conscience, not an improvement of thy estate; and desire any place rather to
do good, than to grow rich; give no bribes to procure an unjust thing, nor
take none to do one; and if thou art in the place of judicature, remember thy
office is to give sentence, but not sell it.

Do not make any sin less by custom; for as men do at first less like
sin, so with continuance they do less feel it; as those that are
accustomed to carry burdens, are less sensible of the weight; and if thou
do now the same things with more ease, do not think that the sin is more
light, but that thou art more hardened; and thy case is so much more desperate,
by how much want of sense is nearer to death, than pain; feeling is an
argument of life, thou art a dead member if thou have lost thy feeling; but
here is the misery, that thou have lost thy feeling in regard of sin, but not of
punishment.

Fix thy desires upon such things as may not shame thee in the obtaining; and
compass thy desires by such means as may not shame thee to own; though that
which thou seek for be good, yet while the way by which thou seek for it
is evil, thou shamest the end by the way; and shamest thy self in the end.

Think no sin little, and make it not great by iteration; what is a Mountain
of earth, but an accumulation of many little dusts? What is a flood, but a
concurrence of many little drops; a little prick being neglected, may fester to
a Gangroin; by how much that in which thou sinnest is less, by so much thy sin
is the greater, that would dishonor God for so little a thing.

Think of death as a thing thou must meet with; and of thy life, as a thing
thou must part with; and not to love too well that life, that keeps thee from
a better; nor at al to fear that death that leads thee to a better life; this
life is a journey, and the world an uneasy horse, that with much jolting, and
some falls, brings you to your home, and why art thou unwilling to alight; love
rather that passage that leads to eternal happiness, than that life which
keeps thee from it, and not without continual misery.

Study rather to make thy self fit for any employment and place, than to
think thy self so; and be preferred by thy desert, not by purchase; slip no
lawful means to do thy self good, and use no unlawful; he which grows
great by buying, does likely continue that greatness by selling.

Measure thy wealth by thy mind, not by thy estate; a contented mind is ever
rich; but measure thy expense by thy estate, not by thy mind; not what thou
would do, but what thou art able to do; think not frugality a
disparagement, nor outrun thy self to keep pace with others; this is to
procure that which thou fear; and lest thou should be thought mean, to
become so; many times a slow pace performs that journey, whilst galloping
tyres by the way.

Let thy thoughts be such to thy self, as thou art ashamed to have God know
them; and thy words such to God, as thou art not afraid to have men hear them;
and let thy whole life be such toward God and Man, as that thou neither
dishonor God by thy il life, nor draw others to the same dishonor of him by
thy ill example.

Pleasure not thy self by wronging others; nor with the unjust Steward, make
thee friends with other men's moneys; left while thou would buy other
friends, thou fell GOD; come^ to promotio^, if thou can by friends, not by
money; if thou deservest it not, thou wrongest others; if thou do deserve it,
thou wrongest thy self.

The goodness of the mind, is witnessed in the outward actions; the goodness
of the outward actions, is determined by the intention and mind; inward
goodness without outward shows of it, is like a Tree without fruit, useless;
and outward shows of goodness without inward sincerity, is like a Tree
without heart, livelesse; that thou art good inwardly in thy heart, is thine
own comfort; that thou do outwardly prosesse this goodness in thy life, is
others benefit; thou thy self are not the better for that goodness which thou
do not make show of, others are not the better for that goodness of which thou
make no show; so inward sincerity is required in respect of God, outward
profession only in respect of men; by the first thou art a true Christian; by
the other it does appear that thou art so.

Neither undertake much, nor talk much, and that to the purpose; deliver thy
mind rather in profitable language, than curious; by this, happily, thou will
gain more applause, but by the other thou will do more good, and it is a
greater virtue to do well, than to hear well.

Do nothing which thou disallowest; disallow thy self some things which thou
may do, but nothing which thou oughtst to do; give no liberty to thy self
in unlawful things; use not the utmost of that liberty which is given thee in
other things; and so use thy liberty in what thou art permitted, as that they
may not hinder thee in the things thou art commanded.

Promise nothing which may prejudice thee in the performance; perform what
thou have promised, though to thy prejudice; think thy self bound by thy
word, though without oath or witness; if thou art not well able to perform,
consider thou were able not to promise; a good man measurs his promises by his
ability, but he measures his performance by his promise.

Account it the greatest knowledge truly to know thy self; and the greatest
conquest to subdue thy self; not give way to thine own lusts; nor boast of
thine own parts; to do nothing that is ill, nor vain gloriously to tell of
what thou do well; in all things to approve thy self a good man and a
Christian, but not boast of it.

Place not Religion in talk only; it is an easier matter to give counsel,
than to follow it; sometimes we have known men to fall into those sins from
which they have with great pains converted others; but Christianity (as we say
of Charity) begins at home; it was Christ's to S. Peter, Art thou converted?
strengthen the brethren, but first be converted himself; he may happily save
others that is not saved himself, yet he will sooner save another that goes in
the way of salvation himself; good doctrine is weakened much with ill life; he
that will do good upon others, must first be good himself.

Speak nothing which thou would wish to recall; and do nothing which thou
shall need to repent; condemn nothing in a humor; nor maintain nothing out
of fashion; never defend a false cause, either to revenge a wrong, or to do a
pleasure.

Think only the present time thine, for that which is past is none of thine;
and that which is to come, it is a question whether ever it shall be thine; so
the certain time of thy life is very little, and the account which thou shall
certainly give of this life very great; and thy account is made greater by
tarrying, but thy life less; so that to put off the finishing of this account
till a farther time, is to make thy self a greater account, and have less
time to do it in; nay, thou shall answer for the neglect of that time wherein
it might have been done, and it may be denied another time to do it.

Measure not goodness by good works only: a Parrat may be taught to speak
well; good words cost us nothing; and men are for that Religion that is
cheapest; it is an easy matter to speak like a Christian; Satan himself can
talk Scripture; Charity consists not barely in knowing, or discoursing of what
is good, but in practicing what we do know; in Religion not to do as thou
say, is to unsay thy Religion in thy deeds.

Ever expect death, though not wish for it; let thy last hour find thee
rather willing to go, than contented to tarry; put not off amendment till
another day, thou art not sure to see an end of this; provide that thy death
bed may rather find thee fitted for God, than fit thee; and so order thy
estate, and thy soul in thy health, that when death comes, thou may have
nothing to do but to dye.

In point of reformation, first pluck out thy own More; spend not thy time in
exhorting others to the keeping of the Commandments, and break them thy
self; measure not thy goodness by another want of it; nor measure thy want of
goodness by others store of it; God does not so: though thou art not so good
as the best, yet while thou endeavour'st to be so, thou art good enough; God
who works in us both to will and to do, does in some case accept the will for
the deed.

Reckon nothing which thou have, thine own; nor nothing which thou do, at
thine own disposing; and use all, not as a Master, but a servant, remembering
thou must one day answer for them to their Master.

Do not murmr at thy condition, if mean; nor measure Gods blessings by thy
wants, but by thy deserts; if God be better to others than he is to thee, yet
while he is better to thee than thou deservest, he is good enough.

In Christianity, not think to attain the end, without the means; and if the
same means do not in all produce the same effect, not to impute it to any
alteration or deficiency in the means, but in the subject; the means is the
same, the parties are not; all men are not alike hardened in sin, therefore all
are not alikehard, or easy to be converted; sins are compared to diseases; all
diseases are not mortal, some humors spend themselves, others are not
recovered, but with expense and danger; and the same sickness is not removed
with the same ease in all bodies, because there is not in all the same temper;
that physic does but stir the humor in some bodies, which in others would
utterly expel it; it is with the sickness of the soul, as of the body, al
sins are not equal; all men are not equally sinful; either the sins may be
less, or of less continuance; for custom, as it begets a greater liking of
sin, so it leaves a deeper root; continuation of things makes them partly
natural, therefore we call custom another nature; settled impieties, like
settled humors, do not easily stir; though the means are the same, yet while
the subject is no^, it is no wonder that the effects are not; there must be the
same disposition of the matter, as well as of the agent; it is not enough that
the word be the same, if the hearers be not; as the same physic does not work
or cure alike, nor the same seed thrive alike in all grounds, so neither does
the same word save alike, or prevail alike with all. Sodom would have
repented with those means which CoraZin did not; in thine impenitency therefore
not to accuse God or the means, but thine own self; in thy conversion, not
to thank thy ownselfe, or the means, but God, and the means under God.

Remember that as there is one death which thou must prepare to meet, so there
is another death which thou must study to avoid, the death of the soul; the
natural death consists in the dissolution of the soul from the body; the
spiritual death, in the dissolution of the soul from God: and one day, of
soul and body from God, which is the second death: now as we say of the
natural body, that the way to be young long, is to be old betimes, so the way
to live not long, but ever, is to dye betimes; if thou dye but once w^^e thou
live, the death of sin; thou sh^lt live eternally after thou art dead.

Love nothing in this world too well, no, not thy self; think of the pleasures
of this World, either as sins, or occasions of it; and the other more
necessary things of it; though they have thy presence, let them not have thy
heart; and use them, rather because thou want them, than because thou likest
them; and so provide, that thy death may be the beginning of thy happiness,
not the end of it.

Ever suspect, ever fear
For to be too happy here;
Lest in Heaven thou have less,
(If any) for this happiness;
Seldom any have I known
To have Heavens more than one;
All the pleasures of this life
They are useful, but a knife;
I may warm me by their fire,
But take heed of coming nigher;
Yet in this is danger still,
He that warmes, is after chill;
Oh JEHOVAH, but with thee,
Is there true felicity;
All this sublunary treasure
Yields but counterfeit of pleasure;
Silken cares; Kings of clouts;
Full of torments, fears, and doubts;
Trifles, dangers, baited hooks
Shadows, only shape and looks:
Of what we call the^, worse than naughts,
Snares; temptations, if not faults;
Whether it be birth, or place;
Beauty, and the pride of face;
Honor, wealth, or higher yet,
That they call a Favorite;
Like a shadow on the Sun,
Have their being, and are done,
From another like or frown;
So they rise, and so go down;
They are got and kept with fears;
And are parted with, with tears;
And accounted for with horror,
And the^ Dives is the poorer;
When that final day shall come;
(A dreadful day indeed to some)
And we answer for their use,
Then to want them we would choose;
So then, much of these to ask,
Is to beg thy self a task,
A beggary, for thus to be
Is the greatest poverty:
All thou have is on the score,
What is that but to be poor?
Add to this, it does not last;
And happiness, is torment, passed.
It may be present, so thy boast
Is but may be at the most:
In Heaven only is their bliss,
That ever shall be, ever is;
Worldly laughter is not mirth,
Borne and buried in the birth;
Where o God there wants thy grace,
Mirth is only in the face:
O God thou art, only thou,
Tomorrow, yesterday, and now;
To thee my self, my time, I give,
All that I have, all that I live.
Deliberately to move to any business is proper to man; headily to be carried
by desire, is common to beasts; in civil actions be led by thy reason, not thy
appetite; in divine actions, by Religion; and do nothing that may forfeit
either thy reason, or thy honesty; measure the goodness of things by their
lawfulness, not by their profit; nor be drawn to do ill for advantage; not
intend thy particular good, with the forfeiture of the general.

In Religion publish nothing which thou dare not stand to; nor libell against
the truth; if thou think it is not the truth, why do thou publish it? if
thou think it is the truth why art thou ashamed of it? such are between two
Rocks, either of which splits them; for either they sin in publishing that
which is a lie; or else having published it, they sin in being ashamed or
afraid to stand to it, which they think is the truth: true gold flies not the
Touchstone, a good man's actions are such as he fears not to be discovered; it
is a sign their works are ill, when they dare not own them; Oderunt lucem,
is our Saviors note of such; if it be the truth, they ought not only (in
some case) to own it, but to dye in it; if it be a lie, they ought not to live
in it, much less to give it life; every lie is a sin, but to print a lie, is
to justify a sin; and in Religion to print a lie for truth, is to father a lie
upon God; a good Man will publish nothing in God's Name, to which he dares not
set his own.

Measure not thy self by what men say of thee; they may mistake thee; it is
their sin, not thine, if others slander thee; to be ill spoken of, and
undeservedly, is neither thy fault, nor alone thy case; Christ himself was
thought a Winebibber; and S. Paul mad; if ill tongues could make men ill, good
men were in ill taking; never regard what any can say against thee, but thine
own conscience; though all the World condemn thee, while God and thy self do
not, thou art innocent enough; the wickedness of ill tongues does but dirt
themselves; the mire that is cast upon thee is not thine; care not to have ill
men speak well of thee; it may be if thou were worse, thou should hear
better; Parcit cognatis maculis similis fera; the devil does not accuse his
own; if thou were one of them they would speak more favorably; be careful to
be clean to God, what ever thou art to the world, and be slow in soyling and
blacking others; if they are not so clean as thou could wish, their foulness
be to themselves; let them be never the fouler for thy mouth; they that are
forward in censuring and accusing others, are usually such themselves.

To al thy promises need no other bond but thy word; nor no other witness but
God; be careful never to promise any thing of which thou shall wish to be
forgiven the performance; nor plead either want of ability or testimony; an
honest man does not promise more than he means; nor a wise man more than he is
able.

Be not a servant to those things which thou should command; thy money, thy
body, and thy appetite, or thy sensitive part; but use thy estate, to serve thy
body, and thy occasions; and thy body to be subservient to thy soul; and thy
soul to serve God; thus while either of these serve in their proper office,
God is served in all; if thou art commanded by the first of these, thou art
neither thine own Master, nor fit to be Gods servant.

Resolve nothing but upon good ground, nor alter thy resolution but upon good
reason; not inconstantly to waver, nor obstistinately to persevere in things;
to hear others judgments besides thine own, and if right, to submit to them;
not to think it a disparagement, that there are wiser than thy self; to think
it a fault rather to stand in an error, than to fall into one; not choose to
defend a lie, rather than descend to yield to others in that which is the
truth; to maintain an opinion because it is thine, not because it is true, is
to maintain thy self, not the truth; and to prefer thy self to the truth.

So far intend thy profit, as that thou still subject it to your religion;
not make thy commodity the stern of thy conscience; he was not the best
Disciple that had the bag; so procure or continue to thy self a place upon
earth, as that thou lose not thy place in heaven.

Learn not to examine thy self by what thou art not; as the Pharisee, not
like other men; and while some others are worse, to think thou art well enough;
we measure crooked things by that which is straight, not by that which is more
crooked; the rule of goodness is Gods Word, not other men's deeds; not to
measure the straitness of thy life, by the crookedness of another; he that
measures his beauty by another deformity, may still be unhandsom enough; if a
drunkard shall measure himself by some debauchednesse, he will seem a sober
man: in the day of judgment, God will not examine thee by what others were,
but by what thou were commanded to be.

Plead not for licentiousness of life, under liberty of conscience; as if
Christian liberty consisted in doing what they lift; or that Christ has so
freed thee from the yoke of the Law, as that thou art not still subject to the
commandments; not think that Christ was therefore obedient unto the death,
that thou should be tied to no obedience of any thing during thy life; that
the merits of our Redeemer has obtained, not that the Commandments of God
should not still be observed; but that the not sufficient observing of them,
should not be imputed.

Make not other men's sins thine by imitating the^; nor thine other men's, by
teaching of them; do nothing in which thou would not be followed; follow
nothing of which thou can not well justify the doing.

Affect not much business, especially of other men's; yet to hate idleness; to
use recreations, but not dwell in them; to affect rather what is needful, than
curious; not to overdoe; and in all these things to suffice nature, not humor
it.

Be slow in choosing a friend, but slower in changing him when thou have
chosen; be courteous to all, but inward only with a few; thou may use that
freedom to a friend, which thou will not to every acquaintance; thy
acquaintance is but thy neighbor, but thy friend is thy self.

Scorn no man for his meandness, and humor no man for his wealth; do nothing
to please any whereby thou shall displease God; never be drunk to please the
company, or think it uncivility to part sober; or cease to be a good
Christian, that thou may be thought a good companion.

Be displeased with nothing which God does, and as near as thou can, do
nothing wherewith God is displeased, do all thou do as in Gods presence,
and speak all as in his audience; and let neither thy words nor actions be
such, as to which thou may willingly desire Gods absence, or not desire his
assistance.

It is the goodness of God to us, that is the cause of the love of God to us;
and it is the goodness of God in us, that is the cause of the love of God in
us; confess that the good which thou receivest is not for thine own sake, nor
the good which thou do is not by thine own power; it is the mercy of God
that moves him to do for us; that inables us to do that which pleases him.

Account that good which is lawful, not which is profitable; and endeavor
rather to serve God than thine own turn in all; make these two the rule of thy
self, justice and godliness, and thou shall fulfill the dutys of both Tables,
God and thy neighbor.

Not repiningly to complain of thy sufferings of this life; since it is partly
in thy power to make the^ blessings; and if to make them blessings be in thy
own power, then that they are otherwise it is thy own fault; God intends
amendment in it, if it do not amend thee, thou make it a punishment, not he.

Labor to see thy own mortality in other men's deaths; and thy own frailty in
other men's sins; and since thou must shortly die, be afraid to sin; and so
order thy sins, as thou may not be afraid to die; that thy sins do not
bring thee to a worse death, and that this death may lead thee to a better life.

Do what thou art commanded, not what others do; make no man's example a rule,
not the best man's; all may err; and he that in all things follows him that
may err, will be sure in some things to fall into error.

Call to thy mind often what thou have done; and then compare with it what
thou have suffered; and what thou have received; and when thou shall find,
that thou have received more good than thou have done; and have done more evil
than thou have suffered; fear that there is less good behind for thee, and
more evil; and therefore betake thee to repentance, and a new life; and by
that thou may prevent the evil which thou have deserved to suffer, and
procure to thy self, though not deserved, a reward of that good which thou
have done.

Let it not trouble thee that some others have livd longer than thy self; not
the length of thy life, but the goodness is the measure of thy happiness; if
thou have lived well, thou have lived long enough; if thou have not lived well,
thou have lived too long.

Never think it too soon to repent, thou do not know how soon thou may
dye, and after death it is too late; he that puts off his amendment with hope
of living, loses eternal life in a presumption of this.

Intend rather the effecting of a public good, than a particular, for by
intending only thy particular good, thou may do wrong to the public,
whereas thou can not effect a public good without thine own good in
particular; for what ever is beneficial to the whole, cannot be prejudicial
to the parts; so then thou being a member of the whole in performing a general
good, even by that thou art so far good to thine own particular, as thou have
an interest in the general; whereas by seeking thy private good with the
neglect of the public, thou do both decline from the common nature of
things, and from the nature of goodness, which is by so much the more good, by
how much it is good to more, and do rather that which is good to thee, then
what is truly good in it self; this is to make thine own self and thy
advantage the rule of goodness, that should make goodness the rule of thy
self and thy actions.

Think that in death thou do not lose a life, but exchange one; death is but
a change; and therefore not to fear a change, that art every day so acquainted
with changes; every chang is a kind of death, in as much as that which it
changes from, does die to what it was; if the beasts and creatures themselves
did not change from what they are, how should we be fed? Nay, if their skins
and clothing did not change from it is natural use to them, how could it be
useful to us; if the Sun it self did not change his place; if the year, and
the parts of the year, did not change, how should we either have life or
necessaries? thou then that do thus subsist by changes, why do thou fear
a change? especially considering that other things being ever altering in
themselves, do yet ever continue alterable; whereas we changing but once, and
for the better, shall ever after remain immutable; so that to be loath to
change, is to contradict what thou do; to fear a change, and yet love a
life that is full of changes.

If God have made thee handsome, let not that make thee proud; beauty is an
ornament, do not thou make it a snare; why should thou have cause to wish
that thou had been ill favored: show nothing naked of thy self to others
but thy face, and that only that thou may be known, not seen; be courteous
to all, but no^ familiar; stay not to hear thy handsomeness praised; much
less to praise it; think no time so ill spent about thy self, as in dressing;
nor no money, as in fashions, yet in neither be ridiculous, allow for both;
acknowledge no beauty in thy self, but of the mind, nor strive for none; if
God have made thee beautiful in others eyes, let it be thy care to make thy
self so in his; beauty without grace, is the greatest deformity.

In Gods house and business forget thine own; be there as a member of the
Church, not of the Commonwealth; empty thy self of this world, thou art
conversant in the next; let al thy senses have no other object but God; let thy
ears be open, but thy eyes shut; if another beauty draw thy eyes from God,
that beauty is become thy deformity, and has turned God's eyes from thee.

Love no woman, but a wife, and use no familiarity with her, but in public;
thou know not whither it may grow; many have thought no hurt in the
beginning of those things that after have proceeded to impiety: and in all thy
behavior, examine not what thou do, but with what mind thou do it, else
that which happily in it self was indifferent, is to thee unlawful; to a good
mind, all company is safe, and all familiarity is harmless.

It Is the mind that makes a fault,
Else such things would not be naught;
He that can (and is no liar)
Sport and talk without a fire;
Can be courteous, can be kind,
And not kindle in his mind;
And can touch a woman's skin
As his own, not stir within
Does salute without delight,
And more would not, if he might,
Nor scarce that; whom thus to bill
Manners teaches, not his will:
Nor with hand, nor lip, nor eye,
Does commit adultery;
But see and salute each other
Woman, as he does his mother;
As the Nurses harmless kiss
To her child is, such is his,
Without pleasure, without taste,
With a mind, a thought as chaste
As Turtle; till thy mind be such,
Do not look, nor sport, nor touch;
Or at least till this thou can,
Sport, and talk, and play with man;
Not with woman, for if fair,
Thou will find, or make a snare;
Nay, although thy mind be such,
Do not toy, nor sport, nor touch;
For although thy thoughts be good,
Yet thoughts are not understood
But by actions; so therein
May be scandal, if not sin:
Who exactness will fulfill,
Must forbear things seeming ill,
Not that are, but might have been,
Or that may be construed sin:
Men judge thee ill or innocent,
By what is seen, not what is meant:
Then until all minds be such
Think a Look, a smile too much.
Love thy Neigbour as thy self in the kind, unfainedly; but love thy friend
as thy self in the degree; do as much as thou can, but love more than thou
can do; he that does but little for his friend, because his ability is so,
loves more, than he which does much, but less than he is able.

Revenge no injury though thou can; and require every courtesy if thou can;
yet show that thou art willing to requite a courtesy where thou art not able;
and show that thou art able to revenge a wrong (if thou can) though thou art
not willing; so by showing that thou could revenge this, thou will happily
prevent another; and by not revenging it thou will prove thy self better then
thou should; for to revenge a wrong done, is to do a wrong to God; so thou will be guilty of doing that which thou complainest of, and therefore unjustly
complainest of that which thou thy self do.

Let thy conceit of thy self be low, but thy desires high, even as high as
heaven; think thy self not worthy of the least good, yet by the grace of God
capable of the greatest: think often upon Christ's death, it will sweeten thine;
and account it his, he accounts it so; he dyed not for himself, but for thee,
and if thou live not to thy self, but to him, then he lives not for himself
neither, but for thee, to make thee partaker of eternal life, which already
thou have in the certainety, though not in the fruition, and believe all this
and more, very humbly, but very confidently.

That thou may avoid sin, avoid the occasion of it; as he that complains of
heat removes farther from the fire: omit no opportunity of doing good; and do no
evil though thou have opportunity; it is a greater commendations of thy
goodness, that thou might and would not.

Meditate often upon thy death, thou will like it the better; and often upon
the next life, thou will like this the worse; think of this World as a thing
in trust, and provide to discharge it; account nothing thine own, but as being
shortly to give an account of it to the right owner.

Be not angry without cause; be merry without offense; admit a seasonable
anger; and shun an unseasonable jest; be moderate in both; do not forget thy
self in thy anger, nor thy friend in thy mirth; by the one thou will be
burdensome to thy self, by the other to the company.

Love the body, but subordinate to the soul; the Tenant is more noble than the
House: the most beautifullest body is but a body of earth; and the Jewels which
adorn it are but stones in the earth; and the gold and silver which it prides
in, are veins in this earth; the clothes which thou wearest, were the
clothing of some beast, or the labor of some Worm, or at the best, of a man
like thy self; think then with what vile things thou art made fine; which yet
do but make thee so in the esteem of others, not truly so in thy self; and
do but hide those parts which thou art ashamed to show, not adorn that inner
part which does truly show thee; therefore to be so much a Christian to prefer
that part which thou have common with Christ in respect of his humane nature,
thy reasonable soul; or so much a man, not to prefer that part which thou
have common with the beast, an earthly body.

If thou art a Master, let thy family be awed rather by thy example, then thy
word; be angry for small faults, it will prevent greater: commend and encourage
those that do well, they will do better; commendations of former goodness is
a provocation to more.

Think upon this life as a current, ever running; do not hope to live long,
but be assured not to live still, and account it thy comfort that thou shall
one day dye; to wish thy self ever upon earth, is to wish thy self ever out
of heaven.

Be employed only in such ways as thou would not blush to be met in; Thamar
goes disguised, when to play the harlot: tell nothing of another which thou
would not have told him; believe nothing of another which thou may not
tell; do not construe seriously what is spoken but in jest, and forbear those
jests, which may be construed to earnest: hear no ill of a friend, but reply
and speak no ill, though of an enemy.

In thy house, let thy entertainment be free, not costly; bid thy friends
welcome to thy ability, not beyond it; never make one meal so, as thou must be
feign to fetch it up out of many; be hospitable, but provident; think nothing
too much for thy friends, which is not too much for thy estate; hospitality
bids thy friends welcome; and providence makes thee able to bid them welcome;
if hospitality be the life of neighborhood, providence is the life of
hospitality; he is not thy friend that expects more than thou art well able;
thou art not thine own friend if thou do less; to live above thy means is
folly; to live too far below thy means, is a disparagement; do all like thy
self, so as may neither weaken thy respect, nor thy estate.

Love not ill company, left thou learn the ill of the company; it is hard, not
to be like the company thou keep; it is rare, if we deny not Christ in
Caiphas his house; with Solomon, it is hard having the Ethiopian without her
Idols; we see people change their complexion with the Climate; Vessels smell of
the liquor they contain; by ordinary communication in the ways of sinners
without a great deal of care you will communicate with their sin; With the
froward, thou will learn frowardness; he that goes to the meetings of wicked
men, will come a wicked man out; or to say the best, worse than he went in: for
thy conversation, let this be thy rule, if thy company be better, imitate
them; if worse, convert them; if equal, and as thou art, join with them.

Feed the poor often at thy door, sometime at thy Table; whatsoever thou
give to Christ in his members, he will one day give back again to thee in
thy person; it is but just if God deny thee thy daily bread, if thou daily deny
him the crummes.

Let it not trouble thee what is talked of thee when thou art absent, more than
what will be talked of thee when thou art dead; an ill report does not make
thee an ill man; be careful to do nothing that deserves to be ill spoken of,
let it not trouble thee to be ill spoken of undeservedly.

Let thy prayers be frequent, thy wants are so; and thy thanksgivings frequent,
thy blessings are so: pray daily at home, and if thou can, at Church; God is
every where, but there he has promised to be; miss not the confession and
absolution, unless thou have no sins to confess, or carest not to be
forgiven them.

Think not the worse of the ordinances of God for the sins of the Preacher;
those that are ill themselves, may yet be instruments of good to others, God
has promised his blessing to the thing, not to the person; the sacrifices of
Elies sons were effectual for the people; it is not the peoples fault that the
Preacher is wicked, and as it is without their fault, so it is without their
prejudice; it was our blessed Saviors of the Pharisees, After their sayings
do ye; we must follow their sayings whose deeds we may not; thou may not
refuse the word of God from any, if they teach what they should, though they
do not what they teach; the wickedness of the messenger does not abate the
power of the means; as the intemperance and debauchednesse of the Physician
does not hinder the working of the physic.

Remember often that thou art a Christian, and do nothing that may disprove
it; be not a law to thy self, but be regulated by that which is a law to us
all, the word of God; study not much how to make thy life longer, but better;
consider that the longer thou art here, the longer thou art from God: let it be
thy care rather to lead a good life, than a long; endeavor to thy ability to
do well, and grieve that thou can not do better; do not wrong to others;
forgive the wrongs which others do thee; strive what thou can to keep a
good name; but rather a good conscience; if men mistake thee, comfort thy self
that God which shall reward thee, does not; look upon the necessities of
others, not as a stranger, but a member, as thou would have God look upon
thine; be good to all, God is so; but with a difference, Especially to the
household of faith; cherish no sin in thy self, and countenance none in
another; acquaint thy self rather with the commandments of God, than the
decrees; and conclude of thy salvation to thy self, rather by a diligent
observing of his revealed will, than by searching into his secret will; let not
the changes of this World, to preferment or want, make thee either fond of thy
life, or weary of it; be contented to live, but be desirous to dye, To be
dissolved, and to be with Christ; and if thou can not attain to perfection
upon earth, aim at it.

Let thy first care be to be good thy self, thy next care to make others so;
be not a Christian in show only, yet in every thing show thy self a Christian;
do nothing but what is good, and speak nothing but what is truth; he is the
best Christian that speaks well, and does as he speaks.

If thou would know who is a Christian, he
Whose holy words are seconded with deeds;
For by the fruit we must judge of the tree;
Men do not gather Grapes, or Figs of Reeds;
We judge of what he is, by what he bears;
And bear he does not only blade, but ears,
Slow to revenge a wrong, not to forgive;
Whose goodness is not only to the eye;
Thinks rather how to dye, than how to live;
And yet is dead to sin before he dye:
And who lives here on earth, and dies to sin,
When he is dead, his life does but begin.
Who does, not what he likes, but what he may;
And asks, what may I, to, not of himself,
But of Religion and the Scriptures say,
Who is his own rule, runs upon a shelfe;
Who though he might, he would not be deboise,
Is good, not of necessity, but choice.
That makes not opportunity his Bawd;
(Occasion sometimes does invite a sin)
To may and will not, is the Christians laud;
He Is guilty that is out, but would be in;
But being tempted, or but not withstood,
Not to be evil is a double good.
That can revenge a wrong, but does forbear it,
And to be slow to malice, is not sloth:
Speaks only what is truth, but will not swear it;
Nor second every trifle with an oath;
That likes no vice, though followed with a throng,
Who measures truth by voices does it wrong.
Some good he does, yet feign he would do more;
To would be better is an act of grace;
His mind is rich to Christ, his power is poor;
God mend his power, and he will mend his pace:
Mean time God likes the will, and in his Son
What we would do, is in the acceptance done.
If yet he do, (as who did never ill,
Who is without his errors?) yet is this
The error of his frailty, not his will;
He does indeed, but grieves to do amiss;
To sigh and grieve for what we cannot do,
Is to come short, and yet to do it to.
You Will say then Christianity is hard,
What good was ever easy? where the gains
Are greatest, likely there the way is barred;
Double renown is had with double pains:
Who so does follow Christ, does pitch a field,
It Is less praise not to fight, then not to yield.
Worldly advancements are not had with ease;
And want is the inheritance of sloth:
Would thou do less for Heaven then for these?
It Is fit who would have one, he should have both:
The gain with hardness, thus it is less hard;
The danger's great, but so is the reward.
Let it trouble thee more to do a fault, then to hear of it; if thou art ill
spoken of by another, first call thy self to account; before him, it may be
thou deservest it; be more sorry that it is true, than that it is known; if
false, it is not thy fault that thou art belied; it is thy comfort that it is a
lie; do not think to be ever free from censure, here, nor sometimes from
faults; he is the best man that erres seldomest, he is more than a man that
never erres.

In Religion receive no opinion upon credit, and vent none upon discontent; be
of that opinion that may save thee, rather than that may raise thee; let not
the doors of thy lips move upon the hinges of another man's tongue; speak what
thou think, not what others speak: so follow good men, as remembering they
are but men; go rather the way which you ought, than the way that is gone;
make others companions but not copies, or so far copies as they agree with
the Original.

Take whatsoever God does, thankfully; and do whatsoever he commands
cheerfully; labor to make a good use of ill accidents; hate every man's sin,
love every man's person, and love no man's sin for the persons (...).

Fear rather to do ill, than to suffer for thy ill doing; he that truly
fears sin shall never fear punishment; think upon the goodness of GOD and
thou will love him, and think upon the justice of God, and thou will fear
him, and so by consequence, love that which may free thee from this fear; and
so between these two, thou will fear to do any thing against him whom thou
love, and thou will at (least) not love to do any thing against him for
fear.

If the actions of another reflect to thy harm, examine not what is done; but
what was intended; and if he intended no ill, think he has done thee none,
though in effect he have; willingly do no wrong; wink at those wrongs that
are unwillingly done thee, GOD* does so, and measures what we do by what we
meant to do; he that shot at a mark and killed a man, by the Law of God was
not held a murderer; God that works in us both to will and to do, as he does
sometimes accept the will for the deed; so he does usually measure the deed by
the will.

Do not easily entertain a friend, nor easily part with him; think him no
true friend, whom one injury can make thine enemy; or that accounts every
error an injury; he must have no friends, that will have a friend with no
faults; make no man thine enemy by doing him wrong; become not an enemy to
every one that wrongs thee, account every man thy neighbor, though thine
enemy, that needs thee.

In Religion look to the end but by the means; think not to partake of what
God has promised, but by doing in some measure what he has commanded; though
heaven be had without our desert, yet it is not had without our pains; then
may thou hope that God will be as good as his word to thee, when thou
sincerely endeavourest to be as good as his Word commands thee to be toward
him.

Do nothing which is ill, nor every thing which is lawful; measure not thy
liberty by the lawfulness of the thing, but the expediencie; many times an
unseasonable good, though it be not ill in it self, yet it is, in the
occasion of it; he which will at no time forbear to do something which he
may, will at sometime do something which he may not.

Be content to hear of another praises before thee without repining; and to
tell of another praises without detracting; to speak well of all men, or not
at all; for as it is flattery to speak that good of another which is false; so
it is detraction, to speak that ill of another unnecessarily which is true.

Forgive the wilful injuries of any, yet tell him of them; by showing him his
fault, thou show him his duty; do not love him less for it, but trust him
less; but if he be thoroughly sorry for it, be thou thoroughly satisfied; GOD
asks no more for thine; consider that to suffer wrongs is common to thee with
Christ, and to forgive wrongs is proper to thee as a Christian; GOD does suffer
such wrongs to be, that he may exercise thy patience; and he commands thee to
forgive those wrongs, that thou may exercise thy charity.

So live as thou may not be afraid to dye, as thou may be assured of a
better life after death; do nothing which shall need an excuse, or fear a
witness, and so use this world, as remembering you must account for it in the
next.

Let thy discourse be ever of goodness, but not of thine own; or of the good
which thou have received of God, not which thou have done; if thy talk be good,
thou do at once both show goodness, and teach it.

Be good without much noise; be provident without perplexedness; be merry
without lightness; be bountiful without waste; live to the benefit of all,
but to the service only of GOD.

If now thou art not perfect yet with these,
(As where is their perfection here below)
Yet they may do enough to make thee please,
God accepts what we can, for what we owe;
Whilst thou endeavour'st to be what thou should,
If thou want power, it is enough thou would.
The cleerest water is not free from mud;
She Sun is not exempted from ecclips;
Here our perfection is but mingled good;
And he is more than man that never slips:
In all we do, we something do amiss,
And our perfection imperfection is:
For the condition of our present plight
Is, that we would be better than we are,
Not a perfection ever but a height,
And we are good, but not without a scarre;
All things are like our selves, a mixture, then
God does not look that we should not be men.
FINIS. Gloria Deo.
