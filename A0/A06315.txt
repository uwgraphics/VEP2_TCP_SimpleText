defendor of the faith etc. The preamble.
To all to whom these presents shall come greting. Whereas we are credibly
informed, as well by our right trusty and right well-beloved Cousin and Counselor
Charles Earl of Nottingam Lord high Admiral of England, and Captain General
of our Navy Royal, as also by our principal officers of our said Navy, how
slenderly and deceiptfully, as well our own Ships and Barges, as also other
Ships, Boats, Pinnaces, and like vessels of our Merchants, and other our
subjects, used in continual service and traffic, are made and wrought, to
the great loss, danger, and prejudice of us and our said subjects, and also
of the great, needless and wastfull charge and expenses which we do from
time to time bear and sustain in building and repairing of our own Ships
and Pinnaces, which are and have been the chiefest and greatest defense of
this our Realm, from the assaults of such enemies as have practiced the
overthrow of the same: We weighing the manifould dangers, losses, and
hindrances, which might and were likely more and more to ensue thereof, if
speedy remedy be not therefore had and provided. And intending to provide for
the strengthening of these our Kingdoms and Dominions, with sufficient Shipping
for defense and service thereof. And to the intent that as well our self might
from time to time be furnished, stored, and supplied with the fittest and
ablest Ship-wrights, and worke-men for the building, making, and repairing of
our own Ships, Pinnaces, and other vessels. As also that our Merchants, and
other our subjects might also in their work and building, from time to time,
be stored and supplied with skillful, able, and sufficient Ship-wrights and
workmen. And for the better suppressing of deceiptes and abuses of diverse
persons, which should take upon, without sufficient skill and knowledge to make
or repair any Ships, Boats, Pinnaces, or other vessels, to the great danger
and hindrance, as well of our self, as of diverse other our loving subjects.

unto them by our said Charter, or Letters Pattents, diverse Preuiledges,
Liberties, and immunities, mentioned and contained in the said Letters
Pattents, tending to the reformation of the said Abuses and deceites. And
whereas diverse defects and imperfections have been: sithence by experience
found to be in the said Charter as well in the extend thereof to what persons it
should extend, As also in the want of sufficient authority and means to
govern and order the said Corporation and the men and members thereof, and the
affairs of the same, and the Shipwrights, workmen, apprentices and servants
using the said art, and for want of power and means to reform, prevent, order
and correct many contempts, misdemeanors, deceits, and offenses in the said art
or mystery, and the matters and things thereunto appertaining, and to punish
stubborn, obstinate, and disobedient persons of that profession, whereby
manifold errors, deceits, and inconveniences are still practiced, and continued,
to the great hindrance of the Navigations of this kingdom, the often loss and
hazard of men's lives and goods, and the especial prejudice of our own service

That it shall and may be lawful to, and for all and every person and persons,
lawfully using or exercizing, or which hereafter shall lawfully use, or
exercize the said Art or Mystery, by themselves, their servants, or Deputies at
any times hereafter, to buy and provide in any the places beyond the seas, all
such timber, Plancks, Masts, Deals, Sparres, wood and wooden stuff, and also
all Pitch, Tar, Rozen, and Oil as they shall think necessary or convenient,

other matter, cause or thing to the contrary notwithstanding. And whereas for
the better mainteinance of Navigations, and encouragement of our loving
subjects, to increase shipping within this our Realm, Surueying of Tounage
there is and has bin of ancient time an allowance given by us, and our
predecessors of five shillings sterling, for every Tun of any new builded
Ship to be rated according to the burden of the said ship, so as the said ship
did contain in burden one hundred Tonnes or upwards in Tonnes and tonnage,
which laudable custom we being pleased to continue, and finding it also
convenient as well for the avoiding of abuses that might be offered in rating
and setting down the tonnage of the said ships and otherwise, as also that the
builder might have his right and due allowance of tonnage, to appoint some
person or persons of knowledge and experience, for the surueying and ouerseeing
of the true rates and tonnage in that behalf, We did by our Letters Patents
under the great Seal of England, bearing date the 24. day of April, in the
third year of our reign, give and grant to John Grent gentleman, for and
during his natural life the Office and place of Surueyour of the tonnage and
burden of all new builded Ships of the burden above mentioned or upwards,
from time to time within this our Realm of England, together with the wages
and fee of twelve pence by the day of lawful money of England, for the
exercising of the said Office or place, together with all and singular other
Fees, profits, commodities and allowances whatsoever to the same place or
Office in any wise due, incident or appertaining, with a Prouiso or clause
therein mentioned, that the said John Grent in the rating and setting down of
the tonnage and burden of the saidnew builded ships from time to time should
use the advice and assistance of one of our ship-wrights to be nominated and
appointed by our High Admiral of England for the time being, And that all and
every such bill and bills of tonnage as should be presented to us, to be signed
for the said allowance of five shillings upon every Tonne of the burden of the
said Ships should be first allowed under the hand of the said Surueyour, and
signed by the said Admiral or his deputy for the time being as has been
accustomed. And whereas by our Letters Patents, bearing date the 28. day of
January, in the fourth year of our Reign we did grant, or mention to grant
unto Humfrey Iobson gent. for and during his natural life the Reuersion of the
said Office or place of Surueyor of the tonnage and burden of all new builded
ships of the burden of one hundred Tonnes, above mentioned, or upwards from
time to time, within our Realm of England next after the death, forfaiture or
surrendor of the said John Grent, together with the wages and fee of twelve
pence a day for the exercising of the said office, place, and all, and singular
other Fees, profits, commodities and allowances whatsoever to the same place or
office in any wise due, incident or appertaining As in, and by the said two
several Letters Pattens more at large appears. And whereas of late we have
bin much wronged, defrauded, and abused, in that sundry of the said ships for
want of exact viewing, surueying, and measuring, have been ouer-rated in their
burden and tonnage, whereby we have been charged with the payment of a
greater allowance, then in truth we ought to have been. Know ye therefore,
that we reposing a special trust and confidence, in the faithfulness,
experience, care, and honest and true circumspection of the Master, Wardens and
Comminalty, of the said Art, or Mystery of Ship-wrights. And to the end, that
we, our heirs, and successors, may not at any time from henceforth, in like
sort be defrauded, wronged, or abused, do of our special grace, certain
knowledge, and mere motion, give and grant to the said Master, Wardens, and
Comminalty, and to their successors for ever, the office, function, and place
of Surueyour of the tonnage and burden, of all new builded Ships of the
burden of an hundred tonnes above mentioned or upwards from time to time,
within this our Realm of England, Together with the said wages and fee of
twelve pence by the day, and all other fees, proffits, commodities, and
allowances whatsoever, to the said office, or place in any wise due, belonging,
incident or appertaining, And them the said Master, Wardens, and comminalty and
their successors we do by these presents, for us, our heirs, and successors,
nominate, ordain, make and appoint Surueyours of the tonnage and burden of
all new builded Ships from time to time, within this our Realm of England,
and Dominion of Wales. To have, hold, exercise, and enjoy the said office,
function, and place, and also, to have, receive, and perceive, the said wages
and fee of twelve pence by the day, immediately when, and from, and after such
time, as the Estate and interest, Estates and interrests granted or mentioned
to be granted to the said John Grent, and Humfrey Iobson respectively, by
death, surrender, forfeiture, or other occasion, cause, or means whatsoener
is, are, or shall be void, ended, or determined, and whenever the said
office or place shall first happen, or become void unto the said Master,
Wardens, and Cominaltie, and to their successors for ever. And for the better
and more exact examination, judging and finding out from hence forth of the
true burden and tonnage of every Ship, and vessel, that is or shallbe capable
of, or intended to have or require the said alowance. We do hereby for us our
heirs and successors ordain, decree, grant, limit, and appoint, and also

distance, strong to carry ordnance aloft and allow with her fore-castell and
half deck close for feight. As also to cause every such Shipp and vessel to

whereof they or any of them ought to be charged, nor shall at any time be

and made for the mainteinance and increase of Navigations and for the better and
more substantial making, building and repairing of ships, and also for the

themselves, or suffer others to offend in those things, whereof they ought to
be the reformers and redressers, and at whose hands we expect to receive and
have amendment and reformation of all offenses that shall be committed by any
others in that behalf. And forasmuch as the poverty of Ship-wrights and
