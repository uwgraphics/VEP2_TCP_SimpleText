THE IESVITS PATER NOSTER.
O Mighty Phillip King Of men
we always with a faithful heart,
Confess we are thy children dear,
And eke acknowledge that thou art,
Paternoster
All Jesuits for thy worthy gifts
Which unto us from thee did spring,
Do sing this song continually
Blessed be thou O mighty King,
Qui es in coelis
Rauilliack from a cursed race
So well by us instructed first,
For massacring the King of France
Instead of being still accursed,
Sancttificetur
This blow great Phillip may declare,
We are thy friends most constantly,
And that throughout the world we will spread,
Maugre thy greatest enemy.
Nomen tuum.
Thy most immoderate desire,
Of rule and government to gain
And thy design most wonderful
Over all other Kings to reign
Adueniat.
Some men whom envy ouercomes
Do much condemn thy greedy mind
But by the right of thy desert
^
^
O puissant King of matchless power,
Whose name with reverence we adore:
What will thou have? wish, and command
Speak only this, and say no more.
fiat.
And then straight way, our holy troop
Shall strive who shall be most free-wild
To do his best without constraint
That through the world may be fulfild.
voluntas tua.
Such great attempts to undertake,
The wrath of God thou needst not fear
For we have power in our hands
To make thee even as happy here
sicut in coelis.
We have the gift of flattery
T'enchant thy foes, and under seete,
To trample them, and never cease
Till each lie wrapped in a sheet,
and in terra.
For thee our Princes we betray,
And widow Robbers are we all:
We do disturb our countries peace
And this is that which we do call
panem nostrum quotidianum.
Think nothing hard which we propose,
Many preuayles both day and night:
If thou in all things wilt abound,
And wrong done by us gain thee right
Da nobis.
There are amongst us of all sorts,
That can by treasons kings annoy,
Whereby we gather all the wealth
Which in our houses we enjoy.
Hodie.
If some say we are covetous,
O King believe not what they say:
But let thy Justice then take place,
And let them be condemned to dye.
and demitte
For they are souls of small devotion
Which Satan to himself retains,
And for to judge them Hogonotes
The knowledge thereof appertaynes
Nobis
These Politicians being believed,
Alas! from us all credit's gone:
But sure they all are Heretics
Which do divulge to every one
debita nostra.
But such as only give their mind
To pray to God both night and day,
And enemies are to Hypocrites
They are not fit in Court to stay
sicut and nos.
With Kings and Ladies we frequent
Being very watchful of their states,
And of their goods, and of their souls:
But as for poor and needy mates,
dimittimus.
Phillip show favor unto us,
We have done many a wicked action:
And sure except thou succor us
We never shall give satisfaction
debitoribus nostris.
If our designer descried be
A due all plots whereon we muse,
To live upon necessity,
Even in such sort as good men use
et ne nos induca.
The Occasion now which France presents
(Within her kingdom King being dead)
Of a young king and a Regent Queen,
Has caused our fathers to be lead
in tentationem.
Phillip thou know well that France,
Does wish us evil for thy cause:
Let not thy greatness suffer her
On us to execute her Laws,
sed libera nos.
We never yet have say led thee,
Hold it as done, whatsoever we will,
Thou oughts not to be ignorant,
That all of us are tempted still
a malo
God make thee able O great Prince,
(Following vows Jesuitical)
To make one province of the world,
and consummate thy actions all,
Amen.
THE AVE MARIA TO THE Queen of France.
WHen Judas with a kiss betrayed his Lord,
He said, all hail: the Jesuits will arise
To kill thee (as thy King) a deed abhord)
Speaking unto thee in most humble wise
Ave Maria
These banished persons which through treason drew
the dead kings tooth, with a most shameful doom
Were punished: but at length was got anew
(To draw his heart) a pardon sent from Rome
Gratia plena.
Venice has wisely from her land expeld
Traitors and Traitors wicked brood for a ye,
Discords true Tender boxes which there dweld,
Which you must also do that we may say,
Dominus tecum.
O blessed Queen if thou effect
This deed which to thy subjects hearts gives ease,
Confirming rest whereof there is such defect,
Then shall be said of her enjoying peace,
Benedicta tu
They seem most fair without, but are within
Devils incarnate, Hippocrites, Truths foe:
Their words are chaste, their deeds are Sodoms sin
And do amongst themselves as others do
In mulieribus.
If France do see (according to her vow)
Her land of Treason plotters quite made free,
Which good states by false Doctrines overthrow
With one consent the Lord shall praised be,
Et benedictus.
These Jesuits banished, truth restored is,
Faithful obeisance thereby is procurde,
It Is the repose, and Frances happy bliss,
It Is the sole means whereby may be securde
Fructus ventris tui.
This deed achieud, you to your son shall prove,
A blessed mother: who to God shall pray
That you with Christ may dwell in heaven above,
And with good hearts true subjects all shall say,
Amen.
