The Physyke Of the soul.
The diseases when with out bodies are troubled, and ye death which our b^dyes
ilyke manner must of necessite suffer, do very greatelye vex and disquiete our
minds, yea and that with no small fear and trembling: insomuche yt many times,
even at the nami^ge of the^^or when any mencio^ of them is made a^ all, we
shake and tremble for f^are. Certes, the nature of man, which had rather not to
be, the^ to be euel at ease or dysquyeted, when these euylles are at hand, can
noue otherwise, then wax pale and be sorrowful, but yet can there not chance to
man a more fearse or more horrible, or cruel misfortune, the^ ye disease of ye
soul and ye death of y^ same. But for as much as every man does dread and fle
with all haste p^ssyble the punishementes troubles dyseases, sicknesses, and
this death of the body: verily we ought much more to avoid and eschew the
causes of these euelles: I mean, sin and ungodliness, and to fear the heavy
dyspleasure of God which throw our innumerable offenses we pro^oke so many
times against us. When we be diseased ^n our body, we ru^ne streght way^s unto
a Phisycian, we spare no cost in this behalf. Nothing is to dear for the
health of our life. We lashe out our money plenteously in biynge remedies and
salues, that this earthly vessel and sheal, which notwithstanding, shall
shortly after decay, may be recovered and amended. Why do we not likewise
with a^ much study and care, couete and seek after remedies against the
diseases of the Soul? seing^ they be much more grievous, and beyond al
measure more peryllous.

What should it profyt a man, if he had all the riches of the world, lived an
whole thousand years, and enjoyed also all the most denty and fine Pelasures of
this Life, and were troubled with no pains of syknes disease or any other
myserye, if yet for all yt his soul in the mean season were infecte with the
da^pnable wyckednes and poison of sin, and being oppr^ssed with the tyranny
of satan had the displeasure of God, and after the departure of this life be
dampened for ever? Math. ^x
therefore Christ monisheth us saying, watch, for ye know not the day nor the
hour, when the Son of Man will come. And because we should not follow light
Tryf^lynge and Vile things: and despyce things which are much (...) the
most nigh, certain and suer way to come unto teue felicitee* Math. vi.
wealth joy or pleasure, when he says: seek* first the kingdom of god and ye
ryghtteousnes of it and al things shall be ^ast to you.

We take thought and turmoyle oureselues day and night to get us a living,
and to make suer our riches and such other vain and transytory things,
which lytyl help us yea, which many times also are y^ cause of most grievous
miseries, and horrible sines: but in sekyng and* prouidi^g for heavenly goods?
how sluggysh are we? how negligent? how vncircu^spect? how dastardelyke what
more horrible blindness and madness can there be / I beseech you? whyl we lyu^
wealthly and make frolycke chere we never remember the life that is to come,
nor yet the death that we (...) we (...) and red^ to dye, and wha^ we should
go to y^ battle and fight valiauntly, then a^ the last we b^gynne to think of
gettyng ar^ours and wepons against Satan and of amendyng our life. These t^inges
show evidently, yt we be very weak and slender in faith, and but a litel
exercised in the christen warefare. God have marcy on us. AMEN. And although it
be so ye every age is apt to repent and amend and yt no repentance is to late
so that it be done before the departure of this life, yet I counsel and monysh
al men even from the very heart, yt no man do prolonge and differ the act of
repentance unto this last and most bitter agony. For they also do very ^ardly
s^onde and remain* which all the time of there life / enioyyng prosperous
health, have en^rmed and Prepared them selves unto this howr of departure, and
yet defend them selfs with great labor and Busynes from the Assaults,
graftes, gulles and subt^ltes of that most cruel and crafti enemy. What shall
become than of them, which without al fear of God have led a stinckyng,
dissolut and unthrifty life, yea and that without any repentance? how, I pray
you shall they strive? hou shall the^ resyste?

^ut seeing there is in every place a great multitude of men, and for as much as
the ministers of y^ Gospel are not always in presence, nether can they give
there dyligence to al men at al times: I being greatly desirous to help al
men, have written this manner, way and form of confortyng, o^deryng and
monyshi^g ye sick, gathered out of gods word especyally for them, which as
yet are rude and not perfectly instructed with the sentences of the holy
Scripture unto such chances, y^ they either redyng these things* or hearing
these things read before them, may conceive hope and sure and true comfort,
that they despair not and peryshe in that most bitter agony and conflicte of
death.

A man therefore liyng on his bed through the grievous disease wh^^ with he is
vex^d, and being i^i^operdye of his Life, is assailed and overwhelmed with
diverse and grievous temtacions, wherewith he must fight valeauntly. But above
all, this is the most bitter and most grievous tentacyon / when ye most heavy,
displeasaunt and lotheso^ Image of death is prese ^t before owre eyes, and
when we see or consider the most cherful light of this life, and al ower
kynnesfolkes or friends, how we must forsake them and go away from them,
yea, and not (...) in this world, which be most dear and pleasant to us.
Besides this the sins also which we have committed against y^ will of god and
his co^m^u^dement, come straight ways into our mind, and brasting in with great
vyole^ce, are renewed and wax fresh, and seem manymo, yea and more heinous and
abominable, the^ they ever appeted before* and do by this means torment, vex
trouble and disquie^ the conscience wo^derf^lly. For after y^ consideratyo^ of
the ^hi^ges before said, death, ye judgment of god hell, da^pnacio^, fear and
^rembli^g, co^^locki^g together as it w^t a swarm of bees, and vex our old
man with most violent and t^oublous storms of most grievous sorrows and feats
and with most sharp and bitter engynes of sorrow and heaviness ^hey shake and
assail our breasts.

In these agonies except our breast be strengthened and made sure with great and
constant faith, it shall be ^eopardus, lest we being made weary and dashed out of
cou^tenau^ce through these grievous and mighty te^tacyons / do fall unto
desperacyo^. For those things which com unto our remembrance when we be
sick, seem unto us most horrible and most heinous, yea and that for none
other cause, than that our faith is weak and sle^der, and not as yet grown
unto such perfection, that trusti^g o^ gods word, is able to lay hand on those
exceadi^g and i^^stymable treasures and riches of the sons of god, I mean /
remyssyo^ of al our sins through christ, the resurrection of our flesh, yt
felouship of al ye elec^, so gretely to be desired and lo^ged for: to conclude,
everlasting life, and yt al these things are freely (...) for christ's sake. In
these articles of our faith should we exercise our selves daily and after that
we have dyligently weied the^ and earnestly pondred them, repose the^ i^ our
mind. We ought also often times to come unto the communion and that holy table
of the Lord, yet so ye we first prove and Examine our selves dylige^tly, lest
we vn^euere^tly handle so holy a thing: and though it be convenient at al other
times to eat y^ supper of ye lord, for our comfort: yet is it now most
necessary and we have in the time of our sykenes an vrge^t cause to do it.
Truly, it is a pytyfull thing and a thing worthy to be lamented / that now
many years this sacrament of the body and blood of Jesus Christ has been both
unworthily and vnreuerntly handled, yea of very many most extremely despited
How horrible and heinous a sin (...) punished now adays do abu^da^tly
testify: and S. Paul spoke of it before. i Cor. xi. God have mercy on us and
lighte^ the ^ies of our mind that we leaving so a^ unseemly and horrible
error, may ones repent and a^end We shall therefore of^e^ times come unto this
table with high study of godlynes and deuocyo^, that our minds being
recreated, chered and comforted with that heavenly m^ate of ye soul, faith and
charity may be ^ncreased and made strong in us. Moreover we ought alwaie
dilygentlye to remember all the articles ^f our ^atholyke faith, but in the
agonies of death four are nerest of al, with great ^iligence to be weied and
po^dred of us, yt is to say, y^ articles of ye church or congregation of
saints of remyssyon of sines by christ's blood, of the resurrection of ye
flesh, and of everlasting life.

First / as death is the pain of sine, so likewise are diseases many times
sent us of God for our sins, Joan. v. P^a vxx^ v iii Deu. xx viii^ii. Re.
xxiiii.
as it is manifest in diverse places of the scripture. we are punyshed also
oftentimes to prove and try our faith / for then is it p^rc^aued, how derely
we love god how greatly we trust unto him, when we be oppressed and troubled
with any heavy cross. Therefore look yt here before al things, thou tur^est al
thine heart al thy mind / and al thy senses unto God, and that thou do truly
repent and that thou do lament and confess thy sins before God, for the
which al we have deserved, eue^n ye most rightuous wrath of God and most
grievous p^yne. Notwithstanding, the most ple^teous comfort or absolucion, as
they call it, or remyssion of sins, which christ ordained in the church, thou
shall require of ye Gospel of John. Ion. xx.
This exceadynge great treasure is daily opened and offered to thee. Take ye,
says Christ^ the holy ghost. Whose sins ye fo^geue, ar forgeuen them, and
whose sins ye retain, are retained. Note, after that we have prayed and
obtained the forgeuenes of sins, without doubt the pain and disease and the
trouble that is laid upon us, shall cease and leave us, or else according to
the syngular good will of God, it shall turn unto the salvation of the
diseased. For believe this for an undoubted truth, that their pain or cross^
(seem it never so grievous a yoke and bur^he^ to the flesh) is a very fa^herly
rod or chastisement, wherewith god calls thee, being his son unto him, and
withdrawethe and allureth thee away from synninge. Certes, God loves us most
tenderly. He favors us, even from the very har^e, and he does all things
for this purpose even that he may amend us and do us good. For whom he
loves, he cor^ecteth and chasteneth and seourgeth him in this vale, that he
may not be tormented after this life with ye everlasting punishment of hell
fire. Neither shall thou doubt, but most certainly persuade thy self, that G^d
is thy most loving father, and m^^t entierly desires thee / although he
pretends never so greatly to be a^gry with thee* This is not ye anger of a
Tiraunt, nor of a butcher, but of a father that most de^elye louethe us, which
would not that we should be destroyed, but that we should correct our manners,
amend and obt^ine health and Salvation. This is as sure as God is in heaven /
if we had faith to believe it. Therefore first of al, ask forgeuenes and
remission of all thy sins, But in Chrstis name: But with an heart that truly
repents / that thou may be at a point with God, and that thou may have
him good, favorable and mercyful to thee. After yt also may you desire god,
that he will deliver there from the affliccion and disease / that is laid upon
thee. So teaches us Jesus y^ Son of S^^ach, Son, says he ^espyse not thy
self in thy sykenes But pray unto the Lord and he shall heal thee. Eccl:
xxxvi^i
So prays David likewise: Psalm, lxx^i^.
rem^ber not our old wickednesses: but let thy mercies soon overtake us. help
us O God ower Savior O you lord god of pou^rs turn us. how long will thou be
angry* Show us thy countenance, and we shall be safe. First he desires
remission of sins, y^ he ma^e be iustyfi^d by ye grace of god: afterward he
prays god, to turn awy his wrath And when you praiest to be delivered and
eased of the cross which do burden thee, thou shall always add this unto it:
let thy most holy and good will be don* O heavenly father, for we shall not
better provide for our selfs the^ that most trusty father will do which is of
infinyt power, ^ ysoo^ and unmeasurable goodness, which i^ no place turns away
his eyes from us which takes great care for us / which has the hears of
ower head numbered, which makes alive, quickens, norisheth, couerethe,
cherishes, saves and defends al things which aforeseeth and provides for all things much more and better / then the creatures can wysh.

There are three things, which in the agony of death do most grievously
dysquiet us and trouble our minds with great fear that is to say Sin,
Death hell or Dampnatio^.

Sin
The sins wherein we have (...) (...) ^pent our life, wherwithe also we have
most grievously offended both God and our neighbor, when we remember them
lyeng upon our bed sick, we are stricken with a wonderful fear and sorrow as
Paul says, indignacion and wrath^afflyction, Romans ii.
and grefe of mind, ^s against every soul of man that does evil.

Death.
Our old man and flesh are very loath to dye. Therefore when death is at hand,
the heart of man is troubled disquieted, and in a mane^ overthrown with such
sorrows and thought ^akynge, as no tunge can express. For fearful nature, and
our natural man fears beyond al measure lest y^ when he is ones dead and laid
in his grave, he should never return and live again: yea he thyncketh that he
is past all hope and comfort.

Hell and dampnacion.
When these things come into his mind, man is straight ways afraid lest he
should utterly be cast away from y^ face of god, and sees none other thing
then everlasting death. Here ought he to be on a good ^onfort: here ought he to
take heart unto him, that by no means he be fai^ herted and so fall into
desperacion. O most merciful god, O most favorable father, A godly prayer
grant I beseech thee and help, that while we are yet in good health and
lusty, we may learn to fear thee, we may regard and love thy word, we may
set thee always before us to be that scope and prick, where unto we may direct
al our deeds / and that we always reme^bri^g this most bitter agony and grievous
co^flicte, may arm and make our selves strong against it, that we giving our
selves to godlynes and to the true fear of thee, may appointe all that ever
we do unto thy glory and enjoy everlasting life. AMEN

When thy sins do disquyet and trouble thy conscience, the^ call to
remembrance, ^^at the Son of God came down from heaven into this world, and
that he being made man laid upon him al thy sins and the sins of all the
world: and y^ for the^ he willyngly suffered death on the cross, and made
satisfaction for them all, yea and for our sakes sustained most grievous
pains, to bring us out of death. This most precious blood of Christ was shed
also for thy salvation. Of this death also art you partaker if you do believe y^
christ dyed as well for thee as for Peter and Paul. Neither ought you to
doubt, but y^ he dyed as well for thy sake, as for Paul's. For you art baptized
into ye death of christ. This ought to comfort the: this ought to lif^ up and
stablish thy mind. For seeing you art baptized (...) y^ death o^ christ, (...)
Romans vi.
the death of christ shall bring thee help and salvation, by y^ death of christ
y^ shall dye to sin, by y^ death of christ you shall receive perfect and full
remission of al thy sines: to conclude by ye death of Christ you shall rise
again into anew and everlasting life. For baptism is a bargain couenaun^e and
sign of gods grace and favor in which you art reconciled to god, y^ throw it
you may have a merry and quyett conscience for year missio^ of thy sins
through y^ resurrection of christ. ^he ^upper ^^ the lord.
Christ also speaks unto thee without doubt i^ the institucio^ of his supper,
where he professes and evidently declares, ^ath. xxvi.
that his blood was shed for the remissyo^ of sins. Now therefore, although
you have lived a life never so sinful and vnpure yet is there no cause y^ you
shul^est despere, but rather yt without any tar^au^ce you should without cesing
call upon the name of ye lord ye you may be saved, and pray after this manner.

O most merciful God, Romans ^ A pray^^
O father of all mercy the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, be merciful to me
a sinner, have pytie on me, and quickly help me poor wretch for the most
bitter, but yet the most precious passion and death of Jesus Christ thy only
begotten son, and our only redeme^ and savior. AMEN.

Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord. Handle me not according
to my deserts and Merits, neither reward me after mine iniquit^e, but for
thine infinite and unmeasurable bounty and exceeding great mercy, receive me. I
miserable and weak creature am in thy hand / I am thy boundseruaunt and thy
debtout. O most gentle god, O most favorable father, forsake me not* cast me
not away pore wretch yt. I am. I am thine with al yt ever I ca^ make. No man is
able to comfort me, no man is able to deliver me, no man is able to help me,
but thou alone. Thou art the true helper in adu^^sitie, thou art the most
sure and ^^esent comfort in all necessity, you alone art our help, our
bulworcke, our fortress and our most mighty and strongly defenced tower.
Thou, O God, art our refuge / thou art our strenght, you art our helpe^ in all
our ^ribulacions. In thee, O Lord / do I trust let me not be confounded. Let
me never be put to shame, let me not be disceaued of my hope, but preserve me
for thine own ryghtuousnes sake. Bow down thine ear unto me / make haste to
deliver me. Be my defender, O God, and my strong hold that thou may save
me. For you art my strength and my refuge, yea you art my God, and my destenyes
are in thy hands. Lyghte^ thy cou^te^^u^ce upon thy servant, save me for thy
mercyes sake, O Lord. etc.
