The prayer Of our Lord.
O Lord God our Father in heaven we thy miserable children upon earth,
beseech thee mercifully to look upon us, and lend us thy grace, that thy name
may be sanctyfyed among us and in all the world, through the pure preachinge
of thy wurde, and true knowledge and understanding of the same, and through
earnest charity in our dayelye conversation and lyuinge, seclude thou
graciously from us all false doctrine and evil living, whereby thy worthy name
might be blasphemed and slaundered. Oh let thy kyngedome come, and be great to
all sinful and blind people, and such as be holden captive of the deuell and
his kingdom, bring thou Lord us to true repentance and to the knowledge of
the true say the, in Jesus Christ thy son. Strengthen us Lord with thy
grace, to do thy will in all godly wurkes, and to suffer the same in life and
in death, in well and in woe, that our will may be always broken, offered up and
mortified. Give us our daily bread, preserve us from all covetousness and
immoderate carefulnes of the belly, that of thee we may be assured to have
abundau^ce of all good things necessary for us, forgive us our trespasses,
that we may have a glad and a quiet conscience in thee, in that we receive
forgiveness of our sins, as we be wyllinge to forgive all them that trespass
against us. And lead us not into temptacion. But strengthen us Lord with thy
spirit, to subdue the flesh to despise the world with the vanities thereof,
and to overcome the deuel with all his crafty assaults, and finally deliver us
from all euel, both bodily and ghostlye, temporal and eternal, for thine is
the kingdom, the power and the glory for ever. So be it.

O Almightye and everlasting God, Father, sone and holy Ghost. Thou that have
made heaven, earth and all things in them contained, have mercy upon me
poor wretched sinner, daily assaulted with all kind of misery and
wretchedness, I beseech thee o Father, for the love of thy son Jesus Christ,
consider my imperfection and have mercy upon me, encreace thy grace in me, my
savior, my redemer, my iustifier, for I come unto thee O Lord, according
unto thy wurde, for thou have said, come unto me all ye that labor, and are
lade^ and I will refreshe you, O my most merciful Lord and savior, ease me
of my burden of sin, which I have unrighteously committed in deed, wurde
and thought, and refresh my soul with thy mercy, O reconcyle me with Isope
and I shall be clean, and open my lips (O Lord) that my mouth may show thy
praise, consider my imperfection and have mercy upon me, and help it with
thy great mercies, remember thine old wonted mercyes, faithful promysses made
to our forefathers, Abraham. Isaac and Jacob, and al other thy saints in
our savior Jesus Christ, who being compassed with infirmities and weakness
of the flesh come unto thee (O LORD) the well of life and everlasting
fountain of their health and salvation, and thou mercifully sustained them
kepest them and defendest them in all their temptations and tribulations, if
their feet any time slipte or went out of the way, and committed sin
against thee, yet thy mercy was always ready, so that thou by thy holy spirit
had procured them again by repentance, so that they turned again unto the,
which conversion or turning again thou mercyfullye acceptest at their hands,
for because they were desirous to live perfectly in thy sight, thou
preseruedest them, so that they be found faithful before thee, O Lord thou
art the same, and thy years e^dure for ever. I beseech thee O father bear my
infirmities and imperfeccion, and help it likewise with thy mercy, if at any
time I happen to fall and commytie sin against thee, yet as thou saidest by
thine Apostle Paul, let thy grace at all times be sufficient for me, so that
I may immediately turn again betyme to repentance unto thee, which conversion
and turninge again, accept always at my hands for Jesus Christ's sake. So
shall I be found perfect before thee, for although ye spirit be willing, yet is
the flesh untoward and weak. Therefore do I not lay mine own righteousness
before thee, for I know and confess me, that is to say, in my flesh me,
that is to say, in my flesh is nothing but plain misery, wretchedness and
sin. Therefore do I come unto thee, and beseech thee for Christ's sake to er
tend thy merciful hand toward me, do away mine offenses, for I know (O
Lord) that all grace and goodness comes of thee, and therefore art thou
praised (O Lord) and feared in the congregation among thy sainets, for thou
only art he that gives victory. O Lord God of hosts, and that as thou
saydest by thy Prophet Zachary, neither through an host of men nor through
strength, but through thy spirit. Therefore I beseech thee give me not only
strength and knowledge of thee, but also a ready earnest purpose and will to
subdue mine affections, and grant me grace at all times too live as thou in
thy holy wurd have prescribed unto me moreover I beseech thee make me perfect
in thy sight, that I may re^dre continual thanks by Jesus Christ unto thee,
and where as I have not hitherto endeavored my self, according to ye power
which thou haste gene^ me to live after thy will, I pray thee of forgeuenes
for Christ's sake thine only son our Lord, and now I proteste before thee
through ye help of thy holy spirit, to order my life from henceforth
according to thy wurd, and to walk perfectly before thee. Nevertheless I
beseech thee for Christ's sake at al times to bear the imperfection that any
time is found in me and deliver me by thy power and mercy, encreace my faith
O my redemer, encreace my faith O my fauiour encreace my faith O my iustifier,
encreace faith hope, love, charity and all other virtues consonaunte, and
agreeable to a godly life, for I come unto thee (O Lord) the Well and
everlasting Fountain of all health and salvation. O my heavenly father, let me
and al other which seek thy wurde to thentent to forsake sin and to amend
their lives, live in thy sight, I thank thee (O Lord) with all my heart, soul
and mind, yt it has pleased thee of thy great mercy and goodness to creat and
form me of the molde of the earth, and give me members needful to my body,
and that it has pleased thee to preserve alwhich (thou have created in me)
sithe^s the time of thy creation until now, and that it has pleased thee to
deliver me from the hour of te^ptacion, and in my tribulacion, as well slepig as
wakig when I was forgetful of thee as when I remembered to call upon thee and yt
it has pleased thee to minister to my necessities, meat, drink and clothing
and as inward rejoicing, quietness of mind, health of body and such like, and
that it has pleased thee to give me this woman to be my wife as a remedy
co^solatie and comfort in all my necessities. Grant us grace (O Lord) truly
together to honor love and serve thee, for I know that whatsoever I do, either
good or evil, it shall be re warded of thee. Lighten us therefore daily, I beseech
thee with thy grace that we may govern our selves, our household and
children, which thou have given us in the true faith, fear and knowledge of
thee, so ye it may be an acceptable sacrifice unto thee, by Jesus Christ our
lord. And seeing it has plesed ye O father to lighten ye inward eyes of my mind
with thy grace, and to call me from the great blyndenes of ignorance and sin,
wherein al men are born, to ye knowledge of thee, let it now much more (as
saint Paul says) please thee to preserve me and all other whom thou have
called, which be daily oppressed by sin, and desire to turn and come unto
thee (of what tunge or nation whatsoever they be) thorough the whole world,
and seeing it has pleased thee to call me by grace to the knowledge of thy wurd,
and give me a will to seek it to love and believe in it, let it be thy will to
direct my ways that I err not, stay my feet with thy holy hand, and
preserve me with thine arm, for I am else far to weak, for without thee I can
do nothing. O let me live in thy sight O Lord, and put me not out from thy
presence, but give me a new heart and a new spirit, that I may always call
upon thee in time of my trouble, and offer thee an acceptable sacryfyce by
Jesus Christ before thee, even the fruit of those lyppes, which confess thy
name, give me grace (O lord) patiently to receive the Cup of health and
salvation at thy hand, and call upon thy name in the time of mine adversity, O
hear my prayer I beseech thee let my power and pleasure be always in the fruit
of the tree of life, which is in the Paradyse of God, O accept these volentary
sacrifices at my hands as the sweet smell of incence, and let the lifting up
of my hands be an euenig sacrifice, pleasant and acceptable unto thee thorough
Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom be everlasting praise honor and glory, now
and ever. Amen.
