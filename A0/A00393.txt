A Sermon of the child Jesus made by the most famous clerk Doctor Erasmus of
Roterda^.

To be pronounced and preached of a child unto children.

A sermon of the child Jesus made by Erasmus to be pronounced and preached of
a child unto children.
I A child going about to speak before children of the ineffable child
Jesus will not wyshe the eloquence of Tullie / which might stryke the cares
with short and vain pleasure / for how much Christ's wysdom is in dystaunce
from the wysdom of the world (the dystaunce is unmeasurable) so much ought the
christen eloquence dyfferre from the eloquence of the world. But this I would
ye might with (...) vows (...) with me of (...) so good a father of the good
(...) fyte praise / that likewise as our hole life ought to express none other
than the spirit Jesus Christ (of whom this day we do entende to speak) so
likewise this our sermon may sauer on him / represent him / breath him /
which is both the word of the father and has all only the words of life /
whose lively and workynge speech is more percyng then any.ii. edged swerd
percynge to the very inward chaumbers of the heart. And yt he / from whose
body flodes of lyuyshe water do run / will vouche salve by the instrument of
my voice as it were by the pype of a co^duyt to flow into the minds of all
you / with the plenteous moisture of the heavenly grace to water them. This
thing so I trust shall come to pass (most derely beloved felows) if we will
join to the godly requests / ears which be purged and true^^ thirsting. That
is to say such ears as that eternal word requyrynge in the gospel of
sayntte Matthew the. xi. Chapitre says. Qui habit aures ad audiendum audiat /
that is to say

Who has cares to the entente to hear / let him hear. But as touching me /
why may I not be bold to en terpryse this thing hard I will not deny / but
yet godly / namely god him self being my ayder and helper / in whom the
less man's infirmyte trusts in his own powers the more able it shall be / and
in whom Paul bosteth that he can do all things. Moreover sith these persons
do (...) with such fervent (...) and affection which have wedded and appointed
themselves to the warfare of this world / that is to say / of the devil that
each one of them should extolle / auaunce / and magnify their captain with
all the (...) of praise that can be ymagyned / how much better and sooner
ought we to magnify even auye who can do best with devout hymnys and
commindations our master / redemer / and captain Jesus / and the same also
the prince of all in general / but of us children in especial? Him first and
principaly to know let us study / known let us praise / praised let us love /
loved let us express expressed let us counterfeit / counterfettynge let us
enjoy / enioynge let us take immortal felicite. But in so plentyfull and so
unmeasurable copye of thyn ges from whens shall we take a beginning of our
sermon / or where shall we find an end? Sith he of whom we ente^de to
entreat is the very fou^tayne or (to speak more truly) the occean see of all
goodness and good things. But as he himself of nature incomprehensible and
infinyte / yet was contented to compass and drive his own self (as who
says) into a straight. So likewise our sermon in expoundynge his praises
which be of themselfes unmeasurable / must of necessyte put a measure to it
self. Ueryly I see that there be three things principally which be wont to
kyndle and inflame the hertes either of scolers or of souldyours to do
valiauntly and manly / the first is to be brought in to an admira / cyon of
their guide or captain! the secounde to love him / the third the reward.
wherefore to thentent we might with more fervent and cherefull courages obey our
master and captain Jesus / go we to. Let us consider severally al these three
things with a devout curiosite in him. First of all how wonderful he is on
every side and to be astoyned at. After that how greatly he is to be loved and
for that cause also to be followed. And last of all what high profit / fruit /
and advantage shall arryse unto us by this love. How / it is the usage of
Khetoricia^s in this kind of oration to show ensamples of noble princes / to
this purpose and intent that by the comparyson of him whom they praise with
other / his nobles and virtues might appear the greater. But our captain so
greatly and wonderfully surmounteth all the heyth of humane dignite / and
hyghnes that who^ soever a man shows be he never so worcester thy excellent and
high / yet he shall seem to add darkness and not light. For whose progenye and
noblenes shall not seem smoke if thou co^pareste him with Jesus which by an
unspeakable / nay with an vnthynkable reason is borne god of god always without
time egall in all things to his eternal and most high parent. How be it
though we go no further than to his humane nativity / I pray you do it not
easyly enshadowe and obscure the clearnes of al other kings and princes in the
world? as he which wonderfully above the course of nature / his father of
heaven being the worker and author / the holy ghost breathyng / the aungel
being the massanger / without man's industry was borne a virgyne / of a virgyne
being pregnant and with child by the handworke of the heavenly father / and
was borne a man / and in time. And again was so borne a man that another be
left to be god / nor yet he drew none of our fylthynes unto him at all. Now
sir what can be ymagyned more ample than he which being infounded through all
/ yet restreyned in no place abides in himself vncompassable and
vnmcasurable? what is more rich than he which is the very chyef and principal
goodness / from whom all good things do issue / and yet he is not thereby
dyminyshed? what is more renoumed than he which is the renoume of his fathers
glory / and which only lyghtneth every man coming into this world? what
is more mighty than he to whom the father almighty has given all power in
heaven and in earth? what is of more force than he which with a simple beck
made all / at whose commandment the sea falls / the shappes of things be
turned / the dyseases flee / the armed fall down / the deayls are driven away
/ the elements they / the rocks of stone are cut in sonder / the dead wax
a live again / the sinners be converted / finally all things be made new? who
is of wyder imperye then he / which they in heaven magnify / they in (...)
tremble at / this mydde world humbly worshyppeth / to the comparyson of whom
/ the most haut and high kings confess themselves to be but wretched worms?
what is stronger and more victorious than he which alone / death which was to
all other (...) ouercam with his own death / and which laid down and abated
the tyranny of Satan by his heavenly prowes and virtue?

What is more triumphaunt than he which breaking and spoylynge hell
accompaynyed with so many godly souls like a valiant conqueror ascended up
to heaven and there sytteth at the right side of his father? What is wyser than
he which with so wonderful reason created al things that even in the very
little bees he has left so many and so great miracles of his wysdom? and
which with so wonderful order of things and harmonye knytteth / conteyneth /
admynistreth all which goyth round about all and yet departs not from
himself mouyng all / being him self unmoved / shaking all / himself quiet /
finally yt which is most folyshe in him / passes by long dystaunce the hole
wysdom of the wise men of the world / whose authorite ought so much the more be
the greatter unto us / that the father himself openly witnesses of him saying
/ here is my well-beloved son in whom is my pleasaunce / harken to him. What
is so reverend as he to whose eyes all things be open? What is so to be drad
as he which with his only beck can send both soul and body into hell. What
is more beautyfull than he whose countenance to behold is the high joy?
Finally if many things be had precious for the antiquity? what is more
ancient than he which neither had beginning nor shall have endyng? But it were
perchance more convenient that chyldern should wonder at the child / for here
also he ap pereth wonderful in so much that the lowest of him is more high
than those things which be most high in men. How great was he whom being but
a babe cryeng wrapped in cloutes cast like an abiecte thing in the crybbe /
yet the angels from heaven magnify with their song / the shephardes worship /
yea she that bare him worshyppeth / the brute beasts acknowledge / the sterre
shows / the wise astronomers (...) / king Herod fears / all Jerusalem
tremble at / holy Symeon embraces / Anna prophesies the well disposed people
are brought into hope of salvation. Oh the low hyghnes and high lownes. If we
wonder at new things what like thing was ever outher done or herd / or
thought? If we marueyle at great things / what can be by all manner of means
more ample than our Jesus whom no creature can outher express with the voice
/ or conceive with thought / whole greatness who will compass with words / he
does much folysher than if he went about to draw up the wide occean see with a
(...) dysch / his immensytie is rather to be worshypped than expounded / at
which we ought so much the more to wonder that we can not atteyne it / and why
should we not so wrsyth that great purseuau^t Johan Baptist pronounces
himself unworthy to unloose the latchettes of his (...) Bope to / then sweet
children let us glory with an holy pride in this so noble a child Jesus our
master / in this so worthy a captayn / let his high nes encourage us to
enterprise devoutly / in him only let us please our selfs that thynkyng all
that is his to be com mon to us all / we may judge and count our selfs better
than (beyuge ones addicte to such a captain) to serve the world or vices / so
vile and fylthy masters

The secounde part.
BUt the deuyls do wonder and also tremble at him / only good men loves him /
wherefore the other part of this sermon as it goes more nyghe unto us / so it
is to be herd with more attentyfe cares that is to wit for how many causes
Jesus is to beloved of us / nay to be reloued rather / for he loved us not yet
created before all time in him felfe in whom even than were all things. And
therefore by his natyue goodness when we were naught / he formed us / and he
formed us / not any manner best / but man / and he formed to his own lykenes /
that is to wise / receyua ble of the high joy and with the holy breath of his
mouth he did put into us the breath of life. Beside this all other beasts and
fowls commanded to be obedyent at our commandment / more over the angels
appointed out to pro tecte and defend us / he assygned and gave all this most
wide and goodly buyldyng of the world to our uses and behoues / in which he
has set us in a certain wonderful stage to the (...) that in the things
created we might wonder upon the wysdom of the makee love the goodness / have in
reverence and veneration the power / and that we might the more do thus / be
has furnyshed us with so many helps of senses / and has garnyshed us with
so many good qualities of mind and has decked us with so bright and quycke
light of wit. what can be ymagyned outher / more wonderful / or happyer /
than this creature? But oh cursed envy always the compaygnion of wealth / again
by the subtyltie of the serpent he fell wretchedly into sin that is to wit
into worse tha^ naught. But here agayue thou oh good Jesu with what vnspecable
(...) /with what vnherd an example / with what incomparable charity haste thou
restored that work yt thou dydest creater for on such wise thou dydest
restore it yt i manner it auay led them that they fell / and this fault there
is one person which not without cause calls it an happy fautewe were / al yt
might be / bound to him that crea ted us / but to him that repared us we owe
more than all. wylfully thou keste thy self down from the kingdom of the
father into this our exile to the entente thou myghtest make us which were be
fore banyshed and driven out of paradyse the cytyzens of heaven / thou tokest
upon the our humanite to call us to the fellowship of thy diuinitye / thou
dydest put upon the this our flyme to the intent thou myghtest cladde us with
the glory of immortality / being covered in our shappe / thou would live
many years with us in this wretched world that thou might bring us yea thus in
to the love of the / naked thou crepst up into this light nay night rather /
with us nay for us thou (...) cry like a ba be / thou dydst hu^gre / thurst /
suffer heat cold / labor / werynes / neade / watchyng fasting / and to so
many euyls of ours thou woldeste be thrall / to the entente thou should bring
us exempted front all cuyls into the communion of the / that is to say of the
high joy. Furthermore through out all the hole process of thy most holy life with
how lively ensamples wist thou inflame our (...)? with how holsom precepts
doyst thou nourture and form us? with how won derfull miracles doyste thou
awaken us? with how fair monitions doyste thou draw us? with how sure
promises doyst thou muyte? so that there is none more commodious way to the
than by thy own self which only art the way / the troth / and life. But
thou have not only showed the way / but also thou hau^e opened it while thou
would for us be bound / drawn / damned / skorned / whypped / bespytted / be
beat / be reuyled and at last also upon the rode of the cross / like a lamb
without spotte be offcred / that by thy bonds thou myghtest loseu us / by thy
wounds heal us / with thy blood wesh us / with thy death bring us to
immortalite. Brefly thou bestowedst thyselfe holly upon us / that by the loss
of the (if it were possible) thou might save us which were lost / when thou
were restored again to life thou apearedst so often to thy disciples / and in
their sight dydest stye up to heaven that they might trust to com thythee where
they saw their head to have gone before them. This done to the intent thou
myghtest yet more conferme thy friends / thy father pacified / thou dydest
send that noble pledge of thy perpctuall love / the holy ghost / that dead to
the world we might live now in the far more truly and blessedly than we
lyueby this our own spirit. I beseech you / what can be added to these proves
of high charity. Nor these so many and so great could not satysfye thy most
brennyng love toward us. For who can rehearse with how many deaths of martyrs
thou doyst encourage us to despise this world? with how many ensamples of
virgyns doyst thou kyndle us to chastity? with how many monumentes of
saynctes doyst thou attyse us to deuoutnes of mind? with how wonderful
sacraments of thy church doyst thou fortify and enryche us? how doyst thou
comfort / left up / arm / teach / monyshe / draw / rauyshe / change /
transform us with thy mystical and divine wrytynges / in which thou would
certain lyuyshe sparks of the to be hid / which might styre us a great
enkyndyllyng of love / who so laboreth to drive them out with a de uout
dyligence. Finally how art thou every where in our way / to the intent we
might not forgette the / beside this how fatherly doyst thou suffer us when we
sin? How mercyfully doyst thou receive us when we return? Nor thou doyste
not impute thy good deeds for them that be kind / nor our evil deeds thou
doyst not lay against us / when we (...) / how ever among wist thou pluck
us and draw us with secret (...)? how doyste thou amend and chastyse us by
(...)? how entysest us by prosperities? how moueste thou every stone sekeste
every way to the wode? thy most ardent charity never nor no where (...) in
co^for tyng / reuengyng / defendyng and making us blessed? But what a few
things of so innumerable have I (...) gentyl compaygnyons) and yet ye se what
unmeasurable an hepe of (...) it is? Bo now / who (...) and let him magnyfie
Pylades / Orestes / Pyrithoos / Theseus / Damon / and Pythias with painted
words / which be all but tryfuls to these. And all these benefytes has he
given freely / of his own mere motton / to us / which have nothing deserved
them / nay when we were renaweys / traitors / and enemies / and which could
do him no pleasure again. If with mean kyndnesses men be kyndeled to love a
man / shall we not at least way reloue our creator / redemer so loving / so
kind? for he requires none other amends of us / which he also powers
again to our lucre. The adamante melts with gootes milk / cgyls / lions /
leopardes / dolphyns / dragons knowledge and requyte kyndnes / and oh the
hardncs of man's heart harder than the adamant / if (...) melts not by such
kyndnes which has not be herd of. O ingratitude / more unkind than wild
beasts / if it can forgette so great deservings.

O notorious vnsh amefastnes / nay mad nes rather / if so created so restored /
so enryched / oppressed with so great kyndnes / called to so great hopes can
love any thing save only him / in whom and from whom be all / and which
gives us part with him of all things. And although every mortal creature
takes these commodities / yet we especially be bound unto him / because that
by many probations he has declared himself to be of a syngular tenderness and
favor toward our order / I mean toward us children. First that (as he was
promised by the saynges of prophets) it pleased him to be borne a young child
where as in deed he was without all measure and quantity. Moreover that yet
closed in the deene of the virgynes womb he reioysed to be saluted with the
spryngynge and lepyng of an infau^t also not yet borne. Beside this that forth
with he would his (...) to be hallowed with the blood of (...) children / so
that with these light harnysed souldyers (as I might say) the most (...)
captain might begin his batell. To this may be added that / his tryumphale
death approchynge / he coming to Jerusalem would be gloriously received
with the procession / metynge and loving kyndnes of children rather then of men
/ and would have his praises to be song and proclaimed with the sweet voices of
children. Now sir / how loving and busye a defendour and (...) was he of
children which when the mothers offered their children unto him that they might
be blessed by touching of him / he being disconte^ted with his disciples that
they would not suffer the^ to come unto him / said. Let the babes come unto me.
Nor he did not only bliss them / but also he said that (...) might come to
heaven that would not humble himself according to ye young babes. Again how
louyngly did he also when he so sore frayeth men from offendynge his little ones
sayng / it were better for a man to have a millstone henge about his neck and
be cast into the sea / than that he should grieve one of these babes / and to
these words mark what a gooly addicyon he made in co^mendacyon of children?
Truly I say unto you their angels do always see the face of the father. O
good master Jesus thy little flock which is offered unto the / give thanks
unto the / whom I beseech that thou wylt vouchsaue always to lay thy holy
hands upon them / and defend them from all greuaunce. And is not this also a
great token of love when he did set a child in mids of his disciples to be
an example for them to follow / saying. Nisi conuersi fueritis and efficiamini
sicut paruulus iste, non intrabitis in regnu^ coelorum. Oneles ye be converted
and be made as this babe is / ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
Hitherto also belongs that when Nicodemus demanded of Christ by what way
he might come to everlasting bliss / he demanded him to be borne again /
that is to wit / to come again into a child. Lo so greatly infauncy pleases
Christ our captain / yt he enforces also the aged men to wax children again
/ if they will be received into his compaygnye beside whom there is no hope of
salvation. Nor S. Peter does not disagree from his master Christ / where as
he aduertiseth us as new borne children to covet milk. Nor holy Paul
dysaccordeth not / saying. Filioli mei quos iterum parturio donec formetur
Christus in vobis. O my little children / q Paul / whom I again do bear and
bring forth / like the woman lyenge in chyldbed / while Christ be formed in
you. The same Paul gives his little babes (for so he calls them) milk to
feed on / in Christ. There be right many such sort of places in the
mystical and holy scriptures. Generally and at one word to speak the thing
/ Christianity is none other thing in the world / but a certain new birth
which in the Bible is called a regeneration / and (...) is none other thing
(...) a being a child again. (...) is than the mystery of a child / great is
the mystery of chyldhode / wherein Jesus so greatly was delyted. Let not us
then (...) our age which that true (...) and estemer of things has made so
much of. Only this one thing / let us give our devour that we may be such
children as Jesus loves / surely he loves innocent and harmless children
ready / and apt to (...) / and simple. And let us also remember this thing /
that this chyldhode so greatly and so derely beloved of Christ lies not in
years / but in minds / it consysteth not in times but in manners. For there is
a certain kind and sort of children / which is clean ouert wart / and
greatly to be fled of us / which have smothe chynnes and roughe minds /
children and berdles in age / but old in vityous sleyght / soteltie / and
myscheyfe. wherefore there is also a certain new hynde of chyldehode which is
allowed of Christ a chyldhode without chyldysshenes / and generally to speak) a
certain aged chyldehode / which stands not in the noumbre of years but in
innocentie and simplycitye of wit / does not Peter openly show the same when
he says. Deponentes igitur omnem maliciam / and omnem dolum / and simulationes
/ and (...) / and detractiones / sicut modo geniti infantes / rationabile / and
sine dolo lac consupiscite / vt in eo crescatis in salutem. That is to say /
wherefore layng a part al malice / and (...) wyle / and hypocrisies / and
enuyes / and backebytynges / as new gotten infasites / reasonable / and
without gyle couct ye milk / that by it ye may increase into salvation. why
added he reasonable? truly because he would exclude fowlyshnes which
customably is wont commonly to be the compaygnyon of this age. why does he
contracte and take away enuyes / simulations / and the other vicyes / which
cspecyally raygne in old men? surely to the intent we should understand that
the children of Christ be esteemed by their simplicite and pureness / and not
by their birth. And in like wise S. Paul also says. Malicia paruuli estote,
sensibus au^t perfecti. In malice ( q he) be babes / but in wit be ye
perfect / how be it there is vntuersally in the very age of children a
certain natyue and natural goodness / and as it were a certain shadow and
image of innocencye or a hope rather and dyspositton of a goodness to come. A
soft mind and pliable to every behauour / shamefastnes which is a good kepar
of innocencit / a wit void of vices / bryghtnes of body / and as it were a
flower of a floryshyng world / and (I can not tell how) a certain thing alye
and familiare to spirits. For it is not for naught that as often as the angels
appear with thy show themselfes in chylderits lykenes / yea moreover they
that use art magic when so ever they fetch up spirits with their enchaunte
mtee^s (as men say) they be called up in sykenesse of a bodily child / but
how much more gladly will that heavenly spirit called upon with devout and ho
ly vows enter into such mansions? wherefore to these gifts of nature if
imitation of that high and absolute child be cast unto / then finally shall
children seem loving and kind toward him and also worthy and fytte for him /
for the (...) that so provoke / who can not but love? (...) such is the
vcrtue and (...) operation of true love / that thou (...) to be so like (as may
be possible) unto the thing which thou love / (...) thing if humayne love
works in us / what zele of following shall (...) love kyndlc / to which the
other compared / is uneath a little shadow of (...) if truly and with heart /
not with only words we love Jesus / let us cudeuer for our power to express
Jesus / or rather to be transformed into him. And if we can not follow the man
/ let us children follow the child / how be it this is no chyldes fete / yea
it passes the powers of aged ysons / but it is a thing which in manner never
chau^seth more happily than in children / for so often as the matter depend on
maas help / their strength / age / the distinction of male and female is (...)
and co^sydered / but where ye mat ter (...) / (...) nature / there (...) his
wonderful work / so much ye more that there is but little help and trust in
the flesh. Finally what doubt we or distruste / sith he himself forms /
fathoneth / and transformeth us / who^ we cudeuout to express? who added so
great prudence to the child (...) who to the child Salomo^ gave so great
wysdo^? who to tho. (...). children (...) so great pacte^cer who made child
Hely worthy to com to gods speath? who to child Nicholas / to Bylys / to
Beuet / to Agnes / to Lesyly / to so many so tender virgyns gave so manly and
invincible virtue? Truly not nature but grace / and where nature less helps
/ there more wo^detfully works grace / wherefore bearing ourselfes bold of
this grace / let us with a great heart and stomach enterrpryse ye study to
follow ye child Jesus / and let us never move our eyes from hymbeynge (as who
should say) our mark. we have a perfyte and an absolute exemplar / there is
nothing else where / to be soft. All his life continually cries what we ought
to do. For what teaches us that most pure child that he was borne of a most
pure virgyne? but to eschew all fylthe and defowlementes of this world / And
to meditate a certain angely call life even now in earth that is / to
meditate that here / which there we shall be contynyully. Truly the spirit of
Jesus generally abborteth and hates all fylthynes but specially that beastly
lust and utterly unworthy for man. what taught he us in that he was borne
fro^m home in another country / delivered of his mother in a vile cotage / cast
down in a cribbe / wrapped about with vile cloutes? but that we should always
remember that we be here strangers for a few days / and that all riches
trodden under fete and the false honors of the world despyfeth we should haste
us being as light and lose as may be to our heavenly country through vertuose
labors / in which our heavenly and natyue country we ought already to live in
mind although we touch as per the earth with our corporal fete. Again what
monyshed he us in that he fled into Egypt / but that by all means we should
eschew to entermedle with contagious people which labor to put out Christ in
us (that is to wit) innocencye / and the despysyng of the world? what taught
he us that he was (...) / but that we should cut of all carnal atrections
which disturb us haltyng unto Christ / and that being dead as (...) were in
our own selves be led and nouryshed only with the spirit of Jesus? what
taught he us in that he was (...) up in the temple / but that we should holly
offer up and dedicate our selves even from our infauncie to god and to holy
things / and forthwith the vessel of our mind being yet new and fresh
drink into us Jesus / for no age is^ (...) to learn holiness / nay rather none
other age is more tymely and mere to learn Christ / than that which knows
not yet the world. Now consider ye with our selves (oh children) with how
holy studyes and occupacyons that same child so borne so offered up to god did
pass our his chyldhode. Not with ydelnes / not with eating and drynkyng / not
with sleep / not with vain sportes and plays / not with fowlyshe fables / not
with straynges abroad / as the common sort of chyl dren are wont to do / but
outher with minystryng and seruyug his parents / or with holy prayers / or
hearing the preachers and teachers / or with devout meditations or with holy
and arnest communications with other children / has not saint Luke in his
gospel comprysed brefly all these and many other like / when he writes in
this manner. Puer crescebat and confortabatur plenus sapientia, and gratia dei
erat millo. That is to say. The child grew and wexed strong / full of wysdom
/ and the grace of god was in him. Do ye not manifestly see a new kind of
chyldehode. Of the children in times paste it was said. Stulticia colligata est
in cord pueri. That is to say. Folly is teyed to gether in a chyldes heart. Of
the new child ye here. Plenus sapientia full of wysdom / why do we any longer
excuse our rudenes under the clock of our tender age / when we hear a child
not one ly wise but full of wysdom? Se how this child has inuerted all
order of things which says in the Apocalypse Ecce ego noua facio omnia / that
is to say. (...) I make all new. The wysdom of the aged is destroyed / and
the prudence of the prudent is dysalowed / and children be replenyshed with
wysdom. And for this very cause he gives thanks to his father / saying.
Quoniam absondisti haec a sapientibus and renelasti (...) paruulis. because
thou haste hid these from wise / and have dysclosed them to infauntes. But
lest we should here couette and study for the fowly she and desceytfull
wysdom of this world he adds forthwith. Et gratia dei erat i^ illo The grace
of god was in him. He when all is done is the wise man and has the right
knowledge / which to the world is but a fool / and which sauereth nothing
but Christ. He is known not by the books of the philosophers / nor yet by
subtle and sophistycall arguments / but by pure faith he is known / by hope
he is holden / by charity he is won. How many things has this child
taught by his ensample? when he was but. xii. (...) of age he stale away
preuely from his parents / which could not be found neither among his
kynsfolke / nor among his acquayntaunce / at last was found after the space
of. iii. days. But wheare I beseech you was he found? In fayres / in
markettes / in ways / i tauerns daunsyng or synging? Harken ye children where
the child Jesus was found / leuyng his friends and in manner a fugityue and a
renaway / and ye shall casyly understand where ye ought to be consernaunt. In
the tem ple (I say) he was found sitting in the mids of the doctors
hearing their reasons / and demanding questions of them. What has Jesus
taught us by these so wonderful deades? No doubt but that he has taught us
some great thing / some earneste matter / and to be hyghly followed / and what
is that? Surely that while Christ ware bygge in us (for he is also borne in us
/ and has his degrees of ages / until he grow up to a strong and perfet man
/ and into the measure of his fulness) wherefore while (I say) he ware bygge in
us / he teaches us to transfer and shyft our natural affections which be
toward our parents and other friends upon god / nothing to love here /
nothing to magnify but in Christ and Christ in all / let us remember that we
have our true father / country / kynsfolke and friends in heaven. But left a man
would ymagyn with this neglectyng of parents should sauer any pride or
disobediencie / it follows. Et erat subditus illis. And he was subiet unto
them / nay rather none more truly loves his parents / none more naturally
honoreth them / none obeys them more obsequiosly / than he which thus
co^temueth them. What is it to sytte in the temple / but to rest in holy
things / and to bring a mind to learn / quiet from al worldly cares?
Nothing is more turbulent than vices / and again wysdom loves (...) and
quyetnes. Now / of what any person shall we disdain to learn / how attentyte
cares ought we to give to our masters / when that heavenly child Ie sus the
wysdom of god his father / sytteth in mids of the doctors / hearing and
again demaundyng of them and aunswerynge / but so aunswerynge that all
wondered on his wysdom? Nor no wonder sith he was such one / to whom all the
wysdom of the world is folyshe. The knowledge of laws is a goodly thing / the
sete^ce of philosophy is a noble thing / the profession of divinitte is a
thing hyghly to be magnified. But who hears Jesus / forthwith all thing
ware folyshe / but our answer though it can not styre a miracle of wysdom at
lest way let it sauer of sovernes and discretion / let it sauer innocence.
Again I beseech you how obeysaujit / how seruyable becomes it us to be to our
parents and masters (whom we ought to prefer as they which be the
parents of the wit) sith that lord of all / at what time he was of that
deep wysdom that his parents understood him not / yet he retur ned with them
to Nazareth submyttyng himself unto them. we owe this to the natural love /
we owe this to the reverence toward our parents / that otherwhyles we give
place to their will though we see better what is to be done than they. But now
it is good to see with how mete an end Luke has concluded the chyldehode of
Jesus.

Et Jesus ( q he) proficiebat sapientia, aetate, and gratia apud deum and apud
homines. Jesus ((...) sayncte Luke) did further in wysdom / age / and grace
with god and with men. How many things in how few words has he taught us?
First of all that with the grow and the encreace of age / the encreace also
of holiness ought to be copled / (...) that sayng be ryghtly spoken upon us
which sayncte Augustyn spoke upon the com mon sort of men. Qui mayor est
aetate, mayor est iniquitate. 1. the (...) in age / the greater in lewdnes. Or
lest in this most goodly and fayer baiell we should at any time rest us and
stand still / or think that we have won the fylde / but after the manner of
them / which run at a game neglectyng that which we have left behind us /
contend always and labor fourther up / and always assaye to clyme from good
to better / from better to the best / till as last it be come to the mark
(that is to say) to the end of this life.

Socrates what time he was very aged even as though he knew nothing / so
always he thursted to learn / and that of any one. So likewise we the more we
be in Christ / the less we shall please our selves if so be that we profyt in
him truly / so that always the standing in a maus own conceyt is the very
pestilence and veter destruction both of studies and also of goodness. And after
(...) /the over ripe kind of wit tes comes not lightly to thryste neither of
leruyng nor goodness / I think that the order also is not in vain apud deum,
and apud homines with god and with men. So that we ought to understand that
cheyfly and first of all we must apply us that our life may please god / and if
we do so / the favor of man shall follow alone. For nothing is more fayer than
virtue / nothing more amiable / after whom praise is accustomed the more to
follow / the less that it be coueted. With as few words as we might we have
expressed unto you (children) an exampler and president of a child / whom we
ought both to love most / and follow most effectually. And surely so much shall
we seem to love / as we shall follow him. Again how much the more (...) we
shall love him / so much the fuller we shall follow him. Wherefore let us
require this one thing of him with daily and pure prayers / that he will grant
us to brenne in his love / to prove like unto him / that is / chaste / pure /
un spotted / mylde / simple / easy to be entreated / void of craft / ignorant
of gyle / knowing not what envy means / obeysant to the parents /
obsequious to the comaundeme^t of our masters despysers of the world / auowed
to holy things / attent and wedded to godly letters / passing our selves
daily in goodness / allowed of god / well accepted among men / and by the savor
and smelle of our good name alluryng very many to Christ. These things (I say)
continually let us require / these let us attempt both with hands and fete /
while our age serve us which will else flee shortly away / for if Duintilian
monyssheth a right saying. Optima statim ac primo discenda. 1. The best
things are by and by and first to be learned / I pray you / what ought to be
learned sooner than Christ / which is best of all things / nay rather what
other thing ought a christian man to learn than him / whom to know is (...)
life as himself witnesses prayuge his father in the gospel / which thing if
we do / we shall as it were for our power yield thanks and acquyte his kyndnes
and singular goodness toward us / and in thus acquyryng him / we shall win him
unto us. And the more fully we shall acquyte / how much the more (...) we
shall reloue him. So much the more we shall reloue him how much the more we
express him in life and manners. And the more we express him / so much the
more we shall be enryched in him.

The third part.
But in the mean while some per chance will think that this is an hard
warfare to cast up all and take the cross with Christ / but let us remember
(most dear brethern) that the nature of the world and of Christ is far con
trarye and diverse. The world as it were a painted harlat at ye first sight
shows it self unto us amyable / and (as it were) golden. But after / the
deper ye enter in / and the more narre ye look in / so much the more and more
/ foul stynkyng and bitter be all together Contrary wise Christ / to the^ yt
behold him a far of / he seems so^ what hard while we see crosses and the
despysyng of pleasurs and of life. But who that with a trusty and bold heart
casts himself holly upon him / he shall find nothing softer / nothing more
at large / nothing sweter. Oneles perchance he himself being the very troth
speaks not the troth in the gospel where he says. Colligite iugum meum super
vos, and inuenietis requiem animabus vestris. iugum enim meum suaue est, and
onus meum leave. Take my yocke upon you (says Christ) and ye shall find rest
to your hertes / my yocke is sweet / and my burden is lyte. This undoubtedly is
the very hard way of virtue which in old time long before Christ's coming
Hesiodus in manner dremed on / at the first enteryng in and coming to / sumwhat
roughe and hard / but after one be a while entered / it is always more and
more easy and pleasant. But admit it to be a very sharp way of it self /
I pray you how can it seem sharp sith by it we go ye way to so cer tayne and
so great a reward. If according to the saying of the wise man. Spes premii
minuit vim flagelli. The hope of the reward does minyshe the violence of the
skorge / who in this transitory life would not judge it lyte and swett /
whereby he gets that heavenly life / and which shall never for sake him to
raygne eternally with Christ / to behold continually that high joy and goodness
/ to be conuersaunt in the company of angels to be far from all fear of
cuyls? who I pray you this so great a reward would not gladly bye yea with a
thousand deaths? and this so great a stypend does Jesus our captain promise
to his souldyers / which will not lie / nor can not deceive. Now ponder with
your selves the fruits / the eternite / and the magnitude and greatues thereof /
against which set the short time of this warfare which is no longer than ye
very (...) which life what is it else tha^ a vapor aperynge for a little time / or
a sleep of one hour. But we go to / of this mestunable reward let us a while
be still / and let us now see with how abundantly great rewards our guide
and captain recompenseth the labors of his souldyers also in this life / and
how an onlyke harvest they repe which be souldyers of the world / and they
which fight under Christ Jesu. Let us here what ye wicked men themselfes say in
the book of sapie^tie. Lassati sumus in via iniquitatis and perditio^is, ambul
auimus vias difficiles, viam autem domini ignorauimus. That is to say. we be
weary in the way of (...) /and of perdition / we have walked hard ways / but
the way of the lord we have not known. The world entyseth us with his cloked
and cou^terfet shadows of goods / which be nothing else but poisons covered
with honye / and by and by when we be ones plucked out of them and as it were
put out of service and forsaken / lord god / into what cares / what thoughts /
what troubles / what losses / what disworshypes / into what vexation of the
conscience of the mind / into what wretched end does it bring the unhappy
persons? So that they might seem to have suffered penance enough for their
wyckednes / though no hell should cusewe. But he which all the deceytes of the
world rejected / fireth his hole love / care / and study / upon Jesus / that
is / the high good thing / and hang holly on him / he according to the
promise of the gospcll shall not oncly possess eternal life / but also shall
receyuc in this world an hundredth times fold so muchc. And what is it to
receive an hundredth times so much? Ueryly for forged and counterfelled goods
/ true / for uncertain certayuc / for transitory crernal / for (...) pure /
for cares quyetnes / for vexation of mind trust and confidence / for
troublesomnes tranquillitte / for losses profit / for lewdnes goodness / for
the torment of conscience secret and incffable joy / for a foul and miserable
end a glorious and triumphant death.

Thou haste dcspysed riches for Christcs louc / iii him thou shall find true
tresures. Thou haste rejected false honors / so much in him thou shall be the
more honorable. Thou have neglec ted the affections of thy parents / so much
the more tenderly will the true father cheryshe the / which is in heue^s. Thou
haste set at naught the wysdom of the world / in Christ thou shall much more
truly be wise / and more happyly. Thou have despised pestiferous plea surs /
in him shall thou find facre other deynties. Brefly to speak when thou seyst
ones tho secret / and true riches of Christ / the mysty cloud of the world
driven in sonder / then all thyuges which here tofore seemed pleasant /
which (...) solicit the / thou shall not only not magnific and have them in
admi ratio^ / but a certain pestilent destructio^s and poisons thou shall (...)
/ (...) / cast of. For it chaunseth wonderfully that so sone as that heavenly
light touches thoroughly our minds / suddenly a certain new face of all
things spryngeth forth / so that it which a little to fore seemed dulcet /
now waxes tart / which sower / waxes sweet / which seemed vnfarynge waxethe
amyable / which seemed amyable waxes vnfarynge / which tofore gorgyous now
fylthy / which mighty / weak / which beautyfull defourme / which noble
unnoble / which rich nedy / which high low / which gaynes damage / which
wise folyshe / which life death / which to be desired to be fled / and
contrary wise. So that suddenly the face of things changed thou wolt judge it
to be nothing less than that which it seemed before / wherefore in Christ all
good things be found compendiously and truly of which the vain and counter
fet images and shadows / and as it were ioglynge castes / this world shows /
which the wretched common sort of peo ple pursues and seeks with so great
trouble of mind / with so great losses / with so great dangers / by right and
wrong. I beseech you what bliss can ye compare with this mind which is now
free from error / free from affections / without care / always ioynge for the
testimony of conscience / vexed with nothing / haut / high / and next to
heaven and now above the lot of man / which in Christ the most high pyllar and
rock / being borne and steyed by / all the falsities of this world / the
troubles / frayes / and storms depely laugheth at / disuyseth / or rather
reweth. For what should he fear which has god his protector? should he fear
reproach? Nay it is an high glory to suffer reproach for Christ. (...) nay
the burdayn of riches he gladly casts away who so hastcth him to Christ.
Death? nay / for that he most wysheth / whereby he is assured to be set over to
immortal life. For what thing should he take thought whose father in heaven has
not so much but his hears numbered and told? and what should he covet which in
Christ possesses al things? For what is not common to the members and to the
head? Now how great is man's not only felicity / but also dignity to be a
lyuyshe member of the most holy body the church to be al one with Christ / the
same flesh the same spirit / to have all one father with him / in heuens / to
have Christ our brother / to be destinate with him to the same enherytauncc.
And (shortly to conclude) to be no longer a man but a god? Put hereunto / a
certain taste of the felicity that is to com / which the good and virtuous
mind do perceive and enjoy ever among. This undoubtedly saw / this felt ye
prophet wha^ he says. Nec auris audiuit, nec oculus vidit, nec in (...)
ascendit, quae parasti. Deus diligentibus te. i. Neither care has held / nor
cpe has seue / nor it has not ascen ded into man's heart / which thou ((...)
god) haste prepared to them that love the. wherefore most derc companyons it we
will do our (...) that we may be be truly the members of Christ / according
to the saying of the prophet. Iustus vt palma storebit / the ryghtwyseman shall
flower like the palm tree / yea also in this life we shall spryng and flory she
with a certain perpetual youth / not only in mind but also in body. For
like as that flowryng spirit of Ie su shall redounde into our (...) / so
again ours shall slow into his body / and so much as may / it shall be
transfor med into it. Nor this so great beauty both of body and mind can not
bear the fylthyncs of garmente. For our mind is the habitation of god / the
body is the (...) of the mind / and the garment to as who should say in ma ner
the body of the body. So shall it com to pass that all the hole man shall be
correspondaunt to the purity and cleanes of the head until at last / this
life fynyshed we be led away to everlasting

The Epiloge.
GO ye to then / good fellows / to this so great felicity let us labor
with our hole might / let us only magnify / and have in admiration our
captain Jesus / then whom nothing is greater / nay rather without whom no thing
is at al great. Him only let us love / then who^ nothing can be better / nay
rather without who^ nothing at al is good. Him let us follow which only is the
true and perfyte exemplay of goodness / without who^ who so seems wise is a
foul. To him only let us cleave / him only let us embrace / in only him let
us take fruition / in who^ is the true peac / joy / tranquillity / pleasure /
life / immortality. what neadeth many words? he is the sum of al good
things. Beside him let us magnify nothing / love nothing / desire nothing him
only let us study to please. Let us remember that under his eyes / and
under the eyes of his angels which shall be our witnesses in time coming / we do
al thing what so ever we do. He is ialous nor ca^ suffer any fylthynes of this
world wherefore let us lyve i^ him a pure and angelycal life / let him be to us
in heart / in mouth / in all our life. Him through let us sauer / him let us
speak / him in manners let us express. In him let us set our busynes / our
quyetnes / toy / solate / hope / all our trust and confidence. Let him never
(...) from our minds when we be wake / and in our sleep let us contynually
dreme of him. Him let our (...) and study / yea and our play and bysportes
also sauer and smell of / by him and in him let us (...) / and ware till at
last we he grown up to a perfyte man / and our (...) valiantly brought to
end / we may keep a perpetual trumphe with him in heaven.

AMEN.
