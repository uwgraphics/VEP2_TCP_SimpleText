The end of the Table.
To the most honourale and virtuous Lady Anne, Douches of Somerset her ^race.
Thomas Becon her most humble and faithful servant, wysheth the favor of god,
increase of honor long life, and prosperous health* both of body and soul.
SO often as I behoulde the fact of this world* namelye of this realm of
England (mou Gracious Lady) I know not whether there be offered unto me greater
occacions of gladness or of sadness. For when I consider the horrible blyndnes
and monsterous ignorance, which heretofore reigned among us a great number of
years, yea and that almost universally in all parts of the Christen public
w^ale through the subtle devises of Sara and of his ministers, which to deceive
the folish blind world, fashyon them selfs like unto the Apostles of Christ
and walk as the Angels of light when notwyths^andynge they are in deed fal^e
Apostles and deceatfull worckers having an ^^warde apperaunce of godlynes, ii.
Cor. xi.
but utterly denying the virtue and power thereof: and now se the aforesaid
pestile^ces banyshed and driven out of this most flourishing real^ of England
through the wonderful working of Gods spirit in the Kings Mages^y, and in his
most honorable Council, I cannot but hartelye ^eioyse and ^y^e God most int^re
^ha^rkes. For who sees (...) e^cept he be wilfully blyn^e and obs^inatly
refuse to se^ how many ^o^able and excele^t benefi^s of ou^ salvation we have
re^^yued of God vnd^^ this our king a Prince for his godly dispo^icio^ (...)
^er^uous en^erprises worthy to enjoy not only immortal fame, but also the
years of a^ncient and long living M e^husel^h. (...) in these his young years,
by the advice of his most honorable Counsel, has no les travailed in putti^
^way Idolatry, Papi^^^y* Supers^icio^ and Hypocrysy out of this his graces
Realm, and in re^^oryng unto us his humble and obedient Subjects, the true
religion and the glorious Gospel of our savior Jesus Christ, then that most
godly young king Josias did in his kingdom of Judah, which being but a child of
eight ye^es ol^e when he began to reygne, did not wythstanding both studiously,
iiii. reg. xxii*
and earnestly seek after the God of David his ^ather* i. Pa. xxxi^^*
and turned neither to the right hand nor to the le^t. An^ in the.xii. year he
began to pu^ge Judah and Hie^usalem of hyl altars, groves, harued images, and
images of metal, so that they ^roke down the altares of Baaleuen in the Kings
presence, and the idols that were upon them, he caused to be destroyed. He slew
the Idolatrous Priests and the Chaplens of Baall. He destroyed the stews, and
whorysh houses, and put down the bugge^y places. He never cesed till he had
reformed all his whole realm, and brought in again the true religion of God.
O mos^ shyning myrrour and lively examplar for all godly Princes to behold and
follow. Even this also has our most Christen king done and brought to pass, in
his dominions, yea and that in a yo^ger age, for this his graces Relme is al
ready delivered from^ Antichrists tyranny. We are made free from his york. We
are combred no more with his trifling tradicions and dyrty deceyts. The
breakyng of his laws, disquiet our concience no more. His cerem^nies, are
banished. His religious mo^^^ures have no longer place among us. His inuocacion
of sain^ts his gaddyng on Pilgrimages his gilding of Images, his pai^ting of
tabernacles, his setting up of candles before stocks, his purgotory, his
Masses of Scalecely, his Bul^es his Pardons, his dispe^sacions* his Iubilies,
his iu^tificacio^ of works* his selling of merits, his canonising of Sain^s
his Diriges, his Tre^tals, his blasphemous masses, his Idolat^ous altares, his
(...) confession, his hussel in (...) kind for the lay, his holy bread, his
holy^ wate^, his oil, his cream, his wax, his fla^e, his Palms, his Ashes,
his Idolatrye, his Hipocrisy, his Candel styckes, his relykes, his Corporalle*
his Portasse, his shepehooke, his Maiseboke, his Crosure, his Mitoure, his
sensynge, his Popyshe ^astynge, his ^hauynge, his greasynge, his sacrifycynge,
his God making, his transubstanciacion, his excommunicacyon, his unchaste
chas^e vows, his hallowed bows, his Beads, his v^stimentes, his Idols, his
Romyshe seruise, his Antichristian orders, his Peterpens, his fra^^ense^^e, his
primary, and al his pel^yng pedla^y, is utterly banished and driven out of
this land. In stead of these outragyous pestylences of the Christen public
weal, is entered in among us the glorious light of Christ's Gospel, the true
knowledge of God, the right worshyppynge of God, the hearty calling on the
name of the Lord, the ^u^tificacion of faith, the hope of having remyssyon
of al our syns in Christ's blood, the godly and christen worckes, the sincere*
preaching of gods blessed word, the true ministracion of the holy Sacraments,
the reading of the sacred Scryptures in our own English ^oung, the knowledge
of our duty toward the Kings Majesty and all the hye powers, and how we
should behave our selves toward al men, yea and how we our selves ought to
live soberly, ryghtuouslye and godly in this present world, with an infinite
number of such godly treasures. And if any thing be behind that is not yet
brought unto perfeccion (as sores of long continuance are not strayghte ways
healed) I d^ubt not but that the Kings most exc^llent Magesty and his godly
prudent, wise, and ho^^rable counsel will se it reformed, and never leave of
^heyr godly purpose after the example of good king Josias till they have
stablished all things in this Realm a^cordyng to Gods word, and made this
church of England a worthy spectacle and no^able examplace for all forennacions
to behold and follow. The restorynge of the glorious light of Chri^tes gospel
unto us, the driuyng away of Papy^^ry out o^ this realm, the haui^^ of so
go^ly and noble a Prince to be our king and goue^nour assi^^e^ with so
honorable and godly w^^e counselors, are without al doubt the incomperable
and singu^ar great benefits of God, and evident tokens o^ his earnest good
will toward this realm of England, and the inhabytauntes of the same. He has
not dealt ^o with al nations neither has he showed so manifestly his blessed
will unto them. Psalm. clxviii
When I consider (most gracious Lady) these things, I am joyful glad and
merye, and Judge my self happy and blessed of Go^, that it has chanced me
^o live in that age wherein the whore of Babylon with all her marked
Merchants, is confounded: and the Lamb, I mean Christ, even in us his
we^ke members has gotten the vyctory where in also so godly a Prince, and so
virtuous a Council rules and governs this our country. But, as of these
fre^dly bene^yts of God I co^ceyue an unfeigned gladness in my heart, forasmuch
as through the^ I am fullye persuaded of Gods good will toward this realm of
England, so contrary wise am I many times provoked unto sadness, when I
consider our ingratitude* our unthankfulness* yea our beastly churlyshnes toward
god. For albeit many among us both of the nobylitye and of the base^ sort
(^hankes be to God) do both faythefully and earnestly embrace this loving
kyndnes of God, and be thankful to him for his benefits, ledinge for their
possible power a life worthy of his fatherly goodness, yet the most and
greatest part are unthankful, ii. Cor. iii^
and little esteem these syngulare benef^^s of God. yea there are (whose
judgments, wy^s, and senses the God of this world has blinded, because the
light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, which is the Image of God, shul^
not shine unto the^) that wyshe rather to be again in Egypt among the greasy
fleshepots, Number. xi.
deuour^nge Cucumbers* Melons, Leekes, Oynions and garlike, then to taste of
Mann^ that heavenly meat. Some o^ her again there be (would God not of
them, which be called Go^pellers and have the holy sc^iptures swimming in
their lyppes and Gods book either in their han^es or hangyng at their gyrdles)
which pretend a love to the gospelle and yet in their conue^sacion and living,
^rosse gos^ellers.
at a^ ungodly, vncharytable, vnme^cy^ull, unrighteous, proud, voluptuouse*
disdainefull, covetous, malicious, enuyous* idle. and cat. as the Papystes, yea
as the Jews* Titus. i.
Tu^ckes and Saracens arc. With their words they confess that they know GOD
but with their works they deny him. They are pleasant fygge trees and
blosomes but in truyte nothing at all. They are ^oute Disciples of Christ so
long as Christ fedeth them with bread yea they can be content to make Christ a
king, but when christ. requires of the^ a care and study for heavenly things,
Ihon. vi.
a constaunte Faith, a godly ly^e, a merciful heart toward the poor, then
are they gone. They are no longer Christ's friends then Christ serves their
turn In raylyng against papists, ^n defying the laws of the Bishop of Rome
in dispising the ceremonies of the chu^che* in eating of al kind meats
wit^out dy^ference of days in the presence, they care not of whom, in
absentyng the^ selves from the Common prayer and from the receyuynge of the
Lords supper, in breaking all honest and cyuyle orders in getting what may
^ee gotten under the pretense of the Gospel, in ^eadynge a dyssolu^e life, in
outewardelye speaking fair, ye inwardelye meaning craft and deceyt^. and
cet. in all these things (if such things may set forward the Gospel)
they are content to ^hewe the^ selfs fine Gospellers and sweet bro^hers, but
in mortyfying their carnal affectes* in dyeing to the world, in fie ghtynge
against Satan* and in cru^y^yinge the flesh, in dystrybutyng their goods to
the poor, in leadynge a life worthy of the gospel of Christ, they are worse
then the great Tur^ke* or any other infy^ell.

The Gospel of Christ begets and brings forth new life, and new
manners. yea, and those pure, hone^^ and godly. If such fruits follow not the
Gospellers profession* in vayn do they bragg^ of the Gospel, of the grace of
God, of the Christen lybertye, of the iustificacyon of faith, of the sacryfyce
of Christ's death, of the price of his pr^cyous blood, and of our ryghteous
making by his glorious resurreccyon. If they were the sons of God, they
would do the works of God. The son, says God, honors his father* and
the servant his Lord, If I be a father, where is my honor If I be a Lord,
where is my f^ate, says the Lord of hoastes? I^ we diligently martke the
manner^ of men, berelye the pride, Walach. i*
the couetousenes* the vnmercyfulnes, the envy, the malice* the voluptuous
liuyn^e, fayened frendshyp and such^ other abhomynable sins which reygne and
tryumphe now a days in us, shall euidentlye declare what good Gospelle^s and
perfect Christyans we are. It may shame us in this open light of the
Gospel, to bring forth the works of darcknesse, and to live as though we
knew no Gospel, no God, no Christ, no truth, God may well say of us, as he
said of the Jews, Esaias. i.
I have nouryshed and brought up children, and they have dy^pysed (...). GOD
calls us, and we refuse to go. Proverb, ^
GOD stretc^eth out his hand, and no man regards it, God commands us to
walcke in his vyneyard, and we loyter abroad ydlelye. Wath. xxi.
GOD gives us Talentes to occupye, and we buried them in the ground and do
no good with them. God calls us unto the Marriage of his Son, Wath. xxv.
and we have so much mind of our Fearmes: of our-O^en, and of our Wives,
that we have no pleasure to god. God would gather us to gether, Wath. xxii
as the hen doothe her Chyckens, but we will none of it. Luke. xiii.
God proffereth us the light of his glorious Gospel but we love to walcke in
da^ck^nes. God would show him self unto ^s, but we care not for the syghte
of him. Wath. xxiii.
God would us to be saved, but we regard not our salvation, O to much
vn^ha^keful chuc^yshnes. The Devil, the worl^e, and the flesh have so ^ly
ne^ed our eyes, that we ca^ not se what is good and profitable co^ts. What shall
I speak of the diso^e^yente and ^^ubbourne Pap^^ts, Papystes.
which both obstinately and malici^u^ly refute the manife^t truth of Gods
blessed word and will by no means consent unto it, although their own
conscience accuses and condempneth them for so ^oyng? Wat. xii.
If any commit that moos^e grievous sin against the holy Ghost, which shall
never be forgeuen, certes those Papists, which know the truth of Christ's
Gospel, and yet maliciously and or a set purpose wythall their power resy^^e
it, are gyltye of that sin. Mark. xiii. Luke. xii. Esaias. xxx.
These Papists, as the Prophet calls them, are an obstinate people,
vnfa^thfull children* yea childrene that will not hear the law of the Lord.
They cry continually, speak pleasant things unto us, and preach us false
things. Tread out of the way, go out of the pathe, turn the holy one of
Israel from us. Depart from us, O God, we desire not the knowledge of thy
ways. Job. xxi. Wath. viii.
These Papystes, are like the Gergesens, which for fear of losyng their
fylthy swyne, were loath that Christ should come among them. God turn their
hearts What shall I speak of the Anabaptists, Lybe^t^ines, Anabapti^es*
Libertines. Epycures.
Epicures, and such other sectaryes, which scorn and mock the misteryes of
Gods word, and live so licenciouslye and voluptuouslye without al fear of
God, as though there were no God at al* nor no life after this? God have mercy
upon us

When I consider this our both vntowardenes and unthankfulness, it makes me
sorowefull, because we aunsweare not kyndenesse for kyndnes but rather evil
for good. And to increase my sorrow, this sentence of our savior Christ
does many times come into my mind: The kyngedome of God shall be taken
away from you* Wath. xxi.
and shall be given to a people, that shall bring forth the fruftes of it. Our
life is so ungodly and we are so unfruitful in good works that with out al
doubt except we repent and amend, Gods word for our unthankfulness shall not
only betaken away from v^, but also for these most sweet and pleasant
benefytes of God, we may be sure to feel most bitter and grievous plages. God
will not be mocked. This is the condempnacion, says Christ, that light is
come into the world, Ihon. iii.
and men loved darcknes more then light, because their deeds we^e evil. He
loue^ cursing, says the Psalmographe and it shall come upon him: Psalm. cix.
he would none of the blessing, therefore shall it be far from him. The
propertye of God, which will not the death o^ a sinner, but rather that he
turn and live is first to send his Prophets and Preachers, to exhort the
people unto repentance and amendment of life. If they wyllyn^elye hear the
Preachers, repent and amend their life as the Ninevites did at the preaching
of Jonas, then are all the plages which their synn^s most iustlye had
deserved, turned away from them, Jonas. iii*
and the blessyng^ of God lyghteth upon that people. God favors them. God
keeps and defends them. God gives them abundance of all things. God
keeps their realms quiet and free from commocions. God sends them good
Magystrates and godly preachers. God prospers all their doings. But if they
despise the preaching of Gods word and will not redress their life
according to the rule and appointment thereof, but go forth in the lewdnes of
their heart and continue in all their abominations then does Gods curse fall
upon them, penury and scarsnes of al temporal things, insurreccions and
commocions, erroures and heresies. battle and pla^e cruel Tyrauntes and false
preachers, confusion of things and final destruction as God him self says by
the Prophet, Iere* xxix.
I will se^d upon them swearth, honger and pestylence, because they have not
heard my words, which I sent to them saye^h the Lord by my servants the
Prophets. Again he says, because they have forsaken my law, that I gave
them, and have not heard my voice* nor yet walcked thereafter, but followed the
wickedness o^ their own hearts, and run after strange gods as their
fathers taught them. Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of
Israel* behoulde. Iere. ix.
I will feed this pe ople with warm wode, and give them gal^ to drink. I
will scatter them among the Heathen, whom neither they nor their rathers have
known. And I will send a swearde among them to persecute them, and I will
never leave until I have brought them to no^ghte. The Prophet also says,
if ye will be loving and obediente, Esa. i.
ye shall enjoy the best things that grow upon the earth. But if ye will be
obstinate and rebellyous ye shall be devoured with the swearde. For thus the
Lord has promised with his own mouth. How doothe our sauyoure thonder
against Corasin, Bethsaida, and Caper. naum* and threate them everlasting
dampnacyon, because they would not receive the word of God, and amend their
living? Woe be to the Corasin woe be to the Bethsaida says Christ. Wat. xi.
For if the miracles which were showed in you, had been done in Tire and
Sidon* they had repented long agone in sackecloth and ashes. Nevertheless I
say unto you* it shall de easier for Tire and Sidon at the day of judgment,
then for you. And thou Capernaum which art lift up unto heaven: shalt be
brought down to hell. For if the miracles which have been done in the, had
been showed in Sodom they had remained unto this day. Nevertheless I say unto
you, it shall be easier for the land of Sodo^ at the day of judgment then for
you. Again he says to his Disciples and to all faithefull preachers, Luke. x.
he that hears you hears me* and he that dispyseth you, dispiseth me, and
he that dispisethme* dispiseth him that sent me. Therefore whosoever will not
receive you* nor hear your sermons, when ye depart out of that house or that
city: shake of the dust of your ^eete. Verily I say unto you, it shall be
easier for the land of Sodom and Gomor in the day of judgment, then for
that city. The dispisinge of Gods word and the preachers thereof, never
escapes vnplaged, as it is eu^dente by the historyes of the holy scripture.
Nohe preaceed to the old world and exhorted them to repent and to amend their
life, or elsse God would surely plage them. ii. Petr. ^^*
They laughed Nohe (whom S. Peter calls the right Preacher of ryghteousnes)
to scorn, and his doctrine. What followed* was not all the world drowned, eight
persons only e^cepted?

Lot seeing the unnatural and most abominable uncleanness of the stynkynge
Sodomites, Gene. vii.
councelled them to cease so to much licenciouslye to offend their Lord God.
They would not hear Lot nor his Sermons, but churlyshe^y entreated him. What
followed? Gene. xi^. ii. Peter. ^^.
Were they not consumed with water, fire and brymstone from heaven? O most
dreadful plages. The Jews many times fell away from their Lord God, and
worshypped strange Gods, and defiled them selves with all the abhominacions of
the Heathen. The Lord God of their fathers hauyn^^ compassion on his people,
sent to the^ by his messengers* yea betymes sent he to the^ ^^ore to warn the^
of the plages that should fall upon the^ if they did not repent and with all
their herts turn aga^ne unto the Lord their God. ii. pa. xxxvi.
But they mock ^che messengers of God, and de^pysed their words, and mis used
his Prophets until the wrath of the Lord so arose against his people, that
it was past remedy. What followed: Did not God send in their ennem^es among
them which slew their you* men with the sweard in their holy temple and
neither spared young man nor mayde^ neither old man neither so much as him that
s^euped for age? Were not al their goods spoiled, and their strong cities and
^owe^s destroyed, and bre^t with fire? Were not their kings bound in fette^s,
and had their eyes cruelly thurstou^, and so miserably carried away like bond
^laues and prisoners into captivity? If any men of war, or any connyng
Artificers remained alive, were they not all carried away, and compelled to
much wretchedly to serve in a straung^ country, yea and that their very
enemies? Horrible and dreadeful plages woul^^ these appear to the eyes of our
mind, and make us stand in awe of Gods vengaunce, if we had any fear of God
in us. i. Cor. x.
All these things says S. P^ule happe^ned unto them for examples, and were
written to put us in remembrance, whom the ends of the world are come
upon. Wherefore let him that thinks he stands take heed least he fall For
there is no respect o^ persons with God, but in all people he that fears him
and worc^eth righteousness is accepted with him. Acts. x
So likewise he that fears (...) God nor works ryghteousenes, but lives
with out al fear of God in wyckednes and ungodliness, may be sure to be
plaged, o^ what soever country nation, for kynred he be. For there is no
respect of persons with God.

Moreover after certain years of their captivity, God remembryng his promise,
even of his own goodness delivered them out of thraldome-and brought them
home again into their own conuery, Zere xxix
where by the space of certain years after their return even so long as the
Plagues were who^e, and fresh in their memory as the manner of the world is
they continued in the fear of God and walked according to his word. But when
they once grew unto a quietness, and by that means began to ware welthy,
they strayghtwayes forgott both God and his plages, and became the old men
again* Ambicious, Proud, Covetous, Malycious, Dysdaynefull, Or merciful,
Voluptuous and styrred up sedicion among them selves. They stryued who should
be hyghe^t in authorytye. They bought and sold all offices and dy^nityes. Not
the worthynes of the person, but the sum of the money was considered. They
gave their minds wholly to worldly honor and riches. He that could set
him self in the tygheste place among the officers of the common wealth,
howesoeuer he came by it, was co^nted the most worthy and most honorable
person. God and his word were set at naught. The Prophets and Preachers of
Gods word were brought unto extreme beggary made of no reputacion, and not
herkened unto. In this deep silence of Gods truth, there arose certain
sects (as the devil never sle^peth but watches his tym^) the Pha^iseis, the
Saduceis, the Esses, which in steed of Gods word brought in their own
tradicions, and so corrupted the holy law of God. God seeing this their
ingratitude and unthankfulness vexed them besides other pl^ges with continual
wars, and brought them under the dominion of the Romans, so that where ^s
before they were free, now are they in most miserable subieccion to
strangers, yea and those their enemies. For God will not leave the con^empte
of his word and wicked living unpunished. Notwithstanding God according to
his old and accustomed gentleness once again having petye on them, and
willing to prove, if yet now at the last they will repent and amend* that they
may be saved, sends not unto them his servants the Prophets as before but
his own dearelye beloved and only begotten son, to call them, by his most
godly sermons unto repentance and amendmente of life, and to wo^rke miracles
among the^m not only for the confirmacyon of his doctrine, but also for
their comfort. Christ preaches. Christ^ works miracles. Christ sends
his Dis^iple^ and Apostles abroad to preach, Christ turns every stone as
they say, to win the Jews unto true godliness, to bring them unto
repen^aunce, unto faith, and unto amendment of life. But how is Christ and
his doctrine received? Few godly persons excepted, the residue mock and
scorn Christ. They call him a tea^her of new learning* ^ne possessed with a
Devil a dece^^e^ of the people, a mad man, a glotten, a w^ne by^ber, a
frende-of synne^s and whores a Samaritan, and all that ^ought is. To be short,
they never put ^f their f^ry until they br^ught Christ unto death, e^e^ unto
the death of the cross. Math. xxvii.
This reward had good Christ of the churlyshe Jews for his vnres^full
pains taking. Notwythstan^ynge Christ shows him self ^^yll a loving
Sauio^^e even to his very enemies. Wat. xxviii. War. xvi. Luke. xxiiii. Acts
v.vii. Ac^es. ^ii.
For after his glorious resurreccion he sent forth his Apostles to preach and
to work miracles among them, to prove if they ^oulde yet convert and
a^ende. But what became of them, Some they priso^ed, some they whipped, some
they stoned* some they slew with sword all even so many as they cou^de get
they most cruel^ye ^n^^eated* so nothing were they moved unto repentance
either by the doctrine or miracles of the Apostles. After they had slain
Christ, God gave them.xl. years respyte to repent, always sendynge them
preachers ^o exhort them unto repentance and to a fore warn them of the
plages to come except they repent and amend. They would not hear but tyrant
like handled the faithful preachers of Christ yea the godly ^post^e Saint
James, which in there chief city Jerusalem was Bishop and Preacher among
them thyr^ye years after Christ's ascencyon* never c^^ssy^^e neither day nor
night to exhor^e them unto ^rue godliness, and to pray unto God to be
merciful unto them, and to forgive th^^ their sins* they moo^^e cruelly
entreat^d and unjustly put him to death. What followed? God which will not
always wyncke at the wyckednes of man, styrred up the Romans against
them, which besieged them so long* that the Jews were compelled for very^
h^nger (O horrible act and dredeful deed) to ^ate their own children, yea and
to creep into the pri^eies (O most lothesome thing) and to s^ratte out the
most fyl^^ye and stync^ynge doun^e^ (which eyes abhor to se and nose to
smell) and for very famyne to ^are it. Whose heart tremble^h not to hear
these things? One slew a another for mea^e. One plucked another meat ou^e of
his mouth. Some died for honger.

Some slew them selves. The houses were full of dead womenne and children.
The w^yes lay full of dead carcasses of old people. The young folk went up
and down in the city famished for honger, and as the very shadows of death
ready at every step to fall down, In the city was nothing but
lamentacion, sygh^nge, ceyinge, Weeping sorrow, Plage, Pestilence, Murder,
Famine, fear, tearing of hear, wryngynge of hands, cursinge the time of
their birth, desperacyon calling for death, lookynge for present
de^truccyon, and what so ever (...) unpleasant and deadely. The death in the
City through the plages and famine was so great, that besides, houses ^^etes and
great diches full of innumerab^e dead carcasses, there were cast out of the gates
of the city, six hundred thousand dead bodies of men, women and children,
O most lamenta^le ch^u^ce. They that were slain, were a leaue^ hundred.M. They
that were led prysonners away of the ennemies were in number fowrescore and
xvii. thousand. They that died for hunger in prison were.x^i. thousand. The
famous temple, the princelye palaces, the high towers, the strong Castles,
the gorgyous building, the pleasant houses, the thycke walls, the mighty
Fortresses, and all that ever there was, they threw down and burnt. All
things lost their old beautye. A dystructyon and very desolacyon of al
things was made: what so ever was within the city it went to havoc. psalm.
cxxvii.
There were two thousand of them that fled out of the ci^y^, which had their
belies ^ypte and opened in one night, to see if they had swalowed many goulde
into their bodies or not. There was nothing s^e ^^o^ the ennemy. O truly it is
said of the Psalmographe* excep^e the Lord keeps the city, he watches in
^aine that keeps it. If the Lord fyghteth, who can resist his power? If the
Lord will destroy, who can sa^e? If the Lord will cast down* w^n is able to
help up. proverb. xx^
There is no wisdom, no for^^a^^e, no Council that ca n^^ prevail agayn^^e
the Lord, All the towers, Castles. Fortresses, bulwa^ckes and ^locke houses,
all armoures, Gunnes, and a^tilla^^e* all st^engthe, valeaunce and pollicye,
can prevail no thing if the Lord be against us, which is almightye, as he
says by the Prophet, there is none that can take away any thing out of my
hand, and what I will do, can no man put away nor change. From that
distruccyon of Jerusalem unto this day, Esaias. xiiii.
the Jews have euerlyued like most vile^a^gaboundes and abominable abiectes,
having no certain country, no common weal, no kingdom, no priesthode. Verily
no man, e^cepte he be flynte hearted* can read the historye of the destruccyon
of Jerusalem, as Josephus do the dyscribe it, without most large tears.
Would God it were translated into our English tongue, that all men might read
it and learn to fear God. For it God spared not the natural olyue tree for
their unfaithfulness and disobedyence, Romans xi.
I in ca^e the Jews* neither will he spare the wild olive tree, I mean us
that are gentiles, if we commit the like offenses. If god would not spare them,
to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory, and couenauntes, and the law
that was given, and the service of God, and the promyses, whose also are the
fathers* and they of whom (as concerning the flesh) Chris^e came, which is
God over al things blessed for ever, is it too be thought that he will spare
us which were heathen in time past, without Christ, reputed a^iauntes from the
common wealth of Israel and strangers from the testaments of the promise* Ephe.
ii.
and had no hope, and were without God in this world, if we be found unfaithful
and dysobedyent? ii. Pete. ii.
If God spa^ed not the angels that sinned but cast them down into hell, and
delivered them into chains of darcknes, to be kept unto the judgment, let us
not think that he will spare us mortal and miserable wretches if we without
rep^tance go forth to offend his divine majesty. hebru. x.
He that despises Moses law, dies without merci, under two or three
witnesses, of how much more grievous punyshemente suppose ye shall he be
counted worthy, which treads under foot the son of God, and counts the
blood of the Testamente as an ungodly thing, wherewith he was sanctified,
and ^oth dishonor to the spirit of grace? Oh, it is a fearful thing to ^all
into the hands o^ the living God. Psalm. ^^*
For upon the ungodly will he rain snares, fire, brymstone, and tempest, this
reward shall the wicked have to drink. God have mercy on us and give us al
grace to ^eare him a right, to repent and amend ^ure life, to embrace his
blessed gospel and to ^ryng forth the fruits thereof.

What shall I speak of the mighty Monarchies or Empyres of the Assyryans and
Greeks, The Assiri^ and Greke^
which flourished not only with all kind of temporal ry^ches, but also with
most excellent and learned wits? Live they not now in most miserable
captivity under that cruel tiraunt the great Turk that mortal enemy of
Christ's religion? How came it to pass? Verelye they were disobediente to
Gods word, unthankful one to another, and led a life more lascivious and
wa^ton than that effeminate king Sardanapalus. God stirred up preachers to
exhort them unto repentance. They laughed them to scorn. It came to pas,
that God for their engratytude and churlyshnes gave them into such an ennemies
hand, as none could be found more hateful neither concerning Christ nor
Christ's religion, which at that time both killed and soulde an infynyte
number, and even at this present oppresses them with most miserable
servitude, and houldeth them down in most vile slavery, unto the great decay
of the christen faith, and unto the unspeakable sorrow of al godly people.

How came it to pass that the Rhodes even in our time is subdued also of that
most cruel Tyraunte the Emperor of Turckye, The (...).
turned from Christ unto Mahomet, from the christen religion unto the Turkish
profession? Was not superstycyon, I^olotry, feigned holiness colored chastitye,
that is to say, fylthy whoredom, stinking fornication, dyssoluteliuing, usury,
and such like abhom^nable vices causes hereof? God hold his holy hand over us.
To spe^e much of Germany, sometime a dear mother ^ loving Nurse, and
frendelye Patroness, of all learning, and a sure Sanctuarye for godly
learnned men to ^lee unto from Antichrists tirannye, Germ^nye.
a country sometime rychely endued with all spiritual ble^synges of god from
whom also braue^ out the comfortable light of Chri^^es Gospel, that now
shines here among us in this rea^me, very sorrow will not (...) me. O now
(...): a thing is it so noble fre and famous a cont^ye to be brought into
^lauery, yea and that wor^e is godly and Christian preache^s to ^e banishe^, and
wicked papi^tes to enter in, the preaching of Christ's Gospel ^oo be driven
out o^ the churches, and the popy^he service ^o be used the supper of the Lord
to be taken a way, and that most Idolatrous, ^^ynckyng and abominable masking
Mass to be received as a God. What christen heart l^menteth not too consider
the^se things. Of the plage that is now fallen among them* the men of God. I
mean the prea^hers told them full o^r to fore and exhorted them unto
repentance. But all in vain. For re^ay^e godly Magis^rates and learened men
excepted with a few other, the greater part of Germanye even as in the Popes
kyngedome walcked still in the words of darkness. They talked much of
Chri^^es Gospel, but lived no part thereof. They abused the spyrytual^
lyber^ye of the Gospel, and turned it to Carnal ^^edome, making the
Gospel, a clooke of their wickedness. These abho^ynacyons ^oulde no^ God
su^fer, seeing that before all other nacyons he had ^euen them the knoweledge
of his holy word. Notwithstanding I doubt not but that God for his mercyes
sake, and for the love of his elect whom that country nourysheth, Psalm.
lxxxx.
will shortly turn away his anger from them* and lyghten his chereful and
loving countenance agai^e upon them* as he says by the Psalmographe. If they
break my ordynaunces, and keep not my commandments I will ^iser their
o^fences ^i^h the rod, and their sins with scourges. Nevertheless my louinge
kindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my truth to f^il. The Lord
is full of compassion and me^cye* long su^^erynge and of great e goodness* ^e
will not ^e^le with is after our sins, Psalm. ciii.
nor ^ewarde ^s a^cor^yng to our wyckednes. For look how hye the heaven is
in compary^on o^ the earth so great is his me^cye also to wa^^e them that
fear him. Look how wy^e the (...) is from the went, so far wy^ he set ou^
sy^nes from us. yea, like as father p^^teth his own children even ^o is the
Lord mercyful to them that fear him. For he knows whereof we be made* he
remembers that we are but ^ust* that a man in his time is out as grass* and
florysheth as a ^^oure o^ the feyl^e: For as soon as the wind goes over it*
it is gonne, and the place thereof knows it no more. But the merciful goodness
of the Lord endures ^or ever and ever upon them that fea^e him and his
righteousness upon their children, such as keep his couenaunte, and think
upon the commaun^ements to do them.

Moreover, as I may let pass diverse other hystoryes, whyc^e be leafte he^e
among us as monumentes of Gods vengaunce against the churlish and
vnthanckeful, and as they say come nere home. Read we not that god stirred up
Gildas to prech unto the old Britannes and too exhort them unto repentance
and amendment o^ life, Bryttayne.
and before wa^ne them of the plages to come* if they repent not? Wha^ (...)
it? Gildas was laughed to scorn and taken for a false Prophet, and a
malycyous Preacher. The Bretannes with lustye courages, whorishe faces, and
vnrepentaunte hea^tes went forth to sin, and to offend the Lord their God.
What followed? God sent in their enemies upon them on every side, and
dystroyed them and gave the land unto other nations. And sent that ryme God
has ^laged this real^e full often for their sin and dys^bedyence. Not many
years past, God saying Idolatry, supe^st^cion, Hipocrisye, and wicked l^uynge
used in this realm, raised up that godly lea^ened manne Ihon Wyclyfe to
preach unto our fathers rep^ntaunce, and too exh^rte them to amend their
lives, to forsake their Papistrye and Idolat^ye, Wicleffe with his books
condemned and brent for an heretic after his death
their Hyprocrisye supersticion, and to walk in the fear of God. His
e^hortacions were not regarded. He with his sermons was ^espysed. His books
and he him self al^o after his death were bre^te. What followed? They slew
their right king, and set up.iii. wrong Kings arowe, under whom all the
noble blood was slain up, and half the commones thereto, what in F^aunce
and what with their own ^werd ^n fighting among them selves for the crown,
and the cytyes and tow^es decayed, and the Land^ brought hal^e to a wilderness
in respect o^ that it was before. O extreme plages of gods vengau^ce. Sense
that time even of late years God once again having pytye on this realm o^
England, raised up his Prophets namelye Wyllyam Tindal, Thomas Bilney, Ihon
Fry^he, Doctoure Barnes Jerome, Garret, Anthonye ^arsone, with diverse other,
which both with their wryghtynges and sermons earnestlye labored to call us
unto repen^au^ce that by this means the fears wrath of God might be turned
away from us? But how were they entreated? How were their paineful labors
regarded? They them selves were condemned and bre^t as heretics, and their
books condemned and bre^t ^s heretical. O most unworthy act. The time shall
come says Christ, that who so ever kylleth you, will think that he doothe
God hye good service. Whether any thing sense that time has chanced unto
this realm worthy the name of a plage, let the godly wise Judge. Ihon. xvi.
If God has dyfferred his punyshement^, or forgeuen us these our wicked
deeds, as I trust, he has, let us not therefore be proud and hye myneded,
but most humblye thancke him for his tender mercies and beware of the like
ungodly enterprises heareafter. But how so ever the matter goes, of this am
I sure, that God yet once again is come on visytacyon to this church of
England yea and that more lovingly and beneficially then ever he did before. ^or
in this his visitacion he has redressed many abuse^ and clense^ this his
church of much ungodliness and superstycyon, and made it a glorious church, if
it be compa^ed unto the old form an^ state. He has given us a most worthy
Prince t^ be our king, iii. re.^^^^.
which haste not o^ both ^y^es folowinge God and Baal* Chr^^e and the Pope,
neither toucneth he unto the ryghthande nor unto the le^t, Deuteronomy Esaias. xx^.
but he wa^^eth ve^ye faythefullye in the ^ame way, that the Lord his God
has appoynnted: having always a respect unto gods law, that he may do
all things according to the ^ame. He has given the King his Mage^^y also
most wise and godly learened councellers to (...) his grace, Iosu. ^.
which unto the vttermooste of their power ^tudye to set forth the glory of
God, to maynetayne the true, and Christen religion: and to keep the common
wealth in a decente and quiet or^er. He has given us his most blessed
word to read. yea and that in our own English tongue. He^ has sent us
faythefull^ and godly preachers t^ instruct us aboundauntlye in the knowledge
of his blessed will. He has driven away that Idolatrous Mass, and restored
unto us the right use of the Lords supper. He has banyshed the Romysh^
service and supersticious Ceremonies out of the temples, and placed in their
stead godly Preachers and learned sermons. Certes louynglye and very
mercifully has god dealt with us in this his visitacion. And al these his
gifts are euidente tokens of his louinge kindness toward us. We have now
God our loving father and merciful Savior, let us take heed, that we make
him not of a friend a^ enemy. He has now blessed us with all manner of
spiritual blessyng, let us take heed, that his blessing be not turned into
curssing. He has now turned away our captivity, let us take heed, that he
throw us not again into our old thr^ldome, He has enryched us now with
many singule^ and noble benefits, let us take heed, that they be^ not taken
away from us for our unkindness and plages cast upon us ^n their stead?
If we walk worthy o^ gods kyndnes and of the^se his inestimable benefits,
eue^y man living ^n his vocacion with all humbleness of mind and meekness,
we be diligen^e to keep the unity of the sp^^yte in the bond of peace, ^^he.
iiii.
i^ we be ^nth^^c^eful to God for his benefite^ and benefi^^a^ to our p^ore
Christen brethren and sis^e^ne* God will surely increase these his ^^ftes in us
and en^^che us with mo singular ben^^ytes. He will surely prese^ue the kings
Ma^es^ye and his most honorable Counsel and give ^^em long and prosperous
life in this world unto the great conforte of all ^s his Graces subject ^. We
will defend this ^ealme* keep us harmeles from al our ennemy^^ and send ^s
a^oun^an^e of al things necessary for this present life* and after our
departure from this ^a^e of miserye* eternal glory. Contrariwise, if we will not
walcke wor^hye of gods kindness, but be ^nthanckfull for his benefytes, and
live now in this glorious light of the Gospel as beastelyke in pride* envy,
^ouetousnes. Malice, Voluptuousnes, Unmercifulnes and in all kind of other
sins, as we did before ^ndoubtedlye God will take away his benefytes from us
and power his plages upon us. He will bring in agay^ the pope, the popes
laws, the popes mass, the Popes Ceremonies* the popes lims, the Monckes, the
Friars, e^c Chanones, the Nu^s the A^kers, Anc^esses, the He^emi^es, and ^l the
table of hipocrites and the devil and all. And will take away our most christian
king and his most ^ertuous and honorable co^nsel and in their st^^e se^^e up
some wicked king and ungodly tyrauntes. He will take away our godly
Magi^^rates and give us C^terpyl^ers of the common wealth. He will take away al
godly learned preachers and send in Antichrists chapl^s. He will take away the
p^re flower of his heavenly wo^rde, and feed us with the^ sower leaue^ of the
Pharise^s. He will Plage us with Pestylence, ^^my^e and hunger. ^ea he will
sty^re vp^e one tyrraunte or other too take vengeance on (...), ^o shed our

merciful Lord and en^oye his benefytes unto the end: Verelye even that
thing which all godly men have ever used to do boothe in prosperity and

faythefull heart. For prayer if it be ryghtly used, is of great^ ^alure before
God^ and does not only make him our good and mer^ifull Lord* but also

nothing is more necessary too be used of thee treue Christians for the
contynu^unce of gods favor and of his heavenly blessings toward them,
and for the avoiding of all plages and dyspleasures, than prayer, for as much

and prosperous state of a common wealth, as every manne diligently, fayeth

knowinge how I may be able to do good to my country out by prayinge,
preaching and wryghtynge (for fortune gooeth forth frowardelye too trowne
upon me) have these few weeks pa^^e compiled and made a bo^e (...) Prayers,
comprehendynge not only necessa^y and conuenyen^ Prayers for all degrees or
men even from the highest to the lowest but also for all other things
necessary to be prayed for. So that if we will fol^we the order of charytye,
and do the will of God, which commands us to pray one for another, ^gayne if
we will pray to obtain virtue and to fl^ vice* this book shall mini^^er to the
godly, conuenyen^e and mere prayers. And because the prayers should be the
more acceptable unto god* and sound the better in his godly ears, again that
the godly exercisers of prayer may pray with the more fruit, and be the
better editted: I have trauayled to the vttermooste of my power too use in
these prayers as few words of my ow^ea^ I could, and to gle^e out of the
frutieful fyelde of the sacred scryptures, what so ever I found meet for
every prayer that I made, that when it is prayed, not manne but the holy Ghost
may seem to speak.

After I had finyshed these prayers most virtuous Lady, your (...) came
first too my remembrance, as a wor^^ye Patrones boothe of the godly and of
godliness, boothe of the learned and of learning, to whom even of most
bounden duty I ought to offer this my labor. The gift I confess is small
and slender, if it be^ compared with your graces lyberalytye, which your
grace has most bounteouslye showed unto me sense I came first too your
service. Notwythstandynge I am so fullye persuaded of your g^aces most
gentle nature and godly dysposyon toward so many (...) are godly and well bent
and vertuouslye minded, that I fear nothing to o^^er this my ^ooke unto your
grace, as a testimonye of my seruise^^le heart and ready bent good will toward
your grace. It is a flower, I grant. Notwithstanding such a flower, as if
it be rightly used, is of synguler virtue and mighty in operatyon. No
euyla^er can hu^te where the ^^uoue^ of this flower comes. yea the devil the
world and the flesh ca^ not abide the air of thy^ flower, so might is the
spiritual operacion thereof. The flower ge^^th a smell in the stre^es to the
soul of the faythefull, as Cimamone and Balm* that has so good ^ sauoure*
yea a sweet odoure does it give as it were mirre of the best. I therefore most
humblye besech^ your grace to take this my small gift in good part which
coming as it were from your Grace into the hands of many, shall (I doubt not)
do many good, and be the occasion that vice shall decrese, and virtue
abundauntly increase among us. God, whose holy word your Grace most fervently
love and most earnestly practice in your daily conversation might vouchsafe
to ^reserue your Grace with my Lords Grace, your most loving husband and al
your godly and ^e^tuous children in continual health and daily e^crease of
honor unto the glory of his name, and ^he comfort of al us your graces moost^
humble and faytheful ser^^^nts.

Amen.
The Prayer Of our Lord.
O LORD God our father in heaven, we thy miserable children upon earth,
beseech thee mercyfully to look upon us, and send us thy grace, that thy name
may ^e sanctified among us, and in all the world through the pure
preaching of thy word* and true knoweledge and understanding of thee same,
and thoroughe earneste charytye in our dayelye conuersacyon and living.
Seclude thou gracyously from us all false doctrine and evil living, whereby
thy worthy name might be blasphemed and slau^dered. Oh let thy kyngedome come
and be great to all sinful and blind people, and such as be houlden captyue
of the devil and his kingdom, bring thou Lord to repentance and to the
knowledge of the true faith in Jesus Christ thy son. Strengthen us Lord with
thy grace, to do thy will in life and death, in well and in woo, that our will
may be always broken offered up, and mortified. Give us our daily bread
preserve us from all covetousness* and immoderate carefulnes of the belly, that
of the we may be assured to have abundance of all good things necessary for
us. Forgive us our trespasses* that we may have a glad and a quiet^
conscience in the, in that we receive forgeuenes of our sins, as we be
wyllyng to forgive all them that trespass against us. And lead us not into
te^ptacion, but strength then us Lord with thy spirit, to subdue ye flesh to
despise ye world with the vanities thereof, and to overcome the deuell with
all his crafty assaults, And finally deliver us from al evil, both bodily and
ghostlye temporal and eternal, for thine is the kingdom the power and the
glory for ever. So be it.

O Heavenly Father, Psalm. xxxi. Psalm. xxvii Psalm. xii.
which like a dyligent watchma^ attendest always upon thy faithful people,
wheither they wake or ^lepe, and mightily defendest them not only from Satan
that old enemy of mankind, but also from all other their adversaries, so that
through thy godly power, they be harmless preserved, I most heartily thancke
the, that it has pleased thy fatherly goodness, so toe take care of me,
thine unprofitable servant, this night p^ste, that thou have both safelye
kept me from all mine enemies, and also given me swet sleep unto ye great
comfort of my body. I most entireli beseech the, o most merciful father, to
show ye like kindness toward me this day in preserving my body and soul, that
as my enemies may have no power over me, so I likewise may neither think,
breath, or speak or do any thing that may be dipleasaunt to thy fatherly
goodness, dangerous to my self, or hurtful to my neighbor, but yt all my
enterprises may be agreeable to thy most blessed will, which is always good and
godly, doing that, Leuiti, xix, Mat. xxii, Roma. xiii Galla. v, Luke ii.
that may auaunce thy glory, answer to my vocacion, and profyt my neighbor,
who^ I ought to love as my self: that whenever thou call me from ye vale
of misery, I may be found the child not of darkness but of light, and so for
ever reign with the in glory, which art the true and everlasting light, Iho.

A prayer for the night.
O Lord God and my heavenly father, forasmuch as by thy dyuyne ordinance the
night approaches, and darcknesse begins to ouerwhelme the earth, and time
requires that we give our selves to bodily rest and quietness, I render unto
the most hearty thanks for thy louinge kindenes, which have vouchedsafe to
preserve me this day, from the danger of mine enemies, to give me my health, to
feed me, and so to se^d me al things necessary for the comfort of this my pore
and neady life, I most humbly beseech the for Christ's sake, yt thou will
mercifully forgive me, all that I have this day committed against thy fatherli
goodness, either in word, deed, or thought, and that thou will vouchsafe to
shadow me this night under the comfortable wings of thy almighty power, and
defend me from Satan, and from al his crafty assautes, that neither he, nor
any of his ministers have power over either my body, or my soul, but that
although my body through thy benefit enjoys sweet and pleasant sleep, yet
my soul may continually watch unto the, think of the, delight in the, and
evermore praise the, that when the joyful light of the day returns according
to thy godly appoinctment, I may rise again with a faithful soul, and
undefiled body, and so afterward behave my self all the time of my life
according to thy blessed will and comaundemente, Romans xiii.
by casting away the works of darcknes, and putting on the armours of light,
Math. v.
that men seeing my good works, may thereby be provoked to gloryfie the my
heavenly father, which with thy only begotten son Jesus Christ our alone
savior, and the holy ghost that most sweet comfortoure, live, and reignest
one true and everlasting God, world without end. Amen.

The confession of our sins unto God the Father.
I Am not able to expres (oh wretched sinner yt I am) how grievously the burden
of my sins oppress me, whyther soever I turn me, whatsoever I do speak or
think, I perceive such corruption and wickedness, such abhominacion and
uncleanness to reign in me, Genesis vi. Psalm* l^v. John, iii.* Genesi, i^i, Eccl,
vii.x, Gene, viii, Prouer, x. Iere. xvii. Tobi, ix, Esaias. lxiiii Genesi. iii,
Roma. v. Ephesi, ii* Collos. iii,
that it utterly confou^deth my conscience, and in a manner fettereth me with
the cheyne of desperacio^. No marvel. For my outward manne is flesh, earth,
ashes, duste, donge, and all that most vile is. My thought and disposicion is
altogether naught eue^ from my very cradels, my heart is unclean, defiled with
most filthy sin, leude, and unable to be searched, for ye manifold wickedness
thereof, but of God alone. My works are abominable and loathsome in the sight of
ye most highest, yea my very ryghtousnesses, if any I have, are even as a
defiled cloth. Again my inward man has lost his former beautye. In stead of
the Image of god he is miserabli deformed with the wicked visare of wily Satan.
In the place of innocencye, faith, love, hope* patience, mercy, obedience
goodness, gentilnesse, liberality, joy, and such other fruits of the holy ghost:
wickedness, unfaithfulness* hatred, desperacion, vengeance, covetousness,
rebellion, maliciousnes, churlishnes, unmercifulness, pensiuenes of mind and
such other dampnable works of the flesh are e^tred into me, and holy posses
me, so that whether I consider my outward or inward man, I find my self ye
bo^d slave of Satan, Roma. vi. Deu. xxvii. Mat. xviii Gala, iii* Ephesi* ii*
Luke xv* Luke, x* Esaye* ix*
the vile do^ghil of si^ne, the miserable debtour of the law, the fire brond of
hell, the child of wrath, the vessel of vengaunce the son of perdicion, ye
wandering sheep, the wounded man an hipocrite, an unprofitable servant,
enheritour of everlasting pain and all that ever naught is. To ryd my self of
al these most detestable enormities, I am not able. To seek remedy at any

other works oh, it is but vain. Luke x.
Moses can not heal my diseases, neither the Leuite, nor the priest can bind

Al have sinned, all have gone astray, al owe to that heavenly king ten
thousand talentes. Al are become abominable, there is not one that does good,
no not one. Ah who then can be made clean of the^ yt are unclean? Ah, who
being sick, Job. xiiii. Ecc, xxxiiii

weak, will wish to be stayed up by him, which for feablenes is not able too
stand? Can the man of Inde change his skin? Ierem. xiii.

health of thy creatures, although sinful, so often as they repent, believe, and
study to amend their life, has set forth in ^hi hol^ scriptures another
doctrine, even the doctrine of the gospel, that most sweet, pleasant, and
joyful tidings of our salvation, which comforts, chereth, and makes merye
weak consciences, and sorrowful herts andanother righteousness eue^ the
righteousness of thy well-beloved son Jesus Christ, Rom* v. i, Cori, i. Math.

for whose sake art thou well pleased with man, and for whose innocency and
righteousness, thou frelye of thy bountiful goodness forgeuest the sins of so
many as with herty repentance flee unto thy mercy. I therefore (O most
merciful father) staying, and co^fortyng my weak conscience with the sweet
promises that I find in the holy gospel of thy derely beued son, made unto
all that be faithfully penitent without respect of persons, in the precious
blood of thine aforesaid son Jesus Christ, am bold (notwithstanding the
multitude of my sins at this present) to come unto the throne of thy mercy,
most humbly besechyng the not to weighe my deserts, Psalm, (...)
nor to deal with me according to my merits (for if thou should narowly
mark our iniquities, oh Lord, who shall abide it?) which deserve nothing but
wrath and da^nacion, but for the innocency and righteousness of thy only
begotten son Jesus Christ, Esaias. i^.^^ Romans vi.
whom thou haste given me to be mine own, and with him all his merits and
good deeds, to be through faith so truly mine, as though I my self had done

thy fatherli love toward me, to receive me into thy favor, to make me a
vessel of mercy, to number me in the company of thy chosen people, and to
endue me with thy blessed spirit, which may mortify mi carnal affects, s^ea old
Adam in me, work new and those spiritual and heavenly mocions in my heart, and

sacrifice for all my sins. For his sake, for his innocence, and righteousenes
have mercy on me (O God) according to thy great mercy, and put a way al my
vnrightuousenesses for thy tender compassion. I have gone a stray like a sheep
that was lost, Luke, xv,
yet O lord for thy mercies sake, seek me up, lay me upon thy shoulders, and
bring me home again to thy sheep foulde. I have been a lost son. I have
ryotously spent away my goods with ye wicked, yet for thy goodness sake (O
father) receive me, and take me home again, if not as thy son yet as one of
thy servants. I am grievously wounded, and can be holp neither by priest nor
Leuite, ^uke. ^.
yet cast me not away good lord for thy tender merces sak^, but pour wine and
oil into my wounds. bind them up, and never leave me till thou haste made me
perfectly whole. So shall I after this be ye more circu^spect in trayninge my

most blessed name through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with the and the holy

A confession of our sins unto the Lord Jesus Christ.
THe tirra^nye of satan mine old enemy, ^. Peter. v,
which cease not daily to assail me with his subtle temtacions, and to
wou^d me with his cruel darts compels me at this present (O blessed redemer
and mine alone savior Jesus Christ, the son of the true and living god) to f^e
for succoure unto the pitiful bowels of thy tender mercy, lest I be for ever
swalowed up as a pray of that dreadful Dragon. John, xii, ^iiiii.^v ii. Cor.
iiii Ephesi, vi.
O Lord I am feeble and weak, but Satan is strong and mighty, the Prince of
darkness and God of this world, having at his commaundme^t an infinite multitude
both of wicked spirits, and of ungodly me^, which both daily and diligently,
travail to sat^sfy his cruel tira^ny, and to work my destruccio^, whom to
resist I am not hable. Luke, x^.
Notwithstanding lord, thou art more valeaunt then he, stronger then all his
army, more able to save the^ he to condemn. Io^. i.ii.
Yea he is thy bond slave. Thou rulest him as thy good pleasure is* He can rage
against thine elect no further* the^ thy most godly will is to suffer him. Thou
therefore (o lord my God) art able to deliver me from his rauenynge teethe, and
to keep me safe from his blood thyrsty ministers. Genesis iii.
For thou art ye blessed sede of the wo^a^, that tredeth down the head, (...),
xiii.
destroieth ye power of that old serpent. Thou art that Lord, i, Cor, xv.
Hebre, ii,
which has swalowed up hell. Thou art the king of glory, which by thy death
destroiest him that had the power of death, that is ye devil. Thou art that
Michael, Apoc^, xii*
which have fought with the Dragon and overcome him. Apoc, v,
Yea thou art that Lion of ye trybe of Judah, which haste vanquished al our
enemies.

Moreover not only Satan and his angels, but also ye world and the flesh
most grievously assail me, yea and lead me away captive as their pray. The
world with his vain pleasures, deceitful riches, and transitory possessions, so
blinds the iyes of my heart, that I ca^ not love the (o most sweet savior)
with such pureness of mind as I ought. John. x^^.
Notwythstandynge this comfort me* well that thou haste overcome the world,
and that when soever it pleases the to endue me with thy holy spyryte, I may
through thy grace subdue the world, and make it a bond slave unto me, Roma. vii.
which now so mightily reigns, rules and triumphs over me. The flesh also
with her subtle entisementes so wholelye occupies me, y^ I am all together
flesh, and all that naught is, and by this means wholely without thy holy
spyryte. Esaye. vii. Matthew. i. Luke. iiii, John. i.
Yet haste thou by the pureness of thy blessed flesh which thou haste
unfeignedly taken of the undefiled maid Mary thy mother by the wounderfull
operacion of the holy ghooste, so slain the raging lusts of our sinful
flesh, that whensoever we lament our cause unto the, confessi^g our miserye
and weakness, Romans i.i^. Gala. iii^. i. Timo. ii. Hebre i^. i. Ioh. iiii. Apoc.
v.
thou both art able and also wylt through thy holy spirit quench those
ragynge lusts, mortifye those carnal affectes that so inordynatelye boil in
our inward members, and make us truly spiritual. Thus see thou (O most
mercyful redemer) with how great a multitude of enemeies I am beseiged and
sete rownd about, which without ceassing seek my destruccyon, and have all
ready most tirantelye, spoiled me of al my garments, and most greuouslye
wounded me, leaving me half dead, Luke. x.
so that without thy help I must needs perish. Help therefore (O most sweet
savior) and deliver me from these mine ennemies. Heal thou me O Lord and I
shall be heled. Save thou me, and I shall be saved, Iere. xvii.
Ah good Jesus, my sins are great and infinite. I confess, but thy mercys ar much
greater and more infinite. Mi wounds are many and grievous, Psalm. ii.
but thou art that most loving Samaritan full of pytye and compassyon, which
by pourynge wine and oil into my wounds are suffycyentelye able to heal them,
Luke. x.
although they were ten. M. mo. I am asinner but thou art a savior. Math. i.
I am sick but thou art a Phisycyon. I am blind, Math. i^.
but thou art the light of the world. I am Satan's prisonner, but thou art a
redemer. Ioh i.viii
I am dead in sin, but thou art the resurreccion and life. Gala. iii.
I am hongry but thou art the living bread. Ihon. xi.
I am thyrstye, but thou art the well of life. I am poor, John vi. Io^n. vii.
Esa^. ^v. Romans x. Psa. xxiiii John. xv. John. x.
but thou art the lord of al wealth. I am a barren tree, but thou art that
true and frutfull vine. I am the looste sheep, but you art that good sheperd I
am that ryotous son, but thou art that ^entle father. Luke. xv. Eyhe. ^i.
Math. xvi i. Pet. ii. i. Timo ii. i. John. ii. Roma. vi. Roma. vii. Ose xiii.
and.xiii. i. Pet. ^i.
I am by nature the child of wrath, but thou art by nature the son of the
living God. I am by nature sinful man, but thou art by nature man rightuous
and innocent. I am a daili offe^der, but you art a continual mediator. I am a
breker of ye law, but thou art a fulfiller of the same. I have lost the
heavenly enheritau^ce through sin, but thou haste recovered it by ^hi death, I
have wrought mine own dis^ruccion, but thou by thy precious blood haste wrought
unto me salvation. Thus all be it (O most merciful savior) I find in my self
nothing but sin* death and damnacion, yet in the find I grace, merci, favor,
reconciliacio^ forgiveness of sins and everlasting life. Take away therefore yt
is mine, which is al naught, and give me that is thine, which is all good Thou
art called Christ, annoynte me therefore with thy holy spyryte. Thou art
called a Physician, Luke. ii.
according therefore to thy name heal me. Mat. ix.
Thou art called the son of the living God, Math. xvi
according therefore to thy power deliver me from the devil, the world and the
flesh. Thou art called the resurreccion, John. xi.
lift me up therefore from the damnable state, wherein I most miserablye lie.
Thou art called the life, quicken me up therefore out of this death, John. xv.
wherewyth through sin I am most greuouslye detayned. Thou art called the
day, led me therefore from the vanites of this world* and from the filthye
pleasures of the flesh unto heaue^lye and spiritual things. Thou art called
the truth, suffer me not therefore to walcke in the way of error, John. i.
but to tread the pathe of truth in all my doings. Thou art called the light*
put away therefore from me the works of darkness, ^phe. v.
that I may walk as the child of light in all goodness, ryghteousnes, and truth.
Thou art called a Savior, save me therefore from my sins according to thy
name. Thou art Called Alpha, Math. i.
and Omega, yt is, both the beginning and end of al goodness, ^poc. xxii.
begin thou therefore a good life in me, and finish the same unto the glory of
thy blessed name, So shall I receyuyng these benfits at thy merciful hand
praise the, and magnify thy blessed name For evermore. Amen,

A Confession of our sins unto the holy ghooste.
O Most blessed And holy spirit, Equal God with God the Father, John. xiiii
xv, ^ xvi. i. John. v
and God the Son, I miserable sinner co^fou^ded in my conscience, and almost
fallen through the multitude of my sins, into the hellike pit of desperacyon,
am come at this preasente before thy deuyne majesty, most humbly to confess,
and from the boto^e of my heart to lamente all those my sins, and
wickednesses which from my youth hitherto I have unjustly committed, in word,
dead, or thought against thy goodness: most entirely besechynge the
mercyefullye to forgive me all those mine offenses, Psalm. ii.
and abhominacions, and to make in me a clean heart, endued with a new and
right spirit, which may from hencefourth through thy godly governance so
derecte me in all my doings, that I may only attempt such enterprises, as be
agreeable to thy blessed will, profitable to my neighbor, ii. Cor. iii.
and pleasant to my soul, O lord my God where thou art, there is lybertye. But
I through the crafts of Satan the lusts of the flesh, and the plesures of the
world, am in most miserable captivity, slavery, bondage and thraldom, whereby I
evidently perceive that thou dwell not in me, neither ye I am thy temple,
nor yet have that ghostlye fredome wherwyth all be endued that have the
dwelling in them. O Lord have mercy on me, and take away from me that heavy
bondage of the flesh, wherewith I am most gre uously enclo^ed, and give me yt
sweet and free liberty of the spirit, which bithe is wrought in the hearts of
the faithful, that I being delivered from ye power of mine enemies may serve
ye in holiness and righteousness all the dais of my life: Luke. i.
again that thou maki^g me a new creature by mortifying old Adam in me, and by
geui^g me a good spirit, mayeste delyght in me as a father in his son, and
continually dwell in me as in thy holy temple. O blessed spirit forgive me my
sins, puryfye my mind with thy holy inspiracion, comfort my weak heart with
thy ioiful presence, make merry my troubled co^cience with true and spiritual
mirth, led me, John. xvi.
which have so long erred into all godly truth, give me the knowledge of al
heavenly and spiritual things, eue^ so much as is necessary for my salvation,
put on me the shield of faith, Ephe. vi.
that I may be able to quench the fyrye darts of the devil, kyndle my heart
with the fire of Christian love, make me a frutful olive tree in the congregation
of the my Lord God give me patience in trybulation, Psalm. iii.
take away from me vain glory in prosperytie, engraf in my heart continual
humility, make be bold to confess the truth of thy Gospel before the
tyrauntes of this world, and give me grace to persevere in ye same, unto the
end. Replenysh my breast with thy heavenly gyfts and spiritual treasures that
the devil, the world, and the flesh, with al their worckes, pompes and
vanities from me vtterli secluded and put a part, thou may continuallye
dwell in me by thy godly inspiracio ns. and I in the through true and
undoubted faith, doing that always, yt is good and pleasant in thy sight unto the
glory of thy blessed name, which live and reignest with god the father and
God the son in one Majesty, power and glory, very god worlds without end.
Amen.

A prayer for bishops and ministers of gods word
O Lord Jesus Christ that true Psalm. ci.
and everlasting Bishop the Myrrour and lively exemplare Hebr. v.vii
of all faithful pastors and herdme^ both in life and doctrine, Esay^. lxi.
which came down from God thy father not only to be our redeamer, Luke.

but also our teacher, John. iii.
to open and declare unto us the mysteryes of the holy scryptures before hid,
Mat. xxii.
and corrupt through the leaven and false docrine of the Scribes, Math. xvi.
Mat. viii. Luke. xii.
Pharyseis, Saduces, and such other deceivers of the people.

We most humbly beseech y^, mercyfullye to behold thy poor and scattered
flock, whom thou have purchased with thy most precious blud* (...). xx.
and to send them such shepherdes as may diligently seek up the lost sheep,
Luke. xv.
louinglye lay the^ on their shulders, and faithfully bring them home again
unto the shepefolde. Ah Lord, thou see how great the harvest is, Math. ix.
Luke. x.
and how few ye workme^ be. Thou art lord of y^ heruest, vouchsafe therefore we
most humbly prai the to se^d laborers into thy harvest. Iere. xxiii. Eze.

Take a way these idle lubbers, which do nothing but devour thishepe, cloth
the^ selfs with the finest of the wol and eat of the fattest of the flock Thieves
and robbers are they, John. x.
and not pastores and preachers. For the weak they hold not up, the sick they
heal not, Ez^. xxxiii.
the broken they bind not to gether, the out c asts they bring not again,
the lost they seek not, but churlishly, and cruellye do they rule thy flock. A
good shepehearde gives his life for the sheep, but the hyrelinge, John. x.
ye he yt is not the sheperde, nor owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming,
and forsakes the sheep, ye flies, and the wolf catches and scatters the
sheep. Such hyrelynges, O good Lord, Acts. xx. Roma. xvi. Philip. iii. ii.
Peter. ii.
take away from us, which seek nothing but idelly to live of the sweet of our
brows, and of ye labor of our hands, and notwythstandynge suffer us to be
miserabli torn of antichrist and of his Ministers, John. x.
both by their tirannye, and false doctrine. A thief comes not but to steal,
to sley, and to destroy. Take away from us, O good Jesus those thieves which
steal away the livings of ye true shepherds, which sley our souls for want
of thy holy word, and destroy us with their corrupt manners, wicked living,
and most detestable co^uersacion. Take away from us those heardemen, (...). xi.
yea rather those Idols as thy Prophet calls the^, which are not reside^t
upon their benefices, nor give atte^dau^ce upon their cure, but forsake their
flock, and yet rob from them all that they may catch, and give us such pastors
as will watch upon their flock, abide among the^, teach them thy blessed word,
feed the^ with hospitality, lead a godli life, bring up their youth
virtuously, and be at all times ready, if thy glory, and the health of their
parishioners requires to bestow their life. Take away from us al those
curates, (...)* lvi.
which are blind, with out knowledge, dumme dogs not able to bark, which
have pleasure to behold vain things, and love to ly snortyng and dreaming. Most
vnshamefaced dogs are they, they have never enough, although they heap
benefice upon benefice, prebende upon prebende, deanerye upon deanery never so
much. Iere^y. vi*
For all are wholly bent unto covetousness, even from the highest unto the
lowest, and the things that they get, spend they in banketting, and in vain
plesures. Take away from us those false prophets, Math. vi^.
which come unto us in shepes clothes, but inwardly are ravening wolves. Take a
way those false anointed, and falls preachers, which by their subtle doctrine
go about to bring us into error, Mat. xxiii.
and teach us not to seek the with true faith in heaven, where thou sytteste
on the right hand of God thy father, but in the cloister, andin the pixe.
Mark. xvi. Luk xxiiii. Acts. i, Heb^u. i.
Take away from us those grievous wolves, which are entered in among us, and
spare not ye flock but speak perverse things, that they may lead away the
faythefull after them. ^ctes* xx.
Take away from us al those men pleasers, which by their fair speech, and
flattering words, deceive the hertes of the simple, Rom^. xvi.
by this means serving their bellye and not the, O Lord Jesus Christ. ^^la. v.
Take away from us those iusticiaries, which teach that we are justified by the
works of the law, and not by faith alone in our Lord God. Ah Lord, if our
iustifi^acion comes of works, then did thou dye in vain. But whosoever
seeks to be justified by works, is utterly fallen from the grace and favor of
god. For we know that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by
the faith of the our lord Jesus Christ: G^l^ ii.
and we have believed in ye, o Lord, that we might be justified by the faith
that we have in the, and not by the works of the law, because no man shall be
instified by y^ works of the law. Philip. iii.
Take away from us those dogs, those evil workemenne, those shauelings,
which teach, Hebru. ix.^
y^ thou by the one only oblacion of thy body haste not made perfect for ever
them y^ are sanctified. Enemies are they of the cross of Christ, Phili. iii.
whose end is destruccyon whose God their belly is. Take away from us these
falls doctors which privily bring in damnable sects and deny the the Lord, ii.
Peter. ii.
which has bought them, through whom the way of truth is evil spoken of,
and through covetousness with their disceit full words make merchandise of us,
whose judgment is not far of, and whose dampnacio^ slepeth not. Take away
from us those false prophets and spirits of Antichrist, i. Ihon. iiii
which teach that thou ye Lord Jesus Christ tokest no flesh of that blessed and
undefiled virgyn Marye thy mother. Take away from us ye proud whore of
Babylon, ^poc. xvii.
that great and blasphemous baude of all the whordoms and abhominacions of the
earth with whom even the very kings of the earth have played the whore mongers,
and they that dwelt on the earth were made d^o^cke^ with the wine of her
whoredo^. Down o Lord with that purpled and rose colored whore, decked with
gold, pearl and precious stones, having a golden cup in her hand, full of
the abhomynacions and fylthynes of her wantonness. Down, o lord with that
gorgyous stro^pet, which is drunk with the blood of saynctes, and with the
blood of thy Martirs, O Jesus. Let that whore behated of al men, let her be
desolate, Apo. xviii.
comfortless and naked, yea let the very flesh of her be gnawen of, and she
consumed with fire. Let that great Babylon be made a dwelling place of
devils, and an hold of al unclean spirits, and a cage of all filthy, and
hateful birds. For of the wine of her pestilent whordome have al nations
dronken, yea the very kings of the earth have committed whoredom with her, and
the Merchants of the earth have waxen rich through her wantonne pleasures.

O Lord take away from us these Marchaunts, that give attendau^ce upon that
filthy whore, and deceive the whole world with their peltyng pedlary, thieuyshe
trashe and masking marchaundyse. Let their wares be soulde no more, but
boothe they and their bloody whoryshe Mastresse taken away from us, so yt we be
no more deceived by them nor the truth of thy glorious gospel conde^pned for
heresy, nor yet the blood of the saynctes any more shed. O Lord take away
from us al these aforesayed monstures eue^ so many as deface thy glory, corrupt
thy blessed word despise thy flock, and taking up on them to be feders, feed
the^ selves and not thy sheep: (...). xxxiii.
and in their stead place good Bishops, learned prechers, christen ministers,
faithful teachers, true spiritual fathers, even such as bren with a fervent
and unfeigned zele toward the setting forth of thy glory and the health of thy
people. Indue them with thy holy spirit, that they may be faithful and wise
servant, giving thy household meat in due season, Mat. xxiii. Luke* xii.
Give them that thy wysdom, which no man is able to resyst, wherwyth also they
may be able both to exhort with wholesome doctrine, Lu^e. xxi.
and also to convince and overcome the^ yt speak against it. Let repentance
and remission of sins be preached of the^ in thy name among al nations. Luke.

Give the^ grace to persevere in thy truth unto the end. Mat. x. (...) xxiiii.
Grant also, O Lord, that they may truly and reverently minister unto us thy

made strong against ye gates of hell, ye devil, the world, the flesh, the curse
of the law, Eccles. iiii
sin death, desperacion, and all that is enemi unto us. Let not their hand be

among them in maintening ho^pitality for the relief of the pore, Hospitali^^.
that they may be found feders of the f^ock both in word and deed. Mala. iii.
For thou (O Lord) commaundest by ye prophet in the old law, that al tithe
should be brought into thy barn, that there might be meat in thy house. Thou
call ye preachers barn* No^^.
thy barn, and his house thy house* And unto this end woldst thou have
temporal things provided for thy preachers, that they might have whereof to
live them selfs, to feed their family, and also to comfort the pore of the
parish. To feed with word and not with work profits litel To fill ye ear with the
sound of words, and to suffer ye body starve for honger, is not the part of a
good shepperde. He is not a good herdeman that stands, al day whystlynge and
calling at his sheep, but he that drives the^ unto sweet and pleasant
pastures where they may eat their bellyes full. i. Timo. ii. Titu, i.
Thy holy Apostle commands a Bishop or spiritual minister to maintein
hospitality. Thou also which art ye mirroure of al goodness and liueli exa^plare
of al true pastors, being in this world conuersau^t among me^, and a preacher
of thy heavenly fathers blessed will, Mat. xiiii. and.xv, Mark. vi. Luke. ix.
John, vi,
feddest ye people not only with thy godly doctrine, but also with corporal food,
giving an example unto al spiritual pastors, yt they should do so likewise.
Thou co^mau^dest also thy blessed apostle Peter. iii. to feed thy flock, Ihon.
xxi.
yt is first with the pure doctrine of thy heavenly gospel, where unto thy holy
sacraments sure seals are annexed for ye co^firmacio^ of thy truth. Secondly
with godly conversation and a life agreeable to the doctrine, that the
parishioners may the sooner be allured unto manners worthy of ye gospel. Thirdly
with hospitality. And this commau^deme^t gave thou not only unto Peter, but
unto al other thy Apostels, yea and to al spiritual pastors that have or shall
succed the^ unto the end of ye world, Acts, vi.
that thy pore people may be fed both body and soul. Roma. xv.
This commandment (O sweet Jesus (was diligently executed of the holy
Apostels, ii. Cor i* ix.
and of the faithful ministers that succeeded the^, Acts, xx.
which al were moved with so great and so tender compassion toward thy pore
members, ii. Cor. xi.
that they did not only feed them with such goods as they received of ye
christian congregation, i. Thessa. ii.
i. These. iiii
but also to satisfye their lack, they wrought with their hands But o Lord this
louinge pity toward the pore in these our days is greatly abated, and waxes
utterly cold in many of the Ministers of thy church, which notwtstandynge are
them selfs very wealthy, and live all in pleasure of the church goods, so
that by this means they are not reside^t upon their benifices, they maintain
no hospitalyty, the parisheners are robbed of their duties, and the pore are
not fed with meat as thou haste commanded, but they rather miserably sterue
for honger. Unto such shepherds as feed them selfs and not ye flock, Ez^c.
xxxiii
as eat the milk, are clad with the wolle, and eat of ye fattest of the
flock, and yet feed not ye sheep, you threatnest dampnacyon by the prophet,
promising that thou thy self wylt upon the shepherdes, and require thy sheep
from their hands and make them cease from fedinge of thy sheep. Yea you say
moreover that the shepperdes shall feed them selfs no more, for thou will
deliver thy sheep out of their mouths, so that they shall not devour them
after this. Thou promisest also to set faithful shepperdes over thy flock, and
quietly to place thy sheep in grene, fat and pleasant pastures so that the
beasts of the fyelde shall devour them no more, but they shall dwell safely
without any fear, neither shall they any more be famished with ho^ger, nor yet
bear the spyteful words of the heathen For thou their Lord God will take
care of the^. Deal with thy flock (O most faytheful sheppeard) according to
thy promise. i. Cori. xi.
Drive away from among us al rauenynge wolfes and deceitful hypocrites which
are the Ministers of Satan* changing the^ selfs into aungelles of light,
and appoynte faythefull and dylygent heardmen over thy flock, which may feed
them with thy lively word, lead a good life* and maynetaine hospitalyty among
them for the comfort of the pore, and in all things so behave them them selfs
according to thy blessed will and com^aundemente, that when thou the most high
Bishop and chyefe shepparde shalt appear, i, Peter. v.

A prayer for Gentlemenne.
AL be it what soever is borne of flesh is flesh, Ihon. iii.
and all that we receive of our natural parents is earth, dust, ashes and
corruption, Genesi. iii,
so that no child of Adam has any cause to boste him self of his birth and
blood, ^ccle. vii.x
seeing we have al one flesh and one blood, begotten in sin, Psalm. ii.
conceived in uncleanness, and borne by nature the children of wrath, Ephesi. ii,
yet for as much as some for their wysdom, godlynes, virtue, valeau^ce,
strength, eloquence, learning and policy be auaunced above the common sort of
people unto dignities and temporal promocyons, as men worthy to have
superiorite in a christian comu^ weal, and by this means have obtained among
the people a more noble and worthy name: John, i,
We most entyrely beseech the, from whom alone comes the true nobility to so
many as are born of ye, Galath, iii,
and made thy sons through faith, whether they be rich or poor, noble or
unnoble, to give a good spirit to our superiors, that as they be called
gentlemen in name, so they may show them selves in all their doings, gentle,
curteus, loving, pitiful, and liberal unto their inferiores, living among them
as natural fathers among their children, not polling, pillyng, and oppressing
them, but favoring, helping, and cheryshing them, not destroyers, but fathers
of the country, not enemies to the pore, but ayders, helpers, and co^forters of
them, that when thou shalt call them from this vale of wretchedness, they before
showing ge^tlenes to the common people, may receive gentelnes again at thy
merciful hand, eue^ everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

THe earth is thine, o lord, and all that is contained therein, Psalm* xxiiii
Psalm. cxv,
notwithstanding thou haste given the possessyon thereof unto the children of

themselves to be thy tenau^ts, may not rack and s^retch out the re^ts of their

covetous worldlings, but so let them out to other yt the inhabitauntes thereof
may both be able truly to pay ye re^tes, and also honestly to live, to nour^sh
their familye, and to relief the pore. Give them grace also to consider that
they are but strangers and pilgrims in this world, Psa. xxxix, i. Peter, ii.
having here no dwelling place, but seki^g one to come, yt they remembering ye
short continuau^ce of their life, may be content, with yt is sufficient, and
not join house to house, nor couple la^d to la^d to ye empouerishment of

O Almightye god maker and disposer of all things, which have placed thy

and that unto this end yt al kinds of men should be knit together in unity and

where they dwell, and to give the^ saf passage both in their going and coming,
yt they having prosperous iourenyes may show them selfs tha^kful to the, and

A Prayer for Lawyers.
(...), vii. i. Timot. i.
WE know, o Lord, that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully, given of
the as a singular gift unto ye children of men for mayntenance of godly orders,
for putting away of iniquities and wrongs, for restoryng of men unto their
right, for the auauncement of virtue and punishment of vice: we most hertely
pray the, which art ye law geuer, Jacob. iiii.
which alone is able to save and to destroy, ^ccles^* i,
from whom also comes al wisdom, prudence, and knowledge, so to rule through
the governance of thy holy spirit the hearts of al lawyers, that they hering
men's causes, being in co^trouersy, with discrecio^, and indiffere^cy, and weying
the^ justly and truly according to the tenore and equity of the law, may
without parciality both faithfully give counsel, and also indifferentlye
pronounce of al such causes as be brought unto the^, and by no means suffer
them selfs to be corrupted with bribes and gifts, Ecclesi. xx. Deuteronomy, xvii.
which blind the eyes of the wise, and subvert true judgment, but walk so
uprightly in all men's matters, yt they seking with godli travels a quietness among
me^ in this world, may after their departure from this troubelouse vale of
misery enjoy everlasting rest and quietness in ye heavenly ma^sio^, through Jesus
Christ our lord.

A Prayer for poor people.
AS riches, so likewise poverty is thy gift, o Lord. Ecclesi^. x.

godly to die, the^ unjustly or by force to get any man's goods, and by no
means enui, murmur, or grudge against such as it has pleased the to endue
with more abundance of worldly substau^s, but knowing their state, although
never so humble and base to be of the their lord God, and that thou will not
forsake them in this their need, but send them things necessary for their pore
life, may contynuallye praise the, and hope for better things in the world to
come, through thy son Jesus Christ our lord. AMEN.

A prayer for the Commons.
Roma. xiii.
THou have commanded, O lord in thy holy scriptures, that all subjects should

for there is no power but of the. The powers that be, are ordained of the:
whosoever therefore resists the power, resists thy ordinance, and they that
resyste, shall get to the^ selfs damnacion. Wherefore we knowing this thy
commau^demente and notwithstanding not ignorant of the works, and subtilties
of the Devil, which laboreth to ye uttermost of his power to drive out of men's
herts true and faithful obedyence toward their superiors, and in the stead
thereof to plant disobedience, rebellion, sedicion, tumult, co^mocio^
insurreccion, and whatsoever may trouble a christian common weal, and break thy
holy ordinance, most humbly and from the very heart beseech the to grave in the
hertes of the common people faithful, true and unfeigned obedience both toward
our king; and toward the other rulers that are sent of him for the
punishment of evil doers, i. Pet. ii.
but for the praise of the^ that do well: grant them also O most mercyefull

A prayer for the unmarried,
ALbeit most merciful father, marriage is honorable among all persons and the
bed undefiled, Hebr. xiii.
yet for as much as some tho^owe thine exceadynge and above natural gift (for
no man can hue chaste, Sapi. viii.
except y^ give hi^ ye gift) live free from the sweet yocke of m^trimony, some

so train their life in godly exercises, that thou mayeste goo forth to
continue and increase that thy gift in them, i. Cor. vii.
that they may the more freely and quyetlye serve the, and care for those
things that perteine unto thy glory: Again, that the other passing over the
time of their young age in thy fear, in godly travails, and virtuous labors,
may exchue al evil, wicked, riotous, and wa^ton company, that when they shall
take on them the holy and honorable order of blessed wedlock, they may bring

A prayer for them that be married.
Among other thy creatures (O everlasting God) when thou had made man
according to thine own similytude, Gene. i.v.
lykenes and image, Gene. ii.
thou saydest: it is not good that man be alone: let us make him a healper like
unto him self, and shortly after thou formedst a woman of the man's rib, and
broughtest her unto Adam, which said: This now is bone of my bones, and
flesh of my flesh. She shall be called a woman, for she is taken of man. ^
Wherefore man shall forsake father and mother, and cleave unto his wife, and
they shall be, ii, in one flesh, And thou blessing them gave them
commandment, Gene. ii.
saying: En^rese and multiply, and fulfill the earth. Here learn we (o
heavenly father) that thou art the author of marriage, and that so many as mary
in thy fear, are coupled together of the, Math. xix.
blessed and defended, and that thou have joined them together to this end,
that they should encrese the earth and bring forth so^s and daughters unto the
glory of thy name. Thy holy apostle also commands, i, Cor. vii.
yt to avoid fornicacion every man should have his own wife and every woman
her own husband, so that if they ca^ not live single they should mary, for it
is better to mary then to burn. Here learn we again (O heavenly father) that
thou have ordained matrimonye to be as alue unto the infirmytye and weakness of
our flesh and haste given it as a present remedy unto us against the raginge
lusts of old Adam, that we taking upon us the holy order of Matrimony, and
by this means exchuing whoredom and al uncleanness, ^uke* ^.
might serve the in holiness and pureness all the days of our life. We therefore
considering how grievous an offense it is before thy divine Majesty for such as
be married dissolutely to live, and contrary unto their professyon to abuse them
selfs, most hertelye pray the, favorably to behold all such as have taken
upon them the yocke of honorable wedlock, and to give the^ grace to order
their life according to thy holy word. Grant (O merciful Lord) that the
married men be not bitter, that is, Colos. ii^.
churlishe and unkind unto their wives but love them as thy dearly beloved
son Christ loved the faithful congregation, Eph^. ^.
provide for them, defend them, and cherishe them even as they cherysh their
own bodies, i. Pete. iii.
again, dwell with them according to knowledge, geuynge honor unto the wife
as unto the weaker vessel, and as unto them that are heirs also of the grace
of life, that every one of them auoydyng fornicacion and knowing how to keep
his vessel in holiness and honor, i. Tess. iiii.
and not in the lust of concupilence, as do the heathen that know not God, may
by their godly conuersacio^ show the^ selves to have taken upon the^ the holy
order of Matrimony not at the prouocacion of ye flesh, bu^ through the mocion of
thy holy spirit. Grant also yt the wives b^ obedient and submit them selfs
unto their own husbands, Ephe. v.
in all honest and godly things, L^k^. iii,
that they which believe not the word, may without the word be won by the
conuersacio^ of their wives while they behold their pure conversation coupled
with ferae. 1. Peter. iii
^. Timo. ii.
Give the^ grace also to array them s^lfes i^ comely apparel, i. Peter. iii
with shamefastenes and descrete behave ou^, not with broyded hea^e, other
gold, or pearls or costly array, but with such as becomes weme^ that
profess the worshippinge of God through good works* that the hid man of the
heart be vncorrupt, with a meke and quiet spirit, which spir^t is before God a
thing much set by. Again, grant, O Lord, that both the husbands and the
wives may so walk in thy fear and in thy holy law, that thou maiste have a
pleasure in them, bless the^ prospere their enterpryses, make them frutfull and
joyful parents. Finally, the children that thou se^dest the^, give the^ grace
so to bring vpin thy nourter and doctrine, Ephe. vi,
that they living together many years does joyfully and quietly may with one
voice and with one mind gloryfy thy blessed name for ever. ame^.

A prayer for women with child.
THou, O Lord, art wonderful in all thy works, and whatso ever thy good pleasure
is that do thou easly bring to pas, Psa. cxv.
nether is any thing impossible with the, that thou will have done. Mathe. xix.
Mark. x.
And albeit this thine almyghty-power shows it self abundantlye in all thy
works, Luke. xviii
yet in the co^ce^nyng forming and bryngyng forth of m^n, it shines no^te

woman, thou co^maundest them to increase, multiply and replenish the earth. If
through ye subt^le entiseme^te^ of Satan, Ge^. i.ix.
they had not tra^sgressed thy commandment by eating the forbydde^ fruit,
the woman, whom thou haste appoyncted the organ, (...). iii. i. Tim. ii.
instrument, and vessel to conceive, norishe and bring forth man through thy
wond^rful workma^shippe, had without any la^oure, pain or travail brought
forth her fruit. But that whych^ thy goodness made easy, syn and
disobedience has made hard, painful, dangerous, and if thy help were not,
impossible to be brought to pass: Genesis iii.
so that now al women bring forth their children in great sorrows, pains and
troubles. Psa. xlviii.
Notwithstanding y^ show thy self unto thy creatures a father of mercy,

of thy present help, of thy sweet comfort in all miseryes and necessities,
knowing also by the testimonies of thy holy word how greatand intolerable
the pains of women are ye trauail of child, if through thy tender mercies they

son and our lord, that thy loving kyndne^se may make that easy and
tolerable, which sin has made hard and paynefull. Ease* o lord you pains,
which thou most ryghteouslye haste put upon al women for the syn and
dysobedience of our graund mother Eve, Genesi. iii.
in whom al we have sinned, and give unto al such as have conceived and be with
child, strength to bring forth that, which thou wonderfully have wrought in
the^. Be present with the^ in their trouble, help them and deliver the^. Let
thy power be showed no less in the safe bringing forth, the^ in the wonderful
fashioning of the child, ye that which ye haste begun in them, may come unto
good success. Make them glad and joyful mothers, yt they through thy goodness
being safely delivered, and restored to their old strenghthes, may live and
praise thy blessed name for ever. Amen.

A thankesgeuynge unto God for their delyueraunce.
AMong other thy benefytes, yea and those innumerable, which thou daily
bestowest upon us thy nedy and pore creatures, this is not the least, o most
merciful father, that thou of thy tender goodness do vouchsafe for the
conseruacion of mankind to preserve the women that are with child, and to give
the^ safe deliverance of their burden, by this means making them glad and
wyfull mothers. For this thy benefyt and good will toward us, we so heartily
thank the, as heart can think, besechinge the to work such tha^kefulnesse
in the harte^ of al mothers by thy holy spyryte, that they being not
vnmindeful of this high benefyt of their safe deliverance, wrought only by the
the savior of al man kind, may show them selfs thankful unto the for
this thy goodness* and never forget that thy present help and most sweet
comfort which thou mercyfully shewedst upon the^ in their great trauayles,
Psalm, l.
Pro. xviii.
labors and pains when they fled unto thy holy name for succor, as unto a
strong bulwark and holy defense. Go forth, o Lord, Psa. cxiiii.
to make them the joyful mothers of many children. Endue them with long life,
Ps. cxxviii
that they may se then childres children. And the children that thou geueste
unto the^, Luke. i, ii.
make thou as in age, so likewise in wisdom and in the abundaunce of thy
holy spirit to increase, that they may have favor both with the, and with
all good men, unto the glory of thy most blessed name. Amen.

A prayer for Fathers and Mothers.
FOR as much O heavenly father, Ps^. xviii.
as thou haste dealte with the children of men more nobly then with brute
beasts and with other thy creatures by giving them not only, an amiable body*
but also a mind, which is immortal and never shall die, Gene. i. Sapi. ii.
and for the garnyshyng of the same, that it may be made like unto the
similitude, like nes and Image of the, have in thy holy law commanded all
fathers and mothers, Deu. iiii.xi Eccle vii.^ xxx.xl.ii. Ephe. vi. Tit* ii.
whom thou haste blessed with the gift of children to take dilligent care for
the virtuous bringyng up of their sons and daughters, that they may learn
even from their very cradels to know the their Lord God, to believe in the, to
fear and love thee, to call upon thy blessed name, to be tha^kfull unto the,
and to walk in thy holy commandments all the days of their life: We
knowing how froward evil disposed* and untoward the heart, Gene. viii.
wit and disposicion of man is even from his very youth, if it be not
restrained with the byt of thy most blessed law, hertely pray the to give al
fathers and mothers grace after the example of Abraham, Gene. xviii. ii. Reg.
ii. Tob. i.^iii. i. Math. ii. Dani. ^iii. Acts. xxi. ii. Tim iii.
David, Tobi, Mathathias, the pare^tes of Susan, Philip the Evangelist, and
such other, to bring up their children, even from their very infa^ci, in thy
fear, in thy nourture, and in the knowledge of thy most healthful word, that
they sekyng no less the garnishinge of their childre^s minds with learning
and virtue, the^ the preserui^g of their bodies with fode and raiment, may show
them selves profitable members of the christen public weal, and faithful
servants to the their Lord God, which alone art worthy all honor, and
glory. Amen.

A prayer for children.
AS thou (O mercyful father) have given commandment unto al fathers* and
mothers to br^nge up their children in thy fear, nourtour and doctrine* so
likewise thy good pleasure is, yt children should honor and reverence their
parents, E^odu. ix. Deute. v. Mathe. xix. Mar x. E^he. ^i. Collo. iii. Eccl
iii.vi^ Tobi. iiii. Eccle. iii. Prove. xix. Prove. xxx. Deu. xxvii.
diligently give ear unto their v^rtuous enstruccions, and faithfully obey
them. And as thou have promised health, honor, glory, rych^s, long life, and
all that good is unto the^ that honor, reverence, and humbly obey their
fathers and mothers, so haste thou threatened vnt o dysobedye^t children,
ignominy, evil fame, contempt, shame, dishonor poverty, sickness, short
life, and such other plagues. Yea in thy holy law thou do not only
pronounce them accurssed that dyshonor their fathers and mothers, but thou also
commaundest, that if any child be stubberne and disobedient and will not
hear, but rather despise the commandment of his father and mother* Deute.
xxi.
ye same should be stoned unto death without mercy, so greatly doste thou
abhor disobedience and rebellion against all persons, but specially against
parents. Deute. iiii. Heb. xiii.
We therefore heartily wishyng, that the plages of thy fearce wrath (for thou O
God art a consum^ng fire) may be far from us* most humbly beseech the to grave
in ye hearts of all children of what^oeuer age kind, estat or degree they be true
honor, harti reverence* and unfeigned obedyence toward their p^rentes. Give
them grace, o good Lord, that as they profes thy son Christ in name, so they
may truly represent his manners in their life and conversation, Luke. ii.
which willinglye was obedient unto his mother mary and unto her husband
Joseph geuyng example to al children of the like subieccion and obedience
tow^rd their parents. Engraffe in them such a love toward their fathers and
mothers, that they may both reverence the^ with outward honor, and also for
their power help them, socoure the^, provide for them, comfort anb cherish
the^ in their need, eue^ as their parents nourished and comforted the^ in their
infancy and tender age. Esaias. xliii.
But above all things give the^ grace truly to honor the, which art ye
heavenly father, yea our father and our redemer, which have made us, and
daily cherishest us even as a father or mother cherishe their most dear and
natural children. So shall ^t come to pass, Esaye. xlix.
that they faithfully honourynge the, shall also in order, heartily honor and
unfeignedly obey their carnal pare^tes in thy fear, unto y^ glory of thy most
blessed name, which is most worthi to be honored worlds without end. Ame^.

A prayer for Masters.
Although (O Christ thou most highest Lord) al power both in heaven and in
earth, M^t xxviii
be given unto the of thy heavenly father, and albeit thou have given us a
commandment, that we should not desire to be called master, Mat. xxiii.
for we have but one master, which you art, and al we are brethren having one
father which is in heaven, yet forasmuch as thou according to thy blessed will
have appoi^ted some superiors, some inferioures, some masters, some servant,
some to command some to obey, some to rule, some to searue, and by this
means such as be in superiorytye have obtained by thy holy word, the name
of masters, or Lords, because they have servants under them, and rule under
the according to thy good pleasure, and godly appointment, which art the
most supreme power, and most excellent majesty King of kings, and Lord
of Lords, i. Timo. vi. Apoc. ^vii. and.xix.
to whom all things both in heaven, and in earth, and under the earth do bow
their knees, and give reverence, and honor, Philip. ii.
whose praise also every nation and language does auance and set forth,
confessing that thou art the Lord Jesus Christ, unto the glory of God the
father: We most humblye pray thee, which art the greatest master, and most
highest Lord, to send thy holy spirit upon all such as are called masters
here in earth, and have superiority over other, that they remembrynge them
selves to be thy servant, Ephesi. vi. Collo. iiii.
and that they also have a master in heaven, with who^ there is no respect of
persons may put away all threatninges, al cruelty, al unrighteousness, and do
that unto their seruau^ts, which is just and equal. Eccle. vii.
Grant that they entreat not evil their servants which work truly, nor
the hyreling that is faithful unto the^. Eccle. iiii. Eccle. vii.
Grant that they be not as lions in their houses, destroyinge their household
folks, and oppressing such as are under them, but rather that they cherysh and
love their faithful and discrete servants, even as their own soul, and by
no means suffer the^ to be unrewarded for their pains taki^g, nor yet at the
last to be driven to beggary for their true service doing, but that they
liberally rewarding them according to their deserts, may show the^ selves to
be thy true servants, which leauest no man unrewarded, Math. xvi.
but geuest to eueri man according to his deeds, Roma. ii.
to them that do well, and continue in well doing, glory, honor, peace
immortality, and everlasting life, to them that do evil, and continue in the
same, indignacion, wrath, displesure, trouble, sorrow, and eternal damnacio^.
Grant therefore (O Lord) that all temporal masters may in all their doyngs
resemble the, which art the heavenly and everlasting master, and so be have
the^ selfs both toward their seruau^ts and all other accordnig to thy blessed
will, that at the last day they may be found in the number of the^ to whom
thou shall say: Come ye blessed of mi father possess the kingdom which was
prepared for you from the beginning of the world: Math. xxv.
Lord let it so come to pass. Amen.

A prayer for servants.
O Christ my lord and savior, which being the son of the living God, yea God
him self from everlasting, did not disdain at the will of thine heavenly
father to make thy self of no reputation, to become man, to take upon the the
shape of a servant, and to obey thy fathers commandment to the death,
Philip. ii.
yea even the death of ye cross for our salvation, refusi^g no service, no
trauail, no labor, no pain, yt might make unto the comfort of mankind: we
most humbly beseech the to give al seruau^ts grace to practice thy humility
and obedyence, that as thou most wyllyngly did serve, and obey thy
heavenly fathers good pleasure, so they in like manner may with most hartye
affeccio^ serve and obey their bodily masters in all things, Ephesi. vi.
that fight not with thy blessed word, not with eye service as men pleasers, but
in singlenes of heart, fearing God, that what so ever they do, Coloss. iiii.
they may do it heartily eue^ as unto the lord and not unto men, forasmuch as
they are sure, that they shall receive the reward of the heavenly enherytaunc^ of
the o lord Christ, who^ also they serve, while truly and faithfullye they
serve their bodily masters. Grant that so many as are under the yoke, may
count their masters worthy of all honor, that the name of god and his
doctrine be not evil spoken of, and obey the^ with all fear, Tit ii.
not only if they be good and courteous, i. Peter. ii.
but also though they be froward, and please the^ in all things, not answering
the^ again, Tit. ii.
nor picki^g ought from the^, but show al good faythfulnesse, that in all
things they may do worship unto the doctrine of the our god and saueout, to
whom with the holy ghost be al honor* praise and glory, for ever. Amen.

A prayer for them that are sick.
O Jesus the savior of ye world, and the true Physician both of the body and of
the soul, Math. ix.
we are not altogether ignorante how detestable a thing sin is in thy sight
and how greatli thou abhorrest them that commyt i^^quitye and shake of the yoke
of thy law, Psalm. v.
giving their minds to the filthy lusts of the flesh, and the vain
pleasures of the world, Some that thus ungodly behave them selfs, thou
suffer to go forth still in their be as^like manners without correccion or
punishment to live in pleasure and wantonness upon the earth, Jacob. v. Philip.
iii.
to noryshe their hearts as in a day of slaughter, to serve their belly as
their God, and voluptuouslye to spend their days without all fear of the,
that at the last, they being altogether nousled in voluptuousnes and dying
without repentance (for the sorrows, Psa. cxiiii.
plages and punyshments of the wicked begin at their death) may with that
rich and beastlike gloton be tormented for ever in the flames of hell fire. For
convenient it is that they which in this world live, all in pleasure, Luke, xvi.
do in another world receive their pains, even as thou haste promised in thy
holy Gospel saying. Woe be to you that are full, for ye shall hongre, Woe be
to you y^ now laughe, for ye shall wayl and weep. Again some that walk
inordinatli* Luke. vi.
and contrary to the rules of thy holy law, thou tendryng their salvation
visitest them with syckenes their and punishest their bodies with the loving
rod of thy correction* yt they may no longer be proud, cruel and fearce
against the spyryte, whose servant and bond slave the body of right ought
to be, but rather be obedient and service able, that it may from h^nsforthe not
so much as once lust against the spirit, and by this means thou mercifulli
call them (which as wanderyng sh^pe, Luke, ^v.
have so long strayed abroad) home again unto thy shepefold^. For this. O Lord,
is an evident toke^ of thine exceadynge goodness and tender mercy toward us,
when thou seeing us most grievously through our wicked and synneful conversation
to offend thy divine Majesty, to forsake thy law, not too walk in thy
ordinan^ces, to break thy statutes, not to keep thy commandments, Ps. ^xxxix.
do not take away from us thy loving kindness but vysytest our iniquityes
with thy gentyl rod, and punysheste our sins with thy correccions sweet to
the spirit, i. Cor. xi.
but bitter to to the flesh (for while we are punished we are corrected of ye
lord least we should with this world be co^de^pned) and by this means thou
prouokeste us to leave our ryotous and ungodly manners, and to seek after the
our most loving savior, leadynge a life from henseforthe, according to thy
most blessed will and commandment. Some also thou throweste into
adversity, and punyshest with syckenesse to prove and try their faith, whether
they be constante in confessing, calling upon, and praisinge thy holy name,
like unto that pacyent man and faythefull warryoure, which said.

If we have received good and prosperous things at the lords hand, Job. i.
why should we not be content to suffer evil and troublous things? The Lord
gave them, the Lord has taken them away, as it pleased the lord, so is it
come to pass, blessed be the name of the Lord. So many, O Lord, as thou
love, thou sometime visitest with thy louinge rod of correccio^, least that
they continually enioyenge y^ to much felicity and wealth of worldely
things, should forgette the their Lord God, and walk in the vanities of a
lewd mind. Heb. xii.
For if we endure chasteni^ge, thou offerest thy self unto us as unto sons.
Prouer. iii
Apoca. iii.
For who^ thou love, him thou chastnest, yea and thouscourgest every son
that thou receyuest? Hebru. xii.
what son is that who^ the father chastneth not, if we be not under
correccion, whereof all are partakers then a^e we bastard^ and not s^ns. And
albeit no manner chastising for the present time seems to be ioious but
grievous, nevertheless afterward it brings the quiet fruit of righteousness
unto them, which are exer^ised therein. Forasmuch (therefore O most merciful
savior) as sickness and aduersyty is sent from the unto the children of men
for their great profyt and singular commodity, even that the body with the
works thereof should be subject to the spirit, and as a witness, and zele of
thy loving kindness and hearty good will toward them, we most hartelye pray the
mercyefullye to behold all such as are sick, and as that pytyfull
Samaritane, to pour wine and oil into their wounds, Luke. ^.
and to bynd them up, that is, to comfort them, giving them grace patiently to
bear the cross that thou have laid upon them, to show the^ selfs conformable
to thy blessed will, and in the myds of their trouble and syckenesse to praise
thy glorious name, and with strong faith to say: Ose. vi.
come and let us return unto the lord for he has begun and he will heal us,
he has strike^ us, and he will sureli make us whole. For it is the Lord that
brings down to the grave and fetches up again. Deu. xxxii. i. Reg. ii.
It is the Lord that punysheth with pouertye, Tobi. xiii.
and makes welthy again. Sapi. xvi.
It is the lord that ^ringeth low, and lifts up again, yea it is the lord
that kills, and makes alive again. It is for our great profit, Psalm. cxix.
that the Lord has thus plaged us, eue^ that we should learn to forsake our
own fleshly will, and to walk in his holy ordinances: Therefore as it is gods
good pleasure, Mat. xxvi.
so let it come to pas. His will be done, and not ours. Psalm. ^c^.
We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture, let him deal with us, as
seems best in his godly sight. Romans xiiii.
For whether we live or die, we are the Lords. Give the^ grace O sweet Jesus,
thus to be persuaded of thy good will even in the mids of the shadow of death,
that they fai^t not under the cross, and become of a desperate mind* but
valeantly abide thy good pleasure, and all the time of their trouble and sickness
patiently and tha^kfully t^ call upon thy blessed name, which is a strong tower
for all the^ that f^ee unto it, Pro. xviii.
and euersette before their eyes thy louinge kyndnes, beleui^g steadfastly, that
although their cross be pai^ful to the flesh, yet is it sweet to the spirit,
and al be it the outward manne be made weak through it, yet is the inward
manne made strong; which wysheth to be losoned from this wretched body,
Philip. i.
and to be with the in glory. For so long as we are at home in the bodi, we
are absente from the fruicion and syghte of thy divine majesty. ii. Corin. i.
O Lord it is not thy property alwai to chide, Psa. iiii.
alwai to be angri, nether to deal with us according to our sins, nor yet to
reward us after our in inquities: but as a tender father pitieth his natural
son, so art thou merciful to sinners, if they repent, Match. x.
believe, and amend. For thou ca^mest into this world not to call the ryghteous,
but sinners to repentance. Neither art thou a physician for the whole, but for
the sick. Be thou therefore, O most merciful Savior, a physician to such as
ar diseased ^ther body or some, and after this thy loving correccio^, restore
unto the^ ye benefit of health, both corporally and spirituallye. Make whole so
many as knowledge their miseris, repent them of their sinful manners, flee unto
the for succor, believing to enjoy all good things at thy merciful hand. And as
thou have made them heavy with laying thy cross upon them, so make thou them
ioiful by restoryng unto the^ the gift of health, that they may live and
glorify thy blessed name for ever. Amen.

A prayer for Souldioures.
IN the whole body of the holy scripture (O Jesus* thou son of the living God
(there is nothing more commended and setforthe unto us then peace, unity,
quietness and concord. Unto this Moses and the Prophets, thou and thine
Apostels do diligently exhort, Gene. lxiii. Job. xxii. Iere. xxix. ^achar ix.

For what is more semely for man, then to embrace amyable peace, Luke. ii.

But Satan that old enemy of mankind, which goth about like a roaring lion,

For thou haste given a commaundment to thy creaturs and none shall go beyond
it. Fire, hail, snow, ise, and vapors, stormy winds accomplish the word.
Thou have limited ye waters their bounds, Psalm. ^iiii.

thy disciples were, was grievously tossed with ye waves, Mat. viii. Mark. iiii.
Luke. v.
and at the point of drownyng through the wynd and tempest yt arose, causedst at
the desire of thy disciples the wynd to cese, the sea to be quiet, and a
great calm to be made, in so much that they which were in the ship marueyled,
and said: What man is this, that both winds, and the sea obey him? Grant
therefore (o most gentle savior that whensoever any troubleouse tempest
arises in the sea, so that through it such as ar upon the sea be endanger,

troble and aduersitye fle for refuge unto thy holy name as unto a strong hold,
and mighty fortres, we ca^ not but confess and acknowledge thy singular
kindenes and unspeakable good will, which you continually through thy fatherly
goodness bear toward thyseruauntes, and for the same not merited of any man
but freely of thy mere mercy given, we render unto the according to our most
bounden dueti most herty praises and entiere thanks. In consideracyon whereof
the children of Israel being in miserable captivity, Exodus. ii.
lamentably lamenting before the their to much sorrowful state by heartye
prayers, after that thou had delivered them from that land of seruitud, brast
out into exceading great praises, glorifyinge thy most holy and blessed name,
for their sweet and confortable delyueraunce. Exodu. xv.
The citizens of Bethu^a likewise being in great dystres called upon thy
glorious name, Iudit. iiii. and.xvi.
and thou most mercifullye deliueredst them, and they again with merry voices,
and more joyful heart (...) song unto the most hearty thanks* In like manner
thou didist deliue^ Joseph, Danyell Peter, Gene xli. Dani, vi. and.xiiii.
Acts. iii.
and many other thy servant from their sorrows and calamities: Oh, who is
able to expres with how ready and glad minds they magnified the and thy holy
name? We therefore sinful wretches excyted and stirred up with the godly
examples of these thy servants, knowi^g how greatly thou delightest in the
sacryfyc^ of praise, Psalm. l. Psalm. ^xvi. Hebru. xiii.
confessing also (such is our beggary) that we have none other thing worthy
to offer unto thy divine majesty, are at this present gathered together to
celebrate thy great mercyes, t^ magnify thy blessed name, and (...) render unto
the most humble ble thanks and immortal praises, that it has pleased the of
thine exceeding goodness the rather at the contempl^cion of our prayers, to
show thy favorable mercy in the deliverance of thy servant and our dear
brother. N. unto our singular joy, and great comfort. For this thy benefit,
most beneficial father, we so hertely thancke the, as heart can thyncke, most
entirely beseching the that thou will give us al grace, even so many as love
thy blessed word* never to be vnmyndefull of this thy benefyte, nor to commit
any thing hereafter y^ should offend thy fatherly goodness, or provoke thy
wrath against us, John. v.
least through our disobedyence we after this, feel more bitter tokens of
thy heaui displeasure, then hitherto we have done, but in all our enterprises
so too behave our selves according to thy blessed will, that thou may
delyghte in us as a father in his children, and vouchesafe to bless us with
all spiritual blessing, to enryche us with the knowledge of thy heavenly
word, i. Cor. i.
and to work in us a life conformable to the same, that other saying our
Godly manners, and christian conuersacyon, may be encouraged to embrace thy
blessed word, to magnyfye thy holy name, and in all points to frame their
life according to y^ rule of thy holy commandments, through the inspiracio^
of thy blessed spirit to whom with the, and thy dearelye beloved son Jesus
Christ be all honor, praise and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

A generalle prayer that all Men may walk in their vo^acion and calling.
Forasmuch, O heavenly father, as both thy honor and dishonor after a
certain manner depends in this world, Math. v.
either of our godly or wicked life (if we live well, thy very aduersasaries
shall be compelled to gloryfye the, but if our^ life be ungodly, Esaias. iii.
Ezec. xxxvi. Rom^. ii.
so shall you be dishonored among the wicked and evil spoken of through our
sinful living) and because we should not walk inordinatlye and so provoke the
enemies of thy truth to rail on the, and to blas^heme thy holy name, thou
have appointed in thy blessed law certain honest and godly states and d^grees,
wherein thy people should live, and haste streyghtelye commanded that so
many as profess the and thy holy word, should continue in the same, i.
Cor. vi. Ephe. iiii.
eueri one according to his vocacion and calling, and by no means lead a
dis^olute life after the manner of the heathen, which know not God, that by well
doing^ the professors of thy holy religion may not only stop the mouths of
folish, ^
and ignorant people but also provoke them to glorify ye, our Lord in the day
of visitacion: we knowing our infirmiti and weakness, which is so great and
unable to be remedied of our natural stre^gthes and frewill, ii. Cori. iii.
that we are not able to think a good thought, Psalm. ^xix
much less to fulfill thy commandments which thou haste straightlye
commanded to be kept and wyshing y^ glory of thy most glorious name and the
accomplishme^t of thy heavenly will most humbly and from the very heart beseech
the for Jesus Christ's sake to endue us, with thy holy spirit, which may
fulfill that lacks in us, make us new creatures, trade us in ye paths of
thy holy law, and give us grace to walk according to our vocacion in thy
fear, and in the obedience of thy godly will, that we attempt nothing that in
any point may hi^der thy glory, obscure thy honor, deface thy name and cause
y^ to be evil spoken of among the ungodly. And that this may come to pass,
grant O most merciful father that every one of us eue^ from the higheste to
the lowest, may unfeignedly answer to our calli^g, and train our life
according to thy blessed will, unto the glory of thy name* that whatsoever we
do in word, Collos. iii.

and take the oversight of the^, not as though they were compelled, but

that they may lay aside al tyranny and hautines of mind* and walk with all
gentel softnes and tender compassion toward the sheep of Christ committed to
their cure and charge. Let them be as most louinge fathers to Christ's
flock, and if any of the sheep chance to run astrai and to go out of the wai
let them not therefore vnge^tly entreat them, but as it is the office of a good

Let them remember the history of y^ lost sheep, and consider how te^derly the

For the servant of the Lord may not fight, but be peaceable and gentel

Let them cast away ungodly old wiuish fables, teachinge thy heavenly word

who planteth a vineyarde and eats not of the fruit? who fedeth a ^^ocke, and
eats not of the milk. If ye preachers sow unto their parishners spiritual

Thy ordynance is, o lord, that they which preach the gospel should live of ye

and not be bitter, Ephe. vi. Colos. iii. i. Peter. ii.
churlish or unkind unto them but give honor unto them, as unto the weker

and so behave them selfs as becomes womenne of an honest and godly
conuersacyon. Give them grace to array them selfs in comelye apparel, with
shamefastenesse and discrete behaueour, not with broided here, or gold, or
perle, or costlye arai* but with such as it becomes women that profes

the Lord and not me^ and therefore they may be sure, that whatsoever good a man
does, he shall receive it again of the Lord whether he be bo^d or fre. Further
more grant, Elders. Titus. ii.
O most mercyful father, that the elder men may be sober, honest, discrete,
sound in faith, in love, and in pacyence.

The elder women likewise grant that they be in such raymente as becomes
holiness, not false accusers, not given to much drynckyng, but teachers of
honest things, to make the young women sobre minded, to love their husbands to
love their children, to be discrete, chaste, housewifely, good and obediente
unto their own husbands that the word of God be not evil spoken of. Yongemen.
Grant also, that the young men be sobre minded and of honest conuersacyon.
To conclude grant that every one that profess thy glorious name, may so
live and behave him self both in thought, word and deed, that nothing may
proceed and come from them that should offend thy deuyne and most excellent
Majesty. Grant also (O most gentle and tender father) that our light may so
shine before men, that they seeing our good works, Math. v.
may gloryfye the our heavenly father, with thy well-beloved son Jesus Christ
our savior, and the holy ghost that most sweet comfortour, to whom be al
honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

A prayer for our enemies.
THe poiso^ful corrupcio^ of our nature, which we have sucked out of our first
parents Adam and Eve, works so strongly in us, O Lord and so myghtely
strives against the mocyons of thy holy spirit, Galathi. v. Roma. vii.
that we can not do that we would, nor accomplysh that y^ requirest of us. Thou
have commanded us to love, not only our friends, but also our very enemies to
forgive them y^ offend us to bless the^ that curse us, Math v. Luke. vi.
to do good to them that hate us, to prai for them that do us wrong and
persecute us, if our enemy honger to feed him* if he thyrste, Pro. xxv. Roma.
xii.
to give him drink, but our corrupt nature, Exodu. xxi. Math. v.
which ever strives against thy blessed will, seeks al means possible to be
reue^ged, to requite toothe for toothe, and eye for eye, to render evil for
evil, when ve^gaunce is thine, Deu. xxxii. Hebru. x. Roma. xii.
and thou will reward and by this means we grievously offend the and break
the order of charity, and the bond of peace, which seeks not to be reue^ged,
i. Cor. xiii. Colloss. iii,
but to forgive one another, even as Christ forgave us. It may p^ese the
therefore (O most merciful Lord) of thy bountyful goodness to forgive our
enemies, and not to lay to their charge those things, that they have unjustly
committed against us, and so to sle in us our old corrupt and cankard nature,
by taking away from us our stonye heart, and by geuynge us a fleshye heart,
E^^chi. xi. an^.xxxvi.
that we through the opperacyon of thy holy spirit may be content according
to thy blessed will and commandment, Mathe vi. and.xviii. Mark. xi. uke. vi.
Luke xxiii. Acte^. vii.
and after the example of thy son Jesus Christ our Lord, and of that blessed
martyr. S. Stephan, freely, and even from the very heart to forgive our enemies,
to speak well of them, to love them, and to do for the^ what so ever lies in
our power, and by this means vnfainedli show our selfs to be thy sons,
Mathe. ^.
which causest ye sun to arise on the evil, and on ye good, and sendest the
rain on the rightous and on the vnrightous, geui^g us example, that we, if we
will be thy true sons, should do likewise and show our selfs beneficial, not
only to the good and godly, but also to the wicked and ungodly, yt by this
means we may allure even the very adversaries of thy truth to speak well of
the professors of thy blessed name, and to glorify the our heavenly father,
which fashionest us according to thy manners through the mighty workinge of thy
holy spirit, to who^ with the, and thy only begotten son, be al glory and
honor AMEN.

A prayer for the adversaries of gods truth and that al men may come to the
true knowledge of gods blessed word.
IT is truly said of thine holy Apostle. O most merciful savior, that the
natural manne perceyueth not the things that parteyne unto the spirit of
God. i Corin* ii.
For they are but folishenes unto him, neither can he perceive them, because
they are spiritually examined. Thus to be true in the most part of men,
specially in the wise and prudent of this world (from whom the heavenly father
is wont too hyde his heavenly mysteries, Mathe. xi. Luke. x. i. Corin. i.
and to show them to the humble, and lowely) daily experience teaches us. For
while the wise worldlinges seek praise one of another, John. v, xii
they can not love the glory of god. While they cleue to their own fleshelye
wisdom they ca^ not abide the wisdom of God, which is counted folishnes in
their sight. While they go about to mayntain old crooked costumes,
supersticious ceremonis the trifling traditions of me^, they cannot away with
the light of thine heavenly truth. While they magnify them selfs, shame to be
taught, and by no menes will confess their ignorance, and error but persuade
the^ selfs, that they are in the truth, John. viii.
when in deed they are under the father of lies, and that they walk in the
light, when they are most of all wrapped about, yea and ouerwhealmed with the
mystye clouds of men's inuencyons, while also they abhor to hear the prechers
of thy word, and judge whatsoever they speak, new, erroneous and falls doctrine,
it comes to pas y^ they hate, persecute, banysh and co^dempne both thy blessed
word and all the favorers thereof* thynckyng the^ selfs to do the high service,
John. xv.
when they ^lea such as unfeignedly profess thy Gospel. And forasmuch as this
has conceived against thy holy word, and this cruelty against thy servants
comes from the wise of this world, the simple and ignorant people also for
lack of knowledge yeldeth them selfs unto the fancys of the wily worldlings and
the dreams of the bellyed Hypocrites, approving what they approve, condemning
what they condemn, and beleuynge what they believe. By this means is it come
to pass, that ye adversaries of thy blessed word are wonderful mani in number,
and very few are they which syncerelye, purelye, and eue^ with the heart
embrace and follow thy heavenly doctrine. No marvel: Luke. x^.
For little is thy flock. O Lord, to who^ it has pleased thy father to give
the kingdom of heaven, and although many be made, yet few shall be saved. For
many are called, but few are chosen, iiii. Es. vi. Mathe. xx.
so that ye true lovers of thy word are few but the enemies thereof are many But
O Lord this comfort us well, that although the aduersarys of thy truth be
innumerable, and albeit ye powers of this world stand up and come together
hurlye burly never so much against the Lord and his anointed, Psalm. ii.
and by no means will submit them selfs to the yocke of thy blessed law, but
seek all means possible to break it, and to cast it away from them, yet
shall they not prevail, their imaginacions their counsels and devises shall
come to naught. Prove. xxi.
For there is no wisdom* no forecast no counsel that can prevail against the
Lord. Thou that dwell in heaven, Psalm. ii.
mockeste their vayn entreprises, and laughest both them and all their most
subtyle devises to scorn. Math. xvi.
For thou art that rock, against whom the gates of hell shall not prevail.
Math. xxi.
Thou art that stonne, upon whom whosoever falls, he shall be crushed in
peaces, but upon whom so ever it falls, it shall grynd him all to poulder.
Thou art that prycke, against whom it is hard to spurn. Acts. ix. Apoc. v.
Thou art that most vyctoryous, and tryumphaunte Lion of the tribe of Judah,
against whom no flesh can prevail. Thou art that Lord, which bryngest to
naught the councels of the ungodly, and reprouest the thoughts of the people,
Psa. xxxiii.
yea thou make of no force all the counsels, devises and imaginacions of
Princes, establishing thine own counsel, Esaias. xlvi.
and making the thoughts of thine own heart to abide certain and sure for ever
and ever. And as thou art a Lord of most strong puisaunce, so is thy blessed
word of most mighty force. For it is a twybelle that cleaves the hard
stonnye rock a sunder. Iere. xxiii.
It is a consumynge fire devouring al ye adversaries thereof. Seeing the^ that as
the devises of wise worldlinges are wicked: so are they vain and of no force,
and shall surely be brought to naught at the time of the to fore appoyncted
(for every plant that thy heavenly father has not planted, Math. xv.
shall be plucked up by the roots) it may please the, which made Saul of a
wolf, Acts. ix.
a lamb, of a persecutoure a preacher, of a tyraunte an Apostle to bring these
aduersaris of thy truth unto the knoweledge of their error, that they may
repent, believe and amend, O Lord they are thy creatures, and thou haste no
pleasure in the death of a sinner but rather that he should turn and live,
Ezech. xvii Ezech. xi.
have merci on them* suffer them not to perish, make them of the vessels of
wrath, the vessels of merci, of the enemis of thy truth, lovers and embraces
of thy truth. Take away from the^ their hard and stony heart, and give them
a fteshye, soft, and gentle heart. Replenysh them with thy holy spirit, and
with the graces thereof, that as they are thy creatures with us, so they may
be saved with us. For we are taught that thou hateste none of al those things
that thou have made, and that thou dissemblest the sins of men for
repentance sake, Sapi. xi.
and art ready to have mercy on all men, that repent, believe, and amend.
John. vi.
Again, seeing ye nomanne can come unto the except thy father draws him, we
most heartelye beseech the, i. Timo. ii. i. John. ii.
which alone art our only medyatour and advocate, to pray unto thy
heavenly father, that he may have mercy upon the ennemies of thy word,
turn away his wrath from them, lyghten his loving countenance upon them,
Psa. lxvii.
give the^ a good spirit, and make them thy true and unfeigned dysciples,
Grant also (O sweet Sauyoure) which willeste all men to be saved, i. Timo. ii,
and to come to the knoledge of the truth, that all such as walk in
ignorance, blyndnes and error for lack of doctrine may have faithful
Preachers sent unto them, which may instruct them with thy heavenly word,
bring them out of darckenes into light, deliver them from the bondage of man's
tradicions and place them in the sweet lybertye of the spirit. So shall it come
to pass, that they which now are not thy people, shall be thy people and they
which now abhor and deface the glory of thy word, shall be the valeaunte
promoutours and defenders of the same and all such as heretofore have walked
through ignorance in all kind of supersticion and ungodliness, shall from
hencefourthe walk in the glorious light of thy Gospel, praise the, and
magnyfye the, obey the, and serve the in holiness and righteousness all the
days of their life, Luke. i.
unto the glory of thy blessed name. Amen.

A prayer for an uniform and perfect agremente in matters of Christen religion.
IN thy last and most sweet sermon, which thou made a little before thy
passion (o Christ thou son of the living God) thou gaueste thy peace unto
thy disciples, John. xiiiii
and willedst them diligently to keep and maintain the same among them unto the
and. This peace is the quietness of conscience, the reast of the mind, and the
perfect consent and whole agreement among the faithful in matters of thy holy
religion. In the prayer also made unto thy heavenly father thou desire, John.
xv^.
that as thou and thy father ar one, so thy disciples may be one, that is to
sai knytte together in one mind, in one iudgmente, in one meaning concerning
matters of Christen faith, i. Co^^. ^.
that they may all speak one thing, preach and wryt one thing, and by no
means dissent one from another. This peace, this vnyty, this perfect consent
in faith and religion is almost banyshed from among us in these our days,
Ierem xvi.
while every manne labors to establysh the inuencyons and dreams of his
own heart, while every man sweateth to imagine a new kind of religion and to
maintain the same, while every man seeks to worship the, not after the rule
of thy blessed word, but after his own fleshlye fansy and idle imaginacyon.
Thy holy Apostle, O Lord, could not abide, that there should be sects among
the Corinthyans, nor that one should hold of Apollo, i. Cori. iii.
another of Paul, the third of Cephas, but that they only should embrace the,
which alone by thy blessed passion broughtest unto them everlasting life,
forasmuch as thou and none other were crucified for them. If yt thy blessed
Apostle had lived in this our time, oh Lord how heuelye would he have taken
the sects that are now among the children of men, spronge out of hell and
thrust in by Satan, yea and that is most to be lamented, among them that
profess thy holy name. Insteade of Apollo, Paul, and Cephas, we have Benette,
Barnarde, Fraunces, Augustine, Sectary^^.
Anthonye, Dominycke, Rufus, Honofrius, Jacob, Joseph, Gylbert, Gregorye,
Brygyde, Clare, Helene, Sophye, Pope, Cardynall. etc. besides the dysordered

Hieronimites, the Tertiaris, the servants of sayncte Mary, the Lazarytes, the
Magdalenytes, the Whylhelmites, the Ambrosians, the Specularis, the

Heretics, Scismatikes, Anabaptists, Sacramentaries Libertines, and such other
dongehylles of Satan, which to much wretchedly have divided, rent and torn in
pieces the quiet unity and frendelye concord of thy holy religion, while they
have imagined and taken upon them new sects, and new orders, and by thee
tryfelinge obseruances of them, seek iustificacion, remission of sins, and
everlasting life, forsaking the, which art the fountain of lively water, and
digginge them myrye and durtye puddles that are able to hold no water. Ieremye.

O Lord, as this deuysion norisheth continual discord and enmity a mo^g the
professors of thy name: so do they that unfeignedly cleue to thy blessed word,
sorowfully lament, that thy glory, thy truth, thy word, thy passion, thy
blood, thy death, is through these idolatrous imaginacions defaced, obscured,
and almoost utterly quenched, in so much that if thou had not reserved unto
the a remnaunte, iii. re^. xii. Roma. xi. Romay. ix. Esaye. i.
which have not bowed their knees to Baal, we al had been as Sodom, and might
justly have been lykened to Gomorre. O blessed Lord, let very pytye move the
to have compassion upon thy poor troubled flock. Let the zeal of thy glory
provoke the to tread under thy foot al these Sectaries, and Antichrists, that
thou alone may be known among all nations to be the only true and living
God. Ah most gentle savior, (...) Mat. ^xiii.
there is but one lord one faith one baptism, one God, one father* one
master, one body, one spirit^, one hope, one truth, one gospel* how unseemly
the^ is it for us yt profess this unity to be deuid^d in religion* one to be
of this order, another to be of yt, one to mainetayne this doctrine, another
the contrary. Destroy therefore, O lord, this work of Satan, even the bryngyng
in of these damnable sects, and diversities of opinions, and restore unto us
that most sweet and comfortable unity of thy holy and pure religion, that
as we profess one God one baptysme, Ex. xxxiiii. Esaye. lxii.
so we may maintain one truth, and one religion. Thou call thy self a
gelous God, and a Lord that will not give thy glory to another, suffer then
thy honor and glory, Psa. ^xiiii*
thy praise and worship no longer to be given unto creatures. Thou art that God
of peace which haste promised to tread Satan the sower of discord under our
fete shortelye. Roma. xvi*
Fulfill thy promise, O Lord, for it is time, seeing that not only the wily
Hipocrites, Mat. xiiii. Luk^. xi*
those p^inted sepulchers outwardli appearing beutifull, and full of holiness,
but inwardly full of dead bones, and of al filthiness, of ravening and
wickedness, of bribri and excess, take part against thy holy word,
maintaining false opinions against thy heavenly doctrine, but also many of the
temporal rulers and wise worldli^gs agree unto the^, defending with great violence
both the beastly hipocrites, and al their deuelish traditions, crooked
ceremonis, false religions, although manifestlye contrary to the truth of thy
blessed law. Notwythstandinge remember thy old mercyes, and for the glory of
thy name, be fauourablye unto them, give them grace to repent and to know the
truth, i. Timo. ii.
that they may escape out of the snares of the devil, and become the children
of liberty and everlasting salvation. Gather together al such as are
dispersed, and make of them with us one flock. Call home again them that are
run astray after strange gods, John. x.
that they may gloryfye the alone. Deliver thy people out of Egypt that land
of servitude and bondage, and bring the^ into the land that flows with milk
and honye. Let the babbling Babilonians keep thy servants no longer in
captivity but restore them home again unto that Jerusalem, where thy holy name
is called upon, thanked and praised, where thy heavenly doctrine is purelye
taught, where thy blessed sacraments are truly and faithfully ministered,
where the works of Christen charity are continually exercysed, that with one
mouth and one heart we may praise and glorify thy blessed name. Take away from
us all heresies, and diversities of opinions, and work in our hertes an
unfeigned concord in matters of religion, even such a concord as is in all points
agreeable to thy blessed word. Grant also most loving savior, that this
godly concord may remain continuallye in thy church. So shall it come to
pass, that al sects and heresies, al divisions and Sismes, being roted out
of thy holy congregation, and a perfect agreement established among us
according to thy blessed word, we shall from the very heart both knowledge the,
Ia^o^. i.
the worker thereof, which alone art ye author of al goodness, and also sing
continual praises to the our Lord God, which with God thy father and God the
holy ghost live and reignest true and everlasting God worlds without end.
Amen.

A prayer for the common peace and quietness of al Realms.
How necessary, O Lord peace and quietness is for the conversation of realms
and al public weals, the holy scripture declares in diverse places: the
psalmograph exhorts all the faithefull Israelites to pray for those things
that make unto the quietness of Jerusalem, Psalm. ^xxii.
that there may be peace, wealth and abu^daunce both in it and all the coasts
round about.

When the Jews for their syns and disobedience against thy divine majesty were
led away captive, by king Nabuchodonozor from Jerusalem unto Babylon, and there
compelled to live under ye ungodly, and vncircu^cy^ed gentiles, the prophet
Jeremy wrote an Epistle unto them, wherein among other things he exhorted them
to pray for the publyque weal of Babilo^, and for the Magi^trates thereof,
saying: Iere. xxi^.
Seek the peace of the city, wherein ye be prisoners, and pray for it unto
the Lord. For in the peace thereof, shall your peace be.

Thy servant Baruch also wrote a book unto thy people in their captivity,
Baruche. ^.
comma^ding them to pray for ye prosperiti of Nabuchodonozor king of Babilo^,
and for ye welfar of Baltaser his son, that their days may be upon earth as
the days of heaven. etc. Again thy holy Apostle warns, that above al
things prayers, supplicacions intercessions, ^. Tim. iii.
and giving of thanks be had for kings, and for all that are in authoriti,
that we may live a quiet and peaceable life with al godliness and honesty.
Hereof learn we, O most merciful savior, how necessary peace, quietness, and
concord is for all relms and common welths. For yt bering rule, thy glory is
sought, thy holy word is preached, the Magistrates are obeyed, thy prechers ar
reuere^ced, good letters florysh, charity rests in men's herts, good worcks
are exercised, every man lives according to his calling, virtue is auaunced,
vice is expelled, wealth and abundance of all things dwells among us,
battle with all the pestilences thereof is banished, a figure of that heavenly
Jerusalem is here found among the children of men, when contrariwyse if
battle or discord occupyeth kingdoms or cities, all goes to hauock, nothing
but cruel barbary and lyonlyke fearcenes bears rule. How blessed a thing
christian charity, godly peace, frindly quietness, and brotherly concord is in a
common weal: thy servant David king and prophet having in his own relme
experience there of, declares in this his Psalm. Behold, says de, Pt.
cxxxiii.
how good and joyful a thing it is, brethrene to dwell together in unity. It
is like a precious oyntement upon the head that ra^ down unto the berd even
unto Aarons beard, and went down unto the skyrts of his clothyng. Like the
dew of Hermo^, which fell upon the hill of Syon. For there you lord promised his
blessing and life for ever. Saying (o almighty and everlasting God) it is a
good plesa^t and ioiful thing, brethren to dwell together in unity, vouchsafe to
give unto al relmes, specially unto such as ye inhabitaunts whereof profes thy
holy name, this tresure and jewel this pleasure and joy yt they may live
together in unity quietness and concord o lord so many of us as believe in ye,
are brethren, and have one father, eue^ thy heavenly father, and by him we
have y^ also our brother, and by y^ we be his sons and heirs yea and fellow
heirs with the of eternal glory, ^om. viii.
grant therefore yt we al may be of one heart of one mind, seeing that nothing
garnisheth and becomes the name of brethren better the^ brotherli love, true
peace, fre^dly quietness, and amiable concord. This Christian unity and brotherly
concord must needs be an excellent tresure in a common weal, saying thy holy
Prophet compares it to a most preous ointment and to ye most plesau^t dew, ye
swet smells where of cannot be expressed. Lord give us this precious ointme^t of
mutual love whatsoever we attempt among yt us may have a sweet smellyng savor
both before the and all good men. Give us also yt the most plesaunt dew, eue^
ye dew of thy heue^lye grace, which may cause us through thy holy spirit to
flourish with the abundaunce of al good works, and provoke every one of us
quietlye and peaceably to do our own besines, and to live according to our
calling, ii. Tim. ii.
ye magistrate godly to govern, the subject humbly to obey, Romay. xi.
the preachers of thy word diligently to attend upon his office. ps^. cxxxiii.
So shall it come to pass, that we as brethren quietly dwelling together in
this unity and concord, shall have that thou haste promised, even thy
blessinge, that is in this world abu^daunce of all good things pertaining either
to the body or to the soul, and after our departure from this vale of misery
everlasting life. Lord let it so come to pass. Amen.

A prayer to be preserved from the plage and orher dyseases.
AH Lord, as thou haste set forth in thy holy scriptures plenty of
blessings to them that fear the, Leuit. xxvi. De. xxviii* Esaye. c. v.
xxiii.xxx xi. Ier. ix.xvi. and.xxix. Ezechi. vii.xiiii.xvii^.xxxiii.xxxviii.
and with al dilligent obedience and obediente dylygence walk in thy holy
statutes and ordynaunces, so likewise in the same haste thou set^orth
innumerable curses and plages to such as live with out all fear of the, and
transgres thy blessed commandments. Among other thy grievous punishments, you
have thretned ye ungodly to send the plage and such other mortal diseases
upon them, and so to root them out from the face of the earth, because of
their disobedyence and rebellyon against the their Lord God. ii. Re. xxiii i,
Par. xxi.
Examples hereof we have many in thy holy word. Ah good Lord, who can be fre
from these and such other thy plagues, Psa. cxxix.
if thou shouldeste dele with us according to our iniquites? We are al
synnefull. Roma. iii.
The best of us all are unprofitable servants, Luke. xvii.
so that we ca^ find nothing in ourselfs wherewith we may worthelye either
pacify thy wrath styrred up against us for our manifold wickedness, or turn
away from us those thy plages, which we most iustelye have deserved.
Notwythsta^ding there are, which supersticiously for the appeasyng of thy
anger, and for ye dipsatch of corporal puni^hmentes call upon dead creatures and
flee unto domme Idols, as though most present help were to be looked for of
them, when in deed they can do nothing at all unto our health, neither
concerning the bodi nor ye soul. With such Idolatours. O good Lord have we
nothing to do, although never so grievous sinners. For we are taught by thy
holy word, nether to trust in Roche nor in Apoline, neither in Agasse, nor in
Annes, nether in Erke^wald nor in Grimbald, nor yet in any other creature,
either in heaven or in earth, but in thy great mercyes set forth in the
precious blood of thy most dear son Jesus Christ, for whose sake alone, for
whose merytes and good deeds alone, you art well pleased with man, fauorest him,
and delighteste in him as a loving father in his dereli beloved son. O most
merciful God, we finding in our selfs a just deserte of al those thy plages,
which thou art wont to cast upon the children of men for their wyckednes (so
great and manifold is the number of our sins) and nothing at all, wherew^th
we may in any part be able to turn aw^y thy heavy dyspleasure from us, are
come at this present unto the throne of thy mercy, most humbly beseching
the in the name of Jesus Christ thy son and our alone Mediator and advocate
not to weyghe our sins, and wyckednesses* but to consider thy great mercyes
and loving promyses, and for Christ's sake to put away from us al such
plages, (...). iii. and* ^vii. Mark ^ii. Luke iii.i^ ii. Peter. ^
as we most iustelye have deserved and to preserve us in such state of
bodily health, that we may live and glorify thy blessed name. Ah Lord,
Psalm. xxx. Es xxxviii.
may dust give thanks unto the? or shall that declare thy faithfulness? The
grave praises not the, death does not magnifye the. They that go down into the
grave praise not thy truth, but the living, yea the the living knowledge
praise, and magnify the. Defend us therefore, O Lord, from the terrible
plagues of thy fearful dyspleasure, but above al things remove from us y^
dyseases of our mind, that we being whole in soul, may behold the with a
pure faith, and serve the with a clean heart. Give us also the health of our
body unto our last days, that we enioyinge the health both of body and
soul, through thy syngular benefit, may lead a quiet and healtheful life
unto thy honor and glory. Amen.

A prayer to preserve the fruits of the earth*
AT the beginning thou commaundest the earth. O Lord to bring forth grene
gras, herbs, Gene. i.
and trees with their seeds and fruits* that they might be meat to thy
creatures living on the earth both to manne and beast. After that deep and
great flood, wherein all living creaturs perished except Nohe and such as were
with him in the arck* Gene. vii. ii. Peter. ii.
not only herbs, seeds and fruits gave thou unto man for to eat, Genesis ix.
but also all other thy creatures that move or live on the earth, whether it
be fysh or foul, Acte^. ^. Titus. i. Rom xiiii. i. Corin. x. i. Tim. iiii.
so that al things are pure to them that are pure, nether can any thing be
common or unclean, that thou have made pure and clean. For all thy creatures, O
Lord god, are good and none of them are to be refused, if they be taken with
thanckes geuynge.

For they are sanctified by thy word and by prayer, and were ordained of the to
be received with thanks geuynge of the faithful, and of the^ that know the
truth. Seeing the^ that thou alone art the creatoure and maker of al things, and
have prepared herbs, seeds, fruits, fyshe, and flesh to be meat for manne,
seeing also that without thy blessi^g al these thy creatures prospere not, nor
yet come unto a fortunate end, but grow out of kind, wyther away, perysh,
dye and come to naught, we most humbly beseech the to bless us and all the
fruits of the earth with al other thy creatures which thou have made for man's
use and profit. i. Cori. iii.
And forasmuch as neither he that pla^teth, nor he that watreth is any thing,
but thou, O God, which geuest the increase, grant we pray the, psalm. lxvii.
that the earth may give forth her fruit prosperously and plenteously, that
we may enjoy the same in due and conueniente time, unto our great joy and
comfort. Let not the labors of our hands, which we have taken in thy name, and
according to thy word, be found vain and frustrate, but according to thy
promise bless our labors, and bring the^ unto a fortunate end. For we, O
Lord, Psalm. xcv.
feed not our selves, but we are the sheep of thy pasture, Thou feedest us.
Thou geuest meat to the hungry. Psa. cxlvi.
Thou prepareste manne his corn, and prouydeste for the earth. Thou watrest
her forrowes, Psalm. lxv.
thou breakest the hard clods thereof, thou makeste it soft with the drops
of rain, and blesseste the encrese of it. Thou crowneste the year with thy
bountifulness, and thy footesteps drop fatness.

Thou also make the dwelling of the wilderness fat, that they drop
wythall, and the little hills make thou pleasa^te on every side. Yea thou
make ye valleies to stand so thick with corn, that they laugh and sing.
Psalm. ciiii.
Thou causeste the wels to spring up among the valies, and the waters to run
among the hills, that all the beasts of the fylde may have drink, and
that the wild Asses, may quench their thryste. Thou waterest ye hyls from
above, the earth is filled with ye fruts of thy works. Thou bring forth
gras for the cattle, and grene herbs for ye service of me^. Thou bri^gest food
out of the earth, wine to make glad the heart of man, oil to make him a
chereful countenance, and bread to strength man's heart, O Lord, how
manifold are thy works, right wyselye have thou made them al, yea, the earth
is full of thy riches. It is thy blessing, Pla. cxiiii^
that our garners are full and plentous with al manner of store, that our sheep
bring forth thousands, and hundred thousands in our vyllages and fyeldes,
that our oxen be ^ustye and fat, that we have all things plenteouslye for
the sustentacyon of our bodies. Psalm^. v.
For when thou openest thy hand, thou fylleste every living creature with thy
blessing, but when thou hydest thy face, they are sorrowful mourn, and dye for
honger. Forasmuch then, O most merciful father, as we receive of the alone
all good things, Psalm. l^^.
vouchesafe we most hertely beseech the, to show us thy face, to lyghten thy
continuance upon us, to bless us, to make the earth frutful, and to preserve
the fruits of the same, that we* thy creatures receiving at thy merciful hand
al things necessary for this our nedy and beggerli life, may live and magnifi
thy blessed name, both in this world, and in the world to come, through Jesus
Christ thy son and our lord, Amen.

A prayer that we may have the fear of God before our eyes in all our doings.
O Almighty and everlasting God, Mala i.
thy holy word teaches us, that thou art not only a father, but also a
Lord, not only a forgeuer, but also a revenger, not only a savior, but
also a Judge. And as thou beeinge a father, a forgiuer a savior do pardon
and show mercy, so thou being a Lord a revenger, a Judge punysheste and
condempneste. Neither does thy holy scripture only set fourth unto us a
gospelle, which comfort us, quyckenethe us, shows us merry tidings,
forgiueth our sins quyeteth our conscience, and bri^geth unto us everlasting
life, but also a law, which reproves accuses, condemns us, ii. Cor. iii.
wounds and sleath our conscience, yea and throws us down headlonge into
the deep dongeon of hell. And as the Gospel lyfteth us up, and makes us
merry with the hope of remission and forgiveness of our si^nes: so does the law
pluck us down and almost drive us unto desperacyon, for fear of the plages
and everlasting punishementes, which thou haste prepared for them that
despise thy holy ordynances, so that we may not only love the as a father, a
forgeuer a savior, but also fere the as a Lord, a reue^ger a judge.
Forasmuch therefore (O most gentel sauyoure and most righteous judge) as
nothing does so myghtelye put away, sin, and makes us to walk in ye wai
of thy commandments, ^ccle. i.
as reuerentelye to fear the to stand in awe of thy judgment and heuye
displeasure, we most entirly pray the to give us that fear, which thou
requireste of us in thy holy scriptures, (...). xxxiiii.^^ii.cxxviii
and whereunto thou haste promised so many large and bou^teous benefits that
we may not only love the as a savior, honor the as a father, but also
reverence the as a Lord, fear the as a judge. O Lord all things are open unto
thy eyes, neither is any thing hid from the which seeste the very secrets
and most inward thoughts of our hearts, give us therefore grace that in all
our enterprises, Hebru. iiii. Ieri. xvii.
we ever set thy fear before our eyes, and so stand in awe of the and of thy
righteous judgments, that we attempt nothing whereby we should provoke thy
heavy displeasure against us, but so walk in thy fear and in thy holy
ordinances, that we may at all times love the as a savior, honor the as a
father, reverence y^ as a Lord, fear the as a judge. So shall it come to
pass: that we reuerentelye fearing the as the child does his father, shall
not only avoid all such euilles as might make the our heavy Lord and ferce
judge, but also embrace those virtues, which shall both euidentelie declare
our faithful love, true honor, unfeigned reverence, and humble fear toward
the, and also make the our loving father and most merciful savior through
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

A prayer for ffayth.
VUe are taught by thy holy Apostle (O most loving Romans xiiii.
savior) that what soever is not of faith, is sin, and that, it is
impossible to please the with out faith, (...). xi.
and therefore they that come unto the, must believe, that thou art God, yea and
such a God as is both able and also will abundauntelye reward all them, that
with true faieth seek the. Jeremy. v.
For thy eyes O Lord, look upon faith and thou do appear and shewthi
selfvnto them, Sapien. i.
that have faith in the, Ose. iii.
yea through fayeth thou being the king of glory art married to the souls of
the faithful, and make them partakers of thy divine nature through the
wonderful working of thy blessed spirit, Through faith so many as believe ar
justified, Roma. iii.iiii. and.v. Gal. ii.iii.iiii. and.v. Ephe. ii. Mark, xi.
made the sons and heirs of God, and have everlasting life. By faith we
obtein of god al good things, even whatsoever we axe i^ thy name. Sei^g y^
faith is so precious a jewel in the sight, yt without it nothing is acceptable
unto thy deuyne majesty, and we of our own nature can not have this most
synguler treasure except thou geuest it unto us from above, and do breath
it into our herts by thy holy spirit (for we of our selfs are blind,
ignorant, folysh, i. Corin. ^^.
and by no means can perceive the things yt perteine to the spirit of God) we
most hertely beseech the to take away from us al infideliti and unfaithfulness,
which we received of old Adam, and to plant in us true faith and undoubted
belefe yt we may be thorowli persuaded that thou art the son of the living
God, Math. xvi.
Ephe. v.
very God and very manne, our alone sweet smelling sacryfyce, our alone
Medyatour, i. Timo. ii.
advocate and intercessoure, our alone wisdom, righteousness, i. John. ii.
Hebru. vii. i. Corin. i.
sanctificacyon and redempcyon, by whom alone and for whose sake only thy
heavenly father is well pleased with us, our sins are remytted, grace and
everlasting life are freely given unto us. O Lord God, suffer us not to lene to
our own wisdom, nor to believe, as blind flesh fansyeth, nor to seek salvation
where supersticio^ dreameth, but let our faith only be grounded on thy word,
and give us grace truly to believe in the, with all our heart to put our trust
in thee, to look for all good things of thee, Prouer. iii.
to call upon thy blessed name in adversity, and with joyful voices and more
merye hertes to praise and magnify it in prosperity. Suffer us not to dout
neither of God thy heavenly father, nor of the god his son, nor of God the
holy ghost, but earnes^elye to believe, that you being three dys^yncte persons
in the de^^ye, are not withstanding one very God, besides whom there is no
God neither in heaven nor in earth. i. Cor. viii.
Grant also that we may assuredli believe whatsoever is contained in the holy
scriptures, and by no means suffer our selfs to be plucked from the verity
thereof, but maynely and steadfastly abide in the same ^ue^ unto death, rage
world, rore devil. And this faith (O sweet Jesus) encrese you daily in us more
and more, Luke. xvii.
that at ye last through thy goodness we may be made perfect and strong me^ in
thy holy religion, and show our selfs both before the and the world truly
faithful, by bringinge forth plenty of good worckes unto the glory and honor
of thy name, which with God the father and God the holy ghost lyueste and
reignest true God worlds without end. Amen.

A prayer for Charity*
THy holy Apostle writes (O most gentle savior) that the end of the
commandment is love, i. Timot. i.
that comes of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned.
For he that loves the his Lord God with all his heart, Deuteronomy. vi. Mat. xxiii.
^euit. ^i^. Romans xiii. Mark. xii. Luke. xx.
wtal his soul, with al his mind, wtal his strength, and his neighbor as
himself fulfilleth the whole law. For all ye law and the prophets require no
more of us but love, eue^ to love y^ our Lord God above al things. and our
neighbor as our self. Without this love all that we do seems it never so
much praise worthy in ye sight of men is abominable before y^. Yea as thy
blessed Apostle says: though I spoke with the tongues of men and angels, and
yet had no love, I were even as a soundynge bras, i. Cor. xiii.
or as a tynklyng cymbal.

And though I could prophecye and understand al secrets and al knowledge, yea
if I had al faith so that I could move mou^tains out of their places, and yet
had no love. I were nothing. And though I bestowed al mi goods to feed ye pore,
and though I gave my body even that I burned, and yet had no love: it
profits me nothing. For by love are we known to be thy dysciples, John. xiii.
even as the deuyls impes ar known by hatred and maliciousnes. And the love, O
lord, yt thou requirest of us is no worldli nor fleshly love (for if any man
loves ye world, i, John. ii.
ye love of the father is not in him. And whosoever will be a fre^d of the
world, Jacob. iiii.
is made ye ennemy of God) but godly, spiritual, sincere, true and pure love:
eue^ such love, as suffers long, is courteous, enuieth not, does not
frowardli, swells not, i. Cori. xiii
deals not disonestlye, seeks not her own, is not provoked to anger,
thi^keth not evil, reioyseth not in iniquiti* but reioiseth in the truth,
suffers al things, believes all things, endures all things. This godly
love, this Christian charytie, give thou unto us, o good Lord that we may
unfeignedly and with all our heart, love the our Lord God, which so dearlye
love us, that thou gave thy self for us an offering and a sacrifice of a
sweet savor to God. Ephev. v.
Take away from us the love of worldely things, which though they appear never
so plesaunt and beutiful, are not withstanding mere vanity, and give us grace
so to use this world as though we use it not. For the fas^o^ of this world
passes away. Make us also to abhor the filthy and beastlyke pleasures of the
stinckyng flesh, i. Cori. v^i.
and by no means to be enta^gled with the love of the^, the end whereof is
dyshonoure, shame, corrupcyo^, destruccio^, da^nacyon, and kyndle our herts so
feruentlye with thy love* that no thing may delyght and please us, but only
thou* and whatsoever may make unto thy glory, and is agreeable to thy blessed
commandment, so that thou only may be our love, our delyght our joy, our
myrthe, our solace, and whatsoever is without the, and estranged from thy
love, let it be counted of us more vain then vanity it self, and more fill
thye then the very do^ge, Grant also that from this our love toward the,
there may issue out a vehement and brenninge love to ward our neighburs, yea
toward our very enemies, that we may love them from the very heart, yea, even
as our selves, pray for them* give the^ good counsel, help them, defend them,
socour them, provide for their necessities, Luke. vi.
and deal with them in all things, as we wyshe to be dealte with all. O Lord
God, thou art love, and he that dwelleh in love, ^. I^on. iiii
dwells in the, and thou in him. Grant yt in this world we may so dwell
together through love, you in us by thy holy spirit, and we in the by faith that
after our departure from this vale of miseri, we may be placed with the in thy
heavenly mancion, and so continewe with the in glory for ever and ever. Amen,

A prayer for a godly life.
IT greatly greueth us (O merciful father and ever lasting God) that we
through the grievous and continual assaults of our ennemies are not able to pas
over our years of this world with such purytye of life, as we ought, and as
thou requirest of us. Uerely we are on every part so beseged and compass, sed
round about of our adversaries, that scarcely at any time we can be fre from
their pestiferous and deadly darts, nor yet have so much respyte as once to
breath toward true godliness. Oh most louinge Lord, thou art our father,
and we thy children, convenient therefore is it that we thy children represent
and openli declare in our conuersacyon the ma^ners of the our father. Thou art
good, gentel, loving, charitable, merciful, pacyente, long sufferyng, holy,
righteous, faithful. etc. It therefore becomes us thy children in our
living to practyse goodness, gentleness, love, charytye, mercy, pacyence
longesufferyng, holiness, ryghteousenes, fayeth. et ce.

Thou have given us an example that eue^ as thou have done, John. xiii.
so we like wise should do. If we say we dwell in the, we ought to walk, as thou
haste walcked. i. Ioh. iii.
For thou have called us* not to uncleanness, but unto holiness. i* These. iiii
Thou haste delivered us from thee power of our enemies, Luke. i.
that we being without fear, should serve the in holiness and righteousness
al ye days of our life. The blood of thy son Jesus Christ has cle^sed us
from al sin, not that we should continue in darcknes, i. John. i.
but rather walk in the light as thou art in the light. Thy loving kindness
has appeared unto al men, Titu. ii.
not that we should follow ungodliness, and worldly lusts but that we should
live soberly, righteouslye, and godly in this present world. Thou dyddest
chose us in Christ, Ephesi. i.
before the fou^dacions of the world were laid, that we should be holy and
without blame before ye through him. Ephe ii.
We are thy workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which thou
ordeynest before, that we should walk in them, For As much the^ as all the
benefits which y^ have bestowed upon us, are given us unto this end, that we
should walk worthy of thy kyndenes, represe^t thy manners in our conversation,
mortifi the flesh, and the lusts thereof, have nothing to do with satan, nor
the world, but lead a good life, garnished full of good works, and in all
points fashioned after ye rule of thy blessed word, we most hertely pray y^ to
indue us with thy holy spirit, Ezechie. xi. and.xxxvi.
which may take away our stonye heart, and give us a new fleshy, and soft heart,
Ephesians. iiii.
kyl that old man in us which is corrupt through deceyuable lusts, and fassion
in us ye new man, which is made after thy Image and likeness in righteousness
and true holiness Suffer us not to give over our selfs again unto our old lusts
and co^cupiscences, wherwt we were led when we knew not the nor thy so^ Christ, ^
but eue^ as thou which have called us art holy, so likewise grant that we
may be holy in all our conversation. O merciful God, not the herers of thy law
but ye fulfillers of it shall be justified before the. Romay. ii. Jacob. i.
Neither shall every one yt says unto the: Math. vii.
Lord lord: enter into ye kingdom of heaven, but they that do the will of thee
our father, Titu. i.
which art in heaven. To confess thee with our mouth, and to deny the with our
deeds, works rather our damnacion then salvation. For ye true knowledge of ye
consists not in talking, i. Cori. iiii.
but in working, not in favoring, but in following, not in loving, but in
living. Math. xxi.
To promise the by mouth, yt we will work in thy vineyard, and yet work nothing
at al, declare not us to be thy sons, but rather bastards* to brag of ye
justification of faith, and not to bring forth ye fruts thereof, to glory in ye
merits of thy son Christ, in his blud, death and passion, and not to live
worthy of his kindness, Romai, vi,
to profes thy holy gospel, and not to walk according to the doctrine thereof, to
be baptized in thy name and not to mortifi our members which are of ye earth nor
to walk in a new life to be per takers of thy divine mysteries, Ihon. x^.
and not to be made one spirit with the, what avails it? we are thy friends if we
do those thing that you co^ma^dest us. We are thy seruau^ts, Romai. vi.
if we be obediente to thy will. We are thy sons, if we honor and reverence
the according to thy word. We seek thy glory if we attempt nothing, whereof thou
should be dishonored. i. Peter. ii,
Leding alife conformable to thy blessed will we shall provoke the very enemies
or thy truth to praise the, but contrary wise, thou shall be evil spoken of.
Grant therefore we beseech the, that our life may answer to our profession,
Math. v.
and that the light of our good works may so shine be fore men, that they
seeing our godly conversation may glorify the our heavenly father. Amen.

A prayer against the temptacions of the devil, the world and the flesh.
ALbeit (O most mighty captain, most valiant warryour and most tryumphante
Lord Christ Jesus) thou by thy death have put down him, H^bru. ii. i. Cori.
xv. Osee. xiii.
that had Lordshippe over death, that is to says devil, that thou might
deliver the^, which through fere of death, were al their life time in danger of
bondage, and albeit thou haste spoiled rule and power, and made a show of them
openly, and have triumphed over them in thine own parson, and by this means
delivered us from the hands of our enemies, Colloss. ii. Ephesi. iii. Luke. i.
that we might serve the all the days of our life in such holiness and
righteousness, as are accept before the, yet the devil for the old malice,
which he has borne against man from his first creacio^ (for through envy
of the devil death entered into ye world) gothe forth still to rage against us,

A prayer for remission of sins.
IF we wretched sinners, O Lord God, had not loui^g promises of thy tender
mercy in the holy scriptures for the comfort of our weak conscyences and
sorrowful herts, we se none other reamedy, so great and infinite are our sins,
but that we must needs despair. But for as much as what soever things are
written, Roma. x^.
are written for our learning, that through patience and the comfort of
scriptures, we may have hope, our sis although never so mani and abominable do
not so much make us sad, as thy loving kindenes and tender mercyes make us
glad. Our syns, we confess, are innumerable, but thy mercies are also
infynyte. Ezec. xviii.
Thou art that most gentle Lord, which wylt not the death of a si^ner, Say^e.

red as scarlet, yet shall they be made whiter the^ snow. And though they were like

for thy own sake, eue^ for thy mercy and name sake you wilt be good unto us,

Psalm* cxlv.
For according to these thy louinge promises haste thou ever dealt with the
children of men, whenever they repented and turned unto the. When they
forsaked their sinful living and called upon thy holy name, you forgauest al
their si^nes and he alest al their infyrmytyes. Psalm. cxx^*
Thou sauedst their life from destruccio^ and crowned them with merci and loving
kindness. For thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy, long sufferi^g
and of great goodness. Thou will not always be chiding, neither will thou keep
thy anger for ever. Neither wylt thou deal with us after our sins, nor yet
reward us according to our wyckednes. For look how hye the heaven is in
co^paryso^ of the earth, so great is thy mercy toward them that fere the. Look
how wide the East is from the West, so far do thou set our sins from us.

clemency and goodness, be our syns and wickednesses never so many, but they
rather do encourage us boldly to come unto ye throne of thy grace, ^^bru. iiii.
that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. O most
gentle savior, thou art that most loving shepperd, which diligently
soughtest up the wandering sheep, louyngely laydest it upon thy shulders, and
tenderlye broughtest it home again. Luke. xv.
Seek us up which have so long run astraye, lay us upon thy merciful
shoulders, and bring us home again unto the company of thy faythefull. Thou
art that most mercyful Samaritan, Luke. x.

ca^mest unto him, made clean his wounds pouredst in wine and oil, bou^dedst
them up, laydst the sick Samarita^ upon thy beast, and caridst him into ye inn
and never leaftest him til he was perfectly whole. O most loving savior,
vouchsafe also with thy merciful eye to look upon our wretched state, which
without thy help must needs peryshe. Our wounds are deadly wounds, and
not able to be healed of any, either in heaven or in earth, but of the alone,
which art the true Physician and alone healest the^ that are contryte in heart.

Our hole head is syck, and the heart is very heavy. From the sole of ye foot

with any ointme^ except thou put to thy helpyng hand. Let it therefore
please the of thy great goodness to make clean our wounds, to pour in the wine

thou have made us perfectlye whole, and brought us into thy heavenly
kyngedome. Heal thou us, o Lord, and we shall be healed, (...). xvii.
save thou us, and we shall be saved. (...). ^v.
Thou art that most tender father, which receiuedst home again with
embracing arms that lost son, which had wasted all his goods with ryotous
living. So soon as he returned unto the, repented him of his dysorder,
confessed his sin and humbled himself in thy sight, thou had compassion
on him, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kyssed him. Thou commaundedst thy
servant also to bring forth that best garment and put it on thy son, and
to put a ryng on his hand, and shoes on his feet. Thou gave commandment
again to fetch a fat calfe and to kill it, and sayedst: let us eat and be
meri, for this mi son was dead, and is a live again, he was lost, and now is
found. Show this thy favor (O most gentle father) to us thy children also
which have ungodly bestowed the godly and virtuous gifts, which thou both
friendly, and liberally gave unto us. This our prodigal and licencious lyui^g
sore greueth us and we be hertely sorry yt we hau^ so grievously offended thy
fatherly goodness. Notwythstandynge acccordynge to thy old wont, we most
humbly beseech the, for thy names sake to have merci on us, Psalm. xxv.
to forgive us our sins, and to receive us again into thy favor. Take away
from us al our old begerly rags, and put on us ye new garment of innocency,
yt precius ri^g of faith, wherewith we are married unto ye, Ose. ii.
and those most godly shoes of the euangelike peace, that we may walk from
henceforthe in the ways of thy holy commaundeme^ts, Ephe. vi.
and do that, which is plesa^t in thy sight. Give us grace so unfeignedly to
repent and to amend our life, Luke. xv.
that the angels of heaven may rejoice at our conversion. Psalms. li.
And so wash us from our syns more and more, that at the last we may be
clean and appear beautyfull in thy heavenly fathers sight, through the our
only savior, which with the same thy father and the holy ghost, lyuest and
reignest one true and ever lasting God, worlds without end. Amen.

Thy law also is a perfect and undefiled law, it turns souls and gives

A thankesgeuing after the Sermon.
WE render unto the (o heavenly father) most hertye thanckes for this
spiritual and heavenly nourishment of thy blessed word, Ihon. vi.
wherewith our souls are not only well refreshed at this present, but also our

humbly beseech the to give us grace, not only to be hearers of thy word* Iac. i.
but doers also of the same, not only to love, but also to live thy Gospel,
not only to favor but also to follow thy godly doctrine, not only to profess
but also to practice thy blessed co^ma^demente, yt whatsoever we outwardly
hear and inwardely believe, we may show forth the same in our conversation and
living unto ye honor of thy holy name, the comfort of our christen brethren
and the health of our souls. Amen.

A prayer to be said before the receiuinge of the holy Communion.
THy love toward us (O most Gentell Sauyoure) is so great and vume asurable,
yt it ra^ne by no means be expressed by mouth, nor sufficyentlye conceived
in heart, For our love without any deserts on ourbehalfe, even freely and
willingli at thy heavenly fathers commandment you ca^mest down from the
glorious seat of thy divine majesty, ^sa^e vii. (...). i. Luke. i. John i.
(...) ^x. Math. ii.i.
tokest very flesh, and beca^^est perfect man of the substance of that pure
and undefiled virgin Mari through the operacion of the holy ghost, taughtest the
will of thy heavenly father, confirming ye same with wonderful miracles unto ye
great comfort of many which the^ lived, and unto the perfect establishment of
our faith which live at this present. After thou had trauayled in this world
certain years, the time to fore appointed from everlasting of thy heavenly
father drawing nie* that thou should give thy self an oblacyo^ and sweet
smellyng sacrifice to god the father for the sins of ye whole world, Ephe v.
even so many as repent, believe and amend, willing that so noble and worthy
benefit of our redemption should not be forgotten, nor fall out of remembrance,
Galath. vi.
which is the alone authore of our salvation, and the only comfort of weak
conscyences. When thou had ^ate^ the Pascal la^be with thy disciples
according to the appointeme^t of the law, thou tokest bread into thy hand,
gave thancks to thy heavenly father, Mat. xxvi. Mat. xiiii.
brakest it, and delyuerest it to thy disciples, saying. Take ye, eat ye, this
is mi body, which is betrayed for you. Do this in the remembrance of me. Luke.
xxii. i. Cor. xi
Because the singular and inestimable benefyte of our redempcyon, brought to
pass by the one and only oblacion of thy blessed body, broken on the altar
of the cross, Hebru. ix.x.
should not be forgotten, thou brakest the bread in the sight of thy discyples,
and gave it unto the^, commaundynge them to eat it in the remembrance of the
breakyng of thy bodi, which the^ was betrayed by thy traitorous disciple Judas
that son of perdicyon, John. xvii.
and the day following was unfeignedly broken on the cross for our rau^some,
delyueraunce and salvation. Here did thou appoint the breaki^g of the bread
among the faithful gathered to gether for y^ purpose, a worthy and blessed
memorial of thy bodi breaking. And because the breakinge of thy body should be
ye better remembered, thou dyddest ennoble the bread with the name of thy body,
Note.
when notwithsta^di^g it was only ye figure, sign, token and memorial of thy
holy body. In like manner when supper was done thou tokest the cup into thy
hands, gave thanks to thy heavenly father, and delyuerest it to thy Discyples,
saying, drinck of this al ye. For this is mi blood of the new testament,
covenant or bargain, which shall be shed for many into the remission of sins*
This do as often as ye dri^cke it in the remembrance of me As by the breakyng
of thy blessed body our ransom is perfectlye paid: so by the sheding of thy
precious blood are al our sins even unto the vttermoste washed away. ^. John.
i.
Therefore as by ye breaking of the bread thou would the breakyng of thy
body and the benefits gotten by it, to be rem^^bred among the faithful, so to
the end that the sheddyng of thy blood, and the merytes thereof should not be
forgotten, thou gave the^ the cup of wine to drink, commaundyng them, that so
often as they or any of ye faithful gathered together for that purpose, do drink
of the cup, they should remember thy death and the sheding of thy precious blud,
as thy holy Apostle says: i. Cor. xi.
as often as ye shall eat this bread and drinck of the cup* ye shall show the lor^s
death till he come.
And asthou dyddest ennoble the bread with ye name of thy body* being but ye
figure of thy body, because the breking of thy body, should ye better be
remembered: so likewise, here do thou garnish and nobly set forth the wine,
naminge it thy blood, when notwythstandynge it only represents and preaches
unto us ye sheding of thy blood, because it should be the more depely graue^ and
the better retained in our minds. O most merciful redemer and gentel
savior, we are come together at this present to celebrate the memoryall of
thy blessed and glorious passion, and to eat and drink this bread and wine in
ye remembrance of thy blessed body breaking, and thy precious blood sheddyng,
most humbly and from ye very heart beseching the to give us grace, worthelye to
eat this bread and drink of this cup, least by the unworthy receiving of
them, ^. Cori. xi.
we be gylty of thy body and blood* and so eat and drink our own dampnacion.
And that we may come the more worthily unto this thy table, grant we most
entyrely pray the, that we may so earnestly be at defiaunce with al sins, and
so inwardly be ashamed, that we at any time have so grievously offended thy
divine majesty by attemptynge any thing, that is not agreeable to thy good
pleasure, that from he^sforth we may not only loathe, detest and abhor,
whatsoever is displeasaunt unto the, but also embrace and lay hand on that,
which is good and acceptable in thy sight. Math. v. Roma. xii.
Forgive us al our si^nes and give us grace even with our whole heart to love al
men, yea our very enemies, and not only to forgive al such as have offended
us, but also to be ready at all times to do for them what soever good or
pleasure we be able. And yt we may be the more welco^e unto the, and be found
mete and worthy gests to sit at this thy table, and to eat of these thy
blessed gifts that our soul may be well comforted, norished, fed and made
merry by ye worthy receiving of them, clothe us, we pray the, Math. xx^^
with yt weddyng garment, eue^ true and lively faith, wherewith our herts are
purified, wherewith we are married unto ye and made one flesh one blood with the,
Act^s, ^vi Osee. ii.
wherwyth also we are justified and counted righteous in thy sight, and grant
that through the same faith we ernestly set ye eyes of our mind on these thy
most sweet and loving promyses. Ephe v. Romans iii.v
My body shall be broken for you. Mat. xxvi. Man. ii^ii. Luke xxii. ^. Cori.
^^.
My blood shall be shed for you. And without any doubtyng look for remission
of all our sins at thy heavenly fathers hand, according to thy most
gentle promyses, yea and that not for our good deeds and merits, Titu. iii,
which in this behalf are none, but for ye worthynes of thy blessed passion,
for the dignity of thy precious blood, and for that only and alone sacrifice
of thy holy body. For that O Lord, is the salve, ye heals our souls. That is
the medecin, that comfort our weak and troubled consciences. John, vi,
That is the living bread: whosoever eats of ye bread shall never honger,
but live for ever. That is ye Jewel of joy, that makes our sorrowful hertes
merry. That is the mighty bulwark the strong defense, the sure fortres, ye
preserves and keeps us harmless against Satan, sin, death, hell,
desperacion, and all the infernal power. To come to the table, to be present at
the supper,
to here and se what is there don, yea and to receive ye holy mistiries of thy
body and blood there setforth unto us, profits us nothing at all* if we
faithfully believe not, that thy bodi was broken and thy blood shed for our
sins, and that by the alone oblacion thereof done once for all, our syns are
forgeuen us, Hebru. vii* ix.x.
thy heavenly father is reconciled unto us his wrath stored up through sin
against us, is pacified, quietness of conscience and everlasting life is given
us, but rather turns unto our da^pnacion, because we eat of this bread and
drinck of this cup unworthily: and shall with that Hipocrite, which presumed
to come unto the marriage, not having ye wedding garment, be bound hand and
foot, ^ath. xxii
and cast into utter darcknes, where weping and gnashi^g of teeth shall be.
Therefore we most humbly beseech the, to give us grace according to thy holy
Apostles council, diligently to prove, try and examine our selfs, whether such
repentance, such faith, such love, i. Cori. ^i.
such disposition toward al godliness be found in us, or not as thou do
require in them, which come worthily and with fruit unto thy table. And
forasmuch as it is thy gift to repent hertely, to believe truly, to love
unfeignedly, and to be disposed earnestly, to e^brace true godlynes, and to go
forward in ye same from vertueto virtue unto the end, grant, we most entirely
pray the, Math. iii.
we may so repent, that ye fruits of repentance may be found in us, so believe,
that we may knoledge y^ our alone savior, so love that al our affeccion may
be set on the alone, and so embrace true godlynes, that our h^le life may be a
clear Myrrour of virtue and goodness. So shall we through thy merci, be found
worthi gests of this thy table, Phil lp. ii.
and receive these holy mysteries unto ye salvation of our souls, yea so shall
we be well assured of the remission and forgeuenes of all our sins by the
breaking of thy blessed body and the sheding of thy precious blood our
consciences shall be quiet, our hertes shall be filled with all true and spiritual
joy, we shall triumph over Satan, sin, death, hell, and desperacyon, we
shall be partakers of all the fruits and merytes of thy blessed passion, and
be made one bo^ye with the, and fellow heirs of everlasting glory. O Lord
God, let it so come to pass for the honor of thy name. Amen.

A thankesgeuinge after the receiuynge of the Communion.
IE thanck the (O heavenly father) for the blessed passion and glorious death
of thy derelye beloved son our Lord and savior Jesus Christ, Ephe. ii.
^olloss. ii.
by who^ and by whose holy wou^des we faithfully believe and are assuredly
persuaded, yt thy wrath is not only pacified toward us, but that thou also
art now beco^e our most mercyful father, and haste frelye forgeuen us all
our sins, restored us to thy heavenly grace, and made us sons and heiers of
thine eternal glory. And because we should not dout of thy fatherly goodness
toward us set forth in the death of thy son, the same thy son Christ Jesus
our Lord has leafte unto us not only his holy word, Man. x^vi. Mat. xiiii.
Luke xxii. ^. Cor. xi.
but also a blessed memoryal of his death, and passion, set forth in the holy
bread and holy wine, which we at this present have received both for a
remembrance of ye brekyng of his blessed body, and the shedding of his most
precious blood, and also for the quietness of our conscience, and for the
assurance of the remission of our syns through faith. We beseech the (O heaue^li
father) that we be never vnmyndeful of this thy exceadinge great kindenes, nor
vnthanckful, for thy manyfold and unspeakable mercys declared unto us in the
glorious death of thy well-beloved son, but so work y^ in us through thy holy
spirit, that we maybe made worthy members of that body, whereof thy son
and our sauyoure Christ Jesus is the head, Ephesians. i.iiii. Colloss. i.
and that we may so faythfullye believe in the, and so feruentlye love one
another, always living in thy fear, and in the obedience of thy holy law and
blessed will, that we being fruteful in all godly and chryst^n works, may train
our life accordig to thy good pleasure in this transitory world, and after this
frail and short life obtain that true and immortal life, where thou with thy
derely beloved son our lord and savior Jesus Christ, and the holy ghost that
most sweet co^fortour, live and reignest one true God in all honor and glory
worlds without end. Amen.

A short prayer to be said at the receiuynge of the mysterye of Christ's
body in the holy Communion.
O Heavenly and blessed father, I render unto thee most hearty thanckes for all thy benefytes, which thou have showed unto me most wret^hed sinner, but
specially for that most sweet smelling sacrifyce, which thy only begotten
son offered unto ye on yt altar of the cross, Ephe. v.
by giui^g his most pure and undefiled body unto the death for the redemption
of mankind, Philip. ii*
in remembrance whereof according to thy well-beloved so^ns ordinance I now
receive this holy bread most entirely beseching, that I may both be partaker
of ye merits of thy dear sons bodi breki^g and also lead a life worthy of so
great a benefit, unto the glory of thy name. Amen.

A prayer to be said at the receiuynge of the misteryes of Christ's blood in
the holy Communion.
O Blessed and merciful father, thy love toward me sinful creature is so
exceadyng great and unspeakable, Roma. v.
that I can not but give unto the, most humble thanckes, Ephe* ii.
namely for the shedding of the most precious blood of thy dear son Jesus
Christ, by the virtue where of thy wrath styrred up against me wretched
sinner, is pacyfyed my raunso^e is paid, the law is fulfilled, my enemies are
overcome and put to flyghte. In remembrance of this so noble a victory and of
so great a benefit I am come unto this thy table, O merciful father to drink
of this cup, desiring the that as my outward man is comforted by the drynkekyng
of this wine: so likewise my inward man may be comforted and made strong by
true faith in the precious blood of thy most dearly son. O Lord and my
heauenli father, give me thy holy spirit, which may so rule and govern my
heart, yt I never be vnthanckful nor forgetful of this thine exceeding, great
kindenes; but so train my life according to thy blessed will, yt whatsoever*
I do speak, or think, may be unto the glory of thy blessed name and the
health of my soul* through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

A Prayer against Idolatry.
THou, O Lord art God alone, and besides the, Esaias. lxvi.
there is no God nether in heaven nor in earth. As for the gods of the heathen,
they are devils and the images, Malach. ii i. Cor. xviii
which the ignorant people worship as gods, by knelynge praying and offering
unto them are no gods, but stocks and stones, Ephe. iiii.
Idols and Mamets. They have mouths and speak not, i. Timo. ii.
eyes have they but theyse not They have ears, and hear not, Psalm. xl^i.
noses have they but they smell not. Psalm. c^^ii.
They have hands and handle not, fete have they, but they can not go, neither
can they speak through their ^hrotes. O how vain the^ are all they, that
put their trust in such mad fan^ies, as can do them no good? Psalm* ii.
Al health and salvation, al joy, and comfort come from the alone, Esaye xlv
ii. Cor. i. Jeremy. li. Psam. xlv* Ps. ^xlv. Iere, xvii*
O Lord, Thou art the god of al consolacion, and father of al mercyes. Thou
art the living fountain, from who^e alone ^loweth whatsoever good or godly
is. Thou art the refuge and succor of thy people. Thou hear thy servants,
whensoever they call on the. Who ever trusted in ye and was not helped. Blessed
are they which put their trust in the, and cursed are they that forsake the and
follow the Idols of their own heart. Psalm* cxiii* Esaye. lxv. Deu. xxviii
For as the faithful in thy presence shall find favor and merci: so shall al
Idolatours receive before the shame of face and confusion of conscience, yea
terrible judgment and euerla^ting dampnacion, Esaye, i, ^euit. ^xvi. I^remy.
ix.
besides those temporal punishments, which thou threatnest in thy holy law.
We beseech the therefore, O thou alone true and living god, to endue us with thy
holy spirit which may cleanse us from al blind erroures, al folysh fansyes,
I^o^. xvi. Ioh. xvii.
al vain supersticions, and from the whole lump of Idolatry, and lead us unto
thy godly truth, that we may know the to be the alone true, everlasting
and immortal God, believe in the, fear and love, call on thy blessed name, seek
thy honor and glory, and crave at thy merciful hand alone, alone, whatsoever
good thing we have need of, concerning the body or the soul, that we in th^s
world, glorifi^ng the our lord god, alone alone, according to thy blessed
word, may after this present life be glorified of the in thy heavenly
kingdom, where thou with thy dearelye beloved son and the holy ghost live and
reygnest one true and everlasting god forever and ever. Amen.

A prayer against Swearynge
O Almighty and everlasting God, Exodus xxi.
how greatly they that abuse thy holy name by vain and unlawful oaths shall be
plaged, Deute. i.
it is evident inoughe in the sacred scripturs. For thou thy self say, that
whosoever takes thy name in vain shall not escape un punished. ^a^ha. v.
And thy prophet saw flying in the air a great and large book, even twenty
cubyts in length and ten cubits in breadth, wherein were contained the cursses
and plages that are prepared for the^, which vainly or falsely swear by thy
holy name. It is written also that whosoever uses much to swear, shall be
filled with iniquity, and the plage, yt is the vengeance of thy wrath shall not
depart from his house. Ecle. xxxii.
Seeing that so many, yea and those terrible punishments, and most grievous
plages are threatened, prepared and setforth to all idle swearers and wicked
blasphemers of the and of thy blessed name, we most hertely pray the, so to
order our tunge, that it utter no ungodly nor file thy communication, that it
abuse not the nor thy name, nor any of thy cre^ tures either in heaven or in
earth, by unlawful and vain oaths, but that with all diligence we observe the
commandment of thy only begotten son, which straightly charge us, Math.
v.
that we swear not at al, Jacob, v.
nether by heaven for it is godds seat, nor yet by the earth, for it is his
footestole, nether by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king, neither
says he, shalt thou swear by thy head because thou can not make one white
here or black. But thy communication shall be yea, yea, nay nay. For whatsoever
is more the^ that comes of evil. Give us grace therefore (O most louinge
God) to avoid all ungodly and wicked oaths, to reverence thy holy name, to
ste unto it as a strong castle by herty prayer in adversity, and at al times
to praise, and magnifi it. Grant also that our communicacion be yea, yea, nay
nay that is, yea in heart, and yea in mouth, nay in heart, and nay in mouth,
that there be found no dissi^ulacio^ in us, but such symplicitie and truth in
our talk, and such si^cerity and pureness in all our conuersacio^ and living,
as becomes them that profes thy holy name, which alone is worthy all honor
and glory. Amen.

A prayer against Pride.
O Most loving and gentle savior the only begotten son of the eternal and
living god thou commaundest al them, Math. x^.
that will come unto the and be thy scolers to learn of the to be meke,
humble and lowly in heart, Math. ^.
to be pore in spirit, not to be puffed up with arrogance, pride, ambicion, and
vayn glory. For thou scatterest the^ that are proud in the Imaginacion of their
hearts. Luke. ^.
Thou put down the mighty from their seats and exaltest the^ of low
degree. Thou resistest the proud, i. Peter. ^
and geuest grace to the humble. Thou throwest down ye hauty minded, and
exaltest the meke spirited. Thou so greatly abborrest Pride, Eccle. x.
that thbou ryngest also the proud to naught and make the memoryall of them
to cease from out of the earth.

For pride is the orygynall of al sin, whosoever takes hold thereof, shall be
filled with cursings, (...). x.
and at the last it shall overthrow him. O Lord, what is to be found in us being
our own, that may make us to glory in our selfs and to be proud? (...)* iii.
As concerning our body what is it, but earth, ashes, dust and donge? ^
As for the beauty and favor of it. Oh how disceitful and vayn it is. (...).
x^xi.
And as for the strength thereof, how shortelye does a little fever make the
most mighty, the most weak. (...). iii.
Who tha^ will be proud of so vile a carcas and sack of donge? (...). ii.
(...)* v.
As touching our soul if it be regenerat by thy holy spirit what other thing
is it, the^ the bond slave of satan and sin. If any thing we have, that good
is (for all naughtines comes of our selves) it is thy gift. Os^. xiii.
If we have received it, why do we glory in our felfs, as though we had ^ot
received it? It may plese the therefore which art the Myrrour of true,
humility and geuer of al virtue, to grave in our herts the true knowledge of our
selfs that we may both willyngelye and unfeignedly confess, whatsoever goodness
we have, to be thy gift and so not to glory in our selfs, but to give unto
the most humble and herty thanks for all thy gifts, ever walking before ye
with all submissio^ and lowlines of mind, that thou may exalte us when the
time comes. Suffer us not to be hye minded, but to make our selfs equal to
the^ of ye lower sort, and give us that humiliti and lowlines of heart, that
mortifieth and kills in us al love of o ur selfs al pride and arroga^cy, that
our whole glory and reioising may only be in the our Lord and savior to who^
be al honor for evermore. Amen.

A prayer against whoredom.
(...). xlvii.
How greatly thou doste abhor whoredom, fornicacio^ and all uncleanness O Lord,
(...). xix.
ye drownyng of the whole world, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorre with
water, Exodus, xx.
fire and brimstone, Deute. v.
from heaven, and such other like plages mentioned in the holy scriptures* do
evidently declare and show. Deu. xxiii.
Thy commandment is that we should commit none adultry. Leuit. ^x.
And in the common* weal of the Israelits thou co^mau^dest, Deuteronomy. xxii
that there should neither be whormonger nor whore. If any such were found, ye
they should be stoned unto death. Prou^r. v.
For although the l^ppes of an harlotte are to the folyshe a droppynge honey
come, and her neck softer then oil: yet at ye last is she as bitter as
wormwod, and as sharp as a swearde. Her feet go down unto death, and her
steps haste them into hell, and he ye accompanies him self with an whore,
Prouer. ix.
shall go down unto hell but he that goes away from her, shall be saved. Prove.
x^x.
Yea he y^ mainteineth an whore, shall come unto beggary in this world, and
after this life shall have his part in the lake that burns with fire and
brymstone. O Lord, Apoca. xx i. Tess. iii^.
thou haste called us not unto uncleanness, but unto holiness and pureness of life,
i. Corin. vi
thou have made us one body and one spirit with the: how unseemly the^ is it to
take the members of Christ, Psalm. li.
and to make the^ the members of an harlot? We therefore most humbly beseech the
to make in us a clean heart to renew a right spirit within us, and to turn away
al voluptuousness from us. Ecle. xxiii.
Take from us the lusts of the body, let not the desires of uncleanness take hold
upon us, and give us not oouer into an unshamefast and obstinate mind.
Ephesi. v.
Let not fornicacio^, adultery, nor any kind of uncleanness be once named among
us. Let no filthy communicacio^n proceed out of your mouths, Ephe. iiii.
but that which is good to edify with all when need is, i. Cor. vi.
that it may have favor with the hearers. And for as much as nether
fornicatours, neither whoremongers, Ephesi. v.
nether weakli^gs, nether abusers of the^ selfs with the mankind, shall enherit
the kingdom of God: grant we hertely pray the that such as be unmarried, may
keep the^ selfs pure and undefiled after the example of that godly young man
Joseph and bring with the^ unto honorable wedlock both their bodies and minds
chaste and honest. Grant also yt the married men may beware and keep the^
selfs from all whoredom, Genesis xxxix.
and use the company of no woman besides their wife. Again, Tobi. iiii. Job.
^iii.
grant that al married women may practyse the manners of that virtuous woman
Susa^na, and nether for flattering nor manacing words at anytime consent unto
uncleanness, but so keep the bed undefiled, that their marriage may be honorable,
that God may bless the^ and their godly travels, and make them joyful
Mothers of many children. Finally grant (O most merciful father) yt we may so
avoid al uncleanness, yt we being pure both in body and soul may deserve to se
thy glorious face in thy heavenly ki^gdo^ through Jesus christ our lord. Ame^

A prayer against covetousness.
THy son and our Lord (O heavenly father, byddeth us take heed and beware of
covetousness, for no man's life, says he, stands in the aboundau^ce of
things which he posesseth. Thy holy Apostle also affirms covetousness to be
the rote of al euilles, i. Tim. vi.
and that they which study to be rich, fall into temptacion and snares, and
into many folyshe and noisome lusts, which drown men in temptacion and
destruccio^. And in a another place he calls covetousness the worshyppyng of
Idolles. Ephes^. v.
Thus, in every place of the holy scripture this most damnable sin of
covetousness is co^de^pned and forbidden* Notwithstanding. O lord through the
suttel working of the Devil, we se how this most vile monsture has prevailed,
and almost overcome the whole world and brought into his subieccyon not only
the wicked and unfaithful, but the^ also that profess thy blessed name and
holy religion. For from the first to the last, from the hiest to the lowest,
al give their mind to covetousness. Iere. vi. Phil. ii.
Al seek their own and not Jesus Christ's. They renounce the world in word but
in deed no man e^braceth it more desirousli. They by mouth profess covetousness
to be a line but in work they magnifi it, not only as a virtue, but also as
a God. In word they confess yt to be their Lord, Esay^. v.
but in deed they serve Ma^mo^. They make no end of ioyni^g house to house,
land to land, Lordshyp to Lordshyp, ferme to ferme, pastur to pasture. i.
Peter. v.
Another sort which ought to be an example to thy flock, cheyneth, coupleth,
lynck^the, and joins likewise dignyty to dignity, promocyon to promocion,
benefice to benefyce, prebend to prebende, deanery to deanery, office to office,
and office for a vauntage, unto the great dishonor of thy holy name, the
hyndrance of thy blessed Gospel and the confusion of their conscience, if they
had any. Esay^. lvi.
They be shamlesse dogs that have never inoughe nor be never fatysfyed.
Abacuc. ii.
They go forth daili more and more, to hepe up thick clay against them selfs.
Their covetousness knows nether end nor mesure, so yt if thou do not
shortly reform this outrageous desire of having, it is like to come to pass,
that Mammon shall be honored for a God, and thou utterly despised, few shall
possess the whole fruits ofthe earth, the other shall miserably sterue for
hunger. For there is no mercy on the earth, Os^. iiii.
as thy Prophet complayneth. All seek their own and not Jesus Christ's. Philip.
ii*
They be lovers of themselfs and haters of other. O good lord it may plese yt
therefore for thy mercyes sake, to redress these pestylences where with the
most part of the world at this present be infected. Open ye eyes of the
covetous worldlyngs, that they may clearly se how vile an Idol they serve,
Psalm. xxxix.
how uncertain possessions they gather together, not knowing to whom they shall
leave them. Take away from them inordinate and insatiable desire of having.
Psalm. cxix.
Incline their herts unto thy testimonis, and not unto covetousness. i. Peter.
ii.
Teach the^ that in this world they are but strangers and Pylgrimes, Hebr.
xiii.
and have here no abidig city, but seek for one to come, and that therefore
they ought to be content with that is sufficient. For nothing brought they
into this world, nether shall they carye any thing out of it. i. Tim^. vi.
Teach them not to put their trust in uncertain richesse, but in ye, the living
god: which geuest us al things abundantelye to enjoy them. Teach them to do
good and to be rich in good works, and ready to give and to distribute,
layinge up in store for them selfs a good fou^dacyon against the time to come,
yt they may obtain eternal life. Teach them to learn and practice this thy
commandment given by the prophet: break thy bread to the hungri, Esa. lviii.
and led into thy house the pore and harbourles. When you see a naked man,
cover him, and thou shall not despise thy flesh. Teach the^ to love their
neighbor as them selfs, Leui^^ xix. Math. xiii.
and to seek the commodite of their Christian brethren no less then their own.
Mark. xii.
Yea teach them ever to set before their eyes this commandment of thy holy
Apostle, let no man seek his own profyt, but the co^odite of other. Luke x.
Roma. ^iii.
In fine, grant that the conuersacio^ of so many as profess thy name, Jacob.
ii.
may be so far stranged from the most detestable sin of covetousness, that it
be not once named among them: Hebr. xiii.
again that they make the^ bags which wax not old, Ephe. v.
and gather treasure in heaven that fails not, Luke. xii.
where no thief comes nor moth corrupts that they being rich in good
works, Mathe. vi.
may obtain that blessed life, which you have promised to so mani as be loving
and merciful through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

A prayer against Glotonye and Drunkenness.
VUe are warned by thy dear son (O most merciful father) to take heed yt our
hearts be not overwhelmed with feasting and dronkennes. Luke. xix.
Eze. xxxvii.
For through festynge many have died, Ose. iiii.
and through dro^ke^ns innumerable have peryshed. If our first parents had
not obeyed their appetyte, Gene. ii.
they had not transgressed thy co^commaundement by eatinge the forbidden fruit,
nor have gotten so great an evil both to them selfs and to al their posterity.
If Lotte had not ben overcome with wine he had never so filthely committed
inceste with his own daughters. Genesis. ii.
Ex^ xxxii*
If the people of Israel had not given them selfs unto ba^ckettinge, i. Cor x.
they had not never so wyckedly fallen into Idolatry, nether had so mani
thousands of me^ ben slain. Math. xiii,
If king Herod had not ben overcome with banckettyng, he would not so sone have
consented to the death of the godly preacher S. John. Luke. xvi.
If that rich gloton had not been so greatly given to the pampring of his
belly, he would never have been so unmerciful to pore Lazarus. If the Sodomits
had not used bancketting and riotous living, Ezechi. xvi.
they had not peryshed with so horrible punyshments For thou* O lord can not
abide thy creatures to be abused. Gene. xix.
For besides everlasting dampnacion, which abides all glotones and
dronckerds, thou punishest these voluptuous Epicures and beastlye belli slaves
with corporal plages, with sickness and poverty, as thy servant Solomon
testifies. Where is woe, says he? Prou. xxiii.
where is sorrow? where is strife? where is brawling? where are wounds without a
cause. Where be red eyes? Even among those that be ever at the wine, and seek
out where the best is. Again he says, keep no company with wine bibbers and
riotous eaters of flesh, for such as be dronckerdes and ryotous perso^nes
shall come to pouerti. Another of thy servant also declares, that excess of
meats bri^geth sickness, and glotony comes at the last unto an unmeasurable
heat. Yea he says* that an insatiable eater slepeth unquietly, Eccle. xxxi.
and has ache and pain of the body. Seeing these foul and fylthy monstures of
gluttony and dro^kennes bring unto us the destruction both of body and soul,
we beseech the, O heauenli father, to give us grace, that from hensforth we may
be from these beastly vices as from most present pestile^ces, and use thy
good creatures soberly, temperatelye and tha^ckfully, Roma. xiii.
and by no means make provision for the flesh to fulfill ye lusts thereof, but
be sober and watch yt we fall not into ye snares of our gostly enemy the
Dyuel, which walks about like a roringe Lion seking whom he may devour and
labor for that meat, i. Peter. v.
which perysheth not but abides into everlasting life: John. x.vi.
that we living soberly, watching warely, prayinge continually, and loking
diligently for the coming of thy dearlye beloved son, Luke. xvii.
may be found ready whenever he comes and enter with him into the glory of
heaven for ever and ever. Amen. i. Te^so. vi.

A prayer against Idleness.
Immediately after thou had created man (O maker of heaven and earth) and
placed him in the garden of Eden, Gene. ii.
thou conmaundedst him to dress, and keep it, because he should not be idle.
For idleness is ye occasion of much evil. Eccl. xxxiii
In like manner after man had transgressed thy holy commandment, thou
expulsing him out of paradise for his disobedience, Gene. iii.
and sending him abroad into the face of the earth, commandedst him to eat his
bread in the sweet of his face, and in the labor of his hands, Psalm. cxix.
so that thy good pleasure is, that no man should be idle. This thy
commandment was diligentli observed of the godly auncyente fathers. ^ene*
iiii.
Adam tilled the earth. Abel was a shepparde. Iubal exercised Music. Tubalcain
was a worker in metal, and a grauer in brass and iron. Gene. ix.
Nohe planted a vyneyarde. Abraham, Lot, Isaac and Jacob were shepherdes and
plowemenne, G^ne. xiii. and.xxvi.xxix.xii. Exodu. iii. i. Re^. xvi. (...). i.
Joseph was a Magistrate. Moises, David, Amos with diverse, other, kept sheep
before they were called unto office. Thy dearly beloved son, before you
appoyntedst him to be a preacher of thy blessed will unto ye world was a
Carpenture, Mark. xiii
and so got his lyuinge. His Apostles were fysher me^. Math. iiii.
Blessed Paul labored with his own hands, and got both his own living and
others yt were with him. (...). xx.
Thabita is commended in the holy scripture, because she made garments, and
gave them to the pore people. So many, O Lord, as had any sparcke of
godliness or pretense of honesti in them, i. Tesso. ii.
even from the begi^ning unto this day ever abhorred idleness, ii. Tes. iii.
and practiced one thing or other, Acts. ix.
so yt they were never idle, but earnestly travailed eueri one according to
their vocacion. For as the bird is born to fly, so is man borne to labor. Yea
thy holy apostle has charged us in thy name, John v. i. Tes. iii.
that if any will not l^bour, he should not eat. He co^ma^deth also, yt we should
withdraw our selfs from eueri one yt walks inordinatly, and will not labor
for his own liui^g? And the wise man se^deth us unto ye Emmet as unto a mastres
and exa^plar of labor, Prove. vi.
and wills us to consider her property, that we may be wise which although
she has nether gide, techer nor head, yet provides she her meat in so^mer,
and gathers together her fode in harvest, we beseech y^ therefore O Lord, to
drive away from us, al idleness and sluggish behaueoure, and to give us grace yt
eueri one of us eue^ so many as profess thy blessed name, may be earnest in
following their vocacion, and delighte in godly trauails and virtuous exercises*
ye magistrate in rightously governing ye commonwealth, the spiritual minister
in truli preachi^g thy blessed word, the common people in diligently following
their occupatio^s, sciences and mistiries, yt none be found idle in the
christen public weal. So shall it come to pass, that all being vertuousli
occupiedaccordi^g to thy holy commandment, you shall delighte in us as a father
in his children, and se^d us the fruits of our labors, that is, abundance of
al temporal things in this present world, and after our departure
everlasting glory, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

A prayer against slaunderynge and backebytynge.
THe tongue (O Lord) is a member, which thou have given almost generally to al
living creatures, but speech haste thou researued only for man, yea and that
unto this end that he should set forth thy praise and glory, magnifi thy
blessed name, auance thy holy religion, be ever telling of thy wonderus works
and always speaking, that which may make unto thy glory* and unto the profyt of
our Christen brethren. The tongue rightli used, Prouer. x.
is the organ of the holy ghost. Prouer. xv.
An innocent and righteous tongue, is a noble treasure, a tree of life, Prove. xvi.
an honey comb, a refreshyng of the mi^d, and health of the bones. Prouer. xx.
A mouth of understanding is more worth the^ gold then many precious stones
and costlye Jewels. But this gift of speech, O blessed Lord is now a days
greatly abused both unto thy dyshonoure and the unquietness of thy people. For
where as thou by thy dearly beloved son gave a general commau^deme^t, yt we
should bles the^ that curse us, it is now come to pass, that they whom we
bles, Mathe. v. ^uke. vi.
curse us, whom we speak well of they backebyte us, whom we ^xhort, monish and
teach good things, they deface, slander and blaspheme us, whose wealth and
health we seek, they contrariwyse seek our destruccio^ O Lord, their mouth is
full of cursed speaking, (...)* i.
and their tongue paynteth forth deceyte. They sit and speak against their
brethren and slander even their very well willers. Their to^gimagineth
wickedness, and with lies it cutteth like a sharp rasour, They love to speak
al words that may do hurt With their tongue they bless ye, psalm. iii*
and with the same to^g they curse us, which are made after thy similitude,
image and lykenes, so that out of one mouth there proceeds curssyng and
blessing. Jacob. iii.
But with such blessings, O Lord, art not thou delighted. But what marvel is
it, O heavenly father, though bacbitynge and slaunderynge be used in these
our days? In what age has the slanderous and backebityng tongue ceased from
her slau^derynge and backbiti^g? Who of al thy well-beloved servants escaped fre
from her poysonfull and venomous darts? Was not thy hertye beloved servant
Dauyd that king and Prophet slaundered of that wicked and blasphemous

deadly poison. We beseech the therefore for thy mercyes sake (o most
merciful God) to deliver us from unrighteous lips and from deceitefull
tounges, Psa. xxxi^.

adversaries may be ashamed to slander and to speak evil of us. Grant also

A general prayer for the auoidinge of all kind of sin.
AH lord that most puisa^t god, we in baptism giving over our selfs unto the,
and unto thy holy religion, protested openly in the face of thy holy
congregation, to forsake Satan with all his pompes and worckes, to renounce the
world and all the vain pleasures thereof, to mortyfy the flesh and all the
lusts of it, Roma vi.
and from he^sforth to dye unto sin, to live unto righteousness, Gala. iii.
and to lead a new life. This our covenant and bargayne made with the, O Lord
god, we keep not, but to much wretchedly we break it and tra^sgres thy holy
commandment. In stead of our service due unto the we serve Satan. Leuing the
fulfyllyng of thy commandments we obey our own will. The world and the flesh
so rage and raignin us, that we can scarcely breath toward any godlynes. Titus.
i.
By mouth we profes the, but with our deds we denithe. We promise to work in
thy vyneyarde, but we loytour and work not. Mathe. xx^
In name we are Christians, but in deed we are satan's bondme^, the worlds
slaves and the fleshes most vile servants and drudges. Ah Lord, to much
wretched is our state, and except thou shortly helpest, we are like utterly
to perysh, so greatly have the ragyng floudes of al kind of sin brast in,
prevailed and almost overwhelmed us, o most gentle savior, we have a will such
as it is, Rom^^ vi^.
to do good, but we find no power no strength in our selfs to perform it. That
good thing, which we would, we do not, but ye evil do we, which we would not,
for we know yt in us yt is, Rome. vii.
in our flesh, dwells no god thing. No marvel. For we are by nature ye
children of wrath, Ephesia ii.
we are begotten, conceived and borne in si^. Our se^ces, Psalm. ii.
wits and devises ar evil, eue^ from our young age upward. Our heart is
unclean, Gene. viii.
wicked, froward, lewd, and unsearchable. We are not able to think a good thought
of our selfs, Prou. xxii.
we are unprofitable servants, Iere. xvii. ^i. Cor. iiii.
hipocrites, flesh, and al ye naught is, yea, we are the very bo^d slaves of

For every one ye commits sin, is the servant of syn. O most sweet sau^or*

Thou ca^mest down, from ye rightha^d of thy father into this vale of misery,
to save that which was lost. Save us therefore good lord which wander abroad

Deliver us therefore from his raging tirranye, and make us thy faithful and
obedyent servants. John. ii.
Suffer us not to love the world, nether the things that are in the world, seeing
that all that is in the world (as the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
the pride of life) is not of ye o father, but of ye world. And the world
vanishes away, and the lust thereof, but he that fulfilleth the will of god
abydeath for ever. Suffer us not to be overcome with the boylynge
concupisce^cis of the flesh, which ever lusts against the spirit, Romans viii.
and is not obedient to the law of god nether can be, but give us grace to
crucifye and to kill the flesh with the appetites and lusts thereof, Galath. v.
that we may live and walk in the spirit, and become new creatures. Let not
sin reign in our mortal bodies, that we should there unto obey in ye lusts of
it. Neither suffer thou us to give our members as instruments of
unrighteousness unto syn, Roma. vi.
but to give our selves unto God, as they that are a live from death, and to
give our members as instruments of ryghteousnes unto god. And as heretofore we
gave our members servant to uncleanness, and to iniquyti, from iniquiti to
iniquiti: so let us now from hensforth give our members seruau^ts unto
righteousness, that we may be sa^tyfyed. Kill in us the deds of the flesh which
are these: Gala. v.
aduoutrye, fornicacion, uncleanness, wa^tonnes Idolatrye, wytchcrafte, hatred,
varyaunce, ^ele, wrath, strife, sesedicion, sects, envying, murder
drunkenness, glotto^ny, and such like, and plant in us the fruits of the
spirit, love, joy, peace, long sufferinge, gentleness, goodness faythfulnes,
meekness, tempera^cye. Ephe. iiii.
As concerning the conuersacyon in times past, give us grace to lay away from
us that old man, which is corrupt through the deceiuable lusts, and to be
renewed in the spirit of our mynds, and to put on that new man, which after the
image of god is shapen in ryghteousnes and true holiness. Suffer us not to lie,
but speak every man truth unto his neighbor, for as much as we are members one
of another. Suffer us not so to be angry that we sin. Let not y^ sun go down
upon our wrath, neither let us give place unto the backbiter. Grant that he
which before has stolen may from henceforth steal no more, but rather labor
with his hands some good thing: that he may have to give unto hi^ that needs.
Let no fylthy co^munycacyon proceed out of our mouths, but that which is good
to edifye withal, when need is, that it may have favor with the hearers. Let
all bytternes, fearsnes, and wrath, roryng and cursed speking be put away from
us, with al maliciousness. Make us courteous one to another and merciful,
forgeuing one another, even as god for thy sake forgave us. Ephesi. v.
As for fornicacio^ and al uncleanness or couetusnes let it not be once named
among us, as it be comes saints nether filthi things neither folish talking,
nether jesting, which are not comely, but rather giving of thanks. Put upon us
tender mercy, kindness, humblenes of mind, mekenes long. sufferi^g, for bearing
one another and forgeuing one another. Collos. iii.
But above al these things, put upon us love which is the bond of perfeccion
and grant that the peace of god may ever more rule in our herts, and that we
be tha^kful for all thy benefits. Finalli whatsoever things are true whatsoever
things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure
whatsoever things pertayne to love, whatsoever things are of honest report,
if there be any virtuous thing, Pp^il. iiii.
if there be any laudable thing, grant that we may have those same in our mind,
and practice the^ in our conversation and living, that whatsoever we breath
thyncke, speak, or do, all things may be done, unto ye honor, glory and
praise of thy name, which lyueste and raygneste with God the father, and GOD
the holy ghost, the true, living and everlasting God, worlds without end.
Amen.

A prayer unto God in prosperity.

VUe are taught in thy holy word (O most merciful father) that every good

that we have nothing in this world pertayninge either unto the body or unto

thy gifts nor licenciouslye to abuse them, but always mekely to acknoweledge
the thalone geuer of them, continually to be thanckeful unto the for them, and
so to use the^ all the days of my life unto the glory of thy holy name and
the profyt of the Christen congregacyon, that when so ever I shall depart from
this vale of miserye, and come before the glorious throne of thy divine

iustlye deserved, and yet not withstanding I am perfectly persuaded, that it is
thy most gentle and louinge visitacion, Prouer. iii.
yea and an evident token not of thine anger and heavy displeasure, Hebru. xii.
Apoca. iii.
but of thy fatherly love and hearty good will toward me, i. Corin. xi.
while on this manner thou correctest me in this world, that I may not be
condemned with this wicked world. My sins I grant, O heavenly father,
have deserved a more grievous and bitter cross, which in deed have full often
deserved very hell, but thou consyderyng my frail and weke nature dealest not
with me after my deservings, but according unto thy greatst mercyes:
Uouchsafe therefore (o most loving savior) to give me thy holy spirit, which
may work in mi heart such thankful pacyence and pacyent tha^kefulnes, that
ever I grudge nor murmr against thy blessed will, Eccles^. ii.
but continuallye call on thy holy name with hartye prayers, and even from the
very botom of the heart praise and magnify the my heavenly father, Psalm^. i.
being well contented to suffer what so ever thy good pleasure shall be to lay
upon me, nothing doubting but that thou wylt here after mercifullye look upon
me, and restore unto me the fruic^on and enioyinge of thy former benefits,
that I seeing again good and prosperous days on the earth, may live and sing
unto thy godly Majesty contynuall praises and most hearty thanckes through
Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with the and the holy Ghost be all glory
and honor for ever and ever. Amen.

A thanksgeuyng unto God for sendynge his son into this world to die for our

After thee fall of the sinful angels, what an exceadynge great kyndenesse
was this, Job. iiii.
to make man after thy similitude, image and liknesse, ii. Peter. ii.
that he and his posteritye might furnyshe and occupy those places in thy
glorious kyngedome, Gene. ii.
which the proud and dysobedient angels lost for their proud dysobedye^ce
and disobedient pride. Not only to place man in earth, but also to provide
aforehande all things necessary for him yea to make hi^ Lord and ruler of al
things contained in the earth under y^, his Lord GOD? Psalm^. ^^.
O what a wonderful loving kyndenes was this Again to preserve, keep and
defend man, to watch continually upon him whether he wake or sleep, as the
delige^t and careful shepherd watches over his flock, that no evil chance to
man, and to dyrrecte his thoughts, counsels and deuyses unto the best, never
leauinge him, til thou haste brought him into thy heavenly kyngedome. O who is
able with tongue to express or with heart to thyncke this thy hertye good will
toward manne. These benefits (O most merciful father) are exceadynge great
tokens of thy dear love toward mankind, but the gift of thy only begotten
son Jesus Christ our Lord, Mathe. i. ii. Timo. ii Ephesi. ii*
whom thou gave unto us to be our sauyoure, our redemer, i. Cor. i.
our peacemaker, our wisdom, our santificacion, and our righteousness, is the
most excellent gift and most precius treasure? A child to be born for our

God ye father so derely to love ye world that he would give his only begotten

He was wounded for our offenses, and smitten for our wyckednes. The pain of
our punishment laiedst thou upon him, and with his stripes were we healed.
Through him, O lord, dyddest thou pardon all our sins. It was thy good pleasure
to smite him with infyrmity, Esaye. liii*
yt when he had made his soul an offering for sin, he might se long
lasting seed. For he is yt thy righteous servant, which with his wisdom does
justify and deliver the multitude, for he has born away our sins. In his name
and in none other under he aue^ does our salvation consist. A^t^s. iiii.
By him are we at peace with the our Lord God. Romay. v.
By him have we redempc^on through his blood, even remission of our sins.
Ephe. i.
By him are we delivered from the power of darken^s and translated into thy
heavenly kingdom. Collosso. i.
By him have thou reconciled all things unto thy self. By him haste thou set
at peace through the blood of his cross, both things in heaven and things on
earth. By him haste thou quickened us, and forgenen us al our trespasses. He
has put out the hand wryghtyng that was against us contained in the law
written. Ephe. ii.
Yea he heath taken that hand wryghtyng out of the way and has fastened it to
his cross and has spoiled rule and power and has made a show of them
openly, Collos. ^.
and has triumphed over them in his own parson. Gene. iii.
He is that seed of the woman, that tredeth down Satan's head. Gene.
He is that seed, in whom al nations of ye world shall be blessed. Esay^.
He is that Lord, which alone has trodden down the wynepresse, nether was
there any at all that helped him. Mathe. ^.
He is that savior, which saves his people from their sins, Mat* xvii.
He is that they well-beloved son, for whose sake you art well pleased with man
He is that bread of life, which came down from heaven. John. vi.
If any eat of yt bread he shall live for ever. He is that good shepherd,
which gave his life for his sheep. John. x.
He is ye resurrection and life. Who so believes on him, John. xi.
although he were dead, shall live, and every one that lives and believes in
him, shall never die. John. xvi.
He is that mighty Prince that has overcome the world. He is the perfect
fulfillinge of ye law to justify all that believe. Romay. x.
Gala. iii.
He has delivered us from the curse of the law, when he was made accursed
for us. He in his own person has purged our sins. Hebrews. ii.
He through death has put down him that had rule over death, that is to sai
the devil, and has made us free from the danger of bondage. He with one
offering of his blessed body has made perfect for ever them that are
sanctified. Hebru^s, x.
He now in the end of the world has app^ared once for all to put sin to
flyghte, by the offering up of him self. He has loved us, and washed us from
our syns in his own blood, Apoca. i.
and made us kings and priests unto the God his father. Inestimable ar the
tresurs and infinite are ye pleasures which we receive of the through this thy
son Jesus Christ our Lord and sauyoure. Romans viii.
And this thy well-beloved and only begotten son with al his, have thou given unto
us, so that booth he and all that he has is ours, and we may through thy
gift justly, challenge it to be our own. For this thy fatherly love and
unspeakable kyndenes in geuynge thy son unto the death for our sake, and for all thy other benefits, which we have receued at thy merciful hand through him,
we give the most herty thanks, desyryng the, that we never commit any thing
in thought, word, or deed, that may offend thy deuyne Majesty: but calling
to remembrance that we are not redeemed with corruptyble silver and gold from
our vain conversation, i. Peter. i.
but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb undefiled and without
spot, we may live worthi of this thy kidnes, and show our selfs obedyente
chyldr^n to the, our heavenly father, not fashyonynge our selfs any more
after this unto our old lusts of ignorancye, but as thou, which have called
us art holy, even so in like manner we may be holy in all our conuersacyon
and living unto the glory of thy blessed name. Amen.

A thankesgeuynge unto God, that he has brought us out of the darkness of
men's tradicions* into the glorious light of his holy gospel.
O Lord GOD and our heavenly father, Esaye. v.
thou by thy holy Prophet declareste that thy people were led captyue
because they had no knowledge nor understanding in thy blessed word. No
marvel, for as thy dearly beloved son sayethe, he that walks in ye
darcknes, Ihon. xii.
knows not whither he goes. Yea, Sapi. xiii.
vain ar al they in whom the knowledge of yt our lord god is not. John. xvii.
For this is everlasting life, even to know the to be the true God, and who^
thou have sent, Jesus Christ. Prou. xxix.
When y^ preaching of thy word fails, ye people perysh and go to havoc. For
man lives not with bread alone, Math. iiii.
but with every word that comes out of thy mouth, Prove. xix.
where no knowledge of ye and of thy blessed word is, there is no goodness for
the soul. Yea there does ye soul pine away, as the body for wa^te of
corporal food, Hebru xiii.
and is moved and led away with every wind of doctrine, be it true or false.
Math. vii* xvii.
Nether is it to be wo^dred at. For the ignorant and vntaughte bylde not their
faith upon the rock, that is, upon thy son Christ, and upon his holy
Gospel, against the which the very gates of hell can not preuail, Math. vii.
nether can the raging floods, Luke. vi.
nor the boistrous winds move them that so bilde, but upon the sands,
therefore are they thrown down with every blast, and myserably led which
way their teachers lust. This was evidently perceived in us (o blessed
father) which so many years for want of knowledge of thy blessed word were to
much wrechedlyled captyue of Satan and of his ministers, which changed them
selfs into angels of light, when in deed they were the bond slaves of
Antichriste, and believed and did whatsoever they commanded us to believe or to
do. ^. Cori. xi.
The man of sin that son of perdicion, so sat in our consciences, that we
fered him more then the our Lord god. His trifling traditions, his crooked
co^stitucions, and diuelishe decrees, ii. (...)
were more earnestli regarded believed and obeyed the^ thy blessed word whereof we
were altogether ignorant. His ceremonies, we thought to be thy service. His
dreams we esteemed true godliness. We worshypped the not after thy word, but
after Antichrists tradycio^s. As for thy holy Gospel, we knew no part of it
a right. Yea Antichrist and his impes condemned thy holy Bible for heresy, and
brent it as most abhomynable doctrine unto the great grife of al godly
persons. Many other notable works also co^piled by thy faithful servants
for the auauncement of thy glory and for bryngyng of the simple people unto
the knowledge of thy truth, they cru^llye burnte and destroyed after the
examples of the wicked kings, Ioachim and Antiochus. (...). xxxvi.
And as for the authors of the^, some those bloody Edomits brent, i. ^ath. i.
some they murdered preuely some they emprisoned, flocked, cheyned and put
to shame, al, even so mani as they could get, they cruelly and most tirantlike
entreated after the example of their predecessors the high priests of Iewry,
(...). ^xvii.
which sought al means possible both with tyrany and brybes, to keep down thy
son Christ and his glorious gospel, yt they alone might reygn: O most gentle
god, when these belly^d hipocrites and chaplens of Baal, had brent thy holy
Bible, so yt we the simple people might not read the word of our soul
health, in our own mother tongue, again when these false anointed
shauelinges had killed and put to flyghte thy true ministers and godly
prechers, mat. xxiiii.
the^ made they us to believe as they would, to walk, to do, to speak as they
lusted, to honor and worship the, Math. xv.
not after thy holy law, but after the tradycions and doctrins of men, to do
works not commanded of the, but such as their idle brains fa^sied without
authority of thy word. O Lord thou long sufferynge God, with how great
blyndenesse were we overwhelmed of these antichristian monstures when they
taught to run a Pilgrimage to this and that Idol, to paynt this tabernacle, and
to gyld that Maumet, to pray to this he Saint and to that she Saint, to bie
other men's merits, and to seek salvation in them, to put our trust in
water, salt, bread, palms, ashes, wax, oil, creme, bells, pardons, rotten
relics and such other pelti^g pedlarye, to believe that our souls after this
present life should be boiled and perboiled in antichrists furnace, there to lie
piteously yelli^g, puling and crying til they were redeemed with Diriges, Masses,
tre^tals, ladies Psalters* etc. to believe yt our sins could not be forgeuen till
we had whyspered our sins into the Priests ear, and to receive absolucion
at his hand: to believe that after the words of co^secracion, as they call them,
there remain no more bread nor no more wine in the sacrament of Christ's body
and blood, but that the bread is changed into the natural flesh of thy dear
son Christ Jesus, and the wine into his most precious blood,
that was shed for our sins upon the altar of the cross when
notwithstanding the Papists them selfs do many times keep the bread so
long, that it both mouldeth, stynketh and bredeth full of worms, and afterward
they burn it according to their own law. Ah Lord, thus were we to much
wretchedly mocked and led captive of antichriste and his disciples. The
darknesses wherein we walked were so great, that they might be felt. i. Pet^r. i,
But thanckes be unto the (o most merciful father) which haste called us out
of the darcknes of men's tradycyons into the glorious light of thy gospel. We
have now learned, that Antichriste and his members have long deceived us, and
taught us their own drowesye dreams instead of thy blessed word. We now
know, that thou requireste not of us, that we should run gadding to stocks and
stones, Math. xx^.
but that we should visit such as are sick and in prysonne and comfort the^.
We now know, that thy will is not that we should paynt tabernacles and gyld
images, but rather that we should cloth the pore and help the nedi. (...) lviii.
We now know that it is vain to pray to this or to ye saint seeing they nether
here us nor yet can help us. We have learned of thy blessed word, (...) ^iii.
(...) vii.
that Christ the son is our alone intercessour mediator and advocate. We now
know, (...) ii.
yt no salvation is to be looked for in any ceremonys, but only in thy great
mercies set forth freely to al penitente sinners through faith in Christ's
blood. We now know that, Christ's blood is the alone Purgatory of our
souls, ^ John. i.
which purges and makes us clean from all sin. We now know, that when
soever we repent confess our sins unto the, and believe to have remission of
al our sins, John. i. Ephe i. Collos. i.
through Christ's blood, we shall surely be forgeuen. Yet despise we not but
rather hertely de^yre the counsel of godly and learned preachers,
which with ye comfortable words of the gospel may raise up, strengthen and
confirm our weke conscience against Satan, sin, death, hell and desperacion.
We now know that ye Mass mongers have without al shame lied unto us, when
they taught us to believe, that ye Mas, which they mumbled, was a propiciatorye
sacrifice, and of as great virtue, strength and power, as the glorious
passion of our savior Jesus Christ, and that it was necessary both for the
quycke and dead. Ad salutem. We now know also, that ye sacrament of Christ's
body and blood is not the very self real and natural body and blood of
Christ, but an holy sign, Note.
figure and toke^ of his blessed body and precyouse blood. For this word
sacrament is as much to say as a sign of an holy thing. Now that which
is the sign of a thing, cannot be the thing it self. And though thy son
called the bread his body, and the wine his blood, because the disciples
should the better remember the breaking of his body and the sheddynge of his
blood (as he likewise called him self a vine a door, John. xv.
a rock, when not with standing he was nether natural vine, John. ^.
Math. vii. and.xvii.
material door or stony rock, but only lykened unto them for certain
properties, which he has with the vine, door* and rock) yet is neither the
bread his natural body, nor the wine his natural blood, as diverse of the
aunciente Doctors do declare and prove but only a figure of his body and
blood.
The bread is called Christ's body, because it visibly^ preaches and brings
to our remembrance the breki^g of Christ's body. The wine also is called
Christ's blood, because it puts us in remembrance of the sheddi^g of
Christ's blood. Of such phrases and manners of speaking thy holy scriptures
are full. But as in many other things so likewise i^ this blessed sacrament
have the Papists for the mayntena^ce of their Idle and beastli life most
foulye deceived us, making us to worship a wafer cake and a sponeful of wine
myngled with water, in stead of our savior Jesus Christ God and manne. And
this Idolatrus error is yet so rustered and ca^kered in ye hertes of many
both learned and unlearned (whose minds, ii. Cor. i^ii.
judgments senses and wyts the God of this world, eue^ the devil, has
blinded) that the light of ye glorius gospel of christ should not shine unto
the^, yt they cast away this doctrine as heresye, and go forth still of an
obstynate and froward mind to worship ye bread and wine as god, and condemn
al other for heretics, which hold ye contrary. O lord, these bread
christians may well be rese^bled to the men of Babilo^, which would not be
persuaded by any means but that Bell and the great Dragon, who^ they daily
worshipped and offered unto, Dan. x^iii.
were living godds, and therefore sought they al means possible to destroy
both Daniel and the king, because they taught the contrary, and braste those
Idols, giving commandment that the living God alone, which thou art, should be
honored and worshipped of al nations in the world. But we, O Lord, to who^
thou haste reveled the misteris of thy godly truth; and delivered out of the
kyngedome of darckenesse, confess our selfs to be great lie bounden unto the for
thy mercyful benefyte. We therefore beseech the to give us grace, so to walk in
this glorious light of thy holy Gospel, as it becomes ye children of light
in all goodness, Ephe. v.
righteousness and truth. Thou haste delivered us from stinking Sodom, suffer
us no more to look back toward it. Gene. xi.
Thou have brought us home again from Babylon, y^ land of bondage, unto the
new Jerusalem. Grant yt we being delivered out of the hands of our enemis
may serve the in holiness and righteousness all the dais of our life. Luke. i.

We have seen Christ thy son and our king, suffer us no more to return

We have put our hand to the ploughe, grante that we never look back again,
but persevere contynew and go forward unto the end. Let it be never said to us,
as thy son said unto the Jews: Math. xxi.
the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and shall be given to a people, which
shall bring forth the fruits of it. Make us fruteful fig trees. Give us
grace, to be rich and plenteouse in all good works, As we confess the with
our words: so let us expres the with our works. As we favor and love thy
Gospel, so let us follow and love thy gospel. For that servant which
knoweeth his masters will and does it not, shall be beaten with mani stripes. If
after we have escaped from the filthynesse of the world through the knowledge
of the, Luke. xii.
and of our savior Jesus Christ, we are tangled again therein and overcome, ^ii.
(...). ii.
then is the latter end worse with us then the beginning. For it had been better
for us not to have known the wai of righteousness, the^ after we have known
it, to turn from the holy commandment given unto us. So might it be said of
us according to the true proverb. Pro. xxvi.
The dog is turned to his ^omit again, Pr^. ^xvi.
and the sow that was washed, to her walowi^g in ye mire. Grant therefore we
most humbly pray the, that according to our knowledge we may lead an honest
conuersacio^ among all men, i. Peter. ii.
that they which backbyte us as evil doers, may see our good worckes, and
glorify the our heavenly father in the day of visitacion. Amen.

A thankesgeuinge unto God for all his benefits.
VE most heartelye thancke the (O LORD God our heavenly father) for thy
mamanyfolde and inestimable benefits, which thou haste given unto us both
for our body and soul, yea and freely eue^ of thine own goodness without
our desearte. We thancke the that it has pleased thee of thy great mercy
first to create and make us according to thine own image and lykenes, Gene. i.
and to place us in joyful paradyse, Sapi ii.
where we should continually have remained in a blessed and quiet state, if
through ye subtle and deceitefull suggestions of of Satan our old enemy, Gene.
iii.
we had not transgressed thy holy commandment. We thancke the also (O most
gentle father) for thy loving kindness, which thou shewedst unto us, when we
all were perished and lost through the sin of our first father Adam. For
when thou might justly have condemned us and cast us into perpetual
da^nacio^, thou like a father of singular great love had pity on us, and
sauedst us by the death and passion of thy well-beloved son our Lord and
savior Jesus Christ, ii. Tim. ii.
which gave him self a ransom for all our sins, and paid a sufficient
price by his precious blood, for all the wyckednes that we at any time
heretofore have committed, i. John. i. Hebru* x^
or hereafter shall commit through our frailtye and weakness, so that we
repent, believe and amend. Neither wast thou thus contented, that he only
should dye for our sins, but thou also did raise him up again for our
iustificacion, Roma iiii.
and to make us ryghtous in thy sight. Moreover after that he had showed him
self unfeigned lie alive to his Apostles by manifest and evident tokens, certain
days after his resurreccion, Mat. xxvii^
through the power of his godhead, he ascended up into heaven, perfect God and
perfect man, Luke xxiiii.
where he now sits on the right hand and makes intercession for us,
Acts. i.
being our alone mediator and advocate. i. Timo. ii.
From thence we look for him to come again at the day of judgment, John. ii.
A^t^s. i.
not as a cruel judge to condemn and cast us away, but as a most louinge
Lord and gentle savior, Math. xxv.
to carry us with him unto everlasting glory, i. Tes. iiii.
there worlds without end to remain in such joys as eye have not seen nor
ear has heard, Esaias. liiii.
i. Cor. iii.
nor yet is any heart able to think. For those thy most bounteous gifts and
for all other thy benefits, which thou daily geuest unto us of thy great mercy
both for our body and soul, we most humbly thank the, most gentle and
merciful father, besechynge the that thou will give us grace through thy holy
spyrit not to be unthankful, but to walk worthy of this thy kindness and so to
behave ourselfs all our life time in this wretched world according to thy
holy will, that at the last day we may be found in ye number of them, to who^
thy only begotten son, shall say: Mat. xxvi.
come ye blessed of my father, po^ses the kingdom, which was prepared for you
from the beginning of ye world. Lord let it so come to pass

A prayer for the sick to be said of the congregacyon*
O Jesus the alone sauyoure of the world, and the only true Physician both of
body and soul, we are come together at this present before the thorn of thy
godly Majesty to offer our humble prayers unto the for our sick and weak
brother whom thou haste visited with thy loving rod of correccio^, whereby thou
offerest thyself unto him as a most gentle father to his dear son, and by
temporal punishment ^uttest away eternal pains, which both he and all we
through our sinful living have most ryghtouslye deserved and by making the
outeward man weke, thou comfortest and make strong the inward man, which is
made like to thy glorious image. We most entirely beseech the, mercifully to
behold this our weke brother, and as that piteful Samaritane to pour wine and
oil into his wounds and to bind them up, that is, to relieve him, and to
comfort him, and to cherysh him with thy holy spirit, to make him strong in
his inward man that in the mids of his syckenes, he may not only ^ere the
cross, that thou haste laid on him pacyently, and so show him self
conformable to thy blessed will, but also thanckfully praise thy holy name for
thy fatherly correccion, and with unfeigned and strong faith, say: The lord
gave me my health, the Lord has taken it away again. As it has pleased the
lord, so it is come to pass, now blessed be the the name of the Lord. Oh it is
for my great profyt, that the lord has thus visited me, even yt I should
learn to forsake mine own will, and to walcke in his holy ordynaunces. I am
his creature, and a sheep of his pasture, let him deal with me, as seems good
in his godly syghte. For whyther I live or dye, I am the Lords. His will
therefore be done and not mine. Give him grace (O sweet Jesus) thus to be
persuaded of thy good will toward him even in the mids of his most bitter
agonyes, that he faint not under the cross, but patiently and thanckefully
abide thy good pleasure, and with earnest faith call on thy blessed name, which
is a strong tower for all them that fle unto it.

Moreover forasmuch, O Lord as it is not thy property always, to chyde, always to
be angry always to punyshe, neither to deal with us according to our sins,
nor yet to reward us after our iniquities, but as thou take away, so geuest
thou again, as thou bryngest down to the grave, so liftest thou up again, as
thou make weak, so make thou strong again: We most humbly beseech the,
if it be thy godly pleasure the rather at the conte^placio^ of these our
prayers to restore unto our weak brother after this his long sickness the
confortable benefyte of joyful health. And as thou haste brought him low
with la^ing thy heavy cross on him, so we most heartily beseech the, if it be
thy godly will, raise him up again by restoryng unto him his former health,
that he may live and continue here among us unto the glory of thy name and the
comfort of us his neighbors.

But if thy godly pleasure have otherwise determined, that by this his sycknes
thou will call him from this vale of miseri and place him in thy glorious
kingdom, which alone is the true, joyful and greatly longed for contre of al
thy chosen and faithful people: we most entierly pray the in ye mean while to
give him grace patiently and thankfully to bear his cross, diligently to call
on thy holy name, valeauntly to fight against all the tentacions of the devil,
the flesh and the world, and faithfullye to believe, that the merits of thy
blessed passion and precious blood are the full satisfaccion for all his
sins, and have made a perfect atonement and frendlye reconciliacio^ between
god the father and him. Grant O most merciful savior, that his whole heart
and mind may so be set upon the, that at what soever hour thou call him
out of this wretched world, he may be willing and glad to depart from it, and
to come unto the. O let the remembrance of the joys of heaven be so fervent
in his breast, that all wordlye things may wax vile in him, and a perfect
desire found in him to be losoned out of this bodi, and to be with y^ in glory.
And when ye time comes, that he shall give over to nature, and depart out of
this miserable world, though the pains of death take away the use of his
tongue and speech, yet grant that his heart may cry unto the and say: O
Lord, I commend my soul into thy hands. Lord Jesus take my spirit unto
thee. Grant also most loving Lord that when death has shut up the eyes of his
body, he may with the eyes of his soul, behold and look upon thy glorious
majesty in thy heavenly kingdom, where thou with the father and the holy
Ghost lyuest and reignest one true and everlasting God in all honor and glory
worlds without end.

Amen.
A prayer to be said for all such as lie at the point of death.
O Most loving Savior and gentle redemer, which cammest into this world to
call sinners unto repentance, and to seek up yt was lost, thou see in what
case this our brother lies here: visited with thy mercyful hand al weak,
feeble, sick and ready to yield up his soul into thy holy hands. O look upon him
(most gentle savior) with thy merciful eye, pity him and be favorable unto
him. He is thy workmanshippe, despise not therefore the work of thine own
hands. Thou sufferedst thy blessed body and thy precious blood to be shed for
his sins, and to bring him unto the glory of thy heavenly father, let it not
therefore come to pass, that thou should suffer so great pains for him in
vain. He was baptized in thy name, and gave himself wholly to be thy servant,
forsakynge the devil, the world and the flesh, confess him therefore before
thy heavenly father and his blessed angels to be thy servant. Prou. xvi.
His sins, we confess, ar great (for who is able to sai, mi heart is clean
and I am fre from sin) but thy mercyes, o Lord, are much greater. Ma^h. ix.
And thou ca^mest not to call y^ ryghteous, but sinners unto repentance. M^th^.
xi,
To them that are disesed and ouerladen with the burden of sin doste thou
promise ease. Thou art that god, Ezec. xviii.
which willest not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should turn and
live. Thou art the savior which wishest all men to be saved, i. Timo. ii.
and to come to the knoledge of thy truth Withdraw not therefore thy merci from
him because of his sins, but rather lay upon him thy saving health, that thou
may show thy self toward him to be a savior. What greter praise ca^ there
be to a phisicio^, the^ to hele ye sick? Nether ca^ th^r be a gr^ter glory, to
the being a ^auiour then to save siners save hi^ therefore, o lord for thy name
sake Again let ye law b^ ^o ^orsiffe to his conscience but rather give hi^
grace even in this extreme agoni and conflict of death to be fully persuaded
that thou by thy death have taken away al his si^s, Ro^^* i.
fulfilled ye law for him and by this means delivered him from the curse of
the law, Galath. iii
and paid his ransom: yt he thus being fully persuaded may have a quiet
heart, a fre conscience, and a glad will to forsake this wretched world: and to
go unto ye his lord god. Moreover thou have conquered him that had rule of
death, eue^ satan, Hebru, ii.
suffer him not therefore to exercise his tirranny upon this our sick brother,
nor to disquiet his conscience with ye errors of sin and pains of hell. Gse^.
xiii.
i. Cori. xv.
Let not Satan nor his infernal army tempt him further the^ he is able to
bear but evermore give him grace even unto his last breath valeantly to fight
against the devil witha a strong fayeth in thy precyouse blood yt he may fight
a good fight and finish his course with joy un the to glory of thy name, and
the health of his soul. O lord so work in him by thy holy spirit, that he with
al his heart may contempne and despise al worldly thyng^s, and set his mind
who^ly upon heavenly things, hopyng for the^ with a strong and undoubted faith.
Again let it not grieve him o swet savior to be lo^oned from this vile and
wretched carcass, which is now so full of sorrow, trouble, anguysh sickness,
and pain: but rather let him have abent and ready will, through thy goodness
to put it of, yea and that with this faith* that he. at the last day, shall
receive it again in a much better state then it is now or ever was from the
day of his birth, Phil. iii.
even a body incorruptible, immortal and like to thy glorious body. Let his
whole heart and mind be set only upon the^ Let the remembrance of the ioies of
heaven be so fervent in his breast that he may both patiently and thanckfully
take his death, ii. Cori. xv.
and ever wish to be with the in glory. And when the time comes, that he
shall give over to nature and depart from this miserable world vouchesafe we
most humblye beseech the, O Lord Jesus to take his soul into thy hands, and
to place it among the glorious company of thy holy angels and blessed Saynctes,
and to keep it unto that most joyful day of the general resurrection, that
both his body and soul through thine almighty power being knit again together
at that day, he may for ever and ever enjoy thy glorious kindom and sing
perpetual praises to thy blessed name. Amen.

A thankesgeuynge unto God for the departure of the faithful out of this world.
O How can we (most loving father) render unto the sufficient thanks for thine
in estimable goodness toward thy faithful servants, whom thou calling out of
this wretched world, vouchestsafe to place in thy heavenly kingdom among the
glorious company of thy holy angels and blessed saints. Psalm. cxv.
O full precious is the death of the faithful in thy sight. Blessed are the
dead that dye in the, O Lord: Apoc. xiiii.
For they are at reast from their paynful trauails and labors. The souls of
the righteous are in thy hand, Sapi. iii.
O God, and the pain of death shall not touch them. In the syghte of the
unwise they appear to die, but they are in peace. They shine as the sparckes,
that run through the reed bushe. Danie. xii.
They glyster as ye shining of heaven. They are as ye stars, world without
end. They are as ye angels of God. Math. xx^i. Apoc. iiii
They are clad with white garments, and have golden crowns upon their heads
They do service day and night before the glorious throne of thy divine Majesty.
Apoca vii.
They nether honger nor thirst any, more neither does the sun or any heat fall
upon them for the lamb which is in ye mids of the thron, governs the^, and
ledeth them unto the living fou^tains of waters. They follow the la^be
whithersoeuer he goes. They have such ioies* E^ay lxiii. i. ^or. iii.
as eye has not seen, nor ear has herd neither is th^r any heart able to
thi^ck them. Infinite and unspeakable are the tresures, O Lord, which thou
haste laid up for them, that depart in thy faith. For these thy fatherly
benefyts toward ye souls of the fayethful, and for that it has pleased the to
call our Christian brethren and sisterne from this vale of misery unto thy
heavenly kingdom, we give unto the most herty thanks, humbly beseching the that
thou will take like care for us, and so govern us with thy holy spirit both
in sycknes and in health, that we may live a good and godly life in this
preas^nte world, and whenever it shall be thy good pleasure to call us hence, we
may with strong faith in the, and in thy son Christ Jesus our Lord, comme^d
both our bodies and souls into thy merciful hands and through thy goodness be
placed in thy glorious kingdom, among thy faithful chose^ people, and so for
ever and ever praise and magnify the our heauenli father, to whom with thy
derely beloved son Jesus Christ our Lord and savior, and the holy ghost that
most sweet comfortour be al glory and honor worlds without end. Ame^.
