A new song to the great comfort and rejoicing of all true English hearts, at
our most Gracious King JAMES his Proclamation, upon the 24. of March last past
in the City of London.
To the tune of Englands pride is gone.
IR
SWeet England Rejoice and sing,
Lovingly: lovingly:
God has sent us now a King,
Praised be him.
Of King HENRY'S Lineage is he
Princely borne by degree.
A brauer Prince cannot be,
then is Noble King James.
Queen Elizabeth she is gone,
Gloriously: Gloriously:
Up to an Angels Throne,
ever to dwell.
So prudent was her mind,
So careful and so kind:
All her State she has assignd,
to our Noble King James.
Long ruled she this Land,
Virtuously: Virtuously:
King James now takes in hand,
all the like care.
He is our Royal King,
And our Country will defend.
A peaceful Reign Sweet Jesus send*
to our Noble King James.
The Nobles of this our Land,
faithfully: faithfully:
Have set to their willing hands,
All in dear love.
Giving him his lawful right,
Sweet Englands Crown so bright,
Which makes our Hearts delight,
to say God save King James,
Ring out your Bells a pace,
merrily: merrily,
Make Bone-fiers in every place,
signs of true-loue.
For England does now possess,
A King of true Nobleness:
Oh, let us love express,
to our Noble King James.
Four Kingdoms now are known,
rightfully: rightfully:
To be King James his own,
peacefully still.
Then what Prince or Potentate,
With him dare make debate,
Or envy at the state,
of our noble King James.
Other Lands will stand in fear
dreadfully, dreadfully,
When they his name shall hear
all the world over.
All Countries well may sing
England has now a King
Whose name does honor win
that is noble King James.
Englandes fair Roses bud
gallantly: gallantly:
Long may his Princely blood,
Reign in this Land
Then Popery comes not hear,
Hated of Prince and Peer
All England loves thee dear,
Noble King James.
Gods gospel thou do maintain,
Zealously: zelously:
And all untruths wilt disdain
virtuously still:
Flourish fair England then
And all true Englishmen:
Joys are now come again
with noble King James.
Gallant King, come apace,
speedely: speedely:
Thy Subjects would see thy Face
shining in Court:
Thy Nobles hear shall thou find
Faithful and true of mind
And all thy Commons kind
noble King James.
England now lives in peace,
thankefully, thankefully,
Good Lord the same increase
evermore still.
Love we our King and Queen,
Then shall our days be seen
Ever to flourish green
under King James.
Pray we for his Counsel grave
Zealously, zealously.
That they may true knowledge have.
Concord and love.
So shall our Country be,
Graced with Victory:
Thus love we Loyally,
Noble King James.
Finis.
