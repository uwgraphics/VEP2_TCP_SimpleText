TO THE RIGHT HONORAble Robert, earl of Essex and Ewe, vicount of Hereford,
and Bourghchier, Lord Ferrer^ of Chattley, Bourghchier and Louayne, master of
the Queens majesty's horse, Robert Green wishes increase of honor and virtue.
THe Egyptians (right honorable) seeing the counterfeit of Mercury figured
with his Caduceus in his right hand, offered for sacrifice nothing but bay
leaues^ in that they knew such oblations best ted his humor: Such as sought to
beautify the temple of Pallas, set up for Jewels books and shields, for that
the goddess did most patronage learning and soldiers: Hectors delight was
martial discipline, and they presented him with horse and armor, noting by
these presidents, how all have sought in their presents to keep a decorum:
having by hap chanced on some part of Ephues counsel touching the
perfection of a soldier, sent from Silexedra his melancholy cell to his
friend Philautus new chosen general of certain forces, wherein under the
shadow of a philosophical combat between Hector and Achilles, imitating
Tullies orator, Platoes common wealth, and Baldessars courtier, he aymeth at
the exquisite portraiture of a perfect martialist, consisting (says he) in
three principal points; wisdom to govern; fortitude to perform;
liberality to encourage: I thought good (right honorable) (having heard of
your noble and vertous resolutions, not only in laudable and honorable
qualities, generally inserted in your Lordships mind, but especially in the
favor of warlike endeavors, following the steps of your honorable father)
whose life and actions left an admiration of his Virtues, to present your
Lordship with this homely gift, imperfect as the half formed counterfaite of
Apelles: and shadowed with such bad colors, as might I not excuse my
boldness, in that blind men are ever most rash, and honorable men ever the
most courteous, I should the more grieve at my inconsidered presumption: but
two especial conjectures do somewhat salve the sorrow of my forward folly:
the first, the report of your approved courage and valor (in the low
Countries) showed in the face of your enemy, maintained with such a
magnanimious resolution, as the foe was feign to confess Virtue in his
adversary: the second, your Lordships courtesy in acceptaunce of good will
from the meanest: the one manifesting your desire to be thought an honorable
soldier, bids me hope, that as Alexander did vouchsafe of Misons rude and
unpolished picture of Mars: for that the prince delighted in wars, so your
honor will give a glance at this toy, if not for the workmanship, yet for that
it treats of martial discipline: the other assures me, that amongst many
other, I shall, though without desert, ^aste of your Lordships honorable
courtesy, in vouchsafing such a mean and unsavory present, wherewith if I be
favored (as I hope well) my labor has his reward, and my desire his content:
in which assured hope resting, I commit your honor to the almighty.

To the Reader.
GEntlemen, by chance some of Euphues loose papers came to my hand, wherein he
writ to his friend Philautus from Silexedra certain pinciples necessary to be
observed by every soldier, coniecturing with my self the opynion of the man
would be not only authentical, but pleasing, and that the time required such
a discourse, as necessary: I thought not to conceal his censure, but to
participate what I had to your courteous favors, although intended by him for
the pryuate use of his dearest friend, hoping as ever I have done to find your
courteous acceptance, and that you will for Euphues sake vouchsafe of the
matter, and requital of my travel make some favorable conjecture of my good
meaning: which hoping to obtain, I rest satisfied^

A Philosophical combat between Hector and Achilles, wherein in the persons
of the Trojan and Gretian Lords; are in four discourses in-riched with four
delightful Hystories, the virtuous minds of true nobility and gentility
pleasantly discovered.
HElena the hapless wife of unhappy Menelaus, beawtified from above, to
inflict a mortal punishment upon men beneath: honored in Greece more for her
beawty then her honesty (a fault which fondlings account for a favor)
fulfilling the dream of Hecuba, that she hatched a fierbra^d which should
bring Troy to cy^^ers: through her lawless consent to Paris, so troubled the
quietn^sse of Asia, that Priamus ^lowrishing as prince of ^^at part of the
world, was with his sons and daughters brought to ruin: (the end of
voluptuos appetites) which they mayntained with the sword. For Agamemnon
copartner of Menelaus grief (as friendship is the ^rind to reueng) aided with
all the Kings, Princes, Dukes, and Knights of Greece intended a resolute leg^r
to the city of Troy, which conti^ued ^wo years without truce, by sundry
assaults, (...), and (...), had d^uo^r^d of both part^s (...) my vahaunt
captains that by common consent after a frie^dly par^^^ they res^lued upon a
truce for thirty days during which time, the Tr^ian Ladies (resembling
Proserpina that must of necessity taste a gra^ne of the forbidden Pomgranate)
namely Andromache, Cassandra and Polixena, accompanied with Hector, Troilus,
Aeneas, Helenus, and diverse other of royal parentage, went to see the Gretian
tents peopled with their enemies. Fame (the spedy discouerer of new^s)
bewraying their intent to the states of Greece: Achilles amongst the rest (^or
that the report of Polixenas beawty had made a conquest of his affections) in
that the ^are leads to the inward senses as well as the eye, craved of the
Governor and general of their forces he might be honored with the
intertaynment of the Trojans: his request granted accompanied with his
Myrmidones, he went to meet them in this manner.

First marched on before the rest, a hundredth and fifty on the most gallaunt
Coursers that Greece did afoorde, their caparisons of Green Ueluet interseamed
with stars of Gold, about which was writ^en thus impre^ze, Lux and tenebra.
Next to these Achilles, mounted upon an Arabian courser color Black, whose
furniture was blewe Ueluet fringed with Gold, whereon was curiously embrodred
the Target of Pallas with a Gorgons head, his impreeze. Sic Amor. His
companions wear Ulysses, Diome, Patroclus, with many Lords of great valor
and progeny. The Gretians thus marching on in order met Hector who was first
of his company, whose very face harboring an extraordinary kind of mai^stie
gave them all to know, by supposi^ion, that this was he which by his valor
had made such dismal massacres, even to their very Pauilions. Letting him and
the rest of his crew pass with an envious courtesy, as feeling in their
minds the scarres of his man-hoode: at last Aihilles and he came within view,
who never having seen each other before, but in armor as enemies manacing
reue^g in the field, stood along time as men in a trance, till Hector burst
forth into speeches.

Lords of Greece, enemies by defiaunce, and yet frinder vy Fortune, hoping to
find you as firm in promise of truce, as resolute in performaunce of valor,
in that noble minds prefer honor before conquests: The Ladies of Troie
(whose princely thoughts account none enemies but in Armor) noting from ye
Walls your experience in martial discipline desirous to praise virtue in an
enemy, are come under the conduct of naked knights (yet armed by the law of
arms) to see if the Gretian policy in cyuill court^sie, be comparable to
their prowes in warlicke endeavors. This only cause has made the Ladies thus
far aduenturous, if they have license to pass further, their sight
satisfied, and the end of their desires favored with well construing of their
trauells: They mean, safe returned, to make requital with thanks and
praise, the truest tokens of liberality, and surest defensories against
ingratitude. If their labor be in vain, and further grant of passage
denied, to make a counterpoyse of discourtesie to the vtteraunce, I auow by the
oath of knighthoode to seal the sum of such injury (the truce ended) at the
tent of your general maugre Achilles, and all his Myrmidones, and for that you
shall challeng what I promise in silks to be performed in Armor. Know I am
Hector. His chardge given him by the Ladies uttered. The Lords of Gre^ce
pawsing upon the magnanimity of Hector that durst amidst his enemies resolve
^ppon revenge. Achilles whose senses generally were troubled with special
objects, lending as well his eye to the beawty of Poli^ena, as his ^are to the
parlee of Hector gathering his wits together returned him bouldly and
briefly this answer.

The Gretians worthy Lords whose fore pointed resolutions are ever limited
within the proportion of Justice, hold their words as laws, and sacrifice
their thoughts with their deeds, at the Aultars of equity, measuring enemies
at the point of the Lance and frindes by perfourmance of league, using their
hands and hearts as the instruments of Delphos, which might not be touched by
any appeached of perjury: honoring Ladies as well in armor as in Laurel, and
counting it the chief point of cheiualrie to succor the oppressed enemy with
the sword: these premises considered in the behalf of the rest, I confirm
specially to the Ladies as enforced by duty, and yet generally to all, as
constrained by promise a frindly welcome. For whose safty I pawn the pledge of
a prince, which is honor. Threts that are conditional are the more easily
broked, and therefore omitting such fryuolous suppo^itions lovely Ladies of
Troy and your attendaunts, I swear a hearty welcome: for performaunce of
which, take the faith of Achilles. This promise past these two princes embraced
each other, the rest of the Lords imitating their mutual favors, interchanged
the like courtesies, so that joining their Troops together, they road on
toward the camp. Achilles who knew as well how to tune the Lute with Venus,
as to sound the Trumpet with Mars, and had as great affability in his tongue to
intertayne a Lady, as strength in his hand to repulse an enemy, that could as
well lead a dance as follow a march: after general courtesies past between
the Gretian Lords, and the Dames of Troy, he subtelly singled him self with
Polixena whom he held in prattle to his tent in this manner.

^ see Madame, that your father Priamus is as pollitick^ ^o make a conquest, as
his sons be valiant to attempt a victory, and that his endeavor to
captyuate our minds will be of more effycacie then their labor to weaken our
forces, for that beawtie is of more vigor then prowess, and affection a sorer
enemy to resist then fortitude: Hercules found the sight of Deianyra more
perilous then all the rest of his trauells. Mars had rather oppose him self
against all the Gods, then enter a jar with Venus. Beawty is metaphysicall,
and therefore challenges a supremacy above Nature: Exterior actions are tied
to the Wings of Fortune, but thoughts as they are passionate, so they are
within the compass of Fancy, I speak this Madame, in that the Senators of
Troy seeing how well the Greeks are able to brook the force of Hector and
Troilus, the two hopeful Champions of Asia, have now not in defiaunce, but
under Patronage of Truce sent such sweet enemies, as are able with their very
looks to make a greater conquest, then all your hardy knights with their
Lances; if then Madame unarmed as we be, beawtie take us at discouert, and
make a Breach ma^gre our teeth into our rampires, yet hold we our selves good
Soldiers in that her weapons are inchaunted, and such as the more they are
resi^ted the more they pearce. Polixena who as she was fair, so she was wise,
seeing how clarkely Achilles began to claw her by the Elbowe, willing to let
him know she was able to epsy a pad in the straw, cut him of in the midst of
his talk with this answer.

I cannot think sir but my father Priamus stands in better hope to fire the
Pauylions of his enemies with a Brande then with a Book, and puts more
assurance in the valor of his Sons then in the counsel of his Senators,
yet knowing the Goddess Pallas whose sacred Palladium we have in Troy, uses
as well a pen as a Spear, he counts pollycie a necessary frinde to
prowess, and a Scholars Laurel wreath, no disgrace to a Soldiers steeled
Helmet. But whereas in ^^shonour of our knights, you allege he has sent
Ladies to make a conquest by beawtie that cannot be achieved with the
Swoorde: This were (good sir) but a slender shift to deceive him self, for we
know that the eye being impartial in censuring of coullers never flattereth
it self in the emblazing of Beawtie. The Gretian Ladies then being far our
superiors in those favors which the Graces give, commands us to blush at
comparisons, I must as simple as I am suppose your coniect^re dissimuled, since
so little probability draws me on to belief. But put case this supposition
bear some liklihood of truth. Do we not know our enemies are Gretians,
taught in their Schoolles amongst their Philosophers, that all wisdom is
honest that is profitable, that their heads are as full of subtelty, as their
hearts are of valor, how their thoughts are plumed with the feathers of time,
and that fancy hangs at their eylids which never makes so deep an
impression, but it may be shaken of at every wincke for an instaunce. Give me
leave to allege Theseus, who was as valiant as most, and yet says Helena as
variable as might be. Then sir fear not our forces, for we Ladies come but to
fetch ^ier, neither to see as desirous to choose, nor to be seen as willing
to please, only to try the Greatian courtesy, and that we look for by
promise. Achilles amazed with the check of such an unlooked for mate,
perceiving that the Ladies of Troie had a deep in-sight into the Gretian
actions, blushed at his own conceiptes in yt he knew better how to redouble a
blow upon his enemy, then give a counterchecke to such a subtle reply, yet
following his footing, thus he made answer.

It Is hard in deed Madame, to harbor belief in the bozome of mistrust, or to
blind suspicion with a false couller, especially when conceit stands at the
door of an enemy. But were there a league between Asia and Greece, as a
Flagge of defiaunce waueth over the walls of Troy, then might a creple hal^
without check, whereas ^ow, tread we neaer so even, our steps are supposed
aw^ye. But time the perfect Heralt of truth shall prove the Gretians so far
out of love with the God Ianus, that frown he never so much they will not
offer him a myte for a Sacrifice. Your honor my Lord (quoth Polixena) does
but dream with Endymion in the mount. Women's wills are peremptory and like
Faulcons sometime they will bate at a full fist. Time is ye best orator to a
resolute mind, and therefore argue not where a principle is denied, for there
the party is incredulous. Let love alone for we come not to feed our eyes with
beawty nor our ears with passions, our country smoke burns clear enough
for us to warm us at, setting down, which rest, I pray you my Lord whose
tent is this that appears so rich. Achilles seeing the ston^ was so pure that
his coin would bear no touch, fell from his amorous prattle and told her
that the foremost of azur^ bisse, topt with a Dragon, perced with a spear, was
the pauilion of their General Agamemnon: what? the father (quoth) Polixena of
Iphigenia so famous for her wisdom and chastity, whom the Gretians have so
honored in their madrigalles as a second Diana: The same (quoth) Achilles, and
so madame you are welcome to the Greekish host, leaving of thus their private
prattle, Agamemnon accompanied with aged Nestor and other Lords, stood at the
door of Achilles tent ready to intertayne the Trojans who with the rest
dismounting from their horse, Hector pazing hand in hand with Achilles, Troilus
with Ulysses, and Helenus with Patroclus, they were together with the Ladies in
great magnificence conducted into the inner part of the pauilion: where
Agamemnon after he had saluted the Lords, and welcomed the Ladies, he presented
ye Trojans with as brave a spectacle, as they incountred the Gretians, for
there came out in most rich attire, Iphigenia, Bryseis, and Cresida, three
nothing inferior in favors to the daughters of Priamus: an interchange of
courtesy passed between these Dames, and some parlee had which I over pass,
they sat down to dynner, where sumptuously served, taking their repast without
any great talk: (...) tables taken up, Ulysses naturally desirous to have an
inught into the manners of men, began to break their silence in this manner.

I can but wonder worthy Lords of Troy at the madness of Paris, that allured
by the care, passed the seas to possess him self of a supposed Iem, sith his
own country soil aforded far more precious Jewels, but less is the
Margarite accounted of in the western world where it is found, then the seed
Pearl in a strange country where it is unknown, thoughts, the farther they
wade, the sweeter: and desires ended with perrill, savor of the greatest
delight. Open praises are counted secret flatteries, but the mouth of an enemy
seldom ouerflowes with good words, if then without prejudice I may speak of
wisdom at the shryne of Apollo. Let me say courteous Knights that your Dames,
if either ye rest be like these, or their daily actions may be measured by
their present behauior: are beawtiful^ as favored by nature in their exterior
liniame^ts. Wise, as graced with a diu^ne influence, sober and silent, as
portending a temperate and unfeigned chastity. The perfection of Nature
consisting in these points: I marvel Paris would make his choice of such a
^eece, and hasard the welfare of his father, country, and friends, for a
woman only indewed with the bare title of beawty, such a fading good as scarce
can be possessed before it be vanished? Cressida tickled, a little with a self
conceit of her own wit, willing to let ye Trojans know the phrase of her
speech was as fair as the form of her face, and that women's tounges perced
as deep as their eyes, interrupted Vlys^es in his talk thus.

And as great marvel my Lords have we the Ladies of Gretia, that Hector and
his brethren, so famous through all y^ world for their martial exploits,
should bear arms in her defense, whose dishonesty ruinates both their fame
and their country. Justice gyuing every man his due, allot^ little pryuiledge
to de^rawde a man of his wife, which is the surest fe^^^mple. The faith of a
knight is not limited by val^^r, but by virtue: fortitude consists not in
hasarding without fear, but in being resolute upon Just cause, Helena is
stolen, a fact repayed wtih infamy. Menelaus is iniuried, a thing crying for
revenge: the princely soldiers of Troy defends such a miss with the sword: a
shameful victory, if happily they might obtain the conquest. Hector as
Chollericke as she was scrupulous, roundly without longer debating with him
self, made her this answer.

As Madame, Justice in a virtue that gives every man his own by equal
proportion, so revenge the sweetest content to parsons thwar^ed with injuries,
looks not to end her actions with an even balance, but uses Legem Talio^^^,
repaying like for like: styrring up the fire with a Swoorde, and for brass
weighing down the scales with Lead. As my brother has brought a trull from
Greece, so mine Aunt, perforce (a fault far surpassing this fact) was stolen
from Troy, and from the Daughter of a king made a servile Concubyne. Nature,
that despite of time will frown at abuse and honor: that hurt thirsts to
salve her self with revenge, has taught us (although we offer Helena
thoughts fit for her offense) to maintain my Brothers deed with the Swoorde,
not to allow such a fact honorable, but as holding it princely, with death to
requite an injury. If then (quoth Ac^illes) honor hangs in revenge, I hope our
resolute minds to acquit Menelaus abuse, shall witness to the world, we
prefer a princely thought before a private life, and choose rather to die
satisfied then live dishonored. Troilus willing to show that the weapons of
Troy were as sharp ground as the swords of the Gretians, and that fear had as
little privilege to crepe within their walls as to lurk within ye others
tents, made Achilles this answer.

My Lords of Greece, the talk of a Soldier ought to hang at the point of his
sword: threats are not to be menaced with the tongue, but with the Lance, and
tune craves a proportion in all things: we came to see the order of your
Pauilions, not to discourse of atte^pts in battle. To sacrifice the talk of
wars to Mars, before Ladye^ is to offer a drum and Trumpet to dainty Venus
for a present. Greece complayneth of injury. Troy is impatient of dishonor:
both grieved aim at revenge. The Truce expired, let the doubt by the favor of
the gods and fortun^ ^e decided. The Gretians greatly commended the reply of
Troilus, so tempered with myldnesse and valor, as he seemed to hold a martial
peace in his forehead. Vlis^es greeuing that he was the author of this Jar,
seeking subtly to cast the Shackle from his own foot, followed his former
parle in this manner.

Think me not so forgetful (worthy Trojans) either of time or place, that my
intent was to mingle the bitter potions of Mars with the sweet lyquor of
Bacchus, that I meant to make a consort between the Trumpet and the Lute, or by
rehearsing of Paris loves, to call in question our open wars: Only least time
should accuse us of niggardise, and the Ladies grow to melancholy by overmuch
silence, by accusing Paris of folly I thought to discover the force of fancy,
which partial in her Cenzures proves ^^^wty more predominant in affection,
then virtue. Helena was fair and a Queen, witty and therefore the sooner
woonne, but yet di^honest, a cooling Card to desire, a stayne manifest to the
mind, and yet so quickly ouerslipt by the eye, as it sh^wes how little
Iuditiall the thoughts be of vn^ridled affection.

Had the Trojans (quoth Iphigenia Academis) like to the Gretians, or were their
cytties peopled as well with Philosophers as Soldiers, Paris had learned by
their wise precepts to have preferred Virtue before Beawty, and not to have
bought repentance so dear. Pallas stands sacred in Troy, but Priamus and his
Sons looks at her Spear, not at her book: they find in her foreheade
wars, but they see not in her Breast the pourtrature of Wisdom, they pen
down volumes of martial discipline, but know not Apian of morrall
Philosophy, which is the cause they measure all their passions by will, and
call Ve^^^ a goddess only for her outward glory. Andromac^e hearing how^
hardly Iphigenia did inueigh against their want of learning, thought a little to
be pleasant and yet Saty^icall, so that she made her this sharp answer.

In deed Madame you say well: The Gretians have such a self conceit in their
wisdom, as they count all Barbarians that are not lym^ted within the confines
of Greece, and so studious are they of philosophy that every oeconomicall
state stands upon precepts, the wife says not Salve to her husband, but
she has a warrant of her action from the Philosopher: our Ladies like homely
huswyfes beguile time which the Dystaffe, your Dames apply their minds to their
books, and become so well lettered that after long study they prove as
virtuous as Helena: give me leave Madame to bring her for a president of your
philosophical wisdom, as well as you induced Paris for an instaunce of our
barbarous ignorance.

Iphigenia seeing her self so clarkly ouertake^ in her own inuectiue, blushed,
and the noble men smiled to see how smoothly Andromache thwarted her
presumption. But Bryses willing to show her skill, made Andromache this answer.

And yet Madame by your leave, the particular instance of one woman condemns
not the general profit of good letters, Helenas dishonesty is no prejudice to
the study of philosophy, neither do our Gretian Ladies blush at her folly,
since what Greece refuses as an abject, Troy harboreth as an Idol, wherein we
may say without offense, that (such lips such lettyce) that which the Citizens
love in their hearts they maintain with the sword: Venus entreated Jupiter
for Calisto when Diana had exiled her for a refuse, and so Priamus honors her
for a Goddess that we hated for a Strumpet. Cassandra who all this while
buried up this talk in silence, at last as forced to speak in defense of her
country began in this manner.

Greece in deed swarmeth with Philosophers, the fathers and forepointers of
wisdom, but ^he learned deliver that in precepts, which the people never put
in pr^ctise: Apollo the glory of Greece and God and prophet at Delphos: saith^
that virtue is not perfect without action, that study and contemplation is
frivolous nisi adiungatur actio, for it is not sufficient, as Hermes
Tresnygistus your great Philosopher affirms to spend time in the knowledge of
any Science, unless by attayning unto that skill we show the fruits of such
doctrine in our lives. Then if action must of necessity be joined to study and
contemplation, otherwise a virtuous and happy life is not perfected, then we
Barbarians may boast of our own disposition, that honor virtue in our deeds,
which you only account for a goddess in thought, we through ignorance have
fetched a Harlot from Greece, and you that are learned make a challeng to recall
vice with the sword: whose folly is the greatest, let the verdict of one of
your own Philosophers witness, whose censure is, that, Qui inuito peccat,
minus peccat quam qui sponte peccat. This philosophical answer of Cassandra
so satisfied the Gretians, as they admyred her speech, and held her reason for
an Oracle. All driven with this censure into silence, Ulysses as he was first,
thought to be last, and therefore made this reply.

It is not seen Madame by your sweet self, but Philosophers are honou^ed in
Troie, that you have their precepts so well in memory. They which sacrifice to
Neptune can talk of the Sea, and such as honor Mars, of warlike discipline:
the stringes of ye heart reach to the tip of the tongue, thoughts are blossoms
of the mind, and words the fruits of desiers. Your physical reasons
bewraies a good naturalist, and your opinion of moral actions, an in-sight
into philosophy: therefore Madame, to give every one their due, we cannot but
confess the Trojans are as wise as warlike, and the Ladies can apply the eye
as well to the book, as the fingar to the dissafe: yet to set truth in her
prime, let me say thus much without offense, that never have I seen lawl^sse
love end without loss, nor the nuptial bed defiled escape without revenge:
m^n d^termine, but the god^ ^ispose: human actions are often measured by will,
but the ^^^sures from above are just and peremptory: Fortune is a goddess but
has no privilege in punishing of faults: which one of our Poets no^ing well,
by a plague inferred for some off^nce, yields this reason (...), it was the
will of Jupiter. To con^irm^ which, if the Trojan Lords and Ladies give me
leau^, I will rehearse a pleasant history.

We hard (quoth Cassandra) before any B^rke came within ken of Troy, that
Ag^memnon was full of Majesty, Achilles of cour^ge, Nestor of wis^^ome, Ulysses
of eloquence, an^ the rest of the ^ordes i^d^wed with sundry and seu^rall
virtues: to make a proof of which, for that Fame is often prodigal in her
praises, we adventured this parle: and therefore, paying thanks for your
pains, we promise to be silent auditors to your discourse, Vlis^es taking her
word for warrant, seeing how all the company settled themselves to silence,
began on this manner.

Ulysses Tale. A Tragedy
IN our country of Greece, and in a province called Ithaca, as the annall
records makes mention, there rayned a prince named Polumestor, happy as one
favored every way by fortune: for he was graced with a diadem as of royal
parentage borne ^o command, rich in possessions, able to be liberal in all
his attempts, wise, as sought to for his censures, like a second saint of
Delphos, and martial, as accounted one of the best Soldiers in his time:
indewed with these special favors, and adorned with sundry virtues, he was
feared of his enemies, as on^ that ended his quarrels in revenge, and loved of
his frinds as a prince, limiting no time in frindship, being every way of such
perfect disposition, both in the complexion of his body, and constitution of
his mind, as it was a question whether the lyniaments of his face, or the
proportion of his wisdom held the greater supremacy. Polumestor ^^ing thus
happy, for that nature and fortune had made him so specially happy, the
goddess, whose actions are measured by inconstancy, willing to place him on
the top of the highest Pyramides of bliss, that so being a mark for envy, the
fall of her wheel might be the end of his con^ent, and the deep declining to
mishap and misery, gave him in the prime of his years a wife, by birth
royal, fayer by nature, and learned by education, graced with such sundry
excellent and exquisite qualities, as might not only tie the affection of her
husband by endless desire to like and love her, but also force fame to make
such report of her supposed virtues, as the world should not only admyre her
perfection, but count Greece happy for possessing so fayer and virtuous a
creature. But as the Panther having the fairest skin has the most infectious
breath, and as the tree Alpyna is the more bitter, the smoother his bark is:
so nature having drawn such an absolute counterfect of beawty, as might
discover what her cunning could aforde, yet had placed in the midst of such a
myrrour so imperfect a mind, as the stain of the one did ad a disgrace to the
glory of the other. For this Lady whose name was Maedina as she had an
exterior kind of discretion so warelie to moderate her actions, as report
could not pry into her deeds, so inwardly had she such a subtle dissimulation
to cloak the foulest spot of vice with the mask of virtue, that fame feared
to enter into the discovery o^ her thoughts, so equal was the outward
proportion of her behavior. But time the Heralt that best imblazeth the
conceits of the mind, willing to make an Anatomy of her deceipts, began his
Tragedy in this manner.

In the court of Ithaca there served a Gentleman of good Parentage, though of
small Patrimony, who coveting to make a supply of his want by ye favor of his
prince, endeavored him self to all lawdable qualities, not only in the
exercise of his body, but in the devise of his mind, as well I mean in
wearing the Laurel with Pallas, as the (...) with Mars, being so courteous
both in duty to his superiors, and in affalibity to his equals, as he was
generally loved and honored of all men.

Vortymis, for so was the Gentleman's name, living thus fortunate, because
favored in the service of his prince, thinking that the fruit of time was
^auored with all one taste, found that she was of the offspring of Ianus double
faced, having as well wrinckles in the one to prognosticate mishap, as dimples
in the other to make assurance of prosperity: for envy resembling the Serpent
Hydaspis, that always purges his venom on the fairest flower, seeing that
Fortune had resolved to make him a lease of his happiness. Joining in league
with fancy, the worm that byteth sorest, the flowrishing blossoms of Youth
gave him such a braie by the means of beawty, as he for a while thinking to be
but a small check, found at last to be so hard a mate as no shift, but misery
could countermaund. For the princess whose h^nd sacrificed perfumes to Vesta
when her heart offered smoking thoughts to Venus, noting the perfection of
Vortymis (as women's eyes delight in the variet^e of objects) seeing that the
sharpness of his wit (a spark that soon^st inflameth desire) was answerable
to the shape of his body, and that his mind was adorned with so many sundry
good quallities, that if his fortune had been equal to his face, his deserts
might have made him a prince^ she began so far to enter into consideration of
his virtues, that hazarding too rashly in so dangerous a Laberinth, she felt
her mind begin to alter, and her affec^ions to stoop to such a stake as
repent she might, but recall she could not. But taking these thoughts for
passionate toys that might be thrust out at pleasure, cursing love that
attempted such a change, and blaming the baseness of her mind that would
make such a choice to avoid the Syrene y^ inchaunted her with such deceiptful
melody, she called to one of her maids for a Lute, whereupon singing a solemn
madrygale she thought to beguile such unacquainted passions, but finding that
music was but to quench the fire with a sword feels assaults to be so
sharp, as her mind was rea^^ to yield as vanquished, she began with diverse
considerations to suppress this frantike affection, calling to mind that
Vortymis was but a mean G^ntl^man, one for his birth not worthy to be looked
at of a princess, much less to be loved of such a mighty Potentate, thinking
what a discredit it were to her self, what an infamy to her husband, what a
grief to her frindes, yea what a mighty shame should be guerdon for such a
monstrous fault, blaming Fortune and accusing her own folly, that should be
so fond as but once to harbor such a thought as to fals^^ie her faith to her
husband, or stoop so low a^ one of the meanest of her subjects. As thus she
was raging against her self, Love feared, if she dallied long to loose her
champion, step^ more nigh, and gave her such a fresh wound as pearst her at the
very heart, that she wa^ feign to yield maugre her former considerations, and
forsaking all company to get her into her privy Garden, where being sollempnly
set in a cool Arbor, she burst forth into these passionat tears.

Unfortunate Moedyna, has Fame hitherto feared to speak ill of thy thoughts,
and shall report now dare to misconstrue of thy actions? has Greece honored
thee for thy virtues? and shall the whole world at last abhor thee for thy
vanities? shall the Ladies of Ithaca, who allege thee for a president of
chastity, blush when they hear of thy unbridled fancy? Nay shall Polumestor,
who desired thee for thy honorable qualities, have cause to loath thee for thy
dishonest conditions? No Moedyna, think this, there is no sweeter frinde then
fame, nor worse enemy then report: Princes thoughts as they are royal, so they
ought to look no lower then honor. More is homely Bawcis accounted of for her
honesty in her poor Cotage, then Venus withal her amors in her sumptuous
Temples: And yet Moedyna, Love is divine, feare^ of men, because honored of the
Gods: not to be suppressed by wisdom, because not to be comprehended by
reason: without law, and therefore above all law. And why fond woman do
thou blase that with pra^^es, which thou have cause to blaspheme with curses:
offer not Doves to Venus, but hemblocke: seek not to extinguish the flame with
oil, but temper the sweetest potions with the sharpest Vinegar: yea Moedyna,
blush at thy fortune, thy choice, thy love, since thy thoughts cannot be
conceived without secret shame, nor thy affections uttered without open
discredit: far are these fancies, or rather f^llies, unfit for thy birth, thy
dignities, thy kingdoms: have thou not heard as an oracle from Apollo, yt it
is better to perish with high desires, then to live in base thoughts? Daphne
chose ^ather to loose her human shape, then to make shipwreck of her
honesti^. But yet Vo^tymis is beawtifull, a favor fond fool, framed to feed
the eye, not to ^etter the heart, he is wise, so think he is virtuous and
will censure of thy actions according to desert, not desire: Tush, being both
beawtifull and wise, why should he not be loved: will thou so far forget thy
self Moedyna, as to suffer affection to suppress wisdom, and love to
violate thine honor. Let consideration (the enemy to untimely attempts) tell
thee that repentance in infamy is no amends, that there is no salve against the
hurt that comes, from report that honor lost bids a farrewell to hope,
fear then to hasard that for the gain of a momentary pleasure as is so
precious, that once cracked it can never be recovered: how dismal would the
fact be to thy husband, how sorrowful to thy subjects, how grievous to thy
frinds, how gladsome to thy foes, the greatest grief of all, since the smile of
a foe that proceeds from envy, is worse then the tear of a frinde that
comes of pity.

These premises then duly considered, prefer not a barlie corn before a
precious Jewel, set not a fading content before a perpetual honor, suppress
thy affections, and cease to love him whom thou could not love unless
blind^d with too much love. As thus she was perplexed with sundry passions,
one of her Ladies came into the Arbor whereupon she ceased her complaints,
hoping that time would wear out that which fond Love and Fortune had wrought,
calling for her work, that with easy labou^^ she might pass^ over her new
conceived ^mours. But see the old saying. Naturam expellas furea tamen osque
reccurr^t. Nature has such a predominant power over the mind as the ramage
Hawke will hardly be reclaimed, the Tygre will never be tamed, the Snayle
cannot be enforced to be swi^^: Nor, a woman that resolves possible to b^e
persuaded by reason, which Moedyna proved true, ^or so did the remembrance of
her late conceived Love alienate her thoughts from her woonted disposition:
that shame and dishonor the greatest preuenters of mishap, were no means to
diswade her from her determined ^ffection: i^ so much that not possible to hide
fire in straw, nor to smother up fancy in youth, she bare such a favorable
countenan^s to Vortymis, that not only her self but the rest of the court
marueiled at her submisse familiarity: yet in that her grace had heretofore
trodden her shoe so even, as no step was so much as thought awry, they
construed all to the best, and thought her favors toward Vortymis proceeded as
a reward for his virtues, not from a regard to his beawtie. But at last being
Venus scholar, and therefore daring with her to danc^ in a Net, she so
manifestly discovered her affections as all Ithaca spoke of her fancy, and the
Gentleman him self began to blush at her folly. For wheresoever he was
resident she made it her Chamber of presence, his words were music and
conserved with proportion, his looks were Kalenders of her thoughts, for if
he smyled she could not but laugh, and every frown of his, made a wrinckle
in her foreheade, he did nothing but if she were present past with a
plauditie: to be brief, she noted the s^quell of his life by the censure of
his own doings. Which well marke^ by Polumestor he began to be a little
Ie^lows, ^ut measuring in his consideration her fore passed life, he began
thus for his own suspicion to inu^igh against him self.

Shamest thou not Polumestor to be so inequall a Judge, as to reward virtue
with distrust, or to b^e suspicious where no occasion of doubt is offered.
Know thou not that among all the passions wherewith human minds are
perplexed, there is none that gal^eth with restless despite as that
infectious, s^^re of iealowsie, for all other greefes are to be appeased with
sensible persuasions, to be cu^ed with wholesome counsel, to be relieved by
want, or by tract of time to be worn out, Iealowsie only excepted, which is
s^ sawsed with susities, doubts and pinching mi^trust that who so seeks by
frindly co^ns^^^e to race out this hellish pass^on, forthwi^h suspecteth that
he gives this counsel to cover his own guil^inesse: yea, who so is pay^ed
with this restless torm^nt doubts all, distrusteth him self, is always
frozen with fear and fiered with suspicion, having that wherein consists all
his Joy t^ be the breeder of his misery. Yea Polumestor it is such a heavy
enemy to that holy estate of matrimony, sowing between the married couple
such deadly seeds of secret hatred as love being once raced out by sacklesse
distrust thereof, through envy e^sueth blooddy revenge. If then Iealowsie be
such a fiend as pes^ureth the mind with incessant passions, suffer not
Polumestor such a Saturnine infusion of melancholy to be predominant in thy
thoughts, oppose ye proof of thy wives virtue as a de^ensorie to withstand
suspicion, think her private familiarity with Vortymis, is an honest ^ourtesie
y^ springs from a royal courage, not from a dishonest Concubine: suppose the
best, least in urging a blameless mind, she begin to hate and endeavor to
revenge. And in this resolution Polumestor rested using his Lady with such
good and woonted favor as might have drawn her from her fool^sh
determination, for seeing her given to be solitary and sad, he provided
shows, triumphs, maskes and other pastimes ^o recreate her mind, but love
that att^mpteth a secr^t Joy with an open grief gave no content, but a pens^^e
musing of the success of her new thoughts: which thus fondly laid to the
view of every one. Vortymis not so blind but he could Judge of coullers,
espied by the half, what the whole meant, and therefore puffed a little up in
co^ceipt with the favor of a princess, seeing opportunity laid her hayrie
forehead on his lap, he began somewha^ pertly to pry into the exquisitnesse
of her perfection, seeing she was passing beawtifull, and that majesty added a
grace unto Nature, and being of royal Parentage, beawtie decked Nature with
dignity: this interchang considered, so charmed the poor Gentleman's
affections, that feign he would have made requital of her favors with like
courtesy, if her princely state, had not quatted his presumption with fear:
houe^^ng thus between two streams, at last he brast forth into these bitter
complaints.

Do thou not know poor Vortymis that actions wrought against Nature reap
despig^t, and thoughts above Fortune disdain: that what bird gaseth against
the sun but the Eagle, waxes blind, and that such as step to dignity, if
unfit ^all, that thoughts are to be measured by Fortunes not by de^iers, how
falls come not by sitting low but by clyming high: shall therefore all fear
to aspire because some hap to fall, no Vortymis thou art favored: yea and
fancied of a princess whose dignity may shi^lde thee from mishap, ah fond man
do thou count every dimple in the Cheek a Decree in the heart, every laugh
a warrant of Love. Venus looked on more then she loved, or else she was passing
amoro^s: women's smyles are often more of custom then of courtesy, and princes
are prodigal with their eyes when they are nygards in thoughts, for think
not fond man that Eagles will catch at f^^es, Cedars stoop to brambles, or
mighty princes look at such homely peasaunts, no, no, think her disdain is
greater then thy desir^, she is a princess that respects her honor, thou a
beggars bratt that forgettest thy calling, cease then not only to say but to
think she loves thee. Vortymis with these pythie persuasions somewhat
appeasing the sparkling flames of love that had already warmed his breast,
applied him self to his woonted exercises, in hunting, hawking, running at
tilt, and other pastimes wherein the king took chiefest delight: suppressing
his affections with the due consideration of her Majesty and his mean estate,
and counting it frenzy not fancy, to count that which the very Destynies
would deny him to obtain. But Moedyna was more impatient in her passions, for
love so fiercely assailed her that neither place, company, time, nor music
could mitigate any part of her lawless martyrdom, but did rather far more
increase her malady. Shame the hand-maide to dishonest attempts, would not let
her crave counsel in this case, nor fear of report suffer her to reveal it
to any secret frinde, but she made a secretary of her self, and did
participate her thoughts with her own troubled mind. Lingering for the time,
till at last fortune willing in a sweet fig to present her bitter
wormewoode, found such fit opportunity, that Vortymis and she met alone in the
privy Garden, where (as lust by continuance grows into impudency) she
reauealed unto him the sum of her desters: Vortymis, for that custom in
offending, had not yet taken away the f^eling of the fault began to blush, and
whether it were for conscience, or fear, begun with great reasons to persuade
Moedyna from her determined folly. Showing first what an offense adultrie was
to the Gods, how such unlawful Actions did more displease the Heavens then
men, that nuptial faith violated did seldom or never escape without revenge.
He laid before her face that Polumestor was his sovereign, and a king to whom
he was bound by duty and allegeaunce recounting what soundry favors he had
received at his hands, and what vyllanous ingratitude it should be to requite
him with such disloyalty: he told her that Princes are glorious objects to
be gazed at with every eye, that their deeds are even table talk among
beggars: that shame and infamy follows at the heels of unbridled Lust, and
report glories in blazing the mishappe of princes. These and such like
persuasions of Vortymis could not prevail to diswade her from her wicked
resolution, but remaining obstinate in her determination, her fury so ^iered
with rage at this repulse, as it could not be appeased with reason she began
with bitter taunts to take up the gentleman, and to lay before him two baits,
preferment and death, promising if he granted her desiers to be a means for
his advancement to high dignities, and vowing if he rejected her love as
refuse, she would with injury worse then death, requite his scornful
cowardice.

Vortymis s^eing that to persuade Moedyna any more, was but to strive agyinst
the stream (as feawe entreaties serve to lead unto vice) consented as secret
opportunity should give them leave to be her faithful servant and frinde at
command: Moedyna hearing this frindly conclusion of Vortymis, promised in
requital of his grant, that neither tune, nor adverse ^ortune should diminish
her affection, but in that despite of the destinies she should be always
faithful, and thereupon for ^eare of further suspicion, she went into her
chamber, leaving Vortymis in a doubtful dyleman, which he began thus to
discuss with him self.

Too true it is Vortymis that iniust offenses may escape for a time without
anger but never without revenge, that what the gods defer they take not away,
that delay in punishment is no privilege of pardon, fear then Vortymis to
commit that which thou oughtst to fear, if not past all fear: Adultery, yea,
adultery vile wretch^ for thou can not grace the crime with a better couller,
a fault so opposite to the heavens, so contrary to nature, so odious to men,
as the Gods revenge without forgetfulness. Brute beasts by meare instinct of
nature abhor, and men as a fault most impious censure with y^ guerdon of
death. Truth but it is a princess that persuades. A Queen that holds in the
one hand death, and the other dignity: ah Vortymis what then, the higher honor
is s^ated by virtue the deeper is her fall overthrown by vice, the greater the
persons be that offend, the more foul and loathsome is the fault. Base
thoughts as they are odious so they are inconstant, hot l^ue is soon cold,
and faith pighted with an adulterous vow, as it is tied without conscience, so
it is broken without care. Conscience, yea, conscience Vortymis, which is such a
worm that fretteth like the Seres wool: secretly and deeply, easily gotten,
but hardly worn out. What so is rubbed with the stone Galactites will never be
hot. Flesh dipped in the Sea Egenun will never be sweet. The herb Tragion
being once byt with an Aspis never grows, and conscience once stained with
treacherous adultery is always tied to a guilty remorse.

But yet remember Vortymis that folly re^useth gold, and frenzy preferment:
Wisdom seeks after dignity, and counsel after gain: a pound of gold is
worth a Tun of Lead: Great gyfts are little gods, there is nothing sweeter
then promotion, nor lighter then report: care not then for conscience so thou
b^e'st rich, if not chastely yet charely, step not at a straw, but prefer an
ounce of dignity before a scruple of honesty. And with that he staide as half
out of love with his own wicked resolution. For having muttered out these or
such like words, seeing either he must die with a clear mind, or live with a
spotted conscience, he was combred with diverse cogitations, till at last
Fancy growing to be predominant over virtue, he yielded to the Alarumes of
lust, and seeking after opportunity, fo^nde the desiers of both their minds
satisfied: Remaining thus drowned a while in this supposed pleasure, doubting
as fear is the companion to a guilty conscience, that their wickedness should
b^e espied, they determined as secretly and spe^dely as might be to fly out
of Ithaca into Samos, that harboring there unknown, they might end their
delights without disturbance, for they knew if ever (as time is a bad
secretary) their adulterous practices should come to the ears of Polumestor, a
worse mishappe then death should be allotted for their ungrateful mischief,
resolving therefore upon departure least delay might breed danger, and the
grass be cut from under their feet, they severally settled them selves to
their secret endeavors, for Vortymis who was skillful in the depth and dangers
of the Havens, Por^s, and Creekes about Ithaca, provided a bark and laid it
ready as soon as wind and weather would per^^t to make way, for he had
warped it down into the main, and let her ride at Anchor: And Moedyna had
gathered together a mass of Treasure, all her rich and costly Jewels, yea,
whatsoever was any thing precious in the whole Palace, which by a man of hirs
who only she made privy to this practice, was conveyed into the ship: Fortune
willing under the suppose of their felicity to hide the very substance of
their myserie, brought the wind about so fair for Samos that Vo^tymis giving
the Queen intelligence, passing out at a Postern gate they went down to ye
shore, where the Maryners ready with a Cockboate to set them aboorde hoysed
sails, and singling into the main, bad farewell to Ithaca. These two thus
favored as they thought by Fortune had so happy a gale, that in short time
they arrived at the desired harbor, where bountifully rewarding the Maryners
for their pains: the Master of the ship to couller his voyage made for an
other Coaste, and they remaining as strangers, placing them selves in a
country Uyllage lived peaceably a long while unknown. But to return to
Polumestor, who missing his wife, and woondring what the cause should be of
her long absence, for that supper was ready, and they stayed only for her
presence, made inquiry of the Ladies where her Majesty was become, and caused
diligent search to be made, for yt the time of the night was not to make any
longer walk. Her Ladies returned answer, they knew not ^f her departure, y^
king half suspicious before, became now a little Jealous, and demanded where
Vortymis was, no man could tell or make dyrect answer of his being, which set
the king in a fury, so that posting him self, with his Sword drawn through
every privy place, at last not finding what h^e sought for, he was constrained
to use patience perforce at so straight an exig^t, and so quieted him self at
that time, unwilling by an open discovery of his thoughts to breed a manifest
in famy to the Queen: the court being thus in an uproar for this night, ye
next morning one of her maids of honor being stricktlie examined, conf^ssed
that her grace had made conueyaunce of all her Treasure, Jewels, and apparel,
and was secretly departed with Vortymis, but whether she knew not. Upon this
the king sent diverse noble men to make search in every place, and in every
part if it could be known of her passage, but return was made in vain, and
he only rested resolved that she was ^ledde away with Vortymis: Continuing
thus pensive, the grief^ of her absence (for that love in excess yields to
no censure of reason) so ouercharged the king with melancholy, that he fell
into a quartaine Fever, and was brought so low as his subjects hoped for no
life, so that as men distract of their wyts, they passed away the time in
bitter complaints and sorrows. But Time (the sweetest phisit^^n that
allotteth a m^dicine, for ^uerye mishap so alienated the kings mind with a
due consideration of her incestious behavior, that finding it folly to set
that at his heart which other set at their heel: Contrary causes producing
contrary ^ff^cts, love wronged by injury half turned into hate, he began to
take heart at grass, and so changing his m^lancholy into mirth, waxed daily
more strong in the constitution of his body, so that within ye space of a
month he adventured to walk abroad, and to comfort him the more in his
co^ceipt, he heard news by a Passenger that came from Samos wh^re the Que^ne
and Vortymis were: how as man and wife they lived in mean estate in Samos. The
king smiling at the force of (...) lust that makes no exception of Fortun^,
caused the passenger to stay in the Court while he should consider with his
counsel what were ^es^ ^o do: For his mind was dyuersly p^rplexed. The
injury proffred by her adulterours departure, willed him to cast out no lure to
such a hagga^de as would turn tail to a ^ull fist: but love that amidst the
coldest Cinders of hate had smothered up little sparks of forepassed affection,
persuaded him to think no fault so great but might be salued with honest
repentance. Again, he called to mind that the Governor of Samos was his
enemy, who if by any means he should become privy to this fact would not
oneli^ encourage his wife in her wickedness, but as a foe laugh at his mishap;
houering thus in sondrie cogitations, at last thus he resolved with him self
to send a friendly letter to Moedyna that she should return with as much
spe^de as might be to Ithaca, but the better to manifest Polumestors meaning,
as near as I can guess, these were the contents.

Polumestor to Moedyna Health.
TO begin Moedyna with a discourse of thy follies, or my sorrows were but in
p^nning down my thoughts to aggrauate my gre^fes, and in committing such a
chartell to thy view to rub a scarre half healed. Omitting therefore such
needless preambl^s, let me say that love as it is variable, so it is mighty
enforcing his effects without denial: for as by constraint it wrought in thee
a new choice, so it has ti^d me perforce so partially to think of thy
fault, as injury offering no disparagment to affection I have upon thy
r^pentance resolved quite to forgive and forget such folly: Venus has her
charms to inchaunt, fancy is a sorceresse that bewitcheth the senses, every
miss must not breed a mislike, and first offenses they say, crave pardons of
course: I consider Moedyna, the purest glass is most brittle, the finest Lawne
takes the soonest stayne, the highest honor the rediest fall, and the
quickest wit the more easly woonne: others have forerunne thee in the like
fault and have been forgiven, return thou with such resolved repentance, and
I vow before the gods to grant thee like pardon. Let Vortymis remain there
for his punishment in exile, but for that he was thy f^inde, leave him thy
Jewels, that although he live banished, he may live rich. Do this Moedyna
and doubt not, for I write no treachery, and if I should: better were thou die
in Ithaca repentant, then live in Samos dishonest: Farewell and whatsoever thou
do I have forgiven thee, but shall never forget thee.

He whom no injury shall Alienate Polumestor of Ithaca.


THis letter thus ended by the consent of his counsel, he sent it by the
forenam^d messenger to Samos, causing him to be accompanied with two or three
of his nobles disguised, that his command might be wrought with more
efficacy: they having received their charge, apparelled like Marchaun^s,
carrying over some small commodities with them, departed: and as fast as wind
and weather would permit, Came over to Samos, where b^ing safely and sp^edely
arrived, making offer of their chaffer to sale, the ^etter to pass the country
without suspicion: the messenger that brought news first to Polumestor,
leaving the nobles, went him self alone with the letter to the Uyllag^ where
the Queen remained. Coming thither contrary to his expectation, he found
that Time the mother of mutabilitie, had made a strange Metamorphosis since his
last depart^re, for meeting with her servant, who through her inconstancy
grudged at her actions, he did understand that Moedyna misliking of her old
choice, through the tickling desire of a new change, had so cunningly feasted
Vortymis at a Banquet, that closely giving him some impoysoned potion, the n^xt
day he was found dead in his bed, the end of such Adoulterous ingratitude, as
preferring the love of a strompet before the laws of the Gods, run headlong
upon mishap and revenge. His death being passed over with a feawe feigned
tears, as women's eyes shed both sorrow and dissimulation, her mourning month
was scarce ended but she was fallen in love with a gentleman in the same
town, (the supposed cause of Vortymis overthrow) who aiming at her beawty and
riches, two great persuasions to affection, intertayned her with such favors,
that she only thought her content in his company. This notyce by her servant
given to the messenger, som^what amassed him when he entered into the
consideration of the inconstant disposition of Concubins, yet going forward in
his purpose, he found opportunity to deliver her the letter, which when she had
read, and thoroughly construed ou^r the contents: conscience the worm that
galleth with r^morse, pincht her so at the heart with rem^mbrance of her
forepassed life, and shame of ^^r present es^ate, that blushing at her own
thought^s, she burst forth into ^eares hal^e resolved to accept of her
husbands proff^r: But Lust that still kindles a restless heat of desire, had
so drowned her in obstinacy, feared that her husbands promises were but
traynes to reu^nge, shame to re^urn^ into Ithaca from whence so shameless she
had fled with such infamy: all these considered, mad^ her oppose r^solution to
r^mors^ and to cast the letter presently into the fire, with straight command
to the Messenger that he should with as much speed and secrecy as might be
have him out of Samos, least if by his means her calling or estate were
discovered, in revenge she repaied his villainy with death: He that by other
men's harms, thought best to beware, fearing if he made any stay, he might
with Vortymis taste of revenge, as fast as horse would carry him, posted to the
noble men, who amid^t their marchaundize were attending his coming: after he
had discoursed unto them from point ^o point, the forerehearsed premises of
ye impoysonement of Vortymis, her new love, her obstinate resolution, her
threats to reueng all of them: woondring at the wilfulness, and wickedness of
such a Lascivious woman: thought their king happy that Fortune by ill fortune,
had at hazard given him such good fortune. Long had they not stayed in the
country to have a fair wynd for their departure, but that Moedynaes Servant
seeking to find out the messenger, was by mere chance come to the Port where
the nobles were, who seeing a Lord of Ithaca, whom for all his disguised
apparel he knew, calling him a side, was desirous to speak with him. The
noble man narrowly noting his face, called him to remembrance, and desirous to
hear what news, he carried him to his chamber, where the rest of his company
gathered together, the poor man suppressed with anguishe and remorse, brast
forth into tears, and after long repentant style for the sorrow of his fact,
told them that the next night after she received the letter from Polumestor,
being all blubbred with tears, and as a woman in despair, she delivered him a
Scroule which she charged him upon his life to deliver unto Polumestor, after
receipt whereof, before he could make preparation for his Journey, she had
slain her self. The noble men se^ing by the sequel of this tragical
stratageeme, the guerdon of Adultry, and the Justice of the gods, received the
Scrowle, and would have had the man passed with them into Ithaca, but he made
a vow in penance of his former fault, to live a poor exiled life in Samos:
they as soon as the wind came about, having all things necessary aboorde,
they made way home into their own country: no sooner they were got into the
coast of Ithaca, but posting with all speed to the court, they revealed to
the king the success they had in their journey, of Vortymus mishap, and his
wives death, delyuering him the Scrowle, which contained these few lines.

The contents of the Scrowle.
MOedyna, once the unhappy wife of happy Polumestor, as graceless in her
deeds, as he princely in his thoughts, wishes him that she rest from her
self a long and contented life. Wisdom taught by experience (the dearest
price to buie wit) told me my fault was so impious, as despair served
better to call on revenge, then repentance to wish a remorse: Infamy and shame
the inseparable sequels of Adultrie, forbad me to see the smoke of Ithaca,
for that death is more sweet then discredit. A guilty conscience being a hell
of restless passions, wished me as I sought mishap, so to end misery,
preferring therefor thy fame which was impaired by my folly, and seeking
quiet of mind by quickness of death, despair, and sorrow, closing min^ eyes,
let the messenger report how willingly I died.

Mo^dyna,


POlumestor having red the ^ontents, perceiving how shame and remorse had made
her repentant, grieuing that despair had made her so wilful, burst into
tears and passed a week or two in secret sorrows: Which ended, and he
somewhat comforted, he kept a solemn show of her funerals, which performed
with magnificence, he passed the rest of his years in quiet.

Ulysses having ended his tale with a plawsible silence of both parts.
Although Hector perceived that this Tragical history was induced in hope of a
restitution of Helena, yet dissimuling the matter, he only gave praise to
Ulysses for his good method, yet superficially glauncing, he said, that i^
ill fitted a subject to be so treacherous, since his Soueraygne had kindly tied
him with so many forepassed favors, and that ingratitude challenges by
custom revenge. Then (quoth Diomedes) let not Paris hope to escape without
peril, who being so princely intertayned by Menelaus, yet repayed him with
such discourteous unthankfulness. What needs (quoth Troilus) the rubbing of
this scarre, unless the Gretians be fearful to end their attempt, and had
rather make a conquest of us with Philosophy, then the sword: for our parts,
we hold it the point of Soldiers to talk pleasantly at the Table, and fight
valiauntly in the ^ielde. Agamemnon unwilling any chollerick replies should
procure a jar, knowing in terms to injury men unarmed were a president of
cowardice, desired them to grant him this fauour^ as they were knights, that
amiddest all their talk, neither the plaintiff Menelaus, nor the Defendant
Paris should be once named, since the rehersall of their actions were but an
alarm to further quarrel. This request thought honorable, and promise past on
both parts, Achilles was warned that the Tables were covered for Supper,
whereupon, desiring the General to place his guests, they sat down to supper,
where passing the time with many pleasant discourses, and sa^i^fiyng their
stomachs with sundry delicates. The Trojans by their intertaynment perceived
their princely welcome.

The second discourse after Supper.
SUpper was no sooner ended. But after a hearty prouface changed betwixt them:
Aged Ne^^or, whose words in ^re^ce were holden for principles, began to break
silence in ^his manner.

Worthy Pears of Greece and Asia, resolved to prove inward virtue by outward
valor, or else to buy fame with death: since Hector and Achilles, the two
hopeful Gentlemen of both armies, accompanied with sundry princes of great
parentage, are here united in a desired presence, omitting women's prattle, and
leaving the Ladies to their pryuate chatte: let us see if we can make a
perfect descrip^ion of a Soldier so proportioned in every part, as h^e may
directing his course by our principles, live fortunate, and dye honorably. The
doubt then to be discusse^ is what is necessary to the perfecting of a
Soldier, which might I with his favor request, I would commit to the charge
of Hector: as to him who of his very enemies is counted an exact martialist.
Hector, whose thoughts swelling with honor, died his cheeks with the fame of
his praise, willing to avoid with one blast, both self love and curiosity,
made Nestor this answer.

Although forrayne favors, are domestical treasures, and it better fitteth
honor, to praise an enemy, then a friend: yet to offer incense to Pallas in the
Temple of Mars, were to profane his deity: and to make me an instance,
Achilles in presence, is to iniure his dignity: report is partial, and the tip
of the tongue sounds not always the depth of the heart: but let fame fly how
she list: I deny not but I have dared to bear armor, and to have pressed
amidst the thickest of mine enimyes, therefore I think the most requisite
virtue in a Soldier, to be fortytude or magnanimity. I think it necessary
(quoth Achilles) as Causa sine qua non: for therefore is he called Siles, for
that he does, Animam fortem gerere: but yet the couller that gives the
sweetest gloss to honor, in my opinion is Liberality: two necessary virtues
(quoth Helenus) but yet a more principal point then these, which has made
many Monarchs triumph without blood, is Wisdom joined with Science.
Agamemnon desirous to hear these three discussed at large, thought to
encourage them forward in this manner. With so equal a proportion (worthy
Gentlemen) have you made a distinct division of the incident properties of
Soldiers, as what is necessary not only in martial discipline, but in
human life, is sufficiently in these three comprehended. For wisdom mixed
with learning and knowledge, is so precious a virtue in the life of man, as it
behooves not only a prince to have the possession thereof, for the policy of
his civil government, but also to the performing of his warlike endeavors:
Fortitude the fairest blossom that springes from a noble mind, is not only
requisite in peace to bew^^y majesty, but in wars necessary to s^^engthen
policy, and were a prince indewed with both these, so as no defect might be
objected, yet were he a covetous man that aimed at the suppression of his
Subjects by extorting their substance by grievous imposts, the want of
Liberality, especially amongst Soldiers, would breed such a mislike, that he
should reap more discredit by his niggardies, then fame for his wisdom and
fortune. Seeing then worthy Gretians and Trojans, these three points as
presidents are set down to be decyded: let us first begin with the discourse
of wisdom, which we will refer to Helenus and Nestor, as to them which we
know are most famous for those qualyties: in both our armies exception always
made of Vlis^es, for that he has so well plaide his part amongst the Ladies.
Helenus bl^shing at the grant of this honorable charge, desired that since
Nestor was aged, and had by long art amongst the Philosophers, and by
experience in cyuill government, attained to the summary perfection of
wisdom, that he would ^ase him of such a burden as was both unfit for his
knowledge, experience and years: Nestor, as willing amongst such an audience,
to put the Trojan to the plunge, said that Age was forgetful, and that his
gray hairs were decli^ing steps from memory^ that what experience had
engraven, time had almost worn out, and that were his memory never so fre^h,
yet it were a grief for him, through feebleness to utter that with the tongue
which he did conceive in his mind: therefore, for the reverence of his age
he would lay the charge upon Helenus: who seeing that fortune had tied him to
his task gathering his wits together bouldly, as one that was the brother of
Hector, began on this manner.

Helenus his discourse of Wisdom.
THe fall that Phaeton had, was because he would Altum sapere, stretched his
stringes to high, and being mortal would intermeddle with divine attempts. The
Shoemaker had not this check from Apelles (Ne suitor vltra Crepidam) because he
found fault with the Latchet, but that he meddled with the leg. Every one that
gazeth at the stars is not fit to discourse of Astrology, neither can
fishermen fell the Phusicall reasons of the motions of the Sea. Although their
lives are spent, and their lyuings got, from the boosome of Neptune. And noble
Gentlemen, it may be that report, who is often a false Heralte of human
Actions, has blabbed that she has seen some Philosophers works in my hands,
and you hereof suppose that I have their principles in my head: but many
handled Orpheus Harp that knew not the secrets of Music, and diverse may gase
into Philosophers conclusions that cannot Analuze their reasons. Yet howsoever
it be, seeing I am enjoined I will rather be counted too forward then too
froward, and therefore bri^fly, this is my bare censure.

The Philosopher whom Apollos Oracle long since graced with the title of a wise
man, being demanded what wisdom was, made answer: A divine influence
infused into the minds of men, which being metaphysicall^ keeps them from
comm^^^^g that whereunto they are forced by sensual appetyte. Epictetus
calls it the touchstone of mortallity, meaning, that as reason is the
difference that distinguishes a man from a brut^ beast, so wisdom is that
perfect under, that shows how far one man excels an other in the
precious constitution of his mind. Therefore did our Poets rightly feign
Mynerua to spring from the ^rayne of Jupiter, and that he durst do nothing
without her consent but his loves and amorous, meaning by this E^^gmaticall
allegory, that she being the godd^ss^ of wisdom, was the Loadstone for
Jupiter to dyrect his actions, and where he digressed, there she sealed his
thoughts with a frown.

The Phenicians were reported to have their beginning from the gods^ in that
they were the first that found out C^racters, whereby to express openly the
hidden secrets of wisdom. The inhabytants of Egypt, as fame tells us, were
honored of all men, since they were the first that founded Schools of
Philosophy. And the Caldees were companions to kings: so highly has wisdom
been esteemed in all ages. But to leave antiquities, and to come to our
present time, what avails royal Parentage, and the possession of many
Territories: what profits a Crown and stately Diadem to the majesty of a
king: if to these forenamed favors of Fortune he have not adjoined wisdom
and learning, the cyuill pollycie is not mayntained in his prime: martial
discipline wants her chiefest collou^: courage is counted rashness, not
fortitude: liberality knows not the circumstances how to give, if wisdom
bend not their course by a right compass: so that I remember a certain
Philosopher of yours, wishing ill fortune might befall on the inhabitants of
Samos, he prayed only their king might be unlettered, and a fool, thinking
no greater prejudice could happen to a common wealth, then to be governed by
an unwise prince. But omitting this general discourse of wisdom, since there
is none so obstynate or opposite to her honor: but will and must confess that
no human action whatsoever can rightly be counted perfect or virtuous: if
not bounded within the lymits of wisdom. To a more particular proof, and to
the intent of our purpose^ that it is especially requisite in a Soldier.

A Gretian being demanded how it happened that his country flourished in such
happy estate, made answer, for that our Captains and Generals are
Philosophers, and our Philosophers made our Captains in war: proouing by
this reason, that where the martial man was instructed in philosophy, there
prowess was strengthened with policy, and valor ^^doubled by wisdom: the
Senate of Sparta never choose any to go forth with their army, but such as
had spent many years in their academy, as well in natural contemplation as in
moral conversation, and were as eloquent an Orator, as a hardy warrior,
counting encouragement given by wisdom, of as great force as a president
manifested by prow^sse. When Esthemius the Macedonian Monarche, successor to
the offspring of mighty Nymroth had thought to make a conquest of the southeast
part of the World: by chance he made war with a Barbarous people, so
fierce and strong as his forces could not subdue: Delyghted with the
sweetness of the soil, and s^eing prowess was in vain, he sent an Orator
clad in rich and sumptuous attire, who so tickled their ears with the
pleasantness of his speech, that he reduced the Barbarians, not only to
submit as vanquished, but to become civil as ashamed of their former life: How
necessary the knowledge of the lyberall Sciences is for a Soldier, let
experience manifest: for what captain shall be able to make choice of his
ground to fight with his enemy to entrench to imbattayle, to leguer, to pitch
his Pauilions at advantage, unless skillful in Geography, to know the Nature
and plott of the Country so lately discouered^ How shall he order his men, or
divide them in companyes: how shall he bring them into square, round,
triangle, corner or any other form, unless instructed in Arithmetike and
Geometry. The necessity of Astronomy may be proved by a manifest instance:
for Penthesilea the famous Queen of the Amazons, was resident in the city of
Troy, making war against Orythius her bordering enemy: as the battayles were
ready to join, there chanced in their fight to happen an Eclipse of the Sun
most fearful and terrible, which greatly daunted both armies: but Penthesile^
nothing amazed, as a good Philosopher discoursed to her Ladies the natural
cause of the Eclypse, that it happened by the shadowing of the Earth; and the
Moon, which so lightly accounted of, by their General they encouraged, set
upon Orythius, who ignorant of so strange a sight, and not knowing the cause of
so prodigious an appearance, fled^ and was vanquished: Sapiens dominabitur
astris^ a wise man may govern the stars, meaning hereby (as I conjecture)
that if Fate and Fortune, should oppose them selves to wisdom, yet their
attempt were in vain: therefore wisely did the Poets decipher Pallas to have a
Helmet on her head, and a Book in her hand, and drew her Spears always
wreathed with Laurel, signifying by this Emblem, that Mars and Mercury were
of one brood, that a ^alyaunt mind, unless guyded by wisdom, rometh into
many inconsidered actions, which is so perilous in the state of a soldier,
that one foolish thought that bears in the foreheade, ( Had I wist) makes an
overthrow of a whole Legion of men. We find written in our Annalles of Troy,
that Danaus the Graundfather of Pryamus making war against the king of
Hetruria when both the armies were encamped, and the battayles ready to Join
his men, seeing so great a multitude were afraid, although their prince
foremost in the field, sought to encourage them by the example of his valor,
his forwardness nor threats no whit prevailing, but they still ready to flee:
Apias a lame and impotent Poet stepping up amongst them, through certain
eloquent verses, that he uttered in every rank so animated the Soldiers,
that ashamed at their cowardis^, they furiou^ly ran upon the enemy, and like
valiant men obtained the victory, so much does learning and wisdom prevail
in martial discipline.

I remember in deed (quoth Nestor) that I have heard in the ancient Records
of Greece, kept in the temple of Apollo at Delphos: that ye God being demanded
the reason why Jupiter should be Governor above the rest, since Mars was the
best warrior: his answer was, that as Mars was valiant, so Jupiter was wise,
concluding by this oracle, that wisdom is of more force to subdue, then
valor. And by your leave sir (quoth Helenus) it is a question, what prowess
does avail without wisdom: for suppose the captain has courage enough to
brave the enemy in the face, yet if he know not by a wise and deep i^^^^ht
into his enemies thoughts, how with advantage to pr^^^^t such ambushes as may
be laid to prejudice his army, had he as great courage as the stowtest
champion in the world, yet might the defect of wisdom in the prevention of
such perils, ruinate both him self, his honor, and his Soldiers, in so much
as your great Philosopher Hermes Tresmegistus, was wont to say that wise men
did therein resemble the Gods, in that they were wise, and that many things
imperfect by nature, were made perfect by wisdom, to confirm their force,
where of may it please the Gretian Lords to favor me with patience, I will
rehearse a pleasant tragedy. The noble men delighted with the sweetness of his
discourse, by settling them selves to silence, gave a proof how they meant to
be attentive, which Helenus noting, began his tale in this form.

Helenus his Tragedy. Ex sapientia sumus prouidi.
THere raygned not long since in the Country of Lydia a worthy Prince,
called Ebritius, who being happy as one favored with the fruition of exterior
pleasures, and fortunate, as by a plawsible success in all his affairs,
enjoying an inward content: yet in this was crossed by the destinies, that he
wanted a son to wear the Diadem after his death: only one daughter he had (a
recompense that Nature had given to salve the defect that Fate and fortune had
inserted) who b^ing beawtifull, and therefore feared of her father, since often
beawty is the fairest mark that leads to mishappe, and of excellent wit, a
benefit that sometime is tasted with loss, had for her sundry good qualities
wherewith she was graced, diverse Suitors (princes I mean) that were his
bordering neighbors, sent thither by fame, to see if her beawty and wit were
answerable to that which report had blazed to be without comparison: amongst
the rest Rascianus king of Caspia, a man greatly feared for his valor and
prowess, not that he him self was so hardy, but that his Generals and
Captains were of such courage, as they never entered field from whence they
returned not Uictors: a League of Truce having long continued betwixt them, and
yet with a dissimuled reconciliation: since the Caspians and the Lydians were
like the Woolfe and the Tigre, whose blood can never be mixed in one house. It
fortuned that Rascianus under the protection of his league, and intent to visit
Ebritius, had a sight of Cimbriana, for so was the Lady called whose beawty
seemed so sweet an object in his eyes, and whose wit sounded such a pleasing
harmony in his ears, that forgetting him self, he suffered his thoughts to
be subdued by affection, that never before felt the fo^le ^f any conquest: For
Love seeing that Fortune, either for fear or favor, as the goddess is both
partial and deceiptfull, had drowned him with such variety of sec^re
contents, as he was grown to be an epicure in conceit: thought at last to
show that Fancy has her ^rownes as well as Fortune, and can either bliss with
happiness, or curse with disfavor at her own pleasure: so fettered his mind
with the perfection of Cimbriana, that maugre his teeth, he was feign to
sacrifice his dearest good to Cupid, that hitherto had scorned to offer a
little incense to Mars: the passions dryuing the prince to become pensive, and
the Idea of Cimbria^aes beauty imprinted in his heart, breeding a disquiet in
his mind so perplexed him, that for his last refuge he was feign to commence
suit to Ebritius, for the grant of his daughter in marriage: He that like
Ianus, bare two faces under one hoode: wearing a Laurel in his hand, as
desirous of peace: and a sword in his heart, as wishing reueng: as he would
not deny for fear of a quarrel, so he would not grant to such hated
affinity, but having forewarned his daughter, and therefore forearmed her
against the entreaties of the Caspian Monarche, he subtelly referred his grant
to the will of Cimbriana: which being sought for of Rascianus, but found by a
frivolous suit that he warred with the Giants against Jupiter, and with Danaes
daughters filled the bottomless tubbe: forced by affection, (that is)
impatient of denial, and encouraged by the valor of his Captains (a thought
that brooketh not abuse) falling out in flat terms with Ebritius he entered
after some parle with him and his daughter into this peremptory r^solution,
that if he could not have her by a favorable consent as a frinde, he would
both win her and wear her as an enemy by the sword: and upon this departed
out of the confines of Lydia, and no sooner came to Caspia, but mustering his
men, and storing him self with munition for the wars, he marched forward
to make challeng of Cimbriana for his wife. In the mean time Ebritius having
lived long in peace, a word that bears honney in the mouth, and yet often ill
hap in the war, for that as it affoordeth quiet, so it sincketh in
security, had better Ciuilians, then Soldiers, and Senators that could
govern more by policy, then attempt by prowess, as men that so long had
forgotten the noise of the Trumpet, as they counted it rather a trouble to the
care then an encouragement to the heart: so that he ^eared when report told
him that Rascianus was near his Domynions, to make a challeng both for his
Daughter and Dyadem: yet Majesty, which in princely thoughts gardeth ye mind
from cowardice, made him resolute rather to die honorably by withstanding an
enemy, then to live tainted with a shameful stayne of disgrace: resting upon
this resolute point, before Rascianus came within his territories, he fell
sick upon such a mortal disease as feeling no hope of life, calling his
Daughter Cimbriana, and his Senators before him with tears bewailed the
suspected loss of their prince as his last farewell he gave these precepts.

Cimbriana, thou see my white hairs are blossoms for the grave, and thy
fresh coullers fruit for time and fortune so that it behooves me to think
how to die, and for thee to care how to live. Sickness and old age, the two
Crooches whereon life walks on to death, have arested me to pay Nature her
due, which being debt I am most willing to discharge: my Crown I must leave
appointed so by fate, and thou enjoy my kingdom by succession, wherein I hope
thy virtue and wisdom shall be such, as though my subjects want my person, yet
they shall see in thee my perfection. That nothing therefore may fail to
satisfy my mind, or increase thy dignities, hear what age and experience has
taught me, that thy youth is not yet able to conceive. Know Daughter that
oportunities neglected are signs of folly, whereas actions measured by time
are seldom bitten with repentance, honor is fickle, a sweet seat, but a
^lippery passage, no sooner grown to a faier blossom, but fame enforced by
envy seeks to blast it with the black and dismal Trumpet of report: A
Crown, Cimbriana, yea Cimbriana, a Crown, a thing that all desire, feawe
obtain: and most account it once gotten, a weary and grievous burden, is so
sugared and pleasing an object to the eye, as it makes men by ambition to
forget they are men, and to think them selves more then gods: thou shall have a
Crown, but be not proud; majesty is no privilege to contempt; thy glory is
great, but thy care is more; if thou meanest to live be loved and die honored:
self love is not fit for princes, nor pride an ornament to a Dyadem: but if
thou must be tickled with self conceit, let it be, Cimbriana, at the
remembrance of thy virtues, not thy dignities; least if Fortune f^owne, and
thou should hap to fall, to be envied, not pitied: when my body is closed
in the grave, thy head impal^ed with a Crown, think thou art a woman and a
maid, though a Queen and a princess, therefore be mild as becoming thy
Sex, and chaste as fi^ting thine honor: Let the Senators be thy fathers, and
the laws the directors of thy thoughts, least perverting law by will, thy
Subjects count thy government foolish, and ^ff^^ynate tyranny: take heed
Cimbriana of Love: thy years being fruit for fancy: kings seats are high
marks, whereat Cupid can aim, be he never so blind: the feet of princes
have Caeres and Bacchus for their footestooles, then cannot it be but Venus
must play the wanton in their Palaces, but if affection, as women must love,
for that they are women, hap to tread upon thy heel, then sweet Cimbriana
choose flowers, not weeds: thou art a princess, look no lower then
Majesty: thou have a Crown, then gase not after riches but virtues: tie not
thy self to a mean person, for Venus is painted in silks not in rags, and
Cupid treads on disdain when he reaches at dignity: but above all (
Cimbriana) take heed of Rascianus a reconciled enemy, him account as thy
supposed frinde and thy fathers foe: what he cannot persuade with words, he
seeks to constrayne with weapons, but rather die then consent, so shall my
departing breath breathe out nothing upon thee but bliss: and with that before
he could end the sentence, he gave a gasp and yielded up the ghost:
Cimbriana seeing her fathers liuelesse body almost between her arms: melting
into tears, burst forth into such lamentable complaints, that her Ladies
carrying her away in apace, and the sorrowful Senators and Peers of Lydia
amazed at the sudden death of their prince departed: nothing sounded in the
palace but sighs and tears, no house in the City not filled with
mourninges, in such sort, that a long while the people ran as men bereft of
their wits up and down the streets, forgetful of their pryuate and necessary
business: but time that limiteth an end to the greatest sorrows, ^aused
Cimbriana after consideration how Nature claymed but his, to take order for
the precious balming of her fathers corpse, and for the magnificence of his
Funerals, which she performed in such sumptuous sort, as might bewray her
duetifull affection, and her fathers princely Progeny: Fortune seeing the Lady
not greatly checked with this mate, thought to sport himself in the tragical
mishappe of this young princess. For the funeral ended and she by will of
the Senators going to her Coronation, the solemnity thereof was scarcely
finished, before word was brought her that Rascianus with a multitude of his
Caspians, had placed a monstrous and strong Legar about the City. Cimbriana
willing to spite Fortune with patience, made no answer, as one not caring
what the enemy could do by force, and as resolved by her fathers command
rat^er to die then consent, committing therefore the guard of the city to the
charge of the Senators she remained quiet and secure in her chamber. But the
Senators whose heads though not armed with helmet^, yet stored with polliticke
foresight of their enemies endeavors, caused the gates to be shut up, the
Percullyzes to be let down, the walls to be countermured with rampires of
forces, and every quarter of the city to be guarded with several companies,
both of Captains and Soldiers fit for such a charge. Rascianus seeing how ye
Cytizens prepared them selves to defense, scorning to bear the brave of such a
paltry town, yet willing to win the Lady^ rather by entreaty, then by force,
sent a Heralt of Arms, who frindly let into the gates and admitted to
Cimbrians presence, he delivered his message from Rascianus in this manner.

The mighty prince of Caspia sends greeting to Cimbriana the famous Queen
of the Lydians, letting her to understand that he is Copartner with her of
sorrows, as he would be of affections, greeuing at her fathers loss,
especially growing so to her mislike, but since Fate and necessity may not be
auoided^ he wishes the princess to comfort her self in her greefes, and not
to be amassed that he comes as an enemy denouncing wars, since he holds
both fire and water in his hands, both death and life, upon frindly conditions;
namely if Cimbriana yield her self as his wife, her Crown and kingdom into
his hand, the Citizens in joy of the marriage shall fill their bellies with
feasts, their ears with music: and with sollemnitie, have their heads
decked with garlands of Laurel: but if she deny, his love being changed into
hate, Cimbriana shall live the Concubyne of Rascianus in contempt, the Senators
graye heads shall go untimely to the grave, the children shall be slain, and
the citizens have no refuge but the swoorde, nor no pardon but death.

Before the Heralt could end his charge, Cimbriana not bearing the
presumptuous brave of such a tyrant, returned him this brief answer: For that
heralt Messengers carry privileges in their foreheads, to free them from any
foreign prejudice, I hear with patience what thou have in charge, but
unwilling to be further privy to his frivolous threats, say thus from me to
Rascianus: That Cimbriana having tears in her eyes, and sighs from her heart
for her fathers death, has no place left to grieve at the daring terms of any
tyrant, that she scorneth his proffer or friendship, as a prince unworthy her
majesty, much less her love: that her Senators and Cytizens think they are as
politic as he is valiant, and are as able to defend as he to assault:
therefore will the proud prince to do his worst, for he cannot affright them
with death that fear not death: and with that she turned her back, leaving
the Messenger amazed at an answer so full of majesty. The Senators conducting
him out of the City with a frindly farewell, suffered him to depart: who
returning to the king told him the resol^^e reply of the pryncesse, which
perplexed Rascianus with a double passion, for as he was environed with the
courage of such a peerless Queen as preferred majesty and honor before
death, so he was grieved that she was so obstinate as to give him the repulse
of such a sweet and desired bene^it, reueng crying to take leave of affection,
so hardened his heart, that swearing never to entreat again, he presently
commanded his General (called Mandauior) a man of invincible courage and
valor, to give a fierce and furious assault to the Cyt^^, since the cowards had
so fearfully harbored them selves within the walls: He whom nothing better
pleased then the command of martial attempts, presently upon this charge,
gathering his men at arms together, fitted with their scaling Lathers and
other munition, Mandauior foremost, as one full of courage, began so valyantly
to give an assault, as had not the citiz^ns made as violent an intermedley, by
throwing down not Pytch, Timber, and s^ones from of the walls, the City ^ad
been s^aled and s^cke^: but such a hot resistance wa^ made that the Caspians
^^ed from the walls: but Mandauior with the example of his fortitude, and the
threats of reueng upon the cowards, he so encouraged them, that a fresh they
assaulted, but with such great slaughter, that despite of him self the
General was feign to sound retraite, and with some loss r^tyre to the camp.
This repulse nothing amazing them, they assayed sundry times to indammage the
town, but all in vain, which so grieved Mandauior, that impatient of fortunes
frown, he so desperately at the next assault offered to climb the wall that
he was slain, and his men beaten back with great effusion of blood: Mandauior
dead, Rascianus appointed in his room one Prelides, a man far more liberal
then the other was valiant, who promising to perform that by prodigal
expenses, that Mandauior missed of by his valiant endeavors, told his Lord
that there was no City so strong, whereinto an ass laden with gold could
not enter: that great gifts were little gods, that p^lfe has such force to
persuade, as Auri Sacra fames: quid non mortalia pectora cogit? men have their
thoughts and their passions: and so great a conflict is there between a
lyberall Purse and a covetous, that might it please his majesty to grant him
the distributing of his Treasures, he pawned his life for the speedy recovery
of the city: the king desir^us to hazard him self for the hope of revenge,
gave him free use of all his coin, which once in possession of Prelides, he
began first to pay al his Soldiers wages, the greatest encouragement that may
be given to a free mind, and to bestow bountifully of every mean man beyond
his de^ert, with promise, that if they sacked the City the spoil should be
equally divided amongst them, the king only craving for his share the princess
Cimbriana, with Crown and kingdom: this persuasion alleged, and his
Soldiers hearts ^et on fire with hope of gain, the next morning by break of
the day, he made an assault with such force, as ^he cytizens never felt
before: but they poor men ^^ghting no^ for gold, but for their lives and
family, so hardely abid the brunte, that Prelides was feign to retire wit ^
great ^ishonor: His purpose not fitted by this pretense, secretly he got to
speak with one of the Senators, to whom he promised two Talents of gold that
the City might be delivered: The Lydians being more politic then he was
prodigal, after a faint denial gave consent, and confirmed it with an oath,
that for such a sum he would deliver up the City, the agreement ended, and
appointed, Prelides carrying his gold, met according to promise, the Senator,
who receiving him and his money with a great troop of Soldiers, brought them
within an ambush, an^ made such a bloody massacre of them all, as there was not
one left to bear dismal report of such merciless butchery: yet the triumph
made in the City, their heads set over the walls, and the Caspians
Auntientes displayed on the Turrettes of the City, gave Rascianus to
understand what ill fortune had fallen to his general Prelides. This mishap
still increasing the fury of the Caspian, called him so fast on to revenge,
that now intending to loose in one day both his men and him self,
understanding that the citizens were greatly weakened, and also weary of their
war and of the si^ge, he resolved in person to give the assault: but
Cleophanes a noble man in the Camp, whose wisdom excelled either the
fortitude, or liberallity of the other, noting with a deep insight the sundry
accidents, and seeing that the Senators were more wise then valiant, and
defended the City better by wisdom then they could do with policy, he
thought to give them a soppe of the same sauce, and to thrust out one wyle with
another, therefore he desired of his Sovereign that he would suffer him to
overthrow that with his head, that his whole host could not once shake with
their hands, the king knowing him to be of great experience, not only
granted his request, but added a promise of higher dignity if he ^ulfilled
his desire: whereupon he willed the king to crave a Truce for ten days, which
being granted, during the time of the league it was lawful for any Caspian to
go into the City, and for any Citizen to visit the Camp: this interchaunge
of frindship confirmed, Rascianus by the counsel of Cleophanes sent four and
twenty of his chief nobles, and chiefetaines into the City, as pledges, that
the Senators might come safely into the Camp without prejudice, so to parle of
the peace with the king: this request thought necessary by Cimbriana and her
Counsel, the Senators came, in whose residence at the Camp, Cleophanes going
into the City and into the market place, gathering a multitude of the rude and
common sort together, he subtelly began to insinuate into their minds, with
this pleasing Oration.

Cleophanes Oration to the Citizens.
Worthy Cytizens and inhabitants of Lydia whose forepassed peace, darkened with
a mortal and resolute war, and whose long happiness quaketh at the thought
of incident myseries, I cannot, though an enemy, yet pass the streets without
plaintes, nor though sworn ^o your fatal ruin, yet foresee your fall without
tears: has this city been famous for her walls, her Turrets, and stately
edifices, bewrayed a pomp to the eye by her sumptuous buildinges, and shall it
be laid waste as a desolate place, so that strangers shall ask: where
stood the glorious City of Lydia? Shall so many men as are here present,
whose years are young enough, many days hence to pass with quiet into the
grave, perish at the City walls with the swoorde? shall these sweet women,
whose angels faces plead for pity, be led as sorrowful wydowes into
captivity? shall the little babes and tender infantes be taken from the T^ate,
and lie stra^gled in the streets? shall the virgins, whose chastity is so
precious, be a pray to the soldier, and be deflowred before the face of their
paren^s? Nay forgetful Cytizens of Lydia, shall fire and swoorde without mercy
finish what I forewarne: and you so senseless as to believe the doting Senators
that feed you with hope of our remove? Has not the mighty Caspian compassed
the City with such an host, and your liberty is no further then the limits of
your walls: yea, and has he not sworn to continue the siege till he be
king, and invested with the Crown? consider what he craves, nothing but to
have the Queen to his wife, and you to continue his true and lawful
Subi^ctes, he seeks not your lives, your goods, your overthrow, but to be as
sovereign and protector of so fair a city, and so honest Citizens: what
madness then (this requ^st so reasonable) has incensed your Senators to
resist him, whom fortune has in far more dangerous attempts sent away with
conquest. Believe me Cytizens^ it is the fear of their wealth, not the care
of your welfare; the dread of their own mishap, not ye desire of your goods
that drives them to make slaughter of the Citizens without reason: seeing then
you are forewarned, be forearmed, provide for your own safty, suffer the king
to come in, and I my self will remain here among you as a pledge of your
safty.

At these words, the unbridled multitude desirous of nouelty: as men in a
fury ran to the palace, thinking by force to have carried the Queen to the
Tent of Rascianus: But she having notice of their intent, secretly fled out of
the palace, and conveyed her into one of the Senators houses adjoining: the
Cytizens not finding her majesty, fell to spoil of the treasures, which done,
setting open the gates, they getting Branches of Laurel in their hands, went
to the Pauilion of Rascianus, where seeing the Senators talking for the estate
of their common wealth, after certain complaints uttered against them, they
delivered up the keys of the City into the kings hand: He taking opportunity
at the rebounde, casting a frowning look upon the Senators, and with a
submisse courtesy and a frindly oration of welcome, intertaining the Citizens,
he presently departed, and with all his host was received into the City: no
sooner had Rascianus possessed him self of the town, and his pledges come into
his presence, but by the persuasion of Cleophanes he put all the Senators and
chief of the City to the edge of the sword, giving the rest of the City as a
pray to his soldiers: then they which were by the pleasinge Harmony of his
forerehearsed oration deluded, seeing themselves brought into extreme misery,
found that the pollitike wisdom of Cleophanes had more ruinated their estate
then all the former forces of Mandauior or Prelides: Well, repentan^e coming
too late, the Senators slain, the Cittye sacked and all brought to ruin: yet
had not the king his purpose, for Cimbriana was missing, and could by no
means be found, so that the Caspian raging in the heat of his affection,
having made a privy search and all in vain: was driven again ^or his last
refuge to the policy of Cleophanes, who counsayled his majesty to assemble
all the women, of what age or Degree so ever into the palace, and afterward to
sel^ct out all the aged Matrons or others whatsoever, above the age of twenty,
and under the years of LX. which done, that the rest might be appointed to
dance. The king following the counsel of Cleophanes, assembled them all, and
sorted them: now amongst the maids was left Cimbriana in disguised apparel,
who falling to the lot of one of the mean soldiers, as soon as the music
founded, and they began to tread the measures, could not so well dissemble,
but there appeared in her gestures such a majesty, as every eye might easily
judge her to be some extraordinary person: herevppon Rascianus licensing all
to depart, seized him self upon Cimbriana, who seeing fortune would not let
her escape her determined ill fortune, without fear confessed she was
daughter to ^britius, and right possessor of that Crown which he did
wrongfully usurp. The king seeking by laying down the sum of her miseries,
to make her more submisse, so prevailed, that two or three days passed in
sorrows, he found her as tractable as he could desire, and upon her
frindly and loving consent, resolved to solempnise the marriage, and so to
become peaceable possessor of her and her kingdom: resting upon this
resolution, while all things were preparing for such a sumptuous feast,
Cimbriana accompanied with her Ladies, finding that none but they and her self
were present, falling into sighs, and from sighs to tears, burst at last
into these terms.

Honorable Ladies of Lydia, renowned through the world for your beauties and
virtues, whose youth has been crossed by fortune, and whose age is assigned
to misery, deprived of your husbands, your parents, your children, your wealth,
your liberty: yea, and in hazard of daily dishonor by the Caspians, the
greatest loss of all. Whetherto do we look but to shame and mishap? to what
end do we live but to disgrace and infamy? has our frinds made defense of
our safty with their lives, and shall we enter league with their enemies after
death? shall the hand that slaughtred your parents be thrust freely into your
Iuory bosoms? shall he intertaine you with amors, through whom our city
perished in armours? No Ladies, let the sight of their carcases yet unburied
hale us on to revenge: let us prefer death before dishonor, let us choose
rather to accompany our frinds in their fortunes, then sport in our enemies
favors: better is a moment of grief then a wo^ld of myserie: I se^ke not to
persuade wherein I will not my self be foremost: let the Tragedy be resolved
on, and I will be first actor to bathe my hands in blood: to bring which to
pass^, at the marriage, midst our mirth, and in the thickest of our cups let
every Lady choose a Lord, into whose cup let her put a dram of this deadly
poison, and so drinking the half, purchase an honorable death with revenge.
The Ladies freely consenting to this motion, Cimbriana gave secret notice to
such Cytizens as were left, hat when ye city should be in an vproare for the
death of Rascianus, ready in armor, they would set upon the sorrowful
soldiers, and put all to the edge of the sword. This determynation agreed
upon, and the confiction parted amongst them, the Ladies seeming marvelous
pleasant, ceased not daily to banquet with the Caspian Lords till the marriage
morning was come, whereon Rascianus going to the Temple, accompanied with his
Lords, and Cimbriana attended upon with her Ladies, they were solemnly married
by the Flamine: the rites performed and ended, and they returned to the
palace: the Caspians feasting for joy of this great tryumphe, passed away
dinner with great solemnity: Rascianus and the rest, sweetly swilled in their
cups; Bacchus liquor adding a heat to Venus charms, they fell after their
manner to dallying with the Ladies, who taking opportunity by the forehead,
called for wine, whereinto they put the poison, which drinking of to the Lords;
after the pledge passed, and Cimbriana saw her purpose had taken effect; with a
stern countenance looking upon Rascianus, she told him that now she had
quitted her cities spoil with reueng, for know tyrant (quoth she) that thou
and all thy Lords are impoysoned by the hands of women, who rather choose to
die in despair, then live unrevenged in the hands of an enemy: scarce had she
uttered this, but some of the Ladies, whose complexions were tender fell down
dead: Rascianus and his nobles amassed, and feeling the force of the poison to
work, called to the Physicians, but all in vain, for within one hour there
was not one of them alive: the Caspian Soldiers seeing their King and their
Captains dead, stood as men metamorphosed from their former sense: The
Citizens of the contrary part, hearing of the desperate attempt of their
princess, as men furious and incensed with the heat of reueng, getting on
their armor, gathered in troops, and setting upon the naked and amassed
Caspians, made such a bloody massacre of the poor wretches, that they left not
one alive, whatsoever he was that came as mercenary to Rascianus. This
stratageme performed, the dead carkases cast out of the City, Cimbriana and
her Ladies richly intoumbed the Citizens, and long after maintained their
cyuill estate with a peaceable and quiet democracy.

HElenus having ended his tragedy, the grecian Lords with a plawsible assent
praising his discourse, confessed that wisdom was of great force, able to
perform as much in human affairs as any other virtue whatsoever. And yet
(quoth Hector) we see that the end of Cleophanes policy had a dismal
counterpoise of reueng: that his wisdom could not prevent the feeble force of
one woman: that fortune grudging at such treachery repaied all his craft with
confusion. Let me (quoth Troilus) have such a conquest as men shall attribute
to courage, not to deceit, and that may end, dispight of the enemy him self,
in honor, not in curses, that Fortune may glory in for her favors, not fame
have cause to obscure with her darkest colors: I deny not but wisdom is
necessary in a Captain^, and therefore natural, as given to every man of
necessity: but valor, as it is expedient, so it is singularly bestowed upon
few, as a thing so precious that the gods do grudge to imparte it in common.

You measure (quoth Nestor) this wisdom which your Brother Helenus discoursed
with too bare a proportion, as counting what wit or rather reasonable
government we have by the ordinary or natural direction of our actions to be
wisdom, but his description proves the contrary, for he sets down that
to be wisdom which is a habit inserted by Nature, but augmented by Art and
Science, such as is able to discern between virtue and vice: so that none can
attain to be called Fortis, unless first he be Sapiens, for without
wisdom he shall fall either to excess or defect: either to be too
fearful, or too rash: and so passing that mean for want of wisdom commit
something worthy of blame. As thus they were ready to make further reply:
Andromache and the other Trojan Ladies seeing the sun declining to the west,
desirous to take their leaves hastened Hector from the company, who with the
rest breaking of from talk, after great thanks to his host Achilles, to
Agamemnon, Ulysses, and the other Lords, for their sumptuous intertainment,
with a request from Polixena and her sister Cassandra, that the next morrow
they would accompany Iphigenia, Briseis, and Cressida to the City, who had past
their promise to come, they offered to depart. Agamemnon only making excuse for
him self, but granting his consent to his daughter: the other noble men
promised to accompany the Ladies, and for confirmation thereof, after an
interchange of courtesies, mounting upon their coursers, they road with the
Ladies to the very walls of Troy; where after a friendly far^well, they
returned to their pauilions. Priamus glad to see his children so merry at home,
began to question with them of their intertainment, which Hector from point to
point rehearsed unto him, as before, with this addition, that the Gretians
meant to dyne with him the next day: whereupon Priamus made most princely
preparation.

The third discourse.
THe gladsome rays of Phoebus had no sooner shaken of, by the consent of
blushing Aurora, the dusky and darksome Mantle that denied Tellus and Flora the
benefits of Tytan, but the Grecian Ladies, and especially Cressida, who all
that night had smoothered in her thoughts the perfection of Troilus, were up
and at the pauilion of Achilles, to waken him from his drowsy nest: whose
dreams were but sweet slumbers conceipted by imagination of the beauty of his
fayer Polixena: The worthy Captain glad he had such pretty Cocks to crow him
from his dreams, hied him out of his bed, and with as much speed as might
be, sending for Ulysses, Diomedes, Patroclus, Nestor, and the rest, after a
small desiune, for fear of the air, they mounted with the Ladies, and trotted
on a solemn Pace toward Troy.

Hector having by his espials understanding of their coming, accompanied with
a worthy troop of Trojans, went to meet them, having before him upon white
Arabian Coursers three hundredth gentlemen, clad in purple Bisse, their Hats
plumed with crimson Feathers, that reached to the Arcons of their Saddles,
their Coparisons interpointed with broken Lances spotted with blood, about
the borders was written this sentence: Hac fortis sunt insignia.


Next to these, Hector, whose countenance threatened wars, and in whose face
appeared a map of martial exploits; framing his colors to his thoughts, was
seated on a black Barbarian Gennet, whose furniture was black Ueluet, set with
Adamants, interseamed with fluds, wherein were Salamanders bathing in content:
there was imbrodered in letters figured with Pearl, this, Sic pro Mart.


Hector thus in his Furniture met Achilles, and the Ladies, whom after
friendly salutations, and a second repaying of thanks for their good cheer,
they conducted to the City: where they no sooner entered the gate but Hecuba,
the stately Trojan Queen, attended on by Penthesilea the princess of the
Amazons, her daughters and other Ladies of great dignity, met them with most
royal intertaynment: whom after generally they had saluted, with a particular
welcome, they accompanied to the temple of Pallas, where aged Priamus, with six
and thirty other kings his allied frinds, amazed the Gretians with the sight
of their majesty: in so much, that Achilles as a man in a trance, confessed in
his thoughts, that this city was Microcosmos, a little World, in respect of
the Cytties of Greece. Pryamus noting how they stood in a muse, saluted them
in this manner.

Worthy Grecians, whom reueng and thirst of honor has haled out of your native
kingdoms, to sacrifice your blood at the walls of Troy: since in martial
minds enmity ought to hang at the Swords point, and thoughts in majesty
ought to be measured by promise; A league of friendship being pass for a
prefixed time, I account our city a free mart for the Grecians, and your Tents
a Sanctuary for the peaceable Trojans: which my daughters confirmed by proof,
in hazarding, upon the oath of an enemy, and you now ratefie, by committing
your selves into a walled city, peopled with your professed foes. But honor and
majesty brooking no treacherous suspicion, puts in assurance of safty:
omitting therefore all frivolous protestation, the Ladies first, as respecting
that once I was young, and the Lords, as now I am old: and both as I am
Priamus are heartely and unfeignedly welcome, to the poor besiedged city of
Troy: where if you find no sights but Armor, no music but the Drum, nor
no delicates but soldiers fare, impute it to your own wilfulness, and our
necessities, which are forced to bear reueng with fortune: hoping therefore
you will measure your intertainement by the time, Follow me to the Palace of
Il^um.

The Grecians thanking Priamus for his Pryncely courtesy, paced on to the
Palace, where alighting, and entering, they found all things ready furnished
for dynner, so that set down every man in his degree, they fell to such cheer
as so sudden a warning would afford, which was so sumptuous and (to say troth)
served in with such prodygall magnificence, as the Gretians thought Bacchus and
Caeres meant there to discover their superfluity: Feeding thus more with the eye
then glutting the stomach, yet taking their repast with good appetite, they
past over dynner with many pleasant discourses; which for breuity sake I
omit. Well, the Tables uncovered, Hecuba and the Ladies went to walk, and to
see the pleasures of the Palace: but the Lords sat still silent, until
Priamus began to put them from their muses with these words.

I remember (mighty princes of Greece and Asia) that my son Helenus commended
the Gretian banquets, to be more delicate then any other that before he had
seen: his reason was thus; that their fare was not so sumptuous, as their
philosophical discourses were delightful: so that to spend time well, they
amidst their cups ceased not to learn precepts of moral virtue; so alaying
the heat of Bacchus vynepresse, with the sweet conserues fetched from
Myneruaes Library: which as I greatly commend, he discoursed unto me your late
disputation about the perfection of a soldier, consisting by your distinct
division, in three parts, wisdom, fortitude, and liberality: all three
necessary, but the question which of them is most precious: the first being
discussed bad enough, as I coniec^^re by the man; it rests, if with your good
favors I might crave it, that now to adapt a fit digestion, we might hear
the second question decided.

Aged Nestor seeing they sat all silent, rising up, and uncovering his hoary
head, that shyned like the Silver gleaming Iuory, made him this answer:
Mighty Priamus, honorable for thy thoughts, and famous for thy Issus; feared of
Fortune, because in resolute majesty above Fortune; the Gretians knowing their
descent from the gods, therefore covet in actions to resemble the gods, which
they Imagine to do, by studying phylosophie to be come virtuous: so that they
measure their time by pleasures and their pleasures by profit, counting nothing
delightful, which is not both profitable and honest: which enforced us to
intertaine thy sons with our philosophical discourses, to try if their
virtues were only engraven by nature, or perfected by learning. How we found
them, give us leave to report in Greece, not in Troy: but so we esteem of
them, as we desire thy highness to forward our former disputation; which
belongs unto thy son Hector: namely to discourse of fortitude. Priamus
promised to farther so good a motion: and therefore commanded Hector, since he
took the defense of such a virtue, to maintain his charge: who duetifully
obeying his fathers command, seeing the Princes began to be attentive, began
his discourse in this manner.

Hectors discourse of Fortitude.
ALthough it might amase Esculapius to allege any of his Aphorisms in the
presence of Apollo, or Silenus to treat of the nature of Grapes in the hearing
of Bacchus; yet it is no offense in Pallas temple to treat of wisdom, nor at
Venus altars to parle of loves; since the goddesses do patronage such
affections. So, although the presence of such mighty princes, whose chieualry
is famous from the East to the West, and whose valor by experience is able to
deliver principles of magnanimity, might affray me from this enjoined
discourse of fortitude; yet, for that my fathers command is a law of
constraint, which Nature wills me to obey, and the request of the Grecians
such a claim, as duty forces me to grant; I will rather hazard my credit
on the honorable thoughts of these mighty Potentates, then seem either
scrupulous, or froward in gainesaying such a charge, hoping they will with
Prometheus, censure well of the workmanship of Lisias, and rather cast an eye
at the nature of the stone by secret instinct, then at the beauty pollished by
art; in which hope resting, thus to the purpose.

The Philosophers, whose lives spent in metaphusicall contemplation, having set
down in their precepts, the perfect pourtraiture of virtue, figure her bare
counterfeit, placed by equal proportion, between two vices, noting thereby,
that the mean kept between two extremes, is that laudable action, which by no
other name can be termed, but by the title of virtue; neither in excess,
soaring too high with Bolerophon, and so to hasard on the heat of ye sun,
nor in defect falling too low with Icarus, by the moisture of the Sea wetting
his feathers; but flying with Dedalus, in the mean, so with case and quiet
attayning to the desired end; as for an instance, fortitude seated between
two extremities, Timiditas, and Audacia; fear failing in defect, and rashness
faulty in excess; the mean being that courage which ought to be in a
Soldier. For all desperate attempts that bear the shadow of prowess, and
are of the common sort honored with the name of fortitude, are not
comprehended within the precinct of this virtue; for he only is counted a
valiant man, that without any furious or rash resolution, fears not to
hasard him self in ye greatest perils whatsoever, for the weal of his
country. So that by this definition we see, that he limited within the bonds
of measure, is not to v^^ture or make proof of his valor in every light
cause; yea, for every trifling thing, but with such proportion, as in scorning
death; yet he may honorably se^ke not to be counted desperate. For I remember
that Isadus a worthy Lacedemonian seeing their City besieged, and tha^ the
Soldiers resolutely issued out to fight with the enemy, he being their
Captain, stripped him self naked, and taking a Pollax in his hand, with such a
desperate fury gave the attempt, and so amazed, and repulsed them, that his
Soldiers imitating his courage put all their foes to the edge of the sword:
the battle ended, the Senators gave him a Crown of Laurel for the victory;
but fined him in a some of money for his rashness, in that he did so
unadvisedly put himself in danger, being the General of their forc^s. So
that we see, there ought in this virtue of fortitude certain circumstances to
be necessary, as how it be done, where it be done, and why it be done, and
when it be done; least in defect he be counted a Coward, and in excess a
desperate and unadvised governor. Your Grecian Annals tells us of one
Lamedos, that being a Captain over the Athenians, in a skirmish fled, which
one of his own soldiers seeing, cried in retyring to him: Lamedos, why
dishonorest thou thy Country by flight? Thou deceiuest thy self man (quoth
he^) I do but look to the profit that is behind me, which after he
confirmed by proof, for taking advantage of the place, he discom^^ted the
enemy, showing that he feared not death, but sought how to the profit of his
country, best to make manifest his courage.

Theseus yet living, who for his worthy and incomparable victories is
canonised, as come from the Offspring of the gods, being in a battle against
the Athenians entrenched him self with a strong countermure, and would not in
many days be drawn out to fight, which his enemy Lyme^tor seeing, coming to
the trench cried out and said; Theseus, if thou be such a hardy soldier as
Fame reports thee to be, why come thou not out, but like a coward lie
entrenched: nay (^uoth Theseus smiling;) Lymestor, if thou be of such
courage, why do thou not force me out of my trenches? By this delay,
showing that he sought to set Fortitude in her prime, to add opportunity to
his valor, and so to favor his prowess with fortunate advantage, that his
attempt, as it should be resolute, so it might be for the profit of his
Country, which insued according to his thoughts; for he slew Lymestor, and
all his people: Experience then tells us, as fortitude is necessary, so it is
to be used with such moderation, as by keeping the mean, it be counted a
virtue: How requisite it is in a Captain, consideration of his place makes
manifest; for being appointed General, and therefore Guyder and Governor of
the rest, he is to measure all his actions; yea, his very thoughts with such
an honorable resolution, as laying apart all fear of death whatsoever, his
charge and due^y is to hazard him self in any perils, though never so
dangerous, thereby to encourage his Soldiers, by imitating his valor to
attempt the like, to be foremost in the march; and last in the retrayte: to
prefer honor before death, and not to make estimation of the enemies, how
many they be, but where they be: otherwise in seeming to doubt of the
multitude, his fearful imagination greatly discourage his soldiers.

Sergius a worthy Captain, having but one hand, was of such courage and
valor, that being always in the face of the enemy: he returned Uictor in two
and fifty great battles. Lysias the worthy Prince of the Lacedaemonians being
demanded how he was honored with so many conquests, pulling out his sword,
made answer; that with this he made Fortune subject to his desiers:
attributing more credit to his own prowess, than to the inconstant deity of
such a fickle goddess. A Grecian Captain, whose name comes not readily to
memory, being in a sore battle against that mighty Monarch Pisandros, seeing
his countrymen ready to flee for fear of the multitude of the enemy, whose
fleet almost covered the Sea, sought to persuade them, but in vain; whereupon
he sent secretly one of his sons in a little skyfe to Pisandros, to tell him
that his countrymen would escape by such a passage: which he taking kindly,
and presently stopping, added such a courage to the coward^s, that by this
policy drawn to battle, they put Pi^andros with great loss to flight:
where we see how greatly the incomparable fortitude of the Captain did
prevail in the getting of victory.

In deed (quoth Troilus) I do remember that Apollo, being demanded by the
inhabitants of Phasiaca, what captain they should choose for the subduing of
the Milesians: his oracle answered. Such a one as dare for the weal of his
country, leap into the Mylesian gulf: whereupon they returned, and made
proclamation that their fr^edome could not be, unless one willingly offered
himself as a sacrafice to Neptune: the men of Phasiaca naturally fearful,
sought every man his own saf^y, till at last a poor man, whom want had made
desperate, offered him self: him they those for their Captain, and going
forth to meet the Milesians, having little skill in ordring his men, yet with
such resolution, set upon the enemies, tha^ by his means they returned
victors. Truth (quoth Hector) of such force is fortitude, that the very name of
courage daunteth the enemy: for I have heard my father Priamus often make
mention of one Nasycles, who was so famous for his cheualry and prowess, that
his very name was a warrant o^ victory to his soldiers: in so much that after
his death^ in a great battle his countriemen being almost discomfited,
causing one to put on his armor, they fought a fresh, and cried Nasycles:
which so affrighted the enemy, that they fled and were vanquished. To be short,
wh^t can a captain, were he never so wise, attempt by policy, but he must
perform by Fortitude? What ambush so cunningly planted, but would be
overthrown, if guarded with cowards? what encounter, though fortune swore the
victory, and taken with most great advantage, could be achieved, if the
Captain for fear discourage his Soldiers from the assault? which the
forenamed Sergius noted very well, in that how small so ever his number was,
yet he would always give the onset, saying that soldiers which stood at
receipt, and felt the furious attempt of the enemy, were half discomfited:
neither does liberality prevail to encourage the So^ldiers to battle, when
they see their captain stand more upon his purse then his person, and had
rather encounter with pelf^ then with the sword. To confirm which
forerehearsed premises, pleases your honorable patience to give me leave, I
will rehearse a pleasant and tragical history: Priamus taking a delight in
his sons discourse, nodding his head, gave sufficient proof they were
content to be patient auditors: whereupon Hector began his tale thus.

Hectors Tragedy. Audaces Fortuna adiu^at.
IN the kingdom of Egypt, as the Cronicles of the Caldes makes mention, there
ruled sometime as king and Sovereign of the Country, one Sosthenes, a prync^
whose Courts flourished with Laurel wreathes, more then with steeled Armor;
and in whose City of Memphis were more Academies for Philosophers, then
Storehouses for warlike munition: as one that delyghted wholly in a peaceable
time, to apply him self and his Subjects to the study of good letters,
accounting no thing more precious, then what was cunningly begun by Nature
curiously to be perfected by art: Loved generally he was of his bordring
neighbors in that finding content in his thoughts, he sought not to enlarge
that his Father had left him, by extorting an other man's due, but quietly lived
a friend to foreign Princes, and studied to keep his own Domynions from
cyuill mutinies. Being thus happy, as one that knew not what mishap meant:
Fortune intending to make him a particular instance, on whom without change to
pour her momentayne pleasures, ^ent him three sons, the Eldest named
Frontinus, was from his youth addicted to martial discipline, taking no
delight but in armor: in so much that before he was come to ye age of sixteen
years, he excelled most of all ye Egyptian Lords in feats of arms: which
seeing in a peaceable country he could not practice, he secretly stole from
his father, and tra^ailed into those parts where he heard blood and revenge
were painted on their Ensigns; being of such courage and dexterity in the
field, that the fame of his valor and prowess was not only renowned in the
court of Memphis, but bla^ed through the whole world, like a second Mars: His
other Brother, called Martignanus, contrary wise followed the steps of his
father, seeking rather after the Precepts of phylosophie, then ye knowledge of
martial discipline; counted that head as glorious, that was Crowned with a
Laurel Garland, as that which was impalled with a Diadem; thinking as great
Dignity to come from the pen, as the scepter; as high renown to flow from
the well-^pring of Wisdom, as from the possession of the greatest Monarchs
in the world: In so much, that neither the Bragmans, Gymnosophists, Caldees, or
other Philosophers whatsoever did exceed him, either in moral prynciples, or
in the Physical reasons of natural Philosophy: the youngest, whose name was
Ortellius, being neither so martial as Frontymus, nor so bookishe as
Martignanus, yet had a special conceit above them both in the bounty of his
mind, being so liberal, as he counted no action virtuous, which ended not in
reward, nor no day well spent wherein he had not bestowed some gift, placing
his Summu^ Bonum, in this, that with a restless desire of largess he won
the hearts of all the commons of Egypt: Sosthenes blessed thus with three such
sons, as for their several virtues were famous through ye world, feeling
that old age, the forerunner of death, had given him somons by his Heralt
sickness, to pay his debt unto nature, seeing neither Crowns nor kingdoms
could privilege the necessity of fate, he only sorrowed that at his death
his eldest son was wanting, and unknown where, whom otherwise he might in
his life have installed in his kingdom; yet using the benefit of time, calling
his two sons Martignanus, and Ortellius before him, with the rest of his
nobles, he uttered unto them these words, as his last farewell.

Age and time two things, Sons that men may forethinke of, but not prevent,
have with a fatal necessity enjoined, that my soul leave this mortal body
and transitory Cell, to go to that place of rest appointed, according to well
deserved actions, for those that pass out of this pilgrimage: feeling
therefore my feeble age to wax weak, and my breath so short, as I look every
moment to go to my last home, I thought at my death to give some sign of my
fore passed life, and so to make distribution of my Crown and Kingdom, as no
dissension after my death may breed any civil mutiny. This therefore is my
will, that Frontynus have my Crown and Kingdom, as his by right and
inheritance, and by desert of martial discipline; but in his absence, till
hearing of my Funerals he make repair to Memphis, I commit it into the hands
of you two, to be governed by your advice, and at his sight, peaceably to be
redelyuered into his possession. The Dukedom of Lysia Martignanus I give unto
thee; and son Ortellius, to thee I bequeath all my mooueables, wealth, and
treasures whatsoever. Having thus first placed you as joint partners in a
Kingdom, take heed my sons gase not too high: aspyring thoughts, as they
are lofty, so they are perilous, and danger ever hanges at the heel of
ambition: a crown is a sugared object, and there is no sweeter good then
Sovereignty: but Est virtus placidis abstinuisse bonis, take heed, the finest
Delycates are often most infectious, and Crowns are as brittle, as they are
glistering; then live in content, think it is your Brothers right, and your
Fathers gift. Son Ortellius, thou art wise and learned, but beware thou
soar not too high in self conceit, and with Phaeton fall headlong into
mishap. Endimion was counted but too rash, in falling in love with Luna, Quae
supra nos nihil ad nos, take heed my son, Noli altum sapere, clymbe not too
high in imaginations, gaze not with the Astronomer so long at the stars,
that thou stumble at a stone: poare not so long at thy book, that thou forget
domestical affairs: pass not so far in the motions of the heavens, that
thou be negligent what to do upon earth: let not the old proverb tread on
thy heel, that the greatest clerks are not the wisest men; thou have a
Dukedom; that possess in quiet and govern with Justice, so shall thou live
happy, and die honorable. Ortellius, to thee I have given all my treasure, so
much as exceeds number: but take heed, for r^^hes are thorns that prick
men forward to many mishaps: be not too prodigal, for of courtesy I need
not forewarne thee: ^xcesse in every thing is a vice; goods wasted are like
blossoms nipped off with an untimely frost: poverty is the soarest burden
that can fall upon honor; and riches consumed, men cease to be envied, and
begin to be pitied. But such ^xchange is miserable: gifts are little gods,
which as they are honored in time, so the remembrance thereof perishes with
time: give not, and thou shall not be galled with ingratitud: yet some give,
and be^ liberal, for it is the cognizance of majesty; but so, as respecting
the main chance, thou may have always to give: let a few precepts
suffice, and print t^em well in your hearts, and therefore imitate them in your
life, since I mean to seal them with my death: after this, many days did not
pass before Sosthenes died, whose Funerals sorrowfully and solemnly
celebrated, and they by their fathers will and consent of the Lords appointed
ioynt-protectors of the kingdom. Ambition, ye Serpent that stily insinuates
into men's minds, not suffering love or Lordship to brook any fellowship,
entering league with Envy and Fortune, two enemies to Peace and prosperity,
began to present them with the desire of a kingdom, and to think that fathers
wills were buried with their bodies in their graves: that their commands were
dated but while death, and that for a Crown both father and law is to be
neglected. Martignanus, wisest and eldest, thought that Pallas had power on
earth as she had in heaven: that men's hearts were tied to their ears, that
Eloquence could as much prevail to persuade, as Mercuries Pipe to inchaunte:
that the commons, whose minds were to be won by plawsible discourses, would
sooner create him king then his brother: taking therefore Time by the
foreheade, seeing his eldest Brother was absent, and uncertain assurance of
his life: he began to imagine how he might displace Ortellius, from y^ part of
such a royal Legacy: his mind was not thus fraught with aspiring thoughts,
but Ortellius was as forward in the same supposition: for feeling by a little
experience, what a sweet thing it is to command: and taking a delight in the
pleasant taste of a crown, he thought by creeping into the commons hearts, to
raze his brother quite out of their books: and this his conjecture was
somewhat probable. For he considered with himself, that Qu^d non mortalia
pectora cogit? auri sacra fames, that liberality was the soundest rethorick^,
that gifts were hooks that men would willingly swallow, were they never so
bare. How wisdom was a good thing, but men did esteem more of gold than of
books, and would sooner be won by the feeling of wealth then ^he hearing of
words: that conscience bare no touch where coin brought in her plea: that the
common people, whose minds sought after ease and satiety, had rather live
rich than wise, and would make more account of a coffer full of gold, than of
ten of the greatest libraries in the whole world: hoping upon these
conjectures sparing no expense, since a day should come that would pay for all,
he gave freely of that which his father lent him, keeping great hospitality (a
great persuasion to win the common sort) and giving franckely (a bait to
allure the highest and wisest peer in the kingdom,) Martignanus espying a pad
in the straw, and seeing how subtly his brother stole away the commonalty:
nay the whole realm by his liberality, began to check his prodigality in
open audience, and with a long discourse to reprehende the spending of his
fathers goods in such riotous manner. Ortellius taking occasion of these
speeches, told him^ what he spent was upon his friends, and that he could have
no surer stewardes of his wealth than his faithful and loving subjects: upon
which they fell to jar in words, and from words to blows: so that not
only the city of Memphis, but the whole Monarchy of Egypt was in an uproar,
and this dissension grew at last to civil mutiny: so that taking arms, the
brothers began to incampe themselves in the field, and parts being taken on
both sides, Ortellius for his surest placard proclaimed himself king of Egypt,
and caused himself to be crowned. Martignanus not behind challenged the
diadem, and installed himself with the like proclamation: whereupon in flat
terms of de^^ance they fell to mortal and deadly wars. The eldest with his
sweet Oratitions promising, so wisely and warely to govern the common wealth,
as in choosing him for king, they should have peac^ and quiet, as in his
fathers days: whose virtuous actions he meant to take for a president of his
government. The youngest swore to be bountiful, and that in taking him for
king the streets should flow with milk and honey, and poverty should never
be heard within the gates of Memphis. Armed thus on both sides, a day of
battle was set, wherein when both the armies were martial^d and placed in
their several ranckes, and either vauntgardes ready to join. Martignanus
encouraged his soldiers with long and sweet orations. Ortelius promised, if
the victory were his, he would bestow all the spoil amongst his men, and make
the meanest of them all to live in plenty: the skirmish furiously begun,
continuing for the space of thr^e hours, with great massacre and bloodshed,
fell at last on Ortellius side: so that Martignanus was feign to fly, and for
safety to incampe himself upon a hill. While these two breethren continued in
(...) dissension, Fame, the speedy heralt of news, had brought it to the ears
of Frontinus (who then was in the Court of Mae^ion ^he great Despotte of
Af^ica, and for ^und^y services ^ahauntly performed in wars in high
estima^ion) how his father was dead, and his brothers at (...) ^or the
kingdom, upon which report, discovering the (...) ^o Maesion, he craved his
^ide to set him peaceably in ^is kingdom. The Despotte of Africa glad that
Fortune h^d (...) him occasion to show himself grateful to Fron^^^^^,
g^aunt^^ him ten thowsande of his best approved (...) so hardy and well
experienced in mar^^all discipline, that ^he worst of them would have seemed
to ha^^ go^^rn^d a whole army. Frontinus guarded thus wi^h ^h^se Gensdar^ies,
taking his leave of Maesion, pass^d (...) all h^^^ towa^^s Egypt: where after
wea^ysome ^ournies arrived: he was no so^ner entered, but report had ^^^ted
abroad his return: which no sooner came to the ears of the ^wo Brothers, but
it struck them in a maze: for neither did Martignanus trust so much upon his
wisdom, nor Ortellius upon his ^^beralitie: (...) that they seared ^o
encounter with the fortitude of Frontinus, whose valor was such as his very
name was sufficient to repress the rebellious thoughts of his enemies. Now
began there to be a combat between Envy and Ambition: for Envy thirsting for
revenge, willed the brethren particularly to revolt to Frontinus: but ambition
persuades them rather to become friends, and to part a kingdom betwixt them,
then utterly to be dispossessed from their Diadems: resolving thus with them
selves, they concluded frindly, and swore to keep Frontinus from his
inheritance: but he whom no report could daunt, drawing nigh to the place
where his brethren lay encamped, whom jointly, as he understood were
contracted, and resolved to bend both their forces against him, thought to
demand his right by courtesy, and so sent one of his Lords to know the
cause of their civil wars, and to cra^^ a par^e: Martignanus who was very
polliticke consented, and pledges given on both sides, they met: where after a
dissembled courtesy past between them, Frontinus began in Brotherly terms
to che^ke their foolish and unbridled presumption, that would so rashly seek
each others overthrow for the momenta^y possession of an other man's right: the
kingdom I mean (quoth he) which my father left me, both by will and
inheritance: such a Legacy as I mean not to loose, nor I hope you intend not
to desire: therefore laying down these weapons, and wyping out this civil
controversy, dismiss your soldiers, and friendly let us go home to the City.
You mistake you greatly (quoth Martignanus) for how soever you conclude your
supposed Syllogism upon inheritance, we mean to deny your argument by the
proof of my fathers Testament: for as birth by eldership allotts you a Crown,
so his will by command has deprived you of that privilege, and part^d the
kingdom betwixt us: therefore without any more frivolous circumstances, for
your welcome take this of m^e: we have it, and we will keep it, despite of
him that dare gain say: swearing until death to maintain our right by the
sword. Frontinus whose courage could not brook entreaties, especially for his
own right, told them that he sorrowed at their follies, since they did not with
a deep^ in-sight fore see their own myseries, and espy reueng that presented a
fatal Tragedy of their misfortunes: and with that he turned his back in
great choler, swearing before night either to wear the Crown, or leave his
Carcass in the field. Or^ellius smiling at his Brothers attempt, for that they
had ten to one, passing with Martignanus to the army, set their men in array,
and imbattailed them with great speed, the one giving incouragment by sweet
orations, the other with the remembrance of his forepassed liberality.
Frontinus having ordered his soldiers and come within view, by computation
might conjecture that his enemies were about threescore thousand: and seeing
his men half frighted at ye presence of such a multitude, began to hasten them
forward in this manner.

I need not worthy gentlemen and soldiers of Africa seek to encourage you
with a long discourse, unless putting oil in the flame, I should ad a spur to
a free horse: your former valiant resolutions manifested in many battles, the
honor whereof still glories your names with renown, assures me were the enemy
like the sands in the sea, and Mars oppo^ed against our forces: yet the
quarrel good, and our minds armed with invincible fortitude, the virtue that
dares Fortune in her face, maugrefates and destinies we shall, as ever
hitherto we have done, return with conquest. And for that ye cause touches my
self and you fellow partners of my fortunes, I will be the first man in the
battle, and the last man in the field, unless death give me an honorable
quittaunce of my kingdom: let me be a mirror this day of your magnanimity:
let my actions be your presidents: press but as far as your general, and
courage gentlemen, the victory is ours: see how my sorrowful cou^trymen st^nd
to receive us whose cowardice dare scaresly march a foot to meet: I see, yea,
I see in deed in their very faces the portraiture: therefore, God and our
right: and with that catching a strong staff, pulling down his beuier, and
putting spurs to his horse, he furiou^ly rusht upon ye enemy, his soldiers
following with such a desperate resolution, that ye Egyptians amazed at ye valor
of their king, who like a lion massacring whom he met, ran without stop through
the troops, they laid down their weapons and yielded without any great
slaughter, whereupon y^ Africans stayed, but Frontinus forgetful y^ they were
his native cou^trymen still raged, till meeting his brother Martignanus, he
slew him, and never left murdering till finding out Ortellius that fled in
chase, he gave him his deaths wound: stayed at last by one of the Lords of
Africa, and told how the battle was ended by ye submission of his subjects,
who were ashamed that they had been so forgetful of their allegiance, causing
the retreat to be sounded, he peaceably marched on toward Memphis, where
putting certain of the chief offenders to the sword, and interring his
brethren, after his Coronation he sent the Africans home well rewarded with
many rich presents to their king, living him self afterward most fortunate.

Hector having ended his Tragedy. The Grecians noting in his Countenance the
very counter^ayte of magnanimity, and in discoursing of valor, his very face
presented a myrrour of fortitude, measuring his inward thoughts by his outward
gestures, did both commend the History and allow of censure: saying, that
where courage manaceth revenge with the Sword, there it is folly to bring in
wisdom in her Purple Roabes. Helenus hearing how the Grecians favored his
Brother Hectors verdite, wished them to take heed they infringed not the sacred
praise of wisdom: for (quoth he^) as Pallas is learned, so she is martial:
and Minerua has as well a Spear, as a ^en: perhaps Martignanus was only a
Philosopher and no soldier: whereas by the sequel it is inferred that
Frontinus was both wise and valiant: so that adding to his wisdom fortitude,
he did the more easily obtain the conquest. Truth (quoth Nestor) for Hector
him self confessed that fortitude could not be without wisdom, seeing, being
placed between too extreme want of wisdom, might make him offend in defect,
and so be counted a coward: or in excess, and be thought too desperate. If
then fortitude cannot be perfect without wisdom, and yet a man may be wise
without courage, it may be co^cluded^ that wisdom is the most necessary point
in a soldier. We deny not (quoth Troilus) but it is necessary, but not in
the superlatiue degree, for wisdom supposed the cause, fortitude consequently
is the effect; since the one of it self may intend by policy: but the other
is put in practice by prowess. Still for our purpose, (quoth Helenus) for the
Logicians hold it as a principle, that the cause is greater then the effects:
the Philosophers account a wise man only to be virtuous, thinking that
wisdom being the chief virtue, produces the rest as seeds sprung from so
fair a Stem: for it is possible for a man to want others, having this: but
to possess none, if this be absent. Hector, a little chollericke that so
bravely they went about to prove his harvest in the grass, stammered out
these or such like words. I tell you brother Helenus, both you and the rest
are deceived, and that I will prove against the wisest soldier in the world
with my sword, that Senators who sit to give counsel for Civil policy, had
need to be wise, since their opinions are holden for Oracles, and Captains
valiant, whose deeds are accounted peremptory conquests: put case wisdom
and fortitude be in a General, yet is he called wise as he gives judgment,
and courageous as with a hardy mind he attempts the victories. Let men have
science in their heads, and no weapons in their hands, and whom can they
prejudice: I say therefore, which none rightly can gainesay, that fortitude is
most necessary for a soldier, since our common phrase confirms my reason with
evidence, in saying, he is a wise Senator and a hardy soldier.

The Grecians seeing the sparkling flames of choler to burn in the face of
Achilles, smiled to see how hot he was in disputation, measuring by probable
conjecture, that if he met them in the field he would affright them more
with his sword, the^ either Nestor or Helenus with all their Books: Vlisles
merrily disposed, being ready to reply, the Ladies came in, who broake of their
talk with telling them the unlooked for bravery of Ilium, discoursing so long of
the sundry sights they had seen within the walls of Troy, till the boordes
being covered, aged Priamus rising from his seat, placed all his guests down
at supper.

The fourth discourse of Liberality.
SO desirous were the kings and princes to hear the discourse of liberality
to be discussed by Achilles, that no sooner was supper ended, and the Ladies
walked abroad, but that they settling them selves, as Philos^phers in some
Academie: framed them selves to be silent Audytors to his parle: but he, if
possible it had been, unwilling to have been actor in such a royal audience,
sat still without pressing to the discovery of y^ former purposes, until
Hector wakened him out of his Melancholy, in this manner. Seeing honorable
Achilles, for^une has dealt unequally, in allotting the former charge to two
such, as ignorant of Phylosophicall principles, have rudely delivered what
experience has set down by proof, and now to recompense her wrong
proportion, has for^peinted such a champion, to defend the patronage of
liberality, as has t^mpered martial affairs with the sweet deaw of sacred
Sciences: let us not miss of that which the slippe^y goddess so charie of,
has given us with such nyggardly proportion: it rests therefore, you show
the necessity of liberality in a Soldier, and not only, that it is requisite,
but more expedient then either wisdom or fortitude: which if you con^irme by
reasons, and we allow as plawsible, we yield our selves vanquished by him
whom we never hoped to overcome. It stands (quoth Priamus) for his credit^
since being accounted one of the most worthy soldiers in the world, he cannot
but know what is most nec^ssary in the state of a Captain. As Achilles was
ready to reply, the Ladies came, and desirous to know the effect of their
discourse, Ulysses made answer, that is was a discovery of women's rethoricke:
And I pray you sir (quoth Hecuba) what might that be, do not men and women
agree in the principles of that Science. Mary Madame (quoth he) it is to
describe the force of liberality, such a sweet plea in a woman's ear, that
hardly it may be asked that bounty has not of freewill granted: for an ounce
of give in a Ladies ballaunce, weygheth down a pound of love me. Are you
Grecian Dames (quoth Hecuba to Iphigenia) so covetous as you measure affection
by gold, and tie up Fancy in the purse stringes, I am sure my Lord Ulysses
speaks by experience, and yet he was never acquainted with any Troiane
Ladies, to make proof of their desiers. Iphigenia blushed, and Ulysses to
maynetaine his quarrel, told them that Juno was Jealous as well in ^arth as
in heaven: Venus wanton as well in Paphos, as in Cypres: that the women had
generally one mind, wheresoever they were bred, and therefore his conclusion
was general. Hold there (quoth Priamus) these women are but stumbling blocks
for our eyes, and our thoughts: let them chat with them selves, and leave us to
our discourse: Hecuba sitting down, and the rest of the Ladies silent:
Achilles seeing the sovereign of his desiers, fa^re Polixena, endeavored to do
his best, and therefore thus rudely went to the matter.

Achilles discourse of Liberality.
ORpheus, whose music was so sweet, that the poets feign his melody appeased
the passionate ghosts from their auailes, when he went for Euridice, say that
he was so bashful in his science, though the most exquisite that ever was, as
he blushed to tune his Harp before Mercury: whereas Hypercion an unskillful
musition, shamed not to trouble him with his daunces: ignorance has ever the
bouldest face, blind Bayard is foremost in the front, and thy which worst may,
will foremost desire to hold the candle: I speak this, since my self whom
years and experience would have wished to be silent, by too over rash censuring
of a soldiers estate, fondly thrust my self into the opinions of many,
re^embling herein Mineruaes Owl, that se^ks not ^o shroud her deformity in the
Temple. But forward minds, if not offensive, may forecraue pardon: actions
well meant ought to be well taken: honor judges with partiallity in being
opinatiue toward strangers: majesty wincketh at follies, and sooner will
Jupiter bear with a fault, then Vulcan: the higher thoughts the sooner
pleased, which consid^red, I am the more bold in such an audience to hazard my
credit on the sequel of their verdites, and rather be counted a little too
rash, then too much unruly; hoping therefore my discourse shall be favored
with your honorable patience: thus to the purpose.

Hermes Trismegistus, whom some for his divine precepts, have thought to be
the son of Mercury, made such account of this virtue of liberality, that he
doubted not to call it the heavenly influence, yt the gods most niggardly had
in^used into the mynds of men this, resembling their deities, that they grudged
not to impart what Fortune franckly had bestowed upon them. For the Philosopher
that coueteth in his Ethics to ^en down a platfourme for the perfecting of
human life, amongst other virtues, places this as forerunner of them all:
inferring his argument for proof ( a contrarijs) if says he, covetousness be
the root^ of all ill, from whence proceeds as from a fountain of mishap, the
ruin of common wealths, the subversion of Estates, and the wrack of
^economicall societies: if from thence does issue injustice, bribery, the
slain of conscience, slaughters, treasons, breach of amity, confusion of
mind, and a million of other mischievous enormities: how precious a Jewel,
how divine a motion, how sweet a virtue is Liberality, that preserves all
these in a true and peaceable concord: Prodigality, which without care wastes
what time and diligence by long travel has purchased, is such a Moath to
eat out the labors of men, that our Predecessors called it a fire of the
mind, which is so impatient in heat, as it cease not while any matter
combustible is pre^ent, to burn necessary things to very dust and cynders:
through this comes poverty, want, distress, and in the end despair:
whereas liberality, the contrary to this vice keeps such a direct mean
between both, as it preserves Fortune, Fame, and Honor in their just and
equal proportion: So exquisite are the principles to be observed in this
virtue, as it suffiseth not to attain to the perfection of it by giving, only
respecting the circumstances of time, person, and quality: but in receiving,
stands a principal point of liberality: for if either we take from him that
can ill spare it, or more then desert afordes, or without a resolution to be
grateful, did we our selves give mountains, yet we cannot be honored with
the title of liberality, in that by greedy receipt of untimely gifts, we
bewray certain sparks of insatiable couetise: which Lisander noted very well,
who being presented by certain of his poor neighbors with sundry presents,
sent them all home, but with great thanks: saying ^s one of his friends, see
thou not how liberal Lisander has been too day, in bestowing so many good
gifts upon poor men: nay I have not (quoth his friend) seen thee give any
thing at all: But I have (answered Lisander) returned those presents, which I
could not have taken without their hinderance: meaning that prejudicial gifts
are rubbed with dishonor, and bring with them hatred and infamy. Theocritus an
ancient Poet of ours, calls liberality the thief that most secretly
steals away the minds of men: his reason is this, that all estates for the
most parte^ adicted to covetousness and greedy desire of gain, cast their
eyes ever after that object that glistereth most with riches, and set their
opinions and censures with partiality on those whom Fortune has favored with
many treasures: such says he (as most be) that are blinded with this
covetous desire, are tied so stricktly to the purse of a liberal man, as he
may at his pleasure draw to what he purposes to employ their uses: In such
estimation have our predecessors had this virtue, that they accounted not that
day amongst the terms of their years, wherein they did not liberally bestow
some benefits.

But to touch more particularly a perfect dyscourse, and to prove that it is
necessary in a soldier, let us note the end of martial desires, which I
remember, once I hard Thes^us divide into three parts: the first and
principal, honor generally aimed at by all, but specially belonging to the
Captains, yet due to the meanest soldier for his prowess: The second, the
conquest, which fortune imparteth as her favor to the general, and f^me to
the rest of the soldiers: the last, desire of spoil and treasures gotten with
the sword, and so hardly attained with the hazard of life: this ought the
common sort of mercenary Souldyers to have as their due, as a recompense for
their perils, and an encourage to such warlike endeavors: for if the conquest
and honor be allotted to the Captain, what great injustice is it to deny the
rest, the benefit of a little momentanie pelf: which moved a worthy Captain
of Thebes, when he had obtained a victory against the Lacedaemonians, of all the
spoil only to take one sword, distributing the rest amongst his soldiers:
saying, fellows in arms, this I challenge, since I wrong it out of the hand
of mine enemy: what soever else, is yours, as the reward of your travels: for
the Theban Senators war for honor, not for treasure. The mercenary man that
bears arms for hier, and for his ordinary pay, fear^th not to venture his
life in the face of his enemy, having but his wages he has but his bare due,
so that if hope of spoil and the bounty of his Captain did not encourage him
in his attempts, he would both doubt the danger of his person, and scorn for
so little gain to run upon such ^minent perrills: which caused Zoroastes in
his great war against the Egyptians, to give rich gifts to the meanest of
his soldiers, promising the spoils of Egypt for the guerdon of their valor:
his liberallity taking such effect, as he returned with conquest: The great
Monarche of the world, whose name I need not rehearse, did see that liberality
was such a glory in a Captain, and such a spur to a soldier, that at his
departure out of Greece, with resol^tion to make a general conquest of the
whole world: he gave to his Captains and other men at arms, all his riches,
treasures and possessions, reserving only for him self, the hope of the
prowess. For what does the wisdom of the Captain by long and sweet
orations, and sundry policies? what does the fortitude of a general, by
hazarding him self among the thickest of his enemies prevail: only in these
two points, he aymeth at his own profit, the overthrow of his enemy, and
perhaps a little incourageth his soldiers: but what reapes the mercenary and
popular man, if withal he be coueto^s, but scarres, wounds, and penary: nay
what does the Captain^ get if with a deep in-sight he looks into the
soldiers mind, but a dissimuled love, a secret hate, an intended contempt,
and a forced courage rather to defend themselves from peril, then to hazard
their lives for his safty: whereas the Captain that is liberal, not only in
paying their wages (which I count it a sacrilege to deny,) but in imparting
the spoil (which I hold as their due) so ti^th the minds of his soldiers to
him with an unfeigned affection, that they count no peril too dange^ous, no
attempt too hard, no nor force not of death to signify their leave and desire
to recompense his liberality. I remember I have red of Cassius a Barbarian
prince, which intending wars to the Libians, coming with a small power into
Libia, passed with little resistance even to the very paui^ion of their king^
where after a small skirmish, he took him prisoner, and used him princely,
blaming his soldiers that would not adventure more desperately for the safty
of their prince: after, passing into the City, in sacking his palace, he
found such infinite treasure as might have hiered a multitude of mercenary men
for the defense of his country. Whereupon, no^ing the couetize of the man, he
so hated him, that shutting him in his treasury amongst all his gold, he
pyned him to death: saying he was worthy of all mishap, that would not
continually keep ten Legions of soldiers to eat up such riches: by which we
see what contempt a covetous Captain incurreth by his niggardize: whereas
liberality is an ornament both to wisdom and fortitude, and such a precious
Jewel, as no value may suffice to estimate. To confirm which, as Hector and
Helenus have done, I mean to rehearse a Tragedy, so your honorable presence
shall favor me with patience. Achilles seeing by their countenance they
expected no less, began his tale in this manner.

Achilles Tragedy. Index animi liberalitas.
IN the City of Athens (famous through the world for Philosophers and
Soldiers) amongst the Senators ^ for the state of the City was Aristocratia,
there ruled as chief (honored generally for his good parts) one Roxander,
chosen by the consent of the Senate Dictator in the wars, this b^ing ele^ted
Captain, was so favored by fortune, as he never waged batta^le wherein he
remained not victor^ in so much as the fame of his happy success was a warrant
to the Athenians of their safty. Of stature he was small, of mean courage, no
man greatly lettered: but to ^ecompence these defects, he was of such exceeding
bounty and liberality to all men, but especially to his soldiers, that his
very countenance was sufficient to encourage the most bash^ull coward to the
combat: For the Athenians by their law gave all the spoils gotten in wars to
the Captain, only appointing to the soldiers their ordinary pay: but
Roxander, as he triumphed in many ^ictories, never inrich^d him self, but
equally imparted the treasures of the enemy amongst the soldiers according to
their deserts: being of such a liberal mind toward them that prof^ssed
martial discipline, that at his own charges he founded hospitalls for such
as were maimed in the wars, that their relief might ad a glory to his
renown: G^uing dowries to the daughters of such as were slain, and in peace
being a father to all them over whom he had been a Captain^ in wars. Envy
the secret enemy of honor, grudging as well at his virtues as his fortunes,
brought him in as deep hate with the Senators, as he was in favor with the
soldiers: for they suspecting that he meant by this liberality to insinu^te
into the hearts of the commons, and to steal away the minds of the popular
sort, so to plant him self as sole governor: (the only thing they feared,
least their Aristocracie should be reduced to a Monarchy) by a penal law
called Ostracisme, found fault with his aspyring and so did not only
confiscate his goods, but condemn him for ^uer into exile: Roxander having the
sentence of his vanishment pronounced, thinking fortune meant to gi^e him a
check, thought as roughly to deal with her, and therefore put up her abuse
with patience, smiling, that when the s^nat had prised the inven^orie of his
goods, the sum amounted not to so much as would discharge his passage into
Sycilia, whither he was banished. But the soldiers and popular sort, hearing
of this injury, as men furious, got them to arms, and in great multitude
flocked to the door of the senate house, where they swore to reueng the wrong
offered to Roxander: The Senates and censors with other officers of the City,
sought by threats and other persuasions to appease them: but in vain, till
that Roxander preferring the quiet of his country before his own private
welfare, standing upon the staiers, descending from the council chamber,
pacified them with this brief Oration.

Citizens of Athens, famous through all Greece for your dutiful obedience in
peace, and resolute endeavors in wars: accounted the presidents of perfect
subjects, by manifesting reverence to such as the gods have placed as gods to
govern men, I mean the grave and wise S^nators: what madness has incensed
your minds? what fury has forced this vproare? what means the noise of
armor, and the weapons as fearful object in such a peaceable time, unless
desirous to seek your own ruin, you intend a civil mutiny, the fall of your
selves, and the fatal mishap of your posterity? what do you want? who has
offered wrong? are not the Senators set to minister Justice? an^ with that
before he could utter any more words they cried out: we swear to keep thee
from banishment, and have sworn to revenge thy in^ury, whom we love more then
all the Senators. After the noise was so ceased that he might be heard,
Roxander went forward in his speech: if it be^ for me (worthy Cityz^ns) you
have taken armor in seeking to grace me with your favor, you pinch me with
dishonor: in coveting my lib^rty, you bring me within the bondage of infamy:
The Senate has past judgment against me in justice, and I content to brook
the penalty of the law with patience: offenses must be punished, and
punishments borne with quiet, not with revenge: Have I lived forty year a
duetifull subject in Athens, and shall I now by your means be accounted a
mutinous rebel? no, loving countrymen: if ever my deserts have been such, as
ye think me your friend, lay away your weapons, return every man to his
own house, so shall Roxander account you his friend^^; otherwise, for ever
take you as his enemies. No sooner had he spoken these words, but every man
peaceably, though sorrowfully, went home to his house: and he within three
days sailed poor, and dismissed into Sycilia. Roxander had not lived long in
exile, but a quarrel grew between the Thebans and the Athenians, about the
deflowring of a maid of Athens: whereupon, as envy stirs up a secret
grudge soon to revenge, the Athenians by advice of the Senate, mustred their
men, leauied a great host, over whom there was appointed sir wise and grave
Senators, the youngest of which ha^ been before times Dictator, to have the
conduct of the army, and over them all as General was placed Clytomaches, a
man of invincible valor and fortitude, stored thus with men and munition, with
wise and valiant Chieftaines, they passed on toward Thebes: by the way giving
assault to a strong and rich city called Lis^um, the soldiers thinking to
find in Clytomaches Roxanders liberality, so suriously gave onset, that in
short time, and without any great loss they scaled the walls, and almost put
all to the edge of the sword, the Soldiers thus courageously having entr^d
combat, and won the conquest as before time they had done, entering into every
house to fetch out the spoil, general proclamation was made that no man upon
pain of death should take one penny, but that every one should return to the
camp, which so amaz^d and discourag^d ye mercenary men, that with hartlesse
groans they went straggling to the tents: the Senators entering the houses and
possessing such spoil, that they sent home Wagons laden with treasure to
Athens: After thus they had sacked the City, the Thebans hearing of this
victory, gathering their forces together, marched on to meet them, and in a
plain not far from Lisium gave them the encounter, with such desire to
revenge, as the Athenians were forced a little to retier: but Clytomaches,
whose courage no peril could daunt, encouraged his men, and for proo^e of his
own resolution, was foremost in the v^warde, laying on such blows, as he gave
witness how willing he was to be victor: the Senators likewise with eloquent
phrases sought to encourage: but to small purpose, for the soldiers warely
retiring, never stood stroke till they harbored them selves within the City,
where rampiring up the Gates like cowardes, they dishonored the forg^tten fame
and honor of Athens: The Thebans, whose teeth were set on edge with this
repulse, laid leagar to the walls and compassing the cit^y with a double
trench, thought either to make them issue out to the battle, or else to force
them yield by famyne: the soldiers careless, and heartlesse, would scarce
make defense on the walls, which the Senators seeing, one of them stepped up,
and calling them all into the market made them this oration.

Worthy Citizens and Soldiers of Athens, shall we be such cowardes as to
measure our thoughts by the favors of fortune, or resemble those bad hounds,
that at the first fault give over the chase, shall the fo^le of a little
skirmish affright those minds that hitherto have been invincible? shall
dishonor tear the Laurel from our heads which we have worn for so many
triumphs? shall the Thebans who have ever feared our forces, hold us begirt
as bondslaues within a city? shall y^ town which of late we subdued, be a
harbor for our selves against the enemy? shall I say the world canonize our
cowardice in y^ Records of infamy, that hitherto has imblazed our fame with
restless praises? No soldiers, and fellow companions in arms and in
fortunes, let this check be a spur to revenge, let us thirst with a passionate
desire till with conquest or an honorable death we win the glory we have
lost: our silver hairs, weakened in many forepassed battles ended, to the
honor of the Athenians, although they might be warrauntes of rest, shall not
privilege us from hazarding our selves amidst the thickest of our enemies: so
that encouraged, and as m^n resolved to die, or within the field you will with
us issue out to put these unskillful Thebans from their trenches. The soldiers
(so had ye discourteous couetize^ quatted their courage) as men not hearing,
slipped away murmuring, as malecon^ent: which Clitomaches espying, drawing forth
his sw^od, cried out unto them: how are you besotted sould^ers of ^thens? why
are your cares inchaunted that the wisdom of the Senate is holden frivolous?
For shame seek not after dishonor; behold, Clitomaches your captain will be
the first man that shall enter the trench of the enemy; t^is sword, this hand,
this heart companions shall forgard you, as more willing to die, then to brook
this discredit, and if you be so obstinate, take this blade and sacrifice my
blood, that dying I may shun that shame which for our ^owardice is like to
light on our heads: in vain did Clitomaches cry out, for the soldiers went
their way, and as melancholy men sat straggling and full of dumps in the
streets: long had they not been thus beelegard^ but that news was brought to
Roxander what mishap had fallen on his country: he whom injury nor death could
not withhold from wishing well to Athens, rather determined to hazard his life
by breaking the Ostracisme in returning from exile, then to be thought a
fearful and base minded cowarde: passing therefore with as much speed as
might be from Sicilia in poor and unknown attier, he landed in the
Promontorie of Lisium, within three leagues of the Camp: where he had not
wandered half a mile, but by the scowts, he was taken prisoner, and carried to
the Senat^ of Thebes, who thinking that Roxander was banished, took him for a
poor Sicilian, (as he feigned him self) and suff^ed him to remain quiet with
free liberty to pass and repasse at his liberty. Roxander continuing thus
amongst the Thebans, hearing that the City began to want victuales, and how
the Soldiers mutynous, were about to deliver up the City, despite of the
Senate upon composition: late in an evening getting close to the walls, called
to the watch and told them he had a letter to deliver from Roxander to the
soldiers of Athens: why villa^e (quoth the watchman) thou art mad, Roxander is
banished: Truth (quoth he) but returned, and taken prisoner by the Thebans,
who to morrow by eight of the Clock shall suffer death, if he be not set
free: for confirmation of my words deliver this letter to his Son, who
knowing his fathers hand, may both read it and witness it to the Soldiers:
the watchman hearing such sensible reasons to persuade him, took the letter;
and Roxander secretly stoale again^ to the Camp: No sooner did the morning
star and blushing Aurora begin to course her self from the bed of Ti^an^ but
^he watchman hied with the letter into the City, and sought out Roxanders
son, who was of no better account then a mercenary soldier, and to him
imparted the whole matter: who receiving the letter, ^ound that it was his
fathers writing: whereupon, taking the watchman with him, calling the Soldiers
by sound of a Trumpet, to the market place: he discoursed unto them, first
whose son he was: secondly what had past the last night between the
watchman and an unknown man, of his fathers imprisonment, and the speedines of
his death: for proof whereof he red them the letter as follows.

Roxanders Letter.
THe distress of my country bruted into Sicilia, where I lived poor and
exiled, such was the ear I had of the common wealth, as I choose rather to die
by breaking the law of the Ostracisme, then to be counted slack in attempting
what I might for the benefit af Athens. Honors are not tied to times, nor
courage to places: Death is sweeter then discontent, and more glorious is it to
perish in wishing well to Athens, then in lying quiet in Sicilia: The Thebans
have overcome, that greeues me not, since it is but a brave of Fortune, whose
favors are inconstaunt, whose frowns are mome^tany, whose check is the step
to good hap. The Athenians are vanquished; what of this? men are subject to the
pleasures of oportunities, their actions have not always prosperity favorable:
time changes: and more honor is gotten in a moment, than has been lost in a
month. The Athenians are rampired as cowardes within walls: this (country
men) pincheth Roxander at the heart, that famous Athens, renowned Athens,
Athens that was the chieftaine of Greece for warlike att^mpts, should be
stained with dishonor and cowardice: yea, countrymen and soldiers, Roxander in
bands in the hands of his enemies, ready to die, greeueth at this disgrace, and
blusheth more to hear the Thebans call you cowards, then to hear them
pronounce the sentence of death: Once worthy soldiers you sought to free me
from the hands of the Senate which were my friends: now seek to rid me from
the Thebans my foes, and your enemies, who intend to kill Roxander, only
because he is Roxander: whose liberality was ^he cause of your favors. This
if I obtain, I only in recompense, promise to be thankful. Farewell.

Roxander the friend to Athens.


NO sooner had his son red the letter, but that the soldiers showted at the
very name of Roxander, and pulling his son from ye place where he stood,
made him their Captain. The Senators h^aring this alarm, were driven into a
maze, till one of y^ Captains discoursed to them from point to point, the
forerehearsed premises: whereat being astonished, coming in with Clitomaches
into the market place, they found the Soldiers in arms, and in array ready to
march toward the gate of the City. Clitomache^ willing to stay the^ that
they might not issue out without advice, could not prevail: but breaking down
the rampires as mad men crying, Roxander, liberal Roxander, they issued out,
little looked for of the Thebans: who notwithstanding, standing within their
trenches in defense, the Athenians so valiantly gave y^ onset, that in a
desperate manner as in ^ contemnning death, they ran upon the pikes, and
presently discomfit^d th^enemy with such a s^aughter, as not one was left alive
to carry news to Thebes of their loss: the ret^aite sounded, Roxander
presented him self, whom with such loving submission they receiu^d and he
returning such lowly t^anks to the Soldiers, that they calling to rem^mbrance,
first the injury the Senators offered Roxander in his banishment, and their
wrong at the sack of Lisium, for division of spoil, that like men haunted
with a f^rie, running into the City, before Roxander could know the c^use of
the hurly burly, they so^ght out the Senators and Clitomaches, and put them to
the edge of the sword, presenting their heads to Roxander, who with tears
disalowing their disobedience, and with threats s^^wing him self discontent,
was nothstanding, maugre his teeth created again Dictator, in which estate he
lived long after in Athens.

Achilles Tragedy ^nded, ag^d Priamus standing up, gave his verdite upon
their discourse in this manner. Although, worthy Grecians, I am not called to
be a Judge in this controversy, yet friendly and freely let me say that such
a perfect division of qualities, or rather virtues, necessary and incident in a
soldier, has bin so lively pourtraied, and figured forth in such comely
colors, as it is hard to censure whether of them holds the supremacy: for
wisdom being the means do dispose the army in his due order, and to have an
in-sight by pollycie to prevent what the enemy can intend, yet is but a shadow
drawn with a pensell, unless fortitude and courage perform that in action,
which has been purposed and determined by wisdom: neither can these two have
long continuance, and good success, except liberality, as a linck to knit
these two in their forces, presents the minds of the soldiers captiuate by
their Captains bounty: then of these premises we may conclud^, that none can
come to ye perfection of a soldier, unless he be both wise, valiant, and
liberal: With this grave censure of Priamus, they res^ed all cont^nted, except
the Ladi^s, who seeing Phoebus so fast d^clining to the West, hastened on
Achilles to depart: he s^ttered with the love of Polixena, would willingly
have p^rswaded a nightly rest at Troy, but that his thoughts would have been
discerned: to pr^uent therefore ^ll occasions of suspicion, he made has^e, so
that taking his leave of Priam^s, Hector, and the rest of the kings and Pry^ces
resident at Troi^, mounting upon Horse he^ went with I^higenia and the Ladies
to their pauilions.
