THE BOOK TO THE READER.
MY Author for his Love, his Cost,
and virtuous (...),
Desires but Love for love
of you his Cour^eous Reader;
Whose Nature bountiful, I need not,
(nor is it my intent)
Here t'unfold; being known to all
to be magnificent;
The smaller that I seem in worth,
the greater is the praise
Of love in him, whose bounteous deeds
transcend desert always.
Greatness will show greatness ever,
and what so great as love?
Or what so much as gifts (of Grace)
does this grand virtue prove?
If reading in me, any good (perhaps)
you chance to find
Make use thereof, reteyne it well,
and love him for it in mind.
TO THE READER.
Courteous Reader.

IT is not so old as true, that Truth seeks (nay brooks) no Corners, though
Charity does; for (in a word) to prove them both legitimate, it is as bold
(with Discretion) as the other is modestly bashful; it may (for a time) be
blamed, but never shamed; suspected, but not quite dejected; trodden on, but
not destroyed; eclipsed, but not extinguished; no, 'twill rise, and shine forth
again; comparable it is, and alike effectual to the glorious Sun,
commanding his entrance (upon least advantage) through the thickest Clouds into
the darkest Dungeon; where a good sight receives his light at a little hole,
and rejoices in it.

This short Treatise following (in part) expounds my meaning, being of a Voyage
I made unto the EastIndi^s almost twenty years since, employed by the
Honorable Company; prosperously begun, and as well continued (notwithstanding
some prime opposition) with all good proceeding in grace and favor with the
best; which at length (as has happened unto many of best report) upon (...) of
government there, proved to my greater prejudice, but how? Is no par cell of
this discourse; yet notwithstanding, seeing that by one finger the whole hand
may be proportioned, and by the foot the entyre body drawn out; I held it
requisite (for good respects) this way to declare my self, and at this time
especially; as high time (among many other observations more general and
delightful) in such brief passages as seemd to me most considerable, and
(without all offense or prolixity unto any) to my purpose material; that the
honorable Company themselves, or any else of judgment (with content and
pleasure in the sweet variety, and mild composure of matter) might from
thence (accidently, or by the way only) make a near conjecture at the true
cause of my neglect there, and untimely departure thence, to their preiudize as
my own, which here (in modesty) I silence.

Having finished my Travayles, I made bold (in a plain Epistle) to dedicate
them unto the Honorable Company, as most convenient me thought; but it
pleased them not to accept thereof, for reasons to themselves best known;
which I suppose (for I hope the best) they might intend, (or it may so fall
out) to my advantage; for look how many courteous Readers, both of themselves
and others (to whom in general I make my Dedi^ation) so many generous Patrons;
not with sword and spear, but with fair speech to countenance, or excuse
these my honest (though not much profitable) labors; for gentle deeds and
words (more then staves or swords) prevail with men.

It was so full of love, my lost Dedication I mean (briefly preferred to all
other graces, as holding the precedent room in every grace and virtue, moral
and divine; compared likewise to fire, fine gold and silver of the finest; and
made illustrious by Pearls, Diamonds, and Precious stones, (yet all
vndervallued as trifles unto him or her, in whom this divine Grace of Graces
dwells, as being richer then all riches, supplying all wants, healing all
infirmities, and sweeter also (in its blessed effects) then Honey and the Honey
comb) with a reason (in a word or two) for conclusion, of this my elevation,
or improper digression) that it grieves me (gentle Reader) so rich an
ingemination should be lost, rich (at least) in my own conceit, and fondlings
would feign have their fancies, though reason say nay) lost, (I say) from
public use, though with my self it shall remain a perpetual memorial of my
constant love, and due respect toward them for ever, in whose honorable
employments I improued my slender parts to my low degree of a mean
sufficiency.

My History it self (courteous Reader), here at hand attends thy leisure, and
craves thy patience, at most but an hour or two, to survey her parts; if
perhaps (at first report) they answer not thy expectation, as things too
common, and already past the press; let not this divert thee from that honest
recreation which (in one respect or other) may please or prosit thee; full
furnished Tables (like great Volumes) at their only sight (we see) ^loy good
stomachs, whereas a less quantity incites the appetite. lo vedado es
desseado, things retired are the more desired; and the same meats diversely
dressed have different effects, attract new desires; what one likes not, another
longs for; and that which surfeits thee, may (perhaps) give life to me; lo que
vno no come, otro se pierde por ello. Let nothing therefore, (Gentle Reader) be
despised in this my short variety, whereunto I most lovingly invite thee;
taste and spare not, what likes thee best, and to others commend, or leave the
rest.

Vale.

CAlling to mind my former Travels, and the fit Occasion offered me thereby, a
little to communicate my self unto the world, by a brief relation of such
short passages and observations therein taken, as may minister matter of some
Recreation to the universal Reader, from his more serious studies and affairs
of importance, be they whatsoever; variety or change (though in the meanest of
things not unlawful) with some Novelties especially, being that (says
experience) which in all, or in most men begets delight, aliuiates the minds
of the wisest, and prepares them (upon a return) with advantage, to a better
sufficiency in their weightiest negotiations; not unlike a Bow that stands
always bent, becomes weak in it self, and unserviceable to others: so fares
it alike with the most ingenious minds to be still engaged, without some
intermissions, some steppings aside, though but after a slye, or a feather in
the air, to breath, to reviue our oversad, our too intensiue spirits; As once
the riding of a hobbyhorse with his little princely son, not ill beseem'd a
King; any sport for a spurt, (if honest or harmless, though childish)
contradi^ts not the Reputation of a Man; It being a point of wisdom sometimes
(among the unwise) to seem to play the fool, as to do it understandingly,
requires (they say) the best wits; of purpose to forget, improues the very Art
of memory; the way (in some cases) to advance forward, is by a learned skill
to retire back; and by a discreet retreat, no small advantage is gotten; the
day, the Field is ofttimes won; so the reading of a Pamphlet, a shallow, a
despised work of puffed conceits, proves not only not hurtful, but beneficial
to the Wise (who suckes advantage from every thing) a help in his progress to
his most serious intendments, be it but for change, for recreation, for
variety sake only, as I have said.

And what is there so mean (if of any moment, in the judgments of the best)
but in one respect or other, a man of a gracious wit will make some gracious or
moral use thereof to his own behoof and others, extracting Juice out of a
dry Iuncke; sweet out of sour; honey out of gall; preservatiue out of poison;
and Documents of Wisdom from Examples of Folly; but this is a prerogative of
Virtue, and peculiar to the wise only; a Task too hard for all, and positions
abhorred by men of honesty, such as are not to be expected in the little
garden plot of my ensuing discourse, which shall bear no noisome weeds, but
(at least) harmless, (if not wholesome) herbs and flowers, though (in
comparison) of all other the meanes^* for any that will, to make a Nose-gay to
smell to on a Holiday; a vacant hour, a Festival, a time of leisure.

I have therefore made choice (before the rest) to write of my Travels only to
the East Indies, as well for brevity as for raritie (for to speak of all I
have seen abroad would (I know) seem no less tedious then common and
ridiculous, things far fot, and dear bought have bin counted best and in
most request) wherein I shall not be overcurious, or too remiss to satisfy
the indifferent Reader, nor yet to leave the most judicious (I hope) void of
all content; none that will not, would I willingly should (as not to surfeit; so
neither) to go fasting away, if short syppets in a forreyne Feast, o^an Indian
Collation homely dressed, and by an unskillful hand hastily set forth, may (for a
moment or so) either entertain their curious sight, or relish their judicious
taste.

Thus by a choice pittance, a modicum, a Spanish Bocado, a bit and away,
carefully purveying to recreate the best, and to prevent disorder in the rest;
however, be it gustfull or not, this benefit (to the wise) will surely follow,
as to provoke the sooner to relinquish or leave off, quicken an appetite unto
better things, and leave the mind content to have made a gainefull exchange by
a refresht return.

Upon a time discoursing with my self about the fickle Condition of worldly
Estates, presented daily, and almost every where to my observation; some to
rise and others to fall, the same men again to fall, and in like sort to rise
(man's Industry the subordinate, and Gods overruling Providence the prime Cause,
and superintendent Agent in all; we vainly purposing, he alone wisely
'disposing even of all things, making them work together (contrary to their
own natures, and the intentions both of Men and Devils) for the best to them
that love him (O thrice happy and blessed Estate of a resolute Soul loving and
beloved of GOD) none so firmly standing but subject to a declension,
accidental or final; by a decay of wealth, or at longest an expiration of our
breath.

And having before bin well Disciplined and confirmed in these and other like
Points of Faith. That who so lives unto the Lord shall dye in the Lord; and all
such (whether (so) living or dying) are sure to be the Lords, securely
sleeping and waking under his Omnipotent, his merciful, and ever-watchfull
protection; As also, that the way to Heaven lay parallel by Sea as by Land, as
near from the East as from the West, from the North as from the South; from
whence I had read should be gathered all the Elect of God in CHRIST, which (in
effect) I remember was my answer to Sir Thomas Smith then Governor, obiecting
unto me the danger of the enterprise, with his cheerful approbation
following.

Hereupon it came into my thoughts, and thence (by degrees) grew into a
resolution to attempt a Voyage into those Oriental or Eastern parts of the
world, as well (to speak after the manner of men) in hope to raise my Fortunes,
as to better my Experience, which doubtless I had obtained to the full of my
desires, had not God seen contrary things more expedient for me; for a fair
way (as ever unto any of a mean rank that went that way) was laid open to me,
which some of good note observing, pronounced me openly (by their
Prognostication) to be certainly some great rich man before I dyed; which (for
their rash Oaths sake, and the better expression of my bountiful mind, the
only portion (to any purpose) I ever yet possessed, a large heart and an open
hand to my Friend, or Foe in misery) I could wish may yet come to pass, and
why not? (without offense) as well as others? so it may stand with Gods glory,
and not to the wrong of any; else welcome still (be it whatsoever) the good
pleasure of the Almighty.

For Friends of neither kiffe nor kin were raised up unto me, ready to
engage themselves by speaking and doing for me whatsoever might, and did
procure me Credit with the Governor and Committees, even unto bonds; whose
love and merit I shall be ever pressed (to my power) upon all occasions, (change
they or change they not) to requite and honor; by whose means my Parentage
was honored; my parts commended; and (upon trial) both in private conference,
and in full Courts openly approved; my sallary was assigned me; my place
appointed; and in them both made equal (at least) with many of my betters.

In fine, there was nothing wanting on the honorable Companies part or my
Friends behalf, that might abode unto me all wished prosperity, but that (in
some others) which (for loue^ sake) I am willing in silence to pass over, as
also to shun all impertinent, and supersluous matter, though the only
stumbling-blocke in the way of my so fair proceedings to my future Preferments
then; and (in effect, as originally) ever since; for love, (I am taught) covers
a multitude of Infirmities, but vncovers none.

Briefly then, to shut up my Introduction, and to the matter it self; All
things being in readines^e, and prepared for our intended Voyage, the Companies
Orders with our Commission sealed up and sent aboard; yards a cross, and a
fair wind, that now it is time to prosecute my purpose, and to lanch forth into
the deepes.

Our Fleet (therefore) consisted of Four good Ships, viz. The Newyeares gift,
and the Hector; the Merchants Hope, and the Solomon; which together set sail
from the ^ownes, about the Ninth of March, 1613. of burden from three hundred
to 8. hundred Tonnes, completely furnished (besides private Provisions) with
varieties for health and preservation of life; warlike appointed though
peaceably intended, in a fair and generous way of Trading, howeuer report may
wrong our Reputation.

Our General, or chief Commander, an understanding Gentleman, Captain
Nicolas Downton, whose religious Orders, (besides the honorable Companies) both
for divine duties* and civil society, published and hung up in every ship,
with his own good Example (no doubt) prevented many gross offenses, which
usually happen in promiscuous multitudes.

Our Merchants or Factors were many, well nigh thirty, and most of them men of
Experience as ever the Company employed any; Linguists, and Residents in
foreign Countries; as Turki^, Barbary, Spain, and Italy, with other places
of best co^merce, whereof four were Principals, and had each his several
charge and respect next unto the General, save in Marine affairs, wherein the
Masters only commanded; their names, Master William Edwards, Master Nicolas
Ensworth, Master Thomas Elkington, and Master Edward Dodsworth; he alone more
bred a Gentleman then a Merchant, and our Gover^ours Kinsman.

Our ordinary means to stir up men's affections to goodness, as Prayer and
divine Service twice a day, on the Sabbaths especially, and choice of good
Books (in common) of the Companies providing to that end (to the comfort of
all) were not wanting; besides a Preacher in his monthly visites, for
Instruction, and Ministration of the Sacrament.

Our places of refreshing were three, the first Cape boon Speranc^, which
affoorded us plenty of Booes and Baas, or Beeues and Sheep for small pieces of
Copper, whereof the Saluages make themselves Rings and Bracelets; they go all
naked, save only before, a little flappe; and feed (as they look and smell)
most nastily; subtle they are, theevish, and very treacherous; their Houses
are like Bee-hives, and many together make a Town, wherewith (upon occasion of
changing their herds to fresh pastures, or the sight of two or three Muskets,
whereat they tremble) away they skuddle (every one his Castle on his back)
posting to a new Plantation.

From hence, having repaired our Flee^e, refresht our selves, and strecht our
limbs (he that listed) to the very tops of the highest Mountains and craggie
Rocks, which (for our pains) discovered unto us a goodly Country, extending
far in length and breadth, in lower Hills and green Valleys running on
together, pleasant to behold; yet always in company more or fewer, and with
our Arms, (least the Baboones out of some Thicket or bush should suddenly
surprise us) at the end of three weeks or thereabouts we set sail again,
and not long after came to an Anchor at Saint Lawrence Island, in the Bay of
Saint Augustine.

Here we landed and traded three days with the people, and had large and fat
Oxen for five shillings an Ox, most curious Darts and of diverse fashions as
Art could make, and bright as silver, for half a Ryall or Threepence, but
without silver we could have nothing, which they knew from counterfeit as well
as any; we saw no Town nor house they had, though (doubtless) better then
the Soldanians provided, by good conjectures, for their carriage had a gloss
of humanity, a tincture of understanding; their persons full of proportion and
comely feiture; tall, straight, strong, and sturdy; fierce of Countenan^;
admirable ma^kesmen at the Dart, and active; very fair and black as Iett
(for the blackest they count the fairest) and all naked as the former, (perhaps
but servants to their Lords and Masters;) many were desirous to have made some
discovery into the Country, but we durst not contradict our Orders, nor hazard
the danger of a thick Wood, whereof we knew no end; which of necessity must
have bin past.

Our last touch was at Socato^, where we found a King; not a Native, but of
the royal blood of the ancient Kings of Barbary; who got this small Island by
Conquest, and held the Natives in great servitude, whom our General
presented, and would have entertained aboard the Ships, but he refused it;
yet for three or four days space, came down daily to the water side from his
Castle, with his guard of soldiers borne in a Palanquine, and after the Moorish
fashion (crosse-legged) sitting in state under a rich Cannopie upon Turkey
Carpets spread on the ground, and as richly clad in cloth of Gold, conuerst in
the Arabeck and Portugal tongues, with the General, Merchants, and Masters
both of Marchandizing and Nauigating affairs (himself being a Merchant, as
likewise all the Kings of those Eastern parts, who trade by their Agents and
Factors) of whom we bought a good quantity of Aloes Socatrina, even his whole
store; and in the Art of Navigations, Astronomy, with other branches of the
Mathematickes (by report of those that understood) very judicious; having
celestial and terrestrial Globes, his Instruments and Astralabe about him to
show us, which he had gotten (bought or presented) of former Fleets, and every
year increasing his stock by English, Dutch, Portugals, and Spanish that came
that way; A man of a lively countenance and well favored; about forty years
of age; as full of Courtesy and affability as might stand with his Majesty,
and as full of Majesty (respecting his Commodity) as might be, for he was a
Kingly Merchant, and a Marchant-like King; at parting he gave amongst v^ (to
some in particular) abundance of Dates in heaps and lumpes, which made our
Guisados, our brothes and Dumplins so much the sweeter, whom again we
gratified from the ships with our Seamusicke, great Gunnes and Trumpets.

And thus weying and setting sail again (with starbord and larboord; port and
helm al^e) we steered on our Course, till with the help of God, and our
constant Monsoone, or westerly trade wind, we very happily (but hardly)
recovered the Rendeuous to S^rat, and came to an Anchor in the Road of Swall^e,
about the tenth, of November, and of our great Company (thanks be to God)
lost only one man, who came sick of an Ague out of England, but here quickly
they began to dye faster of Fluxes and Feauers.

Upon advise of our arrival, by a dispatch to Surat, some eight miles up into
the Country, Mr. Thomas Aldworth the Companies chief Agent there, an
understanding Gentleman and once Sheriff of the City of Bristoll, came down
to us a joyful man, and for many enterchangeable causes was as joyfully
received, and with him Coach and horse for conuoy of the Merchants to the City,
for now the Term (or vintage rather) after our long Vacation, approaching, we
must leave the ships a a while, and apply our selves to Landseruice.

In our short Journey upon the way, every thing almost seemed new unto me, the
people with their customs especially, not the Moors (for I had seen of them
before in Spain and Barbary) but the ancient natives of the Country, called
Banians, who (notwithstanding their different Religions) live ciuillie,
neighbour-like one among another, in Cities, Towns, and Villages (but not in
Houses) together, whom (in Concourse) we first saw at Swallie, the first mile
from the water side, where the Mocodam or Constable received us, proffered us
his own, with the Towns service, and performed it in such necessaries and
complements of provision as we required, or would accept off; Bread, Wine,
Plantines, Taddie, and such like Regalos y^ scanty place affoorded; wherewith
more delighted the^ refresht (as with nouelty and variety) we set onward
through an even and a solitary way till we came in sight of Surat, and of a
Nauigable river which ran close under the Town walls, upon which within, stood
a Castle (a good ornament to the place) and fortified with men and munition.

This River we past, and landed right before the Alfondica, or Custom house,
and so along through many streets (humming like Bees in swarms) with
multitudes of people in white Coats, men and women; (close bodied, and full of
gathering to the mid-leg) with breeches and stockings in one, ruffling like
boots and all of one single Callico; this being their General and most neat,
or Angelical habit, which sparkles (of their kind of starching) like silver
spangles; until (almost smothered with clouds of heat and dust) we come to
the English house a day or two after Master Aldworthes return from the Shippe^
with the prime Merchants, where we found our selves as at home, in all
respects well accommodated save lodging, which with breuity was very
commodiously supplied, by taking another house with an Orchard and pleasant
walks upon the roof (after the Spanish and the Moorish building) to our rich
content, having Chambers, Diet, Servants, Coach and Horse with attendance of
Indians called Peones, for the way, and all at our honorable Masters charge
except our Apparel, wherein alone, and by our sallaries we differd from common
Prentises, only (yet ingeniously) acknowledging a precedencie in our little
Common weal, for a kind of representation to prevent confusion.

But now, before I proceed (being called upon by order) I am willing (for more
variety) to entertain a while my Courteous Reader with a short discourse of my
self and another, being not a whit impertinent, but r^ther a good Compliment,
if not a comely ornament to the History it self, how that in few days I here
suddenly fell sick of a burning Fever, and (thanks be to God) as suddenly
recovered; for fearing the extremi^y of that raving and uncomfortable
Sick^esse, (against his will) I prevayl^d wi^h our Ch^rurgion, to let me bleed
till I fainted again, as foreseeing it to be my remedy; appl^ed all
comfortable things to my h^ad; took my bed; and (full of perplexity to dve
senseless) I commended my self to God; after some idle talk to my friends
about me, I fell into a slumber, but quickly wakened by a desire to ease my
stomach, and had (at least) a dozen vomits, naturally, which gave me a most
comfortable night; turned my great sorrows into the greater reioycings, at the
lively apprehension of Gods infinite mercies; made me forthwith an instrument
of comfort to another that shortly after of a bloody Flux sickened and dyed;
by such words and warrants from the word of truth and my own experience of
inward Celestial Joys beyond expression, to honest hearts and heavenly
minds, that won me his earnest attention (to his and my own advantage, for
I applied him the closer) which took so deep an impression in him, that it
left him not to his last breath.

To mention all circumstances and passages of his six days sickness, would
seem a needless curiosity, which (in comparison of some then languishing and
repining under the same Cross) he suffered with singular patience, and spent
it most in abstinence, silence, and meditation; the night before his death, in
private conference, watching with him, he told me (after his accustomed
mildness) he had thought of my former talk, and should find my Words true;
the next morning (upon my persuasion) he r^ceived the Sacrament, after he had
made his Will in the presence of another Merchant and my self; one Master
Edward Hamden; wherein (in effect, having his memory perfect to the last) he
would (more then once or twice) have given me his whole E^tate, being of some
value I remember, but excusing my self (with thanks for his love) I refused
it, as not expedient for my self (me thought) in regard of the work in hand,
though lawful (I knew) for another, least Religion should suffer, and my labor
of love be thought merc^narie, whereof (God knows) I was exceeding jealous,
to prevent occasion, or the least prejudice in any, the sick man especially.

After all this, having tasted some comfortable broth I caused to be made for
him by our English Cook, he presently fell into aswound, thinking all he had
been dead, but after a while reviving, raised himself up, and looked
earnestly round about the Chamber, being full of good Company, Merchants and
others, whereof our Preacher was one, at least a dozen, with some Strangers, as
our Indian Doctor, etc. and fixing his eyes upon me, beckened me to him with
his hand; I went and sat close by him on his Bed; he presently caught me in
his Arms and hugged me (not like a dying man) with such strength and
unutterable expressions of Joy (between ^peech and speechless) that moved
passion in all, but my self especially to drown him in tears; as, Ah my
Friend, my Friend; my true, my happy, my faithful friend: and ah the joys!
the joys, the joys; Aah, Aah, Aah, and the like: flung away his things about
him, wherein (he said) he had taken too much delight, in token how slightly he
now valued them or the whole world; reached forth his hand to all the company,
lifting his eyes on high with an overjoyed countenance, where his mind in
silence had been long before.

And thus (in a blessed peace) about 9. of the Clock on a Wednesday morning,
being the 23. of November, 1614. he took his last farewell of this wretched
life, and changed it (no doubt) for a better: his name Master Timothy Wood, a
young man, and once a Mercer (I think) in Cheap Side, but then a Factor for the
Honorable East India Company: What I have written I fear not to be censured,
because God knows this my Relation (in substance) to be true, and not for
mine, but for his own glory, (the only blessed Author of all goodness) have I
now at length penned it, and for the good of any that can make use thereof.

My sad Story (of a Joy Tryumphant) being ended, and the Funerals performed, I
am called upon to a further relation of our Journey up within the Country, to
make provision of goods for best and speediest returns home unto our honorable
Masters, to which end, it was ordained in Consultation, that by a distributio^
of our Company into four Squadrons, the prime Cities or Marts for Commodity,
Trade, and Commerce of that rich Kingdom should be invested by us, as Baroch
and Brodera; Amadavaz and Cambaya, each in distance at least a days journey
one from another; our Commodities were diverse, as sundry sorts of Stones;
Aggate Cupps of curious Art^;* Quilts, Conserves, Drugges, Cotton Wools, and
(for bulk or gross lading) Indicoes and Callicoes.

Our first Journey or place of rest from Surat, was Baroch, being three days
on the way, much toyled with heat and dust, in regard of our slow proceedings
with our heavy carriages, and the toylesome passage of two Rivers with ladings
and reladings of our goods; (interruptions and stays being worse then a
continual progress) but here we were well refresht at the English house, for
Master John Oxwicke a Spanish Merchant being appointed chief for that place,
and of a weeks antiquity before, had made good provision for our coming, as
well for our persons as the dispatch and clearing our charge of the
Custom House.

From hence within a day or two we^ set forth, and by slow Iournies (as before)
came to Brodera, a dry^r place (by a great River) but the greater City, and
all a plain and pleasant Country ( Baro^h esp^cially) for Orchards, Tankes or
Ponds, very spacious, and artificially made, (in form, for work and
workemanshippe not unlike our Bathes) for general use and uses; Tombs, and
Piramides many in open Fields (and private Gardens) about which are to be seen
certain Penitentiaries, or votari^s (they say) but Lunatickes and men (I
think) really possessed with Devils, as in the Gospel is mentioned; their
bodies naked, cut, and lanced with knives or stones, staring and stalking, to
and fro, no less woeful then dreadful to behold; as was also the sight of a
Pagot, or a Cell of devotion descending into a Vault under ground, where (being
desirous of discoueries) we saw an ugly Idol against a wall, representing (it
seems) their God, or their fear, but a plain Devil as we call it, in like
form painted or graven, whom a certain Sect of Banians do worship, whereof
there are many Sects, but of this no more, Purchase Pilgrimage from relation of
exact Travelers has them lively set forth.

In this City, as all others throughout both Asia's and Afrique we were lodged
in the Ceragl^, a spacious place made of purpose for all Travelers, Natives as
else (for they have not the use of Innes as in Christendom) with commodious
Warehouses round about, of one Story, four Square, in the manner of Galleries;
and under them dry walks and places to feed their Coach-oxen, Camels,
Elephants, and Horses, but in the middle all open, like our Exchange; It being
supposed that every Merchant, Gentleman, or Nobleman has his Tent or Coach to
sleep in, if neither, they make the best shi^t they can, and for their
provision they bring it with them, or buy it in the Town.

Here it was determined by a Consultation, for causes or supposals moving them
(being before appointed for Cambaya) that my self should go back to Bar^ch
to assist Master Oxwicke there, in that main investment of C^licoes, having a
Commission given me beyond my expectation or desire, that (in case of the
least cause by unequal carriage in our Masters business, or in particular
toward my self, being persuaded, (as they told me) that if he would take the
matter well, or live peaceably with any, I was the man) a word from my hand
should displace him; such an opinion they all seemed to have of my Integrity,
and he no less on the other side, assured of me; for (concealing whatsoever
might move passion, or incite him to Jealousy, I applied my self to him by
Complements of love and friendly (...), till he became so well possessed of me
both for Judgment and Honesty, upon some experiences of them both, that (in
effect) he made me his Secretary, and would not write a Letter of Consequence
in his own affairs (as occasions there were between him and some others of
principal note) without my advice and allowance for a pass; wherein (I thank
God) I never fayl'd but pleasured him, by his own often ingenious
acknowledgements, with good reasons for his satisfaction.

But yet all this while I am still in Brodera, in the house of a rich Banian
well lodged and entertained for three days, till he had procured me from the
Governor Mosaph Cha^, or Lord Mosaph, a Guard of Soldiers under a Captain of
ten, both horse and foot, with shot and lance for my safe Convoy to Baroch,
our English Friends being all gone forward, and my self alone with a kinsman
of his own for my linguist and Coachmate, and not without cause, for my Coach
on the way was suddenly stayed by a Company of sl^ues that thwarted us, but
speedily rescued by my guard, with knockes on both sides, yet no hurt on ours,
and all with such celerity that I had scarce time to draw my sword and show my
self a party before they were quite vanished; then on again we went merrily,
(my Banian especially) laughing and talking, giving and eating of our Iunkets
till we came near to the City; there I dismissed my valliant Soldiers,
gratified their desert with a small reward, yet to their rich content, and at
parting had a general Salam of them, or Congee to the ground, with a short
Vollie, and adieu.

And now being come to Baroch, to the English house, my friend bids me lovingly
welcome, to whom I gave my Letters from our Cape Merchants, and (after
colation) showed him my general commission, who presently declared himself,
that seeing the matter must be so, he was right glad of my company, as of one
whom of all others, he would have made choice of for his friend and associate;
and thus, well possessed of each other, on we went together in our Masters
business, buying Callicoes as fast as we could procure our Brokers to bring us
in good Bargains, or direct us to them, spending our interims of Vacation for
about two Months space as best liked us; sometimes in visites to the
Governor; sometimes taking our Coach to breath the Country ayr^; sometimes
walking upon the City walls, which from that stately situation gave us a
goodly prospect pregnant for delight and Meditation; and lastly, our own
House, having high and pleasant Tarasses or Walks on the Roof, for domesticke
Recreation; that in this pleasant place (in number four English) we lived like
Lords, to the honor and profit of our Honorable Masters, and to our own
hearts content, save a little Jar that fell out at last, about a parcel of
Calicoes, but lovingly and honestly reconciled again.

By this time, our general investments drawing to a period, and most of our
goods from all parts sent aboard, Marchantlike made up and marked as in the
Margent; and understanding our dispersed Companies and friends to be again
united, and on the way toward us (save such as were appointed for the great
Mogores Court; namely, Master Edwards, our Preacher, and some others) we could
no less (having now leisure enough) but set forth to meet them; it being a
pleasant observation (at a distance) to note the order of their Coaches and
Carriages, drawn by two fair fat Oxen a piece, with Bells about their necks,
Iinge, Iinge, and softly iogging on; extending all in length like a Teeme, (for
the way admits no familiarity) inveloped with a Cloud of dust (for a Quita Sol)
to shield them from the Sun; and guarded on either side, with swords, half
Pikes and Targets; small shot, Bows and Arrows, etc. As if (presented to a
Novelist) it had bin the spoils of a Triumph leading Captive, or a preparation
to some sad Execution.

Being all met together, we generally salute one another, and each his friend
in particular, with mutual congratulations, for our good success and safe
returns thus far; having lost but one (as I remember) a young Gentleman,
Master Henry Smith, Nephew to Sir Thomas Smith our Governor, who dyed of a
bloody Flux at Amadavas, being a prime youth and much lamented; and here
unawares (as many light on ill Bargains) I over-hastily changed my horse for a
Coach, and took his place that left it, to confer with my friend and
familiar acquaintance, Master Ralph Preston, a Religious Gentleman; and quite
forgetful of his mishap out ward bound, I fell into the very same, by letting
one Leg hang out of the Coach, and (in talk) moving it to and fro, the
Wheel caught it, which my friend perceiving, he presently cried out to stay
the Coach, Rack Rack, as Master Henry Smith had done before for him, which
saved both our Legs from breaking, but did rend my heel, which for a Week so
tormented me, that I could scarce take rest, yet (thanks to God for a good
flesh) soon well again, but could not travayle in a Fortnight after, nor
scarce then, save in a Palanquine to Surat.

And thence aboard the Ships again, scarce cold yet of the Portugals blood, by
means of a late cruel fight in our absence, occasioned by the Portugals, who
(with six Gallions, or great Ships of War, two Gallyes, and sixty Frigates)
suddenly surprised the Marchants-Hope, which was deep and richly laden for
England, not doubting to have taken her as she lay at Anchor with the rest, in
that unexpected manner cutting their Cables by the Halser, and with a strong
Current of the Tide forcing in upon her; but were soundly beaten for their
haste; for in laying her aboard on all parts with throngs of men and fresh
supplies, the Master and Company being vigilant and valiant, stoutly resisted;
gave them so hot entertainment that their legs and arms were sent flying into
the Air, and the Ship pestered with their dead and dying bodies, scorched and
wounded with weapons and fire-workes, and their blood issuing out the Scupper
holes into the Sea, as not willing to abide their fury; by this time the rest
of our Fleet had likewise cut their Cables, and were under Sail, increasing
the fight a long time (by report with los^e but of two or three of our men)
till they had made such a slaughter amongst them (the Frigates especially) that
their dismembered bodies after they had breathed their last, with shrikes and
cries in the Conflict, lay floting on the Sea, and coveting the Shore, were
taken up daily for many days, by the Port^gal Inhabitants, and the Indians for
their spoil; and the r^st unable to hold out, away they went with no l^sse
shame and loss of former reputation, then perpetual honor to our English
Nation, through out the Indies.

The next tidings that I heard, (being now again in the Fleet with the rest,
expecting our further passage to the Southward, according to the Companies
Commission) was a Messenger from our General, or chief Commander, tha^ I must
come to sp^ake with him: Aboard the Admiral I went, a little limping of my
late hurt, and being come, he receyved me with courtesy, took me apart into
the Gallery, and (to be brief) told me that for such and such reasons, the
Council had determined of me for Surat, and therefore wished me to provide for
the Shore, namely (with leave of modesty I speak it) for the good opinion they
had justly conceived of me, to be a friend of trust unto Master Aldworth, and
an aid unto our Masters affairs, occasioned by some refractorie fugitives
that not long before our arrival (to make a purchase) had attempted his death,
being forced into his chamber (a weakly man) to stand upon his guard to
preserve his life. All which did not a little cheer me up, and quicken in me a
Noble resolution unto my charge, though incredibly thenceforth (as from God to
keep me exercised I think) from time to time opposed by some fire brand^,
some seditious Malcontents or other, repi^ing my respect, to my great
discour^gement, and no small sufferings, notwithstanding my best endeavors and
dese^t, which doubtles^e stirred them the more, and increased my own sorrows;
for wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous, but w^o is able to stand before
Envy ^ Pro. 27. 4.

Few day^s after this, (at last parcing) I went aboard again to take my leave
of the General, and (not without open demonstrations of his love, tears and
embracements) having commended him and his whole proceedings to the blessing of
the the Divine providence, I left him; and with my good wishes to all the rest,
in company with our Factorie went ashore to Surat; having had but few nights
before, a dream, that in my passage for Bantan, two sturdy Knaves grapled with
me to have heaved me over-boord, but in the conflict (to save my self) I
awaked, and finding it but a Dream was glad.

Here for a Month or two, wanting no leisure, we spent our time at Surat,
every man as (with approbation) best liked him; sometimes within doors,
sometimes abroad; now with our provision visiting this garden, now that
Orchard; to day fresh Rivers; to morrow open feilds and fair Monuments,
whereof there are store, but always (after the Countries custom) in Coach or
on Horse to prevent disgrace; our recreation for the most part, Bow and
arrows, and free from all molestation of the Inhabitants; a mixed people,
quiet, pe^ceable, very subtle; civil, and universally gou^rned under one
King, but diversely law'd and customed; their grain is Wheat, for the better;
Rice, and diverse kinds else for the common sort; their provision of other
victual is Beeues and Buffeloes; sheep and goats; young kidde and hens in
abundance, and of little value for the great pl^nty, and fewenesse of eaters;
for the Banians of whatsoever sect (being half the Inhabitants, and the
ancient Natives of the Kingdom) by their Laws eat no kind of flesh, nor any
thing that hathlife in it; nor dae they kill any thing (for their lives) though
never so venomous or hurtful, no not a Mouse nor a louse, but will rather feed
them; their greatest cruelty is to lay it down, and let it shift for it self;
(O happy Creatures that breed amongst the Banians) a kind of Rechabits also,
for they never drink wine, nor any strong drink, but water only, yet so fat
and sleeke that they shine again; Confectuaries of all sorts, as Sugar-Cakes,
and March-panes; Suckets and Marmelades; Rice, Pulse, and other Grain stewed
with Butter and Spices after their most savorie fashion, is there only
feeding; but the Moors and Mahometanes, more at liberty, for they abstain
from nothing but Swines flesh, which is a cause that many parts of the Country,
even whole Fields do swarm with them; these drink wine liberally, and strong
waters, yet never drunk but in the Night, and then their women, their Wives
and Concubines (whereof they are stored according to their states) sing most
melodiously, with such elevated and shrill voices, strayned unto the highest,
yet sweet and tuneable, rising and falling according to their art and skill,
(for every Country has his own, and more or less excelling) that I have been
ravished in those silent seasons with the sweet Echo, or reflection thereof
from a fair distance, and kept waking hours together, listening to them;
anticipating (in my desires) the new Moons, which they constantly thus
celebrate; for the Heavenly representation thereof (me thought) where commonly
my meditations had their end.

For at like times especially (though superstitiously) they observe, (or rather
profane) these and the like ceremonies, sing aloud unto God our strength, make
a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob, take a Psalm and bring hither the
Timbrell, the pleasant Harp with the Psalterie; blow up the Trumpet in the new
Moon, in the time appointed on our solemn Feast Day; again, praise the Lord
with Harp, sing unto him with the Psalterie, and an Instrument of Ten strings,
sing unto him a new song, play skilfully with a loud voice; again, O clap your
hands all ye people, (both Men and Women in their Himnes and Dances) shout
unto God with the voice of Triumph; then they anoint their heads with Oil,
and their cups run over; making their faces also to shine with costly
Ointments and odoriferous, at first sight or news of the new Moon, which they
congratulate with great joy, the slave to his Lord, the servant to his Master,
and one friend to another, A l^ Espan^ol^ erying Albricias, Albricias, a reward
for our watchfulness or good tidings.

Their chief recreation is riding of Horses swift and active, for discipline
and service, with Lance, Bow, and Target, whereof they abound, and have very
good, not inferior to the Spanish lennet; but their Princely sport is hunting
the wild Bore and Antelope, peculiar to the King, his Nobles, and Gentry; a
people throughout of mighty estate or wealth, yet all subject (in a moment) to
the spoil, or to be restored, at the pleasure of their Prince; full of
Majesty in their port, and no less of expectation for respect; sumpteous in
their buildings; curious in their Orchards, and Gardens, beautified with
Artificial Ponds, Fountains, and Water-workes; populous in their attendance;
rich in attire; imperious Lords over their Servants; and cruel in their
corrections: having also both for state and War, abundance of Elephants, which
likewise they use for their Iourneyes as Sumpter horses, and to carry their
Women and Children, twenty (perhaps) in a frame of Timber (Castle-like) upon
his Back, with windows and small pieces of Ordnance planted forward and
backward (the Country being full of Thieves, and dangerous) and upon his brawny
neck (Monkie-like, of same bigness with his head, or bigger) sits a man
astride in full breadth with a hook in his hand like a sickle, for a Bridle,
and a Spur to guide and stay him, which is done with the least touch of the
sharp point upon his Noale, whereof he is very tender; has a body like a
house, but a Tail like a Ratte, erecting it like a Cedar; little eyes but
great sight; very melancholy but wise (they say) and full of understanding,
(or subtilty rather for a beast) sometimes they become madd, (of what I know
not) and breaking loose endanger multitudes; is fed somewhat costly, as with
good bread, muskmillious, sugar Canes, sweet stalks, and sower grass, or
sedge of the worst; steeres like a hulke, stifnecked, almost all of one piece;
feeds himself with his Trunck or snoute, (that deadly instrument of his rage)
being of a just length ^o the ground; taking his meat with the end thereof, and
winding it up, (or under rather) to his mouth, so eats it; but drinks
therewith at length; his stable is commonly the open air; a massy iron chain
his halter; a great Tree his manger: and the shadie boughs his shelter; and
thus stands this Monster by one of his legs (of like proportion with a post
or a beam) all the day bound to the good bebauior, til occasion release him;
in whose description I have bin somewhat the larger, because God himself calls
him the chief of his ways, Behemoth by name. Job. 40.

Their drink in general (for ordinary) is water, made relishable by art or
nature; by thirst or some preparatiue; and wholesome by a natural concoction,
or a causuall preservatiue; according to each constitution, and the Countries
provision; with a man's own discretion in the use of the creature; every one to
himself herein, being (as we say) either a fool or a Physician, having
sweet meats enough for the former; remedies and receipts (or concei^es) for
the latter. El borach^ (...), mas el aguado ci. says the Spanish proverb.

A friend to sweet meats,
Sobriety may be,
Yet so, a drinker of Wine
you shall never see,
For wine and sweet meats
sound Palats do loath,
But sweet meats and water
are grateful both.
All contraes in Nature
by skill reconciled,
Produce best effects
both to man and Child.
As, drink no longer Water,
but a little Wine,
To the Temperate man
is Counsel Divine;
So, drink no longer Wine,
but a little Water,
To th'intemperate man,
for it keeps him sober.
The Country affoords no Wine but artificial distillations of ^ples, like our
hot waters: very tastfull they are, and wholesome, but not so strong, so full of
spirit as ours, which makes the Moors to prize them far above their own,
and to esteem them for the best present, or Merchandise can be brought them;
only the Portugal Inhabitants in their Towns and Cities (being many and
great) do make a kind of Wine of dried Grapes, or Raysins of the Sun, for
relish and operation the best (I think) in the world, not inferior to the
Spanish Nectar, El vino de San Martin: being pleasant, strong, and cordial,
called Raysin Wine, almost of the color of Alicant, or steelebacke, which
(thanks to our honorable Masters) we were seldom without, or some other, to
concoct the crudity of our not so wholesome Waters, at meals especially, and
never did us any hurt but good, though bought (but not immediately) of an
enemy: for we were wise, and wary enough in that.

Their habit (as I have said) is white, light, and thin, fit for the
Countries heat; but thicker, and richer Clad in the Winter, with Pintadoes,
Silk stuffes, Sattins, and Damasks dyed into all sorts of lively and good
colers, cloth of Gold, Silver, and Tyssue, of their own, whereof they have
plenty, being quilted with a cotton Wool between the outside, and the inner
lining: for their seasons do alter there with a sensible differ^nce as here.

Their Coins in silver, (as for Gold I never saw any that I remember) are
Mamudes and Ruppees; the Mamude in value about 10. pence halfe-penny English;
the Ruppee, more or less as they differ in their names and valuations, of
which there are four or five sorts at least, and the least of them about two
Mamudes and a half, the Ruppee; stamped on both sides with Moorish Characters,
and in form very thick and round; their Copper money whereof they have such
plenty, as (if tolerable for exportation) might prove a good return; being
made into great churlish pieces) they call Pises, whereof 30. (commonly) make a
Mam^dee, and of the rest proportionably; but still after the inconstant current
of the Exchange, almost continually rising and falling, which is in the power
of the Sheraffs, Bankers, or Mony-Changers to alter at their pleasure.

Their Country for the most part (being plain from Hills and Mountains) is
indifferently stored with Mes^ites or Churches very fair and sumptuous; with
(...) also or Villages; Towns and Cities, pleasant, great, and populous:
River*d Walled, Castled, and munitioned; and constantly watered at a certain
yearly season, to wit our Summer: from toward the end of May, to the end of
August, or thereabout, with frequont sober Raines, scarce two fair days
together, without some showers or other, and all the year after so clear a
Firmament, as not a Cloud to be seen, that I have been weary of fair
weather: and this Rayne-water by the better sort is received into Vaults, made
for the nonce, to serve them for their drink all the year after, being
wholsommer (they fay) then their other waters: as also, this Raynie season is
observed of all for the best times to travayle in.

I could yet say more in (...) particulars, but having said enough (I think)
in proof of my Travels, and praise of the Countries goodness: it were
superfluous, and beyond my intent to become Cosmographicall, and therefore I
will here confine my self, being now summoned to a Consultation, determining a
Journey to be made unto the foresaid City of A^adavas, by Master Thomas
Aldworth the Companies chief Agent; my self his second; for Cashier and
Accountant; with four other English, whereof two were homebred Merchants, and
(...) more: to provide goods in readiness for our next Fleet, that the Ships
(to their great damage) might not be deteyned as before.

And for more safety both of goods and lives, our charge we had with us being
of great importance, and the Country (as I have said) very dangerous, by reason
of Thieves, which continually (upon intelligence) ly^ armed in Troops on the
way for booties; we held it best (though otherwise inconvenient) Mocrob Chan
the governor of Surat then traveling toward Court at the Kings command) to
take the benefit of his Lascar or Camp (as also diverse others, it being the
Countries custom in like sort to set forth, or with a Cara^, a Caffala, a
multitude of all sorts of people with their goods to that end gathered
together,) for our more safe convoy, which yet we enjoyed not past one night
aside of Baroch, till we met again at Cambaya, being both our worse and
farther way; For this great Lord with his many hands and much help posting
faster then we could follow with our heavy and slow carriages, lef^vs alone in
the midst of danger, (God only protecting us) being three nights on the way,
before we could reach to Cambaya, and spent two of them (with their
sunschorching days) by the water side, having only our Tent for shelter,
expecting there a boat to pass us over out of that Purgatory, and another of
mischievous minded men, and murmuring Malcontents; Taddiepor Merchants and
heartlesse soldiers; repining not only my charge, but my precedence also (or
next respect unto Master Aldworth, and that by his precise order, against my
own desire, enioynd me) to their ancient matrimony; making me both his
Coach-mate and his right hand at Table; and the more I sought by gentleness
(for the present) to appease their spite, or (in continuance) by some change
of behavior to confront their folly. Pro. 26. 4. 5. the more (like themselves)
they (still conspiring) in both respects mistook, and traduced me; declaring
hereby the implacable disposition of Envy; but God alone did plead my cause,
and (by degrees) put them to silence in their graves.

Here at Sarode (for so the place is called) during, our abode, worthy of
observation, I took notice of some part of Gods omnipotent works of wonder,
in the flux and reflux of that famous River of Cambaya, for fury, not unfitly
called the Boar, for the Tide from the maine sea twice a day, once beginning
to flow (Contrary to common course of nature) comes tumbling in amayne, with
such a roaring noise a far off, of mighty foaming waves (like white ruffes a
bout their proud necks) that it strikes admiration and terror to the
beholder, in such sort that those high banks, with their dry sands and Oaes
are suddenly covered and filled up to the very tops, for the space of many
leagues in length together, yet never overflowed; and upon return, with
expedition leaves it (for the most part) empty and dry again; being (in
absence of the Tide) a firm passage for all that dare adventure it; which
thousands having done (and daily do, though some speed better) not taking
their times aright, or the uncertain Tides deceiving them, upon credible
report (like Pharoes host in thered sea) have been overwhelmed man and beast,
Horse and Camels, Elephants and all, with infinite Treasures swept away into
that Rich Ocean, before (upon too short a warning) they could recover (backward
or forward) the shore again, for the River is of a very spacious breadth in
many places over.

Being here (after much toil in moving and removing our charge from place to
place, for our best advantage against an assault, which we hourly expected,
that we durst not sleep but by short snatches and turns; as also for our
most commodious imbar quing (the best being bad enough in that wild place,)
comes a Barque, receives our selves and goods aboard, and in a late Evening at
a full water we set Sail, and (thanks be to God, who is mighter then the
mighty Waves of the Sea) not without great danger, about Midnight we came to an
Anchor right before Cambaya; and the Sabbath Morning landed in that Rich, Fair,
and neat City, so famous throughout the World.

Being now on shore (notwithstanding in good safety of life) we found our
selves little better then fallen out of the frying^ pan (as they say) into the
fire, for all our goods were presently sequestered, and carried to the Kings
^lfondica^ till his Customs of seven Per Cent. were paid, viz. four in, and
three out: which (according to the value) would have come to a good sum of
money, whereat we were much dismayed, Master Aldworth especially, for his
oversight, or too much confidence in Mocrob Chans favor, whom we often
solicited there almost ^ fortnight, as an Instrument to procure the release of
our said goods (the power (in effect) being in his own hands) but all in
vain, till at last, a few days before our departure thence, Master Aldworth
and my felfe (as at other times) went again to him, and sitting right before
him very near, he eyed me all over, talking mean while to his then small
company, at length bids our Broker ask me concerning the clothes I wore, what
stuff it was? Where made? And other questions; to which I answered him; In
conclusion we took our leave, and went home without a word of comfort; a while
after comes our Broker, and tells Master Ald^orth good tidings from Mocrob
C^an, that if he could procure him my Suite, we should forthwith have our
goods delivered us; no sooner had Master Aldworth moved it unto me, as a favor
which I may not deny him, I told him, what ere it were I would grant it; the
word being spoken, I presently brusht up my amiable Suite, and sent it my Lord
Mocro^ by the hand of our Broker, who brought us the same Evening a Warrant
under his Signet for our goods, which the next morning (to our much content) I
went and cleared, (our charge being more precious then life, and our Reputation
above all.)

But what this humorous Lord did with my Suite, I cannot tell, save (by our
Brokers conjecture) to show unto his women; who for a novelty (though a toy)
was observed to prefer his fancy to half a Kingdom, for he had seen many
as good before, and far better, when (in his greatest pomp) our chief
Agent, with all his Train, in our best bravery presented his Lordship from our
Honorable Masters, the Governor and Company, at our first coming.

During our abode here, we bought sundry Commodities as best liked us, for our
Returns, and (to expel melancholy) that it should not domineere (being too
much occasioned) took our Recreation off the City, Orchards, and Fields; but
above all, to observe the Apes in that peaceable habitation of Banians, did not
a little stir my blo^d with their Apish tricks on the Houses, leaping from
house to house in troops, with their little ones in clusters clutching about
them, making daily work for the Tyler and Mason, by pulling out here a Tyle,
and there a stone, till they had uncovered whole houses in quarters and half
quarter^; and then through the Roof (as ieering the Inhabitants for their
silly patience) made such moppes and mowes at them; such Friscoes and Carieres
to and again; now and then letting fall a stone or a tyle upon their bombasted
heads and thin shoulders, and watching in the fall what became of it, (with
twenty other tricks) that it would make a Thief (as they say) slip his Halter
and leap over the Gallows (if he might) to see the sport; and if a stone
(unlooked for) chanced to come amongst them, that they took in so high a
derision to be disturbed in their Work, that they would fly at a man with
open mouth, as if they meant to swallow him; this goodly sight being also to
be seen a great part of the Country thereabout, whole Fields alive, and the
Trees covered with over-growne Apes and Monkies; Parrats and Paraquites
chattering and leaping from Bough to Bough, till come to the top, and then show
their teeth and their tails to Passengers for a salutation.

Thus, and thus, to and fro, changing our wearied thoughts from sadder objects,
we entertained the way in company of Mocrob Chan and his Las^ar, till the
third day from Cambaya, early in a morning we entered Amada^az, that great and
populous City, the Metropolis of all those parts of Guizerat; famous for
Nobility and gentry, as also for rich trade in variety, Indicoes especially, by
means of a general confluence of most Nations in the world E^glish, Dutch,
Portugals, Jews, Armenians, Arabians, Medes and Persians, Turks and
Tartarians: cum multis alijs: in whose Streets (through the multiplicity of
people) all enforce their passage by their P^ones, or Footmen, with their
spears and other weapons running before the coach or horse, (like Absal^ and
his fifty men. 2. Sam. 15. 1.) Crying Poyce, Poyce, give way there, who serve
as well for like necessities as for State, being in number more or fewer
according to the quality and ability, or the pleasure of the person, which
none of credit are (or dare be) without.

Here we took a house, and settled a Factory, applied our selves to our
business as seasons and occasions were offered; mean while for our better
proceeding we visit the Governor Abdala ^han, and present him; signify the
cause of our coming; desiring his leave and Noble favor in whatsoever case of
Justice we might have cause to use him; for which we should be ready at all
times (most Noble Festus) to show our selves grateful unto his Lordship: Our
suit was accepted, together with our Present; Our selves bid welcome, and a
place appointed us where to sit; being in a spacious and princely Court, in the
midst of a great multitude of Chans and Beagues, or Lords and Gentlemen, that
twice a day morning and Evening duly came to visit him; this being that (I
take it) which is spoken of in Scripture, as of Job in the East, and of other
great men sitting in the Gate, or in public, to hear Causes and do Justice,
every one taking his place according to his degree, or at this great Viceroyes
appointment, having first given him a Salam or low Congee; and all
Crosse-legged on Turkey Carpets spread on the ground, curiously paved or
playstered with plaster of Pallas (as likewise their walls) shining like
Alablaster, whereon they tread with their bare feet (as also in their Churches)
leaving their slip-shooes at the door, or aloof off at the edge of the
Entrance, like a Shoomakers well furnished Shop or Warehouse; All rich, or
brightly attyred (as I have said) according to the season; himself with a few
of the principals sitting somewhat apart, on a little higher ascent at his
Palace door, big enough for his corpulent body, and no more; with no less
Majesty (me thought) in all but that, and the Capateria, or Shoe-makers ware,
then might well beseem the greatest Prince in the World; Drums beating;
Soldiers guarding, Noble and Gentlemen's Servants aloof off in Troops
attending; and Coaches at the Court Gate in thick heaps waiting the
dissolution of this great Assembly; sitting sometimes here, sometimes
removing, but ever in a place presenting both State and delight, for
magnificent buildings; beautiful Ponds and Water-workes; pleasant Orchards and
the like; and in this honorable presence every new Moon the common women of
the City (in their long sloppes and short Coats) present themselves, by
turns, with Timbrels and Dances, wanton Songs, and antique gestures, for their
sport and recreation, so continuing till the Viceroy please to dismiss them;
and all this in general, besides their particular Solemnities, as I have said
before, in the Night seasons; wherewith my Story end^, and welcome Gentlemen to
a short Colation, with thanks for your gentle patience in taking penance at so
homely a pittance, and my well-wishings of good refreshings to you all.

FINIS.
Gentle Reader.
AS I have invited thee: so let me now advise, or rather entreat thee that
having read me, thou will not rashly censure me; my intent throughout was to
give content, not to some but all, which in one respect or other (I hope)
answers my desire; only herei^ lies all my doubt, least offense might be taken
here and there at my seeming Osten tation; but leave that to GOD, whilst my
heart (I am sure) condemns me not; perhaps there may be Cause, and then to
boast, is wisdom both in the Opinion and practice of the wis^st; what I have
done, has been with as much respect to thy good as my own, in removing my
Candle from under a Bushel, to set it fairly on a Candlestick, to the end that
with the light there of I may see, and be seen of all, for of all things I
abhor ^o sit in darkness. Great is the benefit of Light; by it Confusion is
banished, Co^trarieties are known and distinguished, dangers declined, and good
things embraced; It is the eyesight of knowledge from whence proceeds the due
estimation we yield unto men (as all things else) but chiefly for their proper,
and most essential or intellectual parts) even Wisdom (thereafter) to use or
refuse them.

And now (Gentle Reader) for the writing of Books so in general, aword or two
(under Correction) in some defense thereof I hope will not f^ll amiss;
provided that neither Church nor State be dishonored, or any particular person
thereby justly offended. True it is, (and none but the unwise can den^it) that
S^ollers for their rare guists of (...) are most sit to write for public use
(having a thousand times wished my self a Scholar for the singular benefits
that have their confluence to a man by Academicall and well managed Arts;) yet
that all others should be excluded, or not any (that will) of understanding and
honest life (upon good occasion, the Premises considered) should be allowed
of, I know not yet one reason of many (me thinks) to the contrary, to ratisie
that opinion; for if we consider the many benefits for one inconvenience,
thereupon ensuing that stand up to plead for a general tolleration, not one of
a hundred (I suppose) even of Scholars themselves but will join with them in
their ready approbation.

For first of all is not that Noble Science of PRINTING made the more to
flourish? Do not the Masters and Artificers thereof become able, not only for
their private Families, but also Commonwealths men? When their Presses
(through a general supply of Coppies) never want work? Are not Shops the
better furnished with Books, and kept open by a frequent concourse of all sorts
of Buyers, through the variety and choice of matter there to be had for a
small piece of money, to profit themselves by other men's labors of an
incomparable value? Does not the reading of a few harmless lines entertayne
diverse from worse exercises, whom else (perhaps) better things would scarce
content? (...) had it not been profitable for many to have exercised
themselves in writing of some Manuscript, whilst Idleness and illCompany have
been their utter bane and ruin? And how many have improved their parts and
vacant times unto a good sufficiency of doing Service both in Church and
Commonweal, wherein (to the honor and profit of both) they have lived, by
applying themselves to virtuous studie^, and writing their Observations, that
never (perhap^) eat bread in a University? Or why does our State at present
(in a sort) allow of, or connive at this tolleration (under the foresaid
Provisoes) but for these or the like godly and civil policies no doubt?
Besides other reasons which I leave to others; but if none of these will pass
for current, yet could I wish (Gentle Reader) that Travelers (in due honor to
their Travailes) may have a place (though the lowest) in this honorable
Privilege with Scholars and Poets, even for their experience ^ake. A man that
has traveled (says wise Strach) knows many things, and he that has much
experience will declare Wisdom; he that has no experience knows little,
but he that has travayled is (or should be) full of Prudence; to wit, a man of
Counsel and Action; of discourse and resolution; Eccles 34. 9. 10. For they
commonly see and conceive more abroad the^ others sitting at home, as being
deeper engaged upon strange Occurrents; having their senses exercised, their
bodies and minds hardened by sundry difficulties, and surviving many dangers;
diving into the different dispositions of m^n, and observing (from a
selfeknowing knowledge) the good and the evil among all sorts of people;
wisdom also insinuating it self there, after a more familiar fashion then
elsewhere, and thenceforth disposing them (often times) (with small helps, and
due encouragements) unto the weightiest aff^res; in whose short lines may b^e
read large Observations of the Divine Power and Providence, to the Glory of
God, and the public good, by the right use which ingenuous minds make of all
things, and to which ends only they ought to be written; When I travailed I
saw many things, and I understand mo^e then I can express; I was often times in
danger of death, yet was I delivered because of these things. Eccles. 34. 11.
12. To communicate experience (therefore) is as commendable as profitable,
being that which in all ages has ever been allowed of, required, and practiced
by the wisest. Wis. 7. 13. Eccles. 39. 8. Psalm. 40. 10. For experienc^ that is
hid, and treasure that i^ hoarded up, what profit (or not prejudice rather) is
in either? And better is he that hides his folly, then a man that hides his
wisdom or Experience, be it never so little, upon least occasion of doing
good therewith; Eccles. 20. 30. 31. As appears by that slothful Servant, who
hiding his Talent (instead of Modesty) incurred a censure of folly. Mat. 25.
24. 25. 26.

Thus (Gentle Reader) having satisfied thee (I hope;) in my best wishes I
commend thee (as my self) to the protection of the Almighty, and bid thee
heartily farewell in CHRIST.

CHR. FAREWELL.

Eccles. 6. 14. 15. A faithful Friend is a strong defen^e, and he that has
found such a one, has found a Treasure. Nothing does countervaile a faithful
Friend, for his Ex^ellency is v^valuable.
I. PET. 1. Add to your Faith Virtue, or Industry:
ANd now, to shut up (...) Indian Discourse with a word or two of Spain, being
(n^xt unto (...) in Portugal) on Christian shore, my first and only place of
foreign residence; where (if I may not seem to praise my self, having
little else to boast of in the short Catalogue of my good works there, save
only the releasing of an English Merchant out of Prison) I would willingly
entertain anew my Courteous Reader with a short Story of an accident, wherein
God made me the Instrument of much good unto another; but the wise (I hope)
will either discern a cause of my boasting, or ^t the worst will ascribe it to
the common humor of Travailers, who love to tell of things they have seen and
done abroad in the world, and so at least to excuse me, (for amidst all my
extravagant delights, else (I may truly speak it, and (I hope) without offense
to Charity) my heart (even then) was ever prone to honesty; to do good freely;
on occasion ready to show mercy; more delighted to give then to receive; and
faithful in my whole engagements; with an inward ze^le in the performance of
all; in a word, no man's foe (as they say, even in those days) but mine own;
how much more then (to silence all detraction) shall ryper times (on occasion)
afford the same things at least, if not better: ill will it self (if it
please) be Judge.

Deteyned upon some ^mployment at the Tower of Velis Malaga, about sales and
return of goods for England, there chanced into the Road (among other ships,
English and French) ^ertaine Hollanders, that brought a great quantity of
Pic^elingos, or counterfeyt Copper Money of Spain, called (...), and
quartillos, which by stealth at (...) of opportunity they landed and disperced
here and there, as they had dohe (...) other Ports: This in short space came to
be suspected by the plentiful current of the money, (the parties themselves
being gone, left others in danger) hereupon the Ships remaining in the Road
were searched; above all the rest, suspicion was had of certain ^hips
belonging to the business whereon I lay for my Master and others, whereof Mr.
John Pit had the chief charge, being himself at Grand Malaga about other
business, dispatching for England; but they apprehended only his Servant or
Factor one Mr. I ^omas S^edmer, whom they found aboard, ready to go for
Malaga, and thence also for England; him they carried away Prisoner to Motril,
about three leagues Eastward, where he was certain weeks, rackt and hardly
used; how he or the ships were released, I am not so punctual in my
remembrance as to relate, nor is it much material (this being above twenty
years since) yet at length released they were, for the truth then came to
light; and whether by torture or else, I am not certain, Mr. Pit himself as
principal, was laid out for: Officers of the Inquisition, from Motril were
appointed and on the way toward Grand Malaga, to apprehend him: This by a happy
chance (being at the water side to hear news) I understood; I went presently
to my Almazen, or Warehouse; wrote him a word or two of advise, that as he
tendered his life (upon receipt thereof) to retire himself for such a cause,
which I sent by the hand of a Spaniard, a lusty sturdy Companiero, of whose
trustiness I had observed something before, having employed him about styving
our fruit, and other Reca^dos of moment, with a charge to out run the
Constable, corre Juan, vete bolando por su vida, que yo (...) lo pagare, bien
pagado; Run for thy life, and I Will reward thee lib^rally: and so he did, for
over the Rocke^ and high Mountains, (like a Goat) h^ made such a nimble
expedition that he overtooke, and out went the Mule-men, and was there some
three minutes before them, which gave my advised friend, the advantage of his
absence, just as the Alguazill and Officers came at his heels, that made his
life of full value, which else upon any Merchants ensurance there, (by that
time they had ha^per'd him) had not been worth one Marvedi.

This news (till then pensive at heart in expectation of the event) cheered me
up no less then a cup of neat sparkeling wine, especially for the punctuality
of the success, and the applause of my diligent pen; which procured me the
love of those which had never seen me, with munchas Mercedes, y beso las manos,
for my good advise; and afterward upon my return to Malaga, declared it by a
general Bienvenido, or welcome.

And how God did require this small myte of my (not merit but) good will (for
he likes not) to speak after the manner of men) to be long in any man's debt
(but with more advantage to him) though always seeming so by the continual
lengthning out of his mercies (if we observe them) beyond our own time, even
to posterity, from generation to generation; as if by this kind of
acknowledgement of his (for his own word sake) he were still indebted to us
and ours, and could never su^ficiently recompense our good endeavors, by the
utmost of his infinite goodness freely promised thereunto in his best beloved,
his souls delight; to teach us that we should never be weary of doing him like
acceptable service, even for the good and safety temporal and eternal, of our
selves and ours; but chiefly for his own honor and glory.) I could here well
declare in a Cloud of particulers ever since, touching his wonderful
providence in my preserv^tion, protection, and deliverance in, and out of most
imminent dangers, straytes, and extremities, temptations and conflicts; but for
brevity sake (leaving all the rest) I will touch only three, wherein Gods
power, and merciful providence did plainly declare themselves unto my
Conscience, to whose praise alone I speak it, and to stir up all to a
consideration of his wonders.

Not long after this Iubile of success (the brunt of business being ouerpast)
I went to Grand Malaga, whether indeed my desires lead me (contrary toreason)
from Uelis Malaga, where I was left (upon order of my Master) by Mr. Pit. in
the house of a Regidor or Alderman, Senior Pablos Nunnies, for more conueniency
to learn the language, Rregalado, or respected as in their own son; and
growing daily in acquaintance, I began to declare my self in the choice of
those pleasures whereunto my nature most inclined; amongst others, music and
dancing were not the least, which thus occasioned the first of my proposed
dangers.

Lying in the house of Capt^ine Simon Boureman, of best resort in the City by
Eng^ish Merchants, my first Rendeuous in Spain; and being well accommodated
for all things, I fell into a consort-ship with other young men to entertain
an Italian to teach us to dance, who came once a day to our Chambers; and in
taking our turns of exercise, our Tutor unadvisedly commended my promptness,
and the dexterity of my body; whereat one of the Company took pepper in the
nose, and told me (in the contrary terms) I danced like a clown; knowing his
malla^ie, I brake it off with a Jest, and a nippe withal, that made him half
angry; til from Jest to Jest, it grew into plain earnest (being both tender
enough of our small Reputations) and sitting with our usual Company at supper,
he challenged me (as not daring) to fight with him; I told him it was then no
time for such a business, but that (perhaps) he might shortly hear of me, as
half determined to try what mettle was in either; the next morning (I think
unexpected) I went early to his Chamber door, wa^like appointed with my Rapier
and dagger (yet a daily Ornament in those parts, as any part of our apparel,
wherein (be it known to all men) for my own particular, I took no small
glory) and finding it open, in I went as at other times (though illaduised in
that point) where I found him writing; After salutation I told him what I came
for, and that if he meant to acquit his honor (I speak after y^ Spanish
phrase) now was the only time fresh and fasting to walk into the Field, to
prevent Concourse or tumult; My Gallant forthwith changed countenance, yet
making wise to accept the offer went aside, and seemed to make choice of his
weapons (having change of Rapiers by him) and taking a dagger in his hand
(mistrusting no Treachery) suddenly offered to have stabbed me with it, but
happily intercepting the thrust, with his hand that held it, I closed with him,
and in struggling (though his inferior both in age and stature) I gave him the
clean fall backward, on his bed, and fell upon him, setting my knee on his
breast, holding down still his dagger, punching it upward with all his might at
my face, and at length I wrest it from him; yet (the only point of manhood I
observed in him) he made no clamarous outcry for the matter, as knowing
(belike) with whom he had to deal) wherewith (as I told him, to requite his
treachery) I could have slit his nose, or minced his face like a Carbonado; but
mercy and manhood forbade me, as scor^ing indeed the baseness, though enough
prouoakt; nor would I for ten thousand pounds have layne in like sort at his
mercy; At last taking my best opportunity, I suddenly sprang off from him, and
left him alone in his Chamber, free from the least hurt done him, abiding
without in an open Court under a Gallery walk, resting my self between a
marble Pillar and a pack of cloth, leaning on the pomell of my Rapier,
expecting every moment ^is coming forth for the Field, but his intent was to
have finished the combat there, with all safety to himself, and sudden ruin
to me.

For spying me through his door standing at that disadvantage (yet thanks be
to God not walking, for then he had taken me napping) he rusht out suddenly
upon me with a naked Rapier making a main thrust at my face, which again (as
happily as the ^ormer) I put by with my hand, yet not so, but that (glancing my
throat) it touched my beardlesse chinne, and made the blood run down; but
feeling my self alive, I instantly drew (God forgive me all) with a full
resolution to have run him through, as doubtless I had, up to the very
(...), had not the spirit of wisdom or fear made him caper backward with a
leap (I still bless God for it) that I never saw the like. Timor addit alas.
Fear gives wings. But considering the danger of that play (for I had wit in my
anger, though some that beheld us, said, I fought sa^s fear or wit) and
changing my purpose, I followed him close with a double stroke two or three
immediately succeeding, swift as lightning; for though not slightly stirred,
yet being too far provoked, (to the terror of all proud, and commonly
false-hearted provokers, I may justly speak it) my dreadlesse spirit would
then have borne me through the midst of an Army.

In which short conflict, I did so macerate his Arm from the hand to the
Elbow, that it grieves me yet to think of it, (so little do I glory in the
Relation, save only in our mutual preservation, mine own especially from so
imminent destruction) and being gone to our chambers to be dressed, to tell why
certain Spaniards of my acquaintance, and strangers that came then to see me,
did so wonder at my Rapier, feeling the edge with their fingers, (not
considering the principal, that what is done courageously and with expedition,
is thoroughly done. Bis dat gui cit^ dat, to fight courageously is to fight
victoriously) crying (after their fashion of admiration) Jhesus, al Diablo, que
espada es esta? was, because (besides his arm) I had pared off the pappie
flesh under his hand; out in sunder a thick gold Ring from off his finger; and
withal (I suppose) his Rapier, for at the last stroke, that also fell in a
piece with the rest to the ground.

At the sight whereof, Mercy and Manhood again held my hand, without the least
offer to prosecute him any further; whereat (with his own) there was a
sudden Albarote, or outcry of household Servants newly up, Murder, Murder,
and of our English Cook, that had done his best before to have parted us; that
Senior Christoval, had slain Senior Fulano: but (a thousand thanks to God) it
was not so; whereupon (by advise of the best in the house (in secret) not a
little approving the exployt, nor much lamenting (but in show) the other, I
know not why:) to prevent further mischief, I absented my self at Velis
Malaga, making of necessity a Virtue; for there in Company of only one English
Merchant, Capt. Lee by name, I improved my study, wrote them back Spanish
Epistles, and profited mightily; having ever since been a man of peace,
conquering by suffering, and prevailing by yielding, yet not basely neither,
but understandingly too: being minded henceforth (for ought I know) never more
to draw sword, but against the Enemies of God, my King, my Country, and my
Friend: wherein God strengthen my resolution. Amen.

The second was, being in Ireland (a few years after my return from the
Indies, to wear out, or to weaken many discontents diversely occasioned me in
England, by means of an employment I had imposed on my self, begun long
before, but there (for causes) intending to finish it, with some other respects
jointly procuring my absence,) among others, of less Profession, yet better
condition, I chanced to be acquainted with a very Rooke (as some term them)
yet so well clad in a religious habit of smooth discourse, that I durst have
trusted him almost with my life; so dangerous is a fair show without
substance: the word of trust without Truth, the name of a friend, without the
fruits of friendship, or the inspection of wisdom to discern the subtilties
of Hypocrisy, that the very best (of which soever side) are, and have bin
subject to be deceived, that none should be too credulous of fair shows or
reports, as they tender their own good, in cherishing (all they can against
Envy) the due estimation of virtue in themselves or any.

This man (upon a project of some profit, probable enough had his intent been
honest, or my serious studies in higher affairs permitted me to have
freque^ted or suspected him; (but opportunity not so much makes as takes a
Thief, for an honest mind even scorns the temptation, no less then a lewd or
a feigned suspicion) by degrees had wound himself at least ten pounds deep
into my purse, being half way to the bottom, till fresh supplies out of
England; and at last (to make the shortest of a sharkes account) was glad to
accept of one half of my ^cipall, with loss of the other half, yet not
without great profit neither, for a sharp lesson proves a good instruction;
and our best wits are (commonly) the dearest bought; but this is not the
matter, rather ^n Introduction thereunto.

For to get this money I was forced to dispense with my study (to wit K. David's
Psalms, and St. (...) Epistles; a word or two whereof in a short Treatise
touching their praise, since composed by me, I once purposed should have bin
the period, or posterne unto these my Travels) and to make many a journey to,
and against him; among others, taking the pleasure of a dainty frosty Sunshine
morning (whilst my Irish Colt took his recreation at home) I made a walk of
six or 7. miles to speak with him at his house (having changed his dwelling
from the Town into the Country) and on the way from Tullough, between Ballye
Roberts, and Castle-Lyons, went aside out of a fair green Lancher, betwixt
two great open fields under a hedge, to cover my feet, not ^eeing nor
mistrusting any danger, yet (in stooping down) had this thought in my mind;
good Lord preserve me, this may be my last breathing: after a while looking up,
right before me within twice my length stood a great grisly Wolf, bigger then
a Mastiffe, with a long bobbe Tail, p^ick-eard, and a lanke body, stock still
looking on me.

Though somewhat apalled at this strange sight, yet to run * conceived was
danger (for I had wit in my fear, as before in my anger) and therefore quietly
hasting to be ready for him, still fixing my eye on his (wherein lies a
mystery) till I had fastened my point; and drawing my knife, with a sm^l wand
in my hand, I went on guardant, soft and fair, observing how the Curre dogged
me, (for it is a Creature (simply considered) as full of craft and subtilty, as
of greediness and cruelty, which meeting in men (as commonly they lurk
together, one being cause of the other) do make them more brutish and
dangerous (God defend me from them) then wild beasts; such as St. Paul had to
fight withal at Ephesus, (unreasonable and absurd people) as doubtless many
good me^ have elsewhere daily,) and then turning toward him, and standing
still awhile, he would do the like (for I could have bin content, on a fair
defense) to have tried the combat with him, in assured hope to have cut his
throat, to enlarge my Scutchion with a Wolf, or a Wolfes head in a Canton, for
an addition of honor, as well to my Ancestry, as happily to my heirs and
posterity, for God only makes and gives all.

In this sort perusing one another, on we went in company about half a quarter
of a Mile together, till (being Market day at Tullough) people came riding by,
away he went, but with admiration of all (in such sort) to have escaped his
clutches; affirming it to be the He^ or (...) Wolf, that a long time had
ranged thereabout; done much mischief to man and beast; and could never be
taken.

Though now rid of my rude companion, I durst not be too secure, least on the
sudden we might meet again; but ever with an eye in my pole, on I went still
guardant, till I came to Kiel Jannicke, aside off Castle Lions, and there found
my Friend to little or no purpose; but at my return (...) got a rusty sword
for my better defense, in^ case of necessity, which now and then I thought
good to exercise against a bush or a Thistle, with a thrust at the one, and a
slash at the other, supposing the Woolfe to have bin either; perhaps (I am not
sure) like that valiant country Travayler (according to the common Tale) who
going home late in an Evening from work, in like sort laying about him (as he
went) with his Trun^, at the sudden outcry of a few Duckes, quake, quake,
being at his wits end, disclaimed all his former behavior, with a fearful
protest as (who should judge him) to be but a poor Travayler, that never
struck man in his life* nor meant to do; and so more afraid then hurt (having
escaped a scowring) he went soberly home to sleep: as I also being delivered
from my so great a danger at retu^ne to my lodging, on my knees gave God
thanks for my preservation, and still do; For doubtless the same invisible
hand of heaven that shut the ^mouthes of Daniels Lions, did likewise shut the
mouth of this r^uening Wolf, else rea^ to have devoured me My God (says he)
has sent his Angel, and has shut the Lions mouths, that the^ have not hu^*
me, forasmuch as before him, Innocence was found in me, and also before thee (O
King) have I done no hurt. Dan. 6. 22. With the merciful, (says* (...)) thou
wi^t show thy self* merciful, and with an upright man, thou will show thy
self upright. Psalm. 18. 25.

The next and last never to be forgotten, was now of late the 29. of August
1632. passing from the Exchange toward my lodging; in Lothbury from four Story
high, there suddenly fell down into the street (by what means God knows, but
very strangely) a whole Window of glass in a thick frame of Timber, all fast
in a lump together, and in the fall struck only the brim of my hat, missing
my head but two or three inches at most, by means I think) of then mending my
pace, (not knowing why) at the instant (I remember) when I sprang over into
that side of the street, which else (doubtless) had struck me stone dead, so
violent was f^ll; for which let my soul for ever (...) thee (O Lord) and all
than is within meblesse his holy name, ^s two or three of those that saw the
manner thereof (I thank them) put me in mind so to do.

The Angel of the Lord (says David) encampeth round about them that fear
him, and delivers them. Taste therefore and consider that the Lord is good,
blessed is the man that trusts in him; for though his wisdom (to exalt the
glorious Majesty of his power) leads them into temptations and dangers, yet his
vigilant providence (for his promise sake) never leaves them; I will never
fail thee nor forfake thee: Joshua. 1. 5.

Affliction (like Paul's Viper) at first begets censure, but (upon delivery) it
is the cause of honor. Acts. 28. 3. 6. I will be with him in trouble (says
God) I will (...) him, and honor him. Psalm. 91. 15. And what honor comparable
to that of Gods deliverance? Or what promise so to be^ relied on as his word?
what buckler or Ca^le of defense so safe as his protection? what service so
commodious and honorable as his faithful service? or whom ever better served,
allied counseled, or befriended (may examples of Truth and experience take
place, malice with envi^ being banished or put to silence) then by such
Alliance, Servants, Counselors or Friends? whose dwelling is in the secret
place of the most High, and whose abode is under the shadow of the Almighty,
King of Kings, and Lord of Creatures both in Heaven and in Earth, in the Seas
and all deep places. I leave to the judgment and consideration of all, with my
hearty prayers as for my own Soul, that every one for their proper good
(touching the premises in each particular) may rightly discern between things
that differ, and impartially prefer those that excel.

What have I now done? is there not a cause? 1. Sam. 17. 29.
FINIS.
