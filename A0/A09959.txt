A little Catechism, that is to say, a short instruction touching christian
religion, set forth by Theodorus Beza Minister of the Church of God in Geneua.
The first section.
Question. 1 WHerefore has God placed us in this world?

Answer. To know and serve him.

Q 2. Will he be known and served according to our understanding and will: or
according to that, which it has pleased himself, to declare and set out unto
us touching the same?

Answer. According to that which he has declared unto us concerning the same.

Q 3. Where has he declared and set out the same unto us?

A. In that book which we call the Bible, comprehending, together with diverse
histories, the law and the gospel.

Q 4. Who has made this book?

A. God him self, by the ministerye of his holy Prophets and Apostles.

Q. 5. What is the law?

A. The doctrine which teaches us what we ought to do, as well toward God, as
one of us toward an other.

Q. 6. What is the Gospel?

A. That heavenly doctrine which teaches us, what we must believe to our
salvation through Jesus Christ only.

Q. 7. Does this word contain all that which we must believe and do?

A. Yea, without having any need to add or join any thing thereto, or to
take any thing therefrom.

Q. 8. Say now the articles of your belief.

A. I believe in God, the father almighty. etc

The second section.
Q. 1. Does this Doctrine teach us, that there is but one only God, or that
there are more gods then one?

A. It teaches that there is but one God only, and that we may not have more.

Q. 2. Wherefore say you so?

A. Because it must needs be, yt he which is God, should be above all other
things, and therefore he may not have a fellow or companion joined with him.

Q. 3. Yet you in naming God have seemed to rehearse three, that is to say, the
father, the son, and the holy Ghost.

A. In deed there are three persons, in one only Godhead: but yet these three
persons, are but one, and the self same only God.

Q. 4. Mean you that God is divided into three parts?

A. No, for God can not be divided, but I say, that every one of these three
persons is one, and the self same only God altogeathere perfect.

Q. 5. How can this be?

A. It is a mystery or secreat beyond al our understanding, and yet
notwythstandyng most certain and sure, for God has so declared it and set it
forth unto us, by his holy word.

Q. 6. Do you then believe in one only God, the father the son, and the
holy ghost.

A. Yea: and by Gods goodness, will. dye in this faith.

The third section.
Q. 1. How is the son of God called?

A. JESUS CHRIST.

Q. 2. What mean these wordse JESUS CHRIST?

A. Jesus is as much to say, as Savior, and Christ is as much as anointed
and consecrated to be our sovereign king, having power over all creatures, our
sovereign or high prophet, who has fullye declared unto us the will of God his
father, touching our salvation, and our sovereign or high priest, which has
fullye appeased an pacified the wrath of God against us for our sins.

Q. 3. What has he done and suffered to save us?

A. He was conceived by the holy ghost, and borne of the virgin Mary, suffered
under Pontius Pilate, etc.

Q. 4. Can God suffer or dye?

A. No.

Q. 5. Is not Jesus Christ true and very God, eternal, with his father and the
holy ghost?

A, Yea.

Q. 6. How then is he said to have dyed?

A. Because that being very God, he was made man also, to the end that in his
person our nature might bear or suffer the whole punishment due to our sins
and traunsgressions.

Q. 7. Do you mean that the son of God, was changed into man?

A. No, because then he should be no more God: and god can not either change
him self or be changed. But being of himself very God, he has taken our
nature unto himself, that so he might be very god and very man.

Q. 8. If he had not bin God could he have bin our savior?

A. No, for it belongs unto God only to pardon and forgive sins, and to give
eternal life.

Q. 9. And if he had not bin man, could he have bin our savior?

A. If he had not bin man he could not have dyed, and therefore we our selves
should have bin subject unto death.

The fourth section.
Q. 1. Shall all the world be saved.

A. No, for the greater part of the world refuse their salvation.

Q. 2. Who the^ are they which shall be saved?

A. They that have faith and believe.

Q. 3. And what is faith?

A. A certain persuasion and assurance, which every true christian man ought
to-haue, that God the father loves him, for Jesus Christ his sons sake.

Q. 4. Wherefore do you say for Jesus Christ's sake?

A. Because that we being altogether corrupted and wholly perverse in our
selves, God could not love us, but in respect of him only, which is man
altogether just and perfect, that is to say Jesus Christ his son.

Q. 5. Comes this faith of our selves?

A. No, but from the only grace and goodness of God, which does freely give it
to his elect and chosen ones.

Q. 6. And they which have this faith, are they saved?

A. Yea of necessity, for god has given his son to the end that every one
which believes in him, should have life everlasting: and he is not a liar.

The fifth section.
Q. 1. But whereby may a man know whether he have faith or no?

A. By good works.

Q. 2. Which be good works, and which be evil?

A. Those only are good which he himself has commanded, and those evil
which he has forbidden.

Q. 3. Rehearse now the commandments of God.

A. Hear Israel etc. The sum whereof is, thou shall love the Lord thy God.

Q. 4. To know Gods commandments, is not only to know to say them, but men
must also understand that which they say: wherefore I demand of you, what
means that which is said in the third commandment, to take the name of God.

A. It is to name God, which we must never do, but upon just and good cause,
and with fear of his majesty whom we name.

Q. 5. Then it is by stronger and greater reason more forbidden to swear by
God in vain that is to say, to take him for a witness and judge, without just
and good cause why.

A. It is so in deed,

Q. 6. What means it to sanctify the Sabbath day, or day of rest.

A. It is to dedicate and consecrate it to the glory of God.

Q. 7. Ought we not also to dedicate unto him all the rest of the days of our
life?

A. Yea, but this day is particularlye and cheefely ordained for this end and
purpose.

Q. 8. Do men forbid to travail or work on the Saboth day, as though to
labor were a thing evil of it self?

A. No, but they forbid ordinary and usual labor, to do a work which is
better and more profitable.

The sixth section.
Q 1. You have said that they only are good works which God has commanded.
Wherefore tell me can we accomplish and fulfill the commandments of God?

A. No, not so much as begin to do any thing, but by a certain singular and
special grace of God. Yea there never has bin or shall be a man, excepting
Jesus Christ only, which has perfectly fulfilled y^ same.

Q. 2. Wherefore say you so?

A. Because God will save us through his only mercy in Jesus Christ.

Q 3. Yet so it is that a good life is the way to salvation.

A. It is true that repentance and amendment is joined with the forgiveness of
our sins: but yet it follows not therevppon, that we be saved by our works.

Q. 4. And why shall we not be saved by our works seeing that they are good?

A. Because they be not good enough for that purpose.

Q. 5. Wherefore then are they good?

A. To set forth Gods honor: to win or else to strengthen our neighbors,
and to make us know and feel in our selves, that we are the children of God.

Q. 6. Good works then make us not Gods children?

A. No, for contrariwise a man must first be the child of GOD, before he can
do good works: but this is a mark or badge, whereby men may know the
children of God.

Q. 7. What then makes us the children and sons of God?

A. The only grace and mercy of God, by his holy spirit, because he has
elected and chosen us from before all euerlastingnes, according to his good
pleasure.

The seventh section.
Q. 1. The holy ghost then is he which makes us the children of god: but what
instruments or means, does he ordinarily and commonly use to bring us to that
honor and keep us in the same?

A. The preaching of the word prayer, and the use of the sacraments.

Q. 2. What call you preaching of the word?

A. An exposition of the writings of the Prophets and Apostls, which is don in
the Church, by such as he has called to that holy ministry: of Whom it is
said the that receives you receives me.

Q. 3. And how do you pray?

A. Saying. O our father which art in heaven. etc.

Q. 4. To whom speak you these words?

A. To God the Father.

Q. 5. How is he your father, seeing that he has but one only son, that is
to say JESUS CHRIST?

A. First, because that Jesus Christ his eternal son being made man, is
become our brother: secondly, because he loves me in Jesus Christ his son,
with a greater then a fatherly love and affection.

Q. 6. Albeit then that you direct not your speech and words either to the
son or to the holy ghost, yet you do not exclud or shut out eyeher the
one or the other.

A. No, For I can not call him Father, but in the name of his son JESUS
CHRIST, nor pray unto him but by the holy ghost.

Q. 7. And is it not lawful for a man to frame or make his prayer to the
person of the son and of the holy ghost.

A. Yea in deed. For seeing that the three persons are one only, and the
self same God, invocation or prayer does equallye belong unto them. And
whether I call upon the father in the name of the son by the holy ghost, or
that I make my prayer unto the son to lead and bring me to the father, or
that I pray the holy ghost to teach me the father and the son, all comes
to one.

The eight section.
Q. 1. And what is a Sacrament?

A. It is a thing which God sets before men's eyes in his church, to signify
unto us for our salvation, an other thing which men see not.

Q. 2. And wherefore has God ordained these signs to his promises?

A. For to make us so much the more assured of the certainty of them.

Q. 3. How many such signs are there in the christian Church?

A. Two, that is to say, Baptism, and the holy Supper.

Q. 4. What see you in Baptism?

A. Water.

Q. 5. What does this water signifye unto you?

A. The blood of Jesus Christ.

Q 6. To what end?

A. To make clean my sins, as the water being occupied, makes clean the
filthiness of the body.

Q 7. Does this water make clean and purge sins?

A. No, but it signifies unto me that which washes my sins, to wit, the
blood of Jesus Christ.

Q 8. Mean you that this matter or substance of the blood of Jesus Christ
washes our souls?

A. No, for our souls can not be cleansed with any matter as our bodies. But this
blood makes me clean, because ye Jesus Christ has shed it for satisfaction
and full recompense of my sins.

Q. 9. Is there then any difference between the water of Baptism, and common
water?

A. No, as concerning the matter and substance (for it is always water) but
there is very great difference, as concerning the use: for the common water
serves to wash and make clean our bodilye filthinesses, and the water used in
Baptism, is a sacrament, of the washing of our souls.

The ninth section.
Q. 1. What see you in the supper?

A. The bread and the wine, which is there given and received according to the
ordinance and institution of God.

Q. 2. What does this bread and this wine signify unto you?

A. The bread signifies to me, the body crucified for me, and the wine
signifies unto me, the bloudde shed out for me.

Q. 3. To what end?

A. To testify unto me, and to assure me, that even as this bread and this
wine, are ordained for y^ maintenance and nourishment of this life, so our
Lord Jesus Christ has given his body and his blood for me, and gives
himself to me, to the end that from him, as from a fountain there may flow
unto me eternal life.

Q. 4. Are this bread and wine our spiritual nourishment?

A. No, but they signify unto us that from whence very eternal life it self
proceeds, that is to say, from him which has suffered his death and passion
to take away the cause of our death, that is to say sins, and to renew us unto
eternal life, through a spiritual liuelines, which rests and remaineih in him.

Q. 5. Is there any difference between the bread and wine used in this
sacrament, and common bread and wine?

A. No, as touching the matter and substance (for it is always bread and
wine) but there is very great difference, as concerning the use: for ordinary
and common meats are appointed for the use of this present life, but this
sacrament is ordained to signify and seal unto us our spiritual and
everlasting nourishment.

The tenth section.
Q. 1. Wherefore has the Lord ordained and instituted two signs in his holy
supper seeing that in Baptism there is but one only?

A. To assure us that he does not feed us to the halues, but wholly, being not
only our meat but also our drink.

Q. 2. Where is Jesus Christ now according to his humane nature?

A. In heaven, from whence he shall come to judge the living and the dead.

Q. 3. By what means can you then which are on the earth receive him?

A. As I receive with my hand and my mouth the sacrament, that is to say,
that bread and that wine, for the nourishment of this body, even so by the
virtue, and power of the holy Ghost, I do inwardly and in my soul receive
and embrace through faith our Lord Jesus Christ, very God and very man,
that by him I may live eternally.

Q. 4. Do they which have no faith receive Jesus Christ in the supper?

A. No, for Jesus Christ is not received but by faith, yet do they in deed
receive the sacrament, but to their condemnation.

Q 5. How so?

A. Because that they make no difference between common bread and common wine,
and that which is the sacrament of the body and blood of Jesus Christ, whom
they reject and throw from them through their unbelief.

Q 6. How must a man prepare himself t^ come worthily to the supper?

A. If he have true repentance of the life yt is passed, confessing their sins
before God, and amending them toward God and his brethren, so much as in him
lies, with aful^ deliberation and purpose to be better in time to come, and
embracing Jesus Christ by a^ true faith in his promises and sacraments for the
alone and only savior,

Q. 7. But has Jesus Christ left it unto our liberty and choice* whether we
will go to the supper, or not go to it?

A. In forbidding men to resort thither unworthily, he commands all them
which have judgment and discretion, to prepare themselves yt they may repair
worthily to it.

God give us all grace to go to it to his honor and glory, and to our
salvation. So be it.

A prayer to be said of children before they study their lesson.
Wherein shall a child address his way, in guiding himself according to thy
word O Lord Open our eyes and we shall consider the merueilous things of thy
law. Give us understanding, and we shall keep thy law, yea we vvil I keep
it with our heart.

O Lord which art the fountain of al wisdom and knowledge, seeing it has
pleased thee to give us the mean to be taught in our young age, to know how
to guide our selves holily and honestly, in all the rest of our life hereafter
to come, let it please thee also to lighten our understanding (which of it
self is blind) that it may comprehend and receive that doctrine and learning,
which shall be taught us, confirm also and strengthen our memory to keep it
well: dispose our hearts to receive the same willingly, and with such desire
as is mete, least that through our unthankfulness, the occasion that thou do
offer unto us, should perish and be lost. To this end power upon us we pray thee
thy holy spirit, which is the spirit of all understanding, truth, judgment,
wisdom and learning, which may make us able to profit so well that the pains
which shall be taken in teaching us be not lost. And to whatsoever study, that
we apply our selves, grant that we may refer it to the true and right end,
which is to know thee, in our Lord Jesus Christ, that we may have full
trust of our salvation and eternal life in thy grace, and may serve thee
vpryghtlye and purely, according to thy good pleasure, so that all that which we
shall learn, may be an instrument to help us thereto. And seeing that thou do
promise to give wisdom to the little ones, and such as are humble, and on the
otherside to confound the proud in the vanity of their wits and
understandings: and likewise to make thy self known unto them that be of
an vpryghte heart, and on the otherside to make blind the wicked and ungodly,
we beseech thee to fashion and subdue us to true humility, that thereby we may
be made apt to learn and obedient also, first unto thee, secondly unto our
superiors which thou have appointed to govern and teach us. Moreover we
heartily prayer thee to dispose and frame our hearts, unfeignedly to seek thee,
for saking all fleshly and evil affections, and that we may now in such sort
prepare our selves, to serve thee hereafter in that estate and calling, which
it shall please thee to ordeine and appoint for us, when we shall come to age.
Hear us O father of al mercy, thorovv our Lord Jesus Christ. So be it.
